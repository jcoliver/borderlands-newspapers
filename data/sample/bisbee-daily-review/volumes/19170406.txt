SECURITY ASSURED
Although much remains to be done,
officials believe the nation's destinies
are secure now, no matter how stub

wide the scope of German intrigue.
The slowly maturing preparedness
sentiment has borne fruit in military,
naval and industrial preparations
which already have put the United
Stataee on a defense basis not even
hoped for two years ago.
NAVY IN FINE SHAPE
The navy, always the first line of
defense, has cleared its decks of an
tiquated incumbrances, has added new
unit modernized, to meet the German
tactics and the co-operation of ship
and material makers is hurrying to
'completion other mighty fighting craft

000 men, the navy already has almost
attained the total. .A newly organ
ized coast patrol of submarine chaser
i on duty and hundreds of small craft
to augment it are under construction.
ARMY PLANS ON WAY
Army preparations are less com
plete because of the uncertainty jver
what congress will authorize. The
regulars, numbering nearly 120.000 and
trained and equipped in a way which
their officers believe makes it equal

months of service at the border al

vice for police duty throughout the
country and can be fully mobilized on
short notice Without additional au
thorization by congress the regulars ,
and guardsmen could be recruited to'
a combined strength of 700,000. De-
tailed plans for whatever larger army
may be authorized hav been prepared
and great quantities of equipment pur
chased. Industrial preparations have pro-1
duced a great, compact scheme of na
tional resources with almost unlimited
possibilities. The council of national ''
defense, in daily conference with the
nation's leading financial committee !
has not only worked out definite indus
trial mobilization plans; but has se
cured the endorsement and pledges of
the men which can put it into effect
at a moment's notice, bringing to the
military arms of the service the full
resources of the nation.
For military reasons only a small
part of the detail of these prepara
tions has been made public. It la
known, however, that for many
months the government has strained
every resource to make ready. It is
apparent that Germany again has mis
judged if she thought to find the Un

ARMY WITHIN TWELVE MONTHS
. IJy lteview Leased Wire)
WASHINGTON. April 5. The vast
scope of the administration's plans
for a war army and navy were reveal
ed today after a military budget of
$3,400,000.00 Ohad been submitted to
congress. In broad terms it is pro
posed to quadruple ' the enlisted
strength of the navy and have in ser
vice within a year an army of a mil
lion trained men including the first
ot'O.OoO to be brought to the colors by
selective conscription.
Hills to carry out the program al
ready are in the hands of the con
gressional military-and naval com
mittees. The budget is divided so that $2.
932.000.000 goes to the1 army and
$468,000,000 to the navy. These sums
are in addition to the regular army
appropriation bill of $240,000,000 and
appropriations totalling $317.273,S02
already available for the navy.
The navy's task will be to raise the
present enlisted strength of 68.700 to
197.1100 in the shortest possible time.
It is estimated it will cost $175.5S5.761
to do this. A lump sxifu appropriation
of $292. ooS.790 is asked to cover new
construction and all other material
charges.
The army hill, drafted by the gen
eral stafT. has been approved by Pres
ident Wilson and the department de
cided today to make it public upon
passage of the war resolution by the
house.

As jwt there is nothing to indicate
that the compulsory service proposed
for the army will be applied to All up
the navy. An average of 250 new
men a day is being added to the ser
vice and officials hope to find a great
flow of volunteers when congress sets
all machinery in motion.
"What we will term the 'material
estimate'," Secretary Daniels said,
referring to the navy budget submit
ted today, "is to provide for addition
al ships, guns and ammunition, va
rious articles of ship's equipment, ma
terial and supplies of various kinds
for aviation, storage facilities, for
ordnance supplies, addi'tional employ
es at navy yards, and to meet the add
cd expenses of the navy department.
"I have put this estimate in budget
form because it is almost impossible
at this time to say with any degree
of accuracy just how much will be
needed for a particular purpose."
The text of the promised paragraph
in the war appropriation is as follows
"For actual and necessary expendit
ures for the naval establishment and
the navy department and any and ev
ery purpose connected therewith, in
addition to any and all other appro
priations heretofore, to be expended
at the decision and at the discretion
of the President and to remain avail
able until expended $292.53S.790: pro
vided, that limitations imposed by ex
isting law shall not apply to the ex
penditure of this fund."
WAR SUMMARY
Momentous operations are under
way hy the Russians who, driving
. from Persia have raptured the Meso
potamian frontier towns of Khanikan
and Kasrichirm and joined hands
! with the advance forces of the Brit
ish coming up from Bagdad. The
Turks however, are making a stand
! against the Russians in this region to
prevent them from crossing the Diala
river northwest of Khanikan.
On the eastern front, according to
pi-trograd, the Russians have reached
he i iiiht hank of the middle Stokhod
river on the left bank of which the
Germans defeated them Wednesday.
Petrograd admits that of two regi
ments of the fifth Russian tide divi
sion, only a sinal' number of hc men
were able to cross the river. Heavy
fighting has taken place between the
i Austro-flermans and Russians in
northern Galicia.
On the other fronts no actions of
, great moment have taken place.

WAR DECLARED
(Continued Frm Page One)
8C Speak; More Waiting
WASHINGTON, April 6. By
two o'clock this morning more
than eighty representatives had
made speeches on the war resolu
tions and many others were wait
ing for an opportunity to speak.
House leaders predicted it would
be at least an hour before a vote
would be reached.
Just before 2 o'clock Mrs. Ran
kin, representative from Monta
na, who had waited in her office
through mot of the evening, en
tered the chamber and tooka seat
Passage Assured
...WASHINGTON. April 5. The
House debated the war resolution
all of today and far into the night,
and although the passage was as
sured before adjournment, the
leaders predicted that a vote
could not he reached until early
morning.
.. For the most part the discuss
ion proceeded with an air of un
emotional acquiescence, scores of
members making brief speeches
to put themselves on record as
reluctantly accepting war as the
only course of honor.
Opposition Grows
During the day the debate re
veated unexpected strength in the
minority opposing the resolution.
Confident predictions of not more
than a dozen votes against it gave
place tonight to reports that the
opposition might muster upwards
of a hundred on the final roll crul
and supporters of the resolution
concluded that the number to vote
in the negative probably would
be more than fifty.
Kitchin Leads Bolters
This surprising accession to
reports that the opposition migatfj
the minority ranks was attribut
ed to the efforts of Democratic
Leader Kitchin, who too kthe floor
and in a dramatic speech an
nounced that he could not with
a clear consc ience vote for war.
Supporters of the President's
course were not concerned over
the defection, however. Sure of a
great majority, they permitted
the roll call to be delayed only so
that everyone might be heard.
Shortly before midnight, after the
debate had continued for more than
13 hours, those in charge of the reso-
lution predicted that a vote would be .
taken soon after one o'clock. There
was no certainty that it might not be .
hours later, however.
Mr. Kitrhin's opposition drew an
immediate following grom among the
group who have opposed preparedness
find armed neutrality and tonight ma
ny who had sat silent and plum in
the rear of the chamber throughout
the day moved down in front and
spoke against the resolution. One of
the most earnest speeches in behalf
of the President's course came from
Republican Leader Mann, who eleclar-
ed Germany had deliberately affront-
ed this country and that only war
could save the national honor.
Representative Fitzgerald. Demo
crat of New York, said he would vote
for the resolution and was willing to

WASHINGTON. April 5. Debate on
the war resolution began in the house
after ten o'clock this morning and
continued through the day and into
llii- nihl. House Icailcis having de
cided to permit all members whe de
sired t speak on the resolution.
D'-UiO'-ratic leader K''' h"t was i
I among those who spoke against the
! resolution. Mr. Kitchin said no inva
jsion was threatened and no vital right
con tested.
J "Are we quite sure." he said, "that
the resolution for war is liie destruc
tion 'of American lives rather than
jthe destruction of American property?
We did not wage war on Mexico. W'e
' were willing to forego our rights with
j Great Britain and with Mexico rather
1 thau to plunge into war. I approved
that course then and now."
Hurray For Heflin
Representative Heflin of Alabama.

j Representative Sloan. Republican
Jof Nebraska declared that the sober
; second thought of the American peo
iple including-congress is being felt
and that 10 days delay of the vote
jw'ould defeat the resolution in its pres
ent shape.
Lenroot Sees Rightly
Representative Lenroot of Wiscon
sin, Republican said he would support
the resolution because not to do so
i would mean "that we will submit to
Germany warring on us without using
force to prevent it."
He denied that Kngland, in planting
! mines in the N'ortli Sea had violated
1 international law.
All Want to Talk
j Toward 7 o'clock Chairman Flood,
I in charge of the resolution sought an
agreement to have the committee of
the whole rise at 8 o'clock and report
;the resolution In the hvuise with a view
i to early action. There was imme
diate action. Speaker Clark said ev
erybody ought to have a right to apeak
'and the house should stay in session
j until early hours or the morning or
'all night if necessary.
' Mr. Flood then withdrew his request
'and speeches were resumed.
Representative Barnett of Alabama,
in the course f a speech against the
resolution challenged Representative
Heffin to circulate a petition in the
house to secure support for his declar
ation that Majority Leader Kitchin
should resign. He also asked his col
league to pi'jve himself consistent by
enlisting as a private in the army: In
, ter-changes between the two Alabam
ans were made to the accompaniment
of applause from the chamber and the
galleries. Heflin unable to ge: rec
ognition insisted on replying, shout
ing that he would resign and tight foi
his country. Burnett continued hh
heckling despite the roars of the mem
bers and the p'jumling of the gavel by
"Representative Fitzgerald until the
sergeant-at-arms produced the mace
symbol of the authority of the housi
and compelled him to take his scat.
Mann Votes For It
Shortly before nine o'clock Repre.
: sentative Mann the Republican leadet
took the Uoor to support the res'jlu-
tion. He praised the courage of thos
opposing but said there was nothing

BY REVIEW
NEW YORK. April 5. Liquidation
and short selling continued with in
creased vigor and breadth in the
stock market today in the further ab
sence of public support. Heaviness
of investment rails was a striking
feature, giving rise to reports of a
recurrence of foreign offerings.
Greater weakness prevailed among
the prominent industrials.
A considerable part of today's sell
ing was ascribed to traders who were
loth to hold their outstanding con
tracts over the holidays. This was
balanced, however, by the heavy col
ume of short offerings which centered
around the more volatile issues.
U. S. Pteel held its accustomed
place as leader. Bethlehem Steels
were four to five points lower. All
the active metals, oils, leathers, pap
ers and utilities were 2 to 3 points
lower.
I Coalers were most freely offered of
t A.ie ra;is. Reading, Not folk and West -
' Prn ihigh Valley and the Erics be-
were only nominally above lowest lev
els. Total sales 920.000 shares.
Bonds were irregular but mainly
lower, the international division how
ever, recording no material alteration
Total sales, par value, $4,559,000 V.
S. bonds were unchanged on call.
CHICAGO METAtS
CHICAGO, April 5. Wheat valnes
whirled upward today five cents
pbove previous top records, impelled
in a great degree by disturbing crop
reports from Kansas and Nebraska
and by Washington news of proposed
immediate war loans that aggregate
billions. The close was flurried at
net advances of 35A to 5i with May
at 2.0:. to 2.06 and July 1.75 ',4 to
1.75. Com finished lt to 2 up
and oats gained at to 1 . In
provisions there was an ascent rang-
ing from 20 to 65 cents. Corn rose
with wheat to a new top level for the
season. Meagreness of rural offer
ings handicapped the bears. Oats
had some independent strength on ac
count of export sales of 2,000,000
bushels so far this week.
Provisions rose to new heights with
corn and hogs.

i W YORK. April 5. Liquidation
ipcvrnil throughout the day. The
u!cr is apparently entertained by the
"ai-irity that a report will be made
i will be taxed severely for an
indefinite term and that therefore the
potential value of corporate shares
is likely to be detracted from. In ad
dition of course there will be many
restrictions to which the business and
financial community will have to con
form through most of the altering
many methods which for a long time
have prevailed. Therefore the action
of the stock market is uot surprising
and further liquidation and further
selling will likely be encountered un
til further tendencies are more clear
ly defined.

Start Tomorrow

Every Morning
Get In the habit of drinking a
glass of hot water before
breakfast
We're not here long, so let's maSe
our stay agreeable. Let us live well,
eat well, digest well,; worlt well, sleep
well, and lc'Jk well What a glorious
condition to attain, and yet, how very
easy it la - if one will only adopt the
morning inside bath.
Folks who are accustomed to feel
dull and heavy when they arise, split
ting headache, stuffy from a cold, foul
tongue, nasty breath, acid st'omach.
can, instead, feel as fresh as a daisy
by opening the sluices of the system
each morning and bushing out the
v.'hole of the internal poisonous stag
nant matter.
Everyone, whether ailing, sick or
ell, should, each morning, before
breakfast, drink a glass of real h')t
water with a teaspoonful of limestone
phosphate in it to wash from the
stomach, liver and bowels the previous
day's indigestible waste, sour bile
and poisonous toxins; thus cleansing,
sweetening and purifying the entire
alimentary canal before putting more
food into the stomach. The action of
hot water and limestone phosphate on
an empty stomach is wonderfully in
vigorating. It cleans out all the sour
fermentations, gases, waste and
aridity and gives jne a splendid ap
petite for breakfast While you are
enjoying your breakfast the water and
phosphate is quietly extracting a largr
volume of water from the blood anil
getting ready for a thorough flushing
of all the inside organs.
I The millions t people who are
bothered with constipation, biliou?
spells, stomach trouble; others wh
have sallow skins, blood disorders at""
sickly complexions are urged to get r
quarter pjiind of limestone phosphaf
from the drug store. This will co
very little, but Is sufficient to niaV
anyone a pronounced crank on t"
subject of luside bathing before breal:

"No one of us wanted war. but we're In it it's a man's
sized job. and we must win I want to help."
It showed the young fellow had been thinking. He was
barely twenty-one, and he had just enlisted in Uncle
Sam's navy at the recruiting office here.
It is that sentiment one hears today above all others
every man feels he must "do his bit.'
There is no glamor in war for any of them. They know
it means all the horrors of hell. But they realize that this
individual does not count like the nation's future and the
generations of the future the children -and they shall
not hesitate
Bisbee is a man's camp full of big, robust men.
They have been doing a man's work in peace.. Undoubt
edly they shall put their hearts into the new work with
double the enthusiasm.
Not prone to shout their patriotism from the house
tops, in the past because there was no occasion for it
they will nevertheless, not be found wanting now Rath
er, they will steal silently away by t os and '.hrecs .!
the nest thing their friends will hear from them, will Ik
somewhere with the colors.
The most optimistic no w does not .oubt dizl i...e
be trouble along the border so one of the first calls upo
Arizona will be to bring up the regiment of Infantry to
2004 men, with additional auxiliarits. Men will be needc :
just as badly for the Mexicon situation as across the sea .
and perhaps a lot quicker. Every man in an Arizona uni
form will get all the thrills he's looking for in the net far
distant future.
THE LOYAL ALIENS.
The sentiment of German-Americans and others is rap
idly changing. Yesterday, for instance, a German sailor
off one of the interned ships was engaged in conversa
tion. He said there are six or eight of his crew right here
in Bisbee. He also said he wished he could file applica
tion for admission as a citizen of these United States,
but that he feared officials would look upon him with
suspicion. He had been here but a short time, but he
could see, be said, where the life was a freer one, the
opportunities' far greater, than in his. own home land,
and that he wished to stay, work in peace, and become a
member of the community. A lot of Germans have been
going across to Mexico lately, he said, but as for himself
be would "rather be in jail in this country than at liberty
below the border." if it were necessary for him to go to
jail, which is unlikely. Most of those who went, he said,
left fearing they would be herded together in this coun
try, or have . their earnings confiscated. Few went to
foment disturbance against this country. But the migra
tions have nearly ceased, he said, as those remaining are
now confident they will not be molested in any way, and
shall be free to enjoy America just as much as any otlitr
rerson In America.
FREEING THEIR FATHERLAND.
"This is no war against Germany or the Germans,
writes an American citizen of German birth, "but again . 1
autocracy, against the Hapsburg, Romanoff, and princi
pally against the Hobenzollern dynasty. The Romanoffs
are now outside the struggle -and the Hapsburgs will be
next. May Providence lend a hand to have the Hohen
zollerns follow suit. They are- and have been the great
est enemies that finst nation, the German people, ever
had. This war is the fight of democracy against wicked,
selfish, demoralizing autocracy.
"Those German-Americans who can grasp this great
subject and have by living in this blessed land learned
the value of its wonderful government (no matter how
many little defects it possesses) will not hesitate to take
up arms to fight the German government
"Out of love for their own land of birth, out of love
for their own nationality, they should help to free that
great, mighty German people from that form of govern
ment which, if it should win, would be the damnation
of the moral-political world.
"May they try to restore the respect which the Ameri
cans had for their intelligence, their sense of honor, and
which some of those 'Kultured' Germans destroyed."
Every word of this letter is true, sane and patriotic.
The views it expresses have been held by the majority
of Americans since the conflict began. They have stead
ily gained strength as it proceeded. Today they are held
almost unanimously.
Citizens of German origin have naturally been slower
than Americans of an older generation to grasp the real
import of the struggle, but little by little they have had
their eyes opened. They have been convince, to their
;orrow, by the acta of the German government itself. It
might surprise some critics to learn how widely the loyal
sentiments expressed by this writer are held by our Ger
man population.

THE MEXICAN C0NGRE6SW0MAN.
The fact that the Congress of the United States had
been called for an early extra session is all that saves
to Congresswoman Rankin the glory of being the first
woman to bold such an office on this continent That
honor would otherwise have gone to Senorita Hermilda
Galiudo of Yucatau.
This legislator will take her place in tbe Congress of
the United States of Mexico when it meets on May 1.
She was elected deputy from the fifth lectoral district
of the Federal District of Mexico.
Law making is not her only field. Senorita Galindo a
manager of The Modern Woman, a magazine published
in Mexico City. In her own state of Yucatan women al
ready .have suffrage. She is working to extend political
freedom for women throughout the Spanish speaking
American countries. As a public speaker she has been
successful. Her campaign speeches were enthusiasti
cally received in the many different sections where they
were delivered. Her work for suffrage is well known in
Cuba, where she has spent time and energy in the cause.
The people of our own United States haven't any time
for patting themselves on the back because of the polit
ical land economic freedom so far granted American
-
wouen. 'If tliey are to.kecp ahead of tlieithcr countries
of Hie Western Hemisphere they've got to work hard
ami steadily.
HELPING FRANCE. ,
The suggestion that the United States should cele
brate her entrance into the war by a liberal gift to
France, in belated payment of the debt we have owed
her from our revolutionary days, is receiving strong sup
port from many sources. Says the New York World:
"The United States ought to give France $1,000,000,000
without a day's unnecessary delay not as a loan, but
as a gift as a new proof of affection and friendship. We
a veil afford to do it, and it would be the most effective
ar measure thnt could be adopted. A gift of fl 000 00

. ....' c.r... :. c.
. niauy than a;:y army we could recru.t or any other
jlicy of resistance to German rutblessness that we
uld adopt.
""v ry schoolboy krews what France meant to thc-
n..ed Slates when :he late of demctra y trembled n
a balance. We have no moral right to mean less o
France in 1917 than France meant to our forefathers hi
,7... We are the richest country in the world. We ha e
jverything that the French require, and 'we cannot give
t too quickly or too lavishly. A billicn American dollars
are worth more to France today than a million American
i oops. The dollars and what they will buy can be mo-
.ilized at once. They win carry new heart and courage
to the French people and relieve the French7 government
i the gigantic financial burden under which it is strug-
ling."
Such a sum, vast as it is, would probably no more
han repay the actual expenditure made by the French
nation in our behalf in the revolutionary war, with in
terest up to date. We have never paid a dollar of either
principal or interest on that debt France has never
isked us to and has never expected us to. But why, in
deed, should we not do for her now, out of love and
gratitude, what she did for us so whole-heartedly a cen
tury and a quarter ago?
It Isn't merely that old debt of gratitude we owe.
There is a vast new debt whose sum we have not yet
begun to reckon. Americans are just beginning to see
that France, Belgium, England and Russia, too have
been fighting our battle, that they have stood between
Germany and world-wide aggression and therefore b-
tween Germany and us, that today they protect us from
German envy and vengeance, that in their victory lies our
own safety. France in particular represents our own
ideals, and is bleeding white in a battle which, if it pre
serves her own democracy, will safeguard ours.
In helping France, therefore, we help ourselves. A
great gift to her would be not only payment of a debt of
honor, but it would be good strategy. It would also con
vince a critical world that we care less for war profits
than we do for our own ideals and tbe good opinion of
mankind.
2,000,000 ARMY
NEEDED AT ONCE
(Continued troiu i'ajje One)
ganize, train and command the units j
of the new army.
A year from now, a second incre
ment of 500,000 youths would be call
ed out another 100,000 officers and
non-commissioned officers would be
drawn from the regulars, the national
guard forces, or from the first section
of the new army, to officer and train
the second section. By that time the
machinery that had been built up
would provide enough trained officers
and non-commissioned officers to
train a million or more men at a time
if ..hat were necessary.
The war department bill, however,
proposes to authorize now only the
first two clauses of the new army,
aiaking a total of more than 2.000.000
trained troops available possibly with
in a year and a half, or in two years
at tbe most.
Tje sum of nearly $3,000,000,000
asked of congress to carry out this I
program deals only with the first year :
of preparation. Behind it stands the
need of an equal sum for reserve sup
plies of ammunition, cannon and oth
er war material, if the army is to be
employed in actual war.
Included in the present estimates
are te cost of cantonments to house
the troops. Presumably tbe previous
plans of the general staff for sixteen
military districts will be carried out. i
is would provide for sixteen com-1
plete and fully equipped districts and I
wvile it is not proposed to create any'
additional tactical units of the nation-!

in the gaps in the present guard I

t"ff officers regard the plan pro
osed as the most effective that could '
be worked out to meet the present I
emergency. They regard the expan

BENSON RESIDENTS 1
PROVE PATRIOTISM
IN UNIQUE MANNER
Rancher Who Told Daughter)
She Need Not Participate In
Flag Salute Changes Mind
When Committee Visits Him.
Miss Elsie Tolls Urges County
Teachers to Adopt Patriotism
. As a Regular Course of Study
1
Residents of Benson several days '
ago enacted a serious little comedy
that might pass under the name of a
popular song that runs: "If You
Don't Like Your Uncle Sammy, then
go Back to Your Home O'er the Sea,"
etc.
Here is how it happened: Pupils
at the Benson school have adopted
the flag salute, and every morning
before class, the young folks assem
ble in front of the building and prove
their allegiance to Old Glory. One
little girl told her father of the flag
salute, and he told her that she need
not follow the patriotic custom. On
hearing of liis attitude a -ommittee
of loyal Americans went to the ranch
er's house and informed him that
they would be pleased to have him i
come to the school the following morn''
ing and participate in the flag salute
with his' daughter. He was politely
informed that if he did not care to
do so the residents of Benson would
be willing that he should move to
some less patriotic spot. The ranch
er accepted the incitation and saluted
the flag the next morning with as
much dignity a sthe most loyal little
Americans who stood beside him.
Postoffice is to issue 5 cent stamped
envelopes in an effort to eliminate tha
short postage nuisance, especially on
; letters to foreign countries.
PATIOTIaM the keynote to
the stability "of the United States,
has been adopted as a regular
study in the schools of Cochise
county at the direction of Miss El
sie Toles, county superintendent
of schools. The following letter
has been sent out by Miss Toles
to the teachers of various sclfUols
in the county:
"The crisis facing our country
today has aroused a npMonal ex
pression of patriotism. Us in
spiration means both o oppor
tunity and responsibility to the
scho'Jls in their business of mak
ing citizens. What is being done
in yours to impress upon the chil
dren lessons of sincere and earn?
est patriotism the kind that is
as much the possession of the
every day citizen as of the sold
ier? Probably some patriotic ex
ercise is a regular part of your
program.
"If not, n'j time 1 better than
now to begin. The salute to the
flag which should be flying
throughout the day, before me
school, should be given at least
once or twice a week better still,
every day, if you are careful not
to make it-niere routine, but a sim
ple and impre&sive ceremony. Be
sure that no child, ro matter what
bis or her nationality, evades it.
"The children may repeat one
day the pledge of allegiance, an
other, recite a verse rrvin Nea
bit's 'Your Flag and My Flag,' or
sing 'America.' It is a reproach
to us that few Ameiicans con sing
this through entirely from mem
ory. It would be a fine and inspir
ing anthem a.s he salutes the
flag. It the pupils of your school
did so just once, it would be a
revelation to you and. the children
of tae song's power and inspira
tion. Asks For Suggestions
"You are projaoly planning
closing day exercises and, espe
cially if your school is isolated,
are conironted witu the question
of obtaining material. tiy not
make your linai program a pat
riotic oue, composed ot simply told
clones of American heroes, 'Am
erica,' sung by the entire school,
the Gettysburg address, patriotic
recitauVnis and tiie flag salute at
the end?
"It you have worked out a dif
ferent plan, but with the same
idea benind it, we should be glad
to. hove you send it in. so we may.
pass your good ideas on to the
other teachers..
"These suggestions are offered
you in the hope that they will
help yiu in instilling into the child
reverence lV)r the flag and respect
for all that it represents."

RAiNBOW PRINCESS
i AT CENTRAL TONIGHT
I One of the most decided hits made
on Broadway this season was the
Hula Hula dance which Ann Penning
ton contributes to the "Ziegfeld Fol
lies." This picturesque Hawaiian
' dance has been incorporated in the
, Famous Players-Paramount picture
, "The Rainbow Princess" in which
Miss Pennington is starred,
j In order to make the scene as real
, isticTas possible, a Hawaiian village'
'. was e rec ted as a background for the
: dance and the celebrated Hawaiian
' orchestra which accompanies Miss
Pennington on the stage was engaged
to play for her during the filming of
the dance for the screen. The mere
fact that this is the most expensive
Hawaiian orchestra in this country
did not deter V.ic producers from u.
iug the musicians, because it was fel.
that Miss Pennington would be man
at home with the same r.c;oinp;.n
( merit she had had all season.

printed in the Review calling on
the. young men and women of the
Warren District to do what th.-y
couid to stir up a few marriages,
as not a single ceremony tiau
been performed in this city for
several weeks. Yesterday the
clerk of the superior coutt at
Tombstone issued four marriage
licenses and local justices of the
peace sent in applications lor sev
eral more, which will probably be
issued today. The Review docs
not claim to be a local agent for
Can Cupid & Co.. but it does ad
mit (modestly, of course) that It
is peculiar that four marriage
licenses should be issued imme
diately after it started its cam
paign to end the marriage fam
ine. Anyway, marriages are again
becoming frequent and it is hop
ed that the frequency will in
crease. Fireman Takes Bride

first to take out a marriage li

night at the home of the brid 's

T. R. PLEADS FOR
RIGHT TO RAISE
ARMY DIVISION
ays No Unwise Precedent Will
Be Established In Letting
Him Do So. Wants Quick
Action. " '
(By Review Leased Wire)
NEW YORK. April 5. Colonel The
odore Roosevelt issued a statement
here tonight in which he denied that
"unwise precedent" would be created
as has been suggested in. permitting
him to raise a division for active ser
vice on the French front.
"The American people," asserted
Colonel Roosevelt, "are. united behind
; the President in the determination to
wage effective, aggressive war for our
rights and for the rights of humanity
and civilization. I believe that our
people now realize that the system of
universal military service is the only
effective and the only absolutely dem
ocratic system. I most earnestly
hope for the passage of legislation es
tablishing the principle of universal
obligatory, military service and train
ing. "I believe the American people de
sire that in the immediate future we
send abroad an expeditionary force.
It is an excellent and indispensiblc
thing to raise men and to furnish sup
plies for our allies.
"The American people wish to do
their own fighting. They do not
wish merely to pay others to fight for
them. They believe that we owe it to
ourselves and to the national honor
to send a fighliilg force of at least an
army corps, under the American flag
; to the front at the earliest moment.
This army corps should be command
I ed by one of our first class regular
uajor generals. It might consist of
Jthree, or perhaps only two divisions.
"I have asked permission to raise
a division which would be in this ar
my corps and under its commander.
"JJnIo unwise precedent can possibly e
created by permitting an ex-president
of the United States of previous mili
fary experience to raise such a divi
sion and to serve with it at the front,
under the command of the general
who heads the army corps."

DRAMA
VNGENT SERRANO AT
ROYAL THEATRE TODAY
"A Modern Mon!e Ciirfto," featur
ing Yinccitf Serrano .will be shown
this afternoon and tonight at the Roy
al theatre. The story of the film,
produced by Thanhouser, follows:
At Doctor Emerson's farewell bach
elor dinner the conversation veered
to the struggles in the medical world
to achieve success unless a doctor
was unscrupulous. "Tomorrow," he
said, "I operate on a rich old man.
One of his relatives offered me $20.
"00 if he dies." I would have him ar
rested only it would be his word
ngain.-t mine."
Hitting on a scheme the rejected
Hval by his t ide plies him "with wine,
thus shattering his nerves and caus
ing failure of the operation the next
lay. Accused by the police and for
saken by his false friend he escapes
on the way to prison and is reported
drowned.
Years passed and the rival marriee
to Emerson's former fiPrteee had be
come a successful but unscrtipulour
ship oner. One day he visited one
of his hhips with his little daughter,
who mad? friends with a silent sailor
A few days later the child mysterious
ly disappeared.
Weeks, months, passed and one day
an aviator on a cross ocean trip
brouyht tlie child to her father with
a note tif ked in her dress. "She Km
been saved by yeur bitterest ent-my.
Beware! Siime day lie will strike
through her." Then, she told her dad
dy of f'e trip on one of bis own boats
the wreck, her rescue by the sailor
"doc tor man" and the life on the ties
ert island where she was picked ui
and he realized with terror who hi:
enemy was. Years of dread follower
and just as a report of the other-;
death reached him his day of judge
