State Engineer Is
Opposed to National
Highway Aid Under
Townsend Measure
PHOENIX, Ariz., Nov. 22. State
Engineer Maddock today addressed a
letter to Harry Welch of this city,
member of the federal highway coun
cil, in opposition to the Townsend
hill relating to constructing of a
national highway system. Six rea
sons were cited by the state engineer!
why he said the state should disap j
prove tne measure.
His first objection was that thei
proposed appropriation of $425,
000,000 was not over 15 per cent of
the amount necessary for carrying
out tho program. The amount appro
priated for the first two years would
not even suffice for the government
ll KJ L CIC
to take over the road8 already con.
structed by states and counties on
the routes contemplated if the right
of way costs were included as the
bill provided.
For a second reason Maddock
pointed out that no provision was
made to secure for Arizona any spe
cific benefits, although Arizona's
proportionate tax contributions would
be certain. There was no certainty
he said, of Arizona getting anything
out of the first $425,000,000.

PEACE TREAT!
CON
STANDS STILL
Legislators Leave For Homes
i and White House Gossip
Hushed to Await Next
Session On Dec. 1
WASHINGTON, Nov. 22. The
peace treaty controversy apparently
entered tonight upon a week of wait
ing, while sentiment crystalizes for a
compromise or for a finish fight in
the 1920 political campaign.
Most of the few senators who re
mained here afterjlhe closing of the
session, left for hojneduring the day,
and there was no indication at the
White House that the president had
changed his decision to let treaty is
sues stand where they are until he
sends his message to! the new session
of congress a week from Monday:
Senator Hitchcock of Nebraska, the
administration leader in the treaty
fight, issued a statement today be
fore starting home, reiterating his be
lief that ratification yet would be ac
complished. He said, however, that
reservations were "inevitable.
The stand in favor of carrying the
reservation fight into the campaign,
outlined last night in a statement by
Republican Leader Lodge, was de
clared by Mr. Hitchcock to have been
actuated more by politics than by
patriotism.
The only word from the White
House during the day was a state
ment by Secretary Tumulty saying
that the president was in thorough
accord with Senator Hitchcock's
management of the fight for ratifica
tion and was taking no part in the
choice of a Democrataic senate leader
to succeed the late Senator Martin.
The statement was directed against
published reports that Senator Under
wood of Alabama ".would have Mr.
Wilson's backing for the leadership.
In the coming week many senators
on both sides are expected to feel out
sentiment in their home -states.

Plan to Fix Price
On Sugar Mistake,
Says the Chairman
NEW YORK. Nov. 22. The gov
ernment's announced intention of
fixing a flat general nrice of 12 cents
a pound for sugar was criticized to
day by Geo. A. Zabriski, chairman of
the sugar equalization board, who
said that without such action a re
duction in the price of sugar might
be expected. . 1
The establishment of a flat rate,
he said, would operate as an auto
matic minimum to raide the price of
all beet sugar produced in this coun
try, most of which can be manufac
tured on a 10 Vz or even a 10 cent
basis. Cuban producers, he added,
would be inspired under the fixed
12 cent rate to hold their entire out
put for that price.
Mr. Zabrlskie expressed the belier
that the sugar shortage in various
parts or. the country is only tempo
rary and will soon be remedied. He
said it was his opinion that it is too
late for any effective governmental
control of the sugar industry.

TRAIN BANDIT
CHEYENNE, Wyo., Nov. 22. The
secret service department of the
Union Pacific railroad here tonight
announced it was "marking time,"
waiting for definite word from Wm. L.

Pigs-Not Humans-Plain Pigs
Caused War, Declares Austrian
WASHINGTON. Nov. 22. Pigs just pigs brought on the war.
according to a statement accredited to Count Karl Seilern, formerly
confidential adviser to the erstwhile Emperor Charles at Vienna.
Frederick H. Mead, of Troy, N. Y., a member of the Red Cross convoy
taking food supplies to Budapest, reports the count as saying:
"Fifteen years before the war, Serbia was shipping great num
bers of pigs into Hungary, successfully competing with the Hungarian
farmers. The Hungarians protested but the border was left open.
Finally the Austro-Hungarian government, on the pretext that all
Serbian pigs were diseased, placed an embargo on them.
"Political leaders In Serbia seized upon the pig incident. Mis
understandings grew over It. When it grew too told for political

STANDING ARMY
OF 260,000 IS
1ARGR REPORT
Chief of Staff Says Smaller
Army and Universal Train
ing All That Is Neces
sary to Be Prepared I
WASHINGTON, Nov. 22. A stand
ing army of about 260,000 men. back
ed by a universal military training
system to supply reserves, would
meet the peace time requirements of
the United States, General Peyton C.
March, chief or starr, declared in his
annual report, made public today and
which probably forecasts recommen
dations to be made by the war de
partment when congress reconvenes.
General March founded his judg
ment on lessons of the world war.
That proved conclusively, he said,
that ability to be self sustaining for
an indefinite period, provided the
army was adequately prepared, was
the nation's greatest military asset.
So far as purely naval operations
are concerned, he added, the United
States has nothing to fear "from any
conceivable combination" of naval
powers; but must be prepared to pre
vent seizure of bases by an enemy
controlling the sea and intent on
landing troops.
"Wiihout the possession of such
bases in France," the report said, "we
could not have landed our army, irre
spective ot the tact that the aines wad
control or the sea."
General March recommennea nxtng
the sertngth or the regular army at
ttve army corps, maintained at halt
strength in peace times. The pro
posals ot the department, presented,
tentatively to congress during the
special session, called for 509,000 men
and the statement of the thief of
staff wm taken to indirate that this
would be scaled down to L'tiO.OOO.
The report defended teh present
staff system with authority central
ized in the chief of staff. Proof of its
efficiency could be found, it said, in
the fact that the United States had
sent more than 2.000.000 men and
vast supplies overseas, ihus necomlng
"a positive factor in the military ac
tions of the war."
"I am convinced." General March
said, "that without a properly organ
ized and efficient general staff, with
authority to formulate and execute
the army program, it will in future
wars, as in this and every other war
of our history, be impossible for the
activities of the various agencies.
services and bureaus of tne war de
partment to be controlled anu direct
ed to the attainment of the common
end."
"Under the terms of the irvaty of
peace," General March added, "the
German general staff was abolished.
Had the Germans won the war they
would in all probability prescribed
somewhat similar 'terms for the
United States."
The war produced new practices,
but not new principles, and "was not
won. as some predicted, by a new and
terrible development of modern
science," but "by men, munitions and
morale."
The American military achievement
was possible "only because of the as
sistance of our allies," General March
said, and in urging an adequate mili
tary policy, added:
"Surely we can never expect to
prepare for defense against the at
tack of a powerful and determined
agency again under such favorable
conditions to ourselves."

$10O MINIMUM SALARY
FOR TEACHERS ADVOCATED
PHOENIX, Nov. . 22. Facing an
alorming shortage of school teachers,
C. O. Case, state superintendent of
public instruction has advocated i
minimum wage of $100 per month for
the entire year .for all Instructors.
This increase he believes will mate
rially assist in securing addtional
applications for the December exam
inations soon to be held.
Although several schools in various
parts of the state are now closed com
pelling children to journey long dis
tances to other school houses and
causing considerable consestion. Su
perintendent Case asserts that the
situation will be even more acute fol
lowing the coming examinations.
To overcome the shortage at the
begnning of the last semester tempo
rary certificates were issued to many
teachers. Some of these failed to
qqalify in subsequent examinations
and it is thought that others will not
take the December examnation ow
ing to their apparent reluctancy to
serve under present wage condi
tions. Superintendent Case also attributes
the scarcity of teachers to the tempt
ing salaries being offered by many
business concerns to those possess
ing the educational qualities neces
sary to pass the state examination.
He would (overcome this competition
by granting salary increases.
(Fifteen vacancies exist at present
throughout the state. Six of these
are 'in Cochise county while others
are widely scattered throughout the
rural sections.

That th?re is a bieger stork of re-1
fined copper on hand at present than '
the world has ever seen before, and j
that conditions in the copper industry j
are in a e.eneral way "distinctly bad" .
with no apparent relief in slslit, were1
statements made yesterday by Yal-'
ter Douslas, president, of t!:e Phelps j
Dodge corporation, who vus in His- j

-Tbo outlook for the r.cxt few .
mon:hs in the copper industry is j
vcy, very dark," said Mr. Douglas.
"The pi ice has gone down to between '
IX and 19 cents, with a bigger sick
of refined copper on hand than the :
worid has ever seen before. !
"The copper industry lias depended
f;ir 50 per cent of consumption on the
export trade, which is now practically
de:d, finnnciut Ktrinpeney and the
drop in exchange r.nlvir.g it impos-1
ruble to export at all." " i
The iic!;;y i;i ra:if!catk.n of ine

equilibrium.
"If we could 'foresee
responsible for
the industrial
in any way
what the. politicians are going to ilo-:
witli the peace treaty, we could tell
when conditions in the coprer indus- !
try will he bel:?red,' said Mr. Dous
las.' "Personally, the action of the
s nate in regard to the treaty matter
does noL' seem intelligent." !
Thee is no doubt of the tronien- ;
dous demand for copper on tne part '
or die central powers, ;ind thr.t they ;
will be in the market for tho octal
when peace is concluded, according
to Mr. Douglas. Tho problem, how
c'(-r, he points out, is a question of
whether tho central powers will be
ablr to pay, and how they will pay.
'There are certainly no encourag
ing indications in the copper situa
tion at present," added Mr. Doug'ars.
"However, conditions clianerc ra; idly,
so it is hard to tell just what the future-may
hold.".' 1
; - wave of extravagance Is sweep
ing over the nation, Mr. Dougl.is said,,
which must be suppressed before in
dustrial conditions pet back to nor-j
mad. I
That the apparent outbreak of rad-'
icalism and I. W. W.ism is merely j
the recrudescence of long-existent
traitorous elements which have been j
' seeking the overthrow of the Amerl-
can constitution and the American in
stitutions which spring from It, !3 the
belief of Mr. Douglas. Tho forces of
decency and good ci .izenshlp and the
forces striving to tear down decency
and good citizenship, have now been
b"ouyht into sharp alignment, which
should have a hem fichil result in
forcing the issue and causing tho
overthrow of tht disloyal forces. The
anti-radical campaign started by the
American lesion, now assisted by the
Tinted Americans, will be conclusive,
Mr. Dmtrlas believes.
Mr. Douglas stated tlii'.t l!t resolu
tion which he introduced at. tho re
cent national mining eer sirens !n Si.
Louis, regarding th- situation in Mex
ieo. was a general resolution asking
the state department to take cogniz
ance of ih.e great loss of life in he
mining profession in Mexico in the
last few years, causing great injury
to the mining industry. TVe resolu
tion pointed ou that fOTgn enter
prise in Me-ico consists largelv in
mining, and that less of life through
bar.dityy has constituted a great
drawback this enterprise.
The resolution was in all particu
lars friendly to the nresent Mexican
government, containing no sentiment
wljich might in any way be construed
as expressive of hostility to that gov
ernment. Its nurpose was principally
to mil to the attention of the Mexican
government the desire for protection
of American mining engineers, own
tovg pnd prospectors in (he southern
renublie.
Mr. Douglas was unabie to attend
the St. Louis congress, .so his resolu
tion was not piesenied in person.
There is but little new in the cop
per situation in the southwest so far
as :h.- Phelrs Dodge prcpt J tie?- are

N. M.. and Morenci, Arizona, are

extensive campaign of development
work in place of production. Thy
mines of the Phelps Dtxige in Mexico
arc now 'running 'abotit half their ca
pacity. Here in the Warren district
the mines are now running at about
two-thirds capacity.
Necessity for consolidation is the
reason for moving the law offices of
the Phelps Dodge corporation, and
lh2 offices of Gerald Sherman, gen
eral tvining director, from Eisbee to
Douglas, according to Mr. Douglas.
The change, he stated, will be made
soon after the first of the year. No

Remarkable and growing success
for the Cochise Building and Loan
association is shown in a recent re
port of that organizatfon, which
serves the double purpose of helping
to build up homes m the Warren dis
trict while acting as a means of sav
ing to employes of the mining com
panies and assisting them to become
property owners with comfortable
bank balances substantial and per
manent citizens of the community.
The loan association, in which the
mining companies and the Warren
company take a lively interest, has
as stockholders a great number of
the merchants, business men and
miners of the district. Its affairs
are handled by a board of nine direc
tors elected each year from among
the stockholders. The association
Las now been doing business for 12
years and has no real estate on hand.
Delinquency of stockholders rarely
totals $300 in any one month. j
There have been only one or two
changes in the board of directors of
the association since iis organiza
tion 12 yearn ago. The originator and
promote:- of the Cochise Building and
L.or.n association was Prof. James S. :
Douglas. It was he who suggested
the scheme, and at his request it was
started. The association has made '
loans aggregating close to a million j
dollars to employes of the mining I
companies, and has proven a great
success to all concerned. It has as
sisted in building up the district with
good homes and has been the means
of a great saving to those who bor
rowed. - The board of directors who have
acted Pll these years are Gerald
Sherman, president; J. E. Curry, vice
president; M. J. Cunningham, -secre-turv
nnd treasurer: L. C. Shattuck,
C. S. Thompson, B. L. Smith, A. T. j

their lime and care has been given

the benefit.

tries consist of the 50 yard swim,
any stroke; 30 yard, backhand swim;
CO yard breast race, five dives with
the best average, and the longest
dive, standing position and no stroke.
The afternoon events will prove
interesting to the representative
teams from the high schools of the
state. At 2 o'clock all teams entered
for the indoor baseball meet will
play. At 3 o'clock, the basketball
title will be settled, and at 4 o'clock,
the last event, the soccer games will

have been allotted to these group
contests and each winning team will
take home the bacon. The Phoenix
boys say they are out to meet all
comers in any or all of these above
events.
Great preparations are being made
by Earl C. Reeves, boys' work direc
tor of the Y at Phoenix, to entertain
the visiting delegates. Reeves says
further, "The girls of Phoenix are
more excited about the coming con

.An announcement of interest to all
the fistic fans of the Warren dis
trict, and especially to the few who
saw his fight with Walter Caldwell
at the Grand theater on Friday even
ing, was made yesterday by Fred D.
George, who wil be known as "Kid
George" no longer, who gave notice
that he had become manager orj
Caldwell, the husky New Mexican
who defeated him in ten o fthe fast
est rounds ever staged by the Bisbee
Athletic club.
George and Caldwell came to terms
yesterday, when the new partnership
went into effect. George will start
immediately to place Caldwell in
some main event in Arizona, and un
til this is done" he and Caldwell will
remain in Bisbee. Burlin Caldwell,
brother to the boxer, returned yester
day to Springer, N. M.
"I believe that in Caldwell I have
a real find," George said yesterday.
"He is young and fast, a man of
clean life who knows the game, hits
haiJ and has all the courage in the'
world. He is getting better with!
every fight, and with more experi
ence and good handling he should
develop into one o fthe best men in!
the ring today."
Caldwell has a sore hand, due to
his fight Friday night, but in every
other way shows no ill effects of the
battle. He likes Bisbee and the man
ner in which he has been treated
here, . and said yesterday that he
welcomed the chance to stay here.
here shortly after the Thanksgiving
football game and will spend the
night in Tucson. Robert A. Russell,
boys' work secretary of the Tucson
association, has kindly consented to
let the Bisbee boys use the Y gym
to sleep in but the boys must furnish
their own blankets. The Bisbee boys
appreciate Mr. Russell's kindness and
will take advantage of his offer by
holding a "slumber party" in the
gym. Those delegates who attended
last year's conference know that a
great deal of fun can be had at one of
these parties, as the idea is for each
boy to see how much slumber he can
keep the other fellows from getting.
The V. V. V. club of the Y. M. C. A.
has announced that it will send two
members to the boys' conference It
is expected the other clubs will soon
announce their quota of delegates.

The colonel, who was commander
of the famous "Battle of Death," is

story to tell. He is a modest man
and says as little about himself as
possible. He tells the story of the

"1 have taken a good many differ
ent medicines, but Tanlac is the only
one that ever did me any good," said
Mrs. Elizabeth Anderson, who lives at
534 Hyde St., San Francisco, Cal., to
a Tanlac representative a few days
ago.
"For five years I suffered with
nervous indigestion," continued Mrs.
Anderson, "and had a very poor appe-
i tite, and what little I did manage to
! force down would sour on my stomach
nd gas would form and press up
ugainst my heart to that it would pal
pitate dreadfully, and I could hardly
breathe. My nerves were In very bad
! condition and I would lie awake at
night for hours at a time, as I just
couldn't go to sleep.
"Finally I got some Tanlac and be
gan taking it, as I had read so much
in the papers about the good it was
doing others. To my surprise I be
gan to improve after the first few
doses, and now since I have taken
five bottles of this medicine I am like
a different woman. I am not bother
ed with indigestion any more, my ap
petite is good and I tan eat anything
I want and everything I eat agrees
with me perfectly. I do not suffer
with palpitation or shortness of
breath and my nerves are in good
condition and I sleep simply fine and
Ket up in the morning feeling rested
and refreshed. Tanlac is a wonderful
medicin and I tell all my friends about
it every time I get an opportunity."

private who won the war," is the
way he puts it. f
No one can ' listen to this story of
the war as he tells it without appre
ciating as never before what the men
went through who left their midst to
go fight for the cause of freedom
and world democracy. He shows the
life of the soldier in all its phases,
in the rest camp, down under the
ground in the difgouts, out in the
trenches, over the top, in the en
emy's wire entanglements, into their
trenches, the night raids, the hand-to-hand
encounterit is a great pan
amoric word picture so vivid as to
make his hearers follow him step by
step, forgetting iali -but the scene he
paints. It is one of the greatest
war stories that has ever been given
the American public.
This man's story is not a second
hand affair, but is told by a master
orator who led his men in the thick
of it and shared their fortunes
through it all. He was wounded
twice while leading his men, and he
is still suffering -from shell shock,
yet he declares yiat all the heroes
were found in the ranks except a
few lieutenants and now and then a
captain, but never getting above
that.
The colonel speaks for one hour
and fifteen minutes. The first hour
is given entirely to the story of the
war, and the last fifteen minutes in
showing the similarity between the

CO-OPERATIVE 20TH CENTURY
STORE CAUSING i CLUB HEN
IDE INTEREST! TO STUDY LI
The interest being taken in the co
operative store movement continues
to increase among the people of the
Warren district, all of whom are in
terested in solving the problem of
the high cost of living. Tentative
plans adopted are as follows:
Share3 will be sold at $5 each,
with a membership fee of $2 in addi
tion for organization purposes. The
minimal number of shares entitling
one lo ell privileges of membership
is f i : . ;.nd the , maximum number
that one person may purchase is
100.
The organization will be strictly
democratic, each member will have
but one vote in all matters coming
before the membership meetings and
no voting by proxy will be flowed.
The store will be a branch of the
Facific Co-operative League, whose
headquarters are in San Francisco.
The manager will be a nexperienced
man selected by the central office
and the business will be conducted
under its supervision, in conjunction
with a board of directors elected by
the members of the local'store. This
arrangement . protects the local
branch from the pitfalls which have
caused the failure of some co-operative
movements in the past.
Shares will draw 5 per cent per
annum interest, and profits which
accumulate will be distributed to
members according to the amount of
purchases.
All funds will be deposited in the
Miners' and Merchants' bank and
will be held by the bank in escrow
until the minimum of $15,000 is paid
in before any steps will be taken to
open for business.
t is oxpeeted that the membership
will take some action at the meeting
to be held today in regard to the se
lection of a location for the tsore and
that plans may be made for opening
for business some time next month.
Membership is open to the public
and everyone interested in the high
cost of living is invited to join in the
organization.

THE DIAMOND GRID
Twelve years' ago, the Philadelphia Storage Bat
'tery Company set out to build a really good battery.
We knew that a truly good battery plate should
not buckle nor lose its active material.
We knew that a truly good separator should give
perfect insulation combined with perfect conductivity.
We knew that good plates plus good separators
would make a good battery.
Every battery user knows that he pays most of
his repair bills because his battery plates or his battery
separators have broken down in service. Stronger
plates and stronger separators mean longer battery life.
Consider first the plates. Battery plates are com
posed of lead and lead oxides, which, immersed in the
.sulphuric acid solution and charged, are capable of giv
ing forth electric current. They consist of two parts:
1. A "grid" or framework of hard, antimonious
lead. The grid gives the plate its strength. 2. Sup
ported by this grid is the "active material." The ac
tive material givs the plate its capacity to "store"
and give forth electric current; All battery plates are
subject to severe, internal strain, caused by the chemi
cal changes occurring in their active material. Unless
they are strong enough to stand that strain, they
"buckle" or warp, and they shed the active material.
Now the ordinary battery grid i3 braced in two
directions only vertically and horizontally. It is not
braced at an angle. The ordinary grid is not built in
accordance with the fundamental ' engineering princi
ple the Diamond for strength. '
But the Philadelphia Diamond Grid IS basi-d on lit in funda
mental principle. Like all stions; things, il is braced at an anelo.
No matter which way Iln- strain niav conic, there is a brace
to withstand it. It i.? built on precisely tluj same plan as the
biidse, or a lighting ina.st, or a derrick. As a consequence Dia
nmnd Grid plates air free from the buckling and warping thai
caue 75' ' aU b2Mry trouble.

ASSAYERS MEET
On Friday, Nov.- 21, In the evening,
the chemists and assayers of the dis
trict were the guests of the Copper
Queen Chemical club at the Warren
District Country club, and a five
course dinner was served. Mr. Claude
H. Compton, chief chemist of the
Phelps Dodge corporation's Copper
Queen Branch, presided, and after
stating the purpose of the club he
introduced Mr. Charles G. Wood,
chemist for the same corporation,
who gave a very interesting paper
cn the softening of the hard water
of the district for boiler purposes.
After the paper a technical discussion
followed, and an excellent opportu
nity was afforded the chemists to ex
change ideas.
Those present were as follows:
Claude H. Compton, E. Broughton, L.
Feuchere, Charles G. - Wood, Dr.
Black, B. A. McNally, Wm. Brostrom,
L. Dupen, H. Whaley, H. F. Yoder,

The distinguished service crci
thecroix de guerre, the British mill
tary cross, of these and still other
decorations for conspicuous heroism
we have heard mueh during the past
year. And one -of the most out
standing features in these accounts
of gallantry and daring is the large
number of chaplains who have been
thus singled out for special recog
nition bv the military authorities of
the allied nations. I
Probably it i6 hardly realized in t
any quarter how many .there were
who went to France wearing only the
silver cross as the insignia of office
of the army chaplain, but who came
back wearing also another cross, the
recognition of display of courage or
deeds of heroism. The records of
the war department shaw that twenty-two
chaplains have received the
distinguished service cross of the
United States. No fewer than a
score have been awarded the croix
de guerre and it is probable that
the total is nearer twice that num
ber, as many of these citations have
come directly from the French army
and are not yet publicly known. At
least two have received the British
military cross, one the Belgian war
cross and two have been designated
for the legion of honor. A single
chaplain of the twenty-seven divisions
was decoated by three governments
and cited seven times for conspicu
ous valor. Nor is thit all. Many
others have received ' citations, on
I TTTBI WnVYTTlTii
whom no special decoration has been
conferred. And, finally, the highest
military honor in the power of our
government, an award of the dis
tinguished service medal "for excep
tionally meritorious and distinguished
service," has been bestowed upon
four of these "knights of the silver
cross."

George W. Long of Phoenix, presi
dent of the Feather River Copper
company, the property of which is lo
cated in Lumas county, northern Cal
ifornia, who is one of the best known
mining men in Arizona, arrived in
Bisbee two days ago and Is staying
at the Copper Queen hotel. Mr. Long
is also president of the "Kay" Copper
company and vice president of the
United Eastern company, Oatman,
which has developed one or the
largest ore deposits in the west and
which has been a bonanza to its
stockholders, having paid 7 cents a
share a month for more than two
years.
The Feather River mine, according
lo a report shown by Mr. Long yes
terday which was drawn up on the
.first of the month, has a tunnel in
for 250 feet, and this is being driven
at a rate of eight feet a day. It will
cut the first big showing of ore by
Jan. 1, it is believed, provided that
the present speed of progress con
tinues. On the same hill wmcn is
being cut by the Feather River tun
nel is located the famous Engle mine,
which is cutting the same formation
and breaks which extend into the
property of the Feather River.
With regard to the Kay property,
Mr. Long said that more than 6,000,
000 tons of 6 per cent copper ore have
been located, and two additional ore
lenses have been opened up by dia
mond drills. The company has just
contracted for a 1000-feet, three-compartment

'ROUND AND 'ROUND SHE GOES, WHERE SHE STOPS NOBODY KNOWS!
The Wheel of fortune is revolving in the great Oil Lease Lottery with the same mathematical precision as
in the old days of the Louisiana State Lottery a decade ago.
As in the days of the Louisiana Lottery, which to most of us has become a memory pleasure or other
wise according to our experience there are capital prizes in the shape of Gushers and the blanks as symbol
ized by dry holes.
The. Louisiana Lottery, legislated out of existence by an unlightened generation, came to grief because of
the insatiable greed of Howard and his confrers. But with its passing there came another form of lottery
a game of chance in the oil game a legitimate lottery if you please where there is no "rake-off," no Kitty,
and where every man has an equal chance.
The buying of a lease out in front of production is lottery pure and simple. If the oil is there maybe
your fortune is made; if it is not, ypur investment may be gone.
, But this is the chance you take!
Northern Louisiana is in the throes of a wild oil boom. Homer and Bull Baypu are making fortunes for
the lucky ones. Leases are changing hands at advancing prices daily. The country is swarming with inves
tors, big and little, from the four comers of the globe. Money in Shreveport is as free as in the old days of
Cripple Creek. The banks are "bulging with it and nowhere, in America is money turned over faster.
We will sell you an oil lease of from 8 to 1 0,000 acres, as you wish. This lease is like' a deed to your
house in that it is yours. You can sell it or hold it at will. If oil is found near you, the lease may prove a
fortune. Others are making big money' buying and selling leases why not you? Break the shackles. Take a
chance.
Suppose you should lose your money. It is not your life!
We promise nothing Guarantee Nothing only a square deal a legitimate run for your money that's
all.
We have leases as low as $2.50 per acre. These are out in advance of production and still unproved,
though promising. We also have leases at $5.00, $10.00, $15.00, $25.00 and $100.00 per acre and upwards,
and as high as $20,000 per acre off-set Gusher leases. The price is governed entirely by proximity to produc
ing wells.
Send your check or money order today. Tell us how much you desire to pay per acre and we will se
lect a lease, for you with the same care and scrutiny as if we were choosing for ourselves.
Our aim is to build up a large and prosperous clientele. Your success is our success. We deliver
promptly any lease we sell. Our references, any bank in Shreveport.
Let us sell you a lease today. It may be your Capital Prize. Make all checks to the order of

And. so it comes clear that ex;

they call happiness which does not

their own estimation) if there is not
bubbling inside them a caldron of
exhilaratey gayety.
When life is simply calm and
pleasant, when days pass by smooth

and accustomed affections, it is rare
for the young to recognize that just
that and nothing more is worthy the
name of joy.
Perhaps nothing but. the experience
of years brings anybody to wa per
sonal realization of the . joy that
runs with the unexcited current of
ordinary living when love, faith and
good cheer go with it.
But young people ought to heed
the counsel of their elders which
tells them this, especially when they

is the culminating word which marks
the1 'crown of their courage and re
veals the quality of their sacred de
termination. How would the spirit
of these men find expression in our
own time?
Here is a, familiar word of counsel
which has become part of our pro
verbial lore. Honesty is the best
policy! Wha has not heard the
maxim 7 And who has not received
the teaching? The young novice in
business is told by such counsellors
that in the long run trickery eats
away its own strength. Honorable
dealings will multiply your clients.
Honest advertising will bring youi
customers crowding to your doors
So be honest. Weave honesty into
your fabrics. Work it into your
threads and Into your webs. Stamp
honesty upon your products. Infuse
it into your enterprise. . That is the
secret of success. As a mere mat
ter of policy honesty is the best
road to take!
Well, then, if that be so, the young
business man's (course is simple and
clear. Let him take the fine scales
of moral scrupulousness into all the
relations of his business life. Let
him carry into every concern the
most sensitive conscience and let
him watch the exquisite balance with
sleepless vigilance. Let him stamp'
everything with the seal of honor.
Let him reverence his conscience as
his king. And business will fly as
doves to. his windows!
Yes, "but if not" how then? Sup
pose that honesty may lead to the
fiery furnace of disastrous experi
ence, how then? Suppose that hon
esty is not. always the best policy
for making and acquiring wealth.
Suppose that the best policy, that is,
the most successful policy, may
sometimes be found by adding a lit
tle alloy to the pure gold so as to
make it durable and usable in the
rough and tumble of common life
ing treasures of the world. j
If we are to be among those who
will do right" whatever the issues i
may be, who will be honest, and j
true, and dutiful, even though it ;
mean a fiery furnace, our souls will !
have to be strengthened for that j
testing road. And what shall we :
need? First of all we shall require1
a true sense of life's values. Wei
shall have to hold the conviction j
that the treasures of the soul are
infinitely more precious than the
prizes of the world, that moral and
spiritual possessions infinitely trans
cend material wealth and social hon
or. The other thing we need is l he
assurance that we can possess and
enjoy the fellowship of the Son of
God even in the fiery furnace.. That
is life's great secret and that is life's
crowning glory. In all the centuries
men have walked with Christ, end
have refused the lures of the tempt
ing road. They have been content
ed to be deserted by the world if
only they were attended by him.

It would require a train of thirty
cars to deliver all the Bibles that

act figures are: United States, 371,-j
724; Canada, 26,777; making a total1
of 398,501.. It is estimated that
there are 2,000,000 hotel rooms in

sentiment to men fresh from France, i
tuc i i r t i rr u, uitc Drteece
and it is wholly possible to use too;
many phrases about the.r fellows
who are not returning with them. '
But that does not arise fiom lack;
of sentiment of the right cort among
them. Rather, it comes from feeling
that worthy things are hard to .say.
The largest danger is not from It o
much sentime but from "loo little.
There has been a grimnesd about the
overseas task that may readily
merge iato American grimness in
getting a fresh start.
No one ought to wish nor be al
lowed to forget the little, whit 3
crosses that mark the fields of
France. After the way they were
spread over with acreas," sometime
one alone, then a few, then large
numbers but all marked with small
white crosses. They constituted one
of the -mpst families and touching
sights of a viey of the" battle lines.
Most men were buried where they
fell. Since then details of their liv
ing comrades have. been working to
concentrate the graves in special
burial areas. Now our honored dead
find much closer fellowship in the
soil of France. But still in the
closely plotted cemeteries as on the
open battlefields the white cross
marks' eaci "sleeping hero's bed.
The meaning of this symbolism
must not escape us. These little
white crosses " are a testimony to a
great faith. , It may not have been
the personal faith of the men over
whose graves they rise but it moved
the great forces that brought them
there and it glorified their heroism
when they fell. It is a cross that
makes death endurable. It chaiges
the grave from a chasm iuto which
life falls to a channel through which
life flows. It points upward when
the heart f-.ces downward. Riding
across the fields of battle, the desol
ation seems almost unbearable; trees
are shredded out of shape, hillocks
are cast up and hollows gashed out,
rusted wire 6tretches away intermin
ably; everything speaks to death.
Then the eye falls on the little white
crosses, and there comes a lemonder
of life that was given in the midst
of all this, and a challenge to the
hope which holds death to be not
ruin but triumph. The cross is the
symbol of a victory over defeat, the
assurance of v. settled faith.
These little rhite crosses are als.i
a challenge to a .Treat service. Tiioy
are costly bits f wood f.ni they
stand to shame any men who.ie fel
lows lie underneath if they fail the
great cause for which these gave so
much. "If ye fail, we shall not
sleep, though poppies grow in Flan
ders fields." But it is not they who
may not sleep; it is we who fail
whose sleep will be broken with
shame.
Each of these crosses means one
less man who might, be u burden
bearer for the world, giving UP his
long service for the short, fierce
fight that had to be made, but leav
ing his burden to be borne by n en
bravo enough to face the world and

HE MID CHRISTIANITY
"Bolshevism and the Christian religion can not both survive," af
firms the report of the Senate Judiciary Committee on Bolshevism.
An examination of this report, says the Minneapolis Tribune, will con
vince the American Christian that "Russian Bolshevism triumphant in
this country would be followed by the confiscation of 203,432 church
edifices;; by the suppression of all denominational Sunday schools,
seminaries, and colleges; and by atheist dictatorship domination over
41,926,854 church members.. What the Bolshevik government has
done to show its hostility to the Christian religion is thus summar
ized from the Senate report by the Minneapolis paper:
"It has confiscated all church property, real aid personal.
"It has established the right of antireligious propaganda as a con
stitutionally recognized institution.
"It has suppressed Sunday schools and has expressly forbidden
the teaching of religious .doctrines in public, cither in schools or
in educational institutions cf any kind.
"It prohibits religion from being tzught or studied except in
private.
"It has abolished all recognition of a supreme being in govern
mental and judicial oaths.
"It has disfranchised expressly all clergy ?nd servants and em
ployees of church bodies and has deprived them of all right to hold
public positions.' s.
"Under the old imperialistic regime sinner that it was it be
came the practice by both custom and decree., that every., newspaper
and every periodical published Easter Sunday throughout the Russian
Empire carried the commemorative head-line, 'Christ is Risen.'.. On
Easter Sunday of 1918 the Bolshevik publications substituted the
legend:
"'One hundredyears ago today Karl Marx was born.'"

By GEO.
SOUTHWEST DIVISION.
Development work in the South
west Division since January 1, 1919,
has been mainly in the upper levels.
On the 6th 'level, about 300 above
the' bottom of Tombstone Canyon,"
more than 2000 feet of heading has
been driven in developing new ore
bodies and prospecting new country.
On the 7th level, 100 feet higher,
a tunnel has been driven into Queen
Hill from the Hendricks Gulch side.
Crosscuts from this tunnel will con
nect with the raises through the ore
from the level below and will fur
nish waste for filling the stopes as
mining proceeds.
Stoping operations are being car
ried on at present along the regular
edges of the ore body. The ore is
mainly oxide and corbonate replacing
Devonian limestone.
CZAR DIVISION.
Work in the Czar has been con
centrated mainly in three sections,
in the Dividend ore bodies, along
the Dividend fault above the 400
level, near the Czar shaft on the
300, and near the old Queen incline
above th 200 level.
The Dividend stopes are in chaleo
cite ore In porphyry, which Is wet
and very heavy. Mining is carried
on by the top-slicing method, that is,
by renloving a horizontal layer of
ore 8 to 10 feet thick and allowing
or forcing the waste above to cave.
Most of the sections in this coun
try have been mined down to the
200 level.
Near r the Czar shaft on the 300
level several large extensions of the
older ore bodies have been opened
up. Mining is done by the square
set method and extends in some
places through areas mined years
ago. The filling or "old gob" in
these stopes is often rich enough to
be. taken out.
Above the 200 level near the
Queen Incline, one of the --earliest
workings In the district, the stopes

are in carbonate ore. This ore is
often high grade but usually the ore
bodies are very irregular and un
certain. GARDNER DIVISION.
Ii the Spray country stoping is be
ing carried on from the 800 to the
500 level. The ore is entirely
primary sulphide replacing beds in
tbe Abrigo limestone. This ore body
was originally mined by cut-cross
fill methods, but owing to difficulty
in supporting the walls and back
of the stope this method has been
replaced by square-setting. . Connec
tion with the 400 Spray level has
been completed recently for ventila
tion purposes.
Stopes on the 1100 leveL between
the Lowell and Gardner shaft are in
primary sulphide ore in contact brac
cia. Development work on the 1200
below these stopes has greatly in
creased the known tonnage in this
ore body which is being worked to
above the 900 level. Vertical exten
sion -of the ore below the 1200 level
has not been determined through
drifts on the 1300 and 1400 levels
are being driven for this purpose.
On the 1000 Gardner, drifts have
been driven through a large body of
chalcocite ore in porphyry, and cross

NEW INI FIG I TO AID
DEVELOPMENT 0
Hon. Carl Hayden, congressman
from Arizonn, has introduced a bill,
HR10433, to provide for the disposal
of public lands in Arizona, New
Mexico, Nevada and Utah contain
iig copper at depth. The legislation
proposed by the, Hayden bill is. de
signed to meet and deal with a con
dition to which the existing federal
mining laws are not, from the prac
tical standpoint, applicable.
The important copper deposits in
the states mentioned, do not occur
in technical vein or lode formation,
but in extensive low-grade bodies,
usually underlying a heavy overbur
den of wash, conglomerate, or non-mineral-bearing
formation. To dis
cover such underlying deposits deep
and expensive drilling or shaft sink
ing Is necessary, requiring months,
and even years, for its accomplish
ment. Under existing law a discov
ery in such a drill hole or , shaft
could serve to validate, and vest
possessory title to, only one claim,
1500 by 600 feet, or' an area of only
about twenty acres, which is ab
solutely Insufficient, to justify the
great outlay Involved.
In the past the mining communi
ties have attempted to mee the con
ditions by locating claims and doing
assessment work in the overburden
Such claims, in most instances un
supported by any semblance of dis
covery, have been by the communi
ties recognized as property and
bought and sold as 'such, but, gen
erally speaking, the ground has re
mained undeveloped.
In many instances meagre surface
showings, not connected with the
underlying deposits, have been claim
ed as discoveries and even wade
the basis of patent proceedings. In
the early days the land department
did not crithically. examine into the
matter of discovery unless the ques
tion were raised by protest or con
test, and large numbers of such
claims were patented. This was the
case at Bisbee, where the ore forma
tion occurs at a depth of 1000 feet
or more. In later'-years the depart
ment has established the practice of
requiring a detailed showing as to
the character and quality of discov
ery claimed and of making, through
its field service., an investigation on
the ground. . As a result, the depat
ment has been confronted . with the
question as to whether inconsequen
OCTOBER SHOWN
Although Inspiration increased Its
output 1,200,000 pounds in October
over that of the preceding month,
there is no evidence in the copper
metal market to warrant any higher
production at the present time. As
a matter of fact, the call for the
red metal is dull, with the result
that during the past few weeks
there has been a slight easing in
price. General- quotations with the
leading agencies for any large quan
tities is now 21 cents a pound, al
though smaller agencies are shading
this figure.
Production of 7,000,000 pounds last
month was- the highest which Ins
piration ha3 reported since last De
cember, 100,000 pounds higher
than last April, which up to now has
been the previous best month. For
the ten months Inspiration has pro
duced 64,500,000 pounds, a decrease
of approximately 19,000,000 pounds
from the corresponding months of
1918. For the full year, the decrease
in output from a year ago should
be about 20,000,000 pounds.
On an output of 98,540,000 pounds
of copper last year Inspiration earn
ed for the outstanding 1,181,967
shares of capital stock $6.96 'each.
The average price received in 1918
by the company for copper was
24.77c per pound while production
casts, including' freight and market
ing, was 11.25c per pound.
During the early part of this year
copper .was a drug on the market
at a price of 15 cents a pound from
which point It advanced to 23 cents,
although not much copper was dis
posed of at the latter figure. With
approximately 20,003,000 pounds of
copper less this year, and a much
lower average price received than
In 1918, while costs have remained

will be able to show a balance suf

INCREASE FOR
1 INSPIRATION IN
P ARIZONA CLAIMS
tial mineral showings in the over
burden could be accepted as suffi
cient to constitute discovery, as in!
the case of the Rough Rider and
other claims which were finally
patented because it was felt .that the
previous patenting of similar claims
in the vicinity had established a
rule of property.
But, generally speaking, lands of
the character contemplated by the
proposed legislation cannot now be
patented under the existing mining
laws unless discoveries are made by
deep drilling or shaft sinking. On
the other hand, large areas of such
land were in the early day3 patent
ed under the non-mineral laws, under
the rule which then prevailed that
land could not be classified as min
eral in character, or patented as a
mining claim, unless mineral had
been actually disclosed. In recent
years, however, the department has
adopted the rule that, through geol
ogical deduction as to underlying de
posits land may be classified as
knewn mineral in character, and
now declines to patent such lands
under the non-mineral laws. .
There are thus large areas of
land in the four states mentioned
which the land department recog
nizes, or would recognize, as being
mineral in character, but which, re
main undeveloped because title there
to cannot, as a practical proposition,
be acquired under the present min
ing law.
To justify the great ' expense of j
exploration by drilling or sinking
shafts to a great depth, as well as
the great outlay in working shafts,
machinery and equipment for actual
mining operations, it Is necessary
that a reasonably large acreage be
acquired or controlled. To operate
on the extensive scale required, not
only are extensive ore bodies re
quisite, but a large area of surface
is also required for reduction plants, j'
tailing dumpts, etc.
The proposed legislation is design
ed to encourage the exploration and
development of such lands by giving
to any one who will undertake deep
exploration work the right to control
and acquire an area of not to exceed
1,280 acres (which is about the min
imum area now held by any of the
large, porphyry copper mining com
panies) upon conditions carefully de
signed to prevent abuse of the
privilege.
apprehension to be felt about the- j
continuation of the $6 per annum J
rate, as the company during the re- j

dividends for some time yet. It Is i
not to be expected that conditions
will remain in the present state
much longer, for with the signing
of the peace treaty there ought to
be an urgent demand from the Cen
tral Powers. '

A THOUGHT FOR THE DAY
"The Socialist . . . will continue to hope that selfish men may
be so manipulated that they will behave unselfishly that the effects
of goodness may be had without the goodness. He has unwavering
faith in a social alchemy which out of ignoble natures will get noble
actions." . " Herbert Spencer.
POLITICAL PROCRASTINATION AND
INDUSTRIAL DEPRESSION
u
NSETTLED business conditions continue throughout the nation
and are destined to so continue until peace terms with Ger
many, league of nations or no league of nations, are definitely
concluded. The United States of America is suffering today
from an overdose of .political obtuseness nothing more and nothing
less.
Industrial unsettlement, financial stringency and depression of
exchange are directly attributable to the dilatory tactics of the
United States senate in regard to the peace treaty. The nation is
undergoing a period of restless and chaotic uncertainty as to what
to expect next, all because the legislators who have the affairs of
the nation largely in their hands see fit to turn a deaf ear to the
nation's needs while engaging iu a political war.
During the months the senate has been waging wordy debate
over the merits of the league of nations, business has practically
stood still, both because of uncertainty of the outcome, and because
of lac kof foreign markets.
Conclusion of peace with Germany means more than the opening
of foreign markets and the terminating of business depression. It
means that the decks will be left clear for action in speedy quelling
of thetreacherous radical element which always rears its ugly head
during a period of national unrest. It means termination of the
career of the I. W. W.;'it means remedying of the high cost of living
bugaboo; it means an end of the period of extravagance in which
the nation has been plunged in natural reaction to the business of
war. All these illnesses of the body politic will cease as soon as
the conclusion of peace lends the country back into normal, sober
channels of business enterprise, constructive industry and political
regeneration. . ;
The procrastinating United States senators, indifferent to the
great national trust imposed upon them, or incompetent to judge the
national interest, have much to answer for.
ROOSEVELT AND HIS CHILDREN
J
IT is not customary for the Review to call attention in its editorial
columns to special features of its service to thereading public
of the Warren District, but irt the publication of the letters of
the late Theodore Roosevelt to his children, which will begin in
the next issue of the Review, on Tuesday morning, this paper be
lieves it is offering a feature to which special notice of its readers
should be directed.
These letters, the Review believes, are destined to go down in
American literature as classics of their kind. Of Roosevelt, the
public characterwidely loved as no other American since Lincoln,
and like Lincoln loved even by his enemies there 13 little left to be
said, for the average American knows him as president, as author,
as explorer, as orator, as a great, vital force in modern American
life, as well s he knows Lincoln or Washington. But to know
Roosevelt the father and husband to know him in his tender,
whimsical private mocds and affections in the bosom of his family
this is indeed a privilege for the American citizen.
These letters show more than the parental side of the Roosevelt
nature. They are brimful of sound principles, showing how the man
whose first and foremost love ws for America, instilled that love
into the hearts of his children.
The letters are being offered to the American public now for
the first time. The Review, through the progressive business policy
of the Newspaper Enterprise Association, of which it is a client, is
able to publish these letters exclusively in this district. They will
be found well worth perusal by the Review's rapidly growing family
of readers. One letter, illustrated, will appear each day in the
Review, until the esries is completed.
THE LEGION FOR TRAINING
THE American Legion's indorsement by a unanimous vote of a
military policy based on the principle of universal military
training is perhaps the most important event in the course of
the movement for national det'ense. It is the legion's first
conspicuous public pronouncement, and an earnest of what this
splendid organization in America's manhood" will accomplish lor our
country in these trying days and in the years to come.
This vote of the American Lesion represents the judgment of
men who know what modern warfare is. It represents intelligent
patriotism. It represents devotion and sacrifice accomplished.
If this voice is not heard and heeded at Washington, no voice in
America deserves to be.
The Legion in the same resolution put itself on record in oppo
sition to compulsory service in time of peace. Other advocates of
military training will heartily endorse this action also. Military ser
vice in time of peace should be given by the regular army, as at
present. This force of volunteers, commanded by professional offi
cers, must be maintained for garrison duty in our possessions, tor
expeditionary work, and for the preservation of law and order, ex
actly as untler the present regime.
Military training of our young men has nothing to do with this.
The compulsion extends only to the duty of training in time of peace,
so that if war should come again, the call of their country will find
them ready. .
The nscilists try to frishlen parents by asserting that I heir boys
will be sent in peace time to the Philippines or the Caribbean or
some disease stricken, remote spot. Under the military training
system their boys will go to a great, open air school of health, manli
ness, and patriotism, a training rump where they will have an expe
rience that will be of inestimable benefit to them and their country
in peace, or, if need he, in war. They will so to this school and they
will stay there until they return to the'r homes.
Thousands of American boys who might bo safe home today are
lying in the soil or France because the Ameriean republic, while re
quiring service, as all nations do and must, for its defense, did not
train its citizenry for the difficult and complicated duties of the
camp, march, and battlefield. The men of the Legion have pood rea
son to know that. If their voice is not heeded congress will be guilty
of a crime against the nation of today and the soldiers of tomorrow.
Radicals oppose the use of the injunction. AH of Germany was
bitterly opposed to the strategy ot F'och.

PEPY'S DIARY IN BISBEE
Nov. 22. To town through the rain, glad to be at work again, and with
the chance to make the daily poems rhyme and force their feet to track,
and, in all truth, 'tis pleasant even to labor and to look forward to the daily
task. Much talk this day about the fights of Friday night, which were full
of excitement, so that my hat dropped in the water pail and I broke the
only cigar I had as a gift during the day. And afterwards Kid George did
tell me of his long life in the ring, and of the men he has fought, so that
I listened with a mighty interest, marveling the while at the difference
there is in men, for to me a poke in the nose is anything but pleasant and
a jab to the stomach is an abomination. Up late last night, waiting for
the lights to go on again, and talking in the dark with the printers, but not
much of any moment, so that I left after a while, tramping through the mud
of Tombstone canyon and rehearsing all the swear words that I knew, so
that by the time I reached the house I had forgotten my discomfort in con
sidering the unexpected wealth of my vocabulary. Wondered, too, today at
the large number of women who go to the prize fights, which, it seemed
to me, argued for two thinly the cleanness of the sport and the change
that woman suffrage is going to make in this world of ours, with the weaker
but more insistent sex slowly pushing us from the clay pedestal where we
have reigned so long. But the bitterness of this consideration was softened
somewhat by the thought that even when we reigned there was usually a
petticoat behind the throne to send the orders. To Mr. Lyman, at the offices,
with whom I talked of divers things, but especially of children, and he won
dering why so many geologists have daughters and no sons, and we could
not find the reason, although I had it on my tongue to say something about
prohibition. To the office, where there was some work from the day before,
which I could not get in the paper because there were no lights, and so,
with the daily grist, I was very busy. Home this night with Mr. Death, who
has a Studebaker, and. who can make it sit up and bark, so that we had a
pleasant trip, talking about the fights and looking out for the chuck-holes
in the road. My wife in' good humor, so that I think that Sunday may be
pleasant, if her temper does not change with the thermometer. Resolved
this night to go to Church, whieh reminded me of Mr. Scot. P. Schaffer, who
went to church a week ago and sat by the assistant cashier and went to
sleep, snoring, so they say, in perfect time with the doxology and switching
the tempo with the hymns,- which is a gift.

Septic sore throat is a highly com

throat which frequently occurs in epi

It is characterized by a redness and
soreness of the mucous membrane of
the throat, enlargement of the glands
in the neck, fever and prostration.
The throat at first is generally dif
fusely reddened, somewhat as in scar
let fever; later white patches appear
in the majority of cases which some
times fuse to form a membrane sug
gestive of diptheria.
The stubborn enlargements or the
neck glands are highly characteristic.
Tho temperature is more or less ele

Fahrenheit or more, and weakness is
pronounced and out of proportion to
the local symptoms. In some instances

EXERCISE TO ADD BEAUTY TO
NECK.
The neck and shoulders may be
developed and given additional sym
metry, says a certain beauty expert,
by the following exercises, morning
and night, combined with deep
breathing throughout the day. While
in a sitting position, raise the arms
sidewise to the height of the shoul
der. Move the hands as little as pos
sible while pushing the arms back
strenuously for ten times, with the
palms backward. Then, folding the
arms back of the body, push the
shoulders backward and forward with
an alternate motion. Gradually, this
can be increased to as many as 20
times, although it is wise to begin
with a repetition of the movement
not more than five times.
The only absolute necessity appears
to be that the blossoms be white in
the first place. ' The same acids may
be. applied with similar results, to
other white flowers, such as white
white blossoms red, and alum turns
white blossoms red, and alumn turns
them to a faint lilac shade.
BIG HAT IS IN FAVOR.
By Betty Brown.
NEW YORK. Nov. 22. The first

winter coats in popularity. That

SCIENTIFIC WINDOW WASHING.
For the weekly or bi-weekly win
dow washing at our house, we think
there is nothing quite so effective as
a chamois skin.
Wring the chamois out of warm
water and wash the window, just as
you would with a cloth. Then dip
the chamois into fresh water, wring
as dry as possible and wipe the
window.
That's all there is to it and the
window will look perfectly clear and
clean and not "streaky."
But a really dirty window cannot
be washed in this easy fashion.
Moral for frequent window washing!
What I mean is that for outside
window washing the use of a cham
ois is not advisable. Rain beating
against the glass makes the dust
stick and become hard to remove.
All drug stores carry chamois
skins of various sizes and money in
vested ' in a' skin about 18 inches
square will be a paying investment.
