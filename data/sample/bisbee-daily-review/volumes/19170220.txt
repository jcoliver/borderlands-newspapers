WILSON AND WASHINGTON
SHOCKED BY SUDDEN LOSS
DF D. S. FINES! SOLDIER
(By Review Leased Wire.)
WASHINGTON. Feb. 19. Major General Funston's
sudden death came as a great shock to high officials of the
army and io President Wilson. He was one of the. distingu
ished commanders of the service and one of whom greater
things were expected in the future. The youngest major gen
eral of the line, vigorous and apparently healthy, he had been
counted by his superiors for many more years of active ser
vice.
Shocks
The news reached the war
brief despatch from the headquarters of the southern depart
ment. It was telephoned to Secretary Baker's home, where a
dinner was being given to the President, with most of the
ranking army officers in Washington among the guests.
Secretary Baker made this statement:
"General Funston's death is a loss to the army and a loss
to the country. During the trouble on the Mexican border
his work has been difficult, exacting and delicate. His con
duct has been that of a soldier, and he has exemplified the high
tradition of the American army by his quick, intelligent ef
fective action. Throughout it all the sympathy between Fun
Eton and the department has been complete and no shadow
of disagreement has arisen.
"I am deeply grieved personally at his death and feel that
his loss to the country is very great."
Pershing May Succeed Him.
Major General Pershing, who has been in command of
the El Paso district since the withdrawal of the American ex
pedition from Mexico, automatically will succeed to the duties
of commander of the southern department ; until an appoint
ment has been made. Recently made a major general, he is
the only officer of that rank now assigned to the department.
As immediate successor to the '
command,, General Pershing will
have charge of the many details
of the movement of the remaining
national guards home fronVtbe
border. It is expected here that
this movement, plans for which
were worked out by General Funs
ton as virtually his last military
duty, will go forward without in
terruption. Was Real Fighting Man.
When Funston won bis rank of
brigadier general as a reward for
his spectacular capture of Agui'n
aldo, the Philippine rebel chief,
his active service in'' the regular
United States army began. Ho
speedily reached . the top of the
list of brigadiers, but when there
were vacancies in the list of
major generals, he was passed
over no less than six times by
Presidents Rxsevelt and Taft. At
times Funston almost despaired
of further promotion but with
characteristic tenacity he stuck
to the army.

When Vera Cruz was occupied.
Major General Wood, chief of
staff, immediately selected Funs
ton as the logical man for the
field command. Every army offi

WASHINGTON, Feb. 19. Presi
dent Wilson has sent a letter to
Chairman Stone of the foreign rela
tions committee urging action during
this session of congress on the treaty
to indemnify Colombia for the parti
tion of Panama. '
The President is said to have point

if any difficulties should arise with
any power on this hemisphere. Sena
tor Stone called a meeting of the for

Opposition to the treaty has been
so vigorous in the senate that it has
been impossible even to get it up for
discussion, notwithstanding the com
mittee amended it at the last session
to reduce the indemnity to be paid
Colombia for the partition of Panama
from $:5,000.000 to $15,000,000.
Senator Stone said tonight he did
not know whether in the light of the
new international situation the senate
could be prevailed on to act.

Illness and Overwork Till End
(By Review Leased Wire.)
SAN ANTONIO. Tex., Feb. 19. Major General Frederick Funston. commander

Death was almost instantaneous. General Funston was 51 years old.
Worked Too Hard.
Ever since March, 1916, when he was placed in command of all United States
forces on the Mexican border, General Funston had worked at an unusual pace. At
critical times in border developments he frequently remained on duty twenty-four hour3
of the 24. The handling of regulars disposed at various stations on the border; the Per
shing expedition and, of late, rearrangement of regular troops while providing for the re
turn of national guardsmen, have entailed an enormous amount of detail work, probably
exceeding that which fell to any commander of the United States army since the civil
war. i Only today General Funston completed orders for the return of the last of the
guardsmen.

(Special to the Review)
PHOENIX, Feb. 19. Probability of
an extra session of the legislature be
comes less remote with every day.
The fact that the house has not yet
anyways nearly completed considera
tion "of the appropriations bill, and
that there are many members of the
legislature clamoring for other legisla
tion declared to be as important as
lie general appropriations bill and
the continued implied threat of these
members of a tilibuster against any
thing unless their pet measures are j
considered, gives the general impres
sion of an extra session to the veriest .
tyro in legislative pi'oceedure. The ;
educators of tile state, who constitute I
a pretty considerable lobby have in-
troduced so many bills that the entire
education code as now existing will ,
need revision, and they are demand
ing action. The politicians are de
manding equally strongly that some
thing be done to clear up the ijn
flict and rough places in the present
election law, the good roads advocates
want good roads bills passed, and the
tax levy bill ha3 yet to be introduced.
Coupled vi:h all this there we more
than 100 measures on the calendar-of
the house that have reached the com
.nittee "of the whole and have not yet
I jeeu considered, and sr far not a
. dozen bUis passed by the senate have
! been any more than noticed by the
j house. The recent introduction of the
j.em for schools increasing the com
mon school fuiul to $2,00ii.Ov0 for the
oiiiing two years. lays the foundation
I ior a fight as lasting as that which
.onvulsed ihe former sessions of the
I legislature. Although thi-s was passed
.as an item in. the appropriation bill it
j is conceded that additional bills w ill
j have to be passed dealing with cer-
ain other facts in connection with

Latest Feature of Excellent
Triangle Actor One of the
Best of His Offerings Last
Time at the Orpheum.
In tho new Triangle feature. "Man-
! haltan Madness." to be seen at the
Orpheum Theatre today, Douglas
Fairbanks appears in a mle different
from any of the prelous parts he has
played since he marie his screen de
but. He has appeared as an easterner in
The Lamb," "His Picture in the Pa
pers." anri several other pictures; as
a westerner in "The Good Bad-Man."
ami as a far westerner of mixed des
cent in "The llalffllreed." In "Man
hattan Madness" the athletic star is
of both east and west. Born and rear
ed in New York, educated at an east
ern college, lie goes west atur lus j
graduation, becomes a cow puncher
lor sheer love of the outdoor life and
eventually invests bis money in a
ranch.
After several years on the plains he
returns to the east for a visit, finds
life in Manhattan extremely tame and
tores the members of his club nearly
out of their senses by telling them
j what a dull hole they live in. The
outcome is a. wager in which one or
the club members agrees to show the
rancher a real thrill in Manhattan or j
lose $3,000. The picture then reveals ;
what happens to the young plainsman
who loses his bet. but is well content
because he has the thrill of his life,
including the capture of a bride.
Fairbanks is equally at home in
chaps and sombrero or "soup and
fish." His gymnastic capabilities are
called on to the utmost after he en
ters upon the adventure which fol
lows the wager, and despite some
pretty tight squeezes, he never loses
the "Fairbanks smile."
In the star's support are Jewel Car
men, George Beranger, Mucey Har
lan, Eugene Ormonde, W. P. Rich
mond and Ruth Darling.

Theodore RViberts and Anita Kins
in the Jesse L. La.sky production of
'Anton the. Terrible," will be the at
traction at the Central theatre, Iowell
today.
The story of this thrilling drama of
Riissian political intrigue was written
by Jales Eckert Goodman from Thom
as II. Uzell's story, and prepared for
f'.ie screen by Marian Fairfax and
charts Sarver. It Is a Paramount
Picture.
Thidore Roberts has the supreme
distinction of being America's leading
character actor. In his years on the
stage and screen, he has been seen in
many different roles, in all of which
he has been ideal, but it is said that
as the cruel head of the Russian
secret police, "Anton the Terrible,"
he excels anything he has done here
tofore. The versatile and beautiful Anita
King, the Paramount Girl, who re
cently scored such a success in her
play, "The Race," founded upon her
famous transcontinental uutombbile
trip, plays the part of the young girl
upon whom Anton wishes to revenue
himself for her father's crime. The
role is exactly suited to Miss King's
appealing personam), ana uie msxy i
company feels that they have made1
a most excellent selection in co-star-1
ring these two artists. j
The story which created such a sen-!
sation when it was published in the '
Saturday Evening Ftist, has to do with '
the intrigues in the Russian General's
staff shortly after the outbreak of the
present European war.
Anton, although chief of the Rus-1
sian secret police, is in reality a Ger- j
man spy. How a clever woman, to
save her lover, succeeds in trapping
Anton and confronts him with his own
guilt, is presented In an unusual and
startling manner. The scenes of the 1
picture are laid in Pctrograd and on j
the steppes of Siberia and the plrtto
drama is produced with more than the
usual Lasky excellence, under the per-!
conal direction of William C. De Mille. '

tor. The cast supporting Mr. Roberts !

IN THE RIGHT DIRECTION.
The appropriation committee of the house of represen
. tatives of the Arizona legislature in drawing the present
appropriation bill emphasized particularly the idea that
every department of the state should be limited in its ex
penditures to the actual amount of money needed to
' maintain and operate such department for the two coni-
ing fiscal years, says the Arizona Gazette. In other
words, the committee attempted to carry out the idea
, that the taxpayers of the stalfe are insisting upon, that is,
that there should be seme form of state budget and that
no manner of appropriation shotld be made by the legis
lature that would leave it discretionary with any state
: official, or any state board, to draw upon the state treas
ury for an unlimited amount of money.
The tendency of the house of representatives to follow
the lead of the appropriation committee was very well
. evidenced a few days since when, in questioning U:e
.members of the tax commission as to the needs of that
" department the majority of the commission declared
. themselves in favor of unrestricted appropriation while
the minority, in this case the newly appointed conimis
; sioner, Rudolph Kuchler, declared in a manner both em
phatic and impressive, that while the commission should
not be handicapped in the administration of its duties
. by any lack of funds, he was unaltrrably opposed to t!ii
principle of open appropriations with no limit therecn,
since it is contrary to good business policy not only n
; state affairs but in private business matters as well.
Thereupon the house limited the appropriation with a
provision for additional expenditures in case of emerg
ency. The taxpayers of the state of Arizona are willing
to afford every department adequate means for the ad-
ministration of such department but they are opposed to
'permitting any cfficialr department to even have the
"opportunity of drawing upon the state treasury for un
limited amounts and the house of representatives is to be
congratulated upon its adherence of this idea.
There have been large expenditures of money upon be
; half of the state that undoubtedly would not have been
made had a limitation been fixed within which every
department must act. Thework of the appropriation
'committee is a step in the right direction and will finally
"lead to the adoption of a budget plan for the state.
A WORTHY AMALGAMATION.
Suggestions have been made to the effect that the
Warren District Business Men's Association and the
Warren District Commercial Club be merged into one big,
and more-effective Warren District Chamber of Com
merce. The suggestions are good in many ways.
When the business community of the District, how
ever, decides to eliminate one or both organizations it
should remember that without an organization the nnit-
iter of perfecting credits will be valueless. To" be effect
ive, credit bureaus must be backed by the business com
munity. So in case any consolidation is made let the
credit department of the old be a department of the new
organization, if it is to be effective for v'ie business peo
ple. Better should the two organizations stay apart than
should fhe good of either be impaired by a union.
A FAILURE.
The last big card (Jcrinany had to play unlimited S"a
varfare ia'cius already to have ailed. Ciiuiauy has.
. : riAed war with us. or nothing.
Tiie Germans expected to sink I.'RH'.oimi tons of,fchip
'. ping a month. That rate, they figured, what with the
ships destroyed and those driven from the sea by fear,
would soon bring England face to face with the same
starvation that confronts the German nation, and (orce
a favorable peace.
The rate of destruction up to date has not been half
what Germany hoped for. It amounts to less than JiUO,
000 tons a month. Morcocr, t.'ie rale has rapidly dc-
i creased since the first great onslaught of l-Yli. t.
Thus this campaign follows the -iiir- of its pred'-ee;-
fcors, as might have ln-en aiitieipa'ed At first everything
favored the V loats. They were all at their appointed,
. Htations, fully equipped with aiiitiiunit ion and fuel. The
. j clement ; of surprise helped them, because many mcr
. i cliantmen had not yet been warned. The British navy

were exhausting their torpedoes, shells and fuel, and
must socn return to their bases. Slany of them, in all
probability were sunk or captured. They had done their
worst, and that worst was not enough. And now neutral
ships are venturing to sea again.
Experts have figured that Great Britain has nearly
20,000,000 tons of shipping. She had lost about 2,000,000
tons before the present onslnught. About 6,000,000 tons
are available for non-military purposes. Half of this ton
nage is sufficient to feed the population of the British
Isles. The other 3,000,000 tons are engaged in the mis
cellaneous carrying trade. There is also a neutral ocean
tonnage of 5,000,000 available for British transportation.
Thus, if all the ships remain in commission, Germany
must sink 8,000,000 tons before she begins to cripple the
fundamentally necessary British merchant fleet and
starve the British people. At the present rate, that
would take about a year and a half, if no shops were
built.
On paper, then, Germany has failed. And dispatches
from Berlin indicate that Germany knows it. If the of
fensive decree of January 31 is withdrawn, it will be ir.
recognition of this failure.

" THE DISAPPOINTING HEN.
John Byrnes of Milltown, N. J., had a brilliant idea for
foiling old Cost of Living. He rented a hen. And he
agreed to pay the owner, Joseph Headley, 60 tents a
month for her services.
The hen laid dutifully for two or tiree days, and then
stopped. Her intentions may have been good, but she
happened to discover a nest with a dozen eggs in it, and
a higher sense of duty called her to sit on them. And as
is the way with hens, her maternal duties immediately
interfered with her oviparous productivity.
Now Byrnes has brought suit against Headley, charging
false representation, alleging that Headley knew all the
time that his hen contemplated giving up her job and
adopting a sedentary occupation.
There's a puzzling problem there, involving hen
psychology. How can the courts determine for sure that
lien's state of mind at the time tiie deal was made?
And there's another problem Involved which appears
never to have been determined by any court. Who owns
the chickens that the hen hatched? The man who owned
her, or the man who rented her? It might be argued
that as long as the latter was paying for the hen's ser
vices, he was entitled to all the fruits of her labor. But
he had hired her expressly for laying eggs not for hatch
ing out chickens.
Alas! It's always that .way. Every intelligent attempt
to cut the cost of living seems to end in a mess of prob
lems that nobody understands.
"PLAiN DUTY."
There is no "enthusiasm for war" in this country. If
we are forced into the conflict we shall enter it as the
French did, for the same purpose and with something of
the same spirit.
Ambassador JussTand recently described with wonder
ful vividness and truth the rising of the French nation
on the day when Germany declared war.
"I traveled far by motor through the prosperous fields
and peaceful valleys of sunny France. There women and
children had lived in peace, tilling the soil, raising' their
children and caring for their old folks. And suddenly,
without a warning sign, in the countless villages where
dwell the great mass of the French people, came the
beating of drums and the loud alarm of bells. An unpar
alleled cataclysm threatened rich and poor alike the
learned and the ignorant threatened the whole nation.
"Ar.d what happened? Then I saw. By a common im
pulse, as if the fearful and prodigious event had always
been expected, each one turned his steps to where duty
called.
"There was not a hesitation, not a cry, not a threat
against the enemy. Duty, plain duty, to be fulfilled as
the normal and natural tiling, for which one had been
bom and for which one had always been ready.
"And are those the light-hearted and laughing French
men, as the world has known them and as they have
portrayed themselves? Yes, truly the same. In those
Frenchmen you have the rare spectacle of individualists
who also are self-sacrificing. IMace before them a task
which is greater than their interests, greater than their
persons, a task involving the nation, mankind, liberty,
and their light-heartedness and heedlessness vanish. In
its place dauntless resolution, affectionate co-operation
patience in trials, faith in the outcome.
"What wonder," M. Jusserand added, "that with char
acteristics so. similar, they should understand Ameri
cans?" Our peril is not so great as that of l'raii -. We are not
so well prepared. And it is vain, perhaps, to hope that
iu time of trial we should prove so utterly heroic as tho
French have proved. But we must accept the high com
pliment implied in the French ambassador's words as our
ideal, at least. If the test comes, we shall try to meet it
as France did.
J. H. Stephens, well known mc.her
of Yavapai enun'.v, who sold his in
terests ther.; s.imo n:ne ago for i
000 to Mullen and Schultz, intended
to go to Los Angeles to reside. He
t'jultln't resist the lure of the range,
however, and has purchased two other
ranches, spending $105,00 in the deal.
Both are located in the Williamson
valley.
Cotton growers of the Chandler
region, of the Salt River valley, en
tertained a number of the valley busi
ness men last week at a big barbecue.
Chandler is the center of one o the
cotton raising districts of the bis Salt
River country.
William Gritlith, a chicken fancier
of Chandler, claims to have the rec
ord for an egg producer in the state.
He has a registered Barred Plymouth
Rock hen that layed 20a eggs in 33
days. That hen might move to Bis
bee and be a hero. "

KILLED IN IDAHO
(By Review Leased Wire)
BOISh, Idaho, Ken. 13. An auti
alien land bill, which was killed by
the state senate February 3, as the re
sult of protests by the Japanese em
bassy to the state department at
Washington, was reintroduced in the
senate late today.
The bill, which had passed the low
er house, was killed by the senate
from patiiotic motives. It was rein
troduced today as the result of charg
es made in affidavits filed at Wash
ington with the state department that
the Japanese embassy's protest had
not resulted from orders from Tokio,
but from the activities of an Idaho at
torney, C. M. Booth, who was quoted
by the affidavits as having said he
had brought pressure to bear on the
embassy and the state department
through a Washington attorney.
Booth denied the charges, saying
the statements were false and absurd.
He has been subjoenaed to appear be
fore the senate or a senate committee
Wednesday. He admitted. It was
said, that he transmitted the sub
stance of the anti-alien bill to Wash
ington.
Booth declared that "certain sinis
ter influences are at work to embroil
the United States with Japan over the
Idaho anti-alien land law in order to
distract attention from the submarine
issue with Germany."

Service and to be shown
today at the Eagle Theatre, we.re
made in Cuba, where Director Rich
ard Itidgely Truunelle and Robert
Coness spent several months filming
this and other subjects. An army of
Cuban insurgents had to be pro-, ided
for the story, and Mr. Itidgely recruit
ed th services of several hundred
natives, a number of whom had actu
ally served under th'j patriot General
Garcia.
When Charles Sutton "made up"
for the part of Garcia, appeared upon
the scene for the first rehearsal, sev

that their beloved leader had return
ed in person to command thftii in
this mimic battle for "Cuba Libre."

THE BISBEE DAILY REVIEW, TUESDAY MORNING, FEBRUARY 20, 1917.
Mining and Financial News ;
BY REVIEW
KU' YORK. Feb. 10.--Irregular ad
vances wort- registered in today's pro
fessional market. Shippings were al
trost the only noteworthy exception.
Trading was dull save for the first
hour. Leading rails averaged gains'
or 1 to Vi although advices report a
halt In freight traffic arising from
prevailing congestion. Shortage of
ears showed an increase over the flp
ures recently announced.
Production at some of the western
Industrial centers Is again threatened
by the coal shortage.
Today's advance, like, that of Sat
urday, resulted largely from short
covering. Sugars, leathers, fertilizers
and Industrial Alcohol were one to
four points better, their recovery also
being attributed to purchases for the
short account.
Total sales of stocks amounted to
443.000 shares.
Transfer of $2,500,000 gold to the
Pacific coast probably represented a
further drawing down- of Japanese
bank reserves here.
Bonds were irregular. United King
doms losing a small fraction, while
Anglo-French fives were firm. Total
sales par value, were J3.520.000. U.
S. bonds were unchanged on call.
CHICAGO GRAINS
CHICAGO. Feb. 19. Improved ship
pins conditions gave much firmness
to the wheat market today, and so did
a material increase of the number cf
unfavorable crop reports from the
domestic winter belt. Prices closed
strong half to 2Vs net. higher with
May at l.T'.i to 1.7C and July at
l.."04 to 1.50. Corn gained to lc
oats to and provisions 2Vi to
20c.
Word that seaboard clearances for
the day actually exceeded the corres
ponding total of a year ago liad an es
pecially stimulating influence. It
was also officially announced that
nearly 600,000 bushels of grain had
lepn shipped out of Chicago by rail
drring the last 48 hours.
In some quarters prediction of a
sensational crop scare within a few
weeks were current.
.In the corn market the strength of
wheat was the dominating factor. The
fact that receipts continued to be
light was a bar to any decided react
ion from advances. Oats rose in re
sponse to seaboard buying. It was
said 1,000,000 were taken for the east
to be shipped as soon as cars were
available.
Provision values hardened chiefly
because of the lightness of stocks of
lard.
METALS MARKET

BOSTON, Feb. 19 Price or 37

tracts purchase of the copper shares
at present low levels and each day
this class of securities shows im

proportions are now practically as
sured for 1917 and less attention is
now being given to the possibility of
the price of metal after the war as
there is little chance of an early
peace.
The stock market is sold to a stand

Tells Rheumatism Sufferers to
Eat Less Meat and ,
Take Salts. !
Rheumatism is easier to avoid than
to cure, said a well-known authority.
We were advised to dress warmly;
keep the feet dry; avoid exposure; eat
less meat, but drink plenty jf good
water.
Rheumatism is a direct result of
eating tct much meat and other rich
foods that produce uric acid which is
absorbed into the blood. It is the
1 unction of the kidneys to filter this
tcid from the blood and cast it out in
the urine; the pores of the skin are
also a means l freeing the blood of
this impurity. In damp and chilly
told weather the skin pores are closed
thus forcing the kidneys to do double
jvork, they become weak and sluggish
cad fail to eliminate the uric acid
vnictl kePs accumulating and circu-.
li4ins tnruSh the system, eventually
settling in the joints and muscles caus-
.ling stiffness, soreness and pain called
racumatism.

about four
tablespoon-
B'il in a glass of water and drink be
fore breakfast each morning for a

acid by stimulating the kidneys to nor

these impurities.
Jod Salts is inexpensive, harmless
and is made from the acti "of grapes
and lemon juice, combinecTwith lithia j
and is used with excellent results by
thousands of folks who are .subject to
rheumatism. Here you have a pleas

which helps overcome uric acid and is
beneficial to your kidneys as well. Ad

Reared in Kansas.
Funston, a nuiive oi Ohj and reared
on a Kansas lami, had a rctiiarHauie
career before he became a soldier.
Few people knew that Ins first work
was a scientist with a bent toward
botany. "As an agent of the uepart
ment of agriculture in liiDl he took
part in the Death Valley expedition;
then he explored Alaska and the
British northwest and crossed Alaska
to the Artie Ocean and travelled lrom
McKenzie river to Bering Sea, a
journey of about 3,500 miles. He camp
ed in the Klondike during the winter
of 1893 and then alone boated down
the Yukon in a canoe, a journey oi
hundreds of miles through a wilder
ness without seeing another living
soul. Soon after tnat he resigned
from the department of agriculture
and travelled in Mexico.
Fought in Cuba.
When the last Cuban insurrection
broke out Funston applied to the
revolutionary junta in New York for
service with the rebel army, but the
Cubans suspected him of being a spy
or an agent of the I'nited States
runnine violators of neutrality laws.
,.. ,, ' ,. . . ., . ... . 1
Finally he convinced them of his in.
tentions and for many weeks, in a
rOm on an out of the way street on
the lower East Side of New Yor'.,
Funston instructed recruits in the
handling of machine gur,3. of which
the Cubans were ignorant. Soon alter-
.ard he was 'taken into the CuLau
;raiy with a commission.
