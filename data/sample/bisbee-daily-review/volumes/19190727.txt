Over Fate of Treaty at Hands
Of United States Congress
PARIS, July 26. (By the As
sociated Press). There is much
speculation in conference circles
as to what the exact status of
the German treaty would be were
the United States senate to ratify
it with reservation or amend
ments. Many of the delegates
take the position that it would be
possible for the supreme council
to approve the modifications made "
by the senate. Others believe that
approval of the changes would be
necessary on the port of all the
signatory powers.
President Wilson, before leav- ,
ing Paris, is known to have be
lieved that any change by the
senate would make imperative a
renewal of the negotiations with
all the signatory powers, and re
sult in g-eat delay before Ameri
ca could be admitted to the"
League of Nations.
President Wilson's view that
changes must be passed upon by
individual countries is apparently
not shared by many delegates.

STARTS II NEW
ANANIAS CLUB
Denial Is Issued By President
That His Wife Has Evidence
Of Brutality to Patient In
Army Hospital in France
WASHINGTON, July 26 President
Wilson in a letter to Representative
Dallinger, Republican, Massachusetts,
made public tonight, characterized as
"entirely inaccurate" a recently pub
lished statement by John W. Kehoe, a
hospital superintendent of the Knights
of Columbus, that Mrs. Wilson ob
tained personal evidence in Paris of
brutal treatment of American military
prisoners.
A dispatch trom New York quoted
Mr. Kehoe as saying Mrs. Wilson
while at base hospital No. 57 was
beckoned to the cot of a soldier who
aispiayea "numerous weus on ms
arms and back," and that she report
ed this to the president with the re
sult that "the entire guard staff were
brought up on charges and removed."
In the correspondence with the
president, given out by Mr. Dallinger,
the latter quoted from the newspaper
account and asked for additional in
formation so that he might "learn
from the war department the punish
ment meted out to those guilty."
The president replied as follows:
"My dear Mr. Dallinger: The news
paper article too which you refer was
entirely inaccurate. Mrs. Wilson saw
no evidence of violence on the patient
whom she met in base hospital No. 57,
and her inquiries brought out the fact
that whereas one of the prisons used
by the American army in Paris had
been delivered over to them in a very
bad condition the conditions had been
rapidly corrected, and such harsh
treatment as had been practiced in
one or two Instances had been prompt
ly checked.
"Very sincerely yours,
. .. "WOODROW WILSON."
With the correspondence Mr. Dal
linger gave out a statement to the
effect that he could not reconcile the
president's favorable references to
prisons with the recent testimony of
General March, chief of staff of the
army, "showing conditions rivalling
that of Siberian prison camps."

of Republicans;
Draft Reservations
Presented
WASHINGTON, July 26. (By As
sociated Press) The next important
move in the sjenate disagreement
over reservation' to the peace treaty
is expected to come from President
Wilson.
Having canvassed the senate situa
tion in his conferences with 15 -Republican
senators, all of whom are
said to have told him they would
support certain reservation, it is ex
pected the president soon will make
known definitely his attitude toward
such a course. ,;It was indicated at
the White House today that expres
sion of views on the subject might
not await his speaking tour to begin
two weeks hence, but might be em
bodied in a public statement in a
few days.
Republicans Present Draft
This aroused great interest. Sev
eral Republicans .have told Mr. Wil
son the treaty never could be ratified
without interpretative qualifications
and yesterday at the suggestion, it
is understood, of Republican Leader
Lodge, a tentative draft of reserva
tions indicating in' a general way the
trend of opinion among many Repub
lican leaders, was laid before the
president by Senator Spencer, R
publican, Missouri.
Leaders for the reservations say
it is now the' president's move.
The group of Republicans who, un?
der the leadership of Senator Mc
Cumber, North Dakota, and McNary,
Oregon, are working hard on a res
ervation program designed to clarify
the League of Njtions covenant with
out vitally weakening it, believe the
president will announce his accept
ance of such a course, and that quick
ratification of the treaty will ensue.
InVheir talks with Mr. Wilson, they
say, he has indicated no radical an
tagonism to senate qualifications, his
only fear being that the whole sub
ejct might be thrown back into re
negotiation. The president's Demo
cratic supporters in the senate are
not in accord with view and predict
he will assert himself for unreserved
ratification and then go to the coun
try in an effort to fortify public sen
timent behind that stand.
The president saw no Republican
senators today, but in a letter to Mr.
Lodge he replied to inquiries about
the treaty sent to the White House
by the foreign relations committee.
He wrote that insofar as he knw,
no decision had been reached for di
vision of Germany's indemnity pay
ments under the treaty's provision
that it shall be allotted among her
enemies "in the proportion which has
been determined by them in ad
vance." The letter also said Mr. Wilson was
preparing to send the committee pa
pers they had asked for in connec
tion with the Versailles negotiations.
The last sentence of the letter was
interpreted in some quarters as
meaning that the president would
withhold some of the documents in
his possession, though the commit
tee's resolution was very sweeping In
character, asking for "all data" that
concerned the negotiations.

IN RAIL RATES
WASHINGTON, July 26. Criti
cism of the Tailroad administration
for reducing freight rates on imports
received on the Pacific coast was
voiced in the house today by Repre
sentative Fordney, Republican, Mich
igan, chairman of the ways and
means committee. r
The result was a discrimination
against American manufacturers, a
hardship to workers, and in effect a
reduction of tariff duties, he said.
Mr. Fordney referred to President
Wilson, "our general manager," and
added that he had discriminated
against his people in favor of the
Orient, South America and Mexico."
Mr. Fordney said he had a list of
483 articles on which the freight
rates were lower on the foreign pro
duct than on the American. Increas
ed revenue for the railroads while
under government control." he con
tinued, "had been obtained at a price
to the general public. For every 77
cents of increased revenue of the rail
roads." he asserted, "We have spent
123 cents. If that is not extrava
gance, I know what it is: It is in
competence." Marine Strike Is

In Pursuing Bandits With

WASHINGTON, July 26. De
siring to elect a civilian president,
a group of prominent men in Mex
ico City are urging Ygnacio Bon
i I las, the Mexican ambassador to
the United States to become a
candidate for the presidency of
Mexico, according to information
received today through official
channels.
Ambassador Bonillas has not
authorized the use of his name in
the campaign and he said today,
he desires to retire to the practice
of his profession, engineering.
WASHINGTON. July 26. Despite
the operation of a few bandits in some
districts, Mexico has a stable govern
ment, and foreigners are accorded ev
ery protection Ambassador Bonillas
declared today in a statement on the
situation in the southern republic ad
dressed to the American people.
The ambassador's statement fol
lows: "Mexico today has a stable govern
ment, though there are some disturb
ances by a few bandits at large.
"Mexico is in the aftermath of a
civil war, and the Irregularities in
thefee few areas are such as have
followed such struggles in all lands.
In your own south it was many years
after Oppotomas before conditions
were restored to normal, and your
central government was occupied a
long time in the work of pacification,
in a few of the remoter districts. Yet
because the James boys, the Apache
Geronimo, and other bandits in the
southwest continued their depreda
tions after the civil war, no one would
have urged that the American govern-
i mcnt was 'unstable.'
' In addiiion to the after-effects of
the civil strife there are parts of Mex
ico in which conditions today are
much like they were in your own west
not so many years ago.
Cites Previous Co-operation.
"Your army was kept busy for two
generations by the Indians and band
its of the west. Within my own mem
ory the border districts of Mexico
were raided almost constantly by In
dians escaping from your own Bide of
the border. Co-ojeratton of the two
governments (treaty of 1882) in the
matter of pursuit of bandits and cat
tle thieves across the international
line resulted in the suppression of
most of these disorders in the early
eighties, culminating in the capture
of the Apache. Geronimo, and his
band of Chiricahua Indians by the
forces of General Miles in 1S86.
Urges Renewal of System.
"Wc are now trying to arrange for
a renewal of the former system. For
eigners in Mexicoo today are accorded
every protection. In the few disturbed
areas they are occasionally made the
victims of bandits but in every case
the government is devoting the ut
most energy to the pursuit and pun
ishment of the criminals.
"In the areas the foreigner under-'
goes a risk that he assumes when he
enters such an area and his peril is

Mexico to Meet All Debts. j
"Mexico has never repudiated any
of her international obligations and
will meet every debt which is due.
She has the resources to discharge
every obligation without making any
serious drain on her national wealth
and as fast as these assets become
available wilh the revival of industry
she will meet her obligations. In the
oil regions there has not been one in
stance of confiscation, nor are the
companies paying royalties. In 1918,
they produced 64,000,000,000 barrels of

their prosperity and profits.

in my country as the last effort of ex

this country, to precipitate armed in

complete pacification, the rehabitation

It was the need of just such casing that forced the Com

The Directors of the Company wired Mr. Beck to purchase
the casing and ship it at once.
It now only remains for the Southern Pacific Co. to de

This will require perhaps a week.
When received at the well that casing ca i be placed in
the well in two shifts and drilling promptly resumed.
The hole is down 300 feet just 40 feet frcm the sand stra

Happenings of a Week
From Texas Oil Fields
RANGER TO BE
116 GAS FIELD
RANGER, Tex.. July 26. Operators
in the Ranker field are considering
the possibilities of making the Ranger
field the paramount gas field of the
southwest. The territory south of
Ranger is said to be richly underlaid
with an unlimited volume of gas. Op
erators are planning to sink a number
of gas wells there, utilizing the gas of
the vicinity for drilling the well un
til it blows itself in as an oiler. The
operators in this connection plan to
pattern after the Desdemona pool, in
whose early days a number of big
gassers were brought in, which finally
wore down into good oilers.
Four miles south of Ranger, the L.
A. Kightower well of the Texas com
pany is still making a strong pres
sure of gas. This well has Leen turn
ed over to the natural gas department
for use as a fuel producer. The last
of the week, in spite of the heavy gas
pressure the operators gave the well a
20 quart shot of nitroglycerine at
depth of 3060 feet. The well then
made a showing of oil and the gas
production rose to 7,000,000 feet. The
hole is now 3582 feet deep.
The Prairie Oil and Gas company's
fourth test of the E. Roper tract is
completed with the sand first encoun
tered at 3475 feet. No estimate has
yet been set of the production, but it
is believed that it is less than that
of the No. 3, which came in a short
time ago, making 700 barrels.
The Sinclair-Gulf Oil company's test
on the W. T. Davis tract, will no doubt
be a heavy producer when brought in.
The boiler has been moved back and
everything Is prepared for its com
pletion. This well is to be shot within
the week. It is now standing full of
oil at 3492 feet. Should this well
follow the example of other wells in
this vicinity, 'showing the same con
ditions before competoin, it will no
doubt be one of the big producers of
the month.
In the Caddo and Breckenridge dis
trict, the Inability of operators ,to get
materials transported from the rail
way stations of the Texas and Pacific
railroad to their locations is becoming
very serious. A number of wells have
been delayed because of the shortage
of tankage. A number Qf good pro
ducers are expected In soon.
Work is going forward rapidly on
the several pipe lines being construct
ed to various oil fields out of Ranger.
The company which recently took
over the Texas and Gulf Oil and Re
fining company is planning a pipe line
from Ranger to Abilene. A number of
pipe lines are being hurried to the
relief of Desdemona producers, where
it has been necessary in many In
stances temporarily to halt operations.
Oil has caused the town of Eastland,
county seat of Eastland county, Tex.,
to increase its population from 1000
to 10,000 in 12 months. Municipal
water and sewer systems are being
rapidly completed and the former is
planned so It can supply easily a pop
ulation of 50,000. Provision has been
made for 20 miles of street pavement
and blocks after blocks of street ce
ment sidewalks are being laid. Natural
gas is being piped througout the town
and the electric light and power sys
tem is being enlarged. Two' new
school buildings are under construc
tion. More than $1,000,000 worth of
buildings are going up In sight of the
courthouse. Among these are the
Oonnelle theater and the First State
bank and City National bank build
ings. More than $2,000,000 have been in
vested In buildings for industrial and
commercial purposes and an equal
amount in residences during the past
12 months. A $100,000 city hall is to
be commenced in about six weeks and
a $40,000 Y. M. C. A. building has been
financed.

Two New Railroads
To Tap Oil Fields
Breckenridge Belt
Ereckenridge, Texas, is to get a new
railroad, according to a report from
that city. A contract has been made,
says this report,, with the people of
Eastlake, Texas, who are promoting a
road northward, from there, to run it
into Breckenridge. It is said that
more than half of the road has been
graded and that work is progressing
so well that trains should be running
into Breckenridge by November 1. A
bonus of $100,000, with a right of way
from Parks camp depot grounds in
Breckenridge, is said to have been
given. .
The other railroad referred to is the
Kemp & Kell and Jake Hammond
road projected from Newcastle, Young
county, Teaxs, through Breckenridge,
crossing the Texas and Pacific rail
road at Ranger and thence 20 miles
south.

HASTINGS. Okla., July 2G. With
the intention of developing the entire
section between Healdtun and Buik-
burnett, the Texas company has se
lected the most likely anticlines in
the region contiguous to Hastings
and have placed leases on a large
section of the land, beginning at
Hastings as a centra pbiat betweon
me iwo iieius.
The Healdton oil tests from 30 to
38, while the oil found in other, parts
tests as high as 42 degrees Baume.
Most of the oil found in this section
is at or near the contact between
the Permian and Pennsylvania forma
tion; however, on some of the more
pronounced or steeply dipping struc
tures some very good pay sands are
well up in the Permian structure.
J. H. Parker brought in a good well
on the Finli farm in section 32-2s-lOw

TEXAS CRUDE 1
OPEN NEI FIELD
FT. WORTH, Texas, July 2C The
Texas Crude Oil company has an
nounced that it will immediately
open up the Lamar county, Texas,
oil fields, and machinery for the first
work, close te Paris, will be on the
ground within two weeks.
Preparatory to the opening or this
teritory, Texas Crude took over the
East Paris Oil company, with 2500
acres in forty tracts in Lamar coun
ty, much of it close to the city ot
Paris.
' Considerable activity has develop
ed in this field and numerous wells
will be drilled in the near future.
The East Paris Oil company was
organized at Paris with B. B. Stur
geon, J. P. Morris and E. F. Morris
as its officers and principal backers.
The company erected a derrick on
one of its tracts, located 2Vj miles
from Paris and was about to spud
in the well when it was decided' to
turn over the properties to the Texas
Crude.
The men behind the East Paris
Oil company believe that the great
resources of the Texas Crude Oil
company will enable a more complete
and satisfactory exploitation of the
Lamar county territory than possi
bly could be brought about through
the activities of a small local organ
ization. B. B. Sturgeon, J. i Morris apd E.
F. Morris are among the best known
and most substantial citizens of La
mar county and through .the taking
over of the East Paris Oil company
by the Texas Crude Oil company,
these men become stockholders in
the latter company.
Texas Crude plans a full and com
plete development of the new field
and the first well will be drilled
close to the site of the Greenhall i
well which caved ' In after the drill
had passed throug twentyfeet of oil
sand, and a very high quality of oil
had '. been discovered. This oil, ac
cording to an analysis by experts,
was "of a higher grade than anything
produced in Texas.

THE TAFT COMPROMISE.
tact Mmmrnmlpe. we believe offers the only way out
. v ' - - -
of the difficulty into which the peace treaty and League of
Nations hav.j been placed, and we trust that it will be ac
cepted, though, no doubt,, there will be great reluctance on
both sides. We do ntt think the Republican leaders in the senate
can muster enough strength to adopt the Root reservations and we
are equally sure that the friends of the treaty cannot secure the ne
cessary two-thirds vole fcr its ratification without the reservations.
The Taft plan safeguards all that was sought to be safeguarded
by Mr. Root, and as to Article X which it was proposed by him should
be limited in its operation, Mr. Taft proposes an understanding
which, while not impairing that article, leaves the United States the
utmost freedom of action under it. Of the necessity of retaining
the article as the "heart of the covenant," Mr. Taft is convinced. ,
There are two difficulties in the way of the acceptance of the
compromise, largely created by Mr. Taft's characteristic lack of
diplomacy. He has embittered most of the Republican leaders by the
criticism in which he has indulged in his vigorous support of the
League of Nation. The frankness with which he has pictured the
president's partisan activities is not likely to induce an acceptance
by the administration of the Taft plan except as an alternative of
defeat. y
On the other hand the plan of Mr. Taft is one which may bring
together all the Republican senators except the few who are positively
against a League or Nations, and may invite the support of enough
of the uncringing Democrats to secure its adoption. At any rate, at
present, it seems to be the only way out.
The only thing that can be urged against it by those favorable
to the league will be that it will throw" the subject open to renegoti
ation and will tempt other nations to make reservations "with the re
sult that the league will be destroyed before its birth. This objec
tion is without force. If the other members of the league are un
willing to accept interpretations of doubtful clauses which the friends
of the covenant now say the covenant means, there should be a re
negotiation to the end that there may be a complete understanding.
If the other nation have other ideas which they want incorporated
in the covenant, it is better that we know that now than later. The
covenant must be adjusted properly before a start is made.
Mr. Taft does not believe that the reservations he proposes are
necessary. He thinks that they only set out clearly what the cove
nant is intended to mean. He offers them only as a concession to
those who honestly fear that something sinister Is concealed in the
covenant, and who are unwilling to accept the unsupported assertion
of himself and President Wilson that it is not there.
The country, we think, will be with the former president in this
plan. He has been the foremost advocate and the earliest proponent
of a universal peace plan. He had led the campaign for a League
of Nation and he is perhaps the only leader on either side to whom
the suspicion does not attach of having some partisan, selfish, ulte
rior rnqtive for either advocating or opposing the League of Nations.

TUTHILL SUPPORTS
SMITH .IN ACTIONS
AGAINST PRISONERS
DENVER, July 26. Investigation of
prison farm No. 2 at Challes, France,
failed to show brutality toward prison
ers by American guards, Brig. Gen. A.
M. Tuthill, Miamia, former comman
der of the 79th infantry brigade of
which Lieutenant 'Hard Boiled"
Smith was a member, said here to
night.. "I inspected the camp at Challes
with Major General Frederick S.
Strong on one occasion," said Brig.
Gen. Tuthill, "and we both failed to
observe any of the conditions com
plained of. The men appeared to be
well fed, well clothed and as con
tented as prisoners could be."
"It should be remembered that
Lieutenant Smith had some bad char
acters to deal with," said Brigadier
General Tuthill. "The draft caught
all kinds of men, from good citizens
to thi criminal elaes. He was forced
to deal harshly w ith some of the pris
oners because they would go to any
ends to defeat his purpose. Among
the prisoners were men convict&U of
grand larceny, desertion, cowardice in
the face of the enemy and a few for
murder.
"As president of a general court
martial for about a month during
November and December, '1918, I tiied
many of the prisonets who were later
sent to Challes. There were larse
numbers convicted of serious offenses
in addition to hundreds guilty of
being absent without leave and other
minor charges."
Although stationed at Challes while
head of the court martial General
Tuthill did not have command of the
area. He was on detached service at
the time. The district was under com
mand of Col. Edward Grinstead of
Phoenix, Ariz., who was exonerated
by a military efficiency board of all
blame for conditions at the farm.
Answering Colorado officers, mem-
Col. Grinstead was given preference
bers of his former command, lhat
over other officers, General Tuthill
declared Colonel Grinstead to be "an
efficient officer and a good disciplinarian."
These are dog dayb in Russia.

LET'S HAVE NO TYRANNY
New York Times:
If the enforcement bill is passed
in such shape as to include, these en
gines of tyranny, the question will be
no longer one of prohibition or anti'
prohibition, for total abstainers
woud be as much at the mercy "of
malice, oppression and graft as the
hardest drinkers could be. It would
become a question of the right or
the American citizen to protection
not by, but from, the law.
WHENCE MENACE PROCEEDS
New York World:
In order to make prohibition ef--rective,
government must be revolu
tionized, the laws or liberty rewrit
ten and the people subjected to op
pressions against which they have
been taught to believe they were for
ever safeguarded. The worst of it
is that the menace does not proceed
from any party having popular sanc
tion, but from a private and in many
respects secret organization which
never yet has had the courage to
meet its proposed victims at the ballot-box.
The annual grand lodge convention
of the Elks at Atlantic City was by
far the biggest and best convention
the order ever hpld, is the report of
Judge James Allison, who attended
the convention as the Bisbee dele
gate. Eighteen hundred delegates as w;ell
as several thousand members were
present, in fact the convention open
ed with 5000 Elks present on July 8.
- Judge Allison says that representa
tives of the government were at the
convention to thank the order for its
part in war work, more especially the
assistance given disabled soldiers in
caring Tor the men while the govern
ment was temporarily short or fund3
for this work.
Nearly hair a million dollars was ad
vanced to these men by the order to
take care of them until another ap
propriation became available. It was
given to them in loans and every cent
has been- paid back.
Evangeline Booth of the Salvation
Army was the only woman who has
ever been asked to address the Grand
Lodge of the Elks and she was the
first number on the program. She
spoke for over an hour telling of the
work of the Salvation Army on the
front in France and thanked the Elks
for their assistance in the recent
home service campaign.
Judge Allison stated that there was
some interesting airplane exhibitions
in Toledo where he witnessed the one-
! sided Dempsey-Willard fight and he
saw some interesting military camps
in the east as well as some good ball
games in New York.
He slated that he had a most pleas
ant trip outside of the heat in the east
which waB very disagreeable and he
was glad to get back to Bisbee.

CLERGYMAN SUES
BANK FOR $830.00
TUCSON, July 26 Bishop Granjon
of the Tucson diocese, began suit
against the Consolidated National
bank yesterday for $80, together with
interest since October 26, 1916, as the
result of the alleged cashing of a
check by others than to whom the
check was drawn. Moore and Frawley
have been retained by the bishop.
According to the complaint, Bishop
Granjon on October 26, 1916, drew a
check in' favor of the "Commercial
National bank" on the Consolidated
National bank. On October 2S, the
bishop alleged the check was cashed
by a person other than the "Commer
cial National bank,' 'and thereby
hangs a tale of a J. Rufus Walling
ford, who struck town about that time
and caused much grief.
This individual, smooth and polish
ed and suave, solocited subscriptions
throughout Tucson to an insurance
company he was organizing. Those
who bought from him could be assur
ed of getting in on organizer's profits.
When Bishop Granjon decided to join
in the venture he wrote the checK.
To whom should he make the check?
he asked when his pen was pointed at
the dotted line.
"The Commercial National bank,"
the promoter answered.
"But of where?"
"Oh, everybody knows the Commer
cial National bank," said the promo
ter, and he got away with the bluff.
It Is alleged he waited two days and
then rounded up at the cashier's win
dow at the Consolidated Ntional bana,
and presented the check. He looked
all right, suave and well groomed, and
when he asked a cashier's check on
the Commercial National bank of Los
Angeles, in return for the check, some
one forgot precautions and, it is al
leged.the cashier's check was issued
for the check.
THE SPREAD OF BOLSHEVISM
Boston Transcript:
The strike of the car workers of
Boston is tainted with Bolshevism,
although the men may not distinctly
intend to introduce Soviet dictation.
The strikers' demand for an instant
decision in their case from the War
Labor Board is a form of such dicta
tion. The whole idea of Bolshevism
is the control not only of the special
industry in which they are engaged,
but cf other industries and the pub-j
lie administration and service, by the!
workers themselves. All things!
must attend, on them and on them
alone.

The tolal number of merchants who
unquestionably honored checks bear

forged has not been ascertained by the
authorities who made a canvass of the
city late yesterday afternoon. Four
of the worthless bits of paper were
found yesterday. This morning seven
more were turned over to the officers
and it is believed that there are still
others in circulation.
The forgeries were assisted by
checks .used in the payment of the
steam shovel crews. Gaining access
to the office of the chief timekeeper,
the two men secured possession of 7S
blanks, ran 'them through the protec
tograph and spent the morning paying

The Y. W. C. A. is now officially
in charge of all the future sailing of
war brides from Europe. An officer
was sent from Washington to Eng
Jand to make adequate arrangement.
The matter was put up to the Red
Cross, who cabled the government of
ficially that the Y. W. C. A. was tak
ing charge of transportation, pass
ports, lodging in port cities and in
New York, as well aa the actual ocean
voyages of all war brides traveling
to America. It was arranged that
the Red Cross and the Y. W. C. A.
co-operate in New York City in car
ing fdr the women.
" By army ' order the wives of sol
diers are housed in Y. W. C. A. bar
racks at Prest, Bordeaux and St.
Nazarie. The Y. W. C. A. director in
charge is known as the Commander
and her assistant as Assistant Com
mander. Workers to take charge ol
the groups on transports are recruit
ed in Paris. . They go to the debarka
tion camps a few days before sailing
to become acquainted with the brides.
They begin classes in English for
those who do not speak it and in
geography, telliag all they can of the
towns of which the women are go
ing, as well as of the United States
in genera. These classes are con
tinued on the vessel, with American
cooking added. An American mess
sergeant has been assigned to help.
At Bordeaux the Commander of the
Base Section greeted the party:
"We know all about your work in
other ports," he said. "We are mighty
glad to hav e you here w e have bee l
waiting for you. You can count on us
to the last degree to help you."
At the barracks the army supplies
the beds and the kitchen equipment;
the Red Cross gives the living room
equipment. At Brest there are bar
racks for at least live hundred. The
Hostess Houses at these places feed
the brides, with the Red Cross assist
ing in supplying the food.
When Miss Sarah Lyon was jn
Paris recently she accompanied one
bride to the American embassy to
assist her in getting her passport.
As a result of this bit of service, the
embassy requested that a Y. W. C. A.
secretary be stationed there to assist
all the women wio must come rela
tive to their admission to this coun
try. Through the embassy the Y. W.
C. A. is given a list of all the brides.
Greetings are then sent them, tejling
them J he w ays in which the Associa
tion can serve them, in France and
in the United Si ales.
There have been many requests
from soldiers to have secretaries visit
their wives ill in Paris hospitals. This
has been done whenever requested.
The brides themselves ask many
things, sometimes asking that tho Y.
W. C. A. investigate their husband'
financial and social standing. To
the more ignorant of the women, the
secretaries talk ' beforehand about
this strange country to which they
are sailing: ot its customs and con
ventions. Colonel Lyon, director of the Red
Cross WelfaS-e Work in Fiance, re
marked to Miss Harriet Taylor:
"This is the most human thing I
ever heard of an organization's do
ing. No organization without a heart

BY REVIEW
STOCKS AND BONDS
NEW YORK, July 26. Moderate ac
tivity and general strength were the
features of the week-end session of the
stock market. All classes of Issue
shared in the advance except rails, in
which trading was largely restricted
to low-priced stocks.
Overnight announcement of the in
tention of the Standard Oil Company,
of N. J. to double its capital and of
other features connected with the ven
ture, .were accepted as indicative of a
feeling of confidence in the highest
field and industrial circles.
Reversals of one or two points dur
ing the first hour were speedily over
come, mainly as a result of the heavy
absorption of U. S. Steel, taken in
large individual lots up to 113 V4, ap
proximating the week's best. Other
leaders closed within fractions or the
day's maximum quotations. Sales,
535,000 shares.
The bank statement prepared sev
eral interesting features in the con
traction of actual loans and discounts
by $97,000,000, a decrease of slightly
more than $106,000,000 in net demand
deposits, and a nominal increase of
excess reserves.
Bonds were irregular, liberty issues
holding steady on light dealings. Total
sales, par value, $5,350,000. Old U. S
Bonds unchanged on call during the
weeK.
WEEKLY REVIEW
NEW YORK. July 26. The move
ment on stock exchanges this week
lost some of its recent momentum
and price changes were freouentlv ir
regular under pressure, although
steady to linn in the popular leaders
neaution 01 operation was attribut
ed to the customary mid-summer ap
athy. Among international bankine inter
ests a more hopeful feehns: was creat
ed by the passing of te crisis in for
eign exenange, although rates on Lon
don and the DrinciDal continental
European centers are suffieipntiv un
favorable to enmase this country's
overseas trade. In the many develop
ments of the week little attention was
paid to advics from Washington, which
accompanied tne new high record of
exports for the last fiscal year.
According to official commlatinn .
ports exceeded any previous year by
more man seven billion dollars.
One of the most stenificent eviden.
ces since the signing of the amistice
was contained in announcemene by
the Standard Oil Company, or N t i.f
the doubling of its caDital. nrimarilv
for enlargement of its export business.
THE GRAIN MARKETS
CHICAGO, July 26. Prolong
drought and heat led to further ad
vances today in the value of corn.
Closing quotations, thoueh. were un
settled, i4c net to c gain with Sep-
lemDer i.3& to $1.95 and Decem
ber $1.66 to $1.664. Oats finished
a shade to c un. Dreviouslv varvin?
from 2c decline to a rise of 40c. De
cember, the chief crop delivery, show
ed more plainly than other months the
misgivings. Buying of December was
said to bo in the main for the south
west, wuere serious 'damage from
weather would first be likelv to an-
pear. Bulls contended that only soak
ing general rains would avert wide
spread injury. The general disposi
tion was to SO Slow nendinir weathar
developments over Sunday.
Anticipation of demand from Oer-
many for rye and barlev tended to
strengthen oats.

Complaint.
S"o ccanization likes to admit that it
ever receives tompluitita of its work. Kv
ery puWic service of any se does receive
mich complaints, and very naturally theil
Jostal Express Service was no excep
tion. Hut It is significant that there
was only one complaint rfccivcu for ev
ery 500.000 letters lmndl d.
Anxious relatives in the st;.s and
homesick loys in France wrote in to ask
about the non-receipt of mail. Investiga
tion often showed 'hat truir comr.Uii.its
Mere prmaturk. or that the letters in
question had been hopelessly misdirected.
Sometimes the inquiry elicited . the
shamefaced confession from the soldier
that he had been "too busy to write."
The most painstaking core was taken
In Investigating nil service Irregularities
reported. Every complaint was acknow
ledged and a careful search made for the
missing letters. The addressee was com
municated with and the trace was carried
to all stations where there was any pos
sibility of the mail having gone. These
Investigations proved of great value in
disclosing leakages and afforded an accu
rate check on the service.- . ;

SHERMAN WOMAN BELIEVES IN
TANLAC BECAUSE IT HELPED
HER WHERE OTHERS FAILED
"I have more confidence in Tanlac
than any medicine I have ever seen,
and I'll tell you the reason why."' said
Mrs. Mary A. Blette, who lives 'at
227 Palm street. Sherman, California,
a few days ago. "
"I suffered terribly from indiges..
tion for about five years." she con
tinued, "and Tanlac is the ' only
thing that has ever given' me- any
relief. Everything I ate would" sour
on my stomach, and gas would often
form so bad that my heart would pal
pitate something awful. I was so
nervous that a good night's sleep was
out of the question with me. I felt
tired 'and worn out all the time, and
there, was hardly ever a time when 1
wasn't suffering In some way. I lost
fifteen pounds, in. weight and finally
got so weak-and rundown that I was
hardly able ..to get about at al.
Then I commenced taking Tonlac,
and (.lie very first bottle I took made
a big change In my condition and I
Just continued to improve until my
troubles had been completely over
come; I really never enjoyed better
health than I do now. I have a splen
did appetite and everything I eat
Agrees with me perfectly. My nerves
seem' to be In perfect condition, and
I sleep just like a baby every night.
When I fcet up every morning now.
I feel quite different to what I did
before I took Tanlac. I have gained
a good deal In weight, and am so
wel and strong now that I can easily
do all my' housework. Tanlac did all
this for me after everything fls 1
tried had failed, and this is why I
say that I have more confidence In
Tanlac than any medicine I have evef
seen."

With the coming of .the armistice the
shortage ofrolling stock was relieved
by the taking over of 20 German mail
cars. Kailway conditions improved after
the armistice and the transit time of
mail was gradually reduced. Twelve-day
mail sffrvice betwl'eeti New York and
Cohlenz is now not uncommon. Mail
leaving Cohlenz yesterday morning ar
rived In I'aris this morning In time to be
unloaded, sorted and started on its way
to the base ports by noon. Tomorrow
morning' it will be on the docks and then
of course its departure for the States de
pends entirely on the shipping available.
Bigger Than the French Post.
Overburdened from its birth, the Postal
Express Service has never been free from
the pressure of new growth. During the
first month of its existence the service
handled 29.000 sacks of mail. By Decem
Iht the amount had Increased to 132.000
sacks. In January 28 million letters were
dispatched to America ami over 50 mil
lion letters were received from the
States. Incidentally our troops sent
home 15,000 mail bags full of German
helmets and souvenirs during January.
Before troop movement of the States
set in. the P. E. S. was doing a bigger
volume of business than the entire
French -civilian postal system. All this
business was done through' 155 army post
offices. There are now 19. A. P. O.'s In
Germany and Luxemburg, alone.
Courier Service.
-. During the fall of 1918 when the great
est difficulty was experienced in getting
the mails through the French railway
tangle, a Motor Dispatch Service and a
Courier Service were inaugurated. The
M. D. S. was used to bridge gaps where
the railroads broke down and to afford
quick transportation of official and urgent
mail between nearby points.
The Courier Service provided a guar
anteed Quick delivery of official matter
too valuable or too urgent for the ordin
ary, channels. Later-with the arrival of
the American iiejice delegates And tfeeir
staffs, the Courier Service was extended
to serve their needs. Personal convoy
and delivery was provided letween
J'aris and Washington, London. Rome,
Berlin, Brussels. Constantinople and oth
er points. To serve there new require
ments the Postal Express Service estab
lished outpost A. P. O.'s in Berlin, Brus
sels, Rotterdam, Antwerp and Borne.
Christmas Mail.
One of the standards annually used in
judging the efficiency of the I. S. P. O.
Dept., is the manner in which it .dis
poses; of the Christmas mails. If this
standard be applied to the P. E. S. no
thing but commendations cnn.- result.
America sent over nearly 100,000-sacks
of Christmas mail during the second and
third ' weeks of December alone. To
handle this stupendous trnrrtc 173 addi
tional mail cars were required. Yet on
Christmas morning all but 51 of these
cars had reached their destinations and
had been turned over to the addressed
organizations. Had the original last-minute
date for dispatch from the States
been adhered to, it 19 safe to say that
Christinas morning wonld have found
every Christmas package delivered.
The Mail Man.
Xo account of the army mail service,
however brief. Is complete without proper
recognition of the work of the enlisted
man in the P. E. S. Generally he was
a reclassified man. injured at the front,
incapacitated for further duty in the
field. Without previous training he
pitched in to do tht. work that men serve
long apprenticeships at in the States. He
set aU.ut a thankless joo with tireless
energy. Without proper equipment or
sufficient help, he worked all day at his
task. Then he went back at it again at
night until fatigue compelled him to sleep
for a few hours on the rude table at
which he worked in the shack he called
his postoffice or in his mail car marked
"Homme's- 40. Chevaux 8." The service
he furnished was never perfect but its
shortcomings were out . to the insuper
able obstacles of doing a peace-time
business under wartime conditions. As
the French say of their, patriots, "The
A. E. F. mail man le.-rves well of the
American public."

BEHIND HARD-BOILED SMITH WHEN
ITCIET0I1G PUNISHMENT
Members' of 30th Marines Denied Their Connection With
Oraanization on Return to' U. S., in Fear of Retaliation
At Hands of Victims; Hard-Boiled Smith Was Known for
Severity During Sojourn at Naco on the Arizona Border
BY TT. R. WEBB
First Sergeant, Army Service Corps, A. E. F.
WASHINGTON', inly 18. Army of
ficers composing the court-martial
that tried Lieut. "Hardhoiled" Smith
of Arizona, and Lieut. Mason, form
erly In charge of American military
prisoners in France, -where soldiers
are alleged to have been beaten
mercilessly, will be called before a
special house investigating committee
within a few days to explain the sen
tences they imposed, according to
Representative Dallinger, Republican,
of Massachusetts.
Other witnesses will be called, he
declared. In a prepared statement and
"will testify that the trial of these
two men was a joke. Both Smith and
Mason were given only sentences of
dishonorable discharge, the statement
asserted, despite testimony of the
brutality.
HardboiIed Smith arrived at Ft.
Jay, New York, the other day, Dal
linger declared, and "was almost at
once seen by some of his victims
there serving sentence. He was
recognized "by them and before the
guards arrived he waa beaten to a
pulp and I believe he now is in the
hospital recovering from a punish
ment meted out to him by those very
men whom he had himself tortured."
Lieut. Smith Known In Blsbee.
Lieutenant "Hardhoiled" Smith refer
red to In the above was formerly an of
ficer of the old First Arizona Infantry
which later became the 15Sth Infantry in
the 40lh Division, and he was for sev
eral months the provost marshal for this
regiment, being on duty here In Blsbee,
Most all the business people of Blsbee
who were here In 1917 are well acquaint
ed with Lieutenant Smith. He was
a warm personal friend of Adjutant Gen
eral C. W. Harris and was at one time
with the street department of Phoenix
until General Harris placed him In charge
of the armory at Phoenix as a sergeant
Later through the Influence of Harris he
waa given a commission In the First
Arizona Infantry and was with that regi
ment until his arrest last December in
Chelles. France, while In charge of Farm
No. 2 Prison Camp, near Paris. Hia fath
er. Joseph Smith, was private secretary
to President McKinley when he was gov
ernor of Ohio.
Probably the two most notorious cases
of Inefficient and brutal treatment of
the men of the A. E. F. were the St.
Anne Brlgg In the St. Anne hotel of
Paris under the administration of the
30th Marines and what was known as
Farm No. 2 under the administration -of
Lieutenant Smith of the 158th Infantry at
Champs, a little town about 20 miles
east of Paris.
These places became notorious even
before the signing of the armistice find
on November 9, 10 and 11 I became ac
quainted with the working of the St.
Anne hotel brigg and during November
and December visited Farm No. 2 many
times and witnessed things there that
would make any red blooded man wonder
what the American army was coming to.
Lieutenant Smith . incurred the dis
pleasure of the peace officers Jn this
country during his stay here as provost
marshal and was transferred back to duty
with the regiment at Naco in command
of the recruit detachment there and it
was while he was in command of this
detachment that I first made his ac
quaintance In July, 1917. having just
enlisted and being sent to Nacq for duty
I was placed in this detachment for two
weeks under quarantine. x
Lieutenant Smith at Naco.
; Being recruits we were given two
weeks of hard boiled treatment by Lieu
tenant Smith just to show us who was
the bos, but I can't say that at that
time he did anything out of the way
further than to scare the life out of
those not initiated Into the details of
army life. He was a bluffer pure and
simple and those who called his bluff got
away with it.
My r.ext experience with him was when
one day he came down to the company
street with a guard of officers and men
and placed the entire company under ar
rest, by order of the commanding of
ficer, and started a search for the much
sought after liquid refreshments, which
he lelleved was being distributed by
Company I. Including the company com
mander. Capt. E. M. Robinson. Every
tent In the company street and the com
pany officers' tents were searched but
nothing could be found and. ever after
he had it In for Company I. ' There was
plenty of the thirst quencher there and
he knew it but the best he could find
was two empty bottles.
After we moved to Camp Kearny some
of us were sent to schools under Lieuten
ant Smith' and when hi would call the
roll and reach a name om Company I
he would say, "Oh, you're one of those
Company I birds, ' anaiwith his attempt
ed hard boiled methods he became notor
ious within the regiment before we ever
went to France. '
t'pon leaving' for France I did not see
him till one day In November when I was
stationed at Noisel near Farm No.' 2. I
went over to K Company to see one of
the sergeants there and had my first ex
perience in real hard boiled stuff.
I
Prisoners Were Going to "Get" Smith.
Companies I and L were doing guard
duty at Noisel in the prison stockade
similar to the duty of Company K at
Farm No. 2 and as sergeant of the guard.
at the Noisel stockade. I had heard a
great deal of the treatment of the Amer
ican prisoners at Farm No. 2 from con-
it was and no means of getting there.
He had heard that the American head
quarters were in Paris and so went there
to try and find out where his regiment
was. he said, but he was picked up by the
P. s there and thrown in the St. Ann

months time in the stockade.
There were a number of cases where
men had been flischarged from the hos
pital and ordered back to their regi
ment with no money and no trnnsporta
tion or directions as to wher to find
their outfits. The natural thing was to
hunt up some headquarters and try and
find out where their outfits were, but
this generally resulted in being picked
up by the M. P.'s as they had no passes
and no orders to show why they were
Absent from their outfits.
A. W. O. L.'S Numerous.
I went down to a little town in centrrl
France one day by the name of Nerondes
and found a)out 50 of such men who
were camping alongside of the railroad
track where an American height car of
provisions had been side tracked and lost.
They were men of this kind who were
still hunting their regiments but had giv
en up the hunt and were living there off
the contents of this car and had been
there a week or ten days then with -no
Idea of what to do or where to go and
afraid to report anywhere "because thev
knew what to 'expect.
Of coursa on the other hand there were
many men who intentionally went absent
without leave who never really tried to
get back and were ' just : "bumming"
around the country keeping out of sight.
And it was a hard proposition to tell this
kind from the unintentional deserter
through, no fault of his own. Discipline
had to be maintained during the war arid
so the general plan of giving all. A. W. O.
L.'S a sentence of some kind was put into
operation with much injustice to the un
deserving. St. Anne Hotel In Paris.

No. 2 this evening the first thing I bump
ed into was Lieutenant Smith, who was
just entering his ornce without any
blouse, cap or other insigna of rank vis
ible and' two prisoners who had just been
brought in were standing near the door
but of course did not salute him. One
of them asked him for a match and he
immediately jumped all over them for
not saluting an officer. They explained
that they could see no sign of his being
an officer nor ensigna and meant no
disrespect. He called in the first ser
geant. Joe Bush, who is well known in
Blsbee, and ordered Bush to give them
some treatment which was done in a very
efficient manner. These two men were
knocked up against the stone house time
and again until they were unable to get
up, then they were carried into the
stockade and left there to take care of
themselves.
Smith's Trial a Joke.
At Lieutenant Smith's trial in Tours
this April there were any number of
witnesses who testified of a similar treat
ment and three of the instances I waa a
witness to and know them to be facts.
On my return from Germany to Bor
deaux I stopped off at St. Pierre de
Corps, the railroad station for Tours, and
at the depot I met some of the members
of Company K who were there as wit-
witnesses i the case and I asked them
how the trial was progressing. They
said it was a regular joke as some ono
else higher up was trying to withhold the
real evidence to save themselves, but of
course they couldn't prove who it was
hut had a very good idea of who the
higher1 up -as. They stated then that
they xlidn't believe that Smith would get
anything. .There is no question but that
the "commanding officer of the regiment
sanctioned the hard boiled methods. One
day I waa just going on guard when
the officer in charge of the stockade at
Noisel came up to me and ssyi that the
commanding officer had just been out
there and was dissatisfied with the disci
pline among the prisoners and the of
ficer told me to see that the prisoners
id what they were told to do and If
they didn't do it to take a rifle ana
knock them down, also to instruct the
guards to that effect and it would be
sanctioned as something had to be done
to discipline the prisoners. I could not
see that the army regulations provided
for knocking an American prisoner do vn
with a rifle and I couldn't see my .way
lear to obey such instructions .ven in
time of war. I never had any trouble
with any of the prisoners and never
ad. one escape all the time I was doing
uard duly there, yet there was never a
day hardly that one or two did not -cape
from Farm No. 2.
Marines M
got an insight into the methods in use by
these men. I was walking down a boule
vard in the afternoon when two of the
30th Marines came up to me and asked
for my pass. They took it and said I
would have 1 to go to headquarters to
have it verified. : But I told them they
couldn't pull any of that stuff around
me. .Just about that time an officer
whom I was acquainted with came along
and went to headquarters in the St. Anne
hotel with me. The pass waa perfectly
good and the M. P. officer ordered me
released. But while I was there waiting
I noticed that officers of all ranks were,
being brought in to be subjected to ques
tioning and in some cases where they
had secured an extension to their time
limit in the pass this extension was net
recognized and they were thrown in the
brig. Also I noticed a number of men
and officers being taken out of the brig
for trial and several of them had some
awful looking faces. I asked one of them
who he had bumped up against 'and he
said the M. P.'s had started to take his
money away from him and he put up ah
objection with the result that he was
promptly knocked down by half a dozen
marines and lost his money anyway so it
wasn't much use to holler about any
thing there. After being in Paris for
several days I heard a great many stor
ies of affairs at the St, Anne brig and it
got so bad the marines were relieved
from duty there, that is those that wtr-
left. For the men quite often bested the
marines and a large number of them were
missing from time to time. After the !

"Major Cappel gave a full measure of
praise to the Red Cross, which he said
furnished the men with food, clothing
anl everything else they needed.
"Major Cappel said that he had often
heard the statement made that five
Americans could whip 100 men of any
other nation, and this had been fully
demonstrated in the fighting which the
Americans had done fn the war.
"We were rushed to Chateau Thierry
and Belleau woods, the French army
was in absolute retreat, and the civilian
population in a stampede. "When we met

us to retreat and dig in. France was

T.
Th A. E. F. Mail Man.
And the mail proposition was one of
the hardest business problem the A. K.
F. had to contend with. It was the big
gest undertaking in the history of letter
writing.
When America decided to take a hand
in the war and send troops to France,
one of the things that waa overlooked in
the rush was the establishment of an
adequate military postal system. It didn't
seem to occur to anybody that the Yank
would ever find time to lay aside his gun
and take up his pen. He soon showed
that he' could write as well as he could
fight and do both at the same time.
The American soldier Is undoubtedly
the world's champion letter writer. He
would "Jot a line" or "drop a post card'
on the slightest provocation and the folks
back home wre always prompt and gen
erous with their replies.
There's an interesting story In connect
tion with the handling of the American
military mai's. which someone has called
the biggejt undertaking in the history
of letur wrin-.g."
The Postal Express Service.
I'ntil July 1. 1918. all A. E. F. mall was
handled by civilian agents of the United
Stttes postoffice department. Te did
their work well, but the difficulties
of co-ordination and liaison and the nc. d
of military knowledge soon made it ap
parent that the postal organization
should be an integral part of the aimy.
The Postal Express Service was there
fore established and took over the work
In July. 1918. Its officers and personnel,
taken from the ranks, were with rare
exceptions ao olutely unfamiliar with th.
highly specialised business of handl.nc
mail. Furthermore, the A. E. F. be

The. Court Martial System.
This brings up the much discussed
question of the army court martial sys
tem. The prisoners we had at this stock

known as "A. W. O. L.'S. mat Is they
were picked up at some place while ab
sent from their regiments without leave
and were given a trial with sentences of
from 1 month up to several years. I talk
ed with a great many of the prisoners
during the long hours of night guard duty
and found many cases or unjust punish

graduate of a Swedish ' university, told
me that he had been on the lln? for sev

he wa doing time in the stockade with
no, idea of what had happened in the

lost his mind, he said, during which time
he had been given a fair trial and was
serving six month. Another man had
been wounded and was discharged from
the hospital before his wound was prop

28 Wounds, 3 Years in France.
We also read in some of the leading
magazines anil periodicals that "Private
Chas. A. Pettit. who lives in Fanning.
Texas, Is entitled to wear 28 wound
stripes and spent 40 odd months In
France." His photograph shows a num
ber of decorations which he did not have
the authority to wear at the time this
story was written.
It is instances of this kind which cause
a doubt in the minds of most people as
to the authority any retuaW soldier has
for wearing any decoration and those
; who are really entitled to. wear them are
joint times constrained not to wear them
for fear some one might think they
did not have the authority for doing so.
Lonesomeness From No Mall.
Probably the greatest cause of trouble
among the men in the A. K. F. was lone
soinenesa.' Ard most of t'lls was caused
from not hearing from home as often as
they thought they should hear. About the
onlv thing that held the men to their
memory of home was ai; occasional letter
from some.one at home. This fact is at
tested to by tbe theme of the follow
ing lines which I received last week from
a friend of mine still in Germany:
What the Soldier Thinks.
"Do you know what a soldier thinks
about most? As hour after hour he does

"Or when he Is K. P. scrubbing pots

Service Difficulties.
At the outset the new postal depart
ment encountered many almost impas
sable difficulties in doing business in
France. Thousands of mTles from home.
It was required to serve a long line of
and British postal authorities. Ca-r-en-ter
shops were opened for Dullding e-iui-mnt
that could not be bought. New de
partments were created, new postoffhea
were established, and more and more sol
diers became mailmen. When armis
tice :wf, four months after the estab
lishment of the T. K. S.. the America,,
army in France had a mail service that
was in keeping with American military
ideals. It was doing a Ms, job in a hip
way.- In the great majority of cases the
malls were getting through and the let
ters were being delivered promptly and
satisfactorily. It was no unuh.ial tlilntr
for Garcia, and even Smith, to get letter
from home in less than t uca weeks, and
Garcia had been in a hospital twice and
Smith had belonged to three different or
ganizations. How the Letters Came.
It is interesting to rote the various
Mages through which a Tetter passed
from the sender In I'nited States to
the addressee in the trenches. The post
marked letter was forwarded to the
Chelsea Terminal in New York, to be
sorted. loaded aboard ship and started for
France. At Bordeaux. St. Natalie or
Brest It waa unloaded, sorted i:ain and
started Inland by train to the votorflc
of the region or division to which it waa
addressed.
TP to this point the letter mnv have
had a fairly successful ca-ter. b it when
trouble came it generally started here.
I rom the army postofflca Ire letter ensu

If the addressee was one of those raio
soldiers who had been continuously In
the same unit, all was will. But if
had been transferred or sent to a hospital
or his unit had suddenly decamped over
nK'ht. the chances are there wasn't a
wisp of record as to his whereabouts.
The letter would be turned back to the
Postal Express Service for dellv ry.

armies scattered over a wide area. Move
ments on a gigantic scale were being con
ducted quickly and secretly. It was not
uncommon for ten divisions to move over
night. A less difficult situation would
confront the postal authorities back home
if apme night the entire population of
Washington, D. C, were to leave for
parts unknown without telling the post
man. War time postal problems are with
out contrast In the civil establishment
during normal years.
The postal problems of the A. K. F.
were more difficult and more intricate
than those of our allies. France, at
home, operated her postal service upon
long established lines. . England, near
her home base, had short hauls and easy
communications. The postnl problems of
the Canadians and the Australians, alone
paralleled ours. But our monthly in
crease alone was greater than the entire
Canadian force.
Oreat difficulty was experienced at first
In having . the malls properly sorted in
America before being loaded alioard ship.
This was due to the fact that the postal
people in America were infanilllar with
the organization of the A. E. F.. and on
accoi-nt of the difficulties of eommunica
tion and the secrecy attached to troop
movements. Eventually it became neces
sary to send liaison officers to the postal
terminals In America to direct this work.

So a central postoffice was established
there and all mall retur.iod to tho P. E.

lean task to keep the Central Records of

jumps ahead. '
One of the most baffling problems the
C. P. O. had to contend with was the
handling of the mail of casuals and re
placements. Over 125.000 of fleets and men
came to France In casual and replace
ment units that ceased to exist as tuto-j
as they joined tlyj . E. F. These units
were broken up and the men scattired

to make directory search and readdress

mendously increased at jiu-t that period
when heavy troop movements and casu

PROBLEMS Ifl THE
OF LEVELLING SACRAME
GfbANTIG TASK
NTO HILL
In the summer of 1917 the work of
cutting down Sacramento Hill in or-j
der to take out the ore lying beneath
it was begun. By its removal a land
maik will be lost, but many million
pounds of copper will be added to the
world's supply and the Warren dis
trict will be the gainer by increased
activity in its one great .industry ,and
years added to its life.
The deposit is one requiring heavy
perliminary investment. It is prob
able that before the ore is reached, a
concentration mill erected and neces
sary additions made to the smelting
plant, five or six million dollars will
be spent, and until then little or no
copper can be sold.
Both ore bodies comprising the
known ore in Sacramento Hill were
encountered in 1910 by underground
workings projected to explore the
most favorable areas in the porphyry
intrusion. They have developed into
very large and important deposits
since then but no others have been
found. For a time exploration was
by means of underground work, but
in 1912 churn drilling began. Some
of the richer ore was mined and
shipped to the smelter, but when ex
ploration proved its importance all
underground work was stopped and
production was limited to what was
required for test purposes in the ex
perimental mill and a small quantity
of silicious ore needed by the smelter.
The west orehody is now thorough
ly explored but further drilling may
be expected to prove extensions to the
east orebody.
The ore in Sacramento Hill Is of
a variety new to the Warren district,
where almost every other ore of cop
per occurs in important quantities. It
is a disseminated ore lying in the
circular intrusion of porphyry which
was pushed up through the Dividend
Fault between the roundation and
Pinal schist on the north and the
limestones on the south. , The ore
sippears to be confined to the brec
ciated zone 1n that side of the por
phyry adjacent to the limestones. It
occurs in two bodies separated by
barren, or 'at least unprofitable,
ground.
The west orpbody; it is . figured,
contains about 7.660,000 tons of ore
carrying 2.2 per cent copper. Its
eastern part lies under the peak of
the hill 300 feet below the summit.
It extends downward 400 feet farther.
The east orebody. which has devel
oped ihout 14.000,000 tons of con
centrating ore, is somewhat better
adapted to underground mining but
it is also more favorable for open pit
work The method of working it will
not be decided upon until more in
formation is available on the results
of steam shovel work in the west ore
body. Tho 1 1 ill reaching up 300 feet above
the Wid level, will be tak-n down in
four benches, three of ( feet eBch
and one-at the top- averaging about
that, height but having a maximum
of 120 feet.
The benches will all be opened
from the south, working biick toward
the nortlt rim of the pit. The ground
Is thus broken into tho pit mid away
from the'tdepe toward Naco Koad and
the railway. They must be attached
separately, ; begLlping on the top
bench, and-the upper benches must

so that they may not b undermined
In older to reach- the top 'bench,
track wa laid on a fcrade cut out or
the hill itself. It takes two and three
quarter miles of track, most of it on a
''Vi P?r cent grade with heavy curves,
two switchbacks, and a circuit ot the
liill, to 'diuib to the top.
For a short time ground will be
removed from all four benches above
the 5360 level at once and for a con
siderable time three benches will be
working. During such times the traf
fic regulation will be very difficult.
Trains from the upper levels join
those from the lower as they go down
and all pass over the' switch at the
west end of the 5360 level before their
distribution to the dumps. From 20
to 25 trains per hour, full and empty.
must pass this point when operation
is at full capacity.
Before grading and laying tracks it
was necessary to break down the
ragged cliffs on the south side of the
hill and establish a slope on which
track grades could be maintained.
This was done by the systematic
drilling and blasting of heavy ma
chine drill holes, working up from
the bottom, until June 1, 1917, a series
of hurn drill and air drill holes con
taining about eleven tons of powder
were shot simultaneously. This made

increasing speed.
It was not realized until work was
fairly started how seriously the situ
ation of the work in the center of a
thickly populataed community would
delay progress. Track grading on the
north and east slopes of the hill had
to be done with great care to avoid
serious injury to life or property
from blasting, and took twice as long
as originally estimated.
The ore varies greatly in copper
contents -and several hundred thou
sand tons will go directly to the
smelter. It is an ore very favorable
to concentration and. will give a high
percentage of recovery.

PH0CESS1
OF
LOWERED COSTS
In spite of the fact that the Na
tional Industrial Conference Board
reports that the cost of living has
gone down since the armistice was
signed, copper miners of the south
west have reason to feel that the pro
duct of their work has not taken its
proper place in the procession. ,
The miner feels that his produce,
which, during the war. was held down
by tho government to 26 cents, took
its tumble too fast when it dropped
off all at once to loss than 15 cents,
a drop of almost 50 per cent. For
tunately, the mine operators did not
reduce wages in the same proportion.
v.-Bges for miners dropping from $6.10
per day to ?5.10, or about 16 per cent.
Nevertheless. the break had to
come some place, and coming, as it
did. in a taw material like copper,
will eventually have its ntfect on the
whole market. The effect on tho
miner directly is almost nil. but after
the ore which he has produced has

NEW YORK Negotiations for the!
sale of a large amount of conner tnl
Germany are in progress, and it is
expected that they will be concluded h
in a rew days throueh renrespntativea'
of German bankers and the Copper j
Export Association. The only quec-'
tion is the establishment here of a1
sufficient credit for Germany to make
the purchase. The vice-president ot
a prominent trust comoanv said to
day that his institution was willfn!?'
to go into a $260,000,000, syndicate to;
mane me necessary advance.
It is probable that within the next'
week such a credit will be tentatively
arranged. It will not be used, how
ever, for the purchase of copper alone,
but for foodstuffs and other necessi
ties as well. The banking operations!
win, or course, be contingent upon
tne approval of the President and
tne secretaries of State and Treasury.

NEW YORK Strength continues ;
to be shown in the copper market, but'
all sales are smaller in volume. This
is due almost entirely to a tendency
by some sellers to decline business
except from their regular customers.
One agency recently turned down an
inquiry for 1.000,000 pounds for Sep-!
tember delivery. Quotations are
about unchanged with spot and July
metal at 22c per pound, August ship
ments 22 l-4c and September gen
erally. 22 l-2c, although some of the
sellers are holding for 23c per pound
for the last mentioned month. Large
inquiries are in the market, accord

Ancient Indian Drawings on rocks in Tucson Mountain Range visited by
Goodrich Rubber Co., scout car party.
This is a picture of an aboriginal
signboard. The artist was an Indian
and be and bis crew lived a thousand
years ago, more or leB3. It is one of
the signboards which are found on
the mountain trails of the good hunt
ing country of Arizona, and is chipped
inio boulders. Scientists call It a
pttroglyph.
Honest, none of the archaeologists
know what the significance of the
drawing is so that your guess is as
good as theirs, and the guesses range
all the way from the record of a
mighty hunter to the slate scrawls of
the tribal boys whiling away an, idle
afternoon. .
A party in a Goodrich Rubber com

Rocks on a trip through Arizona and
considered it of sufficient interest to
present to the reading public. These
are pictures of mountain sheep, al
though they are usually called goats,
and it is plain that they ranged in
greater numbers than they do now.

The Picture Rocks of Tucson are
located thirteen and one-half miles
northwest ' of the city by the old
Yuma trail, now called the. Silver
Bell road, and up into the hills ot
the Tucson mountain range for a
mile. They are right beside a well
traveled road and are easiest to
reach of several such petroglyphs 1b
the vicinity of Tucson. A run over
this picturesque desert road to the
Picture Rocks makes an interesting
afternoon excursion. y
The durability of the drawings is
due to the chyping away of the dark
colored outer rock, showing "the white
rock below, the chipping probably
having been done with flint or basalt
tools. Other pictures on the boulder
are the coiled snakes which may have
meant either water or danger; the
sun, and certain ritualistic markings.

SPOKANE, Wash., July 26. With
new fires springing up in western
Montana and nothern Idaho and the
supply of labor rapidly being drain
ed, the forest fire situation has reach
ed a stage where, according to state
ments today, it excites serious alarm
on the part of federal forest service
officials. Three new fires were re
ported in the Lolo national forest,
three in the Missoula forest, and 12
in the Clearwater forest, while fires
that have been burning for weeks
continue to threaten.
The aid of soldiers In fighting the
forest fires has been asked by the
Montana state council of defense.
High winds, according to reports to
the council of defense, have fanned
the forest blazes to a stretch which
makes their control by present
forces, tired out by weeks of duty,
problematical.
The joining of the Cold Creek fire
with the blaze coming down Long
Gulch creek, in the Lolo forest, caus
ed a fire which spread in three di
rections at a dangerous pace, though
it was temporarily, checked when it
reached the old Black Tail burn.
The Hughes creek fire in the Bit
ter Root forest jumped the control
lines several times. Although the
flames are being held on the south
side of the creek, this is one of the
biggest fires of the district.
The Running creek fire has clear
ed the Salmon mountains, jumped in
to Montana, and is burning over a
large area.
Large crews are fighting the Evaro
fire and are holding the blaze on the
west side.

region of the kitchen and the hosts
informed the guests that the waiters
had gone on a strike and they would
have to do the serving. . Each guest
ordered from the menu before her
plate and great was the surprise and
merrtment when it was discovered

Mr. Grant believes that the destruc
tion of life of the blondes in the pres
ent war has been so Immensely great
er than that of the brunettes, that a
great step has been taken in wiping
out of the blonde type.
"The world war will leave Europe
much poorer In Nordic blood," he
says.
He points out how the blonde race
has been absorbed by the brunette all
over the world, and cites the Ayran
conquerors of northern India, who
imposed their language and customs
on the natives,-but were swallowed
up in the darker stream of blood.
He thinks that the same thing will
happen in the United States, and
that the only hope of a relatively pure
type of blonde community is in north
west Canada, which because of its
climate is suitable for the blonde
types and unsuitable for the bru
nettes. CHRISTIAN CHURCH.

FOUND GUILTY
After being out all night deliberat
ing on the verdict in the case of the
StHte vs. Clyde Crossland and Tom
Reed, chnrgod with the statutory
crime of rape, the jury returned into
court before noon yesterday with a
verdict of guilty for Crossland and
acquitted Reed, who w?.s immediately
freed from custody. While the trial
was 'conducted behind closed doors,
it appears from evidence simmering
out of the court room that Crossland
was responsible for th whole atfak
in which the two girls involved were
held at Naco and allowed to be vio
lated by a number 01' negro soldiers
stationed at Xaco. The evidence
showed conclusively, according to a i
statement of one of the juror, that;
Itee'd was taken into the affair by-!
Crossland after the deed had been
committed and was not guilty of the
alleged crime. Sentence on Cross
land' was deferred to a later date by
Judge Lockwood.
Yesterday morning there were two
sections of the superior court in pes
sion. Judge Lockwood holding out in
the chambers, where he disposed of
a number of probate, civil and law
and motion matters, while Judge A.
G. McAlister, of Graham county, oc
cupied the bench in the court room,
hearing the case of the State vs. Ce
cil Adams and wife, in which the de
fendants were found guilty by the
jury shortly after the noon hour, of
Violating the city ordinance No. 173!
