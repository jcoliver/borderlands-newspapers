Quotations on Steel Too High
Declares Hines; Peek De
nounces Director's Attitude
(By Review Leased Wire)
WASHINGTON, April 10 President
Wilson will be appealed to by cable to
'take a band In the controversy be
tween the railroad administration and
the department of commerce's Indus
trial board which was brought to a
head late today by the definite and
final refusal of Director General Hines
to accept the new steel price schedule
approved by the board after confer
ence with the steel industry.
This announcement was made In a
statement issued for the industrial
board by its chairman, George N.
Peek, after the director general had
made public his final decision. The
opening break between the two gov
ernment agencies, came after Mr.
Hines and Chairman Peek had con
ferred for about an hour.
Mr. Hines based his refusal to ac
cept the price on the grounds that
the prices were "too high;" that the
industrial had no power to im
pose its schedule on the railroad ad
ministration and that the restoration
of industry to a peace basis "would
be retarded" if a governmental agency
were bound by the board's recommen
dations. ,
Peek Denounces Hines
In a statement denouncing the atti
tude of the railroad administration
in which it was asserted "the govern
ment is exhibited as setting up an in
dustrial policy with one hand and de
stroying . it with another," Chairman
Peek warned against the railroad ad
ministration's exercise of its power of
monopolistic buying" of rails, and de
clares that "the director general must
assume full responsibility for all tne
results of the course he has chosen."
"After repeated consideration of the
steel and iron prices proposed by the
industrial board," said a statement by
Mr. Hines, "I am still of the opinion
that those prices are too high and
therefore that the railroad administra
tion cannot approve them as being rea
sonable prices.
" Seek Fair Prices
"To the extent that the railroad ad
ministration finds - it necessary to
make purchases it will continue to
make them on the best terms obtain
able by fair and Justifiable methods,
with full recognition of the principle
that a government agency with large
purchasing'power must be particularly
careful not even to attempt action
which could be regarded as oppres
sive.
"The object of the railroad admlnls
tration throughout ha9 been to obtain
a fair and reasonable price level. It
has never contemplated that it should
get a lower price level than the gen
eral public.
"If the industrial board can assist in
bringing about levels of prices at
which the railroad administration will
feel justified in Duying us co - opera -
tion will be welcomed.
Recounting the history of, the nego
tiations Mr. Hinee stated that his
counsellors agreed unanimously- that
the Industrial boards steel prices were
too high.

PARIS, April 10 (By the Associat

Presbyterian Minister Held on
Charge of Aiding the
Korean Revolt
(By Review Leased Wire)
WASHINGTON. April 10. The
state department has been advised of
the arrest of the Rev. Eli Miller How
ry,, a Presbyterian missionary at
Pyengyang, Korea, on a charge pre
ferred by the Japanese author it v that
he was aiding and abetting the Ko
rean independence propagandists.
It was explained by a high official
of the state department that the Rev
erend Mowry if he had actually en
gaged in political activities in Ko
rea, would be amendable under the
Japanese laws and that the only pos
sible action by the United States
would be to see that he received a
fair trial, and that ten finding of the
court waB not unjust.
Korea, being under Japanese rule,
it was explained that an American
citizen in that country was in the
same position in respect to Japanese
laws that a Japanese would be in the
Philippines under the laws of the
United folates governing :'thosel isl
ands. Information to the state de
partment as to alleged activities of
American missionaries has been
measrer.
Although it is understood the Jap
anese press have made charges, some
of them of serious import, against the
missionaries, it is not believed from
the information that has been received
that these charges are true. All ad
vices are said to have indicated that
the missionaries have kept apart from
the independence movement.

Indications in Paris Point to
Extra Session Ready to
Act on Measure June First
President Believed Worried'
Over Critical Situation in!
America; Ready to Return'
PARIS, April 10. (By the Associat
ed Press.) While the session of the ;
council of four are occupying the chief
attention of President Wilson yet,
those close to the president who have
seen him in recent days say he is giv
ing serious consideration to the con
dition of public affairs in the United
States, particularly the situation cre
ated" by the failure of appropriation
bills and the necessity for calling an
extra session of congress.
It is known that some of the presi
dent's advisers are of the opinion that
a call should be issued at a very early
date! so as to permit the new congress
to assemble in perfect organization by
June 1 and, complete the appropria
tion bills before the end of the fiscal
year. Should this prevail, it would
require an early call in order to per
mit the usual period for assembling,
but is is not known that it will pervail,
for while the president is listing to
these counsels, he has given no inti
mation of the course he Intends to
pursue.
New Factors
Several new factors have recently
entered into the consideration of this
subject here. One Is the departure of
the military committee of the new
congress for Europe and It is fore
seen that the committee, which is
chiefly interested in the appropriation
bills cannot make the visit and get
back much before June.
Another phase is the conclusion that
the usual method of extending appro
priation beyond June 30 by concurrent
resolution of congress would not suf
fice In the present case, as conditions
are so entirely changed from a war
to a peace basis that the former ap
propriations are not applicable to the
present conditions. This, it is believ
ed .will make necessary entirely new
appropriation bills, requiring consider
able time for their detailed elabora
tion. The fact that the United States
transport George Washington has been
ordered to proceed to Brest has given
rise to the suggestion that it was the
situation at home, rather than in Eu
rope, which might require the early
return of President Wilson to America.
' Date Not Settled
But, according to the view of those
in the confidence of the president, hi3
physical presence in Washington is
not essential to the meeting of con
gress or until the end cf June, when
onnronr'stion bi'ls w'll b reTlv for
j issued here and the worv of the new
congress can proceed without the pres
ident's attendance.
It is pointed out that President W'l
son could revert to the custom of his
1 predecessors ln issuine cTs and trans-
mitt'ng messages, without his persona
presence.
The final decision denends largely
on the progress of the peice confer
ence, as the situations at Washington
and Paris are so linked together that
they are more or less dependent on
each other.
President Wilson attended the
morning and afternoon sessions of the
council today. The council had under
consideration the remaining details of
the Sarre settlement and the Rhine
frontier.
There were reports that the Italians
were disposed to accept the plan for
the Adriatic settlement, which had not
previously been satisfactory to them.
Should this comprise be effected, it
would remove one of the last large ob
stacles of the consummation of the
1 treaty .though many lesser subjects

DELEGATES SPLIT
OVER COAL FIELDS
Teschen Fuel District . Pre
sents Big Problem in
Peace Conference '.
PARIS, Wednesday, April 9. The
coal fields of the Teschen district in
dispute between Czecho-Slovakia and
Poland present one of the most diffi
cult problems before the peace confer
ence. Both nationalities claim that
the dlstritc is essential to their devel
opment. Of the total population of
600,000 about one-third are Czecho-
Slovaks and the remainder are Poles,!
but if the district were divided on '
racial lines the industrial district and ,
the railways would be split so as to
be of little value to either country.
The Teschen mines are declared to
provide the only - cooking coal avail
able for Czecho-Slovakia and conse
quently her Industries cannot live
without them, her representatives
claim. Warsaw is supplied with gas
from tie Teschen fields and is de
pendent upon them for the light, heat
and power for the city. Poland, it is
stated, has other coking coal fields,
but has not developed them.
The peace conference commission
on Polish affairs and the inter-allied
commission sent to Poland have been
working hard in an endeavor to ar
range some plan which will make the
Teschen coal available for both, coun
tries, but neither the Poles nor the
Czechc-Slovaks have shown them
selves willing to accept a compromise
which would deprive them of the own
ership of the coal fields.

PARIS, Friday, April 11. Geneva,
Switzerland, has been chosen as the
jSeat of the league of nations, accord
ing to announcement here.
PARIS, April 1C (By the Associat
ed Press.) The league of nations
commission adopted tonight a new
section to the covenant, specifically
providing that the Monroe doctrine is
not affected by the provisions of the
covenant.
LONDON, April 10. (By the Asso
ciated Press) The national executive
of the labor party at a meeting today
formulated a statement of policy de
manding that the Paris conference put
an end to the protracted discussions
and make peace in accordance with
President Wilson's 14 points.
The labor party also demands the
withdrawal of the consumption bill,
the cessation of military interference
ln Russia and tne speedy withdrawal
from that country of British troops.
PARIS, April 10. (By the Associat
ed Press.) The plenary session of
th jepeace conference tomorrow for
consideration of the labor report is
awaited with much interest because
of the dissatisfaction existing among
the smaller nations. Indications are
that there may be interpellations con
cerning the secrecy which the big four
is surrounding Itself and rumors that
negotiations may open with the Ger
mans without fully advising all the
peace delegations of the terms of the
treaty. Without exception the smaller
nations ar esaid to be displeased at
being kept in the dark.
The labor report is to be presented
fo ropen discussion and consequently
there will be opportunity for general
debate unless steps are taken to pre
vent it.
The council of four is strongly op
posed to official publication of the
peace treaty before its submission
to the Germans. It maintains that
it is allowing positive decisions to be
announced and hat consequently the
public will be advised on all the main
points before the treaty is signed.
This piece meal and incomplete pub
lication is unsatisfactory to many of
the delegates .who are urging that the
r.eople of the allied countries should
have the text of the peace treaty from
thei rofficial3 before the Germans an
nounce it with their interpretations.

Labor Leader Bursts Into
Tears as He Sets Foot
on Native Shore
' (By Review Leased "Wire) .
NEW YORK, April 10 Samuel
Gompers, president of the American
Federation, came ashore tonight from
the steamship Rotterdam, which
brought him back from France with
the other members of the American
delegatio nto the International labor
conference which framed a covenant
to govern the affairs of labor through
out the world.
The veteran labor leader had ex
pected to spend the night aboard the
ship, which will not dock until morn
ing, but came back on the cutter with
immigration officials when informed
by two of his sons that his wife was
ill and that he should see her as soon
as possible. They did not tell him
that their mother had suffered a par
alytic stroke several days ago.
When Mr. Gompers set foot in tlto
darkness ofltji econcrete of Battery
pier, he asked:
"Is this terra firma or a bridge?"
When assured that it was the south
end of. Manhattan island, he burst
into tears, exclaiming:
"My own land. Thank God!..
Mr. Gompers was ill when he board
ed the ship at Plymouth, but his
health improved greatly during the
voyag and he was able to make three
patriotic addresses to the 2238 troops
and the 570 civilians on board. In his
last talk he denounced vigorously the
remarks made through an interpreter
by G. Zilbourg, secretary of war in
the Kerensky cabinet in Russia.
The labor leader declared the Rus
sian had shown pronounced bolshevik
tendencies and as a consequence im
migration authorities decided tonight
to hold Zilbourg at Ellis island for
further investigation.
Mr. Gompers declined to discuss his
mission abroad, but he might make a
statement tomorrow.

Threats of General Mutiny

(By Review Leased Wire)
WASHINGTON, April 10. The war
department issued tonight an official
statement confirming Associated
Press advices from Archangel that
what amounted to a mutiny occurred
among the American troops there on
March 30. A company of infantry, the
message stated, refused to entrain for

so by Col. George E. Stewart, com
manding the American contingent.
Open threats were made of general
mutiny unless definite statement from
Washington insuring early withdrawal
was forthcoming.

certain military information not hear

"The non-commissioned officer who
was in charge of the packing soon re
ported to the officers that the men re
fused to obey. At this, some of the
officers took charge and all except one
man began reluctantly to pack after a
considerable delay. The soldier who
continued to refuse was placed in con
finement. Colonel Stewart, having
been sent for. arrived and had the
men assembled to talk with them.
"Upon the condition that the pris
oner above mentioned was releasea
the men agreed to go. This was done
aud the company then proceeded to
the railroad station and entrained
there for tne front. That they would
not go to the front line positions was

they would only gO' to Obozerskaya.
They also stated that general mutiny

Lieut. Lewis Douglas Joins
Warren District Club;
Final Workout Today
Lieut. Lewis Douglas, son of James
S. Douglas, will work out today with
the Warren district baseball team,
preparatory to joining with the local
sluggers in their game Saturday with
the Chicago Nationals. Douglas will
come here from his home in Douglas
for the first workout with the locals
at 2 o'clock this afternoon. . He will
hold down either the. first or third
sack for a part of the Warren park
exhibition.
Douglas has returned within the
past few weeks from a long period ot
service with the United States army
in France, where he was closely in
touch with soldiers' sports. He is n
former college star of eastern schools,
and was at one time well known in
collegiate baseball circles. While he
declares he has played little baseball
in tn- past three years, his activities
in in my sports contradict h-is back
wardness in admitting his ability, ana
local stars are anticipating a valuable
addition to their staff.
A complete list of players who win
arrive here tonight with the Cubs was
yesterday received in Bisbee by Man
ager G. D. Pitman of the local outfit
from Secretary J. O. Seys of the Cubs.
Here's how they will stack up:
Flack or Barber, rt.; Hollocher, ss.l

Tick or Deal, 3b; Lear or Kilduff, 2b;
Killifer, O'Farrell, Daly, c; Alexander,
Vaughn, Tyler, Douglas, Hendrix,
Weaver, Carter, Martin, p.; McCabe,
infielder, and Letter, outfielder, are
extra player.
In addition to the star players the
following noted sport writers will accompany-
the team, representing Chi
cago papers:
James. Crusinberry. Tribune;
Charles Dryden. Herald-Examiner; u.
C Reichow. Daily News; Harry Neily,
American; Malcolm MacLean, Post.
This afternoon all players of the lo
cal organization will have their final
workout before the clash. Yesterday
the members of the team spent five
hours on the diamond, closing their
practice with a seven-inning game
with the Bisbee high school team.
We have the classiest team ever
organized in this district since the
death of the old Cactus league,' 'de-

Men From Michigan
The dispatch today did not show
to what extent bolshevik! propagand
ists could be held responsible for the
behavior of the troops, nor has any
information reached the department
tending to show the extent to which
the rebellious attitude may have
spread through the whole American
contingent. '
The 339th Infantry of the 85th Di
vision forms the bulk of the American
contingent in the Archangel region.
The unit is almost wholly composed of
selective service men from Michigan.
It is commanded by Col. George E.
Stewart of the regular army, who
served in some of the most northerly
posts in Alaska and became thorough
ly familiar with weather conditions
such as those at Archangel.
While the action of the company at
Archangel undoubtedly is mutinous
under any strict interpretation of the
military code and would render the
men liable to severe disciplinary ac
tion under ordinary circumstances,
war -department officials did not be
lieve such action would result. It was
pointed out that the men apparently
obeyed their . orders subsequently
when the situation had been made
clear to them. Only in the event of a
refusal which jeopardized the lives of
other men, it was thought, would. any
drastic measures of discipline be in
voked. Officers here were frankly
doubtful that public sentiment at
home would permit any other course

Be Careful in Use of
Cosmetics, Says Beauty
- - - - 'A ri$ . : 4 II
I ' '' ' ' w-' - , - - ' tf-'-i IT-T0?"!
By Edith Hyde
"The Girl of the Golden Apple"
Can a woman attain beauty by
the use of cosmetics?
Certainly it is always a wom
an's duty, to look her best to be
beautiful If possible and it is
sometimes necessary to assist na
ture a bit in this direction.
The beauties of the oriental
harems were perhaps the origin
ators of the use of cosmetics. But
while they adopted these artifi
cial methods of improving or en
hancing beauty, they have never
Jeopardized health and beauty it--self
by using a coating of enam
els and paints such as the sup
posedly more "civilized" women
of the Occident have done.
The oriental woman will make
a very simple and effective
rouge from the petals of damask
roses, crushed In white-wine
vinegar. Another method they use
is to dip crimson silk in spirits of
wine and rub upon the cheeks,
chin and ears.
Ifc requires an artist's hand to
put cosmetics on effectively. .The
average woman will do well to
confine herself to the smallest
possible amount of ronge lipstick
or eyebrow pencil.
Many preparations are very
dangerous; some are absolutely
poisonous. Before using any cos
metic, the user should know ex
actly what it contains. Paints in
jure the skin and age it rapidly.

For the lips, a "stick" composea
of cocoa butter and wax as a base,
to which has been added oil of
sweet almonds, honey of roses,
and glycerine, and a coloring mat
ter of carmine or eosine to make
It more or less pink, is about a
good as any.
A woman who thinks one

the preparations she uses it she
would be safe.

PUT STOMACH IN
FINE CONDITION
Says Indigestion Results From an Ex
cess of Hydrochloric Acid
in Stomach
Undigested food delayed in tho
stomach decays, or rather ferments
the same as food left in the open air,
says a noted authority. He also tells
cs that indigestion is caused by Hy
peracidity, meaning there is an ex
cess of hyprochloric acid in the stom
ach, which prevents complete diges
tion and starts food fermentation. This
everything eaten soure in the stomach
much like garbage sours in a can,
forming acid fluids and gases which
inflate the stomach like a toy balloon.
Then we feel a belch up of gas, we
erucate sour food or have heartburn,
flatulence, water brash or nausea.
Coupled with this condition of the
stomach a case neglected and a
chronic case of constipation and you
have the worst enemy known to man
kind. In a case of this sort it is best tq
take a Laxcarin tablet twice a day,
morning and at night, until the entire
condition is remedied. The remedy
ing of a condition of this sort usually
depends upon the length of time the
person has been suffering from indi
gestion or constipation. Because one
can expect to remedy abnormal condi
tion .which has probably been lasting
for years within a few weeks. How
ever, it is safe to say that almost im
mediate relief is experienced directly
after taking Laxcarin for a few days.
While relief follows usually the first
tablet or two, it is essential to keep
up the treatment to neutralize the
acidity, remove the gas making mass,
start the liver, stimulate the kidneys
and thus promote a free flow of pure
digestive Juice.
Laxcarin is very inexpensive and it
is made out of pure vegetable herbs.
It is absolutely harmless and it is used
by a great many people. It's formula
is not a secret to the medical world in
general as a matter of fact it is be
ing used by thousands and thousands
of physicians . in daily everyday life.
This harmless preparation is used by
a great many people for stomach
trouble and constipation. Laxcarin is
6old exclusively by the Laxcarin Pro
ducts company, Dept. E-52, Pittsburg,
Pa. Price for full treatment of six
boxes only $5. One box only costs 1,
but it is worth a million to sufferers
as it relieves them so well, and - it
works as & clock. Ad-.

Delusive Promises to the Filipinos
Secretary Baker, in approving in general terms the demand for
Philippine independence, says that the only link between the islands
and the United States Is now "the American Governor General and the
most binding of ties, that of affection." This i3 very much like saying
that Eunker Hill monument rests upon nothing but its foundation and
the admiration of the people. The admiration of the people would not
keep the niqnument in iu place, but its foundation does.. The ties of
their affection would not bind the Filipinos to the United States for the .
space of five minutes, but the Governor General, representing the bene
volent mandate, of the United States, will bind them just as long as
the United States desires. -
President Wilson tells the Filipino commission that he hopes that .
their visit will result in bringing about the desired) ends set forth in
the joint resolution of the legislature sending the commission to the
United States." This is not a flat-footed declaration. It sounds very
much as if the president, like Secretary Baker, wanted to say something
that he could easily get out of afterward. But as the resolution in ques
tion pointed to Philippine independence, the president's remark must
point in the same direction. It Is an invitation to the Filipinos to de
clare their separation.
But the president has absolutely no power to promise the Filipinos
Independence, and he does nothing but .mischief in promising it. He
knows well enough that the congress whose power will continue until
his term expires will not sever the tie of the islands to be United States.
All that he does or can do by this announcement, therefore, is to invite
rebellion in the Philippines.
Again the Plea of General Wood
General Pershing not so many years ago meditated retiring from the
army because "there would not be another war for TOO years and
soldiering offers no career for a man." That idea was coddled by
enormous numbers of American. It was held up to the very moment that
war was forced upon us in 1917: Colonel Roosevelt and Major General
Leonard Wood were held up to scorn as cranks by those who could not
see the possibilities of our going to war nor the necessity for preaching
preparedness.
But we had to go to- war, and bitter, indeed, is the knowledge which
we now have that w-e paid for our lack of preparedness a needlessly
heavy price in American lives. Up to the time of his death Colonel
Roosevelt preached preparedness, despite the fact that the great war
had been won by U3. Still there were scoffers.
General Wood today is urging as earnestly as ever he did a system
of universal training for national defense. Do we hear "pooh poohs," in
Tesponse to his references to "the next war?" Unhappily we do. Some
people learn very slowly of do not learn at all. Yet there can be no
successful denial of the following deliverance of General Wood before
the Kansas legislature at Topeka:
"The prediction that there will be no more war is as old as time,
but war is like a pestilence. It comes 'unawares and the most demo
cratic method for a nation like ours is to be prepared."
Southern Anti-Wilsonism
What Joseph W. Bailey of Texas has to say about Mr. Wilson comes
from a source that gives it significance. It comes from a -citizen of a
state which cast about 77 per cent of its total vote in the Wilson column
in 1916; its writer represented this state for two terms in the senate and
was by no means noted for conservatism himself.
When a Southerner of long senatorial experience breaks with the'
president whom the South bore, twice elected and has flourished under
as never before, we may talk of portents. The defection of Senator
Reed of Missouri may have caused more stir, for Reed is actually a mem
ber of the senate. But Missouri does not belong to the Solid South, while
Lailey's state does, and indeed has outdone many sister states of that
block in the thoroughness of her Wilsonlsm. Thus the Texan's defection
has a peculiar significance.
Socialism is a hard word to apply to the views of President Wilson,
Mr. Bailey applies it, with particulars' which he presents as corroborative:
Coming from a Southern conservative of the colonel type, the attacfc
would cause less surprise. Coming from a man of strong radical lean
ings, who is a Southerner as well, it lays bare the extent to which dis
satisfaction has penetrated among Mr. Wilson's former supporters.
Sacred Cows
Is a cow sacred? It is wrong to kill a cow?
These questions look silly to us, here in this country.
In a libel suit now on in London, it is brought out, however, that
millions of human beings look on the cow as sacred.
Bal Tilak, a Brahmin, is suing for libel. He charges Sir V. Chirol
in a book called "Indian Unrest" did him wrong.
Tilak, it seems, started an Anti-Cow Killing society in India, to
protect the life of cows, and teach that it is wrong to kill cows. The
book libelled him, he charges, because it insinuated the Anti-Cow Killing
society was carrying on a propaganda against Hindoos and Mohamme
dans. Bal Tiiak testified it is . solemn tradition among millions of Hindoos
that the cow is an animal of holiness and it is a. violation of religion to
put a cow to death.
So it goes. Half the world does not know how the other half lives.
How far would one of these Hindoos get if he went to a big stock
yard in an American, city and preached, "The cow is a blessed and su
perior creature. Live on rice. Let beefsteak alone. Be kind to the
cow. Do not kill it."
Time to Push Business
This is not a time for either pessimism cr unreasoning optimism. We
shall get safely back to a normal peace bads, but only as the best brains
and brawn of the country approaches the problem in a spirit of fairness,
moderation and calmness. Men of affairs in all departments of activity
owe it to their country to give the best that is in them during the critical
reconstruction period. The young men of the Army, and Navy have done
their bit, and it now remains for the older men to safeguard the country
in peace as our victorious armies did in time of war. This dees not
call for heroic or sensationalism, but oniy that each man stick close to
his business and leave as little as possible to irresponsible fcubordinates.

FLOATING MINES IN
DARDANELLES STILL
MENAGETO VESSELS
Several Craft Lost Since Arm
istice Was Signed Through
Hitting Bombs
CONSTANTINOPLE, March 9.
(Correspondence of the Associated
Press.) Floating mines in the Dar
danelles and Sea of Marmora still con
stitute great danger to navigation.
Several ships have been lost since the
armistice through mine explosions.
The armistice required Turkey to
indicate all mines, but it has not been
possible in all cases to give their ex
act position. Mine-sweepers have been
at work for soma time, but naval au
thorities say it will be many months
before vessels can proceed through the
straits with safety. No navigation is
permitted at night. On passenger ves
sels lifeboat drills are held regularly,
Just as in days when submarines men
aced the seas.
Even in the broad stretches of the
Aegean sea the greatest precautions
are taken against floating mines. In
certain areas passengers are required
to wear life preservers, and narrow
lanes of travel have been marked out
for pilots to follow.
But it is in the Black sea that the
greatest danger exists. Not only are
there numerous floating mines there,
but extensive unmarked mine fields
laid indiscriminately by the Germans,
Russians and bolsheviki. They are a
constant menace to shipping. The
steamer bearing. thfl American Red
Cross mission to "Rumania narrowly
missed a floating mine while proceed
ing to Constanza. Often these mines
are carried down by the swift current
in the Bosphorous straits to the Sea
of Marmora, where they are an ever
present danger to the hundreds of
naval and merchant vessels.
Naval authorities say it will be sev
eral years before the waters of Europe
are entirely free of floating mines.
Many of the German mines destroyed
by allied trawlers were found to have
been moored by rope. When the rope
rotted the mines broke from their
anchorages and drifted in many, cases
to the main line of steamer travel.

SENATORS OPPOSING
LEAGUE WILL REGRET
IT, SAYSSEN. SMITH
Many Who Signed Promise to
Vote Against Pact Already
Changing Minds
"I firmly believe that the peace
treaty and league of nations will be
ratified by the United States," de
clared Senator Marcus A. Smith of
Arizona in an address yesterday noon
before the Warren District Luncheon
club. "Of course there will be small
amendments, changes demanded be
cause of hypocritical attacks on the
league plan, but the plan will be ratified."
Senator Smith was a guest of the
Luncheon club, coming here from his
home in Tucson to meet his friends
of pioneer days. With him as guests
of the club were also Maj. James S.
Douglas of Jerome, recently with the
American Red Cross in France, his
son, Lieut. Lewis Douglas, and Archi
bald Douglas, chief of counsel for
United Verde Extension Mining com
pany, of New York. Senator Smith,
Major Douglas and Senator Fred Sut
ter of Bisbee were speakers at the
luncheon.
Senator Smith prefaced his remarks
with a few words of greeting to the
residents of this district, frienca
"whose faces I have known for years
and through whose faces I can see the
shadow faces of those who have pass
ed away." He deplored the tendency
of senators and congressmen in gen
eral to. waste time in making useless
addresses, and regretted the filibuster
which at the close of congress held
up so much, necessary legislation. ,
America Premier Nation
Senator Smith 6poke eagerly on the
subject of the league of nations. The
United States, he declared, ha3 . be
come the premier nation of the world,
and when the armistice was signed
the United States had ready for action
either in this country or in Europe
15,000,000 of the finest fighting men
the world has ever seen. From a na-
' tion divided from the world, self-centered
and alone in its hemisphere, the
United States has emerged from the
war the leader of the world; a coun
try looked on by the other countries of
the globe with favor and deference; a
leader in militarism, commerce and
civilization.
"Our president was elected on the
platform of 'He Kept Us Out of War","
the senator continued, "and he woula
have kept us out of war to this day
if the world would have permitted.
Finally when we realized that we
must enter the war to stay the steel
spur of the Hun, we plunged into the
conflict in full earnest.
Did we go across there for the fun
of killing a few Huns? Did we spill
the blood and sacrifice the lives of
200,000 fine American youths for the
sport of. it? Did we send our money
and provisions and workers to Europe
just for the excitement we could get
out of it?
Perpetual Peace is Object
"We went over there to fight the
barbarous Hun, to save the world from
domination by the hordes of the
kaiser. And now that the fighting is
over and the armistice is signed, out
president has gone over there to
make, if possible, the peace of the
world perpetual, to bring about an
amalgamation of the nations of the
world through' which future conflicts
will be prevented."
The senator spoke of the opposition
to the league of nations. He can un
derstand, he declared, why such a man
as Senator Reed of Missouri can op
pose the league, because he is opposed
to any league. But he cannot under
' stand what other senators, especially
those who signed the round-table
against the league, can hope to gain
through their actions.
"Human nature is a hard thing to
understand," said Senator Smith. "We
find its expressions in so many char
acteristic poses that we sometimes
become puzzled. Any hobby, or habit,
can become harmful. Why! A man
can eat beefsteak until it harms him!
And when a mi becomes so satur
ated with politics that he loses sight
and thought of his country and the
interests of his nation, we must regret
it. These senators- who signed that
document not to vote for the league,
permeated at the time with politics,
are now beginning to realize their mis
takes. Many of them are already
seeking for the opportunity to grasp
bold of some minor amendment which
will permit them to retract."
The league of nations plan has no
adverse effect on the United States'
Monroe doctrine, declared the senator,
but extends to the entire world the
purposes of that doctrine, which was
made to prevent wars on this conti
nent. Amendments Certain
"To be sure the league plan will be
amended," Senator Smith declared.

Windy City Thinks Jts Hoo
doo in Swimming Con
tests Is Broken
(By- Review Leased Wire)
CHICAGO, April 10. One of
the mysteries of the swimming
world is the fact that Chicago has
never produced a championship
woman swimmer, despite its many
facilities for the sport.
But now Chicago thinks the
hcodoo is about to be broken.
Swimming enthusiastics of the
Windy City' are claiming that on
form, Miss Emma Sikking ought
to be an easy winner in the cham
pionship contests. next summer.
. Miss Sikking is one of the Illi- 5
noi3 Athletic club's team of four,
who will compete in the women's
contests. ' She is also a member
Of the North Side Swimming club
of Chicago and of the water polo
team now playing for a film com
pany. Her home is in Springfield, 111.,
where she started her professional
career as instructor at the Y. W.
C. A. tank.
"Hypocritical attacks made on. the
document by its opponents have made
this necessary that some of its clauses
may be more intelligible to those who
criticize them, and that a few of them
may become easier of interpretation."
In closing the senator painted a
word picture of the United States, the
leading nation of the world Upholding
the peace of.tfie world, and of Ari
zona, the leading state of the nation
in all patriotic calls, retaining its
place In the country's roll of honor.
Major Douglass "presume'd," as he
stylo it, to select from Senator Smith's
talk, the topic- for his few words.
Senator Smith had declared that ad
verse and bitter, hypocritical criticism
of the government should not be toler
ated. Major Douglas called attention
to the fact that many mistakes have
been made in the United States' con
duct of the war. These mistakes, he
said, should be bared to the public,
and constructive criticism which will
make the public see and understand
past mistakes, should be encouraged.

If the soldiers of the United States,

States have a erodes aeainaf th
army, although it is hard to determine
just wnat the grudge Is and why it
has sprung up, declares Lieutenant
Douglas. Their experiences in the.
army have not been exceedingly pleas-
am. un uecemDer 11, one month after
tne signing of the armistice, the mo
rale of the army was 100 per cent
worse than on November 11, says the
lieutenant. This fact is accounted for
in that no preparations had been made
for peace, the men had been occu
pied with fighting and learning the
lessons of war, and were suddenly
let down with nothing to do. The re
sult was almost demoralizing, and of
ficers were entirely unprepared for
the emergency.'
These experiences of the KnMfpra
must not be put behind them, declares
Lieutenant Douglas, before their or
ganizations in this country will reach
the maximum of efficiency. The ques
tion of military training for American
youth must be presented to them from
educational and physical aspects be
fore they will grasp and further the
poliqy, and they must be assured that
the country will have a general staff
and military oreanization in whkh
they can see assurance of future pre
paredness, before they will become
acutely active in their new organiza
tions. When this time comes the
soldiers' council will be one of the
greatest factors in the nation, he be
lieves. Meantime, the peqple of this coun
try have two great tasks ebforethem in
assisting the soldiers to attain an or
ganization which will 'be potent. In
the first place they must provide for
the returning veteran, and the solu
tion of the employment problem will
be a huge factor ip. the future of the
soldier. They must assure the sol
dier that lessons of this war will be
reflected in future policies of the
United States to such ian extent that
the mistakes f this war will not be
repeated.

OUT YOU GO! SHOUTED
HERO, GIVING LIFE TO
SAVE HIS COMRADE
Tank Corporal Shoved Gun
ner to Safety When Only
One Could Escape
By A. E. Geldhof
WASHINGTON, April 10. "Greater
love hath no man than this; that he
lay down his life for his friend."
Here is one of the most beautiful
stories of the war. The classic senti
ment of Damon and Pythias is out
done by modern fact in a shell-hole
in France,
Harold W. Roberts of San Francisco
was a corporal in Company A, 344th
Battalion of the Tank Corps.
He was assigned to drive a "whip
pet" tank during the battle in Mon
trebeau woods. October 4. Just ahead
of Roberts tank another "whippet"
had become disabled and put out of
action. . . ,
The ground was difficult and full
of shell-holes, but Roberts thought he
could maneuver into position in a
clump of bushes where he could af
ford protection to the 'disabled tank.
Tank Submerged -
Suddenly his machine gave a great
lurch, and slid bead down into a shell
hole 10 feet deep. It was filled with
water, which had deceived the driver
to its depth.
Roberts' tank was completely sub
merged. Water began pouring in
through the gunports, and in a few
seconds the floor of the machine was
under two or three feet of water.
Quick as a flash the two men in the
tank realized that one of them was
facing death. If they opened the lit
tle door in the back of the tank one
of them could escape. But. the water
would rush in as they did so, and the
man who remained was doomed.
It was a situation to test men's
souls to the utmost. Which of those
two brave American soldiers was to
make the supreme sacrifice to lay
down his life for his friend? They
had only a second or two to decide.
"Out You Go"
The gunner stood stupefied. 1
"Well, only one of us can get out,"
said Driver Roberts. His voice was
calm and firm as he delivered his own
death sentence.
'Out you go!" he-continued. As he
spoke he opened the door of the tank
and pushed his comrade out.
They found his body in the tank
when they pulled it from the shell
hole after the battle.
Corporal Roberts', uncle, Paul W.
Leifert, of San Francisco, will receive
a congressional medal of honor as the
nation's token of gratitude for his
nephew's act.

Absence of Manufactured Art
icles Causes Peasants to
Keep Supplies
OMSK, Siberia, Feb. 11. (Corre
spondence of the Associated Press.)
Disinclination of the peasant and the
huntsman to part with the products of
his land or of his hunt because he
cannot buy needed manufactured arti
cles with the' money he would obtain
therefor, is one of the causes of the
commercial stagnation in Russia to
day. Clothing, boots, socks, tools,
"machinery, necessities for his house
hold he fain would acquire, but a
pile of rubles will not bring them to
his door. They do not exist In Si
beria. So the peasant keeps his wheat
and other cereals and the hunter
stores the furs and skins. Money has
lost Its value here.
Fluctuation of the Russian ruble,
and the difficulty and cost encounter
ed by the tradesman in getting his
goods to market has reduced com
merce to a minimum. The merchant
will .not run the risks involved with
out -expecting big profits and this has
caused manufactured commodities to
soar In price. . , ,
Another -important factor Is feeling.
Several merchants who have been do
ing business in Russia informed the
Associated Press correspondent that
the habit of tipping (bribing they
called 1 it) was increasing. Our for
eign merchant who sends goods to
Omsk, said:
"When I forward a carload of mer
chandise from Harbin or Vladivostok
I don't know, in the first place, wheth
er it will ever arrive with the railroad
conditions as they are. I must send
a. representative with the car to pay
out money on the way to officials and
employes. Otherwise my car will be
side-tracked. That is the great evil of
Russia today. Business has developed
into speculation."
Before the war Siberian wheat was
worth 10 cents per eight pounds; to
day it Is sold for .the normal equiva
lent of about $4. That shows how
prices have jumped. ' .
All authorities agreed that the ar
rival of manufactured articles in Si
beria and central Russia is an urgent
necessity. They have great expecta
tions of the American war trade board
In this respect and point out that
the well-organized Siberian co-operative
associations could easily attend to
the distribution.
The things Imperative for the sal
vation and reorganiaztion of Russia
are placed in this order: First; peace
and order; second, efficient operation
of the railroads under the direction of
John . F. Stevens,, the American ex
pert; third, the economic, rehabilita
tion? ofthe-eountry by - the concerted
help of the powers. These things at
tained, the impression generally pre
vails that .Russia would be one of
the first great nations to recover from
the war on account of her great and,
as yet, entirely undeveloped resources.

NEW YORK, April 10. The most
signiticant feature of today's very live
ly stock market, as indicating its ex
tremely speculative character, was the
free buying of United States Steel at
an extreme advance of 2V4 points and
the abrupt reversal of the last hour,
when realizing for profits abruptly ef
fected most gains and in some cases
resulted in losses. In some other re
spects the market displayed none of
its recent extravagant aspects, fur
ther substantial, but temporary ad
vances in motors and shippings pro
viding the chief diversion, or the early
and intermediate session.
Rails lapsed after occasional frac
tional advances .and oils, metals, ta
baccos and sugars were most often re
actionary, losing 1 to 3 points. Sales
amounted to 1,400,000 shares, the larg
est total thus far for this year.
Bonds, including Liberty issues and
internationals were irregular within
restricted limits. Total sales, par
value, aggregated $11,875,000. Old
United States bonds were unchanged
on call.
GRAIN MARKET
CHICAGO, April 10. Increased
competition from Argentina made the
corn market . today average much
lower. Prices closed unsettled at 2c
net decline to c advance with May
$1.56 to $1.66 and July $1.50 to
$1.51. Oats lost c to c and pro
visions 37c to 75c.
. .Word that cargoes of Argentine corn
were being bought at 13 cents under
July in New York for April-May ship
ment gave aggressiveness to the bear
side of the ' corn market, especially
after midday, when the news became
generally known. Nearby deliveries
of corn. here, however, showed relative
strength as a result of wet weather.
Oats weakened with corn, despite
wet weather delays to seeding.
Selling by -stockyard interests sent
provisions down grade.

Must Bore Through Chalk
Transcontinental Trai
LONDON, April 10 Plans for
a tunnel 32 miles long between
France and England to cost a bil
lion dollars or more are so far
perfected that construction can
start at once. It will take five
years to complete the tunnel.
British and French governments
are said to be in entire accord on
the project. No preference in
rates is to be given any country.
The approach to the tunnel will
be northwest of Dover, some
miles back from the coast, be
cause of the huge cliff between
Folkestone and Dover.
More than 21 miles of the 32
will be under the sea and the
tubes will go down to a depth of
280 feet.
Two tunnels, each 18 feet in
diameter, are to be sunk, with
cross galleries every 200 yards.'
Near the middle of the tunnel
there will be a dip for one mile
and a water lock by means of
which the tunnel can be flooded
and dis-Tbled for use in case of
emergency. This lock will be con
trolled from Dover.
Dig 1CO Feet Below Sea
The , deepest water along the
route of the tunnel i3 ISO feet and
it is proposed to go deep enough
to have a cover of the chalk sea
bottom 100 feet thick between the
top of tbe tunnel and the bottom
of the channel. Thi.i will protect
the tubes from the sea and also
from destruction by enemy activ
ities in time of war.
The tunnel will carry besides
the traiii tracks, telephone and
telegraph wires-1 and pneumatic
tubes for the dispatch cf letters

First Attempt Mada in 1874
First steps toward a channel
tunnel were taken in 1S74 when a
French company sank an experi
mental shaft in France. Then in
1SS1 a British company sank
a shaft and drove a boring
2000 yards toward the channel.
The work wa3 stopped by the gov
ernment, which decided that such
a project should be carried out by
the government. The project was
revived in 1913 and naval and
military advice asked, but the
outbreak of the war stopped prog
ress. With the tunnel in operation
tne channel could be crossed in
45 minutes and the time from
London to Paris will be but six
hours, while examination of bag
gage on the trajn would do away
with customs delays.
Express trains would be made
up in London for Constantinople,
Rome, and Brindisi, Bagdad ana
other cross-continent runs.

13 BILLION MARKS
IN GERMAN BUDGET
Deficit of Seven Billions Is
. Faced by Assembly, Says
Minister of Finance'
. WEIMaK Wednesday, April 9. (By
the Associated Press.) Germany's
financial condition was set forth by
Minister of Finance Schiffer in aa
dressing the national assembly on the
budget for 1919. Treasury bills on
January 31, said the minister, amount
ed to 53,300,000,000 marks and have
since risen to 63,700,000,000 marks.
The expenditure for the army ana
navy had fallen from 3,500,000,000
marks in January to 2,000,000,000
marks in March.
The budget, the minister stated, bal
anced at roughly 13,000,000,000 marks,
which meant an addition of 5,700,000,
000 marks as compared with last year,
and the deficit 'would sot be Was than
7,500,000.000 marks.
Herr Schiffer said the budget did
not represent all the consequences of
the war, such as indemnities payable
to the entente. He made an urgent
appeal for economy, but said the one
unavoidable item of additional expen
ditures was 1,600,000,000 marks, repre
senting increases ot salary tor of
ficials, this being rendered necessary
, by the increased cost of living.
