NEW YORK. July 8 Dr. Ed
ward A. I'.umlry, vice-president
and treasurer 6f the Mail and Ex
press company, publishers of the
New York Evening Mail, was ar
rested here tonight in the office
of Attorney General Lewis,
charged with perjury in a report
to A. Mitchell Palmer, alien prop
ertr custodian.
The warrant v.-as issued by a
federal commissioner upon the
complaint of Attorney General
Lewis, who had been conducting
an investigation for some time in
to the affairs of the Mail.
The attorney general charged that
Rumley purchased the stock of 'he
Mail and Express company m June.
1917. from Henry L. Stoddard, nd
that in doing so he acted 'on beh if of
the imperial German goverr.mor.i. The
attorney poneral charged that the Ger
man govc-rnment paid to RuTc.ley iu
several transactions connected "with
the purchase of the Mail. $1.3Gl,00e.
The payments, it was alleged, wer-.i
concealed until their details were dis
covered by investigators for the de
partment of justice and the New York
state attorney general.
The complaint against Dr. Ttiimley
charges that in making a repor: to
the alien property custodian regard
ing a transaction, he failed to disclose
his relation with Count Yon Bern
storff. German ambassador to the
United States and Dr. Henrieh F. Al
, bert. commercial attache of the Ger
man embassy.
In an announcement tonight of tK
arrest of Dr. Rumley, attorney Generr!
Lewis declared that the money "ra?
paid to Rumley from deposits of the
Cerman government standing in the
name of Dr. Albert, or of Albert and
Von Bernstorff. jointly, in this city.
The total so far traced, he added, is
11.361.000.
The transfers of monev, Mr. Lewis
said were concealed in this manner.
"Albert procured various banks
where the German government had ac
cess to issue cashier's checks to the
order of one Walter Lyon, a member
of the former Wall street firm of Rerjs
korf. Lyon & Co. This firm in turn
paid the monev over to Rumley or to
the S. S. McClure newspaper corpora
tion, which had been organized by
Rumley for the purpose of the trans
action. "In some cases. Albert Irevr "he

WASHINGTON, July 8. General
Pershing's communique for Sunday,
reporting the successful raid in the
Vosges in which losses in killed,
wounded and prisoners were inflictel
upon the enemy, says today passe i

Americans. The communique fol

"Section A In the Vosges we made
a successful raid, killing and wound
ing a number of the enemy and taking
several prisoners. The day passed
quietly at other points occupied by our
troops.
"Section B In the Chateau Thierry
region between July 4 and 5 the ri:'le
and machine gun duel on the right of
the line continued. Most of the Ger
man fire came as before, from hill "04
and the Bols De Buresches. Machine
guns were also in operation against
Bouresches. The enemy artillery fire
was distinctly lighter. A much small
er number of shells fell on the rig:it of
our advanced positions than during
the preceding- days although this part
of our lines remained the principal ob
jective. "It was also notable that most of the
shells were of small and medium cali
ber and that the proportion of ga
shells had diminished. On the other
hand, the German airplanes appeared
in greater numbers and larger forma
tions, a number of groups of from five
to eight planes being observed.
"In the enemy's rear areas the ab
normal troop movements which fol
lowed our attack on Vaux seemed to
have decreased. The enemy is busily
engaged creating machine gun em
placements and constructing other
works. There was evidence pointing
to the destruction of still another am
munition dump. Several paper bal-

Comments in
'I, however, Mr., Wilson de
sires his positions of prominence
to be continued and be perpetu

his demands mean only the op
pression of Germany and the ne
gation of those principles of in
ternational justice and freedom
which are continually in the
months of the entente rulers, es
pecially President Wilson."
The Vienna Reich Post says;
"President Wilson's latest for
mula is nothine more than a re
newed declaration of war noth
ing but an announcement of mail
ed fist neic'e. America's war
under Wilson's leadership is not
a war of defense in Washington's

ITALIAN ARMY HEADQUAR
TERS. Sunday July 7. (By the Associ
ated Press). The Italian commandant
under whose direction the American
fliers are working on the Italian front
has only one fault to find with them.
They never want to remain on the
ground. Regardless of the weather, the
fierceness of the barrage or the vigil
ant enemy chasers they want -to be in
the air after the enemy.
Lieut. Harry L. Holtz, of Burley,
Idaho, showed he could combine cool
ness in danger with a thorough under
standing of Italian habits and custom
On his way back over the Austrian
lines after a deep raid into enemy ter
ritory his plane was struck by a burst
of shrapnel from anti-aircraft guns.
One fragment lodged In the body of
Holtz' machine, another tore a hole,
in the right wing, while a third splin
tered one of the left wing 8pars,.ut
the same time cutting one of the con
trol cables to such an extent that a
single strand of steel wire was left.
Lieutenant Holtz pointed out the
break to the Italian mechanic accom
panying him to show the Imminent
danger they were in. Th8 mechanic
without a moment's hesitation, climb
ed out and fought his way to the wing
against a tremendous wind pressure.
Then lying flat on his face and brac
ing his feet against the strut, he
grasped the damaged cable with one
hand on each side of the break.
Just when he was getting a grip on
the last strand of the cable it parted
and the value of his daring action was
apparent. With the cable gone the big
airplane was useless, but he coolly
clung there, substituting his strength
for it and enabling Lieutenant Holtz
to bring the machine safely into Ital
ian territory.
After landing, the lieutenant showed
himself a true student of Italian cus
toms. Instead of trying to thank the
mechanic in faulty talian, he simply
rushed up to the assistant, threw his
arms around him and kissed him vig
orously on both cheeks. The cheering
from the nearby Italians and Amer
icans which greeted this act must have
made the Austrians across the Piave
wonder if another attack was impend

of the enemy on duty at the machine
gun position fled at his approach. .
In the Marne sector July 3 and t
were quiet. The enemy's artillery fira
was much less than ours.
"In Picardy from July 3 and 4 the
main event was the capture of prison
ers and a machine gun by a party of
our men. From the statements of pris
oners, it was learned the German3
were eold to be on the alert since the
Americans were likely to attempt
some operation on Indiendence day.
Our party started in three groups,
supported by a box barrage. The Ger
mans opened strong resistance but
were overpowered. Besides suffering
heavy losses In killed and wounded,
they left three prisoners in our handj.
"The German artillery showed only
average activity. There were concen
trations near Caniigny and Grivesnes
with attempts by the enemy to place
interdiction fire on our roads arouha
Villers-TOurnelle and Broyes.

In the same region a raid was attempt

proached our Mire and threw a large
number of grenades. None of the gren

chine gun and automatic rifle fire, and
particularly the flanking fire of one o!
our machine guns, forced the party to
withdraw. Our artillery co-operated
in forcing the withdrawal. Our own
patrols operated this night without in

GERMAN PLANS ILLUSIVE
WITH THE FRENCH ARMY IN
FRANCE. July 8 (By the Associated
Press). Wherever the battle front
has been closely viewed no signs of
an Imminent German movement were
discoverable. Quiet, Just as striking
as before the last two enemy offens
ives, reigns everywhere.
Almost a month has elapsed since
the cecesslon of the battle south, ol
Montdidier and no really seiroua op
eration has been fought since.
The correspondent talked with a
number of captives and gathered that
they regarded their divisions as units
for holding the 'positions while: the
shock divisions were taken to the
rear for reconstitution after the last
severe assaults.
The tone in which the prisoners
spoke indicated come resentment at
the German system of choosing the
best men from the various units to
form the shock divisions, thus reduc
ing the other units to a secondary
(lass, whose onerous work of hold
ing the line and maintaining the posi
tior while exceedingly costly,
brought no glory.
Prisoners from these divisions are
unable to give a. hint where the fresh
onslaught Is to be delivered as thev
had been cut off almost entirely from
communications in the rear.
The arrival of the Americans may
force the enemy, to hasten the renew
al of the offensive which, according
to his previous proceedure this year
should occur about five weeks after
the preceding assault. 1 '

"Dr. Rumley in his report to the

closure of his relations with Albert
or Von Bernstorff, or the imperial
German government. Instead, he re
ported that he owed $100,000 to Her

that Mrs. Bu.-'ch. referred to in bis
statement, was Mrs. Adolpli Busch.
widow of the St. Louis brewer, who
was questioned recently by govern

Germany.
Dr. Rumlcy's interests were varied,
for besides being engaged in the
newspaper business, he was sexietury
of the M. Rumley company of Lap'i-to,
lnd., which manufactured agricuiturai
implements and, as founder of the In

Moreover, after having attended the
university of Notre Dame, and the Uni

In a statement issued late tonight,

"The entire amount which went into

While the deal was made with Hen

10 evidence that Mr. Stoddard knew
it was German money.
Mr. Stoddard retired from the man
agement of the paper and still held
most of the outstanding bonds. When
the United States declared war against
Germany, Mr. Stoddard threatened to
'oreclose the bonds unless the Even
ing Mail expressed loyalty to this
ountry in every way.
.Mr. Stoddard said that he bad
known for two weeks the government
as searching the source of the funds,
ut . he was astounded to hear the

"Just before this country entered

Mr. Stoddard.

The investigation started by tho
representatives of the sheriff's offite

case has opened up some
rather peculiar circ f.nstances, and
which reflects on the mother of the

In response to one telegram sent
by the sheriff's office, a reply was re
ceived which disclosed the fact thflt
the girl's mother resides at ?ant

an advertisement in a California paper

mother separated several years asi,
according to the story of the girl.
When the girl arrived at Clobe she
was taken to the house of George

JAPANESE RED CROSS
RICH AND POWERFUL
The following enlighten jfig address
upon the subject of the spirit of th?
Japanese Red Cross, was delivered on
the evening of the Fourth of July by
Mrs. Tokeo Shikamura:
People of the Warren district, it
gives me great pleasure to have the
honor of speaking to you about the
Japanese Red Cross.
The Red Cross, the most wonderful
international organization in existence
today, has socities In all parts of the
world.
Prior to the recent great activities
or our Red Cross, the Japanese Red
Cross was one of the leading national
societies. It has the distinction of be
ing not only the richest with an en
dowment fund of fl3.000.000. but also
the largest with Us 2,000.000 members.
Nothing was left undone for the ad
vancement and maintenance of the
society. The mort powerful influence
exerted is the patronage of the em
peror and empress. The late empress
was one of the most earnest workers.
During the Russo-Japanese war she
set a splendid example. Her imperial
majesty presented our hospitals with
a quantity of bandages prepared with
her own hanus. She also bestowed
I
artificial limbs and eyes as thn cases
required, among both Russians and
Japanese impartially.
The lofty dignified Red Cross head
quarters at Tokyo with certain rooms
for various purposes, great rooms for
receptions for writings, apartments for
officials and one especially for the em
peror and empress and all ranks from
the lowest to the highest have faith
fully followed the patronage of her ma
jesty. In looking back over the IHs-
forty of the society one cannot but be
astonished at its marvelous develop
ments since its first inception forty
years ago. Practically every village
and town in the kingdom was a
branch.
But it is the work of the nurses that
excel. The women with their inborn
delicacy, tireless patience, tender in
telligence and high devotion to duty
seemed especially adapted and proceed
unusually efficient in this work. In
stances of bravery, courage and sacri
fice are too numerous to give.
' Graduates from Red Cross hospitals
have been recognized by an Imperial
audience making nurses of the field
forces a part of the regular army and
joining their appropriate rank, as rank
of private for stretcher bearers, etc.
The medical officers are of the high
est devotion and a matter of pride to
the profession supplementary to th?
Bed Cross in times of emergency.
There is also a volunteer nurse asso
ciation under the auspices of the
crown princess and others of the royal
family.
The efficiency and splendid work
displayed by the Japanese Red Cross
in the beneficient care of the wounded
in the late Chlno-Japanese and Russo
Japanesn wars gained unlounded ad
miration and praise from all nations.
The world of the Red Cross has al
ways been kept before the public
through exhibitions and a tableaux or
so. of nurses in action at all war tim
naval expositions. That an efficient
working -force has always been ready
for action is clearly- shown by the fact
that the Japanese Red Cross unit was
ainonff the first on the western front.
Recently they united an audience with
the king and queen of England. Be
ing too far from the actual scenes of
conflict to render army service. Japan
has answered to the mute call of
human suffering with deepest sym
patic With the thought of the war's
terrible results war torn home1;,
widowed mothers and wives and sad
eyed children and wounded soldiers,
patriots and philanthropists gathered
to devise ways and means of extend
ing practical aid,. An organization with
Prince Tokugae as president and
with Baron Shibusawa and Honorable
Shimado as vice president, a sympathy
fund was soon started. Genuine heart
felt sympathy and approval quick'v
riowed from all parts of the kingdom
through numerous subscriptions. H3r
Imperial majesty, the empress, started
the list with $ 100,000 a year. The fund
total was $1,040,000 and wps distribut
ed among the allies, Great Britain.
France, Russia, Italy, Belgium, Serbia
and Roumania as the urgency of need
was evident early in July, l'.tl".
Thus It is across the broad Pacific
and through:
"East is east, and west is west, and
never the twain shall meet."
To the call of that universal sign of
the great Ked Cross on its field 'of
white in the cause of humanity, theie
I? no color, no race, no creed. Re
pponses quick and generous spring

Plain Facts' About the Meat Business
The Federal Trade Commission in it3 recent report on war
profits, stated that the five large meat packers have been
profiteering and that they have a monopoly of the market.
These conclusions, if fair and just, are matters of serious con
cern not only to those engaged in the meat packing business
but to every other citizen of our country.
The figures given on profits are misleading and the statement
that the packers have a monopoly is unsupported by the facts.
The packers mentioned in the report stand ready to prove
their profits reasonable and necessary.
.
The meat business is one of the largest American industries.
Any citizen who would familiarize himself with its details
must be prepared for large hotels.
i
The report states that the aggregate profits of four large pack
ers were $140,000,000 for the three war years.
This sum is compared with $ 1 9,000,000 a3 the average annual
profit for the three years before the war, making it appear
that the war profit was $121,000,000 greater than the pre
war profit.
This compares a three-year profit with a one-year profit a
manifestly unfair method of comparison. It is not only mis
leading, but the Federal Trade Commission apparently has
made a mistake in the figures themselves.
The aggregate three-year profit of $140,000,000 was earned
on sales of over four and a half billion dollars. It means about
three cents on each dollar of sales or a mere fraction of a
cent per pound of product.
Packers' profits are a negligible factor in prices of live stock
and meats. No other large business is conducted upon such
small margins of profit.
Furthermore and this is very important only a small por
tion of this profit ha3 been paid in dividends. The balance
has been put back into the businesses. It had to be, as you
realize when you consider the problems the packers have had
to solve and solve quickly during these war years.
To conduct this business in war times, with higher costs and
the necessity of paying two or three times the former prices
for live stock, has required the use of two or three times the
ordinary amount of working capital. The additional profit
makes only a fair return on this, and as has been stated, the
larger portion of the profits earned has been used to finance
huge stocks of goods and to provide additions and improve
ments made necessary by the enormous demands of our army
and navy and the Allies.
t
3 3fr 3 5
If you are a business man you will appreciate the significance
of these facts. If you are unacquainted with business, talk
this matter over with some business acquaintance with your
Linker, say and ask him to compare profits of the packing
industry with those of any other large industry at the present
.'ime.
No evidence is offered by the Federal Trade Commisjion in
support of the statement that the large packers have a mon
opoly. The Commission's own report show3 the large num
ber and importance of other packers.
The packers mentioned in the statement stand ready to prove
to any fair minded person that they are in keen competition
with each other, and that they have no power to manipulate
prices.
If this were not true they would not dare to make this positive
statement. ,
Furthermore, government figures show that five large packers
mentioned in the report account for only about one-third of
the meat business of the country.
They wish it were possible to interest you in the details of
their business. Of how, for instance, they can sell dressed
beef for less than the cost of the live animal, owing to utiliza
tion of by-products, and of the wonderful story of the methods
of distribution throughout this broad land, as well as in other
countries. ;
The five packers mentioned feel justified in co-operating with
each other to the extent of together presenting this public
statement.
They have been able to do a big job for your government
in its time of need; they have met all war time demands
promptly and completely and they are willing to trust th?ir
case to the fairmindedness of the American people with the
facts before them.

Strategy
It now seems to be pretty well agreed
that the allies on the western front were
outgeneralled as well, as out-numbered in
the first two big offensives of their German
foes. We had just as well acknowledge
the corn. Ludendoerf, the -brains of the
German staff, had evolved four great prin
ciples of strategy which he applied with
great success in the early months of this
year. They broke entirely away from ac
cepted methods of this war and were posi
tively daring in their originality, and cer
tainly successful in their demonstration.
The first of these discarded entirely the old
idea of merely advancing to the second or
third lines. Ludendoerf insisted that his
men advance until they had gone through
the ARTILLERY LINES. A five mile ad
vance was the least that could be made with
any assurance of success, he argued.
Again, light artillery must be kept abreast
of the advance of he infantry, and the Ger
mans solved thi3 with a short mortar gun
of most simple construction and large cali
bre. More important still, and a principle
in which the allies have been weak and
erring ever since the war began, was the
rapid advance of supports to aid the storm
ing troops hold and widen their captured
positions. In fact, the Germans had made
mechanical as well as mental progress dur
ing the past winter when Hindenburg of the
fierce moustache and the wooden head had
been supplanted by the keen, alert, satur
nine, cruel, relentless Ludendoerf, and
these things, together with their concentra
tion of numbers in certain sectors and their
vast reinforcements from the east, made
possible their long advances in the first
three great offensives. But the fourth and
fifth offensives, upon Rheim3 and Com
peigne, were quickly stopped and finally
shattered without material gains. Why?
Because the allied command had solved the
system and organized to meet it. Foch is
some strategist himself, having no rival m
Europe, unless it be this same Ludendoerf,
and hence the tactics that won so much
ground before Cambrai and Armenticres
and the Chemin des Dames failed utterly
before Rheims and Compeigne. But the
greatest offensive of all is now long past
due. Not until it has been launched and
checked will it be possible to estimate the
crest of the German tide and predict with
any certainty the trend of this year's cam
paign and the turning of this tide back
towards the east.
THE VEST A NONESSENTIAL?
(From the rieieltmd ri;iin Dealer)
Along with other non-essentials the mas
culine vest is threatened by the apostles of
conservation. The military simplicity of
the two-piece suit is crowding the vest to
the sartorial wall. The man who loves com
fort doffs his vest when the mercury goes
up. and dons it reluctantly when the mer
cury goes down. Now with the cost of
clothes going up and the materials growing
scarcer, the utility of the vest from the dress
reform point of view becomes questionable.
This is not the first time the vest has
been attacked. Its enemies have called it
a survival of the antique and a relic of the
age of the superfluous. The fact that it is
a" descendant of the cuirass of chivalry
doesn't-prctect it. The vest, or waistcoat,
may have glorified a Brurr.rrel or domin
ated a Weller. or added a specialized dig
nity to the clergy, buf this makes no appeal
to the conserving iconoclast.
In ilsolf it will b admitted that the vest
is not a thing of beauty. When it, doesn't
sue it usuily bulges, nnd rarely knows a
roldon mean. Its good points are largr-lv
emyha.izrd by being hidden. It dors well
enough for carrying loose change, and it
serves on occasions as o background for a
neatly trped watch chain.
At the same time it will be hard for the
masculine nature to give uo a friend with
whom it rvrs held such intimate relation?.
But there can be no hard and fast rule about
it. No department head is expected to
make the fate of the vest the subject of a
general order. The man who craves the
modern waistcoat will continue to wear it
military simplicity and non-essentials to the
contrary notwithstanding.
PLEASANT LITTLE PEACE TERMS
Great Britain must turn over its war
fleet to Germany, return Gibraltar to Spain
and restore Egypt and the Suez canal to
Turkey. Great Britain, France and the
United States must pay Germany an indem
nity of at least $45,000,000,000. Belgium
and French occupied territory must be sur-
rendered to Germany.
These are the conditions contained in the
German peace program published in the
Nachrichten of Goerlitz, Prussia, by Count
Roon, a member of ' the Prussian house of
lords, according to a Havas News agency
dispatch from Basel, Switzerland.
Count Roon says Germany is entitled to
the following terms because of its strength
and until they are realized there shall be no
armistice and no cessation of submarine
warfare :
Annexation of Belgium with administrative
autcnomy In the interior.
Independence of Flanders.
Anncxatirn of the entire Flanders coa.st, in
cluding Calais-.
Ann ?cation cf the Bricy and Longwy basins
and the Toul, Belfort and Verdun regions east
ward. Restitution to Germany of all her colonies,
including Kalo Chew.
Great Britain to cede to Germany such naval
base3 and ccaling stations as Germany desig
nates. Greet Britain must return Gibraltir to
Spain, cede its war fleet to Germany, rebtcre
Egvpt to Turkey and the Suez canal to
Turkey.
Greece must be ret stablishe i under .lammr
King Constantiue with frontiers as beiore fie
war.
Austria and Bulgaria will d'vide Servia and
Montenegro.
Great Britain. Franre and the United States
must pay all of Germiny's war costs, the in
demnity being a minimum of $45,000,000,000.
They also must agree to deliver war mate
rials immediately.
France and Belgium are to remain occupied
at their expense until the tendi'ions are car
ried cut.
And only a crushing blow on the battle
field can drive these peace terms from the
German mind!
A New York paper, in a long editorial
upon the late United States Senator Ben
Tillman of South Carolina, contains a
worthy epitaph for he of the pitchfork
sobriquet when it concludes: "He was
able and honest; peace at last to this fine
old fighter." When Tillman first came into
political power he was scorned by the
patricians and loved by the plebians of his
state. His wild bull of Basham tactics won
him his place in the public eye, but these
did not keep him there. They can never
keep a small, weak man in a high place for
long. He must have force and ability to
stay there. Hi3 long career in the senate
smoothed the rough places of the disposi
tion and tamed the firery spirit. His inher
ent sense of fairness came to the surface
in the process of the development of his
strong mind, and in the end, he won the
respect of his old enemies of South Caro
lina, and so he died with the honors of a
statesman and not the mere notoriety of a
politician. He entered office as a menace,
but his wit and good sense and inherent in
telligence gradually led him to paths where
he was of real service to his state and nation.
Russia goes steadily from bad to worse.
She has not onyl ceased to be of any aid
o her former allies, but is now a positive
menace. If she were a neutral nation it
would not be so bad, but she is merely a
German vassal or dependency. The Prus
sian has seized her richest provinces, her
seaports, her ships, her oil wells, her fields,
her factories, her forts and her munitions
of war. Worst of all, he has taken over
her platinum deposits in the Oral moun
tains. This is the hardest blow of all. Plat
inum is a necessity of war. It plays a vital
part in the making of high explosive. Wei,
it now seems that over 90 per cent of the
world's platinum product comes from Rus
sia. Lenine has been of more help to the
kaiser than ever Hundenvurg has been.
Why the allies should hesitate for a mo
ment to intervene in Russia is past under
standing. China has a million and Japan
a half million soldiers available for Siberia.
They would be able to worry Germany
more than a little as she licks the Russian
platter. Every day of delay srrms to brinr;
fresh news of German seizures and Bclshc
viki treacheriei and the further sinking of
Russia into a stale of famine, violence ard
despair.
1 Itint declined to sin the Arizona "Vng"
bill, but it becomes a law, nevertheless,
automaticc.lly, and in time. too. to keep

ORGANIZING LABOR
ASSETS OF STATE
COMMENCED
District Organizers Have Been
Appointed and Approval Is
Waited From Washington;
State Divided Into Districts
Work of organizing the labor re
sources of the state is now going for
ward under the supervision ol Thomas
J. Croaft, state labor' commissioner.
Three district organizers have been
appointed whose names will be made
public as soon as they are confirmed
at Washington. These men will orgar.
icz the whole state, working in unison
wtili the director in each county.
The county directors will be chair
man of a volunteer advisory commit
tee, known as the labor district com
mittee, on which capital and labor will
have equal representation. It will be
the duty cf this committee to see that
an equal distribution of labor is main
tained in its county, preference bein
shown to essential Industries.
The needs of the farmers will be
supplied by means of the volunteer
agents appointed in each branch of the
county tarm bureau. These men will
be volunteers and are called the farm
labor reserve agents of the depart
ment of labor. They will co-operate
with the farmers in the distribution of
ranch labor.
Frank H. Parker, chairman of the
Maricopa county farm bureau, has
been appointed coiunteer agent of the
United States public service reserves
in the farm labor. He will have
charge of the organization of the vol
unteer agents of the farm bureau.
it will be the duty of the depart
ment of agriculture to determine the
needs of the farmers and of the depart
ment of labor to fill them. In this
co-operation the greatest efficiency
can be reached by both departments.
The war industries board is working
out a survey of the state, dividing the
industries in the order of their essen
tiality, for the use of the department
of labor in distributing employment.
The great industries of the siate, mm
ing, agriculture and railroads, are
classed as very essential to the con
duct of the war.
A survey is also being made to
show the number of workers in each
class of industry and the percentage
engaged in war work.

CONNOLLY EASILY
WINS FROM DIXIE
Pat Connolly of Butte. Mont., heavy
weight wrestler, won his return match
with Earnest Dixie, the local Russian
mat artist, ut the Star theater. S
easy was Iiis victory, in fact, that
more than a suspicion was rqised in
the minds of tans that in his first
match with Idxie he "threw eft" in
tentionally and not "show goods. Not
that there was anything crooked, bu'
simply the desire of au athlete to get
a return match and more money out
o! the public before moving on. In
the first match he failed to throw
Dixie after agreeing to put him down
in an hour.
Connolly showed unsuspected class,
as may be Gathered from the tact that.
Pixie, locally considered a "hard cus
tomer" was downed the first time in
3'A minutes. The second fall did not
come so easily for Connolly wlu
worked for 45 minutes before placing
the Russian's shoulders on the mat.
The match was refereed by J. V.
Morley, until recently physical direc
tor of the Y. M. C. A. but now act
ing as general secretary or that insti
tution. .Mr. Morley's method .of act
ing as third man ou the mat made it
evident that he was well versed in
the wrestling game.
Dixie made a good showing ncninst
his older, heavier and cleverer anta-

and upon German cities and
thousands of copies of an appeal writ
ten by a Bavarian urging his compat
riots to protest against Prussian tyr
anny and autocracy.
The document was found recently on
a Bavarian prisoner of war captured
by the French. In it the writer places
upon Emperor William the guilt of the
war and expresses other sentiments
against Prussia militarism well known
to exist in Bavaria, despite frequent
official testimonials of alleged solidar
ity and unity between both two Ger
man states.
As its circulation in Cermany is, of
course, prohbited, the French authori
ties undertook its distribution by air
route. Some copies accidently have
fallen on the French lines. The docu
ment reads:
"BAVARIANS, COMPATRIOTS"

of the war has spread also to Bavaria,
and which i3 leading our Bavarian peo
ple to almost certain ruin, imposes up
on us the sacred duty of thinking of

in opposition to the Interests of the

the contrary France, for example, has

Among the governments that are our
opponents in this war, not one has as
one of its war aims the extinction of
our country. But the war hinges en
tirely, and with good right, against
Prussia which, with the Russia of oth
er days, is the most corrupt state in
Europe. The sons of Bavaria sacrifice
their lives by hundreds of thousands
for this Prussia, for this country which
a few decades ago, in 1866 took away
a part of our territory and an enor

WORKS OUT ALL
DRILL DETAILS
Final details in the awarding of the
contract for the diamond drilling of
the Calumet & Jerome have been sat
isfactorily worked out and the con
tract will be let to the same corpora
tion which made a great success at the
property' of the New Cornelia and oth- j
er mines in the State of Arizona. The ;
plans made by the management of the j
Calumet & Jerome call for three drill !
holes to 'be sunk a minimum depth of
500 feet in the ground lying east of the i
fault, or in that ground which has been j
chosen as the most promising in a re-1
cent examination made by the engin- J
eer who was prominent in the location .
of the drill holes for much of the New j
Cornelia work. The first drill will be ;
sunk from the winze on the 600-foot j
level of the present workings and will 1
run toward the Gadsden property ad-
joining. I
Recent showing of chalcopyrite in ,
the Gadsden property, similar to the
formation found in the Calumet & Je-1
rome ground is attracting much atten-1
tion In Jerome and it seems to be the j
concensus of opinion around the camp j
that this formation presages the loca- j
tion of the high-grade body at depth.
The Gadsden workings are now at the
1000-foot level and the diamond dri'.l ;
of the Calumet & Jerome workings j
down from the 600-foot level will en-1
counter the formation at a furtherj
depth of four hundred feet. i
The other two holes will be drawn
toward the property of the United
Verde Extension working upon the
theory that the extension of the Unit-:
ed Verde Extension ore body will be ;
found in the Calumet ground.
It is not expected that the costs of
1 drilling as outlined will exceed $20,000,
as Uie Laiumei s jrrane m nmiu:iit, ,
the contract assumes no responsibility
for rising labor costs. I
The workings on the No. 1 crosscut j
following the water course recently en
countered have uncovered considera-,
ble chalcopyrite, and in the opinion or j
Aauber, the mine superintendent, thi3
formation should lead to the discovery ',
of the ore underlying the outcrop on
the surface of the claim. '
BRITISH LEARN
TO FIGHT GOTHAS
ON DHT RAIDS
LONDON (Correspondence of The
Associated Press) The activity of
British airmen in connection with re
cent air raids on London indicates that
thfy are learning1 rapidly the art of
fishing the Cciha in the dark. I'niil
a fe-.- niotnhs rgo there was little air

raiding craft enjoyed a marked advan

to avrld attack while dropping their

It is evident that they are able no

IFrom the Globe Record.)
Agitators of the type of some of the
Hunt camp-followers who are seeking
to create industrial unrest that woula
hamper America in the war should
look upon the record that has been
made by the printers and profit there
by. This letter, received yesterday by
the Arizona Record from Marsdon G.
Scott, president of the International
Typographical union, tells the story:
On June 15, 1018. 40S1 journeymen
members of this union and 6:G appren
tices were in the army and navy forces
of the United States ami Canada.
Seventy-five of our members have
fallen in battle in France or have died
in military camps in America.
To the widows, orphans, fathers,
mothers or other relatives of these
men this international union has paid
mortuary benefits amounting to $22,
3S0. During the past twelve months this
international union has paid $.'!54,0"0
to 1500 old age pensioners.
In the same period this union has
paid mortuary benefits amounting to
$312,400.
The total expense for the mainten
ance and for improvements at the Un
ion Printers' Home at Colorado
Springs last year was $167,600.
This union has invested $30,000 in
cash of the three Liberty loans, $90,000
in all. Our subordinate organizations
and individual members have invested
more than $3,000,000 in these securi
ties. Our strike expenses for the part
twelve months were but $1237.
The gross earnings of our members
amounted to more than $71,iito.oM tor
the year for 62.000 members, and the
insignificant amount expended for
strike purposes reflects our determina
tion to give full patriotic support to
the governments under which we livo
in the terrific responsibilities wuicn
now confront us all.
The officers of this international un
ion are volunteers in the army fcr the
preservation of industrial peace, for
the duration of the war at least, and
we will do our level best to give full
effect to the earnest recommendations
made by President Wilson in his proc
lamation creating the national war
labor board. There should be no
strikes or lockouts during the war.
This international union solicits nor
accepts contributions to its benefit
funds. Every dollar expended for
these purposes is paid by members of
this organization in the form of regu
lar dues and assessments.
This is in line with what all good
union men want to see done. The men
who have the real welfare of organized
labor at heart are not agitating for
strikes at this time. They want fair
play and they should have it. But.
first of all. they want the allies to win
this war and they are doing every
thing they can do to make victory
possible.

Meat Must
Be
Sold
Fresh meat is perishable. It
must be sold within about two
weeks for whatever it will bring.
A certain amount of beef is
frozen for foreign shipment, but
domestic markets demand fresh,
chilled, unfrozen beef
Swift & Company cannot in
crease prices by withholding meat,,
because it will not keep fresh .and
salable for more than a few days
after it reaches the market
Swift & Company cannot tell
at the time of purchasing cattle,
what price fresh meat will bring
when put on sale. If between
purchase and sale, market condi
tions change, the price of meat
must also change.
The Food Administration limits our
profit to 9 per cent on capital invested
in the meat departments. This is about
2 cents per dollar of sales. No profit
is guaranteed, and the risk of loss is not .
eliminated.
As a matter of fact, meat is often sold
at a loss because of the need of selling it
before it spoils.

didates anxious to serve the dear peo
ple, many of whom have already an
nounced their candidacy before the
primaries to be he'd in September.
Allan B. Jaynes of Tucson, chair
man of the state republican commit
tee :nd national committeeman from
Arizona, was one of the first anions
the early arrivals to put in appearance
nd was joined shortly afterwards by
Andrew Haumert secretary of the
state central committee. Both gentle
men were as busy as Kansas harvest
hands all morning welcoming the new
arrivals.
These included ex-Gov. Tom Camp
bell, who is reported as having already
shied his hat in the ring for another
try for the governorship. J. R. Treat,
chairman of the Pinal county republi
can committee. Flo-ence; George
Shea, Kingman; P. J. Sullivan, Yuma;
Col. F. S. Breen, editor Coconino Sun
and farmer and former provost mar
shal. Flagstaff; L. L. Henry, Globe;
H. N. Zipf, Tucson; J. 11. Udall, St.
Johns; J. H- I-arson, Thatcher; II. A.
Morgan, Willcox; J. -E. Crosby, Hol
brook; G. O. Notan, Ray; S. N. Noon,
Nogi'.es; A. H. Powers. Prescott; R.
A. Zlesmer and E. J. Flannigar, Bis
bee; T. J. Leeson, McNeil; and Fred
Meyers and David Benshimol of Doug
las, members or the Cochise county
central committee.
The county committee met during
the afternon and selected T. J. Leeson
of McNeal as chairman and William
Hicks or Douglas as secretary. They
will take the place or George Ludwig
and Ralph Zeismer. both of this city,
who served for the past to years.
Ludwig is on his way to France to
work for the Red Cross and Zeismer
has resigned.
At the meeting of the state commit
tee held in the evening, there was
considerable difficulty had in secur
ing some one to take the place of
Lieut, Tom Maddox, now on his way to
France.
They wanted to hand the package
to-some one from Cochise county, but
no one was rnxlous for the job but
Albert M. ames of Douglas was finally
given tie hopeless task as chairman
and Andrew Haumert of Phoenix was
again chosen as secretary. They will
serve until after the primaries, when
the new party council Is organized.
One of the most notable facts of the
meeting was the absence of such re
publican war horses as M. E. Cassidy
or Bisbee and A. H. Gardner of Tomb
stone, who were never known to be
on the absent list.
We wonder why? What Is the
reason?
JIMMY HENDERSON
IS LOCAL VISITOR
Jimmy Henderson, well known In
the district as a Y. M. C. A. worker,
stopped off here yesterday on his way
from cantonments further east 'to the
Pacific coast. He is making talks
under the auspices of the Y, in which
he tells the boys of liis experience
over there, when he served with the
Canadian Highlanders in the British
army in France.
His many friends were glad to see
him again and trust he will return to
the district when his war work is
ended.

Addresses of Cochise Soldiers
Ultras the relatives of the hoys

will have a chance to vote at the com
ing primary and general elections, as
provided by the Soldier Voting Bill,
passed by the recent legislature. This
is necessary owing to a telegram re
ceived from the adjutant at Washing
ton, I. C, by Recorder Ray II. Krebs
yesterday in answer to a q-iery for
addresses, in which the adj'.ant
stated it will be impossible to fur
nish the information due to frequent
chpnges and inadequate clerical force.
This leaves jhe local board here
without meins to ascertain 'he ad
dresses of the boys in camp so that
a baliot can be sent them as pre
scribed by the new law, unless the
relatives furnish the information to
the local board in Tombstone.
So far only ten addresses have been
turned in. If the information it not
secured by August 1, when the law
says the ballots should be sent out.
there will be very few soldi-T votes
registered in this county.
Clerk A. ('. Karter of the board of
supervisors is busy preparing the bal
lots, instructions, etc., for mailing to

BUSINESS RUSHING IN
JUSTICE COURT
, YESTERDAY
Judge High Has Busy Day;
Numerous Complaints Are
Filed and Arrests Made on
Various Charges
The Bisbee justice court yesterday
was one of the liveliest that it has
been Tor a number or days and per
haps, months. There were four de
fendants up before his honor.
The first man to be brought into
court was E. M. W'hitaker. proprietor
of the Quality Tailors on Main straat,
was arrested on a warrant charging
him with conducting a lottery In con
ducting a lottery in connection with
his suit club drawing on every Sat
urday night. The arrest grew out of
the fact that on last Saturday night
seven of his customers went into the
shop and asked if the drawing had
taken place and they were informed
that it had. They asked who drew the
suit and were told. They then asked
to see the box containing the numbers
to see if their numbes were In the
box. They were refused this request
and one of the number took the box
and an examination was made and It
was discovered that none of the num-
Ka litklrt K,. tho ninn whn were in
the shop were in the box. They had
paid in from $11 to $27. When they
discovered that their numbers were
not in the box they made a demand
for the return of the money that was
ppid in and it was refused them. Oth
ers heard of the affair yesterday and
made demands, but the money was
refused and one of the number then
filed a complaint against him. The
complaint was drawn by County At
torney Ross. The defendant was
brought into court and entered a plea
of not guilty and his case was set for
trial on July 11 nt 2 o'clock. He was
released on a $300 bond.
The next man on the list was Fran
cisco Itobles. a citizen of Mexico who
was charged with burglary. He waived
his preliminary examination and was
c-dered held to await the action of
the superior court. It was through the
work of Nieht Chief of Police Hill
Ruff, that Robles came to grief. Ruff
was standing on the plaza Saturday
night about midnight when he saw a
Mexican come down Howell avenue
and go across toward the depot. He
linH . lorpo hiinitlo under hia arm and
this looked suspicious to the officer
and he stopped the Mexican and "ound
that he had all sorts of articles n
his possession, watcnes. dress goous,
gold chains ect. He was taken and
locked up, and tljis morning it was
also discovered that he had broken
into the houses of Mrs. I. C. E. Adams
and Mrs. Etta Medigovich on School
hill and stolen the goods. When asked
in court why He entered the houses
he stated that his wife in Cananea
told him that if he did not get out
and get her some money and clothes
she would leave him. He came direct
to Misbee and got busy. He will now
have a chance to spend a while at
Florence and will no doubt lose his
"Dulie." as she will get neither money
or clothes.
Robert Walker, was arrested by
Constable Bert Tolley on a charge of
assaulting the Mexican newspaper
pedd'er. He beat him up with a cow
be'l that he carried and which he had
taken out of the sack In which he
carried it in order to try and defend
himself from the blows of Walker.
