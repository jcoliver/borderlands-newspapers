WASHINGTON, Oct. 28. Peace ne
gotiations and President Wilson's
statement asking his fellow country-:
men to return a democratic congress ;
in the November elections were the
vehicles of & partisan debate in the
senate today which continued through-,

The discussion which wag opened

criticised the president for carrying
on peace discussions with the central

Senator Knox said that the presi

PRESIDENT
TELLS WHAT
HE INTENDS
Wilson in Personal Letter to
Senator Simmons, Declares
Trade Discrimination Is the
Easiest' Way to Bitterness
(By Review Lessen Wire)
WASHINGTON. Oct. 28. President
Wilson replied today to republican
contentions that the third of his 14
peace terms is a free trade plank, by
explaining that in demanding the re
moval of economic barriers he meant
to suggest no restriction upon interna
policies but only that whatever tariff
high or low, any nation might deem
necessary it should apply equally to
all foreign nations.
The president's letter addressed to
Senator Simmons follows:
"Dear Senator: I am glad to re
spond to the question addressed" to
me by your letter of October 26. The
words I used in my address to the
congress of January 8, 1918, were,
The removal, so far as possible, of all
economic barriers and the establish
ment of an equality of trade condi
tions among all the nations consenting
to the peace and associating them-!
selves for its maintenance.-
"I, of course, meant to suggest no
restrictions upon the free determina
tion by any nation of its own economic
policy, but only that, whatever tariff
any nation might deem necessary for
jts own economic service, be that tar
iff high or low. it should apply equally
to all foreign nations; in other words I
that there should be no discrimina-l
tions against some nations that did
not apply to others.
"This leaves every nation free to de
termine for itself its own internal poli-;
cies and limits oniy us ngni io com-
Dound these policies of hostile dis
criminations between one nation and
another. Weapons of economic of dis
cipline and punishment should be left
to the joint action of all nations for
the purpose of punishing those who
will not submit to a general program
of Justice and equality.
"The experiences of the past among
nations have taught us that the at
tempt by one nation to punish another
by exclusive and discriminatory trade
agreement has been a prolific breeder
of that kind of antagonism which
often times results in war, and that
if a permanent peace is to be estab
lished among nations every obstacle
that hag .tood in the way of interna-
onal friendship should be cast aside,
It wag witn tnat fundamental purpose
in mlnd tnat i announced this princi-
Die in my address of January 8. To
prevent this great principle for parti
san purposes, and to inject the bogey
j of free trade, which is not involved
1 at all, is to attempt to divert the mind
of the nation from the broad and hu
mane principle of a durable peace by
introducing an internal question of
quite another kind. American business
has in the past been unaffected by a
policy of the kind suggested and it has
nothing to fear now from a policy of
simDle international Justice. It is in-
deed, lamentable that the momentous
issues of this solemn hour should be
! seized upon in an effort to bend them
J to partisan service. To the initiated
I and discerning, the motive is trans
parent and the attempt fails.
"Sincerely yours,
"WOODROW WILSON."
Following is the letter of Senator
Simmons:
"Dear Mr. President: Certain repub
lican leaders are attempting to make
a partisan use of paragraph three of
your peace terms found in your ad
dress to congress January 8. 1918. No
one hag authority to reply to a miscon
struction of any part of your address

of the finance committee of the sen-!
ate wish you would make reply to !

Vilhelm
AMSTERDAM. Oct. 28. tHy the
Associted Preass.) Exciting seen?3
occurred in the German reichstag
during the proceedings of the house
on Friday and Saturday. Outspoken
speeches wera indulged in.
In the course of the discussion the
Polish deputy, Korfantz, hotly at
tacked the Polish policy of the gov
ernment. He declared that ia Chem
nitz alone the war raw materials de
partment sold 8.000,000 narks worth
of carpets and other goods taken from
Poland. Seven hundred thousand poor
Polish people were carried off to
Germany, where they led the life of
slaves while Hrig. Gen. Pilsndskl (of
the Polish legion), whom the Polish
nation fegarded highly, was still held
in ths fortress at Magdeburg, despite
all appeals. The deputy concluded:
"We are not blaming the German
people for these persecutions, but Ger
man militarism. We extend the hand
of reconciliation to the German
people for the commonwealth."
The independent socialist. Dr. Cohu,
who declared that the war was lost
after the first battle of the Marne.
said that Gen. Ludendorff, at the end
of September, proposed the formation
of a government empowered to nego
tiate an armistice with President Wil
son, as it was impossible to guarantee
the maintenance of the war much
longer.
"The question cannot longer be
evaded," said Dr. Conn, "war with the
Hohenzollernt r peace without the
Hohenzollerns. World revolution will
follow on world imperialism and world
militarism, and we will overcome
them. We extend our hand to our
friends beyond the frontier in this
struggle."
The speech was received with such
commotion as cries of "shame." and
applause, that the vice-president
threatened to have the chamber
cleared.
Another socialist. Otto Ruehl, was
called to order for declaring that the
emperor must abdicate. He retorted:
"A call to order won't save him from
the criminal court." a
The house debated the bill amend
ing the constitution which was passed
Saturday. Several speakers displayed
anxiety to show that the reforms were
not dictated by the enemy, but had
been advocated since the spring of
1917.
The conservative. Herr Von Graefe,
complained that the proposed reforms
would destroy all the crown Influence
and declared that the conservative
party would refuse to co-operate in
such a break with the past.
State Secretary Groeber and War
Minister Major General Schuech both
declared that there was nothing in
the reforms which could endanger the
firm structure or the army or the per
sonal relationship between the Prus
sian king and the officers.

Former President Takes Issue
With Wilson on His Return
to Partisian Politics and
Urges Republican Majority
(By Review Leased Wire)
NEW YORK, Oct. 2S Col. Theo
dore Roosevelt, answering President
Wilson's appeal for return of a demo
cratic majority in congress, urged
voters of the nation, in an address
here tonight, to transfer control to
republican leadership. Such an out
come of the election, he declared,
would assure "our allies that America
is determined to speed up the war
and insist on unconditional surrender"
of the enemy, and would serve notice
on Germany "and her" vassal states"
that they would have to deal hence
forth "with the resolute and straight- i
forward soul of the American peo- j
pie and not merely with the dbscure
purposes and wavering will of Mr.
Wilson." I
Declaring that "half the leaders of! 5
the president's own party opposed him !)
ii ii i. r; uau uuuiuiiiru uiupcii m i :
war measures" Mr. Roosevelt asserted ,
that heads of the republican organiza-
tion in congress supported the admin
istration when a declaration or war
was needed, when there was a demand
Tor a draft, when the army was sent
overseas and when money was re
quired by taxation or by loans.
The former president spoke at a
meeting under the auspices of the re
publican club at Carnegie hall to ad
vocate "the election of the republican
state ticket hero in New York anc of
!he republican congressional ticke
throughout the union."
Rebuking what he termed the "ser
vility" of democratic leadership, the
colonel said it was small wonder that
in the cloak rooms of the house the
bitter jest circulates: 'Here's to our
czar, last in war, tirst to-ward peace,
long may lie waver." "
Mr. Roosevelt criticised the general
course of the administration through
out the war, declaring:
"If Mr. Wilson had really meant
to disregard politics, he would at once
constructed a coalition, non-partisian
cabinet, calling the best men of the
nation to the highest and most im
portant offices under him, without re
gard to politics. He did nothing of the
kind. In the positions most vital to
the conduct of the war. and in the po
sitions now most important in con
nection with negotiating peace, he re
tains or appoints men without the
slightest fitness for the performance
nf Ihe tasks, whose Bnle reco Timen-!
dation was a supple eagerness to serv
Mr. WiUon personally and to serve
Mr. Wilson's party insofar as such
service benefitted Mr. Wilson."
Contrasting the president's appeal
with Lincoln's "outright refusal, even
in the darkest days of the Civil war,
to apply any party test to fitness for
office," the colonel said that Lincoln
"appealed to all loyal men of all par
ties and asked that candidates for
congress he judged, not by the stand
ard of adherence to his personal ad
ministration, but by their uncondition
al support of the war."
Election of a republican congress,
the colonel continued, "would be un
derstood abroad as meaning that the
pro-Germans and pacifists and Bolshe
vikl and Germanized socialists could
no longer be counted upon as effici
ent and torturous tools, that the fight
ing men and not the rhetoricians were
uppermost."
Mr. Roosevelt interpreted the presi
dent's reference to the ''anti-administration"
attitude of republican mem
bers of congress, as based on "their
demand that inefficiency, waste and
extravagance be remedied" in the war
conducting department.

WASHINGTON. Oct. 28 While
Germany's latest note to President
Wilson was delivered to the state

from Europe brought information
that the Austro-Hungarian govern
ment has caused another communi
cation to be dispatch to the presi
dent asking that immediate nego
tiations for peace and an armistice
be entered into without awaiting
the results of the exchanges with
Germany.
The Vienna government asserted
that it adhered to the same point of

last communication upon the rights or

cially those of the Czecbo-Slovaks and

War Work Activity Will Start
Here With Appearance of
Dr. Robert P. Shepherd
With Message From Front
The first activities in the Warrea
district in connection with the United
war work campaign, the drive for
funds for the seven organizations
which are "taking horns to the boys
in the trenches" will take place Thurs
day, October 31. when Dr. Robert P.
Shepherd, overseas representatieve of
the Y. M. C. A., and Dr. Dean Emery,
a business man of New York now
working for the success of the cause,
will arrive here for a conference with
local representatives of the war
work -campaign; The two visitors will
remain throughout the day, and will
hold meetings with workers, speak
ers and others locally connected with
the drive.
Dr. Shepherd has been in France
almost continuously for the past year.
He is one of the most representative
of the men assigned to the Y. M. C. A.
forces abroad, and is one of the most
forceful speakers who has ever ap
peared in the west. At the recent
meeting of war work campaign speak
ers in Phoenix, Dr. . Shepherd deliv
ered several striking addresses, and
his message from the boys at the front
is a revelation of the wonderful as
sistance the seven allied agencies are
going the soldiers in France.
Dr. Emery is an attorney of New
York city. His special mission on
this trip is to instruct speakers in the
manner in which tbey Ehould appeal
to the public in the conduct of the
campaign in each community. He
speaks convincingly of the war, de
tails the work being done by eastern
cities, outlines the manner in which
speakers can best appeal to various
audiences and leaves with his audi
ence a vast amount of valuable in
formation and knowledge.
Dr. Emery and Dr. Shepherd are
the advance guard in the west of the
war work campaign. They speak and
talk of each of the seven allied agen
cies for which tli9 campaign is con
ductedthe Y. M. C. A., the Y. W. C.
A., tho National Catholic War Council
(Nights of Columbus), the Jewish
Welfare board, the War Camp Com
munity service, the American Library
association and the Salvation army.
The two speakers have already visited
most of northern and central Arizona
and New Mexico and westj Texas, and
following their meeting' here will
continue on their trip toward the
Atlantic coast.
Dr. Shepherd brings a message di
rect from the trenches. He speaks
both of and for the soldiers. He tells
how the American army Is behaving
in France, how they fight, how they
play, and of their overwhelming home
sickness. "Our boys are not only the best fed
and the best clothed the world has
ever known," he told his audience in
Ffcoenix. "but they are the best be
haved army the world has ever known.
Our men are setting a standard for
soldiery for the whole world. There
are two great things which the minds
of the French are unable to compre

Germans, and how our boys from the

CLERY-LE-GRANDE CLEAR.
WITH THE AMERICAN ARMY
NORTHWEST OF VERDUN, Oct. I S.
(By the Associated Press.) Night
patrols reported early today that
t'lery-Le-Grande had been cleared of
the Germans.
Farther west observers reported
that the enemy was digging in in the
region of the La Dhuy farm east of
the Bois Des Hazois.
Aerial photographs taken within
the last few days indicate that the
Germans are not devoting much labor
organizing their 'ront line or forward
positions, leading t the belief that
they possibly will fall b:ick upon as
yet unidentified positions in the rear
if they are compelled to do so. Fne
photographs show -hat even existing
trenches have not teen wcrkod over.
The work has been limited to fos
holes and organized shell holes.
The enemy prqbably intends to de
fend his position chiefly by taking ad
vantage of the natural features of the
terrian.
Experts figure that i: is the inden
tion of the Germans to delay any ad
vance of the Americans and if-nier
such advance as costly as pos&iole by
covering the Landres-St. Georges ridge
from positions immediately behind it,
basing their defense on the dominat
ing ground to the north and west and
taking advantage of the hills and
woods on other parts of th front

WASHINGTON, Oct. 2S Both influ

increase at army camps during the
48 hours ending at noon today, the
cause being ascribed by the surgeon
general tonight to the arrival of new
men at camps in the south and south
west. Sunday's total of influenza cases
jumped to 248S from the low record of
1602 reported Saturday, and there was
a further increase today of 2S31 cases.
Pneumonia cases Sunday were 41)5
against 396 the day before. Today's
figure was 431, a slight decrease from
Sunday. Deaths, however, continue to
decline with 193 Sunday and 184 to

after all are matters to be dealt with
in connection with peace and not in
arranging an armistice. A strong dis
position is evidenced officially to yield
to the apparent intent of both Ger
mans and Austrian negotiations to
continue these two essentially differ
ent functions in one phase of the ne
gotiations. In the case of the Austrian com
munication now supposed to be on its
way to Washington through the me
dium of the Sweish government it also
was noted that the effort was made
to show that Austria has complied
with the president's demand for the
recognition for the rights of the
Czecho-Slovaks and Jugo-Slavs and
other oppressed nationalities in Au
stria. It does not appear that the
complete independence of these peo
ple has been guaranteed and probab
ly sufficient assurance must be had
on that point before the Austrian pro
posals will be transmitted to the en
tente powers for submission to the
military experts.

Mr. Andrew Baumert, Jr.,

Dear Sir:
We are in receipt of your telegram advising us
that Mr. Hayden is endeavoring to discredit the National
Security League through a letter which he is publishing in
your newspapers. We are obliged for the information.
We have no doubt that the wisdom and conscience
of the good people of Arizona are fully equal to a correct in
terpretation of the facts. An adage sometimes humorously quot
ed by lawyers is to the effect, "When you have a weak case abuse
the other side." We do not believe that any man who voted against
the preparedness principles enumerated in our chart, and
who also voted against the principles of selective conscription
without which the United States would have had a "contemptible '
little army" compared to what it has can expect a constituency
made up of American Americans to regard his -candidacy
with favor.
Please do not misinterpret this letter as an aid
to the Republican party in Arizona, or anywhere else. We are
writing similar letters daily about Republicans in other parts
of the country.
Very truly yours,
CM AS. D. ORTH,

PARISIAN PAPERS COMMENT.
PARIS. Oct. 28. As to the request
of Austria-Hungary for a separate

the Paris papers that Count Andrassy,
the new Austro-Hungarian foreign
minister, represents nothing but a
nomination by the Austrian em
peror. "If." says the Journal Des Debats,
"Secretary Lansing replies, which !s
not certain, it will be easy for him
to say: 'There is no occasion to pur
suo the subject as neither Austria
Hungary nor a common minister of
foreign affairs exists.' "

result of other negotiations," the

"In these words the son of the min
ister who concluded the AuBtro-Ger-raan
alliance gives official noti
fication that the alliance has been
torn up.'
"With a government that flatters
itself it still exists in Vienna with
that in Berlin and with that in Con
stantinople," the newspaper continues,
"the only question at the present mo
ment can be to take military guaran
tees and not negotiate territorial or
political stipulation."
COMMENT ON NOTE
(By Review LeaMd Wire)
PARIS, Oct. 28. Commenting on
the German reply, the Temps remarks
that President Wilson did not ask for
a reply, adding:
"His note virtually ended with the
word 'capitulation.' Dr. Solf accepts
everything without wincing and be
gins his reply with placid banality.
The German reply is another attempt
to confuse the question of an armis
tice with the question of peace."

the windless on the big motor truck
coiled up the steel cable and the gas
bag was pulled down. Luke kept hov

hauled the drachen off to Its bed.
The crew assembled, seized the guy
ropes and anchored the big bag in its
usual nest.
Getting a Balloon.
Luke flew off to the eastward, then
started a long lightning like dive to
ward the drachen on the ground. He
sped directly over the wood and just
as the German machine gun started
spitting at him furiously, he let drive
with both guns. There was a short,
sharp explosion, a puff of black
smoke, a flare, and the balloon in
the ground disappeared. He had shot
it in its bed.
Perfecting his method of attack.
Luke continued to shoot them in their
beds and to turn his machine guns
on the Huns of the crew and to shoot
up the big motor truck windlass,
dropping small bombs around it when
ever he had the chance. Then he flew

Clean out the excess acid from your stomach it
creates -poisons that drag you down, rob you of
physical power and vitality, make you sickly, weak
and unfit.
It's just excess acid superacidity that's ailing
you. Learn what it must mean to have in your
stomach excess acidity so powerfully destructive as
to be able to create almost any ailmept. For years
dentists have been telling you that it's acid that
eats off the hard enamel of the teeth and decays
them. Think, then, of how much easier it must be
for an excess amount of acid to play havoc with the
delicate organization of the stomach. Just imagine
how one must feel how weak, unfit, tired run
down and sickly when acid-stomach gains control!
Also, what small chance one has of the recovery
of robust" health, happiness or success, if this acid
is permitted to remain, creating greater and ever
greater inroads on your health and strength day
after day.
You must remove the excess acid if you want
perfect health and strength.
Health that knows no aches or pains anywhere.'
that gives life a new zest and makes it really worth
wJiile. What unspeakable joy it is to have health
like that! How you live every minute of the day!
How soundly you sleep at nieht and how refreshed
you feel in the morning! How keenly you felish
your meals with what enthusiasm and bounding
energy you plunge into the day's work whether it
calls for muscular activity or mental keenness or
both!
That is the kind of health we all want and should
have. It is your heritage. So don't let an acid
stomach deprive you of your health. Don't let it
hold you back. Take the superacidity acid-stomach
out of your system and back comes health,
strength, vitality. Why? Because, by getting rid
of the excess acid, you will be able to get the full
strength out of the food you eat.
Some people think an acid-stomach merely
causes indigestion, dyspepsia, bloat, heartburn,
etc. That is a grave mistake. You simply have no
idea of the long train of physical ills and awful
human suffering that are directly traceable to acid
stomach. Rheumatism, Gout, Sr-iatira, Cirrhosis of
the Liver, Billiousness. Anemia. Auto-intoxication,
Intestinal Coneestion, Severe Headache. Insomnia,
Nervousness. Menial Depression, Melancholia. Diz
ziness, Heart Trouble yes, even Catarrh. Ulcer and
Cancer of the Stomach all of these disorders can
find their original source in that one condition
acid-stomach superacidity.
So often you have heard the remark: "I've taken
all sorts of tonics and medicines aud tried many dif
ferent doctors but nothing seems to help me."
About nine times out of ten, people making such
a remark suffer -from acid-stomach. Itemove that
excess acid and the results are truly wonderful.
Health and strength return almost like magic.
You can now rid your stomach of its excess acid
with a wonderful modern remedy called EATONIC
which literally wipes it out. It does the work easily,
speedily and thoroughly. It makes the stomach pure,
sweet, cool and comfortable. It helps you get full
strength out of every mouthful of food you eat;
and unless you DO get full strength from your food
you cannot enjoy robust, vigorous .health.
Try EATOXIG and see how quickly it banishes
the immediate effects of acid-stomach bloat, heart
burn, belching, food-repeating, indigestion, etc. See
too, how quickly your general health improves
how much more relish you take In eating how
much more easily your food is digested 'how soundly
you sleep how nervousness and irritability disap
pear. It is so easy to get this help and it costs so
little. So why Fuffer another hour when sure, quick
relief is at hand? Everywhere people who have
used EATONK! testify to Its power to bring quick
relief. The testimonials of some of these people
are so enthusiastic and tell of such remarkable re
sults as to be almost unbelieveable.
If you are one of those who have "tried every
thing," but in spite of it are still lacking in physical
strength and vigor, begin at once to take EATONIC.
Don't put it off. Get back your physical and mental
punch. Have the power and energy to work with
vim. Enjoy the good things of life. Learn what
it means to fairly bubble over with health. Like
thousands of others, you will say that you never
dreamed it possible that such a wonderful change
for the better could be broucht about so quickly.
So get a big box of EATONIC from your dmgeist
today. We authorize him to guarantee EATONIC
to please you and you can trust your druggist to
make this guarantee good. If it fails in any way,
take it back he will refund your money. If your

LONDON, Oct. 28. The British
troops, overcoming stiff opposition,
advanced their line today south of
Valanciennes, according to Field Mar

tonight. The other sectors were quiet.
The statement says:
"As a result of a local operation
carried out by us this morning south
of Valenciennes we advanced our line
between the Rhonelle river and the
Scheldt in the face of considerable
opposition and captured more than
100 prisoners.
"On the remainder of the front
there was nothing of special interest."

ROME. Oct. 28. More than 9,000
Austrians were taken prisoner In op

day, according to the war office an
nouncement today. Fifty-one guns
were also captured.
The Italian and British troops have
crossed the Piave river, notwithstand

LONDON, Oct. 25. British troops

(By the Associated Press. 11 p. m.)
The British launched a local' attack
this morning south of Valenciennes.
They improved their positions and
drew closer to the town, which is in
fested 'with enemy machine guns.
On the rest of the front it was com
paratively quiet.
Lilly today is celebrating their de

EXPLOSIONS BEHIND LINES
BRITISH HEADQUARTERS IN j
FRANCE. Oct. 28. via Montreal, (Reu-
ters.) South of the Mormal forest, on
the British front . south of Valencien-1
nes fires were observed today behind
the German lines in the neighborhood
of Landrecies, Marovilles and Sarbres.
A heavy explosion took place at Cre
pilly, probably from an ammunition
dump.
Between Valenciennes and Le Ques
noy British patrols have found La Folc
farm evacuated but the Germans are
holding their positions near Mare
sches in strength and are digging in
on the high ground in the direction
of Presecu.
The comparative slowness of the
general British advance in the last
few days has been due quite as much
to the necessity of making good roads
and renewing bridges as to the enemy
opposition.

To a Doughboy
I watch you slog down a dusty pike.
One of many, so much alike.
With a spirit keen as a breath of flame,
Ready to rise and ready to strike
Whenever the fitting moment came;
Just a kid with a boyish grin.
Waiting the order to hustle in
And lend your soul to the battle thrill,
Unafraid of the battle din
Or the guns that crash from a hidden iiill.
. -
I watched you leap to the big advance,
With a smile for Fate and Its fighting chance,
Sweeping on tin the charge was done;
I saw your grave on a slope in France
Where you fell asleep when the fight was won;
Just a kid, who had earned his rest
With a rifle and helmet above his breast.
Who proved, in answer to German jeers.
That a kid can charge a machine gun nest
Without the training of forty years.
I watched the shadows drifting by
As gray dusk came from a summer's sky.
And lost winds came from beyond the fighL
And I seemed to hear them croon and sigh;
"Sleep, little dreamer, sleep tonight;
Sleep tonight, for I'm bringing you
A prayer and a dream from the home you knew;
And I'll take them word of the big advance.
And how you fought till the game was through
And you fell asleep in the dust of France."
Stars and Stripes, France.
The Real Danger
This column views with ever growing
suspicion, disapproval, and even alarm, the
tendency of the man in the White House
in Washington to write notes. His last
two answers to Germany, while strong
enough, and apparently straight and clear
enough on their face, bear germs for much
future trouble for all those warring against
Germany. To answer Germany at all was
to err. She is not entitled to an answer.
Her course, before and since she appealed
to this nation for peace, has been such as
to bar her from any intercourse with a
civilized nation. For Wilson to name terms
at all or to pose as one who would submit
terms to the allies is to appear as a judge of
terms, rather than as an ally fighting to win
the war. What can we know of the agony
of France and the sacrifice of England dur
ing the four years of the war ? We have only
just begun. It is not for us to discuss peace
with the Hun. Our people generally are
opposed to such discussion. Wilson has
done and said some fine and great things
in this war, but the trouble is, he says too
much. He likes to write notes and to make
; speeches. He made a fine plea when he
urged that politics be kept out of the war,
and then he spolied it all, the other day,
by dragging them back into the very mid
dle of it. He has appealed for a demo
cratic victory next month and a democratic
congress to back him. The republican con
gressmen have a better record, man for
man, in backing him than have the demo
crats. This nation is engaged in a life and
death struggle in a great world war and its
entire power is behind President Wilson.
He represents the nation today and has
been vested with powers of speech and ac
tion far byond the head of any republic in
; the past. But this nation wants this war
fought to a bitter funish with Germany
paying the price in full for her crimes. This
nation expects every effort to be made to.
. work hand in glove with France and Eng-
land in all things for the winning of the
war. It expects the president to use his
utmost endeavors and tact and good sense
and skill t prevent dissention at home and
abroad. Hence its tendency to view with
alarm his tendency to treat with Germany
at all via the note route, and his turn to
wards politics at a most critical time.
The temptation of every good republic
an editor of the land now will be to resent
and to reply to President Wilson's political
plea for a democratic congress. Don't do
it. Be big enough and patriotic enough and
steadfast enough to press on with the war.
Vote for and support the men for congress
hat you believe are true blue to the Ameri
can cause. It is not the complexion of their
politics but the absence or presence of that
yellow streak that counts. Democratic as
well as republican congressmen have failed
in the pinch under the acid test of patriot
ism. Every present member of congress
on the defensive ought to be beaten, what
ever his politics. If he was not strong enough
and aggressive enough in his vote and voice
and action on ALL matters leading up to
and during the war, he is not the man to
send back to congress now. In Arizona
our own congressman, Hayden, is on the
defensive, to say the least. His vote on
many vital war issues was wrong. His op
ponent is now fighting in France. Enough
said.
You have heard nothing else for three
years but the breaking of the Austrian
morale, and in the past month or so Aus
tria has gone to pieces completely and been
starved to death and broken by strikes and
revolution. But when the Italians and the
British struck last week on the Piave they
found the Austrian morale in pretty fair
shape. After two days of hard fighting
only small gains were made and the Aus
trians counter attacked in the same old
way. The Hapsburgs are still on the job
in Austria and their soldiers are fighting
for them in the same fashion as of yore,
and the Hohenzollerns are on the job in
Germany, too, and they still have about
two million men on the western front that
are full of fight. Allied troops are earning
their gains, foot by foot. The tide has
turned, it is true, thank God, but the war
is yet to win, and the quicker we ail face
this fact and realize all that it means, the
better it will be.
Be ye not deceived, either by president,
prince or potentate. Unconditional surren
der is the only terms upon which this na
tion consents to end the war. Preach it,
practice it, proclaim it; think it, feel it, act
it, breathe it. Keep it before you as a light
and hold it as a staff and carry it as a
buckler against all the darts and devices
of the devil and his demons. This is the
most dangerous period of the great war.
Germany is trying to separate the allies by
dissention. This nation has already fallen
partly into her snare by opening up a cor
respondence with her on a forbidden sub
ject. This is the time of peril, the time of
the truce with the Prussian. Hold firm.
Be stern now lest ye repent later. A white
peace, now, as a military writer declared
the other day, means a black future.
Reports of studied and detailed destruc
tion of farm house, village and tree and
well throughout the re-occupied lands of
France continue to come in. Houses and
churches have been mined and the time
fuses set with devilish cunning. The re
treating Germans are still carrying pff ev
erything they can stagger under and they
are breaking up household gear that they
cannot take with them. No wonder the
average citizen's gorge rises when it comes
to treating with the German government
for peace. ' It is declared in high allied cir
cles that certain German commanders, con
spicuous and notorious for their cruelties
and thieveries and wanton acts are slated
for courtmartial and the firing squad. Any
mercy shown to these devils will be mis
placed. By all means, let them pay for their
manifold crimes.
Those labor leaders who iare fighting
Amendment One Hundred, better known
as the new compensation law, are biting
off their nose to spite their face. That it
will prove a good thing for the laboring
man and for his family is as true as it is
that the sun shines, but for the sole reason
that the business interests of the state favor
it a certain element of labor feel constrained
to oppose it. Not one charge can its op
ponents bring against it. The proposed act
is the most liberal, the most fair and the
most plain ever advanced to the electors of
a state. If it is beaten the average man will
be the chief loser and the damage suit law
yer of a certain unspeakable class the chief
gainer.
With the state election only a week away
the democratic candidate for governor is
still standing pat on his nomination and
his candidacy regardless of law, constitu
tion, party or public opinion. It is a most
strange state of affairs and yet is after all,
the logical and natural result of the feud
and class hatred and prejudice and bad
leadership into which Arizona politics has
fallen. Hunt, the man who stirred the
witches' brew and fanned the bitter fires,
has everything to gain and nothing to lose
from the situation. A vole for Colter is
either a vote for Hunt's man or for Hunt.
The only way possible for Hunt to lose is
for Tom Campbell to win.
Amendment 100
Removes Antagonism Be
tween Employer and
the Workman.
Under the phesent law a contro
versy arises the moment a workman
is injured, between the injured work
man, or in case of death, his heirs
or representatives and his employer,
as to the nature and extent of the in
jury (in cases not fatal), and the
amount, if anj, to be paid by the
employer.
Under the proposed workmen's com
pensation law known as Amendment
100 neither the injured workman nor
his heirs or representatives in case
of his death will, after injury, come
in contact with or receive compensa
tion from his employer. Compensation
will be paid to him, or in case of
his death, to his beneficiary or de
pendents as ihe case may be, directly
from the tsate industrial accident
fund by the state industrial accident
board.
The Industrial accident board will
consist of three members appointed
by the governor by and with the ad
vice and consent of the senate. The
term of office of one member will
expire and his successor be appointed
every two years.
The industrial accident fund is cre
ated by premiums collected by the
industrial accident board from the em
ployers coming under the law. In
other words a state insurance lurnisu
ed at cost.
Amendment 100 is the most pro
gressive legislation offered the people
of any state along this line and should
receive the solid support of Arizona's
citizenship.
statements explaining or qualifying
them is neither straightforward nor
plain, but if construed in its probable
sense may and possibly most of these
fourteen points are thoroughly mis
chievous, and if made the basis of a
peace such peace would represent not
the unconditional surrender of Ger
many but the conditional surrender of
the United States.
Use Bulgaria as Precedent
"Naturally they are entirely satis
factory to Germany and equally natur
ally they are in this country satisfac
tory to every pro-German and pacifist
and socialist and anti-American so
called internationalist. The only peace
offer which we should consider from
Germany at this time is an offer to
accept such terms as the allies with
out our aid have imposed on Bulgaria.
"We should find out whtkt the presi
dent means by continually referring to
this country merely as the associate
instead of the ally of the nations with
whose troops our own troops are ac
tually brigaded in battle. If he means
that we are something less than an
ally of France, England, Italy, Belgium
and Serbia, then he means that we
are something less than an enemy of
Germany and Austria."

Colonel Roosevelt sent a telegram
to United Slates Senator Lodste in
which he embodied his comments on
President Wilson's reply to Germany.
The telegram follows in part:
"As an American citizen I most
earnestly hope that the senate of the
United States will take affirmative ac
tion against a negotiated peace with
Germany and in favor of a peace
based on unconditional surrender of
Germany. I also earnestly hope that
on behalf of the American people it

ciples of the president's address of
last January as offering a basis for

"Out of that story, they carefully
conceal the fact that Governor Hunt
was playing the good Samaritan. They
careiully conceal the fact that Hunt's

Hunt in the Northern Arizona Lead
er). Iu this paragraph, Senator Colter
was referrjng to the course of Hunt
in going on the ball of Charles W.
Kastner, a German alien enemy, tak
ing hiin into his home and putting him
on the payroll at the state prison in
violation of the constitution of the
state which he had sworn to uphold.
He was also deferring to the gover

P. Hunt has been to the I. W. W.'s in
the state of Arizona! He certainly
justifies the application of the term
to him in this connection. They had
full sway until the government started
in to round them up and put associ
ates of the governor like Grover Per

BY REVIEW
NLW YORK, Oct. 28. War news
was again almost wholly favorable to
lue peace group in today's stock mar
ket, but domestic politics imparted a
tir.f;o of pessimism which found its
outlet in intermittent selling for the
short account.
A general demonstration of strength
marked the broad opening, but much
of this was dissipated before the ex
piration of the first hour, largely as
a result of the further spectacular
course of certain specialties.
Chief among these was Mexican
Petroleum, which advanced lift
points, reacted 20 points and closed
at a gain Of Vt points. Related
shares, including Royal Dutch and
Texas company were also erratic
within more moderate bounds and
shipping and motors proved suscept
ible to pressure. United States steel
refiist?red a fractional gain at the
outset, declined almost 3 points and
ended at a loss of almost 2 points,
war shares making virtually no re
covery from their reversals of 1 to?
2ft points. More stability was dis
played by rails and coppers, the lat
ter denoting confident accumulation
yielding some of their gains at the
heavy close. Sales amounted to
975,000 shares.
Bonds were irregular, liberty 3fts
hardening after early recessions, for
eign issues Steadying. Total sales,
par value, aggregated $7,950,000.
Old U. S. bonds were unchanged on
call.
GRAIN MARKET.
CHICAGO, Oct. 28 New notes sent
by Austria and Germany relative to
an amistice brought about declines to
day in the corn market. Setbacks,
however, were partly offset by likeli
hood of an after-the-war demand for
cereals. Prices closed unsettled,
to 2ftc net lower, with November
125Si to 12376 and December 119
to 119. Oats finished a shade to ftc
down, and provisions varying from
50c off to a like advance.
Weakness which developed at the
opening did not become radical, and
had almost disappeared when word
came that Austria had accepted all
the views expressed by President
Wilson. Immediately a sharp freak
break ensued.
Oats followed corn, but within nar
row limits.
Strength of hog market lifted pro
visions. COTTON MARKET.
NEW YORK, Oct. 28 Today's cot
ton market closed barely steady at a
net decline of 52 to 68 points.

TO THE VOTERS
A report that I am using my present
office as deputy United States mar
shal to evade military duty is being
circulated throughout Cochise county
with a view to affecting my candidacy
at the coming election. That this is
a lie pure and simple can be proved
by communicating with my superior
at Phoenix. I have twice offered my
self for military service and on each
occasion these offers have been re
jected. 1 am not trying to sneak or beg my
way into the sheriffs office, and re
quest that the voters give my candi
dacy impartial investigation and not
take for granted any rumors that may
be circulated between now and No
vember 5.

The High
Food Value
of Candy
"IS CANDY REALLY NUTRITIOUS?
WHY, I ALWAYS THOUGHT IT
NEARLY ALL SUGAR."
This Is the mistaken impression that the
candy industry is striving to correct
Of course, there is sugar in candy but the total amount allotted
candy manufacturers by the U. S. Food Administration is less than
one-third pound per person per month..
Besides sugar, however, candy contains chocolate, milk, honey, nuts,
raisins, fruits, etc all highly nutritious and splendid fuel for the
system. '
Growing children crave candy because growing bodies require much
fuel.
Ask any solder why he ?att candy so eagerly and he will tell you
that it furnishes the energy and "pep" that he need.
A pound of chocolate creams of standard quality contains 2092 calories
of heat and energy as against 881 in cream, 695 in -ggs and 1090 in
beefsteak.
The Ut S. Food Administration recognizes the high food value of
candy. Don't deny candy to your children or yourself but eat It
In moderate quantities, remembering that if you eat too much others
may go with out.

Captain Burns Veteran of Navy
"And Pioneer Visits the District
Capt. Thomas Burns, a pioneer of
Arizona and for many years a resi
dent of Howie, was in the city Satur
day and a part of Sunday. He came
up here from Douslas, having arrived
there on Friday from Los Angeles,
where he has been for more than a
y?ar in the Soldiers' home at Saw
telle. Capt. Iiurns has been prominent in
the mining business in this county
since he came to Tombstone some 30
years a?o to take chau'e of some
properties in the Tombstone district
for parties who resided in 'hk-ago and
knew him there. After leaving Tomb
stone he turned his attention to the
Chiricahua mountains and located the
copper properties which went to tha
Chiricahua Development company.
Capt. Burns is yet a large owner in
these properties in which he has great
faith though the development com
pany failed to make a sucee3 after
spending many thousands of dollars
in development work.
Besides this property, Capt. Bums
is now the owner of good properties,
carryin? important Rold values in
the Dos Cabesas mining district, tea
miles from Bowie. He said today that
he is now on his way to Bowie to look
after this property.
Regarding his health now, he feels
that he has been cured and that he
will be able to attend to business and
will make his headquarters at Bowie.
Capt. Hums, during the Civil war,
was a captain in the navy on the
Union side. He was aboard the Cairo,
which was the first gunboat in the
world successfully idestroyed by a
mine. One of the incidents of the
destruction of the Cairo, is the fact
that after being blown up the boat
sunk within ten minutes and that no
lives were lost in spite of the fact
that all aboard jumped into the river
and while swimming to the shore or
to other gunboats they were shelled
by the enemy. Rear Admiral T. O.
Selfridge, who now lives in Washing
ton, was commanding the Cairio at
the time. Later in the war Capt.
Burns was commander of the Prairie
Bird, which was a gunboat carrying
nine guns. They were 24.30 and 32
Parrot rifles. It was while Capt.

Rear Admiral Milton, retired. Capt.
Burn1' and R?ar Admiral Mihon were
ensigns together upon the Cairo. Lur
ing the visit the a:imiral inquired of
Capt. Burns if he had received his
medal. Capt. Burns was surprised,
and said he did not know that he had
a model coming.
It will be remembered that con
gress authorized the issuance of l.itfiO
medals for gallant service during the
Civil war.
Capt. Burns, for his heroic rescue
of the passengers of the Divernon had
been voted one of these medals, but
had never received it. Congressman
Hayden, learning of this fact later,
made an investigation of the matter
at the secretary' of the navy's office.
Here were found on record the log
books showing the gallant record of
Capt.-Burns during the Civil war.,
When the location of Capt. Burns was
discovered his service medal was
issued to him. In sending him the
medal the secretary of the navy took
occasion to compliment Capt. Burns
for the service he had rendered dur
ing his period of enlistment.
This is probably the only service
medal issued to a citizen of Arizona,
and the people of Arizona are proud
of the fact that they have a citizen
who has rendered such service to the
country.
