Fight On Food Bill Centers

(By Review Leased Wire.)
w
'ASHINGTON, June 28.
The fight in congress'
over government con-!
trol of food and other neces
saries today virtually narrowed
to the question of prohibition.
The house control bill, as.
amended by the senate agricul-j
ture committee, was substitut
ed in the senate for its original (
draft and debate proceeded, j
Senator Lodge opening the!
prohibition contest with a:
speech in favor of continuing
the manufacture of beer and
wine. The bill as it now stands t
would prohibit the manufac-i
ture of all intoxicating bever-;
ages but empower the presi
dent to exempt wines.
Senators Johnson, of California, and ,
Kellogg, of Minnesota .spoke on the j
general features of the bill promising j
it their support as a war measure. i
Lapse of several days in general dis-
cussion before the prohibition fight j
develops in earnest is in prospect, j
There is pending a motion by Senator ;
Hardwick to send the bill back to the j
committee on the ground that prohibi-;
tion and other important sections are
f unconstitutional.
Beer and Wine Under Fire.
Senate sentiment Is said generally
to favor stopping manufacture of dis
tilled spirits so that the bill will cen
ter upon the beer and wines section.
Senator Chamberlain, in charge -of
the bill, said tonight that he hoped
general speech-making would end to
morrow and that the senate Saturday
wolud begin considering committee
amendments, expected to take sev
eral days. The prohibition sections
under such procedure would be
reached last.
Senator Johnson, opening the de
bate on the substitute bill, declared
its enactment necessary tt win the
war.
"America must make the sacrifice
in dollars and creature comforts with
in the next year, or she must make
thereafter the sacrifice in men and
then, ultimately, the sacrifice in ma
ternal things, as well," she said. "The
short cut to victory is organization,
and this organization can come only
with a concentration of authority. It

By Seven Enemy Craft,
Brings Machine Safely To

(By Review leased Wire.)
PARIS, June 28. Corporal James
Norman Hall, American aviator and
members of Lafayette flying squadron,
who has been reported killed in an
encounter with Gentian air planes, has
fortunately escaped death. . Though he
Is badly wounded, there are hopes jf
his recovery.
Hall was flying over the German
lines when attacked by a German bi
plane. After a hot encounter, seven
other German mahcines came to the
assistance of the biplane and in this
unequal fight Hall was shot through
the lung. He managed, however, with
great courage and coolness .to bring
his machine down within the French
lines. He fainted just before landing
but had strength enough and presence
of mind tt cut off the gasoline and
ease the landing, so that the machine
was not destroyed.
Hall was picked up and taken to the
Soissons hospital, where he is under
treatment. In addition to the wound
in the lung, he received a slight bullet
cut across the forehead. The doctors
are hopeful of his recovery. Hall is
considered one of the most daring
members of the Lafayette squadron.
He is a son of Mrs. A. W. Hall, of Col
tax, Iowa. i

w
ASHINGTON, June 2S.
Complete reports from
Major General Pershing
upon the landing of his
first expedition in France still
were lacking tonight and the war
department remained silent. The
delay may be accounted for by the
report that until today General
Pershing did not personally visit
the American encampment.
At the navy department reports
are awaited from the commander
of the convoy that accomplished
without a marring incident, so far
as known, one of the greatest
tasks ever assigned a naval force.
There was much discussion to
day as to when the American
forces will take over a part of the
great battle line in France.
Whatever plans have been made
in this regard are closely guarded.
No official of any branch of the
government would admit having
any knowledge on the subject.

known that a considerable period

adopted here today by the North

The resolution was adopted after
it had been asserted by Charles

fresh from the tropics or from the
Mexican border, must be careful
ly acclimated to prevent sick
ness. Admittedly the main purpose of
sending the force in the brief per
iod allowed to make ready and get
them across was political. It is
understood to be the sentimental
rather than practical arguments
advanced by members of the
French and British commissions
which influenced the Washington
government in despatching Gen
eral Pershing and his men.
The great need of the moment,
as explained by Marshal JofTre
and his British associates, was to
send a force with the flag at once
to show the people of France,
straining under the great burden
of war, that a friend was at hand.
There will be no let-up to the
efTect to keep the force now in

NEW YORK. June 28. Alexander
Berkman, anarchist, was "sharply re
buked by Judge Julius M. Mayer in the
United States district court here to
day when Berkman resumed the exam
ination of talesmen for the jury that
will hear testimony in his trial and
that of Emma Goldman on charges of
conspiring tt hamper the operations
of the selective draft
"I am not going to let you take up
interminable time to examine jurors,"
said Judge Mayer after Berkman had
propounded questions to which the
prosecution objected, as it had yester
day. "t pointed out to you, at your re
quest, what improper questions are,
and I do not propose to have you ask
them. I will not stand any more non
sense or any more delays. Let us
have nV more acting."
"Would you believe it to be a lawful
change if we had in this country a
revolution?" Berkman asked one man.
"We are not going into the discus
sion of revolutions here," said the
court, in sustaining the objection of
the prosecution.
Miss GVldman was then permitted
to examine the talesman. Her ques
tions included: .
"Would you be prejudiced against
the defendants to know that Emma
Goldman had devoted a large part of
her life to the emancipation of wom
en." "Do you believe in woman's equality
with man?"
"Would you be prejudiced against
Emma Goldman if it came out in the
trial that she advocated birth control
for the poor?"
Judge Mayer allowed the questions
to stand as fair.
The courtroom was closely guarded
by secret service agents and only per
sons with passes were permitted to
. enter.
A large crowd gathered on the out
side and one woman, who was said to
be a follower of Miss Goldman, broke
her umbrella over the head of a deputy

Still Firm In Refusal.
(By Review Leased Wire)
BUTTE, June 28. International un
ions affiliated with the American Fed
eration of Labor began an effort today
to settle a part of the labor troubles
of Butte, caused by strikes of the re
cently organized Metal Mine Workers'
union and 'of electricians of the Mon
tana Power company.
Since the electricians struck, the
boilermakers, machinists and black
smiths employed by the mining com
panies, and the mill and smelter men
of the reduction mills have struck in
sympathy. It is stated by the mining
companies that 15,000 men are out of
employment.
International officers are exerting
influence to bring an end to the
strikes, and it was stated the situa
tion had taken a more hopeful aspect
None of the strikes, it was said by one
leader, had the sanction of the Ameri
can Federation of Labor.
J. A. Taylor, of Seattle, organizer for
the International Union of Maphinists,
one of the national officers here, said
that he was acting as an adviser and
was not attempting to dictate to the
local union. Through his efforts the
machinists and electricians conferred
today.
With the exception of the' metal
miners' strike, all are based on the
electricians', and if that one is settled
the sympathetic strikes are expected
to be called tff.
Other international officials here in

INTRODUCING THE "WOBBLY."
Is the "Wobbly" the only brave man In the War
ren District?
Are the American citizens, men who are loyal to
the country of their birth or adoption, going to con
tinue to allow a nefarious element known to be in
imical to good government and everything good gov
ernment stands for to make of them cowards?
Are the men of Bisbee, the men who quit their
jobs because the "Wobbly" element asked them to
do so, "yellow?"
Law abiding, home loving people of the Warren
District are face to face with a situation which de
mands clear-thought, intelligent action. It is no
ordinary labor trouble; it is an effort on the part of a
few men to paralyze the copper production and, in so
doing, to cripple the people of the United States at a
time when such acts constitute treason, in fact if not
in name.
The good people of this camp, the people who are
willing to "stick to their guns" and aid their country,
now at war, are carrying the load for those men who
seem too "yellow" to do their part. It is rank heresy
to preach labortem, now in Bisbee. The large pro
portion of the men who have left their jobs realize
this. They have merely allowed themselves, through
intimidation, to become the wilful pawns of a giant
conspiracy, the object of which is of far greater im
portance than appears on the surface.
These men, who ordinarilly, constitute good, loyal
Americans, are failing; to "come through." They are
either "yellow" or are participating deliberately, in
a movement which is distinctly un-American, un
patriotic, treasonable. They .should be brought to
this realization.
Any organization in the Warren District that can
successfully undertake such an education of the men,
who are quitting and leaving, would be doing a pat
riotic duty. Any method persued would warrant the
end that of cleansing the community of an ulcerous
growth which is sapping the vitality of our people
and our country.
Surely, it can't be said that the "Wobbly" is the
only brave man in the Warren District!
VENIZELOS TO THE RESCUE.
Eleutherios Vcnizelos. the strong man of the Balkan
States, and by many regarded as one of the foremost
statesmen of he present day, has been invited by Alex
ander I, of Greece, to form a new cabinet and undertake
the reconstruction of Greece along national lines. That
M. Venizelos will make the attempt and will be successful
appears likely.
Venizelos was born on the Island of Crete. He is fifty
three years old and in the prime of life. After studying
in the schools of Canea and Athens, he entered the Uni
versity of Athens where he graduated in law in 1886. He
returned to Crete, soon making a reputation for himself
as a brilliant lawyer. At twenty five years of age he
was chosen a member of the Cretan legislature and ren
dered conspicuous service during the Cretan revolution
in 1890-92. In 1898 he was appointed minister of justice
and in that capacity reorganized the laws of the island.
The Cretan lawyer was known for his cousistaot work
for the union of Crete and Greece and In 1910 moved to
Athens at the insistence of the military league. He aided
in the constitutional reforms of Greece after his arrival
there and won for himself a high place in the counsels
of the kingdom.
Venizelos was largely instrumental in organizing the
Balkan league, having been premier of Greece for some
time under King Constantino. At the London conference,
which closed the war. successfully waged against Turkey
by the league, he was the dominane spirit At the out
break of the Balkan war he was prominent in the forma
tion of the league against Bulgaria and was the dominant
figure when the treaty of Bucharest was signed.
At the beginning of the present European war, Veni
zelos cliampiotied the cause of the Entente. In this he
was opposed by the King. He resigned as premier and
was recalled. His policies, which were undoubtedly the
popular ones' with the proletariat, did not meet with favor
from the King and he again left the cabinet. At one time
during the troubles of Greece Venizelos abked his fol
lowers to stay away from the polls. The result was that
one third of the normal vote was cast.
When Bulgaria entered the war against Serbia,, Ven
izelos demanded of Constantine that the Greeks keep
their treaty with Serbia. The King refused and again
Venizelos went into retirement.
Affairs moved fast in Greece after that Constantine
lost ground with bis people and with the world. The
Entente, finally, demanded his abdication and constitu
tional Greece; a Greece which will keep its obligations
with other nations, was the outcome.
Venizelos may be expected to do the impossible for his !
country. Undoubtedly, he will be supported by the Allies
and bis course will be s popular one with his people.
Greece may be reasonably expected to come into its own
among the smaller nations of the world under his able
and statesmanlike leadership.
PIMA COUNTY'S ROADS.
Now that Santa Cruz county iias taken notice of the
squabble that Is raging in Pima over the road question
and since Cochise county is interested in the same way
as Santa Cruz, it may be pertinent to point out some of
the pitfalls of road building and road administrations.
In the first place Pima county, or especially that part
embracing Tucson, bad a wonderful Idea that by the
construction of a road to Ajo the business of that new
mining camp would be "corraled." It was decided to
build twenty six miles of road in the general direction
of the New Cornelia town. There it will stop. It will be
a good road but will begin someplace and end nowhere.
Ultimately the road will be continued to Ajo and will
tben go to Yuma and. to the coast. It will then consti
tute a valuable highway, but not until. Furthermore it
will have no large commercial advantage for Tucson
until it is conencted with the California roads at Yuma.
Another road is being constructed down the Santa
Crux valley. This is the bone of much contention m Tuc-,
son. It has also evoked some consicer&Die interest, in
Nogales. Much acrimonicus controversy has been raised
and a recall election appears to be in the air. It is all
over the selection of a route for the road.
During all of the argument the connection between
Pima county and Cochise county is being neglected. The
route along th Southern Pacific to Benson and thence
through Cochise county has been forgotten.
Cochise county will, In all probability, pass a million
dollar bond issue in the very near future. It will provide
for the construction of good roads from the New Mexico
state line to the Pima county line. It will provide, in
all probability, for a good road from the north to the
south, through the county. It will be built for service
and will be supervised by men who know and who will
get a dollars worth of road for every dollar of the bond
issue.
Pima county's experience with roads has been most
unfortunate. When the bond Issue was passed in that
county an engineering firm from the east persuaded the
board of supervisors that it woud be economy to have
such an organization in charge. Pima county was fooled
in its expectations and is now reaping Its own troub'e.
sowed when the original contracts were made.
The county highway commission, already appointed in
Cochise, will go a long ways to solve the difficulty. It
consists of five men. free from all politics, who want
roads; roads of the best kind for the money. Cochise will
not make a similar mistake to that made in the adjoin
ing county of Pima.

TOUCHY TUCSON.
The Tucson Citizen objects to the naval academy's
examining board putting the name Tucson in a list of
questions in a geography examination. Under the head
ing: "A Slam at Tucson," the paper printes the fol
lowing: "We see no reason why the professor of the United
States Naval Academy St AnnaP,is should pick on Tuc
son. This city was the first lu4be land to subscribe Its
quota to the Red Cross. It oversubscribed by many thou
sand dollars Us share of the Liberty Bonds.
The, navy department is sending out to newspapers a
sample of the examination papers for admission to the
Naval Academy.
"The first question in geography is one naming a num
ber of out-of-the-way places and asknig the applicant to
locate each and tell what it is.
"Here is the question:
Question 1. Locate the following and tell what each is:
(1) Aconcaqua; (2) Agana; (3) Bab el Mandeb;
Binhmamitra: (5) Oahu: (6) Darling; (7) Finisterre;
Fundy; (9) Kattegat; (10) Kenia; (11) Guantanamo;
(12) Monrovia; (13) Mukden; (14) Nipigon; (15) Pal
ermo; (16) Pechill; (17) Punta Arenas; (18) Scilly; (19
Tucson; (20) Yankton.
While an effort has been made to formulate a difficult
question by picking places which only students of Geo
graphy could locate, we have an idea that the applicant
breathes a sign of relief when he comes to Tucson for
here at least is one place in the number which everybody
has heard of.
Tucson. In our opinion, hasn't much comptainl coming
on the above list of uostions. Palermo. Finisterre, Brah
maptura, Oahu. Monrovia, Mukden. Scilly. Punta Arenas.
Kattegat. Fundy and several others are quite well known,
to say the least.
The complaint reminds us of the old story, told about
Bob Leatherwood. one of the early mayors of Tucson
but we will let Tucsou tell that story on herself. It
might be embarrassing printed in connection with the
Citizen's objection.

Mr. Editor:
You ask in this morning's paper,
"what are we going to do 'about' this
I. W. W. invasion." I will tell you
what I think should be done. The
citizen's protective league should call
public meetings, like the I. W. W. are
doing. They should appoint pickets
to go out along the roads and. be near
the I. W. W. pickets to give encourage-
careful, intelligent thought? If not
I do so at once and your conclusion
must be that all this trouble has orig
: inated in the minds of enemies to our
country.
It is a direct blow at our army and
;navy to which we are giving our sons;
and are we willing to send our boys to
the front while their idle fathers are
depriving them of munitions?
Our husbands have no real grievanc

ler and all around athlete of consider
able note, was arrested on the border,
where he had been plying the business
o selling art pillows to the soldiers.
He had a novelty in the way of photo
pillow covers that proved a big seller

be had unlimited access to the soldiers
quarters. Just what the specific charg
es were against him has not been
learned here.

A. H. Powers, editor of Yavapai Mag
azine, was yesterday appointed state

accountant before he came to Arizo
na. From the moment he came to
Prescott, Mr. Powers became an ac
tive worker for the republican party
and no sacrifice was too great or task
too arduous for him in behalf o" the.
cause. During the last campaign he
was the assistant secretary of the re
publican county central committee and
also secretary of the Tom Campbell
republican league In Yavapai county.
HEARING POSTPONED.
Hearing on the injunction, Stnte of
Arizona against Sidney P. Osborn. sec
retary of state, restraining him from
causing the women's minimum wa.e
law to be placed on the ballot for the
next general election, was postponed
until July 7, when called before Judge
Stanford in Phoenix. Neither side was
ready, so they said, the suit having
been filed only a few days ago, when
temporary injunction was issued
against Osborn. Whether Wiley E.
Jones, attorney general, should repre
sent Osborn or not was a question.
Jones said it placed him in a peculiar
position. It was suggested that the
attorneys for the people wishing th
minimum wage placed on the ballot lor
vote by the electors come forth to rep
resent Osborn. The whole matter was
left In abeyance until July 7. the day
set for the hearing.
GENERAL CALLES TAKES
OATH OF OFFICE
AS GOVERNOR
General P. Elias Calles, who took his
oath of office as governor of Sonora
last night, already has designated the
majority of the state's appointive of
ficers. Most of his appointees either
are In Hermosillo or enroute there.
Ygnacio Corrello, until recently
quartermaster for the Fourth Sonora
infantry division, has been named
state treasurer and left here early this
week for the state capital. Manuel
Acuna, foqmerly cashier of the cus
toms house at Naco. has been named
state treasurer by General Calles. He
also has gone to Hermosillo.
General Calles Is the one hope of the
American mining companies of the
state for straightening out the diffi
culties that have beset them recently.
Among his friends it is generally un
derstood Calles will devote the greater
part of his time immediately ater tak
ing office to straightening out the
muddle his predecessor has allowed to
come about.
The handwriting on the wall in this
particular is foreshadowed by editorial
comment in the last issue of "Malkri
ado," a Nacozari publication, which
seems to be considered as an official
Calles organ in northern Sonora. This
paper lays the blame upon ill-considered
action on the part of the state
labor congress and has begun a cam
paign for the new governor to set the
matter straight by intervening.
It Is rumored that General Calles
will ask the state legislature to elim
inate the labor congress, formed by
decree of Acting Governor de la
Huerta, and to take unto itself the
functions previously enjoyed by the
labor congress. In this way legisla
tion undoing what the labor congress
has done can be passed.

Prazil is no longer a neutral in the
world war and Germany has another
enemy arrayed against it.
Although no announcement has
been made as to whether the South
American republic will actually enter
into hositlities by its revocation of
neutrality it definitely aligns itself
morally on the side of the United
States and the entente.
The Canadians have taken another
hack at the German lines protecting
Lens and have been rewarded with a
further encroachment upon their ob
jective. Striking on a two mile front south
of Lens, they stormed and captured
German first line positions before Av
ion and also the village of Leauvette.
They defeated in their onslaughts men
ot the crack Prussian guard, and the
fifth Grenadier Guards, whose ma
chine gun and rifle fire though the fact
that the attacking force had to cut
through wire entanglements, could not
stay them.
When the battle ended and the Ca
nadians began their work of consoli
dating newly won positions their line
had been extended to within one mile
of the center of Lens, the fall of which
under such tenacious assaults as have
been made recently seemingly cannot
be long delayed.
On the front in France and Belgium
there have been only bombardments.
At St. George the Germans entered
French trenches but were later ejected
from them suffering heavy casualties.
In the Russian theatre the fighting
has l;een spirited in Galicia.
On the Austro-Italian zone infantry
activity has again ceased for the mo
ment and artillery duels are taking its
place.
PROHIBITION CLAUSE
OF FOOD CONTROL BILL
CENTER OFDISGUSSION
(Continued From Page One)
cording the most extraordinary and
autocratic powers ever befpr con
ferred in our nation." ..
Steel Company Flayed.
There must be sacrifice of profits.
just as there is sacrifice of blood, the
senator said, and he added:
"While, of course, legitimate enter
prise during the conflict should be
nurtured and encouraged, it must un
derstand from the very beginning that
no profitable patriotism will be toler
ated. If a concrete illustration were
required to demonstrate the necessity
for some sort of legislation in rela
tion to prices it is found in the recent
discussion concernring the steel corpo
ration. We find before the war this
corporation selling its product from
$21 to $25 a ton. At the beginning of
1916 its contracts for the delivery of
steel plates to commercial shipbuild
ing concerns was $42.56 per ton, and
very recently it asked from the United
States government $95 per ton.
"When an ordinary man sees his
loved boy snatched from his home to
be shot to pieces upon a foreign soil,
and reads of profits asked by a cor
poration created by his government of
$600,000,000 per year during the war,
he cannot be blamed for the demand
in which Our people unite and in which
the congress unites by the passage of
just such bills as this."
Hoover Is Praised.
Senator Johnson praised Herbert C.
Hoover and said he Is particularly
fitted for the task of food administra
tor. Senator Lodge, saying he would
vote for the bill after it had been care
fully considered, opposed some of its
provisions as amazing, and said "pub
lic excitement" for food control legis
lation Is pressing upon congress with
little public conception of the powers
the bill proposes to confer.
"The people Only know of its provi
sions in a general way," he said.
"Congress also must consider the peo
ple who are seeking more huge pow
er. More than one of the Caesars went
mad by mere possession of unre
strained power. We have pressure
constantly to give more power."
The Massachusetts senator opposed
particularly the proposal that Ameri
can industry shall sell to foreign na
tions as well as the American govern
ment at lower prices. He said the
minimum price fixing "holds over the
heads of all business and industry' a
deadly threat." and protested against
the exemption of farmers.
Lodge Against Prohibition.
Telling how New England dairy in
terests depend upon brewers' by-products
for cattle feed, the senator said
stoppage of brewing would send many
milk cattle to the slaughter house and
that it also would be likely to double
the price of bread by suddenly reduc
ing by 40 per cent the supply of yeast,
made largely from brewing products.
Germany, Senator Lodge declared,
has not restricted alcoholic beverages
In any way, while France gives her
soldiers regular wine rations. "And,"
he added, "I think nobody will dispute
that the German and French soldiers
are of good fighting quality. It is idle
to say that the men who drink light
wines and beer are undermined."
A huge red and white cross, to be
flashed from searchlights on war craft
at the navy yard will play by night
this week above the sky line of this
city as a reminder to citizens to con
tribute to -the Red Cross war relief
fund.
