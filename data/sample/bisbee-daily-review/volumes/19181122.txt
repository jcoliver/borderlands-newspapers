WASHINGTON. Nov. 21. The

objection.
Since the third and final session of
this congress will begin in 11 days
December 2 the adjournment today
was devoid of many of the spectac
ular features usually accompanying
the ending of sessions.
President Wilson did not go to the
capitol because no legislation requir
ing his action was passed by either
body, and only small groups of mem
bers and spectators waited for the
falling of the gavels of Vice-President
Marshal and Speaker Clark.
Very little business was transacted
in either house during the day, most
of the senate's time being taken up
In spirited debate, while the house,
after passing tee adjournment resolu
tion, recessed until 5 o'clock. The
usual committees from the senate and
house waited on the president and
were 'advised that he had no 11th
hour communications to make.
The debate in the senate was mark
ed by an attack on President Wil
son by Senators Watson of Indiana,
Sherman of Illinois and Kellogg oi
Minnesota, republicans, who voiced
objections to his action in taking over
cable and express lines, and an ad
dress by Senator Reed, of Missouri,
democrat, vigorously opposing the
plan for a league of nations. No re
ply to the republican criticism was
made from the democratic side, al
though Senator Lewis of Illinois, dem
ocratic whip, sought, but failed to
secure recognition. The proposal for
a league of nations, however, was
defended by Senator Phelan of Cali
fornia, democrat.
During the day congress formally
completed and sent to President Wil
son a bill for war time prohibition,
effective July 1 next. The president
promptly signed the measure.
Other matters on which action was
taken before closing gavels dropped,
were confirmation of the appointment
of former solicitor general, John W.
Davis, an American ambassador to
Great Britain and indefinite postpone
ment by the senate privileges and
elections committee of action on the
resolution proposing a contest of the
election of Truman H. Newberry, re
publican, as senator from Michigan.
Except the war revenue bill, little
business was left unfinished by con
gress which turns now, for the new
session from the problems of war to
those of peace and reconstruction.
During the 10 day period before the
new session opens, the senate finance
committee will endeavor to complete
revision of the revenue emasure, while
the house committees work on the
mass of appropriation bills to come
before the next session which expires
by limitation next March 3.

REVENUE BILL
I
In Line With McAdoo's De
sires Would Levy Six Bil

lions in 1920.
(By Review leased Wire)
WASHINGTON, Nov. 21. A detail
ed plan for revising the pending war
revenue bill, so as to impose taxes
and provide revenues aggregating
about $6,000,000 next year and $4,000.
000,000 in 1920 in line with Secretary
McAdoo's recommendations, was sub
mitted today to the senate finance
committee by Chairman Simmons.
A decision on the plan was deferred,
but a vote may be reached tomorrow.
Republican members vigorously op
posed the proposal to establish 1920
tax rates in the measure, but Chair
man Simmons said they were advised
that if they obstructed passage of the
bill with the majority's plan to pro
vide 1920 taxation, a straight levy of
SO per cent on war profits, to furn
ish the government necessary rev
enues, will be put through.
Senator Simmons' plan to reduce
the bill to $6,000,000,000 for 1919 pro
poses retention of the house rates on
incomes and war excess profits, ex
cept the 6 per cent differential un
distributed corporation earnings;
elimination of the 20 per cent tax on
luxuries and retention of other special
miscellaneous taxes, but all rates not
to exceed an increase of one-third
over those of the existing law.
For 1920 Senator Simmons' plan
contemplates abolishing the war prof
its tax, reduction of individual and
corporations' normal income rates
from 12 to 8 per cent and reduction
"by about one-third In the excess prof
its schedule as now proposed in the
revised committee draft. Also the
special miscellaneous taxes would be
continued at the 1919 rates.
Loth plans for 1919 and 1920 as
presented by Senator Simmons, were
said to have the approval of the treas
ury department and also, generally, of
the democratic members of the fi
nance committee. Republicans indi
cated general satisfaction with the
1919 suggestions, but again opposed
the 1920 extension. Senator Sim
mons said the democratic committee
men are determined upon the 1920
plan, because- tJiey believe it Is un
wise to fix taxes only for 1919 with
out informing the busiuess world ofj
the ruture program.
The committee hopes to have the
bill ready soon after the new session
of congress convenes Decemler 2,
but the republican opposition and
other considerations, it was general
ly expected, may delay its enactment
until next January.
In his proposal for reducing the
bill to $4,000,000,000 for 1919 Chair
man Simmons took into consideration
the prospective loss of about $1,000,
400,000 as the result of the operation

WASHINGTON', Nov. 21. Presi

control and operation of marine cable i
systems and express agencies, .were
vigorously criticized today in the sen
ate by republican spnators, who snM j

The speakers were Senators Wat-

debate the president was criticized fori
his decision to go to Kurope, and '
George Creel, chairman of the commit-1
tee on public information, who it has
been reported, is to accompany Uie ;
president, also was attacked.
Senator Watson denounced the
president's action in taking over cable
lines as a breach of faith and charged j
that their control was inspired by a j
desire for government censorship ofj
dispatches during the peace confer-j
ence so that the representatives ofi

table may not know what is being
said in the Amercan congress about
the conference.
In the midst'of the debate, Senator
Lewis of Illinois, the democratic whip,
sought to reply to the republican sen
ators, but did not get recognition.
He did, however, offer a resolution
which would put congress on record i republic'

Senator Sherman said there might

going abroad, but that he could not
see it, and added, that no provision is
made in the constitution for the ab
sence of the president from the ter
ritoral limits of the United States.
The White. House, he said, will be
moved to Paris, and added:
"We are left to the tender mercies
of a censored cable, controlled by
Creel, as the dictator at the source
of action."
Senator Kellogg said there was no
war necessity for taking over cable
lines and express agencies as the
armistice has been signed and added,
that in his 'opinion, the action "is
part of a plan to fasten government
pwnership of telegraph, telephone and
cable lines on the country."

its legislative rider providing for na-:

The prohibition amendment to the ;
agricultural measure caused a long !
fight in the senate. Officials of the i
shipping board opposed its adoption j
on the ground that taking beer from I
shipbuilders would make for discon- j
tent which would be reflected in their .
work.
Secretary Daniels, who was called
before the senate com:ailtee holding 1
the hearing, combatted this theory,
saying that after sales of intoxicants I

J WASHINGTON, Nov. 21. Aside
from the personnel of the Ameri
j can delegation and the preparation
for President Wilson's journey to
France, interest here in the peace
conference centers on what nations
J -are to participate in the delibera
k ticms.
The entente powers and the United
States have borne the brunt of the
war and their representatives will
outline a plan of procedure for the
confeienee. These Dowers also will
determine the extent of the partici
pation of other nations which have
declared war on the central powers,
others which only severed diplomatic
relations, still others which observed
"a benevolent neutrality" toward the
associated nations, and finally, the
neutral nations which mliht seek rep
resentation on the ground that their
future will be vitally affected by the
expected declsious of the conference.
Each nation admitted to participation
in the conference will be regarded as
a unit.
The number of itj commissioners
or delegates will not matter, uor is
it expected that decisions will be re
corded on the basis of majority votes
of these units. If l;e usual ril s
.oterning m-h international gather
ings are observed ut Versailles and
officials here believe they will be.
no attempt will be made to bind min
orities to the opinions held by a ma
jority of the commissioners. Each
nation will be free to adhere to any
declaratiun of principles proposed to
the conference or to 'AitldiolJ its
assent.
In The Hague convention a number
of governments declined to accept
certain rules laid down, and others
did so only with reservations which
were set out with great exactness in
the protocol. Yet these divergent
views did not prevent the agreement
of the conferees upon the great gen
eral principles, the adoption of which
was the main object of the powers
which conceived and brought together
tiie international gathering.
Nothing has yet been officially an
nounced regarding the composition of
the American commission to the con
ference and one high official said to
day that nearly everything that has
been said on the subject is only
guesswork and that President Wilson
himself is the only person who knows
who will be the American representa
tives. It is . known, however, that
Secretary Lansing will head the
American delegation. It also was sail
today upon his authority that the
name of former President Taft. who
has been mentioned In connection
with the commission, could be elim
inated as a possibility.
Only a few attaches of the com
mission will be taken from the United
States, the entire personnel number
ing not more than 23 or SO persons.
Great pressure Is being brousht t
bear by persons who wish to attend
the conference to be admitted to the
party in one rapacity or another, but
word has gone forth from the white
house that the number must be re
stricted because ail needs of the com

actually engaged on the front 740
American planes, 744 pilots, 457 ob
servers and 23 aerial gunners.
Of the total number of planes, 329
were of the pursuit type, 296 were for
obseivation and 115 were bombers.
In addition, several hundred planes
of various types were being used at
the instruction camps when the war
ended.
Between September 12 and Novem
ber 11 the air forces operating with
the first army alone dropped 108,984
kilograms (about 120 tons) of high
explosives on the enemy lines and
supply depots and railroads behind his

WARNING TO HUN

Says Unless Inhuman Treat
ment of Prisoners Ceases,
Germany Will Forfeit Right
to Ask Clemency
LONDON. Nov. 21 ( British Wireless
Service). The Daily Chronicle says
"We are glad to see that our gov
ernment has wirelessed a stern warn
ing to the German government, re
garding the barbarous treatment of
British prisoners, who have been dis
charged without food and in rags
and sent to find their way for long
distances on foot to the allied lines.
"It ought to be made quite clear,
not only that any continuance of such
atrocities will forfeit the claim of
the German people to compassionate
treatment in the matter of food, but
that every German who had already
incurred responsibility for them will
have that responsibility brought home
to nim.by condign punishment.
The
case of wanton cruelty to war pris
oners is one in which failure to exact
retribution would be a betrayal of the
future interests of civilization.
"Posterity must have placed be
fore its eyes the record of stern ex
amples calculated to deter those in
charge of helpless prisoners from ven
turing again to commit savageries
which have been wreaked on our men
In this war by Germans, Bulgars and
Turks.
"The terrible stories of the Turkish
treatment of the captured Kut garri
son, now revealed to the public in ah
its horror by the official white paper,
points the same moral. Our govern
ment has in the past declared that it
would hold Enver Pasha (former. min
ister of war) and Talaat Pasha (form
er grand vizier) and their colleagues
personally responsible for the ill
treatment of wounded British prisoners.-
This declaration ought to be
carried out to the letter. Criminal
Turkish ministers, should without
more ado. be brought to public trial,
duly convicted, and hanged."

"If the United States would have a
single vote in the court," Senator
Reed said, "it would rank with Haiti,

settlement of questions vital to the
life of America.
"If we are to have greater repre
sen:ation, what becomes of the doc
trine of the equality of nations?"
Senator ReeJ then presented charts

Regarding the leaRue of nations.
Senator Reed said he did not know

treaty without resort to a league of
nations. In discussing the composi

ABOUT PRISONERS
PEACE CONFERENCE HAY BE HELD IN PALACE AT VERSAILLES
It is the general belief now that
the peace conference will be held
in the palace at Versailles. Iky
ing aside sentimental reasons,
Versailles stands out as the most
practical place, officials point out.
It is easily reached, from foreign
4 .
ands. Located in the Paris out
skirts it has ample wire and cable
service to the outside world. The
representatives of the leading gov-
would yield her mighty fleet?" he
asked.
"England would be the master na
tion of the world, and all other na
tions would be subject to her if she
so chose."
Europe, Senator Reed continued,
has often been in war because of the
haired of rival races and he said this
hatred will spring into flame "as long
as there are men and women on the
earth."
"The world war." lie asserted,
"misht be traced to this hatred."
Ambitions of France and Germany
to extend their borders and of Eng
land to place its power in every quar
ter of the world "are part of the blood
of the people," the senator added.
"In all this maelstrom of ambition,"
he contnued, "it Is proposed to thrust
the United States. It is proposed that
every time there appears a cloud on
the horizon of Europe that we shall
issue the draft, call our boys from
th farm, and pour out their blood
on controversies that do not affect us
one bit." i
The life of the republic may be at I
stake in the iss,iie. Senator Reed de-
clured. adding that the very founda-
tiou on which the republic stands ;s
involved
The policy of the friendliness of
the United States to South American
republics also Is involved, the speaker
sad, and added that It means the
giving of this government to European
kin.es. He declared he protested
against a policy "in the name of the
fathers of the republic and of the boys
of the nation."
Referring to the war. Senator Reed (
said he estimated that it would cost
the United States fifty thousand mil
lion dollars.
Senator Plirlan of California, in the
last ten minutes ot" the session of the
senate replied to Senator Reed. He
said that the Missouri senator's argu
ment that racial differences among
nations militates against such a plan I
is one of the arguments in favor ot
it. The freedom and democracy ac
corded to siiall nations of Europe
would be worthless, he declared, un
less some agency such as the league
of nations, is -created to protect them.
Replying to Senator Reed's state
ment that Ensiand would not partici

GREAT PAINTING FADES
MILAN, Nov. 21 (Correspondence of
the Associated Press). A Jieating ap
paratus powerful enough to force heat
through a pile of sand bags 12 feet
thick and to dy without scorching the
wall behind, is needed to preserve one
of the World's .masterpieces. ''The '
Last Supper." of Leonardo de Vinci,
which is painted on the wall r,f the
church of Santa. Maria delle Grazie
here. The dampness which accumu
lates in the sand necessary as a pro
tection from air raids is fast fading
the colors f thei picture, already
damaged by time.
The restoration necessary for Leon i
I ardo's picture is unsuited to the fres-
coes of Lulni and other masters paint
ed on the same wall. How to give
! each set of masterpieces the treat-
ment required and still guard asainst
the danger in the air is the problem.
So far the experts of the Italian Min
istry of Fine Arts have been unable j
to find a solution.

Suffering Described As Torture
Relieved by Black-DrangHt
Rossville, Ga. Mrs. Kate Lee Able, o!
this plane, writes: "My husband is an
engineer, and once while lifting, he in
jured himself with a piece cf heavy ma
chinery, across the abdomen. Ke was
so sore he could not bear to press on
himself at all, oa chest or abdomen. He
weighed 165 lbs., and feU. off until he
weighed 110 lbs., in two weeks.
He became constipated and it looked
like he would die. We had thr-e different
doctors, yet with all their medicine, his
bowels failed to act '."He would turnup
a ten-cent bottle of castor oil, and drink
it two or three days in succession. He
did this yet without result. We became
desperate, he suffered so. He was swol
len terribly. He told me his suffering
could only be described as torture.
I ssnt and bought Thedford's Black
Draught I made him take a big dose,
and when it began to act he fainted, he
was in such misery, but he got relief and
began to mend at once. He got well,
and we both feel he owes his life to
Thedford's Black-Draught."

Americans who have given their lives
in France have not died in .vain, among a
cold, unsympathetic race. This question is
set at rest by Irvin S. Cobb, in an article in
the current issue of the Saturday Evening
Post, in a manner that will bring comfort
to the hearts of those American mothers
and fathers whose sons have died "over
there."
Mr. Cobb, after describing a visit to a
cemetery in a large French city, where
several hundred of our boys have been bur
ied, tells how he found hundreds of French
women decorating the graves of the Amer
icans, while old men, evidently drawn from
all ranks of life, raked the walks and ar
ranged the tidy borders of sea shells which
marked each small plot.
An American general was explaining to
him how, on the day the first American to
die in that vicinity was to be buried, a
delegation of the town's most influential
residents had come to him and said the
town desired to adopt the American dead.
When asked for an explanation, the
spokesman said:
" 'General, there is scarcely a family in
this place where we live that has not given
one or more of its members to die for
France. In most cases these dead of ours
sleep on battlefields far away from us, per
haps in unmarked and unknown graves.
This is true of all parts of our country, but
particularly is it true of this town, which
is so remote from the scenes of actual
fighting.
"'So, in the case of this brave Ameri
can who today is to be buried here among
us, we ask that a French family shall be
permitted formally to undertake the care
of his grave, as though it were the grave
of one of their own flesh and blood who
has fallen, as he has fallen, for France and
for freedom. In the case of each Ameri
can who may hereafter be buried here we
ask ithe same privilege. We promise you
that, so long as these Americans shall rest
here in our land, their graves shall be our
graves, and will be tended as we tend the
graves of our own sons.
" 'We desire that the name of each fam
ily that adopts a grave may be registered,
so that, should the adults die, the children
of the next generation, as a sacred charge,
may carry on the obligation which is now
to be laid upon their parents and trans
mitted as a legacy to all who bear their
name. We would make sure of this, so
that, no matter how long your fallen braves
' rest in the soil of France, their graves shall
not be as the neglected graves of strangers
to us, but symbolically at least, may be as
the graves of our dead sons.
" 'We wish to do these things for more
reasons than one: We wish to do them be
cause thereby we may express in our own
small, poor way the gratitude we feel to
America. We wish to do them because of
the thought that some stricken mother
across the seas in America will perhaps feel
a measure of comfort and consolation in
knowing the grave of her boy shall al
ways be made beautiful by the hands of
a French woman whose home, also, has
been desolated. And finally we wish to do
them because we know it will bring peace,
to the hearts of the Frenchwomen to feel
they have a right to put French flowers
upon the graves of your heroic dead, since
they can never hope most of them to
perform that same office for theirs.' "
After describing the beauty of the scene
in the cemetery, Cobb continues:
"So I have set down the tale; and to it
I must add a sequel: Decoration Day was
months ago, and now I learn that the cus
tom which originated in this coast town
is spreading throughout the country; and
that, in many villages and towns where
Americans are buried, Frenchwomen
whose sons or husbands or fathers or
brothers have been killed are taking over
the care of the graves of Americans, be
stowing upon them the same loving atten
tion they would visit, if they could, upon
the graves of their men-folk."
EMBLEMS OF DEATH FOR TOYS
(Popular Mechanics Magazine.)
New York, Oct. 23. Several thousand
cases of German-made toys arrived here
today. Associated Press.
Toys! For whom? For the innocents
carried down when the "Lusitania" sank?
For those tear-eyed Belgian children who
stretch forth little arms from which the
hands were struck off by the swords of
German officers? For those French boys
and girls with pitiful, sightless eyes? For
those whose little bodies rest in the church
yards of Italy, that died in pain from pois
oned Hun candy For those other chil
dren slowly starved to death in Poland or
massacred in Armenia?
Toys? Toys made by Huns to whom
innocence and childhood are but toys to
play with and then crushed and broken?
Toys whose very contact contaminates and
leaves upon the touch ,of babyhood invis
ible clots of blood? As well bring a dead
ly serpent into the h6me to spew its venom
on the cradle. Why shall we befoul and
faint the ;purity of American childhood
with a reminder of the fiendish treatment
the Huns have gloried in ever since that
fateful August of 1 91 4? Can one even
look upon a Noah's Ark "Made in Ger
many" and put from his mind those hun
dreds of helpless innocents whose silken
locks are twined with seaweed? Can one
hold a German doll in her arms and for-,
get the thousands dead from famine who
once made glad a mother's arms? Can a
boy find delight in the contortions of a
mechanical Hun clown and forget those
brave young men who writhed in agony
when cruficied on castle walls by these
same Huns? Can a ball colored with the
red of Huns fail to suggest the flame from
bursting grenades hurled by arms uplifted
in the attitude of "kamerad"?
Let those who would invite fearsome
ghosts' into the home to hover round the
Christmas tree, buy German toys. If one
would hang the boughs with evil omens,
and bid the wail of agonized spirits float
through the branches and fan the flicker
ing flame of candles, let him buy German
toys. Let those who can, make merry with
the product of ,'those vetry hands which
even at this moment are eagerly filling
shells with poison gases and deadly flames
and hurling them against our own fresh
and blood.
And what of the merchant who, for sord
id gain would barter these souvenirs of a
loathsome nation and insult the loyalty of
lisping lips ? What could more delight the
cunning Hun, what more quickly bring the
sneering smile to cruel faces, or gladden
hearts, or encourage him to hope that even
now we tolerate his brutality and welcome
what he wants to sell? If now, when as
a nation we are in universal condemnation
of Hunism, yet do we hold out our hands
to accept his works, what will he think and
with what measure shall he estimate the
sincerity of our expressions of repugnance
and horror at what he has done since the
sun rose this morning? What mitigation
can we claim in the thought that America
was not yet overseas when these trinkets
were fashioned? Even while the gaudy
paint was yet fresh upon these trinkets
were Belgian girls being dragged into slav
ery worse than death.
We do not lack for toys; toys by train
loads made in American factories, by hands
which are clean ; toys also by carloads made
by our ally in Japan, where childhood is
sacred, and love, not hate, is taught at
mothers' breasts. Even were there none,
far better our boys and girls should go
without them than find pleasure in the
handiwork of a nation which made a pub
lic holiday to celebrate the loss of the "Lus
itania" and which in these latter days is
steeped in the "glory" of monstrosities.
Could our little men who sacrifice many a
childish pleasure to buy war stamps and
contribute pennies to the Red Cross, and
our little mothers who knit so patiently
with hands that can barely hold the needles,
would one of these knowingly find any
pleasure in any toy "Made in Germany" ?
By this time Trotzky and Lenine must
be having their anxieties, the royal market
for their particular style of services having
about disappeared.
Every now and then some English
speaking historian undertakes to compare
Wilhelm Hohenzollern to Napoleon, but
the French are too polite to notice it.
The kaiser lit a cigarette as he boarded
a train. Still clinging to the luxuries!
About the State
Phoenix: The Arizona tax commis
sion has been uotified that the annual
meeting of the national tax commis
sion will be held at the Planters hotel.
St. Louis, beginning December 16. The
meeting was to have been held No
vember 11, but was postponed on ac
count of the Influenza epidemic. It
will be attended by Chairman Zender
of the commission.
Phoenix: Assistant Director Gen
eral John R. O'Leary of the govern
ment employment service is in the
city today on a tour of the country In
which he is visiting offices of federal
directors of employment service. An
other official in town now is James
LorJ, chief of the mining division of
the employment service and president
of the mining division of the Amer
ican Federation of Labor. He is a
brother of Joe Lord, mediator of the
department of labor, who has been
spending several months in the state.
Phoenix: Leaving this morning for
San Francisco, O. W. Berry, state ex
aminer of the United States employ
ment service in Arizona, goes to the
office of the district superintendent of
the service, where he will receive in
structions as to conducting the finan
cial work of the Arizona employment
offices. On the 15th of this month the
office of district superintendent was
abolished and hereafter each state is
to attend to its own fiscal work, for
which the federal employment direc
tor is accountable directly to the di
rector general at Washington. The
administrative unit of the employment
service is now the state instead of the
district.
Phoenix: Problems of the recon
struction period will be discussed at
the meeting of the state advisory
board of the United States employ
ment Bervice next Saturday, and also
the necessity of extending the service
so that it will cover all the needs of
this critical period. The meeting will
probably be held in the new quarters
of the employment service in the Ma
sonic temple, across the hall from
where it is now located, if the rooms
are ready for occupancy at that time.
Two new members of the board, Mrs.
Pauline O'Neill of Phoenix, and Mrs.
Rosa McKay of Globe, will be present
for the first time since their appoint
ment a few weeks ago. The other
members are O. S. Stapley of Mesa,
and H. A. Clark of Douglas, represent
ing management, and Alfred Madden
and George D. Smith.

skirmish, another was found near
Guaymas with bis throat rut and his
head mashed in, and now Holmes kill

on a freight train. Truly a strange and
cruel fate seems to follow the slacker.
Tucson: Senators Ashurst and
Smith will be asked today by the
Tucson chamber of commerce to use
all the resources at their command to
secure from congress the contemplat
ed appropriation for the federal build
ing which it is proposed to build here
for the housing of the various
branches of the government service.
The report that the appropriation
measure, held in abeyance because of
war conditions, would be brought
again before congress inspired the ac
tion of the board of directors of the
chamber yesterday afternoon. Secre
tary Ray B. Leach was instructed to
lay the matter before the Arizona sen
ators. He will make a digest today
of data bearing upon the matter and
telegraph it to the senators. The site
for the federal building at the corner
of Scott and Broadway, has already
been turned over to the government
and the building would probably have
been started by this time but for the
outbreak of war.

Phoenix: B. M. Atwood, state engi
neer, was today officially notified by
the United States highway council
that there will be no further restric
tions in the matter of road work.
Where approval of projects has been
denied, the former action is rescinded
and where applications are pending
the work may proceed without further
notice. The matter of bond issues,
however, is still under control of the
capital issues committee and where
bond issues for road construction are
contemplated a permit for the issu
ance and sale of the bonds muBt be
secuied. Road work is restricted only
in the matter of steel supplies where
they are needed. Applications for steel
must be made subject to the govern
ment's requirements. The state engi
neer, however, has been assured that
he will be furnished with all of the
steel that the state will need in road
construction.
Phoenix: Squeezing through a hole
of such small dimensions as to seem
almost prohibitive for any human
body, Jesus Gonzales and Charles
Broad effect an escape from the city
Jail last evening. Both men were
being held on burglary charges. Gon
zales and Broad had been locked in
one of the cells in the feminine ward
of the jail for safe keeping. Some
time during the early evening hours
they broke off a portion of the wooden
window casing. They then tore away
a portion of the heavy steel wire over
the cell bars and through this opening
effected their escape. A bit of contor
tion was necessary to make possible
the escape, officers are convinced.
The hole through which the men
passed was only a trifle larger than
the ordinary space between steel bars.
Yet there was some evidence that
both men had bad some difficulty in
forcing their little bodies through the
aperture.
Tucson: Arizona is to have a state
medical library at Phoenix. Dr. O. A.
Turney. in charge of the Phoenix lib
rary, acting in conjunction with Dr.
F. H. Hedewell, of the State Medical
association, has started the organiza
tion of the medical library. Already
more than 1000 late medical volumes,
as well as hundreds of magazines,
have been collected. They are the
gifts of physicians. It is the inten
tion of the organizers to make the
library only temporary. Every doctor
in the state has been asked to lend
his work. The names of the lenders
are to be printed on ribbons, which
will l e placed in the books. By writ
ing to the library physicians and sur
geons can obtain abstracts, written by
competent clerks, on any medical sua
ject. It Is the intention of the or
ganizers to develop a circulating lib
rary that will place magazines ana
late authoritative works in the hands
of all members of the state associa
tion, a system similar to that em
ployed by the medical corps of the
United States army. .
al Christmas holidays will be cur
tailed to "a few days."
For length, bulk of appropriations
for the war, and the number of Im
portant legislative measures passed,
the session which closad today was
regarded by leaders as unprecedented
At this session was was declared on
Austria-Hungary and the members
also saw the victorious end of all hos
tilities. Appropriations passed aggregated
S3G.29S.0O0, making the total for this
congress more than 45 billion, of
which $19,412,000,000 was appropri
ated at the first an extra session at
which war was declared on Germany.
Legislation passed included bills
authorizing billions of Liberty bonds;
creation of the war finance corpora
tion; government control of telegraph
telephones and cables; executive re
organization of agencies, and exten
sion of espionage act and the army
draft law. by which men between IS
and 45 years of age were required to
register.
President Wilson addressed con
gress several times during the session.
The first sptech was on January8,
when he outlined bis fourteen peace
principles. On May 27 he asked for
immediate work on the war revenue
bill and on November 11 read the
terms of the armistice.
Prohibition and woman suffrage
furnls-'ied sharp controversies
throughout the session. The war
time "dry" measure was completed,
but after the woman suffrage consti
tutional amendment resolution had
been adopted January 10 by the house.
It was defeated in the senate by two
votes. It Is expected to come up
again next month.

BY REVIEW
.LW YORK, Nov. 21. Erratic
,r.ic changes attended today's stock
market, trading falling to the lowest
je!io in several weeks until the last
Hour, wnen an aime sewing move
ment effaced numerous gains.
Until that period even the profes
sional element seemed disinclined to
take even a temporary stand, pend
ing partial readjustment of existing
uncertainties, but the weght of the
later offerings was too great to over
come. Moderate strength in the early and
intermediate stages of the session was
attributed to prospects of less strin
gent money conditions after next
week's heavy payment on the fourth'
Liberty loan. This possible relaxa
tion was not expected to apply -to
time funds, the paucity of which is
likely to extend over the year's end.
Coppers were exposed to eonstant
pressure by reason of unfavorable
trade conditions, yielding 1 to 24
points, and motors were under the
shadow of dividend "readjustments."
On the constructive side for a time
were rails, which evinced a fair de
gree of strength; industrials, includ
ing United States Steel and former
war equipments, also oils and tobac
cos, but the variable advance In these
groups were forfeited almost alto
gether at the end. Sales amounted
to 560.000 shares.
Dealings in bonds were moderate,
but more diversified, the tone in the
main being slightly easier. Liberty
issues were steady and internationals
irregular. Total sales, par value, ag
gregated $9,675,000. Old United States
bonds were . unchanged on call.
GRAIN MARKET.
CHICAGO, Nov. 21. Fresh indica
tions that immense supplies of food
stuffs from tho United States would
soon reach Europe made the corn
market today average higher despite
sharp differences of opinion as to the
magnitude and continuance of the ex
port movement. Prices closed firm,
1,4 ,to lc net higher, with December
1.29 to 129 and January 1.32 to
1 3?v. nnts cained '4c to c. The
outcome , in provisions varied from
unchanged figures to 45c lower.
New statements from the food ad
ministration referring to the needs of
starving millions iu transatlantic
countries gave corn an upward swing
at the outset, but the effect was soon
more than counterbalanced by word
that grain prices in Paris had fallen
about 50 per cent. The Paris report
was construed by the bears to mean
that supplies In France were more
plentiful than had been generally be
lieved here. This view, however, was
later eclipsed by advices that recent
United States government purchases
of flour totalled three million barrel,
that rationing of food in Great Britain
would not cease for many months and
that five large Dutch steamships had
already left American ports with
cargoes to remedy part of the food
shortage in the Netherlands.
Oats merely reflected the action of
corn. ,
Weakness in the hog market cased
provisions.

IMPORTANT TO ALL WOMEN
READERS OF THIS PAPER
Thousands upon thousands of wom
en have kidney or bladder trouble and
never suspect it.
Women's complaints often prove to
be nothing else but kidney trouble, or
the result of kidney or bladder dis
ease. If the kidneys are not in a healthy
condition, they may cause tho oth
er organs to become diseased.
You may suffer pain in the back,
headache and loss of ambition.
Poor health makes you nervous, ir
ritable and may be despondent; it
makes any one so.
But hundreds of women claim that
Dr. Kilmers Swainp-Roof, by restor
ing health to the kidneys, proved to
be just the remedy needed to over
come such conditions.
A good kidney medicine, possess
ing real healing and curative value,
should be a blessing to thousands of
nervous, over-worked women.
Many send for a sample bottle to
see what Swamp-Root, the great kid
ney, liver and bladder medicine will
do for them. By enclosing ten cents
to Dr. Kilmer & Co., Binghamtou, N.
Y., you may receive sample size bot
tle by parcel post. You can purchase
