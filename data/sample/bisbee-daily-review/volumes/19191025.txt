Appeal From President Wil

Secretary Wilson Admits
Failure and Confer
ence Adjourns
Each Side Charges
Other Was at Fault
Miners Agree to One Propo
sal Made by President; Op
erators Accept All Three;
Lewis Prepares to Call
Men Out
WASHINGTON. Oct. 24. The last
government effort to avert the coal
strike, set for November 1, failed ut
terly tonight, and 500,000 miners will
quit work on the very eve of winter,
with the nation's bins running dan
gerously low.
Even an appeal from President Wil
son was not enough, to bring peace to
a conference that was torn and on the
breaking point half a dozen times dur
ing the day. Charges and counter
charges flew thick and fast as the
groups of operators and miners filed
out of the meeting, which began some
what hopefully four days ago.
Whlle-the operators announced that
they had accepted the president's of
fer to wipe the slate clean and ne
gotiate a new wage agreement, the
miners charged that the operators had
bolted without the consent of Secre
tary of Labor Wilson, the storm center
of an extraordinary fight to save the
country untold distress and suffering.
Surrounded by a score of miners,
John L. Lewis, president of the United
Mine Workers of America, hurried out
of the hall and halted long enough to
announce that the strike order stood,
and that the miners would walk out
alter a full day's work on the closing
day of the present month. The final
breaking up of the conference, Lewis
said, meant that the official notice of
the failure would be sent forth with
the word to unions everywhere to
order the. men out of the mines at the
appointed hour.
The president's appeal was made
through Secretary Wilson, after the
Itater had exhausted every possible
effort and had pleaded until his throat
ached. It pointed out what a strike
meant and urged the sides to get to
gether, negotiate their differences, re
sorting to arbitration only in the event
that negotiations failed. The import
ant point in the proposal, however,
was that the mines be kept open and
the miners stay at work.
The miners and operators had left
the conference room and Secretary
Wilson, the tears springing to his
eyes, was gathering up his papers,
when he announced that his efforts
and the president's efforts had failed,
and that the conference had adjourned
for good.
He explained the status, but re
fused to be drawn into charges of bad
faith.
"The operators agreed to accept the
proposal in its entirety," Mr. Wilson
said, "and to proceed with negotia
tions if they failed to come to a con
clusion, to submit the matters still in
dispute to arbitration, the mines to
continue In operation pending arbitra
tion." .
"The miners were willing to accept
the proposal to proceed to negotiate.

PUBLIC GROUP
Refused to Carry On Work
Alone and Recommend
Wilson Create Commission
to Settle Industrial Disputes
WASHINGTON, Oct. 24. With a
recommendation to President Wilson
that he create a commission to car
ry on the work which the national
industrial conference was unable to
accomplish, the public group, the
last remaining element of the body,
finally adjourned tonight.
Despite two attempts by Mr. Wil
son to save from dissolution the
gathering, tonight's adjournment
brought to a formal close the con
ference, called by the executive to
find some common ground of co
operation between labor and capital.
on the outcome of which weer held
in abeyance strikes affecting the en
tire industrial life of the nation.
The report of the public represent
atives, declining to assume the task
for which the original gatherig was
called was transmitted to the White
House yirough Chairman Earuch in
the form of a thousand word letter.
No letter was forthcoming from the
White House as to the president's
next move to bring industrial peace
to the country.
Although the report was not made
public, it was learned that the docu
ment summarized the proceedings of
the 14 days the conference was in
session, put the stamp of approval
on the plan for industrial boards sug
gested by Secretary of Labor Wilson,
and recommended the calling of an
other body containing Industrial ex
perts to undertake the peace adjust
ment. It was drafted by a commit
tee of five delegates, of which John
D. Rockefeller, Jr., was chairman.
Although four or five conferees were
opposed to final adjournment, only
Dr. Charles W. Eliot, . president
emeritus of Harvard university,
voted against the motion on final
test. .
Delegates urged that the high cost
of living - and other problems be
pressed for Immediate solution be
fore dissolution, but a strong ma
jority of the representatives, it was
said, felt that the conference virtu
ally came to an end with the with
drawal of the labor group Wednes
day and that the public group was
not sufficiently representative to un
dertake a general program and also
was handicapped by popular disfa
vor. , ' , ' '
The industrial board plan of Secre
tary Wilson, which met with favor
among the delegates, provides for
boards of employers and employes in
each industry, with a general board
of appeals, and, as a final resort in
cases of dispute, an umpire chosen
by the parties to the dispute or from
a standing list of twenty named by
the president.
Everything In the shipment Is to
be sold at cost, and if those in
charge of the sale find that their
work is proving a success, the
shipments will be continued. All
the goods come direct from the
Gila valley, and are guaranteed
to be as fine in condition as they
will be reasonable in price.

WASHINGTON, Oct, 24. What
may prove one of the greatest indus

by some observers here to be fore
casted iy the announcement today
by Samuel Gompers, president of the
American Federation of Labor, that
a conference of the heads of the 112
international unions affiliated with
the American Federation of Labor
would be held in Washington in the
"near future" to discuss present and
impending disputes.
Co-operation of the four big rail
road brotherhoods and the farmers
of the country as well as the labor
organizations of Canada probably

thering whatever program the union
chiefs decide upon.
Mr. Gompers' announcement was
contained in a telegram to the Illi
nois Federation of Labor at Peoria.
His message was in reply to one in
which the Illinois organization asked
that a special convention, of the
American Federation of Labor be
called to perfect an alliance of the
international unions of the United
States and Canada and the railroad
brotherhoods "more effectively to
fight out the life and death struggle
of the workers now in progress." .
Federal officials also pointed out
that the Illinois' branch , proposed
that the aid of .the farraers.be enlist

Palmer Urges End
of High Wages and
Profiteering prices
BOSTON, Oct. 24. A Mitchell Pal
mer, attorney general of the United
States, demanded the ending of the
"Vicious circle of higher wages and
higher prices" In an address before
a cost of living conference at the
state house today.
He urged increased production,
declaring that "idleness is a sin In
this emergency," and said that the
department of Justice was making
every effort to punish profiteering.
He asserted that 99 men out of 100
in both retail and wholesale busi
ness were "taking only a fair profit"
and said that it j was the depart
ment's policy to ask honest business
men to enforce the laws against
profiteering.
Mr. Palmer declared this policy
was to be worked out through ' fair
price committees in every city and
county of the country.
"The people." Mr. Palmer said,
"find themselves chasing about in a
circle high prices, higher wages
and higher wages chasing higher
prices for everything. The people
will get nowhere by continuing that
process indefinitely except to a point
where industrial' disaster will over
take the United States."

JH
JON, Oct. 24. After an
Sdebate on the Johnson
. w ..to the peace treaty, sen
ate leaders said tonight that, although
they would try to bring the proposal
to a vote tomorrow, they were by no
rveans certain the plan would succeed.
They set the time of meeting an hour
earlier than usual, in the hope that the
'senate might talk itself out before
night.
During most of today's session, the
debate dragged along without much
show of interest, but just before ad
journment the undercurrent of bitter
feelins cropped out in a sharp ex
change between Senator ojhnson, Re
publican of California, author of the
amendment, and Senator JIale, Re
publican of Maine, opposing it.
Declaring that the amendment,
which proposese in effect that in any
Tltcision by the league of nations the
United States shall have as many
Votes as Great rBitain and her colo
nies, would not in actual operation in
sure equality in the league, Senator
Hale had argued that better results
could be accomplished by a reserva
tion on the subject. He alluded to
Senator Johnson's plea yesterday that
hi3 amendment represented the view
point of Americanism, and continued:
"Let me say to the senator from
California that the motives of those
opposing his proposal are every bit as
"high as his motives. I am just as
much opposed as he is to inequality
in the league, but I believe In meeting
it with a reservation which will rem-
fedy it, rather than with an amendment
which will not."
Senator Johnson replied that the op
position seemed to him to be based on
an unwillingness to go even as far as
his amendment would go, rather than
on a fear that it did not go far
enough. He repeated that he consid
ered it an embodiment of American
asm and added that before the sub
ject was closed senators would have
an opportunity of showing where they
stood on another amendment which
would go far enough to suit anybody.
! am glad," retorted Senator Hale,
"to see the senator set up as a test of
Americanism his own amendment, but
I cannot, accept that, test for myself.
If he has any question of my patriot
ism, he is welcome to it,"

WASHINGTON, Oct. 24. Follow
ers of Lenine and Trotzky in the

military control as a result of vio
lence during the steel strike, grew
so bold this summer that they at
tempted organization of a "red
guard" with discharged soldiers as
the armed force, Lt. Donald C. Van
Buren, a military intelligence officer,
told the senate labor committee to
day in resumption of its inquiry into
the walkout of steel workers.
Lieutenant Van Buren, who is on
the staff of Major General Leonard
Wood, in command of the troops in
Gary, laid before the committee
scores of pamphlets, circulars and
propaganda tracts, along with rec
ords of the statements of men ar
rested after the beginning of the
military occupation, to back his as
sertion that agitators in the steel
city "were urging the workers to get
ready, to get prepared to take over
the industries and the government
and run it themselves."
Oscar E. Anderson, chairman ci
the steel workers' council at Gary,
put in a staunch challenge of most
of Van Buren's conclusions.
"There aren't more than 250 or 300
'reds" in the 75,000 people at Gary."
Anderson declared. "They don't
count; we don't pay any attention to
them. In the labor movement they
are regarded as loose upstarts."
"You consider this is a strike for
eight hours and a living American
wage?" Chairman Kenyon began.
"Don't you think you would get fur
ther before the public if you got rid
of these red, purged your organiza
tions completely of them, and went
ahead without them?"
"Yes, Mr. Anderson," Senator Mc
Keller of Tennessee interjected.
"Why don't you pitch them out? This
committee has sat here and listened
to anarchists who have been taken
into council on your strike matters
and heard them boast of it. We have
followed Mr. Foster's history, past
and present, and men like that, clear
up at the top of your organizations.
Don't you know this prejudices the
public wholly against you atd your
cause?"
"Yes, I do," Anderson responded.
"But you can't tell how these men
are affected until a strike actually
comes along. We don't make reli
gious and political distinctions in
calling a strike."
The whole issue in the striki;, he
said, was the eight hour day.

THE BISBEE DAILY REVIEW
SATURDAY, OCTOBER 25, 1919
LDUOHHEY ID GEUHRS STAGE ,
PREMIER FISTIC EXHIBITION
Standing toe to toe, covered wlthj In the semi-final, Johnnie Meyer,
blood, with heads down and bolhj Bisbee's favorite and perhaps the
hands swinging to jaw and body, orj best liked fighter in the district, put
else surging from oue side of the Kid Muscovie, of El Paso, away in
ring to the other, neither getting out the third with a man-sized smash to
of the way or refusing to take pun- the kidneys that nearly jarred the
ishment, Frank Loughery "of Bisbee j theater. Meyer was as cool and col
and Johnnie Celmars staged the lected as he has always bken .and
hardest and most grueling fight last
night that was ever, presented in the
Warren district. From the time that
the first gong sounded and the fight
ers stepped from their corners, until,
bleeding and too exhausted to shake
hands at the end of the last round,
they were taken horn the ring, both
men put up such a battle as it has
seldom been the luck of fight fans
to see in any part of the west. The
general verdict of the fans was that
it was undoubtedly Arizona's great
est ring encounter.
Loughery, forsaking his usual style
of milling, stepped out from the first
gong, carrying the fight to Celmars,
and forcing him every second. So
strongly did he carry the fight for
the first two rounds that he looked
like an easy winner. His blows car
ried weight, and Celmars slowed be
fore the beginning of the third.
The fight before the third had been
hard, but this round opened up the
real battle. Celmars was swinging
wickedly when they met, and Lough
ery was boring in. After a minute's
fighting they both were; slightly
tired, but stood toe to toe along the
rope3 and slugged back and forth j
wh:lc the crowd went wild. This
round alone , was worth the price of
admission.
Teh fourth opened up with Celmars
rested and swinging hard as he
lushed Loughery In the latter's cor
ner. ' Loughery still dug in, landing
freequently to body and head, while
Celmars often caught him with sharp
lunges to the Jaw. ' ' ' - : '
The next four rounds were a toss
up, with Celmars and Loughery both
visibly tired. Celmars swung clean
ly, however, whenever Loughery
opened up, while the latter dug in,
seemingly looking for punishment
while he jabbed to head and midsec
tion, carrying the' fight whenever
there was an opportunity. Celmar's
chin had been opened up early in the
fight .and along towards the end of
the eighth, and both men covered
with blood as they doggedly . swung,
blocked, ducked and swung again, or
as, with heads together, they sought
to slip over, -the lucky one. ? '
In the nintth Celmars rushed
Loughery as the befl sounded, forc
ing the latter against the ropes with
both hands working. Celmars was
swinging wickedly, with Loughery on
the defensive, trying to get away
fro mthe ropes. Teh Celmars rush
forced the Bisbee fighter over the
ropes, and he swung rights and lefts
to Loughery's jaw while it seemed
that the fight was over. Then Lough
ery, fighting to his feet, put his head
down and tore at, his opponent, teeth
gritted and head down, . forcing Cel
mars to the center of the ring.
Standing at arms' lengtth both fight
ters swung time after time, both
landing heavily, while neither gave
an inch. Again the crowd jumped to
its feet, while a torrent of advice,
counsel and warning was let loose.
The final round was three minutes
of slugging. Shoulder to shoulder
the two fighters, for fighters . they
both are without the shadow of a
doubt, they kept their fists working,
bolh trying, trying, trying until the
gong closed the best fight a ,man
could wish to see.
The decision was made by two
judges, V. B. Winfry and James Nlc
oils, who also made the decision lu
the other fights of the evening. No
discussion could" possibly be mad
concerning the draw "which was
awarded, and the fans, with the ex
ception of extreme partisans for one
or the other of the fighters, accept
ed the verdict as the only one which
could have been rendered.
And, as if. Bisbee were to ge more
than its share of good things after
a fight like last right's, O. S." French,
who staged the card, and Bob Swec
ney, Celmar's manager, both an
nounced after the fight that they
were willing to make another match
With Loughery. The latrer's lip.

that it hung down on his chin, and
it is not probable that he will le

Is November 7, and the match will

Sweeney has also announced- his wil
lingness to match Celmars with Itus'
cell Chambers, of Douglas, who chal
lenged the winner last night,, and: It
Is possible that this match will be
presented on Nor. 7. , In, any event,.

was in good condition, as was also
Muscovie, and the whole house gave
him a hand when the El Paso scrap

Al Mauch, who met Fob Collins in
the second preliminary, gave away
about 30 pounds, and paid for it by
being knocked out for more than five
minutes in " the second round. Col
lins was in good shape, as also was
Mauch, but the former had the
weight and the reach, and the towel
should have been tossed in the first
round, when Mauch went down twice.
Kid Harunan- and Kid Hansen

To Arbitrate Strike

pressed a willingness to accept the
president's proposal in its entirety,
they held themselves ready to proceed
to negotiate and arbitrate whenever
"called upon by the secretary of labor
or by the miners' scale committee, and
with that statement withdrew.
"The miners remained -and express
ed their regret that the negotiations
could not go on, but cecf'nea to pro
ceed with the negotiations until it
had been determined whether the re
sults of the negotiations would be
successful or unsuccessful.
"The conference then adjourned
without date."
That was all the secretary would
pay, except to explain briefly how the
miners position worked out.
' The president's proposal," he de
clared, "was, first, to negotiate; sec
ond, to submit tile matter to arbitra
tion If negotiations failed. .and third,
to keep the mines in operation.
"The first the; miners accept, and
held over the other two for considera

"What is your next step?' Mr. Wil
son was asked. . .""
"Down to the automobile," he re
plied, as lie saw the last of his hard

There was . little . hope of settling
the strike when the miners and. opera
tors met late today, after two offers
by the secretary had been rejected.
In opening the meeting, Mr. Wilson
said he had just come from the White
House with a message,"from the presi
dent urging peace, that the people
might have a bountiful stock of coal.
Miners and operators, sitting in sef
p.rete groups, listened closely while
the secretary'read the letter from the

for settling the strike.

INTEREST IN
UNION PLANS
With the Central Labor Union hall
crowded to its capacity, the second
meeting of those interested in the
proposed organization of a local
branch bf the Pacific Cooperation
league was held last night and future
plans discussed. It was decided to
retain the temporary officers elected
at the first meeting until the mini
mum fund of $15,000 is raised. When
this total is reached a permanent
body of officers will be elected.
Great Interest is being displayed
in the proposed co-operative . store.
When it was announced that shares
would be 'sold at $5 each, several of
those present who were not in a po
sition to become a member of the
league of the shares sold at a great
er, figure, evinced a desire to join
immediately. . At the next meeting
it will be decided what limit will be
placed upon the amount of shares
each person may hold.'
While the national organization is
yet young, officers are each year ex
tending operations '.and it is not un
likely -that, some day li. will reach
the propensity of t the . parent asso

league in that country now owns its
own' tea plantations, steamers, mil

and extensive timber lands in Can

co-operative store in Tucson is con

Dear Vera:
I suppose you'll get married Borne,
time. 1 hope you will and I hope
you get a fine young man with
enough money to support you com
fortably. But, my dear daughter, I haven't
any of the old time ideas about the
home being the only ' place for a
woman. No one could expect me to t
have ..that 7 attitude toward life., and
marriage when I have made a suc
cess by my own activities outside
my home.
I think it would be "splendid if your
future husband had plenty of' money,
so much money that you never need
to worry or think about money mat
ters. But you may fall in love with
a man who is simply making his way
in the world and who can't afford
to support you in luxury.
In the event of such a thing hap
pening I don't want your young ro
mance spoiled by any old-time con
ventions which say that a, woman
must be utterly dependent on the
man. I want you to be able to do
your share toward keeping up the
home.
Furthermore, I want you to be able
to face the future unafraid. I want
you to have no terrors over the pos
sible loss of your husband's money
or his death leaving you alone and
helpless In the world. Therefore, my
dear, I advise you to begin right now
to train yourself In some line of ac
tivity in which you can support your
self in case of necessity.

you have a deep, abiding love for the

decide to take up so that you can

"BORING FROM WITHIN"
JACOB MARGOLIS of Pittsburgh, attorney for the I. W. W. and
a "syndicalist anarchist," through his testimony before, the
senate committee investigating the steel strike, has thrown
some very interesting light on the labor situation in the entire
country and which finds particular application in Arizona labor cir
cles. "Foster (the secretary of the steel strikers' general
committee) believed that he could still retain his integrity
as a syndicalist while going into the American Federation
of Labor and being a 'borer within as he put it; I did not
think he could," was the statement of Margolis before the
committee when questioned as to Foster's beliefs and con
nections. And Senator Kenyon cleared up the matter by
asking: .
' His idea was to retain his views, was it not and get
leadership in the American Federation of Labor, with which
to favor them?"
"Something like that," was the answer of Margolis. .
Boring from within is a new term, as applied to -union labor,
but it promises to be a synonym for the disruption of organized
labor, by those people, bent on revolution, who never have been
able to attain their end from without. Arizona's labor ranks have
two very prominent "borers from within," whose scalps are neces
sary if labor in this state shall cdntinue to enjoy any degree of
esteem from the people of the commonwealth.
Thomas Croaff, president or the State Federation of Labor,
and George D. Smith, its secretary, fit the term ; "borers from
within' They are exactly the shoes of Wm. Z. Foster. They have
maintained their "integrity as syndicalists" and have used the Ari
zona Federation of Labor for the furtherance of ideas and actions
that can result only in the complete disruption of the Federation
of Labor.
Both men have openly espoused the idea of the "one big
union." A glance at the Arizona Labor Journal, which they domi
nate, will convince the most skeptical of the truth of this state
ment. Smith is a proven member of the I. W. W. and Croaff has
' declared his lack of sympathy, on a numbor of occasions, for the
A. F. of L.
Arizona labor can not afford to harbor "borers from within."
They are bent on destruction and their insidious methods can only
result in the breaking up of the trades union movement. That is
their object; with ultimate hope for revolution and gradual (or
sudden) adoption of soviet government in the United States.
The Arizona Federation of Labor meets very soon in its annual
convention. The state is .quiet, industrially. Let labor, by the
elimination of "borers from within" do its share to keep ' this 'con
dition permanent. Tucson Star.
MUST LOOK AHEAD
IT is hard to keep cheerful and be an optimist in the face of de
pressing conditions. That is largely what copper producers have
had to do since the armistice was signed.
The fact remains, however, that when the peace negotiations t
are finally closed and our system of credits and trade relations are
again fully established, copper cannot help but be in great demand.
Our own country, which was not touched by the ravages of war,
but which simply slowed up on building operations for a short time,
cannot now catch up with requirements in building and expansion
demands.
Think what must be rhe requirements of nations which went
through five years of destructive warfare. They must buy eventu
ally when peace is established.
Our own needs in modern building, development or electrical
appliances, gas engines, airplanes, tractors, automobiles, etc., will
require the use of more copper, zinc and lead than ever before.
Labor troubles are delaying every line of activity and have been
for months, with consequent demoralization of all lines of production
in basic industries.
Such conditions might well cause even the strongest to hesitate
if they did not look beyond present conditions. In spite of all this,
however, consumption has gone on at a record rate in this country.
An authority on the copper situation says: "Europe must buy large
ly the quantity is only limited by the amount of cash and credit
that can be assembled.
"Japan and China can be counted on as large buyers so soon
as the pending political problems are worked out. The world needs
copper in vast quantities and must come to 'this country for it;
the need is urgent and imperative to restoration of normal indus
trial conditions. v
THE FUTURE OF OIL
A NATIONALLY prominent oil man says: "The fear of a possible
over-expansion of the oil Industry is not well based. Last
year the United States produced 341.000,000 barrels' of oil,
but this was 42,000,000 barrels j short of consumption, whicn
had to bo imported from Mexico.
"Eliminating the war increase and taking the ten years preced
ing the war, we find that the average annual increase in consump
tion, if continued, will in eight years require every oil refinery in
the United States to double its capacity.
"The ten-year pre-war increase occurred before the airplanes
and the submarine began using large quantities; before conversions'
from coal to oil as fuel for ships became frequent, and while the
automobile industry was just getting into its stride. In ensuing
years the demand from these sources for oil will increase tremen
dously. The possibilities in use of oil as vessel fuel alone can be
appreciated from the fact that three 5000 ton cargo boats burning
oil can do the work of four same size vessels using coal, and at less
expense per boat."
Is it any wonder that far-seeing men are striving fro a national
policy and legislation encouraging to, rather than discouraging to
further development of our oil lands?
TAX EXEMPTION AND SPECIAL TAXES I
TAXATION and tax exemptions can make or break different lines
of industry. Every, expert and economist who hus expressed
himself! on tax exemption has condemned it. The special 5
per cent: excise tax on candy above all other taxes.-illustrates
a special tax 'on 'the industry and the exemptioq of others'.
Tax exemption and special taxes have no defenders on any
pleas but opportunism or special interest. It is a disease which
began in a small way, but now needs the surgeon's knife to re
move it-and re-establish a uniform tax system.
Tax exemptions and special taxes threaten to make financing
of private business impossible if coutinutd ill the present rate.

Late last July a woman who had
been married before was granted a
divorce from her second husband, with
permission to resume the name of her
first husband. '' '
Less tnan 60 days afterward, de
spite a state law which declares that
no person divorced shall remarry wjin
, in less than a year, this woman mar
iried a third time, using, her maiden"
name.
Asked by the deputy clerk who is-
: sued the license II she had ever been
divorced, she said no, and as she gave
her maiden name, instead, of her legal
name, the name of her first husband,
it was impossible for the clerk to de
lect the deception.
Yesterday, by Ehejap-,accident, one of
the clerks who was acquainted with
the woman's history, ran into -the doc
uments in the files, and her illegal
action was brought to light.
, Severe measures will be taken, th

MESA. Oct. 24. The rollers were at
work this morning preparing the first
stretch of the Mesa end of the Mesa
Tempe highway for concrete. Steel
side rails have been laid for this
stretch of several hundred fet. and
the first of the concrete will be down
witnin tne next few days.

1a few weeks will be necessary foi

Tided, of course, that delays in ma

times in the future. i
Work in Tempe is progressing rap

cally prepared for the .starting of
paving. Considerable more time will
be required for the laying of this

PEPY'S DIARY IN BISBEE
Oct. 25. Up betimes, finding the morning chilly, and glad to find hot
coffee on the table. After hasty shave and breakfast, to the town, where I
went to the Y. W. C. A. with the telegraph editor, and there listened to a
merry conversation about gettig him a sweetheart. But when he told the
young lady just what the qualities of the proposed lucky one should be, 1
could not but marvel that he did not take the young woman he was talking
to, who is exceeding fair and witty withal, and whom he 'should not have
overlooked. To the store again, where I talke dto a brunette with flashing
eyes that held me so long that I was glad that my wife was not walking
around the street-this day. Saw Allie Howe, who told me about a wedding,
and r wrote a story, but now I hear the young woman in the case is not con
templating matrimony at all, which made it interesting for me, although
not as much so as it would have been for her if the report bad been correct.
Did also get some Information about the cashier's wedding ring, but not so
authentic that I could publish it, but she seemed quite romantic today, so
there must be something in the wind. To Miss Gregovich at the Y. W. C.' A.,
who writes for the paper every week, and glad to find that she does not
use so many capital letters. She is also accommodating, and has a winsome
smile, which helps her, I think, jn getting the editor to be so accommodating
to her. But small luck for me, due, I think, to my bald head and my Adam's
apple, which is beginning to be prominent, so that I must use judgment in
shaving around .it, and not to swallow while the blade is near. To the
office, where I quarreled a little with the telegraph editor about grammar,
but no harm done. So, after much writing, to bed, much pleased with some
sleeve protectors that my wife has made for me, but fearful that she will
ask for a new hat in the future..

Never to harbor or to sight a shore, .

I marveled on that patient, peaceful Power;

Oh, friend of mine! how oft our tongues are twirled
To spin vain words on every aimless matter!
A silent greatness often moves the world,

Hints For Planning Meals
FOOD FOR THE THIN MAN;
FOOD FOR-THE FAT MAN
Thin men usually, have more mus
cle in proportion to weight than fat
men and they also have more Bur
face exposed, both of which facts
increase their need for food or fuel.
A store of body fat is desirable as
reserve fuel ' for emergencies. This
reserve can only be gaineu by tak
ing food in excess of daily needs and
taking it purposely.
Sinc9 food is the only source of
body nourishment, persistent over
feeding is the only way to gain in
weight. A conscious effort must be
made, however, to take more fuel.
Simple foods which do not upset the
digestion are best. Liberal use ot
butter, cream and bacon and ',the
taking of one to two tablespoons of
olive oil after each meal are practical
vways of increasing fuel value of the
diet.
(Remember that butter, cream and
bacon are high at present. At . the
Bame time it will be far cheaper to
invest one's money in this way than
to pay the doctor later on because
of poor feeding due to the H. C. L
now.)
Just as we store money in the bank
for a rainy day so should the very
thin man store up body fat for fur
ther emergencies, as against disease,
etc.
Vegetables with cream sauces, sal
ads with mayonnaise may be served,
while milk, chocolate and cocoa can
be served as beverages. Eggs, in the
form of custards or egg noggs (milk
added to the beaten egg and sugar),
omelets, souffles add to the fuel
value of the diet. Meat should be
used moderately. , ;
The following is a day s dietary
suggested for a thin man of seden
tary occupation. You will note that
the ordinary requirement is 2400 ca
lories but that 3450 calories are
given.
(I would suggest that a thin man
take on fat in the early 'fall, espe
cially if living in Arizona.)

The most Wholesome and the most nourishing of all foods, is today
the only economical food.
BREAD has not increased in price like other foods. Your loaf to
day costs only a few cents more than before the war an advance
that represents the increased cost of labor more than anything else.
So BREAD, the Staff of Life, is within the reach of everybody.
Eat BREAD MORE BREAD instead of the richer, higher priced
foods, and you will cut down the high cost of living, and be health
ier and happier. .

grow older, they neglect to take as

Foods, very high in energy value,

fat should be avoided. Clear soups

STOCKS AND BONDS
NEW YORK, Oct. 24. The most re
assuring feature of today's Jess active
but far more orderly stock market
was the greater ease of money and
the steady accumulation at substantial
advances of high and low grade rail
road shares.'
CalLmoney opened at 5 per cent, the
lowest initial rate in several weeks,
and the more noteworthy, as all loans
hold over till next Monday. Time
money was in better supply, a few
loans being reported at slightly under
7 per cent.
Outstanding features of the railroad
'list included Reading. Southern Pa
cific, Atlantic Coast Line and Louis
ville & Nashville at gains of 3 to 5
joints. Among secondary shares
Texas & Pacific, St Paul, B. & O.,
Missouri Pacific, Western Pacific and
Katy were prominent, scoring extreme
j gains of 1 to 2 points.
. Oils, motors and their specialties,
steels and equipments, were hesitant
in the first half of the session, but
improved visibly later. They were
joined by food and tobacco issues at
material gains; coppers being the
oihly backward issues at the strong
close. Sales, 1,550,000 shares.
The tnd market was again irregu

GENERAL CONDITIONS
NEW YORK, Oct. 24. Bradstreefs
tomorrow will say: Two apparently
diverse views of the trade and indus
trial situation present themselves ac
cording as the immedaite situation or
the more distant future is regarded.
Current buying is active, never more
so indeed in many lines, and the only
complaint is ' inadequacy of materials
or of finished products to supply de
mand. Buying of wearing apparel,
much of it of a high grade, is excel
lent, and luxuries, jewelry, automo
biles and kindred articles apparently
uever sold better. If any hesitation is
visible it is in some lines of goods in
which price weakness Is predicted.
Prices as a whole are steady and of
ficial and other price comparisons,
while reflecting a fair lowering of food
price levels at wholesale since Au
gust 1, Tolnt to only a slight net re
duction in the entire list, with a re
tail price slow to follow wholesale
quotations downward. .
Manufacturing, though crippled by
strikes or labor Inefficiency, ranges
from fair to active, with a majority of
reports indicating efforts being made
to fill piled-up orders. The above re
fers to what might be termed present
demand.
Weekly bank clearings, $9,431,625,-000.

STOCK LETTER
The rails had a tendency to Impart
a certain degree of firmness to " the
list today In general. During the
course of the session a few rallies
took place in the standard share list,
but It was clearly evident that the
upturm were taken advantage of to
release long holdings, especially fn
the industrials. Events with resutct
to the railroads seem to be shaping
up in a more favorable way, and
there are not a few" of the conserva
tive element who are taking advant
age of every favorable opportunity to
accumulate rails.
L. J. OVERLOOK
CORN MARKET
CHICAGO, Oct. 24. Forecasts of
rought weather, together with, reports
of 'sub.zero temperatures over the
Canadian northwest did a good deal
today to put bears at a disadvantage
in the corn market. Closing prices,
although unsettled, were c to lc
net higher, with December $1.26 to
f 1.2614, and May $1.23 to $1.23.
Oats finished c to c up and pro,
visions varying from 32c decline to
40c advance. ,
There was persistent buying of corn
throughout the session, whereas offer
ings were" at no time large. Beside
unfavorable weather prospects, the
motives for buying included current
estimates that pointed to a shortage
of potatoes, meats and dairy products.
Much notice was taken of rresn
strength in the hog market and of the
fact that the visible supply of corn has
seldom been so small as at present.
Oats were dull but firm, in sym
pathy with corn.
( Provisions averaged lower, despite
higher quotations on hogs. .Packers
were said to be selling and there was

Hints For Planning
Meals
(Continued From Page Five)
foods should be taken in small quan
tities and can often be omitted. Fresh
fruus should take the place of pud
dings, cakes and pies.
Lean meats simply cooked may be
used liberally if plenty of trreen veg
etables be also included in the diet.
The habit that man fleshy people
have of - omitting breaKfast or lun
cheon Is not recommended for the
reason that one becomes so hungry
before the next meal ha eats more
than he would If he had eaten a
small amount at each meal, thereby
defeating his purpose. The follow-

The farmerette idea has invaded
ven the Holy Land, according to the
latest reports received in New
'York from Jerusalem by the Ameri
can Jewish Relief Committee.
American farmerettes heJped win
the war, and then many of them
folded up their overalls. These Judea
farmerettes, on the contrary, are go
ing in xor the tremendoosJy harder
task of reconstruction farming.
Their job is to transform the Holy
City into a jjarden spot from the
Tlace of desolating poverty that
war has left it and to help provide
additional food supplies for the
starving Jewish women and children
in the Holy Land
Sixty Jewish girls from fourteen
to twenty years old, almost all of
them orphaned, many of them vic
tims of the Turkish invasion, are en
gaged in this work at present, and
their number is increasing every day.
Their wages are paid by the Joint
Distnhntdrtn Cnm-miMa nf A m
Funds ; for Jewish War Sufferers,
""v.u u luauezntjz me iazmmor plan,
and one of whose constituent bodies,
the American Jewish Relief Comit
tee, is now engaged in a series of
state campaigns m this country to
raise its coming year's relief fund
of $35,000,000. Tools are loaned by
the American Red Cross, and seeds
are given by the same organization,
or sent from England, or purchased
locally by American Jewish Relief
agents.
Four stony, uncultivated wastes
have already been turned into flour
ishing market-gardens, by the Judea
farmerettes, known locally as the
Jerusalem Land Girls, whose occu
pation is all the styk m the Holy
City. Girls who turn up their noses
at the idea of doing domestic work
crowd around the gardens, begging
to be taken on as farmerettes.
Alleged Bootlegger

History of Number 40
40 years ago an old doctor was put
ting up a medicine for diseases of the
blood, that cured the worst cases of
specific blood poison and time proved
that the cures were permanent. After
many years I:secured he prescription
(being a druggistl, and took each in
gredient Separately and referred to
my U. S. Dispensartory and other
authoritative books on medicine and
found the medical properties set down
as follows: "Employed in diseases of
the glandular syste, in blood poison,
scrofula, eczema, chronic rheumatism,
catarrh, in sores, ulcers, pimplec, skin
eruptions, mercurial and lead poison
ing. Under its use nodes, tumors and
scrofulous swellings that have with
stood all other treatment disappear as
if by magic." To commemorate my
fortieth year, as a druggist I named
this medicine "Kumfter 40 For the
Klood." J. C. Hendenhall, Evansville,

I Just wanted to sleep all the time, for
that was the only ease I could get, when
i was asleep. I became a nervous wreck .
Just from the awful suffering with my :
head. . ..'.!
I was so nervous that the least noise
would make me Jump put of my bed. 1
had no energy, and was unable to do
anything. My son, a young boy, had to
do all my household duties. .
I was not able to do anything until I
took Cardui. I took three bottles in all
and it surely cured' me of those awful
headaches. : That has been three years
ego, and I know the cure is permanent,
(or I have never had any headache since
taking Cardui. . .
Nothing relieved me until 1 took Cardui.
It did wonders for me."
