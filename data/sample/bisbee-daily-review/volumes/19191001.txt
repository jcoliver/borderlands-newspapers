60 PERCENT
E
BUFFALO, N. Y., Sept. 30. With
the extreme views of both sides vot
ed down, the, Joint conference of
miners and operators of the central
competitive field tomorrow will be
gin again at zero to negotiate a
new wage scale and new working
conditions. .
Following the rejections by the
operators of the miners' original de
mands for a 60 per cent increase in
wages and a 30-hour working week,
the Joint conference today voted
down the operators' maximum which
was that the scale of 1916, called
the Washington agreement, be con
tinued until April 1, 1920.
The olive branch came from the
operators Bide, the motion to pro
ceed to negotiate a new contract "in
accordance with the call of the con
ference,' being offered by one of
their number. It was conceded that
the gap between miners and oper
ators was a wide one, but represen
tatives" of both sides expressed hope
that it tfould be bridged and that
the threatened Btrlke of 400,000 men
on November 1 would be averted.
The Washington agreement was
the only question before the con
ference today. John T. Lewis, act
ing president of the United States
Mine Workers, first offered a reso
lution that the agreement termin
ate at the end of next month. P.
H. Penna of Terra Haute, spoke for
the operators and moved as an
amendment that April 1, 1920, be
fixed as the date of expiration as
provided in the Washington agree
ment When it came to vote oper
ators ana miners supported their
respective delegates. The action to
proceed under the call of the con
ference was then unanimously adopt
ed and adjournment was taken un
til tomorrow.

Greater Production
To Settle Unrest
ST. LOUIS, Sept 30. Increased
production as a means of settling
the present Industrial unrest and
the declaration of an industrial truce
for six months as a method of re
ducing the cost of living, were sug
gested by W. G. Gardlng, governor
of the federal reserve bank, before
the convention of the American
Bankers , association today.
Causes of the labor trouble, Gov
ernor Harding asserted, are directly
traceable to the. war, to its waste
and destruction, 'to its heavy drain
upon ' available supplies that con
stituted so large a part of the
world's wealth and to financial ex
pedients, , which, he said, were nec
essary to obtain these supplies.

COUNCIL FOR

OF STRIKES
IS PLANNED
Labor and Industrial Confer
ence on Monday Expected
to Develop Organization to
Replace War Labor Board
WASHINGTON, Sept. 30. Propos
als for the establishment of a coun
cil for settlement of industrial dis
putes, replacing the recently dis
solved war labor board, probably will
be one of the firt subbjects brought
up for discussion at, the labor ana
industrial conference called by Pres
ident Wilson to meet here Monday,
it was learned today from depart
ment of labor officials in close touch
with the arrangements for the meet
ing. Secretary Wilson has drawn up
a tentative program' for the confer
ence, but the question of whether
the opening will be open to repre
sentatives of the press has not been
decided. It was said today by those
makin arrangements . for the meeting
that the question of publicity prob
ably would be left to decision of
the conference. A suggestion has
been made that newspaper men not
be admitted to the conference room,
but that such parts of the proceed
ings as the conferees decided to
make public be given to the press
as the conference proceeds. This
plan would be similar to the recent
White House conference between
President Wilson and the senate
foreign relations committee.
In the event that President Wil
son Is unable to open tne comer
ence as planned, it 13 not known
by officials here who the presiding
officer will be although it was like
ly that the president would desig-
naate some one to act for him. Sec
retary Wilson, it was said by sev
eral officials, may submit a proposal
for arbitration boards, so he is
(known to look with favor on a plan
providing for district boards of ar
bitration, the awards of which would
be put in force by the issue of an
Injunction by the federal court of
the district restraining employers
who are parties to the dispute In
question from paying wages other
than provided for in the award. J
Thi3 plan would preserve tie right
of the men to strike but proceed to
take away the Incentive to strike
as employers would be restrained by
a court decision from .paying wages
other than the sum fixed as Just
by the district boards.
Some means of removing causes
of disputes and of conferring a
larger degree of participation by la
bor in the management of industry
along the lines of the Whitley coun
cil in England probably will be dis
cussed, It was said. Whitley coun
cils, so-called, after the Scotch man
ufacturer and member of a British
ministry of reconstruction commit
tee who proposed them, have been
established in more than 50 Import
ant British industries.
There is a separate Joint standing
industrial council, as they are of
ficially named, for each Industry ac
cepting the plan. In addition to the
national council, district and local
boards are created to handle prob
lems arising within their Jurisdic
tion.' Both employers and workers
are represented on the boaroV which
deal with the general policy Of the
factory, the efficiency of the plant
and similar matters, as well as with
possible sources of friction between
capital and labor.

NO IMPORTANT CHANGE IN STRIKE
SITUATION:
PITTSBURGH, Sept. 30. The steel
workers strike, so far as the Pitts
burgh district is concerned, drif'ed
along today without any important
change being noticed. The entire
strike zone was quiet. ' The unions
claim they are holding their men to
gether and are constantly bringing
more Into their ranks. The 'compa
nies, however, say they are getting
more workers into the plants, due to
the desire of men to work and to
the good police protection afforded
them.
While both sides are working to
increase their respective forces there
is a belief in some quarters that no
break, if any, can be looked for until
after the industrial conference which
opens at Washington next Monday.
In the meantime the struggle will
go on here. There are more organ
izers in the Pittsburgh district now,
according to labor leaders, than at
any other time since the walkout
started nine days ago. Virtually
every one of the 24 unions involveu
has sent Its own organizers into the
field and claims are made that hun
dreds of men are being taken into the
organizations every day.
Situation Improves.
Steel companies that daily give out
information continue to maintain thar
the situation from their standpoint la
slowly but steadily improving. "We
are making steel and lots of it; we
have lost no ground but, on the con
trary, are still gaining, said a Car
negie company statement. Other
companies made similar announce
ments. At the national headquarters of the
strikers satisfaction was expresseu
by the leaders that they have the
strike well in hand and that they will
be able to keep the steel industry
of the country crippled until the em
ployers consent to meet the men half
way.
Figures were given out for the first
time in nearly a week. It was said
that approximately 375.000 workfrs
are now idle. This is an increase ot
piout. 32,000 over tbo rumher c.men
reported by the leaders as idle last
week. The walkout of steel workers

MERCHANTVILLE. N. J., Sept. 30.
James Whiting, the negro who is
alleged to have assaulted a white
woman of this place and for whom
a posse had been scouring the coun
tryside since yesterday afternoon,
was captured tonight along Ranco
cas creek, near Mount Holly. He
was locked up in the Mount Holly
Jail.
The negro was captured by a de
tective who rushed him to Jail ,ln
an automobile. Other members of
the posse were not informed that
the fugitive had been taken Into
custody until he had been locked up.
Although threats against the negro
were, made by some of the men,
most of them left their homes short

officials declared they did not ex

Parker said Whiting was so near
ly exhausted that he did not offer
any resistance to arrest. He was
unarmed.
Landing of Troops at Fiume Investigated
WASHINGTON, Sept. 30. Landing or American marines at Trau, Dal
matia, to dislodge Italian forces, which had occupied the town was discussed
in congress again today, with the senuate, after sharp debate adopting a res
olution by Senator New, Republican of Indiana, calling on President Wilson
for a report of the incident if not incompatible to the public interest Secre
tary Daniels said today no further report on the landing of the marines had
been received from Rear Admiral Andrews, commanding the American force
in the Adriatic. The officer has been asked to send additional details.
Mr. Daniels said the division of the Dalmation coast for patrol by
American, French and Italian naval forces had been decided upon by a
board of admirals representing the United States, Great Britain, France
and Italy and approved by the peace conference and that the plan was to re
main in force until final disposition of the Dalmatian territory by the peaci
conference.
The commanders of the patrolling naval forces, he added, were respon
sible for the preservation of order on that portion of the coast assigned
them and that Admiral Andrews had ample authority to take such steps a
he deemed necessary to prevent disorder!
During the senate debate on the New resolution, charges by Senator
Hitchcock of Nebraska, administration leader in the treaty fight, that
Republicans were using the Trau and otJier incidents in Europe to "heckle"
the president and were filibustering to delay the peace treaty brought sharp
denials from Republican Leader Lodge and Senator Fall, Republican, New
Mexico.

One of the developments of the day
that did not satisfy the strike leaders
was the decision of the Allegheny,

of the mayor Duquesne in preventing

committee and an organizer were ar
rested two weeks before the strike
statred while attempting to speaK
from an automobile in a vacant lot.
No permit to bold the meeting haa
been asked for, and it was admitted
by the city that none would have been
issued. Mr. Foster and the organ

county court today upheld the action
of the city authorities. The court

amounts to more than $20,000,000,
with 5000 people destitute, Clark
Pease, chairman of the finance relief
committee at Corpus Christi, has
sent an urgent call for help to Mayor
Jacob Erickson, who received It yes
terday. The letter follows:
"Corpus Christi and vicinity ' has
been overwhelmed by a disastrous
hurricane and tidal wave. The death
list, already more than 1000, Is grow
ing daily as the bay gives up its dead.
More than 6000 people are destitueJ
and the property loss exceeds $20,-'
000,000. I
"To care for the destitute, the,
homeless and suffering requires many
hundreds of thousands of dollars,
and the citizens of Texas and other
Bttaes have responded speedily ana
nobly to the first appeal for help seni
broadcast over the nation.
i."The state government has sent
troops to preserve order, and rations
and equipment to assist in clearing
the city of debris.
'"Seventy-five per cent of the busi
ness men of Corpus Christi are bank
rupt today. Some, of them have had
their places of business swept away,
together with their homes. Many of
them have Jost members o f their fami
lies, and all of them have suffered ir
reparable damage.
, "A committee of bankers and mer
chants, with Red Cross representa
' tion, formed to make a survey of
property loss, has reported the dam
age toexceed twenty millions, cover
ing devastated area of 40 miles along
the coast. It is not too high; it ma
be too low.
"All .contributions may be Bent to I
Governor W. P. Hobby, Mayor Gordou:
Boone of Corpus Christi, or to the un
dersigned, and will be allotted to the
stricken districts by national officers
of the Red Cross after said officers,
have made a complete survey of the'
devastated area.
"Corpus Christi intends to rebud
and start anew. It is not discouraged
and is not afraid, but looks to the fu
ture with the confidence charactei
istic of a brave people. One of the
oldest towns in Texas, it has never
before asked for aid, but has glve
often and freely.
"Today it is weighted down with
sorrow and disaster ;tomorrowTit"inll
rise again, but it must have financial
help now-. ' -
"Wii: you help us in this hour?
And be assured that it is needed and
will be appreciated."
Mayor Erickson has announced
that the matter of giving assistance
will be laid before the city council at
its meeting next Tuesday. In the
meantime, the question of giving
more immediate help has been pre;
sented to the Warren District Com
mercial club, which will take action
today, :
Those wishing to contribute for the'
relief of I the suf ferors are asked ' to
BPnd their donations either to Mayor
Erickson or - to the Red Cross. .
No Change in Steel
Strike Situation
(Continued From Page One) ,
testimony while the strike is in prog
ress. "I am anxious to go before the
committee," he said.
To Issue Bulletins.
In order to acquaint the strikem
with the progress of the strike in all
districts it was said a bulletin service
would be initiated. Several times
each week 93,000 bulletins will be
printed and sent throughout the
country, it was said.
Efforts of the union organizers In
this district are beirfg concentrated
on the Jones & Laughlin plant. Mr.
Foster asserted that four mills in the
plant were completely down because
of a walkout of Bkilled American
workers, including rollers and rough
ers. He said that virtually all the
American skilled workers were out.
The organizer in the Johnstown
district reported to headquarters that
a large number of . clerical employe i
in plants affected by the strike had
applied for membership. He was In
structed to organize the clerical worK
ers and obtain an American Federa
tion of Labor charter for them.
.'The v following telegram was re
ceived at . strike headquarters from
Mr. De Youngi Chicago district, to
night: "Reports on riots in Waukegan un
true. Absolutely peaceful. Picketing
all points.. Situation better than evei-.
Chicago district sends message that
all tied up and will stay out urmi
fight won."
NO CHANGES IN
No Definite Action
In Shipyard Strike
WASHINGTON, Sept. D.AU
though no definite statement was
forthcoming following an all day con
ference here today of executives of
15 international unions having mem
bers In the shipbuilding Industry, the
concensus of expressed opinion was.
that the workers would take no dras
tic action to enforce their demands
for repeal of the recent wage Increase
order until after the Industrial confer
ence called by President Wilson for
October 6.
The meeting today was preliminary
to a conference tomorrow - between
representatives of the shipyard em
ployes and Alsslstant Secretary of the
Navy Roosevelt, and Director General
Ackerson, , of the Emergency Fleet
corporation.
The wage Increase order to which
the workers object was promulgated
recently by the navy department and
the Bhipping board and provides spe
cifically that no wage Increases after
October 1, the date of the expiration
of the existing Macy award, shall be
permitted in navy yards or in yards
constructing tonnage for the government.
War Takes One Fifth
Serbian Population
Italians Ask Ships

BELGRADE, Sept. One-Iifth of
the population of Serbia, 6r about
800,000 persons, perished from all
causes during the war. Typhus alone
claimed about 300,000 of these. No
figures have yet been furnished by
the Serbian war department as to
the number of deaths in the army.
! It is known that the total number
of men mobilized wds 700,000. . Ot
this number 300,000 were .'combatant
troops and 400,000 were used in va
rious auxiliary services. About' 10,
000 Serbians were interned in Bul
garia during the war, and of these
about one-half are believed to have
perished, according to the report of
the inter-allied commission.
LONDON STRIKE
LONDON, Sept. 30. By the Associat
ed Press). The fourth day of the rail
way strike closes with the struggle un
changed. Neither side has made any
resumption of negotiations; both are
showing an equal determination not to
yield. There has been no extension of
the strike to other industries, but
James Henry Thomas, secretary of the
union, has announced his readiness to
accept help from other trades unions
and a manifesto was issued from the
transport federation tonight, which,
foreshadows the probable decision to
call a strike tomorrow on the ground
that the government action is an at
tack ou the principles of trade union
ism. Theree is evidence of unrest and
irritation among the electrical work
ers at the success of the amateurs
and volunteers working in the large
power stations in London, whereby
part of the underground electric rail
ways was enabled to Btaht operation
and there is some apprehension that
the electrical workers may be called
out.
The transport workers federation Is
sued an official statement to the ef
fect that reports show that 100,000
members of the federation are already
affected by the railroad strike and
that, therefore, the position is rapidly
becoming untanable.
ROME, Sept. 30. The Italians- at
Trau, Dalmatia, hfcve asked the Ital
ian government to send a ship to
Trau for their protection, and also
to obtain the release of prominent
Italians arrested by the Serbians. .The
government has replied that it can
not interfere for the maintenance ot
order in sections of Dalmatia entrust
ed to the care of the Americans, hu:
that it will convey the appeal to tim
Ameiican commander, Rear Admiral
Andrews.

WITH EVERY HOTEL FILLED WITK
ROOTERS, CINCINNATI AWAITS
WORLD'S GREATEST BALL Ell
?
CINCINNATI, Sept. 30. At 2
"-'.-Cock tomorrow afternoon one ot
"four umpires at Redland field will
t i his hand, the Cincinnati Reds
7l4 take their playing places, Liebold
or J. Collins, of the Chicago White
Sox will enter the batters' box and
the first of the great contests for
baseball's richest prize and v highest
honors will, begin.
Nothing but weather of the most
unfavorable kind will delay the start
and when play starts the greatest
throng that ever saw a ball game in
Cincinnati will be assembled. Every
seat at the park has been' sold for the
first two games rjd all reserved seats
for the first there games have -been
purchased.
. Cincinnati hotels groaned today un
der the weight of baseball enthusi
asm. They were the caldron in which
diamond discussion from the four
corners of the country seethed. .
. The majority of the guests who reg
istered iit the principal hotels were
prepared for inconveniences, and they
were actually surprised when they
found how thoroughly the manage
ments tad laid their planB. True, in
some instances 15 men will find it
necessary to sleep in one room, but
they will be in comfortable , single
beds. Some may have to sleep behind
screens in reception rooms and halls,
but their beds will be but a step from
a luxurious shower.
Senator "Warren G. Harding of Ohio
was one of the more fortunate and
has the entire bridal suite- at one of
the leading hotels. Barney Oldfield,
the noted automobile racer, and some
of his party, will occupy the bridal
suite at another hostelry,-while Presi
dents Herrman nand Comiskey both
have engaged suites where they can
receive their friends.
Even the extremely unfortunate
who can find no accommodation will
have police protection when they re
sort to the park benches, if such a
thing becomes necessary.
Tomorrow morning the final details
for the Beries will be arranged at the
national commission meeting. The
umpires will be assigned and the
managers of both teams and the um
pires will be acquainted with the
ground rules.
While no official announcement has
been made relative to ground rules, it
is believed the National league rules
will apply for the series. The field
is entirely free from obstruction in
right field, while more than three
qnarters of center field is free, and
a long hit to certain parts of these
can possibly result in a home run.
Betting on the series was notable
today for its absence. Several wagerb
of large amounts were ottered. No
takers were reported. Local fans are
demanding odds, while Chicago sup
porters are asking even money, anl
a deadlock appears to exist.
olrth teams worked out at Redlands
field toay, the Reds taking a turn in
the morning and1 then allowing tho
Sox to figure on the angles of the
field. In the afternoon the Sox were
allowed a full practice to figure on
the sun's rays at different times dur
ing the afternoon.
John Collins, ftie Chicago outfielder,
after finishing, his practice said: "I
am going over right now and make
a purchase. That's a pair of sun
glasses. They tell me your sun here
is the fiercest ever, and I believe
them."
As the train bearing the champions
of the American league came puffing
to a halt in Grand Central depot this
morning three mail clerks protruded
their heads from their cars and shout
ed: "Hurrah for the White Sox!'
That was the greeting at the station,
but a more vociferous one was given
them as they entered their hotel and
they had a hard time getting to the
desk and finally to their rooms.
The special train carrying the Chi
cago rooters, 900 strong, is not due
till tomorrow morning, but Cleveland
was represented by a full delegation,
and it was this crowd that helped
make the White Sox welcome at their
hotel. '
Both Manager Gleason of the White
Sox and Manager Moran of the Reds
gave TOice to their confidence that
their teams would be returned win
ners of not only the first game but
of the entire series, and both paid
compliments to each other by stating
that they knew that they had a fight
ob their hands.
Review to Furnish
Fans With Scores
Chicago and Cincinnati cross bats
today in the first game o fthe world's
championship series for 1919. At i
o'clock the returns are due at tl'e

Russian Bully Now
Fears U. S. Women
OMSK, via Vladivostok. (Corres
pondence of the Associated Press.)
A certain Russian bully learned
something about American women
that will lurk in his memory for
onmo fimo ihrnnirh an WICftltntw 9.
few days ago with Miss Annie Lau
Irle Williams in the freight yards at
Omsk?. Miss Williams' name win
be familiar to many New Yorkers as
a welfare worker. She is now with
the American Red Cross and was
one of those 12 women chosen to
remain behind when the others were
hustled out of Omsk by the Ameri
can ambassador to Japan, Roland S.
Morris, to escape a possible Bolshev
ik invasion. '
The Russian was attempting to
climb cboard a car in a refugee
train in which were several girls.
The girls were trying to shut the
car door against him. when "Miss
Williams appeared and grappled with
the intruder. She managed to land
two blows on his jaw and then they
rolled together down the embank
ment. As they arose she gave him
another.
Mickel Reilly, another fighter who
is well known to Warren district
fans, i3 now in El Paso.
All indications here are that a
large number of Warren district
friends of the squared circle will
tend the Lincoln-Manilla "go" in
Douglas. Betting here yesterday was
10 to 8, with Lincoln the favorite.
TT C Trife hackstoD for the Bis
bee nine, left yesterday for Yuma,
where he will Dlay in the winter
league. Other players who are sched
uled to follow him to the Colorado
river town are Kingsley and Galle-gos.
After bavins been drubbebd by
the Bisbee bunch- of ball tossers on
Sunday to the tune of 7-6, the wui
cox nine will disband, according to
word tent to Manager J?rencn yes
terday.
Bisbee may cross r.n3 witn iuc
aon nit Sur.risv. if there are indi
cations that the fans would like ti
see the match. Tucson was matcnea
with Willcox, but the declaration
of the latter team that it will play
together no more this . season gives
Bisbee a chance at the northerners.
So gratified are the ranchers ot
Cochise county over the success of
the Warren district municipal market
at Lowell, and so certain of its future
worth, that many of them have al
ready started to plant winter vege
tables, with the idea of furnishing
continued supplies during all of tho
winter months. This announcement
was made yesterday by Ira B. Jorale
mon. who has been prominently iden
tified with the movement since its
inception.

The Lincoln-Manilla fight, sched

BULGARS ADMIT GUILT
THE TREATY of peace handed to the delegates of Bulgaria is a
pretty all-embracing document, and while it does not prescribe
servitude for the Bulgars, which one of their delegates seemed
to fear, it does provide a. fair measure of retribution for the
crimes committed In the name of Kultur by Germany's late partner
in war.
General Theodorcff, heading the Bulgarian commission, pleads
that the people of his country were not responsible for the war, but
that the government had thrown the country inlo the struggle. But
he does realize that the people must share in the responsibility. If
that is generally understood, it will make the business of compliance
with the terms easier. .
Territorially Bulgaria cedes Western Thrace to the allied and
associated powers and the western frontiers are to be modified in
four places to Serbia's advantage. In a military way the Bulgar
army is to be demobilized and a volunteer army of twenty thousand
men formed. Also the navy is reduced to nothing. ' Really, disarma
ment appears to be making some progress. There is a money re--paration
exacted two and a quarter billion francs which i3 ad
mitted to be inadequate, yet comparable to Bulgaria's ability to pay.
In other respects the treaty follows the lines of that made with
Austria. The treaty is expected to be signed sometime next month.
All in all Bulgaria has no just cause for complaint. Consider
ing the sins committed, that country gets off easily.
MAKING AMERICANS
THERE is a great deal of verbal and written propaganda on be
half of the Americanization of aliens who presumably will some
day become citizens of the United States. Mufch of this misses
fire, but there is a value to such propaganda. It does help to
create an atmosphere and is a very direct, recognition of the signal
work done by the older workers in the cause of Americanization, in
the schools and out of them, and, by arousing a general feeling of
urgency that "something must be done," it does give those who have
been carrying on the Americanization movement a chance to make
themselves heard and to be sympathetically received when they
speak out.
Of course every sensible American believes in doing everything
possible to bring about amalgamation of the alien elements among
us. And it might be said in this connection that there are consider
able numbers of native born citizens who take altogether too easily
their civic duties. They would be better teachers if they were better
students of government and more active personally on behalf of
good politics. After all it is the schools which must give the first
lessons in Americanization Later it largely depends on the indi
vidual. Instruction first and example all the time will win in the
" long run.
A WHOLESOME EXPERIENCE
THE UNITED STATES employment bureau reports a genuine
scarcity of labor throughout the land, especially on the farms.
Well, if the cost of living doesn't drive the consumers back to
the farms, or forward to the farms, as the case may be, then
the country is in a sad way. There must be more production and
better distribution of farm products. If the agricultural life does
not appeal to a larger percentage of the population from the stand
point of attractiveness, why then it must soon appeal from necessity
as 8 means of livelihood under an economic situation whoich has
reached such a point that the problem of "making both ends meet"
has come to occupy altogether too large a portion of most persons'
time has monopolized the time of the majority in a manner that
begins to smak jujst a bit of slavery.
It would indeed be a healthy sort of lesson for many Americans
to practice real manual labor such as their parents, or perhaps their
grandparents, knew. The exodus of foreigners is bringing nearer
the necessity for and the probability of such a wholesome experience.
ZIONISM EXPECTANT
TO NON-JEWISH observers who are yet keenly interested in the
Zionist movement, there is something of the reassurance in the
result of the election of officers at the Zionist convention at
Chicago this week. The factions there discovered to be in con
test give some hint of the differences in Zionistic purposes which
might, if followed with too much insistence, have a disruptive ten
dency, delaying if not preventing the success of the plan to establish
a Jewish State in Palestine. Reassurance comes in the fact that
the extremists who wish their Palestine State to be socialistic, as
well as those who would form it on the basis of religion, were out
voted by the conservative elements who seek to have the proposed
State established as a political entity, leaving the question as to
socialistic or religious form to be determined later as matter of de
tail. Those who have followed the proceeding of this convention as
reported In the newspapers can hardly fail to have remarked the
tremendous enthusiasm shown over the presiding officer's reference
to Louis D. Brandeis, justice of the United States Supreme Court,
as "the great silent leader." No doubt that demonstration was in
large measure a recognition of Justice Brandeis' worth as a man
and as a promoter of the Zionistic purpose, and a welcome to him on
his return from visiting overseas countries, particularly that one In
Which Zionists are primarily interested. But the acclaim was sig
nificant also of the fact that what may be described as the center
of gravity of the Zionist movement Is now, through the effects of the
war, shifted from Europe to America, and America, whose interest
in Zionism Is perhaps perspnified in Justice Brandeis, is expected
to provide the major financial support required by th movement,
owing to the fact that the burden or war has weighed more heavily
on' overseas countries than' on the western side of the Atlantic. ' The
J eniniisiaim of .'that acclaim for the American justice," and the thou-
sands of Zionists who took part in it. are a guaranty that the move
' ment will continue to grow and that the call to the Jewish people
of America will not be In vain.

hope of the present dainy season

terfere with traffic, however. i

STATE EXHIBITS WIN
PRIZES AT EXPOSITION.
PHOENIX, Sept. 30. According to
a dispatch from Malcolm Frazer, sec

ONE DEAD, ONE INJURED;
RESULT OF ROCK FIGHT.
GLOBE, Sept.. 30 Sabino Vidai, one
of the Mexicans injured during the
rock fight in South Globe last Mon
day, died at the county hospital at
9:30 o'clock last night. Vidal's head
was badly crushed by stones during
conscious from the time of the fight
until he passed away last night.
Jose Diaz, who was also injured in
ihl ficht la in 9 tirrQ rmn pnnftl.
tion and he is not expected to sur-l
vive the night.
Mike Valenzuela and Amador Vidal
are confined in the county jail
charged with participating in the
rock fight. The lads are under 21
years of age and their case will prob
ably be heard before the juvenile
court. A charge of murder will prob
ably be filed against one of the boys J
Mcnday morning, and in the event of
the death of Diaz both lads will be
charged with murder.
The quarrel is the outgrowth of a
feud that has been carried on in
South Globe for several months and
is said to have started bver the own
ership of a strip of land located op
posite the A. E. Roundhouse. The
case has been aired in the justice
court on several occasions, but the
principals settled their grievances be
fore the case came to trial.
Monday evening Jose Diaz was re
turning from work and when he
passed the Vidal house, it is alleged
that Senora Vidal and Sabinb Vidal
abused him and an argument ensued.
During the argument Diaz was stoned,
it is said, by Amador Vidal and his
father, Sabino Vidal. Tomia Valen
zuela, a young Mexican girl, entered
the argument and someone struck
her on the head with a stone, the
rock battle became general and the
Mexicans of the vicinity joined in the
melee. Mike Valenzuela stated at
the time of his arrest, that Sabino
Vidal struck at his mother and he
became enraged and hit Vidal with
a stone. Young Valenzuela admitted
at the time of his arrest that he
struck Vidal with a rock, but it is
not known whether Vidal's death re
sulted from ' the blow delivered by
Valenzuela or from wcuiids inflicted
earlier in the fight.
NEED COTTON PICKERS;
CROP IS ENDANGERED.
YUMA, Sept. 30. That the cotton
picking situntion in the Yuma valley
is a far more serious problem than
is generally conceded is the opinion
of Mr. J. W. Longstreth, agricultural
agent for Yuma county. At the pres
ent time, according to Mr. Long
streth, the Yuma valley could absorb
200 pickers and use the same until
the end of the season. These neces
sary pickers have not as yet material
ized, notwithstanding the efforts made
by agents in other fields to supply
the farmers' wants. However, last
week, a belated attempt to avert a
shortage, w&s made by the formation
of what is termed the Yuma Valley
Cotton Growers' Association, a ' part
nership formed for the purpose of im
porting Mexican labor to the Yuma
valley: , This association has ?n the
few days of its existence made ar
rangements with the United State?
government for the iraportatioa of
Mexican labor, and are making ar
rangements with traveling pasengcr
and freight agent, Banoioft, of iha
Southern Pacific railroad for ih?i:
transportation to the Yuma valley.
It is also expected Dy some that a
few pickers will drift from the west.
TWO ARRESTED ON
CHARGE OF RIFLING VAULT.
TUCSON, Sept. 30. Manuel Gon
zales, porter and watchman in th
White House store, and John Doras,
a native of Porto Rico, were arrested
at Npgales, Sonora, yesterday charg
ed with the theft of $400 from the
safe of the White House store, early
yesterday morning.
The arrest was the result of a tele
phone order from Sheriff Miles, sent
out when it was reported that the
safe was found open yesterday morn
ing and the porter was missing. Three
hundred dollars was reported to have
been recovered from Gonzales.
Reports from Nogales indicate that
Chief of Police J. Lowe got on the
trail of the men shortly after they ar
rived and trailed them across the
line. Ho notified Chief of Police Ti
burcio Ruiz of Nogales, Sonora, who
sent his men out and rounded up Gon
zales and Dorks. Sheriff Raymon
Earhart sent his deputies to the line
and received the men from the Mex
ican police.

KING COTTON'S STATUTE
WILL SOON BE DONE.
YUMA. Sept- 30. An attractive
feature of the decorations in Somer
ton during the coming fair will be a
colossal statue of "King Cotton,"
which will be erected on the street
near the fair grounds. This statue
will be a replica of Uncle Sam wear
ing a crown of cotton, and his rai
ment will likewise be emblamativc or
one of the principal resources of this
section. It will be eighteen feet high
and dulv DroDortioned. with resard to
build. iThe head and shoulders arv
already' finished and work on the rest
of the Btatue is advancing rapidly. F.
J. Adams, our local artist, is the
sculptor. This Btatue shows high
class work so far, work of a kind that
even old Michael Angelo. the famous
sculptor, were he alive, would not be
ashamed to father.
THE PRINTER MAN
The printer man stands by his fonts
Throughout the livelong night,
And sets, with nimble mind and hands,
The verses that I write.
He whistles as his fingers fly,
He's cheerful, aye, and gay,
I sometimes think, while watching him,
That all his task is play.
He's never grouchy, never sad,
He always wears a smile,
Although he's worldly wise, I know.
And rather full of guile.
We work together through the night,
In everything we do,
And so I think that he and I
Are really the Review.
PEPY'S DIARY IN BISBEE
Sept. 30. Lay long in bed, thinking this was payday and wondering
what I should do with all my money, until the telephone rang, and my loss
did ask if I knew that we were going to get another paper this day, which
made me dress speedily. To the restaurant, where I ordered mush and milk,
but did find a fly iu my coffee, which made me so wroth that I glared at
the waiter stormily, but said nothing , as discretion is ever the better part
of valor. To the office, where I worked well, although disturbed by my
poor breakfast. To Mr. Willis, who writes much for the magazines, and
knows many in California with whom I also am acquainted. Talked long
with him, and found it very pleasant. To the council meeting, where I list
ened to much talk, but found some merry thoughts in it, as it was my first
opportunity to acquaint myself with these men. Met also with those who
are behind the road race, and much pleased to see the standing Bisbee has
with them and with all of El Paso. Did talk with Mr. Ryan, the highway
engineer, but nothing of politics, although I had a question or two to ask
him but considered another time the better. Much news the night before
from the police, who are mighty spry. Did taste a Wobbly's raisin brandy,
which seemed good, although new and bootleg. Thence again to the office,
where I talked long with Miss L., the assistant cashier, Who was mighty
pleasant until she discovered that I have a wife and four children. But
she smiled at me later, so I think she will not hold her temper long. The
cashier not feeling well today, but he gave me a good cigar, which tasted
well, and did challenge me to billards, at which I think I can best him.
So, to bed, hoping that the dead one who cranks his motorcycle outside my
window every morning will see this and move slightly down the block.
o
El Paso is betting that the fastest time made in the coining road race
will be through Cochise county and they say that Charlie Roberts and
I. C. E. Adams are not behind the money, either.
: o
The year's big story breaks today. What? Why, the world's series,
with the White Sox just a shade the favorites. Eeat 'em, Cinci, or yours
truly goes without square meals for a month.
"He pinched me," said the fair defendant in Judge Winter's court Tues
day. Well, he is a deputy sheriff, isn't he?
Turning Back , the Calendar
Sixteen Years Ago Today In Bisbee
(From the Bisbee Daily Rev
A bold hold-up was staged last
night at about 11 o'clock at the Shat
tuck lumber yards in Brewery Gulch
when two men, Tom De Priest and
another Unknown man struck over
the head with a 2 by 4 scantling a
man whose name has not yet been
learned. Before they could rob him
they were pounced upon by George
Chidester who had been following
them on account of their suspicious
movements. He ordered them to
throw up their hands but they both
ran, oue toward tne houses of ill
fame further up the Gulch and the
ether past the Review office and into
the Brewery saloon where he was
arrested by Jennings and Chidester
and placed in the jail.

There are now new developments
in the extradition of Bert Nofts, the
young man who is in jail at Cananea,
Sonora, charged with being' one of the
men who held up the Shaiiuck saloon
on the morning of August 19. Under
Sheriff J. C. Callaghan went to Cana
nea yesterday armed .with the proper
credentials which will be presented
to the Mexican officials in an effort to
bring Nofts to this side of the line.
Work on the addition to the county
court house was stopped this after
noon at 4:30, it being alleged by Su
pervisor Thomas York that the speci
fications are not being complied with
in that they require that ten inche..
of concrete be placed under the found
ation of the walls of the addition and
this has not been done by the contractors.
A serious wreck occurred on the El
Paso and Southwestern in the Bisbee
yards damaging a Mogul engine to
the extent of $2500. An engine pull
ing six loaded cars from the Calumet
and Arizona ore bins backed onto the
side track with its load, leaving the
loaded cars there until it could pull
out six empties. In passing the load
ed train, which was not entirely in
the clear, the fittings along the left
side of the engine were torn off.
J. S. Douglas, superintendent of the
Montezuma Copper company, is in the
city having arrived from Nacozari.
Mr. Douglas reports construction
work on the Nacozari railroad pro
ceeding without interruption.
WHAT OTHER PAPERS SAY
.
HIS ARITHMETIC.
New York Herald.
President Wilson's assertion that
America's one. vote in the League of
Nations is equal to the six votes of
the Empire of Great Britain may ex
plain why during a long career at
professoring Mr. Wilson was nevt..
once chosen to be a professor of
mathematics.
CASE OF BULGARIA.
New York World.
Bulgaria was drawn to the German
cause against the interests and prob
ably the wishes of her people. She
cannot escape her day of reckoning
and it is now seen to be a bitter one.
I ut recognition of her right to a
trade outlet, possibly international
ized, is not to be denied without sow.
ing the seeds of a new and needles
war.
FOLLOWING RUSSIA'S. LEAP
New York Tribune.
' The steel strike shows again ' the
temper of Bolshevist labor loaders
like Fitzpatrick and Plumb. They
still regard Lenine as the master
economist and Russia as the Land oi
Promise. The theories behind, their
cusade are prevalent in all countries
thiown off their balance by the war.
They must be met. A steel strike,
with socialization as its aim, was In
evitable Perhaps now is the best
time for it to break. The public turn
ed against the Plumb plan for the
railroads as soon as it understood it.
It will probably resent Mr. Fitz
pat rick's effort to warm that nostrum
ever the use in the steel industry.
OUTSIDERS NOT ADMITTED.
New York Sun.
But he (Judge Gary) declines to
treat concerning the affairs of his
business with these organizers of in
dustrial i evolution, these trained rep
resentatives of a super-government
ntiw trying to subject to its extrane
ous authority tho interests and move
ments of a great majority of his em
ployes. He has no olive branch tor
the outsiders who demand in tho
name of federated labor the abolition
o fthe existing unions in the Steel
Corporation's vast system and the
.transfer of industrial allegiance to an
organization represen'-.-d in this case
by at least one avowed prophet of
syndicalism and confiscation. And
this is a fair statement, as The Sun
understands it, of the olive branch
issue.

Bearish sentiment dominatea corn
most of the day .although the break
in hog values was counterbalanced
somewhat by assertions that corn had
of late declined to a greater relative
extent than hogs. The downward ten
dency of foreign exchange was like
wise more or less offset by rains
which might delay the curing of new
corn. Besides, a temporary bulge In
corn prices took place about midday,
induced by hasty assumptions on the
part of a number of traders that the
Edge bill to facilitate exports would
soon tecome a law and that war time
prohibition would be repealed. There
was much belated liquidation at the
last however, especially in the Septem

Oats merely paralleled the action of
corn.

DISMISS CASE AGAINST FARM

dismissed yesterday afternoon upon
the motion of Assistant County Attoi-i
ncy Reark. who it is supposed was '
mere to look axier the interests ot
Miss Berry. Roark is an attorney,5
according to the police.
Ministers, doctors and attorneys,'
prominent in Bisbee and Douglas,!
were interested spectators at the
hearing. It was difficult for the speo-
tators to refrain from laughing at the
feeble effort of Roark in his prosecu-
tion. No objections during the firsv McDonald refused to have Brown's

but we, the taxpayers, are paying
your salary, and I am not sure but

Roark squirmed back to his orig

no more advice.
Attempts by the various witnesses
to prove Miss Eerry's character was
bad, introduced by. the defense, were
not particularly successful. All that

Speaking on "The Prison House of
God." the Rev. Fr. J. Foulkes, member
of the Society of Jesus, who is con
ducting a mission or spiritual retreat
during this week at St. Patrick's
church, delivered an address last
night to an audience which filled the
edifice almost to overflowing. Th
eloquent and learned Jesuit, who is
engaged in holding a series of mis
sions throughout the southwest, ana
who has just completed a retreat at
Douglas, took as his theme the pun
ishments of hell, their certainty to
the sinner, and the eternity of their
existence.
"I have. Bat at the feet of eloquent
divines," sal dthe speaker, "and i
have listened while they attempteu
to portray the awfulness of hell. .

This would be at least a semblance
of iair play by the sheriff. McDon-
aid, when questioned a few days ago,
replied that French, the county ai-
torney, was investigating Brown.
Brown still holds office. From yesr
terday's motion to dismiss the case

L'erry is denied the rights that even
a criminal sentenced to be hanged is

McDonald on the phone and ask if the
reporter could interview Miss Berry

But Jimmy curtly refused, replying
that "under the circumstances I do

effect, as transmitted by Misa Berry's
jailer after conversing with McDon-

from Miss Berry regarding the triai,
