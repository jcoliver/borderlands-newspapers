ALL THE SKILL OF GENERAL VON

TO HOLD BACK AMERICANS AND
FRENCH FROM VITAL POSI
TIONS ON RIDGE
WITH THE AMERICAN ARMY IN
FRANCE. Aug. 29 (By the Associated
Press). Late this afternoon the Amer
icans held positions in the fighting
line in the Soissons region extending
in a northerly direction from Chav
igny. All the skill of General Von Schwer
in. commanding the seventh guard di
vision is being exercised to hold back
the Americans at their point in the
line north of Soissons and save the
Americans at thwir point in the line
north of Soissons and save the Ger
mans from the menace they would be
under if the allies occupied the pla
teau extending further Howard the
east.
Recovering before the day ended
from the shock of the early morning
attack. Von Schwerln brought into
play his artillery and other resources
in a desperate effort to check the
movement. Equally determined ef
forts were made by fhose organized
in front of the French divisions on
the right and left of the Americans.
Reports from points on the line
where the attack is in progress indi
cate that the Americans are confront
ed by what is believed by many to
be one of the most determined stands
yet taken by the Germans, who rea
lize that a break at any point would
likely be followed by disaster.
The opinion seems to be that every
yard of territory gained will be bitter
ly contested and that It Is not improb
able that villages and' other objectives
will be subjected to the fate of cap
ture and recapture many times be
fore their possession is undisputed. '
The rapidity with which the gains
were made by the Americans and
French early in the day was not dup
licated in the afternon when the bat
tle settled into a strong artillery duel
in w hich the 'guns of both sides fired
often at direct targets and at unus
ually close range.
The country which, has been the bat
tle field almost four years again is the
scene of a conflict which has started
out with the promise of being most
stubbornly fought. Tonight the sky
is dotted with, flashes of exploding
shells, while the roar of the barraga
and counter barrage must be audible
almost to Paris. In the back areas
shells are falling behind the lines but
not so frequently as at many times
previously. The Germans apparently
are using all their guns and energy In
attempting to tear down the deter
mined lines of their advancing enemy.
How many hundreds of thousands
of little guns the Germans have Im
mediately in front or the Americans
is not known. Every hillside, ravine
and wood crackles with their fire
whenever approached. And it has
been in the fact of their restructive
fire that the Americans and French
have been moving.
Comparatively little gas has been
employed by the enemy. There have
arrived at the dressing stations a few
cases of men suffering from mustard
gas but most of them encountered it
in shell holes, hollows and depressions
where it was old, but still effective.
As the day passed the visibility im
proved and the aviators of both sides
became more active. Those of the
allies rendered valuable assistance in
observation work.

Without Record Vote Senate
Adopts Leaders' Compro
mise for Bone Dryness July
1,1919 '
(Ttv Review I.ensed Wire)
WASHINGTON. Aug. 29 National
prohibition moved a considerable step
forward today in congress.
Without a record vote being taken
or requested, the senate today adopted
the leaders" compromise on "hone dry"
prohibition, effective July 1, 1919, and
continuing during the war and until
the American troops are brought home
and demobilized.
The compromise, an amendment by
Senator Sheppard of Texas, prohlDf
tion leader, to the $11,000,000 emerg
ency agricultural appropriation bill, is
expected to remain in the measure un
der the harmony agreement of "wet"
and "dry" factions, although technic
ally subject to another vote. Passage
of the bill itself is planned tomorrow
aud the measure will be returned to
the house, which is expected by prohi
bition advocates to accept the senate
provision.
Efforts to change materially the
Sheppard substitute were futile.
Amendments to advance and defer the
effective date and to extend the time
for its operation against beer and
wine were overwhelmingly defeated
wtihout record roll calls.
That there was any agreement
among the leaders against having rec
ord votes was denied by Senator
Sheppard and other advocates ana
(also opponents of prohibitory legisla
1 tion.
Senator Phelan of California, made
a vigorous fight for a longer lease of
life for the wine and beer industry.
He offered amendments making the
effective date for their prohibition
June 30. 1920, instead of a year pre
vious, as the amendment provides, and
also applying the later date to wines
alone. Both were rejected overwhelm
ingly by viva voce votes and sufficient
senators did not support Senator Phel
ans request for a roll call. Another
Phelan amendment drowned In a roar
of "noes" would have exteneded the ef
fective date for wines six months long
er, or until December 31, 1919.
Senator Thomas of Colorado, op
posed the amendment because he de
clared the government needs all pos
sible revenue sources and because it is
not a war prohibition measure, being
effective too long distant. He also
objected to the provision In the amend-
fCnntlmiert on Turn Four)
materia! necessary for makiiig the
change.
The order for submission of
rates does nt affect the n .tii p of

control, sU'in.; that "until furtl er
notice the t lesraph and t lephone
companies shall continue opera
tion in the ctdinary coursr of

explained. that approval must be
given before new rates actually go

CHICAGO, Aug. 29. Federal Judge
K. M. Landis today, after denying a
new trial to the luo I. W. W. leaders
recently found guilty of anti-war con
spiracy later granted three of the de
fendants continuances of their cases
and announced that the remaining
ninety-seven will not be sentenced un
til tomorrow afternoon. 'This decision
was reached only'after Judge Landis
had listened to the individual story of
each defendant. He was visibly af
fected by the stories of some and
showed every inclination to give each
defendant the benefit of any doubt
that might exist.
Nearly three and a half hours were
occupied with the speeches of the de
fendants and at the end of this time
Judge Landis announced that so much
new matter had been introduced that
he - wished .time to consider the new
evidence.
William D. (Big Bill) Haywood, secretary-treasurer
of the I. W. W- was
one of the last to step before the. bar
iof justice. Cool and collected, he said:
"I feel that a verdict in this case is
one of the greatest mistakes ever per
petrated on a court of justice. No
member cf the I. W. W. is guilty of
any act against the I'nited States. If
released there is nothing I could do
but to continue to uphold the I. W. W.
constitution as I have done in the
past."
Attorney Vanderveer entered a spe
cial plea in behalf of J. A. McDonald,
editor of the Industrial Worker of Se
attle, Wash., who is suffering from tu
berculosis. Mr. Vanderveer recom
mended that some provision he made
for McDonald because of his condi
tion. Anson E. Soper. of Astoria. Ore..
when called before the court, offered
to take upon himself the sentence of
his friend. Norval G. Marlatt. if Judge
Landis would permit the latter to re
turn to his wife and babies.
"I am not." he said, "a man with a
hard face and soft hands, as the prose
cutor said. I. have worked for thirty
eight years in essential industries."
Later, when Joe I'sapiet was called.
Judge Landis called Marlatt anil told
him and I'sapiet that they were grant
ed a continuance until the first Mon
day of November because of extenuat
ing circumstances.

East, Clark and Wilbert Will
Figure on County's Quota
of Skilled and Unskilled
Labor
A meeting at which the quota of
skilled and unskilled labor for Cochise
county will be figured out by James
II. East and Harry A. Clark of Doug
las, and R. J. Wilbert of Bisbee. mem
bers of the Bisbee-Douglas community
labor board, will take place this morn
ing in Douglas. In the belief of Mr.
Wilbert, great difficulty will be expe
rienced in this county iln gathering
the desired quota, as the men are not
here. However, this will be threshed
over along with other points, at to
day's meeting.
The instructions sent out by the
federal director of labor for Arizona,
includes the list of names of the heads
of the county boards, under whose Ci
rection the various volunteer agents
of the United States public service
reserve should work. Mr. East is
the director for this county.
Under the rules, the county direc
tor is responsible to the federal ci
rector of the state. 'All reports and
correspondence of enrolling agents in
this county should be transmitted
through Mr. East, as county director,
and by him will be forwarded to the
state director in Phoenix. In order to
simplify the mailing of calls for cer
tain classes of workers and technical
men, these will be sent direct to en
rolling agents. Applications and let
ters from applicants sliould be trans
mitted directly through the county
chairman. The state director requests
strict compliance with this provision,
in order that the county director may
be familiar with the entire work in
his county.
The first call sent out for technical
men is for men experienced In rail
road work, to be inducted Into the
railroad corps. These men must not
be of class 1-A of the draft, nor mem
bers of the class of 1918, and must be
physically fit for military duty and
below the age of 41. Men in limited
service can be taken if disqualifica
tion is not such as to interfere with
performance of their duties. Appli
cations from men now employed on
the railroads of the state will not be
considered, but those of men employed
in other lines, who possess the neecs
sary qualifications. The compensation
will be regular soldier's pay and allow
ances. The classes of men skilled in rail
road work include all grades from di
vision engieers ad engineers of
maintenance of way, draughtsmen,
yardmen, boilermakers and allied
crafts, machinists and clerks. The

path of the advancing machines there

earth scores of these guns.
There is unquestioned mastery of
the air by the allies along this front.
It has been misty this morning and
there was little effective aerial work
and practically none by the Ger
mans. Only a few prisoners are reported
as yet, the Germans apparently seeing
to it that only machine gun crews
should be sacrificed.
Just back of the lines there is a
mixture gf French and husky young
Americans. Truck trains and long
lines of artillery crowd all the roads,
but everywhere is that precision of
organization which prevents a jam for
more than brief intervals, this part
of the machine co-ordinating well with
that fighting a few miles beyond.
German prisoners were scarce at
the American lines today. Less than
a dozen were brought into division
headquarters, although a few others
passed through the dressing stations.

man guns being especially active. The
rains of the early evening ceased be
fore the ground had been converted
into mud, so when tiie orders were
given tcxljy the men moved forward
unimpaired.
The German positions were shclle.1
most vigorously by heavy guns, mor
tars and light pieces, firing almost
point blank, as well as by long range
r.aval guns which searched the posi
tions of the areas near. And then
the infantry advanced.
Up over the plateau the infantry
men vent towards Juvigny and across
the little railroad running north and
south. The Germans immediately be
gan to employ the tactics of similar
retreats, leaving their rear defendel
liy ,i line f machine guns hidden be
hind rvry clump of brush, promon
tory and woods. Only a few detach
ments rf infiin.ry v. re left, l lie en
emy adopting measures calculated to
i-ave. the most men possible.
Krt.n: Cr.urrnne Woods and another
lit'le j.lan:inp iike sentinels be
tween Juv'gny and the American lines,
the Germ-in guns delivered a deadly
cross fire. Juvigny is only a village,
but. loro'ed along the side of a hill,
it offered a peculiar opprrtnnity for
defense, until the advancing forces
movcl into position from which they
were able to make it untenable.
The Germans then retired further
rust into more broken ground. The
frontage assigned to the Americans
was less than two miles. That part
in which Juvigny was iocated was t'l"
scene of a dramatic tank drive.
1'nder the cover of artillery, the
licnt French tanks flirted along both
rides ol ;' path to the little, place
smashing down one machine gun nest
after another, in spite of the employ-j
nient by the Gern:ar.s their u"' ' ;

DRAW FEEBLE REPLY.
WITH THE AMERICAN ARMY ON
THE VESLE FRONT, Aug. 29, 8 p. m.
(BY THE ASSOCIATED PRESS.)
The Americans early in the day along
the Vesle front sent over a large num
ber of projectiles and gas shells
against the Germans, who replied fee
bly. Patrols were active on both Bides
during the night. The fighting line
remains unchanged.
American officers deny the German
assertion that 250 Americans were
made prisoners in recent fighting, say
ing that only a tew of their men are
missing.
NOGALES IS QUIET
AFTER SCARY DAY
(Continued from Page On)
the American garrison and patrol
guards from nearby army posts and
camps, tended to relax the tension and
tonight Nogales is as quiet as a quaker
settlement except for the presence of
an unusually large number of troops
and their appearance on the streets
and along the border.
Statement by Commanders
General Cabell, at military head
quarters tonight said:
"Peace and quiet prevails and
no further trouble is expected."

citizens from creating any further
excitement.''
General Cabell remained at military
headquarters all day directing the lo
cation of the forces and receiving re
ports from his intelligence depart
ment. Another conference was held
at the little footbridge which spans
an arroyo on the International line
which was attended by General Cabell
and General Calles, accompanied by
their staffs. The conference lasted
thirty minutes and ended as the whist
les were blowing for the noon hour.
Following the conference the Amer
ican commander announced that he
and the Mexican military governor had
reiterated the statements made at
their first conference yesterday after
noon. General Calles' statement that

ity to maintain order on the Mexican
side.

CONES AND SODA.
(By Kevlew Leased Wire)
NOGALES, Ariz., Aug. 29. Across
the width of an unpaved street Mexi
can and American sentries patrol their
posts tonight, the Mexican sentries
challenge of "alto" being echoed by
the command of "halt," the English
equivalent, as straggling civilians ap
proach too near the border.
The twin towns of Nogales, Ariz.,
and Nogales, Sonora, are armed camps
tonight, and the bugle calls from the
Mexican and American camps may be
heard plainly from opposite sides of
the boundary. Except for an unusual
number of. soldiers buying ice cream
cones and red soda pop in the stores
and on absence of women and chil
dren irom the streets at the hour
moving picture shows closed, the
American town pursued its normal
routine tonight. General Cabell's
statement that everything was quiet
and he anticipated no further trouble,
had a quieting effect upon the civilian
population, who had been ' under the
btress of excitement since Tuesday
afternoon.
Over in Mexico the quiet of the
tomb enveloped the little town of
adobe and brick. The port was re
opened yesterday afternoon and "many
of the Mexican residents of Nog!e,
Sonora, who worked on the American
side, returned to their homes after
a night and day spent in the plaza
here after the port was closed Tues
day. No one was permitted on the
streets there tonight except soldiers.

heavy resistance of the enemy and
crossed the Ailette river.
Northwest of Soissons, where the
Americans are jn the lin with the
French in the general, movement of
clearing Picardy of the enemy, there
has been severe fighting, but with
the allied troops having the advant
age. The American sector is between
Chavlgny and Juvigny, and the enemy
facing them includes the Prussian Sev
enth infantry.
Along the Vesle river at Pazoches
and Fismette, the situation is rather
less tense than it was Tuesday and
Wcdnesdav- when heavy fighting oc
curred between the Americans and
the Germans. Thursday the Ameri
cans heavily shelled the German po
sitions, but the Germans failed to ac
cept their challenge to a duel, and re
plied only feebly. The claim of the
German war office that 250 Americans
were made prisoners during the recent
fighting, is denied by the Americans,
who assert that only a few of their
men are missing.
The situation in Eastern Siberia
Beems to be somewhat clarified
through the disarming by the Czecho
slovaks of all the Russian volunteers
who revolted recently and took sides
with General Horvath, the antl-Bal-shevlki
leader.
The first big battle In which
sll the allied forces except the Ameri
cans took part, occurred last Saturday
when the enemy attacked but was
driven back. At last aeco'ints the al
lied troops were steadily advancing
against the enemy.
HUNS IN POCKET.
WITH THE FRENCH ARMY IN
FRANCE. Aug. 29. (By the Associ
ated Press, Evening.) The operations
cf the past two days have put the
Germans Into another pocket between
the Canal Du Nord and the River
Aisne. They will have to evacuate it
promptly or run a big risk of having
their positions there turned from the
north by the French, along the valley
of the Sonirao.
Since the fall of Noyon. which was
'he nnex of this salient until this
morning, Mont St. Simeon, a mile and
a quarter to the east, is its advanced
defense. This height dominates the
valley of the Aisne eastward, and the
'iev of the River Meve- and the
Canal Du Nord to the north. These
valleys were lines in the salient last
Dieht.
The taking of Quesnow wood this
morning has tightened the pocket
from the western side, bringing the
French within shelling distance of
the min read lending out of it in the
direction of Ham.
Betwen the roads to Ham and
Chauny a succession of heights ex
tending from Mont St. Simeon to
Chauny, form a position of preat
st"ncth. The Germans are violently
rhtling the French lines from thore
'rdriy, but the imminence 'if danger
threatening their communications to
the north sggests that they nre mer'
y usiiu part of their immense ammii
niticn supplies there to ease the pres
sure whi. h had become so stiong hs
to require them to abandon ammuni
tion all ovpr the field of the Avre.

obey orders. Nevertheless the enemy
Is offering the stiffest resistance.
South of the Somme the Germans
are retreating before the Australians.
The French to the south having reach
ed the banks of the Somme back
waters, the Australians are engaged in
clearing the enemy from the small
bit of ground remaining to him west
and south of the river within the
angle created by its course.
Uapaume has virtually been sur
rounded for. several days, British pa
trols having been in its western out
skirts, and it has just unofficially been
reported to have fallen.
' South of Bapaume the battle con
tinues. This afternoon the British
were east of Maurepas and Combles.
while Cinchy and Guillemont have
been stormed and captured. The Bri
tish are pushing on.
Other British troops this afternoon
beat down the opposition and are
moving through Thllloy, just south ot
Bapaume. The whole British line here
seems to be on the move. The Ger
mans are falling back, leaving large
numbers of machine guns on the
ground out of which they are being
pushed.
In the north heavy fighting is In pro
press on both Bides of Bullecourt and
in front of that town. Villers-Carbon-nel
and Barleux have been taken.
Within the past twenty-four hours
the Germans have launched several
heavy counter attacks, fresh troops be
ing employed.! In every case except
one the enemy was beaten back with
terrible losses, gaining no ground
whatsoever.
The one exception was a counter
attack south of Gavrelle, north cf the
Scarpe. where the Germans managed
to penetrate the British lines. But
they soon were driven out. The only
result was to carpet the ground in
front of the British with German
dead.
There has been extraordinarily
heavy fighting for Greenland bill. The
position was reached once by the
British but was relinquished during a
counter attack yesterday. It is now en
tirely British again. The British cap
tured many prisoners.
Just north of the Somme the Ger
mans are offering stiff resistance from
Hem on the north bank of the river
west of Pero one.
Except in the extreme north the
fighting is through villages which
have changed bands many times since
the war began. The ruins in some
cases became overgrown with weeds,
grass and poppies more than once,
only to be churned up again. Villages
reported from time to time to have
been captured are not villages at all.
They are simply mounds of debris.
In the distance now and then there
is a cloud of dust and smoke arising
from a "village" showing, where a
high explosive shell has just landed.
There is a body of khaki clad troops
swinging up, a road and one of war
battered Germans passing it on the
way to the rear toward the prison
cages.
This country is what the British
have been taking away from the Ger
mans but not far away there is land
that the war has not touched since
1914. The British are within less than
four miles of this country at the near
est point.

The cdiumitfce on jurisprudence and

a resolution containing a memorial ad

war. The committee, however, did not
believe tha. changes in the national
constitution arc necessary at this

Without expressing any opinion
upon either the prohibition or woman

it "unfortunate that sin h

decision at a time when the deepest
interest of cur people is engrossed in
the life and dea'h strncRle of the war,"
and action on the resolution was In
definitely postponed.

ANONYMOUS LETTERS
WILL BE PLACED IN
THE WASTE BASKET
KREBS SAYS IT IS USELESS TO
SEND UNSIGNED LETTERS AS
BOARD WILL PAY ABSOLUTELY
NO ATTENTION TO THEM;
WANT BONAFIDE INFORMATION
Wishing to impress upon the public
of Cochise county that annymous
letters' sent to the local board of Co
chise county, will absolutely get not
the least bit of attention, but will be
relegated to the waste basket. Secre
tary Ray E. Krebs of the local board
yesterday issued a statement to that
effect. Several letters were received
in today's mail, that possibly may have
contained some valuable information
had the writer signed his or her name.
Such letters are received almost daily
but they all go to the sajne place, the
waste basket.
The board, however, is desirous of
receiving information from residents
of the county, and welcomes such
when it is properly sent with a signed
communication. All such letters are
kept in absolute strict confidence, as
are other papers relating to the draft,
and will not be given out should the
occasion not require it.
Secretary Krebs stated that he be
lieved many do not understand this
and believes their letter will be given
consideration if they do not sign them,
and he wishes it positively under
stood that a person who has inten
tions or has sent an annonymous let
ter, may as well not send thm for
the good they have accomplished.
Any person having any matter of
information to give to the board must
sign their letters or either not waste
a stamp to send it.

ADAMS' GIANTS ARE
AGAIN THE VICTORS
The second game of the series be
tween Adams' Giants and Brownlie's
Cubs was played at the Y. gym last
night. Adams' Giants were again vic
torious, defeating their opponents by
a score of 27 to 19. The score was
very close up until the last ten min
utes of the game. Brownlie's team
lead during the first half, but the su
perior playing of the Giants. began to
tell after the middle of the second
half.
Especial mention is due the playing
of Griffith Williams, who made a total
of fourteen points during the game,
helping materially to pile up the score
for the Giants.
Until further plans are formulated
for thp league the above two teams
will play every Thursday and Monday
nights at 8 o'clock. Other teams are
invited to join the league, and the
boys are especially anxious that the
Guards at Lowell should join the team
and they promise to show them a good
time if they join. Last night's lineup
was as follows:
Hrownlie, 1. f (capt.) Kellum, 1. f..
Muat, r. f Williams, 1. f.
Higgins, center. .Adams, cen. (capt.)
Frasco, 1. g Debely, 1 g.
Nicholas, r. g Baldwin, r. g.
Glendenning. sub Sands, sub.
The gallery was filled with an even
larger crowd than last time, and they
were on thir feet through most of
the game, so great was the interest
taken In the game.
C. & A. TEAM TO
PLAY J.-B.'S SUNDAY
The C. & A. baseball team will play
the Junction Briges team Sunday aft
ernoon at the Warren irk, nnd a hot
game may be anticipated by the fans..
The Junction Brfggs team had in
tended to go to Fort Huachuca for
a game Sunday, but owing to condi
tions at Nogales and the heavy with
drawal of troops from the post, this
plan was changed.
The; batteries for Sunday's game
have not been announced yet.

NEW YORK, Aug. 29 Foreign ad
vices, as indicated by the continuous
sweep of the allied forces and domes
tic developments, including publica
tion of many excellent railroad state
ments fur July, were distinctly lavor
ki. tr..i -iv i.nt the stock market
lapsed into apathy, with moderate

I The change in sentiment was large

"corrective" measures against specu
lation on borrowed money and reports
from Washington to the effect that
the next Liberty loan is likely to ag

Important railway systems reported
substantial gains in operating and net
incomes, although Canadian Pacific
disclosed a large decrease and the St.

GRAIN MARKET.
CHICAGO, Aug. 29. Corn prices
tried to rally at the opening today, but
the effort overtaxed their strength and
the relapse carried them 17 to 2
cents under yesterday, which marks
a decline of about 16 cents since a
week ago yesterday. The rally, which
advanced quotations something over
2 cents, was due largely to hesitancy.
The bulge merely brought out more
selling. Routine news was colorless
and warmed over. October closed at
$1.54.
Hedging sales were again evident
in the oats market. No. 3 cash corn
widened the discount under September
to Hie and standard grades to iic,
While the market was influenced by
corn, the closing loss of 4c indicated
a comparatively greater strength. Oc
tober closed at 71c.
Provisions were dull. There was a
bulge early with hogs, but profit-taking
followed and the close was un
changed at 7c under yesterday.

J Too Much Optimism
It is both a fault and a virtue with the
American public that it is too easily swayed
by its emotions. Only a short, quick step
is needed to bridge that distance between
optimism and that station that is the abid
ing place of the pessimist. We blame too
quickly and we praise too highly. Hope and
despondency chase each other across our
minds like the shadow and sunshine across
a field in summer. This is especially so in
the war. A local victory is chronicled upon
the western front and we say in our haste
that the war will soon be over.
How many citizens, office and business
men as well as worker and clerk, read the
war news carefully and thoroughly and
turn to a map of Europe once in a while
to learn something about the actual cause
and effect of a victory or defeat? Surely
not many, if one should judge by the ex
pressions one hears on the streets these
days. And not alone in the Warren dis
trict, but from every section of the country
the more thoughtful writers and speakers
are urging us againsct the error of an opti
mism Uiat comes too soon and is brighter
and stronger than the war news can pos
sibly warrant.
A western manufacturer went to Wash
ington only last week and talked and
bought supplies for his factory on the sup
position that the war would soon be over.
Asked upon what he based his judgment,
and he replied that it was upon the victories
Foch was winning east of Amiens. He
thought the river Rhine was only a few
steps eastward of Foch's advancing legions.
If he had looked at his map he would
have noted at a glance that Foch is one
hundred and sixty-five miles from the
Rhine. He would have also seen that Foch
has reconquered only a little more than half
of the French land lost this year before the
German drives. If he had studied the fig
ures cf the war, he would have known that
the Germans have not yet used all their re
serves and that they had massed for another
drive.
In other words, Foch has simply wrested
the offensive frcm our enemies and is
striking him some sharp blows and beating
him on local sectors one after the other and
driving him back to the old Hindenburg
line, the line that stopped the allies dead
last year and cost them so many brave men
in fruitless attacks.
It is true that it is different this year.
We may well pass the Hindenburg line ir.
the next fortnight and force a great retreat
and inflict much more severe losses. But
again we may not. It is only conjecture
and hope based, it may be, too, upon proba
bilities. But in this war both Germans and
the allies have rallied time and again from
defeat and driven forward to victory. The
chance, however, against the Germans be
ing able to rally again are many and dark.
He lacks the men. He has no other Rus
sian front from which to draw them. But
he is far from beaten. No vital blow has
been delivered against him. He is not in
rout or panic. He is withdrawing hastily
and is losing many men and guns, but he
is fighting savagely all along the line.
Newspapers more than a week ago an
nounced that Bapaume had fallen. An
nounced in black headlines a foot high.
And yet Bapaume only fell yesterday. We
were held up there until the Germans could
get most of their men and guns and stores
away. Many times lately great newspapers
have announced across their front pages
the startling but unfounded facts that the
allies had from two hundred to four hun
dred Germans in a trap. We have never
trapped more than two thousand Germans
reeling German lines," and of the "dire
peril that threatens the German armies,'
let us consider what these words really
mean. They indicate only that the Hun
must fall back quickly to other lines of de
fense that he has prepared, and there to
recoup for another savage thrust, it may
well be.
Behind the Hindenburg line, over fifty
miles behind, to be exact, lies the line of the
Meuse, and it is still in the eastern edge of
France, and it is much stronger than the
Hindenburg line. And one hundred miles
behind the Meuse lies the line of the Rhine,
and it is stronger than the Meuse line. And
behind the line of the Rhine lies many and
stronger lines.
It is a long and hard way to Berlin,
mates.
It is well to be confident; we have a right
to be cherful. We ought to be optimistic
of the final result. But it is a mistake to
think of the early end of the war. Ger
many has great strength yet, so far as we
know with any certainty. Of course it is
not to be expected that she will be able to
survive many more defeats and a long con
tinuation of her severe losses of the past
six weeks. We may well reach and pass
the Meuse line more easily and quickly
than we shall pass the Hindenburg line,
for the enemy morale must fall low with
constant defeat and retreat. But this is no
time to figure on these fond hopes and
probabilities of the future. This is the time
to bravely figure on a big, hard job ahead
that has only begun, and it is not half done,
as we may be led to believe from cheering
news from Picardy.
It is true also that the German railway and
war industries and general war resources
from behind the lines may well break any
day, or weaken until felt at the front
enough to bring disaster. But they are
fools and shortsighted as moles who count
on this. More than a year ago we talked
and hoped for these things, and then came
the most powerful effort Germany had
made in the entire war.
Let us, therefore, work and give and
ficht and pray and do and plan as though
we still had a Germany as powerful a3 ever
to beat to her knees. The terrible fighting
of the last month may have to be repeated
many times and with three times the force
before we reach the Rhine.
Beware the error of too much optimism !
It is not as bad as pessimism, but it may
well lead us into paths that lead not to Ber
lin and a real and victorious peace.
"GOLD DOLLARS" FOR 85 CENTS
(From the St. Louis Republic.)
Gold dollars are selling at eighty-five
cents this month. They are real dollars, is
sued and stamped by Uncle Sam, the best
money on earth, and all the purchaser has
to do in "order to realize the l 5 per cent in
crease in value is to put them away for a
few years. Meanwhile the eighty-five
cents will be helping win the war, thereby
adding to its own security and the value of
all other property in the United States.
It used to be said that some men were
so cautious they would not "buy gold dol
lars at ninety cents." Even the most con
servative was Viever accused of turning
down an opportunity to buy them at eighty-five
cents. The offer is open until Aug
ust 3 1 , after which the price will positively
advance. The place to take advantage of
it is anywhere thrift stamps and war sav
ings stamps are on sale. The slogan was
coined by the insurance men.
When the German line began to crack
it went fast. Roye, Chaulnes, Noyon, and
then last, Bapaume. They went in a row,
one after the other, these key positions.
Their fall means a considerable retreat for
the German invaders, that is certain and
sure, even without allied persuasion, but
the extent of this retreat and its costliness
to the Prussian depends upon how success
ful he has been in getting his men and guns
and stores back out of reach before he was
forced to give up these places. To be hurt
in his retreat he must be crowded hard. He
held Chaulnes for more than a week before
he was compelled to evacuate the town.
And he held on to Bapaume to the bitter
end. Yesterday he had heavy forces south
of this town. If he has not withdrawn
them by now he may well suffer great
losses. Broken, wounded, depressed, de
spondent, beaten, the Hunnish beast draws
back towards his own lair, turning savage
ly at bay from time to time. Can the dogs
bring him down? Not now, it is feared,
but it is to be hoped they can rend and
worry him until he is weakened and hurt
and will fall victim to the great hunting
next spring !

Sims, however, did not meet with en

the failure to carry it through was

have found that precedent is against
the Plan 01 having a unit of convicts
in the army," Mr. Sims said.
"I do not beiieve that the plan will
be tried, although I have found much
favorable comment on the scheme. It
would have given convicts who were

whose records hae been investigated

MEXICAN ACCUSED OF
SHOOTING AT SENTRY
HELD TO ACTION
SHERIFF GUY WELCH TAKES
MAURO SANDANTE THROUGH
. CITY TO TOMBSTONE TO ANS
WER ON CHARGE OF ATTEMPT
ED MURDER
Sheriff Guy Welch was in the city
last evening on his way so Tombstone
having in custody several prisoners
and the Cleve Irby auto loaded with
whiskey, which he was taking to the
county seat. One of the prisoners was
a Mexican named V.auro Sandante,
who is accused of firing a shot at one
of the soldiers on duty in Douglas the
other night. The Douglas Dispatch
yesterday morning had the following
to say in regard to rue allcved shoot-i
ing by Sandante:
Accused of firing a shot at an
American border palrolsman last
Tuesday night, Mauro Sandante yes
terday afternoon in Judge D. T. Dun
lap's court was held in $5000 bond to
appear in superior court. One army
officer and five soldiers ' testified
against the defendant, and a Winches
ter rifle, containing six shells, one
empty and the others loaded, was ex
hibit A. Also there was exhibited an
ammunition belt with fifteen shells.
The rifle was in a leather ase. VV. O.
Rhodes was the officer fired upon.
According to the complaining wit
nesses, the house where the prisoner
was arrested ha dbeen under surveill
ance during the eaiTy part ot l lies
day night, and it is alleged that sig
nals were flashed from the place to
the Mexican side of the line at inter
vals. There was also considerable
noise in the house, the soldiers said.
The soldiers, however, made no in
vestigation of the house until the
shot was fired.
Rhodes said he was standing at
an observation post, although in
plain view of the house, when the
report of the gun sounded. He im
mediately , fired twice in reply, and,
when others came to the .scene,
Rhodes and a mounted patrolman
had the house covered with their
rilles. The place was Immediately
surrounded and an officer and sol
dier went inside. Sandante denied
having heard the shot, and was em
phatic in his declaration that there:
were no firearms in the place. M'hen
the searchers came in 'lie at once
crawled into bed, saying through the
interpreter that had been secured
next door, that he had been asleep
since about 8 o'clock and still was
drownsy. The shot came from the
house about 1 o'clock.
When Captain Davis, who had
charge of the liorder patrol, reached
the house, he searched the bed and
found the rifle, case and belt of
shells hidden in the bed. Sandarite
was taken to Camp Harry J. Jones,
kept there until yesterday morning
and then turned over to the civil a-
! thorities. When he reached the io
i lice station Police Sergeant Hurry
Overlock asked him what he was do
' ing there, and he said that he had
been cleaning his gun and it accident
ally discharged a shell.
Sandante is a very dark tkinneri
Mexican and apparently is not evi .
burdened with intelligence. He was
clad in blue overalls, kept his lace
turned toward the floor duiiiig !i:s
hearing and showed little interest
in the proceedings. He made in.
plea in his own behalf. William
Faurr acted as interpreter and As
sistant Stephenscn conducted the
prosecution.

I GRAND OPERA STAR
HAD TO LEAVE STAGE
Mme. Mantelli Restored to
Health by Tanlac "I Can
not Praise It Too High
ly," She Says
. "1 feel that I cannot praise Tanlac
too highly, for it nas done me more
real good than all the other medicines
I have ever taken put together.
"About eight years ago," she con
tinued, "while traveling in the south
I left Havana for Chicago, in the dead
of winter, where the thermometer was
18 degrees below zero, and this was
the beginning of serious trouble for
me. The sudden change brought on
such a severe cold that I almost com
pletely lost my voice and was obliged I
to leave the stage. I went to Califor- j
nia to work in moving pictures, but j
my health failing, I had to give that ',
up too. I decided to rest a w hile, and I
try to build myself up, b utgot stead-'
ily worse. I lost my appetite, every-1
thing tasted alike, and 1 couldn't en-j
joy eating a thing. My kidneys were
in such a terrible condition that I !
thought at times the pain in my back j
would drive me distracted. My lower;
limbs and feet were so awfully swol-:
len I couldn't stand up at all, and my i
nerveB were in such a wretched state
that, with my kidneys worrying me
so much, I just couldn't rest at night.
I became so weak and rundown, and
was so discouraged and miserable that
I didn't care what happened.
"I was actually down in bed when
one day I read a statement about
Tanlac that impressed me so much !
that I just got up out of bed and went !
to the 'phone to order a bottle. Tlio ;
druggist couldn't send it at once so!
I asked a stranger passing through thej
hall to get it for me. Well, he did;
and by the next morning 1 was feel-'
ing much improved. After this my
nights were more restful and I slept
better than I had in some time. I
continued the treatment and it wasn't :
long before every bit of the swelling
had gone out of my limbs and feet,
and I was able to get up and walk I
about. I am just starting on my third
bottle now, and really, I can hardly
eat enough to satisfy my appetite and
I heartily enjoy all my meals. My
kidneys don't worry me at all now and
I am free from that awful misery in
my back. I sleep like a baby, and am
so much better in every way that I
am now working again. I am telling
all my friends what a wonderful medi
cine Tanlac is, and have written to
my daughter in New York advising
her to take it."

The school assembly, which was
held In the High school auditorium
yesterday morning at 11 o'clock, was
not only attended by the s;hool fac

tions. She was accompanied on the
piano by Mrs. W. Douglas, directress
of the musical department at the Bis

It is scarcely necessary to mention
the ability of Miss Wilson, whose ad

justice. The recitals in wheh she has

ers of the northwest end of the county
who now have no representative.

county will have no cause to regret It
if they select him to represent them in
the legislature. He is one of them,
and has secured what property he
I owns by the work of his hands and
i the sweat of his brow. There will be
; no needless expenditures allowed with
his consent in the lower house of the
