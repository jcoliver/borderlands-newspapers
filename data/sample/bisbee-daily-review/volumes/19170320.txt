Court's Decision in Case. !
(By Review Leased Wire)
NEW YORK, March 19 With
the nation-wide railroad strike
averted and the Adamson act de
clared constitutional, the contro
versy that has raged between the
railroads and their employes for
nearly a year over the question of
hours and wages passed into his
tory today.
Yield Through Loyalty.
, Appealed tj by the President's
mediators to yield on the grounds
of patriotism to the demands of
the employes, the railroads just
before daybreak today conceded
the eight hour basic work day and
pro rata, pay for overtime. te
same as that provided by the
Adamson law.
8-Hour Law Held Valid.
' ' Seveial hours later the t'nited
States supreme court upheld the
" ooimtilvitiojiiilUy of the Adamson
act and what the brotherhoods al
ready had obtained by their threat
to call a nation-wide strike at sev
en o'clock tonight, the supreme
court legally assured to them.
Back Pay for Men.
All that remains t'j decide is how
much back pay the employes are
entitled to. inasmuch as the agree
ment signed by both sides and the
Adamson act provide that the opera
tion of the new wage and hour sche
dule shall be retroactive beginning I
January 1. The brotherhoods and the
railroad managers will pet together on (
this matter tomorrow. It is estimated
the employes have between $12,000,000
and J13.000.000 coming to them.
Expect Long Harmony.
V. G. Lee. spokesman for the bro
therhoods, made it plain today that
he looked for peace in the railroad
world for a long time. Asked whether
there was any intention to bring, up
in the conferences tomorrow the oues-
tion of uunitive overtime. Mr. Lee ,
aj,. i
"That will not be brought up now. '
We believe that overtime can largely
be '.done away with by speeding up
the schedules." ,
Lane Praises R. R.
rTaniciin k. lane, secretary 01 uie
interior, in a statement expressing
the satisfaction of the mediation com-
m it tee over the outcome, praised the
railroad managers "for their liigh

ingness to permit any embarrassment

The President authorized the ex

the suspension of the eight hour labor

PHILADELPHIA, March 19.
Under cover of darkness seven
sailors of the German commerce
raiders Kronprinz Wilhelm and
Prinz Eit-I Frederich, interned at
he Philadelphia navy yard, made
an attempt to escape tonight, all
even being captured by marines
and police after shots were fired
at the fugitives.
A sentry on post near the raiders
heard several splashes in the back
channel and fired a warning shot
Prilir-n nn pnaril near the channel saw
four of the German sailors swimming
about fifty yards from the interned
vessels and discharged their revolvers
over their heads. The four Germans
turned and swam back, surrendering
wiinoui resistance,
Meantime, as a marine detachment
was rushed toward the back .channel,
three other German sailors slipped
into the meadows. Running along the
seawall to avoid the barbed wire bar
ricade partly encircling the internad
ships, they tried to slip past a sentry.
The sentry fired and ran toward the
little group. Mounted pJlice galloped
over the meadows and caught two of
the fleeing men. The other one was
found soon afterward hiding behind
a bush.

P,v Review Leased Wirel
WASHINGTON, March 19. In
an epochal decision holding con
gress to be clothed with any and
all power necessary to keep open
the channels of interstate com
merce, the supreme court today,
dividing five to four, sustained
the Adamson law as constitutional
and enforceable in every feature.
Legalizes 8:Hour Day.
The immediate effect of the decision
will be to fix a permanent eight-hour
basic day in computing wage scales
on interstate railroads, l'jr which a
nation-wide strike twfre has been
threatened and to give, effective from
January 1 of this year, increases in
wages to trainmen of about 25 per

White declared that the carriers and

Affects Public Rights.
"Whatever would be the right of
an employe engaged in private busi
ness to demand such wages as lie de
sires, to leave the employment if he
does not get them and by concert of
action to agree with others to leave
on the same conditions," said the
opinion, "such rights are necessarily
subject to limitation when employment
is acuated in a business charged with
public interest and as to which the
power to regulate commerce by cVn
gress is applied and the resulting
right to fix in case of disagreement

justice departed at this point from his

Coming on the heels of the conces

Submarining Without Warning of Vigilancia With Loss of
American Crew Is Unbearable Offense to U. S. Wilson and
Cabinet to Meei Today. Calling of Congress Is Believed
Matter of Hours.
(By Review Leased Wire)
WASHINGTON. Mar. 1 9. President Wilson is expected within the next 48 hours
to indicate definitely that he believes a virtual state of war exists between the Ur.ii-'d States
and Germany.
News received from Plymouth that 1 5 men, same of them Americans, had been drown
ed when the American merchantman Vigilancia was sunk without warning by a German
submarine, added, if possible, to the already grave view of the situation held here as a resuk
of the destruction of the Vigilancia, the Illinois and the City of Memphis.
Whether the President will hasten the extra session of congress, already cr.lied for
April 16, or will take additional steps to protect American commerce without this move,
was not disclosed tonight. No official pretended to know his plans, and the general view
was that he was still considering the question in his usual deliberate way.
A cabinet meeting probably will be held tomorrow afternoon and at that time the
new situation arising out of the aggression of Germany is expected to be thoroughly
convassed.
Prepares For Aggressive Action
Preparation for aggressive action to protect' American rights began today when the
President personally visited the navy department and directed Secretary Daniels to utiKre
the $1 15.000.000 made available by congress to hasten naval building pfens.
Early graduation of two classes at Annapolis and the mobilization of reserves will
make it possible to man quickly all ships of the navy.
Co-Operate With Allies At Sea
The question was also taken up of getting into communication informally with
Great Britain and France to discuss co-operation in the protection of commerce lanes.
This step probably will not be taken until the course of the United States has hern f.r.a'ly
-determined.
The President likewise saw Secretaries Lansing and McAdoo, and William Derma::,
chairman of the federal shipping board and there was every indication tliat he was map
ping out comprehensive plans for the protection of American interests in any eventual, y.
Think State of War Already On
It is generally concedd that already a virtual state of war exists with Germany in spite
of the technical armed neutrality status of the United States. A suggestion advanced to
night was that the President might issue a ctill for congress to meet within ten days and In
his proclamation point out the new situation the nation since he asked for authonty to
establish a state of armed neutrality. No one professed, however, to be in the Presidents
confidence.

ELECTION FRAUDS.
Much wailing and gnashing of teeth is heard from the
Hunt side of the gubernatorial controversy over the fact
that fraud has been uncovered in the workings of the.
e'ection board of Precinct Number 1. Douglas. The
attorneys for the former governor and his friends lo.se
eight of the facts in their wild scramble and hope that
the former 'white' hope will again be able to place hi.i
corpulence behind a nice desk, in a nice office in a well
appointed buildings and again draw a monthly stipend
from the people of the state of Arizout.
Losing sight, entirely, of the fact that gross fraud has
been perpetuated, counsel for the former governor is
endeavoring to make a blaek shirt appear spotlessly
white. Whitewash is the product of older days, but it
I.as not lost its usefulness when vote theft and felony
is concerned yea, even in this most progressive of states
and forward of counties.
Many overlook the obvious fact that the fight in Pre
cinct Number 1, Douglas, was not over the governorship.
It was between Clyde Braiium and R. T. Dunlap for jus
tice of the peace. Henchmen of the former were in con
trol of the Number 1 polling place. They, undoubtedly,
changed many straight Republican ballots to Deniocra'ic
votes in a hope that P.ranum would overcome his cp
ponent's lead. No one, least of all the supporters of
Clyde Branuni and George W. P. Hunt, suspected that
Tom Campbell had the slightest chance of election. The
election of the governor did not worry the board of
Douglas Number 1. Nevertheless the acts of H. H. Hart
and Art Pearson are exceedingly reprehensible.
When supporters of the former executive maintain that
Pearson is bein;? held outside the state by attorneys fcr
Campbell, they are attempting to either make fools of
sane people or are deliberately attempting to falsify their
idol into another term. They overlook the obvious ia
searching for some straw which might be turned in a
vain hope that efforts to eliminate fraud will work for
the benefit of their champion.
Whether or not Judge Standiford, in the superior
court of Maricopa county, eliminates Douglas 1 from the
gubernatorial contest is of small moment when the tam
pering with votes on a large scale, and in such a flagrant
manner is to be considered.
County Attorney Rose and his assistant take the right
and proper view of the situation. They do not take the
position that it is reprehensible for one party's ad
herents and not for the other. They .have come out.
openly, with the declaration that fraud from any j-arty
will be prosecuted and ilie spring will, undoubtedly, wit
ness some interesting developments in this line .
In the meantime it would be entirely fitting for those
people who are supporting the f'.rmer governor to look
well before they leap eithel into print or into the t-w
of puiic opinion. Tie voters oi .xri.ona and of Cocnise
county are excee tin j jealous of '.heir right3 wh. n in a
polling booth and when fraud has been either practiced
cr attempted they may be expected to domain that it
be exposed or punished. It does not matter, now or ir.
the future, whether one side or another is guilty. It
should be put under the ban of the law.
respect and that of his fellow citizens, would experieuee
a very uncomfortable feeling were he a party to it.
The publicity given to this case reierreil to has been
so great that it can scarcely be hoped that it will net
come to the attention of the department of justice, which
takes a very much greater interest in maintaining the
purity of state elections where federal candidates are
up for the suffrages of the people than it does in the
election of a justice of the peace or even that of a gov
ernor or of protecting the wagers which may have been;
laid on any local candidate.
GERMAN LETTERS.
Among Germany's minor troubles, there is a bitter con
troversy raging among the German people regarding the
abolition of the Gothic letters in favor of the Romrn
characters now used in nearly all other nations. The
Roman type has made considerable headway in Germany
in recent years, particularly in the printing of scientific
works intended for circulation throughout the world.
But newspapers and periodicals still held to the old
Gothic, and the people use it almosT universally.
The Kaiser has long been a defender of the old type,
preferring it as he prefers so many medieval things, on
the ground that it helps preserve the Germans as a dis
tinct and peculiar people.
This very argument is now uses' against the Gothic let
ters. It is argred that they are responsible for mui'a
misunderstanding cf Germany throughout the worll.
The Ilerlia Tagebh-tt explains that foreigners would un
derstand and sympathize with Germany if they could only
read German literature; butl'ney are deterred from learn
ing because it is necessary, at the start, to learn a new
alphabet.
The letters, mor-ovcr. are criticized as hard on the
eyes, thereby mak'ng reading unnecessarily difficult a
true accusation, as most people will agree. The monks
of the middle ages who evolved the Gothic characters
were ct.pcrrned far more with the decorative effects ol
their manuscripts than with their legibility.
The change to rimple Roman would no doubt be an
excellent thing. But it might not prove so effective as it
adv.. rates think. Something more than plainer print is
needed to make pr.ent-day Germany intelligible to the
outer world.
, WHOSE OIL?
It may be that the people cf the I'nittd States are en
gaged in a curious business transaction. It looks as if j
ll.ey were buying oil that already belongs to them.
The Government has reserved for future use various
oil lands, particularly in California. In territory adjacent
to the grvernment reservations, private dealers hav
sunk wells and are pumping oil. The question is, where
does the oil come from that flows into the privately owned
v.el'.s? It's ejuite pcssibla that all. knowing po territorial
restrictions, flows through underground channels from
the government lauds into the neighboring, reservoirs.
And when Uncle Sain wants it there may be none left.
But what can I'ncle do about it. Many a private citizen
has had his oil or fas drained oi? in the same way.
HAVE FEDERAL STATUTES BEEN VIOLATED?
Wonder if it has ever occurred to the individual w In
dividuals who think it a good joke to tamper witb-bal! .ts
for the benefit of a friend, that the government holds v
as a very serious crime to tamper in any way with an
election or with the ballots cast at an election where
federal candidates are on the ticket to 1m- voted for?
I'.ven though the interference may not seriont ly affect
the particular eases of federal candidates, the tampera?
with the ballots containing tjieir names is held to In
very serious offense, ami punishable by line ;md imu"i'-:.-nient.
The fate of a iiite. large coterie .l politicians in Terre
Haute, Ind., who were sent to various terms of imphsor
ment for, just such pravti e s, must yet be- fresh in the
minds of newspaper readers.
A ease has recently developed iii this state, which

PRODUCTIVE EXPENDITURES
Congress fortunately has not been too much engrossed
with war problems to ignore domestic development en-
r
tirely. In the closing days of the session it has appro
priated $45,000,000 to deepen the channel and prevent
floods on the Mississippi, and $5,000,000 for similar work
on the Sacramento in California. The money is to be
spent over a period of several years.
It is unfair to designate such appropriations as "pork,"
just as it is unfair to apply that invidious term to ati ap
propriation for deepening the East River' channel in New
York harbor to make the Brooklyn navy yard available
tor the largest warships. Our internal waterways sys
tem, like our system of highways, is in need of f; r more
consideration and "far greater expenditures than it has
ever received, if the nation's economic life is to be fos
tered and its transportation possibilities fully realized.
The amount of money expended is a relatively unim
portant matter. What counts is that the funds should be
expended wisely, in tie carrying out of a deliberate ane
comprehensive plan.
If we get into war, we shall no doubt spend several
billions of dollars iu unproductive activities. We aiv
really eoiug to spend billions merely for defensive pur
poses, whether we have war or not. Whenever a military
emergency appears, the nation t). K.'s huge budgets with
a hurrah. WJiy should there be so much opposition to
every proposal for spending far smaller sums to creative,
constructive work for the utilization of our natural resources?

Frit lied Gannon's famous dog

Take all the colors of the rainbow
and slam them together and one has

Yesterday's opeuing displays of

The effect is simply staggering.
Vet brilliant as the colors are, they
are entirely pleasing to the eye. and
more in harmony with the coming of
spring than in recent years.
in these colors one has the buddin1
rose, the sprouting twig, the blue
grass of Kentucky, the deep green of
the sea, and combinations of color so
dariiig that even the futurist painter's
gaudy mixtures look drab in compari

CHICAGO CRAINS
CHICAGO. Mar. 19. Decided ad
vances today in tne value or wneat
followed the railroad strike settle
ment and the supreme couit decision
that the Adamson 8-hour law is con
stitutional. Prices closed strong 24
to 4, net higher with May at 1.88
and July 1.5S' to 1.59. Corn gained
'm to 3 cents, oats ?i to ; and pro
visions 27 to 115.
At first the wheat market made on
ly moderate upturns in response to
advices that the threatened walkout
of railroad employes had been declar
ed off. '
One of the factors which in the last
hour lifted the wheat market to the
highest level of the day was an un
confirmed rumor of serious disturb
ances in Germany. Corn advanced to
new high price records. Seaboard
buying and active demand from indus
tries were strongly in evidence and

'MRS. RUTH SARGENT
MISS MYRTLE ARBON
MISS CADDIE CLIFFORD
Entertainment De Luxe Will Mark the End of Arizona's
Greatest Subscription Contest
First of all, the Contest Editor wishes to apoligize, for not having published the portraits of Miss Emmabelle Rolfe
and Miss Katie Johns i nthis page. Both of them are of The Review's strongest candidates but the cuts have been mis
placed and up to the hour of going to press we were unable to locate tnem.
The Review, through the co-operation of the Copper Queen Band and manager A. B. Richardson of the Y. M. C. A.,
has arranged a programe of par excellence to conclude the Greater Automobile and Prize Contest next Saturday night, and
the entertainment will be free to all who can crowd inside the doors of the Y. M. C. A.
At 7:30 P. M. next Saturday the three prize cars, the Chandler-Six, the Siudebaker and ihe Chevrolet will be parked
at the Postoffice square and will be allowed to remain there until 8 o'clock. At 7:30 the Copper Queen Band will assemble
around the prize cars and several selections will be played. At 8:00 the band will proceed on perade up as far as the Bisbee
Auto Company followed by the prize machines, retreating their steps and escorting the cars to the Y. M. C. A., by way of the
Orpheum Theater up Brewery Gulch and back again past the Copper Queen Hotel to the Bib Y building.
'V
At 8:30 P. M. the contest shall be declared closed by the judges who have so courteously volunteered their services
incounting the votes and declaring the winners. The ballot box will then be opened, and the verifyig of the last weks sub
scriptions and the counting of all the votes will begin.
During th counting of the votes members of the Y. M. C. A. will entertain you with one of the best local programmes
ever scheduled in this city, both athletics and musical.
The judges who have so kindly offered to volunteer their services to count the votes and decide the winners, are: H. S.
Hooper, Manager Furniture and House Furnishing Department, Phelps, Dodge Co., J. L. Silverthorn, Advertising Man
ager of The Fair Store; I. F. Burgess, Assistant Cashier, Miners and Merchant Bank; J. W. Klein, Assistant Cashier, Bank
of Bisbee; O. W. Wolf, Citizens Bank and Trust Co., Assistant Cashier.
Now, Miss Candidate, the eyes of all the Warren District are on you. They do not know who will win, but they expect
their respective favorites to make a real good showing. This is the week that you will be given credit for being a loyal candi
date if you are noticed gathering subscriptions.
Visit every home in the district that you can ; visit all the boarding houses where readers of the Review c?n readily
be found for the asking. Plead with them to renew their subscriptions in your favor, and among the many who you visit
you will find many new subscribers.
It is the last opportunity that you will ever be given to have three big chances to win a car. There are seventeen com
petitors who are going to endeavor to win a car. There are seventeen competitors who are going to endeavor to accomplish
final victory, but what of it the more the merrier, and even if all plug hard you have at least one chance in six lo get one
of the cars, not like a drawing where you get one chance in fifty, thousand.
The race up until last Saturday was extremely close and what you do this week will decide whether or not ycu will be
one of the three automobile winners. Don't run away with the idea that you have enough votes to win, and that anyone
of the eighteen candidates are already beaten, or you will be beating yourself. All have an equal chance and it depends on
the biggest gains this week for final victory.

Rules and Conditions Which Govern the Close of the Review's
Contest Next Saturday Night
Following are the rules and regulations for the close of the Bisbee Daily Review's Greater Automobile and Prize Con
test, Saturday night, March 24th, and such rule? and regulations as herein outlined must be slrictly adhered to.
The ballot box which is now in the custody of the Bank cf Bisbee will remain there for safa keeping until, 7:30 P. M.
next Saturday at which time it will be brought to the lobby of the Y. M. C. A.
The ssal of the slot only will be broken and the candiddter will be allowed to deposit all the subscriptions they have
received this week.
Each subscription must be listed on the order sheet suoplfcd you by the contest editor, one subscription to each lin-.,
giving the name, full and explicit address, number of months ca .years, and the amount. In crder to signify whether tVe
subscription is new or old, the amount must be written in the rew or old column as the case may be.
Candidates are warned to be careful in filling in the amount in the correct column, as ea;h subscription will be thor
oughly verified whether it is new or old before the votes for such subscription will be awarded. Leave the vote column
blank to be filled in by the judges. No subscription must be for less than thr?e months nor for more than two years.
After listing all your subscriptions on the sheet total the amount of money the same tomes to. If necessary to use
rrore than one sheet, total each sheet separately. Then place the correct amount of money in an envelope together with
the sheets and such amount must be either in cash, currency or money order. If you take any checks have them made out to
you personally and cash the same.
Thareal your envelope and drop it into the box during the last hour of the contest between 7:30 and 8:30 P. M. " At
8:30 P. M. the chosen judges will declare the contest closed, and will immediately set about to count the votes and declare
the winners.
In addition to each candidates final weeks subscriptions all the votes secured during the congest will also be found in the
box by the judges for final counting. (
Candidates are warned to keep their total week's work to themselves, as even the contest manager has made it impos
sible for himself to know what any candidate accomplishes duri- g this week, thus making it impossible to give the slightest
opinion as to who the probable wnner will be. The sealed bailee box has been introduced for your special benefit, so that
your final weeks work will be deposited with absolute secrecy 'o yourself. In this respect the Review does it's share and
c::pccts you to do ycurs. At least the burden of responsibility for secrecy rests with you.
The prizes will be awarded according to the merits of each, based cn the number of vote cast for each. The candi
date polling the highest vote will be awarded the handsome $1 5 45.00 Chandler-Six Touring Ca; the Second highest candi
date will be awarded the seven passenger and reversible front scat Siudcbakcr Touring Car; the third highest gets the high
powered Chevrolet Touring Car. The next seven will be awarded the gold wrist watches and diamond lavalhercs in the
order of their choice.
rhe touring cars will be parked in front of the Y. M. C. A. a )d together with the othf- v.:: :s v-'Pl be awiudcd on the
s,ot.

the work of unloading and setting up
this mammoth Organization started in
the early morning and by live o'clock!
everything was in readiness for the
big opening al 7:30 Monday night
The event was characterized by the
representation for the first time of the
Arabian Nights, a unique entertain
ment consisting of seemingly impos
sible feats of magic, gun spinners,
and Oriental dancers, headed by
Princess Rajah. Then there is the
wild beast show where numerous
groups of trained but unturned animals
are put through e'jlutions by their
respective trainers, and tt is here one
will see Capt. Allan King, the young
est trainer, a graduate of the Hagen
beck school in Germany, with his per
forming liens, tigers and pumas, also
Senorita Elenore, the world's greatest
lady trainer will enter the steel bound,
arena and execute a dance of marvel
lous grace and skill, among genuine
forest bred African and Nubian lions.
Then at Neptunes Daughter, one will
see shapely mermaids, perform stunts
under, over and on the water that bor
der on the marvellous. The Miracle,
Honey Moon Trail, Top O' World and
other attractions too numerous to men
tion in a single article did a tre
mendous business, as did the Whip,
that new riding devise, and the ever
popular Merry G'j Round and Ferris
Wheel were well patronized by the
happy throngs of men, women and
children.
! The shows are much larger, and
cover more territory than when last
seen here and the manager, Mr. Fred
Becktnann, deserves 'a great deal of
credit for the genera! appearance and
merit of the attractions, all of which
are exceptionally clean and run by
showmen of the better class.
