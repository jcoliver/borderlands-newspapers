CHAUMONT, Dec, 25 (By the Associated Press).
President Wilson received a most cordial welcome today from
the people of Chaumont, a town which has been closely associ
ated with the history of the American expeditionary forces in
' France and is now the headquarters of the commander-in-chief.
It is the town from which America's part in finishing
the war was directed.
The presidential train, which left Paris at midnight, drew
into the Chaumont station at 9 o'clock this morning. Gen
eral Pershing, General Wirbel, the French officer command
ing the zone, M. Fossien, prefect of the department of the
Marne, and M. Levy-Alphandery, mayor of Chaumont, were
on the platform to receive the president and Mrs. Wilson, who
after responding to the cordial greetings, passed through a
salon- hung with red tapestries and flags to the court yard,
where a company of the 109th French infantry and a com
pany of the 102nd American infantry were drawn up to
render honors.
The exterior of the station and the
courtyard had been decorated for the Tl I If III A Tl All III"
occasion by American soldiers with'TI f$U I II 11? III

er passing the guard of honor in re
view, the president took his place in
a motor car and the party proceeded
to the city hall. Dense crowds massed
behind the lines of guards in khaki;
the streets were brilliantly decorated
and hung with banners bearing in
scriptions of welcome.
President is Acclaimed
As the party passed through, the
people of Chaumont joined in a con
tinuous acclamation of the president.
All this part of France lay -under a
gray cloud and banks of drizzling cold
rain when the president's train pulled
into the station. The troops declared
the weather was exceptionally fine, as
compared with the usual brand of
weather and every one bad a broad
smile beaming above his mud-bespattered
khaki uniform.

However, in View of British
Journalist, This Does Not
Mean That Reporters Will
Attend Meetings
MANCHESTER, England, Tuesday,
Dec. 24. "When we speak of eliminat
ing secrecy, we do not, of course,
mean that reporters should attend the
peace conference, but that, though
the discussions are private the results
should be published, and that not at
the close of the negotiations but
throughout them."
This view was expressed today by
C. Scott, editor of the Manchester
Guardian, in a talk with the Associat
ed Press on the question of secrecy
at the peace conference.
"Naturally there are drawbacks,"
continued the Guardian's editor. "Del
icate matters, involving special na
tional interests and national pride,
may in some ways be more difficult
of adjustment when made the sub
ject of public controversy, but on the
other hand, the only means of bring
ing effective pressure to bear in the
general interests against particular
interests is by publicity.
"Doubtless public discussion would
need to be conducted with restraint
and under a sense of responsibility
and with unbroken friendliness. That
would be the duty of the public every
where, who would then become in a
real sense parties to a negotiation in
which the interests of all are In
volved. . It would be the duty of the
newspapers, so powerful in this mat
ter, to assist. But the fundamental
reason for breaking with the old tra
dition of secrecy arises out of the
very conception and the primary ob
ject of the conference.
"The conference, Is, or ought to be,
the coming together of the nations in
the world in the common interest of
the world and for the attainment of
objects In which all are equally con
cerned. As long as this motive and
object are dominant there Is no reason
for secrecy. Publicity is the surest
mfcans of keeping them dominant.
"As President Wilson well said, the
international relation we now seek to
establish is the relation of under-
l standing and of friendship. We had
better begin as we Intend to go on."

were warnings to the public both from

of the necessity for strict economy
and against worthless securities. The
committee stated its intention to
make a supplementary report to con

Technical Experts Studying
Questions Bearing on the
Rights of Claimants to Par
ticipate PARIS, Dec. 23, tBr Ve Associated
Press.) More than three weeks prob
ably will elapse before the general
peace conference assembles. It is un
likely that any official statement will
be issued in the meantime concerning
the number of governments to be rep
resented or the tests to be applied to
determine the right of applicants to
participate.
Technical experts attached to the
delegation of the principal powers kl
ready have given much study to this
subject. If negotiations to reach an
agreement on this point have not been
undertaken already it is certain they
will be immediately after President
Wilson's return from London.
Notwithstanding the indisposition
of the British government to inject
business into Mr. Wilson's visit, it is
possible that in his conferences with
Premier Lloyd George and Foreign
Minister Balfour the foundation may
be laid for settlement of the question
of representation which Mr. Wilson
probably has discussed with Premier
Clemenceau.
Conditions which will confront the
neace conference when it opens will
i not be unlike those marking the op
! ening of a new congress in the Unite
I States or a national convention. In
the first the bouse clerk determines
the tentative membership and in the
second the committee on credentials
prepares a tentative list of delegates.

ARTICLE

Dr. Hyman L. Goldstein
Writes Important Message
on the Disease, Its Treat
ment and Immunization
i'AMOUS RHEIMS CATHEDRAL. BATTERED BY GERMAN FIRE,
LOOKS DOWN ON VICTORIOUS FRENCH SOLDIERS BEING HONORED
Kyman L. Goldstein. M. D. a cele
brated physician of New Jersey, bu
written a most vital article regarding
treatment for prevention of influenza
in the last issue of the Medical Coun
cil, which is important to every one
at this time. In this article he deals
with the practical side of immuniza
tion from the dread disen te by means
of vaccine. k Thjs part of his article
is reproduced here as follows: ,
Immunization.
"Those exposed to infection, cr in
danger of being exposed, and all mem
bers of families where a case of thic
epidemic influenza is already exist
ing, should be inoculated and im
munized with combined influenza vac
sine in fairly larse doses. , There is
now little doubt as to the great pro
phylactic value of properly and fresh
ly prepared combined influenza vac
cine vaccine containing B. influenzae,
micrococcus catarrhalis, pneumococci,
streptococc and stnhylococci and prob
ably also B. friedlander. llany hun
dreds of employes of the Hell Tele
phone company of Pennsylvania were
immunized with the mixed vaccine
and most eneouraeing were the :e
sulis. From all over the country most
satisfactory results were ob'a'ned
from the prophylactic use of ihes?
accines. Very few of those persons
ear:y and properly inoculated devel
oped the disease. Even the few who
were immunized and then taken down
with the disease, did not hfcvo a se-ve.-e
attack and were quite free of
complications. In my own experi
ence, only two or three developed
slight symptoms of the disease, ar.d
they promptly recovered out of a
fairly larpe number that incc
u'ated for prophylactic purposes.
"Dr. Solomon Solis Colin bei:ves
that the mixed bacerins (vaccines)
are as valuable and efficient in the
treatment and prophylaxis of influ
enza and its complications as mer
cury in syphilis and quinine in ma
laria. "Dr. William E- Robertson has even
used the mixed vaccines in hundreds
of cases, intravenously, with most
wonderful results, i:i the treatment of
the disease and its complications.

contributed so liberally in order to
nake Christmas happier for the poor

j mas baskets for 20 families whose
i names were furnished them by Miss
Cuiuium.s, general secretary of the
relief association, while the churches
supplied provisions, clothing and oth

as well as many toys. The Presbyter
ian church gave a liberal donation of
money for the Christmas work, all
of which has been gratefully received
and will be used to good advantage
among the poor families and children.
All of these families were worthy of

Allan S. Bliem of the Copper Queen
hotel has received word of the death
of his father. Frank H. Bleim, at the
age of 74 years at the home of his
daughter, Mrs. Kate Stein, Pottstown,
Pa. The news came as much of a
shock to the son in this city, not
withstanding his father had suffered
recent ill health and had reached an
age at which much might not be ex
pected from hi recuperative powers.
An attack of influenza two months ago
left behind an affection of the heart,
which was the ultimate cause of
death.
The deceased was of the sturdy type
of Pennsylvania farmer to whose loy
alty, integrity and unceasing industry
so much of the country owes advance
ment, both by reason of example set
and community wealth made available
for development everywhere and in
all lines of activity. His wife passed
to the beyond some years ago. Ten
children of a family of thirteen sur-J
vive him. A son and a daughter are
in France, the one in the military
service and- the other in the Red
Cross. Other sons have been in mil
itary camps in this country.
' Allan S. Bleim's longt connection
with the Copper Queen hotel has
given him wide acquaintance and
esteem with the public of the district
and the traveling public of the state,
among whom bis many friends will
extend much sympathy to him in his
bereavement.

Sunday evening.
Stub trains are being operated from
Tucumcari, N. M., to provide for the

THE AMERICAN TERMS
(Boston Transcript.)
Not yet has the peace conference as
sembled in Paris, but the chaff is neverthe
less in active process of being sifted out
of the various peace propositions. For this
reason, it is not surprising to see public
attention at the French capital centering
itself on the terms clearly outlined by Sen
ator Lodge, in his speech before the senate
on August 23 last. Mr. Laurence Hills- the
correspondent of the New York Sun with
the Wilson party, cables from Paris that
attention is now focused upon the princi
ples enunciated by Mr. Lodge, not only be
cause they are in agreement with the neces
sities of the case, but because they repre
sent the view which will be dominant in the
United States senate when it devolves upon
that body to ratify the treaty of peace. The
United States, it is needless to say, can
never be a participant in a treaty which is
not approved by two-thirds of the senate.
And a3 peace is bound to be made, it will
be made without the participation of the
United States if the agreement reached is
not satisfactory to that two-thirds major
ity. In other words, all formal American
participation in the peace conference is vain
unless in its terms it is satisfactory to the
senate. It is natural, therefore, since this
condition is well known abroad, that the
Lodge terms should center public attention
in Paris at the present time, especially as
there is great satisfaction with their sub
stantial agreement with the necessary de
mands of Great Britain, France- Italy and
Belgium.
Surely our European associates in the
war are in hearty agreement with Senator
Lodge's declaration that there must be com
pensationjor the ravage of the war, and
trjat "ourjpart and our business is to put
Germany in a position where she can do
no more harm in the future to the rest of
the world." "Unless we advise this," said
the senior senator from Massachusetts, ' we
shall have fought in vain; congress and
the president had no. right to declare war
unless they meant to do precisely this
thing; nothing less than this would justify
our action." The clearness of such an ut
terance as this appeals strongly to the logi
cal French mind; the words, moreover,
meet the French nation's demand. The
satisfaction of this demand, under Senator
Lodge's principles, stands in front pf all
leagues of nations or other arrangements
of the future. 'When Germany is beaten
. to her knees andthe world is made safe by
the arrangement which I have suggested,"
the senator said, "then, and not before, we
shall have the just and righteous peace for
which we fought."
Here is an American platform on which
Entente Europe is ready to stand, and it is
becoming evident that it is unwilling to
stand on any other.
PRICES" WILL COME DOWN
(Florida Tinies-Union.)
No matter how great the effort to keep
people from expecting a drop in general
commodity prices the drop will come, this
being the verdict of experts in business and
finance, and the prediction being founded
on facts and precedent. Much has been
sr.id and written on the subject and it is
generally understood that the protest made
against a decline is in the interest of trade
generally, in an effort to keep the public
mind content with the artificial, unusual
conditions prevailing. Precedent and prac
tically unfailing signs point to a steady
drop however, along general lines, and
within a reasonable period things will reach
something nearly normal.
Close buyers at wholesale are already
noting a change in the markets and within
a very short time the retail buyers must
notice the result. The strain is off; the
country, which has been buying and selling
almost without argument, has returned to
ordinary methods of examination, offer and
acceptance or refusal. There are no more
"blanket orders" without inquiry as to
cost and time of delivery. The markets of
the world are open once more and other
lands are bidding for business with pros
pects of delivery and satisfaction.
With the readjustment of prices on com
modities, wages also will suffer some
changes, and all of this is feared by some
who are ready to predict a business panic
with numerous failures and much distress.
But precedent does not indicate such condi
tions as suggested. From the" records it is
proved that with the general and rapid re
duction in prices that followed the conclus
ion of the war between the states there was
no panic. Business had anticipated the in
evitable. Merchants bought close and car
ried small stocks. There were but few
failures in 1865 although there had been
thousands of bankruptcies in 1861.
With the world market open and ten mil
lion men returned from unusual to ordinary
pursuits and occupations, commodities
must go down, and trad, understanding
this, will protect itself and only the careless
or indifferent will suffer.
AUDIT THE BOOKS
. (Verde Copper News.)
Governor Campbell has announced that
one of the first official acts will be to recom
mend a complete audit of the state books
a small matter that seems to have escaped
the notice of former Governor Hunt in
the press of prison reform, writing letters
to "Dear Mike" and having his picture
taken in the embrace of his wobbly friends.
The state at large will approve this stand
by Governor Campbell and will insist that
the audits be made by competent officials
so that we may, for the first time since
statehood, have an idea of where we stand.
The worst feature of our present system
or lack of system is that any state official-
no matter what his department, may
and does spend more money than the ap
propriation bills call for and that the over
plus of expenditure is simply charged to
the general account and that is, the end of
the matter. '
This is a beautiful system for the of
fice holders but a sorry one for the tax
payers, and it must of necessity lead to ex
travagance in the expenditure of public
moneys, if not to something worse.
So far as personal honesty is concerned,
it is not to be expected that an audit of the
books will disclose any actual stealing on
the part of the heads of state departments,
but it is well nigh certain that a degree of
carelessness and extravagance will be
found that is almost as bad as direct thiev
ery could possibly be.
What business man would entrust his
employes with the right to spend unlimited
amounts out of the store till? How long
would a 'business last that was conducted
along such lines? And yet that is just what
our servants at Phoenix have been doing.
The legislature provided certain moneys
for the expenses of each department and
the supposition was that the heads of such
departments would keep their expenditures
within the limits prescribed but these sup
positions were never realized. The state
officials spent whatever, in their judgment,
was necessary to spend and were able to
charge the deficits to the handy and all
embracing "general account."
It is high time that Arizona got on a
business basis and the friends of Governor
Campbell hope that he will put it there.
Shades of the Hbhenzollerns, American
troops to take excurisons on the Rhine
river steamers in December Nineteen-Eigh-teen.
It seems only a few months since
German statesmen were declaring solemn
Ty they would hold out another winter and
defeat the "savages" arrayed against them.
The German children are very friendly
with the American soldiers and follow them
about just like the little ones in France do.
This is in sharp contrast to the attitude of
the Belgian and French children toward
the Hun soldiers. It does not take a child
long to tell the difference between kind
men and brutes.
The two-cent postage rate will be re
established on July 1 , next, and after that
there will be no excuse for anyone to keep
letters unanswered.

Asked about the white book which
Carl Kautsky is said to be preparing
in Berlin, Count von Bernstorff said:
"I don't think the book will reveal
the individual responsibility of the

It will rather show the collective
faults of the regime.

that the review and land parade to
morrow will so down in history as the
greatest spectacle of its kind ibis half
of the world has ever known.
Arizona Leads Parade
When the long column ot fighting
ships, led by the Arizona, enters the
narrows tomorrow morning and moves
to the anchorage berths in the Hud
son, it will be escorted- by an aerial
fleet of 21 seaplanes and two dirigi
bles from the naval air station at
Rockaway.
Besides these aircraft, the fleet will
be accompanied by three kite balloons.
One towed by the Gloucester, and fly
ing at a height of 800 feet, will move
nearly a mile ahead of the Arizona,
while behind the Florida, the last ship
In line, will be towed the other two.
Whistles Are Ready
Every factory whistle for miles
around has received a final Inspection,
so that they should not fail to speak
their welcome. It is expected that not
a square foot of soil on the heights
of Brooklyn or Staten Island will be
vacant while millions will throng both
banks of the Hudson to hail the re
turning ships as they come to anchor.
At New York the overseas fleet will
find awaiting to greet it great battle
ships of the home fleet and many
swift destroyers which have been do
ing convoy and patrol duty in Amer
ican waters during the war. . This
home fleet is tonight anchored in the
Hudson.
Reviewing Party Stationed
At the Statue of Liberty, to the west
of the main channel, will be stationed
the presidential yacht Mayflower, car
rying Secretary Daniels, who arrived
here tonight from Washington for the
review. Aboard will be other members

cers ot high rank and other distin
guished guests.
Behind the Mayflower will be anch

The Arizoua will rea,ch the May

to an official announcement tonight
by Vice-Admiral Grant. As each vessel
passes the secretary's ship, it will fire
19 guns in Mr. Daniels' honor and the
Mayflower will roar its reply.

HOOVER SENDS REPORT
ASKING TO HAVE SUP
PLIES INCREASED, NOW
(Continued from Page One)
and residential destruction in Belgium
varies greatly in different localities,
and with different industries. For In
stance, out of the 50 steel furnaces in
Belgium 35 or 40 have been deliber
ately destroyed by the eGrmang in
their determination to end the Bel
gian steel industry. Many of the
textile mills have been put out of com
missoin, either through deliberate de
struction and removal of machinery,
or by removal of the copper and brass
parts and electric motors. Some of
the textile mills of the more anti
quated type of equipment apparently
did not appeal to the Germans and
they can be gotten into action at an
early date. The Germans seem to
have focussed themselves on the mod
ern equipments.
- "The glass industry has been but
little Interfered with and the stern
promise of retribution by President
Wilson seems to have saved the coal
industry except for very few mines,
although actual explosives and wires
were laid in place tor the destruction
of a large number of the mines. The
presdent's warning seems to have
created a sudden change of heart.
Many French Refugees.
"There are some 300,000 French
refugees In Belgium, driven out ot
northern France by the Germans.
They have been cared for out of the
meager stores of the Belgians and by
the commission for relief in Belgium.
They are, however, like homing
pigeons in their resolve to return to
their native villages. As there is not
tranjportation, the roads southward
into France are a continuous stream
of these pitiful groups of men, women
and children, pulling their carts and
trudging through the cold and wind
toward their destroyed homes. Every
thing is being done that is humanly
possible, but in the present state of
demoralization, with moving armies,
the necessity of using every truck and
horse with which to feed the popula
tion, their plight is heartbreaking.
They refuse all persuasion to wait in
the crowded Belgian villages tmtil
their affairs can be organized.

"Star Spangled Banner" played by the
ship's baud.
Reception by Daniels
The Mayflower will then anchor at
the foot of 92d street and Secretary
Daniels will receive Admiral Mayo
and the commanding officers of the
various ships, who will come along
side in their launches.
Meanwhile contingents from each
ship ot the overseas fleet, numbering
10,000 men in all. will debark for
New York's first post-war parade.
Through streets gayly decorated with
flags and bunting, the sailors will
proceed along Broadway to 59th
street, acauss the Fifth avenue and
march down that historic thorough
fare under the arch of Victory at
Madison Square. At 2od street, the
column will turn toward the Hudson
river, embarking for the various ships.

At dusk each ship will be outlined
brilliantly with strings of electric
lights. Every turret, heavy gun and

"The Belgian government is rapidly

ers are engaged everywhere in the re

materials are available, and the spirit
of Belgium was never better than
today. The Belgians are resolved to
find a solution of their manifold diffi

possible from the outside. They are.
of course, dependent upon continued
government financial advances for tha
provision, of imports pending German
indemnity, and the reconstruction of
their export business."

SOME LITTLE HATERS
THOSE BOGHES WHILE
WAR WAS GOING GOOD
IX5NDOX, Dec. 10. (Correspond
ence of the Associated Press.) Fi ali
ments obtained of the latest output ol
Cerman songs and poems of the 'var
arc shown through and livid, as were
tli:ir forerunner-;, with hate.
"Now burn, O hate, flame forth!
For we have loved too long,
Hate is no sin, or if it is,
God pardon us the wrong."
This is the beginning cf a piece of
verse whose kinship to the notorious
"Hymn of Hate" is evident. Then fol
lows a catalogue of the allies' sins,
the foremost of which is "consorting
with yellow Asiatics." The final aut
burst runs:
"So burn, O hate, flame forth!
Burn even in death's house.
If ever hate should prove a sin.
Sin be God's law to us."
The writer signs himself "Michael,"
but one Dernhard Konig who styles
himself "King Boar-heart," outdoes
him. He indites a long poem telling
Germany that when her "Virgin
Sword" had struck down her base and
envious detractors, she would be call
ed on to execute justice, without
abatement cr mercy. Thus:
"Then hurl at him jour scorn, the
hateful hypocrite, the master liar;
hurl it in his face that grins with
pride. Drive him out there is no room

face of Europe cannot endure such a
disfigurement. A kick for this rabble
which, a prey to folly, has presumed
to cross swords with Germany."
There are nine stanzas of that.
Not very different is the voice of
one P. T. Steicher. who grows lyrical
th hatred of
Prayer.
"O, Lord," intones another, "we
worHhip thy might, we worship Thee

wurk once accomplished and Peace

GUARD
SERVICE
WILL HAVE TO
BE
Should Congress Determine to
Continue National Guard, It
Will Have to Be Reorgan
ized (By Review Leased Wire)
WASHINGTON, Dec. 24. If con
gress determines to continue the na
tional guard as the army reserve of
the nation. Secretary Baker said to
day, the guard service will have to be
reconstituted from the ground up. Fed
eralization of the guartl for war serv
ice, the war department has held on
the opinion of Brig. Gen. Samuel T.
Ancell. acting judge advocate general,
will wipe out of existence the federal
ized regiments. When the men are
discharged they will return to civilian
lif without any obligation ether to the
federal or state government to con
tinue in national guard service.
Mr. Baker expressed a belief that
the problem of the national guard is
bound up closely with the question of
what congress may do later in fram
ing legislation to establish a .perma
nent military policy. Should some
system of universal military training
be- worked out, army officers said, it
is probable that the national guard
would cease to exist. The war depart
ment has made no recommendation on
the subject.
There are many national guard
units organized since the war by the
various states which are not aftected
by the war department's ruling. In
some cases federal recognition has
been obtained, bringing the units un
der the federalization sections of the
act of 1916.
The great mass of the guard, how
ever, was merged into the temporary
forces of the array of the United
States for the war, thereby completely
losing its identity. These regiments,
including everdy historic military or
ganizaton n the country, some of them
wth records dating back to the Revo
lutionary war and many of them being
survivals of Civil war volunteer organ
izations, must under the ruling be re
constituted, recruited to necessary
strength, and again presented to the
ViHAT ABOUTYOUR INCOME?
The elements comprising the
body are constantly wearing out

federal government for reorganization
before they can take a place in the
federalized national guard.
Mr. Baker said he anticipated that
state authorities generally would not
attempt to reconstitute any of the old
regiments of national guard until after
the divisions into which they had been
merged return from France. It would
seem desirable, he thought, that men
to be discharged from those divisions
be given a chance to re-enlist in the
guard. This would enable, he said, the
reconstituted regiments to be in fact
as well as in name a continuation of
the old organization with tevery right
to carry the names of the historic
battles in France of Chauteau Thier
ry, the second Marne, the Ourcq, the
Vesle, St. Mihiel, Argonne Forest,
Sedan, Cote Chatillon and other places

divisions.
MORE DECISIONS BY
' THE SUPREME COURT
In the case of the Arizona Copper
company, appellant, against Enrique
Burciaga, appellee, Greenlees county,
the supreme court yesterday reversed
the lower court and remanded the
case. It was found that the instruc
tions were conflicting and confusing
and put upon the appellant-defendant
the burden of proving that it was not
its negligence that resulted in the ac
cident in which the appellee sustained
injuries for which he brought suit for
damages.
The court found error also in a rul
ing by the lower court regardless the
admission of evidence. The defendant
had put on a physician, presumably
for the . purpose of testifying to the
physical condition of the plaintiff be
fore the accident. Objection that any
communication the plaintiff might
have made to the physician was privi
leged was sustained. The defense then
offered to show that at the time of
the supposed communication the wit
ness was not in the relation of physi
cian to the plaintiff, but to his wife;
that the plaintiff made a statement
to him that he was suffering of a
venereal disease and had merely ask
ed what effect might be produced by
his condition upon a babe that had
just been born.
The appellant assigned as error the
order sustaining the objection made
that the answer called for was privi
leged because the witness was then
treating the plaintiff and his wife as
their physician.
In the case of II. C. Kimball and
Sarah N. Kimball, his wife, appellants,
against J. N. Statler. Cochise county,
the judgment of the lower court was
affirmed. Chief Justice Cunningham
suiunitting a dissenting ( pinion. Thist
wa.i an action brouuht by Statler to
compel the specific iH-rforiuani-e of n
contract. The appellee had entered in
to an agreement with Kimball, acting!
as agent for H. B. Owen and wife, toj
trade certain laml in Imperial Valley
for Arizona lands. Under the agree-1
incur. Htutler executed a deed for tho 1
lii'pciial Valley lat::U, but Kimball
could not or would not cany out his
part of the contract.
It uas coiitrmh'd among ctlicr
things that, though Kimball was the!

Great Pyres of Stark, Sheet
Covered Bodies Burn, and
Other Corpses Will Renew
Flames
(By review Leased Wire).
PAPEETE, Tahiti, Dec. 9 (Mail.)
Influenza has turned the island of
Tahiti into a enamel place. At the
crest of Papeete burn great pyres
with the stark, sheet-covered bodies
of many natives waiting to be thrown
into the glowing ashes of those Iio
hare been consumed by the flames.
The AsEOciated Press correspondent
has learned that fully one-seventh of
the population of Papeete are dead. -
In almost every native home families
are with no medicine and little atten-
tion, while the fever consumes their,
lives. They beg in vain for food. !
Deaths became so numerous in the
past week that to bury the victims
was impossible. Only the pyre was
left.
The start of the epidemic has been
traced to the arrival of a steamer here
on November 17 with many cases on
board.
Attempts to keep the epidemic from .
spreading have failed. It now has
reached the island of Moorea, where'
there are no doctors and is exacting
enormous toll there. :
In Papeeto t;ie victims of the
plague are everywhere surrounded by
the dying. Day and night trucks
rumble through the streets filled with
bodies for the constantly burning
pyres which seem never to want for
their human fuel.
Medical authorities here stated it
was the mcst widespread, destructive
epidemic iu the history of the islands.

him to the infirmary, from which he
was rapidly taken to a hospital three
miles back where he soon succumbed.
He was wounded at 7:30 p. m. on
October -8th, and died at 9:40 p. m.
the same night. This morning October
29th, I received notice of his death,
and immediately claimed the body,
that the members of the organization
with whom he had been so long might
pay him their last due respects.
We prepared his burial place in the
American cemetery here and I ar
ranged to relieve 30 men, myself
included, to attend the funeral un
der the auspices of the regimental
chaplain.
Your sou had been under my com
mand for nearly a year and we all
officers and men realize that we
have lost a true soldier, a genuine
friend and a real American comrade.
We laid him tenderly away on the
hillside this afternoon at 3:30 with
military honors.
As an officer I can say that your
son was always a soldier and a very
amiable man to work with. He was
obedient, always cheerful, never
grumbling, always on the alert and
willing to do anythiDg he could to
help things along.
With the men' he was very popu
lar and they feel his loss keenly.
His amiable disposition made them
love him, and his simple unassuming
way made his memory one which will
not soon perish from their minds.
This is not an official nor military
letter but just the statement from one
who has labored with our men for a
year and feels deeply the loss of one
with whom he has worked.
I will place a small but substantial
remembrance at the head of his burial

BREVET COMMISSIONS

CONTINUOUS FROM 1:00 TO 11:00 P. M. C

"Some form of proper recognition
by the United States government of
service rendered by local and district
boards throughout the country," is be
ing sought, according to a letter re
ceived by Dr. C. II. Hunt, chairman
of the Cochise county local board,
from members of district board No. 4,
state of Massachusetts.
It is urged that Arizona delegates
in congress and the provost marshal
general be communicated with im
mediately. The plan as set forth in
the letter is to urge that this recog
nition come in the form of medals,
diplomas or brevet commissions.
"This sen ice and the raising of our
army under the selective service law
is thought by many," the letter reads,
"to be the greatest achievement of our
government in -this crisis. Various
suggestions have been made as to the
form of this recognition, such as med
al, diploma or bfevet commission.' We
believe that the two former are not at
all acceptable, and what is desired by
the large majority of the members and
in 'act by nearly all the members, is
a brevet commisison and a medal to
be worn with the uniform, which
would recognize them as part of the
army which they helped to select and
create and which would entitle them
to become members of military bodies,
military officers' clubs, etc, which are
bound to spring up out of present as
sociations and conditions."

As an evidence of their affectionate
regard for him. the employes of The
Review surprised Mr. Cain Tuesday
afternoon by presenting him with a
handsome Elks' emblem and a brief,
whimsical testimonial expressing hope
for his future prosperity and happi
ness, signed by every one connected
with the paper. The presentation was
made by Harry Mahar. foreman of
the composing room. Mr. Cain was
too surprised and overcome to do
more than say a few words in reply.
No announcement as to who Mr.
Cain's successor will be fcas been
made.
