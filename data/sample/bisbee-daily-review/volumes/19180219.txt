HILLS BORO, I1L, Feb 18. The at
tempt cf members of a Tlgilance com
mittee here today to force alleged
member? of the L W. W. to profess
their, loyalty resulted in the death of
Clifford Donaldson, 21 year old, and
the serious injury of two other men.
Donaldson was shot when thevigi
lance committee called at the home of
his father and demanded the surrend
er of L. B. Irwin, said to be an L W.
W. propagandise and believed to be
concealed in the Donaldson home. The
coaamittee after a short parley was
met with a fusillade of shots which
caused the serious injury of S. B.
Emory, chief of police, and Ernest
Flalh, who had been assisting Emory.
Someone outside the bouse fired
shot and later it waa "cund Donaldson government's railroad wage commis
fcad been dangerously injured. He slDn xher said thev came, not to
died tonight after an operation. It
is believed Emory and Flalh will re
cover. Had Joined Navy.
Donaldson enlisted in the nary las'
Thursday and waa awaiting a call for
servics. His father declared tonight
hf was unacquainted with Irwin and
that no man answering his descrip
tion had been near the Donaldson
home.
The demonstration today came after
members of the vigilance committee
had obtained what tb.ey considered
conclusive proof that Irwin and his
followers had for several weeks con
ducted an active L W.' W. campaign
here, it was decided to make the
leaders efther manifest their allegi
ance to the government or leave the
city.
Failing to find Irwin, the committee
went to his office, piled all of his be
longings into the street and made a
bonfire of them. .
According to Mayor H. S. Butler,
examination of Irwin's possessions
disclosed evidences of an attempt by
the I. W. W. to spread their propa
ganda throughout southeastern 111
inois.
"We have tired of the activity or tie
L W. W. in this city." said Mayor But
ler tonieht- "Our best citizens have
banded together to stamp them out
and I am making no predictions as to
what would be done to any of the
leaders if they are found in this city
again."
No arrests have been made.

Railway Measure.
f,
(By Review Leaned Wire)
WASHINGTON. Feb. 18. The
cessity for increased wages for rail
road employes was conceded today
by representatives of a majority of
the railroads of the United States, ap-
ioearini for the first time' before the
oDDose rmuests of the employes, but
merely tc aid the commission by giv
ing information.
"Officials need no evidence that the
cost of living has increased and that
the low paid man needs assistance
during the war." declared J. W. Hig
gias of Chicago, executive secretary
o the Westren - Association of Rail
ways, sie&klng for th roads of the
westren district.
Many Need More Pay.
No one recognizes, more keenly
than the managements that there are
numerous classes of employes not
properly compensated." was the state
ment m&de for the eastern territory
by John G. Walber of New York, sec
retary of the bureau of information oi
eastern railways.
Mr. Higgins asserted that the low
priced man should be helped drew
from Secretary Lane, chairman of the
commission, a query as to what he
considered a low paid man.
"I would say that all men receiving
under SI 50 a' month need more money
to meet the advance in prices of ne
cessities," Mr. Higin3 replied. "Per
haps r.he limit of those who need help
I should be raised to $2,000 a . year.
which seems to be the line drawn by
the jovernment to the income tax
law. The greatest advance should be
given to the men making less than
$100 a month. These felolws must be
havia? a strenuous time."
Would Include Most Classes.
"The $2,000 limit would include all
laborers, trainmen, "brakemen. me
chanici acd clerks, and a great many
enginers and conductors," comment
ed Mr. Lane.
Mr. Higgins agreed that was true.
He diJ not suggest and definite in
crease, but remarked that perhaps the
increased living cost should be borne
for the distressed employe during the
war. Both he and Mr. Walber assert
ed that the managements have not
been unmildful of the welfare of their
employes in the past, and have given
additional pay where their finances
permitted
No Discrimination.
All the speakers declared they made
no distinction between union and un
organized employes. The course, of
wages was declared to have been up
ward since 1910, when the concerted
form of demand first used by the
brotherhoods. Especially since 1915.
the ascending trend has been notice
able, according to the speakers. Mr.
Walbet said that from January. 1916.
to the latter part of 1917, the pay of
siklled labor and clerks increased' 15
per rent in the eastern district and
unskilled labor from 25 to 100 per
cent He declared the tenure or po
sition wss very constant in the rail
road service and attributed this to
the loyalty of many employes who re.
fused Either wares in industrial plants
to remain with the roads.

Our slock unfortunately has been very
'limited until thir new shipn.ent arrived,
and many persons have been waiting for
them, not wishing to purchase a cheap,
unreliable trunk, knowing it to be a waste
of money and uruafe to trust their valua

WE WERE INDEED FORTUNATE
to receive these staple magnificent sturdy

conditions so unsettled, and even more
fortunate at securing them to sell at such
a moderate price. HARTMAN trunks are nationally known as the enly reliable
haggage to trust ones belongings with. and the big, heavy, solid cast corners and mas
sive locks, together with the almo3t indestructable sides of finely finished black
patented Hartman composition, built over genuine non-sagging frame, gives one the
confidence and satisfaction that only the higher grade luggage can.

Members of the board of directors i
of the Warren District Chamber of
Commerce at their last meeting
heartily endorsed the proposal of "the
Ckamber of Commerce of the Cnited
Stctes to discriminate against Ger
many in trade after the war. if neces
sary for self defense. The proposal
was placed before the local board by
the national organization in the for-n
of a resolution upen which chambers
of commerce throughout the United
States were requested to take a ref
erendum vote. The endorsement by 1
the Warren district club has been for
warded to Washington.
The purpose of the referendum, as
explained by the national body, is to
secure the opinions of the commer
cial organization of Ihe country
The national organization has neit.ier
approved or dissented from the pro
position, and only the vote of the
member organizations can ccinmit
the chamber of commerce of the
United States for or against the pro
position. In placing the resolution before the
nation's chambers of commerce, the
national bdy outlines an alfirmative
argument for the resolution. Th-;
board of directors has held the ques
tion one of national character and
importance, and the Boston chamber
prepare! the argument for submis
sion. . i
The resolution reads as follows: i
Wtereas: the size cf Germany's
present artr.ament and b?r militaristic .
attitude have been due to the fact
her government is an autocracy, nt
reTX"Sible to the German people,
and I
Whereas: the size of the German!
armament after the war will be the!
measure of the greatness of the ar-;
mament forced cn all ljations. and :
Whereas: careful analysis of ec.
nomic conditions shows that the size
cf Cermany's future armament will
fundamentally depend on her after-j
v.rr receipts of war materials and j
profits trcm her foreign trade, and 1
Whereas: in cur opinion the Anieri-i
can people for the purpose of pre-:
venting an excessive armament will
assuredly enter an economic combin-
ation against Germany if govern-!
mental conditions in Germany make!
it necessary for self-defence; and i
Whereas: we believe the American
recple will not join in discrimination
s gainst German goods after the war
if the danger of excessive armament;
las been removed by the fact that j
the German government has in real
itr beccre a responsible instrument
crntr-TieJ by the German people;
t'terefcre. be it
II' Ff'.-rrd. that the Chamber of Com
;:cc cf tre United States of Amer-
Oo', ': r?Tet!y calls the attention of
Jfi'-"! business met of Germany to
hesr conditions and urges them also
It? study this situation and to co--10irr?i2'?
to the end that a disastrous

Pecos'V alley Oil
This field in which oil has been known to exist for
many years is now being rapidly developed. A num
ber of the liz companies being in the field. Among
them being the Great Western Oil and Refining Co.
The Standard Oil Company. The Home Investment
Company of Oklahoma. All of these companies have
already brought Sn one or more producing vwells afrfl
are sinking other wells rapidly. Land in what is known
to be proven oil land extending from 40 to 50 miles in
length on either side of the Pecos river and from 12 to
1 5 miles in width, this land, much of which was of very
little value for any other purpose is now eagerly sought
after and high prices paid for oil leases. Among the
most active companies in the field is the Lake Arthur
Oil Company, with 18,000 acres in the heart of the
proven field. This is the oioneer comDany and the land
was carefully selected by Prdf. Milton McWhorter, when
the choice of the entire field was to be had. Prof. Mc
Whorter is an authority on oil lands and has visited
personally practically fall ;the. oil fields of any conse
quence in this country and Europe. He is now devoting
his entire time in this field and states that this- will be
the largest oil fiefd in the United States and that the oil
is oaraffin base and runs very high in gasoline.
The Lake Arthur company has three fully equipped
oil rigs working. One well already producing oil and
two other wells nearing the oil depth which should be
brought in within the next 60 days. These wells be
ing sunk are artesian wells, which have always produced
some oil, but are now being deepened down to the main
oil bearjng sands. The artesian water has been cased
out by forcing cement down, throupft small pipes by
which the artesian water is entirely eliminated. Bisbee
Deople have now perhaps the only opportunity they will
have to get some of this stock at one dollar per share, as
when sufficient funds are raised to oay for casing the
two new wells being sunk, there will most likely he no
necessity for more stock to be sold, as the oil produced
is now bringing $3.00 per barrel at the refinery at Lake
Arthur. This will not only nay for further development
but will soon be paying dividends to its stockholders.
The directors, at a meeting on lanuary 31st, passed
a resolution that after April 1st. 1918. no more stock
would be sold for less than $2.00 and if the pew wells
now being drilled are heavy producers, such as the first
one, the price will be, far above $2.00 .
DR. M. W. LANG
of the Lake Arthur Oil Company, is now at the Antlers
Hotel while here. Samples of oil and gasoline are in
display in Sasse's window on Main Street.
