Hoarding Or Storage of Nec
essities of Life In Order To
Limit Supply To Be Termed
. Felony.
(By Review Leased Wire).
WASHINGTON'. June 2. The first
of the administration food bills,
already passed by the house,
passed the senate late today
without a record vote. Numerous
amendments were attached.
The bill as finally accepted by the
senate provides for a comprehensive
survey of ftod resources and for the
stimulation of agriculture, and re
stricts drastically the storing of food
stuffs, fuel an dother necessities and
speculation. The restrictive provisions
were added by the senate; The bill
carries a total appropriation of ap
proximately $11.1)00,000 compared w ith
$11,770,000 as it passed the house.
Hoarding or storage of food, fuel or
other necessaries of life in order to
limit the supply or affect prices would
be niade a felony under the senate
ampniiniraL but farmers who hold
their own products would be excepted.
The amendment restricting futures
trading, written by Senator Nelson and
voted into the bill, 37 to 17, just before
passage, provides:
Restricts Trading.
"If at any time during the pendency
of the existing war between the United
States and the German empire, the
President of the United States shall
lind that dealings in futures in or
about any grain exchange unduly or
unreasonably raises or enhances the
price of wheat or other food cereal to
the Injury of the people of the United
States, he shall at once restrict the
traders in such exchange to discon
tinue such trading as specified by him
as dealing in futures.
"In case such request of the Presi
dent is lfot promptly complied with,
then he is hereby empowered to order
such dealing in futures, as last afore
said, to be entirely suspended and dis
continued for such limited time as he
may direct, and if such order is not
promptly complied with, be may by
proclamation declare such exchangei
closed and thereafter it shall be un
lawful to utilize or permit to be util
ized such building or room as a grain
exchange r for any person being a
trader in grain on such exchange to en
gage in the business there conducted
on or at such closed exchange.
"Any person violating any of the
provisions of this act shall be punished
by a fine of not less than $500 or by
imprisonment for not more than one
year, tr toy both such fine and im
prisonment" Power Is Curtailed.
The senate also voted to curtail the
inquisitorial power of the President in
investigation of food resources. The
house bill would compel the attend
ance of witnesses and submission of
bcoks and other records under heavy
penalty. The senate agricultural com
mittee amended the measure giving
the secretary of agriculture authoriza
tion to investigate the food situation,
making it the duty of any person
"when requested by the secretary to
answer all questions necessary to car
ry into effect the provisions of this
section." TWe house appropriation of
$2,522,000 to pay for the survey was
accepted.
The section authorizing the govern
ment to sell seeds to the farmers was
aimed to provide that sales be for
cash only. The power to compel per
sons having seeds at their disposal to
furnish them to the government was
curtailed greatly and the appropriation
carried for the work was reduced from
$5,779,000 to $2,500,000.
ROM A STAFF CORRES
PONDENT OF THE ASSO
CIATED PRESS WITH THE
BRITISH ARMIES IN
i FRANCE, via London, June 2,
7:30 p. m. While overcast skies
have limited the aerial offensive
in the last few days, British pilots
continue to bring in accounts of
German airplanes breaking to
pieces in the air shortly after be
ing attacked. This tendency has
been notable for more than a fort
night. Once shot out of control
the German planes have lost their
wings, tails and pther gears to
such an extent that when .they
finally crash to the grpund very
little wreckage can be seen.
A day or two ago a British pilot
flew at an enemy machine head
on, maneuvering at the last mo
ment just in time to avoid a col
lision. One of the wings of the
British plane scraped one of the
German wings, whereupon the lat
ter began to fall. The British pi
lot dived after him and was start
led to see the German's damaged
wings fly completely off while the
tail dragged as if its back was
troken.
Floating Clouds Used
As Screens by Germans.
Whether faultiness in so many
German machines is due to the
speed which the Germans have to
turn the mout to meet the British
offensive, or to lack of suitable
material is a matter of no concern
on this side of the line.
Recent attempts by the Ger
mans to use floating clouds as
screens for airplane raids have
led to some rfether spectacular
sky bombardments by British anti
aircraft guns.
These guns have occasionally
driven the raiders from covers
and forced the mto turn back ove
their own lines. German aviators
seem especially trained in the de
fensive use of clouds, for during
air battles if bit of passing va
por is available hey invariably
dive or side-step into it. This is
only another demonstration of the
German passion for digging in,
such as first brought the world
war to trench fighting.
Artillery Activity Is
Crowing In Intensity.
The Germans dig in on the land
in the air and under the sea.
The artillery, activity appears
gradually to be growing in intens
ity along most of the British front
with raids and counter raids go
ing on first in one sector and then
in anothe. These raids are the
means that the armies have of
Keeping in touch with the enemy
and harrassing him. First intro
duced in the Britis harmies by
the Canadians, raids were taken
up by the Ft-ench and Germans.
The last named were never very
successful at the art, however, al
though recently captured Ger
mans asssrted their company com
manders promised them Iron
Crosses and long leaves of ab
sence if they brought back even
one British prisoner In a raid.

ASHINGTON. June 2. Reports

withheld, but officials permited it to
become known today that the report
had caused some concern here. They
indicated that they had positive con

cure control of the Island tut that

EGYPT IS ENJOYING
PROSPERITY, RESULT"
OF COTTON DEMAND
Crops Will Be Double That of
List Year, With Unpreced
ented Prices; Country Is
Showered With Riches.
(By Review Leased Wire)
CAIRO, Egypt, June 2. Egypt is
enjoying an abundant prosperity as a
result of the increase in the price of
cotton which doubled within three
months last fall, declares the Acting
Financial advisor in outlining the
Egyptian budget for the current year.
"Egyptian cotton," he asserts, "rose
to heights unknown since the Amer
ican civil war. The result Is that,
notwithstanding the relatively Inferior
yield of the present crop, it probably
will realize more than 40,000,000 or
about double that of last year.
"The continued presence In Egypt
of a large British force has at the
same time exercised its influence as
a second factor in the exceptional
prosperity of the country. The re
sources of Egypt and the Sudan have
been drawn upon in every conceiv
able manner for military require
ments, and the productive activities
of the population have been stimul
ated in all directions to meet the de
mand." ,
Resource Increased.
The 'Acting Financial Advisor esti
mates that during the two and a half
years which have elapsed since the
commencement of the war a sum of
30.000,000 has been added to the
capital resources of Egypt.
-"This considerable and unbooked
for accession of wealth," continues
the advisor,' "does not permit of any
fresh development of the country's
economic resources for the present,
owing to the difficulty of obtaining
the necessary materials, which dif
ficulty is, in fact, actually bringing
about a tendency fo retrogression by
delaying the necessary upkeep of
works already la existence. The
sums are consequently being era
ployed in investments abroad, where
they operate as a. set off to the In
debtedness of the country probably
to the extent of one-third of the
private .capital invested from foreign
resources, and relieve to that extent
the heavy tribute which the country
has to pay annually to its creditors
abroad."
Imports Also Jump.
The advisor showed that imports in
1916 totalled neary 31,000.000 in
value, as compared with 19,000,000
in 1915, and have even exceeded thef
figures for the year preceding the
war. This Is not due to any lavish
expenditure on the part of the people,
but is mainly attributed to the great
ly increased prices of practically all
imports. Exports in 1916 amounted
to 37,500,000.
"When one considers," resumes the
advisor, "the general situation in
Egypt as compared with ' that of
other countries. It appears as one of
singular felicity. Placed at a criti
cal point In the theatre of war, thei
waves of invasion nevertheless beat
harmlessly against the well-guarded,
frontiers, while her inhabitants, in
the enjoyment of a sheltered peace,
see unlooked for riches bestowed up
on them. The reflection that the
country Is thus profiting from the
terrible conflict which is convulsing
the world may well exercise a re
straining influence on any tendency
to waste those profits on extrav
agant living.
Cotton Area Enlarged.
"The re-enlargements of the cotton
area in 1916, cdupled with the diffi
culties attendant on the important of
cereals from other countries, has
naturally diminished the available
supplies of this category of foodstuffs.
Some portion of the surplus stock of
1915 has, however.no doubt been avail
able to supplement the production of
1916, and no serious shortage is
anticipated until the forthcoming
harvest." ;
"The general level of wholesale
prices of commodities produced in
the country has risen to 32 per cent
over July 1914. This rise Is attribut
able, on the one hand, to the in
creased demand, both civil and mili
tary, one the resources of the coun
try, and, on the other, to the difficul
ty of supplementing those resources
by imports. If the war continues, the
diminution of the productive power
of other countries will become more
marked and It may become necessary
for Kypt to assist the allied cause
fy contributing supplies from lei
comparative abundance, even though
to do so may entail on her further
sacrifices."
Sour Stomacn.
This is a mild form of indigestion.
It is usually brought on by eating too
rapidly or too much, Vr of food not
suited to your digestive organs. If you
will eat slowly, masticate your food
thoroughly, eat but little meat and
none at all for supper, you will more
than likely avoid the sour stomach
without taking any medicine whatever.
When you have sour stomach take one
of Chamberlain's Tablets to aid diges

A COMMUNICATION. '
As a horrible example of some of the letters received
by all editors, the communication, printed in another
column of this morning's paper is excellent The original
text, if reproduced as a fac-simile, would do considerable
credit to the ability and judgment of a fourteen-year old
school boy. As a glaring instance of what thought which
appears reprehensible, pur communication is in a class
by itself.
After reading the tract several times, during which it
was necessary to remove many vowels in past participles
changing bakeing to baking and to otherwise make
the letter at least readable, we have come to the conclus
ion that the writer had in mind some argument
against the United States' enry into the war against
the Imperial German Government On the other hand
the subjects handled would lead one to the belief that
it is a conglomerate polemic against anything and everything..
"Why do we wirh to help Europe?" asks the communi
cation, which adds: "There has never been anything bo
wonderful done for the United States by Europe."
Is there anyone in the country who never heard of
Lafayette, Rochambeau or Kosciuszko? Is the fair name
of Prance forgotten in this country? Has Its part in the
revolution and the part of its leaders been lost in the
maelstrom of our success as a nation? We would say
that it has not Concrete proof of our affection for
France and its people was witnessed when Field Marshal
Joffre and Minister of Justice Viviani appeared in this
country some weeks ago. The author of our communi
cation had best do a little treading before putting hi?
(or her) conclusions 'on paper.
In the next paragraph of the communication the popular
song title "Dont Bite the Hand That's Feeding You" if
used. It was probably injected Into the article to show
that the author was a patron of the arts principally
music
The conclusion of the sentence, which started with .the
reference to the "hand" and the "bite" and the "feed."
reads: "so why not stay on our own soil and fight" If
the author is a German sympathizer he, or she, need but
look on any war map.- We do not know of any German
soil that has been defiled. On the other hand we have
seen pictures of a devastated France, a pillaged and
raped Belgium, a razed Servia and a subjugated Poland
Autocracy has placed its heavy hand on the peoples of
these nations and it is this autocracy that the people of
the United States must put down.
People, generally, do not see why the United States
has been forced into a state of war. A story is in order,
that the situation may be brought home to some of our
readers. ,
'Once upon a time there lived a versatile family. The
father was an excellent farmer, the mother a famous
baker; one son was an artificer of iron and brass and
another a tailor of worth. Regularly, another son, who
was known throughout the region in which the family
lived as an able stage driver, would take of the finished
products of his brothers and his mother and the grain
raised by his father a small cargo. This he disposed of
to his neighbors, some of whom lived several leagues
away.
'Several of 'his neighbors became involved in a con
troversy, which led to widespread fighting. The family
Fold to the nearest and most accessible neighbors and
Several of the others would intercept the son who carried
the products to market. At times his goods were merely
damaged and thrown away. On other occasions his cart
and animals were killed. Finally he was killed. The
family lost its marketing device and the father had to
quit raising grain. The mother quit baking, the son
quit fashioning in iron and brass and no clothes were
woven from the carded wool. The famly was reduced
to nothing and could trade none of its products for those
made by the neighbors. The family became extinct and
lost its name for the most productive and prosperous
entity in the region.'
America is the versatile family and the Imperial Ger
man Government is the neighbor who attacked a friend
and destroyed its mainstay, its people, and -its life. Is
not the story, brought to the present day. illustrative of
the necessity which drives the United States to a de
fense? It not the condition, terrible as it may seem to
timid mothers and fond fathers, one which demands a
sacrifice on tie part of tie cliildreo of the nation?
As for the inference, in the communication, that the
United States should not be fighting the Imperial Ger
man Government, there are too many arguments in favw
of democracy as against autocracy. Otto II. Kahn,
German born man, aptly put the answer to the question
which afronts all Americans of Teutonic origin.
"Speaking as one born of German parents," 'he said,
"I do not hesitate to state it is my deep conviction that
the greatest service which persons of German birth or
antecedents can render to the country of their origin
to adhere and stand up for those great ideals and tradi
tions which they and their ancestors inherited and
which they were brought up. They must set their faces
like flint against the monstrous doctrines and acts of
rulership which has robbed them of the Germany which
they loved and which had the affection and the admlra
tion of the world.
"It is my deep conviction that the more unmistakably
and whole-heartedly they throw themselves into the strug
gle which this country has entered in order to rescue
Germany, no less thai) the rest of the world, from those
sinister forces that are, in President Wilsons language
the enemy of all mankind, the better they protect and
serve the old name."
Our correspondent is not to be censured unduly. His,
or her, communication, is the result of Ignorance, pa ran
cia, or cowardice. We would recommend that corres
pondents, before writing to any newspaper, conduct an
argument with themselves and then put their conclusions
on paper.
80UTHERN CALIFORNIA LOS ANGELES.
Los Angeles papers and several of the preachers of
that city are protesting to the war department against
the establishment of a military training camp at San
Diero. Los Angeles is UD-in-arms over the affair. Tt
think that the "metropolis" of Southern California should
be neglected in favor of a city which is so close to the
border! Awful.
San Diego seems to have been chosen by the war de
partment for the camp. Inasmuch as the general staff's
actions have been remarkably free from politics It is hard
to see how anything but actual worth succeeded In land
ing the coveted plumb for the southernmost city in the
Golden State. Yet the ministers of Los Angeles are
wiring that' the "war department should not send the
youth of the nation to San Diego, which is near that sink
of iniquity, Tia Juana.'
But for Arizona Los Angeles would be an overgrown
village. It is to be wondered whether the big California
town for it Is not a city ever realized the worth of
Arizona's patronage, its money and its people San Diego
is more or less in the same cats gory, with reference to
its suppdrt, but San Diego at least is less noisy about it
We wonder whether the war department will allow
ltelf to be fooled by the "holler" of the ministers, which
cloaks the commercial necessity of the greatest city of
parasites in the country. There is not much possibility
of that occurlng.
Bisbee Is not jealous of Douglas, nor of Tucson. Wher-
.. . . . . . a
ever the war department aeciaes 10 senu hs unmm
men in Arizona, the towns in this state will rejoice. We
do not accuse our neighbor communities of everything
reprehensble and adopt the "dog in the manger" attitude.
' " THE STRIKE'S LULL.
Backed by the federal government which has gone on
record both from the president and from the secretary
of labor as being unalterably opposed to any labor dis
turbances "during the period of the war, the striking
miners at Jerome appear to be giving way. I. has come
to be the only way out It must of necessity, be that the
operators will retain their former system In the treat
ment of labor, with the increased wage scale in effect.
The proposal that the men who remained loyal to the
companies be discharged is ridiculous on the fact of the
entire affair. It was promptly dismissed as impossible
when advanced by the strike leaders.
Then too, the call of the nation is too much for a
handful of strikers to oppose. There is no sympatny
with the object of the walk-out. Friends of labor are
opposed to the policy adopted at Jerome. There can be
no labor war won by labor when its object is so selfish
as that at Jerome has been found to be.

A self-contained Central Africa.
he writes, "stretching as far as pos
sible to the west, and the possibility
of a land connection of Central Africa
with Constantinople by way of Egypt
maWes the scheme seem particularly
attractive. But world economics and
world politics cannot be pursued with
Central Africa alone. We need other
bases also for our world trade and
sea traffic. In the Far tst in tne
Pacific Ocean we have? for three de
cades possessed a risps little colo

forgivable and irreparable mistake if
we Were to abandon our South Seas
colonies and to withdraw from the
Pacific, merely because the great set
tlement of interests has begun among
the three great powers Japan. North
America and England-Australia, and
because we shall have to fear that
some later date we should come
into contact with these, powers.
If the three powers were to ar
rive at a perfect and permanent agree-
ent about the Pacific Ocean and
China our case v.ould be hopeless.
But as long as Japan and America
oppose one another in more or less
open hostility, and as long as Austra
lia sees in Japan, whom England has
summoned to the protection of her
interests in the East her most dan
gerous competitor and opponent as
long as these things arp so, Germany
has no occasion to budge from the
Pacific.
"A temporary occupation of our col

The professor concludes: "If Ger

resume in grand style the competi

Why do we wish to help Europe?
There ha3 never been anything so

most of the Germans in tills country
have earned their bread and butter un

their best friends, and where do we
stand today?
"Don't bite the band that's feeding
you I" is a very good motto, and a true
one. But show the world where are
there very many that abide by it. Ev
ery 'one, of course, wants to protect
their flag and country, so why not stay
on their own soil and fight? Let each
country fight her own battles. It's a

seems to be placing them on the water
for targets for the German submarines.
They are h'jme mothers' boys and tbey

as sweet to these mothers a3 President
Wilson is to his mother.
Notoriety seems to be woman's one '
ambition. For instance: a woman out
trying to get boys to enlist in the army j
and navy. She had better be in the 1
kitchen baking bread or sewing for
the benefit of 'our boys at the front
It would be more appreciated by Uncle
Sam.
Can you imagine woman aviators,

can do it, but it is no place for a worn-:

STOCK IN MICHIGAN
VERDE IS PURCHASED
BY EASTERN CAPITAL
One of the most important deals
that has recently been closed in Ari
zona mining circles, is reported by Mr.
A. M. McLellan, of Phoenix, vice
president of . the Michigan Verde Cop
per Company. Mr. McLellan states
that negotiations which the Western
Copper Syndicate have been carrying
on with big New York Interests have
been closed, whereby the New York
people will place four hundred thou
sand shares of Michigan Verde stock
in the east.
In speaking of the prospects of his
company, Mr. McLellan was most en
thusiastic, and states that in his opin
ion this deal, together with the heavy
Arizona subscriptions to Michigan
Verde, assures the future of that prop
erty. Those who are familiar with the lo
cation of the Michigan Verde proper
ty, in its relation to the Clark and
United Verde Extension properties of
the Jerome district, have always ex
pressed the opinion that with devel
opment it would make a producer, and
the officers of the company now feel
that money for that development will

cently and proceeded over a number of
the state highways, inspecting the
state work as they traveled.
Mr. Maddock stated that the roads
in the southern part of the state were
in far better condition than in the
northern part He attributed this to
the fact that money is more plentiful
in the mining sections than in the ag
ricultural idstricts.
"The Toad north to Clifton is one ol
the best mountainous highways that I
traveled over. It is even better than
the road leading from Phoenix to
Globe and the Roosevelt Dam. At
present there Is lots of travel over the
different highways, and it seems to be
getting heavier all the time." Mr.
Maddock was lavisn in his praise of
this seetion of the state.

GRAIN REQUIREMENTS
OF ALLIES GREATER
THAN U.SJAN SUPPLY
Hoover Denies Report That
Uncle Sam Is Planning To
Buy Up Grain Crops For
Distribution.
(By Review Leased Wire).
WASHINGTON, June 2. The grain
requirements of the allies and the
European neutrals were put at 917,000,
000 bushels, a total of much more than
the United States can supply, in a
statement by Hervert C. Hoover today.
listing the miuimum needs of each na
tion for human consumption and for
feed.
"It will, of course, be impossible,"
said Mr. Hoover, "for N'Jrth America
to furnish all of this quantity, althoagn
the major load must fall on us. In
every event it emphasizes the necess
ity for control of exports in order to
control prices and protect our supply
and the necessity i'jr conservation and
elimination of waste in order to in
crease the volume of our exports."
Mr. Hoover believes the United
States and Canada can export this
year at least 600,000,000 bushels of
grain. If the winter wheat crop im
proves and the spring crop is larger
than normal, he believes this will be
increased to 800,000,000. Shipment ol
that much grain, most of it wheat, will
t'jrce American consumers to eat less
wheat than usual.
Co-ordination of allied food pur
chases will be established as soon es
the food bills and the export limita
tions'act becomes law. At present the
allies and neutral countries are pur
chasing in large quantities for future
delivery. There is no guarantee that
these will be made as the government
may Tiold up contracts to asstre an
adequate Rodsupply at home.
Mr. Hoover denied a report that the
food administration will buy the courf
try's grain crop for distribution. There
is no intention, he said, of going into
the grain business.
More than a dozen women home ec
nomics experts called on Mr. Hoover
today to learn how they may assist in
food conservation. Most of them are
teachers of home economics In wom

held the C. & A. boys runless over half
the session. The batteries were Wald
rldge and Jeuck for the Junction
Briggs and Anhier and Cottram for the
C. & A. nine.
Today the C. & A. team and the Cole
Tigers will mix. The game will be
called at 1:30 p. m. On. Tuesday the
Copper Queen flingers, who are the
leaders of the league, and the Cole
Tigers will come to bat The battle is
set for 2:30 p. m. and a fast game is
predicted by everyone.
The Tigers are fast rounding, into
midsummer form, and will probably
give the spectators a run for their
money. The Queen team was slow in
starting, but under the able direction
of Bert Whaling has gotten together a
winning combination ha will be hard
to beat. Altogether, a red-hot session
is expected from these two whirlwinds.
Next Sunday the Junctiou-Briggs
will face the Copper Queen sackers,
and between the two they 'ought to fur
nish plenty of action for the delecta
tion of the fans. The attendance at
the games is improving and President
Mitchell is very optimistic over the
future showing.,
He stated that steps were taken at
the last meeting between the mana
gers to eliminate another recurrence
of last Sunday's trouble. The umpires
have been given unlimited authority,
under the supervision of the league
president, and will decide all disputes.
They will also preserve Vrder in the
stands.

STRONG BULL MARKET
IN U.S. PREDICTION
OF POPULAR BROKER
CJ. Killick, of New York
City, Says It Is Safe To Buy
Coppers, Industrials and
Steel For "A Long PulL"
(By Reiew Leased Wire).
The United States ! son the verge
of a bullish market movement was
the. opinion expressed last night by
C. J. Killick. manager of the
York office of Hughes & Dier. brok
ers, who is in Bisbee for a visit of
several days. Mr. Killick is taking a
vacation ffom the whir and whirl of
New York business life at present to
prepare for tne excitement on me
market that he confidently expects
will soon make its presence known In
no gentle manner.
Here is Killick idea of the present
situation, as he has sized it up in his
Broad Btreet offices:
"The United States government is
tringing out the greatest war loan In
the history of finance. Now It la evi
dent to any thinking man that no stone
will be left unturned to make it a com
plete success. And It must be under
stood that complete success depends
on finding the American people In a
receptive mood. In other words the
stage setting must be just right- With
this end in view, the powers that be
in the financial world will start a bull
movement the like of which has not
been seen in years. Industrials and
coppers will lead the van, arid the
money made in them' will, both from
patriotic and business motives largely.
flow into the government coffers, and
to this argument there H no denial.
"Those who have followed the ca
reer of our president will certainly I
never accuse him of being a creature
of Impulse. Much as he regretted to
take the step, he went into this war
with a clear vision of what had to be
done, and, now that it has been taken,
and the Liberty Loan ordered, it is
absolutely cetain that the groundwork
will be laid for it to fall on ready
takers, and the taking is always best
on a bull market. , Therefore the in
ference is plain to me that there .will
be a strong market for an indefinite
period, and, while of course natural
reactions will set in from time to time
it will be safe to buy coppers, steels
and all industrials for a long pull. Tbe
rails will adjust themselves and show
material advances in price in the near
future."

Meats And Sugars For Win
ter Use.
(By Review Leased Wire.)
WASHINGTON, June 2. An in
creased vegetable diet was urged ou
the American people today by Her
bert C. Hoover as a means of serving
the supply of staple foodstuffs. In
i an appeal to the country's housewives,
of staples and that probable needs of
this country next winter.
"We want the American people to
increase the proportion of vegetables
, in their diet for many reasons." Mr,
i Hmv ..Veethe including
. otl.,0. comDO hut . Bmall tnt.tinn
of the (iiet of the Americans, consid-
ered as a nation.
"Of our total foodstuffs. In terms
of units, only about fourteen per cent
are supplied in the form of vegetables
while some forty per cent arises from
cereal products, including bread, zt,
per cent from various animal pro
ducts, and 13 per cent from sugar. The
widespread agitation throughout the
country to Increase production of the
foodstuffs has resulted in a large ex
pansion of the garden area and with
normal weather conditions we may
hope for a greatly lcreased supply of
garden vegetables. These may be us
ed elthe by direct consumption' dur
ing the summer months or by dispos
ing to vegetable markets. '
"The more simple and direct thing
is to increase the proportion of vege
tables In the diet during the months
of July, August and September and
thus save a portion of the meats and
sugars for winter use. Double the pro
portion of vegetable and thus decrease
the drai non meats and sugars; pub
lic health will not only be normal but
especially tiurin gthe summer months
will even be improved if the propor
tion of vegetable s-in tbe general diet
is doubled."

BERLIN, June 2 (Via London. 3:35

was reiterated today by Baron von Den

to the Associated Press.
"Rumtirs that ' we are intentionally

wholly without foundation," said the
baron. "We are aware that such as

apparently with Lie purpose of Influ
encing the United States into adopt

confirmed stories reaching us are of
similar construction.
"As has been explaiend repeatedly,

tries desiring to leave Germany must
conform to fixed military passports
and regulations, restrictions which
also rigidly apply to our own citizens
desiring to cross the frontiers or

NEW YORK, June 2. The shares

tures today, buying being influenced
by the more tranquil state of affairs
in that country and the strength in
this quarter of the list imparted an
aspect of firmnesp to the general
market in the first hour. The failure
of the broader outside buying power
to develop accelerated belief that the
demand of this character for the time
being sftems to have pretty well spent
itself, and that unless more conserva
tive factors than those recently di
lated upon assert themselves buying
is likely to be further contracted and
the weight of holdings thrown on the

burdensome.
The action of the market in the past
few days is reflective of an undercur
rent of apprehension over internation

PUBLISHERS EXPLAIN
WHY RAISE IN MAIL

(
Direct Tax On Advertising
Receipts Is Urged Instead
By Newspaper And Maga
zine Representatives.
(By Review Leased Wire.)
WASHINGTON. June 2. War taxa
tion of publishers' advertising rates
rather than increase of their postage '
rate.. T'n a vlcnrnnalv urfrorl trwlav ;
renresentiiMve nf notinn-i ...hiichin,
interests at an informal conference
with senators who are re-drafting the
war tax bill.
Newspaper, magazine, trade, relig
ious, farm and many other publishing
Interests, Joined in the plea. Senator
Simmons, chairman of the finance
commtitee; Senator Penrose, senior
Republican member, and Senator
Smoot received the publishers' repre-
senjatievs. The increased postage
rate would put many publishers out of
business and could not be passed
along, they said, while a tax 'on adver
tising receipts could be met Ay in
creased advertising rates.
) Hardwick Plan Opposed.
The plan proposed by Senator Hard
wick and indorsed by the postoffice
department, to leave present rates on
news portions of publications and
heavily increase that used for adver
tising, was condemned by the publish
ers a more detrimental to their inter
ests than the house zjne system, al
ready rejected by the committee.
. In asking the publishers' views. Sen
ator Simmons made it clear the com
mittee was determined to levy war
taxes of same sort upon publishers. He
suggested a combination postage and
advertising tax, but the publishers pro
tested against any change in mail
rates.- Senator Simmons pointed out
that letter rates are to be increased
one-half, pbstcard rates doubled, and
parcel post shipments taxed, adding
that there was a strong sentiment in
congress against excepting second
class mail entirely from the increase.
"Newspapers are not deslorus of es
caping a task." the committee was told
by Elbert H. Baker, of the Cleveland
Plain-Dealer, chairman of the execu
tive committee of the American News
paper Publishers' Assocaition.
Simmons Determined.
"But we would rather have a direct
tax on advertising receipts at a fair
rate than any change in the postage
rates. Such a change might become
permanent. All of us prefer to have
the postage question handled separate
ly from war tax legislation."
To a statement hy Senator Penrose
that thousands of letters are being re
ceived by members of congress pro
testing against increased letter rates
if second class rates are allowed to
stand. Mr. Baker replied that the One
cent Letter Postage League, Contrib
uted to by manufacturers, was behind
a propaganda of that kind.

(Continued From Page One)
Three Britis hsoldiers who had been
j given up as Jost returned to their
lines yesterday after three days be
hind the German outposts without
food. The trio became lost on pa
trol duty and discovered they were
inside the German lines. They hid
in a shell hole during the day time
and tried for three successive nights
to return to tne Br'tlsh lines hefore
thev finally succeeded.
Such experience sare possible now -

front line for outpost positions as !
they esist in the battle area east of

!armies were in trench positions.
Then each side became accustomed to
the other's trench habits and the
slightest unfamiliar move by day or
night had an easily defined signifi -
cance. East or Arras there are only
short stretches of trenches with poats
between them but each shell hole is
a potential strong point and may hold
a nest of machine guns. A chain of
connected shell craters makes a first
class trench, position under the new
order of things.
CITIES PREPARING TO
CELEBRATE TUESDAY
The following telegram was received :
yesterday from Malcolm Frazer, secre-.
tary to Governor Thomas E. Campbell,
relative to Registration Day:
"Governor's proclamation 'jf Regis

rtv an n.,M.Hi. nv., nH ti,r
business will take holiday under city
authorities' nroclamatAms."
;
"This seems to be the psychological
time,' however," Senator Simmons in-
terjected, "for publishers to accept a
postage raise that is Inevitable. Print
paper prices are high and the increase
decided on might be less now than
hen conditions are changed."
The amendment suggested by Sena
tor Simmons proposed to Increase sec
ond class rates by 25 or 50 per cent
to 1 1-4 o rl 1-2 cents a pound with
a tax on advertising receipts of 1-2 per
cent
"It is not wise or American to in
crease second class postage," said Al
lan H. Richardson, of New York, rep
resenting the American Periodical
Publishers' Association.
"It is not justified even by war con
ditions, and most unsatisfactory."

It has an excellent property of unusual merit and promise that will undoubtedly

It has a very low capitalization only 450,000 shares, par value $1.00 each, fully

It is only about one-half mile from the "12,000-ton a day" Ray Consolidated and
adjoins the Ray Silver-Lead and Ray Broken Hill, whose proverfore bodies trend in its

It is selling at a comparatively low price, which should reasonably be increased

Its officers and management are of the best.

mar hew laws will
BECOME EFFECTIVE IN
" THE IIEXT FEW
ing Circulated Against
Others. Host of Laws Un
touched.
Within the next few days eighty
new laws, placed on the statute books
by the third state legislature and ap
proved by Governor Campbell, will be
come effective. Unless it carries the
emergency clause, a law does not be
come effective until ninety days after
its approval by the governor, but as
the legislative session came to an end
on March 8 and most of the laws
were approved promptly by the gover-1
nor, they will, with the exception o j
those against which a referendum has ;
been iavokeod, become effective dur
ing the first part of this month. -
Three of the laws passed by the last
legislature and signed by the governor
will not go Into effect at this time, ref
erendum petitions bearing the re
quired number of signatures having
been filed against them with the sec
retary of state. They are the red
light abatement law, which was pat-
terned after the California statute, and
which penalires landlords; the anti
gambling bill which makes the partici
pant equally guilty with the keeper of
the game and which sought to include
punchboards within the list of forbid
den amusements, and the minimum
wage for women. All of the measures
will now have to be refeijed to the
people for approval at the nest general
election.
Referendum petitions are also being
circulated against the county highway
commission bill, the high school cadet
bill and the bills creating game pre
serves in various parts of the stat ".. In
spite of the popular denunciation of
its action in attempting to file a refer
endum against the bill providing for
military training in the high schools,
the Socialist party has persisted in its
efforts to refer the measure. At So
cialist headquarters in Phoenix it was
stated tnat the work of securing sig
natures to delay the operation of the
law : was still going tn. Opposition to
the creation of four game preserves in
addition to the large areas now fir
bidden to sportsmen on Indian reserva
tions has been general in many parts
of the state.
In spite of the referendum, however,
a number of laws aimed at regulation
of the health and morals of the state
will take effect this month. Important
among these are the drastic anti
cigarette law, which makes it a misde
meanor for a minor to buy, or accept,
tobacco in any form, or to sell or give
tobacco to minors. Another law, de
signed to strengthen ' the prohibition
amendments, fixes penalties and pro
vides for the destruction of liquor
seized by officers of the law. Still an
other prohibits the manufacture or
sale of tulapai, tiswin or corn beer, b
Indians. Among the health measures :
may be mentioned the law abolishing j
the common towel and common drink
ing cup in all public places.
Divorced persons will be compelled
to wait for one year before remarrying
under a new law which goes into effect
June 12. While there has been -some
question as to whether the law would

date, it is generally taken that it will
Referendum Certain , Against noL As a resull tnt,re nas been noted
rpi j i D- a marked increase in the number Of di-
passed.
Important among the new laws
which take effect June 7 is that creat
ing the commission of state institu
tions. This new body is to be com
posed of three members, appointed by
the governor, and is to take over the
administrative functions of the boart
Of control, which is abolished by the
same measure. The new commission
will, however, have complete supervi
sion not only of the corrective and
penal institutions of the state, but also
of the educational institutions, includ
ing the State university. Another im
portant law is the widow's pension law,
which was passed in the last few min
utes of the session. It provides for
pensions of from $15 to $60 per month
for widows with dependent children
who have resided in Arizona for one
year.
Another 'measure .'that is of impor
tance to the people of the state is
that combining the offices Of county
and city assessor and county and city
tax collector. Under the provisions ol
this measure the office of city assessor
is abolished and the county assessor
also assesses the city taxes. The office
of city assessor and city tax collector
is abolished except in the cases of cit
ies operating under a 'special charter,
which may amend their charters so as
to conform with the new law if they
so desire.
Other laws which will shortly take
effect are the brokers' license bill,
which requires an annual license fee of
$200 from each brokerage hou.se oper
ating in the state and the filing of a
$5,000 tOnd; the bill providing ior the
establishment of free employment of
fices under the supervision of the com
mission of state institutions in co-oper
ation with the federal department . of
labor; the law forbidding the printing
of anonymous advertisements in con
nection with any initiated Or referred
measure of amendment to the const!
tution; a law providing a metnod for
the extermination of prairie dogs by
the various counties, and a law making
it possible for every county in the
state to hold a county fair once a year
if it bO desires. The last-named meas
ure carries an appropriation out ol
state funds of $1,000 for each county
that desires to hold such a fair.
Among the appropriations which
will be available immediately for state
buildings are $125,000 for an addition
to the state capitol building; $30,000
for a mining exhibit building at the
state fair grounds, and $7,000 for the
purchase Of the old guberantorial man
sion at Prescott. Other appropriations
for bridges in various parts of the
state carried the emergency clause
and are already being used.

furnish all their own bedding and the
necessary implements are required to
put in a certain numbe rof hours'
work on their plot of ground each day.

Inspiration Copper Company's subscription of $1,000,000 to 'the Liberty

different boards of directors meet .
In addition to thelif subscriptions to the Liberty Loan, the copper pro

NEW TDM REED

I
H C k r D U r
Dig Crusher Un Kich Oatman '
Property Is Now Handling
Close To 300 Tons of Ore i
Every Day.
OATMAN. Ariz., June 2. Without
any ceremonies, the new Tom .Reed
300-ton mill was set in motion Fri
day and is now engaged in crushing
and treating its rated capacity of ore
daily.
The first few days' run of a new
mill are naturally difficult ones, as
the macbiney is new and has to be
broken in to do its work properly.
But the three Allis-Chalmers granu
lating mills have been tested out and
worked for three or four weeks under
the supervision of Supt. M. Rabb, of
the Tom Reed Gold Mines Company,
and they are behaving very well.
These granulating mills are the
latest and supposedly the most im
proved production of the science of
reducing ore to such a degree of fine
ness as makes separation of the val
ues easiest. Hundreds of chrome
steel balls do the crushing as the
great cylinders revolve.
As the crushed ore comes out of the
first mill it goes through a classifier
that automatically sends the larger
portion back to be run through a sec
ond time, while that which has been
reduced to the required mesh goes
on to the next mill, to be ground still
finer. The same process is repeated
with the succeeding mills so that ab-
soultely uniform "slime" starts on its
Journey through the series of redwood
tanks, where eyanldation takes place
and filter presses finally separate the
gold nd silver from the tailings.
Change Is Successful.
While gold is the principal valu
able metal found In Oatman ores.
there is also a small yield in silver,
small in value though comparatively
large In volume.
The change from the old stamp and
tube mill to the modern ball granu
lating process was made without the
loss of a single minute's running time.

BUTTE. June 2. -The North Butte
Mining Company, which has been
prosecuting vigorously the develop

some months, has decided to sink its
new shaft in that district upon the
Sarsfield claim. The new shaft will
be sunk to a depth or 1.000 feet as its
first objective. The road to the Sars
field tunnel is being put into condi
tion and the tunnel itself will be re
paired, as from this tunnel near the
base of the hill will be sunk the shaft,
600 feet in deoth being thus gained.
The shaft will be raited from the
tunnel to the surface, this method
being considerably cheaper than sink
ing that distance.

an half-dozen shipping mines and the
development of at least four other
properties to the nearly-productive
stage. " '

ITS MONEY III
Government Establishes Smel
ters For Converting Cash
Into Copper, As Result of
Actions of Japanese.
The Chinese government has under
taken the establishment of smelters
for the purpose of melting cash into
copper and thus putting a stop to
. the enormous profits which have been
made lately by foreigners and private
individuals. .Owing 'to the copper in
cash being worth more than the cur
rency value of the coin) various com
panies, especially Japanese, have been
buying the hoarded cash of China,
turning them into commercial copper,
and exporting it to the belligerent
countries to be used in the manufac
ture of munitions. The rise in the
price of copper has been bo great and
the corresponding demand has been
so active, that it is estimated that
in the last six months Japanese deal
ers have imported copper from north
ern China alone at a profit of. $60,
,000,000 silver.
Recently a group of Chinese mer
chants,. known as the Paoli Syndicate,
obtained a lease from the government
permitting them to buy a quantity of
the cash, but the opposition through
out the country was so great iuat the
government withdrew permission and
will undertake the work itself. A
special body bas been formed with a
working capital of $10,000,000. or
which the .government will advance
$1,000,000, and allowance has been
made for a portion of the remainder
to be raised by private subscription.
Smelting plants will be built in Tien
tsin and other provinces, and, accord
ing to the Far Eastern Bureau, the
hoarding of cash to sell to Japanese
collectors and the smuggling of de
stroyed coins out of the country will
be stopped.

to go into the gulch. There will also
be a big department store building
and a number of residences, some of
which are to be located on ground

ATTACKS PERFECTED
United States Bureau of Mines
Promises To Play Important
Part In War; All Experts
Are Busy.
The United States Bureau of Mines
promises to play an important part in
the war, particularly for its devices
which will be used to protect soldiers
from gas attacks. Experts now are
at work designing an apparatus that
promises to be superior to any now
in use on the European battlefields.
The experts of the bureau. Dr. Yan
dell Henderson, professor of physi
ology in the Yale Medical school, and
J.-W. Paul, in charge of the -rescue
work of the Bureau of Mines, make
the statement that the wearing of
the present types of oxygen-rescue
apparatus involves grave danger, ow
ing to the fact that the makers have
as yet failed to meet satisfactorily
certain mechanical and physiological
apparatus and suggest ways in which;
these may be eliminated.
Of Great Value. v
"While this report is primarily of
Interest to the mining industry and is
meant as a measure for the improve
ment in the oxygen apparatus used
in saving life at mine disasters,' said
Van H. Manning, director of the bu
reau, "it comes at such a time as to
be of great value to the army and
navy in their need of apparatus to
protect the lives of their men in war
fare. "In the apparatus now being used
we have found a number of grave de
fects. As an instance of one of these
serious defects, the manufacturers of
such apparatus have directed that the
oxygen supply should be set at a ratej
sufficient for only moderate exertion
upon the part of the wearer. Because
of this, rescue crews have been trained
to walk slowly and to stop and rest
at frequent intervals. Moving slowly
might mean to be crushed and a vig
orous attempt to escape would result
in collapse or even asphyxiation be
cause of an insufficient supply of oxy
gen. For Work in Trenches.
"As the most effective means of put
ting into concrete form and of test
ing the feasibility or the recommenda
tions of this report, the bureau has
attempted to develop an apparatus
along the physiological lines for which
it calls. For some time W. E. Gibbs,
an experienced mechanical engineer,
has been -at work for the bureau on
this problem. Mr. Gibbs, aided by the
advice and co-operation of the authors
of this report, has produced an appa
ratus which. In experimental tests.
has shown Itself superior to the old
types, but which still has to be sub
jected to further tests in service. In
addition, Mr. Gibbs' services have
been tendered to the military forces
for the development of an apparatus
that will be of value in the trenches."

United Verde Extension Mining
Company, the copper sensation . of
1916. and which produced over 36,
000,000 pounds of topper in the first
twelve months of its active operation,
will again establish a new record in
1917.
The output has climbed to approx
imately ?.000,';00 pounds a month, or
at the rate of 60,000.000 pounds per
annum. Assuming a 7-cent cost last
year it averaged cents a pound
United Verde Extension at the pres
ent time must be showing earnings
of close to $1,000,000 a month, or $12,
000,000 per year, against $6,900,000
made in 1916. This would be equal
to almost $12 per share.
Ore shipments approximate 9,00f
; tons a month, averaging 18 per cent
i to 20 per cent copper. A large part
of it goes to the Copper Queen smel
ter of the Phelps Dodge Corporation.
Grading for the smelter site bas
been started and actual construction
work should commence within a few
i weeks. The smelter will cost about
! $2,500,000, and will be met from

ANACONDA IS MAKING
MANY IMPROVEMENTS
IN MINES AT BUTTE
New Hoists Put In Commis
sion At Pilot-Butte And
Alice Properties; Ore Bins
At Pennsylvania Enlarged.
BUTTE, June 2. New hoists have
been put in commission at the Pilot
Butte and the Alice properties of the
Anaconda Copper Mining Company.
The plant at the former can be oper
ated either with air or steam and is
of a capacity sufficient to operate to
a depth of 4,000 feet and can hoist
1,000 tons daily.
The Alice hoist will be capable of
lifting from 800 to 1.200 tons daily
and from this property the Anaconda
Company is looking to build up its
zinc ore tonnage, which thus far has
been somewhat disappointing. The
Pilot-Butte, in addition to its copper
ores, has several zinc fissures of
promise.
Ore bins at the Pennsylvania mine
of the Anaconda Company are being
enlarged from a capacity of 25 rail
road cars to 50. Mining operations
are being increased at the Ranis
mine, the ore from which is being
hoisted through the Pennsylvania
shaft. The tonnage from the Rarus
formerly was hoisted through the
Tramway shaft, which is not yet in
shape to permit of a resumption. It
had been expected to start this shaft
this week, but the task of retimbering
it, in consequence" of a recent fire,
probably will take another week.
The Anaconda Company has com
menced the reopening of the West
Nettie shaft, in the western part of
the Butte district. This shaft will af
ford a second workjng shaft for the j
Nettie mine, which is being operated
at the present time through the Phil

Binghamton' May Output
Farther to the south of the Copper
Lode company's ground, along the
same belt of mineralized schist, an in
creasing tonnage of ore is being mined
by the Arizona Binghamton and Cop
per Queen companies During tlio
month of May the Binghamton mill
turned out an average of 25 tons of
copper concentrates daily. The com
pany's copper matte returns for May
totaled approximately 320,000 pounds.
Thirty thousand pounds of this matte
represented ore from the Copper
Queen mine that was milled by the
Arizona Binghamton 'company.
The ore production from the Bing
hamton mine during May was drawn
from No. 105 deposit on the second
level and from No. 102 deposit on the
third level during the ordinary course
of development work. Sloping has
been started in No. 91 ore body on
the fourth level in No. 101 ore body on
the first level, in No. 108 ore body on
the third level and in No. 105 ore body
on the second level. The drift north
in the new ore body recently discover
ed on the fourth level has a length of
100 feet at this writing. The ore is
breaking an average of 14 per cent
copper. There is a 6-foot section of
gray copper .and chalcopyrite that,
samples well above 20 per cent cop
per. Loma And Jerome Showing.
Nearby the Binghamton and Copper
Queen mines are located the holdings
of the Loma Verde Copper company,
and a portion of the holdings of the
Jerome Copper company. Homer
King COD8uUing engineer, and A. U
Johns, engineer in charge of mining
operations for the last mentioned, vis
ited the holdings near the Binghamton
mine a few days ago and laid out
plans for development. The copper
showing at surface and nominal depth
on this ground, and on the Lone Pine
group of the Loma Verde company, is
one of the most' promising in Yavapai
county, outside of the productive area
at Jerome. Early in June the main
workings on the Lone Pine are to be
unwatered and mining research re
sumed in the commercially valuable
copper ore bodies opened in past
years. In the meantime camp build
ings and mine machinery are being
overhauled and renovated.
A. Cj Cole, superintendent of the
Great Western Smelter at Mayer, is
increasing the capacity of that plant
by adding a 500 ton unit, which will
give it a total capacity of 700 tons of
ore daily. It is repoted that the
smelter is turning out a 45 per cent
copper matte which also carries a gold
content of $S0 per ton. The increase
in capacity is made mandatory by the
development of the ore bodies in the,
Henrietta and Butternut mines of the!
Big Ledge company, and by mineral-'
ogical conditions at the Gopher, Sterl
ing and other properties owned by that;
company All of the machinery and
other materials necessary for enlarg-j
ing the smelter have arrived and are
beng installed. Mr. Cole brings toj
the management of the plant a wealtii ,
of experience gained as superintendent
; of the Cananea Copper company's'
j smelter. To facilitate ore shipments
from the Butternut mine an aerial
tram is at once to be constructed to
the tracks of the Prescott & Crown
King railway. i
Big Reef Has Flux Ore.
Dell Riggins, managing Sirector of
the Big Reef Copper company, field,
man for the Big Ledge Copper coni-j
pany, and owner of a large block of;
Big Ledge shares, reports the discov-'
ery of a well mineralized body of chal-:
copyrite ore at a depth of 60 feet in
the main shaft on the Big Reef estate, j
The property Is located in the vicinity
of the Henrietta and Butternut mines,'
and is not far distant from the Bins-'
hamton and Copper Queen mines. The '
ore is similar in character to that be-
ing mined in the workings mentioned
and carries a copper content as hig'u
as 10 per cent per ton. At surface
and shallow depth, in various open
outs and tunnels, copper ore is ex
posed that has commercial value as
a flux. Shipments will be made to
the smelter at Mayer as soon as the,
additions thereto are completed.

Brilliant Colors Vie With Each Other j
For Suprefnacy In New Garments
Khaki Kool is famed for suits and
coats for summer wear.
Another summer surprise straw
hats are trimmed with fur.
Old rose medallions embroidered "in
Persian designs and colors are slipped
on gold and turquoise blue gros-grain
ribbon. There are four medallions to
the yard and they make a pretty band
for the hat.
New jewelry is truly oriental In de
sign and make-up, bright gold, gold of
a greenish tint set with bright col
ored jewels in a most pleasing man
ner. The most advanced fashion demand
in millinery is the combination of
black velvet and satin with white mi
lan. leghorn and crepe. One silk vel
vet brim is crowned with milan. The
bow of black velvet ribbon holds a
luscious bunch of cherries in place.
There has been a cry for light
weight fabrics that will withstand the
wear and tear or every day use. Silk,
in its many attractive weaves, is the
answer. This material has always been
associated with dressy frocks and
suits, but at the present it is being
widely used for morning frocks and
garments Tor sport wear.
Plaid 'skirts with blue jackets and
white vests are being much worn and
are considered very smart
Never has there been a reason when
beads played such an important part
in fashion. They are used on every
thing that has any connection with
women's wardrobe.
Your pongee dress may be in bold
or subdued stripe effect or solid color.
The solid color is a good width, mate
rial being 36 inches while the stripe is
only 32 inches.
As popular as ever, georgette crepe
may be secured In all the new colors
of spring, including white, walnut,
beige and Copenhagen blue.
So many frocks are collarless this
season. One model in this class is
the biscuit-colored crepe de chine, the
neck-line of which is finished with a
beaded band of ribbon. The ribbon Is
used also to form straps falling over
the shoulders gracefully and down the
front and back of the bodice. The rib
bon effect Is carried out by clever plac
ing of the beads on the deep girdle, at
the top of the hem and on the sdes of
the skirt A deep tuck gives a jacket
effect that is good.
Ko matter what material or what
trimming you select for your after
noon gown, bear in mind the fact that
the gown must he of a more elaborate
character than heretofore.
The new shade of green Is the Cos
sack Green.
. Decidedly smart and practical are
suits of faille, Yo San, Khaki Kool and
Sueding. They are to be had in many
neutral tones, ranging from putty to
bright tan, the different tones or gray
and blue. Ko color can usurp the
popularity or blue. Among the bright
er hues are jade, apple, lettuce, kelly
and grass green, cherry, tomato and
Egyptian red. bishop purple, terra cot
ta, gold and pumpkin yellow. (
Everywhere one looks one sees un
usual designs brought out in silks,
wool, chenilles, beads, and straw on
hats or varfous shapes. Don't forget
to introduce a touch of Mac's some
where on your design if you want it to
be a decided success. The design- you
choose may be embroidered directly on
the hat or it may be worked in a piece
of fabric and this can then be ap-
pliqued onto the bat. '
NOse veils are being worn by the
June brides. '
An ingenious use of beads has been
made in dark blue chiffon. Here many
colored grains are arranged to simu
late a Scotch plaid. As If this effort
were not enough to place the model
in the front ranks of lashion, it has an
odd and entirely different sleeve, the
back or which has been slashed near
the cuff and allows, in a graceful man
ner, a sash of dark blue satin, weighted
with bed tassels, to encircle the body
twice. The satin is repeated in the
band defining the neck line.
There is a surprise in store for the
tourists woh are considering the prac
tical things for touring use. Overalls of
khaki are to be worn under trench
coats of the same material, with linen
shirts or the same color and btack win
sor ties. Or course, the overalls have
a special cut all their own and are full.
like riding breeches. They are pro
nounced just the thing tor a touring
camper.
Blue chambray, with white collar
and white smoking, make a pretty
dress for the small girl.
Smart extra coats are shown in a

and belted with a buttoned strap. The

At th ebottom of the front there are

DOUGLAS, ARIZONA.
JUST NOT MINIMIZE!
RESPONSIBILITY OF
II
Prominent Americans, In
- Starting Movement For Big
Red Cross Fund, Voice
Danger of People's Unreal
ization. '
Ex-President Taft, Secretary Bak
er, General Pershing, Henry P. Dav
ison, and other speakers. Joined in
New York several days ago at a
meeting of the Red Cross, which has
on foot a campaign to raise $100,000,
000, in telling the American people
that there was 'grave danger in the
tendency to minimize the responsibil
ity the United States must assume
and the hardships and sacrifices and
people must accept, if the war was to
be pushed to a successful conclusion.
Mr. Taft sounded the warning that
America has not yet come to a reali
zation of the dreadful dangers and the
hardships it faced, and to this Gener
al Pershing, who will lead the first
expeditionary force to France, added
the grim statement that "Upon Amer
ica is to rest the brunt of the terrible
burdens to come."
"France" he said, "is under a ter
rific drain, and in just so much as
that nation is drained is she weaken
ed in her power to fight, and it is the
United States which must meet all of
the deficiencies caused through this
drain. We of this country must help
rehabilitate that country. We must
help her orphans and her widows and
we must put her in a position to pro
duce, and to become self-supporting.
"Yet I am sad to say that the feel
ing among our American people is lax.
They do not realize the depth, the ter
rlbleness of this war. America's en
tering the war is the deciding factor,
and on the United States is going to
rest the brunt of its burdens."
General Pershing was cheered for
several minutes when he appeared in
the hall,. In response to the ovation,
he said:
"These things bring the soldier to
remember that the people back home
are. behind him. You don't know
what that means to a soldier. It will
mean a great deal to those of us who
are in France."
Nothing But Victory, Say Baker.
Secretary Baker said that the Unit
ed States had entered the war in the
the firm belief of victory for right
and had not the slightest intention of
stopping until the victory was achiev
ed. In his address, Mr. Taft said that
the American Red Cross henceforth
would devote Its energies to the relief
of the soldiers of the- Allies, although
ready to give the same care to sol
diers of the enemy who, . wounded, J
came into its hands. He then began
a review of the war and the attitude!
of the American people to it. in
part he said:
"I yield to no man in my admiration
for most of the qualities or all of the
qualities of the German people except
this obsession that they have been
given through the instilling of that
poison in the last fifty yeas. Wher
do you see the working out of the di
vine plan? That was a cancer in the
world. It has grown to be so formid
able that it needed a capital opera
tion to excise it and restore the world

So we have seen it in the destruction
of the greatest autocracy, perhaps
at least apparently the greatest au
ocracy, Russia, whose alliance with the
Entfjite Allies gave for the time the
lie, to the proposal that they were
fighting the cause of freedom against
absolutism. That toppled over, and
how we have arrayed on one side the
democracies of the world against the
military autocracies on the other.

'We will starve England into submis

the accomplishment of that she forc

ranks of her enemies, at a time when
(his war is to be determined by mon
ey, by resources, and by men, the
nation that can furnish more money,
more resources, more equipment and
more men than any nation in the
world.
Not to Minimize the Task.
"And now, my friends, do not let us
minimize the task we have before us.
We Americans are a good people; we
admit it, but one 'of our weaknesses
is an assumption justified by a good
many things that have saved us from
egregious mistakes in the past that
God looks after children, drunken men
and the United States.
"We may have got beyond that re
liance; I do not know whether we
have or not, but we are going to get
beyond that reliance. Germany is not
exhausted. She is, by reason of this'
system of fifty years' standing, the
greatest military nation that ever was
organized, and she still has great
fighting power; and she arrayed our
selves as he enemy because, with that
devotion to system, with that failure
to understand the influence of moral
force in a people, she was contemp
tuous of what we, who had ignored
military preparation, could do in this
war. That she has now made an
Egregious error it is for us to show.
When we went into this war there
were a good many people who thought
all we had to do was draw a check
or several checks for a billion dollars
and that "George" would do the fight
ing. This is not the case.
"One of the things which has hap
pened ought to give us the greatest
hope and satisfaction. It Is largely
due to the gentleman who has just ad
dressed us, the Secretary of War, and
the President of this Administration.
We have provided for a million or per
haps a million and a half of men. That
will probably not be enough. A great
deal better than we should make over
preparation in a matter In which the
whole welfare of the world is engag
ed, than that we should make under
preparation.
"What has been said I only wish to
repeat, and that is while we can intel
lectually perhaps visualize the war, if
in our hearts feel it is something
apart from us.
"I read the other day "Mr. Bhitiing
Sees It Through," and studied the
nhycholocical development of the coin
in? of the war to bim. That is what
we havr. got to do. We shall not real
ize what the war Ik until our men,
tvoFe beloved with us, have been ex
rosed to the dreadful dangers, to the
character of wounding that Is so hor
rible under this modern system of
wr-fare; and until we all go to the
bulletins end study the names to see
whether those who are near and dear
to us have taken for their country's
sake. Then the war will come in to
us. Then there will be nothing but
the war. and everything else will be
incidental; and until that psychologi
cal change has come, we shall not fret
the whole nieasure of our duty as we
n'ust feel in order to carry this war
through." : '
War Not Yet Realized.
Mr. Davidson made this comment:
"Our great trouble today is that our
people do not realize the situation in
the battlefields aud throughout the
countries now at war. It is not at all
strange that they do not realize them,
bu they must be 'made to realize them
and the obligation upon us is to see
that condition is brought about as
soon as possible.
"Certainly there is nothing that thia
people need more than a senue of sacrifice.-
This is not a time to listen to
the man who says, 'I am contributing
so much here and so much there, taxes
are very high and the cost of Mving
is high.
"Russia today has 6,000 ambulances
on front of 1.000 miles. In France
there are 64,000 ambulances on a
front of 400 miles. We are going to
going to allow conditions like that to
exist and not respond to them prompt
ly? I say no. We had when we start
ed 22,000 members. We have today,
I believe, in excess or 1.000,000 mem
bers. We should have in two months
20,000,000 members."
Robert C. Hoover stated that there
was a total of 3,000,000 people "un
able to get back on their feet" with
out help. In France, he said, there
was abundant outlet to all of the gen
erosity of the American nation. Mr.
Hoover was introduced as "the man of
the hour," and received a hearty wel
come. In a proclamation to the American
people President Wilson today desig
nated the week ending June 25 as Red
Cross Week and urged that during the
period generous gifts be made to as
sist the organization in properly car
ing for the armed forces of the nation
and the administration of relief. It
follows:
PROCLAMATION.
Inasmuch as our thoughts as a na
tion are now turned in united purpose
toward the performance to the ut
most of the services and duties which
we have assumed in the cause of jus
tice and liberty;
Inasmuch as but a small proportion
of our people can have the opportun
ity to serve upon the -actual field of
battle, but all men, women and chil
dren alike may serve and serve effec
tively by making it possible to ctre
properly for those who do serve un
der arms at home and abroad.
And Inasmuch as the American Red
Cross is the official recognized agency
for voluntary effort ii behalf of the
armed forces of the nation and for
the administration of relie?.
Now, therefore, by virtue of my au
thority as President of the Tnited
States and President of the American
Red Cross, I, Woodrov Wilson, do
hereby proclaim the week ending on
June 25, 1917, as Red Cross Week,
during which the people of the United
States will be called upon to give
generously and in a spirit of patriotic
sacrifice for the support and mainten
ance of this work of national need.

The Studebaker Car
Economy is a Factor
Ei CONOMY is simply wise buying.
It does not mean unnecessary sacrifice.
Economy is the very opposite of hoarding.
For the very term "economy" presupjwses the
purchase of necessities, of conveniences, of those
things that make for business and personal
efficiency. .
Automobiles are necessities with many of us
professional men find them well-nigh indispens
able. Salesmen in various lines of business often find
their efficiency greatly enhanced by the use of a
motor car.
To the family it means health, strength and
added vigor it means increased happiness.
Anything that means all this is an economy.
Therefore, the question is one of what auto
mobile to buy.
Studebaker is the largest producer of fine auto
mobiles in the world.'
Studebaker's great resources, Studebaker's great
volume enable Studebaker to produce a better
car at a lower price.
For this reason Studebaker cars are probably
the greatest values on the automobile market
today, dollar for dollar of their prices.
The Studebaker FOUR is the only 40 Horse
Power, Four Cylinder, Seven Passenger car
selling for less than $1,000.
The Studebaker SIX is the only 50 Horse
Power, Six Cylinder, Seven Passenger car selling
for less than "$1,500.
In ratio to power Studebaker cars are very
economical in their consumption of gasoline.
In ratio to weight and carrying capacity, they
are very economical in tires Studebaker owners
frequently get from 8,000 to 10,000 miles on a
single set of tires.
Studied accessibility reduces adjustment and
repair costs to a minimum.
Studebaker's nation-wide organization of thirty
two direct branches and 6,500 dealers, assures
your permanent service satisfaction.
Therefore, economy being a factor if you want
to buy wisely and well, it will pay you to in
vestigate Studebaker before you decide what car
to buy. '

Bisbee , High School Ranks
With the Best Preparatory
Institutions In the Nation
That the Bisbee High School has
been accredited membership in The
North Central Association of Colleges
and Secondary Schools is a matter
for congratulation and "civic pride.
Just what this membership means can
be realized only by acquaintance with
the principles, ideals and standards
of the association.
The association is beyond all doubt
the most generally recognized stand
ardizing' educational agency in the en-!
tire United States. Its prestige is that
of first rank.
Among the many aims of this asso
ciation, of colleges and secondard
schools are those of providing co-operation
of .considering common prob
lems, of promoting the well-being of
students and higher standards of
scholarship and -teaching force.
Honor For School.
It Ista distinct honor for any school
to hold relationship with this body.
The association's official recognition
gives prestige to a school among edu-j
cated nen and women everywhere.;
Its approval is a letter of introduction ,
to all colleges universities, and profes
sional schools in the land, and guar
antees efficiency and high standing to
these institutions. Accredited rela
tions with the association bring to a
secondary school the same distinction
and honor of an institution that mem-

Xi confers upon an individual or that! ?lle'

brings. to a firm in. business. More-
over, membership hi the association!
aids boards of education to secure bet
ter prepared teachers, to erect bar
riers against untrained teachers, and
in general to raise higher educational
standards.
School Should Be Proud.
The standards of qualification re
quired by the association are numer
ous. They are rigid and conservative.
To have fulfilled these standards, and
especially to have become accepted on
the first application is something of
which the Bisbee High School may be
proud.
Among the standards relating to
teachers of academic subjects are the
minimum attainment of graduation
from a standard college of four years
in advance of the standard four-year
high school also that the professional
training of such teachers shall be at
least eleven semister hours in Edu
cation.
For the information of the com-(
munity and school patrons a brief j

That a high standard of work has
been maintained by Bisbee High is
shown in part by the recognition given
to its graduates who have entered var

who have entered upon higher 'school

Variety of Course.
The unusual variety of choice and
election in the groups of courses in
Bisbee High affords opportunities els
dom found except in schools which are
much larger. The surricula fall into

how they came to possess so much

was that three steamers had been

SYNOPSIS.
Anticipating the threatened Japanese
Mexican invasion of the Southwestern
Siatee, Patria Channing, an American
Girl of sreat wealth, with the assistance
of her fiance, Capt. Donald Parr (late U.
S. A.), converts her vast border ranch
lands into what is virtually "an armed
camp." Baron Huroki, commanding the al
lied Japanese-Mexican forces, learns of
1 'atria preparations, and thinking to nip
them in the bud, orders his troops to at
tack in force.
FIFTEENTH EPISODE
The Sting of Victory.
DARK HOURS.
It was shortly after sunrise when the
first -shots' signaled the attempt of
Patria Channlng's little handful of pa
triotic adventurers to stem the Inva-
sion of American soil by the allied
force of Mexicans and Japanese com-1 cloud of rough-riding plainsmen un
manded by Baron Huroki. I der the leadership of Rodman Pills-
Pa tria's first move, then, was to dls
patch telegrams to the nearest post of
the United States army as well as to
Washington, giving notice of the Inva
sion and asking for help.
Within an hour. Japanese field bat
teries, shelling with shrapnel the ad
vanced trenches which commanded the
international boundary line, had ren
dered them untenable and Japanese
infantry had swarmed over them in
pursuit of the retreating defenders.
At the same time Baron Huroki and
his staff, taking possession of Patria's
hacienda, had converted It Into field
headquarters. From Its patio Huroki
directed the efforts of his troops to
overcome the resistance of the de
fenders. '
The latter had meanwhile occupied
their main intrenchments, a far strong
er 'position furrowing the ridge of a
range of low hills lying back of the j
hacienda and something slightly less
than a mile north of the border line. .
Here they took root stubbornly. De- j
spite the disparity between their num
bers and those of the invaders, they
threw back charge after charge of i
Japanese And Mexican infantry, with
ering and blasting them with the machine-gun
fire which sprayed the ter- j
rain with death as a garden hose
sprays a lawn with life; while their
batteries, cunningly secreted back of
the hills and directed in masterly fash
Ion, kept the guns of the invaders too
busily on the move to permit their do- j
mg inucn aamage to tne trencnes.
But if the defenders fought with un
shukable determination and fearless
ness, they foughr with despair in their
hearts. For their commanding eleva
tion permitted them to overlook all
the land between them and the bound
ary, and they could hardly help being
appalled by the flood of allied troops
which was sweeping across the bor
der and arraying against them.
Again urgent prayers for aid were
dispatched to the authorities.
As before, they gained no acknowl
edgment of any sort.
Failing to ' take the main line
trenches by assault, Huroki ordered
his forces to fall back and dig them-

selves in which they did with trained
expedition and efficiency, throwing up
a line of intrenchments roughly par
alleling those on the hlllcrest
And their batteries, presently finding
shelter, rained shells upon the Ameri
cans to keep down their fire, until Pa
tria's guns again searched them out;
when the battle passed Into a tempo
rary phase of big gun dueling, and the
Infantry had a little time to breathe
and take account of its losses.
These last proved astonishingly
slight, but none the less terrible In Pa
tria's understanding. Already the field
hospital accommodations which she
had provided were overcrowded ntid

slstants- and nurses overworked,
the day was still young.
And
Donald Parr attempted to comfort
her with the assurance that their po
sitions were so strong they could hold
out another 2 hours, If required
by which time help must surely
have come to them from the regular
army and the National Guurd which
had been mobilized for border duty.
Against this argument there re
mained the unquestionable fact the'
repeated telegrams evoked no re
sponse from any quarter.
And re-enforcements at any time
would arrive too late to prevent hide
ous mortality in the ranks of the do-
fenders.
Toward mid-morning a second series
of most violent assaults was launched
against the main-line trenches, and
thoiyrh each In turn was thrown back
severely pjnished, each took its toll of
American lives and by so much lessen
ed the ability to present Impregnable
resistance,
But by noon Huroki , seems to
have made up his mind that further ef
forts to take the trenches by storm
were futile. There fell a lull in the
fury of the combat between the in
fantry forces, while a flanking move
ment on the part of the Mexican cav
alry was met and confronted by a
bury.
Then again the artillery duel was
resumed; but there was in this some
thing strangely perfunctory, as far
at least as the work of the allied gun
ners were concerned. The suspicion
was warranted, and by subsequent
events was borne out, that Huroki was
sparring for time.
He was awaiting the arrival of heav
ier artillery; whatever those circum
stances were which delayed Its com
ing with effective range till dusk of
evening, they alone saved Patria's
forces from annihilation though much
credit is due to the scouts of Patria's
flying corps for the willingness and skill
with which they engaged the Japanese
aviators and drove them from the
sky above the American positions, pre
venting their locating the hidden bat
teries.
The last traces of light were dying
from the sky when Hurokl's heaviest
metal came Into action.
Simultaneously new and extraor
dinarily vicious assaults were made
upon the trenches. ,
And still no word from Washing
ton or from any other quarter to
which appeals had been telegraphed!
It was not tin midnight that a
scouting party dispatched by Donald
Parr brought in an explanation of this
ostensible Indifference on the part of
the authorities to the fate of Patria's
devoted little band.
Then It appeared that the wires had
h mt h- TnnflneS4, sr,ies. who had
mes-
sages dispatched by'Patria's field head
quarters, in such manner as complete
ly to deceive her telegraph operators.
In short, it transpired that not one
of those many frantic cries for help
had been Jheard but by enemy ears.
Throughout a night of hopeless hor
ror the battle raged. From the mo
ment when Hurokl's great guns en
tered Into the contest there was scarce
ly a single perceptible break In the
succession of assaults upon the
trenches till dawn broke upon their
desperately thinned ranks.
And with the dawn came the final
effort, a charge In force that taxed to
the utmost the courage, resource and
Ingenuity of the Americans. That
It broke and was swept back can be
counted as nothing short of miracu
lous. As it did so, Donald Parr fell, his
shoulder shattered by shrapneL
When be recovered consciousness
In her arms, and she knew that his
hurt was not mortal, Patria took into
her own hands the command which
she bad resigned to his. Conferring
by telephone in person with her staff,
she ordered the effort of the last re
sort, the forlorn hope which had been
reserved for that moment when the
day seemed lost and sacrifice of self
alone might stem the tide of defeat
All defensive tactics were abandoned.
The men were ordered from the
trenches, to advance, to charge and
keep on charging till the last man fell.
To give them heart a fleet' of "tanks"
armored caterpillar tractors carrying
machine-gun crews were loosed upon
the enemy.
Looming through the gray, formlesi
light of the new-born day like mon
strous armadllloes vomiting fire and
death, they crossed their own trenches
and met and broke a charge of Japa
nese and Mexican Infantry, scattering
it like chaff.
As the enemy turned and fled these
terrors the Americans forsook the
shelter of their trenches and pursued.
At the same time masked batteries
came out of hiding and moved forward
to closer positions in the open.
A daring raid of cavalry captured a
42-centimeter howitzer and turned It
upon Its own people.
Where the tanks were not, there was
hand-to-hand fighting characterized by
the grlmest determination on both
sides. But wherever the tanks
moved and nothing served to swerve
one of these from whatever course It
chose to take the ranks of the enemy
melted Into disorderly rabble of puuie
stricken fugitives. ' ,
A shell from the howitzer found the
Channing hacienda and laid it in
flaming, smoking ruins about the ears
of Huroki and his staff.
Thirty minutes after the- tanks had
Inaugurated the offensive, the luvu- i
sion had been turned into a rout. The
roads beyond the border were choked
with fugitives, Huroki and his per-
sonal aides forced their armored motor-
car through the milling mob upon the
bridge at the border and regained
Mexican soil a bare minute before an
other howitzer shell destroyed the
bridge utterly, and with it hundreds of
fleeing Mexicans and Japanese.
The last action of the battle was an
engagement between American rough
riders and Mexicnn cavalry. In which
the latter, attempting to cover the rear
of the defeated army, were vanquished,
dissipated, sent scurrying into the
south in disorder as great as that of
their comrades and allies whom they
had sought to save.
But in this engagement Rodman
Pillsbury fell, killed Instantly in ac
tion. Ordering her batteries up to the
boundary line, Patria instructed them
to shell the fugitives mercilessly. Fur
ther than this line she would not per
mit them to move. Nor would she per
mit one of her decimated little army
to carry the war into Mexico.
In defending her own property
against aggression she had acted with
in her rights as a private citizen. If
reprisals were to be visited upon the
aggressors, that was the prerogative
of the government of her country not
her prerogative.
Thus the Invading army of Baron
Huroki and his dupes and allies melt
ed away into those sun-baked plains
and arid hills of Mexico, and was no
more like the army of a dream.

In the heat of that breathless after
noon the armored motorcar, a grim
gray unit of mechanism rendered only
the more grim and gray by its heavy
coating of dust and the evidences of
ard usage It wore, lunged' heav
ily around the wide curves of the
military road penetrating the secret
heart of those Mexican mountains, de
bouched on a downgrade with the !

swiftness of an angel of death Into
the great valley devoted to the allied
encampment, and drew up sharply, as
If checked by some invisible but Im-1
movalSe barrier, before the adobe
building dedicated to the uses of the
commander In chief and his staff.
Half a dozen men, worn, haggard, si
lent, in uniforms stiff with sweat and
dust, alighted from the car and weari
ly threw themselves, rather than
walked, up the step to the veranda
In front of the headquarters building.
Deepest disconsolutlon was the key
note of their common demeanor.
In the lines that furrowed their dust
masked faces, in those red-rimmed
eyes which stared out of them, despair
was written plainly the despair of
gamblers who have staked nil on a
single throw and have lost.
Foremost in their number was Baron
Huroki, that arch-conspirator, that
gambler incurable a presence of com
manding distinction even in the shad
ow of defeat, disgrace, and death.
At his heels moved his shadow, that
one whose devotion and loyalty to his
master passed even that devotion and
loyalty which was the due of his em
peror Hurokl's aid de camp of today,
his body servant of yesterday, his fa
miliar spirit of all days, that Japanese
who answered to the name of Kato.
Their four companions were officers
of high rank, subordinate only to the
commander In chief of the army which
Japan had thrown into Mexico to co
operate with the native troops In that
"great drive" designed to split the
United States asunder by Invading the
Mississippi valley via the Southwest-!
ern states, leaving the Pacific slope de I
fcnseless against Invasion by way of j
Lower California and the sea. i
As Huroki moved toward the door of
the adobe building, a Japanese orderly
came out, paused, saluted stiffly, with
a countenance expressionless, nnd
proffered a folded paper. I
; Huroki recognized the form on I
.which incoming telegraphic dispatches
were transcribed. He could have
hazarded a shrewd mess at the na
ture of this comirmnlcation if put
to it, could have foretold It t almost
word for word.
None the less he extended a steady
hand to accept It, unfolded the paper,
read It without permitting the slight
est phase of his emotions to be re
flected in his face, and deliberately re
folded 1L

mnniipd the wandering Interest of his
racked staff with a siuglf glance, his

they stiffened to attention.
After a moment he addressed tliera
in u level and toneless voice, with
the manner of one Imparting informa
tion concerning a person of particular
unimportance.
"Gentlemen," said Baron Huroki, "it
becomes my duty to Impart to you cer
tain advices. I have re a message
from his majesty, the emperor."
He paused to make obeisance to the
effigy symbolized by that name.
"I need hardly remind you that, up
on the untimely death, day before yes
terday, of the late commander in chief.
Count Nogi, I. acting ou authority
vested in me by his imperial majesty,
assumed the functions of commander
in chief, and in my supreme discretion
initiated that Invasion of the United
States which was the ultimate pur
pose of our presence In Mexico. For
this action I assumed, professed, and
accept fuil responsibility.
' "That my action was Ill-advised is
beside the point. I alone was. and am.
liable for Its consequences. The onus
of failure rests upon a single head,
my own.
"By my lack of sownd judgment, my
haste and rashness, I have brought
down defeat upon our forces, I have
needlessly sacrificed unnumbered fel
low servants of his majesty, the em
peror, I have wrought confusion with
his imperial designs, I have set ut
naught his ends.
"So be It. I explain without attempt
to extenuate the consequences of my
madness. I accept without . protest
the penalty of failure.
"The command of our scattered and
shattered forces I resign to your
capable hands. Ton are Instructed
to reorganize them as quickly as
possible and withdraw from this
part of Mexico, marching westwards
to effect a junction with the army en
camped at Magdalena Bay. This you
will do not ouly with all possible ex
pedition, but with all feasible secrecy.

would like my dishonored body to be

"Gentlemen, I "go to join my fore

salute returned, he executed an about
face and strode Into the adobe build
lng. t .
After him went Kato.
For an hour he sat in the office of
the commander in chief, industriously,
methodically putting In order all his
affairs, official as well as personal.
When there was no more to do, he
rose without hesitation, and, strode in
to the adjoining room, which had been
his sleeping quarters.
Here Kato was awaiting him Kato
translated from the trim and soldierly
aide in the field uniform of the Japa
nese army Into a figure that might
have been conjured from some Japa
nese print, a servile, fawning, obse
quious figure In the robes of his race
uud humble caste.
Upo the plain canvas cot which
had been Hurokl's bed were laid out
the magnificently embroidered robes
of a Samurai.
Beside the cot stood the steel trunk
which had contained these robes, and
which for many years had formed an
essential adjunct to Hurokl's travel
ing gear.
Assisted deftly by Kato, Baron Hu
roki divested himself of his soldier's
clothing, bathed and dressed In the
robes of his nobility.
Throughout neither uttered a single
word.
And in silence Huroki turned and
entered the room beyond, leaving his
footwear at the threshold.
The door closed behind him. On its
other side Kato, the Imperturbable,
knelt and ground his forehead Into
the dust of the floor.
In one stride Baron nurokl had
passed from Mexico to Nippon. Paper
screens masked the earthen walls ami
the thatched roof of the room. The
floor was covered with a clean white
cloth. In the middle of it rested a
small rug of glowing, sanguinary scar
let. At the edge of this small rug
was a low stand on which rested a
jeweled dagger In a Jeweled sheath.
Kneeling on the rug. Baron Huroki
swiftly denuded his body to the waist.
Then taking up the dagger and draw
ing it from Its sheath he tested Its
edge and point upon the thumbnail.
Satisfied, he held the dagger be
fore him on his two hands, outstretch
ed, open palms uppermost ; Jfiid In this
posture remained motionless for many
minutes, his grave. Intelligent eyes
fixed in meditation upon a point, or
scene, or memory, thousands of miles

i There was neither hesitation nor

He would have been glud of a long
er life if tiiat permitted him to repair
the errors of which he had been guilty.
But he had hud his chance, and had
failed.
What must be. must.
With a sudden, swift turn of his

THE COST.
When Patria appeared In the door
way the nurse rose and with a friend
ly and reassuring smile slipped out of
the room.
Donald Parr lay moveless on his
cot, asleep. The girl sat down on the
chair by his side and gently dropped
her hand upon one of his that lay
outside the sheet, a dark, strong hand
that seemed. In her sight, to dwarf
and render altogether puny and In
significant the slender white grace of
her own.
Still Donald did not stir. She was
content with that Sleep was what
he needed, the best of all medicines
for his hurts. She asked for herself
no more than this, that she be mr-
milted to rest a little by his side, to '
touch hi hand, to know that, though
his wounds were grievous, he would
live.- and In a day to crime be whole
and sound once more and hers.
She was very weary. The need to
rest oppressed her like a heavy bur-
I den. Yet she did not dream of clos
ing her eyes in sleep. She had too
much to think about, the victory of
the day to contemplate, its cost to
reckon. Her brain seemed to bnrn
with thoughts, doubts, fears, regrets,
memories; the screen of Its vision re
flected in endless succession flushing
scenes from the splendid, awful
pageant of that day and night of
fighting.
It was three o'clock In the after
noon. The last shot at the routed and
fleeing armies of invasion had. been
fired hours ago. The last fugitive had
long since disappeared. The last
stricken horse had been killed, the lust
wounded man had been found and
cared for. the last dead man burict
Remained only the stricken flel-L
bloodied and defiled and trampled and
furrowed almost beyond recognition ;
the consciousness that the day was
won, the Invader disastrously defeat
ed, the country saved In spite of It-
! self; the bitterness of victory.
j Sitting there In that close little room
I that reeked of Iodoform, with hor
hands touching the hand of her be
loved, the girl abandoned herself to
reverie, her dark eyes fathoming im
measurable depths of thought
Unconsciously she began to con the
toll of victory: Donald wounded nih
unto death, Boduiun Pillsbury nnd
Bud Morgan dead and these but the
beginning, names that headed the hun
dreds upon the lists of casualties
merely because they were most inti
mate to Patria ; the hacienda wrecked
beyond repair, the fair countryside
that surrounded it turned into a stink
ing shambles, a great treasure expend
ed in ammunition and the business of
war.
And all to what end?
She foresaw quite clenrly what
Touchy People.
Beware of touchy people! There
are always some about, ready to pester
you in some way. Hurry on past, so
you cannot hear them, and above all,
refuse deny what they say. Just
keep sweet and go ahead, nnd let their
unkind words swelter in the gloaming.
How much time and patience are wast
ed on touchy peofie. And yet su h
people think they, are the salt of thej
earth and everybody else dirty water.
It Is a real wlcketlness to be touchy.
It Is as bud as lying and cheating.
It docs the world as much harm. It
spoils more religion than swearing. If
you find a touchy person in your
I church, turn him out as soon as'pos
