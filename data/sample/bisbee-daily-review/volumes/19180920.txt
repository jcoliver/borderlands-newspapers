UNDATED WAR LEAD, BY ASSO
CIATED PRESS. Thursday saw both
the British and French armies in Pi
cardy materially develop their' plans
for the eventual enveloping of St.
Quentine and Cambrai. The British
made further gains around Gouzea
court and east of Epehy, while the
French striking southeast cf St. Quen
tin, brought the southern part of their
nipper into a better position for the
squeeze against the town, which daily
seemingly is growing nearer.
More than 10,000 prisoners and in
excess of sixty large guns fell into the
hands of the British during the big
operation begun by Field Marshal
Haig Wednesday northwest of St.
Quentin. In addition, extremely heavy
casualties were inflicted on the Ger
mans in the frontal attacks and dur
ing violent counter attacks made by
them in an endeavor to recoup their i
losses of ground. So badly was. the !
enemy hammered during this fight-1
ing that he did not attempt on Thurs-1
day to stir from his trenches, except I
near Epehy and Gouzeacourt and to I
give listless battle on isolated sectors
to the south.
Northeast of Soissons the Germans
are counter a tacking vigorously
against the allied forces holding
strategic positions which are threaten
ing the high ground along the Cheniin
Des Dames, which the enemy hopes
to save as a temporary haven of ref
uge in the event of a forced retire
ment from the west and the soutu.
Notwithstanding the strength of the
onslaughts, the French everywhere
repulsed the enemy.
Likewise south of the Alsne, in the
region of Courland, the Germans en
deavored to beat back the French, but
again met with defeat, the French ar
tillery cutting the attacking waves to
pieces. ,
On the Lorraine front there has
been considerable mutual artillery !
shelling, but no infantry engagements. J
A raid attempted by the Germans
against General Pershing's men north- j
west of Pont-A-Mousson came to
naught. 1
In the Macedonian theater the Bui-
garians are still in full flight before ,
the Serbians, who have captured nu-.
merous towns, taken large numbers of
prisoners and great quantities of war '
stores. Following the usual tactics j
of the Teutonic allies the enemy is ue- j
vastating the country he traverses,
leaving it a wilderness through the ;
use of the torch and explosives. ;
In European Russia the Bolsheviki !
and the Germans for the moment 1
fseem to have the upper hand over the!
Czecho-Slovaks, who have been com-
pelled to evacuate Volsk, Simbirsk '
and Kazan. The success of the enemy !
forces is attributed to a lack of am
munition and other supplies by the
Czecho-Slovaks'. In Trancaucasia the I
British force which recently went to i
the relief of the besieged Armenians i
in Baku have been compelled to with-!

MADE YESTERDAY TO REGAIN
LOST POSITIONS
i
LOSSES WERE HEAVY
ENTIRE BRITISH OPERATION HAS
GROWN INTO BRILLIANT SUC
CESS NOT FORECASTED BY THE
ORIGINAL LIMITED PLANS OF
THE ALLIES
WITH THE BRITISH ARMY IN
FRANCE, Sept. 19. 2 p. m. (By
The Associated 'Press.) Despite
t!-J serious menace which the Brit
ish established yesterday over the
Hindenburg line by their capture
of ridges northwest of St. Quen
tin, the Germans this morning
continued to nurse' grienvances
without renewing on a large scale
tieir costly counter attacks of last
evening.
Fighting still proceeded, partic
ularly on the extreme flanks of the
battle front where the British
were cleaning out strong points
'til "traifhtening their line, but
the initiative remained entirely
with them.
That the situation created by Bri
ish seizure- of the long Hindenburg
outpost lines and the dominating
heights in front of it could not remain
stationary for 'long seemed a foregone
conclusion. Whether the enemy would
essay further heavy counter attacks
depended entirely on the badly drain
ed resources at his command for the
next move undoubtedly belonged to
the Germans, since they must push
the British back or continue to live
with the naked sword hanging ovev
them in this vita! sector.
The enemy losses yesterday wewl
extremely heavy, both in the early
fighting and in the numerous counter
attacks which were thrown In toward
night in a desperate attempt to regain
part of the lost ground. The whole
zone of the long battle front today
was strewn with dead in the field
gray uniforms and more than 8jOuO
prisoners were in the British cages.
The entire British operation has
grown into a brilliant and important
success, which was not forecast in the
original limited plans. Not the least
important feature of the victory was
the slaughter Inflicted on the enemy
forces particularly during their fren
ried counter attacks, when they were
mowed down like wheat with the ma
chine guns, or swallowed up in a mael
strom of crashing shells from the Brit
ish barrage.
There were few spectacular inci
dents in yesterday's fighting, although
trc operations as a whole were spec
tacular -enough when one considers
that these gallant English aud Austra
lian veterans had In many places to
fight their way up three lines of
iiJgcs. with valleys intervening, work
ing forward doggedly over slimy
ground in the face of a vicious ma
chine gun and rifle fire from a myriad
of strongholds and from numerous
villages and hamlets which had to be
surrounded and crushed Into submis

cially bitter fighting about Holnon vil

ol this place thP day before, but the

was encountered. One of the
Americans addressing the sentry

the counter sign before the sentry
discovered the American's iden
tity. With the sentry prisoner the
patrol moved on until a second
sentry was met. This German
recognized the Americans and fled
fo his dugout. The Americans
battered down the door and cap
tured him and two of his com
rades, bringing them back to the
American lines wnere they were

YOU will need a Daylo for those vacation nights around

of the false sense of security when you think you know
the way.

After Beinj Relieved of
Rheumatism Gains
Fifteen Pounds
"When I first started on Tanlac I
was so crippled up with rheumatism
that I had to use two walking sticks
in order to get about at -all. But,
after taking four or five bottles, ev
ery pain was' gone, and I have actual
ly gained fifteen pounds besides."
The above statement was made by
William Choate, 34 West Riverside
avenue, Spokane. Wash., recently.
Rheumatism." he ontinued, "was
only one of many troubles Tanlac rt
lieved me of. I had suffered from a
bad stomach for twelve or fifteen
years. I couldn't eat scarcely any
thing but what gas would form and
almost cut off my breath, and bring
awful faint weak feelings over me.
There was a terrible hurting in the
pit of my stomach, and if I ventured
to eat anything except the lightest
food it would almost put me out of
commission.
"This was my condition a little over
a year ago when I made my mother
and brother over in Iowa a visit. Soon
after I got there my troubles got
worse. My kidneys started bothering
me. I had awful pains in the small
of my back, and constantly had head
ache. Then started in a siege of rheu
matism which I will never forget
was laid up for six months and was
flat on my back for several weeks
hardly able to move. It started in
my legs, then got in my arms, and
the pain was something awful, from
the tips of my fingers to my toes.
"When I did get up I was in such
a bad shape I had to use two canes
in order to get about at ail and this
is the fix I was in when I got Tanlac.
I read the statement of a man in the
paper one day, that fit my case ex
actly, and decided to see if It would
do me any good. Well, to make a
long story short. Tanlac simply did
wonders for me. Before I finished
my second bottle. I threw my canes
away, and could walk as good as any
one. And eat; why, I never had such

This will be the last pay day before the '
cash system goes into effect at the Phelps
Dodge stores for employes of the company.
And other mercantile firrns in the district are
also announcing the, cash plan. There
fore common sense and foresight dictate
that all should make ready for this cash plan
ere its coming. All the allied world, rich and
poor, high and low, are practicing econ
omy just now. That is, all patriots are do
ing so. The cash system in the district will
help all of us to do this. It demands that
we buy only what we need and have the
money to pay for. If it comes hard on the
first day, remember that it will be easier,
on the thirtieth day, when neither the mail
nor the knock on the door bring us bills;
larger bills it may well be, than our cash
outlay for that period.
General Von Morgen, commanding a
German army west of St. Quentin, did not
practice what he preached in the recent
British drive at this point. The brave and
bombastic German general addressed a
general order to his troops just before the
battle in which he declared: "Not one foot
of ground is to be given up ; I expect every
man from general to junior private to do
his duty in the imminent and decisive bat
tle ; you are more than a match for the
enemy." Well, a good many of Von Mor
gen's private soldiers did their duty, for
they died where they stood and the British,
of which they were supposed to be masters,
passed on over them, but the brave general
turned tail early in the fray and beat it
for his auto and drove to the rear at top
speed. So far as is known he may be going
yet.
Again has fate, through the medium of
the telegraph from Sioux City, Iowa, fast
ened an I. W. W. tag on the much tagged
coat lapels of Governor Hunt of Arizona.
This time it is in the form of a letter in
stead of a kodak picture. Harry Casey,
I. W. W. leader and active propagandist,
was arrested in the Iowa city by federal au
thorities on a charge of stirring up sedition
and promoting further wobbly activities.
In the eyes of the federal government the
wobbly is now an outlaw, neither more nor
Jess. Of course Casey, who was formerly
of Phoenix, had been arrested before.
These " fellows always have a jail record.
And pf course, he had a letter from Gov
ernor Hunt felicitating him upon his re
lease from prison. The more active and
dangerous and determined the wobbly the
more certain he is to have either a letter or
a photograph from or of Governor Hunt.
THE FEOPLE REMEMBER
(Prescott Journal-Miner.)
It is an old saying that "the people soon
fcreet," but the recent primary demonstrat
ed in at least one instance'that this is not
true. It was the case of.Justice of Supreme
Court Franklin who was seeking re-election
but who met decisive defeat at the hands
of his own party.
One does not have to look far to find
the reason for Franklin again being denied
his seat in the judicial tribunal. He was one
of the members of the court that unseated
Tom Campbell as governor and the Demo
crats whose expressed will at the polls was
set aside by a technicality had been waiting
long and patiently to get a crack at him.
Arizonans are getting strong for fair play
and they desire to see justice done rather
than a strict interpretation of the law which
means the deprivation of a victory honest
ly won. We do not believe there is a Dem
ocrat in the state who voted for Tom Camp
bell but what in his mind and heart is con
vinced that a majority of the people voted
for the man from Yavapai and that he was
rightfully entitled to the gulxrrnatorial seat.
One court presided over by a fair minded
jurist, a Democrat by the way, after a con
test dragging i: way into months held, and
test dragging its weary way into month.1
held, and rightly so, that Campbell having
received a plurality of the vote cast, was en
titled to the office and emoluments thereof.
But the supreme court, by a process of legal
reasoning which it is now patent, did not ap
peal to the laymen, found that Hunt was en
titled to the honor and saddled Campbell
with the costs of the contest a contest
which he did not inaugurate and in no man
ner was responsible for. And for the near
year he served, Campbell received not one
cent of salary or compensation, but it went
to his opponent and has remained in his
pocket ever since.
The protest against Hunt and Huntism
expressed at the polls was apparently ig
nored and the will of the voters vitiated by
the high court's decision. At least that is
the way it appeared. According to com
mon belief a (supreme court decision is
final, but this belief is erroneuos for the
court of last resort is the people of the ballot
box and even if they cannot nullify the de
cision they can and will overturn the man
responsible for it. It is in their power also ,
to make restitution through the same me
dium, which undoubtedly will be the re
sult next November when Tom Campbell
will again triumphantly be re-elected.
Franklin was known throughout the
state as "Hunt's Man" on the supreme
court. Whether the designation was cor
rect or not we cannot say. The fact that
every question with one exception affecting
the Hunt administration, which was carried
into court, was decided in accordance with
the administration contention, and the fur
ther significant fact that Hunt himself ped
dled Franklin's cards during the primary
fight and personally soliciting votes for him
on the ground "that he always stayed with
us" may account for Franklin being rightly
or wrongly branded as "Hunt's man." In
itself such a label would mean strength with
a certain element, and ordinarily would
with Hunt's stranglehold on the Democratic
party, resulted in a re-numerination. But
the spirit 'of fair play is paramount with the
people of Arizona to partisanship and feel
ing that Campbell was justly tntitled to the
position turned over to Hunt, they express
ed their resentment in no uncertain man
ner, thus sealing the political fate of the one
member of the supreme court at whom they
had a chance.
'NO SUCH WORD AS PEACE"
Here is what the Stars and Stripes, the of
ficial newspaper of the American Expe
ditionary Force, has to say about the "Ger
man peace offensive"wvhich has already
begun:
"Let the weak hearted who are dream
ing of a compromise; let the pacifists who
are talking of 'peace by agreement'; let
the side liners, who had enough of the war;
let the secretly inclined pro-Germans who
think this war should end without a deci
sion; let them one and all know once and
for all that, for the A. E. F. there is no such
word as 'peace with the Huns unbeaten.
The man who talks of peace today, except
through victory, is a traitor."
After a week's lull between Reims and
Arras it may be expected that the western
battle front will flame cut any day in a
fiercer flame than any of the war. The
mightiest blow of all is looked for from
Foch some time during the remaining five
weeks of fighting weather. We have yet
to win our, winter quarters in the Hinden
burg line.
Nashville Southern Lumberman: Now
that we are launched into the Siberian cam
paign, an attractive prize should be offered
to the1 genius who can devise some short,
snappy, pronounceable nickname for our
new allies, the Czecho-Slovaks.
Syracuse Herald: That European con
flagration has about reached the stage now
where the chief feels justified in telling the
reporters that the fire is under contral, al
though all the apparatus will be needed for
some time yet. '
Nashville Southern Lumberman: Owing
to the scarcity of cloth, it is announced,
women next year will wear their skirts
shorter. Mere man, for the same reason,
will continue to wear his last-year suit a
little longer.
Newark News: Los Angeles decided not
to post the Ten Commandments in public
buildings, as requested by the W. C. T. U.,
because of "Thou shalt not kill." which is
thought not to be in order just now.
Chicago Daily News: In these times a
fashion expert is any woman who ran get
two or more seasons' wear out of one
gown.

COCHISE MERCHANTS
HOLD SESSION
IN DOUGLAS
STEPS TAKEN TO FORM STATE
ORGANIZATION AND TO RESIST
COUNCIL'S ORDER MEETING
CALLED FOR SEPTEMBER 25
BISBEE REPRESENTED
DOUGLAS, Ariz.. Sept. 19.-Formation
of a state retail merchants' asso
ciation was decided upon this morn
ing at a meeting of the Cochise Coun
ty lerchants' association held in the
war building, 354 Tenth street, to
discuss the recent ruling of the Ari
zona state council of defense ordering
merchants to mark the buying as well
as selling price on all goods sold. The
organiaztion meeting will take place
in this city a week from today,
Thursday, September 25, at 3 o'clock,
in the afternoon. The merchants of
Bisbee, Tombstone,' Willcox, Tucson,
Phoenix, Globe, Miami, Prescott. .No
gales, Clifton, MoreneL Temple, Mesa
and other cities anu towns in the state
will be invited by telegraph to attend.
It is expected that many will be pres
ent, as the state council's ruling is of
vital importance to every man who
sells goods.
It was announced that the Tucson
merchants had already openly an
nounced that they would not obey the
order, and several of the local men
expressed a similar point of view. In
fact, it was said that stores might just
as well close up as try to obey. It
was stated that the enforcement of
such an order would put the small
merchants out of business and compel
the large and strong firms to operate
at a loss. The charge was made that
the order was the outcome of politics,
originating in Cochise county with the
object of striking at certain Cochise
county interests.
Not Antagonistic
At the same time it was made clear
that there is no intention of the mer
chants to antagonize the council. The
plan is to form a temporary state or
ganization at the meeting here next
Thursday and to complete it later at
Phoenix. The state council will not
meet again after the time announced
for Its order, which was termed a
"revolutionary decree," to go into ef
fect. Whether this will be October 1
or October IS those pre.-ent at the
meeting were not entirely sure.
However, just before the council
meets, representatives of the state or
ganization of merchants to be formed ,
here will gather in Phoenix, prepared
to present their side of the case in the
most forceful way to the council. It
was thought a personal visit of this
kind and talks from men of influence
would have more effect than sending
a host of letters ot protest from the
individual nieiriiauts.
Have Patriotic Motives
The protest will not be made as a
selfish measure. The merchants will
not make a play for sympathy or len
iency on the grounds that it will cut
down their profits and even put them
out of business. Some of the points to
be made are that in order to put the
proposed system into cn'.c' additional
help ,or manpower will required
an i it is not to be obtained. uch ad
ditional help would increase the cost
of merchandising. It will be shown
also that merchants wiio have been
planning to put their surplus in Lib
erty bunds will hate no profits to in
vest It will lie argued Hint the scheme
would thus work against the winning
of the war instead of for It. The prop,
osition was declared Impracticable. In
many instances merchants are requir
ed to mate a large dillerence between
the selling and Inning pi lie for ade
quate reasons which it would be im
possible to expl.iin lo the customer.
Sometimes, fin Instance, a merchant

began and then be obliged to sell it
below the prevailing market, price.
Jake Levy pointed out that in some in
stances the same goods have been
bought at three or four different
prices and that to sell them at three
or four different prices would be ridic
ulous. "Take away a man's chance to make
a profit from the sale of his goods
and of course he will give up the
business because there will be no in
centive to remain in it," declared Mr.
Levy.
Bisbee Well Represented
There was -k a laj-ge representation
from Uisbee, the meeting, as. a mat
ter of fact, having been, called on the
initiative of the Bisbee merchants.
Those from Bisbee were Robert Ham
ilton, John Angius, J. C. White. Ben
Franker.berg. The Douglas men were
Jake Levy, C. A. Overlock, H. C. Still-
man, C. H. Melcher. F. L. Sims, J. P.
Cull, H. K. Bailey, and P. W. Wilson.
T. J. Leeson, of McNeal, president ot
the organization, was in the chair.
Ben Frankenbers and Mr. White
told what the Warren District Busi
ness Men's association had done to
get action on the matter and what
Tucson had done. Mr. Stillman ex
plained that the local chamber of com
merce and business men's protective
association had gone on record strong
ly in the matter. Mr. Leeson made the
suggestion of a state organiaztion as
the best means of making the protest
of the merchants effective. He said
Cochise county was the first to form
an organization of retailers and that
it had been easy and effective. He
said that Cochise had been the banner
county cf the state in food conserva
tion and that Arizona had beep the
banner state.
Mr. Levy pointed out that the coun
cil's decree was unfair that it did not
order the merchants to put down tiie
cost of conducting his business, as
well as the cost and selling price. It
was further pointed out that the de
cree is a ruling of the state council,
not a law and provides no penaity, so
that it could be ignored only being
able in such an event to charge the
merchant with not being patriotic.

"Woman and the Law." staged by
R. A. Walsh, is unquestiouubly the
greatest woman's picture ever pro
duced. Baicd on the internationally
sensational De Saulles domestic trag
edy, which shocked not only the
United States, but South America, as
well, it follows the story from its
inception in far off Chile to its dram
atic climax in the prosaic little Long
Island court house. It depicts in a
terribly realistic manner the heart
rending experiences of the little South
American woman, who married the
big Yale quarterback. The De Saulles
case, as you know, was no ordinary
domestic tragedy. De Sallies, him
self, man about town, was not only
known in the world of sport, but in
diplomatic, political, in the White
Light district and social circles. He
had been United tSates minister to
Uruguay, South America, and had
been prominently mentioned in con
nection with the ambassadorship ot
Mexico and Chile. He was instrumen
tal in organizing lui'.lWu college men

One of the strongest, most gripping
dramas in which Bessie Barrise-ale.
the Paralta star, has yet appeared is
"Within the Gup," which will be the
attraction at the Lagle theater today
only. In it Miss Barriscale. as "Thisb
Lorraine," suffers the uncanny warn
ing, delivered by "Tea Cup" Ann. a
Bohemian fortune-teller, that her soul
is cursed and that, though she will for
ever try to realize the love for which
her heart craves, true love will never
be attained. The horrible prophesy
and the ghost of her past haunt her
throughout the play, one of the most
impressive which i'aralla has yet produced.

Nothing was known of the shooting

that Ghent had been shot. He refused
to say whether the shooting was due
to an accident or was intentional. The
wounded man was taken to the county
hospital at once, and while his injur

will recover. He was shot in the right

LONDON, Sept. 19. (By The Asso
ciated Press.) The Belgian foreign
minister in discussing Germany's
"peace approach" to Belgium, declares
that the conditions cannot be taken
as a basis for any serious discussion.
From the details furnished by the for
eign minister it appears that Belgium
received no formal proposition direct
ly from the German government, but
the communications came by an indi
rect .U-nr.el.
These showed that it was Germany's
intentioj to demand that t'elgium bind
herself to effect a solutian or ta lan
guage question in conformity with the
Geruim imperial policy, wnich Belgi
um would regard as an abdiration oi
the rifcht inheritant i.i her sovereignty
to solve internal problems in accord
ance with the freely expressed will of
tne Belgian people.
Germany would also claim full am
nesty for Belgian citizens guilty oi
helping me enemy plans, and would
thereby, according to the minister, im
pose on the Belgiau government an
act of submission.
Germany would insist on the main
tenance alter the war of the commer
cial treaties previously in force. This,
-iLliowing up the destruction of Bel
gian industry by the advance, says
lue minister, would Insure Germany's
eccnomic grip on the country. More-
oeiyhe adds, the pawn theory is not
ataudoned. Germany would insist upoji
binding the fate of Belgium with the
solttion of the colonial question.
Finally, the obligation resting on
Germany to repair the damage unjust
ly inflicted on its victim was not even
alluded to. Germany, the minister
points out. would thus be enriched by
the pillage of Belgium, whose ruin
would be complete.
These indirect approaches made no
reference to the eventual suspension
or hostilities between Belgium and
Germany, nor to the evacuation of
Belgian territory.
The foreign minister concludes:
'The conditions thus set forth over
shadow and render sterile all declara
tions which appear to recognize the
.independence of . Belgium. They can
not be taken as a basis for any seri
ous discussion. The Belgian govern
ment formulated its program in its
note to the pope on Dec. 14 last and
published in January, and, as all tlie
allied governments know, is firmly re
solved to maintain it undiminished."
ROME IS INTERESTED.
ROVE, Wednesday, Sept. 18. Presi
dent Wilson's reply to the Austrian
peace note was read with much inter
est by Pope Benedict and Cardinal
Gasparrl, the papal secretary of state,
and other officials of the Vatican, who
had been watching the developments
closely. It is said the president's re
ply caused surprise by reason of its
brevity, although it was regarded as
perhaps the only answer that was pos
sible at the present time.
There is every indication that .the
Vatican will not make any effort to
press Austria's proposal upon entente
allied governments notwithstanding
the request made in the note.

WITH THE FRENCH ARMY IN

It is supposed therefore that the leaf

through them amidst a hail of bul

lence. The eastern part of Fresnoy still
was in the hands of the enemy this
morning, with the British holding the
western section and pressing the de
ft nders hard.
To the north in the center of the1
battle line the Australians pushed
through to their final objectives, and
even beyond in some places, with their
accustomed thoroughness and disre
gard for their personal fate. The over
seas men worked round those villages
which were strongly held and employ
ed a heavy smoke barrage with great
Biiccess.
Prisoners declare that because of
this smoke screen they never Jtnevv1

strike next, and as a result there was
more or less confusTon among the
Germans opposite them.
Leverguier and Villeret were taken
without much trouble. About Hargi
court and Tenipleux Le Guerard, how
ever, there was hard fighting. There
were numerous quarries in this sec
tion and these were filled wi Ger
man machine gunners who had to be
disposed of before the advance could
proceed. The delay was not great.
The rangy Australians were about
and amongst the enemy like a whirl
wind, and he was a lucky Hun who
lived to take the long trail back to
the prison camp.
The Australians had to negotiate
three ridees here, and on the last of
these, which overlooked the Hinden
burg line, the Germans made a deter
mined "last ditch" stand.
Savage work characterized the
fighting here, but the Germans were
no match for the hard hitting east)
erners and were forced to fall back
little hv little until they reached the
outpost system to the Hfndenburs
line. This defense was heav.ly wired
and strongly held. Back of it on thi
eastern side of the canal lay the main
Hindenbure line of fortifications
Against this outpost line the Austra

Not only was the outpost line taken

Lempiere was captured after
a hard battle. The enemy soutn ot
Vil.'erysGuislain contested the Brit
ish advance fiercely and the losses to
th d fending forces here were tre
mendous.
A further British advance was 83
sisted by a novel innovation in the
way of madUne gun Barrages. Two
hundred and fifty rapid firers weie
brought up and concentrated. Thes
tuns opened a terrific barrage, dur
ing which each one of them pumped
5.000 rounds of ammunition into the
r.ermm defenses. The enemy was
absolutely overwhelmed. In one small
place, for example, 300 dead later were
found.
In Gauche wood the Germans had
four British tanks, which they had pre
viously captured. These tanks were
used as machine gun fortresses anu
he'd out for hours before taken.
Later in the afternoon the Germans
opened a heavy attack between Havrl
court and Villers-Guislain with the
sixth German division. The attack
succeeded in rolling the British back
somewhat on the left, but this ground
was quickly regained.

BY REVIEW
NEW YORK. Sept 19. Absence of
special Influences made trading in the
stock market today of perfunctory
cnaricter. The narrow movement of
tht. r-K'i'fc popular shares af an iudi
cation of the general dullness, and
the day's aggregate volume was equiv
aifciu to less than an hour's overturn
in a fairly active market,
The general market today suggest
ed confidence in a gradual vKaring up
of the influences which hare held
bullish iuJfafive In restraint.
Decrcastd activity In tho steels was
attributed to a disposition to await
th-3 cutcme ot the Wethington con
ference, at which an appeal was pre
sented for price increases. Especial-
strength was manifested ui shippings.

oil groups.- after an ctrly period ot

levels. Sales amounted to 160JUOO
shares.
Aionesary conditions were Unaltered.
Weakness developed again in ex
change rates on some ot the neutral
countries.
Liberty Bonds showed a yielding
tendency in spots and other issues
also inclined lower. Foreign loans
were well sustained, with French gov

GRAIN MARKET.
CHICAGO, Sept. 19. Frost predic
lions today made the corn market av

$1.49k to $1.49U
Oat3 finished Vfc to c to 'c up.
and provisions varying from 42c de
cline to a rise of 55c.
Likelihood that frost would extend
over a wider area than heretofore. t-
1'ecially in Iowa, Missouri and Kansas,
gave the bulis in corn decidedly the
advantage until the last hour. Then
Ceiman talk of an armistice before
winter led to something of a reaction
Belief that corn in cars on track here
would be declared available for deliv
ery on September contracts tended
x so to ease the market after midday.
Nervousness regarding possible seri
ous damage by frost remained in evl
ience, however, as the Iowa state re
port said 40 per cent of the crop was
ret yet out of danger. Besides, teni
;rraturca continued unseasonably low
all the way from the Rockies to the
Alloghenies. " .
Oats were strengthened by signs of

LAST PAYDAY BEFORE
GASH SYSTEM GOES
INTO EFFECT HERE
SEVERAL LOCAL STORES WILL
INAUGURATE SELLING FOR
CASH ONLY ON FIRST OF COM
ING MONTH AND EVERYONE
HAD BEST BE PREPARED
This will be the last payday during
the wartime history in Bisbee when
the general public may walk into a
number of local stores and say "charge
it to me." You may say it. but it
will be the last chance you will have
of being obeyed.
Sometime ago the Phelps-Dodge
Mercantile company announced that
the system of collection of bills
through the office of the Phelps-Dodge
corporation. Copper Queen division,
would be abandoned with the 1st of
October. This means that in almost
every instance cash on the nail will
be demanded. Extraordinary circum
stances might alter the rule in some
individual cases, but according to pres
ent Intentions such cases almost
would be non-existent.
Following the lead of the P.-D. com
paBy, several other local stores have
decided to install the cash system ex
clusively. Prominent among these will
be the J- B. Anguis grocery.
Many other stores are undecided
as to what course they will folow but
have determined that even If they de
cide to carry their old customers, they
will open no new accounts.
In all the stores In Bisbee cash trad
ing will be encouraged in every way
possible. The payment of cash will
aliov.' :he giving of special bargains,
hitherto impossible u'nder the credit
system, it Is claimed. In one or two
instances Jt has been reported, busi
According to the plan, as carried
out this year, the three junior high
schools of Bisbee (which have a
twelve-nicnth school year) and are
open to the Educational students fori
practice teaching. Each practice teach
er assumes full cliarge of the classes
tc be taught, the work being so dis
tributed that two or three practice
teachers carry on the work of one reg
ular teacher. The wcrk is closely sup
ervised, with regular conferences be
tween teacher and supervisor. Hur
supervisors from the university shared
In the supervision. Mrs. A. E. IXiug-
las, for the modern languages; Mrs.
H. H. Foster, for the English and
history; Miss De Rosette Thomas, for
the home economics, and Dr. H. H
Foster, fcr tbe. science and mathemat
ics. Twenty-three young women from
the university took advantage of the
opportunity to tear "in this way. the
wclrk toeinr: distributed f among . the
three Junior schools at Bisbee, Lowell
and Warren.
But practice teaching was only a
part of the summer work. During the
evening three courses of college in
struction were offered in methods of
teaching. In high schools, in education
al standards and measurements, and
in methods of teaching .home econom
ics. Each student in the summer ses
sion doing full work carried two
courses of instructicn, the practice
teaching being counted as one for
those engaged in. it.
In view of the limited variety of
courses offered, the limitation of work
to college seniors and graduates, and
the fact that no effort was made to
bring in students frcm outside the
university, the registration of thirty
two students for this initial session is
decidedly gratifying. A considerable
number of teachers from Cochise coun
ty were enrolled for the courses other
than practice teaching.
The social life of the session was
not neglected. Week-end picnics and
parties were the rule, though the. su
premacy of the week s work was kept
inviolate.
Wliether the summer session will be
continued and expanded has not yet
been finally determined. The suc
cess of the present summer seems to
justify doing so.
