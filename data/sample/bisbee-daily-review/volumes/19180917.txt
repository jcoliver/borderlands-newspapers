UNDATED WAR LEAD BY THE
ASSOCIATKD TRESS The United
States has turned its back on the
Austro-Hungarian peace proposal.
Secretary Lansing by authorization ol
President Wilson announced that the
United States "can and will entertain
no proposal for a conierence upon a
matter concerning which it has made
Its position and purpose so plain."
The Pritish secretary of foreign af
fairs. 'V?. Balfour, has also slated,
though unofficially, that he was ut
terly unable to see that such a- con
ference as proposed by Austria could
have the desired end, adding-, . -
"It is incredible that anything can
t come of this proposal."
While the German newspapers com
ment on the proposal as if German
had no part !n it, the Vienna news
papers declared emphatically that all
of Austria's allies Lad been informed
of Austria's intention, though the ac
tion was Austria-Hungary's own.
Meanwhile in the various theaters
of the war the fighting is going cn
steadily and with added impetus in
Macedonia, where the reconstituted
Serbian army, co-operating with the
French forces, have stormed three
strongly fortified positions and occu
pied Vetrinik. Dobropolje and Sokal
considered the most important part of
the Macedonian front.
Further east on the Doiran-Vardai
front the first and second line Bul
garian positions have been captured
lv the allies over a ten-mile section.
This successful operation, according to
Mr. Balfour, who announced it at a
reception of the Greek delegation in
London, is "the prelude to an im
portant offensive bringing greater tri
umphs, in which the British and Greek
troops would take an equal and glori
ous part.
French troops, in their advance to
ward the Cheniin Des Dames have
gained two thirds of a mile on a two
and a half mile front northeast and
east of Sancy, where they captured
an additional six hundred prisoners.
American and German patrols are
doing the major part of the work on
the Lorraine front, but there are re
ports of a possible great attack by
one side or the other In the Vosges.
In that mountainous territory the ar
tillery fire has developed great in
tensity and hostile airplanes have
been unusually active.
All reports indicate a marked in
crease in the work of the airplanes
along all the fronts. The Germans,
who quite recently appeared to lack
adequate air forces, have sent aug
mented forces Into the air and there
have been numerous engagements. As
an illustration of the severity of the
fighting the British airmen on Sunday
accounted for 37 German planes, while
they themselves reported sixteen miss
ing. While the Czecho-Slozaks have been

NEW YORK, Sept. 16. There
are 184 cases of Spanish influenza
in this city, according to Health
Commissioner, Ccpelaud, who said
there was no cause for alarm over
the presence of the disease. Thir
teen suffers were reported today
aboard an incoming vessel, and
were removed to a hospital. The
department's chief difficulty, said
the commissioner is the handling

Enemy Shows Signs of Prepar

.AMERICAN HEADQUARTERS IN
LORRAINE, Sept. 16, (Reuters.) It
probably is not an under-estirrate to
assume that the Americans in obliter
ating the St. Mihiel salient reduced
the enemy's strengthby the equivalent
of four divisions. The victory of the
Americans was due to German inferi
ority in numbers and a greater Inferi
ority in morale.
The enemy was so busily occupied
in getting out of the salient that he
did not have time to remove his dead.
The statement coming from the Ger
man high command that It Is glad, to
be rid of the salient may be believed,
but it may be doubted if the command
also is glad to haev lost 15,000 men,
more than 100 guns, an innumerable
quantity of machine guns, trench mor
tars, tens of ammunition and tele
graph material as well as railroad
equipment, rolling stock, clothing and
supplies which either were burned or
captured by the Americans.
False conclusions must not be
drawn from' the results of the opera
tion. To put it briefly the eGnnans
did not fight and the trifling damage
they did to the French and Americans
proves it.
The Germans may have done the
wisest thing, since, if they had tried to
stand, their losses would have been
increased enormously.
The allies had the means to insure
such a result and the fact that the
operation required only 67 per cent
of the time allotted to it is proof that
a much more strenuous resistance
was expected from th'e enemy. He
was in such a hurry to remove bis
guns that scores of them were cap
tured without having fired a round at
the attackers.
The Germans already have begun to
react. The number of enemy airplanes
has increased greatly and the allies
are striving to give them off. At night
the Germans attempt to bomb the
Americans. These things do not sug
gest a beaten foe and it would be the
gravest mistake to imagine that the
Germans are done with.

ANOTHER BLOW
NOW EXPECTED
Looked for Hourly as Answer
of Allies as Whole to Peace
Proposals of Kaiser Bill &
Company
WASHINGTON. Sept. 16. Another
blow against the German lines as an
answer to the peace proposal of ths
Central powers is expected moment
arily by military officials here.
The point of the expected attack is
a rntter of widespread speculation by
officers. Several simultaneous at
tacks will be delivered, it is thought,
with the Flanders front the French
operations about La Fere directed at
laon and the new American front
across the mouth of the old St. Mihiel
salient as the logical positions from
which Marshal Foch would strike.
It has been noted that British artil
lery has been poinding the German
lines west of Cambrai with especlul
vigor recently which may be the pre
lude to a direct drive for the capture
of that city.
Since the French are slowly making
their way to a flanking position which
would force the Germans to withdraw
from the Chemin Des Dames lines
protecting Laon, some officers believe
a new movemenf along the Aisne and
probably extending to the east of
Rhelms is to be anticipated.
It is pointed out that should the
Germans be forced to withdraw from
the Chemin Des Dames, a swift ad
vance from the Rhelms front would
tend to outflank the whore enemy line
from there to Verdun.
There is no" Information of an offi
cial character as to General Pershing's
present operations. The greatest reti
cence apparently is being inforced on
press correspondents in discussing the
tactical disposition of the American
army at this time and to observers
here this suggests that preparations
for a new advance are under way. The
logical objective. It is held, would be
the occupation of the Brely iron field
and an effort to encircle Metz from
the west. If General Pershing is mov
ing toward that goal now. It Is said, a
Joint attack by his army and the
French army holding the Verdun front
would be a probable development.

in t-fc case of two of the number. ThP
chif-f importance of the third group is
that its appearance inspired the ef

DISCUSSIONS AT PRESENT
WILSON'S TERMS FINAL
SWEDISH AMBASSADOR TOOK
HOURS TO DECODE AUSTRIAN
PROPOSAL BUT RECEIVED HIS
REPLY AND LEFT STATE BUILD
ING WITHIN TWO MINUTES
WASHINGTON, Sept 16. The
United States, as was fully expected,
has unconditionally rejected Ger
many's peace feeler. In doing so the
government has spoken for all the co
belligerents. Almost immediately after receiving
the Austrian government's note from
the minister from Sweden, Mr. Ekerv
gren. Secretary Lansing tonight is
sued this formal statement:
Mr. Lansing made this statement:
"I am authorized by the presi
dent to state that the following -will
be the reply to thit govern
ment to the Austro-Hungarian
note proposing an unofficial con
ference of belligerents:
"The government of the United
States feels that there is only one
reply which it can make to the
suggestion of the imperial Auttro
Hungarijn government. It has re
peatedly and with entire candor
stated , the terms upon which the
United States would consider
peace and can and will enter no
proposal for a conference upon a
matter concerning which it has
made its position-and purpose So
plain."
Mr. I.ansing'i statement was given
cut within naif an hour after he baJ
received the Austrian proposal. It
vculd have been forthcoming al.ftost
ini.nc -diately upon the delivery of the
Austrian note had it not been found
necessary i:i order to a.oij the possi
bility of grave error to make a care
ful comparison between the official
text and that which was received In
tiws dispatches last night from Am
sterdam. Thus, emphasis was added to the
cYr:l:iiition if any were needed,
the quickness of the reply indicating
the existence of no shadow of doubt
in the mind of the administration as to
what it should be. As soon as Mr. Lan-siiu.-'s
reply ran be put In form it will
be handed to the Swedish minister for
transmission to Austria.
The Swedish legation notified the
state department early in the after
noon that it had received the note and
that it would be presented as soon as
it could l e decoded and translated
from the French. This consumed -err
I hours and it was not until t:2 l
o'clock that Mr. L'kengren appeared.
H i.Mm;iiif(l with the secretary oniy

There is some reason to believe
that the secretary acted ith this un
precedented promptness la a matter
of such great import with the design
l ot only to indicate clearly the posi.
tion of the I'nitcd States government,
but perhaps to anticinate anJ prove-.'. ,
as far as possible newspaper discus
sion of the Austrian proposition which
might convey to the enemy a mislead
irc imriMsion tl.i't there was any con
sidtrable element in the I'nlted SMt.i
willing to consider a negotiated peace
such as the "non-binding"- discussion
proposed bv Austria might develop.
Also, it is understood there was a

gram, "that as long as they are
out on strike I will not confer
with them nor take any steps in
their behalf and that they will Be

reply to one from Mr. Matthews,
who said many of the mines were
closed, the men quitting work de
spite the fact that he had tried
to induce them to remain on the
job pending settlement. TWO

OUTLINE WAR WORK
PHOENIX. Ariz.. Sept. 15. Many
Arizona people are expected to attend
a state conference here Tuesday when
the united war work campaign of the
seven war work associations will be
outlined to the general public. The
public meeting will be held at the
Young Men's Christian association
building and the delegates and visitors
are to be addressed by several promi
nent people, among them Dr. Kather
lne Bement Davis, who was formerly
at head of commission of corrections
and charities in New Yoik City. She
will tell about the work In the crowd
ed cities and industrial centers that
is being done by the associations. An
other speaker will be O. Logan Burns

In Europe at the request of the French
government. Senator Benson of Cali
fornia is on the program, also G. S.

paign in the southern department, is
expected to arrive here Monday for
the conference. He is nation-wide

northeast of Oelles-Sur-Aisne. The
nummber of prisoners counted since
yesterday morning is 3500.
"'Aviation: Fair weather enabled
our aviators to do a great amount of
work on our own front as well as in
connection with the American army.
There were many severe combats.
Fourteen enemy airplanes were
brough down or put out of action and
seven captive balloons set on fire."
POLES ARE ENTHUSED
HARBIN, Saturday, Sept. 7 (By the
Associated Press). A movement ex
ceeding, perhaps, that of the Czecho
slovaks is being organized by Polish
officers to form a Polish division to
fight in Siberia westward to their op
pressed fatherland as integral units
In the American army. According to
conservative estimates, an army of
more than 100,000 trained militarists
Is Immediately available in the region
of Harbin, Klkolsk and Vladivostok.
Large corps of railway men also
can be utilized if necessary to take
over the Chinese Eastern railroad.
The funds to be used in creating the
Polish army are to be considered a
loan to the Polish people or their
government.
The Poles have asked that they be
promptly granted recognition by the
United States government so that they
may aid In opposing the spread of
German aggression as well as win
their own freedom.
Entente allied officials here see
three benefits to be derived from the
encouragement of the Poles. First,
they say it would obviate the necessity
of moving additional troops across
the Pacific; second, the allied forces
now In Siberia could be moved west
ward to strengthen the Murman coast
expedition ultimately bringing pres
sure to bear on the western front;
and third, an army composed of Cze-cho-Slovaks,
Poles and Ukrainians
would galvanize the Russians into action.

After a spirited controversy, a mo
tion to strike out th revisions ex
tending income? taxation to salaries of
the president, federal Judges, and
state, county and municipal office
holders, was defeated. Another con
troversy developed over the provision
to tax interest from issues of state,
county and municipal bonds, but a
final vote was postponed until tomor
row because of lack of a quorum. An
amendment proposed by Representa
tive Hardy of Texas, democrat, to
change the basis of calculating profits
from sales of property held by the
owners since 1912, also was rejected
overwhelmingly after Majority Leader
Kitchin had declared the principle ad
vanced would cause a revenue loss of
$2,000,000,000.
Besides voting on the question of
taxing income from state, county and
municipal bonds, the house tomorrow
will consider administrative provi
sions of the individual income tax sec
tions, the corporation income tax pro

Summary approval today of the nor

spread of Bolshevik ideas, which
might in some way be behind this
movement to bring about a peace and ,
terminate the war before it had been i
fought to a clear derision. There is
no such apprehension on the part of ,
the administration of a cataclysm
which will bring down all civilized in- j
itltutlons, and instead the general
staff has given every assurance that '
the war Is proceeding to a reasonably,
early and complete victory, which will'
involve the acceptance by the Cen-!
tral powers of the only possible
terms of peace namely, those laid
down by President Wilson. !
These terms referred to in the reply ;
dictated today to the Austrian note,
were clearly set out in President Wil-
son's Fourth of July speech at Mount
Vernon, as follows.
"1 The destruction of every arbi
trary power anywhere that can sep
arately, secretly and of its single :
choice disturb the peace of the world;
or, if it cannot be presently destroyed, 1
at least its reduction to virtual impo-!
tence. ;
"2 The settlement of every ques-
tlon, whether of territorial, of the sov-!
erelgn. of the economical arrangement
of political relationship, upon the basis i
of the free acceptance of that settlement-by
the people Immediately con
cerned and not upon the basis of the
material interest or advantage of anv
other nation or people which may de
sire a different settlement for the
sake of Its own exterior Influence or
mastery.
"3 The consent of all nations to be ,
governed In their conduct toward each '
other by the same principle of honor ;
and respect for the common law oft
civilized society that govern the indi-'
vldual citizens of all modern states in 1
their relations with one another; to ;
the end that all promises and cove- i
nants may be sacredly observed, no '
private plots or conspiracy hatched, no
selfish injuries wrought with inipu-1
nity and a mutual trust established
upon the handsome foundation of a t
mutu&l respect for right.
"4 The establishment of an organ-1
izatlon of peace which shall make it ;
certain that the combined power of ,
free nations will check every inva-1
slon of right and serve to make peace
and justice the more secure by afford
ing a definite tribunal. of opinion, to;
which all must submit and by which :
every international readjustment that
cannot be amicably agreed upon by
the peoples directly concerned shall
be sanctioned."
There is some speculation in official
circles as to what will be the next
step in what is recognized as the
great German peace offensive. Gener
ally, it is believed that the German j
and Austrian military leaders . will ;
point to the American reply as an evt-
dence- that they have done everything
possible to bring about peace, and i
thus try to strengthen their people for j
another winter campaign. But another!
view is that owing to the intolerable j
conditions in AuBtra-Hungary there is
more than a possibility of a breaking '
up of the quadruple alliance; that
Austria, having gone through the form
of making jk peace proposal, which
was proptly rejected, has thus cleared
the way for her next Btep-an uncon
ditional surrender on the terms laid
down by President Wilson.

Lay On, Macduff
Yes, Austria would like to have peace ; a
German peace, else she would not cry so
loud and so dolorously at this time. Aus
trian rulers, only a few weeks ago, met
with the kaiser and his staff and pledged
their loyalty anew and since then have sent
Austrian troops to the western front. Aus
tria has simply agreed to be the German
catspaw and rake the chestnuts from the
flame of war. If she were sincere in really
wanting peace for peace's sake, she would
break with the butcher nation that, leads
her now in chains and undertake to "treat
with the allies as an ally against Prussian
ism. They are all talking peace these days.
The crown prince, the Prussian ministers,
the Austrian ministers and the kaiser him
self. It is the Prussian's last cardn If he
can bamboozle the allied world with his
hypocritical whine and appeals, then he
can negotiate peace. And any kind of a
negotiated peace, no matter what the Ger
man concessions, will be a triumph for
Germany and a defeat for the allies. The
battlefield, and not the council chamber, is
the place to settle this quarrel between the
two forces of the world.
Any allied leader or private in the ranks
or citizen who listens for a moment to this
currish howl for peace by the German beast
through his slave of Austria is a traitor to
his country and to the allied cause.
It is an insult and an, arrogant, overbear--ing,
ill-veiled, sneering, cynical confident
characteristic purely Prussian to suggest
peace while still on French and German
soil. It is the demand of the victor rather
than the honest voice of repentance.
No stronger proof could be needed by the
allied world as to the measure of German
distress and apprehension under Foch's
hammer strokes than this starting of the
winter" peace propaganda by the Prussian
so far ahead of his schedule. He is at least
three months early.
Any consideration of peace by the allies
short of a badly beaten German army and
an invaded Germany will be the sin of all
the ages.
And so long as Lloyd-George and Clem
enceau and President Wilson are in power
there is not much to fear that the beast's
whine will be heeded in the three great na
tions dedicated to the task of freeing the
world from a military domination.
"Lay on, Macduff,
And damned be he who first cries
Hold, enough!"
THE CANDIDACY OF COLTER
(From El Paso Herald.)
Although many Arizona precincts re
main to be heard from, it is now appar
ent that Fred T. Colter will be the demo
cratic candidate for governor in opposition
to Thomas E. Campbell, the republican can
didate. Sufficient returns have been re
ceived to make certain the defeat of Sec
retary of State Sidney P. Osborn and Judge
Fred Sutter in Tuesday's primary. They
stood as the candidates of conservative
democrats in Arizona. Colter, supported
by Governor Hunt and his radical -following,
stands as the candidate of the demo
cratic party.
Mr. Colter has an interesting personality
and a good legislative record. He has made
good in the state senate, supporting such
popular measures as woman suffrage and
prohibition, and has been very successful
in his own a fairs. He is a banker, mer
chant, cattleman and farmer and nothing is
more strange than that a man of wealth, en
gaged in these occupations, should receive
the support of the I. W. V. faction and of
that body of democrats who are not an
archists or I. V. W, but who border on be
ing socialists.' But he has all that vote. His
support does not all come from those
sources. Many high class, loyal, sober and
conservative democrats must have voted
for him in the piimary or he never would
have defeated Messrs. Osborn and Sutter
so completely. But the fact that he has
never publicly condemned the traitorous
I. W. V. who are trying to control the
state and the fact that he has their support
puts a big, black mark against him. And
his attacks on the large industries of the
state, made in his campaign literature, are
so much like Governor Hunt's as to indi
cate that he and Hunt are completely in
sympathy and that his administration, if
elected, will be just like that of Hunt.
In other words, it appears that Colter,
like Hunt, would look with suspicion and
unfriendliness on any enterprise employing
a large amount of capital and a large num
ber of men and that if such an enterprise
were so unfortunate as to be attacked by
" the I. W. W., it could expect no favor from
him. Though doubtless meaning well.
Governor Hunt has never been big enough
to treat all classes of citizens as equal.
Whether Mr. Colter, if elected, could give
a square deal all around cannot be taken for
granted in view of the influence around
him and of his pronouncement up to the
present time. If Mr. Osborn or Judge Sut
ter had been nominated, Arizona would
have been certain, in the event of their elec
tion, of an administration friendly to or
ganized labor, friendly also to the farmer
and to business and industries but very un-,
friendly to the pro-German, the anarchist,
the Bolsheviki, the I. W. W. and the long
whiskered individual who makes a living by
moving from place to place stirring up class '
hatred and agitating strikes.
As it now stands, Arizona has the choice
of two men for governor. One has the
backing of a very undesirable element in
addition to the support given him by good
citizens. He bears the radical brand. The
other is a progressive and broad minded
conservative who treats everyone alike and
who gave Arizona, in the eleven months of
his gubernatorial administration, the best
state government it had had in years. The
first is Mr. Colter, the second, Mr. Camp
bell. The first is a democrat and the second a
republican, but parties dont matter now.
Democrat and republican are but names.
The men count and what they stand for. If
Arizona people want a sane and sound ad
ministration, free of class animosities and
freak notions, they will elect Mr. Campbell.
If they choose to uphold the treacherous,
unpatriotic I. W. W., who are again trying
to get control of the state, after having been
scared half to death during the adminis
tration of Governor Campbell, they will
vote for the candidate whom the I. W. W.
support.
In the last previous state election, Mr.
Campbell received the vote of a very im
portant part of the democratic party, in
cluding not a few organized labor men and
he will receive more votes from organized
labor this time, now that the eyes of man'
have been opened to the Belshevik tenden
cies of some of their'leaders. He will also
receive the support of conservative demo
crats who are in rebellion against Huntism.
When Mr. Campbell received the gov
ernorship, it was pulled away from him by
court mandate after he had served faith
fully and efficiently for eleven months, and
Governor Hunt pocketed the salary which
Governor Campbell had earned. This tin's
Mr. Campbell will be elected for keeps.
Every strong man and brawny workman
in the Warren district will appreciate this
one about Pat Ryan, workman from Ken
tucky, and now in France. Collier's Week
ly tells the story of how Pat was reported
dead and how his friends in a certain town
of the Blue Grass state mourned his un
timely fate. But Pat was not to be killed
so easily. Standing six feet .four in his
socks, and built on what the reinforced con
crete people call monolithic lines, he sat
down and wrote to his ;old boss "that he
was not killed in action this spring at all,
at all. Pat used to run big engines over
the road for the Illinois Central and says he
is now working as a traveling crane in the
back shop of a French locomotive works.
He picks up those little French choo-choos
one under each arm and places 'em where
desired!'
If the Germans have any stronger posi
tions than the Queant switch line and the
St. Mihiel fortifications anywhere between
the present battle line and Berlin they are
not known to the allied military men. We
have broken the best they could set up in
the way, and we will break the others that
still intervene between our armies and final
and absolute victory by force of arms.
After reading section 5 of article iv of
the Arizona state constitution, we -take it
all back. We are now ready to admit that
the Arizona constitution is a "God-given
instrument."
HOUSEWIVES MUST
SAVE ALL SUGAR
THEY-POSSIBLY CAN
JUST WHEN FLOUR SITUATION
CLEARS UP SOMEWHAT, COMES
CALL FROM STATE FOOD AD
MINISTRATION ABOUT SHORT
AGE OF SUGAR
There is no chance for the house
wives to relax in regard to food con
servation. Just as the wheat situation begins
to look brighter, she has now to turn
her attention to a more intensive
sugar saving program. Last year's
temporary shortage served to point
the way. Means were discovered of
cutting down on sugar and using oth
er sweetening. That was a mere ap
prenticeship, however, compared with
the conservation campaign which now
becomes necessary.
For the burden of maintaining the
allied sugar supplies falls on us. There
is not enough sugar available for us
all to live in accordance with our
peace time habits. We must share
with them. Our great war program
has reduced our sugar carrying fleet:
the sugar requirements of our over
sees army are very large; our domes
tic crop is less than we expected; we
have diverted 50.000 tons of sugar
shipping in order that Belgium should
have iood; Germans have destroyed
sugar beet fields and factories in
northern France and Italy; more than
50.000 pounds of mgar were sent to
the bottom of the ocean off our shores
recently.
If. by our own selfish use of sigar.
we should force the allies to send to
Java for 250.000 tons to piece out
their meager ration for next year, it
would take eleven extra ships. These
eleven ships couid transport and keep
150,000 to 200,000 soldiers in France.
This loss in shipping space can be
averted by reducing cur own normal
consumption.
To reduce this by almost one-half,
as is new being asked of us, seems a
sudden sacrific. but it can be done
and without any loss of nutrition.
Since about 70 per cent of the coun
try's sugar supply passes through the
hands of the American housewife, it
is evident that she has a most impor
tant role to play in its conservation.
t Irst, it Is her part to see that no
more than two pounds per person per
month come into the family larder.
Second, she must make this amount
go around. It must be pooled and
made to cover table use as well as
what goes into the cooked food.
All this tkes time and thought, but
it is a voluntary contribution to ulti
mate victory. Judging from the part
she lias played in the nation's w heat
savin,?, the American housewife will
again be sure of recognition when all
returns are in on the sugar savins
campaign.

BROADWAY FOLLIES
OPEN THEIR RETURN
ENGAGEMENT HERE
The Broadway ' Follies opened an
other four-day engagement at the Or
pheum last night with the clever mus
ical comedy, "In Hawaii." A full house
greeted the players for both shows of
their first night.
A profusion of new costumes and
clfor ts marked their return and some
pretty displays of feminine loveliness
wire thrown into the picture.
The beautiful Bromley sisters, of
course, came in for their part of the
applause. Miss Lucille Harrow, the
prima donna, rendered several selec
tions which were well received. The
".1lody" boys Hre the only male
members of the cast, and they ably
support the other members. Miss
Marie Mcfourt, "the gingor girl." is
a first-class comedienne and her ap
pearance is always the signal for ap
plause. Altogether the show is clean, spar
kling and something new. They play
"In Hawaii" agiin tonight," and then
the next two nights they will present
"Manana Land," which, if past per
(rmaucett are any criterion of their
ability, will be of an order seldom
seen ill Bisliec.
Last Tuesday a military policeman
drove up to the international boundary
at the custom house in his motorcycle
said a few words to a bonier patrol
man, and was informed that a soldier
had deserted a few hours before and
was roaming around Agua Prieta.
The provost guard, quick as a flash,
tossed his automatic to a soldier who
was standing nearby and beiore he
could be stopped started his cycle and
dashed into Mexico. He was halted
by Mexican customs men. American
customs inspectors took up the matter
of getting the motorcycle back, and
within a few minutes after the Mex
icans took possession of it the car was
safely on the American side in the
hands of soldiers. The provost guard
who had all by himself invaded Mex
ico was detained by the Agua Prieta
authorities until Wednesday morning,
when he was brought back to the
American line and set free. -
Gustave G. Lelevier of this city, a
native of France, and an ardent war
fan, considers the wiping out of the
Saint Mihile salient by Pershing's
men as one of the most important
achievements ot the war. It places
the allied army within a few miles
of Metz, one of the greatest fortresses
in Germany, where the Germans, he
believes, have 100.000 men. This
strdhghold was taken from the French
by the Germans in 1S70, as Mr. Lele
vier remembers it, 130,000 French sur
rendering at the time. The French
commander was banished for his ac
tion. The Germans did not assault the
fortress but surrounded it and starved
out the French. In the peace treaty
Bismarck insisted on keeping the
Metz fortress, saying it was worth
twenty divisions of soldiers. In mod
ern warfare, however, it may not be
so impregnable. Most likely the Amer
icans will surround it as the Germans
did in the Franco-Prussian war.

NEW YORK, Sept. 16. In a dull;

market today the restricted money sit-j
uation overshadowed the political slg-
uiiicance of the Austrian and German
peace overtures. The bank statement
of Saturday, disclosing a decrease In
reserves, together with the calling of
loans by banks today, were the general
controlling factors In the absence of
any inclination in official quarters in
Washington and London to respond
to the Teutonic proposals.
After a steady opening, interpretive
of a continued check of the recent
liquidation and of satisfactory war
news, sharp recessions developed in a
few of the speculative issues, notably
American Sumatra Tobacco, whicn
suffered a decline of 7 points during
the day to 107V. its lowest in many
months.
Thereafter speculation of a highly
irregular character materialized. The

the injury could not have been even a
remote cause of her death.
Another witness on this point was
the nurse, Mrs. Caroline Munbach,
who said that Mrs. Madden's recovery
from the injury had been slow but
steady and that on the afternoon pre
vious to her seizure she believed that
she had almost entirely recovered.
Witnesses of the accident were Of
ficer Culp. It. L. Larsen.,V. C. Condron
and B. E. Williams. They said that it
was caused by Rice making a wider
turn than he should have made and
the officer said that he was traveling
about eighteen miles an hour when he
struck the standard. He would regard
that as reckless driving, considering
the location. In relation to the charge
that Kice had been drinking, the of
ficer saiil that when he came up he
smelled liquor but that Rice was quite
sober.
The witnesses as to the cause of
Mrs. Madden's death were not cross
examined and at the close Judge Lew
is moved to dismiss. County Attorney
Lanev said he would offer no recom
mendation and would leave it to the
court. He did not believe, , though.
that while Kice might be held he j
could be conivcted on manslaughter
on any evidence the state could pro-'
duce. 1
The charge of reckless driving was j
taken under advisement. j
