Whole System of Military Law
Practice and Legal Proced-,
ure May Undergo Change
All Records of Previous Cases
Placed Before Committee
to Make Advisory Study
(By Review Leased Wire)
WASHINGTON, March 26 Plans
of the war department for alteration
In courts martial procedure were the
subject of the first conference held
by Secretary Baker upon his return
today to Washington from an inspec
tion trip. The secretary met with N.
Gregory of Chicago, and Judge Andrew
J. Bruce of the University of Minne
sota, members of the American Bar
association committee appointed to
make an advisory study of the whole
question of military legal practice
and procedure.
Mr. Baker after the conference said
he had placed, all the personnel and
records of the Judge advocate gen
erals office at the disposal of the com
mittee. He said that in addition to
the formulation of recommendations
they had been asked to call attention
to any individual cases of injustice
that might strike them in reviewing
. court martial proceedings.
Probe Being Conducted
The secretary had no comment to
make as to what he planned with re
gard to publication of the reply sub
mitted for his consideration by Lieu
tenant Colonel Ansell of the judge ad
vocate general's department, to state
ments by Major General Crowder,
judge advocate general, previously giv
en out through department channels.
One element of the controversy tna
has arisen over the military legal sys
tem is the investigation being con
ducted at the secretary's order by
Major General Chamberlain, inspector
general. Mr. Baker said he had not
seen General Chamberlain and did not
know whether that investigation had
been completed. From other sources
it was learned that the inspector gen
eral probably would not finish his
work for some weeks.
Ansell Attacks Chamberlain
The only copy of Colonel Ansell's re
ply known to have reached any one
outside the war department was that
furnished by Acting Secretary Cro
well to Senator Chamberlain, chair
man of the military committee ofthe
last senate.
When Senator Chamberlain made
public the text of his telegram to Sec
retary Baker demanding that the An
sell reply be given out for publication
there was circulated among newspa
per representatives at Washington a
statement saying among other things
that Ansell had attacked General
Chamberlain and other high army of
ficers as "reactionaries" in the testi
mony he submitted to the senate com
mittee. The statement led to the be
lief among officers at the war depart
ment that Colonel Ansell's reply to
General Crowder raises objection to
the assignment of General Chamber
lain as investigator of the contro
versy.

TO
"I Hope to See Better Times,"
Says Wilhelm; Signs "Deep
ly Afflicted Father
COPENHAGEN. March 26 (By the
Associated Press.) The Deutsche
Zeitung of Berlin has published a num
ber of letters illustrating the attitude
of the German emperor and the crown
prince during the fateful days of last
November, says a dispatch from the
German capital.
The emperor wrote to Frederick
William on November 9 the following:
"My Dear Boy After the court
chamberlain informed me that it was
impossible longer to guarantee my
safety at main headquarters and that
the troops were no longer trustwor
thy, I resolved, after a severe mental
struggle to leave the army, which had
collapsed and o to Holland. I ad
vise you to stick to your post until
the conclusion of an armistice.
"In Berlin two governments under
the leadership of Liebnicht are fight
ing against each other. I hope to see
you again in happier times.
"Your faithful, deeply alflicted fa
ther. WILHELM."
The crown prince, on .November 11,
wrote to Premier Ebert, asking per
mission to remain at his post so that
he might bring back his army in a
well disciplined and orderly manner.
In his letter the crown prince pro
ceeded to justify his attitude against
those representing him as a war in
stigator and reactionary. He de
clared that he had always taken the
standpoint that the war for Germany
was a war of defense.
"I had long pleaded with General
Ludendorff," he asserted, "for a wise
peace by understanding under the fa
vorable opportunity when we occupied
strong positions during and before the
spring offensive. Nevertheless, when
the great eyent hurled my father
from his throne, not only was I not
heard, but was simply passed over as
the crown prince and heir to the
throne." ;

It is constructed to carry a large sup

Non-Inflammable Gas
Ship May Enter Race
LONDON, March 26. (By the As
sociated Press.) An airship with en
gines and cabins inclosed in an outer
envelope so that the craft can float
on the sea may be a competitor for
the Atlantic flight. The admiralty
was en?af,ed in building two such
air vessels before the war ended and
it was expected they would be supe
rior to Zeppelins for scouting for
fleets.
The feature of this craft, which was
one of the several surprises being
prepared for the Germans, is the use
of a non-inflammable g.-.s. The late
Prof. Ramsay was the discoverer of
the gas. which permits of the con
struction of engines, so that they can
be placed on an airship, which can
float on the water if disabled. Shots
through the envelope, it is said, will
only damage the gas compartment

The airship is not expected to be
ready for trial before June 1.

Changes Suggested to Make

Protect U. S. Theory
(By Review Lease Wire)
NEW YORK. iarch 2$. Seven
amendments to the Leapje of Nations'
covenant, intended primarily by their
author to insure the American conti
nent against European aggression, to
protect the United States from en
forced administration of foreijn terri
tory and ot revoke the 'trouble

litical independence of Member na

Charles E. Hughes.
Among 'the suggestions of the for

were that d if in it e limitation be placed

and other similar problems and that
provision be made for the withdrawal
of states from the organizations.
in an address beto ue Union

the terms of the proposed covenant,
Mr. Hughes declared tnae ie Ameri

The "Hughes amendments" sug

First Explicit provision as to the
requirement of unanimity of decision.
second Suitable limitation as to
the field of the league's inquiries and

Mr. Hughes criticized severely the
tenth article of the covenant and con
ceding the argument that this clause
had been included to protect the na
tions born of the war, the speaker re
garded it
not a '.'peace maker.
it makes no allowance, he said, for
changes in the makeup of member
nations which may be found advisable
and "a bribes a sounduess of judgment
t othe peace conference in erecting
states and defining boundaries which
neboJy' in the history of the world
ha serer possessed."
Mr. Hughes declared that he saw
neither "severity nor hardship" in the
articles relating to investigations and
recommendations by the league for
reduction of armaments. He regard
ed the provisions for arbitration ai
confined generally "to existing prac
tice" and "falling far short of amy
positive assurance against war."
Emphasizing that submission of in
ternational deputes to the league au
thority is optional also as is the de
cision of member natoins to go to war
to enforce an award of the arbitra
tion authorities made after such a
submission, he found merit, howeter,
in the "cooling off" process set np In
the allowance of three months for con
sideration of the arbitrators' decision
before disputant smay go to war.
Doctrine Protection.
The provision for reports my mem
ber nations of impending international
disputes, the former supreme court
jurist asserted, "gives ua the lesson of
the war. It commits to no action,
leaves the door open for the only co
operation that can properly be cou-ten
templated, tnat is, tne co-operation
which at the time o fthe exigency is
deemed to be advisable."

GOVERNOR HARDING
ON STAND IN PROBE
OF PARDON BRIBES
Affidavit Charging He Re
ceived $5000, Ignored
in Testimony
(Ey Review Leased Wire)
DES MOINES. March 26. Governor
W. L. Harding appeared a3 a witness
late today in the Iowa house judiciary
committee's investigation of the Rath
bun pardon case, and began an ex
planation of his reasons for granting
the pardon.
It was brought out that the gov
ernor's Information' In the case, be
fore granting the pardon, was con
fined to an examination of an abseract
fined to an examination of an abstract
from George Clark, the Rathbun at
torney, with recommendations of
clemency from the trial judge and Ida
county attorney.
No reference was made by either
the governor or members of the com
mittee to an affidavit by William Rath
bun, father of the pardoned youth.
in which the senior Rahtbun asserted
it was his ' understanding the $ 5,000
he gave Clark for obtaining the par
don was to go to the governor,
dark Repeats Statements.
The governor was on the stand only
a short time before recess was taken
until 8 p. m. He was preceded by
Clark, who reiterated statements he
previously made to the committee, and"
Charles Witt, the governor's secre
tary. One phase of the governor's testi
mony contradicted that of Clark, In
that the chief executive declared it
was late In September when Clarjj
approached him regarding the pardon,
while the Ratbun attorney had assert
ed It wa s"about November 4" when
he first took up the matter with the!
governor.
The governor testified he now be
lieves there Is no question as to the
guilt of Ernest Rathbun, who is in
Anamosa reformatory, lollowing rev
elation of his pardon at the instance
of Attorney General Havner.
Thought Boy Innocent.
When he said his opinion was based
on the records in the case, Special
Counsel Byers asked: "And you could
have obtained the same opinion if you
had, with slight diligence, investigat
ed the case before granting the par
donr "Well, not with slight diligence,"
the governoi4 replied, "but I could
have found it out all right."
"If at the time you granted the par
don you knew what you now know,
woufd you have granted the pardon?"
Byers queried.
"No, I wouldn't," was the executive's
reply.
"Then, why didnt'you call in the
parole bord and let the pardon be is
used in the customary way" he was
asked. .
"Iy mind was made up," he gov
ernor answered. "After reading the
abstract given me by Clark and the
recommendations for clemency signed
by the presiding judge and the county
attorney, I thought the boy inno
cent.' Clark told the committee that the
only person he showed we pardon to
other than the Rathbuns was to the
father of Ray O'Meara, who was joint
ly indicted with Ernest Rathbun for
criminal assault. The attorney said
he had offered to endeavor to obtain
a similar pardon for O'Meara for
16.000.
Mr. Witt, the governor's secretary,
said he had received from Clark cer
tain papers in the case and had turned
them over to the governor. He did )
not know the pardon had been grant
ed, he said, until he read of it in the
newspapers.
. Harding Only Witness.
Governor Harding was the only wit
ness examined at the night session,
which lastednearly three hours. In
cluded in his testimony was a refer
ence to his meeting in Chicago with
two or three Ida Grove men. two days
before the pardon was granted.
For twenty minutes, the governor
said, he talked with Ed Mentz and
Noah Williams of Ida Grove and a
W. C. Ernst of California, but. the con
versation was not in reference to the
Rahtbun case. .
In resuming his inquiry concerning
information in the fcvrernor'g posses
sion when he signed the pardon. Coun
sel ByerB asked : '.
"You relied absolutely for your in
formation in the case upon a man with
whom you had only a sitght acquain
tance?" referring to Attorney Clark.
"YeB," the governor replied.
Counsel Byers then read parts of
the evidence presented to the grand
jury that indicted Rathbun and from
the testimony introduced at his trial
and the governor agreed that it con
tained far more incriminating evi
dence than was shown m the docu
ments sent to him.
The governor will continue his tes
timony tomorrow.
Hands Express Thouohts: TO FIGHT FOR
REGENTS BOARD SEAT
Gestures Are Exnlained State Superintendent, H
Gracefulness and Cleanliness
Essential to Real
Beauty
By Edith Hyde
"The Girl of the Golden Apple."
A woman's hands are to her
thoughts what her face is to her
emotions. Hands many times
convey more meaning than
words. The ability to use the
hand gracefully and effectively is
purely a matter of tsaining and
cultivation, possible for every
wpman whether the form of the
hand itself is beautiful or urgly.
The first and most important
thing about beautiful hands is, of
course immaculate cleanliness.
Cheap alkili soaps will ruin the
most beautiful hands. With a
good soap and soft warm water,
the hands should be lathered
thoroughly, the nails brushed,
and if necessary to remove stains
or grime that the soap will not
remove readily, a little lemon
juice should be used. Then a
few drops of perfumed glycerine
should be poured into the palms
while they are still moist. A
dash of talcum powder when tne
glycerine is half rubbed in has a
very softening effect. This treat
ment should keep the average
hands in perfect condition.
Gracefulness of gesture must
bee ultivated. It is the result of
absolute control of movement.
No grace is possible in the hands
from which the nervous tensiou
cannot be withdrawn at will.
Even an angular hand loses stiff
ness when relaxed in repose.
Cultivate the ability to devitalize
the hands and allow them to re
pose. Gestures should always
proceed from the body outward.
Movements which display effort '
are devoid - of dignity or grace.
Don't take things from people,
learn to receive them graceruliy.
Some women have perpeutal
motion of the hnds. In the pri
vacy of your room break yourself
of- such bad habits as rubbing
your cheeks and eyes, fussing
with the hair or dress, slipping
your rings off' and on and play
ing with ornaments. If you are
nervous and must fuss with some
thing, carry a fan. The real
cause of these ungraceful move
ments is self-consciousness. Try
this: Drop th'e arms before you
and wring your hands violently
for a tew minutes until they are
numb and lose consciousness.
The brief forgetfulness induced
by the lack bt consciousness in
the hands helps to banish awk
wardness. After a month's daily
practice you may have broken
yourself of the abnormal con
sciousness that makes graceful
hands impossible.

Service for Subscribers
Commencing April 1, THE REVIEW. will inaugurate a new system
of delivery based on the ownership by the boys of the routes. On the same
date THE REVIEW will put into force a new subscription rate, made
necessary in part by the change in delivery system. Better service will
result fcr all subscribers with the Inauguration of the two systems.'
The following subscription rates will be enforced after April 1:
One Week $ .20
Six Months 4.00
One Year 7.50
The only substantial change from the old subscription rate is in the
weekly charge, which is raised slightly. . The old three-months rate has
been entirely discontinued. Ail rates are to be strictly in advance.
Under the new system the boys will have businesses of their own.
The community is divided into practically equal routes. Each boy owns
one. He pays THE REVIEW in advance for his papers, and collects from
his subscribers. What remains above his debt to THE REVIEW is his
profit. 'lr!
Under the old system the remuneration to carriers was so small'
that it was difficult to secure and keep boys who take an interest in their
routes. By inaugurating the new plan, the boys are given businesses earn,
ing as much as 6 per cent interest on $4,000. The attention they pay to
these businesses will determine how much more they will earn. And the
actual value of the route to the boy when he wishes to leave his business,
is comething from which he can realize ready cash. Under the same sys
tem a newsboy in San Francisco sold his route in the business district to
his successor for $2,000. .

The Y. M. C. A.
The present is no time to consider what the Y. M. C. A. and Y. W. C.
A. may or may not have done in the district to please you. The all
important question now is what they will accomplish here in the near
future. And it depends upon which attitude you may assume, whether
they will accomplish anything.
The plans of the two organizations are concrete and definite. Both
have built up wonderfully in the past. They have grown from meagre
little institutions of a few members to powerful Influences In the dis
trict. The once small and inadequate quarters of each association has
been enlarged, added to and re-equipped until each is up-to-date and
modern in every department.
So much for their past.
In the future they plan even greater strides. The Y. M. A. and
Y. W. C. A. have learned the lesson of the missionary; that they must
reach out to the community, not try to draw the community under
their two roofs.
They are beginning now to practice what they have learned. The
extended hand of fellowship goes out from each building. It grasps hold
of men and women who in no other manner could be reached. It gives
them tactful, watchful, careful assistance. They become better, broader,
bigger American citizens.
So much for the future.
The present demands of the Y. M. C. A. and Y. W. C. A. on the
district are small in measure of the importance of each institution. Never
before has the Y. W. C. A. come before the public to subscribe a
budget fund. The Y. M. C. A. has made its appear only when necessity
demanded, and many years have elapsed without a public tpdget
campaign.
This year conditions demand the funds. More" trained help is vital
ly needed by each association. They have many unskilled, willing local
workers, but they must have additional men and women trained for
special work. Expenses of the past year have been heavy drains on each
association's finances. To maintain the present standard of efficiency
they must have funds. To carry on the present activities and develop
ments they must have help. Without it, future expansion will be impos
sible. One of the richest mines in Arizona lies beneath the water level
of the old Tombstone properties. The mine wa3 opened with a boom.
It started one of the greatest towm. in Arizona's history. For a time
it developed. Then underground waters encroached. The largest pumps
obtainable could not lower the subtereanean floodl Today the mine is
idle. It stood still for a time, then died.
One of the richest fields for. development in the country lies just
ahead of the Y. M. C. A. and Y. W. C. A. They have started out
auspiciously, grown rapidly and prepared the way for greater conquest. .
They have reached their water levels. If their pumps fail, if they
cannot control their floods, they will stand still for a time, then, like
Tombstone, crumble.
So much for the present! How much? All you can spare!
"Super-Production"
There is much talk of "super-production" in Europe. They know
"over there" that while the great war debts are being paid even larger
sums must be spent for social legislation. They know that while labor
is being better fed, housed and cared for in every way the nation must
still compete in the markets of the world. The two things seem con
tradictory impossible. War taught how to do the impossible as a part
of regular routine.
"Super-production" means a new and higher stage of industry corre
lating novel industrial forces on a colossal scale.
France and Italy will chain the rushing Alpine streams to the wheels
of industry. Wonderful plans to multiply the effectiveness of England's
coal are taking practical form.
The skilled mind of the scientist and the trained technique and
creative resources of the laboratory will take the place of chaotic
chance inventions as the foundation of industrial progress. New ferti
lizers drawn from coking ovens, the air, the depths of the earth and the
weeds of the sea will force soil fertility.
The intensive teachings of battle are bein gapplied to transporta
tion on land, water and in the air.
International bankers plan vast credit arrangements to link the
smallest producing units with the ends of the earth to insure everywhere
the greatest effectiveness of capital.
New systems of technical training, linking shops, farms, banks and
schools and reaching all ages and classes will multiply skill in industry.
But the main dependence of "super-production" will not rest upon
mechanical changes, standardization, trade improvements, 'financial
schemes, technical training nor scientific research. "Even greater gains
are expected from the removal of the friction that now absorbs more
than one-half the energy of the industrial machine the friction between
tyrannical, autocratic, exploiting, lncomi3tent management jand urn
skilled, underpaid, rebellious, poverty-stricken workers.
Laborers harassed with a death and sickness rate three times that
of more prosperous classes will not be "super-producers." Employers
with a "labor turnover" of three and four hundred per cent are noi
competent to direct "super-production."
; So the world is puzzling with problems of joint management,
housing, social insurance and the perfection of the human relations in the
process of production.
The riddle turns back to it3 beginning and points to its own solution.
Only by the creation of a higher civilization for all can the burdens of war
be bourne. The first elements of "super-production" are higher wages
and democratic management of industry. "
We Don't Agree With You. Mile. Gall
"Opera bingers and other musical artists should not marry," said Mile.
Yvonne Gall, prima donna of the Chicago Opera association.
"For no woman, no matter what her personality may be, can do
justice to both spheres," she continued. "Act, especially musical art, is
a very jealous mistress that will brook no rivals. Tut if a woman is over
come by the great emotion called love, she must simply decide and
decide well for which of the two her love Is greater, then choose that
and renounce the other."
So far. so well; but let us now cail the witness for the other side.
?.!me. Louise Homer, famous prima donna, married, a mother, and
happy, says:
"I feel that my children are essential to my art. There is every
reason why a successful mother should make a successful artist and
vice versa."
I.Ime. Schumann-Heink is a mother of eight children, and a grand
mother, albeit she has gained no end of fame and wealth in the musical
art.
Enrico Caruso has not permitted his musical art to interfere with
his matrimonial career, and since his marriage to a New York girl has
doubled his income.
Raoul Riendeau, Cleveland tenor, father of three children, insists
that' it was his wife who gave him the greatest aid and .encouragement
while climbing the ladder toward musical success.
John McC'ormack. another tenor, loves Ireland, music and his career,
but more does he love his two children. Says so himself.
Alma Cluck has done famously well with her musical career, despite
the "handicap" of a husband and two children.
(Business of jury going out to ballot on the question, returning with
verdict.)
"We, Uie jury of puV.ic opinion, find that matrimony does not inter
fere with one's musical career."

RAIL IMPROVEMENTS ;
TO CONTINUE DESPITE !
SHORTAGE OF FUNDS
Director General Hines Says
Construction and Repair
Work to Go On
(By Review leaned Wire!
PITTSBURGH, March 26. Despite
the financial predicament of the rail
roads, the railroad administration
plans to carry out as much of its im
provement program as possible to
keep .labor employed and the roads
in 'repair, Walker D. Hines, director
general of railroads, declared in an
address tonight before the Pittsburgh
Traffic ciub. He asked for a. more
adequate understanding on the part
of the people of the problems facing
the railroads during the war and in
the immediate future, and presented
suggestions for placing railroads held
privately under ' public supervision
permanently as a solution. He em
phasized that the ability of the rail
road administration to finance itself
in spite of the failure cf its appro
priation does not mean that it will
not need the approbation as soon as
congress meets again.
Referring to the improvement pro
gram. Mr. Hines said:
To Continue Work.
"Unfortunately the impression has
gone out that the railroad administra
tion has decided to cut off all im
provement work, including additions
and betterments and maintenance.
This is not a fact. What has hap
pened is that we are taking steps
to give the railroad corporations full
opportunity to determine whether
they should assent to the work which
they must finance. It is the intention
of the railroad administration to carry
forward just as much additions and
betterments and maintenance work as
possible in order that labor may not
be thrown out of employment unnec
essarily and in order that tha railroads-
be kept in good repair and ex
tended to meet the needs of the sit
uation."
Proposing eventual private opera
tion with government supervision, Mr.
Hines said:
"My own view is tnat a moderate
guarantee on capital should be pre
scribed (by the government) so as
to give a reasonable assurance to cap
ital, and that theer should be a right
to participation in any profits mado
in excess of that guaranty so as to
furnish the needed stimulus to pri
vate initiative.
Government Directors.
"I further beliove that the govern
ment should be strongly represented
on the boards of directors and thesa
government directors should consti
tute an important part of the regulat
ing body which prescribes the rates,
so that this regulating, body will know
as necessities develop that the neces
sities are developing and will be able
to meet the needs of the situation
much more nearly at the time the
needs arise than is possible at pres
ent. "I do not believe these fundamental
changes can be successfully carried
through except by the construction of
a comparatively few great railroads,
each of which will so combine the
prosperous and unprosperous roads
a3 to present a fair average result
and get away from the hopeless di
versity in earnings which has existed
in the past; and upon which it will

A. Pollard Rolls Into Second
Place in National Meet
With 714 Total .
(By Review Leased Wre)
TOLEDO, March 26. For the
second time within two days the
former world's record for inaivic
ual score was broken today in the
American Bowling congress tour
nament when A. Pollard of Indi
anapolis rolled into second place
with a three game total of 714,
four points below the mark set
by Harry Cavan of Pittsburg on
March 17.
Pollard, who bowled last nigUI
with the Marmon No. S4, collect
ed 223 rins in his first game, 245
in his second and 24G in his final.
Pollard s nine games in the tour
nament gave him a total of 1SSX
for seventh place in the all. events.
Two other changes resulted in
the individual standings on the
late squads this afternoon when
Jimmie Smith of Milwaukee and
New York took fifth with 670 and
F. Fox of Indianapolis bowled 663
for seventh place.
The highest two-men score dur
ing the day of competition was the
1299 bowled by W. Smart and F.
Boyle of Cleveland. J. Genal and
F. Joergers of the Athearn hotel
team 'Hint went into first place
last night in the five-men event,
bowled 1211 on the last squad this
afternoon. Owen Bush, a Detroit
ball player, and J. Goodwin of In
dianapolis, were paired today and
scored a team total of 1725.
Bowling on the first squad of
five-men teams tonight the Recre
ation Meteors of Detroit relied the
highest score with 2,837. Fage
Dairies of ToieJo were second

MILITAMTS DENOUNCED
BY SUFFRAGISTS IN
ANNUAL CONVENTION
National Association to Be
Divided Into Voters
and Non-Voters
(By Review Leased Wire)
ST. LOUIS, March 26. Following
the organization of a non-partisan,
non-militant and non-sectarian wom
an's voters' league, the afternoon ses
sion of the National American Woman
Suifiage association adjourned late to
day without deciding on a name for
the league. The motion cf adjourn
ment came following two hours of
heated debate as to the name best
suited for the .newly-formed organiza
tion. It had been agreed that the name
should not be applied until after the
convention in February, 1020, in order
that the present name of the associa
tion be in efi'ect as the convention j
to fee centennial celebration of Susan
B. Anthony's birthday.
The object of the new organization,
which is in the form of two houses,
bne composed of delegates from vot
ing states and the other from 'non
voting states, is to secure protection
in thoir right to vote to the women
cnizens oi the United States by ap
propriate national and state legislation
and to ii crease the effectiveness of
women's votes in effecting better gov
ernment. Deloga:c3 from the non-vctir.g states
now compose the house of delegates
and those frcm suffrage states the
house of Vv.it rs.
At the afternoon session ?S9.0cO was
raised from the various states com
pleting a budget cf 120100 to carry
on the work during next year.
In eulogizing pioneer workers at a
session today Mrs. Rachel Foster
Avery was attired in the black silk
gown ard shawl Miss Susan B. Anth
ony wore ia many.cf her addresses o
woman suffrage in years past.
Mrs. Mary II. Loines of New Yorn
city is the only delegate attending the
convention who was present at the
first convention of the American Suf
frage association in 1S69.
At the morning session the progress
of the federal amendment in congress
was reviewed and assurances that ulti
mate victory would be" attained in the
G6th congress were declared by fieia
gates. Militant suffragists were arraigned
bitterly for their public demonstra
tions and denounced as obstructionists
to the success cf the amendment.
Sectional executive conferences
composed the night session. Speakers
included Mrs. Frank 1. Schuler, Miss
Mary Garrett Hay and Miss Rose
Young, all of New York city.

cago club of the National league, and
formerly manager of the Baltimore
Federals, and L. Edwin Goldman,
former director of the complainant
club. The former said he had signed
numerous players and that the club
!was compelled to offer unusually
large salaries. This was due, he said,
to realization by the players that they
were going to a new organization and
fear that if (anything happened to
the new venture they might find it
extremely difficult to return to the
ranks of organized baseball.
Both witnesses were asked many
questions regarding tne reserve clause
in the contracts of professional base
ball plyaers, Goldman asserting that
it was through these clauses .the or
ganization maintained control of play
ers from one season to another.
In response to questions regarding
the relative value of baseball players,
Goldman gave it as his opinion that
actually there were not enough real
first class ball players in the country
to form one team. He explained the
system through whica players are
purchased and drafted and agreed,
on cross-examination, that the Federal
league, in paying big salaries to Na
tional and American league stars who
jumped to the Federals dii uot have
to take into consideration the original
draft price of the individuals.
George Wharton Pepper, counsel for
organized baseball in the case, asked
the witness whether he considered
that part of the salary paid profes
sional ball players was given them in
consideration of the reservation the

parts. .

CORDOVA, Alaska, March 26.
Alaska's canneries in 1918 packed
more salmon than has ever been

By "Biz" B. Phan
Mark 'nother day off the cal

The date of the Cubs-Warren dis

what Christmas is to the small

Christmas comes every year,
whereas we fans seldom get a
chance to see a big league club

more twirlera against us, an I'll
tell the world fair he can afford to,
with that gang of heavers that

See where Jim Vaughn, that
"ace" of pitchers, is sick. Word
from Pasdena, where the Cubs' is
limberin' up, imparts the inside
info that the big southpaw is ini
provin' and leelin' so peppery that
they had to nail him down to keep
him from puttin' on his ol uniform
and gettin out to warm up yes
terday. An', in the course o' teliin us
that "fast an' reppery work mark
ed the practice of the Chicago Na

I'ress man slips us the secret that
Alexander will join the club long
'bout April 4 just in time for him
to work out once or twice before
the Cubs play here, an' he may" be
given a crack at tossin up a few
for the local talent to look over.
Guess most o' the local bugs
would like to see Alex work
against the home team, but quite
a few would just as soon see iJm
Vaughn on the slab. Any bird
who has a record like his is worth
seein", Alezander or no Alexander.
Not quite -so steady as the big

U.S. NAVY SOON WILL
HAVE 300 DESTROYERS
WASHINGTON. March 26. With
approximately 300 destroyers to be
in commission by the end o fthe year,
the navy department is working out
plans for the peace time handling of
this force. The first suggestion made
was to place 200 of the ships in re
serve, but it was learned today that
a movement was taking shape toward
keeping the entira force n active
commission, even if it would be neces
sary to put a larger number of older
battleships and cruisers in reserve to
obtain the necessary personnel.
Some of the old torpedo boats and
destroyers undoubtedly wili be sold
in "the near future. These include, it
is understood, the vessels that were
employed in home waters during the
war. They were not then regarded
as fit for, more than limited service
and with the large number of new
destroyers to take their places, it is
believed they will soon be stricken
from naval lists entirely.
Eighteen members of the British
house of commons lost their, lives in
the recent war.
The War and Your Gasoline
fc e
The first of a scries of three statements
For obvious reasons the following facts of interest to
the public could not be published during the war.
They affected a vital war necessity regarding which
the Government required secrecy. But now that the
war is won, we are at liberty to make the following
statement of facts:
$4,302.95 SUBSCRIBED
IN Y.M.C.A. CAMPAIGN
With a total of $4,302.95 collected in
three days by the twelve teams in the
Joint Y. M. and Y. W. C. A.'s drive for
funds officers of the campaign are
well satisfied with the results. There
are three more days left in which the
residents of the "Warren district may
subscribe to the fund, which is to be
used by the associations for this
year's support.
It is the plan of the campaign man
agers to raise $11,600, and as more
than half this amount must be can
vassed in the remaining three days,
the public is urged to give their rea
sonable support to these Institutions
which are doing so much good in this
community.
Although there are twelve teams
working all day long it' is practically
imposslble for the workers to canvass
each individual home.
To facilitate the work of the drive,
those desiring to donate may send in
their check to the . Y. M. C. A. or tele
phone a worker to call at your home.
Any amount, no matter how small,
will be gratefully accepted by the
chairman of the campaign, who will
duly acknowledge the subscription.
Highly volatile gasoline for fighting
aeroplanes was one of the war needs.'
The output of this special gasoline by.
all the refineries east of the Rocky
Mountains was not enough, so Califor
nia was called upon, to furnish a large
part of the supply. At the request of
the United States Government the Pa
cific Coast Petroleum War Service
Committee apportioned California's
quota among such of the large refiners
as were able to make this special gaso
line. The Standard Oil Company, being
the largest of these, had the greatest
quota to fiH We were glad to do our
part. We supplied more than our quo
,ta of aviation gasoline.
Aeroplane engines, operating high in
the air under conditions of extreme
cold and rarefied atmosphere, require a
different gasoline from engines operat
ing on the ground. In fact, the needs
are so special that the gasoline manu
factured for aeroplane use (often used
at altitudes of from 20,000 to 25,000
feet) would be utterly indifferent for
use in automobile or other internal
ccmbustion engines operated on land
or sea.
Aviation gasoline has to be highly
volatile. It must vaporize rapidly even
in the extreme cold of very high alti

tudes. On its rapid vaporization alone
must often depend the lives of the men
in the aeroplane. This gasoline would
not be good for general use. If would
lack power on the ground, its loss in
storage by evaporation would be great
and it would be expensive.
Making aviation gasoline for the
Government took a very considerable
part of the low boiling point or highly
volatile constituents of the crude oil,
and, as a result, the gasoline left avail
able for regular use lacked those quali
ties which assure easy starting of the
automobile engine.
The Government's demand for avi
ation gasoline reached its maximum in
the late fall of 1918, and then for a peri
od of about six weeks the deficiency of
Red Crown gasoline in low boiling
point constituents or easy - starting
qualities was most apparent.
Now that the war is won and the
great demand for aviation gasoline has
ceased, we are again able to offer the
same grade of Red Crown gasoline as
formerly, with the same full and con
tinuous chain of boiling points from
the low to the high which is necessary
for easy starting, quick and smooth
acceleration, high power and long
mileage.

INSURANCE RATES OF DOINGS OF THE DUFFS
t
MILLION MEMBERS OF
LODGE TO BE RAISED
Tom will do his rwimming on, the second floor.
Fifty per Cent Caused by In
roads Made by Influ- j
enza Epidemic j
(By Rfvifw InseJ Wirrt !
CHICAGO. March rti More than a
'million members of the Modern!
Woodmen of America, the largest fra-i
ternal insurance organization in the i
country, had their rates increased to-'
day to meet the abnormal death losses
resulting from the influenza epidemic, j
which caused a reJuctiop in the bene-;
ficiary fund of the order from $12,000.-,'
000 to $700,000.
On tte present membership the in
crease is a flat advance of 50 per
cent and all new members joining
hereafter will have to pay materially
increased rates.
Even this increase is said to be
not a strictly .actual, adequate rate,
but it was as far as Ce membership
could be induced to go Et this time.
The action was taken today at a
special meeting of the head camp of
the order after three days' stormy
debate. - - -
For several years, it is said, the
death losses have averaged ibout
rl.010,000 more than the assessments,
as the organization operated under j
very low rates. Since last October!
the death losses have averaged $2- j
000,000 a month more than receipts. j
Two tables of rates were adopted '
at today's session, one for new mem-1
bera and the other for the present j
EiembersMp. The table tor new mem-j
bers is based upon the experience of j
tae Modern Woodmen of America and;
is inat eiially lower than the national j
iraternai insurance table of rates.
This will meet the requirements of
th adequate rate laws of the various
states. They are the increased fates
made by the head camp which met in
Chicago in 1912, but which already
repudiated later by the membership,
which .secured in injunctions Sn a
number oi states preventing their col
lection. The table for the present members
increases the present rates 50 per
cent, beginning with 7 cents per
$1,000 of insurance at ages of 17 to
18 and increases 5 per cent steps
until $1.50 is reached at the age of
08, above which the rate is station

(By Review Leased Wire)
CIXCIXNATI, March 26. Senator
Poindexter of Washington, republican,
addressing the. Business Men's club
here tonight, declared that the pro
posed League of Nations plan was
; "utterly intolerable"" in whatever form
it may be developed and was unac
ceptable to the senate and the Ameri
can people. ' He said '"union of action
and co-operation" was desirable, if it
did not involve "surrender of the in
dependence and -sovereignty-, of the
free nations of the world."
"Under the constitution of the
League of Nations or any constitution
based upon similar principles," said
Mr. Poindexter, "the autonomy and
self-determination of the individual na
tions would he absolutely destroyed.
In other words, while pretending to
preserve liberty it woum by this very
act at once destroy the liberties of
the world and set up a monstrous
military despotism in its place.
"Europe with its comaiunity of in
terests may feel that it can control
the proposed League of Nations and
undoubtedly it can; the United States,
however, with" a different set of inter
ests, having paid the fearful cost of
its entry. into the war against Ger
many to preserve liberty, would make
a monstrous mistake now to surren-
i der tha tvery liberty to a different
i form of world government in the shape
' of a League of Nations, with authority
to enforce its decrees upon the United

SCREEN PRODUCTION
SOON TO APPEAR HERE
' "The Common Cause," the first big
1 "after-the-war" screen production to
( be exhibited after the signing of the
armistice that made the world "safe
for Democracy," is to be shown here,
at. the Eagle Theater, for four days,
beginning Friday.
This screen sensation, which is the
latest triumph of J. Stuart Blackton,
to be brought before the public by the
.Vitagraph Company, one of the most
artistic and appealing photoplay
dramas. Herbert Rawlinson and
Sylvia Dreamer, two extremely popu-'
lar young stars, are featured at the
head of a cast which includes Huntley
Gordon, Lawrence Grossmith, the fa
mous musical comedy star; Charles
and Violet Blackton .children of the
producer; Philip Van lorn, Louis
Dean and Mile. Marcel, a well-known
French actress. V
The drama has a prologue and epi
logue, In which appear five famous
women of the stage 'iitie Shannon.
Julia Arthur, Irene Castle, Marjorie
Rambeau and Violet Heming. They
represent, respectively, Belgium, Italy,
France, Columbia and Britannia.
"This is one of the best-made pho
toplays ever produced and it certainly
has everything about it to make it the
greatest screen entertainment that has
come out in many months. It covers
the war from the time Belgium was
ravaged until the present time, with
the American and Allied, arms victo
rious; and yet it is not Avhat would
be called a 'war picture. It tells the
story of Allied aims, the reasons for
the entrance into tho struggle of Bri
tain, France, Italy, America, etc., and
shows how the American . marines
turned the tide of the war at the
memorable battle of Chateau-Thierry
by turning the Huns off the road to
I'arii. There is a splendid novelty
in the form of an animated diagram
showing this phase o fthe war.
"There is a beautiful love story

CHURCH DIRECTORS
SUED BY CHRISTIAN
Litigation Begun to Determine
Which Set of Trustees
Has Authority
(Ilv Review Leased Wire) j
BOSTON, March 26. Litigation has
been started in the rIassachusetts su
preme court to determine which of !
two sets of trustees appointed by the
late Mrs. Mary Baker G. Eddy has
authority over the Christian Science
Publishing society. On pelition oi tne
trustees of the society, the court has
issued a temporary injunction restrain
ing the directors of the First Church
of Christ, Scientist, from taking any
action intended to interfere witn the
trustees in the discharge of their
duties and from attempting to compel
any of the trustees yo resign.
The bill sets forth that Mrs. Eddy,
as founder of the Christian Science
movement .determined to put into the
hands of different sets ci trustees the
organization of Christian Science
churches and the work of circulating
of Christian Science publications. It
declares that the trustees of the pub
lishing society have heiG and managed
the property which came to them un
der the deed of trust of 1SSS, 'ex
clusively for the purpose declared and
defined! therein and solely for the
promotion and extension of the re
ligion of Christian Science as taught
by Mrs. Eddy."
The plaintiffs assert that the af
fairs of the society have been highly
prosperous and successful, and that
they have paid over to the defendants
in their capacities as directors and
trustees more than $450,000 as earn
ings and profits from their conduct
of the trust for a period of six months,
ending October 1 ,191S. They point
out that the defendants are directors
only of the First Church, known as
the Mother Church, and have no of
ficial control of the more than 1,800
Other Christian Science churches and
societies.
They declare that the directors, J
since the death of Mrs. Eddy, "have j
been gradually endeavoring to assume
and exercise powers with regard to!
tie publishing society, which the di
rectors never assumed or attempted
to exercise during the lifetime of Mrs.
Eddy."
Within the last few months, the
plaintiffs say, ."The directors have re
peatedly insisted that the board of
trustees (of the publishing society)
should make frequent, "specific and
public admission thai, the directors
v.-ere the supreme and rinal authority
with reference to all the affairs of the
publishing society and the managers
of the trust created by the trust deed
of 1S9S."

UP' BOYS AND HALTS
RUBBERY OF STORE
Youth Attempting to Rob
Proprietress, of Candy
Shop Frustrated
Probably only her long residence
in the "wrld and wooley" west, during
"which time she has witnessed many
exciting times, saved Mrs. Ida McCam-
ly, proprietress of the Busy Bee candy
shop, from being held up and robbed
by two youths Tuesday night. The
adventure, as told by her last night,
was this:
Two youths entered her shop after
closing hours Tuesday night and asked
for some candy. She asked the youths
ho they had managed to enter trie
store and they replied that the door
was open. Mrs. McCamly, however,
distinctly remembered she had locked
the door.
While she was waiting on one of the
youths, the other slipped into another
room without being noticed, and the
youth at the counter was ready to
leave. Mrs. McCamly then missed the
second youth. She was advised by the
man in the store to look in the 'dark
room and she might find him in there.
Realizing it was a plan to get her
in the dark room, Mrs. McCamly
reached for a pistol and pointing it at
the youth demanded him, to call his
chum, which he did, and the youth in
hiding immediately left the dark room
