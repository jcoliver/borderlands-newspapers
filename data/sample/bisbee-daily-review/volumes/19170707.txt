Gompers and Roosevelt Welcome
With Bitter Clash Over East St.
LABOR LEADE
CREATE EXCITEMENT WHEN
RAGE TROUBLE IS AIRED
NEW YORK, July 6. Denial by Samuel Gompers, president
of the American Federation of Labor, that trades unions
had any share in the East St. Louis race riots which was
met by a vehement denunciation by Theodore Roosevelt of
the murder of helpless negroes, precipitated a tumultous de
monstration at a mass meeting
night in honor or the Kussian mission to the United btates.
Mr. Roosevelt was interrupted by Mr. Gompers who rose
from his seat and approached the former president.
"Why don't you accuse after an investigation?" the labor
leader demanded.
With these- words he returned to his seat. Roosevelt
strode over to his chair and exclaimed:
Big Army Nation's
"Mr. Gompers, why don't I accuse af
terwards? I'll answer now when mur
der is to be answered!" With that the
colonel brought down on Mr. Gompers'
shoulder bis open left hand which he
had raised above his head. At this
juncture many of the men on the plat
form leaped to their feet and there
was a storm of hisses, cheers and
"boos" from all parts of the house.
When Ir. Roosevelt could make hii
self beard above the din, he went on:
"I will go to any extreme to bring
justice to the laboring man but when
there is murder I will put him down."
When the former president had fin
ished. Mr. Gompers, evidently deeply

Mayor Mitchell, who presided, pound

fort to restore order. Several minutes
elapsed before it was possible to intro
duce Boris A. Bakhmetieff, the Rus
sian ambassador, and continue the
meeting. As the excitement subsided,
Mr. Roosevelt and Mr. Gompers found
themselves sitting side by side.

Mr. Roosevelt then welcomed the

Asked if he would make a state

Mr. Roosevelt said:

"How bout the slap on Mr. Gom

A NERVOUS VREGK
From Three Years' Suffering. Say
Cardui Made Her WelL
Texas City, Tex. In an interesting
statement, Mrs. 0. H. Schill, of this town,
says: "For three years I suffered untold
agony with my head. I was unable to
do any of my woik.
I just wanted to sleep all the time, for
that was the only ease I could get, when
I was asleep. I became a nervous wreck
just from the awful suffering with my
head.
I was so nervous that the least noise
would make me jump out of my bed. I
had no energy, and was unable to do
anything. My son, a young boy, had to
do all my household duties.
I was not able to do anything until I
took Cardui. I took three bottles in all,
and it surely cured me of those awful
headaches. That has been three years
ago, and I know the cure is permanent,
for I have never had'any headache since
taking Cardui. . .
Nothing relieved me until I took Cardui.
It did wonders for me."

Many officials believe there th"i:!;l
be a closer control of outgoing cables,
and legislation to that end may be
asked. It is possible also tnat power
will be sought to censor outgoing
mails.
Postmaster1 General Burleson said to
day that he was opposed to any mall
censorship to neutral countries 'jn tae
ground that it is not necessary.
Communication to Spain probably
will be first involved by this govern

BY REVIEW
(By Review Leased Wire.)
NEW YORK, July 6. The short in
terest which seems to have reached
fofjiildable proportions indulRnd in
further determined efforts to depress
quoted values today. For a time heavy
offerings of important stocks forced
the list to lowest levels of the present
movement, the decline being aided by
greater weakness in speculative issues
long under critical observation.
Prices rebounded in the last half of
the session, many leaders finishing at
net gains. Labor problems and the
undefined attitude of the administra
tion toward general Industries served
to check constructive operations.
Automobile stocks furnished more
than their usual quota to the day's
moderate turnover, the status of that
industry, according to trade authorities
finding reflection in the heaviness of
the better known issues.
All the prominent equipments were
firm to strong at times, but forfeited
their gains when' selling became ex
tensive. United States Steel and
kindred shares Improved on covering
of the short contracts.
Rails pursued a narrow but stady
course, responding to such support as
developed at irregular intervals. Met
als were steady despite the expansion
ol labor troubles.
Sales 590,000 shares.
Trading in bonds was irregular on
diminished dealings in internationals.
Liberty 3's ranged from par to 10-
3-50. LT. S. bonds were unchanged on
call. Total sales, par value. $2,275.
000. CHICAGO GRAINS.
CHICAGO. July G Withdrawal of
European and domestic cash buyers
forced a setback in the corn market
today after high price records had
been touched despite ;aetion of the
board of trade directors stopping all
new business in the July delivery. The
market closed weak at the same as
yesterday's finish to 1- lower with
September 1.54 to 1.54T and De
cember at 1.14 to 1.14i. Wheat
finished unsettled with gains of 2 to
3 cents at 2.12 for July and 1.92 for
September. Oats lost 1 to 2 net
and provisions five to 15 cents.
Inferences that an extreme shortage
of corn existed drove traders at first
into a buying stampede for nearly an
hour and sent values climbing rapidly.
It was not until word was passed that
exports in general and the chief
American industrial consumers as well
had quit'buying that the flurry could
be overcome. Aggressive bear pres
sure then set in and all the big gains
which had been made early were lost
with considerable more besides.
Wheat not only responded to tho
stimulus of the corn bulge but devel
oped strength owing to less favorable
crop reports from the northwest. The
damage was said to have been by re
cent droughts in Canada and there
were advices that rain was badly need
ed in the Dakotas and Minnesota.
Heavy selling of oats by leading
commission houses weakened that
cereal almost from the outset. Fav
orable crop conditions gave much im
petus to bearish sentiment.
Provisions swayed with the varying
action of corn. Demand for meats was
said to have improved somewhat but
to be less than usual for this time of
the year.

BRADSTREET'S REPORT.
NEW YORK, July 6. Bradstreefs
will say tomorrow:
A shifting or readjusting process,
born of war conditions, tends to re
press operations in some channels,
while at the same time stimulating a
wide range of war lines to greater
animation. Yet what might be term
ed regular distributive . business is
large, and though it is conceded that
there is not the snap to buying that
was so remarkable six months ago,
faith in the future of trade is only
tempered by concern over govern
mental regulation of prices or by
present uncertainty as to the full ef
fects of readjustments now making.
Ho wfar these readjustments will go
and what lines will be most repressed
hile expansion grows in the indus
tries that are essential to warfare is
the leading question. However, the
main developments of the week are
favorable, nothwithstanding that the
larger lines evince seasonable quiet.
Warm weather and July clearances
has been stimulated by retail which
in turn has made for some re-orders
and industry is active as ever, being
held back only by shortage of labor
or raw materials.
Week bank clearings. $5,950,383,000.
COMMERCIAL BULLETIN.
BOSTON. July 6. The Commercial
Bulletin will say tomorrow:
Except for the sale of a sizeable
line of secured fine cape wool past
week in the Boston market has been
very dull. Prices hold fairly steady,
however, for everything.
Possibly the trade is a bit more
optimistic as to the future but the
attitude of the federal government as
to noils and waste is restraining trade
in wools.

NEW YORK. July 6. The tone of
the market was somewhat improved
today and it was rather apparent that
liquidation of the past few days has
strengthened the technical position.
Effort of the professional element con
tinued the bulk of the dealings and in
the final hour some of the leading
room shorts showed a disposition to
retire commitments. There was no
news of broad significance in circu
lation although peace rumors were be
ing passed around and lacking official
continuation. Gold continues to be
imported lrom Canada on a rather
large scale and is reflected in an
easier tendency in the money market
However, at this time with so much
uncertainty over the political situa
tion and legislative efforts at Wash
ington substantial interests seem to be
pursuing a course of indifference and
more inclined to let the price in se
curities take its own course.

SCORN UPON HEAD OF
LATE FLAG INSULTER
Actions And Words of Late
Son of Hellas, Who Per
formed On City Streets
Tuesday Night, Denounced
For His Words.
That ths Greeks of the Warren Dis
trict feel very keenly the reflection
upon their race, due to the actions of
one of the number last Tuesday night,
is shown by the following communi
cation from one of the colony in this
city:
"When the Greeks of New York City
alone organized 15,000 young Greeks
for the defense of Old Glory; when the
founder of the Greek National Herald,
Mr. Pete Tatanis, organized two Com
panies and paid the men from his own
treasury; and after a half-million
Greeks through the United States hold
a record for their patriotism toward
their adopted land, here appears a hu
man monster to stigmatize the Grecian
History.
"The person, who does not respect a
flag does not belong to any country,
but belongs to the earth as a mush
room, which grows with, the first rain
of the season. Not only the American
flag has been established by the most
gallant heroes and philosophers of the
American people, but every flag has
been established by the same princi
ples, and tor that raeson we must re
spect the flags and especially the one
for which we swtore faithfully to
serve as adopted sons. '
"No matter if this man is guilty or
not. He has disgraced bis Grecian
name by his action. No matter from
which mountains he came, the Grecian
people of this community denounce
him, and will anathematize him here
and in the hereafter."
Attack On Tener Is

NEW YORK. July 6. The board of
directors of the National League did
not take any action during the re-hearing

journed the session for one week, so
as to give Manager McGraw of the
New York Giants an opportunity to
produce two witnesses from Pittsburg
next Friday.
The four newspaper men who wrote
the interviews in which Manager Mc
Graw was said to have cast reflections
on President J. K. Tener of the Na

Manager McGraw, who repudiated
the interviews, also gave testimony
and said if given an opportunity to do
so he could produce two Pittsburg
men who were present at the time he
is said to have been interviewed by
the reporters.

MICHIGAN BELLE
Local Man Who Graduates
From University of Machi
gan Law Department This
Year Takes Unto Himself
a Bride.
John Sanders. Bisbee native and
well known in the Warren District, is
a benedict. It has come as a decided
surprise to his many friends in this
community.
Saunders has been a student at the
University of Michigan ror several
years, taking a law course from which
he graduated June 29. It is understood
that he will return to Arizona to prac
tice law and may be expected within
the next few weeks.
One of the papers of Three Rivers.
Mich., printed the following about the
wedding of the Bisbee man:
"Yesterday morning at the home of
the bride's mother. Mrs. Gertrude
Stout, occurred the marriage "of Miss
I Helen B. Stout to John E. Sanders, of
! Bisbee, Arizona. The wedding was a
i simple one with only a few intimate
friends and relatives present to wit
ness the ceremony, which was per
' formed by the Rev. Wilinot E. Stevens.
The bride wore an attractive gown -of
; white with a corsage bouquet of La
France roses, following the ceremony
and congratulations a three-course
; wedding breakfast was served. The
out-of-town guests were Mr. and Mrs.
Hartsuck and young son, Paul, of Ken
dallville, Ind., relatives of the bride;
Miss Blance Campbell, of Seattle.
Wash., a cousin, and Mr. and Mrs. Carl
Rehm. of Sturgis.
"Mrs. Sanders has always called Con
stantine home and her many friends
here are wishing her well in her new
home in the southwest. She graduat
ed from the Constantine High school
in the class of 1912, and two years lat
er received her diploma from the Ypsi
lanti Normal college. She then ac
cepted an excellent position in South
Haven and last year taught in the pub
lic schools of Kalamazoo.
"Those who know him in Ann Arbor
say that "Jack" Sanders is 'one of the
best liked men on the varsity campus.
Today he will receive his sheepskin
from the law department of the Uni
versity of Michigan and will later
practice his profession in his native
town of Bisbee. Ariz. Mr. Sanders has
been the treasurer of the senior laws,
has been manager of the varsity track
team the past year, in this position re
flecting honor on himself and his class.
He is a member of the Sigma Alpha
Epsilon fraternity, the Barristers and
other Organizations.
"Mr. and Mrs. Sanders left Constan

in South Haven and spend a few days
at Klinger Lake, where they have
passed many a delightful hour togeth
er. They then go to Tucson, Ariz., to
be the guests for a few days of Mr.
and Mrs. Fay Fish, who are planning
on taking them Xm to Bisbee in their
car.
"A number of delightful social func

Saturday Morning, July 7, 1917.
"Hands across the seas" has a new and most sinister
meaning these troubled days. They are the hands of the
rioter and striker and agitator and spy stretched forth
from American shores to clasp hands with the Kaiser
and his junkers.
. It cost a little more than nine millions to feed the U.
S. fighting forces last year; it will cost 133 millions this
year. It cost 875 thousand dollars for small arms last
year; it will cost 148 millions of dollars this year. This
nation is at war!
One of the Bisbee strike leaders declared the other
day that the red card of membership in the L W. W. was
better than a Liberty Bond. Maybe so; maybe so. But
the seventy-eight slackers from Rockford, Illinois, who
were sentenced to a year's Imprisonment at hard labor
would doubtless prefer more liberty and less treason if
they had it to do over again.
- U. S. Senator Sherman of Illinois declared in the open
senate yesterday that part of the blame for the Eat
Saint Louis, Illinois, race riots can be placed with con
fidence upon the L W. W. and most of the balance upon
liquor. Many lives were lost In the rioting and much
property destroyed. But this is in-line with the past
record of John Barleycorn and the I. W. W.
From letters found upon German prisoners captured
recently on the British front comes the first news to the
rest of the world of a disastrous powder mill explosion
somewhere in Westphalia. One of these letters spoke
of the grief of a German mother who had lost four son ;
on the field of battle and three daughters in this powder
explosion. Great heavens, what a blow! Seven chil
dren taken by, the war. Only a mother can conceive
what this German woman has placed upon the altars of
Hohenzollern ambition.
At Calumet, Michigan, the other day, the advance guard
of the I. W. W. swarm descended upon the town and
started to hold a meeting for the purpose of engndering
strike baccillL But the Calumet citizens beat them to it.
They "broke up that first meeting and gave the hums a
few hours to leave town. Result: No strike at Calumet.
"Don't Let 'em Light;" that's a good slogan for Arizona
as regards these labor agitators of all kinds, brands an 'J
descriptions while this nation is at war and the country
is full of Prussian spies and agents.
In Los Angeles they have formed a "California Avia
tion company," capitalized at $600,000, and propose to
build hundreds of airplanes for service in France. This
is only one of a score of such concerns. American enter
prise nd industrial genius has already started in to drive
the black Prussian eagle from the air-but wait! Ths
English and French fliers have already done that we
will launch our air, fleets at Essen and Dusseldorf and
Cologne and Hamburg and Berlin. The airplane versus
the submarine; which will win the war?
Berlin official circles and newspapers maintain that
noAmerican soldiers have landed in France. They de
clare that only a few hospital units and engineers have
been sent there for "show purposes." This is in line
with the German Imperial policy of feeding the German
people only with victories for the Germans and disasters
for German enemies. It is also in line with some of the
stuff that I. W. W. leaders and soapbox orators are feed
ing their dupes in this copper strike. Ye gods, what an
awakening there be at some not far distant day!
In New York City a batch of shipbuilders are demand
ing $4.50 per day for their skilled labor. In BiHbee there
are a considerable number of miners who will not work
for $5.50 a day. It would seem to the simple layman
that Bisbee was putting on considerable airs when some
of her workmen turn up their noses at a dollar a day
more wages than skilled New York workers are still work
ing for. Speaking of "downtrodden labor," and that is all
the anarchist orators ever speak of, where do you get
that "downtrodden" business? There's a million men In
New York that would jump at our little old Five-fifty
wage scale like a hungry dog at a porterhouse T Bone.
THE "LITTLE RED CARD." j
(From the El Paso Times.) j
No self-respecting laboring man ever identified himself '
with the I. W. W. The aims of that organization nega
tives the idea of labor and loyalty to any cause which is
founded on honor and fair dealing. The members are
not American, because they do not believe in our form of
i
government. Where they are found in any considerable
i
number, there is left a record of disturbances and terror!
and even bloodshed. They teach the doctrine of dis-j
obedience to the laws of the country and disrespect for
the men who are charged with their enforcement. They j
have operated for years along the Pacific coast, and we
read of dynamiting and shooting and rioting, with their
toll of innocent lives and immense property loss. They
appear in the farming regions of the northwest and
leave a trail of devastation. They congregate in towns
and small cities and demand that they be the guests of
the people and are run out by the officers and the home
guards, but not, generally, until some are injured, if not
killed, and more or less damage is done. At no time and
in no place is there any evidence of this organization
working. If any of them take positions it is for the
purpose of stirring up strife and discontent, and if they
get into the right place a strike soon follows.
The "little red card" is a most suitable emblem of this
band of ruffians and barbarians. It is the emblem of
anarchy and terror and bloodshed. One can easily under
stand how men of this calibre can be made the tools of
Prussian agents in this country. They do not need any
persuading, for they are already hostile to our govern
ment and are constantly seeking to undermine it. There
is nothing to which they will not stoop for a dollar, and
knowing this they are enlisted in the cause of the enemy
to cripple the country, which gives them shelter, in its
war for liberty. Mr. Moyer declares the organization
hasn't any money in its treasury, and he might truth
fully have added that it never did have any money in
its treasury, unless It were put there by some one who
bad a dirty work to be performed by its members; for it
is a well-known fact that it could not get there through
the medium of dues and assessments. The I. W. W. is
the great unwashed combination of human derelict which
has adopted those letters for its motto and which means
I Wont Work."
In Arizona, their present field of operation, they are
doing everything in their power to cripple the Industries
of the state and to hinder the government in war. They
are traitors to their country and to every good thin,;
vouchsafed to those who love their homes and are, true
to their obligations. There is no place in the United
States for such a class of men. 'They have on. claim
for protection under any law. They are outcasts, self
made, and a most obnoxious tumor on the body politic.
The should be suppressed without mercy and driven out
of the" United States deported, if possible, to the countrv
whose cause they have espoused.
If This Be Treason,
Hake theMost of It
President Chas. H. Moyer of the
Mine Workers: "The Industrial
Workers of the World has had no
money in its treasury. It seems
to have plenty of money now.
Where it got this money 1 cannot
say. The public may-speculate as
it. There is no doubt the Indus
trial Workers of the World are try
ing to put us in a bad light with
the Arizona operators. If there
should be any violence in Arizona
I lay it at the door of the I. W. W.
Did it ever occur to you, Mr. Bisbee Striker, that the
real object of the I. W. W. leaders of the strikes in Ari
zona is to cripple the mining output and not to secure
better conditions and more pay for the miners? There is
much real evidence already developed from these strikes
to prove that this is the case. For instance, at Globe, the
I. W. W. leaders have refused to allow pumpmen to work
on the Old Dominion mine. Every miner knows that if
the pumps of this mine are idle long enough the mine
will be flooded, and this may well mean a forced shut
down for vera s. This act at Globe is the act of an agent
of Germany rather than the act of a friend of the Arizona
miners. How can any striking miner ever be benefitted
by the destruction of a mine? His job in that mine is
gone forever. This matter of stopping the pumps at the
Old Dominion is significant. Stop and think it over.
Does it look like the act of a real friend of organized
labor? How will such tactics help you, Mr. Miner, to bet
ter wages or better conditions or better anything? You
vlll simply have to move on. Your leaders, by their acts.
seek destruction. That is the creed of only two organiza
tions in the world today, the German Imperial government
and the I. W. W. Think it over carefully, and then esti
mate your personal profits that can possibly come from
a strike under such leadership.
t
Dispatches from Globe narrate, among other things
I hat do not sound very good to the average American,
that an Austrian, a leader of the strikers, cursed the
sheriff and threatened him with death if he crossed the
nicket line again. Austria is at war with America. She
cannot invade this country. If she tried, we would
tight her off with every man and gun we could muster.
But we are so tolerant in the matter of labor troubles
that this alien of the race of our enemies can check our
flow of munitions to the battle line and threaten our
county officials with death and still strut about upon our
soil, a free man.
FIGHT ON DRY CLAUSE
OF FOOD MEASURE TO
BE LAUNCHED TODAY
Debate of Speakers On Sec
tion Limited To Ten Min
utes; Cloture Rule May Be
Invoked For Final Vote.
(By Review Leased Wire).
WASHINGTON. July 6 With a re
sort to cloture rule threatened the
senate by unanimous consent late to
day a r reed to begin consideration of
the proibition section, and of any
amendments or substitutes of the food
bill, at 2 o'clock tomorrow afternoon
with debate limited.
-Final disposition of the prohibition
issue before adjournment tomorrow
night and passage of the bill next
week is deemed assured. Senator
Chamberlain, In charge of the meas
ure, announced that Saturday he
would seekj another unanimous con
sent agreement for a final vote not
later than Wednesday or Thursday,
and believed it would be obtained
without using the cloture motion. Forty-two
senators have signed the clo
ture measure, whieh required only 15
signatures.
Speakers Limited.
When the prohibition question is
taken up tomorrow each speaker will
be limited to 10 minutes upon the
Gore prohibition amendment, prohib
ting the mainufacture of distilled bev
erages during the war and giving the
president authority to suspend manu
facture of malt, fermented or vinous
intoxicants and to limit their alco
holic contents. Upon amendments and
substitutes for the Gore plan, each
senator's debate will be limited to five
minutes. ,
All the formal steps for a decisive
struggle on prohibtion have been
taken. Senator Robinson introduced
the so-called "administration compro
mise" substitute today for the Gore
plan, providing only that distillation of
foodstuffs for intoxicating beverages
shall cease. v
Amendment Adopted.
Private polls of the senate, leaders
of both factions admitted privately to
night, indicate a large majority for the
Robinson sustitute.
After agreeing to proceed with the
liquor fight tomorrow, the senate late
today adopted Senator Kenyoti'9
nmendment to a section of the bill
greaitly extending the government's
power to purchase and sell supplies
to secure reasonable prices. Under the
amendments, in addition to foods, feed
and fuel, the government would be au
thorized to buy and sell ,at minimum
prices fixed by the federal authorities,
all other "necessaries" named in the
bill.
A determined effort will be made to
broaden it so as to insure that the
government will have power to regu
late coal priees and to take over and
operate coal mines.
Sherman Changes Mind.
Senator Pomerene of Ohio made a
lengthy speech to day on the coal situ
ation, reciting alleged exorbitant coal
priees and necessity for government
regulation.
Prohibition also came in for some
attention. Senator Thomas, of Col
orado, advocated na'ional prohibition
"when squarely and fairly presented",
but announced opposition to the pro
posal for immediate "bone-dry pro
hibition because both of effect on pub
lic sentiment and from the revenue
standpoint.
Senator Sherman, of Illinois, who
has not been regarded as an ardent
prohibition advocate announced that
hereafter he is a "bone-dry" senator
"because of saloon influence in the
East St. Louis race riots."

It has been found necessary to send troops to an Ari

and destruction. That is the well known 1. W. W. brand.

Probed By Flynn
(By Review Leased Wire.)
DOUGLAS. July 6. A telegram re
reived this afternoon by General II.
A. Greene, commander of the Arizona
district, from Thomas Flynn, United
States district attorney for Arizona at
Phoenix, said Mr. Flynn would leave
at once for Globe to investigate arrests
made and prosecute any violation to
federal laws.
General Greene said messages re-
This sounds good, from Julius Kahn of California. Ger
man, born, hut now a loyal citizen of the United States:
"The patriotic American of German birth may well sny

country.' "
had a quieting effect and no trouble
was anticipated by the commanding
officer there.
(By Review Leased Wire.)
JEROME, July 6. It was estimated
that about 250 miners failed to report
at the various copper mines in the
Jerome district as a result of a strike
order issued by the Industrial Work
ers of the World organization.
Industrial Workers of the World to
day called a strike on copper miner
here, effective at 3 o'clock this after
noon, to enforce demands identical
with those presented at Globe by men
on strike there. Immediately after the
strike was called notices were posted
by the Jettmie local of the Interna
tional Union of Mine, Mill and Smelter
Workers informing members the
strike action was taken without au
thority and the union could not recog
nize the order. The question of re
sponding to the call was left to each
man to decide for himself.
A meeting fcf the Jerome local of
the International union was called for
tonight for the purpose of voting as to
whether the union should make the
same demands as the I. W. W. had
presented. W. McClusky. organizer of
the International union, said he had
not heard of a "single member Vf the
union favoring a strike."
Same Old Demands.
The demands made by the I. W. V.
include the following conditions;
Six-hour day for all underground
men; minimum wage of f a day for
underground workers and $5.50 for
surface men: two men at all drills: at
least two men shall work underground
in all places: abolition of sliding scale
contract system and bonus work:
change rooms with hot and cold show
er: no armed meu employed at any
time: no discrimination against uuiou
men and abolition of physical exam
ination. The strike of union miners here la: t
May was settled June 3. It did not
involve the wage scale. The compan
ies agreed to recognize the grievance
committees elected by the employes;
not to discriminate against union men,
and to co-operate with employes nn
the lowering of the scale of liiug
costs.
As you recall the brave deeds of our
ancestors who fought for independence,
it is well also to consider the importance
of financial independence.

DETROIT. July 6. Bunching two
doubles, a triple and a single with
two eriOrs in the fourth, Detroit won
the final game of the series with Chi
cago. Dauss, although allowed 12 hits,
scattered them and would have scored
a shutout hut far Bush's error in tlip
eighth. CObb broke his batting streak j
of 35 games by going hitless in four
times at bat
Faber and Scott were the pitchers
who stopped Cobb. The former has
always been a difficult proposition for
the Detroit star to solve. He recently
held Cobb hitless until the Georgian
came to bat for the last time. Then
Ty beat out a bunt Faber, during his
major league career, has held Cobb to
a' batting average or less than .2S5.
The late Addie Joss was the only
pitcher who had greater success
against the great slugger.
Cobb was at bat three times against
Faber today. On his last trip to the
plate, Jim Scott opposed him and
Cobb's effort was a grounder to Weav
er. Cobb began his hitting streak
against Cleveland on Decoration Day.
He averaged .500 during the eastern
trip and continued his terrific hitting
when the Detroit club returned to the
west.

P. P. Pitchlynn, supervisor of the

states that the report that Rustler's
park and other popular camping plac
es in the Chiricahuas were destroyed

These points were not touched by the
flames. Because of the hard work of
the soldiers and civilian fire fighters,
all the camping sites in the mountains
were saved a swell as valuable timber

Let no act of yours tend to do

his authority and this applies to ev
