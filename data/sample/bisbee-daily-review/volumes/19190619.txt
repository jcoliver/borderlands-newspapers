DOOM OF DAYLIGHT

of daylight saving, inaugurated
as a war measure was pronounced
today by congress, both senate and
house adopting by overwhelming
votes measures to terminate ope
ration of the law when the period
of summer time end3 next Octo

The house by a vote of 233 to
132 passed a bill to repeal the law
on the last Sunday in next Octo
ber, but rejected an amendment to '
make the repeal effective at once.
The senate by a vote of 56 to

McCumber Splits Ranks of
G. 0. P. League Opposition
WASHINGTON, June 18. The
League of Nations was supported In
the senate today by Senator IcCum
ber of North Dakota, a Republican
member of the foreign relations com
mittee, who urged in a three hour
speech that the league covenant of
fered a just and practicable plan for
the preservation of world peace.
Senator McCumber replied to argu
ments of Senator Knox o Pennsyl-vairta,--'Bnd
- other - Republican leaders
and declared he could not be influ
enced against the league plan by party
considerations. - .
"Partisan that I am," he asserted,
"I hope I shall never be so hide-bound
or so blinded by party exigencies as to
oppose a just position taken or a truth
declared by a member of any opposi
tion party. I could not cast my vote
against any reasonable plan for the
preservation of world peace without
a conviction that would follow me to
the grave that I have committed an
unpardonable offense against all fu
ture generations."
Senator McCumber charged there
had been a campaign of misrepresenta
tion against the league. He opposed
as a proposal calculated "to sound
the death knell of any scheme to pre
serve peace" the resolution of Sen
ator Knox which would declare the
senate's opposition to accepting the
league covenant along with the peace
treaty. '
- The speech aroused no debate, but
while the senate was at work most
of the day on appropriations there was
much maneuvering in preparation for
the fight expected Friday or Saturday
to force a showdown of senate opinion
regarding the league.
Some progress was made, however,
on plans to co-ordinate the speaking
tours of senators who will reply to
President Wilson when he goes before
the country early next month to ap
peal for support of the . league. Al
though these plans' have not reached
a definite stage, Senator McCumber,

Members of both senate and

they were gflilded largely by
wishes of farmers and laboring
men who oppose the advanced

of the repeal legislation, declared
the extra hourj of daylight was a
boon to city dwellers and asserted

Govt, At One Fell Swoop"
Flynn, Palmer, Tell Of Plot;
Say July 4th Is Not Day;
Ask $500,000 Bomb Fund
. -
WASHINGTON, June 18. The
menace of bomb outrages still hangs
over the country, in the belief of of
ficials of the department of justice.
William J. Flynn, chief of the de
partment's bureau of Investigation,
said today he believed there were
"more bombs to come," but said it
was impossible to say when the next
attempt to create a reign of terror
by explosions might be made.
Palmer Asks for $500,000
The department tonight made pub
lic the testimony of Attorney Gener
al Palmer before the house appropri
ations committee asking for a spe
cial fund of $500,000 to carry on the
hunt for radicals. The attorney
general told -the committee govern
ment officials had been advised of a
day set for another attempt by rad
icals "to destroy the government at
one fell swoop."
"We have received so many
notices and gotten so much infor
mation," Mr. Palmer said, "that
it has almost come to be accept
ed as a fact that on a certain day
in the future, which we have
been advised of, there will be
another serious and probably,
much larger effort of the same
character which the wild follow
ers of this movement describe as
revolution, a proposition to de
stroy the government at one fell
swoop.
"Mr. Flynn said he knew of no
plot planned for Independence day
and asserted every precaution was
being taken by police throughout the
Unitel States."
"I know the source from which the
j bomb operators have come," Mr.
Flynn said. "The agitation is pure
ly dramatic and" has no foreign con
nections although there may be some
foreigners active in it."
Mr. Flynn said investigation of the
recent attempt made on the life of
Attorney General Palmer had reveal
ed that two men were involved and
that only a miscarriage of the plot
ters' plans prevented the attempt be
ing carried out successfully.
In tracing the source of the explos
ions, it has been established, he said,
that the man killed was in New Yoric
two weeks before he met his death,
but his identity still is unknown.
Many Arrests of Suspects
Arrests being made throughout the
country include many persons not
connected with the bomb outrage,
Mr. Flynn said, but who have been
under surveillance and are detained
for further investigation.
Responding to the attorney gener
al's plea, the house appropriations
committee today recommended that
the requested appropriation be grant
ed hy congress, the special fund to
be included among the items of the
sundry civil appropriations bill which
will be taken up tomorrow by the
house.

Votes Down "Reds" By

ATLANTIC CITY, N. J., June 18.
Radical and conservative delegates at
tending the reconstruction convention
of the American Federation of Labor
clashed again today. The contest,
which arose over a resolution propos
ing inauguration of a policy of initia
tive and referendum withia the ranks
of organized, labor, was marked by a
display of bitter feeling which, as was
the case yesteffiayrresnlteMn the-Tad-ical
element being crushingly def
eated. A vote on whether there should be
a roll call on the resolution disclosed
there were only 35 delegates out' of
about 500 favoring the measure. This
was interpreted as representing even
more than the maximum ratio of radi
cals within organized labor.
The clash developed after all the
delegates radicals as well a3 conserv
atives had adopted, unanimously a
resolution assailing Postmaster Gen
eral Burleson for his "labor policy"
and calling on President Wilson to
remove him. During the consideration
of the resolution the postmaster gen
eral was severely criticized by dele
gates and termed an "administrative
misfit." No delegate defended Mr.
Burleson.
As soon as the initiative and refereiv
dum resolution was reported, James
Duncan of Seattle, declared the mea
sure was for the benefit of "the rank
and file of workers." He accused the
resolutions committee which recom
mended non-concurrence in the mea
sure of being unprogressive and hold
ing the belief the rank and file was
not intelligent enough to consider Im
portant questions.
"You preach about democracy and
yet you won't have it in organized la
bor," hotly declared the delegate.

(By the Associated Press)
Nothing official has yet become
known as to what action the German
government will take regarding the

ment is being carefully studied by
the national assembly's peace com
mission. Unofficial reports are that there
is great dissatisfaction on the part
of the German cabinet members and
high German officTals over what are
'considered the extremely hard terms.
It is said a large majority of the cab
inet members are opposed to sign
ing the treaty, but are fearrul of a
reign of Bolshevism and consequent
chaos in the country should they de
cline. German newspapers take a dark
view of the outcome, whether Ger
many signs or not. Those newspa

the count should have been made at
that time.
Speakers declare the association
was willing to co-operate with forestry
officials aad, if at any time the cattle
can be worked without loss, they
would be willing to have the re-count.
The system of assessing fines was
condemned and the opinion expressed
that under the forest administration
no effort had been made to protect
the range, develop water, or regulate
grazing.
The meeting, whicll was attended by
cattlemen from Cochise, Pima and
Santa Cruz counties, was called by
Supervisor Bertard of Tucson, presi
dent cf the association, ia whose ab
sence Harry Suxon, former cattle in
spector of Santa Cruz county, presided.
CIRCUMSTANTIAL GUILT
VALID, COURT DECIDES
PHOENIX, June 18. Ival McCann
today lost his appeal to the state su
preme court against his conviction
in the superior court of Maricopa
county of second degree murder in
connection with the killing of Ken
neth C. Falston in November. 1917.
The biipreme court's decision,
handed down today, held that while
the evidence in the case all was cir
cumstantial, the circumstances were
such that the court believed Mc
Cann's guilt had been proved beyond
a reasonable doubt.
Uvidenre introduced at the trial
tended to show that Falston. who had
come to Phoenix for his health, had
last been seen in McCanu's company
after he had drawn $:) from his
bank.
McCann himself notified the sher
iff of Falston's disappearance und led
a "hunt" for him. Suspicion attach
ed to McCann. he was arrested and
discharged when Falston's body
could not be found. Five months
later when Falston's remains wre
discovered with a bullet hole in the
back of the skull. McCann again was
arrested aud tonucted hi July, 191S.
VILLISTAS THREATEN
t (Continued from Page One)
follow the discovery of arms or ammu
nition after the expiration of that
time, the proclamation stated. A civil
ian was arrested late today charged
with making anti-government state
ments to a crowd in the plaza. He
was said to have been criticizing Gen
eral Gonzales for permitting the Amer
ican troops to enter Mexico.
Captain del Arco, a brother of Col.
Francisco del Arco, shot and killed a
sergeant of his command tonight fol
lowing an argument as to what com
mand played the most important part
in the battle with Villa, according to
the officials.
VILLA NEAR OLD QUARTERS
EL PASO. June 18. Villa agents
here claimed late today to have re
ceived a communication from Villa's
column in the field southwest of
Juarez. They located the Villa head
quarters at a point near Villa Ahu
mada and said Villa still controlled
the railroad at that point. It was
admitted that a part of the Villa col
umn under Martin Lopez or Ramon
Vega, was moving into the Galeana
district but it was claimed that Villa
was near his former base at Villa
Ahumada yesterday.
Efforts were being made here today
to send letters to Villa from Amer
icans in El Paso stating that the sign
ers did not approve of the American
expedition to Juarez Sunday night.
So far as known tonight these letters
had not been sent. Several messages
protesting against the expedition
were sent to Washington today.
Among the leven prisoners being
held at the Fort Bliss stockade as
suspected Villa men, one is believed
to be a Villa staff officer. He gave
the name of Jesus Medina and claim
ed to be a Carranza officer of vColo-
nel del Arco's command. Upon In
vestigation it developed that the man
was not enrolled in del Arco's com
mand and was declared by the Car
ranza officials to be a Villa general
and a signer of the ranious Villa plan
of Rio Florida Issued in October,
1917. He is being held for further
investigation. The prisoners "were
brought from Mexico by American
troops Monday.
Supplementary reporis received at
military headquarters indicated that
the casualties caused by the Ameri
can rifle, machine gun and artillery
fire Sunday night and Monday was
more deadly than at first estimated.
Official information was received
from Juarez that many more bodies
were found in the wheatfield and in
the abandoned trenches and buried
there. It was also learned that the
federals buried 87 Villa men after the
first day's fighting and 123 after the
combined attacks of the federal
forces and the Americans Monday
morning.
Additional confirmation of sniping
from the Mexican 6ide by Villa reb
els was furnished the military today
by Colonel J. Gonzales Escobar, who
was wounded and is in an El Paso
hospital. He said he saw Villa snipers
fire into El Paso.
FEDERALS CLAIM 151 VILLA DEAD
JUAREZ, Mexico. June 18. Gener
al Francisco Gonzales with 932 men
defended Juarez against the attacks
of 1600 Villa forces, killing 151 Villa
rebels, including two Villa generals,
according to the official report given
out at military headquarters here.
The official list of government cas
ualties included six officers, 33 sol
diers and a number of civilians kill
ed, captured by Villa and missing.
One battalion had not reported when
this report was compiled at General
Gonzales' headquarters today.
The two Villa generals claimed to
have been killed were Manuel Castro
and Alberto Jiminez. They were
identified by papers on their bodies
and the insignias of rank on their
sombreros. One of Villa's personal
secretaries was also killed and a
large quantity of important corres
pondence taken, from the letter case
he carried. His identity has not
been established although be was be
lieved to have been Jose Juarieta,
Villa's private secretary. This cor
respondence included letters address
ed to Manuel Bonilla, of El Paso, a
former Villa cabinet official. Manuel
Diaz Lombardo, Villa's choice for
provisional president fend a number
of American business men in El Pa
so whose names were withheld. Cop
ies of these letters were made and
the originals sent to Mexico City.
Gen. Gonzales Good Dodger
Juarez is cleaning up the aftermath
of battle, burying the dead and re
placing broken windows and wreck
ed doors. Bullet holes are to bo seen
in all parts of the town. In 'the mil
itary headquarters the walls back of
General Gonzales' desk is punctured
with six bullet holes while the win
dows are shattered by bullets. Ex
cept for these scars of battle and an
unusual number of armed men in the
street, the old border town has re
sumed its peace time appearance.
The Carranza and Villa wounded
are being cared for in the White
Cross hospital, improvised from an
old billiard hall, where volunteer
nurses from the society of Juarez are
attending the wounded men. The
Villa wounded are receiving the same
treatment as the federal soldiers.
Forty-threei prisoners captured dur
ing the battle are confined in the fed
eral penitentiary awaiting trial on
charges of banditry in the civil
courts.
ELECTRICAL STRIKE
ON COAST IS THREAT
(Continued from Page One)
"We are fighting for the right of
collective bargaining, the same 'right
that the Postmaster General extended
to electrical workers," said S. J.
Konenkamp, president of the tele
graphers' union. He added that the
latest reports showed more workers
were idle than at any time since the
strike started.
Telegraph company officials assert
ed that business was not being de
layed noticeably in any district.
Union leaders said conferences In
Atlantic City by American Federation
of Lajbor officials probably would re
sult in placing the entire situation De
fore President Wilson.
Charles P. Ford, secretary of the In
ternational Brotherhood of Electrical
Workers, said the strike of telephone
operators and linemen in the Pacific
Coast district might be extended to
ether states included in that district
unless demands are met. He at
tributed the trouble to failure of tele
phone companies to abide by the post
master general's order permitting the
workers to bargain collectively.

U. 8. DRY Of) JULY
GALLONS iH IDE
BY EDWARD M.THIERRY
Saff Correspondent of N. E. A.
WASHINGTON', D. C., June IS.
War to the death is raging here at
home. "Whisky is the issue.
iiiooa is being shed in mountain
battles. Soon cities will be battle
grounds. It's the moonshine war.
Drama and melodrama enacted in
France are duplicated. And all the
customary thrills are the -war's by
product. Uncle Sam is fighting the moon
shiners. Revenue officers, armed
men who are the greatest sharp
shooters alive, are pitted against an
un-numbered army of lawless moun
taineers desperate men, who fight an
Indian style of warfare in defense of
what they believe to be their God
given right to make whisky out of the
com they grow.
The hunted moonshiner lies in am
bush and kills his pursuer without a'
qualm. Its spectacular, picturesque
and bloody this great civil waY in
which Old John Barleycorn i3 the
central figure and which no peace
treaty, no league of nations pact, can
stop. Even airplanes are to be used
to augment the government forces.
The law puts whisky in the down
and out class July 1. Prohibitionists
tell us the country goes dry then.
But anybody who knows anything
about the moonshine ' war will tell
you that Uncle Sam is fighting a los
ing battle against the moonshiners.
Half Million Gallons Monthly Liquor
Output
auo umtcu kjiaica win uui ,y u I
July 1. Even if prohibition agents
could seize and destroy the millions
of gallons of legally, distilled liquor
laid away for arid days there would
still be plenty of illicitly- distilled
whisky to slack the national thirst
Moonshiners are making at least
half a million gallons of moonshine
whisky a month right now!
They've been making whisky illicit
ly In increased quantities month by
month ever since the legal distillation
of whisky ceased on September 8,
1917.
After July 1. with the nation theor
etically dry and prices sky high, the
output of moonshine will increase
enormously.. '
Armed revenue agents have been
waging the moonshine war for genera
tions. Uncle Sam's men have killed
and wounded hundreds of moonshin-j
ers. They have Bent hundreds to the
penitentiary and have destroyed thou
sands of "stills."
This army killed more moonshin
ers, captured more of them and de
stroyed more stills in the past year
than in a Bcore of previous years.
And they haven't even put a deiit in
the moonshine industry. i
"Wildcatting" the illicit making of ,
whisky has doublad in the south '
since the passage of state prohibition
laws. Moonshiners otherwise known
a3 . "wildcatters" have their chief ,
habitat in the Appalachian mountains. 1
With them whisky-making is a tradi
tion, a matter of heredity a birth
right They cared nothing about the
old tax laws. They thought the gov
ernment didn't have a right to put a
tax on whisSy. No more do they care
about dry laws. . -r
Bullets vand Buckshot Fly as
Battle Rages
Bullets and buckshot pumped into
them for decades by Uncle Sam's
revenue army have failed to change
their convictions. They shoot back,'
venomously but they don't shoot ;
quite as straight as the revenue men. ,
Nine-tenths of the casualties in the!
unending moonshine war are among
the moonshiners.
Mountain moonshining has produc
ed millions of gallons of whisky. But
It has been a comparatively small
business compared to the industry
that is taking hold in the cities.
Moonshine "trusts' are blossoming
into being alj over the country. A
new type of "wildcatter" Is develop
ing. He's not as dangerous an adver
sary as the mountaineer. He's usual
ly "yellow" reluctant to use a gun
and correspondingly afraid of a gun.
But the city moonshiner has big fi
nancial backing. He's putting effi
ciency and wholesale methods Into
illicit making.
The government is planning to re
inforce its anti-moonshine army. It
will probably be doubled. They ex
pect to. win in the war against the
big moonshiner. But revenue men ad
mit they haven't a gnost of a chance
KEEP OFF PARALYSIS,
HARDENffl ARTERIES
"Alteratives which change by some
inexplicable manner certain morbid
conditions of the system are of great
benefit in nervous diseases, in paralys
is, arteriosclerosis, glandular tuber-c-es,
fistulous and carious ulcers."
Dr. Mason, in U. S. Dispensatory.

above and la therefore Indicated in pa

to put the small family still out of
business.
Fortunes ore going to be made in
the moonshine industry. One 110-
gallon still can turn out 150 gallons
of whisky a day. Mountainers now
get $G to $7 a gallon; city still own
ers $5 to $6 a gallon. That's an out
put of about $1000 a day.
Retail prices in the south run all
the way from $8 to $15 a quart. That
means a present maximum retail sell
ing price of $9000 for one day's "run"
of a 150-gallon still.
War Worse as Price of Moonshine
Soars
On the underground booez "ex
change" it is predicted that after
July 1 the price will soar as high as
$25 a gallon "f. o. b." the still!
They make mountain moonshine out
of corn meal, mostly. City "wildcat
ters" usually use sugar and molasses.
They can make high proof whisky
160 proof, or 80 per cent aleohol.
And a rectifier of spirits can make six
gallons grow where one gallon ex
isted before.
A blind man can see from these
figures that Old John Barleycorn
hasn't lost his grip even if the nation
is going "dry."
These figures and the predictions
of the growing scope of the industry
and the alarming situation existing
in the moonshine war, are authorita
tive. I got them directly from reve
nue agents, chiefs and deputies in the
service, and from moonshiners and
bootleggers.
Revenue men have no illusions
about the big job Uncle Sam is going
to have. It isn't settled yet which
branch of the government is going to
try to enforce nation-wide prohibi
tion. But the revenue service is lay
ing plans to stem the big "offensive."
The best guess i3 that the department
of justice will take over the job
with the revenue raiding force, the
experienced men who have been fight
ing moonshiners for years, transferred
to this branch from the treasury de
partment Airplanes to Help U. S. RevenUe Army
Soldiers may be used to help. It
has been suggested that airplanes be
employed. It has practicallyvbeen de
cided to make tests of the airplane's
efficiency in hunting moonshiners.
Veteran revenue men' agree that
the legalized use of beer and wine
would greatly diminish moonshining;
thai leniency in the courts and the
imposition of state dry laws have in
creased moonshining.
"There are many more illicit whis
ky stills in the country now than ever
before," said H. W. Mager of Wash
ington, acting chief of revenue agents
of tho treasury department, and head
of TTnolo Sani's anti-moonshine army.
"It will be worse after nation-wide
prohibition goes into effect. It's al
most Impossible to estimate the num
ber of illicit stills now in operation.
The number must be way up in the
thousands.

Appalachian mountains alone have de
stroyed each month an average of
400 stills and poured out a monthly
avernge of 27,000 of whisky."
The percentage of captures is small
against stills abandoned when the
chase gets too hot. Unless a moon
shiner is killed or caught and jailed
he's back on the job in a few days.
1500 Sharpshooters Fight Moonshiners
Tom Curtis, champion revenue raid
er of Georgia .estimates that in Daw
son county, Georgia, at least 12,000
gallons of whisky are produced every
month! Using this figure as a per
centage basis, as against the stills
actually found and destroyed in that
county, it is a safe estimate that at
least half a million gallons of moon
shine whisky are produced every
month in the United States.
Fifteen hundred men are now in
the revenue service. Every moon
shine raider is a sharpshooter. They
risk their lives daily. Death traps are '.
laid for them by mountaineers. They
are shot at from ambush and they
fight thrilling gun battles. It's all in
the day's work. They are paid $125
a month salary and $3.33 a day for
expenses.
They wouldn't find one-tenth as
many stills as they do if it were not;
for tips given hy law-abiding citizens
and vengeful feudists. Sheriffs and
deputies often aid revenue men in
raids. But revenue men say an alarm
ing number of sheriffs are actually
allies of the moonshiners.
Chief Mager from Washington di
rects the government forces in the
moonshine war through nine districts
with headquarters in Richmond, Va.,
Greensboro, N. C, Atlanta, Gaj, Hun
tington, W. Va., Nashville, Tenn.,
Louisville, Ky., Little Rock, Ark., New
Orleans, La., and San Antonio, Texas.
Eight States Form Chief Battldgraund
The worst moonshining district in
the United States is in the Blue
Ridge, Cumberland and Piedmont
mountains of the Appalachians,
stretching through parts of eight
states Kentucky, West Virginia, Ten
nessee, Alabama, Geogia and North
and South Carolina.
Draw a circle around that part of
the map touching these states and
you will have a good idea of the loca
tion af most of the illicit whisky dis
tilleries of the country.
Here are the mountaineer moon
shiners, believers in the "Divine
Right" of man to make whisky out
of corn the illiterate ''hillbillies,"
the most desperate men Uncle Sam's
revenue army is fighting.
In the cities the worst is yet to
come. The moonshining industry In
the cities is still in its infancy.' The

PHOENIX, June IS. That a man
who Bells a beverage .believing it to
be non-intoxicating, which it is not,
and is convicted for violating the li
quor law, must bear the punishment
for his own ignorance, was the con
tention raised today by Richard E.
Sloan, appearing in the $25,000 ac
tion brought by Ira E. Troutner
against Walter Hill and the Walter
Hill company.
The attorney for the defendant held
that an action for damages could not
be based on the plaintiff's own wrong
and that he could not collect dam
ages for the crime he himself com
mitted. Troutner instituted proceedings on
the ground that he contracted with
the defendant to sell cider, which he
said was represented to him as non
intoxicating liquor. Wholly relying
on this representation, Troutner as
serted, he purchased what he believ
ed to be cider and sold it. Later,
he said, it was proven to contain
six. per cent alcohol. Troutner was
prosecuted for Violation of the liquor
law and was sentenced to thirty days
in the county jail, with a $300 fine.
He 'alleges that his reputation was in
jured and sought to place responsi
bility on the wholesaler selling the
"cider
After the jury had been selected,
the defendant's attorney declared in
his opening statement that it was a
man's duty to know what he sold.
He contended that Troutner had no
relief from the effects of his own vi
olation f the law.
Judge Pattee, who is sitting in the
case in which Judge Stanford is dis
qualified, observed that it was ob
vious the defendant's point was well
taken, and stated that he would rule
on the matter tomorrow morning.

HENRY FORD'S "FLAG
OF HUMANITY" BOBS
UP IN LIBEL TRIAL
MOUNT CLEMENS, Mich., June 18.
A shadow of Henry Ford's "Flag of
Humanity" was unfurled In Judge
Tucker's court today in course of bear
of Mr. Ford's libel suit against the
Chicago Daily Tribune.
Evidence in the case has quoted
Mr. Ford as opposing flags of nations
as obsolete "something to rally

WASHINGTON RADICALS MAKE
"POLITICAL PRISONER" DEMAND
BELLING HAM, Wn June 18.
Radicals and conservatives in the an
nual meeting here of the Washington
State Federation of Labor spent a
day in acrimonious debate which at
times resulted in personal clashes
between the delegates.
The radicals, just before adjourn
ment, scored their first victory, when
the resolution demanding the release
of "political prisoners" was passed.
A few minutes previously the con
vention had adopted a resolution on
the same subject more temperate in
tone and approved by the resolutions
committee. Advocating adoption of
the radical resolution, one delegate
urged the others not only to vote
for it, but to show their sympathy
' by direct action on the job."

The Company
of the Future
Two wells to be started this week on
the Woods tract was the decision of the
Directors at their regular meeting yes
terday. Our representative is in California
selecting another string of tools, and
as soon as they are received we will
start drilling on the Walker tract. That
will mean three wells drilling.
The Perkins well is the greatest dis
covery since the McClesky well was
brought in, and to think our Woods
tractis only eight hundred yards away.
Which insures us equal production as
soon as we get our well down.
....Mr. Barkwell promises completion in
fifty, days from the time of starting.
This will give us production before the
Company is six months old, and practi
cally insure dividends by the end of the
year. This will be an unusual record
for a company of such magnitude as it
requires time to get large enterprises
started.
Our success will be due to the wise
judgment of those who planned, and
are responsible for the existence of this
sompany.
Do you realize what a 10,000-barrel

Valedictory
With regret at parting tempered by pleasure in welcoming him to
a broader field of individual enterprise, the Review this wee is bidding
farewell to Mr. H. D. Ross, Jr., its general manager since the first of the
present year, who leaves in a few days to take active charge of the
Mesa Daily Tribune, which Jie has purchased from George Allison, the
transfer of possession having already been made.
Mr. Ross, the son of Judge H. D. Ross, of Phoenix, is one of the
Snasjt widely known and capable newspapermen of the state. Practi
cally trained in every branch of journalism" from the ground up, his rise
in his chosen profession has been rapid during his career in the South
west, and though a young man, his ability has placed him invariably in
posts of importance and responsibility on the newspapers which he
served, both in Arizona and Texas.
Mr. Ross has filled editorships on both the Republican and the
Gazette in Phoenix, and also had a successful career in the newspaper
field in San Antonio, Texas.
Prior to his advent in the Warren District field, Mr. Ross, through
his initiative and originality, was a large factor In El Paso's journalistic
life during his occupancy of the post of city editor of the El Paso Morn
ing Times. He left the 'city desk" of that paper to become news editor
of the Review, in which capacity he served this paper last year under
a previous management. Recognition of his merits won him the post
of general manager, wjiich he has filled during the present year with a
capability and fidelity reflected in every department of this newspaper,
and with a reciprocal courtesy in dealing with the paper's clientele
which has won for the Review a host of warm friends throughout the
Whrren District.
The Review congratulates the Mesa Daily Tribune on its new pro
prietor, in a 'spirit of fraternal recognition of the fact that while the
Review's loss may be the Tribune's gain, the field of Arizona Journalism
at large i losing nothing by the transaction. And it is in this spirit'
that the Review wishes Mr. Ross "God speed" and a maximum of suc
cess in his advent upon the stage of newspaper ownership.
The Lad With a Diploma
The land is full of commencements these days, and the woods are
populated with harried citizens escaping the importunities of lads with
a diploma, and an eagerness to acquire any job where "ability, education
and marked qualifications will be appreciated."
One of the few occasions on which our personal chest expanded with
pride was when -we marched in cap and gown behind the college band
in our own comemncement procession. 1
And when wo had been given, with pomp arid ceremony, our near
parchment, inscribed with flowing script, in never-to-be-translated latin,
the only reason we didn't burst our clothes was because the gown was
ample having been rented for the occasion and being far from a fit,
if senior gowns ever do fit.
Then, when the tumult was over, and the flowers were all distri
buted, and the black gowns had scurired away never again to gather, we
went out the big iron gates into the world, and we felt our mightiness
and valor flowing out of us like maple sap in sugar time.
And a month later we were engaged in the scholastic pursuit of
chambermaiding the home town's livery nags, at a stipend of eighteen
dollars a month and board ourself.
The old time graduates who pursued, usually at a distance, through
three prep and four collegiate years, the twistings and trimmings of a
so-called clasical education, and who emerged into a busy world with a
somewhat hazy knowledge as to the number of parasangs Zenophan
inarched; and a few scattered ideas as to the distinction between
hedonism and the doctrines of the Epicurians; these lads certainly had ,
an elegant time of it before they made a living.
Modern education, that equips graduates to do some more definite
thing that the outside world is willing to pay to have done, has removed
a lot of graduate dish washers, and college waiters, and B. A. ash cart
pushers from among us.
But at the best, the June graduate is in for a tough time, a tumbling
of ideals, and a smashing of idols.
Bear with him gently .kind sir, we pray thee.
.Character More Important Than Clothes
Some very worldly-wise people accuse rejigious people of spending
a great deal of time with "derelicts" those w ho are supposed to be down
and out trying to change their hearts instead of improving their clothes.
They argue that when you give a. man better clothes to wear his
heart will naturally grow better.
Religious people pay a great deal of attention to relief work, furn
ishing food and clothes to those who need them and nobody is doing
more than the church in this respect but it has been clearly proven
that the "inside" of a man is of more vital importance than the "outside."
Clothes aren't nearly so important as character.
"Out of the heart are the issues of life." said the sage of Scripture.
"As a man thinketh In his heart so is he," he added.
When religious people give bo much attention to a man's "soul"
they are dealing with a fundamental thing.
If this can be settled right, the other always takes care of itself,
but the fact that a man wears a good coat doesn't necessarily mean he's
got a clean heart
Fixed Rooting Places
A little oak tree was getting alongvery well when it suddenly de
cided that it would move over into the next field, which it did.
Just about the time its roots were begining to take hold it told its
friends the sun was too hot out there and it moved on to a grove not
far distant.
The older trees overshadowed its beauty so much there that it moved
back to Its first neighborhood only to find that the trees who had stayed
in one place were big, healthy oaks while it still remained a dwindling
sapling.
Man, like a tree, grows best in a fixed rooting place, if he is the
right kind cf a man.
It is occasionally true that one has been unfortunate in selecting
his growing place, but even at that a degree of persistence and persever
ance will win out.
This consortium the nations have planned is an agreement to lend
to China collectively in order to keep one another from stealing from
China individually.

GLEASON STOREKEEPER
ACCUSED OF FRAUD
China should have postponed her anti-Japan? te boycott until the
league got ou the job to guarantee existing territorial integrity.
TUCSON. June 18. Barney Bono,
general storekeeper at Gleason ad
judged bankrupt on May 27. attended
a meeting of the creditors yesterday
in Tucson, at which E. L. McMakin,
of Steinfeld's, presided as referee,
and later was arrested on a federal
warrant charged with using the mails
to defraud, sworn, cut by T. H.
Blanchard, of the Tri-State Credit
assoication.
According to Mr. Blanchard, Bono
last March filed a statement of alleg
ed financiel standing which was
false. He sent it through the mail
to the association at El Paso.
At the meeting yesterday he told
of filing the statement, for the pur
pose of raising credit. Mr. Blanch
ard attended the meeting and subse
quently swore out the warrant.
The failure of Bono was due to the
shutting down of the camp, leaving
him with thousands of dollars worth
of uncollectible bills on his books, it
is said.
ROBBED ON FLORENCE ROAD

wife of New Mexico, were held up
on the Florence highway, near Hig

day morning at 4:25 o'clock. The
man and hi3 wife were camping when
two desperadoes, one a large man
and the other a short-built fellow,
covered them with six-shooters and
demanded their money. Berry sur
rendered $390 in currency and the
wife's handbag, containing several
dollars in silver was taken, together
with a silver mounted? pearl-handled
revolvel bearing Berry's name, a 30

shotgun. The revolver was a 45
calibre. After getting all the loot
they could find in the car, they forc

coolly drove the Ford away. After

UNFAIR LISTS PLANNED

PHOENIX. June 18. Wildcatting
in oil and other industrial stocks is
going to be somewhat more difficult
after the new plan of unfair listing
by the National Association of Se

fect A statement of this plan was
made yesterday by D. F. Johnson of
the corporation commission, who has
just returned from a trip east to at
tend the annual convention of that
organization.
The plan is designed to protect the
public from the manipulations of
jobbers in stocks of questionable
value by prrparing and ' miiltainiug
a list of those persons and companies
that have engaged in this pursuit and
the names of the companies they
have promoted, after they have been
proven to have participated in such

commission of the various states are
to .be interchanged through the na
tional association, and be on file at
the various offices ami Bubject to

Under such conditions as this it
will be one's own fault to get taken
in by a plausible salesman of doubt

he may have operated, his record
will be available if he has ever been
connected with wildcat propositions.

the property has been taken over by
a five-million-dollar close corporation,
with no stock for sale and operations
have been started, with tonnage being
extracted and piled up in huge slabs
of gray copper.
The enrichment extends over 30
claims. It is secondary throughout,
the oxidized ore having been eroded,
leaving the secondary ore practicJy
bare. The deepest working is an old
abandoned shaft, about 100 feet from
which a cross-cut was driven 200 feet,
away from the ore. Then the big diS'
covery was made to the south,-con
tiguous, end now has been opened in
a cut 30feet deep, 20 feet between
walls, and possibly more, with the ore
getting richer, as the mining of four
men with hand steel is continued.
The character of the ore and the
type of eruptive, is comparable ? with
the Silver Bell district, Mineral Hill
and Sasco, with the southern extreme
end at Douglas and a mine about
every 12 miles.
The claims are located 10 miles
down the Mission road, and a mile
to the we3t, in the midst of the Tuc
son buttes, adjoining the Saginaw,
where the Calumet and Arizona drill

The company formed by Mr. Kelso

MILLION DOLLAR
PHOENIX HOTEL
PHOEXIX. Juna 18. With the
bonds for its construction floated and
the financing completed, a million
dollar hotel is to be built in Phoenix,
assuring for this city the largest sin
gle improvement in its history and
providing a convenience needed at
the present time possibly above any
other.
The announcement of thi3 magnif
icant addition to Phoenix, which is
not a promotion but o cold blooded
fact, has been withheld until the last
arrangements effected by M. T. Grier,
Jordan, Grace & Phillinps, J. H.
Christian and S. J. Buckingham have
been made.
Mr. Crier, proprietor of the Castle
Hot Springs hotel, and S. E. Jordan
returned to Phoenix yesterday morn
ing and announced that the financing
of the new hotel had been completed
and that Us construction in this city
was certain.
The entire plan for the building of
this million dollar hotel in this city
was placed before the directors of
the chamber of commerce at a special
meeting yesterday and received their
unqualified endorsement.
This magnificent hotel is to have
the most central location in the city
and the most desirable in every way
the Central school block which was
purchased from the school board by
Babbitt Brothers.
A contract has been closed with
Babbitt Brothers for the purchase of
all except 74 feet of the east half of
this block of ground, the new hotel
to occupy 300 feet facing on Central
avenue and 179 feet on Monroe street.
Plans for a magnificent hotel
structure are now being prepared: by
Posten and Fisher, noted Chicago ho
tel architects and engineers. Prelim
inary plans that already have been
submitted and which will be incorpo
rated . in .the final plans call for a
building nine stories' in height, ex
clusive of basements '. and roof gar
den. The hotel will have 300 rooms,
each with bath, with ice water piped
to every room, and the structure . will
be modern andi of "the, very highest
class in every detail. " '
The ,i roof garden is J designed . to
solve.'one of the big problems K of
Phoenix v in . providing accommoda
tions for large conventions and otherj
big meetings for which at present
there is no ample auditorium. In
this garden on top of Phoenix's new
million dollar hotel, it is planned to
seat 1200 peopjle under one roof. A
portion of the roof garden will be a
glass-enclosed banquet hall where
400 or 500 persons may dine at one
time or where smaller conventions
can be accommodated.
At the head of the operating com
pany which is to manage Phoenix's
magnificent hotel is M. T. Grier, who
has made such a success of Castle
Hot Spring hotel.
Plans for the hotel are expected
form the Chicago architects within
60 days, it was announced last night
Work of razing the old Central
school v building on the ground will
begin at that time and construction
will follow immediately. Construc
tion of the hotel will require about
eight months, it was stated.

TURKEY THREATENS
GREATER MASSACRES
IF EMPIRE-S CUT UP
WASHINGTON, D. C, June 18.
The sick man of Europe is getting
well again!
Turkey i3 making its voice at the
peace table in Paris, and this is the
message its emissaries have brought:
The Moslem hordes will massacre
all the Christians in Asia Minor If
the allies impose a peace on Turkey
which cuts up the empire!
According to advices received in
government circles in Washington,
the sultan's government is making
the open threat in . Paris that the
Armenian massacres which shocked
the world in 1914, will be humane af
fairs compared to what will happen
in 1919.
"Kill every Christian dog!" will le
the cry of the sultan's brutes.
The Turks, according to the infor
mation available here, will not object
to any military or financial clauses
In the peace treaty. Their principal
objection is to granting freedom to
Armenia, and to the reported purpose
of the allies to eject the porte from
Constantinople, the "holy" otty which
has been the Mussulman capital for
centuries. ,
. Concessions might be granted per
mitting the allies to maintain a pro
tectorate over Palestine but that Is
as far as the Turks will go.
The most surprising thing is the
fact that the Turkish government has
used American missionaries as its
tools in laying this message before
the peace conference.
The sultan's agents . have made
pleasant promises to the missionaries
that they will be good if Turkey is
left intact, that some sort of automo
ny under Turkish suzerainty will be
granted to Armenia, and that Chris
tians wil lbe permitted complete free
dom of worship In future.
It's a form of propaganda taught
the Turks by their German masters.
The American missionaries who
have always been well treated, even
patronized by the Turks, particularly
in Constantinople are said to have

The "Big Four" has already com

BY REVIEW
STOCKS AND BONDS
NEW YORK, June 18 Easier
money rates again contributed meas
urably to further strength of the
stock market today, price movements
at the outset assuming almost buoy
ant proportions. Many favorite is
sues scored early advances of two to
almost six points. These were ma
terially shaded by heavy selling for
profits before the end of the first
hour, but a fresh upturn occurred.
Call money dpened at 8 per cent for
mixed collateral, but receded to 5 1-2
per cent at mid-day. Time funds
ruled firm on small supply except for
shorter maturities.
Speculative interests paid Bcant at
tention to foreign developments.
This was reflected in the tone of
shares most concerned, United States
Steel, for example, making an ex
treme gain of 1 13 to 107 3-4.
Other steels and kindred equip
ments were consistently strong at
gains of 2 to 7 points. The bulk of
the trading again revolved around
motors and their specialties, oils, to
Baccos, leathers and shippings at
gross advances of 2 to 13 points. Rails
followed their recent isolatedycourse.
Sales amounted to 1,425,000 shares.
Industrial and utility issues were
among the stronger features of the
bond market. Liberty bonds were
steady and the foreign group was
firmer.' Total sales, par value, ag
gregated $9,750,000.
Old United States bonds were un
changed on . call.
THE GRAIN MARKETS
CHICAGO, June 18. Estimates
that the planted corn land in the
eight largest states had been reduced
in extent this year about 8,000,000
acres made all deliveries of corn jump
today to the highest prices yet thlSj
season. The market closed strong at
2 7-8 to 4 1-4 cents net. gain, with
July $1.79 1-2 to $1.79 3-4 and Sep-,
tember $1.72 3-4 to 1.73. Oats fin-
ished 1 3-8 to 1 7-8c up. In provis-i
ions the outcome ranged from 65c I
decline to a rise of 2 l-2c.
Bullish sentiment ruled the corn 1
market as soon as traders understood
that the current estimates meant
planted acreage this year would be
the smallest since 1909. Ideal weath
er had at first led to a drop in values
but thi3 influence was. almost imme-i
diately forgotten. Assertions on the
part of bear leaders were also in vain
that pending the government report
July 1 the 8,000,000 acre reduction es-,
timate, equal to the entire acreage of
Iowa, was too daring to be trusted.'
Despite considerable profit taking,
tho reactions from the top prices of
the day were relatively slight.
Fear of crop damage gave some in
dependent strength to oils. As in
corn, trade was on a large scale. .
Provisions were weak owing to
sharp declines in the value of hogs.
Besides, foreign news concerning lard
was bearish. '
THE METAL MARKET
NEW YORK June 18. Lead un

DARING CLIMAX IN
"A THICK OF FATE"
AT EAGLE TODAY
BESSIE BARRISCALE STAGES
HIGHLY EMOTIONAL AND SEN
SATIONAL SCENES IN HER
LATEST PICTURE DRAMA
There is an original and daring cli
max to "A Trick of Fate" in which
Bessie Barriscale is featured at the
Eagle theater today.
The scene is the "Cafe of the Black
Rat," a rendezvous of the Apaches of
Paris.
Time: An hour after midnight.
Two drunken cab-drivers have just
been put out by the proprietor, and
the place is deserted save for one
lone figure seated at a table in a dark
corner drinking absinthe.
A squarejawed man enters, says a
word to the proprietor and sits at
table near the center. The face of
the absinthe drinker is haggard, his
eyes sullenly wild, and he is evidently
In a condition of semi-madness
caused by the "wormwood.'
The man is a murderer. He killed
the girl known as Anna Gerard, who
had been an entertainer in the "Black
Rat,' 'and was his "woman."
Suddenly he arises to his feet, hor
ror In his face. Is that the strains
of "La Giralda" a wild Andalusian
air the girl used to sing? Is he dream
ing? Then out onto tho stage steps the
girl herself or so he thinks and she
begins to sing the refrain in a sensu
ous cadence.
Coming down, she approaches the
Apache murderer. Is this- hallucina
tion a phantasy of his diseased
brain?- Yes, he must be going road.
Nearer and nearer comes the girl.:
With a wild shriek he crouches back
into the corner.
"You You! Anna! It cannot be you
for I killed you!"
The square-jawed man raises his
hand, two gendarmes enter and lead
Pierre LaRouge away had-cuffed.
What was the mystery? It was "A
Trick of Fate," and the solution Is
found in the play in which Bessie
Barriscale plays a double role. It is

The divorce case of Aurelia B.
Sparks vs. J. M. Sparks of Douglas,
one of the members of the board of

again come to life according to the
following story that has been sent
out from Phoenix:
"Bringing charges of collusion be

a divorce action, attorneys for Anrel

plaintiff to set aside the satistactioa
of judgment.
"J. T. Kingsbury, O. Gibson and
Homer C. Millsap, i the attorneys
for the plaintiff filed the record of
the case in the supreme court. Their
