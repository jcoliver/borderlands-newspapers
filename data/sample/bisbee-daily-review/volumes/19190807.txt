Catero Says He Has Been On
An Investigation of His Own
On "Deporters"; Monotony
Marks Rest of the Testimony
(Special to The Review)
DOUGLAS. Arl2., Aug. 6. Prelim
Inary hearings of John Rainey, James
Glasson and Prank Salmons, of Bis
bee, defendants in the deportation
cases, were completed In Justice W,
C. Jack's court during a long session
that would have been tedious had it
not been for the appearance of one
bright star during the day: Dominick
Catero, one of the state's witnesses.
Catero, who had previously stated in
court that he could testify against
"any of 'em." was given the chanoe
today to tell some of the Information
which he claims to be gathering
daily against defendants in the cases.
The hearing of Rainey was- -com
pleted In few minutes daring thei
morning session. J. r. tioiman ana
Richard Denning were the state's
witnesses. Both testified to having
seen Rainey, armed, standing with a
crowd of other armed citizens at the
Warren baseball park on the day of
the deportations. It was the belief
of the witnesses that Rainey was
guarding the deportees. This testi
mony, both witnesses admitted dur
ing cross-examination, was the extent
of their knowledge of the activities
of Rainey on the day of the deporta
tions. Salmons Was Taking a Ride
Mrs. Rosa McKay, member of the
state .legislature from Gila county,
was the first witness called to the
stand during the hearing of Salmons.
Mrs. McKay said that on the morn
ing of the day of the deportations
she and her sister-in-law had walked
down Naco road to see If they could
find a relative whom the witness re
ferred to as "Al." Meeting Salmons
riding down the road on horseback,
said Mrs. McKay, her sister-in-law
said to the defendant: "What have
you done with Al, you dirty cur?"
Salmons replied, said Mrs. McKay,
that he did not know where "Al" was:
presumed he had been taken to the
ball park.' Mrs. McKay said she had
aot seen Salmons again that day and
questioning brought out that this
was the extent of her knowledge of
any participation that Salmons might
have taken during the deportatioas.
J. P. Holman told of having seen
Salmons, mounted on horseback and
armed, riding beside the line . of de
portees and guards on the Eakervllle
Warren road. lie had sot seen the
defendant arrest any one or speak to
any of the deportees during the day,
said Holman. The state rested In the
Salmons case without ,further testi
mony and the defense offered ao wit

Railroad Unions Act as Unit
For First Time in History
In Presenting Demand For
Congress Fund to Raise Pay
WASHINGTON, Aug. 6. Acting as
a unit for the first time in the pres
entation of wage demands, the four
teen principal railroads unions today,
expressing to Director General Hines
their disapproval of President Wil
son's proposal that congress create
a commission to consider increased
pay, declared that wage questions
must be settled immediately.
A program to meet the present
crisis, involving the threat of a nation-wide
strike, fks submitted to
the director general. It suggested
that the money to provide increased
pay should come from an appropria
tion by congress, to be followed by
appropriate freight rate advances.
This "temporary relief" must be
accompanied by a determined effort
to reduce the cost of living, said the
demands. Permanent solution of the
railroad problem was declared to de
pend on the removal of returns to
capital as the sole purpose of opera
tion and the director general, ac
cordingly, was asked to recommend
to President Wilson that he attempt
to obtain early passage by congress
of organized labors bill to eliminate
private capital from control of the
railroads and to give the employes a
share in the profits. The unions de
clared the belief of the workers than
transportation rates should be suffi
cient to guarantee just wages, main.
tain the properties and give equitable
returns on money invested.
Interesting as were the suggestions
for removing the alleged menace of
a nation-wide strike, the unified ac

J
So Says Secretary Lansing
In Treaty Hearing Before
Senate Comjnittee; Thinks
Kaiser Can'tf Be Prosecuted
WASHINGTON, Aug. 6 Secretary
Lansing, before the senate foreign
relations committee today, expressed
the opinion that the Shantung provi
sion or the pece treaty did not
square with President Wilson's enun
ciated principle of, self-determination,
but maintained that the treaty as a
whole carried out "substantially" the
president's fourteen points.
. Declaring his unfamilarity with
many details of the peace negotia
tions and of the treaty itself, the sec
retary told the committee he was un
able to answer many of its questions
and reminded senators in answering
others that he merely was expressing
his own personal views.
"Ask the President"
"Ask th president," the secretary
said when pressed for details of the
Shantung and league of nations nego
tiations. On three of the points
raised he asked permission to refresh
his memory and make a statement to
the committee later and when he
was asked for a detailed explanation
of labor and reparations clauses he
protested that he could not be ex
pected to carry the minutiae of an
80,000 word document in his mind and
reminded the- committee that it was
much easier to ask questions "pre
pared before hand" than to answer
them off hand.
Says Kaiser Can't Be Tried
Mr. Lansing said that in his opin
ion Japan probably would have signed
the treaty without the Shantung pro
visions; that the United States should
ask no part of Gthiany reparations;
that the kaiser could not be legally
tried, and that the mutual guarantee
of territorial integrity from external
aggression, as contained in article
ten of the league covenant, imposed
a moral obligation but not a legal
one.
Points Not Discussed in Paris
The secretary said it was true that
the fourteen points had not been dis
cussed to his knowledge, in the pre
paratory stages or the peace negotia
tions; that the American draft of the
league of nations never was "pressed"
before the conference; that the presi
dent had asked the peace conference
not to lay before the French senate
the record of discussion on the
league; and that the United States
did not know of secret treaties be
tween the Allies and Japan, regard
ing Shantung when this country, by
the Lansing-Ishti agreement, recog
nized Japan's privileges in China. It
was not true, Secretary Lansing said,
that he and other members of
the American delegation "protested"
against the Shantung settlement,
that Great Britain refused to permit
"discussions" of the freedom of the
seas, by the peace conference, or
that any of the American expert ad
visors had resigned because they dis
agreed with the decision regarding
Shantung.
The general basis on which the
treaty was framed, said the secretary,
was "common sense and general
principles with an avoidance of pol
icy and expediency."
Verbal records of the discussion, he
told the committee, had been left in
Paris, adding that he would not favor
giving to the senate the less com
plete transcripts in the possession of

IS CLEARED UP
President In Statement, Sees
Difficulties All Removed By
Jap Promise to Keep Only
Economic Rights In China
WASHINGTON, Aug. 6. President
Wilson issued a formal statement to
night saying that the 'frank state
ment" made by Viscount Uchida as "to
Japan's policy regarding Shantung,
"ought to serve to revive many of the
misunderstanding regarding Shantung
which had begun to accumulate about
this question."
Refereneo in the Uchida statement
as to the agreement between Japan
and China in 1915. "might be mislead
ing," the president said, "if not com
mented upon, In the light of what oc
curred In Paris."
"When the question of disposal of
Shantung was definitely decided on at
Paris," President Wilson said, "the
Japanese delegation in reply to a
question from him said:
The policy of Japan is to hand
back the Shantung peninsula In full
sovereignty to China, retaining only
the economic privileges granted to
Germany and the right to establish a
settlement under the usual conditions
at Tslng-Tao."
President's Statement
The president's statement, made
public through the etate department,
follows :
"The government of the United
States has noted with the greatest in

Viscount Uchida with regard to Ja

The statement ought to serve to re

There was no intimation from the
White House as to the nature of rec
ommendations the president would
make in addressing congress. From
the trend of the government activities
in an attempt to solve the living cost
problem, however, in the view of the
severa officers, the president would
deal with these subjects:

of the Lever food control
law, to make it operative after the

Legislation limiting the margin
of profit on necessities.
Another major development of the
day was the making public of the fed

shoe industry investigation. This re
port charged that the high price of
shoes resulted from excessive profits
taken by every factor in the trade.

vision. "Not entlrel," aaid Mr. Lansing.
"Was the Shuntang decision made
in order to have Japan's signature to
the elague of nations?"
"I really haven't the facts about
about that"
"Would Japan's signature to the
league have been obtained without
the Shantung decision?" .
"I think so"
Lost China's Signature
Senator Jchnson suggested that had
the Shantung clause not been adopted
the treaty, and th? leag'W covenant
would have another signature.
"We would have had China's," Mr.
Lansing agreed.
"So the result was Bimply to lose
China?" suKgested Senator Johnson.- -
"That 1 iriy personal view," the "sec
retary answered, adding that the Shaa
tung provisions was' accepted by direc
tion of President Wilson. ' , '
"The decision was his then and not
yours?"
"Necessarily." - '
Senator Johnson asked If Secretary
Lansing had heard officially any rea
son for the Shantung- agreement. -
Mr. Lansing replied negatively, add
ing that he Lad never discussed, the
matter with Colonel House. Question
ed in detail. Secretary lAnsiug reaf
firmed his statement that the 14 points
were "substantially" carried out.
Regarding the first point, dealing
with "open covenants openly arrived
at," he said: -
"I consider that was, carried out. Of
course uo negotiations can go on be
tween nations that are done at a pub
lic bearing." .
Freedom of the seas, the second
point, the secretary said, did not en
ter into the negotiations.
Denies Britain, Put en Lid
"Isn't it a fa-t that England would
n.ot let it be considered?" atked Sena
tor Johnson.
"No, it never came up."

third point The fourth, for reductions

ed by the )a&i2e covenant '
"But there, is no arrangement for
reduction tbre except at the option of
nations," protested Senator Johnson.
"The covenant imposes a moral- ob
ligation," the secretary replied. "That
is quite true of the entire covenant
Every nation ultimately has a vote.
There is no more modification of sov

Packers Deny Profiteering
Testifying before a senate commit
tee investigating conditions in the
District of Columbia. Thomas E. Wil-'
son, president of Wilson & Co., and
chairman of the Institute of American
Meat Packers, declared that the pack
ers were not profiteering. The high
cost of living, he told the committee,
was a world problem and not local.
"The world is on a holiday and peo
ple are spending money like drunken
sailors, without producing," he added.
Later upon learning the decision of
the department of justice, Mr. Wilson
made this statement: "The facts
shown by the federal trade commis
sion do not justify a suit by the gov
ernment The department of justice
is looking around for somebody to
blame and naturally they intend to
make the packers the mark. I don't
think the suits the way to go about it.
The department of justice will get no
satisfaction out of the packers and
will do no good in reducing prices."

of the stage and mounted the witness
stand in a manner that would have
befitted a king mounting his throne.
The county attorney . started to ques
tion him as to. his. name, occupation
and length ot residence in Arizona,
but Dominick needed no questioning.
He was off in a flash, at the start and
in a few minutes the spectators were
gripped with the story of bis early
life and personal adventures in the
Warren district. Occasionally the
witness was interrupted by the
county attorney with question, but
most of the time during direct exam
ination Dominick was his own master
of ceremonies.
Springs Own List of De porters"
It was during cross-examination
that Dominick scored his big success,
however. In the half dozen previous
hearings in which he has appeared as
a witness for the state Dominick had
mentioned with glee that he had a
"little red book" in which he had the
dope on "all of 'em." Yesterday he
again pulled the little book from hrs
pocket, waved it at the defense and
announced in the tone of a judge pro
nouncing a death' sentence that the
information contained " in the pamph
let was of a startling natuie, and that
he had lists of names of men, whom
ne said took part in the deportations,
that no one but himself knew of. He
was bo enthusiastic over the contents
of the book that counsel for the de
fense requested him to make known
some of the lists which it held. Dour
inick was nonpulsed for several mo
ments. He wasn't ready yet to make
his lists public, he said, but there was
no help, and so he slipped a rubber
band from the book, carefully folded
back the pages and proceeded to read
off a list of the names of 46 men
whom he said be had seen taking part
in the, deportations. .
Dominick was not content to mere
ly read this list, . however, for with
the reading of almost every name he
added a brief account of his personal
experiences and troubles with each
man. Dominick called attention to
many of the names by announcing
that their owners had never been ar
rested yet. With the names of other
men he recited at length the circum
stances under which he had met them.
Dominick Admits He's Good
Dominick said he had started keep
ing hia little book as soon as he had
heard that action was contemplated
against those alleged to have taken
part in the deportation. His lists in
creased every day, he said, whenever
he thought of new names to add to it.
And he promised that other names
were yet to be added. It was a great
afternoon for M. Catero, but he was
obviously -disappointed at the good
natured manner in which counsel, for
the defendants listened to his test!
mony. When he was excused from
further cross-examination Dominick
was ever more disappointed. He mod
cstly admitted his importance as a
witness on leaving the stand, how
ever, when ho grinned joyfully at the
attorneys for the defense and said.
"Me, I'm too much for you fellows
an' you know, it."
Says Glasson Had Rifle
Dominick's direct testimony against
Glasson was that he had seen the de
fendant on the day of the deporta
tions standing in the ball park with
a ''big rifle." Dominick, himself,- was
not among the 1100 men deported.
Two other witnesses were called
against Glasson by the state. Free
mau Crouch, who testified that Glas
sou had grabbed him by the arm and
placed him in "the ring" in front of
the Bisbee postoffice on the morning
of July 12. 1917, and, George Haigler
who corroborated this testimony.

Was in a narrow box ranvnn nnaMn

at once and the sheriffs tig car,
driven by Cleve Irby, a prisoner, was
sent over tne roadless rocks and

"So one but Irby. a skilled driver,

"Irby, who is up for bootlegging, has

Review.
In Ihe month of October, last, the
Review published a certain article
concerning Mr, L. B. Whitney, form
erly city attorney of Bisbee. The arti
cle published was inadvertently
copied by the Review from the Verde
Copper NVws, as a matter of news,
and contained what purported to be
a resolution alloged to have been
passed by the Northern Arizona Bar
association. We are advised that the
resolution, contained in the published
article, was construed by many of our
readers as charging Mr. Whitney with
being a prominent legal light for the
I. W. W. organization and with bring
ing groundless, scandalous and unwar
ranted law suits and with desecrating
the courts of justice by acting as at
torney, and bringing certain civil ac
tions against -the United Verde Cop
per company and others.
Mr. Whitney, resenting the publica
tion of the original article, immediate
ly filed suit against the Journal-Miner
of Prescott and the Bar association
for libel, asking damages in the sum
of $100,000, to vindicate his good
name, and has of late demanded a re
traction from the Review on account
of its republication of the article.
Mr. Whitney during his six years
residence in Bisbee, always conducted
himself as a gentleman and during
the time he practised law here and
was city " attorney, his acts, reputa
tion and character, as a citizen, at
torney and public official, were be
yond cavil and reproach.
To him, even, the term I. W. W. Is
anathema. Our knowledge of Mr.
Whitney's activities wholly negatives
the aforesaid charges against him and
the Review, with the knowledge it
has at hand, therefore, retracts the
matters "and things attributed to Mr.
Whitney by the above mentioned con
structions of the published artiste.
That he was appointed assistant at
torney general after. the article was
first published adds proof to his
standing in the community in which
h9 resides.
We advised Mr. Whitney by letter
that it Is not the policy of the Re
view to libel or injure anyone and we
regret .that the Verde Copper News
article inadvertently crept Into our
news columns, hence the Review
takes this method of vindicating Mr.
Whitney's good name.

will see the motion picture concerns
in an effort to have them resume the

which has been supplying these films
stopped doing so on the ground that
no admission was being charged.
I Mr. Putnam has letters showing
that the film concern had known this
fact ever since the "Y" has been
using the films, and says he believes
the movie company cut off the local
supply because of objections raised
by certain local theaters. Mr. Put

highly popular.
Secretary Putnam reported a high

MEET LQUGHREY
HEBEE0ST22
At a meeting of the Warren Dis

noon, arrangements were made for
the fight at the Warren ball grounds
Aug. 22 between Frank Loughrey ol
Philadelphia and Russell Chambers,
the fast armv fighter fram Douglas.
This "scrap" is expected to draw one
of the largest crowds that ever at
tended a mill in this section.
Loughrey has a remarkable record,
being known as the "Philadelphia
Bearcat," and has stayed through
gruelling fights with such ring artists
as the late Les Darcey, Mickey King
and Georges Carpentier. All who
have seen Chambers in action are
anxiouB to see him meet a worthy foe

NOT NECESSARY TO LOSE THE PRESENT TO GAIN
THE FUTURE.
"W:
HAT SHALL, it profit a man if he gain tne wnoie
k-orld and lose his own soul?"
Here are the stakes: "The world" of sense, or
honor, of wealth: "the soul" the man himself, his
inner life, the image of God in his heart, the divinity that makes him
immortal.
And here are the two destinies ahead: "The outer darkness
where there is weeping and gnashing of teeth," and an "inheritance
incorruptible and undefiled and that fadeth not away, which is laid
up for us in heaven."
L'efore we make our decision let's keep in mind some rather im
portant facts; the man who loses his soul loses the future, but he
does not necessarily gain the present. The nlan whose soul is saved
does not necessarily lose the present to gain the future.
It is entirely possible for a man to gain all of the future and
still retain the best things in the present. It does not follow that
everything in the present is bad. and that one must make a choice
between either the present or the future. The real question we are
called Upon to decide is whether, in order to gain the present we
are willing to give up the future and run the chance of losing both.
Unfortunately, most men believe that religion is a solemn, seri
ous, sour affair, with no joy in it. They could not be more thor
oughly mistaken.
It does mean that a man must be honest and fair and true to his
best ideals, but any other kind of a life doesn't bring very much
happiness even in this world.
You never saw a man who was crooked and unfair and untrue to
the finest things in life who was sincerely happy and joyous he was
constantly suffering tortures because of the fear of discovery and
because he might at any moment lose his ill-gotten wealth or position.
And so take your choice; do you want to live in the present
world with the full enjoyment of what actually makes life worth
while, with the certainty of a glorious future or, do you want to
live an uncertain, unhappy, fruitless life in the present because
you've surrendered the best that the world can give, with the cer
tainty of defeat and disappointment throughout all eternity?
"What shall it profit a man if he gain the whole world world
and lose his own soul?"

THE "Y" AND ITS MONEY.
N A REPORT covering its activities from April, 1917, to March
1919, national headquarters of the Y. M. C. A. accounts for
$97,815,000 of expenditures. The report shows that only slight
ly more than two per cent of the sum was spent for religious
purposes and that the remainder went for entertainment, huts, ath
letic supplies and the many other items which were included in the
budget.
While this seemingly small amount devoted to religious exten
sion may be regretted by those who regard the "Y's" work as essen
tial missionary, it is a complete answer to the charge that the huge
sums given by the public have been used in spreading the propaganda
of religious cults.
It will not surprise those who know that the "Y" lost money on
Its canteens which General Pershing asked the organization to con
duct. This loss aggregated 51,478,084, but in the light of the deprecia
tion of foreign exchange represented an actual book loss of $2,432,000.
Some of the items show the tremendous work done by the "Y"
In home and overseas camps: $1,166,767 for 97,000 concerts in home
camps attended by 43,500,000; $2,323,271 fcr "movies" in American
camps; huts on this side 950 of them $7,698,984.
Overseas there were 1900 or more huts, costing $4,801,000. equip
ped at a cost of $2,950,000 and maintained for $1,014,000. Overseas
men received 400,000,000 sheets of writing paper and 16,000,000 post
cards at a cost to the "Y" of $12,296,00.
And so the items pile up, each one of them a credit to the or
ganization and a tribute to the contributors to the fund. It is a very
gratifyign report all through, one to please and satisfy not only the
members of the "Y" everywhere, but to all who appreciate its work.
A MAN FIRST OF ALL
LIEUTENANT Commander A. C. Read was selected by tho
Navy Department to fly across the ocean and he succeeded
tho first man to successfully make the trip.
His father was a Baptist minister. His clean-cut face
and clean-cut language marks him as a man of nerve.
And, by the way, he is the type of man who has done things in
the war and who is working out cur perplexing reconstruction prob
lems. Blusterers and buffons can't get away with it these days. The
times are too serious and demand too much of our leaders.
For the man who has a broad outlook upon life and who can
see and feel the needs of the people, there never was a better chance.
But for cheap, sneering, profane men well, they'll have a hard
time to prove their sincerity of purpose and their ability to measure
up to the requirements. m
Read reaped the fruit of many martyrs' efforts in the aviation
field. They had all done their share in preparing the way for this
daring flight. Read had many qualities and achievements to his
credit, but he way selected chiefly because he was a real man.
Whatever else the world demands of him who is selected for
the place of honor, it always insists that he shall be a man.
At the confention of the newly-organized Federation of Profes
sional Business Women's Clubs in St. Louis, Miss Hannah Quinby,
a lawyer of Columbus, Ohio, urged the restoration by legislative
enactment of the whipping-post for. the punishment of wife-beaters.
Her proposal is said to have been due to recent Incidents in Colum
buB, in which abusive and vicious husbands had been shown too much
mercy.
In this country, ,at least, wifebeaters are not so numerous as to
be able to offer strong opposition to any legislation such as that pro
posed; and It is Improbable that any sentimental objection would be
developed among men not given to wife-beating.
Seven days more for Austria to decide whether to say "yes"
"no." Great waste of time, isn't it?

DOUGLAS, Ariz., Aug. 6. There
was an increase in the copper oulput
at the Copper Queen smelter in this
city during July of more than one
million pounds over that of the month
of June. The July output being 8,
400,000 pounds as compared with 7,
200.000 pounds in June. These totals
include all ores coming from Nacozarl
and from other custom sources. It
is expected that the output for Aug
ust will be still further increased at
the Queen smelter, estimate for the
present month now being nine million
pounds.
At the C. & A. smelter the total
output for July was 4.854.040 pounds.
At the C. & A. three reverberatory
furnaces are now in operation, both
blast furnaces remaining cold through
the past month.
At the Queen smelter four of the
largest blast furnaces are in opera-1
tion and one reverberatory.
In the Warren district everything
connected with the new 4000-ton
concentrator being constructed for
treating the ores of Sacramento hill.
Much of the material for this new mill
has been received, the excavations
for the foundations is complete and
orders for the steel are now being
made up.
Plans are also being made for some
overhauling of the big concentrator
at Nacozari by the Moctezuma Cop

ing and tests are now being made at
the Copper Queen plant here which
may result in some changes in the

NOGALES IS EXCITED
OVER WOMAN BURGLAR.
NOGALES, Aug. 6. A woman
burglar is at work in Nogales. This
fact became known this morning
when the footsteps of a woman and
the mark of her shoe on the side of
a building where she climbed in a
window were traced by employes ot
the Nogales Electric Light and Pow
er company, whose . clothes had been
rifled in the change room of the
plant last night.
Allen Hale, night engineer at the
light plant, noticed that four silver
dollars were missing from his trous
ers pocket when he changed from his
working to street clothes this morn
ing and began an investigation.
With the chief engineer he found
foot-prints of a woman leading up to
a window in the locker room at the
rear of the plant and the imprint of
her shoe where she had placed her
foot against the side of the building
to enable her to enter the room.
Burglars pried open the iron bars
over the rear door of Peterson's gro
cery store some time Saturday night
and made away with a considerable
quantity of merchandise.
This is about the 'steenth time this
grocery store has been burglarized
by thieves, who seem to delight in
making the store their special prey.
No clue has been obtained which
would lead to the apprehension of
the robers.

HIGH WATER AT TUCSON
SWEEPS BRIDGE AWAY.
TUCSON, Aug. 6. The inner piling
of the St. Mary's bridge has been
swept away by the recent flood
waters, with the result that there is
a big heap of brush and debris block
ing . the flow of water under the
bridge. County Engineer Foster an
nounced Monday. A gang of men are
at work clearing the bridge and will
replace the lost piling.
Urgent demands from all over the
county have arrived at the office of
the county engineer with the result
that there has been a change in sched
ule. All of the maintenance fund
will have to be spent, ho declared
Monday, on reconstruction expense
in order to let the traffic blockade at
various points through.
The Nogales road is gone, the wing
wall of the Continental bridge has
been torn away and the big ditch the
Continental Rubber company put in

Simultaneously with the breaking
out of the disease, sanitary condi
tions were improved, and Miss Rider
reports that now the camp is in first
class shape, and that there have been
no new cases for six weeks. Thirty
two persons contracted the fever, and
there were several deaths.
Miss Rider left Tucson agaf(i last
night for Prescott where she will
cooperate with the city health of
ficer. Dr. II. T. Southworth, in estab

city. Miss Rider will probably re

In Nogales, the many friends ot
Attorney S. F. Noon are urging him

that the railroad from the south was

WASHINGTON. Aug. 6. Organized
labor's remedy for the high cost of
living in a bill that would turn over
the railroads to the public, operating
officials, and labor was presented to
congress today by men high in the
council of the organization who de
clared with utmost frankness condi
tions were so desperate it might be
necessary to advocate "a firing squad
for profiteers."
With equal frankness members of
(he house interstate commerce com
mittee stated, during the examination
of Warren S. Stone, grand chief of
the Brotherhood of Railroad Locomo
tive Engineers, and Frank Morris,
secretary of the American Federation
or Labor, that the bill embodying
what has come to be called the Plumb
plan, was too radical, and failed to
strike at the high price evil against
which people throughout the country
are clamering. . '
For months the house committee
had been considering all plans for so
lution of the problems confronting the
roads with their return to private
management, and the Plumb proposal
was offered with the assurance of la
bor leaders that it would cut down
prices of commodities because of the
reduction in rates which would follow
the elimination of private capital from
the railroad companies.
The two union officials for five
hours stood up in defense of the bill
and answered a whirlwind fire of
questions from men who must report
it out or throw it away.
During the long discussion, attend
ed by an aTtentive audience including
maiy women, the labor leaders made
strong denial of reports that they
were attempting to intimidate con
gress by threats to strik or chop off
the political heads of members voting
contrary to their desires.
There was a broad intimation that
the public ownership plan if not en
acted into law would be taken to the
convention of the two big parties next
year, with the hope of having its en
dorsement written into the platrorm.
Warning was sounded by Secretary
Morrison, that the burden of the lead
ers might be too heavy that they
might be unable during their period
of unrest to control the workers in
which case, he declared there would
be a revolution to the next general
strike, around the whole theme of
which the two witnesses said was wav
en the ever-rising cost of food, mount
ing higher and faster, they insisted,
than the increase in the working
man's wage, with no assurance that
it would Stop unless quick and drastic
action was taken by congress.
Both Mr. Stone and Mr, Morrison
said wage increases offered 6nly tem
porary relief, contending that prices
of food and clothing must come down.
after which the wage demand pres
sure would be lessened.
They declared the pending bill
would prove to be the first step to
ward the forcing down process by re
ducing freight rates and expressed
tho belief that despite the burden
of bond" buying during the war the
American people would produce the
funds necessary to take the roads
from private control.
While the committee listened by
the hour to opinions as to what the
bill would do, there was no explana
tion of its various provisions. Glenn
E. Plumb, its author, was present to
give this but so much time was taken
up with tho examination of Stone and
Morrison that his statement had to
go over until tomorrow.

STOCKS AND BONDS
NEW YORK. Aug. 6. The many
substantial gains made by today's less
active stock market were construed
as an outward expression of the more
cheerful mood of the speculators.
Opinions respecting the gravity of
the railroad situation were consider
ably modified as the result of a state
ment attributed to one of the labor
leaders that the prospects of a gen
eral strike are remote.
Greater ease of money, call loans
falling to three per cent after opening
at 6 to 6Vfc and increased activity at
the steel mills, included the other en
couraging developments. Further de
moralization in the foreign exchange
market with francs at a new low rec
ord, was almost the sole disquieting
fluctuation.
In numerous instances from one-half
to two-thirds of the losses sustained
in the early days of the week were
regained, while several . active issues,
notably U. S. Rubber, United Retail
stores, Lorillard tobacco and Crucible
Steel were over last week's final
prices. '
Gross advances among rails ranged
1 to 4 points, but in the various in
dustrials and specialties, also ship
pings and food isues, gains ran from
3 to 15 points. Sales, 1,135,000 shares.
Bonds, including Liberty issues,
were irregular, the foreign group
showing no definite trend. Totals
sales, par value, $9,750,000. Old U. S.
bonds, unchanged.

THE GRAIN MARKETS
CHICAGO, Aug. 6. Frantic buying
of grain and provisions today resulted
from the decision reached last night
at Washington that the government
would not be justified in selling the
billion bushel 1919 wheat crop of the
United States at a loss of 50 to 75c
a bushel.
Closing quotations were strong, with
corn up 7 to 9c a bushel. September
1.80 to 1.82 and December at 1.51 to
$1.51. Oats gained 3c to 4c net
and provisions 47c to 1.90.
Inasmuch as a majority of corn trad
ers had sold light and left yesterday
on a generally accepted belief that the
government would throw on the fed
eral treasury the burden of the pro
posed deliberate loss on wheat, the
consequence today o fa directly oppo
site course on the part of the govern
ment was a wild stampede to the buy
ing side of the market. It was not un
til prices had risen in some cases as
much as 10c thai the advance of corn
was checked. Oats jumped in sympa
thy with corn. There was some buying
for export
Provisions responded to the same
factors w'aich hoisted grain. A fea
ture in the provisions market was
evidence of foreign buying of lard.

BRIDGE LOSS
PREVENTABL
Wash Out of $30,000 Bridge
Could Have Been Prevented
By Expenditure $300 Says
County Engineer J.C. Ryan
J. C. Ryan, engineer for the county
road commission, returned yesterday
from the Dourlas district and also
from a trip to the new $30,000 bridge
nef.r Benson which was washed out
Sunday by the San Pedro flood. Mr.
Ryan, who constructed the bridge
while h? was county engineer, said
the bridge was a total loss and reiter
ated his charge that an expenditure
of S300 in taking the necessary pre
cautions when the flood was threaten
ed would have saved the structure.
Mr. Ryan said no temporary bridge
had been started and that farmers on
the other side of the bridge who dis
pose of their produce in Bisbee and
the Warren district are facing heavy
losses. One man named Cosby, had
300 tons of watermelons ready to haul
which he fears will now be a total
loss. -.
Rapid progress is being made on
paving the Douglas-Bisbee road, Mr.
Ryan said. About four and a half
miles are now paved and the contrac
tor believes he can finish the work
by October 1, although Mr. Ryan re
gards this date as a little early. Work
will be resumed on the Lowell end
Monday and pushed throtigh to com
pletion. On Monday 425 feet of con
crete were poured, a remarkable
achievement for the force now em
ployed. Mr. Ryan also visited the new
bridge now about completed over Sil
ver creek, east of Douglas. He says
the bridge will be ready for accept
ance by the commission this week
and predicts that it will be a struc
ture which will be worth the
money paid for it. According to Mr.
Ryan, grading on both sides of the
bridge on the road to connect with
it is progressing now much faster
than heretofore. Toohey & Company
fcfcve recently brought, from the vi
cinity of Phoenix 60 Indians who are
now working with good results.
Mr. Ryan says that it is a hard
matter for road contractors to se
cure men to work who are citizens
of thu United States, this being the
requirement for all public work in
the state. At Benson this week a
road contractor offered $5 a day
for a few men needed for his work,
but did not get all he wanted at
that. . .
No serious damage has been done
on the county roads which have been
built by the county road commission,
though grades have been washed
auay in some places by unprecedent
ed floods.
Federal Aid Promised.
Mr. Ryan says that the project
submitted to the government for
federal aid for the completion of the
paving on the road between Douglas
and Bisbee has now been approved
at Washington and the papers have
been sent to State Engineer Mad
dock, and that it ought not take much
time now to get around to the busi
ness of letting of a contract for pav
ing the middle link between Douglas
and Bisbee. This work will be paid
for by flie state and government on
a 50-50 basis.

Assessment Work Abroaater!
Up to Five Claims Held By
One Individual In Measure
Put Through By Carl Hayden
Congressman Carl Hayden has ad
vised the Bisbee Review that the
measure to suspend assessment work
on mining claims this year has been
passed by the house. Mr. Hayden's
letter follows:
'"I am glaii to advise you that the
houe has paasaed a joint resolution
to suspend the requirement of asst-ss-mnt
work on mining claims during
iho year 1919, which is the same as
the exemption granted by congress in
1917 and 1918 except that this new act
provides 'that no such suspension
shall be granted to any one claimant
for more than five claims.' The joint
resolution also applies to oil placer lo
cations, which was not the case here
tofore." The text of the resolution follows:
Resolved by the senate and house
of representatives of the United
States of America in congress assem
bled, That the provision of section
2324 of the revised statutes of the
United States which requires on each
mining claim located, and until a pa
tent has been issued therefor, not less
than $100 worth of labor to be per
formed or improvements aggregating
such -amount to be made during each
year, be, and the same is hereby, sus
pended- during the calendaar year
lOlli; Provided, That no such sus
pension shall be granted to any one
claimant for more than five claims:
Provided, That every claimant of any-
such mining claim in order to obtain
the benefits of this resolution shall
file or cause to be filed in the office
where the location notice or certifi
cate is recorded, on or before Decem
ber 31, 1919, a notice of his desire to
hold said mining claim under this
resolution.
Section 2. That this resolution shall
not be construed to alter, modify,
amend, or repeal the public resolution
entitled "Joint resolution to relieve
the owners of mining claini3 who
have been mustered into the military
or naval service of the United States
as officers or enlisted men from per
forming assessment work during the
term of such service," approved July
17, 1917.
Amend the title so as to read:
"Joint resolution to suspend the re
quirements of annual assessment
work on certain mining claims during
the year 1919."

Probe Mysterious
Fire at Tombstone
An explosion, which brought the
residents of the neighborhood out to
the rescue to keep the fire from
spreading, occurred yesterday in the
rear of the Nussbaumer tailor shop
in Tombstone. It appears that some
one, either small boys in a playful
mood, or someone with incendiary in
tentions placed a fuse into a bottle
full of gasoline and lighted the fuse,
with the result that flames were
thrown for many feet in all directions
and it took some hard fighting to pre
vent a serious fire. The matter is be
ing investigated.
Say Bonillas Is To
Be Third Candidate
Mexico Presidency
According to recent copies of Elcel
sior and Universal, the two largest
papei-3 published in Mexico City, that
have been received in Bisbee, Agua
Prieta and other border points, there
is now a well defined movement on
foot to sidetrack the candidacy of
both Obregon and Gonzales for the
presidency of Mexico in favor of a
compromise candidate, one who is a
civil and not a military man.
This movement is due, according to
the papers, to the intense bitterness
i hat lias already been injected into
the fight between Obregon and Gon
sales in spite of the fact that the elec
tion is nearly a year off. If the cam
paiem is this bitter at this stage,
it is feared it may reach the fighting
point before the election occurs, or
even af'er, for both men are generals
and both have a large following in the
army.
The "Intellectuals" are behind the
movement for a compromise candi
date and will announce his name with
in the next 15 days. It is the general
opinion that the man chjosen by them
will be Ignacio Bonillas, Mexican am
bassador at Washington. His friends
say he is not an army man, is friendly
to both candidates, has the confidence
of the better element in his own coun
try as well as foreigners, and: is the
only man who can save the situation.
Incidentally, he is a Sonora man
having resided at Nogales for many
years.
Mayor Jacob Erickson is complet
ing arrangements for the purchase ot
a carload of bacon from the surplus
army supplies ordered sold to the
public by Secretary of War Baker.
The price will be around 34 cents a
pound. No bacon is available at El
Paso, the supply point for this dis
trict, but the mayor hopes as "soon as
El Paso gets a supply he will have
the deal arranged for the purchase of
a carload of this commodity. The
cost will be about $12,000. The
mayor is handling the matter through
the rabor unions and also asks that
others who are interested get into
communication with him. If the first
purchase proves a success another
carload of general supplies may be
bought.'
Postmaster Lee R. Eailey expects
word today or tomorrow from Wash
ington as to the way in which the
food can be bought by parcel post.
Mr. Bailey has been besieged wfth in
quiries since the announcement that
the army supplies could be bought
through the various postoffices of the
country and delivered by parcel post,
but so far he has received no advices
or instructions of any sort from
Washington.
