VOTE ON FALL
SET FDR TODAY
Democratic Leaders Claim De
feat for Entire 36; Predict
Treaty Discussion May Pos
sibly End Within 14 Days
WASHINGTON, Oct. 1. The first
vote on amendments to the German
peace treaty will be taken in the sen
ate tomorrow afternoon. Formal
agreement was reached late today by
Republican and Democratic leaders
to call up at 2 o'clock the 36 amend
ments proposed by Senator Fall, Re
publican, of New Mexico, adoption of
which would eliminate from represen
tation on numerous foreign commis
sions created by the treaty. The
agreement provides for discussion un
der the five minute rule and a vote
before adjournment tomorrow night.
Democratic leaders declared tonight
that all of the amendments would be
beaten. Some Republicans admitted
privately that this claim was correct,
but emphasized that the vote coula
not be an accurate test of the lineup
of the forces on the question of rati
fying the treaty, with its league of na
tions covenant Indeed, some Demo
cratic spokesmen ,have stated that
they would inform President Wilson
that as matters stand now the treaty
cannot be ratified without ' reserva
tions. Action by the senate on the Fall
amendments will clear the way for
consideration of the pact and haste
its final disposition. The opinion was
expressed today by a senator, high
in the councils of the majority party,
that treaty discussion might end in
two weeks, with a vote Immediately j
thereafter. I
This view was quite at variance, i
however, with that expressed by Sen-
ator Wolcott. Democrat, of Delaware,
who in the course of a twenty thou
sand word speech declared at the
present rate' of progress it would re
quire two. if not four months, to hear
all that may be said concerning tnoi
wisdom ot ratification.

SAN FRANCISCO, Oct 1. Senator
Hiram W. Johnson, in two addresses
here took arguments in behalf of the
league of nations presented to two
San Francisco audiences by President
Wilson a fortnight ago and sought to
disprove the points in the presiden
tial arguments. He spoke at a lun
cheon and a mass meeting of citizens
here tonight.
President Wilson, in behalf of the
peace treaty and league of nations
covenant, and Senator Johnson
against some parts of the treaty anu
the league as planned in the cove
nant, appeared before the San Fran
cisco audiences exactly two weeks
apart
Senator Johnson appeared before
audience of his own townspeople
and was given a fervent welcome. He
was often interrupted in his address
by applause when he declared that
the league of nations 'will not bring
disarmament, but already has led to
the administration .seeking to pass an
army program calling for a standing
army in this country of 670,000 men,
"costing substantially a billion dollars
a year with conscription in peace timo
of youths of 19 years," and when he
declared that the fight himself and
other senators were waging was to
prevent "British or Asiatic" control
ot American policies.
In his first address at a luncheon
to more than 1600 San Francisco' busi
ness men, the California senator made
reference to the administration mili
tary program.
"I will tell you a secret about this,"
he Bald, "and that Is they will not get
any such army at all."
He declared the award to Japan ot
Shantung with the United States a
party to the deal was the first time
America had ever broken its plighted
word or promise. The promise, he
said, was given Oina when the
United States and other powers
sought China as an ally, that the
United States would protect its s in
terests at ahe peace conference.
He declared President Wilson had
admitted the "wrong" done China and
that Secretary of State Lansing had
said that if the people of . the United
States understood J.he peace treaty
. they would not have it. He declared
ratification of the treaty by the Unit-
ed States would make this country
a party to perpetual wrongs.

Transport Workers Federation
With 36 Unions Included,.
Has Session With Lloyd
George; Outcome a Secret'
LONDON, Oct. 1. For the first
time since the railway strike began
there has been a serious attempt
at mediation, undertaken today by
the powerful Transport fc Workers'
Federation. This organization be
fore commitUng its 36 unions to a
sympathetic strike, decided to see if
it was not possible to bridge the
narrow margin separating the gov
ernment and the National Union of
Railwaymen, namely, whether the
terms already granted the locomo
tive men would also be granted oth
er grades of railwaymen.
The transport workers' deputation
of eleven men, which waited on
Premier Lloyd George for this pur
pose, included some of the most
conservative and far-seeing members
of the Labor party, among others
Harry Gosling, president of the
Transport Workers, John . Robert
Clynes, former food controller: Ar
thur Henderson, James O'Gratly and
James Sexton, Labor TOmhfT-rs of

three and a half hours.
At its conclusion an official state
ment was issued to the effect that
the government would only resume
negotiation provided the railwaymen
first resumed work. The premier,
however, consented to receive the
executive of the National Union of
Railwaymen and accordingly the de
putation of transport workers, with
representatives of the railwaymen.

What went on at the conference
has not been disclosed. The crux
of the whole problem seems to be

TABEIGHT
Showing championship timber, ac
cording to those who saw the battle,
Ralph Lincoln, of Los Angeles, won
the decision last night over Frankie
Manilla, of Douglas, after 10 rounds
of fast fighting in the Smelter City.
Lincoln had all that could be desired
In a main event fighter speed, clev
erness, head work and a jolting punch,
while Manilla, thoroughly outclassed,
fought gamely and consistently, al
though the result was never in doubt.
His courage made him many friends.
Lincoln was given every round.
Lincoln's showing was such aa
brought the opinion that he is now
ready to meet the best boys of his
weight in the country. He had
trained well and every movement was
that of the aggressive but careful
fighter who knows the game and Is
master of. it.
The semi-final, between Johnny
Meyers of Eisbee and George Walthal
of Douglas, was called off because of
the fact that Walthal had a broken
nose.
In the preliminaries the fans
watched two snappy fights and a
slaughter. In the first. Bob Collin
of Bisbee and Al Mouch, also of BIs
bee, fought four hard, choppy rounds
to a draw. Both of these men have
boxed with Loughery, the local wel
terweight, who declared afterwards
that in training with him they had
shown good stuff, and he promised
that fight fans in southern Arizona
will do well to keep their eyes on the
progress of both.
Kid Hartman of Bisbee and Kid
Leach, also known to his friends as
"Studebaker, Shorty," went four
imnds of hot stuff, with the decision
goingj to Hartman. This was a good
fight.
Kid Urin of Bisbee took Kid Landy
of Lowell to such a trimming in three
rounds of their scheduled four-round
battle that the fight was stopped In
the third. rlt was Lundy all to the
merry, with some to spare. -
Al Williams of Douglas refereed.
There was a medium-sized crowd
present.

STRIKE, EM
TELLS SENATE
No Reason for Walkout, Chair
man of U. S. Steel Corpor
ation Asserts; Says Major
ity Men Not in Favor of It
. WASHINGTON. Oct. 1. Declaring
that the question of the open shop
the right of men to work irrespective
of whether he was a member of a
labor union was the sole issue in
the nation-wide steel strike, Judge
Elbert H. Gary, chairman of the
board of United States Steel corpora
tion, told the senate investigating
committee today that his corporation
would never yield. Even now, he
aid. the strike is failing.
"There was no reason for this
strike," said Judge Gary. The men
did Dot want it. It was forced on
them from the outside, by the organ!
zers of labor unions. The open shop
is the Question here the right io
bring about fullest production with
only the interests of the employe, the
employer and the public In sight." ,
Labor leaders, he tbld the commit
tee, were seeking to unionize all in
dustry in. the country. Should their
'efforts be successful, he asserted, in
dustrial decay would follow.
"It means the condition I fear Eng
land is in today," he added, "though
I have hopes she will come out of it.
-Judge Gary had not concluded his
testimony tonight and will be exam
ined again tomorrow. He gave way
for an hour today to several employes
of the corporation's ' mills, who told
the committee they knew of no reason
for the strike. All agreed that the
men who voluntarily responded to the
strike call were' mostly foreigners,
and one of them, John J. Martin, a
Youngstown machinist, attacked the
leaders of the national steel workers'
committee. '
"I think John Fitzpatrick (chair
man of the workers' committee), with
Win. Z. Foster (secretary of the com
mittee), his ablest assistant, heads a
band of buccaneers who will over
throw this government if they are not
stopped," said Martin, who ' explained
that he himself formerly was a union
man. They were engaged, he said,
in "scuttling the American Federa
tion of Labor."
Martin testified that the steel em
ployes at Youngstown, "American anu
foreigners alike," had been terror
ized by threats to burn houses and
kill children. Judge Gary also said
in the course of his testimony that
the company had much "hearsay evi
dence" that such threats had been
made against men who would not Join
in the strike. In the course of his
testimony. Judge Gary reviewed con
ditions leading up to the strike, ana
discussed at length his refusal to
meet . the workers' national commit
tee. To have negotiated with the
committee, he said, would have been
a departure from the company's pol
icy to treat directly with its employes
and would have damaged the prestige
of the open shop policy.
Discussing this point with Senator
Borah, Republican, of Idaho, he said
condition? might arise under which
he might talk with union leaders not
employed by the company.
"Provided they said fairly that
they represented 15 per cent of the
men employed, for instance," he said.
"I might discuss the wishes of that
15 per cent with -them."
Mr. Gary brushed aside the charges
of union leaders that the corporation
had mistreated its men with the state
ment that in no basic industry in the
world' were the men better treated
or paid better wages. Later he went
Into welfare work of . the company
among its employes and , presented
figures to show that employes gener
ally received approximately three
times as much now. as they -did in
1914.
Although pressed by Senator Ken
yon, chairman o fthe investigating
committee, Mr. Gary refused to dis
cuss the efforts by President Wilson
to bring about an understanding be
tween the corporation officials and
the union . leaders 'and avert the
Btrike.
"When the president communicates
with a private citizen," he said, 1 "it
Isn't -courtesy, for the person1 so ap
proached to say what the communica
tion was." ,
Reverting at the 'end of the day to
his view of the situation. Judge Gary
said: .
"The general puollo now require
increased production. That may even
necessitate increased hours, up to the
limit set by the willingness of work
ers and theor health. But there Is no
use of talking about increased wages
and decreased production and at the
same time roaring about rising prices,
I'm in favor of high wages but there
comes a time when there is a limit.
"In my view prices are too high
right now. . The right way to do Is to
lower, them .first,- and decrease wages
last That Is the policy of the steei
Industry."

Johnson Greeted by
Crowds in Frisco
(Continued from Page One)
George capable, insisted vehemently
upon the granting to the British em
pire of six votes to one vote of the
United States, although it was per
fectly obvious to Lloyd George that
the six votes for which he fought so
fervently were of no advantage to
him whatsoever. He made it plain
that an empty honor had been accord
ed Canada, New Zealand, South Af
rica, Australia and ibe. self-governing
colony, India, and this boon coveted
by Great Britain and eagerly sought
by her colonies they and he knew be
cause he tells us. it was of neither
consequence nor value nor import
ance. "The difficulty with the explana
tion of the president is that it was at
variance with the facts and, as usual,
the facts, the inexorable facts, make
the issue with Mr. Wilson.
"The entire contention of Mr. Wil
son depends upon two propositions ;
first, that the assembly has no power
an dis a mere debating society, and
secondly, that the power of the league
resides in the council, where Great
Britain, as he inferentially Insists,
will ever have but one vote. .
"It is not the fact, as the president
says, that in case of a quarrel be
tween Great Britain and the United
States, the British empire would be
deprived of her six votes. The colon
ies of Great Britain, even including
India,, were taken into the league as
separate and distinct entities, with
membership as full and powers as
great as those of any sovereign na
tion. Not only this, they actually
signed in their separate and individ
ual capacities the treaty of peace and
the league of nations, and by its very
terms in this first article became
'original members of the league.'
"Equally in error is the president
in his designation of the assembly.
It is not a mere 'debating society.' It
is not a bod yof impotency and futil
ity. If it were, the league would be
an egregrious fraud. It would be un
der Mr. Wilson's construction a mere
world governing oligarchy of the five
great nations. The academic and
idealistic conception of a grtat forum
to redress the wrongs of the weak
would be a mere sham and pretext
and a shabby diplomatic trick.
"If Mr. WJlson's conception of the
assembly be sound the weak nations
of the earth would forever be in sub
jection, forever on their knees to the
organized power f the five great na
tions. It Mr. Wilson's description ot
the assembly of the leagu be correct,
instead of securing self-determination
of peoples, and justice to the weak,
we would have all the minor nations
and all the smaller peoples of the
whole world bound in perpetual
shackles to the five great master na
tions. Mr. Wilson, as usual, is wrong
in his constructions of the powers ot
the assemhly. The assembly; so far
from being a 'debating society,' is the
reservoir of all the power of the
league.
The most Important function of the
league of nations Is to prevent war
by arbitration of international dis
putes, hut every dispute between na
tions according to article 15, .upon
the demand of either party to the dis
pute, shall be referred to the assem
bly. Consequently, the assembly be
comes not only the court of the first
instance, but the ultimate tribunal to
decide such as well.
"Let us see then what would hap
pen if a dispute should arjse between
Great Britain and the United States
and be referred to the assembly as
it must be referred if Great Britain
demands it. The United States being
a party to the dispute, would have no
vote in the assembly; Great Britain,
being a party to the dispute, would
have no vote in the assembly. The
five British dependencies, however,
would have their five votes in the as
sembly. There is no conceivable pro
cess of reasoning by which this places
the two disputants, Great Britain ana
the United States, upon an equality.
Great Britain starts with five votes
in the assembly; the United States
with none. The argument is made
that bo long as the United States has
one friend in the council it would
prevent any adverse action by the
council, and that if it did not have
at least one friend in the council
there would be enough votes to cast
the decision against the United States
without the ifve votes of the British
dependencies." ' '

STRIKING FOR POWER
IN NEW YORK striking cigar-makers are demanding among other
things that the proprietors of the factory shall not enter his own
shop where the men are at work during working hours. The
United Mine Workers of America, whose representatives are in
Buffalo today, have formulated a demand upon the operatives for
an increase of 60 per cent in their pay, a six-hour day, a five-day
week with time and a half for overtime anil double time for Sunday.
If th5 mine owners do not grant these demands a strike on November
1st is threatened. The steel industiy is at a standstill because the
owners of the mills will not give in to men who propose to put an end
to capitalism with the general strike. Even more drastic are the de
mands of the pressmen in New York, who are asking of their em
ployers the permanent abolition of all contracts inasmuch as the
uaion does not wish to be bound in the future- by any agrements.
No one can witness the general state of labor unrest and not
be struck by the peculiar nature of the demands made upon em
ployers by the organized workers. Strikes in effect and strikes threat
ened are not as a rule strikes for more wages. Yes, the miners want
more pay, but if that were all there were to it the operatives would
grant it and "pass the buck'' on the consumer. That-is to say, they
would let the buyer of coal pay the increase by advancing the price
of this commodity. Nor is the grievance or alleged grievance of the
workmen based upon wretched working conditions. Never were men
better provided for than they are today. Employes in many cases
are stockholders in the plants where theywork. In other plants they
are allowed to share in the profits by bonus and otherwise. Wel
fare organizations have provided comfortable homes, free medical
attendance and places of entertainment. Today the thrifty workman
owns his automobile, his home and himself. He was never more -his
own master, never less the slave of another man.
What, then, is the cause of his discontent? Inability to meet
the increasing cost living? The decreasing value of the dollar has
to be sure been hard upon many of us, but of all classes of men the
one that depends upon a trade or even upon unskilled labor has been
the least injured, while the salaried man or woman, the clerk and
the salesman, have felt the blow most severely, and yet have made
,th least public complaint.
We believe that the unrest today is largely artificial. Men who
are at work do not want to strike. It is natural that they should
seek for more money for their services, but they have nowhere
shown a disposition by themselves to sacrifice their present jobs in
the effort to do so. It is the agitator, the syndicalist and the Bol
shevist at heart who are stirring up the trouble and using the work
ingman to feather their own foul nests
The steel strike, for instance, is a strike for power. Men who
have proclaimed their belief in the principles of the I. W. W. are at
the head of it. They are trying to compel their steel mill owners to
give them "recognition," that is, the right to dictate the economic
policy of the business. When they have obtained complete control
of the situation the mill owners might as well turn over their plants
to them, for they will have nothing further to say about how they
shall be operated.
I NOW COMES THE CAVE WOMAN
IF THE ADVICE of most of the speakers at the recent international
conference of women physicians is to be generally followed by
the gentler sex, so-called, the "frivolous girl with a penchant for
the company of young men" will give place to the "sensible out
door girl of the cave woman type.'V
' There are evidences that the outdoor girl has been with us for
some time. Nobody who pores over - the illustrated magazines and
newspapers can have escaped noting the increasing intrusion of the
girl who goes in for strenuous athletics. Pages devoted to her ac
tivities have shown her striving heroically at such formerly purely
masculine pastimes as football, baseball and track work, to say noth
ing of taking a more vigorous place in swimming, tennis and other
outdoor work. ,
Mere man may well shudder at this rise of the deadlier of the
species. Perhaps the war is to blame for it, just as it is to blame
for high prices, the League of Nations, crime and everything else
that is the matter with the world today. So we'll have to take the
"cave woman" who does the high jump or boots the elusive pigskin
down the chalk-marked field along with the other little annoyances
of the day. She will be a healthy thing, no doubt, and all mere men
can pray for is that she will not carry her boisterousness to the
cave-day methods of wooing by developing a fondness "for the com
pany of young men" who may not be quite ready Tor the change.
DANGEROUS DAYS
FROM every side come reports of deaths due to the imbibing of
such substitutes for alcoholic drinks as hair tonic, wood alco
hol and other very dangerous fluids. The mortality due to this
cause has increased so alarmingly of late that the federal au
thorities are doing all in their power to stamp out the practice. That
it will be difficult is apparent in the lack of success which the gov
ernment's crusade has had so far.
Also, those who seek the strong waters of the Barleycorn family
are beginning to chafe more than ever over the continuance of the
wartime prohibition act. With the First division of regulars soon
to be demobilized and only a skeleton army remaining at home and
abroad it would seem that the emergency is over. The ratification
of the peace treaty, at least, should apprise us of the fact which
we have long suspected that the war is over.
So long as this law is on the statute books it should be en
forced. The present general disregard of the law, however, is not
an inspiring commentary on our methods at a time when we are
telling some of our frenzied aliens that our laws are based on com
mon sense and Justice and made to be obeyed.
The president of the suffrage association predicts ratification
of the federal amendment by next February. And the association is
said to pride , itself oij never making a prediction which has not

proximately 60 vacancies . for school
teachers in the state, according to
statistics compiled at the office of
the state superintendent of education.

way for teachers going into other
lines of endeavor. Prescott, where
there are ten vacancies, is offering
as the highest pay 5110, with a hope
ful appendix of ''possibly more."
One teacher is needed in Apache
county at a one-teacher school five
miles from Springerville at a salary
of $90. Board and room may be se
cured there at from $20 to $30 a
month. Another country school teach

PEPPFS DIARY. IN BISBEE
Oct. 1. Up early, and found it a beautiful morning, which forced me to
Tammany Hall for a glass of near-beer before breakfast. Did chat there for
a time, finding I had made a mistake in the paper through being too lax
with my informants. Out of humor until I met with some prize fighters,
with whom I talked literature for a moment, but found them apathetic, so
I turned to the fights at Douglas and soon was arguing hotly, which pleased
me. mightily. To the barber, who gave some gossip, and, shaved me well,
bo I thought I looked nice all day, which is a little vanity 1 am loath to get
rid of. Saw a fine, looking woman on Main street, and though God knows
that I think paint and powder on a lady's face all out of place, yet it did
teem lo me that she had" used a little with good effect. I hope she lives in
Bisbee so that I may glimpse her again. In the afternoon much excitement
Over the baseball scores, and to my surprise' found that Cincinnati has many
friends in the district. Lost my 'cigarette money for the week on Chicago,
but not worried, as I have hidden some away from the wife, who otherwise
might be. strict about advancing any to me. To the office, where I tried to
work, but found 'too much baseball in the air for me to keep my mind on
my business, so to the street again. Heard a merry story from my friend of
the Cedar Brook, whose wife hath two kittens as pets, which have become
a nuisance. So he resolved that they should be sent away, but while, he
was, putting them in a box, his wife did make such a' bother about it, and
did weep so tearfully, that he was constrained, to give them back to her, and
now he fears that he will have to buy her a si'.k waist before she will Bmile
at him again. But had he been married as long as I, he would know differ
ent, and would save "the shirtwaist. At the office late, waiting for the fight
returns, and then to bed; well content and full of pie and milk.

If the Cincinnati baseballers knew yesterday how they had upset the
dope in Bisbee they might have gone easier in the fourth inning.

The crope hanging from front doors here,' end pinned to the arms of '

kvav vnnK. Oct. 1. Although de-
on were considered favoricmfw mfwy
lion, were considered favorable from
the speculative standpoint, snares oi
ttmt frrmin were almost the only ones
to show reactionary tendencies in to
day's very active and Droaaer siock
market.
This may have been due to the byra
tions of Crucible Steel, which, added 9
tmints to it3 upward course during the
morning at the new maximum of 255,
but suffered a precipitate decline or
18 points later, closing at a loss of 5Ms
points.
An encouraging feature or tne ses
sion was the advance of rails, second
ary as well as high shares rising 1 to
3 points on the mast impressive Dur
ing oftransportations iu several weeks
So far as couldbe learned, the only
basis for the strength of rails was the
statement attributed to Director Gen
eral Hines confirming the general Im
pression mat tne rauroaas are to De
restored to private ownership at the
end of the year.
Among some of the specialties much,
of the advance was retained, but in
steels, equipments, motors and rails
reductions of 1 to 5 points rollowed
the late rise of call loans to 10 per
cent. Sales 1,575,000 shares.
Utilities contributed to the moder
ate strength of the bond market, chief
ly American Telephone 6's, Liberty is
sues eased and internationals were
steady. Total sales, par value, $15,
550,000. Old United States were un
changed on call.
THE CORN MARKET
CHICAGO, Oct 1. Predictions that
bankin garrangements to grant com
mercial credits to Europe would soon
be completed, helped today to give an
upward swing to the corn market
Prices, although Unsettled at the close
were lc to 2c net higher, with De
cember $1.26 to $1.26 and May
$1.24 to $1.24. Oats gained c to
lc. In provisions the outcome rang
ed from 25c decline to 5c advance.
Notwithstanding that the corn mar
ket wavered a little at the opening
and also at the lose, sentiment as a
whole was strongly in favor of the
bulls. The fact that continued rains
expected to curtail the country move
ment furnished the initial stimulus to
buyers. Pronounced advances in the
corn market, however, did not take
place until gossip began to circulate,
which groused hopes of a better out
let lor the United States general ex
port trade and therefore substantial
although indirect benefit to holders of
corn. Seaboard buying continued to
afford independent strength to the
oats market.
Lower quotations on hogs tended at
first to weaken provisions. Later,
however, there weer erallies owing to
upturns iu grain and to signs of lard
sales to Europe.

LETTERS TO THE
EDITOR
Dear Pepy: .
The other day when a I was out tak
ing BubscriptionB to .The Review, I
stopped at a man's house and I aRked
him if he took ; The Review and he
looked to me just as if I had asked him
If he ever ate and he naid, "Why, of
course I do; I couldn't get along, with
out The Review and the famous Pepys
Diary, eo we became Quite chummy
and we had a long talk and he asked
me why The Review didn't start a
movement for concrete stairways up
and down these hills surrounding Bis-
bee in place of the awful looking
wooden ones which are always re
quiring attention (and which my
friend said they never got) and dear
Pepy, I agree with this paper that
concrete Btalrways would be a real ad
vantage and of decided utility to what
we have now, and considering the fact
that It must' take an awful lot jt
money to keep the wooden steps in re
pair I can't see why the city council
shouldn't take the matter in hand or
else the citizens might form a taxpay
ers' league and take the matter up;
anyway, Pepy, what do you thing of it?
Sincerely yours for better steps,
VOX POPULI.

Reviving of the famous old Tus
cumbia silver mine Is a reality, the
first shipment of over S000 pounds
of material, supplies and other art
icles leaving Piescott recently for
the camp now being established. Be
hind this movement are George King
don, manager of the United Verde
Extension and other prominently
known operators of Jerome.
It is understood that capital Is
available for carrying out exploration
for months ahead, and with the prac
tical ability of those now interested
the outlook for this property is at
tended with glowing possibilities.
Preceding the closing of this bond
and lease deal, Mr. Kingdon devoted
several days in making critical exam
inations of old workings and surface
showings, as well as ascertaining'1 a
broad conception of the mineraliza
tion by an elaborate line of sampling
that required over two weeks by a
large force of miners, each and every
movement proving satisfactory, and
action to begin operating has result
ed. The above mining people have
secured practically every share . or
outstanding stock, and this action or
those interested, combined with the
determination to revive such a high
grade property of early days is nat
urally weighed in mining circles of
this field as one of the most import
ant in silver " mining that has ever
been consummated in recent years.
The Tuscumbia in the late 70's and
early 80's had a remarkable produc
tive ability, and even exceeding the
Peck in actual bullion output. It is
situated on the northern slope of the
Bradshaws and about four miles west
of the Peck. Like al? mines enjoying
a bonanza rating in the long ago, its
internal life was attended with strife,
litigation followed, and finally the
property suspended. Subsequently
leasers took charge, the . high grade
zones were chlorided, and finally, the
inevitable occurred in it being aban
doned. The new operators will first
establish communication to the works
by constructing a new wagon road or
about 1000 feet in length, and coinci
dentiy mine work . starts also. Prin
cipal shareholders of thp Tuscumbia
are Frank H. Williams and. B. H
Smith of Pres'cott, James H. Morgan
of Phoenix, Mrs. Steve Prince of
California, and some people of Pres
cptt, holding small blocks of stock.
