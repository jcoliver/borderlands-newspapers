PARIS, Feb. 13 (By the Associated
Press.) The Bourgeois proposition
for an inter-allied military force to
enforce peace was defeated by an
overwhelming vote at the meeting ot
the society of nations commission to
day. ,The Fjench and Czecho-Slovaks
were the only representatives voting
in the affirmative.
The draft of the society of nations i
plan was then unanimously adopted
as a whole. The final draft consists of
26 articles. ,
President Wilson will personally
read the draft to a plenlary meeting I
oi the peace conterence tomorrow.
The conference will not be asked to
finally adopt it at this time.
The Japanese delegation presented
an amendment providing that racial
discrimination should not be tolerated
in immigration laws.
Several delegates urged that this
would open such a large question that
great delay might ensue and the mat
ter was adopted without a vote. -

Efforts of the German authorities to
recruit volunteers for the army have
been' unproductive, but the official
view here is that they may be more
successful later. Men who have been
in the army for four years have no
great vlesire to continue in the fight
ing force, but it is expected that they
will find civil life in Germany less at
tractive than the army and therefore i
probably will be willing to enlist later.
Recruiting also is hindered by the fact
that nearly every hamlet is trying to
raise its own defense forces.
Many former soldiers are joining
the local forces and are staying at
home to protect their communities
rathe- than join the national forces.
The German force on the eastern
frontier is divided into two armies.

DOUGLAS, Ariz., Feb. 1 3. Alertness on the part of
the military police today probably saved the Douglas Y. M.

of unique design and which was filled with nitroglycerine.
The bomb was found unde r a small bridge that spans one

clock on the bomb was set for 10:30 and it was only a few
minutes before that hour that the infernal machine was found.
Whether the bomb was intended for the Y. M. C A. or
not has not been learned, but it is generally conceded by the
members of the military police and attaches of the department
of justice that regardless of the original intention of the per
son placing the bomb at the place found, the association
building and those in the immediate vicinity would have
been wrecked. .
The bomb was turned over to Captain Wright of the

Phantom Hills
Are Viewed by
: Warren Folk
With Moon as Magic Lantern,
Beautiful Optical Illus
ion Is Improved
Phantom mountains, optical il
lusions of more than passing
berauty, were screened on a sky of
blue in an amphitheater of the
Burro mountains last night.
Warren, the bowl in the hills of
this district, formed the Grecian
theater, where the audience saw
the screened illusion.
The gap below Warren formed
the base of the screen. The arch
ed, blue sky to the southwest
made up the remainder of the
screen.
A moon was the magic lantern
which threw the illusion on the
screen. 4
Atmospheric conditions were re
sponsible for the phenomenum.
Rising above the outline of the
San Jose mountains behind Naco
were the phantom" mountains.
Their contour was the same as
that of the San Jose range. Their
sides appeared in blue and white
-contrast, identical with the snowy
sides of the real range. For sev
eral hoars they were visible.
Explanation ''of the phenome
num is found in peculiar atmos
pheric conditions. It may be that
sulphur smoke in the valley so
reflected the rays of the moon as
. to create- a mirage mountain. In
the same manner it is thought
moisture in the air from evapor
ating snows on the San Jose range
mav have created the illusion.

Mt tlia acpii1h nkl.'1tf moatino1 r f
the Bisbee-Douglas bureau of employ- j
ment for returned soldiers and sail
ors, held at the Y. M. C..A. last night,
Governor Campbell's letter in reply
to the communication sent by the bu
reau last week asking that the legis
lature take immediate action to re
lieve the present unemployment situa
tion, was read. The governor's letter
said:
"My Dear Mr. Erickson:
"The appeal made by yourself and
other residents, business houses and
union organizations to me asking that
early action be taken by the legisla
ture, in the way of emergency legisla
tion looking to the earfy commence
ment of work on roads, reclamation
projects, etc., was today referred to
both houses of the legislature. Bills
having this object in view were intro
duced at my instigation early in the
season, are now pending before these
bodies, and their early enactment
would fulfill your desires in this re
spect, that is, provide work for th
many men throughout the state who
are now idle. The original purpose of
these measures was to provide em
ployment for returning soldiers but
the projects are of such magnitude
that they can easily take care not
only of them but the civilians who are
in need of employment.
Assures Co-operation
"I trust that the legislature will
see the necessity of granting the re
quest voiced in your telegram and
thus remedy a situation .which cannot j
otherwise be provided for. Anything I
can do in behalf of yourself and the
other signers of the telegram along
the lines indicated, kindly feel free to
command me.
"With assurances of my high es
teem, I remain,
"Sincerely vours,
"THOMAS E. CAMPBELL,
"Governor."
J. C. White, chairman of the bureau,
said last night that the situation is far
worse than it was a week previous,
He urged the business men of Bisbee
to rally to the cause and not forget
that now the war is. over that it is the
duty of every community to see that
returned soldiers and sailors are taken
care of in the way of finding them
employment.
I. C. E. Adams, chairman Cochise
county supervisors, 'said that within
the next ten days or so he thought
that between 200 and 300 men would
be given employment on the county
roads.
Little Interest Shown
Mr. Adams also said that interest in
the work seemed apparently licking.
He was surprised, he, said, to find such
a small gathering of business men at
the meeting last night. The clergy of
Bisbee were also conspicuous- by their
absence with, the exception of one
minister.
. A special meeting for the purpose of
petitioning the legislature, will be held
next Wednesday evening at 7:30
o'clock at the Y. M. C. A. building.
Every business man, lawyer, union
man and minister is urgently asked
to be present. A petition will be
drawn up at this meeting, asking the
legislature to create an emergency
measure immediately that will afford
relief to the present situation. The
present condition, it is said, warrants
such a move and an overflow meeting
is desired by the members of the -bureau
of employment for returned sol
diers and sailors.
INDUSTRIAL UNREST
DEBATED IN COMMONS
(B Review Ieascil Wire
LONDON. Feb. 13. The debate on
industrial unrest was opened in the
house of commons, by William Brace,
labor member of South Glamorgan,
who moved the official labor party
amendment in reply to the speech
from the throne. The amendment ex
pressed regret at the absence of ariy
mention in the speech of a definite
proposal for dealing with the political
causes of industrial unrest and for
securing in this connection working
hours and conditions of labor that
would establish a higher standard 'of
life and social well being for the peo
ples. Mr. Brace declared that not a little
of the responsibility for the unrest
lay in the failure to give responsible
trade unions officials such settlements
by negotiations as they were entitlea
to receive, ancf in the granting of
concessions regarding terms after un
official stoppages of work, which con
cessions had been refused to trade
union leaders before the stoppage.

MAJOR BROPIIY TELLS
OF RED CROSS WORK
AT LUNCHEON CLUB
Interesting to a high degree was the
address delivered vesterdav at the
weekly gathering of the Warren Dis-!
trict Luncheon club, at the Copper
Queen hotel by Maj. William H.
Brophy. in which he described his ey
periences in France while serving
with the American Red Cross society.
Mr. Brophy described the difficulties
encountered by the Red Cross in ef
fecting orsa nidation of the store house
futilities of Trris and vicinity, and
thtj gradual extension of ths service
until it covered all parts of France
neld by th; allied armies. His per
sonal part in tUis feat, he dealt with
lightly, the pronoun "I" being distin
guished by its abseuce from his ad
dress. . .
A stirring incident in connection
with the earl summer campaign was
related by Mr. Brophy, when he told
of the -rr.Tivul of the Yanks on the
Chateau Thierry front where the Huns
were held in their triumphant march
to Paris.
Prolonged applause followed the
completion of the speech and comment
made by those who heard it was en
thusiastic as it gave enlightenment
on subjects in doubt in the minds of
"many local people.
The attendance at the luncheon was
larger than ordinary.

DRIVE SUCCESS NOW
DEPENDS Oil BISBEE
Warren District, Only One in
WhicFi Subscriptions
Are Lagging i
Success of the drive for funds in
the campaign for relief in the near
east, depends in Cochise county on
the total subscription raised in the
Warren district. Douglas, Tombstone.
Naco and other communities in the
county have already oversubscribed,
and this is the only district where the
drive is lagging.
Captains and team workers will
make their second report of funds sub
scribed at a luncheon this noon at the
Copper Queen hotel. The captains
will meet at the commercial club
rooms at 12 o'clock sharp to report
to the treasurer. At 12:30 o'clock the
luncheon will be served, and it is espe
cially desired that all workers be pres
ent. Douglas Over Top
Douglas went over the top yester
day following a brief conference of
workers in that city with T. O. Mc
Grant. county director. Their subscrip
tion to the county's quota will reach
approximately . $12,000. two-thirds of
which will come from the city's war
chest fund.
In the Warren district reports to
date have been less than even the
most pessimistic could have expected.
Unless greater efforts are made todav
and tomorrow the district will fall far
below what it is expected to raise.
"We must get in and work hard."
declared Mr. McGrath last night, "to
assure the success of the drive. Co
chise county's success depends now
on what is subscribed in this district,
which means that many will have to
Sive more than this amount, -we will
be unable to make the mark which
has been set for us."

Sp?oSai to Tho Review)
PHOEMX. Ariz.. Feb. 13. The ex
act progress which has been made in
the united drive for relief in the near
east is not known.
This was explained at state head
quarters as due to the fact that, only
seven of the 14 counties in the state
una sent in rennrts tr Aiin nnj fi
these seven counties the sums report-1
ed represent only the county seats or
at most the larger towns. i
The incomplete total of the first two :
days of the drive amounted to ?30,000. '
This figure is looked upon by the com-'
mittee as far below what it should be
if the sum of $150,000 is to be raised :
in this state, and that amount has j
been established as Arizona's quota.

"MUST MAKE VICTORY
LIBERTY LOAN MORE
ATTRACTIVE," GLASS
Secretary of Treasury Seeks
Wide Powers in Fixing
Rates of Interest
T!v Rvir-w leased Wir
WASHINGTON". Feb. 13. Secretary
Glasa today told the house ways and
means committee that it was apparent
"something must be done to make the
bonds or notes of the Victory Liberty
loan more attractive than their prede
cessors" and asked that congress give
him authority to fix rates and deter
mine exemptions from taxation accord
ing to financial conditions existing
when the loan is floated in April.
The head of the nation's financial
system also urged that authority be
given the war finance corporation to
make advances to exporters not to ex
ceed $1,000,000,000 and that the pur
poses for which the treasury may
make loans to foreign governments
be broadened. Mr. Glass said both
provisions were necessary to restora
tion of the country's foreign trade and
would be mutually helpful to this gov
ernment and the allies.
Mr. Glass told the committee that at
the rate disbursements were being
made, it was apparent only a radical
reduction in the remaining months of
the fiscal year could bring the year's
expenditures within the $18,000,000,000
which former Secretary McAdoo had
hoped would cover the government's
expenses.
Decrease is Shown
Cash disbursements during the first
ten days of February showed a "very
gratifying decrease." But Mr. Glass
pointed out that heavy payments on in
formal war contracts were being held
in abeyance until congress acted on
pending legislation. Under these cir
cumstances and with, a floating debt of
$5,000,000,000 in treasury certificated
increasing approximately $1,400,000,
000 a month, he thought the commit
tee would not be surprised by his re
commendation for authorization of an
additional $5,000,000,000 issue of
bonds. There remain unissued under
previous legislation slightly in excess
of $5,000,000,000.
"It is needless to say that the
treasury does not contemplate the is
sue in connectoion with the Victory
loan of any such amount of bonds
as $10,000,000,000," Mr. Glass said,
adding that "it seemed, wise to sug
gest an increase iu a ngure wihtn
would seem to represent the maximum
possible amount of the bonded debt
growing out of the war."
Offers Alternative
As an alternative to the issue of
bonds, he suggested authorization of
an issue of notes limited to $10,000,
000,000 and an increase in the maxi
mum amount of treasury certificates
from $3,000,000,000 to $10,000,000,000,
not that the three items should be at
all cumulative, but that the treasury
should have the power to finance the
government's operations in the most
economical way.
It may be desirable to adopt all of !
. . ,
these methods in succession," Mr.
Glass said. "Conditions in April
might be such that it would be wise to
issue a short time note bearing a rela- i

Exemptions Proposed
Mr. Glass appeared before the com
mittee in executive session and his
statement later was made public at
the treasury department. He was ac
companied by Assistant Secretaries
Leffingwell and Rathbone. Commit
tee members said that throughout the
discussion with the officials many
questions were asked regarding the
broad powers sought. The members
said it was apparent that approval
would not be given for all the auth
ority that was asked.
Exemption from taxation to be car
ried by the new issue, Mr. Glass said,
would not be greater than that con
ferred in the first Liberty bond act
nor less than exemption from state
and local taxes.
Mr. G lass added that it was essen
tial also to devise some plan for pro
tecting the holders of existing Liberty
bonds, suggesting that additional ex
emptions from taxation be given those
who subscribed to the new issue.
Immediate steps to set up a sinking
fund for -the retirement of the war
debt was recommended.

800 Soldiers in Butte
Officials of the two organizations of
miners who are on strike declarea
their belief today that none of their
members was responsible for the ex
plosion. There are now approximately S00
soldiers in Butte and with the excep
tion of cases of isolated assaults upon
miners returning from work, both the
police department and . military re
port the situation well in hand. The
police guarding approaches to the
mines from violence on the part of the
pickets, reported that more miners
had gone to work today than had
been the average for the first three
days of the week, but mining company
officials said they had not registered
any appreciable increase in the men

Arizona's Birthday
Sevsn years ago today in Phoenix was witnessed the birth of a new
state and the addition of a new star to the flag of the United States.
Arizona became officially the forty-eighth state in the union.
Since then Arizona has progressed at times, made rapid strides here
and less rapid gains there. Her wealth has increased. Her homes hare
grown in number. Her industries have become larger, and her part in
the nation's business has placed her in first ranks on per capita basis.
Seven years have passed since the Valentine state was admitted.
Each of these years has been remarkable for one or more features.
But this last year has established Arizona a record of which any state
in the union might be proud. , During the year she ha3 earned for herself
a premier place in national service, in patriotic subscriptions to war agen
cies and federal financial drives, in per capita draft response and enlist
ments and in health of her manhood.
Some record for a youngster!
The Child of Arrogance
Ever since the signing of the armistice we have been looking for one
. sign of repentance from Germany. Everything else has come to attention.
Defiance, proud and exasperating difference, greed, grasping and avari
cious appeal for everything Germany wants from the peace conference
have characterized the national expression.
The Hun is as arrogant now as before last November 11; he is as
arrogant as when he set out to bring a world to his feet.
And the ctild born of hi3 arrogance has been the decision of the peace
council to place Germany in a military position where it will be impos
- sibie for her to recommence hostilities and to "make Germany realize
that we are the conquerors and that it is not a 'white peace' that we are
seeking to impose on her."
Chancellor Ebert's opening speech to the German national assembly
probably prompted the supreme war council to issue its latest ultimatum
concerning the peace which shall be ijnposed on the Hun. When arro
gance led the German president to declare that the armistice terms are
ruthless and when he threatened renewal of war, the time had arrived to
warn him.
Prof. Hans'Delbrueck, historical and publicist of Germany, added to
the arrogancies of Hunland and may have influenced the announcement
that a 'white peace' will not be tolerated. His defiance took form in a
declaration that if the allies, insist on imposing terms which will make of
Germany a wage slave of its enemies "Germany would arise at the proper
moment and again plunge the world into war."
Sice the feigning of the armistice Germany has persisted in national
arrogance. Every leader, every spokesman of the country has put forward
the old and musty argument of German supremacy.
A Germany repentant, a Germany willing: and ready .to make repara
tion and to assume its role in the world as a beaten nation, a Germany
purged of kaiserism. might expect frcm the allies a different treatment.
But the child of arrogance is rigid discipline.
Germany will live to repent.

We Have With Us Today
The first of the year brings always a deluge of mail oder catalogues.
. Frcm every corner of the nation come glittering pages of advertising
offering glittering bargains or almost every variety. Mails are overtaxed
with their burden, especially through January, February and March.
First come catalogues announcing January sales of linens and white
goods, dress goods and shoes. These are the annual clearance sales
catalogues the new year's bate of numerous mail-order houses depicting
bargains in stuff several years old and often of inferior grade.
In February these catalogues are replaced by the seed catalogue the
flowering, vegetableing cover and pages filled with accounts of how each
brand of seed is the only-original-budder and breeder.
March sees a revival of the dress goods, drygoods pamphlets, when
the annual spc-ag clearances are announced to dispose of what was not
sold during the January sale.
Latest of the bargain counter mail order .catalogues to arrive in this
district, announce sales of automobile supplies and accessories. The
bouse sending them out has evidently copied the records of the secretary
of state of automobile licenses issued. Nearly every motor car owner
of the district has received one of their booklets.
Their story is the same as that of all mail order houses. The buyer
sees illustrations which may or may not represent the article he is buy
ing. He cannot see and handle the goods. A few standard articles are
carried to add dignity and appearance to the catalogue, and alongside
thestandard articles are listed less standard goods. The buyer, lured by
fine illustrations and what he thinks attractive prices, purchases infer
ior goods. .The purchaser gets what he pays for, because mail order
houses handle inferior goods in order to offer attractive prices.
Home stores are integral parts of each community. They place their
goods where you can determine what you are buying, where you see and
handle your purchase. You contribute to the support of your community
when you patronize them. You help pauperize your community when
you send money to mail order concerns.
The best economy is to us mail order catalogues to start fires on
these cold, snappy mornings.

PHOENIX, Feb. 13. The rerts of

sity some approximate definite sum.
tither by a mill tax on the assessed
valuation of the state or by the ap
propriation ofa fixed percentage of the
state revenue.
The appointment of eight regents
by the governor with terms running
from one to seveu years, as provided
in senate bill 34 is endorsed as a sys
tem nust likely to fit the university
above the rlane of politics.
The reports also outline a building
plan to extend over a period of years,
which calls for extensive additions and
improvements, thirteen in number.
These include:
Third story on the girls' dormitory;
addition to the dining hall; new cam

tory; women's building; acquiring of
adjoining land for campus nuroosps
establishment and equipment of a !
campus; new science building; astron

The report recommends that the
girls' and boys' dormitories be fur

the general university maintenance.
The senate report is signed by El

while Barrows, O'Neill and Howard

Arizona's Second Industry
Stockmen of the state are meeting this week in Phoenix in the
twelfth annual session of the Arizona Cattle Growers' association. Nearly
five hundred cattlemen ax ttending the maeting, one of the most Import
ant in the history of their organization.
Stock raising is Arizona's second industry in magnitude and import
ance. In it are engaged a large part of the state's population, and from
it a much greater proportion of the state is supported. Its success means
weaH'i to Arizona; its failure or handicaps thrown in its way means that
this nate will be retarded just that much in progress and growth.
Many important problems ahve been placed before the convention for
solution, including the control of 21.00.000 acres of public lands unap
propriated f.vA unreserved which the cattlemen would open to grazing by
ren:cving the IGO-acre lease provision. Encroachments by sheepmen on
cattle raTiss ?r- also occupying the minds of the stock raisers.
Kvtry oii'-ouragement and' every aid should-be extended the cattle
men by the state lsilafure. They have spent years in building. up their
industry, and have assumed risks and taken chances hardly warranted
by Inve.-tujf.-iit made and labor devoted. To assure their future they
must solve problems more puzzling and complex than any other of the
state's industries.
Conventions like the one now in session have served to bring the
cattlemen into closer organization for the puipose of making known their
rseedi and wants and for co-operation in securing necessary recogni
tion and !'-ei.lation. Each year has seen them advance their mutual
undertakings, and a they have branched out and joined hands by districts
and count and states the effectiveness of their organization has in
creased. This t'nvcnti'rti i preparing measures for the betterment of the
industry.- Snrns of them will be submitted to the state legislature; others
will h urgrd on th" national congress; still oUiers will require co-operative
effort on th ? part of members and litizns. We hope, for the take of
" ' i."- -;t:i , that since w! ultci.cl the i-onventiii
its effr.rM to ui't.Hvte tln ,ro!.!tm? with wiikli it is confronted.

NEW YORK. Feb. 13 Stocks were

demonstrating the unwieldy or over
extended condition of that account.
Rails, while strong for the most part,
were the only exceptions to the gen
eral trend, reacting in the last hour
on announcement of receivership pro
ceedings against the New Haven road.
Aside from the tenor cf advices over
the holiday, which testified to a more
hopeful outlook, respecting general
trade there were no specific develop
ments to explain the market's change
in speculative sentiment.
The rise in oils which featured the
session through was attended by re
ports indicating further clarifcation
of the. much involved Mexican situa
tion. Next to rails, in which gains of
two to live noints were larr-fK- hoM
