gram says that the governor regrets
having given his approval and has
withdrawn It in view of information
sent him today by Dudley in a strong
protest against the proposed action.
Senator Dudley pointed cfiit hat
the Columbus raid in 191C immediate
ly followed action similar to that pro
posed by the state department and
predicted that any such action would
be followed by the killing of all Amer
icans in the territory controlled by
Francisco Villa.

All interested point out 'that there
are more than 100 Americans and
other foreigners in the territory con
trolled by Villa and many million dol
lars in property," completely at his
mercy, and that Villa has committed
no outrages against foreigners in bis
latest campaign. They fear the result
cf any action that he would consider a
departure from strict neutrality by
the United States! '
OHIO TO TURN DOWN
ANTI-FIGHT MEASURE
COLUMBUS, Ohio, May 27. What,
is considered a test vote in the Ohio
house of representatives today indi
cates that the bill introduced yester
day to give Governor Cox authority to
stop the Willard-Dempsey match at
Toledo. July 4, will fail to pass as an
emergency measure. It must be passed
as such, or it will not become effec
tive for 90 days, too late to hinder
plant for the matrh.
The test came when efforts were
made to call up out of its order for
immediate passage. With a three
fourths vote necessary, 60 voted and
48 against the motion to take it up.
It consequently did not come up.

PEACE MEET SUMMARY
(By the Associated Press.)
Germany's counter proposals to the
peace treaty comprisine a volume of
goodly proportions, are in readiness
for presentation to the peace congress.
No official announcement has been
made of the time when Count von
Brfcckdorff-Rantzau will make Ger
many's final plea for amelioration of
some of the conditions of the treaty
which are declared to be severe for
fulfillment, but the time cannot be ex
pended beyond noon of Thursday
when the limit for reply expires.
Late dispatches from Berlin indi
cate that the German document is to
contain manifold representations and
arguments for a lessening of the sever
ity "of ihe terms, not alone from the
financial and economic standpoints
but also with regard to disarmament,
both on land and sea, but for ihe utiliz
ing the league of nations warcraft and
merchant shipping of the world's na
tion.s. Territorial relinquishments also
are to be argued against.
In anticipation of the possibility
of a declination oh the part of the
"Germans to sign tne peace treaty,
Marshal Foch, the commander in
chief of the allied and associated
j armies, has made a further inspec
tion of the occupied area in the
I west and its general vicinity and
reported hie observation to Min
ister of War Clemenceau. The
landing of American and British
marines at Danzig probably indi
cates that another step to meet
any eventuality has been taken.
The question whether the German
plenipotentiaries will affix their sig
natures to the document is still a moot
one in Germany. -

i Thoughts On
Grand Opera In Bisbee
Our Italian Opera, op Fifty
Year of Europe in Five Nighta
of Bisbee.
To the cold, logician. Grand Opera
may seem merely grotesque exag
geration of feeling, lurid plot, and
melodramic verse, but. to those hap
pier mortals, who have really lived
mid-channel or struggled In the mael
strom and grown strong against Its
currents, or scorched and convalesced
from youth's lava-stream o emotion,
opera gives Just that artistic outlet
to soaring thoughts and seething
emotion as felt by poetic --human-kind
en todo del mundo.
Every soul in the world yearns and
strives for utterance, and, as Oscar
YVilde says In his -De Profundis," we
are In our longing for self-expression,
like the trees in the prison-yard, all
grimed with soot, yet struggling forth
toward joyous spring vestments of
tender green.
ah opera nice "Kigoietto" may,
however, be felt sympathetically, yet
not not easily understood in case one
has no historical data to help the in
terpretation. It's composer, the im
mortal Guiseppe Verdi, had a life
of the usual fateful ingredients, for
tune mixed with misfortune, joy with
grief. According to one of his com
mentators, the distinguished Boston
teacher and lecturer, Ollin Downes,
he married the daughter of Signor
liareazi, an appreciative patron of
erdl'e genius. "The union was hap
py," Bays the biographer, "but trag
eay was stalking the composer.'
erdi had scarcely begun, the com
position of a comic opera, when a di
sease which the physicians could not
name, carried off. first his wife and
then his two children.
The blow affected profoundly both
the man and his music. All the
succeeding operas of Verdi, until he
reached his eightieth year, were of a
serious and tragical character. For
the moment the heart of the master
failed him. But he had MIS life to
live, his WORK to do. and his genius
drove him on. Love of country, it
not of life, was strong within him.
Italy was fighting for her life as a
nation and it was for Verdi with his
music as for Garabaldl with his arms,
to set that spirit free.
Verdi's name became eventually so
bound up with the liberation of Italy
that the Italians said the very letters
of it each stood for something ot
profound significance to Italy.
(V)ictor (E)mmanuel (R)ey (D)el
(I)talla.
flis libretto for I. Lombard! did nptj
openly expose Italy's wrongs,' but it
had verses' susceptible of patriotic
interpretation and even the presence
of the police could not silence the tu
multuous demonstration of the au
dience when the chorus began the
broad and stately hymn to Liberty,
opening with the words, "Oh, God ot
ALL Nations." This Pilgrim's cho
rus from I. Lombard! shows us in
what a simple and eloquent way Ver
di, was able, even so early In his ca
reer, to stir the emotions of his coun
trymen.
"Rigoletto," like "ErnanI," was in
spired by a -drama of Victor Hugo,
Le Rols'amuse." This astonishing
opera, produced In Venice, March 11,
1851, la far ahead of its period. Even
today, there are pages which surprise
one by their modern feeling and at
mosphere. Mark the opening solo of
the Duke of Martua. Surrounded by
his brilliant court, this tyrant and
libertine sinfs of his conquests. The
song, "Questa o quella" (Searching
Amongst the Fair Throng) reveals
bis cynical and capricious heart.
"Rigoletto", .'the hunch-backed buf
foon of the court, insults Mon
terone a nobleman whom the Duke
has wronged, and Monterone terrible
in his wrath, curses the jester. This
curse Is soon a-warking.
; Rigoletto loves but one being in
the world, bis , daughter, Gilda,
(Jeel-dah). The Duke secretly woos
er disguised as a student. Alone in
er garden, Gilda Blngs one of the
most famous of Verdi's melodies.
"Dearest Name" (Caro Nome), she
murmers. i thinking of her lover,
'Name of One Whom I Adore." The
melody is in the old-fashioned style
of Rossini, a simple air with elabo
rate musical ornaments. It is worthy
pf especial consideration however,
because it not only, displays the skill
of the singer, but also lays hare the
.innocent .nature fit Gilda, an. inexpe
rienced Idolatrous girls, singing hap
pily of her lover.
I shall make songs and give them to
the breeze.
And die amid a thousand ecstacies.
I shall be dust, and feel the joyous
sting
Of that sweet arrow from the bow of
Whfch men call Spring.
And out of my dead mouth a rose
shall come like rime.
The end of this song is well known
in soprano literature because of the
fcigh E.
In the next the courtiers plot to
befool Rigoletto. They pretend to
play a game in which he mast be
blindfolded. In this way they suc
ceed in stealing his daughter and de
liver her to the Duke of Mantua.
One of the greatest passages of the
opera comes in the third act when,
Rigoletto enters the ducal anteroom.
trying vainly to conceal his dismay,
under a laughing exterior, (in bis
the Italian
"La! La! La!" song), while his eyes
search everywhere for a Bign of his
missing child. At" last, unable longer
to dissemble, he implores the cour
tiers, who Jeer at his misery, to have
mercy, to speak. They whisper
among themselves, but give no reply.
Desperate, at his wit's end. forgetful
at last, of caution and fhe flattery due
his masters, the poor misshapen jest
er with a cry of rage, denounces the
rabble, who have so cruelly humili
ated him and, in sheer unfeelingness,
are breaking his heart. "Vile race of
courtiers," he anathematizes them,
a good song for many places and all
time.
The courtiers leave, discomfited, as
Gilda entering throws herself into
her father's arms and confesses all,
even her pitiable love for the Duke,
a bewitchment over her still in spite
of his Napoleonic violences.
The last act of the opera, which
contains the immortal quartet, takes
place in a lonely spot on the shores
of the river Mincio. On one side is
seen the hut of the assassin, Spara
fucile. With this man " Rigaletto has
struck a terrible bargain. Through
the sister of Sparafucile, the wanton
Maddalena, the Duke is to be lured
to the hut and there murdered. His
body to be delivered to Rigoletto,
who will wait outside at midnight. -
Gilda, loving her betrayer, im
plores her father to reconsider his
projected crime. For answer he bids
her approach .the hut, where Gilda
sees the Duke.. fickle, dallying amor
ous, coquetting with the vulgar and
unscrupulous Maddalena.
Such is the situation when the
Duke sings his aria, beloved of all
tenors, "La donna e mobile" (Wom
an is fickle).
This aria was not shown to the
tenor Mirate until a few hours be
fore the premiere. Verdi then gave
him the music, commanding him not
to sing, ' whistle or think the melody
outside the theatre. The composer
exacted similar promises of orches
tra, chorus, and every one present at
rehearsal.
The reception of the air proved his
wisdom in taking these precautions.
The house burst into applause before
th tenor had finished the first verse,
and, when the audience filed fronj the
theatre, "La Donna e Mobile" could
be heard whistled and sung through
out Venice.
There are few ensemble passages
in all opera which equal the succeed-!
ing quartette in beauty and dramatic
power. Here are four people each an-J
lmated by a different emotion, each
part strongly individual, and all the'
Voices combining to make a heaven-1
ly harmony. Gilda'is desperate with
the discovery of the Duke's infidel
ity. The Duke, meanwhile, is casting
languishing eyes on Maddalena. Mad
dalena is laughing in his arms, and
Rigoletto, crouching outside the door
of the hut, is plotting vengeance.
Here we have a musical and one
might say comical picture of Life it
self. A perfect art or philosophy or
even perfect world itself, would in
evitably fall pall upon our appetite.
Music and life both require disso
nance to relieve the accordances, or
as the Cardinal in John Inglesant ob
serves, "I have heard, you, too,
doubltless. In a convert of viols ex-i
temporary descant upon a thorough!
bass in the Italian manner, . when
each person in turn plays such a va-,
riety of descant, in concordance to
the bass, as his skill and the present
invention may suggest to him. In'
this manner of play, the consonances'
invariably fall' true upon a given;
note, and every succeeding note ofi
the ground is met, now in the unison'
or octave, now In the concords, pre
serving the melody throughout by the
laVs of motion and of sound. I have'
thought that this Is life." I
To a solemn bass of mystery and
of the unseen, each man plays his
own descant, as his taste and fate
suggest; but this manner of play is
so. governed and -controlled by what
seems a fatal necessity, that all melts
into a species of harmony; and even
the very discords and dissonances,
the wild passions and deeds of men,
are so attempered and adjusted that
without them the entire piece would
be incomplete."
In this way we may see in the Ital
ian opera the same spectacle as in
life, or the mirror of Nature. ; ; ' ,
A storm rages; the hour of, mid
night strikes,, , A. body, enclosed In a1
sack is . thrown through the door.
Rigoletto is exulting in his veng
eance when he hears what seems to
him a ghostly echo, the careless song
of the Duke, "La Donna e Mobile."
He opens the sack and beholds the
face of his own daughter. Gilda has
offered her life to save the man who
betrayed her. "The curse." he
shrieks, and the curtain falls.
The philosophy of Rigoletto is ex
cessively morbid. consistently j
enough, though, since all the action
centers t around Rigoletto, a defec-j
tive, one might almost say a degen
erate from birth. As Mr. Frank Har
ris has so recently reminded us, and
thoroughly proven aTnd illustrated in
his masterly study of "The Man

mortals. The early disaster in Ver
di's home actually unbalanced .his
mind for half a century, so great was
the shock to his love-nature and the
outrage of his sense of justice. The
very depths and heights of his genius
made this reaction all the more pro
found and lasting. In the portrayal
of Rigoletto, he implies conception,
so violated as he thinks, by realities,
that the play becomes a wild orgy
of pure diablere, a something as. trag
ically perverse as the irresponsible
pranks of Frankenstein, the sinister
working .of not only a Duque but a
whole universe without a soul.
The orcnestra Monday night gave
a splendid and nobly sympathetic ac
companiment to this Aristophanic
irony. The chorus was ' virile, con
centrated, intense and 'unmatched 'by1
anything we' have- yet heard in Bis
bee. On a miniature scale, their
work compares well with organiza
tions like the Ellis and Orpheum
clubs of Los Angeles. Their acting
had the dignity of straightforward
simplicity and seemingly unstudied
grace. The voices were robusto, con
mucho brio, yet agreeably refined.
The attack and tempos of both orches
tra and chorus were unusually strong
and well sustained.
Eugenia' Ramirez was admirably
cast for the part of the courtesan,
Maddalena, and gave just the right
emphasis to the coarse, gutteral
words. ' She is to be congratulated on
not having overacted the part, so eas
ily done to the point of offense. Tina
Paggi, as Gilda, was ever new delight
as she had been in her amazingly
beautiful "Lucia." In the "Caro
Nome" her exquisite tones floated
forth like an unbodied joy whose race
is just begun.
"All the earth and air with her voice
' was loud, "
As when night 1b bare, from some
lonely ' cloud
The moon rains forth her' beams '
And Heaven is overflowed '
Her highly spiritualized voice and
character made her ideally fitted to
such a part, angellically free from
jealousy or envy and sublimely self-j
immolating. '
The 'young Duke, with his God-like
gifts of youth, high-spirits and a di-
vine tenor, captivated every one.
His personality was an impersona-

SCORES TRIUMPHS
IN DUAL OFFERING
The Italian Grand Opera company
in Paggliacci and Cavalleria Rusticana
last night swept its audience in a
wave of melody from the throats of
songsters and nightingales that fairly
vibrated the Grand theater in a spark

ance. Beatriz Pizzorni and Eugenia
Ramirez shared the : honors of the
evening, the" former in the role of
Nedda in Paggliacci and the latter as
Santuzza In Cavellia Rusticana. It
was a highly pleasing'attraction from
beginning to end "with a display of
talent in its best form, well rendered
even, to the- most difficult parts. Piz
zorno established herself in the
hearts of her audience as a wonderful
actress with a wide vocal range that
was charming and penetrating, some
times soft and sweet and low and then
suddenly bursting into huge volume
attesting wonderful training,
Eduardo Lejarazu, the baritone, as
Tonio the Jeter in Pagliacci, brought
out the range of hfs voice to its best
and he was well received. He showed
beyond doubt his skill and ability in
the profession 'which he has chosen.
Alfredo firariani as Turiddu in Ca-
j valleria Rusticana exhibited his work
to better advantage that he did in the
roie of Canio in Pagliacci. His rich,
iow tones and careful blendine of notes
placed him as one of the foremost
characters in the play in a very dif
ficult role to assume.
Tonight the company will be seen
in La Bohemaan opera In four acts,

Why not you?
BY JUNE ELVIDGE
The Most Proposed-To Woman In the
World
The society lover is perhaps the
least satisfactory of all the types of
men who seek the love of woman.
Blase, and more or less world
weary, even the younger set of so
ciety men take the marriage game
much for granted. It is a . game to
resort to when one has finished most
other interesting things in life.
The zest of love-making has as
often as not been lost in the pursuit of
many other women, before the society
man decides it is time . to "settle
down" and "get himself a wife."
There are plenty of exceptions, of
course, but the girl who is in the
"social whirl" and must pick her life
partner from a restricted circle of
wealth and fashion is less likely to se
cure a satisfactory lover and husband
than the girl in humbler circum
stances. ' '
Making love for the fun of ' the
game has usually become a fine art
to the society' man.- What he has to
offer the girl whom he fineJly decides
to honor is little indeed.

I have never recommended a stock before I invsti-
gated it -thoroughly. .
Since taking over the EL PASO OIL EXCHANGE
at 206 No. Oregon Street, I have followed out this
policy of protecting the 'public,' and 'jvheitT ' reepm
mend a stock, you can "Bet your. bottom dollar"
that it is a WINNER. : " r; ;-
At this time it is my HONEST OPINION that the
one "BEST BET" on the maiket v is' ; "SILVER
CYCLE," which promises to be one; of , the act jye
Burkburnett stocks. - .
SILVER CYCLE adjoins the -GOLDEN CYCLE
and is 200 yards from UNITED OIL. It is in
BLOCK 75 and one half mile from the BURK
WAGdONER. Its an INTERESTING FACT to. note that all the
stocks o.f the companies v surrounding SILVER
CYCLE are selling from $1 0.00 to above $3,000.00
per share. ' :. -
If you want to get in on SILVER CYCLE, you will
have to ACT QUICKLY; the safest way is to WIRE
your order direct to me. Any '. moment now you
may see SILVER CYCLE OVERSUBSCRIBED.

The American Legion
A national convention of American soldiers and sailors in which
no grievances were aired, no political axes ground, no special privileges
or preferments demanded; where oratorical "bunk" was 'hooted down;
where social discrimination.. was taboo and military rank counted not at
all; where the past glories of war were subordinated to the future glories
of peace, and where the national interest was placed above all partisan
ship that is something new under the sun. It was in such a conven
tion, held in St. Louis during the Becond week in May, that the new
spirit of the American army and navy expressed itself articulately for the
first time since the armistice was signed. The birth of the American
Legion was attended by circumstances having a significance comparable
with those surrounding the signing of a certain document in Philadelphia
one hundred and forty-three years ago come July 4:
A brigadier general arises To "place in nomination the name of a
man who " and is cried down by doughboys with calls of "Name him!
Who is he?" A proposal to give extra pay to enlisted men is unanimously
defeated because, as Lieutenant Colonel Roosevelt put it, "we are not
here to sandbag something out of the government, but to put something
into it." The invitation to make Chicago the next meeting place of the
legion is refused because "American soldiers and sailors don't want
to go to a city whose mayor would be ashamed to welcome such a con
vention." A progressive republican, son of a famous father, refuses the
chairmanship to quiet suspicion of personal ambition, and the office goes
to a southern democrat of whose party the gathering is in complete
ignorance.
One of the convention tsenographers Baid: "Tli,is is the funniest
convention I have ever attended." We have an idea that there was an
elemeht of prophecy in her homely remark a body representing more
than four million American soldiers and sailors that, makes so little
political noise is likely to be about as funny to the conventionally minded
politician as a bqmbardment of gas shells. This language of "restraint in
the mouths of organized civilian youth may prove to be a natural com-
panion to the famous battle slogan of the A. E. F.: "Let's go!" Collier's
Weekly. . -

On Being Nice
A magnificent liod one time' met a little mouse whose home was
being attacked by a wild cat. The lion immediately chased the cat into
the offing and protected the mother mouse until her brood could be
moved to a safe hiding place.
Some time later the lion became caught in a net and would have
perished had not the little mouse happened, along and gnawed the ropes
in two, releasing the lion." ' .
A fable, yet one that possesses a mighty lesson for all of us.

was rendered today in the case of
Bertha Smith, self-styled "Bride
Elect," against whom a charge of in
sanity was brought recently by Dr.
Aylmer Harding, who said that hla
wife and other people had been de

DENY BUSINESS PERMIT
PHOENIX, May 27 The application
of the Security Savings & Loan ass-,
elation of Nevada for a permit and
license to do business in Arizona was
denied by the corporation commission
in an order issued today.
Although the applicant in its peti
tion states that it has an authorized
capitalization of $250,000, of wrich
$77,000 has been subscribed and fully
paid, and that it intends to operate
asa.' savings and loan corporation, or
ganized for the purnose of accumulat
ing and collecting the funds of its
members, stockholders and depositors,
and i in investing and in loaning the
same , fox; periods not exceeding 10
years, nor exceeding $10,000 in amount
to any one persoa or corporation, upon
first mortgage security .the corpora
tion commission believed that the
sphere of the business of the appli
cant savings and loan association
would come under the law dealing
with "Home co-operative companies
and like corporations." The latter
measure was adopted by the state leg
islature to meet a serious condition
that confronted the state through the
activities of foreign corporations sell
ing certificates, the consequence of
which was that a great deal of money
was taken out of the state, and when
the companies securing the same
failed in their obligations serious
losses were' Sustained by the subscrib
ers. Under the "home co-operative"
law a deposit in cash value of $50,000
as security was required of all foreign
corporations engaged in this business.

VENUS AND JUPITER
IN CONJUNCTION ARE
BRILLIANT SPECTACLE
Beautiful and spectacular was the
sight when Venus and Jupiter were
in conjunction Sunday evening. These
two planets are on these moonless
nights, the two brightest objects in
the evening sky. They are rapidly ap
proaching each other and at the end
of this week will be only two degrees
apart. .
Venus, is three times as bright as
Juniter, but Jupiter is far brighter
than any of the first magnitude stars,
of which several are above the hori
zon, namely Sirius, Procyon, Capella,
Arcturus and Regulus. The latte'r is
near the planet Saturn now shinning
in the eastern sky. Venus is the
brightest for two reasons it i3 the
nearest being only about 40,000,000
miles away, and is enveloped in a
thick mantle of vapor-laden atmos
phere which brilliantly reflects the
light of the sun.
In a telescope of moderate power it
now presents the phase of a beautiful
crescent which will grow thinner and
thinner till it finally disappears. Its
orbit lies inside that of the earth, the
two orbits being 20,000,000 miles
apart. When i reaches a point be1
tween the earth and sun only the
dark side will be presented and it
will entirely - disappear from view.
After that it will become a morning
star and pass through reverse phases.
Though Venus excels in brightness
Jupiter is enormously greater in act
ual magnitude. Jt is 1315 times larger
than the earth, but is more than 400,
000,000 miles distant 10 times the
distance of Venus.
A total eclipse of the sun will oc
cur on May 29, though not visible
from this district a few facts relative
to the phenomenon will be of interest
to residents of this district.
In Brazil, Liberia and the Congo,
the phenomenon will be visible The
obscuration will last for seven min
utes in those countries the longest
period of any of the total eclipses that
have come in the past quarter cen
tury. On account of Brazil, Liberia and
Congo being west of the one hundred
and eightieth meridan, what there is
to see of the eclipse, due two weeks
hence, will in this section of the
co intry come on May 28 instead of
May 29.
On September 21. 1922, there will
be a total eclipse to pass overWest
Australia and Queensland and on Sep
tember 10, 1923 .there will be another
over Lower California and Mexico.
The next total eclipse in the United
States will be on January 24, 1925,
covering a section of territory be
tween Duluth, Minn., and New Haven,
Conn.

VALESKA SURATT
HEADS BILL AT
EAGLE THEATER
Valeska Suratt will be seen at the
Eagle theater for the last time today
in "The Soul of Broadway," a William
Fox play, dealing with the night life of
New 'York, especially the life on
Broadway. The play is said to contain
some very sensational scenes, calcu
lated to startle all who see them. A
page has been torn from that book of
life which only Broadway knows, and
has been transferred to the screen
with all its realism.
The story is that of a Broadway ad
venturess, who plays with men aw .
cat toys with a mouse. Money is her
god, and she must always have it in
plenty to be happy. If one man can
not give it to her, another must. In
this way she makes a wreck out of a
banker, who is madly infatuated with
her. He steals from the bank of which
he is president, calls on the woman,
and when she attempts to shoot him
he is arrested for attempted murder.
His defalcations are known, and he
goes to prison for five years. He
comes out old and gray, and his meet
ing with the woman who sent him to
prison, as well as the sequel of this
meeting, is most dramatic and sensa
tional. Adv.

(MISUNDERSTANDINGS
AS TO PAYMENT OF
TAX ON MFT DRINKS
Inquiries received by the Review
indicate a misunderstanding on the
part of not oniy a large portion of the
public, but dealers themselves regard
ing the tax on soft drinks, which be
came effective May 1. Reports
reaching the Review are that some
dealers are not collecting the tax
while others are charging extra pen
nies for drinks which are not taxable.
To correct these mistakes, the bu
reau of internal revenue has issued
the following official statement relat
ing to ;the collection of 'the tax: j ,
. The : tax is . one ? cent . for each ten
cents : or fraction thereof on the'
amount paid at soda . fountains, ice
cream parlors or similar places of bus
iness' on' soft drinks, -ice cream sun
daes, "or similar articles of food or
drink when sold for consumption in or
in proximity to such place of busi
ness." The purchaser can not escape
the tax by stepping outsider of the
place where sold to consume his soft
drink or ice cream. Ice cream in
cones is taxable, because sold under
conditions which indicate that it is to
be consumed "in pr in proximity to
the place of business." When ice
cream is sold under conditions which
indicate that it would usually be con
sumed in or in proximity to the prem
ises, the fact that the purchaser does
not consume it there but carries it
way, does not render it free from the
tax. Ice cream sold in boxes and icej
cream sodas or other soft drinks sold
in pitchers or buckets for home con
sumption are exempt.
Bales of soft drinks, ice cream and
similar articles of food and drink in
hotels, restaurants, cafeterias and
club houses are Hot taxable unless
sold separate and apart from meals. If
ice cream or a soft drink is the only
refreshment ordered in such places
the tax applies. Such sales at soda
fountains are taxable even though sold
as part of a meal.
In general such', beverages common
ly known as soft drinks which are
compounded or mixed at a soda foun
tain are subject to the tax. .Illustra
tive of these are orangeade lemonade,
pineapple juice, coca cola, root beer,
moxie, phosphates, fruit and flavoring
syrups mixed with plain or carbonated
water, milk shakes, malted milk
shakes, cream and egg - shakes, jce
cream, ice cream sodas, ice cream
sundaes, ice cream sandwiches and
flavored ices.
Certain drinks often sold at soda
fountains, ice cream parlors and simi
lar places of business are not taxable.
Such beverages are hot beef tea, cof
fee, tea, buttermilk, milk, hot choco-:
late or cocoa, hot clam bisque, hot
tomato bisque, and hot tomato bouil
lon. Medicinal preparations such as
bromo-seltzer, citrate of magnesia,
rochelle salts, seitlets powders, bi
carbonate of soda, aromatic spirits of
ammonia, epsom salts, essence of pep-

Our Mr. McCollum has just received a letter from O. C. Weatherby of Goldthwaite,
Mills County, Texas: Goldthwaite, Texas, May 24, 1 9 1 9.
Mr. R. M. McCollum,
Lowell, Arizona.
Dear Bob:
I feel it my duty to inform you of the development that has
taken place in the last few days in Mills County, knowing that you
and others are going to drill a well in this county the Forster well
finding oil at the depth of '2530 feet, at this time is standing several
hundred feet in oil and leases and royalty has gone sky high, all indi
cations are that we are going to have an oil field in this county, in fact
we are almost assured of one.
The location where you are to drill is also well known in this
part of the country and all are anxious to see you start to work.
The Clarion well on the Weston Ranch is making preparation to
shoot their well, and is believed by all who have had any experience
in the oil business that it will make a good well.
The Fidelity well on the Young Ranch, in the western part of the
county, are drilling in the Black Lime at the depth of 1 800 feet and
have a considerable gas pressure, and is being closely watched as well
as the other wells.
There are a number of other wells that are drilling, all with
favorable reports in the western and southern parts of the county.
Trust that you will soon be prepared to begin your well and meet
the expectation of the people.
Yours very truly,
v -v ,, ByO. C. WEATHERBY.

sin, etc., sold at the fountain also es
cape the "soft drink" tax. No tax ap
plies on the sale ot beverages such as
ginger ale, root beer, moxie, mineral
water, ate, when served from closed
containers, because a manufacturer's
tax on such drinks has already been
leived.
The tax is on the whole amount ot
the purchase price. Thus, if a pur
chaser who "treats" a friend orders
two sodas at the same time, each
selling for 15 cents, the tax is 3 cents,
and not 4 cents. If, however, he buys
one 15 cent soda and immediately
thereafter purchases another 15 cent
drink, the tax is 2 cents on each sale.
Dealers are advised to guard separate
customers against pooling their pur
chases to escape the tax. The penalty
for willfully attempting to evade the
tax i3 a fine of not more than $10,000
or not more than, one year's imprison
ment, or both, together. with-the cost
of prosecution; , ' -
Sales of ice cream, and. soft -drinks
by religious, charitable or educational
societies on special occasions such as
church festivals,picnics, etc., are not
taxable. Such sales in stands and
booths at agricultural affairs, racing
parks, public exhibitions, circuses,
shows and similar places are taxable.

SMITHSONIAN SEEKS
ARIZONA OBSERVATORY
HOENlX, May 27. ;Which is th
sunshiniest" mountain top in Arizona?
This is the query the Smithsonian
institute has put to the federal
weather bureau and the bureau has
passed along to E. H. Fletcher,
observer here.
Anxious to have a permanent sta
tion in a sunny clime for the purpose
of obtaining bolometric measurements
of solar radiation, the Smithsonian in
stitute asked the federal weather bu
beau for its help .-and the bureau,
picking Arizona and southern -California
as the sunniest areas in the coun
try, has asked for a report on a moun
tain peake, which will fill the require
ments, according to Fletcher. The ob
server .' said , tonight he would ; start
about June 1 on an exploration trip to
locate. the necessary mountain and in
the meantime' he said he had written
railroad officials and others to be on
the lookout for a hill top which would
fill the bill.
The peake according to specifica
tions, should rise at least 2500 feet
above the lecel plain and should have
a clear atmosphere, the most sunshine
obtainable and be near a railroad ta
supply the permanent observers to be
located there, and give them ready ac
cess to the outside world.

Unusual interest is attached to the
announcement of the cast supporting
Mabel Normand in her newest Gold-
wyn picture, "A Perfect 36," by Tex
Charwate, which comes to the Lyric
theater today.
Not only were the best players ob
tainable requisitioned to add their
fun-makiug to the inimitable talents
of the star, but the presence of one
of them bears a relation to the affec
tions of Mabel Normand never before
found in their associate players.
, The artiste in question is Flora Za
belle,, who, as almost everyone knows,
is Mrs. Raymond Hitchcock in private
life. Although she has appeared but
little in the silent drama, she has been
much a friend to Mabel Normand for
a number of years. . Miss Zabelle ang
her husband have been the guardians
of Mabel Normand, so to speak, and
have advised her in regard to all her
business affairs since they met on the
coast.
For a long time the Goldwyn star
has wished to be aided in her pro
ductions by the beauty and ability of
Flora Zabelle, but not once has there
been a role which, seemed quite suited
to the talents of her friend. Once she
read the scenario of "A Perfect 36"
Mabel Normand exclaimed : "Why,
this is just the part for her if I .can
only persnade her to do It!"-'Whereupon
she brought her well-known
powers of coaxing to bear and before
long had the piquant Zabelle's con
sent. And Mabel Normand was hap
py beyond words.
Their daily work at the Goldwyn
studioB took on the aspect of a joy
ous reunion. The star insisted that
Miss Zabelle share her dressing room
and be with her every moment. And
the latter, genuinely devoted to the
irresistible madcap, was only too glad
to be her confidante, for Mabel Nor-,
mand Is never silent.
The role assumed by Miss Zabelle
has attractions for the accomplished
artiste. It Is a departure from any
thing she has done and there are
many scenes of the two together, each
contributing a different brand of com
edy In the many amusing situations.
Miss Zabelle is cast as Lena, a
woman of mystery, who liveB at a
boarding house where Miss Normand,
in the role of Mabel, is maid of all
work. Adv.
How often has a battery man told
you that you left your switch on or
that your generator has not kept your
battery charged and now the plates
are buckled and you will have to buy a
new battery? You will not get that
kind of treatment with the Philadel
phia, the plates will not buckle even
with a dead short circuit. You can't
help it if you get a short circuit, any
one Is liable to get a short circuit any
time, even on a long trip, and if it
means a new battery every time It
gets to be very expensive.

We would like to call the attention of
the people to the fact that the derrick
for our first well is now being erected
on the Woods tract and drilling will be
pushed as rapidly as possible. This
tract is only a few feet from the Ocean
and Ranger Central leases, with which
the peoplei ' the southwest are thor
oughly familiar.
Just a half mile south of our -Woods
tract is the Poteet well, a half 'mile '
southeast is the Perkins well, and about
five-eighths of a mile, southeast" is the
Allen well. All bf these wells are now
in the black limestone -and showing lota,
of gas aad oil. They are- acting very
much in the same way as -the Norwood
well two miles to the southeast -.which
is the biggest well yet brought in, In the
Central Txfts toil fields. '.-
Mr. H. H. Adams, a noted geologist,
. made the statement that both the Woods
tract and Walker tract were, among the
best locations in the. Ranger field, and
that there was absolutely no doubt as
to our getting big .production on both
tracts.
We urge on the people of the South
west to buy this stock now when they
can get it at par, and have given to
them an option on one and a half times
as much, which option contract is selling
today on the open market for from twen
ty to fifty percent of its face value. This
is the greatest opportunity for profit
ever offered the people of Bisbee.

STOCKS AND BONDS
NEW YORK, May 27. Dealings on
the stock exchange today were again
active and broad, failing only by a
small margin to equal yesterday's two
million share day, which established a
record far over two years.
Frequent periods of uncertainty
marked the session, due mainly to the
approaching . triple . holiday, . but final
quotations disclosed many substantial
gains. Developments of the day bore
little direct relation to market condi
tions, apart from, the , further heavy
expansion of brokers' loans, -which
doubtless accounted for the firmer
money tendencies.
Motors and associated specialties,
also steels and equipments, were once
more the chief elements of specula
tive interest, but rails were more ac
tive and metals made occasional re
sponse to reports of a revival of for
eign demand.
Changes among steels were mostly
nominal. United States Steel retriev
ed only a fraction of its 1 point re
action, but Southern Pacific held at a
substantial advance. Sales,
1,825,000
BUleo-
Victory bonds made their first ap -
pearane'e on the exchange, selling at
$99.88 to $99j6. The Liberty group
held firm while internationals eased
off. Total sales, par value, $13,750,000.

THE GRAIN MARKETS

ed materially in corn owing for the !
most part to meagerness of the sup

September $1.58 to $1.58. Oats!,?

to SOc.
Strength chaiacterized the corn
market throughout the session and
there was a specially urgent call for
the May delivery. Upturns of the May
price, which touched the' highest price
yet for the present crop, had an evi
dent direct bullish influence on the
.later months, although shorts were
.trying their utmost to get corn in time
,to apply on May contracts.
Reports that green bugs were at
tacking the fields in some parts of
Missouri gave independent strength to
the oats market.
Provisions advanced sharply as a re
sult of packers buying of July lard
and ribs. At first, however, weakness
in the hog trade operated as a big
weight on values.
