State Department Publishes a
Letter From German Am
bassador to Mexico Involv
ing Swedish Minister There.
(By Review Leased Wire.)
WASHINGTON. Sept. 13. Another
chapter to the story of German in
trigue in neutral countries and among"
neutral diplomats, was revealed to
night by Secretary Lansing in the
form of a letter to the imperial chan
cellor from the notorious von Eck
hardt, the German minister at Mexico
City, to whom the intercepted Zim
mero.ann note was addressed. It dis
closes that Koike Ci'jnholme, the
Swedish minister ig Mexico, was de
pended upon by the German diplomat
to furnish information "froTi the hos
tile camp" an dto transmit communi
cations to Berlin and that von Eck
hardt wanted him rewarded by a
secret award from the kaiser "of the
order of the crown of the second
c'ass.'
Letter Is Old
This leUer was written March 8.
1916, and apparently has been in the
possession Vf the American govern
ment for a long time. It was made
public without comment, shedding
light upon the methods of another
Swedish diplomatic representative in
this hemisphere at a :ime when the

Cronholme Dismissed
Baron Akerhielm, Swedish charge
here, said tonight in response to a
query that Cronholme was dismissed
from the diplomatic service last Jan
uary. He wou'.d not discuss the cause,
but there was no intimation that it
was in any way connected with Cron
ho;me's relations with the Germans.
Called at Department
Baron Akerhielm called at the state
department during the day to inform
Secretary Lansing that he had receiv
ed front his government the statement
already given to the public at Stock
holm explaining that Sweden had for
warded dispatches from the German
minister at Eueaos Aires ;o Berlin
in German code without knowledge or
tiieir contents. He did not leave a
copy of the statement. It is assumed
that the Stockholm foreign office will
not address any communication to tne
American government on the subject.
The department's translation of the
von Eckl-.ardt !etter fol.'jws:

Kerensky's plan is believed to be
to restore discipline by making f.

have full authority to direct military

by rooting out ill-treatment of sol

ARTILLERY IN
FRENCH CAMP
American Artillerymen Play
War With Heavy Guns and
Ample Ammunition. Men
Learning Last of War Tac
tics. (By Review Leased Wire)
AMERICAN TRAINING CAMP IN
FRANCE, Wednesday. Sept 13 (By
the Associated Press). American
guns are booming in France, booming
under the eyes of observation balloons
with airplanes to trace each 'singing
shrapnel shell, each missile of high
explosive destruetiveness. Thus far
the guns have not been turned against
the enemy, but there is every likeli
hood that the artillery will be at the
front, for it is planned to complete
the intensive training of the gunners
actual battle conditions, under the Tire
of German guns and with their own
weapons directed against occupied
German trenches on the various posi
tions fcehind the enemy lines.
Plans Unknown
While the plans of the American
commanders are unknown, it would
seem logical from a military stand
point that after the American artil
lery has completed weeks of training
at the front in laison with the French
infantry and 'supporting guns, the
greater part of it would be witlw
drawn for maneuvers with the grad
ualy multiplying American infantry.
Training Arrangement
The co-operation of artillery and
infantry is so close under modern bat
tle tactics that it is essential they
should be trained to act together al
most as one unit And just as the
first contingent of American infantry
will devote itself largely through the
fall and winter to training other units
as they arrive, so the first contingent
of artillery will train the batteries,
regiments and brigades which will be
thrown into France before the spring
campaign of 1918 is likely to begin.
French Cease Instruction
Theer are no longer any French of
ficers or poilus actually serving at
the guns, the crews having been
Americanized throughout. At the ob
servation posts and in the schools of
instruction French officers sit now
only in an advisory capacity.
Have Kept Up
Through various reports received
from trained officers, attaches and
other confidential sources during the
last three years, the American artil
lery officers of the regular army have
been enabled to keep in fairly close
touch with all the gunnery develop
ment in the world war sufficiently
close, in any events, to change many
of their older practices within the
last twelve months, while at the same
time keeping them abreast the more
modern theories of the artillery
school. What the American artillery
has now and should have bad before
is plenty of shells.
Plenty of Sheila
It Is easily conceived what this
means to the enthusiastic officers and
men whose batteries are expending
within two or three weeks ten times
the number of shells formerly allothd
to them for an entire year.
Maze of Detail
Modern artillery training is a maze
of details, a labyrinth of mathemat
ical problems, a never-ending series
o fintricate puzzles, in which such
elusive and subtle subjects as orien
tation, triangulation, deflection, drift,
elevation, calibration, meteorology,
range-finding and a dozen other
branches of optics and geometry and
the general application of the concen
trated powers of destruction are in
volved. ,

contract with the Washington gov
ernment the French government has
supplied the American artillery units

which it is generally conced
ed is the finest light field piece the
world has even known. It corresponds
with and takes the place of the old
three-inch gun in the American army.
The French have also supplied the
Americans with six-inch howitzers
a gun of great power and accuracy
which corresponds to the noted Ger
man 5.9, 'probably the most effective
weapon in the entire German gun
list.

however. One of their number, Vaso

"No, Vaso," the sheriff said with a
smile: "but if you aren't there Satur

GREEK MISTER IS

"White Book" Will Soon be
Issued by the Foreign Min
ister of Greece, Showing
Record of a Neutral Nation,
ATHENS, Aug. 15 (By mail). The
minister of foreign affairs, M. PolitisI,
was busy putting the finishing touches
on the White Book, which is to re
veal to the Greek parliament the ex'
tent to which the recent administra
tion of King Constantine was under
German influence, when a staff corre
spondent of the Associated Press
called on hira today.
"This makes a serious record of
perfidy," the minister said on glane
ing over some of the proof sheets of
the White Book.
He spoke in a tone of regret of
these unpleasant revelations, which)
public might be aware to what extent
German influence operated in shaping
the neutral regime of Greece up to
the time of King Constantine's re
cent abdication.
Asked what aspirations Greece was
likely to have in the peace congress,
M. Politisi said:
"There are, of course, the larger
general questions in which the en
tente allies have shown a common in-
and practice in the dealings between
nations.
The minister spoke of the recent
Balkan conference at Paris as highly
satisfactory in its results.

LABOR FOR GERMAN MINES
The Swedish newspapers publish an
outline of a proposal received from
Germany for the use of Swedish labor
in the German coal mines.
The scheme provides for the send
ing of Swedish workmen to the Ger
man rtal mines to dig coal for Swed
ish use. although a percentage of the
coal thus dug must be delivered to
Germany. The Swedish workmen must
bring their food and other necessary
supplies from Sweden, and the coal
must be loaded at Hamburg by Swed-
ish laborers.

Friday Morning, September 14, 1917.
Responsibility for the present wide spread and determ
ined campaign against the German language press of
this country lies with that press itself. Arrogant, false,
treacherous, it fanned the smouldering indignation into
a consuming blaze. Their German language papers were
the worst enemies that German-Americans ever had since
they and their fathers fled from Prussian dominion o!
Germany. This war will mark their waning and their
end, and Germans and those of German parentage in this
country will be the better for it.
A real sensible, practical suggestion, among the mass
of silly and hysterical economics proposed as a result of
the war is this: Eat potatoes this coming winter; make
them take the place of meat to a large extent; fry them
for breakfast, boil them for the noonday meal and bake
them at night. The crop for this year is estimated at
467 millions of bushels. Let's win the war with the
humble but useful spud, the best all round article of food
on the menu and the only one that can pitch for wheat
and catch for meat in the game of life when H. C. of L
goes to bat.
The Tombstone Prospector declares that there was no
censorship of dispatches by any individual, or set of in
individuals, from the warren District on the morning of
July twelve, for a censorship is a perusal and curtailment
of messages, and there were no messages sent at all from
Bisbee that memorable day, and for the reason that the
entire town decided not to let any word get out of the
departure or route of the cattle train special. And the
Prospector is right. It was not a censorship; it was a
public cessation. The entire county decided not to com
municate with the outside world on one certain subject
that a life or death matter. It was a personal matter with
Cochise county and the county stands united on tho
subject.
When the government cut the rations at the Columbus
stockade there was quite a commotion among the patriots
therein assembled. Nothing had been heard from them
for some time. An I. W. W. likes to eat three times a
day and anything that interferes with his rations stirs
his emotions. His existence at the stockade was ideal
until a heartless government took the last of his rights
away. All he had to do there was to eat and to talk. And
these two things are all he wants to do. What a shame
that these por patriots are compelled to call aloud for
food and demand their ease. Of course there is a de
mand everywhere for workers, and these men are husky
and strong. But their red cards are not work cards, and
the principles of their organization forbid them to work
So what can the poor men do? Isn't it too bad? The L
W. W. always plans and generally succeeds in living off
the work of others. Things are breaking badly for him
right now. The workers are not supporting him as they
ought to do, and the government, too, is against h'.ra.
Serbian leaders who have visited the district lately
for the purpose of forming a closer organization
among their countrymen are engaged in a most laud
able work, and it may well bear fruit in due time.
Both effort and patience will be required before the
good results will be seen, however. Serbian workmen
are generally peaceable and industrious and not in
clined to strike propagandas. But they have among
the first to go out in case of strike, and that without
rhyme, rule or reason. They have been easy prey for
any agitator that might visit the district. Hence,
they have been a liability rather than an asset at
times when they were needed the most. Their leaders,
who have been. here rerntly from Washington and San
Francisco, appear to b? patriotic and intelligent men.
T'ley argue that the United States is an ally of Serbia, j
and that at least for the term of the war it is disloyal
for any Serbian to quit work without a real cause. A
close organization undtr forceful and alert leaders may
well protect the Serb workmen from the soapltox ora
tors and propagandists. Such a oue the leaders be
lieve has been organized in this district. It is to be
hoped that this is the case.
HIS REASONS.
Henry Clews, the New York banker and optimist, gives
the following reasons for his cheering viewpoint of na
tional affairs:
These four factors, the revenue bill, price fixing, firmer
money and radicalism in congress, created a scare among
weak holders of margined stocks which professional op
erators used as a means for depressing the stock market.
Security values now are at a point which should at
tract renewed investment buying. It Is true that the
future is still full of uncertainties. Should the war last
another year, as many believe, the present rate of ex
pen d it u res by our government, which has not only its
own operations to finance but those of the Allies, may
act as a further depressing factor. So also may the at
titude of the government toward the railroads and ship
ping interests. , i-VJU'C'
On the other hand there are many encouraging ccndi
tions. Congress may soon adjourn. The country is
sound financially and commercially. We are sure of
the most prosperous year in agriculture that we have
ever experienced. The same is equally true of all the
chief industries. Wages are high and farmers and work
ing men are likely to be free spenders. This means an
active consumptive demand for many lines of merchan
dise. Transportation problems are less acute than a
year ago. New tonnage is being turned out a tremend-
ous rate by Great Britain and the United States and oth
er nations, which means that there will be less difficulty
in transporting food and munitions across the Atlantic
than has been the case in the last six months. As a
result exports will continue right along, notwithstanding
the embargo on food shipments now in force and which
has caused a setback in our foreign trade.
Our railroad problem is also less acute than was the
case a few months ago. Big traffic during the next three
or four months is a practical certainty. For the seven
months ending with July, 106 of the larger railroads, ac
cording to the Interstate Commerce Commission, had
total revenues of $1,230,681,000, an increase of more than
(13S.000.000 from the corresponding revenues of 191tf.
Their net revenue during the same period was $365,000,
000, compared with $360,000,000 a year ago. Better re
sults should appear during the closing months of the
year,, as traffic is heavier. Some concessions have been
made to the roads and net returns should corresponding
ly Improve, especially as the shotrage in cars is being
largely compensated for by co-operation between the rail
roads. The break in New Haven and New York Central
caused some unsettlement, and was attributed to the dif
ficulties of new financing developed by conditions refer
red to above.
The campaign for the distribution of the second war
loan soon will begin. There is reason to believe that a
higher rate of interest, which is to be authorized by the
War Loan bill now before the House of Representatives,
will be available. As en offset, the new bonds will be
subject to the surtaxes upon large incomes, but not to
the basic income tax or to national, state or local taxes,
except those on inheritances, etc. During the course of
the campaign it is not improbable that every legitimate
effort will be exerted by all patriotic financial interests
to induce a cheerful and sustained position in general
investment circles.
Rippling Rhymes
(By WALT MASON.)
THE NEW STAR OF THE WEST.
THE AMERICAN MELTING POT.
In these days when tihe government is calling our men
to the defense of the flag, it is interesting to know that
about 41 per cent of our adult males over age 20 are for
eign born, or, native born of foreign parents.
The last census shows that of these adult males
24 per cent are foreign born whites.
17 per cent are native whites of foreign parentage.
49 per cent are native whites of native parentage.
10 per cent negroes, Indians and Orientals.
Few people appreciate the real magnitude of the
American problem of race assimilation.
Of the general contents of the "melting pot" (both hex
es all ages) the census shows that 35 per cent or our
population was foreign born and native born with one cr
both parents foreign. The ration is doubtless now about
40 per cent. And if the grand children of the immi
grants were included as "foreign stock" still in the as
similation period, a fair estimate would give us now closj
to 55,000,000 people of foreign stock in continental United
States.
When we look at these amazing figures and realize
that aside from our schools these foreign people have
been virtually left to shift for themselves in the long
and difficult process of thorough Americanization, we
surely have reason to rejoice at their wonderful adapta
bility, and the bright promise they offer for the future.
But the results would be still more marvelous if a sys
tematic and permanent ecort were made to speed the
melting pot process.
And this could be done by discouraging the use of for
eign tongues, and foreign language periodicals, by induc
ing them to abandon the Jiabit of concentrating in race
groups and sticking to alien customs and habits of living
in fact by teaching them how to become good Ameri
cans. Our entrance into the great war. the adoption of the
selective draft for the army, and other Influences now -it
work are bound to give a stimulus 'to the assimilation
process.
More vigor should be put in the stirring of the melt in,;
pot to accelerate the fusing process. The patriotic tires
beneath it n'lould be kept burning with ever increasing
power.
OLD AND NEW
in oliien times tlie hardy knight
went for h with lance and mace to
fight, lie l'jde upon his foaming steeM.
And in the fray it often chanced that
he was shot or slugged or lanced, and
he would lie upon t lie field, encum
bered by his arms and shield, and die
for weary days on end, without a sur
geon or a friend. Oh, dying was a
painful s'.unt for old time soldiers at
the front. But when the modern sol
dier falls, s'ruck d'jwnby shrapnel,
shells or balls, he wakes up if he
hadn't died with Red Cross nurses at
his side. They tend his hurts and
soothe his pain, and make him think
of home again: sweet sympathy is in
their eyes; they are so gentle, patient,
wise, the stricken soldier pities those
who are not shot up by the foes. War
is the most atrocious thing e'er sprung
by an ambitious king, and it vVould be
so much the worse, but for the gentle
Red Cross nurse, who strokes the sick
boy's tangled hair, and brings him
hope who knew despair.

"Officers are to be inns: punctilious

iff Wheeler and will be sent out on the
evening of the 19th at 5:25 o'clock.
It was the intention of the local board
to give Douglas a chance to enter
tain this second quota, but the circus
being in Douglas on that date made
it impossible for the E. P. & S. W.
to handle the train in the yards there
that date, so that it was changed to
Bisbee, while Douglas will be given
the chance to take care of the boys
on October 3. In the list below are
the names of ten alternates, being the
last ten names on the list. Should
any of those listed above those num
bers fail to answer roll call the board
can substitute the alternates, and in
the event that all of the alternates
are called any other person who has
been certified can step into the ranks,
provided he has so declared himself
to the board on the morning of the
ISth at the time of the first roll call.
So that there is a chance for gome
who have just been examined to get

LEMONS BRING OUT
THE HIDDEN BEAUTY
Make this lotion for very little
ccst and Juit see
, for yourself.
v iiat girl or woman nasnl' heard
of lemon juice to remove complexion
JJemi.shes; to bleach the skin and to
tTring out the roses, the freshness and
the hidden beauty? But lemon juice
alone is acid, therefore irritating, and
should be mixed with Orchard white
this way: Strain through a fine cloth
the juice of two fresh lemons Into a
bottle containing about three ounces
of orchard white, then shake well and
you have a whole quarter pint of skin
and complexion lotion at ab'jut the
cost one usually pays for a small Jar
of ordinary cold cream. Be sure to
strain the lemon Juice so no pulp gets
into the bottle, then this lotion will
remain pure and fresh for months.
When applied daily t th face, neck,
arms and bands it should help to
bleach, clear, smoothen and beautify
the skin.
Any druggist will supply three
ounces of orchard white at very lit
t'.e cost and the grocer has the lemons.

MIXEOLA, N. Y Sept. 13. Colonel
Theodore Roosevelt gained the distinc
tion of being the first civilian to make
a flight in an airplane propelled by the
new military m'jtor invented for use
of the government in the war. ' The
flight was made from the Hampstead
aviation field, and for a half hour the
machine, piloted by H. J. Blakely, an
army instructor, attained a 'speed
varying from ninety to 110 miles,
reaching an altitude of 5,000 feet.
Flew With Hoxie
The colonel arrived at the aviation
field just as Blakely was "utning up"
the "Liberty" m'otor for a test flight,
and he immediately asked to be per
mitted to accompany tne instructor.
Blakely informed Colonel Roosevelt
that he had not had an opportunity
to make a trial flight in the new ma
chine and advised him to wait until j
he had taken one trip and then uui

Today, in the countless thousands of homes where gas fired water heaters are in

NEW YORK FINANCIAL
NEW YORK. Sept. 13. Pressure on
the stock market was less severe to
day, but the tendency was still down
ward. The principal opposing influ
ence consisted of the requirements of
the shorts, which led to buying on
the breaks In sufficient volume to
bring about temporary reactions, and
the movement as a whole was Irreg
ular. Total sales, 690.000 shares.
Liquidation of investment stocks
Involved several issues which hith
erto have not been conspicuous in
this connection, but at present pace
levels holders were less inclined to
press them on the market. There was
enough of this selling, however, to
clisjck any tendency toward sustained
improvement. St. Paul, which sold
down to 58: Reading. Northwestern.
Lehigh Valley, Canadian Pacific, Nor
folk and Western and Baltimore and
Ohio showed signs of pressure at
times.
That the decline was not carried
further probably was due to the large
extension of the short Interest re
cently. Shipping shares were sold on news
of the reported loss of the steamship
Minnehaha, and broke sharply.
The market fof roubles showed
greater steadiness.
The bond market was again heavy.

GRAIN MARKET
CHICAGO, Sept 13. Corn prices
ran upward today, influenced mainly
bv unwelcome rains in Iowa and a
forecast' of unsettled weather for the
greater portion of the rest of the corn
belt. The market closed strong. 2 to
2 net higher at 1.19 to 1.20 De
cember, and 1.17 to 1.17 May. Oats
gained 1 to 1 and provisions 12 to
40c.
As dry, warm weather Is needed if
the corn crop is to mature ahead of
killing frost, the ascent of values in
the corn pit required but little time to
get started. Many of the longs who
sold out their corn yesterday were
busy replacing it today.
Fears that threshing and shipping
would be delayed by wet weather
gave decided strength to oats.
Owing to scantiness of arrivals,
wheat could not be supplied In
amounts equal to the wants of the mil
lers. A shortage but no famine In
flour is in prospect, according to a
prominent expert here. He predicted
that wheat receipts at all primary
markets would soon increase from day
to day.
Provisions reflected the advance of
corn. Government buying was almost
continuously in evidence.
NEW YORK. Sept. 13. While the
market at intervals displayed weak
ness, especially in some of the so
rolled high-grade rails, it was rather
apparent, judging by the ease with
which the market recovered. It seems
to be in a well liquidated state, and
if aided by the slightest Intimations
of constructive developments a sharp
advance may tak;e place. The strength
of Russian roubles today and the ad
mission by Berlin of more stubborn
resistance on the Riga front encour
aged the conviction that things gen
erally in Russia are gradually Improv
ing. The technical foundation of the
market is no doubt sounded than for
some time past, and in vew of the
recent severe decline in values in all
issues it is reasonable to expect some
Improvement from this level.

THE LAST STEIN
"The last stein of real beer" has
been given a pathetic seud-off in
Munich, the city of the fam'jus Rath
skellers. According to the Munich
Neueste Nachrichten, it was on a Sun
day evening when the last barrel had
to be broached at the palatial oeei
taverns. Mine host announced to his
customers that this was going to be
the last real pint at the old price, as
the next day only small beer was to
be served which would be dearer in
price.
"It was a sad moment, and heavy
were Our hearts," says the Nachrich
ten, "when the last stein was lifted
on high and drunk in silence."
Brewery prospects are not bright,
as it is announced that for next fall
a much smaller supply of barley will
be available.

FIGHT COSTS TEN
T
American and Spaniard In
Tangle to Discomfiture of
BMci Participants.
II. C. Maddux, an American, and
Benito Quintos, a Spaniard, engaged in
a fight yesterday which cost the for
mer $10 and the latter his vision
at least temporarily. Later, both men
seemed willing to discuss the affair,
although ther stories differed widely.
Quintos. it seems, owns a hous
in Lowell which he rented to Mad
dux on the 9th. An arrangement bad
been made whereby the latter was to
pay a portion of this rent down and
the remainder on the 21st. Maddux
then sub-rented some of the rooms
of the house: and Quintos, anxious to
leave town, asked for a complete pay
ment. Words followed, and then the
fight Quintos says that he was at
tacked from behind in his room, and
that be had no chance to defend him
self. Both of his eyes were partly
closed and the upper cheek was bad
ly puffed and cut. The only statement
Maddux made was that, although a
peaceful man, when he engaged in a
mix-up he preferred to come out on
tcp. Even Quintos admits that he got
his wish yesterday.
S. N. Kemp, who for fourteen years
was the proprietor of tne Arizona
Range News, published at Willcox.
this county, Jias come out from under

the paper to the man be purchased it
from fourteen years ago. Mr. C. O.
Anderson in returning to the News
devotes m'ore of his salutatory to the
praise of his friend Kemp than be
does to making promises for hlmsen.
Mr. Anderson published a good paper
when he owned the News years ago
and it is expected that he will do so
again.
Willcox has recently shown many
evidences of advtncement ana ii
gress and during the iburteen years
past the population tributary to that
town has many times doubled and
with increasing business of every
kind.
Frivolity will be eliminated at the
university this year in connection
with the reception Df the freshmen,
for it is considered that the times are
too serious to waste moments in
pranks. As a first step, the sopho
more class has decided to permit the
freshmen to enter unshorn of their
hair. The big round-up will be retail
ed as a feature of the first t'ollege
week, however, and the little green
skull caps will be much in evidence
on the freshmen's heeds. The move
ment to eliminate the usual rough
house was started by Dr. von Kleln
Smid and the members of the faculty.
The sophomores agreed readily to see
that the new ruling is kept.
