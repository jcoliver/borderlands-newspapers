Bill Empowering President to "Use Other
Instrumentalities," and Voting $100,
000,000 to Arm Ships, Will Show the
World Whether America Will Fight
For Her Rights.
(By Review leased Wire.)
WASHINGTON, Feb. 26. -President Wilson today
asked congress for authority to use the forces of the
United States to protect American ships and lives against
the German submarine menace, to put the nation in a
state of armed neutrality.
The immediate response was the introduction in
the house of a bill, approved in advance by the President,
empowering him to furnish guns and gunners to Ameri
can merchantmen and to "employ such other instrumen
talities and methods" as may become necessary ; and pro
viding for a $100,000,000 bond issue, to be used in his
discretion for war insurance to encourage American com
merce to brave the submarine peril. The bill may be
brought up in f.he house tomorrow with special rules for
its immediate consideration.
A similar bill will be considered tomorrow by the
senate foreign relations committee.
Congress May Split.
The President's long expected action, while received
in the main with expressions of support, threatens to
force an extra session of congress.
G. O. P. Oppose It
Republicans. disinclined to
grant blanket authority while con
gress is in recess, give evidence
of opposing the legislation the
President asks, not for the pur
Pose of withholding it, but to
force him to have congress in spe
cial session to take a hand in the
next steps which they feel will
lead to war. The Republicans are
receiving passive support from
the Democratic element classed
as pacificist.
United Front Needed
The President's aovlsors de
plore this situation for its effect
in Germany where they are con
vinced it will feed the officials im
pression that congress will not
support the President if he finds
it necessary to go to war and that
he is not speaking the sentiment
of a united country.
The Sticking Point
"The President's request for
authority to use "other instru
mentalities" is the principal stick
ing point. Even the Republicans
and some of the Democrats who
hesitate to give him what he asks
say they would be willing to give
him authority to arm American
ternational practice-, and without re-
gard to any considerations of human
itv which might intetfere wira tneir
object. That policy was forthwith
put into practice. It has now been in
active execution for nearly four
weeks.
Causes America Suffering
"Its practical results an- not fully

neutral nations is suffering severely
but not. perhaps, very much more se
verely than it was already sufl'eiine

and vill probably live up to their
promises, but the idea is just this:
I will set more value in votes, by

special offtrs. far more, than I wiil
receive at the end. For instance, for
a one year subscription turned in be

five hundred votes. That is,' if the
subscription is a new one. The scale
of votes has been steadily reduced
fi'jm the besinnins and will continue
to be reduced till the end. I have
tried to explain this to those from
whom I have asked subscriptions; yes,
I will venture to say that I have ex
plained it in a dozen different ways,
but it is always the same answer:

ARMED NEUTRALITY
VITAL SAYS WILSON
(Continued From Tage One)
people is substantially the same as it
was when I addressed you on the
third of February except for the tjing
up of our shipping in our own ports
because of the unwillingness of our
ship owners to risk their vessels at
sa without insurance or adequate
protection and the very serious con
gestion of our commerce which has
resulted, a congestion which is grow
ing rapidly more and more serious
every day.
No Overt Act Yet
"This in itself might presently ac
complish, in effect, what the new Ger
man submarine ordeis were meant to
accomplish, so far as we are concern
ed. We can only say, therefore, that
the overt act which I have ventured
to hope the German commanders
would in fact ovoid has not occurred.
"But while this is happily true, it
must be admitted that there have
been certain additional indications
and expressions of purpose oo the
part of the German press and the Ger
man authorities which have increased
rather than lessened the Impression
that, if our ships and our people are
spared, it will be because of fortunate
circumstances, or because the com
manders of the Germain submarines
which they may happen to encounter
exercise an unexpected discretion and
restraint rather than because of the
instructions under which those com
manders are acting.
Situation Not Grave
'It would be foolish to deny that
the situation is fraught with the grav
est possibilities and dangers. No
houchtful man can fail to see that
the necessity for definite action come
at any time, if we are in fact, and not
in word merely, to, defend our elemen
tary rights as a neutral lia'ion. It
would be most imprudent to be unpre
pared. "I cannot i-n such circumstances be
unmindful of the fact that the expira
tion of the term of the present con
irress is immediately at hand, by con
stitutional limitations and that it
would in all likelihood require an un
usual length of time to assemble and
organize the congress which is to suc
ceed it.
"I feel that I ought in view of that
fact, to obtain, from you full and im
mediate assurance of the authority
which I may need at any moment to
--orcise. No donb I already possess
'vnt nower. without special warrant
of wsr bv t'e plain imnlication of ray
constitutional duties and powers, bnt
I prefer, in the present ci-cums' vncor
- ct to act upon general implication.
"I wish to feel that the authority
-nd lhe power of the congress are be
in whatever it ray become ne
cessary for me to do. We are jointly
tve servants of te ponle. and nuts
't together end in their spirit, so tar
-s w ecan (Wine a nd interpret 't.
"No one riauhts what it is our duty
o do. We must defend our commerce

-idst of the present, trying circii""
ctanc( s. with discretion -but. with clear
ind steadfast purpose. Only the
-rifcod and the extent remain to be
"hosen. upon the occasion, if occas
ion should indeed arise.
"Since it has unhappily proved im
possible to safeguard our neutral
rights ty diplomatic means against
he unwarranted infringements they
rp suffering at the hands of Germany
here may be recourse but to armed
neutrality, which we shall know how
'o maintain and for which then 1
ibundant American precedent.
"It is devotedly to be hoped that it
will not be necessary to put armed
force anywhere into action. The Am
erican people do not. desire it 'and our
iosire is not different from theirs. I
am sure that they will understand the
spirit in which I am now standing.

They were stokers, coal trimmers,

While details of the cargo, of the
Laconia are withheld under a recent
ruling of the custo'cs officials, it was
learned at the office of the company
that the fallowing items were among
the principal commodities carried:
One thousand bars of silver, 40.000
bushels of wheat, 2,84.1 bales of cot
ton. 1.40S boxes of fresh fruit, 3."0
tor.s of shell casings and other war
supplies, and 9.0oo tons of provisions.
It was positively stated by officials
of the line that there were no explos
ives on board.
U. S. Mail Lost
In addition to cargo and passengers
the Laconia carried 5.000 bags of U.
S. and Canadian mail. l."U0 sacks of

American liner St. Iuis. The La

Holland-American liner Ryndam re

from her voyage to Rotterdam by the

nine of the Ryndam's passengers.
Sunk Without Warning
The laconia, when she left here,
was armed with one defense gun,
moim'ed aft. The report that the
ship was torpedoed at night and with
out warning, indicates that there was
no opportunity to ufce the defense gun
according to officials of the line.
The Laconia is the second ship to
be sunk of the former Hoston-Liver-pool
service of the our.ard line. A
sister ship, the Kranconia, was sunk
last October in the Mediterranean
while in the Itrilish service. Roth
vessels were taken over by the Rrit
ish admiralty soon after the war be
gan, and the Laconij was for a while
used in the service of the govern
ment as a transport. She was only
recently restored to her owners for
commercial purposes, and the trip on
which she was sunk was her third af
ter coming back to the service for
which she was built. Several of the
officers in the steward's department
were on the Laconia and were on the
Kranconia when she went down.
The registered gross tonnage of the
Laconia was lS.l.'.O, her length was
C'-'.". feet and she had a beam of 72
feet. Designed for high class passen

Modern marine architecture.

President's words, then, falling upon
a body of grave, silent legislators, as
sembled before him in a sombre mom

the declarations which' may lead the
United States into war.
Not Asking War
But the President made it clear
that America was asking to exercise
none but the rights of peace; that he
was not proposing nor contemplating
war. He was thlnkin?, he said, of
the rights of life itself, the rights of
humanity; "without which there is no
civilization" rights deeper and more
fundamental thai merely th eriL'hts
of Americans.
"No couise of my choosing nor of
theirs." said the President, "will lead
to war War can .come only by the
wilful act? and aggressions of oth
ers." - '

POLITICS AND SCHOOLS.
It is regrettable in the extreme that the University cf
Arizona, its president and its board of regents, should
become involved in a combat of words with a teacher
that has been dismissed from the institution. It is more
regrettable, however, that the right thinking people of
the state of Arizona, which includes a host, of teachers,
should permit themselves to indulge in sentimental rav
ings for the discharged instructor or should permit thenn
selves to be used by him.
Many people in every part of the state of Arizona, un
doubtedly, received in yesterday's mail a small folder
entitled "The University Rumpus". It consisted of a
series of charges made by I. Colodny, who styles him
self "Prof." At the end of the screed appears three
signatures. The intent, obviously, is to discredit the
president of the University by implying that, recently,
he has changed his name. If a man desires to change
the style of his signature, sane people can Jiardly see
anything in it which is reprehensible.
"Pror." Colodny has made much of an episode (par
ticularly in the Arizona Teacher o; which he is the
editor) whereby he was presented witJi a watch by the
student body of the University of Arizona. In one of
the Tucson papers, of last week, the student body went
on record as disclaiming any letter of sympathy which
the discharged teacher may exhibit.
We take no stock in the charges made by Colondy
that his discharge was brought about by certain design
ing people of Tucson who disliked the instructor's wife's
activities in the Civic League of the Old Pueblo. Cer
tainly, there must be something else behind the entire
affair.
Colodny, while he was in Phoenix, was noted for his
officiousness. It is very probable that, after establishing
himself in Tucson, he tried the same tactics there and
the university officials decided that his influence was far
from good for the state institution.
The president of the University j has refused to enter
into the controversy with the "Prof." and has left the
held entirely to him. As a consequence, Coloduy has cd
dcavored to stir the legislature into action in his behalf.
He ha even dragged Hunt politics into the affair, in-1
fcrring that bis espousal of the anti-capital punishment
measure has brought the wrath of the former govcrbor's
political enemies on bis head.
A cool, casual look into Colodny's version of the affair,
without a glance at the side of the. University president
of the board of regents of that institution, appears to us
in Uie same light of the schoolboy's tale of his chastise
ment at the hands or his teacher. In other words every
controversy has two sides. When only one is presented,
oftentimes, it is so overbalanced that there is something,
obviously, wrong with it.- N
"Prof." Colodny .had lietter be forgotten. If lie can
make his mark in any nearby state, Arizona will b-.:
pleased to look back and say "We had him, once; but
we didn't know it was in him."
las it Is not "Sunset and evening star, and after that the
dark; but "Sunset and silvery smoke, and after that the
light.'
"The Catalinas, mantled in sun-glow that has been en
riched by ceaseless fires of the Douglas furnaces, may
turn the faces of Tucson folk toward the temple of Mor
pheus with pride and wonder, but, once they have gone
to the quietness of repose, they cannot open the gates of
sleep, look in the direction of Japan and Yuma and revel
in the splendor of a sunset that never dies. This can be
done here. All one has to do is to raise the west win
dow, and lo, the great blaze of red yet is writhing on the
breast of the plain the slag dump is a fight for the
Smelter City that Jias never failed. Would you like to
have it, Tucson?"
Mr. Stuart makes one observation of the Tucson sun
sets which is his best controbution "Perhaps nothing in
the world looks as good to a resident of Tucson as a sun
set in the summertime". We hight add that the rea
son, then, is comparable to the joy of some married men
in seeing their mother-in-law's to the station.
We can't see, however, why, just because the sun sets
earlier in Douglas, it is any more alluring or more beauti
ful in Douglas than in Tucson. Moreover, should this
observation remain" unchallanged7t would stand to rea
son that the sun. in Pittsburg, by reason of its earlier
settings, is more beautiful than in Douglas. And God
forbid that!
To continue: ". . . but, when lie pillows his weary
head on the fleecy billows of the desert's sands the ling-
ering glory of his rest is bathed in the endless waftings
! of a coppery veil that clothes his smiling sleep as a gar
ment of pearls over a form of gold".
Now wouldn't that put Senator Ashurst" s description of
the Grand Canycn (which, by the way Paul Geary of
Corporation Commission fame claims credit for) to
shame? Wouldn't Gautier, in his wildest ravings about
esthetic beauty turn over in his grave and give a last
order to have his matserpiece of descriptive writings
cast into the limbo of forgotten things? And wouldn't
Ruskin wonder over "his weary head", "the glory of his
rest", and "the endless waftings or a coppery veil that
clothes his smiling sleep as a garment of peurls over a
form of gold"?
And why blame the Bisbee road or the Arizona guards
men at Naco for any freaks that the Sun, in its passage
through Southern Arizona .might indulge in? "The end
less waitings of a coppery veil" always appears to us as
an aggravated form of fog; for fog is exhilirating while
"the endless waftings of a coppery veli" always contain
a smell that is lest to run from. On t'lis feature we con
gratulate the Douglas editor in being able to got inspira
tion lrom smelter smoke. What would he do at Vesuvius
or on the rim of Kiluai? We leave it to an unhaised
imagination.
As for the sunsets in Bisbee, we are quite content with
them. They are not obscured by smelter smoke and by
dust storms nor when summer comes do we sigh and give
thinks; and regret that this "weary" old party will be
back with us at some time near 5 o'clock the next morn
ing. If anyone has the edge on the Sun, winter and sum
mer, it is certainly the Warreu District. Seeing is believing.

GETTING THE LEAVINGS

The Upper Verde Valley, in the
neighborhood of Camp Verde, was
snowbound for several days last week.
It was necessary for travelers be
tween the Verde and Prescott to
make the trip by team over an old
highway and through deep drifts 'of
snow. The Cherry Creek Hill was
completely impassable.
EDITORIAL SUNSETS.
Tucson Citizen and Douglas Dispatch are vicing with
each other in florid descriptions of their respective sun
sh. First, the editor of the Citizen ventured iuto th"
descriptive field, laud ins the sunsets, at Tucson. Mr.
Stuart, of the Dispatch, then veutured forth and gave a
real description of old Sol when he left Douglas in its
haze of smelter smoke.

Phoenix is to have a new bank with
a capitalization of IWO.OOO. It will be
called the Drovers Bank and Trust
Company. Walter Wold being the or
ganizer of the institution. The incor
porators are E. H. Martin. Charles K.
Pishon and Wolf. Eastern capital is
said to be largely interested in th
new Salt River Valley financial insti
tution.
Jaetb Aaron and Mrs. Aaron, the
parents of the little Phoenix newsboy
who was run over and killed by a
motor bus near the entrance to River
side Park last year, were given $10,000
damages in their suit against M. W.
Maxwell, an automobile man of the
capital city. Little Harry Aaron was
one of the best known newsboys in
the state, having lived in Phoenix sev
eral years. He was, practically, tin
sole support of bis father and m'Jther.
Mrs. Teresa M. de Elias, a resident
of Tucson when the lower part of what
is now the state of Arizona was a part
of Mexico, died at her home in the
Old Pueblo several days ago. She
was a native of Tubac and was sev
enty nine years old.
NINE DAYS MORE.
Nine days remain of the first session of the third
state legislature and there appears some possibility that
a minority of the legislature would like to remain in the
state house until the hot weather iriThoenix. So far the
net result of constructive legislation has been nil.
The appropriation bill, shaved in its extent and its con
tent, got into trouble in the house last Saturday. Ik is
likely to encounter further trouble before it reaches Gov
ernor Campbell's hands and it may never reach that of
ficial's office.
It, at the end of the statutory period, Arizona finds it
self without an appropriation bill, may the blame be at
tached to those who actually deserve it; to those who
would rather pcttcr away their time in Phoenix than be
at home at their work. For, if we can see aright into
the immediate future, the legislators are reckoning with
out full knowledge when they feel that extra session per
diem coming into their hands.
STOPPING A CAR.
Now and then some insignificant member of the much
abused public rises in his wrath and asserts his rights
and gets them for a brief while. A story is told of one
Jacob Pogodo, of Toledo, Ohio, who thus assailed a hard
hearted corporation and won a street ear ride.
It was a bitter cold night not long ago. Pogodo wan
waiting for a trolley on one of the principal street cor
ners iu Toledo. Six cars passed hliu iu spite of hi? de
spairing signals. A seventh came along. It indicated its
hcartlessuess by rumbling past tho shivering figure at th-j
( rossing just as the other six had done.
By this time, however, Mr. Pogodo was ready to a-t.
He pursued that trolley car on foot, overtook it, jumped
for the trolley rope, caught it and pulled. The car stop
ped. Of course, this hero was arrested in the end. But
he'd had his ride, and he had showed that. e n t'
haughty troll'.-y and its crew must occasionally bow to
the will of the common man. It. is to be Imped that other
would be passengers may profit by Mr. Pogodo's self
sacrificing deed. Toh-do strap-hangers might even be
expected to talic up a collectiou to defend Mr. I'ogodu'd
rights in court.
At. any ra'c, there is probably at. P-ast one motonnn
in Toledo who stops his car nowadays when signalled
from thy street. . . .-
E! Zaribah Temple of Nobles of the

were the two leading figures in se
curing the necessarv funds with which
to guarantee the start of the building.
It will be erected on a lot which the

LONDON. Feb. 26. Henry E. Duke,
chief secretary for Ireland, told the
Mouse of Commons today that 2S per-;
sons had been arrested in lrtiana un
der the defense of the realm act. He
said it was not proposed to try the
prisoners. John Dillon, nationalist
leader, announced that he w'ould call
to the situation in the House.
Mr. Dillon later in moving an ad
journement of the house, declared
that the situation in Ireland was ex
tremely serious and said the govern
ment had taken good care that it
should remain so.
Ireland, Mr. Dillon asserted, in real- j
ity now was living under martial law. I
Characterizinc the arrets as "in-!
conceivably stupid." Mr. Dillon ac
cused the government of reversing
the Irish policy of the last govern
ment and predicted that the policy of
provocation would continue until some
bloody explosion or horrible disaster
occurred in Ireland.
Replying to .Mr. Dillon. Mr. Duke
denied any change in policy with re
gard to Ireland. The arrests, he said.
were not due to any new policy of J
repression. I
The secretary declared that if he i
told all he knew he would satisfy thej
house that what had been done a:
resolved upon with regret but wasj
justified by absolute necessity. He de
clined to enter into details, on the I

j .Manager dacK?uii, ui me t-uiiai
theatre, announces for today an en
gagement extraordinary in the first
appearance as an independent star of
the most famous motion picture act
ress of them all, .Mary Pickford. Her
newest and most elaborate play of her
long career is called "Less Than the
Dust" and was written especially for
her by Hector Turnbull. whose name
on a manuscrips is complete evidence
of superlative merit. He credits his
inspiration for the story of "Less Than
the Dust" to a poem Vt the same name
written by Laurence Hope. As devel
oped and elalf.irated the play tells the
story of a little English castaway who
is living in India practically an cut
cast and regarded by the natives as
actually "less than the dust" which
they 'stir up as they walk. In her
conception of the heroine Miss Pick
ford takes full advantage of the op
portunities offered for the display of
the wh'.de run of emotions from tear
compelling characterization to the
well-known ability of the little star
for extracting clean and wholesome
fun from the situations provided by
the author.
"I-ess Than the Dust" contains
many really big scenes, many of
which are furnished by an uprising
of the natives against England. A
complete city was erected for the
i filming of these scenes, hundreds of
j extra people were employed and vari
ous zoological exhibits were ransacked
! for the rare animals required to con
vey the necessary atmosphene. Pic
turesque indeed are the settines pro
vided for Mary Pickford and acorn-
pany of supporting players of high
and evenly balanced merit will be
seen when "Less Than the Dust" is
presented by Artcraft Pictures Cor
poration, which was organized espe

(Special to the Review)
BOWIE. Feb. 26. Frank Boyle, a
resident of Bowie for about a month,
was killed Saturday by a Mexican
about 40 miles south of Willcox. Boyle
a ii I a companion named Owen are
said to have picked up the Mexican
while following a pack train of burros
loaded with whiskey. Owen, it is
claimed, left Boyle and the Mexican
together while he went to get a wagon
to haul the whiskey in. When he re
turned he found Boyle's body. The
American had evidently been beaten
to death. The Mexican was tracked
toward Willcox but had not been cap
tured up to eight o'clock tonight.
Boyle's body was taken to Safi'ord and
will be shipped to California tomorrow
for burial. His widow left here yes
terday lor the scene of the crime. She
will accompany the body 'o California.
Every American honors Nathan
Hale, the man who said: "I regret that
I have but one life to give for my
country." "The Heart of a Hero,"
which comes to the Royal today, is a
visualization of the romantic side of
Nathan Hale, the immortal hero of the
American Revolution. The settings in
this picture, exterior and Interior, are
most authentic of the times when
America was in its making. It rings
with patriotism, thrills with excite
ment, cherishes with fond memories,
and fjuches the heart with its wonder
ful love. It is a story that the whole
world will enjoy seeing, for the reason
that it portrays the strength of a
strong man and a loving woman, and
as one ol the critics said. "It a story
that will be discussed by everybody
for its greatness and its bcautv."

A GREAT MEDICINE.
That most successful of all reme- j
dies for woman's ailments, Lydia K.
1'inkham s Vegetable Compound, owes
its origin to a botanic recipe which
came into the possession of Lydia K. I
iM'nl'll.l III ifSlll lift,. ....... nnr
This recipe has proved so effective '
in the practise of a skilled physician
that Mrs. 1'inkham procured the herbs ,
and steeped and prepared them in '
true old-time fashion on her kitchen '
stove for her friends and neighbors
who suffered from woman's ailments, i
The fame of the virtues of this won-'
lerful medicine spread, until it is to
day recognized as the standard remedy
lor woman's ills. (Advertisement)

in Arizona Ray
Market Now 14Vc Bid,
15c Asked
We Withdraw Our Offer of ll4c. Send us Your
orders at the Market or we will deliver at 12c, you
to pool Stock for 60 days only.
In the last issue of our COPPER AND COLD LETTER we pre
dicted a sharp advance in Arizona Ray shares. WE WERE RIGHT! !
The stock has advanced 4c during the last three days, one of which
was a holiday.
The allotment to cover our special offering of 11ic was over
subscribed within twenty-four hours after our COPPER AND GOLD
LETTER was mailed. We were obliged to return a number of unfilled
orders while other orders which read "at the market" we were able to
fill at prices ranging from 12c to 15'2C.
RAY CONSOLIDATED has advanced to $27.00, while RAY HER
CULES remains firm at $4.25. Both of these properties join and par
tially surround the property of the ARIZONA RAY COPPER COM
PANY. The LOS ANGELES TIMES of February 22nd says: ,
"Development work on the Arizona Ray properties is being pushed
with all possible speed, and the officials of the corporation state that
they expect to make an Important announcement within a short space
of time."
If the Company has an important announcement to make they have
not given it to us up to the time of this issue going to press. That in
siders have "something up their sleeve," is generally rumored both
here and in Los Angeles and San Francisco, the Exchanges in which
cities report a growing activity in Arizona Ray shares.
ARIZONA RAY today is by far the best speculative issue being
traded in among the Arizona Copper stocks.
The location of the property is ideal. The property is being vigor
ously developed under the direction of Fred E. Young, E. M., one of
Arizona's really successful mining men. That the shares will eventu- '
ally sell at much higher levels is universally predicted by shrewd
traders.
We have withdrawn offerings of Pool Rights entirely and have dis
continued the sale of same in all of our various offices and are at this
'time putting all the pressure at our disposal behind an aggressive cam
paign on the remaining treasury shares under our contract ON AN
ADVANCED MARKET.
To enable us to give those who have been following this issue a
final opDortunity to purchase the shares at their present low level, in
fact, AT A DISCOUNT OF 25 PER CENT FROM THE PRESENT
LEVEL, we are going to make this SPECIAL OFFER TO THOSE
WHO ARE WILLING TO HOLD THEIR STOCK FOR SIXTY DAYS
BEFORE DISPOSING OF SAME.
SPECIAL OFFER
Good Until Allotment Is Exhausted
We wilt accept subscriptions either for cash or on Twelve-Payment
Plan in 1000 share lots for Arizona Ray, REGULAR STOCK (NOT
POOL RIGHTS) at 12c per share providing the holder will sign an
agreement not to dispose of or transfer his stock for sixty days
from date. Thus, stock purchased under this offer, which holds
good only until our present allotment is exhausted, will be released
on April 23rd. This should not be confused in anyway with Pool
Rights, the stock held under which, is pooled for an indefinite
period.
We know Arizona Ray, and we believe in it. We want to be able
at some time in the near future to say, "I told you so," both to the wise
investor who has purchased the shares and to the "Doubting Thomas"
who still hesitates.
ARIZONA RAY AT PRESENT MARKET IS THE OPPORTUNITY OF
THE JUNIOR COFPERS
Send your orders for IMMEDIATE DELIVERY "at the market" or
under the SPECIAL OFFER at the following schedule:
FOR CASH

The recent flotation in Japan of a
British loan for luO.000,000 yen or
$30,000,000 was a great success. A
few days after the lists were opened
to the public the syndicate which had
the issue in charge udvcitii-.ed that tu
more subscriptions would be rei i-iveil.

out these little olive-colored tablets.
These pleasant little tablets do the
good that calomel docs, but have no had
after effects. They don't injure the

: They take hold of the trouble and
quickly correct it. Why cure the liver
at the expense of the teeth? Calomel
sometimes plays h3oc with the sums.
So do stronir liquids. It is best n it to

cultnral nation, to seek an outlet

pose he thinks it is necessary to in
crease the shipping interests, to de
velop markets for Japanese goods in
foreign lands and to encourage the de
velopment of domes' ic manufacturing
industry.
He declares that the rising genera
tion of the country must open their
eyes to the situation and the pressing
need of the time, and volunteer them
selves for the commercial campaign in
the foreign market. He concludes:
"Let the commerce of the Japanes."1
Empire follow the sun (lags which are
now sighted in almost every nook and
corner of the Orient and the Souther i
seas and are gradually moving els -
where in the world."
(me part of the wmld where Jap
anese commerce has made its most
remarkable strides
forward is t!
U'le
W estern Hemisphere. The enormous
prosperity of the United State- has
created a demand in that country for
luxuries from Japan, and the articl'
which forms the bulwark of the for
eign export trade to this country, raw
silk and hahutae, has exceeded th
ino.non.nno yen mark this year. T
tbc other countries of the Wester 1
Hemisphere, too. Japanese exports
have increased greatly, anil the pre
gss made by the Japanese merchants
in the countries of South America's
I'ai'ilic slope and also with Brazil ami
Argentine is regarded as reniarkahl".
I The importance which Japan give
I to Ihe d-wclopment of her foreii;'
