Service Hath' Its Own
Reward
Yesterday was a granl -day in Bisbee, U. S. A. Hun
dreds and hundreds of workingmen were standing most
of the day in Ions lines awaiting their turn to appear
before the window and daw down their hundred dollars,
or fifty, as the ease might be, as their bonus for con
tinuous service in the employ of the mining companies
of this district. Every man with a years continuous
service to his credit was to have a hundred dollars as a
New Year's gift, and fc-r six months service, fifty dol
lars. The streets were thronged all day by men with
glad faces and alert carriage and jaunty step.
This bonus came as a complete surprise. Christmas
had come and fceen numbered with the yesterdays. The
New Year was in its second week and had shed its
swaddling clothes. Th. men were figuring closely on
their pay checks and expected to reduce some of the
Christmas debts to a point where they could wipe them
cut before Washington's birthday came along.
And then came the announcement of the decision of
the companies to make the New Year a happy one indeed.
It would seem. Judging by the companies' action of
yesterday, that it is their policy to reward service and
loyalty and stick-to-itiveness. And this is as it should
be. Surely the man who has worked here year in and
year out, through thick and thin, in summer heat and
winter cold, in time of calm -and in time of storm, is
entitled to some further consideration than the man who
came yesterday and may go away tomorrow.
Here is a man who has worked here for five years.
He rets good pay. it is true. Better than five dollars
a day. That is enough for any workingman. it is argued.
Yes. But this man was dependable. He stayed with
his work when other men threw down their tools and
threatened loyal men. The storm passes and this
man still receives his five dollars and a quarter a day.
Here comes a man from the Pacific coast or from
Utah or Montana. He may be only a fair miner and
he mar rare nothing for "Bisbee and her homes against
the mountain siies. But the scale is five and a quarter,
and he receives that same pay along with the old miner
who is an expert at the game and who has builded here
and who loves this town and has proved his appreciation
of good treatment by unswerving loyalty to the com
pany. .
Reward for service. It is a fine thing. It promotes
loyalty just as kindness makes the cheek glow and a
smile makes the heart 'hat stronger.
The company hopes, soon, to announce a plan where
by continuous service will receive special consid
eration." declares Grant H. Dowell. manager of the
Copper Queen, in commenting in his own brief hut ef
fective way upon the bonus checks. This sentence means
the dawn of a brighter, better day for every workingmai
in the district who builc's for his home, his family and
his future with some pride in the building. It means a
bigger, better town here and it means a surer future.
It strikes directly at the empty mou things or the agitator
and the shiftlessness of the shirker and the general all
'round worthlessness of the barnstormer, all of whom de
pend in a measure upon the misplaced generosity of the
steady worker.
Consider what this splendid generosity of these com
panies, the C. and A., the Sbattuck and the Copper
Queen, mean to the principal cities of this county. The
strike is over. No strike is threatened or even talked
of at this time. .Yet these companies yesterday gave
out over one hundred and eighty-three thousand dollars
in cold cash in Bisbee alone and about one hundred
thousand dollars in Douglas: Gave these immense sums
and simply as reward bf service. Gave them to men
who were tried and not found wanting. Gave them for
continuous service of six months and a year. Gave
them willingly, gladly, and without sound of drum or
flourish of trumpet. Tais newspaper had to call ap the
officials on the telephone to get the details. Their only
word or announcement oi the matter was that made to
the men themselves by their own bosses. The men of
every trade fared alike. The manner of the giving was
as fine as the gift itself. There were no strings attached
to it; no conditions; no If or ands. Just as plain unvarn
ished token of sincere and deep appreciation for those
who were faithful.
It is a fine thing to write about, this distribution of
a quarter of a million dollars among the workingmen
of two closely knit communities. It cheers every heart
in this town, whether he be beneficiary or not. for it
means a great year for Bisbee. For years and years the
three big companies here have enjoyed a most enviable
reputation for big and generous and fair dealing with
their men and with all men of the community. These
companies have striven in every way to build up the
community and all its business interests. Every worthy
cause has always had their support. In fact, their name
for fair and fine treatment to every class of men who
play life's game upon the square has spread far beyortd
the boundaries of this county. In the north and the east
are men who have worked for these companies in days
gone by who sing their praises today in that warm and
sincere speech that cannot be gainsaid.
No man could stand upon the streets of Bisbee yes
terday and not be affected by the spirit of the day. This
busy canyon, that teems with life always and throbs
like the beat of a triphammer with the ebb and flow
of its industrial endeavor, was fairly crowded with men
and women who looked the new year in the face with
shining eyes. Every man who came forward and re
ceived his money could look the world in the face and
say he earned it. Loyalty and steadfastness are worthy
of their reward. Their possessor is happy indeed, for
not only is he richer 'n purse, but, deep down in his
true and faithful heart there is a feeling that is worth
more than gold or much fine spun gold. He has done
his duty as he saw it; he has been dependable and his
work has been appreciated by real men. What more
could he ask?
The beginning of the new year finds the allies facing
two deadly perils in their war with Germany. They are
the submarine and a giant offensive on the western
front. America is not yet ready to do her part. Will the
allies prepare for these perils in real man fashion or
will they flitter away time and neglect to prepare means
as they have done so often before? They knew of the
peril to Servia and yet they did nothing. They knew
of the peril of Russia and yet they did nothing. Will they
act now? The war peril to Christendom from Germany
is greater today than it has ever been before. This gov
ernment realises it fully, and it is common knowledge
to all well informed newspaper men. The allies look
to America for the initiative to win the war, and America
looks to the allies as the natural leaders because of
their experience. Past mistakes and delays were natural
in a war of such tremendous proportions. But the time
to escape in spite of errors has passed. When a menace
looms ahead instant preparation with every ounce of
energy and power must be made to meet it. Thus, and
thus only, can Germany be beaten. We can beat Ger
many if we win only jump in and do it. But through
every species of folly fnd incompetency and hesitation
and delay we have allowed her to continue thus far
with the war with her strength unimpaired, when, with
military and civil leaders of genius and daring and
prompt resolution. Germany would now be beaten to her
knees, or at the worst, no longer dangerous. The time
for decisive action and foresight and iron resolution is
at hand.
"Proud and with a thankful heart, I behold you. my
brave, resolute leaders and my heroic troops. With an
unstained shield and a sharp sword we stand on the
threshold of the new year around the imperial war lord
ready to strike and win. God with us." Thus raves the
German crown prince sfter sacrificing more than a mil
lion of these "heroic troops" before Verdun and the
Chemin des Dames in fruitless efforts to drive the
French back a foot from positions they had won. His
"unstained shield" is black with every species of butchery,
bestiality, dishonor. He says that God is with hira. Yes
God is with him. like He is with every unspeakable
tyrant, God has immutable laws regarding mankind that
mortal can understand, but the world has seen outrage
and oppression and brute force rise to supreme heights
and fall always into black oblivion. Yes, God is with
the crown prince and his terrible sire, but He is with
them as an angel of justice holding a flaming sword
that will surely fall, for is it not written in God's word.
"The wicked shall flourish like a green hay tree, hut in
the end they shall be cut eff utterly, root and branch."
An Austrian at Jerome. Arizona, keeper of a butcher
shop, has set an example in high class patriotism that
can well be followed by the best of our Ameri'an citi
sens. He closes his shop every nreatless day and takes
a pride in it, even though he loses money by his action.
Word came to him that one of bis assistants had come
to the shop on a meatless day and rarved off a big rhur.k
of tenderloin and taken it home and eaten it on that day.
This Austrian butcher railed the man to him and charged
t him with this petty piece of disloyalty. The man hai to
acknowledge his guilt. "Well, all I've got to say."
said the Austrian butcher, with vehemence, "is that no
man with no more red blood in his veins than you've
got can work for me. You are fired." The Review takes
off its battered and weather stained grey Stetson hat
to this Austrian butcher and bows low and low indeed.
A I"boenix business man. in the district ime day last
week, declared to a Bisbee citizen that a ropy of The
Review containing a Phoenix writeup was passed from
merchant o merchant and commented upon in most
kindly fashion. Word like this warms the heart of ti e

yards only 100 of the. 1.100 carloads
expected made their way through the

the city's produce commission firms,
presented an unusual scene of deser

the cattle companies, has been located
by homesteaders, who have fenced
their lands and divided the valley in
to one big checker board of farms.
These settlers have come from all
states of the union and seme foreign
.-o-'n'ries. With their desire to get
homes for themselves and their fami
lies they have developed their lands
frcm year to year, sometimes depend
ing upon the rainfall to make their
crops, but eventually digging wells
and installing pumping plants to get
Ihoir water for irrigation from the
great underground supply.
There were 4S of these pumping
nlcnts in operation in the . McNeal
Basin during the past season. The
crcps raised under them, during the
yt-r just closed, consisted of sweet
potatoes, beans, melons, corn, all
l:i:ids of garden truck, hay and grain
The value of this McNeal Basin crop
f conservatively estimated at SliXV
COO.0O0. Most of these crops were
o!d in Bisbee and Douglas and the
mrney derived from their sales was
put back onto the farms in the way of
improvements.
One new store has been built, mak
ing fire stores, at various points in
'he valley, which depend entirely up
on these farmers for their business.
The past year shows a great increase
over the year previous.
Many carloads of fine stock, lumber
and machinery have been shipped in
to the valley. Many new houses have
been built. Over 50 farmers have
bought new autos or motor trucks to
curry their produce to the markets.
One man alone made over 150 daily
trips to Douglas hauling over a ton
to each load. Over $10,000 worth o
5a r Jen truck in one season. Figure
it for yourself.
Another man took over $2,000 worth
of truck from one acre, which his
handy wife and son sold in Bisbee
fresh every day with the aid of Ueir
.Haey.
Many of the farmers raised stork
xhich they put into silos and fed to
rattle and hogs. The women folks
have canned many jars of produce.
The schools have been greatly im--itoved.'
Many miles of valley roads
Jtve been graded and improved.
Many babies have arrived upon the
"rious farms.
Many farms have changed hands and
the value of land has increased. A
rural free mail dedivery has been es
tablished out from McNeal postoifice.
A farmers" telephone line has been
strung along the fences connecting
15 farms with McNeaL
A splendid fair was held at McNeal
and Light. Exhibits from these fairs
were taken to the state fair and won
many prizes.
