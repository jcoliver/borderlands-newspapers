BOARD QUITS
Unable! to Bring Railroads
Under Steel Price Ruling,
Members Resign in a Body
'
Resources of Courtesy Are
Exhausted, Says Reclfield;
Supply and Demand to Rule
WASHINGTON", May 9. Govern
mental efforts to hasten the return of
industry to normal peace time astiv
ity by stabilizing prices through the
industrial board of the department
of commerce came to an end today.
Following a final unsuccessful effort
to bring the railroad administration
and steel producers to an agreement
on prices yesterday in New York, the
resignation of Chairman George N.
Peck of Moline, Ills., and the other
six members of the board were accept
ed by Secretary Redfield. The resig
nations, tendered April 22 when the
railroad administration first refused to
accept the reduced steel prices ar
ranged by the board on the ground
that they were too high, had been
held in abeyance until Mr. Redfield
was satisfied the board had exhausted
every effort to stimulate an Industrial
revival through the satisfying of the
largest single purchaser of materials
in the country.
Nation Left to "Supply and Demand"
With the dissolution of the board,
the natural forces of supply and de
mand will be left to readjust prices
from war levels to those of peace. Di
rector General HInes announced yes
terday that the railroad administra
tion would return to the old system of
competitive bidding in placing its or
ders. Government officials declared they
did not know whether the steel pro
ducers would keep in force the price
schedule approved by the industrial
board and which was the basis of all
bids recently submitted for 20,000
tons of steel needed by the navy. It
became known that when the. legality
of price agreements arranged by the
board was submitted to Attorney Gen
eral Palmer, he rendered an .opinion
that such action was not authorized
by law, but did not declare that such
an agreement would.be Illegal. Other
officials held that the purely voluntary
nature of new price schedules, ar
ranged by a board which admittedly
was without power to influence the
prices and seeking merely to stimulate
business by effecting reductions, put
the agreements without the pale of
the Sherman law. '
Steel Only Prices Fixed '
The steel schedule was the first and
only one ever promulgated by the
board which was appointed in March.
Representatives of. four other indus
tries coal, cement, hardwood and
pine lumber had expressed a willing
ness to co-operate with the board,
and conferences looking to price re
ductions had been held.
In announcing his acceptance of
the resignations of the board mem
bers, Mr. Redfield made the following
statement:
"That board was conceived in the
spirit of unselfish public service and
has so acted from the beginning. I

WILSON TO BRING
fBv Review Leased Wire)
WASHINGTON, May 9. Authorita
tive statements of opinion by most
senators on the treaty of Versailles
probably will not be forthcoming until
after congress has met in extra ses
sion. Republican leaders have- announced
their determination not to give final
conclusions until they have had an
opportunity to study the full text of
the treaty and the understanding here
is that the document will not be made
public until after it has been signed.
In the meantime congress will have
convened.
Expressions of views came today
from only two senators, neither of
whom entered into a discussion of the
treaty itself. Senator Borah of Idaho,
republican, in a letter to the editor
of the Boston Transcript reiterating
his opposition to the league of nations
covenant, asked the republican party
to state its position as to the league
and indicated that should approval of
Jt be given he would quit the party.

in a telegram from the

that the club would be glad

VILLA BANDS AGAIN
ACTIVE AT BORDER
Army Split Into Number of
Raiding Parties; No Fear ;
of Juarez Attack
JUAREZ, May 9 Villa bands have
begun to appear in the border zone
following the breaking up of Villa's
main command into small raiding par
ties after he evacuated Parral. A band
of 30 armed and mounted men were
reported at Tierra Blanca, 15 miles
south of here on the Mexican Central
railroad tonight. There is no settle
ment at this station but it is possible
Villa men were sent there to cut the
railroad communication with Chihua
hua City.
Mormons arriving here late today
reported that a small band of Villa
men appeared at Colonia, Juarez, Mon
day, demanding food and forage. When
one of the Mormons went into his
house to obtain the food the rebels
fled, thinking he had gone to give
the alarm.
No fear of an attack is felt by Col.
Jose Gonzales Escobar, the border
commander here, he said tonight. In
addition to the . three regiments of
troops he has a complete regiment of
machine guns and some field batteries
in Ft. Hidalgo. It is believed here
the rebels are scouting for smuggled
ammunition rather than planning mili
tary activities near the border.
MS' Oil THE ALERT
FOR COUP BY JOHN B.
CLEVELAND. May 9. The na
tional executive-committee of the
anti-saloon league at a meeting '
here today decided to appeal to
all churches to call attention
from their pulpits on Sunday;
June 8, to the alleged attempts of
Che ljiquor interests to prevent
prohibition taking effect and urg
ing upon congress the necessity of
effective , legislation.
TREATY TO SENATE
publican, concurred in previous an
nouncements by Senators Borah and
Curtis of Kansas, opposing the pro
posed alliance between the United
States, Great Britain and France. He
said such an entente would lead to
alliances by other groups of nations
with a resulting ipyitatioh' to war.
Direct word came from President
Wilson today that he had promised
France to propose to the senate that
the United States agree, subject to
the approval of the council of the
league of nations, to aid France should
Germany make an unprovoked attack.
The president's message was in reply
to an inquiry from Secretary-Tumulty.
Officials here still professed tonight
to be without information as to when
the president planned to return to
Washington. It is generally believed,
however, that he will not start for
home until the treaty has been signed
and that he will present it in person
to the senate. In some quarters the
opinion is expressed that he will tour
the country, speaking in support of the
treaty and the league covenant.

DOUGLAS, May 9. Fearful of a

early this morning by a band of 22
bandits under leadership of 'a Mex
ican who signed "Bias Flores, viva

goods stolen from .stores pf Cana
nea, Sonora, the presidente municipal
was sending messages to Agua Prie

that assistance be sent him at once.

The revised death list at Cananea
is five, including the chief of police
and four policemen. Twenty-two are
said to have been wounded.
The raid started at 1:30 this morn
ing and came to a conclusion at 4.30.
The raiders first appeared in Ron
quillo, the business section of the mu
nicipality. After an unsuccessful en
deavor to open the vault of the
Banco Mercantil, owned by Frank
Proctor of Los Angeles and J. M.
Glbbs, American consular agent and
a resident of Cananea, the bandits
went to the home of Mr. Almada, the
cashier, forced him to dress and go
to the bank with them. When tie at

LONDON, May 9. An Exchange
Telegraph dispatch from Berlin says
that at a five hour session of the
German cabinet Thursday, Philip
Scheidemann, the chancellor, deliv
ered a speech to the committee ap
pointed to consider the treaty. After'
comparing the most important condi
tions laid down by the allies in con
nection with President Wilson's four
teen points, Scheidemann is reported
to have said:
"These conditions are nothing
else than death for Germany, but
the government must discuss this
document of hatred and madness
with soberness."
The chancellor indicated that the
German delegation at Versailles had
been instructed to hand a note to the
allies showing the differences between
the treaty terms and President Wil
son's fourteen points and submit
counter proposals and endeavor to
start an oral discussion. He express
ed the hope that the peace conditions
would be be considered with good will
by both parties and that a satisfac
tory result would be reached.
CAN'T SIGN, UNANIMOUS VERDICT
BERLIN. Thurscay, May 8. (By
the Associated Press) The people,
though fairly stricken dumb by the
peace terms are recovering sufficient
ly to declare that Germany cannot
and will not sign the compact, no
matter what comes.
Strikes are increasing and Bolshev
ism and the Spartacan uprising of the
past two months have, if anything,
made Germans immune to the pos
sible horrors whicn are to be antici
pated if they are again plunged into
war, according to the best opinion
here.
There exists a small group of
Germans, . chiefly conservatives,
who prefer to see the entente oc
cupy the whole country than to
have it Bolshevik, but they are in
the dwindling minority.
Reports from the Versailles corre
spondents emphasize the feeling of
amazement and excitement which pre
vajled in reading of the terms of the
peace treaty. All the correspondents
agree that no hasty decision will be
reached. A fortnight is allowed the
German delegates for an answer and
this time will be used for careful, con-'
sideration of the demands and the
preparation of counter suggestions,
the correspondents say.
See Ray of Hope,"
There is much speculation in Berlin
as to whether the terms represent
maximum demands which may be re
duced or whether they are minimum
and irreducible.
According to the Berlin Zeitung am
iMattag the delegation at Versailles
will carefully avoid any bargaining,
but will present definite, clear-cut
counter propositions.
"These counter proposals," the
newspaper declares, editorially,
"will be based on the fourteen
points so disgracefully abandoned
by President Wilson. If the Ger
man people had to vote on these
terms, as a whole, there would not
be In the whole empire a single
"yes." Force without measure or
limit that used to be a Wilson
phrase, and the Wilson peace of.
fered us yesterday falls In this
category, Instead of on his four-,

BISBEE BOY BRINGS
WAR ROMANCE BRIDE
Harold Dewey Thomas, a Bisbee
boy, who recently received his dis
charge from the naval service, arrived
home yesterday with his wife, former
ly Miss La Verne Hendrickson, whom
he met while stationed at the Great
Lakes Naval Training station at Lake
Forest, Ills. Mr. Thomas was in the
service for more than a year, during
which time he received special train
ing for ensign in submarine worW and
telegraphy. ,
Realizing he would not be able to
cross to France during the war while
receiving . special training he waived
aside his probable commission and
joined the transportation service. He
had made one trip to France before
the armistice was signed.
Yesterday, Mr. Thomas, who is a
graduate of the Bisbee high school,
gave an interesting talk of his ex
periences to the high school student
body. -He expects to make his home

SON OF MAJ, BROPHY
VEDS SEATTLE GIRL;
TO MAKE HOME HERE
Cathedral Ceremony Notable
Seattle Society Event;
Groom Is Bisbee Boy
The announcement ot the marriage
of Frank Cullen Brophy, Bon of Major
and Mrs. "William -Brophy of this city
to Miss Sallie Blake, a charming so
ciety girl or Seattle, wash., -was re
ceived in the . city yesterday. The
Seattle Times of May 4, portrays the
: wedding ceremony as follows:
With all the solemnity, of high
mass, the religious atmosphere of a
large, beautiful cathedral, amidst beau-
.tiful decorations and surrounded by
friends who had known and loved her
through childhood, Miss Sally Blake,
daughter of Mr. and Mrs. Henry F.
Blake, yesterday at high noon plight
ed her troth to Mr. Frank Cullen
Brophy of Arizona.
Friends witnessing the ceremony
mingled their pleasure with sadness,
for with the ceremony, the bride and
groom will depart to make- their
home in another state, that of Ari
zona. The bride has been a most
popular member of the younger Bt
in this city; is beautiful and accom
plished and has had educational ad
vantages. She finished at Sacred
Heart convent, this city; attended
Eden hall, in Philadelphia, and fin
ished at Miss Church's school in Bos
ton. The groom has been on several
visits to this city since the announce
ment o fthe engagement about a year
ago. He has made a host of friends
since then, who included him in their
regrets with the departure of the
young bride.
Promptly at the noon hour the
bridal party entered the church to
the strains of the bridal chorus from
"Lohengrin," played by the organist
of St. John'B Cathedral. The bride
was attended by her sister, Miss
Alice Blake, one of several lovely
sisters. The bride wore a lovely crea
tion of white satin, chiffon -and Duch
ess lace. The gown was formed of
the satin, with an overdrape of chif
fon, finished around the bottom in a
sort of harem effect. The sleeves
and girdle were of the lace. Falling
from the shoulders, and caught in at
the waistline was a train. The vail
was not long, but fell in graceful
enveloping folds to the bottom of the
gown in the back, and to the waist
line in the front. It was caught to
her coiffure with orange blossoms.
The only ornament worn was a la
valliere ot pearls and diamonds, set
in platinum, . a gift from the groom,
who brought it from Paris during
his service with the United States
army. She carried white roses.
Miss Alice Blake wore a combina
tion gown, of mauve and orchid-shaded
Georgette crepe, with orchid-shaded
hat, and carried orchids and pink
sweet peas". Mrs. Blake, mother of
the bride wore a handsome creation
of one of the new shades of purple
chiffon, over satin. During the cere
mony the choir rendered exquisitely
the high mass music. Bishop Edward
J. O'Dea officiated and the best man
was Mr. Henry Farnum of New
Haven, Conn., a graduate of the class
of '17 of Yale, a classmate of the
groom's. The ushers were Mr. Sydney
Peters, Mr. Gilbert Black and Mr.
Charles Donahue. The attendance at
the cathedral was confined to inti
mate friends, and following the cere
mony, the younger set went on to
the home of Mrs. Blake. There a pro
fusion of flowers, with hydrangeas
predominating, gave additional wel
come to the guests. Among the. out-of-town
guests at the ceremony were
Capt. William Brophy and Mrs. Brophy
and Miss Elenita Brophy, parents and
sister of the groom, of Bisbee, ' who
arrived yesterday morning for the
wedding. They are guests at the New
Washington hotel.
Mr. Brophy received his discharge
from the .United States army two
months ago, having received a com
mission of a lieutenant. He was sta
tioned at Camp Lewis anl went across
with the 91st division, coming back
with the 346th, again to Camp Lewis,
With his bride, he left for a trip
which will extend wherever fancy
takes them, until September 1, when
they will make their home in Arizona,
either in Bisbee or Phoenix to be de
cided later. The bride traveled in a
black moire suit, with a black, Milan
straw hat. Mr. Blake; father of the
bride, unfortunately, could not be
present: at the 'wedding, for he Is in
Red Cross service in Warsaw, Po
land. ..
SOLDIERS AT EL PASO
RE-ENLISTING RAPIDLY
: EL PASO, May 9. Orders were re
ceived at district military headquar
ters here today to replace all soldiers
doing non-military duty with civilian
employes wherever possible. This is
said to be a part of the war depart
ment's plan . for discharging all draft
and emergency soldiers as soon as
possible to prevent a blanket -dis
charge of all such soldiers when the
peace treaty is signed. Orders to
conduct an intensive recruiting cam
paign' within the army to retain many
of the men in the service was also
ordered by the war department. Many
.enlisted men in this district, especial
ly among the Eighth Cavalry in the

JUAREZ, Mex., May 9. An anti

the Chinese quarter here today and-resulted
in a conference of Chinese,
Mexican and American officials this
afternoon. The proclamations were
dated ' at Maddalena, Sonora, and
charged all Chinese in Mexico with
various crimes. Chew Look, leading
Chinese merchant, appealed to Amer
ican consul E. A. Dow for protection
for the Chinese colony in the absence
of a Chinese consul. The appeal was
referred to the Juarez officials, who
promptly promised the orientals pro
tection. The origin of the anti-Chinese
proclamation is unknown, but is
believed to be the work of Villa
agents.

MINES FIND WAY
TO ASSIST QUOTA
OF VICTORY LOAN
Officials of Phelps Dodge
Make Special Personal
Subscriptions
BISBEE, May 9. The inability of
the copper mining companies to sub
scribe as heavily as usual to the Vic
tory loan is causing the mining com
munities dimculty in living up to
their quotas, as their quotas are large
ly based upon the amounts raised in
the other four loans.
With the copper companies the prob
lem Is now the conservation of cash, j
in oraer that operations may be main
tained and their employes given con
tinuous work. They are facing a se
rious situation in the production of
copper without a ready market,' and
in sonie cases the production at a cost
higher than- the present market value.
Until this situation is relieved by a
sale of the copper, there will be mil
lions of dollars tied up in the red
metal.
Had the companies subscribed as
heavily as formerly to the Victory
loan, it would have meant further
curtailing of operations, more men
out of employment, and a general de
crease of prosperity.
The officials of the Phelps Dodge
corporation have found a way of over
coming thi3 difficulty and yet of as
sisting the various communities in
which the company operates to meet
their quotas, by alloting a percent
age of their personal subscriptions
to the credit of these communities.
These subscriptions are in addition to
the amounts subscribed by them in
New York city, and are as follows:

Up to You, Mr. Citizen.
What are you going to do about it?
We speak of the Victory Liberty Loan campaign. It
' is lagging in the Warren District; it is perilously near the
failure point and the name of the Warren District is in "
the balance.
The quota for this district has been set at $800,000,
. considerably under the quota in the last or fourth drive.
This district has raised little more than one-half its allot
ment to date.
Every other drive has been oversubscribed in the di3-
trict. The fourth loan, with a larger quota, the third,
second and first, were largely over-purchased. The
Warren District did more than its buying quota in War
Savings stomps.
We now face failure in the final test. Will we permit
failure we who never in the past have known the word
"can't?" Will we be found wanting in the last call of
the government for assistance in the war?
Yesterday press reports indicated that Germany is re
calcitrant, that the arroagnce of the Hun is unaffected,
that threat to break over the traces and refuse the peace
terms is made in Berlin.
The war is not over. It will not be concluded until
peace 'has actually been signed. Until that time the
emergency will continue to exist, and the duty of the peo
ple to the government will continue paramount to all
other calls and all other issues. The Victory Liebrty
Loan is by far the most important and most imperative of
any calls on the peoples finances yet issued.
And the Warren District lags faces failure.
What are you goin gto do about it?
Its up to you, Mr. Citizen, Mr. Individual!
Today is the last day of the drive !
Roads and Thrift
Much is being said just now of the importance of economy, public
and prfvate. The tax burdens resulting from the war are extremely
heavy and rest upon almost everyone whether he be capitalist or wagc
earnerl Also, there are Liberty Bonds which all of us must buy. Most '
people buy11 them on the installment plan, which means enforced thrift'
and careful economy. .
The problems of reconstruction have demand furtner public expendi
tures by states and counties and cities in providing public work to take
up the slack employment resulting from industrial readjustments. So
the city of Bisbee shouldered $200,000 of paving bonds. Most of that
money will be spent in paving a portion of one of the principal highways
of the county and should properly have been provided for by the county
as a whole. The aw so provides. Yet Bifbee decided to-shoulder that
load.
The Board of Supervisors thought the county ought to do something
along this line. First they proposed a $750,000 bond issue, then raised it
to $1,000,000 and finally to $1,250,000. Of course Bisbee will pay the
greater part of those bonds, in addition to the $200,000 of paving bonds,
but Bisbee made no kick.
The county hd one highway commission, consisting of J. J. Bowen
and Gera!d Sherman of Bisbee, Harry A. Clark and W. M. Adamson of
Douglas, and A. H. Gardner of Tombstone. That commission has served
and is serving without pay. Every unprejudiced person must admit that
it is a particularly able and well qualified commission. It employs a
highway engineer, J. C. Ryan, whose excellen.ee as a road builder is too
well known to need comment here. The highway engineer has his engi
neering organization the commission necessarily maintains some clerical
organization. All of that costs money, but it is necessary. The commis
sion is doing and has done splendid work.
But the recent legislature deoided that members of County High
way Commissions should be paid a sahjy of ten dollars per day. Prob
ably the present commission could not draw that pay because, as wo un
derstand it, the legislature carurot increase their salaries during their
present term.
So the Board of Supervisors appoint a new Commission of five mem
bers, leaving l:isbee off the rijap. These new Commissioners can draw
ten dollars each per day. They will appoin. another Highway Engineer.
The county will then have, a County Engineer and two Highway Engi
neers on its pay-roll with such assistants, etc., as they may need. The
ned Commission will maintain and office, probably at Wilcox- or Bowie,
where office rents are high. And that will cost more money. The new
Highway Engineer will need an automobile. Automobiles also cost
money.
All of this makes food for thought. It shows how roads are built and
indicates in a small way how the wind is blowing, and how our tax
moneys and bond monies give employ ment to the unemployed.
And, speaking of the unemployed, they seem to be scarce in this
county, just now. We understand that it is difficult to find men who are
willing to work on the road.s now under construction in this county.

This means that actulil con3t;uction
on the new highway will be started at;
?an early date. The Gila county super
visors held, a lengthy discussion of

PHOENIX OPERA MAD

the vehicle being "Robin Hood," and

of Mrs. J. E. Brane, Jr., is here oh a
visit. Mr. Folsom is a resident of
Naco, on the southern border of the
state. In that littl etown of bu; a few
. hundred souls life became rather
f strenuous in the troublous days before
Germany got busy on a somewhat
larser scale. Fifty-one people were
killed in and near Naco by shots from
the Mexican side, and at least Mr.
Folsom, who was justice of the peace
at the time, wired the governor that
he was going to quit holding inquests.
It became dangerous for juries to con
gregate. But few houses in Naco fail
to show the marks of bullets, and they
are specially numerous in the school
buildings.

what disposition shall be made of the
vessels. No hint has yet been given
as to the other conditions of the
treaty.
Meanwhile, the German peace dele
gation at Versailles continues its for
midable task, of digesting the peace
terms handed to it Wednesday by
Fremier Clemenceau. According to
reports originating from a high Bri
tish source in Paris, the delegates
are divided in their views on the dras
tic conditions laid down.
Hun Feeling Runs High
Feeling apparently is running high
in Germany over what is termed the
severity of ' the peace terms and a
review of the opinion in Berlin says
that the people are discussing the
consequences of a possible refusal to
sign the treaty.
"Rather anarchy than slavery," is
the remark heard on all sides, the
review declares. .
One newspaper credits Herr Gies

the only immediate solution is a peace
with Russia and the employment or

figures, to respect all facts and to. re
consider any statement or conclusion
in the light of further knowled?. Its
mind has been open and its purpose
'was directed not to winning a con

Industry Board Praised "
Mr. Redfield paid high tribute to
the board's work in a letter to Chair
man Peek.
"You have not sought to control,
but to co-operate," he said. "You have
exhausted the resources of courtesy.
Your attitude has been unselfish, gen

tion was accompanied by the senti
ment "to hell with 'Big Bill' Thomp
son." John P. Cumniings ' of Chicago re
plied to Mr. Herbert, urging the dele
gates not to impute the patriotism of
6p,000 Chicagoans who rallied to the
flag; because the city had a "mayor of
which it was ashamed."
Colonel Luke Lee of Tennessee,
later offered a resolution declaring the
rejection of Chicago was not meant as
a reflection on th epatriotism of its
loyal citizens. This was carried
unanimously.
Pittsburg St. Louis and San Fran
cisco were among other cities endeav
oring to obtain the coming convention.
Seattle Club Barred
The soldiers and sailors' council of
Seattle, Wn., was barred from the or
ganization on the ground that its mem
bership contained I. W. W. and other
so-called radicals. It was informed
that many of its members would be
be welcomed by the legion, but that
they first must sever connection with
the club.
Sergeant Sherman Curtin, repre
senting the club, reclared it was en
deavoring to clean out the I. W. W.
and bolsheviki."
He was both hissed and chered at
times, but his credentials were dis-i
credited.
The caucus today elected Private
P. C. Calhoun ,a marine of Bridge
pert, Conn., third vice chairman and
passed several minor resolutions, in-
luding one urging support of the Vic
tory Liberty loan.
The caucus is scheduled to close to
morrow, but the slowness with which
the various questions have been
handled may make another day necessary.

If ycu have been in' 'the least inclined to dciibt that BIG 4
ris QUICKLY Perhaps SUDDENLY Going over the TOP
just consider a FEW of the things that BIG 4 is DOING and
some of the ADVANCES in Big 4's Property Valuations.
JUST LET these FEW FACTS SINK IN and THEN take
warning IN TIME and GET your BIG 4 ORDERED.
BIG 4 h DRILLING in Block 45, west of Burkburnett. Near
that particular property are these SENSATIONAL wells
the BURK-WAGGONER, the UNITED, the GOLDEN
CYCLE, THE THRIFT. No. 2. Other wells EXPECTED
in ANY MOMENT are in BLOCKS 52, 46 and 63. The
GREATEST DISTANCE of ANY of THEM from BIG 4s
property is LESS than a MILE and-MOST of THEM a
HEAP CLOSER.
And inside of 30 days two MORE BIG 4 wells will be started
in the SAME GENERAL LOCALITY. BIG 4 has every
chance to BRING IN A PRODUCER in a LITTLE WHILE
Maybe, in THIRTY DAYSV
Down: by the Iowa Park property of 1 0 acres, several wells
are ON THE SAND and 1 2 deep test wells are going down.'
Big 4's lease is MOUNTING in VALUE. WORTH MORE
every DAY.
Then those 40 acres in Jack. County. Only 1-4 mile away
the Hudson & Jackson Syndicate are drilling at 600 feet and
expect to strike at 900 feet. This property is worth FIVE
TIMES what BIG 4 paid and should soon be worth a HUNDRED TIMES.
Down in BROWN COUNTY, BIG 4's 41' acres are NOW WORTH TEN TIMES
the PRICE PAID. BIG 4 has a BONANZA there. Somewhere between a mile
and a half and three miles the BAILEY & SINCLAIR wells are IN. ,
TWO other properties in Brown and Mills counties are worth FIVE -TIMES the
PRICE PAID and A DRILLING CONTRACT must go with any 'part of it that
Big 4s2might agree to SELL at a huge profit
Down in. Section 67 in EASTLAND county Big 4 has just BOUGHT 20 ACRES
adjoining the RAY WELL, being drilled by the GULF REFINING CO. Several
OTHER tracts in the DUKEand RANGER fields will be taken up as soon as the
TITLES are passed upon by BIG 4's LEG AL ADVISERS.
When you consider that THESE THINGS are ONLY a PART. When you con
sider the SOLIDITY of BIG 4. ' When you CONSIDER the fact that ACTION of
the QUICKEST KIND is a part of BIG 4's program, you CAN READILY SEE
why Big 4 will soon tell you that THERE'S NO MORE BIG 4 for SALE. You can
see ALSO why BIG 4 is worth MORE THAN PAR THIS MINUTE.
THE PRICE NOW is $1.00 a SHARE. With ALL EARNESTNESS you are
URGED to GET THAT ORDER IN. The END will COME QUICKER than
you MAY THINK.

Dr. L. D. Ricketts, well known lo
cal mining man, wired his secre
tary in Bisbee yesterday to place
a $10,000 subscription in his name
to Bisbee's auota in the Victory
loan drive. The telegram was re
ceived in response to a telegram
sent Dr. Ricketts by J. N. Gaines,
telling him of the conditions here.
Reports from the banks during. .
the day indicated that it was pos
sible the figures in the Victory
loan for the Warren district would
reach the $400,000 mark, just one
half the quota for the Warren
district with tonight at midnight
the time set when the nation will
be called upon for Us figures in
response to America's appeal for
financial assistance.
Despite the slowness in the lo
cal district during the closing
hours reports from little Naco
down on the international bound
ary showed that hamlet still had
its guns firing regardless of the
fact that it went over the top
earlier in the week. The quota
for Naco was $10,900. Telephone
advices yesterday to central head
quarters showed that $14,100 had
been -raised up until yesterday
morning with the workers still
throwing down a barrage in a
brave attempt to bolster up the
Bisbee district during tUe last
hours of the drle. -
Chairman Gaines in speaking
of Naco'sv heroic efforts to help
stem the tide of defeat for the
Warren district said that thatlit
tle community had gone over in :
all the loans and her record was ;
still unmarred. Bisbee, loyal In
all of the other four war loans,
now faces the serious danger of
putting a black spot on her as yet
unsulllied record and it will take
great deal of hard work and indi
vidual effort to make the quota
reach even the $500,000 mark, ac
cording to Gaines. .This city has
only until tonight at midnight to
save itself, and heroic eleventh
hour methods are imperative.

received in the loan show that

BETTER THAN CALOMEL
.Thousands Have Discovered Dr.
Edwards' Olive Tablets are
a Harmless Substitute.
Dr. Edwards' Olive Tablets the substi
tute for calomel are a mild but sure
laxative, and their effect on the liver is
almost instantaneous. They are the result (
of Dr. Edwards determination not to treat
liver and bowel complaints with calomel.
His efforts to banish it brought out these
little olive-colored tablets.
These pleasant little tablets do the good
that calomel does, but have no bad after
effects. They don't injure the teeth like
strong liquids or calomel. They take hold
of the trouble and quickly correct it. Why
cure the liver at the expense of the teeth?
Calomel sometimes plays havoc with the
gums. So do strong liquids. It is best not
to take calomel, but to let Dr. Edwards'
Olive Tablets take its place.
Most headaches, "dullness" and that
lazv feeline come from constipation and
a disordered liver. Take Dr. Edwards S
Olive Tablets when you feel "loggy" and
"heavy." Note how they "clear" clouded
brain and how they "perk up" the spirits.

BY REVIEW
STOCKS AND BONDS -
NEW YORK, May . Exceeding in
activity any previous session of the
year, today's stock market duplicated
in Its chief characteristics the broad
and highly speculative movements of
the past few weeks, but . selling for
profits was more insistent, many gains
being baterially shaded or altogether
cancelled later.
The most important development of
the day, abandonment of the stabiliz
ing of steel prices, was somewhat Ob
scured by the violent fluctuations in
oils, shippings and other favorites
which contributed more than their
quota to the markets of the past two
months.
Fro mthe course of steel shares it
was evident that financial and indus
trial interests Baw no ground for ap
prehension in any open or free market
for fabricated products, some of those
issues selling at the year's highest
quotations.
United States Steel rose 1 to
101. its maximum since the passage
of the extra common dividend, but
forfeited half its gain.
Texas company again featured the
oils at a further advance of 22
points to 292, Royal Dutch, Mexican
Petroleum, Pan-American Petroleum,
American Woolen, Montana Power,
United Fruit and Atlantic Gulf were 5
to 9 points higher at one time, but the
latter closed unchanged. Sales amount
ed to 1,800,000. shares. .
Bonds, notably secondary rails and
foreigns were ; strong with an easier
tendency for ' Liberty . issues.' Total
sales, par value; aggregated $12,400,
000. Old' United States bonds .were
unchanged on call. .

THE GRAIN MARKETS
CHICAGO, May 9. Bearish senti
ment, due largely to the government
crop report, made the corn market to
day average lower. Prices closed un
settled at 3c net decline to c ad
vance, with July $1.634. to $1.63 and
September $1.55"to $1.55. Oats fin
ished lc off toec gain, and provi
sions unchanged to 65c down.
Weakness of corn did not include
May delivery, which was governed by
the scantiness of receipts and by keen
demand in the sample market. On the
other band, July, and eSptember con
tracts were under heavy selling pres
sure throughout the day not only as
a result of the government crop re
port, but also in view, of a sharp break
in the hog market and because of no
tice that 4,000,000 bushels of Canadian
wheat would be Imported by the Unit
ed States Instead of the 1,000,000
bushels announced three days ago.
Oats merely reflected the changes
in corn.
Provisions were depressed with
hogs and grain. ; . Chances of smaller
receipts of hogs next week, however,
caused some reaction.

KEPT HER AWAKE
The Terrible Pains in Back and
Sides. Cardui Gave Relief.
, Mariaville, La. Mrs. Alice Johnson,
of this place, writes: "For one year 1
suffered with an awful misery in my back
md sides. My left side was hurting me
all the time. The misery was something
twfuL
I could not do anything, not even sleep
it night It kept me awake most of the
night ... I took different medicines, but
nothing did me any good or relieved me
until I took Cardui ...
I was not able to do any of my work
lor one year and I got worse all the time,
was confined to my bed off and on. I got
10 bad with my back that when I stooped
down I was not able to straighten up
again ... I decided I would try Cardui
... By time I had taken the entire bottle
I was feeling pretty good and could
ttraighten up and my pains were nearly
ill gone.
I shall always praise Cardui. I con
finued taking it until 1 was strong and
well." If you suffer from pains due to
female complaints, Cardui may be just
what you need. Thousands of women
tiho once suffered in this way now praise
Cardui for their present good health.

THOMPSON'S FINE
RURAL PLAY HELD
STAGE 30 YEARS
Remarkable Success Achieved by "The
Old Homestead" Now
Picturized
When Ueuman Thompson wrote
"The Old Homestead" 40 years agohe
little dreamed of the prodigious suc
cess it would achieve. The famous
play held the stage continuously for
more than 30 years and more than
20,000,000 of Americans saw it at one
time or another.
This famcud play has been pictur
ized by Paramount and it will be
shown at the Lyric theater today. It
is an admirable photoplay and one
that will live long in the memory
or all who see it.
"lne Old Homestead" is a rich
and therefore rare combination of
good" old-fashioned rural comedy and
the deepest pathos. .Opening in the
peaceful farm country far from the
glare and blare of Broadway, the story
takes the innocent son from this hap
py abode and flings him into the
maelstrom of New York's life. Here
he falls victim to the lure of the
new existence and nearly breaks the
heart of his grieving family.
But his simple -old father, putting
all his trust and faith in the power
of good over evil, goes to the city
in search of his son, confident that
he will be guided to him by a Higher
Intelligence. The pathos and dramatic
force of the scenes which follow are
founded upon the most effective of
all appeals heart-interest.
Frank Losee, who is well known all
ovep the United States for his mar
velous character acting, plays Josh
Whitcomb, the role made memorable
by Denman Thompson. Others in the
cast include Creighton Hale, Den
man Moley,. Louise Huff and Mrs.
Corbett. " . Adv.

The Bisbee team will be one of the
four teams which is expected to make

which probably will perfect organiza
tion within the next two weeks. Oth
er teams in the league, as plans now
stand, will be the C. & A. organization

of
two local teams will be especia.lly an
ticipated by local residents who are
aligning themslvos with either the
Bisbee or the Lowell club as rooters
and Doosters.
That the games will be sufficiently
interesting and hotly contested is the
assurance of the managers of the var
ious clubs who are making every ef
fort to secure for their teams the best
players available. With the release
from tne army and navy of many
good players, it is expected that no
difficulty will be encountered in get
ting stars enough to make four well
balanced teams. It is with this espe
cially in miud that the league has
been started during this season, ac
cording to those who are behind it.
Ryan, who heads the Bisbee team,
is an experienced baseball fan. He
was at one time a well-known player
on local and state-wide diamonds, and
for many years was the official umpire
for the Warren district. Egan has had
experience in the game as an execu
tive. He was secretary-treasurer of
the Tri-State League, Albuquerque
club, a . few years ago when that
league launched forth one of the best
western playing schedules ever start
ed. The members of the board of di
rectors are all interested in the game,
are good fans, and -will assist in every
way possible in making the league and
their club a success.
RED GROSS ATTENTION
TURNED TO ASSISTING
OF RETURNING TROOPS
At a meodng held in Tucson last
week by the various stale chapters
of the Red Cross it was decided that
production, such as the knitting of
sweaters and socks during the war,
he virtually suspended but held ready
to answer any emergency call that
might arise, according to Mrs. G. J.
McCabe, assistant secretary local Red
Cross Chapter, who attended the con
ference as one of the delegates from
this ci';y.
During the war most of the fac
tories were occupied in producing
materiels 'and as a result the govern
ment practically depended on the wo
men of the country for all-extra gar
ments and bandages needed by tha
ligluing forces during the war.
It was also decided at the confer
ence that the home service depart
ments would be enlarged and its ac
tiv'itias would continue as long as
there are soldiers and soldiers' fam
ilies to be given information and
help.
INTEREST SHOWN IH

The sale of seats for "A Bolshevik
Dream," which is to be presented at

HOSPITAL ESCAPE IS
GIVEN FREEDOM ONLY
TO BE RE-ARRESTED
When J. W. Johnson, also known
as Thos. Densmore, charged with vio
lating the vice laws, was given his
release temporarily pending" the de
cision of Judge J. L. Winters yes
terday afternoon, he was immediate
ly -re-arrested by Deputy Sheriff Tom
Foster? following ? instructions re
ceived from I. Tinklepaugh of the de
partment of justice at Douglas, who
wants him on a charge of crossing the
line at Naco under an assumed name,
according to the federal officials.
Johnson and Mrs. Carl Richardson,
jointV charged, were given their re
lease but were to appear in the Lo
well court at 2 o'clock this afternoon
to hear the verdict of Judge Winters.
As Johnson was leaving the court
room he was placed under arrest by
Officer Foster, who said he had orders
to detain him for federal officers. A
verbal battle then ensued between At
torney S. K. Williams, who is defend
ing the couple, and deputy sheriffs.
However, Johnson was again placed in
jail. It is understood that Tinkle
paugh will arrive , in Lowell this
this morning with the warrant for
Johnson.
It is alleged by the immigration of
ficers at Naco that Johnson was given
a temporary permit to cross the line
last Monday and that he gave the
name of "Mr. Scott." When he re
crossed the line he was arrested by
Officer Foster for violating the vice
laws in Lowell. . .
Since Johnson . was found in a
critical condition, the result of being
cut with a razor three weeks ago,
he has been in trouble. Mrs. Carl
Richardson who was accused of cut
ting Johnson, was placed under ar
rest but because Johnson, who man
aged to escape from the hospital, fail
ed to appear against her she was re
leased but was later arrested and
charged with violating the vice laws.
