WASHINGTON, Mar. 20. Early
recognition by the United States of
the new government set up by revolu
tion in Russia was forecast here to
day in the belief that, with good or
der now prevailing the plans being
made for a permanent constitutional
government call for the moral support
of this country. All reports to the
state department indicate that the.
army and navy are supporting the
provisional government
U. S. Diplomat Reports
Ambassador Francis at Petrograd
summarized the situation today In
the following cablegram:
"The last week has seen the most
astonishing revolution. Two hundred
millionpeople who have lived under
absolute monarchy for 1,000 years and
who are now engaged in the greatest
war in history have forced their em
peror to abdicate for himself and his
son and induced the brother to whom
was transfered imperial authority, to
accept on condition that a constitu
tional assembly of the people will ex
ercise power of authority of govern
ment All Russia Quiet
"No opposition to provisional gov
ernment which is by council of minis
ters appointed by committee of 12
named by the Duma. Absolute quiet
here and throughout all Russia. Rod
zianko and Milukolf assure me whole
army and navy in support Every-1
thing learned from unofficial sources
confirms.
"Plan of provisional government is
to call constituent assembly or con
vention whose members be elected by
whole people and who be empowered
to organize good goverment Whether
republic or constitutional monarchy
undecided, but conclusions of assem
bly will be accepted by the people and
enforced by army and navy."
Republic Pleases U. S.
The United States always looks
with favor upon a movement for the
extension of republicanism and has
been eager to be among the first to
welcome into the family of nations
new governments known to be found
ed upon the will of the people.
The Russian movement consequent
ly has been received with deep sym
pathy here where the quality of the.
present leaders is well known and
highly esteemed. As yet no official
action has been taken because it is
not known that the revolutionary
movements set in motion have entire
ly quieted down into a stable govern

"We have no coast defenses

which a hostile power could land
troops on our shores has been re

No Weapons of War
"Our regular organizations lack
many things which are vitally
essential in modern war. We lack
grenades and bombs. We are
without trench mortars of the
type in use in Europe. We are
without various kinds of field sig
nal apparatus. We are short of
modern field wireless. We ape
without any of the modern types
of heavy mobile artillery such as
is in general use In Europe.

And the Monroe Doctrine fails, if it
is ignored with a German naval sta

Mr. Root said the letter of Foreign

Mexico proposing an alliance of Mex

COPPER QUEEN
LOSES NAME IN
ilENT
Phelps, Dodge and Company's
Great Mining Company Has
Its Name Changed to Phelps
Dodge Corporation.
According to documents filed with
the Arizona Corporation Commission,
a reorganization and unification of
Phelps, Dodge t & Company and its
subsidiaries has been effected. Through
proper action of the authorities of
New York state, under the laws of
which the Copper Queen Consolidated
Mining company is organized, that
company has changed its name, and
will henceforth be known as the
Phelps Dodge Corporation, and it will
now become the owning and operating
company for various important mining
enterprises in Arizona and New Mex
ico, heretofore owned and operated by
separate subsidiary companies of
Phelps, Dodge & Company.
According to the statements of
company officials, this step merely
concerns the internal organization of
Phelps Dodge interests and does not
foreshadow an increase of 'outstand
ing capital, or purchase of additional
property, or any other matter external
to the corporation. Primarily, it
marks or foreshadows the elimination
of the holding company. Heretofore,
Phelps, Dodge & Company, a corpora
tion, has held the capital stock of
various subsidiary operating compa
nies, which will now be brought Into
direct ownership and operation by a
single company.
This change is made In deference
to the growing attitude of public
opinion toward holding companies, and
to harmonize with legislative tenden
cies and enactments in that direction.
Also, and in an Important degree, the
change is designed to simplify the
management and operation or the vari
ous properties and to avoid complicat
ed and expensive duplication ot ac
counts which was necessarily incident
to the holding company system. In
short, it is a mere reorganization of
the Phelps, Dodge companies without
change in holdings, Ownership or of
ficials, and is Intended primarily to
promote efficiency and efrmrrcny.

!CEW YORK. Mar. 30. The many
additional advances registered today
were accompanied by another very
large volume of business in which
signs of a re-awakenins of public in

fact that one stock, 1'nitetl Slates

percent of the total detracted in a
measure from the impressiveness ol
the rise.

CHICAGO, Mar. 20. Profit taking
sales overcame all advances in the
wheat market today. There appeared
to be virtually unlimited quantities
awaiting purchase above 1S8 for May.
The result was an unsettled close,
half to 17m net lower, with May' at
1.86n to l.SS-v and July at 1.57VS to
l.f7s. Corn finished unchanged to
at higher, oats off to V, up.
and provisions at a rise of 5 to 15c.
Bearish crop advices from the
southwest did a good deal to induce

construed as a factor against higher
prices and there was word from Min
neapolis of liberal offerings of Cana
dian wheat.
Despite numerous sharp rallies the
wheat market leaned more and more
oward a lower level in the last half
of the session. Apparent absence of
any urgent export demand acted fur-'
ther as a weight on the market as
dealings came to an end.
Scarcity of rural offerings sent rorn
to the hir;he?t level on record number

leaders checked the advance. Oats
showed much independent strength.

There's no other corn-remover in

Don't forget that fact. "Gets-It" does

RICHARD HARDING

"Somewhere in France," Writ

Writer, Will be Offered ac
the Central Theatre, Today, j
J. C. Hawks, who made the screen !
adaptation of the late Ric hard Hard- '
iug luvis' -jiiicm here in France."'
which appears today at tht Central,
in which Thomas II. Ince presents
Louise Glaum and Howard Hickman
011 the Triangle program, tells an
niniising story of how he otu e ordered
lmis oil the stage of the old HelaSi-o
Theatre in New York City.
Hawks at the tlm, was stage man-.-cer
for David Eelasi-i. and one nieht
luring tiif seiVnid act of a now produc
tion he observed a stranger immacu
lately dressed in evening clothe. and
all in all presented the appearance of
a man of wealth and refinement. Hut
this did not "cut any lemons" with
Hawks, who believed in adhering
strictly to his rules. So he walked
quietly up to the stranger and inquired
his identity.
"Don't you know who I am?" asked
the stranger.
"I do not." retorted Hawks.
"Well. I am Mr. Davis." responded
:he n'.)ted author.
"I can't help that." said Hawks
"Who gave you permission to come be
hind the stage?"
"Why. Mr. Belasco. of course!" gent
ly returned Davis.
Then a great light dawned upon
Hawks. And he suddenly concluded
that the "Mr. Davis" was none other
than Pichard Harding Davis, author
of the book, the adaptation of which
was being presented on that very
stage. Then he apologized, and the
two became warm friends.

PEARSON AND $10,000.
A. C. Pearson, better known as "Art" to nearly every-
one In Cochise county. Is good subject matter. The prin
cipal question at Issue between Pearson and, we firmly
believe, everyone who knows him, is:
"Is Pearson worth either $5,000 or $1 0,000 ?r
Now, be it known. Art Pearson has been resident of
Cochise county fcr a good many years (when he couldn't
secure something 'easy' in Phoenix). He Is known for
his ability as a converter man, a promoter, curb-stone
broker, candidate for office in any primary, handy man
about - polling places, and in them, and, last but not
least, for his ability to talk himself out of more good
jobs than any other man who has Inhabitated this region
of the state.
Pearson, according to his own testimony in the contest
proceedings in Phoenix on Monday, was deeply offence
when accused of having tampered with certain ballots
in a voting precinct in Douglas. He was maligned, cba
grined, hurt and his feelings will never get over it. (Nor
will his reputation.) The great factor in his testimony
with which be takes a decided exception is that he was
offered $5,000 and had that amount raised to $10,000
Two designing, horrid, (and if it can be true) stupid
detectives offered Art $10,000 for his silence, for his ab
pence, if you will, from Arizona.
Art is one of the most engaging fellows in the world
if he don't engage you for any length of time. He is a
nice fellow, who prefers leisure to' work. In fact, slnre
he worked for one of t$e Douglas smelters, he has ret
been known to seriously contemplate doing anything
except 'get by. In fact Art has a penchant for 'getting
by' in devious and sundry ways. A remarkable' thin
about Art is that he always has lots of time and advice
and 'sure things' and a manner which is hard to evade.
But $10,000 Is a lot of money!
Now our friend Art appears hurt to think that anyone
would go so far as to accuse him of anything that might
aid one candidate or another, in an election after the
ballots have been cast. He is also sorry that anything
along this line should have come to the surface. His
reputation' will suffer!
$10,000 is a lot of money!
Art claims to have been envigled into some kind of an
engagement with a detective in Silver City, while he was
on his way to Phoenix to appear as a witness in the
contest Incidentally, it is a funny thing that Art had
to go to Silver City in order to get into Arizona. Silver
City, if tie map be studied, is a good ways off any main
line entering Arizona. In the New Mexico town Arthur
was induced to drink whiskey (horrid stuff) by that
designing detective. He says he was forced to get drunk
and nearly accepted a big bribe. He didn't want to do it
and his conscience finally prevailed and he returned to
Douglas without the filthy lucre which was offered him.
$10,000!
Great shades of Judas have pity on us. If we did no;
know him so well; if it were not our engaging, soft-peddling,
long-talking. Insinuating, office-seeking, designing,
Arthur! If it only were someone who were, worth the
price! Then we would bow our heads any say "It is
possible" but Art with his double-decked, method of
approach and retreat!
Why Pearson would try one "Jolt" where Gunga Din
is presiding with his goat skin water bag for $10,000!
FINGER-PRINTS FOR EVERYBODY.
Somebody suggests that every person ought to be finger
rinted according to the Bertillon system. Not that he
proposes putting every man, woman and child of us in a
"rogues' gallery." There would be no criminal connota-,
tion whatever about the process, as there Is at present.
The idea is simply this:
If finger-prints afford such an unerring method of
identyfying criminals, why would they not be just as val
uable for identifying who ever needs Identification. We
have cases every day of unknown dead suicides or mur
der victims or victims of accident whose identity might
be discovered if their finger-prints were registered and
catalogued. W evahoerpesns'.TtusY asespollon esifiyy
catalogued. We have persons whose minds have failed
them and who have forgotten their names. We have
lost and deserted children. We have legal disputes ever
the identity of heirs. If public authorities had prints of
everybody's fingers, taken in childhood and again per
haps in mature life, many such troubles might be avoided.
It is pointed out, too, that finger-prints are more valu
able than signatures that they are. In fact, the surest
sort of signatures. Why shouldn't we sign legal docu
ments with the tips of our fingers, along with our written
signatures? Why shouldn't banks and insurance com
panies have finger-prints on record?? There couldn't be
any forgery then.
TAKE AND INTEREST!
Again the matter of our schools should be brought be
fore the people of the Warren District On Saturday,
March 24. a bond election will be Jield for the purpose of
voting $100,000 for the maintenance and further enlarge
ment of the facilities for the education of the children if
this region.
The people of the District should appreciate the fact
(hat our schools are the keystone of the future of this
and every other community in the country. Only when
something occurs that is displeasing does any consider
able part of the p.Mple take an interest in the schools
then it is negative. The time is coming, no it is here,
when the people should look closer to things which effect
tlM-tft most. .That thing is the school.
' Thlise who are entitled to vote, should come to the,
polls on Saturday and express their opiniou on the school
bonds.
, Incidentally, it should 1m- in approval of the issue. The
schools need imd demand enlargement.
A CONFIDENT TURK.
For tip-top optimism, we must commend Enver Pasha,
the ruling power in Turkey. A dispatch from Constantin
ople quotes him as saying that the Turkish military situa-
ion is better than at any time since Turkey's entrance
into the war.
"For military reasons" the Turks have "retired north
ward on the Mesopotamian frpnt" For similar reasons
they have "drawn In toward KermanshaJi, on the Persian
front" But "we and our allies await with calm and con
fidence any offensive which the enemy may launch in the
coming spring. The safety of the Turkish coast and the
Dandanelles is better assured than ever before. The
-vhole outlook justified confidence in the future. Thanks;
o the Almighty, we shall obtain the victory."

CHARGE FOR DELIVERY.
The town of Austin, a suburb of Chicago, has a new
device to lower the cost of provisions, for the benefit t
those who care about the same to go to a little trouble.
The grocers have figured out that delivering goods cosU?
them, an average, five cents per order. They have there
fore agreed to make a flat charge of five cents for every
delivery. Thus customers taking their own purchases
home will save a nickel.
It may look on the face of it. as if those grocers have
merely bit on a new plan to raise prices. But they main
tain that they expect to make no more by it that it's
only a device by which they may distribute expenses
equitably. They say that by charging for delivery they
can lower their prices, thus enabling the housewives who
do their own marketing to effect a real saving.
They also 'agree to charge an extra cent for charging
every older, thus giving a slight advantage to customers
who pay cash and making possible a six-cent saving for
every trip to the store.
The idea is no doubt worth copying. In large cities,
where delivery wagons must cover a greater distance, a
greater saving should be possible. .
Every merchant knows what a large part of his ex
penses is due to the delivery of goods.' In 'the case of
small purchases, the delivery often costs as much as the
goods are worth. There ought to be a fair adjustment of ,
the burden. Delivery Is a useful and important pare of!
the mercbantlle business, but those who benefit by ft
should pay for it and those who do their own delivering;
should be compensated.

"DRIVE-AWAY" AUTOS.
There is one big American industry that has stopped
worrying about the rsllway problem. Freight traffic may
become congested by export shipments or strikes, but
the automobile factories can deliver their product just
the same. , !
It has just recently dawned on the manufacturers that
if a car is good for anything, it can deliver itself. It can
run from the factory to tlie selling agent or the ultimate
j purchaser under its own power. Orders are now beiug
taken in the big motor-csr tenters on the "drive-away"
basis. Cars are delivered thus from Detroit and other
Michigan cities, over a wide area. Recently 62 cars
were taken in oue "drove" from Cleveland to Chicago.
It is expected that with the coming of summer deliveries
will be made for much greater distance. It is a sun
method, and in many caes it is cheaper than shipping
the cars by rail. ' '' ' ; .' 1
This innovation is a reminder, loo, of the possibilitie
of the motor car as a factor in our national system of
transportation. At any time our parscuprr autoH ami
motor trucks might be used to carry passengers and
freight and relieve overburdened or disabled railroads.

Quartermaster Webber De
clares Uncle Sam's Navy
Offer Many Advantages to
Men Who Wish to Enlist
Now. '
Chief Quartermaster C. F. Webber.
Of the United States navy, yesterday
opened up a naval recruiting office in
the Copper Queen dispensary building
and Is prepared to recruit any Bisbee
men between the a sea of 17 and 30
who desire to Join the navy. Quar
termaster Webber came here from
Douglas,- where he signed up 30 husky
boys who passed the physical and
mental examinations with high stand
ings. "The United States navy offers more
to the young man today than ever be
fore." said Webber yesterday. "Every
man has a 'chance to rise from the
ranks and become an officer and ev
ery man is offered an excellent oppor-
tunlty for travel and education, with
good salaries being paid In every
branch of the service. I have travel
ed considerably over the southwest
and in every city I have visited I have
found many young men who have
served in the navy, and every one is
making good in his present position.
I consider that the - navy training
which they had is greatly responsible
for their success now, for the navy is
the best place in the world to bring
out the good qualities of any young
man. The requirements for enlist
ment in tbe navy are growing more
strict every year, probably due to the
fact that so many young men are en-
listing, but I hope to meet many
young men in this district who will
pass the examination."
Physician at the Copper Queen
dispensary yesterday promised to co
operate with Quartermaster Webber
while he is bee.

Did you ever consider what a dif
ference there is in biscuits, cake,
muffins, etc., made with Royal
Baking Powder and those made
with cheaper baking powders
containing alum or phosphate ?
Royal Baking Powder is made with
Cream of Tartar derived from grapes, a
delicious, healthful fruit and that is why
it produces food of superior texture,
wholesomeness and keeping quality.
Alum and phosphate arc derived from
mineral acids, and the only reason for
using such substitutes for Cream cf
Tartar is because their cost is very
much less to the manufacturer.
Remember this when buying baking

After this Pearson's answers were
enigmatic and ambiguous.
Tbe witness was asked if he left
Douglas of bis own accord and replied
that he left Feb. 6 on a vacation.
Judge Campbell then asked if a letter

membered receiving a letter about
that time but could not remember
what it contained: whether it referred
to the alleged fraud in Douglas No.

Pearson's memory also failed when
questioned regarding the date of the

when he learned that he was a fugitive

it mentioned his name, whether Doug

long it was and what the article con

SAGE TEA KEEPS
YOURHAIR DARK
It's Grandmother's recipe to
bring back color, youthful
ness and lustre Every
body is using it again.
Gray hair, however handsome, de
notes advancing age. We all know the
advantages of a youthful appearance.
Your hair is your charm. It makes or
mars the face. When it fades, turns
gray and looks streaked, just a few
applications of Sage Tea and Sulphur
enhances Us appearance a hundred
fold. Don't stay gray! Look young! Either
prepare the recipe at home or get from
any drug store a 50-cent bottle of
"Wyeth's Sage and Sulphur Com
nound," which Is merely the fcld-time
recipe improved by the addition of
other ingredients. Thousands of folks
recommend this ready-to-use prepara
tion, because it darkens the hair beau
tifully, besides n'j one can possibly tell,
as it darkens so naturally and evenly.
You moisten a sponge or soft brush
with It, drawing this through the hair,
taking one small strand at a time. By
morning the pnry hair disappears;
after another application or two, its
natural color is restored and it be
comes thick, glossy and lustrous, and
you appear, years ybunger.
. Wyeth's Sage and Sulphur Com
pound Is a delightful toilet requisite.
It is not intended for the cure, mitiga
tion or prevention of disease. Adver

A Bilious Attack.
When you have a bilitms attack
your liver fails to perform its funct
ions. You become constipated. The
food you eat ferments in your stomach j
instead or digesting. This inflames the
stQmach and causes nausea, vomiting
and a terrible headache. Take Cham
berlain's Tablets. They will tone up
your liver, clean 'out your stomach and
you will soon be as well as ever. They
only cost a quarter. AdvertisemenL

ACIDS IN STOMACH
SOUR THE FOOD AND
CAUSEJNDIGESTION
Pape's Diapepsin' fixes sour,
gassy, upset stomachs
in five minutes.
You don't know what upset your
stomach which portion of the food
did the damage do you? Well, don't
bother. If your stomach is in a re
volt; if sick, gassy and upset, and
what you just ate has fermented and
turned sour; head diz?y and aches;
belch gases amd acids and eructate un
digested food; breath foul, tongue
coated just take a little Pape's Din
pepsin to neutralize acidity and in
five minutes you wonder what became
of the indigestion and distress.
Millions of men and women today
know that it is needless to have d)s
pepsia. A little Diapepsin occasional
ly keeps the stomach sweetened, and
tey eat their favorite foods without
fear.
If your stomach doesn't take care of
your liberal limit without rebellion;
if your food is a damage instead of a
help, remember the quickest, surest,
most harmless antacid is Pape's Dia
nepsin, which costs only fifty cents
for a large case at drug stores. It's
truly wonderful it stops food sour- j
ing and sets things straight, so gent
ly and easily that it is really astonish
ing. Your stomach will digest your
meals if you keep acids neutralized.
