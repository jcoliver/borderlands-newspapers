400 COLLEGES
SIGNED UP TO
Government. Is Trying to
Come to Terms With Oth
ers, That Young Men May
Be Educated ,
(Ey Reviow leased Wire)
WASHINGTON, Sept. 5. More
than 400 educational institutions
have been enlisted in the war de
partment's program for educating
at the expense of the government,
recruits who are selected as
worthy of this privilege. Tenta
tive contracts with additional col
leges are being signed.
Practically the entire first class
to be given the special courses
will be drawn from the 18 and 19
year old men who are already reg
istered at the approved institu
tions for the scholastic year be
ginning next month.
The period between October and
December will be devoted to test
ing out the plan and those stu
dents who fail to take full advant
age of their opportunity will find
themselves changing places with
other drafted men.
Selection of a recruit for special
training will mean that he will
then face one of four eventualities.
He will be found sufficiently quali
fied for detail to an officers' train
ing camp; he will be found quali
fied, hut not matured enough for
this supplementary training and
will he maintained at the school.
He will be found unqualified for
commanding troops, but qualified
for further technical training; he
will be returned to the status of a
draft registrant and will he called
in his turn. No decision has teen
reached as to whether the mili
tary regulations drawing a dry
zone around all Iraining camps
will he extended to cover these institutions.

dicted tonight by federal officials.
Two thousand government

sccres of persons known to be of

rested and questioned.
Four theories are offered by the
police to explain the outrage. First
that it was an I. W. W. plot to per
mit the escape of Wm. D. Hay
wood, secretary-treasurer of the
organization as he was in the
building at the time of the blast;
second that it was the work of a
German sympathizer; third, that it
was placed by an anarchist, and
fourth, that it was the work of a
"crank."

WASHINGTON, Sept. 5. It is
extremely unlikely that Presi

to feel that a prolonged absence

(Bv Reviow Leased Wire)
MADRID, Sept. 5. A dispatch
was received here last night from
London reporting the assassina
tion of former Russian empress
and her dauchters. but in view of
the steps taken by King Alfonso
ta'obutln the transfer to Spain of
the family of the deposed and mur
dered Russian monarch, the report
was treated with all reserve.
El Sol says the Spanish ambas
sador at Berlin conierred on the
question of removing' the former
empress and her daushters from
Russia with Ambassador Jofte, the
Russian ambassador at Berlin.
At the same time, the newspaper
says, a Spanish military medical
mission, which was In Germany
in connection with the exchange or
prisoners of war, left Germany for
Russia and that mission now is
with the ex-empress and her
daughters.
There remains only a few for
malities to complete which will
take only a few days. El Sol says,
and then the former empress and
her . children will come to Spain
on a yacht flying the Papal colors.
The Russian women will reside at
Macdalena palace at Santander.
El Sol adds that it seems diffi

Spanish government learning of

it had occurred as reported.

CHICAGO, Sept 5. "It was the first test of strength and the breaks

ever, credit is due Ruth for his wonderful pitching. The Cuba have ferreted
out the weak spots of the Red Sox and the score will tell a different story
tomorrow. I bavn't decided who I shall pitch, but it is likely to be Tyler."
We got the jump on them today and the Red Sox are confident of
repeating tomorrow." said Manager Barrow of the Boston club. "Ruth
pitched great ball and I certainly shall start him back at the Cubs when we
play in l oston. I bavn't made up my mind who I shall pitch tomorrow. It
will either be Mays or Bush. Baseball is a long way from dead, judging
on the enthusiasm' and size of today's crowd. We will even have a bigger

Concession Made When Reso

President to Set Dry Zones
By Proclamation
(By Review Leased Wire)
WASHINGTON, ept. 5 Although
the senate today adopted a resolution
authorizing the president to establish
"dry" zones around coal mines, ship
yards, munition and other war plants,
it again failed to reach a final vote
on the emergency agricultural appro
priation bill with" its rider providing
for national prohibition from July 1,
1919. until the nation's huge army Is
mustered out after the war.
The resolution for prohibition zones
about war plants was a part of the
I prohibition rider. It was adopted sep
I arately, however. Upon representations
I that the prohibition bill might be de-
layed and that the president should be
eiven the nower immediately to create
I the proposed zones. Offered by Sen-
! ator Kellogg of Minnesota, the sep
arate resolution was approved without
a roll call anj after scant debate.
Later an effort was made by Represen
tative Miller of Minnesota, to bring the
resolution before the house, but Repre
sentative Dent of Alabama, objected
and it went over.
Long discussion of the, "slacker
round-up" at New York and of the
federal trade commission and its re
port on profiteering occupied most of
the senate's time today and prevented
a vote, despite attempts of prohibi
tion champions to hasten disposal of
the measure, which has been before

These two giants fought it out

the stand was practically empty.
- In the left section there were many
vacant chairs. A number of boxes also
were without occupants, and in the
bleachers the three lower rows all
around the field were vacant.
War taxes, the high cost of living,
curtailed railroad service at advanced
prices, the weather, the curtailed sea

war were said to account for the'ln
differenec of the public. The dyed in

given over to the virtues of a certain

to "keep the glow in old glory" and tiie
right field space commanded "buy war

COMISKEY PARK. CHICAGO, Sept.
5. The Boston Red Sax won the open
ing game of the 1918 world's series
here today, defeating the Chicago Na
tionals one to nothing in a game mark
ed principally' by air tight pitching.
The winning run resulted from 'the
first of Vaughn's bases on balls, the
slip of the Chicago pitcher being fol
lowed by two sharp singles by White
man and Mclnnis, Shean scoring on
the second hit with the ouly run of
the game.
The Cubs had only two good open
ings for runs but with both of them
came with two men out. ; In the first
instance Merkle was passed, and Pick,
Chicago's new second baseman, was
unequal of the task of driving in the
runs. In the second instance. Deal
raised the hopes of the Chicago fans
by driving a long hit to left, but it" foil
p 'foul nd bis next' attempt vas cap
tured by Whiteman. The game lacked
almost all spectacular features which
i usually accompany . a world's series
conflict but this had no effect on the
Quality -of play,.-which.ws worthy of
champion teams of major leagues. The
tine pitching of the opposing left hand
ers, Vaughn and Ruth, gave the field
ers little chance for stunts and as a
consequence the crowd had alinosth no
opportunity to cheer.
Only a corporal's guard of former
world series crowds was on hand to
see the Chicago Nationals and Boston
Americans open the 1918 baseball
classic here tcday. Half an hour be
fore schedule time for the call of "play
ball" the bleachers held scarcely 7o
per cent of their capacity and the left
hand pavilion was only half filled. Taa
right field pavilion had attracted less
than 200 fans and the grandstand pa
trons always slow to assemble, were
in evidence only in scattered sections.
Weather conditions were far from
perfect, a chilly northeast wind blow
ing directly into the stands.
First Inning
First half Hooper was cheered as,
he walked to the plate. Vaughn's pitch
was a strike. Hooper bumped the
second offering down the first base
fine and was out Merkle to Vaughn.

ALLEGED GERMAN
SPY IS ARRESTED
AT BORDER CITY
DEPUTY SHERIFF SMITH FROM
NOGALES ARRIVES HERE AFT
ER PRISONER AND BRINGS
WORD OF IMPORTANT ARREST
MADE THERE .
Deputy Sheriff Smith arrived' here
Wednesday from Xogales coming for
Edward Pearce, who was arrested
here a few days ago on a charge of
bigamy for the Xogales. officers. He
states that Pearce does liot bear the
best of a reputation and had been
picked up on a number of occasions
in the border town by the United
States and officers for being impli
cated in the smuggling and handling
of hop but that he was always smooth
enough to get out.
Smith states that Ncgales is quiet
at the present time but that trouble
might break out again at any time. A
report had reached Nogales about the
time he left that there had been trou
ble and some shots fired across the
line at the United States soldiers in
the vicinity of Lochiel where there is
a small contingent stationed but it
had not been verified up to the time
that he left.
He also stated that a man named
Otto Mayer, supposed to be a German
spy, was arrested by the members of
the sheriff's office on Tuesday as he
stepped from the Tucson stage and
wtwn a search was made of his suit
cases a rifle taken down, a shot gun
and two six shooters were found in
them as well as maps showing the dif
ferent location of training camps in
the United States where the subma
rine stations were, the cities where
ship building was going on and a map
of the Atlantic showing where the
troops were embarking from as well
as a map of Mexico showing roads,
etc., leading into the United States.
It was discovered that he had been
working along the west coast and had
visited a number of places and had
been on different strips and was well
posted of the coast ports. He was
turned over to the department of jus
tice agents and his record checked
up.
Xfr. Smith stated that some of the
troops from Ft. Huachuca had return
ed to their post and that a detach
ment of the Twenty-fifth Infantry had
arrived from Honolulu to take their
place and that others were expected
to arrive within the next day or so.
Captain Wheeler and his machine gun
troop are still there.

It migh be well this payday to look
ahead a little to the future and save enough
to face the cash system soon to come. Econ
omy in these days of highwages and high
prices and .tirjusual conditions brought
about by the.war is the practical thing to
practice. And,, there is no doubt that the
cash system tends more to economy in buy
ing than is the case where one has credit,
the new plan, whatever one may think of it,
or argue, for or against, will certainly en
able the workmen to go and buy goods
where they can get them cheapest. It will
make them more independent. It will
check it to them to establish their own
credit by their habits of thrift and meeting
their obligations. What may now seem a
hardship to some will in the end be seen
to be a distinct benefit. There is plenty of
steady work for all in the district and at
higher wages than have ever been known.
There could not be a better time to inaugu- .
rate this new system in the camp. There
is only one time to save, and that is RIGHT
NOW! . Putting it off till tomorrow will
never save a nickel against need. Only one
more payday after this one, remember, and
then every one working for the companies
draws a full paycheck and buys when and
where and what he or she sees fit. . Better
think about it today and plan for tomorrow.
For the first time in ten years a world's
baseball series has failed to dominate all
other matters in the minds of the fans. The
war stands alone and, without a rival, even
with the first big game of the series al
ready played. Probably not 1 5 per cent of
the fans all over the country feel the old
time thrill of previous championship strug
gles. One reason is the tendency of a large
number of major league ball players to
shirk their duty. Scored of them dodged
into the shipyards and munition plants to
avoid active service. Again, the class of
the big league clubs ha$ been reduced to
minor league calibre). Not a team but that
has been shot to pieces during the season,
both Chicago in the national and Boston
in the American, the contenders, losing
star players. But the other clubs were so
hard hit that these teams won in spite of
ga,?s in their ranks that would in an ordi
nary year have put them out of the running
entirely. But baseball is not dead. After
the war it will come into its own again and
reign forever in most American hearts.
Since that second battle of the Marne the
German crown prince has changed his tune.
He no lenger prates of glorious victory and
a fatherland that shall dominate the world.
In his last interview he never rattled his
saber or his spurs once, but only sighed and
plaintively declared that Germany was
fighting for a draw and not for conquests.
He said the Americans did not know what
they were fighting for. Maybe not. But
they treated the crown prince pretty rough
on the Marne and they seem to have altered
his views of what he was fighting for mbre
than a little.
WHAT ARE JUGO SLAVS?
(Frr.m the Ixir.dnn Daily Mail)
The word Ju go-Slav is the Serbian for
South Slav, and before the war the South
Slavs numbered about twelve million peo
ple, occupying the independent states of
Serbia and Montenegro and the following
provinces of Austria-Hungary : Bosnia and
Hrr7crovira. annexed as recently as 1908;
Dalmatic, which became Austria after the
Nnpolcnic wars; Croatia. and Slovania; the
territories of the Slovenes; the Banat of
Trmesvar, Batchka and Baranya, in South
Hungary. These, provinces, for political
reasons chiefly, were under a variety of administrations.
"Th
Turkish tide which in the Middle
Ages swept over the Balkans and destroyed
the o'd Serbian empire swept later over
I lungary, and was only arrested at the gates
of Vienna. Then ihe tide gradually ebbed
;nd province after province became liber
ated. The Jugo-Slav provinces, freed from
the Turks, fell under the power of Austria,
all except Serbia and Montenegro, and it
was the desire of Austria for Serbia, which
stood on the high road of "Eastern expan
sion," that precipitated the European War.
The importance of the Jugo-Slavs lies
chiefly in the fact that they are, or were
before the war, a larger racial unit than
either German, Austrians, Hungarians,
Austrian Poles or Czecho-SIovaks. Their
political understanding with Poles and
Czecho-SIovaks is fraught with great po
tentialities, since those three races, with
out counting the Jugo-Slavs of Serbia, form
about two-thirds of the Austro-Hungarian
population.
The significance of the understanding
with Italy lies in the fact'that the ill feeling
between Italy and the Jugo-Slavs at the be
ginning of the war was acute. Italy claimed
and by secret treaty was promised, not only
Austrian territory occupied by Italians, but
also territory occupied by Jugo-Slavs.
Italy has now moderated her attitude
with something of the Mazzini vision.
THE IRISH GUARDS
FIGHTING FOR FRANCE AGAIN
One of the glory spots of Irish history
is the record of the Irish brigade that fought
for France under Marshal Saxe at Fonte
noy. Rudyard Kipling touches it with his
master hand subtle pen when he wrote the
following the other day under the caption,
"The Irish Guards Fighting for France
Again." The verses run :
We's not so old in the Army List,
Hut we're not so new In the ring.
For we carried our packs with Martial Saxe
When Louis was our King.
T.ut Douglas Hate's our Marshal now,
And we're King George's men.
And after one hundred and seventy years
We're fighting for France again!
Ah,' France! And did we stand by you.
When life was made splendid witn glfts and
rewards?
Ah, France! And will we deny you
In the hour of your agony. Mother of Swords?
Old days! The wild geese are flighting,
Head to the storm as they faced it before.
For where there arc Irish there's loving and fighting.
And when we stop either, it's Ireland no more!
Ireland no more!
CONFUSION IN AIRCRAFT
Last winter, when the productcion of De
Haviland planes was being held up for
months because of the inability of the sig
nal corps. to determine on the accesiories
that were to go on the planes, an officer
from Washington visited the Dayton
Wright plant to protest against the delay.
"If you don't get into production," he
told the manager, "the government will
have to take over the iplant and do the work
itself." "That would be fine," the manager
responded, "but would you mind telling
us what the government would produce?
If you could tell us what is wanted, we
might try to build it."
The incident cited is characteristic of the
confusion that existed in the signal corps
organization. One branch of the corp3 was
holding up production while another was
threatening to take over a factory because
it wasn't producing. The left hand didn't
know what the right hand was doing.
This confusion, the senate committee
found, still continued even under the new
organization with its two heads. It ought
to be corrected under the new division of
aeronautics as now constituted under Mr.
Ryan as second assistant secretary of war.

Once more the allies are ap

Mining and Financial News
BY REVIEW LEASED WIRE
NEW YORK, Sept. 5. The restrain
ing influence of the local financial in
terests was again a potent factor in
today's stock market, prices yielding
an average of 1 to 1 points on a pro
nounced curtailment of trading atter
the moderately active first hour. .
Promise of easier money, as sug
gested by yesterday's slight relaxation,
was not fulfilled.
United States Stee! was again fhe
pivot around which the market re
volved, its price fluctuating between
11594 and 113 and closing at 114,
a loss of almost' one point
Some of the independent steels and
equipments were firmer.
Oils and tobaccos were again favor
ed by pools, mostly at material ad
vances and coppers responded to the
better trade outlook, American smelt
ing making an extreme gain of almost
two points. v
Rails forfeited early gains at mid
day, but came forward again In tne
final dealings, retrieving the market
from its otherwist irregular tone. To
tal sales amounted ,to 390,000 shares.
Gains of 7 to 10 Vi points in some of
the underlying issues of the New
Haven road and its subsidiaries were
the striking features of the bond mar
ket, investment issues holding steady
to firm. Total sales par value aggre
gated $7,450,000. Old United States
bonds were unchanged on call.
GRAIN MARKET.
CHICAGO. Sept. 5. Falling ff or
notices of country consignments more
than counterbalanced in the corn mar
ket today the fact that frost predio
tions had failed. Although unsettled
the finish was c to 94c net higher,
with September $1.55 and October
I1.57V4 to 1.57. Oats closed un
changed to i,c lower and provisions
unchanged to a decline of 75c.
Selling was of only a scattered sort
and the market was easily influenced
by indications of lessened arrivals. In
this connection the fact that receipts
here today were comewhat smalled
and that the southwest wag drawing
supplies from central Iowa presuma
bly for feeding did a good deal to
bring about an upward slant in values
during the late transactions, despite
the outlook for warmer weather. The
Michigan state report, showing a crop
condition "of-71. against 80 a month
ago, was also a bullish factor.
Hedging sales by elevator inaterests
acted as a drag on the oats market.
Otherwise trade was light. '
Declines in the value of hogs weak
ened pork and ribs. Lard, though,
was sustained by demand for the cash
article.

Seemingly at the present rate of
progress this barrier shortly will have
been overcome and indeed the entire
salient northwest of Soissons obliter
ated. Already the French south of
Fresnes, on the Fringe of the high
forest of Coucy, have penetrated the
old Hindenburg line.
All behind the lines northeast of
Noyon great conflagrations are to be
seen, particularly around Jussy and
La Fere, which apparently Indicates
that the Germans Intend to fall back
ag fast as they can to the old German
lines running southeastward from St.
Quentin. The French and Americans
are hard after the Germans between
the Vesle river and the Aisne and for
more than eight miles, extending from
Conde to Viel-Arcy, they have driven
the enemy across the Aisne and are
standing on -the southern bank of the
river. Eastward toward Rheims, al
most up to the gates of the cathedral
tlty, the German line is falling back
northward. At the Anchor point of
the line in the vicinity of Rheims,
however, the Germans seem to be
held in g. evidently realizing that a ret
rograde movement here would necessi
tate a strengthening of their line per
haps as far eastwardas Verdun.
In the initial maneuver to the re
treat along the Vesle front the Ameri
cans and French captured both Ba
zaches and Fismet From Bazoches
they moved six miles northward to
Viel-Arcy, while from Flsmette they
have penetrated more than three miles'
northward to Barbonval, which is onlv
a little more than a mile south of
the Aisne.
In flanderg the British have taken
the rfown of Ploegstert and positions
southwest of Messlnes and northeast
of Wulverghem and repulsed strong
counter attacks launched against
them.
Southeast of Arras all the way down
the line to the south of the Somme
below Peronne the British have dug
more deeply into the enemy's front
on various sectors, especially toward
Cambrai, and immediately north and
south of Peronne, in the latter region
having dirven in the enemy's rear
guards for considerable distances.
The Germans have been violently
bombarding the Americans at Frapelle,
on the eastern end of the battle front
in Lorraine but have attempted no in
fantry attacks. More than 3,000 shells
many of them gas, have been sent
into the American line by the enemy.

WHEAT PRICE TO
LET FARMERS OUT
OF ANY LOSSES
However, Head of Bureau of
Farm Management Says
They Will Not Make For
tune on Market
(By Review Leased Wire)
WASHINGTON, Sept. 5 The aver
8Ke cost ot wlieat production was es
timated at $2.25 a bushel by E. H.
Thompson, acting chief or the bureau
of farm management, testifying btfore
the senate agricultural committee to
day. Mr. Thompson said most of the
wheat produced cost considerably less
and that even with a further increase
of 10 per cent In costs, the farmers
of the central west should be able to
"break even" at the primary market
price of $2.20. tixed by the president
lor next year's crop.
In the north central states the cost
for tue crop yoar of 1917 ran from
$1.50 to $3.50 a bushel, the committee
was told, while for a majority of grow
ers there the cost Vaaged from $175
to $2.50 a bushel.
"Then to .stimulate production you
would have to fix the price above that
amount?" asked Senator Norris of Ne
braska, reftrrine to the average cost
of $2.25 a bushel.
"Most assuredly," was the reply.
'Isn't the cost increasing constant
ly at a very rapid rate?" the Nebraska
senator again asked.'
Mr. Thompson said from present In
dications the cost for the 191S and
1919 crops would be much higher. He
estimated the cost of producing the
1917-1918 crop was 60 to 85 per cent
greater than during the pre-war pe
riod. "Can wheat In the central west be
produced at a profit at the Chicago
price fixed at $2.20 a bushel?" asked
Senator Norris. '
"Judging from information we hav
and with normal conditions the bulk 1
of the wheat can be produced at a !
prom."
Taking into consideration the freieht
charges and grade of wheat produced.
Senator Norris called attention to the
fact that to many farmers in the cen
tral west $2,20 a bushel at Chicago
would mean only a price of from $1.90
to $2 a bushel to them.- Mr. Thomp
son said, however, ttoat Investiga
tions made by the department of ag- j
ncuiture snowed tnat witn an increase
of 10 per cent in cost it would be pos
sible for farmers in that section of the
country to produce withoirt loss evert
at those prices. ;

TO PROTEST ON
FIXING OF PRICE
(Bv Review Leased Wire)
WASHINGTON, Sept. 5. Senators
from the cotton growing . states at a
conference today decided to protest
to President Wilson against any ac
tion by the war industries board look
ing to the fixing of cotton prices. The
senators hope ta see the president to
morrow. Chairman Baruch of the war indus
tries board announcedyesterday that
a committee soon would be appointed
with the approval of the president to
the cotton growing states and inquire
into the "advisability and feasibility"
of stabilizing cotton prices for the
protection of both the producers and
consutaers and of handling the crop

WASHINGTON, Sept. . 5.
Graphic stories of the Individual
heroism and daring of forty-one .
American ofifcers and men 'fight--ing
in France are told in cryptic .
citatiens by General Pershing in
awarding them distinguished serv
ice crosses. The citations were
received tonight at the war de
partment as a delayed section of
General Pershing's communique
for Wednesday.
One of the men decorated was
a private of infantry who was at
tacked by eleven when he entered
a cellar at Vaux July 1 to install
a telephone. He killed two of the
enemy and took the other nine
prisoners. A corporal of Infantry
cleared out a farm- house near
Villers Sur Fer July 8 single
handed, killing four Germans, cap
tnring one and holding the house
by himself until support arrived.
A sergeant of infantry after rush
ing ahead of his line near Sergy. "jly
28, was so badly wounded that he
could not stand. Ten Germans of the
Prussian guard attacked him. He rose
to his knees, shot five of them and
the others fled. In another case a
private of infantry on July 28 near
VJlIers Sur Fere saw six Germans
about to take prisoner his corporal
who had been severely wounded. He
called a comrade, advanced on the
Germans, killed two of them, took the
four prisoners and carried the corporal
to the American lines.
A machine gun sergeant brought
down two German airplanes which
were sweeping an American -trench
with machine gun fire. Despite the
rain of enemy bullets, the sergeant
turned his own machine gun on the
planes and riddled the upper one un
til it collapsed. In falling it struck
the lower one, causing it also to crash
to earth.
Several officers of the Infantry and
marines were cited for leading their
commands when wounded, for passing
through the enemy lines seeking in
formation, and for other acts of dar
ing. A chaplain and a cook were also
decorated for bravery and coolness in
attending wounded men under fire.
Among those named in the citations
are:
Major Benjamin S. Berry, Marines;
Second Lt. Clarence B. Christman,
Second Lt.' Frederick H. Hahn; Cpls

STATE FUEL HEADS
GATHER TO CONFER
(Bv Review leased Wire)
DENVER. Colo., Sept. 5 Fuel di
rectors of nine central and western
states and representatives of two of
the fuel handling zones, in the open
ing session of their conference here
with N. S. Schroeder of Washington,
representing Dr. Harry A. Garfield,
federal fuel administrator, devoted vir
tually all their time to informal discus
sion in executive session of actions
needed to better fuel mining and dis
tribution conditions in the states they
represent. The conference will con
tinue tomorrow at which time con
clusions may be drafted in the shape
of recommendations to the federal fuel
administrator.
One of the hardest problems the
fuel administration faces in this sec
tion, according to the discussion af to
day's conference is the economic dis
position of the slack from western
lignite mines. Many industries which
formerly furnished a market for a por
tion of this slack have closed owing
to war conditions, and great quantities
are accumulating at the mines, it was
said. Most of the state fuel adminis
trators reported that they had reason
able assurances of the needed coal
supply for. the coming winter, although
the car shortage continues to be a
bothersome factor.
Among those at the conference are
Harry N. Taylor, representing Zone 17,
Iowa, Kansas, Missouri, Oklahoma,
Arkansas and Texas, and the following
state administrators and their depu
ties: Augustine Kendall and A. C.
Chesten, Wyoming; J. R. Young, New
Mexico; J. O. Hoover, Arizona; Wylie
Blair, Texas, and W. J. Galligan and

GERMANS ARE DEPRESSED
WITH THE FRENCH ARMY IN
FRANCE, Sept. 5, (By the Associated
Press.) Thousands of letters taken
from prisoners during recent engage
ments show that the German army is
suffering even more from depression
and discouragement than from deplet
ed numbers.
In letters written home both by of
ficers and men the expressions most
recurring are:
"We have been fooled,'' and "we
have been bertayed." A staff officer
wa squoted by one officer in a letter
as having said "something is giving
way."
Officers made prisoner generally
have seized upon the significance of
the intervention of the United States
in the war, admitting they were de
cemived regarding the possibilities of
transportation of the great American
army-over seas. Only the younger of
ficers, who have had little experience
maintain the air of arrogance and con
fidence that characterized all the Ger
mans a few months ago. All the other
prisoners are far different from the
captives taken previous to the July of
fensive. They are tired and depressed
and disgruntled sometimes positively
hostile to the German high command.
Generally they have but a single hope
that Germany will be able to hold
out on a shortened line and compel
the allies to declare the war a draw.
CONTROVERSY IS ENDED
WASHINGTON. Sept. 5. The
Eiidteport controversy has been pass
ed upon by the highest tribunal set
up by the government, said the sec
retary of war, "and the only remain
ing question is that of enforcing the
decision."
Taking over the plants where pro
duction is threatened by the strikers
is not contemplated, it. was said, be
cause the employers have accepted
the board's award.
HALF MILLION SUIT.
CHICAGO. Sept. 5. An editorial
published by the Chicago Evening
Evening Post tcday, which, it is
charged, insinuates that the campaign
speeches of Mayor William Hale
Thompson, candidate for the Republic
a nomination for United States senator
from Illinois, may have been ludirect
ly responsible for the explosion of the
bomb' In the Federal building yester
day, led the mayor to file a $000,000
libel suit against the newspaper late
today.
DIFFERENT UNIFORMS FOR

tentiary today by a court martial
at Camp Grant for disobedience
of orders. They refused to don

MUST SPEED UP.
WASHINGTON, Sept. 5. Provost
Marshal General Crowder said today
that the national selective service ma
chinery must speed up operations Im
mediately to make it possible to get
men of the new 18 to 45 registration
on the way to army cantonments by
the end of October.
General Crowder said questionaires
would go out to registrants before the
drawing has been conducted to deter
mine their order of call, and that lo
cal boards would be urged to com
mence classification immediately. It
may be possible to hold the drawing
on Oct 2.

WITH THE BRITISH ARMY IN
FRANCE, Sept. a. (By the Associated
Press.) It was through a somewhat
analongous situation to that existing
at present that the Drocourt-Queant
switch line was established after the
enemy was forced back from the orig
inal Hindenburg line in front of Ar
ras. The old Hindenburg line ijself
does not run straight north and south.
To the south of the Drocourt battle
area it swerves sharply to the east
and then tails off southeastward. It
is the eastern stretch that the British
have been clearing of the boche.
The Germans may try to establish a
new defensive line which would run
almost directly north and south, join
ing the Hindenburg line at some
points southwest of Cambrai, but there
are indications that the enemy is by
no means sure that his efforts will
meet with any success.
The fact that since the Drocourt
Queant line was smashed the Germans
have retreated front the ground be
hind it, which is of first importance
to the retention of their defenses in
the north and south, without making
a single formidable attempt to regain
their lost positions by counter at
tacks is considered proof positive of
the enemy's weakness in this area.
The fact that the German command
has hesitated to withdraw any con
siderable troops from other sections of
the front for the operations here is
taken to mean that the German com
mand fears that such a movement
would only lead to another catas
trophe. Long periods of fighting without
the slightest respite, the annihilation
of whole formations and the thorough
hammering they have received have
served to fix the idea of saving them
selves foremost in the minds of the
German troops. Every prisoner in his
comments on the great battlt seems
to bear this out. Almost every diary
and every letter 'taken from Germans
killed show that the enemy troops on
the western front have suffered from
the long, continued fighting as never
before. A typical excerpt from an un
posted letter says:
"We are in mortal danger every day.
We cannot last much longer. We can
not hope for further successes. Our
enemy' is superior to us in numbers
and everything else. Victory now is
out of the question." ,
Many letters end with the words
"poor Germany."
The German shortage in men In this
locality may well be imagined by the
fact that among the prisoners taken
are men who were received as drafts
in the Infantry formation after having
been combed out of the field bakery
establishments and motor transport
columns. "

MRS. BRADLEY SAYS
IT SAVED HER LIFE
j "I Can Hardly Find Words to
1
j Express My Gratitude for
Tanlac," She Says
"I have not only gotten back all the
weight I lost while sick, but I am ac
tually heavier now than 1 have ever
been," said Mrs. Lucy Bradley, resid
ing at 7329 Ell avenue, Seattle, Wash.,
recently, in one of the most remark
able statements yet published in con
nection with the Master Medicine in
this vicinity.
"I had suffered" from stomach trou
ble," continued Mrs. Bradley, "until I
was scarcely more than a frame of
skin and bones. One day about three
years ago, after eating some straw
berries, I was taken with an attack
of acute indigestion, and was down in
bed for some time unable to move. Be
ginning from that time my stomach
was In such a bad fix that exerything I
ate would ferment, causing gas. short
ness of breath and fearful pain. There
was a pain right through my heart
that couldn't have hurt much worse
if I had been stuck with a knife, and
several times I thought I would surely
die. I just kept losing weight and
got so weak I cruldn't walk across the
room. I was forbidden to eat anything
except liquid. I tried drinking sweei
milk and even that was like poison
to me. I suffered a great' deal with
pains in my back( and hardly knew
what sleep was.
"We were lhing in St. Lopis at this
time, and a friend of ours had golteu
such splendid results from Tanlac that
my husband begged me to take it. I
refused for a time, as I had na faith in
it to help me. but I kept getting worse
and my husband insisted. So I consent
ed to try it ,p.nd when he brought me
my first bottle I weighed only one
hundred and ten pounds and was al
most frantic with suffering. Now I can
hardly find wcrds to express my
gratitude, for I really don't believe
would be here today if it hadn't been
for Tanlac. Soon after I started tak
ing it I began to feel better. It was
the very thing forme and it wasn't
long until I could eat just any and
eveiything I wanted without it hurting
me; and my- appetite was so big :
could hardly eat enough. Well, tha
has been a good while ago and fron
that time until now I have never suf
fered a particle with my stomach
shortness of breath or pain of any
kind. I sleep like a child every night
and am strong and healthy in ever
way. I now weigh one hundred and
fifty-six pounds making a gain of
forty-six pounds I tell everybody thai
I know that Tanlac is the finest meili
cine in the warld and I certainly have
the best of reasons for saying so."

J. Warren Kerrigan's l"aralta play,
"The Turn of a Card," from the story

The screen version of the story, which
was written by Thomas J. Geraghty,
concerns the adventures of Jimmy
Montgomery Farrell, a young college
man who goes west to look over some
oil lands. He secures an option on a
piece of land and discovers it to con
tain one of the greatest gushers in that
part of the country. In the mean
time, he becomes involved in a series
of exciting experiences with a gambler
and leaves for the east to dispose of
his option, after having won not only
a fortune in money, but also a mag
nificent estate, on New York's fash
ionable Lond Island.
Upon his arrival in the east he visits
his property and there meets tho
daughter of the former owner, who has
just returned from abroad and who is
not aware of the fact that the prop
erty no longer belongs to her father.
A romance develops which promises
to be shattered at any moment dur
ing the exciting complications which
follow.

EYE - NERVE - GLASSES
Eye Strain causes agonizing headaches, indigestion,
nervousness, wrinkles, frowns and cross-eyes. Every
case corrected without drugs or operation. It makes
school life a torture to one out of every five children.
Yours may be that one. The uneducated optician tries
to correct muscular trouble with glasses by one fitting.
As their knowledge increases the less they try to do this.
Fitting glasses correctly is more delicate than surgical
operation. I fit glasses without drugs, dope or danger,
and being a graduate opthalmologist, Tkonw my busi
ness thoroughly. Permanently located in Bisbee, on
Main street. Next to Masonic Temple. Phone 1 56

Note If you want to tell the difference between th
"shell" (celluloid) framej or mountings (the kind of
glasses that give such an "intellectual" look) and the
ones made from the soy bean, touch a match to them,
you will quickly find the difference.
