Broken Up by Seoul Police
OASACA, Japan, March 14 (By tie
Associated Press). Disturbances con
tinue in the provinces of Korea, and
are resulting in bloodshed on both
sides, according to advices received
here. Eighty-five localities have been
affected.
Some of the Japanese say mission
aries have encouraged or even insti
gated the riots. The leading mission
ary at Seoul, however, has refuted the
accusation that the missionaries1 in
spired the unrest, declaring that none
of them knew that trouble was brew
ing. ' Isaburo Tamagata, deputy resi
dent general of Korea, is quoted as
saying that the chief cause of the tur
moil has been an. erroneous concep
tion of self determination. M. Tama
gata added that as a result of toe
disturbances the government had dis
covered a flaw in the administration
of Korea which would be rectified.
WASHIXGTOX, March 14. Official
advices received by the state depart
ment today from the Orient described
the independence movement in Korea
as a. spontaneous one which had as
sumed large proportions. No effort
at organized resistance to Japanese
authority has been undertaken, but
demonstrations and meetings have
been held throughout the country.
Many of the demonstrations were rep
resented by the Japanese authorities,
but it was said that the Japanese later
adopted a more conciliatory attitude
and that they might treat the aspira
tions of the Koreans with more sympa
thy. Immediate demands of the Kor
eans Include freedom of speech, right i
of petition and the teaching of the f
Korean language In the schools with
ultimate independence for the country.
Riots Launched Early
The demonstrations at Seoul and'
other pcints were planned to take
place on the day of the former emper
or's funeral, but after learning that
the Japanese had ordered gendarmes
In from outlying districts, the leaders
launched the movement two days
earlier.
The state department issued this
statement on the demonstrations:
"The department of state ha3 re
ceived information relative to the re
cent disturbances at Seoul and other
parts of Korea, which resulted in the
arrest of a large number of rioters.
The trouble seems to have originated
through the circulation of a document
signed by 32 Koreans containing at
tacks upon the Japanese government
and declaring the independence of
Korea.
Parade Broken Up
A parade composed largely of stud
ents of Japanese and mission schools
was broken up by the police at Seoul.
Disorders occurred at other points,
principally In northern Korea, where
there was reported a small loss of
life.
"A telegram received by the depart
ment reports that on March 12 the
street demonstrations had practically
ceased at Seoul and elsewhere and
that it was officially announced, that
only 15 per cent of the active partici
pants were Christians; that the prin
cipal leaders were members cf a new
political religious society and that for
eign missionaries were not connected
with the movement. The object of
the demonstrations is stated to have
been to cbtain freedom of speech, right
of petition and use of the Korean lan
guage in schools and the correction
of other grievances.

Should Act In Unison - ' "
Attacks G. O. P. Leaders
Mr. Cummings launched a vigorous
attack upon the republican leaders
for what he termed "their unusual ef
forts during the last two or three
years to regain mastery of the machin
ery of government."
"To this purpose, he .asserted,
"they have brought all their ingenuity,
have summoned all their resourceful
ness, have magnified beyond all reason
minor errors of judgment in the cos
duct of the great war, have mobil
ized the forces of irritation and dis-
i content and have made tacit conces
sions to certain elements, which, to
say the "least, show tendencies toward
open sedition. It is an uifholy alliance
and cannot prevail. .
"When congress adjourned on
March 4. n open filibuster against
pending legislation was still in pro
gress. The senate abdicated its func
tions, declined to consider the most
pressing of national needs and wasted
precious moments in violent political
abuse and vehement opposition to the
league of nations.

Mr. Daniels, "that a mandate of con-! Rnrrtir. W K,tt w-wh will

ot:: nawH hv nracticallv unanim- j
ous vote of bota iiouses, directing the
president to do all in his power to
create such a league, might answer
even their fastidious requirements.
Let us see how such action could be
drawn up and make a guess at their
attitude toward it. First would come ;
a preamble on the policy or the coun
try. Let us start it out something like
this:
" "It is hereby declared that it is the
policy of the United States to adjust
and settle its international disputes
through mediation or arbitration, to
the end that war may be honorably
avoided.
"This should be followed by a direo- i
tion to the president to take steps to
carry out the policy. We might put it
this way:
" "In view cf the premises, the presi- j
dent is authorized and requested to in-
vite, at an appropriate time, not later j
than the cpse of the war in Europe,
all the great governments of the world i
to send representatives to a onfer- i
ence which shall be charged with the j
duty of formulating a plan for a court
of arbitration or other tribunal, to
which disputed questions between na- j
tions shall be referred for adjudica- j
t tion and peaceful settlement. " ;
Not Fanciful Sketch
Stating that this would seem to (
cover the situation pretty thoroughly, i
Mr. Daniels added: I
"Gentlemen, what 1 have read is not !
a fanciful sketch. It is a law of the
United States of America, now on our
statute books, passed by these same
gentlemen in 1916 which you may
verify by reading the naval appropria-:
tion act, approved by the president of I
the United States on August 29. 1916." j
The text of the act,, as quoted by j
him. said: - - j
"It is hereby declared to be the j
policy of the United States to adjust)
I and settle its international disputes
reports from overseas confirmed the
necessity of maintaining, and in some
of its aspects, augmenting this work.

SIMS LAUDS PERSHING
, IN FAREWELL SPEECH
BEFORE LONDON CLUB
American Naval Chief Recalls
He Predicted War
4nl9l0
(By Review Leased Wire)
LONDON, March 14. Vice Admiral
William S. Sims, commander of the
American naval forces In the war
zone, in a farewell speech at the
American Luncheon Club, said that in
1910 when 16 American warships
spent several weeks in European wa
ters he submitted a secret report to
the admiral commanding that in his
opinion and that of many American
and British officers, war could not be
put off more than four years.
He stated that he just wanted to
mention this- fact for what It was
worth.
Reviews Work of Navy
After referring to his "undiplomatic
remarks" at the Guildhall in London
several years ago. when he asserted
that Great Britain and the United
States would be found together in the
next war, he reviewed the work ot
the Navy, saying it had cooperated
closely with the American Army.
. 'There was no friction," Admiral
Sims declared, "that may seem a plat
itude, but all my reading of naval his
tory has convinced me that this was
the first instance in the world where
an army and navy really cooperated.
Most of the commanders Bpent the bal
ance of their lives writing how the
other fellow was mistaken. I have
the greatest admiration for John
Pershing. He had the greatest job
any commander ever had, and you
would be surprised if you knew the
trouble we had to get the army to the
front,
Pershing Praised
"1 not only have the greatest re
gard for General Pershing but the
greatest contempt for the way certain
people in the United States are crit
icizing him. If anyone needs praise
he does, with a lot of small things
on the other side barking at his heels."
Admiral Sims paid a tribute to his
staff, several of whom he mentioned
as having been responsible for the
success of the American Navy in Eu
ropean waters, and said he considered
it "not only the best organization the
United States Navy ever had but the
only one."
-ohn Blair Macfe, in presenting a-
nuge silver tea and coffee service, the
gift of Americans in London, said that
Admiral Sims had been sent to his
post not neding diplomacy, but. "with
out being a diplomat he has been ac
tually diplomatic

A campaign to stimulate industry,
as a means ot solving the unemploy
ment problem will be conducted and

Yesterday the Norwood well east of us went to 14000 barrels a day, proving itself
to be the biggest oil well in the United States and one of the biggest in the world,
making such tremendous producers as the Emma Terrell, The Roper, Connellee
and Copeland No. 1 look like second raters, and the Ranger field hasn't been
scratched. Geologists have always claimed that as wells come in farther west of
Ranger the production will be larger. The geologist for the Magnolia company,
drilling next to us on the west, claims we are in the center of the deeptpool and
that all the big companies believe it, is proven by the developments going x on
around us. Reports on the Norwood well have doubled the sale of our stock. In
order to get some of this stock at $1.00 you will have to wire, telephone or mail

The Future's
One hundred years ago a London dude and glutton named Hugh
Paddington had a Hungarian miller grind the world's' first white flour
so tbat his bread would match the tablecloth. The fad spread among
the smart set. became common and a tw food was added to man's
bill-of-fare.
Thirty-three years before that, potatoes were considered fit only for
pigs. Ben' Franklin scoffed at them until invited in 17S6 to a potato
dinner given by Parmentier, the great character In French history who
introduced potatoes to the family table.
Talk that over at dinner tonight.
Consider how food has changed in the last century. A few genera
tions from now, when our great-grandchildren sit down to their evening
meal, will they eat foods now unknown to us?
Older folk can cast an eye over the 1919 table and list many things
that have arrived within their memory. Grape-fruit is a modern food.
A few years back it grew only in the West Indies where the natives
thought it poisonous. Ice cream was unknown until 103-years ago when
Sambo Jackson, New York pastry expert, made the first dish of it by
accident. Grandma, can't you remember when tomatoes were called
"love apples, supposed to cause cancer and rarely appeared, except on
the sitting-room mantel?
Prehistoric man lived on flesh, fish, fowl and fruit. Slowly he added
to his menue. Black bread and olive oil in sealed urns have been found
in ancient Egyptian tombs.
The art of cooking originated with the Greek3 and was borrowed by
the Romans. The Italians gave the world modern cookery taught French
chefs their trade. They even nvented the fork and spoon. England
followed France, producing the famous chef families,, Cooke and Coke.
Eternally man seeks novelty for his palate in Mexico, parrots; in
northern SEweden, earth baked in bread for its supposed medicinal value.
The savages of the. Sudan dote on ants, Brazilians on butterflies. Digger
Indians eat dried locusts.
What of the future man's food a century from now?
Will he carry his lunch in a pill box? Will wifey urge, "Eat the
green pill last it's .dessert?"
No, say the German scientists who. to keep the Huns from starv
ing during the war, tried every food substitute from sawdust to drugs
that stop hunger pangs.
These experts decided that artificial or even concentrated food is
a failure. Eutter, for example, is four-fifths pure fat. This, according
to Dr.v Robert Hutchinson of Edinburgh, is the absolute limit in con
densing of food values.
It is all very fine to talk of calories, proteids, albumose, carbo
hydrates and peptone; but man requires food with bulk to it the filling
stuff tbat sticks to the ribs.
Strange may be the changes of the next century. Refrigeration
schemes may be it upon to bring to American tables the fine steaks and
Toasts of caribou that run wild in herds of hundreds of thousands in the
Yukcn and northest territories. Canadians already are preparing to
market reindeer meat The meat of the whale has come to Bisbee. Wild
Hudson Bay Tea may become common. Bitter Hour from white moss,
the food of mountain sheep, may be a familiar sight at the 1990 grocery
store.
Undoubtedly the world will soon have foods unknown today, but
chemicals can never take the place of real stuff like pancakes, corned
beef and cabbage and pie in the stomach or sentimentallv.
Home Means
Home!
You remember how it was before the war Home was a good place
to eat in and sleep in and fuss with your folks in, and that was about
alL Father had his lodge meetings and brother hurried down to the
corner to shoot pool with the other fellers and sister went off to a movie
with a friend and mother poor mother after putting the cat out ?nd
locking the windows, hurried over to the neighbors to have a little gossip.
It's considerably different now. Home means more. It means a com
fortable feeling around brother's heart as he tosses around in a transport
homeward bound it means warmth and good "eats' and affection and
the old cat purring around his legs and sister patting him on the back
and mother fussing over him and father trying not to look too proud.
Home means more to sister, too. She thinks of those friends' homes
broken up by the war and those sad eyed girls whd will never have
homes of their own with the sweethearts they sent across the seas.
And sister, while feeling orry about those not so fortunate as herself,
smiles as she should because everything is all right with her own
world and she's going to soon have a home of her own, with all that
means.
Father looks around the bouse with new eyes. It's been worth work
ing for to build up a home of love and loyalty like this. It's good to have
afine wife and a charming daughter and a son to be proud of. -
And mother the housework that used to be a drudge is easy now.
How could it be otherwise when her work means comfort and pleasure
to her family when they come home? ; .
That's it that's what Home now is, a place to get back to! Before
the v.ar it was something to get away from NOW, IT'S THE BEST
PLACE IN THE WORLD TO GET BACK TO!
Good Bye
The regular session of the Fourth State Legislature has ended.
Some are satisfied and many are but more firmly of the belief that a
legislature is an institution with which we could well dispense.
Some, there are. who predict an extra session. May the good Lord
deliver us. We have been extra-sessioned to death in Arizona since
1912 and the people, though familiar with torture, have not become
resigned.
Legislatures, many think, are necessary evils. Under ordinary cir
cumstances for rather under our laws) they meet every two years. They
entertain the city of Phoenix, the governor, the other state officials and
the few peopIewho pay close attention to their mental gymnastics. They
are nice affairs, nicely handled but deliver us, nevertheless.
So the Fourth Regular Session is ended. We don't believe anybody
cares, particularly, except those few who worked for a larger wage than
at home. But the general run of folks heave a sigh of gratitude and
now enter a siesta of comfort and a tormentless season. Tucson Star.
In an autocracy, politicians hape for nothing greater than the right
to bask in the fierce white light that beats upon a throne, and in a
democracy they have no higher ambition than the spotlight.
Those who get great benefit by ignoring national law are hoping
that the Quaker's proverbial love of peace will keep Palmer from start
ing anything as attorney general.
We are wondering whether the appointment of Hapgood as ambassa
dor to Denmark is a belated reward for bis muckraking or a recognition
of his reform.
The Prussian government has declared a state of siege in
barmen. If that thriving suburb is really in need of bar men.

GOVERNOR HINTS HE
WILL CALL SPECIAL
SESSION ON ROADS
Chief Executive to Take Trip
Through State to Learn
Highway Needs
I CBv Review Iau1 Wir
1 PHOENIX, Ariz.. March 14. That a
1 special session of the state legisla
1 ture to take up road and other im
portant legislation is in prospect was
the hint given by Governor Campbell
m an interview today. The chief ex
ecutive also stated that he would
make a trip through the state in the
near future for a personal inspection
of the highway needs of the different
counties and to ascertain the views
of the people on the method of ap
pointment of the highway commission
The latter point was that on which
the governor and the democratic ma
jority in the legislature disagreed in
connection with road legislation of the
session just closed.
"More constructive legislation has
been passed in the session which
closed last night than in any other
since Arizona came into statehood,
said the governor. "I consider the
creation of a board of regents for
the University of Arizona, perpetuat
ing the board and thus, lifting it out
of politics, of major importance in
the educational field.
Budget System Commended
"The adoption of a budget system
also is marked, progress in the right
direction and along the lines followed
in other states. It will enable me ex
ecutive to present to the legislature
a trial balance of the fiscal affairs
of all state institutions and depart
ments and contemplates the audit of
any department which may be desired.
only regret the fund for auditing;
$1000, s so small.
"On the subject of roads." the gov
ernor continued, "I regret it was im
possible for the legislature and my
self to concur on a broad, constructive
plan embodying a highway commis
sion, the members of which would be
geographically located so that all
parts of Arizona would be represented
and so that men of affairs might be in
control. However, I think I see my
way clear, with special appropriations
for roads and bridges and contingency
monies from other- sources, including
the assistance of various county funds,
bond issues and direct levies, to meet
the amount of federal aid now avail
able and to become available in the
next two years.
Special Session Hinted
I feel assured that Lt. Thomas Mad-
dock, who has accepted the post of
state engineer, which bfe formerly oc
cupied and in which he will have as
sociated with him former State Engi
neer Holmquist, will be able to spend
the funds advantageously on a sys
tem of state routes.
'If it becomes necessary to call a
special session of the legislature io
consider important legislation that
failed in the past session, and other
measures which might arise through
the uncertainty of national conditions.
shall feel inclined to include in the
program a can ior ine orgauaauuu
of a state highway commission along
the lines I have mentioned. In that
event I believe that lasting and per
manent results would be obtained on
measures of non-partisan and non-local
character through the sentiment of the
people expressed to the members ot
the legislature in the meantime.
House Commended
It is iky intention to give my per
sonal consideration to the road pro-
zrara now being budgeted and during
trips which I hope to make in the near
future throughout the state 1 shall
take up this subject and the methods
of creating a highway eommissiuu
with the people. I feel that had the
question of the highway commission
not gotten into the realm of partisan
politics much more constructive legis
lation would have passed.
it was a source of gratification to
me that the house sustained my stand
in vetoing the Winsor election code
hv 17 to 15 vote, and I accept that
decision as a realization on the part of
the house that the members are meet-
ng matters of a partisan nature in me

lily Review Leased "Wire)
PHOENIX, Ariz, March 14
One of the Globe "influenza
cases," that in which school dis
trict No. 1 of Globe brought suit
against the city, the health board
and the chief of police, has been
decided by the state supreme
court against the school district.
The judgment, which was hand
ed down today upholds the de
cision of the lower court from
which appeal was taken, but spe
cifically states that this decision
refers only to the case in which
it was rendered and is not to be
applied generally as designating
the powers of health boards. . Is
sue is taken with the health -board
in designating school, held during
an epidemic, as a nuisance.
The case was launched by the
Globe school district when the
health. board ordered the schools
closed during the recent influenza
epidemic.
Another case brought by a
Globe theater owner along the
same lines has not yet been de
cided. MEMORIAL TO LATE

PETERSON REGRETS
FAILURE OF THREE
Speaker of House Declares
Much Important Legis
lation Passed
tBy Review Leased Wlrei
PHOENIX, Ariz.. March 14 Regret
at defeat in the senate of the educa
tional code . and the morality bills
which passed the house, and satisfac
tion at the amount of other construc
tive legislation which was put through
during the 60 day session of the legis
lature were expressed today by A. C
Peterson, speaker of the house.
"I was deeply interested in the edu
cational code," said the speaker, "and
I keenly regret that.it failed in the
senate after passing the house. I also
hoped for the passage of the morality
j bills suggested by the federal auth
orities for the safeguarding of our
home coming troops.
"On the other hand we were able to
perfect a surprisingly large amount of
valuable and needed legislation. The
first highway commission bill was ve
toed by " the governor and a second
now is in his hands, but aside from
j these we passed a mimber of road and
bridge measures of considerable im-
portance. Among these were appro
ipriations for the Williams-Clarkdale
road, the Sunerior-Miami road, the Mo-
i have county section of the Arrowhead
J trail, two bridges over the Colorado
I river, approaches to Lee's ferry, a
1 bridge over the iGla river and some
j others.

BY REVIEW
NEW YORK. March 14 On the
surface today's stock market differed
in no important particular from the
previous sessions of the week, aside :
previous sessions of the week, aside :
from a halt in the activity during the I
mid-session when the general list was
inclined to react.
There was the same furious and
spasmodic churning of prices among
specialties, notably Industrial Alco
hol, distillers, and some of the oils
and equipments.
Pools later extended their opera
tions, shippings enjoying especial fa
vor. Secondary or low priced motors
were in demand during hte last half
Of the session.
New York Air Brake, Pressed Steel
Car. Crucible SteeL Colorado Fuel,
Pennsylvania, Seaboard and Harvester
embraced the strong equipments,, but
United States SteeJ continued to re
flect selling pressure, closing at a
slight loss.
Miscellaneous specialties of strength
included California Packing and Wor
thington Pump. Leathers and ferti
lizers extended recent gains, but cop
pers and tobaccos eased slightly with
further restraint in rails. Sales
amounted to 1,025.000 shares.
Dullness again characterized the
bond market. Liberty 34s strength

BRADSTREETS REPORT
NEW YORK. March 14. Brad
streets's tomorrow will say:
While inclement weather and bad
roads are a bar to seasonal trade ex
pansion - and price uncertainties still
hold back buying and industrial ope
rations, the wek's report is one of
moderate but definitep rogress toward
better things. Favorable fea teres are
the continued strnegth of the securi
ties markets, the settlement of ship
yard strikes and the resumption of
considerable textile machinery m New
England, the result being a reduction
in the number of unemployed. Rain
or snow has had a favoring or hurt
ful effect, accordingly as different sec
tions and products are considered.
Winter wheat, south, west and on the
Pacific coast has been helped, but
Southern advices are that rain had
put the farmers much behind " with
preparations for planting. While pros
pects for the chief bread grain are
favorable in the Southwest and Far
West, Southern advices, except in
Texas and Tennessee are less cheer
ful.

GRAIN MARKET
CHICAGO. March 14. Possibilities
of Government interference with any
activity against lower prices for food
brought about fresh breaks today in
the corn market. The close was
nervous as the same as yesterday's
finish to 2c lower, with May $1.35U
to $1.B5 and July $1.29 to $1.29i.
Oats finished unchanged fo c de
cline, and provisions down 37c to $1.
Corn started sharply lower and
throughout the day there was heavy
se.ling on all upturns.
Oats chiefly reflected the action of
corn.
Provisions were governed by the
bearish stand ascribed to the Food
Administration. Gossip was current,
however, that semi-monthly stocks
would show important decreases.

brought up by the apes ranks head and
shoulders above his aristocrat relative.
There are no class lines, no national
lines, no mutual exploitation among
our ancestors.
"Tarzan of the Apes" Is bully adven
ture. Wild beasts roam through the
scenes; a kindly elephant takes the
wild man upon his back; in short, mix
Stevenson's "Treasure Island" with
Captain Baker's African stories and
the happy combination is struck. The
Joy of the film lies in its kindly wild
life rather than its civilized brutality.
And In putting Burroughs story into
the film the National Film corpora
tion has shown good scenes of show
manship. "Tarzan" is better than most
films which have been concocted for
the screen, and credit must be given
Scott Sidney, who staged it, and Isldor
Bernstein, who edited it. Natural
beauties, Imagination and clean, free
spirit make the film a delight. Adv.
