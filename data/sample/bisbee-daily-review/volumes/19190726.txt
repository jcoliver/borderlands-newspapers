PLEA OF CHI
AGAINST JAPAN
BEFDRESENATE
Official Copy of Appeol To
Allies at Versailles Reveals
Charge Japs Kept China Out
Of the War Against Germany
WASHINGTON. July 25. Senator
Spencer, Republican, of Missouri, laid
before the senate today what he said
was an official copy of China's plea
at Versailles against the Shantung
settlement.
The petition declares Japan's
promise t o return Kiaochaw
at some future date is "illusionary,"
in that it gives no pledge to return
also the surrounding territor:' dom
inating Kiaochow. It is recited that
the treaties resulting in Japan's claim
to Kiaochow which followed the ram
ous twenty-one demands of 1915,
were made under "intimidation" and
that Japan's real aim in entering the
war against Germany was to
strengthen her own position in the
far east.
China's appeal for abrogation of
the 1915 treaties was summarized as
follows:
"1. Because these treaties at
tempt to deal with matters whose
proper . determination is entirely
a right of the peace conference.
"2. Because they contravene the
allied formula of justice and powers
now serving as the guiding rules ot
the peace conference.
"3. Because specifically they vio
late the territorial integrity and prin
pal independence of China as guar
anteed in the series Of" conventions
and agreement concluded by Great
Britain, France, Russia, andl the
United States with Japan.
"4. Because they were negotiated
in circumstances of intimidation and
concluded under the duress of the
Japanese ultimatum of May, 1915.
"5. Because they are lacking in
finality, being so regarded by Japan,
who sought to make them final by
negotiating, before China was suffer
ed to enter the war, a set of secret
agreements at variance with the prin
ciples accepted by the beligerants as
the basis of the peace settlement."
Says Japan Lost Allies 'Aid
Tha petition declared that except
for the attitude of Japan, China
would have joined the allies in Au
gust, 1914, or at latest by November,
1915, instead of remaining out until
February, 1917. It also declares that
if Japan itself had not kept China
out of the war until Kiaochow had
been captured, ' "the leased territory
of Kiaochow would have been direct
ly restored to China as one of the
states associated in the war against
the Central powers."
STRIPIDED
LONDON, July 25. The Miners'
Federation today accepted the govern
ment's offer of new piece rates for
coal mining and recommended that
all miners' unions accept the proposi
tion and return to work. The York
shire miners will meet tomorrow and
decide whether they will accept. . It is
believed they will do so.
The" government is leaving navy
men at the mines where tbe men have
gone out until work is generally re
sumed, and the railways are continu
ing their preparations for increased
services should there be any such set
tlement. . ) -
The government's piece rate offer
accepted by the Miners" Federation,
according .to Robert Smilie.'a mine
workers' leader, ('coincides with the
resolutions adopted by the miners'
conference at Keswick. It removes a
grievance which was the direct cause
of the Yorkshire strike.- '
There still remain other grievances
of the miners, the first is the omis
sion of the government to take steps
in the direction of the recommenda
tions in the recent Sankey report for
the gradual nationalization of the
mines and the second, the govern
ment's refusal to grant the demands
of the miners for an impartial expert
inquiry into decreased output which
the miners assert is due largely to the
failure of the mine owners to keep
their mines in proper working order.
They accuse the owners of deliber
ately neglecting to repair l lie equip
ment of the mines in order to discred
it nationalization.

Democrats Seek to Impeach
Republican Majority Report
But Are Voted Down; Deny
Food Allowed to Deteriorate
WASHINGTON, July 25. Plans of
Democratic members of the house war
investigating committee to attempt
impeachment of the majority commit
tee report censuring the war depart
ment for delaying sale of surplus food
stuffs and asking adoption of a policy
of immediate deliberation, were block
ed today by Republicans.
By a strict party vote the Demo
cratic request, for a reopening of
hearings on the food stocks was de
nied. The Democrat members had an
nounced they would attempt to dis
prove statements contained in the re
port. "
Final committee action today fol
lowed a long executive session at
which the Democratic members in
asking the reopening of hearings, sub
mitting a list of additional witnesses,
including Secretary Baker, and other
war department officials. Voted down,
tne .Democrats decided to include
statements of the suggested wit
nesses in their minority report.
Conferences had previously been held
by the Democratic members, headed
by Republican Representative Flood,
Virginia, with several war depart
ment Officials, including Secretary
Bauer, wno denied 'It was his policy
to witnnoia tne foodstuffs from the
domestic market and to pay the inter
est which these products had been
purchased," as charged in the ma
jority report.
Chairman Graham, after the com
mittee meeting, asserted that such a
policy existed and that subsequent re
ports on other subjects would be made
by the committee to prove the policy
applied to various commodities as well
as food. He asserted that, "tbe same
private control of the government
continues as was exercised by the
council of national defense in framing
war policies."
Mr. Flood's conference with war de-1
partment officials today led him to
challenge the majority report in a let
ter which was concurred in by the
other Democrats in asking a reopen
ing of the hearings.
The letter asserted the report's
statement that no surplus foodsturta
was declared for six months, was er
roneous; for there had been some
sales-.before May. It also challenged
the statement that the food was per
mitted to deteriorate during this time.

Johnson's Resolution, Says
U. S. Troops Must Stay By
Agreement Made With Japan
WASHINGTON. July 25. President
Wilson informed the senate today in
response to a resolution by Senator
Johnson, Republican, California, that
the presence of American troops in
Siberia was a "vital element," in the
restoration and maintenance of traf
fic on tiie Siberian railroad and that
under the agreement with Japan they
could be withdrawn only when the
American experts operating the road
were withdrawn.
The president said Siberia could be
protected from a further period of

the railroad open and that lacking

there wore looking to the United

in the railway plan, and ith the ap
proval of the inter-all ted committee,
the military commiader3 in Siberia
have established troops here it is
necessary to maintain order at differ
ent parts of the line.
"The American forces under Gen
eral Graves, are understood to be pro
tecting parts of the line near Vladi
vostok, and also on the section around
Verchne Udinsk. There is also under
stood to be a small body ol American
troops at Harbin.
"The instructions to General Graves
direct him not to interfere in Russian
affairs, but to support Mr. Stevens
wherever necessary. -The Siberian
railroad is not only the main artery
for transportation in Siberia, but is
the only open access to European
Russia today.
Siberia Is Exuusted.
"The population of Siberia, whose
resources have been -ilmost exhaust
ed by the olng years of war and the
chaotic conditions whi.h ' ave existed
there, can be protects from a further
period of chaos and nnaichy only by
the restoration and main of traffic
along the Siberian railway.
"Partisan bands under leaders hav
ing no settled connection with any (Or
ganized government and. bands under
leaders whose allegiance to any t Bee
tled authority is apparently temporary
and transitory, are constantly menac
ing the operation of the railway, and
the safety of its permanent structures.
Kolchak Dependent on U. S.
"The population of western Sibe
ria and the. forces of Admiral Kol
chak are entirely dependent upoa
these railways.
"The Russian authorities in this
country have succeeded in shipping
large quantities of Russian supplies
to Siberia and the secretary of war
is now contracting with the great
co-operative societies which operate
throughout European and Asiatic
Russia to ship further supplies to
meet the needs of the civilian popu
lation. The Kolchak givernment is
also endeavoring to arrange for the
purchase of medical and other Red
Cross supplies from the war depart
ment, and the American Red Cross
is itself attempting the forms of re
lief for which it is organized. All
elements of the population in Siberia
look to the United States for assist
ance. This cannot be given to the
population of Siberia, and ultimately
to Russia, if the purpose entertained
for two years to restore railway traf
fic is abandoned. The presence of
American troops is '' vital element
in this effort. - The services of Mr.
Stevens depend upon it. and in point
of serious moment, the plan proposed
by Japan provides that Mr. Stevens
and all foreign relief war experts
shall be' withdrawn 'when the troops
are withdrawn..
"Victory Buttons"
Ready for Soldiers
Victory buttons are now ready for
those who served in the war, accord
ing to an announcement made yester
day by Captain Patrick of the quarter
master corpa at Douglas. There are
two kinds of buttons, the silver ones
for those who were wounded and the
bronze for all others. These buttons
will be distributed by Captain Patrick
at the quartermaster department at
Douglas, back of the Y. M. C. A. build
ing. It is necessary for the person re
questing the button to present his
his discharge papers. If the papers are
correct a button will be Issued.
Realizing that the men are desirous
of securing the buttons, Captain Pat
rick said that there will be no delay
in issuing them, but it will be abso
lutely necessary to present the dis-
cnarge certificates before he can give
them out.

from twelev to eighteen months to eradicate. I have great faith in Number

my friends.. I know of two men working with me who are now taking it
with splendid results." Yours very truly, George Nicholson, Witness to

Charlie Chaplin In
Tombstone Court
How universally the movies have
made their impression was well illus
trated in the trial of Aniel Alezo
yesterday in Tombstone. A brlgni
Mexican hoy, ten or eleven years ot
age. Santa Ana Murretta by name,
had testified that a man about the
defendants place was drunk, upon
cross-examination Attorney Gibson
asked the boy how the intoxicated
man walked, and the boy said "Like
Charlie Chaplin." Mr. Gibson con
fessed that he was not up on tne
movies, so the boy, upon request ot
Assistant County Attorney McKel
ligon, arose from the witness chair
and gave a very good imitation of the
ubiquitious Charlie. He drew a big
laugh from the spectators, . and no
doubt left the impression he wished
to convey of just how a drunken
man walks.

the league for a long time only
dropping out a few days ago. Jim
Thorpe, who never could hit with the
Giants, is heading the procession in
the national.
Lats year Peckinpaugh batted .231;
Johnson .227, and Thorpe .248.
All three men are veterans and last
year's batting figures just about rep
resent their work for the years they
have been in the major leagues.
Maybe a change in pasture helped
Thorpe. He went from the Giants to
the Braves and immediately began
to hit.
There is no particular reason for
Peckinpaugh increasing his gait. His
manager. Miller Huggins, said:
"Peck just started hitting and his
confidence increased to such an ex
tent that now it looks as if he'd keep
if, up. He never adopted a new style
at the plate just confidence."
Miller continued to say that in his
estimation Peckinpaugh was the best
short-stopper in the game today. In
the field he always was regarded a
w-onder and he's now hitting harder
than any other shortfielder.
' Maybe Doc Johnston put forth a
superhuman effort to keep Guisto or
Joe Harris from crowding him out ot
his job at first for the Indians. Doc
was the only first sacker on the job
this spring, Guisto and Harris report
ing later. "It was generally conceded
that Doc would hit the bench soon as
either of the missing two turned up.
But Doc has the job and as long "as
he can hit in the .300 class he'll prob
ably keep it. Doc has been playing
a hangup game in all departments.
Peckinpaugh and Johnston are
Slipping and the old hitsmiths are
crowding to the front. Joe Packson
with .354 and Cobb and Veach . with
.348 each are at the top.

j MORE WAGES FOR MINERS AND SMELTERMEN. j
THE ANNOUNCEMENT that the mining companies in the
Warren district, operating mines there and reduction works
in this city have decided to grant a material raise in wages
to miners and smeltermen will be gratifying not only to
those who are to receive this increased pay but also to all those who
must depend on the patronage of these men for the successful opera
tion of business enterprises of every kind. When the market price
of copper began to advance this wage increase was expected; this
had been promised in previous statement accompany the reduction
of wages last winter because of the slump in the price of the red
metal and because it has ever been recognized that the companies
at Bisbee have always kept the wage scale above many othr copper
production districts in the country.
The regard always shown by the Copper Queen, C. & A. and
Shattuck companies in the Warren district for the welfare of their
employes has been so generally recognized that in the past all at
tempts of the radical labor agjiator to bring about any serious dis
satisfaction in that district have been failures. This is the best evi
dence of the fairness of the companies and the desire of the majority
of miners in Bisbee to accept this fair treatment in good faith and
refuse to listen to the I. W. W. and their radical kind.
" Good Old Bisbee! It has grown into one of the greatest mining
districts in the country and both employer and employee have al
ways worked together and each for the benefit of the other. Of
course there has, in recent years, been some disturbing radicals there,
but at no time has that element had a chance to destroy the in
dustries upon which all are depending for progress and prosperity.
Everybody should be glad to see the old time and loyal employes
In the mines and smelters in this mining section receive a better
wage which will enable them to weather the high cost of living and
provide some assurance that wages will be further increased Bhould
the price of copper continue to advance. (Douglas International).
A TYPICAL "KIDNAPPER.
If
SAM FRANKENl.ERG, of Frankenberg Brothers & Newman, Bis
bee, was one of the deportation defendants in court in this
city last week. Mr. Frankenberg has been one of the useful
and worthy citizens of Bisbee for two decades of time, a man
who has used his brain and his energy for the upbuilding of the min
ing industry and business enterprises of the Warren district. He has
never depended on the mining companies for support or favor, but
has, with his business associates built up a mercantile business al
most the enual of any in the state. No man stands higher in rating
for prominence in the business and social life of Bisbee than Sam
Frankenberg and it -is no surprise that he was found among those
in the trying and troublesome days in Bisbee in 1917 who was willing
to stay the hand of anarchy and destruction. (Douglas International)

MINERS UNION NOT
IN I. W. W. STRIKE.
MIAMI, July 24. The union men
of the Miami district are today thor
oughly aroused and are expressing
themselves in the strongest condemn
atory . language at their command
over the' attempt of a handful of
tramp I. W. W. leaders who have
flocked into the district within the
last five or six days to pull a strike
here.
Officers of the Miami Miners' union
and the Globe-Miami Labor union are
indignant over the attempt of this
savory bunch who represent nothing
and live nowhere to kick up a rumpus
here and disorganize industrial con
ditions as well as the labor unions
themselves.
Officers of the Miami Miners union
say that the demands formulated by
Micky Scanlon and his I. W. W. fol
lowers who came into the district
with him recently have not been pre
sented to the Miners' union and the
union wag not consulted in the mat
ter, in fact was kept ignorant of the
matter until the wobbly meeting was
pulled off in Bloody Tanks wash. It
is also stated by the officers of the
Globe-Miami Central Labor union
that they were not taken into the con
fidence of the would-be strike leaders
and had no intimation that a strike
was to be attempted.
The officers of both these labor or
ganizations say that the present
movement is nt a genuine attempt to
better conditions of labor but is a
political scheme on the part of the
I. W. W.
to be started on the Mesa-Tempe
road within 60 days, it was said by
State Engineer Maddock yesterday.
The state highway department has re
ceived a wire from J. S. Bright, dis
trict engineer of the bureau of post
roads at Denver, stating that the
plans and specifications have been
accepted and will be sent to Wash
ington. The only change made in the speci
fications by the bureau was the in
creasing of the depth of bitulithic
pavement from six to seven inches,
to equal in their opinion, a six-inch
solid concrete base and a Warrenite
top.
The first bids received have been
rejected and new bids will be asked
immediately on the basis of the new
specifications. The plans have also
been changed to reduce the width of
the road from 20 to 18 feet.

PINAL BOND ISSUE
TIES IN WITH PLANS
FOR STATE HIGHWAY
PHOENIX, July 24. In the million
dollar bond issue submitted to the
people by the Pinal county board ot
supervisors,' the provision of $150,000
for the Florence-Superior road is de
signed to fit in with the program of
the state ' highway department and
was included by the Pinal board in
accordance with an . agreement be
tween it and State Engineer Maddock.
The $150,000 will be coupled with an
equal amount of federal aid, accord
ing to the program, and the $300,000
total applied on the road from Flor
ence to the Junction of the Mesa
Superior' highway and from the junc
tion to Superior. This junction is 14
miles east of Mesa. The state will
build to that point.
As work is now progressing favor
ably on the section from Superior to
Globe, this arrangement will assure
the completion of the middle east and
west highway from Phoenix to Globe.

Mayor's Salary $3,600.
The charter fixes the mayor's sal-
! ary at $3,600 a year and makes his
tenure of office four years. A lively
discussion was provoked by this
clause, opinions of the commissioners
differing as to the length of term,
amount of pay and amount of time
the chie'f magistrate should devote to
the office to earn said pay., A pro
posed amendment cutting down the
term to two years was lost. Mr. Gold
stein thought site hours a day was the
least possible time the mayor should
spend in his office. Mr. Fishburn
argued that service could not be
measured by the clock and that there
would be many times when the mayor
in the proper discharge of his duties"
would put in a double working day
of eight hours. The opinion was
voiced that $3,600 a year would
scarcely pay for the excluisve time
of a valuable man, "but a motion mak
ing the yearly stipend $4 000 was
lost. The article was finally carried
as written with the amendment that
the mayor devote all of his time to
the office.
TAUGHT GERMANS POKER.
TUCSON, July 24. How poker
came to Coblenz and chased fear
away was described yesterday by
Captain Minge. formerly city electri
cian, lately of the 29th engineers, Co.
C, who arrived home a few days ago.
"Before we entered the city," he
said, "the Germans had been told the
Yankees barbecued the children,
abused the women and murdered the
men.
"So when we were, billeted in a
home, we only saw an old man or old
woman; never the family. We didn't
understand, of course.
"After a few days, during which
you could see they were waiting for
us to break loose, they would send
the children out where we could see
them. Of course, most of us welcom
ed the children and we used to play
with them, bought them candy and
things, and trotted them on our
knees, making up for youngsters left
behind. When the children reported
our treatment, we got a glimpse of
perhaps the mother, in the near dis
tance. Then, by and by. the girls oi
the families would appear. That was
the last chance they took. It wasn't
more than a few days after that we
were sitting with them teaching them
poker."

REPORTS MOHAVE IS
BOOMING BUT BOOZE
BUSINESS ON WANE.
PHOENIX, July 24. Sheriff W. P.
Mahoney of Mohave county was in
the city yesterday, as an escort to a
citizen who had been committed to
the hospital for the insane. The vic
tim was a sufferer from the "flu."
As in several other cases from that
part of the country, insanity was a
sequel- of the disease.
But. said the sheriff, all the peo
ple of Mohave have not gone crazy;
ihey were never better mentally,
physically and financially than they
are now. More work is going on in
the mines than ever before gold,
silver, copper and lead. The gold
mines of Mohave are the richest on
the continent.
Since Sheriff Mahoney took hold,
there has been a lessening of boot
legging through that country, which
had Tjeen previous to that the boot
leggers' chief highway, the camino
real. Probably more whiskey crossed
Mohave than any other subdivision
of a dry state in the United States.
Bootlegging had beeji reduced to an
established industry. There was seven
a bootleggers union.
But all that has been changed. The
stuff the sheriff has captured would
equip a distillery, and many a man
in Phoenix .and Prescott has gone
dry in consequence or his activities.
Four carloads have been intercept
ed by the sheriff ami his deputies
during the present month, which has
a week yet to run.

VITAL SERVICE
Boston Transcript:
All the packers also emphasize the
importance of the service they render
to the community. The importance of
the service is of course conceded.
That is what makes the whole subject
so vital. The butcher and the gro
cer perform a highly important ser
vice to the citizens, but that is no
reason why they should overcharge
him, and he cannot be accused of in
gratitude if he protests when they
do overcharge him. Nor can he be
blamed for desiring that the butcher
and the grocer shall have conipeti

JAPAN'S OPPORTUNITY
New York Tribune:
Jajan can save the situation, and
only Japan; this, by reverting to her
1914 principles and declaring that,
without delay, she will return to
China what belong to the Chinese.
No sympathy is to be given to blan
ket charges against Japan, such as
that she seeks to make , "slaves" of
40,000,000 Chinese. ' Japan's leader
ship would probably help rather than
harm the Chinese. But . this has
nothing to do with the present con-,
troversy. The obvious solution is a I
definite undertaking to evacuate
Shantung at an early and specified
date.
AJO RAILROAD
TO GULP SURE,
TUCSON BELIEF
TUCSON, Ariz.. July 25. That El
Paso and all Arizona and the south
west will soon be connected, with the
Gulf of California and through it,
w-ith the Pacific ocean, is the report
here, generally credited.
James Douglas is reported to have
renewed the old plan of Frank Mur
phy to build an American railroad to
a point on the Gulf of California, to
give a terminus for the southwestern
country at tide water and remove it
from the mercy of tho Southern Pa
cific at Los Angeles.
Mr. Douglas is reported to have
completed arrangements for harbor
facilities on the north end of the Gulf
of California, and to have all but
completed his plans for financing the
road. It is the plan to build, it is
said, from Ajo. He has arranged, it
is said, to get his harbor facilities on
the Lower California side of the Gulf
rather than on the Sonora side, by
reason of the fact that Lower Calif
ornia has very little to do with the
mother country of Mexico and Gov.
Cantu is able to maintain peace and
control his state fairly well.
As the El Paso & Southwestern
railroad has already built a branch
to Ajo from the Southern Pacific, it
is only necessary to connect up Ajo
with the Gulf of California to give a
new outlet for El Paso, Douglas and
all of Arizona and New Mexico to
the Pacific ocean. It is reported that
the El Paso & Southwestern, even
though it has an agreement with the
Southern Pacific for the use of its
tracks west of Tucson, would build
from Tucson to Ajo in event that Mr.
Douglas builds to the Gulf of Calif
ornia. This would give a through
short route from Chicago, .KansaB
City and St. Louis, through El Paso
for the Rock Island and Southwest
ern to the Pacific ocean.
It was though at one time that the
Southwestern would build from Tuc
son to Yuma to a connection with
the Spreckel road from San Diego,
but the Southern Pacific long ago
gained control of the Spreckel road
and when that is completed to Yuma,
it merely means another S. P. con
nection with the Pacific.
The building of a line to the Gulf
of California from Ajo and the build
ing of the Southwestern branch from
Tucson to a point where its present
Ajo branch connects with the S. P.
would give a new through line to
tidewater and competition for the S.
P. of a real character.
On the face of it. the whole plan
sounds feasible, people say who
should know.

to declare war, a waiver of the Mon
roe doctrine and a quitclaim deed of
our national independence. These he
asks the senate to sign. All that
America had expected to get from the
peace conference was honor; and
that, as Senator Williams practically
admits, was forgotten in the bargaining.

THE URGENT DUTY(
Philadelphia Public Ledger: '
President Wilson returns to take
up the routine duties of his office;
but the greater and more urgent duty
that confronts him is to interpret to
his own people the work of the peace
conference and to strengthen their
faith in the sincerity and good inten
tions of the Allies in the rraming of
the peace terms and in the creation
of the instrument by which the peace
is to be made permanent. He comes

things, some hustling must be done.
The most important business to
night will be the reports of the dele
gates to the Tucson convention and
the ratification or the contsitutioa
and resolutions of the national or
ganization. The American Lesion is
an organization composed of Ameri
can's fighting forces in the world war,
and the resolutions adopted by the
St. Louis convention reflect the spirit
of the men who compose the order.
Its principles are the principles of
Americanism, and every man who is
eligible is asked to affiliate with the
organization and use his best efforts
toward its advancement.
Tells of Experience
On War Transport
Prof. L. C. Lockwood of the Univer
city of Tucson gave a lecture to the
students of the summer session of the
university school here, in the audito
rium of the High school last evening.
He told 'of t he experiences with the
transport service on the Atlantic dur
ing the' war, in which service he was
an officer. Many interesting affairs
were told a large aud appreciative
audience in a very forceful manuer
aud everyone agreed that he had goue
through a wonderful experience.
DOUGLAS, July 25. J. P. Sexton
of this city, captain of the team that
will represent the state of Arizona at
the national rifle matches to be held
at Caldwell, N. J., near New York
City, beginning August 4 and ending
August 30, will leave here next
Thursday night for El Faso. Mem
bers of the team from various parts
of the state, will meet in El Paso
Friday and go to Caldwell in a body.
There will be 17 members of the
Arizona team, the same as from ev
ery other Etate in the UMion, though
some of the large states are entering
tour or five teams, but only one will
be recognized as the official team.
Mr. Sexton and Harry Reynolds are
tin; Douglas representatives on the
Arizona team, though it is still hoped
to make arrangements for Charles
Risgs to go as a member of the team,
as he is one of the best shots in the
state. He is now at Nacozari and it
is feared will not be able to make
the trip.
Ex-Sheriff Harry C. Wheeler and
H. C. Aimj will go as members ot
the state team from Tombstone, and
Col. George J. Roskruge, of Tucson,
dean of rifle shots iu Arizona, will go
as quartermaster.
He was designated by Governor
Campbell to choose and take charge
of the team, and iu turn he appointed
Mr. Sexton as capiain.
The shooting competition i nation
wide in scope and will be conducted
by the United States government.
The men representing the various
stales will get transportation, equip
ment, meals and lodging from the
government while away. Civilian
and military marksmen will not only
compete among themselves, but with
one another, and the' competition
will bring out the best marksmen in
the entire country. There will be
new matches, in various kinds ot
shooting and at various distances., ev
ery other day, with from 1.000 to
2.000 marksmen participating. Those
who make the best scores will there
fore achieve a real honor.
The Arizona team which went to
Camp Perry, Ohio, last year, mad
a good record, though it is hoped to
surpass that record this year. Iast
year, Riggs. of Douglas, made the
highest, .score in, blow fire pistol
shooting at the 'meet." ! 1

Mining and Financial News
BY REVIEW
STOCKS AND BONDS
NEW YORK, July 25. Trading on
the stock exchange today was charac
terized by comparative dullness and
irregularity. Total transactions bare
ly exceeded one million shares, which
repeated the smallest full session in
many weeks.
In many respects dealing were re
miniscent of mid-summer markets of
previous years. The ebb and flow of
prices ranging in some instances to
5 points, bore no definite relation to
current developments and little atten
tion was paid to events in the broader
field of finance.
Distinctive features were lacking in
the day's operations, aside from the
temporary activity of rails at 1 to 3
point gains and a broader inquiry for
food and copper issues, where extreme
gains were relatively moderate.
Otherwise the market was again
made up largely of steels, equipments,
oils, motors, tobaccos and shippings,
with a sprinkling of unclassified
shares, including textiles and distill
ing issues.
Elastic conditions ruled in the bond
market, domestic and foreign is
sues, including the Liberty group,
easing slightly. Total sales, par value,
f8.750.000. Old United States bond3
unchanged on call.

and unchanged.

Copper, quiet; electrolytic, spot

September 24c.
BUSINESS EXPANSION CONTINUE
NEW YORK, July 25. Dun's, to
morrow will say:
"The really noteworthy feature of the
business situation is not the fact that
activities are. enlarging, but rather
than the expansion continues with so
little sign of abatement. During the
summer period, when a distinct pause
is witnessed, retarding elements such
as the disquieting labor unrest and a
protracted wet spell along the At
lantic coast have not been without
influence, but there is no general
slackening of progress. Where im
mediate wants have been largely fill
ed by the recent vigorous purchasing
there is less eagerness among buyers
and some lines are quieter, yet few
sellers are obliged to seek an outlet
for their products and not a few or
them are booked ahead as far as they
care to be.
"Weekly - bank celaring were, $7,
683,352,544."
WOOL PRICES TEND UPWARD
BOSTON, July 25. The Commercial
Bulletin tomorrow will say:
"The demand for wool continues
steadily and prices, while not mate
rially higher, are tending upwards.
The mills are showing more interest
in the lower grade wools. '
"The tone has Improved in the Lon
don auctions and at the River Platte
prices are rising. German demanrl

THE GRAIN MARKETS
CHICAGO, July 25. Although con
tinued drought and heat put the bears
at a disadvantage in the corn market
today, buyers were more than usually
cautious owing to absence as yet of
any reports of notable crop damage.
The market closed unsettled, 1 cent
down to a like advance, with Septem
ber $1.95 to $1.95 and December
$1.65 to $1.65. Oats Ac to
c down. Provisions varying from
40c decline to a rise of 50c.
With temperature above normal and
no rain in sight few traders cared to
sell short in the corn market. This
was especially the case at first. Later,
however, cloudy conditions here in
duced many holders to unload rather
than take chances of the effect that
a sudden shower might have on senti
ment. ,
Absence of export call tended to
weaken oats and so too did a moderate
amount of hedging. Provisions wero
governed mainly by changes in the
value of corn imd hogs, and for the
most part were sagging at the close.

BISBEE LEGION
TO HOLD BEET
SUNDAY NIGHT
The next regular meeting of the
American Legion of Bisbee will be
held Sunday night at the Elks club,
at which time the nomination for offi
cers of the local post and the report
of the various committee will be
heard. A name will be Belected for
the post and many other matters af
fecting the local organization will be
brought up. .
The returned service men of Lowell
have been discussong the possibility
of organizing a local post there, but
it is said that the state organization
will not issue a charter for another
post located within four miles of one
already organized.
The post organized in Bisbee is not
for Bisbee men alone, but is for the
entire Warren district. The main idea
of the Lowell men was to have some
organization there which could furnish
some sort of a club house and while
a club house for Lowell is a
much needed improvement it appears
as if they will be unable to secure a
charter under the state by-laws.
Among those who have joined the
Warren district post during the past
week are W. H. "Wilson. G. A. Hills
man, J. R. Murray, W. B. Bayes, H. G.
Hershell, Joe Smith, H. H. Givens,

OF Hl-Y GIRLS
The Hi Y cabaret at the Y. W. C. A.

cording to a statement by Miss Gree
ley, girls' secretary, last evening.
The entertainment was given for
tlie benefit of the girl's activity fund
and about $125 was takeu in at the
. gate and the ice cream stands, so that
the girls feel that they were more
than repaid for the hard work "which
was necessary in preparing the caba
ret features.
Probably the most attractice fea
ture of the evening was the popular
jazz number by Gerard Downs and his
chorus of pretty girls. The girls were
costumed in the popular conoeption
of choruB girl wardrobe and with the
varied colors and pretty faces, the
guests were delighted with the num
ber. Ethel Warner and. Mildred Smith
were very pleasing in their rendition
of the latest popular "rags" in beau
tiful costumes and. the Oriental dances
by Inez Gill, Lassie Campbell and
Marie Buckett was oriental in every
detail performed in excellent style
j with appropriate costumes.
Familiar negro melodies were ren
dered by Myrtle Treat and Viola

reminded one of the forgotten days
of early California.'

BISBEE ROAD
DOUGLAS, July 25. Deputy Sher
iff Sam Boucher, one of whose duties
is to see that the speed limit on the
highway betwevn Douglas and Bis
bee is not exceeded, says that many
Douglas motorists are showing a dis
position to exceed the speed limit on
the new paved section. With a few
exceptions, Mr. Boucher has confined
his activities so far to advising peo
ple to slow down and warning them
of the speed law, but says that in
the future he will arrest all viola-j
tors, in accordance with his sworn'
duty. I
The speed limit on the highway is
30 miles an hour, and this is fast
enough for anybody to go, in the
opinion of the lawmakers, though the
new paved road is a great temptation
to motorists to "open her up. The
paved road is now open about a mile

stretch will be opened. Since it was
paved, there has been more traffic
over this end of the road thaa ever
before, though mo?t of the increase
is by pleasure cars in the evening.
Mr. Boucher patrols the road in
the evening on his motorcycle, and
is also on the job at various times
during the day. It is never safe for
speeders to count on his absence for
he comes "like a thief in the night."
Persons arrested for speeding on
