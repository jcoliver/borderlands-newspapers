Be Asked to Accept or Re

Program Not Made
Public By Sponsor
Refusal to Be Party to the
Shantung Settlement Said
To Be One of the Changes
Planned; McCumber Active
WASHINGTON, Oct'21 The ques
tion of accepting peace treaty reser
vations without further opposition
was earnestly considered by Demo
cratic senate leaders today under
the pressure of developments point
ing to an early showdown in the rati
fication fight. '
The treaty opposition forces, an
nouncing at last a complete agree
ment on a reservation program by
the senate majority, brought the sit
uation to an unexpected issue by
serving notice that their proposal
would go before the foreign relations
committee tomorrow, when the ad
ministration leaders would be asked
to go oil record definitely as accept
ing or rejecting it.
Described by the majority spokes
men as in the nature of an ultimatum,
the announcement was followed by
a conference on the administration
side which lasted all day, but result
ed in no final decision. Senators
who were present said that while
some of the leaders stood out de
terminedly against any compromise,
there was an apparent disposition on
the part of Senator Hitchcock and
others to consider seriously the prac
ticability of such a step.
The reservation program as it is
to be presented to the committee for
approval was not made public, but
it was understood to embrace nine
reservations, evolved from sugges
tions gathered from many sources.
The subjects said to be covered were
the following:
The right of this country to judge
whether its obligations had been ful
filled in case of withdrawal from the
league of nations; the unimpaired
power of congress to decide ques
tions of peace or war under article
ten; domestic decision of all domes
tic questions; preservation unaffect
ed of the Monroe doctrine; refusal
to be a party to the Shantung set
tlement; equalization of voting
power in the league; congressional
selection of American representa
tives and those on international com
missions and nullification of the
right of the international labor con
ference to challenge the eligibility of
American representatives in interna
tional labor bodies.
The disturbing element in this pro
gram for the administration leaders
was the fact that they had heard the
', article ten reservation followed close
ly the language of one presented in
the senate during the day by Sena
tor McCumber, Reimblican of North
TiaVntn whirh In turn was in almost
the exact language which President j
Wilson announced in his Cheyenne,
.Wyo., address, would be. regarded by
him "as a rejection of the treaty."
Behind the majority's proposals,' it
is declared by their sponsors, will
stand all of the 49 Republicans and
at least six Democrats, leaving as a
maximum forty-one Democrats op
DosinE them. In these circumstances
the administration managers were!
told their only hope of defeating the
program was to'(vote against ratifi
cation Hfter the . reservations have
been put into the ratification resolu
tion. Somfi of the Democrats want
to pursue that course, ancT tbe gen
eral prediction tonight was that com-'
mittee action would be fought off
tomorrow togive the administration
forces a day or two to think the mat
ter over. In their conference today
the Democratic leaders did not have
before them the actual wording of
the reservations, as agreed on by the

Industrial Conference Is at
Starting Point; Rejection
of . Collective Bargaining
Causes Another Deadlock
WASHINGTON, Oct. 21. After a
day of uncertainty, during which
President Wilson sent to Secretary
Lane a message of conciliation to be
used as a "last resort," the national
industrial conference tonight cleaned
its slate by rejecting all collective
bargaining resolutions as well as the
labor proposal or Intervention in
the steel strike.
The public group "aligned with cap
ital on the vote against both the
original collective bargaining and
steel strike resolutions, although the
declaration on collective bargaining
was proposed by the public delegates.
Prior to the vote on the original de
clarations, the employers' substitute
and two new amendments by Thomas
L. Chadbourne, chairman of the con
ference's central committee, met de
feat. Only the employers favored
the substitute, an'd labor and capital
united in the opposition to the amend
ments. When the conference reconvenes
tomorrow it will be in practically
the same position as at the opening.
In adjourning the session tonight,
Secretary Lane declared that the con
ference , had produced nothing and
advised it to take a. new start by
adjourning for several days, while a
co-ordinating committee of not more
than six members framed a program

ers and their sympathizers clashed
with several workmen who had just
left one of the plants shortly before
7 o'clock. One man was shot and
many others injured.
Mounted state troopers rushed to
the scene and rode into the mob, using
clubs freely. When the troopers put
in an appearance, the crowd greeted
them with a shower of stones, clubs
and bottles and an unidentified man
drew a revolver and fired five shots,
cne of which struck Jack Dinnock.
The troopers finally dispersed the
mob and arrested two men, who reg

WASHINGTON. Oct. 21. While
President Wilson was able to for
mulate a message to Secretary Lane
for transmission to the national in
dustrial conference no effort was
made either by Rear Admiral Gray
son, his physician, or by White
House officials, to create the impres
sion that the action was indicative
of . a decided improvement in the
president's condition. ,
Writing of the message, however,
was pointed to by members of the
White House staff as further refut
ing reports that Mr. Wilson was un
able to transact any necessary bus
iiess that might require his atten
tion as chief executive. The situa
tion confronting the national indus
trial conference, or which may face
it at any time through danger of its
dissolution, was considered as con
stituting such a necessity.
While the president, it was said
air the White House, was no dorse
today, his condition did not show
any decided change for the better
as might be inferred from his in
creasing activity in government af
fairs. Dr. Grayson made it plain that he
does not propose to let the incident
of the message serve as a prece
dent for lowering the bars to all
who may have affairs of state to
bring before the patient. The grad
ual improvement in the president's
condition has been noted, but it was
again emphasized the daily change
is so slight as to be almost imper
ceptible and is to be measured at
first more by the absence of com
plications than by signs, of returning
strength..

Chairman Appealed to By
Thayer to Assist Operating
NEW YORK, Oct. 21. Publishers
of approximately 150 periodicals and
trade papers having headquarters in
this city, who suspended publication
several weeks ago because of labor
difficulties, decided late today to re
sume publication "at once, either in
New York or elsewhere."
This annouueement was made by
John Adams Thayer, secretary of the
New ' York Publishers' committee,
after a meeting attended by most of
the publishers who, on September 15,
decided upon suspension . "until such
time as the printing industry in New
York could be stabilized."
The labor difficulties began when
certain locals, in defiance of their
international leaders, called a strike
for increased wages and shorter
hours. This was followed by . other
workers taking unauthorized "vaca
tions" until the publishers decided
to' shut down.
In ai letter seit today to William
Green, chairman of the printers
league committee of the Association
of Employing Printers, Mr. Thayer
authorized Green to "give all possi
ble assistance to those publishers
who desire to issue tfreir publica
tions temporarily outside of New
York.

The admiralty, however, expects
that Kronstadt will surrender soon
after Petrograd is captured, probably
to the British fleet in those waters.

His Ptories were both pathetic and

soldier along the western front.
Wolf, who enlisted from BIsbee,
traveled through England, Franco,
Belgium, Italy and Germany as an

adventures were those taking place
in the Argonne forest, where he was
with those troops that led the allies

WASHINGTON, Oct. 21. Failure of
operators and miners to settle their
"differences after a four-hour confer
ence today with Secretary Wilson may g
force the government to step in and
1 ber l.
Although another effort will be
made tomorrow to bring peace to the
industry, the strike tonight loom
ed big and close at hand and leaders
of both sides, speaking frankly-and
gravely, said there was little hope.
While the full scale committees
representing miners and operators
were fighting their battles today be
hind a closed door, a strike storm rag-
, . ' , , , ,
i ed iu the senate and federal aencis
looked up the law, firmly convinced
it would have to be invoked to save
the country from untold distress and
suffering, with mines shut down and
less than a month's stock on hand to
keep fires burning.
Filing out ot the meeting place, the
miners and operators, nearly one hun
dred of them, wen their separate
ways to discuss the crisis, the former
led by John L. Lewi3, president of the
United Mine Workers of America, and
the latter by Thomas T. Brewster,
head of the operators' association.
Leaders and members of both groups
Were extrremely reticent. Both
Brewster and Lewis refused to dis
cuss the situation beyond saying there
had been no change in the attitude of
either group.
Informed of the attack on the unions
in the senate by Senator Frelinghuy
sen of New Jersey, and reports from
manv miiirtora that tht iznvtrnmnt
intervene, strike leaders said
there was a bare chance of some en-
couraging development tomorrow, but
that the strike order would stand.
Secretary Wilson left tne meeting
without giving the least intimation as
to what was in his mind as to hope of
settlement
The two committees, in separate
groups, filed into the assembly hall of
the Red Cross building and sat down
shortly before noon while Secretary
Wilson went to the front and without
ceremon announced that they hady
had been asked to meet and adjust
their grievances. Pleading for imme

how it would affect the public, how
it would close industrial plants and

NZA VICTIM Gil
Bf DISTRICT RELIEF ASSOCIATION
What is declared t have been one
of the most urgent cases to be
brought before the Warren District
Relief association during the month,
and to be also an indication or what
may be expected here with the coin
in gor the winter months, with spe
cial fererence to "victims of influenza
last yeaf, was taken care of by the
association yesteraay.
The case was that of a young man,
23 years of age, who contracted in
fluenza in Columbus, O., on Oecem
ber 6, 1918. From that day until
August 30, 1919, heywas in the hos
pital. His lungs had always been
weak, and, haying lost his parents
'when he was a child, he had never
had an opportunity to correct his
sickly condition. After his dismis-
sal from the hospital at olumbus, the
physicians there advised him to go
. to Arizona. He was also told that
one of the physicians had a brother

gether enough money, as he thought,
to completethe Journey, but was
stranded in Douglas. He applied for
help there, but was directed to Bis
bee. Yesterday afternoon he ap
peared before Miss Esther Cum
mines. eeneral secretary of the as
sociation, and told his story. He was
' wan and emaciated, but made no re
' quest for food until the secretary,
noticing his weakness, asked him
' when he had eaten. He replied that
. he had had no food since Saturday, j
He was immediately given assist
ance, and left last night for Phoenix,
where he hopes to obtain permanent
relief.
Another case brought to the at
tention of the association was that
of an ex-service man. who has just
been dismissed from Camp Whipple",
the government sanitarium at Pres
cott, where he had been in bed for
two months and a half. . He came to
Bisbee in a destitute condition, and
assitsance is now bein ggiven him
by the association and the local
branch of the American Red Cross.
In discussing these two cases, of
ficials of the association said yes
terday that mafiy more of the same
nature may be expected iu Bisbee
during the next few months. As is
well known, those who contracted
influenza during the epidemic E
erally have found themselves in a
weakened condition afterwards, and if
they are poorly nourished or with
out the means of taking care of
themselves properly, the Coming of
the cold months may have serious
effects upon them.
Tho association, therefore is ask
ing the people of the Wafren district
to assist in handling the cases as
they come in. It is impossible to
md them -away without reief, but, at
the same time, that relief requires
money, and the financial help must
come from the citizens of this city,
who, through the association, were
able to do so much good in the cases
which came .to fhe association yesterday.
Conference Again

ing lost the support of the public
group, which heretofore has been on
the side of the workers, the labor
delegates left the confernce hall to
night disheartened and feeling, as
some of them said, that little could
. be gained by further meetings. How
ever, a meeting of the group has
been called for 9 o'clock tomorrow
morning and individual members
will be bound by action taken at
that time.
Should labor show a disposition to
bolt the conference, Chairman Lane
ultimately will use the president's
letter in an effort to avert the crisis.
Reading of the letter was said to be
entirely discretionary with the chair-j
man, who declared that hei would .
not produce it unless the situation
became acute. Although labor may
force the disclosure of its contents,
. it was generally predicted tonight
. that the workers would not with
draw. The president's message, it
was understood, restates the purpose J
for which the conference was con-

the need for allaying industrial un
"rest, and makes a plea for further
work on the part of the conferees.
The morning session of the con
ference lasted only a few minutes,
Und the tfternoon meeting .during
which quick action was obtained,
was not convened until five o'clock.
The entire day was devoted to group
meetings in an attempt to devise an
other declaration on collective bar
gaining, satisfactory to all elements.
After more than three days of al
most continuous sessions, the em
ployers were unable to agree "upon
another statement, and fell back on
the Wheeler substitute.
Members of the public group at
tempted to effect a compromise by
the substitution of the words "asso
ciations of their own choosing" for
"trade and labor unions" in the
clause of the groups resolution
guaranteeing workers the right to or
ganize, and the rive labor represen
tatives on the general committee of
fifteen spent two hours in joint
meeting with the 'public explaining
labor's objection to the change. This
statement was introduced by Mr.
Chadbourne, but the ' public group
alone voted favorably.
When the original Russell-Endi-
cott resolution came up for discus
sion in the conference, Samuel Gom-
pers, president of the American Fed
eration of Labor, declared tnai me
withdrawal of the support of the
public group was due to an interpre
tation of the words "trade and labor
unions" by one member of the group,
who is allied with organized labor,
.and that the phrase excludes all, but
, American Federation of Labor organ
izations. It was said that the refer
ence was to J. J. Forrester, alternate
for L.M. Jewell, acting president of
the Railway Employes' department
of the federation.
The right to organize fof the put
pose of collective bargaining, Mr.
Gonipers continued, "is the one ques
tion in controversy the one thing
' the working people of the United
'States are going to achieve."
A hush fell over the crowded audi
torium as the labor leader, squarely
facing the employers' wing and shak
ing his finder toward that group, ex
claimed to tho representatives of
American capital:

tors, he charged, had refused to con
sider a new one.
The side of the operators was pre
sented by P. H. Penna, of Terre
Haute, Ind., w ho charged that the min
ers had violated their agrement, that
the operators had adhered to the prin
ciples and practices of collective bar
gaining and that the unions were at
fault. Then without consulting the
leaders. Secretary Wilson suggested
an adjruonment until tomorrow, as
casually as if the conference had
planned to run for a week.
There was no objection', neither side
desiring to appear in the attitude of
blocking peaceful efforts by a volun
tary mediator, but miners and opera
tors were surprised. The general
feeling seemed to be that the thing
would be fought over and settled to
day. The secretary, it was said, indi
cated a desire to present the views of
the government after each side had
been given a full hearing.

the four generally regarded as most
important, relating to withdrawal,
domestic . questions, the Monroe doc
trine and article ten followed "al
most word for word" the language of
those put into the senate record by
Senator McCumber. Most of the
argument, therefore, was over these
four as presented by the "North Da
kota senator.
In all, seven reservations were in
the McCumber series, the other
three relating to Shantung and equal
votes in the league. Mr. McCumber
was one of the seven original "mild
reservationists" who, under the lead
ership of Senator McNary, Republi
can of Oregon, agreed last July to a
definite program. He said the plan
he presented today was the out
growth of conferences between this
group "and Republicans who favored
"stronger reservations."

I had been sick at all. But for several
months previous to the time I got Tan

my stomach was so .weak that I felt

sleep at all, had night eweats. and so
run down and weak that the least ex

I have ever enjoyed sleptng so well
and I always get up mornings feeling

BANKS SEE DANGER
AS WAS POINTED OUT at the recent American Bankers' associa
tion convention at St. Louis, bankers can do all that it is pos
sible Tor the government to do in relieving shortage of dwell
ings and small improved farms. Agitation for amortising real
estate loans was started by a committee of A. B. C. in 1911. This
committee also started the ill-starred rural credits movement that
went wild from being misunderstood and not generally supported by
bankers. Eight years after, the association appointed another amor
tization committee. - -
If the association had never paused there might not have been
a federal farm loan act, nor a North Dakota public bank, nor laws in
Maine and Oklahoma for lending school and public funds in risky
ways, nor constitutional amendments proposed in North Dakota, Cali
fornia, Kansas, Missouri, and Texas, for using cash and Credit of the
state for farm mortgaging.
Banks arc at last awakening to the dangers of continued en
croachment of state and federal competition, which cripples the bank
ing industry and increases taxes by issuance of hundreds of millions
of tax-exempting bonds.
If the socialistic policy tending to federalize the banking indus
try is continued, every citizen in the country will soon be paying
taxes to cover interest on bond issues and overhead charges to
furnish borrowers money at less than cost.
Progressive banks are aiming to fill the field more completely
than ever.
THE SILENT VOTE VS. THE BIG VOTE
TOO MUCH of governmental policy is guided by the Big Noise.
Is it any wonder labor, police, professors or farmers organize to
make the B'g Noise? The Walla Walla Union says: "It often
happens that a small but compact and well organized group can
control legislation and congress, in opposition to the will of the silent
and unorganized mass of the people.
"The politician feels the pressure of the small but active or
ganization, and knows that if he votes against it, he may lose the
solid block of their votes.
'Ho thinks that the rest of the people "vill forget about it before
the next election. ( But frequently they don't." , . . .
The great mass of silent' citize'ns "should make their opinions
felt more cle;:rly. at elections by choosing men of sound convictions
rather than candidates with the most theories and the loudest nclse.
AUTOCRACY IN NORTH DAKOTA
UNDER the North Dakota plan the state. will absolutely control all
industry, commerce, enterprise and initiative. Nothing which
opposes the non-partisan league will be permitted to stand. As
an instance: The state government of North Dakota selects
one newspaper in esch county as the only one in which public notices
and legal notices can be published. This is already operating to
drive out of business all the press which refused to bow to the
Townley will. It will enable the non-partisan leaguers to feed their
propaganda to North Dakota people and force them to swallow it. It
is easy to see how completely the opposition to non-partisan league
principles will be throttled. Red Lodge, (Mont.) Picket Journal.
THE REAL PURPOSE
THOSE who are inclined Jo sympathize with the steel strikers
should reflect that never has a great strike been so reasonless.
The m?n are striking for the closed shop at a time when tb
wellbeing of the entire country demands the maximum of pro
duction. To select such a cause for striking is an injustice; to choose
such time is criminal. Careful reading of the daily dispatches cannot
have failed to unmask the pretensions of the labor leaders to ulti
mately socialize the steel industry and establish a closed-shop dicta
torship. When agitators clamor for revolutions and strikes, it is
well to remember an old saying that "Men of intemperate minds can
not be free; their passions forge their fetters for them."
WORK, WORK, WORK
INCREASED production as a means of setting the present, indus
trial unrest and the declaration of an industrial truce for six
months as a method of reduling the cost of living were suggested
by W. P. G. Harding, governor of the federal reserve board, in an
address before the convention of I he American bankers' association
at St. Louis. "Work, more work, Is what the country needs. Shorter
hours and increased wages will not increase production."
Authors must abandon Europe as a field of romance. It is pic
turesque, but too many of us have learned that "picturesque" in
cludes the quaint little cootie.
We have serious doubts about the right of people to self-determination
while they can rest content aswann with vermin.
In the old days,i crisis of nny sort got us all excited. But now
v. crisis has 1'ecoine chronic.
It Is a hard job fo rthe average man to put any faith In the al
leged good intentions of a company that works its men 24 nours on
a stretch.
Prices haven't gone up bit faster than our appetite for luxuries.
The trouble is that each class in America thinks that the salva
tion of the country depends upon its successes in getting its own way.
.r Another peculiar tiling about Colonel House is that he has shown
no 'symptoms of writing a book about it.

CLIFTON-FRANKLIN ROAD
TO BE CONCRETED SOON
CLIFTON, Oct. 21. The state high
way department has just issued a
call for bids for the improvement of
the state highway from Clifton to
Frankin. The work involves the
construction of a new highway from
the city limits of Clifton up Ward's
Canyon, joining the present state
highway at the top of the hill.; It
will' result in a shorter -and better
road than the present state highway,
and will follow in a general way the
location of the road used before the
present stale highway was con
structed. 1 ha Ward Cinyon part of the work
will be let as a contract separate and
distinct from the balance of the work.
In addition to the Ward Canyon work
the present temporary bridges be
tween Clifton and Franklin will be
replaced by permanent concrete
structures of the standard type
adopted by the state highway de
partment. A number of concrete
dips will be installed and a few small
line changes will be made. One con
tract will be let for the reinforced
concrete bridges and another con
tract covering a 64-foot steel span
over what is known as Railroad Wash
near Franklin.

The statistics show; that 22,000 per
sons were killed in one year, while
500,000 were laid off. through injur
ies. How can this reckless destruc
tion of lives be averted? It can only
be prevented through education, first
of all through the youngster."
In conclusion, Supt. Tupper ex
pressed the hope. Jhat , the league
would end, not in inere enthusiasm,
but in action.
FATHER WHO WAS SHOT
BY SON PASSES AWAY
PHOENIX. Oct. 21. Frank Patter
son, 58 years of age, passed away at
the Sisters' hospital at 5 o'clock this
morning. Patterson, who owned a
ranch on North Seventh avenue, and
had lived in the valley for the past
two years, had been under the care
of physicians at the hospital since
October 10, when he was shot and
wounded in the abdomen and leg by
his 18-year-old son, Alva Patterson.'
Although it is customary for phy
sicians in case of death from sus
picious cause to notify the county of
ficials immediately after death oc
curs. Coroner Wheeler did not re
ceive such word from Dr. Win Wylie,
the physician in attendance on Pat
terson, but received his first notifi
cation of the death from J. T. Whit
ney, undertaker, at 12 o'clock, after
the body had been sent from the hos
pital to the undertaking establish
ment, and seven hours after death
had occurred.
Coroner Wheeler immediately sent
out a call for a coroner's jury of six
men, and issued subpoenas for Alva
:Ptterson, who confessed to shooting
his father; Harvey Dye, the neighbor
who brought Patterson to the hos
pital afier the shooting: John Doe
and Richard Roe, two Mexicans
working on the Patterson ranch at

PIMA COUNTY MINES
RESUMING OPERATIONS
TUCSON, Oct. 21 The announce
ments last week of the early resump
tion of the Swastika mines, .rich in
silver, the early operation of the Sahu
aro Copper company, and of the first
public offering of stock of the Silver
ita Mining company, all controlled by
local people indicated that the silver
boom is on in Pima county. In con
nection with these announcements
William Kemp has began operations
on the opening of the old Vulcan prop
erties adjoining the Sahuro Copper
company. The Swashika property is
not far distant. The Comababi Mining
company, an incorporation of prop
erty formerly owned zy Richey and
RicJiey, is reported by C. N. Wilson to
bo turning out $450 silver ore.
The Silverita Mining company was
ine of the first of the local companies
to anticipate the demand for silver
when it began in May to open up the
old Spanish silver workings in the Pa
pago district. The company has been
observed more or less closely by the
veteran mining men of Tucson, for the
reason that the property held by the
company, 16 claims at Lincoln camp,
together with the jnillsite and well,
13 of which are aken "under bond and
lease from S. W. Purcell, practically
set the company into' operation, with
substantial, buildings and old shafts in
ore that had been worked' forty years
ago for th highest grade of ore pro
duced in the county, according to Mar
tin Waer, together with old dumps of
good milling ore. Th organizers had
not been identified with mining in the
county.

HIGHWAY COMMISSION
JUMPS OUT OF BOUNDS
GLENDALE. Oct. 21 One of the
most enthusiastic, as. well as one of
the most desperately earnest .meet
ings ever held in Giendale, was the
mass meeting held at the Woman's
club house last night, under the aus
pices of the Giendale Distiict Com
mercial club.
The meeting was an outgrowth of
recent agitation for the building of a
road from Giendale to Phoenix, over
Gr;nd avenue, and followed the ac
tion taken at a regular meeting of
the Commercial club Tuesday night,
when it was decided to call a mass
meeting, asking the Peoria Chamber
of Commerce and others to join with
us in "an, invitation' to the state en
gineer s nd a representative from the
county highway commission to be
present and discuss with the people
the road situation in the Giendale

MESA BUILDING ASSN.
ISSUE STOCK FOR THE PLAN
MESA, Oct. 21. Announcement
that preferred stock with an annual
fixed dividend of eight per cent will
soon be placed on the market, is the
latest development in the organiza
tion and launching here of the South
side Building & Loan Association,
which was placed before the Mesa
public this week. Sale of the pre
ferred stock will be staited within a
short time.
The Interest of the public In the
new organization and the personnel
of the association, is assigned as the
reason for offering this preferred
stock so soon. It had been planned
that these ohares would bo issued at
some date," but when directors of the
new association realized the manner
in which their organization had
reached the public, and the interest
which the public is showing in it,
they determined that the sale could
start almost immediately with assur
ance that the Btock will be taken up
in a short time.
COCHISE COUNTY FORGES
AHEAD IN FARMS, CATTLE
DOUGLAS, Oct. 21. As an evi
dence of the rapid strides made by
Cochise county in the agricultural
and cattle lines of industry, the rec
ords of patents granted to land own
ers, are a glowing argument. Since
the 8th day of August and up to and
including the 15th day of October, 66
patents he.ve been filed with the re
corder. The scramble for land in this
county the past few months has been
furious. The farmer and stockman
has devoted a greater part of his
time to obtaining title to suitable
land, and at the present rate, all land
that will answer either purpose will
be taken up in the very near future.
Most of the land has been fenced,
some obtained by residence as home
stead, and a great acreage leased
from the government under the 20
year payment plan.
Many oil claim locations have also
been filed recently, the last rush be
ing for ground north of Douglas, in
the vicinity of Mud Springs, and in
the foothills of the Swisshelm moun
tains. The day for filing land in Cochise
county is fast passing into history,
which speaks volumes for the pro
gress of farming and stockraising in
the banner county.
WEALTHY MAN LOST
, BOISE. Idaho. Oct. 21. Search for
Joseph .Unger, Pittsburg millionaire,
who has . been lost in the Sawtoot
mountains since October 18, has been
extended uutil nearly every agency the
state has at. its disposal is involved.
Unger was separated from his guTfie
about 40 miics from Mackay and fear
for sis safety, is felt as it was said he
carried about $400 on his peifaou.
When all the luxuries I may have,
Have cloyed my appetite.
And when I turn away and loath
The menu with my might,
There still remains one favored dish,
For which my palate begs,
The good old-fashioned plttter
That is filled with ham and eggs.
Of quail on toast and juicy roasts,
And oysters, too, and fish.
Of all the masterpieces that
An epicure could wish
I've had my fill without complaint.
But still my palate begs,
For just a plute of steaming hot
And savory ham and eggs.
PEPY'S DIARY IN BISBEE
Oct. 21. Up very early, and prepared for a hard day's work, which was
harder than I had expected, duo to the dearth of news and the lack of ex
citement. It was payday, too, but the town was quiet, which grieved me In
a professional sense. To Mrs. Cunningham's again, who has broken one ot
the two glasses which I had seen there before, and who tried to hide it
rrom me. But it is not so badly cracked that it may not. be used, which
shouid be pleasing to her patrons. Also saw Miss Effie Rainey, to whom t
introduced myself, but I think she knew me before I spoke my name, I hav
ing that kind of a face. We talked well for some time, and I bought some
choi '"te,. which I later sat on but gave to the children, who liked it well.
Tn the 'Y,' where I talked about the ncwspai3?r, and surprised that I knew
so much about it. Also the Knights of Columbus, where I watched the
fighters tiain, and much inclined to hit at Loughery's jaw, just to see if 1
could hurt him, but forebore, " lest the consequences be little to my taste.
To the office, where there were many telephone calls, but mostly from people
whom I could understand, which made it pleaeant. Did meet Mr. Eldridge,
or tin! naturalization service, who told me many things about my citizenship
that I did not know before, and which I should remember: Worked Jiard
for a short time, and then to bed, glad to find that the how tie which my
wife had knotted for me early in the day had not become loosened, and re
solving upon a good day coming.
Sixteen Years Ago Today In Bisbee
Turning Back the Calendar
From the Daily Review of October 21, 1903
Capt. Thomas Rynning left Bisbee
last evening in response to a telegram
from Solomonsvllle requesting his
presence as a witness for the prosecu
tion in the case against Francisco Fig
ueroa, the notorious leader of the
armed mob that tried to overpower
the officers at Morenci on the night of
June 9.
"Scott White, the genial and ever
courteous gentleman from Cananea is
here. Scott White, the big hearted
philanthropist, who aids committees
of ministerial-looking gentlemen who
apply to him for assistance in erect
ing schools for homeless children,
dropped into Bisbee last evening and
registered at the Copper Queen hotel.
The transfer men of Bisbee were in
a heap of trouble yesterday. There
was no strike or anything like that,
but there was a decided presence of
scrap. Jack Verfuth is generally a
peaceable king of citizen, but yestere
day he had two fights, in one of which
he was proven the aggressor and
paid a $5 fine, and the other he ap
peared as the principal witness for the
prosecution against one Frank Haines.
Haines also contributed a fiver to the
coffers of justice.

O. M. King, was blown up in the shaft

DISTANT DAYS
By EDMUND VANCE COOKE
There's something briugs it back to me" the quiet, little street.
The swaying tops ofopoplars where we perched our childish feet,
The games we played, tiie sports we hud, the comradeships we knew.
With all the world a story-bcok and all the stories true:
The humble, little cottages, but even the poorest place
Sat snugly in its plot of green aud kept its breathing-space,
And picket palings on the fence kept all misfortune barred.
And morning glories graced the porch and sunllowers decked the anl!
i
U seemed the suu shone every day, and happiness was sure,
And none of us felt poverty, for all of us wero poo;!
And at times the fare was plenty and it times '.he ration lisjht,
But to them both we always brought the sswe sound appetite.
And why the world whs all so fine we bad no mean t.f knowing;
It was enough to lavish and love and reel the joy of growing.
And evMiy day wa3 glorified and every night was starred
With morning glories on the porch and sunflowers in the yard
Well, in the oithostri of life, the mi rest, sweetest strings
Arc those which sing the; pleasures ,t the. simplest. .humblest ihlr.:
And so when I look back today through all the mists or years,
1 feci a laughter in me trembling on the brink ot tears.
And today seems far less certain than that dim and distant wraith
Which somehow brings a coinage, aud which somehow leaves a faith
That Heaven will be an ample place and hell will not be bard.
With morning glories on tho porch and sunflowers In the yard.

GOVERNOR DESIGNATES OCT. 27
AS ROOSEVELT DAY III ARIZONA
Although the local committees in
the drive for funds for the Roosevelt
Memorial have been organized and
In the field only since Monday, more
than $400 has been subscribed, ac
cording to an announcement made last
evening by Ira 13. Joralemon, chair
man. This subscription has come
from about 400 subscribeds, making
the average donation $1.
The work among the mines was be
gun yesterday and last eveniDg and it
la the hope of the committee that this
one source will bring In more than
gratifying returns. The campaign
among other trades and business will
also prosetuted diligently, beginning
today, and it is believed that tomorrow
will see the quota within reach. The
total amount to be raised in the War
ren district is J1500,or ?4000 for Co
chise county.
The following proclamation, calling
upon the people of Arizona to ob
serve Monday, October 27, as Roose
velt" Day, was issued yesterday:
In listing great Americans, the
nation and the world have given high
place to the name of Theodore Roose
velt. The purity of his life, his de
votion to the land of his birth, the j
high ideals he followed, as well as
advocated, and the services, both
civil and military, which he whole
heartedly rendered to his fellow
men, have all been considered in ac
cording to him the rightful title:
"Theodore ' Roosevelt, American."
As long as the State of Arizona
shall have existence the memory of
theodore Roosevelt will endure in
the hearts of the people, for here
especially he will be rememberd
through that gratest of all reclama
tion works, the Roosevelt Project,
which created an empire from the
desert, and was possible only be
cause of his active influence at a
critical time. , This rugged monu
ment, no more statue or work of art
in bronze or marble, is typical of the
man whose name it bears; a fountain
of good to the people, a direct bene
factor to thousands of homes. It is
such a monument as he would have
wished and within a state made
doubly dear to him as the home of
many . of that gallant regiment that
followed him on Cuban battlefields.
The nation at large ha3 now under
taken to honor the memory of the
hero who has passed. The Roose
velt Memorial association has teen
formed, open to the membership of
all patriotic Americans, to secure for
posterity the Roosevelt home at
Oyster Pay, and make It a shrine of
Americanism as Mount Vernon has
been since the time of George Wash
ington, the Mecca of countless
patriotic pilgrims, and to erect at
the nation's capital, a memorial of
lasting sort and of public utility.
In this memorial Arizona must
have no small part, and in every
community it is hoped that the as
sociation membership campaign will
be actively conducted from October
20th to 27th, with especial participa
tion by the schools and churches. It
is considered particularly fitting that
the last day of the campaign should
be set aside for public observance.
NOW, THEREFORE, I Thomas E.
Campbell, Governor of Arizona, by
virtue of the authority vested in me
by law, do hereby set aside Monday,
October 27, 1919, as Roosevelt Day,
an ddo request and urge that On that
day every effort be put forth to in
sure the success of the Memorial
campaign, and that on the evening
of such day there will be held public
assemblies at which the special sub
ject be "The Americanism of Theo
dore Roosevelt."
IX WITNESS WHEREOF, I have
hereunto set my hand and caused the
Great Seal of the State of Arizona
to be affixed.
Done at Phoenix, the Capital, this
18th day of October, 1919.
THOMAS E. CAMPBELL,
Governor.
Where the money will go that is
subscribed during the Roosevelt me
morial campaign has been more defi
nitely staled in a resolution of the
national committee, as announced
from New York today.. The resolu
tion provides that the money be put
into three objects. The first is the
improvement of land at Oyster Bay
for a Roosevelt Memorial park, the
second to erect a monument at
monument at Washington, and the
third to establish a Roosevelt society
or foundation to carry on Colonel
Roosevelt's spirit of Americanism
and keep alive the uncompromising
patriotism of which he was so es
sentially the exponent.
In carrying out this work much
will depend upon the amount re
ceived during the present campaign,
and in consequence over-subscription
b ystat es and counties will lend to
the achievement of greater things by
the Roosevelt Memorial association,
of which every subscriber automati
cally becomes a member. It is de
sired that every patriot become an
integral part of the association.
Elihu Root of the national com
mittee, in announcing tne plans for
the monument to be erected In
Washington, said: "To erect a
monumental memoiial in Washing
ton which will rank with the Wash
ington monument and the Lincoln
memorial. The" form this memorial
will take cannot be determined; this
niust rest largely with the architects
and sculptors, who will be called
upon to design (he most appropriate
and dignified monument that can be
built, and with the National Fine
Arts commission, that under the law
must approve the design and de
termine the site."
Out of the third object, the Roose
velt society or foundation, will grow
a great institution of an educational
and patriotic nature. The plans for
this object are still tentative and
will depend largely upon the amount
realized from the present campaign.

At Death's Door
' l was talking with my neighbor.
Mr. Webb, the ether day regarding the
great trouble his Siomach had given
him. He said he suffered 7 or 8 years
and had been almost at death's door
a number of times from acute indiges
tion and bloating of gas, which seem
ed to shut off his heart action. He
said he wouldn't have lived much
longer if he hadn't taken Mayr's Won
derful Remedy when he did, which
made a well man of him. It is a
simple, harmless preparation that re
movest he catarrhal mucus from the
intestinal tract and allays the inflam
mation which causes practically all
stomach, liver and intestinal ailments,
including appendicitis. One dose will
convince or money refunded.

have had a sad touch, others really
funny, ahd some have been filled
with impossible questions. They
have interested me; but more than
that, they hnve set me to thinking,
to wondering why it is that so few
persons have a true understanding
of the function of a singing teacher
and to be able to recognize him when
found.
This last matter Is the outcome of
the voice Itself, of Its being some
thing no one can spread out as the
pianist or violinist can the arms and
hands to look at. The voice can
not conveniently be shown the pu
pil, which alone makes it possible
for Impostors posing as teachers to
get money under false pretenses.
I myself was fortunate. Almost
at the outset I fell into competent
teaching hands. Most pupils, how
ever, have the opposite experience.
If I were to have It all to do over
again I still think I would be able
to tell whether a teacher was the
right one for me. For when my
sister came home, after each lesson,
and told me about her maestro (who
was soon after mine also) I could
see his Ideas were based upon what
appeared to be common sense as
has since been proved.
"He tells .me," -said Carmella after
. her first lesson, "that I am not a
soprano at all, but a mezzo."
I think that did more than any
thing else could have done at the
time to give me confidence in him.
I had always felt my sister was
straining her top voice; the highest
notes always sounded beyond her
physical comfort to sing.
After a few lessons Carmella
quickly saw for herself that the
teacher was right. She became en
thusiastic, and insisted I should go
to him. for his verdict.
My natural skepticism was, I ad
mit, somewhat overcome; and di
rectly I went to this teacher.
Almost imriediately he gave m
confidence, the same sort I had got
ten in a less direct way when Car
mella told me what he had said
about her voice being a mezzo. It
was his utter frankness and sim
plicity; hi3 extreme care and unwill
ingness to commit himself Instantly
as to what I could or could not do.
Had he praised me extravagantly
I should have had my suspicions.
The fact that he did not though
he afterwards told me he would have
done so had he not seen that this
would have been distasteful won
my good will. He was thorough in
testing what vocal resources I had,
instating that I repeat one song sev
eral times. He even had me do a
certain exercise four or five times.
After nearly half" an hour of test
ing, and putting to' me numerous
questions concerning how it felt
when I sang given tones, the study
I had done, and other specific mat
ters which he felt he must know, he
leaned back in his chair.
"You are. not a meszo-soprano,"
he declared. My heafrt beat wildly.
What was I, if not-amezzo? "You
are a genuine dramtftifc soprano. And
I think you have a future."
"Are you sure?"; I asked. It
seemed incredible' (.hat I should
have th type of voice I had most
admired in women. : "Can I sing
high enough?"
He smiled. "It is the quality of
the voice that determines its classi
fication," he replied, "not the range.
That comes next. But you have the
top notes. The fact that you have
not sung them doesn't imply they
are not there. You., will see, after
a few lessons."
I did see. After' half a dozen vis
Its to his studio my upper notes
which had never been easy for me,
began to come with a sense of free
dom; as though they actually be
longed In my voice, f Almost before
I was aware of what was happening
I was singing up to B natural and
high C. And the whole voice
seemed to have been lifted up.
I was delighted,-for I felt certain
now that I had found a teacher who
understood one of the most difficult
professions we have.

BY REVIEW
STOCKS AND BONDS
NEW YORK, Oct. 21 Dealing on
the stock exchange today differed in
no important particular from recent
sessions, the market again concentrat
ing to an extroardirary degre in spec
ulative issues.
Traders for the long account had an
added incentive in the easier money
market so far this month. Call loans
opened at 6 per cent, large amounts
being supplied at that figure, which
ruled throughout the day.
Steels were at substantially higher
levels. ,s .
Rails remained in the background,
but shippings retained some of their
recent prominence.
All the movements were eclipsed by
the further advance of motors and oils.
General Motors again led at an ex
treme gain of 12?i poins to 340, a new
high, half ' o which, was forfeited.
Mexican Petroleum also established a
new maximum at 2584 and Royal
Dutch and Texas company bounded
forward at the end, the latter rising
11 points to its best record at 299.
Some of the motors, notably Pierce
Arrow and Studebaker developed
marked weakness after early strength,
closing at losses of 1 to 4 points sub
sidiaries alos reacting. Sales amounted
to 1,725000 shares.
Bonds were irregular, including Lib
erty and foreign issues. United King
dom reacting, while Paris 6's strength
ened. Total sales, par value, aggre
gated $14,200,000. Old United States
bonds were unchanged on calL
THE CORN MARKET
CHICAGO, Oct. 21. Secere breaks
in the value of hogs more than out
weighed all other factors in the corn
market today. The result was heavy
close. 1U to 2c net lower, with De
cember $1.23?i to $1.23 and May
$1.21 to $1.21. Oats finished 4c
to c of? and provisions unchang
ed to 90c down.
Notwithstanding that corn opened
sharply higher, sentiment quickly re
versed itself. Theupturn at the start
was due entirely to announcement
that on October 25 the railroad admin
istration would restore the individual
permit systems for the fovement of
grain. ' Through this chaneg of of
methods, the arrivals of corn at prl
marq markets was expected by many
traders to be much curtailed. Knowl
edge, however, that under the weight
of excessive supplies the hog market
was undergoing a big tumble took the
lead as soon as the dominating influ
ence in regard to corn, especially after
word came that hog prices in some
cases had dropped $1 a hundredweight
within 24 hours and that fully 16,000
hogs here would be left ove rtonight
unsold. There were also reports that
owing to a packing house strike at In
diapalolis, hogs at Indiana points were
being offered at unusually low figures.
Oats weakened with corn.
Provisions reflected the collapse of
the hog market.

KEPT HER AWAKE
The Terrible Pains in Back and
Sides. Cardui Gave Relief.
Marksville, La. Mrs. Alice Johnson,
of this place, writes: "For one year I
suffered with an awful misery in my back
tnd sides. My left side was hurting me
all the time. The misery was something
awful
I could not do anything, not even sleep
at night It kept me awake most of the
night ... I took different medicines, but
nothing did me any good or relieved me
until I took Cardui . . .
, I was not able to do any of my work
for one year and I got worse all the time,
was confined to my bed off and on. I got
10 bad with my back that when I stooped
down I was not able to straighten up
Igain . . . I decided I would try Cardui
; . . By time I had taken the entire bottle
I was feeling pretty good and could
Itraighten up and my pains were nearly
111 gone.
. I shall always praise Cardui. 1 con
tinued taking it until I was strong and
well." If you suffer from pains due to
female complaints, Cardui may be just
what you need. Thousands of women
who once suffered in this way now praise
Cardui for their present good health.

TRAIL WILL BE
GREAT HIGHWAY
Tl.o OJ Sjianish Trail from Florida
lo California which passes through
llii-lce is givins evidence of becom
ing a great highway. Development
woik is proceeding on numerous
link.? in the system, concrete, brick
mid other paved roads are building,
tig bridges are Hearing the construc
tion stage, and many bad spots are
being smoothed out.
Bisbee is vitally interested in this
highway, for the vogue of the "over
hind traveler is growing and the
highway that connects Florida, Mo
bile, New Orleans, San Anionio, El
I'aso, San Diego and Los Angeles
will bring many pleasant visitors to
this community.
Over $100,000,000 ' in bonds have
been voted, or are in process of vot
ing, considerable portions of which
i.re for highway work on this trail.
At San Antonio November 14th,
loth, the general annual convention
will be hold of interested workers
and members along the 2,900 miles
of h.'t'ivvay. These conventions ars
Kot restricted to members, but are
oyon to everyone interested in seeing
the trail developed. A delegation
1': '. m here means one more impulse
toward bringing this section to the
front. i
The central offices of the Old
Spanish trail association are at SanJ
Antonio, and in every county where
live lcr.de rs can bo found, members
iue brng enlisted and a county club
is heirs formed. All the por of
centralized effort today is being put
behind the Old Spanish highway to
build it up and to beautify it.
A.-i a tourist highway It is without
a peer. It is lined with historical
-associations from end to end. As
the grer.t military highvay so much
discussed, it embraces San Diego,
the military and naval headquarters
of California; San Antonio, the
greatest military center in the United
States and the gateway to Mexico;
New Orleans, the central southern
military nutlet; and Pensacola, the
southern naval base.
Historically it reaches back 400
yc:rs to the fasefnating exploits of
the Spanish cavalier and the heroic
ministrations of the Franciscan
Friars and this history, like the
Trail, spans the continent. St. Au
gustine, in Florida, is the oldest city
in the United States. Santa Fe, in
New Mexico, is next. San Diego, in
California, marks the beginning of
California and of the white conquest
of the Pacific coast. Southern Cali
fornia, Arizona, New Mexico and
Texas are Old Mission centers, and
many of these wonderful mission
buildinps siilj stand along the Trail,
la Louisiana it the romantic coun
try of Evangeline and New Orleans,
the "Paris of America." Then the
Mississippi tiulf coast and old Mo
bile, Tensacola and Tallahassee, the
Suwanco river, Jacksonville, St.- Au
gustine arid Tampa.
It is the Trail for the traveler and
cne that will mellow his heart every
cay lie travels it.
