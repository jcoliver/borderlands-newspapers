(By Review Leased Wire)
CHICAGO. Jan. 12. Railroads en
tering Chicaeo abandoned all attempts
to cperste trains today. Tie lashing,
telow zero wind made it impossible
for wcrkmen to make any headway in
their efforts to clesr the switch in
tersecticcs of snow. Scores or pas
render trains were reported stalled
in drifts throughout the central west.
AUerrpts to move freight were
abandoned early. Passe&ier trains
were kept runnin? for a time as they
coald be moved wi;h two engines on
the front and one in the rear. Scow
plows were ordered out with three
engines behind them, but their work
ufs futile. TLe wind piled the dri'ts
behind them as fast as they couid
'push is from the tracks head.
As conditions became worst toward
nightfall, the railways abandoned all
attempts even to keep their lines
clear and concentrated their efforts
on the relief of passengers marooned
on trains along ail lines from twenty
five to 10 miles from the city.
No distress was r.-pcrted monj

At night the u?uai crowds of trA

of Worst Cold Spell Since
Memorable Season Years
Ago.
WASHINGTON. Jan. 12. The cold
est weather experienced in the United
Slates since li99 extended from the
Ricky Mountains to the Atlantic coast
and from the lakes to the E'llf. Zero
temperatures were registered almost
as far south as Btrniin-h:.r.'. Aia .
whilein North Dakota the tti?-nom.;ter
went to tLirty-two degrees I elow zero
and it was only twelve decrees higher
in many parts of the middle lesL
Thecold wave was accciaii'iei by
a high wind in many sections, while ia
the west there was heavy suow. which
blocked laiiroad traffic in several
states on both sides of the Missss-iipi
river. Inability of the railroads to de
liver shipments of coal urgently need
ed in many sections, particularly in
Ohio alid Michigan, as expected to
greatly increase the suffering caused
by the storm.
The snow storm was expelled to
pass tonisht, the weather bureau re
ported. New York and New England tonight
had not felt the full severity of the
cold wave, reports to the wsatlicr bu
reau showed, but temperatur there
were falling rapidly and much co.aor
weather was forecast for tomorrow.
In the south the wrold extended far
into Florida and the cold alon; the
gulf coa was severe, the thermomet
er registering eighteen below freezing
at Mobile and twenty-one below at
New Orleans.
MERCURY RISING
KANSAS CITY. Jan. 12. With the
mercury slowly rising Kansas City
andthe southwest early tonight look
hopefully to a modification tomorrow
of the severe weather that has pre
vailed for the la.t forty-eight hours.
Cold weather records of many years
standing were broken in Missouri.
Kansas. Oklahoma and Texas in the
lan two days. Train service virtually
has been discontinued in many parts
of the southwest, and the spectre of a
coal famine is causing great anxiety
in many places. At Topeka coal cars
were attached to passenger trains,
which were still running, to supply
needed fuel for state institutions at
Beloit and Parsons. Kas.
The eighty grade schools here will
be closed all of next week and possibly
longer. Twenty-eight Catholic paro
chial schools also will be closed.
It has been decided to ask all the
churches in the city not to hold ser
vices tomorrow night in order to h elp
conserve the cial supply.

zona and the agricultural committee
of the Arizona Bankers' Association
W illie Brogan. a 1 year-old boy of
Whitewater. Arizona, is the champion
in the com raising contest. On one
acre of land he raised corn which
brought $161.12 :rosi receipts. The
cost of proportion was 123.25. leaving
a net profit of $137.87. A large part
of the corn was sold as roasting, ears
and part for cured corn fodder. This
corn took the first prize at tte Co
chise county fair and at the state fair.
Harry Miller is the winner of tlie
garden contest. On one-twenty-scotid
of an acre of land, this 15-year-old boy
of Lowell raised $120.10 worth of gar
den truck. The cost of production was
only J 16.9. netting the yonng gardner
$103.17 f on the small plot of laud.
The average profit on an acre basis
would be- JJti9.74. He was rw;.'jrd
first prize of $S, at the state fair.
Six bens belonging to Jewel Bell,
age 14 years, of Wilcox, laid 721 es.
The gross returns were $29.1$. Feed
for the hens cost the youthful owner
$13.28 leaving a net profit of $13.9t. A
local prize of a poultry house was
awarded for this record.
Second Ftancese. ageU 17 years, of
Duncan. Arizona, won the grain sor
ghum contest. A total yield of 4.620
pounds of kaffir was raised on one
acre of ground. The gross returns for
the crop amounted to $120.90. while
the cost of production was ouly $1S.60.
netting the young farmer the hand
some sum of $102 30. This ia'iir was
awarded second prize at the state fair.
In 1916 this boy won t state cham
pionship in the corn raising rontest.
Raymond Own. a 13-year-old boy of
Yuma, is the champion in the pig rais
ing contest. The total weight of his
pig at S months was 249 pounds. It
brought the owner $ the cost of
raising it being $23. leaving a net
profit of $2947. This pis took the
first prize at the Yuma county fair.
Edith Morris, a 17-year-old young
lady of Pima, is te champion in the
canning contest. She canned 1.20s
quarts of fruit, brineing a gross value
of $;i.S5. The cost or putting up the
fruit amounted to $132.43. making a
net profit of $3S2.42. Two merit
awards were given this ehibit at the
state fair.
Announcemer of the fixing of 23S
cents as the continued price of copper
by the war Industries board it Is
estimated will reduce Arizona's cop
ier production not less than five miK
lion pounds the month. Accurate fig
ores are difficult to reach because
of the varying conditions of mining in
tr.e different districts.
A good many small shippers who
hare been keeping up production in
the hope that the price of ie metal
would be advanced to at least 26
cents, will be obliged to shut down.1
A few of these have been out putting
coosiderabletonnages of ore and wi3
make a hole in the total production
rer month of arounl l.O.OOO paunds.
They are in different parts of the
stata. The greater part of the total
loss, however, will be sustained by the
large rein mining concerns. These
have gone as far as they can. with ex
ception of a few instances, in their
hieher grade ores on limited develop
ment, in the expectation that they
would be able cn a higher price for
the metal to reach into their lower
grades.
Cut off from this source they must
now divert larger labor efforts to
opening higher grade ores. As this
is a manner of work that cannot be
lushed, that is always attended by an
certainties as to whether the vein will
widen or pinch and as to the amount
of dead work that may be compelled,
and that can be pursued in limited un
derground workings space by only lira-'
ited forces, it will be seen that de
creased output, for a time at least, is '
certain cf resulting.
The Verde district Is probably more '
fortunate In hieh grade ore reserves
than other districts of the state, but;
i'l not wholly estxpe the pinch, al ;
though both Verde Exter-sicn and Tn-!
ited Yerde have big high grade bo-
Ji-s it reserve. Among the smaller
pro-Jueers of Yavapai county and
trihrtary mineral country, the situa-1
tionis the reverse. This class of
producers will prcbably be harder hit
in Ibis part of the state than anv i
where els.
The general, effect upon labor wi.lj
be to Increase tte surplus already ex-,
tant in most mining districts in the -state.
The higher the grade of ore
s iaed the less the number of men
ter.uited on mining, while by reason!
of space limitations the smaller the
number that can be employed cn ie-'.
velopnient. Wit!) less production of
copper and consequently less earnings..

A. G. McGregor will leave shortly
for Peru and Chile, in which countries
he will give -consideration to smelter
construction projects now underway
and contemplated. e will be absent
from his Warren ofiices a couple of

Mr. McGregor recently returned to
the district from New-York, where he
was with reference to Arizona smelt

way. It is understood that while in
New York his interest in the South
American projects was obtained and
thauhe visit be is about to make is an
3utcome.
The embargo the Cnited States ha
plaqed npon steel is understood to
have brought moot South- American
construction work to a standstill. At
the present time those interested in !
the establishment of new copper ore
reduction plants, of which there are
several cf large importance either un
derway or planned in the South Am-erir-an
countries, are at a standstill
with tbeir enterprises, but are avail

.-uch other advance plans as they can.

Sunday Morning Sermon j
. ... j -- . .
"And wen it was day the Jews banded them
selves together and bound themselves nder a
curse, saying they would neither eat nor drink
till they had slain Pari." Acts 2312.
And so far as the records show these same Jew have
neither eaten nor drunk from that dsy to this, a matter
of some twenty centuries, for Paul worked and preached
many years after that oath was taken, and he died from
Roman, not Jewish hands. Paul's ministry was fraught
with more peril and hardship than that of any other
preacher this world has known, unless It was Peter.
Paul's fire and eloquence and fearlessness marked him
for especial persecution at the hands of all pagans, and
his high Jewish birth marked him for the especial venge
aoce of the Jews. He spent most of the years of his
ministry either in prison or in exile or in hiding or In
danger of a cruel death. Bat tis fiery scul only burned
the brighter and his dauntless heart beat the stronger
for all the efforts of the enemies of his faith and his
stewardship.
How many, many times must this high born Jewish
patrician and his humble, earnest, impetuous, lovable
brother apostle, Peter, have thought that their efforts
wire both useless upon earth and unappreciated In
Heaven. They trudged the rough and sandy highways
with weary and wounded feet: they slept under the
stars and hid in squalid tuts of the cities; they fled in
the night time and were chained to the!r prison bench ;
they never looked upward towards Heaven but they
saw the sword of the Reman or the scourge of the Jew
suspended between them and the skies. -
They preached in stables and deserted cemeteries
and mountain gorges and upon the sands of the sea.
Their audiences were composed in the main of the poor
and the ignorant. and the unkempt and the unfortunate.
Their hosts were stricken with poverty and broken by
tort and their friends were either fugitives from the law
or slaves of foreign and domestic tyrants. Their enemies
sat in the high places and wore velvet and drank from
golden cups.
How often, oh. how c'ten. must Peter and Paul have
wondered at the distance to the skies and the coldness
of the stars and the futility of their steadfastness to a
righteous cause.
Did they weep and pray? Did they pause and
ponder? Did they doubt and despair? If they did. who
can blame them?
But they kept on with their work. They were true
to their faith. They held to the right as they had been
given signs for their eyes to see it and conscience for
their hearts to know it. The Jews handed together and
took an oath to neither eat nor drink till they had slain
the apostle PauL And these Jews are fasting still in
death and darkness. But Paul lives on. Paul bearded
Nero on his throne and braved death in the arena before
his wasted and wounded form became still forever more.
Was his work appreciated upon earth? His only
earthly home was either a prison or a highway or a cross
in the days of his ministry. But today in every Christian
land there is a St. Paul's cathedral whose spires glitter
in the sunlight above all the buildings 'round about. His
converts and followers were peasants and paupers then,
they are princes and the high of the earth today.
The Jews were handed to slay htm. but be was saved
from their wrath time and time again until his work was 1
done. Every hour of his steadfast greatness in humble
work ind neglected suffering was appreciated as no
work has ever been appreciated before or since on
earth or in Heaven.
Take heart, oh. ye that plod on in humble places do
ing Fimple work an, keeping faith in both small ami great
things, for in the end sll the work ye do shall he render
ed In your favor and the least and the most of your fai'h
shall be multiplied for you by both men and angels.
Every right ye do w;ll rome back some time like a
lighted lamp in the shadows, and every wrong ye do will
return again after many days with a scorpion's sting
Steadfastness and rtaunrhne8 and dependability.
thee are never in vain The children's children of the j
men who persecuted and slew Paul worshiped his
memory and bund shrines to hallow hisiame. The men
who scoff your humble efforts today will pray tomorrow.
A handful of poor pec pie gathered at midnight in a
deserted cemetery beyond Rome to hear a broken, thin
faced man with burning eyes preach a simple creed of
goodness and gentleness in a world of sin and cruelty
did not know that they were the builders of a church
that would girdle the globe with thousands of magnifi
cent temples and millions of worshipers of high and low
degree.
That is it; we never know. Our vision is so dim. our
hand so weak, our place so small, our ears so dull, our
heart so faint, our results so vague, our faith so small.
that we do not know. But the breath from a frail chest
may well start a tempest, and a word from true lips may
well level the walls of a great city. If vju do the right
thing as you know it and see it. and if you keep the faith,
great or small, you shall prevail in the end. and those
who do not do so shall walk in misery at the end, no mat
ter what the beginning may be. This has always been
true of all men and things since Adam trembled before
the angel in the garden, and always will be, until Peter
ends his vigil before the gates of Heaven.

AS MAN TO MAN
That woman's suffrage should carry in the lower
house of congress after the record made in that body
the past session by Jeanette Rankin, the first and only
woman member, is remarkable. No act or vote or pub
lie word of this woman since taking her seat has been
aught but that dictated by heedless folly or an ignorance
of real causes and effects that cannot learn. Her las:
official act has been to introduce a resolution for the
V. S. A. to recognize the independence of Ireland. This
is playing right into the hand of Germany, our country's
enemy, and a direct insult and offense to England, onr
ally In war. This column bows to no man or woman in
the world in a sincere desire to see Ireland happy and
prosperous with home rule that is real and true. But
with Ireland's worst enemies egging her on to acts of
folly, and with her own factional differences unseitlec
and England in the midst of a perilous war for her na
tional life. Is no time to bring up such a question a
this. For a member of congress to do so is as though c
physician should spread the germs of pestilence in
home where sickness already dwells. Thousands of
brave Irishmen are fighting In France for England and
making a record that will right Ireland's wrongs forever
in spite of an that German agents and Ireland's foolish
friends can do to prevent it-
Henry George's old expression. "Cive us men!" would
fit well with conditions of today. The demand is for men.
Men w ho can see ahead and plan and speedily carry out
their plans. From the highest places of the war and
navy departments of the government down to the last
foreman cf a shipyard or master of railroad terminals or
boss of a freight depot or box car gang, we need men
The man with a mind to conceive .the short cut or the
greatest degree of efficiency and with the courage and
force to carry these things out or through Is worth a dor
en men in a pinch right now. The foreman, boss, inspector,
captain, secretary, chief clerk, sub manager, assistant
all these are vital cogs in the great war machine. The
fate of the war rests upon the allies finding and brineing
to the front men fit for great tasks that are arising upon
every hand. If the big fellows falter or fail, it is the
little fellows, the subalterns and assistants that must
make up the lack or the loss. Just because your natce
or your task is unsung and unrewarded is no reason or
excuse why you should shirk or shrink or seek shelter
from the great work that is calling America's sons.
"The trouble with so many of the English boys in
this district Is, they are in love, disgustedly remarked
Sergeant Blinman. hero of the Somme and British re
cruiting officer in this section of Arizona. Asked to be
more specific, he went on to say: "They have sweet
hearts, you know, and say they do not want to leave them
to go to war. The women in this district must be vastly
different from the women of Canada, and England, for
in those countries the man who declines to enlist ran
scarcely get a woman to look at him or speak to him.
much less be his lady love," And what the sergeant
says is as full of wisdom as was one of Solomon's de
crees of old. The women, after all. and before all things,
are responsible for men's goodness and happiness ar.d
bravery and patriotism and steadfastness in this world
The woman who loves or weds a slacker. in war loves
or weds a slacker in peace as a general rule, although, of
course, there are few or many exceptions to all rules, as
the case may be.
The little British colony of Newfoundland with a
population of about two hundred thousand souls has re
s ponded so well to the call of the great mother across
the sea, and fought so bravely on many 'fields of this war
ftiat she has been given the title "Dominion of New
fi midland." This little colony has given a battalion or
more than a thousand infantrymen to fight the Hun and
has sent five thousand more men to the front to keep
this battalion intact. In the Somme campaign the New
foundland troops went in a thousand strong anil only
ninety-five effectives were left. Hats off to the new lit
tle Dominion off the fog hanks of Canada.

SPOILED BY SUNSHINE
AND THEN BUFFETED
BY THE STORM
All through the fall and far into the
w inter this newspaper man basked In
the sunshine and was petted by the
halm "of the zephyrs and spoiled by
the scent of flowers. Surely this is
the life, he thought, and. like a hot
house plant or a shorn lamb, he
ambled along the path of the seasons.
And then storm clouds gathered high
above the mountains and a cold wind
came out of the north tike a wolf on
the fold, and the snowflakes filled the
air and covered the red sand and dust
of the dry earth like a blanket.
And the newspaper man shivered in
the blast. Yea, he was Tery cold. His
hide was tender and his clothes were
thin and old. The wind cut him like
a knife and he exclaimed tn a loud
voice against the frost king and the
tempest.
But it Is always so m life. After
the sunshine rometh the storm; toil
always follows the season f rest,
and sorrow follows joy like the night
shadows follow the daylight. We need
the storms to test us and make us
strong. Too much sunshine and too
much play and too much gladness
spoil us sadly. -The smile that is
worth, all the praise of earth U the
smile that can shine through tears."
And so the newspaper man folds his
; mantle closely about him and hold
his bands to his frost-bitten ears and
stamps his chillblained and spavined
feet and grins a feeble grin of com
mend! ion for the cold weather and
the sorrows that that the high gods
send to man here below.

Whistler was short of funds and plan-J
nei to take only enough for his "im

out by Wornal'.'s statement that when
the roan entered the bank he said be
was "short of money and hated to

firm their theory Is that the body of
Wiaters was found lying on top of a
larse number of back notes w hich bad
been scattered over the floor in front
of the safe.
The suicide of Captain Whistler was
discovered by brother officers who
heard the two shots and runted to the
rocta. They found him lying on the
floor, the tifle nearby.
Arrangements for the funerals of
the four victims of the tragedy had
not been made tonight.

At Montevideo i
We left Rio the th of July, and
after four days at sea arrived at
Montevideo. I ruguay. a very pretty
citr. but nothing compared with Rio
Here again I witnessed a wonderful
sight and one I will never forget.
Thousands of people came out about
10 miles in small boats to meet ns.
The boats were
all riMorated with
' flags and they kept their whistles
blowing continuously. This, adde-i to
1 th nrinr of the neoDle'a hats and
j their shouts, sure let us know how
we would be received there. And
nuuiu
j when we entered the harbor we again
round out how we would be received.
' for they had a large electric sign of
' welcome on one of the piers. I went)
ashore the nrst day we were there,
and it did not take me long to be eon-
vmced that we were welcome mere.
Every one we met on the street had
a sm;le for us. especially the girls.
lt seems the first word of English
they learned was "Good-by," so as
we walked down the street we had
good bys cast at us from all sides am?
pretty Spanish girls smiling at as
from all sides. It was a wonderful
sensation. I visited the homes of
two families while I was In Monte
video and I had a fine time. The one.
I met a fellow on the street and as I
can speak a little Spanish, he took
a liking to me and invited me to his
home. The other, there were seven
out of the band invited as an orches
tra to a house party, and at this visit
we danced all afternoon and had a
big banquet at 7:30.
I visited Swift's packing plant also
while in Montevideo, and that also
was quite an experience.
To Buenos Aire
We stayed in Montevideo about two
weeks, and we then went upon the
Plata river to Buenos Aires, the New
York of South America. Here we'
were again met by thousands of peo
ple in small boats. We tied up to the
dock of Buenos Aires, so we had it
Terr convenient as far as liberty a as
concerned, as we just had to step over
the gangway to get ashore. We w ere
treated fine here also, as all the thea
tres and street cars were free to ns.
The people did not recognize us as
much as they did in Montevideo, but
outside of that everything was fine.
I went to several shows especially
gottea up for us that took us about
the business district and to the -ira
porta nt buildings and monumeuts;

"Cav's Letters From Front to -His
Son Should Be Read by Everyone
SIX
(Frcnk W. Cavanaugh, t;e old
Dartmouth football coach and now
a lieutenant in the American
heavy artillery in France, wrote
a letter to his small son David at
Christmas time of such rare sim
plicity and feeling tnat after ap
pealing in the Worcester. Mass.,
Post it has been several times re
printed by request. Though writ
ten fcr the understanding! of a six-year-old
bey, the letter will be
read with emotion by many grown
ups.) "IV-ar Davie Eoy: Your pood mother
rrite me that yen hare a chum, and
she says he's a fine hoy who lives next
door. Isnt that finer I wish I had a
chum. Yon and join mother used to
be my chum and sometimes Joe and
"Billy, and even dear little Rose Marie
and Phil.' too. when he was home:
but now all that i changed and I
have no thorn inall the world. I think
i:s rather sad sometimes, don't yon.
but I have your pk-ture. which I take
down and talk to when I am lonesome.
"I am happy fo know you like your
rew school and home, and I'm sure
yoall only play with clesn boys who
dont do anythiE; very bad and who
also like to go to school. Didn't we
use to haTe great times together,
and wasnt it fun when you'd come
up to the car to meet me? Then
when yon saw me getting off do you
remember how you'd hide behind a
tree and run cp behind me and scare
me after I had passed? And do you
remember how sometimes you and I
would race and you were getting so
you could run pretty fast, for you
were gettine to be a big boy?
"And then we'd all go down to see
the cirrus and the parade and bold
hands so we wouldn't get separated
or lost. And then Christmas. Oh.
wasn't that a wonderful day! Early
in the morning how we would all
rush downstairs to see your presents.
And. then. poor, tired mother would
work and work to give ail you boys
and girls a Christmas dinner tur
key, cranberry sauce and dressing
and plum pudding, and randy and
nuts and everything. Oh. Dave, did

mother as you. I wonder. And now
you are soon to hare another Christ
mas and old Car wont be home.
Bnt I want you to have the best time
you erer bad on that day. so that I
may be happy over here thinking of
you all. I wish I knew some little
bofs and girls over here so that I
might talk to them and bold their
hands and I would rail them my
boy's and girl'names and pretend
that I was home.
"The other night I had a lovely
dream, and I was so disappointed
when I awoke. I dreamed I was sit
ting in our kitchen with mother and
David and all the children, and a
chair which was tilted back against
the wall slipped and I fell gently and
without hurting me to the floor. And
then mother and you and all the chil
dren laughed and laughed, just like
good, naughty folks. And you came
over and took my hand in yours and
lifted me up easily. Isn't that funny.
Dare? Think of any boy lifting a
big. fat father like me from the floor
with one band. Then we laughed
some more, and suddenly 1 remem
bere it was after 9 o'clock. I said.
Vhy. children, what are yon doing
out of bed at this hour of the night T
And you said. Vhy. it isn't very
often our father goes away to war.
so we thought we ought to stay up
and say good bv." And then I was so
surprised to learn that I hadnt gone
away to war yet that I suddenly
awoke only to find myself in my
little lonely barracks and the rain
was coming down hard outside and
I was lonesome for my dear family.
"And now. David, old boy, eevry
one is in bed but me. trying to get
lots of strength and health for the
big fights we will soon be tn. so I
must do likewise and end this letter
to you. You must always remember
that your father came into this great
war for the sake of ail little children,
and I know that you will, while I am
gone, take good care of mother and
all the children. " I can see you grow
ing up tall and straight, with shoul
ders back and head up. because that's
what old "Car" wants, and you love
Car, don't you, David boy? Dave,
will you do something real nice for
me? I knew you would. Then kiss
mother and Annie and Billy. Rose
Marie and John for Tav," and send
one to Philip in Maine,
"Excuse me, David, .for writing in

to get.

The local coal committee has ni:t
the following arrangements to pro-i

Through the courtesy of the Copper;

People desiring the roal must ar-
ange fcr socking and hauling the coal
themselves. !
Price of coal 1 lwibe $12.00 per ton j
Single sack. .5 cents.
Cash in full must be pai-i at the
bin.
For the benefit of people wo Utv!:

simple rules are published.
Put oLly a small TKunt of coal'
fai the stove and give strong draft to!
start burning: when the roal cokes or'
runs together, break the mass with a

If a large amount is put in the
stove and not broken up when it I

Probably the most pretentious lec-'
tare tour undertaking that has taken '
place in the state of Arizona is that of i
the Arizona State Bureau of Mines
which will be represented at Bisbee
by S. C. Dickinson, safety engineer of
that organization.' The lectures will s
be held at Bisbee on January -t, t3
and 26.
It is a free entertainment, a free
moving picture show, a tree lecture
and instruction worth while all com
bined into one. The work is a most
important one consisting of bringing
the University of Arizona out to the
people, and applying it in sugar-coated
packages, pat up in form easily taken
and more easily dizested.
First aid to the injured is some
thing everybody should know for t he
time is romine shortly when a certi
ficate of proficiency in rirst aid w ill
be as important as a letter of recom
mendation in securing a new job. And
firstiid is not a thing which one ran
learn by reading books but only by
practice under the eye of an expert.
Dickinson is the first aid and mine
rescue trainer for the state and is
making close studies of the conserva-l
tion of life, cafp welfare, sanitation,
recreation and many other things per
taining to the living of a healthy and
satisfied life are among the things
that will be seen and heard by those
attending tre lectures.
Among the other Arizona State Bu
reau of Mines men that are in the lec
ture field are M. A. Ailen. Mineral
Technologist and George R. Fansett.
Rock Analyst. Practically every min
ing town of the state is being covered
by all three of these men.

Quick action and presence of mind
last night probably saved the life of
officer Joe Hard wick, or that of one of
the two men arrested.
Hardwick approached two Mexicans
who were loitering in the neighbor
hood or the lumber yard on Brewery
Gulch. The officer saw a b ulgy pock
et on one of the men and discovered
that the pocket contained a gun of
some kind. The man refused to throw
up his hands and. meanwhile, the oth
er was attempting to get at something
Inhis inside pocket.
Hardwick decided the argument had
gone far enough and cocked his gun.
At this juncture the Mexican with the
gun acceded to the demand to throw
rp his h ands and then the officer
covered both. One carried a forty-five
Coifs automatic revolver. It was load
ed, had a shell in the barrel and ready
to be fired. The other man had asix
inch stilletto in his pocket. Between
the two. a bottle of native wine was
carried.
Both men were locked in the city

for the latter property, although the

Elsie Ferguson
Is Eagle's Star
The matter of supplying a star with
with a vehicle that she personally
feels is particularly adapted to her
capabilities is by no means the most
simple procedure in the activities of
the producer. At the Atrcraft studio
recently. Elsie Ferguson, the famous
stage beauty, who makes her screen
debut in "Barbary Sheep" at the Eagle
theatre today, expressed great delight
over the selection of this story as her
first motion picture play.
" 'Barbary Sheep. " said the popular
stage star. "is. I feel, an ideal play for
me. The part of Lady Wyrerne. the,
English noblewoman, fits me perfect
ly, and in reading Robert Hichen's
description of the young lady I almost
thought be was painting my own pic
tare, even to the color of my hair. I
hope I bare done the part full justice
and that the public will enjoy seeing
this characterization to as great ex
tent as I did in portraying it."
for peace because the entente powers
had not agreed to participate in the
parleys, the Russians, Trotxky said,
adhered to the principles of a demo
cratic peace as they had already set
tehm forth.
After the Russin position had been
thus voiced, the conferences apparent
ly got down quickly to business. They
left the. question of separate represen
tation for the Ukraine in the confer
ence for discussion' at a plenary ses
sion after the delegates of the cen
tral powers had talked it over among .
themselves. They then arranged for
the German. Aostro-Hungartan and
Russian detentions to get together
for private discussions. These three
sets of delegates speedily organized
questions and went into session for
this purpose. I
The Ukrainian spokesman at the '
conference gave notice that any peace '
settlement that might be reached
would be binding upon the Ukraine
only if accepted by it, and declared
the same principle applted to "the
other Russian republics." '
Mid-winter quiet on the part of the ,
infantry continues to prevail on the
various battle fornts. The artillery
has been active In some sectors nota
bly north of eVrdun. where the firing '
was r ported heavy between Beau
mont and Bezonvaux. The British
carried out a raid east of Loos and
captured a few prisoners.

This is the statement of DR. L. P. MORGAN, consulting Engineer and General
Manager for the International Syndicate of Mines and Smelters. Mr. L. P. Morgan
was formerly Geological Surveyor for the Mexican and Bolivian Governments and
has just completed an examination of the CHINO VALLEY OIL FIELD. The
picture reproduced in this announcement shows Mr. Morgan on the property of the
ARIZONA OIL & REFINING COMPANY. Mr. Morgan U right at the derrick
which has just been completed, and is making an examination of the Company's
equipment Mr. Morgan studied geology since he was fourteen years of age, in
South America, Africa, India. Australia. China and Russia. He is considered one
of the best versed oil experts in the country, having visited the Oklahoma Oil Fields,
the Tampico, Mexico, fields, the oil fields of Vera Cruz, the Wyoming fieldsnd
the larger oil fields of California. In a signed statement to the General Securities In
vestment Corporation. Mr. Morgan tells of the formation of the CHINO VALLEY
OIL FIELDS being similar to the oil fields of California. To use his own words:
"While inspecting the CHINO VALLEY OIL FIELD I thought I was on a Califor
nia oil field in its virgin state." He signed the following statement:
"Phoenix, Arizona. Jan. 5. 1918
"General Securities Investment Corporation.
"Phoenix, Arizona.
"Gentlemen:
"After visiting the Chino Valley field, and after making a careful investigation
of that country. 1 make this emphatic statement: THERE IS OIL IN PAYING
QUANTITIES IN CHINO VALLEY. Curiosity led me to the Chino Valley oil fields.
I heard considerable about the valley that there were indications of oil. and I de
cided to see for myself.
"My visit resulted in the making of a geological survey of the entire formation of
the valley and I find that all condition? exist according to geology whereby oil in
paying quantities should be produced.
"I made a careful investigation as to the different formations so as to ascertain
what depth will have to be drilled t6 find the oil and I find frorr careful observation
and examination of the formations that at the location where the Arizona Oil Re
fining Company's derrick is now standing that they will strike oil at about a depth
of 2.300 feet.
"Respectfully,
(Signed) "L. P. MORGAN."
Drilling io Start THIS WEEK on the Property
This means an important announcement soon to be made. This means that tre
real active development in search of the oil will start.
At the present time five geologists have reported on CHINO VALLEY OIL
FIELDS. Surely the five cannot all be mistaken.

IMPORTANT ANNOUNCEMENT
Owing to the great demand for the 5c shares on the cash basis and owing to the
limited amount of the allotment at this price, we wish to announce that we will ac
cept no more orders on the actual development basis or on the installment basis cov
ing a period of four months. It is with regret that we make this announcement
without advance notice, but necessity compels it. When the shares are advanced to

amount will be sold on the monthly payment plan, but owing to the limited amount
left of the 5c stock and because the people are willing to pay 5c Cash for the stock
we are obliged to withdraw without notice all installment propositions on the 5c
stock. f

TOMBSTONE PEOPLE
ARE INDIGNANT OVER
LATE APPOINTMENT
Residents of the County Seek
the Removal of Captain
Henderson From Position
of Disbursing Officer.
Crp:ain George P. Henderson of
Tcmbstone has been named as disburs
irg officer in connection with the se
ieelive draft service and assitant to
re adjutant general, succeeding Fred
S. Preen, who recently tendered
resignation to the secretary of war.
Announcement of the appointment,
which cc tries frcm the war department
71 Washington, was male Thursday
and Captain Henderson assumed the
.t'ties of the office on the morning of
Friday. January 11. As the position
is a bonded one. Disbursing officer
3.een has continued to act after ten
!er!cg his resignation and remained
".n charge of the office until relieved
yn Friday morning.
Captain Henderson has been a rest
icat cf Arizona for'the past twenty
years, having been counected with
mining operations in the southern part
s' the state during that tinie. He
-as never held public office in the
state but is thoroughly familiar with
Jf duties of the office to which he
trs just been appointed, having form
e:ly served as assistant to the ad-
tant general of Colorado. Douglas
Dispatch.
The above may be true but it does
.ct meet with the approval of the cit
rens of Tombstone some of whom
ere in the city yesterday, and they
9r?pose to take steps to have the ap
ointment vacated. The appointment
cccrdiag to them was made at th? re
-est of Governor Hunt, They main
tain that Henderson is not a proper
e:son t be appointed at this time
o a position of this kind on account
.1 an alleged pro-German attitude.
There is much talk of a petition be
ng circulated asking for his removal,
n the county seat. It is alleged that
"enderson refused to fly an American
lig on his house or in his yard when
"ked to do so by the patriotic citt
ens of Tombstone and that he told
's children, who were goiae to the
iiibllc school, that they did not have
o salute the American flag when ask
d to do so by the teachers in the ex
vcises with the other children, it

From the novel of the same name by Robert Hichens. That Barbary Sheep is the
greatest work of Msurice Tcurneur is ccmmcnly conceded. Entire villages and gi

rnwaiering or the Denn mine to the l'- level, preparatory to explora-j
ticn at that depth. Is the mosr important pi-ce of new development work at j
present being carried on at advanced sti?e in the state. Resumption of j
development at the Denn was trade in Jjr.e last, since when, with exception j
of a few weeks in which strike troubles prevented work, there has been
nndii nH vimmtis nrosecntion of extensive plans underrround. From '
this work there has thus far been all encouraeinr resclts that were ar.tiil

Ready to Relieve 1600 of Water i
The pumps which will handle Penn water are now beins covered in at ,
U10 feet in the shaft. The water at present stands a l?t;le below the T.M
level. Clearance or water from the 100 level will he under way next wee. .
Pnmps installed are entirely equal to th task. I
Will Determine a Great Deal i
With the 16'"'0 e'eared. there will be rap;d prosecution of work to deter- j
mine whether ore round on the 1100. 12f0. 1300 and 14i0 levels reaches down ;
to the 1C00. If this is found to be true, as is now indicated but which or.ly
artur.I exploration can positively determine. Denn will be in possession of
demonstrated depiU of ore indicating one of the bi.est mines in the district. ;
C. i A. H?y Be Benefited t
Development work on the Decn has demonstrated that it has some very
desirable ore reaching over to the C. A. line. It is nndersto thr.t Calamet
& Arizona is now driving on its Junction 1"00 leTel toward the ore that Penn
has shown to be extant at the line, and it is possible that joint development
ia this area may be or very great nutnal advantage to Denn and C. & A. in
tJ?e extension of ore resources.
Are Awaiting Positive Results j
Denn management has been Tery re'icent in talking or the property. :
Conservative would perhaps better express their attitude. They await finit- ; j
ings on the 16W before committing themselves. The ore they have on the chance from which tJus year is gret- alleged t- have ni:.de nv st:!,er.-.?nts from r.iite. which began last year.

Started With Malvy Trial
Clemencean last month undertook i
to form an administration, with the'
avowed purpose of calling to account j
and of bringing- to trial Louis Malvy.
profligate and gambler he used toj
lose as much as 70.00 francs in a
night at poker for all the treason-!
able and dishonest acts of which he'
had rendered himself guilty while
foriLlng part and parcel of the vari
ous cabinets that had succeeded one
another since the year before the
war. Then it was predicted Joseph
Caillaux would also be brought to
the bar of justice, and that General
Sarrail would be recalled from
Salonica, but without receiving any
other command or promotion.
Orders for Caillanx's trial were
given by General Duball, the military!
fcovernor of Paris.
It tnay be regarded as a singular :
conjunction of events that Sar rail's
return to his native latd should take
place at the very same time as the
repotted soccesf of t Russian Bol
&hev:ki plot -gainst K'ng Ferdinand,
of Rumania. j
The responsibility of the, invasion'
of Rumania and for all the appalling
suffering which it has been called!
upon to endure at the hands of the
Germans, of the Austrians. and espe
cially of the Bulgarians, has been laid
at the door of Sarrail.
The charges against Sarrail bang
together with those brought against
Joseph Cai!!aux. Louis Malvy. Bolo
"Pasha." and all the remainder of
the unsavory crew, same of whom I
are under lock and key. two or three
of whom are dead, under mysterious :

Editor Exposes Scandal .
Indeed, had it not been for the I
igo and Boio scandal, vigorously
and patriotically exploited by Leon
Daudet, we might never have bear!
the true story of the betrayal of Ru
mania, and of the nefarious pro-German,
anti-French, anti-entente, and.
therefore. anti-American, intrigues
ot ex-premier Caillaux and of for-j
mer Minister of the Interior Malvy. j
Malvy was compelled to resign ;
from the cabinet owing to the per-'
sistency of the attacks broueht'
against him day by day in the Paris'
Action Francalse. edited and owned
by Leon Daudet.
Finally. Daudet addressed an of-:
cial letter to the president of the
republic and a copy thereof to Pre
mier Painleve. directly charging Mal
vy with high treason and offering to
rurnisn we. proofs. This letter was
read In the chamber of deputies. Mal
vt resigned.

: tile remarks against the English, the' merits could reach Salonica.
