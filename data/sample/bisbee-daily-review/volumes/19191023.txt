IF ADMINISTRATION REFUSES
TO INCREASE WAGES, SHORTEN
HOURS, HOVE CONDITIONS
Government Faces Virtually Same Labor Crisis Which
Arose During Summer of This Year When President
Wilson Denied Shopmen General Increase
' In Pay on Grounds That Rising Wages
Must Stop Somewhere
WASHINGTON, Oct. 22. Railroad employes are pre
pared for a finish fight with the railroad administration for
increased wages, time and a half for overtime and improved
working conditions before the government surrenders the
road? to private control. Unmistakable notice to this effect
has been served by Timothy Shea of the firemen, appearing
before the board of railway wages and working conditions.
"If our demands for a living wage should not be met
when the time approaches for turning back the railroads to
their private owners," Mr. Shea said in testimony which
became public tonight, "we shall demand as a condition pre
cedent to the change the realization of the fundamental
rights of labor, the living wage, the eight hour day on all
federal controlled roads, time and one-half for overtime and
other principles to which the government pledged itself dur
ing the war, which now have been made a part of the treaty
cf peace and which so far the railroad administration has
never fulfilled."
While Mr. Shea was appealing on' , '. ;
behalf of the firemen only, it has ound that the "vicious circle of
been recognized generally that wage and mntl?eih
increases for any one class of rail-1 com an at

Governor of N. Y. .
Attacks Publisher
ALBANY, N. Y.. Oct. 22 Governor
Smith launched a violent attack
against William Randolph Hearst
and the Hearst newspapers today.
The assault was in the form of a
prepared statement in which the
governor charged the publisher with
deliberately misrepresenting facts in
order to injure the governor, de
clared that the Hearst papers
should be kept out of decent houses,"
and expressed his willingness to test
his case in the good judgment of the
citizens of the state.
' The governor today discussed with
callers a challenge he issued at a
mass meeting of women in New
York Saturday for Mr. Hearst to
meet hi, rain debate and to discuss
each other's public and personal rec
ords. The statement charged that, to
suit his own ourposes and to injure
the governor because he would not
"kneel before" the publisher, an at
tempt had been made to put the im
pression in the public mind that tho
governor has the power to fix the
price of milk. ', ;

In German Opera
NEW YORK, Oct. 22. Rioting
broke out again tonight around the
Lexington theater when, for the sec

company produced German opera
over the protests of veterans of the
world war.
The singers hardly had appeared
on the stage when an occupant of an
upper box, rising, laid down a bar
rage of eggs.
A young man in civilian clothes,
who gave his name as "John Doe,"
was arrested. At the police station
an egg was found in his pocket.
American Legion officials in Great
er New York were besieged all day
by hundreds of persons asking what
could be done to prevent tonight's

wanted to send their .'sons to help
break up the performance, according
to Major George Brokaw Compton,
chairman of the New York organiza

OF
ARE REFUTED
Commission Asserts Allega
tions Against It Were Part
of Packers' Warfare to Sub
vert Justice and Escape
WASHINGTON. Oct. 22. Proof of
the charge of Senator Watson, Re
publican of Indiana, that the federal
trade commission is a hotbed of Bol
shevism, sedition and anarchy was
challenged today by the commission.
In a formal statement, it charged
Senator Watson with having rela
tions with the Chicago meat packers
and declared that his allegations
against the commission's employes
were part of the warfare of the pack
ers against the commission and the
department of justice "with the pur
pose of subverting justice."
The commission alleged that it
was not a "coincidence" that the em
ployes attacked by Senator Watson
were those who had been summoned
lo testify in the case against the
packers which the department of
justice soon is to present to a federal
grand jury in Chicago.
"As the witnesses are about to en
ter the grand jury room," said the!
commission, "there Is every effort to
discredit them."
Declaring that while they had
stood many attacks, the commission
ers said they would be derelict In
their duty if they should let pass un
challenged "the false .outrageous
and despicable assault" made upon
members of their staff "whose only
offense is that they have stood stead
fast in the performance of their, duty,
under constant harassment, resist
ing cajoleries, offers of employment
and attempted seductions."
At the time the commission's
statement was made public, Senator
Watson was informing the senate
that none of the information on
which the charges were based had
been furnished by representatives of
the packers; that all of it had come
from inside the commission itself.
He declared that he was investigat
ing the activities of Socialists in
other departments of the government
and would make known the results to
the public from time to time.

Conferences to Reassemble
Wilson's Letter Does
Not Stir Union Men
Capital Representatives Will
Not Accept Responsibility
of Breaking Up Meeting!
But Will Remain in Session j
WASHINGTON, Oct. 22. Labor
withdrew from the national indus
trial conference tonight, after its
final effort to obtain adoption of a
collective bargaining resolution had
been defeated by a vole of a majority
of the capital group.
Although the representatives of
both the public and capital groups
announced their intention of remain-1
ing in the conference-, the next move
in the effort to restore industrial
peace to the country evidently rested
with Praisdent Wilson.
Secretary of the Interior Lane will
make a personal report of the situa
tion to the president, but neither
leaders in the conference nor offi
cials generally would venture a pre
diction as to what course Mr. Wil
son would take.
The conference will be called to
gether tomorrow as usual.
Withdrawal of the labor group was j
announced by . President Gompers of ;
the -American Federation of Labor, i
after a' dramatic speech. It came,
only a-fow liurs after Secretary 1
Lane had read a letter in which !
President Wilson, dictating from his
sick bed. appealed for harmony in
the conference and for the final
working out of a program of Indus
trial peace. Representatives of labor
did not join in the applause which
greeted the letter, and Mr. Gompers
characterized as "most unfortunate
a motion by John Spargo, of the pub
lic group, that each group pledge
the president it would make every
effort to accomplish the work for
which the conference was called.
The motion was withdrawn and the
conference recessed so the laboi
group could meet to determine its
future course.
.When the conference convened in
the afternoon, the labor group pro
posed the following resolution:
"The right of wage workers to or
ganize without discrimination, to
bargain collectively, to be represent
ed by representatives of their own
choosing in negotiations and adjust
ments with employers in respect to
wages, hours of labor and relations
and conditions of employment is
recognized."
The resolution was brought to dis
cussion and vote, the labor and pub
lic groups uniting in its support on
the roll call. hTe majority against
the resolution in the capital group
was one vote, but under the confer
ence rules this majority was suffi
cient to defeat the resolution. Mr.
Gompers told the conference the

government. The object is to glorify
the wearing of patched, frayed or

means of combatting the high cost

"Wear your old clothes." was one
of the obligations of membership in

The new organization was said to
be especially popular among clerks
in the marriage license bureau,
where prospective brides and grooms
giggled as they waited for their per
mits. "The high cost of living hasn't hit
them yet," growled one clerk, as he
penned names, ages and addresses on
the proper blanks.
The society is said to have had its
inception in dispatch from London

The American embassy on inquiry

American embassy had been author

to Puebla to assist in obtaining the

The department dispatch quotes
the Mexico City newspaper Excel
sior, as reporting that the bandits
entered a factory owned by Jenkins,
gagged and tied the watchman,
forced the safe and robbed it of ,
60,000 pesos and then took Jenkins
away with them. The bandits are
reported to have told Mrs. Jenkins
that they were rebels and would
hold her husband for 300,000 pesos
ransom. They said Jenkins would
not be harmed if there was no at

Douglas Has Raised More

Average Expected on Co

With an announcement yesterday
from Dr. N. C." Eledsoe, official in
charge of the checkers and timers in
the El Paso-Phoenix road race, that
Douglas has raised more than half
of its quota and will complete its
work today, and another from J. J.
Bowen, chairman of the local race
committee .that speeds of from 35 to
75 miles an hour will be maintained
during the classic, local interest was
increased noticeably yesterday.
Dr. Bledsoe also said that he will
have checkers on both county lines
to get the accurate time consumed
by the racers in going through Co
chise county. It is the hope of local
enthusiasts that the prize for the
fastest time per mile through any
county will be gathered In by Co
chise, although Pinia county Is recog
nized as a close contender.
The general road conditions in Ari
zona were outlined last evening by
Bowen as follows, who was assisted
in some of the computations by I. P.
Frazier, assistant state engineer In
charge of highway work in this dis
trict, and A. W. Jenkins, who is In
charge of the state highway camp at
the Empire ranch. Both these offi
cials have been putting much effort
into whipping the roads in the dis
trict into shape.
The first bad road to be reached
by the racers will be between Mesa
and Florence, where the highway has
been gradd recently and is soft. Be
tween Florence and Tucson. 40 miles
the the highway is 65-miles-an-hour
road," and the remainder Is 45-miles-i
an-hour road. From Tucson to Co
I chise county the racers will make 45
j miles an hour ,it is estimated, and
GO miles through ocluse county
proper.
From Rodeo to El Paso it is esti
mated that an average speed of 35
40 miles an hour will be maintained
Syd Smith, county engineer, has
two gangs of men working steadily
on the roads between Fairbanks and
the Pima county line, and another
between Douglas and Rodeo, and
promises to have all the highway
under his direction in the best of

FOREIGN RELATIONS COMMITTEE
ADOPTS TEN RESERVATIONS TO
PEACE PACT WHICH OPPOSITION
CLAIMS ARE CERTAIN TO CARRY
Withdrawal From League Membership; Article Ten
Right of Congress to Authorize Mandates; National
Supremacy Over Domestic Questions;
Monroe Doctrine and Shantung In
cluded in Subjects Affected
WASHINGTON, Oct. 22. Reopening its considera
tion of the peace treaty, the senate foreign relations com
mittee today adopted ten revised reservations, including a
provision that the senate qualifications must be accepted by
three of the other great powers before the treaty ratifica
tion becomes effective.
Among them was a new proposal which administration
senators declared would break down the economic boycot
feature of the league of nations covenant, and a reserva
tion in article ten differing only in the transposition of one
phrase from that which President Wilson has announced
would treat as a rejection of the treaty.
The ten reservations were part of a list presented by
Ch airman Lodge and declared by the Republican leaders to
represent a compromise behind which a majority of the
senate is pledged to stand.
The administration members of
the committee, headed by Democrat
ic Leader Hitchcock, tried in vain
to secure modification of the ma
jority proposals and then voted sol
idly against all of them.
Showing for the first time, how
ever, a willingness to include res
ervations of ah interpretative char
acter in the ratification resolution,
Senator Hitchcock and his colleagues
offered substitutes for several of
the reservations, but not a single
substitution or change was made at
their suggestion.
The ten subjects covered by the
reservations are:
Withdrawal from League member
ship; article ten; the right of con
gress to authorize mandates; national
supremacy over domestic questions;
the Monroe Doctrine; Shantung; lim
itations on the reparations commis
penses; the right to increase arma

This feature of the majority plan
aroused particular opposition among
the Democrats who had stood determ
inedly against any qualification that
would require reopening of negotia
tions. The administration forces also
objected strenously -to th.j article ten
reservation, and , to Uie one permit
ting trade between the nationals of
the United States and the nationals
of a couvenant-breaking state. That
privilege they asserted would upset
the plan for the automatic boycott
which league adocates have declared
would be substituted in many cases
for war.
Actions on three reservations on
the majority program was deferred,
and it was said more would be added
to the list before the next meeting
of the committee. The three passed
over would provide that congress ap
point the American delegates to the

"You have defeated the labor In

conference. You have by your action

is cast. We can nor. remain longer."
Representatives of the four rail
road brotherhoods remained in tho
conference ur-til the session ad
journed, but they announced they did
so "out of courtesy to the other dele
gates," and that ihey were in accord
with the main body of the labor
group.
Mr. Spargo asked the labor dele
gates not to' make their decision ir
revocable, but to remain with the
understanding that the conference
"would proceed to develop and form
ulate a general program which will
clearly define and establish the rlghi
of collective bargaining."
Calling attention that, only a "very
small majority" of the members of
teh conference had voted against the
collective bargaining resolution,
whMe about fifty favored it. Dr.
Charles W. Eliot of the public group,
said this inconsistency was due to
the "impossible rules" under whicti
the convention worked.
Harry A. Wheeler, chairman of the
employers' group, in announcing the
intention of his group to remain
here for further work, said capital
representatives would not accept the
responsibility for breaking up the
conference. He declared they had

Y. W. GIRLS
TO PRESENT
2 PLAYLETS
Two playlets will be presented by
the young women of the Y. W. C. A.
at the high school gymnasium at 8:15
o'clock tomorrow evening. To first
is "Engaging Janet," and the second,
"Fudge and the Burglar."
The story of "Engaging Janet" is
that of a girl who has tired of school
and . of a too persistent lover, and
who advertises for a position as a
"female help." Her experiences as
an Associated hCaritie sworker, book
agent, traveliu gsaleslady for a pow
der firm, and school teacher, are
very amusing. Finally she realizes
that she is not fitted for this kind
of life, and tells her maid to an
nounce that she is engaged to
Arthur, her devoted suitor.
"Fudge and the burglar" detailB
the happenings in a cbllege girl's
room about midnight, where a num
ber are engaged in making fudge and
visiting, when another college girl,
who has not been invited to the lit
tle celebration, appears, disguised as
a burglar, and demands not only tho
money and silver in the room, but
also the food on the table. After a
substantial' meal, she removes her
disguise and the complications are
cleared up. . .. .
Tickets for the( entertainment are
25 cents each,' and will be sold at
the door. .

The Central Competitive District
embraces' the soft coal fields ot west
ern Pennsylvania, Ohio, and Indiana.
This district supplies 50 per cent
of the soft coal mined in the United
States.
This coal runs the railroads and
almost all of the steam plants north
of the Ohio and east of Chicago to
beyond the Pennsylvania line, and
in addition thousands of tons are
shipped east.
Columbus, Ohio, is the geographical
center of the district.
The three large coal areas in the
Central competitive District produce
annually about 300,000,009 tons.
Western Pennsylvania's output, 175,
000.000; Indiana's, 86,000,000; Ohio's,
40,00,000.
All the other 27 bituminous coal
producing states, including.rWest Vir
ginia, with 90,000,000 tons, . can pro
duce about as much as the Central
Competitive District alone.
So great is the increased consump
tion of soft coal that ten years ago
the whole United States mined only
332,000,000 tons and this supplied the
demand and left some for export,
principally to Canada. i
In the Central Competitive District
is a manufacturing and industrial
center approached in magnitude only
by the Atlantic seaboard section.
The number of miners employed
runs from 250,000 to 30Q.000, and they
are thoroughly organized.
The present wage agreement runs
"during the continuation of the war

AMERICAN BRAND OF FREEDOM
THE FEVERISH strike movement is reaching its crest. Thought
ful leaders of organized labor are sounding a note of warning.
At last the long-suffering public is in rebellion, refusing longer
to be ground to powder between the millstones of capital ana
labor. What the public did to capital when it became a menace to
society some twenty years ago, it threatens openly to do to labor,
unless the latter places restraint upon its radical advisers, who have
been driving it far beyond the boundaries of reason or justice.
The most trustworthy labor leaders realize ths peril of the sit
uation. They appreciate that the. third' factor in every strike, here
tofore unrecognized, is the most powerful, and that is the public.
From Leslie's.
There is no more right or justice in a labor organization forcing
a man to belong to a certain union before he can work, or trying to
force an employer to hire none but members of a certain union, than
there is in a church or political party using the same dictatorial
policy before they would allow a man to work or live in a community.
The American brand of freedom and dictation from any class or
organization do not go together. Dictation will falL
GASOLINE PRODUCTION GROWING
THERE has been a decrease In total consumption of gasoline com
pared with first six months of 1918, the aggregate being 1,614,
5S:;.078 gallons, against 1,768,211,121. Domestic consumption
showed a large increase, being 1,427,057,162 gallons in the first
si xmonths of 1919, against 1,355,885,934 gallons in the same period
of 1918. ' While foreign demand fell below war requirements, it Is
steadily increasing.
Production of gasoline in the six months' period ended Jiine 30,
1919, amounted to 1,911,152,705 gallons, or 296,569,627 gallons more
than were consumed.
Increase in domestic consumption of gasoline is taken to indi
cate general expansion of the gasoline industry in this country In
line with the increase in motor vehicle manufacture.
That the aeroplane will have an effect on the demand for high
grade gasoline in the near future is generally believed.
The temporary falling off in foreign demand gives this country
an opportunity to build up reserve supply and perfect a national
policy encouraging to the development of our oil lands. If we fall
to adopt a constructive national policy toward development of oil
lands, we can look for consumption to again exceed production In
the course of a few years.
RUSSIAN SUGAR SITUATION
ACCORDING to advices received by Lamborn & Co. from Europe,
the Russian sugar industry has disintegrated to a degree incon
ceivable except to those in Touch with conditions. Famine con
ditions prevail. Their correspondent . writes: "When you con
sider that it took France 110 years to develop her industry under
high protection, to the point of practically her consumptive demands,
you can well understand thai those who talk about re-establishing
such an industry in Iwa years or at the outside, three, -must be well
nigh crazy. With defeat of Bolshevism you may look forward to the
greatest demand the world has ever known from Russia. I believe
Russia would take not less than 750,000 tons if it were available, in
the very first year of stable govtrnment. I am satisfied that if It
were available France would use 1,000,000 tons per annum instead
of her pre-war consumption.
Russia before the war was regarded as a menace to the sugar
industry in other countries, because cf her low cost of production,
due to cheap labor, and her vast areas susceptible to cultivation.
Now is the time for American sugar farmers and American beet
sUp.rar producers to so thoroughly develop and establish the western
beet sugar industry that it will forever more be able to meet compe
tition. Our state and national governments should do everything
possible to encourage and perpetuate this industry, which has twice
in the past three vears saved a sugar famine in this nation.
OPPOSED TO TITLES
THE PARLIAMENT of the Dominion of Canada has approved a
resolution addressed to the king, politely asking the British
monarch to refrain in future from conferring any title of honor
or any titular distinction upon any citizen of Canada. The
resolution particularly is directed against hereditary titles. Honors
of a purely professional or vocational character are not prescribed.
The parliament was unanimous in indorsing the resolution for the
king's guidance.
There are savcral reasons for Canada's opposition to titles. One
is- the Dominion's unfortunate experiences with titles, one of her
peers and at least one knight being far from objects of national pride.
Anoiher ami wider reason is that Most Canadians believe there- is a
serious danger in the rehabilitation of aristocratic institutions in
the empire by the creation of a much enlarged body of title-beiring
persons. The New Zealanuers evidenced a similar suspicion a few
years ago when a ranh premier accepted a title and was defeated by
a decidedly more conservative opposition leader who could boast
that he was "plain Bill Massey."
It is probable that the next lint of the king s honors will be con
spicuous for the absence of. Canadian names.
We get only 4 1-4 per cent on the money we lend England, while
she gpts 7 per cent from Persia. But then, we have no strangle hold
on Eughind.
Te department of agriculture informs us that the world's supply
of food animals is about ihe same as before the war. Publication of
the fact convinces us that the packers' censor is loafing on the Job.
In the old days before there was so much talk about tho Ameri
can tandaid of living, fewer men wore silk shirts
Once upon a lime, the man who got his nalne on the sucker list
received many offers of fake stock. Now he receives an equal
amount of political propaganda.
Back in the stone pro, before men learned to talk, there were no
statesmen.
The first little task of the league will lie to find a way to make
people da what their governments agree lo do.
You can find Europe's new boundary linos on new maps, but that
is the only place you tan find them.
Belief in the equality of men is held by those who can't afford
to hire' servants!
The salaried man feels a deep sympathy for the poor mechanic
who is burdened with the task of spending eight dollars every day.

MESA SCHOOL TEACHERS I
DISPLEASED WITH RAISE j
MESA, Oct. 22. Teachers ot the
Mesa schools who were . granted a
raue of five per cent at the recent
meeting of the school board, and in
cluding all instructors " woh in the
past had received less 'than $116 per
month, held a meeting yesterday aft
ernoon in Guild hall for the purpose
of protesting the raise. A large
number of teachers attended the
meeting.
Sentiment expressed ;at the meet
ing by most of the instructors wait
that the raise granted is not in pro
portion to the salaries of teachers in
ether parts of the state, ir in pro
portion, either, to the demands of
the high cost of living. Even with

FLAGSTAFF, Oct. 22. An event
tath will be of exceeding interest and
importance to every farmer in the
county is the competitive farm trac

The idea was suggested by Z. A.

Hart-Parr tractor, who also Issued a
challenge to the other tractor agents
here t put their machines at work
side by side with his to demonstrate

of operation. The idea was immed
ii'te'.y seized upon by all but ona of
the competing agents, the date fixed,
and the. scene of the gas-scrap will
soon be decided upon.
This event is a time-saver. It
saves both the time of the prospeje

the agents themselves, inasmuch as
they will be able to demonstrate to

CLIFTON, Oct. 22. Cattle esti
mated to be worth $60,000 and one
of the largest gatherings of yearlings,
two- and three-year olds made in
this section in recent years, will be
shipped from Clifton within this and
the following week. Large herds ot
cattle have been arriving front all
parts of the county and country triV
utary to Clifton, and are being quar
tered at the local pens north of Clif
ton, awaiting cars for their transpor
tation to market.
The large part of the shipment wa.
purchased by the well known firm
of Cook & Johnson, of Willcox, Ari

Bros., Jud Webster, Suthcrlin &
Wright, Fred Fritz, Swift & Eldrage,
Tom McCuIlouch, Dick Miller, George
Montgomery, Bill 'Edwards, Harvey
Gatlin, Bill Zuniwalt, and Johnnie
Brown.
The stock industry .of Arizona and
New Mexico is in an unusually pros
perous condition, owing to the ire
vailing high prices and the excelleni
range resulting from generous rains.
The stockmen, in view of their losses
and sufferings in - the past, not to
mention their hardihood and man
hood, their sterling worth as citizens
and patriots deserve the prosperity
they are now enjoying.

Mr. Bowen, who has just returned from a visit to the coast, who was very
pleasant, and who spoke about the' road race, which will occur soon. Which
made me think that it will be on a Sunday, and that I will not have to
write about it until the next day. To Dr. Bledsoe, who also talked about
the race, being an official in it. My wife to the market in Lowelf this day,
which made me think that the ranchers there have experienced a new thrill,
for she Is a woman of a single mind, and that is all her own. Hope there
were no casualties. To watch the fighters again, sitting very still and in
viting no trouble, being too far from home for re-infercemehts, and even
then not certain but what she would league herself with' the enemy. To
Judge Allison's court, where I met Mr. Wilmoth, the United States marshal,
who told me about the activities of his qffice. and who also praised Douglas,
which seemeth to me to be a forward thing to do, having seen that city and
more than filled with it in a few hours. Did meet an old newspaper friend,
with whom I talked long, he and I descanting upon the shortcomings of edi

RYAN SUCCUMBS TO INJURIES
RECEIVED IN AUTO ACCIDENT
James C. Ryan, highway) engineer
for Cochise county, who was famil
iarly known to thousands of Arizon
ans as 'Dick Ryan, ana who was
fatally injured early Sunday morn
ing when an automobile in which
he was riding collided with a heavy
truck, on the Don Luis road, died at
the C. & A. hospital about 5 o'clock
yesterday morning. His wife, pa
rents and borthers were with Aim
when the end came. '
Although he was known to be se
riously injured, physicians who at
tend him had hopes of his recovery
during Monday, but on Tuesday
pneumonia attacked him, and al
though he rallied slightly on Tues
day afternoon he became steadily
worse during the night. He had but
brief intervals of consciousness since
the hour of the accident. He was
33 years of age.
Announcement of the serious na
ture of the accident which had oc
curred 10 him, and the forecast on
Tuesday that he might not survive
it, brought messages of condolence
and sympathy from every section of
southern Arizona. He had been a
leading figure in the political and
social life of. thi3 part of the coun
ty foe years, and boasted a large and
constantly increasing number of
friends.
Ryan was born in Denver, Colo.,
on April 10, 1886, the son of John
C. and Emma J. Ryan. He wa3 ed
ucated in the public schools of Den
ver and Pueblo, graduating from the
high school of the latter place. He
immediately started his career in
his favorite subject of study of en
gineering. Ryan began engineering
work, as a member of the corps inj
charge of building the Nacozari rail-j
road, in Sonora, Mexico. Upon the
completion of this ' work he joined
the railroad building forces of the
Phelps Dodge corporation, remaining
with them until April, 1916, when he j
entered the employ of tue Gila Val-
ley, Globe & Northern railway as
instrument jnan. He was sodn proH
moted to resident engineer in charge
of that division.
In February, 1910, Ryan was em
ployed by the territory and . state as
bridge builder, and had charge of
the construction of two of the big
eest and best built, structures on i
the territorial highway.
His next advance was his appoint
ment as assistant to Lamar; Cobb,
while"1 the latter was state -engineetvf
While accupying this position, Ryan
came to Cochise county and built
the famous Bisbee-Tombstone high
way over the divide, one of the fin
est pieces of road work in the south
west. His work on this highway
attracted so much favorable atten-i
tion that he was chosen as county j
engineer of Cochise county, whicn
position he held for four years. He
was then selected as engineer for
the county highway commission. For
HOW I BECAME A PRIMA DONNA
By ROSA POXSELLE
Leading Soprano, Metropolitan Opera House
Xew York City
CHAPTER XVI My Early Lessons.
"I have a dramatic soprano voice,"
a young- woman said in a letter 1
recently received, "Ho you advise me
to study for opera? Could I make
a debut at the Metropolitan, and if
I did do you think I could make a
success like yours?"
In all other respects this letter
was most Intelligent. The writer
lived in a city of seventy-live thou
sand, and was a high school gradu
ate. Yet she had asked me three
questions she should have known I
could not answer without hearing
her sing and talking with her.
If our young women and young
men. too would only pause to con
aider and seek expert and unpreju
diced advice a great many heart
aches would be saved, aTTd much
money foolishly expended. For not
one person, with a voice, in a hun
dred has the operatic equipment.
I was anxious to get my teacher's
verdict as to the probable possibili
ties for me, but I was loath to ask
Ids opinion until my tenth lesson.
Then I put my question with diffi
dence. He did not Immediately respond.
He sat studying me intently, for
soma time, before answering.
"You want to sing in opera?"
I admitted that this w:is r.iy se-ret
ambition.
'Well," ho said, in that deliberate
way of his, "you will. S xitmr. too.
than you thir.k. nut you mustn't
lot that give you a false estimate of
jour capabilities. You havo un-U!-ual
talent; nn unusual vol. c" (he
vas very cli.iry with his praWe) "and
you arc a good musician. What else
do you suppose p.n opera singer must
have?"
He made mo feel rather Incapable,
at that moment, which may have
bren his Intention. He realized the
Importance of cultivating in his pu
pils a. feeling of coiilidence: but he
als'o'knew the clanger of injudicious
encouragement, which is harmful.
I did not try to reply. I merely
watted for what else my maestro
should say.
"If I were to nay that you would
do speciile things at a given time
omethim? might occur to prevent.
I shouldn't want to do that. So we
.will just go ou working-. I have my
the last two years Ryan had charge
of all work ordered by the highway
commission in connection with the
construction of roads authorized by
the highway bond issue of two years
ago.
He was a man of unbounded en
thusiasm and energy, and in every
public movemeit launched in Cochise
county he took a commanding part.
He was particularly active during
the war, when he lent himself with
out stint to every patriotic purpose.
At the time of his death he was
the center of a warm political fight
but even in this his integrity, cour
age and honesty kept the personal
friendship of those to whom he op
posed in public matters.
He was married in 1907 to Miss
Grace Boyd of Safford, Ariz., who,
with their three sons, John David,
Richard Arthur and Ed Boyd, sur
vive him. In addition to these he
leaves his parents, Mr. and Mrs. J.
C. Ryan, and six brothers, E. N. and
J. F. Ryan, who are employed by
the E. P. & S. W. railway; J. D.
Ryan,' a brakeman on the E. P. &
S. W. railway; G. R. Ryan, travel
ing auditor for the Phelps Dodge
company; A. E. Ryan, a lieutenant
with the American expeditionary
forces in Siberia, and an adopted
brother, Morris Ryan.
The body is at the Palace under
taking establishment. . Funeral serv
ices will be conducted at 4 o'clock
this afternoon at St. Patrick's church
where the Rev. Fr. Constance Man

Special Session of
Legislature in 1920
PHOENIX, Oct. 22. A special ses
sion of the Arizona legislature will
be called early in 1920 to consider
ratification of the federal constitu
tional amendment granting suffrage
to women, it was announced hereto
day by Governor Campbell. The gov
ernor made this announcement fol
lowing his telegraphing Governor
Stephens of California that he would
not call a special session immediately
to ratify the suffrage amendment.
The telegram was sent in. answer
to one from Governor Stephens ask
ing him if he would call a special
session Immedaitely if certain other
western governors would agree to
take like action.
Governor Campbell said he did not
think it necessary to call a" specla;
session now, as there were no mat
ters aside from suffrage to be con
sidered, while there would be other
matters demanding legislative action
by spring. The governor did not
state the exact date on which he
would convene the ligislature, nor
when he would issue the call.
ideas, but it Is better I should keep
them to myself. However, you have
done enough, progressed sufficiently.
to show me conclusively that you
are fitted to" try for opera. Barring
mishaps," he added.
"In a year?" I asked, impulsively,
I fear.
He laughed. . "Now you are try
ing to commit me; that's bad. Pos
sibly you will be ready then. 'But
there Is much for you to accomplish,
as I have already told you. You
must be patient. One cannot force
the voice. It Isn't a hot-house pro
cess, training the singing voice. It
must be carried along slowly, as
nature intends. Nothing ever la
gained by haste. Often the singer
has a setback, through endeavor
ing to hurry. Rest content that
when the time comes you will know
as well as I."
That was all. I couftl get nothing
further. But I was encouraged, in
the right way, and I worked with
keener desire -to make r.y;c!f as
perfect as I knew how.
It wasn't easy. I had 1 ceil produc

CARTIER MONUMENT
In September, 1914, the statue
commemorating the centennial anni

Cartier was to have been unveiled
and plans had been made for a fitting
tribute to the memory of the great
Canadian statesman, but once more
the best laid plans of man went
wrong. The celebration was held
five years late.
On the fateful 4th of August, 1914,
one of the figures at the base of the
statue, work of the famous Canadian
sculptor George W. Hill, lay on the
wharf at Antwerp awaiting ship
ment. Suddenly the gathering war

' vainly battling against the onslaught

THE BISBEE DAILY REVIEW
THURSDAY, OCTOBER 23, 1919
Mining and Financial News
BY REVIEW LEASED WIRE
STOCKS AND BONDS
NEW YORK, Oct. 22 Stocks con
tinued to surge forward in today's ex
tremely active market, further easing
.of money and the more encouraging
surveys of the steel and iron indus
try contributing perceptibly to the im
provement. Call loans fell to 5 per cent, the
lowest quotation in several weeks,
time funds relaxed slightly and main
tenance of the prevailing rate of re
discount by the federal reserve bank
was accepted as a favorable augury.
Trade authorities asserted that pig
iron and finished steel production in
the past week increased to a 60 per
cent basis, despite the deadlock in the
steel strike. According to the Iron
Age prices of some fabricated prod
ucts have been advanced, with pros
pects of premium offerings' for speedy
delivery.
Steels and the many equipment Is
sues which move in sympathy with
that group displayed marked strength,
Republic Iron leading on its his.e of
18 points to 120 in the last hour,
this constituting a new record.
During the greater part of the ses
sion, however, oils, motors and affil
iated specialties were again the over
shadowing features. New maximums
were made by Texas company, Mexi
can and Pan-American petroleums,
General Motors and Bjaldwin Locomo
tive at extreme advances of 6 to 16
points. Sinclair was . strong on an
nouncement that a largje sum had been
set aside to increase th,e company's ca
pacity in the middle west. Other prom
inent features at gross gains of 3 to
12 points included such varied issues
as Remington Typewriter, Columbia
Graphophone, Corn Products, Retail
Stores, Hide and Leather preferred
and Burns Brothers. Chemical, ferti
lizer, paper and utility issues em
braced the other active stocks at
gains of 1 to 3 points. Sales were
1,725,000 shares.
Reaction in speculative rails caused
moderate irregularity in the bond mar
ket, although the Liberty group was
steady, with 3's at 101, repeating the
year's highest prices. Total sales, par
value, $14,300,000. Old United States
bonds were unchanged on call.
THE CORN MARKET
CHICAGO, Oct. 22. Sndications that
country offerings of corn had been
checked made the corn market rally
today from a decline d?u to demorali
zation of hog values. Corn closes firm
at the same as yesterday's finish to
lc higher with December $1.24
to $1.25 and May $1.22 to $1.22.
Oats gained c to c. The outcome
In provisions was unchanged to 40c
lower.
At first bears had things much their
own way in the corn market. Big new
breaks in the price of hogs resulted In
considerable speculative selling.- Tem
porarily too, buyers were further dis
couraged, owing to the fact that con
trary to expectation the longshore
men's strike was still unsettled. It
was not long, though, before the ma
jority of traders became convinced
that the downward swing of the corn
market was shutting off BupDlies from
rural sources and that no distress H
ouidatlon on the part of holders had
taken place. Shorts then grew nerv
ous. and export buying of oata accel
erated the late upturn.
Onts sympathized with the early
weakness of corn, but afterward
Fhowed independence. Revival of ex
port, demand was noted. Including
lOO.OOO bushels bought here for the
seaboard
Provisions were depressed by the
eollapup of the hoe market, but grain
strength acted later as an offset in
part. " "nlr
