BRITISH HDL
POSITIONS IN
NORTH; HEM
FIGHTING ON
Inverness Copse, on Ypres
Menin Road, Is Scene of
Sanguinary Conflict Ger
mans Counter Attack With
No Success.
(By Review Leaned Wire).
BRITISH FRONT IN FRANCE AND
BELGIUM, Aug. 23. Despite
heavy enemy counter attacks dur
ing the night the British today
were holding strongly the positions
they captured yesterday along a front
varying in depth from a few hundred
yards to half a mile.
Even the Inverness Copse, astride
the Ypres-Menin l'oad, where the Ger
mans were so strongly fortified that
one would scarcely have dared to pre
dict success for an attack was partly
in British possession after hand to
hand fighting which continued through
out yesterday and into the night.
In the other important battle there
were ton the front the Canadians last
night and this morning made still fur
ther advances on their southwest front.
Early today they attacked the German
positions at the Green Grassier, north
of the Souchez river.
Last night the Canadians also push
ed forward two strong forces adjoining
the Green. Grassier to the northwest.
The situation at Lens, Lbwever, has
been more or less quiet as a whole
since yesterday morning. ,
Fighting still continues north and
east of Ypres. The British secured
the strong position in Inverness Copse
and their line runs approximately
through a point in the center of this
wood from the north and south, but
north of it tile Germans are in pos
session of a large machine gun posi
tion which dominate the northern po
sition of the wood and these guns add
to the difficulties of the situation for
the British.
Machine Guns Deadly
The British made their advances
into the Inverness Copse in the face of
extremely heavy machine gun fire
from points to the north and south.
The ground is marshy and hard to tra
verse but the British forced their way
forward to the wood, where they threw
themselves into the Germans with bay
onets and L'jnibs and drove the enemy
back. Heavy counter attacks failed
to dislodge the British from the line
where they had finally rested, half
way -through the wood.
Menin Road Battle
Similar sanguinary fighting also oc
curred a litte north or Glencorse
Wood, where there was a nest of ma
chine guns. In the Ypres-Menin road
sector the British penetrated the Ger
man defenses to a depth of about 500
yards over a front of about a mile,
In a bigger battle further north the 'your hands the letters whereby you
British reduced many exceedingly I are accredited as the ambassador-ex-strong
German concrete redoubts and traordinary and plenipotentiary of.Ja-
strongbolds which had figured in much
of the fighting heretofore.
One of these, which was the scene
of a strenuous battle before the Brit
ish finally subdued its garrison, was
itounter attacked determinedly by the
eneaty later in the day but the at
tack was driven off with considerable
losses to the Germans.
Along this front the British pene-
trated to an extreme depth of over half
a mile, thei-eby securing much of the
ground which they had failed to gain
in the bitter offensle of last Thurs
day. A considerable number of prisoners
have been sent back but no 'official re
port is yet available.
Denial Made of
Any Impending
Bisbee Trouble
i
PHOENIX. Aug. 23. Governor
Campbell tonight denied any knowl
edge Xt important developments pend
ing in the Bisbee situation. When the
suggestion was made that the Indus
trial Workers of the World and their
sympathizers, deported from Bisbee,
might be returned from Columbus, N.
M., the executive said there had been
considerable correspondence through
his office looking to such return, but
that tfo far as he knew nothing definite
had as et resulted. If the Arizona
exiles are now on their way from the
camp at Columbus he was without In
formation to that effect.

Viscount Ishii
Is Presented to
The President
(By Review Leased Wire.)
WASHINGTON, August 23. Vis
count Ishii, special ambassador and
head of Japan's mission to the United
States, presented his credentials to
President Wilson late today and with
them an autographed letter from .his
emperor congratulating the president
and the people of the United States
upcn their decision to enter the war
against Germany.
Guests of Wilson.
Tonight Viscount Ishii and the mem
bers of his mission were the guests of
the president at a state dinner in the
white house, closing a day of formal
calls of courtesy preceding the import
ant conferences at which the business
of the visitors will be discussed.
1 Bears Welcome.
Presenting his credentials to the
president. Viscount Ishii said:
"Mr. President: On this occasion I
have the good fortune to be the bearer
of a special message of welcome and
deep appreciation from His Imperial
Majesty, the Emperor of Japan, to the
president of the and sovereign people
of the United States of America, on
their momentous decision to co-operate
in the great war now raging.
Emperor Congratulatory.
"His Majesty, interpreting the unan
imous sentiment of Japan, congratu-1
lates your great country on this de
termination. It has been arrived at,
not lightly and In a moment of pas
sion, but after the exercise of a noble
patience and in a spirit of unselfish
chivalry which have excited the ad
miration of the whole world. That
America is now fighting on the side of
Japan is a source of pride to His Maj
esty and to every Japanese
"It is not the first time I may be al
lowed to remind you, Mr. President,
that this has happened. In 1900 I
had the privilege of seeing with my
own eyes, the American and Japanese
colors waving together when the al
lied troops, in the face of terrible dif
ficulties triumphantly relieved the be
seiged legations at' Peking.
"I well remember the skill and cour
age with which the American civilians
and soldiers co-operated in the de
fense. The resourceful bravery which
those few Americans showed then,
American legions will show now.
Co-Operation Commended.
"The auspicious co-operation of the
United States of America and Japan in i
the tremendous task of restoring the
reign of mutual confidence and good
will among the nations of the earth,
cannot but draw us closer together.
Our common efforts are directed to
seeking an enduring peace, based on
respect for the independence of the
smallest and weakest states, on con
tempt of the arrogance of materialistic
force, on reverence for the pledged
word. In the service of these com
mon ideals our two countries must
surely realize a far nearer friendship
than before.
"This is no ordinary war. It is an
issue between common morality and
inhuman system of calculated aggres
sion which would rather render friend
ly intercourse. I welcome the fact
that the United States stands side by
side with Japan in this great war."
The president said in replying:
Wilson Accepts.
"Mr. Ambassador: It is with a sense
of deep satisfaction that I receive from
pan in a special mission to the United
States. It is a pleasure to accept
through you from your imperial sov
erign congratulations of the entrance
of the United States into the great
conflict which is now raging.
"The present struggle is especially
characterized by development of tho
spirit of co-operation throughout the
greater part of the world for the main-
tainence of the rights of nations and
liberties of individuals. I assure your
excellency that standing as our coun
tries now do associated in this strug
gle for the vindication of justice there
will be developed those closer ties of
fellowship which must come from the
mutual sacrifice of life and property.
May the efforts now being exerted by
an indignant humanity lead, at the
proper time, to the complete estab
lishment of justice and to a peace
which will be both permanent and se
rene. "I trust your excellency will find
your sojourn among us most agreeable
and I should be gratified if you would
be so good as to make known to his
imperial majesty my best wishes for
his welfare, for your wonderful coun
try and the happiness of its people.
"I am most happy to accord you rec
ognition in your high capacity."
The guests at the -white house din
ner tonight included Justices of the
supreme court, cabinet officers, promi
nent members of congress and rank
ing officers of the army and navy. To
morrow Viscount Ishii will go to the
capital to call on Senator Saulsberry,
president pro tem of the senate .and
Speaker dark.
NEGRQ TROOPS IN RIOT
HOUSTON, Texas, August 23. Twelve white men, Hvilians. police
officers and national guardsmen were killed and more than a score of
persons, men, women and children, wounded in an outbreat tonight of
negro soldiers of the Twenty-fourtiie United States Infantry, station
ed here to act as guards during the construction of Camp Logan at
which the Illinois National Guard will train. It is not known how
many negroes are dead.
Cpptain J. W. Mattes, battery A. second Illinois field artillery, was
among the dead. He wps killed when he tried to remonstrate with
the nero soldiers who were running rampant. . .
The outbreak is supposed to have originated when i6 negro soldiers
were arrested for disturbing the peace early in the afternoon .
The firing began when an ambulance'started through the section
occupied 'by the negro soliders. They stopped the ambulance and firing
a volley, riddled it. It was this volley that wounded a 16-year old
white girl standing in her fathers' store. ;
Police reserves were sena out and were met by volleys from the ne
groes. Civilians went to the assistance of the police officers and fir
ing continued for an hour and a half.

Texas Governor
Must Face Trial
AUSTIN, Texas, August 23. The
Texas house of representatives tonight
by a vote of S2 to 51 adopted a reso
lution to present to the senate articles
lof Impeachment against governor
James E. i-erguson. a committee oi
nine was appointed immediately to
draw up articles of Impeachment and
report the articles to the house as the
first business tomorrow morning. The
action was taken as the result of the
investigation of charges filed by Speak
er F.'o. Fuller, against the govemoi
alleging illegal acts in office.
The investigation which ended today
had been going on almost three weeks.
The speaker issued a call for a session
of the house to consider impeachment
late In July. Governor Ferpuson lat
er called the entire legislature !n spec
ial session to consider passage of the
state university appropriation bills
which he had vetoed. The senate took
op ttfese bills on August 1. the day of
convening, the latter passed them, but
the house proceeded to the Impeach
ment investigation.
Much of the stir which caused the
investigation resulted from the gover
nor's attitude toward the university.

Russia Center
Of Interest In
United States
tBy Review Leased Wire I
WASHINGTON, Aug. 23. The sit
uation in Russia continued as the ren
ter of war interest here today with the
mystery surrounding the nature of of
ficial dispatches the government has
received fi'jm Petrograd within the
last 48 hours still undiBpelled. Cryp
tic news dispatches from the Russian
capital referring to speculation in Pet
rograd and Moscow newspapers con
cerning "expected dramatic announce
ments of events,". and expressing the
view of the press that "if no agree
ment is reached between the contend
ing groups open conflict must follow,"
were taken to support the interpreta
tion of government dispatches as re
lating to political conditions within the
provisional government and probably
undercurrents of German intrigue
working for the unseating of Premier
Kerensky with either a counter revo
lution seeking tt re-establish the auto
cracy or the breaking down altogether
of the provisional government and re
sulting chaos.
Condition Critical
Russia's critical internal situation,
aggravated by the new German drive
against Riga, threatening the capital,
is watched by officials here with grave
concern. It became known today that
official advices are closely in accord
with press dispatches describing grave
political conditions.
The outcome of the forthcoming ex
traordinary national council to be held
at Moscow is awaited here with inter
est scarcely less keen than in Russia
itself. The immediate fate of Russia,
it is felt, depends upon it. (
Conservatives Must Unite
Out of the great gathering, in which
the conservative elements of all sorts
are expected to unite in an ef.Vrt to
compel the provisional government to
throw off the Socialistic control of the
soldiers' and workmen's council, one
of two results is expected, the .forma
ti'on of a strong centralized government
capable of rapidly reorganizing' the
army and resuming the offensive
against the central powers, or open
civil strife.
Problem Discussed
It appears that little can be done by
outside influence, even that of the Am
erican government, to help immediate
ly in the crisis. The problem was dis
cussed today at a conference by Secre
taries Lansing, McAdoo and Baker. It
is understood that attention was given
chiefly to the financial and industrial
aid which the United States can and
will give and the assurance of which
is counted upon to strengthen the hand
of the Russian provisional authorities.
Ambassador Bakhmetieff spent virtual
ly the entire day at the treasury talk
ing over with officials the financial
needs of his government
Consideration for Rumania
In Connection with furthe radvances
of money to Russia, consideration also
is being given to the case of the hard-
pressed Rumania, whose troops are
fighting with the Russians to stop the
Teutonic drive In the southeast. It is
understood that any loan that may be
arranged for Rumania will be handled
thi'jugh Russia.
German Intrigues
German intrigues in Russia are
known to be exerting powerful Influ
ence to bring about anarchy within
the new democracy. Just how they
are playing their game in reference to
the opposing elements has not been
revealed.
At the Russian embassy it was to
night announced that no news concern
ing the situation in the Riga region
had been received. The view there
appears still to be optimistic. It was
said that the German Offensive had
been looked for and regarding the pou
sible cutting off of the railroad lin
from Archangel, it was pointed out
that the port of Archangel would be
ice-bound in September.
Embassy officials explained that
great results were locked for from the
new arrangements for dealing wltfl
the troops through a committee com
posed of generals, commanding offi
cers of the army and delegates fro:
the army. The committee, it was said,
are working to create harmony and the
chief function of the government com
missioners is to enlighten the soldiers
on the objects of the war, answer ques
tion regarding political matter and
otherwise aid in restoring the morale,
Russia's chief task now, it was declar
ed, is the transportation of supplies
and munitions and the aid expected
from the United States will g far to
ward the solution of that problem.

Italians Press Ahead. i
On both the northern and southern
ends of the battle line in the Austro
Italian theatre the Italians have press-1
ed forward their line for considerable i
new gains against the Austrians. The !
counter attacks of the Austrians are j
of the roost extreme violence but no-1
where have they been able to dislodge ,
the Italians. An Instance or tbls is trie
holding for three days under most vic
ious counter-attacks, of a strong Aus

oners already have been taken tyr the
Italians.
Extent Unknown.
Although the-- exact extent or the
Italians advance has not yet become
apparent and the objective aimed at is
not definitely known. General Cadorna
over the entire 37 miles or the fighting
front has everywhere made progress
and the Austrians are reported unoffi
cially to be stripping Trieste of its
valuables and moving them to Vienna
and other places.
The chier British military observer,
Major-Geheral Mourice, says the Ital
ians already have gained an important
victory which gives promise or de
veloping presently into a victory of
the first magnitude.
Retreat In Force.
East of Riga the Russians have fal

the line from Raggedzem. on the Gulf

German gains in this region, says the
Russians evacuated positions without
offering battle, previously have de
stroyed several villages behind them.
No Gains In South.
To the south In Volhynla the Ger
mans have also delivered attacks
against the Russians for gains or ter
ritory but they were dislodged in
counter-attacks. No important gains
in this region have been made by eith
er or the combatants.
In Russia the political situation
again is to the Tore. Petrograd news
papers take the pessimistic view that
unless an agreement is reached by po
litical groups is reached at the ap
proaching extraordinary national
council to be held at Moscow, opea
conflict must follow.

during the year, the work being car
ried on continuously by one Xr the
other of the men of the bureau.
The state has been divided into tlree
trips; the southern and eastern trip
will include lecture courses at No
gales, Patagonia, Tombstone, Bisbee,
Douglas, Globe, Miami, Safford. Clif
ton, Morenci, Duncan and Willcox.
The western trip will include lecture
work at Casa Grande, Ajo and Yuma.
The northern trip will mean that stops
will be made at Hayden, Ray, Phoe
nix, Wickenburg, Prescott, Mayer,
Humboldt, Clarkdale, Jerome, King
man, Oatman, Winsolw, Flagstaff and
Williams.
The courses to be given in the above
mentioned towns will be distinctly
continuous courses, occupying three
days. The work of the safety engi
neer of the bureau, S. C. Dickinson,
will include courses In first aid in
towns and cities where first aid train
ing is not now available, and in the
larger mining camps where such work
is available at the present time his
work shall be in the nature "of safety
education.
The work of G. R. Fansett. rock anal
yst of the bureau of mines, will be
to give courses of instruction in min
eral and rock identification. This
work is invaluable to the prospector
and is such that it is believed that
the courses will be very largely at.
tended. '
The - field tf work of M. A. Allen,
mineral technologist of the bureau,
will be principally to stimulate the
production of the rare metals needed
for war purposes, a swell as instruc
tional work in the technology of the
metals and minerals and the encour
agement of their proper and conserva
tive utilization.
It is planned that the work will be
either demonstrations or illustrated
lectures, and will be accompanied by
moving pictures on affiliated and re
lated subjects. It is also expected
that all of the lectures, while in the
various towns of the state, will talk
before high schools, boy scouts, wom
en's clubs and any tother organizations
that may desire such services.
There is to be absolutely no cost at
tendant upon this work, it being one
of the methods to be used in bringing
the work of the bureau of mines dir
ectly to the people of the state, and to
stimulate and increase metal and min
eral production and safety.

SLAVS THE OBJECT
OF SERBIAN HERE
John P. Grgurevich, Secretary
of the South Slavic National
Council, Here Investigating
Attitude of Countrymen.
John J. Grgurevich, secretary of the
South Slavic National council of
Washington, D. C and formerly a
special agent of the U. S. department
of justice, arrived in Bisbee yesterday
to confer with, advise and encourage
his countrymen to loyalty to the
United States. Mr. Grgurevich is a
Serbian.
"I wish to find out,' stated the Ser
bian visitor, "if my people were not
misled by false statement of alleged
labor leaders who are really foes of
labor. For a Serbian to bear the
slightest taint of disloyalty to the
i United States, the ally of Serbia, yes,
the hope of Serbia in this World War,
is a shameful thing.
"I am sure my people did not realize
what their action meant when they fol
lowed the I. W. W. agitators in that
strike to close the copper mines and
thereby cripple and hamper our gov
ernment. I understand that about
one hundred of them were deported to
Columbus. I have come here to try
to impress upon all the Slavic workers
the necessity- of not going on strike
during the war. It is disloyal to do
so. I am going to try to find out who
led them on this bad course and to use
the Bisbee case as an example to de
ter others from making this mistake.
"I shall probably go to Columbus
and see my misguided countrymen
there and learn from them all I can
of who started this agitation and the
why and wherefore of it. I am al
ready convinced that my countrymen
were satisfied with their wages. Some
thing else was behind their action. In
timidation for one thing.
Mr. Grgurevitch is a fine type of a
Serbian of the highest class.
Distinguished looking, intellectual,
intensely earnest and patriotic. He
served with Funston in the Fighting
Twentieth Kansas. He resigned from
the department of justice on a special
mission to help his people. He is
very proud of the bravery and endur
ance of the Serbian soldiers in the
' World War. He declares that thirty
to forty thousand Austrian and Hun-
'garian Slavs went over to the allies
and are with them heart and soul
: against the Central powers.
i He is a most interesting talker and
in close touch with world events, past
'.and present. He will travel all
through the west conferring with and
advising his people and gaining infor-
: mation about the present strike propa-
ganda from them. He appears to have
the best interests at heart and will
, doubtless do much good in this field of
i work.

ON MARRIED MEN
No Claim Of Exemption to Be
Allowed Unless Wife Is Li
able to Become a Public
Charge.
The District Exemption Board at
Tucson is still working on the claims
from Cochise county and has denied
a number of them. The following ac
tions were taken by the board in their
session of Wednesday according to the
Tucson Citizen:
The district exemption board for the
Second District today announced a
rule governing exemptions on the
ground of dependent wife and children.
The following resolution was unani
mously passed:
"It was unanimously decided that
for the purpose. of uniformitly that de
pendents should be governed accord
ing to the following rules insofar as
such classes only are concerned,
namely: A married man with no
children shall not be exempted unless
he clearly proves that his wife would
become a charge upon the community
or that she is an invalid requiring
personal care, attention and support
of the husband, and a married man
ith a child or children will be ex
empted unless it clearly appears that
his wife and children will be provided
for."
Only one claim for exemption on in
dustrial grounds was allowed among
a number considered by the district
board at the session today, and he was
merely given a three months' respite.
Ruling On Engineers.
A rule in reference to engineering
students at colleges was laid down
in the case of Warner Austin Shattuck
of Bisbee, a member of the class of
1918 in the Michigan College of Mines,
who asked to be allowed to complete
bis course. His claim for exemption
was disallowed.
Walter H. Triplett, engineer of
maintenance of way of the Nacozari
railroad, asked an exemption so that
he might get action on his application
for admission to the engineering corps.
He lives at Douglas. His claim was
disallowed.
The only claim allowed was that of
Lester C. Breniger, who has a ranch
at San Simon. He was given three
months to find a purchaser for his
ranch or get someone to run it.
The claim of Alexander J. Thomp
son, Jr., bean rancher and cattle rais
er of Dos Cabezas was disallowed..
' Other claims disallowed were:
Lonnie Mart Fralie, rancher;- Tomb
stone; Thomas Henry Short, rancher,
Pirtleville; W. A. Ingle, physically un
fit, Pearce.
600 Fail To Report.
A long list containing at least 600
names of those who failed to report
in Cochise county were automatically
drafted. They had been certified by
the local board. A number of these
men are in detention at Columbus, N.
M., being among those deported from
Bisbee on July 12. as I. W. W.'s.
What steps will be taken to apprehend
these men and place them in the army
will have to be determined by the de
partment of justice. Under the law.
they have lost the right to be exam
ined and to file exemption claim.
The board met at 11 o'clock this
morning at the office of John B.
Wright.
i New claims filed today were: Milo
; S. Frankvich, Bisbee, dependents, ap
peal; Charles Harvey Young, Thatch
er, dependents, appeal.
Many Graham County Appeals.
W. R. Chambers, county attorney
of Graham county, has appealed in
a large number of cases in which ex
emptions were allowed by. the local
board. Most of these were exemp
tions on account of dependent . rela
tives. In two cases where' men were
i discharged for being overweight
I Chambers alleges that he has every
j reason to believe that they will soon
I lose their surplus flesh. In another
i case where a man was discharged be
! cause' his teeth were had," Chambers
says he has every reason to believe
that he has a good set of molars.
Here are some new claims filed yes

board: James F. Cheadle, Tombstone,

GOVERDMENT TAKES '
E OF COAL
(Continued From Page One)
was suggested tonight-as a possibility
to prepare the government to handle
the stuation If the price-fixing plan
does not work out satisfactorily. The
last resort under the Saw is govern -
ment requisition of the output' of all
mines and the sale of it to the public.
The organization of an operating an
purchasing corporation would provide
all the machinery necessary to put the
commandeering provision of the law
Into operation.
Big Problem Ahead.
The biggest problem ahead of the
coal administration, as seen by officials
who have studied the .situation, is the
labor situation. The. general reduc
tion of prices in the bituminous fields
probably means that labor will be dis
appointed in many requests for wage !
increases based on the high prices
producers have been receiving for
their output. !
If there are strikes and production
is reduced the government can take
over and operate the mines but it has
not power to compel labor to work.
Officials of the government and labor
representatives are conducting nego-
tiations over this probleni. Such op
erators have declared it will be im
possible for them to grant wage in-,
creases under the new scale of prices
and throughout the middle west and
in other parts of the country general
coal mine strikes are pending.
Early extension of government con
trol to fuel oils was predicted tonight
by officials. Power to fix rrices for
oils and
id to govern their distribution,
and sale is given to the president in "- " I

NEW YORK FINANCIAL.
(By Review Leased Wire.)
NEW YORK, August 23. Latest as
pects of the government's price fixing
program were assigned as the reason
lor' the further weakness of today's
stock market Important shares re
corded additional declines of 2 to 6
points, but rallies in the final hour
materially reduced losses, some Issues
closing at net gains.
Trading was on the most extensive
scale of any session for several weeks,
aggregating 815,000 shares. Coalers,
steels, coppers, all the active equip
ments and numerous specialties were
most often the center of Irregular
bear drives.
The oil stocks, which are expected
to suffer from drastic price revision,
lost more ground than any other group
Texas Company making an extreme
loss of 13 points and Mexican Petrol
eum two. On the curb Standard Oil
issues registered gross declines of
three to 30 points.
United States Steel fell 2 points
to 118. H lowest price in about two
months, but closed at a net loss of
of a point Other steels made similar
recoveries and shippings, coppers and
motors relieved the greater part of
their losses with rails. (
Bonds were heavy, the Liberty issue
however, showing firmness at 99.92 to
99.96.
Total sales, par value,' $2,433,000.
United Slates bonds, old issues,
were unchanged on call.
GRAIN MARKETS.
CHICAGO, August 23. Abundant of
ferings caused corn prices to decline
early ' today, only to advance In a
greater degree later when notable
buying Induced shorts to hasten to
mvpr thfir lines. The close was
strong and near the top final figures
being V4 to cent higher with De
cember at 10914 to 199 and May at
106 to 107.
Wheat finished at 207, an advance of
one cent for the September option.
Last prices for oats were unchanged
to higher and provisions finished
from a shade lower to fifteen cents
higher.
Oats had a firm undertone which re
sponded when corn advanced. Country
offerings were light and cash figures
somewhat higher, which contributed
to the upturn.
Provisions fell off at the start due
to weakness of the hog market. A
lively demand, however, took the
prices to "higher levels. October lard
was conspicuous in the tradings , .
NEW; YORK, August 23. Yester
day's late weakness and Increasing ap
prehension over the government's
prospective price fixing program in
duced considerable liquidation in the
forenoon dealings with that conse
quence shares declined In most issues
excepting a few of the high grade rails
The so-called coaler shares were
again under much pressure, freer of
ferings in this quarter being inspired
under the governments attitude in re
gard to price fixing on coal. The
Bevere cut in the price of this com
modity has engendered a feeling that
the administration Is Intent on reduc
ing prices on the vital necessities to a
level much below that of the recent
past and this in conjunction with the
agitation in Washington to impose(
heavier taxation on corporate and In
dividual incomes, strengthens the as
sumption that big earnings on most
lines of industry are a thing of the
past and the net returns in the not dis
tant future are likely to be more in
keeping' with those of normal peace
times. Of course much depends on
the price to be established by the gov
ernment and the filed to which same
will apply but a survey of recent do
ings in this respect seem to be indi
cative of an application of sternness.

EVERYBODY SEES A
GHANGEJN FATHER
Suffered Over Twenty Years
And Spent Thousands Of
Dollars Trying To Get Well
Troubles Overcome.
"My father has suffered ' from
chronic stomach trouble for over 20
years and has paid Out thousands of
dollars on medicines and doctors,
said G. W. SJaydon, a well known Cobb
county farmer, who lives near Smyrna,
a short distance from out of Atlanta.
"We tried nearly everything trying
fb cure him, and he went off . to the
springs, thinking maybe the water
would help him, but it just looked like
nothing would reach his trouble. Then
he tried dieting and lived tn liquid
food until he almost starved but even
that failed to do any good and he
just kept going from bad to worse.
"I don't guess there ever was a case
as stubborn as his, and if there ever
was a confirmed dyspeptic he was one
of them, and I guess he would have
been yet if it hadn't been for this Tan
lac. "The first we heard of this medicine
was when my father saw an advertise
ment in the papers from parties he
knew In Tennessee, who were friends
of his, and he knew what they said
about it was the truth so he got it
right away and began taking it
' "Well, sir. It acted just like magic
and everybody notices the change in
father now why, he Is Just like a dif
ferent man and sits down to the table
and eats like a farm hand. Only yes
terday he ate pork and turnips for his
dinner, and ate so much we were act
ually afraid he was overdoing the
thing, but he laughed and said noth
ing hurt him nOw, and that he was
hungry and expected to eat and make
up for lost time.
"Now, when a medicine will do
things like that I think people ought
to know about it and I want to say
right now that I would not give one
bottle of Tanlac for all the other medi
cines and health resorts in the coun
try put together."

LABOR DAY
Bisbee is planning a Labor Day celebration that will
eclipse anything of the kind ever held in Arizona. The
day will be dedicated by this district to the hosts of
labor and the hosts of war. The workman and the sol
dier must hang together In this 'war or they will hang
separately. Modern war has made of Labor Day a pa
triotic occasion, for the workman, no less than the sol
dier must do his bit if the allies are to win.
In the old days of war one workshop could make
enough shells and cartridges to last a regiment a year.
Today a workshop cannot make enough ammunition in
a week to last a regiment a minute.
Uncle Sam is mobilizing more than a million men for
war and another million for the workshop and another
million for the fields and farms.
Hence Labor Day has come to be another Fourth
of July. ,
The decision to make it a notable day in this dis
trict was an inspiration. Who should not honor labor,
if this district, with its six or seven thousand workmen,
does not do so? We have driven the idlers and the drones
and the agitators and the foes of labor away. Industry
and labor and fairplay walk hand in hand here. The flag
of our country, soon to be torn by Prussian shells, floats
over all of us. And so, with civic pride and patriotic
zeal, we will all join in a grand celebration September 3.
With us at that time as honored guests will be the
Warren district quota of the drafted army of the Union.
These men have been called from peace to war. We
wish to make their last day in the valley a good day.
We wish to make them happy and proud, and by this
very act, make ourselves happy and proud. With all our
heart and soul, we wish to call out to them in one voice:
God Speed!
Boy, page Mr. Hoover! Tis the comsumer speaking.
Same old prices for sugar and flour and butter and meat
and eggs and coal and lumber and paper and gasoline
and leather still prevail. Page Hoover! And keep on
paging him until he gets this message and sends an an
swer that will chart the summit of this rocky hilL
America's answer to the pope was to tune the string
of war preparation a notch higher; England's answer was
another fierce offensive in Belgium; France's answer was
a mighty smash at Verdun; Italy's answer was a-tremen-
dous drive on the Izonso; Russia's answer was .
And Germany, the fierce one, the proud one, the irre
sistible one, her answer was to burn the great St. Quen
tin cathedral. How characteristic was each answer.
The Douglas Dispatch 'wants Gov. Campbell to issue
a special commission to Sheriff Harry Wheeler as an offi
cer n the National Guard, so that his ambition to enter
the army may be fulfilled. The Miami Silver Belt goes
the Dispatch one better by printing an open letter from
a subscriber who wants to run the great little sheriff for
governor. Our sheriff's tame is not of the fleeting va
riety, rather, it grows stronger as the days go by and the
people generally come to calmly consider bis character
and his courage in the trying days of the first half of July.
Senator Gore of Oklahoma is now trying to explain
the cause of the anti-draft riots in his home state, but
his explanations are far irom the mark. Their real cause
was his treasonable speeches in congress. His poor dupes
took him seriously and shed their blood in the highway
and went to jail. His state's good name is marred by a
blemish. But the senator himself, the man who is most
guilty, suffers nothing, unless it be the pangs of con
science. The agitator, the orator and the arch-traitor,
their methods are all the same; the Incite strikes, dis
orders and rebellions but take no active part in them.
Their dupes receive the blows in the field and on the
street and endure the hardships and suffer the punish
ment. But the leaders move on to new fields in the same
6tyle and ease and luxury as before.
LET IO BUSINE8S THRIVE
Los Angeles Times
The slackers and pacifists, the Stones and Works
and Reeds and Vardamans and O'Connells and I.W.W.
leaders and soap-box orators are making the air fetid with
their denunciations of President Wilson for what they
call his "surrender to big business."
All this because President Wilson has publicly de
manded "a just price for everything the government buye.
a price which will sustain the industries' concerned In a
high state of efficiency, provide a living for those who
conduct them, enable them to pay good wages and make
possible the expansions of their enterprises whic hwill
from time to time, become necessary as the stupendous
undertaking of this great war develops."
Why not? War has been forced upon us by the Ho-
henzollerns. We have made a war loan of three billion
dollars to the Allies and must, in our own defense, loan
them as much more, besides expending an equal sum
preparing for and conducting our own defense.
This vast expenditure for war purposes necessitates
the levying of war taxes which must be paid mainly by
the business men of the land. They must be paid out of
the profits of their business, and with no war profits
there will be no war taxes. Senator Lodge wisely said:
"Ton are not going to get the money to run this war if
you are going to kill business. You cannot raise taxes
unless yon have something to tax. Let private business
make all It can and then tax it."
.THEY'LL SEE FOUR ACE8 ON THE SHOWDOWN..
(From the Berlin Vossische Zeitung)
Don't let us be bluffed. Time and again throughout
the war our enemies have attempted, through bluff of
some kind or other, to depress the spirits of our people
here at home, when they discovered the Impossibility of
shattering the strength and confidence of our heroes in
the trenches. Every time the Allies have suffered a de
feat and were panting for breath they opened their
mouths twice as wide and Invented a new bluff.
Sometimes they resorted to sheer lies and slander;
at other times some new sort of bogy would be conjured
up for our terror. The very latest bluff is British and
French news about the impending appearance of Amer
ican troops. After having filtered through the press of
Scandinavia, Switzerland and Holland, the "news" has
even been smuggled into German newspapers. The only
incomprehensible thing is that it is published without
comment, and even taken seriously!
Thus we read, for instance, that American medical
units have arrived in Bordeaux, and that by autumn 123.
000 troops, or five American divisions, are to be dis
patched to Europe. A few days later we are informed
that General Pershing has reached France with 9,000 men
for training purposes, and now comes Swiss news, "via
Scandinavia, that the arrival of 70,000 Americans is im
minent! Now, even the Americans aren't quite such
hustlers as all this. So keep your head, German Michael,
and dont be bluffed!

Brief State Notes
J. B. Lyman, architect of the mining '
building of the University of Arizona,
has been selected as consulting archi
tect for the state on all work. His
first important work probably will be
in counection with the addition to the
state capital to be built at Phoenix.
Andy Guren, a Glbe man, expects
to leave for Washington within the
next, few weeks with a device which
he believes will revolutionize modern
warfare. All that is known regarding
the weapon is that it involves a prin
ciple of electricity which the inventor
claims is very powerful

Instead of meeting in November the

There have, been about 300 slackers

Jerome Issues Reported On
It was not alone with the submarine that Germany
violated the freedom of the seas, her mines have been
sown in free waters as far as her keels above and be
low the surface could reach. And they are in more utter
and brutal disregard of neutral rights and lives and prop
erty than even the submarine, if such a thing be possible.
At the beginning of the war England wanted to restrict
mines to shore waters and bar unanchored mines alto
gether. But not Germany. Her policy of ruthlessness
was made apparent early by the sowing of these terrible
seeds broadcast upon the seas long before she became
engaged in piracy via the submarine. The nation that
places unanchored mines in the high seas is like unto
the man who plants death traps in the public highways.
France is calling upon Japan for troops to man the
battered and broken Russian battle line. England is call
ing upon her for warships. The United States is calling
upon her for transports. And the wily Jap, the most
subtle and mysterious and capable of all the Orientals,
is saying much and doing but little. The Japanese mis
sion in this country at Ihis time has powers extraordinary.
It can grant all three of these pressing demands from its
allies. But there will be a price. The Japanese face is a
mask; the Japanese words of praise and compliment are
a foil. Who can read the mind of the Nipponese? . But
be sure of this, the importance of the visit of this Japa
nese mission is ten times greater than that of any of the
many and much heralded missions that have preceded
it since this country aai entered the war.
