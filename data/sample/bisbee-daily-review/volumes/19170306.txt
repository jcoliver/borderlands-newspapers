Capitol, Brilliant ana Pompous
Sees Wilson Take Office Again,
Insisting Upon Armed Neutrality
. , "' (By Review Leased Wire)
WASHINGTON, March 5. Woodrow Wilson, with
war and America poised on its verge, consecrated his second inauguration as president of the
United States today with! a last, message of hope for peace.
Standing in the shadows of the nation's capitol with his face turned toward the east
ern war-seared skies, the President renewed his oath of allegiance to the constitution, praying
to God that he might be given wisdom and prudence to do his duty in the true spirit of the
American people.
United States Must Stand Firm.
i While trumpets blared
pictured the deep wrongs the United States had patiently borne in the conflict of other peo
ples without wishing to wrong or injure in return. Asserting that the tragedies of another
continent had removed provincialism and made Americans
. , , , . "ii.
the principles ot this republic
voiced a determination that America, standing, hrm in armed neutrality must demon
strate her claim to "a minimum of right and freedom of action," in world affairs.
Peculiar interest and signifi
cance in the light of his rebuke
last night to senators who pre
vented the passage of the
armed neutrality bill, were at
tached to the President's as
sertion on this point. Even
more interest arid concern
were aroused when he added:
Shall Not Shun War.
"We may even be drawn
on, by circumstances not by
our own purpose or desire, to
a more active assertion of our
rights aft we See them and a!
more immediate . association I
with the great struggle itself.
But nothing will alter our
thought or our purpose. We
desire neither conquest nor ad
vantage. We wish nothing
that can be had only at the
cost of another people. We
always have professed unsel
fish purposes and we covet the
opportunity to prove that our
professions are sincere.
Near Future Concerns Him
Making no attempt to review the
legislative record of the last four
years, the President said that this
was no time for retrospection. The
time was one to speak of thoughts
?nd purposes for the immediate fut
ure. To be indifferent to the Influ
ence of the war upon America, or in
dependent of it. he said, was impossi
ble end he was firm in the conviction
that the part this country wished to
piny In the vital turmoil was the part
of those "who mean. to vindicate and
fortify peace." ,
Crowd Sings "America."
These were the dominant thoughts
of the President as he addressed the
cheering multitude in the broad plaza
of the capital grounds. In the assem
blage before him American citizens of
all nations had sung "America" with
a mighty voice while waiting for his
appearance on the inaugural stand.
And In the procession which followed
him to the White House and passed
through, a "composite and cosmopolit
an people" gave graphic evidence of
loyalty and patriotism.
Once-Aliens Cheer Him
"We are American citizens," flared
from banners borne by once-alien
hands, was the stirring message blaz
ing from a standard waving over the
heads of new American citizens from
Poland. Men of many foreign ances
tries held to the breeze ns they
marched past the chief executive oth
er insignia of patriotic Americanism,
and the words "America First" em
blazoned on ' countless streamers
nronsed the throngs along Washing
ton's broad thoroughfares to continu
al outbursts of patriotic fervor.
Mrs. Wilson Prominent
Sharing the plaudits with the Presi
dent was Mrs. Wilson, who accompan
ied him to the capitol, stood by his
side at the inai'gural stand as Chief
Justice White administered the oath
of office, and joined with him in ac
knowledging the tribute and acclaim

army and navy and members of the
cabinet. Then the sergeant at arms
of the senate heralded the approach
of the "President of the United

The spectacular fight during the
closing hours of congress still was a

A deterrination to rrm the menb

found was generally apparent.
The President has placed squarely
tefore the senate the responsibility
for changing its rules during the spe
cial session begun today so that fili
bustering by a small group ot sena
tors cannot prevent action by con
gress. In the meanwhile he Is pre
paring to take such steps as he can
to meet the crisis and defend Ameri

While the arming of merchantmen
is the step most considered, (it Is
pointed out that the Ppi-sidem has the
right to convoy American vessels.
This course has been opposed by the
navy department, however, principal
ly for strategical reasons.
Another step suggested is that the
shipping board take over American
merchantmen, arm them as naval aux
iliaries and send them abroad.
The President has been inclined to
believe that certain old statutes still
in force might prevent him from fur
nishing guns to merchantmen, but
some of his advisors hold that ' a
broader and truer interpretation ot
these laws will show that they have
no application to the present situa

WANTS UMTT ON DEBATE
President's Demand for Change of Rules Following Failure
of His Armed Neutrality Bill By Handful of Senators,
Threatens Worse Division in Senate Public Opinion,
However, Believed Supporting President
(By Review Leased Wire)
WASHINGTON, March 5 With
President Wilson's demand for a
change in senate rules to make
possible in the future such a
filibuster as the one by which a
handful of members defeated the
armed neutrality bill fresh in their
minds, senate Democrats will
caucus tomorrow on a program for
the special session.
The session, called primarily to
pass upon appointments to otiice. be
gan formally today and will get down
to business tomorrow.
Senator Owen, who has been the
chief proponent of a limited debate
rule for many years. Is prepared to
bring the subject of cloture before the
caucus and Zi senators, most of them
Democrats, have signed an agreement
to support the rule he proposes.
Senate Badly Split.
If the caucus decides to stan l be
hind this proposal and make i- the
chief issue of the session, the tenate
may spend the summer In Washington
instead of disposing of its work in a
few days as ' usual. Many senators
who have participated in various such
fights in the past believe it would be
more difficult to get the senate to
agree t a limited debate rule than
it would be to get a declaration of
war against Germany or to pass the
armed neutrality bill that died yester
day because the rules say a senator
cannot be taken from the Hour when
he wishes to keep on talking.
G. O. P. Oppose It
There has been no caucus among
opponents of the cloture but Republi-f
cans in the cloak rooms today pre
: and openly declared that there would
which his statement denouncing the
present rules is expected to arouse.
Never before in tbt history of the
many suggestions that have been made
for such a change has a President
openly aligned himself in Its favor.
nor has public attention generally
been called to what he considers a'
..v.. p. J
fault in its method of procedure. The
optimistic chiimnions of cloture think
it would be difficult to keep public in
terest centered on such a question.
A majority can force open debate but
to u'j so would offer opportunity for j
public discussion of the present situa
tion and possibly strengthen the Eu
ropean opinion that congress is divid
ed In supporting the President in his
international palicy.
Denounces Are Bitter.
The Republicans, side from any per
sonal views they may have about the
President's statements and its intent
to force a change in the procedure of
the legislative branch, will oppose the
proposed rule just as minorities al
ways opposed it because unlimited
debate is one of their most potent
weapons. The Progressive Republi
cans wbo participated in the killing
of the armed neutrality bill are un
derstood to be exceedingly bitter over
the President's statement denouncing
bis men were drowning, amoug them
a second boat with four men. In this
boat was the wireless operator, thus
preventing the cutter from getting
any more news from the stranded
ship.
This boat had a terrible fight with
the waves and one of the seamen, a
negro, was thrown oterboard. Fear
ing that if he were pulled in the boat
would overturn, his comrades lashed
him to the side of the boat and re
turned to the shore. The captain or-
dered a third boat out. It carried a
mess boy of 37. and a negro seaman.
The sea plug came out and the boat
sank. William Hogarth, the mess boy
managed to get ashore; the negro was
drowned. F.ery bit of clothing was
torn from the boy by tbe waves. He
remained naked in hut all night
Late tonight none of the bodies bad

Some senators do not reeard a fiuht

is no one in the senate who actually

or not the President puts the power

MANY CASES OF
RHEUMATISM NOW
Says We Must Keep Feet Dry,
Avoid Exposure and
Eat Less Meat
Stay off the damp ground, avoid ex
posure, keep feet dry, eat less meat,
drink lots of water and above all take
a spoonful of salts occasionally to
keep down uric acid.
Rheumatism is caused by poisonous
toxin, called uric acid, which is gen
etated in the bowels and absorbed in
to the blood. It is the function of the
kidneys to filter this acid from the
blood and cast it out in the urine. The
pores of the skin are also a means of
freeing the blood of this impurity. In
damp and chilly, cold weather, the
skin pores are closed, thus forting
the kidneys to do double work, they
become weak and sluggish and fail to
eliminate this uric acid which keeps
ct'Uii:ulatii!y mid circulating through
the system, eventually settling in the
oints and muscles, causing stiffness,
soreness and pain called rheumatism.
At the first twinge of rheumatism
,vt from any pharmacy about four
ounces of Jad Salts; put a tablespoon
ul in a gla:;s of water and drink be
ore breakfast each morning for a
.'eek. This is said to eliminate uric
cid by stimulating the kidneys to
ormal action, thus ridding the blood
f these impurities.
Jad Sails, is inexpensive, harmless
nd is made from the acid of grapes
nd lemon juice, combined with lithia
r.d is used with excellent results by
'ousands of folks Who are subject to
heumatism. Here you have a pleas
nt, effervescent litliia-water drink
-'iirh overcomes uric acid and is ben
'icial to your kidneys, as well.

NEGRO ATTEMPTS TO
SHOOT BOSS; NABBED
DOUGLAS, Murrli-5. After twice
attempting to kill X7 A. Blankenship,
his employer. Robert Scott, a negro,
was overpowered y jtenlay afternoon
at the Star ' Livery stabie, corner
Twelfth street and G avenue. This
n.'jrning in Justice Dunlap's court he
waived preliminary hearing and wes
held to the superior court with bail
at $500. which he was untble to make.
He will be taken to Tombstone to
answer to the charge of aggravated
assault.
According to reports of the affair
Scott was intoxicated and when his
employer tried to get him to go t'j bed.
he insulted Mr. Ulankenship, who
promptly knocked him down. The
negro went away and returned in a
few moments with a gun, aimed it at
Blankenship, who grappled with him
and forced his arm upward, the shot
going high in the air. Scott was dis
armed and again allowed to go, but
instead of leaving went upstuir aud
in a few momenta again fired at
Ulankenship. This time when he was

ficers aud taken to jail.

Millions of men and women today
know that it is needless to have dys

If youh sl'jmach doesn't take care

a help, remember the quickest, surest,
most harmless relief is Pape's Diapep

The 500,000 marks referred to in the
foregoing dispatch was collected in
the United States under the patronage
of a committee headed by James W.
Gerard, then ambassador to Germany.
A dispatch from Berlin March 2 said
the committee to which the money
had been turned 'over by Mr. Gerard
on the even of the ambassador's de
parture from Berlin, had decided to
deposit it in a local bank, subject to
the disposition of Mr. Gerard. It was
added that the committee had decided
not to make the distribution among
war widows and ornhans as was ori

Ignorance.
Three Bisbee men, several nights ago, were sitting at I
a local lunch-counter and. very naturally, the all-absorbing
topic of conversation arose. The question discussed
was whether or not the United States should protect
itself against war. All of the men were young, no one
being over thirty. One appeared to be of Irish descent,
while the other two were average Americans.
"I think it is a shame for the United States to be
butting into this row, just V pull chestnuts out of the
fire", declared he of Irish descent. "England is a hog and
is using this country for its own purposes. Just look
what Great Britain did with the Irish. Why she even
sent 50,000 Irishmen into the front ranks on the Western
front for gun fodder when the war first started".
"I can't see the United States getting sore at Mexico",
declared one of tl.e average Americans. "Mexico has a
right to resent this country's activities. Why, didn't we
steal a lot of ber territory in the war of 1S48?"
Just at this point the third young fellow remembered
having read somewhere, some time, something about the
United States buying a parcel of land from Mexico. The
second American denied the allegation and ended his re
marks by saying that "Villa or Carranza, either one,
could be bought by a 'small piece of change'."
This is merely a small part of the conversation. It was
highly interesting and instructive if the acme of ignor
ance can be instructive. If the seeing or hearing of
something which is the result of the worst ignorance can
be called enlightening, then the whole community should
have heard.
The three young men appeared to be average. Neither
one said "I seen' nor did either repeat 'I aint' too ofter.
All appeared as though they may have been acquainted
with school to some slight degree. They were the aver
age wage earning American youths, more bent cn spend
ing their daily return than on doing the necessary work
to obtain it. They were complainers, kickers and (judg
ing from some of the conversation) as unpatriotic a lot
as ever walked.
Ask the average European, particularly a German or a
Frenchman abcut his country. If he be a young man hit
ideas may have some of the freshness of youth and its
peculiar viewpoint, but one may rest assured that his
own country's history be fairly authentic; that hi
points will be well taken; that lie has informed himself
" or has been informed and lastly, that he makes few rath
assertions about subjects. which he knows little about.
Take the young Irishman, first cited, as a fine example
' of what should not be true. Undoubtedly, he has had
has chance for, at least, a common school education. He
V does not look as though he had been weighed down by
" J any great work when a youngster. In all probability he
" had preferred the streets to the school.
J But look at his present condition, while he Js con-,-,
demning England and declaring that Great Britain is
-. using this nation. He is earning about $6 a day, more
money than be ever received before. Yet he maintains
that Germany is being given the worst of the bargain by
; : America. We wonder how long he, or anyone else in this
great camp of ours, would be getting $S or any other
; price for their labor had 1'rosident Wilson and the otlicr
leaders of American thought bowed to an iusistant ma
jority, made up of Hyphens and malcontents. Unlike
I'ryau, most Americans' mouths are liabilities not assets.
; They have to work for a living.
It does seein strange, however, that with all of our
j
' much vaunted learning, our great school systems, our
i progress in every line, we should find the younger genera
tion so poorly advised on the history of so young a na
tion as the United States. To say that it is indeed a
crying shame is voicing a bromidic similie. In argument
with a Frenchman or a German our average young men
arc lost. They can tell who Jlonus Wagner is and per
haps what Ty Cobb batted I ist season, but when it conn s
to telling of the causes that led up to the Mexican war
and the liual settlement, these !ioy .-Mow as much dis
position for information as a Salt Kiver Vulky hug would
for Juniper Flats grazing.
Surely the nation and especially its younger generation
mjcd.i ihy,, hypvrdcniiic shot, under its skin. -suinetli'ng to
awaken a better understanding of w.Vat America-is and
what it menus.
The Case of China.
So long has the "heathen Chinee" been a matter of
st in these United States, with no definite knowledge
.. the subject, that the possibility of that nation's entry
..uo the war on the side of the Allied countries is con
.Mdered more or less as a matter of mirth. Nothing can
be further from the truth.
We Americans claim to be very metropolitan in our
views and in our knowledge of American and world af
ilrs. The stranger within our gates and notably the
in: man has always been the object of much curiosity.
n California, where the Chinese are more thickly settled
than in any other part of the country, their country is re
arded as a defunct affair incapable of being made one
.f the greatest nations in the world.
Consequently when China considers the advisability of
eatering the conflict of Europe, something must be stir
ring in the minds of the advanced thinkers in the Celes
al republic which is worth observing. China may be on
he threshold of such a revival as came over Japan and
changed that country from an unknown to one of the big
.actors in the world's business and thought.
China is the greatest natural, untouched storehouse in
i ne world' today. Though hardy explorers have pene
trated into its most remote quarters, its resources have
been hardly scratched. Owing to the lack of railroads in
China and other feasible means of communication and
transportation and also, of the country's natural suspic
ion of the stranger, its progress in world affairs has been
retarded to the point where it is the one virgin nation, in
;his respect, in the world.
After being locked up in itself for five thousand years,
China has had great difficulty in getting accustomed to
commerce and intercourse with t'ie world, in general.
During the past few decades, however, many of its young
er men have studied in Europe and the United States
and the desire to be something in the world is slowly,
but surely, filtering through from the top to the bottom
of Chinese life.
Potentially, China is great. Actually, China is an un
known quantity and it would be a difficult matter to de
termine just wha she could do to aid the Entente na
tions. China has a population of 421,000,000 in an area of
4.287,000 square miles. The peace strength of her army
is 400.000, and her reserves 300,000. making available for
war 700,000 men. The total available men is 63,430,000,
more than any other nation in the world, and twice and
three times as many as in many of 'the European coun
tries. Wihat could not China do if any considerable por
tion of these men could be trained as soldiers? What
effect would a million Chinese soldiers have on either
frcnt, officered by Europeans or by-Japanese?
From a commercial standpoint China is nearly as hack
ward as in every other matter. According to the bureau
of foreign and domestic reports, for the year 1914. Chinese
imports amounted to $348,187,350. Her exports in the
same period were $215,750,545. What a wonderful chance
for expansion. China's finances are in no too good a con
dition. Her revenue, in 1915, was approximately $100,
000.000, while in 1913 her debt amounted to over $969,
000,000. With her latent resources, including material and men.
China might be expected, if given time to prepare, to aid
he Allies to a wonderful extent. It would not appear,
however, that, at once, she could be cf much material
aid except morally. A declaration of war on her part
vould strengthen the Allies position before the world.
In the consideration of the question, however, there is
one element missing. That is Japan. Japan is in the
position of the small boy leading a giant and untutored
,lind man by the nose. Will Japan assent to China's go
ing into the war? What will she have to say about the
matter? Is the little Niponese empire passive, against or
for? I'rohably these questions will be answered before
long by the trend of events both at home and abroad.

The Potatocrats.
With the harassed public busy looking for the causes
or causers of the high cost of foodstuffs, popular wrat l
is at last being turned against the farmers. The potato
situation seems to give some reason for accusing the pro
ducers of conspiring against the consumers.
An economic expert estimates that four-fifths of the
present potato supply in the United States is in the
hands, not of the speculators or middlemen, hut of the
fanners. 'And there is no disposition on the part of the
farmers themselves to deny that they are holding onto
their crop for all they cuu get out of it.
Buyers from Cleveland and Cincinnati, going through
the best potato-raising section of Ohio, report that the
farmers refuse to sell. They say they expect to get at
IcHSt $4 a bushel for their crop, ajid $G a bushel or more
f:r seed jiutatue. The same story comes from other
states of the middle west.
In Aroostook County, Me., "the mother of potatoes",
the farmers are openly rejoicing in the happy turn of
fortune that has given them power to exploit the consum
ing public. Oue cf them, in a letter to a Boston news
papei, remarks:
"The cities are rather sore on us because we are get
ting ten times as much for potatoes as it costs to raise
them. But everybody's doing it and Aroostook is cer
tainly making up for the lean years."
Perhaps the farmers can't be lilaiu-.-d for charging all
tlie traffic will bear at a time when, as the Aroostook po
tatoiTBt truly sajs, "everybody's doing i'." But let them
take are!
Heretofore M'- farmer has always had the fricndlv
sympathy of the general juitilic. It may. Ik1 granted thai
he has the same right to gouge the consumers that city
food manipulators have. F.iit let him not brag of his pow
er and Haunt his int.nooisti: pains too epeiily, lest pub
lic sympathy turn to envy and cnniiiy. The frmT an J

LOWEST PRICE CLOSE-IN STOCK IN THE JEROME DISTRICT.

These shares are full paid, non-assessable, and are transferable and

Recent developments in the Jerome District make it clear that
THIRTY CENTS is far too low an opening price, but we make it to
keep faith with many investors who have been waiting for the first
offer of TREASURY stock.

shipping stage, with a great "steam shovel" surface deposit, running
4'c to 6Vi copper, as well as having the ore in the shaft.
James W. Hubbard, just resigned as superintendent of Dundee-Arizona,
and now a Director and superintendent of Great Verde Extension, be
lieves he will find the ore in this property much nearer the surface
than he. did in Dundee-Arizona.
Mr. Huobard developed the Dundee Arizona, has been for twelve years
an operating authority in the Jerome District, and his unsupported
opinion in itself is' worthy of the highest consideration.
This opinion, however, is agreed in by other authorities, who have had

said to have $300,000 cash in the Treasury, and Jerome-Superior, which
is similarly well financed.
A new strike by any of these is certain to make a sharp advance in all
Jerome stocks, particularly Great Verde Extension, both because of its
location and that it is the lowert priced close-in stock in Jerome.

The Man from
Ray Says: (5)
"A SHOEMAKER WHO MADE A NATIONAL
NAME FOR HIMSELF AND WHOSE FACE IS
WELL KNOWN WHEREVER ENGLISH IS SPOKEN,
ATTRIBUTED HIS SUCCESS TO "PEGGING
AWAY.'"
Because Fred E. Young and his large force of men have
been consistently "pegging away" on the property, de
velopment work has reached the point where
WE PREDICT A STRIKE ON
ARIZONA RAY COPPER
at an early date on Copper Zone No. 7, where Mr. Young has
always contended that the same rich ore body, which has
been exposed on the Ray Consolidated, would be struck.
In the weekly report, which has just been received from Mr.
A. MacDonald, foreman in charge of operations, we have the
most interesting and encouraging information that has been
received from the ARIZONA RAY property, to date.' In this
report Mr. MacDonald says:
During the week ending February 23rd, we lowered hole on
Copper Zone No. 4. 110 feet. Drilling has been a little slower
here during this preiod because we have been drilling in the
conglomerate. The conglomerate came in at a depth of 300
feet and is still with us at depth of 450. This hole is in ex
cellent shape and we will be able to carry down the 10 inch '
size for 500 feet.
"On Copper Zone No. 7 Hole, the formation. Granite
Porphyry, is softening, up-caving slightly. I believe
we are approaching the Fractured Zone that Outcrops
on and carries ore on the surface above us. The next
100 feet in this hole should cut both the Fractured Zone
above mentioned and the Calumet Fault. The block
lying between these two fractures should carry copper
values of commercial grade."
Under the circumstances
WHERE CAN YOU EQUAL THIS SPECIAL
OFFER.
SPECIAL OFFER
We will accept subscriptions either for cash or on Twelve-Payment
Plan in 1000 share lots for A-izona Ray, REGULAR STOCK (NOT
POOL RIGHTS) at 12c per share providing the holder will-sign an
agreement not to dispose of or transfer his stock for sixty days
from date. Thus, stock purchased under this offer, which holds
good only until our present allotment is exhausted, will be released
after sixty days. This should not be confused in anyway with Pool
Rights, the stock held under which, is pooled for an indefinite
period.
NOT pool rights, but FREE STOCK, listed on the various exchanges
and traded in on the Curbs.
THE TIME TO BUY IS JUST BEFORE
NOT JUST AFTER THE STRIKE:
The man who makes the big profits in mining stocks is the man who
buys BEFORE the strike. Ability to look ahead is probably more
important in the mining Industry then in any ether branch of com
mercial life. ARIZONA RAY COPPER, at present prices, offers an
exceptional speculative opportunity, because there is no question about
what the stock will do on the various exchanges, if the Calumet vein is
struck. It will go up with a rush then it wiH be too late to realize tre
profits that are to be made if the stock is purchased NOW at the low
price. The thing to do is to follow the lead of the great number of
practical mining men of Arizona who have invested in this most prom
ising Junior, and buy ARIZONA RAY NOW. NEXT WEEK MAY BE
TOO LATE, Because
OUR LAST OFFERING OF
ARIZONA RAY COPPER
with the special preposition that we are making, is bringing orders
in large volume, many of them from stockholders of record who bought
at a higher price and are taking advantage of this opportunity to aver
age their holdings. Frankly, YOUR TIME IS LIMITED, and we strong
ly advise that you send us your orders NOW, either for immediate de
livery at the market, with a minimum of 15 cents, or under our SPE- '
CIAL OFFERING.

QUICK RELIEF FROM
CONSTIPATION
Get Dr. Edwards' Olive Tablets
That is the joyful cry of thousands
since Dr. Edwards produced Olive Tab
lets, the substitute for calomel.
Dr. Edwards, a practicing physician
for 17 years and calomel's old-time en
emy, discovered the formula for Olive
Tablets while treating patients for
chronic constipation and torpid livers.
Dr. Edwards' Olive Tablets do not
contain calomel, but a healing, sooth
ing vegetable laxative.
No griping is the "keynote" of these
little sujiar-coated, olive-colored tablets.
They cause the bowels and liver to act
normally. They never force tliem to
unnatural action.
If you have a "dark brown mouth"
now and then a bad breath a dull,
tired feeling sick headache torpid
liver and are constipated, you'll find
quick, sure and only pleasant results
from one or two little Dr. Edwards'
Olive Tablets at bedtime.
Thousands take one or two every
night just to keep right. Try them.

Sir Herbert Eeerbchm Tree:
Leading Man in Triangle;
Feature "The Old Folks et
Home." !
j One of England's greatest present
day actors and one jf Aaseiicas most
successful present clay authors co-
.ribute their joint efforts toward the
making of "The Old Folks at Homo,'
Triangle drama to be seen at the
Orphcum theatre aain tonight
Sir Herbert Beerholm Tree's first
screen appearance was in "Macbeth,"
which wa3 filmed at the Triangle
fine Arts studio in California several
months aso. Fallowing this perform
ance, which has been termed "by many
critics the finest characterization of a
Shapespearean part yet seen on the
screen. Sir Herbert returned to New
York, where he appeared at the New
Amsterdam theatre in a number of
plays from his repertoire. j
But again the call of the film came
through the Triangle aiid again Tree '
journeyed to Los Angeles. Much time
had been consumed in the selection o'
a vehicle for his talents and the choice
had finally fallen 'on "The Old Folks
fit Hniip " u ctnrr written hv PuTprt
Hughes, noted as a writer or short
'stories and novels, ami also as a play
wright, the ev! reincly successful farce
i "F::ruse Me" being a product of his
' pen. i
The choice was well made, for the
part of John Coburn, rugged and
i stern, a father of the old school, who
needs t'j see his son in direct peril in
order to realize his real duty to the
boy, is one remarkably adapted ti
both the personality and art of the
veteran actor.
The theme of the play is parental
love, and the story gives Tree and the
leading members' of his supporting
.-ast opportunities for excellent emo
) tional w'ork. The cast includes .Tose
jphinc Crowell as Mrs. Coburn, Elmei
i Clifton as the son, Mildred Harris as
I the latter's sweetheart and Lucille
! Your.ge in a siren role. Chester WHh-
ey directed the play.

MUNICIPAL BAR AT
AGUA PRIETA SUNDAY
Thirsty Americans Lubricate
Anatomies with "Good ol
Bsd" at $1 a Bottle.
DOUGLAS, March 5. Beer at fl ft
pint was the chief feature tf the fiesta
held yesterday at Agua Prieta. in the
new fiscal agency building to celebrate
its completion and raise funds for tne
new city hall. For this purpose $10,000
in gold is to be raised, it is said, and
Judging from the stories brought back
by Americanos who obtained their
first experience at a kermess a la Mex
icana, the Agua Prietans must have
raised nearly that much yesterday.
Thirsty Americans went across the
line with glowing hopes of soothing
,'jng-perched throats with floods of
the amber beverage, but Ihese fond
longings in many instances were
spoiled because of a mere matter of
cost. The price was 50 cents to get
to where the beer was and 1 for the
smallest bottle when you got there.
.Some of the Americans gave up right
there and returned to American soil
dlled with imprecations for Venusti
ano Carranza and Pancho Villa. Oth
ers simply said, "We're stung; lets
;pend while it lasts, anyh'jw."

"How she has faded!, or "Hasn't she

husband sees it. She realizes it her
self with a pang. Often she knows the
reason,so"e female derangement has
fastened itself upon her and .makes it
almost impossible for her to d.ag

ble Comtound for more .than forty
years has been restoring women to
health and happiness. Try it!
