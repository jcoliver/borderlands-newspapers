DOUGLAS. Aug. 8. Preliminary
hearings In the Bisbee deportation
cases were this morning continued in
Justice V. C. Jack' court until Mon
day, after the hearings of Burrell
Slaughter, Oscar Wager and Chris
Marshall, of Bisbee, had been com
pleted.'
Thirty-nine of the hearings In the
group of 51 cases that have occupied
the court for the last three weeks
have now been completed and the
county attorney stated this morning
that he hoped to complete the re
mainder of cases In the group. If pos

witness in each case for the state,

The hearings r this morning were
without sensational testimony, and all
three cases were completed in less
than one hour.
Mrs. McKay Witness Again.
Mrs. Rosa McKay, member of the
state legislature from Gila county, one
of the state's contingent of witnesses
from Globe, was first called to the
stand in the hearing of Wager. Mrs.
McKay said she had seen Wager walk
ing toward a group of other armed
citizens, near the depot at Bisbee, on
t Via tv rrr In or rf V a rlnw rf f Vi a A arrr-
tations. She saw him do or sav noth-l
ing to anyone at that time, she said.
Mrs. McKay said on direct examlna
tion that she "thought" she had seen
Wager later In the day at the baseball
park at Warren. Questioned regard
ing this during cross-examination,
Mrs. McKay was not certain whether
or not she had seen the defendant
at Warren. She was asked if Wager
had done anything aW Warren to at
tract her particular attention and re
plied that if she had seen him there
she knew he was taking part In the
deportations. She did not answer di
rectly the question of counsel for the
defense, but insisted vigorously that,
whether or not she had seen Wager,
nothing would ever convince her but
what he was taking part in the de
portations 'lf"-she had seen him.
Witness Appears Seventeen Times.
J. F. Holman, appearing as a wit
ness for the state in his seventeenth
case, said that Wager appeared to be
acting as a "captain" of the armed
guards in front of the Bisbee post
office on the morning of the day of
the deportations. Later In the day,
said Holman. he saw Wager again
when the latter ordered a man who
was threatening Holman and another
deportee to "shut uji" and move on.
Holman told of. hearing Wager, a lit
tle later, ask a man who claimed to
have once beeji a soldier, to get out
of the line of deportees. The man re
fused to do so, said Holman. This
was the extent of his knowledge of
Wager's actions on that day, said Hol
man. Bert Perry said he saw Wager twice
on-the day of the deportations, the
first time when Wager, said the wit
ness, was on the way to the ball park

Note To Allies Says It Is

With 'Babies Starving'; Say
War Debt Unjustly Split Up
COPENHAGEN, Aug. 8 (By the As
sociated Press.) A summary of the
Austrian note presented to the allied
peace mission at St. Germain, France,
yesterday, has been received here
from Vienna. "If German-Austria ter
ritorial demands are fulfilled to the
minimum extent asked for in the ap-
pendix to the note," savs the sum
marv. "fiermnTi-AiietHa -m i-, -r

I dently and in Deace ln this territory.
I She expects the league of nations
will heaf her in her hour of distress
"On the other hand, German-Austria
still is firmly convinced that the econ
omic burdens Imposed upon her by
the peace treaty cannot really be car
ried out and that if they are not sub-
plenary powers regarding "the un
collapse.
"It will be impossible for the next
few months to deliver milking cows
and cattle, as German-Austria's chil
dren are perishing for lack of meat
and milk.
German-Austria must allow herself
to be placed under the entente pow
ers' financial control but she expects
the reparations commission will act
with the consideration demanded by
ner desperate position and grant the
necessary credit to obtain raw ma
terials and foodstuffs."
ine note urges amendment with a
view to investing a commission with
pleanary powers regarding "the un
just and unequal division of old Au
stria's debts among tfie states which
succeeded ILand the injustice of stinu-
lations regarding war loans.
it seems self-evident, . the note
continues, "that all states in what
was formerly Austria-Hungary should
divide the debts of the old monarchy.
Apart frdm the bank jiotes debts,
clauses in the peace treaty show a
burden of debt for German-Austria of
some forty billion marks. Thus two-
thirds of the entire debt of the Au
strian states, without the 'note debt,
is placed upon the shoulders of one
fifth of the former Donulation
--'The note proposes as in the case of
previous war debt, that all debts shall
be divided by the reparations commis
sion according to individual states to
them. A similar proposal is made re
garding Austro-Hungary bank notes
held abroad.
ine note concluded with a refer
ence to settling questions between
German-Austria and other states of
the former monarchy, declaring that
stipulations not capable of fulfillment
must be relieved and these Questions
regulated by the reparations commit
tee in order not to prolong the peace
negotiations.
"It would be of Indisputable value
for all parties," the note adds, "if the
members of the German-Austrian de
putation were heard and called upon
to give oral explanations before the
committees."
The note is accompanied by exten
sive proposals on territorial and

WILSON SCORES
TAKING; ASSERTS RATIFICATION OF
TBEATYWILL LOWER LIVING COST
President, In Address Before Joint Session of Congress
Says Present High Prices Not Justified; Urges Federal
Licensing of Corporations In Interstate Commerce and
Extension of Food Control Act to All Life's Necessities
WASHINGTON. Aug. 8. President
Wilson laid several specific proposals
iiore congress today for checking
the high cost of living, but at the same
time declared permanent results could
not be expected until a peace time
basis was fully restored bv ratiflm-
tion of the peace treaty.
High prices, the president told con
gress, were not justified by shortage
of supplies, either present or pros
pective, but were ' created in many
cases "artificially and deliberately"
by "vicious practices." Retailers, he
said, were responsible In large part
ior extortionate prices.
btriies, the president warned the
labor world, would only make matters
worse, and those who sought to em
ploy threats of coercion wrongly "pre
pared their own destruction."
Leaders of organized labor, the
president said, he was sure would
presently yield to second sober
thoughts.
Prices "Illegal and Criminal"
"Illegal" and "criminal" were the
words the president used in character
izing the methods by which some
present day prices have been brought
about
Present laws, he said, would be en
ergetically employed to the limit to
force out food hoards and meet the
situation bo far as possible, but to
supplement the existing statutes, he
specifically urged the following:
Licensing of all corporations en
gaged In interstate commerce
with spiciflc regulations designed
to secure competitive selling and
prevent "unconscionable profits"
in the method of marketing.
Extension of -the food control
act to peace times and the appli

hoarding to fuel, clothing and
other necessities of life as well

Laws requiring .that goods re

In concluding, the president mad
a plea for deliberate, intelligent ac

"United States.
"We and we almost alone." he said.
now hold the world steady. Upon
our steadfastness and self-possession
depend the affairs of nations every
where. It is in this supreme crisis
this , crisis for all mankind that
America must prove her mettle."
The president's speech, in part, is
as follows:
Would Make Control Permanent
"Let me urge In tne first place, that
the present food control act should
be extended both as (o period of time
during which it shall remain in op
eration, and as to the commodities to
which is shall apply. Us provisions
against hoarding should be made to
apply not only to food but also to
feedstuffs, to fuel, to clothing and to
many other commodities where un
doubtedly necessaries of life. As it
stands now It Is limited in operation
to the period of the war and becomes
inoperative upon formal nroclamation
of peace. But I should judge that It
was clearly within the executive pow
er of the congress to make similar
permanent provisions and regulations
with regard to all goods destined for
interstate commerce and to exclude
them from interstate shipment if the
requirements of the law are not com
plied with.
"Some such regulation Is impera
tively necessary or the abuses that
have grown up in the manipulation of
prices by the withholding of food
stuffs, and other necessaries of life,
cannot be effectively prevented. There
can be no doubt of either the neces-
sity or the legality of such a measure.
May I not call attention to the fact

The governor then directed the ad

excess of 13,000. With the agreement

American's interests in the southern
republic.
(Continued From Page One)
also, that although the present act
prohibits profiteering, the prohibition
is accompanied by no penalty. It is
clearly the intention that a penalty
should be provided which will be dis
suasive. Urges Cold Storage Regulation
. "To the same end, I earnestly rec
ommend, In the second place, that the
congress pass a law regulating cold
storage as it is regulated, for example,
by the laws of the state of New Jer
sey, which limit the time during
which goods may be kept in storage,
prescribe the methods of disposing of
them if kept beyond the permitted
period, aud require that goods re
leased from storage shall in all cases
bear the date of their receipt. It will
be materially to the serviceability of
the law for the purpose we now have
in view If it were also prescribed that
all goods from storage for interstate
shipment should have plainly marked
VPon each package" the selling or
market price at which they went Into
storage.
"By this means the purchaser would
always be able to learn what profits i
stood between him and the producer
or the wholesaler dealer.
"It would serve as a aseful example
to the other communities of this coun
try as well as greatly relieve territor
ial distress if the congress were to
regulate all such matters very fully
for the District of Columbia, where
its legislative authority is without
limit.
. "I would also recommend that it
be required that all goods destined
for interstate commerce should in
every case where the form of package
makes it possible be plainly marked
with the price at which they left the
hands of. the producer. Such- a re
quirement would bear a. close analogy,
to certain provisions of the. pure food
act. by which it is required that cer
tain, detailed information be given on
the labels . of packages of food and
drugs. . .
."And It does npt seem to me that
we can confine ourselves to detailed
measures of this kind, if it Is indeed
our purpose to assume national con
trol of the processes of ' distribution.
I take it for granted that that is our
purpose nnd our duty. Nothing less
will suffice.
Would Force Competitive Selling
"We need go beyond thje measures
I have suggested, W. should formu
late a law requiring a federal license
of all corporations engaged in inter
state commerce, . and. embodying in
the license or in the conditions un
der which it is to be issued, specific
regulations designed to secure com
petitive selling and prevent uncon
scionable profit in the methods of
marketing. Such a law would afford
a welcome opportunity to effect other
much needed reforms in the business
of interstate shipfent, and in the
methods of corporations which are
engaged in it, but for the moment 1
confine my recommendations to the
object immediately it had, which is
to lower the cost of living.
"May I not add that there is a
measure which if passed by the con
gress would do much to stop specu
lation and to prevent the fraudulent
methods of promotion by which our
people are annually fleeced of mill
ions of hard earned money. I refer
to the measure proposed by the capi
tal issues committee for the control
of security issues. .It is a measure
formulated by men who know the
actual conditions of business and its
adoption would serve a great and
beneficlent purpose.
"We are dealing, gentlemen of the
congress, I need hardly say, with very
critical and very difficult matters. We
should go forward ' with confidence
along the road we see, but we should
also seek to comprehend the whole
of the scene amidst which we act.
No Ground For "Fearful Forecasts"
"There Is not ground for some of
distracted, she must show herself
self possessed, self-contained, capable)
or sober and effective action. She
saved Europe by her act in arms;
she must now save it by her act in
peace. In saving Europe she will
save herself, as she did upon the
battlefields of the war.
"The calmness and capacity with
which she deals with and masters the
problems of peace will be the final
test and proof of her place among
the peoples of the world.
Europe Our Biggest Customer
"And if only in our interest, we
must help the people overseas. Eu
rope is our biggest customer. We
mu6t keep her going or thousands of
our shops and scores of our mines
must close. There is no such thing
as letting her go to ruin without our
selves sharing in the disaster.
"In such circumstances passion
must be discarded. Passion and a
disregard for the rights of others
have no place in the counsel of a free
people. We need light, not heat, with
these eolemn times of self-examlna
tion and saving action.
"There must be no threats. Let
there be only intelligent counsel and
let the best reasons within, not the
strongest brute force, control. The
world has just destroyed the arbi

world is unquestionably very grave
and we should face it comprehend-ingly.
mill live under no other. All that is
arbitrary end coercive is in the dis
card. Those who seek to employ It
only prepare their own destruction.
"The situation of our own country i We cannot hastily and overnight
is exceptionally fortunate. We of all; revolutionize all the processes of our
peoples can arrord to keep our heads
and to demand upon moderate and
sensible courses of action which will
ensure us against the passions and
distempers which are working such
deep unhappiness f5r some of the dis
tressed nations on the other side of
the sea. But we may be involved In
their distresses unless we help, and
help with energy and intelligence.
"The world must pay for the ap
palling destruction wrought by the
Tgreat war and we as part of the world.
-must pay our share.
"For five years now the industry
of all Europe has been slack and dis
ordered. The normal crops have not
been produced; the normal quantity
of manufactured goods has not been
turned out. Not until there are the
usual crops and the production of
manufactured goods on the other side
can Europe return to the former con-
economic life. We shall not attempt
to do so. These are days of deep
excitement and of extravagant speech,
but with us these are things of the
surface.
"Everyone who is in real touch
with the masses of our great people
knows that the old strong fibre and
steady self control are still there,
firm against violence or any distem
pered action that would throw their
affairs into confusion. I am serenely
confident that they will readily find
themselves, no matter what the cir
cumstances, and that thSy will ad
dress themselves to the tasks of
peace with the same devotion and the
same stalwart preference for what Is
right that they displayed to the ad
miration of the, whole world in the
midst of war.
Appeals to' American Sentiment
"And I enter another confident

fairly with the people, it is their op !
portunity to show they now compre-1
hend, that they Intend to act Justly
and that they have the public inter-'
ests sincerely at heart And I have
no doubt that housekeepers all overj
the country, and every one who buys'
the things he daily stands in need of,
will presently exercise a greater vlg-j
ilance, a more thoughtful economy, a'
more discriminating care as to the
market in which he buys or the mer-j
chants with whom he trades than he,
has heretofore. j
Stopping Production Worst Evil t
"The worst thing, the most fatal ,
thing that can be done now is to stopl
or interrupt production or to inter-!
fere with the distribution of goods by
the railroads and the shipping of thej
country.
"We are all involved In the dlsJ
tressing results of the high cost of.
living, and we must unite, not divide,!
in regard to it. There are many
things that ought to be corrected In
the relations between capital and
labor, in respect of wages and Condi
tion of labor and other things even
more far-reaching, and I, for one, am
ready to go into conference about
these matters with any group of my
fellow countrymen, who know what
they are. talking about and are will
ing to remedy existing conditions by
frank counsel rather than by violent
contest. j
"No remedy Is possible while men
are in a temper, and there can be no
settlement which does not have as its
motive and standard the general In
terest. "Threats make settlement Impossi
ble, I believe, as I have hereto had

sult? Undoubtedly we have, and we
shall work it out. In the meantime
now snd in the days of reconstruc
tion let us resort more and more to
frank and intimate counsel and make
ourselves a great and triumphant na
tion by making ourselves a united
force, in the life of the world. Then
we have not lived In Tain."

HOT WEATHER HINTS
HELPFUL TD SHOPPERS
BY BIDDY BYE.
Beating the heat that's our chief
concern in these days.
And beating the heat to maintain
health and comparative comfort in
August weather is easy enough by
following a few simple health rules.
This feeling of being "too hot to
live" is partly psychological.
Keep your mind off the heat don't
watch the thermometer, don't think
only of the heat. Keep quietly busy
about some- task or amusement and
forget the temperature. Don't talk
about it, or read newspaper heat rec
ords and accounts of prostrations.
Keep the general health up to prop
er standard. Don't get run down.
Don't overwork mentally or physi
cally, and be careful to get a full al
lowance of both food and sleep.
When heavy high seasoned foods re
pel, there is provided the delicious
alternative of fresh vegetables of ev
ery tempting color and flavor. Follow
the food instinct in hot weather. Turn
from heavy dishes and confin-the
menu3 mostly to fruits, salads, breads,
cold cereals and vegetables, and add
plenty of frozen desserts and cool bev
erages. Get the necessary proteins
from meat, fish, cheese, nuts and
cereals.
Go to the market and buy the foods
in season. In fruits these include can
teloupes, watermelons, casawba mel
ons, blackberries, raspberries, grapes,
peaches, plums, late cherries, apri
cots, blueberries, pineapples, oranges,
bananas, lemons,; gooseberries, cur
rants and apples. The seasonable
vegetables include beans, green, wax
and lima, beets, carrots, cauliflower,
cucumber, eggplant,, tomatoes, peas,
peppers, onions, lettuce, radishes, po
tatoes, new turnips, besides spinach,
swiss chard, beet greens and water
cress.
There Is a wonderful array of good
things. Don't let the family meals get
in a rut. Go to the market, get sug
gestions, buy carefully and cook and
serve with that nice flavor of imagi
nation and scientific skill which
makes a meal a work of art instead
of a task.

FRENCH FEAR CATACLYSM.
nici pnvuuccvc e mnronnrcrt!liniv nvpr thp final outcome
PAIIIO l iuui.ij i
of political events in Eastern and Southeastern Europe than
any other problem affecting France's national security. Gov
" ernment and press frankly confess to a distinct, well defined
fear that conditions are rapidly moving from bad to worse'and that
without a firm adjustment within the next few months the turmoil
will involve all Europe ia another cataclysm. French apprehension
is understandable because of proximity to territory where national
and international quarrels are being fought out by elements which
may not give heed to trespass claims by innocent bystanders as for
instance France whose rights may be invaded by belligerents. The
Hungarian situation is the leading cause for alarm and it would be
foolish to pretend that French fears are without foundation, al
though possibly excited by exageration. The Hungarian menace is
real and pretentious enough to make even the great powers hesitate
about precipitancy in action, and to command deliberation before a
determinative decision is reached.
The situation, as leading French statesmen and editors see it,
is that to smash the Hungarians would be easy for the military
forces at command, but to administer Hungarian territory perman
ently would be a larger contract than France dares to risk or even
the Allies care to undertake. Hungarian successes in the East and
Southeast will increase the menace to France, since that may involve
co-operation with a certain numerically strong element of German
radicals which would make a powerful political chain stretching
from the French frontier into Russia. As the French see the im
mediate future they dare not stand idle while the Hungarians scatter
fire and powder all around, nor dare the French make intervention a
national enterprise even for their own safety. The Allies' recognize
the dangers but in spite of the threatening prospect have not been
able to agree upon a combined policy. .
Marshal Foch consistently with his professional leanings advises
immediate and crushing military action, hut his counsel has not been
accepted, although there is gradually developing the conclusion that
eventually intervention will be the only course and that it might as
well be now as later. French fear of the Hungarian danger is scarce
ly less pronounced that the old fear of Germany.
RECONSTRUCTING RUSSIA.
ORIS BAKHMETEFF, Russian ambassador at Washington and
one of the few apparently permanent elements in the Russian
flux of the last few years, has just returned from Paris. lie
is considerably cheered over the outlook for peace and orderly
government in his native land.
"It i3 with confidence and satisfaction that I look back on the
general progress of events in Russia during the la6t seven months,"
said M. Bakhmeteff. "Momentous processes as those which are tak
ing place in Rusisa must be judged as a whole and the results when
compared spaced in rather lengthy periods. Take, for instance, Rus
sia as it was a year ago with practically the whole of the country
under the sway of anarchy and with onlyfeeble attempts of Itera
tive movements perceptive. Compare this situation with the present
adn you will realize the change and where we stand."
The last few months in particular he finds encouraging. There
is now, he declares, complete unity of national action in Russian,
all anti-Bolshevik formations having recognized the government of
Admiral Kolchak, pledging loyalty to it. And the armies fighting the
Bolsheviks are steadily gaining in organization and unity of com
mand. "The process of healing and reconstiiution has revealed itself
clearly," he says. "The national movement has found its own and
found its leader. The outcome is certain a country liberated from
anarchy and national life reconstituted on firm foundations of law
and self government."
We hope he is correct in ii is interpretation of events. Certainiy
a united liberal Russia is indispensable to the establishment of stable
peace. And the effect of such a reconstruction will be hardly less,
on the rest of the world than on Russia itself.
j SHIPS AND MORE SHIPS. j
THE EMERGENCY Fleet Corporation is turning out ships in
fine style. Up to the middle of July it had delivered 1095
vessels totaling 6,O0S,739 deadweight tons. It had launched
" at the same time 1524 vessels with a deadweight tonnage
of 8,0o0,288 and had laid the keels of 2081 vessels with a deadweight
tonnage of 11,421,111.
The deliveries for the first six and a half months almost cquai
the total for 1918.
Between the launching of a ship and its deliveries there is a
period of nearly two months.
Shipbuilding on the Great Lakes is particularly active, three
times as many men being employed as during the war.
What the production of the American shiywards means may be
appreciated when it is said that the 20S1 vessels whose keels
have been laid represent nearly CO per cent of the total tonnage of
the merchant marine of Great Britain before the war.
And now we can demonstrate our idealism by paying Colombia
that twenty live million before the league is ready to make the world
safo for small nation. s
While deciding whether Bcrgcr is entitled to a neat, let's decide
whether a lot of others arc entitled to standing room in America.
No doubt Lieutenant "Hardboiled" Smith has moments when
he wishes he had been served sunny 'side up.
Chaloner, now legally Kane, says he will devote hi.s life to light
ing the "lunacy trust." The world has just finished fighting one
lunacy trust.
We wh.h to remain on friendly terms with Japan, but or, those
battleships went through the canal in ten hours.
Tho Austrian complaint is that the small territory left will not
Biipport Vienna in the style in which she was raised.
Dr. Otto Bauer says that Austria is doomed to thirty years of
economic slavery. Perhaps it will break her of that little habit ot
sending ultimatums.
The reason Heinie rejected overtures in September, 1917, was
becaues he. didn't know the doughboy would make overtures of an
other: sort In; the Argonne.

NEARLY 6000 TROOPS i Charle3 Olson on July-23. As a re-
IN DOUGLAS DISTRlCTl suit of his confession, at the request
DOUGLAS. Am. S.-Armv recruits' of the county attorney's office, a
are arriving at Camp Jones and other; bench warranj was issued and Mang
parts of the Arizona military district
following Monday being pay day, the
worthless bits of paper were passed
on local merchants without arousing
suspicion, the first intimation of the
faster than men are being discharged.
For the week ending last Saturday
the district showed a gain of 170 men
over the previous week.
Recruits are being received more
rapidly at outside points than at Camp
Jones. However, last week the First
cavalry gained 50 men and the 19th
infantry 15. The Tenth cavalry, at
Fort Huachuca, gained 80 and the
25th infantry, at Nogales, 50.
There are now approximately 5750
officers and enlisted men in the Ari
zona district. Douglas has 2200; No-
gales and environs, 2300; Ft. Hua
ham was rearrested and brought intot wholesale fraud coming with the re-
court, where his bail was raised fromi fusal of the checks in the afternoon
$750 to $1,000. j by the banks.
In the plot, Sessum confessed hei
had connived with Mangham and an j AVIATORS NARROWLY ESCAPE
unknown person to arrest Mr. and
Mrs. Hubbard and Olson, put the
liquor, seven cas.es, on a truck and
start for the city from the University
district. Half way to the police sta
tion, he confessed, he got out and
took the Hubbards and Olson with
him, while Mangham, as arranged, es
caped with the liquor. He then turn
ed his prisoners loose and told them
to keep quiet. This took place on
chuca, 1000. There are numerous! JuI' 21-
small detachments scattered at va
rious places, as for instance, SS at
Naco; 25 at Lowell, and 160 at Globe,
Miami, Ray and Jerome.
Emergency Men Impatient.
No additional information has been
received at district headquarters con
cerning the time when emergency
men will be released from the serv
ice. The date may be affected con
siderably by the action of congress In
making provision for the army. As
ytt the president. Las not issued his
proclamation declaring the emerg
ency has ceased to exist and under
the law emergency men may be held
for four months after the issuance of
the proclamation. This would be
practically until the first of 1920.
L is not believed, however, that
the men will be held nearly thai
long, the general impression being
that wholesale discharges will begin
the last of this month. Most of the
emergency men are extremely anx
ious to gPt back into civil life.
On the night of July 23 the Hub
bards and Orson were arrested by
deputy sheriffs while, it is alleged,
they were holding a whiskey party
on the lawn in front of the house in
the University district. The arrest
brought out the story of the opera
tions of Sessum, up to that time concealed.
NEW BRIDGE IS PLANNED
TO SPAN THE GILA RIVER
PHOENIX, Aug. 8 An agreement
that will doubtless be the means of
providing another bridge across the
Gila river and at the same time save
the sum of at least $100,000 in the
construction thereof, was entered in
to yesterday between the board of
supervisors and the state engineer.
By this agvteinent the county and
the highway department agree to go
50 50 in the sum of $6,000, the esti
mated expense of putting in the ad
ditional concrete piling necessary to
carrv a bridge across t he dam being
constructed by the Gilespio interests
near Arlington. '
This plan to put then ridge across
at this point, using the dam as the
footings, the part of any bridge that
usually runs up the cost. It would
probably cost in excess of $200,000 to
bridge the Gila at ttiis point along
conventional lines, according to
Thomas Maddock. state engineer, and
the putting in of this additional pil
ing will enable the dam to be used
as footing, thus saving at least half
the cost of the bridge.

EDUCATION THE SOLUTION
New York Herald.
There is one solution in England
as in America, and that is economic
education and political union against
radical socialism. Government own
ership is not wanted in England nor
in the United States. We have had
enough of it here so has England?
but it may require a political read
justment in both countries to stem
the tide. For these reasons Ameri
cans view England's present crisis
with no little anxiety and trust that
the war against radical socialism and
Bolshevism threatening the heart of
the British empire will be as suc
cessful as the war against Germany.
ANOTHER TRY FOR BUDGET
New York World.
The senate anticipated the house in
appointing a committee to report on
the budget system, but if both agree
upon that step for the present it
should be a fair promise of positive
achievement" next winter. Former
Speaker Champ Clark pointed out the
real danger to this reform when he
said that, aside from the house ap
propriations committee, "there are
six other appropriating committees,
and that gives you 147 consolidated
votes against reducing the powers of
those committees." The test will
come when the national Interests are
weighed against , the personal wishes
of a large number of members to re
tain their present powers as commit
teemen.
WASHINGTON, Aug. S. All day
long, from a witness chair before the
house interstate commerce committee,
Glenn E. Plumb, counsel for the rail
road brotherhoods and author of or
ganized labor's plan for tripartite
control of the railroads, responded to
day to sharp questioning from the
semi-circle of committee members
who ealled on him to explain every
phase of the labor bill.
Through it all, Mr. Plumb clung
steadfastly to the assertion that the
railroad unions aimed "to eliminate
the motive of operation for profit,
and substitute the motive of opera
tion for service," to which he added
corollary that "it means democracy
in industry, without which democracy
in politics is a mere shell and sham."
Gravely Plumb talked of revolutions
as an alternative In case the adop
tion of 'some such plan" was not
obtained by political action through
congress, and said that was the de
termination of the masses of men
wnom he represented, "though I hope
never to live to see the "day,"
The income of the Plumb Plan
league, organized to forward the
labor bill's passage, be said was "in
the neighborhood of $100,000 or less
than $125,000 annually now," though
only organized in July. He Intimated
that Its income shortly would be
$500,000 and implied that it might
run up to five or six millions.
All of it, he said, was coming from
brotherhood members.
"The situation is that our men be
lieve they have come to a new day,"
Plumb told the committee. "They
have spent their money and their
lives to secure liberty, and have now
found that without liberty and dem
ocracy in industry they have only the
shell of liberty to live. We intend to
get it lawfully, and through the con
stitution by the ballot."
JEROME YOUTHS REAPING

IN ACCIDENT AT YO.'vTA, ARIZ.
YUMA. Aug. S. United States
army officers manning a border pa
trol airplane on its first regular trip
alone the border from Rockwell
Field, Cal., to Yuma,' narrowly es
caped death yesterday morning when
the machine they were driving land,
ed upside down in a cotton field be
longing to W. N. Bunton in the San
Pasqual valley. Lieutenant J. A.
Madarasz and Lieutenant A. B. Chap
man, the aviators matning the plane,
were not injured.
After arriving over Yuma the avia
tors were unable to locate the avia
tion field. They circled over the city
for forty-five minutes and until their
supply of gasoline had become so low
that an immediate landing was neces
sary. The officers picked out the
Bunton cotton field as the safest
place in this icinity to make a land
ing and volplaned to earth.
As the machiae came down it "top
ped" the cotton for several hundred
yards, then hit and ground and turn
ed over. Mr. Bunton had just finish
ed irrigating the cotton and as a re
sult the wheels of the plane sank into
the mud. The suddenness witn
which the plane stopped caused it to
turn over.
A large crowd gathered at the
place where the airplane struck the
earth. The aircraft was but slightly
damaged and was speedily righted.
The aviators crawled out from under
their machine without a scratch. The
plane will be dismantled and shipped
back to Rockwell Field.
THEIR AFFAIR ANYWAY
Springfield Republican.
What Germany meant by intimate
economic relations with Belgium is
further outlined by the revelations
made by the national Zeitung in re
gard to the views of the military au
thorities in 1917. They contemplated
the inclusion of Belgium within the
German customs union, German con
trol, of Belgian taxation and Belgian
railways, the adoption by Belgium ot
the German monetary system, etc.
Not a shred of Belgian independence
would have been left. Whether the
Germans choose to blame William
II or Ludendorff 6r Michaells is their
affair, but they do not have to look
outside their own country to fix the
blame fop the protraction of the war
and the ruin of Germany.
GIRL MAKES SOME
CANNING RECORD
S AFFORD, Aug. 8. It is not an
uncommon thing for the Kirls in the
canning clubs to can 250 jars of pro
ducts, but it is quite a diflerent story
when every jar of that number rep
resents a different product. Such
was the achievement' accomplished
by Miss Wyona Taylor, aged 15 years,
of Pima.
This is the high record for the
checks, made out to one Albert E.
Anderson for $76.34 was received by state, the previous high lecord being
i local bank.
The check was cashed in Alhary
bra, California, Thursday afternoon,
which indicates, in the opinion of
tho local authorities, that tho crim
inals are making a leisurely tour of
the' Pacific coast, cashing checks now
and then to defray expenses. They
have in their possession about sixty-
six of the steam shovel checks, J
twelve of tho original seventy-eight;

MINORITY STRIKES
New York Times.
If all unionists struck together they
could impose their will upon the other
nine-tenths of the community for so
long a time as the preponderant ma
jority would submit to unionist dom
ination. Sometimes a minority of a
minority attacks the general welfare
In this current month Seattle starts
its triple alliance of trade unionists,
railway brotherhoods and farmers.
They have postponed their declara
tion of principles Until January, and
until then "an agitation for organi
zation unity will be continued." It
will be necessary, and in proportion
that it is successful there also will
be necessary an agitation for unity
against this intrusion of Sovietism or
Bolshevism regardless of law or reason.

THAT ARMY FOOD SALE
New York Sun.
In the United States there are
more than 20,000,000 families. Their
food bills are now running, at the
most conservative estimate, more
than $50,000,000 a day, more than a
billion and a half ot dollars a month,
more than eighteen billions of dollars
a year. Distribution amounting to
only a dollar a head for one single
time isn't going to make a dent in
such a colossal food crisis. If the
house of representatives wants to get
at this problem in earnest, and surely
it does; if it wants to help the public
at once it must get at the funda
mental cause the cause which Is op
crating so disastrously at breakfast,
at dinner, at supper time, day in and
day out, week after week and month

Over Bobby Green
TUCSON, Aug. 8. Bobby Green
was knocked down twice in the con
cluding rounds of his ten round fight
with Al McManus tonight. Only the
gong saved him from a knockout at

The first knockdown came in tho
ninth round and the last at the end
of the tenth round. Ho got to his

the gong rang.
' The fight was clever throughout.
Both men showed class and speed.
McManus had the advantage of Green

ROSS htOPES TO COLLECT
R. R. INHERITANCE TAX
PHOENIX, Aug. 8. H. S. Ross,
state treasurer, is ever finding new
sources of revenue for the state- treas
ury. His latest endeavor in this di
rection is to ascertain if railroad
stock cannot be assessed with other
property of an estate in determining
the amount of inheritance tax.
In two estate matters which are
before him. there are numerous hold
ings of Santa Fe and Southern Pa
citie- stock. In one estate there i
over $1,000,000 in stork and iu anoth
er the amount is $248,ooo. (
Heieiofore such stock has not,' been
considered on the ground that it rep
resented property not in Arizona but
in many states. Conies now Ross
with tht id?a tint it ou&bt to be au
easy matter to prorate the capital of
the company in .such a way as to
show the actual valuation of property
in Arizona. Turning to Poor's man
ual he finds that practically seven
per cent of the mileage of both the
Southern Pacific and Santa Fe are in
Arizona. From this he computes the
value of the capital stock in this
state and is ready to coileet one per
cent as inheritance tax the same as
on other property.
Ross has written a letter to the at
torney general, asking what he
thinks about it.

MAKING WHISKEY STILLS
IS NEW OUTDOOR SPORT
PHOENIX, Aug. 8. Large num
bers or stills for the manufacture of
pure corn whiskey are being made
and used right in the city of Thoenix
and just as many more are being
used in various hidden places around
the county, according to Sheriff
Montgomery. The sheriff stated yes
terday he was well aware certain in
dustries in Phoenix were furnishing
materials for the making of stills, but
that it was next to impossible to se
cure evidence against the manufac
turers of whiskey, due to the fact that
the stills are small and it is easy to
attach them to a nearby sewer, thus
stilling all odors that might betray
(heir presence.
Evidence that hundreds of dollars
worth of corn whiskey is being made
hereabouts was secured h few days
uno when well-set-up still whs con
fiscated west of the city. The run of
liquor, had it been allowed to go
through befoic the arrest of the man
in charge would have been worth
over $1800. The still had a capacity
of 14 barrels.
The whiskey which is being made
is pure white in color and contains a
large percentage of alcohol. The fed
eral authorities ate handicapped in
searching for the illicit stills by a
shortage of field men in this vicinity,
but the sheriff is co-operating with
them and the two offices together are
doing everything possible to make it
hot for the whiskey makers.

STOCKS AND BONDS
NEW YORK, Aug. 8. The extreme
ly active and very irregular course of
trading on the stock exchange today,
was almost wholly traceable to im
pending developments at Washington,
and the extension of labor troubles.
Prices of active stock?, seasoned aa
well as 3pe.;uiative ibsuos, were 1 to 6
points higher at the excited opening.
Rail3 and a few of the high priced
specialties, such as tobaccos, proved
the only conspicuous exceptions to the
rally, which gave way, however, to
another extensive selling movement at
midday. For the balance ot ie ses
sion the record was one ot almost
steady betterment, favorites among in
ausinais, noiaDiy united states steel,
reflectng accumulation of a substan -
tial character.
Short covering contributed in no
small degree to the market's stability,
with numerous gains of 2 to 10 points.
Sales amounted to 2,050,000 shares.
Bonds were weak at the outset, spec-
ulative Issues lasing 1 to 2V& points,
with partial recoveries later. Total
saies, par vaiue, aggregated 14,7&0, -
on call.
WOOL MARKET DULL
BOSTON, Aug. 8. The Commercial
Bulletin tomorrow will say:
"The wool market has experienced
being in spots. Prices, however, have
been maintained on a steady basis.
Very little now is being purchased in
the west.
"The foreign markets are all re
ported steady. Tha English govern
ment has allotted 19,000 bales or co
lonial wool to American purchasers
out of the sales commencing August 11
The goods market is strong with
comparatively little excitement."
Scoured basis: Texas fine twelve
months $1.651.75; fine eight months
$1.381.40; territory, fine staple,
$1.851.90; half blood combing $1.70

H. C. L. AFFECTING TRADE
NEW YORK, Aug. 8. Dunn's tomor
row win say;
"The agitation against high living
cost3, growing in intensity and finding
reflection in the increasing unrest or
labor, has not been without influence
on business. Instead of the prepon
derance of advance which has char
acterized the movement of wholesale
cummoauy quotations IOr a long pe-
riod, recessions this week are slightly
in the majority, and some markets
uiai are largely swayea ay speculation
have experienced abrupt reaction. Ac-
price developments there has been a
distinct spread of caution in commer -
cial circles, with a tendency to await
a clearer insight into the future and
a uiuucmuuu ul tttuviues nas oc
curred in certain quarters."
The weekly bank clearings were
$7,499,511,171.
THE GRAIN MARKETS
CHICAGO. Aug. 8. Anticipation
which were more than fulfilled that
the government crop report would be
bullish did a good deal to turn the
prices of all deliveries of corn upward
today at the last. The close was ner
vous ot IV4C to 4c net higher with
September $1.89 to $1.90 -and De
cember $1.50 to $1.51V4. , Oats gain
ed 1V cents to 1'vgC On provisions
the outcome ranged from 15 cents de
cline to 10 cents advance. Government
figures on tlie prospective yield of
corn came too late to have any direct
influonc eon the market.
Oats swayed with corn. Guesses be-
lore nana on tne government crop
report as to oats were generally out-
Labor difliculties that made "hog
values weak were reilecled by provi
sions. Trading most of the time was
slightly li&ht.
THE METAL MARKET
NEW YORK, Aug. 8. Lead, easy;
spot $5.50 to $5.60; spelter, weak; spot
East St. Louis delivered $7.00 to $7.30.

ACCIDENTAL, IS
. K. PITZER
Switchman Fell Under Car
When His Hands Slipped Off
Brakes, Coroner's Jury Find;
Body Was Terribly Crushed
Uravoidable accident was the ver
dict of a coroner's jury rendered last
evening at the inquest conducted by
Justice of the Peace James Allison
into the death of W. K. Pitzer, the
El Paso & Southwestern switchman
who was run over and killed by a
car near the Czar shaft Thursday
night. Pitzer, who was terribly
crushed and mangled, lived for sev
eral hours after the accident and was
conscious most of the time, but died
shortly after midnight yesterday at
the Copper Queen hospital.
Seven witnesses, among them rail
road men who saw the accident, testt
fied at the inquest. It appeared that
Pitzer was attempting to set the
brakes on a car. which had been
"kicked" onto a side track on the hill
by a locomotive, but that his hands
slipped and he fell under the car. No
reason could be ascribed for the acci
dent except that his hands must have
slipped.
The wheels did not pass over Pit
rer's body but he was caught by the
brake rigging under the car, dragged
for some feet and badly crushed. The
car ran up the grade a few yards and
then, Pitzer having been unable to set
the brakes, it rolled back down the
grade 1 and over his body a second
time.
Pitzer was a member of the Kenova,
West Virginia, lodge of Masons, and
also had a brother at Roanoke, Va.
The body, which is at the Palace un
dertaking rooms, will be sent either
to Kenova or Roanoke for burial.
Definite instructions from his rela
tives are now being awaited.
Pitzer also belonged to the Eagles
and to the Switchmen's union. He
had worked at Yuma and Proscott,
among other places in the state. He
was about 35 years old and unmarried.
The members of the coroner's jury
were W. A. Campbell. William Arndt,
Edward Clague, O. S. French, W. J.
Hartley and L. A. Ritchey. .
Gen. Calles Defied In
Mescal War, Report
DOUGLAS, Aug. 8. Presidents
Municipal Jorge Tato of Agua Prieta,
has defied Gov. P. Elias Calles, ac
cording to well authenticated reports
in Agua Prieta, and has refused to
obey the governor's orders, including
one demanding his resignation as
presidente.
The trouble, it is said. Is the result
of Governor Calles determination to
enforce his recent decree against the
manufacture and sale of mescal. The
story goes that , a few days ago Gov
ernor Calles telegraphed Mr. Tato and
ordered that he send at once to Her
mosillo any person or persons, male
or female, who had been or were vio
lating his order prohibiting the sale
of mescal.
Mr. Tato answered that it would be
impossible to do that, whereupon the
governor replied that he must either
obey the order or resign as presi
dente. To this Mr. Tato is said to
have replied that he would do neither,
virtually defying the governor.
What the outcome of the clash will
be nobody knows, but it has created
considerable excitement in Agua Prie
ta, where the sentiment is strongly
back of Presidente .Tato. The office
of presidente municipal is elective.
Whether the occupant, can be re
moved by the governor remains to be
seen.

DEATH VERDICT
n
SILVER BELL'S
FAMOUS HUES
ARE REOPENED
Closed Since Armistice, Old
Camps Resume Work With
Rising Copper Price, Tucson
District Is Flourishing Again
Edward Massey, deputy state mine
inspector, is back from the mining
country around Tucson and the Silver
Bell district and reports a gratifying
resumption of development work in
production in both sections. Silver
Bell, one of the famous old camps of
the state, which has been opened up
closed down and reopened more times
perhaps than any place In the state,
is again resuming operations.
The mines at Silver Bell closed
down soon after the armistice, after
a highly profitable war-time produc
tion, but with the increased price of
copper they are again coming to the
front. Mr. Massey reported that the
El Tiro property, which is being
worked by Percy Williams, has a
force of 35 men and is shipping 450
tons of ore a month.
The North Star mine in the Twin
Euttes district, belonging to the Mid
land Copper company, has struck a
4 to five-foot vein of ore while
drifting on the 250-foot level, that
will run five percent sulphide.
The Queen, also owned by the Mid
land company, has shipped 200 tons
of 15 per cent ore.
At Mineral Hill the Consolidated
Copper company Is doing develop
ment work and has opened up a big
body of ore on the 700-foot level
which will be shipped to Tucson. The
company expects to construct its own
mill within a year.
DECLARED
Eleven , Arrests Made In Last
Three Days; New, Stricter
Traffic Ordinance Is Now
Being Drawn By City Atty.
In line with the city authorities' de
termination that reckless automobile
driving and the violation of the traf
fic ordinances must cease, Chief of
Police Kempton and his men are con
ducting a vigorous campaign down
town in an effort to straighten out
the automobile tangle.
Three arrests were made yester
day, and four on each of the two pro
ceeding days for various violations of
the traffic laws. The three arrests
made yesterday were all for parking
near a fire-plug.
"It seems too bad to arrest people
on these trivial charges and compel
them to pay fines," Chief Kempton
said yesterday, "but it seems to be
necessary. Any person who drives
an automobile should know the rule
against parking near a fire plug, and
yet they continue to do so and risk
arrest, rather than drive on a little
farther.
"The same in regard to passing a,
standing street car. This is a highly
dangerous practice and strictly
against the law, and yet motorists
will 'take a chance' and drive by a
street car when it is loading or un
loading passengers, rather than wait
a minute, and then complain bitterly
when they are arrested.
"All the traffic ordinances are sen
Bible, if the motorist will only look
at them in the right light. They safe
guard the many against the few and
are necessary if the streets are to
be kept safe for pedestrians. There
has been too much laxity in the past,
but from now on the ordTances must
be obeyed."
City Attorney Sam Kyle was in con
ference with Chief Kempton yester
day drawing up a new traffic ordi
nance. This will cover many points
not now covered in the present traffic
regulations and will provide jail sen
tences for confirmed speeders ana
for those driving a car while intoxi
cated.
The action, of Justice of the Peace
j. l. Winters Thursday in sentencing
a speeder who had been repeatedly
warned, to a day in jau, was umvers
ally commended by the city officials
yesterday.

Burns and Lincoln
' Bout Is Called Off;
Burns Gets 'Roast'
Instead of the Burns-Lincoln match
at Nogales tonight, the Line city will
have n a bout between Whirlwind
Langford of the 25th infantry, and
Rufus Williams. The Burns-Lincoln
scrap was scheduled first for tonight,
then postponed a week and finally
called off entirely.
The disagreement arose over the
fact that after terms were reached,
Burns decided to hold out for a big
ger split on gate receipts.
The fighting fans, though some
what disappointed at the unsports
manlike affair which resulted when
these two fighters laBt met at No
gales, were inclined to give Burns
the benefit of the doubt and see
them go together once more. Now
their attitude will be different.
The Nogales Herald came out with
an editorial reading Burns out of the
game in the state and asking that the
fans prevail upon Governor Campbell
to appoint a boxing commission in
the state. This telegram received
from Burns explains the situation:
"After accepting your terms over
telephone, I saw my mistake. Wired
you from Tucson my terms. No re
ply from you. Was ordered to Doug
las today. Won't be able to come
here. on ninth. Date week later O.
K. Three hundred and privilege of

"BOBBY BURNS."
The editorial In the Nogales Herald
anent Burns' flop follows, in part:
"Bobby Burns a pugilist, who car
ries about with him the title of box
ing instructor of the southern de
partment of , the United States army,
has refused to live up to a telephonic
agreement to box Ralph Lincoln, in
Nogales Saturday night.
"By his recent actions, that of
striking Referee Brown when a de
rision was rendered against him In
his recent fight here with Lincoln,
and his "run out" on the promoters.

Losing Race, Lowell
Peace Officers Try
Strategy and Win
Deputy Sheriff Tom Foster and H.
H. Bohmfalk, two of Lowell's heavy
weight guardians of the law, qualified
as marathon runners Thursday night
as the result of -a shooting affray in
"Tiritown" in which one Mexican was
shot through the leg. The two of
ficers loped up the hills after the
Mexican accused of the shooting and
while they did not win the race, be
isg distaaced from the start, they
showed promising lon-distance QaaI
ties. They returned to town minus sev
eral pounds in ilesh and rlso minus
the 'Mexican, but they tried strategy
yesterday morning instead of speed
and landed tht man behind the bars
after corraiing hirr. in hit "Tintcwn"

The shooting appears to have been
the result of a "good-natuie 1" alcohol
party in Tintown whi:h latpr h-ok up
in a row anl In which a gun was
drawn. In the melee the weapon was
discharged and Manuel Llevas was
shot through the leg. The officers
rere called and Juan Bersino, ac
cused of the shooting, took to the hills
with Foster and Bohmfolk in pursuit.
Bersino showed that with two depu
ties after him he can do 100 yards in
better than ten seconds.
Bersino was arraigned before Jus

persons as Burns, who have no idea
of a gentleman's agreement.
"Such actions as indulged in by
Burns killed the racing and fight
game in California. Double crossers
and four-flushers in the boxing game
should not be allowed to obtain a toe
hold in Arizona.
"It is suggested that a boxing, com

Governor Campbell to regulate the
game in the state In order that the
promoters and public be protected. IV
is also suggested that a blacklist be
established for pugilists of the Burns

BISBEE SCHOOL
FOR TEACHERS
ENDS SESSIONS
Examinations Being Conducted
Today; Attendance For This
Year, and General Interest
Shows Gratifying Increase
Yesterday was the last day of the
summer school which has been con
ducted here for the past six weeks
under the auspices of the University
of Arizona, and today examinations
are being held. Teachers and pupils
are making plans either to take their
vacations, or to remain here and con
tinue at work.
Prof. H. H. Foster, who has been in
charge of the school,' expressed him
seir yesterday as highly pleased with
the success of this term. There were
45 pupils as against 30 last year, and
there was manifest an encouraging in
crease in interest. While started as
an experiment, the summer, school
now seems assured of becoming a
permanent institution.
Of the six teachers from the faculty
of the university who have been in at
tendance at the school. Miss Beulah
Coon will leave for Los Angeles and
Mr3. A. E. Douglas will continue her
work in the schools here.
Professor Foster and Superinten
dent of Schools C. F. Philbrook will
leave Wednesday by auto for an out
ing trip in the northern part of the
state around Prescott. They will
spend the time camping out and in
hunting and fishing. Professors Honn,
Gordon and Payne probably will ac
company them.
No formal exercises will mark the
close of the summer school session,
for, as Dr. Foster said yesterday, the
term has been one in which hard
work was the main feature.
Bisbee Club Plays the 19th
Infantry at Douglas, Lowell
Meets 1st Cav. in Warren,
Bisbee Cubs Play In Willcox
All three baseball clubs of the War
ren district will be in action tomor
row, the newly reorganized Bisbee
Cubs have nade arrangements to go
over to Willcox and take on the crack
nine of that city. The regular Bisbee
club will go against the Nineteenth
Infantry at Douglas, and Bert Whal
ing's reinforced Lowellites will clash
with the First Cavalry at the Warren
grounds.
The Bisbee Cubs, undr the man
agement of Al Kobey, have been
strengthened by the addition of two
new men. Purse, outfielder, and Jef
frey, pitcher. The team is composed
exclusively of Bisbee talent, no im
ported men or professionals being
used. The battery in Sunday's game
with Willcox probably will be Coch
ran and Kobey.
The Lowell team will have in its
line-up against the cavalrymen the
four players from El Paso who have
been "blacklisted" by the club in that
city which they left when they came
here to play. The "blacklist" story
caused considerable amusement
among the players yesterday. In the
first place, the club to .which they
belonged and the one in which they
are now playing are not in organized
baseball and any "blacklist" could not
be effective.
The players say they notified the
manager of their intention to leave,
but that he went to Cloudcroft a day
or so later, and was not in El Paso
when they left for-Bisbee. They could
not wait for his return to have a form
al leave-taking and to this they at
tributed their "blacklisting." They
were only getting $96 a month in El
Paso and could not well afford to pass
up the offer made them by the Lowell
club.
Brandt and Le Brandt will be the
battery for Lowell in tomorrow's
game.
A large crowd will accompany the
regular Bisbee team to Douglas in the
hope that the boys will succeed in
stopping their recent losing streak
and hang up a victory against the sol
diers. Lu Princeton Loses

PUSH IRK ON
NEW BARRACKS
AT CAMP NACO
Present Delay In Building Is
Only Temporary Says Capt.
. Seymour; Vast Plans Made
By U. S. for Work on Border
Capt. Seymour, constructing quar
termaster at Camp Naco, says that
work on the new barracks there has
been delayed on account of curtail
ment of all construction work along
the Mexican border. He expects,
however, Ihat the tieup from "higher
up" will soon straighten out suffi
ciently to enable him to push along
the extensive work planned for Camp
Naco. Captain Seymour expects soon
to make his home at Warren.
An idea of what the war depart
ment is doing to care for its soldiers
in war camps along the international
boundary from El Paso to 50 rufies
west of Noglaes, Ariz., can be ob.
tained when it is considered that 596
buildings are to be constructed for
that purpose in nine different camps.
Water systems go with all these
camps and sewer and lighting sys
tems in most of them.
O. P. Kroeger and F. M. Hayner
have charge of all work west of El
Paso to Nogales. The construction at
the nine camps follews:
At Columbus, N. M., there are to
be 320 buildings, all frame and now
well under way; also sewer and
water systems.
At Douglas, Ariz., there are to be
90 buildings, with sewer and water
systems.
At Hachita, N. M., 15 buildings were
started this week, together with
sewer, water and light systems.
At Fort Huachuca, Ariz., there
were started this week 41 buildings.
A watsr system goes in at this camp.
At Culbertson's ranch, south .- of
Hachita, there are to be 11 buildings,
a new water storage tank and water
system. This work has not been
commenced.
' At Naco, Ariz., work not com
menced, there are t6 be 35 adobe
buildings and water and sewer sys
tems. This is the only border post
where the buildings are to be of
adobe and the adobe are not yet
made.
At Nogales there will be 73 frame
buildings and a complete sewer sys
tem. This camp was best prepared
of any west of El Paso to have the
work done, as Capt. Capron has ma
terials assembled therefore. .
Out from Nogales are to be two
outposts, Arivaca, 50 miles west and
north, where are to be six buildings,
with a complete water system ; and at
Lochiel. 26 miles southwest of No
gales, where will be built six build
ings and a sewer system.
