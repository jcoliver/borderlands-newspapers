Lasater Asserts Food Admin

Agriculture Aided Firms in
Holding Up Meat Prices
(Bv P. -view Iasd Wir
"WASHINGTON'. Feb. 3. The food
administration and the department of
agriculture aided the fire big packing
firms in obtaining a monopolistic
control of the meat packng industry,
Edward C. Lasater. of the National
Livestock association's executive com
mittee and a former employe of the
food administration, testified today
before the house interstate commerce
committee.
While Mr. Lasater was making this
charge and asserting that he had re
signed from the food administration
because he realized "its practices were
harmful to the common welfare." L. D.
H. Weld, manager of Swift & Co. re
search department, told the senate ag
riculture committee that a combina
tion of the big packers to control the
meat industry was impossible because
of the large number of Independent
concerns.
Mr. Lasater asserted before the
houae committee that during the last
IS months the food administration
had "served as a screen" behind which
the packers operated illegally agains-.
the public's interests. When asked
what the illegal acts of the packers
caa oeen, Mr. Lasater replied he
would answer in detail later.
Submits Letter
The department of agriculture aided
the packers. Mr. Lasater charged, by
delaying investigation of the meat
growers by the federal trade commis
sion at. the time the packers them-
selves were being investigated.
Mr. Lasater submitted a letter from
W. J. Spillman, former chief of the
bureau of farm management of the de
partment of agriculture, in which Mr.
Spillman said Secretary Houston re
tarded investigation of the producers
by refusing to authorize appointment
of 15 investigators. He added that the
"""'J iirni 10 discontinue leave last nignt ior rnoenix, naving i ceivea irom uoau says the boishe-, cents a ton. Sale of col lands would

tion was Tor agitators like this man

Next day, Mr. Spillman wrote, he
received a letter from Secretary Hous
ton notifying him that every project
cdnnected with the investigation was
discontinued. Mr. Spillman said the

tecretary authorized the appointment

In bis testimony before the senate
committee. Mr. Weld said Swift &
Co.'s earnings for the period of the

parea wun tne three years ending!

SUIT DISMISSED

the requirements of the law had not

BV HIGH COURT
(By Review Leaned Wire)
PHOEXIX. Ariz., Feb. 3. The state
supreme court today handed down a
decision ordering a new trial for
George Elmer, sentenced from Graham
county to a term of imprisonment of
from fiTe to 25 years for an offens
against his daughter.
In rendering Oils decision the su
preme court reversed the judgment
of Judge A. G. McAllister of the bu:
pcrior court of Graham county. wio
refused the conTicted man a re-tria:.
The supreme court pointed out the
merit of the assignment of error con
tained in the appeal, which referrea
to taking of testimony against the
prisoner, including statements said to
have been made by the girl, though
she herself had not been called as a
witness in the case.
Ross Suit Fails
The suit of Harry S. Ross-, seeking
to recover $1,350 additional salary as
treasurer of Cochise county, again
failed in the supreme court, dismiss
ing the original action. The supreme
court, however, vacated the trial
court'a judgment on the county's cross
compialnt and remanded tbi with in
structions for its dismissal. - "
Ross commenced his action in the
superior court in August. 1917, found
ing his claim on an order of the board
of supervisors of Cochise county fix
ing his salary at $3600.
The county's cross-complaint, filed
in September, 1917. alleged that the
amount of the treasurer's salary was
fixed by the laws of 1901 and amend
ments, at $2300, that the plaintiff had!
been paid $3000, according to the sal
ary law of 19L2, which had been de
clared invalid ia the courts and con
cluded by demanding judgment for
the difference, $1350.
Action Dismissed
The plaintiff entered a demurrer,
which was dismissed by the superior
court, which awarded the county $500
on its cross-complaint. Ross, the
plaintiff, then appealed, which action
was dismissed in the supreme court
today.
The case was leard originally to
the superior court by Judge A. G. Mc
Allister. Failing to record any notice of ap
peal, cost the appelant the decision ra
the appeal of the Copper State Min
ing company against Tom Wills, in
the decision handed down in the su
preme court. The original suit was
heard before Judge O. J Baugh in the
superior court of Pinal county and re

120 READY FOR CONFERENCE
(Hv Review leased Wire)
BERNE. Feb. 3. One hundred and
twenty delegates, representing 12
countries, have arrived to attend the
international socialist conference here.
Eduard Bernstein, the German social
ist, who was to have attended, has
been detained in Germany. One hun
dred and fifty newspaper men have
also arrived.
The Swiss socialists, who yester
day decided not to participate in the
conference, are becoming more hostile
to it and resent the appointment of
M. Grumbach, who is an Alsatian, as
the head of the press bureau.
Regret is expressed by all the repre
sentatives that American delegates
will be absent and this is considered
by many to be a hard blow to the Germans.

TOMBSTONE. Ariz Feb. 3 Fol
lowing the appearance today before
the board of supervisors in their regu
lar monthly meeting of Dr. Frank V.
Randall, county physician in charge
of the county hospital af Douglas, the
clerk of the board. L. F. Kuchenbeck
er. was instructed to address a letter
of reprimand to "Walter Bowman, resi
dent superintendent of the hospital.
Bowman's- refusal to attend to his
diuies as resident superintendent and
his evident independence in the face
of orders from his superior. Dr. Rand
all, occasioned the reprimand.
Chairman L C. E. Adams of the
board, instructed the clerk of the
board to address the letter to Bowman.
"Tell him. said Mr. Adams, "that
Dr. Randall Is his superior, that he
will hereafter take his orders from
Dr. Randall, that he will hereafter re
main at the hospital a reasonable
number of hours each day. and that
he will otherwise conduct himself as
Is becoming of the position. We do not
want any man working for the county
who is 'not efficient and trustworthy."
Bowman Not at Hospital
"While -the board was hearing the
report on Bowman's conduct, a long
distance call which had been placed
by C. "W. Roberts, member, for Bow
man, was received. Mr. Bowman, de
clared the telephone operator, was. not
at the hospital and would not return
nntil 4 o'clock. Dr. Randall explained
that he and the matron had come to
Tombstone on eurt orders, and that
the resident superintendent should
have remained at the tospital for
emergency cases.
Tell him In his letter," Mr. Rob
erts suplemented Mr. Adams' instruc
tions, "that we wish an explanation
of why he was away from the hospital
when both Dr. Randall and the matron
were absent."
Dr. Randall told the board that he
has had difficulty in securing the co
operation of Bowman. He declared he
had remonstrated with him about leav
ing the institution each afternoon and
evening.
Started Trouble, is Charge
Tm not going to spend 24 hours on
this job." he replied, according to Dr.
Randall. He also has convinced the
employes at the hospital, declared the
doctor, that they are not getting
enough pay and that they are work
ing too long hours.
Mr. Sparks told the board he would
"confess" he had heard reports of un
savory flavor during the past ten days,
but that since he "had not supported
either Dr. Randall or Bowman he had
not brought the matter to the atten
tion of the board.
Stay on Job or Resign '
"We appreciate your confession."
Mr. Adams told him. 'This a mat
ter which concerns us all directly, and
In which we all are interested vitally."
The board members were all of the
opinion that the superintendency is
not a sinecure or eight-hour job. and
thai the man who has it should attend
his duties fully even if it takes the
full day.
"Either Mr. Bowman will attend his
work." declared Mr. Adams in dismiss
ing the subject, "or send in his resig
nation. If he fails in either of these
duties, it will be up to the board to
act, and you can rest assured the
board intends having a competent mat:
on that job."

The dairymen, it was said late today

regulations, if enforced, would drive
them to heavy expenditures for equip

there is no present demand.

Evaporation at San Carlos
Twenty years ago a hue and cry went up from every part of Arizona
when construction was started on the Roosevelt dam, at the junction of
Salt River and Tonto creek on the border line between Gila and Mari
copa counties.
.Even the pioneers of the Salt River valley at Mesa and Phoenix said
construction of the reservoir would prove a failure. Hundreds of citi
xena with progressive ideas scoffed at the suggestion that the Roose
velt dam would make a garden of thousands of arid acres.
"The dam will fill up with refuse and drift," they declared.
"The Salt and the Tonto can't feed the dam enough water to keep
it half filled," others exclaimed.
"Evaporation will decrease the water supply until it becomes negli
gible." cried the skeptic with a shrug of the shoulders.
The wisest of the wise-acres winked, in knowing, owl-like manner and
predicted with assurance a gigantic failure.
But, the Roosevelt reservoir has exploded all of these objections. It
has not filled with dirt and silt; th Salt and Tonto have kept it amply
filled with good mountain water; evaporation has not effected the supply
of water; and a garden of untold wealth has been planted where sage
brush and greasewood once blossomed a yellow spring.
The same objections have been raised against the construction of the
San Carlos dam on the Gila river, in the vicinity of the San Carlos Indian
reservation. As a matter of fact, these objections are bunk pure, un
adulterated, simple bunk. A little study of a map, a moment's perusal of
the report of the United States geological survey on the project, and a
mite of gray matter will convince the average man of this fact.
The Roosevelt dam. a similar and proven project, has not filled with
silt and dirt. Engineering has accomplished this; the simple process of
flushing the reservoir from the base of Its walla at stated periods carries
off all silt which may have gathered in the few preceeding months.
The Roosevelt dam receives its water from a part of the White
mountains the Mescal range, a very small area when compared to the
great mass of mountains and wide range of territory which drains into
the Gila above the San Carlos reservation.
The evaporation problem has been nothing in the life and history of
the great Roosevelt project; it will prove equally negligible at San Carlos.
Surveys, soundings for bed rock, stream measurements and other
measures necessary to determine the feasibility of the project have been
conducted by the government, and a favorable report has been handed
down.
Experiment has demonstrated that a dam 250 feet high with a storage
capacity of 560.000 acre feet, and capable of reclaiming and watering more
than 500,000 acres, is not only feasible, but is possible of accomplishment.
The Roosevelt dam was constructed for irrigation of less than 180.000
acre 3 of preferred land; but today in excess of .50,000 acres of land are
under irrigation in the Salt River valley under the project, through uti
lization of over-flow and flood watera on land not originally included in
the surveys.
Here is a project almost three times as large as the Roosevelt pro
ject originally outlined.
It will probably bring down as much scoffing and discouraging chatter
as came with construction of the Maricopa county project.
Nevertheless, it is vitally important to all Arizona.
Evaporation is bunk; .so are other discouraging arguments.
And bunk will bring Arizona nothing.
Better Jobs for Our Heroes
We are welcoming the heroes back from the battlefields. Cheer
ing crowds, much oratory, and waving flags are greeting the boys from
"over there" in cities throughout the country.
Memorials are being planned in many towns. Fountains, parks,
highways, hospitals, community centers and a myriad other plans have
been offered as a permanent recognition of the work of our soldiers.
The ideas are good. It is fit that some lasting memorial be created
to show the country's appreciation of its fighters, and the towns where
such memorials are provided will benefit, through the structures helping
build up the city.
The soldiers themselves have refrained from commenting upon tie
various plans of honoring them. But they are showing plainly the kind
of recognition they desire. Their wishes are made plain in the thou
sands of letters to the United States employment service. They all
ask for a better job.
Is not such a request reasonable? If we meant all the things we
said on thousands of platforms, reiterated through the columns of the
press, and boasted of loudly by means of posters, it is:
We said that if the war was lost, all our property would be value
less. We painted word pictures of the millions in indemnity a victorious
Germany would demand. There is no reason at this time to believe that
the estimate of the tremendous cost of such a victory by our foe was
too smalL
One poster asked: "What will our money be worth if we lose the
war?" Another inquired: "Do you love your dollars more than your
boys?"
The heroes accepted those posters at their face value. They staked
their lives and their future on their faith in their fellow-countrymen to
live up to the standard the people so loudly proclaimed as correct. Our
soldiers went away to make this a safer and better world in which
to live. , They did their work so splendidly that all the world marveled
and admired.
Are they to be welcomed back with, only mere phrases?
They are ready to take their place again in the ranks of useful work
ers. They do not ask to be supported in idleness. Neither do they
ask the huge indemnity that a victorious Germany would have exacted.
They do not ask that the land they saved shall be theirs. They are will
ing to give a full return for all they receive.
They ask simply for some direct personal evidence In their own
rase that they have made this country a better place to work, and
live in. They seek a little larger share in the wealth they helped to pro
duce, and at least, their old jobs back.
It sounds like a reasonable request.
Carnivals Ended at Tucson
All Arizona may well take example of Tucson and the Old Pueblo's
action in refusing carnivals permission to prey on its residents.
Within the past few days the city council of the Pima county seat has
placed its back to the wall and refused two traveling companies permis
sion to erect tents within the city limits. The action followed repeated
complaints on the part of business men. merchants, newspapers and
citizens.
Itinerant road fhows under canvas, carrying a few serui-legitimate
'turns' and ten times as many hazzards to the public, have long been a
detriment to the cities of this state. Their gambling devices, which would
land the average business man or citizen behind the bars, have been a
drain on every community's resources. They have come, raked the hard
coin into their racks and disappeared over right to seek out other cities
on which to prey.
They are like the lobo olf which sweeps down on the corral, kills
a calf, satisfies its thirst for blood, and goes over the hill to the next
corral to find new victims.
The Anzona cattlemen paid bi?h bounties for the scalps of wolves.
The Ftate added bounty to rid it ranges of wolves.
Arizona cities ccuM well afford to take similar preventative uietmures
to br from iln-ir limit lobos of the show gi-nio.

PHOENIX, Ariz Feb. 3. It was an
nounced at the governor's office late
today that already protests are coming
from the northern section of the state
protesting against the proposal from
the state of Utah that Arizona accert
an exchange of territory or sell to
Utah the portion of the state north of
the Grand canyon.
Governor Campbell today sent a !
communication to both houses of the
legislature enclosing the bill aiming
at the consummation of the interstate
deal which is being considered in the
Utah legislature for further informa
tion from Salt Lake City was to the
effect that a special commission ap
pointed by Gov. Simon Bamberger Of
Utah would arrive in Phoenix not later
than Wednesday to take up the mat
ter with the Arizona legislature.
Defense Council Abolished
Following the reading of the com
munication from the governor, the sen
ate moved that the executive appoint a
committee, subject to confirmation by
the senate to confer with the delega-
itinn TU. V

tion from Utah. The house also de
cided to appoint a committee to go
into tne proposed negotiations.
tne senate finished the work ot
abolishing the state council of defense
by passing the house bill to wipe out
that body and sending it to the gov
ernor for signature.
Before adjourniug at noon tili to
morrow, the senate also passed Sen
ator Buehman's measure, known as the
board of regents bill, for the Uaiver
sity of Arizona. This bill provides for
eight members, each board to remain
effective for eight, years.
It was argued before passage that
such action would lift the board of
regents above the plane of politics and
that in the past it was customary for
a board to resign whenever a new gov
ernor was inaugurated.
House emergency appropriation bills
passed by the senate and sent to the
governor for signature included one
covering the total of $4500 for the gov
ernor's office, another for $2400 for'
the office of the state auditor and
one providing 363.75 to relieve the
Arizona law library of its 1914-15 deficit.
Three New Bills
In the senate three bills were intro
duced. One, fathered by President
Johns, would provide a sum not to ex
ceed 520.000 for a bridge to be built
over Oak creek near Ccrnville post
office in Yavapai county.
A bill originating ia the appropria
tion committee and introduced in the
upper house would turn over $10,000 to
the Rocky Mountain club of New York
for the entertainment of Arizona sol
diers, sailors and marines returning
from the battle fronts in Europe.
Last week a communication from
the Rocky Mountain club, asking for
an appropriation of $25,000 for the pur
pose met with an unfavorable vote in
the house.
Would Limit Sheep Tax
The third measure which made its
fift appearance in the senate was
introduced by Senator . Campbell and
would provide a tax on the assessed
valuation of all the Eheep in Arizona
to be used by the sheep sanitary com- bell a protest to both houses of the' cattle rrovrru are receiving the ben-!

counties and would hold county super
visors personally responsible for its
collection up to an amount equal to
one-third of the levy for the county.
The house adjourned at 3 o'clock in
the afternoon till 1 o'clock tomorrow.
uuring the uay a nouse bill was
passed to regulate more rigidly the
enforcement tf the law against the is
suing and passing of fraudulent
checks.
The bill introduced by Representa
tive Kimball of Pima, providing for
assistant deputy court reporters when
needed, was passed, as was also the
measure fathered by Phillips of Man
copa. providing that in estates of $2000
or les, where there is no will, the
money go to the widow or minor chil
dren after funeral and other expenses
have been paid without the usual ex
penses of administration.
House Bill 47 Passed
House bill 47 passed, making pro
vision that boards of trustees of school
districts with 15 per cenj of the elec
tors may call elections Tor various pur
poses. The measure whose patron was Mrs.
Pauline O'Neill of Maricopa, amend
ing the law of liability of employers

be permitted to charge as a fee more
than 25 per cent of the amount of the

Mining and Financial News
8Y REVIEW
NEW YORK, Feb. 3 Although sen
timent in the financial district over
the week-end denoted a moderate ac
cession of optimism, which found its
chief expression in the market letters
of brokerage houses, today's session
of the stock exchange was apathetic
and uninteresting.
Pools furnished almost the sole in
itiative, again limiting; their opera
tions to shares of speculative charac
ter, while rails and standard Indus
trials were extremely dull or reaction
ary. Pressure was persistently exerted
against oils and several of the marine
stocks until the last hour, when the
general list strengthened under the
impetus of an inquiry for United
States Steel, which closed at a large
fractional gain.
The one specific incident of the day
was the cut in International Nickel
from 51 to 50 cents quarterly, despite
which Nickel closed at a net gain of
1 point. Sales amounted to 290,000
shares.
Foreign war flotations strengthened
the bond list, material advances being
registered by French munitions and
United Kingdom issues, while the
Liberty group eased slightly with
speculative rails. Total sales, par
value, aggregated 510,150,000. Old
United States coupon 4s lost 1 per
cent on call.
GRAIN MARKET.
CHICAGO. Feb. 3. Argentine gov
ernment decrees prohibiting the ex
port of corn bought at less than 74 4
f. o. b., did much today to lift corn
prices here. The market closed
strong. 23 to Sli net
May 51.20; to 51-20Ti
higher, with
and July
51.168 to 5116. Oats
to ITi. Oats gained 1
gained ls
to 17s- In
provisions there was a setback of 15
to 40c.
Even before the uews came that re
strictions had been placed on Argen
tine exports, the corn market here
had an upward slant, owing to unset
tled weather likely to hinder the do
mestic crop movement and to in
crease the feeling demand. The
stimulating effect was further empha
sized that all restrictions on the ex
pcrtation of coarse grain from the
United States had been taken off.
Oats ascended with corn. A big
increase of the visible supply total
failed to check the upturn of prices.
Provisions ruled weak on account
of the plentiful supply of hogs.
Corn strength, though, rallied the
market scmewhaL
COTTON MARKET.
NEW YORK. Feb. 3. Cotton closed

reach his relatives until the arrival in

FRIDAY IS ARBOR DAY
Friday will be Arbor day in the
southern tier of counties of Arizona,
under the school law, but it seems
doubtful at the present time whether
the local schools , will observe the
date. Under the Jaw it is mandatory
the Shattuck-Arizing Mining company could inhale the fumes from cooking I instruction Bhall prepare a program of
offices. food waa made yesterday by the plac-,' exercises to which all public schools
or the state must . conform. However,
it iB stated, the custom has been for
the state superintendent to prepare
his program not ia time for the south
ern tier of counties, but wfth the
northern tier in view, this observance
being set several jtreeks later, under
the law. -
Judging from the countless prepara
tions and treatments which are contin
ually being advertised for the purpose
of making thin people fleshy, develop
ing arms, neck and bust, and. replacing
ngly follows and angles by the soft
curved lines of health and beauty,
there are evidently thousands of men
and women who keenly feel their ex
cessive thinness.
Thinness and weakness i usually
due to starved nerves. Our bodies
need more phosphate than is contain
ed In modern foods. Phvainiana .Mm
there Is nothing that will supply this
deficiency so well as the organic phos
phate known among druggists as bitro
phosphate. which is inexpensive and
is sold by J. M. Ball In Bisbee and
most all druggists tinder a guarantee
of satisfaction or- money back. By
feeding the nerves directly and by sup
plying the body cells with the neces
sary phosphoric food elements, bitro
phosphate quickly produces a welcome
transformation In the appearance; the
increase in weight frequently being
astonishing.
Thia increase In weight also carries
with it a general improvement In the
health. Nervousness, sleeplessness and
lack of energy, which nearly always
accompany excessive thlnnesa, aoon
disappear, dull eyes became bright,
and pale cheeks glow with the bloom
of perfect health.
