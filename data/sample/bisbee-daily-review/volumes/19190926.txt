( to Testify Today; Few Disorders' Are Reported to Date
WASHINGTON, Sept. 25. Appear
ing as labor's first witness in the
senate investigation of the steel
strike,, John Fitzpatrick of Chicago,
chairman of the strikers committee.
declared today that an agreement by
the TJaited States Steel corporation
to arbitrate the differences with em
ployes would result in an Immediate
end of the walkout which he said now
affects 340,000 men.
Fitzpatrick's statement came after
a six hour recital before 'the senate
labor committee of the efforts to or
ganize the steel workers and of the.
conditions which led up to the strike.
Had E. H. Gary, chairman of the
board of the steel corporation,,' met
the workers' committee, the men
would not have walked out, Fitzpat
rick said, but an agreement for a con
ference now would not result in the
men returning to work.
Samuel Gompers, president of the
American Federation of Labor, and
chairman ' " of the first committee
formed to organize the steel workers,
will be heard tomorrow. On Satur
day, Wm. Z. Foster, secretary of the
workers' committee, who has been
charged by Representative Cooper,
Republican, Ohio, with spreading I.
W. W. propaganda, will be heard.
Judge Gary Is to appear next Wednes
day to present the steel corporation's
side of the controversy.
Paints Lurid Picture.
In his recital today, Fitzpatrick
painted a lurid picture of conditions
In the steel districts of western Penn
sylvania. He declared there was a
reign of bleod and iron there with
deputy sheriffs, paid "gunmen" and
Pennsylvania state constabulary . as
Its chief exponents. Murder and as
sault of steel workers were of every
day occurrence, he alleged, and In
this connection he sketched dramati
cally the story of the killing of one
woman, an organizer cf mine workers,
which occurred before the steel strike
was called.
"Do you feel that the steel com
pany officials directly ordered the
killing of this woman?" asked Sena
tor Sterling, Republican, South Da
kota. v
"Yea," Fitzpatrick responded.
"Think they had a meeting and de
cided upon murder?"
"Oh, I don't think they passed a
motion and left a record, if that's
what you mean."
Elsewhere In the steel Industry,
the witness said, striking workers
were meeting with fair treatment.

street cars late today.
WHY GARY REMAINS OBDURATE
Mr. Gary, at a dinner in !New York laBt night gave his rea
sons for refusing to meet the labor unions In an attempt to settle
the strike by arbitration. He said in part:
"Now you, as part of the general public, must approve or con
demn what I have been called upon to say. I can only say that
you who know the issues as involved, know full well that If the
strike succeeds It probably will be the beginning of an upheaval
which might bring upon all of us grave and serious consequences.
And you know that the questions involved in this strike, which Is
led by FoBter, an acknowledged revolutionist, are higher than the
Interests of the United States Steel corporation.
"We do not know what is in front of us. I am not an alarm
ist; I am an optimist. Certainly I have the good sense to speak
optimistically on pessimistic subjects and I hope it is not critical.
I hope these statements in reference to the disturbance of propa
ganda dealing with the doctrines of anarchy and Bolshevism have
been exaggerated. But there is such propaganda and there are
men, I am told, distributing literature of the I. W. W., receiving
their pay from funds sent here by Russia. We must "open our
eyes to the situation and protect oilr property and social structure
against them."
STRIKE, WITNESS

shown an Associated Press dispatch
quoting John Fitzpatrick, director
general of the steel strike, as saying
the walkout would end immediately
if the United States Steel corporation
would arbitrate differences, Elbert
H. Gary, directing head of the corpo
ration, declared in a statement to
night, speaking for himself, that he
believed the board of directors "can
not negotiate or confer with Mr.
Fitzpatrick or his associates."
Mr. Gary was shown the dispatch
while he was attending a dinner given
here today by Baron Kondon, presi
dent of the Japan Mall Steamship
company, and was asked to make
some comment. Breaking the tilence
he has maintained since the begin
ning of the strike. Mr. Gary wrote
a statement while seated at the table,
and then, calling the newspaper mm
into the hall, read it to them.
"The board of drectors of the
United States Steel corporation are1
the the representatives of nearly 150.
000 stockholders, including from CO
to 70 thousand employee. said thn
statement fWe are the servants and
are selected to represent and protect
their interests and also the interests
of all our 250,000 employes, the ma
jority of whom are not members or
labor unions.
"Moreover, I believe our corpora
tion is under great obligations to the
general public concerning the Issues
involved in the pending strike. In
these circumstances I would sot at
present assume to answer the Ques
tion propounded to me.
"However, I will say for . myself
that questions of moral principle can
not be arbitrated nor compromised,
and in my opinion such questions arv
Included in "the present unfortunate
struggle. I also think we cannot
negotiate or confer with Mr. Fitzpat
rick and his associates as union lead
ers concerning our employes whom
these gentlemen have volunteered to
represent."
After considering the steel com
pany's reply. Secretary Foster said
that the national advisory committee
had decided to notify the employes of
the Bethlehem company of Mr. Gary's
attitude and refer the matter to the
national committee for . organizing
Iron and steel workers. . . .
Mr. Foster said that the national
committee would be summoned- to
meet in Pittsburgh at ' the earliest
possible moment. He indicated that
the calling of a strike in the Bethle

day morning, September 29. was quite
probable. '

SENSATIONAL
CHARGE IDE
IN CAMPBELL
HARRIS CASE
Governor Alleges Wilie E.
Jones Under Influence of
Liquor March 30, 1917,
When He Rendered Opin
ion in Harris Case.
PHOENIX, Ariz., Sept. 25. Sensa
tional charges that Attorney Gener
al Wilie E. Jones was under the in
fluence of liquor on the night of
March 20, 1917, were filed in an af
fidavit by Gbvernor Thomas E.
Campbell in the famous Campbell
Harris case, wherein., the governor
is seeking to oust Charles W. Har
ris as .adjutant general of Arizona.
The matter arose after the filing
in the superior court by - Louis B.
Whitney, assistant attorney general
of an affidavit in which be states
that on the night in question Jones
and Will E. Ryan, the governor's
attorney, were at the executive of
fice, it being the last date when
the governor could veto bill 109,
then under consideration.
"Absolutely False"
The Whitney memorandum alleges
that Jones told the governor that If
he signed the bill It would perpetu
ate Harris in office."
The governor, in his affidavit
states that the language of the mem
orandum is "absolutely false," that
he had been advised . that Adjutant
General Harris had made the state
ment that the bill would give him a
life Job, and had consulted Ryan
about It and that Ryan had assured
him that the enactment would not
remove the governor's right to remove
move any subordinate officer. .
The affidavit then 6tates that he
asked the attorney general If the
bill would perpetuate Harris in of
fice, and was told by Jones that "if
any attempt was made to bo con?
stmo that act te guessed tbat the
attorney general's office, with the
hMp of Brother Ryan, would be
able to see that they didn't get
away with it." And that Telying on
such assurances he signed the bill.
Jones Denies Charge
The document then closes with
the statement "that deponent well
remembers the circumstances and re
members that due, to the fact that
the attorney general was then un
der the Influence of liquor he would
not have acted upon any suggestion
of the attorney general or any opin
ion given by . him except as in the
case the opinion . did concur with
that already given him by Attorney
Ryan."
When informed of the contents of
the governor's affidavit today the
attorney general was very indignant
and issued a statement in which he
says that "I am astonished that the
governor would make such a state
ment in reference to 'influence of
liquor as it is absolutely untrue."

DEBATES IN
FAVOR OF PACT
French Premier Admits the
Treaty Has Many Imperfec
fections, But Calls It "Coa
lition of Liberation."
PARIS, Sept 25. Premier Clemen
ceau delivered his long expected
speech in the debate on the ratifica
lion of the peace treaty in the cham
ber of deputies this afternoon. The
whole trend of his arguments in favor
of the treaty was that the treaty was
one of solidarity between allies, who,
united in war, must be united in
peace.
M. Clemenceau admitted that the
treaty contained many imperfections,
but said it was the culmination of
the work of "the coalition of libera
tlon," the first of its sort in the his
tory of the world, as the treaty was
the dawn of a new era. He recalled
the dark days of 1917, and declared
to the opponents of the treaty that it
a peace proposal had been received
then returning Alsace and Lorraine
to France no Frenchman would have
demanded the insertion of any other
clause, but would have accepted it.
The treaty brought back more than
the lost provinces, it placed France
on the highest pinnacle of fame and
honor and in a few years would bring
prosperity.
-Those who had spoken In the de
bate, the premier pointed out had
criticized the details of the treaty,
which must be considered accepted
or rejected as a whole, whether the
instrument was helpful or harmful to
France. The treaty was "the ensem
ble of possibilities," which was worth
what the future ruling classes of
France would make It by their labor.
The premier's effort was tremen
dous. He remained on the tribune for
more than two hours. Many times he
seemed to weaken, his voice becom
ing so low as to be almost inaudible
beyond the firBt row of government
benchea. But he waved off d vices
from all quarters of the chamber of
"rest" and doggedly continued to dis
play his Indomitable spirit. He passed
lightly over the criticism, which has
been prominent In the debate,' that
the French language Is not the offi
cial language of the treaty, saying "It
is not my fault If the English lan
guage is spoken by nearly two-thirds
of the civilized world."
The chamber apparent determina
tion to prolong the debate as long as
possible was not deterred by the pre
mier's request for a vote on the treaty
today, for, while M. Clemenceau was
speaking, several deputies inscribed
their names on President Deschanel's
list as participants in the debate.
MEXICANS WARNED
SAN FRANCISCO, Sept 25. A
large number of Mexicans who came
here from Alaska on fishing boats and
from border points, and who were said
to be seeking employment as strike
breakers In the strike of longshoremen
and .the bay and river boatmen, have
been warned by J. Garza Zertuche,
Mexican consuUhere, that they must
avoid all Buch'employment here "if
they wish to keep out of trouble."
CONTROL FOOD PRICES.
"LONDON, Sept. 25. (via Montreal.
Local control of the prices of cer
tain commodities by limiting prof
iteers Is provided for In a food order
which comes into operation Monday
next. The commodities affected are
fish, fruits and vegetables, on which
the maximum gross, profit permitted
the retailers, wjll-be 45 percent. .
WASHINGTON. Sept. 25. While
the German peace . treaty received
only brief consideration in the senate
today, outside developments indicated
that the factions were lining up for
the real fight over the league of na
tions covenant.
The outstanding feature of the day
was the, announcement by Senator
Johnson. Republican, of California.
that he would leave tomorrow for the
Pacific coast to keep up his attack
on the treaty, which waa accepted to
mean finally that his proposed amend
ment to equalize the voting strength
of the United States and Great Brit
ain would not be called for some time.
Next in public Interest was the
news that Senator Ashurst, Democrat,
of Arizona, had telegraphed President
Wilson that he would vote for ratifi
cation of the treaty, believing he
could render the country and the
rworld, he said, a great service by ac
cepting it as it is, without amend
ment or reservation.
Senator New, Republican, Indiana,
and Senator Smith, Democrat, of
Maryland, divided the debate of the
day, the former attacking the treaty
and the latter defending it and urging

alleged to have been accorded her by
two deputy sheriffs of Cochise coun

A. E. Parmer and F. W. Brown, the

alleged persecutors. To add to Miss
Berry's troubles a deputy sheriff of
Maricopa county, said to have been
intoxicated, added his mite by his
conduct toward her when he arrived
to take her to Phoenix on a charge
of passing bogus checks.
As a result of Brown and Parmer's
alleged persecutions, Sheriff McDon

had revoked Mr. Parmer's commission
as deputy sheriff, to take effect at

there. While I was there a deputy
sheriff came in and arrested me on
the Phoenix and Bisbee charges. I
offered him money to take up the
checks, explaining the circumstances.
He called up Bisbee and was tola
that it would be all right to pay the
money and the charges would be

I then paid the money to this deputy
sheriff, who took it and gave me the
receipt for It. I then went to my
room. Later the same day Mr. Par
mer came in and rearrested me, say
ing that he had called up the Mari
copa county officials and told them
that he would not act as a collecting
agency for a bunch of Jews, and told
me that I would have to spend thu
night Tn jail. He gave me back my
money and took the receipt from me.
I protested against that and offered
to pay the cost of having a woman"
attendant or guard's expense at the
hotel. He would not consent to that.
but told me finally that I could stay
at the hotel and that Deputy Sheriff
Brown would be my guard. When we
went to the hotel Brown told me that
he was under orders from Parmer ta
stay in my room all night. I protesv
ed against this, but Brown said it was
his duty. He came into the room
with me, locked the door and spent
the night in the room. The next -day
Parmer took me to Bisbee in a car
with a chauffeur by the name of
Walter Morris. As we came to the
Mexican boundary monument near
Osborne, and while the car wns run

climbed into the back seat with me
and put his arm around me, saying,
'We are going into Mexico now and
I am afraid you will Jump, out and
run away from me, and telling the
chauffeur to keep his eye in front
so as not to put us' in the ditch. He
then proceeded to, embrace me. He
subjected roe to every Indignity that
was possible and upon my protests to
his advances and refusal to listen to
his proposals he became rough. We
finally arrived in Bisbee and I was
taken to the Manhattan restaurant
on Brewery Gulch to have dinner.

advances and tried to "love-up" one
of the waitresses in the place.

ENTHUSIASTIC
MEETING HELD
By VETERANS
An eAhusiastic meeting of the lo
cal post of the American Legion waa
held last night with over 800 vets in
attendance to listen to the stirring
talks given by State, Commander
Andy Martin of Tucson, and State
Adjutant Windes of Fnoenix.
The meeting, which was a special
one, was called to aid the members in
the big membership campaign that Is
on at present for the local poat. Over
25 new members were added last
night to the roster and a complete
list of all ex-service men in the dis
trict was apportioned out to those
present, and it is hoped to have a
100 per cent membership in the dis
trict by the time or the next meeting,
scheduled to be held the 2d of Octo
ber, at Maze halL
Several fine selections were ren
dered by Hale's orchestra, which
were greatly enjoyed by everyone.
Free smokes and pler.ty of them were
an added feature of the get-to-gether
meet.
The second big dance,' under the
auspices of the local post, will be
given tonight at Warren park, and
' the public is invited. The last dance
was a great success, and the one to-
' night will be even a bigger one, ac
cording to the present outlook. Tick-
ets may be secured from any member
of the legion. The money derived,
over the expenses from the dance,
will be placed in the treasury to de
fray the expenses of. the post. It is
hoped eventually to have sufficient
funds tt secure the much coveted
' club house.
Commander Martin spoke at some

U. S. Marines Landed
To Aid , Jugo Slavs
COPENHAGEN, Sept. 23. Ameri
can marines landed from a torpedo
boat destroyer to compel the Ital
ians to evacuate Trau, Dalmatia, ac
cording to a dispatch received from
Spalato, a short distance east of
Trau.
The dispatch adds that the Ital
ians left after the inhabitants fired
on them and that Jugo-Slav troops
took over the town from the Ameri
cans. The dispatch, which is dated Sep
tember 25, says that a Jugo-Slav de
tachment began an advance towards
Trau, when the American destroyer
entered the harbor to . compel the
retirement, of the Italians. The . in
habitants of Trau then opened fire
on the Italians, who hastily depart
ed. The Italian commander and eight
men in an armored car fell into
the hands of the Slavs. In the mean
time 200 American marines with ma
chine guns, landed and took over
the armored car ant. the prisoners,
who subsequently were transferred
to an Italian ship.

which will not fade.
Draft Dodger Is

IIEI3EH SPRINGS, Ark., Sept. 25.
Bliss Aitkeuson. one of the principals
in the draft rtbistance disturbances in
this tiection in July, 1018, was con
victed of first degree murder today.
The jury fixed his punishment at 18
years in the penitentiary. He was con
victed for killing Porter Hazelwood of
Ileber Springs, member of a sheriff's
pdH.se that had gone to the home of
AiLkeson'b father to arrest the three
sons who were charged with refusing
to register for the draft. Two broth
ers of tlie convicted. Torn and Hardy,
will be placed on tr'al Monday.
SHANTUNG CONFERENCE.
TOKIO, Sept.' 25. (By The Associat
ed Press.) Japan is planning ' offi
cially to invite China to confer on
the Shantung situation after Japan
has ratified the peace treaty. This
fact was communicated to the corre
spondent today by officials, who ad
ded that Japan naturally could not.

return on' it, the official by whom
Brown was hired. The note ia as fol
lows (note the last paragraph and
the tender solicitude which Deputy
Sheriff Erown has for Miss Berry):
Douglas, Sept. 23, 1919.
Miss Berry:
The bearer, Mr. DeWitt, will
escort you to Phoenix unless dif
ferent arrangements are made.
Was very much surprised at
the treatment you received while
. on your way to Bisbee, and after
.you reached Bisbee. Hew ever, I
am helpless Jn the matter.
If you should return here in the
near future, please look me up.
Your Douglas Guard.
Kyis Called In.
Continuing, Miss Berry said: "This
man DeWitt, after he had broken into
my room, refused to leave until I
called my attorney. Mr. Sam Kyle,
the' local police officers and Deputy
tonentr Tom Foster all of whop,
treated me courteously and politely.
Mr. Foster succeeded in getting the
drunken DeWitt out of the room and
today the relapse came from the ner
vous- strain, and I broke. doxn com
pletely. I expect to leave for Phoe
nix as soon as I am able to travel in
company with Miss Ford. Sheriff
McDonald has assented to that, as
the Bisbee charge was dropped when
the: circumttances.had been explained
to ..the," merchant. The money had
been paid to makB the check goott. ' I
know that the Phoenix people,-when
they understand the case, will do like
wise. This is the first trouble I havv
ever been in. I am a good girl and
have never had such a terrible ex
perience in my life. Parmer and fce
Witt were more like beasts in their
actions than m,en,"
At this point Miss .Berry broke
down from the strain of the recital
of the experiences she had been
through and.it waa several minutes
before she could proceed with her
story to the Review man.
"My sister and I are alone in the
world -and we hare never asked any
one for a thing. We have all the
money that is necessary - to aid my
sister in trying to recover- her health,
and this experience is one that might
have happened to any one. When
three officers of the law have insulted
me and tried to place me in the light
of being .a bad woman, I can hardly
stand it. I am not seeking for pub
licity of any kind but I think that aa
a matter of simple justice these men
should have to answer for their con
duct. Mr. Kjie and the local officials
were nice to me and Miss Ford has
done everything in her power for pie.
I am intensely grateful foi their treat
ment to me in my trouble."
Public Feeling Strong.
Public opinion was strong last night
among those who had heard of the
affair and - F. W. Brown was busy
explaining his conduct in staying, in
the room with the young lady all
night despite her request that he
sleep on a cot outside of the door if
a guard were necessary:
The chauffeur, Walter Morris, when
questioned by the Review last night
as to whether he had received in
structions to keep his eyes on the
road, showed a remarkably poor mem
ory,, saying that even under Oath he
could not swear as to whether Par
mer occupied the back seat or the
front, but that he thought he was in
the back seat most of the lime.
Sheriff McDonald's action last
night in revoking the commission of
Deputy Sheriff Parmer's was regard
ed by the majority of people as an
act of Justice and one which will ro
ceive the commendation of the public
at large. Another excellent thing
would be the same treatment applied
to Mr. Brown, who has shown thai
he allows his personal feelings to
enter into his official cts. '

In the covenant the moral rorceh

Includes All Natrons.
My fellow citizens, the membership
of this great league of nations In
cludes all the great, mighty .nations
of the world. It is not going to in

Germany is not one of the great na

But all o fthe cutlers who have

tion, or having submitted it to the
consideration of the council of the
league of nations, laying before the
council all the truths of the facts, so
that the council may publish the facts
to the world.
You understand that there are six
months allowed lor the league's con
sideration of these facts by the coun
cil, and at the expiration of these six
months if they are not ready to ac
cept the views of the council in the
settlement of the dispute they wiu
still not 'go to war for another three
months. After this they submit the
differences between them to the judg
ment of the league, and just as cer
tain as they do this, my fellow citi
zens, they will probably not resort
to. war, for war is the greatest terror
in which a nation can be, for men will
know that there will be a delibera

it to the opinion of the world.

The most certain way that you can
prove a man is mistaken is by letting
all his neighbors know what he is
thinking, by letting his neighbors dis
cuss what he is thinking. You wil?
see that he will stay at home, he will
cot walk on the streets, he will be
afraid of the eyes of men unless he
can stand the bitter argument of
right and justice.
You have heard of six votes be
longing to Great Britain.' These six
votes are net in the council, they
are in assembly, and the interesting
thing is that the -assembly does not
vote. I must modify that statement u
little, but essentially it is absolutely
true. In every, matter in which the

Mrs. Parker Spent Hundreds Seek
ing Health Tanlac Restores
Her.
"My troubles have been complete
ly overcome since I commenced tak
ing Tanlac, and 1 am enjoying bet
ter health in every way than I have
for over twenty years," said Mrs.
M. Parker, who lives at 423 East
Third street, Los Angeles, Cal., the
other day.
"During that time," continued Mrs.
Parker, "I spent several thousand
dollars for medicine and treatment,
and it was just money thrown away
for I never got any relief from my
suffering until I commenced taking
Tanlac. I was practically an inva
lid for twenty years, and all my
trouble was caused from the awful
condition of my stomach. A great
part or that time I was confined
io my bed, as I. was too weak and
rundown to- be up. What little I
ate disagreed withyne, and I would
suffer terribly wita gas forming af
ter meals. Then, too, I often had
severe pains in the small of my
back, and wtuld have terrible spells
of headaches every day or so. To
make n'atters worse I. was attacked
with rheumatism in my arras and
legs, and this - caused me no end
of - pain and misery. I - was ner
vous, too, and never got a good
night's sleep. I finally reached the
point where I had given up all hope
of ever being well again.
"One day my husband suggested
that I stop taking the raedioine I
was using and give Tanlac a trial.
Then, too, several of my friends who
had been taking Tanlac gave me
tb4 same, advice, so I. jrpt a bottle
and .commenced taking it, and in a
week' time I was feeling a whole
lot belter. I have just finished my
fourth bottle now, and it is sim
plv wonderful the way I have im
proved. Why, I have actually gain
ed ten pounds already, and feel so
well and strong that I do all my
housework without the least, trou
ble. I was feeling so well last week
hat I actually did the family wash
ing, and it has been many year)
since I was able to do a thing like
that. My appetite is Tine and ev
erything I eat agrees with me per
ieeily. I sleep just like a. baby
every nit,lit and. feel rested and re
freshed when I pet up in the morn
ints. I never suffer from headaches
now. and my brck any more. In
fact, I am just enjoying fine health
in every way, and I give Tanlac

are only four or five, its vote does
not count unless concurred in by the
rpnrespnt a t ivop nf nil nf ths natlnnu
represented on the council, so thatl
there is no validity to the vote of the!
assembly unless approved of by the
United States, so that shows that the
vote of the United Sttaes is as big as
that six votes of the British empire.
I am not jealous, my fellow citizens,
but I think that is a perfectly safe
situation.
Do you think it unjust that Aus
tralia should be allowed to take part
in the debate?
How About Little Nations?
Do you think it unjust that that lit
tle nation in South Africa should be
represented? To Judge such you are
outside authorities.
Those two men who represented
South Africa at Paris were two dis
tinguished generals of the Boer army.
Those two men were two of the most
intelligent men J have ,ever met, men
wh could talk with the best oi
statesmen.
What about Canada? Is not Can
ada a good neighbor? I ask is hot
Canada more likely to agree with
the United States than Great Brit
ain? Canada has a speaking power,
and then for the first time in the
history of the world that great coun
try, India, is given a voice among the
nations of the world, and I want to
say that some of the wisest figures
at the conference in Paris came from
India.
Let us consider the facts, and we
will place the peace of the world on
the principles America has always
voted for. Let us not count votes.
When you hear an opinion you do
not count the number of people who
hold it, you ask who said it. You
weigh opinions, you do not count
them, and the beauty o fall democracy
is that every voice can be heard, ev
ery voice can have the privilege of
contributing to the final judgment.

CHICAGO, Sept. 23.' Southpaw
pitchers, who for year3 have given
way in the baseball world series
hall of fame to right-handers, this
year bid fair to prove the stars of
the championship contests.
"With the exception of one or two
years notably 1918 right handed
twirlers hav been the mainstays
of their clubs for 30 seasons and
seldom has southpaw pitching
brought the world's champion title
to any club. This year, however,

ISSUE IN THE STEEL STRIKE
I
THE STAGE has been set for the great steel strike. The uniou
leaders are ripe for it. They have been looking forward to
"Der Tag" for years. Their organizers have been in every steei.
plant of the land lining up the men and to delay the crisis longer
would play into the hands of the enemy. As the Kaiser and his
junta determined upon war, and no force upon earth could change
their minds, so the agitators and radicals in the steel men's union
have determined upon this hour for striking. With such men it 'is
useless to parley. They want this thing and they are going to get.
it. And perhaps they will cpme out of the struggle just- as the Ger
man madmen did. ' " '
The issue is clear and simple. It does not concern the question
of wages. The men in the steel plants are getting 170 per cent moro
pay than they did before the war. No class of employes engage:?
in skilled labor, no, not even the operatives of the government-run
railroads, are drawing more money for their services. In spite oi
the preposterous assertions of he union labor leaders, it is not a
Question of working conditions. There never was a time in the
history of the steel industry when the men were better treated. Judgs
Gary tells the truth and the American people know that it is the
truth from personal observation when he says that "the Unlteu
States Steel Corporation and its subsidiaries have determined, thai
wages and working conditions of their employes shall compare
favorably with the highest standards of right and justice."
The fight is over the closed shop, or "recognition," as the unions
most deceptively put it, inasmuch as the corporation has always
treated with its men and recognized their right to bargain collec
tively. Only it has not recognized the American Federation of Labor
as having any right, title or interest in the management of the com
pany's plants, and it will not correspond or discuss with an alien
organization in matters concerning Its own internal affairs.
And the reason is clear. If the American Federation of Labor
is to tell the company whom It shaH employ, whom it shall discharge
and. what wages and working conditions it shall impose, there ia
established over the key industry of the land a soviet that is con
trary to the fundamental principles of our democratic government.
Judge Gary and his associates are fighting for the preservation
of our cherished- American institutions. They are willing to close
down their great industries for the time being in order that the
constitutional right of men to life, liberty and the pursuit of hap
piness may not become a hollow mockery. They are fighting for
true industrial democracy in the interest of an enlightened public
sentiment that will some day crush the walking delegate and the
agitator under the heel of an outraged patriotism. They are fight
ing for the right of the American citizen to work where he pleases,
when he pleases and at what he pleases. They are setting an ex
ample to the cowards and time serves and lickspittles among em
ployers and newspaper publishers who have deserted their manhood
and allowed the walking delegate to push his way into their private
offices and editorial sanctums and dictate their closed shop demands.
It Is a fight to the death. It is a fight that transcends in im
portance any labor fight that has yet been waged in this country.
Upon the outcome hinges the question, "Shall Americanism or Bol
shevism .rule?" For there is no room for both philosophies of gov
ernment political or economic in this nation. It is a fight for
the great unorganized mass of American workmen who, although
greatly in the majority, have been unable to withstand the inroads of
the unions, no less than a fight for all real Americans who have
been forced into closed shop labor unions by threats of physical
violence, ostracism for wife and children and loss of employment.
DEFENDS THE ROBBERY
PRESIDENT Wilson has at last screwed up courage to talk about
the Shantung settlement in the. peace treaty. He declared that
he was not satisfied wit it. Well, it is good to' learn that at
least the President does not condone in speech, even if he d:u
condone in action, this rape of China.
But he extenuates the crime by declaring that Japan has promis
ed to give back Shantung to China. Inasmuch as Japan never toovc
territorial sovereignty over Shantung the promise is meaningless.
Japan has never promised to surrender those economical rights in
the peninsula which were Germany's and which she appropriatea
with no more shadow of title than that which a robber can give to
the property he stole.
One wonders why Japan would be so insistent upon Shantung I
she never intended to retain what she had gained there. - Notions
do not care for such concessions if they are to surrender them as
Boon as granted. The fact of the matter is China was robbed to
save Mr. Wilson's League of Nations, and if we set our seal to the
instrument that confirms the robbers in their booty we shall be
no better than they. It is the duty of the American Senate to amend
the peace treaty by providing that the province of Shantung shau
revert back to China and not be retained by the nation whose only
claim rests upon the doctrine that might makes right.
EUROPE'S ECONOMIC PROBLEM
IT IS a considerable puzzle, this thing of helping Europe to an
economic readjustment. Some persons are proposing larger im
ports of European goods as one means of restoring normal con
ditions in exchange. Another suggestion is the issuance of long
term credits to European countries.
The main difficulty about imports is that Americans have be
come pretty well satisfied with home products. The lure of the im
ported article is not what it U3ed to be. To be sure it was long the
custom of thousands of Americans to prefer imported to domestic
products, and many of the best minds and most patriotic spirits in
this country addressed themselves for years to the task of teaching
the American people that it was their duty to reverse this process,
and to prefer the American to the imported article. Step by step
the home market for American products was built up. The present
generation of American people has been pretty thoroughly trained
up ,to the. Idea that . American manufacturers, and indeed all othei
Anv&rV9 Jprrfcrqq'iP father than the imported, should be bought.
V ' ( Incidental totha ' development 'of ' the'' home I market, we ' gained
: a foreign market, too. ' American exports have rapidly risen. The
! war has' accentuated our growing advantage in - this . respect. And
i now, it appears, we have carried the patriotic process too far we
'are selling everything and buying almost nothing, and by so doing
' we are rapidly putting the outside world out of the possibility of buy
' ing anything, to the resulting disadvantnge of our own manufac
turers, business men and producers.

PEPY'S DIARY IN BISBEE
i
Sept. 25. Up betimes, after a good sleep, for I did labor hard yester
doy. To the library, where I met the Honorable Judge English, who amused
me mightily with some merry quips about politics, telling me how the re
call had died a borning, Thence to my barber, who did also ask about the
recall, and cut my ear, whereat I was wroth, and did not tip him. A letter
from my wife, who seems right glad that I am out of town .although she did
ask me for money, as has Deen her habit for many years, but I did not
send her any, as has been also my habit. Did listen to Behymer make
some cutting remarks about a theatre, and, in all truth., it seems to me that
a little perfume there would go a long way. Thence to the office, where I
found much work on my desk, also some bills. Mr. Massey, the mine inspec
tor gave me news of the mines, at which my heart was glad, as it will look
good in the newspaper Sunday. Did hear much talk about a scandal at
Douglas, but not much for the paper, as it was evil and might make a hole
in the subscription list. Had a good steak for dinner, but still complain
about the coffee, which is enough to make a man drink Posfam and be
come a Prohibitionist. Thence to bed, well content but looking for pay-day.

Turning Back the Calendar
Sixteen Years Ago Todax In Bisbee
(From the Bisbee Deily Review of September 26, 1903)
Former Delegate Marcus A. Smitn
of Arizona, speaking of the coming
renewal . of the struggle for state
hood said today: "My successor la
Congress, J. F. Wilson, will introduce
a bill in the house on the first day
of the session providing for state
hood for Arizona, New Mexico anu
Oklahoma, but I don't believe the bill
will pass as it is evident that the
Republicans do not propose to take
any chances of defeat at the coming
presidential election.
"Our people will never consent to
the consolidation of New Mexico anu
Arizona. It is a proposition from
New England to give four senator
to all that territory between the Gulf
of Mexico and the Gulf of California,
as stretch of country as long as froru
New York to Florida. We would pre
fer to remain a territory for firry
years rather than unite with Net
Mexico in this way."

STOCKS AND BONDS
NE WYORK. Sept 25. The fourth
day of the steel strike was without
material influence on the stock mar
ket aside from freauent pauses of the
ticker and confusing price changes,
which indicated a keener Interest in
the outcome of the labor controversy.
Traders seemed unable to have at
any fixed conclusion from the diver
gent claims of the opposing factions,
but the comparative steadiness of the
steels and related Issues denoted sub
stantial support at concessions.
Oils and tobaccos were eclipsed for
a time, but American Tobacco became
the foremost feature of the later deal
ings at an extreme advance of 10
points to 303, its top quotation In six
years, while Liggett and Myers and
Lorillard Tobaco which are named
with American in a proposed consoli
dation or merger, gained almost as
much.
Sales 835.000 shares.
Trading in Liberty bond swhich con
tinued firm, fell off in marked degree.
Foreign bonds eased slightly and the
general domestic list was irregular.
Total sales, $10,750,000. Old United
States bonds unchanged on call.
THE GRAIN MARKETS
CH1CAUO. Sept. 25. Indications
that this season tne new crop of corn
would move much earlier man usual
nad a pronounced bearish effect today
on the corn market Prices closed
heavy, 2 Jto 5c net lower with De
cember $1.23 to $1.23 and May
$1.20 ! to $1.21. Oats lost c and
provisions 55c to $1.20.
From the outset corn showed weak
ness, but it was tome time before the
downturns appeared to be due to any
thing more significant tiian lack of
support and to profit taking sales on
the part of recent buyers. In this con
nection notice was taken that there
had been an upturn of 12 to '14c
in the last nine days. Later evidence
accumulated that farmers were.selling
new corn more freely and at values
below the present market. There was
reports also that corn was condition
ing rapidly in all sections and that re
ceipts here would increase to a ma
terial extent before the end of Sep
tember. Oats followed corn downgrade. Sea
board demand was slow.
Provisions were weak In sympathy
with corn 'and hogs. Besides it was
that but little business had resulted
from export inquiries for lard.

BELGIAN HERO
HILL LOCATE
. IN ARIZONA
Of interest to residents of south
ern, Arizona and especially of the
Dnnel.is-Rirthpp district i.the follow
ing news item sent to the Paily;
Review by the Associated Press at
San Francisco. It concerns a young (
Belgian who is on his way to this i
part or the country to Degin me
study of mining, and who is de
clared to have been among the most
distinguished of the heroes of that
country during the great war:
"When JoBe Wagomans, 23 years
oVd, stopped here recently enroute
to Douglas, Ariz., where he will
learn mining from the ground up,
he was hailed as one of the men
most distinguished for personal val
or among all of Belgium's valiant
fighting men.
"He was only a private when he
was mustered out at Antwerp, Aug
ust 15, but he held almost enough
decorations for bravery to cover bis
entire chest. Among these are the
Belgian military medal with six lions
- and five palms, Indicating distin
guished bravery in six great battles
and meriting the cross on five sep
arate occasions; the Kerensky med
al of the ' Battalion of Death, s&id
to be the rarest military decoration
and the Yser Cross; three crosses i
of St. George, the , Russian honor
corresponding to the British victor
ia cross; .the Belgian Commemora
tive War cross, with the volunteer
crown and eight bars, and the Bel
gian Medal of Victory.
"Wagemans belongs to an influ
ential Belgian family, but said he
knew and liked many ' Americans
and chose to live in the United
"Henceforth America is my coun
try," he said, "and here I will make
my home."
MUSIC NECESSARY TO HAPPINESS,
IE!
"The men who discovered Bisbee
and planned the city built on these
hills had more nerve than any other
men in existence. As you look at
.these hills on either Bide you should
say 'Blessed be youV and then give
them the wreath while they are liv
ing rather than chiseling H in mar
ble too cold to respond." , ,,.
L. E. FJebymor of Lcs Angeles, ene
of the foremost men in the mana
gerial field of music, made the fore
going statement before the members
of the Business Men's Luncheon club
at the Copper Queen hotel yesterday
noon. Mr. Behymer Is In the district
to complete the arrangements for the
winter series of concerts sponsored
by the Musical Events club,-the first
of which is to be held 09 Novembef
24.
"The city beautiful, like the borne
beautiful, must, have its refining in
fluences," he went on to say." It
must have its books, its paintings
and -its music. The city of commei
cialism is not a city of homes .and
commercialism alone falls.
"You say that music is not a busi
ness. Go to the court house and
learn how large a, sum of money is
paid annually for taxes on pianos,
organs and victrolas. Maybe you will
say there are a lot of fools paying
out money for something which la not
business. But stop, measure the in
fluence of It.
"Two things which play a mighty
part in keeping the spirit of the men
overseas were letters from home ana
music. Every company went over the
top singing and many came back with
the Invigorating words of a song "on
their lips.
"Muale Hath Charms."
"William J. Burns, the great detec
tive, has said, 'Show me a city which
has music In its streets, in its parks
and in its homes and I will show you
a city with the minimum amount of
crime.'
"The women of the district deserve
a lot of credit Tor the work they have
done to bring the series of concerts
here this winter. Men are too busy
dealing in commodities and selling
things to make life comfortable t6
give the time to these things. But
the men who have made their pile
are beginning to find -that the. world
must have things to make life enjoy
able and to refine it. t
"It it wasn't for the women of
America there would be no America.
The women are taking care of the
children and preserving the home.
You are earning the money, to be
sure, but -without the women: life
would not be worth living. Take her
away and there would be no music
no refining Influence.
Regular People.
"These artists are regular people.
Rudolph Ganz, one of the greatest
pianists of the day, who will appear
here this winter, could put on the
gloves and box a few rounds or play
a good game of pool as easily as he
can finger the keys. Ernestine Schu
mann-Heink is a big, wholesome tm
an whose voice reaches your heart
because you feel that you get close to
her. She does not travel in a private
car; has only a drawiig room and
can find a crying baby in the train
wherever it Is and soothe It In a few
seconds. She has just -returned from
Amsterdam, bringing her two grand
children to make American citizens
of them.
"Thibaud is the greatest of all
French violinists. He comes nearer
to bejng a Frits Krelsler than anyone
la the concert fieli today. He ka

TEMPER GOOD CAUSE.
LONDON. Sept. 25. "Bad temper
is not a ground for separation If It
were, half the people in the world
would be separated at the present
time," declared Magistrate Lankester
in Thames court, when a woman ap
plied for a writ of separation from
ber husband, declaring he had "an
awful temper."

the symphony orchestras in this
country and is only 35 years old.
"Florence Macbeth Is an example
of what an American girl can do edu
cated absolutely In this country. She
is a coloratura and her voice reaches
the heart strings. And she Is Just a
natural American girl.
i Just Starting.
'This work which is beginning here
is for: your children- as well as for
yourselves. Sooner or later you will
realize that you have reached the
high school stage In your concerts
and outgrown the first things. I
would not say that jazz music has no
place, but I do say that there Is mu
sic that Is so much better than Jazs
will take its rightful place when you
have learned to appreciate.
"These artists come to you with
from 20 to 40 years of experience in
the concert field, and will give you
their best. You have learned some
thing of them from the victrola. Dont
take the victrola out of your homes
aad schools. It will help you to ap
preciate good music.
"Bisbee Is going' to put Itself on
the map as a musical city. Music
lovers In other parts of the country
are going to look at you and marvel
at your growth. And if you can see
your way clear to get a larger audi
torium within the next few years,
these aitiBts will come to you at
less price per seat because of the In
creased patronage."

H. H. Bohmfalk, city marshal at

from his young son George, who is
serving with the American army ot
occupation at Coblentz. George says
ha is having the time of his life and

chow and says he has to pay out all
his money in tailor s bills to have his
clothes enlarged.'
The case against J. D. Bauer, local
attorney who is 'noted for his de
fense of certain of the I. W. W., In
Judge Hogan's court, and who was
recently charged with disturbing the
peuce by Mrs. "Ada Harless, was
dismissed yesteriay by Judge Win
ter in Lowell after listening for . a
couple of hours 16 the petty vrranjf
lings and childish bickering on which
the charge was based.
From the evidence brought foilh
it appears that Bauer, rented lodg
ings from Mrs. Harless that adjoin
ed ber own. Lowell officers testi
fied ' that they had been called to
the place several -times in the past
to adjust relations between the par
ties involved which had become quite
venomous. f '
The first squabble was over a dog
nn her Aramiaesi Then the Har
lean faction renewed the feud by
ordering Bauer ti prevent children
in the neighbortwod rrom playing
in the vard.
The climax was reached when
Mrs. Harless returned home from
an absence and accused Bauer of
making away with' some of her fruit
jars. To this charge Bauer naive
ly remarked In court. "If I wanted
to steal anything.it would be) more
valuable than that."
Mrs. Bauer arrived on the scene
about this time and, according to
the testimony of Mrs. Harless and
her son, struck .Mrs. Harless. Mr.
Bauer admitted that while the al
tercation between the two women
was going on, he shouted. "Wipe
the . earth up with her." The pro
secution dwelt at length on .this
careless "slip of the tongue" on , the
part of Bauer, insinuating that he
had urged his wife onto the attack.
Judge Winters decided that the
wrangllngs of -the two families had
no place in aeurt and dismissed the
cae.

BERLIN. Sept.. 25. (Correspond
ence of The Associated Press.) To
conserve Berlin's coal supply a move
will be made to change the closing
hours for cafes and restaurants from
11:30 p. m. to an earlier hour not
yet decided upon. .The theaters and
restaurants will be restricted in their
use of light and Berlin will have to
expect a material restriction ' even
before the winter so that coal can be
saved.
. The railroad-service also will be
materially restricted sleeping cars
and dining cars will probably be en
tirely abolished owing to the increas
ing shortage of locomotives.
Germany is now short of 650 loco
motives, while fourteen thousand cars
are due to France. .
There seems no lack ot raw mate
rials to the railroad foundries but the
workmen cannot or will not deliver
their peace time quality or quantity
of labor. A locomotive in peace time
could be built in a week by 115 work
men. Now 213 workmen are nece8
sary to build one. :x fv ' V"
The emergency workers of Greater
Berlin have published an -appeal to
the miners ot, German urging In
creased production, since they say u
catastrophe threatens Berlin through
lack of coal, which makes it lmpos
sible to produce building materials,
notably cement.
Waterways are being aed in all
possible cases as a substitute for
steam transportation.

(Correspondence of The Associated
