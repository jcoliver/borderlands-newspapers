Bisbee SerbidIlS
Of All WOOOlieS
Meeting of Serbs and Crea
tions in Warren District
Held Here Sunday Reso
lution Passed Condemning
I. W. W.
On Sunday the Serbians and the
Croatians of the Warren district as
sembled and discussed the conditions
and circumstances which arose in Bis
bee on account of the present strike.
The meeting, held under the direction
and must only think of and work for
the common interests of this country;
therefore, we believe that In these
times and circumstances a patriotic
and loyal workingman must not un
dertake any steps which brings the
interests of this country and its In
dustrial and military preparedness
into jeopardy, or delays them. We are
especially happy to adopt this opinion
because of the additional fact that the
Interests and success of this country
in this war are closely connected with
the success of the aspirations and lib
erty of our people In Europe.
Third Being fully convinced that
we are sincerely expressing a truth,
and being without fear that anyone
can successfully accuse us of having
other, dishonest motives, or partiality,
we emphatically declare that we were,
and are now satisfied with the condi
tions under which we have worked,
are working now and desire to work
In the future in the mines of this dis
trict of Arizona. We are acquainted
with the conditions under which work
ingmen of our class are working else
where In this country, and, therefore,
we can with more positiveness assert
that, under the circumstances, our
I conuiuons nere were sausiaciory, ana
that. In that regard, we had no rea-
Bon, nor have any, to complaint, and
still less to go on strike, or to sym
pathize with it,
Fourth We positively assert and
declare that we have not, nor Intend
to adhere nor to sympathize with the
i principles of an organization known
under the name of Industrial Work'
ers of the World. In general, or with
the actions of said organization in the
Warren district in particular. We do
not regard such organization as a rec
ognized labor organization, and we do
not consider their leaders as labor
leaders but as enemies of true labor
Interests, and now also as enemies of
thi country, its interests and its uc
cess in this war.
Fifth In regard to the disturbances
wWch aroge here on account of tne
recent strike, and in regard to the
measures adopted by the citizens of
this town to put a stop to said disturb
ances, we declare that we emphatical
ly condemn said disturbances and
thr Pronator.; the measure adopt
ed by the citizens we regard as a "war
measure" which the citizens, accord

were obliged to adopt, and we believe
that In that action of theirs they were

Accompanying the proclamation wan
a i statement from the president ex
plaining its purposes. It said:
Export Control.
"The purpose and effect of this proc

merely export control. It is not the
intention to Interfere unnecessarily
with our foreign trade, but tour own
domestic needs must be adequately
safeguarded and there is the added j

German government. After these needs
are met it is our intention to minister
to the needs of the neutral nations as
far as our resources permit. This task
will be discharged without other than
the very proper qualifications that the
liberation of our surplus profits shall
not be made the occasion of benefit
to the enemy, either directly or indi
rectly. Two Lists Prepared.
"The two lists have been prepared
in the interests of facility and exped
iency. The first list applicable to the
enemy and his allies and to the neu
tral countries of Europe brings under
control practically all articles of com
merce, while the second list applicable
tV all the other countries of the world
makes only a few additions to the list
of commodities controlled by the proc

"It is obvious that a closer super
vision and control of experts is nec
essary with respect to those European
neutrals within the sphere of hostili -
ties than is required for those coun -

"The establishment of tUis distinc

our policy of minimizing the Interrup

Cloture Rule Possible
Petitions for cloture which tonight
had more than 50 senators' signatures

sent to fix a date for final voting. Sev
eral senators signed with the under
standing that the cloture rule would
not be sought unless a filibuster de

Proa and Cons
In today's debate on the postage
taxes. Senators Hardwick, Pomerene
and McKellar led the attack on the
bill's provisions advocating higher
postal rates for newspapers and maga
zines. Senators Harding, Smoot, Mc
Cumber and others opposed higher
postage rates, while Senators Borah,
Townsend and others urged entire
elimination of postage taxes from the
bill.
Committee Defended
Senator Jones of New Mexico de
fended the action of the committee
! in levying a postal tax. He declared
the committee had no intention of ad
justing second-class postage rates, but
acted purely with the intention of
raising as much revenue as possible.
Action Condemned
The committee's action was denoun
ced by Senator Townsend who declar-
ed there are thousands of articles that
could have been taxed to bring In the
same revenues without imposing such
hardship. He also said the proposed

Head of Japanese Mission to
United States Defines the
Attitude of His Govern
ment to All Allied Nations
(By Review Leased Wire)
WASHINGTON, Aug. 27. Vlsc'ount
Ishii, the special Japanese anibassa
gave to the Associated Press tonight
a statement detiningine purposes oi
his mission to the United States. Mem
bers of the mission onticed at Hono
lulu, at San Francisco and finally here
in Washington indications that their
coming might be misinterpreted by
certain elements and it was felt neces
sary to explain that no commercial 'jr
selfish Interests were to be subserved.
The anibasnador's statement follows:
Two Reasons.
"The Imperial Japanese mission
came to the United States for two rea
sons. First, to convey to the president
and the American people the apprecia
tion and congratulations of the emper
or and the nation of Japan for the en
trance of the United States into the
war as allies of Japan and the other
nations now waging war against the
enemies of freedom; second, to deter
mine bow best to cooperate with the
United States in carrying 'on the war
to a triumphant conclusion.
Japan Unselfish.
"Having determined in what manner
Japan can use her resources and
strength to this end, it is the purpose
of the mission to further aid the allied
cause by showing what she can do
with the help and cooperation of the
United States. Japan is entirely un
selfish in her aim. We are fighting for
a common end and we wish to aid in
the common efforts."
No Ulteri r Motive.
In the case of ships made from steel
supplied by the United States assur
ances are to be givent that they will
be for allied use alone and will not be
employed for Japanese commercial
purposes after the war. These confer
ences will begin this week.

COMMERCIAL CLUBS
WILL AID BIG LOAN
Various Organizations in the
County Are Asked to Aid
Nation in Floating Second
Loan
Again the American people are ask
ed to "do their bit." The Treasury
Department has notified the Commer
cial club that Secretary McAdoo is
about to announce the second Liberty
1 oun of 1917, and the club has been
requested to urge upon everyone the
necessity of saving for it.
The allies have got to win the war,
and to do so the government must be
furnished with the money necessary to
do its part. It is up to the nation to
'come across" and hasten the advent
of peace by making the second loan,
like the first, an overwhelming suc
cess. So save! When the second
loan Is announced help the men who
are going over to fight by buying one.

DOUGLAS CIVILIAN
TEAM LOSES TWICE
TO LOCAL PLAYERS
C. & A. Tossers and Junction
Briggs Team Trounce Visi
tors Sunday Afternoon; Lxm
. cats nave Edge in Lvery
Department
The Douglas Civilian team returned
home after the Sunday's game a sadder
and wiser crew sadder, because they
had received the short end of two de
cisive scores; and wiser to the extent
that they were clearly shown the fu
tility of a team attempting to play
baseball with five substitutes in the
line-up. That number of the Douglas
regulars failed to perform.
In both games the visitors were
clearly outplayed. In the first they
didn't have much chance to show off
at bat, Cotiiran, the C. & A. pitcher,
easing them down by striking out ten
men and permitting but one hit. Both
of their runs were unearned, coming
on Janssen's three errors in the fourth
inning. The C. & A. players stole bases
at will on Gomez, whose throws were
weak ana umccuiraie.
Between games a loving cup was ex
hibited, w.ich Is to be presented to
die team which leads the league when
the season winds up. It is the gift of
Sol Voigenstein of Lowell.
In the second . game Douglas started
jff impressively, gathering five hits in
e first two innings. Stupid base run
ning by Parmeter robbed them of at
.east one run in the first inning, when
,ie loafed on Campbell's long waliop to
r.gbt field. For the remaining five in
12S Waldschmidt held them well In

Band Gets Ovation From
Spectators
At Naco( on Sunday afternoon, there
was the usual band concert and the
usual number of automobiles and the
usual crowd of people. And at the end
of each selection there was the usual
amount of applause.
But in the midst of a medley of fa
miliar airs the band broke into the
strains of "Dixie", and the people
who were there didn't wait with their
applause until the band bad finished
playing. Instead, they did what peo
ple always do when they hear that
song of the southland; they cheered.

"Dixie"' Lrin6s applause; and here in
Arizona it is cheered also lustily.
Over in France today the "Sammies"

RESENT CRITICISM.

taking vigorous exception to the asser
tions of writers In foreign countries
that Japan is taking but an lnconse
quental part in the war.
The Herald of Aasia, notably, em
phasizes lite Importance of Japan's
assistance to the entente allies, espe-!
j daily on the sea. and add; "Those
who fancy that Japan is a sleepiny
partner in the war are doing us on
injustice. What is, however, most
important for those discussing Ja
pan's contributions to the common
cause to remember Is the probable
consequences of Japan's refusal to
join the entente powers. Such a de
cision on our part would probably have
been sufficient to turn the scale irre
vocably In favor of the Teutonic pow

George D. Conger, resident of the

county being saddled with the expense
of deporting the 1200 men who were
sent out of Bisbee on July 12. Con

""-"" A study of the British casualty lists for the last week,
which covers most of the fiercest fighting in Flanders and
before Lens, shows that about 2800 were killed and about
11,000 wounded and taken prisoner. There are 325 offi
cers among the dead on the field of battle and 846 among
the wounded and missing. The British ocer, all honor
to him! Never, In all the glorious traditions for bravery
in the British army, has he been as brave as in this ter
rible world war. Young noblemen and squires and sons
of rich and' famous men have died by the thousand in
France at the head of their men. Heroes, all of them.
Not even in the days of Edward of England when Sir
John Chandos led the English knights in France in the
Hundred Years war, has the English nobleman won great
er fame in that world-old game where the stake is death.
The Ypres salient, won this month in its entirety
by the British from the Prussian invaders, will go down
in history as the bloodiest spot, and the most hallowed
In all the world, excepting only the summit of the Hill of
Calvary. One hundred thousand English lie buried here,
the crosses being set up over their graves directly after
the first battle of Ypres, when the German artillery dom
Inatd the British rifle fire. Many thousands of French
men and Belgians also sleep in this spot. After two years
of occupancy by the Hun It has been taken by the allies
and every foot of it is seeped with German blood. A
quaint little old Belgian village, with its churches, now
in ruins, and the sad memory of its old, old houses and
halls and trim streets; and just beyond a piece of meadow
land, laid out like a triangle with Ypres as its base. To
England and to France, mortal enemies for one thousand
years, it will be a holy spot forever. Their bravest sleep
there, but their sacrifice united these great nations in a
deathless compact
Yesterday was "Casualty Day" in the annals of Am
erican history. That is, it was the day upon which the
casualty column was started in the official bulletin. It
has a deadly significance. It means that the time Is at
hand when American troops are to go into the fighting
line and death and disablement may reasonably be expect
ed at any time. There were no casualties in yesterday's
bulletin and it was so stated therein, but the fact that
buch a bulletin service has been inaugurated causes a
thrill to go to every American heart For the first time
In 50 years the casualty lists upon the bulletin boards
are to have a grim message for thousand upon thou
sands of homes. In the Spanish war the killed and
wounded were numbered by hundreds, and therefore it
hardly counts. Only a few states were represented upon
the firing line in that struggle. But now we are upon
the dgc of a killed and wounded list that may well
eclipse the bloodiest battles of the great Civil war. A
steady stream of soldiers will be sent abroad from now
on until the end of the war. American troops win have
to go "up and over" by the thousand before the Prussian
is decUi ely defeated.
PACIFISTS FOR GERMANY ONLY
(Kansas City Star)
The pacifist who wrote to Secretary Redfield ap
pealing to him to support the La Follette peace resolu
tion got a reply that would change the pacifist tune if
pacifists were smart This particular pacifist made the
same mistake they all make, and Secretary Redfield point
ed it out to him not kindly.
"No humane note rings in your letter," the secretary
wrote. "No pity for slaughtered nations shows in It.
But you have an excuse for Germany.'
No pacifist has yet been found who was smart enough
to conceal the fact that he was for Germany and against
America. That is where they all stumble and fall over
their own feet They are not for peace for the sake of
peace, but for the sake of Germany, They are not against
the conscription law because they fear for American in
stitutions, but because they fear what it will do to Ger
many. They are not against the war because they abhor
the thought of American blood being shed, but because
they know It means the doom of German autocracy. Like
the pacifist who wrote to Secretary Redfield, they all
speak with a voice that Is not the voice of America.
Those pacifists who were honest haters of war who
were Americans closed up shop when America became a
belligerent They made their fight against war, but when
war came they remained Americans. Those who were
not against war, but merely against war with Germany,
remained open for business, but not as Americans. They
are, Instead, allies of Germany in America. They fought
to keep America unarmed for the struggle. They con
tested every step the nation took to make its strength
effective. They opposed the enactment of every war
measure at every step and tried to obstruct their opera
tion when they became laws. When they failed to keep
America out of the war and failed to keep it from arm
ing when it went in they began a propaganda for a pre
mature peace that would leave German militarism's
sword unbroken and ready for the next war.
These are the kind of pacifists that are now making
the noise in America. They betray themselves every time
they open their mouths. They are pleaders not for peace,
but for Germany. They are not for Belgium, nor for
devastated France, nor for free Russia, nor for imperiled
America, nor for democracy they are for Germany.
BRYAN ON WAR
William J. Bryan, father of the present-day pacifists,
has revoked somewhat from his original stand. His fol
lowers in congress and upon the street corners of th-
cities would do well to follow his example. Here is the
latest declaration upon the war from the great disciple
of peace:
"Before our nation enters a war it is perfectly proper
to discuss the wisdom of going to war, but the discussion
is closed when congress acts," the editorial said. "We
must stand together and fight it through. There are only
two sides to a war every American must be on the side
of the United States."
Trial by Jury is announced for Russia. Miracle of
miracles for this land of serfs and slaves. How strange
it is, when one stops to consider it .that a people living
on the western edge of Europe (the English) should have
wrested the right of trial by jury from their rulers in the
early part of the twelfth century and that 800 years
should elapse before a people living on the eastern edge
cf Europe should be able to wrest this same blessed por
tion of Justice from the powers set over them by circum
stance and might at the beginning of the national exist
ence. English yeomen have always been made of stern
and rugged stuff. English noblemen have always been
jealous of the power of kings. Between them they won
the magna charter from King John at a time when kings
were supreme all over the world. Our American gov
ernment and institutions are a heritage from the rude,
strong, liberty-loving yeomen and bowmen of old Eng
land of the Golden Days. It is a grand gift, and grandly
have we used it in this land. And now, after looking
across Europe wistfully for eight centuries at the rights
enjoyed by the Briton, the poor Slav is struggling and
realixing under the Intoxicating draught
William J. Bryan was the leading pacifist of th!s
country a year or more ago, and he was berated by all
good Americans for his four-flushing and his yellow streak.
But Bryan was a Caesar leading the Roman legions on
to conquest compared to the breed of pacifists that have
sprung up In his place. A few writers and a few lecturers
and a few congressmen and a few Socialists have taken
up the work begun by the Nebraskan and they have gone
further than he ever dreamed of going. Most of their
followers are recruited from the ranks of the German
Americans and the anarchists of the same type that

AND TH'E DOG CAME BACK.
Here's a dog story with a moral,
from The Horton Headlight:
A Horton dog accompanied the fam
ily to church last Sunday and panted
and scratched and made so much
noise the congregation had difficulty
hearing the services. The sexton
kicked the dog out several times, but
he always came back. Which, observ
es The Headlight, illustrates one great
difference between a dog and a man.
If you kicked a man out of church he
would be so mad be wouldn't come
back for ten years!
And at that. The Kansas City Star
adds, "He'd lick the sexton!"

wilder flights of imagination about
plans for an organized revolt. Before

be firmly convinced that all that would

would be for a leader to rise and that

Council at Last Night's
Meeting '
An anti-picketing ordinance, intro
duced at hist night's council meeting
by Bassett Watkins, was passed with
lour votes in its favor. The ordinance
provides a punishment by fine of not
more than one hundred dollars or less
than twenty-five dollars, or punishment
by imprisonment of n"ot more than fifty
or less than twelve days for intimidat
ing or threatening any person at work
or seeking work, or for preventing any
person from trading with any place of
business. Davidson, Watkins, Walsh,
and Lloyd voted for its passage, while
Delbridge and Foudy did n'ot vote.
An interesting debate took up a good
part of the evening on the subject of
twenty-four inches. The acceptance
of a bid on a new Kelly-Springfield
truck for the city was objected to by
J. J. Bowen and Thorlief Olsen, rep
resenting respectively the Velie and
Mack trucks. The specifications re
quired a 120-inch wheelbase, and the
Kelly-Springfield was tile only car Vm
which a bid could be made. After con
siderable discussion, the council re
jected this bid and decided to re-advertise
for a truck without specifying
the wheelbase. Bids were acceptefi

Interpertation
of Existing Law
Asked by Wilson
(By Review Leased Wire).
WASHINGTON, Aug. 27. An in
terpretation of existing laws which
will define clearly the government's
power to keep war prices dowa has
been asked of Attorney General
Gregory by President Wilson. The
president particularly wishes to know
how far the government can go uiner
the food control and the national de
fense acts.
The defense act authorizes the exe
cutive in time of war or other nation
al emergency to commandeer supplies
at fair prices but doubt has existed as
to the allies and to the general public
at the same figures obtained by the
government.
Under the food control act the pres
ident has fixed coal prices and has
wide authority over the production
and distribution of foodstuffs but pro
visions of the act designated to give
the government control over "neces
saries" never have been clearly de
fined in the minds of many officials.
The president has emphasized that
heavy American and allied govern
ment purchases will not be permitted
to forecast prices to the private buy
er. With the price of coal disposed
of for the time being the government
has turned its attention to steel and
copper. If a test comes between the
government and industries over the
avowed intention of the government
to see that the public shares in price
reductions, it will come first over
EteeL There is belief in some circles
that most of the industries can be
controlled through the government's
control of fuel. Since ths is the basic
commodity, it is urged, a licensing sys
tem could be used to force manufac
turers to sell at fair prices on the
certainty that they would lie denied
coal if they did not comply.

HOUSTON, Tex., Aug. 27. The city
council adopted a resolution today
providing for an investigation 'of the
disturbance last Thursday when sev
enteen persons were killed as a result
of indiscriminate shooting by 100 ne
groes of the Twenty-fourth infantry.
A board of inquiry was appointed by
Acting-mayor D. M. Moody - and the
Investigation is expected to get under
way toiu'orrow.
A telegram has been addressed to
Washington asking that Major K. S.
Snow, who commanded the negroes be
kept here long enough that he might
appear before the board of inquiry.
Major Snow will be asked about a
statement he made while the shooting
was going 'on in the negro camp that
he did not nave a gun, although there
had been evidence much earlier that
trouble was impending. He will be
closely interrogated regarding steps
he took to prevent trouble.
The resolution providing for the in
vestigation says charges that Houston
police had improperly dealt with the
negrt) soldiers, that negro Citizens had
assisted the negro soldiers in their
rioting, and that intoxicating liquors
were carried into the negro camp, will
be completely gone into.
Auto Bandits Are
Jailed at Socorro
(Bv Review Lea sea Wire)
SOCORRO, N. M., Aug. 27. Charg
ed with the attempted hold-up which
resulted in the death of Paul McQueen
of El Paso, Joseph Darnell of Phoenix,
Ariz., and Z. H. Hayworth, also of
Phoenix, were in the county jail here
tonight
The men were captured by Deputy
Sheriff Robert Lewis three miles from
the scene of the attempted hold-up
Sunday and brought to Socorro today.
They had been living in a cave with

got water from a near-by spring. The
attempted hold-up took place 80 miles
west of Magdalena. The two faced
McQueen and his three companions
when their automobile had been
brought almost to a stop by another
machine which stood across the road,
and ordered them to get out S. M.
Wilson, one of McQueen's compan
ions, opened fire with a rifle and one
of the men returned the fire, fatally
wounding McQueen. Wilson's gun
jammed and the two men escaped.
Hayworth was wounded In the right
shoulder. The bullet passed through
his body. His condition is not ser
ious, however.
Wilson's Reply
to Pope About
Ready for Wire
(By Review Leased Wire). '
WASHINGTON, August 27. Signs
were in evidence today of the dispatch
of President Wilson's reply to the
peace proposals of Pope Benedict at
an early date. Oflicials freely con
ceded the probability of the early
completion of the nomination indicat
ing that the president and Secretary
Lansing have at least agreed upon the
basic features of the reply. It is un
derstood that rough drafts of some of
its important points have already been
prepared.
So far no authorized statement has
teen forthcoming as to the nature of
the reply. Officials even deprecate
speculation concerning it and there
has been a formal denial of a publish
ed report that. Secretary l-ansing had
informed some of the entente diplo
mats that Pope Benedict's proposals
would be rejected. No official opin
ions exists that the proposals will be
accepted, but in diplomatic practice
there is a wide field of discussion be
tween the two extremes of reflection
and acceptance.

GAS
The process of heating water for domestic purposes has been revolutionized in the past
few years through the introduction and perfection of gas fired water heaters, until today
it is no longer a problem to secure an abundance of hot water quickly and economically
in any dwelling, large or small.
Today, in the countless thousands of homes where gas fired water heaters are in
stalled, an abundance of hot water is available for any purpose. By some types of heat
ers the water is heated instantly at the turn of a faucet, by others, within a few min
utes after lighting the heaters, and all without labor, inconvenience or discomfort, and
at a reasonable cost for gas.

(By Review Leased Wire.)
NEW YORK MARKETS.
NEW YORK. August 27. Part of
last week's late rally in the stock
market was surrendered today, the
bears again assuming an aggressive
position on the continued uncertainty
attending government price control.
United States Steel reacted from
122 to 120. sloslng at 120. a net
loss of to one point Other equip
ments and war Issues as a whole also
pursued an uneven course and rails
soon parted with their moderate gains
of the first hour.
Shippings and tobaccos furnished
much of the days stability, mariaes,
Atlantic Gulf & West Indies, as well
as United Cigar Stores and Tobacco
Products, advancing one to two and a
half points. These gains were sub
stantially reduced or wholly lost, how
ever. In the drooping trend of the lat
er, dealings, the list closing with a
heavy tone.
Total sales, 295,000 shares.
Impending payments to the Liberty
Loan and the next offering of treas
ury certificates accounted for the 3
per cent call money rate and the great
er scarcity of time accommodations:
The bond market was irregular on
limited trading. Liberty 3's holding
steady at 99.90 to 99.96. Total sales,
par value, aggregated $1,945,000.
United States bonds, old issues, were
unchanged on call.
GRAIN MARKET.
CHICAGO, August 27. Fear of
frost In the northwest did much to
strengthen corn prices today after lib
eral offerings had taken away an Ini
tial rally. The market closed strong
and near the top one to 1 cents
higher with december at 109 to 109
and May at 106.
Oats closed strong cents to 7g
cents higher and provisions finished at
an advance of from three to 30 cents
final figures being at the top for the
day. '
The wheat pit was silent; trading
In futures having ceased with the last
sale Saturday. Cash wheat was
somewhat easier but traders were
awaiting the price terms fixed ty the
government.
Country offerings of oats were not
impressive, holders showing reluctance
to dispose of their lines. Threshing
returns showed large yields and cash
sales aggregated 225.000 bushels.
Advances in live hog prices gave
strength to provisions and leading sel
lers of last week bought freely. Lard
was in good demand. The list closed
at top figures for the day.
COTTON.
NEW YORK, August 7. The cot
ton market today closed irregular at
a net advance of four to eight points.
NEW YORK. August 27. Declines
were recorded in practically all issues
today with liquidation In some of the
so-called specialties like Texas Oil,
American Steel Foundry and Republic
Steel more pronounced.
There was nothing in the days
news to change the convictions of
those bearishly inclined and in the
more conservative circles the tenor of
advice is along the lines of cautioning
against purchases under the present
uncertainty of things in general.
Sentiment is still under the influence
of the price fixing and taxation pro
gram and until disclosures of a more
conservative meaning are rendered, it
is mofe than probable that holders of
industrial shares will show a willing
ness to reduce commitments.

RUMANIAN KING VID HOSTS
OF 'AMERICAN GENERAL AND AIDS
WHEN THEY V!S LITTLE, KINGDOM
General Hugh L. Scott Finds People of Rumania in Hearty
Accord With the Ideals of Western Nations German
Propagandists Have Made No Headway in Kingdom
Big Reception Is Tendered the Americans During Their
Stay in Jassy
JASSV, Rumania, Aug. 27. (Cor
respondence of The Associated Press)
Rumania, all that is left of the little
kingdom, two-thirds of which lies un
der the Prussian heel, gave Major Gen
eral Hugh Scott, the American chief or
staff and member of the American
mission to Russia, a royal welcome
when he and his aides visited this lit
tie provincial city in Moldavia, which
has been converted into an Improvised
capital.
The king and queen, all the mem
bers of the council, the chief of staff
and the entire parliament joined in
greeting General Scott, who carried a
message from United States Senator
Elihu Root extending the sympathy of
the American diplomatic mission and
all the American people to brave little
Rumania, which has never complained,
never talked of separate peace in spite
of the loss of her most fertile lands to
the Austrians and Germans and the
hardships 4,000,000 of her people arc
enduring under German oppression.
Queen Marie and King Ferdinand en
tertalned the American general and his
party at luncheon in the simple resl
dence which serves as the imperial
hbrne in the war capital. The queen
wore a white nurse's costume, with a
red cross on her breast and the white
veil all the Rumanian nurses use as
a headdress when on active service.
Similar costumes were worn by her
two daughters, the attractive young
princesses. King Ferdinand wore the
fatigue uniform of a general officer,
and his son, . the 12-year-old prince,
was dressed in a boy scout's suit
The drawing room in which the t'oy
al family received the American offi
cers w,as stacked high with Yed cross
supplies. There were evidences every
where of war preparation. News of
the successful Russian advance at
Tarnopol two days before had relieved
anxiety as to conditions along the Rus
sian front and the imperial family dis
played the same eagerness to resume
hostilities that is displayed by every
Rumanian peasant
German propagandists have made no
headway in Rumania. The little coun
try has been greatly encouraged by
America's entrance into the war and
awaits American material-aid for the
trained and experienced army of near
ly a quarter of a million men who are
keen for revenge and eager to strike.
The Rumanian parliament greeted
the American representatives in a
small theater which serves as the seat
of the legislative body. Premier Bra
tiano. Take Jonescu, leader of the con
servative party, F. Porumbara, presi
dent of the senate, and many tther
leaders delivered addresses of welcome
in which they affirmed Rumania's in
tention to defend Its rights and con
tinue the war as long-as a single man
is able to fight.
The representatives of the American
mission, the American charge, Mr.
Jflckson, and Rumanian speakers, were
seated on the stage of the theater
which was elaborately decorated with
flags of all the allies. The members
of parliament and representatives of
various military and civic organiza
tions crowded the auditorium of the
theater.
Your presence Is a manifestation of
the brotherhood of arms which makes
us happy and proud in the midst of our
trials and suffering. In the unequal
struggle with an enemy which has set
back for many centuries the concep
tion of relations between belligerents."
said Mr. Bratiano. "Rumania upholds
the justice of its position and will not
alter its decision at any cost That
decision cannot find stronger encour
FLLET IN THE WANING
agement than the participation in ths
struggle of the moral and materal
forces of the great republic of the new
world which places its ceaseless ener
gy, its high character, its justice and
its American genius at the service of
humanity. This particpation is a guar
antee of final peace, a fountain of
peacefull progress.
"Rumania will find in the principles
of justice and liberty the conditions
necessary for Its legitimate develop
ments, thanks to the union of the Ru
manian people up to this time cruelly
oppressed by Austro-Hungary, and pre
vented from enjoying a national life In
conformity with their own civilization,
aspirations and interests.
"Our actual association in arms, the
dangers which we face together, the
great duty, for the accomplishment of
which we shall contribute each accord
ing to his means, will establish be
tween us and the great republic a
btmd of greater value than we can es
timate, for It will constitute between
our countries an undying friendship
which peace will strengthen and de-
; velop."
; General Scott's reply to the welcome
i of the Rumanian leaders-was frequent
ly interrupted by applause. The Am
erican officer spoke in English and his
address was translated into French by
Colonel T. B. Mott After thanking
, the Rumanians for the cordial recop
tibn extended to the American delega
tion General Scott said:
"We have come with a message from
the other side of the ocean to assure
; you of American brotherhood. Ani
. erica admires you profoundly and has
high regard for the courage with which
you have endured the recent trying
I m'onths. We realize in America, all of
; us, the danger which threatens you
' and us. We have no financial nor
! commercial aim. We enter this war to
I maintain right and 'justice.
! "America intends to stand by your
side, and by the side of all our allies,
until the end, and extends to you Its
' most profound sympathy. She desire3
' to aid you in every way. We received
from your ministers and officers a
i statement fef your most urgent mili
tary necessities. Our mission will in
sist with all its strength that your re
quests be granted. We are happy to
find you so courageous and determin
ed. We go to battle with you on all
fronts, until the time when the liber
ties of all nations, small as well as
large, shall be safeguarded."
General Scott and his party, which
consisted of Colonels R. E. L. Michie
and W. V. Judn and Lieutenant Col
onels F. L. Parker and T. B. Mott, were
entertained while in Jassy at the pal
ace of the archbishop. They were able
to remain only one day because of the
necessity for their immediate return
to Petrograd to join the American mis
sion on Its homeward trip.
"LESE-MAJESTE."
The appeal filed by Paikichiro Tag
awa, formerly house parliamentary un
der secretary to the department of
justice and a member of the house of
representatives of Japan, accused of
a lese-majeste, has been rejected pt
the Tokio Court of Appeal.
Mr. Tagawa was sentenced to five
months' imprisonment and fined $!r.O
In the court of first Instance for writ
ing an article In which he attacked the
Genro, or elder statesmen for Inter
ference In the last ministerial chunge.
The article was Interpretpd by the ju

PROTECTING RUSSIAN BISON.
Kartsoff, former master of the
hunt for Emperor Nicholas, who now
administers the formerly imperial do
mains at Gatchina, the residence of
the Dowager Empress Marie, has tak
en measures to prevent the destruction
of seven surviving aurochs, the only
European bison now know with cer
taint to exist in Russia, Until lately
a large herd was maintained in Nich
olas vast forest at Bieloviesh. White
Russia, ten from which were sent to
Gatchina before the war.
When the Germans occupied Bielo
viesh they killed and canned hundreds
of aurochs. It is not known if any
survive at Bieloviesh but, before the
killing two were presented to the
Stockholm Skansen park. After the
revolution, the Gatchina populace or
ganized an aurochs hunt, considering
the beasts "imperial" and therefore,
fair game. They killed three. M.
Kartsoff's measures aim at preserving
the remainder.
CHURCH BELLS AND CANNON.
About 70,000 church bells, destined
for the smelter and ultimately for con
version into munitions of war, have
been received by a big bell foundry at
Apoldo, in the Prussian province of
Hanover.

1 & Irf
correct in every detail lovely to write on and just what you need
for thepurposc When this happens to you remember This is the

LEMONS BRING OUT
THE HIDDEN BEAUTY
Make this lotion for very little
cost and just see
for yourself.
nai girl or woman nasnt' heard
of lemon juice to remove complexion
blemishes: to bleach the skin and to
bring out the roses, the freshness and
the hidden beauty? But lemon juice
alone Is acid, therefore irritating, and
should be mixed with 'orchard white
this way: Strain through a fine cloth
the juice of two fresh lemons into a
bottle containing about three ounces
of orchard white, then shake well and
you have a whole quarter pint of skin
and complexion lotion at aLVmt the
cost one usually pays for a small jar
of ordinary cold cream. Be sure to
strain the lemon juice so no pulp gets
into the bottle, then this lotion will
remain pure and fresh for months.
When applied daily I'o th face, neck,
arms and hands U should help to
bleach, clear, smoothen and beautify
the skin.
Any druggist will supply three
ounces of orchard white at very lit
tle cost and the grocer has the lemons.
