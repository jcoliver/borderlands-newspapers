(By Review Leased Wire)
WASHINGTON. July 4. From the
shadows of Washington's tomb, Presi
dent Wilson today offered America's
declaration of independence to the
peoples of the world with a pledge
that the United States and its allies
will not sheathe the sword in the war
against the central powers until there
is settled "once for all" for the world
what was settled for America in 1776.
Foreign born citizens of the United
States, thirty-three nationalities, wno
had placed wreaths of palms on the
tomb in token of fealty to the princi
ples laid down by the father of his
country, cried their approval of his
words in many languages and then
stood with reverently hared heads
whlie the voice of John McCormack
soared over the hallowed ground in
the notes of "The Star Spangled Ban
ner." "Washington and his associates,
like the barons at Runnymede,
spoke and acted, not for a class,
but for a people," the president
said. "It has been left for us to
see to it that it shall be under
stood that they spoke and acted,
not for a single people only, but
lor all mankind.
"There can be but one issuo.
The settlement must be final.
There can be no compromise.
"What we seek is the reign of
law- .based upon the consent of the
government and sustained by the
organized opinion of mankind."
The speaker's crisp words as he em
phasized the least which America will
consider as a basis for peace were in
terrupted by a tumult of applause and
words of approval. The demonstration
swept beyond the wall of khaki clad
marines.
Elaborating the purposes for which
the 'associated peoples of the world '
are fighting, the president reiterated
that peace can be made only when the
central powers agree to the destruc
tion of militarism, the consent of the
governed for all readjustments, the
sacredness of treaties and the organ
ization of a league of peace. He furth
er forestalled any offers of peace by
compromise which the central powers
may make by announcing that the pur
poses for which the United States In
sending millions of its men to the
trenches may not be fulfilled around
a council table.
"These great ends cannot be achiev
ed by debating," the president assert
ed. Throughout his address, the presi
dent referred to "the peoples" who
are fighting against autocracy, stress
ing thereby the unity of purpose which
actuates the allied nations. On the
other hand, he differentiated between
the people of Germany and their rul
ers as he always has done, speakin
of the isolated, friendless group of
governments whose people are fuel in
their hands.
A single reference to Russia gave
notice to the world that the Unite!
States still account the peoples of the
youngest democracy as allies.' Presi
dent. Wilson enumerated the oppon
ents of Germany as peoples of many
races.
"The people of stricken Russia still
among the rest, though they are for
the moment nnoreanized and helpless.
Especial interest attached to his
words, particularly to hte statement
that Russia's distress Is only temDO
rarv. because of plans now being for
mulated for giving assistance to the
country. Boris Bnkhmeteff. who was
sent here as Russian ambassador dur
ing the Kerensky regime, was in the
audience.

M. Schwab, director general of the

a big vessel for every Jetter in the

the launching of five more from other
yards, and then said that he longed for
many such days. Eight of the twelve
vessels constructed in Mr. Schwab's
plants were destroyers. Four were
freight vessels, one of these being the
Doliance, which set the world's rec

larached in thirty-seven days.
"This is the answer of the Ameri

During the launchings Mr. Schwab
took tim to call for cheers for Presi

SAN FRANCISCO. July 4. America

great forward strides in the building
of ships.

Mr. Schwab, speaking at the Inde

ships here, "that speed records were
first made in the ship yards.
"And If you will stp.nd up to your
job," he asserted, "we'll make the
kaiser take his medicine lying down."
Mr. Schwab's message to ship
builders was fhe first he has delivered
since taking charge of the ship build
ing proeram. The launching was a
part of the national program in which
probably a hundred ships and possi
bly more, were being sent from tha
ways to the seas from yards all over
the country.
"I venture to predict that the num
ber of ships launched today is the
greatest record of launchings for a

Mr. Schwab said.

AMSTERDAM, July 4 During the

Attacking tue government lor uol
representing its views as a whole,
iierr Scheiamann said:
"We want a government whi;h
knows, like the army leaders, how to
beat its aaversaries. lo tne present
government we are unable to vote
even a budget."
George Ledebour, a social democrat
ic leader, was called to order by tne
president of the chamber for declar
ing: "it is the duty of German prole
tariat everywhere to issue a summons
lor a revolution."
Friederich Von Payer, the imperial
vice-chancelor, replied to Herr Scnid-
einann:
"It is well," he said, "that the soc-l
ialist rejection of the budget Is mere
ly a demonstration, for it the otner
parlies acted likewise the cause of the
latherland and freedom would not be
served."
, Herr Scheideiuann's reference to
peace, he added, did not call for a
iresh governmental declaration
"What would result after our pre
vious experiences'" he asked. '"The
usual result is to excite the people
and cause a conflict or view in this
country and abroad. One sees indeed,
something that looks like a tiny spark
and that evokes hope of better in
sight on the port of our enemies, but
' it is in general so weak that the dis
advantages abroad arising from such
dclarations cannot be outweighted by
it.
"These advantages are that enemy
pceroments give a flase meaning to
our sincerely meant words, suggesting
they mean we are unable to bring the
war to a victorious end."
He assented to Herr Scheidemann's
declaration of the German peace terms
-the conclusion of peace with honor
and without prejudicing Germany in
the terms" saying the German gov
ernment had done beyond this formula.
"We must wait until the . enemy'3

the army command and said
"In a war of such duration and ia

WASHINGTON, July 4. President
Wilson today answered all feelers for
a compromise peace, with a new and
unqualified consecration of America to
the struggle for cleaning military auto
cracy from the earth.
At an Independence day gathering
on the steps of the Mount Vernon
home and tomb of George Washington,
and surrounded by scenes which look
ed upon the creation of this nation, the
president addressed a small gathering
of officials and of diplomats of the al
lied nations.
But he spoke to the world and he
spoke the logical sequel to his force
without stint or limit" declaration of
several weeks ago.
Universally, the president de
clared that there could be no
thought of a peace which did not
mean the destruction of military
autocracy or its reduction to vir
tual impotence.
"A reign of law, based on the
consent of the governed and sus
tained by the organied opinion of
mankind," was the way he sum
marized in a single sentence the.
objects of humanity in the world

of Russia "for the moment unorgan

of the world standing against the
enemies of liberty.
The past and the present are in
deadly grapple and the peoples of the
world are being done to death between
them," said President Wilson.
"There can' be but one issue. Tiife

would be tolerable. No half-way de

ends for which the associated peoples

"3. The consent of all nations
to be governed in their conduct
towards each other by the same
principles of honor and respect

their relations with one another;

the organized opinion of mankind.
These great ends cannot be achieved
by debating and seeking to reconcile
and accommodate what statesmen
may wish, with their projects for bal

the determination of what the think
ing people of the world desire, with
their longing hope for justice and for
special freedom aud opportunity."
During the trip to and from Mount
Vernon on the Alayfiower, President
Wilson had many talks with the rep
resentative people who have left their
native lands to find homes in America.
He asked many questions of the group
of Czecho-Slovaks, Chinese, Hungar
ians, even German, for the natives of
countries whose governments are
America's enemies, were among the
visitors.
The informality of the trip down
was abondoned at the landing. The
president landed between lanes of
Marines.
Alter the president and his party
had taken their stand before the
tomb, he ordered that the marines be
drawn in closer, so that the persons
without tickets of admission might
better hear the exercises. When the
marines moved up. the effect was like
the sudden undamming of a great wall
fit water, the spectators being thrust
down the rolling slopes by the pres
sure behind.
For a moment it looked as if a
tragedy would be caused by the tramp
ling of the weaker, but the marines
closed with rifles held across their
breasts and the flood was checked.

rade.-i were falling In great numbers
before the fire of the tanks and the
play or the Australian rifles and bay
onets. One German battalion commander
and nearly all his command were
rounded up and sent on their way to
the rear. Three German divisions were
opposite the Australians the thir
teenth which had Just been brought
to the sector from the north, the forty-third
and the seventy-seventh. Not
withstanding their strength, however,
they were unable to make any show
ing. At only one point did the enemy
hold the attacking troops up and then
only for a brief time.
Just north of this, between the An
cre and the Somme, a minor operation
was in progress. Here the Britisii
made one small attack and two raid-i
which kept the whole line boiling. The
British advanced their line 400 yard
along a front of 1200, in addition to
capturing a considerable number of
prisoners.
The German artillery was shelling
Hamcl this afternoon, but at latest re
ports no counter attack had developed
and the Australians were consolidat
ing their new positions.
TWO ALLIED SUCCESSES
(By the Associated Press.)
By a surprise attack on the German
lines, planned especially as a celebra
tion of American Independence day,
Australian troops took the village 01
Hamel, east of Aimes, occupied Valro
and Hamel woods, south of the village
and captured more than 1500 prison
ers. Tne Australians advanced under
the cover of a smoke barrage and were
led by tanks in the breaking of the
enemy's line over a front of more than
four miles. The attack penetrated a
mile and a half into the German posi
tions. The British war office has an
nounced American participation. This
is the first time they have appeared in
this oart or the line.
The French struck savagely, cutting
the enemy ranks near Aurrecnes.soutn
of Moulin-Sous-Toutvent. where on
Tuesday night they won a local sue
cess and captured prisoners. Here
the Germans lost lObti prisoners.
In both operations tne allies have
improved their positions by gaiulns
rather high ground which can be rcaa
llv del'enued.
At the same time that the British,
French and Americans were attack j
ing the Italians continued to advance
in the area near the mouth of the
Piave. Scattered machine gun em
placements have been cleaned ou'.,
while light boats from the Italian navy
have entered the lagoons on the lett
flank of the Austrian armies and giv
en valuable assistance to the land
forces. The Italians also have won
ground in the San Lorenzo valley,
east of the Brenta river.
Announcement is made that Moham
med V, sultan of Turkey, died Wed
nesday night. The heir to the throne
is usseff Izzeduno, cousin or the de
ceased sultan .and a son of the late
Sultan Abdul Aziz.
Fighting between the German sovi-jl
forces and the peasantry is reported
from Yekaterinburg, the city in east
ern Russia whore the main line of the
trans-Siberian railroad is joined by the
branches of the road running to north
and south Russia. It was reported
lecently that the Czecho-Slovak troops
were in control of Yekaterinburg and
it is said that an army of 200,000 peas
ants, well armed, has been formed
there.
German attempts to drive American
forces from their positions at Vaux,
west of Chateau Thierry seem to have
tailed utterly. There have been no
further reports of desperate German
etforts to regain the line irom which
they were unceremoniously ousted by
the Americans Tuesday night.
In all the allied countries and their
colonies the American Independenca
day was observed in an unprecedeut
eu manner. In London and the large
cities of England there were special
exercises. Lven the small towns join
ed in honoring the United States; in
France, the people of Paris and a
great many other cities entered into
the observance of the day with their
proverbial enthusiasm and elaborato
programs were carried out. In Italy
the smaller citie3 vied with their larg
er cities in the celebration of the day.
South American nations, three of
which had declared the day a national
holiday, participated in what was vir
tually a world wide demonstration in
commemoration of American inde
pendence. Along the American sectors of the
battle line in France the day was ob
served by the boys in khaki, who wore
called upon to perform only work that
was absolutely necessary. The Ger

time to ninety days and then to fifty
five days. It is men like David Ris
ers, at the Skinner and Kddy plant,
and Joe Tynan at the l'n-m Iron
works, men who know their joos and
treat their men sijuarely. they are tiie
kind of men on whom the government
relies for the right leadership in this
snip building government."
Mr. Schwab dec'ared the I' boats
ore already on t!:e run. "And if we
keep up the pace we will have them
bca'en by net year."
"I have cone to the western coast
to congratulate, on behalf of the gov
ernment, the loyal battalions of ship
builders in this pnrt of the country,
who are laboring for America's suc
cess in war against Germany,"
Schwab said.',
"Some of the finest records of sh I;
building achievement since v-e entore-l
this war have been scored on th3 Pa
cific coast. You are far away from
Washington, but yen need never tear
that this splendid service you are per
forming is overlooked at any tim-.. by
the commander in chief cf the rrny
and navy, our beloved leader, Presi
dent Wilson.
"You and every man in every ship
yard in America are making saerifi-es.
You are performing a very necessary
and very patriotic servic e. It will go
further, perhaps, toward winning the
war than any other service short of
the righting cn the batt'e fields of
France.
"Ono hundred and forty-two years
a;;o, America declared her independ
ence. Today we are celebrating that
independence. The liberty bell tolled
our determination to have our free
dom then, and today scores of theso
ships pre sliding into American wat
ers, signifying American determina
tion to preserve thii freedom from
German autocracy.
"We stand firm, demand and un
frald before the naked truth that wo
must defeat Germany or Germany will
defeat v"?. We have to go over the
top in the shipyards just as the United
States marines went over to top at
Chateau Thierry in France.
"Wars are not won altoeether on
the battle field. News of America's
accomplishments in the ship .mls
causes a'most as much concern in Ger
many as actual defeat. Do not think
for one minute that the Prussian gen
erals are unmoved by what we are
accomplishing. They know that we
launched a 5500 ton ship in twenty
seven days from the time the keel
was laid over in Camden, N. J. Tnat
was a tremendous accomplishment
never before approached in any coun
try and it was a blow in the face of
Prussian confidence. Our enemy kuow-j
too, that it is the workmen over hero
that are making these things possible.
The kaiser knows that with the united
backing of American workmen, Ameri
can p.rmies can never be beaten. .The
credit for winning this war will be
shared equally by the workmen of
America and the fighters of Ameilc-i.
"The tast captains and colonels in
our ship building army cannot build
ships without the strong armies of
privates, corporals and sergeants. Th!
heater boy today is a young hero who
deserves a place alongside the drum
mer boy in that picture you have seen
so often "The Spirit of '76."
"I had a telegram recently, telling
me how Burt Myers, a riveter, and
i:is gang in the Ixmg Reach ship
building company's yard drove 2137.
seven-eighths inch flush rivets in a
shell in eight hours Th-.'.t kind of a
day's work, made by steady workmen
and translated into high averages, put
ships into the water in record break
ing time.
"We have a great army of workers
building ships for this emergency.
There are 300.000 of us, and we are
all fighting for America. You men
who swing the cranes are in chargo
of the big guns. You who drive the
rivets are operating the machine guns
of the ship yard.
"German submarines appeared re
cently off the Atlantic coast trying
to crowd ta off the ocean highway.
That was no new thing for German;-.
Prussian officers in German cities
crowd civilians off . the pavements
when they stride through the streets.
Americans know their rights and will
not be crowded off the streets or off
the ocean highways. Germany's pur
pose in sending submarines to Amer
ican waters was to cow this great na
tion into inaction and to paralyze our
preparations. Germany has failed in
her purpose. The .loss of a few ships
tiay sting but it only goads us on to
tarder fighting.
"Every time we launch a ship we
add to the certainty that German sub
marines cannot win this war.
"If we keep up the pace we will
have them beaten by next year. And
when we achieve this victory it will
be you who will deserve the credit.
"Now what did this German raid on
American shipping amount to? These
scavengers of the sea began their ac
tivities on May 25, and we continued
to hear from them up to June 16. In
that time they had sunk ten Ameri
can vessels. 2G.0U0 dead weight tons.
They' were mostly small ships, unarm
ed and of no great consequence in the
winning of th.3 war. In the same pe.
riod of time, from May 25 to June 13.
American shipyards completed and
delivered to the I'nited States shii
ping board thirtv vessels, ransing in
tonnoge from 3500 to 10.000 dexl
weight, and aggregating 167.000 dea.l
weight tons. Placing thirty ships of
1G7,I00 tons against ten ships of L'tJ.O'in
tons and you can see how much thH
terrible submarine raid on Ameriiu
amounted to. .

Compiegne
Situated on the southeast bank of the
River Oise, just a mile below its confluence
with the Aisne, the city of Compiegne, with
a population of 1 7,000 at the outbreak of
the war, is fifty-two miles by rail northeast
of Paris on the Paris-St. Quentin railway,
forty-five miles southeast of Amiens, and
twenty-five miles west of Soissons.
The National Geographical Bulletin has -compiled
some interesting facts about this
famous place i
It is one of the most interesting cities in
this part of France, having been known as
Compendium in the days of Clovis. Its
beautiful location,, on the northwestern
fringe of the superb forest of Compiegne,
made it a favorite country residence of
many French monarchs. The forest, which
contains more than 35,000 acres and is fifty-eight
miles in circumference, was for
centuries a great royal hunting preserve.
It was Louis XV who commissioned
Gabriel to build the! magnificent palace,
which is still well preserved, and it was that
monarch who here welcomed Marie An
toinette, the ill-fated daughter of Marie
Theresa, to France, when at 1 5 she became
the bride of, the dauphin, the future Loui3
XVI. It was here also that that other Aus
trian princess, Marie Louise, spent her brief
but happy honeymoon with Napoleon I.
As an evidence of the emperor's infatuation
for his bride (an infatuation which caused
Metternich to write that "he is so evidently
in love with her that he cannot conceal his
feelings, and all his customary ways of life
are subordinate to her wishes) there is still
to be seen in the park surrounding the pal
ace an iron trellis which he ordered built to
remind the 19-year-old empress of her
favorite trellis at Schronbrunn This inci
dent is reminiscent of the devotion dis
played by . the Babylonian king who built
one of the seven wonders of the world the
hanging gardens in order that his bride
might not be without her native mountain
scenery even on the plains of the Euphrates.
It was at Compiegne that one of the sad
dest episodes in French history occurred
the capture of Joan of Arc by the Burgun
dians in 1 430, followed by her martyrdom
at the stake just twelve months later in
Rouen.
Before the war Compiegne was an indus
trial town of considerable importance, its
chief activities being boat building, rope
making, distilling and the manufactuie of
chocolate, machinery, sacks, chemicals and
hats. It also carried on a thriving river
borne traffic in timber and coal, and its
asparagus farms were famous.
In 1814 Compiegne offered a stern re
sistance to the Prussians; in the Franco
Prussian conflict of 1870-1871 it was one
of the headquarters of the German army.
Now it is in the line of the Germans' at
tempted advance on the Noyon-Montdidier
front.
Now and for all time to come Compiegne
will be dear to the hearts of the French
people not because it was once a favorite
residence of Louis XV, Louis XVI, Na
poleon I, Louis Philippe, and Napoleon III,
but because Christmas eve, 1 894, there was
born Georges Guynemer, "Ace of Aces,
the foremost airman of France, who, before
his tragic death at 23 years old, had won
every honor that his grateful country could
bestow upon the matchless defender.
and the job not half done yet. "Waiting for
material" is the oldest song ever sung by
mortal men engaged upon a public work,
and the public must listen to this song with
all its discords and discomforts and wait
and wonder and pay.
Naco read from the depot to Slag Dump
hill h-is bpen torn up now for about a
month, half paved and half not. It is the
main traveled street of the district and it is
a rharne that it should lc left in this condi
tion so long. The paving company in charge
of this work very promplly tore up the
street and turned their men loose upon ii
with plough and shovel and scraper. Some
paving was put down and then the work
stopecd, presumably because of failure of
materwl to arrive. But why tear up a street
until the material is on the ground? It h
a strange way for a big company to do
business. Two months sport upon a lit tit;
job of paving a few hundred feet of street
' ALAS FOR SPAIN
Capt. F. H. La Guardia of New York
City, representative in the American con
gress, who is making a tour of Spain, has
told the Spanish people that they and their
government are injuring themselves by
friendliness toward Germany. He pointed
out in an interview given to the Barcelona
La Publicidad that while Spain was taking
this attitude her vessels carrying raw mate
rials vitally necessary to Spanish industries
were being sunk ruthlessly by German sub
marines. Publication of the interview ha3 caused
a stir throughout Spain. Representative
La Guardia has completed a trip through
Spain to study the effect of the many-sided
German propaganda floated there. He finds
that about. 50 per cent of the "thinking
classes" in Spain are avowedly for the en
tente against Germany, but that the great
mass of the working classes, and the Span
ish government thus far, have been swayed
by the German press campaign, especially
by the anti-American feature of it, to dis
regard Spain's real interests. The govern
ment, he believes, would turn to a pro-entente
attitude, at least, if American stand
points and ideals were better known.
This, however, he thinks, is impossible
as long as the Germanophile portion of the
press continued to keep alive bitterness re
sulting from the Spanish-American war
and the loss of Cuba and the Philippines,
while it belittles or ignores the sinking of
Spanish ships with the consequent loss of
materials intended to keep Spanish industry
alive.
In the old days the Egyptian taskmasters
forced the Israelites to make bricks without
straw. Now the Bolsheviki, in giving Rus
sia a modern Utopia where the poor man
and the peasant shall reign supreme under
the hand of the German kaiser, has forced
the people to eat bread made of straw. Must
be awful nice bread ! And they do say that
even this bread is very costly and hard to
procure.
FERSHING TELLS
HISTORY OF AN
EXCITING COMBAT
(Continued from Page One)
of patricular note was observed ex
cept that a party of forty to fifty Ger
niaus came under our rifle fire while
moving in the vicinity of Fontaine
Wood. They were scattered and put
to flight. During the morning a prop
aganda balloon came down Inside our
lines.'
It is said that Hunt now threatens to de
prive Cochise county of representation
upon the state council of defense, since his
first appointee for this place declined ac
ceptance and the second was rejected by
the county board of supervisors. Very
well. The county would prefer no repre
sentation at all to the Hunt brand. Hunt,
and not Cochise county, will suffer in pub
lic opinion by such a state of affairs. Hunt's
animosity towards Cochise is well known,
hence the very necessity that he outwardly
at least; pretend to fairness and imparitality
towards a community which he has abused
with such virulence and consistency during
all of his last term of office. Cochise is one
of the most important counties cf the
young state and her absence from the coun
cil of defense will be noted, especially m
view of her enlistment record, her bond
and Red Cross drives and her war work
generally.
Up in Walla Walla, Washington, they
know how to deal with the I. W. W. in
their little tantrums. A group of some
fifteen wobblies were confined in the Walla
Walla jail on federal charges and were ex
pressing their dissatisfaction with the gov
ernment and society in general by making
the day and the night hideous with yells,
jeers and curses and beating on their prison
bars. A diet of bread and water did not
affect them except to increase their din.
Finally the sheriff doused them with the
jail hose. Now an I. W. W. hates water, but
this bunch of outlaws were particularly ob
durate, and they braved even the water and
kept up their- infernal noise. Then the
sheriff took a long, long think and became
possessed of a brilliant idea. He sent for
the fire department. The firemen hooked
their hose to a hydrant and turned a stream
upon the pack that had about ninety pounds
of pressure behind it. 1 alk about knock
ing down ten pins! That was nothing to
what that fire hose did to those wobblies
All but the leader gave in after five minutes
of the treatment and promised to le good.
The leader was stubborn and stood for fif
teen minutes of the pressure before he, loo.
gave up. Of course, rs is the I. W. Yv .
way. they resumed their noise as soon as
the fire department had gone and had to
be quieted with a threat of its return. But
that Walla Walla sheriff is in Mary Wheel
er's rlass in the matter of resource in deal
ing with the wobbly in his native haunts.
PERSHING CONTINUES ACCOUNT
WASHINGTON. July 4. In a con
tinuation of Tuesday's communique.
General Pershing today reported in
graphic detail on the successful Amer
ican operations near Chateau Thierry
Monday and described activities along
the various fronts held by Americans
during several preceding days. The
dispatch follows:
"Section B: The successful attacks
made by our troops in the Chateau
Thierry region on the evening of July
1 was carried out by two battalions of
United States infantry. The attack
was preceded by a finely executed ar
tillery preparation which was executed
by American batteries and lasted
twelve hours. The infantry action
commenced at 6 o'clock in the evening.
All objectives were gained and our io
sitiens consolidated inside of one and
a half hours. The enemy's losses were
exceedingly heavy, one of his regi
ments being practically annihilated.
"The enemy's positions were taken
at the point of the bayonet, ine
amount of material captured was very
large and included considerable quan
tities of ammunition.
"At 3:45 o'clock in the morning the
Germans counter attacked. Thanks to
the thorough consolidation of Xhe po
sition which had been made, the coun
ter attack was repulsed with heavy
losses to the enemy in killed and
wounded. It also resulted in the tak
ing by us of additional prisoners. The
number of prisoners so far counted is
over 500. and includes six officers. Our
casualties were light, considering the
success obtained.
"In the Chateau Thierry region be
tween noon June 29 aud 30 there was
considerable activity of various sorts
although no important developments
took place. The German artulery was
aeain aggressive, delivering much
harassing fire during the morning
hours. Thi3 was directed in part on
our advance positions along the Bel
leau, Clerembauts and Marette Woods,
and was especially heavy on the right
of our positions. Numerous points in
our rear areas were also shelled. The
lire was continuous rather than heavy,
ilich explosive, shrapnel and a small
amount of gas were all employed. Be
sides delivering harassing lire the Ger
man batteries were obviously attempt-
in? to register on some of the roads
in our rear.
"Our own batteries vigorously re
turned the fire and at one point reg
istered directly upon a detachment of
the enemy. The activity of the Ger
man airplanes, like that of the 3er-
mans artillery, was notable in being
continuous rather than concentrated
at any one time or place. Mora than
the usual number of balloons were in
evidence. One of the, hostile planes
was brought down by :inti-aircral't Hre
opposite the right of our sector and
forced to land behind its own lines.
Numerous groups of men passed fre
quently along the roads running be
tween Givey, Empaux, Belleau, Bon
nes, Griesoiles, Etrepilly, I.e Tartro
and Plaisance. Wagons and trucks
moved along the same routes t-mgly
and in large groups. Inf iiitry activ
ity on both sides wns narmol.
"Along the Mama on ihe 28th and
211th of June the German artillery con
tinued to deliver the scattered but
fairly vigorous fire of tne days preced
ing. On this day, however, the heav
iest fire was on the left i ether than
on the right of our sector. On tho
other hand, our left sector still con
tinued to draw most of the shrapnel.
The shelling was confined mostly to !
the afternoon and evening, and on ob-j
jectives identical with th'.-s previous-!
ly reported. German machine gum
wero particularly quiet and there was
little ritle tire; Hostile airplanes were
also less frequently observed than has
been usual during the past fortnight.
Behind the German lines men were
seen strolling about iu the usual fash
ion. "In the Colmar sector the day oi
Juno 2! passed quietly. The German
intautry delivered some scattering ma
chine gun and rifle lire and made use
of a lew hand and rifle grenades.
Huring the night German patrols were
observed on several occasions, two of
them coaling under our ritle and gren
ade tire. There were no encounter
and no serious attempts to reach our
lines. The German artillery delivered
only light and scattered fire with guns
mainly of medium caliber. His air
planes appeared only at rare interval
and were in nearly every case driven
back by our anti-aircraft batteries.
They were engaged mainly in recon
naissance work, but made some at
tempts to regulate the artillery fire.
Behind the German lines the haymak
ing, in which women play an increas
ingly large part, continued, but neither
in the matter of circulation nor in the
construction of works did anything
of note occur.
"In the Mulhouse sector thero
no unusual occurrence on June 'S
apart trom the increased activity on
tho part of the German air forces. Late
in the altemoon an air combat occur

was scon to descend in an apparent
ly crippled condition. Light artillery
lire. the. throwing of a few grenades
( ii our wire, with norm.il rifle fire and
the ordinary circulation in the Gor
man rear areas comprised the other
activities of the day."
can hospitals also were decorated and
occasional ambulances, bearing a few
wounded, were cheered along the
roadways, girls throwing kisses and
wild flowers.
Athletic contests between many of
the American regiments deve!oicd the
keenest eomptition. Officers con
tributed the prizes and there were
races, boxing and baseball.
The Germans also knew it was
America's great day from the artillery,
machine gun and rufle firing whicn
was increased on the American fronts.
It gave the enemy something to thiiiK
about and made him keep his head
down in the trenches and dugouts.

ENTHUSIASM AT LUNCHEON
PARIS. July 4 There was a historic
scene at the luncheon of the American
chamber of commerce today w hen th-?
Earl and Derby, the British ambas
sador and William O. Sharp, American
ambassador clasped hands in celebra
tion of America's Independence day. It
was the first time since the United
States became a nation that a British
ambassador had attended a commem
oration of the event.
Even if we had not been allies.
said Lord Derby, in commenting on hi
appreciation, "I should have come."
Judge Walter Berry, wno presided
at the luncheon, reiterated America's
determination to carry on the war to
a successful termination, clainitng
neither annexation nor indemnity.
His reference to the launching of
500,000 tons of shipping in America
today was received with uproarous
cheering. "W e celebrate, but we don t
loaf." he said.
When he mentioned the name oi
Marshal Joffre, the enthusiasm was
such that the marshal had to arise and
bow repeatedly.
After Judge Berry had read a let
ter from General Pershing, expressing
regret that his urgent military dutie3
did not permit him to be present. Gen
eral Tasker H. Bliss brought a mes
sage from the American army.
Ambassador Sharp thanked France
briefly for the great manifestatian in
honor of Independence day and continued:
'Lord Derby, representing England.
has broken an unwritten rule which
has lasted from time immemorial with
respect to an English ambassador at
tending the celebration of our inde
pendence. I congratulate him. I con
gratulate the great country which he
represents. It is in keeping with the
British spirit of fairness. Wo know
now why England is so great. I wel
come Lord Derby here in ths namo of
America."
The audience arose, cheering Lord
Derby and shouting for a speech. Lord
Derby demurred at first but the cheers
would not down. Finally he said:
"I had always thought that America
meant fair play, but it Is hardly fair
to call on me on such short notice
to reply to such an eloquent tribute
as has been paid me by Ambassador
Sharp. As in the days of my youth
a teacher spanked me. saying 'you will
thank me later for this' I say now I
wish to thank America for the best
licking we ever got.
"It has done us both a lot oi good.
We are grateful to you because that
licking taught us how to treat our chil
dren: it is the reason why we now
have Australia and Canada and even
South Africa fighting beside us to
day."

NEW YORK. July 4. Hie ideals of
freedom and justice, enforced by the
willingness to sacrifice of twenty-one
nations, are stronger than ail the bat
teries of Krupp, all the aircraft of

undersea assassins of Von Tirpitz,
Secretary Daniels said here tonight in
an independence Day address.
"On this anniversary," said Mr.
Daniels, "while owing most for inde
pendence to the commanding figure of
George Washington, we turn to J offer,
son. second only to the illustrious suc
cessful military chieftain of the revo
lution for the inspiration that nerved
men then as now to place love of free
government above love of life."
"W!e shall pay a heavy toll before
victory comes," continued Mr. Daniels,
"but all is not staked on a single bat
tle and neither reverses on lanrl nor
sinking' of merchant vessels (a
species of piracy on a par with that
which Jeqerson stamped out when ho
was president will avail, because the
Americans and their brave associates
with 'immortal hate' of 'despicable
deeds' have the 'unconquerable
and 'courage never to submit or yield.'
"It may take weeks, it may take I
months, it may take years. But Amer
ica has never taken up arms except
for liberyt, and has never sheathed
sword except in victory, ar.d the boys
will come back home ami most of
them will come back conquerors In

pendence to all na'ions that the Fourth
of Julv, 1773, insured for America."

MRS. ED. SHEEREN
GAINS 23 FOUNDS
Seattle Woman's Suffering of
Twelve Years Standing Is
Now Ended
"I have had a long hard struggle
with ill health, but by the help of
Tanlac 1 have at last overcome my
troubles, and have actually gained
twenty-three pounds in weight be
sides," was the interesting and re
markable statement made by Mrs. Ed.
Sheeren, of Sll Fifth Street West,
Seattle, Wash., recently.
"Nearly twelve years ago," she con
tinued, "I had a very severe spell of
typhoid fever, which left my nerves
all shattered, and my stomach in an
awful condition. My food would not
digest, but would Just lay in my stom
ach and sour and ferment and make
trouble for me. 1 would often get up
in the mornings nauseated and was
constantly belching up particles of un
digested food. My nerves were so torn
up that I could hardly sleep, and I
suffered with headache night and day.
1 had a continual pain across my brick
and all down one side of my body, and
was down in bed all last summer, un
able to turn my hands to a thing. 1
suffered until 1 was almost distract
ed.
"I got down to where I weighed only
one hundred and thirty-four pounds
and kept getting thinner and weaker
all the time. 1 made up my mind froia
what I read in the papers about Tan
lac to try it( and it has done me more
good than I ever expected. My appe
tite is splendid now, and I can eat just
anything 1 want without feeling a sign
or indigestion or sour stomach. My
nerves are strong and steady, I sleep
like a child every night, and get up in
the mornings feeling fine. I have not
felt the pain in my back and .side
since shortly after I began takinR Tan
lac, and it has built me up until now
I weigh one hundred and sixty-seven
pounds making an actual gain of twenty-three
pounds. I, of course think,
Tanlac is the grandest medicine in the
world. 1 have the best of reasons for
praising it, and hope others will take
it and find relief."
Here is another instance of the won
derful reconstructive powers of Tan
lac, and Mrs. Sheeren is only one of
many thousands who have taken it
with the same gratifying results, i'an
lac proved of great benefit to her
simply because it contains certain me
dicinal properties which enrich the
biood and promotes a healthy appetite
for nourishing food, thus helping to
build up health and strength in the
natural way. Tanlac has been very
successful in overcoming nervousness
and sleeplessness, not from a quiet
ing effect on the nerves but by
strengthening the nerves and body
and bringing back the normal state of
health through its effect on the appe
tite and nutrition of the body.
Tanlac is sold In Bisbee by J. M.
Ball, in Douglas by Douglas Drug Co.,
in Paradise by G. A. Walker, in Bowie
by Bowie Drug Store, in Sau Simon by
J. B. Cooke, in Willcox by A. A. Nichol
son, in Lowell by Lowell Drug Co., in
Benson by C. F. Moss Pharmacy, and

That goes to the very bottom of

Arizona counties are political sub
divisions of magnificent distances.
Some of them, in fact, most of them,
are larger in area than some eastern
states. In many of thecounties there
is little communication between one
part and another. A man who has

The adoption of the primary system
makes such a change in the manner j
of selecting members of the legisla-1
ture desirable. The success of the pri-1
mary system depends entirely upon I
the intelligence of the -voters, upon j
their facilities for information con j
cerning candidates. Without such fa-!
cilities. the primary system is the !
worst that can be devised.
It is a matter of fact that the mem
bership of our state legislatures, in
point of ability, has been far below
that of the old territorial legislatures.
In the old days we had men of power '
and leadership, qualities that have !
j teen sadly lacking since. The old- i
time legislators were not at all good j
men. Some of them were politicians, i
and it is said that some of them were '
corrupt. But they were all men orj

well known throughout their counties

SHOULD TAKE WARNING.
There are a number of auto own
ers in the district who are now using
dealers' license numbers and have
been for the past ten days. They have
not been bothered by the representa
tives of the sheriff's office for the rea
son that it was close to the first of
July and they were allowed to make
their applications after the first so
as to get the reduction in the licenses.
Commencing next Monday they will be
arrested if they do not produce re
ceipts showing that the licenses have
been applied for. Dealers who have
been allowing the purchasers to run
with their license plates over the re
quired time are liable to arrest also.
