President Wilson tonight for

is divided into 29 districts and every
producer in a district will market his
output at the same price.

attacks by the Germans met with re

"Early fighting has taken place and
still continues.
"At mid-day two strong counter at
tacks northwest of Lena were beaten
off by our troops and a third counter
attack south of the town was broken j
up by our artillery."
Battle Still Raging.
BRITISH FRONT IN FRANCE AND
BELGIUM, August 21. The fierce bat
tle which began at dawn today on the
outskirts of the city of Lens continu
ed throughout the day at close quar
ters and late this afternoon there was
no diminution in the intensity of the
struggle between the attacking Cana
dians and the Germans.
The Canadians this morning fought
their way forwaoi. with bombs and
bayonets and occupied important
enemy defenses northwest and south
west of the heart of the city and since
then the Germans have been sending
in wave after wave of troops In des
perate counter-attacks.
Heavy Casualties.
The Canadians have held strongly
and the Germans have suffered very
heavy casualties as they must have
expected, from the nature of their
courfTer thrusts, in which no thought
is given to the cost in life.
The striking feature of the battle
lies in the fact that the Germans had
also masse dtroops for a counter at
tack at dawn against the newly-acquired
Canadian positions in the north
west environs of Lens and had actu
ally started their advance when they
were surprised by encountering the
on-rushing Canadians In No Man'b
Land. Both offensives had begun at
the same hour, but a heavy mist hung
over the ground and the Germans were
apparently unaware of the Canadians'
plans for offensive operations at such
a time.
Fighting Is Bitter.
Brief but bitter fighting occurred in
No Man's Land. The German offen
sive failed to rally their men against
the Canadians and the enemy infan
try gradually fell back to the trenches
which they had just left. The Cana
dians followed and, leaping on the par
apets, hurled masses of bombs down
among Germans who had been held
for the attack. The Germans tried to
flee through the communication
trenches but the Canadians jumped

Verdun Is Kept Up With

(By Review Leased Wire.)
HARD smashes at the German lines
in France again have been pro
ductive of Important gains for
the entente allies. North of Ver
dun the French have captured addition
al point of vantage, which the Cana
dians have fought their way forward
nearer to the heart of the town of
Lenz, taking 2000 yards of positions
west and northwest of the town.
All the counter attacks by the Ger
man crown prince's forces against
General Petain'a men on the newly
captured ground in the Verdun see
tor have been ill starred; those of
Crown Prince Rupprecht against the
doughty Canadians at last accounts
had brought nothing more than an
augmentation of the already numerous
disappointments. The Germans have
suffered in their attempts to save the
important coal center from capture.
Unexpected Meeting
Under a canopy of mist the Cana
dians and Germans met at daylight in
the Open of No Man's Land northwest
of Lens, neither expecting the other.
Springing at their foe with their usual
intrepidity the Canadians put the Ger
mans to the bayonet and forced them
to scurry, seeking a haven of safety
inside their trenches. Here, however,
the Germans apparently were no more
secure than In the open, for again with
the bayonet and with bombs the Cana
dians did great execution, killing or
wounding many of the occupants and
putting the others to flight.
West of Lens, aided by a heavy ar
tillery fire, the Canadians also advanc
ed, pushing the Germans further Into
the environs of the town. To both the
captured positions the Canadians are
holding tenaciously, already having
put down with heavy losses three
strong counter attacks two on the
northwest and one west of the town.
Offensive Continues
North of Verdun, on both sides of
the river Meuse, the French troops
have kept up their vigorous offensive
started Monday and have been re
warded by the capture of additional
Important positions. West of the river.
Cote 1'Ole, a point of considerable stra
tegic value, and the village of Regne
ville, have been taken, while east of
the stream the village of Samogneux
and fortified trenches Over a front of
about a mile and a half, connecting
Samogneux with the defensive on Hill
344, are in the hands of General Pe
tain's men.
Counter attacks by the Germans all
along the new front have been repul
sed by the French.
In addition to more than 5000 pris
oners taken by the French in Mon
day's advance, additional captures re
sulted from the attacks of Tuesday.
The German war Office, possibly with
the idea of heartening the people at
home, says counter attacks by the Fer-
mans have driven out the French from
almost all the positions they captured

HAVANA. Aug. 21. At the presi

Cuba, President MenOcal signed a

of war by the Cuban government
on the day this country declared

RIFLES IJJE WORLD
Famous Enfields, Re-chambered

Will Prove Far Superior to

(By Review Leased Wire).
WASHINGTON. Aug. 21. There is
no shortage of rifles for the American
forces sent to Europe, although there
may be tome delay in equipping all
men of the national army with weap
ons they are to use in training, it was
said officially today at the war depart
ment The forces sent abroad will carry an
average Of at least two rifles per man
as an adequate protection against loss
and wear and tear. It may be neces
sary, only for a short time, at the army
training camps tor one company to use
the available training rifles in the
morning with another company doing
Its training and target practice in the
afternoon with the same weapons.
This situation will be Of short dura
tion, however, as an enormous supply
of Enfield rifles already ordered to
supplant the American Springfield
will be delivered soon after national
army forces are mobilized.
The Enfield rifles have been re-chambered
for American ammunition which,
in the opinion of army Ordnance ex
perts, makes them far better guns than
those used by the British. The Ameri
can Enfields will be harder hitting and
of longer range than the British and
the ammunition more stable under any
weather conditions.

(By Review Leased Wire.)
CANADIAN HEADQUARTERS
IN FRANCE. Aug. 21. Due south
of Lens, almost two miles around
a semicircle front, a series of en
gagements have been fought which, for
hard fighting on both sides, has seldom
been equalled during the struggle for
Lens. The cellars In this region had
been crammed full of machine guns
and trench mortars in anticipation
that the Canadian attack would con
sist entirely Of a frontal assault.
The enemy troops were alo numer
ous and they swarmed up from the cel
lars wehnever the artillery fire was
suspended to permit of our infantry
going forward. They fought and died
without any "kammerading."
All day the enemy has been bring
ing up fresh bodies of troops. A new
guard division has been identified as
the first guards reserve. Three bat
talions of this elite body of troops
were thrown into battle this afternoon
and suffered almost as greatly as the
fourth guards division last week. An
other fresh formation identified is the
Thirty-sixth division. Since the artil
lery duel prior bo the battle reached iu
height four enem oi'miuus', tne sev
enth, eighth, eleventh and twenty-second
have been withdrawn in an ex
hausted condition and of the four en
emy divisions now confronting the Ca
nadian corps one-fourth of the guards
are "all in."
Our casualties mount up, but are
not to be compared to those of the
Germans, whose dead lie thickly all
along the front and at some points are
closely strewn In our newly captured
positions.
Lens has been a' name of tragic
meaning to the enemy, but he clings
on the husk of the city at fearful cost
rather than confess defeat. The sun
went down tonight on the smoking
ruins wherein men who had been bat
tling for 20 hours still fought on, ob
livious of ttie passage of time.
OFFICIAL SUMMARY
OF U. S. ACTIVITIES
TO BE ISSUED SOON
(By Review Leased Wire.)
WASHINGTON. Aug. 21. The first
official summary of the war activities
of the United States will be issued in
a few days.
The exact nature of the statement
has not been made known. Secretary
Baker said he would go kjust as far as
the military advisors of the govern
ment deemed it wise, toward Inform
ing the public of what was in progress.
Information of every sort reaching the
' department will be scrutinized for pub-
lishabte matter.
When American troops get into ac
tion in France, daily statements prob
ably will be Issued, founded upon re
ports from General Pershing. Re
garding rumors of disasters to Ameri
can troops and shipping, constantly be
ing carried, Mr. Baker reiterated em
phatically the pledge of the adminis
tration to publish all news that would
not be of strategic value to the enemy.
Such rumors as have been current
recently, he said, were without any
foundation whatever. The extent to
which naval happenings can be made
public Is a different matter. Secretary
Daniels has promised that news of
disasters will be given out with as
little delay as possible, but It is not
to be expected that the extent of naval
damages, temporary disablement ot
destroyers or other vessels, either as a
result of action or through accident
will be disclosed. The practice of all
countries has been to keep the enemy
as much in the dark as possible on
such, matters. THE BISBEE DAILY REVIEW, WEDNESDAY MORNING, AUGUST 22, 1917.

ALL BISBEE STORES
MAY CLOSE AT SIX
ON SATURDAY NIGHTS
Cisbee merchants and clerks have c
movement on foot to close the stores
at 6 o'clock every Saturday night The
Fair, Phelps Dodge, Angius, Schwartz
Brothers and Manager Bovee of the
Woolworth store are all in favor of the
plan, and of course the clerks are
strong for it If all the merchants will
agree to the 6 o'clock closing it will
soon be a fact
City stores all over the country have
had 6 o'clock closing on Saturdays for
years, and in many of the larger cities
the department stores close at 1
o'clock Saturday in the summer
months
.A meeting will be held one night
next week to consider the matter fur
ther. Those favoring the plan argue that
Saturday night is both rest and rec
reation time just as much as Sunday
Is rest time. Trade is always quiet
in the afternoon and then clerks and
employers are kept on duty until 9
o'clock doing a business that could
just as well have been done by 6
o'clock. It is a long day from 8 in
the morning to 9 at night
WOMEN WILL PERFECT
BRANCH OF LOW
LEAGUES OF AMERICA
Every loyal, American woman of the
Warren District is invited to attend
a meeting to be held Thursday after
noon, at 3 o'clock at the gymnasium
of the Y. M. C. A. The object of this
meeting is to form a woman's branch
of the loyalty League of America.
Since the women of the Warren
District have interes'ed themselves in
the movement, which was started some
weeks ago, it has been felt by many of
them that some kind of an organiza
tion should be perfected sd that their
influence sould be felt. It is in fol
lowing out this line of thought that the
meeting of Thursday will be held.
No definite plans have been made
for the meeting of the perfection of
the organization hut indications point
to the formation of an active, co-operative
unit with the Loyalty Leagues
which will grow as did original organization.
MAKE WOBBLIES BUILD
ROAD ACROSS DESERT,
ADVICE OF WALLACE
Local Realty Man, Returning!
From Coast, Conceives New
Method of Deriving Benefit
From Agitators.
I. W. Wallace, the well known Bis
bee real estate man, who returned a
few days from the coast, was Impress
ed, as he looked out Of the car win
dow of his speeding train, with the
need of a military road across the des
ert both east and west of Yuma from
the railroad 'bridge across the Colo
rado river. And, turning the matter
Over in his mind reflectively since his
return, he has come to a conclusion
in the premises that is almost an in
spiration. "The thing to do," declared Mr. Wal
lace yesterday to the Review, "is to
arrest all wobblies in the towns, cities
and camps of Arizona on a vagrancy
charge and put them to" work building
a fine road across the desert. The
state needs the road and the wobblie
needs to be put to work. Cochise coun
ty is using her bootlegger prisoners on
a fine county road with good results.
Why not a great state road, built by
men who are thrice the menace to
the community at large that the boot
leggers ever were?
"And we should have California co
operate with us in this matter and
carry the road on west over the desert
across her borders built by her wob
blies. She has plenty for this work,
and from what I heard on the coast
she considers them as much of a men
ace to her progress and prosperity as
we do here in Arizona."

ARIZONA-OKLAHOMA
OIL LANDS SAID TO
BE BEST IN DISTRICT
Emil Marks and J. W. Hogan,
of Bisbee, Now in Tulsa
Field. Having Ground Ex
perted and Contracted for
Drilling of Well
Emil Marks and J. W. Hogan, direc
tors of the Arizona-Oklahoma Oil com
pany, who are now in the Tulsa field
looking nfter the interests of the com
pany, have wired here that the pros
pects there are more encouraging than
they had been led tb believe. Marks
and Hogan will return to Bisbee very
shortly wita a more elaborate report.
In a wire received in Bisbee yester
day Marks and Hogan called the land
of the Arizona-Oklahoma company the
"very best in the district"
Dr. Fleming, a noted oil geologist
of the Oklahoma regian, and a prac
tical man as well, has been engaged by
the company to report on the prop
erty. His preliminary work, according
to the Bisbeeites, accounts for their
optimism. Fleming nad been engaged
to inspect the property and also to get
up a contract for drilling on the prop
erty for the approval of the two visi
tors. The property of the Arizona-Oklahoma
Oil company is very centrally
located in what is known as the great
est oil belt in the country near Tul
sa. Over a year ago Bisbee men be
came interested in the land and organ
ized the company which purchased
the acreage. Owing to the disinclina
tion of the investing public in Arizona
to become interested in anything' but
coppers the oil promotion was slow.
Now, however, the company appears
to be in good shape and expects to
send d'own its first well In a very short
while.
Meanwhile, stockholders in Bisb.'e
are watching with interest and expec
tation the progress made on the prop
erty.

ARIZONA SOLDIERS
WILL GET PEACHES
E
Peach day for the soldiers of the
First Arizona regiment, stationed at
Naco, will be celebrated this week
The peaches are to be sent from the
Salt River valley, under the direction
of the Phoenix Chamber f Commerce
and the Red Cross.
There is an abundance of peaches in
the valley now. The growers have
plenty of peaches and the Chamber of
Commerce and the Red Cross request
that as many peaches as the growers
wish to contribute be taken to the Wal
ter Hill produce establishment In
Phoenix Tuesday and Wednesday so
that the fruit can be all ready n'Jt later
than Wednesday noon. The Walter
Hill company has donated the crates
for the packing of the peaches for
shipment
The request is that the peaches to
be contributed be firm, hand picked
and not too ripe. The fruit will be all
handled by the Walter Hill company
in crates best suited for transit to the
border.
It is planned to ship the peach pi
Wednesday SO that the soldiers wl.l
get them Thursday. There are 5.r0
men in the regiment and it will re
quire at least 50 boxes to give the
aoys even a taste.
A committee is to be appointed by
the Phoenix Red Cross for the pur
pose of providing tobacco for the men
of the First Arizona regiment This
matter will be taken up after the peach
day trk is finished.
AUSTRIAN ARRESTED;
TAKENJO DOUGLAS
Will Be Turned Over to Mili
tary Authorities To Be
Handled As A Deserter.
Antonio Marticich, an Austrian, who
was held in this city for a few days
pending the arrival of a department of
justice agent, has been taken to Doug
las by special agent Justin C. Daapit,
and will probably be turned over to
the military authorities for trial on
the charge of desertion from the Unit
ed States army on the ground of be
Tng a slacker. He has a brother work
ing in Brewery Gulch who's case will
also probably be investigated.
Marticich was arrested August 14
in Naco, after crossing the boundary
there from Mexico. His own story,
when questioned, was that he came
to Miami, Arizona, in September, 1915.
He said he had registered for the draft
on June 5, but had lost bis card. He
remained in Miami until July 14 on
which date he went to El Paso. Re
maining there nine days, he then left
for Naco. Arizona, where he stayed for
one night, going to Cananea the fol
lowing day. He said he remained in
Cananea until Saturday, August 11,
when he went to Nogales, and from
there to Naco.
The man-admitted that on August 9
he had been informed by the Ameri
can consul in Cananea that he had
been drafted and he should appear for
examination. He admitted also that
he did not leave his address with
anyone in Miami so notification of his
being drafted could be forwarded to
him. He admitted that he had decid
ed to go to Nogales, Sonora. there to
open a soft drink business and had no
intention of submitting to examination.
.At Naco, when he was placed in de
tention, he told the persons question
ing him that he had not registered
and that he bad been a resident of
Mexico since September or October,
1916. This was made before a United
States commissioned under oath. He
admitted to Mr. Daspit In the pres
ence of several witnesses yesterday,
that he had "lied in the belief that he
could get away with it."

Standing Up for Her
Country
The editor of the Review is in receipt of a most
remarkable letter from a Bisbee woman, a subscriber,
in which she asks him to help her reply to the tauntu
and jeers of a woman of German descent with whom
she had had an argument. ' This subscriber de
clares that she has had but little education and knows
but little of national or international affairs, and
therefore feels ill-fitted for the glad task of stand
ing up for her country.
To the editor's mind this woman's defense oi
her country and its institutions is as fine and effect
ive as that made by any statesman that ever pressed
his ear to the ground to listen for the faintest wh!b
per of a call to congress. . It may not glitter with deli
cate and edged repartee or shine under the poliph of
an eight years' course in a university, but it is funda
mental. It sprung from a heart that loves its coun
try and will make sacrifice untold for its glory.
. We would like to reproduce every word of this
patriotic outpourings of this woman's heart and soul
upon the altar of her country, but it is too long
However, we make not the slightest apology for
what we use here.
"I 'wais reading, the other " day in your paper,"
writes the woman, "that paft bt Gov. Campbell's
speech in which he said that he believed that it.
would soon be decided not to make any exemptions
w-hatever, for it now seems probable, unless this is
done, the draft will be a failure. When I had read
this far I looked up from my paper and said to a Get
man woman who was sitting in the room, that I be
lieved the governor was right, and it hurt me to ever,
think that this draft should fail. Now Is the tim"
for a true American to show his colors.
"The German woman replied: "No woman who
loves her husband would say that,'
"I answered that I loved my husband dearly and
devotedly, and I would hate to see him go, but if they
need him I will console myself the best way I can.
and say he is doing his duty for his country and for
me.
"Then she said: "What honor have your men
got to fight for? These American women make mc
tired; in my country it is an honor to fight, and a mar.
is never a man until he is a soldier. In your country
a soldier is a dog.'
"I declared that we were fighting for our govern
meht, our flag and the right of humanity, and anyone
who fights for these thlngsvis fighting for honor.
"And then this woman said to me: You may
have a government, but what good does it do you;
when they need money they have to go to the work
ingman to get It in the bhape of government bonds. In
my country they have everything ready for war long
before and train fheir males to fight from infancy.
I'd be ashamed of a thin government that had nothing
ready on time.'
"And then I was ashamed, for I did not know how
to answer this German. I am not smart. But I did
say to her that as she was loyal to her country she
must respect me for beiug loyal to mine. I was born
in the U. S. A., the best country on earth. It pro
duces everything under the sun and its people Invented
the airships and submarines and machine guns that
have kept Germany in the war. I am more than start
that I was born under Old Glory, the home of the brave
and the free. And as long as I have life I will Btani
by my country and her flag; and if they take all, my
husband and my brothers, and If they never return.
I'll say they fought for a noble cause.
I was only sixteen years old when I left home
and was married and I have been too busy with house
work and such things to have time to study as much
as I should and I do not understand these deep thing
of government, but if my government has made a few
mistakes, just remember this, a wise man makes mis
takes, but a fool never does. I have the utmost con
fidence In my government and its heads, and I rest
assured that they will do what is wise and well and all
will come out right in the end and Germany will get
what it deserves.
"She shifted her ground then and twitted ma
about talking about this being a free country and
asked me to account for it, when all those men were
taken ont of Bisbee July 12.
"I said, I may not answer you correctly, but you
seem under the impression that a man can do any
thing he wants to in a free country and still be free
We are free because we make our own laws and elect
our own men to carry out these laws. If they don't
do what is right and fair we elect other men. We do
not allow men to destroy towns in this country, even
if they are free men in a free country- And we do
not have to live under the rule of one family on down
through all its generations, good and bad.
"Now I have told you all about the principal parts
of our argument, and I am not sending it to you for
publication. I only want you to answer It with an
editorial and explain some points about our govern
ment and what 'free' means when applied to our
country. I will watch and wait for this and hope
you do not disappoint me, as It is hard enough to
have to take insults about your country, and I am
ashamed I did not have the proper education to an
swer them wise and correctly. But being ashamed
of my country NO, NEVER!
"If I am not smart, I blame myself, not my coun
try. And I am only asking you for a little light so if
ever again I get into an argument I will understand
more thoroughly my government Being a woman,
you may not consider my appeal."
OLD AGE.
BY GOSH I TEDDY'S LESSONS WERE RIGHT
Any light that we can make to shine upon this
great subject, madame, will be a mere taper flame of
sophistry compared to the sunlight of patriotism and
common sense with which you have already illum
inated it. You have stated a great principle and
clung closely to it all along with courage and deter
mination; Therefore you are right. You need no help
from any man or woman in this world, no matter how
wise or learned or famous they may be, when it
comes to defending your country from its enemies at
home or abroad. The woman who loves her country
and has faith in it and will make sacrifice for it, that
woman is thrice armed and Irresistible. She will
raise sons like Washington and Franklin and Jeffer
son and Lincoln.
Nancy Hanks was unlettered and unlearned, but
her great heart and soul and her force of character
and her practical good sense inspired her immortal
son to be the president of this nation and guide It
through the storm of the civil war.
Ah, madame, you tutf be unlearned, as you say,
but no Statesman since Pericles made Athens, a free
city ever uttered a greater or more profound truth
in defense of his country than you did when you de
clared: "And as long as I have life I will stand by
my country and her flag; and if they take all, my
husband and my brothers, and -if they never return,
I'll say they fought for a noble cause."
Countries have become great only because the
mothers of their heroes felt and spoke as you feel and
speak today. Napoleon's mother, Madame Bonaparte,
of Corsica, was neither a princess or a queen, but her
teachings and her indomitable , soul made her son a
king and the giver of kingdoms to all her other sons
If all our congressmen had your unselfish patriotism
the food bill "would have been passed in July and our
preparations for war would have begun with the last
term of congress instead of late in this term. Would
that Jeanette Rankin, the silly and hysterical racm
ber from Montana, had half of your good sense and
instinctive perceptions ior what is real and what is
froth and folly.
Your German woman jeers at America and its cus
toms and Institutions fcnd the principles for which it
goes to war. Why did she leave her beloved Ger
many, then, and coma to live in this country? Why
have tens of thousands of the best brains and strongest
arms of Germany been coming to this country every
year for over half a cantury? To escape tyranny an l
Prussianism; to win fortune and to be able to hold all
that they have won.
She spoke truly when she said that every man
in Germany was trained to fight, but ,she spake as
falsely as the mother of all liars when she said thai
these German soldiers were honored in her country.
They are slaves, dogs; poor brutes, driven by their
officers to slaughter like oxen to the shambles. Of all
soldiers in the world the German soldier bows to the
most terrible Iron discipline. Our American boys in
khaki are princes of the royal blood compaVed to the
privates of the crack corps of all the German empire.
Be sure of that.
Your German women also spoke truly when she
said her country had been making ready for war long
years before. And her rulers will answer for this be
fore the courts of eart: and the bar of heaven in such
fashion that their children will tremble down to the
saventh generation. And America was NOT makin;;
ready for war. To her honor and her glory be it so.
Peace, freedom and the pursuit of happiness these were
the things she has worked and builded for ever shue
the English and French and German refugees from the
misrule of kings came to these chores scking freedom
and wrote our constitution.
And she is fighting today for peace and freedom.
And women like you. madame. can help her more than
seven statesmen and seven teachers and seven talkers
that carried a diploma rway from a university.
Joan of Arc was an ignorant, unknown peasant
maid of France, but in her heart there burned an un-

You advanced an argument, madame,
worthy of a Gladstone or a TallyrauU

enough to kn'jw that it bad made them,
and to try to correct them, and thai
only a fool never makes mistakes. This

FALTIN 1Y BE HUNG ,
FOR HIS GRIME
That William Faltin, released from
the Arizona state hospital for the in
sane on Saturday upon certification by
Dr. John R. Wallis, superintendent of
that institution, and returned to the
Arizona state pri.s'on is still in the
shadow of the gallows, was tae opinion
generally expressed yesterday by law
yers and others familiar with the stat
utes. Notwithstanding that capital pun
ishment has been abolished in Arizona
through the adoption of a constitution
al amendment, it is the opinJbn gener
ally that In Faltin's case this amend
ment would have no bearing.
Governor Campbell on Saturday stat
ed that as soon as the return of Faltin
to the state prison as sane, had been
certified to him, he would Issue a com
mutation Vt the death sentence to life
imprisonment This he explained
would be done solely because he be
lieved that a vote having been regis
tered against capital punishment,
there should be no more hangings in
Arizona, even though through a strict
interpretation of the law hanging in
this case might legally be carried out
Whether County Attorney L. M.
Laney will take steps looking to hav
ing Faltin returned to the jurisdictio
of the superior court of Maricopa coun
ty, is uncertain. Mr. Laney has ad
mitted that he is looking Into the law
carefully but he is not yet decided
whether the situation calls for any ac
tion on the part 'of his office.
The party of prison officers who
came to Phoenix for Faltin and three
other prisoners to be returned to the
prison, consisted of S. E. Kent, assist
ant superintendent and captain of the
guards; John Redmond, secretary of
the prison; It. B. Aanderson, Harry
Campbell and James McVey. A report
received from the prison by telephone
Saturday night told of the safe arrival
in Florence of the entire party, the

employees of various stores in the j
camp will call on every merchant,
within the next few days.
The movement to shorten the Satur-j

and met with the hearty approval of
the largest stores in tho District. The :
action is endorsed by the Phelps
Dodge Mercantile Company, the Fair
Store, Schwartz Brothers Company,
J. B. Angius and by the F. W. Wool
worth Co., through its local manager,
Mr. Bovee.
Entire satisfaction in the plan has
been expressed by most of the em
ployers. "Without the co-operation of
the smaller shops in the closing plan
it will work a hardship on the larger
stores. This the employees commit
tee will seek to overcome by exact

to close.
The committee working on the plan
includes: L. D. Jackson, H. W. Eason,

a flower, fragrant with the dew of
praise for his simple work.

native of France will conduct classes
at the Y. M. C. A., Monday, Wednes
day and Friday evening, at 7:30 o'clock
for the benefit or drafted men in the

The entire country has become, sud

BISBEE AUTO COMPANY
(The Pioneer Garage)
Douglas Scribes
Still Boosting
Old Home Town
Major George H. Kelly, editor of the
Douglas Daily International and for
many years managing editor of The
Review, was a visitor in Bisbee, Sun
day with N. A. Patterson, business
manager of the International and also
a former Review man. That both
will have soft spots in their hearts for
the Warren District is shown by the
following article, which appeared in
The Daily International Monday even
ing: A visit to Bisbee yesterday after
noon by the editor of thi paper whs
one of the most interesting of a great
many during the last seventeen years.
There is a new spirit in Bisbee which
has caught the entire population. One
man said: "We are rapidly getting
back into normal condition." That is
not the word, and was probably meant
to apply only to the returning prosper
ity for which the way was paved on
the 12th of last month when the trou
blesome I. W. W. members and their
alliesnd sympathizers were deported.
For several years the normal condi
tion of Bisbee has been Bill Cleary
yawping on a soap box on some street
corner or in the city park, applauded
by a gang of trouble makers, who came
to the district for the purpose of bring
ing about industrial paralysis.
There is nothing like that in Bisbee
now and one of the impressive sights
yesterday evening was the open air
meeting at the city park where it
seemed that the entire population of
the Warren District had gathered;
every seat was taken and besides
hundreds and hundreds stood in among
and behind the seats and lined the
street above. The meeting had been
called by the Loyalty League and the
Citizens' Protective association, com
bined and those who were present had
left their church pews vacant and
abandoned every other Sunday even
ing duty to go to the park and give
the endorsement to the happenings in
the district recently. That vast as
semblage was enthusiastic and gave
unmistakeable testimony to the fact
that Bisbee had redeemed its beauti
ful city park from Bill Cleary and the
agitating wobblies and returned and
consecrated it to the loyal patriotic
citizens of the Warren District.

E COUNTY TO
HAVE THE LOWEST TAX
RATE IN ARIZONA
The tax rate for Cochise county for
the year 1!17 has been hxed by the
board of supervisors at 36 cents per
(100. The rate was apportioned as fol
lows: 18 cents for the general fund;
7 cents for the road fund, and 10
cents for the schools. The state rate
being fixed at 53 cents per $100 will
make the combined state and county
rate 89 cents. It was expected by in
board and Clerk Karger that the rate
would be considerable lower this year
than last and, in fact, the county rate
is 7cents lower. But the state rate
having been increased the total rate
shows an increase Vf 6 cents over last
year.
Cochise county will continue to have
the lowest rate of any county in the
state, at that, and will keep its record
that it has bad for the past five years.
The Maricona rate will be J1.08 and
Pima couny $1.70. The other counties j
have not been beard from. The lower-.
ing of the rate in Cochise county
speaks well for the management of the '
county affairs by the present board of
supervisors and their efficient clerk.
CITY COUNCIL HOLDS
MID-MONTH MEETING
Little Business Comes Before
City Fathers. Short Session
Is Result ; !
Improvement in the city, with no
trouble except the constant and un
ending street and sewer work, is re
flected in the city council meeting
which are brief, active and efficient.;
Last evening the semi-monthly gath
ering met, discussed routine business
for a short time and adjourned at 8:30
o'clock.
On motion of Councilman Delbridge,
who determined through the sewer in
spector, A. E. Sheppard, that the city
reservoir and tanks were nearly full.
it was decided to ask the city bacteriol
ogist, Dr. R. B. Durfee, to inspect the
water and if it is found to be free
from contamination to turn it in the
city's drinking fountains at various
points in the community.
In order to dispose of several par
cels of property, which have value but
are of little use to the city of Bisbee,
Mayor Efickson, as trustee of the
townsite, appointed a board Tf three
supervisors last evening to examine
and report to him in the near future.
Jim Powell, city assessor, was made
he"ad of the appraising board.

Mining and Financial News
BY REVIEW LEASED WIRE
(By Review Leased Wire.)
NEW YORK, August 21. Tracers
made free use today of various devel
opments calculated to exert an unfav
orable influence upon the stock mar
ket. Chief of these were the more
definite policy outlined by the govern
ment toward the coal roads and pro
ducers and the urgent financial re
quirements of equipment and muni
tions companies. New low records for
Delaware and Hudson and New Haven
at 100 and ZOVt, respectively, were
not without their sentimental effect.
New York Central, Reading, Caradian
Pacific, Chicago and Northwestern, At
lantic Coast Line ar.d many of the
low priced rails also made gross re
cessions of one to two points.
Bethlehem Steel new stocks bore
the brunt of the concerted drive
against industrials, its extreme loss
of six points with a later rally of two
resulting from Incessant selling based
on reports regarding new financing.
Related shares yielded one to three
points. United States "Steel faring bet
ter than others of the same class on
its net loss of to 1 points, at 123.
Total sales 528,000 shares.
Calling of loans by some of the big
financial Institutions and private
bankers created a firmer tone in call
money, but time rates were easier.
Bonds were lower in the main, the
Liberty issues showing steadiness,
however, at 99.80 to 99.84.
Total sales, par value, $2,690,000.
United States bonds, old issues,
were unchanged on call.
1 CHICAGO GRAINS.
CHICAGO. August 21. Firmness
displayed by corn early in the day
when depleted holdings were enlarged
lost its. force later on free selling and
nrices which advanced about cents
above yesterday's closing figures, sag
ged below that level. Short covering
late In the session followed the ab-
sorotion of the offerings and prices ral
lied. The close was steady 18 lower
to higher with December at 108
to 108 and May 107. Wheat finished
steady at 210, an advance of five cents
overnight. Oats at the close were
higher to 4 lower. Provisions held
firm, ruling from unchanged to fifteen
cents higher.
Weather conditions in the corn
states were generally as beneflcia
with rains In different localities in
the central sections. Cash demand
was better but there was a compare
tive absence of news to attract trad
ers attention. Shipping sales were
placed at 30.000 bushels.
Small amounts of wheat changed
hands to even up outstanding - con
tracts in September, the only option
month.'
Provisions made fair gains, the $20
hog which appeared today In the yards
as a new hog record, encouraging buy
ing. October lard was the most ac
tive commodity.

NEW YORK, August 21. Washing
ton dispatches intimating that the
American government will probably
indorse a loan to Mexico by American
Bankers inspired more confidence in
the shares of American Companies
having large interests In the Southern
Republic. Good gains were noted in
Mexican Petroleum; American Smelt
ers and United States Mining and
Smelting, there was very little activity
in the other departments with the ex
ception of Bethlehem "B" which shows
a net loss for the day of four points
on report that the preferred stock to
be Issued would be 50,000,000.
We believe that long industrials li
quidated at this level can be replaced
to advantage later on.

eppelim la Downed
In the Austit-Italian theatre the
terrific drive of the Italians is causing
the Austrian line to crack at numer
ous points. The Austrians are resist
ing vigorously. The battle is proceed
ing without interruption, Austrian de
fenses between Corite and Selo and
near the strongly fortified Starllokva
position are among the places cap
tured. Up to Monday night more than
10,000 prisoners had been taken, not
counting 243 officers.
The Russians in Galicia and Buko-
wlna are apparently holding their own
against the Austrians and Germans,
but in Rumania the Russians and Ru
manians have been compelled to cede
further ground near the village of
Cona and east of the Fokshani-Nara-cone-Ajui
railway.
The intensive aerial fighting between
the allies and the Germans in France
continues. Numerous German ma
chines have been bi'ought down in
aerial battles, but the entente allies
also have lost a considerable number
of machines. British warships have
destroyed a German, Zeppelin off the
coast of Denmark, the entire crew-perishing.

Verdun Front Active
PARIS, Aug. 21. The battle of Ver
dun has not yet ceased, and on the
left bank of the Meuse the French
troops have captured several import
ant points, including the village of
Regnevllle. On the right bank the
French have occupied Samogneux and
carried a system of fortified trenches
which links this place up with Hill 344
The official report from the war office
announcing the success says that all
German counter attacks have been re
pulsed.
The statement says:
"On the Verdun front the battle (coa-
tinued today at several points and de
veloped everywhere to our advantage.
On the left, bank of the Meuse 'our
troops captured Cote 1'Oie, which we
occupied in its entirety, as well as the
village of Regneville.
"On the right bank in the course of
a brilliant attack we took Samogneux
and a whole system of fortified
trenches which connects this village
with the organizations on Hill 344. Ger
man counter attacks were repmseo.
We took additional prisoners who have
not yet been counted."

of the south's greatest newspapers
The Birmingham Age-Herald.
Writing to a personal friend in At
lanta. Mr. Evans Says:
"Birmingham. Ala., Feb. 2. 1916.
. . By the way, yVu will
hardly know me when we meet again
because I am getting well and strong '
again. As I told you while In Atlanta ;
last month, I have been suffering a
long time with gastritis, as the doctors i
call It really a disordered stomach ,
with consequent constipation, pains in
the shoulders, ' headache, belching.,
heartburn, loss of appetite, 1jss of,
sUep and fainting spells. For weeks
I could not sleep on my back.
"One week ago, upon recommenda
tion of friends, who had tried the
medicine, I purchased one bottle of
Tanlac and began taking it. Since my
second dVse I have suffered none of
these troubles to which I refer, and
really believe I am going to get per
fectly well and strong again. Won't
that be wonderful at my ageT Well,
certain it is that Tanlac is a wonder
ful medicine, and you know that I am
not given to 'puffing' mere experi
ments and am rather orthodox as tv
materia medica. .
"I shall continue the treatment with !
perfect confidence In the final results. ,
(Signed) "FRANK V. EVANS." I
Commenting on this Bplendid en-i
dorsement of Tanlac, G. F. Willis,
southern distributor of Tanlac, said:
"Although the list of prominent en
dorsers is a Vane one. I recall a few
it two or three days in succession. He
did this yet without result. We became
desperate, he suffered so. He was swol
len terribly. He told me his suffering
could only be described as torture.
I sant and bought Thedford's Black
Draueht I made him take a big dose,
and when it began to act he feinted, he ,
was in such misery, but he got re:el and ,
began to mend at once. He got well.j
and we both feel he owes his life to
Thedford's Black-Draught." j
Thedford's Black-Draught will help you 1
to keep fit, ready for the day's work.

On the southwest the Canadians
were equally successful after very
heavy fighting. The British artillery
was brought into play. The most
strenuous fight of the day was in the
centre of the line west of Lens on a
front near the left of the northwest
positions, but the whole line was a
seething caldron.
The Canadians ' have gained their
objective, drawing their lines still
closer about Lens and are about to
gain their goal. By today's attack the
Canadians have gained possession of
many embankments and colliery posi

for other offensive operations.

struggle with hand bombs and bayo

selves upon the enemy with such a
rush and fierceness that the Germans

step the Canadians advanced until
they had advanced their position to a
depth of several hundred yards and
taken up new positions which they are
holding against counter thrusts.
The opposing forces are now fight

the Germans had fortified themselves

company have passed a resolution that
pending action of the United States
government, this tympany will provide
temporary financial aid to dependents
of employes who, with leave of absence
from the company for that purpose,
either voluntarily or involuntarily,
have entered or do hereafter enter the
army on naval service of the United

reception. It happened in Tucson last
Monday. Mrs. MacLean was Miss Eli
nor BediPow and the wedding took
place at the home of her parents, Mr.
and Mrs. Watkin Beddow. Only a
few relatives of the bride and friends
of both parties were present The mar
