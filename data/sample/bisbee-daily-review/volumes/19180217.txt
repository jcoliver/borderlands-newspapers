and tha shipbuilding labor adjustment
board handed down a wage award cov
ering Delaware riTer and Maryland
shipyards which will form the basis
of a general eastern shipbuilding wage
scale.
The president is expected to express
definite Tiews oa the situation in re
ply to a telegram be received tonight
from William L. Hutcheson. president
of the brotherhood of carpenters and
Joiners, asking an opportunity person
ally to put the situation before him.
Other developments in connection
with the strikes during the day were:
Other Developments
Indications that the heads of other
unions will not support Hutcheson's
position and assurances from New
York metal workers that they will con
tinue work awaiting an adjustment by
the wage adjustment board.
A statement by the shipping board
that no effort will be made lo coerce
the strikers by .hre -train-; to call
them into the military service.
A declaration by Chairman Fletcher
of the senate commerce committee, in
vestigating shipping, ihat the govern
ment should take ot. r the operation
of all shipyards and fix a general
wage scale.
A request by shipyaids that they be
permitted to crush the strike in their
own way.
Carpenters Alone
Hutcheson's refusal to leave a set
tlement to the labor adjustment board
drew from officials r-l the board to
night ine statement that the carpen
ters' organization, alouc of all the
trades engaged is shipbuilding, has de
clared to let it adjust difficulties.
Officers of the Ame ican Federation

Capture Is Imminent.
Tom and John Powers and Torn

with hundreds of deputies c!oe
on their trail, facing probability
of capture at any moment. Last
minute advices indicate that ths
murderers crossed the Chiraca
huas yesterday morning or Friday
night, and are now on the eastern
slope of the range. Sheriff
Wheeler, who is leading the chp.se,
communicated with his office
last evening.
At an early hour yesterday
morning with trained bloodhounds
the sheriff and his men took up
the trail of the fugitives at the
Vernie Young ranch, located in
Rock Creek, where the' mur;i
ers. on Friday night, abandoned
their horses and saddles and took
to the mountains on foot.
. Over the Top.
Immediately the dogs led the posse
op Rack Creek and then by a circui
tous, tortuous and, at times, snow
covered, unmarked trail, mounted the
top of the Chiracahuas. The murder
ers had sought the highest and most
inacessible places in the mountains,
going into the Rustler Park country
and finally dropping Ko one ot the
three branches of Cave Creek.
Though it la not known where th
fugitives left Cave Creek, it is thought
that it must have been somewhere
near the Reed ranch. From this point
the men struck north, over the moun
tain again and toward Paradise. When
nightfall overtook the hardworking
posse and dogs the trail pointed near
ly north.
Preparations were immediately
made to guard every part of the north
eastern region of the Chiracahuas.
especially in the neighborhood cf
Paradise and the San Simon country.
By a process of elimination of the
country, over which the outlaws have
gone, the officers, increasing day by
day as the chase continues, the rap
ture of the fugitives seem inevitable.
Practically every part of the moun
tains is well guarded. Every trail and
bypath is being wat:hed Hundreds
of armed men are covering the ad
vance and retreat of the murderers.
Soldiers from Douglas, numbering
several hundred, have left their post

Tbe report by a national committee chairman upon
the Y. W. war work made In this Issue of The Review
in the form of an interview, should be read and carefully
considered by all readers who hare their country's good
at heart. It is a close up view of this wonderful work,
given first hand by a lady who has lived a part of every
year in the southwest and knows how to deliver a mes
sage in words and terms that the southwest can under
stand and in which it can have faith.
And there is still no word as to when the quarantine,
both within the district and against the district, will b
Kfted. A case of smallpox developed this past week
seems to have indefinitely postponed the date of relief.
It would seem to th? ordinary, practical, common
sense plug citizen of a layman that if this embargo up
on society, pleasure and business is not to be lifted un
til there is no such thing as smallpox along the border
that it will remain In full force and effect for a rather
indefinite period. That all danger cf an epidemic has
passed no one can doubt. Too. much hardship and in
convenience and loss of business are being suffered by
tbe entire district to keep this stern and drastic regula
tion in force an hour longer than is an absolute and im
perative necessity.
A Bisbee lady, calling in over the telephone to en
dorse the recent editorial regarding the high price of
bran, wishes To supplement the same with the declaration
that cornmeal is now selling at twenty cents a pound.
Shades cf the first Indians that planted corn in the
American wilderness! To what pass have we come
when the corn pone; the poor man's friend and standby;
the simple, humble, cheap old slab of cornbread, must
be paid for at t rate of twenty cents per pound? And
navy beans, too, the faithful comrade and plebian blood
brother of cornmeal, these, too, have ascended from the
common ranks to the proud brotherhood or the nobility
of sugar and wheat and porterhouse st-aKs of the old
days. These latter are now In the clouds and cannot
be seen at all. But how, pray, is a simple plug citizen
to economize at all when beans and cornmeal fail him
in his dire extremity? Again, boy, page Mr. Hoover,
and page him until he answers the call.
Sunday Morning Sermon
It comes home closer every day, does the fact tha
the recent supreme court decision placed the state gov
ernment In tbe bands of a politician wno aas learned
nothing and can forget nothing. The last offense is the
interference with. Cochise county road building by the
state engineering department, recently created for politi
cal and not read building purposes. Our road camp is
riosed and the state funds and help which are ours,
furnished by us and apportioned to ns by law, withheld
from our uses. The stand of the county commissioners
in this matter will be approved by nine property owners
out of ten in the county. And much more serious and
far-reaching than our road funds and work, is the fact
that this nation is at war, and this is our war governor.
As a man is in small matters, so he is in great ones.
No, The Review editor did not make any mistake or
overlook any previous news items in his psper. as has
been rather spitefully Intimated, when he declared in a
recent editorial that there was no information available
in the distrirt regarding certainty of employment in any
' particu'ar shipyard. For the carpenter or joiner who
wants work right now in a shipyard, there is nothing to
do but make application, be listed and wait. No one here
knows of a call from any certain yard for a certain
number of men for any specific work. It Is all general
ized, this shipbuilding wcrk, up to this time, and not
specifi-, definite or certain. R. J. Wilbert, miner in this
dixrict, who volunteered to aid T. J. Oroaff. state di
rector, in enrollment o the shipbuilding army, called
upon the editor yesterday and the matter was discussed
at length. Mr. Wilbert: and Jack Dym. both miners,
have agreed to give their time to this work for nothing.
They alternate at Vnioa hall from noon to two-thirty,
and from five to seven p. ni.. and will accept enroll
ments and list the men for service in building ships. But
they have no information as yet as to exactly when and
where these men will be reeded. Thert has been much
delay in all matters pertaining to the shipbuilding pro
gram. Only since Hurley assumed charge Ins there
bren a real effort made at practical organization and con
dud cf its affairs. Air. WUIert is convinced, fr-m 'us
own information at band, that the work will be pushed
anl the organization perfected Iroro uw on. He ex
pects to r-on re:eive the desired information as to mhere
an l rn m-n are wanted to re pert. As soon as he re
K ivrj :t vf will give it out in The Rev.ew. He also be
lief i that if labor is g ven a chance to volunteer "or
fuis nt-rU ' a' ccrv.-riplfcn ill rot be Eeceary.
"And the Lord said unto Gideon. By the three
hundred men that lapred will I save you and de-
liver the Midtanites Into thine hand; and let all
the other people go, every man to his place."
Judges 7-13.
Every one has heard of Gideon's .Band. These
heroes haTe been praised by poet and lauded by song
and heralded in story all through the ags. and they will
be held as the bravest of the brave until time shall end.
The Midianitea had overrun Israel and their number?
and their successes had ccwed th Hebrews until it was
impossible to get an army to go forth against them.
Then it Vas that God spoke to Gideon and told him to
go and fear not.
Gideon led forth an army towards the camp of the
Midianitea. And God spoke to him again and told him
to go forward with onl those' men that knew not fear.
Gideon lost twenty-seven thousand men here when he
made this calL He went on with ten thousand. Again
God called upon him to test his men. Only those who.
after the long march, lapped water from their hands
were to go. Nine thousand, seven hundred bowed down
to drink. Gideon went on with the three hundred who
were tireless and indomitable.
Tiese were the men who composed Gideon's Band.
These were tSe men selected by God and Gideon to go
down to the Midmnite camp of thousands and smite
'hem and drive them like chaff before the gale and gain
everlasting glory.
Do yon belong to Gideon's Band? Are you among
the first twenty-seven thousand who drew back because
of fear? Because the path was beset by dangers? Be
cause the odds against you were heavy? Because the
hill was so steep? Because the spray of the tempest
was white in the air? If you were you ought not to com
plain because you have been buried in the sands of ob
livion; because you are lost among and jostled by the
commonplace. You are wnere you elected to be.
Are you among the nine thousand, seven hundred who
swallowed their fears and pressed on, only to fail under
the test of the drinking of the water from the stream?
If you are you have done well and will be named with
those who dared. But you ave failed the final fest.
"With the three hundred men that lapped will I save
you," said the Lord to Gideon. You bowed down to
drink. You sousht the easiest way. You turned to the
point of least resistance. You tried, but you did not try
your level best.
But those three hundred men who came down to the
Ftrtfam and. in sp-te of their fatigue and the toil of their
all night march, proudly lifted the water in their hands
and lapped it, these men were chosen .to go forward to
the paths cf glory that only the great and the true shalt
tread. Iron men. Dauntless men. Men wnoe spirit was
so high that it triumphed over their weak and frail
bodies and bade them stand and not bow down.
The men of Gideon's Band did not win to that death
less fame because of their good looks or their high
les fame because of their good looks or their high
connections or 'their luck or their desires. They won
because they excelled all the host of other men who
started out with them upon the glory road.
The story of Gideon's men is as simple as it is old.
One must not only be brave enotigh to press on to the
brink of the stream that separates him from the acme
cf success, but he must have that last ounce cf reserve
force; that final effort; that spirit that will not fail
and that body that will not bend where there is life left.
He must do all be can do and then do yet more.
It is so easy to bow down and drink from the cup of
ease and it is so hard to hold the head high under the
strain cf, weariness and depression. We give up so
often alien in sight of the goal. We stop just shorfof
the laurel crown.
Tor tbe things most desired'of earth tfiere is always
that last stream to cross to come to them. Onlv the
dauntless few of Gideon's Band crossed to gain them.
Do net envy these men. They earned their regard.

Luis. The newspaper man combeu it
frcm the eyebrows to the back of the
neck and could not find even a clew.
Then he tried the girl at tbe telephone
office. Bing! The rest was as easy
as shooting fisA. She knew a girl
down on Onion creek who had started
'.he whole thing on an endless chain
of letters plan at the Onion Creek
Sewing society one pleasant autumn
day. The newspaper man got this
girl on the rurai telephone. She owned
up. Why? OA. just because. A
month ago she had nursed a woman
wit.i sinaltpox who said she had con
tracted the disease while in Topeka.
And this simple country girl had
laid down the milk pail and the
churn and taken up the pen. and.
writing from the little cabin in the
clearing on Onion creek, had upset a
large city and caused anxiety in the
state capital and worried a group ot
the big business men of her state
until they did not know which way
to turn. Her sewing society, by ex
peniing a dollar In stamps, had been
in a (air way to cost Topeka town
some thirty thousand dollars.
"It is as easy to spread a smallpox
stare as it is to break an egg. and
almost as hard to make right again.
But the story of the beginning of
that scare, played up by all the p
pers. saved the day. and Topeka bad
her fair. Yet to this day the moral
of it Impresses the newspaper man
cf the far-reaching and vital effect
upon great things, for either good cr
evil, that are often had by small and
humble beginnings. The part that an
humble and average citizen plays in
his community and state is often more
important than he Imagines. So he
ought to be careful of what he does
or says; cf the example he sets; of
tbe tales he bears; of the things for
which he takes a stand and the things
he 3tands against. His home, his
town and theirs and his own good
name are in his hands, and his hands
alone.

"As soon as it rains." said Dick Ry
an, county engineer, to the newspaper
man early in last month, "we are '
going to fix up the road to the Hua
chucas." Now. the newspaper man is
a great admirer of the county engi
ceer. He believes that this person
is a wizard at about everything to
which he turn his deft and supple
paw to do. So when the snows and
i'le rains came later in the month,
this newspaper man curried his
woolly flivver one bright Sabbath day
and pointed its nose to the mountains.
But evidently the Hon. Ryan had
not bad time to get to that Hereford

The Euroiean edition of the New York Herald, dis
cussing the war in a strong editorial, declares that with
the close of the year 1917, many Englishmen who had
wagered on the duration of the war, paid their bets and
that so far this year the betting on the length of the war
is very light. It is the pretty general opinion in London
that tbe war will end iq April. 1919. Continuing, the
editorial say3: Ask the average Englishman of standing
bout the war. and he will presumably say: "Oh, the
United States and England will finish It up. France will
never give up, but she has done her bit already and can
not be expected to give much! more of her waning
strength. She did her share on many battle fields. Now
it is the task of England and the States to bring it all
to a finish and UAcy mav be counted on to do it." Great
Britain is counting heavily on the vitality and resources
of the Unrted States. There is a much more amiable
feeling now than formerly toward the "Land of the Al- I

Warren, Wonder City of the
Southwest--- What Has Been
Done and Is Yet to Do
f r. U JJ LI D
wver wne iiunurca uuvuei duui lucre laii ci jiu a uau
menls But it Ought to
Lighted Rents Too High
What are YQU going to do. Mister
i rmn kolk .,rt
owner, renter or roomer, ft does not
matter whicA- about vonr home town
of Warren? Here i one of the won-j
in a natural vista in the mountains.
and as beautiful and picturesque a
townsite as man could hope to find
in a week's ride upon a transconti
nental train!
Besides the advantage of location as
an ideal suburb for the city of Fisbee.
Warren has a distinct claim of its own
for permanent growth and prosperity.
The Copper Queen is building a great i
cendensor mill within a quarter of a
mile of the townsite. This mill will
represent an expenditure of more than
a million dollars and will employ a
great many men. Any disadvantage
to the town arising from its unsightli
ness or noise and horn of industry
will be hidden from the town by a
hill, yet it Is close enough to make
Warren the best place for its work
men and office force and engineers
and foremen to live.
Did yon know that 104 modern an
bandcme bouses were built in War
ren la year at a cost of more than
COO .000? It is a fact- Warren has
doubled in population and improve
ments in the past three years. Ovet
2000 people now dwell within its bor
ders. Most of those own their own
homes.
Did you know that the Warren com
pany expended $20,000 on streets and
$2000 on parks and $15,000 on sewer
and water systems in Warren last
year alone? It is a fact. And a new
echool house costing $20,000 was built
there last year, and the C. & A. hos
pital, costing $100,000, is Hearing com
pletion, and it stands, a handsome
monument of steel and concrete, upon
a hill above this wonder vista in the
mountains, looking down upon the
long rows of bungalows and cottage
roofs that gleam red and green and
white in the streaming sunshine.
And there is a demand right now
for 100 more houses in Warren. Rents
are too high and houses too scarce
there. This beautiful wonder town
has drawbacks, too, and handicaps. It
Is poorly lighted and its streets are
not worthy the name, and cf side
walks it has none at all.
What are yon going to do about It?
"CMi, let the company do It, j-ou1
say.
But you will kill the goose that laid
the golden egg; you will ride a free
hors-e to death. You must do your
part, tea If Warren was incorporat
ed your municipal expenses there
would double, and your taxes, too.
You would be compelled to grade
streets and sidewalks and install
lights and replace ditches with cul
verts and clean up the trash and keep
the cows and burros at home.
But the question is. Can Warren be
beautiful and improved and made
more attractive and sishtly without
incoporating into a city? It will cost
much lefs to do this without bee tun j
ing an incorporated city. But will the
Citizens work together and do it? !
Right now one citizen pays SO cents
a month to have his garbage taken
away, and his neighbor throws bis
garbage in the street or back yard.
One citizen builds a fence and fixe
up his yard. Xext door is a bouse
with no fence and a yard that is a
dumping ground for trash and grazing
ground for cows.
The few street lights in Warren and
its sewer system were installed and
- maintained by the Warren company
without cost to the residents. A
garhace plant and wagons are fur
nished by the company and this serv
ice to the householder is onlv 50 cents
a mcnth, YET NOT OXE-TKIRD OF
THE RESIDENTS TAKE ADVAN
TAGE OF IT! This neglect and petty
economy on the part of so many to
ple tend to nullify the efforts of those
ho are trym? to keep the town clean
and subtly and sanitary. It is incon
ceivahle why any good citizen should
detim? to take advantaee of this gar
base eervice at this most nominal
price.
There are two classes of people in
every town; these who pull their
weight in the boat and the
dead -
heads.
One man tn;s to build a side
walk, but what's the use if his neigh
hor will not?
One man fills a ditrh
in workmanlike shape and another
man d.gs one ana leaves it open. in

married men and have families. They
want houses in which to live. They
want to bring their wires and chil

Music
Have you, in the night's fall.
Heard the mother's lul-la-by.
And, having heard the heart's call,
The infant ceased to cry?
Have you, down on the farm,
Heard the mocking bird inhe morn
From out the sky with music charm, . . ,'
And proclaim the day new born?
Have you, under the golden moon.
Heard the lover's whisper, "1 love you,"
Then the kiss and know that soon
To each they'd be forever true?
Have you, from down in the dell,
Heard the clarion call of the cock;
The thrush it's evening story tell;
The neighs, moos, and baas of the flock ?

hill to uncover the body of ore be
neath is a man's sized task and will
tst two years, according to Sup.
Gerald Sherman, of the Copper Queen.
v,,,,,, of ,ne orw miU uncoTer.d be-
fore that time, but it is expected to be
two years or more from the time work
started before enoueh has been ex
posed to start milling it.
It is planned to erect a 3000-ton
mill which will handle a mi'.l'on tons
of ore annually. This means that it
, will require seven and a half years
to mill "Sr.c" hill's ore body, as the
reserve there is estimated at seven
and a -sa'f mi'.lions tons.
T'.:e ere is a hish grade porphyry
; which averages about two and a quar-
ter per cent copper, according to
; tests. A high percentage of recovery
is expected.
I Work on "Sac" hill records the first
t;n;o in the Warren District that steam
Loiel operations have been used to
j handle the ore from the top instead
i of tunneling and sinking shafts.
Overcome Obstacles.
, Many obstacles have been encount
j ered, but these have been, and are be
j in oercome. as they are met and
i while the removal of the crest of 'Sac"
hill has been slower than expected,
the wcrk will move much faster when
the peak is removed so that addition
al tracks can be laid and more
shovels put into operation. At pres
ent only two shovels can be used.
Another feature of the work which
has adJed to the difficulties is that
all of the blasts have to be fired on
the side opposite the Xaco road.
Ten days were required to drill the
24 toe holes In which the blasts of
last Tuesday were shot off. Owing
to the h'gh bench, which is 120 feet,
the work Is more dangerous than it
will be later when it will be possible
to decrease the height of the benches
to approximately feet.
To date there have been two un
avoidable accidents on "Sac" hill, due
Jto premature explosions, which have

even greater precautions are now be
ing taken and it is hoped to avoid any
further accident.
Expert Powder Men.
Working on "Sac" hill are some of
the best powder men in the country,
while the powder used is rated as the
least dangerous to handle of any that
(can be procured which will do the re
quired wxrk.
Every possible effort to mimmixe
the danger to the workmen is taken
and pf rtly ror this reason the hill has
not been demolished as rapidly as ex
pected and the wcrk is slishtly behind
schedule. This is due also to the ob
stacles encountered in the nature of
fissures in the rock which have caus
ed trouble in drilling hides in which
to place the chsges of powder for the
blasts.
The surface of the hill is extremely
hard, but fissures where the forma
tion is broken and soft streaks occur
often cause the fining up of holes
(Crilitd when the softer rock crumples.
j The distance from the top of tie
hill down to the ore body is 150 fet
iu places, while this varies in other
locations to from 60 to 73 feet. Sv
curiiig dumps for all of tis waste
w'.rch Is beinit taken off from the top
of "Sfcc" hill, has proved .ur-te a prjl

Mine Workers Share
Greatly in Income
Of Copper Compan ies
Prominent Visitor From the East Declares That Agitation
and Misrepresentation Must Be Met, on the Part of In
dustry, by Counter Attacks. Points Out That the Work
er Draws a Big Part of All Earnings in His Wages
GIRLS MAKE SMALL PARTS FOR U. S. A EROPLA XES
The increasing scarcity of real money coin; toe high percentage of gross
Income the workingman is receiving; the necessity lor preparing for the
after-war period by putting all industries on as strong an operating basis
as possible, and doing everything to develop additional resources for their
future, were points put first in discussion by a prominent eastern banter
of things the public needs consider. Declining his name because he said it
might lead some to wrongly argue that his motives in speaking were selfish,
this visitor said:
"1 believe, however, that we should all be telling the public what we
see and know, and thy combat the efforts of those who would! make dis
satisfaction with present employment and cause strikes and delays to our
wort We withdraw. before the labor agitator, when we should get out and
combat his false theories and too often intentional falsehoods. Instead, we
stand upon our dignity and keep silent. How can we blame those who hear
but the one side if they believe it? The time la coming when we will have
to get on the soap box ourselves and combat the soap-box orator of today
give' the people both sides and make them know that we are one of them
Just as U the other fellow. We pay millions for schools, but refuse to do
any of the .teaching ourselves. Fe have been criminally negligent in not
discarding false pride, getting on the soap box. teaching and overcoming
prejudice that we have let grow up.
"I spoke of the scarcity of money. I mean that the public is drawing
coin out of circulation all over the world, hoarding It in belief that paper
money will soon see general depreciation, as it has in Russia and Germany.
Then, we are drawing enormous sums into bond issues. Not only th work
ingman,, but every man needs to push on the wheels of industry in order
that we do not lose a dollar from our production of wealth, for we are going
to need every cent of all the wealth we can make.
"Every dissatisfied man sulking on the Job, every striker, is putting
the end of the war further off and increasing after-war financial and social
dangers which will have to be faced when the people of the world come to
realise the enormous financial bnrden with which they have been shouldered
In the struggle for democracy and the ready money It has taken from their
se.
Needs Hs Head
"Every'worklngman needs keep his head and realize when he listens
to the agitator that the worklngmen are receiving the highest percentage
of gross receipts of industries in the world's history. Take the copper in
dastry in Arizona. The lowest figure Is I have seen on its prevailing wages
is $42,000,000 the year. Do the man in our mines, mills and smelters
realize that on that rate of pay they are receiving, without a cent of invest
ment, financial risk or business endeavor, 25 per cent of gross Income from
the 700,000,000 pounds of copper being made annually in 'Arizona? And if
fair charge is added for depreciation of the mines, then they are receiving
33 per cent of the gross income.
"On the other hand, interest paid for money -in the copper industry
through dividends has been reduced to an average of less than 7 per cent
by the price fixed for copper. Yon cannot go into a bank is tb wesQ and
get money for less than 10 per cent. Fifteen per cent was considered neces
sary from a mining investment, because of the element of risk. This has
been more than cut in two, averaging the copper producers throughout.
"Another important point that is not generally considered is that divi
dends do not represent pure profits from mining. In part they include re
turn of borrowed capital nsed in opening and equipping the mine and inter
est thereon. Much less than 7 per cent profit is therefore being received
by the investor who made the copper mines possible, taking all the risk,
making all the employment, as compared with the 33 per cent of gross
Income from these mines which the workingman is now receiving and which,
among other things, includes a 44 per cent wage increase since the pre-war
period.
Carl Harden, Arizona's representative in congress, has introduced a bill
to authorize coal mining leases in the Navajo country.
This bill provides that all coal and other minerals within tha limits of
the Navajo, Pueblo, San Juan, Western Navajo and Mogul reservations in
Arizona and New Mexico, except that part of the Moqul reservations In
Arizona which may hereafter be set apart for the exclusive use and ben en t
of the Hopl Indians, shall remain the common property of the Navajo tribe,
and every member of said tribe shall have an equal and individual interest
In the whole of said coal and other minerals.
The secretary of the interior is authorized to advertise for lease parcels
of said lands in 40-acre tracts or multiples of 40 acres, no tract to be larger
than 2560 acres. That the lessee, for the privilege of mining the coal, will
pay to the United States government for the benefit of the Navajo Indians
such, royalties as may be specified in the lease, which shall be not less than
10 cents per ton.
An annual rental shall be paid also, based on a eliding scale, beginning
with 25 cents per year per acre for the first year. 10 cents per acre for the
second and third years, and $1 per acre for every yrar thereafter until the
expiration of the lease. The rental paid each year shall be credited against
the royalties that accrue for that year.
The bill was referred to the cemtnlttee en Indian affairs for eonsMera
at tea.

It has been learned for a certainty
that the purchase of the Butte
Monitor Tunnel company property by
W. D. Thornton of New York for
$150,000 was for the North Butte com
pany. As :ie propeny is located in the
neighborhood of ground secured up
wards of a year ago by the same com
pany and is in the vicinity of proven
mineral ground if is evident that the
North Butte company within the next
few months intend to considerably
increase its production by the open
ing up and developing of the new
properties.
Notwithstanding the heavy loss
sustained by the fire in the Granite
Mountain and the consequent large
curtailment in operating the company
is in good financial position and the
new properties when once put in op
eration will add considerably to the
earning power -of the company.
Anaconda
Every effort is being made to have
the rod and wire plant of the Ana
conda company, in the course of con
struction at Great Falls, ready for
operation by the first of May.
The building will be 400 feet long
by 125 feet wide and will be of brick
and steel. It will have a capacity o
200.000 pounds of copper rods and
S5.000 pounds of copper wire, working
eight hours. This means that the
want will consume one-fifth of the
production of the Anaconda com
pany. Should it be considered necessary at
any time to increase the capacity of
the plant all that is required is the
working of a night shift.
The Anaconda company has added
four new roasters to the tine plant,
and this will mean that a portion of
the roasting of ores in the sine plant,
previously done at the Washoe, works
at Anaconda, will be transferred to
the plant in Great Falls.
Ten roasters are already being
operated at Great Falls and the ad
ditional ones will bring the total up
to 14. This will give the zinc plant
an Increase from 6.000,000 pounds
monihly to 8.000,000 pounds of zinc
monthly.
The Anaconda company during the
pat month had a payroll of practi
cally $1,750,000. which includes miners
and surface men.
Every one of the 33 producing prop
erties ts working to capacity and the
stnolters are empMylng their full
quota of men. Some of to men em
ployed are not the equal of the old
miners employed previous to the
troubles of last June, but they are
fast becoming proficient in their work.
Agitators are once more endeavor
ing to stir up strife and they are cir
culating among the miners urging
them t ojoint an agitatibn for six
hours' work a day and $6 a da
wages. They are adopting about the
same tactics as they did last year and
the same old leaders are at the head
of the agitation.
According to the etory of some of
the leaders it is proposed to make a
demand for the lessening of the hours
and the increase of wages n
April 1.
The leaders are not making much
progress in the way of securing mem
bers for the I. W. W. organization.
and the sentiment among the miners
as a whole is that the idleness thrust
upon them last year by the eame
(CBtlau4 Pag Tw)
day. less Inconsistency between "ourj
democratic purposes in this warj
abroad and the conduct of some of)
those guiding Industry at home, and j
the recognition of some form of col-
lectlve relationship between capital
and labor as a principle in a national;
labor policy, are the principal reoom-i
mendations of President Wilson's me-j
diation commission which just has fin-:
ished a survey of the labor unrest ,
west of the Mississippi river, which
the government considered most;
menacing to succeisful prosecution of i
the war." ;
In return for this, the commission;
holds, labor should "surrender all.
practices which tend to restrict max-'
imum efficiency" when it is assured
of sound conditions and effective
means for just redress of grievances.'
The commission, headed by Secre
tary Wilson of the department of la-'
bor. went west principally to look into
the copper strikes in the Arizona dis
trict and the I. W. W. activities in the
lumber districts of the Pacific north-i
west. It included in its investigation '
however, the dispute in the California'
oil fields, the threatened strike of Pa
cific coast telephone operators, the
threatened strike of packing house!
workers in Chicaeo, and the street"
railway trouble in Minneapolis andj
St Paul.
Generally, the commission found i
that uncorrected specific evils and the
absense of a healthy spirit between!
capital and labor, due partly to the1
evils mentioned and partly to "an I
unsound Industrial structure.' were;
the main causes of the industrial dif-!
ficulties arising since the war began.!
The commiaaion says that while sin-l
ister influences and extremist doc-;
trine" have availed themselves of'
these conditions, they have not ere-;
ated them. j
"The overwhelming mass of the la-!
boring population is in no sense dis-'
loyal." says the report. j
A means of correction suugested byj
the causes of the unrest itself the:
commission outlines as follows: i
"1. The elimination to the utmost'
practical extent of all profiteering dur
ing the period of the war is a pre-!
requisite to the best morale in indus-:
try. j
"2. Modern large-scale industry
has effectually destroyed the personal :
relation between employer and em-;
ployee the knowledge and co-opera-j
tion that come from personal contact
It is, therefore, no longer possible to;
conduct industry with employees as;
individuals. Some form of collective'
relationship between management and .
men is indispensable. The recogni-j
tion of this principle by the govern-,
meat should form an accepted part!
of the labor policy, of the nation. i
"3. Law, in business as elsewhere,
depends for its vitality upon steady;
enforcement Instead of waiting for;
adjustment after grievances come to
the surface, there is needed the es-j
tablishment of continuous administra
tive, machinery for the disposition of
Industrial Issues and the avoidance :
of an atmosphere of contention and'
the waste of disturbances. ;
"4. The eight hour day Is an e-
tablished policy of the country; expert-,
ence has proved justification of the
principle also in war times. Provision;
must of course be made for longer
hours in case of emergencies. Labor
will readily meet this requirement if:
its misuse is guarded against by ap-l
propriate overtime payments.
"6. Unified direction of the labor
administration of the United Stalest
for the period of the war should be I
established. At present there is an
unrelated number of separate com-;
mtttees, boards, agencies and depart-1
ments havin fragmentary and con-'
flirting jurisdiction over the labor'
problems raised by the war. A single-'
beaded administration is needed, with
full power to determine and establish
the necessary administrative struc
"6. When assured of sound labo
conditions and effective means for the
just redress of grievances that may

"7. Uncorrected evils are thej
greatest provocative extremist props- i
ganda, and their correction in itself
would be the best counter-propaganda.
But there is need for more affirma
tive education. There has been too
little publicity of an educative sort in
regard to labor's relations to the war.
The purposes of the government and
the methods by which it is purusmt
them should be brought home to thej

has most at stake in this war. and it
will eagerly devote its all if only It
be treated with confidence and un-j
fuller understanding of labor. Labor;
gene nor neglect, but dealt with as'
a part of the citizenship of the state.
At length the commission records
its search for tha "real cause" of the
labor unrest and comes to these con
clusions: "The conclusion cannot be escaped
that the available man power of the
nation, serving as the industrial arm
of war. is not employed to its full
capacity nor wisely directed to the
energies of w ar.
"The effective conduct of the war
suffers needlessly because of Interrup
tion of work due to actual or threat
ened strikes, purposed decrease in ef
ficiency through the strike on the
job. decrease in efficiency due to labor
unrest, and dislocation of the labor
Bupply.
"These are net new condition in
American Industry, nor are their
causes new. The conditions and their
causes have long been familiar and
long corrected. War has only served
to intensity the old derangements by
making greater demands upon indus
try and by affording new disturbing
factors.
"Among the causes of unrest, fa
miliar to students of industry the fol
lowing stand out with s;ccUl signifi
cance to the industrial needs of
war:
"Broadly speaking. American fndus
try larks a healthy basis of relation
ship between management and men.
At bottom this is due to the insistence
by employers upon individual dealings
with their men. Direct dealings with
employees' organization is still the
minority rule in the United States.
In the majority of instances there is
no joint dealing, and in too many
instances employers are In active op
position to labor organizations. This
failure to equalize the parties in ad
justments of inevitable industrial con
tests is the central cause of our diffi
culties. There is a comraendab.'e
spirit throughout the country to cor-re-t,
specific evils. The leaders In in
dustry must go further: they must
help to correct the state of mind on
the part of labor: they must aim for
the release of normal feelings by en
abling labor to take its place as a
co-operator in the industrial enter
prise. In a word, a conscious attempt
must be made to generate a new
spirit of industry.
"Too many labor disturbances are
due to the absence cf disinterested
processes to which resort may be had
for peaceful settlement. Force be
comes to ready an outlet. We need
continuous administrative machinery
by which grievances inevitable itj In
dustry may be easily and quickly dis
posed of nd not allowed to reach tbe
pressure of explosion.
"There is a widespread lack of
knowledge on the part of capital a
to labor's feelings and needs. anJ on
the part of labor as to problems of
management This is due primarily
to a lafk of collective) negotiation
as the normal process of industry.
In addition there is but little realiza
tion on the part of industry that the
so-called labor problem demands not
only occasional attention but contin
uous snd systematic responsibility, as
much so as the technical or financial
aspects of industry.
"Certain specific grievances, when
long uncorrected, not only mean defi
nite hardships; they serve ss symbols
of the attitude of employers and thus
affect the underlying irit Hours and
wages are. of coursex mostly in issue.
On the whole, wage increases are
asked for mostly in order to meet the
increased cost of living, and such de
mands should be met in the lisht of
their economical causes. Again, the
demand for the eight-hour day is na
tion wide, for the workers regard It
as expressive of an accepted national
policy.
"Repressive dealing with manifes
tations of labor unrest is the source
of much bitterness, turns radical load
ers into martyrs and thus increases
their folio ius", and. worst of all. .in
the minds of workers tends to impli
cate the government as a partisan in
an economic conflict. The problem
is a delicate one. There is no doubt,
however, that the Bisbee and Jerome
deportations, the Everett incident, the
Little hanging, and similar acts of
violence against workers have had a
very harmful effect upon labor both in
the United States and in some of the
allied countries. Such incidents are
attempts to deal with symptoms rath
er than causes. The I. W. W. has ex
ercised its strongest hold in those in
dustries and communities where em
ployers have most resisted the trade
union movement and where some
form of protest against unjust treat
ment was inevitable.
The derangement of our labor sup
ply ts one of the great evils in indus
try. The shockingly large amount of
labor turnover and the phenomenon
of migratory labor means an enor
mous economic waste and involves an
even greater social cost These ara
evils which flow from grievances such
as those we have set forth: they are
accentuated by uncontrolled instabil
ity of employment. Finally, we haw

I know that to thousands of men in

blacked our shoes. In a semi-conscious
manner, cot fully realizing our bless

comforts, we have become a tribe of
nomads, wandering aimlessly around
in search of something that has been
ruthlessly taken from our leisure

J. D Tush, salesman for the Quality
Tailors and a popular "Y" lobbyist,
returned Friday with one of the little
angels from the Angel City, whose
name hereafter will be Mrs. Bush.
This is supposed to be a great sur

that a little "angel" told thera all
about it. Mr. Bush will be at his old

On Saturday niht the lird. the
original Stroller's quartet will make
their appearance in the gymnasium,
this being one of the Lyceum and
Entertainment course put on by tbe
association. This company was or
ganized in 1906. and made its first ap
pearance in towns and cities on tbe
Pacific coast. Since that time, and
with only one change in the person
nel during all the years of their or
ganization, the company has rilled ea
gagements in nearly ery state of
the union. These men are not only
of first-class ability as singers and en
tertainers, but they have a higti
standard of what a lyceum program
should be, and they work constantly
tn adding to their program new ma
terial and in giving it an artistic fin
ish that was made The Strollers a
standard of excellence. People often
ask of a quartet: Is it as good as
The Strollers?" Rose Crane, formerly
president of the International Lyceum
association wrote the Century Bureau:
'The Strollers unquestionably are one
of the leading quartets on the plat
form, both as a singing organization
and in their specialty and entertain
ing features." Members of the Y and
their families are invited the enter
