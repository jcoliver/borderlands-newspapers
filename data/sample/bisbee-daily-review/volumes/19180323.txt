Check Artist
Under Arrest
Karl Larkan, who is believed, to be
a smooth check artist and who's ar
rest mry lead to Important govern
ment investigations, was arrested in
Clifton last evening o:i the reiuest of
the sheriff's o'fice here on a warrant
sworn out charging him with passing
a begus check. On Thursday night he
approached T. B. Caldwell, a local
auto owner, and wanted to hire a car
to take him to Clifton . He asked the
price and was told that it would be
$1CMI. He off-red a check for that
amount but Caldwell did not want to
lake the check and Larkan offered to
call up the manager of the Metcalf
6tore near Clifton to vouch for the
check which was on the Bank of
Italy at San Francisco. They couM
not catch th-; manager so Caldwell
took the check. Yesterday morning
he wired the tank in San Francisco
regarding the check and they wired
back that he had no account. A war
rant was then sworn out for his ar
rest and the sheriff's o'fie? here noti
fied the Clifton oficers and he was
placed in jail and will be held until
an officer can go after him.
It is believed that he is an im
personator. H3 was traveling around
here dressed as a sailor and was dis
playing pictures of himself taken in
the uniform and also one taken with

where he stated that he could secure

It is the opinion of some that he is
endeavoring to get through the c'oun

or so in each place and issuing these

GRAIN MARKET
CHICAGO, March 22. Action of the
I"rr'?el Srates senate in favor or a
her guarantee price for the 191
wheat crop had a bullish effect today
on the value of coarse graia. Chiefly
as a result, corn finished steady ?t Vi
to ri cent net advance with March
S1.277J, snd May $126'. Oats gained
3i to "i cent. In provisions the out
rrno varied from unchanged figure!
ta def ?!ii of 22 cents.
Trades were not slow to act on the
theory that if wheat was worth 30
cents" a bushel mare, other cereals
should commend a notable increase.
Aside from legislative changes, more
cvrr. it was pointed out that the
rt'ovement nf the cprn crop had seri
ously diminished and that primary re
ceipts tMav were nearly 900,000
bustels less than on the corr-spsnd
ing dny lit v eek whereas. North
American clearances for the week had
mre than doubled.
OSts as well a corn responded

hogs weakened provisions.

I The German Offensive
Long heralded and overdue, the German
offensive seems to have begun in the west.
Over a fifty-mile front it extends, center
ing it intensity the first day upon sixteen
miles of the Cambrai sector. Some ad
vanced positions have been taken and out
posts driven back, but no real success
achieved or points captured that threaten
the allied battle line. .The first thirty hours
of an offensive have generally determined
its success. It is true that the Verdun and
Somme offensive lasted for months and re
sulted in material gains, even after the first
week, especially the latter. But the British
are better prepared and have more men and
guns on this sector than the French had at
Verdun, and the Germans lack the muni
tions available for the British operations
upon the Somme.
Then again, as Marshal Soult told Napol
eon at Waterloo, "The English infantry,
sire, are very hard to break." Ah, there s
the rub for the Prussian. The British in
fantry ARE hard to break. Napoleon lost
at Waterloo because these British troops
would not break when, by every law of war
and reason, they should have broken be
cause of their losses and the f irey valor that
pressed upon them.
At the first battle of Yres in the Ger
man drive upon the channel ports, the Eng
lish infantry, outnumbered , out-gunned,
and gassed, did not break. It is not likely
they will do so at Cambrai.
If this offensive is continued iupon a
mighty scale it will surely shorten the war.
To the allied military chiefs it is too good
to be true. It was feared that the Prussian
would keep on the defensive. If he has de
cided to stake all upon one colossal conflict,
so much the better for the allies. They are
ready and anxious for the test. Their
morale is higher than at any time during the
war. Trained to the minute; fully equip
ped; with a numerous artillery, and a re
serve army prepared for this very emerg
ency and ready to be moved quickly to any
point of the line, this offensive would seem ,
to be playing right into the allied hands in
this war of attrition.
American troops cannot possibly be
ready in sufficient numbers to take any
prominent part in the war this year. But
they will be ready next year, more than a
million of them; probably nearer two mil
lion. And when the German waves roll
back finally from this attack, thinned and
broken, they will never advance again. The
allies can turn, after the appalling losses
of the gigantic battle, to America for re
serves. Germany will have no reserves
for next year. -Then the last fight will take
place on the Rhine.
Of course, the war may well be decided
in this present conflict, but it is not proba
ble. It still seems incredible that this of
fensive is anything more than a great
feint ; a blind, to hide the real motives of the
sorely pressed German staff. If this of
fensive is stopped without material gains
it will lower the morale of German troops
just that much. If it is pressed relentlessly
it will lower German numbers just that
much. But that it will succeed in any
measure is impossible unless something
terrible and unforscen should occur. All
things are possible in pitched battle, but
the British infantry have outfought the Ger
mans too often and too long in thi3 war to
break before them now.
To sum up the present situation, it can
safely be said that it is yet too soon to con
sider this as the grand offensive of the war,
but if it should prove so to be, well and
good, for the allies were prepared for' it at
the very point of attack; prepared fur it in
men, batteries, munitions and courage, and
they will surely stop it and themselves take
the offensive, and as a result of the German
losses, which will be past all counting, end
the war the sooner by many a long and
weary and costlj- and blocd- men

Not Only War Work for
Women, but Husbands!
Gracious heavens! Here are startling,
strange and conflicting statements regard
ing social conditions in Cochise county, set
forth in the Douglas International. The re
porter interviewed a Douglas merchant up
on the subject of the scarcity of young
women, and especially school teachers, in
the county, and the man said : '
"I think the chamber of commerce ought
to take this thing up and bring in a trainload
of nice girls from New England. There is
not only work - for them here, but hus
bands. I feel sure that the whole trainload
could be married off here in two months. '
Then the reporter hunted up an old
maid they have them in Douglas, it seems
and she deposed and said : "There are so
few nice men here, and many of them are
so mean."
There you are! Straight from the shoul
der; an awful blow. "So few nice; men'
in Douglas. That is too bad. And this
Douglas merchant. He wants a trainload
of girls shipped to the county. A trainload,
mind you, not a carload. This merchant
would convey the impression to the re3t of
the country that Cochise county, Arizona,
is in about the same state as Jamestown,
Virginia, in the old colonial days when they
sent a shipload of maids from England to
be wooed in the courting meadow, and mar
ried forthwith to each man who had enough
tobacco to pay their passage over.
As to the maidless condition of Doug
las, this editor cannot say with certainty,
having spent but little time there during his
few visits to the Smelter City, but there are
plenty of maids in the Warren district.
These New England lassies, unless they are
hand picked and the cream of the section,
rray well have close competition in the mat
ter of bridal veils and wedding bells. And
the chamber of commerce that imports
them may, unlike the Virginia company of
the old day3, have a lot of young women
!ef t over on its hands. Better cut that train
oad down to a car.
It is with much satisfaction that The Re
view comments upon the fact that the coun
ty and state authorities have gotten togeth
er upon the Cochise county road work.
Whatever the cause of the controversy, or
whoever was to blame, the results were the
same to the county they did harm. Good
judgment,' good sense and patient effort
have succeeded' in bridging a chasm' that
was pretty wide at first. Peremptory and
apparently unwarranted action Upon the
part cf the state in assuming control of
county road work marked the beginning of.
the trouble. This was met with resolute in
dependence upon the -part of the county
supervisors. Neither the mails, the tele
graph or the telephone could serve to reach
an understanding. But when the county
and state officials got together around the
council table the affair was soon straight
ened out. The Cochise county road work
continues under the supervision of the same
competent foreman of the old bootlegger
camp on the Tombstone-Bisbee highway
and the state pays its portion of expense.
The spirit that brought about this agree
ment of resumption of road work is to be
commended. Personal differences were
buried beneath the need of the public for
good roads. This is as it should be and re
sults in a happy outcome of what promised
to be a long and disagreeable controversy.
At last that report of Secretary Wilson's
labor commission has been boldly branded
as bogus and merely a substitute for a re
port of true conditions that.led up to and
finally caused the famous Bisbee deporta
tion. And no less personage than a U. S.
senator applied the brand, selected the hall
of the senate as his stage. And the nation
heard him. And other senators joined the
brave Senator King of Utah in the demand
that the government stop "coddling the I.
W. W." Some day the real facts and under
lying principles of that Wilson commis
-sion's report on the deportation will come
to light, and be published to the world,
along with the real facts and underlying
causes of that deportation. And Bisbse
will not only be justified by the reat of the
country, but she will be applauded. Wonccr
how Congressman Carl Hayden felt when
he read Senator King's denunciation?

said, "have we made this old' world so beau

Style Headquarters
To make good stylish clothes, requires
master hands.
In the making of Society Brand Clothes,
master designers, master cutters and master
tailors are employed men who hive been
developed according to the Society Brand
way.
There is but one standard in these shops.
The master-designer tailor and the force
of specially trained workmen under him
know, by practice, one method, one system.
A garment of the lowest priced line is tailor
ed by the same method as a garment of the
highest price. There is no compromise with
,h:fts. The difference in price is the
a fabrics and trimmings.
