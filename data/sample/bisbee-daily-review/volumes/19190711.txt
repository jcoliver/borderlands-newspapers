The delegation of the returned service
men who are attending the state conven

left last evening in a special car on th
10:40 train for Tucson.
A larre number of friends were at the
station to see them off and at Osborne
, they will be joined by the delegations
from Douglas, Tombstone and other parts
of Cochise county all bent on the election
of their candidate. Sergt. Andy Martin
of Tucson, as the next president of the
state organization of the American Le

and with the Ideas secured there, the lor
A men feel that it will be a matter of
a very few days until a Bislee post of
the American Legion will be organized.
A large number of men who are Interest
ed in the formation of a local post would
have attended the convention but) busi
ness interfered -.and they will derive the
lenefit of the .convention from hearing
what the delegates have to say on their
return.
Among those who left by train and
automobile are: J. L. Schmalzel, C. H.

Much enthusiasm was prevalent among
the delegates last evening, all bore the
delegate badges Inscrllied "Delegate. Co

county are bent on securing the next
meeting of the legion for some city In Co
chise county. If they succeed In this plan
It will mean much to Cochise, in general
and Bisbee or Douglas particularly. As
the convention Is attended by thousands
and the advertising: that the county will
receive would be worth thousands of dol

PEACE TR EATY
EXPLAINED BY
To Oppose Any
Change by Senate
Senate Divided in Bitter Fight
Received Wilson With Loud
Cheers; ' Listened to His
Words in Grave Silence; U.
S. Isolation Gone 20 Years
Ago Says President Wilson
WASHINGTON, July 10. The
peace treaty "with Its League of Na
tions covenant was laid before the Ben
ate by. President Wilson. today In an
address, accounting to the country for
his part in the negotiations at Ver
sailles. '
League Born of Conviction"
The league, declared the 'president,
was born of the conviction of practi
cal statesmen that an international
concert had .become a world necessity
to end the old order and guarantee
civilization. He asserted that in such
a concert the world looked confidently
to America for leadership, and added
that while the treaty might not be ex
actly as the American delegation
would have written it, no vital prin
ciple bad been sacrificed by the neces
sary comprises.
Senate Listen in Silence
The senate, already divided in a bit
ter fight over the league proposal, re
ceived the president with cheers and
listened to his words In a grave si
lence. When he had concluded there
was another burst of cheering until
he had passed out of the chamber and
gone to his capitol office, where he
talked for an hour with senators who
wished to ask about specific features
of the treaty.br the negotiations. In
these conferences, the president dis
cussed freely such subjects as the dis
position of Shantung, the German in
demnities and Irish freedom.
Does Not Answer Questiont Involved
In his address, however, there was
no direct reference to many or tne
questions around which senate debate
has centered, the president declaring
he could not construe details of the
treaty in a short address. He did not
directly mention the Monroe doctrine,
Shantung or the obligations assumed
under article ten of the league cove
nant, nor did be allude to the pro
posal to write reservations into the
ratification. He asserted a hope that
he would be given opportunity to dis
cuss details later, either with the
whole senate or the foreign relations
committee.
All Information Offered
"II y services and all the Information
I possess," said Mr. Wilson, "will be at
your disposal and at the disposal of
your committee on foreign relations at
any time, either informally or in ses
sion, a9 you prefer; and I hope that
you will not hesitate to make use of
them."
U. 8. Isolation Ended
American isolation, the president
asserted, was ended twenty years ago
when the war with Spain put the na
tion in partial control of Cuba and the
Philippines.
Have Not Exploited Them
"But we have not exploited them,"
he continued. "We have, been their
friends and have sought to serve them
there can be no question
of our ceasing to be a world power.
The only question is whether we can
refuse the moral leadership that Is
offered us;, whether we shall ac
cept or reject the confidence of
the woEld. , . . . .
No Turning Back, Forward Always
"The stage is set, the destiny dis
closed. It has come about by no plan
of our conceiving, but by the hand of
God, who has led us into this way. We
cannot turn back. We can only go for
ward, with lifted eyes and freshened
spirit, to follow the "vision."
League a Practical Necessity
Alluding to the skepticism with
which the plan for a League of Na
tions was received, the president said
that as the peace negotiations pro
ceeded It became apparent to all the
delegates that such a concert was "a
practical necessity," demanded by "all
the peoples of the world." For the
United States to reject it, he asserted,
"would break the heart of the world."
Pointing out that many minor compro
mises were made to secure the support
of all the Interested nations, he con
tinued: Treaty Bast That Could Be Expected
"The treaty as a"result, is not ex
actly what we would'have written. It
is probably not what any one of the
national delegates would have writ
ten. 'But results were worked out,
which on the whole, bear the test. I
think, .that it will be found that the
compromises which were accepted as
Inevitable, nowhere cut to the heart of
any principle."
"In the settlement of the peace,"
the president said, "we. have sought no
special reparation for ourselves, but
only the restore ton of-right and the
atsur mce of liberty everywhere that

Cochise County
Hospital, Arrested
Strikes and Abuses Night Nurse
Is Charge; Released Under
$1,000 Bail .,
Dr. P. Vf. Randan, one of the oldest
physicians in the county and at pres
ent superintendent of the county hos
pital at Douglas, was placed under
arrest yesterday by Deputy Sheriff A.
E. Palmer on the complaint of Mrs.
A. McRae, who is one of the nurses
employed there.
Dr. Randall was later released un
der $1000 bonds from the felony
charge of assault by M. P. Donahue,
justice of the peace, and the prelimi
nary hearing was Bet for today.
Mrs. McRae tells the story that the
doctor came into the hospital slightly
out of his head and began to raise a
disturbance about 1 o'clock Wednes
day morning, and in trying to get him
quiet the doctor struck her and used
abusive language.
Mrs. McRae insisted that he should
be punished, aa he would do the same
thing over again if some action was
not taken, Intimating that his political
influence was such that she could not
get redress in no other way.
the effects of the settlements were to
be felt, we entered the war as the dis
interested champions of rie-ht and v
interested ourselves, in the terms of
the peace hitio other capacity.
"The hopes of the nations allied
against the central powers were at a
low ebb when our soldiers began to
pour across the sea."
The president then pictured graphi
cally the part the American soldiers
V - . ....
uaa in turning me tiae against the
Boche and continued:
"They were terrible in battle and
gentle and helpful .out of it, remem
bering the mothers and sisters, the
wives and the little children at home.
They were free men under arms, not
forgetting their ideals of duty in the
midst of tasks of violence. I am proud
to have had the privilege of being as
sociated with them and of calling my
self their leader.
"But I speak now of what they
meant to the men by whose sides
they fought and, to the people with
whom they mingled with such utter
simplicity as friends who asked only
to be of service. They were for all
the visible embodiment of America
"And the compulsion of what they
stood for was upon us who represent
ed America at the peace table. It
was our duty to see to it that every
decision -we took part in contributed,
so far as we were able to infuence
it, to auiet the fears and rpniio tho
hopes of the peoples who had been
. living in that shadow, the nations that
jhad come , by our assistance to their
: freedom. It was our duty to do every
thing that it was within our power
to make the triumph of freedom and
. of right.
' "That meant that liew Tint inn a d-om
to be created Poland, Czecho-Slo-vakia,
Hungary itself. No part or
ancient Poland had ever in any Jrue
sense been a part of Germany or of
Russia or of Austria."
Regarding the proposed reservation
under which the senate would declare
the nation could not enter war under
article ten without a war declaration
by congress, Mr. Wilson was reported
to have declared such a. stipulation
unnecessary. He was quoted as say
ing that the constitutional inability of
the United StateB to make war with
out a congressional declaration was
one of the reasons why the league
council was authorized only to "ad
vise" as to the steps to be taken.
In all the president's visit to the
capitol occupied less than two hours
Arriving shortly after noon, he went
to his office adjoining the senate
chamber arid at 12:15 was escorted to
the vice president's desk by the five
senior members of the foreign rela
tions committee. The applause follow
ing his appearance had continued for
two minutes when Vice President Mar
shall rapped for order and the presi
dent began speaking.
The address required 39 minutes
and at its conclusion, while the sen
ate and galleries stood and applauded,
he mas escorted from the chamber by
the specially designated foreign rela
tions members. He left for the White
House at 1:45 p. m.
Mrs. Wilson and the president's
daughter, Miss Margaret Wilson, were
in the gallery during the address. The
French ambassador, Jules J. Jusser
and dean of the diplomatic corps, had
the unusual privilege of a seat In the
president's reserved section, and many
other foreign diplomats were in the
diplomatic gallery.
After the president finished speak
ing the senate adjourned until Monday
when the ratification debate will be
gin. The foreign relations committee
also will meet Monday to begin con
sideration of the treaty.
Reads Manuscript
Speaking from the same platform
where eighteen months ago, he as
tounded the world with his first dec
laration for a League of Nations, the
president read his address slowly and
in i a ' clear, quiet voice. His manu
script, typewritten on small "pages, he

with an occasional gesture. Before

National Figures Make Short
Addresses to Crowd; Irish
Republic an Assured Success
Says Valera.
NEW YORK, July 10. An enor
mous crowd attended a meeting to
night in Madison Square Garden un
der the auspices of the Friends or
Irish Freedom at which Eamonn de
Valera, "president of the Irish repub
lic" was the chief speaker.
Twelve thousand men, women and
children forced their way Into the
garden before the doors were closed.
.When Mr. de Valera was intro
duced wild cheering burst forth? The
ovation lasted fully fifteen minutes.
The uporar was heard outside and
the cheering was taken up in the
streets.
It was Mr. de Valera's first public
address in this city. Supreme Court
Justice Daniel F. Cohalan presided.
With the Irish president walked for
mer governor Edward F. Dunn of Illi
nois, Frank P. Walsh of Kansas City,
and Michael J. Ryan of Philadelphia,
who recently returned from France
after having, on behalf of Irish AmerK
cans, attempted to obtain a hearing
at the peace conference for. delegates
representing "the Irish repubilc."
Justice Cohalan said the purpose ot
the meeting was threefold: to pay
honor to the president of the "Irish
republic," to welcome home the "Irish
American commissioners," and to pro
test against the League ot
Nations, "which is only an attempt to
foist on the world what is nothing
more than an Angelo-American alli
ance." Bedlam broke loose when Mr. de
Valera, flanked by standard bearers
carrying the flags of United States
and "Irish republic," advanced to the
front of the platform to speak. Cries
of "De Valera! De Valera!" thunder
ed across the auditorium.
"That is New York's recognition of
the Irish republic," said Mr. de Val
era. "The fathers of the Irish republic
were Orangemen, or rather were Pto
testants," continued the speaker. "I
have not forgotten that the idea or
this republic was founded in the north
and I am certain that if England's
interferring hand were taken away,
the appearance of division would dis
appear. And when I mention Bel
fast, it will be news, to New York, to;
tell you that in that city there are
more Irish nationalists than in Cork.
"Irishmen want their country. It
is rightfully and lawfully (heirs.
"Irishmen want their freedom; free
dom to live their own lives in their
own way, freedom to develop along
their own lines, freedom to express
their own national individuality in
government, trade, art and literature,
freedom to raise their own institu
tions in accord with their own genius,
freedom to come out once more into'
the big world to share in its activities,
to act and be acted upon and to con
tribute their quota to human achieve
ment "And not least, freedom from the
infamous libel spread by the organ
ized official propaganda of the' En
glish government in order to hide the
true nature of their rule in Ireland,
throw dust in the eyes of the people
and cover up the truth."

British Military
Is In Control Of
Tipperary County
DUBLIN, July 10. (By the Asso
ciated Press.) County Tipperary and
the rest of Ireland have received
quietly the proclamation of the gov
ernment Monday declaring all Sinn
Fein organizations and Irish volun
teers In County Tipperary unlawful
associations. The proclamation places
all local activities in Tipperary under
control of the military and prevents
all persons from entering t,he district
without a permit, thus restricting
business.
It was expected in Tipperary, after
the murder of a police inspector at
Thurles, that the government would
pursue the same policy it adopted
after the murders in County Clare and
elsewhere, The crimes act proclama
tion is a reversion to the methods em
ployed against the National League in
Parnell's time.
Under the terms of the proclamation
membership in the various prohibited
organizations becomes a criminal of
fense and meetings of those bodies
becomes illegal.
Resolutions were adopted denounc
ing the League o Nations as 'a device
to stifle the conscience of Christen
dom by prohibiting any nation from
taking action to end atrocities perpe
trated on people held in subjection
against their will by an alien govern
ment," and protesting against the
league as "a scheme to fasten upon
the United States the abhorrent task
of maintaining the integrity of far
flung possessions of the great empires
of the world," and demanding formal
recognition of the Irish republic," by
the United States. :

EISEL FORD
IN LIBEL CASE
MOUNT CLEM ENS, Mich., July 10.
Edsel B. Ford, 25 years old, president
of the largest automobile company In
the world, son of Henry Ford, who,
having been characterized as an anar
chist by the' Chicago Daily Tribune, is
suing for $1,000,000 damages on a
charge of libel, appeared as a witness
in Judge Tucker's court today.
Other witnesses were CoT. R. R. Mc
Cormick, president of the Tribune com
pany, and Ernest G. Liebold, general
secretary to Henry Ford.
Mr. Ford's testimony dealt mainly
with a financial statement of the Ford
Motor company, which was put into
the record over objections of counsel
for the plaintiff to show, Attorney El
liott G. Stevenson, for the Tribune,
said, that the "profit sharing" plan
inaugurated by the company in 1914
"was mere humbug." Attorney Stev
enson in examining the witness said:
"You have been in Detroit continu
ously since 1916, except as business
called you away, or pleasure?" he
asked.
"Yes."
"You are not a member of the Na
tional Guard?"
"No, sir.
uNor any other military organiza
tion?" "No. sir."
A financial statement of the earn
ings of the company in 1914 was iden
tified by the witness. His testimony
showed that in 1903, the Ford com
pany started with $50,000 in cash, and
Mr. Ford's model of a cheap automo
bile. A $150,000 corporation was
founded, Mr. Ford holding 51 per cent
of the stock. In .1914 the financial
statement showed the net profits were
$30,338,454.
Attorney Alfred Lucking, of counsel
for Ford, objected to discussion of the
financial statement as irrelevant, and
Mr. Stevenson repliea
"They have been making a great
deal of their so-called educational or
sociological program, and the division
of profits. My purpose is to show that
on $50,000, the actual capital invested,
the company earned $30,000,000 in
1914, and that, therefore, to call what
they :ive employes profit sharing is
mere humbug."
Mr. Lucking entered another objec
tion, stating that plaintiff was willing
to admit prosperity.
"Opposing counsel has satd tnat
there were plenty of profits. Well,
what of itr said Mr. Lucking.
"The profit sharing plan of 1914
practically doubled the Incomes of em

The judges called off all pool betting

WASIIINGTOX, July 10. Because
of its bearing on the fate of wartime
prohibition. President Wilson's view
tbat completion of demobilization of
the army would depend upon the speed
with which Germany executes the mil
itary terms of tne treaty and with
which the pact was ratified by the
various nations, was widely discussed
today in congressional and other
circles.
Prohibition advocates expressed the
opinion that demobilization probably
would not be completed before the
country became dry by constitutional
amendment next January 16.
Those, favoring the repeal of war
time prohibition insofar as it affects
light wines and beer had not given up
hope, however,, as they believed de
mobilization might be ; declared corn
pleted 'when the army.; had psen' rew

SHE SUFFERED
SINCE S
MRS. O'NEILL GAINS EIGHTEEN
POUNDS ON TANLAC AND
TROUBLES ARE OVERCOME
"I have just finished my third bottle
of Tanlac and have .actually Rained IS
pounds." was the remarkable statement
made by Mrs. MamuS' O'Neill of 2G01i,i
Wclton street, Denver, Colo., recently.
"Ever since I was a child." Mrs. O'Neill
continued, "even as far back as I can
remember, I have had trouble with my
stomach. Everything I would eat soured
on my stomach causing- awful pain and
at times I would almost smother from
the gas which would rise up around my
heart. My trouble lecame worse as I
grew older and finally I got to where
I dreaded to eat anything on account
of the dreadful suffering it caused me.
"I tried every kind of medicine, I think,
that-is. made for stomach trouble, both in
tablet and liquid' fo;m, ;but nothing ever
did me any good. - I fell e.ff J:n weigh t.
was very weakand when night came I
was so tired I could hardly move. My
brother in Pueblo told me of the fine re
sults he had gotten from Tanlac and ad
vised me to try It. The 'result is, I'm
just beginning to enjoy, the .blessings of
good health. 'I 'can't reinenUer when I
was in as, good physical condition as now
and it's 'the first time -$ince I was 'a
child that I could eat without suffering
afterwards. My' appetite ts splendid and
I can eat just anything I want and 'en
joy it, and I know ii my food did not
agroe with' me I could never have gained
so much in weight. I sleep well every
night now and Tanlac has built up my
strength until I can do my work with
out getting the least ' bit tired. I- now
recommend Tanlac to everylody, because
of what it has done for me and I'm buy
ing a bottle now for a friend of mine for
I believe it is just what she needs.",

REVIVING THE DEPORTATION CASES j
SEVERAL hundred Bisbee and Douglas citizens
are being arrested on information filed by the
county attorney of Cochise county charged with
engaging in the deportation of July 12, 1917, at Bis
bee. Without expressing any opinion as to the mer
its of .these cases, we think the great majority of
citizens of the state, regardless of their views as to
the' wisdom of the course of the Bisbee men in par
ticipating in the deportations, will regret the revival
of these elmrgcs.
It is probably true that some not members of the
I. W. W. were included among those deported. These
have sought their proper remedy in the civil courts.
Already those against whom the actions were brought
have offered what appears to be reasonable settle
ments and those who have complained have been
advised by their counsel to accept.
It is of course very doubtful whether convictions
can be secured. It is always difficult to secure con
victions when the trial is postponed unt.il a time long
after the commission of the offense. The course the
cases will probably take will be a waiver of prelimi
nary examination and the holding of the defendants
to the superior court. One or two cases may be tried,
prominent defendants being selected by the county

result in acquittal, the rest will probably be dropped.
We are not familiar with the law of deportation.
In any event the revival of the criminal charges is
to be regretted. It will do no good. The set of cir
cumstances under which the deportations were made
will never occur again. Those aggrieved can seek
redress in civil actions, which ahead'' have been
filed. (Tucson Citizen.)

FATE
IN 1917 two rival Republican organizations fought for control o;
the city of Philadelphia. The fifth ward -was a hotbed of strife.
There the McNichol-Penrose leader was Carey and the Vare
leader, Ike Deutsch.
A few days before the primary election the Deutsch gang im
ported gunmen from New York and there was shooting, blackjacking
and violence such as shocked not only the city and the state but the
nation.
In an attack upon the Carey headquarters Eppley, a policeman,
was mortally wounded.
Various of the gunmen are now in prison. Deutsch was tried
and convicted but the verdict was overturned.
The other day Deutsch was sitting in front of his home in the
fifth ward with his wife and child by his side. A dog, a pet of, his
child, was attracted by something and started to run off. The child
cried in alarm and Deutsch arose and went in pursuit of the dog.
He had gone but a short distance whe t he gasped, put his hand
to his heart and sank to the pavement. An ambulance was summon--ed
and he was taken to a hospital where he died without recovering
consciousness.
Then it was discovered that:
The ambulance was the same one in which Kppley was taken to
the hospital, was drive-i by the same person and the same interne
sat on the seat in the rear.
Also that Deutsch by chance was placed on the same bed in the
hospital in which Kppley died and was attenden by the same nurse
and the same surgeon.
And that, so far as can be calculated, there was practically no
variation in the time between the wounding of Eppley and his death
and the collapse of Deutsch and the ending of his life.
COPPER TO THE FORE
COPPER having reached a juice of 19 3-4 cents Tuesday, it is
only a question of a day or two until the red metal will be
back in the 20 s. This means that smaller properties will be
constantly resuming production during the next few months
and that the larger low grade companies, which have been running at
a loss, can now make copper at a profit.
Arizona being the first copper state in the union, the advance
in the market for the red metal means much to this commonwealth.
Since the peace treaty was sighed, the copper market is showing pro
nounced strength and the persistent advance of copper securities re
flects the growing confidence of the producers themselves and the
financial interests in a growing demand for copier, both in domestic
markets and for foreign consumption. This insures great prosperity
in all of the copper districts. Pisbeo, Douglas, Globe, Jerome, Ajo,
hay and Clifton will benefit especially, but cities like Tucson and
Phoenix and Prescott quickly reflect the prosperity i;i the copper
producing section and thnre are many districts tributary to the Old
Pueblo.
Prosperous times are ahead for all Arizona. Copper and silver
both offer tempting opportunities for investors and many new prop
erties, are bound t bo opened up during the coining year. Tucson

Rod plots to overthrow the government at Washington will be

PHOENIX, July 10. Appointments
for the reorganization of the Btate
dental board were announced yester
day by Governor Thomas E. Camp
bell as follows:
Dr. R. J. Roper of Prescott, vice Dr.
J. H. Blain of that city, for the term
ending January 1, 1921. Dr. E. A.
Miller of Flagstaff, succeeding Dr. J.

fill an unexpired vacancy ending Jan
uary 1, 1923, and Dr. W. A. Baker, a
member of the present board, retains

1S24.
There was. much controversy over
the state in the matter of dental reg
ulations, and a bill was passed by
the last legislature making drastic
changes. The bill was vetoed, by the
governor for the reason that it appa
rently let down the bars to the en
trance of dentists not fully qualified.
NARROWLY ESCAPE I DROWNING
PIMA, Ariz., July JO. The Pima
Valley Farmer says: .
Mr. and Mrs. Walter Ferris, Lloyd,
Edith and Marion Wills, narrowly es
caped death when the Ford in which
they were riding dropped through a
bridge on the San Carlos reservation
about one mfle this side of Bayles.
The party, all of whom live on a
ranch southwest of Globe, were en
route to Safford to take in the Fourth
of July celebration. The recent heavy
rains are supposed to have undermin
ed the supports of the small wooden
bridge. The car crossed the bridge
to' a point of almost safety, the front
wheels reached the far end of the
bridge. The bridge, says Ferris,
simply fell from beneath them, the
car falling back-end first into the
wash. All parties were either partly
or completely hurled beneath the car.
Help arrived and they were dug out.
Mrs. Ferris was painfully injured
about the back and Lloyd Wills sus
tained, a badly bruised and sprained
wrist. Mrs. Ferris was taken to Fort
Thomas after receiving medical at
tention in Safford and other members
of the party were taken to that point
later in the day by Sheriff Dave
Skaggs.

NEW STRIKE AT SYLVANITE
CLIFTON, July 10 The Era is in
receipt of a letter from Sam Morrow,
well known in Clifton, written from
Globe, telling of a gold strike recent
ly made by him at. the old Sylvanite
in tho mwh ,fi-:, os i camp soutn. of Hachita. Gold was

tions to the city of Mesa, additional
construction totalling more than
$25,000 has been completed, and oth
er building which will reach almost
as large a sum is now being done.
Figures of the city engineer and
building inspector for the first six
months of the year are equal to any
other period in the history of the
city, if not larger. They reach, for
completed structures, the grand total
of $52,500.
Included in the buildings and resi
dences which have been completed,
since the first of the year, are some
of the most beautiful and. best which
have ever been built in this city or
valley. Most of the buildings and
residences, however, have been on the
modest but substantial kind, bespeak
ing the permanancy of the city's de
velopment and advancement, and the
stable business of the city's citizens.
The thing for the world to remember is that the hardest peace

RED HILLS BONDED
TO GLOBE CAPITAL
FLORENCE, July 10. C. E. Calk
ins, a mining engineer, was here the
latter part of last week from Globe,
and closed a deal for Globe and Miami
mining men for a bond on the Red
Hills mining property, owned by W. Y.
Price, C. G. Powell and G. F. Westfall.
The property includes nineteen claims
and it is understood we bond was for
$550,000. A bond was also taken on
two claims owned by G. F. Westfall
and Juan de Arinitt, these claims be
ing adjacent to the Red Hills proper
ty, and that the bond was tor $5,000.
Mr. Calkins spent several days here
and went over the property quite
thoroughly before taking the bond.
Under the terms of the bond, work
must begin within sixty days; how
ever, Mr. Calkins made the statement
that work would actually begin within
thirty days and that development
work will be pushed as rapidly as pos
sible. This property is located twelve
miles east of Florence and is a rich
deposit of copper ore. The property
has been bonded several times, but
the parties did not seem to have suf-
first discovered at Sylvanite by Mor
row and associates in 1907. Placer
gold and rich float was found in
many places but it was a mystery to
the prospectors where this had come
from. Morrow writes that on the 10th
day of May last he stumbled on the
real thing, a fonalite dyke, with ore
cropping that assays $268.80 per ton
in gold and $12.64 cents in silver.
LOCATES BRIDGE SITE
OVER COLORADO
KINGMAN, July 10 Lieut. T. J.
O'Connel, a man of ability, who saw
war service and is now on the state
engineer's force, is in cnarge of the
160-mile highway and bridge project
to link the state south of the Colorado
river, with the Mohave county "Strip"
(once the home of cattle rustlers) and
the Utah line.
After a trip to the mouth of the
Grand canyon he reports having lo
cated a site for the bridge, which will
be about 500 feet long. Eight miles of
heavy work will bring the highway to
the bridge. The rest of the road work
from both Hackberry and Kingman,
will be easy. The highway will have
a takeoff from the main line into the
Chloride section and on the south to
Kingman or other points. A location
from the river to Grand wash will
be looked over and fhe road on
through to the Utah line will be lo
cated. North of the river considerable
heavy work will be needed to keep
the roadway out. of the washes and
prevent its destruction during the
seasons of torrential rains.
In the main the road will be along
Grand gulch and will be a splendid
scenic route. It will link the National
Old Trails and the Lincoln and other
will also come the irrigation of exten
sive lands along the Colorado river
near the Grand canyon, where fruits
and farm products could be raised al
most every month of the year.

' from Versailles. There was no at
. tempt at oratory and no applause in
i terrupted the address. Nearly every
! senator was in his seat, and all list
ened attentively. Afterward his sup
porters were unstinted' in their praise
for the president's words, while those
opposed either declined to comment or
declared he had dealth only in unsat
isfactory generalities.
Tatks Over Irish Question
In his talks afterward with league
supporters, the president was said to
have discussed at lengTh'the Shantung
and Irish questions. He was quoted
as saying he was not satisfied with
the treaty provision giving Shantung
to Japan, but as declaring there was
an informal understanding among the
peace delegates that eventually Japan
must make an acceptable agreement
with China in the matter. He was
represented as expressing confidence
that Japan would deal rightly in the
final settlement.
Defends Stand on Irish Question
Discussing the failure of the peace
conference to receive the representa
tives of the Irish-American represen
tatives of Irish freedom, Mr. Wilson
was said to have told senators that
the representatives had so identified
themselves with the revolutionary ele
ment in Ireland that it became impos
sible to receive them. He was quoted
as saying that both he and David
Lloyd George, the British premier, had
bee apxlous to arrange for a hearing.
Question of Fiume Not Mentioned
The decision not to bind Germany
to a definite indemnity, the president
was reported to have said, was reach
ed over his protest. He was quoted
as saying he consented to the indeter
minate plan to help Premier Lloyd
George over domestic obstacles.
It was said the question of Fiume
was not mentioned.
To Oppose Any Changes by Senate
In talking to the senators the presi
dent was said to have taken a firm
stand against any reservations in the
senate'B ratification of the treaty. It
was asserted he would not be disposed
kindly even toward interpellated res
ervations to make the senate's deci
sion clear, there always might be
doubt as to whether any particular
reservation really were innocuous or
would vitiate some league principle.
The president also was quoted as say
ing he believed a two-thirds majority
would be necessary to write any reser
vations into the ratification resolution,
but it was said afterward that he prob
ably meant that the reservations, once
a part of the resolution, would have
to have the support of two-thirds of
the senators to secure action when the
ratification vote was taken.
Among the senate leaders the Im
pression has been that only a simple
majority would be required to amend
the ratification resolution, and the
president's reported statement met a
sharp denial from opposing senators,
who cited a senate rule providing that
in considering treaties two-thirds shall
be required for ratification, but only a
majority for all other "motions and
questions" involved.
Concerning the League of Nations, he
said:
"That there should be-a League of Na
tions to steady the counsels and maintain
the peaceful understandings of the world,
to make, not treaties alone, but the ex
pressed principles of international laws
as well, the actual rule of conduct among
the governments of the world, had been
one of the agreement's accepted from the
first as the basis of peace with the cen
tral powers. The statesmen of all the
belligerent countries were agreed that
such a league must Ite created to sustain
the settlements that were to be effected.
But at first I .think there was a feeling
among some of them that, while it must
be attempted, fhe formation of such' a
league was perhaps a counsel of perfec
tion which practical men,, long expe
rienced In the world of affairs, must
agree to very cautiously and with many
misgivings. It was only as the difficult
work of arranging an all but universal
adjustment of the world's affairs ad
vanced from day to day from one stage
of conference to another, that it became
evident to them that what they were
seeking would be little more than some
thing written upon paper, to be inter
preted and applied by such methods as
the chances of politics might utuke avail-
j able if they did not provide a means of
common counsel which all were obliged
to share, a common authority whose de
cisions would be recognized as decisions
which all must respect.
"And so the most practical, the most
, skeptical among them, turned more and
more to the league as the authority
j through which international action was
' to le secured, the authority without
which, as they had come to see it, it
would be difficult to give assured ef
fect either to this treaty or to any other
international understanding upon which
they were to depend for the maintenance
of peace. the league of Na
tions whs not merely an instrument to
adjust and remedy old wrongs, under a
new treaty of peace; it was the only hope
for niiukinil. Again and again had the
demon of war been cast out of the house
of the peoples and the house swept clean
by a treaty of peace."

President Wilson's address to the senate
today as 'another Wilsonian essay, but
not unite up to the standard."
Senator Maiding. Republican, Ohio, a
member of the foreign relations commit
ter, baid the address was "the appenl
of the internationalist and utterly lacking
in ringing Americanism."
Senator Moses, Republican. New
Hampshire, declared the address lo lx: an
"appropriate description of the League
of Rations as an international come on'
gunie and it 'appears to me that any
country that wishes to work the interna
tional badger game will find in the
League of Nations the sliding panel with
which to operate."
"it was a fine comprehensive presenta
tion of the case." said Senator Hitchcock.
Peinocrat. Nebraska. "It was a dispas
sionate nd convincing utnutut of the
reasons that led the representatives of
one billion people to apree on Its re
organization of the world."
Senator McCumber. Republican, North
Dakota, a supporter of the League of
Nations, said the address was "very im
pressive." 'Vrhe address." said Senator Swanson,
Denioci-at. Virginia. "is magnificent,
able, eloquent and inspiring. The reasons
presented for the ratification of the
ratification of the treaty, including the
League of Nations, were strong, cogent
and unanswerable."
"I think." said Senator Williams. Dem
ocrat, Mississippi, "that in breadth of
vision. In height of humanitarianism, in
fundamental world statesmanship, and in
delicacy of dove-tniled Knglish. it is the
greatest thing he has ever uttered. His
words are a fitting close to his magnifi
cent unselfish and upon the whole ef
fective work at Faris."-
"I thought." said Senator Chamberlain.
Democrat. Oregon, "it was a splendid ad
dress, covering th subject concisely and
in a way that- will make its way to the
hearts of the American people."
. . . and of right, a lasting triumph
in the assurance of which men might
everywhere live without fear.
"Old entanglements of every kind
stood in the way promises which gov
ernments had made to one another in
the days when might and right were
confused and the power of the victor
was without restraint.
"Engagements which contemplated
and dispositions of territory, any ex
tensions of sovereignty that might
seem to be to the interest of those
who had the power to insist upon
them had been entered into without
thought of what peoples concerned
might wish or profit by; and these
could not always be honorably brush
ed aside. It was not easy to graft the
new order of ideas on the old and
some of the fruits of grafting may, 1
fear, for a time, be bitter. But, with
very few exceptions, the men who sat
with us at the peace table desired as
sincerely as we did to get away from
the bad influences, the illeglmate
purposes, the demoralizing ambitions,
the international counsels and expe
dients out of which the sinister de
signs of Germany had sprung as a
natural growth. It had been our priv
ilege to formulate the principles wnicn
were accepted as the basis of the
peace, but they had been accomplish
ed not because we had come in to
hasten and assure the victory and in
sisted upon them, but because they
were readily acceded as the princi
ples to which honorable and enlighten
ed minds everywhere had been bred.
They spoke the conscience of the
world as well as the conscience of
America."
"Two great empires had been form
ed into political bankruptcy am; we
were the receivers," the president
said. "There could be no peace until
the whole of central Europe was set
right. ... of peace; only to pre
pare a time when he would enter
again with spirits worse than him
telf. "Convenient, indeed, indespensable
as statesmen found the newly planned
League of Nations, to be for the exe
cution of present plans of peace and
reparation, they saw it in a new as
pect before their work was finished.
They saw it as the main object of the
peace, as the only thing that could
complete it or make it wrorth while.
They saw it as the hope of the world
and that hope they did not dare to dis
appoint. Shall we or any other free
people hesitate to accept this great
duty? Dare we reject it and break
the heart of the world?
"The stage is set, the destiny dis
closed. It has come about by no plan
of our conceiving, but by the hand of
God, who led us Into this way," the
president concluded. "We cannot turn
back. We can only go forward with
lifted eyes and freshened spirit
to follow the vision. It was of this
that we dreamed at our birth. America
shall in time show the way. The light
steams upon the path ahead and no
where else."
ENGINEERS REPORT TONICHI
BRANCH BADLY WRECKED
NOGALES. Ariz., July 10. Complet
ing the first visit by white men to
that section in six years, a party of
engineers ofthe Southern Tacific de
Mexico railroad returned here today
after an inspection trip along the Toni
chi branch of that road, in the Yaqui
river valley in Mexico.
The trip along the branch, approxi
mately 96 miles, was made afoot and
on burros. The gbranch runs deep
into the country inhabited by the
Yaqui Indians. The engineers reported
the road in a very dilapidated condi
tion, bridges burned, culverts blown
up, trees growing between the rails
in some places and hundreds of rail
road ties removed and stolen, presum
ably to be used as fuel.
The trip was made to gather data
whereon a report of damages could
be made to the Mexican government.
FIVE KILLED AND TWO ARE
WOUNDED IN COLLISION
ST. JOHNS. N. F., July 10. Two
men were killed and two injured
when the Allen liner Grampian. Mon
treal for Liverpool, collided with an
iceberg off Cape Race last night. The
steamship, with 750 passengers and
a crew of 350, arrived here this morn
ing for repairs.
The killed and injured were stew
ards who were asleep in the bow or
the ship when she struck. Virtually
all the passengers were awake but,
although there were more than 500
women and children aboard, there
was no panic
Th'at the Grampian did not suffer
the fate of the Titanic, with consider
able loss of life, is believed to have
been due to the decision of the cap
tain to strike the iceberg bow on in
stead of taking a glancing blow o:
the side. The berg, very large. Was
encountered in ' the ' fog 4.T miles oft
Cape Race in the early evening.
The entire fore part of the ship
was smashed in above the water line
the stem being driven back nearly
40 feet. She was undamaged below
the water line.

BY REVIEW
STOCKS AND BONDS
NEW YORK, July 10. Cumulative
indications of increasing monetary
ease and additional evidence of gen
eral industrial revival were controlling
factors in further irregular advance of
the stock market today. Early gains
of 1 to 5 points were partially impair
ed in the later dealings on extensive
offerings, presumably from profes
sional sources.
Initial rates for call loans were 7 to
IVz Per cent against yesterday's open
ing quotations of 9 to 10, as low as 6
being quoted in the final hour, al
though the ruling figure was 7 per
cent.
The increase of slightly more than
600,000. tons in unfilled orders disclos
ed by the June statement of the Unit
ed States Steel corporation marked
the first gain since October of last
year, when productions of iron and
steel began to develop reactionary ten
dencies. Coppers were further stimulated by
purchases for foreign account, includ
ing the Orient.
Oils, motors and their specialties,
equipment and the usual peace indus-1
trials contributed to the fairly large
turnover.
Extensive absorption of shippings
served to bring about a substantial re
bound at the close, steels also rallying
easily. Sales, 1,635,000 shares.
Trading in bonds was light and
without noteworthy changes. Total
sales, par value, $9,750,000. Old Unit
ed States bonds unchanged on call.
THE GRAIN MARKETS
CHICAGO, July 10 Bearish aspects
of the government prop report, to
gether with increasing difficulty of
trading in old crop months led to
acute weakness today in the corn mar
ket. Prices closed heavy l?4c to 3c
net lower with September $1.93 to
$1.93i4 and December $1.58 to $1.58.
Oats gained lc In provisions the
outcome varied from 12c decline to 22c
advance.
Although July and September deliv
eries of corn touch at one time the
highest prices this season, the fact
was evident from the outset that the
position of holders had become
strained. Most of the trading appear
ed to center in the December delivery,
and there was a general effort to dis
courage further dealings in the nearer
months, inasmuch as the scanty sup
ply of old corn seemed too precarious
a basis for the filling of contracts on
a larger scale.
Oats bulged, owing to export sales
and crop damage advices.
Provisions were dull, but averaged
higher with hogs.

his opinion served all but three days of
his sentence. Today he was Informed
by Judge W. C. Jacks who had passed
the original sentence on his that the 55
days under the law could not apply on
his sentence inasmuch as the time served
under a notice of appeal does not apply
to his original sentence in the justice

out why 60 days is not 60 days.
"SIXTY DAYS AND?"
' Judge W. C. Jacks, who will hear the

demeanor. The lady of color in the case
appeared first ttfore the bar of justice.
The Judge after giving her some Judicial
advice and admonition told her that in
view of .her past good record he would
give her 60 days and suspended sen
tence. Her male companion then step
ped up with a confident and Joyous grin
expecting to get the same. Judge Jacks
ays. "Kph. I am going to give you the
same as 'Mandy." At this Kph's grin
was widespread and his ivories gleamed.
But with this difference," continued the
Judge, "you are sentenced to 60 days
and your sentence is not suspended."
When Kph came to the clang of the cell
doors It reminded him that there was a
difference in life letween what one ex
pects and what one receives.

BISBEE RECTOR S
HOI IS ROBBED
The home of the Rev. Thomas Muitt,
rector of the Episcopal church, was en
tered by burglars Wednesday after
noon and the clothing of his son,
Thomas, Jr., was removed from the
house.
No member of the family was there
at the time and the burglar must have
been watching his opportunity, as
none of the neighbors noticed any
strangers around the house.
It was not till one of the daughters
came home late in the afternoon that
the clothing, which was' valued at
around $100, was noticed to be miss
ing. Nothing else of value in the home
was disturbed and It is presumed that
some one needing a new outfit just
helped themselves.
