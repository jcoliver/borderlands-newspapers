UNDATED WAR LEAD. (By the
Associated Press.) Turkey is out of
the war and Germany's remaining ally,
Austria-Hungary, badly defeated on
the field of battle, her battle line rent
in twain and with chaos reigning in
side her border, is pleading for an
armistice. Thus far her importuni
ties have received no better answer
than the redoubling of the efforts of
the allies 10 crush utte'rly her war
riors. The capitulation of Turkey is be
lieved to have been an unconditional
one. The victories or the allied forces
over the Austro-Hungarians threaten
to send what remains of the enemy
armies reeling back to their border
line shattered anc completely van
quished. .
More than 50,000 prisoners have
been taken by the Italian, British,
French, American and Czecho-Slovak
forces and everywhere, from tho
mountain region to the plains of Ve
netia the enemy Is being sorely tried.
In the mountains, where stiff re
sistance bad been offered to keep
the foe from entering the back door

and important strategic positions are
being lost. To the east of the Piave

point of departure, and severed con

north and those on the Venetian

Over the plains leading toward the
Austrian frontier at the Isonzo river
tie invaders everywhere are in fuil
flight, with the allied troops press
ing them hard. Here the debacle
seems to be complete. The enemy in
his flight is leaving behind large
numbers of guns and great quantities
of war stores as he endeavors to
reach the passages over the Taglia
mento river. It seems not improbable
on the plains and in the region east
.and west of Belluno large numbers of
the enemy are destined to be cap

still is little fighting of a violent
character, but the intensive opera
tions of the airmen seems to presage
an early return of battles of major
importance. In Belgium both the.

AIR PROGRAM
Former Republican Candidate
for President, Appointed by
Wilson to Probe Situation,
Renders Report
(By Review T.eaied Wlrs)
WASHINGTON, Oct. 31. The long
awaited report on the aircraft inves
tigation, conducted during the last
five months by Charles E. Hughes,
and Attorney General Gregory was
placed before President Wilson today
and made public.
Delays and wastes of the production
program, the report declares, were
due chiefjy to "defective organiaztion
of the work of aircraft production and
the serious lack of competent direc
tion of that work by the responsible
officers of the signal corps."
No fault is found with the manage
ment of aircrawt affairs since the re
organization of last May which placed
John D. Ryan in charge. The civilian
personnel of the aircraft production
boar J is exonerated of wrong doing.
Attorney General Gregory, in a let
ter transmitting the report to Presi
dent Wilson says he is in "substantial
accord" with the findings by Mr.
Hughes.
The report finds no "graft" in the
generally accepted sense, but makes
recommendations for proceedings
against army officers held guilty or
dealing with corporations in which
they were interested.
The chief waste from the original
appropriation of $691,851,866 the re
port says was in the abandonment of
two types of airplanes one of them
the Bristol and failure to salvage, ag
gregating about $24,000,000. : Figures
show that last May $134,000,000 of
that great appropriation had teen dis
bursed and up to October 1, the exM
penJiture had reached about $140,000,
000 for all aviation purposes. This did
not include expeditures of the sales
department which buys material and
resells it to manufacturers and for
advances for building plants. Con
tracts let however, committed about
$470,000,000 of the fund. The figures
are given in .nswer to the general
charge that the sum had all been ex
pended with practically no results.
The attorney general concludes In
his letter of transmittal "that no such
profits have been allowed as to justify
a charge of bad faith."
Coi. E. A. Deeds, about whom raged
most of the charges which brought on
the investigation, the report recom
mends, should be brought before a
court martial for sending confidential
war department information on the
aircraft situation to former business
associates in Dayton, Ohio, and for
being sponsor last February for a
"grossly misleading statement" to the
effect that the "first American built
battle planes are today en route to
the front in France
Criminal prosecutions of three army
officers are recommended on the
ground that they transacted business
with corporations in which they were
financially interested. These officers
are: Lt. Col. J. G. Vincent, forme?
vice-president of the Packard Motor
Car company, now in charge of the
airplane engineering division of the
aircraft production bureau;. Lt. Col.
George W. Mixter, a stockholder in
the Cnrtiss Airplane and Motor cor
poration, production manager of the
aircraft bureau, and Sec. Lt. Samuel
B. Vrooman, jr., inspector of propeller
lumber, and stockholder in the S. B.
Vrooman company of Philadelphia,
which sold mahogany to the govern
ment for airplanes.
Mr. Hughes concluded his report
with the- statement that "it is not
within the province of this report to
make recommendations with respect
to administrative policy, but it should
be said that under the direction of Mr.
Ryan and Mr. Potter there has been
improvement in organization and pro
gress has been made in gratifying
measures."
William C. Potter, to whom Mr.
Hughes referred, is assistant director
of aircraft production.
The general conclusions and recom
mendations by Mr. Hughes follow:
"The evidence discloses conduct,
which although of a reprehensible
character cannot be regarded as af
fording a sufficient basis for charges
under existing statutes but there are
certain acts shown, not only highly
improper in themselves but of special
significance, which should lead to dis
ciplinary measures. The evidence I
with respect to Col. Edward A. Deeds
should be presented to the secretary
of war to the end that Colonel Deeds
may be tried by court-martial under
articles 95 and 96 of the articles of
war for his conduct (1) in acting as
confidential advisor of his former
business associate, H. E. Talbott of
the Dayton Wright Airplane company.

(By Review Leased Wire)
WASHINGTON, Oct. 31. Presi
dent Wilson cleared np today his
task as intermediary for armistice
and peace pleas of the central
powers, just as press dispatches
were bringing news of Turkey's
surrender and of events foreshad
owing an early collapse of Austro
Hungarian arms.
Formally as well as actually the
whole question of the conditions
on which the war may end now is
before the American and allied
representatives in Paris. The next
step probably will be the decision
of these representatives on armis
tice terms, unless before this is
reached Austria follows the exam
ple of Bulgaria and Turkey and
capitulates in the field before the
great drive that is cutting her
forces to pieces in Italy.
Terms of Armistice
It may be stated that, while the
armistice program which the Germans
await may not differ essentially from
predictions fhat lt will include sur
render of the German navy, disarma
ment of the German armies and occu
pation of German strongholds, the
framing of the program has not been
completed and any informal announce
ments are premature.. Exchanges be
tween the American and allied gov
ernments and discussion among1 the
representatives in France still are in
progress. It was intimated today that
purely military phases of the prob
lem probably had been worked out in
advance by the supreme war council.
but that unhurried deliberations are
necessary to dispose of questions in
volved in the making of permanent
peace which must be dealt with by
finally fixing terms of an armistice.

A fire of mysterious origin, starting

The company was at a loss yester
day to account for the possible origin
of the fire. The watchman, Charles

E
Roosevelt and Taft Join in
Public Statement, Setting
Forth in Logical Terms
Their Position
(By Review Leased Wire)
NEW YORK, Oct. 31. Theodore
Roosevelt and Wm. II. Taft issued
here today a joint appeal for elec
tion cf a republican majority in con
gress. The statement was said to
be the first ever composed and signed
by two former presidents of the
United States.
Seated at a table in the Union
League club, they prepared the state
ment which fallows:
"We approach this subject as Ameri
cans and only as Americans. When
this war broke out we would have
welcome action by the president which
would have eliminated all questions
of party politics. Instead cf this, par
tisian lines have been strictly drawn
from the first and now the president
announces that ' only democrats can
be entrusted with future power and
only those democrats who do his will.
Because of the reflection on other pa
triotic Americans we appeal for fai
play. '
"Tlje next congress will serve from
March" 4, 1919, to March 4. 1921. In
that period the war must be fought
to unconditional surrender, unless this
is achieved before.
"The terms of world peace must be
settled.
"The democratic administration,
after expending billions of treasure
and exercising more absolute power
than any administration in our his
tory must give an account of its stew
ardship. "The change from war conditions to
peace must be brought about with the
least disturbance and the work of re
construction must be broadly begun.
"A republican congress will be much
better qualified than one controlled by
democrats to aid the country in adopt
ing the measures needed for these four
great fasks. First, even as a min
ority party the republicans made the
winning of the war possible by pass
ing the original draft bill. Without
this we could not have trained and
landed the two millions of men now
in France. As a minority party the
republicans forced upon a reluctant
president and secretary of war, aftei
an injurious delay of four month's the
amended draft act, without which we
could not put two more millions as
the front next July. The speaker, the
leader and the chairman of the mili
tary committee of the democratic
bouse opposed the original draft with
all the vigor possible.
"The new senate must approve, by
two-thirds vote, the terms of peace.
These terms should be settled not
by one man only. It is one man con
trol we are fighting in this war to
suppress. The peace treaty must be
approved by the great body of the
American people. The president has
indicated a willingness to make a
peace by negotiations. He has not de
manded as he might have done in
three notes that which the American
people demand, an unconditional sur
render. His exchange of notes with
Germany has caused a deep concern
among our people lest he may by his
partying with her, concede her a peace
around a council table Instead of a
sentence from a court. The fourteen
points which the president and Ger
many assume that they have already
agreed upon are so general and vague
that such a peace would be no treaty
at all, but only a protocol to an in
terminable discussion. The president
Is without final power to bind the
United States to those fourteen points
although his language does not sug:

10 LIVE UP TO
HER CHARACTER
France and England Have Un
bounded Admiration for
This Country, Says Dean
Emery
"France and England have an
unbounded admiration for America
and all things American," declared
Dean Emery, special organizer and
staff man' for the United War Work
campaign, to a group or Warren dis
trict men at a session held in the
Commercial club rooms yesterday aft
ernoon. "And for my part," continued
the speaker, "when fine folks have
an unbounded admiration for me, I
'am not all set up about it; rather I
am always afraid I will disappoint
them. America must live up to her
splendid reputation achieved abroad.
Her war works have been the wonder
of Europe. ' Nothing like them have
ever been known or dreamed of over
there before. Our care and treat
ment of our own soldiers and our
kindness and many benefactions for
all our allies and their women and
children have amazed them and filled
them with admiration and affection
for our great and generous national
heart. They believe we can do any
thing, and do it better than any one
else.
"In the very beginning of the war
France, saw our Y. M. C. A. work, and
said, We want the same thing; not
" an imitation, but the real article. We
will furnish the huts and the attend
ants and the equipment, but we want
you to furnish .the secretaries'; the
idea; we want it to be the same work
in spirit as well as in actuality.' The
Y was the first in the field, that is
alL And after . the two Y associa
tions came the Knights of ColumDus
and the Jewish organizations and the
rest of the seven great war works
that the world has admired and the
government of the United States has
recognized and given official stand
ing as a necessary part of the war.
"The great drive for the United
War work fund will soon begin, and
I am sent here to try to tell you how
fine and how necessary is this work
for our soldier boys in camp here and
in field over there. I wish L could tell
you half of it, but the scope and the
wonder of that work is beyond auy
man's telling and it would take too
long."
He's a man in u thousand to carry
this message, is Mr. Emery. Pleas
ant, plain, forceful, speakiug straight
. out in a language all can understand,
he goes right to the heart ofrL.aad,
better still, he makes people believe
that he believes what he says. He is
a New Yorker, but he speaks the
southwest language. He fairly glowed
while he told of tne fine welcome he
had had everywhere in the southwest.
It was a revelation to him. ,
'They say to me everywhere down
here," he declared, "lell us our quota
and we will raise it.- Up in Flagstaff
the other day the mayor became half
indignant because I was sent to his
town to stir up interest in this work.
He told me to move on. They would
raise their quota, he declaredT of their
own effort and accord. Of course, he
was joking me, and they treated me
fine up there, but it was their spirit
of which I am trying to tell you to
day." The speaker spoke from his heart
when he said: "It will be easier to
raise this fund at this time for this
work than anything the people have
been asked to do yet for this war.
Easier than it was to sell Liberty
bonds at 4 per cent interest and
on gilt-edged, Gibraltar security. The
boys for whose comfort and happiness
and good we are raising fhis money
have been tried since the last drive
and not found wanting over there.
They, have made good. Belleau wood
and Chateau-Thierry and the Marne
and Ft. Mihiel and the Meuse and
Cambrai and the Champagne have all
been written in the book of glory
since- then by these boys; written
with their blood on the points of their
bayonets.
"Instead of seven separate drives
for funds by all these seven war work
organizations, this is one drive for
the seven. They are working togeth
er, these seven, hand in glove; no
overlapping, and still they cannot do

PHOENIX PHYSICIAN
DIES FROM EFFECTS
OF SPANISH FLU
WAS IN BISBEE FEW WEEKS AGO
TO ASSIST IN EXAMINATION OF
REGISTRANTS AT "Y" MAY
HAVE CONTRACTED DISEASE
HERE
According to a copy of the Phoenix
Republican, which arrived here yes
terday. Dr. P. R. Doron, a prominent
physician of that city, died on Sunday
morning of an attack of influenza.
The doctor was in Bisbee a few
weeks ago with a number of other
physicians to assist in the examina
tion of the registered men and made
a number of friends who will regret
to hear of bis death. It was the be
lief of the doctor that be contracted
the disease while he was in this city.
The story as printed in the Republi
can is as follows:
"Dr. P. R. Doron, 412 North Seventh
avenue, who died Sunday morning of
Spanish influenza, gave up his life for
his country, according to the local
board yesterday.
"Dr. Doron contracted influenza
while at Bisbee with several other
Phoenix physicians last week. The
doctors went to Bisbee to assist
Cochise county physicians in making
physical examination of men reg
istered there for military service.
"Dr. Doron was among the first of
the physicians of Maricopa county to
volunteer his services to the govern
ment when the call came for medical
men to examine registrants. He was
present at many of the examinations
the past several months and was held
in high esteem by all of the medical
fraternity of the county for his ex
cellent judgment and skill.
"This faithful physician died with
out having made ample provision for
his family, according to Secretary
Martin T. Weyant of the local board,
who has asked the medical associa
tion and other public-spirited organi
zations to give this matter fall con
sideration. "Two sisters of Mrs. Doron will
reach Phoenix today from Los Ange
les to attend the funeral, the time of
which had not been decided upon last
night."

sad or Rino of Spain informing him
that the Turkish request that he pro
pose an armistice and peace negotia
tions, delivered by the ambassador,
October 14, had been transmitted by
the president to the governments at
war with Turkey. Later the .secretary
announced that the last Austrian com
munication supporting a similar ap
peal with acceptance of the stipulation
of coiupfete independence for subject
nationalities, had been forwarded to
America's co-belligerents. Miuister
Ekengren of Sweden, in charge of Au
strian interests was so informed verb
ally, the president apparently having
decided that it was unnecessary to
send the written reply he was report
ed yesterday to be preparing.
One Unanswered Note
This leaves one note unanswered,
that of Count Andrassy, the Austrian
foreign minister, asking Secretary
Lansing to intervene with the presi
dent for favorable action on Austria's
request. Since the president already
has acted Mr. Lansing probably will
make no reply.'
Great satisfaction over the day's
developments was evident everywhere
here, American and allied military
men expressed the opinion that the
only question now is whether Ger
many will seek to delay the inevitable
by fighting a desperate defensive cam- j
paigu alone, or accept the surrender
terms now being framed.

Guard duty is the work left for the
military forces the allies may consider
necessary to keep. For the allied nav

Officially neither the Washington
government nor the allied embassies (

Only through press dispatches did
they learn of the fall of Turkey, and
they had no information through
their own channels of the reported ac
tion of the Austrian commander on
the Italian front in applying direct
ly to General Diaz, the Italian com
mander in chief, for an armistice.
President Wilson spent a large part
of the afternoon at the state, war and
navy buildings in the offices of Secre
taries Lansing and Baker. He walked
over from the White House soon after
word came of Turkey's collapse, but
there were indications that his talk
with the war and state secretaries had
not so much to do with the interesting
events on the battle fronts as with the
exchanges constantly going on be
tween the president and Colonel
House and the American representa
tives on the supreme war council.
President Smiles Broadly
When he left Secretary Lansings
office late in the afternoon wjtn .:- j
retary Bak'jr. President Wilson wore;
a broad smile. Ho remarked as he
emerged into the hall, crowded with
two score newspaper men, "this mienis j
to be a very curious croud," but be ;
said nothing to satisfy the curiosity j
of the correspondents. '
The disposition of European Turkey j
and the Dardanelles is a question
brought suddenly to the front by lb
armistice which ha cmli'd Turkey's
career as an ally of Gtrmany. Oa-J
thing is regarded here as virtually cer-
tain the Dardenelles will never again
be under the domination of Turkey.
Great Britain and France are deter
mined upon this and the American
government has voiced its approval of
their position.
FIRE DAMAGE TO
SUPPLIES QUITE
HEAVY YESTERDAY
iContlnued from Page One)
the fire became visible and efforts to
fight it were made by the few men on
the grounds. However, before a
stream could be gotten on "It the ex
tremely inflammable material in the
north end of the building was ablaze
and fire broke through the roof. Both
the Bisbee and Lowell fire depart
ments were called, the Bisbee depart
ment arriving in very short time and
proceeded to set up its pump which
gave good pressure on one line. This
was responsible chiefly for the failure
of the fire to spread to other build
ings. The Lowell shaft house was in
intimate danger, whHe only the hard
work of firemen kept the flames from
spreading to the tlmuer yard, where
many thousands of dollars worth of
mine timbers were pUed. The absence
of a breeze also helped save the situa
tion when the south end of the build
ing was attacked by the fire and it
appeared for a time that there was
danger of it leaping the gap between
the supply and oil house, where quan
tities of oil and gasoline were stored.
As the flames attacked carboys of
chemicals stored in the building and
the containers were broken there
came a scries of explosions ranging
in intensity from the force of a small
arms bullet to much heavier ones.
Gas, generated by the chemicals,
mounted in hot, white flame, melting
the corrugated iron and consuming it
as though it had been paper.
Within an hour the fire was entirely
under control and when. the whistle
blew for the mornin? shift to go on
duty a large gang of Mexicans was at
work clearing away such of the debris
as was sufficiently cool to be handled
while water was poured on the tlames
freni the several lines of hose.
That the fire did not spread to tho
Lowell shaft was considered by the
fire fighters extremely fortunate as
there was the double chance of its
going by way of the shaft house and
by a tunnel which connects with the
shaft from the timber yatd. The fire
men, both regulars and volunteer, de
serve high credit for their work. But
for a lack of water pressure in the
beginning better work could have
been done. As it was, they did all
that men could be expected to ac
complish, even savisz the wooden
platform which ran around the build
ing on the outside.
The burning of the supply dapart
ment very probably will create a bad
condition in the company properties
for the time being, as many of the
supplies probably will be exceedingly
difficult if not impossible of replace
ment under existing war conditions
However, every effort will be made by
the company tn maintain normal work
ing conations, despite the difficulties
inherent in tne situation.
J. J. Jonss, chief of the Lowell fire
department, stated yesterday that he
wished to tnank the Bisbee depart
ment for responding to the alarm and
assisting so niatenaiiy in fighting the

"The absence of proper appreciation
of the obvious impropiety of transac

the conclusion that public policy de

recommended that the officers found

pecuniary profits of which they had
an interest, should be prosecuted un

a member of tne jury, was excused
ironi the panel today. Bowen told
Lieut. Com. Newberry that the grand
jury had declined to indict him on a
charge of violating the federal cor

Bowen was arraigned on a present
ment based on a statement in a New

made to Commander Newberry by a
member of the grand jury, and on an
admission by Bowen before the jury
that it was he who ha i made the dis

on the presentment until next Thurs

called at the office of the commandant
of the Third Naval district, where
Mr. Newberry, former secretary of

Concerning peace problems. Sir

should be the perfecting or an "eco

allied nations which in effect already
is in existence and an agreement on
economic principles to be applied In
the relations of such an association.
Frank A. Vanderlip, president of

warning of the danger of political con
troversy in this time of crisis."
"I believ4 the voice of the people

indeed have the right ourselves to

Vorwaerts points out the utter
hopelessness of Germany's position
with Austria absent from the field.
"It now can be said with a high
degree of probability that the duration
of the war can be measured by days,
declares the paper.
Other German newspapers have not
yet so completely abandoned all hope
but this may be due to the fact that
none of them, except Vorwaerts, ap
pears to have expected Austria s de
sire to capitulate.
Theodor Wolff, in the Ferlin Tage-
blatt, still thinks that "so long as
Germany's power has npt callapsed
there are limits to the possibilities of
the guarantees that the entente may

Pounds Wants Others

"I have not only gained ' twenty i
pounds since I began taking Taniac, j
but it has done me so much good that j
my doctor after seeing the improve- i
ment this medicine brought, advised
me to keep on taking it." declared'.

"I feel so grateful for Taniac, I don't j
know what to say," continued Mrs. j
Bieal. "For three years I suffered '
such agony with my stomach, that I !
wasn't able to do a thing around the
house. In fact, I was hardly able to
get around at all. I completely lost
my appetite, and what 1 did force
dowa caused me so much pain, I could
hardly stand it. Of course this got
my nerves in a terrible condition, and
I hardly knew what it was to sleep at
night. I'd just roll and toss until
morning.
"At last I got so bad off that I was
taken to the hospital, and had an ope
ration performed. I was there for
five weeks, and when I finally got
back home, I was a perfect wreck. I
was so weak I couldn't move around
the house at all and had to stay right
in bed and my husband had to leave
his work and wait on me. I had the
best attention I could get but nothing
seemed to give me any strength ana
although I tried to get up and move
around, it was no use. I was too
weak; I just couldn't do it. Every
body insisted that I go back to the
hospital, but I said, 'No." I had been
through so much I just couldn't bear
the thought of going back there again.
"Then I decided to try Taniac, as I
had heard so much about it and it's
the honest truth this medicine did
more for me than I ever thought any
thing could do. I have taken six bot-:
ties now, and my stomach is in splen- j
did condition. I have a fine appetite !
and can eat anything I want and never
suffer the least bit afterwards.
"Taniac certainly has built me up
wonderfully, just think, before I took
it, I didn't-have strength enough to set
my own table, and now I can do every
bit of my housework, even to the
washing, if necessary, and I sleep like
a child and wake up in the mornings
feeling refreshed and full of life. I've
gained twenty pounds and look so
well that my doctor told me to keep
right on taking Taniac. and you may
be sure I'm going to do it. I'm glad I
for everyone to know what Taniac has j
done for me and hope the story of my
case will help other sufferers to get j

A Bisbee man who has a soldier boy
with the British army up near Ostend on
the Belgian coast and another with the
Americans down near Verdun has had a
letter from both of them recently. And
each message, singularly enough, ended
with the plea, "stay with the soldier boys
over here; no tongue or pen can tell what
our prisoners and wounded endure from
the hands of the Hun." And this Bisbee
man gives it free and strong as his opin
ion that a vote for a pacifist congressman
is not staying with the soldier boys by any
manner of means.
Shall we spend twenty billions and upsel
the country from end to end and assemble
four million fighting men and strip to the
waist for war, and then nothing but words
and a German peace come of it? God
forbid ! Shall France and Belgium be loot
ed and tortured and England drained of
the blood of her young manhood for four
terrible years, and then stand by silent and
supine while Wilson and the kaiser talk
of peace and agree in pleasant and friendly
fashion upon the terms, conditions and de
tails and the American nation bear the
stigma and the blame? God forbid? Let
us all join the Unconditional Surrender
clubs that are forming over the country
and gaining members by the hundreds of
thousands every week.
And it was written: Bulgaria shall not
tread the winepress alone. Others shall
come after her, pressing the same, hard,
steep path with humble feet. The unspeak
able Turk and the hapless Hapsburg of
Austria. It is the UNCONDITIONAL SUR
RENDER PATH, and it is not marked or
blared by a single one of President Wilson's
fourteen conditions. Only one condition
here. Simple, plain, unalterable and inex
orable. Surrender first; conditions after
wards. And Germany, too, must tread
this path. Soon or late, just as she elects to
do. The Bulgarian way is the only way to
peace for any of the central powers. Notes,
eloquence, conditions, statesmanship, di
plomacy, peace talk and peace piffle, all
notwithstanding. Wilson can dicker with
Berlin to his heart's content, but a majority
of the allies, a majority of the American
congress, an overwhelming majority of the
American people, insist upon German sur
render, complete and unconditional, or war
to the bitter end. The same for all of them,
the Bulgar, the Turk, the Austrian and the
Hun; outlaws all; they must come in and
surrender and abide the consequences of
their crimes or they must die with their
boots on. .
This column has pointed out more than
once that the bad effects of President Wil
son's notes to Berlin, no matter how harsh
or how filled with conditions they might
be, lie in the future, like germs that propa
gate, and not in the immediate present.
These note3 might be, and they were, hailed
with satisfaction at the time in this country
and in the allied capitals, but after a few days
their inevitable ill effects begin to appear.
To treat with Germany at ail is dangerous.
This is the sum and substance of it all. No
matter how clever and skillful and stern
and resolute the president might stamp his
notes, their dangerous and ill effects are
certain as taxes and sure as death. Here is
a case in point: A London dispatch of yes
terday voices the real British fears and dis
approval after all the polite things have
been said. This dispatch, which is semi
official at least, says: "The greatest hope
of the old guard in Germany, judging from
German papers, appears to be to drive a
wedge between President .Wilson and the
allies and make the president play mediator,
instead of belligerent." And there is but
little in the president's notes and speeches
to dispel the German hope and the British
fear. In fact, he refers to the allies and to
the United States as. separate and distinct
in this war, when in fact and in desire and
in pride of allegiance we are one; all allies
together; equal and individual; with the
same aims, resolution and sacrifices to the
end.
The Warren district is entering its fourth
week cf quarantine from the influenza, all
meetings, churches, schools, and entertain
ments having been barred for this period of
time. This quarantine is as irksome and
as costly to many firms and individuals of
the district as it is necessary. It should be
raised as soon as possible with safety. It
should be maintained to the last day need
ful with public health and the check of the
disease, and it should be lifted the first day
the danger is passed. In the east where
the disease raged ten times worse than in
the west, the quarantine is being lifted from
city after city by the health authorities as
soon as conditions warrant. El Paso an
nounces an early relief from its restric
tions, and so does Kansas City, both places
having had a most severe siege of it. The
Arizona state health authorities announce
a probability of the suspension of the quar
antine early in next week, and is inclined
to leave local conditions to the judgment
of local boards and officials. This is as it
should be. The crest of the epidemic has
been passed in this state and district. As
soon as possible the restrictions should be
suspended. Churches, schools, theaters
and assembly halls should be opened as
soon as possible, for the inconvenience, loss
of business and hampering of all kinds of
war work as a result of the quarantine are
matters that must be considered by every
board of health. Recent reports on influ
enza conditions in the Warren district indi
cate that the worst is over here, the num
ber of cases, old and new, being very ma
terially reduced in the past few days and
decreasing steadily, the best showing since
the epidemic broke out here being made
yesterday.
A subscriber called on this column per
sonally the other day to ask about one par
ticular part of Amendment One Hundred
that was worrying him. "This proposed
compensation law abrogates all existing
laws," he said, "and yet does not abso
lutely require that all employers of labor
come under its regulation. What I want
to know is, if an employer does not come
under the new law what chance has an in
jured workman of his to collect reasonable ..
compensation?" This column considers
ths a good point to consider, and doubtless,
one that enemies of the amendment have
used with many voters not thoroughly in
formed as to the acts and purposes of the
law. While it is true that the proposed law '
does not compel all employers to come
under its workings by specific terms and
penalties, yet it is so constructed that it
makes it impossible for them not to come
under it. Outside of thi3 law and its agree
ments the employer of labor would not
have a leg to stand on in court. Every
act or particle of law behind which he might
take refuge is swept away by this new law.
There would be no limitation to the dam
ages he might have to pa . The workman
can always bring suit for injury and for
damages in a court under the common law
and both sides in the suit take their chances
with the jury and the court. Whereas under
a compensation act there are agreements as
to precedents and to damages and to pro
cedures. The employer who elects to eo
it alone, if this new law is adopted would,
in a manner, be beyond the pale. He might
have to pay much for accidents in his plant,
or he rnight pay a little less, with the odds
much in favor of the former. But all the
large employers of labor in the state have
already pledged themselves to come under
the provisions of amendment one hundred,
and all employers, large and small, will
hasten to come under it if it is adopted, for
the simple and practical reason that it is so
framed that they cannot afford not to do so.
The proposed law provides a more liberal
renumeration to the injured workmen and
a larger sum to the dependents of a work
man who happens to be killed; it make3 it
easier for workman or dependents to col
lect, and it makes it surer of collection and
within a shorter period of time. In fact,
the only class really hurt by the proposed
amendment is the class of the damage suit
attorney and the agitator who lives and
thrives by means of his attacks generally
upon capital of any and all kinds. There
is no "nigger in the woodpile" of this law
that can come out after it is passed, its f rant
ers would be wise enough as well as decent
enough to see to that, for the reaction of
such a thing would cause them ten times
more harm in the long run than the enact
ment or defeat of any compensation law.
Only thoughtless or prejudiced or unin
formed persons will be led astray by the
efforts of a few agitators and rabble rouscrs
to defeat this amendment. It has been tried
and tested in other states and labor gener
ally has found it a blessing and a sure aid in
time of trouble.
Atwood Clogs Wheels of
Road Projects in County,
Shown by Correspondences
Hon. B. M. Atwood, state engineer and Arizona representative of the
United States highway council, has blocked indefinitely and perhaps perma
nently, construction on highways of vital importance to the state and this
county, and how he has withheld from the hands of the Cochise county
highway commission information and rulings of the United States high
way council, to purposely prevent construction of the main arteries of the
proposed Cochise county road system has come to light following the receipt
in the district of telegrams from Senator Henry Ashurst, of Arizona, and
from the national highway council.
The history of the successive attempts of the commission shows many
efforts, to get the county highway work under way and exposes the at
tempts of the state engineer to hold up the work. Facts in the case show

Text of Ruling
Following Is the text of the ruling:
"lhe following ruling supplement
ing Circular No. 21, issued September
3, l'J18, has on this 2tith day of Sep

and others engaged in the construc

authorized to continue such construc

in connection therewith may continue
to furnish same for such construction

cations for permits should be promptly
made to the United States high coun

which cannot be completed prior to
November 1. No new contracts for the

to November 1 without first obtaining
a permit from the United States high
way council through the state high

(Signed) "L. W. PAGE.
"Chairman U. S. Highway Council."
Omitted Important Clause
Oa October 30, one week after the
stata highway department had sup
plied the Cochise county highway
commission with the above ruling, the
highway commission received another
copy of the same ruling through an
other source, and discovered that Mr.
Atwood's office had omitted the most
Important clauses from the copy
which he had furnished. This Is the
final paragraph, which provided those
with applications pending an oppor
tunity to secure necessary materials
for construction prior to November 1.
The paragraph which was omitted
from the copy prepared for the Co
chise county highway commission by
Mr. Atwood's office follows:
"You understand of course that the
foregoing amendment will apply to
such of the applications already sub
mitted through your department to
the united States highway council as
conform to the terms of the amend
ment as well as to such projects of
this character not yet submitted. I
suggest that you go over the list of ap
plications submitted and that you take
steps to notify such of the applicants
as are entitled to the benefit of this
amendment. I shall write JjU in
greater detail a little later on.
"Very truly yours,
"L. W. PAGE, Chairman."
A, Pertinent Question
It can be very readily seen that the
Cochise county work was entitled to
the benefit of this amendment, had
they known that such amendment was
in force. Why did the state engineer
omit the last paragraph from the
copies of the telegram that he furnish
ed Cochise county highway commis
sion one month atter receipt and then
only upon request?
A3 a consequence, the highway com
misison of Cochise county will be tied
after November 1, as no materials
can be delivered although contracts
for the saiuo have been awarded for
some time. In other words, all of the
work that is well under way has been
arbitrarily held up by the state engi
neer. If Mr. Atwood bad fulfilled his
duties as the Arizona representative

Purposely Neglectful?
It appears to interested parties that
the state engineer as representative of
the United States highway council,
has purposely neglected his duty as
federal representative in failing to
notify those engaged in highway con
struction of the orders of the United
States highway council.
Is not Mr. Atwood using his posi
tion as a federal representative of the
United States highway council as a
club over the Cochise county highway
commission to force them to acknow
ledge his direction of this construc
tion after the people of this county
had voted that this money be expend
ed under the directions of a highway
commission approved by them when
they voted the bonds? Mr. Atwood
like the balance ot the present admin
istration has let his prejudice against
Cochise county wrap his honest judg
ment in these road matters as per his
letter quoted above.

harm
Every day for the past few weeks
hundreds of automobiles, driven by at
least weil-to-do people, have passed
swiftly by a little tent pitched by the
side of the paved roadway as it
passes over the hill just beyond
Lowell and to war 4 Warren. If any of
the drivers or the passengers in these
machines had looked toward the tent
in the morning or evening hour of
their passing they might have seen
an old man, stocky or build, with
gray whiskers and hair, bending over
a little campfire before the tent, or
standing erect. looking wistfully to
ward the far horizon, that curtain of
blue and white and gray from whence
all good dreams come and to which
all fond hopes and supplications axe
sent, often upon unspoken wings, but
nevertheless expressed by the dumb
and suffering spirit. .
How many people have stopped
their cars on the hill and alighted
to address a word of hope ox en
couragement to that old man? How
many have offered to help him in his
misfortune ?
Surely no pilgrim in all this Tale
of tears has had more trouble, trial
and tribulation than this old man and
his family and his partner, all of
whom calL this tent home. It will be
remembered that it was this family
who were driving in the car that was
struck by the train Just below the
Corta crossing on the way to Osborne
a few days ago. The little girl was
killed and two other members of the
family badly hurt and this old man
stunned and shattered by the stroke
from the train.
But it U probably not known that
misfortune had been traveling with
them before they met that fateful
train. This old man and his partner
and their families were living in a
pleasant valley near Fresno, Cal., a
tew months ago, where they mada a
living from their gardens and their
fruit trees. There came a chance to
trade their holdings there to a man
for a ranch near Willcox, Ariz. So
they disposed of their gear and fur
nishings and drove eastward In Hheir
car to go on this ranch. But when
they reached -Willcox they found that
the ranch had already been sold. Pay
ments for their household and farm
gear failed to materialize. They could
not sell their California land and so
they drove on down here on the
chance of getting work. Then came
the tragedy of the railroad crossing.
Then the waiting for word and help
from friends and kin back on the
coast. But instead of help came word
of more misfortunes.
The old man of the tent told it all
to the newspaper man last evening.
Told it in that monotone between
hope not yet dead and despair not
yet come. His son's wife had just
died and another son was ilL He him
self was penniless. A man had sent
provisions to the tent that bad lasted
a week or more. This seemed to be
a rich community; he did not believe
it would pass him entirely by. He
would get on somehow, he thought.
Soon he would be recovered from the
accident and could do a little work.
The folks at the hospital were a little
better; just a little. One child had
been sent back to the coast with the
corpse of the little girl. Yes, kin
back there had sent for them. His
car was wrecked. But with a little
help now he could get by. he thought.
es. he had a few beans for supper.
For breakfast? He did not know.
Maybe there would be a little some
thing. Now this newspaper man does not
believe the people here know or
understand about this case of this
tent and this old man and his family
and bis misfortunes. If it did, more
cars would stop on the hffl that
throws its shadow over the little tent.
Just a little food for the hungry and
a woid of sympathy and kindness for
the unfortunate; that is all. If you
want to help and have no car, leave
a little food at The Review office and
the newspaper man will add his mite
and leave it there at the tent. This
old man is a simple, kindly, gentle old
man: a type of many thousands of old
men from bark east or on the Pacific
roust, whose sons have come and
built up this part of the west. Mis
fortune has suddenly laid a heavy
hand on him; that is all.
The next time the Junkers start a
war they will have tUe stopper within

BECKETT 18 MM
CAPTAIN IN ARMY
AND I8JR1INC
Assistant to President of the
Fhelps Dodge Company Is
Granted Leave of Absence
Daring War
P. G. Beckett, assistant to the presi
dent of Phelps Dodge corporation with
headquarters in New York, has been
granted a leave of absence by Presi
dent Walter Douglas and has been
commissioned a captain in the engi
neers. He is now in a training camp.
Mr. Beckett came to Arizona in
1904 and for two years thereaftar was
connected with the engineering, de
partment of the Copper Queen Con
solidated Mining company. In 1909
he was in charge of the Sierra de
Cobre property at Cananea and after
a year there accepted the appointment
of superintendent of the Capillitas
Copper company of Argentine, South
America, returning to the Copper
Queen iu 1908. During 1909 and 1910
Mr. Beckett was superintendent of the
nroiwrties which PheiDS Dodge had
under option at Courtland, and in 1911
ha again returned to Bisbee to accept
the position of assistant superintenu
ent of the Copper Queen mines. In
1912 he was appointed general mana
ger of the Old Dominion Copper Min
ing & Smelting company at Globe,
whjch position he resigned to become
assistant to Walter Douglas, president
of Phelps Dodge corporation.
His absence will work a very dis
tinct hardship on the company, but in
his new capacity his ability and ex
perience will make him of great value
to the government.
In the same condition. The latter was
caught just the day before that of
McErlane, in Alamagordo, N. M. The
local officers and others interested in
the reward will not receive the money
until the claim is presented by the
sheriff's office of this county to the
county board in Chicago.
OF INTEREST TO SOUTHERNERS.
A fund is being raised by the south
erners of this district to furnish a
bed in a Red Cross hospital in Paris.
Southerners In all the states are
contributing to this - fund. Three
wards of beds have been supplied and
a fourth partly filled. Six hundred
dollars is needed for each bed. Three
hundred and thirty-five dollars have
been donated and the committe earn
estly hopes that those southerners
whom the committee has not been
able to reach personally will send a
contribution to Mrs. CM. Lynn,
treasurer, box 8445, Warren.
WAS IN CITY.
A. C. Karger, clerk of the Board
of supervisors, was In the city yester
day, on business connected with his
office. He is quite busy these days
getting the election supplies together
for distribution to the various pre
cincts. The 20.000 ballots that are
to be used were delivered by the
Review, which had the contract, on
Wednesday and the other supplies are
being received. Machines will be
started out on Sunday morning with
the entire supplies. The polling places
In this county will be the same as in
the primary in September.
PROMINENT VISITORS.
Hon. T. A. Hughes and Jesse Yoa
kum, the former of Bisbee and the
latter of Warren, were welcome vis
itors in Douglas yesterday. Mr.
Hughes is one of the democratic nom
inees for the state senate and came
for his campaign. In the primary he
only made on short trip to Douglas
and ran ahead of his ticket. His elec
tion is assured. Yoakum refused to
talk about anything except the rapid
growth of his home town where a
vast number of residences have been
constructed during the last two years.
This work is still going ahead with
out hinderance. as the building of
Jiomes in Warren Is regarded as nec
essary war work, as they are required
for the comfort of those engaged in
the production of copper. Douglas In
ternational WOULD RECRUIT.
Instructed by Jack Angus, ex
aminer and district organizer for the
federal labor board with headquarters
at Tucson, to recruit as many white,
negro and Mexican laborers as pos
sible for work on the government con
struction at Portsmouth, Va., W. J.
Wilbert or this city now is actively
engaged in following Instructions. It
is preferable that the Mexicans who
have some knowledge of English and
because of the nature of the work, no
enemy aliens will be accepted. There
will be separate barracks at Hamp
ton Roads for whites and negroes. The
wages are 40 cents an hour or $4.40
per day. Room and board cost $1
per day. It is desired to get 30O
laborers from the state. They will
start to Portsmouth from Tucson
about November 8.
SHOULD BEWARE OF
SHREWD BOOK AGENT
According to word reaching here
from other southwestern cities, there
is a book agent working this Fection
of the country under the camouflage
! of governmental sanction. He is said
to be selling a cook book which he
claims is issued by the food adminis
tration. The price of the "libro" is
$4.75, cash.
Now, the government never author-
Ji?es anyone to sell books and it never

number is 11 and let a policeman
talk to the man. The United States
food administration has issued warn

INFLUENZA EPIDEMIC
IMPROVING IN THE
WARREN DISTRIGT
FEWER CASES REPORTED IN
PAST FOUR DAYS; QUARANTINE
MAY BE LIFTED IN TEN DAYS;
SOME PLACES IN STATE MAY
OPEN SCONER
The influenza epidemic in the War
ren district, judging from reports of
cases to the local health oificers, has
reached the apex and the officials
now look for a gradual reduction in
the number of cases. There have
been two deaths since Wednesday.
There are a number of patients in the
district who have very bad cases of
pneumonia and several who are quite
ill with iniluenza. The number of
new cases reported among the older
people has been materially reduced
since the first of the week, but the
number of cases among the smaller
children has. increased. The total
number of cases reported, however.
is much smaller for the past four days
than at any time since the uTsease
made its appearance here.
In regard to the lifting of the quar
antine Dr. Hunt, the county health
officer, stated last night that he could
not see where it would be sale to Hit
it for another week. He thought, per
haps, that it might be lifted on Mon
day, November 11, but it all depends
on how the conditions improved.'. If
they continue to improve as they have
in the past few days it may be lifted
then.
According to a dispatch 'from Phoe
nix, Dr Brown, the state health offi
cer, is contemplating the lifting of
the quarantine in some parts of the
state on next Monday. The dispitch
says :
PHOENIX, Ariz., Oct, 31. Dr. H.
O. Brown, state health officer, has
under consideration the matter of
lifting the state quarantine on next
Monday. Whether the quarantine will
be lifted then, acording to a state
ment by Dr. Brown depends upon the
continuation of improved conditions
throughout the state, as ha3 been
shown during the past few days.
Dr. Brown stated today that it is
probable that the local health authori
ties will be instructed to handle the
situation, according to local condi
tions. To this extfcnt, it is thought
the state quarantine order, issued by
Dr. Brown, may be modified.
The state health officer is today en
gaged in receiving reports and goiug
into the situation thoroughly so as to
determine the advisability of modify
ing hi3 orders.
"Health authorities in the various
communities will, of course, be in a
lar better position to determine the
situation with respect to their local
communities than would this office,"
said Dr. Brown. 'Tor this reason I
am contemplating putting each local
or county health officer in entire
charge of his jurisdiction with full
power to act on lifting the quaran
tine. "In the event that the quarantine is
lifted, however, this office will insist
on rigid precautionary measures. In
conference with local theater men
yesterday, all of whom seemed anxious
to co-operate with this office to pre
vent a spread of the disease, it was
practically decided tliai certain dis
infectants should be used after each
performance.
"This olik-e will further insist that
oil mops and oil -dust cloths be used
after each performance; that all seats
be washed with hot water ana salt at
least once each day and that all
ushers be instructed to watch per
sons who have roughs or colds. Per
sons who are so affected and do not
use precautionary measures against
the spread of the germs must be ex
pelled from the theaters. The same
measures must be observed in all
churches," he concluded.
EL PASO OPENS MONDAY.
EL PASO, Tex., Oct. 31. Schools
in the American districts will be re
opened Monday, courts will recon
vene and the moving picture theaters
and other places of amusement are
expected to resume after three weeks'
quarantine because of the influenza
epidemic here. This was announced
by the city board of. health today.
The epidemic has abated until there
are only a few cases being treated in
the local hospitals and these are
mostly pneumonia cases which de
veloped from influenza.

TO SIM NOW
FOR WAR WORK
Cochise County Expected to
Raise Fund of $70,600 to
Be Devoted to This Good
Purpose
At the sugeestion of President Wil
so:i. tiie campaign ior raising money
to pay the expense of the various
agencies heretofore engaged in war
work, has been consolidated. Instead
of nicking separate campaigns for
each of these agencies, as has been
done in the past, it is planned to have
one campaign known as the United
War Work campaign. The seven
agencies participating are the Young
Men's Christian association, the Youn
Women's Christian association. War
Camp Community service, American
Library association. National Catholic
War council. Jewish Welfare board
and the Salvation army.
The national budget to be raised
calls for at least $170,500,000. The
quota for the state of Arizona is
$300,000. The quota for Cochise
county is $70 600. The Cochise county
organization is as follows:
G. H. Dowell, chairman; J. N.
Gaines, director; J. P. Connolly, treas
urer. Executive committee: S. F. Fraser,
Y. M. C. A.; J. F. Fitzpatrick, Na
tional Catholic War council; Mrs. C.
S. Thompson, Y. W. C. A.; A. J.
Ingersoll, War Camp Community serv
ice; .Mrs. C. H. Vail, Anier!an Li
brary association; David Benshimol,
Jewish Welfare board; Capt. B. De
Rond, Salvation army.
Local chairmen: J. C. Ryan, Bis
bee; M. C. Hankins, Douglas; Mrs. A.
Y. Smith, Sulphur Springs Valley;
John C. Gung'l, Willcox: A. G. Smita,
Benson; A. H. Gardner, Tombstone;
Dr. J. L. Alexander, San Siilion; Mrs.
J. K. Symonds, Bowie; J. T. Tong,
Johnson; John Pemberthy, Gleeson;
i. D. Ross, r., publicity chairman;
E. A. Putnam, chairman of speakers'
bureau.
Organizations for work with proper
committees will be perfected in th;.
various towns and districts of the
county within the next few days. The
time from now until November 11 will
bo' devoted exclusively to educational
work and explanation of the need of
the money to be raised. The week
beginning with November 11 and end
in? November 18 will be devoted to
the drive for subscriptions for this
worthy cause.
Every one is more or less familiar
with the great benefits our boys at
the front are receiving through the
work of these different agencies and
every one will have an opportunity to
learn yet more in rrgard to the prac
tical workings of these aeencies an.t
the splendid benefits received by the
boys in khaki, both at home and ou
foreign soil. Whole-hearted co-operation
ii expected to be given to the
chairmen and committees in each
comimity and. as in all previcua
drives, Cochise county will no doubt
go '"over the top" with a handsome
margin. The executive committee
will publish the quotas for the differ
ent districts of the county in the near
future.
TWO MEN BEAT POKER
GAME IN DOUGLAS
BOTH HADSIX FULL
HOLD UP GAMBLERS AND GET
AWAY WITH SEVEN HUNDRED
DOLLARS PLAYERS APPEAL
TO OFFICERS BUT NOTHING
DOING
DOUGLAS, Ariz., Oct. 31. When
two or three slick guys are running
a poker game and most likely they
use marked cards and the game is
crooked because the men who run it
must make a pretty fair percentage
to make a living and they seem to be
making a pretty good living at that,
who is to b!ame when a couple of
fallows come in unexpectedly with
handkerchiefs over their faces and
hold up the whole bunch?
Deputy Sheriff Percy Bow-den de
cided that tlfe men who dfil the hold
up stunt were no worse than the
gamblers ,who hold up their victims
with cards and he refused to interfere.
At 2 o'clock this morning he was
notified by some one at the Douglas
hotel, situated across the railroad
tracks from the E. I. S. W. pas
senger station, just oatsido the city
limits, that two holdup men had
jumped in on a poker game in one of
the rooms of the hotel, lifted $700 in
change from the table and got away
with the loot.
"They're welcome," answered Percy
Over the phone. "Please don't bother
me. I'm sTepy and want to go back
to bed."
The hotel people had picked the
wrong officer for help. It so hap
pened tVat Bowden had raided gamb
ling games in the same hotel five
(fines in the last 23 days. On each
occasion the men who rim the games
)d been fined $100 by Justice of the
Pence Donohoe of Pirtloville. Bow-j
den figured that if the card men !
could afford to pay $nin in fines in !
20 days the loss of $700 would not
hurt them much and declined to In
terfere In what might be called the
double holdup.
The poker men, it seems, have been
hiring rooms in the hotel for carrying
on their games.
The holdups are described as tall
and short. The tall man had on a
plaid mackinaw and checkered cap.
The small man had on a dark suit
of clothes.
The records of Justice of the Peace
Donohoe show that W. H. Tully was
arrested this month at the Douglas
hotel charged with runnrng a gamb
ling game there and forfeited a bond
of $100. There have been four other
arrests there in the last few weeks,
the bond being forfeited by . the de
fendants in the same manner.
Tully. however, was not Involved in
last night3 affair,, because he is now
on a hunting trip in Mexico.
SUGAR ALLOTMENT IS
INCREASED BY HALF
DURINGJJOVEMBER
THIS WILL GIVE EACH MEMBER
OF FAMILY THREE POUNDS
OF SUGAR FOR USE BUT HONOR
CARD SYSTEM REMAINS IN
VOGUE, ALSO
Deputy County Food Administrator
E. C. Campbell received Instructions
from food administration headquar
ters to increase the allotment of su.Jiar
for families by 50 per cent during
the month of November. This will
give each person an allowance cf
three pounds per montn instead of
two, as heretofore. Under this plan
boarding houses and r?staurants will
be allowed the same increase.
Everybody admits that it is pos
sible to manage on two pounds of
sugar per month, and the increased
allotment by the food administration
provides a very liberal per capita al
lowance. Dealers will now be permitted to
sell families two weeks' or a half
month's supply instead of one week'8
supply.
There have been a few flagrant
cases of violation of the honor sys
tem as regards sugar sales, and It is
to- be hoped that with the liberal in
crease in allowance consumers will
not attempt to take advantage of the
situation.
The restrictions imposed by the
honor certificates are still in force.
In explaining to the consuming
public the increased allotment of
sugar the food administration states
that transportation conditions have
improved and provided the railroads
greater ability for the handling of in
ternal transportation.
The restriction imposed on soft
Jrir.k businesses, candy manufactur
ers and bakers still remain In force,
and no additional allotments are made
to any of these classes.

CAMPBELL AWARE
OF INTENTION
TO ATTACK HIM
Declares That He Is Willing
for His Haywood Corres
pondence to Be Used if It
Is Used in Full
(Special to The Review)
DOUGLAS. Ariz., Oct. 31. Tom
Campbell, candidate for governor,
wha has been touring southern Ari
zona, accompanied by Prof. H. E.
Matthews, state supsrintendent of
schools, and J. G. Compton, nominee
for corporation commissioner, has
been receiving splendid m -eptions in
every county visited. While not per
mitted to hold meetings the party is
meeting large numbers of voters.
Governor Campbell started out at
Flcrsnce. going from there to Casa
Grande and then Yuma, .jo. Tucson,
Nogales, Patagonia, Benson, Tomb
stone aa d LUbeu. Frcin Douglas
they left by automobile for a trip
through the Sulphur Springs valley
to Willcox and Gila valley.
Prof. Mathews already had a wlda
acquaintance through the stateand
is making many new friends. " Mr.
Compton is making a fine impression
everywhere he goes.
Before leaving Douglas, Governor
Campbell wan informed that his op
ponents are planning an eleventh-honr
attack in the form of advertising a
letter whicTi he wrote to W. D. Hay
wcod. following the Bisbee deporta
tions. The letter has already been
published in a Phoenix weekly which
is supporting Colter, and was written
by Campbell, as governor, in reply to
a telegram. Governor i ampbell said
that he had no objection to the pub
lication of the letter if the whole
correspondence Is given, as it is self
explanatory and merely confirms what
he has always maintained was his
attitude as governor in the case of
the deportations.
Governor Campbell was met at
Douglas by Judge Sames, state chair
man of the republican party, who has
just returned from a trip te every
ceunty of the state. He is confident
that Campbell will be elected by a
majority of at least 5,000.

NOTICE
Two years ago the people of this
county laid aside all political consid
eration to give me the office of county
school superintendent. In return I
have given the best service of which
I have been capable. That has meant
spending most of my time and energy
upon the little country schools which
at best work under great handicaps.
Above everything else I have used this
office to give the rural children a
part in every possible war activity, as
a privilege that will make them mere
intelligent American citizens.
Beyond making this statement, I
shall do no campaigning. The work
of. this office has so increased since
the war. that I should have to neglect
it were I to take time 'for such purely
personal business.
