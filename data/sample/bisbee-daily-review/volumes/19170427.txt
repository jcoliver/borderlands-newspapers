NEW YORK, April 26. With Maj
or General G. T. M. Bridges of the
British war commission as their guest
of honor the members of the Ameri
can Newspaper Publishers' Associa
tion, at their annual dinner here to
night, proclaimed their confidence in
the future of the United States and
her allies, and pledged anew their
patriotic devotion to the nation.
Joffre Greatest Hero
General Bridges, who told with
pride 'of having fought under Marshal
Joffre at the Marne, was given an en
thusiastic welcome.
"He is the man cf whom it may be
said that he saved the civilized world
at the battle of the Marne," said the
soldier of England In his tribute to
the great French commander.
Speaking as the representative of
Mr. Balfour, General Bridges brought
with him to the dinner something of
the spirit of the battlefields of France
and Belgium. He' was able to tell
from his personal experiences some
thing of the scourge of Belgium at the
beginning of the war. It was not the
work of undisciplined soldiers, he de
clared, but was the deliberate plan of
the highest German army authorities.
. Patriotism was the dominant note
of the dinner from the decorations to
the speeches. The invocation was a
plea that the strength of the nation
be devoted to "humanity's holy
cause." and Job E. Hedges, the toast
master, proposed a composite toast,
to the President, the King of England
and the President of France.

WASHINGTON, April 26. Pre
liminary report of the treasury
department, upon which Secreta
ry McAdoo will base his recom
mendatons to the President as to
he size of the first bond issue
under the $7,000,000,000 finance
law, indicate that the United
States will be called upon to fin
ance the allies to the extent of at
least $400,000,000 and possibly
$500,000,000 a month.
N The tentative program also
calls for the expenditure of vir
tually every dollar of the borrow
ed money in this country for food
Stuffs, munit'ons, coal, clothing,
railway equipment and other sup
plies. The estimates still incomplete and
subject to revision, indicate the fol
lowing entente needs:
Britain Needs Most
For Great Britain $200,000,000 to
$500,000,000 a month: for France.
from $100,000,000 to $125,600,000; for
Russia a sum undetermined, but up
to $100,000,000 a month, depending
largely upon the ability of manufac
turing plants in this country to meet
her demands, mostly for supplies oth
er than foodstuffs and munitions; for
Italy about $50,000,000 a month.
Must Vote More By Fall
Should these requirements be met
in their entirety, the $3,000,000,000
available for lending the allies would
be exhausted in from six to seven and
one-hair months.
It is likely, however, that the pre
liminary estimates can be pared down
to a point where, without omitting
essentials, the huge loan could be
made to cover requirements for a
much longer time, possibly for one
year.
Secretary McAdoo and his assist
ants devoted today almost wholly to
a study of entente financial needs.
Billion Needed By July
Indications were not lacking that
Mr. McAdoo would consider favorab
ly the suggestion that he offer soon
another block of treasury certificates

ond offering it was said, probably

$250,000,000 and might be offered
within ten days. Should the govern

the extent of $500,000,000 a month,
approximately $1,000,000,000 would be
needed to meet requirements prior to
June 30, the date upon which the
first proceeds of the bond issue prob

! JUAREZ. April 26. If the United
: States expects Mexico to prevent Cer-
ns from menacing the American
border, as General Carranza has
agreed to do, then the American gov-
I eminent should suppress the Villa
I juntas that exist in American border
cities and should drive these Villa
propagandists from the border, Gen
!eral Francisco Murguia, commander
Mn chief of the northeastern military
lione, said, tonight before leaving for
Casas Grandes in pursuit of Villa,
j RaPs U. S. Made Plots
i "We are now fighting a common en
jemy of the United States and Mexico
;in Francisco Villa." General Murguia
said. "We fight to prevent him from
approaching the American border, yet
just across the same border. Villa
agents and Villa juntas are permitted
to operate more or less openly, there
by aiding and abetUng a man who is
not a Mexican, but an international
criminal whose bloody motives are
directed as much against the United
States and the American people as
they are against Mexico and the Mex
ican people."
General Murguia said this as he sat
in the private car of bis troop train,
smoking a black cigarette, a bandana
handkerchief tied about his neck in
place of n collar and his service uni
form soiled with the dust of the des
ert. "At this time, when the military
and civil authorities of Mexico are
doing everything possible to eliminate
Villa." lie added. "I believe the Unit
ed States government would be doing
a real service, both to the United
States and Mexico, if these Villa con
spiracies were suppressed and the
conspirators arrested. Many border
towns contain nests of radicals who
are permitted to connive against the
established government of Mexico
which has been recognized as such by
the United States.
Keeps Villa From Border
"The purpose of my present cam
paign has been to prevent Villa from
reaching the American frontier and
to give battle to him wherever I could
locate him. Tonight we are bound for
Casas Grandes to prevent Villa reach
ing a point where another raid across
the American border would be possi
ble. That was the reason for my cam
paign from Casas Grandes and I be
lieve it has been successful for we
have scattered Villa's followers and
forced him to disorganize his com
mand into small roving bands of ban
dits. (Continued on Page Six)
House
posed It. Senator Stone who conclud
ed the day's debate in the senate de
clared that although he opposed the
declaration of war, be would vote with
the President for conscription. He
said be believed, however, the bill
should be changed to make ages of
those subject to draft 25 to 40 instead
jf 19 to 45 and that it should contain
a provision that the President when
peace Is declared must give up his
authority to raise an army under it.
Draft Assures Success
"We are needed on the battle line
in Europe." the Missouri senator said.
I "Thr must ho nn halting at home.
The President thinks the time is past
for experiment. I agree with him. It
is imperative that we act and get
ready with the least possible delay.
The draft plan will most certainly,
speedily and efficiently meet the de
mands of the hour. Pass this bill and
he will forthwith enter upon a plan
that will not be experimental: Its suc
cess is assured from the beginning."

predicted in the senate that it
may be necessary for the Un

men before victory is won.
"A war cd paper ami of dol
lais only would be a disgrace
and make America a by-word

he said. "I believe the Ger
man kaiser would rather blow
the world into smithereens
than see defeat."
Representatives Osborn of
California, a Union volunteer
in the Civil War, supporting
the administration's plans, eu
logized the President and sug
gested that if he should deem
it wise to accept the services
of Colonel Roosevelt to raise a
division for service in France,
it would be a glorious inspira
tion to the American people,
without compromise to the
principles of the conscription
bill.

asking him to desist from his agita

"I do not believe any one questions
your patriotism or your Americanism
in the present crisis." said the mes
sage. "Yet I regret that in your ef
forts to put our flag on the firing line
at the head of a force of volunteers
you are giving aid and comfort to the

to the principle of universal obliga

WASHINGTON Anril Rr
the veteran naval officer of Great
Britain's war commission to the Un
ited States gave Washington news
paper correspondents today a first
hand story of some of his experiences
during the two years he commanded
a patrol fleet chasing German sub
maiines. Without minimizing the
gravity of the submarine menace he
confidently predicted that it would be
overcome.
Doubts Attack on U. S. .
Commenting cn suggestions that
Germany might undertake a submar
ine campaign on the American roast,
the admiral said this would not be
profitable from the German point of
view without extensive bases on this
side of the Atlantic.
The admiral spoke on the memorial
lessons the allies had learned in the
war and said He and bis colleagues
had come to place them at the dispos
al of the American government.
Fa'ed U-Boats Unnumbered
"I only wish." he said, "that I could
tell you the number of German sub
! marines that we have sunk. Unfortu-
'nately, that is a naval secret as also
marines and of combatting them,
which it will be necessary to guard in
closest secrecy until the end of the
war. Your navy has betn furnished
with full details, however, by the
present mission."
Of the prospect of submarine ap
pearing in American waters .-tdmiral
de Chair said:
"It wculd not pay Germany to In
augurate a general submarine cam
paign off the American coast unles
she could also establish bases here.
Each submarine carries frum eisht to

supply, which would largely be wast
ed in the long trip over and back, not
to mention the warm reeption sh
would probably receive.

"Nobody knows exactly how many
submarines the Germans are building
but we know they are working at fev

that they are turning out from two to

tion is about eight months, with a

GREEK PATRIOTS IN
AMERICA URGED TO
REGISTER IN N. Y.
Venizelos Party Men of Coch
ise County Asked To Place
Services At Disposal of U.
S. Government
The following patriotic message was
sounded in the National Herald, a
New York paper devoted to the Greeks
of Venizelos in this country, and trans
lated by M. E., a Cretan, for the Re
view. The call is for the male Greeks
in this country, of whom there are
ab'jut 450,000. two-thirds of whom are
said to support Zenizelos, to register
at the New York address given below,
to offer their services to this country.
Whether the plan of assembling these
men as proposed in the call is under
war department orders or not is no
known. The need of having these men
serve together, many knowing only
their native tongue, is patent. What
method planned for officering them
also is not known, although a plan is
suggested in the article, which fol
lows: The Greeks of America, and espe
cially of New York, must understand
that briefly they will be called, in or
der to offer the tax of their blood t"Jr
the conflict of the United States, which
is in a general war and for the Greece
of Venizelos. against Germany and
her allies, and they must understand
that to offerHheir services for this
general war under the Starry Flag, of
their second country, they will organ
ize independent military units, purely
with Greek officers. Experienced
Greek officers and n'jn-conunissioned
officers of the Greek army will retake
the setting, the command of those
units and will direct once more to the
honor and glory, the young Greeks of
America.
The duty of this military organiza
tion has been undertaken by the I'nion
of the Greek Liberalists with zeal, de
sire, and secrecy, indeed, admirable
and wonderful work has been contrib
uted so far. All the indispensable ele
ments for such military organization
has been founded with care, diligence
and selection from specific men of a
military service, from veteran soldiers
of the two Balkan wars, and officers
with known experience and activity.
The work is going on seriously and un
disturbed, in pro.'jrtion to its great
importance and its higher national
sense.
Such designs will not be obtained
with uproar, but with systematical
studying and positive work.
So. the Greek Liberalists of America
who are wishing to serve in this gen
eral American war of the allies and
Greece who are many may hurry on
to matriculate in the list of the Liber
alist union and give their addresses,
and to be ready i'Jr the acquaintance
of invitation which they are going to
receive briefly. And to have in view
that they will serve with Greek com
panies under Greek officers.
Forward Then
Appear to the Club of the Liberal
ists to be enrolled:

DRAFT ARMY VITAL
DECLARES GERARD
(Continued From rage One)
chief speaker after General Bridges,
made an impassioned appeal for uni
versal military service. It is the on
ly thing which can save the nation
from Prussian militarism, he declar
ed. He called upon every publisher
present to send a telegram to his pap
er directing that it come out flatly for
the administration bill and support it
by every means in his power. By so
doing, hesaid. "you gentlemen will
break a lance for the cause of free
dom. We can't go into tiiis war with
velvet gloves. We have got to have
this bill."
Germany is from 100 to 20' years
behind the times in liberty and dem
ocracy. Mr. Gerard asserted. "There
may be riots there," he said, "but
there will be no revolution."
To a certain extent, the former am
bassador asserted, the entrance of the
I'nited States into the war due to
misrepresentation of American senti
ment in Germany and German senti
ment in America by American news
paper men of pro-German sympathies
who were stationed in Berlin. He
paid high tribute, however, to Sey
mour B. Conger, of the Associated
Press and Carl W. Ackerman. They
were true Americans, he said.
"The worst enemies in this coun
try today." Mr. Gerard declared, "are
the insidious enemies here at home
who misrepresent facts."
Mr. Gerard arraigned Speaker
Champ Clark for his advocacy of the
volunteer system. He said he had sup
ported Mr. Clark in his campaign for
the Democratic presidential nomina
tion in 1911.
"But thank heaven." he exclaimed,
"some benificent Providence which
keeps the American people from put
ting forward their near-statesmen, in
tervened." Referring to Germany's military am
bitions before the war, Mr. Gerard
said Admiral von Tirpitz had openly
advocated the seizure of the coast of
Flanders as a base for operations
against England and the ven Tirpitz
party now is in the ascendency. Ik
said. Germans of all types, Mr. Ger
ard explained, advocated bringing
England to her knees, seizing her na
vy and using British warships to op
erate against the United States, there
by forcing this country to pay all the
expense of the conflict.
He placed einhpasis on the Russian
situation and asserted that if Russic
withdraws from the war or if it act:,
ineffectively the United States will
be brought face to face with German
autocracy.
Major General Bridges declared the
soldiers of England and France wouh'
like to see the Stars and Stripes fly
ing beside the Tri-color and the Un
ion Jack upon the field of battle.
Major General Leonard Wood, who
spoke briefly, said he hoped sooner or
later to be . serving with Genera'
Bridges on the French front.
Other speakers were X. K. Rowell.

payment of these officers, 10,000 of whom are expected to
be ready for assignment to duty by the middle of July,
only men who are rich enough to support themselves and
those who are dependent on them out of their private
means will be able to report at the training camps. Thus
the first assignment of officers' posts will be to a class
of men who are not compelled to work for their living.
A surer way to perpetuate the idea of caste in the army,
which has lately been the subject of so much harsh com
ment, could not be imagined.
"It is difficult to comment on this amazing statement
of the Adjutant General with patience. It seems that
it must be another example of the traditional bungling in
the Washington bureaus. Billions have been readily
voted for the payment of war expenses. The men who
are to serve the country must be paid. There is not a
single decent citizen who will not resent the idea that
we are to select officers from among men who can afford
to give all their time for three months for not a dollar
of pay. Yet these men are asked to sign a paper waiving
payment for their service. There are many such men
who are willing to accept officers' commissions if they are
found competent to receive them. But they are not anx
ious to become part of a military aristocracy. They are
all advocates of universal service. That is the principle
fcr which the President no stands. What becomes of
the principle when the officerships are to be limited to
rich men? The Adjutant General's sad. mistake, which
has already created mischief enough, must be corrected
without delay by Congress or the War Department, or
both."
When the war is over, laddies, just
take a tip from me.
There'll be no German submarines a
diving through the sea.
For in Fatherland is Kaiser Bill, the
guy we're going to lick.
We will have a brand new Kaiser, and
the same will be a Mick.
We'll change the song, "Der Wach am
Rhein" into an Irish reel.
And make the Dutchman dance it, if
s'o inclined we feel.
For the police force in Berlin will be
Micks from the County Clare,
When we put an Irish Kaiser in the

Shure, in every Gorman parkway you

No liverwurst or .)usage lun the

But he'll get corned beef and cabbage

nation, asked of a Phcemx patriotic assemblage last j
week why the young men of Arizona were not joining j Tile f"i;Uo r : -!;'rn" proved conclusively the
the ranks of the First Arizona infantry; why the men ! f fS''"'"-v f ';,! volyntcr system hi modern war.
eligible to this organization were apathetic, although by j
reason of its presense in the field, upon the line of duty
on the Mexican border, the First Arizona extends parti
cular opportunity to its members for participation in
first engagements and for advancement.
Governor Campbell declared there must be some vital
reason for this apathy. Very frankly he called upon the
public to tell him why if it knew. He said he wanted
to know, and that once informed he gave his promise that
there would be correction. He made his appeal personpl,
virile, with the declaration that tiie attitude of which
he spoke caused the feeling at heart that perhaps the
fault was within himself.
Captain John C. Greenway, following the governcr
with an address which, in association with that of ti.e
chief executive of the state and others, mads the occa
sion notable, told the governor that a part of the apathy
must be charged to the fact that the young men of Am
erica hesitated only in keeping with the measured step
at Washington; that whenever Washington completed its
plans and made announcement of these in full, with at
tendance of the assurance that the time of action was at
hand, then there would no longer be apathy among the
young men, but in its stead a mighty charge to the
colors.
Captain Greenway covered the cause in part. Accept
ing in good faith the appeal of Governor Campbell for
light, an appeal that we honor for its frank bravery, we
extend here our opinion as to the main reason why th
ranks of the First Arizona do not fill
Adjutant General Harris!
Until that stable is cleaned, until the smirch which has
deepened upon Arizona military cloth throughout th.i
Harris regime, first by one means and then another and
others, all, let us grant, attributable to the occupatio-i
by a basically good man of a position for which he has no
fitness, no efficiency until this is wiped out there can be
no enthusiasm created, no enlistment fervor aroused for
the First Arizona.
There is our answer to your request. Governor Camp
bell, given in no spirit of unkindness to the "adjutant gen
eral, but uttered, as we conceive it, in the manner of a

severe trial. In the same spirit, we go a step further:
Get rid cf Harris. Arizona Gazette.
"FOR RICH MEN ONLY."
Bisbee and the Warren District has among its people
a number of men who would be aspirants for the officers
reserve corps of the United States army, if the proper
conditions obtained . Many of these men are without any
other means of support than the salary they may he re
ceiving from their employers. Consequently, the action
of the adjutant general in deciding that aspirants for
the officers reserve corps should not receive payment for
their services while training has dampened II. e (iiihtii
iasm of many. This is not due to a lack of patriotism
nor to a sordid interest in becoming officers. Many of
the local men have dependents and must have the means
of taking care of them. Some method of payment by
the government must be devised whereby this cause for
complaint can be eliminated.
The New York Times, under the heading at the head
of this editorial, printed an editorial which is very much
to the point. It is to be hoped that the war deparement
and congress may see the light. The editorial, in ques
tion, follows:
"The Adjutant General's announcement t hat the re
serve officers and candidates for officers' commissions
who are summoned to enter the training camps niurt
serve their country without pay is most astonishing, it is
discouraging. Money is one of the few tilings not lacking
in our war preparations. The statement that no pro
vision has been made to pay the reserve officers while
they are training in therefore amazing. It was surely
never the purpose of either Congress or the Administra
tion to enforce military service on any men without pay.

British army cot Id not advance as fast as the French
armies. While tl e French conscripts nailed their oppo.n

frightened flank, the British volunteers were still plodding
wearily from the rear.
Free from enemies in front. Von Kluck was able to
mass his entire army against Gallieni and throw back the
flank movement. This caused Gen. Joffre's magnificent
plan to miscarry, and it was only througli a brilliant
move of Gen. Foch with reinforcements of hastily armed
civilians previously trained through the system of uni
versal service that victory was achieved.
The almost fatal failure of the British army was
through no fault of its generals or lack of bravery in the
men, but was due to the volunteer system whereby men
of middle age marched in the ranks with men in th;
prime of youth. The French armies and the German
armies were composed bnly of men in the prime of youth.
Gen. Joffre moved the French armies with the speed
of hardly young men. The older British soldiers could
not keep this pace and the younger British soldiers were

In our volunteer armies, in our regular army, and in
our national guard we have the Fame fatal fault. W

The young men win be held back to the speed of th
old men. Our troops will not be able to maneuver as

Until nearly the last hour of trad

weather involving additional delay
and curtailment of spring wheat seed

Big Doin's Tonight
At Hi Auditorium
If the carnival and the dance at the
high school auditorium tonight does
not prove to be the best evening's en
tertainment ever offered at the school
more than 200 Bisbr-e boys and girls
will miss tlteir guess. To remind the
public of the carnival, the high school
kids are going to stage a parade at
5:30 o'cli ck this evening, headed by
the famous hi band. The doors of
the auditorium will be thrown open
at six o'clock and the fun will last as
long as anyone stays to enjoy it
Each class has something special to
offer. The seniors boast that their
"Mirrorsct pe Show" will prove the
big attraction: the junior class will
offer a "Chamber of Horrors" guar
anteed to scare the modest reserved
out of his wits; the sophomore
"Grape Juice Girls," and "Mystery
Booth" are highly recommended and
the freshie will offer fortune telling
and a flag and flower booth. In addi
tion, there will be booths of every
kind, where anything from "hot dogs"

AMERICA," DECLARES
CHAUTAUQUA OFFICER
Ellison-White Representative
Is Loud In Praise of Energy
Displayed By Local Chau
tauqua Guarantee Commit
tee. '
Last year 27 public spirited citizens
sisned a contract with the big Ellison
White Chautauqua pystem, agreeing
to sell 700 season tickets at the re
duced price of $2.50 each, in order
that Risbee might be placed on the
Chautauqua circuit.
This committee has made good, or
nearly so hut. that no one may be
disappointed. 100 extra tickets have
been provided at the same price. They
will probably not meet the. demand,
and no adult season tickets will he
sold after noon of opening day at less
than $3.00.
The Chautauqua will open Sunday
evening at 7: SO o'clock. Come early
so as to secure your reserved seats.
About 300 comfortable chairs have
been reserved at five cents for each
performance. '
C. A. Matteson, business manager
for the Chautauqua, said last night:
"I wish to say at this time that I
can see no reason why Risbee's first
Chautauqua should not he a huge suc
cess. Through the columns of the
Bisbee Daily Review. I want to per
sonally thank the people of the War
ren District for their very courteous
treatment, and hearty cooperation. I
am sure you will go on and on doing
the things worth while. Your schools
are excellent, your city is clean, and
your Y. M. V. A. and Y. W. C. A. is
a revelation to me. I travel in thir
teen states, and I do not know of a
single city twice the size of Bisbee
that has accomplished through its Y.
M. C. A. what you have right here in
Risbee.
"I have the feeling that the people
of other states should know what you
are doing and so far as I am able. I
shall be glad to tell them the story of
the cleanest mining camp in Ameri
ca." LAURIUM AND PREPAREDNESS
The silver mines of Laurium in
Greece had been operated for many
centuries with varying fortunes. In
the time of Theniistocles, in the fifth
century B. C. the production of sil
ver from these mines had fallen to
nearly nothing. By his order the reg
ion was examined by a commission,
on which the elder Xenophon was the
leading spirit. As a result the mines
were nationalized and a leasing sys
tem under rigid requirements as to
continuous operation, was establish
ed. The State exercised close sur
veillance over the work, and facilitat
ed the treatment of the ores and the
refining of the output. This syste
matic effort led to such an enorm
ous yield of silver that the profits
excited the cupidity of the Athen
ians. A proposal was made by the
chief men of the Athenian oligarchy
to divide the proceeds among the clt-

Forsees Villa's Doom
"Without fixing the time. I am con
fident that our present method of
campaigning peainst Villa will be suc
cessful and we will either capture ,r
kill Villa and his leaders and forever
end the reign of Villa terror in the
r.orth."
Would Put Him in Circus
Asked what he would do with Villa
should he succeed in capturing him
j.live. General Muruuia laughed and
said, jokingly, he would loan him to
an American cirrus to be exhibited
in a cage throughout the country.
"You Americans have an express
ion: 'Catch the bear before cooking
him.' This applies to Villa." he said.
Denies Has Germans
General Murguia reiterated his de
nial that he had any German orticers
in his command, adding that he had
neither Germans. Americans, Chinese
or other aliens among his forces ex
cept his Chinese cook. He also denies
his intention of going to Mexico City
for a conference with General Obre
gon. saying he would remain with his
troops until Villa wxs captured or
killed.
General Murguia exhibited a silver
mounted saddle which was found in
the hacienda house at San Miguel de
Babicora and which was identified by
one of the Villa prisoners as belong
ing to Villa himself. The saddle will
he sent to Mexico City for exhibition
there. He also gave details of Villa's
escape at Babicora. told how Villa es
caped on an unsaddled horse in his
underclothes. after his "aolden
guards" hf.d been killed and his pri
vate secretary captured. Among the
papers found in possession of the sec
retary was a letter from a Villa parti
san in the I'nited States informing
Villa that four hundred thousand
workingnien in the I'nited States
were ready to join him in his revolu
tion. Murguia said. Other important
documents were also taken from the
saddle bags of Villa's saddle.
General MurcuH's train left at dark
tonight for Casas Grandes. the last of
eiuht troop trains which arrived from
Moctezuina today. A work train was
sent ahead of the troop trains to re
pair a number of bridges which were
burned bv Villa bands last night.

(Continued From Pae One)
Unauthorized to Talk
To the second question M. Viviani
?.ave his approval of a statement made
by his assistant that no members of
the commission had been authorized
to speak fi.r themselves or the com
mission; ths:t tiny-thing regarding the
intention of the mission which had
pppeared in the newspapers did not
bear the stamp of official authoriza
tion and that, as the mission had,
placed itself at the disposal of Presi
dent. Wilson, any statement about the ,
progress of the negotiations or other
matters connected with the stay of
the mission in this country must
come from American officials.
Dsy a Busy One
The mission spent a busy day with
a call on Secretary Lansing. To ap
plause from assembled officials and
':o cinment clerks, the members of
the mission and their staffs filed thru i
the corridors of the state department
shortly after 11 o'clock. They re
mained with Secretary Lansing five
minutes and went to the White House I
where they were received by Presi- j
dent Wilson in the Blue Room. M.
Viviani presented to the President a ;
letter from President Poincaire in !
which the great friendship existing J
fcetween the two republics was em- j
nhr sized. The President, through an
interpreter, expressed his apprecia
tion. Navy Chiefs Meet
When the party left the White
House Marshal Joffre returned to the
war department to call on Secretary
Baker; Admiral Chocheprat went to
the navy department to call upon Sec
retary Daniels, and M. Viviani to. the
Capitol to call upon Vice President
Marshall.
Senate Invites Viviani
Mr. Marshall extended a tentative
invitation to the head of the mission
'o appear on the floor of the senate.
! was later indicated that M. Viviani
had accepted and that he probably
would go to the senate either cn Sat
urday or Monday to be presented and
nerhaps make some informal remarks
Conferences Are On
In the afternoon preliminary con
ferences between the American and
French technical experts were begun
nd callers began to arrive at the
White home to . visit the principal
members of the mission. Attorney
f?neral Gregory was among them.
Conferences will be continued to
morrow. Admiral Chocheprat, repre
senting the French navy, will see Ad
miral Benson, chief of operations, at
10:30 a. m. At 3:30 o'clock in the af
ternoon Marshall Joffre. accompanied
by his staff, will go to the army war
ct liege and at the same time Admiral
Chocheprat will visit the navy yard.
n hour later M. Viviani will visit the
United States Supreme Court. Tomor
row night the entire party will attend
i dinner at the French embassy.
Many Subjects Covered
All during the day there will be
many conferences between American
and French experts on military, nav
al, financial and commercial ques
tions. Several members of the mis
sion are most anxious to visit some
f the larger American cities and
some of the historic spots connected
with American history.
Tonight the chiefs of the mission
were entertained at a dinner at the
White House and later the entire par
ty attended a reception there. A large
number of officials and other persons
prominent in the official life of Wash
ington greeted the distinguished
Frenchmen.
At Dinner Pary
Among those present at the dinner
the men on day shift will have plenty
of time to attend.
