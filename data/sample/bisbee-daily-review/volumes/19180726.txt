UNDATED WAR LEAD, BY
THE ASSOCIATED PRESS.
General Foch has taken a leaf out
of the book of German military
strategy and orc'ained the use by
the allied armies of the pincer sys
tem of offensive in the Soissons,
Rheims salient.
Both jaws of the pincer are
moving smoothly, with the pivot
along the Marne working in uni
son, and the process of attempt
infi to capture many of the nearly
half a million Germans in the big
pocket is well on the way to what
at present seems like a success
ful operation.
The Germans, however, evidently
do not intend to permit themselves to
be entrapped without fighting. Having
thrown thousands of reinforcements
into the already congested salient,
they have started a counter attack of
great violence all along the semi-cir-rular
front from the Ourcq river to
the region immediately southwest of
Rheims and their men are said to j
have orders to stem the allied tide of
advance at all costs.
Nevertheless, at last accounts the
Americans, French, British and Italian
troops, themselves well reinforced to
meet the new turn in affairs, were
steadily pressing forward at nearly all
points on the battle line to Rhjeirus
while east of the Cathedral city a Po
lish contingent, the first of the Poles
to enter the combat, is declared to
have carried out successfully an en
terprise against the enemy in which
more than 200 Germans were made
prisoner.
The western jaw of the pincer con
tinues to move eastward on both sides
of the Ourcq river, and the Franco
American troops are virtually knock
ing at the gates of Fere-En-Tardenois,
the important railway junction ana
storehouse for Germany's war sup
plies. Further south to the Marne
new advances, in keeping with those
in the north, have been attained.
At the pivot of the pincer, north of
the Marne mid-way between Chateau
Thierry and Rheims, the French have
extended their line northward in the
forest of Fere, in the Ris Foerst and
north of Dormans, while the eastern
jaw of the pincer, under the pressure
of the British has noticeably moved
forward in a northwesterly direction
for about a mile and a half over a
three mile front to Mery-Premecy and
Gueux, the last named village five
miles west of Rheims and a scant mile
and a half from the Rheims-Fismes
road. At Mery-Premecy the allied line
now stands about ten and a half miles
southeast of Fismes, which is the cen
tral station on the railway running be
tween Soissons and Rheims.
For a week and a day the allied
troops have hammered against the
Soissons-Rheims salient until its width
across between the cities has been
narrowed to about twenty-one miles
from an original width of thirty-seven
miles, while the triangular salient has
been welded into a semi-circular cul
de sac. Over the entire pocket the al
lied artillery continues to rain shells
from all sides and airmen are keeping
up their intensive bombing of troop
formations and military works.
As yet, notwithstanding the inroads
of the allied troops, there has been
no sign of an impending general re-

Secretary Baker Has Heard
Nothing Confirming Sweep
ing Victory; Reports Thrill
ing Capital
WASHINGTON', July '-5. With
American, French and British
forces pressing the enemy hard on
all sides of the Aisne-Marne battle
front, the air of Washington was
electric tonight with a feeling of
expectancy as of great events im
pending. Rumors of decisive vic
tory ran through official circles like
wild fire. Untraceable reports were
current that the army of the Ger
man crown prince had been trapped
and even that the crown prince
himself had been captured.
Official reports gave no foundation
on which the feeling of suppressed ex
citement could be based.
"The latest dispatches," said Secre
tary Baker, "show continued advances
in several places by French, British
and American troops. They are not
extensive, but are important and show
that the battle is continuing with great
vigor."
Earlier in the day a press dispatch
told of rumors in London that the Brit
ish west of Rheims had scored a de
cided success and advanced toward
F5smes. the German rail base midway
between Soissons and Rheims. Later
reports confirmed this to the extent
!f a stride forward by British and
' French forces on a three-mile front
just west of Rheims, throwing the en
emy back a mile ana a nan. rroo
ably it was this which started wild
reports of a sweeping victory.
Still later came news of decided
gains by Franco-American troops
around Fere-En-Tardenois and north
of Dormans on the Marne. It was
evident that the southern and south
western angle of the German position
were yielding to the pressure against
them. News came also of importnt
advances along the Ourcq front.
The outstanding fact tonight ap
peared to be that the enemy's front
was being forced back all along the
sixiy-mile battle line. Of the gains re
corded, the Franco-British drive prob
ably has the greatest possibilities for

GENERALISSDIO OF
ALLIES' OFFENSIVE
' General l".v!:nand I"o:h.
This is a new photograph of Gen
eral Ferdinand Foch, the man in com
plete control of the allied armies in
Europe, and the man whose strategy
has halted the Germans in four drives
and now has enabled the allies to halt
the fif'h drive and hurl the Huns back.
This allied offensive is somewhat simi
lar to the one struck by General Joffre
in 1914. Foch's main line of action
seems to be to let the enemy waste
manpower, ammunition and supplies in
a drive and then cal! a halt and when
the right time comes carry the enemy
off his feet with a counter drive.
IN MUNITION
Grew Out of Effort of Gov -

of Skilled Labor Between
Flants
(By Review I.easeJ Wire)
LONDON (via Ottawa), July 25
The strike had its origin In the defi
ciency of skilled labor. This deficiency
necessitated the government making
plans for an even distribution of labor
but some firms, by offering attractive
wages, managed to secure an unfair
proportion pt skilled workers. The
government therefore laid an embargo
on three Coventry firms, which were
told an excess of skilled hands could
not he permitted.
It is said fie men misunderstood the
purport of the embargo which was
wrongly interpreted as an attempt to
oust skilled workers and drive them
into the army by means of low wages.
Aside from this the men contend the
embargo is a restriction of their right
to dispose of their labor on the best
terms obtainable.

' munitions announced tonight that it

Birmingham joint committee, repeat
ing the previous offer to recommend

(By the Associated Press.) With th

coming steadily closer together, the
German crown prince's generals ar-
driving their men mercilessly in an
effort to hold them off long enouch to
extricate the armies threatened at tb

allied successes.
The Americans have occupied Cour

and the French positions have
beeu advanced until Oulchy-Le-t"h.-teau

Near Soissons the Germans failed to
hold all their positions, notwithstand
ing reinforcements and their desperate

It is estimated unofficially tonight
that the enemy losses are more than
20ii,0')o of which 50.00 were inflicte l
by the Americans. The prisoner

losses In dead and wounded are appall

than usual, and cavalry or mounted
patrols were effectively employed in
'clearing the forests and maintaining
contact.
Toward Soissons there has been in
creased artillery work and bitterr
and steadier fighting. The French and
American soldiers disregarded caution
almost entirely yesterday, advancing
their lilies in open order and taking
what came without bothering to hunt
down machine gun nests. This brought
them into closer contact with the mam

On the west side of the pocket the
France-American troops have straightened-
out their line at the expense of
the Germans during the past twenty-
tour hours, this involving a loss to the
enemy of about forty square miles oi
territory between Armentieres and
Vincelles. The line in the lower part

east from Armentieres and along this

to give up all the little angles and

nipi untenable. In fact, no place in
the whole pocket is a very comfort
able position wiih the allied long range
artillery sweeping back and forth.
Possible evidence of a further witn
drawal by the Germans Is seen on the.
western flank of ihe pocket in the
fret that German artillery fire has

jetted to occasional shells, both shrap
nel and gas, though without damage.
Behind the lines long transports cf
allied troops fill the roads leading to
the front, the affied planes and observ
ing balloons giving warning against
interference by enemy artillery or hos
tile aircraft. The American troops botn
on the line and on the roads are keen
spirited. Many of them have learned
a smattering of French, often yell 10
the French marching by amusing com
ments on "the big show."
Invariably the French reply, usually
in language which the Americans do
not understand, although thev slmiK
their approval no matter what the
words may mean. The Americans also
undertake conversation with the Ana
iuite8, whose countenances rarely
change and who never attempt to re
ply. Intermingled in the line of battle
and along the roads are white, black
and yellow races in all the units and
the big machine is moving without a
knock or lost motion. Now and then
the color scheme to the rear of the
fighting lines is broken by a column
of gray clad prisoners, whose appear
ance is always quickly noticed by the
troops who are more accustomed to
the khaki uniforms and the blue o,
the French. In scores of cases pris
oners have begged their guards to tell
them when they are to be shot. The
majority of them, however, stolidly ac
cept wnat they believe to be their fate.
Back of the lines there are dressing
stations and fixed hospitals, and the
American wounded are cared for expe
ditiously ana skillfully, in a manner re
flecting the qualities of veteranship
now belonging to the American estab
lishments in France. American doctors
and nurses, men and women, are worth
ing night and day to relieve pain and
restore injured members. To them
young men representing almost every
state in the union and occasionally a
1-rench or British soldier, are huiriet:
to be cared for until they could be
transferred elsewhere.
The same spirit of co-operation is
displayed in all the hospitals of the al
lies. But the number of wounded is
not so great as might be expected
from the magnitude of the operations.
Y. M. C. A. men are also close on the
heels of the advancing Americans. One
outtit appeared at Jaulgonne early in
the morning .with, cigarettes, candy
and other delicacies to be disposed 01
in their canteens. The guns were roar
ing on all sides, but Jaulgonne, it was
announced, had been captured, and the
1 M. C. A. took charge. The command
ing officer ordered the Y. M. C. A. men
out, explaining not only that it was
too hot, but that the men would gath
er wherever they were and German
shells had a habit of going where the
German observers spotted crowds.

telegraphed Wednesday, after relating
the incident surrounding the capture

"The Germans apparently are fight

"The Americans captured lare
quantities of ammunition. The Ameri

two ho :rs today."
The same correspondent, telcgrapn

"More progress is reported in the
Fere and Ris forests where the French

tenacious resistance, in which their

through submarine sinkings off our At
lantic coast.
In asking tho public voluntarily to
reduce their consumption to a level
more nearly equal to the compulsory
restrictions in effect in France, Eng
land and Italy, the statement says that
while sugar is often used as a luxury
In America It has become an "essential
element for the success of the war
among then ations of Europe.'"
"I'pon our action here," the state
ment continues, "depends the possibil
ity of maintaining the ration to our
own fighting men and those of the
allies as well as of avoiding a still
further reduction of the allotment to
the civil populations of the nations
fighting Germany, which are already
down to a point far under their normal
needs."
To assure equitable distribution of
the sugar the American public is to be
allowed, the food administration has
worked out a scheme of alienation to
the states based on population and
the needs of sugar using industries in
the states. Each state food adminis
tration will have charge of the distri
bution in his state.
FAIRBANKS AT CENTRAL
One of the heroic stunts performed
by Douglas Fairbanks In "A Modern
Muskateer," whicih will be shown at
the Central theater tomorrow, is climb
ing up the side of a steep canyon on
a rope with Marjorie Daw hanging to
his neck. The photoplay was staged
in the Grand canyon of Alzona, and
presents Fairbanks as a modern D'
Art a snail whose adventures rival those
of the famous Dumas hero. Besides
heroic deeds und thrilling scenes, tho
film abounds in typical Fairbanks
humor. Eugene Ormonde suffers all
kinds of abuse, and is finally draped
at the heels of Tully Marshall's gallop
ing horse, which act is supposed to
square a debt of the past, when Or
mcnde played Marshall fa-se and
caused him to became a fugitive from
justice.

THE BISBEE DAILY REVIEW, FRIDAY MORNING, JULY 26, 1918.
THREE
Mining and Financial News
BY REVIEW LEASED WIRE
NEW YORK, July 2S. Except Tor
the first and final hours, when deal
ings were moderately active, today's
stock market sounded the depths of
mid-summer dullness.
The heavy buying toward the end
was coincident with unofficial reports
of fresh allied gains.
As usual the advance concentrated
in such leaders as United States steel,
.Reading and the more popular indus
trials and equipments.
Steel's extreme gain of 1 was only
slightly shaded and Reading retained
all but a fraction of its two point ad
vance. Shippings, oils, Baldwin locomotive.
Industrial alcohol and the tobacco
group recorded gross gains of 1 to 214
points.
Rails as a class were again relegated
to the background. Sales, 290 pOO
shares.
Practically all time funds were with
drawn from themarket . The foreign
exchange market was unaltered.
Bonds of all classes were irregular,
but hardened with Liberty issues at
the close. Total sales, par value, 15.-
175,000. Old United. States bonds, un
changed on call.
' GRAIN
CHICAGO, July 25. Cheering war
lews bad much to do with sharp
breaks which took place to day in the
price of corn. The market closed nerv
ous, 3Vt to 3c net lower, with Aug
ust, $1.51 to $1.52 and Sepetmber
I1.52V4 to $1.52.
Oats lost to 1V4 and provisions 5
to 25c. Weakness in the corn market
developed when attention had been
centered on the military news from
France. Some renewal of peace gos
sip tended also to increase selling
,near the end of the day. Right from
the outset, moreover, bears held the
advantage owing to failure of frost
predictions. At one time, opinions
that a decided curtailment of receipts
was impending led to a notable rally.
Oats followed corn. Advices of rum
ors of a general forest in the Canadian
northwest received but little notice.
Eastern purchasing Interests were said
to be changing from an old to a new
crop.
Lower values on hogs and corn made
provisions descend. Houses with stock
yard connections were sellers.

End of the War
Only yesterday a well known Cochise
county citizen, and one wo is in more
than ordinary close touch with war activi
ties, remarked to the editor of this column,
"We've got 'em going now, and it won't
be long till the end." How ill founded
this optimism really is may be seen from a
study of our last success on the Soissons
Rheims line. The last German attack was
delivered with only half strength and we
stopped it to the right of Rheims, but it
broke through on the left and crossed the
Marne and gained six miles before we
checked it with a counter stroke south of
Soissons. Now in tluVcounter stroke we
gained fine success the first day and
reached a point where we imperiled a large
German army down in the Chateau-Thierry
salient. But we could not, with all our
might and main, get far enough to make
our gains really count. The Hun brought
up reserves by the hundreds of thousands
and held his line. Is still holding his
dangerous salient. He has still a half mil
lion of reserves not yet touched that he
may well launch in another attack some
where along the line. The fact is, we seem
to have weathered the 1 9 1 8 storm. Rein
forcements from America and fine general
ship and fighting spirit have reduced our
peril to the minimum. We have even
gained slight successes. But to conclude
that we have the Prussia going, is to in
dulge in folly. We have not yet started on
that colossal task.
As General March said the other day,
we hope to make a real drive before the
end of the year.
A study of the foreign dispatches dis
closes the fact that the Germans have never
fought better than they are fighting now.
In spite of their reverses south of Soissons
and their heavy losses they are holding the
line with their old stubborness and desper
ation. The Americans, young and strong
and fresh and filled with fiery energy and
plenty of good food, are fighting like tigers;
the French, cheered by the coming of fresh
levies, are fighting better than ever before.
But these attacking tigers must struggle for
every foot of ground and earn every trench.
Consider the case of the village of
Epides, a few miles north and east of
Chateau Thierry. It was reported taken
and passed three days ago, and yesterday
morning the dispatches said that the Amer
icans had just taken it for the third time,
which means that they have lost it twice.
If the German morale is low it is not evi
dent in the allied accounts of the recent
battles all the way from Soissons to
Rheims.
Major Douglas declared in hi's Bisbee
speech that no news comes out of Germany
except that which the German general staff
desires us to know, and that only by over
whelming force of arms can we beat the
Hun. We may well have to fight bitterly
every yard of the way to the Rhine. And
then again, there is always the possibility
of a sudden German collapse. But there
have been no signs of even failing morale
on the western front up to date.
Let us look the situation squarely in the
face. Foch's recent offensive was a suc
cess only insofar as it relieved the pressure
where the Germans had broken through
south of the Marnc. In fact, it enabled our
troops to reconquer most of the ground
lost. But as a blow against the German
armies or the taking of ground that would
force a withdrawal, or as a pincers move
ment, it has so far failed of success. A
harder blow, and one longer sustained and
carrying more power in men and gun3 be
hind it will be required to even beat the
Germans back from their deep salients in
the allied lines.
The end of he war is longer than a year
distant at the very least. Blood will flow
in rivers before the allies cross the river
Rhine. BUT, quoting again from Major
Douglas inspiring speech, "WE WILL
WIN, NEVERTHELESS !" And let us re
member that overconfidence is almost as
bad as lack of confidence.
THE GERMANS AND THE MOON
The Pall Mall Gazette of London and
other English publications have advanced
the theory that the Germans did not make
the recent offensive they had planned, al
though all arrangements had been com
pleted for it, because they were awaiting
a favorable phase of the moon. If such
was the case, their delay was sanctioned by
German customs and tradition, 2000 years
old, according to Tacitus, and other ancient
historians, who have described battles of
the Germania.
When Caesar was making his conquest
of Gaul in 56 B. G, his aid was solicited
agianst an invader from beyond the Rhine,
the German chieftain, Arivistus. On one
occasion the German could not be provoked
to give battle for several days because the
moon was not favorable. Although Caesar
advanced his forces under the very nose of
the chieftain, entrenched in his camp 600
yards in front of them, Arivistus would not
fight. The "Wise Women," or proph
etesses, had foretold disaster if the battle
was made before the full moon, and the
Germania dared not disregard the predic
tions of these women who they believed
were inspired by the gods. They believed
sancity and prescience were inherent to
women, and that their counsels and divina
tions must be revered.
Caesar had requested an interview with
Arivistus. He had demanded a cessation
of the introduction of German forces across
the Rhine, the surrender of the hostages of
the friendly Aedui, which Arivistus re
fused. Caesar then hurried to seize the for
tified city of Besancon, toward which Ari
vistus was marching. Arivistus, to gain
time until the forces of the Suebi could join
him, asked an interview of the Roman. On
a historic mound, north of Besancon, the
two arrayed in armor on horseback, with
ten witnesses on each side, met. Two hun
dred yards behind Caesar was a Roman
legion the same distance behind Ari
vistus, a troop of horse.
When Caesar learned what the Germans
wanted, he broke off the interview, and gal
loped back to his army. He then set about
trying to make Arivistus give battle. Learn
ing from captives that the Germans were
awaiting a favorable change of the moon,
he finally made the offensive, and after a
bloody fight at the present Mumpelgard in
upper Alsace, he forced the Germans to
retreat.
Like Foch, the new Bisbee city admin
istration made an offensive upon the road
from the depot to the county paving in
Johnson addition, and, like Foch, they did
not progress very far until they stopped.
But Foch had to stop. He was faced by
hundreds of thousands of German reserves.
The city administration was faced by slag
dump hill and the waves and shell holes
all the way from the foot of the hill to the
county paving (note the "county.") But
these iare not unsurmountable obstacles.
The city fathers paved the street from the
depot to the head of the hill and a mighty
good job they did of it; in fact it is the
only smooth surface street in the city. But
why pave part of the road to Warren and'
leave great gaps that are as rough as a
duck's foot? Slag hill and the road below
it have not even been repaired so that one
might notice it since hector was a pup.
This column supported both Foch and the
Bisbee administration before they assumed
their respective commands. And it still
has faith that both offensives started by its
favorites will yet be carried to a successful
Conclusion. Hasten the day, and more
power to it when it comes.
The sentiment, yes, the temper of the
people of the land regarding the prosecu
tion of the war to a definite victory in the
field, may well be gauged by the incident
upon the streets of Bisbea Wednesday
night during the speech of James Douglas.
In that crowd that packed three streets
facing the Phelps Dodge store platform
could have been found the representatives
types of every class of men and women in
this district. They cheered often during
the speech, but they cheered loudest and
longest when Douglas decla'ed that he
favored fighting the war to "!i finish and
hoped he was dead if any peace but the
right kind of peace was made-
s
It is stated that the bolshevik have or
dered the mobilization of an army in Mos
cow. If this is true ft means that the Ger
mans have other reserves upon which to
draw.

LIBERTY BONDS
CONVERTIBLE TO
NEW ISSUE
NEW PLAN MUST BE
ARRANGED SAY
Bank3 Requesting Holders to
Present Them at Once so
That New 4V4 Per Cent
Bonds Can Be Secured
The banks of the Warren district
are advising the holders of Liberty
bonds of the first and second issues
that bear 4 per cent to convert them
into new bonds that bear 4 1-4 per
cent. The bonds can be converted at
any time between now and the first
of November. They do not advise the
conversion of the ZVz per cent bonds
ff the first istue. The banks upon
the presentation of the bonds for con
ersion iasue a receipt for the same
and the bonds are sent to the federal
reserve bank at Dallas, Tex., where
the new bond is issued and then 3ent
'jack to the bank.
The bank requests that the holders
begin now to bring lu the bonds so
that there will not be a big rush at
the expiration of the time draws to a
close.
The federal reserve bank at Dallas
has sent instructions to the various
banks in the district in regard to the
conveision and a part of the instruc
tions read as follows:
'"AH of the outstanding issues of
Liberty loan bends may be converted
into new 4 1-4 bonds, but the 4 1-4
Donds issued upon such conversion
will not be Third liberty loan bonds.
They will have the same dates for
payment of interest, the same dates of
mi'tiiVity of principle and the same
dates for redemption as the bonds re
ceived for conversion and in exchange
for which they have been issued."
"Holders of f irst Liberty loan a
have the privilege of converting into
4 1-4 per cent bonds on or before X
vember 9, 191S. and also have the
privilege of converting Liberty loan
3's into .any subsequent issue of
bonds issued before the termination
of the war with the Imperial German
government. Holders of the first Lib
erty loan Z'& will lose by convert
ing into 4 1-4 bonds such particular
tax exemption features as apply speci
fically to the first Liberty loan. The
first Liberty loan 3's are free from
all taxation except inheritance taxes."
"Then olders of the first and second
Liberty loan 4's have the privilege of
converting their bonds into 4 1-4's on
or before November 9, 1918. The 4's
and 4 1-4's are free from normal taxes.
but are subject to super taxes and ex
cess taxes where the aggregate hold
ings exceed SG.OnO."
"Five per cent of the amount out
standing in any one year of all bonds
issued or converted since September
24, 1917 may, be purchased by the
government for the sinking fund."

sprung by final overwhelming blows
on both sides. In that event, an oi
the victories pictured in tonight's ru
mors might well be realized.
To the cool judgment of army offi
cers, however, the situation did not
warrant on the basis of any informa
tion available at a late hour tonight,
the assumption that the time had come
when the jaws of Foch's great vise
might be crushed together. Knowing
what they do of the strength of the
Germans massed to hold bark the men
acing flank attacks they believed it en
tirely possihle for the enemy to escape
northward.
The situation cannot be clearly
gauged until further information is re
ceived as to the Franco-British oper
ations west of Rheims. If the attack
is pressed successfully, it seems Im
possible that the enemy can stabilize
his line south of the Aisne.
Secretary Baker has so far received
no word of the American losses in the
present fighting. German press re
ports of tens of thousands of Amer
ican dead before their lines are put
out as a sop to the German people
it is believed. Mr. Baker's attention
was c.illed to the German dispatch re
ferring to the American troops as fur
ther Yiinnon fonder" Pt ',ltn action
"The best information we have," he
said, 'seems to indicate that tJie Ger
mans are themselves supplying most
f Material at the present time.
, "Vi have no reports on our casual
ties as yet. but our people nave a inu. n
better opportunity to know our losses
tlian the Germans have because we
are taking tround they have been giv
ing up and in that situation we have
a supcrio" opportunity fur observation."
CONSOLIDATION CONFIRMED
DENVER, Colo.. July 25. The Mo
doc company, operating the mine of
the same name at Cripple Creek. Colo.,
will assume the operation also of the
Last Dollar, adjoining, according to
local officials of the company. The
Modoc mine and the Lost Dollar have
a production record of more than five
mililon dollars and have been only
partly worked.
The Modoc is building a new two
compartment shaft, which is to be
sunk to the 20' 0 foot level to open up
large knewn ore bodies within the Mo
doc mine, and which have been partly
developed through an old incline shaft
to a depth of 1200 feet. Operations
will at once be directed to the .Modoc
mine from the Last Dollar shaft, w hi.-h
has attained a depth or 1500 feet, and
from which shaft the development of
the entire consolidated properties will
be carried on.
PERSHING CORRECTS
WRONG IMPRESSION
(Hv llevlew Leased Wire
WASHINGTON. July 25 General
Pershing in a cablegram to the war
department today corrected an error
in the American communication of
July 3 whereby thirteen officers and
men of the manne corps were listed as
having awarded distinguished service
crosses posthumously whereas the
names should have been listed with
those who survived the engagement in
which they distinguished themselves.
The error, -the war department an
nounced, was due to the ommission
of a paragraph of the communication.
The officers and men incorrectly
listed were:
Captains Keller E. Hockey and John
H. Fay; First Lieutenants K.l v. B.
Hope; Past Assistant Snrgean Ricnarci
O'Shea: Surgeon Paul T. Dense. Ser
geant Major Carl J. Morstrand: Ser

Mrs. Anderson of Willcox
Calls Attention to Recent
Article in Which Knitting
Work Is Said to Be Useless
FIX
When Mrs. C. O. Anderson, of Will
cox, member of the Willcox chapter of
the American Ked Cross, and auxiliary
of the Tucson chapter of the same or
ganization, objected to Alan Dale's ar
ticle in a late issue cf the Literary Di
gest, the Arizona woman pointed to
some propaganda which needed atten
tion. The article in question was en
titled "Why Not to Knit."
The Tucson chapter, of which Wlil
cox is a part, is going ahead with Its
work, regardless of etforts to stem the
tide of garments for the troops over
seas. The letter of Mrs. Andersoi.,
however, caused the Pacific nealqu.'.r
ters to write in the following vein of
the article in question: '
' Airs. C. O. Anderson.
Willcox Branch. A. R. C,
Willcox, Arizona.
'"My Dear Madam:
"Your favor of the 15th inst. regard
ing the article appearing in the Lite
rary Digest'. "Why Not to Knit', is re;
ceived. Concerning same. 1 will stale
that the writer, Mr. Dale, is merely ex
pressing one man's opinion of the knit
ting problem, and it should not be
taken seriously.
"The Red Cross is receiving its wool
directly through the government at
the etaoi taoi to '.srWI'detaoinunun
this time, and all purchases of wool
(as well as the purchase of all ma
terials) are now being made directly
through the division warehouses
throughout the nation. Our knitted
goods are distributed, not as many
people think, by standing the solJiers
up iu a line and the Red Cross field
directors handing out the knitted
toods. but through the quartermaster's
department of the army and only ou
the requi.-ition of the commanding 'of
ficer. In this manner you can plainly
see that we are co-operating with tho
government and supplying the soldiers
with comforts that are needed, lut not
included in their regular supplier al
lotted by the government itself, so you
can be assured that if tny necessity
existed for the discontinuance of knit
ting by the American people, cn ac
count of conserving the wool for other
uses, the Red Cross, being a direct
arm of the government, would be the
first to respond to the-government's
needs.
".Mr. Dale makes a big point of the
impracticability of the knitted abdom
inal band worn by the soldier to col
lect vermin. With reference to this.
1 have just called up our supply bu
reau and find that we have never ship
ped a single band of this description
or for that purpose, but that a number
of these had been sent to us more
than a year ago from a few chapters
who were working independently and
a few were raveled and the wool used
for other purposes, as this was not a
Red Cross activity.
"We would appreciate your giving
such publicity to these facts as you
can, in order that the work allotted
to the chapters at this time will not
be retarded by the effect of tjiis fan
atical article by Mr. Dale."

GOVERNMENT MAY
MINIMUM
FOR LABOR
William Davis Thinks It More
Than Likely This Step Will
Be Taken Along With Distribution
lite P.rview I .eased Wlrel
DENVER. Colo.. July 25. When the
government takes over distribution of
unskilled labor it is more than prob
able, according to William A. Davis.
spec'al agent of the department of
labor, that a minimum wage for un
skilled labor will be fixed.
The plans for the organization of
the federal employment services pro
vide for establishment of two state
boards. In the first instance there
will be state advisory board ot five
members; consisting of a state direc
tor, two representatives of labor and
two of management. The chairman of
the board will be a representative of
the I'nited States employment service.
The board will have the power of mak
ing recommendations for the person
nel of the employment service in their
respective states and will advise re
garding the recruiting and the distri
bution of labor and will have advisory
powers regarding questions of general
policies. In addition there will also
be community boards in each indus
trial community, composed of one rep
resentative of the I'nited States em
ployment service, one representative
of labor and one of local employes. The,
community boards will be the medium
through which local employers en
gaged in war industries will appeal
for laborers and all details of the ac
tual workings of the new distrtbutory
system will be handled by these
boards.
DESOLATION MARKS
RECOVERED REGION
WITH THE AMERICAN ARMY ON
THK AISNSB- MARNB FRONT. July
2a (By The Associated Press). A des
olate shell torn waste and burning of
houses and towns mark the zone evac
uated by the Germans, and indications
are that should the sailent of Soissons
Rheims be recovered there probably
will not be a village within it or a
house standing with its walls intact.
At Oulchy-En-Chateau. lor the pos
session of which the Franco-American
troops struggled for two days, fires
had been observed for two days. It ii
unknown whether they were started
by the Germans or from the shells of
the allied guns.
Neither side is permitting sentiment
to enter into the situation. There has
been no battle which has displayed a
greater spirit of merciless sacrifice.
Village after village has been subject
ed to terrible artillery fire, until their
appearance indicated that the guns
had been aided by an earthquake In
their destruction.
The Germans have occupied and of
ten fortified every village and farm
house, using them to the last And
the allies have not hesitated to reduce
them. The grain fields and vineyards
have escaped, although it is expected
that thousands of acres of over ripe
wheat will be lost through a lack of
harvesters.
The grain fields were saved owins
to the rapid retreat of the German w ho
in only a few instances set fire to
them. A slower retreat would have
resulted in greater destructions.
The allies are definitely on the up
grade and the Germans show distinct
sigus. of recognizing- nhis situation.
The morale in the German ranks ap
pears to have suffered seriously from
the setback and this condition is ac
centuated by the knowledge that the
enormous losses of the past fortnight
have fallen on the flower of the Ger
man army, namely, their storm troops,
which have been combed out from all
fronts and which admittedly are Irre
placeable. BALFOUR SPEAKS ON
SUBJECT OF WAR
LONDON, July 25. A. J. Balfour,
secretary for foreign affairs, speaking
todav at a meeting to inaugurate thi
Serbian war aims committee of Lon
don, said now that the world had had
time to consider the underlying dii
lerences in Ideals which separated
civilized mankind in two bitterly op
posed camps, it had come to realize
that perhaps the most important of
these differences was the treatment
that should be accorded by great
btates to small states and by all stalea
to each other.
It was Itusttia's unprovoked attack
on Serbia and Germany's attack on
Belgium he declared, which awoke the
conscience of civilized mankind to the
terrors which militarism had tor man
kind in the future and had gradually
brought In one nation after another to
resist the forces which would have
drawn them all under the hexl ot Au
stria's master The" German enipiie
There was no comparison possiDle ue
tween what a German victory would
mean and what an allied victory would
mean. Nothing could be more certain
that in pioportuin as the allies were
successful so would ypread the allies'
Ideals of national liberty development
and independence. And nothing coull
be more certain than that In propor
tion as the Germans were successful
so would the area under Gennan domi
nation, economic, cultural and politi
cal, spread Miasma over the whole civ
ilized world.
"On the result of the struggle fr
the supremacy ol those two ideals,"
said Mr. Balfour, "the one from Heav
en, the other from hell, depends the
fate of the world."

THE REVIEW
Job Department

r
rible pains in and about my stomach
at times that I ciralJ hardly stand it
I would get in all kinds of position)
trying to get some ease, but the only
way 1 could get any relief was to lay
harj on my stomach, and for two
weeks 1 never slept two hours a hikik.
I was under treatment several limes,
and tried all kinds of medicines, and
still got no relief and when they told
me I could never get well without an
operation I felt thai my trouble must
ue very serious.
'I used to weigh 175 pounds bul I
kept falling off until I got to be very
thin. When I began taking Tanlac
about two months ago 1 just weigiie.-:
125 pounds, but now 1 weigh 150 nave
gained twenty-five pounds and am
still gaining. I can eat most anything
I want without it hurting me and 1
seldom ever have a pain of any kind.
I feel almost like a girl again and
while I am 61 years of age 1 can do as
much housework as lota ot women1
who are much younger than lam. I
certainly do give Tanlac all credit for
my wonderful improvement and am
willing to tell everybody what 1 think
ot it."
