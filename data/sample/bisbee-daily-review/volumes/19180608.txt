(By Review Leased Wire)
WASHINGTON, June 7. A bumper
wfce.it crop this year, which before
harsest mav develop into a production
I cf p billion bushels, was forecast to
i day bv the department of agriculture
' in its June crop report giving the lirnt
ri('i"Rtioii of the size of this years
spring wheat output.
Lasini' its estimate on June 1 cor.-diticn.-,
the department forecast a to
tal wheat production of 9U,00).0iO
bushels, which would plrc3 thi.i year's
harvest as the second largest !a the
histcry of the country.
ln June o' 1915 a total wheat pro
duction of 850,000,000 bushels was
forecast and the quantity gradually
crept upward until the final figures for
the year showed the crop to be 1,025,
800.000 bushels.
The acreage sown io spring wheat
this year is larger by 2,000.001) acres
than ever sown beKire and 21.5 per
ccm larger than lm year, a
-'2.4S9.00U acres. The cendi,
greg.Uiiig
tion of the
crop on June 1 was 95.2 per cent of
normal, or 1.5 per cent better than the
ten-year average. A production of
344,000,000 bushels was forecast. That
is 111.000,000 bushels more than har
vested last year and only about 7,000,-
000 bushels less than the record spring
wheat harvest of 1915.
Winter wheat, growing on the sec
ond largest acreage ever planted,
showed a condition of 3 per cent bet
ter than the ten-year average, with
S3.8 per cent of a normal. A produc
tion of 587.000,000 bushels was fore
cast, which is 15,000,000 bushels move
than forecast from conditions existing
May 1. Such a crop would be the
third size grown in this country.
The oats crop also promises to be
of recoid proportions.
On an acreage 2.1 per cent larger
than Jast year, when the record croo,
l,5li7,0OO,0Oo bushels was grown, June
1 conditions warrant a torecatt of
1.500,000,000 bushels. Only last year's
and the crop of 1915 exceeded that
quantity. Rye production will be
record, the forecast being 81.0OO.O0J
bushels, which is blightly less than
was forecast in May. Last year's crop
was 60,100,00 bushels which was a
record.

LONDON, June 7. Reuter's limited,

"The American force operating to

This force now has been engaged for

"The Americans themselves believe
they have been holding up a German
advance that was intended to extend
the front along the valley of the M-irne,
but the German methods rather sug
gest a reluctant acceptant of a fight

that the Americans hare as elsewhere

One of the most encouraging things,

In his reference to the Americans,
the premier 'said:
"I have just returned from France
where I met a French statesman 'ho
had been at the battle front soon after
an engagement where the Americans
fought. He was full of admiration,
not merely for their superb valor but
the trained skill with which they at
tacked and defeated the foe. His re
port of the conduct of the American
troops, a division which had been in
action for the first time, was one of
the most encouraging things that I
have heard. We know that when ever
they appear in the battle line they will
fight in a way worthy of the great tra

struggle lasting a whole night. With
this last named division the Americans
were still employed when the corre
spondent left the field, at which time
the omens were favorable to the Americans.
Germans Poorly Fed
Judging from further statements of
prisoners, the Germans were badly in
need of rest and, according to appe
tites, they were sorely in need of food.
Inadequate artillery backing given to
the first two German divisions sup
ports the idea that the enemy did not
expect an offensive, and that the guns
they used last night and this morn
ing were hurried to a point where it
was not expected they wvould be need
ed. On the other nand, it was largoly
owing to the superior gunnery oi ibe
Americans that the first two e:iemy
divisions were compelled to give
ground and had to suffer severe casual
ties.
"But if the enemy was short of r.rtl-
lcry he appeared to have an un limit
ed number of machine guns which
were used with great skill and effect.
The Germans evidently extended their
practice of sacrificing a machine gun
or two in untenable positions in order
to bring their captors under a deadly
flank fire. This maneuver took toll
of the Americans as indicated by the
number of machine gun bullet wounds,
and the surgeon explained that a ma
jority of such wounds had been re
ceived by a great many of the men.
Overcome Stiff Defense
"In the river valley, which contains
a railroad, the stiffest fighting of the
night occurred, the enemy showing
great determination to hold the rail
way station of Bouresches. This sta
tion, w ith the entire village, utimately
fell into the hands of the Americana
and the French.
"One reason why the fighting last
night was so desperate was because
the German counter attack was launch
cdat the very moment our fresh ad
uince began, the men thus coming into
close grips in which the boyonet played
a decisive part. The American casual
ties were not out of proportion to the
magnitude of the operation, but owing
to the unfaltering courage of the ma
rines, the losses largely have fallen on
that fine regiment of redoubtable
fighters.

near the sun, may possibly be given
a positive ldentiy. The great solar
force that makes Mercury shake with
an astral ague as it spins around , its
orbit may be uncovered. A thousand
theories may be proven or repdiated,
chief of them being the theory of
relativity, first suggested by Einstein,
a German physicist
The nubbin of this theory is that
tie light from stars beyond the sun
is bent by the sun's gravity before
it reaches the earth in about the same
manner that a street car rail is bent
around .a slight curve. The eclipse
is expected to prove whether such sun
gravity can bend light or not.
The eclipse is expected also to
throw some light on the composition
of the sun's spectrum, which, during
the period of totality, glows with a
greenish hue. What makes it green
is the question the scientists arc go
ing to try to answer! Points of simi
larity and dissimilarity between the at
mospheres of the.- snn and the earth
are to be given close attention also.
The polarized light of the sun will
also attract interest Scientists at the
W"IT
University of California, near hero,
and elsewhere say that, the lislit
around the sun moves in regular waves
like wireless air waves, instead of be
ing 1 a steady, even substance, as
around the. earth. The eclipse may
exnlain this difference.
The corona spectrum of the sun,
according to Professor E. P. Lewis.
denartment of physics,
California, is made up of unknown ele
ments. Professor Lewis is to study
this coronal spectrum through a large
ouartz speetogYaph as a member of the
Lick Observatory party at Goldendale,
Wash. The spectograph, in the event
of clear weather, is expected to reveal
many new and startling fac(3 concern
ing this corona and accompanying
spectrum.
The war has had some effect on the
plan's for observing the phenomena,
many of the scientfcts who observe
such things now being engaged oi pre
liminary study of the great German
eclipse, which is due "somewhere in
France" at an nnnamed date.
Stations have been established, how
ever, by the Lick observatory at Cold
endale, the fnited States naval observ
atory at Baker, Ore., the Yerkes and
Mount Wilson observatories at Green
River, Wyo., the Alleghany. Chamber-
I lain and Yerkes observatories at Den
ver, the Drake observatory at Mathe
son. Col., the Sproul observatory at
Eads. Col., and the Smithsonian Astro
physical observatory at a point in
Kansas.
These stations are all on the line to
be drawn by the great astral pencil
and are situated at all sorts of -altitudes
to get all possible effects.
The eclipse will begin at 7:29 in the
mornine at a point south of Japan
and will end at the I'ahama islands,
east of Florida, at 7.29 in the evening,
Greenwich mean time. The shadow
will enter the United States at 2:53
in the afternoon. Pacific standard time,
or 3:55 daylight saving time, and will
leave at 5:41, Central standard time.
or 6:41, daylight saving time.
The line of totality will be ntty
miles wide and that of semi-totality
150 miles wide. The eclipse will be
visible, however, in varying phases all
over North and Central Ariierica uid

LEGISLATURE BACK
TO OPENING POINT
(By Review Lenswl Wire)
There has been no let-up in the of
fensive of the American and French
troops against the Germans in the
region northwest of Chateau Thierry.
University ofjwnere In the past two days severe
defeats have been inflicted on the
enemy and American marines have
won .great praise for their valiant
fighting.
Battling shoulder to shoulder over
a front of six miles from Vinly, which
lies just to tno northwest of Veuilly-La-Pott?rie,
to Rcuresches, the Amer
icans and French have captured
the towns of Veuilly-La-Poterie and
Bourches and al" made progress ail
along the front. Previously Torcy had
fallen into the hands of the Amer
icans. Progress Everywhere
Nowhere on this battle line have the
Germans been able to stay the efforts
of the allied troops, although they
have fought with great tenacity. The
marines everywhere have declined to
take a backward step, guing forward
against the enemy even when he had
superiority in numbers. Close pressed,
the marines, have given the Germans
a taste of cold steel, even in the face
of machine gun fire; surrounded they
have fought their way through the
gray-coated lines with their bayonet.!.
From all accounts there has been no
part or the game of modern warfare
in which the men from overseas have
not excelled the enemy.
The losses to the enemy thus far are
declared to have been extremely heavy
and the terrain they have lost is con
sidered of high stragetic value, inas
much as it is on that part of the bat
tie front through which the Germans
had hoped to crush their way forward
and' attain an open road to Paris. The
casualties of the enemy were particu
larly severe in the street fightin?
in Bouresches where the Americans
pushed him back step by step.
Americans Rush Enemy
The plans of the American command
did not include the capture of Torcy,
but when the marines reached the ob
jective assigned to them their ardor
for battle could not be restrained, and
they kept on untij the village was in
their hands. Twenty-five of the ma
rines drove out 200 Germans from
Torcy.
Hard held on the other sectors from
Foisscns'to Chateau Thierry the Ger
mans, a.ter.very heavy bombardments,
have essayed attacks on the Marne
frora near Rheims. These attacks
were ill-starred and the enemy had
to accept defeat. A French attack ut
Bligny resulted in that village falling
into their hands in its entirety.
On the remainder of the battle
fronts there is still slight activity
aside from bombardments and patrol
encounters.

PHOENIX. June 7. The Senate
Council of Defense bill was killed this
morning in the senate by vote of 22

the governor did not like the measure.
as it almost took the appointing power
from his hands and that he might be
expected to veto it Yet the vote to
pass embraced all the administration
supporters, one of whom , Walton, has
moved for reconsideration tomorrow.
Three new council of defense bills
were introduced. In the house, Hous
er offered on. that placed everything
in the governor's hands, making a
council of governor, attorney general
and nine appointees, all to serve at
the governor's pleasure. The house

Oratory In House
Most of the afternoon in the house
was spent in oratory over the Eddy
anti-loafing bill, the administration
representatives generally denouncing
it as an attack upon the poor working
man. and demanding that it be amend
ed to include the conscription of
wealth, utilization of al! idle land and
the working of mines at fullest capacity.
Foster of Cochise demanded that
the mining companies employ the men
who wandered the streets jobless
rather than import men. which brought
the retort from Lines, "I do not be
lieve an employer should be forced to
employ a man whom he does not
want, nartieularly an agitator or I. W
W." Friends of the measure told that
it is the same as what had been adop
ted in maryland and Rhode Island. In
the end there was no action and the
fight will be continued tomorrow.
The house nassed the bill cutting
out petitions In primary elections, the

Cardoi Made Her Well.
Texas City, Tex. In an interesting
statement, Mrs. Q. H. Schill, of this town,
says: "For three years I suffered untold
agony with my head. I was unable lb
do any of my work.
I Just wanted to sleep all the time, for
that was the only ease I could get, v-hen
I was asleep. 1 became a nervous wreck
just from the awful suffering with my
head.
I was so nervous that the least noise
would make me jump out of my bed. I
had no energy, and was unable to do
anything. My son, a young boy, had to
do all my household duties.
I was not able to do anything until I
took Cardui. I took three bottles in all
and it surely cured me of those awful
headaches. That has been three years
ago, and I know the cure is permanent,
for I have never had any headache since
taking Cardui. . .
Nothing relieved me until I took Cardui.
It did wonders for me."

Enter, the Americans!
How this morning's war news thrilled
every loyal heart! The Americans are
coming into their own in the great war.
Without a particle of silly pride or raw
arrogance, we sent them over there, hope
strong in our heart, faith in our soul. Our
army was a brand new war machine, as
sembled from .farm and counter and desk
and work bench, and it was to fight with
the famous and tried war machines of
France and England against the notorious
Prussian machine. We knew that the Am
erican was a handy lad with the gun and
bayonet and that he could stand a lot of
marching and beating and hard work. But
as to how he would take to the gas mask
and the intrenching tool and the half score
of modern war sciences, we did not know.
He had faced cannon balls and grape and
canister, but high explosives and machine
guns were new to him in actual practice.
Well, we know pretty well, now. And
so does the Hun. At Chateau Thierry the
Americans have won deathless renown.
Bearing the brunt, at the apex of the wedge
they have outfought the Prussian for three
straight days. They are putting the punch
into the allied lines at this point. They took
Catigny and held it against all that the Ger-.
mans could do. Skill and speed they have,
as well as the old American punch and
eager vim.
Yesterday's exploit, following several
lesser ones since the last offensive started,
means that they are going to call upon
those "raw and untrained Americans lev
ies" by the thousand to help turn the tide.
Far be it from this column to indulge in
vain boasting. The war is young yet for
us. But we have made a good start. No
use talking, the heart and the spirit are half
of it, and the skill and training only the
other half. When great armies lock in a
death grapple, the strong arm and the
brave heart play a mighty part in the result.
However, this is perilously close to b6ast
ing. But, anyway, doesn't the news in the
war dispatches this morning thrill you
through and through in some unaccounta
ble cave man manner? Foch is reaping
where Lafayette sowed so long ago. Pretty
fair crop, eh?
THE GOVERNMENTS VITAL
BLOW AT THE I. W. W.
(From the El Paso Herald)
A small item appeared in the newspapers
a few days ago to the effect that an army
of wheat harvesters organized by the Unit
ed States employment services would soon
open its campaign in the southern states,
harvesting the wheat crop in Texas and
Oklahoma, thence moving north into Kan-'
sas and Missouri and progress gradually
northward with the ripening of the crop3
until they reached Minnesota. Then, after
the Minnesota harvest,' the men would
cross into Canada at the request of the
Canadian government and assist in the
great wheat fields of the dominion. Though
it was not so stated, it is to be hoped that"
the wheat harvesting army will not confine
its labors to the relatively narrow strip of"
territory indicated, but that it will be 'di
vided so as to take in California, Oregon
and the Dakotas in the west and northwest
and work also in some of the eastern wheat
producing states. It is a good idea, this
army of the wheat crop and capable of ex
pansion to embrace all sections of the coun
try. Little, if any, publicity has been given to
this plan heretofore. It is evident enough
that the government is preparing to assist,
to the utmost in rooting out the strong I.
W. W. element which has so endangered
the wheat crops of the past few years by
burning fields of grain, damaging machin
ery and otherwise employing what it is
pleased to term "direct action." The I. W.
W. has more strength among the harvest
hands than in any other one line of indus
try, so far as the government's investiga
tors have been able to ascertain. Certainly
the documents presented in evidence by the
government at the I. W. W. trial in Chicago
show that the members devoted chief atten
tion to grain fields and the copper mines.
It isiunlikely that Industrial Workers of the
World would enroll in the government's
wheat harvesting army and most unlikely
that any acts of sabotage would be tolerated.
In fact, so strong is the sentiment which has
been aroused against the I. W. W. that
acts of sabotage or even words com
mendatory of any of the principles of
the I. W. W. are going to be fraught with
danger. To illustrate, two or three men
professing to be labor union members but
probably I. W. W's also, have coine to El
Paso and, in mingling with other union
men, have aired I. W. W. opinions. It is
gratifying that in each instance these men
have been peremptorily ordered to change
their tactics immediately and have been
forced, if not to change their views, at least
to keep them to themselves.
If the government can help the farmers
eliminate the I. W. W. from the grain fields
a long step will have been taken toward
checkmating the evil organization. If it
has been very strong among farm laborers
it has been strong also in the logging camps
of the Pacific northwest where timber for
ships and for airplanes is beins cut. The
cutting of spruce, however, is now under
the direction of a colonel of the signal corps
and 1 0,000 draft men are about to be sent
into the spruce forests to do this work. It ,
is therefore evident that in this important
part of the timber producing industry the
I. W. W. is to be eliminated for" the draft
men will not cherish any I. W. W. views.
If there are any I. W. W. in the ship'ards
or the munition plants, they are keeping
well under cover. Those industries have
not suffered from their malice. If they
could be driven out of the mines, the task
of eliminating the I. W. W. would be rea
sonably well completed. It may be that the
mining states of the west will undertake
that task, now that there is a sedition law,
by encouraging the arrest and prosecution
of I. W. W. as seditious persons for hardly
an I. W. W. but could be convicted of se
ditious acts or utterances or both. '
Much depends, however, on the attitude
of state governments toward the I. W. W.
menace. It is unfortunate that in Arizona,
which the I. W. W. is making a battle
- ground, a sort of place for a last stand, a
refuge in time of storm, the administration
is, if not friendly, at least not bitterly hos
tile to the I. W. W. If Gov. G. W. P. Hunt
were to issue an emphatic denunciation of
the I. W. W. as a treasonable, crirninal or
ganization and urge all county attorneys
to cooperate with the department of justice
investigators and the United States district
attorney in obtaining evidence for the con
viction of every I. W. W., the fight would
be half won before a single malefactor was
arrested. But he will not. Gov. Hunt
does net smite the I. W. W. with a mailed
fist. He strokes it with a soothing, gentle
hand.
The governor seems to think the hun
dreds of Industrial Workers in Arizona
those same men who tied .up copper pro
duction when the government needed the
metal so greatly for war purposes were
brought into the state by the mining com
panies in an effort to discredit union labor.
But even if he believes that to be true, Gov.
Hunt could then do nothing which would
more completely confotmd the mine oper
ators than to make it impossible for the I.
W. W. to thrivejn Arizona. Nor could he
do anything more helpful to the cause of
genuine union labor than to lend his aid to
eliminating this pernicious organization,
one of whose aims is to wage a secret war
against the Western Federation of Miners,
directly and the American Federation of
Labor indirectly as the letters introduced at
Chicago show plainly. Thus if the gover
nor is a patriot, a friend of the state as a
whole and a staunch upholder of organized
labor, as he says he is, the consistent thing
for him to do would be to smitte the I. W.
W. between the eyes before it can have
another chance to foment strikes in the
copper mines.
Provisions of the workmens compensa
tion law which is proposed for initiation at
the election this fall, will prove a boon to
the small operator and the leaser in the Ari
zona mines. Under the present law the
small mine worker and the leaser face actu
al ruin if one of their employes is seriously
injured. Many instances in which an hon
est, hard working operator of small means
has been financially ruined through the
death of one of his employes, can be point
ed to in the past few years. Under this
new law, the small man, the leaser 'and
mine operator of meagre financial standing
will be afforded a protection, which will as
sure him at a minimum cost, protection
from ruin. At the same time indemnities
to the working man who is employed by
the leaser or small mine owner are assured;
and this is no small item to the working
man, for instances in which the employer
has not been able to meet the indemnities
have been known in the past.

" " ..
It was understood when tno Lund
started out the expenses of the nip
were to be paid by the Arizona Auto
Club of Phoenix, wnlcfi guaranteed tx
penses. Since then each town that
j the band has visited has been asked to j
guarantee tne expenses ot tne Dana to
us town. On account of this matter,
there has been no one in tho jiat
rict that wished to guarantee the ex
penses which would amount to several
hundred dollars. There Is no place
where the band could give an open air
concert where admission couiti ue
charged, so that the money, or part
of it, could be collected.
The Phoenix Gazette of Thuisday
has the following to say about the itin -
erary of the band:
'"Prescott, June 7; Clarkdale, June 8;
I Jerome. June U; Ash Fork, lor a biir
stop, June 10; Williams, June 11; Fiag-
stait. June VI; Winslow, June 13; Hut J
brook, June 14; Phoenix, June li; Tuc
son, June 16; Globe and Miami, June
17-1S; Bisbee, June 19 20.
"As a result o the legislature hav
ing adopted a resolution authorizing
the expenses ef the band on this trip
to be paid out of state funds as a part
of the military expenses of Arizona; all
the money earned by the band will be
tunieu over to me metnoers ior meir
benefit." .
There is no one here that has hoard
officially that the expenses arc to br
paid by the state and it was under-
stood that the legislature had so rur
failed to pass the resolution of which
the Gazette speaks. An etfort will be
made to determine whether or not tue
band is coming within the next few
days.
