. Prepares Counter-testimony
CHICAGO, Nov. 3. Evidence . in
tended to show that methods employ
ed in assembling the first Pan car
were perfectly regular and such as
were used by many reputable automo
bile companies, was introduced today
by Attorney Cummins, defending 13
cfficials of the Pan Motor company,
on trial on charge of misusing the
mails in promotion of the company.
The prosecution countered by bring
ing in evidence to show that Pandolfo
was dissatisfied with the first model
which Reed and Glazer, engineers of
Indianapolis, had made for him at the
time he was advertising it as a very
good car. The attorneys for the gov
ernment also brought out testimony
to show that while certain circulars
which Pandolfo was purported to have
been using at that time showed pic
tures of a car worth about $1,400, the
actual model was wrfth in the neigh
borhood of $800.
W. S. Reed, an engineer, was on
the stand the greater part of the aft
ernoon. ; '
Mr. Cummins spent considerable
time questioning Mr. Reed and
brought out testimony to show that
while the model car cost, according
to evidence, $2,000, other cars made
later ccst only about ?1,200, and that
quantity production .would have cost
considerably less. Mr. Reed aluo tes
tified that some objectionable fea
tures of the model car would have

Edward Tinlin, a mine superinten
dent of Des Moines, told of buying

he had distributed some copies of

H. D. Lambourne, a Pan represen
tative, tried to induce him to make a
trip to St.. Cloud to see tne company
plant, after he had been subpoenaed
in the present trial, he said. . Lam
bourne told him that it would not cost
him a cent, he testified, and was
very insistent that he go. He, how
ever, refused.
Mr. Tinlin testified that H. E.

Wilful Negligence

Cause of Suffering
In Army Hospital
CAMP SHERMAN, Ohio, Nov. 3
Charges that wilful negligence on the
part of steilrafitters employed In the
construction of the base hospital at
Camp Sherman resulted in exposure
for weeks to the zero weather preval
ent in October and all of November,
1917, of sick soldiers confined there,
were among the disclosures made be
fore the congressional subcommittee
by Joseph Poole, Chillicothe contrac
tor, late today. This evidence will be
followed up to fix responsibility for
suffering of the men, according to
Chairman John C. Mackenzie, and
Chief Examiner Roscoe C. McCulloch,
cf the committee. While sick soldiers
were pinched and actually blue to
their finger tips with the bitter cold,
steamfitters supposedly equipping the
hospital wards with sresm neni were
gambling and warming themselves
over their gasoline torches, Poole told
the committee. He asserted that the
weather was so cold the nurses wore
'furs when they tended the sick, and
.the doctors wore their sheepskin-lined
coats, and the patients had no heat

HELENA, Ark., :N6v. 3. Rapid
progress marked the trials today of
cases growing out of the recent race
disturbances south ofi the city, one
negro being convicted of first de
gree murder after eight minutes de
liberation by a circuit court jury
and five others receiving a verdict
of guilty to a similar charge, all at
the same time, after - the jurymen
had been out seven xainutes. The
verdict means electrocution for the

In the first of the two cases

they saw Hicks fire the shots the
morning of October 1, which re

an ex-soldier of this city. The de

as a result of the disorders. '
Evidence" brought out by the pro
secution showed the existence of a
post of the "Progressive Farmers
and Household Union of America,"
the organization under which it is
alleged the negroes were banded for
the uprising at Elaine, near where
the disturbances took place the first
week in October, resulting in the
death of white persons and a large,
number of negroes and the wound
ing of others.
Several witnesses for the state
related how they joined "the Elaine
post within ten days before the
disturbances began and were told
to bring arms to meetings "because
the union expected trouble if the
whites tried to break up its meet
ing." That the union had a large fol
lowTng in the Elaine neighborhood
was brought out in the testimony
of George Green, a negro appearing
for the state in the case of Frank
Hicks, charged with the killing of
Clinton Lee. Green said he attended
the meetings of the union in a

Probably the first well ever drilled

The company., was so successful-and
the cost of operation was so small
that the Empire is understood to have

MR. GOMPERS AND HIS ENEMIES
Oil a long time Mr. Samuel Gompers has been a bulwark or
numeration p.nd conservatism,' as well as a constructive force,
in the labor movement. The American Federation of Labor
had become a great influence and power under his prudent
and wise direction. Enemies within it and outside of it he has had
to struggle against: Socialists, extreme radicals, revolutionaries, syn
dicalists, advocates of political action by a distinct Labor party,
enthusiasts of "direct action, I. W. W.'s with their "one big union"
and their miseellanous program of mischief, says the New York
Times. , -
Of late the enemies within seem to have won an insidious vic
tory. Younger and rasher leaders prevail. It appears from Mr.
Easley's letter in the Times of yesterday that Mr. Gompers has lost
bis old, deserved authorify. It is but a shadowy pre-eminence that
he maintains by words, orders, actions inconsonant with the saga
cious and fruitful policies that have made his. name so great, so
respected, here and abroad. The Federation has fallen on evil days.
The I. W. W. is "boring from within." , Unauthorized strikes, 62 ou
of 70 recent ones, according to the I. W. W. counsel, Margolis, testiry
to the mutinous spirit and" contempt of authority growing- in its
ranks. Mr. Gompers seems able to assume an authority that has
passed, or is passing away from him, only by yielding to the ex
tremists. On the day of the regrettable withdrawal of Mr. Gompers
and the labor group from the Industrial Conference the Illinois Fed
eration or Labor urged him to call a special convention of the Ameri
can Federation at Washington. The railroad brotherhood repre
sentatives were to be invited. The object of the convention was "an
offensive and defensive alliance of the international unions of the
United States and Canada, and the railroad brotherhoods, more ef
fectively to fight out the life and death struggles of the workers now
in progress and impending." The Illinois Federation attacked "the
SC?el Trust" for its methods for control in the steel strike. "Too
long has labor permitted these -tyrants to keep the workers on the
defensive." The country knows who caused the steel strike. It
knows that it is essentially a strike of foreigners against Americans,
that it is largely conducted by alien agitators, by Bolshevist propa
gandists. At GaryYV. W. cards are numerous among the foreign
strikers. Reds and Red literature abound. The overthrow of the
government and the "bourgeoisie," .the establishment of a Soviet
State, are advocated in many languages. An I. W. W. with a Fed
eration card, a "borer from within," is found. Mr. Gompers complies
wit hthe request of the Illinois sympathizers, with a strike ordered
and managed by his enemies, by many enemies of the United States.
He calls a conference of 112 heads of unions affiliated with the Fed
eration. They are to discuss "present and impending disputes."
The railroad brotherhoods, the farmers, the labor organizations of
Canada will be asked to co-operate. Labor is at the peak of pros
perity. Wages were never so high. Hours are short. The contem
porary strike is for power, not on account of grievances. If there
is a death-and-life struggle of the workers now- in progress, it is in
the unions themselves, in the Federation of Labor. Will the labor
unions, having gained and grown enormously, following American
policies and sustained by public opinion, throw away all their ad
vantages, make "public opinion their enemy, adopt foreign ideas and
methods? Flushed with long triumph, penetrated by alien and sin
ister influences, substituting a class interest for a broad, general
American obligation and patriotism, will they seek to impose their
autocratic will upon the country? If they do, they are doomed. They
will be crushed against the majority of Americans. More than that,
they will fall to pieces because the majority of their members are
Americans, used to moderation, common sense, orderly methods,
disgusted with imported syndicalism, "direct action," Bolshevism,
anarchism.
Only the labor unions can injure labor unionism. Mr. Gomper3
tan expect no mercy from the radicals who distrust or hate him.
Hot t or for his fame, better for the Federation, that he should put
his back to the wall, light, not surrender; try to keep the'Federatlou
American.
RESPONSIVE GOVERNMENT
w
have always had an idea that we had a pretty responsive gov
ernment, one touched at all. times by the people, and likely
to sway at the touch. But our government is not nearly as
resnonsive as the British government, as we may have ob
served last week, says the. Arizona Republican. A week ago tomorrow
right the powerful government of Lloyd George was threatened with
overthrow on account of a trifling incident in which there seemed
to be but little popular concern. The question was whether French
cross-channel pilots entering British ports should be granted certifi
cates in return for similar privileges granted to British pilots enter
ing French ports.
This was no unusual incident. Crises have often been brought
about in the British government by incidents equally unimportant,
but in this case if happened to be brought to our notice. For the
last four or five years we have been observing British procedure more
closely than we formerly did.
If our government were as sensitive as the British government
is. wc would now be at a crisis and the country would be getting
ready to vote on Hie question whether the president or congress
should lie sustained as to their widely varying altitude on war time
prohibition, for that is a far more it al and interesting matter than
the French pilot question.

AN ODE TO HENRY
They i oared away from the " starter's flag.
Those attios, big and little;
With never a fear of the' outcome then.
Nor caring a Jot or tittle.
They swung around wheie the ruts'are deep,
And the rocks are rough as sin,
And when the big ones found the ditch,
The lords came romping in!
, Tlisy skirled ihe edge of canyon walls
They plowed through the bed of streams
They heard the pop of bursting tires
And a burnt-out engine's screams.
And the big ones dropped in the thoroughfares
And died in their youthful prime.
But the Fords romped by with a merry laugh
And rambled home -on time!

HOSEHOLD REMEDIES.
That many medicines, such as
spirits of peppermint, camphor, and
ginger, which are frequently used as
household remedies, fail of their
purpose, is accounted for by the
great variation in the strength and
purity of many of these preparations
as sold in the market. There is con
siderable variation in the strength
of many of the common remedies
used in the household.
It is also true that the loss of hu
man energy through sickness and i
deaths from preventable' diseases
constitute by far the greatest waste
of our present day resources and that
it is not generally appreciated that
this waste is due either to neglect
or ignorance so far as the use of
porphylactic or curative measures
may be concerned.
A table presenting a compilation
from the reports of state chemists
shows that of 3472 samples of ten
official articles that are widely used
as household remedies, 1259. or 38
per cent, were rejected as adulter
ated, or not in compliance with the
official requirements.
The preparations included in these
tables are more frequently used as
household remedies than on the pte-

Dommes, adjutant, who is reading a telegram just brought by the ex-kaiserin announcing
the forthcoming visit of the ex-crown prince his first visit' to his parents since the exile
of German royalty. At the right the ex-kaiser is walking in a secluded path at the gard

and figure of the ex-monarch the untrimmed Vandyke beard and long whitened hair,
with sack suit felt hat and walking stick replacing the gold-and-gray uniform and sword
of the once powerful warlord.

I.EHSHIP OF
HOUSE SCORED
BV DEMOCRAT
WASHINGTON, Nov. 3 An attack
on the Republican leadership of the
house, made today during debate by
Representatie Aswell, Democrat of
Louisiana, was followed by a two-hour
partisan political fight centering
about a parliamentary effort to ex
punge the remarks. After denying
the statements of the Democratic
member. Representative Mondell,
Wyoming, Republican floor leader,
withdrew his motion to eliminate the
objectionable remarks and the house
adjourned until Wednesday.
Mr. Aswell declared that Mr. Mon
dell had refused to permit him to
have time to address the Jiouse be
cause the Republican leader knew
that the Democratic member "wanted
to reveal the rotten leadership of the
Republican party in tne house." Mr.
Aswell also asserted that Mr. Mondell
knew that he wished to "expose the
partisanship manifested" by a house
war investigating committee.
Replying, the Republican leader de
nied that he ever attempted to block
free discussion of any subject, adding
that he did not have the "slightest
idea? about the nature or the Louis
iana member's proposed speech. His
objection, he said, was solely in the
interest of saving time so the house
might conduct important business.
Later Mr. Aswell explained that he

The square neckline slit at! each corner is unusual. It is collarless
and is simjily bound with self material. The embroidered panel which
fall slightly over the belt in front, gives a suggestion of the always pop

I ' ' READY ROOF'NGS J
Are Made to Last i
Most ready roofings look the same but they
vary greatly in quality. The actual test of
service must be made before you can tell the
difference between good and poor ready
roofing.
Ru-ber-oid and Malthoid have proved their
merits under every condition. They have
stood the teat of time and weather because tha
finest quality is built into them.
In their manufacture, only long-fibred, tough
felt is used. Thin felt, which is made in the
company's own plant, is saturated with
asphaltum of just the right consistency to pre
serve the fibres. Then the whole is coated '
with a special weather-resisting compound.
Ru-ber-oid and Malthoid, the finished products,
have an exceptionally long life, are fire-resistant
and will not dry out or rot.
Standing back of Ru-ber-oid and Malthoid
quality is the great organization of The Paraffins
Companies, Inc. Every process of manu
facture, from the gathering of the rags for the
felt to the turning out of the finished roofing,
is carried on within the one organization. This
fact, and constant supervision by experts,
make it certain that the quality of Ru-ber-oid
and Malthoid is always maintained.
It is this careful choice of materials and
precision of manufacture which have made
Ru-ber-oid and Malthoid the recognized stand
ards of ready roofing.

EEUNfi ARRIVES IN BISBEE;
DOUGLAS UN WILL REFEREE
TUESDAY, NOVEMBER 4. 1919.
ORT REALM
Two events of interest to the fistic
fans of Cochise county happened yes
terday when Johnnie Celmars, who
meets Russell Chambers of Douglas
in the main event, arrived in Bisbee
to complete his training for Friday
night's bout, and when O. S. French,
iranager of the Bisbee Athletic club,
announced that Al Williams, who has
been third man in the ring at Douglas
for several months, would referee the
fights here.
Celmars is in the pink of condition,
and is oloking forward to his match
with Chambers with apparently all
the composure in the world. He has
been in training since leaving here,
after his fight with Frank Loughery,
and needs only a few days to accus
tom himself to the climate. He ex
pressed himself last evening as being
. confident that he will master the
Smelter City pride on Friday evening.
His manager. Bob Sweeney, will be
hf-re Thursday.
Williams, who will referee all the
bouts here or. Friday night, has won
the confidence of the Douglas fans by
his fair-mindedness and wealth of ex
perience. He acted as referee in some
of the most important army bouts
staged during the war, and. has a rep
utation for allowing men to fight
when they want to mix tnlngs. His
work in the Smelter City has been of
Buch a caliber that it is probable that
Warren district fans will see him
often as referee for Manager French,
as it is believed that the latter's
choice as third man could not have
been better. The decision, as in the
last fight, will be made by two Judges,
and the referee will have nothing to
do with the award, excepting in case
of a disagreement among the latter,
when he will make the decision. In
this fight, Celmars will choose one
judge and Chambers the other, this
plan having been made a part of the
articles which the men signed. The
names of the judges will be an
nounced at the ringside, as neither
fighter has yet made known nis
choice.
. Kid eGorge, the 160-pound fighter,
who is now making his home in Bis
bee, and who has gone to Douglas to
supervise the training of Cnambers
for the fight, has sent several letters
to friends in Bisbee, among them
Manager French, from which the fol
lowing extracts are taken:
"Chambers was waiting for me to
day. We went five hard rounds, and,
besides, he was on the bag for three
rounds, jumped rope and finished
with the pulleys. He will have no
trouble with the weight at 145 pounds.
He is a better boy than I thought he
was. There will no doubt be a large
bunch from Douglas in Bisnee on
November 7.
"Russell is in nice shape right now,
and his go with Celmars is going to
be some battle. The fans here are
all taking much interest in the go,
and you may expect a large delega
tion. I think that Celmars is going to
find that he will have to step to keep
up with Chambers when the going
gets good."
The advance sale of tickets Tras be
gun yefeterday, and from every
where the tickets were placed, re
ports came in to Manager French
that they were going better than for
any other fight staged here in recent
motnhs. At the same time, betting
has been brisk, with plenty of Cham
bers money in eight, as well as cash
belonging to friends of Celmars. In
fact, Celmars money was going beg
ging yesterday, many fans giving hira
the preference because of his exper
ience and courage, to which they add
ed the staying powers that dis
tinguished him In his fight with
Loughery.

Two Major League
. Jlanagers Content
With 1920 Players
BY FRED TURBYVILLE.
N. E. A. Sports Writer.
Pat Mora and Tris Speaker can
go ahead and enjoy the winter league
season without worrying about the
future. Both managers will -likely
stand pat on their 1919 lineups for
the 1920 races. And a lot of fans
and other baseball men are expect
ing the Reds and the Indians to
fight it out in the big series next
fall.
All the way through Moran's team
looks good. It Is a winning ' com
bination that showed lots of fight
and teamwork for the 1919 season
and why should Moran experiment
with changes for 1920? None of his
men is sd old that a crack in the
team is feared.
At Cleveland Tris Speaker has
a corking good catching staff, a fast
and steady infield and an outfield
that ranks well with any other in
the game. There is only one de
partment that may see a change
the pitching staff. There are too
many on the staff now and some
may be dropped. Speaker also may
procure a ood ieft-hander before
the start of the 1920 grind.
Al Swindle, Boxing
Promoter, Lives Up
To Name Is Charge
' Swindle a swindler? Goshamighty,
no!
But it is claimed that it is even so,
cays the Verde Copper News of Je
rome. At any rate a charge of swind
ling has been placed against Al Swin
dle, the Kingman boxer promoter,
who recently brought Newton Good
win here for the trimming Goodwin
eceived at the hands of Tony Yescas.
The proprietor of the Bee notel, at
Kingman, is the complainant. He al
leges that Swindle paid his hotel bill
with a check that was not backed up
by funds in bank.
Swindle wa Barrested at Humboldt,
where he was arranging a boxing
vard for Noember 5. After a day or
two in the county jail at Prescott, he
was taken back to Kingman by a Mo
have officer
8PEAKER HASN'T
SIGNED PAPER
This Speaker hasn't signed a 1920
contract to manage the Iidians but
that isn't causing any worry in Cleve
land or with Jim Dunn, the owner.
Dunn and Speaker are such good
friends that Tris' word is good
enough for Jim. And there Is an
understanding between the two.
The signing of a contract by
Speaker is a mere formality neces
sary because of the rules of the
game, said Dunn. "I must have one
to send in to the league. Otherwise
1 wouldn't ask Tris to sign a paper
for his word is good enough for
me."
TO FREE ROOMS OF
UNPLEASANT ODORS.
Sick-rooms or other rooms of the
house are sometimes filled with un
pleasant odors and not very fresh
ened. To remove such odors try
putting a small lump of ammonia
in the bottom of a pint Jar. Add
a few drops of any good perfume
and let ammonia absorb the per
fume. Then pour in teacupful of
"boiling water and the steaming frag
ranee will sweeten the air.

STOCKS AND BONOS
NEW YOHK, Nov. 3. Trading in
stocks today was again active and
broad, but the undertone suggested a
degree of caution such as frequently
characterized a session sandwiched
between two holidays.
There was a big demand for call
money, as all loans made hold until
the middle of the week. The opening
rate of 10 per cent ruled until just
before the close, when a few loans
were reported at as low as 5 per cent.
In its main essentials the market
traversed the ground made ' familiar
by last week's extensive operations,
steels and allied equipments once
more leading their advances with
leather, tobucco. paper and food
shares. Oils also had their periods of
activity, the demand for Sinclair at
times being so large as to excite com
ment. Gains among oils and affiliated
issues ranged from 2 to 5 pomts, sub

LIGHT OF
A NEW DAY
.
Pacific Coast Field Committee
of Y. W. C. A. Holds a
3-Day Conference.
Someone has said that th wai
threw a searchlisht on women
a light that penetrated to the egg
money in the cracked teapot; to th
flour barrel and the sugar jar.
This searchlight has not been r
moved but still illuminates th plac
that women have won by their imitec"
and devoted service. Wherever th
energy of women was directed, tc
nursing the sick, conserving food
carrying on campaigns of thrift oi
caring for women in camps and can
tonments, the unity of effort brought
effective results.
The war ban brought new needs
and developed new problems de
manding earnest effort and cleai
thinking for their solution. Th
changing industrial conditions, th
emerging from restricted .environ
ment, especially in foreign lands re
quire serious thought and wise treat
ment. The Young Women's Christian As
sociation having; its organized work
extending over 'our own land and
reaching, out to Europe, Asii
and South America, realises its re
sponsibility' to these world problem!
and is planning to meet these post
war needs in an adequate fashion.
As a part of the association's pro
gram of reconstruction the Pacific
Coast Field Committee of the Touns
Women's Christian Association called
a conference in San Francisco on Oc
tober 25, 26 and 27, to which two
hundred women, representing various
districts and interests of Arir.ona,
California, Nevada and the Hawaiian
Islands were invited. The attention
of these women was directed to the
thought of international responsibil
ity and to the urgent demands and
insistent calls coming from other
lands for the work of which they
Tiave heard and which they are un
able to initiate for themselves.
Among the prominent speakers at
this conference were Miss Harriet
Taylor, who acted as Executive Sec
retary in France during the war and
bad charge the training school
which sent out workers to meet th
needs of war work over there. She
spoke from a wide peri3ace and
extensive Knowledge of vork accom
plished and needs to be met. Miss
BertJ'a Conde, recently returned
from a survey of South America,
and sn!or student of the National
Association,'- presented In vivid
fashion the needs of women in our
sister rppublics. Here women are
Just coming into Industry and the
problems arising from the sudden
transition perplex them sorely and
lead them to look north for help
and eneouregement.
Miss Louise Holmquist, executive
of the Department of Research and
Method, had a distinct message
which she delivered with great
earnestness and charm. Her knowl
edge cf the needs of women Is pro
found and -her interest and enthu
Biasm are' contagious.
Mrs. Eddy, from her wide knowl
edge of foreign lands, explained the
calls for work in these fields ane"
told ef the cooperative relation be
tween the missionary workers and
the Young Women's Christian As
sociation. This conference marked the
launching of an educational program
which is to be carried on simulta
neously over the United States. The
program aims to secure th Interest
and aid of all those who are "capable
f thinking; in internal fop.sl terms
and of living with courage, wisdom
and fidelity In international rela
tions." . ;
Hostels fcr French University
Women Students.
- i i
The French univprsities for the
coming academic yar will continue
to show traces of the American In
vasion. The American Youne Wo
men's Christian Association is co
operating r.ith the Students' Feder
ation in establishing homes for girls
In a half dozen of the university
towns In France. It is not expected
that these hostels will accommodate
all the' university girls in any one
center'. They might before th
war, when higher education for girls
was not' universally approved. But,
out cf the experiences of the war,
a much larger enroHment has en
sued. It !s precisely because of the
difficBl'.ies of living conditions that
the Y. W. C. A. Is cooperating la
this work.
Th Worm" Younic Women's j
Christian Association will hold aj
Ve-k of Prayer beginning Sunday,;
November 9th, for the Spirit of j
Christ In the world today.
Thp fufire for Y. W. C. A. work
In cities and towns is a hn'kht one.

WHAT MAKES AN IDEAL HUSBAND?
"LOYALTY," VOTES DORIS KENYON
WHAT KIND OF MEN MAKE
THE BEST HUSBANDS?
Today Miss Doris Kenyon, whose
matrimonial difficulties maka the
plot of "The Girl in The Limou
sine," gives her answer.
Miss Diana Paton, starring in
"Oh, What a Girr,- wHi give her
answer tomorrow.
By DORIS KENYON
There is one quality above all
otlurs that I think an ideal husband
must possess, and that Is, loyalty. It
Is the one think that women, through
ages and ages of evolution, have in
stinctively demanded and attempted
to secure from men. Many and many
a woman modern as well as ancient
has stood for beatings, for ill-treat-jiient,
for drunkenness, for all sorts of
shortcomings in a husband, so Ion?
a s she knew that the husband in ques
tion was absolutely loyal to her. Dis
loyalty the broken marriage vow is
the one thing that women will not for
give, and they are quite right.
The integrity of the rsfbe Is built
upon loyalty of one man to one wo
man in marriage. Not only for the
sake of her own health and that of
tor children, but for the deeper satis
faction ot her own woman nature, a
wife must demand loyalty of her hus
band. Whea he steps across the line,
sr.arriage in any real sense, ceases to
exist. The woman is right who re
fuses absolutely to condone the of
fense of disloyalty on the part of her
husband.
I think the quality of LOYALTY in
a husband should be put first of all.
HOUSEHOLD REMEDIES.
That many medicines, such as
spirits of peppermint, camphor,
and ginger, which are frequently
used as household remedies, fail of
their purpose, is accounted for by
the great variation in the strength
and purity of many of these prepara
tions as sold in the market There
Is considerable variation in the
strength of many ot the common
remedies used in the household.
It is also true that the loss of hu
man energy through sickness and
deaths from preventable diseases
constitute by far the greatest waste
of our present day resources and
that it is not generally appreciated
that this waste is due either to neg
lect or ignorance so far as the use
of prophylactic or curative measures
may be concerned.
A table presenting a compilation
from the reports of state chemists
shows that of 3472 samples of ten
official articles that are widely used
as household remedies, 1259, or 38
per cent, were rejected as adulter
ated, or not in Compliance with the
official requirements.
The preparations included in these
tables are more frequently used as
household remedies than on the pre
scription of physicians, but are nev
ertheless recognized medicines, the
abuse or misuse of which may lead
to serious consequences.
A more energetic and active con
trol ot all drugs and preparations Is
needed. The desirable and only ef
ficient method of control involves
honesty, knowledge, vigilance and
care on the part of the person sell
ing the product.
Members of boards of health and
other state and federal officials en
trusted with the enforcement of laws
designed to control the purity and
strength or medicinal products should
call attention to the -desirability of
having these laws enforced in a way
to secure for the purchaser of drugs
of uniform strength and purity with
a view ot minimising as much as
possible the untoward or secondary
effects of potent medicines irrespec
tive of whether they are used as
household remedies or under the di
rect' supervision of a competent phy
sician. Bonillas Boosted
For Next President
WASHINGTON, Nov. 3. Advices
from Mexico City today told of a
proposal under consideration there
to send a commission at once to
Washington to ask Ambassador Bo
nillas to accept the nomination of
the Third party for the presidency,
to succeed Venustiano Carranza. The
acceptance indicated that the Car
ranza administration would support
Ambassador Bonillas against General
Alvaro ' Obregon and General Pablo
Gonzales, the military men whose
candidacies have already been an
nounced officially.
It was thought that President Car
ranza would support Gonzales, but a
canvass of the country Is said to
have developed that the general had
been unable to muster any appre
ciable strengthvand that there was a
strong sentiment throughout the
country against any military candidate.

What Warren District Women Think
The Ideal Husband Should Do and Be
LITTLE THINGS THAT COUNT. .
Lowell, Nov. 3.
Editor Review:
An ideal husband should be unsel
fish, sacrificing and loyal, of course.
But it is the little things in lire
that count for happiness in married
life. Women usually weep barrels of
tears the first few years of married
life just because of little misunder
standings.
An ideal husband should be kind
and even a bit affectionate. A kind
word or a pleasant look makes sun
shine in the home. If wife drops a
plate and breaks it, an ideal husband
would not say, as I heard one say, "I
wish our plates, were made of tin."
Women would like their husbands to
look pleasant if supper isn't ready
and waiting for them the minute
they get home. Wifie doesn't want
to be blamed if the change runs out
before payday in these days of

WIFE SHOULD BE PARTNER.
Bisbee, Nov. 3.
Editor Review:
In these bright days of "woman's
emancipation." the true husband
should give his wife an insight into
his business affairs, so that she may
be a real partner and helpmeet. Mu
tual confidence makes for mutual
esteem and love,, a closer and durable
bond with which to weather the long
years of matrimony. The husband
has a say in the upbringing of the
children; why shouldn't the wife be
at least a sympathetic adviser in
business affairs ,and cares? Don't
let the husband think for a moment
that the average, wife of today is not
capable of , intelligent ,help in busi
ness, whether it be of office, factory
or store. The, day of . the .helpless,
clinging woman is in. the past, and
the ideal husband realizes this and
pays just tribute to his wife's intelli
gence. The wife , of today resents
being shut out from her husband's
business world as if she were of
inferior mentality.
A BUSINESS WOMAN.
"AIN'T NO SUCH ANIMAL."
Warren, Nov. 3.
Editor Review:
I can't see the sense In all this
fuss about the ideal husband, when
no such being exists. Any girl who
pursues such an i8ea is destined
eventually to be bitterly disappoint
ed, or to die an old maid. I myself
was too idealistic on the subject in
my youth; I waited too long, expect
ed too much, and I would hate to tell
you what I finally drew when ad
vancing years forced me to seize a
forlorn chance or be left out of the
marriage mart altogether. My ad
vice to young girls is to demand in
a husband fidelity, honesty and an
affectionate disposition, and not to
be too finicky about minor faults.
Every normal man has at least halt
a dozen. DISILLUSIONED.

OBJECTS TO "FIRESIDE HUBBY."

Editor Review:
My Idea of the ideal husband is one
who keeps up the ardor and romance
of courtship after marriage. We all
recall the story of the married man
Who replied in surprise, when it was
suggested that he was remiss in dis

"Why. you wouldn't run after a street

you?" I believe that the fireside

Jiggerville, Nov. 3.
Editor The Review:
"What makes an ideal husband?"
I have read with interest every ar
ticle written by both the women of
national fame and local women, and
have reached the conclusion that all
of the writers have been approach
ing the question from their personal
standpoint. Should it not be put this
way? What will make an ideal hus
band for me? There you have it.
When a young girl rushes blindly
into matrimony without considering
the characteristics of the man with
whom she has chosen to live "until
death do you part" she is apt to
make a mistake in her selection that
will later cause many a heartache.
Of course, many couples are wed and
live happily even though this great
question has never been considered.
That Is merely accidental good for
tune. Therefore I say that when
choosing a husband a girl should
look for a man with all of the char
acteristics, or at least a good many
of them, that she lacks. Oppositcs
frequently attract each other and
should these affairs always termi
nate in marriage the divorce courts
would soon be out of business.
