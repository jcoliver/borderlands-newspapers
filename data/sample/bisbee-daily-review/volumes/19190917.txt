CHARGE OF SEN.
Overflow Audience Hears California Senator, in Same Hall
Where President Pleaded for Treaty, Assail the League of
Nations Pact as Wilson Attempt to Supersede Declaration
' of Independence With Vassalage to the Powers of Europe
SIOUX FLLS, S. D., Sept. 16.
Speaking before a large audience here
tonight. Senator Hiram W. Johnson
of California, charged that President
Wilson seeks to establish substan
tially a new government for the
United States by the provisions of
the league of nations covenant.
Senator Johnson's stirring appeal
for the radical amendment of th
peace pact was enthusiastically re
ceived by the crowd.
Upon his arrival here, he was met
at the train by a band and a commit
tee of citizens, and later rode in an
automobile parade. He spoke from
the same platform where President
"Wilson urged . the adoption of the
league of nations covenant, eight days
ago in his swing through the west.
. Crowd Is Forced To Stand
To accomodate the crowd it was
necessary to remove the chairs fromf
the main floor of the hall and the
crowd remained standing while the
senator spoke.
Among those on the stage were
Mayor George W. Burnside, W. C.
Cook, Republican national committee
man from South Dakota and former
Senator Robert K. Gamble.
The Bpeaker was introduced by
Charles M. Day.
"Mr. .Wilson told you: 'So what I
want to point out to you is that we
are making a fundamental choice off
government. You may adopt a gov
ernment in which Germany is pictur
ed as a perfect flower or you must
have a new system, " said Senator
Johnson.
Declaration Independence Still Good
"This Is exactly what Mr. Wilson
intends to do with his league of na
tions, adopt a new government sub
stantially for the United States of
America. It is exactly what we do
not wish to have done. We do not
Tequire a new government at this
time. We are content to live under
the constitution and the Declaration
of Independence.
"We insist that the government ot
Washington and of Lincoln and of
Roosevelt, the republic which yrm
have cherished and which has grown
great under the doctrine of Ameri
canism, shall not be superseded by
Senate to Reveal U.
WASHINGTON,. Sept. 16. Prac
tically the entire "file of correspond
ence between the Mexican and Amer
ican governments, is it expected,
will become a part of the records
of the senate foreign relations sub
committee investigating the Mexi
can situation.
Chairman Fall of the sub-committee
disclosed today in the course
of his examination of Frederick
Watrous, an attorney representing
oil and land interests in Mexico,
that the committee had asked the
state department to produce pro
tests made by the United States to
Mexico's ' answers and -such other
correspondence and documents as
might serve to clarify the situation.
Senator Fall added that he knew
of no reason why the department
would withhold any information at
its disposal, but that a part of it.

an overlordship of eight foreign na
tions or by a super-government . in
which our voice will be but one of
nine. In this ominous sentence, Mr.
Wilson has told his purpose and the
purpofee of the league of nations. He
has outgrown the government that
has been ours for 40 years. x We
have not. He has made 'a funda
mental choice of a government with
his league. We are still Americans.
Where Is Wilson's "Report?"
"Mr. Wilson in starting his tour
said' he was making a 'report' to the
country. The American people have
waited in vain for any report of Mr.
Wilsons proceedings at Paris. In
stead of facts, they have had plati
tudes and glittering generalities.
They have been given no explanation
for the surrender of the principles so
often eloquently announced by Mr.
Wilson, no reason for the abandon
ment of Americanism and the easy
triumph of European and Asiatic
diplomacy.
"In this city of Sioux Falls, .Mr.
Wilson indulged in one or two sig
nificant remarks, pregnant with
warning to our people. 'Your choice,'
he said, is between the league of na
tions and Germanism,' and he en
deavored by veiled threat to convey
that his opponents were tainted with
pro-Germanism. It is a bad and lost
cause which in its extremity resorts
to epithets and vituperation.
League or Americanism, Issue
"And the choice is not between the
league of nations and Germanism.
The choice is between the league of
nations and Americanism. The choice
is between Mr. Wilson's internation
alism, which subordinates and sub
jects Americanism to European and
Asiatic power, and Americanism.
"Mr. Wilson asserted to you that
the treaty of pence laid down forever
the principle that no territory ever
should be governed except as the
people who live there want it gov
erned. Th' millions of subject peo

WHEELER TIES
Former sheriff Harry C. Wheeler,
who was Monday in the Douglas
court bound over for trial on a
charge of kidnapping at 1ub' own re
quest, again assumed full responsibil
ity yesterday for the deportations of
J my izth, 1917, which have resulted
in approximately 375 citizens of the
Warren district and Douglas being
bound over to the supferlor court.
Commenting on the statement ot
the county attorney, made in court
Monday, that the charge could have
been .dismissed without ODnosItlon
from the prosecution, Wheler said
that:
"I insisted upon being bound over
for trial on the kidnapping charge be
cause I am the man responsible for
the deportations. The countv attor
ney said there was no evidence to
snow thot I had any connection with
the affair. . It seems to me that ihe
proclamation I issued, as sheriff, on
July 12, 1917, annovfhclng that I had
deputized hundreds of citizens and
assumed full responsibility for the
deportations, should be proof enough
that I did have considerable to. do
with the affair, and I think every
body in the southwest has read the
proclamation at sometime."
Wheelerdeclared that he was con
fident the actions of the citizens and
himself would be vindicated in the
superior court when all facts con
cerning the deportations were
brought to light.
"I sort of expected that the coun.
ty attorney would be willing to drop
the charge against me," said Wheel
er, "but I could not see it that way
at all. I want the superior court to
know exactly what happened on and
before July 12, 1917. and I think that
when we put our side of the case it
will appear in a different light to
many people who don't seem to un
derstand Just why this action was
taken. ,
"I have never denied my part la
the deportations. And I am willing
and wish right now that all the cltl
zens arrested and bound over so far
would be released and me alone be
held to trial for any wrong that might
be charged. The majority of citizen
who took part In the deportations
were my deputies and whatever they
did was in the discharge of their
duties as deputy sheriffs In my
Jurisdiction."
Wheeler expectB to leave town for
a few days but upon his return, will
make his residence In Douglas.
The case of Jeff Dunnegan of
Douglas, which was to have been
heard this afternoon was postponed
until tomorrow afternoon on account
of the failure of Dunnegan to reach
this city from El Paso yesterday.
Several other cases remain to be
disposed of, Including the charge of
kidnapping against W. Mitchell, mine
superintendent of the Four C's prop
erty at Cananea, Sonora. The coun
ty attorney stated today that he

"Joy-riding," speeding, disregard of
congested conditions of traffic and
all the other motor evils to which
crowded city streets are heir.
The ordinance is in 38 sections.
and so carefully and minutely drawn
as to avoid all possible chance of
shrewd, technical misinterpretation.

of not less than $10 nor more than
$100,. or imprisonment in the Bis
bee Jail for a period of five to ten
days, or both such fine and impris

nor more than 90 days for the sec
ond offense.
The speed limits are set at 6
miles per hour over or across any
street intersection In the congested
district, or 12 miles an hour over
the streets of the congested district,
or 15 miles an hour outside of the
congested district.
Among some of the regulations
provided are the stopping at least
15 feet from a street car while the
passengers are getting on or off;
stopping near fire hydrants and at
curbs; hours for lights; prohibit
ing 'the leaving of an auto engine
running; prohibiting the driving of
cars by children under 16 years of
age; regulations as to traffic ob
struction. The ordinance applies not only to

vehicle, all of which are , carefully
defined.

ADAMS: LIE DIRECT IS RESPONSE
War, Breaking Yesterday Over Retention of Engineer Ryan
By Commission, Waxes Hot as Supervisor Adams Charces
Agreement Broken, While Commissioner Marks Flatly De
nies Such Agreement Made: Point of What Right the Su
pervisors Had to Try to Influence Commission's Act Raised
The war is on between the Board of Supervisors
l eaded by Roberts and Adams and the new highway
commission recently appointed by them.
The lie has been passed bv the two factions. Chair
r an I. C. E. 'Adams says the new commissioners are
double erossers, that J. C. -Ryan, former engineer, is
incompetent; that the new commission has given in to
pressure put on them bv Messrs. Bronhv. Oohrin.o- "PisTi-
er, and Xewman and have
ana nave agreed to his reporting solelv to them and not
to Syd Smith, the new engineer, in 'dirpt vinlntinn nf
jtheir specific and unanimous agreement as made and
."tca to them (Roberts & Adams) in the meeting held
Monday afternoon in Bisbee.
Emil Marks, of Lowell, member of the new highwav
commission, flatlv contradicts Supervisor Adams' state
ment and says that no such' .agreement was made with'
the supervisors, that if they are to be the new highwav
commission they are going to be the highway commis
sion, and further, the new commission has retained coun
sel and will see the thing through to the finish' and that
none of the members are going to quit, but will stick to
the finish'. Mr. Marks further stated that there had
absolutely been no agreement between the new commis
sioners and 'Adams and Roberts concerning Rvan, that
Ryan knows the game and that it is 'the advisable thing
to retain him and pay him for completing the work upon
wmcn ne is already engaged.
William Reay of Douglas stated last night that "I
feel like other members of the commission do. that T do
pot intend to be dictated to bv the Board of Supervis
ors." Further than this he declined to make a state
ment, saying that the commission would issue an offi
cial statement in the next day or so.
I. "W. "Wallace, chairman of the commission, stated
o The Review last nisrht that at. m'ospnf nnf -Pool
that he could make a statement, owing to an agreement.
re naa with other members
official statement was issued
Y. Smith of Pierce could
uie Keview. Colonel Fulghum, remaining member of
- commission, could not be reached at a late hour last
: light.
m Another interesting angle to the case is the ques-1
tion of whether the supervisors did not commit at least
a glaring irregularity if they, as thev sav thev did, made
an agreement with a supposedlv independent bodv. ap
pomted by them, as to the official acts of that 'bodv.
It is pointed out that the county highwav commis
sion is supposed to b'e entirely independent of ' the board
of supervisors, and is supposed to appoint its countv.
engineer without consulting the wishes of the board of
supervisors. It is supposed to be entirelv out of poli
tics. If the agreement admitted by the supervisors act
ually was made, it is pointed out further, then the super
visors were making appointment to a public body
contingent upon ! submission to an act demanded by the
appointive power outside its legal functions, to de
scribe which as a glaring irregularis would be a mild
way of putting it.
Special Commission Appointed
Some months ago the board of
supervisors, headed by Messrs. Rob
erts and Adams, appointed a special
county highway commission which
was to take charge of the plans for
the new million dollar bond Issue
and which was to serve concurrently
with the regular county highway
commission. This had to be aband
oned when the law prohibited Buch a
commission from acting legally. This
commission which was established the
latter part of April then lay dormant
until the regularly and legally ap
pointed commission's term expired.
The special commission first appoint
ed consisted of Messrs. Tackard.
Pickering. A. Y. Smith. Emil Marks
and Fulghum. At that time Ryan
was the engineer of the old commis
sion and upon the expiration of this
old commission, which consisted of
Messrs. Powen, Rock.Gardner, Sher
man and Clark the board of supervi
sors appointed Messrs. Wallace and
Reay to fill the vacancies occurring
by the resignation of Messrs. Fackard,
and Pickering. At the time of the ap
pointment of the commission on which
Messrs. Marks, , Smith and Fulghum
retained Rvan as engineer
of the commission, until an
bv all nf tlio mpmlwro A'
not be reached last night bv
were members. Supervisor Adams
stated last night that "It was distinctly
understood and agreed by the three
members of this commission. Messrs.
Marks, Smith and Fulghum that Ryan
was to go out with the old commission
and that Syd Smith was to be the new
new engineer 'and tha't any time that
this commission could not work In
harmony with the board of supervisors
In carrying out their wishes, then
those members were to resign upon
request.
"Double Cross" Is Charged
Further said Mr. AdamB last night,
"upon hearing that the new commission
had rouble-crossed us, I called up Mr.
Smith and asked him what he purpos
ed to do about it an refreshed Ms
memory with the understanding con
cerning the resignation. Mr. Smith
said he would let me know later. To
date I have heard nothing from him "
Continuing, Mr. Adams said: "When
the term of the old commission con
sisting of Messrs. Bowen, Clark. Gard
ner and Sherman, was ip, I saw each
of the remaining three members of
the commission which had been laying
domant and told them that It was the

Smith would be the new engineer
and we compromised with , them on
the Jlyan question owing to these in
flences which they "admitted had
been brought to bear, by allowing
Mr, Ryan 4o remain but it was dis
tinctly understood . that he . (Mr.
Ryan) was to work under Mr. Smith
and not report direct to the commis
sion and that in case Mr. Ryan did
not want to do this then he was not
to be retained. That was the way
the- matter stood and we (the board
of, .supervisors), thinking .thai these
men a3 stated, were men of , honor
And integrity and men of their word,
left the meeting and returned to
Tombstone only to be confronted the
next day with their actions in retain
ing Mr. Ryan in the position of en-
gineer and not responsible to Air.
Syd Smith, the new engineer."
When asked by the Review just
what action the board of supervisors
would take on the matter and wheth
er they would approve the bonds
which had been filed, but not yet ap
proved by the supervisors, as furnish
ed by the new commission, Mr. Ad
ams replied: . "What good, are their
bonds if their" word of honor is no
gcod, as .they hove proven by their
actions in violating their agreement
made to us
Must Approve Bonds
A prominent attorney when ques
tioned bythe Review last night
about the legal aspect of the affair
stated that until the bonds are ap
proved the old commission still -holds
as being the legal commission and
any action taken by them is legal,
and that in case the board of "super
visors did not approve the surety
bo ids written by a ' reliable bonding
company for the new commissioners,
they (the bending" company) had
grounds for damages against the su
pervisors in rejecting the bonds, that
in au probability- - the supervisors
WOuld be forced to accept the bonds,
and inasmuch as the equipment, rec
ords. etc., had already been turn
ed over by the old commission to the
new commission there was no other
course left tor the Supervisors but
to accept the-bonds on file. . .
The questions that the public is
now trying to decide on arc, who got
the lemon slipped to them, who is
he engineer, -who are the commiS'
pioners, have the. board t)f. supervisors
any business to attempt an agree
ment with a supposedly independent
commission, and where will it all
end? And the battle continues.
The full statement of Supervisors
Roberts. and Adams on the situation
fs as follows:'
- Board's Statement
"The Board of. Supervisors appoint-
p.,st in Cochise comity. The. Hoard I
of Supervisors' were very frank with'weH as I ever did in mv Jil'o.. Mv an-
charge of all highway work tor the

which he said were unconscionable,
make, his statement grotesque."
"After all, my friends, this
government doesn't belong to one
m man, even if he is the president.
It belongs to you and it belongs
to me; it belongs to your sons
and my sons. And if we go to
fight, I rebel and I revolt that
in this nation today the destines
of a hundred million people
should be in one man's hands,
who secretly, after promising us
again and again that secrecy
should' never obtain, secretly Is
disposing of your blood and mine.
I demand that you sons and
mine shall live, not. under a dic
tator, or a man who takes to him
. self the disposal of our blood in
secrecy, but under a constitution
and ' under laws that we our
selves shall make."
Senator Johnson left for Lincoln,
Nebraska, where he will speak to
morrow. Commission as well as the. county
work which would mean a good pav
ing to the taxpayers of Cochise coun
ty, and that all . people on the job
would be subordinate to him and
would report to him. The five mem
bers gave the board their assurances
that they could depend on this being
done. Along in the afternoon when
the board arrived in Tombstone they
found that the influences had re-exerted
-themselves and that four mem
bers of the commission . after notify
ing Mr. Smyth of his appointment
at his office in Tombstone by tele-
l phone, and asking him to come to
Bisbee, concluded to change their
minds and turn over all work to Mr.
Ryan.
"The board has kept it no secret
that they did not approve of the
work of Mr. ,Ryan at any time; they
were very free to express themselves
to the Commission who seemed to
share their views. The bonds of the
members of the new commission had
been filed with the clerk of the
board of supervisors at Tombstone,
however, the board of supervisors,
not having been in session since
these bonds were applied for, they
have not been approved. The board
feels.after conferring with the absent
members by phone, in justice to it
telf and to the people, of Cochise
county that they would not be justi
fied in approving these bonds.
"We feel that the members of the
commission- and' the board of super
visors should work in harmony; and
that those members of the commls
sion who after coming to an open
agreement with us as to who should
Ibe -highway engineer, should resign
and they assured us that they would
resign when they could not work in
harmony with the board.
. "While the papers have stated that
Mr. Smyth was appointed chief en
gineer and Mr. Ryan in charge of all
work, now under'-construction, they
did not state the fact that Mr. Smyth's
job . was an honorary one and car
ried no salary, and Mr. Ryan still re
tains his job at a salary of $5000 a
year."
THING ELSE

THIS IS WHAT MS. CAMPBELL
SAYS OF TAN LAC SUFFERED
SIX YEARS
i
' Of all ' the medicines and treat
ments I have taken during the pa.it
six years, Tanlac is the only thing that'
has done me any good at all," said
Mrs. Sadie Campbell, who lives at
1353 Geary street, San Francisco, Cal.,
the o; her. day..., "I had suffered so
mruch from stomacik irouole," contin
ued" Mis. Campbell, "that I was in a
very weak, run down condition. When
I began taking Tanlac I had such lit
tle strength and energy about me that
the least exertion would almost pros
trate me. Every time. J ate anything
I' would have bad. spells of indigestion
and what I ate wo.nl sour and cause
gas to form which had made me miser
able for hours afterwards. I had a dull
headache pearly, all the time. My
liver didn't seem to act we'll, either.
and I suffered a lot from billiousness,
and would often get so dizzy that 1
could hardly ijtand on my feet. My
nerves were 'in bad condition, too, and
I hardly, ever got a good night's 'sleep.
"Then 1 heard about Tanlac and
thought I would pive it a trial, and it
certainly proved to be a godsend to
me. I have only taken three, bottles
so far, but I feel like a different per

so well and strong that I can easily

The grand ball of the evening was
opened by a 25-piece Mexican band,
who gave way to a 6-piece orchestra
for the dancing which was a big
feature of the evening. - Tastefully
gowned and well trained they pleas
ed the immense throng with their
spirited rendering of the national
and patriotic airs of Mexico. A
vote of thanks was passed by the
officials of the Patriotic club, thank
ing the city officials for the use of
the park and the aid given them in

WHY WE WENT TO WAR
R
EVIEWING the circumstances under which this government
entered the war after having desperately tried to remain at
peace with Germany, President Wilson said at Helena on
Thursday night:
"We tried to persuade ourselves that European business was not
our business. We tried to convince ourselves that no matter what
happened on the other side of the sea, no obligation of duty. rested
upon us, and finally we found the currents of humanity too strong
for us, we found that a great consciousness was welling up in us
because this was not a local cause; that this was not a-struggle which
was to be confined to Europe or confined to Asia to which it had
already spread, but it was something that involved the very fate of
civilization, and there was one great nation in the world that couldn't
afford to stay out."
Is there any one who soberly believes that the foregoing is a
correct statement of the circumstances in which we went to war?
We all know that the thing that provoked us into the war was the
notification by Germany that we must keep off the seas except
within a clearly defined narrow and tortuous zone within which our
ships might travel under certain other conditions which were at the
same time to be imposed. If we departed from that zone or failed
to qbserve those conditions which Germany had imposed our ships
would be sunk. ,
So shameful was this ultimatum to us, that we were driven to
war, not for Europe, not for humanity, not for civilization, not for
democracy, but for our self respect and America. We had already
suf feted much in loss of self respect. We suffered first when the
Lusitania was sunk, and when after that American vessel after
American vessel was sent to the bottom. Each sinking was to
America a cause of war to whjch the people were ready to respond
but the government, to .the people's disgust, held back its response
through two shameful years.
Meanwhile German agents were more and more boldly plotting
in America. Another circumstance that has not yet been clearly
and publicly brought out is that at the time of German notification
of unrestricted submarine warfare, our state department was, and
had long been, in secret possession of information of. the German
plot to embroil this nation. inter ; was with Germany, Mexico and
Japan. Yet, the president before asking congress to declare a state
of war, protested against the ultimatum. If his protest had been
heeded, would our solicitude for Europe and humanity still have
led us into' war? We think not Why was that protest made if not
in the faint hope that we might be left a little longer in enjoyment
of our shameful peace? Arizona Republican.
AUSTRIA AT PEACE
FOR the first time since August, .1914, Austria is again at peace
with the world. The signature of the treaty , of peace by
Austria and the representatives of the allied powers put an
end to the war. Ratification is certain and will be almost
automatic.
Curiously enough, although it was the harsh demands of Austria
on Servia, after the assassination of the archduke at Sarajevo, that
started the war, there has been no disposition to put the war blame
on Austria. Germany's responsibility is practically undisputed.
Therefore, it being accepted that Austria merely took orders from
Berlin, there has been less rancor toward Austria than toward Ger
many. Also, Austrian troops conducted themselves with far less
brutalitv toward prisoners and civilian populations of invaded regions
than did the Germans. They showed more respect for international
law and the rules of civilized warfare. They were not perfect In
those regards, perhaps, but they stood out brightly against the black
German' background. That is the reason why the treaty signing at
St. Germain as more like a neighborhood gathering than a meet
ing of enemies to terminate hostilities. There was a spirit of near
friendliness in marked contrast to that which characterized tho
major event when Germany signed.
Austria emerges from the war. having won peace at the price of
most of her possessions. The great domain of the Hapsburg dynasty
has shrunk to small dimensions. What is left is hardly irore than
a province and its inhabitants, lealizing they are almost too weak
to be a nation, would like to be joined to Germany. The peace
treaty forbids but, if it could have been allowed to occur, the old
dual monarchy would have been wiped out entirely. Perhaps it is
more fitting that this weak skeleton of a nation should totter about
as a reminder and warning to the world.
THE DEADLY BREWS
SO NUMEROUS are the reports of fatalities from the use of de
natured and wood alcohol as beverages that the internal rev
enue bfireau has issued orders that all dealers who sell either
one must print upon the container the exact effect of these
liquids upon the human system.
Denatured alcohol cannot be safely used even for external pur
poses, and wood alcohol is still more dangerous if the greatest care
is not exercised to prevent inhaling the fumes or getting the alcohol
near the eyes.
Used as beverage, the effect of these liquids upon the human
system is to cause blindness, paralysis and death.
The person accustomed to his daily tipple may sometimes in
these thirsty days be heard to remark that he is dying for a drink.
If he takes either wcod or denatured alcohol, he may literally die
for his drink.
The world is so full of good things to eat, and to quench the
thirst, that the abnormal craving which leads to the consumption
of wild beverajces of unknown or doubt fol origin is a hint that the
imbiber may need mental treatment.
Attorney General Palmer, in one of his helpful moods a few
weeks ago, says sugar ought not to be sold for more than 11 cents
a pound. This has evidently miffed the sugar dealers, for now most
of (hem .won't sell you any sugar. Occasionally you find a dealer
jwha 'will sell,a quarter's worths-well, there ain't no such .amounts.
Let;'us jiope Mr. Palmer doesn't strike another one of those moods
and guess at a fair price on coal. 1
One respect in which Pershing Is seen to differ from Hobson
of the Menimac is iu objecting to bring kiseed indiscriminately by
women.

damage suit brought by , Mrs. Helen
Wright against J. T. Miles, sheriff
of Pima county; John Montgomery,
sheriff of MaricoDa county: George
Holloway, Pima county deputy, and
the Maryland Casualty company will
be heard in this county. Judge Stan
ford yesterday denying he motion
for change of venue in the action
based on false imprisonment.
The case 'was not set owing to
the ahsence of counsel for the Pi
ma county officers, Attorney Jones
not havine arrived from Tucson. J.
C. Wanslee and Sprowls and Down
ing, who represent the plaintiff, are
eager to have the case set for

stood that is agreeable to Judge
Kibbey, who represents Sheriff
Montgomery.
Mrs. Wright is at present in
Miami, where she joined her hus
band, who recently received his dis
charge from the army. Wright, it
is understood, was in France when
his wife was taken from the train

she was Nina Wagner, wanted here
for grand larceny. .
The arrest was made by Deputy
Hollowav. whom Mrs. Wright al
leges accompanied her to the dress
ing room on the train while she
dressed and searched her luggage

was Mrs. Wright, but insisted that
ch was the eirl who accompanied
W. D. Thornton from Oklahoma and
was later accused of stealing his
Liberty bonds.
PARENTS WED WITH THEIR
DAUGHTER AS A WITNESS
PHOENIX. Sept. 16. After a sep
aration of five years Henry Swerd
feger and Millie Swerdfeger of Flor
ence were married here today, their
16-year-old daughter, Dorothy, being
one of the witnesses, who signed
their marriage certificate.
When the couple appeared before
Cupid's deputy, W. H. Linville for
their license and gave the same
name, the clerk asked the custo
mary question, "Are you related."
to which he received the reply that
they had been divorced five years
ago.
The license was secured shortly
before noon and hardly a moment
was lost before the Swerdfegcrs
were man and wife. The service
was read by Judge Stanford during
the noon hour.

NEARLY 1.000 ATTORNEYS
ADMITTED TO ARIZONA BAR
PHOENIX. Sept. 16 The roll of
attorneys who have been at one
time or another admitted to prac
tice in Arizona as a territory or as
a state is worth the time of any
old time resident to peruse. He
will see the signautres of nearly
all the men who have been admit
ted. There are missing the names
of a lew of early practioners. none
of whom were required to sign,
though many of them did so. This
list embraces the names of 37 who
may be regarded as charter mem
bers of the bar.
It was about the middle nineties
the signatures began to be taken
and the list to date numbers 820.
Many of these men have died; com
paratively few of them have left
the state and many of them are
now engaged in other lines of busi
ness in which they have become
successful, everybody but themselves
having forgotten that they were
ever lawyers. Thus it is possible
for one to live down an evil repu
tation and redeem a misspent youth.
COCONINO COUNTY TO SPEND
$300,000 UPON ITS ROADS
FLAGSTAFF. Sept. 16. That this
county will issue bonds for $150,000
to meet a like amount of federal

Not a single voice has been raised
in opposition to the bonding, it be

foolish to pass up.
Within a few days the bonding
project will be advertised, and the

question. ' -. j . ' . ;i; .! . .

The report says that the commis
sion has investigated the public
highways of the county which in
its judgment the greatest public ne
cessity and convenience require to

hard-surface highways of varying
widths as the needs of traffic re
quire, and estimates the cost of
said improvements at $300,000; that
the roads heretofore improved by
the county and state between Flag
staff and Williams ' should be ex
tended to connec the two towns
with hard-surface highway.

Turning Back the Calendar
Sixteen Years Ago Today In Bisbee
Yesterday afternoon at about 2
o'clock Frank Francis, a miner, held
up L. C. Shattuck at the point of
a gun in front 'of the St. Louis
beer hall and demanded that Shat
tuck pay him $10 which he claimed
was due him for work performed on
the Watson group of claims, recent
ly purchased by Shattuck from
Seymour and Watson. Shattuck
shoved the barrel of the gun aside.
Francis was arrested. The cause
of the trouble is said to have re
sulted from the failure of Francis
to fulfill a contrac t " made with
Shattuck to do the assessment work
on agroup of claims near Naco
Junction. .

states that two Mexicans ' were se
verely wounded in a cutting scrape

WHAT OTHER PAPERS SAY
PROVIDING FOR POSTERITY.
Savannah News.
Has anybody a plan to offer to re
lieve the tedium and the ennui and
all that when the treaty is signed and
the strikes are all over?
COUNTRY WANTS SHOWDOWN
Philadelphia Public Ledger.
The president's plans for the Oc
tober conference of labor and capital j
should be as broad as the issue and
the country itself and there should
be no question that a real' showdown
of all the facts be made. That is.
what the public wants. But it has'
net got the facts.
STAYING IN WASHINGTON.
New York Herald.
Would it be less-majesty if a num
ber of members of the Senate pro
pose to go on a tour of the country
at the public expense to defend the
constitutional rights of their house
before the people? Anyhow, they
are staying in Washington and at
tending to business in the station to
which Providence called them.
F
are "putting up" for a better peace
for America putting up, as Mr. Wil
son violently demands.
WHAX OBJECTION?
New York Tribune.
On what grounds will the President
be able to attack the four fundament
al reservations agreed on by the
committee? He has admitted that
they are sound in principle. , He has
said that the language of the treaty
may properly be interpreted so as to
reserve to the United States all
rights reserved explicitly in the Sen
ate's ratification resolution. He ap
proved the Pittman declaratory reso
lutions, which tried to say the same
things, but in a way which would not
make it certain they would be gen
erally heard. What intelligible ob
jection can the President's frknd3
make to the four primary reservations?
ALL HONOR!
New York Sun..
All honor to the Senators, both re
publicans and democrats, who havej
resisted from the first the projected:
surrender of Ameicap , sovereignty;
and independence! All honor ' to
them for continuing to resist this
waning enterprise of stubborn indi -j

cracy until it shall have been brought
within the hounds of national com-'

CALLS FOR EXPLANATION.
New York Times.
No one has yet heard any reason
able explanation of why any Ameri
can soldiers are in Siberia or of why
more of them are not there. The
soldiers are entitled to know what is
the policy of the United States with
regard to Siberia. They aro Ameri
cans, and all that is necessary to
make, them ready to fight is to tell
them' what they are doing" it for. ' So
far the utmost they have been told
has been that they are to protect the
railroad and not take sides for or
against ihe Bolshevik!. If we are
not thvre to fight anybody, but only
to protect property, the American
people as well as the soldiers will be
deeply interested in knowing why. .WEDNESDAY, SEPTEMBER 17, 1019.-.!

BY REVIEW
" STOCKS AND BONDS
CHICAGO, Sept. 16. The same fac
tors which overshadowed yesterday's
stock market, namely uncertain labor
conditions and adverse exchange
movements were again to the fore to
day, but their influence was visibly
liminished, the session closing with a
strong undertone.
Prices rose 1 to 3 points at the out
set, but reacted that much before the
end of the first hour, when labor ad
vices became somewhat conflicting
and rates to France and Italy expe
rienced another violent collapse.
The market steadied at midday,
probably as a result of the decline in
call money, which! fell from its open
ing rate of 5 to 4 per cent, its course
thereafter being marked by the confi
dent buying of steels and e quipments.
Bethlehem Steel led the movement
at a gain of almost 5 points. Crucible,
Lackawanna and Republic steels also
moving up 1 to 3 points, while
United States steeL. which had lagged
in the early dealing, made a fractional
advance.
Aside from speculative rails, the
bond market was firm to strong, Lib
erty 3's selling slightly over par, the
foreign group including Paris 6's and
United Kingdoms, also hardening. To
tal sales par value, , were $11,250,000.
Old United States 4'& declined tf per
cent on call.others unaltered.
THE GRAIN MARKETS
CHICAGO, Sept. ' 16. New upturns
in .the value of corn took place today
largely as a result of syptoms that
distressed liquidation was over for
the present. Closing prices were
strong, 2c to 3c higher, with Septem
ber $1.404 to $1.40V and December
$1.22 to $1.23. Oats gained lc to
lc. In provisions the outcome rang
ed from 12c decline to a rise of 55c.
Notwithstanding demoralization of
foreign exchange and despite weak
ness in the hog market, corn prices
at the opening slanted toward a higher
level and with only brief interrup
tions continued , t , increase in
strength. Shorts covered freely on the
advance, and there was persistent
buying from other sources, including
cash interests and the general public.
Oats ascended with corn. Houses
with eastern connections were con
spicuous on the bull side.
In the provision market quotations
averaged higher owing mainly to the
strength of cereals and to a 2,000,000
pound decrease of the stock of lard.
THE COTTON MARKET

LAWSON ON SILVER
Thomas W. Lawson in a full page advertisement in the
eastern papers on. "Silver", among a lot of pungnt thingR, says:
"There is but one class of stock which have not advanced
to dizzy heights, which are in fact c.i the bottom, and the
merits of which are so great that they should have gone way
up in price Silver Stocks. Tn a nutshell here is the story ot
Silver: ' ''
"At a dollar aa ounce for the metal good silver mines make
large profits. Years ago, when all good silver mines were
profperous. silver metal, owins to world-wide conditious, slump
ed to less than 50 cents an ounce and the good silver mines all
Over the country busted, shut down and many of them -were
flooded. Since then good silver mines have ben a drug to
be had at bankrupt prices. The other dcy world conditions
changed and the metal flying to $1.13 on ounce and is still
booming and must continue to boom while the present in
flated prosperity endures. A good silver mine today is a
nugget of nuggets, but it takes large capital to put a silver
mine in producing shape and mining 'drains to select the good
from the fake, and mining and . financial standing end connec
tions and stock market knowledge to shape up marketwise.
!-.
