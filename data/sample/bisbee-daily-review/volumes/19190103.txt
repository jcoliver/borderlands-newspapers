WASHINGTON. Jan. 2 War condi
tions have brought about an enormous
increase in the cost of building war
ships. Rear Admiral Taylor, chief of
the bureau of construction and re
pair, told the house naval committee
today in' discussing tne 1920 naval
appropriation bill. He estimated that
the hulls and machinery of the ten
battleships and battle cruisers author
ized in 1916 would cost nearly $150.
000.000 more than estimated an in
crease of almost 50 per cent.
Admiral Taylor said he did not
think it was likely that the end of
hostilities would result in any speedy
reduction in costs. After the civil
war, he said, there was no appreciable
lowering of costs of laoor and ma
terials within three years.
Company Loses Large Sum.
"The battleship Mississippi (a new
ship delivered last year) was built
on contract for $7.115.e00." the ad
miral said, "but the company which
built it lost a large sum of money
and when bids on the battleships Cal
ifornia and Tennessee were asked
for. no contractor submitted a. bid
under the estimated cost of $7.S00.0i.
The government then decided to build

"The same increase will apply prob

and machinery alone. I would not
venture to say how much the increase
will be for the armor and armament,
but I wUl make inquiries and let the
committee know."
All Costs Increasfe.
Admiral Taylor said the cost of con
structing merchant ships has in
creased from 75 to $200 a ton. while
the cost of battleships has increased
less than 50 per cent. This has been
accomplished, he said, by exercising
the greatest economy possible in the

agents are spreading their propaganda
throughout the province, the north

supervision in private yards which
are building battleships on the ' cost
plui" basis.
"""The original estimates for the bat
tleships Colorado, Maryland, Wash
ington and West Virginia, on which
construction has been started," Ad
miral Taylor said, "waa $11,500,000.
It is doubtful if they can be completed
for less than $13,550,000."
"If there has been an increase of
$150,000,000 over the estimated cost
of the 1916 three-year program, what
will the increase be in the three-year
program just recommended by Secre
tary Daniels" asked Representative
liutler of Pennsylvania. "The cost is
estimated at $600,000,000, but the esti
mates for the individual ships are not
much larger than for those made in
the 1916 program. Surely they can
not be made cheaper than those be
ing constructed now."
Reductions Coming Soon.
Admiral Taylor replied that there
may be large reductions in the cost
of construction before the program
is started. The 1916 program will not
be completed until 1923, he said, and
the new program cannot be put into
full swing before the present one is
out of the way. Contracts for all
ships authorized in the 1916 program
have been let for 2 battleships, 12
torpedo boat destroyers. 9 submarines
and 5 auxiliary vessels, the witness
said. Of all the vessels authorized in
1916 the battlecruisers will be com
pleted last.
Secretary Daniels, who preceded
Admiral Taylor before the coromit
ttee, said electrically driven machin
ery will give future American battle
ships and battle cruisers a superiority
over the big fighting craft of ihe
other navies of the world.
Tests of the New Mexico, he de
clared, have demonstrated that such
engines can be operated more economi
cally than any others and that a ship
driven by them can run at top speed
as fong as the fuel lasts.

In almost every line of war activi

for doing work that released tbou

THE WAY TO USE VAP0RU8
FOR SPANISH INFLUENZA
The Influenza Germs, Attack the Lining of the Air Passages.
When VapoRub is Applied Over Throat and Chest, the
Medicated Vapors Inhaled, Loosen the Phlegm, Open the
Air Passages and Stimulate the Mucous Membrane to
Throw Off the Germs.
Most authorities now agree that
what we call Spanish Influenza is
simply the old-fashioned grip, which
was epidemic here in 1889-90. The in
fluenza germs enter through the nose
and mouth and attack the lining of the
air passages nose, throat and bron
chial tubes.
There is no cure or specific for this
disease, but Nature will throw off the
attack, if only you conserve your
strength. A competent physician
should always be called. The use of
VaporRub does not interfere with any
internal treatment and it is now being
used by broadminded physicians ev
erywhere, in order to stimulate the
lining of the air passages to throw off
the grip germs, to aid in loosening
the phlegn and keeping the air pas- i
sages open, thus making the breath- i
ing easier. Hot. wet towels should j
be applied over the throat, chest and
back between the shoulder blades to
open the pores. Ten VapoRub should
be rubbed in over the parts until the
skin is red. spread on thickly and
covered with two thicknesses of hot
flannel cloths. Leave the clothing
loose around the neck, as the heat of
the bdy liberates the ingredients in
the form of vapors. These vapors, in
haled with each breath, carry the
medication directly to the parts affect
ed. Aat the same time, VapoRub is
absorbed through and stimulates the
skin, attracting the blood to the sur
face, and thus aids in relieving the
congestion within.
HOW TO AVOID THE DISEASE
Evidence seoins to prove that this Is
a germ disease, spread principally by
human contact, chiefly through cough
ing, sneezing or spitting. So avoid
ing crowds common drinking cups,
roller towels, etc. Keep up your bod
ily strength by plenty of exercise in
the open air and good food.
KEEP FREE FROM COLDS.
Above all, keep free from colds, as
colds irritate the lining of the air pas
sages and render them much better
breeding places for the "germs. Use
Vicks VapoRub at the very first sign
of a cold. For a head cold, melt a lit
tle VapoRub in a spoon and inhale the
vapors, or better still, use VapoRub in
a benzoin steam kettle. If this is not
available, use an ordinary tea-kettle.
Fill half full of boiling water, put in
half a teaspoon of VapoRub from time
to time keep the kettle just slowly
boiling and inhale the steam arising.
NOTE: Vick's VapoRub is the discov
ery of a North Carolina druggist, who
found how to combine, in salve form.
Menthol and Camphor with such vola
tile oils as Eucalyptus, Thyme. Cu
bebs, etc., so that when the salve is
applied to the body heat, these ingre
dients are liberated In the form of
vapors.
VapoRub can be had in three sizes
at all druggists. While comparatively
new in certain parts of the North, it is
the standard home remedy in the
South and West for all forms of cold
troubles over six million jars were
sold last year. VapoRub is particular
ly recommended for children's croup
or colds, as it is externally applied
and can. therefore, be used freely and
often without the slightest harmful
effect.
The children of the Warren district
may now have a library of their own,
specializing in juvenile literature and
in charge of Miss Esther Friedel, a
librarian trained in meeting the lit
erary needs of children. The juvenile
library was opened at the central
school building yesterday afternoon
and last night for the first time. It
will be open nightly hereafter be
tween 6 and 8:30 o'clock.
The institution is known as the
juvenile branch of the Copper Queen
public library. At present there are
1000 volumes of juvenile literature on
the shelves. Approximately 1000 more
are to be transferred from the Copper
Queen library building to the juvenile
section soon.
The plan for the library had its in
ception several months ago. G. H.
Dowell was approached by Prof. C. F.
Philbrook and readily gave the con
sent of the company to the new
branch library. He agreed for the
company to furnish all the books,
Miss Friedel, who received her
training in the juvenile section of 5.
large public library in Brooklyn, N. Y.,
was engaged to take charge of the
new work. For several weeks she
has been at wxrk arranging and cata
loguing new books which are now in
order and ready for the children.
At the opening yesterday afternoon
approximately 300 children entered
the library. The afternoon hours are 1
from 3 to 5 o'clock.
With so auspicious an opening, it is
the belief of the school faculty that
the library will assume high impor
tance in the juvenile life of the dis
trict and through it material aid in
educating the children can be gained.

More Good Roads
Good roads movements have start
ed in earnest with the new year. In
every state of the union highways are
" receiving renewed attention. At the
behest of President Wilson, highway
enthusiasts, associations and organi
zations are mapping out plans for new
projects, for the improvement of old
roads and for the rebuilding of those
arteries which have been worn into
rutted byways under strain of war
traffic.
Arizona is responding to the presi
dent's call. Arrangements for a state
wide meeting of highway men, under
the auspices of the Good Roads as
.sociation are under way. It is pos
sible that as a result of the meeting,
which is to be held in Phoenix this
month, plans for extensive road re
pairing in Arizona will be placed be
fore the people.
The Warren district will assist in
this movement within the state, and
Cochise county, the best good roads
section of the etate, will support ev-
erv constructive recommendation of
the meeting. Plans to go even fur-
their in the up-building of main-line
arteries are being considered in tiie
county, and it is now assured that
well known representatives from Co
chise will attend the national meet
ings of the United States Good Roads
association, at Mineral Wells, Tex
next April.
That this county should turn 'its
attention to good roads is but natural.
Closer relations of communities re
sults when better links of highway
join them. Business conditions im
prove. Convenience of travel is en
hanced. Pleasures of the ut-door
world grow greater.
But, there is a deeper, more sig
nificant reason than those of in
dividual interest or community bene
fit. President Wilson has appealed
to every state and county to increase
as far as possible highway improve
ment Other governmental agencies
have joined the president in his re
quest. The nation needs, for eco
nomic, social and business reasons,
the added stimulus of a great na
tional and many state and county
road building programs.
All students of economics are
agreed that this nation faces a pe
riod oi stress during the next six
months. Most concur in the belief
that so-called hard times will accom
pany this period of stress. Certain
it is that in the copper mining indus
try the period of stress is already
appearing, and that relief of some
character must come soon. Thou
sands upon thousands of soldiers are
returning to their homes. War time
enterprises are belching forth thou
sands of employes, jobless, now that
war ao longer demands the materials
they manufactured. Someplace, the
nation must absorb these workers."
Good roads is one of the logical so
lutions. More good roads mean more
work, less idle men. Naturally bene
ficial to business, society and pleas
ure, good roadi at this moment in the
nation's history, assume a place of
importance never in the past attached
to them.
Good highways have always been
necessary. Today they are imperative.
Level-Headed Hun
Apparently, in all of Germany, there
is one level-headed, foresighted, con
structive Hun.
Maximilian Harden, editor of Die
Zukunft, of Berlin, has appealed to
his countrymen to "make a demon
stration of good faith and readiness to
secure confidence by giving guaran
tees."
Harden has been the thorn in the
kaiser's side on more than one occa
sion in the past four years. His criti
cisms of German conduct of the war
have been bitter; his ringing editor
ials have more than once caused the
tightening of the imperious hand of
the crown on his paper.
Again and again he has looked in;o
the future and spoken, in spite of
royal warnings and threats. This
time be strikes nearer the truth than
ever in the past.
Germany, be says, has accepted the
official lie, that the nation was wan
tonly attacked, in order to conceal the
responsibility of the emperor for even
tual defeat, and when defeat came, he
adds, the rulers were let off too light
ly. The German people, he asserts,
do not understand the account which
is being made up against them nor
realize the situation they have to face.
He admits "fifty-one months of bru
tal rule in Belgium, during which ev
ery law of humanity was broken; the
devastation of northern France; air
raids against all law; the custom of
sinking hospital ships; secret agree-j
ment with the Irish and Flemish; the
smuggling of explosives, bacilli and
incenoiary Instruments into neutral
eountries; and everywhere bribery.
fraud end theft."
But what demonstration of good
faith can Germany make to secure
confidence? 'And, if she should make
demonstrations of good faith and guar
antees to secure them, what faith
could the allies place in them?
Herr Hardin admits that "ibe allied
view is that the German revolution
is a fraud.
German perfidy, which places the
brand of deceit on the revolution, will
indelibly mark German demonstra
tions of good faith and guarantees un
til a new Germany is reared from the
ruins of Hohenzollernlsra.

next Monday, the board of supervisors
apd other officials yesterday organ

new government. They acted in or
ganization on the opinion of County
Attorney Robert N. French, who ruled
that the state law permits assumption
of offices at the opening of the year.
Except for an occasional difference
of opinion the initial meeting of the
board of supervisors was carried off
without marring incident, with I. C. E.

sumed the reins with ease and con
ducted the meeting in businesslike
manner indicative of ability.
About 10 o'clock the members of
the board gathered about the table.
Supervisor Charles Roberts moved
that I. C. E. Adams be selected as
chairman, the motion was seconded by
Mr. Sparks and was then put by him
and carried. Mr. Adams in a few
words thanked the other members of
the board for the honor they had con
ferred on him and stated that it was
his desire to see that all taxpayers in
the county be given a square deal and
that he hoped with the assistance of
the other members to give the people
of the county a good, economical ad
ministration and that the interests of
all would be looked after.
The appointment of a clerk was tak
en up. Mr. Roberts nominated Louie
Kuckenbecker, the nomination was
seconded by Mr. Sparks and was made
unanimous by Chairman Adams. The
matter of an assistant clerk was post
poned. Miss Belle Gaudy was given

office.

DEFENDS PRESIDENT
WASHINGTON, Jan. 2 Republican
critics of President Wilson and his
peace terms were attcked in the sen
ate today by Senator Lewis of Illinois,
the democratic whip. Replying to re
cent addresses of Senators Lodge of
Massachusetts, and Knox of Pennsyl
vania, Senutor Lewis charged that
"certain leaders of the republican
side" had conspired for politicil pur
poses to discredit the president in the
eyes of European negotiators and to
defeat his plans.
The Illinois senator was unable to
conclude bis speech today, but will
finish tomorrow after hich Senator
Borah of Idaho, republican, an oppon
ent of a league of nations, plans to
reply. Senators Thomas of Colorado,
democrat, and Cummins of Iowa, re
publican, also expect to discuss peace
and related questions tomorrow.

exact temperature yesterday aud j
guesses ranged from freezing point
down almost to zero. However, the

shone all day.
Considerable suffering is said to
have been found among the poor
people of the district and the Warren
District Relief association and Other
organizations, as well as individuals,
h.ive been busy doins; all in their
power to alleviate it. Shoes, clothing
and fuel are said to have been found
wanting, particularly among the Mexicans.

Back From France
To Work in Mines
Cpl. John Floyd, son of J. E. Floyd
of Douglas, formerly a resident of
Bisbee and an employe of the South
west mine, has arrived here from
France, following his discharge from
the 475111 aero squad. Mr. Floyd was
in France for a year, being stationed
throughout that period near Paris,
where he was a cadet student aviator.
On his sleeve he wears a red chevron,
signifying his discharge from the
service, while on the other sleeve are
two gold strires, indicating one year
of foreign service.
Floyd went from Bisbee to Kelly i
field, where he spent three months i
acquiring the rudiments of av iation, j
He then was transferred to Newport j
News, Va., from which port he sailed i
for France. At the time he joined the
army he weighed 1-0 pounds, but as
an evidence of the wholesome effect
of the service upon him he said he
now tips the scales at 160 pounjs. ;
There are three boys in the Floyd
family. The two brothers of Corporal i
Floyd stiil are in France with the!
army.

About the State
Mesa: Arriving at his office this
afternoon for the first time since an
attack of influenza, W. R. Stewart
within an hour was taken home with
a broken arm, sustained when he at
tempted to crank his auto.
Yuma: Sgt. Robert W. Bailey of
Camp Lewis, arrived in Yuma last
night and will be the new "motor
cycle cop" of the sheriffs office on
the Warrentine road between Yuma
and Somerton and elsewhere in the
county. The demand for such an of
ficer has increased lately on account
of the many accidents on this road.
Nogales: Following several months
of wandering around Sonora, a large
part of the time without funds, and
sometimes hungry, H. A. Lewis, a for
mer employe of the Wells Fargo Ex
press company here, surrendered to
the local police at the Morley avenue
crossing of the International line
Lewis has been in Mexico for sot
eral months, and for the past few
weeks has been in Nogales, where it
la alleged, he had no visible means
of support.
Yuma: Ferdinand Sbultz, charged
with manslaughter, as the result of
an automobile collision on the War-
renite road, in which the car Shultz
was driving struck one of the Sangui
netti trucks. Is before the superior
court, represented by his attorney. W
r Timmons. The case had been held
up for over a week on account of
the demand of the defendant's counsel
for the evidence in the preliminary
trial wnich was held in the justice
court.
Nogales: Advices from San Fran
cisco are to the effect that in that city
one clay last week, there died from
influenza. Frank P. Demaro of Guay
mas. Mr. Demaro was assistant to

ness circles on the West coast of Mex
ico. He was in San Francisco eneaeed

connection with the Mexico corpora
tion. Mr. Deniaro's wife and baby are
visiting in Cincinnati. Ohio. Deceased

and he will be missed by a large cir
cle of friends and acquaintances.
Prescott: Attorney Robert E. Mor
rison of Prescott, has filed suit for
$57,500 against E. J. DeSabia, jr., the
Intercontinental company and the AI-
b Securities company, the action
having been filed for the dual purpose
of attempting to reimburse the plain-
uii ior professional services which
the latter alleges he rendered, and to
compensate Joseph E. Morrison, broth
er of the plaintiff, for losses which
the complaint alleges he sustained by
reasons of misrepresentations made to
him by De Sabla regarding the market
value of the stock of the Navajo Cop
per company. The complaint states
that the defendants are indebted to
Mr. Morrison for legal services, and
damages in the sum of $500 are asked
to take care of this matter. The Judg
ment of $57,060 is asked in behalf of
E. Morrison, the latter having assign
ed his claim against the defendants to
his brother, the plaintiff.
Phoenix: An order was issued by
the state corporation commission to
day authorizing the Humboldt Im
provement company to make improve
ments and to transfer 2500 shares of
stock of the company to the Consoli
dated Arizona Smelter company to
cover a loan of $200,000 and for loans
as needed to promote the develop
ment and operation of the business.
The order was made on a certificate
of convenience and necessity and to
sell and transfer stock. The certifi
cate sets forth that the company is
capitalized for $300,200 of 3000 shares
with a par value of $100 each. The
order specifically states the Humboldt
Improvement company may construct
and operate an electric light plant and
water plant for the purpose of serv
ing the people of Humboldt and vicin
ity. The transfer to the smelter com
pany of stock is to cover the loan re
quired to make these improvements,
the order states.

the trio of Mexicans w ho had been in
the county jail at Florence since the
latter part of September on charges of
being implicated in the killing of Hor
ace Harrison, a mine watchman at Je
rome during the Mexican riot at that
time, were yesterday taken to Jerome
aud arraigned before Justice of the
Peace Frank E. Smith for their pre
liminary examination. Because of the
fact that the Jerome district had un
til recently been in a state of quaran
tine because of the influenza, the hear
ings had to be postponed, and did not
take place until yesterday. The de
fendants all entered pleas of not
guilty, but the court felt that there
was a sufficient amount of evidence
against them to warrant their being
held to the superior court, and they
were accordingly placed under bonds
of $5000 each. None of them was able
to raise this amount of money and all
were returned to the county jail to
await the jury session of Judge Swee
ney's court.

BY REVIEW
j NEW YORK, Jan. 2 The criSis in
I the local traction situation, as indi
cated by the projection of the Brook
lyn Rapid Transit company into fed
eral receiversnip, served in a measure
to impair confidence on the stock ex
change today.
Instead of the new year buying,
which was expected as a logical se
quel to the recent heavy selling for
adjustment of 1918 income tax ac
counts, traders extended their short
commitments, but covered urgently in
the later dealings when a spectacular
raise in oils gave activity to the gen
eral list and effaced many losses.
The advance in oils was featured
by Mexican Petroleum, which made
a net gain slightly in excess of 10
points after showing an early loss of
almost 4, while Texas company re
versed its setback of the morning
with a gain of 3 points.
Rails, coppers and numerous spe
cialties were lifted by the sudden
change of the last hour, Texas Pa
cific denoting confident accumulation
at an advance of 3 points. American
Smelting made more than full recov
ery and many other leaders closed at
moderate net gains, including United
States Steel.
Brooklyn Transit fell 6 at its
worst to 20, within 2 points of
the lowest record in the road's history
of 20 years ago; the 7 per cent notes,
which precipitated the bankruptcy
broke 5V4 points and other local util
ities 1 to 3 points, rallying slightly
later.
Motors, shippings, equipments and
distilling issues responded variably to
the general improvement, the market
liuishing with a strong undertone.
Sales amounted to 535,000 shares.
Bonds, as a whole, were unsettled
by the break in tractions, but Liberty
issues were steady and Internationals,
notably Anglo-French 5s. stiffened.
Total sales, par value, aggregated $10,-4
50,000. Old United States bonds
were unchanged on call.
COTTON MARKET.
NEW YORK, Jan. 2. Cotton
closed at a net decline of 18 to 6
points,, with the late months relatively
easy.
GRAIN MARKET.
CHICAGO. Jan. 2. Aggressive sell
ing of corn resulted today from the
prevailing cold wave, which seemed
likely to stimulate the movement of
the crop. Prices closed unsettled,
to 14 net lower, with January $1.42
and May $1.35 to $1.35. Oats fin
ished off to 1: advance, and provi
sions varying from 50c decline to 12c
advance.
vwm temperatures below zero in
many sections, sentiment was bearish
throughout the session. Traders were
nearly unanimous in looking for en
larged receipts as a consequence of
the improved conditions for shelling
and hauling.
Improved shipping demand from
the east and south lifted January
oats, other deliveries sagged with
corn. i
Denial that the attorney general's
announcement as to price fixing
would at feet the government mini
mum for hogs led to considerable buy
ing 01 provisions, but the offerings
soon necaine overpientlful.
METAL MARKET.
NEW YORK, Jan. 2. Copper Nom
inal; electrolytic, 20 to 23c.
Lead Easy; spot, $6 asked.
Spelter Lasy; spot. East St. Louis
delivery, offered at $8.70.

mand from the court, H being his first

BOUNCING BABY BOY.

tor for the Bisbee store of the Phelps
Dodge Mercantile company.
FROM CANANEA.
Dr. I. B. Hamilton and family came
up yesterday from Cananea and will
spend a few days here on a visit. Dr.
Hamilton is one of the pioneer physi
cians of the county and was located in
Tombstone during its early history.
FROM RANCH.
William Lutley was in the city yes
terday from his ranch in Leslie can
yon on his way to Tombstone. He has
made arrangements with W. A. Fowler
of Tombstone for the pasturing of
several hundred head of cattle on the
latter's pasture near the Cowan rancn,
11 miles cast of Tombstone. Several
hundred head in California on pastur
age he recently disposed of.
WAS HELD UP.
Charles Edmonson, Cananea com
mission merchant, was in the city yes
terday on a short business trip. He is
telling a tale of hard luck. He stated
that on January 1 the Mexican govern
ment placed a duty on sugar and flour
of $1.10 a hundred pounds. He had
a car of each at Naco on Tuesday
night but was unable to get them
across in time' to save the increased
duty.
telow the handsome residence of Wal-
Douglas, will be graded, planted
with grass .and trees this spring, ac
cording to aiisouncement made yes
terday by J. C. Cowan of the Warren
i company.
With the contemplated improve
ment of the park, it will become the
I largest public pleasure ground in the
j state of Arizona, Mr. Cowan said,
j lying in a strip five blocks long and
a bloc k wide.
In tood weather the park is well
I patronized, particularly the section
containing the bandstand and. broad.
; cement sidewalks.
Xot alone is this a pleasure center
when open air dances are being given,
; but for children on roller skates and
those with velocipedes, tricycles, toy
automobiles and the like, the side
walks are a playground.
Xot only do the people of Warren
take advantage of the generous plan
cn which the townsite was laid out,
but almost any sunshiny day people
from us far away as Tombstone canyon
take the street car ride and enjoy the
pleasant surroundings of. the park.
Mr. Cowan did not state what plans
will be followed in making the im
provement, out said that unless a
decided change is made in present
plans, improvement work would be
started early in the spring.
Camas claims that iu an altercation
in which he became engaged with
Vlasas, the latter drew a knifo and
would have used it on him had not
other men interfered and separated
them.
This was the maiden case of the
new justice of the peace and even
though there was a large audience
present he showed no signs of "stage
fright." It also was the first arrest
by the new coustable, A. E. Sheppard.

Shepperd, F. E. Thomas and Motor
Deputy Jack Ryan were in Tombstone
yesterday to attend the meeting of the
board of supervisors. All of them had

LANDSCAPE ARTIST HERE.
Grace Church Jones, the landscape
and figure artist, has arrived in the
district in the course of a tour of Ari
zona and will remain here for several
days, at least. She is making her
headquarters in Warren and from
there making daily excursions In or
der to paint the hills and other fea
tures of the landscape. Miss Jones
finds the rugged landscape of that
section with its changing lights and
shadows, and its peculiar coloring, an
entrancing subject.
BACK TO DUTY.
TO NEW HEADQUARTERS.
Justin C. Daspit. who has been in
charge of the office of the depart
ment of justice at Douglas since July,
1917, has received notice of his an-
pointment as head of the newly
created southern Arizona district of
the southwestern division. His office
W. li. Taylor, son of Mr. and Mrs. wl be at Tucson and he will have
H. R. Taylor of Wood canyon, left on tne Douglas, Bisbee, Tucson and Xo
the Golden State limited yesterday ! sales offices under his supervision,
morning for Xew York to resume his XIr- Daspit, who was in the city yes
post of duty on the Iowa. He was one ' terday, expects to leave for Tucsoii
of the boys from Bisbee who enlisted ias B00n as nis successor at Douglas ar-
earlv in the war and will coinulete his . rives
four year enlistment.
The Liar," at the Eagle theater to
day, is a play that strikes right down
to the depths of every mother's heart
or, for that matter the heart of any
body who reveres and respects moth
erhood. And in enacting the big,
smashing problem that la given in
this production, Miss Pearson rises
to great heights of dramatic power.
She is supported by a cast notable
for its consistent ability.
In "The Lair," Miss Pearson por
trays the role of a girl who is sought
in marriage by the scheming superin
tendent of her father's Haitian plan
tation. When the girl repulses the
man and is about to wed another, this
superintendent confronts her with the
accusation tnat she has a negro strain
in her blood.
She laughs at him, but months later.
w nen she is about to become a mother,
he confronts her husband .with papers
which purport to be proof of his assertion.
Dr. La Rose, famous psychic, who
has frequently visited the district in
the past four or five years, arrived
in Bisbee yesterday and opened
offices in the Letson hotel. He will
remain here several days.
Dr. La Rose brings with him many
letters from high authorities giving
word as to his powers and ability' in
his falling. Among these letters is
one from the commissioner of public
safety of Colorado Springs, the presi
dent and business manager of the
Albuquerque Journal, and several
other well known persons.
Dr. La Rose always meets hundreds
of residents of this district on his
visits here. He extends a most cordial
invitation to the public to investigate
his standing and invites any one need
ing his services to call at his offices
ana receive tne benefit or nis care
ful study of the psychic phenomena.
The mo: t nni jue resid-nce in the
district, both because of its construc
tion and the fact that it probably will
take the lowest fire itisurance rate
in the entire Warren district, is the
newly completed home of Lee Dean,
u well-known I aluinet & Arizoua
; miner, on Xuvajo Trail in Warren.
; Woi.il and inflammable materials of
' all character are almost entirely ab
i sent from its construction, the entire
; residence, including the luof, bting of
i poured concrete.
Mr. Dean did all of the work on
the house himself, building on the
mission style and after the fashion he
had learned while an employe of the
Southern Pacific de Mexico railroad
at Empalme, Sonora.
The new residence is attractive ia
appearance and handsomely fitted on
the Interior. One of its attractions to
the home builder is that it will grow
better with age, instead of worse as
in the case of dwellings of other ma
terials, while nothing less than the
rude shock of a blast could destroy
it. If he desired to do so, Mr. Dean
could build a bonfire on the roof
without doing material damage to the
structure.
It is predicted in Warren that as a
result of Mr. Dean's pioneer effort in
this field, other concrete houses
probably will be built in the near
future. The material will allow nu
merous variations to there will be do
more danger cf a "sameness" in
architecture than if brick or stone
were used.
