Rumors were circulated here today
that several Villa leaders were killed.
It was established however, that the
reported execution of Martin Lopez
was a pure fabrication. There is a re
port tonight that Idefjso Sanchez has
been killed, but this is not credited.

VILLA WANTS FOOD.
EL PASO, Tex., Mov. 15. At the
Mexican consulate general here today
it was said that Villa's purpose in tak
ing Ojinaga was to replenish his food
supply and to dispose 'of one million
pesos in silver bullion which his men
had gathered in loot during the past
few months. Consulate General Se
guin, while professing to be without of
ficial advice son the subject, said that
General Francisco Murguia would un
doubtedly dispatch a strong force from
Chihuahua City to attacq the rebels
from the rear and thus make Ojinaga
umenable for the Villa followers.
Mexicans Rejoic
Among Mexican1 refugees, men who
are generally hostile to the Carranza
government but who were never Iden
tified with Villa, there was open re
joicing over the fall'jf Ojinaga. A rep
resentative of one of the largest min
ing companies operating in Western
Chihuahua is authority for the state
ment that the Villa attack on Ojinaga
is the first open movement in a gener
al plan for the overthrow of Carranza.
This man claims t'j have information
that Villa has but recently returned
from southern Mexico where he con
ferred with Emilio Zapata. Felix Diaz
and other leaders of anti-government
factions, and tua; an understanding
has been leached whereby all will co
operate in the new revolution. It Is
further claimed that while Felix Diaz
is the ostensible head of the new
movement, the real leader is remaining
in the background and is known only
to a few persons. Preparations for
the revolt, it is asserted, have been
underway for many monJis but hostil
ities have been delayed because of
fear of interference by the United
States.. This ear. it is said, is no
longer felt because of the belief that
the Cnited States Is so fully occupied
in th4 war with Germans as. to have
"A'iiiue to bother wi:h Mexican affairs
unless American interests are vitally
affected. This it is planned to av'oid
by giving every protection to foreign
srs and their property.
" According to the plans as revealed
here. Villa is to be commander of the
army of Northern Mexico and in re
turn for this position has promised
loyal and unquestioned 'obedience to
the real head of the revolution.
Villa sympathizers here say that Vil
la's next move will be the taking of
Juarez, to be followed quickly by the
capture of Chihuahua City and that
these three cities will be used as bases

"When my wife first started on Tan

pounds and when she finished her third

of 201 Furnish Avenue, San Antonio
and while remarkable, it is only one of
many hundreds of wonderful endorse
ments that have been published in con

"for six years," he continued, "my
wife was in a general run-down condi
tion and had no appetite. She
couldn't eat meats and many other
things and the gas on her stomach
made her heart flutter and it seemed
like at times she would almost smoth
er to death. She was constipated all
the time, had awful headaches and
backache. She lost weight and got so
weak and nervous she could hardly
sleep.
"I bought Tanlac for her because I
read st much about it and I'll tell any
body it's good medicine, and I don't .be
lieve there's anything can come up to
it. When my wife finished her third
bottle she could eat anything without
it hurting her .and sleep every nifciit
like a log. Her headaches, nervous
ness and backache were all gone and
she had actually gained eighteen
pounds. I have two little girls, eleven
and fourteen years old, who took Tan
lac, too and they just want to eat up
everything I can't begin to tell how
much Tanlac has been worth to my
family and I believe there are lots of
other people here who could get re

fair trial."

THREE
f
GOVERNMENT LOANS
FOR RAILROADS IS
SERIOUSLY TALKED
(By Review Leased Wire.)
WASHINGTON. Nov. 15. The ques
tion of the government loaning money
to the railroads was brought forward
today at the advanced rate hearing be
fore the Interstate commerce commis
sion. Samuel Rea, president of the Penn
sylvania railroad said he believed the
time had arrived when government
loans should beser!ousIy considered
and Clifford Thome, counsel for the
shippers stated he believed It the prop
er solution for the railroad situation.
Mr. Rea testified however, that should
the money be forthcoming from the
Rovernment It ought not to Influence
the proposed freight increase while
shippers counsel believed the plan
should be made effective in lieu of the
rate Increase.
Rea's statement regarding the loan
came after he had testified that the
Pennsylvania could not get more
freight cars until the middle of next
year that he did not believe It possible
to increase the output of locomotives
largelv because of what he referred to
as a disadvantageous labor situation,
and that he did nbt believe it would be
right to attempt bond flotation while
be government was attempting to
mpVe larger war loans.
The hearing today was confined to
eastern railroads. Besides Mr. Rea,
Howard Elliott of the New Haven and
G. M. Shriber, vice president of the
Baltimore and Ohio, were examined
and John Muir of the Railway Inves
tors' league made a plea in favjr of in
creased rates.. '
Mr. Thome Indicated in a statement
given out tonfeht that shippers counsel
will maintain . that the government
should loan money for needed improve
ments and new equipment rather than
to allow the railroads to forward new
construction and build equipment with
earnings.
APPREHENSION IS
FELT OVER TAMPICO
OIL FIELD STATUS
(By Review Leased Wire.)
WASHINGTON, Nov. 15. Interna
tional apprehension has been arou.sea
by ihe apparent determination of Pres
ident Carranza or Mexico to drive the
long unmolested Manuel Palaez and
his little rebel army from the oil fields
near Tampico. There was evident to
day in allied legations and embassies
a feeling that German influence had
played a part in starting this move
which may prove embarrassing to the
kaiser's enemies.
General Manuel Dieguez has been
pen; into the field with a considerable
force with orders u clear the country
between San Luis Potosi and Tampico
of rebels. Official reports reaching
Washington indicate, the effectiveness
cf this work. Already he has defeated
one body of rebel troops and killed
Magdalena Cedillo, one of the two Ce
dillo blathers who long have been the
leaders of the revolutionists in that
part of Mexico. It is expected General
Dieguez will move towards the coast
and attack Palaez.
Representatives of foreign govern
ment display more concern over the
news of the campaign against Palaez,
than they have over any other recent
development In Mexican affairs. The
Tampico situation is of vital concern
because of the huge volume of oil ship
ped from that port to the allies.
The fear now frankly is expressed
that Carranza's action may result In
an attempt by the rebels to destroy oil
properties.

Local Board Must
j Give Much Data
Following the new draft regulations
I made by the provost marshal, with the
i approval of President Wjjson, the Co
i chise' county local draft board yester
I decided my small can of Cotto
lene should make a Thanksgiving
feast of "delicious economy."
Until I tried I would not have
believed anyone could enjoy making
. a short purse go so long a way.
I thought I knew something about
Cottolene before I made this partic
ular experiment. But now I can tell
you almost anything you want to
know about Cottolene: How rich it
is. How much farther it goes. What
famous results it brings in your
"fine" as well as your "every-day"
baking and frying.
The recipes which I chose were
inviting and inexpensive.
Then 1 used one-third less of
Cottolene than I would have used of
butter or other shortening called for
in the recipes. And I was so proud
of the results, including the econ
omy, that I had my Thanksgiving
feast photographed.
That's their "picture" at the top.
Of course the"proof of thepudding
is in the eating not in the photog
raphy. And if these cakes, cookies,
pudding, pies and tarts, croquettes

'Makes Good Cooking Better
day received a letter from Provost
Marshal General Crowder enclosing
blanks and giving instructions as to
what Is necessary relative to data for
use in the next draft. The marshal
instructs the local board to solicit the
aid of teac-hers. college professors, law
yers and every other person available
to aid in securing necessary data
which is needed for the new classifica
tion. A list of questions covering the
status of drafted boys already at the
cantonments is enclosed, and further
lists giving information as to how to '
proceed with the coming draft Th
occupation of every man who has been
drawn Is one of the things the govern
ment wants to know. Others are
wheiher married or single, whether he
has dependents, etc., etc.
Secretary Krebs said yesterday that
It was going to be some job to obtain
the information desired.
The department fixes a time limit on'
securing the data. In counties of 1.
000 population the board will be given
three days; in counties of from 1,000 to
3,000. six days: 3.000 to 5.000, ten days,
and over 5,000 two weeks.
It is the purpose of the government
to have all the necessary data at hand
and properly compiled at Washington
bo the next draft can be made not later ,
than Febrauary 15. 1918. The next'
draft is going to take every man bo far j

and biscuits could speak, I am sure
they would all say "Use Cottolene."
For each cne has its individual -story
of richness and wholecomeness; of
crispy, flaky flavorinecs; of " cooking
more appetizing and digestible than
ever before. All linked together in
delightful economy.
For all were made without ex
pensive butter with one small can
of rich, economical Cottolene.
And, now, you too can prove this
"delicious economy" in your baking.
You can easily discover for yourself:
(1) That Cottolene makes cakes
which butter might well bo proud cf.
(2) That Cottolene takes the place
of butter and all other she-rteuings
in baking and frying.
(3) That foods "deep-fried" in
Cottolene are wholesome and digestible.
And I think ypu will find as I have
that nothing can take the place of
Cottolene economy in your kitchen.
On th:j page I am giving the
recipe I used for my Thanksgiving
pudding. Try it and see how deli
cious, economical cooking can be.

fourths as much of this

ALASKA DOING ITS BIT
A steamer from Anchorage, Alaska, docked at "a
Pacific port" a few dajs ago, and among its items of
cargo were fifty tons of Irish potatoes grown in the
Matanuska valley!
The spuds are only a small part of the foodstuffs
Uncle Sam has received thus far this season from "Se
ward's Ice box" or "Seward's polar bear garden," as
Alaska was otherwise characterized on the floor of the
senate when negotiations for its purchase by the United
States were under way. And it all goes to help Uncle
Sam provision himself and his war associates, and to aid
them in drubbing the Prussian kaiser.
Alaska has helped wonderfully in addition to supply
ing foods, such as fish, fats, meat and vegetables, by the
vast quantities of metals and mineral products which
abound there in quantity sufficient almost for the world's
needs. fcor have Alaskans been at all backward about
contributing their full quota of hard, cold cash.
This is emphasized by Mrs. John C. Dougherty, of
Anchorage, who came to "the states" on the same boat
that brought the potatoes, and who, in a newspaper in
tervie wsoon after landing, said:
"We may be quite a distance from the war,
but we are standing behind every move. Our
Red Cross societies are busy and we oversub
scribed our share of the second Liberty loan.
"I came down with fifty tons of potatoes from
. the Matanuska valley, the Wenatchee valley of
the north. That was just one of he many ship
ments of vegetables that have been cent from
Alaska this year in order that not only Ameri
cans but the other peoples of the world might
have food."
It is the same everywhere in the states, in Hawaiian
territory, the Philippines everybody is doing his utmost
to help his country and help make the world safe for
democracy, and Alaska 13 well toward the front.
. In that same interview Mrs. Dougherty declared that
commodities generally, ard she specified ladies' shoes,
are as cheap in price in the far north whence she came
as she finds them in the states. Why that should be
so, she, of course, does not attempt to explain, nor can
we. Anyhow, to discuss it would be changing the sub
ject and a digression from a happy and a very refreshing
theme to one not so much so.
WHAT RUSSIA MUST LEAVE
The Bolshevik! now in control at Petrograd are in
sistent upon making peace with the German autocracy
on the basis of "no annexations and no indemnities,"
but no such terms are -offered for domestic peace. At
home the Lenines and Trotzkys are demanding both an
nexations and indemnities. Land that is privately owned
is to be seized and the hated bourgeoiets is to be de
spoiled. Germany is a privileged enemy. All the ruth
lessness of the Bolshevik! is directed against other
Russians.
The pendulum has swung from the tyranny of the
czar and the nobility to the tyranny of the peasant and
the anarchist, and tyranny is tyranny under whatever
form it masquerades. The plans of the Bolshevik! lead
ers are often described as Utopian. There Is nothing
Utopian about them. They represent an attempt to apply
to domestic affairs the principles that govern the foreign
policy of Germany; namely, that might makes right and
whoever has the power shall take what he pleases.
Secretary Baker, expressing his confidence in the
Ultimate ability of the Russian people to establish law
and order, says that "if there is any lesson to be gained
from history it is that a great people like the Russians
find that liberty and order go hand In hand." They
have not found it yet. They will never find It under the
leadership of the pro-German anarchists who are now In
control, but they are likely to find it out of their own
inevitable disasters and suffering.
They are facing a winter of calamity due to their own
folly and Ignorance. It is likely that hundreds of thou
sands of them will perish from cold and starvation, be
cause they have rejected the ordinary precautious that
men must take for self-preservation. The situation will
get worse before it gets better, but by spring even the
most reckless of the agitators will have gained a little
clearer notion of the immutable truth that man must
earn his bread in the sweat of his face. He cannot sup
port himself by despoiling his neighbor, nor can any
government be erected upon the principle of dividing
property without work.
The Russians are in for a painful and bitter lesson, but
it will be worth to them all it costs. No country can
turn its back upon the accumulated experience of human
history. When the Russians have learned that they will
be ready for self-government and tor all the benefits of
liberty. The Bolsheviki rule is certain to collapse,' be
cause it contains in itself all the seeds of its own
destruction.
As for the United States, its interest in Russia will
not be impaired by the lunatic performance in Petrograd.
The American people are not concerned with Russia
merely as a military ally whose help was desired in
crushing Prussianlsm. Russia after the war ia more im
portant to them than Russia during the war. Without
a self-governing Russia that is sane and sound and ruled
according to law and liberty there can be no durable
peace in the world. The United States stands always
ready to aid that kind of a Russia. Many of us hoped
that it might come without the excesses and the anarchy
that have now paralyzed the Russian people, but the
Important thing is that a free Russia should finally
emerge from this welter and be able to take its place
among the great democratic nations.
THE PRESS AND THE TREASURY
Since the United States entered the war thousands of
patriotic Americans have volunteered their services to
the government. Some volunteered their services in the
army, some in the navy, and some in various civil em
ployments. In addition, many in the two Liberty loan
campaigns and in other great national measures have
devoted and are devoting all or part of their time at a
nominal compensation or entirely without compensation,
to the service of their country.
If ever a list is madeN of these American citizens
who have volunteered their services to their country at
war it will be found that no calling, profession, or busi
ness can show a higher percentage (if any can be shown
so high) as that of the press of the nation. The large
city dailies, with their tremendous circulations, and the
small local weeklies that penetrate into the humblest
homes of the dwellers in villages and on farms alike have
devoted their talents, energies, and space to their govern
ment
The loyal foreign-language papers have been as gen
erously patriotic as th others and have preached Ameri
canism and duty in thirty-six different languages.
In the second Liberty loan campaign, as in the first.
the newspapers of the country have shown their unselfish
patriotism, and the splendid results in each campaign
are in a great measure evidence of their power and
influence.
Many millions of American newspaper readers are
now bondholders of their government, a great number
made so through the influence of the newspapers they
read. They are interested as never before, and in more
direct, personal way, in governmental matters, and espe
cially in the finances of their government.
In addition there are to be other issues of govern
ment bonds. These bond issues are not going to be sold
entirely through patriotism and enthusiasm. Emotion
alone will not suffice to induce the American people to
absorb these tremendous bond issues. The judgment of
the nation must be appealed to and the people must be
thoroughly educated and informed as to United State3
bonds and government finance.
KNITTING FOR THE SOLDIERS
The , State Council of Defense has received word
from Washington that no attention should be paid to
rumors to the effect that knitted goods are not ac
ceptable and that army men are not permitted to receive
them. There is only one caution issued to the patriotic
women who are producing this warm apparel: Don't
use gaudy yarns. All such articles should be knitted
In neutral colors, otherwise the soldiers will not be al
lowed to use them. The reason for this ruling is plain.
Bright colors render soldiers conspicuous and expose
them unnecessarily to the enemy's fire. It is -much
preferred by the War Department, that knitted goods be
given to the Red Cross for distribution as that organiza
tion knows exactly where there Is most need of them.
The Department, however, does not deny anyone the
right to donate such goods to Individuals or to regimental
units. .

WOMAN'S WORK.
During the war women will do more and more of the
work man once thought be alone could and should do.
And it is fortunate.
But from some lines of human endeavor we wish to
exclude women and girls. Among them is shining men's
shoes.
The other day a Boston man opened a "girl bootblack
parlor." He employed young and good looking girls to
take the places of negro and Greek men and boys.
The mayor of Boston ordered the place closed and
threatened to revoke the license of any shoe shining es
tablishment where girls or women were employed.
"I cannot imagine."' lie said, "any occupation more j
humiliating to women than cleaning men's shoes. ' The
man who would allow a woman to shine his shoes Is, in
my opinion, utterly unworthy of being called a man."
Woman cannot help man by shining his shoes, and
no decent man would ask her to. Let the men shine
their own shoes; the exercise will be good for them.

Eisbea finished its drive for $5000,

Three days were given to the cam

raised.
Boys' Campaign
The boys' war work campaign still
continues. Pledges are still coming
into headquarters. The campaign will
be completed by Saturday night. The
boys have gone clear "over the top"
and have subscribed 60 per cent above
their quota. Their quota is $400, and
up to 5 p. tn. yesterday $641 bad been
received in pledges. The boys in War
ren are yet to be seen and the amount
will probably reach $700 when all re
turns are in. Any boy who wishes to
pay his subscription at once may pay
Harry,Harshman, chairman of the col
lection committee, or he may pay at
the office of the boys' department of
the Y. M. C. A. Fifty per cent of all
subscriptions are due December 15, 25

, LONDON, Nov. 13. (Correspond
ence of The Associated Press) A wo
man cabinet minister for England is
one of the possibilities of the near fu
ture. Wide support has been given
to the proposal that a woman should
occupy the oilice of Minister of HeaT.h,
which is to be added to the British
cabinet immediately after the war.
Lady Frances Balfour, in a statement
in support of the proposal,' says:
"We have lately reconstructed Vur
ideas as to the place of women in our
self-governing constitution. Who then
would be so worthy for the new post of
minister of health as one chosen from
among women? She would be repre
sented in parliament by a male under
secretary, and I think I can assure you
that our ideal woman health minister
would give her under-secretary plenty
to do, and her energies would task all
his powers of eloquence to explain to
parliament.
"A splendid vision of reconstructive
work lies before her. 'And when we re-
: member all the things that the new de
partment must handle, they seem mat
ters where women are the practical
leaders. The minister of health will
need tv be inspector, guardian, coun
sellor, expert on food values, doctor,
nurse, cook and sanitary expert. No
mere man is sufficient for all these
things. , If a man were selected, he
would need a cabinet of bis own, com
posed entirely of women experts.
Therefore we commend the better way j
the appointment f a woman in this
post of such national household im
portance." ,
Lemons Beautify I j
Make Quarter Pint
of Lotion, Cheap
Here is told how to prepare an in-
expensive lemon lotion which can be
used to bring back to any skin me
j sweet freshness, softness, whiteness
and beauty.
' The Juice of two fresh lemons
strained into a bottle containing three
ounces of orchard white makes a
I whole quarter pint of the nrtst re
; markable lemon tikin beautifier at
i about the cost one must pay for a
' small jar of the ordinary cold creams.
(Care should be taken to strain the
j lemon juice through a fine cloth so
no lemon pulp gets in, then this lo
i tlon will keep fresh for nronths. Every
j woman knows that lemon juice is used
, to bleach and remove such blemishes
i as freckles, sallowness and tan, and Is

I Just try it! Oct three ounces of

OVER THE COUNTRY
NEW YORK, Nov. 15. With only
three working days remaining for the
Y. M. C. A. war work, fund campaign.
the National War Work council issued
an appeal here tonight for workers
"in every state, city and town in the
country to exert heroic efTorts to se
cure small size as well as large subscriptions.
Otherwise, the appeal said, "the
amount necessary to provide care and
comfort for our soldiers in the field
and those of our allies may not be
realized."
Approximately $18 000.000 of the de
sired $35,000,000 Is yet to be raised,
and the council expressed concern
over reports that most of the $17,000,-
000 thus far subscribed consisted of
large subscriptions, "most of which
bad been provided in advance of the
campaign."
At a special meeting of campaign
directors today, George W. Perkins,
chairman of the council's finance com
mittee, emphasized the necessity of
soliciting small subscriptions.
Many a mlckle makes a muckle.
should be our motto all through the
remainder of the campign." Mr. Per
kins said. "While we doubtless will
receive other large contributions, we
can only hope to secure the remain
ing $18,000,010 by obtaining a large
number of subscriptions of various
amounts.
The central department, with head
quarters in Chicago, is leading the five
other districts of the country with
total subscriptions of $7,248,967, while
Ihe eastern department, with head
quarters in New York, is second with
$6 807.608.
Subscriptions rcjiorted from other
districts are: ; ,
Northeastern department Boston,
$1,981,893; western, San Francisco.
$395,000; southwestern, Dallas, $556,-
000; southeastern, Atlanta. $313,991.

The process of heating water for domestic purposes has been rev
olutionized in the past few years through the introduction and
perfection of gas fired water heaters, until today it is no longer a
a problem to secure an abundance of hot water quickly and econo
mically, in any dwelling, large or small.
Today, in the countless thousands of homes where gas fired water heaters are in
stalled, an abundance of hot water is available for any purpose. By some types of heat
ers the water is heated instantly at the turn of a faucet, by others, within a few min
utes after lighting the heaters, and all without labor, inconvenience or discomfort, ind
at a reasonable cost for gas. '

NEW YORK. Nov. 15. The new
ruling adopted by the stock exchange
authorities late yesterday, judging by
the action of the market throughout
today's session, seemingly had a ten
dency to curb the activities of those
who recently have been laboring onj
the selling side. Offering of this
character having constracted consid
erably, the market displayed more re
siliency, it being quite evident that
liquidation has apparently spent the!
greater part of its force, even though)!
temporarily. Offerings today except
at intervals were very light, while on
the other hand shorts expressed a
great desire to reduce outstanding
commitments.
The British admiralty statement
showing destruction by German sub
marines to allied shipping during the
past week as being the smallest re
corded since last February was rath
er gratifying, as were the reports in
dicating that the Italian army is of
fering more effective resistance to the
Cerman advance. There was a scarci
ty of news touching on the Russian
situation and the uncertainty of con-
&Te more inclined to operate on the
constructive side of the market. Not
withstanding the facts that the banks
had to contend today with the pay
ment of an additional 18 per cent on
Liberty bonds and which involved a
considerable turnover of cash, thq
money market assumed a normal as-
S'llHIllKlIl
lpect and quite naturally attracted fa
40vorable comment. We still believe
that the security price in many in
stances at the current levels probably
will discount many of the unfavorable
features of the general situation.
