a rumor and then the men began
leaving their places."
"The real difficulty," continued
Mr. Corbett, "is in the handling of
freight in the several Kansas City
railroad yards. The 175 switchmen
employed by the Terminal company
are employed chiefly in the handling
of passenger equipment, but the 1500
other switchmen affected by the
strike order are chiefly used in the
movement of freight.
"Several hundred carloads of coal
are available at the outlying railroad
yards, hut cannot be brought to the
city, where the demands of the
schools, hospitals and homes is great

they were misled into believing that
the legal limits of expenditures had
not been exceeded. It also charged
that more than $100,000 of the con
tributed funds were converted to the
"own use of some of the campaign
managers."

Realizing the ranchers of this dis

E. A. Tovrea company has made an
offer to them by which they will be
able to dispose of the feed at great
advantage to themselves.
The company has 2000 head of
Mexican steers which it will put out
to feed. Delivery of the stock to
ranchers wishing to dispose of their
surplus feed in this manner will be
made at Naco or Douglas.
The return the rancher will realize
for the feed which may be used by
the Tovrea stock will be proportion
ate to the gained weight of the steer.
For every pound gained by the cattle
the first 60 days tire company will
pay eleven cents. The prices offered
graduate according to the period of
feeding. A more complete price scale
for the feed may be found in an ad
vertisementover the name of E. A.

Among the good things at the "Y"

very useful for illustrating talks and

good use of it on occasion and it was
quite a feature of. the Current Events

Secretary of State
Baptist Convention
To Speak In Bisbee
Rev. H. tj. Morton, secretary ot
the Slate Baptist convention, will
deliver two sermons at the First Bap
tist church of Bisbee today, one at
11 o'clock this morning and another
at 7:30 o'clock this evening.
A man of wide experience and
travel, Rev. Mofton always has a
wonderful message to deliver to his
andience. For more than eight years
he was a missionary in China and
other foreign countries and his ser
mons usually are sprinkled with hu
morous anecdotes of the once heath

of humor, which, coupled with his
eloquence and limitless knowledge of
'he scriptures, maek him one. of the
most interesting preachers of the
southwest.
Rev. Morton succeeded Rev. T. F.
McCourtney, resigned, as secretary
of the State Baptist convention.
Cass Tourney Proposed
Interest in the royal game of chess
still keeps up. It has been suggested
to hold a sort of short-cut tournament
similar to those sometimes held in
the European chess clubs for novelty
and to relieve the grave and heavy
battles of the mast.ers. This is com
pared to a regular tournament, what
a contest for points is to a finish
fight. The method is to have the
games last only 15 : or 20 minutes
when they are judged by a master and
the decision given to one of the play
ers. Each contestant brings a prize
and the winners choose their own
prizes in the order of their score.
This is a novel and interesting form
of contest, besides adding somewhat
to the ' gayety of the nations" and
should prove popular in Bisbee.
The little room off the boys' locker
room is beginning to look like a real
library. There are now about 150
books in the room beside fifteen of
the very best magazines. Jerry Tong
has made two very fine magazine
racks in the high school shop for use
in the room.

Christianity Up to the Minute
Since November 30 will be consid

"Bible Sunday," it is no doubt fitting
and proper that a portion of this
space be devoted to exaltation of
God's own Word. 1
THE NEW TESTAMENT SCRIP
TURES. By A LAYMAN.
There are three revealed religions
recorded in the sacred Scriptures:
the Patriarchal, the Jewish, and the
Christian. The first and second we
find recorded in the Old Testament.
This Old Testament is divided into
four divisions, history, law, prophe
cy, and poetry which includes the
books of devotion. The Christian re
ligion is found in the New Testa
ment, in which there are also four
great divisions: the Tour gospels, the
Acts of Apostles, the twenty-one
epistles, and the book of revelation.
THE FOUR GOSPELS
The four Gospels contain the most
wonderful history known to earth.
There is nothing preceeding or suc
ceeding like them in the history of
the world. They stand alone among
all writings. The age of law, of
prophecy, of wisdom, and of nation
al power had long passed from the
verted, they must search the scrip
tures from the giving of the Great
Commission by Christ, to the close cf
the epistles of Paul. Here all bar
riers and race restrictions are brok
en down.
The Fatherhood of God and the
Brotherhood of Man is developed
and God's great love for the entire
world exemplified. The epistles,
then, as a whole, were written to
persons whose former sins had been
forgiven, who had been adopted in
to the family of God; they were
written to give instruction in regard
to their work and conversation, to
teach, them what they were to do,
to suffer and finally to enjoy.
REVELATION
The book of revelation gives a
prophetic history of the future of
the church, fortelling great calami
ties which are to come upon earth,
the sufferings and the struggles of
the saints of the Most High, and
their final glorious victory.
Of the gospels it may be sail,
"Those are written that you might
believe." The Acts of the AposMes
gives a history of pardon and ex
amples of conversion; the epistles
divert Christians how to live; and
the book of Revelation gives a

THE ACTS OF APOSTLES
The Acts of the Apostles gives
the history of the organization of
the Church, uu? preacuius
apostles under the commission
Christ, beginning at Jerusalem,
continuing to preach in the various
parts of the world. It gives the mis
sionary labors of the Apostles and
evangelists, gives the minute and de
detailed account of the pardon of
masses of people and of many in
dividuals. Here alone we can find a
full account of how the gospel was
preached, received and obeyed. Here
alone of all the books of the New
Testament are we told how persons
came into the church of Christ.
This then, is the book lo which the
believing penitent will go and ask.
as thousands heretofore have asked,
-Lord, what wilt thou have me to
do'" and receiving the same answer
will do the same things and rejoice
in the same hope

THE UNIVERSAL CAE
Out of the more than 3,000,000 Ford cars now in use, about
sixty per cent have been sold to farmers. Probably no other one
thing has brought to the farm so much of comfort end profit as has '
the Ford car. It has enlarged the social life, doubled the facilities for
marketing, brought the town next door to the -farm, multiplied for
the farmer the pleasures of living, and by the same token the Ford
Touring Car has brought just as much pleasure to the residents of the
towns and cities, because it is an every day in the year utility,
answering the demand .of quick transportation at low expense. A
family car without an equal in low cost of operation and maintenance.
We solicit your order for one. We have the full line of Ford cars.
We carry the genuine Ford Parts, and assure you the best in
mechanical service and the most reasonable prices.

The combined refined copper pro
duction of twenty or more prominent

output, despite the lack of demand
for the red metal and the shading of
prices by certain selling agencies. A
very large proportion of the metal
now being turned out merely repre

ready huge total of unsold metal in
the country. While exports are
bulking fairly large they are but a
drop in the bucket as compared with
surplus of the metal that is await

he combined production of twenty
large producers last month amounted
to 68,580.264 pounds, compared with
62,013.286 pounds in September, and
63,418,476 pounds in August. Those
tptals do not by any means represent
the total production of the country
for that month, as there a large num
ber of companies, especially the por
phyries, that are yet to announce
their October results.
This October combined production
increased 6,566,978 pounds over Sep
tember. On the other hand the Sep
tember combined output showed a
decrease of 1,405,190 pounds as com
pared with August.
Some of the companies listed be

DALLAS, Texas, Nov. 29 Though
crude oil has just advanced 25 cents
a barrel all over north Texas and
mid-continental fields, it is slated to
go to $3 a barrel in the early part
of January.
Crude oil is selling at $2.25 a bar
rel at Burkburnett and $2.50 a bar
rel in the Ranger field. The Texas
company cut the price to $2 at Burk
burnett because of lack of pipe line
and transportation facilities.
The price of $2.50 a barrel is the
highest ever paid for crude oil in
the mid-continent field. Twenty years
ago it sold for ten cents a barrel
at Spindle Top, in south Texas,
when the flush production became
so large that refineries could not
handle it.
Oil companies are now posting in
creases in price in Oklahoma and
Kansas.
Operators Bay the advance in the
price of crude oil in the north Texas
field was caused by the rising cost
of production. Labor and material
have increased in cost. Rig builders
and carpenters are earning as much
as $25 per day. Ordinary laborers
receive $5 per day.
Pennsylvania crude oil recently ad
vanced to $4.50 a barrel in the east
ern market.

Bisbee people became interested in

and assumed direct management or
the operations. In less than a year,
more than $6,000,000 in ore was
blocked out and the work was car

the proving up of the property, the
company decided on the the sinking
of a new working shaft to handle
the ore in the proper and systema

This work of sinking the new shaft
is now well undeV way. The shaft
vill be sunk to the 1.000 mark with

Agent for Dunbar & Company
1 00 to 1 ,000 dollars invested now may make a fortune! Big financial men of your state are already "in" Louis
iana oil. They have been buying oil leases and properties for weeks. Already many of them are tremendous winners.
Specultioh in oil leases is the biggest, fastest, fascinating, money-making business in the world. You buy and
own lease out-right. Drilling operations cause them to increase in value without your effort. Leases jump quickly
near drilling wells. You are the boss and can sell them when the time is ripe, without depending upon any one to
act for you. We can show you how to play the game on small capital.
Two years ago you could have bought oil leases in Bu kburnett for $10.00 per acre; they have since sold for
$25,000. Two years ago you could have bought the famous Baird lease in Homer for $250.00 for the entire 51
acres, which has just recently been reported sold for bette; than $2,000,000.
We own and have listed for sale the choicest properties in Louisiana, scattered throughout the areas of active
operations. Big companies are spending millions in testiig these new fields, and that other multi-million dollar oil
pools, such as Homer, Caddo, Red River, De Soto, Jennings, Edgerly, and Bull-Bayou, will soon be opened, is en
tirely probable. The time to buy is before the new fields come in.
We are on the ground. Thousands of dollars could not put you in as close touch with the true situation as
you can get through our expert facilities. - .. .
Leases with the big speculative possibilities will now cost you from $3.00 to $25.00 per acre. At $10.00 per
acre we can make you an excellent selection. As acreage gets closer to the gushers, naturally it costs more. We
ate now able to. supply all classes and for all purposes up to $25,000 per acre.
FREE LOUISIANO OIL MAP. Write today. Na me the price you care to pay and we will indicate to you
on the map we send the exact location of the lease.
You must act at once to get the benefit of present prices. When we first began running this series of adver
tisement four weeks ago, we could have filled your order 100 cheaper than it can be filled today. What the
nsxt thirty days will bring forth can best be judged by what has happened during the past few weeks, when an ad
vance of practically 100 has occurred all along the line.
We are holding large blocks of this acreage for our o 'f ice account. We are therefore urging all our clients and
correspondents to buy right now. After a few more gush ;rs come in it will be too late.
f'; t
Some of you know that you could have made fortun this year had you acted, on your own impulse. Why
wait longer? Because you missed Burkburnett, Homer, a id Bull Bayou, is all the more reason why you should get
in ahead of the next big strike.
SIT DOWN RIGHT NOW AND SEND IN YOUR ORDER FOR A FORTY -ACRE LEASE at $3.00 per
:cre. Of course, if you pay more you get correspondingl closer to development.
(B-R) DO IT NOW! ' (B.R)
Kindly send, without any obligation on my part, map
of Louisiana oil fields, together with full information re
garding oil and gas lease investments. I would con
sider investing $ if satisfactory.

BY REVIEW
STOCKS AND BONOS.
NEW YORK, N.jv. 29 The stock
market wad heavy, verging upon
weakness, in the lUrst half of today's
short session, generally as a result of
the materially lower range of prices

speculative leaders.
Early declines of 5 to ISpoints
Early declines oC 5 to 15 points in
General Motors, Ci'ucible Steel and
American Tobacco, with one to three
point reactions tlsfwhere, were not
conductive to buJlish enthusiasm.
Pressure was plainly of professional
origin, however, some stocks making
full recovery at the first signs of sup
port, while others made partial re
sponse. Sales amounted to 800,000
shares. .
Investment rails fere among the
first to rebound, tlneir improvement
being accompanied ly the publication

Aside from its sentimental effect,
another break in exchange on London
and Paris to new loav records exerted
little influence.

NEW YORK. Nov. 29. The actual
condition of clearinj; house banks and

HOW TO MAKE MONEY IN OIL
Organize your own company; don't
buy the promoter's "sioek"; drill
your own wells; you do not have to
be experienced, but it is vital that
you form connections with respon
sible, practical, reliable men of high
standing who know the oil business
from years of actual experience. If
you and your associates are in posi
tion to raise $25,000 for actual
drilling operations controlling your
own propety, send a representative
at once to Tulsa or wire or write for
full details. O. W, Edwards, Tulsa,

My friends, if vou are sad and lone

that there is nothing left to live for
and are on the verge of almost giv

templated. Labor will be affected

Commeni ing on possible relief of
the present condition by reopening
:f the European market. Mr. Camp-li-ll
prated that such relief cannot be
counted on before ro-estahlishment
of noiiflal conditions. Normal condi
tion must follow readjustment, and
readjustment in Europe will only be
gin constructively with the signing
of the peace treafy. So the peace
treaty cannot affect any immediate
material change in the world copper
market, claims Mr. Campbell.
Should the copper surplus, which
he I has created a gloomy . outlook for
continued prosperity of the mines,
re-
an(j i cause a decrease in the selling price
Financial troubles in Europe since
the war have directly caused the
shorter copper market. Mr. Camp
bell states that the rate of exchange
in Germany is but one-sixth of its
nciraal value " and that in France it
had decreased more than 20 per cent.
America cannot use more copper
than it is now, and until the normal
export is resumed the production
must ne cut.
Production of Calumet and Arizona
copper w ill he redu(. d immediately.
This reduction may be but temporary
and is not caused by the economic
conditions. r
A break in the roaster stack at the
Douglas smelter has forced the com
prny to cut its production. Until
the j.tnek is repaired the smelter will
bos partly crippled. If delivery of
pauy one year or more will receive
on Christmas day a $100 share of
stock in the Arizona Packing com
pany, the new hiiif million ' dollar
packing plant now in course of con
struction near Phoenix, Ariz., which
will have a capacity of 1000 hogs
daily.
Each employe will be given a
bonus of six per cent on salary drawn,
during the year. If the bonus amounts
to ?90 the balance of $10 will be
charged to the employ on the books
o f the company; if the bonus
amount to $120, the surplus of JJ20
will be credited ,on the books.
Mr. Tovrea, who is president of the
Arizona Packing company as well as
president of the E. A. Tovrea and

the new plant and is so firm a be

MONUMENT, PROSPECTOR, BURRO
IQfillUGllE, READER URGES
(By A. E. Zen, of Cananea)
Some days ago 1 read io the Bis
bee Daily Review an article penned
by an old prospector in which he
pleaded that the patient, lowly burro
should be given protection from
abuse by the police department. The
article was full of the deepest in
terest and timely, and the subject
should receive the immediate atten
tion of evey mining community west
of the Mississippi.
Alter paying due respect to the
docile burro, let us honor the old
prospector, and the rusty piece of
bailing wire, for many a prosperous
city, (and perhaps Bisbee the lead
ing mining center in the great
Southwest heading them all) owe
their sole existence to what may be
termed the Three Musketeers of Min
ing, always found leagues in advance
of civilization, and represented by
the prospector, the burro and bailing
wire.
During all these years, since the
days of '49, the mining industry has
been too busy digging the precious
metals from the earth, to give a
single thought to the fact that some
deserving honor was , due the pros
pector, the burro and the baling wire.
Many high honors have been paid to
the captains of the mining industry,
but not one word of tribute was
given to - the poor little burro, or
the rusty bailing wire, and but very
scant tribute paid to the prospector,
whose efforts alone has helped to
make this one of the richest pro
ducing mining countries in the
world.
City after city, and counties, and
even states today owe all their pros
perity and happiness and enlighten
ment to the , early efforts of ,we
three, the prospector, the burro and
the rusty bailing wire. Only the
prospector and poor burro could tell,
of the miseries and the 'hardships
encountered in crossing over ' a hot,
burning desert; or of the dangers
and the cold encountered in effect
ing the pass of a high mountain
range; or of the narrow escapes from
death at the hands of. murderous
Apaches in the early days; or of the
agonies of the long trail over the
dry simmering desert, with .the danc
ing heat waves causing little devils
to hammer on their brains and blind
ing their eyes, and causing them to
place their heads in the scanty shade
of a stuoted. and, wicked ,spine4-cae
tus hoping to get a moment's relief
only to' find it sitll more" scorching
nearer the hot sand; or of meet
ing impassable cliffs in the moun
tains which would necessitate a long
detour of many miles around to
where water might be found;; and
day after day the poor little piece
of bailing wire was nobly and un
complainingly doing its duty by hold
ing in place the pick and shovel and
frying pan and the old dented and
blackened tin pail which served as
a coffee pot. We three could tell
you of heart-breaking disappoint
ments, and of shattered hopes and
of suffering which would open the
flooded gates of all your deepest
sympathies, but we will noi; we will
oontiue to smile and hope till we
come to the end of the trail, and
even ever aftef.
Allegorical ly, it is not so many
years ao, (within the memory of
men now living) that we three, the
prospector, the burro and the bail
ing wire, after many weary days of
slow traveling made our way up the
slope to a pass in the Mule moun
tains. It was late cne afternoon
when we arrived at the pass, Just
as the selling sun was bathing the
mountain tops in soft colors of gold,
copper and silver; and as we rested
for a short while at the top of the
divide, we looked down the canyon
and across the valley to the moun
tains far beyond, and as far as the
eye could see there was only primi
tive wilderness with no sign or
evidence of human habitation. Not
tho remotest thought came to our
weary minds that some twenty odd
years henc, and from the identical
tpot where we were standing, one
would be able to gaze down this
eanio canyon and see spread out be
low a beautiful and modern city of
refinement, wealth and activity; and
it will transpire that we three laid
the foundations and helped to build
this wealthy little city nestling so
cozily. in the hills.
We wandered on down the canyon,
and as the night was about to over
take us we reached a narrow place
and found a rpring of cold, clear
water close to a tall cliff of rocks
which resembled a castle. Here wc
went into camp fof the night. A fire
was soon built, tho faithful coffee
pot' put on to boil, the bacon fried
and the flapjacks made and all
eaten with a relish not known to
civilization. Then a smoke, while
getting ready the bean ot on the
firo for the night, and the spread
ing of the blankets. Alter the
fatigue of the long day we zvqu
laid ourselves down and with a ld-i
look at the bright shining stars far
overhead in illimitable space, and
wondering what message they might
tell and the meaning of it all, and
of life, we closed our eyes in "blessed
sleep till another day might come.
A glorious new-born day came
forth, heralded by the joyous songs
of the birds and all true nature re
joicing, the great beauties of which
only we three know how to appre
ciate, for, sad to say, men who live
in civilized (?) haunts and worship
the false creed of self and wealth
will never, never know. We wan-
' dered forth along the mountain side
j searching carefully for signs of min
eral anu ai iasi we iounu in cret ucs
of the rocks the beautiful green car
bonate of copper, perhaps the out
cropping of a great copper mine.
Days of hard work were spent dig
ging here, (and later a great hole
was opened in the mountain side at
this spot), claims were staked, and
news of the discovery traveled fast
and far away, and cross the plains
and mountains. Time passed and
men -came and saw and went and
came again; and men dug and bur
rowed in the earth, and soon tents
dotted the wilderness. Wagons held
together with bailing wire and drawn
by scrubby looking mules, broke a
trail into the new camp, loaded with
the makings of a saloon and a faro
layout; and a little later entered the
squeaky violin, and the battered
piano with its uncertain tin-pan
sounds, and the dance hall was
born; and with the music came the
rustling of silks and the waving of
ostrich plumes, aid with saucy toss
of head, entered the scarlet woman
all smiles and wiles eager to lure
away the gold and souls of lonely
men; and who on occasions, tem
porarily abandoned habits of vice,
and with gentle hands ministered to
the wants of the needy with woman
ly tenderness in times of . distress,
suffering and death. Came later the
pretentious four horse stage coach
with swearing driver and cracking
whip, and seated alongside was the
Wells-Fargo man with sawed-off
shot gun.
Time passed and men dug deeper
and deeper into the earth and bur
rowed with tunnels here and there
underground, ever on the search for
permanent ore values. Scattered be
tween, the tents, .wood houses and
shacks began to go up slowly, and
it 'is related that' a man -who was
considering the question of the paint
ing of his house asked the mine
captain if sufficient ore was in sight
to insure a permanent camp, and
was advised not to paint his house
for a while; the time passed and
men dug still harder, and one day
the man was advised to go ahead
and paint his house, for a wonder
ful ore body had been struck.
The pendulum of time swung back
and forth, and entered the railroad
carrying a most varied assortment of
human and inanimate freight; came
the reduction works and all kinds
of mining machinery;; there was
heard the sounds of the hammer and
saw as business houses were erected,
and banks, and schools and churches,
and soon there had sprung up a
thriving city, where but a short time
before there had been only a wilder
ness. We three, the prospector, the
burro and the baling wire were there
and saw it all happen, and we were
glad. But we three are now widely
separated and have traveled different,
and let us hope, more peaceful Hails.
The spirit of one of us is supposed
to rest in Kvergreen, but who among
the living can ever know of the more
precious and more wonderful and
more glorious discoveries since made?
Thus ends the allegory.
So it will be seen by thinking men
that we three, though of humble mein.
have played many leading parU in
the ever changing drama of Western
life. There have been times when our
efforts have been loudly applauded,
and we have even received boquets
and small emoluments in the coin of
the realm. At other times we have
received only frowns and icy stares
and perhaps a glance of pity. It k;
true that we are-human aud have our
faults and failings the same as men
who live in towns; but the men in
towns have taken on a very thin
venee of so-called civilization r.nd so
feel themselves qualified to criticise
we men of the hills and the jungle.
We admit with shame, that when it
has been necessary for us to go to
town for supplies, that we steered a
course to tho nearest saloon snd
made our headquarters there for want
of a better place; but after days and
weeks of lonely solitude in the hills
it was only natural that we Humid

OFGHEVHDLET ON 2500 Ml. TRIP! TIRES BOOSTED
FOR STAGE USE
Indicative of the endurance, capa
city, comfort and durability of the
Chevrolet car, for which V. L. Smart
is local agent, is the following1 article
written by James Arnold of Bisbee,
which describes a recent extended
trip which he made in a fivo-pasnger
Chevrolet :
"I left IJisbee at 12 o'clock on April
the first for Mount Vernon, Ky. I
was going to 'El Paso from here and
then to Kansas City, and through St.
Louis to Terre Haute, Ind., where I
meant to stop a week with relatives.
"It was about 7:30 in the evening
of April 1 that I arrived in Hachita,
N. M.. .having passed two big cars
and another one broken down between
Douglas and Rodeo. There were five
of us in the car a five-passenger
Chevrolet, and about 300. pounds of
groceries, bedding and cooking ma
terials. "On the morning of April 2 we left
Hachita by way of Deming, arriving
in El Taso about 5:30 in the after
noon. We had a good road all the
way except a few miles out of Dent
ing, where it was very sandy, but we
had no trouble with the car beyond
one puncture. I went to the El Paso
Auto Club to find out the best road
to Kansas City, but was told it was
impossible to get there, so I had to
go to Fort Worth.
"We had good road all the way to
Fecas City, but from there on to Ft.
Worth it was almost impassable. Be
tween Pecas and Grand Fall3 we
went through a swamp.wit h the water
right up to the engine. It was about
600 feet across this water, and twen
ty miles from the nearest town. I
thought every minute the car would
si oo. We got into Grand Falls about
eight in the evening, having made
about 15 miles an hour from Pecas
to Grand Falls.
"From Grand Falls fo Midland
which was our next objective, was 83
miles without a house or a drop of
water on the whole trip. I filled the
car with gas and oil and mv canteen
with water and lert Grand Falls at. 7
o'clock in the morning. . About 20
miles out of the road forked or rath-,
er the trail forked, for one could hard
ly call it a road and naturally I
took the wrong road. I drove until
the speedometer registered 90 niiles :
and then I knew I had made a mis-1
take. The only sign of civilization I :
snw was a dead cow every now and
then and one vacant house.
"At last I came to a town, but I
knew it was not Midlands. At a gar
age I was told that the town was Ger
vin, and that Midland was 103 mile3
away. I was told to go to Eastland,
about 250 miles from Gervin, and we
passed through the prettiest country
we saw on the whole trip. We had
a regular highway, and I opened the
car up to about 35 miles an hour all
the way.
"From Eastland to Breckenridge
was .about 60 miles, and it took me
10 hours to drive It. I had to be
pulled out of three mud holes and
could not drive faster than a horse
can trot. I marvelled that the car
could hold together, and I told my
mother that even if It fell all to
pieces I Would still say the Chevrolet
was the best car on earth, for the
farther I went the better the car
worked and I had not yet even bought
a spark plug.
"From Br"f!:enridge as far as Big
Spring I can't describe the road as
there was no road to describe. I
passed one mud hole In which three
big tracks were stuck, two of them
driven by two well-known Bisbee
boys Roland Sullivan and Curry
Hargass. I finally got to Big Spring
and from there to Fort Worth we had
a paved road. This certainly seemed
good, for I had begun to think that
there was no such thing as a paved
road in Texas.
"From Fort Worth I meant to go
to St. Louis but I was told by the
automobile club there that I could not
go north, south or east, and hardly
west. As a could not afford to lay
over until the roads dried, I started
for Little Rock, Arkansas.
"From Fort Worth to Texicana I
should. Judge it to be about 250 miles,
and it took me four days to drive it.
We went over the "Dixie Highway'
but In what places it was not torn up
by road workers, it was washed out
by floods.
"From Texicana to Little Rock the
road was fairly good except In places,
although there were hills that were
believe no car but a Chevrolet could
have made them. The only signs of
civilization between Texicana and Lit
tle Rock were truckers and mules and
cotton.
"From Little Rock to Memphis was
160 miles. We had good roads until
we came to within about 40 miles
of Memphis. There we were stuck
two days and nights In one mud hole
and when we got out of it we had
to go south to Helena, Ark., and
cross the Mississippi river and go up
to Memphis on the Mississippi side,
about 150 miles out of our way. We
were three days making the trip from
"From Nashville to Mount Vernon
is 280 miles. We made ii in 11 hours. '
having a pike all the way, constituting '
by far the longest piece of good roiid i
we encountered on the whole trip. I
. "At Mount Vernon the speedometer
registered 2500 miles, and we were 33
days making the trip. On the whole
journey we never paid out one five
cent piece for repairs and the engine
never stopped once. When we arriv
ed in Mount Vernon the engine was
working better than it was the day
w-e left Bisbee, and if over I get an
other car it will be a Chevrolet for I
do not believe another car in the
world would hate stood "up to a trip
like that." , :.

A THOUGHT FOR THE DAY
"From Thee, great God, we spring; to Thee we tend
Path, motive, guide, original and end."
' Dr. Johnson.
A FATAL FALLACY
A CON VICTION honestly held by thousands of workingmen, which
is proving a large factor among the causes of the present
industrial unrest, is the fallacious and ruinous belief that "the
less work you do, the more you will leave for others."
This is a conviction held by large bodies of workingmen through
out the United States and England quite aside from any taint of
Bolshevism, I. W. W.ism, or the intentionally destructive and anti
American doctrine of any such radical elements. It is a conviction
bred of the honest but mistaken desire of many workingmen to fur
nish work to their fellows while shortening their own hours of labor.
Around this fallacious belief hae centered many strikes, in
creasing demands for shorter and ever shorter hours, and for a con-,
tinual lessening of the amount of work expected in return for a cer
tain amount of remuneration, or to be performed in a certain number
of working hours.
One of the most apparent evils of the tenacious clinging to such
a conviction by laboring men, is that no limit may be set to the
lengths to which it might go. With the conviction firmly held by
labor that the less work eaeh man does the more he will leave for
others, attempts by labor. to carry that conviction out to its logical,
ultimate conclusion, would eventually ' lead to a state of affairs in
which each man would be doing not enough work daily to muss his
hair, while still seeking to do even less work were it thinkable
that such a state of affairs could be attained before the achievement
of an industrial chaos ending in the suicide of all productive labor.
Dut this is not the only evil of such a conviction. Its most
ruinous result is the immediate curtailment of production not only
in the industry to which the fallacious doctrine is directly applied,
but to a number of other associated industries; for so complex is
our modern industrial fabric that all industries are more or less
inter-related, and it is impossible to curtail production in one with
out indirectly forcing curtailment in a number of others. And cur
tailment of production necessarily means the throwing of men out
of work.
Thus the doctrine that "the less work I do, the more work there
will be for others" acts as a 100 per cent efficient boomerang, react
ing on its source with crushing effect.
The fallacies of this doctrine are nowhere better or more simply
and lucidly set forth than in a recent speech in the British House
of Commons by David Lloyd George, that keen and sympathetic
observer of the laboring man's problems, who has pulled Great
Britain through so many an acute labor crisis. Said the British
premier in part:
"The world is suffering from shell-shock on a great scale. The
Habitude of industry has not been altogether recovered. We don't
make quite enough allowance for that. Men have been living a dif
ferent kind of life during the past two, three and four years, and
it is not easy to get them into a frame of mind to stand by a machine
for eight or nine hours per day. But I wish that that was all.
"It is true that hours of labor have also been reduced. One of
the arguments in favor of the reduction of the hours of labor I have
heard iu this house for the last twenty or thirty years was that you
would not reduce production and that, on the contrary, you might
increase production. 1 have heard it many a time when I used to
vote for the eight-hour bill for miners. I heard it on the seven-hour
bill, and I have heard it whenever there was any discussion on hours,
but, unfortunately, the fact is that although there has been a sub
stantial reduction in the hours of labor, you have had a reduction in
output which is almost in mathematical proportion to the diminu
tion in hours. Effort has got to be quickened, tightened.
".Employers, managers, foremen, and workmen, must put their
backs into it. One reason why labor is being induced to lend coun
tenance to that policy is one which is creditable to its intentions
and its desires. It ts due to the fallacy that the less you work the
more work thero will be for others. There never was a more fatal
fallacy. You have only to look at the coal trade. The reduction in
the output of coal is depriving people of employment. If it goes on
it will throw hundreds of thousands out of employment in this coun
try Deliberately to reduce the output means in the end all-around
unemployment on a gigantic scale. The price of food will go up.
The cost of material will go up. You will not get raw material for
the country. There will be no work for those who manipulate it,
transform it, and transfigure it into the beautiful things into which
I ritish hands can transfigure any material. There will be no work.
It is a disastrous policy for all classes. That is why I appeal to
employers and to workmen to get rid of this ruinous fallacy that
seems to sway the minds of hundreds of thoucands at the present
moment."
The converse of the proposition as Ihus staled by IJoyd George
is also true. For while restriction of production of raw materials
causes unemployment in the industries using such raw materials,
the reduction of output of the industries using raw materials caused
by strikes and short hours and idleness on the job, reduces to that
extent the demand for raw material, and thus causes unemployment
in the mines and other sources of supply, thus constituting a vicious
circle
And this is exactly what is now happening to the copper industry.
THE NATIONAL SWEETS INDUSTRY
A CHICAGO paper recently stated that 90 per cent of all the sugar
usmI in our country went for candy and soft drinks.
Reliable statistics from the sugar division of the food
administration show housewives use 70 per cent and industries
SO per cent.
Of this 30 per cent, only eight per cent has gone into candy. The
22 per cent goes to bakeries, canneries, soft drinks, cordials, ire
cream. Jams, jellies, soap, etc.
When the food administration tried to pile up a sugar surplus,
it made no gre:it headway until the housewife was reduced from
unlimited supplies to two pounds per week.
This restriction increased the demand for candy, proving it to
bo a food oubstitute, especially when it is also made up from nuts,
frui's, chocolate ;ind milk products.
National prohibitum ha largely increased consumption of candy,
the output in western states alone reaching $100,000,00(1 this year.
The capital invested in the nianutacture of candy in the states
west of the Mississippi aggregates over $23,000,000; persons em
ployed, 100 000; federal taxes paid, ?.2o0.00n. and'loral taxes $.".

PEPY'S DIARY IN BISBEE
Nov. 29. Up late, after a broken 'rest, which came, I think, of a lim
burger sandwich which I ate just before going to bed, and which laid on
my stomach like the hopes of the governorship upon Charlie Roberts. Did
find the sun 6hlning when I arose, and the snow melting, which was a relief
to me because of my thinness and the proneness of the wind to whistle
about my hones, from which it may be gathered that the last few days have
not been comfortable ones for me. To town, where I met Chief Kemplon,'
who talked a little about burros, but guardedly, as he is anxious to have
them out of the way before the women of Bisbee begin again to raise Cain
about their gardens. . To Rod McDonald, the attorney, who asked me
what paper in the country had the largest circulation, and so from this we
were led into a long argument, and I would have won, I think, if I had not
been pitted against 'a lawyer who is of a class which has been trained to
talk like a woman aud to take the last word pvr To Mr. Cassidy, who
told me some political stories which were very pleasant, and then to the
library, where I looked at the pictures in a woman's magazine and got a
mighty lot of fun therefrom. An offer this day from the fire house iu
Tombstone canyon to buy my lawn mower when the cold weather ceases,
as the firemen are going to cow grass around the station. But they promise
to pay me in vegetables and fruits from their garden instead of cash, so
that I think. I will keep it for a souvenir and may make more from it b
charging admittance to see it. Did hear today that the blanket of snow in
Douglas is still virgin and unbroken, although it is two days since it fell,
which only bears out what I have said about the. Sleeping Sister of the
Southland. Not much news today, it being Saturday, but some work at the
office, which kept me late but content. Honia early in the morning, thank
ful that the night was so chilly that my wife kept her head under the cov-
ers, which saved me from the usual dissection of my life and character
which greets me otherwise. No limburger this night, so that I may sleep
sound, while my dreams should be good, lacking the untoward lecture which
my wife did not give.

PAINFUL FEET."
A physician was consulted recent
ly by a school teacher who com
plained of rheumatic pains in the
legs extending to her hip's and the
base of the spine. She had taken
medicines and couldn't understand
why she was not getting well.
After a thorough physical examin
ation, the doctor diagoni.ed the case
as one of arch trouble, and ac
cordingly prescribed properly fitting
shoes.
In a short time the pains disap
peared; the fatigue that compelled
her to "crawl" home after school
was gone, and she was happier
mentally.
This case is mentioned to em
phasize the necessity of properly
fitted shoes, especially for those who
are obliged to stand for long periods
at a lime.
It is distinctly woith while for
teachers to keep their feet in good
condition, tor litis does much to ice

Dr. R. B. Durfee, school physician,
in connection with a campaign to
make the health of the children in

Seborrhea is deadly to the hairV
But Famo will stop it and make the hair and scalp clean and healthy.
Every person who has dandruff has Seborrhea.
It is the dangerous disease that attacks the hair roots. It causes
sickly, falling hair; and finally baldness.
Famo Destroys
Seborrhea Germs
Famo was perfected by one of the old pharmaceutical houses of
Detroit to kill this deadly germ.
It has succeeded in thousands of cases.
No matter how badly you are afflicted by Seborrhea, Famo offers
immediate relief.
Famo destroys the Seborrhea bacilli.
It stops the unhealthy excretion which forms in scales and flakes.
This is commonly known as dandruff.
Most People
Have Seborrhea
Famo will , grow new, healthy hair. It makes the hair soft and
luxuriant.
. Famo gives added beauty to the hair. It prevents falling hair and
itchy scalp.
Seborrhea afflicts most people.
Deep down in the sebaceous scale glands it attacks the hair roots.
Allowed to run unchecked, it is fatal to hair, just as Pyorrhea is fatal
to teeth.
It is not enough to remove the dandruff scale
The deadly Seborrhea germ itself must be destroyed.
Famo destroys it and nourishes the hair roots.
Famo is Free
s
From Alcohol
Famo is not an experiment. It contains ingredients well known to
the medical profession.
But until they were combined in Famo they had never been used in
treating the hair and scalp.
For three years Famo was tested before it was offered to the public.
By its success in thousands of cases it has proven that it is the one
treatment for Seborrhea.
7amo contains no alcohol.
Alcohol dries the scalp and hastens grayness.
Use Famo
Every Day
Famo retards grayness by making hair and scalp healthy and keeping
them so. -
Famo should be used every day. Its application takes but a moment.
No massaging or shampooing is necessary.
Sprinkle Famo on the head and almost instantly it is absorbed by the
rrcalp and is fighting the Seborrhea microbe.
Dollar Bottle
of Generous Size
Famo is economical.. The dollar size contains a third more than the.
average.

THE BISBEE DAILY REVIEW.
ALL PnDPERTlFSOPEHATED FOR
ENTIRE YEAR WITHOUT A FATAL
ACCIDENT IS THE REMARKABLE
RECORD IDE BY COPPER QUEE
Company Has Also Gone for 16 Months Without a Fatal
Accident Underground; Co-operation Between Company
Safety Department, Deputy State Mining Inspector and
Company Has Achieved Result; Benefits to Miner Great.
To hr.ve run ell its properties for'
a solid ycr.r without a fatal accident,
and to have gone through almost 16
months without a fatal accident un
derground, while an average of more
than 2500 men have been employed,
is the proud record hich the Cop
per Queen mining company has regis
tered up to date. When it is taken
into consideration that the company
operates a number of mines under
varying conditions, in addition to the
vast open cuts of Sacramenta hill,
the care which has been exercised
by the company and the co-operation
which it has received from its
foremen, shift bosses and the min
ers themselves, may readily be real
ized, while the facts themselves
show the worth, in dollars and cents
as well as in human life arid happi
ness, of the two words, "Safety
First," which have become the slogan
of operation of this company.
Co-operation Achieves Result
The results which have been .achiev
ed during the past year have come
from a strict co-ordination of effort be
tween the company's safety depart
ment, of which W. YV. Gidley is di
rector; the deputy state (mining in
spector, Ed. Massey, and the various
company foremen. Assisting. Mr. Gid
ley is the Central Safety committee,
composed of the following executives,
foremen and miners.;
Arthur Kotman, mining superin
tendent of the Copper Queen com
pany, chairman; J. F. Sinclair, J.
W. Toland. O. N. Alvin, J. E. Lin
ning, A. M. Smock, George Mieyr,
H. C. Javobs, Sam Verran, Patrick
Beecher, Robert Sisson, Frank Brand
enberg C. B. Shcpard, Patrick Black,
Theo. Krantz and M. Ferea.
This committee meets once a
month, when it considers carefully
everything concerning the better
ment of working conditions in the
mines and, in a special sense, the
suggestions which may be submitted
to it by the safety inspector and the
men themselves. Every employe of
the company is at liberty to make a
suggestion, and some of the. most
important operations of the central
committee have come from these
bits of advice from the men of the
stopes and crosscuts.
Instruct Men in First Aid.
The work of the safety depart
ment begins with a course of in
struction for the shift bosses and
men in first aid. Classes are held
continually at the headquarters of
slipped under the wheels and had
his leg cut off just below the knee.
Jack Radcliffe, foreman of the Sac
ramento shaft, was notified of the
accident and hurried to the scene.
On the ground near the injured man
was a . short length of rope, which
Radcliffe declares now must have
been left there providentially. Rad
cliffe used the rope as a tourniquet,
stopped the flow of blood, bandaged
"up the limb, and today the man is
working steadily. This one case
might easily have had ' a fatal end
ing, and in more than one instance
in the past men have died from
loss of blood while their companions
stood helplessly around.
While the safety first work at
first was not taken to heartily by
the men, practical instances of its
worth, such as the foregoing, as well
as the better working conditions,
more robust health, and a more con
tented frame of mind has enlisted
the co-operation of everyone.
Mine Rescue Classes
At the safety department's head
quarters are also kept pulmotors and
helmets, while a class in mine rescue
work is at steady instruction there.
Special ' facilities have been placed
in the building, for these rescue
workers, wjio number thirty, and
who are trained under actual con
ditions in the mines.
At the same time, a system of
percentages, with a bonus of $90
for the best average, has been in
stituted among the foremen. These
percentages are based upon the num
ber of hoars . of work lost in each
mine through accidents, and the re
sults are posted conspicuously where
all the men may see them. This keeps
the foremen and shift bosses doubly
careful, although all of theni, it is
said, have thrown themselves into
the safety first work with vigor.
At the safety first headquarters
with Mr. Gidley are B. C. Baker, his
assistant, who is in charge of the
first-aid classes for the miners; J.
B. Frank, who directs the first aid
and mine rescue instruction, and J.
E. Clark, who is in charge of the
reports and other executive details
of the office.
Benefit Association.
To assist those who may be in
jured, or the families of those who
may be killed, there is an Employes
Benefit association, the assistance of
which is given to the unfortunate in
addition to that of the compensation
the ; depart ment ; across from the E.jlaws- The dues are 2 per cent of
P. & VS. W. depot, where the men t the wages of the members, and in
practical
are' trained in practical first aid
treatment for themselves and others.
The men are paid $1 each for every
lesson they attend, and the result
is noy that in practically no part
of the mines or of Sacramento hill
is there a body of men working
without someone among them who is
competent to render first aid in case
of accident. ,
The worth of this system has been
demonstrated in startling fashion sev
eral times lately. In one case, a
Mexican working at Sacramento hiil
broke his leg while at 1 work. An
other Mexican, who had been attend
ing the-first aid -classes, put- splints
around the injured limb, bandaged(
it carefully, and Jiad the work done
so well that when the workman was
taken to the hospital, the physicians
declared Lhat the bandages would
not have, to be removed.
Saves -Workman's Life
In another case, a workman at
tempted to swing on a passing train.
addition, the Copper Queen gives
$15,000 to the association as long as
its membership is one-half of the
total number of men employed in
the mines. This association has
been of almost indispensable benefit
to the miners and their families, as
during the Spanish influenza epi
demic, when it went in debt to the
extent of more than $35,000 to assist
those who had suffered from the in
fection. The compensation runs up
to $1500, varying, of, course, accord
ing to the individual case.
"Safety First" Signs Everywhere
The first thing to catch the eye
of the visitor to the mines is the
number of safety first sy;ns which
are placed in every possible place
where they may catch the eye of the
worker. With these are different
sets of directions and warnings, all
with the thought of keeping before
the mind of the employe the fact
that each is responsible, to a great
degree, for, his own safety and that

of his fellow workmen,' and that
"Safety First" i a real and perman
ent investment. The practical as
sistance given to the safety first
idea by the company then becomes
apparent in the change rooms, with
their individual lockers, their shower
baths, and their cleanliness; the care
taken to enclose, wherever possible,
aty the moving parts of machinery,
and the rules and regulations which
govern the men in and about the
mines.
Ventilation System Feature.
But it is in the mines proper that
the efforts of the company are most
easily perceived, even by one unac
quainted with underground opera
tions. Every precaution is taken,
and no expense is spared, not only
to keep the miner from accident, but
to promote his welfare and improve
the conditions under which he works.
The first of these, and perhaps the
one which has done more to im
prove conditions in the Warren dis
trict' than any other one factor, is
the complicated, complete and costly
system of ventilation which has been
installed. Huge blowers are located
hundreds of feet underground, draw
ing the fresh, pure air from the sur
face and distributing it through spe
cial ventilation tunnels and pipe
lines to every part of the mine, so
that every workman, even when em
ployed in the most out-of-the-way
stope, is assured of a constant flow
of fresh air, which not only keeps his
lungs full of oxygen and increases
his working capacity, but also miti
gates the heat, which in some in
stances, might be almost unbear
able. This system of ventilation has
also resulted in ' cutting down the
company's expenditure for compress
ed air, as the workmen were in the
habit of using compressed air for
ventilation, which was expensive for
the company while it was also detri
mental to the health of the men.
Toilet Cars Forestall Pneumonia
In connection with this mention
should be made of any factor in im
proving conditions which may ap
pear of small moment, but which
has been of extrordinary benefit.
This is the use of special toilet cars
below ground, which are so con-1
structed and kept in such sanitary j
shape that they are odorless, con-i
venient and health-promoting. They
obviate the necessity of men going
to the cold surface from the warm
stopes, thus preventing colds and
pneumonia,- and their use has proven
their ,worth to be a thousand times
more than the cost of their installa:
tion.
As one goes down the drifts and
exempuification'of the virtue which
is said to be next to godliness
cleanliness. Every drift ' is kept
scrupulously clean. AH earth and
rock is removed from the tracks
whenever it may pile up; tools and
equipment are kept in their certain
places and in good condition; the
underground barns for the mules are
as clean as the stables of a high
priced dairy herd in the middle
west, and receptacles are provided
for refuse from lunches, etc. This
care has done much in preventing
accidents, especially foot accidents
along the tracks, which came from
the ease with which the feet of a
miner standing on a pile of earth
along a track may slip under the
wheels of a passing ore c-ir.
; Timbering Carried to Fine Art
In the great factor of timbering
and holding loose or dangerous
ground, the company has gone to
practically the' limit in its attempts
to prevent accidents. There is al
most no prohibition placed upon, the
use of timbers, or upon the time
taken to place them properly. No
holes are ever left overhead, all be
ing securely cribbed when they are
abandoned; "sparling" is driven
ahead on all timbering work so that
overhead ground may be secured
while the permanent sets are being
placed, and booms and other de
vices to hold ground are used lav
ishly. All manways are of the safety
type. The ladders are staggered
(set on an incline) and .offset, so
that it is impossible for a 'man to
fall more than eight feet in any
stope. The manways are guarded by
safety rails, so that it is impossible
for one to .fall in them, while spe
cial timber chutes prevent accidents
while timbers arc being raised and
lowered. All timbering is done v.n
soon as the need arises, while care
is taken to timber securely even
I solid ground concerning which there
is a suspicion that it may loosen in
: time.
Impossible for Rocks to Jsm.
j Breakers are placed over every
, ore chute, so that no rocks of groat
; size may jam in the chutes, causing
trouble and iossiblo injury to tram-
ticular dangers and directing in the ment to fix the blame and to remedy,
first aid requisites.
Powder Carefully Guarded.
Powder and fuse are kept in separ
ate compartments, under the care of
a powder man. A strict watch is
kept over the compartments, as well
as over the use of powder, which is
dealt out upon requisition only,
while the same method is pursued
in the giving out of fuse and caps.
On every level are safety first kits,
which are kept in good sondition all
the time, and which are ready for
instant use.
Should an accident occur in spite
if possible, the condition to' which
ciples of safety first, and the gradu
al co-operation which is coming
the accident is due. Thotographs from everyone, the magnificent rec-
are taken of the spot in which the
accident occurred, and then the re
sults of the investigation are placed
before the central safety committee.
In this manner the blame of the
accident is placed upon the shoulders
of the responsible party, while the
conditions which brought about the
occurrence are remedied, if they are
remediable.
Greatest Benefit Is to Miners.

the operation of the mines; the ef-

ren District Country Club, which has
a membership of approximately 300,
and where golf and tennis are play
ed daily.
Warren has an up-to-date street
car line which gives 30 minute serv
ice to and from Bisbee and a fifteen
mir.ute sche'dule cn all special oc
casions. Some eighteen mon'hs ago the
company made an addition to War
ren, known as the Third Addition. In
the older townsue 9!) per cent of the
lots have been sold and it was nec
essary to. add some more favorable
locations. The Third Addition will
have some G00 lots, which are sold
to employes of the mining depart
ment of the Phelps Dodge Corpora
tion and the Calumet and Arizona
Mining company. Money is loaned
by the companies to their employes
to build their homes, payable in 100
monthly installments with interest at
s.is per cent iter annum. In , the
Third Addition more than .forty n:o.l
eru houses are now completed and
occupied, while many more are in
course of construction.
Very few companies anywhere have

Residence lots range in price from
two hundred to one thousand, . with
a 50 per cent rebate provided when
a residence is erected in six months.
For the past several years this re
bate plan has kept down speculation
and the holding of lots without im
proving them.
At the original town site sale a
great number of lots were purchased
for speculation, which kept the home
building out. To overcome the
shortage of lots the company added
a second and a third addition. The
second addition was entirely sold
whereby each and every lot has a
house upon It. Along tho road lead
ing from Bakerville for a distance of j
several blocks, rows of concreted or j
brick houses were constructed, and
with the 6idewalks, fences, lawns
l and trees being put in by the own
ers, a delightful vista of beautiful
homes presents itself to the eye of
the visitor entering the town over
this boulevard.
The most important step tn' an l
the mining companies was the open
ing of the Terrace tract to employes.
Lots are sold to employes of the min
ing companies, and money to build
their homes is loaned them at six
per cent, or they may purchase the

Are you slipping at 50? 1
Can. you actually stand -what you could twenty yeari
ago when your strength and energy are put to the ftZif' ff3
test? 0T do you merely THINK you are "just as ffsV -f&
good?" Is your heart pumping pure red blood SW-JV' -yff4& j!
rich in iron through your veins? Or is it merely a WZm 'irAn'3 j
passage for thin, pale, watery blood without enough ,ff'?iJQl ft J3
red corpuscles to keep your body strong and well? folDi SSiX'TW
.Thcseare the questions put br Dr. II. B. VfonMrir Pb JJ" CrK5j
contends that a man's age caa no longer be measured y the
number of his years but by the condition of his blood. Dr. Vail
believes that the greatest problem of modern life is to yard oft
the tragedy- ct middle age, which begins to show its 6igns tho
.moment the iron in the blood runs Idw.
Continuing, Dr. Vail says: There are thousands whose bodies
are ageing and breaking down at a time when they should be
enjoying that perfect bodily health which cries defiance to disease
simply because they are sot awake to the condition of their
blood. By allowing it to remain thin, pale and watery they are
not giving the natural life forces of the body a chance to do their
work. Yet others go through life apparently possessing, year
after year, the elasticity, the strength and the energy of earlier
iays, for through their bodies courses the energy and power that
comes from plenty of red blood filled with strength-giving iron.
Iron is red blood food and in my experience I have found no
better means for building up the Ted blood corpuscles and helping
to give increased power to the blood than organic iron luxated
Iron which I have prescribed with surprising auccess for my.
patients who are approaching middle life.
Dr. John J. Van Home, formerly Medical Inspector and
Clinical Physician on the Board of Health of the City of Kew
York, says: "It is surprising how many people who do not get
along in life are in reality suffering from iron deficiency and
do not know it. To supply this lack of iron and help build
stronger, healthier men and women, better able physically to meet
the problems of everyday life, I believe that physiciaas should,
at every opportunity, prescribe organic Iron Nuxated.Iron for
In my experience it is one of the best tonic and red blood builders
tnown to medical science."
If you are not strong or well you owe it to yourself ta make
thefollowir.g test: See how long you can work or how far you
cau walk without becoming tired. Kext take two five-grain tablets
f ordinary Nuxated Iron three times per day after meals for two
vecks. Then test your strength again and see how much you
bave gained.
