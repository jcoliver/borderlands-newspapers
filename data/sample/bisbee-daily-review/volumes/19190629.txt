SAYS WILSON
No Authority To Act Until
Army Demobilized, Cables
President To White House
But Promises To Lift Ban
As Soon As Troops Back,
Probably By Summer End
WASHINGTON', June 28. Presi
dent Wilson has decided he cannot
legally lift the war time prohibition
ban before the country goes dry at
midnight Monday, but he expects to
do so as soon thereafter as bis
power has been made clear by the
completion of . demobilization.
In a cablegram mide public tonight
at the White House, the president
said he was convinced after consul
tation with his legal advisers that
he had no authority to act at this
time.
Promises to Act Later
"When demobilization is terminat
ed," he continued, "my power to act
without congressional action will be
exercised'
The message expressed no opinion
as to the authority of the president,
when he raises the ban, to make
hij action applicarie only to beer
and wine.
: Secretary Tumulty gave out the
following statement:
"The secretary to the president,
at the White House tonight amde
public the following cable from the
president with reference to war time
prohibition:
"I am. convinced that the attor
ney, general Is right In advising me
that I have no legal power at this
time in the matter of the ban on
liquor. Under the act of November
1918,' my power to' take action is re
stricted. The act provides that after
June 30, 1919, until the cbnclusion
of the present war and thereafter
until the termination of demobiliza
tion, the date of which Fhall be de
termined and proclaimed by the pres
ident, it shall be unlawful, etc.
Congress is Blamed
" 'This law does not specify that
the ban shall be lifted with the sign
ing of peace but with the termina.
tion of the demobilization of the
troops, and I cannot say that has
been accomplished. My Information
from the war department - is that
there are still a million men in the
service under the- emergency 'call;' It
is clear, therefore, that the- failure
of congress to act on the' suggestion
contained, in my message of the. 20th
of May, 1919, asking for a repeal of
the act of November 21, 1918, so far

CRAVEN: FIND BODY UNDER HIS HORSE
That a stroke of lightning, and not
murder at the hands of cattle rust
lers,: as was at first suspected, caus
ed the death of Cattle Inspector
Ollie Craven of San Simon, was the
news brought to Bisbee last evening
by Deputy Sheriff George Henshaw
of Tombstone, following the finding
yesterday of Craven's body, with
that of his horse, both bodies in a
blackened, byirned and decomposed
condition, in the foothills of the
Chiricahua mountains.
Just two week3 from the day on
which he disappeared, the body of
Craven was 'ound yesterday by a
sheriffs posse. Word was received
at the 'sheriff's office at 1:30 yester
day of the finding of the body ot Cra- i
ven, about 6 miles from his ranch and
i 9 miles from San Simon, In the foot-
hills of the Chiricahua mountins on
the San Simon side.
I The body of Craven was lying un
der his horse, which was also dead and
partly covered with underbrush, when
i found by the sheriff's party, who had !

became known, that Craven had mys

President Wilson was appeal

several times within the past

to attach their signatures witn

he concurred in the decision of thts

BOLT KILLED INSPECTOR
located in the southern end of what is
known as the Riggs pasture. A guard
was left with the remains, while one
of the party rode into San Simon,
where word was telephoned the sher
iffs office yesterday afternoon.
Sheriff McDonald left immediately
for the scene and arrived there abent
4 o'clock for the Inquest.
The coroner at San Simon formed
a jury and went out to view the body,
whichx following the inquest, will be
taken to Douglas for burial. ;
The body was found in such a de
composed state along with that of the
horse that no doubt is felt by the of
ficers that Craven was killed by light
ning. In the pocket of the dead man
was found a one dollar piece, which
was burned black and the clothes
were also burned in Buch a way as to
indicate that a bolt of lightning had
struck both horse and rider.
Craven's activity in pursuit of cat
tle rustlers, and evidences in his cabin
that he had been interrupted in the
preparation of a meal there, led at
first to a theory . that the inspector
had been done to death by vengeful
cattle thieves, and the offering of re

Sees Triumph Of The Old
. World Intrigue Over U. S. ;
Champions Cause Of Irish
NEW YORK, June 28. The League
of Nations wa3 denounced as "a gi
gantic was trust" tonight by United
States Senator Hiram Johnson ol
California in an address before a
mass meeting called by the league for
the Preservation of American Inde
pendence. He demanded the repudia
tion of the league covenant. j
Similar demands were made by
United States Senator James A. Reed
of Missouri and George Wharton Pep
per of Philadelphia.?
Sees "Germ of Many Wars"
"The league contains within itself,"
asserted Senator Johnson, "the germs
of many wars, and worse than that,
it rivets, as in the Shantung decision,
the claims of tyranny upon millions
of people and cements for all times
unjust and wicked annexations."
After declaring that under the pro--
pu.ea covenant ine representatives
of rulers, not of peoples," would gov
ern the world, the senator said that
by its entry into the league the Unit
ed States will enter into partnership
with "certain national bankrupts who,
after our first six months of meddling
and muddling with European and As
iatic controversies over territory,
have already come secretly to despite
and detest us."
Champions Ireland
Ireland was referred to by the
speaker as "a litigent of the perfect
case who can get no hearing," and
he maintained that it was the pur.
pose of the league to "use the great
wealth, power and blood of the great
democracy of the earth to retain re
volting peoples, without regard to
the righteousness of their cause,
within the governments and powers
of which they would be free."
After asserting that the league
"means that American boys shall pa.
lice the world," Senator' Johnson
said:
"This league means the halting and
betrayal of new world liberalism, the
triumph of cynical Old World di
plomacy, the humilitation and the
end of American idealism."
Senator Reed discussed the various
features of the proposed covenant, de
claring he refused "to enter into a
co-partnership with 32 nations not one
of-which in government, in civiliza
tion, in liberty, is the equal of the
United States." ' '
The Missouri senator maintained
that , the real meaning of the league
was that the government of the world
must be placed in the hands of nine
men among whom the United States
would have a single vote.
He contended that the race prob
lem was bound to enter into the sit
uation and that of the S2 nations
composing the proposed league, 17, or
a majority, belonged to the "dark
skin races." He referred to India and

PARIS, June 28. President Wil
son left Paris for his homeward
journey tonight when his train,
started from the Gare des Invalides
for Brest at 9:45 p. m. The crowd
in the station, numbering upwards
of a thousand, wildly cheered the
departure of the President, who
waved his hat to cries of "vive
Wilson." Mrs. Wilson threw kisses
to the crowd as the train depart

Complaint Insufficient For
Action In Seizure Of
I. W. W. Literature
The case of the state against Chief
of Police J. A. Kempton of Bisbee,
charged with illegal seizure, was dis
missed by Judge Allison yesterday af
ternoon, following a hearing in which
the court sustained a demurrur offer
ed by the defendant asking for dis
missal on the grounds that the com
plaint against Chief Kempton was
faulty in that it did not set forth suf
ficient cause for action.
The plaintiff was represented by
Attorney J. W. Ross . and the defen
dant was represented by Attorney W.
G. Gilmore of Tombstone. After
hearing the arguments on the demur
rer on both sides, Judge Allison dis
missed the case.
The caes in question is ' one in
which Chief Kempton is charged with
entering and seizing a suit case filled
with 1. W. W. literature at the re
quest of the federal agents, who now
have the property.
A large number of the citizens and
business men of Bisbee crowded the
court room and there was not even
standing room out in the corridors,
which indicated that there is a great
deal of interest being taken in cases
of this kind.
MORE TROOPS TOR
NACO ME ASKED
DOUGLAS, June 28. A tele
gram urging that more troops be
sent to Naco, Arizona, and inter
mediate points along the". border,
owing' to disturbed conditions ' in
Mexico, was sent tonight to Sen
ators Marcus A. Smith and Henry
F. Ashurst by a number of busi
ness men of the town, 29 miles
west of Douglas. The message
requested that the senators and
congressmen bring the matter to
the attention of the war depart
ment. Naco, besides being an im
portant port of entry,' supplies
water for Bisbee and several Ari
zona towns further in the interior
of the state.
A number' of ; local business
: men. met at the Commercial club
' yesterday with the business men
of Naco for the purpose of dis
cussing means of getting addi
tional troops at Naco.
With the unsettled conditions
along the border the business
people of Lisbee and Naco feel
that one company of. troops at
Naoc is insufficient for the pro
tection of the water supply of
this city.
The water works are situated
just a few hundred feet from the
1 border at Naco and constitute
the only source of supply of
water for the Bisbee people and
is entitled to government protec
tion sufficient for the safe guard
ing of one most important means
of life and health, the Bisbee bus

Other cities along the border
have been given ample protec
tion along this line and just re
cently a distribution of troops
was made but none were assign
ed to the Bisbee interests.

VERSAILLES, June 28. (By The Associated Press)
Germany and the allied and associated powers signed the
peace terms here today in the same imperial hall where the
Germans humbled the French so ignominiously 48 years ago.
This formally ended the world war which lasted just
thirty-seven days less than five years. Today, the day of
peace, is the fifth anniversary of the murder of Archduke
Francis Ferdinand at Sarajevo.
SIGNING NOT WHAT EXPECTED
VERSAILLES, June 28. World
peace was signed and sealed in the
! historic Hall of Mirrors at Versailles
this afternoon, but under circum
stances which somewhat dimmed the
expectations of those who had worked
and fought during long years of war
and months of negotiations for its
achievement.
The absence of the Chinese dele
gates who at the last moment were
unable to reconcile themselves to the
Shantung settlement, and left the
eastern empire outside the formal
purviews of peace, Etruck the nrst
discordant note in the assembly. A
written protest which General Jan
Christian Smuts lodged with his sig
nature was another disappointment
to the makers of the treaty.

In Almost Stolid Silence
WASHINGTON, June 28. Word of
the consummation of peace was re

scarcely a flutter of popular or offi

At ithe -White House and State De
partment, the news aroused only a
quiet feeling of satisfaction that the
pre-arranged program for the signing
at Versailles had gone through. In
Congress there was but a momentary
demonstration and on the streets the
Saturday crowds gave no show of in
terest. '
The story of the historic ceremony,
flashed oyer a: direct wire to the
State Department, was given to the
press in brief bulletins, keeping close
sten with the developments in the
Hall of Mirrors. The account was
brief and was made public without
comment by department officials.

A3 soon as the signing was con

the American people announcing the
long-awaited event and appealing- for
acceptance of the treaty without

And Freedom for. All was won over
there on the battlefields. It was won
over here in homes and shops, mills,

was won by courageous millions and
able leaders. But while the victory
. of blood and bayonet, or serving and
saevrifice, gave freedom to all, it
could not of itself breathe life ever
lasting into that freedom. This re-
malned for the leaders of the na
.tions gathered around the peace table
in Paris. It remained for them to
write the world, "forever." after the
freedom won by the warrior.
It was to this task that Clemenceau
and George and Wilson set them
selves. It was upon their shoulders.
as peace leaders of the three greatest

Clemenceau, Wilson and George, the
three men who stood foremost in con

Under the circumstances the gen

Ceremony Oeliber?tely Austere
The ceremony otheiwise had been
planned deliberately to be austere,
befitting the sorrows and sufferings
of almost five years and the lack of
impressiveness and picturesque color,
of which many spectators, whtiad
expected a magnificent state pa
geant, complained, was a matter of
design, not omission. The actual cere
mony was far shorter than had been
expected, in view of the number of
signatures whKh were to be append
ed to the trea'.y and the two accom
panying conventions ending a bare
49 minutes after the hour for the
opening. The proceedings were car
ried out without surface incidents,
since the Germans were silent and the
Chinese refusal to sign was evidenc
ed only by the vacant chairs. The
sole words to be recorded in the pro
tocol of the conference were M. Clem
enceaus short opening allocution with
its brief, stem warr.mg to the Ger
mans,1 and hi3 equally terse phrases
declaring the ceremony closed.
Ancient Goose Quills Scratch.
The intervening three-quarters of an
hour was marked by the scratching of
big goose quillr or modern steel pens,
which most of the delegates preferred,
and the steady procession of delega
tion after delegation to the seats at
the three taMes within the enclos
ures upon which the documents were
placed for signature
Huns Srgn First
Contrary to expectations, the Ger
mans were calied to cign first, and no
precedence was given M. Clemenceau,
President Wilson or Mr. Lloyd George,
who in the peace treaty appear only
as members of the respective delega
tions and discord the dignities and re
sponsibities which during the negotia
tions were summed up in the phrases
"the big three."
The two German delegates arose
without a word at M. Clemenceau's
bidding and placed upon the treaty
the sign manuals which German gov
ernment leaders declared until recent
ly never would be appended to it. It
was too distant to watch, even with
glasses, the expression on the faces
of the German plenipotentiaries dur-
the inter-allied conference.
The five great powers there under
are grouped separately, the smaller
states following again in alphabetical
order.
Classic Meeting Almost a Brawl
But, if tb" formal proceedings
moved with system and complete ad
herence to program, the same cannot
be said for the other arrangements,
which detracted most marktflly from
the impressivenesB of fae epochal
event. So many spectators iiac, i:i
one manner or another gained access
to the hall that the struggle for points
of vantage at times approached the
stage of a brawl, and the few officials
entrusted with keeping order had the
greatest difficulty in securing even a
semblance of order.
"Down In Front" To Dignitaries
Cries of "down in front," which
probably never before were heara at
a gathering of similar importance,
were addressed quite as often to the
officials of the conference as to the
unofficial spectators. The stage for
the ceremony was quite as crowded
as the spectators' enclosures, giving a
picture of crush and confusion and the
plenipotentiaries and attaches, intead
of arriving in delegations, formally

FOR WEEKLY NEWS LETTER
BY ALONZO CRITTENDEN
On returning to Bisbee, I have been
asked to contribute a few Incidents
of my experience as an army Y sec
retary to the weekly news letter of
the Y.
First, I must express my pleasure
on being back in Bisbee, and meeting
my old friends. Although I signed
for overseas service, did not get
overseas, but was kept "in the camps
of the Southern Department.
On briefly giving my impressions
of the work, I simply "tell the tale as
fwas seen by me."
In the vast preparations in this
country, the rising tide that brought
Germany to her knees, and made the
ly in the work of the Development
Battalion there. I would come from
the Y building to which I was attach
ed and teach English to classes of
Mexican soldiers often over GO men
in a class in the morning and after
noon running a hut at night. I also
had classes in French and SpanishJ
My Dig tngiisn classes were compos
ed almost entirely 'of "Mexicans, with
a few Spaniards, Syrians, Greeks and
Italians the'latter speaking Spanish
readily on account of, the great simi
larity between the two tongues.
Some of the non-commissioned of
ficers were detailed as teachers.
Capt. Newman, the educational of
ficer, in his official . report to Wash
ington, stated that without the help
of the Y Educational Secretaries it
would have been impossible to accom
plish the desired results in the De
velopment Battalion.
All the Y huts had something on
nearly every night moving pictures
three times a week and other kinds
of entertalnmenta. Religious service
was held twice a week, on Sundays
and Wednesdays.
. As one of the only two Spanish
speaking secretaries I had frequently
to address the .Mexican soldiers in
Spanish, giving educational talks and
interpreting general orders and the
regulations of the Medical Corps. I
would often speak from the open air
seated in a semi-circle around me.
Here is where the training I received
as secretary of the Bisbee Spanish
club stood me in good stead. Nothing
dragged a minute. The Y man sold
stamps, money orders, took care of
express parcels, pnotograph work.
Mrs. L. R. Blohm, wife of L. R.
Blohm, principal of the Lowell school,
accompanied by her two sons, left for
Beardstown, 111., where they expect to
visit until Fall. Mr. Blohm is again
spending his leisure hours at the Y
much to the pleasure of its many
members. .
THE HIKE .
So that our Camp brothers couldn't
say they had all the hiking, we went
on a hike Friday. We took our
lunches, a baseball and bat and
started out for a good time. We had
it, too. And the plunge surely was
good when we got back.
BOY'S DEPARTMENT PERSONALS
we welcome back Herbert Daven
port and his sunburned nose which
he picked up on the coast. Herbert
says that Bisbee is good enough for
him in the long run.
Notes From
Camp Jazz
JUNE 21. The V. V.'s arrived at
the Y camp about 2:30 this morning1.
They were all tired and tried to
sleep but Eddie Clement enjoyed him
self by shooting the half asleep kids
with a nigger shooter. They finally
succeeded in getting a sleep about
5:30. Lloyd Miller wa3 sick all day.
About 9 o'clock Saturday morning
a bunch of the Juniors arrived in Mrs.
Gilmore's bus and fixed their bunks.
Mike, the inspector, and Thompson
got them straight' , and then fixed
chow.
Mr. Thomas, who owns the ranch,
paid us a visit about lunch time.
Don't know whether or not it w'as the
foult of the grub but we sure enjoyed
the showers.

a field, and a new organization, the
National War "Work Council, leaped
into being to confront the giant task
that lay before it. Some mistakes
were "made, but it is contrary to the
spirit of the West to expect Impossi
bilities from any one organization.
I spent three weeks in the Secre-
torial Training School at Fort Bliss,
where the study of war work methods
were agreeably varied by short Inter
vals of physical exercise and the play
ing of games under the physical di
rector, and community sings. The
rest of the day, outside of school, we
worked, as the Y was short of men.
I graduated from this school, and then
drove the Y truck about 16 hours a
day, during the daytime making de
liveries, and in the evening convert
In? the truck Into a bus and bringing
talent to the different Y huts for the
entertainment of the soldiers, some
times taking a part in the program.
There I had the pleasure of meet
ing Jimmie Henderson,' who helped
greatly the morale of the men by stir
ring addresses which he gave about
his experieace in the trenches in the
early days of the war.
I was then transferred to Nogales
as Educational Secretary. The 35th
Infantry was there, a fine' regiment.
The work was growing by leaps and
bounds, and it was hard for the or
ganization to keep up with it. The
building accommodations were far be-

Anyhow, he was nearly always

done great work in France. He
states: "I do. not know how the Y

Their presence and influence in the
huts has been much appreciated by
the men. Their greatest field of use

I had charge of the Y activities at

French classes and I arranged a pro

was free.
The base hospital was situated on
a hill commanding a fine view, and
the fierce heat was tempered by the
mountain breezes. I went through
all the wards every day, loaded with
books, magazines and writing paper,
besides always having stamps to sell.
Everything beside, stamps was of
course free. From there I accompan
ied the 35th Infantry on troop train
service to San Antonio, Texas, from
which point I was transferred to
Camp Cody. All the Welfare organi
zations were represented there.
This camp was called the "Sand
storm Division" and was well named.
When the, wind was high the atmos
phere was filled with a cutting blast
of sand and dust, to which one often
had to turn his back in order to get
his breath. But this is merely inci
dental. I look back with much pleas-
special friends they allow themselves.
They are in great demand at hut
dances, truck ridings, etc., and they
seem to be greatly enjoying the work,
as very few want to go home. Now
I must tell you something of the
French people at large. There are
war widows aplenty. I had two work
ing in our kitchen, paid them five
france a day, which, at current ex
change rate is the equivalent of sev-
Uy-eight cents. I could get fifty at
that price. They work very slowly
accomplishing less than half as much
as an active American. Yet their
fields and premises- are for' the most
part well kept. The' country people
are very frugal and believe in stay
ing at home. The little village of
Trompeloupe near here 13 only forty
miles from Bordeaux, yet many of its
inhabitants have never been there.
They have a prejudice against travel
and I am told warn their daughters
againist marrying a man who has seen
the world. They seem to be a simple
Inoffensive lot, yet the home life of
the better class is In my opinion, ful
ly on par with our own. Kindly give
my personal regards to any inquiring
friends, and tell them I shall be glad
to have them drop me a line occas-1
ionally. Very sincerely, Henry Per

GEOLOGIC REPORT
On the 0. C Welbcrby Lands Mills CO., Texas Leased by
THE BISBEE-TEXAS OIL COMPANY
BY C. H. BRIDGES -Consulting
Geologist, Fort Worth and Tulsa, June 19, 191?
"These lands lie along: . the Colorado River, in
Southern Mills-County, about 10 or 12 miles South
and West of Goldthwaite, and aresca.silv reached by
public road.
"The surface rocks here belong to the Pennsyl
vania Series, though further to the North and East
the Cretaceous rocks set in. "
In drilling for Oil and Gas here, the first series
of rock beds to pass through are the red to brown
sand stones and reddish to bluish clays and shales of
the Strawn formation, of Pennsylvania age.
There will likely be 600 or JOO feet of these rocks,
arid some Oil is usually found'in them.
The next lower, rock beds are the bluish to black
shales and thin strata of gray to brown or red sand
stones of the Smith wick formation. These several
beds will probably aggregate a thickness of 500 or
600 feet, though in the Atlantic well a few miles
North they were about 800 feet thick.' A little Oil
may also be expected in this formation.
Below the Smithwick lies the Bend series, having
a total thickness generally of 400 to 500 feet.
The upper third is limestone from white or gray
to black in color and very hard in texture. The mid
dle third contains much buff to dark colored, porous
sandy lime, which in the Ranger Oil Field is a large
producer of Oil and Gap , and may be looked on as a
very probable producer here also. The lower third
is very similar to the upper portion, except that it
rests on a buff to black shale, 25 to 50 or more feet
thick, and which has also proven to be a good Oil pro
ducer in the Ranger country. This shale is very oily
at its outcrop in San Saba County and offers a good
bed to explore for Oil.
Below this shale limestone prevails for the next 1.200 to 1.500 feet,
with a good sandstone bed about half way down, which by nature
would make an excellent reservoir for Oil and Gas. This bed has
never been explored under favorable conditions and -hence no predic
tion can be safely made as to Its oil-bearing qualities.
A 3,500-foot test here will certainly penetrate all probable oil-bearing
bed of rock.
GEOLOGIC STRUCTURE
By reference to accompanying map you will note that two anticline
intersect near the Northwest corner of the tract under discussion, thus
forming a dome, which is the very best possible structure for an Oil .
and Gas reservoir.
I would recommend that you drill 250 to 300 feet Southwest of this

MIGHTY
ENORMOUS FORTUNES MADE BY MANY
OVER $3,000.00 MADE Oil EVERY $100 INVESTED
A few months ago several men got together, secured a lease in the now
famous Northwest Burkburnett pool and organized the Burk-Waggoner Oil
Company. They sold enough stock to drill their first well and a few weeks
later tapped the sand and the WONDERFUL BURK-WAGGONER well
gushed forth its thousands of barrels of high-grade oil dailv.
lnese men wno organized this company and who urged their friends to Invest with them, then sold

$25,000 PER ACRE FOR LEASE NEAR OUR PROPERTY
This Burk-Wagsoner well was quickly followed by many other gushers drilled in this pool. Nearlv
all of these big gushers are within a mile of the properties of the INVADER OIL AND REFINING
COM PANY-OF" TEXAS. Many of these gushers are only a few hundred feet distant frcm our tremen
dously valuable leases. $25,000 was paid last week for a lease on a single acre near us. Cie of our
leases is located in the center of a mile circle which takes in almost all the famous wells and encloses
a veritable forest of drilling wells.

On every side of our property derricks are going up over night. Actual drilling Is started just as
fast as machinery can be moved in. Our first well will be drilled half way between the 7.000-barreI
Texas Chief gusher and the Golden Cycle gusher, which is reported making 5.000 barrels of high-grade
oil daily. A 2.500-barrel well just came in a few hundred feet south of us. The Gray Gander "well came
in good for 3,000 barrels a few hundred feet west of us on the same day. We have room for more than
20 wells on our properties in this field alone.

PAID 32 CASH DIVIDENDS
The Invader Company of Oklahoma was organized in Muskogee, Oklahoma, about two years ago.
It began business with a paid-up capital of $60,000 and one . property with four producing wells. The
growth of this company has been phenomenal. It now his a capital of $2,000,000 and has more that 50
producing wells.
INVADER OIL AND REFINING COMPANY OF TEXAS
This company was recently organized by the officer of the Invader Company of Oklahoma. The
same men who have had charge of and so successfully managed the Invader Company of Oklahoma are
likewise in full charge of the INVADER COMPANY OF TEXAS. The success of this new company is
therefore assured. Our capital is only $300,000.
We own more than 20.000 acres of carefully selected leases in the Texas fields. One Million Dol
lars was recently refused for a half interest in one small lease near us. We own and operate our own
drilling machinery, tool3. motors trucks, eac; we have our own field forces. WE ARE ALREADY

UNIQUE PLAN OF
CHEVROLET HELPS
WORKERS TO SAVE
The General Motors Corp, haa in
auguarted a new savings and invest
ment plan for the benefit of its em
ployees. By this plan, which has been in
augurated by V. C. Durant, for the
purpose of assisting and encouraging
employees in saving and investing a
portion of their earnings, any em
ployee who has been in the Bervice
of the General Motors Corp. for more
than three months may increase his
yearly earnings ten per cent.
The employee may save up to ten
per cent of his yearly salary, depos
iting same with the company, pro
viding he gets $3000 per year or less.
Thus $300 is the limit to be invested
in any one year. This is done for the
purpose of eliminating the high -salaried
department heads, as the plan
was inaugurated solely for the bene
fit of the working man or the em
ployee drawing a yearly salary under
$3000.
Deposits may be made in the sav
ings fund in amounts of five dollars
or multiples thereof.' For every dol
' lar deposited by the employee, the
corporation deposits a like amount in
what is known as the Investment
Fund. For the total amount depos
ited, both by the employee and the
corporation for the' employee, the em
ployee receives interest at the rate of
six per cent. The amount deposited
by the corporation to the credit of
the employee is made over to the em
ployee in five annual payments. Thus
the employee, at the end of five years,
is given an amount equal to that
which he saved, and he has received
six per cent as a reward for saving
a portion of his income.
The Chevrolet Pacific Coast factory
has issued a circular letter to all em
ployees throughout the Western terri
tory, announcing this plan.
FORD HITS TELEGRAPH
' POLE, CUTS IT SQUARE
' OFF, BUT GAR UNHURT
"A recent newspaper dispatch from
San Jose told of a Ford car in that
city which collided violently with a
telegraph pole a foot in thickness and
broke the pole squareiy off, so that
it fell across the machine!- When the
pole was lifted off the car was crank
ed up and went on its way. somewhat
battered, but still in condition." stat
ed F. C. Bledsoe, yesterday, who i3
the local agent for the Ford in the
Johnson Addition.
"Such stories as this are by no
means unusual, however, for the man-
( ner in which Ford cars survive all
maunor of violent misues has become
one of the traditions of the automo
bile industry.
"Not long ago we received photo
graphs from Phoenix, Ariz., which
carried unquestionable proof of the
feat of a Ford in that city which
butted a street car off the track.. The
Ford smashed one wheel, but was
otherwise practically uninjured. A
San Diego Ford that was parked on
a hill escaped from a street cleaner
who was trying to move it and ran
for a block and a hali', finally wind
ing up against a fire hydrant. The
car snapped the hydrant off and came
to rest on it in such a fashion that it
deflected the young geyser from the
main directly into the window of a
drug store. The force of the stream
shattered the plate glass and the drug
store was almost washed away before
the water was turned off. The Ford
was dried off a little and driven away
under its own power.
"At Redlands recently I saw a Ford
that had collided with a big multi
cylinder car of more than twice its
weight. The big car was simply de
molished, while the Ford, was prac
tically unharmed."
NEW OIL FIELDS
NEEDED TO MEET
GASOLINE DEMAND
BAN ALKALI SOAPS
II G AUTOS
'AS
The. recent meeting of nearly 1000
auto and auto acecssory dealers in
New York marked a long step for
ward in establishing fixed standards
for future guidance of the trade, as
well as the general public.
That vigcrous and Influential as
sembly was representative to a high
degree, and the sense of its delibera
tions, as published, must necessarily
have nation-wide effect.
Of the several important subjects
discussed, that of exercising a pro
hibition of alkali "solid" soap for car
washing was by no means the least.
The meeting adjourned with the en
tire assemblage pledged to ban hence
forth and forever the use of all sticky
wasteful and ruinous soaps, and re
BOlved to a vigorous campaign to thai
end, determined, by advocacy and ex
ample, to get the public in the way
of using an autowash effective in re
moving the dirt and grease, yet harm
less to the most delicate varnish.
An interesting sidelight on this ac
tion of the convention with regard to
the advocacy of harmless yet effec
tive auto washing is the present cam
paign popularizing Kantmar Auto
wash. The Woodtite Laboratories,
the discoverers and manufacturers of
this remarkable product,- have been
busy lately proving its merits by a
series of elaborate demonstrations in
all the large centers.
REPORTS MANY SALES
OF POPULAR BUIGK IN
THE WARREN DISTRICT
Ed Plum, the Buick agent at Lowell,
reports the sale of several cars this
week, among them being a Ituick
Roadster to County Engineer Smith, a
light Six to W. D. Wood, a Seven-passenger
car to J. M. Mubeim, a Seven
passenger car to John Jerrrles and a
Five-piissenger car to Mr. Elsing of
Cananea.
Mr. W. D. Woods returned the early
part of the week from a tour tnrougn
Colorado and New Mexico in a Buick,
covering 223 miles, using 104 gallons
of gasoline or 21.3 miles to the gallon.
While this is not breaking any rec
ords, Mr. Woods was not trying to
pull any stunts, so that with the aver
age every day wear and tear on all
kinds of roads it makes an excellent
showing for the Buick.
During the last year or two the to
tal production of crude oil has iiot In
creased notably, although the demand
for gasoline . has continued to grow.
It is quite evident that unless new oil
fields are discovered, the price of
gasoline will probably not be lower
than it is. today.
The oil producers, refiners and au
tomotive engineers are fully alive to
the situation and are doing everything
possible to arrive at a satisfactory
solution. The oil producers are con
tinually prospecting for new fields
and refiners are bending every effort
to improve methods of refining which
will result in the extraction of more
gasoline from each barrel of crude oil
refined, and the automotive engineers
are ever improving automobile en
gines and systems of carburization so
as to get the maximum power and
mileage from each unit of gasoline
consumed. All the?e efforts are great
ly helpful in meeting the situation,
but in spite of them, the consumption
of gasoline continues to increase fast
er than the production.
Motorists are often heard to com
plain about the quality of gasoline to
ddy when considered in the light of
their experiences with this fuel some
years ago. As a matter of fact, the
gasoline of today in more powerful,
although less volatile, than the gaso
line of ten years ago. To go back to
the gasoline of earlier days would be

Power and.Where it Comes From
THE motor is nine-tenths of a. motor car.
The Buick Valve-in-Head motor is still
built on a principle that was evolved when
the motor car industry was originated. Every
passing day adds proof that this principle is correct. It is
a principle that is backed by scientific knowledge, by
twenty years of successful manufacturing experience,
and by a half million loyal, enthusiastic Buick owners.
Buick power, supplied by the matchless Buick Valve-in-Head motor,
carries the Buick owner wherever he wants to go, slowly or quickly,
quietly, steadily, irresistibly.' In all things other than power the Buick
, is equal to the best. In power it stands alone.
Ask any one of the half million owners of Buick Valve-in-Head
motor cars what it is about the Buick that most appeals to him.
Invariably the answer will be power.

ibi;tty browx and the champ
BY 1 BETTY BROWN
TOLEDO,' O., June 28. I've mt
the worlil'a "champion Mr-' Jess wil
lard and bless .you! he's :"just
folks."
He's also quite the biggest man I
ever saw. There IS something TO
that giant stuff! Mr. Willard 13 one!
And don't let anybody imagine that
this world champion fighter Is a great
big. ugly, terrifying brute person!
Absolutely no! On the contrary,
he's one of the nicest men I ever
met jolly, and kind and friendly,
simple and polite and well, just gen
erally NICE!
We Mr. Willard and I if you
please, sat on the porch at his Toledo
house, and conversed freely and
amiably about his wife, his children,
his Kansas farm, and his preference
for ladv spectatftrs who did NOT ask
him, "Do you like PICKLES?"
It's rather terrifying to be ordered
to interview a world's champion and
write him up!
One feels that ' one ought to do
something special about it prepare
and memorize a ' questlonalrre, or
think up clever remarks and "lead
ing questions.", i.
And then .one may have gathered
the impression that a boxing cham
pion in a vague sort ofbold, bad
man having to do with gambling,
carousing and all sorts of indefinite
Iniquities- It seems a bit adventur
ous and thrilling to seek out such a
romantic figure and actually TALK
to him! """
So today it .was something of a re
lief whpn" the "-newspaper people's
taxi drew in front of a big. comfort
able stone house in one of Toledo's
finest residence streejtsrrand the
the sporting editor said, "This Is Mr.
Willard's house come on" in, . folks"
and we filed Into the Willard. liv
ing room and shook hands with tjils
hurre, quift giant and began to have
a pood time! ..
Mr. Willard had a very Sunday
morning air! '
He put down the morning paper to
greet us and looked very freshly
shaved and dressed up and hadn't
yet rut on that stiff collar! His lit
tle gold collar button shone pleasant
ly and made us feel right at home.
"Did your wife ever see you fight?',
"No, she never did. She never
could leave the children and the
house long enough and she doesn't
care so much about it anyway. She's
home now taking care of the garden
we've got quite a garden and look
ing after the kids. ; She hasn't really
got time to come away."
"Dees Mrs. Willard still cook and
new for you, Mr. Willard?"
"She does, and I'll say she's the
best cook in Kansas. Of course we
have help. And she used to make
my shirts for me, too, before I could
afrord to lPt a tailor do it."
He touched the tent-like expanse
of striped silk that covered his, fam
ous ?.r.0,000 arms (each ' of 'em in
sured for $."0,000) and 'gazing on the
bulk of him one admitted ' that Mrs.
Willard must have been SOME seam
stress. Mr. Willard LIKES the women to
attend his boxing bouts. He says so!
"You ought to see the ladies come
to my last bout In New York even
ing dress and everything and walk
ed In as quiet and polite as at a the
atre. I like it. There's no reason
in the world women shouldn't enjoy it
is much as men. It's a clean game.
The women naturally like it."
Then he posed for his picture with
me on the front porch steps and fol
lowed us out to the car pointing out
the Episcopal church opposite.
"I'm going to church Sunday even
ing," he remarked and I know that
he had sat in a church pew.
Then we went away and smiled
back at Mr. Willard, the huge, sim
ple, kindly farmer man champion
boxer and a gentleman.
"Dempesy camp next," said the
sports editor, and In a few minutes
we drove into the Overland Club on
Maumee Bay.
And Mr. Dempsey is also "just
folks" a nice boy of twenty-four a
bit shy big, muscular, graceful, tan
ned to a deep golden brown quiet,
but confident in the belief that he is
about to attach the boxing title of
the world to the name of Dempsey.
He fights for the love of It.
"I was just sixteen years old when
I began scrapping," he told me "and
I've never quit. I love to fight. I've
fought for a quarter, or a dollar, or
anything, not caring much just os
It was a fight."
Mr. Dempsey gets "fighting mad."
Mr. Wilarld smiles. There will be
an interetsing test of methods on
July Fourth-a test in which "GRIN"
and "GROWL" will measure their
comparative efficiency!
He's 'not much of a talker and he
tends to .his. business which is get
ting Into fighting trim to scrap for his
ambition the championship.
Then this afternoon action.
We saw both Mr. Willard and Mr.
Dempsey in practice bouts with their
sparring partners.'
v It alone, was worth the trip to To
ledo! It wasn't "brutal, degrading, dis
gusting!" It was interesting, excit
ing, rather, beautiful.
There wasn't any bloodshed.
There was much rapid, graceful,
skilful movement, ' agility, power
PEP! . -
I liked it. I wasn't-6hocked!
Neither were the scores of other
women in the watching crowd the
same women who go to circuses,
movies, the Red Cross and church
just women.
I'll venture the thousands of men
and women who watch these after
noon practice bouts will all be at the

We have other leases but cannot show them

Only a small part of our capital has been ab

We will buy many tracts and drill many wells in

First Sergeant, Army
The story with which I will attempt
to entertain the readers of The Re
view this week is the story of the
three large embarkation cam pa and
ports of Brest, St. Nazaire, and Bor
deaux. Very little is known about these
camps in this country and as there
was little of the front line romance
in connection with them, there has
been little publicity given them by
the newspapers, and yet they consti
tute the most important link in the
A. E. F. chain, next to the operation
of the front line troops. v
It probably has never occurred to
the average person just what machin
ery was put in action when you bang
ed your knuckles on the door of the
largest hotel in the A. E. F. with
visions rushing through your mind of
mud paved rues, ever damp rooms,
continued downpours and harsh treat
ment by bellhops, clerks 'and other
necessary evils of America's greatest
embarkation camp.
But the "dope" on your train, if
you are lucky enough, to be one of
those coming home, is Vvired ahead
telling who and how big you are. On
your arrival at Kermour track in
Brest, an officer calls up the billet
ing office at the entrance to your
camp telling him when you will ar
rive bo that when you step out of
the train at the entrance to this big
hostelry known as Camp Pontanezen.
your rooms will be ready. While
you are gloading and emptyin
your mess kit at the docks and are
tramping your way over the famous
Brest road, your transient home is
being staked out for you. When you
reach your area you are issued
enough blankets to bring your total
to five, one candle for every six men

Was Different Story Early in War
In ;the good old days when we ar
rived at Brest from the States this
camp consisted of many tents with
out floors, no stoves, duckboards,
mattresses or bunks, with many leaky
barrack buildings, considerable- mud
and "Deaucoup" high morale. In
these days the need for materials was
great but requisitioning was slow and
unreliable and there developed among
the men on the job as a means of re
lieving the situation, a sort of second
story instinct which brought home
the materials and put them to work
bettering living conditions in this big
hotel. After Nov. 11th supplies be
Ran to loosen up and the camp at
y Pontanezen soon became, a respecta
ble place to live in, that is in com
parison to the places that the return
ing soldier had been used to during
his stay in other parts of France.
During last month 150,000 men en
joyed the advantages of this big ho
tel and it's a real man's job to billet,
feed and prepare for" embarkation to
the States this number of men in 30
days time.
By reason of the fact that our Pres
ident Baw'fit to land at the port of
Brest it is probably the best known
of any port in France so that some
of the American activities there may
be of interest.
Why Brest Was Chosen
The question was often asked by
visiting senators and promient citi
' zens who came to Brest as to why
Brest was selected as a port for the
landing of American troops in France
when the conditions there were so
unfriendly. Before Nov. 11th there
were two compelling reasons, the
first, it was the safest port from the
standpoint of submarine warfare;
second, it was the only port of France
that would admit large convoys of
American soldiers, sometimes as
many as 65,000 men in one day, and
it was one of the few ports of the
world, and the only port in France
that would admit the Leviathan.
Therefore, all the natural advantag
es of the terrain around Brest had
to be brought into submission by ar

tificiality through the construction of
water and electric light systems,
buildings, roads, docks, and miles up
on miles of board walks.
The American area at Brest is di
vided into the Post of Brest and
Camp Pontanezen about three miles
from Brest. The camp has an aver
age population continually of about
60,000 men with 450 barrack build
ings and 5000 floored tents. The
camp is electrically lighted and has
ample bathing and delousing and ad
equate hospital facilities. Every sol
dier is provided with a bed and mat
tress and all barracks and tents have
stoves in Ahem. These stoves make
very good ornaments and some tents
trtso have pokers and coal "shovete,
and occasionally we managed for
something to put in tha stoves.
Feeding System Best in A. E. F
brig. Gen. S. D. Butler U. S. M. C,
Btated to me one day that the pride
of the camp was the large troop
kitchens and when I was there last
April I found the feeding system
about the best in the A. E. F., with
eleven troop kitchens in operation,
each accommodating 5000 menand in
one kitchen I found that 9,600 men
had just been fed by this kitchen
alone in less than 20 minutes.
Due to the continuous rain at Brest,
and in fact all the east coast camps
in France, one of the most necessary
improvements there was the elabo
rate system of board walks which
connect all the billets with the kitch
ens and other buildings in the camp.
Statements have been made that
during the "Flu" epidemic at Brest
there were an unusual number of
deaths in that camp, and there is no
disputing the fact that many of the
men did die from this disease; yet in
considering the number of men hand
led at tht camp the percentage was
very small. The record of the camp
for November when the death rate
was the highest shows just a daily
average of 5 deaths for each 100,000
men in camp and. from figures secur
ed this April the, rate during., the
month of March was . 3 death per
100,000 men, which is far below the
normal in our own cities in " thisl
country. This showing was mostly
the result from the excellent system
of physical examinations which the
men undergo upon their arrival at
the camp. Each man is given an ex
amination every five days he remains
in camp and by reason of this any di
sease prevalent can be caught In time
to prevent spreading.
-All Go Through Delouser
Upon arriving at the Camp all the
men : go through the delouver, after
which they receive clean clothes,
mostly -salvage, then they must
change all French money into Amer
ican money and they remain'' In
quarantine until they leave on the
boat for home. During March of this
year some 3000 officers and 104,985
men . were returned to the- States
through this camp.

1100 Motor Trucks Supply Camp
The Motor Transport Corps oper
ates some 1100 trucks In supplying
the camp with the articles used there.
On account of the high bluffs at Brest
the construction of a railroad was
impracticable and the motor truck
made possible the large camp at
Pontanezen.
When one leaves the port of Brest
he is impressed with the idea that ev
erything humanly and reasonably pos
sible had been done to transform an
unattractive place to one of service to
the man who had to go through this
port.
Very little freight was handled at
Brest by reason of the lack of rail
road facilities, but at St. Nazarre
more freight was handled than at any
other port of France, having an av
erage of 3,702 tons a day for J917,
1918 and 1919, but of coure now with
a much larger capacity for discharg
ing freight; in fact I have seen 12,
377 tons unloaded in one day.
The port of St. Nazaire has had up
to April 1st, 1919, fourteen docks,
some ' equipped with - electric cranes
of 180 tons capacity each and with
lighters and other floating equipment,
as many as 24 ships have been in
process of unloading at one time.'
The engineers of St. Nazairs
have built some 5,424 buildings
. over an area of 32 million square
feet; they; have constructed 27 J
miles of railroad in ' the camp;
. they bave?lald :84 ' miles - water
- mains,. 43 miles of ' sewers con
structed and rebuilt 293 ' miles
of roads around and through the
camp, spending about $25,000,000
in these Improvements. -The
great Montair project 'at :St.
Nazaire surpasses anything of -its
f
where the "cootie" ends his
'
kind In the world, and contains more
miles of railroad than any other yard
and in many respects is the greatest
undertaking of American Engineers
In France.
In 1917 when the leaders in charge
of Base Section No. 1, (St. Nazaire)
had gohe over the dock warehouse
situation and discovered that not
more than 200,000 square feet would
be available for storage, it was read
ily seen that something must be done
to provide an outlet for the vast flow
supplies whWh-would soon be ar-
riving daily. Their first thought was
of car congestion, and with this
thought in mind a small yard of
twelve tracks was planned and built
along the line of the Paris and Or
leans railroad at Montair.
Build Railroad on Inundated Land
Hardly, however, had this yard
been built than it was found to be
far too small vfor the needs and plans
were made for a greater yard, along
the north shore of the Loire river
Here stretched a fiv-mile strip of
land, flat as a table, used for grazing
cattle, but which at high tide wan
covered with from six to twelve inch
es of water. The French ridiculed
the idea as not being feasible. Then,
too, the ground belonged to about
five hundred different people. How
ever, the foolish American knowning
no impossibilities, and stopping at
nothing, soon had miles of tracks
tracks laid on the bare ground pro
tected by a series of drainage ditches
and on April 17th, 1918, the first cars
were run Into the great yards des
tined to become the largest in the
world in miles of trackage and sec
ond in warehouse room.
On observer passing through this
immense railroad yard on the train
from St Nazaire would first notice
the large docks running out into the
Loire river. The 8000 piles and the
lumber used in the construction of
these docks by the 17th' Engineers
came from the Vosges -mountains and
from the forest of Oregon.""

On the left side of; the railroad
stands Camp Dodge,, housing the rail

posed of nine 'tracks of 2,000 feet in
length."1 Next is the ,; lumber yard,

tives are quite interesting places.

Rail Terminal Built In Six Months
The work of construction at Mon
toir began on Jan. 1st, 1918, and was
practically completed in June, so It
can be seen that this greatest of all
terminals was placed in operation but
six months after construction began
and the greatest French engineers
said it was impossible.
Until June 19th, 1918, no attempt
had been made to operate trains with
American crews, but on this date the
31st Engineers with 1750 men made
up of the most highly efficient oper
ators of the States were ready for
duty, and operation of trains by ail
American crews began at this time.
Inasmuch as train movements were
governed by the French who have no
centralized control of train move
ments, but place their handling en
tirely with the Chef de Gare at each
station, it was impossible to regulate
the movements of trains. Too much
cannot be said of the efficient man
ner in which the railroad trainmenn
did their work under such trying con
ditions. Every time a train reached
a station you had to stop the train
and call on the Chef de Gare, smoke
a cigarette and drink a glass of wine
with him, then maybe he would tell
you whether or not you could pro
ceed to the next station.
Yanks Play Trick on Chef de Gare
I remember one trip the 158th reg
iment took from Paris to Bordeaux
in, the famous "40 hommes and 8
chaveaux" in the month of December
when the weather was more than
chilly and there were cracks in the
bottom of thenars large enough to
throw a cat through, and the train
stopped at , some junction about 7
o'clock one evening at the same time
as a freight train going the other
way. This freight train had three
car3 of baled hay among other cars
and the nfen immediately came forth
from their cramped quarters at the
prospect of getting some hay to ease
up the hard places on the floor ofj
the cars. But as luck would have it
one of our old trusty M. P.'s was
TiroHfin nnA nrfiVAntoH tfia man fnrtm I
taking the hay from this train,' so
after a few minutes conference a
fight started at another part of our
train and while' the M. P. was look-H
lng it over two of these cars of hay
were very quickly and efficiently un
loaded into about twenty other cars.
As soon as the "Frog" brakeman dis
covered the shortage he ran for the
engineer and they both got. the Chef
de Gare, then the three got the sta
tion agent and the last I saw of the
empty cars there were sixteen
Frenchmen holding a very excited
conference over the great efficiency
of the German spy system. I

all the camps. "It is a pig sty a
cattle pen." That is the impression
that Pvt. Leonard Davis had of the
Camp at Brest and its sister camps
at St. Nazaire and Bordeaux. He
says "that conditions at St. Nazaire
and Bordeaux were even worse than
the newspapers made out, it was
enough to drive you crazy. In fact,
scores of the boys did go nuts. The
only thing that kept me sane was
the thought of coming home. At last
when we thought we would never get
out of that hole, I got so that I even
hated to get letters from home."
Davis described the conditions as
apalling. It rained in St. Nazaire
where he was located nine out of ev
ery ten days and the mud was always
ankle deep.
"In this constant cold drizzle, and
in the sticky, black mud, we stood for
hours every day in the mess line. It
was little wonder that the hospitals
were full of sick."
"But the thing that got my goat and
made everyone sore was a stunt that
they pulled off on us when Pershing
came to inspect ihe camp. The offi
cers wanted us to appear contented
and happy so they made us get out
in the rain and play base ball."
Davis Maligns Rain and Mud
Being at St Nazaire at the time I
read this article I took the trouble
to make a few investigations on my
own hook and here are the facts
about Pvt. Davis a 3 shown by the
records there. He was originally
with the 8Sth Division and went to
St. Nazaire on Dec. 14th, 1918. from
Base Hospital 27 at Angers, was sent
home in St. Nazaire Casual Co. 132 on
Jan. 17th, 1919, which shows that he
was stationed at St. Nazaire for a lit
tle over thirty days and never was at
any other camp, so that he could not
possibly have known of the condi
tions at all three camps. But that is
a small matter, his appreciation of
the truth is shown in other state
ments, so why doubt him? Pvt. Da
vis almost told one truth when he
said that it rained nine days out of
ten, but the weather bureau records
show that it didn't miss raining a
single day during the time he was
there. A small matter was overlook
ed while he was there. Someone
should have detailed an orderly to
keep him on the board walks which
surround- and connect every part of
the camp. And he even maligned
the mud,- for it is not of the stick,
black variety, but nice sandy mud
that splashes all over you every time
anyone passes you. But the climax
came when Gen. Pershing came to
visit the camp. Now the insignifi
cant fact that he did not visit St. Na
zaire until Feb. 2nd and Pvt. Davis
sailed for home on Jan. 17th, made
not the slightest difference In his
visualization of things to be. The
men had to go out in the rain and
take their little bats and balls and
stand for hours in the sticky mud.
The Commander-in-Chief and his
Staff are such simple-minded fellows
that they appreciate fully seeing men
contented and happy while doing
such stunt3. A small matter like the
parade ground being filled with sol
diers in mass formation would not in
terfere with a base ball game.
Then again the small matter oT
feeding some 30,000 men three times
a day might force some of them to
stand out in the rain for as long as
30 minutes, but honestly have you
ever heard a real soldier kicking af
ter he got home? t
He said he even hated to hear

the nearest to the truth of any state

he believed to be a real soldier, or
a fond mother who daily prayed that
her boy might be of real service to
his country whoever wrote those
letters, filled them with the love of
hearts that knew sacrifice, that
knew true loyalty, that were over
flowing with patriotism; and this boy
couldn't stand the gaff, couldn't stand ,
a few discomforts, couldn't show him
self a man. I just can't help feeling
sorry for him and his kind. I have

Handful of Men Organize Great Camp
The early operations the Port St.
Nazaire can best be told by Grig.
Gen. S. D. Rockenhack, in command
of Base Section No. 1 at thia port,
who writes In part as follows:
Headquarters. Base Section, No. 1,
A. P. O. 71, France. 10 April, 1919.
"Early in June. 1917, 1 was on board
to inspect and report on the opera
tion of British Base ports In France
and we drew up a lot of regulations
for handling our own, but I unguard
edly remarked that we had, enough
instructions and regulation to handle
a Base port, but what, we needed
were a few officers with brain and
brawn to open the port and do the
work. The next day I was reminded
of a parrot story. I had talked too
much and got orders to leave Paris
the night of the 19th of June for St.
Nazaire. There arrived here on the
20th of June. 1917, five officers and
ten clerks, That was the personael
which started this port, and today
the Base Section Is being operated
by 2.27S officers. 62.000 men and
nurses, and 10,000 prisoners of war.
"Wten you realize what a task the
United States had in this war to send
men anywhere from three to five
thousand miles from its Base ports in
the United States to Base ports in
France, and then across France for
a distance of 375 miles, a country
we did not know and whose language
we did not speak, and when you
consider the enormous number of
men and the great quantities of sup
piles, you realize what a task it was.
Urgent Pleas of Allies Answered
"This port started on June 20th,
1917. On June 26th, the 1st Omer

that the condition of this last Amer

were hardly able to get them off the
hip, before we had to send a Bat
talion of 1000 men and a band to
Paris for the 4th of July parade. The
demand for movement to the front
became more urgent and the Com-mander-inChief
ordered that the 1st
Division 'would leave the Base and
would be iu a training area on the
15th, of July. It was there. Things
moved rapidly and we had little time
to organize. Troops continued to
come. We secured a Marine Battal
ion for guard duty. The 17th Engi
neers arrived and it was placed on
duty here. It was largely due to that
regiment that we were able to plan
and construct this base.
"The valuable part of the training
of "an Officer in the' American army
is his ability to handle men. Amer
ica is distinguished for having more
kinds of efficient men than any oth
er coutry in the world. The situa
tion in France required men trained
in every line of work. "We got the
men. The problem was to put the
round pins in the round holes and
the square ones In' the' Square holes.
"Another great "valuable require
ment of the Military Profession is
that each one shall have a clear con
ception of his mission. If a Military
student is at the blackboard he is re
quired to write first what his task
it. On the 27th day of June it was
written ' in the Headquarters Office
at St. Nazaire: 'Required ti fit this
port for disembarking and forward
60,000 men and 300,000 tons of freight
per month.' This was increased later.
We grabbed efficient men as they
arrived and with the 17th Engineers
the work was continued until we got
what you see today.
"Every man that arrived came with
the determination to win the war.
With such a spirit ' and intelligent
handling failure was impossible.
"Many of the first problems of the
A. E. F. were solved here. ,
Praises Relief Societies
"The United States was doing ev
erything it could to help and all kinds
of -organizations were formed and
came over and they had to be cor
rectly placed. Everyone was willing
to work and in a short time aftr ar
rival they were at work. The direc
tors of the.Y. M. C. A., Red Cross,
Jewish Welfare Society, and Salva
tion Army, agents of the American
people, to place supplies in the hands
of its Boldiera, were taken on the
staff of the Base Commander and I
, desire to testify that here and at the
front they have done a magnififent
work. They are with us, a part of
the organization, and they have done
their work welL
" We have attempted something in
addition, which I hope you will find.
There is an old , saying, in. the navy
that an inspector will not'class a ship
as good unless he finds it a happy
ship. Also in the American Army
it is well understood that a command
must not only come up to the regu
lation standard, but in order for it
to do efficient work it must be a hap
py command. We try to make a hap
py command here. Due to lack of
ships we are not able to send our men
as rapidly as they desire, but we
believe that our government is doing
all in its power to remedy that. In
the meantime our task is to send our
comrades home as expeditiously, clean
and comfortable as possible.

port hold the sack. They will, prob
ably be the last to return but we are

Story of Bordeaux
The story of Bordeaux is almost a
repititlon of that of St Nazaire, with
immense docks for unloading ten
ships at the same time, and. 140 miles
of railroad trackage in the yards and
practically a iplicate camp of the
other two.
Probably the most interesting
thing at Bordeaux to the returning
soldier' is the delousing plant which
is the same as those at all the camps
pnly much larger. As maay as 13,000
men in one day have been put
through, the Delouser; or "Mill" as it
is called by the soldier.-
This Mill is the place where .the
men shed the much talked of "cootie"
and receive their clothing and equip
ment preparatory to coming home.
The Mill resulted from the necessi
ty of eliminating the cootie from the
clothing of the men before- they re
turned to the States, so that on enter
ing the embarkation ..camp they are
first taken to the barracks they will
occupy, and leave all metal, such as
rifles and bayonets, aid then they are
taken to the entrance to the mill.
' At this first of a Ion series of
rooms all excess and unserviceable
clothing is taken up and turned over
to the Salvage plant. Then the men
place all their clothes and equipment
in a barracks bag, except shoes, which
they wear. This clothing Is placed
on a small flat car which is moved
into an airtight room and live steam
mixed with gasoline vapor is turned
into the room and remains there for
. half an hour.
In the meantime, the mea clothed
in a pair of shoes, start on the jour
ney through the Mill. First comes an
antiseptic bath in water which Is el
their ice cold or boiling hot, unless
you are lucky, then it is Just about
right.

DEHPSEY HAS FORTUNE IN STORE IF
HE CAN BEAT WILLARD EXT F
DAY
Coming Match In Toledo Dwarfs All Previous Champion
Battles In Realm of Finance; "Gate" To Pass The
Million Dollar Mark; $100,000 For Willarcl
TOLEDO, June 28. Jess Willard,
the Kansas giant, will defend his title
of world's heavyweight fistic cham
pion against the challenger, Jack
Dempsey of Utah, here next Friday
afternoon. Both Willard and Demp
sey have been earnestly training in
thi viciniyr for several weeks past.
Neither on has left anything untried
or undone in order to get himself into
the best possible condition for the
encounter, the outcome of which will
mean so much for the victor. By win
ning from Jack Johnson at Havana,
Cuba, four years ago, Willard was
placed in a position to begin building
up an immense fortune and should
Dempsey capture the title there is no
telling how much wealth he may ac
cumulate in these days of high fin
ance, when sport promoters talk of the
"sky" as the limit for big events.
"Gate" to Pass Million Mark
Aside from the actual purse money
of $127,500 signed for by the two pug
ilists, $100,000 of which is guaranteed
to Willard, win, lose or draw, the en
ormous amount of cash which will be
handled in connection with the com
ing bout, dwarfs all previous ring con-'
tests into financial oblivion. .The :
"gate," from the sale of tickets and ',
concessions, is expected to pass the
one million dollar mark, which would
make the receipts of previous fistic
carnivals look very small in compari
son. Tex Rickard, the daring promoter
who is bringing the two big men to
gether in this bout, generally does
things on a large scale. He secured
the Johnson-Jeffries fight for a guar
antee of 100,00O and at Reno, his re
ceipts amounted to $270,000. Of course
the promoter was at an enormous
outlay in bringing that contest to an
issue, having been forced almost at a
moment's notice, to move from Cali
fornia to another state, in order to
secure a battle ground. Rickard's
outlay for the coming battle including ;
guaranteed purse, cost of arena con
struction, advertising and other ex
penses will amount to a vast sum.
The casual observer might think that
tho promoter will still have a big mar
gin of profit out of the charges for
admission. At first glance this seems
reasonable but Rickard is going to
pay the regular war tax of 10 per cent
on all tickets purchased and has guar
anteed the local authorities a percent
age also. The United States govern
ment, however, will have a 'big claim
for income tax so that when every
thing is deducted from the "gate,"
Rickard'B margin of profit probably
will fall far short of the results he
attained in some of his previous ven
tures. , . . Ring Reduced to 20 Feet
Some changes have been made In
the conditions governing the bout
since the original articles were issued,
the most important being the limit
ing of the contest to 12 rounds and
the reduction of the size of the ring
to 20 feet square. Originally the men
were to have gone' 20 or more rounds
and the intention' was to have a roeu-
lation . 24-foot ring. Otherwise the 1
agreement stands as signed by Rick
ard, Willard and Dempsey, each being
entitled to a third of the moving pic
ture privileges. Willard is guaranteed
$100,000 and Dempsey $27,500.
When the men step into the ring on
Friday, each will have a big following
of partisans. Those who rely on
cal examinations and any man show
ing a sign of physical defects goes out
a side door to a waiting ambulance
and to the hospital, the others who
pass the examinations continue
through a series of warehouses and
are given an article of clothing in
each place until they finally, come
out with a complete clean outfit. The
clothing which has gone through the
delousing process is then taken out
of the steam room and givea baek
to the previous owner.
"When Do Wt Go Homt?';
The men are kept In the debarka
tion camp after going through the
Mill, until they sail for home and' the
question of "When do we go home?"
is always the chief topic of conversa
tion. Movements of troops are regu
lated by the number of ships arriv
ing so that the movement is spasmod
ic at times.
The city of Bordeaux, made famous
by its purity of wine, is a most in
teresting city. It contains many mon
umental memories of the genius fo
Papoleon, such as the cobblestone
road . down to Portugal, and
a wonderfully constructed bridge
across the Gironde river, both built
by the "Man of Destiny." In one of
the dungeons, in the base of a tower
of the largest cathedral are some 50
mummies which are ever interesting
to the tourist. The story is told that
these mummies are the remains of
people who refused to ohserve the
mandate of the Catholic church some
400 years ago and were buried alive
in the church yard.
Arsenic Preserves Bodies
The soil contained such quantities
of arsenic and lime that the bodies
were perfectly preserved and were
later removed to this dungeon for the
inspection of those who might have
in mind a similar thought.
Another interesting feature of the
American occupation at this city is
the American police force which has
taken over the policing of the entire
city from the French municipal gov
ernment A battalion of former po
lice officers made up the personnel
of this unit and they were working
very harmoniously with the French
and gave far more efficient policing
of the city than fhe French officers
did.
Willard's retaining his title, insist
that he is invulnerable to punishment
and that Dempsey will fail to reach
his burly opponent wilh an effective
blow. Many of them aLso claim that
Willard has never hit a human being
with the full force of which his huge
frame is capable. It is said that once
during his preparation for a previous
contest Willard lost his temper on be
ing stung by the blow of a sparring
partner. Then the big fellow landed
a vicious swing which swept his op
ponent and one of the ring posts to a
spot several yards away from the ring
side and that the "partner" needed
medical attention for many days aft
erward. Dempsey 24, Willard 40
Dempsey's friends, and they are
legion, confidently state that no man.
however big, or strong, can withstand
the impact of a full weight hook or
look for a quick ending to the contest
with Dempsey a winner. They say
that Jack can land on Willard's jaw
just a" effectively as he did on Ful
ton's 'last year. They rely on Jack's
Tearfulness as a big asset in conjunc
tion with his heavy hitting power.
Dempsey's youth also is one of the
arguments his adherents Advance as
being a decided factor in his favor as
Dempsey is 24 years old. There are
conflicting statements as to Willard's
exact age, but It is the general belief
that the Kansan has passed the 40
year mark.
Dempsey has taken part in many
ring contests during the last four
years, while Willard has fought only
twice within that period. Jess won
the championship from Johnson at
Havana, Cuba, In April. 1915. That
battle lasted 26 rounds. Just 11
months later Willard met Frank Mo
ran for ten rounds at the Madison
Square Garden, New York. This was
a no decision contest but Moran aa
so far outclassed on that occasion
that there was no question as to Wil
lards having won decisively. Since
that time, March 25. 1916. Willard has
not defended his title. Thousands of
fistic patrons believe that thi3 pro
tracted absence from fighting has had
a deteriorating effect on the big
champion's abilities, 'ttTiile- Dempsey,
having been in ring action almost
constantly, will be in much better
condition.
Dempsey Fought 16 Battles in Year
Dempsey fought 16 ring battles last
year and scored 13 knockouts. One
of these, with Arthur Pelky at Den
ver, went 15 rounds; two of them end
ed in the sixth, Carl Morris and Bill
Brennan being the victoms, but eight
of them were abruptly finished in the
opening round. In addition to the
three mentioned pugilists, Dempsey
scored knockouts on Fred Fulton,
Jim Flynn, Porky Flynn, Terry Kel
lar. Battling Levinsky and Ounbcat
Smith.

PCTURES
RIO DE JANEIRO, BRAZIL, June
1. (Correspondence of the Associated
Press). A North American arriving
in Rio de Janerio and traversing the
main street of the city Avenida Rio
Branco can with little mental effort
imagine himself in New York, Boston,
San Francisco, or almost any city of
the United States, owing to the ex
tensive use of American-made moving
picture films, which have in the last t
three years become exceedingly pop
ular, to the exclusion of European
made films.
Moving picture theatres, or cineo
matographs as they are known here.
line both sides of the avenida in the j
section where it passeB through the ;
heart of the downtown district. Large
posters with the names a Jd pictures (
of North American movie stars, are to I
be seen in almost every direction '
The Brazilians have their favorites,
know, their respective qualities and
can, in fact, converse as knowingly
of the North American moving pic
ture world as can the enthusiasts of
the United States.
In addition to the amusement they
afford, the American-made films are
accomplishing something of perhaps
more importance. They are stimu
lating many Brazilian to a desire to
learn the English language.
Although the captions and written
explanations on each film are almost
compltely translated into Portugese,
this cannot be done so easily and ec
onomically with the large posters and
therefore the prospective patrou is of
ten confronted with the necessity of
reading the English if he wants t
know something about the picture bt
fore purchasing his ticket.
ThL and the fact that occasionally
In the captions English expressions
are not translated, has resulted in
Brazilians learning just enough En
glish to create a desire for more.
Added to this is the apparent exten
tion of North American and English
commercial interests in Brazil. For
eign language schools attribute to
these causes the constantly increas
ing number of English language students.

JUDGES
In March last a case which attracted wide attention came before
Justice Darling, one of the high court judges of England, on appeal.
A soldier, on going to war, had turned over to hit ' wife's care .
13500, his life's savings. While the husband was fighting for his coun
try the wife became infatuated with another man, made presents out of
the money to him, then went to live with her paramour and was posing
as his wife when the husband returned from the war.
The lower court had sentenced the woman to prison for 15 months
on a charge of larceny and the paramour for 12 montha for receiving
stolen property.
Justice Darling overruled the sentences holding that at the time she
disposed of the money the legal presumption was that she was "living
with" her husband and therefore she committed no crime.
The other day In Cambridge, England, Lieutenant Francis B. Wright,
M. C, and his brother took sub-Lieutenant Desmond B. Kinahan out
into the woods, stripped him, chained him to a tree, tarred and feathered
him in what the British term "American fashion" and then turned him
loose.
Lieutenant Wright has been summoned before a military court to
answer for his conduct.
He says if Kinahan had been a full sized man he would have thrashed
him and then ishot him, but as he is a runt and a coward he and his
brother, who' lost a leg in the war, determined on tarring and feather
ing him.
Kinahan, they say, had been associating with Mrs. Wright, had been
warned and threatened and once had given a written pledge to keep
away from her but persisted in visiting her. Therefore the brothers de
termined to take the law into their own hands.
A Judge who strains the law and defeats the spirit of it brings the
law into contempt. Who can blame Lieutenant Wright for taking the
law into his own hands when one of the leading jurists of tl)e empire
determined a woman and her paramour guiltless on the practically irrel
evant fact of the date of her open blazoning of her unfaithfulness?
All England rang with the echoes of Justice Darlin's decision. Now
comes an injured husband a soldier who tars and feathers the de
stroyer of his home and for that act he may go to prison or be cashiered.
The law is not justice when a jurist, through a technicality, works in
justice. The judge who decides as did Justice Darling promotes lawless
ness by bringing the law into contempt.
Incidentally, while the British are aghast at the method the Wrights
employed to punish Kinahan, and they characterize tarring and feather
ing as American, it is no such thing. It is EnglisbNand was English cen
turies before Columbus was born, for it was the method Richard of the
Lion Heart used ia dealing with thieves and possibly , it antedated that
great Crusader.
THE SCRAP OF PAPER ONCE MORE
At the opening of the wai; Germany proclaimed to the world that she
regarded her solemn treaty a a scrap of paper. The German sailors
have just given a dramatic demonstration that German ideals have not
changed. The German word remains a scrap of paper.
The sinking of the ships Saturday is characteristic. It was a piece
of grossest treachery and bad faith. The surrender of the fleet in good
condition was part of the terms which Germany accepted. The sinking
of the ships after the pledge under which they were surrendered is the
plainest evidence of the confidence that can be put in German promises,
The incident is not unique. Wherever it has been possible by trick
ery or evasion to .make ineffective any provision of the armistice, that
course has been unhesitatingly followed by the German government or
military authorities. On the day the ships were sunk Marshal Foch
was compelled to issue a sharp order to the enemy respecting unau
thorized movements of German troops in the direction of Esthonia, and
to demand the immediate evacuation of all territory which before the
war was part of Russia.
A writer in the National Review who accompanied the Allied com
mission to German ports to receive the surrender of U-boats relates of
how three of these vessels were discovered at Wilhelmshaven, and how
the German Admiral Goette attempted to prove by German logic that
these boats were exempt from seizure. "We agreed to deliver all U-boats
in condition to proceed to tea in the first fourteen days of the armistice,"
he said. "But, although we do not deny that the three boats in question
should have been delivered in that period, the fact that they were not so
delivered releases us from the obligation to deliver them now." This is
an illuminating example of the reasoning of the Germans applied
throughout the disarmament proceediags under the armistice to justify
their evasions and general bad faith. They (sought by every means to
hold back railroad rolling stock, airplanes, guns and equipment, or to
substitute worthless material. They pretended to have carried out pro
visions as to dispositions of troops which they did not carry out, and
made representations as to the food situation which investigatioa proved
to be untrue.
With this knowledge of enemy proclivity lor deception and bad faith
the Allies will be compelled to impose heavy bonds for the performance
of every clause of the treaty. The Germans signature to that document
will mean only what Allied insistence, watchfulness and, if necessary,
force, make it mean.
SINS OF THE MOUTH
liy the Rev. Charles Stelzlc
When a man eats with his knife if isn't a sign mat "ne is not reli
gious it means that he has not yet made full use of his religion.
For religion makes a man well-rounded, perfecting him in every de
tail of life.
Eating with one's knife isn't an unpardonable win It just shows
a lack of culture w hich should be one of .the results of religion.
It is not required of a man that ho become familiar with all the rules
of "etiquette," many of which are absurd. But the rules of conduct that
should govern him may easily be learned by considering the comfort
both mental and phyical of his family and his friends with whom he
lives. .
For a man, even thoughtlessly, to regularly go through a juggler'a
act of drivhig a knifu down his throat or seeming to cVery time he
eats, isn't conductive to comfort to those who are compelled to look on.
If he really enjoys this exercise, it were butter to indulge in it in
private especially as the public doesn't appreciate this kind of a show.
Almost as visciou is thu habit of thrusting a linger into one's
wide-open mouth because there isn't a toothpick handy. And of course
a toothpick should bo used only in private.
Nearly as bad is tho practice of sucking food out of one's teeth, to
tho tune of a chirping squirrel.
Now all this has a lot to do with religion. And any man who i3
careless about those matters cannot hope to impress his neighbors with
the cultural influences of what is actually tho greatest force for refine
ment in all tho world.
; Professor do Valera. "president of tho Irish Republic," is in Amcr
iea.'It ls announced. ; Somebody ought to advise him that the custom of
presidents establishing' their residence abroad ia of recent origin and
really isn't binding at all. .
The success of a strike is often measured by the aniouut of incon
venience it causes the public.
Part of our interest in Europe ia
loaned it.

"Yes, Mawruss." Abe Potash said,
"there is some of our people which
seemingly has got the fdee that if
they show any sympathy for them

"And yet, Abe, there ain't one or

owe it to the fact that some time or
another in Russia or in Spain or even
way back in Mitsroyim Hooretz, his

to account for them now, Mawruss,
and when the American Jewish lie

they want to raise thirty-five million
dollars for our starving brothers in
Europe, they ain't asking us for our
money, Mawruso. This money don't
belong to us. We are only taking
care of it until the time comes when
other Jews needs it to keep them

our forefathers to keep themselves

RUSSIAN MORALE STIFFENED, CAN NOW
GO IT ALONE AGAINST THE BOLSHI
ARCHANGEL. May SO. (Corres
pondence of the Associated Press.
Six months ago Archangel was a
gay. wartime capital, with hundreds
of Russian soldiers in its streets and
very few- of them at the front. To
day it is becoming isober, businesslike-and
engaged in only one pursuit
fighting the Bolsheviki.
The change came about in the win
ter. Last Autumn the Russian mili
tary forces were small and the civil
ian and promenade-the-streets. officers
class made merry while Americans
and the British and French fought
their battles at the front. But all
the time, the people were being mob
ilized and trained. There was doubt
in nearly every mind about the abil
ity of the newly trained Russians to
fight. Late in the winter, when the
Bolsheviki offensive was at its height,
Russian mobilized troops were thrown
into the line. They made good, and,
from that moment, with only a few
little setbacks now and then, the Rus
sians have been keeping up the pace.
Russians Develop Morale
For six months they relied upon
strangers to fight for them, but from
the moment they began to find them
selves, the Russians developed a mor
ale that has brought about countless
chauges not only at the front but be
hind the lines, in one easy-going Arch
angel. Pushing them on has been a little
pocket-edition general, ,a dynamic
personality in a plump five-foot frame
Vladimir Marushcvsky, commander-in-chief
of the Rtsian troops of the
North. Once in command of the Rus
sian troops in France, he came to
mous Wichita game preserve of Okla
homa. Two men have- been commissioned
by thei game- warden to round up the
required number tf antelope on the
plains in the northern part of the state
and if they succeed the animals will
be tdiippcd and the buffalo returned
under the care of an experienced care
taker, in tinio to allow of their being
placed on exhihitionlurjng fair week.
Prochaska has started on the work
of collecting live animals for his ex

most interesting of the fair. The Hist

Compulsory Weekly Bath
General MaruHhevsky, garbed ii
plain, simple uniform without tin
gaudy coloring or fancy swords af
fected by some of his subordinates,
wont among the soldiers and talked
to them frequently. So ho ordered
a compulsory weekly bath for every
ma i in the army.
"It is impossible, thero are not
enough bath houses in Archangel."
complained some of his company and
battalion commanders, "i am m)t in
terested in how you bathe them."
faid another order from the dynamic
little general. ' That is up to you. I
will bear no excuse; t-very soldier
must have his weekly bath."
And now, nearly every day vna
may st-o in Archangel, u company or
so of Kinging soldiers, marching to
a balh house with their bundle's of
clean linen under their arms. Tim
atmosphere of Archangel has certain
ly improved.
Mobilize Every Abie-Bodied Man
Practically every able-bodied Rus
sia.i in Archangel and the province,
botwt-cn 18 and 43, has been mobil
ized, and thoso Ix'neath and above
the liniiti-v, the schoolings and the
middle-aged men, have joined volun
tarily the civic guard and. militia.
In the parks, on the streets and in
tho backyards one may see little
groups of high school boys or ltoardod
men, mastering military evolutions
and the technique of an army rifle,
under jiisliut tion of army officers or
non-coms.

WEEKLY BANK CLEARINGS
NEW YORK, June 28. The actual
condition of clearing house banks and
trust companies for the week shows
that they hold $64,077,130 reserve in
excess of legal requirements. This is
an increase of $33,668,600 from last
week.
THE COTTON MARKET
NEW YORK, June 28. Cotton clos
ed steady at a net decline of 32 to 45
points.
THE GRAIN MARKETS
CHICAGO, June 28. Corn traders
busied themselves today liquidating
holding in the July delivery and gave
only passing notice to the signing of
the peace treaty After ruling weak
most of the time, the market closed
unsettled, c net lower to c ad
vance, with September $1.75 to
$1.7594' and December $1.55 to
$1.53?i. Oats lost a shade to 14c.
In provisions the outcome varied
from 5c decline to an equal gain.
Virtual indifference with which the
signing of the treaty was regarded
as a price-making factor merely dem
onstrated that the news of the sign
ing had been discounted in full, long
before hand, as gar as the event could
affect the value or corn. On the other
hand, the necessity of liquidating July
holdings was an urgent matter for
unlicensed dealers. Besides, the mar
ket was weighed down by the fact that
considerable grain was arriving out of
condition. Toward the 'last, however,
rallies took place as a result of cov
ering by shorts who desired freedom
from risks over Sunday.
Improved crop reports tended to
weaken the oats market. Dealings,
though, were listless.
Provisions held about steady. High
er quotations helped to sustain values,
and so, " too, did assertions that ex
port business wouia be enlarged.
STOCKS AND BONDS
NEW YORK, June 28. Wall Street
received with characteritic calm the
news of the signing of the peace
treaty. Some stocks which were
strong at the outset extended their
gains, while others reacted moderately
on the customary week-end profit
taking.
The air of quiet optimism was some
what tempered by rumors indicating a
revival of disturbing conditions In
Mexico as affecting foreign oil con
cessions, but reversals in the petrol
eums were comparatively moderate.
Motors and their subsidiaries, espe
cially the rubber division, displayed
more strength than any other group,
although tobaccos, leathers and paper
and food shares were decidedly strong
and active.
American Woolen was another
prominent feature, extending yester
day's substantial advance, but yielding

the better part of its gain. Coppers
and shippings also were inclined to
improve, but rails snowed further neg
lect, their drift in the main being
slightly downward. Sales amounted
to 600,000 shares.
The bank statement disclosed an
other slight contraction of actual
loans and another moderte increase of
excess reserves, the total for that
item now aggregating 864,000,000
against an actual deficit two weeks
ago.
Dealing in bonds were light and fea
tureless, with trifling changes in Lib
erty issues and internationals. Total
sales, par value, $4,200,000. Old United
States registered fours were 4 per
cent higher on call for the week.
WEEKLY REVIEW
NEW YORK, June 28. Events of
the week cp the stock exchange em
phasized with greater force the para
mount influence of the money market
and the economic changes, which are
expected to follow the ratification of
the peace treaty.
Call loans repeated their recent 15
per cent maximum, but speedily went
back to 5 per cent when it became
evident that much of the midyear's
large disbursements for interest and
dividends were well in hand.
Bankers discouraged the, idea of an
indefinite continuance of easy money,
pointing out that the moving of bum
per crops and demands of general bus
iness were bound to Impose heavy
burdens on capital for the balance xt
the year.
Progressive industrial improvement
is noted in the diminuition of labor
difficulties, increased production and
maintenance of prices. Export con
ditions in the steel and iron trade are
especially encouraging, sales for May
having been the largest since Decem
ber. 1917.
Figures dealing with the country's
record breaking foreign trade balance
for the fiscal year will not be obtain
able for another fortnight, but present
conditions point to an enormous in
crease over the May returns, which
showed an excess over imports of $3 -505,000,000.

ON RICHES OF INDIA
CALCUTTA.June 28. Great Britain
is waking up as to the industrial pos
sibilities of Indian. A commission
headed by Sir Thomas Holland has
made a report recommending drastic
measures to prevent foreign enterprise
benefiting from India's unexploited
riches. Modern methods of agricul
ture, labor saving machinery in indus
try, industrial education of native, bet
ter evploitation of forests and fisher
ies and a survey of coal possibilities
are among the proposals.

THE YANKS AS TOMMY SAW 'EM
Oh, the English and the Irish, and the
'owlin' Scotties, too,
The Canucks and Austryleuns and the
'airy French Pollu.
The only thing that bothered us a
year before we knew.
Was 'ow in 'ell tne Yanks 'ud look,
and wot in 'ell they'd do.
They 'adn't 'ad no trynein', they
didn't know the gyme.
They 'adn't never marched it much
their shoot'ng was the syme
An' the only thing that bothered us
that day in lawst July
Was 'ow in 'ell the line'd 'old if they
should run aw'y.
Them leggy, nosey, new 'uns, just
come across the sea.
We couldn't-'elp but wonder 'ow in
'ell their guts 'ud be.
An' the only thing that bothered us,
in all our staggerin' ranks,
Was vot in 'ell 'ud 'appen w'en the
'Uns 'ad 'it the Yanks.
My word; it appened sudden, w'en
the drive 'ad first begun;
We seed the Yanks a runnin' Caw1
blimy; 'ow the run.
But the only thing that bothered jia
that seed the chase begin.
Was 'ow in 'ell to stop 'em 'fore they
got into Berlin.
They didn't 'ave no tactics but the
blocdy manual.
They 'ain't learned no orders but
" 'Oooray" and "Give 'em 'ell."
But the only thing that bothered us
about them leggy lads
Was ow in 'ell to get the chow to
feed their "Kamerads."
So we're standin' all together in a
stiffish firin' line,
If anyone should awsk you, you can
say we're doin' fine.
But the only thing that bothers us,
an' that don't bother much.
Is 'ow in 'ell to get the dirt to bury
all the Dutch.
Gaw's truth; it's rotten fightiu' that
all our troops 'as seen.
The 'Un's a dirty pl'yer, becoz 'c3
alwus been.'
But the only thing that bothers us in
'andlin' him our thanks.
Is 'ow in 'ell we'd done if it weren't
for the Yanks.
Oh, the English and the-Irish, and the
'owlin' Scotties. too.
The Canucks and Austryleuns, an'
the 'airy French Pollu.
The only thing that bothered us don't
bother us no mon
ies whv in 'ell we didn't know the
Yank& boys before.

The following letter by Walter
Douglas is from the current Issue of
the Arizona Mining Journal:
PHELPS DODGE CORPORATION
Office of Assistant to the President
Douglas, Arizona
Mr. Robert A. Watkins.
Arizona Mining Journal,
Phtienix. Arrzona.
Pear Mr. Watkins:
I have received your letter of April
3rd and I am glad to comply with
your request to furnish you a brief
article on the copper situation at the
present time as I see it.
The Copper Situation
Since the beginning of the Croat
War in August oj 1914, the copper
indjstry has parsed through extraor
dinary periods of depressions and
prosperity, curtailed production and
record outputs. On the declaration of
hostilities the price of the metal,
while below the. a vera"" of the pre
vious year, permitted 01 a small prof
it under the then existing production
cost;?, bat with the elimination of the
demand from the- Central Powers, the
price rapidly rell to n cents per
pound, forcing the suspension of
many mines and the curtailment of
operations of those which continued
to produce. It .was not then realised
what extraordinary, demands modern
warfare would make on commodities
for the manufacture of munitions. The
year 1915 opened with copper at 12
3-4 cents and then end of the same
year recorded 22 1-3 cents. From that
time and until September, 1917, the
Price Fixing Committee of the War
Industries Board assumed, with the
consent of the producers, the power
to determine the maximum price at
which the metal could be sold the
price reached the high figure of 33
1-4 cents. Whatever may be the opin
ion of economists as to the wisdom
of ignoring the natural law of supply
and demand by the fixation of an ar
bitrary price for a raw material, it
must be recognized that an abnormal
condition existed and not only were
the consumers in this case the allied
government, suffering through the
high and violently fluctuating prices,
but the producers were likewise great
ly embarrassed as their producing
costs were to a great extent based on
the quotation existing in the previous
month. Exemplifying this uncertain
ty, the prices obtained for the metal
varied In '1915 from 12 3-4 cents to 22
1-3 centsj in 1916 from 22 1-2 cents to
33; 1-4 cents and in 1917 from 23 1-2
cents to 33 cents. During the period
under consideration the United States
production increased from 525,529 me
tric tons in, 1914 to 872,065 tons in
1917. It is obvious that nothing can
be more' detrimental to a great indus
try; .both from the point of view of
thei stockholder and the employee,
than violent fluctuations in price and
output, necessitating, as they do, pe
riods of great prosperity and high
wages and correspondingly bitter de
pression and unemployment. The
copper industry has been peculiarly
susceptible to these fluctuations in
the past, and we are today experienc
ing one of the alarming extremes.
Up to the actual date of the signing
of the armistice our government con
tinued to urge on the mining com
panies that every effort be put forth
to maintain and if posrible increase
their output. Consequently, when the
war ended, the producers found them
selves with hundreds of millions of
pounds of copper in transit and in
refineries which had been produced
at a maximum cost and for which
there was no sale-t any price. Since
the first of the year perhaps a couple
of, hundred million pounds have been
sold to domestic consumers at prices
as low as 14 1-2 cent3, representing
a heavy loss, it being estimated that
the copper stock on hand on January
1st had actually cost 18 cents to pro
duce.' .
' There has as yet been no copper
exported to Europe, which boforo the
war required from 40 to 60 per cent
of our output, as the governments- of
England. France and Italy have large
stocks on hand and will probaly not
be in the market until autumn. As
soon as the Peace Treaty is signed,
Germany and Austria Hungary, who
are absolutely denuded of the red
metal, will be heavy buyers, provided
their labor difficulties are satisfacto
rily adjusted. Were I a pessimist on
the future of copper, I should feel
that there was no Justification in con
tinuing the operatlon,of several of our
high cat properties which are today
losing money on every pound of cop
per which they produce. Not only,
however, do I believe that after the
next few months we will see a mate
rially better demand when readjust
ment from war to peaco conditions
has been accomplished, but with many
others in the same position as I, feel
that, where financially possible, op
erations should be continued in order
tQ prevent distress in the mining
communities and to provide employ
ment to those of our former employ
ees who are now returning after hav
ing made the supreme offer of their
Production Stopped, Men Are
At Once Put To Work
On Development
TYRONE, N. M., June 28. The
stopping of all production of copper
at the Burro Mountain branch of the
Phelp3 Dode Corporation at Tyrone,
and the turning of attention to devel
opment work and repairs indicates
plainly the policy of the company. Ty
rone cannot produce copper at the
present market price, with the pres
ent cost of labor and supplies; more
over, there is no incentive to produce
copper now when the copper can not
be sold, and overburden the market
with the unsold product.
The shutting down of the Tyrone
plaift has little effect on the employ
ment situation in that camp, however,
a3 practically all of the force of min
ers have been producing ore for the
mill have been' olaced on development
work, which will be pushed to the ut
most, and the company proposes- to
maintain its policy of placing in em
ployment all returned soldiers' who
left there for the v.-orld war.
At the present time testing is being
done in the big mill which will prob
ably result in the remodelling of the
mill for more efficient service wfien
it is ready to start again. The shut
ting down of Tyrone at this time is
the first step towards making it a
more permanent and substantial camp
when the copper market conditions
warrant.
In the meantime, the mine force is
being retained on development work,
even though the cost of such work is
higher now than it would be at a
later date.
lives for all that we hold mo3t dear
in life. . '
Admitting that during the past four
years 80 per cent of the world's cop
per has been devoted to the manufac
ture of munitions' but a fraction of
which will be salvaged, there 'exists
a heavy deficit which must be sup
plied to compensate for the tonnage
which would normally have been re
quired for peace purposes. It is es
timated that telegraph, telephone and
cable companies through their inabil
ty to obtain wire for extension, re
pairs and replacements, require over
a hundred million pounds to bring
their operations to pre-war efficiency.
Extensive plans are being formulated
for the electrification of railroads and
in the case of England and France
the plans of their governments include
the installation of central generating
plants from which will be transmit
ted electricity for the operation of
government owned transportation sys
tems and for power and lighting of
important municipalities and" indus
trial centers. A it isx a fact that pe
riods of great prosperity have Invari
ably followed great wars, it would
seem that, with the problems of re
adjustment solved, we who produce
nearly 70 per cent of the world's to
tal output of copper may reasonably
expect our share of such prosperity.
Copper will never again be sold at the
low prices which have obtained in
the past. Wages, due to the greatly
increased cost of living, have in
creased; with depth the copper con
tent of the ore has fallen and he ore
itself has become more expensive to
beneficate. Costs of production have
consequently mounted rapidly and ifc
is unreasonable and contrary to the
accepted principle of conservation
that a wasting industry should be ex
hausted without a fair return to . la
bor in good wages and to stockhold
ers in reasonable dividends.
To Summarize: Until the present
menace of, the huge stocks of copper
on hand in the United States and
Europe is removed through their ab
corbtion by the consuming industries,
we must expect some months of re
duced output and intensive economics
in all directions, but the future is
bright with possibilities and discour
agement and pessimism are without
Justification.
Yours very truly,
WALTER DOUCLAS.

ARIZONA PROSPECTORS'
ARE SPURRED ON BY
BIG 'ASBESTOS' DEMAND
Rich Values At I MINE MEN OF UTAH
Sleeping Beauty
5 According to information received
by Mr. G. R. Fansett, mining engineer
of the Arizona Bureau of Miucs of
the University of Arizona, the demand
for asbestos far exceeds the amount
produced in the United States. Judg
ing from samples which have been
received by the Bureau of Mines from
properties located in Arizona, much of
the local product is high grade long
staple. The price paid for this claos
'or asbestos by the manufacturers
runs as high as $2,000 per ton. Inci
dentally, the duties imposed on the
forc-isn product more than offset any
addition high freight rates that the
Arizona producer may have to p:y
ou his product. Due to the high price
offered, ths fact that the long staple
is in a 'Class by Itself, and for that
.reason practically has not competi
tion from the product of other coun
I tries, as well as Arizona offering a
"virgin field for the prospecting of as
bestos deposits, it is safe to say that
the search for and the, Development of
asbectos properties will offer won
.derful possibilities to the prospectors
of this state.
GOVERNMENT WILL
SELL TUNGSTEN ORE
TUCSON, June 5 Eight hundred
pounds of tungsten, said to be 90 per
cent, will be, sold to the highest bid
der by Deputy Marshal Treahy on
July 21, under order of the federal
court.
The tungsten was brought into the
United States from below the line by
Joso Reynaldo and C. P. Osgood. Once
across the line, Reynaldo brought the
goods to Tucson and tried to soil tho
stuff to Tellegrin & Son. He might
have ucceedcd had not Osgood ap
peared anil claimed the tungsten,
charging Reynaldo with theft, in the
justice court. The federal authorities
then entered in to the case and Rey
naldo and Osgood were arrested and
convicted of smuggling the concen
trates into the United States.
One alleged owner "of the stuff ap
peared to claim the property but de
cided it would take too much money
and time to properly identify the
goods and allowed the government to
declared the goods forfeited. Then
the government decided to sell the
tungsten.
Tungsten at the last quotation was
about $7.00 per unit of twenty pounds
for 60 per cent concentrate's.

The diamond drill now being ope
rated on the Louis de Orr claim of the
Inspiration-Miami Copper company
penetrated a body of rich bornite and
chalcopyrite at a depth of 300 feet,
according to Patt Sullivan, a promi
nent operator from that district. Mr.
Sullivan says the prospectors are ac
tive and everything is running
smooth. This property is located in
the Sleeping Beauty district and has
been prospected with diamond drills
on several occasions. C. E. Hart, gen
eral manager, is well satisfied with
the results so far attained.
Mr. Sullivan also reports that John
Christy, a prominent mining man of
Clifton, who was in the district lat
week, is returning to Clifton to meet
a party of New York mining men who
are enroute to this district to inspect
the Inspiration-Miami Copper compa

TOLEDO, June 28. Surging
crowd of autolsts, women and plain
boxing "fans" packed the training
camps of Jess Willard. and Jack
Dempsey today and fought for advan
tageous points for observation to see
the heavyweight rivals go through
their paces in preparation for their
championrhip contests next Friday.
The crowds were the largest that
have visited either camp.
Dempsey boxed three fast rounds
with Jock Malone and Sergeant Bill
Tate, while Willard traveled only six
rounds intsead. of the usual eight.
The champion bcxed three rounds
with Jack Hempel and three with
Walter Monahan.
The Jamaica Kid, of Dempsey's
sparring staff, refused to box with
the challenger ' because he said his
jaw and stomach, were Bore from the
punishment of previous days.
iTate, it was (claimed, declined to
get into the ring until assured that
Dempsey would ox easily.
The , rchampien displayed more
speed and snapMn his workout than
he has in a week, and his showing
drew praise from Tommy Ryan of
middleweight ' championship fame,
who declared, after his workout, that
Willard was in condition to defend
his title, which " some o fhis critics
doubt.
