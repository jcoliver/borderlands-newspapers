WASHINGTON. Feb. 17. Coinci
dent with the reopening of the Ameri
can embassy in Mexico the big army
of national guardsmen that was con
centrated on the border on account of
bandit activities will be in process of
dissolution. Orders were issued by
the war department today directing
General Funston to begin the immed
iate demobilization of all the guard
units remaining In border camps, and
it is expected that the last troop train
will be on its way north by March 7.

General Funston still will have on
the border nearly 50.000 troops, all of
the regular army, disposed along the

SAILED FOR JAPAN MAYBE
By Review Leased Wire)
EL PASO, Feb. 17. Francisco Villa,
whose movements have been a mystery
to his enemies as well as to the mass
of his followers, has made his way
to the west coast and embarked for
Japan, according to W. L. Crawford,
a well kn'own cattleman of Dallas and
a former Texas ranger, who says his
source of information is one of Villa's
most trusted agents and a man per
sonally known to him to be reliable.
Villa is said to have travelled to
the coast in disguise and got safely
abuaid a ship in Mazatlan and now
is three weeks at sea.

PRESIDENT
.Will Ask Congress for Free
Hand to Act for Protection
of United States Before the
House and Senate Adjourn.
(By Review Leased Wire)
WASHINGTON, Feb. 17. The
advisability . of going before con
gress before the end of the pres
ent session, March 4, to- make
cer.ain that he be clothed with
sufficient power to protect Amer
ican lives and property from Ger
man submarine activities was
discussed by President Wilson to
day with members of the senate
whom he called into conference
during a brief visit to the Capitol.
Afterward it was indicated that
the President had not mads up
his mind on the question, but haj
such a step under consideration
because of a possibility after ad
journment some emergency might
arise necessitating action before
congress could be called together
again.
To Ask "Free Hand"
The suggestion was made that con
gress be asked to pass a broad resolu
tion authorizing the President to take
any action for the protection of Am
erican rights and avoiding siec!fie
stipulations as to how the protection
should be aftorded. It was indicated
that Mr. Wilson remained as anxious
as ever to avoid war and that he gave
no suggestion that a declaration of
war which congress alone can m.-;ke.
is een considered by hiia at present
in connection with the possibility of
a request for additional authority.
War Still Expected

that Germany's submarine campaign

forecast by the President in his ad

Piesiilent is understood to feel how
ever, that when the time comes the
solution outlined In that address
should be followed out literally, and
the steps taken should constitute an
extmsion of further protection to Am
J erican interests rather than a declar-
ation of war.
Consuls are Safe
Officials were nuch gratified at a
message from Itcrne today saying the
American consuls remaining in Ger
many, for whom some concern had
been felt, would depart early next
week, but there was no evidence that
the development would lessen to an
appreciable decree the tension be

pointed out that the overshadow ius
issue is the German submarine cam

must be considered as of ninor Im

There also was much gratification

The Importance of Meat Inspection
By DR. It. F. KRENEK
U. S. Department of ARnailiuie
Mont animals are suhjeet to disease
which impair or destroy the whole
someness of their meat as human food,
but tile presence or efforts of disease
are not always discernible in the
dressed carcass. A piece of meat may
carry the serins of a dangerous disease
without giving any indication .f ti,is
fact to the consumer. To detect di
sease there should he an expert in
spection at the time of slaughter. To
protect the consumer at a point where
he is nmible to protect himself is. gen
erally speaking, the object of meat
inspection.
The first Federal Meat Inspection
was established in this country in
August, 1S90, by the passage ol a law
"pi'.ividing for an inspection of meats
for exportation". Primarily, therefore,
meat inspection was begun In the
I'nited States not because Const-ess
had in view the protection of the peo
' pie of this country from eating d'-
seas'd meats, but because foreign gov-

he is afraid of losing his job. And
; rightfully so. It may be that the de
I fendatit in the case has considerable
! political itifltience and would cause
i the inspei-rtir who Is trying to do his
- x 'duty to be removed from ollice. This
asea I
j is a very common case.
' Every man. woman and child should
take a vUal interest in this problem.
They should take mure interest in
their inspector's work whose duty is

funds were 'appropriated For the ereo th.lt nand9 are ffow, from ,,.
tioti or a small municipal aDauoiri
having iimple "cooler rooms" for the
keeping of meat in connection with
it. All the butchers in the city were
compelled to bring their stock to this
abattoir lor slaughter. The slaughter
ing is done by Muellers hired by tho
city and under the direct supervision
of u graduated veterinarian who is
paid a salary. Tiie inspector governs
himself in the disposition of diseased
carcasses according to the regulations
governing the I'nited States meat in
spection. He sees to it that the plant
is sanitary and that the meat is kept
and handled in a cleanly way. T.ho
meat is kept in the coolers at the
ernments were opposed to allowing , abattoir and taken out by the different
butchers according fo their needs.
Furthermore, the inspector is required
to make daily visits to the meat mar-
American meats ttj enter their ports
for the alleged reason that the people
of those countries would suffer therefrom.
About this time considerable agita
tion was going on in this country on J vested with authority to inspect
kets in the city and observe and regu
late the conditions there. He also- is
all
the part of the press and individual
writers, the object of which was to
expose the highly unsanitary condi
tions of the packing houses and the
danger of eating meat that wasn't in
spected. The result of ?M was the
passage of a law by Congress in 1S91
which provided for the inspection of
all meat animals slaughtered in the
United States for use in interstate
commerce as well as international
commene. Thereafter, year after
year, the inspection was strengthened
and bettered, and on June 30, 1906.
when the '-Pure Food and Drug Law"
went int'j effect, our present form of
meat inspection was inaugurated, and
at the present time Uie Federal meat
inspection of the I'nited States stands
second to none.
But this Federal Meat Inspection
applies only to those packing plants
that engage in interstate or interna
tional traffic. Butchers who do strict
ly state business without shipping or
selling their product into other states
are exempt. And very few states
maintain an inspection 'of their own.
So a butcher doing only a local busi
ness is free to kill a diseased animal
and sell the meat to the public. In
such cases the public has absolutely
no protection. Supposing, such a
butcher bought a steer for a hundred
dollars and upon slaughter found that
this animal was very sick with pneu
monia, or tuberculosis, or some other
disease, and 99 chances out of the
hundred he would shrink from the
idea of losing the value ol this steer
and would sell it to the unsuspec ting
public over the block. The only way
for the public to protect itself from
such unscrupulous dealers is !j main
tain an inspection which has nothing
in common wi'ii the butcher and the
sole interest o: wic'j is to protect the

meats shipped into the city from out
.-ide sources and to condemn any that
may have become sjAiiied or contamin
ated in transportation, which is very
frequently the case. Thus, all the
fish und oysters and even '"canned
goods" are inspected before they are
offered for sale to the consumer.
Nor, do the dairymen who sell milk
and butter to the people of Paris,
Texas, escape the inspection. The
same veterinary inspector makes fre
quent and unannounced visits to these
dairies and sees that the prescribed
sanitary measures are observed. He
tests all the cows for tuberculosis,
which is of the greatest importance,
and attends to ihe health of the herds
generally. He sees that the milk is
handled in a sahitary manner and all
possible sources of contamination are
eliminated. He takes samples of milk
from the dairymen's wagons on the
streets to see if the milk has been
"watered" or otherwise adulterated.
With the same object in view he
visits all the ice cream parlors where
he takes samples of ice cream for his
tests and analyses. Any violations or
infractions of the prescribed sanitary
measures he reports to the proper au
thorities for prosecution.
AH the expense connected with the
operation of the municipal abattoir
and the inspection is defrayed in the
following manner: The abattoir charg
es the nominal fee of 1.25 per head
for the slaughter of cattle and seventy-five
cents per head for calves,
sheep and swine. This, together witl
the "fines" collected by the prosecM
t.On of those who in some way, or
other, violate the city "pure foo:!
ordinance" pays for the protection
that the consumer has by virtue of
the inspection. The city of Paris.
Texas, after paying all the exnenses
connected with this work at ti e --d
of the first, year, had a neat little
balance on hand and everyone was
entirely satisfied.

"political shackles" which keep him
from doing his duty. Clothe him with
all the necessary authority so he may
be able to do bis work without fear
of losing his position. Then, and only
then, will the inspection be a success.

The demand for tickets fer the
of a Bisbee boy, born in this city and j jubilee so far is away ahead of ex
have some form of inspection but in
; the greatest majority of cases this
falls very short of its object, because
the inspectors are not armed with the
i proper authority. Their scope of work
! is limited in most instances tv the
inspection of the milk, etc., after de
; livery to the city and the market.
' They have no authority to go out and
inspect the sources from which the
! city obtains its supply of meat and
I milk and butter. They are not "backed
'up by an ordinance which would give
. them the authority to gV to the dairy
' and see how the cows are stabled,
how they are fed and in what gen
eral condition the dairy Is. If there
are diseased cows in a dairy they have
no authority to condemn these, or
have them removed from the healthy
ones. The milk inspector may find
the bacillus of tuberculosis in samples
of milk which he has obtained from
the milk wagon on the street, but he
has no authority to go to the dairy
from which it came and test the herd
in Order to determine the source of
the infection.

A wedding as surprising as it was
charming was that last night at the
home of Mr. and Mrs. C. S. Wilson, in
Quarry Canyon, when Miss Cora Ellen
,Sprau and Mr. E. Ellsworth Xeyland
were united in marriage at 8:15-by
Reverend John F. Fry. The event was
one oi the most perfectly kept secrets,
and It was not until ' the bride and
bridegroom were safely aboard the
train at Osborn enroute to the Coast,
that the few friends who knew it, told
anything or anybody.
The home was tastefully decorated
in smilax and Bride's roses, while big
crimson hearts swung at random vari
ously over the party's heads. The ring
ceremony was under a canopy . of
hearts and fiOwers, only the pastor,
Mr. and Mrs. Wilson and the bride's
friend. Miss F.oyd, witnessing the
event
A wedding dinner had preceded the
ceremony and the bride and bride
groom after accepting congratulations,
sped away with Mr. and Mrs. Wilson
to Osborn, where the Golden State
limited was to carry the two to South
ern California. Thus far this secret
had been sacredly kept, but as the
train became later and later, friends
from Ilisbee began calling up at the
neighboring station until the whole
Warren District, it seemed, knew Of
the surprising event.
The bride is one of the most popular
young women of Bisbee's social set.
She has made her home here for the
.past eight years, and until recent
months held the position of bookkeep
! er at the Bisbee office of the Moun-
tain States Telephone and Telegraph
! company, coming here from Sandusky,
I Ohio.
I The bridegroom is manager of the
! grocery department of tne Phelps
I Dodge store in Bisbee. and came here
several years ago from Cleveland,
i Ohio.
Mr. and Mrs. Neyland will be at
'the Coast perhaps two weeks, when
i they will return here, making their
I nome at the Crocker Apartment in
i Warren.

'MOVIES , PLAYS AND SIN.
There is an evangelist in Phoenix. He appears to be
very successful, judging from the standards as set by 'he
Hon. William Sunday, of baseball and pulpit fame. In
fact Mr.i Hart's (for that is the name of the Phoenix per
former), audiences appear to be growing by leaps and
bounds. He has taken into question nearly evearything on
the calendar; dancing, smoking, walking, spooning, and
now he rises, in his wrath and swats the 'movie' and
theatricals.
He asserted that nine-tenths of the plays hinge on mur
der, suicide and violation of flie seventh commandment,
or crime of some kind or another. He alleged that they
are the educators of sin and he read a number of scrip
tural passages showing what the effect of sin is, quoting,
at odd times: "Sin burns like fire"; "Sin, when it is fin
ished, brings forth death". He couples with this last
quotation, the question, "If sin brings forth death, should
I wink at it"?
Plots of the world"s greatest stories, cf the greatestl
poems, of the greatest music, in fact of all art of what
evej kind or nature it may be, have been taken from
either the race's virtues or its failings. It is an un
fortunate fact that the most interesting stories have beenr
buili, not upon the world's virtues, but upon its failures.
Each great story, through its portrayal has made for a
moral and consequently its effect is good. Even the risqug
plots and stories of the great French writers, sometimes
tabooed in the United States. have their morals or por
tray a virtue of the race. It is sometimes necessary to
paint a moral by extremes, i
When fie evangelist takes it upon himself to act as a
one-man censorship, based upon certain passages from
the Bible, it might be timely to add that every criticised
failing of the age can secure, if it searches far enough
in the holy volume, some passage which will, apparently,
uphold that failure. Unfortunately the Bible was writ
ten for the edification of a different age from this. Its
laws and its rulings, if they should be applied at the
present time, would precipitate revolution.
Censorship of motion pictures is like the censorship of
fiction, of music, of poetry. No two authorities on any
classification of art can agree. That is the trait which
makes life worth living, which makes it agreeable for all
cf us to get along in the world a difference of opinion.
If the English censors could have prevailed in the first
part of the nineteenth century. Lord Byron's poetical
works would have been buried under the Thames. Cer
vantes' famous novel, "Don Quixote" would have slum
bered deep in the Atlantic if the early dsiy Puritans of
America had had their way in the matter. Wild, bar
baric music, artistic thought it may be in every way, ac
cording to many critics, should be ruled out of the mar
kets and art, of the brush ami oil, has come in for too
n-any criticisms to elaborte further.
Thus the theatre has come in for its cudgeling at the
hands of excited prudes. Yet the theatre is one of the
national institutions of the United States and has pro
duced great artists who have received, and very justly
so, the plaudits of this and other nations. Yet the
theatre prospered and has come down to us in a very
wholesome condition. It has produced great plays, chi
cles which are wonderful sermons but which are so well
buried in interesting, human material, as to invite the
casual man to hear and listen.
Would "Hamlet", "Julius f'easar", "Othello" and "Mac
beth", and many other of the world's greatest plays, have
been written and preserved to us, at the present time,
nad,ifot the great English playwright taken his plots from
the sins of humanity? And is it the conscsus of opin
ion that these plays carry humanity into immorality?
And would "Septtiuber Morn" have lieeoine an inter
i
nationally-known canvas Jiud not hoiuc of the pruli.,h
people of Chicago taken exception to its nudity?
This is an era of motion and it lias been transferred
into our amusements through the medium of the screi ;i
the motion piiture theatres. Their product has be-!
conic rrt. The people desire to be entertained and no
method, ever seen before, has been evolved whereby
everyone, no matter how high or how low their station
(nay lie; can see 1'ie master-pieces of Tact and fiction a ;
they can now in the 'unifies. The most interesting plots
are seized upon and Iniilt into entertainments. Some,
no doubt, have unpleasant moral.:. Some few are im
moral. These, happily, arc being driven from the n ree:i
lv ' .3 n;..l inn iiii-lim urtnlmiT. l.,.n, ,.t. . Tl,, f.
pie realize that the people desire amusement, but desire
wholesome amusement and they, better than any one
else, may be trusted with such a wholesale reformation
as the Phoenix evangelist suggests. Tiie Phoenix man's
ideas, when put intd effect, -would not be reformation,
they would be annihilated.
In his denunciation of the 'movie' he stated that an ex
hibitor in a Pennsylvania community, where he conducted
a series of revivals, had offered him $500 to get out of
the town, saying that he was losing business for his
theatre.
Thanks to the intelligence of the people of this state
they do not need the advice of Evangelist Hart on what
they should see in the theatre, be it the legitimate or
the 'movie'. The people here, and we believe, the people
there, can think for themselves.
HUNT MAKES FEWER
GAINS AS THE COUNT
- PROGRESSES TO END
AN" APOLOGY TO WHEELER.
In the following terms the Arizona Republican offers
an apology to Cochise County's sheriff: "A few days ago
in a story in the Republican of the escape in this city of
a prisoner from Tombstone it was stated that the escape
was made from Sheriff Harry Wheeler of Cochise county
and two deputies. That was an error. Sheriff Wheeler
was not in the city. The prisoners were in charge of
Deputies Rafferty and Cross. The Republican Is glad to
make this correction, for the record of Sheriff Wheeler
is an unspotted one, though a long one as sheriff of Co
chise county and as Arizona ranger long before that. He
never lost a prisoner in his career and very few fugi
tives he went after ever escaped. He is a model for all
sheriffs not only in courage and resource,' but in the con
scientiousness with which he discharges his duties."
It is good to know that other newspapers and other
counties know of the ability and the character of Mr.
Wheeler. His deputies should not be censured, under the
circumstances, as the loss of a prisoner is sometimes im
possible to prevent. It can be said th,at neither Sheriff
Wheeler nor his deputies have had much trouble with
the delivery of prisoners. The record of Mr. Wheeler and
his force has been excellent.
A SURRENDER.
The speech -of Mr. Wilkinson yesterday morning in
support Of the confirmation of the nominations transmit
ted to the senate by Governor Campbell was a plea for
good government. It was in pleasing contra.it to the
whip-cracking threats on the other side and preemptory
orders for the preservation of party regularity at the ex
pense of good government. The democratic members, at
least five of them, were, we think, convinced that the
question of party regularity was not at issue at all; that
the controversy was not between republicans and demo
crats, but between the Huntites and the anti-Huutites.
There are not nine of the former in the ente, but there
were enough of them, aided by the Western Federation
of Miners, to scare the anti-Huntites into submission.
In the preliminary voting the antis made a brave show
of independence. With the aid of the republican mem
bers they defeated the Huntites and frightened them, bi;1.
they themselves on the vital issue, the onTy one that
could count, lay down in surrender to the Western
Federation.
There is one fiing we think they have not taken in'o
account. The Western Federation has no politics, it
happens now to be as it has been throughout the regime
of former Governor Hunt, ranged on the side of demo-
cracy. It is always on the side of the party which pan
ders to it. Next we know, the republican party may be
the panderer, in which case our democratic senators will
have to bid in vain for Federation favors.
We think the auti-IIuntite senators, that is, the flva
democrats, would have done better to accepf the plan of
Mr. Winsor and the select committee than to force a vo'c
directly on the question of the confirmation. The sclet!
committee report was framed with consideration for the
sentiments of the five. It was designed to humiliate
theiu as slightly as possible; to conceal as far as possible
the fact of surrender. It contained a specious appeal fc.r
delay in the circumstances which surround the guberna
torial situation. Even an anti-Huntite could have reas
onably justified his endorsement of the report, though lie
could have justified himself to his soul.
The action of the -anti-Hunt democratic senators re
minds us of a youth who would be obstreperous, who
conceals his intention to yield to obedience by first
shrieking defiance and committing some stubborn act
before giving in.
If they had voted for the adoption of the report they
would have averted that political whip-cracking in whicn
Messrs. Winsor, Roberts and Colter indulged and whieu
was apparently effective.
We do not believe that the aiiti-lluiitites played good
politics, for the democratic party or for themselves.
There are several thousand democrats in Arizona, more
than there are Western Federation members to be reck
oned with later.
1 We do not mean that these thousands of anti-Hunt
democrats arc concerned at the fortunes of these nomi
nees of Governor Campbell or of any appointees he might
name. Nobody is greatly concerned, perhaps, but the
members themselves. But the thousands of democrats
wiio voted against the former governor and for these
anli-lliuit democratic senators -vfill resent their sur
render to the Hunt hcucliincu. Ari.uiia Republican.
Mayh c it'sjtist as well, after i'il. that TYrshiug's army
has been withdrawn from Mexico. According l the
present outlook,' it may be belter situated in a concen
tration camp at El Paso. ' It may be needed lor. something

From Appearances the Pre
cincts Giving Former Gov
ernor the Best of Argument
Were Counted First
THOENIX, Feb. 17 An appreciable
decrease was noticeable in the gains
made by Hunt in the various precincts
counted during the 'contest proceed
ings Thursday. It appears that the
Hunt forces primarily called for the
precincts in which their figures indi
cated they would jnake their largest
gains, but as the count progresses
these gains are gradually diminishing,
as was indicated by the result of the
court proceedings Thursday.
Sis precincts were counted T.hurs
day in which nine ballots were laid
aside for court ruling.
In Canille precinct, Santa Cruz
county, the court count tallied with
the official count, with one ballot laid
aside for ruling.
In Frisco precinct, Mohave county,
with two ballots hud aside for court
ruling, Hount's total is one lessand
Campbell's tallies even with the of
ficial count. The ballots referred to
as being held for ruling are both mar
ked for Hunt, but are endorsed on the
back with the word "spoiled."
In Kingman, Hunt gained two in un
disputed ballots and Campbell also
gained two. Six ballots were laid aside
or court ruling which were -markei
.rejected.
In Owen precinct, Mohave county.
Hunt gained one vote over the official
jrount, although his followers had fig
ured out a gain of two.
In Short Creek precinct, Mohave
county. Hunt gained one vote.
In Elgin precinct, Santa Cruz coun
ty, the court count tallied with the of-
Jicial count, although the Hunt fac
tion had expected to gaiu one vote.
. During 'Thursday's proceedings the
court ruled on one ballot which had
been laid aside in Upper Lowell pre
cinct. This ballot was marked with
.one diagonal line in the square follow
ing Hunt's name instead of a cross
and was counted for Hunt. This ballot
was also mutilated by having a large
hole torn near the center of it. At the
same time this ballot was counted for
Hunt by the court lie also counted a
ballot for Campbell marked with a
diagonal line. The counting of this
ballot in Upper Lowell for Hunt gavf
him a gain of one in that precinct, al
though his supporters had calculated
on gaining three.
In 47 completed precinPts Hunt's
gain to date is 122. or 25 les sthan he
had anticipated. His gain will prob
ably fall far short of this 122, as in
some of the precincts in which gains
have been made the number of ballots
counted in the court proceedings ex
ceeded the number of names of those
voting, as shown by the poll books. i

THEDA BARA DEFIES
TRADITION IN MAKING
MOST OF DAYLIGHT
Vampire Actress Believes that
Early Morning Constitu-
tional Is Better Than Sleep
ing Most of the Daytime.
According to tradition, tiie main
value of daylight to actors is for
sleeping purposes. Theda Bara defies
tradition.
The famous William Fox actress,
who wiil be seen in "The Vixen" at
the Royal this afternoon and evening,
often rises early in the morning and
takes walks along the Hudson River
to get the fresh air and sunshine
which are of so much help in her art.
"The time before most other per
sons have breakfasted," says Miss
Bara, "is the best part of the day. One
feels invigorated and refreshed by
the sweetness of the air, and there
are no jostling crowds along the
streets to interfere with one's free
dom. "Morning is the only time of the
day that I could dare to dalk in the
open. At other times I have to close
myself securely in my limousine, and
turn my back toward the crowds, or
I should be worried by people staring
into my car. I couldn't think of walk
ing at ahy other hour.
"I And that short walks , in the
morning prepare me better for my
work during the day. I can think
more clearly and infuse more spirit
" ,, . . , , ,
into my art. My advice to those' who
, . j , ,
want to rise to places of prominence
. , , , , , ,.
in the photoplay world is this:
,. , ' ' . ,
Take-plenty of morning air, and
you'll work better.'

ernment members of the Naval Con
sulting Board will, during the next
two weeks, meet with the American
Institute of Mining Ensin -ers for dis
cussion of an important phase of this
subject The meeting will be in con
nection with the 114th convention of
the Institute to be held in New York
. during: the week of February 19th and
officers of the Army and Navy, gov
ernment representatives and other ex
perts will be In attendance.
The special subject to be discussed
deals with the erosion of guns, or the
hardening of the inner surface of the'
gun tube, a problem which is at pres
ent seriously engaging th? attention
of many of the country's leading sci
entists. The discussion will be open
ed with a paper by Dr. Henry Fay, of
the Massachusetts Institute of Tech
nology, which paper was prepared
from a series of tests of metals made
Ht the Watertown arsenal, and which
is one of the technical papers at the
forthcoming convention.
A committee of the Naval Consult
ing Board, headed by Dr. Hudson
Maxim, will be present at the Mining
.Engineers session and discuss the sub
ject, after which the Committee will
hold a meeting with technical experts
in the rooms of the American Insti
tute of Mining Engineers.
The entire Naval Consulting Board
has been united lo attend the meet
ing of the institute and in view of the
great inter.--t aroused in this subject
it is believed ihat the coming meeting
will rank in importance with any in
the forty-six years of the Institute's
history. ' About five hundred mining
engineers from all parts of the coun
try will attend.

-J SHAFT IS NOW
INTO WHITE IRON
Superintendent Believes That'
Body of Copper Ore Lies
Below; Drifting Will Be
Started from 900 Level.
JEROME, Feb. 17. An unexpected
and probably important change has
taken place in the Pittsburg-Jerome
shaft.
At a depth of SS6 feet the shaft is
in white iron with a little copper
stain. White iron is regarded as a
splendid indication of copper.
It was not expected that anything
of importance would be disclosed by
the shaft itself. Superintendent C.
C. Arrata is much encouraged by the
present showing. He regards it as
certainty that there is big body of
copper under the iron.
The plan of development is to sink
the shaft to a depth of 900 feet and
then crosscut southward to get under
a lime contact and iron blowout, be
tween 600 and 700 feet distant.
The south crosscut from the 500-foot
level is being continued to tap this
same blowout and the face Is now 600
feet from the shaft. Within a short
time a winze will be started on the
copper showing which appeared in
the bottom of the crosscut last sum
mer. Hi0 feet from the shaft.
Superintendent Arrata returned a
few days ago from Fittsburg, where
he went to confer with the directors
of the Pittsjmrg-Jerome. He says he
was given a royal welcome and be
came more firmly convinced than e
er that the directors, all of whom are
wealthy men, will never quit until
they have a mine. It was only a few
months ago that the directors raised
floO.000 among themselves to contin
ue operations along the lines laid out.
and most of this sum is still in the
treasury.
Arnita saw C. R. Ballard, who was
here several months as field manager
for the Pittsburg-Jerome. Ballard ex
pects 'to pay the camp another visit
shortly.
HEAVY WATER FLOW
STOPS DUNDEE WORK
Owing to the heavy flow of water,
the work of sinking the Dundee-Arizona
shaft to depth cannot be resum
ed till a new compressor is received
and installed.
A pump at the 4'M-foot station and
a sinking pump in the shaft just be
low are lifting 41'00 gallons of water
an hour, but are making no impress
ion on th flow. They are working
only to half rapacity, and cannot be
worked to full capacity with the pres
ent 350-foot compressor.
Superintendent James W. Hubbard
informed the directors of the state of
affairs as soon as he became convinc
ed that the flow was heavier than had
teen expected and they replied that
a 500-foot machine had been ordered
by w ire. This, it' is believed, w ill be
sufficient to operate the pumps and
also the drills when the shaft is dry.
The flow of water is ttfrough the
shattered lime formation and across
the shaft. When the pumps are stop
ped the water rises only a foot or so.

December - January Report
Shows Scores of Fami'ies
Helped, With Mere in Need
in Warren District. !
At a recent meeting of the board of
control of the Warren District Relief
Association, a financial statement and
brief report 'of the work accomplished
by the association for the past two
months, December and January, were
given by the general secretary, Miss
Esther Cummings, the financial state
ment showing an expenditure of
$59S.81 during the two months men
tioned. Twenty-one different families re
ceived aid at various times during
these two months, whenever it was
found that aid was necessary, all of
such families being destitute on ac
count of illness in the family, or where
the husband had either died or desert
ed his wife and children, as well a3
from lack of employment, as it often
happens that people c'jnie here with
their families and are unable to find
work for several weeks or months,
and are obliged to receive more or
less help from some source until they
can help themselves.
At the Christmas season forty-seven
families were given a good Christmas
supply, the Elks lodge having made
up baskets for nineteen 'of these whose
names were provided by the associa
tion, while the liberal donations from
the churches, clubs and individuals
helped considerably in supplying the
remaining twenty-eight families at
that time. Some of these families
were not in actual need, but were un
able to afford any luxuries
Transportation was provided by the
Association in nine cases, six of which

sons back to their friends to be cared
for, or to a different climate, but
such people never were sent away
.uerely to be a charge on other com
munities. I'pward of sixty meals, as 'well as
a large amount of clothing, were sup
plied to transients, who appeared Pj
be worthy and anxious to find work,
as well as to those who were ill and
.mable to work. About three hundred
irticles of clothing were given on;
luring the two mouths t'j the various
amilies, individuals and school chil
Ircn in need or them, most of which
lothing was donated.
Employment has frequently been
.'omul for woimn and girls, and the

AVOID SICKNESS
says Au
Glass of hot witer before
breakfast daily keeps the
doctor away.
Sanitary science has of late made
rapid strides with results that are of
untold blessing to humanity. The lat
est application of its untiring research
is the recommendation that It is as
necessary to attend to internal sanita
tion tof the drainage system of the hu
man body as it is to the drains of the
house.
Those of us who are accustomed to
feel dull and heavy when we arise,
slittiug headache, stuffy from 1 cold,
foul tongue, nasty breath, acid stom
ach, can, instead, feel as fresh as a
daisy by opening the sluices of the
system each morning and flushing but
the whole of the internal poisonous
stagnant matter.
Everyone, whether ailing, sick or
well, should, each morning before
breakfast, drink a glass of real hot
water with a teaspoonful of limestone
phosphate in it to wash from the stom
ach, liver and bowels the previous
day's indigestible waste, sour bile and
poisonous toxins; thus cleansing,
sweetening and purifying the entire
alimentary canal before putting more
food into the stomach. The actioa of
hot water and limestone ph'osphate on
an empty stomach is wonderfully In
vigorating. It cleans out all the sour
fermentations, gases, waste and acid
ity and gives one a splendid appetite
lor breakfast. While you are enjoying
your breakfast the phosp'iated hot
water is quietly extracting a large vol
ume of water from the blJod and get
ting ready for a thorough fluhin of
all the inside organs.
The millions of people who are both
ered with constipation, bilious spells,
stomach trouble, rheumatic stiffness;
others wh'j have sallow skins, blood
disorders and sickly complexions are
urged to get a quarter pound of lime
stone phosphate from the drug store.
This will cost. very little, but is suffi
cient to make anyone a pronounced
crank on the subject of interna! san
itation. (Advertisement)

Mrs. Aug. Doellefeld ofCarlyle. 111.,
recently wrote lj Dr. Caldwell, at Mor

a number of years, and would not be
without it, as with it she has been
able to keep her four children in per

; Dr. Caldwell's Syrup Fep-dn ;s a
combination of simple laxative herbs
w ith pepsin that acts on the bowels in
an easy, natural way, and regulates
the action of this most important func
tion. ' Nearly all the sickness to which
children are subject is traceable to
bowel inaction, and a mild, depend
able laxative, such as Dr. Caldwell's
Syrup Pepsin should have a place in
every family medicine chest. It is
pleasant to the taste and children like
it, and take it readily, while it is
equally effective for adults.

A Free Prescription You Can H&ve
Filled and Use .t Home
Philadelphia, Pa. Victims of eye strain
and other eye wenknesses, and those w ho
wear glnssin, will be glad t" know tuat
according to Dr. Iewis there is mil hope
aud help for them. Many whow eyes
were failing say they hfve had their eyes
restored by this remarkable prescription
and many who oik wore glasses sny
they have thrown tin-in away. One iiiuti
snys, after using it: "I w:is almost blind.
Could not see to rend lit I'll. Now I can
read everything without my glasses Dd
my eyes do not hurt ulv more. At night
tbey would pain drenufully. Now they
feel fine all the time. It was like r
miracle to me.' A lady who used it s7C :
"The atmosphere wetmil hazy with or
without glasses, but after using this pre
wription for 15 days everything seems
clear. I can read even tine print with
out glasses." Another who used it say:
"I was bothered with eye Ftr;iin caused
by overworked, tired eyes which induced
fierce hendacln-s. I have worn ghisses fur
iwvpral years Wb for distance aud work,
and without them I could not read my
own nmiie on nn envelnM or the type
writing on the machine before me. I cmi
do both now nnd have discanb-d my long
di,tiince glasses nl together. I cim eoent
the fluttering leaves on the trees ncn.s
the street now, which for several year
have looked like a dim green blur to nie.
I cannot express my joy at what it bus
done for m.
It is believed thnt thousand who wear
glasses can now discard them in a reason
able time nnd multitudes more will be
able to strengthen their eyes so as to be
spared the trouble and expense of ever
getting glasses. Eye troubles of many
descriprions miiv be wonder'ully benefited
by the use of this prescription. (Jo to any J
active drug store and get a bottle of Bon
Opto tablets. Drop one Bon-Opto tablet
in n fourth of a glass of water and let i
it dissolve. With this liquid bathe the
eyes two to four times daily. You should
notice your eyes clear tip perceptibly right
from the nt:irt nnd inflammation and red
ness will quickly disappear. If your eyes
Ix.ther you even a little it is your duty to
tiihe steps to save them now before it
is too lute. Many hopelessly blind might
have saved their sight if they had cared
for ihcir eyes in time.

EVERYBODY
SEE HOW THE COMING WEEK MAY PRODUCE
- . THE FINAL WINNERS IN THE REVIEW'S AUTO
MOBILE CONTEST.
The last week of the Triple Vote offer of the Review's Greater Automobile and Priee Campaign
commences today. It is the all important period of Arizona's greates! subscription contest.
Eighteen candidates are lined up, and eighteen are going to slay with it until the last ballot is polled.
Every candidate is using her best endeavors to secure all the votes she can for the subscriptions given her.
Purely and simply it is a contest for votes derived from the paid-in-advance sale of The Bisbee Daily
Review. With each new subscription secured between now and ne:ct Saturday, February 24th., 9 P., M.,
the candidates so securing them are allowed votes in tri pie numbers, o? just three times as many votes as are
allowed for renewal subscriptions. 1
The work that a candidate does during this season of Triple Votes constitutes the backbone of hsr
campaign. To ask her to wait, to persuade her into believing that a tetter offer will appear at another period,
is suicide to ultimate success.
Never again during the life of this campaign will there be as good an offer as Triple votes, nor a bet
ter one. In fact, those who fail .to take in all the subscriptions they possibly can before next Saturday night,
will find themselves the losers by many thousands of precious votes.
And so will it be with each succeeding period of the merry contest, each period offering a less in
ducement of votes than the previous one, which means that during tie final week of the contest the vote
schedule will be reduced to a whisper.
Therefore, be guided by instructions as to vote schedules from headquarters. Anything that you
see printed in the contest columns of the Review is law and it is the rule of the management to adhere to all
of these laws regardless of whether they are proving satisfactory or otherwise from a financial standpoint of
The Review's circulation department. '
The safest course for any candidate to pursue is to work with the will and knowledge that the contest
editor is looking after the interests of all with the utmost impartiality. The Review is looking forward to mak
ing this contest a success both in the increase of circulation and the greatest possible satisfaction to the inter
ested candidates, their friends and the readers of its publication, and to this end it has offered the richest prizes
ever presented by an Arizona newspaper.

CHICAGO. Feb. 17. Many com
plaints that abnormally dry weather
in the southwest and west was caus
ing serious crop damage gave an up
ward slant to wheat today. The mar
ket closed unsettled at the same as
yesterday's finish to 1 1-2 higher, with
May 1.73 1-2 to 1.73 5-8 and July
1.48 3-4 to 1.49.
Corn wound up unchanged to 1-8
1-4 higher; oats gained 1-8 to 1-4 and
provisions showed aris 'of 10 to 20
cents.
Notwithstanding a good deal of
indecision at the outset, bulls In wheat
soon obtained an evident advantage
from messages that flooded in, telling
of poor crop prospects throughout a
large portion of the winter wheat belt,
especially Kansas and section of Mis
souri. There were predictions of a
fair sized decrease in the United
States visible supply total on Monday.
Disappointment over the absence of
anv new cxnort buying led tv some re -
action in wheat prices as the day ap-
proached an end. New crop months,
however, maintained a relatively firm
tone.

Cincinnati man tells how to
shrivel up corns so they
lift out.
Ouch !?!?!! This kind of rough
talk will be heard ess here in to n it
people troubled with corns will follow
the simple advice of this Cincinnati,
authority, who claims that a few drops
of a drug called freezone when applied
to a tender, aching corn stops sorne
ness at tnce, and soon the corn dries
up and lifts right out without pain.
He says freezone is a sticky sub
stance which dries immediately and
never inflames or even irritates the
surrounding tissue or skin. A quarter
of an ounce, which will cost v ery little
at any drog store, is said to be suffi
cient to remove every hard or soft
corn or callus from one's feeL Millions
of American women will welcome this
announcement since the inauguration
of the high heels. (Advertisement)

HAVE DARK HAIR
AND LOOK YOUNG
J Don't i&y gray! Nobody can
tell when you darken gray,
faded hair with Sage
Tea and Sulphur.
Grandmother kept her hair beauti
fully darkened, glossy and attractive
w ith a brew of Sage Tea and Sulphut
Whenever her hair took on that dull,
faded or streaked appearance, this
simple mixture was applied with won
derful effect. By asking at any dnr
I store for "Wyeth's Sage and Sulphur
j Compound," ybii will get a large bottle
of this old-tirae recipe, improved by the
j addition of other Ingredients, all ready
to use, for about 50 cents. This
simple mixture can be depended upon
to restore natural color and beauty
ro the hair.
A well-known, downtown druggist
says everybody uses Wyeth's Sage
and Sulphur Compound now because
It darkens so naturally and evenly
that nobody can tell It bas been ap
plied it's so easy to use, too. You
simply dampen a comb r soft brush
and draw it through your hair, taking
one,slrrnd at atime. By. morning the
gray bair disappears; after auotlier
application or two. it U restored to its
natural color and looks glossy, s'.'lt
and beautiful. This preparation Is a
delightful toilet requisite. It is Dotjof 4.120 acre.
