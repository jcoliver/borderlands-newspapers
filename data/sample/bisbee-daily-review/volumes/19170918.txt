''Comparative" Quiet Exists
Upon Western Front Brit

' Raiding Activities A ainst
Foes.
(By Review Leased Wire)
WITH THE BRITISH ARMIES IX
FRANCE AND BELGIUM. Sept 17.
There must always be periods tof "com
parative" quiet when big gun spectac-'
u!ar offensives are lacking on the
great fighting fronts. The recent days
have constituted one of these periods
along the British lines in the western
theater, and to the outside world, read
ing the commander-in-chiefs laconic
words, "There is nothing of impor
tance to report," or a brief account of
seemingly inconsequential raids, it
may appear that hostilities virtually
have ceased.
Artillery Active
But this conclusion is far from
right, for the grim business of war
continues perpetually. Hourly, the big
British guns hurl their thousands of
ttns of metal, carrying death and de-
struction into the German defenses;
dav and nieht ereat sauadrons of
ators guide their machines over the
.....
German lines and dump their cargoes .
of high explosives on important pot-I-l
tions. and continually small bodies of I
British infantry are reaching out info
the trenches and snatching tback pris -
oners after playing haoc and 'bombs
among the dugouts and mortars em -
placements.
Allies Benefit i
Of course, there is retaliation by the '
enemy, but the advantage rests with
the entente allies in this constant ham-
mering process. It is the steady drop-
ping of water which is wearing away
the stone.
Germans Strong
The terrible toll of death being ex-jby
acted from the enemy ran us Dy ine
artillery and the continual drainage of
their war supplies by the destruction
caused by sneus ana Domes are nav-
ing their effect. The German wall of
defense is still strong, but it is weak-
er than it was. and sooner or later
must crumble, if the allied method of
wearning down is continued. It needs
no military expert to figure this out

"The sixty years just passed must

the Pacific ocean, so illimitable to

common humanity, have been drawn
closer and ever closer, until today
we stand shoulder to shoulder as
friends and allies defying the power
of evil to destroy that splendid herit
age' which we are agreed to share.
Rosy Future
"I am convinced that with the
opening of this new chapter of inter

end of all time, our good understand
ing will increase. The road between
our homes will become more and more
the beaten track of neighbors.
Welcome Extended
"I am more than ever convinced
that we have done with the difficult
uages over which we labored in the
night of doubt, and that in the full
light of honest purpose, with the eyes
of faith and trust we shall both, as
nations free, strong and independent,
make more frequent pilgrimages to
the shrine we love you to Toklo,
where we hope to bid you welcome
soon, and we to Newport, whose bean
ty and wealth or hospitality exceeds

Ports Are Closed. Shipping
Board Chairman May Visit
Effected Districts On Mat
ter. (By Review Leased Wire.)
WASHINGTON, SepL 17. Strikes
in Pacific coast shipyards holding
government contracts have assumed
such serious proportions that Chair
man Hurley of the special shipping
board announced late today that he
was considering going to San Fran
cisco late this week in an attempt to
settle the trouble. "
Strikes at Seattle, Portland, Los
Angeles, San Francisco and other
points on the Pacific coast are now
holding up about 20 per cent of con
struction. The board hopes to settle all on a
basis to be determined for Seattle
yards within a few days.
May Increase Wage
Officials of the board conferred to
day with representatives of Seattle
yards and union leaders regarding an
agreement under which workers
would be given higher pay. with the
government paying a portion of the
increase. Working out of details
awaits the arrival here, probably on
Wednesday, of officials of a Seattle
yard which already has granted the
highest wage scale demanded by the
workers and who will explain the op
ttattaw of th syj-'ui. .
Conciliator Named
The shipping board today called on
the department of labor for assist
ance in settling the strikes, and Wil

ciliator, wps assigned to the work. lie
may accompany Mr. Hurley, who sail
he would go to the coast only If the
San Francisco strike did not appear
near settlement by the latter part of
the week.
Mistake Responsible
Reports reached the board today
that the San Francisco strike was
prompted partly by an erroneous im
pression on the part of the union
leaders that the high wage scale
granted by a single Seattle shipbuild
ing company bad teen agreed to by
all and ratified by the government..

marked the strike begun today of

Most of the disturbances were in con
nection with the strike, now iu its
sixth week, of a majority of the em

have expressed sympathy.
Today's strike caused a tieup of
$150,000,000 worth of government ship
building and engine construction con

and a few large machine shops were
affected, but the strike spread quick

INTERVIEW ATTRACTS NOTICE
(Rv Review Lecs-nl Vlr.)
LONDON. Sept. 17. The Associated
Press Interview with Admiral Lind
man, Swedish minister of foreign af
fairs, which was carried in the press
today, attracted wide attention in of
ficial circles, where astonishment was
expressed that the minister had not
yet made any similar expression of re
gret to the British government.
"We have been expecting a state
ment for Admiral Lindman along
these lines," said a foreign official,
"but we expected it would come in an
official way. An expression of regret
along these lines, if made in a tormal
way. would do much to smooth rela
tions. But thus rar Sweden has not
officially expressed any regret or of
fered any explanation.
"The foreign minister's statement
to the Associated Press covers the
ground quite broadly and we should be
very glad if he sees fit to repeat it la
substance in a formal communication
to us.
"We hope that the Associated ITess
Interview is the precurser of an of
ficial statement which will stand for
a basis of removal of any clouds be

700 guests; with red, white and blue
carnations mingling their fragrance
with the patriotic spirit In the air,
the many people in attendance forgot,
for a while, that they were in a little
border town. They were carried on
the wings of fancy to a great eastern
city. Naco, without many facilities
for staging a banquet, gave an affair
which in its complete elaborateness
left nothing to be wanted.
The evening opened with the rous
ing choral singing of "Columbia, the
Oem of the Ocean." Then, during the
serving of courses, music and enter
tainment features were . offered by
talented representatives of the people
of Naco. Piano solos, duets, readings
and a Spanish quartet of young wom
en made up a varied and thoroughly
delightful program.
After coffee and cigars, H. E. Ber
ner introduced the first speaker. Ma
jor Hayes. Major Hayes spoke in
place of Colonel Donkersley, who was
unable to attend because of sickness.
Responding to the toast, "Our Sam
mies" he told how our boys "Over
There" came to get their name, and
in a simple, graceful manner he ex
plained the duty of the men in whose
honor the banquet was given, and of
the great privilege which was theirs
in being called to the colors of their
country.
Major Hedicke spoke next on "Our
Navy." Dwelling impressively on thei
glorious traditions which our men of
the sea have handed down from gen
eration to generation since the birth
of the nation, the major brought en
thusiastic applause when he conclud
ed with the statement that the Amer
ican navy , was about to win greater
fame and honor.
Major Coykendall talked on "Our
Allies." Briefly and effectively he
sketched the parts which England.
France, Russia and Italy are now
playing In Christianity's war against
Teutonic barbarism.
Major Grinstead responded to the
toast, "The World War Our Part in
It." A quiet, forceful speaker, Grin
stead drove home in indelible lan
gauge just what war meant to the
United States, and what our allies are
expecting us to do
Miles Merrill, the popular president
of the Loyalty League of America,
was the next speaker. He departed

we hope to do our. bit in exterminat

Major Yount told, of the task of the,
Red Cross and of every woman's part
in Red Cross accomplishments. The
major was dignified and reserved, yet
genial. He was given the closest at
tention of his listeners, and their ap
plause told of the pleasure his speech
afforded.
The last speaker. Chaplain Horene,
responded to the toast, "God Bless
Our Country, Cur President and Our
Cause." A finished orator, he said
his say in burning language, and he
included in his remarks-an original
poem about the men in the First Ari
zona regiment and their mothers,
which concluded with an injunction to
them that
" for fame you need not thirst;
You have given the world your very
The Arizona First."
It was an appropriate beginning of
the end. With the singing of "The,
Star-Spangled Banner" by the entire
audience, the most elaborate affair
was ever attempted in Naco came to
a highly successful close.
No end of credit must be given to
H. E. Berner, the toastmaster and the
leading spiirt in the celebration. His
introductions were witty, short and
appreciative. He was graciousness
and hospitality personified.
Fcur of the men were present who
were drafted into the national army,
and the end of the evening left them
with the satisfaction of having been
the honor guests at a banquet which
was well worth while. Some forty
men, the most of whom were miners,
attended in a body from Bisbee. They
were members of the Loyalty League
of America. All in all. it was an event
of which Naco may well be proud,
and which the guests will not forget
for many a day.

Local Man Tells of Words in

Relative to the War
French Vocabulary Adapt
able. Ere long many more men from the
county will be leaving for the train
ing camps, and in a few months the
men who have already gone will be
in France.
"And when they get to France'
says Mac H. Donaldson of the local
"Y," "they are going to learn some
thing new in the way of choice
'slang.'
"Every type of soldier has his own
peculiar way of putting things. Kip
ling has for a long time kept us fa
miliar with the stock in trade expres
sions of the British Tommie,' but
even 'Tommie's' vocabulary has been
greatly enlarged during the past three
years. -
"When the tanks' put in their first
appearance one of the Scottish High
landers took a single look and then
solemnly swore off drinking for all
time. 'Tommie,' amused at the thought
of a comrade who imagined himself
'seeing them again,' promptly called
the tanks 'Them,' and the name stuck.
In justification to the Scotchman,
however, it must be remembered that
the occupants of the first 'Them' bad
a fishing pole with an officer's pink
"nightie" attached to the rear of the
huge machine as a sort of grotesque
tail. Almost any man might think,
viewing the rather startling effect,
that he was 'seeing them again.'
"A man who brings down seven or
more aeroplanes is known as an 'As.'
The pronunciation is 'ass,' but the
treatment accorded such a man isn't
at all in keeping with the way his
characterization sounds. Nothing is
too good in France for an 'As.'
Slackers
"The French frerra for a alacker is
an "embusque that is. some one who
lies hidden. It is usually applied to
any one that is not actually fighting.
"The first-line trenches are known
as 'the butcher shops," and when a
Frenchman who goes to such a posi
tion is questioned regarding his des
tination be remarks naivjly, 'a la
boucherie.'
"Whizz-Bangs"
"Sharpnel is something with which
every man who has been at the front
is more or less familiar, and 'Tommie'
calls the bursting shells 'whizz-bangs.'
The name itself is more completely
descriptive than any words could make
it.
" 'Tommie' also has named the
French girls. A miss is 'Prudence
when she refuses to smile at the .ever
flirtive Englishman, but when she re
turns his smile, and perhaps offers
two very pretty lips for a rather per
sonal salutation she is 'Suzette.'
The Spirt of France
The French spirit today is rather
peculiar. She fights on more or less
indifferently to the wishes of her al
lies, determined on one thing and one
alone. She is determined to win back
Alsace-Lorraine if she must spend the
blood of every man in France to do it.
But withal, it is a splendid spirit, and
we 6hould be proud of our temper
mental and gallant allies of the tri
color." BISBEE 6IBL WEDS

(By Review Leased Wire).
WASHINGTON, ;Sept 17. Colonel
George Montgomery, commanding of
ficer of the Frankfort arsenal was the
chief witness today before the house
sub-military committee investigating
of defective rifle cartridges at the ar
senal. He told how there had been
trouble with primers since last Jan
uary, resulting in the condemning of
millions of them by the arsenal's chiel
inspectors, of the purchase from pri
vate manufacturers and of the per
monent substitution in June of a pri
vately owner primer..
A chemical deftc which the inspec
tors could not detect was responsible
for the difficulty, the colonel said,
though he suggested that the commit
tee should go into that question with
the chief chemist. In addition to the
chemical detrioration, he said, there
had been insufficient drying of prim
ers in crowded ammunition ware
houses. Chairman Dent and other
members of the committee questioned
Col. Montgomery closely. In re
sponse to a query as to whether the
government did not have the right to
expect its chemists to find damaging
elements in ammunition, the witnes3
said, private concerns paid much
higher wages to their chemists.

Lawrence Leydjn and Harry B.

recently arrested in Kansas City, Mis

under the name of L. M. Edwards.
There was some mistake made as re

ing the draft law, as he registered in
Cochise county and was given a certi
ficate of exemption by the local board.
Leyden was employed here for some
time as a motnrman in one of the local

Correspondent )of Prospector
Tells of Arrest of "Wob
blies at Douglas and What
They Say.
A correspondent of the Tombstone;
Prospector who was in Douglas on
Friday last sent the following to that
paper which was published in its is
sue of Saturday:
Your correspondent on invitation of
Deputy Sheriff Percy Bowden took
part in and witnessed the arrest and
capture of thirteen Wobblies from
Columbus yesterday afternoon near
here. A train in two sections was
due here at 5:15 and 5:30 p. m., re
spectively. So Percy and your cor
respondent jumped aboard the "Yel
low Peril" and Percy "gave her the
gun," and in a jiffy we were at Lee
Station, awaiting the first section. It
arrived and three Mexican I. W. W.'s
dropped off and Percy nailed them
"pronto." We loaded them in the
boat and followed the train, and soon
after one dropped off and Percy added
another passenger. We drove to the
edge of town, where other cars and
officers were waiting, and just then
the second section arrived, and, look
ing back about half a mile, we saw
five Wobblies making their get-away
to the south, so Percy left the Pros
pector man in charge of his four-passenger
and off he goes afoot. When
he got near them they ran for fair,
end when he got close enough he fired
a shot in the air, and from where
your correspondent was it looked as
i if Percy had "got his man," for he
dropped; but only to hide in the tall
grass, and soon Percy brought in his
man with three others he captured
on the way out after the first round.
The rest brought in thirteen, of which
number Percy got seven. They were
taken to the city jail and there your
correspondent gave them the once
over. It was a tough-looking bunch.
Italked to four of the Mexicans and
asked them about Bill Cleary. Of him
i they said:
"Por Bill Cleary!"
"Me no caro."
"Bill Cleary vamos por California."
! "Mucho Dinero."
i "Bill Cleary no foeno."
i They will go to Bisbee tomorrow.
1 There were seventeen on the two
! trains, four getting away, and unless
! the four go into Mexico they will be
. captured soon.

LETTER TELLS OF
FORT JLEY CAMP
Topeka Medico Writes Bisbee
Friend Telling Him of
Great Training in Prepara
tion for tbe National Draft.
Dr. James G. Stewart, of Topeka,
Kan., a young doctor, exempt from
the draft, with a fine and growing
practice, enlisted for the medical corps
for the term of the war. He came
from a fighting Scotch family, and
he simply could not bide at home
when there was a chance of fishtin
in France, where so many brave Scots
ha' died. Writing to a friend in Bis
bee about the big training camp at
Fort Riley, where the Bisbee contin
gent is quartered, this patriotic and
idealistic young medico describes his
feelings briefly as follows:
"There are thirteen companies ot
medicos, 150 each, here in the camp,
so you see there is quite a bunch of
us. The procedure which we are go
ing through is called intensive train
ing, and the term is most applicable.
We begin the day at 5:15 a. m. and
quit at 9 p. m.. having an hour for
ourselves from 9 to 10 p. m., when the
lights go out.
"The psychology of preparing men
for war is wonderful to watch. The
enthusiasm is contagious in a camp
of this size, and the intensity of tne
whole thing is past belief. When they
first come to camp the men growl
and complain. Then along comes a
regular army officer, and in a wonder
ful talk shows them the proper view
point, which are the real ones get.
And then commences the terrific drive
to get them into shape and make them
amenable to discipline and teach them
to take care of themselves."

shares of tLe stock of the corrpany
ate owned in this district, and an
other 100,000 in Douglas. The total
cf upwards of 300,0 i0 shsres is dis

300 people here and in Douglas. Since
last week nearly $1 hag been added
t tie value of each share by market
advance. The following telegram re

Charles McDonald Trom A. B. Frame,
managing director o the company,
indicates that much more advance
can be anticipated by the sharehold

Blockaders and obstructors still bold forth in the
United States senate. That their number has been
reduced to five Is an encouraging sign of the times.
That is a less number of barnacles than the senate
has contained in times of crisis since it was established.
No one seems to know very much about the Italian of
fensive except the Italians themselves', and they won't
telL Last Friday the dispatches carried a glorious and
ringing tale of the capture of San Gabrielle. But Friday
night there was not a word of further confirmation or ex
ultation on the great exploit. If they have really taken
this heighth they have won one of the greatest victories
of the war and will soon be able to widen the Austrian
front and take Treiste and compel the Austrians to use
twice as many men to hold them. It means that Ger
many will have to send soldiers to thisront Consider
ing the reported success of the Italian arms there is a
most remarkable dearth of news from this front The
fact Is, since America entered the war, all news from all
fronts has been censored to a point where the ordinary
citizen gets but little information. Why this should be
done is hard to tell. Any successes won are known to
the German staff immediately and how it can do any
harm for the American public to be given the details is
past comprehension. The war office should go through
one course of rinsing water; it has too much starch.
A member of the Swiss commission to the United
States has declared that if America enforces the embar
go against his country that Switzerland will perish. He
makes a most eloquent and convincing plea for grain and
meat in the name of Swiss neutrality. But evidence
shows that Switzerland is the most reprehensible of all
the neutral countries in the matter of professing friend
liness to the allies and sending food to Germany. Swiss
imports from this country have been enormous ever since
the war started. She has been a clearing house for
American meat and grain to the blockaded Prussians.
She has helped Prussia more than one hundred thous
and armed men in the field could have done. She has
imported thousands of tons of fats and grains and meats
and sold them to Prussia at enormous profits and now
she sends a commission to these shores and begs for
something to eat. She has the gold but not the food.
Prussian pressure caused the thirfty Swiss to practically
violate neutrality. Quite a contrast with Belgium. The
allies and Uncle Sam will fight for Belgium to the last
dollar and the last man, but for Switzerland they have
nothing but distrust and dislike as they contemplate her
perfidous record.
Another offensive on a grand scale is confidently
looked for from the English in Flanders or Belgium be
fore the snow flies in Europe. Nothing has been beard
from the brave Canadians before Lens for three weeks.
Haig has reported nothing but raids and artillery duels
in that time. One more smash will not break the Hln
denburg line but it may well crack it and bend it back.
Surely the British will take the Lens coal district before,
winter and make the last effort for either Lille or the
U-boat bases. Such an exploit would hearten all the al
lies for the winter and discourage the Germans Just that
much. But one thing must be borne in mind in connec
tion with the nineteen-seventeen campaign. All along
the line from Verdun to the North Sea, the allies have
the high ground for winter. Last winter It was the re
verse. The next six months will be one long season of
torment, hardship, pressure, 'death and harassment for
the German armieB holding their thin strip of foreign
soil, ' They hold still, do the Prussians, but they mill
pay dearly for their Hindenburg line, and then "when
spring comes' round again with rustling shade, worried,
worn and wounded, they will have to withstand an offen
sive, the magnitude snd power of which will lie triple
that of anything the allies have launched before.
THE CHURCH MILITANT.
With a monstrous big army In the process of building,
thousands of men of the cloth are entering the service
as chaplains. No especial qualifications are required
of them they must be ordained, and they must come
up to the physical requirements of the government whoso
uniform they wear. But a most important element has
obviouly been overlooked. Too many men who are en
tering this work with the right sort of spirit, but with
the wrong make up. There are chaplains In the United
States who stand before their men one day each week
and tell them of the horrors they must face and of the
dangers they must brave, and of the sufferings they must
experience and of the home-ties to be broken forever.
And they don't stop there. They go on and rid them
selves of platitudes of doubt as to our ability to win the
war unless the men of the ranks take the war more ser
iously and come closer to God; and occasionally they
wind up with a mournful word picture of the desolation
and famine that will sweep the land with the coming of
peace.
The Germans still believe that God is on their side, and
and we believe He Is on ours; but irrespective of His
choice, it is the duty of every chaplain in the army to
keep all mournful visualizing to himself and to fill the
minds and the hearts of our "Sammies" with hope and
cheer and faith. And it is the duty of the men who pass
upon these chaplains to see that they are of the red
blooded type whose every sermon contains a powerful
punch, whose every thought is the ultimate and smash
ing victory of the men whom they spiritually lead, and
who can see nothing in their mind's eye save .the glory
and the ever increasing glory of the United States of
America. For a pattern, they need go no further than
ZeBarney Phillips, of St. Louis, who was the first min
ister in the country to have the starry flag carried be
hind the Cross in his church, and who somehow makes
you think that the Christ was less of the sad faced m?n
of sorrows and more of the big, wholesouled, smiling
sort sweet and gentle with His children, but withal,
very much of a Man's Man among men. It is this type
of clergymen that the army needs for its chaplains.
NIPPING THE I. W. W. CONSPIRACY.
(New York World.)
Assuming that in its searches and seizures the depart

made no mistake in proceeding vigorously against the
W. W. From its inception the organization has been
openly and defiantly criminal. Of late it has added to
its other offenses a suggestion of treason.
While the chieftains of this body have pretended to
operate under cover of the labor movement, they are
In truth nothing but marauders - and law breakers, as
much at war with honest labor as with society and law.
Their membership Is drifting and transitory. They have
made a living by misleading the ignorant and the turbu
lent, and although most of them merited punishment lorg
ago, they have been tolerated in a score of states on the
theory that instead of promoting and profiting by crime
they were serving industry.
. First during the period of neutrality and afterward in
the presence of war, this consipracy has found many op
portunities to instigate lawlessness. That it has acted
in the interest of the enemy, if not in his pay, is self-evident.
Its hostility to government and people has been
undisguised. The connection between its openly pro
claimed threats of sabotage, assault, arson and other
forms of intimidation and the actual perpetration of these
offenses has been close enough to justify prosecutions al
most without number.
Raiding the offices and homes of the miscreants who
are chiefly responsible for these felonies, the department
of justice can hardly have failed to find evidence enougli
to convinct the leadersh and end this conspiracy against
the Nation at war.

The Arizona Range News of Will

Speaking at a patriotic mass meeting in New York
City recently, Charles Kdward Russell of the AmeTican
commission to Russia, declared that a separate peace
between Russia and Germany meant five years more of
bitter war with Germany. And he declared further that
the speeches and obstruction tactics of a half dozen U.
S. Senators were responsible for the demoralization of
the Russian army defending Riga, and hence the capture
of that stronghold by tne Prussians. Russell may be
inclined to exaggerate a little, but at that his declara
tions should be taken most seriously by the American
people and press as a whole. 'They are full of truth.
A separate peace with Russia will centainly mean en
extra year of war and probably two. The wilfull and
egotistical treason of a little group in congress may
well have been distorted and magnified by Prussian

The process of heating water for domestic purposes has been rev
olutionized in the past few years through the introduction and
perfection of gas fired water heaters, until today it is no longer a
a problem to secure an abundance of hot water quickly and econo
mically, in any dwelling, large or small.
Today, in the countless thousands of homes where gas fired water heaters are in
stalled, an abundance of hot water is available for any purpose. By some types of heat
ers the water is heated instantly at the turn of a faucet, by others, within a few min
utes after lighting the heaters, and all without labor, inconvenience or discomfort, and
at a reasonable cost for gas.

Time- curing
Take two Pianos, one with a sounding-board
fashioned from well-seasoned
wood, another with a sounding
board made from illy-seasoned wood.
The one will have a beautiful tone,
the other a poor tone. It's simply a
matter of careful time-seasoning.
j OWL Cigar flavor and OWL Cigar
fragrance too depend on the proper
i time-curing of good tobaccos.
u And Owl time-curing requires that we
keep constantly on hand at least $1,000,000
worth of selected tobaccos. It requires that
Father Time exert his mellowing influence
on Owl leaf for a period of many months.
And experts must constantly watch OWL
leaf with keen eyes on the exact point of
OWL "readiness."
Owl Cigar fragrance and OWL Cigar
mellowness testify how well Father Time
and his experts do their work.
Let an Owl Cigar give you personal
evidence of its mellow fragrance. The cigar

TQ OUR TRADE AND THE PUBLIC:
You thought we had an axe to grind when we told you by letter and through the press
TO BUY COAL NOW. Read below what the. INDIANA RETAIL COAL MERCHANTS AS
SOCIATION for the entire state of Indiana has to say, and then come in and talk it over
with us:
i
Byy Coal Now
SAMUEL INSULL, Chairman of the Illinois State Council of Defense, made the following
public statement a few days ago to the people of Chicago, and we repeat his words as a
WARNING with equal force to the people of. Indiana.
"WHETHER OR NOT THE PRICE IS AS LOW AS IT SHOULD BE IS BESIDE
THE QUESTION. IF WE DO NOT BUY AND STORE COAL NOW. IT IS DOUBT
FUL WHETHER WE SHALL BE ABLE TO GET IT IN THE FALL AT ANY
PRICE."
The days when the consumer should be geting his coal are rapidly passing, and each day
of delay makes the outlook just that much darker for the coming winter. High prices are
serious enough in themselves, but there is something even WORSE THAN HIGH PRIC
ES staring us all in the face, and that it a
Coal Famine This
m
I
The retail coal merchants realize their obligation to supply the coal that the people need.
While they desire to sell at as low prices aa possible, PRICE IS SECONDARY TO THE COAL
ITSELF. Most of the retail coal merchants have coal in their yards now for which they
have paid the high prices demanded at the mines: They are prepared to deliver this coal
now at prices that are reasonable on the basis of mine cost and handling expense.
The present supply, however, will be only a drop in the bucket. TWO WEEKS OF
NORMAL BUYING WILL CLEAN OUT EVERY RETAIL COAL YARD IN THE STATE.
While there are cars to haul the coal, the yards can be filled again quickly, but with Increas
ing transportation of war equipment and supplies and regular heavy fall and winter ship
ping, this favorable condition will not exist. When cold weather comes, everyone will
want coal all at once. THERE WILL BE A DEMAND TEN TIMES GREATER THAN THE
AVAILABLE SUPPLY and at that time it will be impossible to renew the supply quickly.
THE RESULT MUST BE HUNDREDS AND THOUSANDS OF COLD HOMES THIS WIN
TER. Whether prices are lower or not, we urgs the people of Indiana not to wait. Lower
prices will help no one when there is no coal. There is only one way to be certain to be
warm this winter and that is to BUY YOUR COAL NOW.
We present these facts, not for the sake of sales and profits to the retail coal mer
chant, but in the hope that through serious consideration of this warning, the people
may be able to get the coal necessary to Keep Indiana homes warm this winter.
This is the seventh in a series of talks to the public
Indiana Retail Coal Merchants Association
These people are in the very heart of the COAL BELT where cheap coal should prevail
and but little if any possibilities of a coal famine. If the entire State is urged to buy
there what aught the PEOPLE OF BISBEE, ARIZONA, do.'

THE BISBEE DAILY REVIEW, TUESDAY MORNING, SEPTEMBER 18, 1917.
1 Mining and Financial News
BY REVIEW
NEW YORK FINANCIAL
(By Review Leased Wire.
NEW YORK. Sept. 17. Another,
sharp break in stock resulted today
from a resumption of selling opera
tions. Professonal operators were
bearish. Toward the close the move
ment was reversed on short covering
and losses of one to three points were
reduced considerably. Total sales,
690,000 shares.
The recession seemed to be due to
the continuing influence of conditions
with which the market had been con
fronted for some time.
Bethlehem Steel broke to a new Jow
figure with a decline of 7 points to
9. New low points also were reached
by United States . Steel and Midvale.
Coppers also yielded to pressure.
Further weakness appeared in ship
pings. St. Paul was again conr-'cu-ously
weak, selling off 3 to a new
low quotation of 56. Reading gave
way to 77. and Norfolk also reached
the lowest orice of the movement.
Bonds were heavy. Total sales, pr
value, $3,230,000. Liberty bonds sola
at 99.98 to 1000. United States cou
pon 2's lost and United States cou
pon 4's advanced on call. Panama
3's coupon rose 4 points.
GRAIN MARKET
CHICAGO. Sept. 17. Corn slid
downward in value today, influenced
mainly by the prevailing Ideal weather
for maturing the crop. Prices, al
though steady at the close, were 1 to
1 net lower at 1.15 to 1.15 De
cember and 1.12 to 1.12 and 1.13
May. Oats finished 1 to 1 oft. In
provisions the outcome ranged from
25c decline to a gain of 50c.
General selling of corn started as
soon as trading began. Optimism in
regard to the crop outlook offset bull
ish foreign news. Oats sympathized
with the weakness in corn. Some
suport was given in the last ha
hour of the day.
Arrivals of wheat showed a notable
enlargement, especially in the north
west. Gossip was current that no
foreign shipments would be made ex
cept on the strictest rationing basis.
Provisions showed much firmness
fora while, but fell under the Influ
ence of the decline in corn. '
Closing Quotations September 17, 1917
(By L J. Lovelock)
NEW YORK. Sept. 17. The market
was a liquidating one from the start,
with pressure directed chiefly against
the steel stocks, where in some in
stances sharp declines were recorded.
There was no special news in circula
tion other than reports of labor trou
bles on the Pacific coast and the well
defined prospects of rather stiff mon
ey rates for the near and distant fu
tures. The steady liquidation of the
so-called high-grade investment stocks
and bonds and the unwillingness of
the public to make purchases even at
the considered low levels are the fac
tors primarily responsible fo the day's
depreciation in quoted values. It Is
quite natural that to conform to the
new order of things growing out of
our active participation in hostilities
abroad the investment situation be
subjected to the readjustment which
has been in progress for a consider
able period. It must not be forgotten,
however that liquidation during the
summer has been conducted on a tre
mendous scale and many of the bad
features of the situation probably dis
counted. Therefore the appearances
of constructive influences are likely
to be followed by a sharp enhance
ment in prices. As long as aggres
sive banking support is withheld the
element working on the selling side
will probably make further headway.
