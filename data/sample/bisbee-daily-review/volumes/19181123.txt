(By Review Leased Wire)
WASHINGTON, Nov. 22. Wil
liam Gibbs McAdoo, secretary of
the treasury, director general ot
railroads and often described as
one of the presidential possibili
ties of 1920, has resigned his of
fices to return to private business.
President Wilson has accepted his
resignation. Mr. McAdoo will give
up the treasury portfolio as soon
as a successor has been, selected.
He wished to lay down hi3 work
as directing general ot railroad
- by January 1, but will remain if
the president has not then chosen
a successor.
Upon the new secretary of the
treasury, whoever he may be, will
devolve the task of financing the na
tion through the transition period of
war to peace, which probably will
- Include at least two more Liberty
loans and possibly also a further re
Vision of the system of war taxation.
Letters between President Wilson
and Mr. McAdoo, made public today
with the announcement of the resigna
tion, give Mr. McAdoo's reasons for
leaving the cabinet solely as a neces
sity for replenishing his personal for
tune and express the president's deep
regret at losing his son-in-law from
his official family.
The following letters were made
public with the announcement:
Letter of Resignation
Mr. McAdoo's letter of resignation
dated November 14, follows:
"Dear Mr. President:
"Now that an armistice has been
signed and peace is assured, I feel
at liberty to advise you of my desire
to return, as soon as possible, to
private life.
"I have been conscious for some
time of the necessity for this step,
but, of course, I could not consider
it while the country was at war..
"For almost six years I have work
ed incessantly under the pressure of
great responsibilities. Their exactions
have drawn heavily on my strength.

ENGLISH CORRESPONDENT AFT
ER INVESTIGATING WRITES TO
LONDON DAILY MAIL THAT
FORMER EMPEROR DARE NOT
RETURN TO HIS NATIVE LAND
LONDON, Nov. 22. From a special
Investigation in western Germany the
correspondent of the Daily Mail at
The Hague has ascertained there is
considerable hostility against the
former emperor there. The corre
spondent says that after Wilhelm
Hohenzollern entered Holland a
thousand German soldiers arrived at
the frontier and demanded they be
allowed to pursue and kill him. They
were turned back by Dutch frontier
guards.
The correspondent does not believe
the former emperor could reach Ber
lin In safety, no matter what guar
antees might be given. The former
crown prince is universally "bated
also. His life in Germany, the cor
respondent declares, would not be
worth an hour's purchase. He Is un
der close guard in Holland on fears
of attack.
Much publicity is being given to
Eitel Friederich and August Wilhelm,
respectively, the second and fourth
pons of the former emperor, and the
correspondent's Impression is that the
royalists' hope is that through them
dynastic sympathy can be maintained.

Sinkings
LONDON, Nov. 22 (British Wireless
Service). Twenty more German sub-1
marines were surrendered to Admiral
Sir Reginald Tyrwhltt. off Harwich
this morning.. This makes a total of
69 submarines thus far banded over.
There would have been 21 surrender
ed today, but one sank during the
night.
When the Germans arrived the rev
olutionary element was noticeable.
Some of the officers had replaced
Prussian eagles on their caps with a
red badge that recognized authority
of the sailors and soldiers' council.
There seemed to be little discipline
among them. To the officers one
shouted:
"No officer no kaiser."
Some of the Germans were anxious
to air such English as they possessed.
One German officer. Inclined to be
communicative, attached himself to
the correspondent and said he worked
In London before the war. He add
ed: "I had an intimation, (many of us
had) that we should be wanted in the
summer of 1914, so I went back to
Germany a month or two before war
was declared. I was not in the sub
marine service at first, but volun
teered for it and bad a fair share of
luck. You British say It was not fair
fighting, but we Germans believe that
the end justifies the means. Then
you complain that we shoot your men
while they are In the water. Why
not? The men might be saved to
fight us another day. We should be
fools to let them."
The crews of one submarine, ex
cept an officer, were Intoxicated.

WASHINGTON, Nov. 22. The sen

showing methods adopted in the or

record of the senate 'investigating
committee today by Major E. Lowry
Humes, who is in charge of the in
quiry. These records deal with the organ
ization and financing of the National
Association of Commerce and Labor,
disbursements to the German-American
alliance, the employment of spe
cial writers for beer propaganda and
a suggestion to Hugh F. Fox, secre
tary of the association, that the brew
ers offer a prize for the best essay
on the solution of the -."saloon prob
lem' with the co-operation on news
papers as a medium of publicity. The
Hearst papers were suggested in this
connection. t
Other records included a suggestion
that efforts be made to induce J. C.
Pritchard, former federal judge of
Asheville, N. C, and a prohibition ad
vocate, to write a letter to a brewer
soliciting funds with a view to dis
crediting him. Other documents in
cluded letters purporting to show that
a Miss I. T. Martin was employed
to attend a meeting of the anti-saloon
league in Alliance City, N. J., in 19-15
to report the proceedings to the brew
ers, and in August ot the same year
she attended a meeting of a Catholic
prohibition society in Niagara Falls,
was elected secretary and subse
quently destroyed the records of the
session. She was on the association's
payroll at $300 a month, according to
the records.
The committee heard only one wit
ness today, but before adjourning to
December 3, it decided to take up at
that time a general inquiry into Ger
man propaganda. Alexander Konta of
New York, who has been mentioned
In connection with the German propa
ganda movement, will be called to tes
tify probably immediately after the
inquiry is resumed.
The name of the person suggesting
the essay contest on the saloon was
not given. He pointed out the ad
vantage of working through the news
papers in bringing the prize essay to
the attention of the public instead of
the association taking it up directly.

WASHINGTON, Nov. 22 Resigna

secretary of war and director of air
service, and of William C. Potter, hi3
chief assistant, was announced today
by Secretary Baker. Both Mr. Ryan

After the retirement of Mr. Ryan

officials now that a new director
should be named in Mr. Ryan's place.
There is no longer a production prob

organization of the army and the war

is not possible to arrange for the
permanent aircraft establishment of
the army. Mr. Ryan, who was presi

WASHINGTON. Nov. 22. Reduc
tions aggregating $500,000,000 in the
yield from the new war revenue bill
were made today by the senate
finance committee in revising the
measure downward to the- six billion
dollar total for 1919 proposed by Sec
retary McAdoo. The decrease was
confined principally to tobacco. lux
ury, semi-luxury and other special and
excise schedules.
Among the more important de
creases today were elimination of the
luxury schedule proposed in the house
bill, levying 20 per cent on costly
articles of clothing and other things,
and supposed to raise $44,235,000.
Elimination of the hou.se tax of 2
cents a gallon on gasoline, estimated
to yield $40,000,000; reduction from
10 to 5 per cent, or about $200,000,000
in revenue in rates on many articles
classed as semi-luxuries and a reduc
tion of about one-half the house rates
on tobacco about $54i000.00 in
revenue.
The committee deferred decision on
the plan, suggested by Secretary Mc
Adoo, and specifically presented yes
terday by Chairman Simmons, for in
corporating in the measure specific
rates for 1920 Ktaxation. by which
the total revenue yield would be lim

(By the Associated Press.) Gen

Luxemburg this afternoon ahead of
his troops. The American commander-in-chief
drove into the capital in
automobiles. The general was greet
ed by thousands of cheering Luxem
burgers and with the blowing of sirens
and the ringing of church and school
Dells. ,
The Eighteenth infantry of the
First division were the first American
troops to enter the city.
The Americans were greeted by
thousands of civilians, who lined all
the streets through which the troops
marched. School children tossed
flowers in their pathway, and each
soldier, was presented a bouquet of
chriMinthemums.
Brig. Gen. Prank J. Parker's visit to
Premier Emil Reuter and his presen
tation to the members of the cabinet
brought the assurance that the gov
ernment was in thorough accord with
the Americana. There was evident a
spirit of heartfelt relief that the Ger
mans had gone. It was arranged that
ministers of state and the municipal
authorities should continue their
functions, the Americans' part in af
fairs being nothing more than to
make of Luxemburg a link in the lines
of communication and to stand pre

ISSUES INITIAL
PROCLAMATION
Commander of All-Russian
Army and Fleet Makes
' Pronouncement Concern'
ing His Policies
VLADIVOSTOK, Thurs, Nov., 21
(By the Associated Press). The first
proclamation of Admiral Alexander
KolicJiak, as commander of the all
Russian army and fleet, is addressed
to the people of Russia. It is dated
at Omsk. November 19, and declares
the aims of the dictatorship. These
aims are:
"The erection of a fit army, the
conquest of bolshevlsm. the organiza
tion of right and order so that the
people can select the form of govern
ment they desire without hindrance
and be able to achieve their ideas ol
liberty."
The resolution appeals for united
action in the struggle against bo!
shevism and continues:
"The all-Russian government has
gone to pieces. Having decided to
bear the burden of the cross, declare
I will not follow the road of reaction,
or the road of a party struggle which
would lead to oblivion."
Lieutenant General Horvath has is
sued an appeal to the people to re
main quiet during the transition pe
riod, assuring them that "a single
firm authority will bring a return of
the former glory of our ruined and
exhausted coutnry."
The censorship at Omsk is strict
and only official dispatches are ar
riving here. It is understood that
General Semenoff. the anti-bolshevik
leader in Siberia refuses to recognize
the dictatorship of Admiral Kolichak.

The ' Bavarian reserve division,
through its counsel, protests against
the attempt of the Berlin soldiers'
and workmen's council to interfere
with the present government's pur
pose to work out a system of repre
sentative government. In a resolu
tion these soldiers say:
"We want a national assembly and
a voice ill the work of solving the
problems of the German people. We
believe the present government is
willing that we shall have such par
ticipation and that It' opposes any
measures calculated to disturb the
economic system. We have nothing
in common with the resolution of the
Berlin soldiers' and workmen's coun
cil, which does not possess our con
fidence." The soldiers' committee of the
fourth army announces from Aix-la-Chapelle
that it opposes any form of
dictatorship. "Germany was the
cradle of social thought," the commit
tee says. "We do not need to take

The people of Luxemburg made
elaborate preparations to receive the
Americans. Almost every building
flew the Luxemburg Hag. with here
and there an American banner, and
every once iu a while a picture of
President Wilson could be seen, al
most always coupled with that of
Marshal Foch.
Some 40 societies had made plans
to participate in the parade of the
Americans and late Wednesday night
a band was heard iu a last rehearsal
of the music it expected to play to
day. The keenest interest was mani
fested by the civilians, who eagerly
questicned every American as to the
route and exact time of the march
into the city. The citizens raked up
school-book English, which tliey used
freely on every one wearing khaki.
General Pershing issued this proc
lamation shortly after the entry of
the Americans:
"After the four years of violation

YANK SOLDIER THINKS
OF HIS MOTHER FIRST
WITH THE AMERICAN ARMIES
IN THE FIELD. Oct. 15 (Correspond
ence of the Associated Press). When
an American soldier goes "over the
top" or when he receives a bullet or
shrapnel wound he thinks of his
mother. The French poilu thinks oi
his wife, and the'Pritish Tommy of
his sweetheart.
This fact is borne out by the offi
cers and doctors who have served in
all three of the allied armies. They
declare that when the American sol
dier is wounded the first word on liis
lips in almost every case Is "mother."
Even after he is removed to the hos
pital he calls constantly for his moth
er. His British cousin, however,
seems chiefly absorbed in his sweet
heart, and longs to see her "just once
again," while the French compatriot
thinks only of his "femme bien aimee '
The correspondent of the Associ
ated Press at the American front ask
ed a number of soldiers what thought
was most on their minds when they
first left their trenches to attack the
German. In nine cases out of ten
the answer was. "Of heme and
mother."
There were a few, however, who
said that as they entered the battle
their minds were given over wholly to
prayer, although they had never be
fore been in the habit of praying.
Some of them kept before tiiem words
of eneouragt ment and counsel con
tained in letters from relatives.
One soldier on the morning of the
attack received a letter rom Ws
mother quoting the Scriptural phrase.
"Trust in the Lord and no enemy
shall 'prosper against, thee." The sol
dier went through one of the blood
iest battles of the war that day and
came out unscathed.

THE THREE PATHS
(New York Tribune.)
There are three ways the allies can treat
Germany. There are three attitudes which
we, as individual Americans, can assume
toward her.
The first would be revenge.
The second would treat her with senti
mental tenderness.
The third would seek justice. '
The two extremes we conceive to be
equally dangerous, equally irrational, equ
ally destructive of the finer stuff of our
hearts and minds. The means of justice,
. difficult as it, is to cleave to, holds the one
hope of peace and right and progress.
Alike in the spirit of revenge and in the
mushiness of sentimental tenderness, easy
feeling blots out reason and all finer emo
tions. Brute, blinding anger and hate are
the springs of a desire for revenge. If we
give way to these primitive emotions, we
should demand an eye for an eye, we
should murder and rape in Germany as
German soldiers murdered and raped in
France and Belgium. We should dismem
ber and enslave the German nation. By
so yielding we should end a war begun in
the defense of law and right and for the
protection of the weak in a chaos of brutal
ity. We should indeed sink ourselves to
the level of our enemies.
The other extreme is based on a mass
of soft emotions that are fine or foolish, ac
cording as they are or not devoted to right
and controlled by intelligence. The parallel
is complete. Anger and hate are fine and
true and enobling when they are righteous
and unselfish. They are part, and an im
portant part of every stalwart right-doer.
It is only when they reach the point of
blind rage and extinguish reason and the
sense of right and wrong that they become
evil. So with pity and kindness and ten
derness and mercy. They are part and par
cel of our finest civilization. But when
they envelop and dissolve all other emo
tions and all thought and reduce a human
being to a quivering, shuddering, non-resistant
they become a positive menace.
You can observe these two extremes in
the bringing up of children, in the punish
ment of criminals. The angry, cruel par
ent harms irretrievably both himself and
his victim. The too lenient, sentimentaliz
ing parent, who is too tender hearted to re
buke or control or punish does surely not
less harm. We have abandoned our old
prison methods because they were destruc
tive and brutal. But there is another ex
treme, equally dangerous, in which fche
sentimental and kind-hearted person shuts
his eyes to the facts and would treat the
criminal as a sort of martyred hero, to the
destruction of all reform and to the very
great peril of the community.
Justice, the golden mean, is no easy road
to travel. It means a vastly complicated
decision, based on a clear knowledge of the
facts, doing right by all concerned, com
munity as well as criminal. It demands
patience, resolution, wisdom. In the case
of Germany it means first of all, insuring,
so far as possible, the safety of the world
against a repetition of the German crimes,
by either Germany or others. To let Ger
many now go scot free and to welcome her
at once back into the family of nations as
an equal would be to commit the same sort
of error which the weak, foolishly tender
mother commits when she refuses to pun
ish her child who does something positively
dangerous to other children. If we are
wise and just we shall bring home the enor
mity of German crimes against civilization
by the very homely and normal method
that every parent uses !of making Ger
many repair, as far as possible, the damage
she has done. We shall then hold her a
prisoner of civilization for a period of pro
bation. Such a sentence must necessarily
be indeterminate. It may not operate equ
ally against all the central powers. Time
alone can tell.
There is no real quarrel between the
punishment due the world for its protec
tion and the punishment due to Germany
for her salvation. Save in a world of re
venge the goal is identical in " each. W
must reform Germany, if we can, for the
good of the world, as well as for her own
good. We cannot possibly reform her by
dissolving in tears and acting as if black
were white and persuading her by our
maudlin loving-kindness that murder and
rape and faithlessness are peccadilloes not
worth mentioning.
We must learn to forgive Germany and
the German people lest rancor and blind
hatred warp our minds and vindictiveness
destroy the possibility of peace. We must
equally never forget what Germany has
done. We must devote our best wisdom
and patience to the task of punishing her
resolutely and fairly that her people may
see their sin and turn from it.
POPULAR LEGISLATION
(Phoenix Republican.)
According to official election returns,
the people for the first time voted heavily
and fairly discriminatingly on the various
propositions submitted to them. Hitherto,
such proposed legislation was looked upon
with suspicion. Much of it was in the
beginning untried, socialistic and revolu
tionary. Those who did not understand
it did generally not vote, though many
persons adopted the safe rule of "When in
doubt, vote 'No.' "
This year the proposed legislation was
advertised and pretty well discussed. It
proposed no novelties and was generally
not apparently intended for the benefit of
any class. A part of it was plainly con
structive and a part of it was plainly in
tended to remove existing defects or effect
reforms.
The Republican after a careful study of
the propositions recommended the ratifi
cation of all of them except one, the anti
vaccination proposition concerning which,
it offered no recommendation. It was evi
dent that the measure for the restoration
of capital punishment would be adopted
and that has been done overwhelmingly.
The next of most general importance
seemed to us to be the legislative district
ing amendment, but we were doubtful of
its adoption, since it was obvious that it
would increase the republican representa
tion in the legislature. Yet it appears to
have carried easily, even in the strong dem
ocratic counties.
The workmen's compensation act which
we supported, alone, has certainly failed.
We believe yet, as we believed through the
campaign that it was a good measure, but
when its opponents succeeded in convinc
ing the voters that it was a class measure,
its defeat was assured. The almost solid
strength of organized labor was thrown
against it. It could have survived that but
voters generally either opposed it in the be
lief that it was a fight between big employ
ers and their employes, or else they applied
the rule "When in doubt, etc." or else they
did not vote at all.
The very voluminous character of the
propesed amendment precluded an intelli
gent popular discussion of it. It was attack
ed here and there and the weakness, and al
leged inequities aimed at were made to ap
pear characteristic of the whole bill. It will
probably be impossible ever to secure such
an amendment by the initating process.
The restoration of the public contract
system and the repeal of the foolish law
which the prohibition of contracts for pub
lic was a part, did not seem very hopeful.
It was expected that it would have the solid
opposition of organized labor. Perhaps it
did, but it had the support of elements
which on purely political questions were
aligned with organized labor.
A curious thing appears to have hap
pened to the three public land measures.
Two of them amending the statutes with
reference to the sale and'leasing of the state
lands. The third was a proposed statutory
amendment to give effect to the foregoing
measures, if adopted. The two constitu
tional amendments have been adopted by
good margins. They received support in
localities where none was expected. But
the necessary, effective statutory amend
ment is in doubt. It was the last one in the
long list and the voters appear to have
grown weary before reaching it, and either
did not vote or registered their doubt con
cerning it by voting "No."
There appears to have been little oppo
sition to the referred measures, known as
the anti-gaming and the red light abate
ment laws.
In the whole list there were, we suppose,
only two measures on which the people
voted with strong convictions, the capital
punishment and the workmen's compensa
tion acts.

t Fit, fabric and finish the three essentials of all good
clothes are combined in these suits and overcoats in a
manner that closely borders on perfection. They are
made in a thoroughly workman-like manner, of ex
cellent fabrics. Their styles, of course, are smart and
just what well dressed men want.
Clothing costs too much these days to be bought in a
haphazard way. Look around, see where you can do
best. If you do that, you'll eventually come here.
Heavy Weight Suits and
Overcoats for Boys

Mining and Financial News
BY REVIEW
NMV YORK, Nov. 22 In most
e3Jt.;tials today's stock market was
largely a duplicate of the previous
session, prices reacting very gen
erally after an ear.y manifestation
of compartive strength.
Trading was very much broader, but
the occasional intervals o activity
were invariably at the expense of
values. Professionals governed the
day's operations, public or investment
interest being altogether negligible.
The monetary situation occasioned
further restraint, local financial in
stitutions maintaining their attitude
of extreme conservatism, although to
morrow's bank statement is expected
to rectify in part last week's adverse
exhibit.
Post-war conditions were again ap
parent in the heaviness of motors,
coppers and other shares whose
status is likely to undergo, radical
readjustment in the transition to
peace basis.
Metals, secondary motors, utilities
and the fertilizers bore the brunt of
the liquidation at extreme recessions
of 2 to 4 points, Studebaker being
freely sold in the last hour. Reces
sions of 1 to 2 points tn telephone
and telegraph shares were ascribed
to federal control.
Shippings and oils were the sole
features of strength, but those issues
reacted later with rails and United
States Steel, the latter declining 1
points and making feeble recovery.
Sales amounted to 660,000 shares.
Bonds were active, but featureless,
showing only fractional Changes, one
block of $1,700,000 .Liberty fourth
4 Vis sold at 9S. - Total sale, par value,
aggregated $12,500,000. Old regis
tered 4s declined 16 cents on sales.
BRADSTREET'S REVIEW.
NEW YORK, Nov. 22. ISradstreefs
tomorrow will say:
As the country shifts from a war
to a peace basis, irregularity In move
ments, uncertainty about prices, and
cancellations, the latter mostly of
war-wanted products, are strongly
outlined, these manifestations being
accompanied by conservative opti
mism as to the future and readiness
to believe that the country will re
spond to readjustment with a mini
mum of shock. Meantime, however,
new buying in volume is in abeyance,
the general disposition is to mark
time pending the openng of clearly
routes, and in a word, there Is con
siderable looking about to Bee what
the dispensations of peace will bring
forth to fill the gaps caused by the
elimination of war work an aspect
that prominently stands out in the
iron and steel trades. But with the
lifting of numerous restrictions, and
the partial passing of governmental
priorities, many of the arts of peace
breathe easier, and the abrogation of
these disadvantages tends to produce
a degree of what might be termed
cheerful normality. Weekly bank
clearings, 7,075,46S,000.
COTTON MARKET,
NEW YORK, Nov. 22. Cotton
closed at a net decline of 20 to 50
points.
GRAIN MARKET.
CHICAGO, Nov. 22 Prospects of
an increased movement from rural
sources tended today to weaken the
corn market, and so likewise did lib
eral shipments from Argentine. Prices
closed heavy, 2 to Zftc net lower,
with December 1.27 to 1.274 and
January Tr-i-H to 1.2ST-?. Oats fin
ished ft to IVic down and provisions
varying from 30c decline to 37c ad
vance. Bears ruled the corn market right
from the outset. Reports that grain
prices had fallen sharply in London
as well as in Paris and that rations in
Germany had been augmented seemed
to put the bulls on the defensive.
Bearish sentiment, however, became
much more pronounced as indications
accumulated that big forwarding of
corn from first hands was in prospec t.
In this connection , shipper were

Kidney disease is no respecter of
persons. It attacks young and old
alike. In most cases, the victim is
warned of the approaching danger.
Nature fights back. , Headache, indi
gestion, insomnia, lame back, lumba
go, sciatica, rheumatism, pain in the
loins and lower abdomen, difficulty
in urinating, all are indications of
trouble with the kidneys.
When such symptoms appear you
will almost certainly find quick relief
in GOLD MEDAL Haarlem Oil Cap
sules. This famous old remedy has stood
the test for 20u years in helping man
kind to fight off disease. It is import
ed direct from the hune laboratories
in Holland, and may be had at al
most evtry drug store. Your money
promptly refunded if it does not re
lievo you. Be sure to get the genuine
GOLD MEDAL Brand. In sealed pack
ages, three sizes.

oliiciuily advised to get wheat out of
the way as speedily as possible, and
that car permits were now being
issued freely for all grains. It was
announced also that Argentine ship
ments besides being ot considerable
volume included a fair quantity in
this country for account of the food
administration.
Oats declined in sympathy with
corn. In provisions, the strength of
the hog market operated at first as
a stimulus to buying, but was more
than offset later by the downturn of
cereals.

MADE ROUND-UP.
Some six or eteht burros and a
small sorrel mule were rounded up
Thursday night, evidently by some
Mexicans, and driven out of the coun
try. Two of the burros belonged to the
Independent Fuel & Feed Co. and
were taken out of the stables below
the slag dump. The thief also appro
priated a saddle to ride the mule with
and two pack saddles. Officers
throughout the surrounding country
were notified to be on the lookout for
them.
QUAIL ARE SCARCE.
Hunters report that quail, are
scarce' this year when there should
be plenty o them in the foothills
around Bisbee. It is believed that
the Arizona roadrunner, which is pro
tected by the game laws of the state,
is responsible for the scarcity of the
toothsome bird this year, since there
were no rains during the summer to
kill the young or wash away the eggs.
The roadrunner is said to eat the eggs
of the quail and also young ones
whenever he comes upon them, and is
one of the worst enemies the quail

NINE BARRELS OF HOME MADE
WINE SEIZED AFTER ALLEGED
SALE TO SOLDIER BY JIM MAR
KOVICH OF JIGGERVILLE
EARLY LAST NIGHT
Following an alleged sale of a quart
of home made wine to a soldier, 'the
home of John Markovich in Jiggerville
was raided by Sgt. Edward Kelso and
Cpl. Anthony Osterkorn of the provost
guard, assisted by Deputy Sheriff Bil
ly Brakefield. Markovich was placed
under arrest while nine barrels of
what is said to be home made wine
was seized by the officers.
Markovich, who is alleged to have
just completed the sale of the wine
to a soldier as the officers entered,
is said to have made a movement as
though to draw a gun from his pocket.
Sergeant Kelso covered him immedi
ately and the man's hands went up
in the air. Later, it was stated, a
pistol was found on the floor behind
where he had been standing.
Considerable selling of liquor to
soldiers is said to have come to light
in this district recently. This is the
first arrest made here in some time
for that offense. Technically, Marko
vich was taken into custody for viola
tion of the state prohibition law, but
it is probable that the case will be
transferred to the federal officers for
prosecution on the more serious
charges of selling to a soldier in uni
form and conducting a bootleggmg

zone of a military camp.

are complaining that the law protect

pealed since it does more harm than
good. Although it is claimed they are

good they do in killing reptiles. An

TAKE YOUR MASK.
Warren district citizens who con
template making, a trip to either
Tucson or Phoenix are advised to take
along a few "flu" masks. Both citi
zens have put on a strict quarantine
during the past few days and every
one is subject to arrest who does not
wear a mask. The only place Tucson
allows the masks removed is in. the
home of the wearer. Phoenix does
not allow any visitors from the out
side. Officers are patrolling the high
ways leading to that city and stop all
who do not have urgent business in
that city.
Now from the German people comes
the appeal to President Wilson to
save them from starving. As they
have cast out Bloody Bill and his
devil possessed brood, we can com
mence to regard them in a more kind
ly light. No human being should de
sire to see a lot of women and chil
dren starve. We hope some way will
be found to prevent such unhappy
condition.

MACHINE GUN SCHOOL:
FOR FORT HUACHUCA
Orders have been received at dis
trict headquarters from the Southern
department to establish a Machine
Gun school at Fort Huachnca for line
officers of the Arizona district. It
will open not later than Ik'cember 2,
anil last eight weeks, being conducted
on the same lines as the one al Kort
Bliss.
It will be under the supervision of
Col. C. ('. Smith of the Tenth cavalry,
('apt. Francis N. lioucher of the 17th
lavalry being in immediate comnianj.
He will have as assistants tour grad
uates of the Machine Gun school at
Fort P.liss. Attending the school will
be eight student officers from each of
the following regiments: Twenty-fifth
infantry, First cavalry, Tenth cavalry
and Seventeenth cavalry. These offi
cers will be men who expect to re
main in the army.
In issuing the order, Maj. Gsn. I). C.
Cabell, commander of the department,
explains that with demobilization
many officers will have to expect to
be reduced in rank.
FOOD AND PEACE.
The present military situation forms
no adequate reason for relaxation ot
food conservation, Herbert Hoover
has declared in a telegram to Timothy
A. Riordan, federal food administrator
for Arizona. On the contrary, Mr.
Hoover says, European developments
make emphasis upon ths conservation
effort particularly important because
evacuation of the occupied territory
imposes upon this country the respon
sibility of feeding this additional pop
ulation. Even if peace should come quickly,
America will have a big job to tackle,
that of feeding the neutrals as well
as the allies. During the last year it
has been America's task to keep from
starving 120 million people of the na
tions at war with Germany, he said.
"They were kept going, through the
most critical year of the war," it is
pointed out. "After the war they will
continue looking to America for help.
There will be no crops raised over
night. The people of neutral lands
also will clamor for food and will not
be denied. There are 180,000,000
people who are hungry or starving,
victims of Germany and the war.
These are . the people whose lands
have been overruD by the Huns: Po
land, Serbia, Armenia: the people
whose commerce has been destroyed
by the submarine, Norway, Sweden
and Holland; the people whose pro
duction has been sapped by the war,
Rumania and the Ukraine, the Baltic
provinces; the people whose civiliza
tion has collapsed, the Russians of
every territory. All these are needy
and many more will starve unless
help coyes quickly.
"When the war ends, when the bar
riers are raised and shipping what
is left is set free, America will not
be deaf to the entreaties of these
people. Ar.d wo must realize that
war-time economy must continue even
after the coming of peace. Regard
less of when the war ends and that
may be a long way off it is only by
rigid saving, self-denial and by the
practice of the closest economy that
the food supply of the world may be
made to meet the demands upon it.
"This is the conservation program
for the coming year; to provide for
shipment half again as much of the
necessary foods as were exported last
year; while the war lasts to maintain
the health, comfort and courage of
our own soldiers and sailors and the
allies; when the war ends, to rescue
and restore all feeble folks who sit
at a common table.
"And to reach these ends America
must continue to save food."
JAPANESE PRAISE WILSON
(By Review Leased Wire)
OSAKA, Japan, Oct. 5. Comment
ing upon President Wilson's recent
addresses concerning the objects of
the war and the kind of peace which
should emerge from it, the Osaka
Mainichi says: "It is no wonder that
the allied peoples in Europe call
President Wilson 'the spirit of de
mocracy.' He is in a most free and
ideal position in which to dictate
peace terms in this great world war."

TOMBSTONE HAS FOUR DEATHS
IN PAST TWELVE HOURS
WHILE COURTLAND REPORTS
SEVERAL; ANOTHER DOCTOR
NEEDED IN TOMBSTONE
TOMBSTONE, Ariz., Nov. 22.
Tombstone was visited by its first
death toll yesterday from influenza,
when within 12 hours four deaths
were registered here, due to pneu
monia following attacks of influenza.
This morning, Mrs. John Ronchetti.
wife of John KonciieUi, passed away,
following a week's siege of pneu
monia. She had been very low for
the past two days and little hope had
been held out for her recovery, and
this morning the end came. The de
ceased was a Tombstone girl, born
and raised here, "and the daughter of
Mrs. M. Durazo of this tity. Besides
her mother and several brothers and
sisters, she leaves a husband and
three children to mourn her loss.
Last night three other deaths were
recorded, due to pneumonia. Felix
Zepeda, Manuel Savala and a boy
named Juan Alvarez.
Today Dr. Hughart reports in the
neighborhood of 75 cases of influenza,
with considerable number of pneu
monia cases.
Mrs. Tony Giacoma is confined with
an attack of pneumonia, while little
Margaret Andrino, who resides with
her, is ill with iniiuenza.
Miss Nellie Ciochetti, one of the
operators at the telephone office, also
has pneumonia.
The following new cases of influ
enza developed today: C. S. Benson,
Thomas Saundercock and Mrs. W. O.
Wilson, who was a memuer of a party
of tourists going through to Califor
nia and is at the home of Mrs. J. S.
Chambers.
Word from Fairbanks, also under
Dr. Hughart's care, is that there are
a number of new cases of influenza
there, and the situation is becoming
so acute that Dr. Hugiiart. who has
been going night and day, will need
help from the outside, and another
doctor may be necessary here within
the next 24 hours.
The funeral of Mrs. John Ronchetti,
who, died as the result of pneumonia,
will be held tomorrow afternoon at
2:30 from the family residence of up
per Allen street, relatives of the de
ceased having arrived today from oth
er parts of the county. The passing of
iwrs. Ronchetti is a pathetic case,
since she leaves three small children
to mourn her loss, besides a husband
and mother and four brothers and
three bisters. She had been ill just
fqur days with influenza, followed by
pneumonia, which she could not with
stand. Deaths at Courtland
Three deaths were reported this
morning at Courtland. Mrs. John
Haas, wife of the hoisting engineer of
the Leadville Copper company, and
two Mexicans, one a woman. The
body of Mrs. Haas, who succumbed
to pneumonia, was brought to Tomb
stone today, and is at the Porter un
dertaking parlors. The deceased was
a sister of Manuel Ybarra of Tomb
stone, and was a former resident of
this city. The funeral will be held
tomorrow at 3:30, from the residence
of her brother.
