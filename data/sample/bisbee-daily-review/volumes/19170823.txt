the utmost vigor and bravery, the
French took a long series of trenches
uniting Samogneux with Hill 344, after
bloody hand to hand fighting in which
they drove the Germans before them

WASHINGTON, Aug. 22. Japan's
mission to the United States, bearing
a message of congratulation and ap
preciation to President Wilson fi'om
the emperor and people of Japan, was
welcomed to Washington today with
warmth and enthusiasm by the public
and with highest marks of courtesy by
the government.
Welcome Is Warm
Passing through streets ' thronged
with people, past long lines of scLxl
children dressed in white with tfie red
sun of Japan on the fronts of their
gowns, the distinguished visitors were
escorted by cavalry to the residence ol
Perry Belmont, where they will be the
guesta of the governemnt during their
stay. Tomorrow tbey will make the
formal calls which n.uat precede the
btficial conference being arranged for
them and in the evening they will dine

0 lahii Gratified
Viscount Ishii, the special ambas
sador, spoke to the newspaper corres
pondents this evening of his gratifi
cation with the manner in which the
mission has been received, both at San
Francisco and at all stages of the
journey.
Tonight the mission dined informal
ly with the Japanese ambassador.
The mission. It Is authoritatively ex
plained, has n'Jt come here on a com
mercial or political errand, but to greet
the United States as brother nation
fighting for the common end and to
decide after consultation how best th
two nations can co-operate both in an
economic and a military sense, in car
rying on the war. While Viscount
Ishii is vested with plenipotentiary
powers, the questions to be discussed
will not be political, but those of ex
pediency and mutual assistance.
Japanese Shipping
Among the most important problems
to be taken up is that of the disposition
tf Japanese shipping. The entente al
lies are looking to Japan for assist
ance in solving the ocean transporta
tion problem which ranks as first in
Importance in the war. It is under
stood that Japan stands ready to ren

Japan Needs Steel
America becomes an important fac

President Confers With Fed

Coal Dictator May Be Ap

: Passed Laws.
(By Review Leased Wire).
WASHINGTON. Aug. 22. At a
three-hour conference with the
federal trade commission today
President Wilson took up the
whole subject of war prices and went
over in detail the commission's figures
of production costs. Most of the time
was given to a study of the commis
sion's report just completed on the
cost of producing steel.
Coal Industry Handled
Further measures to control tho
coal industry came in for discussion
and it was learned that last night's 'or
der fixing prices for coal for the entire
country would be followed by others
designed to give the government a
complete control of the industry, from
mine to consumer.
The president went to the trade com
mission offices at 3 o'clock and remain
ed until 6. He found Commissioners
Davies and Colver there and the con
ference began.
Details Explained
Before it had gone far the commis
sioners called in Secretary Bracket!
and experts who have handled the cost
accounting work. Toother they ex
plained to the president details of re
ports on coal, steel, t'jpper and other
basic materials, and outlined the work
accomplished in getting production
costs on a number of materials on
which investigations haxe not been
completed. ,
Steel Next in Line
For several days now the president
has given his attention almost entirely
to the work of the trade commission.
Officials with whom he has consulted
are of the opinion that a definite price
policy will be formulated soon. Coal
probably will be finally disposed of
first and steel next.
The trade commission's steel inves
tigation revealed that it will be impos
sible to fix a price for steel as was
done in the case of coal. Varying costs
in different plants make it impractic
able, it is said, to make a flat price and
too. costs are continually changing.
Regulations to Be Fixed
To extend the government's contiOl
over coal, the president has yet to fix
bituminous wholesale and retail prices
and must issue regulations governing
distribution and apportionment as .be
tween different parts of the country.
Anthracite, too, it is understood. r i)
be taken up and prices fixed through
out the Industry. At present anthra
cite prices at the mines are kept don
under a voluntary arrangement reaca
ed some monds ago by the producers
with the federal trade commission,
but no way has been adopted for deal
ing with wholesalers and retailers.
Coal Administration
Extension of coal control will bring
with it, it is understood, the appoint
ment of a coal administrator, whose
relation to the tOal industry will be
about the same as that of Herbert
Hoover to the production and distribu
tion of foods. So far the name Of II.
A. Garfield, president of the Williams
college, is the only man that has been
mentioned for the place.
Coal Operators t) Meet
The executive committee of the na
tional coal operators' association aft
er an all-day meeting here today, rail
ed a meeting of bituminous lOal op
erators at Pittsburg, Pa., for next
Wednesday, to discuss thotr situation.
Operators Complain
Reports tonight - that operators in
some districts were complaining that
the mines cannot be operated at the
prices fixed by the president caused Of
ficials little concern. It was pointed
out that clause in the food control bill
giving the executive the power to fix
prices carries a provision authorizing
the government to take over and ope
rate mines which fail vo adhere to the
prices named or -which decline to
abide by regulations the president may
issue demanding full production.

EAR YPRES ROAD
English Forces Capture Strat
egic Positions lo a Depth of
Near a Third of a Mile.
Struggle Is Desperate.
(By Review Leased Wire.)
LONDON, Au. 22. British troops at
tacking fiercely again today have cap
tured important strategic positions for
a mile along the Ypres-Menin road, to
a depth of nearly a third of a mile
and further to the north carried for
ward their front about a half a mile
over an extent of two and a half miles.
The fighting, according to the offi
cial rep'ort from British headquarters
tonight, was of the most desperate na
ture, the prisoners taken bearing a
small ratio to the losses, including Ger
mans wounded and killed.
The text of the statement reads:
"Successful operations were under
taken by our troops this morning to
the east and northeast tf Ypres for the
capture of a series of strong point
and fortified farms lying a few hun
dred yards in front of our positions
astride the Ypres-Menin road and be
tween the Ypres-Roulers railway and
Langemarck.
"Bitter fighting has taken place at
all points. The enemy again launch
ed repeated counter attacks which suf
fered heavy losses from 'our artillery
and machine gun fire.
"la the neighborhood of the Ypres
eMnin road our line has been advanc
ed to a depth of about 500 yards on a
front of about a mile. Our troops es
tablished themselves in the western
p'ortidS of Inverness copse. Further
nort hour line has been carried for
ward on a front of two and one-half
miles to a greatest depth of more than
half a mile.
"In these operations, we captured
more than 250 prisoners but by reason
of the 'obstacle nature of this wing the
attack took a more than usually small
proportion to the total losses inflicted
on the enemy. The number of prison
ers taken by us in the neighborhood
since the morning tf August 15 amount
to 1378. In the same period we caa
tured 34 machien guns and 21 trench
mortars so far counted."
the southeast 'of Ypres began a dis
tinct local operation near the redoubt
able Inverness copse, which has seen
so much hard fighting recently. Here
also the Germans were making deter
mined resistance. This elevation lo
some extent dominates the British line
to the north and is therefore of great
value to the holders.
The battle of Lens today had dim
inished in intensity to the point of
"comparative calm," due to pure ex
haustion of the Germans, who haCi
been hurled time after time against
the Canadians in fierce attack. No
less than eight heavy assaults were
made against the Canadian position
northwest of the city piVper last night
and in each case the Germans were
thrown back at the point of the bay
onet The Canadians this evening are

British attack against the Germans on
the Langemarck-Freerenborg sector,
northeast of Ypres, has resulted In an

ENTHUSIASM
"Of all the blessed gifts there be."
Says Uncle Hiram Razzum,
"The greatest oX the bunch has he
Who bas Enthusiasm!
"For life is brief and life is swift,
(And observation houry)
Enthusiasm is the gift
That gives it all its glory.
"Enthusiasm leads the way
Along a path that's cheery
It's bright and chipper all the day
And seldom is it weary.
"It seldom knows a grouch or grump.
For sh'ould a care beset it.
It's sure to toss it in the dump
And speedily forget it.
"He stands the worst of life's hard
knocks.
He's full of bounce, he's plastic.
He gathers in the fame and rocks.
Who is enthusiastic.'
The Last Gasp.
"Germany must fight to the last
gasp," remarks Hollweg. v

Freedom's Coming Collapse
"If we permit these aggressions
upon the constitutional rights of citi
zens ... it may easily happen
that our children will not be free peo
ple at all." Editorial excerpt.
The "aggressions" mentioned con
sist largely of tentative measures to
curb the disloyal portion of the pres.s.
Never mind worrying about the free
dom of "our" children. Whose chil
dren will be holding tbem in serfdom?
Not Grateful
President Wil.-Am pardoned a bunch
of suffragettes, probably on the
ground that they were half-baked in
tellectually. At once the beneficiaries planned a
fresh campaign of aggression and fu
tility; showing the executive estimate
to have been right.
Going Some
A young fellow was arrested the
other day rr driving his motorcycle
through a crowd at 62 miles an hour.
It is believed that had he been out
on the open highway he might have
indulged in a spurt of speed.

Old Mother Hubbard (Holland), she went to the cup
board to get her poor daschund a bone; but when ahe
got there the cupboard was bare, the embargo had pinched
this old crone.
Reports from the North sea indicate a dash by the
i
German fleet that has been locked up ever since its "vic
tory" in the Jutland battle more than a year ago. Too
good to be true.
Here is cheering news: Experts have estimated
that the United States can send 100,000 men a month to
France and provision them. We have the ship, say the
wise ones. That means a million Americans on the Flan
ders front within a year. Hurray!
Germany's financial calculations for the war were
based upon receiving huge indemnities from her crushed
foes. What is she going to do If these foes keep on re
fusing to be crushed? Gott in Himmell! what a wail
will go up in the Fatherland when the bill for the war
comes in.
Governor Campbell's report and injunction boiled
down, seems to be, keep on keeping the wobblies out.
but do it legally. Fine! Bisbee is not a stickler for
methods, just so she gets results. All she asks is to
keep the L W. W. out of the district, and that she' is de
termined to do.
. The allies are hammering the Prussian invaders from
Switzerland to the sea. Close observers of the World
War are looking for a German withdrawal on a greater
scale than that of the Somme if this offensive can only
be maintained at its present rate until September. The
plan of the present offensive does not seem to be to gain
ground so much as it does to inflict losses upon the Prus
sians. And it has been successful beyond the highest
expectations. The taking of Hill Seventy, dominating
pens, stirred the Germans to bull-headed fury and they
have sacrificed already many divisions of their best
troops.
It is strange, but true, that newspapers that stand
like a rock for the war and its righteousness, will play
up the piffle and treason of the pacifists in first page
headlines. And these same papers will attack tlie paci
fist bitterly in their editorial columns declaring that they
are affording aid and abetment to the enemies of their
country. Yet these editors are affording aid and abet
ment to the paciifsts, most of whom live for publicity
alone. Censor the pacifists and all their meetings and
mouthings and muddlings, and their activities will evap
orate for want of the publicity steam upon which they
feed, and their harmfulness will be destroyed.
Much has been written of the heroes of the trenches
and of the flying service and of the navy, but what of
the officers and seamen of the merchant ships that sail
the seas in the teeth of the submarines and hidden mines?
Did you know that almost ten thousand of these brave
sailors have been lost on British merchantmen alone singe
the war started? Gracious heavens! what a heavy toll
of death to those engaged in peaceful pursuit.s All the
naval battles of any one war the world has ever known
has not claimed such a death list. The British sailor was
never braver than he is today, and his record of heroism

GOD ALMIGHTY HATES A QUITTER.
(Chicago Tribune)
Mr Hearst has returned to the subject of German
invincibility and American folly. Editorials advocating,
an abandonment of our European allies upon the assump
tion that they were licked began to appear some months
ago in the Hearst publications. They ceased after re
buke. They appear now again.
Why? For the simple reason that Mr. Hearst is a:
war with Great Britain, and the United States is at war
with Germany. Mr. Hearst has not seceded, but he has
quit He is ready for a German peace. He is conducting
a private war with our most powerful ally, and he hopes
to lead as many as possible of his subscribers into it
Mr. Hearst, for reasons good or bad, is in bad with
the British. His news service has been denied the privi
leges of news gathering in British territory.
British control of the news has been neither truth
ful nor tactful, but that is not a cause of war between the
United States and Great Britain. Mr. Hearst has gone
to war with Great Britain. His papers are barred out of
Canada, and a person found with one on his person or
in his possession is liable to severe punishment. Mr.
Hearst consequently is at war with Canada.
He may invade Canada soon and force the Canadians
to eat the Sunday editions of his publications. There may
have been no justification for the order barring the Hearst
publications from Canada, but, just or unjust, it again is
not a cause of war.
He is particularly effective with a class that does not
reason- but imitates. He is teaching this class that the
United States has been betrayed by its government and
that the British have been allowed to use the men of the
United States to gain thei end in a spiteful war with
the Germans.
In doing so he is destroying what loyal Americans
are trying so hard to build up an American morale and
an American understanding of the tremendous issues af
fecting the United States: There are many men who do
not understand why they should be taken from their
homes and from the orderly habits of their lives and sent
to some dirfmal French battlefield to go over the top into
the entanglements of No Man's Land.
Mr. Hearst is telling them there is no reason for this,
and he is telling them that they cannot win if they try it.
Mr. Hearst has quit before the American soldier has be
gun to fight He has thrown up the sponge before his
fighter his the gloves on. He has hoisted the yellow flag
before the red, white and blue has been unfurled.
He attacks the confidence and courage of his fellow
countrymen. He urges them to indecision and grumbling.
He incites them to protests against the reasonable policy
which the government has adopted that of fighting this
war on Mother soil than the soil of the United States.
Whatever Mr. Hearst may think of the Germans, the
British or of Americans, the war is beyond his power to
recall. It is here and must be fought " But Mr. Hearst
has quit And God Almighty hates a quitter.
"Why not a gasolineless day?" asks Cleveland Mof
tett of the Vigalantes. Gasoline is an immensely im
portant necessity of modern war. If every owner of a
motor car would resolve to leave it in the garage at
least one day a week that would mean five million gal-
i
Ions of gasoline savetj for the ambulances, the ammuni
tion trucks, the food trains and the score of other uses
for this precious fluid at the front
The Review has arranged for publication of Walt
Mason's rhymes. No sweeter, gayer, more hopeful, help
ful singer ever chortled his ballads for the public ear
than t!iis fat philosopher and grand good fellow from
Kansas. The editor of the Review has been the friend
and admirer of Walt Mason ever since he drove his spav
ined horse and battered shay to the doors of the William
Allen White's print shop at Emporia and got a job as
telegraph editor of the Gazette. To print his rhymes is
a privilege, just as it is to sow sunbeams and scatter
smiles and speak brave and kindly sentiments to help
the world.
In three months the United States has authorized
the expenditure of 17,000,000,000, subscribed $3,000,000,
000 to a single bond issue and lent $500,000,000 to its
Allies; registered nearly 10,000,000 men of age for ser
vice; gathered in volunteers for army and navy; under
taken and carried into effect the rigid and scientific
training of 30,000 for officers; transported an army of
20,000 or more 3000 mile3 and placed it in France with
out the loss of a man; put a great fleet in active service;
organized food and fuel control, and practically formu
lated a bill to raise nearly $2,000,000,000 in one year by
taxation.
The latest peace movement was futile becaues, as ex
pected, it contained nothing that seriously Interested the
Allies. It however, served the useful purpose of clarify
ing and emphasizing the Allies' intentions. Their terms
are now more definitely and more firmly established, and
the basis of further popular discussion has been clearly
outlined. The Central Power Governments must know,
if their people do not, the mann conditions to which they
must -eventually submit The sooner they abandon the
present policy of self-destruction, the better for them
selves and the world at large. The Allies are united In
insisting upon a peace that means the triumph of de
mocracy over autocracy. At present peace appears im
possible because Germany is not ready to accept the Al
lies' terms, and evidently will not, until compelled either
by an Allied victory or a change of heart in the German
leaders; the latter being much the more desirable ba
sis of adjustment for all concerned, Germany included.

FOREST HILLS, N.- Y., Aug. 22.
Playing true to form throughout the
I'jurth roun dof the national patriotic
singles tournament, eastern and west
ern experts in equal number won
places in the semi-final round to be
contested tomorrow. Although there
was an absence of the upsets whicu
marked the opening round of the play
for the tennis association ambulance
fund, there was at least one surprise
which startled the close followers o:
lawn tennis.
Craig Biddle of Philadelphia forced
R. Liudley Murray of Niagara Falls to
diaw on every 'ounce of his enuurauce
and skill to win a gruelling nve set
matcn. Murray has been favored by
close followers of the game to win the
present tournament and it was thought
ne would have little diuiculty in dis
posing of his Veteran opponent Biaale
surprised and aroused the gallery o.
several thousand spectai'jrs to contin
uous rounds of applause by his aeier
mined stand against his younger rival.

Hams II of Boston and ' Harold A.
inrockn.'orton ot Elizabeth, N. J., was
another five-set battle of thrills which
Williams won, 6-4, 4-6, 6-4, 0-6 6-3.
Throckmorton, after his winter session
of play in the Orient, was not an op
ponent to be trilled with and the score
stood two sets all at the opening ot
tae fifth. Here Williams showed alt
his rornier racquet wizardry, winning
b-3, with an exhibition of servce, tore
aand and backhand drives to the ex
treme limits of the courts, which left
Throckmorton helpless. -
Charles S. Garland of Pittsburg, tne
youngest of the third round survivors,
was eliminated by John R. Strachan
of San Francisco in iour sets at 6-2,
2-6, 6-2, 6-3. Strachan was entirely too
fat and steady for Garland, who hau
previously won a place in the secono
round of the junior championship.
Tue victory of N. W. Niles of Bos
ton over Clarence J. Griffin of 'San
Francisco was even easier. Niles ran
out in straight sets, 6-1, 6-3, 6-0.
The day's play closed with an ex
hibition match between Miss Mary K.
Browne of Sau Francisco and Mis.s
iiolla Bjurstedt of New York in which
the Caliiornian reversed the result ot
the last two matches between thest
women stars by winning, 6-2, 6-4. Miss
Browne was exceedingly last and ac
curate in aer play and scored in rapid
fire order against Miss Bjurstedt, who
appeared unable to get her strokes
working satisfactorily.
: The first round of the junior cham
pionship was also completed and si:,
survivors from various parts of the
country, all in their 'teens, will resume
the struggle tomorrow.

co and later served for three years a
special assistant to attorney general
of the United States engaged in the
prosecution of violators of the neu
trality laws and the Chinese exclusion
act. He is a recognized authority on
the subject of conspiracy to violate
the laws and his views on the status
of the I. W. W. are therefore of more
than ordinary interest.
Discussing the question here yester
day. Major Llewellyn declared with
emphasis that the orRanization known
as the Industrial Workers of the
World is a criminal organization. "It
should be prosecuted," he continued,
"under section 5440 of the federal stat
utes. The prosecution should be con
tinued with vigor until the organiza
tion is broken up and its members
punished.
Section 5440 reads as follows: 'If
two or more persons conspire either to
commit an offense against the United
States, or to defraud the United States
in any manner or for any purpose,
and one or more of such parties do
any act to effect the object of the con
spiracy, all of the parties to such con
spiracy shall be liable to a penalty of
not less than one thousand dollars and
not more than two thousand dollars,
and to imprisonment not more than
two years. Where a person is convict
ed under this statute he can be im
prisoned under the sentence if for
longer than one year to bard labor."
"I am told that the greater number
of the members of this organization
are not American born. I trust that
"this is so, but whether American born
or whatever nationality, they should
be punished and their criminal career
ended. I am like Senator Root, who
gave expression the other day to the
thought that there are traitors walk
ing our streets who should be taken
out and shot, except that I would
make short work of them through the
courts and, if it became necessary to
shoot them as a last resort, there are
untold millions of patriotic citizens to
do the job.
"I believe the Amprican people
have confidence iu our president and
that he will guide the ship of state
safely to anchor, and should it become
necessary, like the immortal Lincoln,
he will even suspend the writ of ha
beas corpus."

Ay concerns have found that providing
StucU'b&kcr Roadsters for their representatives
is a wise and profitable investment.
It increases efficiency because it enables each
man to cover wider territory, see more cus-.

Its handsome, dignified appearance adds to
the prestige of the house.
The Studebaker Roadster is probably the

Last Review for
Its Old Colonel
Saluting as they marched oy in close
formation, the soldiers of the Mrst
Airzona passed in review betore their
old colonel, now brigadier general, A.
M. Tuthill, tor the last time on the
Naco parade gi'ound last evening. It
was an inspiring sight. The band play
ed a march that had a touch of sadness
in its martial strains. Automobiles lin
ed the parade grounds and hundreds
of civilians from Naco and Bisbee
looked on. The sinking sun swept the
plain with crimson streams of light
like a machine gun on the Chemiu des
Dames, and the sky overhead was a
deep and splendid blue.
The spectators clapped and cheered
as each company swept by. Every
detail of the review went through like
clock work from the first whirl of the
baton in the bandmaster's skillful
nands to the last twitch of a driver's
reins over the back of the bay mules
that were galloping by with the last
grub wagon.
General Tuthill will go to Linda Vis
ta, Cal., early next week and the guard
is expecting orders any day, to go to
the same camp. Those wno saw the
last review on the old camp grounds j
will long remember it. And the men '
who marched and the general and of-,
ficers who reviewed them may well i
look back from the pleasant villages
and shell torn trenches of France to;
that last review on the sandy plateau I
under the shoulder of the mountains
on the Naco parade ground.

ed 3,000 yards and held it all, despite
a furious rain of shells.
Troop Demand Advance.
The troops tonight are so pleased
with their great victory that they
demand to be led forward to drive the
Germans further back. The honors of
organizing the successful offensive,
belong, besides to General Petain, to
Generals Fayolle and Guillaumat
RESUME OF WAR.
The offensives of the Italians from
Tolmino to the Adriatic is going on de- j
site stubborn resistance of the Aus-!
trians and the difficulty of terrian.
Meanwhile the British and French
forces in Belgium and on the sector
of Lens and Verdun in France, have
made progress against the Germans
and have held, notwithstanding violent
counter-attacks, all the ground they
won in recent fighting.
Germans In East Active.
On the eastern front near Riga, the
Germans have started what may turn
out to be another big offensive and
also are attacking the Russian lines
in the vicinity of Dvinsk and near
Brody and Tarnopol, in northern East
Galicia.
Italian Very Active.
The Italian offensive has resulted
in the capture of more than 13,000 pris
oners ana tnirty guns ana gains 01
great importance have been made all
along the line. The Italian warships
which are aiding in the attack at the
head of the Gulf of Trieste have
switched their guns from the battle
line and showered shells on Trieste,
the big Austrian port which is the ab
jective of the Italians.
Vienna Admits Defeats.
Admission is made by the Vienna
war office of victories of the Italians
at several points south of Tolmino
end the capture of the town of Selo,
near the head of the Adriatic, but it
is asserted that the offensive, especi
ally at Selo, cost the Italians thous
ands of men killed or wounded, in ad
dition to more than 6.500 prisoners.
Lens Salient Active. J
Not alone have the Canadians re
pulsed all German counter attacks
before Lens, but they have taken ad
ditional positions from the enemy in
front of the important coal center.
Near Ypres the British have pene
trated the German line to a consid
erable depth. On both these sectors
furious fighting is still going on.
German Efforts Futile.
Tuesday night and Wednesday morn
ing the- German crown prince deliver
ed heavy counter-attacks against the
newly-won French positions northwest
of Verdun, where at several points
the Germans succeeded in re-entering
them. These positions, however,
were soon retaken. North and north
west of Verdun the Germans made
similar attempts to re-capture lost
ground, but the artillery and rifle fire
of the Frenchmen forced them to de
sist. More than six thousand Germans
have been made prisoners during the
three days of fighting in the Verdun
region.
On the Aisne front Crown Prince!
William still continues his attacks at
various points along the Chemin des
Dames and adjacent territory but he
has been unable to dent the French
line.
Aerial Raids.
Aerials bombing raids of great inten
sity are being carried out by the Brit
ish and French aviators over German
positions in Belgium and intensive air
fighting also is in progress. Zee
brugge, the German submarine base
in northern Belgium, is reported to
have been heavily bombed again. In
fights in the air the BritiBh Tuesday
accounted for 17 German airships, but
12 of their own machines failed to re
turn to their bases.
Sub Loss Small.
The loss of British shipping by
mines or submarines continues at the
low water mark. Last week only 15
vessels of more than 1,600 tons and
three of less tonnage were sunk.

warned him n'Jt to allow the men to
go on board them.
"I am going to sink them," he said.
French Warship Sighted
Bruce and his men, nevertheless,
took the chance, encountering a
French warship after floating about in
small boats until 6 o'clock that night
The warship took them aboard and
landed them in France. Bruce said he
was told by an officer of the war vessel
that he had a wireless message fiMm
another French vessel saying it had
sunk a German submarine in the vi
cinity of the place the Campana had
been sunk. Bruce said it was only a
matter of conjecture as to whether this
was the submarine that attacked his
ve88el but u he feared that the
Coompana's captain and gunners had
perished.
Prisoners of War
"When Captain Oliver and the other
prisoners went below on the submar
ine,' said Bruce, 'they bade us good
bye and the U-boat captain assured us
that they would be treated as prison
ers of war and landed in a few days
at a German base where the captain
and men n'ould be given every oppor
tunity to get home to their families.
Bluejackets Game
"The bluejackets with us were a
game lot When the last shell had
gone they would have tackled the Ger
mans with their revolvers had the
word been passed to them. It would
have been a useless sacrifice of life,
however, as the Germans had us at
their mercy.
Captain Hated English
"The captain said his instructions
were to take all American gunners and
captains of armed ships prisoners. He
said, however, he was sorry the United
States was in the war because he hat
ed to fight Americans as he had al
ways found them friendly and good
sports. . Americans, he said, will al
ways fight to a finish. He had no u.e
for the French or the English, espe
cially the English.
"The captain said he had been out
a long time and had unk a number of
ships, bnt did not name them. He
told of meeting a fishing vessel which
he thought was English because it was
within the war tone. He fired on her
whereupon the ship hoisted the Span
ish flag. His shots had crippled her,
however, and sbe went down. The U
boat, however, rescued the crew and
placed them on another Spanish ship
the next day. One of the Spaniards
was wounded and the captain said he
treated him with the submarine's sur
gical supplies."
The names of the gunners taken
prisoner were:
James Delaney, chief gunner's mate.
William Millor, seaman.
Fred Jacobs, seaman.
Ray Roop, boatswain's mate, second
class.
Charles Kline, gunner's mate.
Corn Crop Past
Point Where Any
Frost Is Harmful
WASHINGTON. Aug. 22. Most of
tne record-breaking corn crop mill be
past the point where front can damage
it at the average date tf the first kill
ing front, in spite of the fact that the
crop is from 10 to 15 and in places
even 20 days later than the average
at this season of the year in central
and northern districts.
Reports said the Kansas crop was
recovering from the effect of the
drought to a surprising extent, due to
recent rain.
Warmer weather was decidedly fa
vorable for ctorn in all central and east
ern sections during the last week, but
lack of rainfall was felt to some ex
tent from Iowa eastward.
Harvesting of winter wheat was
neary completed Iat week and yields
continued good. Ploughing for next
winter is progressing under very fav
orable conditions in the southwest.
Spring wheat and other grain bar
vesting is making satisfactory progress
to the most northern sections of the
country and is yielding better in
North Dakota and Montana than was
expected.

I PRICE POLICY MAY
BE FIXED VERY
' (By Review Leased Wire.)
GRAIN MARKETS.
CHICAGO, August 22. Corn which
fell away under Belling pressure in the
early trading, had a good recovery
when offerings had been absorbed and
finished well toward top figures, for
the day. The close was steady,
cents to cents net lower, with De
cember at 108 to 108 and May at
106V4 to 106. Wheat finished at 206
for September, the sole option, a de
cline of 4 cents. Oats advanced ,k
cents to cents while provisions fin
ished 1 to 4 cents below closing
prices.
Wheat trading was all In the nature
of evening up transactions, some of
which were hastened by the announce
ment that board of tradebfficials were
expected to take action fixing figures
on which September contracts would
be closed before the government takes
over all handling of wheat In Septem
ber. Oats in early session moved down in
sympathy with corn but moved tip
quickly In narrow limits on cash pur
chases. ,
Discussion of probable embargoes
on meats together with weakness of
live hog prices sent provisions down.
Closing figures, however, .were well
away from the low points.
NEW YORK EXCHANGE.
NEW YORK. August 22. The ac-
' tion of the government In enforcing
reduced prices for soft coal, with the
belief that similar proceedings are to
be instituted in regard to anthricite.
created widespread unsettlement of
the stock exchange today.
Coalers and shares of roads which
derive the greater part of their reve
nue from the transportation of that
commodity reacted sharply, at extreme
declines of 2 to 7 points.
Labor conditions in their bearing on
the shipbuilding situation and reports
of a fresh Teutonic offense against
Russia were among the additional de
velopments used by the bears to de
press values. Trading encompassed
an unusual variety of stocks and many
"stop" orders were uncovered.
Sales were sustained by steels, cop
pers, equipments and many unclassi
fied shares, declines extending from
2 to 5 points.
Indifferent support was shown until
the last hour, when a rally of five
points in Bethlehem Steel caused short
covering in other quarters. The re
covery was of brief duration, however.
Total sales, 770,000 shares.
The money market reflected to an
extent the nervous state of the securi
ties list, call loans ruling at 3 per
cent. Time loans were unchanged.'
Bonds were heavy. Libert 3's sell
ing at 99.88 to 99.96. Total sales, par
value, J2.285.000.
United States bond, old issues, were
unchanged, on call.
NEW YORK, August 22, Liquida
tion continued in today's dealings and
declines were noted In all directions.
It strikes us that the appearance of
the market itself and its recent ac;
tion are enough to convince holders of
stocks that the mechanical position is
not satisfactory and that influential
support Is lacking. Holders are gen
erally realizing that the situation at
present is so complex with respect to
Industrials, and it is better to own as
few as possible of the same.

winter in regard to the fuel situation
will be to produce a sufficient amount
jf coal to meet the minimum require
ments and that the "mining scale be
increased proportionately with the in
creasing cost of the necessaries of
life," President John P. White and
Secretary Treasurer William M. Green
of the United Mine Workers of Amer
ica issued a statement today saying
that the organization is greatly con
cerned as to the effiect the prices fixed
will have on the wage scale of the
miners. The statement continues:
Th torder of the president states
that the scale of prices fixed is sub
ject to reconsideration when the whole
method of mining the fuel supply of
the country shall have been satisfac
torily organized and put into opera
tion. We feel this provision is suffi
ciently elastic to provide a readjust
ment tf prices so tli a tthe mine work
ers may be given a substantial in
crease in the present mining scale,
when it Is taken up for consideration.
"It is the purpose of the miners'
International organization to present
to the governmental agency,- which
shall be named by the president to
administer the price and distribution
of coal, the just claim of the coal min
ers f America for not only a substan
tial by justifiabel increase in the min
ing scale, when the proper time for
such actio narrives. We wish the pub
lic to be furnished coal at a fair and
reasonable price. On the other hand
we insist the mining scale must be in
creased proportionately with the in
creasing cost of the necessaries ol
life."
Ferguson Soon
to Know Fate in
His House Trial
(By Review Leased Wire). '
AUSTIN, Aug. 22. By Saturday at
the latest Governor James E. Fergu-!
son should know whether liv will have
t'j stand trial before the state senate .
on a bill of impeachment presented by I
the house of representatives. Taking j
of testimony on the 13 charges prefer
red by Speaker F. O. Fuller was con
cluded today and tonigth. At 8 o'clock
the committee of the whole met to'
hear the arguments of opposing coun-:
sels. The committee after a two-hour'
J session recessed under the rules until
9 o'clock tomorrow morning when an :
additional six hours of arguments will
be begun.
Counsel on each side has been allot
ted lVnir hours. Following them, mem
bers of the house probably will be al
lowed to speak. While no announce
ment has been made, it is expected
that when voting begins each charge
will be considered separately. This
should, legisaltive leaders say, bring
final action late Friday or some time
Saturday.
Despite the vote of the house com
mittee of 70 to 56 that Ferguson must
tell who loaned him the $156,000 to
pay off bank debts, the governor to
day maintained his silence.

way, are to be supplied with American
steel, there must be an agreement that
the new Japanese tonnage is to be de
voted to war uses.
Freight Rates
An important secondary considera
tion is that of freight rates, and it
remains to be seen whether Japanese
ship owners can be induced to content
themselves with more moderate pro
fits than they have been making, the
ships conforming to scale of ocean
rates which the allies and the United
States are expected to establish.
Enlarge Naval Work
Another war measure which the
commission is expected to discuss will
be the enlargement of Japanese naval
activities. Already Japan has been of
great service to her allies in relieving
them wholly of the heavy task of pa
trolling the seas in the Far East. It
has been suggested that Japanese na
val activities might extend to include
patrol of the whole north Pacific from
shore to shore, thus releasing the Am
erican naval forces In those waters for
service in European and other waters.

Invaders Engaged'
Ten enemy airships of the Gotba
type were attacked by naval airplanes
in the vicinity of Ramsgate between
2 and 11 o'clock this morning. The
enemy machines, which were flying at
a height of between 11,000 and 12,000
feet, were closely engaged, and in ad
dition to the two mentioned by Lord
French in the earlier communication
another was shot down by a royal na
tal air squadron. The remaining sev
en returned seaward followed by num
erous aircraft.
The following report has been re
ceived from the vice admiral at Dover
relative to the action taken by the
royal navy air squadron at Dunkirk:
"Several flights of machines were
sent up to intercept enemy craft from
entering England. One flight of three
machines met 12 Gothas 35 miles north
of Nleuport and engaged them, chasing
them toward Beebrugge, but with no
decisive result.
"Another of our patrols of ten ma
chines engaged a flight of about 25
enemy escorting scouts, which were off
the coast awaiting the return of the
enemy bombers and in the ensuing
fight five enemy aircraft was sent
down completely out of control. All ;
of our machines returned safely." j

OM
SHAVING
. Whoever first started the shaving
idea probably knew very little about
hair. He made a great mistake when
he didn't read up more on hair. If
he had really made a study of hair he
would never have invented the first
shave.
He didn't know that hair would grow
out again.
The man who invented shaves had
no idea that more than one would be
necessary. When his wriskers appear
ed again he was astonished. His wife
was puzzled and mentioned it to her
neighbors. Other husbands tried it
and sure enough all of their wriskers
grew out again. The custom was soon
widespread.
The world is now used to the phen
omena and the growth of whiskers no
longer excites wonder. The man who
shave today knows that he will have
to shave again soon though he tiOes
not know why. 'e cannot understand
the inscrutable laws of nature.
There was a day when a man could
hold down a good job on the strength
of a long beard alone. Five feet of
whiskers then Ould keep him in poll
tics for years. Solomon had no more
wives nor wisdom than he had whis
kers. If a man could have one big shave
that would last for several years a
shave would not be such a nuisance.
As it is life is full of lots of little
shaves and so little is gained by theiu
after all.

The District Exemption Board at !
Tucson has begun its work and will
be in session for a number of flays. A
large number of claims have been ap -
pealed to them from the local boards
in all of the counties In the Southern
District. The Cochise county claims
v.ere m best shape and were gone ov-i
er by the board on Tuesday but no ac-1

"Scores of claims had been filed be
fore the district board and were in
archives ready for action. Most of
the claims were those of ranchers
growing beans who wanted a little
time to harvest and then they would
be ready. A number had appealed
from the action of the local board
and a charge of direct prejudice was
;.:ade against the Tombstone board by
one claimant who was very bitter.
"From Cochise county, Jacob Clay
ton Bates said if he was taken his
nine years' work in paying off his
tanch would be lost. He is at Yuma.
L. T. Barnett of Courtland said he was
raising beans.

had offered the services of his plant.

"Fred Lambert Jr., of Lowell had ap
plied to the local board at Tombstone
for exemption because of dependant
wife and expected child. He thought
ine local ooara was prejudiced against
Mm for according to Lambert it had
exempted other with less claim to ex
emption. He was one of two married
men whose claims were rejected out
of the first lot of 1.S0O. He accused
the local board of trying to inveigle
his father-in-law into signing an affl-
davit that he would take care of the
dependent wife and the coming child
so the board could charge l-ambert
with perjury. They also alleged that
the wife had an estate whereas accord
ing to Lambert the estate was not set
tled and when It was. he had no as
surance that his wife would get
enough to live. His father-in-law had
a number of children under fifteen
years old and was not
