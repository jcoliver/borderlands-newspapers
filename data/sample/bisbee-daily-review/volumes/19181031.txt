UNDATED WAR LEAD, (By
the Associated Press.) Over a.,
front of, some 60 miles from the
Brenta fiver in northern Italy to
the vicinity of the Adriatic sea,
the Austro-Hungarians are being
violently attacked by Italian, Bri
tish, French and American troops.
In the mountain region the en
emy is resisting desperately and
holding his ground fairly well.
But east of the Piave river he
is in flight across the plains of
Treviso, shaping his course over
the same territory through which
he drove the Italians a year ago
and reached the eastern edge of
the plains of Venetia.
Already numerous towns have been
liberated, 33,000 prisoners have been
taken and large numbers of guns and
machine guns and huge quantities of
stores have fallen into hands of the
allied troopB. Far behind the lines al
lied aviators are heavily bombing en
emy columns in dense masses which
are in retreat over the badly congest
ed roads leading eastward toward the
Austrian frontier.
Judging the situation from the rapid
advance the allies are making it
would appear that the entire enemy
front has been broken east of the
Piave and that with the cavalry oper
ating far in advance of the foot troops
the enemy forces will be unable to
reform their battle line until the Au
strian border is reached. It is not un
likely that many of the Austro-Hungarians
are doomed to capture or ex
termination by the allies.
On the western front in France and
Belgium there has been a marked di
minution in the intensity of the in
fantry activity. Along the British
line there have been only patrol en
counters and recipocal bombardments.
The French have, however, are en
gaged in another attack on a front
of about seven and a half miles be
. tween St Quentin-Iepetit and Herpy,
in the general direction of the en
emy's communication lines running
eastward from the old St. Quentin and
La on sectors and also with the pur
pose cf driving a wedge into this
part of the southern battle line and
thereby compel the enemy to readjust
his front through Champagne to the
Meuse.

LONDON, Oct 30. That im

government as part of armistice
terms is expected here. Sir
George Cave, home secretary, an
nounced in the house of commons
yesterday the same- conditions im
posed on Bulgaria would be in
sisted on in any truce with Ger
many or Austria and Gen. Allenby
has been instructed to follow the
same policy with the Turks.
There is plenty of evidence that
British prisoners have received worse
treatment throughout the war than
others, except Russian.
Snch a demand will be a very im
portant factor and it is not likely that
ths other allies will show less regard
for their nationals who are suffering
in German camps.
Events since German peace over
tures began have not tended to instil
in the British hearts a spirit of con;
ciliation, forgiveness or leniency to
ward the enemy.
Sinking of the Lelnster followed
closely the German note; evacuation
of Belgium and French towns, for
years under German rule, has opened
what has heretofore been largely a
sealed book of rumors, and authentic
stories from truthful people about
German barbarism toward inhabitants
have been flooding out.
Finally yesterday's discussions in
the house of commons of tne treat
ment of British prisoners appeared
to have been about the last straw,
breaking the back of British patlencf
patience which the country gener
ally seni 8 now to thiifk has been car
ried much too far. The Germans have
only themselves to blame that these
revelations came at a time so. un
fortunate for German interests.
The topic was forced on the house
by a strong public demand for light on
the circumstances of what it terms

WASHINGTON, bit. 30.--et refary
Lane and Redfield today authorized
statements of why they bslieved the
country should return a democratic
congress next week.
Secretary Lane said:
"At the head of our state is the
man whom' the world looks to for
guidance in this contest. To back
him to the limit and enable him to
look the kaiser in the eye and tell
him what the conscience of the world
commands is our duty irrespective of
party. He must not be discredited,
weakened or worried by any apparent
hesitation on the part of the people
to generously support him.
"The kaiser knows he is a demo
crat, and those who have been loyal
to him as the exponent of the na
tion's will should be sent to congress
that they may prosecute the war and
lead in the great period of reconstruc
tion that is to follow a period in
which larger consideration must be
given to the needs and rights of those
who suffer the handicap of poverty
or ignorance than ever before. . . .
The democratic party should and must
take the lead in the evolution of a
more intensely socialized life. It ha
the right symptoms and It has tho
sympathetic and balanced leader
ship." Secretary Redfield said.
"Ordinary common sense shows
that the interest of the country re
quires the election of a congress (both
bouses) in political sympathy with
the administration. One does not
swap horses white crossing the stream
save in an emergency. No emergency
calling for the swap exists. The pres
ent team Is well matched, pulling to
gether and doing the Job well. One
cannot say how the new horses would
behave. Let it be admitted for the
sake of argument, that he has offi
cially pulled fairly straight much, per
haps most, of the time thus far.
There are exceptions and" often a vis
ible tendency to kick over the traces.
. . . Under our party system It is
normal that the republicans should
seek In advance a basis on which to
found their campaign of 1920. Such
a basis they hope to find, they can
only find, by pecking at the admin
istration between iiow and then. It
is certain, therefore, that the election

his promise was unfulfilled. Men
were put to work within range

Sir George said that in the

many as had Bulgaria, but happily
the suffering of the captives there
was over and they were being
brought out of the country.

Railway communications were be

it might be of -military advantage to
do so.
On the other hand the enemy has

DECLARATION OF
AMERICANISM
(Issued Last April)
I stand by the President.
There is no issue but the war.
There must be no catering to traitors. j
I detest the I. W. W. and their doctrines.
The people of the United States are waging this war.
. I am not in sympathy with the strike breeder and agi
tator. I am not in sympathy with the profiteer.
The logical method of adjusting labor differences is arbi
tration. We should punish purveyors of enemy propaganda and
advocates of sabotage as felons.
Every able bodied mart should be compelled by law to
work at some useful calling.
We must run down and stamp out the enemy within
our gates and crush his ally, the 1. W. W.

NEW YOHK. Oct. 30. John D.
itcciieieller, chairman of the execu
tive committee of the United War
Work campaign, which On November
11 will start a drive to raise $170,
500,000 lor welfare of American
troops announced today that the com
mittee would accept only "indirectly"
money raised by the nation-wide box
ing carnivals being arranged by James
W. Coffroth, national supervisor of
the boxing section of the sports di
vision of the campaign. This deci
sion, according to Mr. Rockcteller, fol-iowf-d
protests received from minis
ters throughout the country, who had
criticized boxing as "brutal. '
Mr. Rockefeller also announced that
the executive committee had adopted
a resolution settln? forth tht money
raised by any sporting events held on
Sunday would be refused.
Since plans for the campaign wer?
first trnnounced, boxers and boxing
promoters have been arranging, under
the direction of Mr. Coffroth, carni
vals to be held in various cities
Throughout the country. It was as
serted that by this means many thou
sands of dollars would be ' added to
the fund
The action of the executive commit
tee means that the country-wide pro
gram-of boxing will have to be can-
cell sd unless the boxing promoters
decide to conduct the carnivals in
dependently of the United War Work
campaign and then turn over the re
ceipts.

in Germany, the Frankford Zeitung
says:
"In broad circles of the German peo
ple it is made quite clear the people

radical change in the home and for

quences from those changes, especial
ly for his own sake."
The newspaper considers Emperor
William's strong religious nature as a
guarantee of his good intentions in
Germany's past policy, and it acquits
him of having planned the great war,
but it adds that he has made himself
a "symbol of the old regime.

dignation at Count Andrassy, the Au-stro-Hungarian
foreign minister, mak
ing an offer to President Wilson tJ
negotiate a separate peace, without
consulting the German government or
the representatives of German execu
tive committees. In the reichstag the
dispatch adds Count Andrassy's action
caused dismay and anger it being de
clared it was not necessary as the
situation was assuming a form under
which co-operation with Germany
would be possible.
The wireless also says that advices
from Budapest were to the effect that
on instructions of the Hungarian gov
ernment the governor surrendered
Fiume out of consideration of the
small number of Croatian troops there
and that the town council was dis
solved and all the authorities ceased
their functions. The dispatch adds
that the fate ot Fiume will be decid

official circles as to probable features
of the armistice which will be offered
to the central powers, but it is ad
mitted there is no definite knowledge
cn the subject. m
One comparatively new, propositi
relatss to guarantees to be exacted
from Germany for repayment of tre
mendous financial losses suffered by
populations of those portions of Bel
gium and France occupied by German
troops. This is understood to con
template possession by entente pow
ers of important industrial cities in
the Rhine country and of products of
mines and soils therein until com
pensation has been made. Thus Ger
many would be dependent on entente
powers for any iron and coal of manu
factured products she might have to
draw from that territory.
The olticial text of the Austrian
note which did not differ materially
from the unoliicial version, was made
public today at the state department,
but there was no announcement of
receipt of the communication from
Count Andrassy to Secretary Lansing
asking his good offices with the pres
ident in behalf of Austria's plea.
Nor anyone would admit knowledge or
the communication from M. Tchitche
rin, the Bolshevik! foreign minister,
as given in cable dispatches today,
demanding evacuation by allied and
American troops of the Mourman,
Archangel and Siberia. As the state
department has never recognized ex
istence of the government of which
M. Tchiterin is a part, it is not prob
able hi3 note will elicit a response.
It is regarded as natural that the German-supported
Bolshevlki government
should have been made very nervous
by the imp?nding collapse of the mili

"In reply to the note of tie presi

government dated October IS,
of this year, and about decision of the
president to take up, with Austro-Hungary
separately, the question ot armis

government has the honor to declare
that it adheres both to the previous
declarations of the president and his
opinion of the rights of the peoples

the Czecho slovaks and the Jugo-Slavs
continued in his last note. Austria
Hungary having thereby accepted all
the conditions which the president
had put upon entering into negotia

peace, nothing, in the opinion ot the
Austro-Hungarian government longer
stands in the way ot besieging those

government therefore declares itselt
ready to enter, without waiting for
the outcome of other negotiations into
negotiations for a peace betweeu Austro-Hungary
and the entente states
and for an immediate armistice on all
the fronts of Austro-Hungary and begs
the president. Mr. Wilson, to take
the necessary measures to that ef

Democratic leaders were understood
to he prepared to forestall another
outbreak of partisan debate by mak
ing a point of no quorum.- it v. as
conceded by republican members that
the democratic plans could be car
ried out, thus forcing an adjournment
of the senate from (lay to day.
Introduction of resolutions bearing
on proposals of the central powers is
expected tomorrow, but in view of the
power passessed by either party to
force an adjournment no discussion
of the resolutions is expected. '
Because of the situation in the sen

age tomoriow of an election recess
resolution, causing a continuation of
the existing three day recess schedule.

Courtrai
In the great war many cities, famou3 in
old times, have become famous again this
day. Ypres, Lille, Lens, Amiens, Cambrai,
St. Quentin, Laon, Verdun, Rheims, all
along the battle line their lights of glory
shine on the pages of today and we turn
back in the great book and lock closely to
see the radiance reflected about them from
the long ago. But not one of these cities
has more to boast about in the matter of
glory and of momentous events that oc
curred before their walls than has Courtrai,
that ancient city of Flanders, taken by the
British the ether day. There had been no
fighting before Courtrai, no waiting or
hoping or longing for her redemption from
the Hun. She was far from the battle line.
There are no endless rows of wooden
crosses before her walls, and in the night
winds that blow across her fields can be
heard no sighing of any army of ghosts of
the men who fought and died that she
might be free. Not in this war. But in
wars gone by many men have died for
and against Courtrai, and the ghosts of men
dead for five hundred years haunt her
streets and fields. .
Before the ramparts of Courtrai over
five hundred 3'ears ago "was fought the
most remarkable battle of democracy
against autocracy in all the history of the
world. Here the common citizens of
Ghent and Bruges, on foot and with pike
and axe, defended the town against the on
slaught of the knights and nobles and the
proudest chivalry of old France, and when
the day was done these plebian footmen
celebrated in old Courtrai their victory over
the patrician horsemen and princes of the
French king. Forty thousand Flemish
burghers fought against an equal number of
the French at Courtrai in the year 1 302,
and the day after the battles these workers
and weavers and winegrowers gathered up
three thousand golden spurs from the heels
of dead knights on the battle field. Many
historians referred to this fight as the bat
tle of the Spurs. ,
At another period Charles the Rash, the
proud, reckless, brave and glorious Duke of
Burgundy, rode with a picked band of fol
lowers against Courtrai, and these same
burghers laid down their hammers and their
yardsticks and picked up theii trustv pikes
and went forth to meet him. And Charles
the Rash fell in that fight and his body
was found next day in a shallow, frozen
pond, with a ring of Kis dead knights and
men-at-arms about him. No gayer, more
gallant or glorious figure ever made his
war horse caracole across history's page
than Charles the Rash. Born to the pur
ple, bred in arms, vainglorious, handsome,
dashing, princely, brave to rashness, as his
name implied, he was the type incarnate of
the patrician and autocrat of his day and
age. His generals tried in vain to dissuade
him from leading his small band against
those massed pikes that guarded Courtrai.
but his invincible pride would brook no
opposition of mere citizens against his
princely pennons, and he rode to his death,
as debonnair Vind dauntless' a knight as
ever couched a lance or whirled a sword
in the lists of war.
But the men of Burges and of Ghent
cared net for hi3 beauty or his fame or his
skill or hii fiery courage or his silver
mounted armor. They set their p-kes and
hamstrung his horse and hacked him with
their axes and left his corpse in the sedges
of a pond where it froze in the sheeted ice
of a winter night in Flanders, as mean and
as melancholy a shroud as ever encased
the form of a darling of fame and for
tune and princely rank.
Yes, Courtrai has had her battles. She
has always siood a bulwark of democracy
against the princes. Her citizens have
never quailed before the power of kings.
And now she is free again from the con
quest of might over self government. Her
cathedrals and halls and spires are most
of them more than 600 years old, and her
history date3 tack to the time of the Roman
conquest of Gaul, but if these towers stand
another six hundred years and her history
dates forward twice as many j'ears as it
does backward, never again will Courtrai
citizens have to fight for their lives and
their liberties against the kings and princes
of this earth. Kingship is as dead today
as Charles the Rash, duke of Burgundy,
whose body was found frozen in ice in a
pond before Courtrai five hundred years
ago.
The fifteenth point respectfully pre
sented as an addition to President Wilson's
original fourteen THE BAYONET!
Oranges are retailing at twelve and one
half cents apiece in Chicago and the Windy
City has declared a blacklist on this high
priced fruit and is eating Florida 'grape
fruit at ten cents per.
France remembers only too well the con
ditions imposed by Germany when her vic
torious legions surrounded Paris and de
manded the surrender of the French arm-
ies in 1870, and France will insist upon
these same conditions now for Berlin. It is
true that the allies have not yet surrounded
Berlin, but patience. Wait a little while
and we shall see the Tommies and the Poilu
and the Yanks before the Brandenburg
gate.
Tucson Citizen: President Wilson has
3ent a telegram to Carl Hayden endorsing
his loyalty. As far as we know HaydenJs
loyalty has never been questioned but he
had been criticised because his war record
is bad and he voted against the draft and
denounced this great measure in scathing
terms. Does the president approve of Hay
den's ve'e against the draft? He does not
say so.
Germany has always practiced a most glad
and glorious frankness with her allies. For
instance, when the French penetrated into
Bulgaria they found plenty of intelligent
Bulgarian officers and civilians who in
sisted that Paris had been taken by the Hun
and that London was in a state of seige;
They were positive, these Bulgarians, that
Germany had never lost a battle in the
west; they had the assurance of the Ger
man imperial government for it.
"We want the allies to insure us our
rights," now wails the duchy of Luxem
burg. But what rights has Luxemburg in
the premises? She made no protest when
the Germans violated her territory to stab
France in the back. Her duchess is in love
with that blackguard, Rupprecht, prince
and general of German hosts. For four
years she has been contented and safe and
shamed and satisfied on the side of the win
ner. New, when the tide turns and the al
lied rivers of steel flow towards her bor
ders, she prates of her rights. If she has
wrongs, let her turn to Potsdam to have
them righted. Surely her good friend and
protector, the Hun, will incline his ear to
listen to the justice of her appeal.
The first germ having been sown, a
brood of notes are now propagated and fly
on their own wings from Germany to these
shores. Austria, too, is sending them. L.et
us pray that the next and only reply to
all. .these Prussian subterfuges be pro
nounced ty Foch himself, in the terms and
details of the surrender. It is certain that
Foch will demand Metz and Strassburg on
the south and most likely Ccblenz and Co
logne on the north, and certainly Heligo
land, and the surrender, as well as the with
drawal of certain ships and armies.
And woe to the allied civil leaders or the
politician who dares to censure or oppose or
even disagree with those terms of Foch.
The allied commander in chief must not be
interfered with or his power curtailed in the
least by the political leaders in the matter
of the armistice. Germany is sure to whine
and appeal to Wilson for more just and
merciful terms. But the world knows that
when this same German stood before Paris
he insisted on complete surrender, and then
he would not grant peace until France had
given up Alsace and Lorraine and a billion
in indemnity and allowed German troops
to parade in triumph through Paris. If
Foch wishes to tear a page from von
Molke's notebook and insist upon an allied
parade through the Brandenburg gate into
Berlin, can any German, with his own ex
ample of 1 870 before him on history's page
make any logical or honest objection or
plead extenuating circumstances or lack of
precedent!
Political Gossip
PHOENIX. Ariz., Oct. 31 That Tom
Campbell will Lo elected governor of
Arizona by a majority of 5000 is the
prediction of Judge Albert M. Sanies,
republican state chairman, who has
just returned from a tour which took
him into every county in Arizona.
Judge Sanies found that in every coun
ty the old Hunt and anti-Hunt lines
1 have been closely drawn and that it is
generally understood that Fred Colter
i is the Hunt candidate. Judge Sanies
believes that 7500 democrats in Arizo
na will vote for Tom Campbell this
year because they believe he was
counted out when justly elected and
because of their desire to smash the
Hunt .machine.
Will Carry Cochise
Judge Sanies who lives at Doug
las, predicts that Tom Campbell will
carry Cochise county and that he will
get a larger majority in Maricopa
county than he received two years ago
when that county went over the top
Yith 3194. .He also believes that Colter
will lose his home county of Apache.

PEACE SONG THAT DIDN'T REACH THE ALLIES' HEART
Colter.
A CHURCHMAN'S
ZEAL AND ARDOUR
Toe day the kaiser's request for an
armistice wes received a member an
nounced the fact in the Methodist con
ference in Los Angeles, and added the
remark. "Is it not glorious?" Like
a flush the bishop was on his feet and
exclaimed, "It is perilous!" The con
ference responded with a' roar of apj
plause with hand nnd voice. The
bishop continued amidst continuous
applause: "We are in danger of los
ing til for which we have been fight
ing. We are fighting (or peace,- batted
on righteousness and founded on the
eternal principles and ideals of the
democracy of Jesus Christ. Any other I
ground of peace imperils all the sacri
fices of men and money we have
made." He held the lapel of his coat
with a service pin with tto stars and
continuing, said: "You and I have
given our boys and God only knows
what it means to me, but rather than
have a peace which will not be endur
ing and world wide, we shall complete
our sacrifice. Hear what Isaiah the
Prophet says: 'The wicked are like
the troublous sea when it cannot rest,
whose waters cast up mire and dirt'
That is what the kaiser offers now.
'The fruit of righteousness shall be
peace and the effect of righteousness
quietness and assurance forever.' "

THE FLU
When your back is broke and your

And your shin bones knock and your
tongue is furred.
And your tonsils squeak and your hair
gets dry, .
And you're doggone sure that you're
going to die.
But you're skeered you won't and
afraid you will,
Just drag to bed and have your chill.
And pray the Lord to see you through.
For you've got the Flu, boy.
You've got the Flu.
When your toes curl up and your belt
goes flat.
And you're twice as mean as b
Thomas cat.
And life is a long and distnal curse.
And your food all tastes like a hard
boiled hearse;,
Wh.?n youP lattice aches and your
head's a buzz,
And nothing is as It ever was.
Here are my sad regrets to you
You've got the Flu, boy.
You've got the Flu.
What is it like, this Spanish Flu?
Ask me brother, tor I've been through,
It is by Misery out of Despair;
It pulls your teeth and curls your
h;ir;
It thins your blood and brays your
bones.
And fills your craw with moans and
groans.
And sometimes, maybe, you get well.
Some call it Flu I calHt hell!

The Terrible Pains in Back and

so bad with my back that when I stooped

per cent on the common stock and
1 3-4 per cent on the preferred were
voted as usual.
The- reduction in the "extra" divi
dend was doubtless impelled by the
further enormous appropriation of
$101, 987,347 for account of federal
income and war excess profits taxes,
as disclosed by the quarterly report.
This exceeds the appropriation of the
previous quarter by slightly more
than $11,000,000.
In the three-quarters of the calen
dar year the steel corporation has
charged off to this item the'vast sum
of $224,288,795, these charges rang

Total earnings, exclusive of the in
come and profits taxes, amounted to
$144.94S,936, which is less by about
$8,325,000 than the high record at

Analysis of the statement issued to
day shows a steady decline of earn

If your skin is yellow complexion pallid

- Dr. Edwards' Olive Tablets a substitute
for calomel were prepared by Dr.Edwards
after 17 years of study with his patients.
Dr. Edwards' Olive Tablets are a purely
vegetable compound mixed with olive oil.
You will know them by their olive color.
To have a clear, pink skin, bright eyes,
no pimples, a feeling ot buoyancy like
childhood days you must get at the cause.
Dr. Edwards' Olive Tablets act on the

no dangerous after effects. g

Hi
Some things are so simple that they
have to be explained again- and again.
When things are obvious,: people keep
looking for mysteries behind them.
So it is with the packing business. The
mere size of Swift & Company confuses
many. Eecause their imaginations are
not geared up to scale, they believe there
must be magic in it somewhere some
weird power.
Swift & Company is just like any
other manufacturing business, run by
human beings like yourself; it takes in
raw material on the one hand and turns
out a finished prcauct on the other.
Swift Ik Company keeps down the
"spread1', or the exr,enc absorbed between
raw and nnished n: cvljria!, to as low a
figure n3 posr:l-.:.': ( didn't it woul'4
be put out cf I .::: :.::: by others who do.)
Kow much Svirt Zl Company pays for the raw
material, and her umch it gets for the finished pro
duct, depends upon cenditions vhich Swift & Company
does not control.
It depends entirely vzcx hov much people want
the finished product, and how much ray material
there is available to make it from.
The profits of Swift & Company amount to less
than one cent per pound on all meats and by-products,
less than one-fourth of a cent cn beer.

N.V YORK, Oct. 30. Influenced
i.:u.:;iy by further indications of a
I (.out. a?tion of credits and the reduc
tion In the initea mates steel extra
tuv:.iund lrom 3 to 2 per cent, the
stock market today experienced a
drastic liquidating movement with
severe Impairment of quoted values.
Declines in the general list, after
some early fullness in rails, ship
pings and coppers, ranged from 3 to
15 points, oils leading the collapse
Just as they had featured the ad
vance of recent weeks.
The bulk cf the selling, much of
which wns clearly of an enforced char
acter, with a liberal sprinkling of
bearish pressure, again centered
around United States Steel, that stock
furnishing about 25 per cent of the
total turnover.
Mexican Petroleum, which Is in,
disfavor with the authorities of the
exchange because of its spectacular
performances, opened at a decline of
9Mt points, rallied 6 and in the broader
selling of the last hour reacted 14
points, showing a loss of 31 points in
two days.
Even the high grade rails and ship
pities, metal? and representative spe
cialties broke sharply with speculative
issues i.i the final hour, when sup
port seemed almost wholly lacking
weakness prevailing at the end. Sales
amounted to 975,000 shares.
Bonds were inclined to ease, but
held better than storks, showing no
marked weakness. Liberty SVfes made
a slight gain, but that group as a
whole, was relatively inactive. Total
sales, parvahie, aggregated $7,650,000.
Old Urited States bonds were un
changed on call.
GRAIN MARKET.
CHICAG. Oct. 30. Corn rapidly
declined in value today under liquida
tlon, due for the most part to the new
German and Austrian notes received
at wasmngton. 1'rices closed nerv
ous, 32 to 5!4 net lower, with No
vember 117?g to ln-'i and December
114 to 115. . Oats finished 1 to
1 down, and provisions off 2a cents
o $1.37.
Unloading by scattersd holders de
pressed the corn market throughout
the day, and about tiie only demand
of Importance came from shorts. Re
ports touching the diplomatic and
military outlook nearly monopolized
attention and were interpreted by the
great majority of traders as of de
cided bearish insignificance. Ite
act that month end adjustment of
trades was in progress tended in a
general way to deprive the market of
support, and so, too, did a forecast
of good weather for the rest of the
week. Besides, late in the session,
advices were current that the United
States was far behind Its schedule on
wheat exports, and (hat there wat
practically no vessel-room obtainable
for corn. .
Oats gave way with corn. Export
ers were still out of the market and
domestic demand was slow.
Weakuess in the hog market, as
well as in grain, caused provisions to
tumble. Pork, especially made a
sharp descent.

CAMPBELL SAYS
EIS
EXCELLENT ONE
Republican Candidate fcr
Governor in Interview De
clares Peculiar Apathy Cov
ets Political Field
"This campaign probably i3 the
most peculiar in the history of Ari
zona," said Thomas E. Campbell, re
publican caudidate for governor, yes
terday. The combined efiect of the
i absence of political meetings, on uc
! count of the influeazaepidemic, cou-
pled with tha ' after etfecis of the
! fourth Liberty loan campaign, has de
veloped a peculiar apathy, politically i
speaking, among the people as a j
whole. However, as nearly as I can i
judge, Underlying that apathy I have
discovered ft. condition which at once
surprises and delights me. My chance
in Cochise county, as nearly as I can
judge, is fully as good if not better,
than two years ago.
"It is qdite a handicap to be unabla
to hold meetings at which you can
meet voters face to face and tell them
your intentions, hopes and aspirations,
but every candidate find3 himself in
tho same position. We are shaking
hands with as many of our old friends
as we cau. meeting aa many new peo
ple as conditions will permit of nr.d
letting it go at that."
Mr. Campbell, Mr. Matthews, and
Mr Compton, after spending the morn

A PROCLAMATION.
The Fourth Liberty loan for six bil
lion dollars has gor.e. over the top
within the time set by the govern
ment, and Arizona, as usual, was in
the list of those states which raisad
their full quota. The annual interest
on those bonds will bo approximately
two hundred and iilty million dollar. !
Coincidentaliy, the national fire loss
lor oi.e year approximates that same :
amount and if it were possible to I
eliminate that loss, the annual Inter-1
i-st on the Tourth Liberty loan could
be saved for the nation While, ot j
..ou.se, it i3 impossible to eliminate
ihat entii-e loss, it is tnio that much
.f it couid te eliminated.

The state of Arizona has an imper

ballot is confusing and has caused

all committeemen, regardless of party,;
icsyuuaiuic 6L-.im6 uui uic .ua-a.
The parties are put to great expense
in mailing instructions to voters, and
even then, hundreds of ballots are 1
scratched and in consequence thrown j
out at every big election. The Hunt- i
Campbell contest, for example, was
aue largely xo a misumiersianuins oi
the ballot by the people.

Party Men Nevertheless
Now Judge Baker's name does .not
appear in the democratic column of
the ballot, his name appears at the
top of the nallot toeether with that
of A. Morrison, socialist nominee.
Each cf these parties has a column
to itself below thase names. At the j
head of each column is a square, with
the inscription, "vote straight ticket 1
hero." !
If a voter wishes to split hi3 ticket ;
among the three parties he must not
1 put his cross in either one of the three
squares, but mjst put separate crosses
after the candidates of his choice in
the several columns, if he intends to
split his ticket. In thaf event he must
' not put a cross in the square.

TO THE VOTERS
A report that I am using my present
office as deputy Ccited States mar
shal to evade mititary duty is being
circulated throughout Cochise county
with a view to affecting my candidacy
at tha coming election. That this Is
a lie pure and simple can be proved
by communicating with my superior
at Phoenix. I have twice offered my
self for military service and on each
occasion these o.'fers have been re
jected. I am not trying to sneak or beg my
way iato the sheriffs office, and re
quest that the voters give my candi
dacy impartial investigation and not
take for granted any rumors that may
be circulated between now and No
vember 5.
