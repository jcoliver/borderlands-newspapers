From Reveille and Opening Salute of 21 Guns at 7 A. M.
Until Close of DanGing and Boxing Bcuts Last Eve,
Visiting Thousands Are Kept on the Move;
Capt. Harding Tributes U. S. Fighters
From the Wowing of Reveille and a
salute of 21 guns which aroused holi
day 6leepers yesterday morning: at 7
o'clock, until the late dancing last ev
ening at Warren park, the people of
the Warren district were entertained
with a varied program which kept the
crowds busy figuring on the quickest
time from one event to the other.
A large crowd gathered along the
line of march to witness the parade
In the morning, then the athletic ev
ent at Lowell and Bisbee kept the
children busy and the grown ups
amused with their antics.
The ball game In the afternoon at
Warren park drew probably the larg
est crowd of the day with a goodly
number of soldiers who came up from
Douglas to participate In the celebra
tion here. The manouvers by the 10th
Cavalry at Vista park was an Interest
ing spectacle, with a reminder of the
wild west days, and last but not least,
were the boxing matches at the ball
grounds, which were witnessed by a
record crowd.
J. R. Henderson, chairman of the
celebration committee, was kept busy
all day as well as J. C. Ryan and Geo.
13. Winfrey, who had charge of tfce
arrangements for the boxing matches.
,tpf. J- B- Potter had hv hands full
the l c?ys- oa gins. e xario
members of the sub-committees all did
excellent work and deserve the com
mendation of the community for the
success of the day's celebration.
Capt. Victor J. Harding, an attorney
from Phoenix who acted as orator of
the day, entertained a large crowd at
the Phelps Dodge Mercantile store
steps near the postoffice with one of
the moat eloquent speeches ever made
in Bisbee, and one made by a man
who saw much service at the front.
It was what the people wanted to
hear, some picturing of the incideats
of the dash and spirit of the Amer
ican soldier at the front. He gave a
most earnest and eloquent statement
of what he believed to be the senti
ment of the returned soldier, their
desires for a clean government, vital
patriotism and true Americanism
which will infuse a new spirit into our
natioaal life.

THDUSANDSVIEWPARADETHRDUGH
WARREN DISTRICT: SPORT WINKERS
The celebration of yesterday was
one that will be long remembered by
the people of the Warren district. The
parade formed at 10 o'clock and there
was a long line of spectators all the
way from Bisbee to Lowell, where the
parade broke up. Nothing happened to
mar the perfect. arrangement of the
parade and everyone felt satisfied that
those who were responsible for the
event had done everything la their
power to make this occasion one fit
ting for the celebration of the first
Fourth after the war.
Col. George B. White of the Tenth
Calalry wired Washington and secured
permission for the discharged service
men to lead the parade, which was
very satisfaqtory to the men and those
who felt that they should have the
first place of honor.
Service Men Lead
The C. & A. band the procession
with the ex-service men following In
a column of squads, the two auto
loads of the men who were unable to

tions of traffic continually passing,
but the people were interested not
only in what he had to say but his
earnest personality and his ability as
a speaker.
He said that no matter how much
anp man who went through the flght
Ijg might enter Into the celebration
of the Fourth his heart must turn at
times to the comrades he had lost,
to the brave men who went down in
the fight.
He spoke of an Incident Regarding
a pal of his who was an attorney
from Wisconsin and who was wound
ed through the abdomen in an attack
oa a strong German position across
a wheatfield concealing a machine
gun nest. After making the sixth as
sault his friend was found where he
had crawled off the stretcher and was
shot through the head. He had, evi
dently, after being seriously wounded
crawled out in the sixth attack and
had been killed.
Tells How U. S. Won War
He reminded his audience very forc
ibly of the conditions a year ago when
the German drive was at its height
and our ports were in danger. The
Americans went into the fight and In
fused new life and spirit into the tired
allied soldiers' -and made the stand
c?pcd the tavi. j'nding
the death knell to autocracy.
Praise for Allied Fighters
He told of the ability of the Amer
ican soldiers in the great emergency,
praising the French, English, Austra
lian and Canadian forces, but says
that the best soldier of all was the
busk private in the line of the Amer
ican army.
Another Interesting incident was re
lated of a Kentucky mountaineer who
could not even sign his name on the
pay roll and being called before the
captain was asked his age. The boy
replied that he was 17 and was 16
when he enlisted but gave his age as
19 to the recruiting officer. He ask
ed the boy why he enlisted and got
the reply: "Well, I heard the Germans
were killing babies over here and I
thought it was about time I was get

STORY OF BATTLE, BLOW BY BLOtli
ROUND ONE
Wlllard loomed up like a Goliath
against his five-inch shorter David,
and opened the engagement by pump
ing his long left twice into Dempsey's
face with force enough to make the
latter blink. The chalTenger missed
a swing and slipping Into a clinch
ianded three body blows with his left
land, carrying but little force. Wil
lard held him easily in a clinch and
partly turning him around, used his
rapier like left again, once to the
head and once to the body after the
break.
Dempsey Opens Up Artillery
Then Dempsey, as If he had got
the range, opened his heavy artillery
and swung a Jarring left to the Jaw,
followed by a right and left to the
body. The almost superhuman power
of the punches was immediately ap
parent. A partly silly, partly stupid
expression overspread the cham
pion's face and as he rocked on his
heels his whole body quivered. He
pulled himself together and as Demp
sey crowded in again, shot a left to
the mouth which he repeated to the
eye. The blows did not even cause
his youthful nemesis to hesitate and
dodging past the out-tsretched left
as It snapped for the third time, he
whipped over a right and left almost
simultaneously, the blows landing
flush on Willard's jaw, and for the
first time in his championship career
Willard was dropped to the floor. He
was up again at the count of six only
to ne sent to the canvas with another
right. As he rose slowly to his feet,
the blood began to pour from his
mouth.
Willard Down at Bell
He turned away from his opponent
who struck again twice with his right.
Willard falling on his hands and
knees. When he arose Dempsey
crowded him into a corner and with
a right and left to the face sent him
to the floor again. As he arose a
fusillade of body blows dropped him
in a corner where he sat when the
bell terminated the round and led
Dempsey to believe that Willard had
been counted out.
ROUND TWO
Dempsey started where he left off
and Willard, with a big cut under his
eye, appeared to be in a bad way.
He managed to snap a left to Dump-

sey's face and a puny right uppercut
to the chin. Dempsey replied with
several body drives and AVillard fell!
partly throug the ropes. When he
regained his feet he stumbled into a
clinch but Dempsey easily tore loose
and proceeded to batter him almost
at will, the champion retaliating with
but three feeble stabs to the face;
during the melee. When Willard!
went to his corner he fell heavily in-j
to his chair and it was seen that his I
right eye was completely closed and1
that one side of his face was swol
len entirely out of shape, while
Dempsey was unmarked.
ROUND THREE
The final session was simply a se
ries of rapid fire swings which fell
on Willard's face and body with pile,
driving power which left big Jess
completely helpless a3 he staggered
about the ring and wobbled along the
ropes utterly unable to defend him
self. I.iood bubbled from 'his mouth
with every blow and spectators at
the ringside began to yell to Referee
Pecord to stop it. Just as the bell
rang and Willard collapsed In his
chair he spat out a tooth and it was
seen that he was in bad condition.
Willard Consents to Quit
As he sat lolling from side to side
his chief second, Walter Monahan,
talked earnestly to him and when
Willard nodded his head Monahan
walked over and spoke to Pecord.
The referee threw up his hands and
hurried to Dempsey's corner. He ges
ticulated In the uproar and finally
pulled Dempsey toward the center of
the ring before the new champion
realized that Willard's seconds had
thrown up the sponge. As soon as
he grasped the situation; he started
for Willard's corner and the late title
holder arose and stepped weakly to
meet him. They shook hands. Wil
lard muttered something in reply to
Dempsey's remarks, and the fight
had passed into history.
BEST MAN WON, SAYS JEFF
BT'RBANK. Cailf.. July 4 "It was:
simply the case of the best man win-j

SALT LAKE CITY, July 4.
Mrs. Celia Dempsey, mother of
the new world's heavyweight
champion, is the proudest woman
in the entire country tonight.
"I have felt all along that Jack
would win," she said. "I am just
filled with joy and pride. I guess
if he hadn't won I would have

now I am a mighty proud moth

TOLEDO. July 4. There Is one
woman In Toledo tonight happy be
cause Jess Willard is no longer
world's heavyweight champion. She
is the wife of the vanquished title
holder, and mother of his five chil
dren. She left them at their home
in Lawrence, Kans.. came to Toledo
unannounced last night, and, with
Willard's attorney, occupied a seat in'
the $50 section this afternoon while
her husband was being battered to
defeat. No one in the huge crowd,
except the champion himself, knew
she was there.
When the bruised and battered
giant of the ring was brought to the
home he had occupied in Toledo's ex
cluisve residential district, Mrs. Wil
lard was there, eager to care for his
wounds. She put him on a daven
port and sat at his side, applying
soothing iced cloths to his "closed
eye.
Mrs. Willard left the sunbaked
arena after the towel was cast into
the ring ,-at the start of th fourth
round, while the beaten champion
was taken to the Casino, his train

bathed and first aid given his In

BI TERRIFIC DEMPSEY PUNCHES
Floored Five Times and Saved While on Canvas by Gong
. At End of First Round, Giant Jess Staggers Dazedly
Through Two More Rounds Before His Seconds
Mercifully Put End to His Punishment
TOLEDO, July 4. By virtue of one
one of the speediest and most one
sided battles which ever decided a big
fistic even. Jack Dempsey, who may
now wish to be known by his full vot
ing name of William Harrison Demp
sey, today became the world's cham
pion heavyweight boxer.
To all intents and purposes he whip
ped the huge Jess Willard, favorite in
the meagre betting, in one round.
Dempsey thought the referee had an
nounced him winner and actually left
the ring, but he was called back and
the butchery continued for two rounds
more, when Jess, sitting in his corner
with a bewildered look on his swollen
countenance, failed to respond to the
gong for the fourth round.
"It was no use to continue," said the
ex-champion; "my strength went from
me in the first round."
Willard Most Surprised Man
He sat there, apparently the most
surprised man in the United States at
the moment His right eye was clos
ed and his right cheek swollen and
blue with bruises. Blood covered his
body and his arms hung so helplessly
over the ropes' that it seemed as if a
child might give him further abuse
without arousing his interest.
Dempsey was breathing hard when
the fight ended, but it was from exer
tion and not from punishment. He
escaped almost unhurt, but as he had
been using his arms like trip hammers
on the anatomy of his opponent for
nine crowded minutes in a sun that
sent the tromometer to 110 degrees,
his heart was still pumping at hieh
pressure and he appreciated the
breathing spell.
Hits Too Fast for Experts to Count
In the first few seconds of the con
test it looked as if the expert who
had been assigned to keep detailed
count of all blows struck might
come measurably close , to doing so,
but it was only for a fraction of a
moment. After that the experts did
well to count Jack's blows, let alone
take-note of how each was made. The
challenger knocked the big fellow
down five tibes in the first round and
had him hanging helplessly on the
ropes or draped over his- own shoul
ders most of the time when he was
not taking advantage of the count.
The crowd thought the fight was
REVIEW SCORES WITH BULLETIN
- SERVICE; IS FIRST WITH NEWS
OF WILLARD-DEMPSEY CONTEST
Again the superiority of The Associated Press wire service, com
bined with the enterprise of the Review, has been demonstrated to the
Warren district. That the residents of the district already appreciate
this unbeatable combination, was demonstrated yesterday afternoon
when, with rain threatening, and with Fourth of July celebration fea
tures taking place simultaneously in all parts of the district, a crowd of
more than 500 Willard or Dempsey fans stood in front of the Review
office for more than an hour, receiving from the Review a color pic
ture of the battle scene in Toledo as the crowd filed Into ths arena
there, and a full description of the historic heavyweight championship
battle, blow by blow, from the time the boxers entered the ring until
Willard's seconds tossed up the sponge at the end of the third round.
To say that The Associated Press invariably leads is almost a plat
itude, but just how well it was leading yesterday afternoon, and how
well the Review handled Its service, perhaDS few In the huge throng
in front of the Review office realized. During a great part of the con
test the Review was megaphoning from its front windows the blows of
the fighters WITHIN TWENTY SECONDS of the time they were ac
tually struck, and the final flash "Dempsey wins" was given the Re
view crowd within less than a minute of the time the crowd In the To
ledo arena knew it, in spite of the Immense confusion prevailing at the
ringside at the time. No other service made a record even remotely
comparable with this.
After the end of the battle, hundreds, perhaps thousands, le?r-fd
the news first from the bulletin boards In front of the Review office,
where a full description of the fight was published. The Review hn-i -
large staff employed to carry the news hot off the wire from its t'-.
craph room to the bulletin board, almost as rapidly as it was beiri
shouted through the window by Allie Howe, formerly of the Review ?
itorial department, who volunteered his services for the occan'on, dih
whose stentorian lung-power and distinct enunciation through tre giant
meg ?o hone made a big hit with the crowd.
The Review and the Associated Pressan unbeatable combination,
always first with the news.
over in that round. Willard was down
for the fifth time and the count was
apparently about to end when the
gong sounded.. It was a modest gong
which could not make itself heard,
so many people, and even Dempsey,
didnt' get It. He crawled through the
the ropes and headed out onto the
shoulders of screaming fans when the
truth was broken to him aifu he was
hauled back. Such fighting as the
Kansas ranchman produced was plac
ed on exhibition at the onset. He had
stood in his corner a picture of confi
dence. His smile seemed that of one
who had a brief and not unpleasant
J task before him. He certainly was all
set to go, for just before time was
called he was heard to remark, "Let's
get this thing over."
Dempsey Thoughtful Before Bout ,
He measured the attendahce. which
disappointed estimates by about 50
per cent, with an appraising eye.
Dempsey presented a contrat. None
of the confidence of his training camp
statements appeared in his bearing.
The man across from him outweighed
him forty pounds and looked as big
and impregnable as a metropolitan
bank building. The mood of the chal
lenger was plainly thoughtful and
more than one ringside gazor whis
pered, "he's licked right now."
Shout "Stop Itl It's Murder!"
When they were introduced Jess
sauntered over with the cordial man
ner of one desiring to reassure a
youngster, and took his hand in th
friendliest way. Jack' handshake was
friendly, too just then, but it was the
Inst token of friendship from those
gloves. A minute or so later they
were usina: Willard for a cnopplng
block and some in the crowd were cry
ing, "stop it! stop it!' it's plain mur
der." Dempsey's first effective blows,
and the ones which apparently settled
Willard's fate, were a ritht over Jess
shoulder to the jaw, a left to the body
snd a rieht to the jaw. Jess stag
gered. His eye was closed and he
reked. and the challenger, with all
the energy of his puking youth, be
gan hitting him at will.
Attendance Below Expectations
The attendance was below expecta
tions. Seats were built for 80,000.

tContlnued from Paeb One)
and the estimate was -that not more
than half of these were occupied.
Speculators lost heavily. No betting
was reported at the ringside, nor was
there much elsewhere so far as could
be ascertained.
The heat of the day was terrific, in
tensified as it was by the vast acreage
of green lumber. During the prelimi
nary bouts, which lasted from 11
o'clock till 2:30, the thermometer
jumped to 120 degrees. It Bhowed 110
degrees when Willard and Dempsey
entered the ring.
Wild Scramble in Ring i
When Dempsey was proclaimed win
ner the crowd surged onto the mat in
a wild scramble to shake the hand of
the new champion. At times tome of
them toppled over onto the telegraph
ers and erporters Just below who were
struggling in the mad disorder to re
port what had happened. Police even
tually dispossed them by hustling
Dempsey away.
Willard was taken to an automobile
and disappeared from view of the
crowd.
While the passing of the heavy-
I weight championship was one of the
most dramatic events of modern ring
history, it was lacking entirely in high
class boxing. With the exception of
the first three snappy left jaos witn
which Willard opened the contest ,the
mentary comeback in the second,
which for a few seconds led to the
belief among his supporters that he
would weather the storm and cardy
the battle along on even terms for a
few sessions. It was the last flicker
of a spirit which was stronger than
the flesh. Another sweeping right arm
smash that flew over Willard's shoul
der and landed flush on his bleeding
jaw, took the last ounce of resistance
out of the giant and made his down
fall a matter of but minutes.
New Champ Shows Nothing
An analysis of the new champion
shows nothing new in his fighting
methods. He fore into his opponent
at top speed, as has always been his
fighting custom, and simply battered
his way to the pinnacle of pugilism by
the speed of his blows and the over
whelming power that traveled from
the huge shoulder muscles down
through the brawny arms and into
the clinched fists covered with five
ounce gloves. He made little or no at
tempt at defensive work and not more
than five or six times during the nine
minutes of battling did he resort to
foot work to avoid Willard.
' Dempsey First in Ring
Dempsey appeared in the ring at
3:55 o'clock and Willard a minute
later. They were stripped ready for
action, Willard wearing short, tight-

OIL COMPANY

that all offerings of GILBERT-TRUE will be advanced
on JULY 10TH from $1.50 a share to $2.00 a share. -

WHAT GILBERT-TRUE
OIL CO. OFFERS
This Company capitalized for $150,000 offers three
wonderful money making opportunities in the oil busi
ness. THEIR FIVE ACRES in Northwest Burkburnett not only
adjoins the TEXAS CHIEF, but this 5 acres is known as
the TEXAS CHIEF OFFSET. That is, the property to
be an offset must be within 300 feet of the TEXAS
JHIEF well itself. This five acres is now being drilled
under contract for the GILBERT-TRUE COMPANY
according to our latest advices and is worth in our
estimation the entire capitalization of the GILBERT
TRUE OIL COMPANY the TEXAS CHIEF is the big
pest well in Burkburnett field and the TEXAS CHIEF
OFFSET well or the GILBERT-TRUE well should be
the SECOND BIGGEST WELL IN THE FIELD.
THE SETTLED PRODUCTION owned by the GILBERT
TRUE of 100 barrels a day amounts to over $6,000
a month or $75,000 a year this warrants the
dividend which the company is paying.
THE ROYALTY OWNED by the GILBERT-TRUE COM
PANY on the NORWOOD WELL and tract is another
valuable asset. The NORWOOD first well is producing
over 7,000 barrels daily. The entire tract consists of
750 acres and the TEXAS COMPANY is under contract
to drill ONE WELL FOR EVERY TEN ACRES. They
have nine wells now drilling with two on the sand. This
royalty alone should in a short time pay at least 100
per cent to stockholders yeariy.
GILBERT-TRUE OIL is the "wonder" stock on the
market today and should be bought while the oppor
tunity at $1 .50 is available. '

. Enthusiastic Bisbee fans and fan
ettes to the number of 4000 "witnessed
34 rounds of the fastest milling ever
seen in the state last evening at
Warren baseball park.
Long before the scheduled starting
time the bleachers and grandstand
was filled to overflowing at the call
of time there was not a vacant seat
in the park and hundreds stood on
the side lines.
All of Bouts Spectacular
Prom the tap of the gong of the
curtain raisers till the last round of
tne mam pout each exhibition "was
filled with spectacular fighting and
surprises that gave every one pres
ent more than their money's worth.
The huge crowd and the clean-cut
features of the boxing game proves
conclusively that the other fights, it
of the same high standard, will draw
to capacity in Bisbee.
Referee McDonald, boxing instruc
tor of the El Paso high school, of
ficiated throughout the program and
his decisions were fair and met with
the approval of alL Mr. McDonald
knows the game from every angle
and permitted nothing but clean
sportsmanship throughout.
The curtain raiser, a four-round go
between Bhomer Zumsteg, age 12
years, and his brother, Tiny Zumsteg,

lor the main events to follow. The
little chaps weighing 65 and 54
pounds respectively hammered each

rounds. Zumsteg, Sr., declared the
bout a draw and met with a shout of
approval from the crowd. True
science was used by each of the min
eture pugilists and the flooring of
the larger of the two several times
gave the crowd a thrill.
Gradi Panned for Tactics
Next on the program came Johnnie

He was cautioned in this round by
Referee McDonald to cut It out and
watch his step. The second round
JradI continued to hit below the belt
and floored Hughes who took the
count of five before rising. The
crowd panned Gradi, who was again
cautioned by Referees McDonald. The
third round Gradi persisted in dirty
tportsmanship and after hitting
Hughes three direct fouls in succes
sion Referee McDonald awarded the
decision to Hughes. Gradi's" tactics
did not meet with the .favor of the
fans, and the panning he received was
well meted Out to him. '
. Greeves and Lundy Make Hit
"Kid. Lundy of San Francisco and
Johnnie Greeves of El Paso next
stepped into the ring for a six-round
milling, contest The weight of the
contestants was 123 pounds and 124
pounds respectively. From the first
round on the superior scenic of
Creeves was plainly -visible and it
was only a question of whether
Lundy's greater ring experience could
save him. ' Greeves was awarded
rounds three and four by the referee
on his superior showing. Lundy's
heavier weight was the principal
reason for his salvation from the K.
O. route. In the final round Lundy
hit Greeves in the chest on the break
by the referee which is equivalent to
fouling and was ruled out, which
eared him from Greeves' final
punches. Creeves was awarded the
decision. Lundy's good nature and
sameness made a hit with the crowd
and taken all In all this match was
next -to the main bout, .the best one
on the echedule. Greeves, who is a
protege of Burns, Is but 20 years of
age and looks like a comer.

EXCELLENT BOUTS
from the 1st TJ. S. cavalry, disposed
of his opponent, Johnny McCullough
of Bisbee, weight 148 pounds, via the
K. O. route. Chambers, confident
and cool from the opening exchange
of blows, worked like a well oiled
machine. The tap of the bell was
an tnrit saved JMccuiiougn from a
knock out in the first round. Twice
in the first round he was compelled
to take full advantage up to the
count of eight before getting on his
feet. The second round Chambers
Jumped from his corner and McCul-
lough's eye was opened by a wicked
left upper-cut from Chambers. The
sight of blood seemed to have both a
paralyzing and worrying effect on
McCullough. Chambers then started
in with Bhort arm jabs and swings
and to end McCullough's misery ad
ministered the knock out blow with
a swing to the right temple which
knocked McCullough into slumber
Chambers showed superior ring gen
eralship throughout and was by far
the cleverest fighter of the two. The
fans were unanimous In - their opin
ion that a more experienced fighter
matched against Chambers would be
worth going miles to see. It is hoped
that such a bout can be arranged for
the amusement of the Bisbee fans.
Main Bout Full of Action
The main bout between Bobbie
Burns, boxing Instructor of the south
ern department for the U. S. army,
weight 120 pounds, and Ralph Lincoln
of Los Angeles, weight 119 pounds,
which went the full ten rounds, was
resplendant with thrills and not a mo
ment from the start to the finish did
any fan fail to see real action, clever
ness and science displayed by both
boys. Lincoln, one of the quickest
boxers in his movements ever seen in
action, together with perfect physical
condition, shows that he is a- comer,
and will be heard from in the feather
weight division in the next few years.
He is a hard nut for any boxer to
crack, cool and hard hitting, and with
finely developed Infighting tactics
which he used on every occasion, plus
the fact that he has youth on his side
made him in his f'ght last night a fav
orite with the crowd.
Burns' Generalship Counts.
Burns, who is popular with all the
local and southern fans, was given a
big hand on his entrance into the ring.
Burns showed that he was- not in the
best of condition,-carrying too much
weight which was a handicap. Burns,
y.no is tne veteran or many nard
fought ring battles, having been fight -
infr cinoa 1 Q 1 i ia nna - f V nlfnnnnt- i
and cleverest fighters in the ring to
day. His superior ring generalship
saved him at several critical times
from Lincoln's rushes and rain of
blows. His opponent also had the' ad
vantage of youth. Bobby Is nearing !
the 35 mark and his opponent is still
in his early twenties. Burns' own
style of ducking vicious blows by his
opponent , was clever. The fight by
rounds follows:
ROUND ONE
Lincoln rushes Burns to the ropes,
in the clinches both fighters ex
changed body blows. Lincoln hits low
and is cautioned by the referee. A
right to the jaw by Burns brings back
a haymaker from Lincoln, Burns
ducks and the bell rings. Round one
declared a draw. '
ROUND TWO
Lincoln swings several uppercuts
only one of which lands. Frequent
clinches and rushes to the ropes by
each man wa3 the" mam feature of
this round. Burns' cleverness in duck
ing swings brought forth cheers from
the crowd. Round two , declared a
draw.
ROUND THREE
Burns had a shade the best of it In
this round although officially it was
pronounced a draw. Burns continual
ly rushed-Lincoln to the ropes and in
the clinches rapped several hard ones
home above Lincoln's heart. Lincoln
breathing' heavily -and - the - fighters
were milling in the center of the ring
when the bell sounded. "
' ROUND FOUR ' - '
Lincoln from the crack of the bell
was showering Burns with blows many
of which Burns ducked and sidestep
ped. Linceln rushed Burns to the rope.
A right to the temple and several
short jabs in the 6i'de made Burns
drop his guard for, the. fraction of a
second. Lincoln seeing his opening
rained a stream of left uppercuts on
Burns' Jafr. Burns completely groggy

did not want to be heroes but want to
be leaders in civilian life in time of
peace the same as they had been
while in the army on the front line,
believing that patriotism and un
swerving loyalty to the flag was the
guiding principle of life.
Almighty Cod ha raised up a new
nation in the west that will stand op
pression to the last man, a people
who went to the rescue of the Euro
pean nations and drove the Huns back
from the realization of their dreams,
said the speaker.
This spirit, he added, will survive
the war and will lead the people in
the true light in time of peace and
the American soldier will have no
small part in this new ideal.
The address by Captain Harding
was one- which met the hearty ap
proval of his audience as a sound ex
position of the right and true ideals of
true Americans.
Reading Is Eloquent
The reading of the Declaration of
Independence was presented yester
day in a jtnost interesting manner and
in a very pleasing style by Mrs! Gil
bert Maston. With her interpretation
of this masterpiece of American liter
ature the audience gained a different
conception of its meaning and many
remarks of appreciation could be
heard at the close of its reading.
for several moments covered the best
he could until the haze cleared away.
This round was all Lincoln's, it looked
for a time as though Burns was des
tined for the K. O. route.
ROUND FIVE
Burns crafty ring generalship stood
him in good stead, still weak and puff
ing hard from the punishment of the
previous round, (Lincoln was the ag
gressor continually rushing Burns and
fighting him hard in the clinches.
Burns was worried by the open glove
tactics and rope punishments. Lin
coln's round.
ROUND SIX
This round was a draw. Burns seem
ed to have a shade the best of it.
Clinching and rushing to the ropes
seemed to be the favorite tactics of
both. Lincoln continually fanned the
air at the place where Burns had been
when he started the blow. Round six
a draw.
ROUND SEVEN
Round seven was a tame affair, both
fighters apparently holding back, re-
i serving their strength for an expected
opening up from his opponent. Clinch
ing and feinting for openings although
action was mixed with it. Round sev
en a draw.
ROUND EIGHT
Lincoln, hitting hard and continual
ly shifting and Burns ducking and
clinching'. Lincoln administered Be
verf Punihment, to Burns on the rope
1 Uouco.
Lincoln's round.
ROUND NINE
Lincoln's round again. Burns seem
ed to have lost his steam and breath
ing heavily, although still covering on
the rushes and evading the swings
made by Lincoln. Burns -at moments
forced the fighting but Lincoln seem
ed the better of the two.
ROUND TEN
Lincoln opens up anjjld cut over
Burns' left eye, the steady stream of
blood handicapped Burns as tht blood
put one eye practically out of com
mission. Lincoln followed up his ad
vantage by body punches to the left
side and jaw. Burns unable to cover
as formerly. Lincoln outfought him
in thi3 round. Burns was game and
continually fought back with blows
over Lincoln's heart. The tap of the
gong found both fighters breathing
heavy. Referee McDonald held up
Lincoln's hand and the yells of the
crowd showed that the decision met
with favor from the majority.
Burns and Lincoln put up a fight
such as i3 seldom seen anywhere.
Both boys deserve credit for the ex
hibition and the fact that they fought
continuously and hard.

The department emphasized that

regarded as to meat, especially beef
and wheat products. Faced by the
largest wheat crop on record and with
many cattle raised in response to the
demand for meat production for the
army now maturing, the Americaa

department believes, is more strict

WORLD PEACE
CELEBRATED II
U. S. CAPITAL
WASHINGTON. July 4. Return of
world peace was the dominating
spirit cf Washington's celebration oh
Independence Day. Pageantry in
which the clls of industry and other
civilian occupations to returning sol
diers and sailors were displayed, and
-a parade in which all of the nations
arrayed against Germany and Austria
were represented, were the features
of the observance.
Seven pageants were given late in
the day on the lawns of department
and other public buildings. These
pantomimes were merged into a great
pagtant entitled the "offering ot
peae," which showed the peoples of
the world having passed through the
horrors of war, returning with cour
age and anticipation to the pursuits
of peace.
Embassies and legations of all the
allied and associated governments
had floats in the parade which moved
down Pennsylvania avenue from the
White House to the capitol. The
newly formed nations of Czecho-Slo.
vakia, Poland, Lithuania and of the
Serbs, Croats and Slovenes, were rep
resented. The South American re
publics especially were prominent.
Members ofhe cabinet, other high
government officials and thousands
of citizens tonight heard a chorus ot
several thousand voices sing national
patriotic songs to the accompainment
of the United States Marine band on
the steps of the capitol.
Early In the day Secretary Paker
and Admiral William Stlnson, chief
of naval operations, acting for Sec
retary Daniels, presented service med
als on behalf of the District of Colum
bia to residents of the district who
Berved with the colors during the
war. Besides soldiers, sailors and
marines, those receiving the medals
included the battalion of yeowomen
and the battalion of "marinetttes.".
Presentation of the medals was fol
lowed by the administration of oath
of service and citizenship to 51 young
men and 61 young women, represent
ing the states of the union and the
three territories. The oath, admin
istration of which Secretary of the v
Interior Lane desires to make in the
future a nation-wide feature of the
celebration of Independence Day, was
as follows: t.t
"I enter into American citizenship
with this pledge made before my fel
low citizens: that the rights and
powers given me by this country
shall be used that the people of
America- shall the more perfectly en
joy the benefits of free institutions
and increasingly present to the world

HEALTH AND SLEEP
RESTFUL, SLEEP makes for good digestion and straight
thinking.
And straight thinking and good digestion maWfe for rest
ful sleep the cycle to good health i3 complete,
in other words, the proper performance of one bodliy function
aids in the perfection of other bodily functions.
All or us sleep, but rot all of U3 sleep restfully.
We all know that some of us with very active mental and phys
ical lives, arise after six hours sleep fully rested and rtady for
another strenuous day.
We also know thai others of us arise after eight and even ten
hours sleep more tired than when we went to bed. There has been
sleep in both cass, but the latter has not been restful sleep.
Broadly tpeaking, there are two sides to the human mind.
One is the reasoning side.
The other isfthe visualizing side, or the power to imagine.
, When we sleep, thi reasoning side is always dormant, but the
visualizing side is either active or has the power to become active.
Dreams are the result of a dormant sense of reason and the ac
tive power to imagine dreams draw heavily upon the energies of
the whole body, varying according to intensity, and the result is a
restless sleep.
Or, there may be a tensity of muscles during sleep, with or with
out dreams, but in either case it is enervating not a restful sleep.
It is directly a question of the state of nerves.
And the state of nerves may be the state of the organs of diges
tion and eliminations, and the whole may be the state of mind dur
ing the day.
Any of us who live in a state of worry and anxiety, who do our
work during the day in a state of excitement and on the "most-haste-less-speed-'
principle, cannot expect sound restful sleep during the
night and even though we may sleep.
Most medical authorities say that it i3 not the amount of sleep,
but in the dtgre3 of round restful sleep; that sound restful sleep by
night is the tesult of calmness of action and freedom of worry dur
ing the day.
But calmness and freedom of worry are aain a question of
nerves.
, And nerves are i question of the general health the proper
functioning of the boiily organs.
We all know, for iPbtanco, that at one time a small matter may
worry us, while at another time a larg?r matter may fail to have any
effect upon us at all. The difference is in the state of the health
one time over another.
There are many points of attack in the circle of complete health,
but it all has its basis in mind thinking in the calmness of action
and moderation in all indulgences, inclining the matter of food.
CARELESS WORDS
THERE'S nobody that's criticised quit so much as the Al
mighty. And there are veyfew of us who think that we can't
run the universe more efficiently than God.
This should give the most of us a great deal of comfort. For if
men will persist in f;nding fault with God who is perfect how
can we escape their criticism?
"A servant is not greater than his master" that's the way the
Master Himself put n when He told His disciples that if men per
secuted Him they wftuid also persecute them.
But ordinarily men criticise each other through careless speech
rather than because o: hatred in their hearts just as they swear
and "take God's name in vain." They don't mean all they say it's
just pure cussedness which most cf them deplore even more than
you do.
Next time you become hurt because somebody criticised you
just hark back to the last time you criticised somebody else and
you'll find that you won't have to go very tar -back over the road
to discover the wreckage you caused in somebody else's life because
of your thoughtless wcrds.
The habit t-f rising to make a few remarks is much like the
drug habit. As the years pass, more and more of it is required to
the victim.
The new German cabinet includes a chief of the colonial office,
for whom Germany seems to have about as much need as it has for
a minister of the navy.
The average man's opinion concerning the league plan is the
opinion fed to him by his party leaders.
Herr Simon protests against the short time given Germany to
make kr.ov.n her iatentions. Serbia had less time in which to decide
a similar question.
The Hun's complaint is that requiring him to reform before ad
mitting him. to the league i3 equivalent to keeping him out in perpetuity.
Now that the big job is finished, we advise Lenine to pick out
a comfortable castle in Holland.
Heinie wanted a place in the sun and got it in the neck.
In Europe it Ia a hard matter to toll a man's exact rank in so
ciety, bul over here one may refer to Bradstreet's.
Thore arc people who have sense, and then there are people who
think Germany will not re-establish her spy system.
No man knows that the league will bo a success", but every man
man who made tho acquaintance of cooties will be glad to give it
a trial.
The less a man has In his head, the more comes out of his mouth.
Tho iiKin who talks about how much ho gives isn't much more
annoying than the one who talks about how little he eats.
And nations sh.fr boat their swords into plowshares, and their
version of the war into the heads of children.
Tho pre.-ont opinion is that war i3 a crime against God and man,
but that in in h glory may bo got in the practice of it.

SHIP ORE BY MAIL
TUCSON, July 4. When Marshal
Kilburn. new star route contractor,
started out on his first trip to Quitoja
Wednesday he had yet to learn of
what irouble awaited hin: at the
Steppes camp, six miles out of Oa
sis, for trouble had been piling up
for him in the shape of a big ship
ment of high grade silver and gold
ore, in 50-pound sacks, each sack
stamped with parcel post stamps,
which under his contract he must
haul, together with a miscellaneous
assortment of packages to be brought
in. All the contract calls for is
three trips a week, at the rate of $15
per round trip.
According to advices from Oasis,
the Steppes are a family of three
men, wives and a mother. They have
a high grade property which they
work theiriselves. Until quite recent
ly, they shipped their ore by truck.
Recently, however, they concluded to
ship the stuff by parcel post. Con
sequently they allowed it to pile up
until it reached 500 poudds. It will
take some time for the star route
carrier to deliver the stuff in the
city, where it will be delivered by
the Tucson postoffice to a ware
house here, but the Steppes are not
pressed lo get to a smelter for they
are in the peculiar position of hav
ing such a grade of ore that every
shipments brings a big profit.
Samples of the ore brought to the
city has excited considerable com
ment among mining men, many of
whom went to the camp and made
substantial offers to buy the prop
erty, all of which were rejected. The
Steppes, it is said, flatly refuse to
soli the property and have been
working along leisurely, living off
their production and making a prof
it with crude shipment. Ever so of
ten they send in a lead, which runs
heavily in silver, copper and gold.

NEW GOLD FINDINGS
GLOBE, July 4 Sam Morrow ol
this city has made a rich gold strike!
at the old sylvanite camp . 22 miles j
from Hachita. N. M., in the Little j
Hatchet mountains. ' Gold was first I
discovered there in 1908, Morrow be-'
ing one of the discoverers. The firtsj
product was placer in the mountain
washes and rich float was found in
many places.
Morrow has been holding the
prcperty since 1908, spending practi
cally all of his earnings in an at
tempt to find the lode from which
the rich float and placer emanated.
His labor was rewarded recently by
the discovery of the mother lode, or
at least one of them. The lode is
20 to 30 feet wide on the surface.
Old timers from Cripple Creek,
Colo., say the ledge is fonolite, the
same formation gold as was found in
Colorado. The best assays from
Morrow's property ran 526S.S0 per
ton in gold. He is not offering the
property for sale but has organized
a company and will start deveolp
ment at once.
FOREST LAND RELEASED
PHOENIX, July 4. Action of
greatest importance to the state was
taken by the state land board at heir
meeing yesterday in the governor's
office. At the suggestion of the for
est service, the board voted to re- J
linquish to the federal government
all state school lands within the va
rious forest reserves that are suit
able for agriculture, so as to allow
the government to have them enter
ed upon and improved as homesteads.
' The total amount of land to be re
linquished is 6,322 acres located in
six different forest reserves and is
at present administered by the for
est service and not by the state, land
department.
In lieu of the land to De relinquish
ed, the state will receive an
equal amount of land oiftside the re
serves which will be rented by the
state land department and will bring
in as large, if not a larger income
than under the present arrangement.
"This action of the land board,"
said Governor Campbell last night,
"will result in the settlement of the
land relinquished by homesteaders,
which means more hon cs and more
population for the state."
While Wilson is on that speaking tour to explain the peace
treaty, wo truot he will explain the conference definition of freedom
of tb seas.

ANOTHER SNAKE STORY
t
A tale ccmos from the Sahuarita
district, 50 miles south of Tucson,
which marks the opening of the sea
son for snake stories. A family
named Gomez, living upon a small
ranch rfhree miles from the station,
were awakened a few nights ago by
the violent cries of thoir lS-months
old child, sleeping in a small bed
under the open window. Investiga
tion found a rattlesnake six feet long
coiled in the baby's crib. It had al
ready sot its poisoned fangs twice in
the arm of the child, which was al
ready swollen to double natural size
and was rapidly turning black.
The parents hurriedly applied all
the remedies within their reach and
rushed tho baby to a small country
store several miles away whore they
hoped to find advice and help. A

on a ranch in the valley and by tho
time he was reached, the child had

ARIZONA TO HAVE
HERD OF BUFFALO
PHOENIX. July 4. Arizona may
come into the ownership of a herd
of American buffalo, or bison, if the
plans being worked out by the state
game warden, . Joe V. Prochaska,
come co completion. He is negotiat
ing with the officials of the Wichita
game preserve in the Wichita moun-i
tains in the western part of Oklaho
ma, to exchange young antelope for
buffalo.
The Wichita preserve has long
had one of the most famous herds
of bison extant and the officials are ;
desirous of securing the antelope
which the game warden is arranging ,
to have trapped to make the ex
chaange. The buffalo herd, starting with
about ten head, if secured, will be
placed in the Tonto country, where
they can be well cared for. "I be- i
lieve that everything possible should
be done to preserve to posterity this
greatest of American game ani
mals," said Prochaska yesterday,
"and we in Arizona should do our
share to help perpetuate them."

INDIANS ON PAROLE
PHOENIX, July 4. Glimpses of by
gone days such as seldom come with
in the limits of even a western city,
were evident today when warriors
from Tinia, Maricopa and Apache
tribes rode on parade through the
business streets about 11 o'clock.
The display of Indian horsemanship
marked the opening of the annual
fair held on the reservation near
Fort McDowell, or 12 miles east of
Central avenue on the Thomas road.
Brief and not particularly spectac
ular, the parade this morning yet
stood for something very significant,
the friendly union of three powerful
central Arizona tribes. Not many
years ago these same men or thoir
fathers wore riding in full war paint
and feathers to wage a cruel war on
each other. Now .they, can meet to
gether in friendly sp6rjs and pas
times like tribesmen of the , same
clan. '
Without the war paint or feathers,
weniing broad sniilos and led by
peaceful but inspirited music by the
Indian school band, tho riders on pa
rade marked a great step in tho pro
gress of the rod-skins under the cave
and t'itelig of the government.
AMSTERDAM, July 4 There is
nothing to prevent the former German
emperor or the former crown prince
from leaving Holland at their pleasure,
according to high government author
ity at The Hague, quoted by the Am
sterdam Telegraaf correspondent. If
either of them should leave, nowever,
the official quoted said, the surprise
of their departure would be "unpleas
ant, both for the Dutch government
and the Dutch people."
"Should there come, however, a de
mand for the former kaiser's etradi
tion" the official said in an interview,
"and should he then want to depart
suddenly.x" it is possible he would be
prevented. He can according to the
law of extradition be "arrested" at
the request of a foreign government,
but a demand for his extradiaion must
be made within a certain period
"Extradition is subject to a number
of restrictions formalities and guaran
tees Should there come a demand
which is technically correct and in
Order the government must first ob
tain the advice of the tribunal under
whose legal jurisdiction tne person
wanted is residing. Amerongen being
in the department of Utrecht the
tribunal of that department would
have t.o decide whether tne rormer
emperor should be extradited
"The former kaiser must be heard
by a tribunal. The hearing may take
place en camera and at that hearing
he could be represented by counsel,..
Within fourteen day3 after the hear
ing the tribunal must inform the min
ister of justice of its decision, where
upon the government -would act."
The Telegraaf correspondent says
the Dutch government intend3 to ad
here strictly to a judicial point of
view and "to put it mildly, it is very
doubtful whether the extradition
would be permitted."
TO GIVE IN AS LAST RESORT
LONDON, July 5. The allies, ac
cording to the Daily Mail, have re
ceived assurances that the Dutch
government in the last resort will not
refuse to surrender the former Ger
man emperor for trial.
The newspaper says that the neces
sary formal objections will doubt
less be raised to maintain the rights
of Dutch sovereignty, but as the de
mand for his person can be made in
the name of the League of Nations,
national rights will not be infringed
and there is no doubt the Dutch gov
ernment will be quite ready to get
rid of the unwelcome guest.

Friendship of Two Nations
PARIS, July 4 (By the Associated
Press.) A gala performance, of
"Faust' 'at the opera, with Marshal
Foch and General Pershing as the spe
cially honored guests, concluded the
notable joint French and American
celebration of the Fourth of July. The
day opened with an early review dem
onstrating France's participation in
the American revolution and the cel
ebration afforded varied entertain
ment for the thousancs of American
soldiers marking time ?n Paris while
awaiting transportation homeward.
Wild West on Champs Elysees
There was even a real wild west pa
rude down the Champs Elysees ami
through the Place de la Concorde,
given by an American army circus,
showing in Paris. The cowboys, cow
girls and Indians .riding gaily to the
music of a wild west band, proved a
far greater attraction to the French
than the brilliant military spectacle.
Popcorn, peanuts, lemonade and ice
cream were offered in abundance by
the various service canteens and flag
sellers were displaying badges of the
American colors everywhere. The
weather man, however, did not offer
sufficient heat to make it a typical
American celebration and speed up
the ball games and races. The sky
was overcast the entire day.
Foch Gets Great Ovation
The tremendous ovation given Mar
shal Foch at the American chamber
of commerce luncheon and his re
sponses to demands for a speecb, was
one of the most pleasant features of
the celebration. Marshal Foch was
seated beside General Pershing at the
luncheon. The address of General
Pershing was supposed to conclude
the program, but the 400 diners, in
cluding all the prominent members of
the American colony, the British am
bassador, and nearly all the South
American diplomats in Paris, rose and
insistently demanded a speech from
Marshal Foch.
Touches Glasses With Pershing
The marshal spoke of the hearty co
operation of the French and American
troops and the common ideals of the
two peoples, and proposed a toast to
"the victorious American armies,"
which he drank after touching glasses
with General Pershing. The applause
continued for many minutes.
Later in the afternoon there were
scenes of Franco-American frater
nizing at the Paris city hall in honor
of General Pershing, Rear Admiral
Harry S. Knapp, commanding the
American naval forces in European
waters, and their staffs. There was
much music and patriotic speeches,
and Premier Clemenceau presented
General Pershing with a souvenir
symbolizing France's gratitude to
West Toint, where the souvenir will
eventually find a place.
The day appropriate!! was wound
up with a series of banquets.
A round of gieties was provided for
American soldiers and sailors who
found open house at the Y. M. C. A.
and other centers.

OF BIC BENEFIT
THIS STATE
The report of. the weather bureau
of the lT. S. Department of Agricul
ture for the current week in Arizona
is as follows:
Phoenix, Ariz., July 4.
Western New Mexico
Summer rains have put in their ap
pearance over parts of the range
country, freshening vegetation and
encouraging those inclined to fear
that they might be delayed. Sub
stantial showers fell near the border
in the vicinity of Douglas and No
gales ard in the southern part of Nav
ajo county. Light showers have fal
len in Gila and Pima counties.. The
condition of stock continues general
ly good; near Pinto where rain is
badly needed cattle are reported as
"rolling fat." In the immediate vi
cinity of the Gila where grass has ma-
tured and is dry stock are still in fair!
condition. In western New Mexico;
where only occasional showers have
cccurred both ranpes and stock are
still in fair condition. In western
New Mexico where only occasional j
f-howers have occurred both ranges
and stock are in from fair to goodi
condition. The water supply f jr
is reported as generally ade
quate but for irrigation purposes the
supply for the smaller areas is gen
erally short.
Crop Progress In Arizona
While the absence of rain in the
southwest is looked upon by many as
little -short of a calamity it is not re
garded ..by those interested in the
harvesting of alfalfa and wheat The
season has been exceptionally favor
able for the growth and harvesting
of both crops." Cantaloupes aie rip
ening under the most favorable cir
cumstances and have rarely been of
better Quality. lima cotton is at a
normal stage generally and in favor
ed localities bolls are half grown.
Crop conditions at higher elevations
continue generally good but corn and
oats would be greatly benefitted by
rain.

quarters where the provisions were
distributed. Only food stores were
looted.
During the afternoon crowds of
strikers congregated In the Piazza
Victcr Emmanuel, but were dispersed
by police and carabineers.
