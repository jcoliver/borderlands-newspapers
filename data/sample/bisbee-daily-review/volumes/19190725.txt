HEARING DF DEPORTATION GASES
GROWS III INOTON! AS I. W. II.
TESTIMONY GROWS IN HAZINESS
Same "Red" Witnesses Have Same Opinions That Some of
Bisbee's Citizens Appeared' to Be "Walking Around" by
July 12, 1917; County Engineer Ryan "Seems" to Have
Had Something to Do With Something; Pioneer Councilman
And Miner is Next "Kidnaper? Slated for "Prosecution."
(Special to The Review)
DOUGLAS, Ariz., July 24. Testi
mony which showed the rise of the
Industrial Workers of the World and
the decline of the Western Federa
tion of Miners in the Warren Dis
trict during the summer of 1917 was
the only interesting feature of the
preliminary hearings today of J. C.
(Dick) Kyan, county hignway engi
neer, and Jess and William Toland,
of Bisbe, three of the 250 Bisbee
and Douglas citizens charged by
Fred W. Brown with kidnaping as a
result of the I. W. W. reportations in
1917. The greater part of the testi
mony heard during the three hear
ings was but a repetition of that
which has been offered during pre
vious preliminaries and, with one or
two exceptions, the witnesses proved
to be the same members of the de
portee colony here who have testi
fied against the accused citizens in
previous cases.
Testimony Continues Hazy
The testimony differed but little
in all three hearings; the defendants
had each been seen in Bisbee, War
ren, or at the ball park on the day
of the deportations, and they had
used no- force- v' violence toward any
of the witnesses and had said noth
ing other than to tell some of the
deportees to stay in line. Several of
the witnesses told of having seeg, or
heard of. physical force being used
in arresting the deportees, but none
of the witnesses could' tell the name
or give aorurate descriptions of tho
alleged assailants.
Ryan "Seemed1 to Be in Charge i
J. B. Chase, one of the deportees,
told of having seen Ryan in the bait
park at Warren with other citizens
on July 12th. The' defendant, said
Chase, "Beemed to have command or
putting us in the cars."
Richard Denning, another deportee,;
said he saw Ryan give orders to oth-i
or citizens to keep the deportees (from)
scattering out, when the deported
men were arrested.
Extra! Witness Not An I. W. W.
Lee Ferry, the third witness called
by the state, said that he had not
be$n deported, was not an L W. W.
and had dropped out of the American
Federation of Labor at Bisbee , be
cause he did not like the president
of the carpenters' local there.- He
testified that he had seen Ryan help
ing round up the I. W. W. and strike
sympathizers on July 12th. Ferry
said that he was working for the
government at the time of the deno
tation, helping build a camp at Low
ell. , A group of men came to his
house, he testified, for what he as
sumed was the purpose of arresting
him on the morning of the 12th :of
July. He testified that he announc
ed to them that he was working, for
the government and threatened to kill
any man who attempted to arrest
him. ' '
"And I'd have done it, too,", he
added. ' " ' ;
Admits He Wasn't Molested
Questioned as to whether any of
the men who visited his house had
made any attempt whatever than, or
later, to take him away, he admitted
that they.- had not. Ferry several
times ' reiterated his statement that
he was working for the government
at the time of the deportations, but
on cross-examination by counsel for
the defense said that the .day follow
ing the deportations he had gone to
work for the Standard Oil company.

ported very heavy.
despite the fact that the American
Federation of Labor carpenters' local
in the Wjaxren district had called a
strike several days previous to that
time. He said tlat, although a mem
ber of that local, he had not taken
much interest in its affairs.
Animus Is Hinted
Ferry testified to having worked
several time for' Ryan, bince the
latter was appointed county highway
engineer, and cross examination
brought out the fact that he had
ceased work during his last job with
Ryan after an altercation with the
defendant regarding wages. After
having been excused, Ferry was re
called to the witness stand and asked
by Attorney W. E. Burgess, for the
defense, if he had been subpoenaed
by the state as a witness. Ferry re
plied that he had come to Douglas to
testify against the defendants at the
instance of a man named Mike Pin
tick, and. was served with papers to
appear as a witness after he had
reached this city.
One of the tactics in dealing with
the loyal miners who had refused to
walk out in June and July, 1917, dur
ing the Wobbly strike, was told from
thp witness stand by Nick Medino
vich, another deportee witness for
the stato. Medinovich, a native of
Austria, who came to the United
States in 1911 but did not take out
his first citizenship papers until
1916, said he had been employed in
a restaurant at Lowell for some time
prior to the deportation. After the
strike, he said, on being cross exam
ined by the ticieiibe, the proprietor of
the eating house had given orders
not to sell any more lunches or al
low any food to be taken from the
restaurant. BVfore the strike, Med
inovich admitted, the restaurant had
done a big business selling lunches
to miners. The witness stated that
the order forbidding the sale of
lunches during the strike had been
givea to the .proprietor by "some
body," but he did not know who it
was. . '
Medinovlch's only "testimony against
Ryan was that he had seen him In
Lowell on the day of the deportations
"running up and down the line" with
other men. Ryan had said or done
nothing to him, he said.
No Witnesses for Defense
Ryan's hearing was completed in
about an hour and a half. No wit
nesses were called by the defense.
Familiar facts -vere 'again heard on
the witness, stand during the hearing
of Jess Toland. J. F. Hollman, who
Joined the I. W. W. two days after
that organization called the strike in
the Warren district, tolj of having
seen the defendant at Lowell and at
Warren on the day of the deporta
tions. Questioned as to his sympathies
during the Bisbee trouble, he testi
fied that he had Joined the Wobblles
on the 28th or 29 th of June, 1917,
several months after he had given up
membership in the Western Federa
tion of Miners.
Object to "Weaning" Question
Vigorous objections were offered
by the county attorney when Attor
ney Frank Curley, of counsel for the
defense, asked the witness if it was
"not a fact that there was a cam
paign on by the I. W. W. to wean
away the members of the Western

President's Foes - In Senate
Abandon War on League as
They Exploit New Grievance
On Anglo-French War Pact
I
I WASHINGTON. July 24. While
I Republican and' Democratic senators
were feeling out the possibilities of
former president Taft's plan for in
terpretations in the league of nations
ratification, the attack on President
Wilson's course in concluding peace
was renewed today from a new quar-
j ter.
I The storm center of the assault
was a section of the defensive treaty
with France which published texts
have shown to provide that it must
be presented for senate ratification
at the same time as the treaty with
I Germany. The latter was submitted
two weeks ago; the former brought
back from Paris by the president and
still in his possession.
' Say Wilson Violated Pledge
In an hour of bitter debate Chair
man Lodge, of the foreign relations
committee and Senator Brandagee,
Republican, Connecticut, accused the
president of violating the pledge ot
simultaneous presentation made
when he signed the treaty and Sen
ators Hitchcock, Nebraska, and Wil
liams, Mississippi, Democrats of the
committee, replied that the charges
only renewed an attempt to "Ham
string" and discredit the president.
Later Chairman Lodge presented a
resolution by which the senate would
"respectfully request" that the treaty
be submitted so that the senate could
consider it "in connection with the
treaty of peace with Germany."
A request for immediate consider
ation was blocked by Senator Rob.
inson. Democrat, Arkansas, and the
resolution will probably come up to
morrow. It carries this quotation
from section fojj of the treaty as
published: "The present treaty will
be submitted to the senate at the
same time as the treaty of Versailles
is submitted for its advice and con
sent to ratification."
Chary of Taft Plan !
The suggestion of Mr. Taft, for six
interpretations in . the ratification
resolution effecting the league cove-1
nant led to no discussion on the sen
ate floor, but held first'place i& cloak
room talk and in many conferences
among senators of all shades of
opinion. Most of them seemed in
clined to look ' askance at the sug
gested plan and to withhold comment
for the present. Chairman Lodge
had nothing to say; neither had Sen
ator Hitchcock. sBoth, however, in
dicated their positions had been in
no wise changed by Mr. Taft's -arguments.
The group of Republicans who. un
der the leaderships of Senators Mo
Cumber, Republican, North Dakota,
and McNary, Oregon, are arguing for
a middle course, received the former
president's; views with enthusiasm,
although not committing themselves,
especially as to hia program of inter
pretations. - They say the form of
any reservations or interpretations
still is an open question among them,
though they hope to see it settled
soon.
Shantung and the league also were
debated in the senate. Senator Rob
inson presenting the legal claims of
Japan in the Shantung peninsula.
Senator Fletcher, Democrat, Florida,
supporting the league, and Senator
Lenrplot, Republican, Wisconsin, de
claring he could accept certain fea
tures of the covenant without reser
vations to safeguard independent ac
tion. . ' -

Earl Curzon Scoffs at Any
Idea of Such a Comparison
LONDON, July 24. (By the Asso
ciated Press). It is possible that for
mer Emperor William may not be
tried in London, according to an an
nouncement made in the house of
lords today by Earl Curson of Kedles
ton, government leader in, the upper
house.
The lords passed the treaty and
the Anglo-French treaty through all
stages. In the course of the discus
sion Vis Count Bryon, former ambas
sador at Washington, deprecated hold
ing the trial of the former German' em
peror at London.
Baron Buckmaster said there were
grave reasons "why the government
ought to pursue no further the project
o f trying the German War Lord. It
was certainly unfitting, he declared,
to ask an English judge to sit on such
a tribunal to administer a law he does
not know by procedure that has never
been defined, in a court he does not
control.
In his reply Earl Curzon said he
thought hhe kaiser In exile In no way
comparable with Charles I or Napo
leon. He was unable to imagine that
a man who had ignomimously fled his
country could be turned into a martyr
or a hero by a trial, while hia presence
near the German border might be a
political danger.
It might be, however, that the trial
will not be held in London. No final
decision has been reported.
Even if the trial were within the
shores of Britain, it by no means fol
lowed that London would be the place
selected.

DOUGLAS, Ariz., July' 24. Com
plete understanding was reached to
day upon details of a plan whereby
the officers of the United States armv
in Arizona and those of the Mexican
Federal army In Sonora, will eo-oper-
ate to prevent trouble along the Ari-
zona-Sonora border. This was the
outcome of a conferenc held in Agua
Prieta, this afternoon between Briga
dier General W. R. Smedberg, com
manding the Arizona military district,
and General P. Elias Calles, governor
of Sonora, and secretary of commerce
and industry in the Carranza cabinet.
The conference was attended by Col

Camp Harry J. JoneB, near here; Cap
tain F. D. Wright of the army intelli
gence department, and W. D. King,
a Douglas attorney, who acted as in
terpreter for the conferences.
The United States army officers
crossed from Douglas in an automo
bile, and upon arriving at Agua Prieta
were received with full military hon
ors, the garrison being drawn up in
parade formation. A guard Of honor
escorted them from the boundary to
the headquarters of General Calles,
who, dressed in the uniform of his
army rank, awaited the American of
ficers. He wa3 attended by Lienteu
ant Colonel Rafael Buelna and other
officers.
Following introductions, the confer
ence discussed recent incidents out of
which friction had arisen in the bor
der district, particularly In ttie
vicinity of Nogales, Ariz. General
Calles stated that he had strengthen
ed the" border guard in that vicinity
and could guarantee that there would
be no repetition of the alleged thefts
of livestock which had caused misun
derstanding and friction in the past.
A program of co-operative efforts on
the part of American and Mexican
army officers was discussed and
adopted, promising to eliminate such
points of friction as have existed.
General Smedberg, following his
return to Douglas, expressed satisfac
tion over the result of the conference,
the result of which he will communi

charge of failure to comply with the
Sonora state statute making employ-!
ment of at least 80 per cent Mexican
help in all establishments, industrial
or commercial, compulsory, according
to El Tiempo, a newspaper published
in Cananea which reached Douglas
today.
The merchants were first given
warning that they must replace
Chinese clerks with Mexicans. Upon
their failure to comply in the time
limit allowed the merchants were ar
rested, tried and convicted. "Heavy
penalties were imposed," the paper
said, but whether this included both
fines and imprisonment, allowable i
under the terms of the law, is not
stated.

Mexicans to what he -termed the

Chinese control most of the mer

their mutual benefit society to which
every Chinese in the state is said to
pay dues. It is understood steps are
to be taken to test the legality of

I.W.W. Testimony
Is Monotonous
(Continued from Page One)
ity of the question Justice W. C. Jack
closed the argument between the at
torneys, by directing Attorney Curley
to ask the question again in a way
that would allow the witness to make
a direct answer. The phrasing of the
query was changed and H oilman re
plied that he did not know of such
a campaign.
Tells How Weeds Grow
Questioned as to the standing of
the two organizations at the time of
the strike. Hollman testified that
the I. W. W. had increased its mem
bership in the Warren district, while
the Western Federation of Miners, an
American Federation of Labor un
ion, had practically ceased to exist in
Bisbee.
McCarthy's Grand Total
Tim McCarthy, who yesterday de
clared himself in favor of a strike for
a two-hour working day, was called
to the Btand for the state. McCarthy,
whose testimony at previous hearings
gives him credit for having worked
a grand total of several days since
1912, and who said he joined the I.
W .W. after the deportations because
he thought the deportees should pre
pare for violence, testified that he
had seen Toland after the deporta
tion proceedings were over. The sab
stance of his testimony was that To
land had advised him to "keep his
mouth shut" on the action that had
been taken by the citizens. He said
he had not seen Toland at anv time
while the deportations were taking
place. Counsel for the defense po
litely excused McCarthy without
questioning him.
I. W. W. Uses Memory Stimulator
Dominic Catero said he had been
secured as a witness for the state by
Fred W. Brown, one of the men de
ported, who swore to the blanket
warrant charging the 250 defendants
with kidnaping. Catero proved a
very willing witness and, when his
memory failed him, produced an in
nocent . looking black note book
which, he enthusiastically informed
Attorney" Burgess, "got lots of tings
in it. Judge. You watch me. I show
'em all. Sure." Catero also testified
to having seen Toland at Lowell on
July 12th.
An Apocryphal Blacklist
Catero was confident that a "black
list" bearing his name, was in ex
istence "somewhere." but he was not
positive just how big or how little
it was, when it had been started or
who had it. Catero's testimony show
ed that he, too, was one of the formet
members of the Western Federation
of Miners members who had dropped
out of that organization and joined
the I. W. W. The witness said he
joined the Wobblies because 1 he
thought he ought to belong to some
kind of an organization. Cross ex
amination brought out that he was
not certain as to just what the doc
trines of the I. W. W. were and could
not remember the names of the men
who induced him to join.
Catero said he had went out during
the I. W. W. strike and had acted as
a picket. After the deportation he
said, he returned to Bisbee and se
cured employment in several places
but was unable to hold his jobs.
"Why did you quit work at the
Denn-Arizona?" asked Burges.
"They stopped my pay," replied
Dominic.
"Well." sa-d the county attorney.

The hearing of William Toland was
the most brief ytt held. The testi
mony of J. F. Hollman, Thomas G.
Green, Dan McGivern and) Richard
Denning was almost identical: that
Toland was with other citizens, all
armed, at various places from Lowell
to the Warren ball park. None of
the witnesses had seen him take any
action or say anything to the men
deported. The defense excused all
witnesses without question, and of
fered no evidence in rebuttal.

SACRAMENTO WOMAN SAYS TANLAC
MADE HER FEEL LIKE NEW
PERSON.
"It certainly has paid me well to stick
to Tanlac, for five bottle have really and
truly made me feel like a new woman."
said Mrs. J. W. Warren, wife of a well
known Southern Pacific railroad man. re
siding at 611 29th street. Sacramento, in
telling1 of the benefits she has derived
from the medicine, recently. Mrs. War
ren was born in Sacramento. She has
always lived here, and has a wide circle
of devoted friends.
"At the time I began taking Tanlac,"
she continued, "I was so nervous and
weak I could hardly get the children
ready in the morning in time for school.
I had ah awful time with my stomach for
several months and .was all run down
In every way. I had no appetite and
what little I did eat would ferment and
bloat me until I was miserable. There
was a heavy pressure around my heart
all the time with terrible pains that made
me so faint and weak that I could hardly
get through with my housework. 1 was
in such a bad condition that I could hard
ly hold out to go down town and do a
little shopping. I was so weak and run
down that I spent about all my time on 1
the porch and in the yard, hoping that
would help me. I would get tip mornings
tired and nervous and feel that way all
day.
"My husband persuaded me to try Tan
lac after reading a testimonial from a
lady who had been relieved of troubles
similar to mine. My first two bottles
didn't seem to help me much, but I stuck
to it, thinking it must be good or so many
wouldn't say it had helped them, and
after finishing the third bottle my im
provement was very rapid. My stomach
has not given me a particle of trouble
since I finished that third bottle and I
am eating just anything and everything.
I am not the least bit nervous any more
and have more strength than 1 have had
in months. Why, just yesterday I mowed
the lawn, both front and back, and stood
it fine. Last Sunday, after spending the
day at the park, I cooked dinner for 12
people. Well, when bed time came, 1
admit I was tired, but not the same way
I had been before. It was that tired
feeling that makes one lie down and sleep
like a child and not the kind that makes
one feel weak, nervous and restless.
When I weighed about three weeks ago
1 had gained six pounds and have gained
about that much more by this time. Any
way I have improved so much that my
friends are often speaking of it. I don't
have that weary look' in my eyes nor
that tired, worn out feeling any more,
and I am more grateful than I can put
into word lor wh:it Tanlac has done for
me."

"CHASE THE MOLLYCODDLES OUT OF
PUBLIC LIFE."
A JOB FOR THE PHRENOLOGIST.
about 600 men, has decided to begin work at once for an
other boxing bill and to get all returned soldiers in the
state rb take some interest in the next legislative elections.
A representative of this organization was in Chicago the other
day. He gave up a good law practice to go to war. He said the sol
diers intended to "chase the mollycoddle out of public life."
The mollycoddle has chased about everything out of general life
that soldiers would want, and for the preservation of such qualities'
as soldiers need it may be necessary to chase the mollycoddle.
Some of these soldiers may have seen a few "Verboten' signs
if they -were with the army of occupation. We haven't put up the
sign, but we have been handed it. Our verboten reaches for the man .
in his home, in his personal customs and habits, in his amusements.
We cannot have boxing because there is a moral verboten Plas
tered on it. The president asked for the exemption of the less than
3 per cent beer, but congress plastered another moral verboten on it.
This is becoming the land of coddle the only land in the white
world which is by statute demanding the white liver. There is not
another" great nation made up of whites in all the world which has
such a body of prohibitive law, not another one which is so regulat
ing the habits and customs of its citizens.
France, an intelligent nation, makes no such attempt. Great
Britain does not. Even the straight laced Canadians to the north
of us won't have it. If we try to find' our equal we'll have to search
for the laws intended to regulate the Russian mujik and they drove
him to the wildest political radicalism the world has -seen for a hun
dred years.
WHERE THE URBAN TRAINED FARMEB WINS

are turning, is usually an object of sympathy to the sorrowing
neighbors for some moons after he begins to sow, and to cul
tivate, maybe, to harvest.
But there is one thing the city man on the farm does do that
the average lifelong farmer does not.
On the rare occasions when the city man has anything to sell he
sells it in the best market.
Also he usually buys in a cheaper market than his neighbor, who
has a line of credit at the country store, and who never bothers about
prices.
If we were to be asked for the most significant clue to the new
agriculture, we would choose the new salesmanship that farmerB are
beginning to adopt.
Many farms now have their own truck lines, and transport their
products direct to the public markets, or the retailers and commission
bouses.
The urban mind first saw the advantage of the farmer having
his own "railroad."
The city man may not raise much on his agricultural experiment
station, but his sense of management, his ideas of salesmanship, and
his knowledge of the power of co-operation will be a Godsend to the
real producers.
WHAT'S WHAT IN IRELAND?
EAMONN DE VALERA shows better judgment than 6ome of
his supporters when he reminds them that in hissing thft.
name of Woodrow Wilson they are hissing the President of
the United States and that, however much they may disagree
with Mr. Wilson, it is distasteful to him who is here only as a guest
and in a way on sufferance.
Sir Edward Carson, who, according to one London correspond
ent, narrowly escaped indictment for treason because of opposition
to home rule before the war, but was later heaped with honors by the
l.'ritish government, shows. poorer judgment than most of his follow
ers when he'attacks the middle-course policy of Sir Horace Plunkett,
confuses the religious issue with the political, and orders the United
States to "mind her own business."
The Irish question has assumed a dangerous trend, and so long
as we have to rely on propaganda, and a strict censorship is kept
over the facts as they develop in Ireland, the world which wants to
see justice done must sit back and wonder "who's looney now."
THE AMEIRCAM LEGION
INCORPORATION' of the American Legion by congress is emi
nently proper. It is a great national organization to perpetuate
the principles established by the American service men in the
war. Two millions of them fought in France and Flaaders. Two
million more were mobilized under arms, ready to follow their fel
lows across the ocean. These soldiers, sailors and marines, barring
only their heroic comrades who made the supreme sacrifice, are to
be gathered into ono patriotic brotherhood which should prove a
commanding influence in stableizing the conditions of human freedom
which have been bought with their blood and valor.
The noble purposes of the American Legion as expressed in the
bill before congress may be taken to convey America's answer to
Bolshevism and the mischievous apostles of social unrest. The
American League is formed "to up hold and defend the constitution
of the United States, to safeguard and transmit to posterity the prin
ciples of justice, freedom and democracy for which the members or
the military and naval forces contended in the war, to maintain law
and order and to .foster and perpetuate 100 per cent Americanism.'
Such a program is one of the holiest which could be inscribed
as a declaration of princ iples on the banners of those who fought that
this nation should be free from molestation by the enemies of dem
ocratic institutions. The American Legion has made a good start.
Units should be established at every point where a group of soldiers,
sailors and marines can he assembled.
It generally costs a fellow from one to ten thousand dollars in
this country to prove than he is not guilty.
Even after the meek have inherited the earth some blustering
trust official will come around and collect rent.
We read that bustles are coming back. Woman is constantly
enlarging her sphere. If it isn't one way it's another.

HH CABARET
SOI FUNCTION
GIRLS PROMISE
If you are looking for a big time
tonight don't go gallopin' off to any
other place, because our own Hi-Y
girls is gonna have the last yelp in
celebrations.
Yes, can you imagine a real live
shindig that starts at 8 o'clock and
continues '"till the cows come

thing pretty classy billed for some
other place, pause in your meditation
just long enough to cast your lum

starts with a whoop and a dance with
a cabaret. But what's a cabaret? We
confess that, as a rule, they are not
always the snappies things in the

MARAHUANA GARDENS
CHOPPED UP BY
of marahuana. weighing about 100
pounds, was dug up by Sheriff John)
Montgomery today at a Mexican vil-
lage south of Tempe. He said he
went to Guadalupe with Ranger De
Witt, but could find no marahuana
there, contrary to expectations.
Montgomery, who is taking the re
sponsibility upon his . own shoulders
to clean the county of marahuana in
the absence of any state law, is re
ceiving strong backing by the native
and better class of Mexican citizen
who realize that marahuana is the
worst enemy of many of the Mexican
people here, Montgomery saying he
would like to have the cooperation
of the city governments of the sev
eral incorporated towns of the coun
ty by passing anti-marahuana ordi
nances similar to the one in opera
tion in Phoenix. This ordinance
makes it an offense to grow or hare
marahuana in . one's possession or to
smoke it.
Montgomery sad it was a grave
mistake that the last legislature did
not pass an anti-marahuana law.
With the absence of whiskey, the
sheriff says, people seek marahuana
and other narcotics as a substitute
and says that he feels that the grow
ing of marahuana should be stopped

WATER FEUD AVERTED
AS JONES PREACHES
IN BENSON PULPIT
PHOENIX, July 24 How a church
service was turned into a public util
ity hearing to the end that a serious
water feud was averted, is the unus
ual story brought back from Benson.
Ariz., by F. A. Jones, member of the
Arizona corporation commission.
Recent floods destroyed the newly
built diversion dam of the Benson
Canal company, located on the San
Pedro river. This catastrophe com
ing at a time when irrigation was
a vital necessity and following
months of dissatisfaction over the
financial and business affairs of the
company as conducted by the three
men owning a majority of the stock,
led to an attempt on the part of mi
nority stockholders to jump the water
rights and take over the canal.
With all interested parties for
miles around in attendance at the
little Mormon church at Benson,
Jones took the pulpit t f reach a prac
tical sermon to the effect that noth
ing was to be accomplished through
subterfuge or legal controversy, and
urged that the dissenting factions get
together.
Following his suggestion each side
appointed a committee of two, these
selected a fifth and this joint com
miltee then named an entirely new
board of directors to take over the
tangled affairs of the company.
Jones further sueeested that Ihe
capitalization should be increased
from $10,000 to $100,000, ami I hat
bonds le floated to pay for a new
dam and other improvements. He
was given a rising vote of thanks.
TUCSON CENTRAL TRADE
COUNCIL TO HAVE NEW HOME
TUCSON, July 24. Central Trades
Council of Tucson has completed ar
rangements by which it will move
into new quarters August 1. The
lease for the old quarters in the Mar

pires this month and as the drug;
company contemplated enlarging its;
own quarters whereby it will occupy
all of the ground floor except one
store room and will arrange the top
floor for office suites, the Central
Trades Council not being able to re
new its lease on account of this ar
rangement, the officials of the coun
cil immediately made arrangements
with the Brotherhood of Railroad
Trainmen who hold their meeting on
North Stone avenue, near Penning
ton, whereby the Central Trades
(Council took over their lease for the
building which runs for the next
three and one-half years.
The Central Trades Council will
take over beside the lease of the
building, all the furnishings in the
bailding which will be so arranged
whereby the different unions will be
able to conveniently hold their meet
ings. The building contains one of
the best dancing halls in the city
and when the rooms are assigned to
the different unions and the office
fixed up for the business agent, it
will be a great improvement over
the present quarters.

MAYOR TO GET SALARY
TUCSON, July 24. Whether the
mayor of the city shall receive a saU
ary of $3G00 a year and councilmen
$1200 was the subject under discus
sion when the charter committee ad
journed at noon today after holding
its first meeting since organization
There was considerable difference of
opinion on the matter. Dr. Meade
Clyne thought that councilmen should
be either placed in charge of one of
the departments of the city at a goon
salary or paid considerably less than
$100 a month for merely attending
meetings. Mrs. Thomas llealy was
of the same, opinion. Elias Hedrick
thought that the $100 a month pro
vision would defeat the charter.
The committee was practically
unanimous in favoring a good salary
for the mayor but favored amending
the charter so as to privide that he
shall devote his entire time to tho
duties of the office.
in a statement recently submitted to
the committee by Senator New, Re
publican, of Indiana, and answered to
day by Mr. Palmer, who prepared an
affidavit from Mr. Palmer, repudiat
ing his previous statement.
, Mr. Palmer declared there was
nothing inconsistent m his jurisdic
tion of claims for property made
against the alien property custodian.
Declaring that he had never passed
personally on a single claim, as such
matters were handled by subordinates,
Mr. Palmer added: "Besides, these
claims must be settled by legislation
of congress after peace is proclaimed.
I have no doubt that congress will
provide money to prevent men from
occupying inconsistent positions."

BY REVIEW
STOCKS AND BONDS
NEW YORK. July 24. The same
speculative influences which . have
been foremost on the bull side of the
stock market since last Tuesday's
rapid recovery were operative again
today. Excepting the suspension of
"extra" dividends on the co-umons,
shares of Bethlehem steel, were main
ly encouraging. Passing of the Beth
lehem dividends occasioned little sur
prise, such a course having been pre
dicted ever since the United States
Steel directors took similar action
three months ago.
Motors and their distinctive subsi
diaries, notably Electric, Rubber .ind
Leather equipments, were heavily,
traded in, Stromberg carburetor fluc
tuating widly in a 12 point radius
and closing at a net gain of 3 points.
Tobaccos, shipping and food shares
contributed their recent large propor
tions at gross advances of 2 to 5
points.
All the favorite issues, including U.
S. Steel reversed their positions of
the early and intermediate sessions,
the reaction ranging from 2 to 6 points
and causing an irregular to heavy
close. Sales 1,600,000 shares.
Bonds, including Liberty and for
eign issues, were irregular, but sound
investment conditions were exempli -
fied by the success of the Swiss gov -
ernment loan and closing of the shell
transport syndicate offering. Total
bond sales, par value, $9,750,000. Old
U. S. bonds unchanged on call.
THE GRAIN MARKETS
CHTPAOn Tnlv 91 Torn nvprasred
a little higher in price today, owing
to widespread lack of rain. The close
was unsettled, c net lower to c
advance, with September $1.95 to
$1.95 and December $1.66 to
$1.66. Oats gained c to c. In
provisions the outcome varied form
25c decline to a rise of 50c. At the
outset buying odds predominated as
a result of the fact that the govern
ment map showed no rainfall any
where and that the forecast was gen
erally fair. In as much, however, as
no , excessively high temperatures
were noted, holders seemed disposed
to take profits whenever prices bulg
ed. Word from Argentina that new
high price records had been estab
lished attracted attention, but the ef
fect was more than offset later by
Illinois reports of cloudy conditions,
and lowered mercury.
Upturns in the oats market was due
largely to the difficulties of obtaining
cars enough to insure prompt move
ment of the crop.
Provisions ruled dull and irregular.
Commission houses sold lard and
pork. Shorts were buying ribs.
THE METAL MARKET
NEW YORK, July. 24. Lead, steady
and unchanged.
Bar silver. $1.07.
Copper, firm and quiet; electrolytic,
spot and July 23c; August 23
23c; September, 24c.
THE COTTON MARKET
NEW YORK, July 24. Cotton clos
ed steady at a net decline of 20 to 55
points.

SAYS SUPERVISORS AGAINST
THE DEPORTATION TRIALS
DOUGLAS, Ariz., July 24. I. C. E.
Adams, chairman of the board of sup
ervisors, of Bisbee, was in the city
yesterday, being called here on road
business to meet County Engineer
Smith. While here the financing of
the prosecution of the deportation
cases now before the justice court in
this city was brought to his attention
by witnesses taking up with him the
matter of their expenses. He said
lhat the board had been requested by
Jhe county attorney's office to open
an account at one of the banks here,
supply it with money and. allow the
county attorney to draw on it for
the expense money required for wit
nesses brought here to testify on be
half of the state, but that this could
not be done, as each item for such
expense must be passed upon by the
board as a separate demand. Mr.
Adam3, in speaking of the expense
of this deportation prosecution said
that some , palpable falsehoods have
been published in other counties ot
the state about the actions of the
board and one that he especially re
sents is a story to the effect that
the Cochise county .supervisors had
thrown the treasury of the county
open for use in the prosecutions. Mr.
Adams said that so far as he was
concerned, and he believed other
members of the board would agree
with him, that legal demands present
ed with the endorsement of the coun
ty attorney would be paid, but that
no money would be dished out for
that or any other purpose except on
a regular and legal demand.
Mr. Adams said that the county at
torney had been provided with what
the board' thought was sufficient to
meet the expenses of that office dur
ing the coming year, ; but that this
money could, not be used except on
bills duly audited by the board of su
pervisors.' Mr. Adams said that so
far as the board of supervisors are
concerned he does not believe that
a single member of it is in sympathy
with the whole sale arrests made in
the prosecutioa of those responsible
for the deportation ia Bisbee two
years ago.
Speaking of the road work in the
county Mr. Adams said that recent
storms and flood water had done con
siderable damage, but that nothing
serious had occurred anywhere. ' He
pointed out the necessity for a bond
issue in this county, as now being
worked out so that a substantial road
can be constructed from Douglas
through the Sulphur Springs valley
to Willcox and on to the Graham
county line. This, he said with the
completion , of the Borderland route
through the county would Brovide the
two principel trunk lines of road
east and west and north and south
ehrough the county. The road from
Bisbee to J3enson is now completed
and the money will be forthcoming
for the completion of the paved link
between Douglas and Bisbee. With
the bond issue as proposed, Mr.
Adams says that after the, permanent
roads are constructed the money to
be raised by the road tax levy in the
future would be sufficient to keep
the oads in repair. He thinks the up
keep of roads is fully as essential as
the original construction of them.
Work oiiHighways
Out of Tombstone
I. T. Grazier, division state engi
neer of highways, was in Tombstone
yesterday inspecting and mapping
out highway work on the state high
ways in and about Tombstone. Mr.
Frazier expects to have the road
camp at Fairbank now, on the Tomb
stone canyon and Santa Rita moun
tains by the 16th of August, sending
half of the camp to each place. He
says surveyors are now locating the
Borderland and Nogales road out of
Patagonia and working toward the
Cocbiso county line.

NEED HELP IN
NUMBERING IF
BISBEE HOUSES
No Crime to Sell
Denatured Alcohol
P. H. Hallach, city engineer, stated
yesterday in regard to the street num
bering proposition which the city
council has authorized, that he has
studied the situation over and has
come to the conclusion that unless the
merchants through the Commercial
club or some other organization take
some interest in the proposed improve
ment and some little financial help is '
forthcoming he does not see where !
he can go ahead with the numbering '
of the streets.
While it Is true that the city coun
cil authorized him to go ahead with
the affair, still they did not provide
any funds for the execution of the
plans, and without some money to de
fray the expenses of a survey for this
improvement he cannot designate the j
numbers. i
Mr. Halleck stated that while some
of the work could be done by the boy
scouts or the high school boys, there
was a lot of preliminary work which
was necessary and which he could
not do without additional help in bis
office. '
It is impossible to correctly number
the houses unless some kind of a sur
vey and map is provided to furnish a
basis for the numbering as well as
keepin ga record of the numbers, so
if the Commercial glub would take au
interest in the street numbering and
assist with some of the financial bur
den, he believed that the plan could
be put through at once. :
