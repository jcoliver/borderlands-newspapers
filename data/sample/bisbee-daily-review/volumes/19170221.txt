NEW YORK, Feb. 20. Follow
ing many clashes between, the
police and women f.fcd rioters at
the City Hall and in congested
tenement district today, Joseph
Hartingan, commissioner of
weights and measures, announced
that he was. doing everything in
his power to stimulate the flow

establishment by congress of some
sort of "food control commission
to meet the per capita consump
tion of food in the United States.''

engry housewives here, the bureau of adoption of an amendment to the con
weights and measures announced that stitution granting woman suffrage.
"the abnormal exportation of food
stuffs and the sub-normal production
are the underlying causes of the ad
vance in prices."
Peddler Are Mobbed.
So desperate have the women in
some parts of the city become, it- is
said, that hundreds of food peddlers
have locked their push carts id
stables and suspended business. A .
number of these dealers who ventured
out "on the upper East Side today were
set upon by a mob of housewives when

at fifteen cents per pound and potatoes I
at nine and ten cents per pound. The J
peddlers were driven from the streets .
into hallways of tenements where the
women tore their clothing and scratch
ed their faces. Meantime, the push
carts were demolished and their con
tents strewn about the streets.
Storm City Hall.
After several hundred women had
stormed the city hall in an effort to
see the mayor, Mrs. Ida Harris, presi
dent of the Mothers' Vigilance League,
issued a statement in which she de
clared it bad been decided to keep
children away from the schools until

Wee Norwegian Maiden Rescued From Sea By German
Submarine Has Thousand Thrills Aboard Sea-Raider
COPENHAGEN, via London. Feb. ;
20. Solveg Jacobsen, the six year old
daughter of a Norwegian shipmaster,
who has arrived here with her par
ents on the way to Norway, has the
distinction of not only being the first
child to make a voyage on a German
submarine, but of being tbe guest dur
ing the eight day trip of the submar
ine commander, who is declared to
have sunk the Lusitania. Solveg's
father, Isaac Jacobsen. was master of
the Norwegian ship Thor II. which
was sunk by the submarine. The U
boat towed the ship's boats with if he
crew of 28 toward land for a while
and finally left them to shift for thetu-
selves, but tbe commander retained
tbe commander, his wife and child on
the submarine while he continued the
cruise.
The operations, however, were of
short duration, for the next ship en
countered proved to be laden with
ammunition for France. The sub-
marine was so shaken by the terrific
explosion when the steamer was tor
pedoed and by an encounter with a
British destroyer, which all but sank
the U-boat by ramming, that one of
its engines was put out of commission
and the commander determined to
make for his home port for repairs.

WASHINGTON, Feb. 20. Final
approval of the naval appropria
tion bill was started today by the.
senate naval committee, with the
total raised to about half a billion
dollars by adding $128,000,000 to
the measure as it passed the
House. Appropriations are car
ried for the coming year's share
of the great three year building
program, and there are various
special provisions, including au
thorization for commandeering of
pi hate shipbuilding and muni
tions plants in time of national
peril.
50 New "Subs-"
The emergency construction appro
priation of $150,000,000 recommended
by the senate sub-committee was re
duced to $115,000,000 with a specific
direction that 6J3(i ol this be
expended by submarines. An amend
ment by Senator Poindexter was
adopted directing that forty of the ad
ditional submeisibles should be coast
vessels and ten fleet submarines, half
ot each type to be built on the Pacific
coast.
The committee also added to
house program three coast guard cut-!

submarines are exposed. Tbe sub-

(By Review Leased Wire)
WASHINGTON, Feb. 2a Pres
ident Wilson is considering break
ing another precedent of more
than a hundred years standing by
not calling the customary special
session of the senate immediate
ly after the beginning of his new

March 4 falls on Sunday, may be

which In a measure would change
entirely the method of ceremon

To Avoid Extra Session
The President's purpose, as under
stood at the Capitol, is to, avoid a spe
cial session unless an extraordinary
session of the whole congress is ne
cessary at the same time. The sen

! custom to confirm appointments of

Say a glass cf hot water with
phosphate before breakfast
keeps Illness away.
This excellent, common-sense
health measure being
adopted by millions.
Thysicians the world over recom
mend the inside bath, claimim; this is
of vastly more importance than out
side cleanliness, because the skin
pores do not absorb impurities inl'j
the blood, causing ill health, while the
pores in the ten yards of bowels do.
Men and women are urged to drink
each morning, before breakfast, a
glass of hot water with a teaspoonful
'jf limestone phosphate in it. as a
harmless means of helping to wash
from the stomach, liver, kidneys and
bowels the previous day's indigestible
material, poisons, sour bile and toxins:
thus cleansing, sweetening and puri
fying the entire alimentary canal be
fore putting more food into the stom
ach. Just as soap and hot water cleanse
and freshen the skin, -j hot water and
limestone' phosphate act on the elini
Inative organs.
Those who wake up with bad breath,
coated tongue, nasty taste or have a
dull, aching head, sallow complexion,
acid stomach: others who are subject
to bilious attacks or Constipation,
should obtain a quarter pound of lime
stone phosphate at the drug store.
This will cost very little but is suffi
cient to demonstrate the value of in
side bathing. Those who continue it
each morning are assured tf pro
nounced results, both in regard to
health and appearance.

tomer, Who Beats a Retreat
Charles Yetter, a barber, is held in
the county jail at Lowell awaiting
trial on a charge of assault as the re
sult of a combination comedy and
tragedy act staged in a barber shop in
th, Xlasan block. Lowell, last Friday.
Anil as a result of the same act. M. A.
Iiuncau has become a linn believer in
the motto; "A good retreat is better
titan a had defeat."
According to the story told to Judge
Winters, Duncan went into the barber
shop to get shaved. Alter having giv
en Duncan's lace a liberal coal ot
lather, it is said, Yetter suddenly
dashed to one side of the shtip and
grabbed a revolver. Without stopping i
to liiul out what the main idea was,'
Duncan jumped from the barber chair
and ran out into the street, while
! other barbers and customers over
' powered Yetter and took the gun away
from him.
! Duncan swore 'jut a complaint for ;
Yetter and the barber was placed in
jail Monday. After talking with him.
Lowell officers have come to the con-'.
elusion that Yetter is mentally un
balanced. He told them that several I
, Lowell residents had been circulating '
i f
; stories attacking his character and I
that he believed Duncan had a hand ,
in the incidents. Later he told a
rambling story of having been robbed

volver. He will probably be taken to
Tombstone soon where county officer
will be asked to examine him as to
his sanity. Duncan told Judge Win j
ters that he had never seen Yetter be-1
fore and others corroborated this
statement. Yetter had in his posses
sion a card stating that he had been
employed by the Philadelphia Rapid
Transit company for ten years and
had left the employ of the company
of his own accord. He is a neat ap

THE I. W. W. MENACE.
Concurrent with the coming of every season the state
of Arizona and its various parts appear to be flooded
with some scourge. Many times It is in the form of some
natural element, destructive of life and property. Man
kind has been unable to cop with nature. The elements
are insurmountable. This year, however, Arizona is
threatened with a menace, at the present time, that is
preventable, and should be subjected to the most stern
treatment. It is I. W. W. 'ism.
Clifton and Morenci had a flight dose of this form of
government, or rather lack of government. Ajo, during
the strike against the Now Cornelia Copper Company,
was subjected to a veneer of the scourge; Jerome is tak
ing steps to combat the evil and, in the meantime.
Chandler, a farming community and the least Industrial
of any subjected to the possibilities of the visitations of
fie organization, comes in for a wholesale treatment on
the subject.
Certainly Arizona needs repair.
Industrial Workers of the World are a menace not only
to society, as a whole, but to every form of the whole.
Union labor, not the least of alL is threatened with com
plete annihilation at the hands of the "Wobbles". This
is due to-the fact that these men can and do join tlw
ranks of decent workers, sincerely interested in the pr'n
ciples of unionism; and, usually, dominate it.
Meantime, the government of 'the state of Arizona
confuses one with the other and being in such a coniii
tion as to be unable to prevent any active measure bein5
taken by the organization, is unable to combat the evil!
With the evil growing at what is an apparently rapid rate
something must be done.
Jerome, from advices reaching. the southern part of
the state, is, literally, taking 'the bull by the horns' and
will forstall any activity on the part of the I. W. W.
Certainly, neither the state of Arizona nor the town of
Jerome desire to have a repetition of what have been
necessary measures, in the past, in various parts of the
state of California. The Golden State was confronted
with a problem which the authorities appeared to be un
able to cope with. The citizens of the various communi
ties, as a consequence, took the question in hand and
elimination was the order of the day. There are many
parts of California where an I. W. W. never appears, and
if he does so Jie is particular not to parade his con
nection and goes about his business as do other people.
Arizona is in its most productive period. All of the
mines, the stock ranches of every kind, the farming sec
tions, the few manufacturing centers and, in short, every
part and parcel of the youngest state, is flourishing. With
internal trouble, with the brand of argument that the
I. W. W. organization brings in its van and with its sub
sequent firebrand activities, any state must suffer.
When any village of a ecmponuent whole is troubled,
either by natural or other causes, this effects the entire
state. At the present time, or at any other time, the
commonwealth can not a.Tord to have its prosperity cast
to the four winds through the desires of those who liav.j
no other interest than to create and propogate trouble of
the worst character.
Let us hope that the slate of Arizona may be spared.
A SOLDIER AND A MAN.
Ilejrauie into the world, unannounced and unheralded ;
his people were j'lst 'folks', yet he leaves this vale with
the sorrowful plaudits of a nation ringing in his ak;'.
The United States joins hands in mourning the death of
a great soldier and a great man in Frederick Funston,
major general of the United States army.
By some l-'unston lias been accused of being an ad

Frederick r'iin:;tn h.is made the most of it. He id
ventured, practically, from the time he was born. He
adventured in college and when it was necessary to make
geologic surveys in Alaska, Funston was the man to l-ad
the expedition. He toured through Alaska before the
gold excitement, when there was no aurean inducement
to beguile men to brave the terrors of the nortii. It wa-
pure adventure which took Funston to the north.
He returned to the United tales, and wli'-ii Hie CuIkiti

The day of the private card game
in Globe i3 fast reaching its end if
the city council has anything to say
about the matter, according to a reso
lution of the city council at its last
meetingT The city's card rooms are
to be abolished. An ordinance has
been drafted, and will be read at the
next meeting prohibiting any pool
hall, soft drink establishment, cigar
stand, tr other public place of busi
ness to maintain private card rooms
for the use of its patrons. The coun
cil also discussed the propriety of al
lowing the club women of the city to
they put. their whele soul into their activity and make
wholesomely good.
Funston was wounded in Cuba and returned to the
United Slates. About that time the Spanish War broke
out and he was made Colonel of the Twentieth Kansas.
With this regiment he went to the Philippines, and made
a record which was envied from one end of the army to
the other. For conspicuous gallantry he was made a
brigadier general of volunteers and when he captured
Aguinaldo he was given the same rank in the regular
army.
The next time Funston came in for general notice was
in 1906 when he handled the policing and visualizing of
the stricken city of San Francisco. To this work he put
all of his humanity and all of his ability. The result
was a resurrected bay city wityhin a few hours after tue
soldiers had taken the situation in hand.
When Victoriana Huerfa insulted the flag of the United indulge in card games which are play-
States Frederick Funston was sent to Vera Cruz. He '! for prizes,
succeeded in excellent measure. It was usual for Fun
ston to succeed and when he led his troops out of the
Mexican coast city even the natives regarded his de
parture. While in charge of the Southern Department of the
United States army the Mexican affair developed in great
intensity and from his station at San Antonio he directed
the Pershing expedition, the following of border raiders
and the protection of the boundaries of the states west
to California.
Funston is known in Arizona. He has visited every
city along the border and by many he is known person
ally. His genial nature, so unlike some soldiers in their
conferences wjth civilians, made him beloved by all. Ho
put the reporters on a new basis. He eliminated the
'war correspondent' but he substituted authentic news.
In saying a word about Frederick Funston the manner
of his wonderful rise can not be overlooked. It is merely
typical of the opportunities in the United States. Many
have said it was clue to 'luck'. Then all who succeed
have luck.
Frederick Funston has lived long; he has lived well
and his great adventure has been great, indeed.
Plans which were formulating for
the promotion f a big carnival for
this city received a death blow last
week when County Attorney Hugh
Foster ruled that under no considera
tion would the preliminary bouts
scheduled for the coining wrestling
match be allowed, let alone a card ot
fights for which admission is paid.
The state law prohibits prize fighting,
but hitheri'j no objection has been
raised to fight cards which were given
ostensibly for no prize, as free at-1
tractions, or as a part of a smoker I
arrangement oy one or more ot ii.e
numerous lodges of the state. The
ruling of Fostor cuts this off in this
county at any rate.

A WAR REFERENDUM.
Mr. L'ryan suggests that the question of war with Ger
many be submitted to a popular referendum. There's no
particular objection tc the plan, so tar as the principle
of It is concerned. It would be a novel procedure, but
tiie mere element of novelty is of no importance. And
certainly our government should not declare war against
Germany or any other country unless the people sanc
tion such a step. We want no government-made or president-made
war.
But hasn'tit occurred to Mr. Bryan that there has al
ready been a referendum? Hasn't there been a continu
ous referendum of our German controversy for the past
two years? Kvery important step taken by our govern
ment in its relations with Germany seems to have been
taken after careful sounding of public opinion, and to
have been indorsed by public opinion after it was taken.'
These steps have proceeded definitely in one direction,
the protection of American rights at all hazards. T'te
people giving utterance to their sentiment through the
newspapers, through public addresses, through their com-
ments on the statements of public men, through elec
tions, through letters and telegrams sent to their repr;
sentatives at Washington, have uniformely indicated their
desire for peace and at the same time their resolution
not to sacrifice vital rights to preserve a cowardly peace.
The attitude of the nation since the recent order of tie! j
German government for us to keep off the seas or be j
blown up has been unmistakable. The nation almc t
with one voice has sanctioned the severance of relations
with Germany, and thereby shown its readiness to fight
if Germany forces us to that lamentable step.
If Mr. Bryan wants a referendum, let iiini suggest it to
the German people. We've had ours.
The state senate has passed Senator
Mah'jney's bill amending the eight
hour law so as to permit working oer
the eight hour limit in case of the
necessary immediate repair of ma
chinery to avoid a shut-down or su
spension of operations. The bill is de
signed to remedy an omission in the
law as originally drawn, and c.')es not
in any way weaken the Existing eight
hour law. The only exception it adds
is in ease of a breakdown to machin
ery which would necessitate a com
plete shutdown for the following two
shifts or until the next day.

THE EXAMPLE OF EDISON.

Not worrying publicly or theatrically over prepared

talking as little as possible and doing as much as pos

American,' Thomas A. Kdison at seventy devoting the en
ergy of his genius to his country gives an inspiring ex
ample! of the best type of patriotism, says the New .York
World.
In his old ugc and in the fulness of as much glory as j
it is given to one man to gain, t.'ie veteran inventor still
captures the imagination of the world, to use the I'resi-
dent's line phrase, atid imbues us with the sam sense of i
magic as when his wizard hand In-gati its work. j
Certain preparedness alarmists, profess to be very
much worried about the pacifist tendencies of the pres
ent generation of Americans. At least we need not des
pair while men of t.'ie Edison type survive from an olde r
-generation. It is to tliem and their followers, and not !o
the professional militarists, that t.'ie country will look

This was the problem that con

A-ard O'Brien yesterday. Mike, not be
ing a supporter of the watchfui wait

with the result that Mr. O'Brien's

O'Brien swore out a complaint charg
ing Kinsella with disturbing the peace.
O'Brien alleged that Kinsella jumped
onto his back and proceeded to ham- j
mer him, in spite of O'Brien's attempts
to buck him off. When tried before
Judye Frank Thomas yesterday after- '
noon Khioi'lht said: "I'll plead guilty,

Kinsella was lired $7.."0, which he

Says Simple Remedy
Prolonged His Life
5R. CALDWELL'S SYRUP PEPSIN
EFFECTIVE AS A REMEDY !
FOR CONSTIPATION.
Among older people the various or
:ans of the b'.idy have a tendency to
low up and weaken, and this is usual
y first manifest in a pronouuet .i in-1
ctivity of the bowels.
Good health is dependent on tegular-!
y in this important function: when
ver there is the slightest indication
f constipation a tr.ild laxative .should
e taken r. relieve the congestion and
'.ispOae of the accumulated waste.
Cathartics or purgatives should cot be
mploycd, however; they are too 1i
ent in action and their effect is onlv
emporary.
A mild laxative such as the c.u
ilnation of simple laxative herbs with
icpsin, knt)n as Dr. Caldwell's Syrup
'epsln, is the ii!ial remedy. It is
:entle in its action, bringing relief in
in easy, natural manner, without grip
ng or other pain or discomfort. Is
)b asant to the taste, and can he oh
alned in any drug : tore.
Mr. IJobert LeKorgee, I I s Kirkwood
loulevard, Davenport, Pa, says he
las alwa;. s had a bottle of Dr. Cald
vell's Syrup Pepsin in the house for
he past eighteen years, and that by
ising it occasionally a-i the need arises.

About Constipation.
Certain articles 'of diet tend to
check movements of the bowels. The
most common of these are cheese, tea
and boiled milk. On the other hand
raw fruits, especially apples and ban
anas, also graham bread and whole
wheat bread promote a movement of
the bowels. When the bowels are
badly constipated, however, the sure
way is to take 'one or two of Cham
berlain's Tablets immediately after
supper. (Advertisement)
