ASSOCIATED PRESS. The great
salient between Soissons and Rheims,
on the Aisne-Marne front, in which
terrific fighting has been going on fcr
two weeks, has been virtually cut out
by the allied forces. French cavalry
patrols now are onerating along the
railroad running between these two
cities, constituting the two pivotal
points of the previous German ad-
vance, American troops hold the out
Bkirts of Fismes, the great supply base
of the German army, which the enemy
strove with utmost strength and de
termination to hold: allied advance
guards have reached the southern
bank of the Aisne, and the force of
the combined thrusts of French, Brit
ish and Americans appears great
enough now to drive the Germans
back even beyond the Aisne to the
heights of the Oherain Des Dames,
where powerful defenses must then
be faced.
Both east and west the allies on Sat
urday increased the speed of their ad
vance a distance of more than six
miles forward being gained at certain
points. The line now has been so
straightened as to escape the danger
which previously threatened the south
ern bend from Soissons from being en
filaded. Notwithstanding the difficulties con
fronting them, the allies are bringing
up their guns almost as fast as the
Germans are withdrawing theirs and
all the roads over which the Germans
are retiring are being subjected to the
heaviest, bombardments.
Coincidently the British have gained
important ground west of the Ancrc j
river where the enemy also is retreat-
ine.
The German armies which have
been fighting a hitter rear euard bat
tle between Soissons and Rheims for
two weeks, have retreated across the
Vasle and are said to be retiring tow
ard the Aisne, across which they
stormed on the night of May 27 in
the first rush of their plunge toward
the Marne. After holding back the
nllies for days along the Ouroq the

En Tardenois.
The allies now hold the line of the
Vesle river from Rheims at least as
far as Braine. Beyond this town the
situation is somewhat obscure but U
is known that the allies are on the
hills overlooking the Vesle vallev to
the west and the northwest. At Ven
izel the allies hold the south bank of
the Aisne and their lines extend west
ward through Soissons to Pommiers.
There is no certaintv that the Ger
mans will find the Aisne a bulwark.
Advices from Paris indicated that the
Germans' lines north of the river are
in a dangerous situation. The retire

WASHINGTON. Aug. 3. Widely
published reports today that General
March, chief of staff, had told the sen
ate military committee General Per
shing estimated that American casua!
ties in the Marne fighting at 12,000
not only grossly misinformed the coun
try, but caused consternation and re
gret among war department officials.
General March denied making any
such statement, and the senators con
firmed his denial. Secretary Baker
also denounced the reports. When the
senator asked General March if ho
had any estimate of casualties in the
Marne fighting he said he had not.
Later in his conference with corre
spondents the chief of staff was
asked:
"Have you any estimate as to the
number ot casualties?"
"None whatever," he replied.
General March and the senators ex
plained he had been asked for total
of casualties reported and had replied
between 12,000 and 14,000. This tikes
no account of the Marne fighting. Gen
eral March's reply was distorted 'nto
representing him as saying General
.Pershing estimated the cost of the
Marne battle at that number.
General Pershing has been unab'e
to estimate the number or being send
ing the names because the wounded
are scattered through French and Bri
tish hospitals and it has been physi
cally impossible to assemble an accu
rate and complete list.

nificant that Paris refrains from ex

interest for every scrap of news.
Particular significance is attributed
by commentators to the crumbling of
the right pivot of the German positions
in the region of Soissons which opens
up great possibilities.
The comment generally dwells or
the fact that this is a real entente vic
tory with French and Scotch forces
under General Mangin, with Amer
icans under General De Goutte and
with English and French troops under
General Berthelot.
Military critics now look for the

establish his line.

WITH THE AMERICAN ARMY ON
THE AISNE-MARNE FRONT. Aug. 3,
10 p. m. (By The Associated Press).
American troops entered the southern
part of the Fismes today, while other
forces of the allies held the southern
banks of the Aisne and Vesle rivers
from Soissons to Fismes.
Eastward It Is almost a straight line
through Courville. Branscourt, Cour
celles and C'hampigny.
The advance of the whole army was
along a front of almost forty-five miles.
To the east of Soissons the exten
sion of the line northward along the
Aisne as well'as the extension of the
general line, makes it probable, in, the
opinion of military experts, that the
Germans will hesitate before concen
trating for a stand along tbe plateau
to the east between the Aisne and the
Vesle, as the branch railroad from Ser
moise to the north now is dominated
by the aliled guns.
The broad field covered by the ad
vance today includes at least fifty
small towns and villages.

WASHINGTON. Aug. 3 The

Maj. Gen. Hunter Liggett, is still
driving at the center of the re
treating German lines and h.
reached Fismes. the enemy's main
base for the Aisne-Mame batt! ?
theater, according to the French
announcement tonight. There wa
every indication the enemy conl l
not halt his ' retirement short o!
the Aisne line. Within a few hour-
today unofficial advices showed
that the whole line had surged
forward to the Alsne-Vesle front
and thrown cavalry patrols b-?-'yond
it.
General March announced General
Pershing now had more than a million
men under his direct command "in his
own area." Presumably he referred to
the section of the front from nor'.h of
Verdun to the Swiss border whcio
American troops have been rapid'.v
taking over the line. The first army
corps, first of the major tactical Amer
ican units to be formed, probably rep
resents the mobile reserve to be con
tributed by General Pershing to ;n-
pooled reserves plan and is counted
as a part of the million men.
There are eight divisions of
Americans, or in the neighbor
hood of 300.000 men now in the
fighting zone where the great bat
tle is going forward and General
March pointed out that General
Liggett had set his headquarter
in the center of the line where his
six divisions are assembled. t-
gether with two additional divi
sions. General Liggett is the firt
American officer to command a
wide section of the front and t.i
his lot has fallen the advance that
has broken the back of the Ger
man effort to halt his line with
in the salient.
General March again described tne
objective of the American and alHed
drive as "the other army." It was ap
parent that he expected it to be p-ess-ed
vigorously and efforv be made to
destroy as much of the crown princ"s
fighting force as possible. He read a
cabled report showing that vast quan
tities of guns, ammunition ami wr.r
material had been captured and the
German dead around Fere En Tanl -
nois captured the ground. The print i
pal portion of General March's state
ment follows:

Mrs. M. E. M. Frantzen , state chair

plan recently adopted of consolidating

this work embraces devastated France.
The task of caring for the refugees
has all :fst doubled this year with the
occupation of hundreds of miles of
French territory in tie three greit
German drives.
As Mrs. Frantzen says, this work
may now well be called French Red
Cross work in general. Her society
cares for French wounded and French
refugees and for American wounded,
too. when they are tarried to French
hospitals, as is often the case.
TIi,, work is well organized nni

Mike Port called, in person yes
terday, upon the newspaper man, to
speak of his troubles, and lately Mike
lias had a plenty of them. Things are
treaking badly for Michael. He is
surely entitled o a shift in the luck.
As was narrated in the Review the
the other day, Mike "had some trouble
with another pilgrim in the district,
and in the excitement of the fray Mike
ran out in the street and was knocked
down by an automobile. As if it were
not enough to have to have a fight
with two men and get chased into the
street and knocked down by a two-ton
car, Mike was fined $10 in police court
I by his honor the judge.
Now, Mike is game. He harbors no
ill will asainst either his adversaries
in the fight, or the man drlvii g the.
big car or the judge with his swift,
stern sentence. But, Mike wants the
whole world to understand that he has
had enough. He does not mean any
jKann by living. He did not start the
fight, he did not intend to block traf
I tic. He had no trouble with the judge,
j But he thinks he ought to be given
an even break nereaiter by both for
tune and the general public and the
officials of the Warren district.
Mike is Russian himself, in spite of
his Irish name, and he is a drafted i
man and ready to go when the call !
comes. But he told the newspaper j
man yesterday, standing at his desk j
with a smile on his face and a bunged !
up nose and a vacuum in his pocket
where $10 used to be, that he did not j
start that fight. "Two men, then ,
jumped on me; they lay for me. I run.
I too fast for them and would escape j
if that car not come and knoek me ,
do-.vn. The doctors at the dispensary
they fix me up and then the Judge
fix me un some more. I sure go get
worst of deal all around."
But Mike can be proud of one thing.
Very few men can fight two men at ,
once and stop a big automobile dead
in its tracks and still work the next j
day. . i

CATTLE DYING FROM
EFFECTS STRANGE
DISEASE
COCHISE COUNTY RANGES VISIT
ED BY MALADY CAUSING HEAVY
LOSSES IN ALL SECTIONS
EYES POP OUT AND ANIMAL
DIES
According to renorts received in
Misbee from niAiierous cattlemen,
many cattle are dying on the ranges
in all parts of the county, due to a
mysterious disease which is said to
affect the eyes, causing death if not
trcatel shortly after infection. Ac
cording to the reports received here,
the disease resembles the pink eye,
although the symptoms are said not
to bp the same. It is reported that
a white scum forms over the eyes of
the stock and if not found immedi
ately the eye swells and bursts, leav
ing the unfortunate beasts to die of
hunger and thirst. One cattleman
near Tombstone is said to have lost
a number of head in this manner be
fore he found the trouble. Dead cat
tle are scattered all over the range,
especially north of Tombstone the re
ports stated from this cause.
Treatment with boric acid, in case
the cow is found immediately after
Infection, will effect a cure, a veterin
ary from New Mexico, who was
brought here especially to cope with
the situation, has found and ha uaa
pronounced it as pink eye.
This is the worst epidemic that has
visited this part of the state since
1904, according to the cattlemen.
The watering places all through;
the valley are strewn with dead cat
tle, including a number of horses, who
have also been affected with the dis
ease. The cattlemen are at a loss to cope
with the situation since an animal will
die within two days if not found and
treated in time after infection.
Watering places are reported to be
drying up due to the scarcity of rain.

Police Round-Up
To Be Started
The city police force has now issued
its final warning about young girls
being on the streets after 10 o'clock.
They will be allowed time to get home
from the picture shows but after that
hour they will be picked up and taken
in charge by the officers. This means
young girls who are not accompanied
by their parents. The parents of the
young girls are subject to arrest i'.i
rase that they do-not take steps to
keep the children in and a few fines
will be added to the city treasury. A
word to the wise is sufficient.
A number of the young girls have
made a habit of hiding out in the back
streets, etc., .but their actions have
been watched and there promises to
be something doing. Parents should
take warning if they do not wish to
see their daughters picked up by the
police and themselves arrested. The
newspapers intend to do their share in
this matter and when arrests are mide
the names of the parents and children
will be published in the police court
proceedings.
GREAT SALIENT IS
CLEARED OF ENEMY
BY ALLIED TROOPS
(Continued from Page One)
Germans are strongly posted on the
hills to the north of the Aisne.
The retreat of the Germans has been
carried out with skill, and, up until
Thursday, seemed to be orderly. Ever
since then there have been no reports
of large captures of prisoners, and
there has been no mention of cap
tured cannon. It Is probable the Ger
man retreat has been a successful op
eration, so far as men and guns may
be concerned. The loss In munitions
and materials will be very heavy.
The success of the allies has appar
ently thrown the whole German plan 1
of campaign out of joint. There have
been large units withdrawn from the
northern battle front to supjHirt the
crown prince's armies and the German
withdrawal across the Ancre 'river
from Albert northward for a distance
of more than three miles is considered
by London to be an indication that the
enemy has abandoned that section of
the Picardy battle field as the scene
of offensive operations. There have
been indications that the British may j
strike the enemy w.'ien the moment !

Pressure! j
After twenty days of battling the allies
still continue their strong pressure upon
the German lines all the way from Soissons
to Rheims. This second battle of the Marne
has upset all calculations upon both sides,
from the most gloomy to the most glorious.
Few of the most ardent of the allied friends
expected to see the offensive last more than
a week. On the other hand there were many
who expected to see the German army
pinched in the allied claw and suffer a dis
aster. But what has really happened to date
was expected by no one.
It seems that Foch has undertaken no
spectacular achievement. He has simply
called in something over a quarter of a mil
lion of his fresh American reserves and a
few picked English divisions and a French
army and set them against the Marne sali
ent like a bulldog against a husky tramp
in the back garden. Day and night the
pressure continues. The Germans retal
iate fiercely at times and at times they re
treat without resistance. Again they re
sort to machine gun defenses and again to
artillery. They have thrown in fresh troops
by the hundreds of thousands and they
have thrown in picked troops by the di
vision. But always the result is the same.
The pressure continues and the German
lines fall back.
Village after village falls to the advanc
ing allies and line after line and wood after
wood and heighth after heighth. And now
Soissons, the anchor post of the German
right flank, has fallen, and still the pres
sure continues on to the eastward of this
most important city. The Tardenois Ville
and the Tardenois Fere, vital flank posi
tions, have both fallen. And so the battle
goes.
That the Germans withdrew their troops
in fair order from the lower part of the
pocket must be admitted, and that they
took away the most of their heavy guns
is a fact also, but they were crowded close
enough to lose hundreds and thousands of
tons of shells and an immense amount of
stores and munitions. And while the allies
hopes of a German disaster have gone glim
mering many times in the past three weeks,
yet there is still hope of just such an ending
to this mighty struggle. The loss of Sois
sons and the caving in of the western side
of the V salient has again endangered the
German lines. They seem to be free of the
pocket, but it seems they will never be free
again of the allied pressure, that deadly
pressure that is now crumpling and under
mining those German lines that struggled
so fiercely against it a few days ago that
every one thought Foch had been stopped
for good.
There is something relentless, mysteri
ous, awesome, terrifying, about this steady
pressure upon the retreating Prussian
hosts. They do say that the German staff
has thrown a million men, all told, within
this pocket, but the pressure of the allies
is the same and the retreat of the Germans
continues after the spasmodic counter at
tack is over.
Last Sunday morning marked a German
withdrawal and a fine allied gain. This
morning marks, after a week of desperate
and frightful effort, & further allied ad
vance upon the heels of the crown prince's
retreating legions. Where it will all end no
one can say. No one is making any pro
phecies right now. Too many prophets,
both the gloomy and the gay, have gone
wrong since July I 5 to encourage any more
predictions. Therefore, let us expect noth
ing and hepe for everything from this ever
lasting, energetic, eternal pressure that
Foch is exerting upon the once proud and
advancing hosts of the Hun.
' Wc repulsed them victoriously all along
the line, yesterday," rend the last German
report on the second battle of the Marne.
Cf course the allies had advanced from two
to five miles along a thirty-five mile front
and taken Soissons, the anchor of the Ger
man right flank, but Berlin "repulsed"
them, just the same. Another German
writer and "explainer" admitted that while
the crown prince's armies had suffered a
strategic reverse yet they had gained a
great victory in that Marne pocket by de
stroying the villages, woods and lands in a
most systematic manner. A victory, after
all, is in the viewpoint.
THE BORGSTROMS
Among the legions of Napoleon at Leip
zig was the grandfather of James Borg
strom of Chicago. ' In 1864, when Ger
many forced her world domination plans
down tKe throats of the Danes, James
Borgstrom's father was fighting tooth and
nail against Germany. But in spite of his
efforts Schleswig-Holstein was gobbled up
by Germany.
In 1 91 4 none appreciated the scheme of
Germany more than did this same James
Borgstrom, and when the United States de
clared a state of war with Germany, Mr.
Borgstrom, according to a Chicago news
paper writer, took his two sons aside and
told them the story of Borgstrom bitter
ness against the kaiser and all things Ger
man. "Your great-grandfather fought them,
but he was alone. Your grandfather fought
them, but he was only one. But there are
two Borgstroms to visit the hate of a hun
dred years upon the head of the kaiser. Go,
my boys, and get him."
And today, a hundred years after the
battles of their great-grandfather, Sergt. L.
J. Borgstrom, 22 years old, is with the
United States infantry, while his brother,
Henry, 20 years old, is a private with the
engineers. When two Borgstroms get to
gether in one big effort, the proud father
declares, the war is as good as won.
A GREAT LITTLE CITY
Belfast is a little town of big undertak
ings. It possesses the biggest plants of
their kind in the world in five distinct in
dustries. It has the biggest shipyard. It
has the biggest tobacco factory. It has the
biggest linen mill. It has the biggest rope
works and the biggest distillery. Pretty
good, isn't it, for a city whose population
last year was only 41 7,000?
Most industrial cities have certain nat
ural advantages. Belfast has none of these.
It has not an ounce of coal or iron within
easy reach, and it has produced a great
shipbuilding industry. Four-fifths of the
flax used in its great linen industry has to
be imported, and all the tobacco used in its
great tobacco factories comes from the
Southern United States. It has not even a
good natural harbor. The town is built
on what is locally known as "slob land,"
which means swamp land, and its harbor
would be silted up with mud in a year if it
were net dredged regularly at great ex
pense. Yet, in spite of all these disadvant
ages, it has succeeded, solely by the grit,
industry and determination of its people,
in building up industries in which it leads
the world.
An idea of the intensity of the struggle
now going on the Marne salient and the
bravery of the American troops in the thick
of these series of battles may be gained
from the story a special correspondent tens
of one company of fifty American soldiers
sent forward to engage the German picked
troops near Sergy, the town that the Yanks
took nine times before they finally suc
ceeded in holding against the Hun. Thi3
company advanced and captured the posi
tion assigned. Then it suffered a counter
attack by overwhelming numbers. Heavy
artillery played ' upon the devoted band.
The officers were killed, one after the other,
until all were down. Then the. men re
maining elected their own leaders and
fought on and held tight. When relief
reached them at last only two men out of
the fifty remained on foot, but they still
held that immortal village street.
"I see by the papers," explained Bill
Slivers to a Kansas editor, as he hitched
one knee over the other to hide a hole in
his overalls, "that King George ain't goin'
to buy any new clothes durin' the rest of
the war. George ain't got anything on me.
I ain't bought any new clothes since this
here war begun. '
The morale of the German army may be
getting low right now but the kaiser is as
strong on morale as ever, else he could
never have had the brazen nerve to write
a letter to that German mother who had
lost all nine of her sons in the war. The
kaiser has six sons, and they are all very
well, thank you.

SEATTLE MAN HAS

Following a request of the highway
department oi the United States gov
ernment to State Engineer U. M. At
wood, at Thoenix, tor a report as tu
prison labor on roads :. Arizona, the
State Engineer, selecting the Disbe--Tombstone
stretch of roadway as an
exampie of such work In the Btate
a report has been made by Engineer
C. W. Douglas, of the local division.
The report is brief, but compreuenr
she, and sets out strikingly the tl it
terence between prison labor under
elficient management as compared
with paid labor. The report follows:
(Uy C. V. Douglas, Ass't Engineer)
The question of results obtained by
the use of convict as against tree or
paid labor on road construction has
teen discussed by engineers and con
struction men at different times, and
has always been quite a difference of
opinion; some maintaining mat uie
cUeap cost of prison labor is off-set
by inefficiency and lack of care in do-
ing work.
The grades and cost data given be
low covering the different phases of
construction of the state highway from
Hisbee to Tombstone in Cochise coun
ty, Arizona, were obtained by an ac
curate and comprehensive system of
cost-keeping iii-titeted by the State
Highway Department as their standard
so that there can be no question as ;o
the accuracy of the figures given.
An arrangement is in effect between
State Engineer I). M. Atwood and the
supervisors of Cochise county where
by all prisoners convicted of misd-j-meanor
acts (violation of the prohibi
tion law, vagrancy, petty larceny, etc.)
a.e turned over the the state highway
department for use on highway con.
struction in this county. The organi
zation in this county that handles
these prisoners under State Engineer
Atwood and Division Engineer R. C.
I'erkins has been built up thoroughly,
and is complete In every detail, and
consists of an assistant engineer and
corps and general foreman with his
underforemen and guards. General
Foreman Chadwick is a man who un
derstands road construction fullv. hav- i
ins had charge of some of the largest !
railroad construction in this country j
ur.d Mexico. He maintains that prison
labor with the necessary expert super
vision is more profitable than free or
paid labor and performs an equal !
amount of work per day. j
The prisoners working at the camp
in this county are for the great ma- j
jority Mexicans. An average of 60
Ier cent are Mexicans, with the re-1
maining percentage being equally di-!
video between white, Americans, and
negroes. The men are housed in -0
by 00 heavy duck tents which accom
modates 50 men in double tiered wood
en bunks. .Mattresses, puluws, and
blankets are provided in sutticieut
quantity to keep each man comfort
able even in the coldest weather. San
itary measures are strictly eniorceu,
ana personal cleanliness Is demanded
of eery man. The food given the
men is of the best quality and sub
stantial, such as fresh meat, fresh veg
etables, potatoes, trijoles, (Mezicau
beans), corn bread, etc., no canned
goods are used except milk. The kit
chen force consists of a prisoner cook
and two assistants, who are required
to be ciean In all ways. All orders or
requests from the U. S. Food Adminis-
tiation are obeyeu and the loreman
sees that there is no waste of food by
men or cooks.
The large bunk house where the
nun sleep is enclosed by a high, close
barbed wire fence. Tne men are re
quired to be in bed by o'clock p. hi.
Large gasoline lamps are used around
the enc.osure to make everything vis
ible for several hundred feet and an
armed guard Is on watch until 6 a.
m., which is arising time, when tney
are turned over to the day guards.
Atier breakfast the men are trans
ported to the ditterent parts of the
work by automobile trucus, arriving
at the works in time to start at 7
o'clock. The several gangs are under
the direction of a foreman with an
armed mounted guard accompanying
him to prevent escapes. Dinner is
brought cut to the works by an auto
mobile truck unless the men are work
ing close to camp. The men work 8
hours per day that being the legal
work-day in Arizona.
The cost per work day per man is
on an average of $1.70, the charges
going into this account are camp costs,
commissary and guarding, and which
also includes clothing, tobacco (smok
ing and chewing, groceries, meat, fuel,
water, kitchen help, saddle horses,
guards, wages and lighting.) Meals
cost on an average of 37c per meal,
which is remarkably cheap consider
ing the high cost of provisions n
this section, and can only be obtained
by keeping a careful watch on com
missary costs and use. .
The Bisbee-Tombstone Highway is
20 feet wide, carefully graded and con
structed as though it were railroad
work. Special attention is given drain
age, owing to the fact of heavy rain
fall at certain seasons of the year
and the country being mountainous, it
has a very quick nn-orf. The grade
is capped with caliche (a lime and
' and earth. Solid rock is moved for
$2.50 per cubic yard. Cost of con
crete used in culverts and bridges is
$12.33.
The last bids by contractors for
this class of work in this section of
whih the writer has personal knowl
edge was 40c for each enbankment,
Tide for excavation and from $15.00 to
$20.00 for concrete. These figures will
show at a glance that convict labor
with skilled supervision will abtain
the same results at a cheaper cost
and the work done will equal in all
respects that done by free or paid
labor.
At this camp the Good Time Sys
tem is in force, and if a man performs
his work well and his conduct is good
he receives two day's credit on his
sentence for each day's work perform
ed. This is an incentive for the pris
oners to do their best, and we know
that a man will work w-ell when he
knows that by so doing his time will
be cut almost in two. If a man be
comes incorrigible, his good time is
taken away and he is given a few
days in solitary confinement on a
diet of bread and water.

In a letter further discussing the
questions opened by Judge A. C. Lock
wocd cf the Cochise county court in a
recent speech in this city, Capt. L. P.
Goode, Thirty-fifth infantry, command
ing Company L, stationed at Lowell,
says :
Headquarters U. S. Troops,
Lowell, Ariz., July 30, 1U1S.
Editor Bisbee Daily Review,
Bisbee, Arizona,
Dear Sir:
In replying to Judge Lockwood's
letter published in -your paper on July
27. 1918. will state that I agree with
him in part. . I have always been op- j standpoint.
pased and iave discouraged the un
restrained association of. young girls
o 12 to 1C, or even 18 years of age
for that matter, with young men but
little older. Such associations can
mean but little if any good, and if un
checked, almost invariably lead to
evil. I had sn opportunity recently to
meet with a group of your teachers in
the discussion of this vital question.
From their discussion in which, parts'
of Judge Lockwood's speech were
quoted, it seems that the military au
thorities are to blame for these things
ies which ravaged e,uiic ... mc mid
dle ages by our present moral codes
or standards. We have ceased to
judge men by the standards of anoth
er age. Neither' can we judge li-o
soldiers of thirty years ago v what
we consider a man should meagre up
to today.
Quite true there are nio-e coil-go
men in the armv now than thi-n. 'I hat
I do not deny. Hut what were ihe- id
eational demands of the general pub
lic of 1S90-1900? I wonder 'low the
percentage of men who have a college
education today compared wi'li these
who completed the grammar grides in
1900. Not so unfavorably I should think.
I am not speaking in the terms ot
Cochise county, understand, for I know
but little of its educational history, but
what did it offer in its schools then?
Compare with today.
If we compare the character and
moral standards of our army today
with that of yesterday let us not forget
to compare the character and m-irals
of our communities today, with tint
before degrading influences r.nd plai es
of vice were-driven from our cities.
Such things. 1 do not like to recall,
but we cannot erase those black spots
from the pages of our, history by re
flecting upou an organization which
had to live through it all.
Compare the recent legislative ac
tion prohibiting such things with tne
attitude of legislative bodies in the
past, which represented the public
frame of mind. Compare the recrea
tions and amusements furnished to
our old protessional army and the i
vironnient of our army camps and
army posts then, with our motion
pictures, recreation and amusement
halls, hostess and community ho::ses,
and homes open to the men in khaki
furnished now through the work of th :
Red Cross, Y. M. C. A., and similar in
stitutions, to say nothing of the ex
termination of vice in the eiUej adja
cent to our camps.
Judge Lockwood gave soive terms
of the old enlistment hut failed tj give
them all. The following terun weie
in etfect until the increase of our army
during the recent Mexican trouble. .
1. An applicant for enlistment mu.-t
pass ?. rigid physical examination.
2 Must be a naturalized citizen.
3. Must furnish three letters :f
recommendations from responsible
persons as to his character, mental
and moral fitness.
4. Must be able to read and wriie.
5. Show their willingness to serve
their country from a pure patiiotic
child. Her color is Wearing up and
him is unit- to do ail her houseful!;
it bout any trouble.

"Tanlac lias not only made a won
derful change in my wife, but 1 have

and now she let Is fine all the time
And as for myself, I have picked up
twenty-five pounds, and never Ie!t be'.
ter in my life."
This Interesting and remarkable
statement was made by I. O. Bland ol
W ashington, recently.
Continuing Mr. iJland said: "My
wife has had one of the worst cases of
stomach trouble, it seems to me a per
son could have, and everything she
would eat disagreed with her in a way
that caused her the greatest of suffer
ing. Hilling tne past five years we
tried everything we heard of in our
fforts to help her and buiid her imi.
Lut nothing seemed to do her any
goou. Her app"tiie lelt her ei.tireiy.
her complexion '.vas sallow , and iiv
health was all gone to pieces, rihe used
to weigh one hundred and seventy
pounds, but fell otf to one hundred
olid thirty-three and wi's so weak she
could hardly raise her arms. For oil1:
solid month heft re she began taking
Tanlac, she was ilmvn in bed. hardly
able to move.
"About ;he last of April she started
on Tanlac, and the results have been
wonderf'il. She has no trouble wh :
ever with her stomach now. She eats
anything she wants without tutfering
a particle fiom it, and has a spli n.liu
appetite. She was so nervous and mis.
erable before she began taking Tan
lac sue hardly knew what a goo!
night's sleep was, but now she sleeps
the whole night through just like a
panicle wiih iiuigestion now, no ma ter
v. hat I eat. and 1 am aiways na'h
v. ith a big, appetite when nual time
comes I now weigh cue hundred anl
sixty-seven pounds, making a gain of
twt-nty-five pounds, and my vtile and
I are both glad to recommend Tanlac,
it has done far more than we ever
expected of it."

Compare the above if you rler.sa.
with the following which necessity
forces us to accept along with college
and technically trained men:
1. Men with all kinds of physical
weaknesses and disabilities.
2. Foieigners, some without even
first papers.
3. Those mentally weak and quali
fied for limited service only.
4. Illiterates. (Compare the per
centage of this class in the army now
nince 1916 with that before.)
5. Conscientious objectors, slackers
which occur, because of few men in
uniform have become involved. As in
the past the man in uniform being
more conspicuous is singled out as the
principal offender and every soldier is
apparently judged accordingly.
The solution to this problem is as
Judge Lockwood suggested in his
speech.. It rests almost wholly with
the influences of the home. Proper
training in the home instead of an at
titude of indifference on the part oi
parents whose girls are on the streets
will answer the problem when all else
fails.
Relative to the remainder of Judge
Lockwood's letter I beg to disagree.
Le6t some should mistake my mean
ing let me say here that my remarks
and other undesirables.
in conclusion let me state I am nor
accustomed in criticizing speeches, to
take isolated sentences and disregard
tne remainder, but the statement
quated was so bold an assertion tint
at this time I did not consider it!
meaning could be mistaken even
though the speech was made to an au
dience of women. Why throw bouquets
at women who have relatives in the
service today at the discredit of the
women of the past who felt the same
as those do now? Both should be re
spected and honored but not one at
the expense of the other. I. still feel
that lam justified in my criticism of

To Our Subscribers
Ov.ing to increased cost of labor, materials, and everything con
nected with the newspaper business The Review has found it neces
sary to discontinue the practice of having the route carriers collect
subscription accounts.
f This practice was unsatisfactory and inefficient as mislr.kes were
frequent and the results of this system were unsatisfactory both to the
subscriber and the paper.
f Therefore: We request that all subscription accounts be paid direct
to the business office of The Review. This will e'iminats r. large
source of error and we are suro the benefit derived from this course
will be mutual.
Subscriptions not paid in a reasonable length of time will be dis
continued. Cj V. e will appreciate jour cooperation in our effortj to ric you the

1. Store gasoline in underground
steel tanks.
2. Use measuring pump and
They prevent loss by tire, evaporation
and spilling.
3. Don't spill cr expose gasoline to
air it evaporates rapidly and is
dangerous.
4. Don't use gasoline for cleaning
and washing use kerosene or other
materials to cut grease.
5. Stop all gasoline leakage. Form
a habit of shutting oil" gas at tank or
feed pipe.
6. Adjust brake bands so t'uey do
not drag. See that all bearings run
freely.
7. Don't let the engine run when
car is standing. It is good for starter
to be used frequently.
8. Have carburetors adjusted at
service stations of carburetor or auto
mobile companies they will mike or
dinary adjustments without charge.
9. Keep needle valve clean and ad
just carburetor (while engine is hnt)
lo use as lean a mixture ts possible.
A rich mixture fouls the engine and is
wasteful.
10. Preheat air entering carburetor
and keep radiator cjvered in cold
weather t iis will insure better vapor
ization. 11. See that spark is limed correct
ly with engine and drio wiih spark
fully advanced a late spark increases
gas consumption.
12. Have a hot spark, keep plugs
clean and tpark points propertly ad
justed. 13. Avoid high speed. The average
car is most economical at fifteen to
twenty-li miles an hour.
14. Don't accelerate and stop quick
ly it wastes gas and vears out tires.
Stop engine and coats long hills.
15. Cut down aimless and needles
use of cars. Do a number of errands
in one trip.
16. Know your mileage per g.i'.Io:;.

PROPAGANDA
PLAUSIBLE ATTACKS HADE ON
METAL MEN BOSTON DEDUCTION
Figure Juggling is Begun by Well Meaning Folk Both to Bull
and Bear Market, While Confusion and Perversion of
Real Facts is Evident in Charges Tending to Show Copper
Men Holding Stocks in Effort to Mulct Government
BOSTON. Mass., Aug. 3. Juggling of copper production and profits
figures for 1917 as reported by the Federal Trade Commission and thr.uigii
ether sources is now in vogue. Encaged in llie activity are almost as many
and varied interests as occupied themselves with attacks upon th- meat
industry because of the commission report, until the unfairness of the latter
was established and the public settled down to the conviction that 1 cent
profit on every dollar's worth of meat sold by the packers was sufficiently
modest.
Some well meaning persons have used 1917 figures to stiffen arguments,
and incidentally the share markets, as to the exceptional attractiveness of the
coppers from the investment and speculative standpoints. Another variety
is making use of the same figures to bear the market, pointing to exaggerated
deductions as assuring that the government will have to commandeer the
mines or put on such increased restrictions that at the end of the war they
will be stranded wrecks.
Close neighbors to tills latter class are German propagandists who are
responsible for deductions alleged to show that the copper producers have
been falling behind with output of the metal for the purpose of forcing the
government's hand for a higher price. The object is to make dissatisfaction
among investors, encourage hounding and discouragement of the producers
by legislators and commissions and to make trouble at the mines through
creation of the belief among the men that their employers are not toting
fairly to them or the government.
Except as to the work of the German propagandists, threads of excuse
exist for the exaggerations of the other jugglers of figures, who failed to
dissect the statistics used and evolved half truths. The whole truth is be
twixt and between their extremes.
The German propaganda is a different matter and palpably a perversion
of figures. Among the latter the propaganda puts special stress upon the
alleged fact that while the total 1917 production of copper, according to
federal figures, was but 41.000,000 less than the production of 1916. copper
sales were 100,000,000 pounds less than in 1916. The argument attending is
that the copper producers held up their stocks in an attempt to mulct 'the
government for a higher price.
It is a well established fact in east-l
ern metal circles and in government earning possibilities of the properties
circles that the "holding up" was done I faster than the increased earnings
by the government: that federal em-
bargoes upon shipments of various
kinds over the railroads during the
last quarter of 1917 reached copper
among other things and that practical
ly every smelter yard in the west
carried large stocks of copper which
could not be shipped during that peri
od. At the same time copper was
sidetracked all the way from Seattle
to New York while priority materials
occupied the main lines. The em
bargo loosened only when the need of
copper for immediate war contract
uses became desperate.
While copper was kept out of ship
ment in the last quarter of 1917 it
was necessarily kept out of sale, and
the remarkable thing is that in con
nection with belated deliveries on con
tracts held by producers who were
kept out of production during the sum
mer and fall by strikes and were ablo
to get only a small part of the actual
smelter production during the last
quarter of the year through the refin
eries and recorded as sales, the dis
parity between the record of sales
and of production was not vastly
greater. Another thing is that while
10n.000.000 pounds of copper looks
large when set by itself, it is as a
matter of fact no great item in the
total annual production. Arizona alone
produces more than two-thirds of the
much emphasized hundred million
pounds each month when going nor
mal. With reference to copper profits,
the Federal Trade Commission report
says: "The average profit was 2i.4r',.
Probably over 70'; of the production
is marketed at profits over 200 on
investment. These same companies
show an average profit of only 11.7'v
in 1913, which may he considered to
be a normal year. Thus the average
profit in the industry has more than
doubled." In the copper share and
metal circles it is remembered that
1913 was not an average year. Metal
prices were low and money very dif
ficult to secure for copper enterprises,
because investors have always figured
that the risks incurred, the fluctua
tions in price and the attendance of
constant necessity for large expendit
ures for development and additional
equipment, entitle them to at least
15',v on their money after the period
of from three to six years, and often
more, during which they have to wait
for return of any kind from money put
into a raw- property.
While the government report show
that 1917 profits were more than dou
ble those earned in 1913, it is to be
remembered that risks have multiplied
and money is far higher since 1913. A
much more important fact escaping
general observation is that under
pressure of war.
combating strikes i
influenced by the German propaganda ' at the same time gives a clear and
which has assailed all war industries valuable statement of the results
in the country, overcoming shortage sought and how obtained and which
of technical men. mechanics and other incidentally places Douglas properly
skilled operatives who have been in the fore front in smelter advance
drawn into the war as volunteers or ment. The letter follows:

WRITES LETTER
Tells of Big Gain in Reverber
atory furnaces made by
Modern Plant at Douglas in
Daily Output
Endeavor to get more from raw ma
terials and at the same time reduce
the expenditures of labor, time and
supplies required in treatment has
been general among all industries dur
ing the war. but in none have more
highly organized and earnest staffs
worked to this end than in mining,
milling and smelting in Arizona and
in none has there probably been as
wide a range of general advance.
These achievements have been In
dicated from time to time in reports of
increased results being obtained at
various plants within the state, not a
one of which but has achieved higher
efficiency in its practice since the
war. One of the most important,
which is finding copying throughout
the smelting industry with result of
large saving of fuel, has been broueht
Into prominence because of some dis
cussion as to the place of origination
of the improvement. A letter recently
issued by Superintendent Harry A
Clark of the Calumet Arizona smel

Scientific I'ress, settles this point and
WORKERS START TO
REPAIR GREAT
SMOKE STACK
IN ORDER TO RE-RIVET BIG CHIM
NEY AT PHELPS-DODGE POWER
HOUSE, BLOWER FROM DAW
SON MINES IS INSTALLED TO
CARRY AWAY SMOKE
One cf the most unique pieces of
repair wcrk undertaken in mining cir
cles in this district for many a day
is the re-riveting of the huge smoke
stack at the Phelps Dodge power
house, preliminary arrangements for
which now are well underway. Though
rrdinarily the smoke from a battery
of boilers would he going up this
great flue, a way has been found to
prevent this, while at the same tim
cperaticn cf the power plant remains
uninterrupted. Soon the stack will
be in good repair and will be thrown
into use as before.
A short time since it was discovered
that fumes passing through the stack
had made serious encroachments upon
the rivets in the big steel tube, and
while it was not in a precarious con
dition, there was danger that if al
lowed to go cm too long without rem
edy, a very heavy repair bill would
have to be met.
Several problems had to be solved
before the work could proceed, the
chief of these being to repair the
stack without closing down the power
plant" for a time, at least. In order
to do this a large blower which woulc!
afford the proper draft was brought
here from the coal mines at Dawson,
X. M. This was connected with one
end of the draft chamber, at the rear
of the boilers, last Sunday. The stack
then was floored with eye beams and
earth so as to make it "smoke tight."
The scaffolding on which the iron
workers will stand while riveting then
was put in place and shortly will
reach the top of the stack, when actu
al repair work will be started.
As soon as the repair has been made
the boilers will be closed down for a
few hours, the floor removed from the
stack, the blower removed frcm the
end of the draft chamber, which then
can be sealed. In the meantime, smoke
will rcil out the end of the draft cham
ber instead of through the stack as
it normally does, which circumstance
doubtless will arouse considerable
curiosity among the people of the dis
trict who do not know the nature of
the repair being done.
smeltery, at Douglas. The Copper
Queen plant here has never approach
ed these figures In tonnage with the
same sized furnaces. Consequently,
H. H. Stout, now superintendent of the
Copper Queen plant, working with the
object of increasing tonnage, decided
to enlarge the size of the reverbera
tory uptake at the Copper Queen
plant from 33 sq. ft. to SO sq. ft. outlet,
on account of the low draft in the up
take of his furnaces. The result was
that there w-as an increase in furnace
tons per day from approximately 350
to 600. The increased area of outlet
reduced the gas velocity from 75 ft.
per second to 40 ft. per second. After
the furnaces had been in operation
about three weeks, the front and up
take burned down, on account of not
having control of the fire zone.
At this time I increased the uptakes
on the furnaces at the Calumet & Ari
zona plant from 30 sq. ft. to 70 sq. ft.
outlet, which augmented the furnace
capacities from 400 to 650 tons per
day. With the benefit of Mr. Stout's
experience with his front and uptake,
we started experiments with the con
trol of the smelting zone by the ad
mission or non-admission of air
through dampers at the burner holes,
with the result that our outpost was
increased to over 900 tons per furnace
day. This enormous gain over the
old operation was accomplished by be
ing able to burn 200 additional bbls.
of oil or a total of 500 per day in the
same furnace, when previously it was
possible to burn only 300 bbls. per day.
The combustion and the control of the
fire zone by dampers was perfect, con
fining combustion to the first 30 ft.
of furnace and preventing the flames
from carrying through to the front or
uptake end, as had happened before,
with disastrous results to the brick.
Of the total charge. 92'; is delivered
in the first 30 ft. of furnace; the re
mainder is for protection of side walls
only. All material is side charged
The temperature at the fronts is from
2300 degrees F. to 2400 degrees F., or
the same as when the fire zone was
not under control. Another point not
to be overlooked is the conservation
of heat in the calcines between the
roasters and the reverberatories. We
have always watched this point care
fully, and it is a vital consideration
when dealing with large furnace ton
nages and aiming at fuel economy.

HEAVY FLOW STRUCK
ON UPPER LEVEL
OF SILVER BEAR MINE
A most peculiar circumstance in
the recent development operations
of the Phelps Dodge properties here
was the striking of the so heavy a
flow cf water in a drift on the 600
foot level of the Silver Bear mine
that it was found necessary to pipe
it down to lower levels in order to
keep the stopes from getting water
soaked and heavy. It is particular
ly strange in view of the fact that
very little water has been struck
in the lower levels, the 800 and 900
levels being practically dry.

to do with the control of the fire zone,
for the reason that one is compelled
to burn approximately 500 bhls. of oil
to smelt Suit or 900 tons of ore; if the
oil supplv is reduced slightly the ton
nage will be reduced three to one;
and consequently the oil ratio will go
up. as nearly all the smelting Is done

JULY TONNAGE
HIGHER THAN
THATOF JUNE
Manganese Shipments Show
Increase .J Also; Southwest
Ore Body Continues to
Open Out
The tonnage made by the mines of
the Phelps Dodge corporation liere
during July was somewhat higher
than that of June and the production
of copper from the smelter at Doug
las proportionately greater. It is
probahle that August production also
will be heavy though many things
may intervene between now and the
end of the month to cause some dimin-
lution in the proposed output.
A far heavier tonnage of mangan
ese ore was extracted from the P. D.
properties during July than in June.
Great Ore Body Opens
With continuation of development
work, the Southwest ore body which
was struck about a year ago is show-
ing increased size. It now is consid
ered by the company to be very large
and most valuable ore body, far be
yond the expectations of anyone con
nected with the company here even
a few months or weeks ago.
Speeding Sacramento Hill Work
Much more rapid progress is being
made in the removal of the big iron
dike which formerly crowned Sacra
mento hill, with each shift. It now
is anticipated that the top will be off
the hill and steam shovel operations
can be started by the 15th or 20th at
the latest.

EXCELLENT CONDITION NOW
Last Dividends, Paid July 20, Amounted to 25 Cents Regular
and 25 Cents Extra Per Share, Totaling $175,000; Net
Cost Per Pound of Refined Copper Less Than 14 Cents;
Copper Production Was Lower Than Previous Quarter
Following almost immediately upon the heels of the. payment of a regular
quarterly dividend of 25 cents and a special dividend of eiual amount, made
July 20. on stock of record June 29. the quarterly report of the Shattuck
Arizona Copper Company was made public by .Norman E. '-a.Mond. vice
president. It shows t-'iat while the company's production of copper was less
than in the previous quarter, this was accountable to the fact that a lower
grade of ore was being worked. However, costs are being held down to less
than 14 cents per pound cf refined copper, and almost four thousand fee
of new development work has been done.
The report in detail follows:
To the Stockholders of SHATTl'CK ARIZONA COPPER COMPAXY:
The following is a report of the results of operations for the Quarter
ending June l!0th. 191S:
DEVELOPMENT
The total development work for the Quarter was 3.957 feet, as follows:
Drifts 3.249 feet
Raises 708 "
Total 3.957 "
We continue to open up small extensions of good ore around old sloping
areas. New work has been performed on all mine levels between the 100
and 900-foot levels. The important finds of the quarter were made between
the 800 and 900-foot levels in intermediate level work from three raises,
developing a large tonnage of massive sulphide ores assaying between 2'r
and 7' copper. Small ore bodies have been found in new ground being
developed from raises above the 9"0-foot level. A small lense of high grade
copper carbonate ore was encountered in a crosscut on the 300-foot level
and is now being developed.
A considerable amount of new work is being done to put the low grade
lead deposits in shape for cheap extraction. A section of this ore lying on
the 200-foot level and above, will be sent to the milling plant first. The new
work has exposed ore well up to the average in lead and silver.
Ore extraction is still being delayed by a shortage of experienced labor.
PRODUCTION AND COSTS
The following is a summary of the mine and smelter production and or
operating costs for the Quarter: L.
Copper Ore Lead Or
Dry Tons Ore Mined 24,123 1.635
Dry Tons Ore Shipped 24,430 1.470
Dry Tons Ore Smelted 24.430 529

Total Pounds Lead Recovered 227.294
Gross Operating Cost per lb. Refined Copper 16.389c
Less Operating Credits - - 2.600
Net Operating Cost per lb. Refined Copper 13.789c.
There was about the same tonnage mined and smelted as in the previous
quarter and the less production of copper was due to the lower grade of ore.
However, the gold and silver recoveries per ton increased and resulted in
the greater production of these metals. .
The construction of the lead ore concentrator is sufficiently finished to
allow milling to benin early next month.
REFINING AND MARKETING
There were deliverable from the refinery during the quarter 2.5S1.931
pounds of copper. Delivery of all of this copper was applied against old
.'ontracts or on government requisitions except 2S2.61S pounds which is still
unsold. T T"rWJfWWi
There are 2.997.2S5 pounds of copper in transit to the refinery, all unsold.

accomplished in the six headings be
ing run.
Since July loth, two new headings
have been started, both of which ex
pose conditions which are more than
premising. No. 5 was started at a
point west of the shaft and on the
south side of the station and runs
south. It is following a well miner
alized lead showing an abundance of
chalcopyrites and pyrite. The forma -
tion is a sheared schist and the head
ing has now advanced 14 feet.
No. 6, also new, was started off from
No'. 1 at a point where the latter turn
ed toward the east and has advanced
11 feet in a southerly direction. Here
the mineralization is also intense. A
raise will be started in No. 6 for the
purpose of prospecting the upward
trend of the ere and with the view ot
determining the exact dip of the min
eralized streaks and their continuity.
The following work has been accom
plished in the other headings:
No. 1, the soufheast drift and now
running more easterly Total advance
of 48 feet. Formation, a well mineral
ized schist.
No. 2. the west drift Total of 27
feet. Work was resumed in this head
ing last week, and with good results.
for at a slight advance a well-defined
contact was encountered showing a
footwall of diorite, porphyry on the
hanging wall side, between which lies
a soft schist gouge, the latter showing
chlorinization. The contact appears
to have a northeasterly and southwest
erly course and is now being followed.
No. 3. the crosscut being driven to
intersect the No. 13 quartz ledge which
was exposed on the 700 level, has ad
vanced a total of 76 feet. The face
shows a schist with stringers of quartz
running through the formation.
A very favorable condition is also
exposed in No. 4. running north from
the west side of the station. A good
looking quarti was cut in this head
ing and the face of the crosscut is
now entirely in the quartz. It is pos
sible that this formation may be the
wall of an ore body which has its ori
gin in the No. 13 ledge.
Summing up the conditions at Verde
Combination, it may be said that the
indications for the opening up of a
well defined ore body are very favor
able, the chances being strengthened
by the continued showing of mineral
in the headings being worjeed and the
high-grade chalcopyrite which was
cut in the sump.
Oil account of the fact that No. 13
was encountered as a blind ledge or
the 700 level and therefore no exact
knowledge of its downward trend has
been revealed, it is next to impossible
to prophesy its distance from the bot
tom of the shaft at the present depth.
Green Monster
With the visit of President W. S.
Humbert and Director W. W. Lawhon
to the Green Monster properties last
week came the announcement of the
temporary cessation of development
work in the Gorge Tunnel. Some
months ago the Gorge Tunnel cut
through a body of low grade chalcopy
rite which proved to be about 90 by
100 feet in size. At the outer edge of
this crebody a winze was sunk to a
depth of 100 feet and passed out of
the ore. A crosscut was then run
back 100 feet under the pyritlc? zone
and a raise driven for the purpose of
determining the dip of the mineralized
formation. The work done so far has
revealed the fact Uiat this orebody
lays rather flat, and for that reason
it was decided to discontinue work at
this point for the present. Later it
is planned to thoroughly prospect the
Gorge Tunnel workings by vertical dia
mond drill holes.
In the meantime work will be con
centrated in Ifie sinking of the Doro
thy May shaft. The shaft has passed
through some very good schist and the
formation is now getting a trifle hard
er, although it is not a diorite The
present depth is 765 feet, and the shaft
will be continued to the 1000 level un
less tlie white intrusive exposed In
the crosscut from the 50 level is en
countered at less depth, in which case
it will be followed and prospected.
There is no water in the bottom of
the shaft, and in case a flow is struck,
it is the intention to pump to the sump
on the 500 level and lift the same
from there up with the equipment al
ready installed at that point.
It is estimated that from now on
supplies, labor, etc.. will total in the
neighborhood cf $7,000 per month as
against $10,000 heretofore spent and
that the company should have a bal
ance on hanti of $100,000 after the
1000 foot level is reached in the Dor-
othy May shaft. It will not be nects-j
sary to purchase any additional equip
ment. Since cutting out the work in the
Gorge Tunnel a force of 24 men is be
ing employed.
Gadsden
Tim large three-compHrtnient shaft
at the Gadsden is now down 1142 feet
and Isj in a composite foimation of
quartz-porphyry, quartz, jasper and
schist, with a diorite just showing up
in the l.ottom of the shaft. Much ot
the rock shows evidences of mineral
izatirn in the form of hematite, while
there are a number of well mineral
ized streaks of quartz in which the
iron is quite strong. The wor oi ;

Mining and Financial News
BY REVIEW
NEW YORK, Aug. 3. The hollow
character of today's stock market may
be guaged from the fact that trans
ections in the two hours of the ses
sion barely touched 70,000 shares.
Of this meager total. United States
steel furnished about thirty per cent
relinquishing its half point gain at
the close. . Tool perpetrated a new
drive against the shorts in General
Motors at an extreme advance of
points.
Rails were dull to the point of ex
tinction, but a few specialties, such
as tobaccos, oils, coppers and issues
of no definite description gained one
to two points.
The bank statement threw no light
on the week's heavy financial opera
tions, actual loans showing only a
naminal increase, while actual excess
leserves decreased by slightly more
than $17,000,000. Bonds were steady;
Liberty 34's again reached par, al
though succeeding issues eased slight
ly. Total sales, par value, were $2f
800,000. Old United States bonds were
unaltered on call during the week.
WEEKLY FINANCIAL REVIEW
NEW YORK. Aug. 3. Stagnation
was the overshadowing feature of the
week in the stock market, operations
falling to the smallest total of the
year. Prices were firm in the main.
Taxation and the policy of the gov
ernment toward railroads again consti
tuted the principal couses which madej
for restraint. Reports that the admin
istration may soon announre a sched
ule of war taxes ranging from sixty
to eighty per cent were current.
Transportation shares were Irregu
lar or heavy, when at a'l quoted. The
inspiring war news erved to effect a
measure of equilibrium together with
the extremely favorable querterly
statement of the United States Steel
corporation and the good annual re
port of the Southern Pacific company.
In neither case, however, was there
more than languid response. Activity
of pools diminished visibly. Call
money was nominally lower, actually
holding at the long continued rates of
five to six per cent. Time funds were
limited to renewal of loans for small
amounts, all of six per cent.
Foreign exchange has become mere
ly perfunctory by reason of an exten
sion of international regulation.
CLEARING HOUSE STATEMENT
NEW YORK. Aug. 3. The actual
condition of clearing house banks and
trust companies for the week shows
that they hold $05.22.190 reserve in
excess of legal requirements. This
is a decrease of $17,151,520 from last

CHICAGO. Aug. 3. Aithpiclouj war

about nearly coiltinuous downturns to

(and 1 can understand how they love

She also tells of their new Y build

upon whose property General Grant

Oistration. r Seen in the Shops
! In planning the summer wardrobe
i of former seasons the well-dressed
woman usually included one dark
! frock for shopping trips to town. But
in this year when war work comes
i first and last and in between times,
ia woman has as much need for her
jtown frocks as for organdie and mull
'and calico. Crepe de Chine is probab
jly the most practical for gowns of
this kind as it is cool and washes well
One of soft pale grey, which has come
to be one of the standard colors of
summer is made youthfully, yet with
sufficient dignity to appeal to the old
er woman. Narrow cordings are used
as a finish for the well shaped collar
jand repeated many times on the tunic.
and self colored buttons are used as
a trimming-. The cording on the skirt
overcomes the objection that is often
made to crepe de chine in that it
gives a little Dody ana prevents u
from clinging to close to the figure.
Another made of this same material
is less tailored but equally well fin
ished, in either beige, navy blue, flesh
color or white. Buttons covered with
material edge the gracefully cut col
lar and the side draperies the latter
give the effect of an apron in the back.
A tiny vestee made of flesh colored
Georgette makes a stunning finish.
A froc k of dark blue cotton voile Is
made with plaited frills of the materi
al on the turn-back collar and cuffs
and on each side of the bib-like front
of the blouse. The skirt is amply full
and has groupings of narrow tucks.
A. proper hat to be worn with this
frock is of purple hinoke straw a
Japanese straw which is most effec
tive for sport hats. A grosgrain rib
bon encircles the'erown and binds the
edce of the brim.
When one is sixteen or seventeen
and is just stepping into the land of
dreams, by way of a dinner or a dance
a frock made o Georgette as blue as
the skys of Switzerland, over taffeta
as rosy as a dream, and as simple and
youthful as its wearer, for its only
trimmings are the pleated ruffles of
Georgette and a sash of blue grosgrain
ribbon faced with silver.
