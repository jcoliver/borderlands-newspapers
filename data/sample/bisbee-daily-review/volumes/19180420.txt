ment Rained on Village by
Enemy; Assaults Made on
Canal Very Costly
WITH THE BRITISH ARMY IN
FRANCE. April 19. ( By the Associated
Press! Along the northern battle
front at noon today the eUrmans were
still resting on their arms after the
hitter defeat which they suffered yes
terday in their great drive. L'p to that
hour they had not recovered suffici
ently to make any further threats in
this line and they were rushing the
reorganization of their badly hani
mei forces.
Each successive report gives further
confirmation of the terrific losses sus
tained by the assaulting infantry dur
ing yeterday's sanguinary struggle. Be
tween Givenchy and Festubert the
ground this morning was strewn with
cGrman dead and at many other points
on the long front of action excessive
casualties were inflicted by the Britis
artillery and machine gun fire which
mowed down the unhappy storm troops
in countless numbers.
Terrible Execution
The British machine gunners work
ed their weapons in many cases until
the cr.emy was only 50 yards away.
Thcie was no chance of missing these
point blank targets. Time and again
the enemy line wavered and fell back,
unable to withstand the deluge of bul
lets and where they succeeded in get
ting tlosequarters they left a heavy
trail of dead and dying behind.
The British trench mortars also did
gre;: execution, threwing their high
explosives into dense enemy ranks at
clc.:;e range.
Tne German artillery bombardment
about Givenchy arid from La Bassee
northward along the canal, yesterday
morning perhaps set a new high water
mar for intensity. Veterans of many
battles declared they had never seen
auytung like it. although many rec
ords have been broken since the of
fensive began March 21.
It was the eGraian intention to wipe
Givenchy off the map. and in order to
accci'iplish this they increased three
fold their already great concentration
of sit'llery. Guns of all calibers, up
to 11 Inch monsters, took part in the
preliminary bombardment, and con
tinued throughout the day to hurl
thousands of shells into the back
areas I'ndoubledly this lombard
nten: did much damage, but this morn-
ng all the eGrmans had to show for
tnej. ejpenilitUre of
sul)sv,minMy their 8a
ammunition, and
sacrifice of life, was
one hit of a forward trench at Given
chy ai.d one little outpost at Festu
bert. where a small camp of British
fought to the last man before the en
emy was able to get. In.
Attack in Wave
The German infantry kept surging
forward in waves all day about Given
chy, and northwest to Festubert. and
the fighting was most desperate. At
jsule of the town, but a vigorous count
er atiack bv the British forced them
out i-uain. This sort of fighting con
tinued until after 6:30 o'clock last
night when the enemy finally desisted.
Ai'teY having gained a footing in j
bit of forward trench at one time a
body ol Germans pushed through un
til they got to battalion headquarters
and J here the servants, orderlies and
clerks armed themselves and fought
side by side with the infantry until
the eGrmans were beaten back.
One body of Welshmen who were
surrounded in a melee held out and
inflicted heavy casualties on the en
emy until assistance arrived and they
wer able to fight their way out again.

NEAR GIVENCHY
(Contiifuvd from Page One)
the casualties that bad been inflicted
on the Grnians.
Northward of the canal and south
west of Robocq the fighting began
about daylight.
A little after four o'clock large bod
ies of Germans rushed out of the Pa
caut Wood with machine guns and
made for the canal. The British rapid
fire guns were turned on them and
smashed them badly, and they were
forced to retire.
A few minutes later, however, the
enemy again advanced on the run with j
sect.ons of a pontoon bridge, which
were equipped with gas bags to keep 1
them afloat. Notwithstanding the ter
rible, punishment to which they were
subjected, a few Germans succeeded
in getting the sections of the bridge
into the water, but it was found that
the bridge reached only three quarters
of the way across the canal. Virtual
ly every eGrman engaged in this ven
ture mas shot down, and, as already
Hated, a little further northward many
of i lie enemy swam the canal and
surrendered.
Losses Severe
Thr eGrman attack against Kemmel
yesterday, was a complete failure and
their louses here also were very
heavy. The enemy still is having
trouble with his transports. Prison
ers ray tbat as fast as the eGrmansj
have been ame to construct new roans
tiver the wet lowlands of this repion
the Uriiish artillery and bombing
squads have blown them to pieces.
All the prisoners speak of the heavy
losses sustained by the eGrmans. They
declare that they had had only two
day ir.tons in six days of fighting.
It is interesting to note that many
t roc us employed by the Germans in
the ridge section of the north are
picked hill .troops, such as Alpini and
Bavatmns.

Until April 25 Only
This payday is positively your last chance to get in
on this clean cut .speculation at the present low price
of 3 cents per share and 2 cents more when oil is being
produced in corrunercial quantities.
Although we have been drilling only one month, and
have been using a 16 inch bit through 245 feet of blue
limestone that was like flint, we are now down more
than 340 feet and today are in a sandy oil bearing shale
carrying moisture that promises water almost any mo
ment. "
The phenomenal record made by this company and
the efficient rrtanner in whjch its affairs are being han
dled, have made it a ruling favorite throughout the
state, and the stock is being negotiated for now in hun
dred thousand share lots by large interests.
If you ever in your life invested in a proposition
better than this prorrmes to be, you have been very for
tunate. There is certainly nothing more promising in
the state now, and we believe that every man who comes
into the company that is really doing things in the Chino
Valley the United Chirc will make large profits.
See our agents today and let the latest bulletin from
the field you will find it decidedly interesting. Re
member, this is your final chance at the present price.
The stock is worth more money, and it is due for some
sharp raises within the next 30 days. You have a few
days more at the present price get busy and act before
it is too late.

ARREST DOUGLAS MAN
LOUGLAS, Ariz., April 19. William
E. Schwa mm, aged 46, a naturalized
American native of Germany, this af
ternoon was arrested by local agents
or the department of Justice and held
in $10.0000 bail for preliminary hear
ing next Thursday on a charge of
violating the espionage act by mak
ing seditious utterances. Yesterday
morning Scliwamm was released from
jury duty at Tombstone because Doug
las members of the jury refused to
serve with him, alleging tbat be had
refused ' to purchase Liberty bonds.
Sehwamm is reputed to . be worth
flOO.OiiO, most of his property being
realty holdings. He has been a res
ident of Douglas for 17 years.
Details Reach Bisbee
Liberty Loan committees began an
investigation of Schwamm's case early
yesterday morning, following a meet
ing the night before when it was de
cided the committee should act. In
the meantime reports of unpatriotic
utterances by Sch warn m had come to
the: ears of the committee, and they
sent out members to seek verification
of these reports.
Before the morning was over yes
terday witnesses had been found who
made affidavit that on the occasion
of the first Liberty Loan drive,
Sqhwamm declared that he would nev
er purchase bonds because they were
used to buy bullets with which to
shoot his countrymen. Others had
heard him make similar or more scath
ing remarks.
. The committee reassembled- before
noon, heard these reports and decided
tbat they did not wish to accept bis
bond purchase. Instead they laid
their evidence before United States
officials, with the request that they
take whatever action necessary. A
few hours later Schwamm was ar
rested and it was announced that he
had been held to the federal court.
ALUMNI DANCE
I About forty-five couples of B. H. S.
Alumni and their friends enjoyed a
.delightful dance at the High School
Auditorium Friday evening. Parish's
four piece orchestra rendered the mu
sic. This will be the last indoor dance
; of the spring season according to
' the present arrangements owing to
I the approach of the summer weather.
: The proceeds from these dances are
devoted to the Alumni Loan Fund and
quite a sum has been raised this year
from that source. The Alumni play
to be given Monday night, April 29th,
will be for the same purpose. Under
the able direction of Professor Snider
"Young Mrs. Winthrop." is making
great headway and promises to be the
premier attraction in the field of local

DR. MORHODGE HAS
VIVID STORY FOR
WARREN DISTRICT
For the man who is not convinced
that the most horrible crimes con
ceivable are committed by the Turks
and Germans against men, women and
children, and especially girls. Dr. Jo
seph Morhodge has a message. He I
will speak at 8 o'clock tonight at the
Bisbee Y. M. C. A., under the aus
pices of the Warren District Red Cross
Society. Reports from Douglaa late
last night, following his appearance
there, declare that the doctor is the;
greatest car ever to come this direc
tion, and that his message is beyond
words.' "
Dr. Morhodge is an American citi
zen, has been for seventeen years.
He was educated at St. Louis College,
has been in Europe twelve years, was
the Persian physician, .who escaped
the Turks, was wounded and spent
twenty months and eight days in the
German army as a surgeon.
Six Year Old Girls Ravished
He says six year old girls ravished
by Cermans and Turks, and knows
the barbary to be sanctioned by the
German and Turkish governments.
He saw 5,700 people kneel and saw
German soldiers run their swords
through them.
- Dr. Morhodge knows it to be a fact
that 1,600,000 women and girls were
taken prisoners for the soldiers to use
for immoral purposes.
Will Expose the Truth
He has seen men skinned alive as
examples . to others.
Out of 3,500,000 Russian prisoners
only 40,000 are alive, according to Dr.
Morhodge. Germany hasn't food t0
.waste on prisoners, he says.
The doctor will tell his bearers to
night some of the many horrors he
has seen. The truth will be told in
a plain straightforward way.
The doctor has more than once been
forced to use strychnine to quiet his
nerves even months after leaving the
horrible shambles of unurder. rapine
and lU3t in the enemy's war rone. .
Mr. Hush With Him
Dr. Morhodge will arrive In Bis-
bee this morning. illiam W. Husn,
field representative of the Red Cross.
Pacific coast division, is acocmpany
ing him.
. "I have beard Red Cross speakers
before and all "kinds of speakers on
the war," said Mr. Hush, "but Dr.
Morhodge has the most interesting,
most vital message of them all. He
knows conditions. He has lived in
the trenches, behind the lines, has
seen with bis own eyes what he tells!
his hearers. I
The only criticism we find with his i
messages are that they are too short.
When he has spoken for two hours he
has not talked long enough. He has a
message persons should especially
hear who are not convinced of Ger
man and Turkish atrocities and
crimes." ' '

MARY'S ANKLE GIVEN
CAREFUL ATTENTION
Diifcrent roles make different de
mand:; upon actors and every new part
is very apt to add not only to their j
worrie? In life, but to their education
as well. For instance, if an actress is
cast lor the character of stenographer
in a play, the conscientious artist will
make, herself proficient as a typist be
fore the dress rehearsal. When Be
lasco produced "The Girl of the Golden
West" some years ago, and cast
Blanche Bates for the barmaid in the
miners' saloon, the distinguished star
immediately began the study of mix
ing drinks, and became an expert at
it during the rehearsals.
Sometimes the demands are unique.
In the case of Miss Amy Leah Dennis,
"Mary's Ankle,'" the clever New York
hit. which A. H. Woods will present
at tfcf Orpheum April 24. considerable
expente has been added to that young
lady's incidental account due to the
"exigencies of the part." One of the
greatest demands made on Miss Den
nis' abilities is the perilous one of
standing on one foot, like a stork tor
a considerable period of timet But
that foot doesn't worry. It is the
other one the one attached to the
sprained ankle. It is necessary for
this foot and ankle to be exposed for
an entire act. and as Miss Dennis is
an artist, not only to her finger tips,
but; ir this play, to her toetips, she
has ai-ded an expert chirapadist to her
retinue of servants whose duty it is
to come to the theater before each
performance and "make up" that foot
as csretiflly as the player does her
pretty facej.

A committee composed of Messrs.
J R. Anderson, Jesse Yoakum, Miles
Merrill and Sam Kyle, and Mesdames
W. A. Bridse. F. A. McKinney, T. U
Houston and C. S. Wilson, was named
to take charpe of the celebration and
to arrange for the program. They
l.fld their first meeting following the
executive meeting of the general com
ii'ittee. but no plans for publication
were plven out.
Details concemfnjr the remainder of
the drive in this district were dis
cussed at the meeting of the general
committee. It developed that all
lanro subscriptions for the district
have been accounted for and that the
remainder of this district's quota wilt
Lave to be raided throuph the indi
vidual subscriber. The committee re
ports show the district approximately
fP.O.ooo short of the total alloted for
this part of the county. It is hoped
that this amount will be raised be
fore April i'6, LiberfV loan day and
that on the occasion of the demonstra
tion this district can ptit itself on
record as having gene well over the
top.
All the matters taken up by the
comniitTee in their meeting last niKht
w-vere not for publication, but it was
declared following the meeting that
slackers in" this district will be dis
covered and that some means will be
discovered for dealing with these In
dividuals. So details of tie plans
were piven out. but enoupt was said
to assure drastic action will b taken.

The coming of Chaplain Pearson to)
Arizona to become a member of "Arl-;
zona's Own," will be interesting to old i
residents of this state owing to the;
fact that he was born In Tombstone,!
Arizona, and it was a happy coinci- j
Ldenca which gave him the privilege;
of becoming the first chaplain ;u the j
first cavalry regiment formed In the i
state. !

young chaplain, came to Tombstone;

parish grew under his direction, and

A NERVOUS WRECK
From Three Years' Suffering. Sayi
Cardui Made Her Well.
Texas City, Tex. In an interesting
statement, Mrs. Q. H. SchiH, of this town,
says: "For three years I suffered untold
agony with my head. I was unable tb
do any of my woilc
1 just wanted to sleep all the time, for
that was the only ease 1 could get, when
I was asleep. I became a nervous wreck
just from the awful suffering with my
head.
1 was so nervous that the least noise
would make me jump out of my bed. 1
had no energy, and was unable to do
anything. My son, a young boy, had to
do all my household duties.
I was not able to do anything until I
took Cardui. I took three bottles in all
and it surely cured me of those awful
headaches. That has been three years
ago, and I know the cure is permanent,
for I have never had any headache since
taking Cardui. . . ' i
Nothing relieved me until I took Cardui.
It did wonders for me." '
Try Cardui for your troubles made
, from medicinal ingredients recommended
i In medical books as being of benefit in
! female troubles, and 40 years of use has
j proven that the books are right Begin
'faking Cardui today. NC-134

"I cannot praise your wonderful

done much for ma during the past
ten years and I keep It in the house
continually. I was In such a condi
tion tliat I could eat nothing but
bread and milk, and even that was too
heavy for me at times. Now, I can
cat anything. I will recommend Pe

Patriotic citizens of Douglas and Judge
A. G Lockwood of the Cochise county su
perior court deserve no little praise from
the public for the manner in" which they
dealt with a Liberty Bond slacker when
he appeared Thursday in Tombstone for
jury duty. The Douglas citizens reported
to the court that they could not sit on the
same jury with their fellow townsman.
They cited his refusal to assist the govern
ment as cause. The court accepted their
evidence, took the offending juror's state
ment, and ordered his name stricken from
the jury list.
In dismissing the offender the court
used language which only a patriotic
American could use, and with which every
patriotic American agreed. The jurors re
maining applauded.
"I do not blame these citizens of Doug
las who say they cannot sit on a jury with
you," said the judge. "The court does not
consider that you are a decent American
citizen, fit to sit on the jury and you are
discharged from service on the jury and
your name will be stricken from the jury
list. You can go home."
The first Liberty Bond slacker of Co
chise county has been publicly denounced,
when the court and Douglas citizens had
concluded with him. He had received the
just punishment due him. Men with whom
he had lived for fifteen years and among
whom he had thrived had declined to be
associated with him. His refusal to aid
the government had been aired in the pub
lic court room. His denunciation was com
plete. The shame which was heaped upon
him had been brought about by himself. It
was the greatest of all shames the brand
of slacker, of un-Americanism.
The incident carries a lesson for every
individual in the county and nation. This
slacker returned to Douglas and in the face
of his ignomy sought to wipe out a past by
the purchase of bonds. His lesson went to
the core. His heart may not have changed
an atom. His mind may not have been
altered- But his conscience had been
seared to self-shame and his soul had been
burned by the stinging rebuke of the court
and the firm denunciation of men with
whom for years he had been a friend. He
had refused to assist the government to his
fullest ability. His refusal had cost him
in personal regard and friendships what it
had taken fifteen years of hard labor to
build up. He had been disowned by a
community which had formerly honored
and loved him.
Every Liberty Bond slacker should take
this lesson to heart. Every individual who
has not lent to the government his full
quota, should consider this slacker's fate.
Money in times of war can purchase the
honor and respect of a community, for
every man who assists the government
wholeheartedly, will receive the blessing of
his fellow citizens. But money withheld
from the vaults of war can cost its owner
what money can never purchase love,
friendship and close personal and business
relations which only time and hard labor
of years can create, build up and cement.
Buy Liberty Bonds now! And buy to
the limit!
HONOR CIVILIZATION
Now that the statue of Frederick the
Great has been removed from its base at
the War College in Washington, the ques
tion arises whose statue will replace it.
Will it be a military genius, a great leader
in the present world conflict, or a scientist,
or a president, or just a citizen whose name
will be engraved on the scroll of fame?
The statue of Frederick was presented
by the kaist.r to this nation in 1904 as a
"lasting pledge for the continuation of the
friendly relations between Germany and
America." It was unveiled while a marine
bvind played first the German national air,
then the American national anthem. No
Lind plajed when hempen ropes about the
bronze neck of the statue took it from its
base. Loyal, patriotic Americans cheered
indeed the passing of what had become a
blur on the landscape at the national capi
tal In choosing a. successor to the statue
a difficult Uv?k will present itself. The
removal was a job well done. If half so
successful work can be performed in fill
ing the vacancy. most of the public will be
satisfied. But why not honor civilization
in filling the nitch? Why not pay tribute
to the men who preserve civilization and
make life worth while? If another statue
is to be erected, instead of a symbol of the
mailed fist of militarism, it would be more
fitting to unveil a statue typifying civiliza
tion's aims.
SPIRIT OF AMERICA
They were not twelve years old. The
freckles on their faces shone1 through
smiles and the day's layer of dirt. Their
mannish over alls and blue shirts bespoke
the thoroughbred boy. They swaggered,
each with an arm over the other's shoulder,
up Main street. They sang at the tops of
their shrill voices.
They carried the tune well. It was a
war song with military swing, warning the
Hun of the coming of the Yankees and
advising him to beware. The boys were
oblivious of the glances cast their way,
of the many who turned to look efter them.
They sang themselves out of sight.
Singing, the Yankee goes into battle.
It is the spirit of America, indomitable,
unconquerable, free.
AIR, THIN AIR
A bubble broken. Briefly, these three
words sum up the meeting of the Arizona
mine managers with the executive commit
tee of the state council of defense in Phoe
nix Wednesday and Thursday. Tersely,
this is what was accomplished. The cause
for calling the meeting was found to be
air, thin air.
But in shattering the bubble which had
been blown up 'and tossed onto the Arizona
air, the source of rumors which have been
assiduously circulated in the state was de
termined; the attitude of the mine man
agers in regard to these rumors and reports
was definitely established, and a decided
step was put to the spreading of further
stories of like evil intent.
A resolution passed by the state coun
cil of defense executive committee was di
rectly the cause of the meeting. This reso
lution declared "reliable infotrna'tion"
from "reputable sources," that the mines
of Arizona were employing I. W. W. for
the purpose of disturbing labor conditions,
had come to the ears of the committee. The
Arizona Chapter American Mining con
gress replied to the resolution. Conse
quently the meeting was arranged.
When the meeting was called by
Dwight B- Heard, chairman of the com
mittee, a spokesman for the mine officials
stated the object of their visit. A labor
organizer and agitator then tec!: the floor
and conducted the remainder of the meet
ing. He offered again his ' rr'.iable in
formation' for the considuiation of those
present.
The "reliable information" proved to
be the wildest sort of rumor, so weak, so
palpably fabricated that it could not be
branded hearsay evidence. Supposition,
perhaps best defines it.
The "reputable sources" proved to be
two labor agitators.
So the meeting ended. Those who had
furnished the informatoin on which it had
been called for were forced to admit there
was no reason for the conference. That was
the first result. The second is greater
through the admission of the labor agita
tors that their information was merely
supposition, rumors of mines knowingly
employing I. W. W. to disturb labor con
ditions have been definitely and forever
branded false and without foundation. It
is true the executive committee should
have investigated further and obtained at
least some supportable facts before call
ing the meeting. But it is fortunate for the
state the meeting was called.
A bubble has been shattered. Air,
thin air, has been released.
With reductions in the per capita al
lowance of flour for Arizona, the state may
face soon a condition similar to that in
Texas, where no new flour is to be sold.
The food administration declares less than
two month's supply is now in sight in this
state.
