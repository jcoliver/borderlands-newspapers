(By Review Leased Wire).
PHOENIX, May 7. That an
effort will be made to prosecute
the fifty or more masked men
who participated yesterday morn
ing in the lynching of Star Daley
for killing James Ray Gibson and
attacking Mrs." Gibson on the
Apache trail Thursday night, was
made apparent today, when Attor
ney General Wiley E. 'Jones di
rected letters to the county attor
neys of Mar'copa and Pinal coun
tigajjrajng an Investigation At-
tcmey Jones calls attention to the
,circumstance that though . the
movement culminating in the
death of Daley, whose real name
is Van Ashmore, had its origin in
Maricopa county, and though most
of the participants were of Mari
copa county, the actual hanging
of Daley took Place in Pinal.
Governor Campbell has so far
issued no statement with respect
to the lynching.
A coroner's Jury in Pinal had
found that "Daley was the victim
of Justifiable homicide committed
by persons unknown to the Jury,"
Also the idenfity of none of the
members of the mob are known
o the officers. The Pinal au
thorities expressed doubt that a
conviction could be secured even
if any of the members of the
mob were brought to trial.
Taken Prom Sheriff
Daley, whose 'right name was Van
Ashemore, was taken from deputy
sheriffs early Sunday morning, as he
was being transferred from the Jail
In Phoenix to the penitentiary at
Florence, taken to the scene of his
crime and there executed after the
vigilantes, fifty in numbr, had recited
the Lord's prayer.'
On Thursday night, Daley had come
upon James Gibson and his wife In
camp on the desert, had murdered
Gibson and forced the woman to sub
mit to his whims throughout the night
He was captured Friday when he left
the Gibson automobile, in which be
had forced Mrs. Gibson to accompany
him, to get some gasoline.
A coroner's jury yesterday returned
a verdict of "justifiable homicide at
the hands of parties unknown." at the
Inquest on the body of Daley, which
was buried In the sands of the des
ert at the place fit the execution.
Deputy Sheriffs Sam Barrett and
Ben Muagrave, from whom Daley was
taken by the mob. would not make a
statement for publication, but they re
ported to the sheriff that all of the
men In the mob wore whie handker
chiefs over thei rface sand that it
was Impossible to Identify anyone.
They were fully armed and that It
was useless to offed resistance, al
though the officers endeavored to
persuade them to let the law take Its
course. Although the deputies took
a roundabout road in attempting to
remove Daley from Phoenix to the
state prison for safe keeping, they
found their way blocked by the mob,
which had hurried out after midnight
In automobiles.
It became known today that cltl
iens of both Maricopa and Pinal coun
ties had covered all the roads between
Phoenix and Florence, the deputies'
goal, and that no matter which road
they had taken, Daley would have
been captured.
The prisoner was removed from the
Jail here at midnight. when the of-

WASHINGTON, May 7. The usual
channels of information through
which news of America's relationship
to foreign powers are now to reach
the public were disclosed by Secretary
Lansing today.
An order bearing his name was dis
tributed broadcast instructing state
department officials not to talk with
newspaper men "even on Insignificant
matters of fact or detail." Hence
forth, under the order, the press will
not be able to discuss the background
of complicated international questions
with the experts at the head of each
bureau.
The order says that hereafter all
news must be given out either by the
secretary himself or by the newly cre
ated so-called bureau of foreign in
telligence. Secretary Lansing sees
the newspaper men twice daily, but
does not pretend to be able to answer
the questions asked by the newspaper
men. The meetings are becoming
more and more perfunctory.
The bureau of foreign intelligence
is about a month old and is charged
not only with the press work, but with
supplying news to all American mis
sions abroad. Usually very much be
hind the press cables because of the
need of coding and decoding, the bu
reau at the same time, because of its
relative lack of authority, confines
itself mostly to formal statements on
news facts and does not attempt to
provide the background or explana
tion which gives international news
its real value.
Consequently, from now on. if to
day's order remains In effect the pub
lic will receive from the state depart
ment only such perfunctory news as
the bureau gives out and such frag
mentary explanations as Secretary
Lansing himself finds time for in the
crush of other work. The bureau
chiefs, handling questions of the Far
East or Western Europe will not be
able to give to the public the benefit
of their expert knowledge and Inti
mate familiarity of their specialized
situations.
BILL WILL STOP

WASHINGTON, May 7. Unquali

port embargoes by the President was
restored to the administration espion
age bill by the senate today after
Democratic Leader Martin had ex
plained behind closed doors that Pres
ident Wilson feared he would be un
able to accomplish the ends desired
under the section as it bad been made.
The provision as it now stands
would empower the President during
the war "when the public safety shall
so require" to proclaim it, unlawful to
export articles to "any country
named." Last week the senate voted
to authorize embargoes only against
countries through which goods were
found to be reaching the enemy. To
day's action was proceeded by a five
hour debate in executive session dur
ing which for the first time slnce the
United States went to war with Ger

The expedition will have a total
strength of between 11.000 and 12,000
men, each regiment being composed
of two batallions of three companies
each. Every branch of railway work- i

a force already trained to the minute,

which were not directed at the Presi

Senator Martin stated when the

senate should reverse itself. He said
the government has reason to believe
that American exports were getting

POSTAL SERVICE
(By Review Leased Wire)
WASHINGTON, May 7. The un
fatheomed possibilities of the United
States mails as a medium of govern
mental publicity are to be developed at
once to bring home to every person
in the country the need of subscribing
to the liberty loan. Every letter oi
the millions that pass through the
mails soon is to bear a special can
cellation stamp of striking design to
notify all persons receiving mail that
the action is calling for contributions
to the big bond issue. Every letter
box of the hundreds of thousands In
the country is to be placarded with
posters announcing the loan and the
need for contributions. Every post-
office is to display posters prominent
ly giving full information.
Every one of the 60,000 vehicles
operated by the pestoffice department
is to proclaim in large type from pos
ters cn its sides that the liberty loan is
open to subscriptions and this is the
duty of every citizen who can to sub
scribe. Every letter carrier in every
city is to have a card to pul In his
cap so that wherever his whistle is
heard the call to subscribe will be
carried.
More than that, every carrier is to
he an active bureau of information as
to the terms and details of the issue.
Responses to the offer of the big is
sue have been extremely gratifying
thus far, Mr. McAdoo said tonight
Today's partial tabulation of replies
received from banks and banke
showed no dimination in the rate at
which subscriptions are pouring in
Thirty five of the chief cities of the
country offered to take $104,846,000
worth f the bonds today in addition
to previous offers bringing the total
up to $236,976,000 for the three days
during which subscriptions have been
received.
In many instances, however, the
offers were in the nature of estimates
as to what could be taken rather than
outright offerings to subscribe. In
making the totals of the subscriptions
received thus far include:
Boston $13,290,000; Chicago $25,000.

LEMONS BRING OUT
THE HIDDEN BEAUTY
Make this lotion for very little
cost and just see
for yourself.
vt uai fciri or woman hasnt' heard
of lemon juice to remove complexion
blemishes; to bleach the skin and to
bring out the roses, the freshness and
the hidden beauty? But lemon juice
alone is acid, therefore Irritating, and
should be mixed with Orchard white
this way: Strain through a fine cloth
the juice of two fresh lemons Into a
bottle containing about three ounces
of orchard white, then shake well and
you have a whole quarter pint of skin
and complexion lotion at ab'out the
cost one usually pays for a small Jar
of ordinary cold cream. Be sure to
strain the lemon juice so no pulp gets
into the bottle, then this lotion will
remain pure and fresh for months.
When applied daily tt th face, neck,
arms and hands it should help to
bleach, clear, smoothen and beautify
the skin.
Any druggist will supply three
ounces of orchard white at very lit
tle cost and the grocer has the lemons.
11,000 ENGINEERS
WILL GOTO FRANCE
(Continued From Page One)
Boston, Pittsburg, Detroit, Atlanta,
San Francisco and Philadelphia.
Brotherhoods o Held
Officials believe the great railroad
trotherhoods will co-operate throwing
the strpnrth cf the unions behind the
recruiting efforts. The railway com-T-.an'es
already are so organied under
the Council of National Defense that
'heir co-operation is assured. The en
gineers and officials of the lines who
effer themselves will be selected in
nuch manner as not to cipple the op
erating forces of any company.
The decision to send the engineers
is understood to have grown out of
conferences here between government
officials and members of the French
and British war missions. One of the
Teat problems of the war has been
that of maintaining adequate supply
lines and the railroads are the vital
-lenient of the system that feeds men
shells and food toward the fighting
'ine.
U. S. to Do R. R. Feats
Engineering feats of spectacular
nature have been accomplished in
perfecting these communication lines.
A whole British railroad was picked
up bodily, rolling stock, rails, road
bed. and all. and taken to France.
American engineers had much to do
with that, they have, under direction
of the British arid French goTern
ipnts drivn tunnels, built spurs and
bridges and mapped out schemes of
rnsrortation that are in operation
today.
America is nre-eminent in the field
of railway engineeing and the best
talent and experience the nation can
provide in that line will go into the
new regiments, each of which would
- able to undertake all or any part
of the work of building or operating
i whole railway system. The admin-
j 'station's action means the American
troops earning the American nag
nd i nthe uniform of the American
rmy are soon to be on French soil.
If there is psychological value, in
euch action, as the French and Brit
ish commission have urged, it will

The Coming Baby
Every help that will tend to aid
the expectant mother and foster the
well-being of the tiny infant should
be promptly rendered.
The time before childbirth is one
of much discomfort. This is caused
in a large measure by the tightening
and straining of the abdominal tis
sues, as well as the network of cords,
ligaments and muscles in that part
of the body.
For many years thousands of
women have successfully used the
preparation known as "Mother's
Friend." It is safe and dependable
to be used by every prospective
mother. A famous physician formu
lated the preparation. "Mother's
Friend" is for external use, and is
composed of special oils and other in
gredients which have a penetrating
and softening effect Relief from
much of the pain at the crisis is
found. .
Any woman awaiting childbirth
should secure a bottle of "Mother's
Friend" from her druggist, when the
abdomen first begins to expand. No
time should be lost in beginning its
use. Apply it night and morning
vithout fail. Adriress Bradfield Regu

occurred four hours later at the scene
of the attack cn the Gibsons, near
Mesa. Daley, who had retained his 1
composure during the preliminaries to j
the lynching and who showed a mem
ber of the party how to make a noose.
collapsed at the last minute, when he
was asked if he wished to pray and
the mob recited the Lord's prayer in
uniscn for him. Before he was
hanged,' Daley "confessed to the kill

Kansas, Missouri and California in
which he said he had taken part and
in which he believed he had killed

yesterday morning at 4 o'clock to say

few feet of where he had murdered
James Gibson and within eyesight

criminally assaulted the man's wife.
"Oh, God," said Daley, and then his
voice broke, and head sunk to his
breast. His manacled hands came up

fused to form another word.
"Gentlemen," someone remarked,
"we will all bare our heads and say

"Our Father which art in Heaven,"
was started, and with bared and
bowed heads, fifty men stood in a cir
cle around Daley, and repeated the
grayer through o the finish. At the
conclusion, Daley jumped to his feet,
md with a glance around said:
"Well, gentlemen, let's do it up

ct it be pulled out from under me."
A long white rope, brought all the
vay from Phoenix, was thrown over
the cross arm of a telephone pole, a
' ansrman's knot was quickly tied, a
machine was backed up, and every
hing was in readiness.
"Have you anything to say?".some--sno

He was aided to mount the back
of the rear seat of the machine. The

ruite tree. Daley's hat was placed
on his head at his request, and some
shouted: "Go ahead, and Deley swung
out into space, making a drop of about
three feet. His feet were nearly

Advice to Socialists
"Let the German socialists attend
to this and cease their false pretenses

tive peace in the interests of kaiser-
ism. Let them cease calling pre
tended "international conferences at

"!erman military caste.
"Now the Russian autocracy is ov
erthrown, neither the American gov
Tnment, nor the American people ap
prehend that the wisdom and experi
nee of Russia in the coming years
vill adopt any form of government
'han the one best, suited to your
needs. We feel confident that no mes-

ice whatever to Russia as to the con
Mict of t.er internal affairs. Any com-
mission that may be sent will help
lussia in any way that she desires

"Word has reached us that false re
ports of an American purpose and

some circulation in Russia. We de
nounce the reports as th criminal

circulated with the intent to
eceive 'tnd to arounf hostile feelings
etween the two great democracies of

"The American government, the
American people, the American labor
movement are whole-heartedly with
he Russian workers, the Russian
nasses, in the great effort to main
ain the freedom you have already
chieved. and to solve the grave prob
?ms yet before you. We earnestly
ppeal to you to make common cause

WAR BRIDES COMES '
TO ORPHEUM THEATRE
Madame Nazimova Featured
In War Play. Plays InBis-
bee Three Days.
"War Brides", the first production
by the Herbert Brenon Film Corpora
tion for Selznick-Pictures, will be seen
at the Orpheum theatre on Wednes
day. This photodrama will introduce to
moving picture patrons a new star,
Nazimova. Well known on the stage,
she is now making her debut on the
screen In a film version of the play
by Marion Craig Wentworth. in which
she made a sensational success in
vaudeville. She had refused all others
until she saw "A Daughter of the
Cods," which Brenon wrote and di
rected, and was so charmed by the
work that she signed a contract to
appear under his direction.
"War Brides" is an intensely drama
tic story, but while it has to do with
conditions brought about by way,
there are no battle scenes. A trench
is shown, and the effect of the fight
ing upon the troops, but no battle
scene is enacted. The main st'ory has
to do with the sufferings of the women
at home. Joan, the young widow, de
fies the military authorities, and
urges the young women of the village
to refuse to become brides of the
departing soldiers. She is imprisoned
but escapes, and leads a band of
m'ourning women to meet the King
and protest against war. Her own in
dividual message she delivers in a
most dramatic manner.
Herbert Brenon has excelled him
self in this production. His previous
successes, "Neptune's Daughter," "The
Soul of Broadway," "The Clemenceaa
Case," "The Kreutzer Sonata," and
others, have won for his a reputation
second to that of tto other director in
the world and he stakes his reputation
upon "War Brides" as his greatest
work down to the present.

What is the big distinction between
members tf the royal families and

them to hold their own with their so

Frank Bennett made his first ' ap
pearance on the Triangle program as
leading man for Lillian Gish in "Sold
for Marriage" and created a decided
ly favorable impression by his re
pressed but extremely forceful s-creen
work. Since then he has been seen in
the Douglas Fairbanks play, "Reggie
Mixes In," as leading man for Dorothy
Gish in "Gretchen the Greenhorn," and
with Bessie Love in her first starring
vehicle, "A Sister of Six."
In "The Heiress at Coffee Dan's,"
which appears tonight at the Orpheum,
which marks Miss Love's second star
ring performance, Bennett is again
seen opposite her in a quaint charac
ter role which he is said to interpret
most interestingly. It is that of a
simple hearted but extremely eccen- j
trie composer, who finds himself con
fronted with the task of rescuing his
beloved from a band of crooks. Dis
playing unexpected energy and valor,
he succeeds and reaps a monetary re
ward for the capture of the criminals,
which enables him to get a start on
a musical as well as a matrimonial
career.

"JUSTIFIABLE HOMOCIDE."
Though there s hrdly a man or woman in the entire
state of Arizona who approves of lynch law and its at
tendant evils, the proportion of people who disapproves of
the fate meted out to Vane Ashmore, alias Starr Daley,
Bear Phoenix early Sunday morniny, is smaller stilL A
murderer and debaucher, of the worst type, paid a pen
alty, deserved in toto. His end was, undoubtedly, "justi
fiable homocide."
There are many people in the state who are, conscient
iously, against the infliction of the death penalty. There
is much argument on both sides of the question and in
the last election those who opposed the old Arizona
statute had their will approved. Hanging waa abolished
in Arizona.
We have seen one of the first results.
Vane Ashmore, alias Starr Daley, entered the camp
of a tourist on the Phoenix.Roosevelt Road and foully
murdered the man. He then debauched the wife of
the dead. Upon being arrested he made the assertion
that he would not hang in Arizona. Unfortunately, for
the sake of the law and its right that it should be upheld,
and fortunately for the sake of humanity and law-abiding
people, the state was purged of an ulcer. And few are
sorry.
Sunday's lynching was the first in thirty years in Ari
tona. During that thirty years capital punishment waa
upon the statute books or the territory and state. Men
who murdered without cause of reason, always saw. In
the distance, the vague shadow of the scaffold. As a
deterant for capital offenses its effect was wonderful.
That deterant Ws removed and the trial and execution
of sentence of the first atrocious crime was taken from
its proper channel, the court, and put into the hands of
a mob.
It is extremely regrettable that murdef should be com
mitted. It is more regrettable that Arizona should be
the scene of a crime as revolting as the one perpetrated
near Phoenix. Murder, like other crime, is impossible of
complete eradication. In view of these things it would
seem wise to use the hand of the law in its prevention.
It may be unseemly to forcast further blots upon the
fair name of the state of Arizona but it is safe to con
jecture that when the proper and merited punishment is
not meted out by society's chief guardian the law
then the law will be taken into the hands of men. It is
an unfortunate commentary on the make-up of human
nature.
In this particular instance, the verdict of most people
appears to be that the coroner's jury was " right and
proper; that it was a case of "justifiable homocide."
WORTHY OF ATTENTION.
Men from every part of the state are enlisting for ser
vice in the First Arizona Infantry. Whatever may be
held against some of the political operations of the guard,
in the past, and its influence, therein, at the present time,
the commonwealth must recognize in the unit its big con
tribution to the nation at the present time. Aid must
be given it in every wa and one of the present requests
that should be made to the people is help for the enlisted
men in the matter of providing recreation for the en
listed men.
It is rather hard for the average man or woman to
"jar" himself or herself out of a rut and conceive of the
work which is being done by the enlisted men and officers
of the regiment. Encouragement should be the portion
meted out for all of them.
Chaplain G. L. Horene. of the regiment, is sending out
an appeal for funds wift which to aid the enlisted men
of the First Arizona. Bisbee's quoto to the regiment has
not been overly large but the people, locally, have easy
access to actual conditions at Naco and should appreciate
the need as set out by the Chaplain in this morning's
Review.
It will be an eay matter for the Warren District to
start the "ball rolling" towards helping the First Arl
sona. Let Bisbee be first in this matter. It will be re
turned In a thousand ways from the many men who are
serving their country at Naco.

engaged in this engrossing pasttime, it might be doubted
whether the fight had ever been called in question. As
a matter of fact, congress has always imagined that it
had the power to punish for "contempt" any person whose
criticism got under its legislative hide. The house cf
representatives undertook last year to apply the sur
posed right in the case of United States District Attorney
Marshall of New York City, because of truculent remark-,
he had made before a house committee in criticism of the
pro-German activities of certain congressmen.
The supreme court has now happily decided that there
is no such crime In the American category as congress
ional lese-majestic: Congress has no power, express or
implied, to punish any critical comment tjiat falls short
of "physical destruction of the right of the house to carry
on its proceedings." That is to say, we may jump onto
congress as vigorously as we like, bo long as we stop
short of leading a delegation of irate citizens into the
legislative chamber, throwing out the congressmen and
smashing the furniture.
To permit congress or any other governmental body
to punlBh for contempt' persons merely guilty of verbal
criticism would. Chief Justice White says, "strike a knife
at the very roots of the wJiole system of representative
government."
Representative government lives by criticism of its
servants, and thrives on it. So whenever any congress

Cordero started to denounce the Am

Womqn Slaps Man as Climax
To Battle of Rocks and Bullets
Not satisfied with having had him
arrested and tried on a charge of as
sault with attempt to kill. Mrs. Grace
Finnerty took matters into her own
hands yesterday afternoon and slapped
George Rupert a stinging blow in the
face at the conclusion of Rupert's
hearing in Lowell justice court The
case had been taken under advise
ment by Judge Winters and the slap
ping occurred as Rupert and Mrs.
Finnerty loft the court room and be
came involved in an argument in the
fill.
Testimony at Rupert's hearing yes
terday showed that there had been
til feeling between th two families
for some time regarding land and
v ptr rights on their ranches near Don
Luis. On the morning of May 3, it
was claimed. Mrs. Finnerty and her
sun. Tom. saw a bull dog chasing
their cows, which were feeding in Ru
rert's pasture. Rupert, who was Just
leaving Ms home in a buggy, told the
Finnertys to stop as they ran toward
the cows, it was testified. When they
did not heed his command, they said,
Rupert fired a shot over their heads.
M's. Finnerty then picked up sev
erral rocks and hurled hem at Ru
pert's buggy. The horse became
frightened and started away at a fast
pace, it is claimed, while Rupert
dodged the rocks tired by his neigh
bors and fired two more shots in their
direction. The Finnertys claim that
Rupert allows theijj tows to graze in
his pasture, in order that he can
"sit k" the bulldog on them. Rupert
denies this. He told the court that
he only tired to keep Mrs. Finnerty
and her son off his property, and
with no Intention of hurting them.

then raised the knife to strike the
young Mexican again, it is said, but
was overpowered by Francisco Mar
tinez, who took the knife away frcn
him. Cordero was placed under arrest
a few minutes later by Officer Hill
Ruff and placed ln the city jaiL
When the news of the stabbing
spread around town, a score of pat
riotic Mexican-Americans gathered at
uie jail and pleaded with the officers
to allow them to deal with Cordero.
They finally dispersed after promising
to deal out punishment to Cordero
themselves if Gallego died from tha
effects of the knife wound.
Gallego holds a honorary discharge
from the First Arizona, iiaring served
with the Tucson company, and Is one
of the most popular young Mexicans ia
the city. Cordero has been here for
several months, conducting a Spanish
and English school on Brewery Gulch.
He was taken before Judge High about
two weeks ago for refusing to answer
questions put to him by Jack O'Lough
liu, military census taker in the dis
trict, but willingly answered the ques
tions after having been landed in the
court room. Cordero is ot very
highly respected by the local Mexican
population, especially since stabbing
the young ex-soldier. Considerable
anarchistic literature was found in
his rooms Sunday and yesterday by
officers, and government agents in
this part cf the state are investigating
his activities here since his arrival
and also his past history, which is said
to include a penitentiary record in
Lower California.
Ccrdero will be given a preliminary
hearing before Judge M. C. High at
2:30 o'clock tomorrow afternoon.

CHICAGO, May 7. Expectation of
a bullish government crop report had
a deal to do with the sharp advance
which took place in wheat values to
day. The market after touching new
hieh record prices closed nervous at
net gains of one-half to 4V with May
at 2.S3 to 2.S3"i and July at 2.25 to
2.26U. Corn finished five-eighths off

varying from 25 cents decline to a
rise of 2'4-
In the upward flight of wheat prices
the May option soared to 2.85 where
as the previous topmost level was
2.80. Favorable weather for seeding
In the northwest tended to increase
selling in the last half of the day
however, and caused something of a
bearish reaction. Trade at no time
had much volume and there was an
effort on all sides to discourage spec

Course grain at first followed wheat
but sagged later on account of fine
weather.
Lower quotations on hogs weakened
provisions.
