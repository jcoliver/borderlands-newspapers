OF ORLANDO
Says Wilson's Action Came
. as He Was About. to Make
Supreme Attempt at Unity
Impossible to Continue at the
Peace Conference in Face
of Statement by President
PARIS, April 23. (By the Asso
ciated Press) The council of three
this afternoon held the longest ses
sion on . record during the peace
conference, the question of repara
tions from 3 o'clock until 7 o'clock.
Financial experts were called in to
explain some details, but some
questions remain to be considered
tomorrow. -
PARIS, April 23. (Havas.) Pre
mier Orlando of Italy expressed pro
found surprise today at the declara
tion of President Wilson, which he
said came at a time when he was
"about to make a supreme attempt at
conciliation."
"The Italian delegates, hoping to
see the Italian problem adjusted amic
ably," he continued, "might have tak
en some other decision, than ceasing
to collaborate in the lators of the con
ference had- this statement not been
issued."
The premier added that he would
address a message to "the Italian peo
ple, who, he said, "will express them
selves." Following the publication of Mr.
Wilson's note on the Adriatic ques
tion, newspaper men flocked to the
Italian delegation's headquarters. Pre
m'er Orlando received them. He re
called to them the fact that Italy had
consented to possible concessions re
garding the Dalmatian hinterland and
added that he had received this morn
ing, from England, France and the
United States a reply recognizing the
rights of Italy over the Italian cities
of Dalmatia but refusing to give recog
nition to Italian claims on Fiume
which w-ould become a free city with
out mandatory administration by any
power. , ;
"The delegation having learned that
this was the opinion of President
Wilson," he said, "declined in . the
course o fa meeting to acknowledge
the declaration of Mr. Wilson, which
was published this evening and de
cided to address to France and Great
Britain, signatory nations to the treaty
of London, a letter setting forth the
impossibility of continuing participa
tion In the labors of the peace con
ference and expressing regret that the
declaration of Mr. Wilson had render
ed impossible the last supreme effort
toward conciliation on the part of
Italy. The message paid homage to
the loyalty and fidelity of France and
England."
Organized Plot to Destroy

(By Review Leased Wire)
WASHINGTON, April 23. Post
master General Burleson in a state

thereby to aid in bringing about re

second class rates.

of a committee seeking .repeal of the
law, urged him to acquiesce and blunt
ly Informed him, "we ruined Postmas
ter General Hitchock and destroyed
Mr. Taft." Later1, it said, a well
known publisher, also unnamed, prom
ised that Mr. Burleson would be made
the most popular man in the cabinet
if he would aid or acquiesce in the
repeal, and said "but If you do not, I
fear they will ruin you."

Explain Treaty
PARIS, April 23. In connection
with the question, of permitting
the German delegates to the peace
congress to discuss the treaty it
has been figured out that if the
treaty were red to the Germans
it would require at (east one min
ute for each of the 1000 articles
the document conta'ns,, taking up
two days of eight hours each. It
is computed also that if each
article were discussed and an hour
allowed for every one the .discus
sion would occupy four months of
continued sessions of eight hours
per day.
These calculations are advanced
as a conclusive argument against
permitting the German delegates
to discuss the document.
he was confronted by a systematic
propaganda of selfish interests who.)
through repeal of the law would be
able to "resume enjoyment of a pos
tal subsidy of over 170,000,000 per an
num." Even under the zone low, he
added, there still would be an annual
loss of more than $50,000,000 to be
made out of the general public.
This statement followed one given
out at the postoffice department dur

Half Billion Already Sold
For these reasons officials were in

Full Text of Wilson's
Refusal to Grant War
Claims Made by Italy
PARIS. April 23. The full text of
President Wilson's statement on the
Italian situation follows:
"In view of the capital importance
of the questions affected, and in order
to throw all possible light upon what
is involved in their settlement, I hope
that the following statement will con
tribute to the final formation of opin
ion and to a satisfactory solution: "
"When Italy entered the war she
entered upon the basis of a definite
private understanding ' with Great
Britain and France, now known as the
pact of London. Since that time the
whole face of circumstances has been
altered. Many other powers, great and
small, have entered the struggle, wltn
no knowledge of that private under
standing. "The Austro-Hungarian empire,
then the enemy of Europe, and at
whose expense the pact of London was
to be kept in the event of victory,
has gone to pieces and no longer ex
ists. Not only that, but the several
parts of that empire, it is felt now
by Italy and all her associates, are
to be erected into independent states
and associated in a league of nations,
not with those who were recently our
enemies, but with Italy herself and
the powers that stood with Italy in
the great war for liberty.
Peace Meet to Protect Small States
"We are to establish their liberty
as well as" our own". They are to be
among the smaller states whose inter
ests are henceforth to be safeguardeq
as scrupulously as the interests of the
most powerful states.
"The war was ended, moreover, by
proposing to Germany an armistice
and peace which should be founded on
certain clearly defined principles
which set up a new order of right and
jutsice. Upon those principles the
peace with Germany has been con
ceived, not only, but formulated. Upon
those principles it will be concluded.
We cannot ask the great body of pow
ers to propose and effect peace with
Austria and establish a new basis of
independence and right in Jthe states
which originally constituted the Au
stro-Hungarian empire and in the
states of the Balkan group on prin
ciples of another kind. We must ap
ply the same principles to the settle
ment of Europe in those quarters that
we have applied in the peace with
Germany.
"It was upon the explicit avowa-of
those principles that the initiative for
peace was taken. It is upon them
that the.whole structure of peace must
rest. .
Why Ifaly Can't Have Fiume
. '"If those principles are to be ad
hered to, Fiume must serve as the
outlet of the commerce, not of Italy,
but of the land to the north and north
east of that port; Hungary, Bohemia,
Rumania and the states of the new
Jugo-Slav group. To assign Flume to
Italy would be to create the feeling
that we have deliberately put the port
upon which all those countries chief
ly depend for their access to the Medi
terranean in the hands of a power of
which it did not form an integral part
and whose sovereignty if set up there,
must inevitably . seem .foreign, not do
mestic ; not identified with the com
mercial and industrial life of the re
gions which the port must serve. It
is for that reason, no doubt, that
Fiume was not included in the pact of
London, but there definitely assigned
to the Croatians.
"And the reason why the line of the
pact of London swept about many of
the Islands of the eastern coast of the
Adriatic and around the portion of the
Dalmatian coast which liea most open
to that sea was not only that here
and there on those islands, and here
and there on that coast, there are bod
ies of people of Italian blood and con
nection, but also, and no doubt chiefly,
because it was felt that it was neces
sary for Italy to have a foothold
amidst the channels of the eastern
Adriatic in order that she might make
her own coasts safe against the naval
aggressions of Austria-Hungary.
Austrian Menace Gone.
"But Austria-Hungary no longer ex
ists. It is proposed that the fortifica
tions which the Austrian government
constructed there shall be razed and
: permanently destroyed.
"It is part also of the new plan of
European order which, centers in the
league of nations that the new states
erected there shall accept a limitation
ofifc armament, which puts aggression
GTOAY
out of the question. There can be no
fear of the unfair treatment of groups
oi Italian people there, because ade
quate guarantees will be gievn, under
international sanction, of the equal
and equitable treatment of all racial
or national minorities.
"In brief, every question associated
with this settlement) wears a new as
pect a new aspect given it by the
very victory for right for which Italy
has made the supreme sacrifice of
blood and treasure. Italy, along with
the four other great powers, has be
come one of the chief trustees of the
new order which she has played so
honorable a part in establishing. .
"And on the north . and northeast
her national frontiers are completely
restored, along with the whole sweep
of the Alps from northwest to south
east to the ery end of the Istrian pen
insula, including all the great water
shed within which Triest and Pola lie
and all the fair regions whose lace
nature has turned towards the great
peninsula upon which the historic life
of the Latin people was worked out
through centuries of famous story ever
since Rome was first set upon her
seven hills.
Ancient Unity Restored
"Her ancient unity is restored. Her
lines are extended to the great .walls
which are her natural defence. It is
within her choice to be surrounded by
friends ; to exhibit to the- newly liber
ated peoples across the Adriatic tnat
noblest quality of of greatness, that

ITALIANS QUIT WHEN
WILSON DENIES CLAIMS
ContInued from Page One)
ated Press.) President Wilson's em
phatic declaration that he will not
yield on the Adriatic question has
created the most proround sensation
in the peace conference. He has
thrown down the gauntlet to the sup
porters of secret treaties in a man
ner which almost took away the
breath of the delegates who have been
urging compromises on points, already
covered by many secret documents
and at variance with the president's
14 points.
President Wilson's sweeping decla
ration, while aimed directly at the
Adriatic problems, also reaches the
Kiau-Chau controversy, in which
made with Great Britain, France and
Japan relies on secret agreements,
Italy in 1917, to support her in her
claim to the concessions held by Ger
many in Shantung. .
Challenge to Secret Treaties
The peace delegates generally, re
gard President Wilson's statement as
a challenge which once for all will dis
pose of the question whether secret
documents, of. which many nations
participating in the war were ignor
ant, are to figure in the peace follow
ing an armistice in which all the al
lies pledged gave no regard to secret
treaties.
The Italian situation overshadowed
all other questions throughout the
day in Paris and was the sole subject
of conversation in official and unof
ficial circles. .
When it became known this morn
ing that the Italian premier, Vittorio
Orlando, was again, absent from the
session of the council of four, various
rumors became current. Proposals
and counter-proposals were made be
tween the members of the British,
French and Italian delegations, and
numerous stories of compromises were
circulated. These were suddenly dis
credited by the issuance of President
Wilson's statement, showing that the
president was not a party , to the pro
posed concessions, which was chiefly
based on the supposition that Fiume
could be given to Italy.
. The idea which had been prevalent
In Paris that the Adriatic situation,
was a game of chess, in which the
most skillful diplomats would win re-
gardless of the armistice conditions,
was suddenly banished by President
Wilson's action. '
Since Monday it had been generally
known that he had prepared a state
ment which was presented on that
a-,v tn the entire American delegation,
and that the delegation had approved
it. But there was no suspicion rnai
his position was so ; unalterably
against secret diplomacy. -t
Declarations by the members of the
American delegation that the presi
dent would not yield on the matter oi
lTiiimp.. were regarded my most Euro
pean diplomatists, and especially by j
the Italians, as pari .or a Fai
game, until today, and even now many
old-school diplomatists seem unable t?
comprehend what has happened.
A member of the Italian delegation
said- that , the delegates' would not
leave Paris tonight. . He did not know
what action might be taken tomor
row. Premier Orlando, Foreign Minister

WHERE YOU CAN DO BETTER
Fhone29
Raggi, the other Italian delegates,
have been in conference at their head
quarters since this morning discuss
ing the situation created by the presi
dent's statement. -
PEACE SITUATION SUMMARY
(By the Associated Press.)
Italy has the verdict of the United
States government as regards her
claims in the Adriatic. She may not
have her aspirations for Fiume. grati
fied for that would block in from the
sea behind the coast of Dalmatia the
new small independent nations which
are to become members of the league
of nations.
President Wilson in a long state
ment dealing with the controversy
over Fiume, has clearly defined to
Italy the -stand of the United States
in the premises and thus has brought
to a climax the crisis that has exist
ed for many days.
- Danger of Aggression Past.
With regard to the islands in the
eastern Adriatic and that portion of
the Dalmatian coast, Which lies most
open to t&e sea which Italy also is demanding,-
President Wilson broadly
states that these are not now neces
sary to Italy to make her safe against
naval aggression by Austria-Hungary,
because Austria-Hungary no longer ex
ists, and the fortifications along the
coast are to be permanently destroyed.
Also, -the president says, the new
states are to accept limitation of arm
aments, which will further put aggres
sion out of the question, and that
equal and equitable treatment of all
racial or national minorities through
out this region are to be guaranteed
until international sanction.

DIFFER
1
COURTS
NAM
WASHINGTON. April 23. The rad
ical difference of opinion, that exists
not only in military circles but among
lawyers as to the present system ol
military Justice, was brought out
sjiarply today before the committee
of the American Bar association In
the conflicting views presented bi'
Lieutenant Colonel Samuel T. AnseU,
the officer of the regular army who Is
chief assailant of the system, and
Colonel John Wigmore, temporary of
ficer, widely known as a student of
law in civil life and the most active
defender of the present system in the
absence of Major General Crowder,
judpe advocate general.
"The court martial system does not
. need more law; but more facts,' Col
onel Wigmore asserted, urging that
amendment of the present system to
insure "perfectly fearless counsel foi
the accused" to bring out the facts
would go further toward remedying
such defects as had been disclosed.
Colonel Ansell, resuming his argu
ment, which will not be concluded for
another day, defined the real issue as
the question:
"Whether military Justice is going
to take on an aspect of civil justice?
"If we had legal control from the
beginning of the proceedings," he as
serted after displaying charts show
ing the extensive machinery set up in
the judge advocate general's office to
correct errors, "we would have had
no need for this great revisory "flia
chinery at the top." i
Colonel Wigmore took direct issue
with statements made by Senator
Chamberlain and Colonel Ansell. He
quoted a speech made by Mr. Cham
berlain on the floor of the senate
which declared that the army court
martial system represented neither a
system of justice nor a system of law.
"If any man, after any rational in
quiry whatever, holds to that view,"
Colonel Wigmore declared, "he is
hopeless."
Similarly he challenged Colonel
Ansell's frequently repeated charge
that the military justice system is
"archaic." On the contrary, Colonel
Wigmore declared, there are elements
In the army system so advanced and
modern that men in civil practice can
only dream of the day when they will
be applied in civil courts.
Colonel Ansell entered today upon
the detailed discussion of changes in
law he desires made to accomplish
his main purpose of divorcing the le;
gal aspects of the army completely
from the possibility ot military dom
ination. He. recited figures to show
that 94 per cent of the enlisted men
brought to trial were convicted.
"Either this is a mcst unhumanely
perfect machine," he said, "pt a most
unhumanly unjust one." .
About 30 per cent of the officers are
convicted, Colonel Ansell added, but
continued:
'.'Of course, people In the army are
not going around convicting enlisted
men because they are enlisted men
and acquitting officers because tney
are officers. . That is not true; but
we know that the otficers get better
trials."
AMERICAN MUSICAL
REVUE AT THE
GRAHDJHEATER
The American Musical Revue Is all
that they claim and perhaps a little
more. They present a good, clean snap
py entertainment, neatly produced and
very prettily costumed. They were
greeted with a capacity house at the
Grand last night and if the offerings
to come are on a par with "A Wise
Woman," the production , last night,
they are going to have a record run in
Bisbee.
"A Wise Woman" has plot enough
to carry the interest through the ev
ening and serves as a fitting vehicle
for the interpolation of the many
musical numbers and there wasn't one
last night that was .not heartily en
cored by the audience.
The companv did not come hearald
ed as an all-star cast yet Individually
they are a clever organization. It
would be difficult to say which ; one
was the most popular with the audi
ence. Harry Dale started them go
ing with "The Land of 'Yama Yama,"
and Aileen Walker scored heavily with
"The Hesitation Blues." The La Farra
Sisters got more than their share with
their classy specialties and Billy Coch
ran nearly stopped the show.
, Bud Duncan (himself) the famous
little comedian who we all know in
the films, has a part that fits him
nicely and he puts his stuff over witli
a way all his own that is going to
make him very popular in Bisbee.
The company can be Justly proud of
their chorus, for they are a pretty and
shapely bunch and they certainly can
sing and dance.
The costuming is bright, fresh and
snappy and the whole performance on
a par with the big show scale.
During the engagement here there
will be a new show each night. The
Offering for tonight, being, the laugh
ing hit, "Mary's Ankle." Friday night.
"A Pair of Sixes." Saturday, "The
Mashers," and Sunday night ,the

There will be two shows each night,
7 and 9 o'clock, and the price, lower

Changes in Telephone Rates-1913 o 1918
Compared with Changes in Wages and Price?
1 1NCE 1913 there has been a steady increase in the price of all commodi
ties and the products of industry, which has not been reflected in a
corresponding increase in telephone rates. In order to meet the past
and present -high cost of telephone operation, a revenue in just proportion
to the expense must be secured.

The reason is simple. The cost of telephone operation has steadily ad
vanced both because of the increased cost of material and the increased liv
ing cost of employes. The consumer has realized the necessity of paying
more for rent, for food, for clothing and for transportation. The telephone
industry has been affected by the same conditions which have produced
higher prices in all of the necessities of life. . . , . "
Between 1913 and 1918, commodity prices advanced 112, wages ad
vanced' 72 and Telephone rates the country over advanced only 4.
Adequate rates are needed if the service is to be maintained efficiently and
. on a.comprehensive scale, so as to meet the increasing demands of the public.

the Postmaster General for the United States Government and must secure
sufficient revenue to cover the cost of rendering the service, '

Creating
Moses did not study Freud, but in a crude, primitive way was some
thing of a psychologist. He did not systematize "complexes," but he had
watched the human animal and recognized some of the things to which
he is prone.
So the sage forbade the sacred name of the Deity to be written or
syllabled. No graven image should be made, or idol set up, to impose
its materialities on the senses. The great iconoclast saw that precautions
against anthropomorphism are necessary, is shown in these days by the
habit to anthropomorphize word3. Originally representative' of ideas, they
become word-forms, which have little relation to ideas.
Take for sxaafple, capitalism, now commonly spoken of almost as a
person. This abstraction visualizes itself as a conscious monster, with
cunning eyes, a veracious mouth, an enormous gullet and dollar marks
on itS'Cloflie9..'j Capitalism becomes the embodiment of greed fattened
by the wicked and to be slaughtered by the righteous.
Capitalism, what is it? Like money,, sometimes a standard of
value, sometintes a mediumof exchange, and sometimes a general syno
nym for wealth, capitalism is more than on thing. It is movable
wealth. It is unspent personal income which becomes a general draft
on society. It is the credit that furnishes the foundation of new enter
prises. But in current discussion it has still ancther meaning. Sliding back
to the error of Karl Marx, capital is considered merely an exploiting
mechanism. The capitalist is presented, not as a co-laborer, but as a
parasite who hugs to his bosom a possession which can be taken from
him.. Socialism jargon assumes that capital will continue to exist after
it i confiscated. An evanescent essence, derived from faithnd habit,
which evaporates when faith and habit go, it is talked of as a ponder
able. Capitalism in the last sense is nothing but a practice, with no
separable existence. It is merely a risk-taking, individualistic leadership
in contrast to non-risk-taking co-operation.
A capitalist says to workers: "I propose to make hats, and guaran
tee to you wages while you work with me." Relying on the special skill
of one thU3 williug to make pledges, his hearers commonly take the
jobs and become wage workers. On the other hand, a man arises who
says to his fellows: "Let's join together and make hats on common
agent- If we do well, we are to share alike; if we don't do well, no
one will get anything."
The two methods of production have long been in competition. Which
method dees the average man prefer? General experience shows he pre
fers a certainty and believes that a skilful leader wilt divide more in
wages than comes to the members of the co-operative group. No law
forbids co-operation, yet it is exceptional. Men seldom remain long
with a cc-operative - undertaking. The private plant as a rule offers
them more.
Capitalistic leadership, rather than capital, Leninc hammers at. He
knows when cerdits' are destroyed there is little to divide, and that of the
remainder little is movable; that a rifling of the treasure house of
capital, therefore, means but a microscopic dividend. He is concerned
about production, and he learns that an elected committee does not run
things well. He cries out for experts, promising high remuneration, ,
which is, of course, the old system under another name. To keep himself
in power he keeps beating his tomtoms, hoping to woo attention from dis
agreeable facts.
In Petrograd are the iPutiloff words. Suppose their old owner
appeared and was allowed ( to .eay: . "Now I propose to run the plant,
provided I am permitted." After twelve months of co-operative manage
ment what would the men answer? Lenine knows, hence his refusal
to consent to the existence of conditions under which it could be made.
Yet the habit of attributing to capitalism qualities which were not
in the system, but in men, will doubtless continue. It is so easy to be
fluent thus. ,
The People Pay the Bills
Another $65,000,000 has been added to the payrolls of the railroads
by the director general, bringing the total yearly salary lists to three
billions of dollars, as compared with twp billions sixteen months ago.
Aggregate advances of $040 per man are included in the grand total for
each of the two million employes, while the average raise of members
of the "Big Four" reaches about $690 per man. ,
We believe that the workman should receive fair return for his labors
that high wages should prevail; that the welfare of the United States de
pends on the condition financially and socially of its Working classes;
that the age of peonage has disappeared and the day of the independent
American arrived; that every concession within bounds of reason should
be made to the man who toils.
But is, this raise in salaries for railroad employes justified? Reports
of the railroad administration for the pats year's operations! showed a
gigantic loss in revenue, both from freight -and passenger service. In
creases aggregating 822 millions of dollars had already been made in.
wages. Practically every class of railroad labor had profited through
these increases.
Wages in other trades are not being increased. In the east textile
mills are forced to curtail their production, to cut down" their forces and
decrease their W3gp Bcales. Here in Ariozna copper miners are working
on a basi3 of low-price dcopper with a wage below that prevailing dur
ing the war. Other branches of the national, business have suffered
equally.
And the man and woman who is working under these post-conflict
conditions, who is holding down a job in curtailed industry at lower
wages, is the man and woman who must pay the taxes to be eaten up in
advances to railroad employes. .
Sooner or later this country anticipates the return of the railroads
to their former owners. In due time the country expects a return to
normal, productive times, the arrival of the period of reconstruction.
Handicapped by the railroad administration's policy of wage increase, the
companie.will find more than difficult adjusting themselves to normal
conditions, and the people who pay the taxes which have supported
these wage' Increases, will suffer more delays and hardships.
While the conditions may be justified, the attitude of the railroad ad
ministration hardly seems fair to the people. , While two millions bqnefit
in the advances, the remaining millions pay the bills. And prosperity
and higher wages for the remaining millions are indefinitely delayed.
One reascn why the Chinese objected to recognition of the Monroe
Doctrine in the league constitution was because Japan will interpret it
as recognition of her doctrine in the Orient.

WOULD PAVE APACHE TRAIL
PHOENIX, April 23. That the
Apache trail should be paved was the
opinion expressed by United States
Senator Mark Smitn iollowing an au
tomobile trip with John L. Irvinr reg
ister of the land office, recently.
It Is a disgrace," the well known
Arizonan remarked, "for the; most
beautiful scenic highway In the United 1
States to be left in such a poor con-1
ditlon. There are 40 miles of road
running through the national forest re-
serve, and I think that the government
ought to be willing to pave its prop-
erty."
Senator Smith said that when he got I
back to Washington he was going to I
see if this could not be done, and he
roughly estimated the cost at $200,000, 1
or thereabouts. On the trip over the !
Apache trail to Roosevelt, Senator
Smith was the guest of John L. Irvin.
and the party made the trip to thelto
dam in seven hours each way, which I
is considered as fast as it is safe and i
comfortable to travel with the roads
in their present condition, but, were 1
they paved, four hours would be ample
time in which to make the trip. I

his attention was called to the fact '
that the migratory bird law makes it I
prohibitive to shoot wild ducks In
February, he said this law should be
changed until a later month since the
big ducks do not come to Arizona un
til February and that in very limited
numbers. He said that it was the in
tention of the makers of the game
laws to provide sportsmen with a cer
tain amount of shooting so long as it
did 'not interfere with the breeding
if the birds and animals.
VERDE TO HAVE NEW HIGH '
JEROME. April 23 The much ro-
bated question. of the type of high
school that should be provided for the
Verde district seems now to be in a
fair way towards solution and there is
a probability that) the opposiifg views
held by many . good citizens, all of
whom have only the best interests of
the schools at heart, will be recon
ciled.
It is understood that two of the
leading educators of the state, Presi
dent von Klein Smid of the state uni
versity and Supt. C. F. Philbrook of
Bisbee, have been asked to come to
Jerome to make a thorough survey of
the educational needs of the district
and that unop their report will depend
in large measure the action to be tak
en by the trustees.
It is claimed by the opponents oi
the building of a high school in Je
rome that what the district really
heeds is a consolidated institution de
signed tq serve the entire Verde dis
trict and that such a school has many
advantages over three small schools
each with its own staff of teachers and
educational equipment. The advo
cates of a consolidated school say
that a single institution serving the
same number of pupils would he more
economical and also infinitely more
efficient, as the size of the school
would enable its trustees to secure
teaching talent of a high grade and
the very best of equipmeut at a saving
to the taxpayers owing to the wider
distribution of the expense burden.
To get more HgiH op the' question,
a letter was sent to C. A. McDoiialu
of Bisbee, clerk of the high school
board there, askiu'g him to answer a
certain list of questions.

an inspection of the company's mines
and plants in tae district, departed
yesterday, accompanied by General
Manager Norman Carmichael.
The personnel of the party included
George Roadman, chairman of the
board of directors; Alexander Mc-
Nabb and Sir-David Paulin, members I
of the board.
Mr. Readmau, chairman of the
board, stated that as a result of th,eir
visit, they would recommend various
Improvements to the board, and that
General Manager Carmichael would
no doubt soon be able, to make them
public, although it must be reaizea
that the present is not an opportune
time for "heavy expenditures and ex
pansion in their copper Industry for
the reason that the copper product
was practically unsalable and was be
ing piled up by the producers await
ing a return of normal pre-war condi
tions. Mr.-McNabb stated that the labor
situation in Great Britain was a prob
lem to be worked out carefully and
considered the unrest and unsettled
condition in that country greater ,than
in the United States, and insofar as
the high cost of living is concerned,
he had learned since his arrival in the
United States, that even wearing ap
parel can now be bought cheaper' in
New York than in London.
Although the coining of the direc
tors did not have any bearing on the
matter, while they were in the dis
trict the Metcalf mine of the' com
pany, located at Metcalf, as well as
the Coronado,. were completely closed
down. The closing ot these mines was
followed by the shut-down of concen
trator No. 4 at Clifton, which handles
ore exclusively from the Metcalf. This
action on the rart of the A. C. com
pany at Metcalf was preceded several
weeks ago by similar action on the
part of the Shannon Copper compauy,
with the result that with the exception
of some work being done on claims
by leasers, the Metcalf mining district
is idle and several hundred men are
out ot employment.

U. S. GOV'T. WITHOUT HEAD
PHOENIX. April 23. On the after-3
noon or April 30, 1919, the Uniteu
States of America was for a period of
several hours absolutely without any
nominal head of the government.
President Wilson was in Paris, Secre
tary of State Lansing, third in com
mand, was also in the French capital,
and Vice-Pres. Thomas R. Marshall,
second mate of the ship of state, was
over in Juarez, Mexico, under the
chaperonage of A. A. Betts of this city.
Thus for the first time in the history
of the United States the president,
the vice-president and the secretary of
state were all absent from the terrain
over which floats the red, white and
llue.
.The absence of Wilson and Lansing
was of course necessitated by their
participation in the peace conference,
vut Vice-President Marshall happened
to stray away from the home land
principally because Corporation Com
missioner Betts discovered . the vice
president and his-wife in El Paso, the
Marshalls being on their way back to
Washington after their sojourn in the
Salt River valley, and their arrival in
the Pass City having been prior to
that time unknown to the local resi
dents. .
Betts, who was in El Paso after hav
ing attended the W. O. W. convention
at Deming, New Mexico, happened on
to the . vice-president in a manner
quite unexpected, and at once proceed
ed to wise up the El Pasoans to the
fact that they had a -distinguished
citizen within their gates. A luncheon
was hastily arranged for at the Shel
don hotel, and following this affair,
if was decided to take Mr. and Mrs.
Marshall over the line into Juarez, the
vice-president having never before
visited that Mexican metropolis. The
Mexican military authorities were
overjoyed at being given the privilege
of entertaining the American official
and his party, and upon their arrival
across the border General Mora, tu
federal commander, personally took
charge of the party and entertained
the visitors in a lavish manner. .A
band concert by one of he finest con
cert organizations south of the line
completed the affair, and following the
return to the United States the Mar
shalls resumed their eastward trjp,
Mr. Marshall being billed to deliver a
loan speech at Dallas this evening.
Betts came on to Phoenix, arriving
here this morning.
GOOD WORK BY JUNIOR R. C.
MESA, April 23. One hundred ana
forty-five cans of fruit and glasses of
jeliy and 14 "boxes of flowers wen.
shipped to Ft. Whipple, Prescott, Sat-i
urday by the Junior Red Cross. The
fruit was first shipped to Phoenix
there to be transshipped to the desti
nation. The school children have re
sponded most nobly to the call for
fruit and flowers for the sick soldiers.
The flowers were most beautiful, and
a bouquet placed near the cot of the
boys who have made tremendous sac
rifices will remind them beautifully
that others are thinking of them.
SHOOTING FATAL TO LAD
LEHI, April 23. The 6-year-old son
of Richard Miller, who was shot
through the temple with a .22 caliber
rifle last Friday, died at the family
home on Saturday and the funeral was
held on Sunday afternoon. The shoot
ing took place while an uncle of the
child was examining the gun, being
under the impression that the gun was
not loaded. The ball entered the child's
left temple and came out at the base
of the brain. How the little victim
lived so long the attending physician
was unable to state.
GAMBLERS FLEECE

PHOENIX, April 23. Upon com
plaint of Yaqui tribesmen that their
young men were being relieved of
their money and other earthly posses

Deputy Sheriff Jim Troutman,- with
the assistance Of Indian officers, this
morning arrested Frales, Onero and
Cammillo Valenzuela, Mexicans, in the
hills about a mile from where the big
dance is now in progress on the Yaqui
reservation.
The complaint was made early yes
terday, after numerous young Indians
had gone to the sequestered gambling
den in the hills and returned broke,
the tribesmen saying "money lasted
quick."' and that the Mexican gamb
lers played a "dead sure game."

WALSH, P ID EER OF
'
BISBEE, DIES IN CALIF.
J. J. Walsh, an old resident of Bis
bee, familiarly known as "Daddy"
Walsh, died Tuesday evening at a
hospital in Riverside, Cal.
Mr. Walsh held large property in
terests locally and at one time was
proprietor of the Office saloon, under
the firm of Whaley, Walsh & Downs.
- He served as a member of the cit
council under the Adams administra
tion, having been elected as council
man from the second ward in June,
1914. On January 12, 1915, he ten
dered his resignation, which was ac
cepted. Deceased was a member of the
Elks' lodge and other fraternal or
ganizations and was reputed to be
wealthy.
Funeral arrangements have not
been learned, but it is regarded prob
able by friends that the body will bt
brought to Bisbee for interment.
and Valenzuela were playing a sort ot
a draw poker game with several In
dians and that the game seemed to be
rather a one-sided affair in which the
Mexicans always seemed to win. They
were placed in the county jail on a
charge of gaming.
STABBEQ IN DISPUTE
TEMPE, April 23 In a dispute over
the right of way near the Tempe
Yaqui Indian reservation late Satur
day night, F. J. Hill was stabbed and
is now in St. Joseph's hospital, while
Dan Frank, his opponent in the argu
ment, is in the county jail.
A charge of driving an automobile
while drunk has been placed against
Hill by the sheriff. Frank is held in
connection with the stabbing of Hill.
The knife entered Hill's body on the
left side, penetrating his lung, accord
ing to the sheriffs report.
The two men were arrested by
Deputy Sheriffs Troutman and Blanco
of Phoenix, and Wood of Tempe.
Frank, according to the arresting of
ficers, told them Hill was on the
wrong side of the road when the two
cars came together and that led to the
dispute.

U. S. Instructs Revenue Men
to Remove Seals From
Brewery Pipe Lines
NEW YORK, April 23. Coincident
with an announcement by United
States District Attorney Caffey that
he had received no instructions from
Washington to prosecute brewers dis
tributing beer of 2 3-4 per cent alco
hol content in violation of food con
servation regulations promulgated by
the internal revenue department, gov
ernment counsel stated here today
that the department had taken steps
to permit resumption of beer bottling.
Collectors throughout the countrji
have been directed, it was stated, to
unseal the locks on brewer pipe
lines, which have remained idle since
brewing was forbidden by presidential
proclamation December 1 last.
The two announcements were made
in federal court in the course of an
argument on the government's motion
to dismiss the brewers' suit to restrain
official interference with the produc
tion of 2 3-4 per cent brew, alleged to
be non-intoxicating. Speculation re
sulted as to whether the government's
attitude, including authorization made
earlier this week, of the sale of rev
enue stamps hitherto denied the manu
facturers, would continue after the
war-time prohibition act becomes ef
fective next Thursday. District At
torney Caffey and Special United
States Attorney Fitts, appearing for
Attorney General Palmer in the in
junction proceedings, declared they
had no knowledge of the course to be
pursued when the emergency act,
forbidding manufacture after April 30
and sale after June 30 of "beer, wine
and other intoxicatiug malt or vinous
beverages" goes into operation.
The internal revenue departments
reversal of it3 earlier attitude, which
had been based on a ruling that bee?
of 1-2 of 1 per cent or greater alco
holic content was intoxicating and so
forbidden, under the modified regula
tions effective early this year permit
ting production of "near bear," was
brought out during the argument be
fore Judge A. N. Hand of William
D. Guthrie, jr., counsel with Elihu
Root for the United States Brewers'
association.

GLOBE, Ariz.', April 23. Tranq'ui
lino Martinez ' was killed tonight at
Miami, . following a quarrel over a
girl with another Mexican.
Miguel Vasquez, alleged slayer, is
still at large, following a careful 1
search of the Globe-Miami district by
authorities. Inasmuch as persons'
who witnessed the shooting claim
that four shots were fired and a- gun
with one discharged cartridge was
found beside the body of the dead
man, authorities' are of the opinio
that a duel took place.
MILITARY PARTY IN f
JAPAN IS WORSTED!
WASHINGTON, April 23 Official
advices received here today said the
war party in the Japanese cabinet had
yielded to the liberals in the Siberian
policy and Foreign Minister Count
Uchida would direct the handling ot
the situation. This development, it is
said, marks the passage of the most
serious crisis that has been faced by
Premier Hara's cabinet.
: One result expected is recognition
of the Omsk government as the de
facto government of all non-bolshevik
Russia by Japan at the same time this
recognition is accorded by the United
States, Great Britain, France and Italy,
which is looked for soon after the ad-(

YOU FAILED TO BUY OCEAN YOU NOW HAVE THE CHANCE TO BUY RANGER CENTRAL
THE TWIN SISTER J. A. D. SMITH IS THE FATHER OF BOTH
This is the adjoining ten acres to Ocean. The Norwood well flowing 1 4,000 barrels and producing $30,
000 a day for its owners, is a little over a mile east, was brought in last week, producing 1 2,000 barrels a day,
and the top of. the sand ha sbeen barely penetrated. v
Have you investigated anything better ? There is little chance to lose. The geologists say that this is the
same "formation as the Norwood, Roper and Sun wells. The Norwood' is worth $1 0,000,000. It cost them
less than the Ranger Central. The nearer these monsters come, the larger they are.
, MANAGEMENT
J. A. D. Smith, the best liked and most prosperous oil man in the Texas fields, is our President, also of
the Oceon. He js a 100 winner. He is also president of the well known Lone Star Refining Company. He
is a producer, refiner and practical oil man, and has made Five Millions out of oil. -You are dealing with
winners. You are placing your confidence with experienced and responsible men. Mr. Smith backs no
losers. When you back him one-half of your success is assured.
The contract to drill is already let to "Lucky" J. C. Smith, the man known in the oil fields as never hav
sponsible oil and business men. You are casting your lot with experienced and reing drilled a dry hole.
DRILLING AT ONCE
What you want for your money is dividends. That is what you are investing for. The machinery is on
the ground. The money is being advanced by the officers. They believe in it and are advancing the money
to show you the confidence they have in it. The derrick is being built and before your stock certificate
reaches you the drill will be pounding down. In sixty or ninety days we will have oil. We mean business.
This .is the stock you want to buy. REMEMBER THE "OCEAN." Get in before it is too late. The same
oil men are backing both deals.
. THE GOLDEN HARVEST
Never before was there such opportunities as oil presents. Millionaires are made overnight. All the
large 'companies started like ourselves. I Who knows where wre will stop? Come in with us and if we win,
you will be with us in our future operations.
You can't meet a man, woman or child who is not talking, thinking or buying oil stock, and rightfully
for millions are being made. Here is your chance.
SUCCESS SEEMS CERTAIN
Practically ninety per cent of the wells drilled in this neighborhood are gushers real gushers. They are
not pumpers or small producers. It seems we can't lose. There are no small wells in the field.
A two thousand barrel well will double your money each month. And who knows but what we may
strike another Norwood. Geologists say our location is the same. Your One Dollar will then be worth Fifty
Dollars and we intend to drill five wells. Figure then what your dollar share will be worth.
ACTION
What you want is action and that is what you are going to get. Dividends will be paid monthly to
stockholders. We do not have other tracts scattered all over Texas on which to waste ycur dividends. We
offer you a one hundred per cent winner in a proven field, backed by one hundred per cent successful oil
men.- Here is your place to invest in a real proven field. ..
RECORD BREAKER
'Thi3 property ia the adjoining tract to the now "famous" Ocean Oil and Refining Company. Its stock
was forty thousand dollars over-subscribed in three weeks. PEOPLE HAD CONFIDENCE IN OCEAN.
They also have in this. Those who lost out on Ocean now have an opportunity. Take your cue from Ocean.
Don't wait too late. Several thousand who wanted Ocean didn't get it.
PRACTICALLY SAME OFFICERS IN RANGER CENTRAL AS IN OCEAN
J. A. D. Smith is President of both companies and Wilson C. Porterfield is Secretary and Treasurer of
each. Watch us break another record. ,

Let a can of white enamel lie loose around the household

That female curiosity akin

to try out "a little dab here

lining of the Ice chest, "just
to see if it will make much of

box has a new petticoat. One
thing leads to another. She tries a few touches on the bath
room tiling. From there to the bedroom woodwork, then to
the wicker chairs. All get the same finish as the ice box!
When that's all done, and there's just a brushful left in the

"KISS OR KILL"
AMAZING CROOK PLAY"
AT EAGLE TODAY
He was being pursued by the police.
In his pocket was a large wallet
that had belonged to a prosperous
looking individual only a few minutes
before. He had not wanted to steal;
he V hated to be 'considered a thief.
But he had been hungry and his land
lady had threatened to exit him.
Suddenly he thought of a trick em
ployed by crooks in escaping the law.
It had been demonstrated to him by
a noted criminal who had fought
shoulder to shoulder with' him against
the Huns. He ...flattened himself
against a door and the police dashed
by without seeing, him.
The door yielded and Henry Warner
found himself in the home of Old Man
GREATEST OF SENNETT
COMEDIES IS COMING
TO EAGLE THEATER
Every Sennett face and figure that !
has come to national fame through
the productions of the king of film
comedy will be seen in Sennett's
greatest production greater even
than his recent screen sensation
"Mickey" a burlesque on German
royalist pretensions entitled "Yankee '
Doodle in Berlin," which comes to the !
Eagle theater soon.
This is the first time since "Fatty (
and the Broadway Stars," by the same
producer, that he has permitted his
whole array of stellar talent to appear
in one comedy. It includes Charlie
Murray, Ben Turpin, Ford Sterling,'
Marie Prevost, Phyllis Haver, Ches
ter ; Conklin, Eva Thatcher, Bert
Roach, the famous bunch of California
rosebuds, the Sennett bathing beau
ties, and (specially engaged) Bothwell
Browne, noted impersonator of female
characters, who. 1b the pivotal point of
the fun. .
; Browne, as an American aviator in
reminine disguise, "vamps" Wllhelm,
the safety-first Clown Prince, Hin
denburg and other court figures, gets
"the papers," and returns safely to
America.
The usual Sennett comedy is In two
reels. "Yankee Doodle in Berlin"' Is in
five, and is called an hour of con
tinuous hilarity. . Adv.

Midcueton. mis experience bad un
nerved him and he was for going out
and giving himself up, but he knew
such a. course meant a long jail term.
In such a mental condition he yielded
to a proposition by Old Man Middle
ton that he undertake a dangerous
mission.
In "Kiss or Kill," which appears at
the Eagle theater today Warner's ex
periences and those of a beautiful girl
form one of the most thrilling yet ap
pealing stories yet shown on I the
screen. ; ; ' Adv.
Mai-y Pickford plays two parts in
"Stella Maris," the Artcraft picture
being exhibited at the Lyric theater
today,- one delicate, and dainty, and
the othy, as Unity Blake, uncouth
and unlovely, but carrying with it a
tremendous amount of pathos. - In
several scenes, as Unity Blake, Mary
Pickford causes the feminine audience
to reach for its handkerchiefs and en
joy a sood cry. .
Many people will wonder how such
a scene is worked up, and the atmo
sphere created in a studio. Director
Marshall Neilan, who produced the
picture, tells us the secret.
"Miss Pickford is a splendid
actress," says Neilan, "ind brimful of
temperament. As Unity," the abused
slave whom John Risca ha3 rescued
from the cruelties of his half-insane
wife, her.make-up was so perfect that
when she walked onto the studio floor
no one recognized her. ' . ;
"In the big emotional scene Unltey
stands alone in Risca's' living room
and looks at the' picture of Stella
Maris, a contrast with Unity's hbmely
face and twisted body. She loves
John and John loves Stella Marls. Arid
Unity breaks down and weeps, and
real tears roll down her cheeks arid
her deformed shoulders writhe. ; .
' "Behind a screen are stationed
pianist and two violinists, and as
Mary, .thoroughly submerged in her
part, proceeds with her acting, the
musicians play sympathetic music,
aud' the Wailing violins fairly sob un
til the climax, when the music reaches
an agonized shriek.
"When this scene was taken, every
one in the studio broke down and
cried." Adv.

MANY DESERT FROM
ARMY OF BOLSHEVIKI
LONDON. April 23 Large quanti
ties of material were abandoned by
the Bolshevik! when they were driven
out of Bolshie Ozerki recently, accord
ing to the report of Major General
Edmond Ironside, British commission
er in chief on the ArilianKt-I lror., re
garding the operation. His report con
tinues: "We captured two field guns, lono
r:und8 of throe-inch ammunition, and
piisouers. The spirit of the troop
taking part was excellent and they
have done exceedingly well."
Regarding the geiu-ral situation,
General Ironside says:
"Dosertors from the Bolshevik
forces have joined our own and the
Russian troops. They openly show
their hatred of the bolshevik! and bear
witness to the hard conditions of ser
vice. Tliis has done more than any
thing ele to tou-olidat. the new Rus

STOCKS AND BODS
NEW YORK, April 23. Factors
which contributed measurably to the
strength and activity of yesterday's
stock market, notably the confident
buying of rails, were operative
again today reinforced by a keen in
quiry for other popular shares, partic
ularly steels, coppers and numerous
equipments. United States Steel was
the central feature at an extreme
gain of 2 points to 103, though los
ing all but a large fraction in the ex
tensive profit taking of the last hour.
The rise in rails was again restrict
ed mainly to low grade issue of the
western and southwestern sections.
Aside from Royal Dutch, oils were
uncertain. '
Tobaccos, fertilizers, food special
ties and a variety of miscellaneous is
sues forfeited much of the variable
gains at slight pressure, an irregular
tone prevailing at the active ' close.
Sales amounted to 1,700,000 shares,
which sets a high water mark for the
year to date. '
Bonds, Including Liberty issues,
were firm, but featureless. Total
sales, par value, aggregated $11,875,
000. Old United States registered 4's
rose per cent on sales.
GRAIN MARKET
CHICAGO, April 23. Big advances
in the corn market today with trad
ing on a broad scale resulted to a
great extent from a jump in the
value of hogs to the highest price
ever known, $21.15 a hundredweight.
The close in corn was at the topmost
point reached, a net gain of 3c tc
5c a bushel with July $61.62 to
$1.62. and September $1.59 to
$1.59. Oats finished lc to lc
up, and provisions showing a rise of
12 to 55c.
All deliveries of corn quickly w.ent
above any previous quotations this
season and despite heavy profit tak
ing sales kept on the upgrade, almost
unchecked throughout the day.
Oats were hoisted by the same
forces that governed corn. f
Much activity as well as strength
developed in provisions owing to rec
ord" breaking advance of hogs and
corn. May lard jumped to $31.00 per
hundred, a new tip top.
' THE METAL MARKET
NEW YORK, April 23. Lead was
steady; spot, $4.755.00; May $4.80
500; spelter, steady; spot East St

THE COTTON MARKET
NEW YORK, April 23. Cotton

JAPAN WANTS TO JOIN
LEAGUE WIN OR LOSE
TOKIO, April 23. (By the 'Asso
ciated Press.) The impression exists
in well informed quarters here that
Japan will join the league of nations
even if the racial clause of the league
covenant is finally rejected by the
peace conference. This was brought
out in answer to special news dis
patches from Paris asserting that
Japan had informed the other dele
gates to the conference that Japan
would decline to enter the league if
the racial clause was not adopted.
BAD BREATH
Putt Stomach in Fine Condition Lax-
carin Tablets Get at the Cause
and Removes Bad Breath.
Laxcarin tablets for which there is
no substitute of any worthy considera
tion, act gently on the bowels and posi
tively do the work.
People afflicted with bad breath find
quick relief through Laxcarin tablets.
The pleasant chocolate coated tablets
are taken by all who know not
only for bad breath but for the cause
of bad breath itself which is most
usually caused by stomach disorders
such as indigestion, soury and gasy
stomach, where there is much bloat
ing of gases, etc., etc. Laxcarin tab
lets are also very good for constipa
tion, whether it is a. chronic case or
whether it may be only occasional.
Laxcarin gently forces the bowels to
move at the same time compels the
toxins, and other poisons which ac
cumulate in 'the bowels and the kid
neys to leave the system. Laxcarin
stimulates the bowels and the . nver
Into natural action, clearing the blood
and gently purifying the entire sys
tem. . Laxcarin does this work witn-
out any danger, and without any bad
effects which are usually caused by
others.
All the benefits of nasty, sickening,
griping cathartics are derived from
Laxcarin tablets without griping, pain
or any disagreeable effects.
Laxcarin tablets formula Is not a
secret preparation, and the same form
ula is being used by thousands ana
thousands of physicians all over the
world. Only so far it has been ob
tainable only by physicians' prescrip
tions. It is the prescription of a very
famous professor.
Laxcarin is a purely vegetable com
pound you will like them after a trial.
Will never want to be without it. It
is really a very good family laxative.
It is best to order enough for a full
treatment at once, which is six boxes
for ?5, as on account of the very
changing market conditions and on ac
count of the many repeat orders we
are hardly able to fill the orders. One
box is only $1 and it is worth a mil
lion more to the sufferer because it
relieves and because it works like a
clock. Will be sent upon receipt of re
mittance "post paid Laxcarin Products

CANANEA MAN HERE
FROM SERVICE WITH
ALLIES IN BELGIUM
C. M. Gabrielsonj -of Cananea ha3
just returned to this district from
France and Belgiunf, where he was
in action with the Canadian troops,
eifgineers. He was mustered cut at
Vancouver and came directly here.
Ho goes to Cananea todayt Before en
listing he was engaged in the mining
business there.
Mr. Gabrielson had an opportunity
of gaining a first-hand impression of
the Belgian territory relinquished by
the Germans under) the pressure cf
the last big British 'push. He spent
several days in Brussels after the
armistice was signed, and says that
it is apparent that the Huns did not
have any idea of releasing their hold
cn that city, as is evidenced by the
fact that they did not remove the
brass and copper fixtures from the
public buildings, churches and private
houses, as they did' in the other parts
of Belgium, in the first lust of con
quest during the early months of the
war. When at las.t they were forced
out of Brussels - they had to leave
in such a hurry that they could not
do their customary damage.
While the residents of Brussels are
a3 different from the rest of the Bel
gians as the Parisian is from the
Frenchman of the provinces, never
theless it was apparent that the pe.o
ple of Belgium can be divided into
two distinct classes the minority,
who have more than tolerated the
presence of the invaders, and . have
been in sympathy with them, and the
big majority that have not. Of course
those that have been loyad feel very
bitterly toward those that have not,
and it is certain that this sharp mark
ing off will continue for years to
come. The people of Brussels, who
are very intelligent and progressive,
as a rule were overjoyed with the
success of the Allies.
