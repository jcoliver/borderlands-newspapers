1 "The Germans can out-hell hell."
declared Dr. B. B. Von KleinSmid,
president of the University of Arizona,
in the-final address of the Warren
District's Liberty Day program, which
concluded last evening at 7:30 o'clock
following an afternoon of the ' most
Intense patriotic fervor ever displayed
in this community. As the university
president uttered his epigramatie de
scription or the Prussian frightful
ness in this war, as he painted In
words of vivid realism the horrors of
the Hun, the evening rounds of shots
on Sacramento hill broke onto the
air. The realism of battle in the dis
tance, of the booming of guns along
the ploe drawn lins of Flanders
and Picardy, came before the miuds
of the massive audience which filled
the City park. An emphasis on which
the speaker had not relied for effect
had been added to his word paintings,
hf.d added strength to his denuncia
tions of Prussianism end made clear
er his mesepge that Americans must
five their all to. the protection of a
birthright of higher ideals and greater
civilization and democracy.
Liberty Day in the Warren District
was recognized with the greatest" dem
onstration in the history of the com
munity. From 1 o'clock in the aft?r
noon until almost dark, business stood
at a standstill while men, women and
children, celebrated the coming t this
district and this county of Honor
Flags in the third Liberty loan. Near
ly every business house of the entire
district closed its doors. Several
thousands of people took part in two i
parades. Thousands of others lined i
ine siuewa'Ks to witness the demon
stration. And on the presentation of
ttvo patrfc. in programs- in tb City
park, benches in the nark would not
hold the audience, the park its?lf
would not hold the crowd, and the
overflow was forced to bang over the
iron fence above the park to hear and
see.
And the Liberty flag floated over
Bisbee and the Warren District.
President's Address
Dr. Von KleinSmid opened bis ad
dress, which was the principle talk
of the day. with a compliment to the
people of the-Warren District for their
work in behalf of the government. He
declared the fame .of the district has
gone out over the state, and he ex
pressed his confidence that the dis
trict and county will reach the goal
they have set in their drive to double
the quota of bonds assigned to this
division.
The speaker called attention to the
unity in purpose which has been weld
ed in this great nation in the year
since war was declared. In the next
breati he warmed against the com-
piamer, against tne man ana woman
who is continually trying to hamper '
the. government in its work. p
Democracy was born to Europe, said
the speaker, in 1S48, when there swept ;
over France. Italy, Switzerland, and;
Austria, a new ideal of government.

General Delma Radcliffe, chief direc

a realization that the whole Ypres po

ALL DISTRICT
CELEBRATES
LIBERTY DAY
iContlnued from Pase One)
From this dawn of democracy France
was baptized to a great future. Italy,
Switzerland, and Austria, and even
Germany, said the speaker, felt the
game wave. Bismark was called on
to staunch the spirit in Germany.
Again a few years later and still again
was he called on for similar services,
and each time he did his work faith
fully and fully.
"And today," said Dr. Von Klein
Smid, it is the spirit of Bismark which
is trying to stamp out the spirit cf
democracy."
The speaker referred to his Ger
man extraction, and to the exodus
from Germany of those who had
sought in their own land, democracy,
but were forced to flee to anDther
count rv to establish the ideals fsr

grandfather who had '-'snapped his
lingers in the face of the kaiser," and
come to America to make his higher
ideals safe for bis children and their
children.
"Yours the Same Glory"
"Yours is the same glory yours is
the same duty," he declared. "It is
yours to sustain the higher ideals cf
this democracy and civilization for
which your forelathers fought and
bled."
Dr. Von KleinSmid then traced the
spirit of Germany from the time of
Bismark, showing how the people bad
been reared with the inhere! belief
that they were to govern the world,
how the autocratic heads of the gov
ernment had made even their own
people subserviant to this end, and
bow they had boasted that after
France had been done away with, al
ter England and Italy and Belgium
had been subdued and Russia con
quered, then would be ample time to
"take care of that measly little hand
ful of states." He pointed to the pre
posteTDusitsss of ithe boast that a
country of 65,000,000 persons should
rule a world. And yet, he declared,
with all the forces arrayed against
them, the kaiser now holds in his
hand the destinies of 170,000.000
people.
Of course, said the doctor, the Ger
inans will not rule the world.
"That will not happen, and I say it
because of the faith I have In the

"It is America returned to- pay her
debt of gratitude," said the speaker;
"it is America reaching out a helping
band to Layfayette and the men and
women who are suffering, to retain
the gift of democracy."
The speaker closed to thunderous
throngs which lined the sidewalk from
the upper end of Main street to the
plaza.
The girls of Miss Riley's private
school, the Camp Fir Girls in their
costumes, a company of the high
school cadets, high school and junior
high, pupils and the grade pupils
formed the majority of the remaining
procession. At the rear were the
applause from 'an audience which had 1 mayor and city officials, grey headed

his head with a. wide brimmed felt

under the extreme handicap of an out
of door audience which, was uncom
fortable in the sun and without seats,
and which teemed with the super-human
activitfea of several hundreds of
childre-i who had taken part in the
great parade which preceded his ap
pearance. In spite of the handicap
he was able to reach the ears of the
several thousand persons who had as
semble'! hi the city park, and to draw
from them time and aagin expressions
of approbation and loud applause.
The afternoon program opened with
a parade from the Doyle house on Up-
ments of the city and county. He
explain' xl that the Honor Flag had
been raised in Bisbee in recognition
of the district's oversubscription. He
declared the driva will now be con

subscribed one nitllton dollars, and
that In the county, which also has been
over pledged, the aim of the committee
now is for $2,000.000 almost twice the
original allotment.

several selections.

the patriotic appeal "Joan of Arc," one
of the meat beautiful of the war songs

was followed by J. A. Rancourt. who

ered chiefly in speculative issues. :.iizoria Commercial .,. .
Low priced specialties hitherto neg
lected were taken up by pools at
sains of 1 to 2 points, the rise in
isolated Instances extending- to great
er lengths. Representative industrials
an drails moved only moderately, al
though United States Steel and Read
ing scored extreme gains of a point.
Anion gthe more noteworthy changes
were Superior Steel, Malting pre
ferred, corn products and Philadephia
company at gains of 2Yj to' 4 points.
Tobaccos, Motors and Oils also hard
ened. Offsetting: features included
Gulf States steel at a recession of

Sales amounted to 150,000 shares.
General market developments em
braced another sharp break In Italian
exchange, lyres approached their low
record at 8-96. The recurrent weak

to speculation in bills on Rome.
The February statement of the

among the other features of general

CHICAGO April 26. Prospects for
a smaller acreage together with un
favorable weather gave the corn mar
ket today a decided upward swing.
Trices closed firm, to 2 cents net
higher, with May 127 and July 153
to 15314. Oats finished unchanged to
up and provisions varying from 20
cents decline to a rise of 25 cents.
Expected reduction of corn acreage
was ascribed largely to the continued
plpntlng and to shortage of seed corn.
It was said also that increases of
winter wheat an doats acreage had
been to a material degree at the ex
pense of corn. Besides receipts today
were not large, and were sold readily
at full prices, low grades in particular
being in excellent demand for dis
tilling purposes. ' Despite the fact that
considerable realizing on the part of
the holders was encountered, no im
portant setbacks took place, notwi'.h-
' standing comparative weakness of
oats. ,
The outlook for oats seemed to be
for the largest acreagft on record.
Slowness of eastern demand acted
as a decided handicap on the bulls,
and checked sympathy with the up

The old Dry Lake that has been a
desert spot in the Sulphur Springs
valley since the history of man run
ning not to the contrary, is about to '
become a hive o Industry, and what ,
has always been considered a wa it - j
may become one of the most promis
ing and thriving business industries
in the state gf Arizona and in the
Vnited States.
A company of fourteen prominent
mining men of this district and Dow?
las nre behind the enterprise to sin':
test wells it the dry; lake in the
alkali for potassium. The applications
of the-members of the company have
already been filed in the land office
at Phoenix aj)d the placer location
notices filed in the recorders office at
Tombstone. Each application is filed
for a claim of 2.5t".0 acres. The land
U located rbout three miles east .f
Cochise and lies on both sides of the
Southern Pacific railroad. There are
still thousands of acres that" have not
been filed on and should the present
company make eood, there is n; doubt
that others will engage in similar
enterprises.
The applicants from this district
are: William B. Ghoring. W. E. Mc
Kee, Arthur Honle, Joe E. Curry. Geo.
Jav. Bm II. Wolf: Capt. J. P. Hogd-
son. Vr7 X. C. Bledsoe, Arthur Not-!
mnn, L C. Shattuck and Walter II. j
Gage. The Douglas men interested i
".re Wi'iMam Childers, I. J. Ward av1
O. J. Hurley.
The method of 'development pro
poned Is to. sink test wells and from
the brine collecting in the wells to
extract the potassium, t'p to the pre
ent war Germany furnished all the
potassium the world needed. Now
Nebraska has successfully taken n
the Industry, and prominent geologists
claim that the conditions In Willeox
lake are identical with those in
Nebraska. '

ETERNAL TEMPTRESS
CENRAL TOCAY ONLY
Finely presented is "The Eternal
Temptress," at the Central theater to
day. This is a five-part film in which
Lina Cavalier! makes her Paramount
debut, and which is released on De
cember 3. The famous singer is a
mast acceptable scrtisn subject the
close-up contains for her nothing to in
spire fear. She "photographs" re
makrably well, too. As the production
leaves the hand of Director Einile
ChautaH it is a good subject, the lead
ing player has a role which she wills
to marked advantage, there is a strong
supporting cast, and there is a steady
interest.

Hail the Marines
Out of the murk and gleam that shroud
the desperate defense of Picary and Flan
ders by the Allies are coming many epic
tales of heroism that will live as long in
song and story as Roland's defense of the
pass at Roncesvalles or the charge of the
Old Guard at Waterloo. English, French,
Scotch, Irish and Canadian heroes there
have been a plenty, and now comes the
American into his own. The marines, First
to Fight, have won undying glory in the
great battle of the Somme. Out of one
unit of 250 of these fighters, 161 were
either killed or wounded in defense of their
positions. Losses of sixty per cent! And
still they fought on. America has her tra
ditions. The minute men at Lexington.
The storming of the heights of Saratoga.
Marion's men. Jackson's hunters at New
Orleans. Gen. Taylor's little army at Buena
Vista. The heroes of the Alamo. Prick
ett's" charge at Gettysburg. The indomit
able courage of the Union troops at Cold
Harbor. Custer's last fight on the Little
Big Horn. All these are examples of Amer
ican heroism that we fondly believe rank
with any of the older traditions of the old
world. And now our newer civilization
has entered the arena of France, the most
glorious in all the world, and there, in com
petition with the bravest and the best, has
won laurels that .will never fade. Hail the
marines! First to fight and first to die.
Hail the engineers who fought with Cary
and who are dead nbw.'but whose deeds
will never die. How fine it 13 to do a great
work greatly and fail' not.' "These men we
have sent to France ! They are worthy of
Marion and Jackson and Custer. Steel rods
in the concrete foundations of the repub
lic. Without such deeds and deaths every
generation no nation can endure in the
world in greatness and in peace.
' Beef went up from five to six cents
on the pound in Kansas City this week
with startling suddenness. Now Kansas
City is, next to Chicago, the western cen
tre of the packing industry. Beef is hauled
in trucks within a few minutes from pack
ing house to retail and wholesale butcher.
So, when the prices jump in Kansas City
they-may be expected to soar elsewhere.
Increase in the price for cattle on the hoof
is given as the main cause. If this is really
true, then the consumer can meet the blow
with better courage and fortitude.
Karl Bleistreu, a German military
writer, declares in the Neueuropa that the
German losses on the west front between
August, 1914, and August, 1917, totalled
2,604,961 in killed and prisoners. On the
east front he said the total killed and pris
oners were 1 ,484,550. German writers es
timate the German losses between August.
1917, and January 31, 1918, as 367,450
killed and taken prisoner on "both fronts."
The figures in the Paris dispatch total 4,
456,96 1 German dead and prisoners.
After the fullest discussion the allies
have agreed to give Gen. Foch absolute
power on the western front, "which will
not be influenced by any external pres
sure." Good! This column, as it has stated
often before, pin3 its colors to Gen. Foch.
Just as sure as the sun shines and the river3
run and the grass grows and the winds blow
and the tides of sea flow against the
beaches, will Gen. Foch beat the Hun.
If the Germans insist upon sinking hos
pital ships, the situation might be mended
by putting about twenty German officers
on each vessel, with the understanding that
if a submarine attacks the vessel, they shall
be the last to leave.
Austro-Hur.garian troops are now re
ported in Belgium, which is in keeping with
Austria's desire for peace, and which nlso
again indicates the complete subservience of
Austria to rule from Berlin.
Liberty Day wes a proud day in the
Warren district. Over the top we went with
bands playing and flags flying. Our bond
quota is complete; yea, apd there are thou
sands to spare. It was not a day spent in
spurring men on to do; rather, it was a day
spent in celebrating what had been done.
Cochise county went to the front again,
just as she did in the last loan. Our com
munity may not lead the country with its
honor flag, but we charged across the No
Man's Land with the leaders. No laggards
we. Up and at 'em with the vanguard.
Dark news from France. The German
flood still flows westward. But we are not
dismayed. The American flood is gather
ing head to meet the worst that Germany
can send. Let the Cochise boys in the army
take heart. Their home county is behind
them all the way.
Did you hear that band? The slide
trombone notes echoed to the mountain
tops. Did you see those flags? They
streamed in glory under the bright, brave
sunlight. Did you see those boys and girls,
so young and fair and fine, as they marched
along-? We do and dare and deny for
them. '
Nothing counted but the winning or the
war in the Warren district yesterday. In
all humbleness we are very proud of that
day and its doings and the spirit that is
abroad in the land.
WHEN THE FIFTH ARMY FAILED
Kansas City Star: In the fighting in
the north for the last two weeks the Ger
mans have been unable to make anything
like the gains that were made in the early
days of the offensive. They have bitten in
five, six, seven miles. But there has been
no such sweep as the one that carried them
the thirty-five miles from St. Quentin to
Montdidier in the last days of March. Mili
tary men had figured in advance on a pos
sible gain of five miles by a concentrated
attack. A 35-mile gain was never dreamed
of.
It was because of the unexpected char
acter of the gain that the situation was so
disturbing in the first week of the offen
sive. AH standards of judgment seemed
overthrown. People could not avoid ask
ing themselves where the drive would stop.
Of course the censorship has hidden the
details of what happened in those days df
retreat. But information that has gradu
ally leaked out has indicated that the un
usual German success may have been due
not so much to enemy strength as to weak
ness in the handling of one sector of the de
fense that occupied by the Fifth Army
under General Gough.
The first news that reached this coun
try of any trouble of that sort came in
Lloyd George's speech in the House of-.
Commons, in which he explained the situ
ation on the western front. He then an
nounced that Gough had been relieved.
While it would be unfair to censure the gen
eral in advance of an inquiry, he said, it
would also have been unfair to retain him
in his command.
Since that time Gough's friends have
come to his defense, with assertions that the
fault was not his, but higher up, as he did
not have sufficient troops to guard the sec
tor assigned him. A recent cable to the
New York Times records a conversation
with the French general who apparently
superseded Gough on the third day of the
offensive. The French general remarks
that the Fifth Army had had "bad luck." It
had been "taken. unawares" and was "in
danger of losing cohesion." He cannot
praise too highly, he says, the devotion with
which the British corps commanders exe
cuted his orders, and the magnificent man
ner, in which the men held out.
In plain language, the Fifth Army was
surprised and pretty nearly routed, and a
new commander had to be rushed in with
supporting troops.
It is a fair inference that the bad man
agement of this army was responsible for
the gap that enabled the Germans to make
a drive of thirty-five miles instead of five
miles. Such instances have occurred in
every army and in every war. The Ger
mans had their General Gough at the Battle
of the Marne in Vcn Kluck.
If the inference is correct it cerries jat-
isfaction. It is much more consoling to
think of the extent of the German drive a's
due to the accident of the defense than to
think it measures the superiority of the Ger
man offensive over anything the Allies
could bring into the field against it.
CLEVER COMEDY DRAMA
OFFERING BY ALUMNI
THESPIANS ON MONDAY
The R. II. S. Alumni play, "Young
Mrs. Winthrcp," which tho associa
tion will present at the High Srhool
auditorium Monday ni-ht, is nearly
ready for production. The rehearsal
Thursday night was a complete suc
cess and went off without "a" hitch.
The cast are doing their very best and
the show promises to be worth while
seeling.
The play is one dealing with a
social problem that confronts so many
families in this age and the solution
may be of assistance to some who
have already been blighted by the di
vorce evil. Mr. Snider is directing
the play and expresses himself as
pleased with the progress made.'
The Alumni association expects to
realize a considerable sum for their
loan fund from "Young Mrs. Win
thrcp'' with which to keep In Normal
srhool and universities the members
whom they have sent to gain a hlgker
education.
HER FIGHING CHANCE
EAGLE PICTURE TODAY
"Some day you may go after my
niurderar anil when you do, Francois
Creault will go with you."
A short time after Breault makes
this statement to Corporal Blake of
the Koyal Northwest Mounted Police,
in James Curwood's gripping story
' Her Fighting Chance," Breault'a pre
diction conies true and Blake finds
himself on tha trail of the murderer,
while Bi-Tuult's ghost accompanies him
on the long Journey over the snow
wastes which lead to the cabin of the
murder-suspect and his beautiful girl
wife. lilake finds the little woman
alone and, falling desperately in love
with her, places her in the most diffi
cult position that a true and loving
fe can occupy. To spurn Blake
love is to deliver her husband to tho
hangman io accept his advances is
more than she can force herself to do.
She has but one chance a righting
chance! and the nobl'9 manner In
which she makes her fight, while her
husband'-s "huskies" bring him nearer
and nearer to the snow covered cabin
whei-a his wife and his enemy are
matching their wits, furnishes the in
tensely dramatic moments' leading up
to the powerful climax, in which Jaarf
Gray, as the wife, rises to the mag
nificent heights of strong emotional
acting for which she is justly famous.
FRENCH BEAT BACK
SEVEN HUN ATTACKS
(Continued from Page One)
large groups of Germans, putting many
of them out of action. Eventually they
returned safely to the French line.
Sergeant Mouren, commanding an
other tank, noticing a German field
battery retreating, followed it to at
tack .the gunners. He was 500 yards
within the German lines when his
motor refused to work. The sergeant
dismounted wffii Jiis . crew under a
hurricane of rifle fire and detached
the machine guns with which he re
pulsed a large force of Germans who
attempted to approach, firing until the
last reel of cartridges was spent. The
entire crew, except the sergeant, was
wounded, but the sereeent gathered
the Injured men and they made their
way hrough thickets to the French
position.
Both tank commanders received the
cross of the Legion of Honor on the
battler ield.
Would Separate Armies
A general idea of this resumed Ger
man offensive demonstrates that the
enemy plan was to thrust at the junc
tion of the French and British armies
protecting Amiens with an Intention
of separating them. During the course
of Tuesday night the Germans opened
an artillery preparation of extreme
intensity, having taken advantage of
the respite in the fighting to bring
forward many guns. At dawn on
Wednesday morning the British start
ed a counter bombardment. Shortly
afterward the Germany infantry un
cussessfully attacked the line north
of Villers-Brettonneux. At the same
time the French poured a barrage fire
on the Germans advancing toward
Hangard-Kn-Santerre. The fiercest
fighting ensued throughout "Wednes
day and Wednesday night and as a
result the enemy captured Villers
Brctoiineux, except a few houses in
the outskirts. The enemy then got
within 500 yards of the eastern limits
of Cachy and occupied Haugard wood,
while in Hangard itself they gained
the cemetery and even surrounded the
villaga but the French would not give
up.
Germans Hold Hangard
Simultaneously 'the Germaus made
some progress toward Hailes. During
Wednesday night the British firmly
held their positions immediately
around Viilers-Bretonncux and regain-
led some ground. Large German fore
ies were thrown against Hangard and
the village changed hands on several
I occasions, finally remaining in the pos
session of the Germans this morning.
The hold of the French on Han
gard had becorfie extremely difficult
after the fall of Villers-i:retonneaux,
but they maintained their desperate
defense for a long time in hope that
tho latter village would be recaptured.
Such si the actual position as this dis
patch is written.

REFUSE TO HEAR STEFFENS

SAN DIEGO, Calif., April 26. Lin
coln Steffens, magazine writer and lec
turer, was prevented by the police
tonight from delivering an advertised
address at a local church on the "Men

John Sanders, admitted to the bar
in Arizona last September, and a

iness houses, tried his maiden jury
case in Ton.bstone Tuesday and U eu

menting on the case And its conduct.
Prospector says:
"Sanders was appointed by the
court .to the defense and it was his
first case before a jury. Local at
torneys who watched the case state
that Sanders did remarkably well and
that he did not fail to bring out a
single point in behalf of his indigent
client. His plea to the jury was io
the point and the verdict is evidence
enough of his efforts to make a suc
cess of his work, even though not a
cent of compensation was received."

According to members of the Lib
erty loan committee who went to the
northern part of the county and who
were in the city yesterday, a man
who works in the railroad yards tit
Bowie was arrested Wednesday niht
for making scurrulous remarks about
the Liberty loan and the war, and re
fusing to buy bonds. The man's name
Vas E. Et Cupp. and he caused con
siderable trouble in the yards there,
when his fellow workmen learned of
his refusal and seditious talk and re
fused to go to work with him. His
foreman discharged him following
this, and later the man purchased a
bond, but shortly afterward was ar
rested by the federal authorities from
Tucson, and will be brought before the
federal court. Considerable indigna
tion was stirred up it is said, and
more drastic measures would have
been taken with him by the people
of Bowie had not the federal govern
ment stepped in.

The right of way on the Blsbec

rived for water service. Almost ali
of the culverts are in place and the

now that the purity squad from Dous

unreasonable interference with the
road work, because within a few days
there will probably be 25 bootleggers
playing the part of "lounge lizzards"
In the county jail when they might
be earning their keep instead of a
"dead expense." Bootlegging goes
merrily on in Douglas, according to i-e
ports, and the purity squad may now
be able to explain the reason for it.

Get Dr. Edwards' Olive Tablets
That is the foyful cry of thousands
since Dr. Edwards produced Olive Tablets,
the substitute for calomel.
Dr. Edwards, a practicing physician for
17 years and calomel's old-time enemy,
discovered the formula for Olive Tablets
while treating patients for chronic con
Etipation and torpid livers. 1
Dr. Edwards' Olive Tablets do not
contain calomel, but a healing, soothing
vegetable laxative. :
