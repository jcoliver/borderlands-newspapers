board of the United States Steel cor
poration declared today after the

however, Mr. Gary said, and the cor

even at the risk of some sacrifice,"
Mr. Gary stated.
The steel strike has been ended for
a long time as far as the steel cor

"We are now operating at a rate
of slightly better than 80 per cent of

of local rates did not coincile with

wealthy Newport, R. I., culbman.
Hammond's friends deported him to

went to Boston, where he stole $15.
000 worth of bonds, pleaded guilty in

RELAY RAGE IS

The relay race between the Y. M.

which was to have run against Doug

cause the team lacked more than ' 25

The Gray Wall
"Sh! I hear something," said Nancy.
; "So do I," said Nick. They were inside a little tunnel
they had discovered in the garden. They had asked the kind
green shoes to make them very small, and had borrowed Fan
ny and Frankie Fire-fly for lights, and guided by the magical
mushroom in Nancy's pocket, they had started forth on an
adventure. .
Besides! Who knew but what they might find Jocko, their
lost toy monkey in the tunnel.
Suddenly the sound stopped and everything was just as
quiet as quiet as church on Sunday.
That was strange 1 But it gave the twins more courage,
so they tip-toed softly, tippity-slip-along, oh, so very quiet!
There wasn't a sound.
Suddenly they came to a wall. It was different from the
sides of the tunnel, I can't just tell you how, but it was dif
ferent. It was soft and gray and warm.
"Now, what" said Nick.
"Well," said Nancy, looking around, "let's sit down and
rest, I'm tired." But when they put their fire-flies down, their
JJerhts went out, unless they turned them on their backs and
they didn't like that.
"We'll have to hang them up on a peg," said Nick. Which
the flies agreed to.
But what should they do for a peg?
"Oh, I have it!" cried Nancy. "Here's a pin, Nick. "We
can hammer it in like a nail. This end wall seems softest, so
vou taJ J a stone and pound."
Sfe Nick took the pin and a stone and found a nice place

The committee prefaced its recom

impaired credit of the roads threaten
ed to "break, down" the entire fabric
of transportation and endanger the
business of the land.
The preface added:
"The present high cost of living
would be driven higher."
Must Build Credit
The committee believed that the
people and congress would welcome
its opinion "as to what is necessary to
rehabilitate credit of the railroads,"
and made the following suggestions:
"Return the roads tt private own
ership as soon as practicable.
"Permit, but do not compel, . con
solidation of railroad properties under
the approval of the Interstate Com
merce commission or such other board
as congress may establish.
"Permit federal incorporation. ,
"The Interstate Commerce commis

'exclusive regulation and control of
issues of stocks and bonds by rail
roads and water common carriers, and
of the purposes to which the sale of
such securities may be applies.'
Guarantee Income ,
"A government guarantee 'for six
months after the end of federal con
trol, of net operating Income equal to
the standard return for the same pe
riod under government control.
"Extension for from 10 to 20 years
of the companies' indebtedness to the
government for capital expenses, such
extensions to run serially.
"A statutory rule for the regulation
by the Interstate Commerce commis
sion of all interstate rates, maximum,
minium and joint, 'provided that the
railway carriers, as a whole, shall be
allowed to earn an aggregate mini

fessor Hobbs said:
"Standing in the presence of the as

ference at the formal presentation of
the covenant of the league of nations,
Woodrow Wilson declared of this in
strument: 'It is definite as a guaran
tee of peace. It is definite as a guar
antee against aggression.'
Wood Foresees War
"On the other hand, Oan. Leonard
Wood has made the statement that
the claim that any covenant will pro
tect the world from future wars is idle
twaddle and a dream of mollycoddles.
The pacifists, moreover, tell you lies
when they say wa? aa an institution
is dead. Don't listen to the molly
coddles. Be a citizen of common
sense. '.
"Which guide are we to follow?
Each has been a leader in the recent
past when the issue was, as now, both
national security and world idealism.

not become involved in the war and
that the affairs of Europe were not
our concern, so he advocated non-preparedness

Wood declared that we were Very
likely to become involved in the war,
that our only safety was in making
preparations lor any contingency, that
the world struggle was our war, and
he risked all that he had to save the
country and his country's honor.
"The pacifists' solution did not then
avail to keep us out of war, despite
Mr. Wilson's consoling promises, and
the internationalists' solution which
he now no less confidently offers to
charm away future wars has an equal
chance of success.
Roosevelt's Advice
"Theodore Roosevelt tells us: 'It is
well at this time for sober and reso
lute men and women to apply that
excellent variety of wisdom colloquial
ly known as "horse sense" to the
problems of nationalism and interna
tionalism.' ' 'Nations are made, defended and
preserved, not by the illusionists, but ,
by the men and women who practice'
the homely virtues in time of peace,
and who, in time of righteous war, are
ready to die, or send those they love
best to die, for a shining ideal.' "

WITH this issue of the Review terminates the tenure of the
present management of this paper, under which its affairs
have been administered during the past year.
Beginning tomorrow, the first day of the new year, Mr.
B. P. Guild, who has been at the head of the Review administration
as general manager since last January, will assume charge of the
Arizona Daily Star in Tucson, in a similar capacity. Mr. Lawrence
D. Clark, general manager of the Star since March, 1918, comes to
the Retiew as generalTiiianager beginning with tomorrow's issue.
In bidding good-bye to Bisbee and the Warren District, the pres
ent general manager wishes to thank the readers of the Review, and
all advertising and other patrons, for the spirit of co-operation and
interest they have shown throughout his administration. He feels
that the year has been one characterized by a display of mutual good
will which has been an invaluable aid toward the building up of this
paper, and trusts that the liberality of patronage extended by the
merchants and residents of the district in general, has been in some
degree reflected in his endeavors to give the district, a daily journal
worthy of its clientele.
To bespeak for Mr. Clark, the incoming general manager, a con
tinuance of this patronage and spirit of cooperation and good will,
must be superfluous here, for Mr. Clark, is well-known throughout the
Warren District, having served the Review as editor lor several
years prior to his departure 10 Tucson. The return of Mr. Clark
will be welcomed by a wide circle of warm personal friends, and to
wish the Review's prosperous and popular new year under his ad
ministration, is to wish what may be regarded as predestined to
occur.
So in taking leave or his own and the Review's friends and
patrons throughout the Warren District, the present general man
ager's parting message is one of appreciation for the friendship or
the people of the district which has made his administration such a
pleasant one, and to wish them each and all a full measure, pressed
down and running over, of personal happiness and business success
in the new year 1920.
FIXING THE s BLAME
AMONG the awaiting deportation at Ellis Island has undesirable
aliens is a seventeen-year-old boy. He was brought to this
public schools, learned to read and is reported as haunting the
country at the age of ten years, was put at once into American
libraries, says the Mesa Tribune. Where did he learn the Red doc
trines which he avows, and which at such an early age he practices
so consistently, that he must be banished from the country?
Did he learn his evil doctrine in the schools? In the library?
Not entirely in either. He listened to the street harangues of Morris
Hillquit. the pernicious teachings of Emma Goldman, and acknowl
edges these leaders as his guiding stars.
The trouble was not alone with the school nor the library. But
part of the trouble lay there. The school did not take pains enough
to direct this quick, awakening mind, to direct its attention to the
beauties and the possibilities offered by American life. It taught a
little desolutory, cut-and-dried patriotism, but failed to urouse the
thrill of loyalty which the beauty. and the freedom of this country
can easily arouse if properly presented and enthusiastically fostered.
It might be unwise to close the libraries to the writings of an
archists or any who deal with differing forms of government, but
there should be sufficient supervision of the reading of the young
so that somebody knows which way they are tending. Every '.ibrary
should be a center for the teaching of law and order. Such teach
ings should be left to no haphazard chance, but should be part of a
carefully planned system of Americanization.
The stigma is not upon thie eager, arrogant, misguided boy. It
is not entirely upon any great public institution. It is upon the
faulty system which, saving young destiny in its hands, shirks re
sponsibility and allows its to run wild.

pamphlet speak.
"Situated," it says, "south of the Caucasus, on the Caspian Sea, at the
mouths of the Kura and Rrax, Azerbaidjan was on the way of the great
migrations of barbarians, toward Europe. Later some Turkish tibes settled
there. Any traveler can immediately recognize in the Azerbaidjani ins
quite a different type of people from the Armenians and the Georgians, their
western neighbors, and from the Persians, who- still occupy a large tract or
Azerbaidjan. The Azerbaidjanian type differs also from those of the Cau
casian mountain tribes, Circassians (Adiges-J, Ossetians, Tehetchenians, In
gouph, etc.

FROM SUN TO SUN THE ONCE OVER
Bill Sherrill, on traffic duty to route automobiles up the Subway dur
ing the paving of Main street, was heard to say to a bewildered motorist in
tones of deepest disgust the other day:
"Say, if you were driving a car on the Sahara desert you'd run kito a

Which is some driving, we'll all agree with Bill.

A PROMISING OUTLOOK. "
"I seed the start ol what looked like it was going to be a right lively
fuss, over at Tumlinville yesterday." related Gap Johnson of Rumpus Ridge.
Ark. "A couple of fellows jumped onto another feller, for something or
nuther, I reckon, although I didn't learn what, and went to 'mauling him right
sharply. Then another feller jumpad In, to make it evn. About that time
the sheriff came arunning and staffed to pull 'em apart, and all four lit in
on him. He deputized a passe of fellers that were standing around, and
they sorter took hold, and another bunch of fellers that came up 'peared to
figger that the process was too one-sided, and so they tore in. too. About
that time it began to rain, and they all adjourned to the porch of the Tote
Fair store and went to talking horse swap and 'politics. But for a spell I
shore reckoned I was going to see something of a fight."

ents are showing the same spirit as
hat expressed in one oft heir yells
"We never get beat, hurrah! Hurrah!"
The boys who worked clearing
away the debris from the high school
during the Christmas vacation will
get their checks at the Central school
office Saturday, January 3.
The students expressed a ; dislike
for the building as everyone had
learned to love the old high school, j
The students felt as a stranger feels
in another's home. The members ot
the chemistry, physics and biology
classes did the most complaining, as
the science laboratory equipment of
the Horace Mann is not adequate for
a high school class.
THE New Year will be ushered in with a "prayer around the
world." It will be spoken in every language human beings pray
in, in every country, by all colors.
The Watch Night Prayer was written at the suggestion ot
the Inteichurch World Movement of North America, and has been
translated and sent all over the world so that it may be heard in
the old world and the new, wherever Christians meet to greet the
coming of another year.
This is the prayer:
Almighty God, Father of all mankind, at the end of a year in
which malice has so often thwarted love, we join the prayers of all
Thy children around the world tor peace, the elevation of justice
and brotherhood.
Thou Creator, possessor of all things, who didst make .the earth
for the races of men and didst set bounds for their habitation, for
give us our greed as we repent of our sin, and restore to all hearts
the recognition of the transcendant right of human life to live.
Open our eyes, we beseech Thee, to the dignity of labor, the
sacredness or human service, and the privileges of production, that
nation may join nation and man may join man justly in honest work
to replenish a devastated earth.
Quicken the sympathy of hearts made dull by reports and sights
of suffering incomprehensible and needless.
Call us again, that we may bow before the eternal laws ot crea
tion, putting aside malice, envy, convetousness and brutality, to en
ter into peace of the sons of the Most High.
Hasten by Thy gracious providence and by consecrated eiforts
of Thy children the coming of Thy world-wide kingdom where justice,
mercy and love shall rule the hearts and hands of men.
Create in us, O Iord, clean hearts, and renew right spirits tor
the coming year.
This we ask in the spirit, of Jesus Christ, our only Hcpe. Amen!

Lloyd George's rctusal to deal with the Keds of Russia until they
convene a national assembly is something in the nature of a notice,
that autocracy must come to an end in Russia. Just at. present that
is the only sort of government, they have in Russia. The Czar's rov
ernmcnt was an autocratic affair, but it was a milk and water sort
of autocracy, compared with that established by Trotzky and Leninc.
Coach Ed. J. Lawrenson has an
nounced that the boy's and girls' bas
ketball teams would be reorganized.
The boys' team will start practicising
Wednesday morning in the Y. M. C.
A. gymnasium at 10:00 o'clock, and
the girls' team will begin practice on
Thursday morning at the same hour.
Though the teams are beginning their
practice so late in the season, they
expect to win from every hish school
in this part of the state. The stud-
Earl V. Thompson has announced
that Bisbee has cancelled the Douglas
to Bisbee relay race, thereby forfeit
ing it. The reason for cancelling the
race was that not enough of the older
boys ' signed up. The race required
115 boys aid only 70 signed up to
run.
The students of Douglas high
school will try to retrieve the prest
ige they lost on the football field by
defeating Bisbee on the track. Doug
las has some very good track ma
terial but the Bisbee boys are not
figuring on letting her carry away
the honors without a Struggle. Pro
fessor Welemeyer of the Douglas high
school is trying to arrange a track
meet With Bisbee for the coming
spring. Coach Lawrenson favors
such a meet and thinks that it would
be good training for the annual ath
letic week which is held annually at
Tucson.

Regardless of the yeung man's fears of Leap Year, have you 'seen the
winged white mule? Somebody reported him flying over Lowell Satur
day night but he kept on flying. Rumors are thai; he flew qp pn Quality Hill
and lighted there. A black cat on the fence meowed in. mournful melody
for the mule wno seemed to have known the smaller creature before. The
cat's mournful melody touched the mule's musical cords and there was re
leased long.notes of neighing. The mule wasn't the only thing or creature
that was Hying Saturday night for before cat and niule had come to the
chorus of their song a flying shoe routed the cat and routed the mule. But
the shoe was not Mercury's. It came from the direction of Judge Allison's
house, and, we'll say, was all to the decisive.
o
Father Time told us, confidentially, that he has an enormous list of
women who slipped up last Leap Year, and a few who let 1912 get by them.
He didn't admit it. but we bet there are some who at one time looked for
ward to 1908 with their man marked for attack, failed to leap and subse
quently have banked on 1912, 1916 and now are mobilizing all their wits and
resources for the 1920 advance. .
o
Of course, if the woman has so many resources, material and otherwise,
that she has to mobilize them well, that's different.
But, as the feller who writes this sturf romaTked. "If you think this
stuff is funny you're the joke."

We just received a report over our own " greased wire from Tintown
telling us the distriet is full of girls waiting for Leap Year. And the report
adds that they won't have tp change their methods much.

..NEW YEAR'S IN OTHER LANDS..
The first day of the year has been
a time for celebration since the days
of the great Roman empire. The Ro
mans exchanged greetings and made
presents to such an extent that, under
the Caesars, New Year's was a very
profitable day to the emperor and a
burden to his subjects.
In the Persian calendar the year be
gins on March 21, which day is one of
rejoicing. Among other peoples, the
year began on March 25, until 1752,
when Great Britain changed it to Jan.
1, by an act of parliament.
Old. Saxon Test
.The rejoicing and Kood fellowship
at New Year's among the Teutonic
and Saxon people called for a "flow
ing bowl," in their belief ultimately
this was the origin of (he wassail
bowl, so-called because of the usual
toast, "To your health." or "wasshail"
in Saxon. The bowl was so large that
a man had to use both hands to raise
it to his lips when he drank from it.
Times were so strenuous .1 hen that a
friend always stood by with drawn

haps Japan has the most unusual.
There it is a day of much festivity.
Every doorway is symbolically decor
ated, the usual form being a green
arch. This arch is made of two small
pine trees, bamboos and a grass rope.
A small pine tree with a reddish stem
is placed at the right of the doorway,
one with a black stein at. the left.
Close to the pines on eifher side are
set light stems of bamboo, while the
distance between the. pines, usually
aboilt six feet, is spanned by a grass
rope, raised just high enough to allow
of passage beneath it.
Bamboo For H-le Life
The pine trees symbolize to the
Japanese a stalwart age which has
withstood all hardships of struggle.
Feminine characteristics are attribut
ed to the pine with the reddish jtem,
and masculine to the dark. The Dam

of rings, symbolize fullness of years,

BY REVIEW
STOCKS AND BONDS
NEW YORK, Dec. 30. High money
rates imposed further restraints on
the stock market during the early and
middle stages of, today's session, but
this was more than offset lated by
encouraging industrial prospects.
Call loans opened at 15 per cent,
the highest renewal rate of the year,
and rose to 25 per cent later, closing
at that quotation. There was further
eager bidding for time money at 8 to
8 per cent, but little was forthcom
ing. Among bankers there was much
'.speculation respecting the outcome of
I the conference called by the federal
reserve board for the early part of
January, when the question of dis
count and interest rates is to come up
for earnest discussion. The day's
favorable developments included an
other advance In the price of copper
and reports of additional heavy book
ings by steel producers.
Steels, equipments, motors and, oils
also participated in, the vigorous rally
of the last hour with metals, ship
pings, leahers and several of the
rails, although the latter as a class
made' comparatively little headway. .
Sales amounted to 1,350,000 shares. I
Trading in bonds was vz. the light 1
est scale almost of any day of the
year, but the trend was lower, espe
cially among rails and industrials. To-
tal sales, par value, were 538,450,000.
Uld United States bonds were un-;
changed on call.
COTTON MARKET
NEW YORK, Dec. 30. Cotton
closed steady at a net advance of IS
to 42 points.

MOIST T I INT S
BIG ASSET IN
That the southwest is enjoying the
service of large concerns other than
mining is best evidenced in the busi
ness and equipment of the E. A.
Tovrea company.
According to facts and figure the
Tovrea company's parking plant iu
Tovreaville is the largest and most
sanitary establishment in the south
west. During November alone this
company slaughtered 431,250 pounds
of beef, 45.000 pounds of hog and 11,
250 pounds of mutton. A United
States . government inspector is sta
tioned at the plant and every animal
is examined before being slaughtered.
After the meat is dressed It again
has to pass government inspection
and only that meat found to be clean
and healthy is allowed to be put on
the market.
'"Great care should be taken in
purchasing meat," says Mr. E. A.
Tovrea, " but meat that carries the
government stamp is free from any
disease. The government stamp is
the consumer's protection."
Bisbee, Lowell, Warren, Douglas,
Nogales, Deming, New Mexico, ana
the soldiers along the border are sup
plied with meat by the Tovrea com
pany. .
Speaking of his business, which
has grown so steadily in the past few
years. Mr. Tovrea says:
"The price of meats has not gone
up in proportion to other foods ana
people should not deny themselves
the food, especially beef, which is the
cheapest of food articles and the
most nutritious.
"Our company employs 98 woikers
and pays out $20,000 a month in
wages. We invite charge accounts
and have found that strict auditing
eliminates most of the loss that goes
with the credit business."
Besides meats the Tovrea company
carries butter, eggs, cheese, poultry,
fish, oysters, pickleB, olives and
kraut.

MINE SYSTEMS
An unusual attendance of the
classes of the practical mining course,
being given by tho Phelps .Dodge cor
poration and under the direction or
C. S. Dickinson, was on hand yester
day both at the afternoon and night
meetings.
Mr. Gerald Sherman, consulting en
gineer of the Copper Queen, address
ed the miner-students on "The Selec
tion of a Mining Method." He ex
plained that surface work Is usually
chenpe-r by the ton thnn underground
and that it may cost less to handle a
much larger combined tonnage of
waste and ore from the surface than
the ore alone from below. .
' "Ore may be mined from the sur
face by several methods: by quarry
in.tr, by milling down through raises
or by steam shovel," he said. "The
conditions which affect the selection
of a method of underground mining
in their older of importance are, first,
the size of the ore body, second, the
value of the ore, and third, the na
ture of the ore and surrounding
rock."
Explaining in detail the various
methods of mining, Mr. Sherman, in
cluded in his lecture the subjects of
ore value, ore deposits with weak orj
strons walls, irregular deposits, flat
vein of bed.s, steep veins, sinking of ;
the surface, sub-level caving ana
block caving.
