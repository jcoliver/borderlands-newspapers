Senator Simmons hopes to intro

the Democrats on the committee. On
the basis of the proposed measure,
thus far, income, excess profits, li
quor, tobacco, special excise or con
sumption and stamp taxes, are the
principal revenue sources. The com

LONDON, May 30 FROM A STAFF
CORRESPONDENT OF THE ASSO
CIATED PRESS. The recent lull in
the fighting has had no effect what
ever upon the British aerial offensive
which continues day and night. The
last few days there have been wit
nessed some of the most desperate air
battles of the entire war. One or
two of these have been fought at the
unprecedented height of 19.000 feet,
or more than three and one half miles
from the earth.
Recently there was duel in which a
British pilot having run out of am
munition, got close enough to his an
tagonist to shoot him down with his
revolver. The incident served to re
call the fact that when the war began
the only weapons which aerial pilots
had were pstols and carbines.
Commenting today upon the dazzl
ing altitudes at which many combats
occur nowadays, a pilot said that when
he first went to war in 1914 he flew
a machine which took an hour and a
quarter to reach 6.000 feet.
"That's nothing," said one of his
comrades. "The old bus I had in those
days couldn't reach 6.000 feet at all."

Liberty Loan Facts
WHY DOES THE GOVERNMENT
SELL BONDS?
The sinews of war are men. munitions and money. The greatest
immediate need of the I'nited States today, to render the best help
to her Allies, is money.
This money can be raised by the government by borrowing and
by taxing. The I'nited States is at present employing both methods.
Borrowing by means of the Liberty Bonds is a method of securing Im
mediate funds for the prosecution of the war and spreading the burden
of repayment over a period of from 15 to 30 years.' when, it is hoped,
world civilization will be in a happier state than now. Taxation does

It is this government's avowed intention to put the burden of our
Fare in this struggle for democracy as far as possible on the present
generation and not to shift our troubles on to our children. That is
why the Liberty Bonds are issued with a maturity of only 30 years
and a large part of the current expenses will be taken care of by
taxation.
This is sound reasoning, as we can well stand the burden. It will
keep our country in healthy financial condition for the keen world
competition in business which we must face after the war.

OLE OLSON, BISBEE
RESIDENT OF YEARS,
SUCCUMBSIN TUCSON
Popular Local Man Died In
Hospital In Old Pueblo Aft
er Long Illness. No Funeral
Arrangements Announced.
Maintaining a hp'je for the future
and a brightness of character wbjch
made him beloved by all of his friends
in the Warren lUstrict to the very end.
the last spark of Einar (Ole) Olson
dimmed and set yesterday morning.
The end came at St. Mary's hospital.
Tucl-011, where the Lisbee man has
been for some months in hope of re
covery. Tuberculosis was the cause
of death.
Ole Oison came to Bisbee over
twelve years aj-V) and immediately be
gan to make friends. He worried' for
the Phelps Dodge Mercantile Company
tor some time and then went with
Schwartz Brothers Company, by which
linn he was employed until his death,
lie improved in health after arriving in
Bisbee but of iate has steadily de
clined. Last yejr he moved to Tucson
in hopes that a lov.er. altitude would
aid him.
While in Eiiibee Ole Olson was
known i'j all. When the community
was smaller, Ole knew everybody. He
was liked by everybody. A sunny dis
position added to his natural ability to
make and keep friends. His death will
bring a sense of loss to his many ac
quaintances here. He was a member
of tae local lodge of Moooe.
Olison is survived by his mother, two
sister.-, and two brothers, all residents
of Chicago, the birthplace of Ole. Two
of the sisters have left Chicago for Tuc
son, where they will take charge of
the body. Though no funeral arrange
ments have been announced, inasmuch
as they pend the decision of ihe rela
tives from the eatt. it is supposed that
he will be buried in Tucson or in Bis
bee. MEXICAN SHOPLIFTER

sciontious 10 fight lie ought to take his
conscience out and look at it, for it is
certainly sick."
The first duty of a man the colonel
added, is to be a "man's man, not just
a sexless creature who ants some
body to fii-ht for him."
He urged those present, as a pat
riotie duty, to subscribe for Liberty
Bonds. "The bonds will be safe unless
I'nele Sam smashes up; and if the
United States smashes up. we will all
be smashed up and it won't make any
difference whether' the bonds will be
good or bad."
The people, he declared, "can pre
vent Wall Street from financing Ck
government." if they themselves wMl
finance the government
"Kvery man and every woman who
complains because Wall Street fin
ances the government." -he continued,
"and tlifn doesn't do his or her share
to finaueo has no riuht to snarl a;
Wall Street for doing more and wri
more patriotic than you yourselves
have been.
"I want to say to you men of
wealth," continued the colonel, "thrt
this is a bad summer to hire man to
do some useless thing, so don't hire
men to move trees around or to ruild
brick walls that look as if they were
meant for an asylum."

"The Traveling Salesman,"
With Famous Star In Lead

Start To Finish.
If there'is one season of the year in
which the most inveterate traveler
likes to be at home it is during Christ
mas. The poor traveling salesman sel
dom has the good fortune to so arrange
his schedule that be reaches home for
that festive occasion, but he genermly
tries to console himself with . . ':.,;
the best town on his route. Iiuagine
the disgust with which Bob Blake,
traveling man, idscovered that a care
less porter had permitted him to over
I sleep on Christmas n.'jrning and that
he was miles b?yond his station!
Blake was forced to alight at Grar.d
I Crossing a real "hick" town and
;was preparing to die of boredom, when
things began to happen so fast that he
still remembers that as the greatest
Christmas of his life!
It all happened in the Famous Play
ers adaptation of Frank Mclutyre's
greatest stage success, "The Traveling
Salesman," in which the celebrated
comedian makes h'3 motion picture de
but. It is the Parau.'jun tPicture at the

BIG DOUBLE BILL
AT CENTRAL TODAY
Francis X. Bushman, Beverly Eayne
and Mme. Petrova will be the stars ap
pearing at the Central theater tonight
on a big double bill. Mme. Tetrova
will be shown in the famous Metro
wonderplay, "Burned Bridges." This
film portrays scenes on European bat
tlefields in a manner that makes one
shiver with apprehension. Thi'juph
out the film there runs one of the
sweetest love stories ever depicted on
the screen. Mme. Petrova has not ap
peared in any better picture in many
months than "Burned Bridges."
Bushman and Payne will be shown
in the thirteenth episode of the popu
lar serial. "The Oreat Secret." These
two ftars need no introduction to
movci pjvers of the Warren Iistrict. It
is enough to say that the thirteenth
episode is one of the most interesting
of "The Great Secret."

Following.
CINCINNATI, May 30. Louis Chev
rolet, traveling at an average rat1? of
more than 102 miles an hour, captured
the 250-miie Indianapolis sweepstakes
at the Sharonville track today, Gaston
Chevrolet, his brother, running second.
Ira Vaill was less than a sixteenth of
a mile behind the second man. The re
mainder were well strung out.
For just a moment while the racers
were on their 2:lHth mile it appeared
as though Gaston Chevrolet would tar
ry off the prize, but tire trouble al the
last moment forced him into the pit.
and he had to capitulate to his broth
er, who had the distinction of going
through the entire race without a stop
at the rits.
Ua'ph De Palma looked like a strong
c'oaitndcr tor more than half the jour
ney. Engine trouble forced him out
alter 150 miles.
Earl Cooper likewise had hard luck
with tire trouble but managed to con
tinue and finish seventh. Tom Milton,
who had been hanging within a mile or
tvo of the leaders during the entire
race, came strong toward the end and
captured fourth position . Otto i!en
ningen was firth and Eddie Hearne
sixth.
The race was remarkably free fi'oni
serious accideets. one car catching fire
on the back stretch but doing little se
rious tlaniu'e outside of destroying the
car. Another machine went into a
fence on tho far turn of the track but
did :io damage.
Engine trouble accounted for several
dropping out.
Barney Oldiield finished eighth in
the race, Ralph Mulford ninth. A. H.
Patterson tenth and JVe Thomas eleventh.
All the theaters in the Warren Dis
trict are going to show slides read
ing, "liny a Liberty Bund and help
your country. Every man in the serv
ice is expected to stand by his gun.
Every man out of the service can help
by buying a Liberty Bond."
Every Diamond Tire must deliver full value in service.
If ever a Diamond Tire fails, a cheerful, willing adjustment
will be prorrptly made.

HITTING UNDER THE BELT.
With a labor 'disturbance, yet 'young, two men have
been shot to death by "unknown persons" at Jerome. In
the Verde Mining District. Near-riots have occurred and
the Industry which has made of the northern Arizona
town a household term, for opportunity, is prostrate.
Personal ambition and a desire, apparently, to cripple
the nation through its internal life, have caused a condi
tion of affairs which seemed impossible in an enlightened
'and patriotic region.
Least ofa!l do the miners and other workingmen of
Arizona approve of the actions of strikers t Jerome.
Labor does not, and never will, approve of bloodshed, re
gardless of its origin. The miners and other working
men of Arizona, moreover, do not, and will not, tolerate
a disruption of excellent working conditions and top
wages by failing to see through the mask of iU perpat
rators. The miner knows when he is receiving good
wages. He knows when he is working under good con
ditions. Jerome is one of the most telling examples, in modern
industrial history, of "men rushing in where angels fear
to tread." The miners in the Verde district asked the
operators for the Miami scale. This was granted but the
demands had, by that time, grown in other directions.
They were refused and the men, or a part of the men,
struck. Wages, apparently, had little to do with the
situation. Conditions which governed in Jerome in nor
mal times have no place, if the strike leaders' actions
ar to be taken as a criterion in the district when the
country is facing the greatest crisis in its history.
Thus, undoubtedly, is the position of the strikers In
Jerome. When tjie country reeds the product of the
camp; when the very life of the nation is contingent upon
the permanency and ecffiiency of the industries of the
country, men demand conditions which they would fear
to, urge In normal times. Surely the average man is not
to be fooled by such actions.
Regretable In the extreme is the murder in Jerome.
It brings stain upon the District where it occurs and
does not aid the cause of labor. The occurences may.
however, bring the attention of the ordinary man more
closely to the situation and sentiment, thereby, will, un
doubtedly, be crystalized to the point where similar
strikes, forJike purposes, will be frowned upon by the
men who usually participate the workingmen.
are free from taxation a highly significant factor, at a
time when heavy war ta'xes are being laid on neariy every
other form of investment. Moreover, according to Jacob!
Schlff, one of the foremost financial authorities In Amer
ica, these bonds are almost sure to rise in value.
If the war is a short one, says Mr. Schiff, the Liberty
Loan Bonds are "absolutely certain to go to a consider
able premium." If the war is long, later bond issues will
bear a higher rate of Interest. Then the present issue
will automatically rise to the same rate', and bear inter
est at 4 per cent, or 4 Ppr cent, or whatever the highest
future rate may be.
So, whether patriotic or business motives are stronger,
it comes to the same thing: Buy Liberty Bonds!
INSURANCE FOR ARMY AND NAVY.
The government has been considering the matter fa"
insuring the lives of all the soldiers, sailors and marines
who enter the big war. They would be insured against
death or disability, precisely as civilians are in ordinary
times. The plans are beng formulated by the Council of
National Defense, with the help of insurance experts.
The government is expected, if this plan matures, o
put the whole proposition up to the private, insurance
companies, the government taking out the policies in be
half of the men, and paying the premiums. If it appears
to be too much for the private companies to handle, or
there is any hitch in the arrangements, the government
itself may undertake, it.
This is said to be the most revolutionary step of the
sort yet taken or contemplated by any government. But
that is no argument against it. In fact. It is hard to ad
duce any good reason why this very policy should not be
adopted. A system of scientific, equitable, demcoratic
insurance for the men who risk their lives in their coun
try's defense would be far better than the unscientific,
hap-hazard pension system that has prevailed thus far.
with all its politi'-al abuses and its big incidental expenm?
to the government and the beneficiaries.
THE CHANNEL TUNNEL.
The British people are taking a lively interest just now
in the oft-discussed plan for a tunnel under the Channel
to France. It Is expected that this great work will be
undertaken before long.
It would have been started long ago, no doubt, had it
not been. for mutual jealousy and fear on the part of
England and France. Both saw clearly enough the ad
vantage of such a safe, quick traffic route from England
to the Continent, but each feared that its very benefits
might be turned into military perils. Great Britain parti
cularly was weary of giving any continental power such
easy access to the "tight little isle." With that tunntl
open and working, it was felt, the isolation that has al
ways been Britain's safety would be gone forever.
Ail such fears appear to have vanished. 'The French
and British no longer distrust each other. And it Is be
lieved that precautions can easily be taken against the
possibility of Germany or any other hostile power ever
utilizing the tunnel for military purposes. Certain sec
tions of It could be flooded In emergency without per
manent damage.
The positive strategic advantages are immense. What
would Great Britain and France not give today if such
a passage were finished and operating, insuring the
prompt transfer o armies and supplies beyond any possi
bility of interference by enemy submarines! In normal
times the commercial benefits would be enormous.
As an engineering problem the plan offers no great!
difficulty. It is vast, but simple nowhere near so hard
an undertaking as the Panama canal. It's merely a matter
of boring two big tubes through 30 miles or so of soi. j
chalk, which is easily cut 'and almost impervious To:
water. The New York subway system was a bigger job.

THE CHURCH AS A BUSINESS. j
That a church should be run like a business was urged
by the Baptist Northern Convention recently. Perhaps '
after enough church boards of all denominations have dis-
cussed this matter frankly, Improvement in present church ,
methods may be expected. I
People have looked upon churches with the single eye
of sentiment too long. They have some vague idea that :
their pastors will be fed like Elija, or can pick up manna
in their back yards. They forget that everything mortal, ;
whether Individual or institution, so long as it exists
upon this earth has not only a soul but a body. To keep
the soul of the church foremost in the mind is the right j
attitude. But the body must not be forgotten. ' j
With an individual, if the body Is well-nourished and
taken care of as a matter of course, the owner's mind and :
soul are free to roam whatever fields they will. Of the
body he Is scarcely conscious at all. But the moment the
body is neglected, it becomes insistent, and the owner
can think of nothing else until its needs are fulfilled.
It's just so with a church. So long as the pastor is '
paid a decent living salary, and paid it promptly as the j
manager of a business would be; so long as repairs and j
upkeep to the edifice are attended to in a prompt and
business-like manner, just so long the church is free to:
exercise its religious and civic functions as the repre- j
sentative of its Founder. But the moment the manage-1
ment becomes slack, stingy, careless, that minute thej
spiritual power begins to wane, to become subservient j
to the material needs. j
The man who belongs to a club pays his dues regularly
and does not begrudge the steward his recompense. The
Fame plan should apply to the religious club which is th
body of the church.
BRAZIL'S AMERICANISM.
i
Brazil knows precisely what she is about. She lias
passed 'calmly from a state of normal neutrality to a
state of war. i
"Brazil declares war on nobody," says Foreign Ministpr,
Pecanha, explaining his government's failure to make a
specific declaration. "Brazil defends herself. It is Ger
many which declares war on all neutrals." Wherefore ,
Brazil, having neither more nor less cause for bellieer-
enry than the l nlted states, enters into tnoroucu unucr-
standing and co-operation with us.
There is no toadying to this country. Brazil simply re-
cognizes us as the most powerful of American republics.
and therefore the natural leader in defending the freedom

That job won't crack
or peel or blister
the paint is there to stay
Use a paint good enough to give you this
assurance. It is true economy. All the time
and care you devote to the interior of your
home are pretty nearly wasted if the first
impression visitors receive is a shabby coat
of paint outside.
SWP
is a paint specialty made for the exterior of houses. It
looks better and lasts longer than other paints. Properly
applied, SWP will give you a handsomc.'weather-tight
coat of paint that will go for years without a sign of crack,
peel or blister. If you make sure thst you get S W P on
your house it will be a long time before you will have
the bother and expense of painting again.
