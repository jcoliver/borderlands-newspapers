Col. House Reserved By the
Senate Probers As a Pinch
Hitter If Wilson Fails to
Satisfy; Publicity Promised
WASHINGTON. Aug. 14 President
Wilson's offer to talk over the peace
treaty with the senate foreign rela
tions committee finally was accepted
today. At the suggestion of Repub
lican members and by a virtually
unanimous vote, the committee decid
ed to inform the president it would
be glad to meet him at his conven
ience to go over disputed poinis in
the treaty and the League of Nations
covenant. At the same time the com
mittee voted to call additional wit
nesses and continue its hearings.
Tonight the president set 10 o'clock
next Tuesday for the meeting and
wrote to Chairman Lodge that in line
with a suggestion by the committee,
he would not consider thoy discus
sion confidential in nature. In noti
fying Mr. WrtSon of the committee
decision Senator Lodge had written
that members did not desire to be
bound by secrecy. .' ' ' -'
To Meet in WhlteHouse. '
The president chose the White
House' as the place of meeting, al
though the chairman had left the way
open for him to come before the com
mittee at the capitol if he preferred.
The letters were not mode public
but Secretary Tumulty issued this
statement:
"The president received. Senator
Lodge's request for an appointment
to ineet the foreign relations commit
tee to discuss the treaty of peace. Of
course the president welcomes mis
opportunity to meet the foreign rela
tions committee and has fixed Tues
day moraine: at 10 a. m. as the time
for a meeting at the White House.
"The unprecedented condition of the
conference as set by Senator Lodge
in his letter to the president fits
in with the president's own prefer
ence as to publicity, bo that the peo
ple of the country may be put in pos
session of all the information he has
about the treaty of peace." ' '
Both Sides Seek Publicity.
Mr. Lodge told the president that it
was assumed by the committee that
nothing said at ' the meeting would
be considered confidential. He re
called that the plan of the senate was
to consider the treaty In open execu-
tive session, and in view of this plan,
the committee felt that any informa
tion in regard to the treaty which
came into their possession should not
be withheld from the public. It was
to this paragraph ; of the letter that
Mr. Tumulty referred in stating the
president's desire for publicity.
It also left the way open for him
to either receive the committee at
the White House or' come before, it
at the capitol, ChalTman Lodge's -let

mlttee members would meet Mr. Wil

Ford Asked For Million; Both Sides Profess Satisfaction
MT. CLEMENS, Aug. if. A jury
tonight awarded Henry Ford", six
cents damages against the Chicago
Tribune for calling him an anarchist.
Orvy Hulett, foreman of the Jury,
said that they took "nine ballots that
I can remember." The first one, ac-
Lcprding . to Leonard Measel, another
juror, srood eight to four in favor of
awarding Mr. Ford some damages.
Attorney Alfreds. Murphy, for Mr.
Ford, said: "
"The important issue in this case
has been determined favorably to the
plaintiff. He has been, vindicated.
Says Ford Didn't Want Coin.
"Money damages were entirely sub
ordinate and were not sought by Mr.
Ford. He stands not only vindicated,
but his attitude as an American cit
izen has been justified after a trial
which raised every issue aeaints him.
which ingenuity and research could
present. His friends are entirely sat
isfied." Weymouth Kirkland, of counsel for
the Tribune,' said:
"We call it a victory for the reason
that "Attorney Alfred Lucking, in
closing for Mr. Ford, stated that any
thing less than substantial damages
would be a defeat for his client."
Verdict is Unexpected. '
The end of the great suit, which
began three months ago, came when
the lawyers and spectators had about
made up their minds that they were
in for a night of waiting and watch
ing, with a mistrial as the probable
outcome. ;
The Jury had been out ten hours
when a resounding double knock was
heard on the high old fashioned door
pT the jury room.-
Some ' of the lawyers had not yet
returned from dinner-nor had Judge
Tucker" put in an appearance.
Baliff Kelley went to the door and
then hurried to Walter Stef fens, the
court clerk, - and whispered, "They
are ready to report."
Mr. Steffens got Judge Tucker and
the absent lawyers on the telephone
and in ten minutes all was ready.
Mr. Hulett was plainly laboring
under Buppresesd emotion as he rose
and faced the court.
"Have you reached-a verdict, gen
tlemen?" asked Judge Tucker. '
"We have,'-replied the foreman.
"You may deliver it."
News Agency Not Guilty.
Mr. Hulett first gave the directed
vefdict of no case against the Solo

award against the Tribune was then
given, and the clerk recorded the

REVIEW OF FORD CASE.
MT. CLEMENS, Mich., Aug. 13. It
was In June 23, 1916, after Mexican
bandits had raided Columbus, N. M.,
and military preparedness ' was a
burning issue, not only because of the
Mexican menace, but because of the
conflagration in Europe, that the Chi
cago Tribune printed its famous edi
torial headed "Ford is an Anarchist."
Editorial writers of the Tribune tes
tified that they had followed Mr. Ford's
pacifistic propaganda, but had not re
cognized it as a real danger to the
country until a news item . was re
ceived from Detroit that Mr. Ford
was trying to discourage the recruit
ing of the guard which had been or
dered to the Rio Grande. The item,
authenticity of which was denied by
Ford witnesses, stated that the Ford
company would not pay the salaries
of-employes who went to the border,
hold their places for them nor care
for their dependents.
It was then that the "editorial was
written. It called Mr. Ford an "ig
norant idealist" and remarked that his
views on disarmament might be dif
fefent if his factories were on the Rio
Grande instead of the peaceful Can-
adian border.
Counsel for the manufacturer . at
first filed suit in the federal court at
Chicago, but later withdrew it and
instituted proceedings in the state
court at Detroit. Here the Tribune ap
plied for a change of venue and Judge
James G. Tucker of the circuit court
of Macomb county, at Mt. Clemens
was agreed upon to hear the case.
Selection of a jury began May 12. It
consisted of eleven farmers and one
roadbuilder.
A feature of the case was, the pro
duction by the defenant of more than
twenty witnesses from the Mexican
border to testify to raids, .murders and
other acts which to the mind of
Tribune counsel established tile fact

majority of farms and food deal
ers were not profiteering, but that
tne suggested amendment to the
food control act extending it to
clothing and providing a criminal
penalty of $5000 fine or two years
imprisonment, or both, was neces
sary to make effective the cam
paign against those who are dis
honestly gouging the public. There
was a division of opinion among
the senators as to the advisability
of the new laws, several declaring
that the amendment gave the de
partment of justice too drastic
powers over commerce, while oth
ers 'questioned the constitution
ality of extending the life of the
food control act beyond the dec-la-Uon

"Given this penalty we can

retorted crisply. "And then you

First Barrage of 15 000 Cans Vegetables
Arrrivcs in Bisbee Today to Help War on
High Cost Living; Bacon Coming Later
Uncle Sam's attack upon the high
cost of living in Bisbee will open to
day with a barrage of 15,000 cans of
vegetables that will shoot In from El
Taso. T 1 '
Mayor Erickson was Informed last
night by wire from the war surplus
supply chief in that city, Capt. A. L.
Enger, that th long awaited carload
of canned stuff for which Bisbeeites
have been, fcmnbling over each other
to order this week, was on its way.
Nd definite information as to the car
load of baton has been received, how
ever. The following food lineup is assured
to Bisbee. according to the El Paso
wire:. . ... . ' T ' ". . .
5040 2 pound cans stringless beans,
at 9 cents.
5040 2-pound cans sweet corn, at 9
cants. , '
5040 2-pound cans peas, at 9 cents.
492Q 2pound cans tomatoes at, 9
cents. .
4560 3 pound cans tomatoes at 11
cents. s
Bisbee folk who have placed their
orders for this- food will be accommo
dated as 'soon as R. J. Wilbert is able
to tabulate and check np the. flood of
business that has kept his office sub
merged the past few days, so Mr.
Wilbert and Mayor Erickson announc
ed last night. -
It was also announced that rebates
will be given on the difference in the
price lists, at the time the goods are
delivered.
Mayor Erickson estimated last night
that nearly1 $10,000 worth of provisions
have been ordered by Bisbeeites. He
was disappointed in being unable to
get a line oil the bacon shipment, de
claring that no response had been re
ceived to his many wire queries.
Mr. Wilber reported another land
office business yesterday on the food
orders.
Comparatively few orders were
booked at the postoffice. Postmaster
Bailey stated that in the majority of
applicants, a case order, which is the
minimum to he shipped by parcel post,
was considered too much. He record
ed a number of ' orders, however,
amounting to several hundred dollars.
The postoffice will continue to book
orders until Monday. Only a small
percentage of the variety of foods on
which prices were furnished, by the
government Wednesday have been

Lola Dolores, known to everyone in
Tombstone as "Granny," Tombstone
centenarian, " having celebrated her
100th anniversary on March 17 of this
year, passed away yesterday. Death
came at 11:30 o'clock, following a
period of 24 hours' unconsciousness,
caused by no illness, the functions of
the body merely ceasing to perform
their duties, and the aged pioneer
passed away as if in sleep.
With the passing of "Granny,"
there could be written a history, dat
ing back to the early Spanish con
quests of Mexico. She later came to
the states, which was then part of
the Gadsden purchase, and was one of
the earliest settlers in Cochise county,
going to Tombstone where she had re
sided ever since. She lived to see
four generations of offspring, leaving
a daughter, Mrs. Claiidio Lares, with
whom she had resided in hr past
quarter century of existence, and nu
merous grand-children and great
grand-children, many of whom reside
in Tombstone and other parts of the
state. ,
During her last quarter century the
aged - woman had never seen an 111
day m her life, although she had
gradually been growing weaker, and
due to the loss of her palate a num
ber of years ago she could ' not talk,
but still retaining her eyesight, could
be seen walking f bout the streets of
th city, either to do her shopping or
visiting friends. She steadfastly, up
to her. last days refused to accept as
sistance from her daughter or rela-
tives, earning money by the sale of
fancy Spanish drawn work, which she
fashioned by her own hands.
The funeral will be held this afternoon.
Italian Residents of Bisbee Mourn Loss
Of $700; Bogus Stock Artist the Cause
Bisbee Italian residents are minus
over $700 today as the result of the
operation of an alleged clever bogus
stock artist of Roman nationality
who found business brisk when here
a week ago.
The man, who gave the name of
John Tassi, was placed under arrest
yesterday in Clifton by Sheriff A. H.
Slaughter of Greenlee county on the
complaint of a Clifton victim. He Is
said to have disposed of over $500
worth of his stock In that place.
Tassi's game was bared here by a
fellow Italian who was working
with him on a 15 per cent basis and
who, failing to get the 15 per cent,
went to the police -with his tale of
woe. On the complaint of Charles
Perarei, a Naco Water, company em
ploye who was a 50 ' share buyer,
Judge James Allison issued a war
rant for Tassi's arrest. The justice
was informed by wire yesterday or
the man's apprehension in Clifton, i
Tassi purported to sell shares in
the Johnstone Tire & Rubber com
pany of Chicago. He presented the
buyers with nice little engraved cer
tificates that bore what was supposed
to be signatures of officers of that
company. The Johnstone company
has declared the certificates "phony"
and the signatures a forgery.
Officials here yesterday were sat
isfied that Tassi would not be
brought here as the Clifton charges
would be sufficient to hold him.
Unless he had a lot of money on
his person when" taken, the Bisbee
"stockholders" are conceded to be out
of luck.

the malice assumed in the mere pub

they charged the Tribune was pro

theory advanced was that by Interven

WORLD TRADE CENTER WITH 01
SEAPORT SEEW BY HOVAL A; SMITH
Pioneer Mining Engineer, in Address Before Luncheon Club,
Says Boundary Line, Under Terms of Gadsden Purchase,
Rightly Runs Due West From Nogales, Giving Arizona a Port
On Gulf; Tells How Taft Favored the Port Acquisition
Rail Union Chief
Hoval A. mltli, pioneer mining
pnginetr ana builder of the Warren
district, was the principal speaker
before the Luncheon club at the Cop
per Queen hotel yesterday noon and
in a brief but forceful talk on "Ari
zona's Port Possibilities," drew a
prophetic picture of a future Arizona,
boasting her own seaport, with an
outlet to the ocean a id a world trade
In her products of mine and range
and farm.
Mr. Smith, who has made a close"
study of his subject both along the
border and in Washington, showed
that under the terms of the original
water at San Diego, which a southern
cabal was then exploiting. -Thus 1
round at the outset that we apparent
ly are suffering today for the fac-
tional differences of 75 to 100 years
ago.
"Gadsden was commissioned basic
ally to get this railroad right of way,
wnich would mean that much addi
tional to the south's slave holding
states. Gadsden left Washington for
Mexico in 1S52, found Santa Anna,
then president of Mexico, amenable
and negotiated the purchase for $10,
000,000. The treaty was drawn up
and signed but was kept secret until
Gadsden purchase, the boundary line! 1S53. Two and a half million dol
should have been run due west from
Nogales, instead of taking a slant 60
to 70 miles to the north as at pres
ent. Had the line" been run as orig
inally intended, the delta of the Colo
rado river and the natural harbor of
Port Lobos would now be in Arizona
territory.
Forefathers Aslsep at the Switch,
Mr. Smith blamed the mistakes of
our forefathers for their neglect In
not taking over this seemingly dreary
waste of desert at the time of its
purchase from Santa Anna, then
president of Mexico. That we have
slept on our rights does not, however,
mean that the territory is irretrievab
ly lost. It is not too late to get what
Is ours by right and the boundary line
should be rectified and the territory
acquired by negotiation or purchase
in a friendly and business like wav.
"I was in Washington in 19J1." Mr.
Smith said, "when a friend of mine
suggested that it wr.s about time Ari
zona should arrange for cheaper
transportation rates which would
bring In a vast tonnage of low-grade
ores, and extend the mineral life of
the state for generations.
"At that time there was no Roose
velt ;dam, and the vast agricultural)
icoiuit8 oi me siaie wnicn irriga
tion ; brought about were undreamed
of. A seaport, of course, was the
answer to the cheaper transportation
problem, and while Arizona was with
in about 60 miles of tide water on
an air line, the first problem that
prsented itself was the fact that the
available- ports were in possession of
our neighboring republic to the
south. I then began looking up the
data to discover how the people of
our revolutionary days in Alabama
and Georgia got egress to the sea
thrown territory then owned by Spain
and also how they got through to the
delta of the Mississippi through ter
ritory owned by France.
"I . found -that the policy then was
mostly one of aggression. They simp
ly went through this territory to their
destination without paying much at
tention to the ; rights of France or
Spain. Things' have changed since
then, of course, and such methods
in this day of high ideals would be
discountenanced. Finally the prob
lem .was solved "on a solid basis by
the purchase of Florida.
Gadsden's Mission.
"Then I began looking into what
motives had guided Gardsden in ar
ranging for his purchase. N Through
President Taft I gained access to the
historical data on the deal and found
that .Gadsden had been given a -secret
commission by President Pierce to
go to Mexico City and acquire the
territory . south of the Gila river.
"It was deemed necessary at that
time to, find a reasonable grade
through tlia southern states to tide-
la rs was paid down, leaving eeven
and a half millions due
"About that time Santa Anna need
ed mcney and called for the balance
and the sale became public. It is true
that Santa Anna was deposed soon af
terward as a result of the sale,, but
this did not affect the validity" of the
treaty. There were violent contro
versies raging at the time and the
data showed that . the southerners
wanted a railroad in the south, while
the abolitionists, who were fighting
them, wanted no more territory ac
quired in the southwest and were
eager to accept a boundary line from
60 to 100 miles north of where it
should have been.
Factional Row Lost Port.
"On looking over the data on the
boundary, I found that the line should
have run due west from Nogales, in
stead Of making the northern bend it
does at present. It was evident that
the southern faction, wanted the line
kept is far as possible from any oth
er tide water port except San Diego,
which they themseives owned.
"Thus we are laboring under the
conditions of 70 years ago. We are
here only 190 miles from tide water
and there is no reason why we should
not have a port. The first result
would be to bring into productive
ness the millions of tons of this dis
trict's low grade ore.
"Studying the territory, I saw the
strategic importance of the chain of
Tiburon islands -off- the coast and
pointed out to the navy , department
what an effective system of fortifica
tions they would make possible. Sec
retary Von Meyer was enthusiastic
for the project. . .
Fine Base for Invading Foe. '"
"I pointed out to the war depart
ment and to President Taft the fact
that in case of war an enemy to our
west would certainly not try to land
he. troops on our strongly fortified
Parifin coast, but would come up
through the cellar door, by way of the
Gulf of California, land her .troops
near the delta of the Colorado and
march up into the very heart of our
Salt River valley. What a -wonderful
base of operations this fertile country
would make for an Invading enemy!
"So situated, the foe could cut the
Southern Pacific railroad and be in
full control of a region rich in all the
necessities for any army and 600 to
700 . miles east of San Francisco. It
would simply be the line of least re
sistance- which an intelligent enemy
would take advantage of.
"From the agricultural standpoint,
I found that the land we had so
carelessly' let slip away . from us,
would easily support a million peo
ple. I had the support for the pro
ject at that time of President Taft,
the war, navy and interior depart
ments and the support of California,

"ARIZONA'S PORT POSSIBILITIES"
B
ISBEE men of affairs who heard the illuminating talk before
the Luncheon Club by Hoval A. smitn yesteraay must nave
come away with eyes opened, a widened viewpoint and a
riaar viainn nf the possibilities Arizona has before her. Ari
zona as the center of a new world trade. .Arizona with a seaport at
her cellar door. Arizona the outlet for an inland empire of mines and
range and farms and orchards such as the world has never seen.
No, it is not a dream. It is an actuality of the not distant future,
backed by hard, cold facts and figures as inevitable as the scheme
of things which nature herself is working out. Mr. Smith's brief talk
made as clear as crystal a problem that has been fogged about by
the mists of precedent and the mistakes of our forefathers.
The port which Ariozna some day will have is at the head of the
gulf of Lower California; the outlet for our state's products is the
delta of the Colorado river. That this territory is not now a part
of Arizona. Mr. Smith pointed out. is due to the fact that our empire
builders of 70 years ago lacked the vision to appreciate the potential
riches of the dreary wastes of sand and desert in the lower reaches of
the Colorado river.
Data still on file at Washington shows that the original Gadsden
purchase contemplated the extension of the boundary line due west
from Nogales. instead of taking the bias angle 60 or 70 miles to the
north as it is now located. This due-west boundary line would place
well within the borders of Arizona the natural harbor of Port Lobos
at the head of the Gulf of California and the outlet of the Colorado
river.
That we did not assert our rights and take over this territory at
the time of the Gadsden purchase was the work of a group of pros
pective railroad builders who had purchased the land where San
Diego is now located and who did not want a rival seaport annexed to
the United States. The boundary line was drawn as it is at present
and through generation after generation this nation, busy with other
affairs has slept upon her rights.
But it is not too late to acquire that which is ours. Since Mex
ico has held this tract since 1853. when the terms of the Gadsden
purchase were first made public, let negotiations be entered into
for its purchase or for th9 acquirement of port privil
eges. This tract of 8000 or so square miles is utterly
worthless to Mexico; rather it is a liability to her, as Mr. Smith
pointed out. Undoubtedly the transfer can be arranged on a business
like and friendly basl3.
Now that Arizona need3 a seaport as an outlet for her millions
of tons of metal ore and for the products of her irrigated lands, she
mould not be made to suffer for tic mistakes and the sectional dif
ferences of our ancestor.
WHITHER, WHENCE, AND WHY
- .. - . . V. 9 n tVtiif,. TBT3kPCL tt TIT 1 T1 fl
SOME fOlKs are ioriuaaie euuugu, wi iut " " " i""
to be born "put."
That is they start out by being a Democrat or a Republican,
a radical, or a conservative, and they never change.
They buttress their soul each year with new belief in the infalli
liblty or their faith, and regard all outside their camp as crooks,
enemies, forsaken aliens, and without hope of a hereafter. Such
minds miss a lot of exercise, and also much confusion.
Your true - conservative clings to the feet of his ancient idols,
and never loosens his graps of faith, no matter what storms sweep
over him. Your born radical keeps agitating, regardless of argument,
or proof of the error of his theories. J
Most of us are whipped about by the. contending tides; we ebb
with the sare and sane crowd, and surge withMhe insurgents.
One day we regard the plea of the suffering wage serf, and find
our heart melting in pity at this sad plight, and the next we get mixed
up in some riotous strike, called 'without due cause by some fiery
agitator, and, as the brick bats rattle from our beans, we feel the
tides of reform ebbing away, and leaving us stranded, gasping on
the Bhoals of hide bound standpatism.
Somewhere between the outposts of these two contending camps
is the line of truth but the mass of the people surge and sway back
and forth over this thin line, are pushed by the Dolshevik one day,
and by the imperialistic the next, until about all the line is good for
is to be an imaginary mark for our souls to shoot at.
Most of the world wants to do the right thing; more so today
than ever, but most of the world has a terrible lot of trouble making
up its mind what is the right.
Neither the communism of riotous Russia, nor the high-handed
regime of the Hohenzollerns appeal as a haven of refuge for a won
dering world; and we find communistic Russia a bit tired of its free
dom and republican Germany bending a more attentive ear to the
picas of the deposed Imperialism.

oil or mining enterprise grows by leaps and bounds.
Honestly operated companies drilling oil wells on favorable
ground have more than an even chance of bringing in pro
duction.. The purchaser of oil shares should make a very thorough
investigation before buying stock and see to it that he is getting into
a company that is really striving for production and is not formed
for the purpose of drilling for wealth in the pockets of investors.
The real wealth that comes from the striking of an oil gusher is
a prize well worth fighting for. It takes brains and hard work to suc
cessfully drill an oil well, and the world applauds the operator who
brings in production. There is real sport in playing the oil game,
and the big. broad minded operator really thinks as much of being
able to bring in a fine producer as he does of the money it means to
him.
The Texas oil boom is going to grow greater during the next
several months and in every section of the union there Is going to bo
greater interest displayed in petroleum investments. There will be
good stocks and bad stocks offered an.l it is up to the investor not
to lose hlfrhead but to see that his dollars invested go into legiti
mate enterprises. Every Investor should be like the Missourian
who named .misstate and said, "You've got to show me." There are
any number of good stocks being offered to the public, no why lose

selves to support the movement in
the-43 states of the west to work for
government regulation of all grazing
areas of the public domain.
The association was not formed
without a long and heated session,
wherein the question of grazing at all
on the forest tracts trembled in the
balance because the government had
collected damages for illegal grazing
which had resulted in- crowding the
forage areas and injuring the grass
without materially benefiting any of
the permittees and disorganizing the
entire grazing district.
The meeting was attended by Su
pervisor Paul P. Pichlynn and his as
sistant, Mr. Wales, and by all the
stockmen of the district.
After every one had discussed the
condition of affairs the stockmen de
cided to co-operate with the forest
service. and the Tumacocori Stock
growers' association" was organized
with Nonie Bernard as president,
Arthur Noon as vice-president, Harry
Saxon, secretary and treasurer, and
the selection of an advisory board to
co operate with the forest service.
This committee consists of Nonie
Bernard. Joe Wise. Harry Saxon, Tex
Marstella and Phil Clark. A consti
tution and byjaws were adopted and
as soon as the permittees in the dis
trict are signed up -the association
will be underway.
After the meeting Supervisor Pltcn
lvnn and his assistant, Mr. Wales,
were the guests of the stockmen at a !
broncho busting, bull-dogging and rop
ing contest.
upon at a meeting of the legion com
mittee which has been . placed in
charge of arrangements at Phoe
nix. The general plan is to make Amer
ican legion day one of general reunion
for the veterans of all wars, in which
the United States has participated.
The grand review will be headed by
veterans of the Civil war. to be fol
lowed by the survivors of the Span
ish-American war and the Mexican
border war and the veterans of the
great war.
Arizona is estimated to have 10,000
returned service men within her bor
ders and if even half of these can be
counted on to attend the gathering
will be the largest event of its kind
ever held since thesigning of the
armistice. J
The committee has secured the use
of the old mineral building at the fair
ground which will be fitted up as a
museum. Here will be gathered every
possible form of momento brought
back from the battle fields of France
and Germany. Fred Rowlen, secretary
of Frank Luke post, of the American
legion at Phoenix, has been appoint
ed curator of the collection and to
him has bee.n assigned the task of
gathering the materials, properly la
beling the same and seeing that it is
returned to the doners.
MIAMI BUYS CARLOAD
OF ARMY SURPLUS FOOD.
MIAMI, Aug. 14. From two to five
people have been busy taking orders i
for bacon and canned goods at the
town hall on Gibson street. The mini
mum carload of 30 tons has been or
dered, and if orders continue to come
in until the close of business it may
reach the maximum weight of 40 tons,
in order to accommodate all orders.
The Central Labor Union com
mittee which had been appointed
to assist Town Clerk Arthur in tak
ing care of j the orders is more than
grateful to a number of ladies who
have given many hours of their" time
and hard work to assist the com
mittee. There have been as many
as 25 people around the desks at one
time making out their lists and it re
quired tact and business ability to
keep up with the work, which the.
ladies displayed markedly. Lester
Doane, at the head of the labor com
mittee at the town hall, said:
"This is the last day to get in
your orders for the first carload,'
and we are certainly delighted in the
way the people have responded to our
call."
Judge Arthur telegraphed the
distributing station at Fort Bliss,
Texas, concerning the immediate
shipment or the car. Sugar, milk and
hams have been included in the list
and while they came at the eleventh
hour many took advantage of the
situation to include these with their
orders.
There Isn't a darned thing the matter with this country except

PHOENIX PHONE LINES.'
PHOENIX:, Aug. 14". For the first'
time in the history of the Phoenix!
telephone and telegraph office, ac-
cording to local operators, the local,
telegraph lines were knocked out for.
periods of from one to three minutesj
at a time yesterday. The wires show-,
ed clearly the effect of an earth cur-,
rent, R. E. Syler of the operating de-
partment explained, as the grounded
wires picked up a "foreign potential"'
which sometimes neutralized the cur-J
rent in the telegraph wires and some-;
times reinforced it.
The first trouble was noted about
midnight Sunday. The strange cur
rent made frequent visits during the
morning, but had ceased to agitate
the wires by 3 o'clock. Its effect
could be watched in the operating
room at the local Mountain . States
Telephone and Telegraph office,
where there aire relays connecting
with wires to Denver. San Francisco,
Los Angeles, El Paso and other,
points. I
When a wire is "talking" a needle
indicates the making and breaking of
the current, varying .about 10 amper-J
ers on either side of neutral. As soon
as the foreign potential entered the.
field, the needle would either stand at'
0 for a time or swing almost out of
sight on one side or the other. The
effect was very Interesting to local
operators who had never seen it hap-1
pen here.
The strange current was not pecu-'
liar to Arizona, but was felt all over;
the country, and Is said to be due to
the aurora borealis, or northern!
lights. The aurora borealis is said by
scientists to be due to sun spots
which exercise a magnetic influence
over this sphere. i
CHEAPER CEMENT IS NOW
OFFERED STATE ENGINEER.
PHOENIX, Aug. 14. Cement is
coming down. At least it seems to
be, for the state highway department
has received bids that point that
way. Bids for cement for state high
ways and bridges have been received
from four different places, including
some in California and Texas.
All but one of the bids was on a
base of $4 per barrel, with 60 cents
reduction, for sacks, less per cent
off for cash in 10 days, less 3 per cent
discount because of use on federal
projects, making the price 3.31 1-3.
The bid of the Sans Antonio-Portland
Cement company, on the other
hand, was a base price of $3.55 less 60
and 50 cents, making the price $2.90
per barrel, or 41 1-3 cents less than
the other bids submitted.
Figured on the basis of the thou
sands of barrels of cement that are
to be used this will make a very ap
preciable saving to the state on high
way construction.

SPECIAL SUFFRAGE SESSION
DOUGLAS. Aug 14. Mrs. Nellie
Hayward, who is chairman of the wo

from this county, ha3 expressed her
self as favorable to a special session
of the legislature in this state for the

Mrs. Hayward wrote to Governoi
Campbell endorsing the special ses
sion proposition and offering to at
tend such a session withoift expense
to the state.
"I am very anxious to have Arizona
join other states in the ratification or
the woman surrrage amendment with
out delay and I believe that practical
ly all the women In the state would
agree with me in this desire. It would
only require a one day session of the
legislature, as it is believed that ev
ery member of both house and senate
would favor the measure. I dislike
the idea of - Arizona waiting to take
action' on this popular measure nntil
practically all other Blates have act
od. Arizona was a leader for suf
free and 1 desire to see the stata
act promptly now. I hope the friends
of suffrage in the ; state will join
hands in requesting '("governor Camp

WHAT OTHER PAPERS SAY
INCOME OF THE SUPER-RICH.
New York Tribune.
The public mind has a fixed belief
that the rich grow richer under an
conditions and circumstances. But
the "income tax report does not sug
gest that such was the tendency dur
ing 1S17. The wagerise swelled the
dollar income of a great number of
little fellows, but the dollar income of
the very rich, especially after surtaxes
were paid to the government, aver
aged less.
INSUFFICIENT SECURITY.
New York Times.
To get money at 4 per cent, the in
vestment must be secure beyond all
chance or question. With the Russian
example of democratization of indus
try fresh in mind 'and still before its
eyes, the American public would not
be very eager to supply money at 4
per cent or any other rate for the pur
pose of putting the railroads into the
hands of the representatives of laDor
and the politicians.
THE TEST OF GOOD SENSE.
New York Herald. '
There is too much good sense In
the great body of the American peo

hopelessly bend to the whirlwind of
temiorary illusion. Political charges
of personal timidity simply add to the
confusion and danger. The situation
demands nothing but courage to face
the facts and strength to combat the
storm that is already upon us. It is
not a matter of politics but patriot
ism.
SIMPLY .ARROGANT.
New York World.
In the last three years the railroad
employes have received hundreds of
millions of dollars in wage increases
for which the general public is paying.
As a reward for its 'generosity thf
country is to be taken by the throat
and choked Into submission if "the
most complicated economic issues that
have ever confronted it are not set
tled forthwith. If there is any differ
ence between that kind of arrogance
and the arrogance of the German gen-,
eral staff in July, 1914, we should like
to know what it is.
AN UNDESIRABLE IF;
New York Sun.
Mr. Wilson's administration must
let the American people have their
own wheat, bought from the farmers
through the treasury with their own
money; it must let them have it at
i reasonable prices in a free market
working under the law of supply and
demand, or the cost of living will not
I come down. For unless he lets them
have their own wheat in that way corn
will stay up, corn may go higher. And
as corn stays up or goes higher all
food will stay up or go higher. If it
does there will be hell to pay.

GRAND CIRCUIT POSTPONED
PHILADELPHIA, Aug. 14. The
grand circuit trots were again post
poned today because of rain. A double
program has been arranged for tomor
row. Lowell Loses Its
Pitcher; Ed Scott
Will Arrive Today
With the arrival of Eddie Scott, the
Indian first baseman and the new out
fielder he has discovered at Ray set
for today, and with Roy Brashear ne
gotiating for "Red" Smith, a classy
outfielder from California, it looks as
if the regular Bisbee baseball team
would hang up another victory next
Sunday when it meets the Nineteenth
Infantry team from Douglas at theJ
Warren baseball grounds. Toner will
pitch the game as usual and he says
the old "souper" was never better.
Lowell"s team got a jolt last night
when Brandt, the crack pitcher, took
a train foi the oil fields around
Casper, Wyo. Manager Bert Whaling,
however, is negotiating for a pitcher
named Armstrong, from Douglas, to
take his place. Lowell and the First
Cavalry team will clash again next
Sunday at Douglas.

LOUGHREfDOi
TO WEIGHT FOR
CHAMBERS BOUT
Frank Loughrey weighed in yester
day afternoon at 153 pounds with his
clothes on, indicating that he is al
ready down to the requirements for
his fight here August. 22 with Russell
Chambers, the speedy cavalry pugil
ist from Douglas. 'Loughrey is hit
ting the road every morning to get
hts wind in condition for , the ten
round bout and is boxing every after
noon with all-comers.
That Douglas will have a big repre
sentation at the fight was the word
received from there yesterday by O.
S. French. In a long-distance tele
phone call Clyde . Brennan placed or
ders for ten reserved Beats for J.
Wilmuth and party.! This is only one
of several groups j being made up at
the Smelter City who want to see
Chambers in action against the
"Philadelphia Bear-cat."
Secretary Tom Egan and Promoter
G. J. Kelly had men out yesterday
advertising the ma,tch and tickets
will be placed on sale Saturday. The
places where the tickets may be ob
tained will be announced later. That
the fight is attracting considerable
attention elsewhere is indicated by
the following taken yesterday from
the sporting page of the El Paso Her
ald: "Referee Jack' McDonald has re
ceived an offer to officiate in the
Loughrey-Chambers ten-rouad contest
to be held .August 22 at Bisbee.
Ariz., and while his buisness interests
here require quite a bit of his time he
is seriously considering making the
trip. Jack has received a letter from
George Winfrey',-manager of the
Phelps Dodge interests in Bisbee and
one of the biggest boosters of boxing
in the-western. city, stating that the
fans desired that lie officiate in the
next card and askmg if he would
make the trip. The contest is one be
tween the middle weights, Chambers
being the boy who gave Johnny SuvJ
enberg such a tough fight at Ft. Sam
Houtson during the military tourna
ment . , .
Worked in One Bout.
"McDonald officiated in the first
boxing contest held ia Fisbee under
the new state law legalizing ten-found
bouts in Arizona and his capable
work at that time made a hit with the
fans. Bobby Burns, of Ft. Sam
Houston, and Young Lincoln, met in
the initial contest (and more than
2500 fans were in attendance when
time was called. Since that time
crowds have not been so good in the
mining city but it 'is proposed to put

So Near
the bouts on in the baseball park and
not in a crowded theater so that ev
eryone' would get a seat from where
they could view every inch of the
canvas indifferent to the price paid.
"Boxing in Bisbee is held under the
auspices of the chamber of commerce
there and the fans are always assured
of a square deal. Kif Fred George
recently had charge of the glove game
in that city but found it necessary to
give up that business when he came
to El Paso to enter training for the
Sundenberg battle. Fred intends, to
stay here until his next meeting with
Sundenberg and will begin training
during the latter part of the present
month for this bout." i
Fight Facts For
Fans of Bisbee
Bobby Green alleges he was not in
physical condition when he met Al
McManus at Tucson last week. If
Green's complaint is true the Tucson
promoters must be slacking in the en
forcement of the state boxing law
which makes it compulsory for all
fighters to be examined by a reputa
ble physician before being allowed to
enter the ring. Local promoters ad
here to the letter of the law and are
very urgent in their demands that all
fighters meet the physical test before
going into the ring.
. Fighting Beaver of Yuma and Eddie
Huse, who claims the welterweight
championship of the Pacific coast, will
meet in a scheduled eight round bout
at Yuma tonight. Huse is anxious to
perform before the fans of this dis
trict. Phoenix fans are now booked to
watch ex-Champion Ad Wolgast on
Labor day.
diet Neff and Al McManus are
booked for Tucson Labor day. This
bout will determine how much Mc
Manus has improved since his fight
with Carter.
Leonard should not . be censored
for refusing to fight Carter at this
time. The champion would have
everything to lose and nothing to win
in a match with Carter. True Carter
has whipped some good men to date,
but there is a decided jump from
Wallace to Leonard and Tommy will
have to demonstrate he carries a
kayo punch before the fans will place
much stock in a Leonard-Carter fight.
Sailor Dunne is going over to Je
rome to do another six round prelim
inary with some fistic phenom. Dunne
should bo given credit for his willing
ness to come back for more.
General Pershing has had ovations
in Paris and London but the real
music to his ears will be the cheers
which greet him when he lands again
on his native soil.

8TOCK8 AND BONDS
.NEW YORK. Ana. 14. In its out
standing features today's stock market
traversed the ground made familiar
by the preceding sessions of the week,
trading reflecting the same profes
sional characteristics. Uncertain price
conditions governing the market pre
pared no new features apart from the
further relaxation of call money which
fell from the open rates of 5 to 5
per cent to 4 per cent for both classes
of collateral by midday.
The industrial situation was more
favorable, as indicated bv the onintnn
of Director General Hines that the
strike of railroad shopmen is on the
wane, and from news orUinatinz in
leading mill centers, wnlch reported
increased production. Equipments and
oils were the backbone of the market,
so far as it manifested anv bettor
tone, a few speculative specialties also
contributing to tne . constructive ac
count at variable gains.
Rails dropped most of the time,
standard shares losing 1 to 2 points.
Selling made little headway until
the final hour, with steel and other
favorites yieldm 2 to 5 Doints at their
beet. Sales 1,000,000 shares.
Excepting Liberty issues, which
were firm, the bond market inclined
moderately downward on a. broader
volume of offering; Total sales, par
value. 111.850.000. Old United StateH
bonds unchanged.
THE GRAIN MARKETS
CHICAGO? Aug. 14. Government
seizure of food stocks within waliHnsr
distance, of th Chicago board of
trade completely unnerved holders of
grain and .provisions today, and did
much to force a biz- smash in nrirea
The close in the - corn market was
semi-demoralized, 7c to 8?4c net
lower with September 81.82 to
and December $1.44 to $1,45. Oats
finished 2 to 2c down and provis
ions off 90c to $3.35.
General selling and lack of rtomanrt
with which the day started in the com
crowd grew more and more pronounc
ed until the last hour, when the flurrv
to unload and to sell short became
wild enough to try the poise of the
hardiest veteran of the pit. A big
break in the price of hogs was the
first attack which owners of corn had
to withstand. Later depression of for
eign exchange adJed to bearish senti
ment and the acme was reached when
the seizure of .food hoards in Chicago
was announced as no longer a threat,
but a reality. September delivery col
lapsed the worst of. any option on the
list Quotations for that month, as
well as for new crop deliveries, closed
at about the lowest point of the ses
sion. '
Oats toDnled over with
heaviest selling was from houses that
recently have been the most ctive
buyc?
- Provisions were swent irroatcihi
downward with grain and hogs. News
of government price fixing in Finion
appeared to have a specially weakening
effect in addition to the CatlRPfl Tl Pur
at hand.

spot $5.55 bid. Spelter, quiet; spot,

But Letter From the Governor
To Scout Kelly Here Says
State Boxing Commission Is
Not Possible Under the Law
G. J. Kelly, the baseball scout and
boxing promoter, yesterday received
a letter from Governor Thomas E.
Campbell showing that the state's
chief executive is thoroughly in sym
pathy with the efforts of Bisbee
fight "fans" to keep the ring game on
a high plane and prevent its falling
into questionable hands. While the
governor pointed out that Kelly's
plan for a state boxing commission
was impossible under the present box
ing law, he agreed with the match
maker's view that the game must be
safeguarded against doubtful nieth
ods. The governor's letter follows!
"My dear Mr. Kelly I acknowledge
receipt of your letter of the 12th inst.,
setting forth the situation in boxing
circles in the state. and believe you
are on the right track. However,
there is a bill which governs this
sport an-1 therefore it will be impos
sible to put your suggestion to have
a boxing commission governing it in
erfCct.
"In my judgment, the way the game
is now going, it will, necessitate, some
action' soon to maintain the sport on
r clean basis or boxing contests will
s'oon be a thing of the past, as the
public will not stand for such work.
Sincerely yours,
"Thomas E. Campbell, .
Governor."
Kelly got a wire . yesterday from
Tommy Carter, now at El Paso, want
ing a match in Bisbee. Carter boxes
Eddie Shannon at Miami on Labor
day and is anxious to get a bout here
after that. He says he will fight all
cottiers at 135 pounds.
Nick Gundy, who fought Linco:
hero the eleventh, meeU Jack Doug
las in El Paso tonight. Both men
have wired Kelly that they want to
meet the winner of the Lincoln-Fox
bout here on Labor day.
The "Zulu Kid," a clever, boy now
at Tucson, has also wired in asking
for a chance at the winner of the
Lincoln-Fox go. The "Zulu Kid" is
one of the best boys in the game, hav
ing boxed Wilde to a draw in England
and getting a draw with Pete Herman
at New Orleans.
Claimant of Land
Near Warren Still
Holding the Fort
t . . .
The fortunes of battle in the fight
for 160 acres of land near the Warren
Country club ebbed and flowed yes
terday, with Tom Leavy, who holds
u homestead claiui on the tract, sleep
ing on the property last night and the
night before, but without a roof over
his head. For said roof, including the
walls and floors of the house he had
built on the property Tuesday night,
had been hauled away by his oppo
nents, who claim title K for years
through mineral patents.
Leavy doesn't even know where his
house is, but he knows it was hauled
away, for when he was outflanked and
outnumbered Tuesday night he saw
the cohorts of the opposition load it
on a wagon and start off with it. The
dispute will be settled in the courts,
the county attorney having come over
last night from Tombstone to look
into the matter.-
The land is part "of the Warren
ranch, which has been leased, and the
leasers have been demanding that
Leavy get off, declaring his home
stead is superseded and that this fact
will 'become apparent as soon as the
papers go through the proper chan
nels in Washington..
Mrs. Kinney Dies

Mrs. J. E. Kinney, mother of Fted

the Ferguson mortuary and interment
made in Calvary cemetery.
The deceased was a native of Wash
ington but for the past 12 years had
resided at Douglas and Bisbee, or on
the ranch of her husband between
the two places. She had been In poor
health for several months and for
some time past had been a patient
at a local hospital, but all efforts to
save her lire were unavailing.
The deceased is survived by the

W. A. Cokeley Much Impressed
With Beauty of Warren, Tells
Of Huge Docking and Other
Building Projects in N. Y.
William A. Cokeley, chief appraiser
of the city of New ,York, was in Bis
bee yesterday on a brief visit to his
3on, Harry A. Cokeley, now of the
clerical force on Sacramento hill. Mr.
Cokeley has been inspecting every
port on the Pacific coast from Seattle
to San Diego, gathering data for use
in the immense harbor projects under
way around New ; York City.
A $20,000,000 dock system is now
under way on Staten Island and in
order to provide space for it it has
been necessary to condemn property
running into the millions. This will
be adjudicated in ;the courts in Octo
ber. Mr. Cokeley has been inspecting
ail the important ports in the country,
getting figures and data on valuations
to aid in fixing rates for the States
Island property condemned. 1
Since the war, and the stimulation
it gave to American shipping, there
has been a dearth of docking facili
ties. .'Mr. . Cokeley ; said yesterday.
Present docks, are unable to handle
either the volume of. shipping or take
care of the new giant vessels that
have been constructed. The new dock
6n Staten Island will take care of the
1000-foot leviathans of the sea which
will be the next development in ocean
traffic.' " " '' 5 t J
Mr. Cokeey, as appraiser of the
American metropolis, says the city is
preparing to spend a billion dollars a
year on public works, Including docks,
schools, parks, playgrounds, etc. This
sets a new high mark and will furnish
work for-thousands' of V the unem
ployed.' I was' particularly - struck by the
appearance of Warren when I came
through it," Mr. Cokeley said. "Com
mendable foresight was shown in lay
ing 'Out this sightly . little city of
homes away from and yet at the doors
of the' mines and stores where your
citizens work. On, a small scale it
represents the same idea we have in
New,'cYork, where the majority of. the
mople work In the city but live in
New Jersey." . .
Two Roads to Be

J. C. Ryan, engineer to the county

will be done by September first and

LI
Effort to Afford Hiqh Class
Entertainments to People of
Bisbee Praised By Speakers;
Many Tickets Are Purchased
The Luncheon club at its meeting
yesterday noon at the Copper Queen
hotel, again got behind the Musical
Events club and gave that newly
formed organization a friendly 'boost.'
Both Hoval A. Smith, the speaker of
the occasion, and Arthur Notman. told
of the meritorious efforts the club is j
making to bring to Bisbee during the
coming season five of the leading mu
sical attractions by the foremost art
ists of the world.
Mrs. Sam Frankenburg, one of the
organizers of the club and the chair
man of the committee on member
ship, was on hand and after the
luncheon took a number of orders for
season tickets. These tickets cost 16
and cover admission to all five of
the concerts planned, entertainments
which in the east would cost from $3
to $10 a seat for one performance.
The possession of a season ticket con
stitutes membership in the club.
Both Mr. Smith and Mr. Notman
spoke of the cultural benefits to the
community as . a whole which "would
result from giving concerts by thesj
eminent artists. '. ''.' j
Mrs. Frankenberg requests ' those I
who want season tickets to send in i
ftieir orders at once, as the supply is I
nearly gone. Only 400 season tickets I
will be sold, as that Is the approxi-j
mate capacity of the Grand theater, I
where the programs will be given.
Everyone will hope that Judge,
Lynch has at last reached the end of j
his rope.
