(By Review leased Wire).
PAf HINGTON, May 31. The ad
ministration's fight for a war
censorship on newspapers was
lost in congress today, at least
for the resent, when the house re
fused, by n vote of 181 to 144, to ac
cept .3 the modified censorship
section written into the espionage
bill in conference. The senate al
Tady is on record as opnosed to a
censorship bill, and leaders in con
gress do not expect any further ef
forts to enact one in the immediate
future.
The test in the house came on a
motion to recommit the espionage bill
with instructions that the censorship
regulations be eliminated. Despite a
determined attempt of Democratic
managers to line un the party strength
behind President Wilson's demand for
censorship; eleven Democrats, disre
garding their party's caucus decision,
voted in the negative.
White House Silent.
Conferees for the house will report
their instructions back to the senate

finally accented. It carries important
interpretations of the by-laws" and
authorization for the President) to lay
embargoes in time of war.
No comment on the outcome in the
houoe was forthcoming from the
White House. In the house debate
today, opponents of censorship ar
gued that a restriction such as the
conferees proposed would violate the
right of a free press. The voluntary
censorship, under which the coun

NATION FIGHTS
Head of War Mission, On
Floor of Senate, Declares
Entry of U. S. Into Struggle
Lends Moral Support.
(By Review Leased Wire).
WASHINGTON, May 31. The
prince of Udine, head of the Italian
war mission, on the floor of the sen
ate today, delivered a message to the
American people in the name of. King
Victor Emmanuel, welcoming the en
trance of the United States into the
war as the final justification of the
cause in which the allies are fighting.
The message breathed confidence in
ultimate victory.
"Italy." said the prince, "wants the
safety of her boundaries and her coast,
and she wants to secure herself
against new aggressions. But Italy
has not been and never will be an
element of discord in Europe, and as
she willed her own free national ex
istence at the cost of any sacrifice,
so she will contribute with all her
strength to the free existence and de
velopment of other nations."
The prince said Europe has been
plunged into the war "without any
justifying motives, perhaps without
any motive at all beyond the will of
a small oligarchy."
Of the entrance of the United States
after the violent offenses against
right had become clear and the Amer
ican flag had been insulted, he said:
"You bring us the sacred recogni
tion of our right; you bring us moral
confidence and the conviction that
our cause is holy, and that the great
free democracy shares our feeling.
our spirit and our hopes."
The prince was received with great
enthusiasm ' by the senate. He ap
peared in the full uniform of a naval
captain and was accompanied by the
other leading members of the mis
sion. A second loan of $100,000,000 is
to be made to Italy for June and an
nouncement is expected shortly. Of j
the original $100,000,000 about $60,
000,000 already has been expended
here and the balance is expected to
be used in the next few days.
Senior Officer of
U. S. Navy Called
(By Review Leased Wire)
WASHINGTON. May 31. American
naval officers everywhere today were
mourning the death of Rear Admiral .
Upshur, who, until his death here last
night of heart failure, was the oldest
living officer in the navy.
WHY
TO
A. Content. Catell. Phillips and Miss
Parker conspired to induce "divers
persons whose names are unknown"
to fail to register June 5. The defend
ants, alleged to be committees se
lected at the meeting of May 8. are
accused of having endeavored on May
24 to have the Graphic Press print
pamphlets entitled "Will you be draft
ed?" A copy of the text of the alleged
document made public by the federal
authorities contains the assertion,
"We will approve the action of any
one who refuses to register for con
scription." "The pamphlet says the
question of selective draft, "with its
implications for the future." is more
Important than the question of defeat
or victory in .the war; and that the
draft, as outlined in the new law, "is
abhorrent to any true conception of
democracy."
Urges Resistance.
The present administration and con
gress were "elected presumably be
cause they were expected to keep us
out of war." the document asserts,
and when war was declared there was
no referendum nor was there a refer
endum as to the selective draft, the
government "remembering perhaps
that the referendum in Australia had
resulted in a two to one vote against
conscription."
The pamphlet says that "if we want
to strike with the full strength of our
numbers we must refuse to register
for conscription' even if it puts us
in jail."
U.S. CITIZENS Iff
Americans Leaving This
Country Before-June 5 Will
Not Escape Draft Law, De
clares Gen. Crowder.
WASHINGTON, May 31. While the
legal machinery of the government
was operating today to stamp out agit
ation against the draft, the war de
partment took up another phase of
the matter dealing with the status of
Americans now in foreign countries.
Secretary Baker called upon Bri.
Gen. Crowder, judge advocate general
and provost marshall general of the
army, for an opinion as to the effect
of the new law upon Americans of mili
tary age residing abroad. Department
officials generally have presumed that
the privilege of citizenship would car
ry a duty for military service not af
fected by foreign residence, but no
formal ruling will be made until the
opinion of General Crowder has- been
received.
Many Americans of military age
now abroad have been eager to enroll.
j Registration cards have been furnish
ed to every American ambassy, lega
tion or counsuls and diplomatic and
consular officials have been authorized
to act as registration agents.
General Crowder appealed to the
press today to give prominent place
daily in regard to the registration re
quirements. The. statement outlines
the facts for which publicity of the
widest sort Is desired as follows:
"WHO MUST REGISTER: All male
persons (Citizens or aliens) born be

tonight. The Viliistas commander
took the town by surprise yesterday
morning, slipped out of the place dur
ing the night, and Kite TSday was re
ported to be moving up the Concho

a cloud of dust. A Mexican boy, who
was shot through the left lung, and
an aged Mexican camp follower who

The Mexican government lieutenant
returned to Ojinaga today to Investi

had departed. He remained only a
short time and returned to the Amnr-I

was no one left in the town.
Reports regarding Villa's where

no one who has crossed to the Am:

Ojinaga after the Villa commander
took possession there. There is little
doubt that Villa is in the Ojinaga dts

SIOUX FALLS. S. D., May 31.
Southeastern South Dakota and ad

witnessed, at 9:55 tonight, the most
striking meteoric display in thirty
years when a dazzling ball of fire
traversing almost the complete arc
of the sky, burst near the horizon
with a loud report. Its trail was
marked by vapor, as was the sky for
minutes afterward. Regions thickly
settled by foreigners reported much
fright among their population, some
believing an attack by a hostile force
was in progress.
Liberty Loan Facts
LIBERTY LOAN SPELLS IMMEDIATE
PROSPERITY.
What will be the effect on business of the successful subscription
of the two billion dollar Liberty Loan?
Do not worry, you Manufacturer, Merchant, Employe.
The immediate effect in every war has been that business should
be stimulated to the last degree. ,
Every railroad, every mill and every mine, every farm will be
pushed to its utmsot to meet the increased activity caused by the
government coming into the market as a buyer on an enormous scale.
The government is already talking of spending ten million dollars
in San Francisco for a city to house our soldiers. Does this not spell
immediate prosperity?
War for the next three years as regards business would mean a
kind of concentrated "prosperity" the lavish spending of vast sums
of money on our industries by our government.
The cost will come in loss of our young men, in waste of money
in unproductive lines and for the future in increased taxation. But
the cause of Civilization is worth the cost
A large oversubscription to the Liberty Loan will shorten the war.
And no one need hesitate to subscribe because he fears any possible
business depression in the immediate future.

changes. Senator Simmons said the

Several senator protested that the
provision was too drastic and would
prevent legitimate storing to equalize

Holding by farmers or others of the

is exempted.
Consideration of the administration
bill, which provides for a food sur

attack drove back the enemy from
points where he had gained a footing
the previous night northeast of Mont
Haut, our lines being completely" re-
"Yesterday five German airplanes

According to late information, other
enemy machines previously reported

INCREASE PASSENGER
INSTEAD OF FREIGHT
RATES IS SUGGESTION
(By Review Leased Wire).
WASHINGTON, May 31. Contend
ing that freight is paying a higher
proportionate rate than passenger
traffic, representatives of western
state railroad commissions today urged
the interstate commerce commission
to raise passenger fares instead of
granting the fifteen per cent general
increase in freight rates for which
the railroads are applying.
Data prepared by the commissions
showing earnings, expenditures, divi
dends and depreciation of the reads
were filed, with intent to show that
the roads are in fair financial condi
itnos with business increased and cre
dit unimpaired.,
Shippers' witnesses declared that
for carriers west of the Mississipp and
north of the Missouri rivers no emer
gency required a rate increase.

TO BE GIVEN
Greeted by a capacity house, the
Red Cross benefit show, which opened
at the Orpheum fieatre last nigut,
was a grand success in every way. The
cast did excellent and the costuming I
was perfect. The entire sflow went
without a hitch, .and every one. from I
the little boys to the matrons, carried j
their parts extraordinarily gc'od.
At the rise of the curtain, tile entire
company was assembled on the stage, j
in a pantomimic representation of all I
the nations. The entire world is sup-1
posed to be at peace, arid harmony pre-1
vails everywhere. Suddenly Austria i
attacks Servia, and, joined by Germa- i
ny and Turkey, they begin a general j
battle, in which every country repre-1
sented, takes part. Then the "sub- j
marines" attack the allies, and as Ger-!
many raises her sword over Belgium,
Columbia interposes, and the audience,
led by the Copper City l'our join in the
Star Spangled Banner.
Mrs. Cutler B. Whitwell, and Mrs.
Philip D. Wilson present the next num
ber, which is an interpretive dance,
"Day and Night." Mrs. Whitwell re
presents "Day," and Mrs. Wilson
"Night." They do a very difficult
dance, which is executed very good.
As they take a pose, children enter, j
representing "Children's Hour." Whil
the boys and girls are playing around. I
PEACE IS DEMAND
AT PEACE MEETING
(Continued From Page One)
gram from former United States Sen-,
ator John D. Works, of California. i'i
which he said: j
"We dishonored ourselves by de-'
daring war "without adequate or rea-1
sonable cause," were features of the
afternoon session today of the so-j
called first American conference on (
democracy and terms of peace. '
Several speakers severely criticized 1
the government, one declaring that
"within the last sixty days we have ;
completely transformed our govern
ment and the people have had nothing ;
to say about it, so far have they been
removed from control of their govern
ment." The same speaker, Gilbert E.
Roe, president of the Free Speech
League of America, added that "some
where along the line the voters of
this country must have a chance to
express themselves
Works' Telegram.
Norman L. Thomas, addressing the
meeting on "conscription and the
conscientious objector" charged that
"the attempt to force a man to fight
is an imposition of chattel slavery.'
"We must oppose the enactment of
such 'legislation." Thomas asserted,
"or all our hope, both of democracy
and peace, are made a mockery."
Former Senator Works, in his tele
gram, said in part:
"I am conscientiously opposed to
the war and in favor of bringing it to
a speedy close by any and every legit
imate way consistent with the honor
of our country. . We dishonored our
selves by declaring war without ade-1
quate or reasonable cause.
"The people of this country do not
want war. If the issue had been left
to them we would be at peace now.
Having been brought into this war
against their will, they should stand
firmly for peace and use every proper
means to bring it about.
"Alliance with foreign nations
should not be tolerated. Our hands
had been entirely free to tolerate !
peace without regard to the interests '
or desires of any other nation." ,
"Sccret Diplomacy" Assailed. '
The report of the "conference of,
Ameriran liberties." of w hich th ;
Rev. Richard W. Hogue, director of(
the Civic Forum of Baltimore, was j
chairman, urged abolishment of se
cret diplomacy."
With reference to the selective
draft and "conscientious objectors"
the report said:
"It is contrary to American lradi-
tion to force them to enrol! for war
service against their conscience." I
The report was referred by llie j
chairman. Rabbi .Tudah L. Mag:;e, to
the "executive committee." James'
II. laurer. president of th Pennsyl-1
vania State Federation of Labor. I
caused a stir when he demanded of j
'he conference "shall we accent war?" j
There was a chorus of "No" and i
sho shouts of "We wont fight" and I
"We wont go to Kurope."
Maurer said he had never been ar- j
rested in liis life, whereupon some I
one yelled "shame!"
Senator's Daupht'r Speaks.
Mrs. Rebecca Shelly, who also
spoke, urged the formation in this
eountry of a "people's council." to be
modeled nfter the council of woikmen
-u:d soldiers' delegates in Russia.
Mrs. Kola LaKo'lette. daughter of
the senator froii Wisconsin, who voted
a.-ainst the decimation or war. sub
mitted a report on perm-menl organ
ization. This in p;irt recommended 'hat 'I"
xeiiitive commission lie instructed
"to see to it tlvit leal defense of all

the bugle sounds, end the soldiers en
ter, driving the children before them.
They put on a very realistic charge,
and as the curtain descends for the
second part, a number of the boys are
seen to fall wounded. i
The curtain 'jn the next number rises ,
on a scene of quiet, and repose.
Nurses are running here and there, 1
bandaging the fallen, and the surgeon :
can be seen as he makes his rounds
of examination. The nurses give act
ual demonstrations of first aid treat
ment. At the close of this number the
Copper City four sings a number of
songs, which were vociferously receiv
ed last night by the audience. A
tableaux representing the "Glorifica
ti'on of the Red Cross" and the five
reel feature, "Somewhere in France,"
closed tne performance. The show
will be repeated tonight. The pro
ceeds of both nights will go to help
the Red Cross fund. The show was
staged by the local chapter of that or
ganization. An automobile parade
preceded the performance, which was
led by the C. & A. band. Many auto
ists were in line.
TJie sale of flowers, by small chil
dren, at the benefit amounted to $15.
The children passed down the aisles
of the theatre, and the lobby, offering
boquets for sale, and were well pat
ronized. BIG BLAST WILL GO
OFF PROMPTLY TODAY
AT 2:20ANN0UNCED
Ten Tons of Powder Will Be
Set OS On Sacramento Hill
This Afternoon. All Pre
caution Taken To Safeguard
. Life.
At 2:20 o'clock this afternoon, ten
tons of powder will be exploded in ten
drill holes on Sacramento Hill. This
was the definite Announcement made
yesterday by the engineering depart
ment of the Copper Queen.
In order to safeguard lives, during
the blasting, all employees of the com
pany and pt'jple who desire to see the
work, are cautioned to remain out of
the danger zone. They are urged to
remain west of the Holbrook or south j
of the Spray, Irish Mag and new nia-
chine shops. People are also warned
;to keep off Naco t'Jad at the time and
ihe people residing in that neighbor
hood have been asked to be out of
; their houses. It Is not anticipated that
any rocks be thrown on Naco Road
but some may be jarred ff the hill
and roll down on the north side ot &a- j
cramento. i
Undoubtedly, the blasting this aft-
ernoon will be epoch making in min-
ing circles in this region of the State
of Arizona. The holes to be set off
consist of ten churn drill Workings,
the deepest of which :s seventy-live
feet. A great mass of rock and dirt!
will be dislodged and the face of the
hill promises to assume an entirely
different aspect.

DOROTHY DALTON IN
'THE WEAKER SEX' AT
THE EAGLE THEATER
Star of "The Jungle Child"!
And "A Gamble In Souls" j
Is Wnining Recognition On
Screen.
Dorothy Dalton, seen in the most
prominent role in "The Weaker Sex,"
new Triangle drama, is the feature at
the Eagle today, newer stars rapidly
winning recognition by capable and
consistent work in each role allotted
her.
In "The Jungle Child," her charac
terization of the barbaric woman who
has no place in civilization and kills
with her bare hands the man who
dupes her. is remembered as tine of
the most noteworthy performances the
screen has seen. Another excellent
performance stands to her credit in "A
Gamble In Souls." where she makes
a man of a weakling with whom she
cast on a desert Island. An altogether
different role is hers fn "The Weaker
Sex" one dealing with woman's place
and possibilities in modern civiliza
tion, and it Is said to give her oppor
tunities of which she takes every ad
vantage. Charles Raij last seen previously
in "The Honorable Algy," has made
himself a favorite in many Triangle
productions, his best known role, per
haps, being that of "The Coward," in
the play of that name. Louise Gluam,
in "The Weaker Sex." adds another
unique characterization to her list of
"vampire" rtles.

'SEVEN DEADLY SINS'
AT THE LYRIC TODAY
In "Passion," one of the Seven
Deadly Sins, produced by McClure
Pictures, to be seen at the Lyric the
ater today, there is a wrestling match
between the villian and the "cham- j
pion." The villain Is urged on by Shir
ley Mason, the heroine.
In the end the villain wins.- It's so j
close, however, that one of the stagd j
hands at the McClure studios, when 1
he saw the picture first, picked thet'
"champion" to win. He still thinks
his man has a chance, and every time
he gets a chance to see "Passion"
the stage hand gets a bet down on
the "champ." He always has lost
so far. but the "champ" is getting
better every time the picture is run.

MALICIOUS RUMOR.
Wednesday the editorial rooms of the Review were
beseiged by visitors who wanted to know "whether tbe
Twenty Second Infantry had gone to the bottom with
an army transport." Not only did visitors ply this inter
rogation but the telephone operators were kept busy
making calls for the same purpose. On the face of it
the query was so false as to cause wonder that many
people would even credit it. On the other hand it
marbly discloses how dangerous such rumors can be
come. Every community, no matter how small or how large
are at various times the center of similar rumor. Many
times the brokers wires carry gossip that originates in
New York. " Often this news has been made on the east
ern markets for the sole purpose of depression of the
stocks or other commodities. When news comes over
the wires of the brokerage houses, however, it can, at
least, be nailed to an approximate origin.
Rumor which originates nowhere and travels every
where is frightful. The great majority of people do not
stop to question what they hear. The maxim; "believe
nothing of what you hear an little of what you see" does
not apply to stories built upon war possibilities. In other
words, the people like to be fooled.
There is another angle to such rumors, however, which
should receive attention. In most part they are, un
doubtedly, of an origin which is against the success of
the nation or country in which they are born. Some
ulterior and antagonistic purpose is behind their per
petration. In the "preliminary statement to the Press of
the United States,' issued by the Committee on Public
Information, this phaze of the censorship problem is com
mented upon. .
After writing of certain limitations which the Europ
ean censorship has brought upon itself and discussing the
problem in detail, the state says:
"A printed story is tangible even if false. It can be
denied. Its falsity can be proven. It is not nearly so
i
dangerous as false rumor. Tbe atmosphere created by
common knowledge that news is being suppressed is an
ideal "culture" for the propaganda of the bacteria of the
enemy rumors. The state of mind was the thing which
most impressed Americans visiting belligerent countries.
Insance and dangerous rumors, some of obvious enemy
origin, were readily believed, and they spread with
amariug rapidity. This is a greater danger than printing
scare stories. No one knows who starts a rumor, but !
there is a responsible editor behind every printed word."
Could the rumor in Bisbee have originated in the mind
cf an alien enemy? It is not beyond possibilty. 1
The example merely proves that the people are willing
to believe the worst. Here a caution is appropriate and
timely. The United States government will give to the
people of the country such news, if it is news. The gov- j
eminent will come into possession of such stories first.
The newspapers of the nation will be second in line and
the people will follow. The average rumor any rumor
can be scouted by the people until they see It in some
accredited newspaper or vouched for by some responsible
press service.
FAIR PLAY.
Americanism has come to mean, in the minds of nearly
everyone and internationally as well, fair play. As a
nation our hopes and our institutions have been builded
around that principle and when any organization, be it
one of capital, of labor, of learning of anything--does
not adhere to the rules of fairness, the supportnig senti
ment of a "square" people cease to approve. The house
of cards tumbles and somebody suffers. Such Is the
case at Jerome. Fair play is lacking iu tbe strike which
now holds in that camp.
"What are they striking for?" was the question a uuiou
mn not a miner asked on the streets of Bisbee yes
terday. He was told. He was told of the history of the
strike, of the granting of the Miami wage scale, of he
fair conditions holding at Jerome.
"It is hardly fair." was the observation of the man.
"At such a time a$ this to brow-bpat an employer. Some
men may think that they have the companies in a holt;.
They may imagine that they will gain, at this time, what
they are striving for. I am inclined to think differeutly.
I believe in unionism hut at the present instant I am
buying 1100 worth of Liberty Bonds and I don't think
I would participate iu any disturbance which might effect
the nation. From another aspect the average union man
will frown upoa suea strikes; publie sentiment is lacking
in the men's favor. And public sentiment is tbe only
weapon we have. It must be on our side to win anything.
The Jerome strikers are outside the pale of it."
Undoubtedly, many if not all of the working men of
the state union or otherwise feel the same about the
Jerome situation as the union man quoted, heretofore.
The average man values, and appreciates fair play more
than anyone else. He but needs to see wherein he is not
fair to take a different view of the situation. This of
course is not so of the professional malcontent, whose
tenure of office depends upon his ability to stir up
trouble.
The United States is at war. President Wilson can
not be accused of catering to capital. Secretary Wilson
has avowedly declared himself in favor of labor. Yet
both of these men, supported by no less a person than
Samuel Gompers, president of the American Federation
of Labor, have asked that all labor and capital confine
its attentions to the business at hand the successful
prosecution of the war with the Imperial German Government
Some people may think that a strike in any one of
the large copper camps is of small concern to the gov
ernment. They are mistaken. The smallest cog, in the
greatest machine, may have a sickening and killing effect
on its efficiency.
The Jerome strikers, or those who have fooled them
and led them into this trouble, are pot playing fair. They
are taking advantage, not so much of the employers, but
of the country. They are participating in a disturbance
which might, in the end, mean something much worse
than, non-recognition of any union autocracy.
Let's get right and inject a little more fair play into
the situation. It is the only thing that will save it.
"WHITHER ARE WE DRIFTING."
Washington, D. C July 25, 1917 (Special) By execu
tive order today President Wilson closed all the distil
leries and breweries in the United States, under the au
thority given him by congress to prevent the use of
grain or other foodstuffs In the manufacture of alcoholic
liquors.
Washington, P. C, July 30. 1917. (Special.) President
Wilson closed the New York stock exchange today by
telegraphic order for an indefinite period. He acted in
accordance with tbe provisions of the act passed late in
June by congress.
Washington, D. C, Aug. 1, 1917. (Special.) Acting
under tbe direction of the president. Food Dictator
Hoover today bought 20.000,000 bushels of wheat, paying
for them with a treasury warrant for $30,000,000, the
sum of $1.50 a bushel having been fixed as the maximum
price for wheat during the current month. 4
Washington, D. C, Aug. 5. 1917. (Special.) Govern
ment agents were ordered today to take immediate pos
session of tbe five largest coal mines in Illinois. They
will be operated for the period of the war under govern
ment control because their owners did not promptly obey
orders sent them by the administration.
The Tribune does not print the above purely imaginary
dispatches because it thinks they are ever likely to be
sent. But with all the economic and social machinery of
the United States government in process of revolution
with little but the incredible and impossible happening
nil over the world there is no use denying the possibil
ity that they may be sent. Certainly if congress grants
to President Wilson the authority for which he is asking
It wouId be well within his power to issue just 6uch orders
as are imagined above, to say nothing of even more radi
cal and revolutionary orders, which the lay imagination,
not yet inflamed by active participation in the world war.
is not able to formulate or even to conceive.
At any rate The Tribune, fabricating concrete orders
which would be possible under the grant asked by Presi
dent Wilson, thinks it wise to print them now, because
if they ever should be issued it might be then forbidden
to print them under the censorship law, which is also
part of the presidential demands.
Emphasizing the fact that its dispatches from Washing
ton are purely fictional. The Tribune hopes they may
help that part of the public which reads them to realize
how complete is the vote of confidence which congress
is urged" to pass in the unerring judgment and profound
wisdom of a single man.
Even in Great Britain, whose practice we are asked to
copy, the supreme authority is 16dged. not in an individ
ual, but in a war council or committee In the delibera
tions of which a majority vote is presumably dec isive.
The Tribune does not quarrel with the plan of central
izing authority. One cannot depend on the slow processes
of legislative bodies for the prompt decisions which are
necessary in time of war. The unquestioned "yea" and
"nay" of a single voice are without doubt essential when
a great democratic nation has determined to enforce
its will upon a foreign foe.
Tbe Tribune does not feel itself wise enough to declare
that eventually, at least all the features of the presi
dential program way not prove necessary to national se
curity and victory. It contents itself, for the present, with
pointing out that the only thinking man in the United
States who is not terrified by the magnitude of the powrr
demanded by President Wilson appears to be the presi
dent himself. Chicago Tribune.

WAR
A state of virtual inaction prevails
on all the war fronts. In only une
theater has there been any fighting
worthy of note. This was in the
Champagne region of France, where
the French, counter-attacking heavily
against positions northeast of Mont
Haut, where Wednesday night the
Germans in a violent offensive raid
captured trench elements, drove out
the Teutons Thursday and re-established
their former front in its en
tirety. To the west, in the region lying be
tween Soissons and Rheims, there has
been a continuation of the spirited
artillery of various sectors, namely,
Vauxillon, Laffaux. and south of
Berry-Au-Bac, the Germans, for the
first time in several months, carried
out sapping operations. This netted
them portions of trenches, which were
blown up.
The intensive fighting along the
southern portion of the Austro-Ger-tnan
front his entirely ceased, the
Italians probably being engaged in
-onsolidating ground won and in
bringing up their guns for further op
erations in their campaign against
Trieste. Along the Isonzo line only
artillery duels have been in progress
owing to bad weather conditions.
There has been a renewal of activ-j
ity by the Italians in Albania and sev- j
tral villages in the southern parts of
his theater have been taken and held
successfully auainst counter-attacks
-ft the Teutonic 'allies. Eastward, on
'he entire Macedonian front, artillery
duels are in progress.

(By Review Leased Wire).
From a Staff Correxpondent of the
Associated Press With the British
Armies in France. Via I-ondon. May
31." While comparative quiet con
tinues to reign along most of the west
ern front, the war is far from stand
ing still. That great machine behind
the fighting forces continues to move
with never-resting energy.
Artillery- duels break out by day
and by night along the various sectors
of the long baitle line and there
passes now unnoticed an expenditure
of shells which, two years ago. would
have been regarded as little short of
marvelous. But the game of modern
warfare is ever a progressive one.
and the miracle of today becomes the
commonplace of tomorrow.
The Infantry activity lately has
been confined wholly to raids and
minor local attacks. - These are con
ducted .nainly for the purpose of
keeping in touch with the enemy's
movements and intentions. Both the
British and I'ermans adopted tbese
tactics and the few hours of darkness
later are filled with trench maraud
ing expeditions.
The Germans appear daily to grow
more nervous and worried by the
present lull. They are watching the
British with cat-like alertness . The
slightest alarm during the r.U'ht. sets
their guns going and many defensive
barrage ' curtains have been thrown
uselessly in front of British positions.
Some of their airplanes also are tak
ing desperate chances in flying low
over the line, endeavoring to keep in
touch with any Important movement.
The German government continues
to fill the air with wireless propagan
da against the British, virtually ignor
ing all the other allies, including the
United States. The trench version
in the Arras district of Emperor Wil
liam's recent speech was to the effect
that no British prisoners should be
taken; that the Germans should hate
j:11 the English, and If they could not
avoid taking some prisoners they
were to treat them with the greatest
severity. Emperor William was at
Douai and at Tournai, May 23, and
made speeches at both places.
TAG DAY TUESDAY
The local chapter of the Red Cross
will celebrate Tag Day, which it has
decided to hold on Registration Day,
June 5th. Ladies of the Red Cross
costumed as nurses will be on the
streets, selling the tags for 10 cents
each. Quite a sum is expected to be
realized, which will go to swell the
fund of the local chapter.
