ITALIAN ARMY HEADQUARTERS
IN NORTHERN ITALY, Wednesday,
Dec. 5. (By the Associated Press)
The furious enemy attack on vhe
Asiago plateau has been repulsed with
heavy losses, except at the northeast-
wher aftosJeJ.piate stwrgle which
lasted until this morning, the enemy
succeeded in occupying some of the
I advanced Italian lines, which were re
tired to more secure positions. The
main attack on the Italian riht was
contested thirty-six hours.
The attacks reached the maximum
of intensity toward 4 o'clock yester
day afternoon. They came from two
directions, the first on the left of the
Italian line around Meletta heights,
and then on the right around M'onte
Tonderecar.
The first assault on the left was met
bv strong artillery fire which mowed
heavy losses and the cap.ur
ure of a
number of. groups of prisoners. To
ward 5 o'clock the infantry rushes
were definitely repulsed and the en-
emy's action on the left became a ""l
len bombardment with heavy and mid
dle calibre guns.
At the same time the main action
shifted fj the Italian right with an in
tense shelling which lasted for five
hours. This was followed by the
loosing of gas and by infantry attacks
in force near Monte Tonderecar. Here
the fighting was sanguinary both in
attack and counter attack .
The Italian first army, which is
meeting the brunt of the attack, is
again giving splendid evidence of its
offensive and defensive qualities.
The spirit of the men is high and
the general commanding the first
army has gone along the front line,
saw his men in the field and trenches
and personally congratulated them on
their valor.

As a tesult of the backward move-

occupation of Graincourt Anneux,
Noyelles and the woods and heights
north of Mareoing, and that their un
contested gain has been to a depth
of about two and a half miles over a
front of six and a quarter miles. The

region began British prisoners in ex
cess of 9000 and 114 guns have been
taken.
On the Italian front, the Austro

nightfall that 25 of the injured had

Many Seriously Injured j
Those , who were onljr slightly in-i
jured were sent to their own homes j
or to those o friends after their;
wounds had been treated. There were:
scores of cases of serious injury j
however, and it is expected the death'
list w iO be greatly increased by those J
who succumb to their wounds. Auto-;

sections of the city tonight carrying
blanket-clad burdens. j
A committee of citizens already has'
been formed and assistance is asked ;
from a!l outside- points. j
Explosion Felt 75 Miles Away
T'ne supplies most needed are glass,:
beaver board, putty, bedding and
blankets. The mayors in all towns of
the province have been asked to rush
supplies to Halifax. The force of the'
explosion was felt at Truro, 75 miles
away, where windows were shattered. :
All telegraph and telephone wires
were torn down and for several hours
Halifax was completely isolated from '
the outside world. !
The concussion shattered the bigj
gas tanks of the city. All power plants
are out of commission, and newspaper
offices have been so hadlv wrecked '
that publication is Impossible. j

Worse Than Flanders
Col. Mackenzie Bell, who spent two
years on the firing line in Flanders,
said tonight he never had seen any
thing on the battle front to equal the
scenes of destruction he witnessed In
Halifax today.
It was reported tonight that all the
guests in the hotels of the city are
safe. Some of them were cut by fly

raise Halifax were ineffectual. An
hour later it was learned that the op
erator who had been sending from the
stricken city had left his key when a
messenger brought him news that his
wife had been dangerously Injured.
While sending the story he had ex
pressed the-fear that something must
have happened to her because she had
sent him no word since be went on

The regular Canadian Press 'opera
tor at Halifax has been missing since
the explosion and his place was taken
bv a substitute. Sending of fur:her
details of the disaster was perforce
suspended until a second substitute
was found.
Washington. Dec. 6. Aid for the
6tricken city of Halifax was started '.
forward tonight by the American Kea
Cross. On a special train sent from :
Bos:on by the governor of Massachu-
setts were six experienced oiasier re
lief workers, with quantities of surgi
cal supplies, bedding and clothing and
a special Red Cross train from New
York carried food, mattresses, blank-
eis, sweaters, overcoats and a large
quantity of clothing for w'jmen and
children.
City Is Dark
The city was in darkness tonight,
except k'jt the flames from the tires
still burning in the wrecked buildings
in the north end. The electric light
and gas plants have been virtually de
stroyed and the only ligh:s available
are kerosene lamps. They furnished
the illumination by means of which
the surgeons and tioctors toiled hero
ically throughout' the night caring for
the injured'.
SoldieVs. sailors and police patrolled
the streets tonight and upon them fell
the mayor part of the burden of search
ing among ruins for the dead and
wounded. The Canadians were assist
ed in this work by sailors from an
American warship in the harbor.
Approximately Two Miles Burneo
The flameswept area covers approx
imately two and one half square miles.
It begins at what is known as the
North street bridge, extending north
to Pier 8 on the Richmond wa:erfront
and back t'j a point running parallel
with Gottingen street. Nothing has
been left standing in this section ot
the city. Only a pile of smouldering
ruins marks the spot where the great
building of the American Sugar Re
fining company stood. The drydock
and all the buildings which sur
rounded it were .destroyed. The
Richmond school that h'jused hun
dreds of children, was demolished and
it is reported only three escaped.
Canadian officers who have seen
long service in France characterize
the catastrophe as the "most fearful
which has befallen any city in the
world!"
RELIEF IS SENT

Call, left DoeX,a for Halifax at 10:17
o'clock tonight. On board were 11

It Pays to
Buy the Best
But every housewife should remem
ber that the best is rot aways the highest
priced. Experience has taught me that you can't always
judge quality by the cost sign.
That is particularly true of baking
powder. Baking powder quality can be de
termined only by bake day results. The baking powder that
urvtt you best -regardless of what you pay is the best to
buy and use.
I have made a cl jsq study and care
ful investigation of bal ing powder, because it
is unquestionably one of the most important of baking ma
terials. It effects all ingredients employed w.ith it.
No woman, no matter how careful
her selection of flour, sugar, eggs, etc., can
employ the limit of baking economy if she uses a poorly
made, wasteful baking powder.
Merit, not money, is the only safe
basis upon which to cotimate the worth of a
baking powder. Fortunately ihe housewife no longer has to
conduct costly experiments of he r own to determine just which
particular brand is the moit effr ier.t and economical. Experts
like myself, make a business f testing baking powders and
accurately arriving nt their actual v- uc. Wa tr.zhe no mistakes in our
decisions as our experiments iro iu-ue iJonj strictly scientific lines.
Millions cf women are now profit
ing by the aid offered by domestic scientists.
I know this to be true as choice is now centered on the
brand of baking powder thst I ai. J other domestic scientists have
found superior through both chemical and oven tests. It is
becoming more popular every day. Its tremendous sales
increase was not influenced in th; least by cost It is a moderate
priced baking powder. Costs considerably less than some other
brands. till it is preferred by wor-cn who could and would pay more
were it possible to secure the desii . I quality. They don't buy this
brand of baking powder beccuss 'fa saving of cost -r but because
of its demonttrated superiority. To them it means the rrratest
quality value the greatest parity nd greatest certainty of results
that can be had at any price. Decidedly the best, not because
of moderate price, but because of its unimprovable merit.
In justice to thc'c who read this
article that may si iarc in the savings tnd
baking success assured by the I iggest selling and recognized
superior baking powder it is no tr.r re than fair that I give publicity
to the brand preferr.J alike bv r- pert and America's millions of

NEW YORK STOCKS
NEW YORK. Dec. 6. Untoward de
velopments, notably the reported en
tente reversals In France and Italy,
the Halifax disaster and suggestions
of additional pr'ce revision of impor
tant commodities, prompted moderate j
realizing for profits and some short'
ielling in today's stock market.
The recommendations contained in
the majority report of the interstate
commerce commission imparted irreg
ular strength to the list at the open
ing, but by midday virtually all initial
advances were replaced by extreme
recessions of 2 to 3 points.
Retention of the regular dividends
by the principal metal-produeipgcom
panies, instead of expected reduc
tions. Induced tentative buying and
short covering in the latter part of
the session,, but the market closed
sluggish with a preponderance of net
losses.
United States Steel closed at 87,
almost Its lowest quotation of the
day, and a 2 point setback. Other in'
dustrials made similar concessions.
Karly gains of 1 to 2 points in minor
rails were materially reduced. Utili-
ties were under constant pressure,
losing 1 to 2 points. Sales amounted
to 465,000. shares.
Strength of Spanish exchange and
heaviness in remittances on Rome
were the contrasting features of the
foreign exchange market. Domestic
monetary conditions were' unaltered.
Bonds, including international is
sues, were heavy. Liberty 4's varied
from 97.1S to 97.42 and the 3'i's from
9S.34 to 98.94. Total sales, par value
$4,463,000. United States bonds, old
issues, were unchanged on call.

owners of Bisbee and Douglas that
were trying to slip the bond issue over
because they wanted the paved road
from Bisbee to Douglas, but the re
turns show that they were mistaken
and that the mass of citizens through
the county wanted the bond issue to
carry. Taking out the Votes of Bisbee,
Warren, Don Luis, Douglas and Pir

the issue would then have carried by
a vote of 622 to 465. In order that the

Avoiding the Rush Hours
The curve in the right-hand corner of the illustration shows approximately th
fluctuations of telephone calls at a large central office in a business section of a
city. The high spots represent the rush hours for which additional operator? and
adequate equipment must always be ready.
To get easier hauls, the railroad engineer lowers grades and straightens curves,
cutting through hills and filling valleys.
If the telephone traffic curve could be flattened by distributing a percentage j
of calls over less busy periods, it would effect a material Baring and assist us
to meet the extraordinary demands for telephone service.
Important business calls cannot be deferred, but there are many calls, social
and less urgent, which might be made at other times without loss to the sub
scriber. By avoiding these high spots in telephone traffic, and by making telephone calls
of a social or lsss urgent nature before or after the rush hours, the telephone
user will be cooperating with us in the patriotic service we are rendering the
Government and help us to meet the constantly increasing demands fox telephone

Friday Morning, December 7, 1917.
Bisbee disproved that time-worn statement that a po
phet is without' honor in his own country when she
honored Sheriff Wheeler Wednesday night.
General Von Lndendorff of the German staff is quoted
as declaring that "the war will not end in a draw." He
must have had advance information upon President Wil
son's message-, read Tuesday in congress.
- Ney asked Napoleon for infantry at a critical period
of the battle of Waterloo. "Infantry," replied the greatest
captain of all wars, "do-s the man suppose I can make
infantry? But the Germans seem to be able to make in
fantry. In the face of three years of the most stupendous
losses they are able to hold their long front secure and
then mass troops and guns at Cambrai in overwhelming
numbers. Either General Byng will have to hitch up his
trousers and. tighten his belt and spit on his hands and
cut loose with all his steam, or the intense Bisbee rooter
for the allied cause will -spend an unhappy Christmas.
After sfx carloads of perfectely good potatoes had
stood for a week on a sidetrack in Cleveland the city
seized them and sold them at ninety-five cents per bushel.
How much grain and vegetables and fruit have been at- j
lowed to rot jn warehouses and ships and cars during
the past two years of high prices, only the Lord knows.
Those individuals and companies that buy food in such
vast quantities that they cannot properly handle and dis
pose of it while it is still in good condition, ought to be
sent to jail without bond and then tried before a jury
of wage earners who are paying triple prices for the
necessities of life.
The Halifax disaster emphasizes the constant nienacf
of transportation during the war. Ships and tars loaded
to capacity with high explosives are moving in a ftream
day and night under hurry np orders. That there are not
more accidents of thrs.kind is the wonder of it all. Trans
portation of troops and explosives to and from all parts
of the world during the past three years, with the U-boats
doing their worst, has been attended with remarkably
small loss of life and property when the hazard is con
sidered. All docks and harbors are crowded and all en
trances are mined. These times are about as perilous
as those seen in the vision of John at Patmos, when the
angel opened the seven vials of wrath upon the world.
Reports from the Cambrai sector continue to get
worse and worse. The London offioe practically admits
that it cannot hold the Germans back. This is the most
disconcerting news of the war. If the British war ma
chine that was good enouih to smash the Hindenburg line
. and hold all gains through two summers, has now gone
to smash, then the worst is yet to come. The allies have
a vast superiorty of men and guns on the western front
or did have them. Why they cannot hold the ground won
and foi-e the fighting in the open to advantage by a
much greater concentration at this point than the Huns
is past the comprehension of tliif amateur war critic to
fathom. Not for two years have the Germans showed
uch hitting power as they have in the past few weeks
in Italy and at Cambrai. The oft spoken of German
morale seems to have gotten its second wind.
Any Bisbee citizen who is inrlined to kick upon the
pri'e of twenty dollars a ton for coal, might read the fol
lowing from the Washington, D. ('., Times, and then
wonder if this district is getting very much the worst
of it after all: "It took more than twenty dollars and a
pleading voice to buy a ton of coal in Wa&liington yester
day. This was proven by a deputation of Times reporters,
caeli armed with a twenty-dollar gold piece and an im
pending chill and each instructed to use every kind of a
plea he could think of to get one tou of coal delivered
at his home. One hundred and one coal dealers were
isited and as a last resort every government official
having anything to do with the fuel question was appealed
to. The result bummed up is I hat there were several
oc.iers who said that possibly Uiey might deliver a tots
some time not week, but would make no promises:
from all the rest the answer was, "Sorry, but can't bell
you a ton today." "
HERTLING'S CHALLENGE.
(Kansas City Star.)
There Is a challenge to the allies as well as to the
German people in Chancellor Von Hertling's review of the
war. He points to the Cerman military successes and
virtually admonishes the central powers to hold on un
til the war map can be converted into the peace map.
A comparison of German and allied resources shows
that a time must come wnen Germany's strength will be
waning while that of the allies will still be climbing.
There are indications that that time Is neat, if not al
ready arrived. If in three years of effort, in which her
maximum strength has been used, Germany has not been
able to cash in, what chance will she have to do it when
her strength begins to decline?
Under these cireimstnnces, if Germany had the nerve
to hold out while the allies' nerve failed, and they were
ready to accept a Lansdowne peace, then Germany would
deserve to win and impose her rule on the rest of the
world.
The wheatless day has been changed from Friday to

S. P. Applewhite of Douglas has re

who is now in France, engaged in Red

which gives an idea of the pi'jblems
with which Mr. Douglas is confronted.
Following are some excerpts from the
letter:

of tbe Bowie Enterprise and the the Enterprise is just a
small country weekly but in its opposition to the bond
issue it was as earnest as a buzz saw and as eloquent as
Billy Sunday In a sin cursed town. It was also misguid

particular narrative of events. The point is that the En

Bowie editor whetted his old goosequill pen until it was
sharper than the famou? knife of the man after whom
his town was named. He set his deadlines in sixty point
and strung them across his pages like banners in the
breeze of battle. He viewed with alarm and he viewed
with scorn and he viewed with Berserk rage. He argued,
pleaded, cajoled, threatened, exposed and exclaimed. He
fought to the last ditch against the bonds, and kept on
fighting. The bonds carried, it is true, and by an over
whelming majority. But in Bowie, the home of this edi
tor man, every single vote- was cast in a solid block
against the bonds. There were ninety-five votes counted

It i impossible to conceive the amount of work that is
being done in this country to win the war. Here ?s a
little clift in the mountains,' that torty years ago was in
habited only by wolves and Apache Indians. And yet
hundreds of young men have gone from hero to encamp
ments to train for the wai game. Scores of young men
enlisted from here beforj the draft to fight in the engin
eers, the artillery, the signal corps and the marines.
Business men have gone from here to France to aid in
Red Cross work. Our county officials are most of them
spending as much time on war work as county work. Our
women, young and old, are working every day for a dozen
war funds and benefactions. We have given millions
to carry on the war. This all seems a great deal. But
consider that every community in the republic is doing
the same thing. The aid and rich cities back cast have
thousands engaged iu this work where we have scores.
Their streams of wealth is a river compared to our rivu
let. And every country hamlet adds a raindrop and a
rill. The saving and the giving and the doing for the.
war has grown ami grown until now it absorbs the ener
gies of one hundred millions of people. The volume of
steel and gold and gunpowder we will throw into the
scales next year will he past conception and belief. The
work here is identical with thousands of towns and cities,
added up into one stupendous whole and it would make
a volcano of energy sevui like a parlor uiat h and a

PHOENTX. Dec. 6. Resentiug the
report of Postmaster General Burle
son in opposition to the organization
of postal employees into unions, the
following pretest was telegraphed to.
President Wilson tonight:
"Speaking for the organized work-:
ers in Arizona, including postal em-
ployees, we most earnestly protest
against the unwise and unfair insult
to organized labor contained in the
postmaster general's report. Mr.
President, you know the advisability
of having at the head of the postal
service, employing such a large num
ber of men and women, an executive
who knows and understands the prob
lems of men and women who labor
for a living. The retention of Burle
son as postmaster general would be
detrimental to the service and unjust
to tbe employees.
