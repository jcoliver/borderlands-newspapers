EL PASO. May 4. Villa followers,
Cientifico leaders and Legalistas are
believed by government agents bere
to be planning to launch a new revo
lutionary movement against the es
tablished government of Mexico with
Villa as the military leader and Mig
tiel Diaz Lombardo as the provisional
president. This movement is expect
ed to be started within the next week
and is the cause of a number of for
mer Villa leaders, Cientifico advisors
and other expatriated Mexicans com
ing to this pclnt on the border at this
time.
Lombardo as Leader
The tentative plan, as near as Un
ited States secret service agents have
been able to learn, is to have Villa
proclaim his revolution against the
government, declare himself as the
military commander and Lombardo as
the head and fix a point near the bor
""iler where "the provisional capital will
be established.
Guadalupe a Capital
Guadalupe, 30 miles southeast of
Juarez, is said to have been selected
as the provisional capital and Villa is
reported to be at the Calderon ranch,
forty-five miles south of Guadalupe,
with bis command awaiting the arriv
al of Diaz Lombardo before taking
possession of this Mexican town
which is opposite Fabens, Texas. Vil
la is also said to have a large quanti
ty cf gold and silver bullion which he
has arranged to exchange for ammu
nition. ' Americans Involved
Americans are said by Mexican se
cret service agents to be playing a
financial part in the reorganized Villa
movement. Two well known Ameri
cans left here today for Guadalupe
and were said to be going for a con
ference with Villa's representatives
at the border. Letters addressed to
former Villa leaders in El Paso, In
viting them to Join Villa near Guada
lupe, have been obtained by the Mex
ican secret service agents. These
letters were signed by Jose Ynez Sal
azar, the commander of the Villa
band which has been operating along
the Rio Grande opposite Fort Han
cock, Fabens and Sierra Blanca.

PEACE WITHOUT
ANNEXATiGH
IS CRY IN
Hollweg's Silence On Peace
Prompted By Desire To
Avert Internal War Over
Disputed Terms.
r
(By Review Leased Wire)
COPENHAGEN, via L'jnuon, May 4.
The silence of German Imperial
Chancellor von Bethmann-Hollweg,
concerning Germany's peace terms, if,
as declared, it is based on a desire
to avoid disrupting the unity of feel
ing in the country by discussion of
contentious questions and not as some
uncharitable German critics assert
upon the absence of a definite (,'jvern
ment peace policy, has failed of its
object An acrimonious controversy
Is now raging in Germany between
the big annexationists, the little an
nexationists and the advocates of no
annexations and indemnities whatever.
. ... Clash With Socialists
The Pan-German League has sent
circulars to its branches throughout
the country asking them to organize
meetings everywhere in the interests
of "German peace" and against the
Socialistic peace program. The con
servatives have introduced an interpel
lation in the reichstag in an endeavor
to smoke out von Bethmann-Hollweg
and force him to declare himself for
or against the Schiedmann program.
The Radicals have introduced a sim
ilar interpellation in the Prussian
Diet
The revival of the activity of the
imperialistic organizations of agricul
ture and industry, who were respou
sible for the famous suppressed circul
ar of the six leagues with a sweep
ing annexationist program in 1915 is
marked by the issue of a stiffly ward
ed pronunciamento for a long lis
religious organizations. The Pan-Am
erican league and the army and navy
groups are demanding peace with in
demnities, increased territories and
greater power for Germany.
Socialists Want Nothing
The Socialists' meetings, on the
other hand, are making and strength
ening public opinfon for a peaee with
no indemnities and no annexation. Tlii,
Socialist leaders obviously are endeav
oring to sweep the government and
the Imperial chancellor into a declar
ation of their peace aims on similar
lines and which could be used at the
Stockholm conference.
The moderate elements who favor
taking what can be gotten are assail
ing von Bethmann-Hollweg for weak
kneed shrinking from trouble, and de
mand in resolutions adopted by the
Liberal party and in the editorials of
such papers as the Vosslsche Zeitung
that the chancellor now make a clear
and definite statement of policy as a
step toward inner and outer peace.

Craconne is at the eastern end of
the Vauclerc plateau, the scene of
much desperate fighting recently, and
its possession by the Germans placed
a salient in the French line parallel

of Irish birth or descent refused to
receive a resolution calling upon
President Wilson and congress to in

In the rejection of more than thirty
persons from the hall and which was
not quelled until 200 policemen made
free use of their clubs.
The trouble began at the close of
speech by former U. S. Senator
James F. O'Gorman, when Richard F.
Dalton, a young Long Island lawyer,
arose and addressed the chair.
I have listened with attention to
what has been said by the previous
speakers," Dalton cried, "but I have
heard no word said about home rule.?
Then he drew a typewritten paper
from bis pocket.
"You cannot read that." declared
Chief Magistrate Wm. McAdoo, the
chairman, but 'he young man was
persistent and had started to read Ms
resolution when he was seized by two
detectives bodily and carried to the
nearest exit.
Instantly cries of "free speech."
"gag rule," "we want home ru'e " and
"down with England" came from all
parts of the hall.
These shouts werj drowned out
with clan calls and the entire audi

Flags of the Irish Republic were
waved by hundreds In the audience.

increased. Chairman McAdoo was un
able to make himself heard although
he shattered the desk in front of him

building than It broke out afresh in
some other section of the hall. Not
until the reserves arrived did they re

Savior of Belgium Says Hous

What Dictating of Food Is
Needed In America.
(By Review Leased Wire).
WASHINGTON, Mey 4. Herbert C.
Hoover, recently named chairman of
the food commission "of the council of
national defense, arrived here today
to advise the government on fcod con
ditions abroad and on measures the
allied governments have taken to con
serve their food supplies.
"I have been called a food dictator,"
said Mr. Hoover tonight, "but that Is
incorrect. What I am here i'jr is to
give my services to the nation in an
way I can be of use. Secretary Hous
ton will control the country's food
supply under bills pending in congress
and I will assist him and the council
of defense by supplying information
gathered in relief work abroad."
Mr. Hoover said he could make no
statement concerning the food situa
tion in Europe until he bad made his
report to President Wilson.
"his report," he said, "will indicate,
the requirements of the allied coun
tries, their capacity to produce aim
the amount of food the United States
will have to supply. I will 'outline
steps the allies are taking to reduce
consumption and bow they are malt

do not know what the government will
require of me. I am acting in an uu
official capacity and no plans have

be appointed in the near future and
the army bill provides that the Pres

source.
The full strength of the national

regular and national guard force to

Margarita Fischer, star of "The
Devil's Assistant," which appears to
day at the Orpheum theatre, was born
in a small town in the middle west and
the coming of a traveling dramatic
company to this fjwn was the turning
point in her career. Needing a child
in their production they persuaded her
parents to allowi Margarita Fischer to
play with them. Her talent was sc
unmistakable that her father organiz
ed a company and starred her r
"Babe Fischer."
At the age of fourteen Miss Fischei
leaped from juvenile into leading par.;
in her father's stock company ani be
acme known as Margaita Fir
At her father's death Miss Fischer
signed with Walter Saaford. Othci
iDi'jminent managers with whom --r
toured were T. Daniel Frawley and
Joseph Medill Patterson. A season
with Grace George followed and then
Miss Fischer went into vaudeville, met
Harry Pollard and they -started on a
vaudeville tour together.
Motion pictures then lured her and
Miss Fischer joined first with Selig,
thence to American in the Beauty
Films in which she played opposite
Harry Pollard. A shvrt time she ap-
jpeared with the Equitable and then the
Pollard Pictures Plays Company was
formed with Harry Pollard as director
and Margarita Fischer as star.
All this experience has a cash value
to the exhibitor. Miss Fischer is one of
the best known of American actresses.
This is evidenced by her mail of about
seven hundred letters a day.

a resolution adopted yesterday by the

order placing him in possession of

A stay of execution on this judge

HYSTERICAL ECONOMY.
Bisbee merchants are feeling the first pangs of the
wave of hysterical economy which appears to be pervad
ing the country, In the wake of the declaration of a state
of war and its attendant activities. While a strict econ
omy in waste energy and, particularly. In the matter of
foodstufTs is essential to the success of the United States
and its allies, hysteria should be ruled into oblivion.
Nothing, so much as a continuation of sound and unim
paired business conditions will aid the country, as a
whole, in its present need.
Food is a product which is essential to the very life
of the United States and the other countries at war.
Food must be conserved. Various agencies in the coun
try are at work upon plans which have as their object
the Increasing of the supply in this nation. A potato or
a bushel of wbeat can be used only once. It must be
made to go as far as possible; hence the universal de
mand that the great mass of the people economize. It
is good business to economize in this department of the
nation's resources.
In the matter of a great many other products, however,
the economy propaganda is becoming hysterical. In Bis
bee, atone, the retail merchants selling dry goods and
similar 'articles, are noticing the slight let-up in the
demand for goods. It Is right and proper that the people
of this city should economize, in all lines. It Is not right,
however, that economy should be changed to an hysteria
which wftl result in an infinite crippling of the coun
try's productive industries.
War, if it acts upon the United States as it has upon
' England, will create a wonderful demand for nearly every
conceivable article of merchandise. There is no reason
why thepresent conflict should act in any other way in
the United States.
If the 'country's merchants are crippled, if general
business is reduced to a point where it is no longer pro
ductive then a condition of affairs will be apparent in the
nation which will retard a successful persecution of the
great undertaking at hand the" elimination of the Prus
sian autocracy.
If, on the other hand, the people of the Warren district
end those of every other community, follow sensible lines
of economy and do not give way to hysteria, then there
can only be one resulting victory, economically, as well
as on the battlefields and on the seas.
A PATRIOTIC SAVING.
All of the Banks of the Warren District have received
telegrams from Secretary of the Treasury, William A
McAdoo, asking that they co-operate with the Federal
Reserve system in subscribing for the $2,000,000,000
loan for the United States and her allies. This loan will
undoubtedly receive the instantaneous support of all of
the people and those in the Warren District should do
their part.
The Bank of Bisbee, in an effort to aid the Bisbee sub
scription to the loan, wilL allow interest on all savings
accounts, computed to the last month. It is the practice
of local banks to allow and compute interest on such ac
counts at the end of each six months period. In this
manner thousands of dollars, now in savings accounts',
will go into the big loan.
Every man, woman and child should have a bond. No
matter how small or how great, such a possession will
at once brand the possessor as an actual contributor, in
dollars and cents, to the country's need. In addition the
security is the best in the world the good will and the
credit of the people of the United States.

THE EAGLE HAS ITS WINGS.
Congress lias done a patriotic and unselfish thing. The
American political organization. Justly scolded as it most
times must be, will arise and justify the faith which the
republic has in democracy, says the Chicago Tribune.
Congress has given the nation a system by which a
powerful and democratic army can be built. When the
selective draft bill was passed the nation could stand
uncovered and sing: "Mine eyes have seen the coming of
the glory of the Lord."
We stand -upon stone now and not upon sands. Wb
have a weapon in our hands, not a reed. Congress has
hit Germany a harder blow than auy that could le de
livered iu France or Flanders just now. It has provided
the reserve for Germany's enemies, and that reserve is to
ie built up by good, not bad, methods.
The world is nearer peace for this. A nation of 100,
000,000 is organizing itself ccolly and not by hysteria,
by science and not by emotions, to do its part. It is fresh,
strong, unscarred, and untouched. It will become deter
mined and will be courageous.
Germany is a nation cn a rock with the tides rising.
When it is in doubt whether tide or nation would pre
vail, a bigger wave, an irresistible wave, forms on the
horizon, and the nation on the rock is gone.
If congress had been weak and emotional, if it had
yielded to prejudice, fear, and ignorance; if it had made

Germany would have been heartened
that American material can make the finest soldiers in
the world if American methods will be selected for thf
purpose. The wealth, in men and money of the country
is virtually inexhaustible. It cannot be exhausted within
ordinary prospect if it be wisely used and wisely con
served. Congress has been a wise conservator.
Now that congress has acted "wisely and unselfishly,
the administrative authorities to whom such vast powers
have been given must act wisely and unselfishly.
Congress could have retained its harmful civilian hand
But Germans know duction to "J. E. T." Those three init

Mr. Thompson and party arrived in
Bisbee last evening. He has been
touring the entire state of Arizona
and particularly in the various min
ing camps. Mr. Thompson is no

upon the management of the army which it has created.! '
A civilian hand upon army control means baneful in
fluence and waste of lives. It is important for a con
gressman to obtain good army appointments for the in
competents of his district. It is deadly for the army when
i
such appointments are made.
Congress has surrendered the mischevious privileges
which it might have retained, and no word of praise can
be strong enough to give credit to the men who did this,
and no word of caution can be effective enough to suffi
ciently advise the authorities to whom these vast powers
have been surrendered.
This, it must be understood, is a democratic army. It
will be composed of men taken by the selective draft from
all sorts and conditions of life. They are to do a servlcs
to the nation, not a service to their superiors in rank.
They are to be selected for fitness, and they will submit
to discipline, but any army officer who thinks that these
citizens of the republic need a touch of social rigors to
be subordinated to a proper place in efficient army econ
omy is a worse fool than the congressman who voted
against conscription.
These men are citizens under an officer. The officer
must be an officer because he knows more of military
affairs than the men under him. . He will be respected up
on that basis. It is' the French system. The British sys
tem is built on caste, and caste will not be a safe founda
tion for an army organization in the American republic.
Congress has been wise and unselfish. Now let's see
the army authorities get rid of any prejudices they may
have and can help to put a democratic army upon a demo
cratic foundation from the start.
It is an inspiring thing to consider the American re
public in this possible development of its strength. The
eagle has its wings at last.
UNDESERVED INFAMY.'
Few men in history have incurred the infamy that has
been the portion of General Von Bissing, the former gov
ernor-general of Belgium. His death has served to bring
afresh to the minds of all people the horrors perpetrated
in unlfappy Belgium during his regime. He has stood for
Prussianism at its worst, for all the pitiless cruelty, law
lessness and disregard of human opinion that have been
given the general term of Schrecklichkeit, or "fright
fulness." viewed with loathing by the outer world and
justified by official Germany pn the plea of "military
necessity."
It appears now that Von Bissing was in all probability
no such monster as he has been represented. He uiu net
originate the horrors that have made Belgium an terr.ol
reproach to Germany. He merely obeyed orders. Tin:
Berlin Tageblatt, usually a trustworthy authority, de
clares that "most of the measures taken under his gov
ernorship, which created a world-wide sensation and
aroused a world-wide protest, were not taken by him, but
in spite of his efforts to prevent them." It is even said
that grief over the deeds he was forced to commit and
knovuldge of the loathing with which he was regarded
hastened his death.
If this is true. Von. Bissing must be viewed not as a
bad man. but only a weak man. Strong he was. no doub,
judged by the Prussian standard; but according to no
tions of human conduct prevailing elsewhere, a man at
once conscientious and strong would have refused at all
costs to obey such orders as those for the execution cf
Edith Cavell and the deportation of the Belgians.
The chief significance of recent comment on Von Dis
ing's career lies in its revelation of the man higher up,
the really responsible criminal. The Tageblatt says thav.
the most infamous of Von Bissing's Belgian measures
were ordered direct "from the Kaiser's headquarters."
That statement may be regarded as official. And the
Kaiser, in due time, will be held to answer for his crimes.

TIN TOWN RESIDENTS
ORDERED TO BEHAVE
BY LOWELL OFFICERS
Two of Population Fined and
Given Jail Sentences By
Judge Winters Yesterday
For Boozing And Fighting.
i
War on the hilarious residents of j
Tin Town was officially declared yes- j
terday by Constable Joel Hodges and j
Deputy Sheriff Billy Brekefield. The
declaration was formally made about ;
two o'clock in the morning when the j
off'cers were called to the picturesque j
.M'-.dcan village to quell a miniature
riot, the principal participants being ;
Gic;;o:io Morales and Jose Gonzales, i
Both men were in their homes when
the officers arrived, but the wreckage j
indicated that a battle had been in 1
pro?r.?.3 and they were placed under
airest.
Gonzales pleaded not guilty before
Judge J. L. Winters, in Lowell justice
court, yesterday afternoon but the tes
timony of witnesses proved that he
had taken more booze than he could
properly handle. He was fined $30
and-ordered to serve 30 days in jail
in addition. Morales was given a sim
lar jail sentence and fined $10.
"Tin Town is going to wake up
some fine morning and find part of its
pulption in jail if it doesn't behave"
said the Lowell officers yesterday.
"Fiphtin?, cutting and drinking are
jetting altogether too popular there
find we are going to arrest every per
son who starts the slightest kind of

WHEELER REPORTED
TO HAVE RESIGNED
' TO JOIN THE ARMY
Sheriff of Cochise County Is
Said To Be Preparing To At
tend Officers' Training
Cemp; Welch To Succeed
Kim.
A persistent rumor, believed to be
rased on fact, was current in Bisbee
'ar-t night that Sheriff Harry Wheeler
has resigned, left for the coast, and
is preparing to attend the officers'
training camp at the Presidio, San
Francisco, to be one of the first 10,
COO officers of the greater U. S. army.
Guy Welch, present under-sheriff,
will succeed Sheriff Wheeler as chief
county officer, it was reported, and
will be appointed at the meeting of
the board of supervisors in Tomb
stone next Monday.
V.'heler has seen service with Un
cle Sari's cavalry and is not a novice
at the military game. He was also
a member, and subsequently captain,
of the Arizona Rangers, and his rec
ord with the state organization
shewed him to be a fearless and cool
headed officer. Wheeler was elected
sheriff of Cochise county in 1912 and
re-elected in 1916. His record while
holding this office has been excellent,
narticularly his untiring efforts in the
work of blotting out bootlegging in
this part of the state.
Although his leaving will be a gen
uine loss to the county, Welch, for
years Wheeler's right hand man, will
undoubtedly prove a worthy successor
o the "Little Captain," as he is fa
in iliar with the work of the office, the
men under him and the country in
which he will exercise his duties.

assured, he said, that the money came
from "business persons" who tympa

How I
got them Crisp
(Report No. 7) By a waffle fierA
I travel quite a bit.
I sometimes order
waffles in hotels, but
somehow they never
come crisp enoueh.
So the other day I got
enterprising. I had a
waffle iron sent home.
"Now honey," said I,
"Let's have some real
waffles. I want you to
make them yourself."
I had heard that Cot
tolene made crisp cook
ing, so we agreed to use
Cottolene. I hung
around the kitchen and
watched. After the sift
ing and mixing, the
Cottolene was added
a third less than our
butter recipe called for.
Some more finishing
touches. Then my wife
swabbed the waffle iron
with Cottolene, poured
in the batter and
Well, I never tasted
waffles so deliciousl
They were a rich golden
brown. And crisp 1 My,
how crisp those waffles
were! I never tasted
waffles anytohire that
were so crisp.
We served them hot,
with real Chautauqua
County syrup.
My wife had never
made waffles before, but
after that first batch, she
might have qualified as
waffle champion of the
world. Or should the
championship go to
Cottolene?
Perhaps you had bet
ter try it yourself and see.

FRENCH CATTLE DECREASING
(By Review Leased Wire).
Paris, May 4. Report from the De
partment of Agriculture calls atten
tion to the alarming decrease in
France's cattle reserve. The stock
of bovine animals, whioh. prior to the
war, numbered 14,800.000, is now re
duced to 12,400,000 while the short
age of sheep is still more marked.
The re-stocking of the devastated re
conquered French areas will cause a
further depletion of the reserve, the
deficit caused by the Cerman invas
ion being estimated at 800.000 head.
The government hopes to make some
large cattle purchases in Switzerland

We cannot all go to war. We are not all the right age limit and with the rugged
physical standards demanded of the warrior, yet we can all do a service by engaging in
the production of a national, international life necessity in the production of more OIL.
The consumption of oil is 200,000 barrels per day more than the production and
unless more oil is produced in the immediate future we will have a United States Oil Dic
tator. The auto owners and other consumers would be told by their government how
many gallons per day or per week or per month they might consume. Last week
Roosevelt advocated the limitation on the consumption of gasoline.
Developing oil properties is the greatest profit-paying business in the world today.
