OF OCCUPATION. Not. 19, (By
the Associated Press.) Well into
Belgium and within a few hours'
march of the German frontier on
the south. Mai. Gen. John P. Dick-
man's army gathered itself
today for another ;ump into evacu
ated territory.
The line was unchanged. In accord
ance with the plan, the march has
been baited for a short time, while
the heavier artillery, supplies and oth
er elements can be brought up. How
ever, General Dickman's headquarters
were' to Longuyon tonight and corps
and divisions commanders mads sim
ilar advances. As the Germans with
drew, the concentration of the armyi
of occupation is increased and not for
a moment has vigilance been relaxed.
All possible tactical advance is care
fully taken and the forces are so de
ployed that the peaceful march might
easily, in the presence of the enemy,
be converted into a hostile opera
tion. . The second day of the advance
served to confirm the belief at the
American headquarters, that there
was no thought of treachery in the
minds of the German general staff,
and that the terms of the armistice
will be faithfully carried out
There have been a few isolated
cases where surrendered materials
have been damaged but it is thought
such damage was wrought under or
ders of German commanders. The sur
render of damaged airplanes at the
airdrome In Tellancourt is regarded
as a case where individual aviators
determined to put their machines out
of commission, rather than have them
fall into the hands of an enemy much
as a cavalryman wottld shoot a favor
ite horse to save him from a like
fate.
.Enormous stores of ammunition
and many guns left at Longuyon were
little impaired and the machine shops
there had not been damaged. The

armistice with Germany was
signed, are described in the Jour
nal la Belgique, a newspaper pub
lished in Brussels for four years
under control of the German cen
sorship in its issue of November
11.
Thousands of soldiers without
arms gathered in front of the
North station and formed a pro
cession which marched through
the North boulevard, carrying red
and French flags. The populace,
at first dumb with astonishment
at the strange eight, enthusiasti
cally cheered the soldiers carry
ing the French tri-color and
shouted "Hurrah for Belgium!"
"Hurrah for France!" The pro
cession halted at the Palace of
Justice where a meeting was or
ganized and a banner raised on
which was inscribed: "Com
rades!" Do not fight any more!
Do not shoot!" A Belgian dem
onstration was then organized in
which the German soldiers joined
with the Belgians in singing the
Brabanconne and the Marseillaise.
An automobile" truck, carrying
German marines and decorated
with Belgian flags appeared on
the Grand Place, where one of the
marines spoke in praise of the
Belgian king and his people.
An automobile in which were
some German superior officers
was halted by soldiers who tore
the epaulets from the officers'
shoulders. The demonstration
continued throughout the after
noon and evening.

Homeward Bound
(Hy Rovi. w l-asl Wirt-)
GHENT, Belgium, Not. 19, (By the
Associated Press.) The last strag
glers of the German forces are pass
ing out of Brussels this evening. It
is a sad cavalcade of sullen, depress
ed men filing out along the road,
heading for Louvain and Liege. Brus
sels is calm. The population is refrain
ing from any manifestation beyond
disdainfully shouting to the depart
ing soldiers, "to Berlin." The soldiers
do not respond, merely smiling sadly.
The correspondent, who went to
Brussels Friday, returned here to
night. In Brussels he received a great
ovation from the inhabitants, which
was somewhat embarrassing, aa desul
tory rifle and machine gun firing was
still going on. He was challenged
several times by members of the sol
soldiers and workmen's representa
tives for his passport.
Reaching the outskirts of . the cit
at 4 o'clock, in the afternoon, the cor
respondent walked to the north sta
tion, where the soldiers committee
was holding a meeting. Suddenly
shots were heard in the direction of
the Palace Brouckers and the crowds
immediately sought refuge indoors.
The correspondent donned civilian
dress and toured the city unmolested.
Many houses were beflagged, but the
mayor, M. Le Mennier, had ordered
that no flags be raised until one was
floating from the halyards of the city
hall.
There is sufficient food in Belgium
for five weeks, according to Femand
Baetane of the Aiuerican. .commission
for relief in Belgium. He said, how
ever, that there was need for rice and
suggested that the supplies be un
loaded at Antwerp instead of at Rot
terdam. Coal is very scarce, selling
at 250 francs a ton. Clothing also is
lacking.
While the people Sunday remained
calm, waiting until the last German
leave, Belgian lancers are ten miles
down the Ghent road, watching for
the signal to enter the city. It is prob
able that Brussels will be free of the
enemy at dawn tomorrow.
The Germans made numerous at
tempB to fraternize with the Belgian
socialists, but Secretary Ruysbreck, of
the socialists' headquarters, refused
to meet representatives of the sol
diers and workmen's council. He
said:'
"Tell our king, tell America, tell
the whole world, that we absolutely
will have no contract with these peo
ple. Our enemies we at no time con
sult as to the future. We do not
know the spirit of the warkmen, but
we know the spirit of the soldiers. ,
"There is no danger of Bolshevism
here."
German soldiers are going about
with huge bags of loot from the quar
termaster's department, selling shoes,
blankets and socks at any price ob
tainable. Good boots were sold for
ten marks.

the German officers impressed hiiu as

naval committee took up revision of
the naval bill for the next fiscal year
and members were insistent that ex

As recommended by the navy de

$2,440,000,000. the estimates being
made in the belief that the war would
continue through next year. Rear
Admiral Earl, chief of the ordnance
bureau, who was before the commit
tee today, said the department is re
vising its estimates and his bureau
alone hud eliminated more than half
of the $400,000,000 calculated as neces
sary next year.
Admiral Earle also revealed that
since hostilitiesceased the ordnance
bureau has cancelled contracts
amounting to $421,359,000.
Secretary Daniels will be called
into the conference tomorrow for
discussion or the navy s needs.
Renresentative Butler of Pennsyl

WASHINGTON, Nov. 19. Dem

with President Wilson tonight for
two hours left the White House
with the impression that the pres
ident now plans to remain in

until the major portion of the
work of the peace conference has
been completed. '
The president was understood to be
especially interested in the applica
tion, in the framing of the treaty, or
the principle of freedom of the seas,
which he enunciated in his 14 terms,
and on which the allies, in agreeing
to discuss peace with Germany, have
reserved the right of freedom of ac

The plan for a league of nations was
another subject to which the president
was said to have given much stud v.
He wa? liuders'ood to regard this a

During his absence from the United
States the president plans to continue
to exercise all the functions of his
office. He will Veep in communica
tion with Washington by wireless
while at sea. and by cable and. if
necessary, by dispatch boats while he

While in France the president was
said to plan transaction of any neces
sary executive business in the Amer

would be on American soil. Should
he visit London or any of the other
allied capitals the embassies there
would become his executive headquar

North Carolina, Pomerene of Ohio,
Walsh of Montana, and Swanson of
Virginia, all chairmen of important
committees. During the day the
president had conferred with Sena
tor Martin of Virginia, the democratic
leader.
The American merchant marine, la
bor problems and the war revenue bilt
were other subjects taken up at the
conference tonight which lasted until
about 10 o'clock. The president was
said to have reiterated bis views od
the necessity for a great fleet of ships
to carry the nation's commerce and
to that end favors continuation of the
government's ship-building, program.
Regarding labor, senators were
said to have been told that mainte
nance of utmost confidence between
employers and employes is particu
larly essential during the period of
reconstruction.
Retrenchment in federal expendi
tures, as far as is consistent, was
said to be desired by the president,
who told the senators he already had
taken teps to that end. In this con
nection, the pending war revenue bill
was discussed especially with Senator
Simmons, chairman of the senate
finance committee. The president
asked regarding prospects of its pas
sage, in view of his approaching de
parture for . France and was advised
by Senator Simmons of the prospect
of delay and determined republican
opposition to the plan proposed by
Secretary McAdoo for determination
in the pending measure of 1920 tax
rates.
Reconstructions and legislative
questions, the senators were said to
have been informed, probably will be
discussed by the president in his ad-
I dress to congress at the opening of
the new session December 2.
At that time he is expected to out
line his views on the necessity for
maintaining some government war
agnecies, at least for a limited period
after the peace treaty is signed.
The. president plans to sail for
France soon after congress recon
venes, and it was understood that for
this reason he desires the leisurely
conference tonight covering the broad
field of legislation and other ques
tions. In connection with the presi
dent's plans for transacting his busi
ness with an American embassy as
headquarters, it was undertood that
he feels there will be little difference
in disposing of legislative questions
that arise. If necessary, it was said,
the engrossed text of a bill could
be sent to hiin by a courier on a dis
patch boat. A veto, it was said, could
be accomplished by cable. In the dis
cussion of legislative questions, it was
said that only those of the coming
session were considered and that no
mention wa made either of pros
pective republican control of the next
congress or of an extra session.

Jiad solicited the loan. Fejgenspan also
testified that he had arranged finan
cial assistance for the Newark (N. J.)
Ledger to the extent of $150,000.
The brewers' organization contrib
uted no part of this fund, he said.
Hugh F. Fox, secretary of the Uni
ted States Prewers' association admit
ted that brewers' propaganda had
been published in the International
Monthly, edited by George Sylvester
Viereck. once editor of the Father
land, a pro-German publication. Fox
said he did not know at the time the
matter was published that the Vie-
1 reck publication was inclined toward
ASK
994
Tovrea
pro-Germanism, but that he has "had
some suspicion of it since then."
Questioned further, by Major E
Lowry Humes of the army, judge ad
vocate general's department, and
counsel for the senate committee. Fox
said it was the business of the brew
ers' association to advertise the pro
duct of brewers and that in doing so
it employed writers to "write up cer
tain subjects" relating to the brewers'
trade.
Writers named in this connection
were.- John Koren of New York, who
wrote matter published in the At
lantic Monthly and whose salary was
believed by Fox to be $5,000 a year;
Dr. Edward H. Williams, author of
articles published in medical and
other journals, and J. G. Rice.
When Secretary Fox was called to
the stand, he produced on subpoenas
from the committee, a bulky package
of letters, pamphlets and other docu
ments of the brewers' association, but
no bank checks or stubs. He said it
had been a long standing practice of
the organization to destroy these.
The witness disclaimed any person
al knowledge of activity by the asso
ciation in political fields in behalf of
state or national legislative candi
dates favorable to legislation permit
ting the use of beer and light wines.
Fox stated that when the brewers
realized that something was brewing
besides beer." referring to the pro
hibition movement, they endeavored
to meet it by advocating use of beer
and light wines. It sought to reach
leaders of public thought and also the
masses of the people. In both ef
forts, the witness said, mistakes had
been made and, finally, the populat
propaganda was abandoned and atten
tion centralized on the leaders of opin
ion. Major Holmes read to the commit
tees letters from the files of the brew
ers' organization in an effort to show
that the brewers' organization em
ployed only union labor and that its
officers believed that by working
through the American Federation of
Labor and other labor organizations,
it could exercise political influence.
Other correspondence produced by
Major Humes for the purpose of
showing that the brewers started a
boycott against other businesses or
merchants opposing the manufacture
of beer.
The inquiry will be continued to
morrow. ALLEN MAKES STATEMENT
MONTGOMERY, Ala., Nov. 19.
Charles H. Allen, publisher of the
Montgomery Advertiser, which testi
mony before a senate investigating
committee today showed was bought
in 1915 with money borrowed from a
Philadelphia bank with brewers as
security, today issued a statement
which said:
"The testimony as given Is inac
curate in an important detail which
will later be cleared up. No loan of
any sort was made to the Montgom
ery Advertiser. I arranged a loan
with the Northwestern National Bank
of Philadelphia for $50,000 each for
myself and for CapL W. T. Sheehan,
in the summer of 1915, the total of
$100,000 being a part of the purchase
price of half the tock owned by
Frank P. Glass.
"The half of the capital stock o!
the Advertiser owned by the estate
of Major Screws, (former editor and
publisher of the Advertiser) was in
no way concerned in the loan. The
policy of the Advertiser as announced
at the time of the purchase of half
the stock, was agreed to between the
representatives of the estate of Major
Screws and the new purchasers as be
ing faithful in carrying out the poli
cies of the paper as it was conducted
under Major Screws. This has been
done."

fully wired and the tools were of the
best.
The railway yards at Montmedy
and other places along the line that
served the Germans as one of their
main arteries of communication dur
ing their last stand against the allied
advance were filled with locomotives
and cars ready for use, while great
quantities of general stores not men
tioned in the terms of the armistice
bad been abandoned to the allies.
Undamaged stores left behind on
every road over which the Americans
advanced bear evidence of the great
retreat.
At Virton was found a great salvage
dump, where tons of clothing, gas
masks and helmets had been 'brought
by the German troops.
A road near St. Leger over which
the correspondent drove just behind
the evacuating armies was so thickly
covered with big iron German helmets
that at times they interfered with the
operation of his automobile.
However, it was not the litter of a
battle field that one saw, or even that
of a disorderly retreat under fire. It
was merely the evidence of the pass
ing of a tired, disheartened foe, who
was going home.
' The country generally presented a
strong contrast to that fought over for
so many years. The Americans
camped today in towns, most of which
bear no trace of warfare.
Here- and there was one which
showed evidences of . the fighting at
the time the - French attempted to
check" the German march through
Belgium. In most of the towns every
house was intact. Amoug the excep
tions are Longuyon and Montmedy,
where a few torn buildings, the result
of American air raids, and aerial
photographs of whose scars have
long been on file at American head
quarteds. The roads over which the Amer
icans travelled are in excellent con
dition due to their distance back of
the former German lines and the lim
ited use made by the enemy of motor
trucks. This, coupled with the almost
constant work upon them by the Ger
mans, kept them in a condition almost
equal to those of France before the
war. The retreating army left on
the roads dozens of steam rollers,
which had been working almost to the
day of its departure.
Although early victims of the -.var,
Belgium's .inhabitants in this quarter
appear better off today than the
French civilians a few miles back.
Wben the American army entered
Virton restaurants were being operat- j
ed and demands for coffee brought
not only this commodity, but also
sugar and cream to go with it. Meat
was scarce. One meat dealer told how
the Germans entered his shop on the
night they left and threw part of his
stock into the street. But he had
some left, including smoked hams,
when the Americans entered.
The shops are better stocked than
those in the French towns the same
distance back of the line. Women's
clothing, ranging from the lacy and
befrilled to smartly tailored gar
ments is prominently displayed in the
windows, while tobacconists have
their show cases filled with various
brands of cigarettes and cigars. The
wind shops have not such varied
stocks as in France but just as aound
ant supplies of champagne.
The civilians in Virton and other
villages tell stories of German arro
gance and oppression, but tales of
atrocities are few. Apparently those
Germans who were in power in that
part of Belgium ruled sternly, but not
viciously alter the early part of the
war.
St. Leger is one of the places that
felt the terrible grip of the German
hand in the first year of warfare. It
was there that 100 civilians were
executed:
When the Americans began pouring
into Virion, the largest of the re
occupied towns, the inhabitants
had nothing too good for them. Flags
of the allied nations flew from almost
every house front, side by side with
the Belgian colors, while women, es
pecially the younger ones, appeared
in their Sunday finery in honor of the
occasion. The mayor had a busy role
as olflcial host.
Women and children gathered about
the men in khaki, regardless of rank,
the enlisted receiving almost as much
attention as he who wore the insignia
of rank.
I Old women cried w hile they smiled,
'and choked over expressions of greet
ings and thanks. Aged men .spent
' the day in the streets shaking hands
with American soldierj. while chil
! dren followed about, eager lor a
I glance or a word from the strange be
I Ings whom they addressed alternute
! ly in German and French, not com
prehending w hy they were not under
stood. Hut they did comprehend the un
usual and unheard of manner of their
own reception. American soldiers lift
ed the little ones to their shoulders,
bought them chocolates and did their
best to entertain them.
Two tots of aixiut four years watch
ed the inarchin? troops from the seat
gf a motorcycle sidecar which was
parked by the roadside, and a boy a
year older sat on the driver's seat
"guarding" it for a dispatch rider who
was getting a cup of col fee nearby.
At St. Leger all the civilians gath
ered in the main street an hour before
the troops marched in. One old man
bore the flag of his country, and be
hind him was a small, hastily re
cruited brass band. When the troops
arrived the crowds shouted them
selves hoarse. The old man's flag
was saluted by the officers of the
American command.
Children began to race after the
marching columns. Crowds gathered
about every detachment. The mayor
opened his house and insisted upon
serving wine and offering his hospi
tality to auy American who would
lodge with him.
There, as in towns further back,
was met the unending stream of re
patriation men. Prisoners of war, sol
diers of almost every allied nation,
tramped tard the advanciug Amer
ican line. Most of them wer in fair
physical condition, even if grotesque
ly dad. All are being sent to the
rear for classification and transporta
tion to their own armies or homes.
The Germans had one hospital in
Virton. When they found it incon
venient to evacuate all the patients,
some were left, the civilians agree
ing to care for them. The mayor's
proclamations calling upon the inhabi
tants to care for the sick, feed the
prisoners ofywar and returning civil
ians were posted prominently about
the city, alongside German orders reg
ulating the sale of drinks and desig
nating certain restaurants for officers
and others for men. Beside them ap
peared theater bills of concerts and
vaudeville. The Germans were not
without amusement wherever they
stayed and motion picture shows aad
theaters are preparing to open to
night. It has been suggested that the ap
parent prosperity of the villages ent
ered as indicated by the quantities or
food in the restaurants may not be
w holly real and that perhaps is it is
more to the fact that the German
has seen to it that the restaurants
and shops they patronized were well
cared for. Whaf were seen by the
Americans, after all, were but limited
stocks.

WILSON AND PEACE
The announcement of President Wil
son that he .intended to sail for Europe to
attend the international peace conference,
at which will be determined the terms to
be imposed upon the humble central pow
ers, created little surprise in America, even
though by making this decision he depart
ed from precedent laid down by his pre
decessors. President Wilson has shattered
other precedents, and to use a rather vul
gar expression, "has gotten away with the
play in beautiful style." When he read
his message before joint sessions of con
gress, a precedent was overturned with a
crash that echoed throughout the nation.
The president has allowed it to become
known that he' intends to leave immedi
ately after the convening of congress and
probably will be absent for a month or
more. Further, it is made known from
those near Mr. Wilson, that he will go at
the express invitation of the British and
French premiers, to lend the assistance of
his mature statesmanship to the task of
steering the ship of peace over the perilous '
course of the early days of the conference.
President Wilson, the acceptance of
whose ideas of an equitable peace by the
leaders of both sides, made the present arm
istice with Germany possible, undoubtedly
will be an invaluable aid to the statesmen
of allied nations in framing the peace
terms based upon his conditions. He, bet
ter than any other, can interpret his exact
meaning, though on account of his pre
cise phraseology little was left to doubt
and only in one or two clauses was ambigu
ity found. At the preliminary conferences
and at the peace table, his assistance will
be invaluable.
That is the meaning of the visit of Wil
son, the statesman. The visit of Wilson,
the president and man, to Europe has still
another meaning. In his person is found
the recognized leader of the ideals of liberty
as conceived by the masses of Europe, mil
lions of whom died on the battle field in
order that liberty might survive. In his
visit to London, in his visit to Paris and
again in his visit to Rome, the sons and
daughters of those ancient countries will
see a good omen. He will be feted and
lauded as few men have been in all his
tory. In him and through him, America
can be proud of the place she has assumed
in the family of nations, which is that of a
leader.
THE TWO DESPOTS
The essence of democratic liberty is per
suasion. The bclsheviki is a partisan of force. He
is an even worse enemy of true democ
racy than the monarchial autocrat, for
while he is as willing to use force to rule
the will of men as a. czar or kaiser, the
force he lets loose is not disciplined or
controlled even by himself. The monarch
ical or militant despot may use a disciplined
military organization to enforce his will;
the bolshevik uses a mob. One uses a
dam to hold back the waters of popular
freedom. The other sets ungovernable
flame at general destruction.
The bolshevik, the mob autocrat, and
the kaiser, the military autocrat, are both
deadly enemies or true democracy and true
democratic freedom.
Bolshevism, wherever it appears, under
whatever name, relie3 upon force. In Rus
sia it has slain men and women who dis
agree with its dogmas, as ruthlessly as any
Caesar. In the French terror it did the
same a century and more ago. In Ger
many it demands that a great class of cdu
cated, responsible, industrious citizens be
refused representatign in the government,
and it will prevent them by slaughter.
These disfranchised citizens include the
lawyer,- physician, teacher, clergyman,
business man, down to the smallest shop
keeper in fact, all Hie classes which do
not work with their hands, whatever their
intelligence, character or service to organ
ized society and civilization as it has devel
oped up to our day. The bolshevik would
bar all this vast body of knowledge, ex
perience and character from any part in the
government, silence its voice, seize its pos
sessions, rule it with a rod of iron. In Rus
sia the bolshevik regime has slaughtered
the middle class without pity or justice. It
pretends to do this in the name of justice
and progress. In reality it is turning hu
manity back into the jungle.
The bolshevik and the -militarist auto
crat are united in another essential. They
are both believers in their own divine right.
Lenine, the fanatic, believes he is com
missioned by the superiority of his intel
lect and moral nature to force his will on all
who disagree with him. There is no differ
ence, except in statement, between this
claim and that of an absolute monarch to
his right of rule. The kaiser has his divine
right. The bolshevik has his divine dogma.
Both are inconsistent with freedom and
true democracy which make all equal in
rights and rest progress on reason and the
triumph of reason's appeal over the human
mind.
THE DOOMED ARMADA
Somewhere on the swelling bosom of the
North Sea, an armada of the once proud
German nation has met or soon will meet
the all-powerful, conquering grand fleet of
Great Britain, together with representa
tives of the sea power of America and
France, to complete the surrender in fact
of the greatest number of war vessels, the
most powerful set of floating fortresses,
ever given up by any nation in the history
of the world. Unless the terms of the arm
istice have been disregarded, each of the
vessels will be but a shell of its former
fighting strength; all were to have dis
armed before they left Germany's harbors.
Upon receiving these derelicts, which
represent practically the total strength of
the formerly powerful Hun navy, the com
mander of the great fleet is to direct the
course to a port or ports not yet desig
nated. Upon their arrival, the vessels are
to be interned with only watchmen on
board.
Germany has left a few vessels, of an
obsolete type, sufficient to give her rating
as a third or fourth rate power, but in them
selves an emblem of the depth to which
has fallen the haughty realm of the Pru3-.
sian king who dared consider himself the
annointed of God, who dared assume the
title of the All-Highest, who dared to
dream and plan and plot for world con
quest, who plunged the world Into the
deepest misery known in the history of
man.
Wilhelm Hohenzollern, whose house of
cards, even ' though bound together with
segments of steel from the treasure house
of Alsace-Lorraine, has crashed to earth,
has passed from power. Socialism has sur
planted the absolutism of the Prussian war
lord. Bolshevism appears to impend dan
gerously. Where the end may be none
may predict at this time. But with the
passing of Germany's navy, which at the
beginning of the great war, ranked second
only to that of Great Britain, another chap
ter in the history of the titanic struggle is
closed, and at its closing, well may the sons
of Freedom, Liberty and Equality rejoice.
WHAT HE WAS CELEBRATING
There was one outburst of joy that was
not lost when rejoicing was going on all
over the nation several days ago following
a premature report of the signing of, the
armistice. It was in Topeka, Kansas. The
celebrant was an old negro. He was not
disturbed and did not share in the general
chagrin and anger a few hours later when
the rumor which sent the whole country to
rejoicing had been denied.
He did not care a continental whether
the armistice had been signed or not. He
did not know what an armistice was. He
hadn't heard anybody say anything about
any armistice. He thought that the whole
country was celebrating the election of a
republican congress. He remembered af
terwards seeing a lctot hilarious democrats
whooping it up along with therest of them,
and he thought it a little strange that they
should gloat over their defeat. But he
reasoned that even a democrat might
change his mind and habits, and reform.
Profound disgust at the stupidity of elec
tion results is expressed by many voters
who did not take the trouble to go to the
polls.
The only people who have contributed
nothing to the securing of a grand and
glorious peace are the pacifists.
GRAND CANYON IS AT
LAST TO BE MADE A
State and County News Briefs
AFTER THIRTY-FIVE YEARS CON
GRESS IS TO PLACE NATION'S
WONDERLAND FOREVER UN
DER CARE OF UNITED STATES
NATIONAL PARK! County News
The Grand Canyon of Arizona at
last is to be made into a national
park. For years the canyon has been
quite generally regarded as a pare,
but officially it is a section of two
national forests, a game refuge and a
national monument.
"It has never been managed as a
part of the park system, and has
never been susceptible of develop
ment as such," says the house public
lands committee, in reporting favor
ably a senate bill that would dedi
cate 950 square miles 600,000 acres
in northern Arizona as the Grand
Canyon National Park. "This mag
nificent gorge should now take its
place as a link in the national park
chain which already includes most of
the nation's wonderful and extraordi
nary natural features."
First Bill in 1886
It was 32 years ago last January
that the first bill to make the Grand
Canyon a national park was intro
duced in the senate by the late ex
President Benjamin Harrison, then a
senator from Indiana.- Since then the
proposal has been presented to con
gress from time to time.
"It appears that there never has
been a valid objection advanced
against it," declares Secretary Lane,
in a statement favoring the project.
"Nor can such an objection be urged.
because the Grand Canyon belongs
to the federal government and any at
tempt to thwart a change in its status,
which would distinctly redound to its
advantage, must be by some private
interest."
Private Development
Judge Alfred C. Lockwood was in
Douglas from Tombstone yesterday
morning and conducted juvenile court
at the city hall. There were a number
of cases came up. The most impor
tant was that of Maria Louisa Dujun

and a half old daughter. Another case
disposed of was that of six boys im

WHY PUTTER WITH

Common-Sense, Simple, Never Fails
You can tear out your corns and suf

"Gets-It" way. It is the only happy
painless way in the world. Two drops
"Ct th Drop" on That Cora-Ute "GU-lt

of 'Gets-lt" on any corn or callus dries
at once. The corn finally loosens cff
from the toe, so that you can peel it
off with your fingers in one piece,
painlessly, like peel I m; a banana.
Great stuff, wish I'd done that be
fore." There's only one corn-peeler
"Gets It." Toes wrapped up big with
tape and bandages, toes squirming
from irritating salves, it's all a bar
barity. Toes wounded by razors and
knV.es, that's butchery, ridiculous, un
necessary, dangerous. Use "Gets-It",
the liberty way simple, painless, al

"Gets-It." Don't be insulted by imi

RETENTION OF
GOOD LEADERS
(By Review Leased Wire)
WASHINGTON, Nov. 19. Steps to
retain permanently in the army offi
cers commissioned from civil life who
have displayed marked ability in the
service are being considered by the
general staff. Plans for the demoblt
zation of officers, it was learned to
day, are being shaped with this end
in view.
The first of the approximately 160
000 men in the officers corps released
will be those who are anxious to
sever completely their connection
with military life. Applications from
these men for release, officials said,
will be acted upon promptly.
Consideration, it) was said, next
will be given to applications from offi
cers who wish to return to civil life,
but to retain their status as reserve
officers, subject to call for a period
of years. General staff officials be
lieve that a large portion will follow
this course thereby giving the United
States an adequate supply of compe
tent reserve officers for the first time
in history.
In passing officers back into the
inactive reserve list, care will be
taken to hold to the last officers who
desire to apply for commissions in
the regular establishment and whose
records show them to be fitted for
regular army life.

GERMAN UNITS
CROSS BORDERS
Please, Consult the Directory
WITH THE AMERICAN ARMY OF
OCCUPATION, Nov. 19. By the As
sociated Press.) With the excepSon
of a few laggard units the last of Ger
many's armies disappeared today be
hind their own frontier. From the
illages located in the narrow strlt
of unoccupied territory between the
American and German forces came re
ports during the day that the strag
glers last night and early this mora
ing had engaged in looting.
Appeals were received from the in
habitants that the advancing Ameri
cans hasten to their relief. Investiga
tion proved, however, that the vil
lagers were more excited than injured
and that most of the damage was be
ing done by the little groups of Ger
mans, to the Germans' own stores ol
food and clotLiiig.
Other appeals were found to have
more foundation than those from the
mayor of Halauzy and other neighbor
ing towns reported the presence ol
wounded and sick in greater numbers
than the local physicians could at
tend and to those points medical offi
cers and supplies were sent, after
notification to the Germans of the
Americans' plan. When the Germans
evacuated these towns they took with
them not only the medical and nurs
ing staffs, but also the hospital sup
plies, abandoning the sick and wound
ed to the mercies of the townspeople
and the army of occupation.
Such was found to be the case in
the hospital at Longwy, where was
located the 32nd division headquar
ters. Six wounded Americans were
found there, three of them officers.
Two were aviators reported missing
in October. They were flying low
when attacked by six Fokkers and
forced to land within the enemy lines.
C CALLING for telephone numbers from memory is not safe from a oozw
J senration-of-tiiae standpoint.
A mistake in the number doubles the time of the operator and of the use
of the equipment employed.
One's memory is so apt to play tricks with telephone numbers. It is so
apt to prompt you, for instance, to say, 9-7-8 when the number really is
7-9-8.
A wrong; number wastes the time of the person called, of the operator and
of the person celled in error, and involves use of needed equipment.
In the end it is necessary to consult the Directory. Why not consult the
Directory at the first, if only to confirm the dictates of your memory?
The point is that anything that unnecessarily takes the time of the operators
and of equipment may be needlessly delaying calls occasioned by fire, law
lessness, accident, deafa, serious illness, calls necessitated by the public in
terest and welfare, calls on Government business or war work or commer
cial ealb of vital importance. '
Please do your full share in the task of furnishing: telephone service to this
community by patriotic consideration of the time of our operating forces.
CONSULT THE DIRECTORY before calling-, to insure giving; the corre
number. Then, t . i
' J 1 r'r
SPEAK DISTINCTLY, LISTEN ATTENTIVELY and , - tJifpri-i -,y
MAKE YOUR CONVERSATION BRIEF. i'T
That will help the service. It will help those who are earnestly striving to
serve you well. J )

ous matter.

Made Morale Officer at Camp
Cody, Continuing on Divis
ion Staff in Different Ca-
pacity
Cpt. M. E. CasKidy. until a few
months ago resident of this district,
and former claim adjuster for the
Phelps Dodge corporation, now in the
service of the United States at Camp
Cody, N. M., received signal promo
tion and advancement within the past
week, according to word reaching this
district from Camp Cody yesterday.
In the future Captain Cassidy will be
morale officer for Camp Cody. Here
tofore he has been assistant to the
camp adjutant. The new appointment
is one of highest importance and is a
decided advancement above the form
er assignment.
The morale officer in charge of a
divisional camp such as Cody is in
general a specialist on the subject of
morale, and it is his duty to bring
about the maintenance in the camp of
all conditions favorable to the up
building of the best possible morale.
The office is one' of swecprng duties
and powers; and is noti limited in
scope. The morale officer is assigned
to the general staff of the command
ing general of, the division, and the
organization at which such officer ?
head includes all commanding offi
vers and not less than two non-commissioned
officers in each company.
When Captain Cassidy left this dis
trict he was assigned to Camp Cody
as assistant to the camp ad Hit ant with
the rank of captain. He had qualified
for the rank of major, but prefered
the appointment selected because it
offered active service and a cuicker
opportunity to go abroad. He has
been at Crfmp Cody since, assisting
in the training and preparation of
the division stationed at that point.
Like other men in the army, he does
not know and ventures no opinion a
to what disposition will now be made
of himself and others at Camp Cody.
Duties of the new office to which
he has been assigned are numerous
and of wide variety. They include
the gathering of data and information
relative to the state of morale at trie
camp; the correction of conditions
about the camp which might affect
the morale; the co-ordination of the
efforts of the non-military agencies
for the physical, mental and morale
welfare; the finding and recommend
ing of the best methods for the form
ing and maintaining cf sound morale
thronch conferences and investiga
tions and to submit plans for the up
lift of morale to the commanding of
ficers of the division; to examine rec
ords and experiences for suggestions
e fmorale betterment to be transmit
ted to other camps; the dealing out
of news matter and other m-.iterial
concerning events and activities o?
the camp to the newspapers: co-gpera-tion
to the fullest extent with the In
telligence officers of the diivsion; and
the general upbuilding of the enthus
iasm, mental courage, vigor and fight
ing spirit of the army.
The creation of the morale officer
in the United States army dates back
but few months, when it was real
ized that the new division working in
co-operation with organizations al
ready formed could assist materially
in building up the army of the United
States. Captain Cassidy's appoint
ment as morale officer dotes from
October 31, but his friends here have
just been advised of the new assign
ment. ROAD WORK BEING
DONE IN CODNTY
Work on the Darabacomi road from

FRUIT PITS ARE
NQ LONGER NEEDED
The following circular, calling ort
the campaign for fruit pits, has been
received by the local chapter of the
Red Cross:
To All Chapters in the Pacific Di
vision, Attention.
We are in receipt of word from
Washington that in view of the sign
ing of the armistice the campaign for
the collection of fruit pits and nut
shells is to be discontinued, and tJie
gas defense division in San Francisco
has notified us that they have been
instructed to refuse additional ship
ments. Any pits remaining on hand which
the government refuses to accept can
probably be sold for fuel.
All other branches of salvage and
shop work should be continued as '.-t
the past.

In buying our stock you invest in a proven oil property.
LISTEN: In drilling our hole we encountered true oil
bearing sand, carrying rich parafine petroleum, the
highest grade and jnost valuable and therefore, the
most marketable of oils, bringing the highest price of
all crude oils.
We may confidently expect, now that peace is assured,
a steadily advancing market in petroleum, this has been
predicted by the WALL STREET JOURNAL of last
week's issue.
In further drilling and upon reaching the source of these
oil ssnds, Oil in greater volume will inevitably resuk
er.d then look out for soaring prices in this stock.
Treasury stock, now selling at 20 cents, will leap at once
above the $ mark and up and up, its a cinch. Get in
now, as every day counts. Investigate and you will
buy. We court investigation, as we state the FACTS.
