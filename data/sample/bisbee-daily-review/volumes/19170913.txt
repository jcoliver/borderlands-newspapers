GERMAN CHARGE AT BUENOS
AIRES GIVEN PASSPORTS BY
G0VER1EJTJF ARGENTINE
Foreign Minister of Argentine Government Sends Count Lux.
burg His Passports, Declaring Him Persona Non Grata.
Germany Must Disavow His Words, or State of War Will
Be Declared With South American Country.
BUENOS AIRES, Sept. 12. The downtown section of the city was
the scene of wildest disorders tonight in connection with great anti-German
demonstrations in which thousands of Argentinians took part. Many
of those in the mobs carried firebrands and as a result scores of build
ings were set on fire. Several blocks of German business houses in Calle
25 de Mayo were destroyed.
German Club On Fire.
Among the structures attacked were the German club, one of finest
edifices in the city and the building of the German daily. La Union. As
fast as the fires in these buildings were extinguished, they were started
again. Mounted patrols and the entire fire department kept rushing from
one part of the city to another, in an attempt to quell the riots and put
down the flames. In several instances police who were attempting to
shoot at those wielding torches were Bet upon by the crowds and disarmed.
To Protect Luxburg.
Extraordinary precautions have been taken by the authorities to pro
tect Count Luxburg, the" German minister, when he arrives here tomor
row morning, to receive his passports.
BUENOS AIRES, Sept. 12. The Argentine government at noon today
sent to the German legation passports to be delivered to Count Luxburg, the
German minister in Buenos Aires. The whereabouts of Count Luxburg still
is unknown to the Argentine government.
Demand Explanation.
The Argentine foreign office today sent a communication to the German
foreign ministry, demanding an explanation of Count Luxburg's action in
sending the secret code messages to Berlin through the Swedish legation.
No War Yet.
It was officially announced here that if Germany failed to disapprove of
Count von Luxburg's action, Argentina would recall her minister at Berlin.
If the Berlin government disapproved of his course, the status quo would be
maintained.
Persona Non Grata.
The note sent by Foreign Minister Pueyrredon to Count von Luxburg in
which the German minister was tendered his pas spot rs reads:
"Mr. Minister:
"You have ceased to be persona grata to the Argentine government, that
government has decided to deliver to you your passports which I transmit
herewith by order of His Excellency, the president of the nation.
"The introducer of embassies has instructions to assist you in your im
mediate departure from the territory of the republic. God keep you.
"(SIGNED) . H. PUEYRREDON."
"Karl von Luxburg, envoy extraordinary and minister plenipotentiary of
the German empire."
, President Silent.
The decision to hand Count von Luxburg his passports was reached by
Irigoyen after a conference with the foreign secretary but without consulting
the cabinet, which had been called to meet this evening and receive Ambassa
dor Naon's dispatches from Washington. The president maintains-d that
the matter was gra've enough and pressing enough to warrant his immediate
decision.
Sweden Not Effected.
It is believed unlikely that any action will be taken toward Sweden, yes
terday's explanation by the Swedish legation apparently satisfying the gov
ernment that Baron Lowen acted in good faith in forwarding the telegrams,
the contents of which were unknown to him.
No Demonstrations.
During the three days that elapsed while the government was satisfying
itself as to the accuracy of the exposures made in Washington, the public
despite the gravity of the accusations, responded to the appeals of govern
ment officials and the newspapers by refraining from any anti-German dem
onstrations. Public Against Germans.
The feeling of the Argentine public in the present instance was mani
fested today, howevre, when immense crowds in front of the newspaper bul
letin boards cheered the news that Count von Luxburg would have to leave
the republic.
Mob Attacks Paper
BUENOS AIRES. Sept. 12. Im
mense ci'jwds joined in an anti-German
demonstration here this after
noon. The German legation and Ger
man newspaper buildings were stoned.
There was serious rioting and mount
ed police charged the mobs in the
fashionable Avenida FloOrida. De
spite the strong mounted guard, a
mob broke all the windows in the of
fices of the newspaper La Union.
Argentina's Course
WASHINGTON. Sept. 12 Argen
tina's course for the remainder of the
war probably will be determined by
Germany's answer to the demand sent
fi'jm Buenos Airs that the Berlin
government disavow the action of Its
minister in advising the sinking of
Argentine ships '"without leaving any
trace." and in calling the Argentine
foreign minister "a notorious ass."
Up to Germany
Whether Germany will force the big
South American country into the list
f htr enemies is a question jf more
immediate interest here than the out
come of Sweden's part in the trans
mitting of (lie German messages.
May Take' Loophole
By many officials it is regarded as
improbable that Berlin will fail to take
advantage promptly of the looplioTe
left by Argentina's offer to maintain
a status quo in return fi'jm repudia
tion of the minister's action.
Acceptance would be regarded here
as tantamount to fixing Argentina s
part in the war, since sinking of more
ships is improbable with only a neKli
ble number of trans-Atlautic vessels
flying the Argentine flag.
LONDON, Sept. 12 According to

ing has been reached for the co-operation

Painleve Is Able

(By Review Leased Wire.)
PARIS, Sept. 12. M. Painleve ha
succeeded in organizing a ministry to
replace the Ribot cabinet. For a time
the socialistic radical group present
ed an obstacle to the formation of
the ministry, ruling that the five so
cialist radical members of the cabi
net as selected by M. Painleve should
not be members of a cabinet where
the unified socialists were "not repre

added today at the administration's
request, would extend present presi

hi samendment as a "curb against the
vipers in our midst," trying to create
dissension.

Utah senator, "that the press the ,

General Manager of Phelps
Dodge CorporationResigns,
Rumors of Several Days
Confirmed Yesterday.
Stuart W. French has resigned his
position as general manager of the
Phelps Dodge corporation. Rumors to
this elfect have been in circulation In
Bisbee for several days. I; became
known yesterday that Mr. French ten
dered his resignation to the board of
directors seme time ago, and that re
cently it was accepted.
Now in East
Mr. French has been in the east
since about the middle of July anc
hence nothing can be stated as to his
plans for the future. He was made
genera! manager of the Phelps Dodge
corporation at the time Walter Doug
las vacated the position to bec'jme
president, which was in July of last
year. He has been with the Phelps
Dodge interests since the year 1899.
It was then that he came to Bisbee
from Chicago . to become assistant
manager cf the old Copper Queen Con
solidated company. He remained in
Bisbee until 1904 when he renjved to
Douglas and assumed charge of the
then new smelter in that city. He
has resided there since that time, in
the year 1910 when Walter Douglas
was made general manager of the
Phelps Dodge company Mr. French
succeeded him as -general manager of
the Copper Queen, assuming direction
of the mines of the company as well
as of the smelter.
Prominent Residents
Mr. and Mrs. French have always
been prominent in the higher strata
of s'jeial Douglas and Mr. French has
always taken a pride in doing every
thing possible in the work of building
the city of Douglas. He was prom
inent In promoting the Douglas Coun
try club and was its first president,
serving two years in succession and
has 'jnce since been called to the pres
idency of the club. Mrs. French has
also done a great deal for Douglas, giv
ing her aid to all civic organizations.
During her residence in Cochise
county she has been presiden: of Ari
zona Federation of Woman's clubs and
was instrumental in the organization
jf the Woman's club of Douglas. Last
year she Joined heartily into the work
of organization in the Smelter City
of the Young Women's club of Doug
las. She was made president of the
organization and holds this position
now. Both Mr. and Mrs. French have
also been active in Red Cross work,
and In many ways giving assistance
to matters planned to help the coun
try in war.
It is not known when Mr. and Mrs.
French will return to Douglas and un
til their arrival, probably about Octo
ber 1. of course, nothing can be said as
to his future plans, though the hope
of his many friends here will be that
he may remain in the west, where they
may occasionally enjoy a visit from
him, should he decide to remove his
home from Douglas.
When Mr. French leaves Cochise
county he will leave a region where
be has won the high esteem and con
fidence of its citizens, and especially
of those who have been directed by
him in their efforts for the company,
which has been go eminently suffessful

but his splendid influence and keen
judgment must have done much Tor
the general morale of Douglas. The
immense regard his personal and
business friends feel on account of his
retirement from the general manager
ship of the Phelps Dodge corporation
will not be fully realized until after
he has left this section.
President Walter Douglas, of the
company, who is now In Bisbee, when
asked about who would be the suc
cessor of Mr. French, stated that this
matter was under consideration, but
no announcement could be made at
this time.

belongings. We demand state protection during stay there."
The message addressed to President Wilson:
President Addressed.

INVESTIGATION
OF NEGRO RIOTS
ENDS
N HOUSTON
Municipal Board of Texas
City Completes Its Probe
Into Reasons Behind Re
cent Rioting by Black Soldiers.
! (By Review Leased Wire.)
HOUSTON, Texas, Sept 12. Com
pleting an Inquiry irto the causes of
1 the recent negro soldiers' riot which
'cost the lives of fifteen citizens of
, Houston, the citizens' board filed Its
report with the city council today,
i The report covers virtually every
j phase of the recent trouble and deals
: with the police situation in Houston,
j Arrests Cause Riot
, The committee is of the opinion
j that the riot undoubtedly was pre
i cipitated by two arrests of negroes
made by Officer Sparks, although suf
i ficient evidence was presented at the
hearing to reveal the fact that a se-
rious disturbance was intended by
j some of the negro soldiers before
: leaving Houston and the arrests re
ferred to simply brought it to a head
: sooner and Intensified the crimes
; which followed.
Negroes After Whites
I Continuing, the committee says thai
the undisputed and convincing testi
mony of witnesses prove that the ne
gro soldiers went forth to slay the
white populatio n indiscriminately;
that not one negro was hurt or mo
lested by them; not one nesro home
was fired into and that the negroes
were warned before and during the
riot to stay off the streets.
Had Planned Affair
"The testimony of the captain in
' charge of the fire station at Camp
Logan." the report says, "and one of
his assistants is that when the shoot
ing began in the negro camp one of
the negro guards stationed at the
Srt station remarked that the troops
were going to shoot up Houston; that
they had planned to do so on the
preceding Tuesday night, but could
not get quite ready. This testimony
and that of numerous other circum-
stances in the record convince us
(and our opinion is shared by Inspec
tor General I Chamberlain of the
United States army, who so expressed
himself to us), that the prior con
ilicts with the police were mere in
cidents of the riots; that It probablj
would have occurred, thoush possibly
not so severe, had the altercation
between Officer Sparks and the ne
gro Sergeant Baltimore not taken
place."
Hostility Ev'dent
The report calls attention to the
fact that shortly after the arrival ot
the negro troops in Houston there
WPS nianifesied by at least some of
them a feeling of hostilit and defi
ance of the state law requiring the
separation of the white and negro
races in the street cars, when on
leave of absence from the camp the
soldiers frequently visited those sec
tions of Houston and those establish
ments 'where the lewd and lawless
sections of the negro population were
to be found; that the discipline ex
isting at the camp was grossly lax
in moral conditions; lewd negro wom
en, some mere children, being per
mitted freely to visit the camp and
remain there over night, and that
such women were permitted to bring
parcels into the camp without inspec
tion by the sentries, keeping the sol
diers liberally supplied with whisky
and other intoxicants.
Police Officials Censured
Chief among the recommendations
made is that regarding Superintend
ent of Police C. L. Brock.
"In our opinion," says the report,
"he is not qualified for the position
he holds. Ilis course, towards Orli-
cer Sparks shows his inability to en
force discipline in difficulties; his
course on the nitht of the riot shows
that he is nut a safe leader in an
emergency."

President Ban Johnson Makes
Announcement Regarding
Post Season Series.
(By Review Leased Wire).
CHICAGO. Sept. 12. A day will
elapse between the world's series
games played in Chicago, President
Johnson of the American league an
nounced tonight. The railroads of
fered a twenty-hour schedule, which
would permit games to be played in
either each day, but President John
son decided the risk of a delay of
the special trains, thus causing a re
arrangement of the series, was too
great.
Players In the'American league will
be prohibited from writing so-called
"expert" newspaper stories on the se
ries. Johnson said. President John
son characterized the practice as ah
surd.
"It's not a ball player's business to
write." he said, "although some of
them are capable of writing their own
articles.'

Import Powers Needed
In a letter to Senator Ransdell of
Louisiana, who offered the import em
bargo amendment Secretary McAdoo
said the authority was needed to
"control essential raw materials nec
essary to the prosecution of the war,"
as well as to meet conditions of for
eign exchange. He also said it was
desirable in order to "deal with gov

An amendment by Senator Reed
was accepted limiting the bill's op
erations to pinety days after the war.
Insurance Companies Regulated
Supplementing the insurance pro
visions, which in effect would permit
enemy insurance companies to con
tinue operations in this country un

ited their sending funds abroad, the
senate adopted an amendment by Sen

Kerensky Makes
Appeal to Nation
(Continued From Page One.)
Country With Kerensky
"At this moment," M. Nekra,soff con
cluded, "the whole country undoubted
ly Is with Premier Kerensky, who is
defending hte revolution against Gen
eral Kornlloff, the defender of the re
actionaries." Hopes Slight
WASHINGTON, Sept. 12. Reports
reaching here today indicating that
Premier Kerensky's provisional gov
ernment was gaining strength in its
struggle to prevent General Korniloff
from seizing the government, failed to
raise the hopes of Russia's friends to
any great extent.
Doubtful of Future
Although accepting the govern
ment's optimistic announcement that
KorniFjffs followers were few and
that some of his soldiers marching on
Petrograd had offered to arrest their
leader, officials and diplomats said it
was difficult to judge the strength of
the revolt They were impressed with
the view that even should this upris
ing be Quelled promptly, the Interests
secretly approving Kornlfoffs attempt
ed coup would remain as danger ser
ious for Russia's future unity.
Department Not Advised
The state department was still with
out report from Ambassador Francis
concerning the Korniloff movement
and at the Russian embassy it was
said dispatches gave no clear explana
tion of the crisis.
May Take Command
Some doubt is felt here that the :
new commander-in-chief. Major Gen
eral Bonch Bruevitch, Is sufficiently .
well known throughout the Russian
army ranks to inspire great enthu-i
siasm among the troops. For this rea-1
son special interests was taken in ad-;
vance that Premier Kerensky might j
assume command of all the armies, j
supplementing his personality as a
factor in the military situation with!
the expert technical advice of generals
whose loyalty is unquestioned.

154 miles of hard surface roads, a
complete county system.
The estimated cost of the entire
system is $3,000,000 ,and the plan is
Lto issue 20-year bonds for the amount.
The plan contemplates a road connect
ing every city and town in the coun
ty. It provides a road to Arlington
and Pretty Prairie and Huron in th
south and southwest parts of the
county, and a line to Haven in the
southeast one to Buhler in the north- j
west, and one to Nickerson in
lne ;
northwest part of the county.
The roads are to be of monolithic
brick, laid in a foundation of con
crete, the roadways to be sixteen feet
wide.

The plans have been approved by ,

by the federal highway department. ; be an ,nstrumental duet by the Misses

If you have you are worth two citizens who lack this
great essential to success and prosperity.
No stirring news from the Flanders front for a fort
night Only seven weeks of fighting weather left In this
year. Plenty of work for the Sammies in 1918.
The Review's editorial of Tuesday morning about the
need of recreation in the Warren District has already
attracted considerable attention and discussion.
Things go along awhile and then they get worse in
Russia. It is one great ballet with the ex-subjects of the
ex-czar and when they wake up they will be in a German
straight jacket if they don't watch out
When burflars steal ten baby buggies at one haul, as
was the case in El Paso the other night, then the high
cost of living has reached the zenith. Anything that a
gent can get his hands on these days is worth a lot of
money. The old junk dealers are locking up their yards
at night and placing armed men and bull dogs on guard.
Instead of penetrating to the dining room and stealing
the silver, the burglar of this day and age only needs to
ascend to the roof and cut a section of tin therefrom and
call it a good night's work.
The usually calm and conservative editor of the Los
Angeles Times got heated up the other day into a fer
vour that resulted in a half column editorial of bitter
sarcasms and biting epithets, and all because some sub
scriber had written in to question the truth of a previous
editorial that had declared that the, divine Sara Barn
hardt was of Jewish descent The Times editor draws
the Encyclopedia Brittanica upon this presumptious let
ter writer with about the same flourish that William S.
Hart draws a gun in the most stirring scene of his most
stirring picture play. Hey, hum, how the little smarts
and worries vex ns. After editors, all is said and done,
oh ye friends and countrymen, these little aggrevations
are the hardest to bear.
Consider the Rainbow Division, soon to sail for France.
It is the true type and symbol of these United States. Its
members came from every walk of our business and
working life. Clerks and cutters, . miners and mer
chants, lawyers and laborers, druggists and drummers,
printers and poets, policemen and ploughboys, artists
and artisans, bankers and builders, all these joined the
crack militia regiments, leaving their work of yesterday
to fight tomorrow. These men are not soldiers, they are
citizens. When they reach France the allied officers
and peoples will get tho first glimpse of the actual ma
terial of which the American army of a million, soon to
come, mill be composed. As the Rainbow Division is,
the new nationalist army that Is to help bear the brunt
next year, will be.
United States secret agents have scored two distinc
tives in the diplomatic fields of the World War, the first
in the matter of the Zimmerman conspira.. with Mexico
and Japan, and the second the recent exposure of the
duplicity of Argentina and Sweden and the activity of
German agent 8 in these countries and their violation of
neutrality. Sweden in particular Is placed in a bad ligJit
by the disclosures of the United States government. Her
king and court and army officers are strongly pro-German,
while her people are anti-German. But it is the
people who must suffer. Her blindness to German in
trigue and her tolerance of German agents' penilelom
activities are not calculated to help lift the American
embargo on food stuffs. In fact, she Is ou the edge of
a severance of diplomatic relations with the countries
of the entente.
RUSSIA'S FALL-DOWN.
(Los Angeles Times.)
Since America has entered into the war we have taken
on ourselves the responsibility of seeing Russia through,
no less than the task of seeing Prussia out And the
example we set at home is bound to be reflected in the
attitude of the new Slav republic toward the war gen
erally. This is what Charles Edward Russell says, and
his words are certainly worth weighing, especially as he
belongs to the Socialist party in America. Says Russell:
"Riga has fallen, but it did not fall because of super
ior German arms. Its fall may be largely attributed to
the disloyal speeches of United States Senators, At all
public "meetings in Russia pro-German agents tell the
people the United States is not in this war to help them.
To prove that the United States is not at heart in the
conflict speeches by some of our senators have been
read."
Allowing for the usual exaggeration of the special
pleader, this statement of Mr. Russell is a serious indict J
ment of the gang of willful men that thus, consciously or
unconsciously, are strengthening the hands of our enemy
by sowing suspicion in the hearts of our allies. We in
America know that they represent nothing but their own
inconsequential personal prejudices. But their speeches
can readily be distorted by pro-German sympathizers in
Russia into representations of the general feeling in the
United States senate toward our entry and participation
in the great war. Such mischief-makers should not be
allowed, right in the national forum of the American peo
ple, to fight the battle for autocracy by misrepresenting
the views and aims of our government, our armies and
our 100,000,000 people.
Too swift changes, even when the object of the changes
is altogether desirable, inevitably .produce immediate
dangerous reactions. The Russian revolution is a case
in point It was too suddenly sprung; it was too easily
successful not to create a paralyzing effect on the future
activities of its astonished adherents. A glorious light
applied to a people that have long sat in darkness is not
an entirely certain experiment especially when that
purblind people happens to be traveling near the edge of
a precipice.
The revolution has forced concentrated problems on a
scattered nation. Untrained children are suddenly asked
to take over the responsibilities of mature men. Only
with the most careful guidance, the clearest council and
the irreproachable example can the new Russia be tided
over the first stormy years of its existence.
Unless through the help of her allies, which comes
to mean more and more every day the power of the Unit
ed States, the Slavs can be stiffened and backboned and
braced and timbered to the sticking point, the victory
for democracy may come too late to save the big left
wing of the liberty structure that is being erected at the
juncture of Europe and Asia. Otherwise the great Slav
race has simply been given a few moments of free and
feverish breath before replacing the load of Czardom
with the strait-jacket of a Prussian Kaiser.
Rippling Rhymes
(By WALT MASON.)
THE AIMLESS MEN.
(Douglas Internationalist)
A man who has motored from Maine to California says
nothing of the whole trip astonished him so much as the
number of aimless men.
It was bis habit to slide out of the cities early inthe
morning to avoid the traffic, but he was never too early
to miss the men who idle away their days in the public
parks and boulevards. And often he slipped into towns
very late at night but never too late to pass other loit
erers of the same kind.
Even In the parks of cities whose papers are crammed
with ads "Help Wanted Male", these strays are always
to be seen.
On cool days they lounge in the sun, on hot days they
sleep on the grass in the shade. They never seem to
have friends, or to want them. They walk aimlessly.
They sit aimlessly. They look as if aimlessness had
curbed them since they were able to toddle alone. And
probably it has.
Not much can be done to reform the habits of -a man
over 30 years of age. It is not likely any of these men
will ever have a well-defined motive in his life.
But the sight of them should be warning to parents:
Get your child to work toward an end. See that he is able
to define his object.
Success is a habit formed early In life.
And it can hardly escape the man who, Is able to rest
quietly in bed every morning while answering the ques
tion, "What am I going to do today?"
He who is trained in this habit will never have to hunt
a bed in a park.
"PREMATURE PEACE IS LIKE UNRIPE FRUIT."
(From the London Globe.)
Rome Signor Meda, minister of finance, speaking at
milan on the question of peace, said; "Those who delude
themselves by believing that they can blow out the fire
now raging can but stifle the flames while the still smol
dering embers remain beneath. Peace can never, result
from the will of a few people or from the weariness or
resentment of the many.
"Peace is like a fruit, whfr'h, plucked unripe, is use
less; nor can we hasten its ripening against nature. Tli.'
dreamers who preach that we should have peace at once,
whatever kind of peace it may be, only drive further Unto
the future the only real peace by weakening the spirit of
determination and resistance. The peace which Italy
desires is one which will insure for all Europe govern
ment according to the principles of justice, and which
will safeguard Euiope for the future against the devas
tation of war."
SELF PRAISE
I may be loaded down with merit,
but I am foolish to declare it If I
go forth, my worth expounding, and
boosting it in tones resounding, my
friends will mutter, soon or later,
"He is a fourth rate selling plater.
His dome of thought is stuffed with
sawdust; the worth while man is al
ways modest" I often catch myself
beginning to boost myself in language
winning; I tell of big things I'm
achieving, of how competitors I'm
leaving away back yonder in the dis
tance; I tell how I, without assist
ance, climbed upward from the slum
and gutter to heights too wonderful
to utter. I throw myself all kinds of
lilies, then find my hearers have the
willies. They look as though they'd
like to take me to some secluded
spot and shake me. Then, mortified,
humiliated, by self-disgust and an
guish weightied, I fade away, and
while I'm going I wonder why I do
such blowing. The most of us have
sins besetting; the most of us are
oft forgetting that it is foolish to un
fold them, and flaunt them where all
men behold them.
A MAN'S THOUGHT.
Toward what end of life we move
I know not, and I cannot say,
I only know that where we wend
A power of beauty shows the way.
I only know that while we're here,
Or how we drift or whence or why.
There is an unseen presence near.
And 1 shall follow till I tie.
If there's a heaven, well and good,
Or if our heaven is what we find
In peace of heart and that sweet food
Of thought that compasses the mind,
The one thing true to each and all
Is that in perfect sweet we move
Toward some dream within whose
thrall
There dwells immortal hope and love.
I shall not murmur or complain
To know or know not this I feel,
Whatever end may be in store
I have felt perfect moments steal,
And I have known some joy and rest.
Some- comfort and some cheer of soul.
And surging through my contrite
breast
Some union with the spiritual Whole.
Baltimore Sun.
THE SOLDIER'S DOG
Bruce doth watch the whole day long
At the turning of the lane,
Where for mile on misty mile.
One may see the highway plain.
Down that highway, months ago,
Bruce's master marched away;
All the world to Bruce seems strange
Greatly changed since that sad day.
Autumn's leaves have fallen sere,
Winter winds blow cold and chill.
Bruce, with coat all white with snow.
Watches for his master still.
When the frosty twilight falls.
Weary, cold, with heart that yearns
For the sound of a loved voice.
Bruce to the dark house returns.
Season into season wanes.
But the dog his watch must keep
For a man, alas! who lies .
Hushed in death's unending sleep.

DEDUCTION OF PRICE
OF COPPER IK 0. S.
Congressman from the Stale
. of Arizona Writes to War
Industries Board Relative
to the Fixing of Price for
MetaL
Congressman Carl Hayden of Ari
zo 1a is actively engaged in lighting
a'ty attempt of tho war industries
beard to fix a price for copper which
wcu'd be a detriment to the slate of
Arizona. He has appeared bifore tho
'board and lias interceded with it on
i several occasions.
' Following, is printed a letter from
j Mr. Hayden to the board on the sub
ject :
WASHINGTON. D. C..S
Washington. I). C. August 31 1917.
War Industries I'.oard. j
Washington. D. C,
Gentlemen:
I Referring to the hearing which you
I were kind enough to give nie this;
morning, I desire to present in writ-!
ling a summary of the arguments that'
I I then madu relative to the price of,
topper, which yen are soon to deter
mine. In carrying out the announced
policy of the president that the gov-:
eminent and the public should pay,
the same price for any commodity. 1 .
assume that you will attempt to find j
a way to stabilize the general market
price of copper in addition to regulat-j
ins the purchases made for the army
and navy and tho allies.
In your deliberations on this ques
tion I Binecrely trust that you will
give most careful consideration to the
effect of a reduction in the price of
copper upon the wages paid to the
laborers engaged in this industry. I!y
presenting the Miami scale I have
demonstrated that the compensation
of the miners and other employes
varies directly with the monthly fluc
tuation in the price of copper, and
that any reduction will bear heavily
upon them. To reduce the wages of
these men without any corresponding
eduction in the price that they must
pay for the necessaries of life can re
sult in nothing but a decrease in the
total production of copper, because
they will be compelled either to
strike or to seek some better paid
employment.
The cost of living is higher in the
copper (amps of Arizona than any
where else in the Ignited States. Thii
is primarily due to the fact that Ari
zona docs not produce enough agri
cultural products to feed her own peo
ple. Trices of food stuffs in my state
are determined- by the deficiency
which must be imported. An Arizona
farmer is entitled to receive for his
wheat the Kansas price plus the
fr?ight rate. The Kansas farmer re
ceives the Chicago price less the
freight rato. As in all the iniermoun
taiu country, the commodity rales
from the cast are higher than for the
long haul to the Pacific coast. Many
of the copper mines are located on
brain h lines so that the additional
burden of a local late must also be
borne. With all of these disadvan
tages a high rate of wages is impera
tively necessary if the Arizona work
ingmen are to be permitted to main
tain :i decent standard of living.
As I view the silu.ttion, it would Ik
the pan of wisdom for you gentle
men to fix the price of copper at ccr
tr.iuly not less than that for which it
is selling today. If the copper com
panies are making an extraordinary
( profit, congress will soon exact an cx
: cess profits tax which will take a
' large share of it away from them so
I that the government can thus compen
; sate itself. The only way that the
1 mine laborers can be protected is by
abandoning the sliding scale of wages
'and establishing a minimum wage
! based upon the present high cost of
i living in Arizona. If you are able
. to make such an arrangement with,
! the mine owners, a very critical si'
uution will be avoided and a maxi
mum output of copper assured.
In any event, a comparatively high
; price will do more than anything else
to ensure an increasing production of
thu red met;;!. I!y following this plan
new capital can be secured for tho
'development of unwoiked deposits,
and bodies of low grade ores that are
now available will continue to be
mined at a profit.
I understand that the federal trade
commission has furnished you with
data on the cost of producing copper,
but I beg to remind you that the cost
of production is not the only factor
to be considered. A mine is not like
an irrigated farm which grows more
valuable by proper cultivation. A
pound of copper taken from the earth
cannot be used as seed to return a
hundred fold at harvest time. Capital
invested in mining properties, is,
therefore, entitled to large dividend.,
for until all of the costs are first re
paid no additional wealth has been
actually created.
I have presumed to submit these
considerations to you because I rep
resent the state that produces more
copper than any other. The mining
of metal is Arizona's basic industry.
The prosperity of her people depends
almost entirely upon its uninterrupt
ed production. With such a vital in
terest in this question I could not re
train from seeking to counsel with
I yon before the price of copper is final
: ly determined,
i Tours yery truly.

WASHINGTON, Sept. 12. The Lib
erty motor, the airplane engine upon
which the United States is relying to
establish definite air supremacy over
the Germans over the battle-fields of
France, has passed its final test and
is a complete and gratifying success.
Secretary Baker announced today.
Secretary Baker's statement fol
lows: Final Test Passed
"The 'United States Aviation En
gine' has passed its final tests. They
were successful and gratifying The
motor, designated by the signal serv
ice as the 'Liberty Motor, is now
the main reliance of the United States
in the rapid production in large num
bers of high-powered battle-planes for
service in the war. Power, speed,
service, ability and minimum weight,
the new engine invites comparison
with the best that the European war
produced.
Is Big Accomplishment
"I regard the invention and rapia
development of this engine as one
of the really big accomplishments of
the United States since its entry into j
industries have .also contributed the
services of approximately 200 of their
best draftsmen.
"The two engineers promised the
government to. if given an opportuni
ty, they would design a satisfactory
engine before a working model could
be brought from Europe.
Remarkable Speed
"A remarkable American engine was
actually produced three weeks before
any model could have been brought
from Europe. Twenty-eight days after
the drawings were started the new
engine was set up. This was on
July 3.
"With the need for speed as an in
centive, tools for building the first
engine were made even before the
drawings were finished, on the as
sumption that they would be correct.
Parts Turned Out
"Parts of the first engine were
turiied out at twelve different fac
tories, located all the way from Con
necticut to California. When the parts
were assembled the adjustment was
perfect and the performance of the
engine was wonderfully gratifying.
This in itself demonstrates the capa
bilities of American factories when

more than a score of engineers
pooled their skill and trade secrets
in the war emergency, working with

"The story of the production of this
engine is a remarkable one. Prob
ably the war has produced no greater
single achievement.

Composite of Practice
"One of the chief results outlined

Bisbee. although he was a native of
England.
The story of what happened is best
told in Mr. Winslow's own words:
"I arrived at the dam Sunday morn
ing and arranged for a happy dinner
among the officers and their wives,
and then arranged for a motor trip on
the lake in the afternoon. We went
in bathing at 4 o'clock, and at 5 the
motor boat picked us all up in our
bathing suits and we started for a
trip on the beautiful Roosevelt lake.
A happier party never enjoyed the
natural beauties as we did.
"At 6:30 o'clock, we had engine
trouble, and Miss Greniger of Miami
and guest of Lieutenant Grant, grand
son of the famous general, suggested
a dive from the boat. I seconded the
motion and dived off first, she follow
ing, and then Lieutenant Good.
"The wind was blowing, but not
brisk, and the boat was slowly drift
ing. Miss Greniser was swimming
around to the off side and before she
realized it the boat was moving away
from her. Captain Bowker called to
me and said that Miss Greniger was
unable to return to the boat, and I
at once swam to her rescue. I found
that it was impossible to make head
wav and the boat was slowly drift
ing away from us. I called to the
boat for. assistance, and without a
moment's hesitation brave Captain
Bowker plunged in. Of course he
could do no more than I could, and
the boat was still drifting away. They
threw us an oar, whiA was passed to
Miss Greniger; then another, which,
the captain grasped.
"In the meantime Lieutenant Good
got a tiller rope and I thought if 1
could get the rope and one of the
oars I could make a chain w hich would
draw us to Bafety. The rope fell short
and I missed. Again it was tnrown
and I missed it again.
"In my frantic efforts to reach the
rope I was becoming exhausted, and
on the third throw I barely grasped
the end and they drew me to the
boat and hauled me in, and I fell ex
hausted on the cushions. In the mean
time Captain Bowker and Miss Greni
ger were floating in the distance on
the oars. It took perhaps six or sev
en minutes to repair the engine, whicn
was at once started and chugged to
the rescue of the young lady. She
was drawn on board and we at once
turned to the spot where the captain
was last seen. He had disappeared,
and as we chugged up to the spot all
that was seen floating on the water
was the oar, and the brave captain
who -without a moment's hesitation
had gone to the rescue of those in
distress had sunk to the bottom of
Roosevelt lake never to be seen again.
"We patrolled the lake and shores
until it was too late to see and then
returned to the hotel, taking with us
the saddest party that ever visited
the lake.
"Poor Mrs. Bowker was hysterical
and almost beside herself. Lieuten
ant Good at once sounded the alarm.
and all the soldiers at the post start
ed out. in motor boats and automo
biles with searchlights and lanterns
but it was fruitless, and they returned
with the sad news that the captain
was not to be found."
Captain Bowker went to Bisbee
from Washington, D. C. He was a
major In command of the District of
Columbia hospital corps. When the
unit was muFtered out Dr. Bowker
remained in Bisbee and practiced med
icine. He left Bisbee in August and
loined the infantry detachment sta
tioned at Roosevelt dam. Gazette.
Mr. Winslow, who gave the above
story to the Gazette, was in this city
a few weeks ago at the time the Ok;
lHhoma car was stationed at the depot,
and he made a number of friend here
at that time.
LAKE SHIPS WILL
SAIL THE OCEANS
At least 120 ships will leave the
Great Lakes at the end of the present
season of navigation never to return.
The ships will be commandeered or
purchased by the government, for the
Atlantic ocean service. The vessels
so far selected for removal from the
lakes total about 350,000 tons. Forty-
three of the ships are small enough to
pass the Welland canal without alter
ation. Seventy-seven must be cut in
two to pass the locks.
The tonnage now on the lakes totals
about 2,700.000.
The appropriation for purchase of
lake vessels is included in the budget
of $1,134,500,000 submitted to the sec
retary of the treasury by the shipping
board. Of this amount about $140,
000,000 is intended to pay for lake
boats.
The vessels will not be returned to
the lakes, because officials believe
that, allowing for new vessels for lake
service which can be built during the
war, 350,000 tons can be spared from
the lake trade without seriously crip
pling the necessary trade.
SWEDISH BATHS.
STOCKHOLM, Sept. 12. Sweden
has long prided itself on the great
numbpr of public bathhouses it posses
es. They are. Indeed, almost a na
tional institution. Statistics for the
Stockholm public baths for 1916 show
that the habit of taking Finnish,
Turkish, steam, massage 'and plain
tub hatha, all of which are to be had
in these institutions, is confined to a
comparatively limited circle. The to
tal ligure shows only 3 1-5 of such
baths for each inhabitant in the year.
Male patronH outnumbered the women
almost two to one.

this connection the following is quot
ed from the report of the then prison

succeeded by Rev. Mr. Churchill: "Ini
closing, may I repeat the suggestion
of last year, viz: that it be seriously
considered by the management that
the issuance of tobacco in any fjrm
to the inmates of the prison is detri
mental to the men and destructive to
the morals of the institution and
should be discontinued. This sugges
tion comes from a number of the in
mates themselves who wish to rid
themselves of the evil habit."
Fifty-five occupations are repre

NEW YORK FINANCIAL
NEW YORK. Sept. 12 A wave of
selling, in which high grade railroads
and industrials figured conspicuously,
brought about a sharp and general
decline in stocks today. Many issues
went under the low points of the re
cent setback, and in some instances
the lowest price in a number of years
were reported. Trading increased sub
stantially, the total sales amounting
to 811,000.
Although there was no outstanding
feature of the situation to account for
the weakness, the disturbances in
Russia played a considerable part.
Russian bonds suffered a further re
lapse and the rate for rubles was de
pressed abrutply to a new low record
at 11V4 cents, compared with about
52 in normal times. There was a
late recovery to 14 Vi-
Bear traders operated confidential
ly, meeting with light opposition most
of the day.
In the last hour the list rebounded
sharply, regaining a considerable
amount of the ground lost.
Selling was heaviest in Steel, which
for a time was thrown in the market
in large amounts, forcing down the
price three points. Further weakness
appeared in the motors, Reading,
Union Pacific, Delaware and Hudson,
Ixmisville, Canadian Pacific and St
Paul being conspicuously heavy fea
tures on the railroad list. Southren
Railway preferred advanced three
points as the result of a new divi
dend. Bonds were irregular. Total sales,
par value, $3,375,000.
Liberty bonds were stronger at
99.S8 to 99.96.
United States bonds were un
changed on call.
GRAIN MARKETS
CHICAOO, Sept 12. Corn weak
ened in value at the last today, owing
to sympathy with a break in the New
York market The close was heavy,
to net lower, with December
1.17 and May 1.14 to 1.15. Oats
showed a net gain of to Vi- In
provisions the outcome ranged from
60c decline to a rise of 2c.
Depression that prevailed toward
the end of the day in the corn mar
ket had as a basis the fact that liqui
dation is not usually confined to any
one article and that many owners of
stocks were believed to be long on
grain.
Oas developed firmness on account
of continued smallness of receipts
here. Country offerings to arrive were
scanty, and it was said numerous
farmers were holding back on oats
uniil better assured of the safety 3f
corn. Export call for oats was again
in evidence.
Arrivals of wheat proved altogether
too meager to satisfy an urgent de
mand from mills in Chicago and else
where. Flour stocks in distributors'
hands were also said to be very light.
Rapid progress was reported in plow
ing for the next winter crop. Kan
sas advices in particular said the crop
of that state would exceed the 12 per
cent increase requested by the federal
government
Provisions were governed chiefly by
the action of corn.
NEW YORK. Sept. 12. The list
yielded to the weakness in high grade
investment shares and the standard
rails. Seemingly there has been in
progress of late much selling by insti
tutions and investors of the higher
type of securities in order to make
preparations for subscriptions to the
forthcoming installment of the Lib
erty loan. In addition, much nervous
ness has been provoked in nearly all
circles on account of the delay in the
announcement of the price to be fixed
on steel products and copper metal,
and also over1 the Russian affairs.
These fatcors, combined with the dif
ficulty that many corporations are ex
periencing in financing their require
ments, or at least the high cost of
money procured for corporate pur
poses at this time quite naturally have
had much to do with undermining
confidence in the stability of the ex
isting order of things, more especially
as it has become from a stock market
viewpoint apparently a question of
prices rather than equity of earnings.
Several large shorts were credited
with having covered substantial short
lines on the decline which served to
impart a firmer tone to the market

I SWIMS 27 MILES
IN FRESH WATER
Joseph P. Gunther.
Joseph P. Gunther of Charleston,
W. Va, recently accomplished the
feat of swimming; twenty-seven
miles in fresh water in a little over
sixteen hours. Better records have
been made by swimmers in sea
water, but a fresh water, swim is
much harder than one in the salt sea.
SENATE CONSIDERS
WAR CREDITS BILL
(By Review Leased Wire)
WASHINGTON, Sept. 12. The
three hours today Secretary McAdoo
explained to the senate finance com
mittee the necessities for the eleven
billion dollar war credit bill passed
last week by the house. He did not
conclude and tomorrow wiil complete
his statement, previously given to the
house ways and means committee.
Will Report Tnursday
The senate commlztee hopes to com
plete the biil tomorrow and will re
port it Thursday to the senate, where
it will be given the right of way over
all other legislation.
Closely Questioned
Secretary McAdoo was closely ques
tioned by committee members, but it
was said here, no Qpposi.ion develop
ed. It is believed the bill can be
passed after minor committee changes
are made with comparatively brief de
bate. To Meet Emergency
Secretary McAdoo said that all of
the $4,000,000,000 new bonds proposed
in the biil for loans to the allies will
not be needed, but that it was desired
to make the amount ample to meet
any emergency.
Maximum Interest
The new maximum interest rate of
4 per cent authorized In the bill for
the new bonds appeared to meet with
general approval, but some committee
men expressed doubt of the wisdom of
the convertibility proposal and also of
the taxation authorized.
As soon as supplies are received the
Great Western Film company, now
settled In Elysian Grove at Tucson,
will begin to "shoot," it was an
nounced by the company yesterday.
The supplies are awaited from Albert
Steinfeld & Company. The company
is awaiting notice at Los Angeles to
start for Tucson.
