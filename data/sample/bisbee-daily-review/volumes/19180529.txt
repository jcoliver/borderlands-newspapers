WASHINGTON, May 2S. Congress
tonight apparently had found a way
to provide the war revenue legislation
insisted upon by President Wilson
without hbandoning entirely its long
cherished plan to get out of Washing
ton for a summer vacation.
Leaders of both parties joined in
conferences and approved a program
that promises prompt action on the
presentation ot pending bills to be fol
lowed about June 15 or 20 by a recess
of both houses until August, while the
ways ani means coimitees frame the
revenue bill. After passage of the
measure by the house, probably about ! tne Gern)an advance on the heignts
August 10th the house would recess Neuvllle-Sur-Margival and Yreg

senate.
The plan will b seubmitted to the
ways and means committees tonio
row. The democrats of the commit
tee probably .will frame a tentative
draft upon which the entire member
ship will build the bill after hearings
lasting a fortnight or more.

Significant
Results of city elections held in all the
more important of the industrial centers of
the state Monday, indicate a return of the
voters to a safe and sane political system,
as well as a manifestation of most intense
loyalty and patriotism. While patriotism
was the issue in such cities as Biobee: Je
rome and Globe, yet the men elected on
that platform were of the same and conser
vative type, while their opponents general
ly were of the radical agitator type.
The overwhelming defeat of all these
radicals in these industrial centers could
not have been accomplished without the
aid of the workingmen generally and union
men at the ballot boxes. Therefore, the
returns are all the more significant. They
mark a turn in affairs. The days of the
waving of the bloody shirt of radicalism are
fast passing in this state. The radical and
the agitator and the trouble maker are on
their last legs. They can no more make
political capital out of their wild attacks
upon the "copper barons" and their unsel
fish support of the poor workingman. They
must have something concrete upon which
to base their attacks, and they must have
a record of either accomplishment cr abili
ty or construction behind their support.
General terms and assertions will not do.
The war has knitted the best men and
women in this state together as never had
been dreamed of before. When the rich
and the poor and the laborer and the busi
ness man work side by side day after day
in a common cause of country they begin
to find out something about each other. .
They begin to think and to reason and to
act along broader, finer, fairer lines. And
in this great work the real patriots are dis
covered. The real state and home and
business builders and worth while folks be
gin to sort the sheep from the goats. In
time of war men who love their country
and have a pride in its institutions and su
preme efforts in a supreme crisis naturally
get together upon common ground, and
men who lack these high ideals and solid
foundations of citizenship naturally herd
together. They brand themselves by their
acts so plainly that their empty and mean
ingless words and assertions can no longer
cover them with garments of respectability.
The war marks the passing of the rabble
rouser and cheap and selfish politician.
Soon there will come a time when 'nothing
much will count but what one is doing for
his country. Soon will come a time when
hundreds of thousands of the boys will
come back from over there and they and
their millions of relations and friends will
cast the deciding vote at all elections upon
a patriotism issue of accomplishment only.
Soldiers who faced German steel will be
elected to office. And their experiences in
a stern and terrible game will . have made
them, thoughtful and broad and fair and
able to administer affairs upon a big basis.
War is a stern test of manhood. It wipes
out class hatred and differences with an
impatient and implacable hand and sorts
real men together and throws the dross up
on one side where all may see it in its cheap
and worthless nakedness.
A new yard stick is being made with
which to measure the politician and the
office seeker, and it is a stick that only a
real man may abide and come up to the
standard. The shcuter will fall far short
Capitalists have other things to think of
and to do these days besides merely making
money. They must dig down deep for a
dozen different kinds of war work funds
and taxes every month. Workingmen have
other things to think of than the empty
mouthings of the agitator. All good union
men are enlisted in a higher cause than a
labor union, It is the union of humanity
under a supreme test. And out of the war
will come a stronger and yet a more toler
ant lot of capitalists and workingmen to
take up again and carry on the industrial
needs and burdens of the nation.
Mark weil the signs of the times. They
all point the same way. And the Arizona
municipal elections of last Monday are
signs of better times ahead for the young
state.
A "WOB3LY" DEFENSE AND A
WOBBLY PURPOSE.
(Phoenix Gazette)
"Crimes have been committed in Arizo

W. W.
Quoting the above from an article which
appeared in the New York Evening Post,
Gov. Hunt makes use of it in his first mes
sage to the special session of the third legis
lature to defend that outlaw organization.
Having found one quotation so pat for
his purpose, the governor follows with an
other which he attempts to make serve, and
in doing so he offers an insult to the honest
and patriotic labor which is not identified
with the I. W. W. and to these labor organ
izations 3ffiliated with the American Fed
eration of Labor and which denounce the
I. W. W. and prohibit the members from
that outlaw organization belonging to the
affiliated unions.
"Labor of America," quotes the gover
nor from John R. Lawson, of Colorado,
who is dating labor's position during the
war, "will stand solidly behind the presi

from the earth. Labor in America will lead
the world in its devotion and sacrifice to
flag and country, and labor in Colorado
will stand second to none in America."
Noble sentiments and splendidly spoken,
yet can they by any stretch of imagination
be attributed to the I. W. W. or to repre
sent the feelings of a single adherent to the
tenets cf that traitorous organization ? Yet
the governor glibly passes from one to the
other in his counsel to the legislators. Hon
est and honorable labor, such as Lawson is
speaking for, will resent being coupled
with a class recognized as being criminal in
purpose and cruel in act. By no juggling
of phrases, with which the message
abounds, can the governor incite sympathy
for the outcasts and his purpose in reading
into the record of the legislature matter
that can have no possible connection with
the purpose for which it was called is all
too apparent.
The merits of the deportation at Bisbee
are not matters for public discussion at this
time, when the federal court has for trial a
score cr more of indictments as the out
come of that affair. The governor pro
ceeds to try these cases before the legislat
ure and to render a verdict. This message
of the governor is to be given wide circu
lation among the electorate of this state,
from which is to be secured a jury to try
these cases. The message of the governor
disposes of any necessity for consideration
by this jury. The findings are there in the
message.
But there are other indictments, brought
by a federal jury outside of this state, for
which a jury has been secured, and they
are now being tried. These are more than
100 members of the I. W. W. brought to
bar in Chicago for trial before Judge Ken
esaw Mountain Landis, charged with con
spiracy against the government of the Un
ited States and various crimes of sabotage.
A number of these defendants in the Chica
go trial were taken in Arizona, where they
had been living for some time past and
during the time specified in the indict
ments. We will await with interest the verdict
of this Chicago jury and then we will know
if "crimes have been committed in Arizo
na, but they are not chargeable to the I.
W. W."
The United States fuel administration an
nounces the first week in June as "Early
Buying" week, when extensive efforts will
be made to have all coal consumers, not al
ready having done so, place their orders for
the year's supply. While the record of coal
orders is quite satifactory to the fuel ad
ministration, it is particularly desirous that
coal ordering reach 100 per cent with the
close of "Early Buying" week. State and
county and local fuel administrators in the
various communities of the country will
arrange for the community demonstrations,
programs of which will be announced in ad
vance. While the fuel administration is not
in position to assure the people a full supply
of coal during the coming season, there is
reason to hope for considerable increase of
production and better facilities for distribu
tion than in the preceding year.

Open Letter to
Governor Hunt
The Hon. G. V. P. Hunt,
Governor of Arizona,
Phoenix. Arizona.
My Dear Gov. Hunt:
In your message to the Special Ses
sion of the Third State Legislature.
Phoenix, 21st May, after depicting in
scathing terras the Bisbee deporta
tions, wherein you express with char
acteristic vehemence your abhorrence
of what you term to be one of the most
revolting crimes ever committed in
'he state, you ask, "Can this dastardly
"iuie over be equalled in the revolt
ing annals of Ameitcan labor jlis
putes?" I take up your challenge and
answer, "Yes, in this very state and
during your own benign administra
tion." As I read your harrowing descrip
tion of the events of the 12th day of
July, 1917, an analogous, although
more terrible, picture arose before my
mind, to which your own words might
as fittingly be applied.
The events connected with the labor
dispute in the Clifton-Morenci district
during the winter of 1915-1916 are still
fresh in the minds of the people of
this state. To some of the horrors I
may freely and fittingly apply your
own descriptive words.
During these awful months not only
sco:es but hundreds of men, innocent
of any intention to disturb the peace
ful conditions of the communities in
which they were living, men against
whom no charge could be preferred
except that they refused to be intimi
dated into joining a labor organization
with whose methods they were not in
sympathy, were forcibly expelled from
tl:is district.
Picture the spectacle afforded - by
the-r? deportations. Mcbs (I use the
word advisedly) under Hie eyes of the
very effirers charged with the main
tenance of peace and order in the
county, and whose sworn duty it was
to suppress such lawlessness, organ
ised, not as mobs are wont to do un
der the spur of justifiable indignation
rf self righteous anger, but with Indian-like
stealth under the cover of
darkness, premetiitatedly, deliberately
and swocped down upon the homes
cf unsur.pecting, unoffending miners
who had made no violence, yea. more,
who had threatened no violence, but
v.'io ''ad every lawful reason to feel
secure as citizens under the guaran-tt.'(.-i
vouchsafed by the Constitution of
the United States and the State of
Arizona. By sheer force of arms and
cf rocks and clubs and tin cans, this
conscienceless mob of organized fan-
atits apparently immune from arrest
cr punishment, violated at one and the
sr.aie time the sacred tenets of our
Republic, and the sanctuary of the
American home. With all the brutish
abandon cf the unconscionable Hun
they dragged husbands out of their
wives' embrace, ruthlessly disengaged
the arms of little terrified children
fn.m about their fathers' necks, thrust
mothers and sons apart, and offered
coarse insults to the wives and daugh
ters cf honest working men. In this
execrable manner, without a vestise
of justification or legality, many hun
dreds cf unarmed working men were
driven at the point of gun or piRe or
by threats of violence from their
.''omes, many of them beaten up and
spat upon, their clothes torn, and
bruised and bleeding, compelled to
walk hatless and shoeless under the
blazing Arizona sun without food or
water (how different to the case of
the I. W. W's who were provided with
free transportation and an ample sup
ply of food and water) until after
many miles of agony they were a"31e
to reach the sheltering arms of a com
munity whose manly independent Am
erican citizenry received them and as
sured them that there at all events
they would be guaranteed the right to
live in peace and quietness, of which
these mobs had deprived them; and
as can be readily imagined, the reali
zation that their mothers, wives and
daughters were left in Morenci at the
mercy of their ruffian captors did not
serve to assuage their anguish. So
f'at what you term "this dastardly
crime" had already been equalled in
this district, in your own day and time.
It is not necessary to accept as cor
rect my recital of these doings. The
facts, which are not exaggerated, can
be verified by many reputable citizens
who remained in the district through
out those terrifying months, unparal
leled in the history of this state, by
sworn statements of scores of victims
end otherwise. At the time these oc
currences were given the fullest pub
licity and you were publicly asked by
one of Arizona's most Jionorahlo and
independent citizens in a letter to the
press the following question:
"Is it true. Governor, that a large
number of law abiding, inoffensive
men. who resided in tne Clifton-Mor-encl
district with their families and
themselves, were unlawfully and un
mercifully beaten and inhumanly
abused and forcibly compelled to aban
don their families, homes and proper
ty and flee from the Clifton-Morein-1
district and seek refuge in the neigh
boring town of Duncan, without em
ployment, homeless refugees?
"If this bo true. Governor common
public rumor says it is true permit
mo u-ith ull roumift tfl usk wlml villi.
aa f'iif niupiefruto it the Ktuti under
ycur solemn oath of office, to which
you refer in your statement, have done
olt'icially or otherwise, to protect
these injured people in their sacred
rights of life, liberty and the pursuit
of happiness, and to restore them to
their homes, families and properties.
II they are not lawbreakers, why are i
thrv unlawfully compelled to be refu
gees under ycur administration of the
laws cf Arizona? Is not the refugee
camp at Duncan a greater reflection
on your administration than anything
your traducers in the state can say or
do?"
And what answer did you make?
lOcho answers "what?"
It is true that these iniquities, which
your language depicts with such Hau
te lil.e realism, were not brought Into
Mich iiiilinnal prominence us that to
which yen refer, not because they did
not deserve it, but because of tile pe
ncil imr ! , 1 1 ! i these lit invitation-,
were spread and because the number
of victims in each case to captors was
relatively small and the victims were
as a rule not lawyers of notoriety,
Socialists or able-bodied malcontents
with votes in their pockets, but poor,
helpless and friendless Mexicans,
whose very right to live appeared to
be questioned under the mob law ob
taining in the county at that time, al
though i.iany of them had been living
in the district for over twenty years
in peace and quietness, earning an
honest livelihood.
It is also a fact that the entire dis
trict was captured and held by an or
ganized gang of thugs and gunmen, to
use your favorite expression, who,
without semblance of law restrained
peaceable citizens from coming into
or leaving the district without their
permission, who molested people going
about their lawful business, who way
laid in the dark those whom they had
reason to believe were out of sympa
thy with them and beat them up or
otherwise terrorized them; one man
being taken from his home, tied in a
chair, a rope put around his neck till
he was nearly strangled, was jabbed
in the body with knives and was dis
covered three days later wandering
over the hills in a half crazed condi
tion. These and many other such
atrocities were committed, which are
matters of record and make one blush
for the fair name of Arizona. You
were Governor of Arizona at that time
and you may very properly be a'sKed
why ycu did not put a stop to the per
petration of such outrages, at a time
when the police powers of your ad
ministration were recruited to their
fullest, instantly availably and power
ful within the most plenary scope oi
the laws of this state?
And, Governor, the excuse jvjis even
denied you that the telegraph wires
were cut. and that you could not know
that such things were going on. Wide
ly different were the circumstances,
for time and time again were these
outrageous proceedings brought to
your notice, but with what result? An
inquiry through your own henchmen,
perhaps, and the world was anured
by you that all was peace ar.d quiet
ness, but were it possible to rcll into
one the ninety days in 1915, durin;
which your brand of peace "raced" in
the Clifton-Morenci district, the atroci
ties committed at Bisbee on July 12th
last would pale into utter insignifi
cance in comparison, and it is signifi
cant that the very officer w'io, while
in direct communication with you per
sonally and by wire all the time, was
responsible for the enforcement of all
state and federal rights during the
continuance of the.-e conditions of
savar.cry, is today receiving prefer
ment at your hands.
I would iildo ask you why you did
not go before the Third State Legis
lature on January Sth, 1917, and in the
clarion tones of your present message
let fall your righteous indignation up
on the perpetrators of these outrages
whi. h had but a short time previously
shocked and disgusted all true lovers
of liberty and whic h had made so sor
ry a blot upon the pages of tlie history
of this state; was it because it was
not your ox that was being gored?
Had you then defended the right
against the wrong, the cause ot the
weak against his oppressor, your sin
cerity could not now be called in ques
tion nor your consistency ir.pu: ned.
Tiie public of Ar.iomi ,iave not saicii
shr.rt memories that tuese doni'tb have
plready been fcrgo'ti n. and it v. iuld
seem to me that the intelligent por
tion of the community will feel in
view of your failure to maintain the
peace of this neighborhood, so gonly
outraged, and if your failure to pro
test the illegal deportations which
were being continuously and systemat
ically carried out during that p nod
under the very nose of your own offi
cers, and miiit'a whose presence was
mere camouflage. inconceivROly with
out your knowledge, t.'.iut silence would
have been golden in the present in
stance. Your message scintilates with patri
otic utterances, commendable in the
highest degree. They should be en
dorsed and applauded by every loyal
hearted citizen In r;zoua. and they
will certainly read well in Washing

that Arizona should not he made a

and class, you were to ho'.d the scales

The Farmer's Share
Live stock is marketed from farmer to
consumer at a lower cost than almost
any other farm product
The United States Department of Agriculture
reported in 1916 that , the farmer gets for his cattle
"approximately two-thirds to three-fourths" of the
final retail price paid by the consumer for the
resulting beef.
Under normal conditions, the farmer's share of
retail prices of various farm products is approx-
imately as follows:
Butter 71 percent
CATTLE 6623 to 75 per cent
Eggs 65 per cent
Potatoes 55 per cent
Poultry 45 per cent
Fruits 35 per cent
The difference between farmer's price and retail
price represents the necessary expenses of packing,
freight and wholesale and retail distribution.
Swift & Company not only performs the manufac
turing operations of preparing cattle for market in
its well-equipped packing plants, but it pays the
, freight on meat to all parts of the United States,
operates 500 branch distributing houses, and in most
cases even delivers to the retail butcher. All this
is done at an expense of less than 2 cents per
pound, and at a profit of only about of a cent
per pound of beefl
Large volume of business and expert manage
ment, make possible this indispensable service to the
live-stock raiser and to the consumer, and make
possible the large proportion of retail prices received
by farmers.

were the sharply defined features of
today's active but unstable stock mar
ket. These divergent movements were re
garded as the direct result of such
recent developmnts as th railroad rate
increase and the government s pro
posed taaxation program, the latte
bearing most heavily upon war shares
and kindred issues.
Over all. however, hung the for
eign situation, bulletins from the west

scattered liquidation and giving fur
ther encouragemeut to the short in
terests. Selling was at its height just before
noon, then steels, equipments and
speculative issues as a whole reacted
2 to 5 points, Sumatra tobacco making
a sheer descent of almost 11 points.
On the increased activity of the
last hour prices rallied sharply, in
some instances shewing actual gains
as against the severe reversals of the
forenoon.

Krebs said that it should be impressed
upon the minds of those who have be

register last year because they did not
realize the seriousness attached to

Krebs said, "and for that reason, the
government did not In all cases give
the full penalty imposed by the law
for those who did not register. Now,
however, it is different. The men who

COL23 SAGE TEA
INTO GRAY HAIR
Darken Beautifully and Re
tore It Natural Color and
Lustre at Once.
Common garden sago brewed into'
a heavy tea, with sudphur and alcohol
added, will turn gray, streaked and
faded hair beautifully dark and luxur
iant. Mixing the Sage Tea and Sul
phur recipe at home, though, is trou-!
blesome. An easier way is to get the
ready-to-use preparation, improved by)
the addition of other ingredients, a
large bottle, at little cost, at drug
stores, known as '"Wyeth's Sage and
Sulphur Compound," thus avoiding a
lot of muss. ;
While gray, faded hair is not sinful, j
we all desire to retain our youthful
appearance and attractiveness. By
"arkening your hair with Wyeth's Sage
and Sulphur Compound, no one can
tell, because it does it so naturally,
so evenly. You just dampen a sponge
or soft brush with It and draw this
through your hair, taking one small
strand at a time; by morning all gray,
hairs have disappeared. After another j
application or two your hair becomes1
beautifully dark, glossy, soft and lux
uriant and you appear years pounger.
Wyeth's Sae and Sulphur Compound
is a delightful toilet requisite. It ia
not intended for the care, mitigation
or prevention of disease. Adv. i

ENGINEER'S WIFE LAYS
HER CROTCHES ASIDE
P. G. Hooks Spent $2,000
Trying to Restore His
Wife' Health Gains
16 Lbs. on Tanlac
Another wonderful endorsement for
Tanlac that will be read with inter -
est by thousands of frail, suffering
women throughout the south, was
given recently by Mrs. Elizabeth
Hooks, of Rome, Ga. Mrs. Hooks is!
., ., , ... ,, ,
the wifo ol P. G. Hooks, a well known
'""'""u biiict:i. .-us.
Hooks made the reinakabie statement
that she had icceived more benetit
from four battles of Tanlac than from
medical treatment that had cost her
husband J-.UUO, which he had paid out
in the past two years in an eifort to
restore her health.
"For about two years," said .Mrs.
Hook, "I have been in very bad health
and have suffered from stomach
trouble, extreme nervousness and a
a bad form of rheumatism. For mora
than seven months I was confined to
my bed und was almost a nervous and
physical wreck. My digestion was so
poor, I had to diet myself and rarely'
ate anything but soft boiled eg.es and
milk and things of that kind, and even
the lightest of foods would nauseate

I "My condition became so bad, my

I weighed eighty-nine pounds just a

trial. I did this because of what 1 j

"That was the best resolution of my j

"I have set my crutches aside and

my husband a few days ago I be

he insisted that I wait a while.
"I now weigh one hundred and five
pounds, which is a gain of sixteen j
pounds, and am improving right alons i
every day. Before taking Tanlac I was
so weak and frail I was greatly dis-
couraged and could not persvnde my-i
self to believe that I would ever be
able to enjoy another well day. But
i don't Tee! that way now. I am not
nervous like I was, and I can see find .
feel a great improvement. I sleep bet-,
ter and my strength is returning rap- i
