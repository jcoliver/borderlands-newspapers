Huns Are Repulsed
' The sillied defens-3 on the Flanders
fiont to the southwest of Ypres has
again been tested by the Germans and
has been found adequate. Two divis
ions ot Teutonic troops were employed
on a relatively short front and were
sent into the fight under cover of a
ttirific srtillery fire. The front chosen
for the attack extended from the vil
lage of Voormezeele, but the center of
i be assault seemed to have lreen at
ierstmat, a hamlet northeast of Kem
mel Hul.
The flanks of the German attacking
line were stopped short by fii-3 from
the FrencL and British artillery posted
on high ground and which was able
to enlilade the German regiments as
they tried to advance. In the center,
howevel , the Germans made quite a
terious dent in the allied line. Wed
nesday night, however, tin allies drove
forward in a counter attack, and the
latest icports from Field Marshal
Haig are to the effect that the line
lias been icsstablished. The Ger
mans are reported to have lost very
turiK e fighting.

and peers galleries also were thronged.
Immediately aftr the introduction
of Mr. A.quith's motion the premier
took the floor and spoke in defense of
; the government. He refuted the
charges of eGneral Maurice and de
clared that statements- made in his
recent speech, to which Maurices'
charges referred, were made on infor
mation veceived from General Maur
ice's department of th- war office. He
showed also by documentary evidence
that the extension of the British line
was made because of pressure exerted
by France, and that the decision was
taken on the advice of the military au
thorities', in agreement with Field
Marshal Haig. the war cabinet haT
ing inte'fered in no way in the matter.
it approved of the disposi-
tions.
With reference to the strength of
the army, the premier said:
"There is absolutely no doubt that
there i? a very considerable addi
tion to the man power of the army at
the beginning of 191S. as compared
with tlv man powei. at the beginning
of 1917. in France.

BY REVIEW
NEW YORK, May 9. Another spec
tacular movement In Industrials and
war issues vhich lifted United States
Steel points above its low price
of the morning to the new maximum
of 107. its highest quotation in over
six months, was the impressive fea
ture of today's very active stock mar
ket. Prices were irregular at the outset,
Steel and Reading, the market's ac
knowledged leaders, displaying mod
erate heaviness on war bulletins which
prompted scattered selling.
Accumulation of steel in the last
lour was on a scale seldom equaled,
except in the boom markets of the
first two years of the war. its coniri
bution to the day's total operationn of
about 1,100,000 shares was no less
than 33 per cent.
High grade rails were at their best
in the final dealings, Canadian Pa
ciflc gaining 4 and Union Pacific
Bonds were ignored and slightly irreg
ular, including Liberty issues. Total
sales (par value)$3,7f:5,000. United
States, old Issues, were unchanged on
call.
GRAINS
CHICAGO, May 9. Prospects of
freezing temperatures that might seri
ously hinder planting brought about
advances ia the corn market. Prices
closed nervous at the same as yes
terday's finish to 1M cent higher with
May 1.21V. and July 1.47 to 1.47.
Oats gained cents to 2 cents
net. The outcome in provisions was
a set back of 2 to 12 cents.
A falling off in primary receipts
tended to handicap the bears. Offer
ings were light throughout the ses
sion and were at no time sufficient to
cause any important reaction. Most
of the demand came from shorts, and
during the last hour May delivery
commanded the highest price reacheu
so far on the crop.
Oats advanced as a result of frost
Indications. Gossip .of a revival of
export demand could not be confirmed.
Provisions rose with grain but on
the bulge offerings increased and a
decline followed, notwithstanding a
later upturn In hog values and despite
increased shipments of lard and meats,
as compared with last year.

Experience
"If I had all the money today, that

"Seven years ago," she continued,
"I was well and strong as anybody,
when a complication of troubles set in
that finally, about a year ago. brought
me under tin surgeon's knife. The
operation left me so weak and run
down that my condition became alarm

pressed so on my heart that I flt like
HI would smother to death. I was
rervous and restless at night and lost
so much sleep that by morning I was
dull and heavy and hardly had enough
energy to get out of bed for a week
at a time. I suffered from spells of
dizziness, my head would ache till I
thought I would go distracted, and I
felt so miserable I was afraid I'd never
be fit for anything a;ain.
"Some of my friends had b?en bene
fitted by Tanlac and advised me to
try it. sent for a bottle, and before
I had taken many doses of this medi

disappeared. My appetite has re
turned new, and I can eat hot bis

things I've had to shun for years. My
nerves are now steady, I sleep like a

GERMAN POLICY LAID BARE
Dr. Ludwig KSarlsruhe, member of the
German reichstag, has written the Tage-
blatt to warn Germany against the Brest
Litovsk peace as a breeder of fierce wars
yet to come. He declares that the present
German policy ' towards Russia will excite
a deep seated hatred between the nations
that will never cease until drenched in
blood again. German's domination of the
rich Baltic states is especially lamented by
this reichstag member and he points oat
fearlessly the folly of the present headlong
Prussian conquest of alien peoples.
In this same connection might be quot
ed the words of Wilhelm the First, father
of the present kaiser, who stated with sar
donic and arrogant frankness the real rea
sons why Germany seized Alsace-Lorraine
after the Franco-Prussian war. Wilhelm I
said : '
'"After having made immense sacrifices
for her defense, Germany wishes to be cer
tain that the next war will find her better
prepared to throw back the attack which
she may expect as soon as France has re
made her strength and acquired allies. It is
this sorrowful motive alone and not the de
sire to aggrandize a country and territory
which is big enough which forces me o in
sist upon territorial cessions which have no
other object but that of pushing further
back the starting point on the French arm
ies which will come to attack us in the fu
ture." Nothing here about Alsace-Lorraine be
ing German land and German blood. It
was just a case of war plunder of defense
less peoples. Germany has already practi
cally annexed the cream of Russian prov
inces in the same manner and for the same
reasons. She would extend her borders
against Russia proper. She would weaken
or dominate all peoples, strengthening her
self at the same time. And so sure of her
own strength is she, that she does not take
the trouble to keep the mask of a policy or
excuse upon her face much more than half
the time. Her final word in all conferences,
no matter how fair and soft she speaks at
first, is, "Might is Right!"
It is easy to misinterpret Secretary
Baker's recent declaration about the num
ber of American troops in France and it is
dangerous to speculate upon it, so what is a
poor newspaper man to do? Cautiously
feeling his way, however, he may go thus
fai'. The secretary said we had sent over a
half million men SINCE THE FIRST OF
THE YEAR. Therefore this does not in
clude the men we sent last year, the regu
lars and the Rainbow divisions and the na
tional guard and engineers and marines.
We may have three-quarters of a million
men over there ; we may not. But we cer
tainly have many more than half a million.
There is every reason to believe that we
will have a million before fall. And, by all
the gods of war! they are needed over there.
Let all patriots rejoice, for we hsXc
war activities booked for the Warren dis
trict. Lieut. Paul Perigord of the French
army, a hero of the Marne and who wears
the Croix de Guerre, is coming next Satur
day and Sunday for public addresses, and
then on May 20 the big Red Cross drive be
gins. Bisbee, with more than a million
subscribed to the third Liberty loan, will
greet her distinguished visitor with pride
and honor, and she will take off her coat to
work for the Red Cross. No half way meas
ures in the mile high town.
Two German sympathizers who made
disloyal remarks on Pennsylvania avenue
in Washington City were only saved from
the mob by the prompt action of the po
lice. Pennsylvania avenue is supposed to
be about the centre of law and order in the
country, but the temper of the people is at
white heat these days, after three years of
patience under the poison bitterness of a
swarm of German spies and agents, and
disloyalty is being dealt with summarily
out of hand. Mob violence is always to be
deplored, but prompt and decisive action of
citizens generally in the presence of dis
loyalty will go far towards throttling this
insidious propaganda that is being carried
on in every community in the nation. No
good citizen can afford to remain quiet be
fore disloyal statements ofany kind. It i3
out duty at home to act promptly in cases
like this just as much as it is the duty of our
soldiers to carry out orders with dash and
promptness on the battle line.
THE CASE OF CROAFF
Douglas International : It is learned
that the State Council of Defense expects
to issue call at an early date for another
meeting at which the matter of asking the
resignation of T. J. Croaf f will be advanced
as the principal business to be transacted.
Croaff since a member of the Council
of Defense has been the head of the labor
committee. At the same time he has been
president of the Arizona Federation of La
bor and editor of a radical labor journal.
The violence .of the latter has been such as
to cause its repudiation by all conservative
labor in the federation, within which the
Croaff policies are not endorsed by the ma
jority, as was demonstrated in the over
whelming rejection in the state of his pro
posal of a May I strike.
In spite of his violence and strong so
cialistic, if not anarchistic, attitude, Croaff
has been permitted to run along as he
pleased in the Council of Defense and at
times has appeared to exercise more or less
domination. His removal from the body is
said to have come to appear to be necessary
in the eyes of a great many loyal citteens
and recognition of this fact was supposed
to have occasioned the called meeting of
last Saturday, in which Cairman Heard's
introduction of the Hunt letter appears to
have coupled Croaff and the governor and
side-tracked the original purpose.
' In a letter to Chairman Heard this week,
Editor Jaynes has demanded that the coun
cil cf Defense do not ally itself with Gov
ernor Hunt through action upon his letter
but require of the" governor that he go in
court and prove his case ju3t as any other
citizen would be obliged to do. In view of
this it is considered that the pending call
for a meeting of the Council of Defense to
consider the Croaff matter will make it
plain that it will come up unencumbered
by extraneous issues.
War tries men's souls. There never was
a national leader of a free nation who stood
unassailcd through a war. Our Washing
ton and Lincoln were attacked upon every
side at times and criticized most bitterly by
many people. Kitchener, the idol of Eng
land, received more than his share before
he started on the ill fated trip to Russia
that cost him his life. Lloyd George, the
great British premier, has, up to the pres
ent time, stood so high above the ruck in'
talent and tact that his rule was( singularly
free from complaint. But now his turn
has come. The dismissal of Gen. Maurice
brought on the storm. This turmoil in
British politics going on right now is about
as bad as the rout of an army. It hurts.
Partisanship always hurts when a nation is
under the stress of war. Our own Presi
dent Wilson has had from the start the al
most united support of all parties and
classes in the prosecution of the war. A
political faction in a free land engaged in
a death struggle with autocracy simply em
phasizes the claim of the autocrats that
theirs is the best form of government. This
column has always admired Lloyd George
immensely and believes he will withstand
the storm with an unblemished shield.
Gen. Maurice is also a great man, but right
now he is smarting under wrongs and in
justice, real or fancied, and this fact must
be considered in connection with any
charges he may make against the English
premier.
Reports from Austria indicate a crisis
in that unhappy monarchy. But then ihey
have had so many crises in Austria since
the beginning of the war that no well bal
anced war observer pays much attention
to them any more. However, there is no
doubt but that Austria is in a bad way. Her
punch has gone. She has held up better
than Russia, the weak sister of the entente,
but even Russia beat Austria two years ago
and was only diverted from overrunning
the country by the German drive under:
Mackenson. Austria has probably a mil
lion troops or more facing Italy and Aus
trian cannon and shells are playing an im
portant part on the western front right now.
Only a revolution can wrest Austria from
the control of Berlin and that is a most un
likely and improbable event.

Serving in a World atWar
7 We are doing our titmoat to serve the public m satisfactorily today as
as we did before the war upset the commercial worlds
'. In the face of greatly increased eosta of material we are endeavoring to
maintain our plant at the highest point of efficiency.
Despite the high cost of labor, we are maintaining full crews that there
may be no part of the work slighted or neglected.
"While the demands of the signal service of our armies have deprived us
of many technically trained men, those who remain have spread out to iS
the gaps by extra effort.
In some places congestion has occurred because we have been unable to
secure equipment for relief, but in such cases the traffic is being handled to
the full extent of human ability.-
With the world rocking under the weight of war; with economic condi
tions unsettled and abnormal, we are striving always to coordinate our ef
forts to the great problems involved in the winning of the war.
We feel that uninterrupted, efficient telephone service is playing a con
spicuous part in the forces that will bring ultimate victory.

PONT A GRESSON IS
TAKEN BY TOMMIES
IN BAYONET CHARGE
"Pont a Crssson, strategic "point in
the alius' drive, taken from the Ger
mans in tierce bayonet charge." This
is what the headlines in the daily
tapirs flashed to the millions of in
tei'flstod readers all over the world but
little did they guess the tragedy that
lay in those tew words. How a French
man's hcr.rt was breaking because he
had not !ieen able to strike a blow in
(intense ot his birthplace, or how, in
another corner of the world, a white
faced wiMian waited for news of her
min. or.ee a slacker, who hud led the
heroic charge of the British Tommies
"ever the top."
Had tlii' Frenchman, a little de
signer in New York, known the part
he hat, played, miles away from all
danger, in the deliverance of his be
loved birthplace, he would have been
transformed with happiness. But the
hand o' destiny had played its pari
in this aliled victory, chosing for its
iiibtrunuiit a gown designed by this
sa:ne grieved little Frenchau. It is
this element of surprise which makes
the neu Triangle release, "The Gown
of Destiny" at the Orpheum theater
today, tht most appealing and intense
ly interesting screen dramas of the
present day. Alma Rubens is starred
in his producction, supported by Walt
Whitman. J. Barney Sherry, Allan
Sears and others.

CHARLES RAY TODAY
AT CENTRAL THEATER
Five years ago Charles Ray, who
will be seen at the Central theater
today in "The Son of His Father." a
Paramount production, was a member
of an unimportant musical comedy in
the far west. Today he is one of the
recognized stars of the cinema world.
His newest photodrama gives to
this young a:-tor splendid opportuni
ties for effective portrayal of an in
teresting character. He is seen as
the son of a New York railroid mag
nate, who. with $5,000 dollars, sets out
to prove to his fcther that he pos
sesses enough inherent husiness auii-
ity to make a hundred thousand dol
lars in six months. He makes good.
defeating his father in a contest of
j business wits, and finding happiness
; in the love of a very charming girl
of the west. In fact, he proves in
I every way that he is the "son of his
! father."
It is a role very much to Ray s
liking, and he brings to it the pleas
ing personality, the boyish enthusiasm,
and the recognized genius for screen
acting that have made him a favorito
everywhere.
