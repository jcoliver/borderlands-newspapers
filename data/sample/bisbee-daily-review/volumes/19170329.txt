(By Review Leased Wire)
WASHINGTON, Mar. 28. The
number of national guardsmen
called into the federal service for
policing industrial and other
strategic points was brought up
to 50,000 under orders issued to-'
day.
At the same time the regular force
of engineers, scattered along the Mex-
ican border, was ordered back to its
barracks at the capital, the navy took
additional measures to hasten con
struction and equipment of fighting
ships and both the war and navy de
partments announced further provis
ions to facilitate recruiting.
. Many Units Called Back
The national guard regiments or
dered ont today "for police purposes
-of protection," are the First West Vir
ginia; the Seventy Fourth New York
Infantry: the Second Connecticut In
fantry and the Second New Jersey In
fantry. Because of a misunderstand
ing as to the number or troops affect
ed by the order issued yesterday, stop
ping demobilization of the guardsmen
returning from border duty, the war
department also declared that all or
ganizations which have been muster
ed out of the federal service but have
not left the state camps for home be
brought back under arms. The First
Mississippi Infantry and ambulance
company No. 1. Alabama, are affected
by this provision.
A supplemental order Is expected to
recall the First Kentucky Infantry, a
part of which wa9 mustered out some
weeks ago. The regiment itself has
been retained in the federal service
and to complete its organization the,
missing unit9 may be brought back.
It is. not improbable that similar
supplemental orders may be Issued to
other organizations partly demobiliz
ed. The war department orders are
based on late officials' reports regard
ing the progress of demobilization
but of which some officials here have
not been advised to date.
Want More 'Sub' Chasers
At the navy department bids were
opened during the day for a large
quantity of ordnance supplies and
Secretary Daniels announced that ad
ditional bids would be opened Satur
day for submarine chasers. He ex
pects to order a large number of
these small craft as soon as all ship
building concerns have given the de
partment Information as to their
building capacities.
Offer Bonus to Builders?
The New York Shipbuilding Com
pany, the secretary also said, has
been requested to speed up construc
tion of the super-dreadnaught Idaho,
which was to be ready for launching
by October, but a postponement has
been necessary. Builders of the bat
tleships Maryland. Colorado. Wyom
ing and Washington also have been
requested to expedite construction
work, and to induce more rapid work,
a special bonus has been suggested
by the department.
Both the war and navy departments
are enrolling physicians from civil
life in order to expedite recruiting.
During the day Secretaries Lansing
Baker and Daniels conferred regard
ing the army and nary preparations.
Tonight Mr. Daniels left for Annapol
is to preside at the graduating exer
cises there tomorrow of the first class
of 1S4 midshipmen ordered into act

(By Review Leased Wire.)
BINGHAM. Utah, March 28
With gas fires raging slightly
above the 1500 level while huge suc
tion pumps are being worked to
the limit in an effort to flood the
workings, the great Utah-Apex
mines, one of the foremost copper
producers in the world, lies to
night inoperative, its 500 laborers
having been distributed among the
other mining properties of the
vicinity.
At the same time that the mine
is being flooded, preparations are
being rushed for the unwatering
of the workings when the fire shall
have been put out. .
According to V. S. Rood, mine
superintendent, the fire started by
decomposing sulphide ores, which
ignited the tunnel timbers. The
workings will be closed down not
less than three months, according
to Mr. Rood, and possibly longer.
RUSSIAN WORKMEN
REFUSE TO STRIKE
AT BOSSES' CALL
Usual Order Is Reversed, and
Bosses Are Ousted For Dis
loyalty in Effort To Curtail
Munitions.
(By Review Leased Wire)
PETROGRAD. Mar. 28. (10:30 p.
m. via London 11:45 p. m) The fac
tory workmen have reversed the us
ual order and prevented a strike
threatened by the "bosses," who had
been deposed or had had their author
ity curtailed This is the result of the
new liberty and equality. In a cer
tain munitions factory the disgrun
tled administration, seeing their old
berths slipping their grasp, decided tolwhich 8huid be precursors of great
send the factory on strike, but the
workmen, inspired by the appeals of
the new government for their support,
refused to walk out. On the contrary
they insisted that the foremen direct
ing the engineers should begin work
with them at daybreak and put in an
equal number of hours-.
"Every hour is precious," declared
the spokesman of the workers. "We
must work to support bur comrades
at the front. Every man who goes on
strike will be treated as a traitor."
A patriotic spirit appears to have
gripped the workmen. One group has j
given assurance, that the eight hour !
,,iv..!i !;,.m i
will not operate to diminish the out
put since, if it is necessary, the men
will work sixteen hours daily.
At a meeting of engineers, howev
er, a more pessimistic view was ex
pressed. Many complaints were lodg
ed that the workmen has changed
rolls and insisted upon distating the
terms as to hours and conditions.
One of the chief sources of protest is
the insistence of the workmen that
they oust uncongenial administrators
and replace them with men of their
own ehooBing, often from their own j
ranks. The appointment of an arbi
tration board, formerly demanded by
the workmen, now is desired by the
bosses, but declined by the workmen.

CHIHUAHUA CITY, March 28.
After a few skirmishes between van
guards below Chihuahua City, Villa j
has withdrawn his forces in a con-!
centratins movement toward
niiles bv WRf;on roa1 R0Ut
Satevo,
city, according to a statement Today
by General Francisco Murguia, who is
directing the campaign against the
v t t . . '
rebels in this state.
Bandits Starving.
Prisoners taken by the Carranza
forces were in a starving condi
tion and had to be fed before
they were able to answer the
questions put to them by officers.
They reported a general shortage
of provisions and ciDthing in
Villa's ranks.
General Murguia announced that he
would take the .offensive as soon as
the enemy's movement and possible
objectives were ascertained. '
Loyal Mexicans on the ranches are
assisting scouts to this end. he said.
Meantime the outposts stationed
around Chihuahua City maintain a
ci'ose watch against surprise. Plans
are drawn against any attempt to car
ry the city by storm.
Murguia Reinforced.
It is officially announced that rein
forcements have left Torreon by rail
to be incorporated in General Mur
guia's corps. This column numbers
over 4,000 men and Is under command
of General Martinez.
Army men here express the belief
that Villa's next move will be against
Santa Ysabel, a point 'on the Mexico
Northwestern Railroad about thirty
miles southwest of Chihuahua and
about forty miles northwest from
Satevo.
JUAREZ. March 28. Passengers ar
riving here by train late today report
ed that the fear of an attack by Villa
was passing away in Chihuahua City,
following the news that the rebels
were In retreat. Details regarding the
fighting, however, were not available.
Security Reigns Again.
That the tension has been consider
able Is indicated in today's issue of
EI Heraldo del Norte, of Chihuahua,
which endeavors to curb popular
alarm in an article beginning with:
"We consider altogether just the
i eagerness for news which we nave
noted on the part of the people of
Chihuahua in this solemn moment

The story, speaks of the great alarm
among the "timid" but declres that
persons experienced in such matters
give no Importance to the approach of
Villa. Alarming reports of battles
were in circulation yesterday, it con
tinues, but adds that these were mere
exchanges of fire between advanced
guards, which drove the rebels back
to their main command. I'p to last
night, no aetftn worthy of the name
of battle was said to have been re

SUMMARY,
Further gains by the British over
the Germans northwest of St. Quentin
and by the Germans over the French
in the Champagne. region are record
ed in the British and French official
communications.
British cavalry have captured the
villages of Villieres-Faucon and Saul
court, lying a few niifes north of Roi
se! and virtually astride the St. Quen-tin-Cambrai
road, says London, which
adds that additional terrain has been
taken from the German south and
west of Croisilles, despite strong re- .
sistance. T.eriin, however, takes is
sue with the latter statement, assert
ing that the fighting ntar Croisille"
favored the Germans.
South of St. Quentin, between Ks
signy and Denay, a fierce artillery du
el is in progress. No infantry action
has been fought.
In Champagne the Germans, after
a violent bombardment attacked Gen
eral Nivelle's troops west of Maisons
tie Champagne and penetrated ele
ments of the French first line trench
es. Sanguinary losses were inflicted
on the Germans, however, during un
successful efforts to capture the vil-1
age of Maisons de Champagne, says
Paris.

branch libraries, book loans, etc., have been organized
for interesting people and making the library more
useful.
Perhaps too much emphasis has been placed on the
circulation of books. The fact that the librarian, as well
as the books in his charge, can furnish information which
has been overlooked. People are apt to think of the
library as shelves and shelves of books, a bewildering
amount of reading matter. It seems much easier to
writs to a paper or magazine for desired information than
to go to the library and seek it for oneself.
That shouldn't be so. Let the libraries advertise not
books alone, but the information in these books, the card
index and reference works that make that information
available and the well-informed, courteous librarian ready
to help get at it Then, it is more than likely, the public
will get the library habit
EUROPE FREE.
The big war has begun to bear fruit. When it began,
observers in free countries immediately began to pro
phesy that the inevitable outcome would be the triumph
of democracy. It was felt, especially by Americans, that
absolutism and tyranny would crack under the strain.
It was thought that victory would come to the group of
belligerents which represented, on the whole, the highest
degree of political liberty. But whatever the superficial
outcome might be, it was declared that autocracy could
not survive the war in Russia, Germany or Austria, and
that every nation involved would w.in, through sacrifice,
a higher measure of freedom.
We have seen, in these three years, the tide of dem
ocracy slowly rising as these phophesies had fcretoH.
In nation after nation the people have grasped the reins
of power more fully. The movement was felt first in the
democratic countries England, France, Italy and th
European neutrals. But in the backward nations it lag
ged. Many began to fear that central and eastern Eur
ope might still throttle freedom. And Germany's amaz
ing efficiency for a time gave a false gleamor to absolut
ism. Russia ali at once has dispelled delusions and fears
by a wonderfully successful and easy revolution.
It still seems incredible, . because of its suddenness.
And yet, now that it has happened, earlier expectations
are recalled, and the change is seen to have been natural
and inevitable. Russia has all along been essentially
democratic. The autocratic rule of the czar was super
. imposed on a great nation of individualists, who, living
mostly in their rural villages, hjve a genius for liberty
and co-operaton. The war awoke them. ' Army life made
them feel their power, at the same time that it revealed
to them the incompetence of their governing class. The
country was ripe for the revolution, and It came spon
taneously. That revolution is a tremendous historical fact It has
' a vital, immediate bearing on the war; it seems to insure
more vigorous and effective fighting on Russia's part the
. elimination of Teutonic influence from Russia and a
' corresponding disheartenment of the Central Powers,
; and it enables the Allies to say now with truth that they
are fighting the battle of democracy.
The medieval autocracies of central Europe are there
fore under a hotter fire than ever. The German govern
ment has been quick to recognize the fact No sooner
had the Russian revolution succeeded than the German
chancellor, in a speech to the Prussian diet served
warning that Junkcrdom must yield it special privileges,
and promise a equitable suffrage and other political re
forms for Prussia.
Germany is less susceptible to revolution than Rusbia.
The German people are not free in spirit, as the Rus
sians are. They have been trained too long in political
submission. Their individualism has too long been sub
merged in the state. But even in Germany, and likewise in
Austria, there will be revolt unless the barriers of free
dom are removed.
Thus, considered broadly, the war has begun to justify
.itself. Perhaps all its barriers and sacrifices are not too
great a price to pay if, when the last gun has been fired
and the last man has died In a blood-soaked trench, there
shall arise a Europe truly free, typifying the ideals that
America lias realized from the beginuiug.
GETTING THE LIBRARY HABIT.
The Saturday Evening Tost voices a plea for more
library publicity. Libraries are full of information, their
staffs arc courteous and attentive, eager to help people
to find just the right book or bit of information tbey are
seeking. But, althought the library is working efficiently
and well for the people who seek its help, its existence j
seems to be unknown to many people who ought to be
using it.
M:n and women write to their daily newspaper or to j
ALL ONE CITY.
"A village," says John H. Finley, New York state com
missioner of education, "is simply a quiet street in the
big city of the world."
He refuses to see any Important distinction between
New York City and the rest of the state. The metropolis
is simply the "inner city," and the outlying part of the
state the "outer city." A resident of any remote part of
the commonwealth, when he goes to the metropolis,
doesn't really go "to town." He goes "down town."
Isn't it true? And isn't it the same with the metropolis
and the remainder of every state, and the same with
the country as a whole?
The old distinctions between city and country have
broken down. There is just one big community, differ
ing in the amount of space people occupy and the amount
of those around them, but not differing a great deal in
other respects a community held together by railroads
and mails, by newspapers and telegraphs and telephones,
by automobiles and phonographs and movies. One may
live a solitary life in the city and a cosmopolitan life in
the country. One may be cultured in a village and pro
.incial in the metropolis. Location doesn't matter much
any more. We are all fellow-townsmen.

A CHEERFUL TRAVELER. j
Most of us, if we had only one arm and no legs, would
regard traveling as out of the question. Most of us, too,
.uld consider curselves incapable of workiag, or under
no obligation to work. We'd probably stretch out a few
miserable and dependent years, and then shuffle off our
tiurden of life.
Not so with Alfred Le Roy of Los Angeles. Deprived
of both legs and the business end of his left arm, he asks
neither charity nor sympathy, but goes his own way, hoes
his own row, and does it with cheerfulness that oughj
to shame anybody with a full complement of limbs.
Le Roy is a familiar figure to hundreds of thousands
. f Americans. He Is seldom seen more than once, but
Jiat once is enough to leave a lasting memory of him.
He wanted to see America and he has seen it. . He has
solved the problem of locomotion to his complete satis
faction. He gets around on a motorcycle, and he covers
oj much ground with it that he has already crossed the
continent four times, and visited nearly all the states of
the Union.
It may seem impossible that anybody handicapped as
ue Roy is should be able to run a motorcycle and travel
alone, but he does it He has rigged up a cycle with a (
sidecar attachment and rearranged the controls so that
.ill but the steering can be done with his right hand, and
he steers wiOi the stump of his left arm. He scoots '
from town to town, making his living as he goes by sell- ,
ing postcards and chewing gum. And he certainly en
joys his travels. I

Member of Board, After Five
Years of Conscientious Ser

Elected Mis Successor.
' After five years of faithful and
conscientious service, Charles E. Mc
Donald announced yesterday that he
would not be a candidate for re-election
as a member of the school board
in the election Saturday. Mr. McDon
ald stated that he had decided not to
run again as he felt he could not give
the proper amount "of time to the posi
tion in the future.
Although several persons have been
mentioned as possible successors to
Mr. McDonald, it is probable that the
Rev. John E. Fry, pastor of the Presby
terian church, will be the only candi
date. Mr. McDonald said yesterday
that he knew of no other man tV well
qualified to serve on the school board
as Rev. Fry, and declared that he was

ALL CHILDREN LOVE
"SYRUP OF FIGS" FOR
LIVER AND BOWELS
Give it when feverish, cross,
bilious, for bad breath or
sour stomach.
! The "Hobo King," who has been de
livering talks during the last few
' weeks before boy scouts and- school
organizations in Arizona, will speak
in Volunteers' Hall on O. K. street,
tonight, telling of the perils of the
road and giving reasons why boys
i should not leave home. The "King"
j recently addressed the boy scouts of
I Tucson at the First Baptist church in
that city, and also spoke before the
fraternities of the state university
and the Tempe Normal school. Cap
tain and Mrs. Holman of the Volun
teers of America, have extended an
invitation to the public to attend the
lecture tonight, promising that it will
be of unusual interest.
Look at the tongue, Mother: If coat
ed, it is a sure sign that your little
one's stomach, liver and bowels need
a gentle, thorough cleansing at once.
When peevish, cross, listless, pale,
doesn't sleep, doesn't eat or act natu
rally, or is feverish, stomach sour,
breath bad, has stomach-ache, sore
throat, diarrhoea, full of cold, give a
teaspoonful of "Californio Syrup of
Figs," and in a few hours all the foul,
constipated waste, undigested food
and sour brte gently moves out of its
little bowels without griping, and you
have a well, playful child again.
You needn't coax sick children to
take this harmless "fruit laxative;"
they love its delicious taste, and it aJ
ways makes them feel splendid.
Ask your druggist for a 50-cent bot
tie of "California Syrup of Figs."
which has directions for babies, chil
dren of all ages and grown-ups plainly
on the bottle. Beware of counterfeits
sold here. To be sure you get the
genuine, ask to see that it is made by
"California Fig Syrup Company." Re

An Economic Problem
While the cost of nearly erery necessity of life has been steadily increasing,
the rates for telephone service have remained practically the same.
The bnyer of foodstuffs, although paying much more, receives but sixteen
ounces to the pound. On the other hand, the telephone user is constantly
receiving more and better service and paying the same or even a less rate
than he did a few years ago.
Gradually the value of telephone service has been increased by a constant
increase in the number of telephones added to the system and by improve
ments and refinements in the telephone art.
Steadily, too, the cost of every piece of equipment and of all supplies, copper
wire, iron wire, poles, hardware, etc., used in the business of furnishing serv
ice, has increased enormously.
In other words, our revenues have not increased hi proportion to increased
value of the service or hi proportion to increased cost of furnishing the service.
This presents a serious problem in which the public and the Company rre
mutuslly interested.
