'Leading Socialists and Labor
Men Gather In Minnesota
City to Create Organiza
tion to Foster Loyalty.
(By Review Leased Wire.)
MINNEAPOLIS, Minn.. "Sept. 4.
Labor representatives from all parts
of the country and former leading
members of the socialist party had set
the stage tonight for the big loyalty
conference under the auspices of the
American Alliance for -Labor and De
mocracy, an organization born two
weeks ago for the purpose of stamping
out disloyalty and sttlidifyipg labor be
hind the government.
Delegates March.
Amid the blare of bands, the 200 ac
credited delegates swung up Nicollett
avenue behind the Stars and stripes,
covering the course which the Feople's
Council of America for Democracy and
Terms of Peace, barred from the state
as disloyal, had planned to parade in
a demonstration today against war.
Address Soldier.
Preliminary conferences relative to
the establishment of local branches of
the organization throughout the south
held the attention of delegates dur
ing the day and tonight several mem
bers, including John Spargo, former
member of the executive committee of
the socialist party, spoke before sol
diers' relief organizations. The first
formal session will be held tomorrow.
Gompers on Hand.
Samuel Gompers, president of the
American Federation of Labor, and the
chairman of the alliance, arrived to
day. Mr. Gompers probably will be
elected permanent chairman and deliv
er his keyn'ote speech tomorrow, it
was said.
.Many Socialists Present.
In explaining the presence of the
large number of former members of
the socialist party. Including 12 for
mer editors of well known socialist
publications, Mr. Spargo declared that j
"all real socialists have been unable
to agree with the party's stand."
"We are still loyal to socialist prin
ciples," he said.
New Socialist Party.
"If there are any ex-socialists, they
are the ones who are the members of
the party now. There is being formed
an organization of socialists who have
left the party and it will almost im
mediately be a tremendously strong
power, so that the American people no
linger will look to the socialist party
for the interpretation of socialism.
"This conference will effect a perm
anent national organization. During
the war it will fight for industrial
democracy, and when the war is over,
we expect it will continue to fight"
Walsh at Meeting.
A great flame of patriotism, carry
ing with it an awakening of all Ameri
cans to a spirit of loyalty is sweeping
the country and before it subsides no
sensible man or wVnian will continue
to oppose the government's war policy,
according to Frank P. Walsh, chair
man f the United States commission
on industrial relations. Mr. Walsh will
be one cf the principal speakers at
the conference.
Disloyalty Discouraged.
"This movement to solidify all labor
forces behind the government and de
feat efforts of certain dangerous ele
ments to encourage d:s'Aalty is, in
my opinion, one of the greatest evr
undertaken," Mr. Walsh declared.
"And its success already has Seen as
sured." Loyalty Growing.
"The feeling of loyalty is growing so
rapidly that in ninety days there will
not be a word of disloyalty heard in
any part of the country."

! ADVOCATES OF
HIGH LEVIES
j Large Majority of- Senators
Vote Against Froposals to
Raise Levies In the War
Profits of Revenue Bill
(By Review Leased Wire).
WASHINGTON. Sept 4. In rapid
succession today. the senate bowled ov
er by overwhelming majorities three
more proposals from the group of sen
ators seeking to increase the levies oa
war profits in the tax bill.
Three Offers Rejected.
An amendment by Senator HoliU to
tax war profits only at higher rai;3
and to strike "out the finance comir.l
tee's new clause levying $428,im0,oo
additional on ordinary excess profit -i,
was rejected 57 to 12. Then wiihcut
deoate, one by a Wisconsin senator to
fix a flat rate of 60 per cent, designed
to raise not less than $1,800,000,000 on
war profits, was beaten 5 Oto 18. The
minimum flat rate proposal of 50 per
cent of the high tax group presented
by Senator Ho lis, was voted down,
52 to 18.
Flat Rate Loses.
. With these setbacks, the fight to
substitute a flat rate for the graduat
ed system of the excess war profits
section virtually ended and the con
test entered a new stage. Before the
final vote on the war profits section,
set for late tomorrow, the high lax fac
tion plans an effort to raise the grad
uated rates now in the bill. Today's
session was marked by spirited tilts
in the last stand of the high tax advo
cates to impose a flat, general rale on
war profits. The group still 'upes to
increase the tax levy by raising the
graduated rates, but finance cotnuiii

WASHINGTON, Sept. 4. Cap

and sunk Augtst 6, by a German
submarine ar in a prison camp

American Red Cross was advis
ed today by cst'.e from Geneva.
The message made no mention
of Seaman Vliliani Albert Miller,
the other prisoner, and an inquiry
has been cabled to Geneva to learn
his fate.
Four Seamen.
The four gunners held by the
Germans are James Delahey, chief
gunner's mat in charge of the
gun crew; Ray Roop, boatswain's
mate; Charles Lovan Kline, gun
ner's mate, and Fred Stephen
Jacobs, a seaman. They with Mil
iar were the first American naval
men to be taken prisoner since
war was declared on Germany.
It had been feared that they and
Captain Oliver had been lost.
Forced To Surrender.
The Campana was forced to sur
rnder becaus the naval guard ex
hausted its supply of 180 shells
in a fourfiours running fight with
the subilarine, which fired sev
eral hundred shots at a range of
more than 7000 wards. The
Germans continued the bombard

and the ships company look to the

Six Prisoners Taken.
The submarine quickly over

the men it could accommodate.
The reminder of the crew were
allowed to retv.-n to the Campana
for their personal effects and then
the tanker was sent to the bottom.
Rrift Nine Hours
After drifting nine hours in the
small boats, the eight naval gun
ners and 40 men of the Campana's
crew were rescuted by a French
war ship and landed in France.
The submarine captain reported
that he had been out a long time

CHICAGO, Sept 4. Chicago's city
council, sitting as a committee of the

hour special session I'oday adopted by
a vote of 42 to 6 a resolution praising
Governor Lowden for his action in ov
erriding Mayor William H. Thompson
by refusing permission to the People's
Council for Democracy and Peace
terms to meet in Illinois and urging
the state's chief executive to prevent

The resolution was presented by Al

by several amendments before filial
adoption.
The city council will meet October

CHICAGO ADOP

THE !!
ASSURED
Vote Will Be Taken In the
Lower House On Bond and
Certificate Measure Today.
Moore Amendment Left
Out
.By Review Leased wire)
WASHINGTON, Sept. 4. Passagu
of the m.53S.945.460 war bend and
certificate bill by the house in vlrtu
iilly the form it was received from
the committee seemed assured tonight
after four hours of general debate on
the measure. All parties are united
In supposing the general features of
the bill and a fight by Representative
Moore of Pennsylvania for his propos
ed amendment to create a war ex
penditures committee probably will
not delay the vote beyond late tomor
row. President Opposes Plan.
President Wilson let it be known
at the white house today that he was
stifl opposed to any congressional war
committee and administration leaders
immediately laid plans to strike out
the Moore proposal on a point of or
der. Mr. Moore then introduced it
as a separate bill, so if it is defeated
as tin amendment he still will have
another chance to bring it up.
Moore Defends Proposal.
Mr. Moore devoted much of a long
speech on the bond measure to his
amendment, declaring that congress
was in the dark on much of the ad
ministration's financial transactions.
By questioning he also drew from Rep
resentative Fordney of Michigan, rank
ing republican member of the ways
and means committee a statement
that he favored a war expenditures
committee.
Must Vote Bonds.
Both Democratic Leader Kitchln
and Representative Fordney present
ed the bond bill to the house, urging
that if the United States is to remain
in the war, "congress must vote the
bonds as the necessary money cannot
ba raised by taxation.
New Allied Loan.
The question of making a new $4,
000,000.000 loan to the allies is the
only real one before the bouse, Mr.
Kitchin insisted. Their cause and
the cause of the United States are
one, he added and the United Stales
is obliged to make the loan.
Kitchin Speaks.
Mr. Kitchin was before the house
for more than an hour replying much
of the time to a running fire of good
natured questions. No serious oppo
sition to the bill appeared, but he was
asked to explain its many intricate
points. One of his statements, in re
ply to a query, was that about 80 or
90 per cent of the money already
loaned the allies had been expended
in this country and that he thought
75 per cent of the newly proposed
loan also would be spent here.
Qualified Endorsement
After indorsing the bill generally
and declaring that he intended to sup
port it if it could not be amended,
Mr. Fordney went on record as oppos
ed to both the proposed tax on bonds
and the failure to put a limit on their
convertibility. Four per cent, Mr.
Fordney said, is as high a rate of in
terest as the government should be
compelled to pay, and more probably
will have to be paid on the bonds now
being authorized if they are made
convertible.
Clark Favors Taxation.
Speaker Clark Interrupted Mr. Ford
ney to say that he favored paying
more of the war debt by taxation than
the bill contemplates.
"I understand you to say." the
speaker said, "that we should carry
on this war principally by the yu
ance of bonds instead of levying tax
es. That ends this way: The men
who survive the fighting will come
back and help pay this very war debt."
"That Is true," replied Mr. Ford
ney. The speaker then added that he
i thought the debt might be divided
; "fifty-fifty" between bonds and taxes.
under such arrangement, he declared,
! he had no fear of depreciation of the
bonds.

From Out Of City.
The out-of-town boys stayed at the
Copper Queen hotel last night, aiid
there isn't much doubt about their
having slept soundly. They put in a
rather strenuous day yesterday. Sher
iff Wheeler took charge of all the
men who are leaving and put them
through their preliminary paces 'n
soldering. It took a dash of imagi
nation to picture those same men in
the trenches a few months hence, or
even to visualize them as smartly,
set-up soldiers, marching in smoothly
drilled companies in but a few weeks;
yet before another September comes
these men will be hardened veterans
many of them officers and each will
be patiently explaining simple move
ments to raw recruits just as yester
day those same movements were ex
plained to him.
The sheriff taught them the facings
and the squad movements, and the
men entered into the spirit of the
thing with enthusiasm and all good
will. Some of them were fat, others
were thin; some wore army shirts,
some wore silk shirts, some wore cot
ton shirts; a few wore caps, a few
wore straws, and many wore Stetsons.

Washington Wakeni.
Washington, long used to glittering

cheered itself hoarse at the spectacle.
For two hours, while in tother cities
throughout the nation over thousands
moved over the first part of the long
road that may lead to French battle
fields, Pennsylvania avenue beard tha
tramp of marching men, the jingle oC
spurs and the rumble of artillery.
Many In Parade.
About 26,000 men, women and child
ren passed a reviewing stand befrra
the White House where the president
and his guests watched the pa-ade.
More than half of the long line w?s in
uniform. There were regulars from
infantry, cavalry and artil.cry regl

from the officers' train. a, camp at Ft.

Stars and Stripes Wave.
The Stars and Stripes waved from

head of every unit and in the hands 'ol
most of the civilian marchers.
From the corner of Fifteenth sl.-eot
where Pennsylvania avenue turns
around the treasury, the long urle to

the stand with him were kep; tt sa

President Leads March.
President Wilson himself, e;." t
the front stepping out like a f.elily
trained recruitfi marched at the head
of the long line surrounded b a com

as they probably never have given on,
any occasion in the Pong years since
this country became a nation.

When he reached the White House
the president left the ranks a-d tcok

members leaped to their feet, swung
their hats and cheered.

Wednesday Morning, September 5, 1917.
Two thousand years ago a Greek sculptor was
making a great statue of Jupiter. He was asked why
he chiseled so carefully the back of the figure, as it
would be against a wall where the back would not be
seen. He replied, "I work not for the eyes of men
but for the gods."
Suppose that Germany had, at the beginning of the
war, not Invaded Belgium at all and had waited for
France at the Rhine and hurled the full force of her mili
tary power at Russia. Suppose that those green and gray
hosts that swept up to the very gates of Paris had been
loosed against' the Russian bear. Russia would have
been out of the war in three months. Rumania would
never have entered the lists. The Balkins would have
been swept as clean as a Dutch housewife's kitchen.
Then the Germans would have turned on France.
England, even though she had by this time have entered
the war, which would have been doubtful, would have
been torn by dissention and her movements would have
lacked directness and energy. For England, be it known,
swept forward to the conflict united and savage, simply
because Belgium had been invaded in direct violation of
the solemn treaty and agreement of protection for that
little nation.
Germany might well have won the war if she had
kept out of Belgium and dealt with France and Russia
separately. And more than this, her standing before the
world would have had some semblance of honor and hu
manity. But the Prussian is a cynic. He spent millions for
thirty years filling all the countries of the world with
spies and their reports were his undoing. Every report
was based upon the assumption that the Prussian was a
superman and that the other nations were mere weak
lings. No one but a Prussian would have underestimated
France and England. For over a thousand years two
nations have been the greatest fighters in the world.
Always they have fought to a finish. Warlike to the
core. Intensely proud. Generally successful. England
has never lost a war since William the Conqueror beat
Harold at Hastings, unless we except the rebellion of
the American colonies. France has fought all of Europe
time and time again and won more battles than any na
tion since Rameses was king of Egypt. Napoleon used to
stable his horses in Bediin once a year for fifteen years.
After their first successes in Belgium and at Mons
and Charleroi, before the allies were ready, the Prus
sians have never been able to make headway against
the French and English. For two years they have been
pressed to the uttermost to hold their own. The English
and French have outfought the picked troops of the kai
ser in every battle and tkirmish since the Marne.
The glory of France and the pluck of England form
a terrible combination, and they have always been ter
rible. History is merely repeating Itself. Blood will
telL Only a Prussian could have made such a mistake.
But in the east Germany still wins. She has always
won there. She can beat the Russians and the Routna
nians and the Serbs. Hor only victories since Charleroi.
when she employed artillery and machine guns against
rifles, have been in the east. If she can hold her own in
the west now she calls it a great victory.
And soon she will have another enemy on the west
ern front as brave and as warlike and as well equipped
as either France or England. In fact, America is one of
the same stripe and breed and blood as these two fa
mous fighters. The war will be won between Franca
and the Rhine
If Germany had it. to do ovi r agr.in. knowing as she
does the strength of England and France, and the weak
ness of Russia, and the martyrdom of Belgium and the
unselfish courage of the United States, would she act the
same? The Prussian cynic has had-a shattering blow.
Verdun, the Soninie. Flanders, each one of these fell upon
his thick head like an eight inch gas pipe in the hands
of a giant. He can turn only towards the fleeing and
cowardly Russians, and to little Roumania and Serbia
for one grain of comfort to sustain his ego. Practically
all the first line troops that composed his magnificent
armies onw sleep the sleep that knows no waking along
the Aisne, the Somme, the Lys, the Oise and the canals
of Belgium. The Prussian Guards and the Pommera
nians and the Bavarians and the Brandenburgers that
were the pride of the kaiser's life are skeleton ragmet ts
the regiments tiiat ised to fill German hearts with
boisterous pride v hen t'iey paraded at Potsdam in their
irresistible glory.
They broke agarast the rock ;t the English lines
that has stood in war unbroken for ten centuries. They
were .cut down by the Gaul who has been a gallant and
successful warrior ever since Charles Mattel beat lie
Mohammedan hosts at Tours:
No, If it were to do over again, the kaiser would prob
ably still be reviewing his spic and span regiments at
Potsdam and telling them how easy it would be to crush
the English and French if they only had a chance. The
nightmares of Verdun and Arras would haunt not his
bedchamber this night. He might be lolling about the
czar's palace in Petrograd and working the Siberian
salt mines and showing the Russian anarchists a new
form of torture undreamed of by that bearded and wild
eyed horde, BUT, that plunge westward he never culd
make again.
BRITISH STILL EXPECT A BREAK
Here are two opinions, one from a British source
and one from a German. The bulldog British still exepct
to break the German line in Flanders this fall. The
German opinion shows just how important is regarded
the outcome .of the fighting in Flanders for Lille anl the
German submarine bases. The British opinion, voiced
by the Manchester, England, Guardian, is as follows:
"The French have given up the idea of breaking
through this year, but we have not given up the idea
of breaking through in Flanders, which, as things have
developed, is quite as necessary to the defense of this
country during winter as the expulsion of the enemy
from French soil is to the French. Perhaps the weather
in the east of France has been drier than in the west and
perhaps the explanation of the slower progress made by
the British in Flanders is that the Germans attach much
more importance to Flanders than the environs of Ver
dun. However that may be, our progress ca nhardly be
said to have been equal to our ambitions or our expec
tations." Confirmation of this view is found in an article in
the Vossische Zeituug by Max Osborn, the ibrrespondent
in Flanders, who writes:
"Nobody here conceals the colossal gravity of this
endless struggle. On its outcome depends whether En
gland is able to wrest from our hands the strongest wea
pon we possess to frustrate her calculations. Decisions
of life and death are being made here, of our life and of
our death. Never has the defensive character of the
whole war been so graphically revealed. If we are de
feated here we shall be face to face with the certainty
that all will be over with the glory of the empire and
the splendor of the German name."
WHAT ABOUT THE PACIFISTS?
(New York World)
v What effect will the President's reply to the Vatican
have upon our pacifist friends? Will they be spurred to
new efforts by this evidence of a shameful conspiracy
to upset the Hohenzollern dynasty and to unhorse the
benevolent autocracy that rules Germany in the name
of Junkertum?
After playing the kaiser's game with so much zest
and enthusiasm, it must come as a shock to them to find
that the President is not concerned with hair-splitting
terms of peace, and bases his demands squarely upon
the establishment of a responsible government in Ger
many which will be the servant of the German people
and which the rest of the world can trust. Will thene
be enough soap boxes to hold all the impassioned pacifist
orators who will now rush to the defense of Prussianism
and denounce the infamy of a war policy that is direct e l
against the very existence of that lovely Institution?

"High wages, scarce materials and the draft hit in
dustry," that is the way a headline describes conditions
in the automobile manufacturing centers of Michigan.
And on the top of these hard conditions conies t.'ie call
to speed up production. All of which moans only one
thing to the industrial centers of the union, of which
Bisbee claims, in a modest way, to he one, and that is to
buckle in and see it through. Faith, courage and energy
are the attributes that every city must have to win.
Billy Sunday has struck Los Angeles like a simoon.
Billy not only gets the first page on all papers, but he
gets the second, fifth and seventh pages as well. Funnv
thing about this man Sunday, he seems to have me
tered the art of abusing people with such artistry and
fervour that t.'iey actually like it and give him much
money and newspaper space for doing so. His antics,
his vulgarities and his loud and profane shoutings are
in strange contrast with the methods of the old prophets
and the disciples and the Carpenter's Lowly Son about
whom he speaks occasionally in his sermons.

CUTTING THE MELON
The world wi.l be a better place
when kaiscrism meets its doom, for
then the well known human race wid

the kaiser's been a threat, e'en when
he talked of peace the mcst: he made
tiie whole world go in debt for ships
and guns and armored host. If seme
one lives next door to me, of whom
t live in constant fear. I may be nom

cuse, a;l full of fight, to knock uj
plexus out of plumb, and so I cannot
sleep at night. It's vain I'j tell me 1
am free, that laws protect me, and
police; while that man lives next door
to me, all empty is your boon of peace.
Thus to the world has Kaiser Bill a
menace been, a nightmare threat;
while talking peace he yearned to kill,
and soak the globe in carnage wet. Be
cause of him the nations bore a :oad
that sapped their strength away, an.l
manufactured to'jls of gore, instead
of tools for baling hay. When kaiser

with sik'ning thud, the world will have
a long sweet rest from all this tail:
of war and blood.

T
CONDITION EXISTED
AT STATE PRISON
An interesting and almost senation
il report on the state prison has been
submitted to Governor Campbell by C.
P. Lee, auditor and public accountant,
whose preface to the report indicates
he d fficulties he encountered in for
mulating a report. Mr. Lee says:
"The records are very incomplete,
particularly with respect to sales of
supplies and cash transactions. Noth
ng could be found touching on the
rriginal supplies to guard3, 'officers
:nd others not inmates of the institu
tion. No attempt has ever been inaiic
to keep a check 'on supplies from the
store room. It would be an endless
job to attempt to prove out the sup
plies for the past two or five years or
any period in the past five years in
.' Inch such a procedure might be at
.empied. "No- inventory has ever been taken,
,'j the stock on hand would have to be
guessed at as a starting point. To it
would have to be added ail purchases
of supplies from original claim. as per
Invoices. From this amount wouirt be
deducted all requisitins for inmates'
mess covering the period, and also the
amounts sold to guards' mess and 'olfi
:ers and eaipolyes of the institution,
plus the inventory at the end of the
period Now, if there was found to be
a balance of supply purchases unac
counted for during such period by the
above process the queston would rije,
To whom Is the difference chargeable
or who is responsible for the discrep
ancy? I am therefore not attempting
to show any discrepancy except in a
comparative way. particularly c ?rin;
the period between September, 1915,
and June 15, 1917, when the rrethods
used seem to have been mor? lax than
at any 'other time during the pr..-t five
years."
Mr. Lee made several attempts to
secure assistance from former offi
cials of the prison, in the hope that
some light might be thrown upon mis
ty transactions but was unable to do
so.
The accountant was somewhat
aware of the difficulties that lay in
his way, for he had s'ome previous ex
perience with the accounts of the pris
on. He made an audit in the summer
of 1910 for the state auditor. The
books and records were in very bad
shape at that time and as a result of
Mr. Lee's findings the then secretary
of the prison was asked to resign and
a successor was appointed.
The reports contains such state
ments of balances and analyses l ac
counts as could be made up from the
available figures, but to the average
reader they would mean litt'.e. Oth
er tacts are set forth by Mr. Lee in
notes accompanying the report. There
are many instances of Irregularities
and some, doubtless is of speculation.
It is related that Pete Avenente, one
of the guards, on October 7. 1916, paid
his acc'.nint. eidently for supplies fur
nished him, amounting to $65.40. As
li-.is been stated, no iccord of charge
accounts could be discovered so Mr.
Lee could not state definitely whether
this account was correct. Howtvcr.
the foreging amount was afterward
changed on the books to $"5.40 making

Arizona had the solitary distinction
of being represented by a woman in
the National Convention of Insurance
Commissioners at Minneapolis. Arizo-;
na's delegate was Mrs. Banta. chief
clerk of the insurance department of
the commission. When the roll of
delegates was called. Arizona not be
ing represented, Mrs. Banta was the
first to respond to the call of states
and was enthusiastically cheered..
There was no other woman in the con

Campbell.
Gross irregularities, though Mr. Lee
does not directly charge that there
was anything worse in the distribu
tion of supp'ies to the guard mess and
elsewhere. No record of supply sales
to guards and 'others have been uis o
cred covering the part of two ers
prior to June 15, 1917. Mr. Lee makes
the following comment: "It has been
whispered around that supply charges
were made on slips, placed on spindles
on desks around the office and thai
collections were made for those that
'did n'ot blow away. A comparison of,
! the monthly averages would indicate
considerable windy weather, at least
! in spots."
The monthly averages to which Mr.
Lee refers were of sales to guards ami
those who were regularly employed at
the prison. These averages were based
on the known time that these persons
were employed during the period cov
ered by the figures compiled.
The account of Brink ley, the con

It was made up by Mr. Ijev from'

Brinkley had charged himself with
amounts aggregating $r.rrt. The fi ed
it lie gave to himself amounted to
$:!6. 15. leaving an overdraft of $ lit. 11.
This comment of Uriukley's account is
made by Mr. Lee:
'o far lack of proper records the
above record, no doubt, shows only a
small part fo bis speculations in the
period from October. 1916, to May 1.
1917, while he was in the superintend
ent's oflice."

Italians Still Active.
In the Austro-Italian theater inten
sive infantry fighting has given way
for the moment to artillery duels ot
great violence. The cessation in the '
fighting is probably due to a realign-'

It is reported that the Austro-Hun-garians

The process of heating water for domestic purposes has been revolutionized in the past
few years through the introduction and perfection of gas fired water heaters, until today
it is no longer a problem to secure an abundance of hot water quickly and economically
in any dwelling, large or small.
Today, in the countless thousands of homes where gas fired water heaters are in
stalled, an abundance of hot water is available for any purpose. By some types of heat
ers the water is heated instantly at the turn of a faucet, by others, within a few min
utes after lighting the heaters, and all without labor, inconvenience or discomfort, and
at a reasonable cost for gas.

GRAIN MARKETS.
, CHICAGO, Sept. 4. Grain prices
.suffered something of a setback ioda
owing to weakness in the New York
stock market. Corn closed heavy
to Ei net lower with December at $1.11
to $1.11 and May at n.07 to
11.08. Wheat virtually disappeared
eb a Board of Trade commodity but
was held stable on the basis of 220
a bushel for the No. 1 northern grade,
the standard recently fixed by repre
sentatives of the federal government.
Provisions down 12 to 45 cents. Oats
finished to V, lower.
Notwithstanding the fact that fed
eral buying of wheat had been well ad
vertized a little business was done
at slightly above the government ba
sis but this was quickly stopped by
the food administrator, and later sales
were in complete accordance with the
official B'andards recently announced
from Washington.
Oats were ruled by sympathy with
the corn market. Some attention
tnougn was given 10 uraiuu in
timates and to an increase of the do
mestic visible supply total.
Lower value on hogs made the pro
vision market weak from the outstart.
Packers however, were fully active
buyers at the decline.
NEW YORK FINANCIAL.
NEW YORK, Sept. 4. The absolute
dominance of the short interest over
prevailing market conditions was dem
onstrated anew today when stocks un
derwent further serious depreciation.
Crumbling of quoted values was the
more disturbing from the fact that the
new movement not only proved a com
plete reversal of early tendencies, but
encompassed many high grade rail
road shares at extreme recessions of
2 to 5 points.
Initial advances were more than
maintained until noon, when New
York Central. St. Paul and New Ha
ven developed acute weakness, all de
clining to low records.
With the break in rails came a more
severe setback to the industrials. U.
S. Steel fell from its early high of
111. which represented a gain over
last week of 1 to 2 and closed at
104. a net loss of 4 points. Ship
pings, oils, motors and a few stocks
in which forenoon advances ran from
three to seven points, reacted no less
sharply than steels. Activity was
at its flood in the final hour, that
period also marking the day's lowest
prices.
On the surface there was no defi
nite news to explain the melting away
of quotations but various pessimistic
rumors helped to bring about the set
back. Total sales, 1,100,000 shares.
Bonds were heavy or weak with
signs of liquidation. Liberty 3's
ruled between 99.88 to 99.94. Total
bond sales, par value, aggregated $3,
680.000. U. S. bonds, (old issues), were un
changed on call.
NEW YORK. Sept. 4. New factors
were Injected in the situation today,
althouh there were many rumors In
circulation of an unfavorable aspect
and the action of the market was a
precursor of the unsettled sentiment
prevailing. The changed conditions
are reflected in a keener desire on the
part of investment holders to view the
situation generally in a less favorable
light and it is highly probable that the
status of affairs prevailing will lend
further impartment of quoted secur
ity values.

Victrola as a dance ''orchestra"
affords always the best and the
latest numbers, that its dance music
is unfailingly perfect in time, and
that its musicians are the best: but to the true dance-lover
the greatest privilege the Victrola brings is the joy of dar.ci.-g
whenever and wherever " the spirit moves."
Victors and Victorias $10 to $200. Easy terms.

signs of weak or disordered kidneys

Mrs. Lillie Crabb. of 117 Opera

kidney trouble should try Doan's Kid
ney rills. About a year aeo my back
was awful lame and I never bf nt over
but what sharp pains ould catch me
in my back and I would get dizzy. That
steady ache in my bak seemed to tire
me out and I felt drowsy all the time.
