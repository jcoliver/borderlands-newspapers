WASHINGTON", Dec. 7. Two spec
ial American Red Cross trains, carry
ing the personnel and equipment of an
entire, base hospital unit, with ad
ditional doctors, nurses and social I
workers, foodstuffs, bedding, nothing
and surgical supplies, were rushing
through New England tonight to the
stricken city of Halifax. Special
arrangements for their prompt move
ment had been made by the railroads
pver which they were to pass.
eBfore the arrival of the trains,
however, the active work of American
Red Cross relief was expected to be
well under way. as there were six
RDecial workers with surgical and hos
pital supplies aboard the Massacnu-'
setts special train due at Halifax to
night John F. Moors will take
charge of the work upon his arrival
tomorrow.
Washington to Direct Aid
President Wilson in a telegram to
the governor general of Canada today
offered "the heartfult sympathy and
grief of the people of the United
States to "their noble brethren or the
dominion." In congress Representa
tive Tagne of Massachusetts introduc
ed a joint resolution Va appropriate
$5,000,000 for the relief of the stricken
people.
In order that his work at Halifax
may not be hampered more than neces
sary, Mr. Moors will refer all offers or
aid to Frank ePrsons, director of
civilian relief of the Red Cross at
headquarters here. If aid is accepted,
it waa announced, it will be directed
from Washington. Many offers of
help came today. No appeal for as
sistance has been made, however, and
owing to the high state of prepared
ness of the Red Cross since the war
began it is not believed that any will
be neccessary.

Windows All Broken ;
At St John, where a great quantity I
of hospital supplies was taken aboard, I
Mr. Ratshesky learned that virtually
every pane of glass in Halifax had !
been shattered by the blast from tbej
harbor. It is easy to comprehend j
what that means with snow and sleet. :
A request was sent to Boston for '
prompt smpment oi glass, putty ana
tar sheets to make oofs for the
homeless.
Through most of the day the relief
train was racing in the teeth of a
blizzard. As the distance to Hali

creased and snow piled higher every

stood in the told waiting eagerly for
news from the stricken city.
Plans of the relief party for Imme

U. S. May Help
Italy On the
Asiago Plateau
(By Review Leased Wire.)
The United States is at war with
Austria-Hungary.
With unanimity except for a nega
tive vote cast In the house f repre
sentatives by a socialist member
both houses of congress Friday acted
favorably on the request made by
President Wilson In his recent ad
dress to congress that the United
States declare war on the dual mon
archy, which, the president asserted,
was "not her own mistress, but sim
ply the vassal of the German govern
ment." There was scarcely any de
bate on the ,avar resolution In either
house.
Shortly after the action of the two
houses of congress. President Wilson
affixed his signature to the measure,
which definitely aligned Austria-Hungary
as an enemy country.
U. S. May Aid Italy
The taking up of arms againbt
Austria-Hungary comes at most op
portune time, for it will permit of the
United States lending aid to sorely
stricken Italy, which the Austro
Germans are striving to render a
negligible factor in future operations.
Turkey and Bulgaria were excluded
from the operations of the war resolu
tion, but the temper of both houses
nf coneress indicates that whenever

lar action against these countries,
which he characterized as also the

desires will be forthcoming.
That the Italians are being hard
pressed by the enemy In greatly su
Perior numbers and in gun power is
lndlf a,ed b' ,,ate8,t ofn.cial fom'
munication. Additional gains have
been made by the invaders in the
Asiago plateau region, but again a
heavy price in men killed or wounded
was paid by the attacking forces. At
last accounts the Italian line sti'
intact and the way barred against the
enemy debouching on the Veneian
plain.
The Berlin war office announcement
asserts that 4000 additional men have
been made prisoner on the Italian
fmnt bringing the total since the
new offensive began up to 15.000.
Rumanians Will Not Fraternize
Only minor operations are In pro
gress on the other battle fronts.
The cessation of hostilities along
the eastern front has extended to that
part of the line held by the Ru
manians. An official communication
from .Tassy says that as a result of
the Russians having proposed an
armistice to the enemy, it had been
decided taht the Rumanians should
associate themselves with the Rus
sians, and that therefore fighting has
ceased. The Rumanians however,
have declined all attempts by the en
emy to fraternize with them.
manian communication today says:
"The Russian command having pro
Dosed an armistic to the enemy and to
the Rumanian troops forming part of
this front, it was decided that the Ru
manian troops should associate them
selves with this proposition. As a con
sequence, hostilities were suspended
on the whole of the front.
"The enemy troops loudly manifest
ed their satisfaction and endeavored
to approach the Runianian.net work
system. The Rumanian troops main
tained a reserved and dignified atti
tude and rejected every attempt at
fraternisation.
Mexican Soldiers
Defeat Band of
Villa's Troops
(Ity Review Leased Wire)
JUAREZ. Mex.. Dec. 7.-Combined
columns of federal cavalry in com
mand of General Francis'. Muguia
and General Pedro Favt-la ambushed
a large band of Villa followers in
Santa Clara canyon. '75 miles north
west "of Chihuahua city. Tuesday, ac
cording to an official staement given
out at military headquar.er hen- to
night. A total of 400 were killed and
wounded on both sides. The Villa
forces suffered the heaviest losses
from the enfilading fire of the fed
eral force.
An unconfirmed report was r?eived
here tonight that Hipolito Vilia,
bi'jther of Francisco Villa and a col
onel in his command, was killed dur
ing the fighting. A: military heud
quartersColonel Joaquin Gomez Tagle,
chief of staff, said no official reports
had been received from Chihuahua
city referring to the killing of Villa'd
brother.
The command was believed to have
been that headed by Lopez, which
attacked a train near El Mocho last
week and killed General Eudardo Cha
vez and practically all of his escort.
Villa was not believed to have been J
present in person and this caused the
report that Hipolito was killed to be
doubted in official circles here.
Started Last Saturday I
The battle started Saturday when1
General Favela engaged the Villa
force guarding the entrance to Santa
Clara canyon. Finding the force of
Villa troops much stronger than he an
ticipated, he withdrew and sent to
Chihuahua city ijr reinforcements.
General Murguia answered the call in
person and rushed his troops to the
scene of the fighting, arriving there,!
overland, Monday night with a strung
cavalry column.
The attack in force started at day
break Tuesday morning and the Villa
forces were forced to flee into the
canyon, where they were sought out J
and killed like rabbits, according to
accounts received here today. The
number of Villa prisoners and wound
ed and captured was given as 150,!
while an equal number were killed in
battle. The federal losses were
lighter because of the fact that they
swept the Villa ranks with machine
guns and rifle fire and did not give
the Villa troops an opportunity to
charge. Many horse, much amruuui-j
tion and other military equipment
were captured and the villa forces
driven in the direction of Namiquipa,
which Is on the Pershing trail.
Villa's Men Decisively Defeated
"Ideal," a local newspaper, published
an extra tonight giving the details of
the Santa Clara canyon battle, stating
that Villa's forces had suffered a de
cisive defeat at the hands of General
Murguia. All information about the
battle was withheld until late tonight
for military reasons.
Santa Clara canyon is a perfect set
ting for such a battle. It is a break
in the mountains west of Laguna sta
tion and is more than three miles long.
The walls are steep and there are but
two entrances to the box-like forma
tion. The floor of the canyon is cov
ered with grass, watered from springs,
and the canyon has long been a fa
vorite rendezvous 'of Villa, because of
the pasturage for his mounts there:
Expect Attack at Ojinaga
FABENS, Tex., Dec. 7. Another at
tack is expected to occur on Ojinaga,
opposite Presidio, Tex., soon; if the
Villa forces under General Porfirio
Ornelas do not evacuate the border
port and rejoin Villa in the field. A
column of federal troops estimated to
include 300 cavalraymen headed by
General Jose Carlos Murguia and his
famous "Death Head Troop,'" passed
through today, following the river l'Jad
to Ojinaga to recapture the town for
the federal government As General
Ornelashas fewer than 200 men there,
he is expected to abandon the p'ort,
which was captured by Villa Novem
ber 14. Firing occurred opposite here
last night but was believed to have
been federal patrols firing on Villa am

FUTURE OF 1 1
CONTROL RESTS
WITH PRESIDENT
(By Review Leased Wire.)
WASHINGTON. Dec. 7. A decision
as to the government's atthude to
ward the railroads, involving sugges
tions for either government opera
tion during the war or suspension of
anti-trust laws and financial support
still res'ed tonight with President
Wilson. No move was looked for until
after .Monday, when the president will
go over the entire subject with Sena
tor Nevlands, chairman of the con
gressional Investigating transporta
tion problems.
Today, however, brought three im
portant developments In the situation;
They were:
An order by .Robert S. Lovett, di
rector of priority, giving preferential
shipment to fuel, food and govern
ment supplies over all general freight.
Indications that- the government
will name a general traffic manager
to take entire charge of the move
ment of government supplies and war
materials.
New Mnaagerrent Unnecessary
A statement from Fairfax Harrison,
chairman of the railway war board,
that the roads-under present direction
are prepared to furnish all the trans
portation possible to obtain under any
management.
The president is viewing the prob
lem from every angle. 'His advisers
are by no means of one mind on the
subject, and their proposals have run
all the way from a policy of govern
ment seizure to that of a hands-orr
attitude, leaving the roads to work
the problem out themselves. He gave
careful study to the interstate com
merce commission's recommendation
to congress that the government op
erate the roads or suspend during the
wr.r laws which prevent a complete
pooling and a consequent unification
of all rail systems.
Priority Order Issued
Today's priority order, effective De
cember 12. Is the first general order
issued by the government classifying
materials for shipment. It was issued
at the urgent request of the food and
fuel administrations and governmant
departments. The railroads have op
posed It on the ground that it would
retard rather than expedite ship
ments. The materials classified today wiil
move in the following order:
Railroad fuel; livestock, perishablj
foods and feeds; military supplier,
other government supplies on special
request; coal for coking plants and
coal for current use. The movement
or coal Is prescribed In a manner
similar to a request for preferential
shipment for specified requirements
requested of producers several days
ago by Fuel Administrator Garfield.
Certain Classes Not Affected
The new order does not affect pri
ority order No. 2. relative to open
top cars; No. .1, relative to movement
of coal from mines in Utah and Wy
oming, and No. 4, relative to ship
ments of cattle feed to Texas and
New Mexico.
The intimation that the government
will name a traffic manager came
from the railroad war board. whl"n
has urged the appointment of such a
man to co-ordinate demands by vari
ous government departments for pri
ority for their shipments. Ed war 1
Chambers of the Santa Fe system,
now traffic manager of the food ad
ministration, has been suggested for
the place.
Highest Efficiency
Mr. Harrison's statement was Inter
preted as an answer to suggestions
for government operation of railroads.
It was given out at the railroad wir
board's offices and replied to declara
tions that the railroads have "broken
down" under the strain of war. After
asserting that the roads could not
be operated more efficiently under
different management. Mr. Harrison
said:
"The point of the whole matter is
that the ral'roads have been operate.i
with the highest efficiency and have
until now transported without sub
stantial complaint the greatest vol
ume of traffic In the history of the
countrv.
Financial Aid Necessary
"The roads under direction of t;-e
railroad war board are pr"pared with
out reervatlon to make common use
of facilities, power mid eouioment to
accomplish the highest measure of
success In the. transportation effort of
the country."
Members of the hoard feel that gov
ernment financial a'd is necessary.
A government loan, according to
the railroad men, would not relieve
the Immediate situation, but would he
of Incalculable va'uo if the war lasts
Ion? and traffic remains heavv. It Is
Impossible, thev say. to obtain from
hanks money for extension, because
the monev is eoing Into war material?.
Heavv shipments of cars and loco
motives to France and Russia have
causes domestic orders to be set
aide.

Raging Blizzard
Makes Halifax
Conditions Worse
( liy Review Leased Wire)
HALIFAX. N. S.. Dec. 7.- Stricken
Halifax was swepi tonight by a rac
ing blizzard. y: lierce wa-t the strom
that rescn workers were forced to
.suspend llieir opetaliuti.-i in Hie dev
astated section. It is believed certain
that all of the injured buried under the
ruins of siiattered buildings have per
ished of cold and hunger.
Battered by a biting wind and blind
ing snow, kth plight of the furvivirs of
yesterday's holocaust is little hhort of
desperate. The windows and doors 'of
virtually every house in the city were
shattered by the explosion which
wrecked the Richmond section and
devastated a lar;;e part of the water
front. Improvised barricades of boards
give little protection against the ele
ments and attempts to heat building?
into which the snow is steadily drift
ing are hopeless.
City in Darkness
The city Is again In darkness to
night excep; ior the illumination af
forded by a scanty supply of oil lamps
and puless these are carefully screen
ed, they are extinguished as soon as
lighted by the gale which whistles
thi'.iugh the crude shutters. Only a
small percentage of the buildings
have even this slight protection from
the storm.
The sufferings of those who es
caped injury have been increased by
tho fact tha: every available blanket,
quilt and comfort has been requisi
tioned for the hundreds of injured In
the temporary hospitals. Many of
these are so gra'e!y wounded their
only hope lies in the best jf care. Se
rious fears are felt that cold, shock
and exposure will result in an out
break of pneumonia.
Food Getting Scarce
Asingle telegraph wire, offered Hal
ifax only a precarious means of com
munication with the outside world and
it was feared momentarily that this
line Would snap. Telegraph and tele
phone ocmpanies are making desper
ate efforts to provide a make-shif serv
ice and the work is beset with great
difficulties.
While many offers of relief have
been received and tralnloaus or sup
plies are on the way, the spectre of
famine was abroad tonight, for if the
storm continues it may seriously in
terfere with railroad traffic. There
is "enough rood on hand for immedi
ate needs but it will last only a short
time unless additional supplies are re
ceived. As the day wore on the Immensity
of the disaster increased rather than
diminished. Hundreds of bodies were
taken to the morgues and rescue
squads were constantly finding new
victims buried under totns or debris
until the blizzard forced them to
cease work. There is every reason to
believe that many m'ore will be re
covered. No concerted effort has been made
as yet to compile a list of the dead,
as every effort is beinb made to iden
dition of many of the bodies makes
this exceedingly difficult and a large
portion of those who lost their lives
will be buried as "nameless dead."
There is no reason, however, to
change the estimate of 2000 dead and
2000 injured.
Business Is Suspended
While soldiers, sailors and volun
teers were searching the ruins of the
north end today, business was entire
ly suspended. The leading citizens de
voted their efforts to organizing work
of relief and substantial progress was
made in this respect.
An emergency meeting of the citi
zens was held at the city hall todya.
Lieutenant Governor Grant and Dep
uty Mayor Colwell presided. he
large audience listened with intense
interest and ringing applause to the
sheaf of telegram from far and near
which have poured In with messages
of sympathy and promises of assist
ance, much of which is on the way and
some already here. Two telegrams
came from the duke of Dovenshire,
g'overnor general of Canada, who Is
in Regina.
Calls to all the nearby towns which
were sent out yesterday for medical
aid and nurses were answered imme
diately. Mrs. Jesse Jones, director of wom
an's work. Washington. D. C offered
Red Cross supplies, asked for informa
tion as to what is most needed and as
sured special transportation.
The American ship in port offered
1 r6 blankets. The manager of the
terminals offered food and shelter for
200 persons.
Captain De Carteret, of the French
Cable company, said he would provide
a temporarv hospital. His ofTer may
be accented for the 80 inmates of the
deaf and dumb Institution, which it in
such a dangerous condition that it is
necessary to vacate It.
Evervone Is Helping
A reelstrv has been organized at
the city hall, where all the homeless
are asked to leave their names so that
the missing may he found, if possible.
A committee of women is being or
ganized to assist in relief work at the

president's advice was followed in a
demonstration of American unity and
harmony. Representative London, so-;
eialist of New York, who cast the one
negative vote, explained his opposi-,
tion by stating that he was pledg?dj
to that course by the socialist party.;
Caustic criticism of his position en-i
livened the house proceedings. I
Debate in both houses was unex
pectedly brief, lasting but an hour in;
tire, senate and 40 minute in tho
house. In sharp contrast to the dis-1
ct:ss;on which preceded the war dec-!
Juration against Germany last April,:
it was almost devoid of spectacular,
features in spite of the dramatic set-:
ting furnished by crowded gallerW.
Members apparently acted in commoi
accord to expedite action, the few!
who spoke refraining from extended
discussion.
Senate Acted First
The senate acted first on (he reso-j
lu'ion, presented by Chairman Stone;
with the unanimous indorsement of)
the foreign relations committee soon J
pfter the senate concluded routine:
business. After brief addresses by
Chairman Stone, Lodge r.nd Hitch-1
cock. Owen and Vardaman, the roll'
call followed. When the document!
was transmitted to the house it wisi
substituted there by unanimous ccn-
sent for the more lengthy resolution
reported by the house foreign rela
tions committee. Senators Stone,
who had charge of the resolution; I
Gronna of North Dakota, Norris cf)
Nebraska and Vardaman. who vot;lj
against the German declaration, today
joined the majority. A fifth, former
Senator Lane of Oregon, has since
died.
' Allies Must Ce orerste v.
Necessity for co-operative military
action of the allies was the principal
reason advanced in debate for pass
age of the Aos'rian resolution. Sen-!
ator Stone said that American troonsj
might soon fece Austrian forces j
through er.ter.sk n of the western:
front to Italy by the intcr-allied war:
council. He pointed out that the two)
natkms actually have been at war fori
months.
Urging unanimous indorsement of I
the resolution and depioring any ac-1
tion which might embarrass the presi
dent of en" effort to amend the reso
lution to include Turkey end Hulgarii, !
Sena or Lodge, senior mmber of the
foreign relations committee, gave rea
sons why, he said-, a majority of the
senate favored formal declarations
against Germany's other two allies.'
He indicated the Turkish government
was a curse to molern civilization, :

Heads of the es:press companies, :
before the interstate commerce cotn-j
mission today at t!i bearing on their!
application tcr an Increase of 10 perl
cent in rates, said the shippers under-
stand their need for higher rates fori
the war emergency and will present!
little objection. - . ' j
Before asking for air- 'itrvance. j
George C. Taylor, president of the
American Express company, told thei
commission that officials of the prin-;
cipal companies held conferences!
with commercial bodies and large'
shippers in a number of cities to ex-j
plain that higher revenues were im-1
pertive to save the companies from'
actual loss. In virtually every cane, j
Mr. Taylor said, the shippers were;
"sympathetic and appreciative of our;
needs." i
Only one shippers' representative:
appeared today to protest at the hear-!
ing. which will continue tomorrow.!
William A. Wimbish of Atlanta gave)
notice that on behalf of shippers of'
Atlanta, Nashville and Montgomery,!
he would object to increases. The
state railroad commissioners ask the:
commission for a nirnth in which to
analyze figures presented by the ex-
press companies to show greatly de
creased net income this year, and ac
tual loss by some companies. The
commission indicated it might allow
a week or two at most.
H. A. Stedman, vice president and!
general manager of the Wells-Fargoj
company, testified that shortage of
'abor had caused unusual expense to'
the express companies, owing not only I
to the necessity of paying higher
wages, but also to the increase in loss
end dnmace resulting from hiring in
experienced men. Added causes of
loss and damage, he said, were poor
parking by shippers, overloading of
cars, use of freight cars, and conges
tion at terminals.

Americans Are
Injured When
Huns Drop Bomb
(By Review Leased Wire.)
WITH THE AMERICAN ARMY IN
FRANCE, Dec. 7. A bomb dropped
by a German aviator during a recent
slight struck in the street of a town
through which two American avia
tion mechanicians, one from Detroit,
Mich., and the other from Buffalo.
Mo., were passing. The Detroit man
wag wounded in the shoulder and the
Missourian's nose was broken and he
receied other injuries to the face. At
the same time an ambulance driven
from Hannibal. Mo., was struck on
the back by a flying brick. The three
men are in a base hospital and thejr
condition is reported as not serious.
The men were half way through
the town when they heard bomos
dropping. They paused and heard th-i
whirr of propellers overhead. Imme
diately afterward a bomb fell nearby
and splinters fell In all directions. In
addition to wounding the Americans-,
two Fremh women were killed. .
One American in a hospital said he
bad learned his lesson, and that the
next time he hard the hum in of pro
pellers he would take to cover. In
the same todwn at the time of the
bomb dropping was an American cook
who was on a visit to show French
cooks how to make pie. The bombing
started before his lessons had been
completed. The cook disappeared, re
making later the cooks in that town
never would learn the art of pie
making from him.
A warning of the impending air raid
was given to all towns within a radius
cf many miles and all of them were
darkened.
Apple Tree Girl

'
"The Apple Tree Girl." produced b
the Edison company, will be shown
at the Orpheum theatre on Saturdi.y
and Sunday.
This feature from the Edison studios
is as breezy and refreshing as the
Connecticut hills in which the scene
is laid.
Charlotte Martin, left an orphan in
her early 'teens, works out her life's
problems in a way that many farther
along the road of life may well envy.
The contrast between her type and
that of the other girl in the story is
strongly drawn and the whole makes
a most interesting psychological
study.
Shirley Mason s the heroine is as.
always, appealing and charming, and
the rest of the cast, which includes
Joyce Fair, Jessie Stevens, Ray Mc
Kee and Paul Perez, is unusually well
chosen.

Not Win War
Frederic W. Zinn, of the French Av
iation Corps, in Leslie's Weekly:
Enthusiasts tell us that If the sky
could be swept clear of German' air
craft the war would be won, the road
to Berlin would be open. This is pure
fiction; If it were only the German
air fleet that was sapping them, the
allies would need to wait only until
the first rainy day to start on their
victorious march to Eerlin. A good
rain storm sweeps the Germans from
the skies as effectively as would 100,
000 allied airplanes; some times for
twj weeks at a stretch not an air
plane leaves the hangars, yet the sit
uation on the front remains un
changed. Such practical 'obstacles as barbed
wire, barrage fire and machine guns
must not be overlooked. Even artillery
observation is less dependent on avia
tion than most people think. Vor ac
?ura:e control against restricted objec
tives, especially at long range, air
planes may be a necessity; in other
cases airplane control may be de
sirable; but the mapority of the guns
:-an be very effectively directed from
ground observations. This appliot
particularly to the Germans.
The line of defense to which the
Germans fell back in 1911 was selected
icfore airplanes were a factor, and
.ho defensive streng.h of their po
sition is in no small measure Cue to
the continuous chain of excellent nat
ural observation points that they hold.
The Germans are still reaping the
benefits of their 1311 victories; o win
'.he war they need only to hold on to
ibe territory now in their possession:
hile the allies, if they are to win,
have the infinitely harder task of driv
ing the enemy back. The German air
service is. part of their system of de
ense. but it is only an auxiliary; con
crete, barbed wire, machine guns and
barrage fire are all primarily defensive
weapons which work for Germany no
matter who controls the air.
An allide or American . master" of
the air counts for absolutely nothing
unless they have the guns ami 'he
.hells and the troupes d"at'.aiue on
the spot, ready to do their part. It is
the humble "foot slogger" with his
bayonet and hand grenades that drives
.he enemy back.

STOCKS ARE DULL
NEW YORK, Dec. 7 Stocks weiv
heavy in the IV it half of today's
stagnant session, but made up part of
' their loss later, though closing with
a heavy tone. The movement was
the narrowest end le'ist important of
any day for many weeks, total deal
ings aggregating only 230.O00 shares.
The same Influences which so long
have served to check activity and ini
tiative were again operative. Foreign
news offered little encouragement and
: impending developments at Washing-
' ton were reflected in the hesitant tone
of industrials and war issues.
Ralls bore the brunt of the 'early
' reversal, and Investment stocks mak-
' in g- gross recessions of 1 to 2 points.
Yet new minimnms were reached by
Baltimore and Ohio at 4S and Penn
. sylvania at 44. selling of the latter
again suggesting urgent liquidation.
United States Steel was under press
' r most of the time, with other
; equipments, but rallied slightly in the
. last hour, only to fall back again.
International bonds were heavy.
! Anglo-French 5s establishing their
. lowest quotations at 89 . Liberty 4's
ranged from 97.16 to 97.30, and the
3's from 98.48 to 98.76. Total sales,
. par value, $3J50,000.
'United States- bonds, old issues,
were unchanged on call, registered
4's declining to 1 per cent on sale.
Oats finished 2' to 3c down and
; provisions were off 12 to 4,rc.
The ban on eastward shipments
started corn prices downward at
once. It was conceded on all sides
that the probable effect of the em
bargo would be to build up stocks
here and at other Important termi
nals, especially when the increasing
supply of cars in the rorn belt began
to exercise greater Influence. Gossip
was current that within a fortnight
the delivery of the entire total of
10.000 cars which the government had
ordered to the west would be com
pleted. The fact that the snowfalls
throughout the chief producing states
had not been of a character to Inter
fere with the curing of com acted
as a further bar to any important
rally. Liquidation by holders took
place on a large Rcale in the oats
market. The December option in par
ticular suffered in value.
Provisions fell with grain and
hogs. Government buying for Great
Britain and Belgium tended some
what to check the decline.

Congressman Carl Hayden, according to Major Kelly
of the Dorglas International, will not, under any circum
stances, be a candidate for the democratic nomination
for governor. So the major lines up the field as follows,
with apparently no favorite: Sydney P. Osborne, Fred
Colter, W. A. Mouer. Charles M. Shannon. Wiley E. Jones
and C. M. Roberts. Quite a list And the major avers
further that more candidates are available. His earnest
advice is not to name any man to head the democratic
ticket in the state next year whose principles, personali
ty or partisans would tend to continue the differences
that split the party last year. Hunt's violent prejudices
and extreme stand on vital matters split his party like a
coral reef splits a fishing smack on a surf bound coast
A really big man stands above Uiese things. And only
a big man "should be selected by his party to guide the
destinies of an entire state.
The American missionaries in Turkey are appealing
for help in the matter of funds and they are also in
danger of death at the hands of those they came to save.
For forty years the American missionaries have been
laboring in the Turkish field and spending money by tiie
thousands there. And all they have succeeded In doing
is to convert Armenians for the Turks to despoil and
slay. Statistics show hat about forty times daring the
part forty year1: the Turks have massacred the Armenians.
This editor Is not sure of his figures, but he would esti
mate that several million Armenians have been killed
thusly if the correspondents did not exaggerate. As fo
the Turk, he is the same today that he was yesterday
and a thousand years ago. He has his own God and
Mohammed is his prophet. He has his own little ways.
If a single Turk has been converted to Christianity since
the crusades of Per the Hermit, there is no authentic rec
ord of that fact Therefore The Review views with indif
ference the plea of the missionaries in Turkey. What
is needed in Turkey is bayonets and gunpowder; not
missionaries.
The devil has written another letter to the kaiser,
and. according to Eugene H. Blake of the Vigilantes, this

who has been here sirce 1701. "Kidd," I told him, "Wil
helm of Prussia is in trouble. He offers extra pay, longer
furloughs, and special food to German sailors to man his
submarines, but they don't like the work. Here's a chance
for a good job. You can take your crew up, command a
German ttbmarine and sink more ships in a day than
' you ever destroyed in your lifetime." He seemed to Tike
the idea until he had talked with some of his crew Bath
olomew Roberts, who came' down in 1722 after his battle
with Captain Clialoner on the African coast. Captain Ev
ery and a Malay pirate who is an especial friend of Kldd's.
Finally he came back to me and said he wouldn't go. I
told him you were one ot my best friends and helpers,
but all I could get out of him was that his crew would
mutiny If they had to kill women and children. "Wil
helm's submarining is too dirty," he kept repeating. "I'd
rather stay in Hades." I'm sorry I haven't bceu able
to send you a crew from here, but that is the way the
matter stands. Yours for victory, Beelzebub.
Every day and every day's events bring the war closer
home to all citizens of this natioo. The first army draft
skimmed the main group of citizenship, taking only tbe
cream of the young men fit to go and able to be spared
from home. Before that many thousands bad volunteer
ed. The next draft will press down closer. And the next
draft will go to the bone. Every great event In Europe
has its bearing on tbe war for America. The Russian
collapse will, it is estimated, cost America a half million
men. The Italian retreat will rovt many thousands more.
The withdrawal of the Kritisli before the Camhrai .ouut
er attacks will cost thousands more. Each one ot tl.ese
events gives Germany just that much moro confideuce
and ability to resist. Closer and closer we draw to the
maelstrom. This nation is at war. but not unMl this
time next year will we fully realize it. Germany is as
strong aDd vicious toddy as she ever was. We have yet
our part to play in tJie same. The more we can come to
realize K now the better will be our condition to 0j ef
fective work later and bring about a quicker and cheaper
ending of It all. Every strike, every propaganda, every
ivoidance of duty to the government, every deaf ear

our play are we known tor or against the winning of the
war as soon as needs be. Later, when Uie casualty lists

OUR NEWEST AMERICANS.
Reinette Lovewell writes of Porto Rico's patriotism
as follows:
All by its lonesome clown in the Carribean Sea. the
little island of Porto Rico knows there is a war going
on and is right on the job. For in spite of all its Spanish
names and customs, and the fact that half our folks
don't know it Porto Rico is United States. The Stars
and Stripes have been flying over the government build
ings since 1898 and when war was forced upon Washing
ton last spring, every Spanish-language paper on the is
land came out and declared that whatever might come,
the Porto Rican populace was going to stand by the great
country five days to the north.
The tragic 'tiling about Porto Rico is that she isn't
big enough to be a republic by herself. Ever since their
first taste of liberty in 1898 that has been the dream
of her people; but the whole Island is only about the
siie of Massachusetts with Cape Cod cut off and has al
ways bad a hard time to make a living. Self-government
is plainly out of the question; Porto Rico seems destined
to be the ward of Washington for generations to come.
You can rake the island over from San Juan to Ponce
and not find a sign of a Pacifist or a Conscientious Ob
jector. Like their neighbors in the West Indies and the
South American Republics. Porto Rirans just naturally
like being in hot water. They are as good scrappers as
the Irish, albeit in a Latin way, and when the war broke
they began to strain at the leash to fight for the Flag
that has protected them for nineteen years. The boys
were eager to get into the United States navy and men
of military age rushed to join the regular regiment. This
regiment, recruited to full strength, is now doing service
in Panama, where climatic conditions are so similar. An
officers' training camp as started lit Cavey and more
applications received than could be taken" care of.
When news came that there was to be a draft, no
outcry was heard. Impetuous and inflammable as the
Porto Rican Is temperamentally, he said not one word
against this iron rule of sacrifice. And this in face of
the undeniable truth that he has not come to us, but we
have invaded his homeland and with Yankee enterprise
tried to hustle him out of comfortable, climatic habits.
Porto Rico has taken $1,000,000 in Liberty bonds
when money loaned down there brings eight per cent in
terest. An up-and-coming Liberty Loan Committee was
organized early in the summer and worked indefatigably
to get subscriptions.
In her own tropical way the island is doing a big bit
Tor the American Red Cross. Who that has sampled
guava Jelly cannot taste it yet? At the headquarters of
the Porto Rico Chapter, the familiar window card with
its scarlet emblem is lettered "CRUZ ROJA," and in a
huge room with a blue-and-white tiled floor, twenty-two
charcoal braziers are used to make jelly for the hospitals
of Europe. In a single day enough Is made to fill more
than a thousand glasses, but most of it is being prepared
for shipment in gallon cans. As the guavas spoil quickly
the women are working all day Sunday. Sugar made
right on the Island is used the Porto Rican spirit being
shown in the fact that one of the great sugar companies
contributed 24.000 pounds. A little later grape fruit mar
malade will be made in huge quantities. ,
The list of members of the Insular Red Cross Chapter
contains names like Miguel Guerra Mondragon and Rafael
Gonzales Pesquera, lined up beside a plain American sig
nature like J. R. Cobb.
The island took the Food Question wfth all serious
ness. The slogan, "We Must Keed Ourselves," was given
out and the first crop census shows that Porto Rico, with
the exception of a few staples, can really feed herself.
The Porto Rico Progress, the only all-English news
paper on tbe island, says editorially:
"If we can feed ourselves we can help feed a lot
of others and just at the present time a Urge pari
of the world needs to be fed."
So. although they do uot live with us, and have seen
our folks cliasiiig their dollars away from them ever
since 1898, our newest Americans are giving service now,
when we need them, aud not mauana, when it will be
too late.
According to Secretaiy of State Osborns report, is
sued recently, 'there are nearly twenty thousand auto
mobiles lu Arizona. When it is considered that the state's
population Is about. SGfMMtn, this is a splendid showing
or prospcrliy ud progress. One automobile to every
sixteen people is a per capita of plutocracy not to lie
sneezed at Maybe Pittsburg, the millionaire city, can
beat it; maybe not. Anyway, the dry farmer, the randi
er, the miner and Mr. Arizona Business .Man in General,
are riding around in style these pleasant winter days.
It was not so very long ago when the Apache and the
c o -puncher rode the fcttive broncho over tin trails of
this state and the prospector spurred the patient burro.
Tweuty thousand autos represent a cash outlay of at
j least twelve uiillious of dollars for vehicle transportation.

Little Daughter of W. G. Mc
Bride and Wife, Formerly

The Phoenix Republican o" Wednes
day morning contains an article re
garding the death of Jean Mc Bride,
the little five-year-old daughter of W.
G. McHride and wife, who were for
mer residents of this district. Mr.
and Mrs. McBride were first located
at Cananea and then came to this
city and resided for some time here,
and when the Courtland district
opened he was in charge of the oper
ations there on the Great Western
property. From there they went to
Mammoth and thence to Morenci, an I
then to Globe. The many friends of
the couple in this district extend their
most heartfelt sympathy in the hour
of their untimely loss. The article
is as follows:
"Laughingly from the arms of her
parents, with fullest childish trust In
all of her surroundings, little Jean
McBride, five years of age, went all
unconsciously to her death upon i
surgeon's table Wednesday morning.
The shock and unutterable anguish

death before their eyes in the most
unexpected form. Ether poisoning.

"Little Jean came here with her pa
rents, Mr. and Mrs. W. G. McBride,
from Globe on Monday morning. Th-i
child had been troubled for some time:
with swollen tonsils. Globe physician
had advised a slight operation for her
relief. The child strongly objected to
an operation under the hands of other
than the family physician, between
whom and the little one there had al
ways been a strong bond of affection.
"Mr. McBride having decided to come
here from Globe, where he is manager
of the Old Dominion Copper company.
to attend the meeting of the Arizona
chapter of the American Mining Con-
rress decided that the visit would at
ford opportunity for the operation,
and therefore brought the little girl
over with Mrs. McBride. Monday the
child spent at the home of the physi
clan, and Wednesday morning arose
to play about in her usual high spirit.
and apparently in the best of physicnl
condition. Attended by her parents.
she went to the operating table more
in the spirit of happy, adventure than
otherwise. Ether was administered
and the slight operation quickly per
formed. The shock came when the
little one failed to rally from the
anaesthetic. All knon to science
was done with the utmost skill to ef
fee restoration, but to no avail. Mrs.
Mcl.'ride was near pros rated from
grief and shock, from which her hus
band and the surgeon were hardly
less overcome. When the news wa?
conveyed to Mr. McBride's associates
and iriends in the mining confirecs.
it carried a deep sense of personal
af dirt ion, attended by expressions ol
the utmost sympathy.
"The little girl was the only child
of Mr. and Mrs. McBride. Possessed
of an ever-sunny disposition, she was
a favorite with all who came in con,
nct with her. Mr. and Mrs. -Mc
Bride left Thursday night for Giodi
with the body. Funeral services and
interment took place there Friday.
"A difoatch from Globe Wednes
day night said that the news of the
tragic occurrence had been received
there with expressions of deep sym
pathy throughout the community. Al
though Mr. and Mrs. McBride ha.e
been residents there for but a few
months, having come from Morenci.
where be was assistant manager witt.
the Detroit Copper company, they had
minded much in social circles huh
public affairs of the district, always
accompanied by their little daughter,
who bad won general acquaintance
and affection among the many friends
made by the parents."
Koch Sentenced
to Serve Not Less
Than25 Years
Man Who Shot T. R. Brandt
In Tombstone While At
tempting to Rob Bank
Pleads Guilty Tells Long
Tale.
Fred H. Koch, who attempted to rob
the First National Bank of Tomb
stone on November 3rd and shot T. R.
Brandt the cashier, was yesterday
sentenced by Judge Otis J. Baughn,
to serve a term of not less than 25
years and a maximum of life. Koch
entered a plea of guilty to the charge
ol an assault with intent to commit
murder. He was then taken before
Justice of the Peace Fowler on Wed
nesday to be given preliminary exam
ination, but he waived the hearing and
was held to answer to the superior
court An information was filed at
once by County Attorney RTjss and be
was taken into court this morning.Lee (
Woolery was appointed by the court to j
represent him. When told to stand up
and asked by the court if he had any
thing to say why - judgment of the
court should not be pronounced
against him, he replied that he did. He,
then began the recital of a narrative
that took nearly an hour to deliver. He
stated that D. V. Williams, who has a
little ranch near Gleason. has been the
cause or his downfall and thac it was
Williams who directed him to come to
Tombstone and rob the bank and that
Williams had directed him to commit
other crimes, such as stealing whiskey,
autotires, selling whiskey and a num
ber of other crimes and that if the of
ficers would make an investigation
and search the premises of Williams
that they would find a number of
stolen articles hidden about the place.
From the time he started until he
finished he did not hesitate, but went
righ: along, and it gave those who
heard him the belief that he was
either telling the truth or had taken
considerable time in rehearsing the
sfjry. The tale that he told was given
under oath and was taken down by
Court Reporter John W. Walker and
will be transcribed. The sheriffs of
fice and the county attorney s office
have begun work already in making an
investigation of the statement made
hv Koch and if It is found to be cor
roborated in the least Williams will
bo placed under arrest.
When Koch had completed his
story. Judge Baughn then pronounced
sentence and he had no sooner finish
ed the words than Koch fell over in a
faint and then began to rave like a
crazy man and haf to be carried out
of the court room." For several days
last week and the first part or ws
week Koch had been trying to sham
insanity but his 'ork was not smooth
enough, as the sheriffs office was
watching his actions. He will be
taken at once by representatives of
the sheriff's office to the penitentiary
at Florence.

PASSED BAD CHECKS
Advices have been received here
that C. F. Cole, who served a term

former resident of this city. Cole has
been in the bootlegging business for
some time and the officers at Tucson
found a cache at his ranch just out

The process of heating water for domestic purposes has been rev
olutionized in the past few years through the introduction and
perfection of gas fired water heaters, until today it is no longer a
a problem to secure an abundance of hot water quickly and econo
mically, in any dwelling, large or smalL
Today, in the countless thousands of homes where gas Ered water heaters are in
stalled, an abundance of hot water is available for any purpose. By some types of heat
ers the water is heated instantly at the turn of a faucet, by others, within a few min-
utes after fighting the heaters, and all without labor, inconvenience or discomfort ind
at a reasonable cost for gas.

from Kerensky, the former premier, in
which the following passages occur:
"Do you not see that jVmr frankness
is being made use of and that you are
being deceived? You were promised
peace with the Germans within three
days. Where is it? Where is the lib
erty which was promised you?
'It is dishonorable, infamous. Fools!

For eight months I safeguarded the
