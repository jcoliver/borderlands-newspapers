tions constitution as now framed J
promised to provide a dramatic cli
max at the close of the sixty-fifth con
gress. Republican Leader Lodge to
night prepared a resolution proposing,
first, that the senate declare that the
present league draft be not approxed,
and second that the American peace
commissioners be - urged to proceed
immediately with the work of conclud
ing peace "with' Germanv.
This unexpected jmove by the re
publican leaders, .designed primaril
as a means of formally notifying the
peace Conference and the country as
to the- views, of many members of the
new. senate .an this subject, followed
many hours debate of the league con
stitution in the senate and brief ad
dresses in the house. In the senate
the constitution was attacked by Sen
ator Sherman of Illinois, republican,
and defended by Senator McCumber
of. North Dakota, a republican mem
ber of the foreign relations commit
tee. Mann Indorses Plan
Republican Leader Mann opened the
discussion in the house. Wiile not
specifically endorsing the league plan
as proposed, Mr. Mann declared the
war would have been fought in rain
if some move was not taken to pre
vent future wars. His statement was
applauded by the democratic mem
bers. Later Representative Norton of
North Dakota, republican, .who re
turned recently from Europe, Toiced
his approval of the league and prais
ed President Wilson as the recognized
leader in the movement for a world
society. - - -
After Senator Lodge had prepared
his resolution, republican leaders cir
culated a pledge of support which
was to be held in reserve . in the
event that no action was had on the
resolution. It was said tonight that
this pledge had the signatures of 33
senators-eiect to the new congress.
One republican leader also made the
statement that support of 40 republi
can members had been promised.
No republicans whose terms expire
tomorrow and no democrats, it was
said, were beine: asked to sign the
declaration of adherence. If the res
olution is brought to vote, however,
the republican leaders hope to secure
the support of several democrats who
are known to oppose the present
league draft. .1

The resolution prepared by Senator

it was reported, by the republican
leader, with the co-operation of Sen
ator Knox of Pennsylvania. It also
w as prepared in lieu of a more lengthy
declaration, which previously had
been circulated, demanding amend
ment of the league constitution 60 as
to specifically provide for protection
of Monroe doctrine and; other funda
mental principles.
As a result of the conference, how-'
ever, the resolution was reduced to
a declaration of opposition to the
league charter as now framed, and in
favor of hastening the peace treaty.
If the resolution should be defeated
and the republicans felt that it prob
ably would be, minority leaders said
they believed the alternative state

APPROPRIATION FOR
STATE FAIR BRINGS
DEBATE IN HOUSE
Amount Provided Cut After
Lengthy Argument in
Hot Session
(By Review Leased Wire)
PHOENIX. Ariz.. Mar. 3 The ap
propriation for the state fair at Phoe
nix started a lengthy argument in the
house this afternoon when the differ
ent sections of the appropriations bill
came up. A strong sentiment was de
veloped to do away with the fair al
together this year, owing to condi
tions of unemployment, which were
painted by some in alarming colors.
The majority, however, favored the
fair-a reduced appropriation and this
was done, the total grant for the two
years being cut from $95,000 to $60,
000. The debate brought out a wide
divergence of opinion on the ques
tion of unemployment. Bad and get
ting worse was the analysis of one
section of the house; mildly serious;
but only temporarily so, was the con
tention of the others.
Favors Abolishment
Somebody said that the gate re
ceipts "taken in at the fair paid only
cne-tenth of the expenses and Imme
diately Vyne moved that the appro
priations be cut out. -
"This motion will abolish the state
fair," said Galbraith.
"That is the intention," replied
Vyne. "This year we must have re
trenchment and jncney must be spem
where it will do most good in provid
ing work for the unemployed."
Then' Phillips explained:
"There is a misunderstanding," said
he. "It is not true that the fair re
ceipts pay only one-tenth the ex
penses. There has been only a very
tmall appropriation needed in other
years to make up the deficiency."
Motion Called Absurd
"This is one of the most absurd mo
tions ever introduced in the house,
was Little's contribution to tho de
bate. "The appropriation is not un
reasonable. The state fair is a great
institution and should not be abol
ished."
Then Delbridge drew a picture of
unemployment, of mines shut down;
and men laid off, greater taxes for the
worker and less for the producing
companies, to point his argument that
the fair should be suspended this year.
"The working man is facing the
rroblem of finding bread and butter,"
said Delbridge. "This fair appropria
tion will not help solve the unemploy
ment riddle. We do not propose to do
away with the fair, tut this year it
should be dispensed with and the mon
ey put into the roads. Further, I want
to say that there seems to be some
thing .wrong with the. management ,of
the faif There w as a g'rfM -f us Qade
two. years ago about-themagnificenl
mineral exhibit -which .was being pre
pared. Today that magnificent exhibit
is lying on the ground with the cases
which contained it. This is no year
to spend money that way."
Argues for Fair
Galbraith said all the valuable
mineral specimens which had been
collected for the fair had been return
ed to their owners or preserved, and
that what had'- been thrown away
were exhibits which had been used by
some stock selling companies..-
"I have been fighting to have appro
priations cut down," said Galbarrtn,
"and not a bit of support have I re
ceived till this estimate for the fair
came up. Our appropriations this ses
sion run 5800,000 more than the last,
and added to that is a highway bill
carrying a million, and a half. Let us
cut down our appropriations, but why
make the whole cut at the expense of
the fair?"
Barrows, who was absent from the
house owing to illness and who took
his place today in a wheelchair, saw
no cause for alarm in the unempoly
ment situation.
"We are not going to have famine
in this state," he declared. . "We are
going to have a slight period of de
pression during readjustment from a
war to a peace basis, but there are go
ing to be plenty of gtfod jobs for good
men. Let us practice decent economy,
let us not waste money, but let us not
be penurious."
On the vote Vynes motion to sus
pend the fair grant this year was lost
and the estimate was reduced to ?60.
000 for two years.

DREAM GOMES TRUE
AS BURGLARS LOOT
STORE OF ITS STOCK
Robbers Carry Off Merchan
dise Valued at $4,000;
Overlook Finery
Evidently making nse of a small
trcuk, burglars early Sunday morning
entered the store of Luis G. Sena, in
Naco road and carried off sufficient
xoods to stock op another store. The
robbery occurred within a stone's
throw of the county building and the
police station and although a front
window was broken out to accomplish
an entrance, the robbery was not dis
covered until after daylight on Sun
day when a passerby found the place
open and notified the proprietor, who
lives almost adjoining the store and
in the rear.
Mrs. Sena had just finished telling
her husband of a dream she had had
during the night in which she saw a
strange man taking a handhome skirt,
which was her personal property, from
where it was hanging in the store".
Also she told of having heard a car
in front of the place during thenight,
but had thought it a part of her dream.
Loss Is $4,000
Investigation, showed that the little
store had been ransacked - and
Sena placed his loss at more than
$4,000, while the police and county of
licers are of the opinion that the ac
tual Aoss is not far. below this amount.
Included in the stuff known to .have
been taken, which, perhaps constitutes
the heaviest single item .are 75 pairs
of mens' and womens shoes. Other
larg items are 200 pounds of coffee
and 206 pounds of sugar. Dozens of
siik waists are in the loot as well as
silk scans and silk handkerchiefs. A
number, of womens suits were in
cluded and many dozen linen hand
kerchiefs and napkins and table linen.
Overlook Finery
The Btock of pert ornery and toilet
waters was almost depleted. One thing
that was intentially overlooked was
a chest of expensive linen, consist
ing of embroidery and Mexican drawn
work. In order to prevent the expen
sive material from becoming soiled.
Mrs. Sena had placed cheaper goods
over the top. The burglars threw off
some of tue cheaper stuff and then
cast tue chest asiJe. Hay they gone
a littie deeper they would have found
the finery and several hundred dol
lars would have been added to the
loss.
Cigars and cigarettes were also
taken and considerable canned goods
veie missing from the shelves. It
was announced that" the amount of
groceries earned off cannot be closely
estimated, but amounted to several
hundred dollars.
In the opinion of the officers, an
ordinary automobile would "not have
been able to carry of all of the plunder
at one load. For this reason it is
thougnt that a truck was used or more
than one outomobile. Mrs. Sent in
telling of the affair, said that she
heard a car out in front at about 3
o'clock Sunday morning . She thought
nothing of it and after looking across
the rear yard to the stare and seeing
things apparently all right, she re
turned to bed.
Entrance was perfected by break
ing out a glass in the front door and
then turning the lock from the inside.
The glass at the side door had first
been tampered with as shown by
marks on the glass and the door. It
was discovered, however, that this
door was protected by a second lock
that could not be opened without the
key, so their efforts there were aban
doned. .
Sena is of the opinion that the rob
bers succeeded in getting across the
border and thatN the stolen property
will be disposed of in Mexico. The
police are working to locate the rob
bers and the property, but are of the
opinion that Sena is correct in his
, theory- The amount of goods taken,
it is pointed out, would stock dip a
rather pretentious store in Mexico.

Judging from the countless prepara
tions and treatments which are contin
ually being advertised for the purpose
of making fhin people fleshy, develop
ing arms, neck and bust, and replacing
ugly hollows and angles by the soft
curved lines of health and beauty,
there are evidently thousands of men
and women who keenly feel their ex
cessive thinness.
Thinness and weakness are usually
due to starved nerves Our bodies
need more phosphate than is contain
ed in modern foods. Physicians claim
there is nothing that will supply this
deficiency so well as the organic phos
phate known among druggists as bitro
phosphate," which is inexpensive and
is sold by J. M. Ball in Bisbee and
most all' druggists under a guarantee
of satisfaction or money back. By
feeding the nerv?s directly and by
supplying the body cells with the
necessary phosphoric food elements,
bitro-phosphate quickly produces a
welcome transformation in the appear
ance; the increase in weight frequent
ly being astonishing.
This increase In weight also carries
with it a general improvement in the
health. Nervousness, sleeplessness and
lack of energy, which nearly always
accompany excessive thinness, soon
disappear, dull eyes become bright,
and pale cheeks glow with the bloom 4
of perfect health. - -CAUTION:
Although bitro-phos
phate is ' unsurpasseod for relieving
nervousness, sleeplessness and gen-,

to its remarkable flesh-growing prop-'

not desire to put on flesh. Adv.

The White House Knows
We find the following new Item regarding the president's arrival
In Boston frcm Europe on the S. S. George "Washlnfton:
"The president left behind him a pair of tortoise shell spec
tacles which appeared to be his favorite glasses, as Secretary Tumulty
sent a message by radio to have the ship searched for them. They
were found tn his . stateroom, and Chief Water Tender I O. Jones
is going to Washington now as a special messenger to convey the
eye-glasses to the White House."
From which it Is apparent . that when the White House wants
reasonably quick communication. Instead of using Mr. Eurleson's in
competent and annoying telegraph and telephone service, it uses the
radio, and when it repuires prompt delivery of a package, instead of
using Mr. Burleson's parcel post, it is compelled to resort to special
messenger service. The ordinary citizen, however, has not a radio
at his command, nor can he afford special messenger service.
The 1919 Humpty-Dumpty
One political group in Germany must be given credit for picking
out a man's size job, and a task that will leave no room for criticism
on the laziness score. This group is striving to put the ex-kaiser back
on the job. Surely that Ib no easy task to set for a handful of Germans!
It reminds us of the old nursery rhyme concerning a certain Humpty
Dumpty, who fell from the wall, and it is recalled.
"All the king's horses and all the king's men, . " .
"Couldn't put Humpty-Dumpty together again."
The ex-kaiser has fallen from his pedestal, and nowadays when
"king's men" are hard to find, restoring Humpty-Dumpty would be mere
child's play compared with the attempt to put Bill Hohenzollern 'back
on the walL"
The counts in the indictment of the former German ruler are too
numerous to recount, but one thing has followed another, with each
new discovery making him less popular with the people Jie led to the
slaughterhouse.
When the war ended, he had enough provisions stored away to last
him, the six little Hohenzollerns, and the remainder of his family for
a hundred years, according to the- report of Wilhelm Carle, member
of the workmen's-soldiers' council in Berlin. According to this report,
when the. Hohenzollern premises were searched, there were found,
"Meat, game in ice, salted provisions in large cases, whale meat in sacks
piled up to the roof, thousands of eggs, gigantic basins filled with lard,
coffee, tea, chocolate, jelly and jam of every kind, hundreds of sugar
loaves, peas, beans, dried fruits and biscuits."
In American money these foodstuffs were worth more than 120,000
wholesale at pre-war prices. Holding these while the rest of Germany
went hungry won't make it any easier for Humpty's friends to put
Humpty Bill Hohenzollern together again.
And They Said There Were No "Cave Men ' Now!
Mrs. Thomas H. Gadsil, of Chicago, testifying in court, complains
that her husband "hit me on the head with a hammer, and never even
apologized." So inconsiderate of hhn! But then we suppose that a few
taps on the head with a hammer are too insignificant an occurrence
these days to demand an apology.
Practical Patriotism
It Is the experience of th.e public that when some new commodity
comes on the market and is hugely successful, several imitations of the
genuine article shortly appear. Quickly following on the heels of the
popularity of the "original and only genuine." a half-dozen "just as good"
offerings are made.
As in the case of many other things, patriotism suddenly becomes
a popular commondity in America. Whem the United States first en
tered the war, real patriots sprung up on every hand. But no sooner
had the general public begun to uncover real, though long smouldering
and nearly dead, patriotism, then spurious Imitations of the real thing
Appeared. So many bogus varieties were brought forth, that it was
difficult even for the most genuinely sincere man to tell the real thing
when he met it. But nearly all has some brand or other of "patriotism."
With the end of the war, the real test of the patriot arrived
And a good many of us are carelessly throwing off the outer garment of
love for country and returning to our old selfish careers. Too many had
the sort or patriotism which, like the imitation dye-stuff, fades with
wear and washing. It doesn't stand the acid test.
Of what avail was all our so-called patriotism during the War if it
is to be shed at the first oppurtunity, as the snake sheds its skin? Of
what avail to subscribe billions in war loans, donate more billions to
war relief, put forth our best efforts in industrial lines, and save and
scrimp that our soldiers might have proper care and attention, if we are
to neglect, them now?
We must remember that our soldiers are as much heroes, every one
of them, now that the war is won, as they were when the fighting
was still in progress. But do we? How many now 6how the respect that
they paid to the men in uniform last summer?
A returned soldier was overheard to remark: "While the fighting
was going on, we were heroes; now we are bums." His may tn: an ex
treme case, but nevertheless a true one. Hailed as one of the men
w ho were to help save democracy, he was honored and respected by all.
Great was the talk of the rewards that were to be his after the battles
were won. Now he is one of the many men looking for a job. and is
considered just that and nothing more by too many people. Too many
find it easy to forget the promises made our fighting men. Too many
shrug their shoulders and say. "well, the industrial problem will re
adjust itself in time, so why worry? Let some one else care for the
returning men."
There is truth in the statement that the industrial problem will re
adjust itself after a while. This great country will come through the
period of reconstruction successfully, in the end a better country for
everyone of the trials it has had to face.
But in the meantime we must not shift the whole burden upon the
soldier. He has borne his share of the work already. Let us provide
jobs for him. let us show him that we really meant we were back of him
when he went out to give his all if need be for his nation.
Here iu Arizona we boast of a proud record a record of leading In
Liberty loan subscriptions! of being at the head of the draft list; of
leading in the proportion of volunteers for service; of standing at the
top in the matter of Red Cross and other relief donations. Let us con
tinue to lead all the states in patriotism patriotism of the genuine, dyed-in-the-wool
brand of a practical nature, that accomplishes things. Let
Arizona be foremost in recognizing the rights of the returned soldier,
as she was in recognizing the country's need In the great crisis so
recently passed.
That is practical patriotism work that will benefit the cation not
only in war ut in peace, and benefit the men who served their country
in its time; of trial.

Marse Henry's Jubilee
Henry Watterson, editor emeritus of the Louisville Courier-Journal,
and one of the foremost editors of modern times, is celebrating his jubi
lee this week. For fifty years he has edited newspapers, since the civil
war days standing out as the leading exponent of the "old school" of
journalism.
Familiarly known to millions of readers as "Marse Henry," this
distinguished writer is at once one of the best-liked and most powerful
writers of his time. His writings today carry the same power and
"punch" that made him famous whon, in civil war times, he edited a
newspaper established in a plant on a flat car, moved from place to
place as the necessities of the time dictated.
More than 200 men and women of distinction are paying him trib
ute thi3 week in a special edition of his newspaper, among them being
Lloyd George, Arthur James Balfour, Andre Tardieu, American Peace
Commissioners White, Bliss, Lansing and House, General Pershing,
William Howard Taft, Admiral Sims and many other famous characters.
It is seldom that a newspaperman attains to the height reached by
"Marse Henry." The editorial columns of a newspaper are necessarily
Impersonal, yet he managed to inject into his writings a quality which
made him the most quoted of all the editorial writers of the past five
decades, and carried his personality straight to the hearts of his many
readers.
He is known as the dean of newspaper men, and properly so. News
paper men everywhere, frcm the greatest publishers and editors to the
youngest cub reporter, know and admire his work, and respect the man.
The newspaper world and the world in general would be the better
if there were more of his kind.
Uncle Sam's Newest Hotel
A new hostelry suddenly has appeared at Washington. The once
dignified and staid chambers of the United States senate became last
Saturday night the scene of a novel, if somewhat undignified, occurrence.
Army blankets the kind that covered our boys in France were
brought in by solons who wished to doze while others carried on an all
night debate in an effort to prevent action on the Victory loan bill.
Extra chairs were provided for those who desired to sleep. The senate
chamber became a huge barracks housing an army of men gathered
ostensibly for the purpose of carrying on the business of the nation.
Can you picture your favorite senator, accustomed to the luxuries
of the best hotels, dozing in a chair with his feet propped up on another,
his body swathed in an army blanket? It might remind jsome of a
fashionable churCh in a big city, with the same senators napping while
the clergyman preached his sermon, the speakers on the floor of the
senate playing the role of pastor. It all would be very laughable indeed,
were its purpose not to delay action on important legislation, and force
an adjournment of congress before needed laws could be enacted.
Exit the U-Boat
A short while ago, as time is reckoned, the world was astounded
by the merciless sinking of passenger ships by submarines. ' For years
.the efforts of nations were concentrated on a weapon-to defeat the sea
snake that lay in wait for its defenseless victims, to send them to their
deaths and then slink away as they perished. Now all that is to end.
One of the terms of the final peace treaty is to include the abolishment of
submarine warfare by all countries. The world wants iio more of its
horrors.
Regardless of whether the covenant of the proposed league of nations
is accepted by the great powers, the doom of the U-boat is sealed. In
a comparatively short time it will have run the gauntlet from being
a menace to civilization to being a memery of days gone by. So exits
one of the most dramatic and most horrible inventions of man.
At some future date no doubt, mothers will drop the time-honored
"boogey-man" scare for the more modern, "Hush, or the bolsheviki'U

Cheer up Even living In a bone-dry state has its advantages. None

And now a group of former-prohibition workers are advocating a
national amendment abolishing the use of tobacco in all its forms. In
the meanwhile it has been ascertained that one-fourth of the women
students at Vassar smoke, and in London the Y. W. C- A? is split over

Twelve feet of snow in the Cascade mountains and a temperature of

have learned that the conference "resumed its deliberations."

brought a bill into the senate today
to levy a strong tax on peddlers. $75
payable quarterly where the peddler
or hawker does not use a Vehicle, and
?200 quarterly when he does use a
vehicle. These taxes would apply only
ror one county and would be repeated
as often as the peddler passed the
county borders.
The measure providing for direct
primaries or primary assemblies was
rushed through two readings in the
senate and sent to the committee ot

A forecast of. a fight on the -rmy

that they do not pass.

BY REVIEW
NEW YORK, March 3. The week
in the stock market opened with an
otner broad speculative inquiry, rails
sharing liberally In the general ad
vance, which assumed its most sub
stantial proportions .however in spe
cialties representing the motor indus
try. Strengthening of local bank re
reserves and latest political and indus
trial developments helped to sustain
the bull movement. Ttjere was a
slight fall off in western railroad ton
nage and further uncertainty in that
section regarding trade conditions. v
United States Steel provided the
market's firmest foundation making
an extreme advance of 2hi points to
944, losing only a fraction at the
close.
Tobaccos and oil stocks yielded part
of .their one to four point rise. Mexi
can tetro.eum and Royal Dutch falling
back in the final hour.
Low priced rails Including Western
Pacific common and preferred. Rock
Island, Colorado Southern, Pittsburg
and West Virginia, were no less
strong than issues of the caliber of
Reading and Canadian Pacific, but
shipping and coppers were backward.
Sales amounted to 775,000 shares.
Foreign bonds held steady but the
several domestic - groups, including
Liberty issues were irregular within
restricted limits. Total sales, par
value, aggregated $13,000,000. Old
United States were unchanged on call.

GRAIN MARKET
CHICAGO, March 3. Corn advanc
ed in value today, chiefly owing to
belief that the $17.50 minimum hog
price would be maintained during
March. The close, although unsettled
was to lc net higher with May
$1.26 to $1.26 and July $1.22 to
$1.22. Oats finished 4c net
up. Provisions gained 25 to 65 cents.
Bullish sentiment dominated the
corn market throughout the day.
There ' was a good sized decrease in
the visible supply total as against
an increase a year ago.
Oats ascended with corn. Receipts
were small and the country not sell
ing. Strength of hogs and corn lifted
pro , lslqns. Big exports counted fur
ther as' a bullish factor. Hog arrivals
at western points were not over plen
