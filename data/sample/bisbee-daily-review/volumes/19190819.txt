OFTHESHANTUNG MESS, EXPERTS
SAMES. BEFORE SENATE TODAY
President at Public Meeting to Tell of The Peace 'Treaty's
"Behind the Scenes" Setting; Will Be Closely Quizzed As
To the Shantung Settlement; Japan Can Only Be Ousted
From China By Force of Arms, Expert Tells U. S. Senate
WASHINGTON. Aug. 18. At a con-
erence in some respects unparalleled
in American history, President Wilson
will talk over the peace negotiations
and the treaty with the senate foreign
relations committee tomorrow at the
White House. By virture of extraordi
nary plans to inform the public of
every word that is spoken, the meet
ing will have the aspect of an open
forum discussion at which the while
nation can look on.
Many Questions for President
As head of the American peace dele
gation and one of the inner circle
which formulated the world settle
ment at Versailles the president Is to
be asked the meaning and purpose of
provisions of the league of nations'
covenant, the reasons behind the de
cision to give Japan control in Shan
tung province, just what part (he
United States is to take in reconstruc
tion and many other questions raised
In senate consideration of the treaty.
Whether Mr. Wilson will answer ful
ly In so public a manner all the ques
tions put to him or will consider that
some of the Information he received
at the peace table should be held in
confidence as a matter of national
policy remmains conjecture, but the
committee means to give him the op
portunity If he choose to tell the story
behind the treaty.
Tells of Shantung Deal
Today the committee heard its first di
rect account of Shantung negotiations
from Thomas F. Millard, an American
writer, who acted as advisor to the
Chinese peace delegation. He said
the settlement was reached after
Japan virtually had threatened to bolt
the conference, but he added that
President Wilson seemed to be alone
in considering the threat more than
a "pure bluff."
Say Settlement Meant War
All the American experts on far
eastern affai srat Versailles, Mr. Mil
lard declared, agreed that the settle
ment meant war, He had heard that
a similar view was expressed in the
letter from General Bliss to the presi
dent, which the latter declined to send
to the senate as a matter of public
poncy.
The United States, the witness as
serted, could not. avoid being drawn
into such a war.
Mr. Millard gave it as his personal
view uaseu on iweniy years expe
rience with far eastern politics, taht
Japan never would leave Snatung un
til she was confronted with "a supe
rior force.
- League Pact Joke to Japan
Asked whether he meant a superior
moral force Imposed by the League of
Nations, he replied: "I mean material
force; Japan does not care a snap of
her fingers for moral force." -
During the day the strategic posi
tion of opposing forces In the treaty
ratification fight in the senate showed
no sign of change, but there was an
other outburst during which Senator
Borah, Republican, Idaho, declared
that news of unrest abroad was being
suppressed by British and French
news agencies "while the senate is be
ing whipped to ratify the treaty before
the facts are known."

ASK 1ST LANDS DE CEDED STATES
SALT LAKE CITY, Aug. 19.
Adoption of a resolution requesting
congress to cede public lands to the
states and the formation of an organ
ization to urge this action in Wash
ington, were two important moves
made by the governors of western
tates, who concluded a two-day con
ference on the public domain ques
tion today.
Governor O. A. Larrazolo, of New
Mexico, was elected permanent chair
man of the League of Public Land
States, the name adopted for the new
organization.
Governor Bamberger of Utah was
elected vice-chairman and Edward
Everret Youngt chairman of the sol
dier settlement board of New Mexico,
secretary-treasurer. r
The resolution was presented by
Governor Karrazolo, who has beeni
the head of the movement which re
aulted in the public land' states con
ference and will be the base of u
memorial which will be sent to con
gress. Governor Larrazolo's resolu
tion unanimously adopted at the clos
ing session follows:
"Whereywi government records show
that the public land states contani
225,000,000 or more acres of unreseiv
ed and unappropriated public lands,
and. ,
"Whereas, reservation and exemp
tloii from taxation of such large
bodies of land in the respective states
by the federal government seriously
cripples said states in the efforts to
ward full development of natural re
sources and internal improvement,
and,
"Whereas the public land states are
now facing the most important recon
struction and development era in their
history, and believing that the indi
vidual states can more economically
handle the public lands within their
respective boundaries to greater ad
vantage to the people, we therefore,
"Resolve, that It is the sense of this
convention that congress be urged and
requested to cede all unreserved and
unappropriated public lands, without
mineral or other reservations, to the
states wherein the same are respec
tively located."
Governor Gary presided at the
morning session, while Governor Rob

afternoon meeting until a permanent
organization ' was effected, with Gov
ernor Larrazolo as chairman. Those
attending the conference were:

WASHINGTON, Aug. 18. Secretary
Baker defended today before the sen

his recommendation for an array of
576,000 men. by saying that in view of
the "disturbed conditions in the world"
he did not wish the "responsibility" of

Secretary Baker indicated several
times ,that the bill as presented in

universal- training for 19-year-old
youths, was that of military experts
rather than his own, although it had
his approval. He said that his own I
'guess" was that an army of 576,000
was perhaps somewha tlarger than ne
cessary, but that he did not wish to
take the responsibility of opposing the
country s greaiesHmiitary men.
Regarding the provision for mainte
nance of three divisions in the insular
possessions the secretary admitted
that the force appeared to him Some
what large and agreed to the sugges

York that native troops might be used
to advantage.
The secretary also considered as
worth while a suggestion that part of

I MARFA, Tex., Aug. 18. Aviators H. G. Peterson and Paul H. Davis,
held prisoner by Mexican bandits near Candeleria, Tex., are expected to
reach the horde rtomorrow, it was announced by army officials here tonight.
Couriers sent to the bandit camp last night are reported to have reached
the camp, informing the bandits the $15,000 ransom would be paid.
Other developments today were a report that the aviators were captured
on the American side after making a forced landing, and a statement that
General Manuel Dieguez at Chihuahua City, had ordered General Antonio
Pruneda to leave OJinaga at once with a force of Carranza soldiers in pur
suit of the bandits who captured the Americans.
The report that the aviators landed on the American side came from
Captain Hadley, Fifth cavalry in charge of the border patrol near Pilares,
who said four Mexicans heard the sound of an airplane flying low on the
day the aviators disappeared, and later heard cries for help. This is said to
have occurred near Pervenir, fifteen miles from Pilares. The Mexicans said
they did not Investigate the calls for m?lp.
Colonel Geo. T. Langhorne, district commander here, tonight ordered
an investigation of this report and soliders will be sent to Porvenir to view
the damaged airplane. Officials believe only a few Mexicans were Involved
in the capture.
CONFIDENT U. S. AIRMEN UNHARMED.
Army officers were confident tonight that the two aviators were un
harmed and they believed they would be released tomorrow following the
payment of the $15,000 ransom today.
The aviators carried no side arms when captured. The rendezvous rS
believed to be near the border.
Messages from relatives of the aviators were taken to the bandit camp
yesterday, along with the information the ransom would be paid.
Telegrams to Colonel Langhorne today said Lieut. Davis mother at
Strathmore, Calif., was prostrated. The colonel also was Informed that
Warren B. Davis, father of the aviator, was ready to reimburse the cow
boys, who yesterday raised the $15,000 ransom.
STATEMENT Blf BAKER "HEN SAFE"
WASHINGTON.' Aug. 18. Officials
here tonight, after a day during which
the Mexican situation was to the fore,
awaited news of the release' by- Mexi
can bandits of Lieutenant? Paul H
Davis and Harold G. Peterson, Ameri
can army aviators.
Prompt measures to obtain the re
lease of the aviators who were cap
tured by bandits near Candelaria,
Texas, and for whom $15,000 ransom
has been demanded, were expected by
state department officials following
the forwarding of instructions to the
American embassy at Mexico City to
call upon the Mexican government for
"immediate, adequate action."
Baker Makes Cryptic Remark
Although Secretary Baker spent
most of the day at the capitol before
a senate military affairs sub-committee,
giving his views on the nation's
military policy, there were several
conferences at the war department at
which the situation resulting from the
Indignities upon the American mili
tary officers was understood to have
been discussed.
Returning to the department late to
day. Mr. Baker refused to divulge the
contents of late department dis
patches. He also refused to discuss
the situation beyond saying:
"Aa soon as it is safe to do ao,
I wilt issue a statement."
The secretary remark, made as he
passed out the door of his office on
his way to play tennis, was regarded
in some quarters as significant, es
pecially his emphasis on a statement
being forthcoming only after it was
"safe" to make one.
The attitude displayed by the Mexi
can government toward the request
for immediate action, it was asserted
by some of these, would have much
to do In determining future relations
between Carranza and this govern
ment even though the two aviators
should be released, through payment
today of the demanded ransom.

Toner, and the outfielders could have
chased better after those Bisbee Din

. As it was, the troopers looked about
as strong as Bevo without quite as
much of a kick. Red Toner had 'em
shouting Kamerad from the start,
while the Bisbee crowd made merry
with Johns, their string bean twirler.
The final tally was 9-1 or there
abouts. Toner's twirling was the big noise
of the game. The old coast star a
lowed three hits, as widely scatterea
as present day Jags. He sent ten
soldiers trailing back to the bench oh
strikes.
Umps Earthman denied the Bisbeu
twirler a well earned shut-out in thftj

from second on .a wild pitch. His
umps did a pretty good job of it taken!
altogether, though,, and there were
few kicks.
A human bodkin, named Johns,
Btarted for the visitors. He was a
blood relative of Cy Falkenberg by
appearance and looked good for
about two innings. In the third

a single, sacrifice, three walks and a
hit batsman gave Bisbee two runs,
which was enough to win.

In the next inning they spelled

E. Scott counting four runs.
Bisbee's last run came in the eighth

LUCKY ARIZONA

absorbing topic of the day. Not since the United States
decided to enter the war, have the minds of the people been
centered so unanimously on a Bingle topic as they are on
this question of food and apparel and their sky rocketing prices. Just
why we should be compelled to pay unheard-of prices for meats, eggs,
butter and other products, when there are millions of tons of these
commodities in cold storage, is a question which the learned investi
gators from congress are now trying to determine.
But amidst the criminations and recriminations, the charges and
counter charges of profiteering and of graft, Arizona in general and
the Warren district in particular, can congratulate themselves that
not only might it be worse, but that it actually Is worse some place
else, and in saying this we have the effete east in mind. Travelers
who have returned from the New England states and the Atlantic
seaboard and who have been gouged by real experts at the gouging
; game, breathe a sigh of relief when iiey get back home and find
prices from 25 to 50 per cent lower than "back east."
The West used to.be the habitual victim of the profiteering
easterners, the goat" for unfair freight rates, the hotbed for strikes
and. when not hampered by industrial unrest, crippled by a shortage
of labor. Now the shoe seems to be on the other foot. There are
more strikes to the square mile between Chicago and the Atlantic
coast than in all of Arizona and the cost of food and other commodities
makes prices here look like a bargain sale conducted by Secretary
of War Baker.
While we are working, producing and saving in Arizona' with a
half-way, at least, reasonable proportion between wages and cost ol
living, the east is caught between the upper and nether mill stones
of profiteering and labor unrest. We can only nope that the con
gressional investigators, who appear to be on the right track, will
find a remedy soon for conditions of which the "poor old east" is the
principal victim.
FIRING LINES; PARTY LINES
FOR the first time in twenty-five years a Republican has
been elected to congress from the Eighth Kentucky district.
It is significant, that the victororious candidate is a returneu
soldier". King Swope by name, says the Chicago Tribune.
News dispatches tell of mild astonishment in that Kentucky re
gion, but there will be no astonishment among those who have kept
a finger on the public pulse, noting in the impressions thus received
a renewal of faith in the institutions for which men stake their lives.
Mr. Swope fought for the United States, the nation; not for a
project beyond the ken of his constituents. That for irhich he fought
and for which he stands is readily understood by voters of the Eightn
Kentucky district. His election marks the new trend in politics;
recognition of the fact that the men who went to war can. as a gen
eral thing, be trusted with the best interests of this nation because
they gave the best there was in. them to defend those interests.
Forvoters of this Kentucky district evidently are not being"
led away by any enthusiasm for. untried enterprises, but find their
chief duty in maintaining established institutions, and in doing it by
the election of men porven bjthe acid test of national defense.
Mr. Wilson may have got the idea that the men of the A. E. F.
were dreaming when they fought through shell torn France, but Mr.
Swope is practical evidence of one who was and is wide awake and
thoroughly aware of what it was all about.
PROHIBITION AND PHYCHOLOGY
G' OOD MORNING, have you a little distillery or a kitchen
stove brewery in your home? Government agents, county
deputies and city policemen are finding this question of
more importance since July 1 last than the problem of deal
ing with the desperate, professional bootlegger of the hard-boiled or
twenty-mlnute-egg variety. . The psychologist, lacking other material
for speculation, might with profit look into this rather curious reac-"
tion to prohibitory laws.
The little army of "Statistical Sams", who are always ready to
back up any statement with a convincing array of figures, will tell
you that- drinking at home has increased 213.07 per cent since pro
hibition went into effect and that the number of homes now boasting
a kitchen distillery' or brewery where formerly there was never 60
much as a bottle of almost bee.- will reach into the hundreds of
thousands.
Here in Bisbee another moonshine still has been confiscated, and
it requires no exceptionally keen scent to detect, ever and anon, upon
the evening breeze, the unmistakable odor of old sour mash or the
steamy aroma of hops and yeast. From putting a rasin into a bot
tle of near beer to shipping in grapes by the carload for home wine,
and from sending to Los Angeles for $2.75 worth of brewing material
to moonshining on an extensive scale, every sort of means is being
tried to beat the prohibition laws.
The explanation is, of course, the old, old truth that stolen fruits
are the sweetest. Mrs. Housewife who finds a certain risky relish
in making 60 pints of beer of a rather doubtful quality will soon find
that the resultant product does not pay for the hard work and the
mussy kitchen. A few moonshiners sent to prison will discourage
others, while the steadily decreasing use of liquor will soon reduce
the demand to a minimum. ,
Just now we are like the small boy who, forbidden to do some
thing which he doesn't care much about doing anyway. Immediately
gets the idea that he will nevur be happy until he has done that par
ticular thing. We are exemplifying In a striking way our inborn
hostility to all "Thou Shalt Nols".
THE ACTORS' STRIKE
THE "WALKOUT" of the New York actors by which a num
ber of theatres were abruptly closed, even after audiences
had assembled, is the rather sensational and unique climax to
a long quarrel between the player folk and the managers ol
the theatres. The "strike" is the culmination of an effort ou the part
of the actors for better working conditions and a more equitable con
tract, rather than for higher wages, although that perhaps is in
directly involved. As a sign of the times in a profession supposed to
be devoted wholly to things artistic it reveals how thoroughly the
theatre has been detached from its original moorings and become a
thing of the shop and the bargain counter.
' The injection ef I he moral slsBue into the controversy,, the actors
refusing to work longer on . Sundays, loses even' its . possible value
in the admission thatt objection1 to Sunday work is based wholly on
the question of wages. The whole affair is an unfortunate further
reflection upon the present state of an institution tht has been
maimed and mauled Into insensibility by greed, stupidity and mis
apprehension of its true mission. Whichever side in the present con
troversy may be right and there Is doubtless justice on both sides
the public in the end will be the buflerer.

320 ENGLISH SPARROWS '
ELECTROCUTED IN PARK
DOUGLAS, Aug. 18. Three hun
dred and twenty English sparrows
part of the thousand and more which
roost nightly in the trees of the city
'.park, bit the dust or rather the mud
during the electrical storm last
night. They were picked up dead
this morning at the foot of the trees
by "Dad" Mattingsly," caretaker or
the park. He vouches ' for the num
ber because he counted 'em.
It is believed " the sparrows were
killed by static electricity in the air
during the electrical storm, which
was one of the worat in the history
of the city. One man expressed the
belief that the loud claps of thunder
had scarred the sparrows to death,
as it almost had that effect on him.
Whatever killed them, nobody will
regret their passing.
During the storm it poured raSn for
nearly an hour, from 1 to 2 o'clock,
and the streets ran streams of water.
A bicycle washed down Tenth street
and lodged at G avenue during the
storm. The police hold it awaiting
the owner.
resolution specifies the building cost
at least 575,000.
The city property offered to the le
gion is located at Seventh avenue
and Jefferson street. It has a front
ago of 150 feet on Jefferson street
and 137 feet on Seventh avenue. The
lond is owned by the city, and has
been in use as a rose garden. It was
formerly occupied by a Corral.
DESPERADO SHOOTS ONE
HOfcSE; STEALS ANOTHER
FLAGSTAFF, Aug. 18. Wm. Hick
lin and Wm. Mullen, of the sheriff's
office, started out early Sunday to
round up a desperado who shot one
of John Anderson's horses at Anita,
and then made his getaway on the
other.
Anderson had loaned the team to
his brother-in-law, Nathan Pankhead,
who is running sheep at Anita for a
man named Bly.
About the first of the month Bank
head hired a fellow about 25 years
old, who said his name was L. A. Nor
ton. He doesn't know where the man
came from, and didn't expect him to
stay long, as he had several times
said he was going to leave
But Bankhead didn't anticipate the
manner cf his leaving, which occurred
last Friday. Norton was hitching thfi
team to a scaper. One of the horses,
the youngster, about 9 years old, did
not stand around to suit him, so he
ran into the house and got a rifle
Coming out, he shot and killed the
horse. Then he stripped the harness
from the other horse. Turning the
gun on one of the other men who
happened near, he foraged a saddle,
grabbed his few belongings, and rode
away to the west.
Word of the affair soon reached
this city, and Sunday morning the I
sheriffs office was notiilcd that Nor
ton had been seen at Grand Canyon
by one of Benedict's herders. Hick
lin and Mullen at once set out to get
him.'
RESTAURANT WORKERS AT
GLOBE ASK MORE PAY.
GLOBE. Aug. 17. Restaurant keep
ers in this district were presented
with a new wage scale yesterday
afternoon, said wage scale to go into
effect this morning.
The increased living costs is given
as the reason for the demands as

The new agreement was presented
to the Globe restaurant proprietors
last night, it Is understood that none
of the rfistanrants in the city signed

PHOENIX OFFERS A SITE

PHOENIX. Aug. 18. The question
of a site for the permanent home of
the American Legion of Arizona re
ceived an unexpected offer of settle
ment yesterday by the city commis
sion in the form of an offer by the
city of a quarter block of city proper
ty to the legion. The site in offered
by the city for the state headquarters
building.
The city's offer was all the Impre
remarkable in that it was ' made ofl
the commission's own initiative, no
previous prcposalH of the sort having
been made. In the resolution unani
mously ; adopted by the commission,
the. city offers to donate the -quarter-block

SENATOR ROBERTS
GOOD ROADS BOOSTER.
SAFFORD- Aug. 18. Senator Chas.
M. Roberts, cf Willcox. was a visitor
in town Tuesday and Wednesday,
leaving Wednesday afternoon for
Clifton. '
Senator Roberts' visit here was for
the purpose of conferring with the
board of supervisors tn regard to
proportion of building a good road
to Ejie. Senator Roberts who is
also a member of the board of super
visors of Cochise county, stated that
Cochise county would build the road
frm Bowie to the Graham county line
and that Graham county should com
plete the road to Safford.
The building of a good road through
to Bowie meant the diversion that
way of much travel that goes by the
southern route to phoenix, and as
Senator Roberts says, a good road
from Howie to connect with a high
way in Graham county means more
travelers come this way and good
time made on a good road, makins
better business for Gila valley and
giving Eastern visitors a chance to
travel through the best route to
Phoenix.
Our board of supervisors should
get busy on proposition to build a
good road to Bowie and the board
undoubtedly will.
While here. Senator Roberts was
p guest of Mr. and Mrs. Fred Waugh
tal, at their ranch east of town.

ARIZONA STILL N S OLD
ADJUTANT GENERAL ROW.
PHOENIX. Aug., Aug. 18. Consid
erable speculation has arisen in cap
ital circles as to whether Col. Chas.
W. Harris will again make an effort
to secure the payment by the state
of salary and office claims as adjut
ant general, now that Gov. Thomas
E. Campbell is out of the state.
Harris called at the office . of act
ing Governor Mit Sims yesterday, but
as far as could be learned the mat
ter of claims was not mentioned.
Sims, it will be remembered, on afor
nier occasion, approved Harris' claims
as adjutant general and his assistant,
R. E. McGillen. did likewise during
former absences of the governor.
The existing situation, however, is
slightly different nom that of forme
occasions, with the filing of quo war
ranto proceedings by the attorney
general to decide whether Harris or
CflDt. Walter S. Ingalls. commissioned
adjutant general by the governor on
June 13, was legally entitled to the
office, the clerk of the court sent a
warning to Jesse L. Boyce, state
auditor, not to pay the salary or other
claims of the office until it was de
cided who held the office. ;
Boyce stated yesterday that he had
no desire to go to jail, and that for
this reason he would refrain from
issuing warrant sto either Ingalls or
Harris, regardless of whether Sims
approved Harris' claims or not.

STOCKADE BUILT TO HOUSE
ARIZONA CONVICT LABORERS.
SUPERIOR. Aug. 18. A stockade
is rapidly being completed here for
the purpose of providing suitable
quarters for a large number of con
victs from the state prison at Flor
ence. These men are to be put to
work building the new Superior-Miami
highway, for the construction of
which an appropriation of $100,000
was made by the last legislature.
An appropriation of $60,000 was
made by the legislature at the same
session to provide for the expense of
moving the prisoners to and from the
prison and the road camps. The
state " engineer's department has
adopted the policy that convict labor
will be employed only in counties ad
jacent to the prison, or at least with
in a short distance. This will mean
that convirts will not be used to any
PTtent outside of Pinal. Maricopa,
Gila, Graham and Pima counties.

BY REVIEW
STOCKS AND BONDS
NEW YORK, Aug. 18. Securities
were under severe pressure in today's
very nervous stock, market, some of
the more active issues falling to low
est quotations of the year, while many
others completley offset the material
gains Bcored in the long sustained bull
movement, which culminated two
weeks ago.
From the character of the trading
the decline was obviously assisted to
a substantial extent by heavy offerings
from the shorts, who continued to
press their recent advantage on the
apparent lack of public support.
The reversal was completely mod
erate and held in check during the
first hour, but gathered greater mo
mentum at midday and in the later
dealings .despite the unusual ease of
money, call loans showing no dis
crimination for all industrial collat
eral. Fitful rallies towards the close
lifted the list from the lowest quota
tions, but the recovery in no import
ant case was more than a partial off
set, the session closing with a weak
tone. Sales 1.225,000. Among the
more extreme declines were United
Cigars and American Tobacco, which
dropped 31 and 19 points respectively,
later making up much of their loss.
Rails trailed along at one to almost 4
points, but losses among local utilities
were relatively nominal.
The bond market weakened In sym
pathy with stocks, internationals also
reacting with other investment issues.
Total sales, par value, $13,750,000. Old
U. S. bonds were unchanged on call.
THE GRAIN MARKETS
CHICAGO, Aug. 18. Liquidation
was a constant factor in the corn mar
ket today, receiving impetus through
favorable weather reports and lack of
foreign demand. Corn closed heavy at
3 cents to 4 cents net decline, with
September $1.78 and December at
S1.4401.40. Oats lost to 378c
and provisions $1.10 to $3.40.
Corn prices showed weakness rrom
the stare. Oats fell away with corn.
Provision prices in all deliveries
dropped sharply. Hog prices from 25c
to 50c higher did little to top the
declined in the cured products. .
THE METAL MARKET
NEW YORK, Aug. 18. Lead, firm;

Fined and Sent to
Jail For Threat on
Life of Young Girl
Luis Crus, Mexican miner, who was
arrested Saturday night for threaten
ing the life of Miss Anita Esques un
less she married him, maintained in
Judge Norton's court yesterday that
"possession was nine points of the
law." The court after hearing a num
ber of witnesses held differently and
sentenced Crus to a 15 fine and ten
days in jail. '
The man insisted that he had lived
with Miss Esques as man and wife
for two months in 1917 and produced
two witnesses to corroborate him. The
girl, her mother and brother denied
this, saying that Crus had merely
been boarding with them.
Miss Esques, a decidedly pretty
member of the Mexican colony, told
the court that Crus had been pester
ing her with his attentions and an
noving her by threats. t
The court favored the lady's story
to that of the Mexican trio.

BIG REVIVAL FOR
SILVER IN N. Iil
The present high prices of silver

handling low grade ore Is causing a
wide revival of silver mining through

camps.
He declared that old properties
which have lain dormant since the
early '80s are being rehauled and pui
in shape for examination with a view
to working them again. The Chloride
Flats property on the outskirts of
Silver City was cited as a good ex
ample of this.
Mr. Bragonier said that R. L.
Wright of Silver City, and Joe Star
borpugh, well known to Bisbee min
ers, were planning to re-open and
work a property known as the Bridal
Chamber near Lake Valley, whics
promised well.
Shippers were already working, he
said, around Lake Valley and Kings

Tow: grade ore by the improve,
methods made the revival look profit
