The American artillery last night
completely obliterated a German
position in which 200 gas project
ors had been set up ready for a
gas attack. The projectors were
discovered late yesterday. As soon
as they were definitely located
thre was a great concentration
of American artillery fire and the
projectors and entire position
were destroyed. In the last gas
attack upon American troops only
75 projectors were used. The new
attack, therefore had been planned
on a much more extensive scale.

The Non-partisan League holds for
the building- of sidewalks from end

of city streets in a permanent way
which will obviate floods such as ex
I Tienced in the past and do away
wi:h the enormous unnecessary an

tem has put upon its taxpayers and
will inevitably continue, unless non

The Non-partisan League in thee?
r.-.tters does not intend to imply that
there has been dishonesty in the, con
duct of the affairs of the city, but it
dcis assert that undsr the political
system there is bound to be attend
ance of a manner of upkeep of party
adherents in jobs and on city wort
that does not get the results that busi

ployers get for the money they spend
for non-partisan work.
Tlie Non-partisan League stands for
the development of water in addition
to the ownership of the domestic sup
ply which can be given at low rates
to property owners for the cultivation
cf lawns, trees, ilowers and vegetable
gardens which will help reduce the
cost of living in the city and at the
same time increase the pleasures of
residence.
It s!acd3 for municipal supervision
of prices within the city through a
lir-?nse system, under which those
found to be profiteeiing can be de
barred from business.
It pledges committees to be named
to take up all of these issues and gr?n
crel matters of city expense reduction
an'? facilities increases as soon as its
ticket is elected and to proceed with
as prompt formulation of plans for
their carrying out as may be possible
under wir time conditions.
The Ncn-partlsan League stand.? for
the rigid enforcement of the laws

HIGH SCHOOL NIGHT
GLASSES GROW DAILY;
TEACH ALL SUBJECTS
The night hi?h school classes under
Flynn are proving very popular and
the enrollment in February totaU'd 1C6
students for the afternoon and night
courses. Included in the list of stu
dies taught are Spanish, French, Eng
lish, English for foreigners, bookkeep
ing, shorthand and typewriting, me
chanical drawing, grammar, spelling,
arithmetic and business arithmetic.
In'erest Is particularly keen in the
i Spanish class and in order that those
1 who have never had the advantage of
J study in th's language can get into the
swing of the classes these have been
divided into beginners and advanced
branches. There are now over forty
'I,
members of the two Spanish classes
and by teaching conversation first rap
id advancement is being made by the
students.
French is also proving very popular
and there are about twenty now study
ing this language while the class is
growing steadily. It was started but
a short time ago and it Is expected
that soon it will have nearly as many
enrollments as the Spanish class.
A feature which is greatly appreciat
ed by the soldiers at LoweU is a spe
cial soldiers class taught at '.he camp
two afternoons a week.
By having both afternoon' and even
ing classes the high school makes it
possible for miners and those employ
ed by the mining companies at shift
wcrk to attend each week regularly at
either the afternoon session from 1 to
3:15 or at the evening class from 6:30
to 9. .
Everyone anxious to improve his or
her education Is welcome to Join these
classes.

tain McCrea of the high school basket

students and by local Tans to issua a
challenge id the Y. M. C. A. five lor a

school Tigers and with the Bisbee
high school losing 13 to 8 and the Y.
M. C. A. meeting defeat at the hands
of the Texans by the coimt of .-37 to

between the hilltoppers and the asso
ciation teams would offer an exciting
game while opinion" is evenly divided
as to the outcome of such a clash.
The high school has developed a
strong five under Coach Laurenson
and the students believe that the
yourtper boys will take the measure of
the Y team if a game for the champion
been rroposed that a small admission
be charged with the sum raised going

found none.
The Americans remained for forty
five minutes In the enemy lines. They
found excellent concrete dugouts
which they blew up. and also brought

A Sample of German
Propaganda
While in Los Angeles recently this editor
had occasion to enter a drygoods store to
make a purchase. While waiting for the
clerk to tie up his bundle the proprietor of
the store approached him and engaged him
in conversation on the subject of tVie Great
War. A very slight German accent betray
ed the storekeeper's nationality. His con
versation made it more clear still and show
ed his secret sentiments. Here was a first
hand, close up view of the general and
secret German propaganda all over this
country that seeks to undermine our war
aims and purpojes.
"This war is a terrible thing," began the
Los Angeles storekeeper.
"Yes," admitted the Bisbee editor, but
not in the same tone of honor employed
by the shopkeeper.
"It will go on and on,'' said the shop
keeper, "and come to nothing at the end
but the spending of a lot of money and the
ioss of a lot of live We haven't had a
real taste of war yet ; wait until the casual
ty lists begin to come in next summer. It
looks like we ought to stop before then;
don't you think so?"
The Bisbee man did not, and said so in
words and accent more forcible than polite.
"But the Germans outnumber the allies
on the western front now two to one,"
went cn this propagandist, "and we cannot
get men over there because of the sub
marines."
And then the editor unburdened his mind
to the shopkeeper. The Germans did NOT
outnumber the allies in the west. Ontthe
contrary, the preponderance of men and
metal still remain with the allies on that
front. The Americans CAN get men over
there ; have done so ; a half million of them
at least, and another half million sure to go
before this year has come to an end. The
war ought to go on to a decision, cost what
it may, for none of the principles for which
it is being fought are yet settled, nor has
Germany shown the least inclination to
agree that they shall be settled.
Well, to make a long story short, the
German shopkeeper backed and filled and
seemed to half heartedly agree and finally
changed the subject. But the point of the
story lies in the fact of this concrete case
of propaganda carried on by an alleged
American merchant over his counter with
his customers. We. hear of these things
and pass them over with a shrug of polite
disbelief. But this case came straight home,
and its boldness and purpose were scarce
hidden by subtlety. The man soon came
to the point. We could notwin the war.
It was too costly. Terrible losses were just
ahead. Germany wa3 unbeatable. Why
not stop, like Germany wishes us to do?
These are the keystones of the German
propaganda that arches the allied world in
a mist of spies and shams and bribes and
subterfuge and dishonor and deceit and
desperate and persevering endeavor to un
do by cowardly and disloyal inference what
is being done by courage and patriotism.'
It is a3 vile as it is far-reaching.
But it can easily be made useless and
without effect if only every man and wom
an with a drcp of red blood in their veins
and a speck of thought or information or
logic will only speak right out and cram the
lies and whines and poison inferences back
down the disloyal throat3 from whence
they came. And there would socn come to
be less of it.
Do not hesitate, friends. Thi3 is no time
for politeness and silence and indifference.
Speak out! Every man who knows any
thing knows that the allies have the men
and the material to win this war if they wiii
only fight it out to a finish. Germany
knows it. Hence this propaganda. Do not
let any American coward or German
enemy, no matter what their guise, their
station or their flow of words, talk you out
of this sure and fixed and true belief for
a minute. Rush 'em, and they'll break
ground and back away, for their cause is
bad and their hearts are yellow, through
and through.
With the second army draft of eight
hundred thousand men now Announced to
begin March 29, the national army will
soon number a million and a half of men.
The regular army and enlistments bring the
total cf U. S. troops to be under arms dur
ing the year up to about two million men.
These will all certainly be effective for use
in France early in next year and a third
draft will doubtless be necessary to main
tain this strength. It is expected that the
second draft will be assembled more
smoothly and easily and trained more rapid
ly than the first one. Why not? The
cantonments are fully completed now and
the flow of arms and equipment has reach
ed high stage. More trained officers arc
available. Much valuable experience ' has
been gained by our military boards and
staffs. In fine. Uncle Sam has had a year
of experience and hard "work in war mat
ters and may be expected to make first line
soldiers with much more speed and preci
sion than could possibly have been hoped
for last year when the first draft of nearly
seven hundred thousand men were calied
to the colors. The art of mobilization of
large bodies of fighting men, practiced for
centuries in Europe, was never used in
this republic except during the Civil war.
And the whole world knows that the north
and the south summoned two brave and
splendid armies from the ranks of civil lile. .
That was sixty years ago, but the showing
made in camp by. the new national army is
up to all the traditions of the. Arcerican
fighting man. "Up to the Canadians," is
the European verdict upon U. S. troops now
fighting in the "Golden Toul" sector, and
it is hard to conceive how higher praise
could be bestowed upon these gallant
nephews of Uncle Sam.
In the Tuscon Star cf recent date is a
clear cut article setting forth in terms so
plain that he who runs may read the stand
taken by Senator Mark Smith upon the
Harold Steinfeld exemption case. Sena
tor Smith did NOT seek in any way to aid
this rich Tucson merchant's son to evade
the draft, as had been whispered about hy. a
few people lately in this section of Arizona.
In characteristic fashicn Senator Smith
made his position plain. Patriotic to his
heart's core, he does not hesitate to express
his opinion of those who would dodge their
duty to their country. - It is too bad that all
public officials from the southwest had not
the courage and patriotism that Senator
Smith has shown in this particular case.
The efforts to aid young Steinfeld in his at
tempted evasion of the draft have been ex
haustive, thorough and far reaching. High
heads have helped. Names have been men
tioned in this case in a manner that reflects
little credit upon these men and the offices
they hold. Thp case is of vital importance
in its effect upon the public view of the
draft. The general opinion of southern
Arizona is that Harold Steinfeld ought to
go.
Bisbee has reached a position in wealth,
business and population where her future
progress and attractiveness as a place in
which to live demands that she take a close
interest in city election. Her greatest care
should be the selection of candidates before
election and scrutiny of platforms. With
the right kind of men and the right kind of
platform once in view they will be kept
there until the end. High class men dedi
cated to a platform for better streets," side
walks, civic improvements generally and
city ownership of utilities will mean a great
deal to Bisbee in the coming election. The
desire of our citizens generally to eliminate
politics from the city campaign is a splendid
sign. Naturally it means better govern
ment. Only men who stand for the very
best interests of the city should be 'Consid
ered at all for city office. By a man's rec
ord in the past and his platform, for the
future is he known to his fellow citizens.
Houses ah, there's the rub! The men
in charge of the shipyards on the south At
lantic seaboard say they have solved every
problem but this one. So has the Warren
district.
Speaking of the delays in the shipbuild
ing program Collier's Weekly says: "Strikes
have been called by the 'leaders' who ought
to be in the hands of the department oi
justice for calling them."

According to parties coming from
Douglas yesterday there is a rumor
there that the liquor dealers at Rodeo
may be put out of business in the near
future or forced to move their saloons
if bootlegging continues, was the con
clusion drawn from reports that the
military' authorities are ocmidering a
novel plan to stop the sale of liquor
to soldiers.
Under President Wilson's proclama
tion of May 18. 1917, it is unlawful to
conduct liquor - houses or houses of
prostitution within five miles ot any
army camp. It a troop of cavalrymen
were sent to Rodeo or a point within
live miles of Kodeo, all saloons or
houses ot ill fame would have to close
at once.
What action the military will take
along this line has not been determin
ed. It is known, however, that the
military authorities look with disfa
vor on the continued operations of
bootleggers among the soldiers. Doug
las has been asked to clean up, and
it is practically certain that some way
will be found to strike at the seat of
the trouble.
If the saloons at Rodeo were closed,
most of the bootlegging in this city
and the surrounding country would be
dealt a death blow. If a small detach
ment of soldiers were ordered to with
in the five-mile zone, liquor dealers
would be compelled to close up or
move to some other point. In that
event, the soldiers could move also
and the proposition would resolve it
self into a game of checkers between
the saloon keepers and military men,
with the command "it's your move"
by the latter continually.
