Publishers' Tax Provisions of

Bitterly Opposed in Body
(By Review Leased Wire).
wmm ASHINGTON, Aug. 29. The cli
1AI max of the senate's contest
y ff over the war tax bill was reach
ed today by disposal of pub
lishers' tax provisions and opening of
the long-expected debate on war pro
fits. Outstanding developments today
follow :
Cloture Petition Filed
Petitions for cloture signed by SC
senators to limit debate and force ear
ly passage of the bill was presented
by Senator Simmons in charge of the
bill. A vote on cloture cannot be tak
en under the rules before Friday. In
crease of the bill's levy on war pro
fits, from $562,000,000 to $1,060,000,000
was proposed in amendments by Sen
ator Simmons for a majority of the
finance committee, designed as a com
promise to prevent more radical Inter
ests. The senate made changes in the
bill, which, including the almost doub
led levy on war profits proposed by
the committee, would bring its total
to $2,522,470,000.
Publishers' Tax Eliminated
Provision for a 5 per cent special
income tax on publishers to raise $7,-
500,000 was stricken out without a
roll call.
Modified Zone System
In lieu of the house zone system
for increasing second class postage
rates by $19,000,000 and the finance
committee's substitute proposing a fiat
rate increase of one-quarter of a cent
per pound, estimated to raise $3,000.
000, the senate by a vote of 40 to 35
substituted Senator McKellar's zone
system to raise $12,600,000 additional.
An effort to strike out the section en
tirely and leave present postage rates
unchanged will be made later.
Stone Defends Himself
The senate spent most of the day
debating the publishers' provisions.
Senator Stone, chairman of the for
eign relations committee, vigorously
attacked critics who have charged him
with being a pro-German sympathizer
and defended his attitude on war
measures.
Comprom ises Presented
Upon disposition of the publication
features. Senator Simmons presented
the compromise committee amend
ment on war profits, which include
present taxes, would take $1,286,000,
000 of this year's profits, estimatej
between $3,000,000,000 and $4,000,000,
000. War Profits Up
Tomorrow the war profits bill will
get really under way with a speech
by Senator Underwood In support of
a new substitute by Senator Bankhead
who would substantially increase the
amount of the levy as now1 proposed
by the committee. Pinal disposition
of the bills early next week is Senator
Simmons' aim in intimating cloture.
Cloture to Be Fought
Although cloture would be vigorous
ly contested by the so-called radicals
on war profits taxation the necessary
two-thirds' vote for its adoption is
regarded as sure in the event unani
mous consent is refused. If adopted
the rule would give each nenator but
one hour io discuss the bill and all
amendments.
Senate forces favoring even higher
taxation of war profits are lining up
to support a flat levy of at least
CO per cent.
Bankhead Progresses
The new Bankhead proposals would
levy war profits taxes based upon
capitalization of the following grad
uated rates, after exemption of $5000
and 8 per cent; on profits of 5 per
cent additional, 5 per cent, between
5 and 10 per cent. 10 per cent; be
tween 10 and 15 per cent, 25 per cent;

Secretary of State Points Out
That Germany Made Great
er Promises to the United
States and Failed" to Keep
Them
(By Review Leased Wire).
WASHINGTON, Aug. 29. Any hope
felt here that Argentine would sup
port the allied nations in their war
against Germany virtually has been
abandoned as a result of the German
government's success in satisfying
the demands of the Buenos Aires for
eign office in connection with the sink
ing of the Argentine sailing craft
Torp.
Germany Gives In
Germany's agreement to pay indem
nities and promises not to destroy oth
er ships under (thej Argentine flag
caused Secretary Lansing to point out
today that the imperial government
had made a greater promise to the
United States and then had broken
her word. Examinations of the facts
indicate that Germany will not be eiu
barassed by keeping this latest prom
ise, because Argentina has no mercan
tile marine engaged in trans-Atlantic
trade. The whole controversy has m
pressed some officials here as hollow
and its result is unimportant as a
point scored for Germany. Its only
effect would be to insure the neutral
ity of the South. American countries
whose force is feared.
No Surprise Fett
The outcome has created no great
surprise here. Brazil and few other
South American nations aligned them
selves againts the methods of Ger
many, agents of the kaiser are known
to have been unceasing in their activi
ties in Buenos Aires. Captain von
Papen, former military attache here,
whose withdrawal was requested be
cause of his unneutral acts, now is
at the Argentine capital, where he U
said to be directing his country's pro
paganda. Money to Argentine
It became known today that a large
part of the German money that was in
American banks at the beginning or
America's war wtih Germany has been
transferred to Argentine banks. Some
of this money has been invested there
but most of it is merely held on ac
count May Emoarass Brazil
Argentina's position may prove an
embarassment to Brazil, her neighbor
on the north. Brazil is at war, al
though no declaration of the fact has
been made. Her fleet is patrolling
the south Atlantic in co-operation with
the American fleet and her mercantile
ships are being protected on their
trans-Atlantic voyages in the same
way as are American ships. It is re
garded as possible that the presence
of active German agitation in an ad
joining country might interfere with
her progress.
Much interest is felt here in the
manner in which the people of Argen
tina will regard their government's
attitude.

PHOENIX, Aug. 29. Governor
Campbell tonight wired the Arizona
congressional delegation protesting
against a reduction in the price of cop

giving it as his opinion that the pro
fits on copper should receive the bur
den of the tax. He declared that every
reduction of two cents a pound in the
price of copper means a reduction of
wages of miners of 25 cents a day and
asked that no such burden be placed
upon labor which already feels the
effect of war prices in necessities.

British Admiralty Acknowl
edges That the Submarines
Took Larger Toll Rus-
sians Still Retreat on the
Eastern Front
(By Review Leased Wire.)
LONDON, August 29. An in
crease in the number of British
vessels sunk last week by mines
or submarines is shown by the
weekly admiralty statement is
sued today. Eighteen vessels of
more than 1.600 tons were sent U
the bottom as compared with fi?
teen the previous week and five
less than 1.600 tons as against
three the previous week.- No fish
ing vessels were sunk.
The summary of the statement fol
lows: -Arrivals, 2,629; sailings. 2.680.
"British merchant vessels sunk
by mines or submarines over 1,
600 tons) eighteen; under 1,600
tons, including one previously,
five.
"British fishing vessels sunk,
none."
Russians Bad.
The disaffection in the Russian
army which resulted in the forced
evacuation of the greater part of Ga
licia and Bukowina troops apparently
has not been eradicated although a
stiffening in the Russian defense in
Galicia, Bukowina and Rumania re
cently had indicated that the Russians
were to make no more voluntary ret
tograde movements. Following
Tuesday's report of the falling back
by the Russians in Eastern Bukowina
toward the Bessarabia frontier comes
the news, that, dteloyal to the colors,
the Russians in Southern Moldavia
from Pokshani northward have quit
their trenches and fled in disorder.
The enemy by reason of this defection
has materially bettered his positions
for advance eastward and at last ac
counts was continuing to develope his
success.
Berlin Claims Advances.
The Berlin war office says the Rus
sians have suffered heavily in men
killed or wounded and have lost more
than 1,000 men made prisoners and
three guns and fifty machine-guns.
In addition they have given up
splendid vantage points guarding the
approaches to the Sereth river, the
crossing of which by the enemy would
prove a valuable asset for a Teutonic
advance for Russian territory north
of the bend in the Daunbe.
Kerensky Determined.
Meanwhile M. Kerensky, the Rus
sian premier, has reiterated at the
closing session at Moscow the deter
mination of the provisional govern
ment to protect the results achieved
by the revolution and declared that uo
counter-revolutionary attempts would
be countenanced.
Stormy Weather.
A continuation of' stormy weather is
holding back developments in Flan
ders although the British are still en
gaged in minor trench raiding activi
ties, small positions have been cap
tured and additional prisoners taken.
Verdun Quiet
The fighting on the Verdun front
for the moment also has reached a
pause, only the big guns being active.
There have been artillery duels along
the Aisne front.
Italians Active.
Hard fighting is in progress between
the Italians and Austrians on the Bain
sizza plateau and on the heights
around Gorizia. In the former sec
tor the Austrians are defending tenac
iously a powerfully fortified line to
which the Italians have come with
striking distance. The Italians are
using large numbers of airplanes
which have effectively bombarded
enemy positions. More than 1,000 ad
ditional prisoners and number of ma
chine guns have been taken by the
Italians.
In the south, on the Carso pla
teau, the heavy fighting of last week
has given way to artillery duels and
patrol encounters.

MOSCOW, August 29. At the third

state of utter disorganization of trans

would cease completely by November.
jThe representatives gave warning that
the consequences would be terrible
both at home and on the front and
that the army might turn on the coun

The extreme demands of the rail
way workers, the representatives said,
planed an important part in this dis
organization. General Grousinoff, former military
governor of Moscow, told the dele

Russia from the enemy and that to
this end it was necessary to re-establish
army discipline.
Appeals To All.

"The people of Fargo showed last

There had been no doubt at any Urn-?
as to the general nature of the reply
and the understanding ts that the Uni

as the nation to speak first but some
of the allied foreign offices, accus
tomed l"J long deliberated moves in di

rather expected further discussion ot
the time for dispatching of the replies.
Acted Quickly.
It was realized, however, by the en

that President Wilson must have had
some good and sufficient motive tor
acting tA quickly. Speculation as
cribes the motive to a desire to im
press favorably the great Russian con

It was also suggested that the presi

Comment from the press ot Europe,

awaited with interest Bitter attacks
upon the American note by the Ger

speeches by German officials are ful

is finally allowed to leak through the
censors to the German public. But
for the present at least nj further at

German People Watched.
While the Germans may wage war
with added desperation because ofthe

it is confidently believed bere that
the spirit ot revolt will develop steaj
ily and rapidly among the people in
Germany, bringing nearer the day
when they will assert themselves to
the point where President Wilson may
feel safe in listening to peace over
tures in the construction that they are
from the people themselves and not
from the military despots.
No Dictation Meant
President Wilson realizes the force

Will Divert Food
To Gulf and South
Ports of Atlantic
iDy Review Leased Wire.)
WASHINGTON, Aug. 29. Diversion
to gulf and South Atlantic ports of vir
tually all movement of foodstuffs des
tined for export to Europe, is planned
as a government war measure to re
lieve congestion of freight terminals
and ports in the east. The plans will
be worked out by the shipping board
in cooperation with shippers, ship
owners and port authorities. The ship
ping board will soon name a general
traffic manager who will be put in
charge of the program. It was said
tonight the place pi'jbably would go to
Benjamin L. Winchell of Chicago, now
traffic manager of the Union Pacific
Railroad company. The shipping
board hopes to have the plan working
before snows and bad weather have
made transcontinental freight traffic
still harder to move.
Officials wt'j have given the subject
thought, declare the proposal will add
25 or 35 per cent to the efficiency of
American railways systems and will
do away with the present congestion
of freight in northeastern points.

WASHINGTON, Aug. 29. The ad

surance bill, designed as a substitute
in the future for the present pens'jn
system, was favorably reported today
by a house committee.
Reduce Maximum. j
The principal change made in the
bill by the committee was the reduc
tion of the maximum amount of op
tional insurance a man may take from
10,000 to $5000. Another amendment
adopted prjvides tnat the allowance
of a widow shall automatically cease
upon remarriage. Originally the al-!
lowance would have continued for two
years after the death of the husband, i
Chairman Adamson said the bill '
would be reported tomorrow and p'j i

Allows for Dependents.
The bill would provide allowances:
for dependents of men in the service, '
compensation for death and disability,
bpt.'jnal insurance for officers and en-;
listed men and educational and vex a ;
tional training for honorably discharg
ed men. Administration costs for the '
first and second years of the war are;
estimated at $176,000,000 and $380,000,- j
000 respectively.
Bitter Fight Expected.
The optional insurance section of
the bill, around which the bitterest'
fight will wage, Contemplates the issu
ance to officers and men without dis-
Unction of policies ranging from $1,-.
000 to $5000 for the duration of the
war only, at an estimated cost of $8 ,
a $1000 to the policy-holder. Insurance.
companies recently are said to have
declined to assume such war risks for
less than $58 a $1000.
Proposed Allotments.
Proposed allotments for dependents
of men in the service would range
from $5 a month, according to depend
ents aud their relationship to the man
in the service. A dependent wife with
n'j support would receive $20 a month;
with one child, $25, with two children,
$32.50.
Upon death resulting from injuries

SONORA DEBATING ON
PROHIBITION AND i
MAY DSE OUR LAW
State Congress Writes to the
Douglas Consul for Copy
Arizona Law
The state congress of Sonora, which
has been in session as a constitutional
convention for more than a month and
a half, has not yet reached a determi
nation on the question of whether or
not statewide prohibition would be one ,
nt the clauses included In the basic
iocument. There is a possibility, also,
that the Arizona state laws covering
he liquor question may be adopted.
C. G. Soriano, acting governor of the
state, recently telegraphed Ives G.
Lelevler, consul for Mexico at Doug
las, requesMng him to make a transla
tion of the Arizona law covering the ,
iquor question and forward it to him. ,
Governor Soriano is an ardent advo-l
cate of prohibition, his sentiment hav-'
ing become well known during the re
cent gubernatorial campaign in Sono
ra, as well as being expressed time
and again in conversations and let-'
ters. The evil of alcoholism is the .
first to be attacked, in his opinion, in ;
the effect to elevate the people above '
!eir past and present level.
Mr. Lelevier expresses confidence in
the belief that General P. Elias Cal-1
ies. the governor, who is now on leave
serving as military commander, could '
solve the difficulty at any time and
secure the adoption of the prohibtion
'lause, merely by asking the congress
o do so. ' A large majority of the con
gress were Calles men during the cam
paign and are for his policies. As yet
General Calles has not seen fit to do
'his. !
The congress expects to complete its ,
work on the constitution by or before
September 15. On that date, a nation-:
il holiday, it is the desire of the state j
leaders to have the document ready I
ror ratification.

THE PRESIDENT'S MESSAGE
President Wilson's reply to the peace proposals of
the pope warms the American heart. It Is a smashing
blow at every species of pacifist and traitor under the
sun. It is a clear, strong, determined declaration that
the war against Germany must go to a finish.
Pacifists preach peace, but there is no peace. This
declaration sounds like the voice of Patrick Henry risen
from the tomb. Heretofore President Wilson has spoken
more in the polished and suave accents of Jefferson and
Hamilton, those statesmen and diplomats of our early
days, but now he speaks out in the trumpet peal of that
rugged old patriot who electrified the Virginia assembly
in his immortal speech of "Liberty or Death." We are
out to win this war or perish.
No half way grounds; no backing and filling; no
wavering and wobbling; no stopping this side of a com
plete victory. The president has gone to the bottom
of the diplomatic well and dragged forth the skeleton of
Prussian perfidy. There is no use to treat with these
swashbuckling knaves. It would be a terrible combina
tion of cowardice and folly.
The president has warned all the peoples of all the
allied nations against Wllhelm even as Shakespeare
makes Queen Margaret warn Buckingham against Rich
ard III, the humpbacked king, when she said: "Beware
of yonder dog, for when he fawns he bites, and when he
bites his venom tooth will rankle to the death."
Out of 55 exemption appeals from the draft to the
first draft district board of Arizona only four were
granted. This board is hewing straight to the line of its
duty. Stern but necessary work, like all work connected
with war.
There is a German peace society that has passing
strange fancies regarding peace. It declares against a
peace without indemnity. It declares that the war has
already cost Germany such a great sum that peace with
out indemnity would mean ruin. Therefore, it insists,
while it is strong for peace, that the nations Germany
has assailed and mutilated and ravished and drenched
with blood pay the costs of the war. American pacifist-j
please note.
Estimates based upon the tax commission figures arc
to the effect that the mines will pay 56 per cent of the
taxes of Arizona this year. The increase in the tax as
sessment of the mines was 12 per cent. In other Words
the value of her mines is over half the value of the state'
entire taxable wealth, and they pay more toward the
maintenance of state government than all other indus
tries, utilities and property interests of the state com
bined. The railroads, usually the largest taxpayers of a
state, pay only 13.6 per cent of Arizona taxes, less than
one-third of that paid by the mines. Arizona is an lion-est-to-goodness
mining state.
Special cable dispatches from Rome tell of a new
Italian instrument of war in the shape of an enormous
Coat, carrying the heaviest gung in existence and em
ploying a new type of shell. This monstrosity of the
sea is being used to reduce the defensive works before
Trieste, the Austrian port that is the objective of General
Cadorna's great drive. The newg of this new type ol
naval craft falls upon the ears of the world much as tho
news of the Monitor of the Civil war when that strango
new ironclad engaged the Merrimac in Hampton Roadd
fifty years ago. The Monitor revolutionized naval war
fare. Will the Italian "float" do the same?
"SOAPBOX TREASON"
There is a new brand of treason, discovered and desig
nated by Mayor Mitchell of New York. It is "Soapbox
Treason." Bisbee is more than passing familiar with the
brand. The Wobblies use It for everything from strikes
to arson and murder but never to wash their sins or
dirt away. Writing to a notorious pacifist who had com
plained to his honor that the police "were riding rough
shot over the constitutional rights of American citizens,"
the New York mayor said:
"I have taken the trouble to write you this at length,
not because I am concerned with your opinion but be
cause I desire to have the position of the administration
clearly understood and in order that men who are en
gaged in the despicable work of obstructing our country
and slandering our government in time of war may take
heed.
"This country is at war with Germany. Public de
nunclation of the action of the United States govern
ment in co-operating with otaer governments in fighting
a common enemy is calculated to give aid and comfoit
to the enemy."
After repeating the provisions of the espionage act,
Mr. Mitchell explained the administration's attitude as
follows:
"Whoever wilfully makes false statements, with in
tent to Interfere with the military or naval forces of the
United States, or attempts to cause resistance to the
obligation of citizens to bear arms in the defense of this
country Is guilty under this statute. To urge men
against service which involves co-operation with the
allies of the United States is clearly attempting to ob
struct the recruiting and enlistment service of the United
States."
It will be noted that this pacifist used the words,
"constitutional rights." The term is familiar to Bisbee
citizens, who have been accused loudly and often of
trampling upon the "constitutional rights" of certain L
W. W. traitors who were formerly in our midst and who
seek to return, and seek in vain.
A RED CROSS HYMN.
(By Dr. Harry Reese of Bisbee, in the
Arizona Magazine.)
Come Tl ou Prince ot Peace Eternal,
While our cross with thine entwine;
Lead us forward into batle
On nur mission all sublime.
In thy name we'll conquer hatred.
Give the cup of water cold,
Ease the pain, reclaim the wounded.
Point to the Cross the fleeting soul.
Come Thous Prince of Peace Eternal,
Guard our Nation's righteous cause;
Uphold the good, cast down the wrong,
Grant us just and gracious laws.
So that when the strife is over.
And we've broken the tyrant's chains
Proclaim us Liberty in every Nation,
"Peace on Earth, good will" remains.

ARIZONA UNITES AGAINST I. W. W.
(Phoenix Republican)
Supporting a movement which has gained rapid
headway and assumed' important proportions in the last
several days, numerous telegrams were snt from Ari
zona to Washington yesterday sustaining Governor Stew
art of Montana, who is at the capital as the represen
tative of the governors of five western states for the
purpose of urging the federal authorities to take active
measures to suppress the L W. W.
All who can bring influence to bear upon Washing
ton along this line are urged to join In the messages
which are being forwarded in support of Governor
Stewart. It is realized that he has much of a task in
hand to bring about the conviction in the east which is
so much of a certainty here in the west that the I. W.
W. and other radicals associated with them are a very
great menace to all industry and those furthering the
support of the present movement are desirous that every
possible aid be mustered to its strength.
The governors are asking the federal government to
take steps of such character as will control the radicals
definitely. They say that in order to accomplish this
the use of some federal troops in the different western
districts now being disturbed by the presence and the
efforts of the trouble makers will be essential, federal
troops alone being effective at this advanced stage of Uv;
development of disorders such as the radical anti-government
propagandists have brought about.
The telegrams being sent in support of the move
ment Governor Stewart is directing, are a follow-up on
many telegrams sent from the state in support of reso
lutions adopted at Jerome last Saturday of the same
purport, calling for the federal detention and employ
ment in army work of all I.' W. W. and other radicals
engaged in anti-government propaganda.

When former Secretary of State Root returned to

MEXICAN IS PLACED
IN COUNTY JAIL
.ON MURDER CHARGE
Enrique E. Espinola Is Held to
Answer for Killing of John
McClosky at Courtland
TOMHSTONE. Aug. 29. (Special to
Review) With the lodging in jail to
day of Enrique E. Espinola, a Mexican
of Courtland. it is believed that the
murderer of John McClosky, the aged
rancher of Courtland, last week, na,i
been apprehended.
Espinola was arrested yesterday at!
Dos Cabezas by Constable Eates of i
Courtland, after he had been traced !
fi'jni Courtland. on the day of the cow. I
ardly murder, to Johnson, and other'
camps, and finally to Dos Cabezas. He j
was returned to Courtland where he .
waived preliminary examination be
fore Justice of the Peace O. E. Bolton. 1
Actinir County Attorney Bruce Steph
enson conducting tbe case for the
state.
The evidence obtained against Es
pinola is thought to be conclusive that
he is the man who committud the uiui
der. using his miners' candlestick as a
weapon and inflicting in all eleven
wounds upon his victim, who was
foutid dead just outside of Courtland,
and who had been last seen within
less than ten minutes from the scene
where the crime was committed. ,
According IV) Acting County Attor
ney Stephenson a bloody shirt wa
found in the possession of the Mexican
and he had hobnailed shoes on which
tallied exactly with the footprints
found near the scene of the murder,'
while the candlestick found in the wa
gon of McCjsky has been Identified as
being that of Espinola. Espinola also
is known to not have been seen in
Courtland following the killing, where
prior to that he had been seen there
every day. having lived on the north
side of Courtland, which is a shrt dis
tance from tae scene of the crime.
Mr. Stephenson, who conducted the
examination, is positive that the rig"it
man has been apprehended and to
gether with the sheriffs office Is work
ing on the case to obtain additional ev
idence on which there is a clue.
It is expected the ca.-e will n.t be
tried at this term of court owing to
the brief length of time in which to
prepare the case.
When questioned today Espinola
emphatically deni-d any connection
with the crime and says he has wit
nesses to prove where he was when
tne crime was committed. He says he
is entirely innocent of the crime and
continues this attitude and will go to
trial on these grounds, while the offi
cers believe that there is no doubt bui
what the right man has bn appte-hended.

VY REVIEW
(By Review Leased Wire.)
GRAIN MARKET.
CHICAGO. August 29 Mixed senti
ment among traders was apparent to
day and resulted in an unsettled corn
market, though fluctuations were with
in comparatively narrow limits. Hous
es with eastern connections were
prominent on the selling and word
came from the seaboard of offerings
of Argentine cargoes at lower prices.
Selling on the high points met good
absorbing powers and the finish was
well toward top prices for the day.
The close was 6trong. to cents
higher with December l.OS'4 and May
1.05 to 1.05. Oats gained V to
Cash wheat closed firm. Provisions
made gain of from 22 to 75 cents. ,
Wheat traders eagerly awaited word
of the government fixing prices. The
cash market was firm, but volume of
trading was not large.
Oats trade was not of impressive
quantity, but the market held gen
erally firm. Cash values held steady.
Hog strength and a good demand
were controlling elements which caus
ed provisions prices to advance.
COTTON.
XEW YORK. August 29. The cotton
market today closed barely steady at a
net decline of 10 to 20 points.
NEW YORK FINANCIAL.
NEW YORK. August 29. Rejection
by Washington of the Vatican's peace
plan evidently exerted no especial in
fluence over today's stock market.
Selling was renewed at the outset
and continued during the forenoon on
an enlarged scale. Offerings origin
ated mainly from the bears who suc
ceeded in picking out additional weak
spots, but signs of liquidation were
unmistakable at the period.
No section of the list escaped the
attention of the short interest, al
though rails and a few high grade in
vestment shares yielded only slightly.
The one to three point rallies of af
ternoon resulted in a very substantial
readjustment of losses and not a few
actual gains.
At their lowest levels, war issues
were two to five points down, but
standard industrials offered resistance
to pressure. United States Steel re
peated its recent minimum quotation
of 118 but rallied to 119 and clos
ed at 119, a net gain of a point.
Motors were again weak, Studebak
er establishing a new low record on
Its fall of two points to 444, with a
similar reversal for General Motors.
Shippings and tobbacos rebounded
sharply from their first set back.
Total sales, 575,000 shares., . ,
Another 6lump in rubles to 18.40,
shipment of an additional $500,000
gold to Japan, and created scarcity
of time funds were among the related
Incidents of the day.
Bonds were irregular to heavy with
a wider range for the Liberty issues
at 99 92 to 99.98. Total sales, par val
ue, aggregated $2,625,000.
United States bonds, old issues,
were unchanged on call.
NEW YORK. August 29 The stock
market copiiaues to measure the un
certainty confronting the situation and
the ever changing proposals which are
being advanced in connection with the
matter of price fixing and taxation as
well as the gradual hardening of the
money rates and the unsatisfactory
status of affairs in Russia.
The progress of the Central powers
in Russia would seem to denote that
large supplies of food stuffs and min
eral products are likely to accure to
the Teutonic allies as a result of dis
integration of the Cossack forces
which if realized would undoubtedly
lengthen the war. While of course
rallies in the stock market may be
promoted from time to time as a con
sequence of a temporarily oversold
condition or short covering still the
incentive to take a stand on the con
structive side of things is still lacking
even though present prices of securi
ties in many instances admittedly do
not fully measure actual worth.

IMITATION IN MEXICO.
Complaints are made both by mer

that , American products popular
among foreigners and natives in Mex
ico are being extensively counterfeit
ed through the republic, especially in
the capital. It is charged that coun
terfeits of well known brands of
American tobaccos, breakfast fooQs
End liquors have been thrown on the
market recently in large quantities
and sold at prices which closely par
allel those of the original goods. Pack
ages, labels and "bottles are so closely
imitated that It is difficult to disting
uish the false from the real until the
contents are examined. Some of the
chief offenders are said to be American
firms. ,

these goods .
