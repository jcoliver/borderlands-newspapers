Ever, Says Secretary Fos

Results of the great offensive and
counter-offensive scheduled to usher
in the second week of the steel strike,
by means of which both capital and
labor hoDed to break the deadlock
developed aftef the first few days.
last night remained in doubt. (
In the Pittsburgh and Chicago dis
tricts, the strategic points on the in
dustrial front, both sides made deter
mined efforts to push forward, one
with the hope of resuming full opera
tion, the other of crippling more
nlants. The chief struggle, however
was waged for control in the mills ot
the Bethlehem Steel company, whose
40,000 employes had been commanded
by union leaders to Join the ranks ot
the strikers.
Here are the reports issued from
rival headquarters dealing with the
Eethlehem:
"The employes reported to work
this morning in such numbers as to
provide for practically a full opera
tion of all plants," E. G. Grace, presi
dent ot the Bethlethem company,
paid.
"Charles M. Schwab's big plant at
Bethlehem completely crippled," said
Wm. Z. Foster, secretary of the strik
ers' national committee.
Elsewhere the day's economic bat
tle were equally obscured by conflict
ing claims. The independent plant
ot Jones & Laughlin company In
Pittsburgh is "50 per cent out of ac
tion." according to Foster, but accord
ing to the company officials it 13 little
affected. The Carnegie company and
other concerns in the crucial Pitts
burgh section claimed men were re
turning "in goodly numbers," while
unionists heralded failure of the
United States Steel corporation "to
stampede their forces."
Stubbornly Contested.
From Chicago came reports that
the struggle for control in that center
was being equally stubbornly con
tested, without apparent material
gains for either side.
The Weirton Steel company sus
pended operations at its plants in
Clarksburg. W,. Va., posting notices
that the mills would be closed Indefi
nitely for repairs. This shutdown
was characterized by labor leaders as
a lockout.
PITTSBURGH, Sept. 29. A break
in the rankB of the steel strikers, pre
dieted by some of the corporations
was not in evidence today, according
to reports received from different
sources. No claims were made by
HtPPi companies of large defections
amonfc the strikers, but a. number of
them, including the Carnegie bteei
company and the American Steel and
Wire company, did insist that men
continue to return to work. No fig
ures were given.
Leaders at strike headquarters ex
pressed satisfaction at what they
claimed to be the failure of the United
States Steel corporation to stampede
the organized men. It was given out
by the unionists that more men were

serving on indeterminate sentence
for bigamy.
When he was not engaged on his
plot to invade Canada, Louden oc
cupied himself with promoting a
company to manufacture an "on
sinkable ship he. claimed to hare
invented. He succeeded In interest
ing several financiers in his project,
of whom were William Bernard, the
president of International Salt com

swore out a warrant for his arrest
after he learned that Louden was
trying to , influence ' other financiers
by exhibiting a check for. $10,000 to

confident there would be no further
outbreak of the race rioting which
yesterday and last night resulted fn
the death of two persons, injuries to
several score of others, an attempt
to lynch Mayor Ed. P. Smith and the

In addition to these forces eleven

A heavy downpour of rain tonight

county court house building, where
the county jail was located, shot,
burned, hanged and then dragged
about the city's streets.
At. this time the court house was
burning badly, supposedly of incen
diary origin, and ten members ot the
police department were trapped on
the fourth floor with a -smouldering
hot stairway as the, only avenue of
escape. Several of the policemen
thrust their heads through the win
dows to shout for ladders, but the
only response they got was a rain
of bullets togeTher with such remarks
as "let 'em burn." 'Finally, after se
curing a water hose, the officers,
playing a stream before them as they
went, descended the stairway to the
bottom floor and safety.
Sheriff M. L. Clark,; who had charge
of about 100 prisoners at the county
Jail on an upper floor of the court
house building, tonight told how
he prevented members of the mob
from getting possession of Brown.
"When the heat from the burning

he said. While on top of the build

were shouting for the negro. Other
negro prisoners attempted to throw
Brown from the building but were
overpowered and prevented from do
ing so by the sheriff and his deputies.
Shots were being fired by the mob
in - the street toward the top of the
building where the prisoners were.
Other shots were coming from the
roofs of nearby buildings. Fire was
belching from the air shafts, and a
dense smoke was making it almost
impossible for the men to breathe.
Some of the prisoners were praying;
others cursing. Some of them prayed
that -the officers give up Brown be
cause they believed this would save
them."
Prisoner Coolest.
Brown, reports indicate, was the
coolest man of all the prisoners. '
Finally, after the prisoners - had
been on the roof for about 15 minutes,

absolutely guaranteed to the country.
More than 100 trams are operating in

union men who oppose the strike.

but no anxiety is expressed over this.

"The whole stairway Just below me

sheriff had his back turned to the
prisoners on the stairs above him,

After Brown's delivery to the mob,
the sheriff managed to keep most of
his prsoners on one of the upper
floors of the building until the fire

JUSTICE-REED
. MUSKOGEE, Okla., Sept 29.
"Lacking every element of a court of
Justice, the league of nations would
be a political organization,- pure and
simple," with the "most prejudiced
tribunals ever assembled," Senator
Reed, Democrat, of Missouri, declared
lAjre tonight In the opening address
et six . which he is to make in the
southwest" this week in opposition to
the league.
Declaring that no scheme of inter
national relations ever proposed was
"so certain to bring" world-wide con
flicts" Senator Reed ; asserted it
would be folly to expect abstract jus
tice in any decision ot the league
council or assembly because it
would be impossible to divorce the
self-interest of nations from their
vote in these bodies.
"Animosities, ambitions, wrongs
and oppressions of a thousand years,"
the senator declared, "will enter into
the proceedings of the league and
"control its decisions. Prejudices Of
religion, deep seated and unreason,
ing;race prejudice,, rooted in the
murders of the centuries since the in
vaders from Asia first drove the orig
inal inhabitants from their homes
all these will combine to make im
possible the rendition of impartial
justice."
There Is no great international
question which ultimately must be
decided by the league, Mr. Reed said,
in - which - the progressive nations
would not have an interest sufficient
to control their vote and blind them
to any theoretical larger world inter

PEACE TREATY
Vice President Marshal Con

Legislators Wrangle; ' No
Set Speeches in Order
Hitchcock Gives Up
Hope of Ratification
On Grayson's Explicit Orders
President Will Not Be Told
of Any Action on Pact Un
til Conditio i Has Improved
WASHINGTON. Sept. 29. Not one
passing reference was made In the
long peace treaty debate in the senate
to day to the 30 odd Fall amendments
which Vice President Marshall had
ruled would be the special and con
tinuing order of business.
The discussion embraced almost
every other point. It covered all the
ground from Omaha, Neb., to Persia,
and Vice President Marshall's predic
tion that the senate, once it took up
the amendments, would discuss every
thing else under the sun, was abund
antly fulfilled.
The discussion centered about
speeches by Senator Borah, Republi
can of Idaho, and Senator Williams,
Democrat, of Mississippi, both of
whom digressed to touch upon recent
evidences of mob rule.
There were no other speeches, but
late in the day there was more or
less of a general debate, with half a
dozen senators trying to speak at once
and persisting in their efforts to such
an extent that the vice president rap
ping sharply for order, decraree the
proceedings were degenerating into a
chorus. The Fall amendments intro
duced Tby the Republican senator from
New Mexico and designed to relieve
the United States from representation
on commission created under the
treaty of peace with Germany, must
come up for a vote sooner or later.
There have been promises that a vote
on their adoption or rejection would
be taken this week, but tonight Demo
cratic and Repunblican leaders frank
ly confessed that they had stopped
making predictions. Almost enough
speeches have been scheduled for the
week to take up at least half of the
senate' working time on the treaty.
No Pressing Matter
Senator Hitchcock of Nebraska, In
charge of the administration's f ifrht for
ratification of the treaty with its
league of nations covenant without
reservations or amendments, notified
the White House during the day that
there was no pressing matter to be put
before the president in connection
with the treaty until he had sufficient
ly recovered from the effects of his
speaking tour to tile far west. Senator
Hitchcock all along has expressed the
utmost confidence that the treaty
would be ratified as presented to the
senate, but other Democratic senators
insist that the president should be in
formed that this is Impossible without
some sort of reservation. Just as soon
as Mr. Wilson is sufficiently recovered
from his illness, his friends at the cap
itol believe he will get into the thick
of the fray, with a demand above all
things for speed.
Borah Digresses
When the treay was called up. Sen
ator Borah in a spirited address plead
ed for a return to the old American
ideals, first painting a red picture of
the havoc attempted by anarchist
bands and declaring that with lawless
ness rampant here and elsewnere In
the world it was no time for the Unit-,
ed States to forget the old principles
and link up with every nation In a
league, which he contended would not
assure the peace of the world.
From tho lynching problem the dis
cussion ranged into other fields, and
at adjournment it had reached Persia.
Senator Borah announced he would
continue his remarks tomorrow.

BISBEE PING PPROGHAM IS '
: BEING RUSHED TO COMPLETION
The program of civic improvements
for Bisbee aa outlined by the council
is rapidly bringing the city into the
position is should hold as one of the
centers of prosperity of the state.
Probably the most noticeable devel
opment and the one .of, greatest im
portance to the growth of the city is
.the extensive street ' improvement
program -which is being " carried out
under the direction of P. H. Halleck,
city engineer.
: The paving of half of the lower
Naco road is already completed and
,-will be open to traffic in about ten
days. The concrete surface must be
kept covered with water that much
longer to allow it to set. The com
pletion of the paving of Naco road
presents a difficult problem to the
contractor , on account of the heavy
. traffic whoch goes over it It is now
necessary to haul crushed rock in
heavy trucks over Naco road to Tomb-
stone canyon and it is probable that
-further work on Naco road will be
i 'delayed until the Tombstone road is
.Completed. '
; The Tombstone canyon road Is
Vinveif from the end of the car tracks
fvj tie Ball house. Another day and$
W half, of work will carry the, paving
f to the' city limits.' Rough grading its
now being done from the Warren,
laundry to the end of the car tracks.
The work in Tombstone canyon is
being; seriously delayed and rendered
doubly difficult by the failure of tab
gas company to get its mains in wltH
in the prescribed' time. The gas com
pany was given four months notice of
intention to pave inorder that it might
get its mains installed .nd have the
road clear for the paving contractor
tp begin work. The company has
failed to do this on the Tombstone
canyon road and as a result the con
tractor is forced to put down his pav
ing in patches that are clear, or not at
all.
In this connection it Is-said that
the gas company, in order to go to
the expense of putting in new mains,
has been forced to appeal to the
State Corporation Commission for
permission to issue additional stock.
This, together with the scarcity of
pipe on the market, has made it dif
ficult for the company to get through
with the work in time.
Subway Street Next ,
Subway street will be paved next
week according to present plans. The
grading is finished on this street 'and
the curbing in.
A wall is being put in at the upper
bridge on Naco road to widen the
street at this point.
On Q. K. street, up the hill above
the La More hotel, a flight of concrete
steps Is being put in for the use of
pedestrians. As the street is steep
at this point it is necessary to carry!
all materials up the hill by pack
burros. All of the paring that is being put
in is of the very best and moBt up-to-date
type. It is the same as the
concrete paving between here 'and
Douglas and is the same as the fine
highways of California for which that
state is noted. i : !
i So Eisbee, with as fine .streets as
can be found anywhere; with a traf
fic ordinance based on the' ordinances
of other large cities to keep the traf
fic moving on those streets smooth
ly; with the houses on those streets
all consecutively numbered ( which is
planned for the near future) will take
on a little more of the metropolitan
air to which a center of its commer
cial wealth and importance is entitled.

In response to a letter sent by John

Harvey Tv Woodruff, sporting editor
of the Chicago Tribune, has given
the betting ' odds i. on ' the coming

follows:
"Referring to your recent letter.
most of the small betting here has
been at even money. Ten thousand
dollars was sent up from Cincinnati
at even money j and snapped up at

offered on the Sox at even money,
but they expect to have to give odds

Prisoner on Douglas-to-Bis-DeeTrip;
Hearing. Continus
Pfele and weak from her illness of
the last week following the alleged
mistreatment by Deputy Sheriff Par
mer, while his prisoner. Miss Dorothy
M. Berry, appeared in Judge Winters'
court yesterday afternoon to testify
in the case of the State vs. Parmer,
who is accused of assault on the per
son of Miss Berry.
Miss Berry, dressed in black and
leaning on her attendant's arm, was
assisted to the witness stand and told,
In a voice that was scarcely audible
to the spectators, of the alleged as
sault that Parmer made upon her on
the trip from Douglas to Bisbee. Miss
Miss Berry testified that Parmer had
said, "You would drive any man
crazy, nd I would be only too glad
to pay the money out of my own
pocket so that you can be released.
"He hugged me, pinched my limbs
and subjected me to every indignity
that a girl could be subjected to," he
witness said. "He told the chauffeur
to keep his eyes in front and to watch
the road to avoid running us in the
ditch."
Miss Berry related in detail the
treatment that she claimed une De
ceived from Parmer from the time
he climbed into the back seat two
miles out of ; Douglas until they ar
rived in Bisbee. She testiifed that
Brown, the other deputy sheriff ap
pointed by Sheriff McDonald,, had
told her that Parmer had instructed
him to remain in the same room with
her the night he was appointed as a
guard over her at the Gadsden hotel,
Douglas. - Introduction of Erown's
"Your Douglas guard" note was not
admitted" by the court as evidence.
Parmer when placed on the stand
denied that be had treated Miss Berry
in any way other than a gentleman.
The chauffeur, said to be a brother-in-law
of County Attorney French,
who is ' Investigating the charges
against Brown,' took the stand next.
His testimony was of a non-committal
nature, and his memory apparently
faulty at times.
Roark, the assistant county attor
ney, who', it is alleged, is prosecuting
the Case for the: state, bd no other
witnesses other than Miss' Barry, and
offered no objection to any testimony
that was introduced.
Efforts by the man who appeared
In Parmer's defense to shake Miss
Berry's testimony was of no avail,
despite repeated insinuations as to
her character by Parmer's witnesses
Miss Berry was composed and an
swered in a' straightforward manner
and without hesitation all questions
put to her.

DAY AT STATE FAIR
AMHERST WINS.
AMHERST, Mass., Sept. 29. Am
herst defeated Bowdoin In the open
ing football game today, 3 to 0. Am
herst played most of the game in
Bowdoin territory, but failed to make
touchdowns twice in the first period
when Bowdoin held on the five yard
line. Zink ; kicked a . goal from the
field from the . ten yard line in the
last peariod.
In the interests of American Legion
day at the state fair, Neri Osborn, Jr.,
chairman of the state fair commis
sion for that day, was in Bisbee yes
terday. The fair is to be held at
Phoenix on November 3 to 8, inclu
sive, and Thursday of the fair week
has been turned over to the ex-service
men. It is thought that the gov
ernor will issue a proclamation mak
ing this day one of general welcome
for the returned soldiers.
Former members of the 158th in
fantry will take advantage of this
service day at the fair to form a per
manent organization. All members
of the 158th are urged to attend.
Osborn is touring the state in the
interest of the program for this great
military reunion and of the fair in
general, carrying with him a couple
of reels of film depicting aerial, race
track and cowboy , sports which will
be seen at the fair this year. These
pictures will be shown at the Eagle
theater. 1
A number of' interesting features
are planned. There will be a com
petitive drill between cadet organi
zations of the state university .the
normal schools and the various high
schools of the state. There will be
a military review participated in by
veterans of the Civil, the Spanish
American and the Great wars. There
will be government displays of guii.
and equipment used by Uncle , Sam
in the late war. There wilV also be
competitive gas drills between teams
which were' in this branch of the ser
vice in France. A grand military ball
is planned as the crowning feature
of the occasion.
The committee is hopeful ot having
a large attf ndance on this day of days.
It is going to be the first reunion of
the service men since the signing of
the armistice, and there is a good
time in store for every United States
soldier, sailor or marine who attends.
Incidentally the fair is going to be
bigger and better than ever before
this year. The world famous Lock,
lear has been engaged to put oh his
thrilling stunt of leaping from one
plane to another while in fright. A
total of $49,000 has been hung up for
the winners in the horse racing
events. A $10,000 road race between
El Paso and Phoenix is now being
planned, and an aeroplane race be
tween Los Angeles and Phoenix is as
sured by Burt Barr. The grounds and
buildings have been wonderfully im
proved, and With a new stock judging
grand stand and much better accom
modations for the live stock. This
and every other department will show
more diversified and a greater num
ber of exhibits than any fair in the
past, itis believed.

THE DEVELOPMENT OF A SPINE: j
THERE has never been a general strike which has been success
ful, and there has never been a strike of any importance which
has been successful that did not have the support of the public.
These are two facts to be carefully weighed by the unions which
are now voting on the question of a general strike in support of the
Boston police. A general strike ie a much more serious affair than
people are apt to realize, for the simple reason that very few' peo
ple have seen one in practice. A general siiike is really in the na
ture of a war against society. When furnaces are banked down,
shops closed, and all traffic brought to a standstill, a condition of
things is reached which is no better at all than war, war indeed it
really is, and a public which is threatened with such a 'war should
realize what is means. A strike of this nature was attempted, a few
years before the great war, in Belgium, but it failed to become thor
oughly effective owing to the want of harmony between the Walloons
and the Flemings. A little later a serious effort was made along the
same lines in England, but this too broke down.before it got positive
ly dangerous. Any person, however, who traveled through Belgium
in those days, and saw the countryside quieter than on a Sunday
afternoon, and the towns shorn of all the bustle of commerce, must
have realized the same thing as those who saw the troops bivouack
ing in the London parks, and the stations with their gates closed
like vast empty warehouses, and that was that a general strike, 'even
when only partially successful, was capable .of inflicting enormous
suffering and loss.
Men who have never seen a general strike may vote tolerably,
light-heartedly on the subject. Newspaper readers who have never
experienced one may find the preliminary stages quite intresting,
but thfr real thing when it does come is an experience no one is
likely to desire to see repeated. It is, therefore, little to be won
dered at If, as is reported, Mr. Gompers and his lieutenants are not
particularly pleased with the efforts of those who forced the present
conclusion by attempting to unionize the police forces in Boston. The
great mistake of these organizers wa3 their failure to recognize the
fact that the war, which has undoubtedly played a great part In
democratizing the world, has also roused the "general public" out of
its pie-war supine conditions of the jelly fish, and. endowed it with a
backbone which may eventually prove stronger th'an that of any
labor union. The strike organizers proceeded on the supposition, for
which there was considerable excuse, that they .could go any length
without rousing the public into' resistance. For once, however they
discovered that they were mistaken. They discovered, moreover, that1
the "general public" contained an enormous number of men who
yesterday were soldiers in France, and that these men had learned
something of that disregard of ease and contempt for taking things
"ling down" which had been foreign to the invertebrate jelly fish
of pre-war days.
THE ARMY FOOD SALE FAILURE
THE REPORT that army food stores have fallen, into the hands
of large dealers and that consumers who thought to profit by
the sale have net received the supplies they ordered, is no more
than could have been expected. Some effort was made when
the sale was announced to bar out the large dealers and big whole
salers, but nothing more was beard of it, and goods designed to re
lieve the high cost of living simply go into cold storage or ware
houses to help boost prices when the moment is favorable. The
government, it seems, simply does not know how to transact busi
ness. Army stores are now to be opened, bnt there' is nothing to
show that a repetition ot the postoffice sale can be presented. The
whole deal is rather discouraging. But then, there never was much,
chance that the army sa;e would succeed in affecting living prices
to any extent. The supplies were not large enough for oti3 thing,
anJ for another the government was not cute enough to divert them
to the small consumer. At the veiy moment, almost, when the fail
ure of the army sale is revealed the department of justice announces
that living prices have declined as much as 10 to 15 per cent in some
cases. If that is true, the army sale had nothing to do with it. The
plain failure of that sale rather discounts, by the way, reports of
falling prices.
The truth appears to be that a world-wide condition is con
' fronted. Production is not equal to demand. Until it is bin prices
may be expected. Agitation and outcries and the arrest of a profiteer
here and there may have some effect, but they do not reach the
root of the problem, and they will bring no permanent benefit. At
torney General Palmer thinks the reinforcement by more legislation
of the war-time food control law may bring the desired benefits, but
even that is doubtful. President Wilson thinks that ratification of
the peace treaty by the Senate will operate to cure most of our ills,
reopen plants closed by strikes and sped up business and production
and bring down prices. That is a far-fetched view. We must go
deeper, and we shall find no solution until we can find a way to
resolve industrial unrest.

Sept. 29. Up betimes, after a good sleep. Methings the sleep was so
eound because I had spent Sunday in Douglas, which is a city as conducive
of snores as Philadelphia. Much disappointed in it, as there are many towns
just like it, and the restaurants are bad. Glad to be back in Bisbee. Did
meet some girls also in Douglas, but they were sleepy, too, so my day was
ill spent. Many rumors today of good boxing matches coming, which made
me feel good, and I am i:reu to watching Charlie Chaplin. Did see an old
friend from Leadville, who told me much gossip. To the postoffice, where
I did get a letter from my wife. As usual, she asked me for money. Believe
I will send her some, but I pray God she is careful of it. To the Y, where
I played billiards. Much disturbed at finding my skiyi leaving me at first,
but I did recover and gave my opponent a sound drubbing, which did give me
niuch delight, especially since he did have to pay for the game. To the of
fice, where I found that the Bisbee baseball team had beat Willcox. Sorry
I did not bet on the game. Worked hard at the office, as tomorrow is pay
day, which thought keeps me in good spirits. Thence to bed. where I did
dream that my wife had asked for more money, whereat I did wake in a
panic, but fiading it. all imagination, to sleep again with a good heart.

FIRST PUBLIC HE
IN STATE ASSIGNED TD WARREN
The organization of a division of
public health nursing by the United
- States public health service is a rec
ognition of the public health nurse as
an essential to a good health admin
istration, and Bisbee and the Warren
district are the first in the state to
have a nurse working solely and dis
tinctly cn public health problems.
The recently issued report of the
Arizona Antt-Tuberculosia associa
tion gives the Warren district that
distinction, although several commu
nities have combination community
and school nurses, and nurses work
ing upon school work alone are to be
found in practically every large
school district in the state.
Miss Amy Potts, the Red Cross
public health nurse for the Warren
district has opened offices in John
ston's addition and is now spending
her time getting acquainted with the
needs of that locality, preparatory to
j the inauguration of a health program
' There are certain branches of
health work which public health
I nurses are especially qualified to do
by virtue of their experience and
j training, and which they do better
( than physicians and sanitary inspec-
tors. It was this fact that led the
government to consider them as aD
essential to a modern health admin
istration. Public health nursing, like all other
nursing, is not a work by itself, but
a very necessary complement to the
work cf others. The success of the
work of a public health nurse is quite
dependent upon the support and co
operation of the physicians and health
officials. ;
The successful public health nurse
reaches so many different groups of
people that her opportunities for
helpfulness are very great. She comes
in touch with women's clubs and
other private organizations, with
boards of health and boards of edu

However, the best and most useful
of the opportunities of the nurse is
her welcome into the homes of the
people, and the honored badge of the
Red Cross under which she works
makes her more acceptable. The wel
come is gained through her services
in time of sickness and through her
interest in and care of the children
of the family. This tangible service
is understood and interpreted in
terms of friendliness, so that advice
in health matters is graciously taken.
In the control of communicable dis
ease, the public health nurse, who
will go to each home, show the moth
er just how to care for the patient,
how to disinfect all clothing and how
to protect herself and the family and
neighbors from infection, which will
be far more effective than hundreds
of printed circulars or dozens of in
spectors who tell the pioeautions but
do not actually demonstrate them
with their own hands.
The work of Miss Potts in the
Warren district has wonderful possi
bilities, particularly as it comes in
the only field of health education and
demonstration that has been more or
less uncovered.

GET THIRST!
HONOLULU, T. H.. Sept. 29 (Cor
respondence of The Associated
Press.) That an embargo on the ex
portation of rice, recently imposed
by the Japanese government, will
cause such an exodus of Japanese
from Hawaii, if it remains- in effect.
as to create a serious shortage of
plantation labor, is the claim made
editorially by the Nippu Jiji, a Japan
ese daily published in Honolulu.
The Nippu Jiji concludes that the
embargo on Japanese rice, coupled
with prohibition in Hawaii, will cause
many laborers to return to the home
land, as in Hawaii "no joy in life can
be found because sake (a Japanese
liquor) and rice meals are unobtaln
able."
Hawaiian and California rice is de
clared by the Nippu Jiji to be greatly
Inferior to the Japanese product. .
The editorial continues: "It Is a
fact that the exodus of Japanese la
borers from Hawaii has greatly in
creased since the territory went dry
last year."

BIG SERIES
CHICAGO, Sept. 29. Manager
"Kid" Gleason and 23 members of the
Chicago White Sox. American league
pennant winners.' left here tonight for,
CincinnatlM where they will meet the
Cincinnati Reds Wednesday and
Thursday in the first two games of
the world series.
Every man on the team whs de
clared to be fit for the championship
games, and each expressed himself
as confident that the Sox would come
back to Chicago with a lead over the
National league rivals. Manager
Gleason has given his -team a com
plete rest since they clinched the pen
nant several days ago. In the final
three games of the season, each, of
which ' resulted in a defeat for the
Chics goans, the lineup was made up
mostly of substitutes and the Regu
lars played such indifferent ball that
they were booed and hissed by many
of the fans at yesterday's game.
A stiff practice had been planned
for today, but the heavy rain of last
night put the Comiskey park in such
shape that it was thought best to call
off the practice and let the ground
crew work on the park getting . it
ready for the first game here Friday.
Gleason and his players held a con
ference this afrnoon, however, mak
ing their final plans for their inva
sion of National league territory.
Tomorrow the team expects to take
a stiff workout in Cincinnati. Gleason
, said Cicotte and Williams will work
the first two games.

choked down and falling into the

their fights here, when each of i'h

definite announcements will be forth

with the Mexican state officials hate
also been opened with wire, and as

What Is It AH About?
When war and the draft taught as
that American manhood was but 66
ier cent efficient, we woke from our
long cherished national pipe dream
of physical superiority. In the par
lance of the day. "we learned a few
things that made us sit up and take

plenty of "sand." Their hearts were
in the right place most of 'era but
they didn't beat the right way. So
our medics patched them up where
they could, and they were sent to
camp. They drilled, they dug ditches,
the gilded youths peeled potatoes,
the bank clerks learned to cook, and
erstwhile knights of the road and of
the street corners were taught clean
liness and industry. They all learn
ed to keep step ana to shoot straight:
they ate beans and hard tack, ana
the rookies that went into the hopper
came out MEN men that turned the
tide of war and materially affected
certain formalities recently con
cluded in Paris. '
The government realized that In
order to release its men for war,
; women must be found to take their
places. They came at the natiou
' wide call sent out. But it was not
long before long hours, crowded
quarters and the nervous tension of
rush work began to tell on physiques
which, like those of the men, had
. bean jararertlmatsd.

the. Qu.gj'lrt
Then, as a "war measure," the war
department set about patching up,
as best it might, this part of its
war machine. Susanna Cocroft, na
tionally known for her work to better
the health of women, was ordered to
report for duty. She came, she saw,
she prescribed: "regular physical
exercise in the open air." They took
it in daily doses, as directed, on the
White House lot.
The armistice was signed and most
of the women went home. Then said
a thinker: "If it is necessary in war
to care for our women workers, why
is it not worth-while in peace to see
that the women of America the
mothers of the race are strong, ef
ficient, healthy, happy?"
U. S. Training Corps for Women.
And so the United States Training
Corps for Women was organized,
with the approval, co-operation ana
support oi national military and
health officials. The camp at Lake
Geneva was the first; it was con
ducted ad an experiment just t
Kive the authorities conclusive proof
of the possibilities.
The "age limit" is from twenty
years up. There are grandmothers
here, a mother of ten children, and
a crowd of young beauties that would
tempt the most law-abiding im
presario or musical comedy producer
to kidnapping.
They come from twenty-two states
in the Union. They are home-makers,
professional women, teachers,
society buds and blossoms, clerks,
students, industrial workers a per
fect democracy with a big "D."
Discipline of Regular Hours.
The discipline of regular hours,
regulated exercise, wholesome food
and new ideas in turning tho tired,
lagging gait into a military quick
step, and the fagged brain into an
effective high-powered machine.
Powder puffs and lip sticks have be
come non-essentials
And fun? Just ask 'cm! Petween
mess and taps comes enough fun to
make any woman know she is not old
at sixty. The "tents" take turns in
entertaining the battalion. With no
scenery but the wood and the water,
no costumes but their khaki uni
ties neglected. Men and wonieu na
tionally recognir.cd as authorities ir.

"Personal Care": "Home Care of the

STOCKS AND BONDS
NEW YORK, Sept. 29. Steel shares '
were again the pivotal featuer of to- I
day's very active stock market, evinc-
ing erratic tendencies in the early ,
dealings, but rising vigorously later. 1
when advices from industrial centers
were more encouraging. I
Equipments reflected the uncertain
trand of steels for a-tihe, but improved
mitPiiallv later, motors aiso nsuis.wuu
moderately, with oils. I
Variable strength was displayed by
food shares, especially sugars, with
substantial gains in leathers, rubbers,
tobacco and paper issues and rails
strengthened on revival of speclative
interest, in several of the low grade
stocks, transcontinental also coming
forward.
Highest quotations were reached in
the final hour when uruciDie ateei
showed at extreme advance of 22
Doints at the new high record of 237
while United States steel rallied from
its low of $104 to $07, closint un-
changed a point under its top price.
Bethlehem "B" added 3 points to
last Saturday's gains of 7 pointa.
Sales 1,375,000 shares.
Foreign exchange was unsettled by
the heaviness of bills in London, ca-
bles from there indicating uneasiness
in financial circles because - of the
Britsh railway strike.
Liberty bondseased, after showing
moderate strength and the general
bond division, including rails, was ir-
regular. Total sales, par value, $12, -
875,000. Old United States bonds were
unchanged on call. .
THE GRAIN MARKETS
CHICAGO, Sept. 29 New declines
in the value of corn took place today
owing more or less to a fresh drop in
foreign exchange rates and to notice
that a result of the British railway.
strike all Bailings to the United King
dom had bene suspended. The market
closed unsettled, Vic to lMc net lower
with December $1.24 to $1.24 and
May $1.22 to $1.22. Oats finished
unchanged to lc down and provi
sions varying . from 80c decline to a
rise of 70c.
Lack of suppqrt was evident from
the outset in the corn market, with
weakness cf foreign exchange as tem
porarily the mainbearish factor, sup
plemented by lower quotations on
hogo. It was not, however, until hold
ing up of vessels in United States
ports was announced that selling pres-
surse became pronounced. A large
amount of grain for the United King
dom was saidto be waitlngat seaboard
anu with new loading of vessls prohib
ited, misgiving were expressed that in
terior congestion might ensue. Under
such circumstances, bulls remained at
a disadvantage throughout the session.
Oats sympathized with corn weak
ness notwithstanding a decrease in the
oats visible supply total.

With the discovery and seizure Sun
day of a still. and all the necessary

with Dominic Cotero, possessor, of a
notorious Ted notebook And another
of the chief witnesses in the deporta

viction here oma charge of .-beating
a; woman, and Robles.. is in Jail, serv
ing, a sentence for . an . attempt ; to

Announcement was i made yester

ing the proposed juvenile home for
the f semi-delinquent . children of,i Co
chise county will be made today,
when the final meeting of the com
mittee in charge will be held. "This
committee, .appointed by the'- War
ren District - Commercial club to as
sist the original location - committee,
consisting of A C. Lockwoodi judge
of the , superior court;' I. CE. Ad
ams, chairman of the board of coun
ty supervisors, and James McDon
ald, sheriff, is composed of C. W.
Allen, C. F. Phllbrook. Frank Bled

Accompanied ' by Adams, the com
mittee - has - examined two sites at
Warren and one at the Charles
Thomas ranch, over the divide, and
one, of these three sites will be
proposed to the state.
The home for semi-delinquent chil
dren has been made obligatory for
every county of Arizona by the state
law, which also carries an appro
priation of 160,000 for the necessary
buildings and Improvements. Until
the activities of the local committees
.were made public, it ' was believed
that Douglas was making the only
definite attempt in the county to se
cure the appropriation, but It is now
thought that Bisbee will make even
a stronger bid tor it.
