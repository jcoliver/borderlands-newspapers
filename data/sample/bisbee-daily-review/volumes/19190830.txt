PHOENIX, Ariz., Aug. 29. The
reclamation service is to go ahead
immediately with the sale and Im
provement of the Yuma msa project,
according to an announcement made
here today by State Senator Mulford
Windsor of Yuma, who, has recently
returned from a six weeks' stay in
Washington in the interest of this
project.
"Secretary Franklin K. Lane, sign
ed the order to go ahead with the pro
ject while I was in Washington,"
said Senator Windsor, "and the first
sale has been set for December 10.
The land has been sub-divided, and
will be sold by means of sealed bids
for the land and the water right, to
be opened on that date. The law un
der which this will be done was pass
d in 1917, but Its operation had
been held up by the war. Now we
will go ahead.
"The land to be sold has been di
vided into tracts of from one to 20
acres. In my opinion it will sell for
about $250 an 'acre.
"The irrigation is to be done from
canals to which the water will be
lifted from the main Yuma canal by
pumping plants, operated by the gov
ernment on its own power."

NEW BORDER COMMANDER, FROM

FROM CHANGED MEXICAN POLICY
EL' PASO, Tex., Aug. 29. "It seems reasonable to expect that our
neighbor Mexicans should respect us and, as the world war is over and
practically all of our combat divisions are at home again, those in
authority, if they see fit, are well able to adopt and carry out a policy
that should bring about favorable and happy results," Major General
Howze, who arrived here late today to assume command of the border,
announced in a written statement given the Associated Press
"This policy should bring about favorable results as far as concerns
first our own interests and those of our friends, subjects of Great Britain
and France, who have vast property holdings in Mexico; and, as far as
concerns Mexico in stabilizing or in establishing a livable form of gov
ernment," General Howze added.
"We are living in a time too far advanced for the world to tolerate
any but livable forms of government wherever civilized people may
choose to live.
"Fortunately, American military matters on the border are In the
very best hands, those of General Joseph T. Dickman, at San Antonio,
who in turn is backed up by our strong chief of staff, General March."
General Howze came direct from New York, arriving there Sunday
from the occupied area of Germany, where he commanded the Third
division on the Rhine. He was formerly in command of this district be
fore going overseas. He relieved Brigadier General James B. Irwin,
who returns to his pre-war rank of colonel, September 1.

Douglas. Ariz.. Aue. 29. Cnntlmi.t.
tion this afternoon of the joint pre
liminary hearing in the deportation
cases brought out no testimony of a
sensational nature, but something in
teresting regarding the I. W. W. strike
that preceded the deportations in July,
1917. A divergence of opinion was
again shown concerning the Btrike by
witnesses for the state, one wiinenc
approving it, another declaring he had
been against it and ft Mirrd being half
way in favor and half way against it.
None of the witnesses, however, from
their testimony, appeared to have per
sonally investigated the conditions
that led up to the Wobbly strike or
might have resulted from it had the
strike been successful.
Canada Sparks, who was arrested
on the day of the fienortations, but
released before the deportee's were
loaded on the train that carried them
to Columbus, N. M".. said that althoueh
he had been worHnc In the mines for
several months previous to the strike

it. did not know who had presented
the "miners" demands and did not
know what organizations, if any, had
declared the strike.

go out on Btrike. but. Just quit work
wnen the I. w. W. called a strike. As

he never learned who was calling it,
although he himself was a miner.
On the morning or the day of the
deportations, said the witness, he was

Swetish was strong for the strike.
He knew the I. W. W. had called it,
he said and declfired that he thought
the demands were all right. Ques
tioned as to what the demands were,
Swetish could name but two of them!
He was interested more in the strike
than in the demands that caused it,
he said, and as long (as there was a
strike of some kind on, said the wit
ness, he was anxious to see it won
regardless of what demands were
made.
Clark a Seductive Speaker.
Swetish said he had heard a speech
made by Stanley Clark, one of the
former I. W. W. leaders In Bisbee,
and had approved of it. Asked what
Clark had said, Swetish replied that
he was nather hard of hearfnr had

Alfred P. Hendricks, who was on
the witness stand yesterday when
court was adjourned, completed his
cross-examination at the opening of

PRICES; PUBLIC
STILL HELD IIP
CHICAGO. Aug. 29. Although
live hogs have declined slightly
better than $3 a hundred pounds
in three days and dressed beef
was down $2 (a 100 pounds in the
wholesale markets today, with
general bearish sentiment pre
vailing, consumers in Chicago to
day had gained no apparent bene
fit. The retail price of beef, pork
and mutton continued high,
though mutton was down vith
beef and pork in the wholesale
markets. The drop in live heg
prices at the stockyards today
was about 50 cents below yester
day's general average.
"Wholesale beef prices have
shown almost steady decline for
almost four months," according
to a statement from H. D. Swift,
vice president of Swift and com
pany, today. "Our company's
average wholesale price of beef
sold in Chicago the week ending
May 31, at 20.91. The week end
ing August 16, it was $17.54. as
aglainst $16.63 for the week end
ing September 1.
"Muttons and lambs at wholo
sale prices also are off consider
ably, there having been a drop
of about 11.20 a hundred pounds
in the last week and these lower
ed prices are also, no doubt,
being reflected to thi confunie'

De la Huerta, On His Way to
Become Governor of Sonora,
Says Foreign Oil Interests
Will Be "Met Half Way"
EL PASO, Texas, Aug. 28 "The
Mexican senate wishes to meet the
foreign oil interests half way, said
Senator Adolfo De La Huerta, governor-elect
of Sonora, here tonight while
enroute to Hermosillo, Sonora, to be
come civil governor September 1.' He
was Mexican consul general in New
York before his election to the senate.
Senator De La Huerta said there
was a general teeling in the Mexican
senate that certain clauses in the con
stitution applying: to the oil situation
should be eliminated and that the
idea of the senators was to hurry up
action on these objectionaDle polnu
in order to eliminate the possibility
of international friction.
The general idea of the senate, as
I understand it, is to modify the pe
troleum law so as to eliminate those
points to which the foreign oil com
panies most object," he said. "The
senate. I believe, wishes to meet the
oil companies half way. President
Carranze plans to deliver his message
to congress September 1, but I did
net learn before I left Mexico City
what his position would be in refer
ence to the oil situation.
Senor De La Huerta said the labor
ine men of Mexico are trying to bring
about better understanding between
the united States ana Mexico larousu
the Mexican and American labor un
ions. He said Luis Morones, Jose F.
Gutierrez and other labor leaders were
making efforts to interest Samuel
Gompers, president of the American
Federation of Labor, and other Ameri
can labor leaders in their efforts and
thus bring about a tuose co-operation
between the organized labor of the
two countries.
" "The feeling toward Americans in
Mexico City is unchanged since the
American punitive expedition crossed
to Mexico" he said. "However, this
expedition was considered a mistake
because such expeditions cause fric
tion at a time when everyone who
has the interest of the two countries
sincerely at heart is trying to avoid
just such friction."
He said there was no possibility of
Carranze becoming a candidate for
the presidency in 920 and said Gen
eral Obregon and General Gonzalez
were considered the strongest candi
dates at present. Senator De La
Huerta declined to make a statement
as to lis plans as governor of Sonora.
He said he wished to consult with
newly elected representatives to con
gress and other Sonora officials be
fore he made any statement regard
ing the prohibition law, the applica
tion of the agrarian law, to which
American interests in Sonora have ab
jected, and the order of former Gov
ernor Calles fixing the death penalty
for "bootlegging."

MJlv Housewives Busy Pickling
By Biddy Bye.
In these latter days ot August every
housewife is prone to wish SHE bad
a husband as accommodating as Peter
Piper who thoughtfully picked pep
pers already pickled.
There is a tremendous demand for
vinegar and sugar and species, and
tumeric and cucumbers and small
onions and other delicacies whicff
suggest that the pickling season is
open. It is. And here are many
tried and tested recipes for manipul
ating pickle ingredients with great
success.
Plain Cucumber Pickles.
Select small, firm cucumbers, wash
them well, and lay them in a large
stone jar.
For every eight quarts of cucum
bers make it brine of 1 gallon of boil
ing water poured over 1 pint of salt.
Bring to a boil, skim, and pour over
the cucumbers. Let stand six hours.
Drain the brine from the pickles, boil
again, and again pour over the pick
les and let stand over night. Repeat
the draining, boiling and rebrining
of the pickles next morning and let
stand six hours. Next add 1 table
spoonful of alum to 1 gallon of boil
ing water and pour over cucumbers
which have been freed from the brine.
water and pour over again. Next
morning drain off alum water. Heat
1 gallon ot vinegar with 4 whole red
peppers, 4 sticks of cinamon, and 1-2
tablespoonful of allspice, and same
amount of whole cloves. Bring slowi
ly to a boil. In another kettle heat
quart of vinegar. Mix all the ingredi
drop in a dozen cucumbers and "boil
8 minutes. Remove to stone jar, and
repeat until all pickles are cooked.
When finished cover the pickles
with the spiced vinegar, cover close
ly, and store in a cool, dark place.
Uncooked Mixed Pickles.
Pare and chop fine 3 quarts of ripe
tomatoes, 1-2 pint of grated horserad
ish, 1 pint of fine-chopped celery, 12
cupful of chopped onion, 8 tablespoon
fuls of chopped red pepper, 8 table
spoonfuls of sugar, 8 of salt, and 1
tablespoonful of ground cinnamon.
Add 1 level teaspoonful each of
ground clove and mace, and one
quart f vinegar. Mix all the ingredi
ents thoroughly and pack the pickle
in a stone jar. Ready for use after
a week and keeps well all winter.
Let stand six hours, then boil the
Pickled Onions.
Select 10 small white button
onions and remove the outer skin
with a silver knife. Pack the onions
in stelilized pint jars. Pour over
them a strong brine and let stand 24
hours. Next pour off the brine, add
a fresh brine and let stand another
24 hours. Next day make a strong
fresh brine and boil the onion3 in it
for five minutes. Drain and let
stand in fresh, cold water for three
hours. Drain and pack tightly In
jars interspersing with white pepper
corns. Cover with a hot liquor made
of vinegar, allowing to each pint of
vinegar 1 tablespoonful of all spice,
1 tablespoonful of black pepper and
1 red pepper pod, 1 dozen pepper
corns, 1 dozen whole cloves and 4

ENDING THE RAILROAD STRIKE
HE country in general and the railroad brotherhoods in parti-
Tcular are to be congratulated on the approaching end of the
coast rail strike. With the brotherhood leaders ordering the
men back to work and the men refusing on the ground that
they were in danger of mob violence, it looked for a time as if the
railway unions were losing control of themselves.
The belated action of the administration in threatening to put
soldiers on the roads this morning unless transportation was re
sumed was not, we believe, responsible for the failure! of the
strike. Wiser counsel among the union leaders prevailed at last and
the brotherhoods saved themselves in the nick of time from being
utterly discredited, if not destroyed.
While the country is going through the throes of adjusting it
self to peace time conditions after being on a war basis for over two
years culy a Lenine or a Trotzky would countenance or advocate
a strike on the railroads, which are the arteries Of the nation. The
times are too critical, conditions too chaptic, for any man or any set
of mii to attempt to block the channels of the country's commerce.
Had the unions persisted in extending a strike that was a purely
Los Angeles affair, public opinion of thee ntire Nation would have
risen up against them.
It is a gratifying fact to find that the unions are still in the
hands of men who can see the light and that these men, on whom
the most tremendous of responsibilities rests, are not afraid to act
when the time for action comes. There must be a breathing space,
a chance for readjustment, before the workers on whom the nation's
chief iiiaustries are dependent resort to the strike. The leaders or
the brotherhoods recognized this patent fact and acted accordingly.
Jt is true that there is impatience and bitterness in all ranks at
the riling cost of all necessities and the failure of wages to Keep uj
with lije rapid advance in the cost of living. As a matter of fact, it
is the salaried man in the offices and stores who is hardest hit by
this discrepancy. The disclosures of profiteering have aroused jus
tified resentment among the workers. A belated investigation prom
ises some time, some day, to settle this profiteering and cost of living
problem.
But to attempt a strike on the railroads at this time would be
nothirg short of Bolshevism. The government has taken over the
roads and failed in its efforts to operate them on a paying or efficient
basis. This problem, too, must be solved. A strike would only
climax confusion with chaos.
Perhaps the situation in the city of Los Angeles was responsible
for tho apparent bitterness manifested from the first day of the strike.
Los Angeles has always bragged of being an "open shop" town. As
a matter of fact, there is no city in the country where such a war
to the knife is in constant progress between the unions and the em
ployer as in the "city of the angels." This may explain why a local
difference involving the employes on the electric lines flamed' iip t-
such menacing proportions.
A cause for congratulation here is the fact that duriift the criti
cal two weeks there was never a hint of a strike locally. Bisbee
and, in fact, all of Arizona east of Tucson and Phoenix, escaped the
sparks from the firebrands on the coast.
The whole country will breathe a sigh of relief that the crisis
has been averted, at least for the present trying time being.

SETTLING AN EMPIRE
N)T the least of Arizona's wealth lies in the vast stretches of
fertile lands which extend for hundreds of miles over the
broad valleys, and verdant mountains of the state, with no
owner save the state and federal government.
Altogether the state and government lands in Arizona aggre
gate nearly 35,000,000 acres. Much of it is valueless because of its
location cn mountain tops, or in rocky canyons. But the vast bulk
of it is rich in wealth producing possibilities, either from its agricul
tural grazing, or timber resources.
Of the state approximately 11,000,000 acres, only 300,000 acres
have been sold, and less than 4,000,000 acres are under lease. Of
the federal government's 25,000,000 acres all of it is available for
future settlement and development.
Comparatively few of Arizona's people realize, or If they do real
ize, pro in a position to take advantage of the wonderful opportunity
which these untenanted lands offer. The reason for this is that most
Arizoi);nr. have already pioneered tha sections which now bloom
with cotton, or nre green with alfalfa.
Ilicfc millions of acres must be developed by outside people,
and in the years to come the drama of reclamation and civilization
will be re-enacted in Arizona by the toilers of the cast. Where now
the sag" brush and mesquite grow with none but the lizard and bull
snakc to see, or where tho cedar tree waves in a solitude unbroken
by human presence for hundreds of miles, some day there will be
prosperous farms, where the next generations of Arizonans will be
making Arizona what it is undoubtedly destined to be the most
solidly prosperous state in the union.

GRANT ORE TIME
FOR POWER LINES
PHOENIX. Aug. 29. The railroad
administration has been granted an
extension of time in which to stand
ardize the electrical construction of
the plant and lines serving Winslow
The construction is not in accord with
the standard construction rules laid
down in Order 173 of the corporation
commission, but upon representation
that the validity of an initiative law,
which is still more strict, is being
tried out in the courts, the commis
sion granted an extension of time to
November 1.
The lines to be reconstructed are
the property of the Santa Fe rail
road company. The application for
extension was filed by the local at
torneys for the company, Chalmers,
Stahl, Fennimore and Longan.
KINGMAN COMPANY
WOULD ADD TO RATES
PHOENIX. Aug. 29. The Desert
Power and Water company of King
man has annlied to. the state corpora
tion commission for permission to
make a surcharge of 30 per cent
nhnvo thf? rates set bv the commis
sion for water and electric service in
Kinsman.
The company alleges that the cost
of fuel is so high, that considered
with the other high costs of opera
tion, the income from the business is
less than the expenditure. In addi
tion to this, they point out their de
sire to change the method of construc
tion oi their overhead in compliance
with the orders and rules of the com
mission. The matter will be com
sidered in its turn.

who are to strike. We wish the

Perhaps one reason for the high
cost of living is because too many men
are attempting to wear $15 silk shirts

WOMEN'S RIGHTS
As another example of the feminism
movements progress, the dancing
masters at their convention in the
east have decided that mere man has
been the leader too long. Hereafter
the lady shall do half the leading. In
stead of spraining her ankles dancing
backwards for tw or three hours
straight while her partner glides along
following hi nose, she will now have
the right to put on the reverse English

words, daneing is to be on a fifty-fifty

walk out and that the strike was a
"conspiracy."

SAW SNAKE DANCE AND
PRONOUNCES IT GOOD.
JEROME. Aug. 29. More enthus

snake dance as a spectacle and en

to the iand of the Hopi. He made the
trip with no trouble and came back
with Jerome air in all tires.
The ceremonial was exactly the
same as in former years, says Miller,
who has long been an ardent snake
dance fan. The Hopis have been un
spoiled by contact with the white
man's civilization and their various
waird rites reinai i the same 'as they
were a thousand years ago. They
have numerous lodges and each lodge
has its own dance. Their principal
dances are the corn, antelope and
snake; they will talk freely about all
of them except the snake dance but
they insist on keeping inviolate the
secrets of that ritual.
About seventy automobiles were at
tho snake dance this year. Miller,
however, was the only spectator from
the Verde district. Most of the cars
went out from llolbiook.
"I thought 1hat I had seen the

two years. It looks as if history
might repeat itself. Each of the in
dustries, according to the voice of its
experts, finds it impossible to lower
prices. Yet prices have a way of top
pling, despite the demonstrations of
j the expert. And as to this also his
tory may repeat itself.
OFF HIGH HORSE
New York Tribune.
If the President, after six months
of delay, would now have an early rat
ification of the treaty let him desist
from captious opposition. To his Sen
atorial callers he admitted that iiiost
of the proposed reservations are com
patible with his understandings of
the covenant's obligation. Why, then,
object to their inclusion? He will
surely not seriously contend that the
other countries will cal over inter
pretations which will but restate that
which, according to his readings, Is
already in the treaty. It has taken a
long tussle to induce the President to
dismount from a high horse. But ono
foot is now out of its stirrup and the
other will soon be likewise free.

"Attorney General Talmer thinks
jail best means to deal with profi

rated in the very active close.

LATEST NOTES
OF OIL FIELDS
Tillman county's first oil well has
been struck. It was brought in by the
Fred Till Oil company on the Duncan
farm, six miles west of Frederick, and
at a depth of 1072 fe, about 24 feet
in tne sand, it yesterday indicated be
tween 500 and 1000 barrels production.
Tillman county is just across the Red
river. Many Bisbeeites will be inter
ested in the strike.
The Duke Dome Oil company's No.
1 Snodgrass, at the northeast corner
of the Brading survey, is connected at
the slush pit, blowing mft gas, and oil
is flowing by the heads. Drillers were
setting a six-inch casing yesterday.
Drilling on the El Paso-Burkburnett
company lease on block 88 is continu
ing successfully. The oil in well No.
1 is running into the tanks. The first
two wells on the lease are ready to
be brought in as soon as pipeline con
nections are provided and the third
will be drilled as soon as casing can
be secured.
The Magnoliat Petroleum company
on the east line and center of the J. T.
Carruth farm, one and a half miles
northwest of Desdemona, is construct
ing a four-unit compression plant for
the purpose of making casing head
gasoline.. Pump3 with a capacity of
2,000,000 feet of gas daily will pull the
gas from the wells, and the daily gas-
olen capicity of the plant will be 4500

MUNICIPAL MARKET OPENS THIS
DIN II
We'll say that 8 o'clock Saturday
morning, August 30, will be the date
of the opening of an entirely new
chapter in thj account books ot
housekeeping in the Warren district.
Figuratively speaking, we may ex
pect that the sorely tired housewife,
who has been acquiring grayness ot
the temples trying to adjust last
month's income to this month's scale
of prices, who is straining to meet
the luxury tax on necessities, will
throw up her hat and utter a fervent
"viva" over We accomplished fact of
the long-anticipated public market,
the establishment of which is to
make possible the trimming sway of
a wide margin of expense from that
frightful bugaboo and bogey H. C. L.
What will really happen, if the
said housewife, severally and collec
tively, is the provident and thought
ful person we believe her, is first an
unusually early rising hour; second,
a sallying forth, market basket in
hand, either on foot or by (automo
bile, to the old Central theatre site
in Lowell. The location is an admir
able one, and but a short distance
from the car line.
Emphasis is laid upon the advis
ability of the mfarketer beating the
early bird to the worm which, in this
case, is the freshest of the fruit,
melons and vegetables.
It is unreasonable to suppose that

Bisbee Girl Returns
Frpnj Archaeological
Research Expedition
Miss Edith Newman of Opera Drive,
a student at the state university, has
just returned from the Grand canyon
and the Navajo mountains, where un
der the supervision of Dean A. E.
Cummings, extensive research work
was done. The permit was granted
under the heading of Archaeological
Field Course Work. Many valuable
relics were uncovered, including
shells, pottery, etc. Miss Newman was
the second while woman to ever make
the perilous descent to the world's
largest natural bridge, Nonnezashie
Arch. They returned by way of Walpi,
the Hopi village, where the ' annual
ceremonial snake dances were per
formed. It was a very interesting trip
for all.
The party included Professor Clue of
Chicago, Mr. Ferriss, government col
lector of . snails; Professors Scott,
Vickery and Ruben of Globe; Miss
Wales of Missouri-and Miss Davis of
Los Angeles.
The students from the university
were Misses Blanche and Mary Jean
Smith, Fred Bohnert, Howard Bene
dict, Alfred Wilson and Franklin
Walker.
McGregor to Design
Smelter in Peru
A. Q. McGregor, who has gained a
national reputation as a designer or
modern smelting 7ork3, arrived in the
city last night from hid home at war
ren, Arizona, and will be in the dis
trict several days. 'He designed the
international smeUer at Miami, and
nearly all important smelting plants
fn Arizona, including that of the C. &
A. at Douglas, United Verde Exten
sion at Jerome and, Arizona Copper
company at Clifton. Ml.-McGregor's
latest Important engagement is with
Ae Cerre de Pasco Comer company t
design a great smelter to be erected
n their copper property in Peru. The
construction of this plant, which ia
to be one of the srreatest smelters in
the world, was delay! by the war,
cs It was impossible to obtain mate
rials required. Contracts have since
been made on more favorable terms,
deliveries of machinery and steel are
I ow being made and construction will
proceed ' without further interruption.

Six certificates to teach were issued
to residents of Cochise county by the

today. Of this number three were first

ond class certificates.
Sixty-six certificates were issued al
together to applicants in all counties
'except Gila and Pinal.
Certificates were issued to the fol

Church Attendance
Contest Ends Today
With "Rally Sunday" tomorrow
morning, the eight week attendance
competition being conducted by the
Sunday school scholars of the Chris
tian church will close. In the two
months the attendance has been rais
ed from fifty to one hundred and sev
en, according to W. H. Matthes, the
pastor. v
The competition was scheduled to
close last Sunday, but at that time an
exact tie on points existed between the
boy and girl teams at 1271 points. It
was. therefore, decided to carry out
the attendance race for another week.
At tomorrow morning's services
which will be held at 9:30 o'clock, the
time and place of the annual Sunday
school picnic will be announced.
L
market will find all the machinery
greased and running noiselessly.
Bisbee has not before bad a public
market and the business, like any
other will take adjusting, here and
there, before the high stage of per
fection which is aimed fat by those
having this long-looked for and most
necessary enterprise in hand is
reached. In the nature of things
there will be awkwardness and bog
gling and mistakes at the commence
ment, but the benefits are bound to
so greatly overshadow the annoyance
that it is believed the Bisbee market
ing nublic will be as tolerant of
small laxities as a Bisbee public has
ever proven in the past, with the r&
sultant good will of the farmers and
organizers and the fostering among
the latter of ia spirit . to excel the
markets of all other cities of Bisbee's
class.
The great point is that the market,
to live, must have patronage, not
desultory buying one day in ia month
or so, but regular, well calculated
shopping for all table necessities"
which its various stalls may afford
In this way. the suppliers of fruit
and chickens, of squabs and honey
and eggs and melons, -may learn to
estimate the demand and to plan and
raise accordingly.
If the market starts' off auspicious
ly today, it will be open two days
a week hereafter on Saturday and
Wednesdays.

Kidnapping Charge
Dropped in Face of
Testimony of Girl
Upon the admission of 15-year-oW
Clotilde Duarte, whom he was accused
of kidnaping, that she, herself, made
the engagement to run away with him
and marry him, Francsco Celedo'waa
crdered released from custody yes
terday by Justice James Allison fol
lowing a brief hearing. He was or

Upon Sugar Rations
Bisbee is still on sugar rations of
two pounds to each customer, but it
is expected that with the failure of
the railroad strike, the "lid" will be
lifted. Despite the fact that no ro-
duce was received .from the coast for!
.more than a week, there was no short-1
age here. What threatened to be a do
tato famine was averted by farmers in
this district, who brought In enough
of the tuberB to supply the demand.
No California fruit was received, but
there was plenty of local peaches, ap
ples and melons and a big supply of
bananas from the east. .
