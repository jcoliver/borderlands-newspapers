were arrested here December 22nd

of dynamite with having explosives in
their possession unlawfully. A third
true bill charged Hood with illegally

It was the arrest of Hood and Voet
ter that led to a raid on the Industrial
Workers of the World headquarters
here, in which a number of men were
taken into custody and a large amount
of documentary evidence was seized.
Much of this evidence was presented
i to the grand jury while the probe was
being conducted and some of it was
quoted in the conspiracy indictment
which was returned today.
Many in Custody

dieted today, including Hood and Voet-1
ter, have been in custody here since

Planned on Overman BilL
(Bv Review Lrued Wire)
WASHINGTON. Feb. 8. Except for
more senate discussion led by Senator
Thomas, a Democrat of the military
committee, who paused the army's ac
complishments, defended Secretary
Baker and opposed the war cabinet
bill, there were no moves today in the
controversy over war efficiency and
organization.
y common consent, further action
w postponed until next week. Both
the senate and the military committee
adiourned until Monday,
Tomorrow the conference or Repub-
lican senators will be held. Republt-
can Leader Gallinger today denied
that solid party action upon pending
legislation is planned. I
Senator Thomas renewed debate In
the senate. He asserted the war de -
i Bailment's record should be D raised
and that Secretary Baker's statement
before the committee was "a story
re-j
i
plete with accomplishments.
Opposing the war cabinet bill, he de-1
clared it would add "another link to
the chain that already binds us," and
take away the president's powers as
commander in chief.
Chamberlain Answers
During the discussion. Senator Cham
berlain, chairman of the military com
mittee, replied to criticism from Sen
ator Lewis, Democratic whip, regard
ing the committee's examination of
Mr. Baker. The latter suggested that
the secretary should have been called
before the committee at first Instead
of after witnesses had presented at
tacks. Senator Chamberlain said the
committee's procedure followed the ex
press request of the secretary.
The military committee met today
but did not attempt to consicer the
war cabinet measure, nor continue its
war inquiry. Both matters were post

"Dr. C. H. Hunt, :
County Health Officer.
Cochise County. Ariz. ?
Dear Dr. Hunt: !
After a personal investigation of the !
small-pox situation in the Bis bee-War-:

to place an absolute quarantine upon
J the entire district, until such a time
I as it is safe for the protection of the !

tine
The limits of the quarantine shall be:
As far east as Forest Ranch.
As far west as Louisiana-Arizona
mine.
As far north as head of Brewery

As far south as Osborn and South
Don Louis. i
You will at once place sufficient
armed guards at these limits and al
low no one to leave the district with
out written permission which will be
given only onjha most urgent neces
sity, such as.T. S. Government offi
cials, army officers and such other
persons, after using all precautions
necessary to prevent the spread of the
epidemic to other sections.

Asks For Co-operation
In a statement last night Sweek j
said that if everyone co-operated in i
j harmony with the county and state '
jotiicials that he hoped it would be pos-
Isible to lift the quarantine within ten
days. This will of course be contin-
! geut entirely upon future develop-
ments and depend on no new cases de-:

jthe disease is under complete control j
: at that time.
Although armed guards were placed
on the roads leading from and into
Bisbee yesterday at 1 o'clock, the
quarantine edict by the state superin-
tendent or public health, it was not
generally known that such action had
even been contemplated until after the

Sweek. Hunt and Brown, Vance John

Dr. Sweek Fpoke and explained that
the first small-pox case reported to
him had been called to his attention
about the 21st of January when he
came here to investigate conditions.
He mentioned that there were J4 cases
of small pox yesterday and that of that

Continuing. Dr. Sweek explained the
necessity for drastic measures prompt
ly to curb the spread of the disease
and prevent it spreading to outlying
districts and other copper camps. He
also mentioned the need ror taking ev
en more effective measures In war
time to stamp out the epidemic than
might be necessary In peace time, ex
plaining that we are righting an enemy
who knows more about the game of
war than we do and who does not
stop at any atrocity either at home or
elsewhere that German agents are act
ive. There will be no fight made by Bis

WASHINGTON. Feb. S. Presenta

creased pay and time and a half for
ork beyond eiht heurs developed
into a discussion before the railroad
wage board today cf the practicability
of any readjustment of hours now
when there is a shortage of men:
vhirta would hamper operation of
trains.
S. E. Heberling. president of the
Switchmen's union, said the eight
hour law was not bein? generally ob
served because overtime was not pen
alized and asked that instead of a
pro-rata basis, time and a half be im
posed for all work beyond the basic
day.
"Would that be advisable with all
industries handicapped for men?"
asked Secretary Lane of the commis
sion. "Where we you goins; to pet tha
extra men?" asked Coiriiiissioner Cov
ington. Mr. Heberling said it wa3 de
sired to keep the day as closely as
possible . to an eight . hour basis to
minimize accidents due to fati?ue.
Secretary Lane remarked on casualty
figures for switchmen, showing a per
centage greater than fcr the armies
in Eurcpe.
C. I Darling: of Spokane. Wash.,
snd A. S. Iiimrose of Portland. Ore..
f.pneared for the train dispatchers and
asked the government for substantial
wage increases.
"If the railroad presidents would
only meet us half way I wouldn ot
be in Washington today," said Mr.
Eimrose.
"A little more visicn would help."
commented Commissioner McChord.
Thomas McNeil!, representing the
car inspectors of the Pennsylvania
railroad, told the commission the in
spectors should come under the eieht
hour law because of their part in the
cperaticn of trains. The railroal man
agers have refused to concede this.
The philosophy of tipping was ex
pounded to an interested audience by
Robert L. Mays, a dining car waiter
who spoke for unorganized negro em
ployees. He said they received $25
a month wages for sixfen to eighteen
hours daily work. When asked if
they would consent to the elimina
tion of tips ands iibstitution of a hish
er salary, he said he belioved fcoth
waiters and porters would be glad to
U rego tops if their tir was increased

Contl.irr from Pag Orw
Work'-m of the World on the Pacific
coast have planned wholesale destruc
tion of industries and shipping and
other interference with prosecution of
the war. it was said today at the de
partment of justice. The indictment
of fifty-five at Sacramento by a feder
al grand jury is the result of recent
investigations by government agents
who discovered tiiat leaders were plot
tin; systematic sabotage.
The indictment was a direct result
of the recent attempt to blow up the
governor's residence at Sacramento.
Agents discovered a nest of plotters
whose activities extended throughout
the Pacific coast territory.
In addition to blowing up factories,
plotters in that section of the country
had planned to foment strikes among
workmen engaged in war industries,
to damage fruit trees and crops, and
fo lesser extent destroy ships being
built in yards along the coast.

REFUSE TRAWLER'S OFFER
(Pv Review Leaned Wire)
AX IiilSH PORT. Feb. 8. (By the
Associated Press I A small fishing
trawler returned to this port this morn
ing without the 142 Americans it set
out from here to take off from the bar
ren northerly shore, which the Ameri
cans had reached in three lifeboats
fourteen hours after the Tuscania was
sunk.
The skipper of the trawler told the
British commodore here that the Am
erican captain in charge of the party
refused to embark his men on the
trawler because the little vessel did
not carry lifeboats sufficient to hold
all of the troops in case the trawler
was torpedoed.
This party, according to the captain
of the trawler, consists of two captains
and 14!) men who reached the shore a
short distance from the point where
the bodies of forty-four Americans
were washed up yesterday. The traw
ler had made a perilous journey to
reach the Americans. The sea was
chovpy but the trawler kept her course
until she reached the point where the
Americans were marooned.
On the arrival of the trawler the
British authorities sent a large steam
er to bring the Americans to Glasgow.
This vessel has sufficient lifeboats to
take care of the men in case it should
run afoul of an underwater boat.

FARMERS WANT
REPRESENTATION
WASH!
(By Review Leased Wire)
WASHINGTON. Feb. S Spokesmen
of 16 national farm organizations and
many smaller ones, holding a war
time conference here at the call ot
the federal board of farm loans, pre
sented a memorial to President Wil
son today urging definite government
al measures speedins up agricultural
production.
The delegation asked for the ap
pointment of a special commission ot
nine farmers to advise on agricultural
problems and represent the farming
viewpoint; for the furlouging of train
ed farm workers now in the army so
long as their services may be consid
ered more useful In productive agricul
tural than the military service; that
the draft regulations be interpreted so
as to stop the placing of skilled farm
workers, foremen and bonafide farms
in class one, that provision be made
for furnishing farmers seed, feed, fer
tilizers and machinery; that steps be
takea to promote short time loans to
finance the production cf crops and
that if the policy of price control if
to prevail, it be applied to what a
farmer buys as well as to what he
sells.
After listeniug to the memorial.
President Wilson made this reply:
"I cannot. ' of course, answer oft
hand, so important a memorial as this
and I need not tell you that it will
receive my most careful and respect
ful attention. .Many of the questions
that are raised here have been mat'ers
of very deep and constant concern
with us for months past and I believe
that many of them are approaching
as successful a solutions as we can
work out for them, but just what those
steps are I cannot now detail to you.
You are probably familiar witu some
of the.
"1 want to say that 1 fully realize
that you gentlemen do not mean that
your utmost effort will be dependent
upon the acceptance of these sitjses
tions.' I know you are itoi&e to do
your level best in any circumstances,
and I count on you with the utmost
confidence in that. There hts never
been a time, gentlemen, wIiTi tested
the real quality of folks a? 'his time
is going to test it; because "e are
fighting tor something bsKr than
la.iy man's imagmaton can r.rani.
'This is a final tackle between the
things that America has always been
! opposed to. and was organized to fight
! and the things that she stands for.
j It is the final contest, and to lose it
! would set the world back, not with
: hundreds perhaps several hundreds
of years in the development of human
! life. This thing cannot be exaggerated
; in its -'mportance and I know that you
! men are ready, as I am. to spend ev-
ery ounce of energy-we have got in
! solving this thing. If we cannot solve
i it in the best way. we will solve it in
j the next test way. and if the next best
i way is not available, we will solve it
I in the wa next best to that, but we
' will tackle it in some way and do it
as well as we can.
"I am complimented by a visit of so
j large a representation and I thunk
: you for the candid presentation of this
interesting memorial."
' In recommending the creation of a
farmers commission to sit permanent-
: ly in Washington with provision by
j the government for quarters and ex
1 penses, the memorial said:
"Such a commission is needed first
' of all fo give the farmers of America
a sense of partnership in the conduct
of the war. to which they have a right.
' The occasional consultation with lar
! uiers called to Washington cr the oc
casional pppointment of a farmer to a
! suiwrdinate place does not amount to
fitting participation in the conduct of
the war on the part of one-third of tne
population of the I'nited States and ali
the more when that third produces the
i one form of supplies which is the most
essential.
"This plan would be in harmony
with the procedure already adopted by
the government in other essential in
dustries. The creation of such a com
mission would convince ait farmiTs
that our viewpoint was fully represent
ed in Washington and always accessi
ble to the president and would inspire
and encourage them as nothing vise
could."
The memorial approved the propos
al to issue $4.mmi.immi.o)Mi in Ixmds to
finance essential industries and sug
gested that assistance for food produc
tion would pot Involve any vast expen
ditures.

The Quarantine
And so we are to he shut in for a few days because
of a few cases of smallpox in a mild form. Oh, very well;
let as make the best of it We will have to be sufficient
unto ourselves for a little while. It will hurt some, but
then there are lots of things that hurt. The order may
well be too drastic; the officials may he taking this
whole thing too seriously, but then, even if that Is the
case, there is nothing to do but make the best of it. If
they err. it is on the safe side, and that is a grand little
side upon whkh to err.
It is only for ten days. They might have made it for
a year. , .
Let. us grin and bear it. Ten days is not so very long.
Far be it from us" to spread s pestilence all over
Arizona.
So, let ns stay home, then, and work and play and
wait for the' smallpox terror to pass away. No new cases
since yeeterday. No one dead yet. Just a little quaran
tine placed upon a big district If the authorities are
frightened, still we are safe; if they have only taken
necessary precautions against a menace, still we are safe.
We win to safety in either case, and lose some business
at the same time.
And then, consider, maybe we gad about too much,
and thus are punished like naughty children by being
made to stay at home. The outside world will doubtless
picture us as in a moft pitiable state, wrestling terribly
with the dread plague of smallpox, trying to bury our
dead as fast as they die and fleeing to the rocks and
caves for safety. Wtien the fact is, but few people In
the district would know there was a smallpox case
within forty miles if they had not read it in the papers
and asked about the clcsed theatres and seen guards
hurrying to their posts. -
The sinking of the Tuscania by a submarine is the
first blow struck by the Hun after the uttermost of ef
fort for six months against the procession of ships load
ed with fighting men that have been sailing to and fro
across the sea. It is a hard blow, but it is the only one
made against the transportation of more than a half
million troops. Other such blows will fall upon, us. at
the ships will sail on, and the troops will be moved to
France. Neither the sea nor land will be safe until the
fight is won and the sacrifice made. The submarine so
far has failed to win foi Germany. But it is still a
menace. It must be fought every hour of every day and
must be reckoned with by every one in the job of winning
the war. That our first considerable loss should come
from the submarine was to be expected. The Lusitania
was sunk by a submarine and the loss of life there was
greater than in the ca.se of. the Tuscania. and then we
were not at war. The Teuton reckons that the sinking
of the Tuscania will frighten Americans to death, but
men from the western republic will still go down to the
sea in ships, and when they come back from over there
the sea m ill be cleansed of the submarine.
The porkless and beefiess days have stripped El Paso
of its chickens, ducks and turkeys and the shortage is
alarming, according to the Times of that city. ."Near
famine in the poultry market." the headlines read. And
fish, the standby of all towns and cities of the southwest
within a day's ride of the Gulf of Mexico or the Pacific
coast, are higher and harder to secure. Looks like we
will have to fall back upon frijoles before long or go
hungry.
I agree with Mr. Schwab that the workers are going
to rule; but under the term "workers" I include the bank
ers, teachers, inventors and managers. nd I expect that
in the future, as in the recent past, this latter class of
workers will do moist of the ruling and most of the solv
ing of the great economic questions. Charles W. Eliot

AS THE WAR WEARS ON.
Henry Clews, the New York banker, views the na
tion's business affairs as follows:
Aside from war infuences, the business situation is
considerably confused by the coal crisis, the serious con
gestion of freight and the great expansion of government
control over industry; an expedient that is not always
working as successfully as desired. The price fixing ! ...... . , ... , . '

factor. Scarcity is the rule in nearly all products and
instrumentalities, and high prices are inevitable while
the war lasts. Readjustment to 'such conditions is un
avoidable, and is already developing in the form of econ
omy among non-essential products.
Our government is also urging economy in food. fuel,
clothing, wool, and many other articles. Great Britain
is in the meantime economizing on meats, fats and bread,
and urgently appealing to us for more wheat. These
calls are imperative, and they unsettle business. On the
other hand the high prices which such articles command,
and the activity of the steel and munition industries,
are bringing to the interior a high degree of prosperity,
tvhlch promises to last for some time to come, because
a long period must elapse before production catches up
with consumption, even when peace comes.
Both the agricultural and the industrial outlooks, so
far as essentials' are concerned, are encouraging; and
our farmers and industrial workers are seemingly assured
of another prosperous season. The chief drawbacks mill
be the almost complete portponement of new enterprise;
the stoppage of building, and the lessened demand for
many luxuries. The spirit of extravagance has been
sensibly moderated by a keener realization of the war
and its consequences.
Upon the whole, therefore, the business outlook is en
couraging, although facing certain adjustments that can
not be evaded, and certain pitfalls that will have to be
skilfully passed . ever. So far as the stock market Is
concerned, much the same must be salu. Many securi
ties are selling at very attractive prices; but all pur
chases, whether for Investment or speculation, should
be made with particuar scrutiny and confined to the
better class of concerns. There is considerable short j By including the Warren district

ache, backache, fever and the general
effects of the disease which greatly
resemble la grippe.
Only by curbing the disease by dras
tic measures at the outset, since so
many people here have been exposed,
can it be stamped out and the great
loss of life that would necessarily fol
low if the epidemic spreads, be pre
vented, according to Dr. Sweek.
Even persons with old vaccination
scars are not immune to small pox in
a vicinity where the germs get scat
tered and the epidemic gains a strong
hold, says Dr. Sweek. and should the
disease go that far here he warns that
many deaths would likely occur.
He stated that in his opinion the
quarantining of such a large district
would not work as great a hardship on
Bisbee proper as would the quarantin
ing of the city only.
Stages Taken Off
The quarantine on all amusements
as outlined in yesterday's Review will
continue and violations of the order
mill be dealt m-ith severely.
The Douglas-Bisbee stage and other
stage lines have been discontinued un
til the quarantine is lifted.
Sheriff Harry Wheeler explained
last night that violations of the quar
antine and failure of the armed guards
mhich he had ordered posted on outly
ing roads would result in prosecution
and that the penalty was not less tbsn
30 days in jail and a fine of ISO.
Dr. Sweek told yesterday how he
had been through the New Orleans
and Louisiana fever epidemic and h.id
worked through the entire time as he
had previously contracted yellow fever
and was immune from it and said that
he knew the seriousness of a great epi
demic and that it was to prevent such
a thing here and keep the disease from
spreading that he had declared the
Quarantine on the Bisbee and Warren
I District.
interest in this market, though good buying usually
develops on all sharp declines, and the result is frequent
fluctuations within comparatively narrow limits. The
exigencies of war leave the market exposed to sudcXra
movements at any time.
and not making the quarantine effect
ive only in the city of Bisbee, it is pos
sible for the mines to continue in op
eration and turn out copper greatly
needed in the prosecution of the war.
Dr. Sweek also cited the necessity of
confining the disease to this locality
and not permitting it to spread to oth
er mining ramps and thus possibly
