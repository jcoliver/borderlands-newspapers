WITH THE KRKXCH ARMY IN"
FRANCE, Anril 21 (Sunday) When
an entire German regiment, reinforc
ed by storm troops, attacked the sec
tor held by American troops near
Seiehsprey, General Pershing's men
fought the most serious engagement
they have yet exjerienced.
The attack was made by a consid
erable force and indications show that
important preparations were made for
it. I'misual precautions were imme
diately taken along the whole sector
of the front as soon as the German
in tent ion was known.
An extremely heavy hostile bom
bardment with poison gas shells open
ed during the course of the night and
lasted until 5 o'clock in the morning.
At that houf the tnemy infantry
dashed forward, preceded by storm
troops which had been brought to the
scene especially for the attack, after
preliminary training on ground simi
lar to the sector held by the American
troops.
The assault was over a line 2000
yards in length and at several places
the enemy succeeded in entering the
American lines. They even entered
and occupied Seicheprey, where the
Americans holding that position -offered
the most stubborn defense.

Without a moment's delay, after
1een lively artillery fighting.
The attack on the Americans at
Seicheprey, east of St. Mihiel, now ap
pears to have been a carefully planned
operation which had as its objective
the piercing of American lines or per
haps the splitting of the American and
French forces, which are -holding ad
jacent' positions there. It inet with dje

savage attack on the American forces
at Seicheprey on Saturday, there has
been no fighting of an extraordinary
nature along the front, but there rfave
been indications that the Teutons are
almost ready to resume the siedge
; hammei blows they have been aiming
at Hie allied armies.
I'nless recent operations have been
feints, it is probable that the com
iiig week will witness two great turn
ing movements by the Germans. One
probal.iy will pivot on the village of
I Hobsvo. northwest of eBthune. on the
nort:i side of the Soinnie salient.
Attacks Drawn Off
The purpose of these movements
will lie to cut deep into the Allied
linen on each side of the promontory
tha: projects out into German held
ten lory and terminates on the old
Arras-Lens front. The Gentians have
atempted two great frontal attacks on
the intense of Lens and Arras, but
i thej have been repulsed with terrible
lossi"s to the attackers. These losses
were inflicted upon the enemy before
he leached the stronger allied posi
tions in that sector and since the sec
ond deteat at Festubert and Givenchy.
Jhe Germans have not cared to take
up the task of driving the Canadians
from their positions along Vimy
Ride and on each end of that great
naturaf bulwark before Arras.
If successful attacks were" to' be
launched by the Germans at Robectj
and Mesnil. the British might be
fo-ced to withdraw from Arras with
out having a chance to defend their
positions there. Heavy artillery fire
at both places has been reported and

THE BISBEE DAILY REVIEW, TUESDAY MORNING, APRIL 23, 1918.
JUNCTIONS PLAY FINE
BALL AND COP GAME
No Imogens tha wd bombard-'
inent Sunday p. m. was not a German
long range gun in the o fling but mere
ly tbe echo oftbe J-B bats as the
players swung these with great nusto
and collected 22 base hits, deefating
the Copper Queen team 22 to 10 in a
free clubbing contest.
Pitch and duck was the order of
the day with both teams hammering
tbe spheroid back at the mound crt
ists who sidestepped enough times to
be in perfect practice for a tango con
test. Toner chucked a nice game for
the J-B. i
Bill Leverett essayed to flint; for
the Queen when on the sick list ani
lasted quick.' At times he was wild
and hit the backstop and again he
showed perfect control and hit the
J-H bats with unerring precision. Han
son took up where Leverett left off
in the second spasm and retired the
two men needed to end the inniag. It
was too much asking Hanson to hurl
fcfter pitching on Wednesday, and
when his arm tired Tonneson was
called in from right field.
Have Hard Luck
The J-B gang outhit and outplayed
the Queen p&stitners and as is usually
the case the winning team secured all
of the breaks of luck. Two line drives
with three men on base would have
added six runs to tbe Queen total had
they gone Bate. Stadelli hit one which
landed in Miller's glove. Tonneson hit
one which was a half inch outside
the right field foul line, which is as
crooked as a dog's hind leg and has
a camel's hump where Tonny's drive
landed.
Another instance of the way luck
hvored the winners was shown in tbe
oighth inning when with three men on
bases and to out Miller grabbed his
bat in Ihe middle to advertise that
he was going to bunt. This was re
garded as camouflage by Laurcnson
who ran toward third base and let
the bunt go for a base hit Fielded
this would have retired tbe side but
instead a run crossed as did seven
more before tbe inning ended. Eight
runs on a bad piece of baseball, bunt
ing with, the bases full'and two hands
down.
Play Rcal Baseball
The J-B boys showed up well anil de
serve credit for the game they played
afield and at bat. Pitman hit three
squarely on the nose while fiojoin
one of the sweetest looking hitters
in the circuit who bats from both
sides pickled four base knocks. IHt
to for Johnson. Harris and Krigbaum
each got three.
Deke Lebrant netted three hits for
the Queen with Wilson, Hanson and
Laurenson each making a brace of
safeties.
The J-B infield with Miller at first,
Birkcl second, Johnson third and
Krigbaum short, looks excellent. Wat
ers did well behind the bat for his
first appearance in months. Bejoin,
Pitman and Harris comprise a neat
outfield.

missal from the presidency of that in

The association went even further

unanimously adopting resolutions call

Tl:e removal by Hunt of Dr. Blome on
indefinite charges of pro-Germanism,

Use Soothing Musterole j
When those 6harp pains go shooting
through your head, when your skull '
seems as it it would split, just rub a '
little Musterole on your temples and
neck. It draws out the inflammation, j
soothes away tbe pain, usually giving
quick relief. !
Musterole is a dean, white ointment, '
made with oil of mustard. Better than a
mustard plaster and does not blister.
Many doctors and nurses frankly rec
ommend Musterole for sore throat, bron
chitis, croup, stiff neck, asthma, neural
gia, congestion, pleurisy, rheumatism,
lumbago, pains and aches of the back or
oints. sprains, sore muscles, bruises,
chilblains, frosted feet colds of the

in Bisbee yesterday while a great
many small purchases were made. It
is the latter which are desired in
particular for the big object of this
drive is to sell a bond to every citi
zen who can afford to purchase one.
The greater number of bonds sold the
better it shows there is a larger num
ber of patriotic people in a commun
ity. Denver has reported nearly 40,000
different subscribers and other cities
are striving hard to register as many
individual purchasers as possible.
With but twelve more days of the
drive remaining everyone who has so
far failed to purchase a bond or sev
eral is urged to get into the game
and do his and her share toward beat
ing the Huns. Many persons who are
able to do so are buying bonds and
giving these as birthday presents and
this is a very good idea which manv
others will no doubt adopt. Those who
have purchased a bond but who can
afford to buy more should do bo at
once in order that this district will
be certain to go over the top and if
possible exceed the quota of the sec

McCluskey
It is aid that the German kaiser in
vested ten million dollars in Bolo Pasha, the
French traitor, who was executed 'ast week.
Wonder what the kaiser thought of his in
vestment as it lay, a huddled heap at the
foot of the Vincennes wall in the gray
chill of a spring morning with only a grim
French officer and ten Poilus whose faces
expressed the bitter hate they felt for the
scoundrel as they pressed the triggers that
sped his doom? The kaiser also has an
other investment on hand, being nothing
less than the throwing of a million and a
half of men into the war crater. France
was the prize of the Bolo investment, and
France is the prize for this last venture.
Bolo's blood has dampened a spot on French
soil. The blood of three-quarters of a mil
lion Gerrpun .soldiers has bathed French soil
the past month. The last investment, prom
ising well at the first, now looks about as
badly u3 the Bolo venture, which also prom-
H. S. McClusky, professional agitator and regent
of the University of Arizona, sounded the only dis
cordant note at what would have otherwise been a
splendid meeting of the Luncheon Club Friday when
he stated that the entire press of Arizona is dis
credited and that he preferred to be criticized to being
complimented by the newspapers. Tucson Citizen.
The weight of the evidence is against
Mister McCluskey. When ALL the news
papers of the state assail him and he pub
licly proclaims at a peaceful dinner party
thtt he prefers the attacks rather than the
praise of the press, then he places himself
beyond the pale of decent men. One news
paper might err, and another might be
moved by personal feeling, and another be
misled or misinformed, but when all of
them agree to brand and denounce this rad-'
ical and dangerous agitator and promotor
of class hatred, then has the verdict been
written and read to the court by the fore
man of the jury. The day of the McClus
keys has gone forever from Arizona, along
with the day of the dance halls and the sa
loons and the gambling dens and the
Apache raids and the stage robbers of the
old times, and the I. W. W. propagandas
and German agent activities of more recent
times. As the Citizen has well said, Mc
Cluskey is a "professional." Now a pro
fessional agitator makes his living from
labor troubles, strikes, threats, picket lines,
violence and all the lamentable and unfor
tunate things that go with wobblyism and
the more radical labor troubles. The can
dle may flicker high a few times before it
goes out, even as the bootlegger attempts to
check the prohibition wave, but McClusky
ism and Huntism and wobblyism have been
doomed by the spirit of the times and the
flame of patriotism and the "imperative
needs of the Great War. Workers are need
ed now, not professional obstructors. The
soapbox orator was thrown down and his
pedestal broken when the U. S. Govern
ment moved against the wobblies. from
coast to coast. The agitator is too closely
linked with the German agent and the com
mon enemy of mankind to be safe in the
land today. That a man of the McCluskey
type should have been elevated by Hunt to
a temporary place of dignity and impor
tance in state affairs is one of those unfor
tunate outcroppings of our political system
which makes such strange bedfellows. But
the stay of such men in high places io brief
in this progressive age of publicity. Mc
Clusky may malign and defy the press of
his state with his voice, but in his heart he is
sore afraid. Publicity is the most deadly
weapon ever used against the enemies of
the public welfare. In the end it never fails,
if used for the right against the wrong; for
the best against the worst. There are two
sides to Arizona politics today, and two
only; one is devoted to the building up of
the state upon permanent and prosperous
foundations, and the other is devoted to
tearing down and laying waste. And there
can be only one ultimate outcome to this
struggle. The Bolsheviki won in Russia,
but this is America, praise be, and not the
besotted, benighted land that the agitators
laid waste with the torch of radicalism and
then betrayed to the Prussian king.
ised well at first. The kaiser's only part
nership, admitted, is with "Gott," but his
investments have to do solely with the
blood and misery of mankind, risked with
a most reckless hand for his own glory and
gain.
OUR BUSINESS IS WAR
Kansas City Star : The call grows loud
er daily. Every German thrust brings it
home to us. At terrible cost England and
France hold the western front. If only we
had a million fighting men there to help
them!
We must send that million and millions
more. Only by overwhelming force from
America can the German power be crushed.
Only by force fed by such sacrifice and de
votion as America has not yet dreamed of.
We must get in this war to the limit.
We must speedily build an army of 5 mil
lion men. We must be ready to make it
1 0 million if necessary. We must hurry
the ships. We must command the air. We
must build guns, more guns, and still more
guns.
War must be our one business. Every
thing else must be subordinate.
There is no trouble to get the men.
Every boy is proud to go every family is
proud to send its sons.
"I enlisted with my son," said a devoted
Kansas City mother. Millions of mothers
are ready in the same spirit.
The Nation must see that this devotion
shall not be in vain. We must be prepared,
everyone of us, to do our part. The bill for
a military census of all men from 18 to 50
is right. Each person must be at the dis
posal of the government. If the govern
ment needs him in a shipyard, in an air
plane factory, in a wheat field, he must go.
We must all be soldiers. Some must
serve in France, most in America. All must
serve.
The German nation, said Lloyd George,
is a spear ; the army the head, the people the
shaft. Then the American nation must be
a machine gun ; the soldiers the bullets, the
people at home the barrel and firing mech
anism. Public opinion must press the govern
ment to wider planning, vaster efforts,
greater speed. In their turn the people must
respond cheerfully with whatever sacrifice
is required.
Only by preparing in such a spirit can
we do our duty by the men ve send to
France. Only so can we insure the tri
umph of the high cause we fight for.
Half way measures will not do. To
help just a little is to fail!
Entire suspension of infantry attacks in
the Armentieres sector by the Germans
during the past twenty-four hours would
indicate, judging from the trend of all of
fensives since the war was started, that the
worst is over. And the Germans, while
gaining much ground and even threaten
ing disaster at one time, have failed signal
ly of their objectives, when these objectives
are considered in proportion to the price
they paid for goods they did not get. The
same is true of the offensive on the Somme,
which ceased several weeks ago. The much
heralded German peace drive to victory
started just a month ago today. They have
lost doubtless about three-quarters of a mil
lion men and have gained but little ground
cept that which had been wrested
from them during the past two years at less
than half the price. More troops and great
er efforts and heavier losses must attend
the holding of these two salient3 gained at
such a fearful cost, even if Foch does not
drive them back with a counter attack. Al
lied reserves have not been drawn upon at
all, that is to say the mobile reserve created
by the council of Versailles. When this
army strikes it will be the supreme allied
effort of the war. Of course, no one be
lieves that the German offensive is over by
any means. Much hard fighting is doubt
less ahead and another tremendous thrust
may be looked for at any hour. The Ger
mans cannot afford to stop now without
acknowledging defeat of their main pur
pose. But the real force and menace of the
German drive to destroy either of the allied
armies is believed to have come to an end
with the terrible defeat of Thursday along
LeBasse canal and before Givenchy when
the pick and flower of the kaiser's forces
were slaughtered by the thousand by Brit
ish gunfire and bayonets.
Another of the inexplicable movements
of the state executive has arisen. Hunt
and McClusky left Phoenix for Tucson on
the evening Secretary McAdoo was due to
arrive in Phoenix. They gave aj a reason
a meeting of the board of regents at the
University. But a train the next morning
would have delivered them in the Old
Pueblo in time for that meeting
WILLIAMS CASE IS
STILL OH TRIAL
AT TOMBSTONE
Koch Causes Sensation by
Writing Note Exonerating
Williams and Then Getting
on Stand and Stating Con'
tents a' Lie
(Special to The Review)
TOMBSTONE. April 20. The rase
of Stat vs. Dave Williams, charged
with assault with intent to commit
murder Is still on trial. The state
closed it3 case at 2:30 this afternoon
after having called the following wit
nesses: Mrs. L. Gallen, Tombstone;
re-called George Cook, night watch
man of Douglas; Fred Nessbaumer,
Tombstcne; H. B. Brandt; Guy C.
Welch; Cecil Adams; J. K. McDaniels;
re-cfllfd Koch. The recalling of Koch
came after Koch had early this morn
ing written a note to Williams in jail,
which read as follows: Mr. Ross:
Please turn Mr. Williams out as he
a not guilty. I testify because I was
toll so. (Signed) Fred H. Koch.
(Misspelled words are Koch's). On
the witr.ES stand this afternoon.
Ko:h testified that he wrote the note
to Williams, addressed to Mr. Ross,
county attorney, because he tTi sorry
for Williams' wife and little children.
On the wtness stand this afternoon
he testified thpt everything in the note
was a lie, and what he had testified
yesterday, implicating Williams in the
plot to hold up the bank, and which
resulted in the shooting of Brandt,
was the absolute truth. There were
many incidents of humor which came
out of the testimony of many o the
witnesses.
The defense opened their case at
2:30 with Mrs. D. D. Williams, wife
of the defendant, as their first wit
ness. The other witnesses were Em
mett McDaniels, Lafe Gibson, and Dr.
Stroud. All the testimony of the de
fense's witnesses was very .hort.
About 3:30 the defendant Williams
took the stand denying in every de
tail any connectio with the hold-up.
County Attorney 'Ross cross-examined
Wi'.iiam.s very minutely as to all the
movements he and Koch made since
two days previous to the hold-up.
The case has now been on trial
'l.r-e days, and a look at the jurymen
is evidence of that fact, with their
unshaved beards and tired look. The
case may go to the jury late tonight
but it Is doubtful If a verdict will b
reached before tomorrow, if it should.
There were several women in the
court room audience, conspicious
among them being Mrs. J. II. Brandt,
whose husband' was shot by Koch.
She has followed with detail every Lit
of evidence produced in the case.
Tt.e jury in the Williams case came
in Sunday morning about nine o'clock
and reported that they had arrived at
a verdict. The clerk read the verdict
which was one of acquittal. The jury
failed to put much faith in the story
told by Koch after he had contradicted
himself a number of times.
Tr.c attention of the court yester
day was taken up in the trial of a
number of divorce cases. In the morn
ing the case of the state vs. Miguel
Alverado charged with murder, alleged
to have been committed in Bisbee sev
eral months ago will be called.

BY REVIEW
NEW YORK, April 22. Eifripments
and specialties which derive their
momentum in large part from the
war demands were the active and
strong features of today's stock mar
ket,, investment issues making little
or no progress.
Fragmentary war bulletins were en
couraging and domestic news which
included reports of increased west
ern tonnage and trade expansion, also
was helpful.
Half a score of 6tocks, among which
"lay be cited Baldwin locomotive,
Crucible steel, Bethlehem Steel, Great
Northern Ore, Mexican Petroleum and
distillers securities contributed over
whelmingly to the moderately large
business at gross advances of 1V4
to 3 points. United States Steel again
oevrtopped the list in point of activ
ity. Rails were sluggish and mostly
lower. Sales amounted to 550,000
shares. -
Time money was in smaller supply
at recent quotations but call loans
hardened. Dealings in bonds were
mainly limited to the Liberty issues,
which were varable.
Virginia deferred "s lost lO'i points
on the supreme court decision. Total
sales of bonds (par value) aggregated
35,275,000.
GRAINS
CHICAGO. April 22. Cotton devel
oped considerable strength today,
largely as a result of increasing be
lief that receipts would fall .off to a
material extent from now on. The
market closed firm at 127 and 127
May and 147 to 147 July, with
the finish as a whole ranging from a
shade off to 1 net advance. Oats
closed unchanged to cent higher
and provisions down 15' to 25 cents.
V,ienewal of talk about a prospective
diminished arrivals led to free cover
ing by shorts in corn. In the lirst
part of the day the- market w.s un
settled and bears had the advantage
a good share of the time owing to the
fact that contrary to expectation re
ceipts were fairly liberal and that the
weather here had turned fine. Bears,
however, were disappointed at the vis
ible supply statement. .which showed
a decrease of 101,000 bushels for the
week. Subsequent changes in price
were nearly all upgrade.
Fresh demand from the seaboard
gave strength to oats. Excellent crop
conditions, though, made the July de
livery incline to drag.
Provisions sagged owing to the
packers unloading and to the drop
in the value of hogs.

BETTER 'THAN CALOMEL
Thousands Have Discovered Dr.
Edwards Olive Tablets are
a Harmless Substitute.
Dr. Edwards Olive Tablets the substi
tute for calomel are a mild but sure
laxative, and their effect on the liver is
almost instantaneous. They are the result
of Dr. Edwards' determination not to treat
liver and bowel complaints with calomel.
His efforts to banish it brought out these
little olive-colored tabtets.
These pleasant little tablets do the good
that calomel does, but have no bad after
effects. They don't injure the teeth like
strong liquids or calomel. They take hold
of the trouble and quickly correct it Why
cure the liver at the expense of the teeth?
Calomel sometimes plays havoc with the
gums. So do strong liquids. It is best not
to take calomel, but to let Dr. Edwards'
Olive Tablets take its place. t
Most headaches, "dullness" and that
lazy feeling come from constipation and
a disordered liver. Take Dr. Edwards'
Oiive Tablets when you feel "bggy" and
"heavy." Note how thsy "clear" clouded
brain and how they "perk up" the spirits.

Fhe Sidling and Sting
of Blazing, Fiery Eczema
Seems Like the Skin Is on Fire.
There is a harrassing discomfort
caused by Eczema that almost be
comes a torture. The itching is al
most unbearable, and Ihe skin seems
on fire with the burning irritation.
A cure from local applications of
salves and ointments is impossible,
because such treatment can only al
lay the pain temporarily. The disease
can only be reached by going deep
down to its source.
The source of Eczema is in the
blood, the disease being caused by art
infection which breaks out through
the skin. That is why the most satis
factory treatment for all so-called
skin diseases is S. S. S., for this rem
edy so thoroughly cleanses the blood
that no impurities can remain. Cet a
bottle to-day at any drugstore, and
you will see results from the right
treatment. Write for expert medical
advice, which you can get without
cost, by addressing 5Idical Director,

reads as follows: "This hospital is
sure a lonesome place, not that there
is no one else around for I have
lots of company but this bed stuff
sure gets old. I expect to ;:o back
in about a month at the most but that
Is a long trnie to wait to get an
other crack at the flat heads. The lack
cf excitement in the hospital after
having plenty of it for so long gets
on a man's nerves. I wish that you
were able to come here; you would
enjoy part of it 1 know; you would
make a good one at the job but it
lakes two goods legs to get around
over here when things begin to hap
pen." Business Locals

CARD OF THANKS
We. desire to extend our most heart
felt thanks to our many kind friends in
Bisbee, who through their many acts
ot kindness and sympathy made the
burden in the loss of our beloved one,
Mis- Clara erger. much lighter. We
wish to especially thank the young
ladies of the Lorretto Academy, who
so kindly acted as pallbearers, and
also the members of the Knights of
Columbus, who likewise assisted. We
sincerely hope that none of them will
be te.MMi called upon to suffer such nn
irretrievable loss.
