O'Neill Measure Adopted by.
House in Night Session.
Which Closes Legislature '
Lawmakers Predict Highway!
Act Will Meet Same Fate j
as First One and Be Vetoed ;
PHOENIX, Arir. March 13. Before ,
the house had been in session 90 min-,
ntes on its night sitting, the last of j
this legislature, it had passed by aj
vote of 19 to 14 senate DM lfco, tne
majority's new highway bill, patterned
after the vetoed senate bill number
17, with the exception of the emerg
ency clause, which was dropped from
the new measure.
This bill, fathered in the upper
house by O'Neill, provides for an an
nual appropriation for two years of
$1,500,000 for highway building and
creates a highway board, consisting
bf the governor, secretary of state,
state treasurer, president of the sen
ate and speaker of tEe house, who
would name the highway commission
br whose hands would rest authority
to disburse the three million dollar
land. . '
' irr-medialely fallowing the p.v-saae
of the O'Neiil bill it wa.i freeiy pre
dicted In the corridors o: the capitol
that it would meet tha wme fate at
the goverpor's iiands as befell its pre
decessor, senate bill 17, the executive
veto. It was pointed out mat tne num-
erous criticisms of senate bill 17. em i
bodied in the governor's reto message,
still apply to bill 1&5.
Hot Battle Ends
Around the O'Neil bill and the sim
ilar one which went before it, has
raged the hottest battle of the ses
sion. Three weeks ago debate on
senate bill 17. caused the first sharp
drawing of party lines when the re
publicans accused the democratic ma
jority of attempting to strip the gov
ernor of his powers in taking the nam
ing of the highway commission out
of his hands. The democrats retorted
to the charge with the argument that
they were doing- no more than their
opponents had done under similar cir
cumstances two and four years ago.
The bill passed both houses, but
died under the governor's veto, the
executive argument hinging on two
points, first that the measure was un
constitutional in that it named two
officers of the legislature on the high
way board, and second that it sought
to take from him powers which he
claimed were delegated to him by the
people.
Following the reto. numerous con
ferences were held,. to effect a com
promise, but last night democratic
leaders asserted that nothing accept
. able had been offered and that bill
1SS, the measure which passed to
night, would be put through and sent
to the governor for his signature or
veto.
Six Bills Passed
Tbe house began its finai. session
promptly at 8 o'clock, but the senate
failed to convene till more than an
hour later, pending the result of the
committee conference on the appro
priations bill, the senate amendments
to which the house had refused to ap
prove. Meanwhile in the house half a dozen
bills had been passed. One of these,
a house bill, was the amendment to
the county seat removal act which pro
Tides that when any county seat shall
have been moved, no election may be
held for its removal again within 12
years, and when an election on the
subject of removal has been held and
the proposal has failed, no other elec
tion on the same project may be held
within one year.
The measure went to the senate.
Another bill passed, provides for the
organization of co-operative insurance !
com Dailies bv farmers. This also was ;
ent tn th nnnpr house.

Amendments to the blue sky law,
suggested by the corporation commis-
ir. or. c-iirfn that hodv a closer

through the house and were

WOffil FIGHT TO

Conductorettes Object to Dis
charge When Unionists
Threaten Strike
(By Review Leased Wire)
WASHINGTON. March 13. Argu-:iiont-
in the appeal from rh? recom
:aenda:ion of the national war labor
board that women conductors at Cleve-
lend be discharged to satisfy ie- j
mauds of. striking male employes, f
were heard today by the board. The
case was taken under advisement and i
a decision is expected witnm two
weeks.
Dr. Anna Howard Shaw, honorary
president of the national American
woman suffrage association, Frank P.
Walsh, former joint chairman of the
board, and Miss Mary Van Kleeck, di
rector of the women-in-industry service
of the labor-department, were among
those appearing in behalf of the dis
charged women workers, while James
H. Vahey, attorney for the Internation
al Amalgamated Association of Street
&. Electric Railway Employes, opposed
the appeal.
Dr. Shaw declared that during the
war that women in all parts ot the
country had responded nobly to the
nation's call for workers, but that now
that the acuteness for workers had
passed there was a tendency to "get
rid" of the women.
Mr-Walsh, whp appeared as counsel
for the women employes, said the
board should declare that women were
legally entitled to the same rights in
industry as men. The women con
ductors of Cleveland were unjustly dis
charged, he said, and should be rein
stated.
Mr Vahey urged that the board was
not legally empowered to order the re
employment of the women conductors
since its jurisdiction extenaea onij
to cases where labor disputes between
employes anA employers threatened to
result in a strike. He said the wo
men knew when they weie employed
that they would be retained only for
the period of the war.

WASHINGTON, March 23 Rednc-i
tion of SO per cent in the force ofj
the United States employment serv-j
ice effective March 22 was announced!
today by Director General Densmore. j
Thi3 was made necessary, it was ex
plained, by the. failure of Congress to
provide funds for continuance of the ,
work. Mr. Densmore said the number j
of employment offices would be re- J
duced from 750 to 56, but that none :
of the work in direct connection with :
the return of soldiers ami sailors to
civilian employment would be dis-j
continued.

Densmore. "'The special work in

Emergency Fund Gone
Secretary Wilson, In a statement
tonight explaining the plan for re
taining a skeleton organization of the
service, disclosed that the service
could not draw on President Wilson's
5100,000,000 war emergency fund be
cause practically all of it has been
spent or pledged.
After the urgency deficiency bill
was killed Iff the filibuster in the clos
ing hours of the last session of the
Senate, Secretary Wilson appealed to
the President. He received thi3 re
ply by radio from the presidential
j ship. George Washington at sea:
continuance of the work of the em-
ployment service bureau, but the fact
is that Including pledges made, my
fund is practically exhausted. What
remains would not suffice to ninin-
tair the bureau, and to my great
grief I see no escape from disband-
ment. I hope that it will be possuie
to keep a skeleton organization."

"The Army. Navy and Shipping
Board have arranged to put the Rail
road Administration wage scale .nd
working conditions into effect and ne
gotiations are progressing favorably
toward complete and satisfactory set
tlement which wili restore normal
conditions and serve the interest of

Officials of the Government deTva.-t-ments
interested decline to confirm
reports that' they are planning to

The difficulty in obtaining coal for
Army and" Navy shps was solved
.vhen representatives of both branches
of the service chartered 12 boats
from a private firm to carry coal to
these vessels. Union men agreed to!
operate the boats on condition that!
they were used solely for Govern
ment work. Secretary of the Navy
Daniels today directed Rear Admiral
Usher, commandant of the Third Na
tal District, not to allow the use of
Navy tugs to tow coal barges for pri
vate firms. This was in answer to
an appeal by Fred Hedley, general
manager of the Interborough Rapid
Transit Company, that Naval tuss be
permitted to tow the barges of two
private firms engaged in supplying
the company with fuel.

tion. Senator Reed announced that a
statement outlining, the purposes of
the organization would be issued with
in a lew days. One purpose, it was
explained, would be the co-ordination

PARIS, March 13. Louis Klotz. the
inance minister. In his eagerly await
i speech In the chamber Of deputies
tday on the financial situation, an
nunced that the yearly budget woula
three or four times greater than
fce&re the war, the deficit to meet be
ing ?1,7 5 0,000,000 francs. V
M. Klotz gave some striking figures
of 'r expenditures. He said: that
more than 39.000,000.000 francs -was
spent tor artillery and 11,000.0004)00
francifor the pay of troops. The , to
tal exj?nditures of the ministry of ar
ere 119.000,000,000 francs (about
J22.000JOO.OOO) while the navy depart
ment sient only 6,000.000,000 francs.
Acconing to M. Klotz It -would be
relativelr easy to meet the 1919 de
ficit by m increase In direct taxes,
an incomi tax, receipts from the liqui
dation of war stores and a revision o
the law verning the transportation
of troops ' over French railways by
charging tie allies for transportation,
as the Freich are charged. The rail
road deficit the minister said, would
be 4,000,00000 francs.
Concerning the proposed tax on
capital M. Notz said the French cap
italist tax ptyer would not be called
on to pay on cent of additional taxes
until Germany's indemnity figures to
France were settled upon and guar
anteed. But cen should Germany pay
completely for damages and the re
storation of Tht devastated provinces,
31. Klotz said this would not balance
future budgets after 1919. The tax on
capital, the mfalster asserted, was
destined to reach war profiteers.
M. Klotz did not heed numerous
Interpellations frtm all sides of the
chamber asking him to name the
amount which would be demanded
from Germany. Victor Dalbien, radi
cal socialist, created some excitement
by shouting:
"Long live Caillaux. referring to
former Premier Josiph Caillaux. who
is under arrest charged with having
had dealings with the enemy. The
chamber was filled with officers and
soldiers, who loudly hissed Dalbien.
One officer shook his fist at the dep
uty and shouted a challenge to & duel.
M. Klotz during his address men
tioned a future financial society of na
tions, the plans of which have been
discussed and will be given out short
ly as the only means for France to
balance future budgets. He also spoke
of additional taxes after Germany's
war Indemnity has been deducted from
the present French debt.

WASHINGTON. March 13 The
Mexican congress has been called by
President Carranza to meet in extra
session May 1. State department ad
vices today said business to be con
sidered would Include oil land legis
lation, a law to enforce provisions of
the new constitution relating to labor
and social welfare and legislation for
a central bank.
The oil land legislation is of marked
Interest to the United States. Great
Britain and France, as it will affect
vast property holdings of their na
tionals. The pending petroleum bill,
upon which the last eongress did not
have time to act after the measure
was submitted by President Carran
za. Is regarded in official circles here
are unsatisfactory in that it merely
grants licenses to oil companies to
operate their productive wells and
thus fails to insure title to their un
developed lands held in reserve for
tie future.
Officials said today the proposed
law failed to recognize vested rights
which the United States, Great Brit
ain and France specifically insisted
upon In notes sent to the Mexican
government nearly a year ago. The
rights of property purchased in Mex
ico under the old constitution were
recognized until 19J7 when the new
constitution declaring all minerals be
longed to the government and denying
the right df foreigners to own land in
Mexico became effective.
Some high officials believe that be
cause of the new feeling of coopera
tion now evident on both sides of the
Rio Grande the objectionable feature
of the oil bill will be eliminated by
the Mexican congress.
The labor legislation to come be
fore the extra session of congress also
is considered of great importance be
cause it affects many mining, agri
cultural and other companies in Mex
ico financed by Americans and other
foreigners. Under authority of the
new constitution many of the Mexi
can states have adopted the eight
hour day, with a seven-hour limit for
night work, compulsory profit sharing
among the employes and other labor
aws and a means is now sought to
enforce them.
Workmen's compensation laws
have been enacted by most of the
state legislatures.

New Attempt Looked for
at Convention
(By Review Leased Wir)
WASHINGTON, March 13. Efforts j
to add four members to the republican j
steering committee of the next house,
which in directing the general course
of legislation in the next congress is
regarded by leaders as Influencing
the party platform of 1920, were de
feated today at the final meeting of
the committee on committees which
framed the house organization. The
proposal was voted down, 155 to 36,
but it wa3 said an attempt might be
made to reject the committee's action
at the party conference which will be
held just before congress re-convenes.
After the action of the committee.
Representatives Longworth of Ohio
and Johnson of South Dakota, issued !
protests, the Ohio member charging I
that the net result of all the work of
the committee was "the most com
plete sort of a triumph for reaction
ism, and the South Dakota represen
tative declaring that the failure to in
crease the membetrship of the steer
ing committee, "was a serious mis
take. Both intimated they would car
ry the fight to the party confer
ence. Representative Johnson had nomi
nated as additional members Repre
sentatives Anderson of Minnesota; No
lan. California; Slemp, Virginia, and
Reavis. Nebraska, and said that such
action "would secure representation of
the progressive sentiment of the
west," and also give labor a voice on
the committee. His motion was op
posed by Representatives Moore of
Pennsylvania; Mann, Illinois, and
Mondell, Wyoming; who said the com
mittee on committees was limited to
the selection of five men and that the
west had been fair representation
throughout the house organization.
The 36 votes in favor of the increase
were cast for the republican repre
senattives from Ohio. Massachusetts.
West Virginia, Maryland and South
Xakota. while the 155 opposing votes
were casi oy me vv isconsui, ew
York. Pennsylvania, Illinois. Idaho,
Iowa. Oregon. California. Kentucky,
Michigan. Wyoming, Indiana. Montana.
Rhode Island. Colorado. Minnesota,
New Hampshire and North Dakota
delegations.
At today's meeting final approval
was given the assignment of members
of the standing house ctomnraees.
Mr. Maun was selected as the chair
man of the committee en woman suf
frage. He announced later he would
introduce the Susan B. Anthony
amendment in the next house "on the
first day it meets." and would urge
i speedy adoption. Republican metnber
1 ohip of the suffrage committee, as r
! lecteu today, showed a majority in fa-
for cf the amendment. The republi
cans placed on the committee were:
i Repientatives Little, Kansas; El
iliott. Indiana; Nolan. California; Bur
j roughs. New Hampshire; Nelson. Wis
: censin, and McCray. New York,
i Shipping Committee
j The Republican membership of Ihe
j merchant marine committee, which
will hava phflrpp rf th lpislatmn
dealing with the policy for operating
the American fleet, also was selected
today, the new members being Rep
resentative Curry, California; Rick
etts, Ohio; Chindbloom, Illinois;
Crowther. New York; Randalt Wis
consin, and Andrews. Maryland.
Representative Johnspn, in . his
statement, said he believed the com
mittee had been fair in its selection
of men of the standing House com
mittees. He, however, attacked its
action in refusing to increase the
steering committee, saying that with
Representative Fordney of Michigan
heading the House ways and means
committee and Senator Penrose of
Pennsylvania, the Senate finance
committee, "we should have the most
progressive steering committee in the
House that we could secure. The lib
eral sentiment of the country, he
added, should control the steering
committee because it "is the legisla
tive committee of the House," and
"on the legislative record, we win or
lose In 1920."
Longworth's Statement
Representative Longworth, in his
statement, said the result cf Ihe
committee's work "was to make James
R. Mann the dominating figure of
! the next House."
I "If it had been deliberately planned
to restore the conditions existing ;n
i the House 10 years ago.'" declared his
j statement, "as a result of which the
Republican majority became a mi
! nority, tha plan could nothave been
! more successfully consummated. -
j After comparing the" personnel of
1 the House leadership of 10 years ago
luith thut of the next Congress, Mr.
i Longworth attacked Mann's record
l during the war Congress, adding thai
! Republicans throughout the country
! "if they want some other leader then
i let them instruct their representatives
' to see to it that at least control of
the House organization he placed in
! the hai:d of men who have stood
straight on preparedness and on war
.measures and who believe that- the
i Republican rarty has progressed since

WASHINGTON. March 13. Al
though operating expenses of the rail
roads of the country showed a de
crease in January, gross and net op
erating revenues continued to de
crease, the net revenue, after deduc
tion of taxes, falling about $54,000,000
6hort of the Government's average
monthly rental obligation of approx-J
imately 575.000.000. . !
A summary of revenues and. ex-
penses for 1S1 roads with annual iv-,
enue in excess of $1,000,000 made pub-!
He today by the Interstate Commerce
Commission, showed that gross- ope
rating revenues in January declined
more than $43,000,00". or about 10.5
per cent, from the December figure
of J440.100.165. Net operating reve-
nue fell off 5S.744.SS2. or 5.1 per cent
from the December total of $45,065,603 i
while operating expenses " were $360;-1
465,815, a decrease of $34,568,747.
Deduction of taxes and uncollect-;
able revenues from net operating rev

year before, gross operating revenues
for January increased $111..427.0i0 or

Our Old Young Men
That our bodies begin wearing
startling belief of Dr. Eugene Lyman
Methuselah
did it, why
can't we do
as well?
Why do men and women begin to grow old when they are little
more than half -matured?
Ycu cannot answer that question, for no two experts agree on why
the death rate of young people has been reduced in the past thirty years
while that of people over 25 has increased.
Cnnsi.ler two new-born ' babies, eoual in health. At 40, one is .
still a youth. The oiher is a broken man if still alive.
Two generations ago nearly all men past 70 wore long beards,
carried staffs and hugged the grocery store stove. Grandpa "now does
war work and grandma dances and wears short skirts. But camouflage
cannot halt the Grim Reaper nor do years register the wearing out of
the body.
There are 6690 people in America over 90 years of age and 3SS
who have passed the century mark. They are the rare exceptions.
By lowering the death rate among young folks we have increased
the average length of life. We have also shortened the average num
ber of years still coming for those who have passed 23.
. The Rubner school of physiologists believe that death is a natural
happening like the fali of winter leaves in autumn. From the obser
vations of Dr. Fisk, our leaves are withering and falling dead! in the
summer of life.
Of men between 21 and 31 called up under the. draft, 3S per cent
were turned' down on account of physical defects. Old age has already
sunk its talons into 38 out of every 100 of our manhood.
The doctors figured that more than HALF OF THESE PHYSICAL
DEFECTIVES WERE THE DIRECT RESULT OF CARELESSNESS,
ignorance and lack of physical training in youth.
How can we check this increasing tendency of people to die after
they are 25?
The late Professor Metchnikoff. the buttermilk champion, led the
scientists who believe we could all live to be 150 by correct eating.
Metchnikoff died at 71.
Old age is more than a problem of buttermilk, bran bread and
gymnasiums. ITS GANGSTERS ARE WORRY. OVERWORK. NERV
OUS STRAIN, DISSIPATION AND OCCUPATIONAL POISONS. ,
AIcohclic dissipation is itself ready fcr the undertaker. All the
other partners of death, are in our social system. That means they
can be fought conquered.
Better working conditions and a co-operative backing of each in
dividual that will eliminate the poison of worry and fear, from the big
antidote for the increasing menace of death.
And if old age generally begins at 12. the quicker we rid this world
of child labor and give ail city children places to play and exercise, just
that much sooner can we shove old age aside until it does not begin
until 15 later 20 and finally, when we get our industrial world near
perfection, no one will break down until old age comes naturally, as the
Creator intended.
We cannot all be like Numas . de Cagna. a native of Bengal, the
oldest man in recorded history, who died in 1556 at the age of 370, but
we can at least give tais generation of youngsters and the ones to
follow a fighting chance. '.-.--
The Sober, Second Thought
We imagine that the democracy of Vice-President Marshall is as
eld fashioned as he declared in his address before the legislature, his
religion to be. , the old time Presbyterianism. The vice president ve
infer has never been carried away- by political reforms and has not
been therefore subjected to the hardships of the return journey which
many democrats are now enduring.
The begira of the democrats of Arizona some nine years ago along
the trail of socialism and which some have lately thought was bolshe
vism, was a rather general movement. Nine-tenths of the democrats of
the baby state took part in it and the few who did not join in the declara
tion that the "peepul" were infallible were rejected as unfit to hold
office. It was a stampede. We were led" by demagogues in whom we
foolishly believed.
It has since been realized that the people and a very large majority
of them had made a mistake and those of the democratic leaders who
first recovered sanity and had the courage to do so, turned back. They
were called reactionaries.
Now, a word about reactionaries. They are not always and wholly
bad. There, for instance, was the farmer who yoked himself with a calf
to a cart. When his team-mate began running away, he pulled back.
He endeavored to retard progress and so became a reactionary, made
so by a sober second-thought. The democratic leaders kept coming
back in larger and' larger numbers and some of theni 'are shamefacedly
denying that they were ever in the stampede at all. They declare not
very loudly though that they never had very much faith in the wisdom
of the masses, and in a whisper they confide that they always believed
that popular rule and cur god-given constitution were babblings of our
babyhcod. and now that Arizona is approaching maturity it Is time to
put away childLoh things.
Th eptople, it is true, luuot ultimately rule under our system of
government but a system which allows and encourages people to go off at
half-Cock is neither a good nor'a safe system. It wC'De, all right some
time, and it is letter than it was. The people are adjusting themselves
to it. In the earlier elections we adopted many wild and radical meas
ures. Te wilder and more radical, the bigger the majorities for them
The Ltwtr rid uatried, the more progressive we" thought they were.
But in the last to elections there was a change. The voters had
become, if 'not more discriminating, at least; more cautious and pro
posed freakish legislation has almost uniformly been defeated.
The voters haiV shown sotnetuing of that "sober second-thought" of
which the vice president spoke, whose expression alone tnaye be called
the voice of God. -
There is something more in the rule of the people than the popular
making of laws. When a people or a majority of the people have learned
to rule themselves, to restrain themselves, they have begun to demon
strate seme capacity for self-government.
Any people, however ignorant and vicious, can make laws and do
make them. Russia, for. instance, abounds in new and untried laws.
There are perhaps no bu.-iner and more fertile law makers anywhere
than the bolshevists. But no man is fit to participate in the government
cf his fellows unless he capable of governing himself. Arizona Re

HOUSE, FACING NIGHT
SESSION, GRINDS OUT
MANY NEW MEASURES
General Highway Legislation
Dodged as Lesser Bills
Are Acted Upon
By Review Leased Wire)
PHOENIX. Ariz, March 13. Facing
a night session, possibly an all-night
one, the fourth legislature on its last
day ground out with dreary monotony
bill after bill without touching on the
contentious subject which still re
mained unsettled, general highway leg
islation. The final battle on this pre
sumably was postponed till the ground
had been cleared of at least some of
the litter which had accumulated from
a total of 400 bills introduced during
the past 60 days.
As fast as the list of measures for
third reading dwindled, the sifting
committee provided more material in
lots of a dozen or so at a time.
In the house the senate bill to curb
usurious charges by pawnbrokers,
which has lain at the bottom of the
heap for weeks ever since it was fa
vorably reported from the banking
committee, was brought to light and
i passed to be sent to the governor.
Cadet Bill Passed
Galbraith asked for second consid
eration of the senate high school cadet
bill, which provides an appropriation
for military training in schools. This
was beaten the ether day, but again
was brought forward today and this
time it passed.
The senate bill carrying an appro
priation of $50,000 for an electrical
power plant at the Florence state pris
on raised some opposition, but not
enough to kill it, and it carried.
False impersonation and fraud.
which come under the provisions of
another senate bill, also were dealt
with harshly by the house and this
measure was sent to the governor for
his signature.
An echo of Colter's candidacy in the
last gubernatorial race is found in sen
ate bill 123 which passed the house
and was sent to the executive for sig
nature. This provides for an amend
ment to- the constitution which now
bars a member of the legislature from
seeking office involving a salary in
crease, a provision which was brought
against Colter in his recent race.
New Election Rule
The new bill would bar a member
only from an office whose term' com
mences while he is a member, or from
a salary increase starting within his
term as a member of the legislature.
Before senate bill 141 was passed in
the house Eddy explained that it pro
vided in second class counties for an
increase of the school superintendent's
salary from ?2000 to $2400 and the sal
ary of the supervisors secretary from
5150 a month to $175 a month.
An explanation also was offered for
house bill 1S4, re-establishing the pro
cedure in the death penalty. Galbraith
said that the procedure had not been
reviewed with recent legislation re
storing the death penalty in the state
and thit the present bill was intro
duced to make the penalty operative.
The measure carried.
The two house bills advanced during
the latter hours of the session to con
trol notaries public and their work,
both went through. One bars notaries
from acting after theor touimissiou
have expired and the other legalizes
instruments so acknowledged over
which there is no litigation pending.
Expenses totaling 52775 for the agri
cultural and horticultural were ap
proved and sent to the senate.
The house also passed Henry C.
White's bill of $950. balance due him
as former teacher of the deaf and
dumb at the University of Arizona.
A measure to encourage vocational
education was another house measure
which was carried and sent to the sen
ate. WOULDN'T TAKE A

Superior-Miami
Road Is Voted
Little's Protest That Fund
Too Small Fails to Halt
Action
isi
lEv Review Leased Wire)
PHOENIX, Ariz, March 13.
One hundred thousand dollars for
the Superior-Miami highway was
voted by the house today over
Little's protest that such an
amount would not build three
miles of that 15-mile canyon route.
Little, however, was almost alone
in his opposition to the measure.
The concensus of opinion seemed
to be that the object was a worthy
cne.
Dr. Lacy said it would give Mi
ami a much needed western outlet
and that the canyon through
which the road would run was sec
ond in scenic beauty only to the
Grand canyon of the Colorado.
The bill was sent to the gover
nor for his signature.
Another senate road bill which
went through was that to allow
county supervisors on their own
initiative to call bond elections
for highway building. This aiso is
in the governor's hands.

owners of the Salt river vallev.
While the house approves of licens-j
mg osieopatns. tne senate dees not.
and the bill to license the profession,
which passed the lower body, was kill
ed by th senate. Earlier in the ses
sion a bill to license ehiropracties also
was voted down.
Study of the Bible in public schools
for its historical and literary value,
is permitted in the house bill which
the senate passed and sent to the gov
ernor. Sectarian study and examina
tions are strictly banned.
Game Laws Amended
False advertising in Arizona is to be
visited by quick punishment, if the
governor signs the bill which went
j through the hcuse and received the
senate s approval today.
Game or fish killed or taken oui
of season will be expensive, according
j to another measure which was sent
ine cmeI executive. It provides
penalties irom ?joo tor em to i ror
fish.
A. new method of collecting motor
licenses is provided in a house mea
sure which the upper chamber passed.
Full payment will not be demanded
for licenses taken out after a portion
of the year elapsed.
Another bill which finally went
through the legislature was one to pro
vide for alternatives for justices of the
peace when ill or absent.

BY REVIEW
NEW YORK, March 13. Reaction-
arv tendencies were uppermost dur-
! jjjg the greater part of today's lively
stock market, nnees breaking sn&rp-,
Iv at times in those Issues which re-
cently were the objects of bullish at-
tention. I
In place of the public interest man-
ifest at intervals ekrlier in the week.
there were indications of more extcn-
sive realizing sales under cover cf
feverish activity in a few of the high
priced specialties. t;
The one outstanding feature was
furnished by Industrial Alcohol, which
next to United States Steel, was the
I most active issue of the day, at an
extreme advance of 15 points.
United States Steel fluctuated with
in a radius of almost two points but
was under constant pressure, closing
at a fractional loss, but related in
dustrials and equipments, also leath
ers, tobaccos, some of the oils and
efrtilizers were firm to strong. Sales
amounted to 1,135.000 shares.
Trading in bonds was a trifle broad-
er and iina in the main, although
Liberty issues were irregular, and An-
glo-French 5's yielded a triile. Total
sa:es, per vaiue. aggregating $11,230.-
000. Old United States bonds were
unchanged on cail.
GRAIN MARKET
CHICAGO, March 13. Corn plunged
heavi.y aownward in price today
owing in the main to 'word that tne
Government proposed to take stern
action against any attempt to hora
iood siuas. Tne market closed weak,
4c to 4tc net lower, with May $1.36
to ?l.S6Vi and July $1.318 to $1.31.
Oats lost IVic to 2V;c and provisions
fr tn 1
Waves of selling in the corn mar-'
ket clearly indicated that the semi-
mopt nf th tmrfp had nnrtprrnne al-
most a complete reversal overnight'0 R-eed
Oats broke in sympathy with corn.
Maximum declines took place in pro
visions. Packers were said to be on
the seilnig side, and there was men
tion of ditfcuity in obtaining vessel
room for exports.
METAL- MARKET
NEW YORK. March 13. Lead un
changed, spelter, unchanged; spot,
East St. Louis, delivery blank. Cop
per dull, electrolytic, 1415.
