BARES GOVERNOR'S
CHECKERED RECORD
IfJ FRANK ADDRESS
Refutes Infamous Insults and
Outrageous Slander in Mes
sage to Legislature; Ad'
dress Goes on Journal.
(Special to The Reviews
FHOENIX, Ariz., June 4. That this
is a war session of the legislature was
demonstrated in truth today.
In the senate" Governor Hunt's refer
ence to the Bisbee deportations and
the governor's political characteristics
were denounced in a great speech by
Senator Fred Sutter, of Bisbee, and
thereafter Sutter's utterances were or
dered spread on the journal and print
ed. In the house was read a letter ad
dressed to the governor by Norman E.
Carmichael, general manager of the
Arizona Copper company, of Clifton,
also of a nature complimentary to tha
executive, though it was only filed, the
speaker ruling it not within the pur
view of the session.
A bill which would have given Form
er Governor Thomas E. Campbell sal
ary for the time he was in office failed,
though a majority of the members in
the house voted for the measure which
required a two-thirds vote.
Sutter Gave Warning
Prior notice of Sutter's intentions to
address the Senate on the governor's
references, had been given. The gal
leries were crowded, largely with capi
tol officials and employes, from whota
came applause for the remarks in re
buttal. There was such marked ap
proval of the speaker's words that the
president threatened a clearance of
spectators. The house adjourned and
came over in a body.
Senator Suttor's address, in full,
follows:
"Mr. President: i
"I rise to speak to a question of per
sonal privilege. I rise, sir, for the.
purpose of correcting some misstate
ments and refuting false charges con
tained in the message of the governor
addressed to this honorable body. I
feel lhat I would be recreant to my
duty as a resident of the city of Bis
bee were I to remain silent and per
mit to go unchallenged the infamous
insults and outrageous slanders con
tained in that message towards the
citizens of my community and which
I infer were given a place in that doc
ument for the purpose of misleading
the public and poisoning the minds of
men who might hereafter sit as jurors
in passing on the guilt or Innocence
of men charged with the commission
of a public offense.
Excuse for Message
"No other excuse can be found fori
reference in that message to the Bis-
bee deportations, unless It be that the
chief executive of this great state de
sired to take advantage of the oc
casion to indicate to the public
mind that while he could find no lan-

To Enroll Five Million Youths
In American War Class of 1918
WASHINGTON. June 4 MachineYyfor the registration tomorrow of
! nearly a million youths who have reached zi years ot age since June i.
last, is completed, according to Provost General Crowder today, address
) ing a message to the 1918 class of registrants.
General Crowder's message reads:
i "On the 5th of June, 1917, just one year ago tomorrow, occurred one
i cf the most memorable events in the history of democratic institutions.
"On that day ten million self-governed young Americans marched
i quietly to the polls, and, in a voice that was heard around the world, reg-
istered their invincible determination to preserve for themselves and
? posterity the blessings of the liberty with which they have been so richly
endowed.
J "A year has passed. Many of these men are now on the battlefields
J of France and on tomorrow, the 5th of June, that voice will have found
j its echo when one million more will rally to their support. '
The nation is engaged in a struggle for its existence. Our activities
! have been diverted from the normal peace-time channels and the energy
! of these who remained at home is being directed mora closely every day
j toward the accomplishment of the things upon which our armies must
depend, ar.d without which success is impossible.
"Every American must do his duty in this great crisis, even though
! he remains at home. Those who are of su(h an age and condition in life
! that they may, without detriment to the economic support of the army,
actively oppose themselves against our enemy on the European battle
j fields, are indeed privileged
"Most of the men who register tomorrow will be so classified and I
i have no hesitancy in predicting that their services will win for them the
J undying affection of a proud and grateful nation."
II S. MAY PREVENT
TELEGRAPH STRIKE
fBy Review leased Wire)
WASHINGTON, June 4,--Only in
tervention by the federal government
can prevent a general strike of oper
ators employed by the Western Union
and Postal Telegraph companies, S.
J. Konenkamp, president of the tele
graphers' union said tonight before
leaving for Chicag Upon his arrival
there he planned to mail out the call
for a walk out as result of the refusal
of the Western Union to submit to the
jurisdiction of the national war labor
board which sought to compose differ
ences between the companies and the
men.
After two days spent here in discuss
ing the situation with administration
officials, members of congress and la
bor leaders, Mr. Kqnenkanip said he
doubted that, even should the govern
ment decide to intervene, action could
be taken in time to prevent the men
from going out. He declined to esti
mate the number that might be in
volved. Secretary Wilson, who discussed the
situation with the union president, is
understod to have laid the matter be
fore the cabinet at its meeting oday
bu there was no indicaion that further
steps were planned to prevent a strike.
Mr. Koenkamp said be had been as
sured by President Gompers, of the

assistance as the federation could lend

YANKEES REPULSE
PRUSSIAN DRIVES
(By Review Teased Wire)
WITH THE AMERICAN ARMY IN
PICARDY, June 4 (By The Associated
Press). American troops cocperati?ig
witn the French west of Ciiauteau
Thierry, north of the Marne, the near
est and most critical point to Paris
reached by the enemy, have brilliant
ly chiftked the on-rushing Germans,
beaten or repeated attacks and in
flicted severe losses, adding to the
glory of the American history.
The troops began to arrive on the
battle front on Saturday and took part
in the fighting almost immediately.
They not only repulsed the Germans
at every point at which they were
engaged, but took prisoners, without
having any prisoners in turn taken by
the Germans.
Eager For Battle
The American troops entered the
battle enthusiastically, eager to fight,
after a long march. On their to
the battle line, they were cheered by
the crowds in the villages throueh
which they passed. Their victorious !
stand, with their gallant French allies I
so soon after entering the line has J
electrified all France.
The work of the American machine I
gunners was particularly noteworthy, i
There was at least one instance where .
an entire attacking party was wipel '.
out.
Owing to the firceness of the bat-,
tie. it has been difficult to verify de
tails but there are instances of the
stiffest of hand to hand fighting. In
this, the Americans acquitted tliem-J
selves in a manner which won the!
gieatest praise from their French
comrades. The most determined at
tack against the Americans occurred
last night. Preceded by a heavy boni-'
bardment, the Germans came in
waves. They penetrated the American
trenches, but were quickly ejected,
leaving many desd.
Two earlier attacks Monday .ind
three Sunday had the same result.
DEFEND CHATEAU THIERRY
WITH THE AMERICAN ARMY ON
THE MARNE. Monday. June 3 (By

machine gunners only an hour or so
after their arrival on the banks of
the river Marne on the 31st of May
took a most active part in the defense
of Chateau Thierry which then was
menaced with imminent capture by
the Germans.
GERMAN DRIVE HALTED

here that for the present at least.
General Foch has fought the enemy to
a standstill without the loss of any
point of stragetic value and without
serious inroads on his reserves.

area between Soissc.ns ?ad C'haitau

Although in these attacks the enemy
still is using large effectives and great
numbers of guns, he is being held al
most everywhere from Turther prog

pelled to assume the defensive against
vicious blows delivered by the Amer

Americans Show Valor
The Americans hi the sectors where
they are alone or brigaded with allied
tioop3 everywhere are fighting with a
siirit of abandon that places them
rightly in the category of veterans.
Near the Neiuilly Wood which lies
northwest of Chateau Thierry and -it
the point where the drive has brought
the enemy nearest Paris, the Amer
icans have beaten off.a strong German
attack, and on the Marne nt Jaul;on
ne, some six miles northeast of Cha

shoulder with the French, they have
aided in forcing the first contingent of
the enemy to cross the Marne again
to seek refuge on the northern hank

Clinging to Bodies.
(By Review Leased Wire)
LEWES. Del., June 4. Nineteen
survivors, passengers and crew of the
steamship Carolina, were landed here
today and brought a harrowing tale
of the sea, the news of the loss of six
teen of their number and a remarkable
rescue of a girl while they drifted
helpless on the ocean during a severe
thunderstorm Sunday night.
Ten boats left the Carolina before
she was sunk by the German subma
rine U-37, all passed through the same
storm and the sun-Ivors here said
they had felt sure all were lost. They
expressed great joy when informed
that most of the Carolina's company
had been saved.
The nineteen persons landed here
were brought in by a British vessel
that picked them up more than 23
miles off the Delaware capes. None of
them had any knowledge that th?
submarine had shelled the life boats.
U-Boat Warning Issued
The story of the survivors did not
become public until they were takdi
to the railroad station late this after
noon and left for New York. One of
their number, however, was detained.
He is a German member of the crew
and will be held pending investigation.
According to the survivors, the Caro
lina was warned late Sunday after
noon by wireless to look out for sub
marines. The steamer was advised
that a three masted schooner had Just
been sunk and was cautioned not to
show lights. At 6 o'clock Sunday eve
ning a submarine appeared above the
surface close to the Carolina. She
was about 350 feet long, survivors
said, and was identified as the U-37.
"A German officer with an armed
guard came along side and gave or
ders to our captain to lower all boats
and leave the ship in twenty minutes."
said one of the survivors. "Of course,
it would be useless to say that none
of us was frightened. Good order was
maintained, however. The sea was
smooth and there appeared to be few
elements of danger. Nobody thought
of a storm and the German officers ap
peared to show consideration to the
passengers as they hurried to leave
the steamer.
Return for Fireman
"Ten boats were lowered and every
body got in. There was little or no
toni'usion. Ail the time the submarine
lay as close as possible, her crew
standing on her deck watching us.
After the life boats had swung. away
from the Carolina, the Cerman officer
ordered one to return. This frightened
many in other life boats but alter a
time we found out the reason for
action. In going through tiie steamer
he found a fireman who had be;p left
behind and he had ordered the life
boat to return for him.
"When this last boat was clear of
the ship again the Germans left the
Carolina and in a few minutes the
submarine shelled her seven times.
Then she burst into flames.
"It was a beautiful Sunday even'ng.
The sun began to set as the Carolina
slowly went down. Then it got dart

the time they were at sea. None was
in a serious condition, however.
Women Faint
Some of the women were attired in
rough blue overalls and jumpers bor
rowed from the crew. The hair,
streaked across their faces, was palst
ered down by the mixture of salt and
water used in an effort to revive them
when they fainted. One woman faint
ed as a life guard lifted her from the
yawl and ran to the tent with her. At
that moment the notes of the Star
Spangled banner floated into the tent
and the woman, half-raising on her cot,
cried hysterically, "We're safe. Safe

New York City, 3.000 miles from the

for possible air raids with a grain of
humor, laughing and cheering as po

"With the coming of daylight the
sea calmed. All hands came to the
conclusion that all iu the other boits
had perished. After a while an ob
ject was seen in the water. There
was no way to reach it as the launch
had lost her gasoline and oars. Ths
launch, however, drifted close and the
survivors were startled to discover a
Mil alive clinging to the bodies of
two drowned men. The bodies wore
incased in life belts but the girl wore
none. She appeared to be a good
swimmer and with herow n efforts and
clinging to the two bodies for support
she managed to remain afloat. The
launch got near enough to her to ef
lect her rescue and she proved to be

was picked up by the British vessel."
All the passengers and crew
suffered from exhaustion but wuro
well on the way to recovery when they
left for New York.
The two women brought ashore
wore little clothing and they were
supplied by the women of Lewes.
Some confusion developed late to
night as to the number of persons lost
when the boat carrying survivors from
the Carolina capsized. It is possible,
it was said, that survivors who re
ported that sixteen had been drowned
may have been mistaken. One report
late tonight said that only seven per

AMERICANS PRAISED
WITH THE FRENCH ARMY ON
THE MARNE. (By the Associated
Press). Scarcely had the Americans
alighted from their motor cars when
they were ordered into Chateau Thi
erry with a battalion of French colon
ial troops. The Americans immedi
ately organized their defenses and by
rapid action and excellent shooting
caused the approaching enemy to hes
itate. In order to mask their movements
the Germans used smoke grenades,
rendering shooting difficult for the de
fenders, and at the same tin; opened
a severe bombardment on the town.
The enemy started across the bridge
but when they had reached the cen
ter of the structure a terrific explos
ion behind them heralded the de
struction of the central arch. Dozens
of the Germans were hurled into the
water, while the few that reached the
south side were captured.
The Americans who held the south
end of the bridge and banks of the
river covered the whole operation and
protected the french troops white
crossing before the explosion. The
French officers fighting with them de
clare that the Americans displayed
wonderful qualities of coolness and
courage in the most difficult situation,
and in the course of the trying strug
gle in the streets, while afterward
they, with their machine guns, prevent
ed all attempts of the enemy, to re
pair the bnage.
Yankees gave on their arrival in this !
zone to absorb quickly the newest in
fighting tactics has been made good."
said a British officer to the corre
spondent today. "A good proportion
of them appear fit now, and many
more will soon follow."
The British instructors are partic
ularly pleased with the markmanship
of their American allies. In rifle prac
tice some of the units have given sur
prisingly high averages. The British
consider them good also with bayonets
and quick firers.

GERMAN ADVANCE ENDS
LONDON7, May 4. The military cor
respondent of the British wireless ser
vice writes:
"Between the rivers Aisne and
Marne while fighting continues all
along the line, the operations may al
most be said to have ceased to be a
German advance and to have subsided j
into fights for local positions. Thus, !
while the enemy claims to have taken !
Cbaudun and the heights to the wast f
of Chateau Thierry, the French have
retaken the village of Faverolles and
the Mont De Choissy. But except on
a large scale map the change in the
line is scarcely preemptible.
"On the rest of the new ground
there have been no changes except for
the operation by which the British ad
vanced their line locally at Thiellois,
to the southwest of Rheims. The mo
ment has evidently arrived when the
crown prince's army must appreciate

never fails. Touch any corn or callus
with two drops of "Gets-It," and "Gets
It" does the rest. It's a relief to be
able to stop cutting corns, making j
them bleed, wrapping them up like i
packages and using sticky tape and '
salves. It removes any corn clear and ;
clean, leaving the toe as smooth as i
your palm. You can wear those new
shoes without pain, dance and be I
frisky on your feet. It's great to use
"Gets-It."
"Gets-It" is sold at all druggists

a bottle), or sent on receipt of price

PACIFIC CITIES TO
POUR OUT VESSELS
SAN FRANCISCO, Cal., June 4. j
The Pacific Coast stands ready to j
j pour out concrete ships as fast as j
1 they are needed according to the en-
glneers who constructed the big con-1
crete steamer "Faith" here recently, j
The design for the next boat, bigger I
than the Kaitii by 2500 tons, dead ,
cargo weight, is completed. It will ;
be followed by three more of the ;
same design, according to the rngi-1
neers. i
All of the boats will be built on the j
big flat in Redwood City, near here, i
where the Faith was given to the
waves, but other plants are likely to
spring up anywhere, it is alleged,
since no elaborate shipyard is needed.
As soon as the Faith has been giv
en her trial spin on San Francisco
bay, moulds will be set for the next
boat, and if the steel is rushed and
other materials are available, she will
fee turned out in less than three
months fully equipped and ready for
sea, the Faith's builders said.
The Faith has a carrying capacity
of 5.000 tons and will be used in the
coastwise and trans-Pacific trade, ac
cording to present plans. The new
vessels will have 7,500 tons cargo
capacity, will each be 100 feet longer
than the Faith, and 13 feet wider, and
should make ten knots or better.
There will be other departures in
the new vessels. They will not have
the flat bottom of the Faith or the
same squat lines. They will carry a
gun fore and aft for use against sub
marines if used in the Atlantic war
zones. Their engines will be set
amidships, instead of in the stern, as
is the case with the Faith.
The ways down which the Faith
slid will be abandoned, according to
the engineers, and a new set of ways
will be constructed for the new ves
sels. All designs for the new vessels are
being submitted to the United States
Shipping Board, according to the en
gineers. The Board will have experts
"on the job" and a naval construction
expert Ls on band already to advise
with and receive advice from the
builders.
"To show how fast we can build."
one of the Faith's engineers said, "the
workers who were buildlixthe Faith
consistently ran ahead of the plans
we were making for that vessel. In
stead of having the vessel follow the
plans, we were forced to some extent
to have the plans follow the vessel.
The plan for the new vessel is all
ready, however, and we are ready to
go ahead and build her as soon as the
Faith has tested herself on a trial
trip."

HUNT IS COLTER'S CHRIST
Senator Winsor's defense of Gov. Hunt
in the legislature the other day is in a class
all by itself. He declared that if Hunt saw
fit to be embraced and thus photographed
by two wobblies it was nobody's business
but his own, and, that besides, these wob
blies had not then been convicted of treason
against the U. S. government. Quite a de
fense, this. What Hunt, the individual,
does is no one's business but his own as
long as he keeps within laws and decency,
but what Hunt, the governor of this state,
does is the business of every citizen in the
state. This is not an I. V. W. state. It
does not want its chief executive shown to
the general public as the pal of wobblies
and traitors. Again, Senator Colter rushed
in to the governor's defense under fire in a
still more remarkable manner. "Christ, the
biggest Democrat ever known, spent His
time with the criminals and distressed,"
thundered Colter. When a full grown Ari
zona citizen, possessed of powers of reason
and sanity enough to keep outside the walls
of an asylum, compares Hunt with Jesus
Christ, the Nazarene, then let the angels
weep and all Arizona pilgrims cover their
heads with mantle until the jeers and scoff-'
ing of the rest of the southwest have ceased.
After all is said and done, during these
dark days of continued allied reverses and
German gains, the main question is, how
many French and English soldiers were
killed by the Germans in their advance ?
How many Germans were killed in making
these great gains? In cold, hard, stern,
final facts and figures these answers alone
count. It is not in ground gained, and in
cities taken that a battle is measured in
modern war. It is in reserves after that
battle is over. A few hundred allied sol
diers fall back before several thousand
Germans, taking dreadful toll with machine
gun and rifle for every foot of ground
gained . Is this a German victory? Sup
pose the Germans should take Paris itself
and still have a large and powerful French
army with which to contend. They would
have to give up the city as soon as they
took it or run the risk of being cut off from
their own base. In this last smash the
allies seem to have fallen back methodi
cally by a plan arranged beforehand, taking
toll as they withdrew. Their losses, except
for prisoners, are generally agreed to be un
usually light for engagements of such mag
nitude. On the other hand, the Germans,
advancing in waves as usual, suffered
frightful losses. It is rather poor consola
tion right now, thus to point to casualty
lists and ignore the losses of ground and the
onward sweep of the German masses. But.
in the end these losses will haunt the Ger
man generals with frightful intensity. As
sure as fate Foch will strike some day with
the men he saved during these dark days
of German success and allied retreat.
Von Hindenburg, the invincible idol of
Germany, is no longer mentioned at all in
the Berlin dispatches of the great battle
now raging in France. Ludendorff is the
active head of the German offensive, and
the three vons, Bulow, Armrn and Hutig.
are his chief lieutenants. And a year hence;
yes, maybe within six months, Ludendorff
will have been replaced by some other
slaughterer in the hope of gaining definite
results commensurate with the German
losses.
Ex-President Taft, a loyal and earnest
supporter of President Wilson ever since
this nation entered the war, feels keenly
the injustice done Gen. Leonard Wood in
depriving him of his command when his
division was sent over seas for active ser
vice. Mr. Taft declares that Wood is one
of the ablest men in the army. He feels
that Wood was disciplined solely because
of his criticism of our lack of war prepara
tion and efficiency. And then he cites the; .
case cf President Lincoln and Gen. Mc
Clellan during the civil war. When chided
by his advisers for his patience with Mc
Clellan when the latter was making rude
and insulting remarks about him, President
Lincoln declared that he would even hold
McClellan's horse if he would only win
victories for the Union army. Country
first and personal feelings afterwards
should be the spirit of the highest and the
lowest in this country during the period of
the war.
The paving of the street from the depot
to Slag hill, now under way, is one of the
most badly needed improvements in the
district. An immense volume of traffic
passes over this street daily and it has al
ways been in bad condition. The next step
sh6uld be the paving of that stretch cf road
from the foot of Slag hill to the paving of
Johnson Addition. Improvement on this
road does not last two weeks under the bur
den of traffic. As for Slag hill, while it is
doubtless too steep to be paved, yet surely
it can be improved and kept improved over
its present rough and rocky condition. And
it is also to be hoped that the work of pav
ing, long delayed since ground was first
broken, doubtless for lack of material, will
now be rushed through to completion, as
this narrow causeway is now a nightmare
to teams and vehicles deprived of half of
the roadway by the workmen.
After an advance of twenty-five miles
the German masses appear to have been
stopped by the French, with the Americans
giving yeoman assistance in one or two
vital sectors of the present battle front.
But, viewed from any angle, this last drive
has a most depressing effect upon those
who favor the allied cause. This massing
of overwhelming numbers and holding the
edge by long odds for a week of victory is
getting to be monotonous. Only by a
counter blow of the same dimensions can
the allies hope to turn this German tide
eastward. And, while depressed, no loyal
admirer of Foch is discouraged enough to
really doubt for a moment that that counter
blow will yet be struck full and fair at the
breasts of these most worthy sons of Attilla
the Hun.
At last the secret of the real cause of the
strike in the Bisbee copper mines last sum
mer is out. It was brought to light in the
trial of the I. W. W. strike leaders in Chica
go by the government's prosecutor. "Two
hours work a day at a minimum wage of six
dollars." This was the demand of the
wobblies. A modest one we must all ad
mit. Three dollars an hour is a pretty fair
wage scale. And, cf course, price and a
half for over time. And there would surely
have to be a little overtime if any copper
was mined. That would be four dollars
and a half an hour. A fine thing for those
who came to the nest to get the golden
eggs, but at that rate how long would the
goose last?
While Governor Hunt and his political
followers and the wobblies have declared
war upon Cochise county, yet old Cochise
will do very well, thank you, while she has
such champions as Senator Fred Sutter in
the halls of state. Sutter twisted the oppo
sition's tail Monday until Hunt's half dozen
in the senate howled with rage and pain and
were willing and anxious to withdraw the
foul, false clause in a resolution aimed at
the Phelps Dodge corporation without even
bringing it to a test vote. In common de
cency any fair enemy, even, cf this great
corporation will admit that it stands in the
front rank in every patriotic move and war
work of the nation. Not in words, but in
deeds.
In that weird and wonderful message to
the legislature Hunt took occasion to single
out the Bisbee Review for especial and par
ticular invective. While it is an honor to a
newspaper to be mentioned in a state docu
ment, nevertheless this simple editor is glad
and proud that the mention was in the form
of a denunciation, otherwise the "honor '
would have caused the blush of shame to
mount to his modest brow.
If, as Hunt and the Wobblies declare, the
copper companies have grabbed most of the
wealth of Arizona, how does the governor
and his followers account for the fact that
Arizona goes over the top in every war
fund drive with a rush and doubles her
quota for Liberty bonds and the Red
Cross ? Some little war workers, these cop
per companies, eh, governor?

BONUS WAGE PLAN
All employes of the Copper Queeu
company in this district and in the
smelter at Douglas will be put on the
yearly bonus basis beginning July 1
next, and regardless or salary of po
sition will receive $100 for the first
year's continuous service, with
yearly increase for each succeeding
year, according to announcement of
the Phelps Dodge Corporation. Copper
Queen branch, yesterday. Employes
of the Calumet & Arizona and Shat-
tuck companies in this district and of
the C. & A. smelter at Douglas, will
be placed on the same basis, it was
also announced. The order effects
some 4500 men in the Warren dis
trict and about half Uiat number In
Dcuglas. . i
On January 1, last, the Copper
Queen company and other mines of
the district started a bonus plan. At
that time they distributed to each man
who had been in continuous service
for the year succeeding a substantial
check. They announced then thar it
wjs their hope to establish the plan
in the future as a permanent insti
tution of the company. Now, they
have announced the establishment of
the permanent bonus system and
the plan upon which it shall be paid
ii a bulletin which will be distributed
to employes.
Plan of Payment.
Under the plan men who received
bonuses last January will be consid
ered in their second year's employ
ment and men who have received po
sitions since January 1, will be con
sidered in their first year's employ
ment. Payment of the bonus checks
will be made on the first payday
following the completion of a year s
continuous service. Observance of
the thirty-day holiday rule is es
pecially urged in the bulletin, which
makes provision for the manner in
which each man must notify the em
ployment agent of leaves from work
granted. Leave because of sickness
does net count againt the year's employment.
Following is the statement of tne
company outlining the new plan and
giving details of how it shall be
worked :
"When bonus was paid last Janu
ary we stated that we hoped to an
nounce later it would be permanent.
This announcement has been made
recently and we desire to present the
plan more in detail, as follows:
"1. After July 1, 1918. every em
ploye who has remained in the serv
ice of the company continuously for
one year will receive a bonus of $100
cn completion of his year's service,
and for each additional year of con
tinuous service an additional $10 will
be paid until tne annual honus
amounts to $250, when no further in
crease will be made in the annual
bonus.
Wage Rate Disregarded.
"2. The bonus is in no way re
lated to the wage rate, or kind of
work done. It is a flat bonus for con
tinuous service and the same amount
will be paid to every employe regard
less of his daily wage, monthly salary
or nationality.

AMERICAN RAIDERS
SAVE FRENCH SHIP
FROM SEASERPENT
(Continued from Fuse One)
Wilmington, Del., was still .hunting
for the enemy.
The announcement which naval
officers said contained all the de
partment knew about today's activi
ties of the raiders, fellows:
Saves French Vessel.
"The navy department has re
ceived a dispatch from a United States
destroyer that at 9:30 o'clock this
morning she interrupted an attack by
an enemy submarine on the French
steamer Radioleine about C5 miles off
the Maryland coast. The destroyer al
so took on board two men from the
Kdward Baird, which was bombed and
sinking.
"A later report was rcrcTVeil slating
that the Radioleine had arrived at an
Atlantic port."
Reports from survivors who were
aboard the vessels also established the
fact that during the day at least two
submarines Jiave been at work in
American waters. They are the U-37
and the U-151 and a -report to the
navy department shows that one of
them at least had stores to last three
months.
Members of congress who conferred
witli Secretary Daniels today were
convinced that everything possible
was being done that could be done
without lessening American efforts
to crush the enemy in France.
Panic Among Snippers.
f.lie raiders have rreitiort panic
among coastwise shipping, but they
have dene no military damage what
ever. The picking up of a floating mine
off the New Jersey shore was an
nounced today by the navy depart
ment. Undoubtedly it was dropped
by one of the enemy V-boa!s. Possibly
the raider was closely pursued and
thought to lay a trap for Jier pur
suer. The official list of the vessels sunk
by the U-boats as givrn out tonight
at the navy department included seven
schooners and four steamers. The
statement follows:

(By Review Leased Wire)
MONTGOMERY. Ala., June 4
Aviation Cadet Geore O. Mills ol
Jersey city. X. J., was killed late to
day when his plane caught fire and
fell 2.0i0 feet near Taylor field.
Cadet Mills had been up or.lv a short
time and was about two miles from TtJeneral Motors
the aviation field near here when ob
strvors saw his machine burst into
flames. The aviaVr loed ,ie loop
and while th-; machine was upside

ly he was seen hanging by his hands
as the machine plunged downward.
SAN ANTONIO ACCIDENT
SAN ANTONIO, Tex., June 4. Sec
ond Lieutenant Joseph John O'Mally,
uj:e 26, of Albany, Mar. was instantly
killed here today when his airplane
went Into a tail spin and could not
be righted. A companion whose name
was not disclosed by the authorities,
escaped unhurt.
O'Mally was flying at Ml altjiiid-;
of several hundred feet but too near
to earth to straighten out his plane
from Uie spin before it crashed into
the ground. He was a stundcnt ofti-
cer at Crooks field and his death was
the first fatality among men ut that
camp and the eighteenth death among
flyers at San Antonio camps. Before
entering the aviation service O'Mally
was a student at the Colorado school
of mines.
Baldwin Locomotive was foremost
among equipments at an extreme ad

J $95.32. The general bond list was
Irregular. Total sales (par value),
aggregated $7,250,000. United States
bonds (old issues) were unchanged on
call.
GRAINS
CHICAGO, June 4. Corn rallied
briskly today from the bearish effects
of the submarine raids. Prices closed
firm, 2 to 3 cents net higher with June
$1.30 and July $1.CS:K. Oats gained
cents to 2Vi cents and provisions
20 cents to 50 cents.
It was evident from the outset that
the flurry over U-boats had" come to
an end so far as the corn market was
involved.
Seding pressure, which was so ob
vious the previous day had greatly
diminished and shorts quickly toon
the lead in the buying. Reports that
rains were delaying cultivation gave
additional impetus to the upward
swing of prices. Last prices were at
the topmost level of the session.
Activity by seaboard exporters
helped to lift the value of oats.
Provisions responded to the advance
of grain and hogs.

BRAZEN ATTACK ON BISBEE CITIZENS
Continued from Page One)
those deadly fops of organized gov
ernment. "There is nothing in the proclama
tion calling this special session that
could justify any reference whatso
ever to the Bisbee affair. Therefore,
no oth,er conclusion can be drawn
than that it was injected for the pur
pose of playing petty politics, vent
ing personal spite, stirring up strife
and widening if possible the already
existing breach between capital End
labor at the expense of the people of
the state. If ever a. time existed when thpt the best recommendation that ap
the officials of a state should use ev- pointee had for loyalty to his eovern
ery influence in their power :o eradl- ment was the fact that he had allo
cate the differences between capital scribed ' to the Red Cross lund, no
and labor and prir.g together employer part of which lie iias ever paid,
and employe, it is now. And that man. ' And now Mr. President, I turn to
it makes no difference to me if he be tne governor's mesage and I find that
the millionaire employer, the high np. condemns those who deported th
state official, or the representative of i w. W.'s and their sympathizers on
organized labor, who, now, for polit- j
itcal purposes or personal gain at
tempts to array class against class,
stir up dissatisfaction and incite
hatred of employe for employer, is an
enemy, not only cf capital but is an
enemy as well of labor and a greater
enemy of the government in its pros
ecution of the war.
Common Ground.
"There should be a common plain,
some place on which labor and capi
tal can fairly meet, a plain on which
can be fairly discussed labor's griev
ances and capital's rights, put that
plain can never be reached as long as
' the cheif executive of a state persists
in hurling into the ranks of labor
firebrands of hatred and venom in
tended to inflame the minds of the
workers against the interests of the
employers, for no ether purpose and
with any other idea than that of mak
ing political capital and affording an
opportunity of posing as the savior
of the toiling masses from the aggres
sions of the employing classes.
"Mr. President, clouds indeed and
darkness must rest upon the future
of that state over which presides a
chief executive whose vision is so nar
row that there appears to him to be
but one side to the great problems
arising between labor and capital, who
in public utterances and private
speech is ever ready t attack with
vile epithets and degrading names the
investors of capital who have built
up the state and made it possible for
the employment of labor, who in sea
son and out of season vents his
spleen and spits forth, his hatred of
those men, or corporations, who have
been fortunate enough to accumulate
a sufficient amount of wealth to be
come employers; who rather than see
peace and tranquility prevail would
prefer to see strikes and disorder,
lest he lose his hold on the toiling
vot ers.
Paints Sorry Picture.
"Mr. President, it's a sorry picture
that I have painted, but in painting
it I have intended no attack on the
cause of .him who toils. 'His cause is
a just one. I bow to no man in my
fealty to him who toils with,his hands.
I' am one of those who believe that
the totiler never receives more than
he earns and seldom gets what he is
entitled to. But in my championship
of his cause I am fair enough to see
the other side, I am fair enough, if
ycu. please, sir, to be are to distin-
guish between an honest labor union,
working to better the cause of the toil
ers and the organization known as
the I. W. W., the enemy cf organized
labor and the foe of organized gov
ernment. I am not, Mr. President,
one of those pretended friends of the
honest working man, who would sarin
a public document that the I. W. W.
was the deadly enemy of organized
labor when on a previous occasion
I had had my picture taken in the
embrace of two I. W. W.'s who at the
present time are being prosecuted by
the federal government, charged with
sedition. 1 believe, Mr. President, we
only have our pictures taken with
our friends. But-1 have before me,
sir, a booklet purporting to eminate
from the 'Cook county Jail, In Chi
cago. On page 16 thereof I am
ashamed to say I find the picture of
what 'I am told is the governor of the
state of Arizona, standing with his
arms around two leading I. W. W.'s,
both of whom are now on trial for se
ditious utterances against the United
States. I blush with humiliation as 1
am forced to admit that were it not for
the legend at the bottom of the pic
ture I would be unable to decide which
of the two were the I. W. W. s who
are being prosecuted. Shame again
mounts to my cheeks as I turn to page
4 of the booklet in which the picture of
our chief executive appears and find
the following addressed to II. G. Cla
bough, of the department of Justice of
the United States:
"We understand how you,' as
an ex-officer of the navy, prob
ably learned all you know of de
mocracy at that school of snob-
btxey named Annapolis.
Blood Boils.
"Mr. President, you being a loyal
American citizen, your blood must
boil with righteous indignation as
you hear the school from which the
officers of our navy are graduated,
who are now fighting that democracy
might live throughout the world, in
sulted and outraged, when, but a few
pages over in the same book you find
the picture of your phvernor in tiie
embraces cf some of the authors of
that insult.
"And Jagajn, Mf. iPresident. .turn
ing back from page 16 of this se
ditious booklet on which page the
chief executive's picture appears, to
page 12, I find the following lan
guage :
"The I. W. W. took no official
cognizance of the war one way
or the other. Its war was the
class war. and its attitude neither
pro-ally nor prof lerman.
Treasonable Words
"Those treasonable words purport
to have been written January 2, 191 S,
and In them the I. W. W. says it took

end would permit one of his ap
pointees to, journey to Chitago to U-
; fend him. notwithstanding the fact
t.iie ground that the strike that was in
existence there was not a strike of
the I. W. W.' but a strike of honest
laborers and backed by honest labor
unions. IT the governor is wrong and
lie strike was called by the I. W. W.,
and the men deported were I. W. W.'s
and their sympathizers, then the gov
ernor's accusation must lose its force
and some degree of justification be
accorded the deporters.
Pre-Strike Conditional
"On the 2Cth day of June, 1917,
4,718 men were employed in the
mines of the Warren district, includ
n union and non-union men and I.
W. W.'s. The wage paid those men at
that time was $5.60 for a day's work
of ei'-'ht hours. Working conditions
were on equality with those of any
other mining district in the United
States. For several months prior c
Tune 26th the I. W. W.'s began to as
semble in the district and organize
the men under what they termed the
Metal Mine Workers Industrial Union
No. 800, which is an accredited brancn
of the I. W. W. Prior to this time
there existed in the Warren district
what was known as Bisbee Local No.
106, International Union of Mine, Mill
& Smelter workers, which is a branch
of the American Federation of Labor,
which is the union recognized as the
letrally constituted Miners' union by
the miners in almost every camp in
the United States. The I. W. W.'s in
their organization worked secretly at
first, but later came out in the open.
Their membershin grew until in the
month of May, 1917, their membership
exceeded that of the International
Union of Mine, Mill and Smelter work
ers in that district. Having obtained
i majority of membership the I. W.
W.'s took possession of the hall occu
pied by the legally constituted Miner?
Union and the Warren District Trades
Assembly. The Trades Assembly was
forced to vacate the hall and took up
nther Quarters. The International
Union of Mine, Mill and Smelter
Workers was gradualy absorJied by
the I. W. W. through its branch,
known as the Metal Mine Workers.
I. W. W. Make Demands
"On June 26th, 1917, the I. W. W.,
through its branch organization, made
the following demands of the mining
companies:
First: The abolition of the physical
examination.
Second: Two men to work on ma
chines. Third: Two men to work together
in all raises.
Fourth. To discontinue all blasting
during the shift.
Fifth: The abolition of all bonus and
contract work.
Sixth: To abolish the sliding scale.
AM men underground a minimum flat
rate of $6 per shift. Top men $5.50
per shift.
Seventh: No discrimination to be
shown against members ot any orgpn
ization. "No answer was made by the com
panies and a strike was called thafc
night without a referendum vote being
taken. The tirst knowledge that the
miners had that a strike had oeen
called was the appearance of pickets
as they were coming off shift. Three
-'ays prior to the calling of the strike,
Charles F. Mover, president of the In
ternational Mine, Mill and Smelter
Workers' Union, demanded the sur
render of the local charter on account
of non-payment of dues. Tho secre
tary attempted to sell the furniture
and lease of the Miners' Union and a
committee of which the secretary of
the Miners' Union was a member. In
terviewed the owner of the building
to that end. All of this was made pos
sible by the absorption of the mem
bership of the local Mine, Mill and
Smelter Workers' Union by the I. W.
W. branch union. The strike con
tinued until the morning of July 12th.
All of the mines were practically
closed and the production or copper
practically stopped. On July 1st, Tom
J. White and C. K. Jacobson. Dotn
members of the American Federation
of Labor, sent to Chas. H. Moyer, pres
ident of that organization tne ioiiow-
ing telegram:
"To Chas. H. Moyer,

a circular which, among other things,
contained the following:

"Can any honest fair-minded citizen
after reading the above stated facts
doubt that the strike in the Warren
district which led up to the deporta
tion of 1.186 men on July 12, !917.
was no' ordered, carried and prosecut
ed by the I. W. W. and was not called
nor sanctioned by the American Fed
eration of Labor nor by any of its
branches. If the strike in Bisbee was
called by the I. W. W. what other con
clusion can be? drawn than that it wru
called for the purpose of hindering
the government in the prosecution of
the war? The governor states in lis
message that of the 1.186 men dc-
l ported. 472 were registered under tlu
draft law. Why did he not tell you
further that out of the 472 registered,
enlv thirty-three have been called into
the service as shown by the records
of the local board of Cochise county?
Why did he not tell you that the re
mainder were either alien enemies,
aliens, or men not subject to th.1
draft? Did the author of the mes
sage desire to leave the impression
that 472 men registered and dorrrte'i
were subject to the draft and were
now enlisted, fighting for their coun
try? Misses Truth Far
. The governor tells you in his mes
sage that 205 of the deported men were
holders of liberty bond.?. In this state
ment he only missed the truth by 1!S.
The following is a statement of facts
showing the number of men working
for each mining company in the War
ren district who were deported and the
bonds subscribed for by each of such
men:

"The further statement is made in
the governor's message that nearly
twelve hundred working men were de
ported on July 12th. 1 ! 1 7. I have had
prepareil from the records of the min-
i mg eoniuunios a statement showing
jnsi'ctly th number of men deported
'who were working for the companies
I prior to the strike. The statement is
as follows:

Agitators in District.
"From t.he above statement it ap
pears that only 10 per cent of all or
the men working for the company
were deported. That, of the men de
ported 59.4 per cent had never worked
for the companies, from which no oth
er conclusion can he drawn than that
the men who made up the 59.4 per
cent were out in the district to work
but for the purpose of agitation and
stirring up trouble. Thp testimony
introduced in the trial of the I. W.
W.'s in Chicago in the last few days
shows that at the time of the Bis
bee strike Arizona was full of I. W.
W. agitators. It shows that. Stanley
J Clark, the I. W. W. who signed the
circulars distributed in Bisbee and
who is now being tried for seditious
atteranoes. tcld the gurernor of Ari
zona tat unless the miners got what
they wanted not a bushel or wheat
would be harvested in the northwest,
and the evidence rurther shows that
Clark made the statement. 'That the
government liad better keep seven
! million of their soldiers on this side
cf the ocean to put down rebellions
and strikes,' and Mr. President. Clark
js one of the honest working men re
ferred to by the eovernor. The ev
idence in the Chicago case further
shows that Crover H. Perry, one of
the governor's pieturemates. made
the following statement:
"The government says the draft
is going into effect September 1st,
but so far as the I. W. W. miners
are concerned It is not going in
to effect at all.
Admits I. W. W. Deported
"The governor admits in his mes
sage t.hht 426 of the Reported men
were I. W. W. and according to Gro
ver H. Perry, their leader and friend
of the governor, they did not intend
io be effected by the draft.
"It is not my purpose, Mr. .Presi
dent, to discuss the right or wrong of
the Pisbee deportations. That ques
tion should be left for the courts to
pass upon. But I will say this, that
i so far as I am concerned, I stand
for the state of Arizona, yes and the
United States of . America ridding
themselves of every foe of organized
government, of which there is none
greater than the I. W. W.. The meth
od of ridding ourselves of this treas
onable foe may be debatable, but so
far as I am concerned, I look more
to the results than the method. And
what are the results in Bisbee Bince
the deportation? They are, sir. a
J practically cne hundred, per cent
I American camp. A foreigner to get
i a job there today has to sive a pretty
i good" account or himself, an increase o?
33 per cent in the number of children
attending school; the erection of
three pew school buildings and the
completion of over 300 new dwell
ing homes. More miners own their
own homes in the Warren district than
in any other mining camp in the
United States. The mines are today
producing more copper than ever be
fore and we are a quiet, peaceful, law
abiding community and will continue
so, so long as the I. W. W. and other
enemies iof the government let us
alone.
Do Not Coddle Enemies.
"But. Mr. President. I cannot agree
with the advice or the governor in
his message when he advises that,
'The surest way to discourage the
Wobblies and the destructive spirit
that animates them is to maintain an
absolute silence regarding their ac
tivities." Why, sir. if an enemy were
at your door, threatening your life
and the destruction of your property
and your neighbors started to sound
the alarta, but on among them
would there not arise a doubt in your
mind as to the sincerity or that
neighbors friendship? would you
not ask yourself the question whether!

brought to justice.
Contrasted Statement
"Mr. President. 1 ti.ru ;o tiie last
page of the governor's message and I
find sentiments expressed there teem-
i ing with patriotic fervor. I find the
following words:
"With quickened sympathies
and heightened courage, we com
pose ourselves for the battle
shocks tiiat our country must
withstand, knowing full well that
our cause is righteous.
"Our cause, if you please, sir. is
the cause of our allies, is the cause for
which our allies have been fighting
since the commencement of the war,
and knowing that our cause Is com
mon witji that of cur allies, I cannot
help contrasting those fine words or
the governor's with his statement to
tlio Associated Press on June 13, 1915,
In which he said:
"It is permissable to question
the mortal right of any non bclir;
erant nation to furnish combat
ants with prodigious quantities of
arms and an. munitions, thereby
facilitating and tacitly encourag
ing on a collosal scale the slaugh
ter of human beings (meaning the
Huns). It is time for dollar re
trenchment in deference to hu
manity's advancement.
"Our allies were fighting for tho
same cause sir when that interview
was given as they are today. But to
day our governor tells us in his mes
sage that 'Ship load after ship load
of munitions must leave our ports with
clock-like regularity to maintain th-?
alliod armies in France, Belgium and
Italy.' Why this change of sentiment
from a pacifist to warrior? Is it be
cause In 1915 it was popular among a
certain class to rant against the gov
ernment for permitting the shipment
of munitions to our allies, while in
1918 the mouths of that class have
been closed by the hand of the gov
ernment and it is better now to main
tain an eloquent silence?
No Time for Strife
"Mr. President. I regret that the seed
of discord was permitted to be sown
in the document I have been discus
sing. This is no time to stir up strife
and foster dissention. Public men
should confine themselves to those ut
terances only that tend to bring about
the united effor of all classes in aid-
Ling the government. Those sentiments
oniy snouiu De spoxen mat would aid
in binding together more closely in i
common bond of patriotism the rich
and tho poor, the employer and the
employes, until there exists in our
country sucha unity or purpose and
endeavor as will overwhelm the hun
and bring peace to the world, a peace
lot negotiated on the sacred soil of
France, but a peace dictated with the
American flag flying from the citadel
or Berlin.
"Mr. President, the time has .past
when ranting against an employer ot
labor in this state can be popular
The employer, the employe and the
government have become partners in
the carrying on of our industries. The
government has said to the operators
of eopner mines, for your product you
shall receive so much and to the em
ploye it has said, for your labor in pro
ducing that product you shall receive
a certain wage. A strike in the cop
per mines at this time is not a strike
against capital but a strike against
the government. It would be a strike
against our soldiers enlisted from tho
verv ranks of labor. -Therefore, in
dustrial disorders I believe are out or
the ouestion. I have confidence in the
laboring men of our state. I believe
n their patriotism and trofet in their
lovalty and it is mv opinion that In
snite of the agitators you will find
them hacking hd our . bovs in the
trenches, with their muscle, brains and
brswn. while their emnlovers shov
heir nvMtv in financing the war un
til it is brought to a successful con
clusion. Sonare Deal Policy
"Mr. President, there is nothing thst
nnesls to the American neoplo like
the soirlt of fairness. The average
American citizen is ror a square del
ror those to whom he Is opposed as
well as to those whom he tavors. It's

been Unlaw-rully driven rrom their

Changes of Heart
"How different are the sentiments
expressed in the letter just reHd from
the expressions contained in the gov-
ernor's message on the subject of un
lawful deportations. Was there any
law in the statutes that permitted the
driving the men from their homes in
191 that was not there in 1917. or
must the governor's chi'-.'.ge of heart
be accounted for l.y the fact that it
was his friends who did the deporting
ir the one case while it wa. those who
were not always in accord with his
policies v. ho did it in the other. In
referring to this blatter I do not wish

j that long hoped for relief, but it hai
and I'll praise it as long as I live,

most cut off my breath. I couldn't
eat an apple or an orange without it
making me almost deathly sick, anil
milk was just like poison to nic. I
had no appetite at all, could eat no
meats of any kind, and for years simu
ly suffered agony. At times I was
almost prostrated with headache, and
my nerves were all shattered. I was
so nervous and miserable I cou'nl get
no rest day or night, and felt tired
and worn out all the time. Last fall
my condition became so serious tiiut
my family was alarmed about me. I
had given up nearly all hope f ever
getting relief, and was rsa"y afraid I
would soon die unless I con! 1 get some
thing to help me.
"About the first of January I ipad
! the testimonial of a party I knew, and
, who had gotten sucn wonaernu iesj;is
' from Tanlac, that I decided to try it
myself. Well. if Tanlac had failed me
: I don't know what I would have done,
i as I think I had tried everything else.
But it hasn't failed me, I'm thankful
to say. On the other hand I feel lust j
like a new person since taKing it. i
didn't feel much benefit from my first I
bottle, but by the time my 6econd bet-;
tie was gone I felt a general improve ,
ment. My appetite picked up and since I
that time I have had no more pain or j
smothering spells. I have taken three
bottles now and can sleep all niht j
i long, and that tired, worn out feeling j
! has left me. I am not the least bit i
I nervous any more, and my stomach is
in such fine condition that I can eat
meats and anything else I want with- j
out the slightest discomfort from it.
I find real pleasure now in living, as
I'm able to work, and since Tanlac
has done' so much for me I feel like
I ought to do what I can to let others
know about it."

KEPT HER AWAKE
The Terrible Pains in Back and
Sides. Cardui Gave Relief.
Maricsville, La. Mrs. Alkft Johnson,
of this place, writes: "For one year 1
suffered with an awful misery in my back
and sides. My left side was hurting me
all the time. The misery was something
awful
I could not do anything, not even sleep
at night. It kept me awake most of the
night ... I took different medicines, but
nothing did me any good or relieved me
until 1 took Cardui . . .
I was not able to do any of my work
for one year and I got worse all the time,
was confined to my bed off and on. I got
to bad with my back that when I stooped
down I was not able to straighten up
again ... I decided I would try Cardui
. . . By time I had taken the entire bottle
I was feeling pretty good and could
straighten up and my pains were nearly
all gone.
I shall always praise Cardui. I con
tinued taking it until I was strong and
well." If you suffer from pains due to
female complaints, Cardui may be just
what you need. Thousands of women
who once suffered in this way now praise
Cardui for their present good health,

CANANEA RED CROSS.
The Americans of Cananea showed
themselves to be one hundred per
cent patriotic in the recent Red Cross
drive for an hundred million dollars.
There are some tw hundred Amer
icans in the Cananea district and
their quota was set at $1000. They
raised over 600 per cent of their
quota and ran up their total to
$5700. A bazaar netted $1500 and a
jitney dance brought in $350. The
Cananea Red Cross recently raised
$14500 for the Red Cross and al
though they are outside the bound

that interfere with their duties to
the mother country.
PICTURES WANTED.
The Arizona council of defense has
been asked to help in securing for the
war department photographs, draw
ings and descriptions of bridges, build
ings, towns and localities now occu
pied by the Gennan forces in France,
Belgium and Luxbourg, and likewise in
that part of Germany lying west of
the line running north and south
through Hamburg. A large quantity
of such material is desired and may be

avoid duplication. It will be practic

back with them photographs or even
post cards of the localities noted.
