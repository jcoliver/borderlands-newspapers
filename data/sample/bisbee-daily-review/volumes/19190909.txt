(Special to The Review)
DOUGLAS, Ariz., Sept. 8. Richard
Denning, who might be styled "the
man with the marvelous memory"
was the state witness during the
matinee that opened the third week's
.run of the preliminary hearing of the
200 Douglas and Bisbee citizens
charged with kidnapping as a result
of the deportations that followed the
I. W. W. trouble in the Warren min
ing district two years ago last July.
Without -the aid of a magic cabinet
or any other stage paraphrenalia, and
with nothing up either sleeve, ladies
and gentlemen, Denning, from the
witness stand in the center of the
stage, described the actions and
moves of more than 50 of the de
fendants, ' thus setting a new record
for the state's witnesses. ,
Denning Now Champion Witness
His appearance yesterday placed
Denning, who had previously testified
against more than a dozen of the de
fendants in the first 49 cases heard,
at the head of the list as the state's
champion witness. All of the men
against whom the witness testified
were seen by him, he said, taking part
in the deportations on July ,12, 1917.
Expecting that counsel for the de
fense would question Denning as to
each man against whom the witness
testified, the county attorney had onlyj
one witness ready to take the stand
when Denning was through. The de
fense, however, asked the witness to
identify but one of the many defend',
ants named by him and then excused
him.
County Attorney Gets Surprise
The county attorney had a second
surprise during the afternoon ses
sion. After questioning Joe Kinkella,
a Slavonian witness brought here
from Silver Eell. Ariz., regarding the
actions of the f Warren district men
who Kinkella said had seen taking
part in the deportations, the "county
attorney was asked if he was aware
of the fact that of the three named
by the witness, not a single one was
a defendant in tne case now being
heard. The -county attorney after;
asking the court if this were tru,
decided that he made a mistake.
Inasmuch as Kinkella had given dl-j
rect testimony against the three men,
Lawrence Ingram, who had never .
been arrested, W. Mitchell of Cana-j
and Oscar . Gilma'n, whose case
was bound over 'to me superior
court for trial . more than
three weeks ago, he was cross-examined
by counsel for the, defendant.
Kinkella said he was arrested ' on the
morning of thevda"y of the deporta
tions ; in Lowell by men whom, he"
said, he did not know. Kinkella said
he asked these men. as they started
to "put him in line" if they would not"
let him ride out of the district on
his motorcycle.
Box Car For Austrian I. W. W.
The men) however,, according to
the witness, advised him "we'll give
you a better ride than that." Kink
ella sn'1 he took the ride in a box
car. The witness said that he had
joined the I. W. W. about a week
before the deportations. He was
born under Austrian rule, he said,
and had only taken out his first
papers.
Three natives of England, Paddy
J. Burns, Fred Penna and John R.
Conner,, were called as witnesses for
the state during the session.
Paddy, Burns testified to having
pern Jffk Black, a mine shift boss
of the Warren district, standing what
the witness termed "guard" in the
baseball park at Warren during the
deportations. . Black was not armed

NEW YORK, Sept. 8. America
welcomed General Pershing today.
Honored by foreign rulers and gov
ernments, the commander-in-chief of
the mightiest army that ever fought
its way to victory under the Stars and
Stripes returned to his own folk to
meet a greater honor than-any foreign
potentate or power could confer the
thanks of the world's greatest democ
racy to the man who had planned the
decisive blow in democracy's supreme
fight against tyranny.
The e( em-faced soldier who had
maintained fats Iron serf control amid
the shambles of the Meuse and the
blood drenched forest of Argonne, was
not proof against the tribute pf braise
and gratitude which was roared from
hundreds of thouands of throats and
hearts of his fellow cRfzens.
Commander Loses Composure
His voice trembled with emotion as
he responded to the greetings ex
tended by Secretary of War Baker in
his own behalf and that of the presi
dent as well as the welcoming ad
dresses of representatives of the Ben-
ate and house, the state and city.
As his car passed slowly through
the scheering multitudes which jam
med" the roadway from the battery to
the city . hal. Pershing attempted In
vain to maintain his composure. At
first he replied to the cheers with the
stiff salute which military etiquette
demands, but ' hq was soon carried
away by the storm of applause which
swept in great gusts about. Rising to
his feet he -waved his cap above his
head with a boyish gesture which told
how deeply he was stirred, while the
giim lines of his bronzed face broke
into a smile which was as Infectious
as it was rare. ,
Prouder Moment-Yet Remains
It was a proud moment for the great
American soldier, but a prouder still
remains. New York did not exhaust
its welcome today; Wednesday he will
ride down Fifth avenue at the head
of the First division of the regular
army, the first to go and last to leave,
victors in the first battle ever fought
on European soil by American soldiers.-
'
Surrounded by comrades humbler in
station, but who had offered their all
just as freely in the cause of liberty,
Geueral Pershing first reglimpsed Ms
native ' land. When the huge Levia
than, once the pride of Germany, nos
ed her way through the mists off the
Jersey coast the general stood upon
her deck with the famous "compo
site regiment," 3000 picked American
soldiers, known as "Pershing's own."
These stalwart ' soldiers were his
guard of honor when Paris and Lon
don paid tribute to the American
commander and they will be his
guard of honor when his own coun
try pays its full meed of praise Wed
nesday. Daker Presents Commissions
Just after the general walked down
the gang plank at Hoboken he re
ceived the first reward which a grate
ful country has offered him. In the
name of the nation Secretary of War
Baker banded him his commission as

rank held previously by only three

on tne world's affairs.
'"I want to tell you." said th nrel.
dent, "that within the last two week
the pro-German element in the United
biates again nas lifted its head."
This element saw a chance, he said
by keeping their . nation out of the
league of nations, to make possible
again what Germany had tried to do
in the ereat war. It wa a i-ieon.raf
issue, Mr. Wilson declared, between
tnis new order or the old German
order.
Appeal to Organized Labor
Declaring the peace treatv nroTi-
sion for an international labor con
ference would eive labor a new hill
of rights, the president declared the
treaty was a "laboring: man's treatv"
in, the same sense that it was a
treaty drawn un for the benefit rtf
the' common people.
The political settlements them
selves, said the president, were made
for the peoples concerned. He as
serted that the document laid down
forever the tirinciole that no terri
tory ever should be eoverned ercpnt
as the people who lived there wanted
it governed.
'That is an absolute revernal nf
history ," said the Dresident. "and ita

said that was somewhat like what
had happend in Europe and a cen

ilize - conditions and prevent strife
"Your choice," said Mr. Wilson, "is
between, the league of nations and
Germanism. I have told you what
I mean by Germanism having a chip
on your shoulder."
Ford Was One, Too
When the. president added that
sometimes he had been called "an
idealist" someone shouted "good" and
the crowd cheered.
"The certain way" to have trouble
between capital and labor, said the
president, was for them to refuse to
discuss their differences. He said
he could not understand how a man
could refuse to discuss his case un
less he was wrong. The same rule,
he declared, applied to differences
between nations.
America could stay out of the
league, said the president, but it
would be at the expense of the peace
of the world.
America Necessary to Peace of World
"America is necessary," he added.
"to the peace of the world. And the
peace and confidence of the world
are necessary to America."
Although it was raining when the
president's train arrived, the down
town streets were lined with crowds
and a wave of cheering followed the
president on his way to the Coliseum
A Shriners' band led the parade
Governor Peter Norbeck, a Republi
can, presided at the meeting. - Mrs.

den "by thelmpoRlng figure of the
general, was a little 'boy trying to
look very dignified ie BOldierly. He
was "Sergeant" Warren Pershing, the
commander-in-chief's only surviving
child. When the general received
his commission he turned to bis son
and handed him the document with
an Injunction to keep it safe. The
"sergeant" kept it safely all right, but
later on, In the great crowd at the city
hall, he got separated from his father,
much to the dihmay of the general.
When the boy wa recovered his
fathtr naked anxiously:
. "Warren, have you got the com
mission ?" .. ..
Yes, sir," replied the "sergeant"
promptly. .
'Well, see that you. hold on to it."
The army and official family did not
have it all their own way fit the pre
liminary reception at Hoboken.
Fifty Girls Green General . ,
Among a little army of welfare
workers who greeted General Persh
1ns were 50 girls, three of whom were
decorated for bravery under fire while
serving with the First crvisldn. Eight
naval seaplanes soared and circled
over the Leviathan as she steamed up
the bay and .Included in the commit-'
tee at the dock was Rear Admiral Mor
gan, commander of the cruiser and
transport Bervice. 1
: But it was reserved to New York to
begin the real ovation to the return
ing hero.' For liours before the arri
val of the general, the "Battery" was"
throngod with patient thousands who
stood in serried ranks silently wait
ing. As the little boat with its .dis
tinguished party steamed up to the
pier an uproar began such as Man
hattan probably never had heard be
fore. From a thousand factories and
vessels steam . sirens shrieked out a
raucous, welcome, but vainly tried to.
drown the roar of cheers which rose
and feli and rose again. Overhead,
airplanes dipped and circled, but the ,
drone of their engines .was scarcely ,
audible and the most -raiiant effort of
the fire department's band served '
only to give the impression of a num- .;
ber of men who were silently trying
to blow themselves ut arter the man
ner of the frog in the fable. :
At first General Pershing semed to
be suffering more from embarrass- -ment
than any other emotion. He
walked swiftly from the landing stage i
to his gaily decorated automobile, and
settled himself down In his seat like '
a man who has an important journey
to make and wants to get it over as,
quickly as possible. Hut as the J6ng
procession of cars started up Bcoad-tj
way he was engulfed in a flood ofen-'j
thuslasm before which no man could
have emained unmoved.

Kissing Not on. Program
The enthusiasm of the spectators
found vent in one unrehearsed inci-J
dent which was received by General
Pershing with apparently mingled
feelings. As he entered the city hall
flanked by Governor Smith and Mayor
Hylan, a woman burst past the police
guard and Implanted a sound' kiss on
his cheek. Another woman, stirred to
emulation, attempted 'to .repeat the
feat; but the general rfcisea his hand

A littl further on a large junk shop

So many invitations have been ex

claimed, was. not sufficient to supply
hia needs and so, when the strike
was declared, he dropped his mem
bership in the Western Federation of
Miners and joined the I. W. W. to
get something to eat. Asked by At
torney W. H. Eurgess if the I. W.
W. had given him anything to eat
during the strike trouble, Penna re
plied, "Yes a bit of bread, a bit of,
meat and some vegetables."
Would Like His Mine Job Back .
Penna said that, at the time of the
strike, he was making more than ever
before in his life.
"I wish now that I had never come
out of the mines," he sighed.
"Would you like to be In the mines
on your job?" asked one of the at
torneys for the defendants.
Penna -nodded his head, "You've
got me now." "
Penna testified to having seen
Ernest Burgess. Al Cromer and Harry
Lyons acting as guards at the ball
park. He also saw James McGarry
and Frank Thompson, he said, march
ing beside the deported men when
they were taken from Lowell to Warren.
The witness said that he was ar
rested on Naco road by several men
who stopped him and asked him if
"he was an I. W. W." When he re
plied that he "was a wobbly at the
present time," said Penna, these men
took him into custody. He did not
know who these men were,' said the
witness.
John R. Conner of Ray, testified to
having seen Tom Murphy and Jack
Radcliffe, . Warren district mining
men, in the baseball park, armed,
during the deportations. He saw
neither defendant speak to any of the
deported men or place any one under
arrest, admitted the witness. Con
ner said he was taken from his horn
in Bisbee by six men on the morning
of the day of the deportations. One
of these men, Tom .Maden. said the
witness on direct examination,
"struck my wife." Questioned as to
this incident during cross-examination,
Conner explained the matter and
It turned out that the alleged blow
had been more in the nature of a

W., said the witness, because he want--ed
his pay raised to $6.00 a day in-
stead of $5.85, which he was drawing
at the time. The fact that the
United States was at war and needed
copper did not affect his decision
to go on strike, said the witness. Con

FEDERAL AID
FOR COCHISE
COUiTlfliS
The report of road conditions in
Cochise county as compiled by A. H.
Gardner, secretary of the Cochise
County Highway commission, fol
lows :
The present Cochise County High
way commission will turn over the
unfinished work to the new highway
commission on the 15th of this month.
The commission has completed and
accepted from the contractors up to
date three pieces of work, that of the
Improvements to the paved road in
Lowell, the Cochlse-Pearoe road and
ine: Tombstone to Benson road.
Work is progressing very favorably
now on all of the unfinished work be
tween Lowell and Bernardino In the
Silver creek country. The link thai
would have been left unpaved, (owing
to changed conditions brought on by
the war) between Forrest Station and
Forrest Ranch will now be paved with
the assistance of federal aid Becured
by the commission through State En
gineer Thos. Maddock. Also it might
he added that In addition to that
$105,000 secured from federal aid Mr.
Maddock has secured $53,000 federal
aid to be used in extending the road
east towards Rodeo.
The board of supervisors have ar
ranged With State Engineer MndrtnrV
to secure federal aid to build the
road from Benson to the Pima county
line. This application followed the
Bisbee-Douglas section and Douglas
East section, and will probably be ap
proved within the next few days as it
Is in conjunction with' the application
for federal aid of the entire section
from Vail to Benson road. There are
many conditions surrounding the se
curing of federal aid which those
who have not studied that matter do
not know. All this work is to be
done : by 5 contract.

Mickey Scanlon in
Bisbee, Jailed on
Charge of Vagrany
M. J. (Mickey) Scanlon, notorious
leader and organizer of the Wobblies,
will be asked to show cause in Judge
Hogan's court this morning why he
should not shake the dust of Bisbes
off his shoes provided he does no
jump his $100 bond which Charles
Bentley put up to ensure his ap
pearance following his arrest by
Chief Al Kempton and Sergeant Hill
Ruff yesterday morning. Scanlon is
charged with vagrancy.
Bisbee officers have been looking
ior Mickey, the king pin of the L
W. W., for the past two weeks, re
ports having been eminating 'during
that time that he was in this city.
They ran into him in Erewery Gulch
yesterday morning and walked him
to headquarters In Jig time where
he was placed in a cell. An hour
later he furnished bail.
Scanlon has just got out of a peck
of trouble in Nevada, according to, re
ports from that state. He was ar
raigned in Tonopah on a charge of
criminal syndicalism, being extra
dited from Globe. The charges
flashed in the pan, however, and
Mickey left the state after posting a
$2,000 bond.
His departure was of an ungrace
ful nature in that a delegation of de

story, took him in an automobile at
Goldfield and dropped him 30 miles
out in the desert. He then worked
his way back to Phoenix.

Quick action on the part of dancers

have been va serious fire Saturday
night. One of the large bulbs under
the skylight exploded through some
unknown reason and flames were
lapping along the woodwork until
some one threw the switch. A bucket

Over 700 couples were witnesses-
of the explosion and there were many

WALLACE VS. M'MANUS ON 22ND;
LOUGHREY VS. CHAMBERS, 20TH;
RIVAL CLUBS BILL FIGHTS
Bisbee boxing "fans" -will be
offered two cards within three
days, both with attractive main
events, unless the situation exist
ing yesterday does not change
before the 22d. The two main
events will be Loughrey vs.
Chambers, to be given at the
Warren ball park on September
20, and Otto Wallace vs. Al Mc
Manus, at the Warren ball park
September 22.
This superfluity of fights is due
to a desire on the part of Lough
rey's friends to cee him fight
Chambers again and the insist
ence of the Warren District Ath
letic club that it shall have the
ball park for the 22d. Ever since
he was defeated by Chambers in
a ten-round decision here three
weeks ago, Loughrey has been
tryin gto get a return engage
ment, confident that he can take
the measure of the First cavalry
mam Saturday sheriff James McDon
ald, one of Loughrey's admirers,
who has been trying to get a re
turn date for, the Philadelphia
'bear cat," interviewed J. G.
Cowen superintendent of the
Warren-Bisbee street railway, and
obta:ned permission to use the
park on the night of the 22d.
The Warren: District Athletic
club, which has been handling the
boxing "game" In Bisbee, had in-: ,
tended to hold a fight on the 22d
at the ball park, but had not yet
arranged its card ivhen the sher
iff reserved the park from Mr.
Cowen.
Yesterday Mr. Cowen notified
Sheriff McDonald that the park
was claimed by the Warren Dis
trict Athletic club for tne 22d, but
that the sheriff coulcr have It any
other night.' Arrangements were
then made to give the Loughrey
Chanbers fight on the night of
the 20th at the park.
esterday George. B. Winfrey an
nounced that the Warren District
Athletic club had signed Otto
Wallace and Al McManus for
their main event on the night of
the V.2d. Both are clever light
weights. They will weigh in at
133 pounds on the afternoon of
the fight. The preliminaries have
not, yet been arranged. Wallace
recently got the decision over
Tommy Carter at El Paso in 15
louuds. He has fought some of
the best boys in the southwest,
including Cheney, morpe and
Bobby Waugh. McManus also
has a strong following He de
feated De Motte at Tucson the
other night, no ,.
Mr. Winfrey said some classy
preliminary events were now be
ing arranged and that the card
would be up to the usual stand
ard. Meantime Sheriff McDonald, O.
S. French. . and Johnny Twomey
are going ahead with the Lough-rey-Chambers
fight. Chambers
has agreed to the terms and prob
ably will sign up tae articles to
day. Loughrey will tram at Ft.
Huachuca. 1
;.Tbe outcome of the controversy
over the use of the Warren ball
park will be that the American
Legion will handle the bouts in
future. They have ad a com
mittee out the past few days in
terviewing the boxing "fans" and
both rival clubs have expressed
a willingness to turn over the
boxing matches to .the ex-soldiers.
Sheriff McDonald offered to
hafc e the legion handle the Cham-beKs-Loughrey
fight, but the le
g'.on told the sheriff to go ahead
with It and tney would take over
the fights hereafter.
That is the way the Situation
stood last night, although there
may be a radical change today.
Sheriff McDonald said his only
ai.n in taking a hand in the fight
game was to get. Loughrey a
chance to fight Chambers again,
as the Warren District club was
unwilling to do so at this time.

TOO RECKLESS WITH FIREARMS
WHILE we do not agree with the opinion of our county attorney
that bootlegging is a '"respectable crime", as revealed in one
of his letters, asking a parole for a man convicted on that
charge, we do' think that in many quarters the officers are
displaying a little toe much zeal in trying to round up this .class ot
offenders.
The other day at Omaha, a policeman shot and killed a hotel bell
boy, who ran when he was caught with a bottle of liquor. At Denver,
the chief of detectives who had killed a suspected "bootlegger", was
waylaid and murdered. Several ' booze" runners have been shot by
officers along the Colorado-Wyoming boundary line, and in Chicago
scarcely a day goes by without one or more persons engaged in the
liquor traffic being killed. Pima county deputies some time agu
shot into an automobile while they were hunting for "bootleggers"
and killed an innocent woman.
In England they recognize the tendency, of officers to be too free
with their weapons, and the uniformed "bobby" is not allowed to car
ry even a night stick, let alone a gun.
The fact of the matter is that. "gunmen" too often are placed
on our police forces or appointed as deputy sheriffs because of their
quickness on the trigger. The man who has a reputation as a "dead
shot" is generally willing to display his skill whenever the opportunity
offers.
In this country "gun toting" is a common practice and our officers
must for tlielr own protection go armed. But in selecting policemen
and deputies,, extreme care Bhould be exercised that they are men ot
cool, judgment who will not shoot unless it is absolutely necessary
and who, when it does become necessary, can Ehoot straight.
"Bootlegging" is not a killing offense. The record of Cochise
county is one on which the officers should be congratulated. A
"bootlegger" escapes now and then, it is true, but we think public
opinion will uphold the officer who lets one get away now rather '
than kill him.
Prohibition in the long run will justify itself, but if officers
whose duty it is to enforce the law are not a little less reckless with
their "shooting irons" there is sure to be a disastrous reaction.
AS LITTLE WORK AS POSSIBLE
IN testifying at Douglas, Arizona, in the hearing of some 200 Co
chise county residents, charged with kidnapping in connection with
the deportation at Bisbee in 1917, one laborer, a witness for the '
state, testified he took part in the Bisbee strike because he believed in
the motto: "Get as much as you can; get as short hours as you can
and work as little as you can." ,
That is the motto of too many people today, the world over, says
the El Paso Herald. Living up to it is what is the matter with thct
factories of Russia and Germany and played havoc with the collieries,'
and shipyards of England for a time during the war.
In this country it is responsible for lowered production and the
highest cost of production in our history. It has been and still is a
very important factor in the high cost of living.
Getting the highest pay for the least possible work in the least
possibla hours means dawdling through a short hour day witr little
accomplished at the enq of it, the hope being that the employer will
be forced, to order overtime, at rates even higher, to catch up with
his orders for goods.
A motto like that is harmful to industry asd to the public. It is
most harmful to the worker himself, for living up to it, he may pro
fit temporarily, but he will never rise very high. He need never
hope to become superintendent of the plant or general manager of
the firm. He shackles his feet bo he can't climb.
THE SENATE'S NINE PATRIOTS
(Boston Transcript) ,
THE nine senators who voted for the Lodge amendment restoring
Shantung to China are nine patriots, who if they stand together
will supply a leadership that tima and events will soon show to
be invincible. Let us call the roll and keep the names of the illustri
ous nine before us, and take heart in the courage that enabled these
senators in a great crisis to forget self and serve America:
Henry Cabot Lodge of Massachusets, chairman.
William Edgar- Porah of Idaho.
Frank B. Brandegee of Connecticut.
Albert B. Fall of New Mexico.
Philander C. Knox of Pennsylvania.
Warren G. Harding of Ohio.
Hiram W. Johnson of California.
Harry S. New of Indiana. ' ...... --r --
George S. Moses of New Hampshire.
In the years to come it will bo remembered of these nine senators
that neither threats from the White House nor whispers from the
Wall street could budge them from their duty to America and that
they called Japan's bluff in Shantung.
THE CAUTIOUS FARMER j
AN cbserving citizen says that fewer farmers than city people
get mixed up in railroad accidents when they are driving auto
mobiles. His explanation is interesting.
"You know," he says, "country folk always used to drive up to
railroad crossing, look at the historic sign displayed in those days,
and obediently 'stop, lock and listen." They would bring the'r horses
to a full stop berore crossing the tracks.
"This old system is changed. Generally, now, there is a sign
several hundred feet from the track, reading, 'Slow down.' It says
nothing about stopping. The result is that a city autoist meets a
ffast trai t on the crossing. The farmers are more cautious. They
still cling to the old practice and 'stop, look, and listen' before they
cross."
Evidently there ought to be a change in this modern system of
warnings, or else the city motorist ought to condescend to learn safe
' d ill vilai i qiet hods' from; his rural brethen. ,
"LaFollette heads paper Inquiry," says a news item. And when
it comes down to brass tacks, aren't the inquiries mostly paper, no
matter who heads them?
Anybody who thinks that soda water is not a lit object for a
luxury tax must have paid littlo attention to the present price of
ice cream sodas.

J. D. A. Morrow Tells Senate
Commmittee Such a Combina
tion Would Be Impossible.
GOVERNORS JOIN WILSON IN H. C L. FIGHT
PRICE" AT MINES
LOWER THAN LAST YEAR
Better Grades of Coal Have Advanced
But Lower Grades Decline, Making
Average of All Grades Less.
Washington (Special). A combina-
nuu mining Duumiuuus nnu uinui"io
to .maintain or fix prices does not ex
ist and would be Impossible if attempt
ed, J. D. A. Morrow, vice president of
the National Coal Association, told the
Senate Subcommittee in its first day's
inquiry here Into the coal situation-..
Prices at the mine, Mr. Morrow added,
have declined under the competition
which prevails and are lower now than
they were a year ago.
"There are about f,000 separate com
mercial producers operating approxi
mately seven thousand mines, ' from
which bituminous coal is regularly
shipped," Mr. Morrow said. "In addi
tion there are some two thousand op
erators with about three thousand
mines, who begin producing and sell
ing coal whenever the price goes up a
little and offers a profit to theiu. Thus
in 1917 coal production was reported
to the United States Geological Survey
from 10,034 mines. Moreover, there
are hundreds of thousands of acres of
coal lands along railroads on which
new mines can be readily and quickly
opened by anyone so disjwtsed.
, "Such a condition obviously does not
lend itself to restrictive combinations
among producers. In addition the op
erators of each mining field are sub
ject to competition from the produc
ers of other fields, so that buyers
have many different sources of supply
available to them.
"Anyone who alleges that there is
a nation-wide combination among bi
tuminous coal producers when these
ore the conditions of bituminous coal
production 'mid distribution, merely ad
vertises his own ignorance or convicts
himself of deliberate and vicious mis
statements. . i . . .
'Of the five thousand separate bi
tuminous con I producers In the United
States, 2.-Jt-l, approximately 43 per
cent, hold membership In the National
Coal Association. They produce about'
00 per cent of the total output of bi
tuminous coal in 'the country.
"Charges that the National Coal As
sociation is a combination to maintain
prices are without foundation in' fact;
they doubtless proceed simply from ig
norance of its purposes and activities.
The National Coal Association neither
liuys nor sells coal ; neither- does it
liave anything whatever to do with the
prices which its members ask or sell
ait. nor with Ike territory into which
tley 'ship their coal nor the quantity
which they produce." .
Mr. Morrow stated .that bituminous
coal prices have declined since the
armistice, and in general are lower
than the pr.Ves fixed by the United
Slates Fijel administration. lie sub
mitted charts to the committee graph-it-ally
showing the prices which bitum
inous coal sold at the mines in differ
ent districts of the United States from
April 1 to August 1, 1910. In connec
tion with these charts, Mr. Morrow ex
plained that when the price restric
tions of the fuel administration were
removed on Feb. 1 last, the better,
more desirable coals went to a pre
mium in the open competitive market
and the less desirable coals declined In
price. ,
This was the action to be expected,
he said in a market where the buyer
exercises his choice and can obtain the
kind he prefers. As a result. Instead
of the uniform prices In different dis
tricts, which were fixed by the United
States Fuel administration, prices
promptly spread out, some coal going
higher and some lower than they had
been.
"Meantime," Mr. Morrow said, "the
cost of producing bituminous coal is'
higher now than it was a year ago, due
to the fact that the mines then were
operating six days a week, and in
many cases now are operating only
four days per week, and In some' cases
only three days per week. The over
head expense of maintaining mines
goes on just the same whether coal Is .
produced or not. These Idle-day ex
penses have resulted In Increased costs
per ton, as compared with last year.
Vhen these Increased costs are consid
ered in connection with the. general de
crease In prices, it I clear that profits
of bituminous coal operators are ma
terially less than a year nun."
Referring to statements by Repre
sentative ITudd'oston of Alalonui. Di
rector General Ilines of the Riroad
Administration nnd others to the ef
fect that bituminous coal prices at ths
mines are unduly high, Mr. Morrow
said:
"I wish to deny publicly and emplint
Ically these allegations that blfuin'iious
coal prices are being maintained in
me Improper manner nnd are unduly
li!gh. I am convinced that thes state
ments proceed simply from a lack of
understanding of the facts."
Mr. Morrow drew comparisons be
tween the. prices of bituminous coals
nt the mines in the United States and
foreign countries.
"Prices at the mines in Great I'.rit
ain," he said, "are ahouo three tiiv.es
the mine prices prevalent in the
United States; in Franco the mine
prices are more titan tlire and n half
times those of the United States. Kn'g
Ifsh mine prices 'range from :''.!4 to
fT.14 per ton, while bituminous coal in
France )a costing about JS.Tt? per ton
at the mines. The average mine price
of bituminous coal sold in the United
States is in the neighborhood of $2.40
per ton."

WAR AbAINST
INTERVENTION
Patience Urged On
Bisbee Buyers of

Continued from Page One
erature aimed to quiet any demand
for intervention by the United States
in the southern republic. Dr. Inman
I told the committee that American oil
companies were expending large sums
of money in an attempt to obtain in
tervention, but under cross-examination
said he recently had been told
that the oil interests were 'opposed
to intervention.
Carranza Man of Honor
Dr. Inman told the committee that
in his opinion President Carranza was
a man of honor and integrity and
that he had strong faith in the abil
ity of Mexico to work out Its own
problems if given friendly assistance
by the United States. He deprecated
intervention, adding that it would
stun the growth of carefully culti
vated pan-AAmerican ideas.
Bishop James Cannon, of the Meth
odist Episcopal church, South, fol
lowed Inman with the assertion that
the only intervention advisable in
Mexico was.hat of the church and
school.
During the cross-examination which
followed his testimony, Inman was
subjected to sharp questioning by
Senator Brandegee, Connecticut. He
many times admitted that he was un
able to give the committee details
of charges which he had made, and
at his request will be permitted to t ery Gulch
appear again. i The man
Senator Called Carranza Enemy
Inman was questioned concerning
several articles put out by his asso
ciation, many of which he said were
written by L. J. Debekker. OOne of
the articles called to his attention
was entitled "The Truth About Mex
ico," and referred to the investigating
sub-committee as "headed by that no
torious enemy of Carranza, Senator
Fall." The witness was unable 'o
give the name of the author of the
article.
A letter which Chairman Fall said
was written and circuiatea dv inman
contained a "riot call" to friends of
Mexico to do what they could to pre
vent armed intervention in Mexico,
saying that such action was imminent
and charging that a deliberate effort
was being made to cause congress to
take such action.
"Few More Raids" Hinted
Another letter noted said that
"when the country had waked up a
little more, it wouid be easy to pull
off a few raids, as already had been,
done." i
"What do you mean by that?' de
manded Senator Fall.
For an hour the witness fenced
with Senator Fall and Senator Bran
deges, before they,, secured from him
anything but an evasion.- Senator
Fall insisted upon knowing if he re
ferred to the oil interests as the con
text appeared to indicate that. Dr,
Inman replied that he did not and
sioke of what had been printed in
newspapers.
Would Pan for Protection
Both Senators Brandegee and Fall
were particularly insistent that he be
more specific regarding charges that
the "amount of money being spent
by the oil companies for propaganda
is appalling." He was unable to give
any exact data but quoted Mr. Debek
ker as saying they were maintaining
two offices at New York and Wash
ington well furnished and that large
numbers of agents were employed.
- Patience over the delay of the gov
ernment in delivering the army sur
plus stores ordered by parcel post was
yesterday urged onisbee purchasers
by Assistant Postmaster Pressly.
"El Paso is supplying the groceries
oraerea as rase as tney can, ne as
serted, "but they can send only what
they have in stock and as a large num
ber of goods are not yet available, we
have no complete orders to date,
When these are received we will noti
iy the purcnasers so that they may
call and get them at once. We will
deliver nothing however, until the
full order is in."
Mr. Pressly reported so far that
only nine cases of goods had been re
ceived. These are all syrup and
hominy, according to the postmaster,
and constitute only part orders.
Mexican Nabbed As
Hotel Sneak Thief
The first of an alleged long delayed
list of captures of the sneak thief
fraternity who have been making
merry about various Bishee rooming
houses was made yesterday when a
Mexican giving his name as Ysobel
Corona, was taken into custody. He
is charged with the theft of $144 in
cash and two suits of clothes from
j the Hill Top roomiag house on Brew-
was arrested on a war
rant issued on the complaint of Car
los Villareal, the victim, Villareal
said that the value of the -clothing
taken was over $70.
Numerous prowlers have been do
ing a land office business about Bis
bee hotels and rooming houses in the
past month and it is the hope of the
police that in Coroua they may have
a capjure who can throw some light
on a number of other petvy robberies.

juvenile ladies of the choru3.
Two special features of welcome
were added to the program. "shortly
after the general arrived, a cartoonist
set the house cheering arresh when
he threw on the screen a welcome to
General Pershing, which he followed
with a portrait of the general and a
picture of a big St. Bernard dog "for
the little general."
Later, during a '"flower scene," the
filmty clad nymphs of an "aerial bal
let" flew over General ersning's box
and dropped a laurel wreath.
The crowd which greeted Gen. Per
shing as he lef the theater was even
greater than that which had greeted
him upon his arrival, and defied po
lice effort sto check in the rush to get
close to the general's car. General
Pershing acknowledged the cheers
with a smile and a wave of his cap,
rising from his seat and bowing as
the automobile moved through the
crowd.

2 Dividend
announcements come from.r
-Gilbert-True Oil Go,
r
The latest sensation
among the Texa3 Oil Stocks
was the announcement made
by the Gilbert-True Oil Com
pany last week that their
INITIAL DIVIDEND WOULD
BE 5 PER CENT and would
be paid on September 25th
and that in October they
would pay a 10 PER CENT
CASH DIVIDEND,-; and that
thereafter their dividends
would "be paid monthly.
GILBERT-TRUE is known
as a Dunbar & Company
.stock. The announcing of
this big dividend places the
company as another Dunbar
& Company success.
OUR OTHER SUCCESSES
SILVER CYCLE, which
brought in a gusher, and will
pay a handsome dividend
soon. OCEAN OIL, -which
we advised the purchase or
at 90 cents, now selling at
above 52.00. RANGER
BURK, which our clients
bought at $1.00, now selling
at $1.75 with three wells on
the sand.' RANGER-CENTRAL,
which our clients
bought as low as S5 cents,
now selling at $1.65. PRU
DE N T I A L PETROLEUM,
which our clients bought a?
around $1.00, now paying a
cash dividend of $1.34 on
each share.
WE OFFER SUBJECT TO
PRIOR SALE ANY PART
OF 10,000 SHARES GIL-
iL, M H EKT-TK UE AT $2.00 A
SHARE, (with our guarantee
that you will participate !n
the September dividend if
jjyour order is received at
once.)
YOU SHOULD BUY GILBERT-TRUE
NOW.
BECAUSE The Company
has a 5-acre lease in Block
97, which is known as the
TEXAS CHIEF OFFSET
(the Texas Chief came in
a 7,000-barrel well, and there
isn't any reason why the
Gilbert-True will not bring In
a gusher on this lease.)
THE GILBERT-TRUE OIL
COMPANY has started oper
ations on this 5-acre lease
and guarantees to finish at
least one well.
This company has added to
Its holdings another produc
ing well in Turkburnett
which brings its total pro
duction, to date up to 4800
barrels, monthly. It. has also
! added to Its royalties a 5
acre interest in the royalty
on the 240-acre Roper tract
in the Ranger field.
One of the assets' of the
Company is a 3-acre full
royalty undivided on the
Norwood well, which is the
largest well in the Ranger
field. This Norwood tract
consists of 751 acres, and
the Texas Company, which
owns the lease, is under con
tract to drill 75 wells on this
tract, thus making this roy
alty owned by the Gilbert
True Oil Company almost
priceless in value. Tho GIL.
BERT-TRUE has one of the
lowest capitalization of any
of the big dividend payers
capitalization 150,000 shares,
par value $1.00.
PREDICTION
On the payment of the Sep
tember 25th dividend, we
predict a market on GILBERT-TRUE
of $4.00 a share.
On the payment of the Octo
ber dividend, we predict
$5.00 a share. On the bring
ing in of a gusher, in Block
97, adjoining the Texas Chief
the block that knows no fail
ureswe predict from $10.00
to $12.00 a share.
TEXAS CHIEF is today sell
ing on a basis of 12 to 1.

NEW YORK, Sept. 8. Stocks were
active and strong on the resumption

lapsed into dullness with a heavy un
dertone .owing mainly to the absence
of bullish incentiv.
The dealock in the steel situation
was again the chief deterrent. United

and 104 .closing at 103, unchanged
but allied shares, notably Crucible,
were inclined to strengthen later, fin
ishing mostly at gains.
Trading in rails was negligible.
Almost the only elements of consis
tent strength were provided by oils,
motors and shippings. Mexican Pe
troleum enlivened the later dealings
at an extreme advance of 12 points

LEASED WIRE
against a surprise in the government
crop report monopolized most of the
energy of corn traders today and with
good reason, for'tbe official estimate
of the 191i cop was much more bear
ish than had been generally looked
for. The market closed weak 1 to
16-JsC net lower with September
$1.62?4 and December $1.31 to 1$.31.
Oatc gained Vi, to c. In provis
ions the outcome was a setback of
72c to jf2.25.
Throughout the greater part of the
day, dealers in corn devoted them
selves to ;iosing out open contracts
so as to bo prepared for whatever the
government report might contain.
Private reportB had given no basis for
any raoicai cnange in the crop out-
look during August, but such impor-
anproachiiiK when heaglng sales exer
cise more or lean of R creclsfrte Influ
ence. , ;
Cr rrect anticipation that the gov
ernment report as to oats would favor
the bulls tended to strengthen oats.
Absence of demand, either domestic
or export, lead to a sharp breaks in
provisions.

Moon, Sunday afternoon. Although
the evidence at the present time
against Moon is wholly circumstan
tial, the sheriff says that he is con
vinced that he has one of the right
men, at any rate .
Another point of . interest that came
to light yesterday in conection with
the robbery", was the discovery that
an attempt had been made Saturday
night to chisel the lock on a side door
of the Overlock brokerage offices
near by. The top of the knob In
which a Yale lock is set was found
pried almost of r. The same persons
are suspected.
No attempt has been made as yet to
get the man Moon to talk. Besides
the cut on his right hand and the
apparent similarity of his finger
prints and those in the blood on the
safe door, the young man has the
handicap of having been known , ac
cording to officers, tohave been jailed
for' burglary in Pnoenix some time
Hgo. They also claim that a small
piece of skin formed on one of the
tools fits a scraped spot on Moon's
hand. Following his arrest the offi
cers .took him to the dispensary
where it was said the cut had been
one f.hat bled very freely.
It is, however, pointed out in favor
of the accused, that he had no money
on his person when he was followed
to Lowell and taken into custody, by
Sheriff McDonald and Officer Gilpin.
It is the theory of the officers that
at least three men had a hand in
the Saturday night job two inside,
and one lookout. That they were
clumsy hands, was shown by the way
in which the safe was forced with
chisels and meat cleavers.
The police believe that the burglars
were persons who were familiar witn
the locality and the market habits.
Men had been working recently in
the cold storage plant in the back
of the Treu shop late at night, ham
mering and repairing pipes. The
burglars took this into account when
rear door and not through a window
as was first supposed.
Justice Allison issued a formal ar
rest charging Moon, the suspect, with
first degree 'burglary late yesterday
afternoon but the man will not be
arraigned in all probability until a
more thorough investigation has been
made.
