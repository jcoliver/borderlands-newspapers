"At about 6 o'clock Sunday morning
nine automobiles carrying armed of

"A member of the party, stepping
forward, announced he was the Ger

the Dutch sentry replied the kaiser
could not pass until he had orders to

"And so the party waited, the for-

onlookers. At 7 o'clock the party went
through the formalities of intern

COMMISSION MAY
GUIDE NATION IN
RECONSTRUCTION
President Plans to Appoint
Small Board of Experts to
Bring Country From War
Basis to Peace
(By Review Leased Wire)
WASHINGTON. Nov. 13. PresI
dent Wilson has under consideration
the aDuolntment of a reconstruction
commission to develop a comprehen
slve program for the nation' conver
sion from a war to a peace Dasia
Th commission would be - advisory
rather than executive in functions and
the plans developed and co-ordinated
c- prvivFqibyit would be carried out by exist-
E. KtVIVfcO anil
Ing government departments ana
agencies.
As now considered the commission
would be representative of commer
cial, Industrial, labor, agricultural ana
social interest; its membership wouiu
be small and It would deal with all
phases of the great problems of eas
ing the country from war to peace.
The president is understood to op
pose the plan of a congressional com
mittee preparing a reconstruction pro
gram. He Is said to prefer men wad
can give their entire time to the work
and who have made special studies
of economic and social problems. Tba
president is Bald now to be consider
ing what emergency legislation may
be necessary before the government
can proceed systematically to turn all
resources of the country to peace
time production.
How to shut off further war produc
tion without closing plants, throwing
men out of work and causing finan
cial strain, is the most immediate re
construction problem facing the gov
ernment. Hundreds of telegrams of
inquiry reaching government depart
ments today disclosed anxiety of busi
ness men over this question and
offered many suggestions. Aa a clear
ing house for such, suggestions the re
construction commission would act.
Establishment of such a board was
recommended to President Wilson by
Prof. O. M. W. Sprague, an economist
tf Harvard, who has conducted recon
struction research work for the coun
cil of national defense. Government
authorities having charge of the plac
ing of war contracts are considering
a plan for diverting raw materials
from war industries as fast as these
curtail their activities, to other In
dustries where they can be used at
once for reconstruction needs. War
orders will not be cancelled in a
wholesale way until such a plan is
developed, it is believed.
In this connection the chamber of
commerce of the United States today
made public a letter to President Wil
son citing evidence of anxiety among
business men over the government's
future course, suggesting development
of uniform policies tor all depart
ments, and some measures for pre
venting a sudden drop, in prices of
raw materials.
"It seems, to us," the letter said
among other things, 'that it Is pos
sible to work out certain common
principles which should obtain In all
government departments in affecting
settlements on contracts now to be
stopped and adjusting them on a fair
basis. If one bureau, or department, '
follows Its own ideas, another pursues
a different course, it seems that it
will lead to endlesscontroversy and
confusion. For this reason, we be
lieve, the agencies set up in the vari
ous bureaus and departments to deal
with the question should be controlled
by some common authority in order
to prevent great difficulty."
The chamber of commerce also has
recommened to the president the ea-
tabllshment of an advisory reconstruc
tion commission similar to that he
now considers appointing.
Whatever opportunity may be given
for supervising the transition. It Is
considered certain that the govern
ment purpose to maintain a -centralized
control. .

CASUALTIES OF
FORCE HOT TO
EXCEEJH00J1
Now Seems Improbable That
Total of Americans Killed,
Wounded, Missing Will
Exceed That Figure
(By Review Leased WlreJ
WASHINGTON, Nov. 13. Offi
cials here estimate that the total
casualties of the American ex
peditionary forces in the war will
not exceed 100,000. including the
men killed in action, wounded,
died of wounds, disease and acci
dents and the missing who never
will be accounted for . Some of
those who have been missing
probably will be accounted for
when the prisoners are returned
from Germany.
It was satd today that it probably
will be several weeks before the rec
ord of casualties can be completed.
It Is regarded as almost certain that
many of the casualties in the recent
heavy fighting by the first and second
American armies have not yet been
reported. Lists also must be com
piled of unreported American casual
ties In British and French hospitals,
especially from among . the United
States forces . brigaded with allied
units. Deaths -from wounds also prob
ably will be reported for some time
while lists of slightly woumled being
sent by couriers may be delayed.
The dally lists for several days
have consisted of approximately 1100
names daily. Secretary Baker has In
dicated that a considerable number
of reported casualties remain to be
given out but that these would be
released as rapidly as newspapers can
handle them.
An unofficial tabulation of pub
lished casualty lists, including those
of November 12, shows a grand total
of 71,390 men. Careful estimates
made today, based on knowledge of
the battle conditions faced by the
first and second armies tn the days
Immediately preceding cessation of
hostilities and on the average here
tofore lead us to believe that all un
published and unreported casualty will
not exceed 30.000.
Estimates based nn previous rec
ords fix the total marine casualties in
France at less than 5000.

GENERAL STAFF WORKING
(By Review Leased Wire)
WASHINGTON. Nov. 13. Plans
for the reorganization of the war
department and the army now are
in formulation by the general staff
and soon will be before Secretary
Baker. Orders for the actual
breaking up of the army canuot be
promulgated until these plans are
completed as the demobilization
program is dependent to some ex
tent upon the adoption of a reor
ganization policy.
The secretary has indicated new leg
islation will be necessary to carry out
the reorganization and Is expected to.
lay a definite program before con
gress at the earliest potssibib tuoment.
Existing law authorizes the main
tenance of a regular army of approxi
mately 350,000 men. While it is not
possible to forecast the number of
American troops that must be em
ployed to forecast the peace treaties
have been signed, military, men be
lieve the authorized regular estab
lishment cannot provide an absolute
force for all purposes at home and
abroad.
Of the 3,700,000 men now under
arms, probably not more than 100.000
are tinder obligation to serve beyond
the iestoration.of peace. There were
7000 officers and about 120,000 men in
the ,regular army when war was de
clared. Expiration of enlistments,
however, probably has served to re
duce this considerably and all war
time enlistments are for the war per
iod only.
Thousands of the officers now in
service are on temporary commisisons
in thq regular establishment. These
commissions were issued for a definite
period of years and the men might
be held, although the general attitude
of the department would not Indicate
any intention of holding such officers
against their will when the war emerg
ency has passed.
Tie number of men necessary to be
maintained in Europe probably will
be worked out by General Pershing's
staff and since similar calculations for
the United States and Its possessions
are being made here it is expected
that the size of the army for which
it will be necessary to provide soon
will be arrived at.
The general staff's recommenda
tions as to the way the army is to be
formed are expected to embody the
principle of universal military train
ing. A bill prepared by the staff just
before the United States entered the
war outlined the general scheme
which Is likely to be again advocated,
modified In the light of war experi
ence and the results of the operation
of the selective draft system.
At this time it was planned to con
tinue the garrisons for the Philippines.
Hawaii and Panama on a voluntary
basis of sclenting men who elected
army life after they had passed
through their periods of training. Out
side of these overseas forces, however,
the staff proposed to remodel the
standing army into a strictly training
force, composed of officers and.non
commlBlsoned officers who should be
developed into experts in getting raw
material quickly into shape and
through whose hands. In future years,
should pass the classes called to the
colors for training.
Both the commissioned and non
commissioned ranks of this training
force, it was planned,' should be re
cruited from men who displayed abil
ity during their training. There is
reason to expect that some similar pro
ject will again be brought forward al
though neither President Wilson nor
Secretary Baker is now committed to
universal training as a national policy.
In his last annual report Mr. Baker
said it was not a questfon which
should be decided while the country
was at war.
Demobilization of the existing offic
ers corps, both line and staff, forms a
separate element of the present prob
lems of the war department. It is
certain that efforts will be made to
keep men who have shown themselves
qualified in such relationship with the
government that their services con be
quickly re-secured at need. Pending
the completion of plans, resignations
are being discouraged.

NEW YORK, Nov. 13. Contribu
tions by the entire country to the

today totalled $45,213,139, according
to a statement at national headquar
ters here tonight.
It was pointed out by Dr. John R

rate of $40,000,000 to reach the 60

Although officials at national head
quarters expressed some solicitude at
the showing of the country as a whole
thus far, the day's news was cheering,
they said. Three states have attained
their quotas and now are striving for
the desired surplus. New York state
has outstripped all the others. The
total reported at noon including New

(By Review Leased Wire)
WASHINGTON, Nov. 13 Pres
ident Wilson was said today to
have given no indication as to
how he regards the suggestions
from high sources in Europe that
he attend the great conference
which is to re-establish the peace
of a war-torn world.
Most of the president's advisers,
however, are understood to consider
that the acceptance of invitations
would involve needless risk and would
serve no purpose that could not be
accomplished through the delegates
who will be appointed to represent
the American government and who
will be in constant communication
with Washington. Should the presi
dent decide to attend the conference
and some of those unually well-informed
say he has an open mind on
the subject that fact would not mean,
in the belief here, that Secretary
Lansing would not be a member of
theAmerican delegation. It was said
that upon Mr. Lansing would fall
much of the weight of the heavy
tasks connected with American par
ticipation in the conference, not only
by virtue of his high rank, but also,
because of his wide experience in
other International conferences and
arbitrates.
The proposal of Dr. Sotf, the Ger
man foreign secretary, for a prelim
inary peace conference, had not reach
ed Washington in official form to
night, but it is understood there is
little probability of its acceptance.
Such a conference Is regarded here"
as unnecessary and as likely to com
plicate uselessly the work of the gen
eral conference when It is held.
Ostensibly Dr. Solfs proposal Is
based upon the urgent need of Ger
many for food and other supplies, but
It is pointed out that these conditions
will be dealt with by the United
States and the allies In advance of
the peace conference under the gen
eral pledges contained iu the armis
tice and given by the supreme war
council at Versailles.
Further assurance on this subject U
given by the supreme war council at
Versailles.
Further assurance on this subject
Is given the German government by
Secretary Lansing, who, in a note
handed today to the Swiss minister,
in reply to one from Frederirh Ebert,
the German chancellor said the presi
dent Is ready to consider favorably
the supplying of foodstuffs to Ger.
many and to take up the matter with
the allied governments upon assur
ance that public, order will be main
tained in Germany and an equitable
distribution of the food is guaranteed.
In some quarters here it Is suspec
ted that Dr. Solfs real purpose is to
have the preliminary conference dis.
pose of political matters, such as the
future of the German colonies and
trade relations between the central
powers and the nations with which
they bad been at war. In the hope of
being able thus speedily to re-establish
German, foreign trade.
AH of the old treaties of amity be
tween the warring nations, have beea
destroyed automatically by the war
and It will be necessary to provide a
whole new fabric of trade treaties.
The peace conference may signify
its. own ideas as to how these shall
be framed, but It will remain for the

The supreme war council in Ver
sailles, did more than consider the
subject of armistice, and it is now
learned that for a long time preced
ing the final collapse of the central ,
powers much study and attention was
given to the subject of a final peace
in all its ramifications.
Therefore, when the peace confer
ence meets it will find before it a
fairly well digested program for the
conduct of its business, calculated to
keep the sessions well within bounds
not only in the matter of expenditure
of time, but also in the range of sub
jects to be discussed. Owing to the
number of questions to be considered
and the amount of original investiga
tion required to arrange final settle
ments of many of them, it is expected
tnat soon after convening the peace
conference will divide the delegates
into a number of sub-committees to
deal with different branches of the
work and it is regarded here as cer- j
tain that it will provide for appoint

at Vienna, according to dispatches
from that city. One of the features
was to be a great demonstration in

where U;e national convention was
sitting.

tngineer, and once while li.'tiaj, he in
jured himself with a pk-cecf heavy ma
chinery, across ths cbdotj:n. He was
so sore he could not bear to prrss on
! himself at a!!, on chest or abdo.nen, He
weighed 1C5 lbs., and fell olf until he
weighed 110 lbs., in two weeks.
He became constipated and it looked
like he would die. We had thr:e different
doctors, yet with all their; ml 2'xir.e, his
bowels failed toact'.'Ke would turn up
a ten-cent bottle of castor oil, and drink
it two or three days in succession. He
did this yet without result. We became
desperate, he suffered so. He was swol-
! ten terribly. He told me his suffering
I could only be described as torture.
I sant and bought Thedford's Black

and when it began to act he fainted, he

Dollars For Doughnuts
The dollars you give in the united war
work campaign may be spent for dough
nuts ; a part of them surely will be invested
in the festive "floater." You may say it
could be better spent.
, Take the case of Mrs. Edith Knowles,
of Phoenix, Arizona for many years an
intimate friend of the queen of Rumania,
linguist," acquainted with every nook and
corner of Europe, for several years past a
resident of this state, now in France. She
was one of the first American women to be
sent overseas for Y. M. C A. canteen work.
She has been on nearly every front in
f France and Belgium, and she has worked
in many huts. A few days ago she was
mentioned in dispatches for bravery at the
front. - -
Mrs. Knowles spent her days and nights
making doughnuts. With two other wo
men, unmindful of danger, she works in
the front line trenches. Each day these
three women turn out 1 0,000 doughnuts
"sinkers" for the privates. She could spend
her time in huts to the rear of the guns
and gas and flames; but she prefers to be
near the front where she can be of great
est aid in cheering the men.
Mrs. Knowles knows that" the nearest
way to man's heart is through his stom
ach. Mrs. Knowles fries doughnuts for
doughboys, and the dollars you give for the
united war work campaign will assist Mrs.
Knowles reach the hearts of more Ameri
can soldiers. -
Give your dollars for doughnuts.
THE ORDER CHANGETH
(Globe Record.)
The election of Thomas E. Campbell,
the republican candidate for governor, ap
pears to be borne out by the lastest reports
emanating from Phoenix. The claims of
the democratic state committee on behalf
of Fred T. Colter, the democratic candi
date,, have abated, until the figures repre
senting the committee's estimate of Col
ter's plurality are approaching the vanish
ing point, and it is now generally believed
that the official canvass of votes cast
throughout the state in the election last
Tuesday will confirm Mr. Campbell's elec
tion by a substantial plurality, leaving no
grounds for a contest.
The belief still widely maintains that Mr.
Campbell was fairly elected two years ago.
as the official canvass of the vote showed,
and afterward confirmed by the superior
court of Maricopa county, notwithstanding
the final decision by the supreme court
seating Hunt, rendered nearly eleven
months after Governor Campbell was
elected in 1916 brought to his support last
Tuesday many independent voters. Several
. other factors contributed to the result of
the late election, any one of which should
have been sufficient to have caused the
defeat of Mr. Colter. ,
Mr. Colter as a member of the third leg
islature which increased the salary of the
governor, was ineligible to election by rea
son of the prohibitive clause in the 6tate,
constitution, which he and his advisers ig
nored. Also, he had affiliated with the
Hunt faction and was naturally recognized
as the Hunt candidate; and finally, the
disclosures in the trial of the Breen libel
suit, in which Governor Hunt by his own
testimony admitted his 'association "with
and sympathy for members of the I. W. W..
and another enemy of the government
under indictment, caused many reputable
citizens to desert Colter and support Camp
bell in an effort to rid Arizona of Hunt
ism, which for six years has disgraced the
slate.
These are. in the main, the reasons for
Mr. Campbell's election, which was affect
ed by the votes of conservative democrats
and independents, of which Gila county
was by for the largest contributor of all the
political divisions of the state, Colter's plu
rality in this county being approximately
one thousand less than that given Hunt
two years ago.
The people look to Governor Campbell
to give them a clean and efficient admin
istration, and so far as he may be able
under existing laws and political condi
tions, an economical one. t He will have
many important and responsible positions
under the state government, to fill and his
appointments will be closely scrutinized.
The Record hopes and believes that he will
make good.
REHABILITATION OF OUR WOUNDED
The United States government is re
solved to do its best to restore every
wounded American soldier and sailor to
health, strength and self-supporting activ
ity. Until his discharge from the hospital, all
the medical and surgical treatment neces
sary to restore him to health is under the
jurisdiction of the military or naval auth
orities, according to the branch of the serv
ice he is in. The vocational training, the
reeducation and rehabilitation necessary to,
restore him to self-supporting activity, is
under the jurisdiction of the Federal Board
of vocational education.
If he needs an artificial limb orvme
f chanical appliance "the government will
Supply it free, will keep it in repair, and re
new it when necessary: If after his dis
charge he again needs medical treatment
on account of his disability, the govern
ment will supply it free. While he is in the
hospital and while in training afterwards
the soldier or sailor will receive compensa
tion as if in service and his family or de
pendents will receive their allotment.
A wounded soldier or sailor, although
his disability does not prevent him from
returning to employment without training,
can take a bourse of vocational training
free of cost and the compensation provided
by the war risk insurance act will be paid
to him and the training will be free, but no
allotment will be paid to his family.
Every Liberty bond holder who holds his
bond is keeping up a part of this great work
of restoring to health, strength and useful
ness the men who have suffered for their
country. .
With the passage of the British fleet
through the Dardanelles, there must come
a realization to all the world that the arm
istice terms enforced by the allies against
the former central powers, really are ac
complishing what they intended to. Where
the might of the allied arms, exerted for
many months, failed to open the way, the
terms of the. armistice enforced upon Tur
key cleared the passage. We read that
the British and Indian troops occupying
the strongly fortified positions, against
which the best soldiers of their nationality
formerly dashed themselves in vain, pa
raded as the fleet passed.
Problems of peace are succeeding those
of war, in the minds of our statesmen.
President Wilson now is contemplating the .
appointment of a commission whose sole
duty it shall be to work out details for the
resumption of peacetime activities by as
large a portion as possible of the people of
the country and as rapidly as possible. This
problem is one that may well engage the
best minds in the nation and the personnel
of such a committee doubtless will reflect
this view on the part. of the president.
It is a pity that so costly an error was
made by the health authorities, in issuance
of a premature announcement of the re
opening of schools, churches, motion pic
ture houses and other places of public as
sembly. Where the fault lay, we do not
know. However, it was a deep disappoint
ment to the general public when the state
health officer issued an order cancelling the
permission already given.
Reluctantly, but nevertheless surely, the
democratic state central committee is los
ing heart and though they have not reach
ed the point where they will admit Camp
bell's election, the Colter "majority" fig
ures grow smaller and smaller. Outside
the immediate committee it is admitted
freely by democrats that Campbell has
been elected and will be given the certifi
. cate that will entitle him to hold office.
The large number of people who persist
in putting their bonds in coupon form and
keeping them in their houses are often the
same ones who wonder why thieves are
unusually active this fall.

Douglas: Henry Hewitt died this
morning at 6 o'clock at the Calumet
hospital from injuries caused by a
horse falling with him yesterday. He
was employed as a cowboy at the
Stevens &. Hennessy ranch. The ac
cident occurred about 2 o'clock yes
terday afternoon and he was brought
to the hospital as quickly as possioie.
No bones were broken and a concus
sion of the brain was evidently the
cause of his death. He has two broth
era residing in Douglas and is very
well known here. The body was
taken to the Ferguson Undertaking
parlors and funeral arrangements will
be made later.
N Douglas: The friends of Attorney
David Benshimol are much gratified
at the show ing he made in his recent
race for attorney general of the state
against Wiley K. Jones, one of the
strongest democrats in the state. Ac
cording to the Phoenix Gazette, with
only three precincts uncounted, Mr.
Benshimol was less than 200 votes
bohlnd Mr. Jones, the count being
5S22 and f629. The Gazette says it
was one of the surprises of the elec
tion, as Mr. Benshimol Is compara
tively unknown in Maricopa county.
Mr. Benshimol also ran far ahead In
Cochise county of his fellow candi
dates on the state ticket.

Miyuel Webby, the West Congress

a charge ,of murdering Elius Ahuage,
the' Syrian peddler. The prisoner was
also known as M. I. Chiulu He has
been iu Tucson about two years and
at one time had a small store on West
Congress street. The sheriff believes

A CRIME TO BE REMEMBERED BY THOSE AT THE PEACE TABLE
mr.J
NEW YORK, Nov. 13 Peace and
its attendant uncertainties loomed '
larger on the finacial horizon today,
the stock market undergoing an
other period of liquidation which en
compassed nearly all parts of the ac
tive list.
The decline was accelerated by
further restriction of credits and the
attitude of conservative banking inter
ests who encouraged general curtail
ment of speculative accounts despite
the more hopeful views of leaders in
the steel industry. Speculative favor
ites were at lowest prices in the later
dealings, but rallied from fractions to
1V4 points on the support then ac
corded rails and shippings and the
further strength of Mexican Pe
troleum. United States Steel was again the
pivotal feature, its extreme decline of
1 pints to 9TT being quickly fol
lowed, however, by a ' rally in which
two-thirds of,the loss was regained.
Rails yielded 1 to 4 points at their
worst, Canadian Pacific displaying
actual weakness for a time, but in
this division losses were half way
repaired. Southern Pacific and Read
ing receiving support at recessions.
Coppers were heavy, oils and motors
irregular and specialties, fertilizers
excepted, mainly lower. Sales
amounted to 760,000 shares.
Bonds followed the trend of the
stock market. Liberty issues holding
steady, while railway and industrial
issues lost fractions to a point. Sales,
par value, aggregated $10,250,000. Old
United States bonds were unchan&ed
on call.
GRAIN MARKET.
CHICAGO, Nov. 13. Assurances
that food relief for Europe from
America would be systematically en
larged had a strengthening effect to
day on the corn market. Prices closed
firm, 1 to 2c higher, with December
l.HVt to 1.19, and January 1.20 to
1.21. Oats gained to 1 cent. In
provisions the result varied from b
cents decline to $1 advance.
Upturns in the value of corn took
place almost simultaneously with the
receipts of advices that President
Wilson had sent word to Germany of
an intention to extend to the people
of the central European countries
thoroughly organized help toward sub
sistence. With this promise in view,
buyers in the corn market bad a dis
tinct advantage during the last half
of the session. Previously sellers
were in a majority owing to an
nouncement by the food administra
tion that the abandonment of sub
stitutes in wheat bread would now
be a benefit. Such a course implied
some curtailment of demand for corn,
and temporarily depressed the market.
Liberal shipping business gave in
dependent strength to oats. It was
said the 'supplies sent forward would
be held on vessels at eastern lake
ports until an outlet was ready.
Provisions averaged higher through
out the day. The reason was scarcity
of offerings coupled with good de

PERFECT WOMANHOOD
Perfect womanhood depends on per
fect health. Beauty and a good dis
position both vanish before pain and
suffering. A great menace to a wom
an's happiness in life is the suffering
that comes from some functional de
rangement which soon develops head
aches, backache, nervousness and "the
blues." For such suffering, women
find help in that famous old root and
herb remedy, Lydia E. Pinkham's Veg

CONTENTED 'TUMMIES'
MAKE GOOD WORKERS
IN DRIVE FOR FUND
EXPERIENCE TAUGHT LOCAL WO
MEN HOW TO KEEP COMMIT
TEES FOR WAR WORK DRIVE
GOING AT TOP NOTCH AND
LUNCHEONS ARE FEATURE
Welfare lectures and writers talk
and write of the psychology of the con
tented workers and employes.
Bisbee women know of the psychol
ogy of the contented workers. None
of them have read or heard the lec
tures of the welfare experts. Few
of them have dug into psychological
questions. But, experience has long
since taught them the truth of the old
maxim of the nearest road to the
heart of the ordinary human being.
Bisbee women have it on welfare
writers and lecturers.-
Once upon a time there was a com
mittee named to solicit funds for the
Stonehatchet club. The workers
started canvasing at 8 o'clock in the
morning and worked until dark. Dur
ing the entire afternoon they felt
something lacking. Now and then one
or the other Would run his hand over
his vest. From noon 'till dark each
of :hem thought more of his vacant
"tummy" than of the subscriptions.
The result was apparent in the re
turns. A welfare expert in the town of
Stonehatchet marked the incident and
inscribed it on leaves of stone, pro
ducing the first document of the
psychology of the worker. Since, simi
lar experts have been producing simi
lar documents without end.
Bisbee committees have been, called
on frequently to solicit funds for war
work. The latest call came for the
united war work campaign, and when
the executive committee met to lay
the plan of work, one of the first
things to be discussed was the daily
luncheon period and report hour. None
read from welfare books and technical
psychological volumes. The women
were agreed to a voice, and arrange
ments were made at once for a "feed"
for every worker at the noon hour.
Yesterday noon, the day before yes
terday noon, this noon, and each noon
until the end of the drive, workers
will have their fill of good substantial
luncheon. Then at the end of the cam
paign all the workers and all others
who have " been connected with the
campaign will meet for the final ban
quet. Just plain reason and experience
told the women that if the workers
have contented "tummies" their work
will be more efficient. If the workers
can meet, compare notes, hear others
report, see what the other teams are
doing, the women knew, the teams
would bring in bigger totals, would
see more people, and would produce
better results. They knew nothing
of the Town of Stonehatchet and its
chairman of the committee which was
to make contented workers out of. the
teams of the united war work drive.

(By Review Leased Wire)
WASHINGTON, "Nov. 13. Meas
ures to promote close agricultural co
operation between the United States,
England. France, Italy and Belgium,
during peace reconstruction, are un
der consideration by these nations.
To work out effective plans,, an inter
national congress of agricultural
leaders, including belligerent and
neutral nations, may be held with the
peace conference.
The general idea under, discussion
contemplates assigning to each coun
try or geographical district specializ
ing in a particular kind of food pro
duction in which it can do best, and
to eliminate the theory that eaflh na
tion should be self-sufficient for pro
duction of all the food or other agri
cultural materials it needs. This
would be similar to the international
pooling of Industrial facilities and raw
materials supply. Regardless of the
Buccess of this proposed plan, it is
certain that tremendous assistance
will be needed from the United
committee; buf they had the Indian states immediately for agricultural
of imperialism and autocracy have
been so thoroughly organized through
out the world, the kaiser was able to
plunge the world into war. Because
the forces of love and humanity vere
rot organized, the kaiser believed he
could conquer the world.
"The laboring men of America real
ized this and realized that there must
be a perfect organization of the
forces of brotherly love and honor.
The American labor movement hopes
to bring out the best possible fra
ternal co-operative and sympathetic
agreement of the working people of
all American countries in orer that
we shall be able to live in peace and
amity.
"Nor do we believe in alienating
ourselves from the laboring people of
other countries. We believe in the
restoration of the international labor
movement after peace has been com
pletely restore to the people, even in
the, countries we have conquered, so
they will have the opportunity of liv
ing under the peaceful governments
we will have helped to establish."

RAILROAD PAY WILL
REMAIN SAME AFTER
WAR AS AT PRESENT
RAILROAD ADMINISTRATION NOW
PLANS NO REDUCTION EITHER
IN WAGES PAID NOR IN PASSEN
GER AND FREIGHT TARIFFS
CHARGED .
(By KpvIpw teased Wire)
WASHINGTON. Nov. 13. The rail-i
road administration plans no reduction j
in raiiroad employes' wages under
peace conditions, and likewise no ma
terial lowering of freight and pas
senger rates, it was stated authori
tatively today. Both are likely to re
main at their present levels, although
with many readjustments, during the
period of changing the nation from
war to peace.
Even with recent advances, railroad
wages now are not as high as those
paid for similar service in war in
dustries. It was declared, and conse
quently railroad administration offi
cials feel that there is no war bonus
to be taken off the wages of rail em
ployes. Events of the laBt week have
caused a pronounced movement of
men from war industries to the rail
roads, where they are Insured greater
permanency of employment, officials
said. Many of these, particularly, la
borers, will I be given work on the
railroads' delayed program of . Im
provements, which have been held up
mainly because of lack of labojf
Director General McAdoo has de
clared that he woid lower rates as
soon as it was determined revenues
would be sufficient to pay wage. In
creases and the higher toA. ;of .ma
terials, supplies and other V asporta
tion elements. It was explained to
day, however, that the time when this
would bo possible is not yet in sight.

vide for an" army reserve officers'
corps similar to that used In building
up the present army. Similarly, it is
regarded as probable that steps to
ward the organization of an ample en
listed reserve will be taken. The form
of the reserve, however, whether by
voluntary obligation or by other, will
depend upon tbe military policy to be
adopted.

(Bv Review teaser! Wire)
' LONDON, Nov. 13. The admiralty
tonight makes its first official an
nouncement of the sinking of the bat
tleship Audacious which sank after
striking a mine off the North Irish
coast on October 27, 1914.
The sinking of the battleship of
ficially was kept a secret at the urg
ent request of the commander in chief
of the Grand Fleet.
News of the sinking of the Audaci
ous was published in the United States
shortly after the disaster, and former
Ambassador Page in London cabled
the information to the state depan-r
ment at Washington, but the request !
from the British government that it :
be kept secret. The British press
printed an account of the warship's
sinking about two months later but
the government withheld confirma-!
tion. I
.After striking the mine, the battle-!
ship remained afloat 12 hours, during
which period the entire crew of 800
men was rescued by the White Star
liner Olympic, Then a terrific explo
sion took place on the Audacious and
she sank. The ship was later raised
and repaired.

SUFFERED DAMAGE,
A number of the cables of the tele

ON HIS WAY.
Judge A. C. Baker, of Phoenix, on
Monday received a telegram from his
son, Lt. Bobbie Baker, who was sup
posed to be on his way to France. As
a matter of fact, he had been but his
telegiam spited that the vessel had
been recalled by wireless and put back
to New York. One cannot say much
in a telegram, but there was enough in
this cne, to convey Lieutenant Baker's
disappointment.
STILL LIABLE TO ARREST.
The end of the war will bring no joy
to the slackers who escaped to neutral
countries in order to evade the draft.
According to the United States attor
ney's office, there will be no let up
in the prosecution of such cases; on
the other hand, such cases will prob
ably be more vigorously prosecuted
than in the past. There is little
chance for a fugitive registrant or a
citizen, to return to the states unno
ticed, for there is a record of every
slacker.

ING HIM FOR SPIRIT OF PATRI
OTIC AMERICANISM
Locally, the hopes of the demo
cratic leaders have expired for putting
over the election of Senator Fred Col
ter as governor of Arizona. This was
evident yesterday when John Twomey,
recognized as a leader in the fight for
Colter's election and since the voting
a constant booster for the belief that
he had received the majority of the
ballots, sent a telegram ot congrn'mu
tiou to Thomas E. Campbell, governor
elect. The reply, received last night, said:
Phoenix, Arizona,

Commander In Chief Tammany Hall,
Brewery Gulch. Bisbee. Arizona.
Knowing the zealous labor and loyal
support your forces gave Senator Col
ter, your congratulatory telegram,
with its splendid spirit of American
ideals, touched me deeply and was sin
cerely appreciated. Your good wishes
for a successful administration can
be attained if you all labor to that
end as honestly as I intend to do. Ex
tend my compliments to the good
losers.

There is considerable comment be- j
ing made in all parts of the state
about the continued strict enforce-:
aient of the quarantine and the oddi-!
Uonal restrictions that were laid down
by Dr. Brown after the meeting held
i Phoenix. There were a number of
new cases reported yesterday, hut not
as many in proportion as has been in
the past. There are some who have
recently taken the disease who are in
a dangerous condition.
Williams, one or the first towns in
the state to be visited with the dis
ease and placed under quarantine Is
op in arms against the contiuued en
forcement of the quarantine. This
may be seen by the following story
that was printed Tuesday by the
Phoenix Gazette:
The town of Williams, through its
town marshal, Bobby Burns, has
served notice upon the state that It
will regard a continued enforcement
of the anti-influenza quarantine as an
overt net against that village and
forthwith will launch upon a war to
the hilt against the state board oi
health.
Telegrams to that effect were sent
by the town marshal to Acting Gov
ernor Sidney P. Osborn, Attorney
General Wiley K. Jones and to the
Gazette. The town authorities at
Williams made their jnove on the
ground that all danger of further rav
ages cf the influenza epidemic has
passed in .Williams.
A hurried "war council" was held
by acting Governor Osborn, Attorney
General Jones and State Health Offi
cer Ilr. O. H. Brown. As a result of
exchanges of opinion among; these
officials it looks as- though Williams'
invitation to combat will be accepted.
The town, through its marshal, has
expressed Its. intention of opening
hostilities in court. It's "war aims"
are stated in a telegram as "justice
to the town of Williams." On the
other side the war aims are "justice
to the disinterested people of Williams
and justice to the lest of the state."
r Dr. Brown Explains.
Pr. Brown, state health officer, who
has the responsibility of enforcing
the rules and regulations of the state
board pf health, made the following
comment upon the situation that has
developed in Williams:
"The quarantine that the state
board of health put into operation in

Williams Is identical with the qnaran-

throughout the entire state. It merely
puts a ban on all public gatherings,
such as churches, schools, pool hal's.
theaters anj dunces. This quarantine
has been promulgated not by any In-
dividual, but by the state board of
health. At the conference of doctors
and county health officers held at the
capitol Saturday It was the unanimous
opinion that wherever the situation
was considered to be serious this quar-
antine should be operative.

"While it may be true that thve

state board or neann mat ine sii'j;t
t Ion 'there is yet too serious to allow
the Quarantine to be lilted. In the
event that the beard of health believe3
that the situation in a given com-
munity is well in hand and that all
danger is passed, the lifting of the
quarantine even then Is contingent
upon two things:
.-jr?,t That all of the s?ven points
relative to precautionary measures
h:.ve been 'complied with. I refer to
the tven points as laid down and
agreed upon by those attending the
conference at the governor's office
Saturday."
When asked what measures would
be t;ikeii to enforce the quarantine in 1 ing its allotment of sugar for the

Osborn wired the eity marshal of
Williams to that effect.
The points referred to include such
things as thorough scrubbing with .
soap and water of theaters and all
public buildings. A rigorous neigh-
borhood cleanup of streets, alleys,
yards, etc. Placarding of houses
where there are "flu" patients. Edu
