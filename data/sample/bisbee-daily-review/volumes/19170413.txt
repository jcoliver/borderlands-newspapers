The Mexican element would be

u
' I!y.-.Review Leased Wire)
WASHINGTON. April 12. Revision
of the administration spy bill to meet
objections to curtailing ' of speech
without tmpaiiiug its effectiveness is
understood to have been decided up
on by the house judiciary committee
today. Hearings on the measure were
closed today after Miss Jane Adame,
John Reed. Gilbert E. Roe. Harry
weiubereer. John U. Moors. Charles
Hallinan and others had ciiticized
certain features.
The sectionmost generally attack
ed prohibiting persons from makins
speeches or publishing articles caus
ing '"dissaffection," in the army or
navy, is certain to be changed. The
language will be amended, according
to present plans, to apply only to per
sons who would cause mutinies, de
" sertions. or other defecticms among
the land or sea forces. The commit
tee has no desire it is said, to silence j
honest critics, although it wants the
governments fully armed to prevent
enemies of the country from s! iniu'
up trouble among its defenders. Th.s
section has been attacked by paci
fists, labor unions, socialists and ad
vocates of free speech generally.
Changes also are contemplated in ,
the sections which would prohibit ob-!
taining and disseminating informa-,
tion about the land and sea forces. As ,

NEW YORK. April 12. Almost two
thirds of today's stork market trad
ing was confined to the more promi
nent industrials, equipments, muni
tions, sh'ppinss and. coppers with a
sprinkling of miscellaneous special
tics and rails. The latter group was
especially inactive.
Dealings in U. S. Steel were rela
tively larger than usual, that stock
rising Vi to 112 but closing at a
net gain of only on extensive pro
fit taking.
? Shippings were higher by 2 to 3
points. Coppers, sugars, leathers, pa!
ers and fertilizers kept moderate pace
with other equipment and supply
stocky but oils were Irregular.
' The more irregular movements
t-re restricted to speculative issues.
Total sales, 645.000 shares.
Peace rumors were current through
oVtj the session. Quotations for for
eign exchange gave no hint of such
negotiations, dealings being exception
silly narrow and light.
" Another increase in liability re
sources was the sole feature of inter

which showed a slight gain in gold

Foreign or international issues
were again sustaining features of the
bond market. Total sales, par value,

COUNTRY AND RELIGION.
The Rev. Mr. Johnson, of Globe, during an address
at the patriotic meeting in the Gila county seat last
Sunday night, voiced a sentiment with which the aver
age American can hardly agree.
"The only flag which has any right to go ahead of the
American flag in this country is the flag of the cross of
Christ"
We fear that the minister, in his statement has
brought up an age-old argument the fight between cival
and tempera! power in government With religion lead
ing in any land, with any government then that nation's
government and its flag is, in second place. ' The- 'on
stitution of the United States wisely provides that all re
ligions must be treated with tolerance. It prevents the
recognition of a religious flag in this country.
Christianity, undoubtedly, leadB the world. Being, a
Christian, or having been raised in a Christian atmos
phere, it pleases the composite American" to consider this
coiintry the greatest and best' We have little, in' the
United States, but Christian people. This fact however,
does not mean that Uie flag of the cross should lead, in
any event, the stars and stripes.
We can not agree with the Globe minister. We would
egree with him had he declared in favor of Christianity
as a religion. When he stated that the flag of Christ
would be entitled to precedence ever the American
colors we think he is voicing a sentiment which is dis
tinctly un-American and wrong in its entirety.
There are many in the country who do not worship
Christ The cross means nothing to those people. W to
are we that Christianity should beput m" a 'pedestal
above all other religions? Because we have been raised
in that atmosphere, it would lead us to believe in our
parent religion;, but that does not make our religion right
and air others wrong.
In the discussing of flags it would appear to us that
a divorcement of religions and national emblems be
made. Religion and government has caused more trou
ble than nearly every other agency in the history of the
world. Religion's emblems, except as they may apply to
each individual, should be1 eliminated when the flag of
tie nation is considered. We are all entitled to the con
sideration of our Religion, no matter what it is; but the
national emblem must go first
AEROPLANE STAGES.
Some years ago to have printed a story to the effort
that a company was in the process of formation to pur
rhase aeroplanes with which to conduct a stage line over
Arizona mountains, would have been branded the author
as an eccentric idiot or an embryo Jules "erne. At the
present time, though we rather incline to the belief
that it is mostly talk, we can not overlook the possibil
ities and the fact that scientifically such a proposal is
possible and read with interest such an announcement.
When the automobile supplanted the stage service be
tween Phoenix and Roosevelt the people of the Sa't
River Valley declared that another era had arrived.
Shortly after that the roadway from Globe to the Dam
was completed and in course of time the. stage lines were
running between the Oila county beat aud the state cap
ital. Today the traffic, via this route, is large.
There appears, as a consequence of the demand, for
new traffic conditions, a Ilioenix man who says that a
company which he is promoting will soon be sending
aeroplanes over the route, carrying passengers, freight
and the' mails.
We can only say that we hope the service will be
started. It will be an entirely new thing iu stage Hues.
It will place Arizona in the front rank of progress in fro
direction of better traffic conditions for out-of-the-way
places. It may be the ln-giuuiug of aerial routes which
will overcome even the high curreuts aud high tpola in
travel of today,
a
Its possibilities are enormous and we hope to see tl:e
project st least tried out The idea speaks wonders fcf
Arizona's push and daring.
JUST A QUESTION
Since the election of last fall there have- been many .
people in Arizona who have wanted ,to know what con
stituted a Democrat The Hunt folks have been very
pessimistic regarding the Democracy of many men over
the state. They question a man's democracy because
he did not vote for Hunt I nmany instances, however,
they did not vote for others on the same ticket with
Hunt The Arizona Republican, under the heading cf
jfWhat is a Democrat?" makes some interesting observa
tions: Here they are:
"Whether a member of a political party is to be de
barred: from activity la behalf of his party because he
happens not to approve a single party candidate is an
archaic question: raised by the attorneys for former Gov
ernor Hunt ia the gubernatorial contest the other day
Forty or fifty years ago ia the old "yellow dog" days
such a question might have been debatable, but hardly
so now, when party lines are wavering and breaking as
they have been doing for twenty years.
"This subject was brought up in a question asked by
Mr. Ives of Mr. Shumway a democratic election worker
in Snowflake precinct whether because he was not in
sympathy with the candidacy of Governor Hunt he was
not guilty of an, impropriety in accepting a democratic
election function. ' ' 5 . ' : , ' .'

inct as much ,more; vital, than' the success of ' one or
two candidates on ..the democratic . ticket Thus , Mr.
Shumway. had either of two good reasons for not sup
porting Governor Hunt . ' ,
Moreover; he found1 himself as ' the count showed.
In a large company of democrats.' It .appears from the
vote cast for other democratic candidates that half the
democrats of Snowflake prpciact entertained the same
view as his own with respect' .to Governor Hunt We
i . . ..
believe that halt the democrats of Maricopa, and Gra
ham, counties voted against the former governor with
as great enthusiasm as the republicans. In all', the coun
ties , large , numbers oC -democrats voted- for Governor
Campbell and" many ot. them, leaders of the party for
veaas, worked, actively for him.: In fact, in no county,
did. Governor Hunt poll nearly the normah democrat!:
vote. Tie made any sort of a showing at all only in those
precincts where there jrtis a, heavy Western Federation
of Miners vote and the Wesfern Federation of Miners is
not a democratic party organization.
"Other thousands ot democrats did not go to the1 pells
at all and some republicans abscented themselves. We
have met many of both, who said they were Campbell
men but they believed that Hunt . would certainly be
elected. They did not want to participate in what they
fetl sure would be defeat. But for tills sentiment, the
majority of Governor Campbell would have) been of
such volume as to- have precluded a contest
"It is better to be a good citizen than to be either a
?ood democrat or a good republican. No good, citizen,
is bound by the choice of a majority of a comparatively'
few members of his party at a primary (and primaries
are never well attended), to support the candidates
nominated there, if that were so we would always have
the rule of the minority at general elections. It is by the
independent action of thinking men that parties are
kept in good condition. The party must be purified and
strengthened from within. The defeat of improper can-
. . a-
didates by the votes of members of their own parties will
make parties more discriminating in their choice of can
didates. The party conventions learned that, and upw
that the primaries have taken the places of the con
ventions the people must learn the lessou."

"Broadway Jones" Last
Night; Comedy Characters
Good.
"Broadway Jones." the rollicking
Co'iau and Harris success, presented
'ant niht at the Orpheum theatre by
Albert Taylor and company, proved
)ii" of !he best comedies ever prod tic
(1 heri; by a stock company. Taylor,
in the leading role, kept the audience
in a perfect Kale of laughter with his
."Iv.raoLorization of "Broadway Jones"
whose principle troubles are "money,
women and debts. Jack Benson, as
'Hob Wallace," was good, his laugh
ilvays provoking a responding laugh
from the audience. Benson Is one of
the few actors who can get real en
ioyment.out of a stage laugh and put
it over without it sounding forced.
Jack Mahon in the leading comedy
character part, Sam Spotwood, put up
some of the best comedy acting seen
here in many moons, anmade a great
Jeal of a really minor part. s
Miss : Myrtle Hollingsworth was a
charming Jose Richards, and "Broad
way Jones" could not be blamed for
proposing to her after an acquaint
ance of but a few days. James Wil
yliams, Phil and ("arlie- Hoelan, Rich
ard Lancaster. Lloyd Carrell, Miss
Norma Morris and Miss Mary Barry,
supporting Mr. Taylor and Miss Hol
lingsworth all did excellent. Any
company that can produce a comedy
like. "Broadway Jones" was put on
last night by the Taylor players,
should be good enough for the most
critical theatre fan.
"Alias Jimmie Valentine." a play
that needs no introduction to the pub
lic, will be the offering for tonight.
IS IT NOT TRUE that usually the ones who are in the habit of having
unusual opportunities presented to them almost daily consider them
very lightly at the time, only to look back in after years with regret?
Is it not often the case that the mine has made the men as the men:
making the mine? It is not a habit most of us have of refering to a
man who has become prosperous, as being "lucky ?" Is it not truJ
that his judgment and vision was'just a little better and clearer?

JAPANESE ACTOR IS
FEATUREOAT LOWELL
Sessue Hayakawa And Myrtle
Steadman Play Today in
"The Soul of Kura-San"
The beautiful, painted Japanese
paneling which is seen in the tea
bouse interior in the Jesse L. Lasky
production of "The Soul of Kura-San"
which will be the Paramount attrac
tion at the Central theatre today with
Sessue Hayakawa in the stellar role,
supported by Myrtle Stedman, was
made by the latest Lasky discovery.
Carlie Z. Ho, a Japanese artist. When
the Lasky Company first organized, a
young Japanese boy was engaged to :
look after and keep clean the dressing i
rooms of the members of that organ!-!
zation. As the t'oropany grew, tais
Lemons Whiten and
Beautify the Skin!
Make Cheap Lotion
i
iue juice Vh two tresh lemons
strained into a bottle containing three
ounces of orchard white makes a
whole quarter pint of the most remark
able lemon skin beautiuer at about the
cost one must pay for a small jar of
the- ordinary cold creams. Care
should be taken to strain the lem'jn
juice through' a fine cloth so no lemon
pulp gets in, then this lotion will keep
fresh for months. Every woman knows
that lemon juice is used tb bleach and
remove such blemishes as freckles,
sallowhess and tan and is the ideal
skin softener, snx'othener and beauti
fier. -
Just try it! Make up a quarter pint
of this sweetly fragrant lemon lotion
and massage it: daily into the face,
neck, arms and hands. It should nat
urally help to whiten, soften, freshen,
and . bring out the hidden roses and
beauty of any skin. It is wonderful
for rough, red bands.
Your druggist Will sell three ounces
of 'orchard white at little cost, and
any 'groctr will supply the lemons.

young man was put in charge of the
corps of men required to look alter
me tidiness of the studio. This boy
was Carlie Z. Ho unknown and un
i.ung merely the foreman of the
cleaners.
About four months ago, the Lasky
Company wanted fc-Jine examples of
Japanese painting for a production
and could not locate a fully capable
Japanese artist. Ito heard of this mat
ter and promptly submitted some de
signs which were immediately ac
cepted, and it was then discovered that
he was a graduate of the Imperial Art
School in Tokio, and had a number
of his paintings and drawings on exhi
bition in toe focal art stores. Carlie
was removed from his capacity as a
cleaner and given a studio of his own
so quickly that it made his head swim,
and now he has charge of all the Jap
anese paintings required by the bifc
Lasky Company.
In the cast supporting Sessue Haya
kawa and Myrtle Stedman in this pro
duction are a number of prominent
stars, including Tsura Aoki, George
Webb, Thomas Kurihara, Geo. Kuwa
and H. Konishi.

William Conklin. who has an im

personality is the one best asset a

"Lacking the aid of dialogue he
talks to them through the medium of

ought to know. Coming to the screen
after a notable stage career, he has
made a big success.
"I believe that the time is near."

care as stage plays. I mean by that
that time will be taken not only in

FRECKLE-FACE
Sun and Wind Bring Out Ugly Spots.
How Remove Them.
Here's a chance. Miss Freckle-face,
to try a remedy for freckles with the
guarantee of a reliable dealer that it
will not cost you a penny unless it
removes the freckles; while If it does
give you a clear complexion the ex
pense is trifling.
Simply get an ounce of othine
double strength from any druggist
and a few applications should show
you how easy it is to rid yourself of
the homely freckles and get a beauti
ful complexion. Rarely is more than
one ounce needed for the worst case.
Be sure to ask the druggist for thr
double strength othine as this is the
prescription sold under guarantee tl
money back if it fails to remove the
freckles.

The reason for the excitement is the
illness of A. D. Robertson, of the Pure

clude all customers. Whenever the
wagon started to go by a customer's

Residents of County Seat Are
Quick to Put Stop to Any
Disloyal Conversation;
Trusty Is Sent Back To Jail.
Tombstone is a regular little hotbed
of patriotism. Hardly a day passes
but what patriotic citizen "slams"
some less patriotic person for ventur
ing to make derogatory remarks about
either the army, navy or government.
Not that there are any more "pacif
ists" in Tombstone than in any oilier
city, but there se-m V.i be more citi
zens in the county seat who are de
termined that all dissension must be
stopped at this critical time.
A native of England yesterday be
came involved in an argument with a
German regarding the entrance of the i
United States in the war. The Cer-I
! man became uncomplimentary in re-'
Jferring to Uncle Sam, and was prompt- J
ly lanueu severa gooa waiiops. v nen
the dust cleared away, the kaiser's
supporter looked as if he had been
hit with a double-Jack instead of only
twj fists. He did not argue further.
Pat McXeillis, sent up from Court
land for bootlegging, who has been
acting as a trusty at the county jail,
was yesterday sent back to the road
gang as an ordinary prisoner for un-:
patriotic remarks. McNeills, it is
said, was overheard telling another
prisoner that he wished there would (
be more explosions like the one in 1
Eddystone, Pennsylvania, several I
days ago. when more than a hundred I
people were killed. McNeills w-as tak
en before Judge Lockwood, who. after
lecturing him severely, ordered him ,
remanded to the county jail without j
being given credit for any extra time, i
An employ of the Mountain States
Telephone and Telegraph Company.'
Vorking on the new Benson line, was j
discharged recently after the. company i
had Investigated his attitude. The!
man, a native of Austria, insisted on !
trying to stir up sentiment against the
United States. Loyal employes re
ported this to the company, and the
