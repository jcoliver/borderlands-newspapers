HOOVER SAYS
HE CAN CUT
Give Government Food Con'

Fy $20 Per Barrel For
Wheat, Says Belgium's
Savior.
CONTROL WILL LOWER
PRESENT WHEAT PRICE
There Is No Occasion For
Food Panic In U. S., Nor
Any Justifica tion In Present
Outrageous Prices, He Says.
(By Review Leased Wire).
NEW YORK, May 10. Herbert C.
Hoover, who recently came from Eur
open to advise the gvoernment on food
conditions in Europe says tlfat with
out control we may see flour 'at $20 a
barrel before the year is oVer, but
that with control "the present price
of flour can be reduced 40 to 50 per
cent, end at the same time the pro
ducer be treated in a liberal manner."
Mr. Hoover thus outlined food con
ditions in a statement to the Associat
ed Press today:
Prices Outrageous.
"There is absolutely no occasion for
food panic in this country nor any
justification for outrageous prices un
less the opposition of special Interests
defeats the President In obtaining the
necessary powers' to control the na
tion's food fully and adequately, Am
erica's is not one of famine, for we
have now and will have next year a
large surplus. Our problem, is, after
the proper protection of our own peo
. pie' to give to our allies hte last
ounce of surplus of which we are cap
able. Help Allies Easily.
"Therefore the nation needs a food
control for two purposes: To regulate
prices and to increase the surplus.
After providing for our normal con
sumption we will have together with
Canada a surplus for our allies equal
to only sixty per cent of the food they
require from us. If we take broad
measures of control we can, with as
little disturbance to domestic machin
ery as need be, furnish them an addl
toinal 20 per cent
Limit Exports To Neutrals.
"Their loaf even then will be a pri
vation loaf, and every ounce we can
put in it will diminish their privation.
The problem is capable of solution.
If, however, the whole world, allied
and neutral, is to have the unrestrict
ed run of our markets in competition
with each other and competition with
the speculation in this country, we
may expect to see $5 wheat before the
year Is over.
"Large measures of fodo control do
not mean arbitrary interference with
the necessary economic machinery of
trade. They mean that every branch
be called in by the government and
forge themselves into a link from
which the contemplated chain will pro
tect producer, legitimate distributor,
and consumer.
"For instance, I am assured that the
Amerrican farmer did not realize $1.40
per bushel for the 1916 wheat harvest,
yet the price of wheat in New York
today is $3.25 per bushel and flour is
$14 per barrel, with all its attendant
hardship and distraction of social and
industrial life.
"I have no hesitation in saying that
If the able, patriotic man representing
the majority of each branch of the
food trades were called in clothed
with the necessary power to force out
the small minority of skunks that
exist In every trade, one result would
be an equally nutritious flour based ou
$1.50 wheat which could be sold in
New York for a good deal under $S
per barrel and every trade would re
ceive its legitimate profits. Without
control we may see $20 flour before
the year is out, and a total distortion
of wages and consequent distortion of
Industry and living.
"On the other hand, if we overcome
the submarine and if we open our
markets to our allies we may see
wheat a $1 a bushel and flour under
$6. In any event with sufficient con
trol, the present price of flour can be
reduced by 40 to 60 per cent and at
the same time the producer treated
in a liberal manner."

Mr. Rogers made the following!
statement:
"It is difficult to understand the
policy of the government not in the
unfair if not illegal practice of dat

so great a tax on business in any
form; and particularly in placing so

NEW YORK, Way 10. Three
dramatic events which will be
come historic in the annals of
New York marked the activities
of the French war mission here
today. In their chronological or
der they were:
The address of Rene Viviani,
vice premier of the mission, at a
luncheon of the Merchant's As
sociation when he declared France
never wculd cease fighting until
Alsace and Lorraine were restor
ed to her, and when he proclaimed
that the Stars and Stripes would
never attain their full significance
until they floated from the trench
es of Europe.
Joffre Honors Grant,
The placing by Marshal Joffre of u
wreath upon the sarcopbague of Gen

French Sailors Present.
The reception to the French resi
dents of the city at the public library
tonight when Joffre, Viviani and other
colleagues greeted their compatriots,
including several hundred bluejackets
from French warships. The specta
cle which appealed most to the popu
lar imagination was that enacted at
Grant's tomb.
Then followed a review of the Sev
enth Regiment, New York national
guard in front of the tomb, after which
the visitors were taken through River
side Drive to Die Joan of Arc statue,
where a brief stop was made. All
along the route, extending several
miles, were great throngs of cheering
men, women and children.
At the Joan of Arc statue, a declara
tion from the Daughters of the Amer
ican Revolution presented Marshal
Joffre with a check for 28,000 francs
to be used at hi3 discretion for chari
table purposes.
A wreath of white laurel was hand
ed to Marshal Joffre and he placed it
reverently at the base of the statue
while the crowd stood silent.

It emphasizes the purpose to effect a
peace settlement which will impose
upon Germany the chief burden of

(By Review Leased Wire)
WASHINGTON, May 10. The
long deadlock of snate and
house conferees on the selective
draft mil'tary bill was broken
today with agreement on a com
promise measure under which a,
great war army would be raised
by selective conscription of men
between the ages of 21 and 31.
Authorization for recruiting
Colonel Roosevelt's proposed vol
unteer division, written into the
bill by the senate and defended
stubbornly by the senate con
ferees finally was thrown out on
the insistence of committee men
representing the house.
"DRY" ARMY POSTS
In return the house yielded to
the senate's Proposal for prohi
bition at military posts.
The conference report is ex
pected to be g'ven approval by.,
both senate and house in a few
days and within two weeks af
ter the President has affixed his
signature, registration of those
eligible for conscription will be
under way throughout the coun
try. In Camp by September
The war department has erected
a vast war machine for assigning and
organizing the conscripts. They will
be assembled at training camps in
September. The compromise bill is
understood to be generally satisfac
tory to the administration and to the
army general staff on whose advice
the the original measure was framed.
The most important change in con
gress was in the age limits, fixed by
the staff at 19 and 25 inclusive. The
senate made them 21 and 27 and the
house 21 and 40.

The ages named in the conference
agreement are 21 and 30 inclusive
making the draft applicable to all
male voters under thirty-one.

opposition to it has been inferred

three regiments of volunteers could
have been enlisted for service on the
Mexican border. '
The section dealing with exemp
tions from draft was rewritten in part
by the conference committee and pro
vision was made for hearings in ex

She will be seen again this
afternoon and evening at the Orpheum
in "War Brides." Many offers have
been made to Nazimova, but she had
rejected them all, and the secret of
her final capitulation to the newest

Ibsen's plays were formerly regarded
as a drug on the market, and yet in
one after another of those history
making classics, she scored tremend
ously. In "A Doll's House," "Hedda
Gabler" and "Little Eyolf," she won
the highest laurels. She turned to
comedy and in "The Countless Co
quette" she was equally successful.
She is the cn'y player who has been
able to introduce successfully to the
American stage a full length drama
by the great Arthur Schnitzler, and in
"The Fairy Tale" she scored again.
Departing from this European re
pertoire, she starred in "Bella Donna"
playing to crowded houses in all the
cities in teh United States. Turning
to vaudeville, she reached the zenith
of her popularity in the only war play,
based upon the present struggle, which
is conceded to be of permanent value.
In "War Brides" she is no longer the
patrician but a humble village girl who
revolts against militarism, and with
the same subtlety as in her "Hedda"
and "Bella Donna" brings new mean
ing to the portrait of the oppressed
women of a great empire.
Y. M, G. A, PREPARES TO
FOLLOW THE SOLDIERS
The mobilization of the grand
crmed forces of the United Stales
has called for a like mobilization of
Y. M. C. A. forces to minister to the
great bodies of men who will soon
be drawn together. Beginning with
the work of the Christian Commission
in the Civil War, the Young Men's
Christian Association has r.ever failed
to respond to the country's call. Its
tents were familiar in the camps of
IS98 and since the troops were plac
ed on the Mexican border one hun
dred and fifty secretaries on the av
erage have been giving their per
sonal service and the use of the Y.
M. C. A. equipment to the men on
guard.
A conference of association leaders
was held at Garden City, Long Is
land, April 10. to outline a work for
the soldiers and sailors of the en
larging army and navy. This con
ference, acting with the approval of
the war and navy departments at
Washington, adopted a policy which
will provide association buildings and
secretaries for a force of 1,000,000

The emergency organization would

The senate agricultural sub-committee
today agreed on provisions
of a food control bill to be introduced
tomorrow by Senator Gore, ft is sim

the administration food bills offered
in the house by Mr. Lever, and would
made immediately available an ap
propriation for a food survey. It also

stimulate production by giving the
secretary of agriculture power to see
'hat seeds are distributed more even
ly and more promptly. Hoarding for
the purpose of manipulating the mar
ket would he made unlawful as would
combinations that control food re
sources. Secretary Houston in a statement
today declared early passage of the
bills essential to successful conduct
of the war.
"There is no more urgent matter
before us than the food question,"
he said. "We need food for ourselves
and for our allies. The planting sea
son is passing and it would be a great
aid if we could put our agents out
now.
"Unless the first measure is passed
now, some parts of the country must

food shipments preference over other
commodities probably will be asked

PRESS TO PROTEST
WAR TAX PROPOSAL
(Continued From Page One)
the gathering of war news and the
increased circulation for increased
circulation means increased expense.
"In the last year most of the news
paper in the country have been com
pelled to increase the subscription
price of their papers as well as their
advertising, rates in an attempt to
obtain sufficient earnings to carry on
their business. Newspapers in nor
mal times seldom increase the ad
vertising rates fast enough to keep
up with the increased cost of in
creased circulation and the last year
has seen the most papers facing a
severe financial crisis. In spite of
these facts the new revenue .bill pro
poses and increase in ipostal rates
which are particularly jlnfair. a tax
of 10 per cent on print paper impor
tations, and. I understand, a tax on
advertising receipts any one of
which would wipe out all the profits
of most newspapers even in normal
times, and at such times as these
will tend to discourage publication of
many newspapers and force out of
employment many men specially
trained to this work and whose value
in other lines is comparatively small.
The newspapers fully realize the
seriousness of the present situation
and apprciate that they must bear
their share of the burdens but the
provisions of this proposed bill seems
more severe on newspapers than on
any other line of business and are
to this extent unjust and indefensi

WHEELER TO LEAVE
FOR PRESIDIO TODAY
(By Review Leased Wire).
TOMBSTONE, May " 10. Special
Sheriff Harry C. Wheeler, will leave
in the morning for San Francisco, to
answer his countrys call and report at
the Officers' Reserve Training Quart
ers. When the news came that the
United States was about to'nter the
world war. Wheeler was one of the
first to 'offer his services to the United
States in any capacity. His previous
military .record and ability as an of
ficer was quickly recognized by the
officials and he was one of the first
notified to report at the training camp.
He has secured a leave of absence for
sixty days from the board of super
visors in order to attend the camp,
and has nbt resigned as sheriff of Co
chise county, as has been reported. It
is his intention, however, to resign if
he is finally accepted for service in
the army of the United States, and
there is but little doubt entertained by
those who know him and his record
but that he will be accepted. Should
he fail physically he will return and
make use of the knowledge he has
gained in the training of the county
posse should it bet'jiiie necessary.
After he had offered his services to
the government Wheeler received over
a hundrd applications of citizens oi
Cochise county and elsewhere offering
to go and serve under him in the ev
ent that he was chosen to lead a com
pany or regiment. Saeriif Wheelei
requetsed the newspapers to extend
his heart felt thanks t'j all for iheir
offers and to suggest to them, that if
they still wanted tooffer their services
to the government they miguc enlist
in the Arizona National Guard.
He regrets that he cannot take all
of these patriots with him and have
them serve with him, but says that
while they might be enlisted in dif
ferent regiments they would all be
fighting for the same cause and might
meet on the battle fields of France,
in the trenches in some other country,
'jr whereever ordered. He further
stated that all should offer their
services and abide by the government's
decision as to the future.
Sheriff Wheeler will carry with
him the best wishes of thousands of
citizens of Cochise county as well a
of anyone and adjoining states, in his
desire to become one of the leaders
in the battle for den.'jcracy. He had
letters of recommendation that accom
panied his application from Governor
Campbell, G. W. P. Hunt, United
States Senators and Representatives.
as well as all the county officials, and
many other prominent citizens of the
county and state.

Are The Successful
Business Men of Today
Buying Oil Stocks
BECAUSE The consumption is 200.000 barrels per day more than the
production and unless more oil is produced in the future, auto
owners and other consumers will be told how many gallons per,
per day. they can consume.
BECAUSE The price of oil is advancing and the demand for oil is
growing daily, the cry is more liquid gold more oil.
BECAUSE Oil has hit the highest mark in history and it is the most
promising business for big quick clean profits.
When careful conservative business men, men who have made a suc
cess of their business, men who. after thorough investigation, invest
their money in this company then surely it is time for you to in
yestigate the ARIZONA-OKLAHOMA OIL & GAS COMPANY and if
you investigate you will buy.

NEW YORK. May 10. Much atten
tion was paid to the rumblings of
peace rumors today and as liquida
tion in most all classes of securities
has been rather severe of late and
the dark side of the situation elab
orated upon, the prospects of more
tranquil conditions oer the universe
while lacking in authority created a
better feeling which was reflected in
betterment in values. Shorts seemed
to be cn the anxious seat owing to
the fact of more important liquida
tion to develop and In their effort
to return commitments helped con
siderable to deviate prices. There
was also some buying by professional
operators both on the reaction the
ory. More selling of Investment Issues
Is likely to assert itself on any up
turn of consequence although this
may be deterred somewhat in the
event of aid from the I. C. C. in its
decision on the carriers petition for
higher freight rates.

LINCOLN ON CONSCRIPTION.
It has been shown that George Washington, the Father
of his Country, was a conscriptionisL It has been shown
that Thomas Jefferson, the author of the r '.ration of
Independence and,.more than any other man, . Founder
and the perpetual inspiration of American uemocracy,
6aw no national safety and no justice among citizens ex
cept in universal military service.
Abraham Lincoln, the savior of the Union and the
greatest leader of a free people that has arisen in mod
ern times, completes our trinity of American statesmen
whose word was gospel. And Lincoln gave a clearer ex
pression to his beilef in conscription. In a time of nations;
need, than either of his great predecessors. He wrote
in his "Address to the American People," in the most
critical period of the civil war:
"The principle of draft, which simply is involuntary or
enforced service, is not new. It has been practiced in all
ages of the world. It was well known to the framers of
our constitution as one of the modes of raising armies,
at the time they placed in that instrument the provision
that, the congress shall have power to raise and support
armies.' It had been used just before in establishing in
dependence, and was also used under the constitution
in 1812.
"Wherein is. the peculiar hardship now? Shall w
shrink from the necessary means to maintain our free
government which our grandfathers employed to estab
lish it and our own fathers have already employed to
maintain it?
"Are we degenerate? Has the manhood of the race
run out?"
Every word of that appeal is applicable toda'y. And if
Lincoln were" among us now, who can doubt that he
would have made it still stronger and emphasized the
fact that there is no democratic equality in war itme
except through the equal responsibility of all citizens for
war service?
And what would Lincoln have thought if he had been
compelled to listen to the recent debate in congress, and
heard a speaker of the house of representatives prating
of "the disgrace of a draft" and likening a "conscript"
to a "convict?"
SCHOOLS IN MEXICO.
Every now and then a bit of encouraging news comes
ouFof Mexico that has nothing to do with revolutions and
bandits and plots. It tells, instead, of a step forward in
the conditions of the common people ofMexico.
One such report recently announced Jthe increase in
the number of schools. A permanent National Education
Congress is planned, holding regular sessions and at
tended by educators who will work for the educational
advance of the Mexican people.
There is no system of compulsory education throughout
Mexico, but there are localities where both parents and
children have been required to attend school, the chil
dren during the daytime and the parents at night, learn
ing to read and write. Compulsory education for the
whole country is coming, educators say, as fast as con
ditions make it possible to enforce it.
An agricultural school has been established in Sonora;
a national forestry school is located in a suburb of Mex
ico City; industrial training is being given in many
orphan asylums. In many places primary schools have
opened with large attendance.
It is a gratifying showing and one that will surprise
many of us who are too willing to class all Mexicans
under the general head of ignorant and dirty and in
capable of advancement.
RELIEVING THE PAPER FAMINE.
Lord NorthclifTe. publisher of the London Times and
several other English newspapers, has performed a not
able service to the American press. It is announced that
he will place at the disposal of the newspapers of this
country the entire output of his Newfoundland paper
mills, thereby relieving the critical print-paper situation
in the United Slates.
The- production thus added to our present supply
amounts to 6S.0O0 tons a year. This, while small in com
parison with ilie total consumption, is expected to bo
enough to break the present monopoly and assure us an
adequate supply at less exorbitant prices.
The most admirable (eature vf the plan Is that the
Newfoundland paper is to go to the small publishers, the j
class especially hard hit by the scarcity and high prices ;
of the last two years. The big publishers, in general,
can take care of themselves. Some of them have estab-'
lished their own paper mills. All of them are able, either
thorugh influence or through ability to place large orders,
to obtain a dependable -supply at tolerable cost. The
smaller papers have been obliged to pay often twice as j
much, and frequently have been unable to get enough ;
paper at any price. j
Large numbers of publishers have thus been ruined, j
Many papers have stopped publication; many have had
to raise their rates to meet the cost of white paper. All
have had to practice unwelcome economics. Relief of j
tfie sort proposed is therefore particularly welcome. j
The federal trade commission deserves praise for hav- j
ing made this arrangement with the great British pub-,
lisher. The paper is to be distributed by the Publishers' j
Association under supervision of the commission. In j
view of the public Importance of having the American 1
press able to carry on its work adequately, especially in
war time, this is one of the most useful services the
trade commission has rendered the country.

GAS RANGES
VOLUNTEER MONEY AND MEN.
Large numbers of citizens subject to the income tax
are hastening to grant the informal request of the fed
eral treasury department and pay their tax several weeks
before it's due. In the case of many of them the interest i
they thus forfeit would amount to a respectable little i
sum, and the men concerned are ordinarily pretty care-j
ful about interest that's why they happen to have tax-i
able incomes. They forego the traditional right of a
tax-payer to hang onto his money till the last possible
moment, because Uncle Sam needs it more now than he
will later. It comes in handy to pay the first war bills.
This is a pleasing demonstration of patriotism. It's a
pnmnan HvpIv small matter, and vet imnortant because
it shows the attitude of the "capitalist class." Some of
our agitators who assume to speak for humbler classes
still keep up the old cry that the rich start wars, let the
poor fight them, contribute nothing and reap the profits.
But the cry is growing faint now, because it is no longer
true. 1
Our business and professional classes have responded
as readily as citizens of any other class. They have no
only given money with great liberality, but they have
volunteered their personal services for any necessary
war duty, military or otherwise.

HANGING SALAD GARDENS.
Even the people who live in tenement houses and flats
and there are such in all the large cities of the United
States can have their little war gardens. It doesn't re
quire any land at all, nor any digging and weeding.
An old blanket hung on a line and kept thoroughly
moist will do the deed. At least, that it what Prof. Jas
per Jeggles, an English botanist, says. The crop isn't
fattening or muscle-making. But it's a good salad. Mus
tard and cress are the greens that may be raised on these
blanket gardens.
As Prof. Jeggles describes such a garden: "All that is
required is an old blanket hung over a line and well
soaked with fresh water. Sprinkle the mustard seeds on
one half, and the cress on the other. ,Keep the blanket
damp, and in two weeks the crop will be ready to cut
for the table."
Any soft, absorbent material may be used instead of
blanket. In England they are making umorenas oi a
suitable material for raising salad. The Professor had
a salad garden on some old pajamas in his cabin when
crossing the Atlantic. Damp walls would serve equally
welL
Here's your chance. If you're not afraid of rheumatism.
you can hank a garden in your home and have mustard
and cress salad all the year 'round.
WHAT'S A GOLDFISH?
The county tax department at Canton, O., has been
puzzling over the legal and economic status of goldfishes.
A Canton woman, listing her property, entered "one
goldfish" under the heading of "live stock." That de
scription was promptly questioned in the auditor's office.
It was agreed that the term live stock was properly
applied only to "horses, cows, pigg and such animals."
But what was a goldfish Nobody seemed to be sure
about it One tax deputy maintained trai a goransn is a
decoration, and should be classed as household goods."
Another insisted that "goldfish is jewelry."
A scurrillous editor in a neighboring city suggests that
."maybe they're all of them wrong, and a goldfish is a
bird." But that's trifling with a serious subject. Why
not take it to the courts?
TEACHING ARMY COOKS TO COOK.
Expert instruction in the preparation of army rations
is to be given this spring at Columbia University. The
course is open to qualified chefs. There is a second
course in emergency cooking open to men.
These courses are planned to train army cooks and
assistants, boy scout cooks, etc. It's a branch of army
training that has been neglected in the past. Army cooks
arc noted for one characteristic inability to cook. Yei
there's no reason why they should go at their task un
prepared any more than the actual fighter. In fact, much
of the fighter's efficiency depends on the food he eats.
It's a patriotic move for the university to offer snh
courses. Other schools with well-equipped cooking and
j.mrimpnis imelit to follow the example. And
the enrollment in such classes will probably be large.
There's something in names, after all. The first Aiikt
lean ennner to sink a German submarine was a lieutenant
named D. Ware.

harder to please in
clothes than older
men ; they want
something more in

more, even, than
style; they, want a

1 ness in their
clothes; they can't
describe it , but
they know it when
they get it.
