Plan Wholesale Prosecutions
WASHINGTON. Aug. 5. Close co
operation between state authorities
and the attorney general and his staff
of assistants empowered to enforce
the food control, law, is being estab
lished as part of the government's
fight to reduce the cost of living. In
structions went out today from Attor
ney General Palmer to the two dis
trict attorneys in Ohio to proceed im
mediately to assist Governor Cox in
the seizure of large quantities of meat,
butter and eggs, alleged to have been
held in storage in that state for more
than six to ten months, the legal
limit.
Criminal prosecutions will be insti
tuted, it was held if it can be shown
that the foods were held . from the
market for the purpose of boosting
prices. Officials here were inclined
to think that the long period of stor
age indicated some other reason than
an effort to spread the abundant sup
plies of a producing season over the
lean part of the year.
Acting on a telegram late today
from Governor Cox saying that a
Cleveland concern in order to escape
possible! prosecution for hoarding was
moving its meat products to ware
houses in Chicago and destroying its
records, the department of justice or
dered the district, atorney at Cleve
land to look into the matter imme
diately. All attempts to effect transfer -of
goods in storage, officials said, would
be summarily dealt with.
Seizure of large stocks of food
stuffs in storage continued today. Re
ports were received "of libels filed In
Cleveland and Detroit, and prepara
tions for such action in many cities.
The department waa informed tonight
that the district attorney at. Detroit
had filed libels in three cases and
seized approximately 10,460,000 eggs,
and 300,000 pounds of butter, all of
which had been held in storage for
some time.
Statistics announced by the bureau
of markets, showing a great increase
in the amount of food held in storage,
were said by Judge Ames, assistant to
the attorney general in charge in en
forcing the food control law, to bear
out the department's contention that
a prime reason for prices was the
holding of supplies from the market.
'We are going to force these hoard
ers and profiteers to disgorge,"
Judge Ames declared, "wherever they

On Railroads Asked
In denying that more or less people

Beach asserted that half the people

reasonable compensation on invested
capital.

INTERVENTION
IN MEXICO IS
NOT PROBABLE
No Further Action By U. S.
Following Ban Placed Upon
All Arms Shipments Into
Mexico, State Dept. Asserts
WASHINGTON, D. C, Aug. 15. No
answer to the reply of the Mexican
government to the state department's
warning that failure to protect Ameri
cans might result in a radical phange
of policy, will be. made. Officials ex
plained today that the United States
will wait until President Carranza has
displayed either unwillingness or in
ability, to afford Americans the pro
tection they had a right to expect, be
fore taking further action.
One of the first possibilities of ac
tion, should the government be forced
to it, would be to withdraw diplomatic
representatives or even to withdraw
recognition of the Carranza govern
ment. Active intervention is considered in
most quarters a remote measure at
this stage. . .
The Carranza government by spe
cial provision has been receiving
arms and ammunition from the United
States, but it was indicated today that
the decree forbidding exportation of
war munitions to Mexico would be
applied to the government as well as
to .individuals until further proof had
been given that foreigners would re
ceive adequate protection.
MAY SOLVE OIL QUESTION
MEXICO CITY, Aug. 15. It was an
nounced authoritatively today that the
supreme court on Friday decided to
meet to consider the five "Amparps"
brought . by foreign oil interests
against the national executives petrol
eum decrees of July and August, 1918.
These "amparos," which were rejected
by the lower courts, are said to have
been made matters of grave and ur
gent importance and placed at the
head of the supreme court .calendar
for immediate consideration.'
Should the supreme court reverse
tbe decision of the lower courts it is
believed the petroleum questions
would be settled satisfactorily for all
concerned until congress enacts pend
ing legislation.
An "amparo," for which there Is no
English equivalent, is a sort of habeas
corpus extended to property rights. If
the "amparoa," in these cases are
granted executions of the oil decrees
objected to would be held up.
MEXICO SENATE TAKES UP OIL
MEXICO CITY, Aug. 15. The Ben
ate today decided to begin immediate
ly to discuss questions of oil legisla
tion and the development of article 27
of the constitution under -which the
petroleum industry would be nation
alized. The usual process has been
for the senate to wait for measures to
be passed by the lower house, but in
view of the fact that the lower house
has pot taken up the oil and oil land
problem since May 1, the senate lead
ers decided to hasten action concern
ing it.

Twenty Republicans Added to
Democrats Will Pass With
Reservations; White House
Is Still Against Any Changes
WASHINGTON, Aug. 15. Negotia

of the peace treaty with reservations

together on unprecedented measures.

discussion of the treaty next Tuesday
at the White House.
Democratic leader, feeling out sen-f
timent on the Republican side, were
told that the treaty never could be
ratified without qualifications, but
that more than 20 Republicans want
ed to see it accepted in the near fu
ture, with reservations along the
line of those agreed on by seven sen
ators of that party some days ago.
Poll Shows Sufficient Strength.
This information came from mem
bers of the groutf of seven after com
pletion of a poll begun Wednesday
on receipt of the first Democratic ov
ertures'. The 20 needed by the Demo
crats to make the necessary ratifica
tions majority of 64, had not accepted
the proposed reservations program in
exact form, it was asserted, but ha
given their assent to its general pro
visions. Senator Hitchcock, the Democratic
leader, went to the White House and
is understood to. have laid the whole
senate situation before the president.
He made no formal announcement
after the conference but indicated
that the administration stand for
unreserved ratifications remained un
changed. Some of the, seven reserva
tion Republicans, however, insist
that they have had information assur
ing Democratic assent i to their pro
gram. Lodge Has Yet Another Plan.
A new draft of reservations was
shown to several Republicans during
the day by Senator Lodge, the Repub
lican leader. It is understood to cover
the four points embraced in the pre
gram agreed on by the seven senators
and includes also a provision that ap
pointment of the American represen
tative on the league of nations coun
cil must have senate approval. The
other four provisions relate to the
Monroe doctrine, withdrawal from
membership, jurisdiction over purely
domestic questions, and the right ol
congress to declare war under article
ten of the league covenant.
Plans for the White House confer
ence Tuesday were virtually complet
ed during the day, with an agreement
that both White House and commit
tee stenographers should be present
aud that a transcript of the discus
sions should be issued to the press.
Chairman Lodge also gave his assent
to the presence of newpaper corre
spondents at the meeting, but said
this was also a question for the presi
dent to decide. The proposal that
stenographers be present came froril
the president in reply to a request
that the committee members should
not be restrained to secrecy about
the discussions.

As Quickest and Least Expensive Way to Arrive at Justice
And End Litigation, and Justice Jack Agrees; August 25th
Set As Date to Begin Joint Hearing of 200 Remaining Cases
(Special to The Review.)
DOUGLAS, Aug. 5 Upon their own
request 49 residents of the Warren dis
trict were this morning in the local
Justice court bound over to the su
perior court for trial on charges of
kidnapping, growing out of their al
leged participation in the deporta
tions that followed the I. W. W. trou
ble at Bisbee two years ago. All of
the defendants in the 'group, except
ing five who are at present out ot
the state, were present when their
cases were bound over and their
bonds of $2000 each, furnished when
they were arrested several weeks
ago, were renewed.
Fifteen minutes before court open
ed Justice Jacks little court room
was crowded with defendants, their
friends and witnesses, and half a doz
en extra chairs had to be placed in
side the railing to accommodate the
ittorneys for the defense. If the spec
ators expected to hear any sensa
tional arguments they were disap
pointed. Hardly had court been open
ed when Attorney W. H-- Burges of
El Paso, chief counsel for the defense.
arose and made the following state
ment for the 49 defendants:
States Position of Defense.
"If the court pleases: The taking
of testimony in the first 49 cases has
now occupied the attention of this
court for the greater part of five
weeks. The transcript -of that testi
mony is more than 1500 typewritten
pages.
"The consideration of that testi
mony to the end that exact justice be
done each individual defendant,
would impose an enormous amount
ot work on the court and probably,
to no ultimate good.
"It is the deliberate Judgment ot
all the counsel for the defendants
that on the records which have been
made, no final judgment could be
rendered except judgments of not
guilty.
"Counsel are aware, however, that
under the law, no action or judg-(
ment of this court could foreclose
other or further action by the county
attorney.
"It is of the utmost importance to
the county and the state and to all
the people therefore as well as to these
defendants, that an end, and the right
and just end, should come to this liti
gation, and that as promptly as isj
practical.
"To the accomplishment of that

day. The campaign will begin immedi
ately, it was Indicated, and will be
pressed to the limit. The officers at

ot the department of justice in Ari-;
zona and two assistant United States
district attorneys. United States JMs-,
trlct Attorney Thomas A. Flynn, pre
sided. Co-operation of every citizen was in
vited in the campaign, all persons
having knowledge of practices tend
ing to raise food costs being urged to
report the facts to the nearest federal
officer. Numerous complaints already
received at the district attorney's of
fice were discussed. As an instance of
what these indicated Mr. Flynn
gave out the following:
"A particular subject of inquiry
will be held in the Miami mining dls
trict where the retail price of butter
was, immediately upon the announce
ment ot the increases in miners'
wages, enhanced from 56 cents a
pound to 72 cents."
Mr. Flynn, in a formal statement,
announced that he believed existing
law, particularly the war time food
control act, provided means adequate
at least to some action, and that he
proposed to invoke it wherever pos
sible to bring to justice food hoard
ers and profiteers.
"This is but a sample of the con

preliminary examinations and pre
sent themselves to the court that if
may bind them over to await such ac
tion in the superior court as the state
may desire to take and to abide such
other action as this court may se
proper to make in the premises."
Attorney Burges then stated that
counsel for the defense had taken
the liberty of preparing bonds foi
each of the defendants, with a few
exceptions, and that the defendants
were in court prepared to give such
bond if the court granted their re
quest that their cases be continued
to the superior court.
Questioned by the court if he had
any objection to this, the county at
torney said he had "none on earth,"
and added:
Says Defense Saves Expenses.
"Knowing 4he eminent counsel who
represent the defendants, this is not
unexpected by me. I expected them
to do just what they have done and
I am glad they have done it. It saves
time aud trouble and expense and ev
erything else. Now it is true that
they have waived all technical ques

DEPORTATION CASES ARE BOUND
OVER AT THEIR OWN REQUEST
(Continued from Pact One)
hearings are being held, said:
"It has been the intention of the
court since , the beginning, without
reference er consideration to his feel
ings in this matter, to give each de
fendant, a fair. and impartial trial, to
demand courtesy and respect from)
the lawyers toward the witnesses, i
also from the witnesses toward the
lawyers, with due respect from all to-
ward the court. While the court
considers from every standpoint that!
the defendants have had a fair trial,
they have" been allowed every priv-l
ilege granted them by the law, and I
might say that, with the consent of;
the prosecuting attorney, we have giv
en them, in certain cases. Just a lit
tle the best of it, but it was the idea
of -the court and the prosecuting at
torney and all connected, to go into
this matter with the sole purpose that
justice should be done towards the j
state as well as the defendants, and .1 '
believe that it has been done and
that justice will be meted out in the
future towards the defendants as they
shall deserve. j
"The court is going to consider the
motion just made by the defense;
is going to bind the defendants oveij
as requested by him; is going to place
their bond the same as it now stands,
at $2000, for their appearance before
the superior court when called on.
While I might state that mylelf as
well as some of the others expected
to hear some very flowery speeches
today, the court, to a certain extent,
feels honored as it believes that' in
no justice court before in the state
of Arizona has there been Buch an
array of legal talent. I believe that
the legal profession is represented in
this court by the brightest men of the
state or the west today and I believe
that the majority here are going to be I

Special Train For
Deportations
Defendants
Arrangements have been made to
run a special train daily beginning
Aug. 25th for the defendants in the
deportation cr.se s from Bisbee and
Lowell who must appear every day
in court r.t Douglas, where the
cases are being tried. About 200
defendants are included in one
blanket indictment,-and under the
Arizona law, each defendant must
appear daily in court to answer.
It is figured that a special train
will be the most economical way
of giving ench defendant a chance
to make the trip; An effort will be
made to have court held in the aft
ernoon only, so that the defendants
can attend to their business here
in the morning.. One of the thea
ters in Douglas will be rented as a
courtroom in order to accommodate
the crowd. The special train will
leave at noon. .

Reciting the provisions of the food
control act under which these prac
tices are unlawful, and pointing out
that heavy penalties are provided for
those convicted of infringing on the
law. the statement continued: .
"Besides the criminal prosecutions
provided for in the act, section seven
provides for the process of libel
I against the hoarded goods which if
adjudged by the court to be hoarded,
1 shall be disposed of by sale in such
; a way as to provide the most suitable
1 disposition thereof." '
1 Bringing of such libel action is
I compulsory on federal attorneys
where evidence sufficient to sustain
the action is offered them, the state
! ment declared. Mr. Flynn's state
1 ment reiterated a previous declara
j tlon that action having to do with
t the cost of living, would be given
preference over all other matters, and
made this announcement:
"The agents (of the department of
justice) have been requested by the
United States, attorney to secure the
co-operation, not only of fair price
committees but of any citizens - Who
are hoarding, price-fixing or profi
teering of any kind or character."
The statement added:
"Public sentiment has been justly
aroused at the exorbitant prices of
the necessities of life and the de
partment of justice is determined to
see what justification there is for
this, and, if none exists, to s that
'professional patriots' who takeom
the ribs of the people while paring
them on the back, shall not go un-

. "The United States attorney in
vltes the co-operation of every citizen
in the state and desires them to re
port in person or letter of any act
considered to be in violation of the
law- or the regulations that they are
under." "

Roasting Ears in Season
Every good American is revelling in
his own native dish these days liter
ally up to his ears in sweet green
corn!
No need to compete with the poets
in the praise of this most delectable
summer vegetables-only need to sug
gest the only proper , way to cook it
and still more ways to serve it.
At its best green corn is only boiled
a little in salted water. The chef at
a famous hotel serves and cooks it
this way.
Salt water to taste and bring fully j
to the boiling point. Husk the corn,
but do not remove the soft inner husk
lying directly next the grains. Put ,
the ears into the salted water, bring
to a boil again and cook rapidly for '
six minutes.
Another method is baked steamed
corn, prepared as follows:
' To prepare the corn strip back the
husks but do not remove them. Strip
off the silk, replace the husks over
the grains, and soak the ears in cold
water for two hours. Have the oven
very hot, lay the corn in a deep bak
ing or dripping pan, cover well with
a lid or another pan and steam 15
minutes. Send -the corn to the table
hot and covered with a napkin.
Corn Pudding ;
Choose 6 ears of fresh, tender green
corn, and score the rows down the
center and grate it from the cob. Beat
the whites and yolks of 2 eggs sepa

free and Bimple mining; camp, the atmosphere of rough-and-ready,
happy-go-lucky nelghborliness, may be lost when we
nnally yield, as yield we must, to inexorable progress and
nail up numbers on our houses like they do "back east." But what
we lose In color and atmosphere will be more than offset by the ad
vantages It will bring to the householder, the people he does business
with and the ones "outside" to whom he writes or who write to him.
Rather reluctantly. It is true, but none the less surely, the men
who have helped make Blsbee at last have gotten around to the
house numbering problem. "Problem" is right in Bisbeer, because of
certain peculiarities you may have noticed in the way of our streets
are laid out.
There is no formal or stereotyped mathematical exactitude in the
angle at which our-ayenu.es and boulevards converge. In fact, to the
aviator flying over, a birdseye view must present a picture that would
idelight a futurist. But while we may appreciate this unconven
tional arrangement of our streets and the airy way our houses are
superimposed, one above the other on the verdant hillsides, this
hanging-garden effect does not simplify the task of the house-num-berer.
However, archeologlsts have learned that the cliffdwellers in
centuries gone by had perfected a house-numbering system, and
what the cliff-dwellers could do we can do right here in Bisbee
Go on with the house-numbering. This is a city, not an Alfred
,-THenry Lewis mining camp. The numbers may seem stronge at
first, but we can get used to anything.
' "UNCLE HENRY'S" LIBEL SUIT
BOTH sides profess themselves satisfied with the verdict re
turned yesterday by the Michigan jury which decided that
Henry Ford's reputation had been damaged to the extent of
six cents when the Chicago Tribune called him an anarchist.
Mr. Ford's counsel said the millionaire gas engine genius was satis
fied because he had been .vindicated and that no money reimburse
ment was wanted. The lawyer lor the Tribune said he was satis
fied because Mr. Ford's lawyer in his closing argument to the jury
declared that they would only be satisfied with a verdict for sub
stantial damages. t
It is probable that the real truth lies somewhat distant from these
after-the-battle statements of apposing counsel. Mr. Ford cannot well
feel pleased with the finding by twelve of his peers that he, a multi
millionaire through his own efforts, comes within six cents of being
an anarchist. And the Tribune's editors and owners manifestly can
not be satisfied with the verdict when their whole defense was an
effort to prove the truth of their charge that Ford is a disciple of the
red flag.
The. men who really should be "satisfied" with the verdict
comprise the little army of editors and publishers who have felt
the evils of gag rule in antiquated and reactionary libel laws and
who, through the years, have seen the steady decline of the libel
suit's former popularity. There always has been and always will be
adequate relief for the victims of mendacious and malicious criminal
libel. But everyone who reads the newspapers knows that time and
again, repeatedly and continuously, our libel laws have been used
for ulterior purposes to vent personal spleen, to further political
ambitions and to supress the truth.
The Ford libel suit has attracted world-wide' attention, second
only to that aroused when Theodore Roosevelt sued a Michigan edi
tor for libel as the result of a statement' appearing in print that the
colonel didn't handle his liquor well. The verdict In that case paral
leled the one in the Ford suit. In reality both were "Scotch verdicts."
the jury sidestepping the real issue and finding the defendants to all
intents and purpose "not guilty, but don't do it again."
In our own state we have been highly diverted by a 'former
high official's efforts to send two editors to prison forimpunging
his patriotism. This case. too. fell flat its only result an amusing
addition to the gaiety of nations.
The hand writing is plain. The libel suit is falling into the dis
repute it deserves. The truth is the very breath on which a news,
paper lives and in a free country it will never be suppressed, libel
suits or no libel suits.
The libel suit is just one of the many annoying but harmless
maladies which journalism is "outgrowing."

BACK ON THE FARM
HEY.Old Timers, come on DacK tc me iarm:

of bed by an unfeeling alarm clock about 3 a. ra. to milk the
cows just as the Bun was peeping over the horizon and
you were bo dawgone sleepy you some time started at the wrong end
of the cow to milk? You wouldn't recognize the task of milking now
on the farm. They do it all by machinery on lots of farms nowadays

And do you remember the good old time barn dance' when the
folks came in their rigs from miles around and cavorted around on
the barn floor amid the wailing of one-stringed violin played by a
man with no ear for music and the occasional neighing of horses
and sounds of unrest from the cattle? You wouldn't recognize the
old time barn dance now. They tun up the rug on the front piazza,
slip on the latest jazz record and dance.
And say old timers, remember the good old days when you took
your best girl for a buggy ride on a moonlit night and draped the
reins around the whip while the old nag jogged along peaceful and
quiet? Nobody on the road to disturb you just you and your girl
and the moonlight. Now when you take your best girl for a ride
on a farm, you unloose the flivver from a concrete garage, buzz into
the city, see a picture show and scoot home at forty miles an hour,
taking care not to bust into any of the other cars congesting the
traffic enroute home.

your trip, wili be that it seems like a trip to the city nowadays to

MIAMI ORDERS TWO CARS
OF SURPLUS ARMY FOOD.
MIAMI, Aug. 15. When the Labor
Union committee totalled up the or
ders at the town hall last night, it was
found that 84,166 pounds of provisions
had been ordered by citizens of Miami
from army stores which the govern
ment had offered the people. This is
net weight, exclusive of the contain
ers, and it is estimated that it will re
quire two large 50,000 pounds cars to
bring the food to Miami. When tne
movement was started it was a ques
tion in the minds of many whether
enough orders would come In volun
tarily for a full car and this response
in so short a time was a surprise even
to the committe of labor men and wo
men who handled the matter.
Then he wiped his perspiring pink
lace, "just picked them this morning,
and they're good."
"How's your cotton," asked Mr.
Moore.
"Just got an offer of $10,000," said
the farmer, James Ewing, casually.
"This year I think I'll buy."
' Three years ago James Ewing drove
into Tucson. He had just $2.37 ca3h
capital, a span of mules, four children
and a wife, and lie was looking for
ward, out of the wreck of fortune up
in Montana, for farming land.
"The land I took had a house on it.
The family worked with me. My cot
ton is estimated this year by the uni
versity to be a bale to the acre and
a chance for a second bale. At the
present price it is worth $400 per bale,
or $800 per acre. I have all the water
I want. I made $400 per acre last
i year. Ten acres or corn gave me 7 a
bushels per acre and I sold it green
for $5 per bushel. Melons bring me
$200 per acre. Hadn't it been for the
rains I would have cleared $?00 per
acre.
' I've got chickens, 108 of them, and
they gave me 408 eggs and we ate
what we wanted. I got 400 friers
worth from six bits to $1 and I've got
two cows that give me two pounds
of butter per day. No, the high cost
of living doesn't affect me.

pose of surveying potential irrigated
lands. The reason for not levying for
the entire amount being that congress
did not provide its share ofcthe money.
It was decided though, to levy for
$50,000 on the ground that no more
than that amount can be spent during
the remainder of the year, and it Is
possible that congress may tike ac
tion in the case before the end of its
present session. '
The commission also -decided to set
the first and third Tuesdays of each
month as its regular meeting time.
A plan has been proposed by the U.
S. geological survey to appropriate
$10,000 to be used jointly with funds
of the state for the survey of possible
irrigated lands. This proposition was
taken under consideration by the commission.
MARICOPA COUNTY TAX
RATE FIXED AT 72 CENTS
PHOENIX, Aug. 15. The taxes of
the inhabitants of this part of tne
world are going to be considerably
higher this year. The board of super
visors yesterday fixed the rate at 7J
cents, aa against 55 cents last year,
following the Increase of the state tax
rate by 21 cents. The city rate is 1.06.
The increas$e in the county rate is
made necessary to meet the interest
on the $4,000,000 bond issue and for
the interest on the bonds of the spe
cial McDowell and Central avenue
road districts, which indebtedness was
assumed by the county under the new
county road legislation.
Other unusual expenses have been
incurred since the last tax rate was!Ag;ia prjeta
fixed, such as the light on tne nu.
The final fixing up of the duplicate
tax roll shows that the valuation on
property in this county, for taxable
purposes is $100,656,607, an increase
of more than $2,000,000 over the valu
ation of a year ago. ;
CAMPAIGN IN AGUA
PRIETA WARMING UP.
DOUGLAS, Aug. 15. With the near
approach of August 31, the date on
which all municipalties in Sonora will
elect 'presidentes municipales for the
ensuing year, interest in the campaisn
in Agua Prieta is increasing daily.
There are four candidates. They are
Jorse Gabriel Trujillo, former local
judge, and now civil judge; Arturo
Menaoza. merchant; Fernando Memio-
za, immigration agent; Lt. Col. Abra
ham traijo, who resides, at Agua
Prieta, but has a big ranch at Fron-
teras.
It is generally conceded that the
race is between the two men first
mentioned, that is, Trujillo and Arturo
Mendoza, but which of them has the
edge it is hard to say. Trujillo is
stronger in Agua Prieta, while Men
doza is stronger in the rest of the mu
nicipality. An exceedingly close race
is looked for. Both of the leading can
didates are making a hard campaign
Unlike the system in America, a

CUTTING WILD HAY IS
RESUMED NEAR JEROME.
JEROME, Aug. 15. That ancient in
dustry of cutting wild hay along the
Verde river and Oak creek Js likely
to be revived this year. C. S. Chick,
of Cornville, and J. S. Smith, of Cot
tonwood, are planning to take a com
plete haying outfit, including a mower,
rake and baler, to Grasshopper flat,
White flat, Big Park and other places
where the wild grasses grow thick.
As a result of the June and July
rains, the ranges in this part of the
state are in far better shape than
they have been for many years. Gal
leta and gramma grass, as well as
various annual grasses, are every
where waist high. Cattle are as tat
as the proverbial butter balls but they
simply cannot make an impression on
the feed. There is enough feed on
the ranges to support three or four
times as much stock as they support
in an average year.
In pioneer days cutting wild hay for
the military posts was something of
an industry in this part of Arizona.
Thousands of tons were sold at Camp
Verde when soldiers were stationed
there. The custom in those times was
to cut the grass with sharp hoes and,
of course, it was never baled. Chick
and Smith plan to go after it in the
modern way. with mowing machine
and baler:

Suspect Arrested
Here After Search
Of Over 6 Months
Following a hunt of over six
months, the long arm of Uncle Sam
reached out yesterday afternoon and
seized one C. A. Plumb on a charge
of attempting to cross the Mexican
border without a passport. Plumb
waived examination before United
States Commissioner Tayl and was
held in bonds of $1,000.
The alleged offense was committed
sometime in February near Nogales.
Plumb made a getaway at that time
and officers have been seeking for
him since then.
A few days ago the man was lo
cated on description while working at
the Southwest plant in this city. He
was taken into custody- yesterday by
Deputy U. S. Marshal J. F. Wilmot
and lodged in the county jail.
It is thought probable that Plumb
will be unable to furnish bonds and
will be taken to Tucson to await trial.
The preliminary hearing of Francis
Orloff, who was apprehended Thurs
day on a similar complaint will be
held Monday before Commissioner
Taylor.
The maximum penalty for attempt
ing" to cross the border without a
passport is $10,000 fine and five years
in prison.

RAILROAD CRAFTSMEN ARE
PLANNING FOR FEDERATION.
DOUGLAS. Aug. 15. Representa

El Paso and Southwestern railway
held a special meeting at El Paso to
formulate plans for the organization
of a system federation of all the shop
employes on the road from Tucum
cari, N. M., to Tucson, Arizona.
The system federation is to be ef
fected at once and plans were dis
cussed for calling a convention of the
federation at an early date for the pur
pose of perfecting the organization.
This convention will be attended by
representatives of the various crafts
from all points over the E. P. & S. W.
system. It is likely that El Paso, be
ing a central point, will be chosen as
the place for this meeting.
The following railroad shop crafts
will be represented in the system fed

A JOLT.
Springfield Republican.
The election of a Republican, popu
lar soldier though he .be. over the
Democratic candidate for Congress in
the Sth Kentucky district, is a jolt
to the Wilson administration. No
Republican was ever elected from
that district to the house before. As
a by-election it counters the effect
of the Republican loss of an old-time
stronghold in Pennsylvania last
March.
PERTINENT QUESTIONS.
New York Tribune.
The railroads must be run. But
will the brotherhoods take a lease on
the terms x they have held others
should submit to? Will they agree
that rateB are to be made by the in
tersta'e commerce commission?
Will they permit their wages to be
fixed according to the method of the
Adamson law? Will they pay a fair
rental for the leased property Hud be
batibtied with what is left?
S. Stone, chief of the Brotherhood oi
Locomotive Engineers, referred to
the brotherhood plan for taking over
the operation of the railroads as "in
dustrial democracy." With due re
spect to Mr. Stone, it is not industrial
democracy at all. lt is merely a
new form of class industry in which
the public provides the capital and
the workers take the profits.
FAMILIAR ARROGANCE.
New York Sun.
It was Woodrow Wilson who made
the bargains, who consented to the
com promises, who bartered with the
diligent plenipotentiaries of other
powers. It was Woodrow Wilson
who initiated and concluded Ameri
can undertakings in Paris without
one iota of authority. And it is
Woodrow Wihson and Woodrow Wil
son alone who now demands with ar
rogance, that would be amazing to
us were we not familiar with his
methods the ratification, of his acts
without explanation or enlighten
ment as to their origin or history.
Secretary Lansing is amiable and in
rtiiKtrinns. He must have had a
! rrparv time in Paris. 'SATURDAY, AUGUST 1G, 1919.

THE GRAIN MARKETS
CHICAGO. Aug. 15. I ndipatlona
that as a result of yesterday's sharp
break in prices rural holders of grain
would attempt as much as practicable
to withhold offerings led to" an up
ward swing of values todav in the rorn
market. Closing quotations were firm,
hhC to 2V4C net higher, with Sentemhor
$1.85 to S1.85U and December S1.4R!
to $145&. Oats gained IVic to 11. c.
and provisions 12c to 75c. Advances
in the corn market were nreceded hv
sharp new declines which carried the
may aenvery down to the lowest point
yet for the crop.
This setback was largely dun tn an
accumulation of selling orders before
trading began and great activity in
pressing measures to reduce the cost
of living. Shorts who were in a posi
tion to collect profits, started buying,
however, and were followed by com
mission houses when evidence multi
plied that country holders did not pro
pose to rush shipments at a sacrifice.
Oats showed independent strength.
Bidding was urgent for the kinds need
ed by Europe.
Buying that was ascribed to packers
rallied provisions despite big new cuts
in the value of hogs.

TS
IJ. K.ONBISBEF
PHOENIX. Aug. 15.' When it
comes to a matter of writihg laws
that will receive the okey of the
DAIRYING
attorney general's office, L. B. Whit
ney is there.
Whitney was at one time city at-J
torney for Bisbee, and as such drew
up a milk ordinance imposing;
stringent regulations upon the dairy-i
men. Whitney now occupies the po
sition of first assistant to the attor
torney general and as such the ord
inance in question was put up to him
for his approval.
Dairymen File Complaint.
Was there anything wrong with
this ordinance and especially, in view
of the fact that it i3 in conflict with
the state law? This was what Dairy
Commissioner W. A. Barr wanted
to know. He called attention to the
fact that the Bisbee ordinance calls
for a solid content of 12 per cent
and that the milk shall come from
tuberculin tested cows, while the
state law is silent on these points.
The ' dairymen were complaining
about the situation, said Barr, and
wanted to know who was right, the
state or the city authorities if the
matter came to a show-down.
In reply Whitney has written a
letter in which he states that the
Bisbee ordinance is all right, and to
prove It he admits that he wrote it
himself. The ordinance in question,
he says, was based on technical data
furnished by Miss Jane Rider, state
bacteriologist of Tucson. Dr. Dur
fee, city bacteriologist of Bisbee and
Dr. Herendjeen. Bisbee city health
officer, and at the time he consider
ed the requirements as reasonable.
As to the law in" the matter he says:
City Has Power.
"As to whether a city ord.ina.nce
can be enforced which conflicts wltS
our state dairy law, let me say thak
where the power to pass such an
ordinance Is granted the city by
charter of general law, such an or
dinance can be enforced notwith
standing the fact that it fixed a dif
ferent standard for milk than the
state law.
"It is my opinion that the city of
Bisbee . had the power to pass an
ordinance regulating the standards
of milk sold or offered for sale in
that city, and that such an ordinance
can be enforced despite the fact
that the standard required exceeds
that prescribed by the 6tate law."

with Eddie Shannon.
A scribe on the San Francisco Ex

highly. He says: "Eddie Shannon,

Coroner James Allison this morning
will hold an Inquest to decide re
sponsibility for the accident which
yesterday resulted in the death of
Rudolfo Alvarado, aged seven, of 169
Naco Road. The boy was struck and
almost instantly killed by an automo
bile driven by Oscar Langbein. The
Inquest will be at 9 o'clock.
Different stories as to how the acci
dent happened, told by Langbein and
Thomas Henry who was in the car
with him, and by other eye witnesses,
will be sifted.
The fatality took place on the road
to Lowell opposite the Slag Dump
garage yesterday morning. Langbein
says that young Alvaradewas riding
on the back of a loaded wagon and
jumped off directly in the path of the
auto just as be was about to pass.
Other witnesses say the boy was not
riding on the wagon but darted from
behind it and attempted to cross In
front of the auto.
All agree that Langbein's car was
moving at a slow rate of speed and
that the accident was practically un
avoidable. The boy's skull was frac
tured. He died before he could be
rushed to the C. & A. hospital.
The funeral, which is in charge of
the Hennessy Undertaking company.
will probably be held today.

this section in some wepks. The boor.e
was in a seven-passenger Hupmobile
car belonging to a womaii named May
Joiner and was found at her home in
South Bifcbee.
r Late Thursday night the deputies
jrot a "tip" lhal KicUlt-r, who made his
escape near Hereford last week after
being arrested by Deputy Sheriff
Harry Rarferiy with a carload of
whiskey, w-as at. the Joiner woman's
house,- known as the Charlie Olson
hlace. They surrounded the plabe, but
Instead of capturing Kidder they found
the carload of whiskey.
The Joiner woman and a man
named Paul Kuntz, said to be Kid
der's brother-in-law, were arrested.
Deputy Sheriff Foster drove over to
Tombstone with Kuntz and the whis
key early yesterday morning. Kuntz
and the Joiner woman were released
on bonds of $500.
Kidder has been in trouble before
and the officers have been searching
for him ever since he escaped from
Rafferty near Hereford. Kidder was
driving the car at the time, with Raf
ferty beside him. Seizing the oppor
tunity he gave the car a throttle full
of gas and jumped out. By the time
Rafferty seized the wheel and got the
car under control, Kidder had disap
peared. The Olson house where the Joiner
woman was arrested, has long been
suspected as a rendezvous and supply
point for bootleggers. At one time
there is said to have been 300 cases
of whiskey cached there. Thursday
night, however, was the first time that
any one' has been "caught with the
goods." ' '
