(By Review Leased Wire)
WASHINGTON, Not. 18 Presi
dent Wilson will attend the open
ing sessions of the peace confer
ence. Thia was announced to
night officially. He will go im
mediately after the convening of
the regular session of congress on
December 2.
This official statement was, issued
at the White House:
The president expects to sail for
France immediately after the opening
of the regular session of congress for
the purpose of taking part in the dis
cussion and settlement of the main
features of the treaty of peace. It is
not likely that it will be possible for
him to remain throughout the ses
sions of the formal peace conference,
but his presence at the outset Is neces
sary in order to obviate the manifest
disadvantanges of discussion by cable
In determining the greater outlines of
the final treaty about which he must
necessarily be consulted. He will, o
course, be accompanied by delegates
who will sit as the representatives
of the United States throughout the
conference.
"The names of the delegates-will be
presently announced."
How long the president will remain
abroad he himself probably cannot
eay now. The time for the convening
of the peace conference has not yet
been announced, but the general belle
here is that it cannot be assembled
before late in December at the earli

dent will be absent from the country

longer.

LONDON, Nov. 18. The first Amer
ican troops to depart homeward as a
reeult of the signing of the armistice
will be 18,000 men stationed in Eng
land. The American army expects to
tart the first ehlpload of these sol
diers homeward within a week and to
have all the men on their way back
to the United States ten days later.
The plans for clearing England of
American troops are incomplete, but
It is desired to remove these men im
mediately as some shipping is avail
able for this purpose. Most of the
18.000 men are helping the British air
forces.
The American hospital units will be
left In England until a policy for ear
ing for future cases of Illness among
the Americans has been decided upon.
The belief Is expressed at army
headquarters that very few Americans
will be left Ion in England, as it is
thought that the hospitals in France
will suffice for future seeds.

and More Expected
Reports of united war work cam

me v. m. U. A. put me aismci again i
"over the top." More than 10 perj
cent subscription was the result ol
the final tabulation, showing a total
of pledges of $57,390.48. At the end
of the two days remaining campaign
it is anticipated thia sum will have
been Increased several hundreds of
dollars.
Called on again the district has re
sponded willingly and freely. In four
liberty loans now the district has
oversubscribed. In Red Cross drives,
campaigns for the Y. M. C. A.. Y. W.
C. A., Knights of Columbus, Belgian
relief, and other causes, the residents
of the multiple cities of the Mule
mountains have replied with hearty
good will and a surplus of funds. The
united war work campaign has been
another victory in the war for the
district, and when workers last night
saw the final figures totalled on the
boards, they cheered long and loud.
Prior to the receipt of reports the
women of the district who have had
in hand the luncheons served a ban
quet as a closing tribute to the work
ers. The banquet was followed by
the reading by team captains of their
total subscriptions. As the figures

As the reports were received several
teams announced that their records
are not yet complete, and that they
will have additional funds to swell
their totals before the close of the
two remaining days of the campaign.
It is anticipated that these additions
will raise the district's total to near
$58,000.
The total reported at the meeting
last night represents more than 150
per cent of the minimum requested
when the drive opened, and a little
more than the Increased demands
which were made on every part of the
nation when the armistice was signed.
Originally this district was assigned
to raise $37,500. When peace loomed
suddenly leaders In the welfare work
for soldiers foresaw larger demands
on the seven agencies of the united
war work, and Immediately asked tbe
entire nation to oversubscribe 50 per
cent. This raised the district's quota
to $56,200. Workers were advised
that this total must be raised, and
the district responded with the same
willingness and sacrifice which has
marked its giving In all past cam
paigns. As en example of the manner In
which the residents of the district
have sacrificed to support the cam
paign. Chairman J. C. Ryan last night
called the attention of the workers to
the gift of Dad and Mother Stetson.
Dad Stetson Is now operating a jit
ney in the district. Each be and his
wire gave $5 to the united war work
campaign. They have already given
four sons, who are now In France.
In behalf of the workers of the
Shattuck and Denn mines It was an
nounced at the meeting that these or

LONDON, Sunday, Nov. 17 (British

the greatest naval surrender which
the world has ever witnessed.
A great fleet of German battle
ships, battle cruisers and light cruis
ers and destroyers will leave port
Monday morning at 5 o'clock for an

sunk off Falkland Islands by the Brit

sunk or that new ships have been
built to replace them.
NO OFFICIAL REPORT
WASHINGTON, Nov. 18. There
was no announcement here today re
garding the delivery of the fleet of
battleships, battle cruisers and light
cruisers which Germany was required
under the terms of the armistice to
surrender today to the associated na
tions. Nor was there any Informa
tion as to the names of the ports at
which the vessels were to be interned.
There was much speculation as to
the final disposition of the ships, but
in the absence of any official informa
tion, many officers thought that this
matter would be left until Ihe peace
conference meets. The armistice pro
vided that the vessels were to be dis
armed before they left Germany and
that tbey were to be interned at neu
tral or allied ports as the associated
governments might direct with only
care takers on board.
Publication of the names of the bat
tleships and cruisers were designated
by the associated governments, re

WAR COST TOTAL
ITS GREATNESS
Now Amounts to 175 Billions
and Will Reach 200 Bil-
" lions Before End of Year
Is, Estimated
(By Review Leased Wire)
WASHINGTON, Nov. 18. The
direc sosfc of the war for all
belligerents to last May 1 was
reported at about $175,000,000,000
by the federal reserve board bul
letin, issued today, and it is esti
mated the cost will amount to
nearly $200,000,000,000 before the
end of this year. These calcula
tions were compiled by the board
from various sources and while
their accuracy is not vouched for,
the board believes the figures
are substantially correct.
For purely military and naval
purposes it is estimated that all
belligerent had spent about
$132,000,000,0110 to ?day 1, or
about three-fourths of the total
war cost. The balance represent
ed interest on debt and other in
direct war expenses.
How the cost amounted from
year to year is illustrated by tab
ulations showing that the mobili
zation and the first five months
of the war cost all belligerents
about $10,000,000,000. In 1913
the expenses jumped to $26,000,
000.000; in 1916 they increased to
$C8.000.000,000 and in 1917 tney
were estimated at $60,000,000,000.
This year's expenses have run a
little above last year's rate.
About $150,000,000,000 of the
total war cost has been raised by
war loans of various nations and i
comparatively little by taxation. '
The public debt of the principal
entente allies is calculated at ap
proximately $105,000,000,000. or
more than twice as much as the
aggregate debt or the central
powers, set at $45,000,000,000.
This does not take into consider
ation debt incurred since last
May.

Mapping Your .
ree
glh
It is impossible for anyone with an acid-stomach
to be well and strong, i ecause acid-stomach, sour
stomacb as most people call it a condition that doc
tors name supeiacidity is due to excess acid which
is absolutely harmful. Every one knows acid-mouth
ruins the teeth and gums and although you cannot
taste this acid still it is strmig enoifgh to eat away
the 'larder-tlian-bone enamel on the tef th. and cause
them to deca.
What then, must be the action of too much acid
upon the delicate organization of the stomach! Sure
ly you must realize that such a condition, if not
corrected, will weaken and undermine one's health.
But have you really any idea of the great numhei
of ai'ments that are directly traceable to acid
stcmach? Few people have. When they are bilious,
or have severe headache, or an attack of indigestion,
or rheumatism, lumbago or sciatica; or when they
beciu to feel run down and are nervous and men
tally depressed: or have dizzy spells, vertigo and
pains around the heart little do they think it may
have its origin in an acid-stomach.
And then there are thousands yes. millions of
peoplo w'io, without having any well defined ail
ment, are always complaining. They can't say ex
actly what Is the matter with them. All they can
tell ycu is that they "don't feel ripht." are "all in.
tired, sickly." And just to look at them you know
tlicy vru tellitiK the truth.
llr-.v can they "feel rifeht" when the chances are

but surely, day by day. making digestion more 'and
more difficult, causing food io sour and ferment in
tho intestinal tract, filling their systems with pois
ons? For that ts exactly what excess acid super
acidity does. It prevents one from (;etii:!g lull
strtngth out of his food.
Is it any wondi-r then, tlmt llii re are so many
people w ho. while not downright su k, show plainly
in face, figure and action that they aie nnything but

A wonderful modern remedy now makes it pos
sible to rid the stomach of its excess acid without
the slightest discomfort. It is called EATONIC
a compound in tablet form. EATONIC Tablets are
good to eat they taste like candy. Eat one or
two of these tablets after each meal and you will
notice a wonderful difference my, what a differ
ence! What amazingly quick relief EATONIC does
surely bring! It literally wipes out the excess acid
and immediately relieves bloat, heart burn, belch

pain3 of indigestion. It makes the stomach cool
and comfortable keeps it sweet and strong. You
can eat what you like and digest your food in com
fort without fear of distressing after effects. It helps
you get full strength out of every mouthful you eat
and that is what yon must have to be well and
strong full strength from your food.
Begin using EATONIC right now today and
get on the road to bounding, vigorous, vibrant health.
No matter what medicines or treatments you have
tried in a vain attempt to throw ofr that dull, tired,
listless feeling those aches and pains those se
vere attacks of headache that nervousness and in
somnia don't give up hope. You haven't tried
EATONIC. Look to your acid-stomach. See if that
isn't the real seat of your physical ailments.

Statistics show that soldiers in all armies
are eating more and more candy. British
army officers say that their men have
eaten five times the candy expected.
Candy went into this war considered by many people a luxury, but it
is now firmly established as a great food for men who work hard.
Candy produces heat and energy for muscular work. It is a very
desirable, quick fuel-food and is more rapidly oxidized than other food.
Candy, esprcially when it contains both fruit and nuts, can supply
the system with both calories of heat and energy, and protein foods
for material growth and repair.
Scientists tell us that during vioient exercise the system draws very
heavily on its natural rrat or "body fuel." The heavier one's work
the more the system requires the stored bp energy in a pound of good
canjiy.
The U. S. Food Administration recognizes candy as a healthful fooi.
It also knows that the candy industry is a big national asset and
that it is the duty of every on? to HELP KEEP INDUSTRIES GOING
AT HOME TO WIN THE WAR.
So candy manufacturers are allowed a fixed amount of sugar,
you see candy on sale you may buy it and enjoy It and it
gsod for you if eaten in moderation.

The Victory Hoys of the Warren
district are not lagging in the race to
raise funds for the united war work
campaign. Far from it, they have
added materially to the sums pledged
to the great cause. Many of the boys
have pledged $5. All are to earn the
money in some way.
The hoys are not backward about
poing out to seek the jobs, either.
They are selling papers, shining shoes,
acting as attendants in barber shops,
fathering up old tron and other
articles having a value as salvage.
There isn't any sort of job within
their capacity to perform that they
will .not tackle.
Up to date the total reported by
Chairman J. B. Potter as being

tion. Effect of the legislation, even if ap
proved by President Wilson, is the
subject of warm dispute which many
members of congress think the courts
will have to settle. The bill would
make prohibition effective "after June
30, 1919, until the conclusion of the
present war and thereafter until the
termination of demobilization, the date
of which shall be determined and pro
claimed by the president."
Senator Sheppard of Texas, author
of the prohibiton features, and other
dry champoins insist that prohibition
will go into effect on the date fixed
to continue nntil demobilization is
completed, regardless of when peacs
is proclaimed. Opponents of the leg
islation, however, declare that if peace
is declared before July 1, the bill can
not be operative, even though demo
bilization will be in progress there
after. The prohibition legislation has im
portant bearing upon the pending war
revenue bill, whose authors estlmale
an annual revenue loss of more than
$1,000,000,000 to the government, in
cluding cessation of beer and wine
manufacture, ordered December 1, by
the food administration.

THE "FLU" SITUATION

Everyone in the Warren district is anx
ious that the quarantine against the spread
of influenza be raised, and that, as soon as
possible. On Saturday morning the Re
view again printed the letter from the state
board of health, in which the seven points
were brought out, which, if instituted, may
alleviate the conditions that prevail in this
city. In any event the "flu" situation de
serves the honest, straightforward and
careful consideration of the people of this
community.
Cf the seven points noted in the letter
of the state board of health a certain per
centage of the people will object to a part
of the regulations. On the whole, how
ever, they can be carried out with no great
inconvenience. They should be instituted
in Bisbee. They should be instituted at
once.
At certain points on the Pacific coast the
use of the gauze mask has come much into
favor. In the city of San Francisco its use
was enforced, as a result the city was open
ed last Saturday night. By the use of
masks in the California city, new cases
were reduced from 2000 per day to none at
all. There can be no harm in using a mask
m any case.
With this in view, why cannot the peo
ple of the Warren district be pursuaded to
use the mask? It must be conceded that
it can do no harm and may be the cause
of doing a great deal of good. The slight
expense attached to the purchase of gauze
masks will not be a deterrent against its
use.
The business people of the district are
becoming vexed at the continuation of the
quarantine. They are in a quandry as to
what course to pursue. On the other hand,
the medical fraternity can not justly be
blamed for present conditions.
Let the physician issue an order to the
effect that every man, woman and child
in the Warren district wear a mask. Put
into effect the recommendation of the
state board of health, embodied in the let
ter. Make the quarantine rigorous for a
few days and watch the results.
Bisbee can not go on all winter in its
present condition. It is suicidal and must
be alleviated in some manner.
It is time for the authorities to act.
GRASPING FOR A STRAW
(Tucson Star.)
According to Phoenix advices, Chan
cellor Johnny Hughes is urging Fred Col
ter, the defeated democratic nominee for
governor, to contest the election of Tom
Campbell. The chancellor, according to
the report, claims to have grounds in this
county which would warrant a contest. We
fear that Johnnie is grasping at a straw and
that should he find it, he would uncover a
whole woodyard of munitions against his
own cause.
The chancellor, no doubt, has been won
dering for these many days, or since the
election, about the Campbell majority in
Pima county. He has, undoubtedly, ques
tioned himself many times as to the reason
for the slump in his favorite's stock, com
pared to the election of two years ago. we
doubt, however, that Johnnie has deter
mined the proper solution.
The registration disclosed 700 more dem
ocrats in Pima county than republicans. Yet
Tom Campbell carried the county by 633
votes. Two years ago Campbell beat Hunt
in Pirna county by 328. Why the differ
ence, in Campbell's favor, this year?
We venture to give several reasons, no
ore ol which can be traced to any personal
animosity against the democratic candi
date.
Huntism is unpopular in Pima county.
Hunt espoused the fortunes of the demo
cratic nominee.
TVee hundred and five democrats who
voted for Hunt two years ago were con
vinced of the uselessness of continuing in
office any man who could be persuaded
to follow "Sir Gallahad's" footsteps.
Colter's campaign managers merely
typified 'Huntism.
The voters wanted none of them and
voted against them rather than against the
candidate himself.
Those leaders were Johnnie Hughes, Joe
Wiley, Joe Stinson and Tom Marshall.
The voters decided that Pima county
could ill afford to take a chance on return
ing Colter to office, for that would mean
a perpetuation of Chancellor Johnnie
Hughes, of Joe Wiley, of Joe Stinson and
of T; K. Marshall.
. The democrats of Pima and Gila counties
are responsible for the orerthrow of Hunt
ism, Campbell's increased majority in this
county and Colter's decreased majority in
Gila county contributed enough and more
to make up for the decline in the Camp
bell majority in Maricopa.
If Johnnie Hughes is anxious to aid Fred
Colter, in the future, he will quit urging
a contest. Otherwise, Pima county may
again administer a political chastisement
to him that he will never forget two years
hence.
DISTRICT GOES
OVER TOP WITH
FIFTY PER CENT
A Real Catastrophe
"When Johnny comes marching home,"
is a mighty popular tune in these United
States, these days, and the words of Secre
tary Baker and General March, as they out--line
the program for demobilization have
sweet sound in the ears of the fathers and
mothers of the nation. Underlying the
heart throb, however, is the hope that the
nation will not demobilize too soon. Eu
rope, from all appearances, will take con
siderable "policing" for some time to
come.
"We will only get peace if we loyally
fulfill the conditions of the armistice," tele
graphs the new German government to the
secretary of the German navy. That's
wrong, Clarisse. You'll get peace any
way. The only difference is that in this
mode of conduct lies some slight hope for
consideration. The other way lies in the
bayonets of the allied forces which rapidly
were carving a way toward your bor
ders when you threw up the sponge.
The path trodden by the individual Ger
man in this little old world will be a stony
one, for many a day, regardless of peace
terms, agreements or pacts of other sorts.
For one thing the world will not forget
soon the stigma of the well-earned name of
"Hun." It will take generations of prob
ity to live down this title.
All the democratic candidates for the
legislature in Maricopa, belonging to the
Hunt faction of the party went down to
defeat. Only Jim Goodwin and Mrs.
Pauline O'Neil were elected on the demo
cratic ticket along with four republicans.
Some people who growl about having
to give to the war work fund should re
member that on November 1 5 coupons are
coming to them that they never would have
had if the Liberty bond campaigns had not
induced them to practice thrift.
The Hon. Mrs. Pauline O'Neil was the
only democrat elected to the legislature
from Maricopa county. The Hunt ma
chine was fighting Mrs. O'Neil, by the ma
chine organ in Phoenix.

Every little movement points to the in

road express and telegraph services.
With the ending of the war will start
the old time cutting of the pork pie. Post

Everyone in the Warren district should
respond to the urge of the united war work
committee and "give one dollar more."

the district maintained a like aver
age. In both these latter organiza
tions there are still several men to 4e
seen, who have been off work for one
reason or another, when it la probable
they will report a complete organiza

In the district 387 Victory girls sub
scribed a total of $1359.60, while in
the state 800 girls have pledged $2800.
Two hundred and eight Victory boys
in the district subscribed $1210.50, an
average of $4.30 each. These pledges
must be earned through the individ
ual efforts of the boys and girls, and
leaders of both organizations asked
that each resident of the district as

jobs and errands whenever possible.
School teachers of the district re

their record is practically perfect.

unable to attend the meeting, but in
his behalf Mr. Ryan, district chair
man, reported that Cochise county is I
now assured at least $104,444, a lit-1

THE BISBEE DAILY REVIEW, TUESDAY, NOVEMBER 19, 1918.
Mining and Financial News
BY REVIEW
NEW YORK. Nov. 18. The stock
market was in a state of suspended
animation during the greater part of
today's session, prices for tlie most
part arising and falling within circuni-
scribed, although gains prevailed at
the close.
Sentiment anions the professional
element was strongly influenced by
last week's adverse bank statement..
the reduction of actual reserves giv-
ing fresh point to the need for con-
tinued restriction of credits. Labor
problems also assumed greater prom-
inence. f
United States Steel and Marine pre -
ferred divided the honors of the day,
the former rallying easily in the last
hour from its one point decline and
closing at a substantial fractional ad -
vance, while Marine held its 4 point
rise, despite another meeting of the
directors at wnicn no progress- was
reported in the proposed sale of the
company's British tonnage.
Rails made partial recovery from
their extreme setback of 1 to 2 points,
motors and oils were irregular at best
with the several war groups and spe
cialties ftisniavinw uncertain tendeu-
....... i . o
cies. aside from Industrial Alcohol,
which rose 3 points. Sales amounted
to 500,000 shares.
Most divisions of the bond market
were disposed to ease, international
as well as Liberty issues, on a marked
falling off in dealings. Total sales,
par value, aggregated $9,600,000. Old
United States 4s gained 4 per cent
on sales and declining as much on
call.
GRAIN MARKET.
CHICAGO.N ov. 18. Sharp new ad
vances in the corn market today re
sulted chiefly from attempts to antic
ipate the price effects of the hunger
necessities of Europe. Quotations
closed firm. 2 to S"8 net higher,
with December 1.28 to 1.2SV4 and
January 1.29 to 1.30. Oats finished
IV to 21 up and provisions varied
from unchanged figures to a rise of
35c.
Reports -from London that arrange
ments were being- made for the dis
patch of a number of German vessels
to the United States to convey food
stuffs to Germany did a good deal to
give fresh impetus to speculative de
mand for corn. Despite aggressive
selling which made the market waver
at the outset, the buying broadened
out, and was intensified owing to wet
weather which threatened to retard
the domestic crop movement. Profit
taking sales caused a decided setback
later, but the fever to purchase be
came dominant again, and carried the
market higher than before. The top
lor the doy showed an extreme bulge
of more than 12 cents within a week.
Oats strengthened with corn. Hedg
ing pressure, though, checked the
gains. Besides, export bids were
somewhat out of line.
Provisions were lifted by the up
turns In grain and hogs. The tran
sient break in corn led, however, to
a reaction.

OCCUPATION
BY ALLIES IS
WELL STARTED
(Continued from Page On)
Briey numbered about 2500. Civilians
employed in the mines by the Ger
mans were paid from 4 to 6 francs a
day. The people of Briey did not
have any particular complaints tc
make of the treatment by the Ger
mans during the last two years, but
for the first two years they had dif
ferent stories to. tell of the brutalities
they suTfered.
The Germans abandoned a large
number of trucks and portable dyna
mos in Briey, owing to their haste
to withdraw their troops.
Smoke streaming from the chim
neys of many mines greeted the ad
vancing Americans early this 'morn
ing, for a number of the mines were
in actual operation and there .were
fires tinder the boilers !n other mines
so as to keep the pumps going. Sev
eral mines had been flooded by seep'
j age, having been idle for two or three
years. . The Germans had removed
the machinery for other purposes.
Most of the mines had been operat
ed until last week, when the Germans
bejran to release the Russians and
others who had been employed in this
work.

civilians greeted the vanguard of the
Second American division which
reached Montmedy shortl" before 8
o'clock Sunday morning. T!.e civilians
knew the Americans were comins,
but were surprised at the early hour
of their arrival. The Americans, like
wise, were surprised to find so many
civilians awaiting them.
Montmedy is little scarred as the
result of the war exrept tor the rail
road yard, where the bombs of Amer
ican aviators some time ago dis
placed tons of earth and tore up the
railroad. When the Americans ar
rived in Montmedy the civilians were
still at work putting up flfcgs along
the principal streets. Soon after the
excitement of the welcome was over
the Americans were surprised to see
siiopkeepers open their stores.
French flags, which had not been
unfurled for four years in Montmedy,
predominated in the scheme of dec
oration, but here and there American
flags appeared. The Americans were
at a loss to understand where they
came from until a civilian explained
that they had Jbeen made ty the
French women in anticipation of the
arrival of the Americans.
Detachments of the division spent
part of the day in Montmedy. During
the afternoon the marine band gave
a concert in the city square, which
had been renamed by the Germans
"Berliner Platz." The civilians
crowded around and embraced the
bandsmen when they finished the
concert with a rendition of "The Mar
seillaise.". Late Sunday afternoon the ad
vance columns of the Second division
started forward from Montmedy to
make room for additional units com
ing on from the west.
REFUGEES ON MOVE.
WITH THE ALHED ARMIES IN
FRANCE AND BELGIUM. Nov. 18.
(By the Associated Press.) All the
refugee 'populations who have been
freed in Belgium and France are on
the move these days, intent upon re
gaining their homes, from which
many have been separated since the
beginning of the war. Everywhere
one sees long lines of country folk
coming or going over the main roads
with their few pitifui possessions.
Almost every family group marches
cheerfully ahead, with big or little
Belgian flags flying bravely and not
a few American flags among the lot.
Many of the hamlet people are
already patching up their shattered
houses enough to keep out the rain.
Even in Dixmude the people are
already living in the cellars.
The city of Antwerp appears to have
come through the years of German oc
cupation well as compared with many
other cities, though the people suf
fered under the load of exorbitant
prices. Great preparedness have been
under way for the entry of the king
and queen and the road between
Ghent and Antwerp is beflasged.
ENTER METZ TODAY.
PARIS, Nov. IS. (British Wireless
Service.) It Is officially announced
that French troops, led by General
Petain, will enter Metz tomorrow.
Subsequently, General Castelnau and
General Mangin will follow- with their
armies.
The entry into Strasnburg. which
will be headed by Marshal Koch, will
take rlace next Sunday and Monday.
HAIG'S MEN ADVANCE.
LONDON. Nov. 18. Field Marshal
Haig's report on the advance of the
British troops says:
"The second and fourth armies con
tinued their march today. Other ad
vanced troops reached the general
line of Florennes, Charleroi, Seneffe
and Hal."
BELGIUM ADVANCE HALTS
WITH THE AMERICAN FORCES
OF OCCUPATION. Nov. 18 (By the
Associated Press). The forward
movement Into Belgium halted at 3
o'clock this afternoon when tlie ad
vancing elements of the second divis
ion entered St. Leger. A detnehment
of cavalry first entered. This was
followed a few minutes later by the
officers and the staff in cars.
A crowd of citizens had gathered
In the streets and began rolling no
the shutters of the little shops. The
church bells were rung and the mayor
and liis wife came out in front of
their homes and welcomed the offi
cers and correspondents' and invited
them to become the mayor's guests.
Women, children and aged men
crowded about the soldiers, embrac
ing them and presenting them with
flowers.
The Americans also received a
warm welcome from the residents of
Vier'on. northeast of Monmedy, the
largest city in Belgium they have re
occupied. Scenes of enthusiasm have
7 : ft-. .A; i . , .v, V T. - -X- -, i.-.
greeted the troops from overseas in
every village through which they
have passed.
Just prior to the German evacuation
the mayor of'Vierton, in a proclama
tion, called on tlie citizens not to do
anything to provoke disorder during
the withdrawal of the enemy.
HUN WITHDRAWS RAPIDLY.
WITH THE AMERICAN ARMY OF
OCCUPATION. Nov. 18. (Ey the
Associated Press.) The Germans are
withdrawing as rapidly as possible.
In the towns now occupied by the
Americans, great stores, including
machine guns, cannon and ammuni
tion, have been found. At T llan
court there is a big airdorae, but most
of the planes left were damaged,
some apparently Intentionally so.
The hood of one machine had 'been
pierced by a dozen pistor shots, prob
ably in an endeavor to injure the
engine.
Business at Vierton, northeast of
Montmedy, was proceeding steadily an
hour after the Americans entered and
restaurants afforded a great surprise
by serving food to the hungry "deliv
erers." Meat was scarce, but there
was some, and sugar was plentiful.
Coffee and tobacco were brought
forth in abundance.
After the departure of the Germans
the mayor of Vierton called a con
ference of the mayors of the neigh
boring villages for the purpose of
outlining a plan of proceed tire under
the new military supervision. The
townspeople opened soup kitchens for
the repatriated prisoners who con
tinued to" stream back throughout the
day and the wounded prisoners in
hospitals were cared for by a local
committee.
- Jt was America's day in Belgium.
The residents had decorated their
shops and homes with thousands of
flags of the allies, almost all of which
seemed to have been made from
scraps of silkrand other material
which lay hidden for months awaiting
the great day. The civilian guards
also appeared in brand new uniforms,
which they had been saving.

Great Reception Certain
Mr. Wilson is expected to receive
abroad a reception such as has been
accorded but few men in public life.
He will be welcomed not only as the
president of the United States and
the commander in chief of its armies
and navy, but also as the champion of
world democracy.
In visiting Europe the president will
establish two precedents. He will be
the first chief executive of the United
States to participate in a peace con
ference for the settling ot issues grow
ing out of a war in which this country
participated and likewise he will be
the first president to leave North
America during his term of office.
In reaching his decision to attend
the peace conference President Wil
son is understood to have been influ
enced largely by representations from
Premiers Lloyd George of Great Bri
tain and Clemenceau ot France anj
other statesmen of the entente coun
tries. The principles and terms of set
ment enunciated by the president have
been accepted by bota Uie associated
nations and the central powers as the
basis upon which peace is to be re
established and it is understood that
it is for the working out of the appli
cation of these principles that his
presence is so earnestly desired by
the allied statesmen.
Weeks in Advance
Since the president is to sail for
France early next month, it seems cer
tain that he will reach Paris several
weeks before the peace congress as
sembles. His purpose is believed here
to be to participate in the conference
now proceeding at Versailles as the
preliminary to the meeting of the
peace commisisoners. He thus will
have opportunity to discharge in per
son for the first time the duties of his
membership In the sapreme war coun
cil, which bring together the entente
premiers with the representatives of j
lilt; vui'tu claim nit; ui die 4111 im
portance for in all probability it will j
be at these sessions that the general i
program which is to govern the peace j
congress will be arranged.
At Opening Session
The president will attend the open-.
ing sessions of the congress at w hich '
the broad principles of the treaty will i
be settled, but he will not remaini for I
the subsequent detailed discussions J
and settlements of the various ques- :
tioiid. This will be the work of the j
ALLIES TRIUMPHED
f j
j
commissioners he soon is to nam. to
represent the United Mates.
By carrying out this unusual pro
gram of having the conference draft
and adopt a general peare treaty at
the outset, the presiut nt and the en
tente premiers will be able soon after
the commission assembles to return
to their own counties and attend to
important business at home.
Who Will Act
Since the suggestion that the presi
dent attend the peae conference first
was made there has been much discus
sion here as to whether while absent
from the country he could continue to
act as president. The constitution it
self is silent on the question and gen
erally the question is regarded as on
which the president himself must de
cide. The prevailing opinion here is that
Mr. Wilson already has made up his
mind on this subject. He doe3 not go
to the peace conference as a delegate,
and, consequently, it is held that
should he relinquish his authority and
functions of office he would be with
out power to act for the United States
in the discussions.
Other Presidential Visits
There is ample precedent for the
president to leave the territorial limits
of the United States. President Har
rison 011 one occasion went into Can
ada, while President Taft visited both
that country and Mexico. President
Roosevelt and also President Taft vis
ited the Panama canal zone.
Both President Taft and President
Roosevelt continued to perform the
functions of their office while on tne
visits to the canal zone, sending in
structions to Washington both by
cable and wireless. It was pointed out
today that the president also could in
this manner attend to any pressing
matters of importance here while he
is abroad.
May Use Battleship
In all probability the president will
cross the Atlantic on an American
battleship, probably on one of the
navy's newest dreadnauhts. While on
such a trip, it is claimed, he is on
American territory and technically
would be absent from the country only
for such time as he actually is on for
eign soil.
If the president intends to delegate
any of the functions of his office to
Vice-President Marshall, the vice
president has not been so informed,
and tills fact in itself was accepted in
some quarters as clearly indicating
that the president has decided that
his physical absence from the country
does not create such a vacancy in the
office as to fall within the section ot
the constitution which clothes the
vice-president with authority to dis
charge the duties of the office during
the inability of the president to act.
Effect on Congress
Tha question of what effect the
president's absence will have on the
work of congress was freely discussed
tonight in congressional circles. Many
held that the president could not ap
prove or veto legislation while absent
as the actual signature of the presi
dent is required. Under the provisions
of the constitution if bills are not act
ed upon by the chief executive within
ten days after their passage they auto
matically become effective.
Very little important business will
be transacted by congress in Decern-

clared "it would stand firmly for the
spirit of patriotic industrial co-operation
for the working out of the re
construction post-war period, so that j
the United States will be m a posi

ne''d here and abroad."
"In America today we hold the
powerful influence of providing ex
amples for the rest of the world." re.id
the statement. "Confusions and in
equities which have developed iu our
American industries during the hustle
and bustle of waging war on a mod

eliminated in good time. We must
lend every effort to avoid bitterness,
acrimony, calamity howling or whin

either side, if there are sides, through
cultivation or promotion of misunder

has. or seeks, to acquire any rights or
privileges which any other good
American is asked to "surrender,- the
statement continued:
"We believe that absolutism on the
part of labor it just as bad for the
general welfare of the nation as
absolutism of so-called capital. Both
elements ought to be able to find a

UTILIZE BOARD
(Bv Review leased Wire)
WASHINGTON. Nov. 18. Conver
sion of the war industries board to a
peace industries board to act as a bal
ance wheel during the re-construction
period was suggested by representa
tives of more than 100 automobile
manufacturers at a meeting here to
day of the National Automobile cham
ber of commerce. Committees were
appointed to co-operate with the war
unanimously not to hold the annual
after-the-war problems.
The manufacturers voted almost
unanimously not to hold the annoul
national automobile shows in New
York and Chicago this winter . While
restrictions on exhibits of a commer
cial nature have been removed by the
government, the automobile men ex
pressed a belief that it would not be
possible to prepare suitable exhibits
in the time available.
Statistics presented to the meeting
by the manufacturers showed that the
output of passenger cars for the yearj
1918 will be less than one million, i
wjiereas. on the basis of 1917. produc
tion without the restrictions placed
upon plants, the production for the
year would have reached approxi
mately two million.
ber under the program as now out
lined. No pressing legislative matters
now pending or in prospect are like
ly to lie completed before the expect
ed adjournment of congress for over
the Christmas holidays, and if con
gress does adjourn it will not re
assemble until early in January and
the president probably will return
home soon afterwards.
There was no statement tonight as
to whether the American delegates to
the peace conference actually will ac
company the president or will follow
at a later date. In some quarters it
was regarded as likely that they
would make the trip with the presi
dent so as to have the advantage of
conferences with representatives of
the allied nations before the peace
congress convenes. ,
Lansing at Head
Secretary Lansing undoubtedly will
head the American commissioners.
Others regarded as probable selec
tions as delegates are Colonel House,
Louis D. Brandeis. associnte justice
of the supreme court, and Elihu Root,
former secretary of state.
Gen. Tasker If. Bliss, former chief
of staff and military representative
of the United States on the supreme
war council. Is expected to head the
military representatives from this
country who will assist in the wcrk
of the pace conference while Vlep.
Admiral Sims probably will he select
ed to head the naval delegation.
Beside the delegates and militanr
and naval representstives there will
be a secretary to the delegation and a
number of assistant secretaries and
clerks.

rear. Avertt was the machine gunner I
of his tank while his "buddy" ran the
engine and steered the tank.
"I was so near a number of Ger-j
mans encountered in a shallow trench
that I could see the terror on their
faces when my gun began to let flv
bullets almost In their very faces,"
Sergeant Avertt said. "These were
the first boches I ran Into on this
drive and I certainly let them have It
as fast as my old machine could fire,
and that was some fast, and 1 just
kept going ahead and pounding away
until every last one of them was
stretched out on the ground.
"Passing beyond this hastily dug
trench, I, in the meantime watching
my 'brothers' on my right and left
and at the same time keeping tab
on the doughboys coming up, I got
sight of a little batch of Germans
behind a hump in the hill along the
roadway, or what had been a road
way before our heavy artillery opened
up that morning. These were ma
chine gunners. I soon learned, and
bullets began to splash off Uie tank's
sides, particularly those who struck
a glancing blow.
"I ordered my tank 'buddy' at the
wheel to keep after those gunners if
and we went up after them sort of
it cost us all fou wheels. He did,
sideways, and 1 got around onto the
side of that hump, and my 'brother"
on the other side was doing the same
and we wiped that bunch out in' a
jiffy I believe it .was by enfilading
fire, as the officers call it."
Sergeant Averett explained that the
tank men, all of whom were Ameri
cans using two-men tanks invented by
the French, always watched each
other closely, or endeavored to, the
idea being to keep a hundred yards
or so apart for their mutual protec
tion, and It being important also that
they not get too far ahead of the
infantry.
"Just beyond the hump was a clump
of woods, and we bej;an to pour bul
lets into that,"- Sgt. Avertt continued,
"and for a time there was some smoke
arising above the tree tops so we
knew there were boches in there.
About four of us opened up in full
force and showered that woods with
lead.
"The machine gun answers were
pretty stiff for awhile, as we went
forward, but I just kept peppering
away and talking to my 'buddy' all
the time and telling him what we
were going to do clean out that
woods. My 'brothers' on either side
some way had the same hunch. The
doughboys back of me too were firing
rlcrht n Inn it nith if and the boche in
that Uiicket must heave thought all J
hell had broken loose, because first
thing I knew the firing virtually
stopped and I figured all the boches
had been killed or had decided to
beat it before we all got there in
force.
"Along about this time I noticed
that the tank boys on the right were
swinging around the side of a clump i
of trees and from the position f j
thuir guns and the speed of their
tanVs I Judged that they were giving
fits to some Fritzes running away. I
then switched so as to run alongside
the thicket, at a distance, and joined
the tank boys going around the end.
"Just about that time there w.as a
voilcy of machine gun bullets, and
some anti-tank gun stuff, too. from a
hill a bit to my left; suddenly . my
talk just began to tremble or some
thing, and then stooped, and shud
dered all over. I looked down and
my 'buddy' was limp in his seat. Oae
of those ia-nncd bullets lad come In
through my 'buddy's' peep hole and
hit bim square In the face.
"My 'buddy' was dead. His final
clutch on the throttle shut off the
gas and the old tank stopped, and
there I was, and the other boys went
on. That's about all I know about
that fight, or whatever it was, and
I'm waiting around now for another
tank and another 'buddy' to take me
up front again where things are do
ing every minute. This tank busi
ness is great business for the boys
who like to shoot."
Avertt said that when he w ent into ;
action he deterimned to keep count of!
the number of Germans his mach'ite;
gun "touched off." but when he be
gan to use his gun lie could think ot :
nothing but a purpose to spread
death add destruction and that he j
quickly lost count of the number ho j
saw fall.

The crime of which he is now held,
was a deliberate cold blooded murder
as will be seen from the following
story taken from the Phoenix Gazette:
Notwithstanding carefully laid plans
for the murder of Charles H. Lyshon
of Las Vegas, Nev., arid for the dispo
sition of the body after the murder,
Willis Woods, alias Bill Taylor, failed
to cover his only possible tracks of
the tragedy. . As a result Woods is in
the Maricopa county jail facing a first
degree murder charge for one of the
most atrocious killings recorded since
Kenneth C. Falston was slain.
Woods made the mistake that others
of his kind frequently do in endeavor
ing to "cover' 'after their crimes he
did not take into consideration the in
nermost workings of a youngster's
heart. And because he believed that he
had seduced the only witness to the
crime to life long silence. Woods faces
paying the penalty for his act in the
Arizona state prison at Florence.
Shot Without Warning
The murder of Lychon was commit
ted on the Black canyon road, about 20
miles north of Phoenix, early on the
morning of Tuesday, November 5.
Woods, alias Taylor, was in the rear
seat of ther automobile, which was the
property of Lychon, when a fit of an
ger seized him, he told officers in an
alleged written confession. Lychon
was riding in the front seat of the ma
chine at the time.
Without warning he drek his 45 cali
bre Colt's revolver from his pocket
and, pressing the muzzle to the back
of Lychon's head, fired a shot into the
latter's brain. Death resulted almost
instantly, it is believed.
Leonard Thompson, a 15-year-old
boy of good appearance, was the third
member of the party and witnessed
the shooting. Coerced by Woods, the
boy "aided in the burial of Lychon's
body in a shallow grave dug by Woods
about 300 yard3 south of the old well
iu the community.
Come to Phoenix
Then Woods and Thompson proceed
ed to Phoenix, but instead of stopping
here went on to Tempe, where they
registered at the Casa Loma hotel
The next day Woods sold the 1915
model ludson touring car to a Tempe
gardge, the consideration being $100.
Then they boarded a train and pro
ceeded back to Las Vegas, Nev. Dur
ing this time Woods used Lychon's
name.
During all of this time, Thompson
told officers here today, his lips had
been sealed by Woods on threat of
the death penalty. Woods repeatedly
told him he said, that if he made any
attempt to tell what had transpired on
the desert he would kill him. Through-
Out all of these days Woods would
never permit the boy out of his sight
nor would he allow the youngster to
converse with anyone.
Liquor Hi Downfall
But when the pair arrived in Las
Vegas Woods' craving for liquor got
the best of him and soon he was in
toxicated. Consequently the boy
roamed the streets at will. His pecu
liar manner aroused the suspicions oi
officers and he was ultimately arrest
ed. Then he gave up the story of the
terrible murder, the crime that had
been weighting do A n his soul and had
made his life during the few interven
ing davs a horrible nightmare.
On the strength of his story Woods
was later arrested and told that the
boy had escaped. Woods imemdiately
laid the crime at the door of the
youngster.
Search Streets Here
Officers of Las Vegas ttyen commun
icated with Sheriff W. H. Wilky. Aft
er a i.aritlal confession was secured by
Las Vegas officers they wired Sheriff
Wilky as to the description of the
ground where the body had been
buried. A search of the vicinity was
without results, however, and the
searching party returned to Phoenix.
Las Vegas officers were then wired

Because of the description of the '

however, the officers were convinced
j that the person giving the information

Woods and the youngster be brought

admitted having been in trouule on
previous occasions. He was convicted
of cattle rustling in Cochise county
about six or seven years ago, he said,
and was sentenced to the siate prison,
later being paroled.
Some time previous to that he had
been convicted on a similar thar.-e,
but secured a new trial, and was treed
of the charpe at the second trial.
During his travels with the hoy he
confessed to the hoy that he had killej
several- men. Among his victims, he
said, were six Mexicans and one In
dian. Woods seems to present a bra
vado appearance. He is a man si
years old, his alleged confession
status. Lyshon, the man he murdered,
was of the same age, he says.
"Woods alleges ti:at the shot was
fired following a quarrel, but young
Thompson denies this. A few words
had passed between the men. Thomp
son said, but Woods had been the ag
gressor throughout.
Still Had Revolver
The revolver with which the shoot
ing was done was found on Wood's
person when arrested at Las Vegas. It
is now being held by Sheriff Wilky at
the sheriff's office. It is a pearl-handled
gun and an expensive one.
Woods was taken into lustice court
yesterday morning, but waived prelim
inary examination. Bonds were fixed
in the sum of $ !0.000, which he was
unable to furnish. The warrant charg
ing him with first degree murder was
signed by Sheriff Wilky.
"Woods will be taken before Judge
R. C. Stanford in division one of the
superior court late this afternoon and
given an opportunity to enter his plea.
It is believed that he will enter a plea
of guilty and the life sentence imposed
immediately thereafter.

eral miles north of Tyrone, camping
for the night and arising very early in
the morning, they proceeded to walk
many miles without breakfast, the
general setting a smart pate, which
never slackened. A number of deer
were sighted but at too great distance
to bring down. At last a 175 pound
buck loomed up 400 yards away, when
a well aimed shot from the general's
"trusty" was sent straight through the
animal's heart. It was the only deer
brought in" by the party. General
Lindsay has long been considered a
crack shot in the army. Mr. Bvans, of

PHYSICALLY FIT
AT ANY AGE
. It isn't age, it's careless living that
puts men "down and out." Keep your
internal organs in good condition and
you will always be physically fit.
Watch the kidneys.
The kidneys are the most overwork
ed organs in the human body. When
they break down under the strain and
the deadly uric acid accumulates and
crystalizes look out! These sharp
crystals tear and scratch the delicate
urinary channels causing excruciating
pain and set up irritations which may
cause premature degeneration and
often do turn into deadly Blight's di
sease. One of tho first warnings of slug
gish kidney action is pain or stiffness
in the small of the back, high colored
or scanty urine, loss of appetite, indi
gestion or rheumatism.
Do not wait until the danger is upon
you. At the first indication of trou
ble go after the cause at once. Go to
your druggist immediately. Get a trial

In buying our stock you invest in a proven oil property.
LISTEN: In drilling our hole we encountered true oil
bearing sand, carrying rich parafine petroleum, the
highest grade and most valuable and therefore, the
most marketable of oils, bringing the highest price of
all crude oils.
We may confidently expect, now that peace is assured,
a steadily advancing market in petroleum, this has been
predicted by the WALL STREET JOURNAL of last
week's issue.
In further drilling fcnd upon reaching the source of these
