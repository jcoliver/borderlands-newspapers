UNDATED WAR LEAR. BY
THE ASSOCIATED PRESS.
There hasvbeen no abatement in
the strength-of the offensive the
British, French and American
troops are throwing against the
German armies from Arras to the
region of Soissons. And as yet
there is no indication that it is the
purpose of the seemingly demoral
ized enemy to turn about and face
their aggressors or to offer more
resistance for the present than
throough the activities of strong
rear guards.
Not alone have the allied troops
all over the battle front from Ar
ras to Soissons gained further im
portant terrain, but to the north
the British have advanced their
line in the Lys sector, apparently
without much effort.
Of greater significance than
any of the other victories achieved
, In Friday's fighting is the gain of
; the French, with which Americans
are being added in this general
sector north of Soissons. The
latest French official records the
capture of Chavigny, three miles
northwest, and Cuffies, a mile and
a half north of Soissons, and the
entry into the outskirts of Crouy,
to the northeast.
These victories, gained only aft
er the hardest kind of fighting
make more secure the allied line
running northward and out-flanking
the Aisne and the Chemin Des
Dames positions. Also battering
this general situation has been the
crossing by the French of the Ail
lette river at Champs.
In the region north of Noyon the
French have made further progress,
crossing the canal Du Xord at several
places and advancing materially in the
direction of the Noyon-Ham railroad
line. AH around Noyon the French
have strengthened their positions.
All the territory on the north and
west banks of the Somme where the
British have been operating against
the Germans now has been cleared of
the enemy, and south of Peronne on
the east bank of the stream, notwith
standing the destruction of the bridges
by the Germans.

En route to Csquimalt, B. C, and
thence to New York via Ottawa,
Vilhjalmur Stefansson, arctic ex
plorer, outfitted himself with
"store clothes" here today, his
first opportunity in five years.
He arrived yesterday wearing
mocassins and other rough gar

will visit his mother at Wynward,
near Saskatoon.
Stefansson declared he is anxi
ous to help the allied cause and be
lieves he can do this best by giv
ing lectures In the United States
for the Red Cross. He expects it
will be many months before he re
gains his former physical endur

explorations. After his illness
from pneumonia and pleurisy at
Herechel last January, he traveled
four weeks with dogs, over snow
covered mountains, to Porcupine
river and thence to Ft. Yukon,
where he took treatment for 150
days.

WITH THE BRITISH ARMY IN
FRANCE, Aug. 30. (By the Associ
ated Press, 4 p. m.) It is reported
that Bailleul on the northern side of
the Lye salient has been evacuated
by the Germans and that the British
are either entering the town or may
soon occupy It. Longotte and Ecoust
St. Mein, southwest of Bullecourt, are
reported to have been captured today
by the British. All the country sout:i
and west of the river is now free of
the enemy. t
The fighting British' -armies agaiu
smashed their way forward today all
along the line. There has been very
heavy fighting almost everywhere be
tween the Somme and Scarpe rivers.
and under the force of repeated blows,
delivered with machine-like precision,
the foe has been forced to abandon
many more town positions and large
strips of ground.
Once more the Germans have suf
fered terrible losses. The British
have freed all the country south and
west of the Somme. the last Germans
being driven behind the river this
morning. Even there the enemy is
not finding rest, for the British have
crossed the stream at least at one
place south of La Chapellette.
From Peronne southward first the
British cannon and then the French
auns are hurling projectiles, big and
little, on the other side of the river.
Just north of the Somme after it turns
wes the British have captured Clery
and are pressing toward Peronne.
The Germans have been trying ever
since the fall of Bapaume to hold the
line running along the road between
that town and Peronne. British pa
trols have reached Le Transloy, direct
ly on the road, and it is reported that
Le Transloy has fallen and that a
fierce battle within a battle is raging
almost along the whole length of the
road, rtard fighting is going on around
Beaulencourt. which is astride the
road between Le Transloy and Ba
paume. The Germans hold the major
portion of this village for the moment,
but they seem destined to be thrown
out. A struggle is in progress at Mor
val. southwest of Le Transloy. The
fighting appears to have reached a
band-to-hand character, and the Ger
mans are said to have suffered front
British bayonets. Other towns in this
immediate neighborhood fell this
morning or during laRt night.
From this locality the line of battle
swings wide around Bapaume and
there has been more heavy fighting
here. Bancourt. east of Bapatfme, fell
after being stormed.
Astride the road to Cambrai from
Peronne, the British crashed into the
Germans and smothered their resist
ance, some times again at the point
of the bayonet. Freniicourt seems to
have been taken and the British have
driven on eastward. North of here
Vaulx-Fraucourt. which contained a
laree enemy garrison that offered the
strongest resistance with machine
euns. apparently has fallen in its en
tiretv to the British. Ecoust St. Meln
and Ixingatte. in its suburbs, are agsln
reported to have been captured by
the British.
Here the Germans delivered ft now

SYMPATHETIC EAR.

LONDON, Aug. 3 The press
bureau, in a statement issued at

if they return to work the govern
ment will give full and sympathetic
consideration to their representa
tions. POLICE STRIKE
SPREADS QUITE
Fully Half of London Bobbies
Out, According to Their
Claim, While Small Towns
May Be Affected
(By Review Leased Wire)
LONDON. Aug. 30 The police of
the Ixmdon Metropolitan district, em
bracing an area of 700 square miles
and a population of approximately 8,
000,000, went on strike today for more
pay. The. "city" comprised within an
area of little more than one square
mile, and which has its own police
force, is not yet affected.
The force numbers about 22,000..
Union leaders sav 10,000 of these were
"out" at noon and the greater propor
tion of the remainder had shown them
selves in sympathy with the strike.
A union leader said the pay of Ion
don policemen is 38 shillings weekly,
plus 12 shillings war bonus and the
possible addition of 2 shillings weekly
after twenty-one years' service. Ser
geants recetve 10 shillings more week
ly than patrolmen.
"The London police are about the
poorest paid in the world," said this
union leader. "For a year we tried all
the routine methods. It was only when
these failed we decided to strike."
There was a similar disturbance on
a smaller scsle in 1S72 and again in
1890, although both attempts were
suppressed in a day or two.
A high Scotland Yard official it
quoted by the Pall Mall Gazette, as
saying: "We take a very serious view
of the men's action. They are not
striking. They are mutinying in the
face of the enemy. The police are a
disciplined force which has been ex
empted from the military service to
nrotect property. It is a ouasi-military
force and in mutinying the men are
breaking one of our lines of defense
and compelling us to gather together
a scratch force."
At headquarters of the police union
tonieht it was said the strike was ex
tending and that it virtually affected
the entire Metropolitan police. It was
lidded there waa every probability that
the strike would be extended to pro
vincial towns.

The position was taken, the let
ter to Mr. Baker concluded, be
cause the company was convinced
that the war labor board would
cause demoralization and dissatis
faction among "loyal employes,"
lack of respect for the manage

WASHINGTON. Aug. 30. Con
gress failed again today to com
plete the manpower bill. Only the
formality of the signing of the
measure by the presiding off icers
cf the senate and house remains
and it was predicted tonight the
measure would be in President
Wilson's hand soon after the con
vening hour. Its Immediate ap
proval by the executive commit
tee is expected.
The ronfenfhee report of the
bill, approved, yesterday by the
house, was adopteJ late today by
the senate by a yea and nay vote
with but feeble opposition of few
senators present. Senate debate
on the work or fight amendment's
excision was so protracted that the
house adjourned before the bill
could be returned there for the
signature of the speaker. The
rules rrquire that signatures of
the presiding officers be attached
to the engrossed measure while
the houses are in session.
Senate debate today centered on
the elimination of the "work or
fight" amendment by the con
ferees. .Senators Thomas of Colo
rado, author of. the amendment,
and McCtimber of North Dakota,
protested. Chairman Chamberlain
of the senate coherence commit
tee defended the action of the com
mittee in yielding to house oppo
sition. While not objecting to
give boys under 21 years of age
the saiu,. homestead rights as
those above that age. Senator
Jones of New Mexico, former as
sistant secretary of the interior,
protested against the provision,
saying it would not have the effect
desired by its suppor'crs, and
would result in much public land
being kept tied up.
Senators Walsh and Nelson
urged that the New Mexico sen
ator not press his opposition at
this time, declaring that passage
of the supplementary resolution
any time within the next six
months would meet the situation,
while prompt disposal of the pend
ing bill was imperative.

WASHINGTON. Aug. 30 Opposi

ed as wasteful and unnecessary, to
gether with protracted debate on the
conference report to the manpower
bill, resulted in the failure of the sen
ate to nass the agricultural appropria
tion hill, with its amendment provid
ing for prohibition aftr June 30, 1919.
Prohibition leaders plan for a vote to
morrow. Discussion of minor appropriations
occupied most of the time, senators
contending much of the money could
be devoted to better purposes. An
amendment authorizing the secretary
i of agriculture to set aside $2.r00,00

soli! to farmers was adopted.
The bill with the prohibition amend

First Meeting Results in Out
line of Principles and List of
Business First Called On
The Cochise county labor board, at
a most important meeting, held yes
terday in Douglas, decided upon the
non-essential industries for this coun
ty in making its most urgent call for
unskilled labor for war work- Cochise
is expected to furnish over 500 un
skilled laborers at once for war indus
tries. Every idle man in the county
and every man engaged in a non-essential
industry as listed by the board
is expected to enroll with one of the
board's agents at one of the many en
roiling places in the county at once.
The following are the non-essentials
as listed by the board.
Automobiles, other than licensed
stage lines, and also oilera, washers,
salesmen and lesser help around ga
rages. Drivers of jitneys ancUfor hire cars.
Bath and barber shop attendants.
Brokers.
Bowling alleys, billiard and 'poor
halls - - - ' . .r. - :
Bottling works, candy manufactur
ers and cigar and tobacco stands.
('leaning and dyeing works.
Dancing academies.
Restaurant ml hotel employes.
Fruit r.d flower stands.
Junk dealers, delivery and sale sta
bles. Pawnbrokers, peanut and popcorn
stands, shoe shining shops and window
cleaners, soft drink establishments.
As regards mercantile establishr
ments, while these are classed as non
essential by the national government,
the local board did not so class them
at this time. Of course no men are
wanted from the mines or from railroad
service, as that would only be robbing
Peter to pay Paul. It Is strongly urged
hv the board that all employers of
labor use the U. S. employment serv
ice whenever possible. It is also urged
upon all employers to ifce female help
in every way and in every place pos
sible.
while the decrees and regulations of
this board are not mandatory by law
at this time, it is expected they soon
will be unless the patriotism of the
citizens heeds this most urgent call.

to block war measures.
"In times of peace ycu have a legal
right to oppose, by free speech, prep
arations for war. But when war has
been declared that r.'sht ceases forth

Aside from a slight disturbance in
the corridor when one of the prisoners
became hysterical while being led
away, there was no disorder. Scores
of special police barked the corridors
and court room. Only relatives of the
defendants were admitted.
There was a deep silence as Hay
wood and his fourteen chief assistants
were called before the bar. As "Bis
Bill" arose from h's seat a group of
women who had been weeping started
a mild ovation, wh.ch was quickly s.'
lenced. George Ar.dreytchiue, the
young Belgian poet, who has had a
stormy career, was next called. He
smiled and blew a kiss to his briilo
and she waved her handkerchief.

room, whose doors and windows had
been closed and locked, with sharp,
direct sentences, reviewed the nation

removed it when called for sentence

GRAIN MARKET.
CHICAGO, Aug. 30. Corn today
found a new level, but recovered and
closed 1 to 1V4 over yesterday. The
dip was due to the fact that victories
in Europe are regarded as bearish, and
to the big discount of the No. 5 grades
in the sample market, which declineJ
5 to 10, and were 7 under the August
and September deliveries. The clos
ing rally was due to profit taking by
shorts. Cash hfluses generally were
on the selling side. October closed 14
tfp at $1.56. Fluctuations ranged
2, and the movements were nervous
and jerky.
In the oats pit the same nervous ten
sion was observed, but sentiment was
more evenly divided than In corn.
Cash houses and those with country
connections continued hedging. Some
of the buying was reported as being
for shippers. Cash oats were slightly
lower, with No. 3 white about 2'4 and
standard about Hi under October. Re
ceipts continued liberal.
The provisions market In a sluggish
way was firm, in sympathy with corn
and hogs, except that ribs worked 5
cents lower. .Pork closed 12 to 20
cents and lard 5 cents higher.
COTTON MARKET.
NEW YORK, Aug. 30. Cotton
closed steady at a net loss of 50 to
62 points October closed at 34.50.
METAL MARKET.
New York, Aug. 30. Lead easy;
spot. 8.05; spelter easy; ?pot. Iast
St. Louis delivery, 9.00 to 9.12.

A NERVOUS WRECK
From Three Tear' Suffering. Say
Cardoi Made Her Well.
Texas City, Tex. In an Interesting
statement, Airs. O. H. Schill, of this town,
ays: "For three years I suffered untold
agony with my head. I was unable to
do any of my work.
I Just wanted to sleep all the time, for
that was the only ease I could get, when
I was asleep. I became a nervous wreck
just from the awful suffering with my ,
head. I
I was so nervous that the least noise 1
would make me jump out of my bed. I
had no energy, and was unable to do
anything. My son, a young boy, had to 1
do all my household duties.
I was not able to do anything until I ;
took CarduL I took three bottles in all
and it surely cured me of those awful I
headaches. That has been three years
ago, and I know the cure is permanent, '
for I have never had any 'headache since
taking Cardul. . . '
Nothing relieved me until I took Cardui.
It did wonders for me."
Try Cardui for your troubles made
from medicinal ingredients recommended
In medical books as being of benefit in
lemale troubles, and 40 years of use has
proven that the books are right. Begin
taking Cardui today. NC-134 1

AT ALL PUBLIC DINNERS
A Topeka. Kansas, man wrote the following prac
tical, pointed, piercing verses and read them at a com
mercial club dinner:
Over in France, where the death shells scream,
The boys are fighting as in a dream
A glorious dream of blood and hell
While I stay home and prosper well.
Over in France, they are dying now.
Like red earth turned by a giant plow;
They are going across, with a smile, for me,
While I stay Jiome in security.
Over in France, the gas clouds roll.
And the shower of steel is taking its toll;
The Flag drives on, but the boys lie still.
While I live on and eat my fill.
Dear God in heaven, in whom we trust.
Turn the food :i my throat to dust y
If I miss one chance which may come to me
To bring them home with the victory.
Germany Must Pay for
Lusitania at Peace Table
The Federal District Court of New York,
in a decision written by Judge Julius M.
Mayer and filed the other day, holds that
the Cunarder Lusitania, torpedoed by a
German submarine on the afternoon of
May 7, 19I5, was an unarmed merchant
vessel which had no explosives of any kind
on board. The court further decides that
when the German! government, acting
through its submarine commander, de
stroyed the great ship, it committed "an in
expressibly cowardly attack," which wa3 a
violation of all laws governing civilized
warfare at sea. The contention of the BriN
ish owners of the Lusitania that the act was
that of a pirate and common enemy of man- '
kind is upheld by Judge Mayer. This is
the first time that an American court has
had an opportunity to pass directly upon
the various contentions put forward in re
gard to the sinking.
Refusing to hold the Cunard Line liable
for damages due to loss of life and prop
erty, as a result of the act of the German
government, Judge Mayer expressed his
sympathy for survivors and relatives cf
those who were lost, and suggests that the
place to get the damages undoubtedly due
them is not from the treasury of the Cun
ard line, but from that of thelmperial Ger
man government, a payment which should
be exacted at the peace table by the United
States and Great Britain.
SPENT MILLIONS IN FLOTS
That the German government spent be
tween fifteen and twenty million dollars on
plots and intrigues in this country in 1915
and 1 91 6 through a single channel, the of
fice of Dr. Heinrich F. Albert, commercial
attache of the German embassy, is reveal
ed for the first time in the latest publica
tion of the committe on public information,
made public at Washington today.
The story told by the official records as
they are painstakingly explained and in
terpreted is an amazing one of official Ger
man unscrupulousness, effrontery and ly
ing. The means employed included:
Lai,)r leaii rs corrupted, and strikes caused in
muiiiMoHs plants, by German influence.
G-.-rnisn financing of the movement for an em
bargo on munitions shipments.
lJitni"iion oi innocent men hunt v-s.icis by
bombs plai.v d in their cargoes by German agents
in American harbors.
Pir.ts fur tiie promotion of sabotage in the
United States ami in Cana'la. including the blowing
up 't the W'eiland Canal and the Canadian I'a
ciiic Uailv.ay.
Corrupt of Amei i' an opinion through the
agency o: German paitl professors, newspapers and
lecturers.
Forcing U pa.-.-porta to send German reserv
ists abroad.
Supply irom Americ an ports of German raid
eis at sea.
German plots nrgani.i d here in order to cau.e
rcvoit in India and in Ireland.
Proeiiratn.ii of perjury and the shaiucli ss ly
inr of Co Gt rm.in government.
Perhaps history contains no instance of
effrontery greater than tlx- issuance of the
American press in December, 1915, of the
lollowing of fit ial lie:
"I he German government his naturally
necr knowingly accepted the supvtt of
any person, group of persons, society or or
ganization seeking to promote the cause of
Germany in the United States by illegal
acts, by counsel of violence, by contraven
tion of law, or by any means whatever that
could offend the American people in the
pride of their own authority."
Every line of this pamphlet proves the
falsity of this official German statement.
In the cantonment at Camip Devens, Mas
sachusetts, it has been found that the sol
diers in training there to fight for Uncle
Sam speak forty different languages. What
is the common bond that binds them to
gether in this nation's cause? Liberty and
love and all the bright, fair ideas that follow
in the train of the equality of men. What is
the common language by which they make
themselves known to each other? Ameri
can slang and by-words and pass-words of
the alley, street, boulevard, hedge and
country lane. In the long run an army will
be just as great as its cause, its home, its
school house and ground, its courts and cus
toms and councils before it went to war.
.This American army of forty tongues will
have only one tongue when it comes back
from the war, and that will be the English
tongue as she is spoken in the U. S. A.
The Tuscon Citizen, under the not unap
prcipriate heading of "Killing Off the
Press," declares that if the government
drafted a lot of those publicity agents who
are trying to pirate space in the press for
about every wise and foolish thing going
in connection with the war, it would have
done well, and adds that the patriotism of
the press is still undimmed and undimin
ished in spite of the fact that the govern
ment has ordered all concerns it has taken
over to cease advertising and has also
greatly increased the postage upon all pe
riodicals. The Citizen seems to think
that the press can survive every blow di
rected at it from Washington in the shape
of loss of business and increase of ex
penses except that o;e awful stroke of the
deadly iunk sent out by the army of pub
licity agents.
"Why is sugar still scarce?" asked the
average citizen who notes with satisfaction
the let up of the wheat and meat situations.
Simply because we cannot spare the ships
for the long voyage to the East Indies to
get this sugar. And neither can Engla td
or France spare the ships. Every bottom is
being used to carry troops and munitions
and supplies to the allied battle lines. We
are getting our sugar from the West Indie?
and keeping most of it ourselves, sending
only a small part to our allies. But we &n
rest assured that for every restriction and
every sacrifice we are giving some small
portion to an English or French family and
assuring a full portion to our, soldiers and
those of our allies. Our two pounds a
month allotment to each person would look
like a candy factory to a French household.
They have beaten that woman, Jean
ette Rankin, in Montana, for renomina
tion to congress. More power to them.
She was against the war and she was also
"wobbly" in her utterances and impulses.
Take her all in all, this, the first woman con
gressman, did the cause of woman suffrage
more harm than all other causes, oppo
nents, influences and facts and arguments
put together. She was a dismal failure in
public life. But it does not necessarily fol
low that all women are of her type. There
are plenty of women in America who would
make excellent congressional material. But,
even this being true, it is no particular argu
ment for equal suffrage.
Society item in the Berlin Tageblatt:
"During the recent visit of Messrs. Foch,
Haig, Byng and Rawlinson, at headquarters
of the Bavarian crown prince on the north
ern section of the western battle front, his
highness, Rupprecht, was absent in Munich
on a visit with his sweetheart. The prince
is not likely to return soon, and as a result
there is much unfavorable comment in
German circles for this impolite treatment
of distinguished guests from other countries."
In order to balance the German mind,
which is sagging down at one end on ac
count of many defeats on the ; western
front, the German staff is spreading broad
cast the report that the submarines have
already sunk forty American transports
loaded with troops. Doesn't the German
staff EVER expect to le called to account
for the final trial balance of all its juggling
of figures in the war book of the nation ?

HCOFES SOUNDS
SLOGAN AT BIG
WAR LOAN MEET
fContinued Irom Pape One)
and Louisiana at. Shreveport last
night.
The meeting was held at the Vouree
hotel and aroused the greatest enthu
siasm. Mr. Hoopes spoke in part as fol
lows: "This is a loan of sacrifice. We
must get down to the same basis as
have the French and the English peo
ple. To fight this war with our spare
cash is an impossibility. We must
devote to it our luxuries, our comforts,
our very necessities. We must lend,
if necessary, until it breaks. We must
lend, if necessary, until we have to j
go w ithout bread. American pride dic
tates that we should know no other
csurse. We should not allow our
European allies to beat us In bravery,
sacrifice or in effort. Despite bad
conditions in some parts of the terri
tory we must, as the English people
say, 'carry on.' We must get spirit
which makes men turn from casualty
lists or demands for half of their in
come with a chastened smile. Though
the lips tremble we must repeat to one !
another, 'carry on.' I
"We must lend as our boys have I
given, they're giving up income, loved j
ones, home, even life itself, and we
must be worthy of them.
"Your message to the wealthy man
must be a firm one. Extremely heavy
responsibilities rest upon the man
who, while he may be suffering
through bad business, has made mon
ey in the past. He must lay down
and dig down deep into his bank ac
count, and lift the burden that his
poorer neighbor cannot bear in tins
profound crisis in the test of citizen
ship." The speaker outlined many details
of organization to the assembled coun
ty representatives of the loan move
ment, and called for an organization
which should be the most closely
knit, the most thoroughly co-operative
and effective, that has ever existed in
Liberty loan work.
Wednesday night at a dance hall
at Eighth and G avenue Provost Leon
M. DeGryse saw two soldiers standing
in the hall near the doorway, one of
whom had a bottle of liquor in his
possession, the other some currency ip
his hands. The soldiers were standing
with their backs to the door, and De
Gryse started in their direction. When
he did so the soldiers with the liquor
made a dash for the second story win
dow and leaped through. Calling an
other provost to pursue the other sol
dier, DeGryse jumped through the win
dow and started after the fleeing sol
dier who had the liquor. He pursued
him to Eighth and D and there lost
track of him. The other soldier also
escaped.

afternoon to meet Rab B. Krebs of

out their registrations. The various
companies in the district have notified
their employes that they must comply
with the registration law or lose their
jobs. A number of young men had
given their age as 21 in order to secure
a job and had not registered. These
were required to secure birth certifi

H. T. Cobb and R:lph Elliott, who
were in the employ of the C. & A.
Mining company at the Junction shaft,
yesterday afternoon about 4 o'clock
accidentally picked into a piece of
powder when they were cleaning out
a stope. They were engaged In pick
ing up some of the dirt in order to
load it into the shoot when one of
them picked into a piece of powder
that had not exploded when the round
of hole3 had been set off. Cobb was
directly over the charge and received
the full force of the explosion on his
face and breast. The sight of his left
eye was destroyed and his right eye
badly injured by the particles of small
rock that were blown into it. His
face was also cut, as was his breast,
but the wounds are not serious.
Elliott, who was at one side, has
one of his arms cut by the flying rocks
and his eyes cut. by small rocks, but
not seriously.
Both men were taken at once to the
C. & A. hospital, where their wounds
were dressed by the company physi

that he hoped to be able to save
Cobb's right eye, but that the eye was
very badly bruised by the small rocks.

(By Review leased Wire)
NOGALES, Ariz., Aug. 30. A rifle
shot was fired on the Mexican side of
the border in Nogales, Sonora, late to
night, causing the sentry along the
American side of the international line
to take to cover. Investigation reveal
ed that the shot had not been fired
across the border and was probably
caused by the accidenetal discharge of
a rifle in the hands of an inexpe
rienced Mexican soldier. No further
shots were fired.
An additional infantry regiment ar
rived here today from San Francisco
and went into camp at Camp Steven
Little in the Tucson-Nogales turnpike.
The troops were en route to Nogales
when the shooting occurred Tuesday
and their arrival had no connection
with the shooting of Tuesday after
noon or the sniping of Wednesday
night.
Their presence here resulted in the
dissipation of whatever fears the more
timid residents of Nogales had and it
is now agreed that all danger of an
other clash is passed and the border
incident of Tuesday is closed.
An aftermath of the Tuesday shoot
ing affair was witnessed today when
the military funerals of Capt. Joseph
D. Hungerford and Lieut. Luke W.
Loftus were held here. The bodies
of the two officers who were victims
of Tuesday's affair were accompanied
to the station by a military escort of
negro and white troops while a mili
tary band played the "Dead March"
from Saul, and hundreds of soldiers
stood at attention while the women of
Nogales covered the caskets of the
dead officers with clusters of flowers
gathered from their yards.
The body of Captain Hungerford
was returned to Washington for burial
in the Arlington National cemetery.
That of Lieutenant Loftus, who died
from wounds received in Tuesday's en
gagement, was sent to Dolores, Texas,
for burial.
Quiet prevailed tonight along Inter
national avenue the boundary line and
except for a number of bullet shatter
ed windows in the stone custom house
and the presence of negro sentries at
the railroad crossing to Mexico, no
evidences of Tuesday's skirmish are to
be seen. Cavalry squads ride outposts
and guards halt incoming and outgo
ing automobiles on the main roads, but
there was no excitement and little in
terest in the International situation.
In Nogales, Sonora, few soldiers
were visible from the American side.
The rumor that there were large
bodies of Yaqui Indian reinforcements
south of Nogales, Sonora, Is now con
sidered as purely a myth.

LOCAL PEOPLE CITED

FLAGSTAFF. Ariz.. Auk. 30 Four
residents of Bisbee and Lowell have
been cited to appear before Robert
Rae. food administrator for Cochise
county, to show cause why they
should not be prosecuted in the Uni
ted States courts as sugar repeaters.
They are William Hulley. John Gel
dot, H. H. Hilton and Michael Har
mon. A sugar repeater Is a person who
seeks to evade the regulations of the
United States government by buying
more than the allotment of two
pounds per person monthly, through
the subterfuge of purchasing from
more than one concern. This prac
tice is regarded as a pernicous form
of sugar hoarding which the food ad
ministration intends to halt.
According to documentary evidence
in possession of the authorities su
gar in two pound lots was shipped to
each of the above named offenders
during July from John Sexton & Co..
of Chicago. During same month su
gar cards taken out with . Phelps
Dodge Mercantile company of Bisbee
show that Hulley obtained fourteen
pounds, Gellot twelve pounds. Hilton
eight pounds and Harmon fourteen
pounds.
Under the food regulations all mail
order houses are required to furnish
reports showing sales of sugar, and
these lists are now being carefully
scrutinized, with the result that per
sons so unpatriotic as to attempt to
obtain more than their share of su
gar will find themselves In an em
barrassing position.
The penalties for hoarding sugar
under the food control act are two
years' imprisonment or $3000 fine
or both.
