BAD DM FOR

Four Days. Officials Make
No Effort to Conceal Dis

(By Review Lease TTlre)
WASHINGTON, Oct. 15 Only $156,
000,000 of new Liberty loan subscrip
tions were reported today, according
to advices from the whole nation gath
ered by the treasury. The total sub
scription so far is $2,954,870,650, still
short of the $3,000,000,000, the "half
way figure."
In view of the expectation that
fruits of Liberty day celebrations last
Saturday would be fully reflected in
today's reports, treasury officials de
clared the outlook grave.
"Those in charge of Liberty loan
campaigns made no concealment of
the fact that the situation was very
disappointing," said the official review
of the loan's progress. "With only
four days of the loan period remaining
the country now faces the task of rais
ing in excess of $3,000,000,000 or more
than $7,000,000 a day."
Early morning headquarters stimu
lated hope was not borne out by the
night's figures, that President Wil
son's rejection of the German proposal
for an immediate armistice would cre
ate a ware of enthusiasm which would
keep a multitude of subscriptions on
its crest. Tomorrow's figures will be
watched carefully for evidence of this
situation reported in scores of tele
grams from field workers.
Considering the chance that sub
scribers are delaying payments of the
first 10 per cent installment and that
consequently their pledges do not
show in the official figures, campaign
managers today urged that bond buy
ers pay down their 10 per cent install
ment immediately. This will have the
effect of relieving banks of the tre
mendous task of tabulating these pay
ments in the rush of the last hours this
week and will show the nation on Sat
urday, the final day, precisely how
big a Job Is cut out for it that day.
There is the belief, also, among some
managers that too many people are
waiting until late in the week before
Increasing their subscriptions or enter
ing new pledges. By doing this,, it
was pointed out, they will serve to
create unnecessarily long lines of pros
pective buyers at bank windows, o
to take the time of workers which
would be devoted better to stirring out
the persons who may have escaped
earlier solicitations.
Consequently, "buy now" promises
to be a companion to "double the
third" as a campaign slogan for the
remainder of the week. --
Totals of subscriptions by districts
were reported tonight as follows:

That this intensely patriotic Ameri

the fate of the bolsheviki were voiced
by George W. P. Hunt, governor of
Arizona, on the 27th day of February,
1918, is the sworn statement of Prof.
Harold G. Lawrence, at that time an
instructor in the Northern Arizona
Normal school. Lawrence's deposi
tion was today played as the trump
card of the defense in the criminal
libel action brought by Hunt against
Fred S. Breen, editor of the Coconino
Sun, and Allan B. Jaynes. editor of
the Tucson Citizen, which is being
heard before Judge R C. Stanford in
the superior court of Maricopa county.

tased. Now it is for the jurymen to mission, the state calamity board and
decide a question of verac?.y between
Hunt and Lawrence.
The article that stirred up all the
row follows:
"GOVERNOR WORRIES OVER
BOLSHEVIKI.
'A member of the N. A. N. faculty
bad occasion to call on Gov. Hunt re
cently and during the conversation,
remarked: 'Isn't this war terrible!'
The amiable governor flashed out,
'To hell with the war!' The govern
or, in his conversation, was mainly
concerned with the ultimate fate of
the Bolsheviki in Russia, seemingly
more than in the American side of
the case."
The Professor Affirms.
Publication of that arcfele got Hunt
and his cohorts all fussed up. He
swore out warrants charging Breen,
original writer and publisher, and
Jaynes, who had copied it, with crim
inal libel. But here is what Prof.
Lawrence deposes in regard to the
conversation in question:
'The subject of the war was men
tioned in the conversation. I re
marked, 'Isn't this war terrible! We
are probably in it for some 'years.'
Upon which ,the Governor turned
away in his chair toward bis desk
and in a . kind of impatient man
ner, Eaid in a low tofie, 'To hell with
the war!' The governor then began
talking about the Russian situation
and the Bolsheviki. I cannot repeat
his exact words in this connection,
but he seemed much interested in the
Bolsheviki, apparently much more
than In the American aide of the war.
I remarked that I thoroughly'believed
in education, being absolutely loyal
to the national government and to the
state government in crises of this
kind, that this had been my view in
the state from which I came and that
I intended to follow it out in the state
of Arizona. To this the governor
made no reply."
This conversation was a private
one, no one being present except the
governor and his caller. Upon his re
turn to Flagstaff, Prof. Lawrence
mentioned the matter to the editor
and proprietor of the Sun. Breen
asked his permission to publish some
thing about the educator's conversa
tion with the governor and that per
mission was given, according to Law
rence's deposition. This point is re
garded as important by the defense
as It shows that Breen did not pub
lish any idle gossip or second-hand
story. He published the flat-footed
statement of an educated man who
was willing that the statement be
given publication and wno has not
been shown to have had any personal
animosity against the governor.
The last interrogation of the Law
rence deposition was: "State wheth
er or not said publication ststes the
facts regarding what was Bald by
Governor Hunt during the conversa
tion with him at his office as you
have narrated."
To which the deponent answered
with one word, "Yes."

In the light of this situation, the

No indication has been given as to
when replies will be made by Presi

that there is no ground for the appre
hension which has arisen in Austria
that the president would refuse to re

the autocratic character of the Austri

The same is true of the Turkish ap

stead of the ordinary well controlled
artillery fire their artillery exploded
into a barage of fire on the slightest
excuse. Instead of these barages
covering any counter offensive they
were nothing more than a defensive

Nevertheless, both the Americans

The American gains in general were
accomplished through pursuance of
the strategic policy ot surrounding tbe
objectives rather than storming them.
The machine gun filled woods and
heights lying in the path ot the Amer

part by going around them on the left
and right and joining forces again on
the north side, and clearing up the
areas thus 'encircled.
The day's fighting began early when
the center moved forward and encir

mated as coming from at least 2(H)
guns concealed in the adjacent woods.

patrols pushed forward despite the
enemy opposition luto tne nanine-
ville woods.
Hill 2S6 was taken early, notwith
standing a withering machine gun fire
and a deluge ot gas shells which com
pelled the Americans to fight for
hours with their gas masks adjusted.
They also encountered vast quantities
of wire which had not been sufficient
ly cut by tbe artillery and faced an
enfilading fire from both sides.

HOOPES APPEALS
TO OUR PEOPLE
' (Hy Review Leased Wire)
DALLAS, Texas, Oct. 15. I want
to speak plainly to the man who has
not subscribed to the Liberty loan or
who has done far less than what he
knows to be his reasonable share, in
fact I want to delve to the application
of my message to tue person who has
not made a very real and definite
sacrifice in order to subscribe. If you
do not subscribe your share towards
the Liberty loan the allied nations
will still win the war. Your money
and your subscription can be dis
pensed with. Somebody also can be
trusted to come in at the last mo
ment and taking pity upon you make
sacrifices and take your share of the
burden but. ,to be perfectly frank, are
you willing to suffer this humiliation?
Think it over carefully for your peace
of mind. The respect of your neighbors
will depend upon your reply. The huge
majority of the 'people of this federal
district have shown a magnificent
spirit. Cases have developed of self
sacrificing . patriotism which have
moved witnesses to tears. The people
of the drouth stricken counties have
responded in a manner which will be
an eternal monument to their man
hood and womanhood and with regard
to the final result in this district I
can only say that notwithstanding the
fact that we are at present woefully
under-subscribed I know our people,
I know their spirit and nothing can
shake my faith in their loyalty. If
it comes to 12 o'clock ' noon next
Saturday and we are under-subscribed
my reply will be "They will do it by
midnight."

WAR 'TILL VICTORY
SAYS ROOSEVELT
(By Review Leased Wire) '
NEW YORK. Oct. 15. The immedi
ate duties before the tnited States,
Col. Theodore Roosevelt tonight told
the Liederkranz club of New York, are
to carry on the war "until we win the
peace of overwhelming victory" and to
insist on absolute Americanism in the
citizenship of the United States.
"Peace not based on the uncondi
tional surrender of Germany and her
vassal allies should not be accepted."
he declared. On the other hand he
asserted that it was a "gross infamy"
and disloyal to the true spirit of Amer
icanism, to discriminate against any
American because of German birth or
ancestry. Speaking in behalf ol the
fourth Liberty loan. Colonel Roosevelt
urged the club to support by buying
bonds, it's 200 members now in the
service. He paid high tribute to men
ot German blood who have fought for
American ideals and continued: 'If I
had been allowed to raise the divisions
for service in France which congress
authorized me to raise, I should have
made a point of having the largest
possible proportion of men of German
origin among my troops, and I should
have been nad to have served under a
major general such as Kulin. If you
will look at the casualty lists you will
see what a largo percentage of the
narneg indicate thut the bearers wc.-
of German blood. This war is indeed
the crucible, and in the actual test of
battle it is showing that Americanism
is a matter of spirit and purpose and
soul, and not of birthright or descent."

MYSTERIOUSLY
HOBOKEN, N. J., Oct. 15. Shortly
before the American troop transport,
America, formerly the German trans
Atlantic passenger steamship Anier
ika was about to sail today for Europe,
w'ith soldiers and supplies, the vessel
foundered at her pier here.
In the early morning darkness,
while the troops aboard were sleep
ing, the America settled with, her keel
in the mud, leaving only three of her
eight decks together with parts of her
funnels above water.
So far as was known there was no
loss of life. The cause of the accident
remains a mystery, even to the navy
department officials.
. The America sank In about thirty
five feet cf water and the raising ot
the ship Is not regarded as difficult.
The America, then the Amerika.
sailed on iier first voyage from New
York on October 25, 1909.
At that . tim the ship was the
largest passenger vessel ln point of
tonnage afloat, having accommodations
for 3600 passengers and about 400
crew. She was the first of the ocean
liners to be equipped with electric
elevators and in addition to having
her various salons and assembly rooms
decorated with paintings of great
Americans and American scenes her
decks, instead of being numbered, were
named after presidents of the United
States. The use of one of the im
perial suits for a voyage cost $2500.
In August, 1914, she was in New
York and remained here until the
United States entered the conflict.
Til en she was seized and taken over
by the United States shipping board,
afterwards being assigned to the navy
and designated as a troop transport.
Wilful damage to the ship by the of
ficers and men of her former crew
was repaired here at a cost of $500,000.

text of today's German official com
munication follows:
"In Flanders the enemy has resum
ed his. attack on a wide front between
Zarren and the Lys. He succeeded
in pressing forward beyond our fore
most positions. Toward noon, the
fighting came to a standstill on the
line of Cortemarck and eastward of
Roulers. which fell into the enemy's
hands after stiff fighting and south
west of Iseghem and northeast ot
Menin. Menin and Wervicq held
against strong attacks. Attempts of
the enemy to cross the Lys near Co
mines were frustrated. As the result
of renewed attacks in the afternoon
Handzalg and Cortemarck were lost.
Strong attacks led by tanks before
Gits broke down. Between Iseghem
and Menin the enemy was able to gain
a little mqre ground in the afternoon.
"There was a successful forefield
engagement west of Lille and the
Haute Deule canal. On the Selle sector
north of Haussy and near St. Souplet
partial enemy attacks broke down. In
a dense morning mist the enemy ad
vanced east of St. Quentin over the
Oise and temporarily gained a foot

and north of Origny. An extensive
counter attack drove him from the
heights back on to the Oise.
"Violent partial engagements before

of the Aisne and in the bend of the
Aisne southwest of Grand Pre occur

WASHINGTON, Oct. 15. A stamp
tax or 2 cents on all bank checks is
provided for in an amendment to the
war revenue bill adopted by the sen
ate finance committee which is revis
ing the house draft.
The amendment was adopted by i
vote of 8 to 6. Such a tax is oppose!
by tresaury department officials and
many senators because it not only
would be a serious inconvenience to
business, but would tend to discour
age thrift and encourage hoarding.
The amount of revenue from such
a tax would be small In the opinion
of experts.
Considertaion of the revenue bill
progressed so rapidly today that
Chairman Simmons tonight reiterat
ed his prediction that the bill would
be vrntlfed br about October 25.
Aside from the bank check amend
ment the only change made in the
no use stamp tax section was to ex
empt fidelity and surety bonds from
such taxes. An amendment placing
these under a monthly tax as pro
vided in the bill for casualty insur
ance was substituted
In considering the general admin
istrative provisions of the bill, the
committee endorsed (house sections
increasing the salary of the commis
sioner of Internal revenue to $10,000
and providing for the appointment of
five deputy commissioners and an as
sistant to the commissioner at an

The Mayor of Laon
When the glorious French tri-color was
run to the top of the spire of the city hall
at Laon last Sunday the mayor of Laon was
not present to witness this inspiring event.
And why was this aged and worthy man not
there to take part in the ceremony and re
joicing, that signalized the restoration of
Laon after more than four years of bond
age? Why, the Germans had taken him
and six hundred of his townsmen with
them when they hastily evacuated the city.
Now why, pray, should these devils have
taken these old men away from their
homes? What possible military object
could be served by this crime? Driven
along the roads like cattle; taken away from
their prison home just as the flags of their
deliverers gleamed through the smoke
clouds of that Sabbath day, these civilians
were hastened from bondage to bondage.
Why? Simply because the Germans ARE
devils. There is no other answer so simple,
so comprehensive and so true.
And when the brave and dashing Gen
eral Mangin and his French troops marched
into Laon arid the people came out and
cheered and laughed and cried and even
kissed the rifles of their liberators, and fell
on their knees when the tri-color kissed the
light of victory morning from the city hall
flag staff, ah, where was the old mayor of
Laon? With gray locks flying and bended
head and trembling knees, he and his six
hundred martyred townsmen toiled on east-
ward along the terrible roads choked with
the debris of defeat and crowded with
vengeful, beaten and cruel beasts. Pity them
and their fate. If ye have tear3, prepare
to shed them now for the mayor of Laon.
St. Gobain Forest, the most .impregnable
bulwark born of modern war in all the bat
tling of four years in the west, was taken
without the loss of a man or the firing of a
shot; Laon, the city impossible, and its pla
teau of defense and its forts and bastions
and trenches and supporting lines that had
mocked the greatest efforts of the French in
four years of vain assault, were taken
Sunday without stop, hindrance or loss. But
wait! There was a price. Foch's gallant
armies did not pay it ; no, it was paid by the
mayor of Laon. The Huns dragged this
old man away as the only visible token be
sides loot of their having held Laon. They
took him like the barbarians of old took
non-combatants to torture, kill and mak
sport for the women and children in the
huts at home.
Let us not, in this hour of triumph, for
get the brave mayor of Laon. It there no
way by which he can be saved? Is there
to be no retribution for this act? Ventre
St. Gris! Let us press on' to Mannheim,
this German town incarnate, and there let
us sieze the burgomaster or mayor and six
hundred of his townsmen, and let us say to
the Beast of Berlin, "deliver to us at once
unharmed the person of the Mayor of Laon
and his townsmen, lest a worse thing be
fall the mayor of Mannheim and these
ethers we have taken vith him. And if this
threat fails, let us press on yet further and
take the mayors of every German city and
the councilmen of these cities, clear up to
and including Berlin, demanding at each
capture the return of Laon's mayor. Let
there be no stopping of our armed men until
the mayor of Laon comes back to his own
and views through brimming eyes the tri
color floating from the city hall of his own
Laon. that bastion of France that has been
redeemed. Not until then will our triumph
be complete and shine clear and without
sigh or tear or blemish before mankind.
When France sought peace after the di
aster of Sedan in the Franco-Prussian war
of 1 870. Bismarck, the greatest of all Ger
man statesmen, sternly replied: "Germany
desires to promote the establishment of
peace ; the best means of assuring it is to de
prive France of her army." And if those
German words were true then, the same
A careful reading of editorial and official
c pinion expressed in France and England in
the past few days has convinced this col
umn.that generally throughout these allied
natiorre there is a deep and abiding distrust
of any possible shred of sincerity in any of
fer or acceptance Germany may make. Un
conditional surrender alone will meet the
demand of these allies who have suffered
and sacrificed so much. And Germany can
blame herself alone for the terrible situa
tion in which she finds herself today.
Berlin reports on the progress of affairs
at the battle front, often commented upon
by this column in the past, grow more gro
tesque as the allies press onward in victory,
for instance only last Monday night the Ber
lin report declared that "our armies have
just achieved final victory on the Cham
pagne front." Yes, they have achieved
"victory." After continuous fighting since
September 26, General Gouraud's Franco
American army has taken 2 1 ,000 prisoners
and six hundred cannon and advanced some
fifteen miles along a forty mile front, cap
turing forty villages and forts in the opera
tion. Quite a "victory" for Germany, this.
Again. "We repulsed the allied thrust in
Flanders Monday," complacently, and even
proudly, declares Berlin. Yes, they "re
pulsed" the allied thrust to take the Belgian
submarine bases and Lille. The French
captured Roulers in this drive, along with
2500 prisoners. The Belgians advanced
beyond Roulers and took 3000 more Ger
mans, and the British drove the foe back
far beyond Menin and slaughtered him by
the thousand with an overwhelming artil
lery fire. On this front the allies are still
pressing on. But for Berlin there is no such
thing as defeat. Berlin is only asking for
peace as a favor to the allies and out of the
goodness and kindness of her heart. Some
day the Berlin report will read: "We with
drew victoriously to prepared positions
beneath the Brandenburg gate of our father
land's capital city."
Will Wilhelm abdicate? If he were a
great man he would, and thus help greatly
the almcst hopeless cause of his unhappy
country. Napoleon did. The great
Frenchman, while still unbeaten, sacrificed
himself and his throne to save France from
invasion. It is true that afterwards he re
turned from Elba to fight at Waterloo be
fore he went to St. Helena for the last chap
ter of all. But he abdicated before the allied
advance; abdicated of his own free will and
accord. Wilhelm is quoted as having de
clared some twenty years ago that he would
sacrifice eighteen army corps before he
would give up one stone conquered by his
father in the Franco-Prussian war. Well,
he has already sacrificed many thousands
more than eighteen army corps and he must
still give up all of Alsace and Lorraine. And
he must give up still more. Will he give
it up before he is forced to do so at the
sword's point and the prison door and the
gallows' foot? .This column, from its esti
mate of his character, would say no!
In a special edition of September 1 7, of
the Stars and Stripes, edited and issued by
the men in the trenches in France, the fol
lowing appears in large letters on the first
page: "The A. E. F. to the President: If
the folks back home fall short on the bil
lions you need, Mr. President, call on us
for the balance. We like our pay, but if
we have to we can do without it. Yours
for victory, the American Expeditionary
Forces."
In giving praise for victories won to this
general and that, and to their soldiers, and
to our efforts at home, let us not overlook
the tanks. These engines of warfare, more
than any other one thing, have made it
possible for the allied troops to take impreg
nable German positoins. But for the fast,
invincible tanks of the new style of 1918
it is doubtful if we would yet have taken
that Hindenburg line.
What is that sound at the allied door?
It is the belated knock of Turkey upon the
panels. The Turk fiddled around quite a
while after the surrender of Bulgaria. He
is a little late. Let him cool his heels out
there for a spell; it will do him good, and
besides he has many and terrible crimes to
answer for. He may well tremble while he
vi aits.
A flaming torch in one hand, a drip
ping knife in the other, this is the way
Germany comes, asking for peace.
words pronounced by the mouth of the al
lies regarding the German armies of today
are a thousand times more true.

HUNT IS POOR WITNESS
imperial to Tne Review)
PHOENIX, Aru.. Oct. 15 Ueorge P.
Hunt, governor of Ariona and presi
dent of the state council of delense,
docs not know w hether the I. W. is
a disloyal organiation or not. He so
testified under oath this afternoon in
the progress of the trial of Fred S.
Breen, editor of the Coconino Sun, on
a criminal libel charge preferred by
Hunt. The only result cf the first day
of the trial was to make clear Hunt's
relations with pacifists and wobblies,
which became matters of record in
the court, bared by his own testi
mony. Under the cross-examination of
Merrill and that of Judge John Camp
bell, Hunt squirmed and broke over
the rules of judicial procedure, but
he made admission alter admission
which the defense evidently regard
ed as important.
Court Admonishes Hunt
Finally Judge Stanford took a fa
teen minutes' recess during which he
told County Attorney L. M. Laney to
admonish Hunt to cease the courage
of conduct he had been pursuing.
Went Kastner's Bail
One of Hunt's most damaging ad
missions was that he went on the bail
bond of Charles W. Kastner, a German
alien enemy, arrested for sedition and
that while Kastner was on bond Hunt
took him to Florence and got him a
job as a guard at the state peniten
tiary. It is claimed that when Kastner
left Maricopa county he violated the
terms of his bond. Later, Kastner
jumped the bond and his present
whereabouts are unknown. Hunt paid
the bond. Hunt declared in his testi
mony that he signed the bail bond
without reading It and said he did not
know the nature of the charge against
Kastner. The records show that at the
time of the alien registration Kastner
gave his address as Hunt's residence
near Phoenix.
.Damaging Letter Shown
The defense introduced a copy of
a letter from Hunt to Kastner invit
ing him to drop in. any time to have a
bite to eat and "forget the turmoil and
stri'fe of politics." Hunt said he might
have written that letter but he avoid
ed a direct answer and demanded to
know w here the attorney had procured
his personal correspondence and inti
mated that ho might prosecute. Camp
bell, backed up by former Governor
Richard E. Sloan and Judge E. M.
Doe, argued that this was material as
it showed the governor's state of mind
and proved it possible that he niiglu
have made the assertion "to hell with
the war," and expressed deep interest
in theBolsheviki, as quoted in the al
leged libelous articles.
Hunt Gets Wroth
Hunt interjected himself frequently
into the arguments of the attorneys.
' I'm the governor of this state, i
represent the people and when they
impugn my loyalty I think it a dis
grace," are extract quotations at that
period of the trial.
That Wobbly Pamphlet
Next the defense introduced a copy
of a pamphlet entitled "Is Freedom
Dead?" issued by the I. W. W. who
were tried in Chicago and since have
been convicted of sedition and dis
loyalty and now are in the federal
prison in Leavenworth, serving long
terms. In the pamphlet was a photo
graph of Hunt, Charles McKinnon and
Grover Perry, which in his Fourth of
July speech at Tucson Hunt said was
taken at Columbus. N. M.. while he
was there to investigate the Bisbee
deportation. On the stand, after much
equivocation, he said the picture had
been taken at his. Hunt's, home. He
also admitted taking 1000 copies of the
pamphlet to his home and said some
of thoni were there now. He denied
paying anything for this "wobbly"
literature.
The defence introduced a letter from
Hunt to Upton Sinclair, the noted so
cialist writer, subscribing to his maga
zine for the state university, the norm
al schools and other state institutions.
A blank claim on the state was en
closed. He did not have any reason
for supporting Sinclair's publication at
the state's expense except that he long
had been an admirer of Sinclair's as a
writer. Campbell read several extracts
from subsequent issues' of Sinclair's
magazine which plainly were disloyal.
In one it was charged that America
was paving the way for the ruling
classes of England, France and Italy
to seize German property. Hunt was
asked if he approved these utter
ances. Laney's objection to this ques
tion was sustained but not before
Hunt admitted that he, had cancellca
the subscriptions.
The witness could not remember
having visited "wobbly" headquarters
in Phoenix but admitted taking a lead
er by the name of Payne to visit mo
penitentiary in the state car. He said
Charles F. Tanmhill. a well known
1. W. W. organizer had been employed
at the penitentiary as a guard.
"Are you a member of the I. W.
V.?" Hunt was asked.
"I am not." he exploded.
"Do you regard the I. W. W. as a
disloyal organization?"
"I don't know," replied Hunt in the
lowest tone he had used iu the course
of th-j day.
Ten Another Letter
The defense produced a letter writ
ten by Hunt to Dwight B. Heard on
May 9 in which he said federal author
ities and peace officers everywhere
were taking necessary and effective
steps to deal with the 1. W. W. situa
tion. Then Campbell read from the
governor's message to the special ses
sion of the legislature last spring in
which Hunt referred to the wobblies
as outlawed and disloyal. Hrfnt said
he did not reiiiemlwr what was in the
message but would st.and by it any
way, though that conflicted directly
with his previous statement that he
did not know the wobblies. to be dis
loyal. "Do vou not know as a result of

your investigations as chaiiman of tne
state council of defense whether the
I. W. W. were disloyal," Campbell
probed. "I do not," replied Hunt.
Ain't No Such Animals
At one stage of the hearing Hunt
said e was not even certain there
were any wobblies in Arizona. He as-
' serted that certain interests accuse
anyone disagreeing with them of being
wobblies. '
Campbell Makes Charges
Hunt said he always had been with
the president, except he t though he I
should- ha-ve declared war after the
Laisitania disaster, juuge ccmpoeii
declared in his statement that he was
prepared to prove that Hunt's patriot
ism was of the lip variety but that he
did not stand behind the president and j
never had.
Memory Faulty Again.
Hunt admitted he had a call from
Prof. Hcrold G. Lawrence, then in

mal school, but said he merely had
exchanged commonplaces with him
and did not remember the war or bol
shevik! being mentioned. He denied
emphatically having said "to hell with
the war." He recalled that his secre
tary, Louis Lowenthal, stood in the
doorway of his office throughout the
conversation, though this was not his,
Lcwenthal's, custom. It is the inten
tion of the prosecution, evidently, to
have Lowenthal's us well as Hunt's
account of the conversation with Law
rence. Early in the day, Lowenthal
statPd on the stand that he had just
received an appointment to a staff
captaincy in the army on Hunt's rec
ommendation. Bought Liberty Bonds.
Hunt on the stand boasted of the
Liberty bonds he had bought, at
which Judge Campbell sarcastically
remarked that he had been buying
bonds with the salary he had never
earned.
Breen, the defendant, is the only
witness for the defense so far introduced.
New York's spreading epidemic of the
Spanish Influenza. i
Dr. Copeland said the Veils would
serve as an almost preventative and
that it may become necessary to order
everyone in New York to adopt them.
Spread of the disease has seriously
affected New York's telephone service
and the New York tekphone company
tonight sent out an appeal to sub
scribers to use the telephone only fot
urgent and necessary calls, asserting
that 20 per cent of its operators have
been laid up by influenza.

DRASTIC REGULATIONS
FOR DENVER
DENVER. Colo., Oct. 15. Nineteen
additional deaths from Spanish influ
enza were recorded in Denver in the
twenty-four hour period ending to
night. The total number of victims in
the city now is ninety-seven. The to
tal number of cases in Denver amount
ed to 1483 with the reporting of 257
new cases today.
As a result of the increased seri
ousness of the epidemic. Health Com
missioner Sharpley today, ordered the
discontinuance of all outdoor gather
ings. Indoor assemblages have been
under the ban for ten days. If the
new order remains in effect, football
games scheduled for next Saturday
will be prohibited as well as outdoor
church services planned for Sunday.
So drastic are the new regulations
drawn up today that even the prac
tice of visiting is discouraged. It has
been found that many deaths ate at
tributed to visits made to the homes
of friends who were ill.
Reports from various parts of the
state showed no let-up in the spread
of the disease. .Scores of new cases
have developed and there have been a
number of deaths.
Florence and Paonia each reported
four deaths today. Three persons have
died at Boulder in the last forty-eight
hours and two at Nederland. a town

TO THE VOTERS
We, the undersigned, citizens of
Benson. Ariz., understand that a letter
appeared in the October 4 issue oi
Dunbar's Weekly, wherein it was
stated that La Wright, on July 12.
1917. assisted in the Bisbee deporta
tions of that date.
We believe in clean campaigns, and
we do not believe that the voters o.t
Cochise county favor the election of
men through misrepresentations or
falsehoods.
We therefore address this letter in
the interest of fair play, to state that
of our ow n knowledge, Lo Wright was
in Benson during the entire morning
of July 12, 1917, and until 1 o'clock
p. m. of that day. We understand that
the deportations were over before
noon of that day. so that it would have
been an impossibility for Lo Wright to
have assisted in same, and we know
that he did not.
Lo Wright has lived in Cochfre
county for twenty years, is married
and has a family. Ills reputation and
honesty cannot be attacked. He has
proved himself to Ih a capable officer
ant! is entitled to a sq'iare deal.
We are willing to make aftidavits
of tho fuels herein slated, if necessary.

..0..1 i':ie uncertain Irregular course
t f today's stock market, speculative
:".lo.ests were less inclined to Jump
at hasty conclusions regarding the re
sult of pending developments in the
war situation.
With the exception of oils. In which
lluctuations were most bewildering,
shares favored in the preceding ses
sion, notably rilas, shippings, tobac
cos and high prtced specialties, were
under constant pressure.
United States Steel was among the
cratic leaders, regaining 24 points
from Its best and closing at a loss of
IV, points.
Marine preferred reacted 2 points
after an early show of activity and
strength, while standard rails, espe
cially Pacifies, forfeited 1 to 214
points.
Coppers and Leathers were con
sistently firm to strong, the demand
for metals centering about American
Smelting and Anaconda and Utah.
Hide ar.J Leather preferred made an
additional pain of 3 points, but fell
away later.
War stocks reflected the changed
attitude of traders, some of the more
distinctive issues rising 1 to 4 points,
with industrial alcohol add the food
i-iiares. Mexican Petroleum rallied
almost 11 points form its minimum of
the first hour, finishing at an ad
vance cf 54 points. Studebaker
gained 6 points. Sates amounted to
740.000 shares.
Railroad and industrial issues were
the strong features of the broader
bond market, the Liberty group show
ing variable tendencies, while Inter
nationals were neglected. Total sales,

WASHINGTON, Oct. 15. The cot

cotton trade and cotton goods indus
try have nothing to fear from the ac
tion of the war industries board in
providing for an allocation of cotton
and an inquiry Into the whole cotton
situation, said Clarence Ousley, as
sistant secretary of agriculture, in a
statement today outlining the reasons
for the inquiry.
Mr. Ousley said that there has not
been from the beginning nor is there
now set a purpose or desire to fix
cotton prices. It has been consid
ered. he added, only as a possible
necessity dependent upon the Infor
mation to be gathered by the cotton
committee. .
GRAIN MARKET.
(Vy Review leased Wire)
CHICAGO, Oct. 15. Sharp new
advances In the corn market ' today
resulted largely from President Wil
son's note to Germany. Latest quota
tions, although unsettled, were 2 to
4 7s net higher, with November 124
to 124 and December 121Z to 121.
(Us gained to 74 and provisions
15c to $1. ,
The definite understanding that the
federal government might finally
come into the market as a liberal
buyer tended further to discourage
speculative selling. Accordingly, of
ferings were light, and there was a
lively demand throughout the day
from shorts and commission houses,
i'it operations, however, did not pos
sess anything like the magnitude that
has been the rule of late. Reactions
which took place from the top levels
seemed to be duo altogether to col
lection of profits. At me highest
point of the session the November
optica showed an advance of nearby
16 rents a bushel compared with the
inside figures of 24 hours before.
Oats went up grade with corn. Do
mestic shipping demand was good.
Word of probable big export require
ments gave decided strencth to pro
visions and po likewise d?d upturns
in the value of corn and hogs.

The soldier in the trenches has need
many times of just such a short piece
of pencil with which to write a few
hasty words to his loved ones, or to
fill several pages if he has the time.
It comes direct from the boys "over
there" that they are in urgent need
of short pencils. They beg to have
them sent over. So it came to the
ears of a woman who immediately
conceived the idea of collecting all
those waste bits of lead for America's
fighting boys. Never again can pencil
stubs seem useless, for the very sight
of one means an opportunity of doing
a patriotic service by sending them
to our soldiers abroad.

ave a Pencil Stub
It seems a small bit to save one pen
cil stub yet the accumulation
amounts to about 30.000 a month, and
that number barely fills the demand.
The University of Chicago: sends
thousands of the little pieces to be
distributed to the boys in France.
The work has become a real part of a
hetpful branch of war work which
takes upon itself the business of for
warding the thousands of short pencils
each, month that will enable our boys
to send the message home that is
freighted with import to the loved
ones.
Many are the letters of appreciation
sent by American soldiers to the or
ganization that collects these pencil
stubs. A long pencil is inconvenient
for the soldier, as he has no way of
carrying it. Besides, it is hard for
him to purchase even a lead pencil
for lack of money or' opportunity.
Short pencils can be tucked away in
his pockets and are handy to use in
odd moments.

The last three mentioned sites of

resolutions submitting the above
mentioned sites and taking over the
custody of the signed options.
The courthouse site committee, rep

Luxembcirg chamber of deputies has

The city of Bisbee is now on the
ballot and in the event that the voters
decide to move the county seat Doug
las will not be the only candidate, as
she hoped to be, say members of the
committee. In view of the many
friends Tombstone has here and in
the northern part of the county, and
the conditions of the times prevail
ing generally. It is not Jikely that the
subject of courthouse removal would
have been brought up at this time had
it not been for the persistent efforts
of our Bister city of Douglas, the town
pride and progressive spirit of whose
citizens must be admired, but when
it comes to a show down and a case
of removal, it will be found that the
Warren district from the standpoint
of convenience' utility, and economy,
should have first considertaion, and
the town building, progressive spirit
of her property-owners and voters will
be in evidence aplenty at the polls.
