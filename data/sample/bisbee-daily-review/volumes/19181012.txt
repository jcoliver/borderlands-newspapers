lean troops have been lost as the
result of the sinking of the trans
port Otranto in the North Chan
nel between the Scottish and
Irish coasts in a collision with the
steamer Kashmir.
The Otranto, after the collision,
was dashed to pieces on the rocks
off the south Scottish coast with
a probable loss of 372 American
soldiers.
Three hundred and one men were
taken to Belfast by the British de
stroyer Mounsey, the only vessel
which made an rttempt at rescue in
the terrific pale, when the Kashmir,
another vessel in the convoy with
the Otranto, rammed the Otranto
amidships.
Seventeen men were picked up alive
on the Scottish coast.
Of the 699 American soldiers on
board the Otranto, 310 were landed.
Seventeen were rescued alive at
Islay, leaving- 372 unaccounted for.
The Otranto and the other vessels
of tbe convoy were battimg with the
heavy seas and high winds Sunday
morning. The storm was so severe
and the visibility so bad that tbe
Kashmir, a former Peninsular &
Oriental liner, crashed into the
Otranto squarely amiasmps.
The Kashmir backed away badly
damaged, but was able to make port.
As the bows of the Kashmir were
pulled from the great hole in the side
of the Otranto, the water rushed in,
but for a time it did not serve to stop
the engines. Tbe Otranto tried to
proceed but made no headway against
the gale in her crippled condition.
The Otranto struck the rocks Sun
day night south of Saligo bay, Islay
island, an uninhabited section where
the coast line in many places rises
straight out of the water to the rocky
peaks many feet above.
As the destroyer neared the side
of the Otranto tbe men began to
jump from 30 to 40 feet from her
decks. The more experienced sail
ors of the crew of the steamer had
better success than the soldiers, many
of whom bad never seen the"sea until
this trip.
As the destroyer steered toward
the side of the steamer many of the
men leaped too quickly and missel
thir reckoning and dropped between
the boats. Some of them disappeared
in the water, but others of them
were caught and crushed to death be
tween the boats and the lifeboats
which had been lowered fo act as
buffers. The destroyer was badly
battered.
The captain of the destroyer, each
time it was brushed away from the
side of the Otranto again would push,
near enough for many more men to
.lump to the deck of his vessel. He
described as a veritable rain the,
number of men landing on the de
stroyer. Many of those who reached the !
decks of the vessel suffered broken I
bones or otherwise were hurt. Those I
who missed the deck of the destroyer
went to almost instant death.
Four times the battered destroyer,
came alongside and each time the'
previous scenes were repeated. At
the end of the fourth time she had
310 Americans, 236 of the crew, 30
French sailors and one British offi
cer on board. The boat was full and.

General March, chief of staff at his
weekly conference today sounded
an urgent call for popular support
for tbe fourth Liberty loan in or

have full support.
"This is no time to h;ing back with

March said. "The thing to do i3 to

Turning to the great war map. Gen- j
eral March pointed out the sweeping '
advance, of the Anglo-American forces
in the Cambrai-St. Quentin region
With the capture of Le Cateau, he
said, the British have gained fourteen
miles in three ays, "more thau they
gained in any consecutive three days
since they first started their drive
easl of Amiens in August."
"The enemy's resistance temporarily
at least was badiy shaken and disor
ganized," General March said. "At Le
Cateau the British are only fourteen
miles from Aulnoye. This town is a
very important strategical point. It
is the Junction of the main railroad
which I have spoken about before run
ning from1 Valenciennes through to
Metz, and tbe other great northern
artery called the Liege-Maubeuge rail

point. An advance of about nine miles j
in this direction will put that junction I
under gun fire and it is a point of j
vital importance. j
"On Tuesday and Wednesday the i
French and American forces attacked
east of the Meuse and advanced one

miles, clearing the right flank of the
main American advance. Here, as at

(HV Review Leased Wire)
WASHINGTON. Oct. 11 Proposals
of peace on the part of Turkey, re
ported in London dispatches, had not
been received in Washington to
night. State department officials ex
pressed deep interest in the reported
move by the Turkish government, but
staled positively that no proposal had
reached them.
At tlie Spanish embassy, which has

IVfinite peace proposals by Turkey

that Turkey was to dispatch a note
similar to that sent by Germany and
Austria-Hungary and in view of the
fact that . none has been received
there has been a feeling In some quar
ters for .several days that a definite
af.pial might be forthcoming soon.
The setting up of a new government

WASHINGTON. Oct. 11. Cele
bration of Liberty day tomorrow
throughout the nation is expect
ed by fourth Liberty loan man
agers to send the campaign for
ward with a jump from the $2,269,
876.200 total where the record
stood tonight. This represented
an increase of $245,000,000 over
yesterday's total and included few
subscriptions lecorded today fol
lowing President Wilson's appeal
for an over-subscription to give
the loan world-siunificance.
Public meetings and parades, ar
ranged for Liberty day, have been call
ed off nearly everywhere because of
the influenza epidemic, but thou
sands of volunteers have been enlisted
for house to house canvasses. Stores
v.-ill close for the day, or half the day,
in many cities. In Washington, the
importance of the day as a stimulus to
the loan is considered so great that
most government departments will
suspend business to permit employes
and officials to give all their energy
to the loan. President Wilson will
take part in the celebration at New
York and Secretary McAdoo at Chi
cago. Commenting on the day's showing
the treasury review tonight said:
"In the face of high officials' pleas
for united support of the loan and
emphatic declarations that peace talk
should not cause a slackening of sub
scribing this result and the outlook
for the success of the loan is distinct
ly disappointing."
Rumors reaching headquarters to
day indicating suspicion .that actual
figures are being held back, drew from
the treasury this denial:
"Inasmuch as the belief is preval
ent in some quarters .that reports on
subscriptions are being withheld in
an endeavor to create a bear impres -
sion it seems proper to explain the
manner in which the official figures
are obtained and made public. Every
afternoon at 3 o'clock Washington
time the twelve federal reserve banks
of the country report to the treasury
department every subscription made
through incorporated banks and trust
companies, on which deposits of 10
per cent have been paid. These reports
are made public absolutely without
change. The figures are taken directly
from telegrams sent by the governor
of each federal reserve bank and in
corporated into the press statement.
No attempt is made to create by those
figures either a good or bad impres-
sion of the manner in which the loan
is nroeressine. The whole truth of
is progressing. The whole truth of
the situation is told by the figures and
they speak for themselves."
The loan review added:
"Briefly. stated, the situation tonight
is that $532,000,000 must be subscribed
on every one of the remaining seven
working days of the loan if the total

that the Germans heard them rrom

through the forest and. in its eager- i
nesB to eaten up witn tne retreating
Germans, gradually spread out and
widened its ranks. This allowed the
Germans to infiltrate unseen behind
the Americans and they fell directly
into a cunning trap which the Ger
mans had set for them.
The enemy had planned to catch the
Americans in a hollow surrounded on
all four sides by heights, the great
est of which was a sleep hill directly
ahead. The Americans w ere not accus
tomed to forest fighting and were
filled with eagerness dashed into this
hollow without stopping to thiuk that
the enemy might be awaiting them.
The members of the battalion were at
first checked by their own artillery
barrage which had worked steadily
forward. Nevertheless , it had not
worked as fast as the troops them
selves and the battalion proceeded
half way up the hill and there they
waited for the barrage to pass in front
of them. Then they discovered that
the Germans on both sides had jointly
flanked them and had closed in upon
their rear.
Sheltered only in shallow and hast

were subjected to a grilling sniping
machine gun fire as well as a trencn
mortar bombardment every time they
showed themselves. Only with the
greatest difficulty and with extreme
caution could they move from place to
place and keep guard against surprise
attacks.
The battalion had started with mea
ger rations expecting more to reach
them later. These, of course could
no longer be transported to them. It
was the greatest good fortune that
they were fairly well supplied with
water.
Nightly and daily, too, they sent
back volunteers scouting parties, but
if these reached the positions in the
rear without being captured or killed
they could not tell, for none ever re
turned. Daily American aviators searching
vainly for them flew over head, but
no outcry the men could make brought
anything but a volley of shots and
laughter from the Germans in front
and behind and to the right and left of
them.
The beleaguered men discovered
there were German machine gun nests
all around them every fifteen feet or
so and for a man to show himself
ever so briefly was the signal for a
sweeping rain of bullets. If a man
made an unusual noise trench mortara
pounded the vicinity viciously. j
Just for diversion the enemy made
a practice of sweeping the whole ter- i
rain the hillside where the Impro
vised trenches were located and the
valley in which men crawled to get
leaves and water regularly and then
irregularly with machine guns.
Snipers were constantly on watch.
German 77's pounded the locality and
hand grenades also were hourly in
evidence. The Americans had no
rockets or other signals and they were I
powerless to attact the attention of
anyone but the Germans.
As the days passed the Americans
grew more and more emaciated and
more and more bearded, but they nev
er gave up hJije. There was nothing
but a grim determination to hold out
until the last man was finished.
There was not a man in the battalion
wounded or otherwise, hungry or
starved, but scouted the idea of sur
render. Their ammunition was de
pleted to a point where the few ma
chine guns in the outfit had but one
belt of cartridges apiece and the rifle
ammunition was running so short that
they had received orders not to fire at
anyone attacking until within such
short range that his death or serious
injury was almost inevitable.
Major Whittlesay, who is a' well
known New Yorker, had his entire
battalion behind him to a man, Cpt.
Leo Stromee of San Bernardino, Calif.,
told the. Associated Press. His men
jeered at the idea of surrender and
the men who came out of the four day
siege are united in declaring that they
never would have given up.

having done all possible, sne scarfed

The survivors saw the Otranto
drifting helplessly toward the rocks
as they pulled away toward the Irish
coast. The destroyer barely had time
to send a brief message when her
wireless was carried away. The lit
tle overloaded vessel had a rough trip
to port.
One of the American soldiers on
board the Otranto pictured the scene
when the vessels collided. Soldiers
lined the decks as though on parade
and at the word of command stood
at attention like statues. They never
wavered, remaining there in military
formation, exemplifying during the
crisis the noblest traditions of the
army for heroism and discipline.
The same thing, said the soldier, ap
plied to the seamen.
Numbers of bodies today were be
ing washed up rapidly on the shore.
It was reported that 175 had been
counted at noon and nearly all of
them had been identified.
Within a short time the water put
cut lien fires and the Otranto drift
ed helplessly toward the rock coast
of Islay island, where most of the
Tuscania victims met their deaths.
A seaman on the Otranto described
the most tiagic moment of the dis

The Princes of Germany Are Shaking Dice
for the United States! '
By HERBERT QUICK
WE must buy bonds to the last
cent of our ability, because our
country is fighting for its very life.
Make no mistake, citizens of Amer
ica, the crisis is just that we are
fighting for our very life.
We must fight this war through.
We must fight it through to a peace,
the basis of vhich will be written by
us and our Allies. i
Germany must not write a single
clause in the Treaty. She must be
whipped until she will sign a treaty
every word of which will be drawn
by the Allies. Germany must not be
allowed to dot an i or cross a t.
Why? '
Because Germany has become,
nothing but a robber empire, a mur
derer empire, an empire every pur
pose of which is the enslavement of
the rest of the world. Such purposes
admit of no compromise. We must
conquer or die. If we do not conquer
we shall, nevertheless, die and die
slaves.
Germany began with the intention
cf robbing France of her iron, her
coal, her best land and her greatest
factories; of making Belgium with
her rich mines, great cities and im
mense factories a part of Germany;
of gaining the Belgian coast, from
which she might conquer England,
and of combining under her flag the
hordes of Mohammedan Turks, and
ail' the Balkan States, so that she
might train soldiers in countless mil
lions, build navies to sweep the
oceans, and conquer the world.
This was was to be a step toward
world conquest.
If we do not fight the war through
to complete victory she will still keep
on and she will succeed. She will
surely succeed!
Russia with her nearly 200,000,000
people lies prostrate at Germany's
feet. Germany could now give up
the Balkan States, give up Belgium,
force Austria to yield up the Italian
territories, give up conquered France,
yes, she could give up these, and even
Alsace-Lorraine, and if allowed a free
hand in Russia, she would still have
won a victory greater than any of
which she ever dreamed at the begin
ning of the war.
Give her control of Russia and she
can and will, within a lew years
come back with power to take back
Alsace-Lorraine, crush poor Belgium
once more and destroy! exhausted
France, sweep every vestige of resist
ance from Europe, Asia and Africa,
and then what?
Then she will thunder at our doors
from Asia she will invade us on the
west, from Europe on the East, and
froni Mexico on the South.
If Germany has control over the
terms of peace, we who read this will
live to see one of the Kaiser's six sons
Emperor of America.
The time to whip Germany is now!
It is now or never!
The princes of Germany are shak
ing dice for the United States!
It will take money, money, money,
that we may send men, men,, men!

"Between the Argonne and the

has been stiff fighting for local points
of advantage and the pocket in the

"The constant pressure at many

"A raft was launched and some fif

captain, they took aboard two seamen.
The submarine then picked up the
executive officer from the wreckage
and went alongside the raft, taking
off the first assistant engineer and re
turning the two seamen to the raft.
The men on the raft asked for medi

raft and five men from the raft were
transferred to the boat with the Idea
of tying a line to the raft, but this
could not be done and the wind pre

A NERVOUS WRECK
From Three Years' Suffering. Sayi
Cardui Made Her WeO.
Texas City, Tex. In an interesting
'statement, Mrs. G. H. Schill, of this town,
says: "For three years I suffered untold
agony with my head. I was unable tb
do any cf my woik.
I just wanted to sleep all the time, for
that was the only ease I could get, when
I was asleep. I became a nervous wreck
just from the awful suffering with my
head.
I was so nervous that the least noise
would make me jump out of my bed. I
had no energy, and was unable to do
anything. My son, a young boy, had to
do all my household duties.
I was not able to do anything until I
took Cardui. I took three bottles in all
and it surely cured me of those awful
headaches. That has been three years
ago, and I know the cure is permanent,
for I have never had any headache since
taking Cardui. . .
Nothing relieved me until I took Cardui.
It did wonders for me."
Try Cardui for your troubles made
from medicinal ingredients recommended
In medical books as being of benefit in
lemale troubles, and 40 years cf use has
proven that the books are right. Begin
taking Cardui today. NC-134

M There is a plain
fact that every Amer-
M ican business man
must face. This war
f is not a dollar war.
H It is a war for justice,
jg for truth, for right,
H and for human de-
g cency. Its financial
M aspects are minor
H aspects when mea-
p sured against terms
if of human suffering
M
gi and bloodshed.
g But still the question must be asked and must be answered
by American men: " Shall the German mark conquer the Amer-
g ican dollar?"
1 What the Dollar Stands For
H The American dollar stands for a business world of square dealing, of
If equal opportunity to all people, of free commercial intercourse all over
the world. I
HI You know what the German mark stands for a commercial system as an
H active instrument of foul plotting, espionage, and Prussian propaganda.
1 Enlist Your Dollars
j ' Every American dollar must be enlisted in the great army thzt is now j
l being mobilized against die Potsdam autocracy the great army of the

j Enlist your dollars to win a world in which fair dealing and an equal

Columbus Day
Just four hundred and twenty-six years
ago today Columbus sighted the shores of
America from his little ship. He saw a
wild land peopled by savage tribes. And
today this land (sends back to the land
whence Columbus came two million fight
ing men in ships. It sends shot and shell
and engine and airplane and gold and food
and workmen and all things needed to help
Europe win her greatest war.
Four hundred years is not a long time
in which to change a wild land into a rich
and finished nation. How could that
simple mariner be given to know that in a
few hundred years a new people would
forge upon those desolate shores a thun
derbolt that should save his own Italy and
the nations of France and England from the
Hun?
Columbus Day! It marks a marvel of
the world. And in our immense pride,
let us be meek and humble and think of that
bold mariner and that small ship that came
first to the cradle of the western race. We
are so young. Who can see beyond the cur
tain that parts us from the future years?
Have mercy on this new people, Lord!
Be not deceived. Note again how the
bulletins and headlines of the battle mis
lead. During Friday's "German rout" the
allies actually advanced three miles from
Bohain to Le Cateau and their progress was
opposed savagely by countless machine
guns that had to be cleared by tanks.
This is a German retreat ; not a rout. There
is a vast difference. In Wisconsin cities a
night or two ago they rung bells and lighted
fires to celebrate the victorious end of the
war. Some fool had sent the word by
telephone to another fool and the foolish
ness began. There is no more actual con
dition of military events to warrant "such a
celebration right now than there was two
years ago when the Russians took Lem
burg and Rumania entered the war. We
have merely turned the tide of defeat and
invasion. The war is yet to win. The bad
effects of this foolish overconfidence are
apparent right now in the dragging of the
fourth Liberty loan. The German peace
poison is taking effect, just as Germany
hoped it would do. And the ill effects of
the last Wilson note are felt here, as well
as in Germany, where they were intend
ed to do harm. A mighty and unbroken
German army still stands between the al
lies and complete victory. It has been
beaten back from far advanced lines on al
lied soil, that is all.
The Warren district, with its twenty-five
thousand population thinks its quota of one
million, four hundred thousand dollars for
the fourth Liberty loan is not small, and it
is proud of its patriotism and big generous
heart, in already reaching eighty per cent
of its quota, which is far ahead of a ma
jority of the rich and populous communi
ties of the union. And the Warren dis
trict has a right to be proud, for it has al
ways done mighty well in every war work.
But in comparison with some of those lit
tle cities in far off Wales, its record shrinks
to most moderate proportions. H. M. Jones
of Bisbee has just received a Welsh paper
that sets forth some marvelous figures re
garding the subscriptions of these Welch
cities to the last British loan. Aberystwyth,
a town of nine thousand, subscribed over
three million dollars worth of bonds in one
week, or $375 for ea- h one of her nine
thousand souls. Britor. Ferry, a smaller
town, has subscribed five million dollars
worth of bonds since the war began. Swan
sea, another small city, subscribed six mil
lion dollars in one week and in the six
months' time previous to jand including
this week had subscribed fifteen million
With the cunning of the serpent Ger
many appeals to America in this matter of
peace. America is so far away from the
bloody and dishonorable scenes of Ger
man ruthlessness. No American women
were torn from Lille and taken away in
fclavery. No Ameiican children have been
crucified. No American cities have been de
stroyed or bombed. American killed and
wounded in this war have been very small
in comparison with the hundreds of thou
sands of Frenchmen and Englishmen who
have died for the cause. So to America the
Hun comes. And America should be humble
and backward and -low to speak of any
thing but war to the end and of retribution
and of unconditional surrender. The more
this column reflects upon the last Wilson
note, the more it is inclined to wish that it
had not been written. Germany is beyond
the pale. She still burns and pillages and de
stroys those fair cities of France and Bel
gium as she has always done. Her heart
is black and bloody still. To treat with her
in any way is craven folly. Any peace,
even complete surrender, short of the total
defeat of the German army and the invas
ion of Germany, will be a mistake that will
some day have to be paid for. Mark it well !
Any armistice or peace agreement pro
posed before dvery JGerman scfldier has
been withdrawn from Alsace-Lorraine and
the restoration of these provinces to France
agreed to by the German government and
people will be bitterly opposed by this col
umn to the end. Anything short of the
return of the lost provinces to France will
be not only defeat to the allied nations,
but a disgrace. France has suffered and
bled greviously and she has fought glori
ously. It would be base desertion of a
grand friend to allow the Hun one foot of
French ground if we have to fight on for
two years longer.
Boy, page ramshackle Russia for Messrs.
Lenine and Trotzky. No word has been
heard direct from these two worthies for
quite some time. Their views upon the
Bulgarian surrender and the victories in the
west and the kaiser's call of "Kamerad '
should make good reading right now. An
accounting for the Bolsheviki betrayal of
the allied cause is drawing very near. But
there is this to be said always for Lenine
and Trotzky, considering the brief time
they have been on the job, they have done
more to bring about the complete ruin of
Russia than any pair of knaves in all the
history, of all the crimes in the world could
have done. AND, they are still on the job.
Some people may have thought that the
claim that the Americans stopped the Prus
sians at Chateau Thierry on their way to
Paris wa3 mostly American brag. But the
cold facts and figures now coming in on
that Chateau Thierry affair bear out the
claim in its entirety In one sector of that
fight eight thousand American marines held
the line. Well, when the battle was over
six thousand of these marines were either
killed or wounded. Naturally, in the face
of courage and resolution and sacrifice like
this the Prussian was stopped dead and fin
ally driven back. " ,
This column asked a mine manager, a
business man, a clerk and a carpenter yes
terday for their views on the German effort
to secure peace at this time and they were
all agreed as one man, speaking in voice,
that the allies should not treat with the
kaiser or any of his house or military staff
for peace at all, and that the only terms to
Germany should be unconditional surren
der. And to these views this column says,
"Amen!"
Let the primer class stand up, please.
Now then, D is for Douai, set on fire by
the Huns when threatened with capture.
Douai is a beautiful and famous French
city. D is also for Dusseldorf, a famous
city of Germany. A "D" for a "D." Why
not an alphabetical retribution? The Huns
looted and partially destroyed Cambrai.
A. "C" for a "C." C also stands for
Cologne !
Reverting again to that opinion in the
matter of Colter's eligibility, handed down
by the Hon. Wiley Jones. Colter might
well say to Jones, even as Job said to his
comforter, Bildad, the Shuanite: "Ye are
the people and all wisdom will die with
ft
you.
American public sentiment to Foch:
"Lay on, Macduff, and damned be he, who
first cries, 'hold, enough!' "
Thanks to TWO OFFICERS
England
(Kansas City Star.)
Most Americans have had an idea
that the United States had reached
a point in naval construction where
if it could not furnish most of the
transports to carry its soldiers over
seas, at least it could provide the de
stroyers to convoy the transports
Official figures disclose how erron
eous this opinion is.
Last month America furnished the
ships including the Gemma liners
for about 40 per cent of the troops
transported, while of the tonvoyin
so far done, 70 per cent is credited to
British vessels.
It is worth while to bear these fig
ures in mind for two reasons. In the
first place, they will help us under
stand the magnitude of Britain's help
to us in getting our m-jn to France,
and in the secorfd plac, they will
emphasize the need of maritime pre
paredness. We have .now been at war
for e. year and a half. In that lime
we have been feverishly building mer
chant vessels and destroyer:, with all
our enormous energy. And yet the
bulk of the work at sea still falls oa
our great ally.
A nation simply cannot prepare for
war after war comes, unless it has
powerful friends able to do the fight
ing for it for considerably more than
a year.
A Plea For
TomMaddock
Editor Review:
I wish to make this as a public ap
peal to the patriotism of Arizona, in
behalf of the fathers and mothers of
our boys "over there," an appeal to
the patriotic voter of the state to sup
port for congress, Lt. Thomas Mad
dock, who is "over there' 'and is now
fighting that the world may be free.
Lieutenant Maddock as a boy worked
as a bell hop at a hotel at Williams,
supported a widowed mother, studied
engineering, and was later made state
engineer, became a contractor, was
married and has a wife and little chil
dren provided for until his return from
the war. A record of this kind has
no comparison. The question to us is,
Will Arizona become the shame of the
world by electing a man who has
proven himself in congress against our
boys, by his votes against all war
measures? Will they defeat a man
who headed the call of our president
and went to war?

GERMANS FLEE

OF NECESSITY
(Continued from Pass One)
the Americans are still progressing
satisfactorily.
The retreat of the enemy along the
25 miles of the western line from
(Douai to the southeast of the St.
Quentin, still is too fast, except on
isolated sectors, for the foot troops
of the British. American and French,
to keep in contact with him. The
cavalry and tanks on the plains and
through the wooded sectors, however,
have taken a terrible toll from the
rear guards, while, still further back,
allied airmen are cutting to pieces the
columns of the bewildered foe, as they
try to make their way to' their next
defense line. Virtually no infantry
action Is being encountered. The ma
chine gun seemingly is being chiefly
depended upon by the Germans to
hold back the foe as their main forces
retire.

FRENCH OFFICIAL
PARIS, Thursday, Oct. 10. The text
of today's French official statement
follows:
"East of St. Quentin our troops, now
in close contact, have continued to
pursue the enemy whose rear guard
is offering serious resistance. We
have advanced six kilometers at cer
tain points. Our lines now run from
the east of Seboncourt to the suburbs
of Bernoville, east of Montigny-En-Ar-ronairse
and thence to Bernot. We
have occupied numerous villages in
cluding Fieulaine. Neuvillette, Kegny,
Chatillon-Sur-Oise and Thenelles.
"South of the Oise we have cap
tured Hervais and have made pris
oners. "Between the Ailette and the Aisne.
pressure exerted by our troops aud b
certain Italian units operating in con
junction with us in the vicinity of the
Chemin Des Dames, compelled the
Germans to withdraw beyond the Oise
canal. In the course of the day net
withstanding the violent machine gun
fire of the enemy we took possession
of Beaulne-Et-Chivy, Verneuil-Courton-ne
and Bourg-Et-C'omin.
"At the same time French units
crossing the river Aisne to the east of
Oeuilly drove back the enemy to the
north and occupied Parguan and Beau
rieux. "Further to the east we delivered a
spirited attack to the north of Berry-Au-Bac,
gaining ground and taking
prisoners.
"In the Champagne the enemy, worn
out by heavy fighting which has been
going on without interruption since
September 26 on the front of the
fourth army, began to retreat this
morning in the direction of the Aisne.
Our infantry, following on the heels
of the enemy rear guards attempting
to check our advance, passed through
the village of Liry, Monthois and Chal
lerange and reached the outskirts of
.Mont Saint Martin and St. Morel.
"Farther to the rifcht wo crossed
the river Aisne opposite Termes,
which town we captured. We occupied
the railroad station of Grand Pre
where we took numerous prisoners.
"Aviation, Oct. 9: A very large num
ber of aerial reconnaissances were
made well over the enemy lines with
success. Important assemblies of
the enemy were reported in the region
of Etraye, Manvillers and Mourey.
"French bombing machines operat

with most satisfactory results, 32,6oo

acme effect on trade, which reflects
some hesitation, and the pace of in

try with epidemic of iuiluenza which
has hampered industry, resulted in the
promulgation of health regulations,
the closing of some theaters and

Liberty loan campaign also has di

PATTEE HOLDS LAW
FOR CAR SEIZURE TO
BE UNCONSTITUTIONAL
PIMA COUNTY SUPERIOR COURT
JUDGE RENDERS DECISION IN
CASE WHERE CAR TRANSPORT
ING BOOZE HAD BEEN
SEIZED
TUCSON, Ariz., Oct 11. The auto
mobile seizure law, supplementary
prohibition legislation enacted at the
special session of the legislature last
June, was declared unconstitutional
yesterday by Judge S. L. Pattee of the
superior court in a memorandum ac
companying his decision in two cases
in which the forfeiture of automobiles
had been sought by the state.
The cases were the state against
one Paige automobile and the state
against one Dodge automobile. The
claimants were, respectively, Marcus
Nevarres and McArthur Brothers.
The measure is understood to have
been framed by T. K. Marshall, presi
dent of the state temperance federa-
and the legal advisers of the federation.
The Paige automobile was seized by
Sheriff Miles under forfeiture proceed
ings instituted by County Attorney
Moore, following the conviction and
sentencing of Frazier and Robles on
the charge of bootlegging and using
the car in question in transporting the
liquor.
The Dodge automobile is the proper
ty of J. Q. Clifford. He turned it in
to McArthur Brothers, after buying
a new car, to be sold by them. The
car was allowed to go out of the gar
age iu the belief that it was to be tried
out by a prospective purchaser, who
proved, to be George Mularkey, who
was arrested the night following the
borrowing of the car on the charge of
transporting liquor, using the Dodge
car for that purpose.
These were the first two arrests fol
lowing, the enactment of the seizure
law. "
Demurrers Sustained
The claimants also filed suit against
Sheriff Miles to recover possession :
the seized automobiles and to the
sheriffs answer, setting forth the
facts contained in the county attor
ney's Information in the forfeiture pro
ceedings, the ' plaintiffs demurred.
The question upon which the cases
were decided wag upon the sustaining
Y. M. C. A. CAMP AT
LEWIS SPRINGS TO
BE CARRIED ON
Earl V. Thompson, boys' secretary,
has announced that the Y. M. C. A.
camp at Lewis Springs will be con
tinued for at least two more weeks if
the quarantine is on that long. There
are twenty-two boys at the springs
now and more are coming each day.
The grub costs the boys about $4.50
which is a very low price compared
to the high cost of living.
So far the" camp has been very suc
cessful and the boys who have attend
ed it. have had a very fine time. Mr.
Thompson, who is in charge of the
camp, wishes that all the boys who
can get away would come down and
spend a few nights away from the
' Spanish Flu."

FUNERAL TOMORROW.
The funeral services of George
Spears, who died last week at the
Murietta Hot Springs will be held to
morrow af tern on at 12:30 o'clock from
the Palace undertaking parlors. Ow-i
ing to the fact that no public funerals
are to be held during the period of the
quarantine, the services will be con
ducted under the auspices of the
Knights of Pythias lodge officers, of
which the deceased is a member.
RAINED IN SPOTS.
Parties coming in last evening from
the Sulphur Spring valley state that

ley yesterday afternoon. At one
place, between Webb and Elfrida, the

Are you bothered with too frequent
action of the kidneys? Are the secre
tions highly colored do they contain
sediment burn and scald in voiding?
These are all signs of kidney sickness
and should not be neglected. Bisbee
people recommend Doan's Kiney Pills.
If your back aches and your kidneys
are weak you will find no better
recommended remedy.
Chas. Rendleman, miner, 158 Opera
Drive, Bisbee, says: "Twelve years
ago my kidneys were in an awful
shape. I could hardly move my back
wag so lame and stiff. My kidneys
were weak and acted irregularly. Th
kidney secretions were highly colored
and I had to get up often at night
to pass them. When I tried to bend
over, sharp pains would dart through
my back and I would becomo dizzy.
A friend told me about Doan's Kidney
Pills and I tried them. Two boxes of
Doan's completely cured mo. Since
then, I have used a few of Doan's Kid
ney Pills occasionally and they have
kept my kidneys well and strong."

VOLUNTEERS SEARCH
FOR SUGAR SLACKER
THROUGHOUT ARIZONA
MAN OR WOMAN WHO CARRIES
SMALL EXTRA SUPPLY ON HIS
OR HER PERSON FOR SURREP
TITIOUS USE NOW IS SOUGHT
FOR
FLAGSTAFF, Ariz., Oct. 11.
Three hundred and thirty-seven in
spectors and other volunteer officials
of the food administrators are on the
trail of the sugar slacker in Arizona
The sugar slacker, if you please,
is the gentleman who carries an enve
lope filled with sugar which he quiet
ly slips out of an inside pocket when
his tea or coffee is served. As a rule,
sad to relate, he wears a Liberty bond
button' and talks vehemently against
any thought of making peace.
Or mayhap, the sugar slacker is a
woman with a service star pinned to
her breast She is longing for the safe
homecoming of a dear one over there,
while at the same time, she is helping
to deprive him of the sugar, which
he as a fighter is entitled to, and
which she is not. -
Sugar slackers mjy be divided
roughly into two groups. One is com
posed of selfish individuals who do
not ponder over the patriotic or econ
omic reasons for a food administration
or sugar regulations. The other group
is composed of thoughtless persons
who do not realize their unpatriotic I
attitude in taking an extra allowance
of sugar.
But of whichever class the sugar
slackers have a nice large surprise in
store for them, in which legal docu
ments and publicity will play leading
parts.
The enforcement division of the
food administration says that every
sugar slacker is a sugar, hoarder, in
that he is exceeding the government
allowance, and is therefore subject to
a severe penalty.
The publicity division says that
there is no law that will stop the pub
lication of names in connection wit'u
formal charges preferred by the gov
ernmenL Between these two divisions of the
food administration there promises to
be "plenty doing" for the sugar slack
er from now on.

or overruling of the demurrers. The
court sustained them and dismissed
the proceedings.
In denying that the court had juris
diction, the automobile claimants,
through their legal representatives, at
tacked the constitutionality of the law
on three grounds:
Three Point of Attack
1 That the governor's proclama
tion calling the legislature into special
session did not provide for such legis
lation. 2 That the automobile seizure was
an additional punishment over and
above the penalty specified in the
state constitution.
3 That the law violated both the
state and federal constitutions In that
it did not provide the owner of an
automobile seized under the law with
due process of law to combat forfei
ture proceedings.

LOCALEPIDEMIC
STILL UNABATED
The local epidemic of Spanish influ
enza continued to grow without abate
ment yesterday, according to report
from Dr. Brown,' city health officer.
More than half a hundred new cases
were reported while one death occur
red as a result of pneumonia following
influenza.
The one bright spot in the situation
is the fact that most of the cases dis
covered have been more or less mild
in form, while the pneumonia record
has been held to a minimum.
On account of the fact that many
people in the district hold the disease
in contempt and insist upon inter-
visiting and in keeping the sick and
the well together in crowded quarters.
Dr. Brown does not anticipate an
early abatement of the malady here.
He urges upon the public that pro
miscuous visiting should not be in
dulged in, for though the person mak
ing the visit may not contract the di
sease, he or Bhe may carry it to oth
ers more susceptible than themselves,
with the result that they will contract
it, possibly in aggravated form.

all nurses in Cochise county register
between October 10 and 17 should not
