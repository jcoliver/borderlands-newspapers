Amounts to $192,000,000 in
Three Months of 1919;
Business Conditions Blame
Government Also Operating
Express Agencies at Loss;
No Raise in Rates Planned
WASHINGTON, May 6. Director
General Hines, In a discussion of re
cent' railroad earnings, tonight dis
closed that:
The government's deficit in op
erating the railroads for the first
three months this year, or the dif
ference between net earnings and
one-fourth of the guaranteed an
nual compensation, was about
$192,000,000 for all roads under
federal management.
The government's loss for 1918
was $226,000,000.
The entire government loss in
curred in fifteen months of fed
eral operation was $418,000,000.
Marked reduction of freight traffic
under records of similar periods of
the last two years were responsible
for the bad financial showing, and
conditions in April, though not yet re
ported fully, show no promise of Im
provement. Despite the big government deficits,
the director general does not contem
plate any general increase in the level
of rates, but prefers to wait restora
tion of normal business conditions.
Deficit in Express Also
The government also Incurred a de
ficit of abou t$14,540,000 in eight
months' operation! of She American
. Railway Express comuany, the Con
solidated Express corporation, up to
March 1, 1919.
"The present unfavorable results
naturally lead to agitation of the ques
tion whether there ought to be an in
crease of rates," said Mr. Hines in his
statement. "My own judgment is that
the present conditions are too abnor
may to serve as a basis for any gen
eral change in the level of rates and
that it is preferable to defer action
on that subject until there shall have
been a fuller opportunity to get a
more reliable and possibly a more nor
mal measure of the conditions, mean
while resorting to every practicable
economy, studying the situation with
the gieatest care, and keeping the'
public- fully informed as to develop
ments. Business Dull, Says Hines
"To a large extent the unafvorable
results for January, February and
March, are due to the fact that busi
ness has fallen off and that expenses
could not be correspondingly re
adjusted so that the loss largely arises'
in connection with the period of re
adjustment through which the country
is going.- Industrial enterprises gen
erally have, suffered embarrasment
on account of the fact that business
has been curtailed so much more
rapidly than expenses could be cur
tailed. The railroad business is prob
ably in its nature less elastic than
any other business and shows more
unfavorably the embarrasments of re
adjustment. ' "The entire railroad organization j
has been and is working most earn-.
estly to readjust these costs to meet
the present conditions, but the nature .
of the railroad business, whether un
der private or public control,' is such
that to a very large extent it is im
possible to offset loss by a correspond
ing reduction in costs. On the other

ANTI-U S.
JAPAN; CALL WILSON KAISER
TOKIO, May 7. (By the Asso
ciated Press.) The anti-American
campaign in the Japanese
press continues with renewed
foce. No serious overt acts have
been committed against Ameri
cans or American property, but
evidence exists that the newspa
per agitation is inciting popular
feeling against America and thus
paving the way to possible open
demonstrations.
Representative Japanese de
prore the press campaign and
have begun to criticize the gov
ernment for Its failure to check
the literary outbursts. '
The participants in a mass
meeting, held Sunday, at which
some anti-American speeches were
delivered, announced their inten
BRITISH BELITTLE
I! S. OCEAN RIGHT
Rival Airmen Derisive Over
Ship Protection Given
American Planes
NEW YORK, May 6. No at
tempt will be made tomorrow by
the United States navy's trans
Atlantic aviators to start on the
first leg of their Journey because
of adverse weather conditions, it
was announced tonight by Com
mander John D. Towers, flight
commander.
ST. JOHNS, N. P., May 6. The
British aviators, Harry Hawker and
Capt. Frederick P. .Raynhani, today
were inclined to belittle the coming
attempt of United States n"avy sea
planes to cross the Atlantic.
Hawker declared he will wager
that any fast steamer leaving New
York on the same day as the "Nan
cies" of the navy will beat them to
England.
The British airmen here appeal
skeptical of the ability of the Liberty
motors to stand the test o fthe long
flight. Capt. Charles W. F. Morgan,
Raynham's navigator, signing himself
"Capt. C. W. F. Morgan, R. A. F., F.
R. G. S.," announced responsibility for
and attached his signature to an arti
cle printed in the St .Johns Daily
Star this afternoon, which asserted
that the American navy's flying boats
would "prove nothing practically or
theoretically."
The article says' in part:
"At no, time during their flight will
the American planes be out of sight of
a ship, as the American navy Is put
ting a ship every 50 miles of the way,
which means that the machines never
will be more than 25 miles from a
ship. This eliminates any risk and
also does away with any need of navi
gation. The Americans might just as
well fly the English channel 50 times,
an ordinary exploit these days. The
flight proves nothing practically . or
theoretically. The personnel guidance
of the pilot does not rule into tne
question as the machine can land at
any time alongside a- ship, rest, $and
proceed. They are also able at any
time to replenish their petrol tanks."
The article adds a reference to the
fact that local Interest, is "all for the
Americans" and says:
"This seems rather unfair, and we
should like to believe it untrue."
Local interest has - turned to the
progress of the United States navy's
flight and St. Johns papers are carry
ing columns from Trepassey bay as
against paragraphs regarding the pro
gress of the Britishers here.

CAMPAIGN SWfiEPti
tion of continuing the demonstra
tions In front of the American
embassy. The police, however,
prevented this step.
The belief is expressed that the
basis for the agitation is fear of
the "growing influence of the
United States in international af
fairs and that it will act as a
curb on Japan's aspirations in
China and Siberia.
After declaring that renewed
attempts for anti-Japanese, legis
lation on the Pacific slope indi
cate that the Americans persecute
Japan In everything, while wear
ing the mask of liberty and fair
ness, the Hicho Shinbun charges
the Americans with having Incit

treaies public and also accuses
American missionaries of foment
ing the Korean insurrection.
Sailor Shoots
Man Who Fails
Tlo Honor Flag
CHICAGO, May . A man who
failed to stand or remove his hat
during the playing of the national
anthem was shot twice by a sailor
guard today after the man had
flourished a revolver among hun
dreds of spectators at Victory, loan
exercises at Victory Forum on
Michigan boulevard. The man, who
gave his name as Joseph Goddard,
53 years old, was taken to the
Bridewell hospital with wounds in
arm and thigh,, and, in addition to
the revolver, was found to have a
knife and a razor.
Goddard had. a seat in the front
row and a sailor Jerked him to his
feet and removed his hat when he
failed to ' honor the anthem. He
then drew a revolver but was taken
from the crowd. When Goddard
tempted to escape, he was shot.
HANDS OFF CHINA
ISV JAPAN POUCY
Would Allow Concession to
No Other Nation in
Kaio-Chau, Shantung
NEW YORK, May 6. Prefacing an
address before the Japan society here
tonight with the declaration that he
waa a "private citizen," and did not
Bpeak "in behalf of the Japanese gov
ernment," Baron Shimpei Goto, for
mer foreign minister of Japan, charac
terized the Kiao-Chau-Shantung situa
tion as "not to be reviewed in the
same light as the Flume question."
"Japan never demanded permanent
occupation of the former German ter
ritory o fKiao-Chau," he said. "She
has repeatedly proclaimed to the
world that she would return it to
China atfer it was unconditionally
given to her at the peace conference.
"In 'the judgment of the Japanese
government it was necessary for Ja
pan to establish an undisputed rignt
over the German territory before she
was in a position to restore it to
China, v In returning Shantung to
China, Japan's policy has been influ
enced by the fear that the Chinese
government may not be able to keep
the province that it may be virtual
ly mortgaged to a third power to the
detriment not only of China but also
of Japan. : .
"In returning Kiao-Chau to China,
Japan will undoubtedly make it plain
that she will never acquiesce in the
cession of that territory to any third
power or in the arbitrary granting of
concessions to foreign nations in the
province of Shantung. I trust that
satisfactory agreement will soon be
made between China and Japan with
a view to preventing such an unfor
tunate development."

Campbell Party to "Larceny"
of State Armory Is Claim as
John Doe Warrants Issued
PHOENIX, May 6. The arrest of
Sergeaa: E. A, Pern, at the Btate ar
mor yor Btorehouse here tonight after
Governor Campbell's forces had oc
cupied that outpost of Adjutant Gen
eral Harris' lines, was the latest de-
! nouement in the war which has raged
between the executive and the mili
tary chief of Arizona since last Jan
uary and which flared up In a series
of marches, counter-marches and
pitched legal battles within the past
24 hours.
Late yesterday the governor sent
Sergeant E. A. , Fern, with a file of
.two men and a letter to Colonel C. W.
Harris, state adjutant general, notify
ing the colonel his connection with the
state service had been cut and order
ing him to turn over bis records fn
the building occupied by his offices a
block from .the state capital. The mil
itary chiefs quarters were locked and
there was no one to receive the letter,
; so the sergeant and his two men re
i tired to advance again this morning.
Today Colonel Harris met the ser
geant for a parley, refused to qujt or
be evicted, told the sergeant, that the
building was under lease to the fed
eral government and Intimated that
the governor could not carry out his
purpose. . - '.
When the sergeant returned later
with a truck - or two - to remove .the
records he met with no better success.
Governor Campbell wired the war
department at Washington for permis
sion to enter the premises and obtain
the records, but up till a late hour to
night no reply had been received.
In the meantime, Colonel Harris
applied for and was granted by Judge
Lyman an order, restraining the gov
ernor from interfering with the adju
tant general's office and- citing the
executive to appear In court next
Thursday to show cause why the or
der should not be made permanent.
Late today Colonel Harris BWore out
warrants charging members of the
John Doe and Richard Doe family
with breaking and entering the prem
ises on Madison street known as the
storehouse or armory with intent to
commit larceny and Sergeant Fern
waa arrested. He was released on
$500 bond.
Colonel Harris .declared there was
much federal property in the store
house and intimated that further de
velopments might be expected follow
ing what he described as the smash
ing of "Captain Temple's one-dollar
lock on the warehouse."
Since January last Governor Camp
bell has refused to approve the adju
tant general's salary and expense ac
counts. While the governor was ab
sent recently in El Paso to welcome
Arizona members of the 158th regi
ment, Acting Governor, Mit Sims ap
proved Colonel Harris' claims and
State Auditor Jesse Boyce issued the
warrants.

RICH SILVER STRIKE
IN PATAGONIA MINE
Word has been received in the
city announcing the strike of a
High grade body of ore in the Flux
mine at Fatagonia. The mine is
owned by Bisbee men and the new
find was struck from the 130 foot
level.
The extent of the ore has not
yet been determined but it is
thought it will be considerable in
quantity and will run as high as
J100 to the ton.
Mining activity in the Patagonia
district is flourishing. It is stated
' that a number of eastern scouts
are now on the ground looking
over properties. The future for
silver and lead looks very promis
ing. The Flux mine is under the
management of F. B. Kohlberg.
U, S. WAR DEPT. SELLS
TWELVE ARMY CAMPS
WASHINGTON, May 6. Approval
of the sale of twelve army camps
eight national guard concentration
sites and four small miscellaneous
camps for a total of more than $548,
000, was announced today by Acting
Secretary of War Crowell.
War department officials showed
satisfatcion over the results, the ma
terial covered by the sale consisting
almost exclusively of hastily con
structed buildlings and some stored
equipment. The government reserved
for its own use the base hospitals and
storage warehouses.
Forty-four" bids were -received from
35 individuals and corporations, the
largest single ' proposal being . from
one large wrecking ' company, ' which
offered to take all the camps for a
price approximating 1540,000. This
proposal was rejected largely because
of the desire of the department to
turji ever to cities' adjacent to certain
camps, the sanitary and other-utilities
which could be used advantageously
for the benefit of their populations.

SHERIFF TO RETURN
WITH ARTENOFF TODAY
After a hard legal fight which lasted j
almost two weeks, it was learned yes
terday that Sheriff McDonald had
succeeded in obtaining permission io
bring M. Artenoff out of the state ot
Massachusetts and that he would ar
rive home with his prisoner some time
today. Artencjff, who is charged with
grand larceny and also is wanted for
questioning in connection with the
mysterious disappearance of his wife
in this section, desperately fought ex:
tradition but apparently to no avail!
Artenoff will undoubtedly face the
original charge of larceny in Judge J..

HOW PEACE MAKERS
BANISH CARE DURING
HOMENTSOF LEISURE
Wilson Goes to the Theater,
Lloyd George Teas, but
"Tiger" Never Stops
PARIS, May 6. How do the
peacemakers relax? How do they
employ their brief moments of
leisure?
Here is a glimpse at the play
time activities of .a few of the
delegates:
LLOYD GEORGE drinks tea
with newspaper men at the Hotel
Majestic and plays golf on the
links In the Bois d Boulogne.
Sometimes he looks in at a dance :
or an improvised concert at Brit'
ish headquarters. Usually he "
dines in the quiet old house he' -occupies,
with a few friends.
PRESIDENT "WILSON visits
the theater occasionally and dines
generally "wlthinis doctor. AcH
julral Grayson and Col. House.
He la usually in bed by 10.
BONAR LAW plays chess
whenever he has idle time.
BALFOUR gives little private
dinner parties, but usually works
late.
HUGHES of Australia is given
to long walks alone about Paris.
LANSING spends much time
reading the French philosopher, -Bergson.
. GENERAL BLISS reads extens
ivelyon the Balkan question, .
Turkey and Africa.
COLONEL . HOUSE devotes':
himself to the reading of politl-'
cal reviews.
CH1NDA, Japanese ambassa
dor, dines with his entourage,
then retires to solitary study of
the peace conference problems.
CLEMEN CEAU. scarcely stops
for meals,. but works all the time..
KRAMARCZ, the Czecho-SIo-vak
.premier, works from 5 a.m.
until midnight.
Venlezlos, Dmowskl of Poland,
Emir Feuael of the Hedjaz are
among the delegates who are fond
of strolling with the crowds in
the Boise de Boulogne mornings.
Few of the delegates find time
for cards, although a v hand of
bridge may .be found somewhere
among them most any day.
And poker seems to be confined
wholly to the less burdened at
taches of the American mission
for the peace delegates are play
ing a bigger game.

TO Y-SCOUT CAMP
The first official visit to the Y-Scout

bering 26. The first detachment, num
bering 14, under the leadership of
Arthur Ojeda, left BIsbee at 6 o'clock
Saturday morning, while the second

ing.
Each scout carried with him suf
ficient food for four meals and upon
their arrival at the camp, which is
situated a mile from the Tombstone
road, a meal was prepared. Saturday
evening was spent in reconnoitering
ana Derore the scouts returned to
camp several discoveries that will be
of importance to the location were
made.
While wandering about in the can
yon a spring was found and it contain
ed such cool water that it was decided
to move camp to the vicinity of the
well. While the boys were in Box
canyon an eagle's nest was seen, ifa.cT
cessible, although from the ground its
size could- be easily judged. The
troupes returned to Bisbee Sunday' aft-
ernoon. Another hike has been plan
ned for next Saturday.
BISBEE BOY WENT OVER
THE TOP THREE TIMES
A letter written by Bernard G.
Hunlck, a Bisbee boy, has just been
received here by A. E. White. In his
letter Hunick states that he has en
listed with the regular army and is
now with the American army of occu
pation In Bascharage, Luxemburg,
Germany. Mr. Hunick was formarly
x attached to the 158th regiment, (Ari
zona's own), but he is now with the
Sixth United States regulars.
' Hunlck went over the top three
times at Verdun, St. Mihiel and the
early Meuse drive of the Americans.
He has been awarded a certificate of
efficiency from the Bureau of Mines
for first aid work performed while a
member of the Wallace McKean hel
met crew attached to the Czar shaft

MEXICO SEIZES U. S. SHIP
WASHINGTON. Mav fi Th Rtnto
depart men t haa been advised from
Vera Cruz that the Mexican court in
that city has ordered the schooner
Cape Horn, an American vessel owned
in Galveston, to be turned over to the

8ISBEEANS FLOCK TO '
' NACO FOR SPORTS OF
CINCO DE MAYO FETE
Liberty day in Mexico was cele
brated in the regular old time way
Monday and the Naco road was the
scene of a continual procession of
automobile traffic, carrying loads of
Bisbeeans back and forth to the
'Cinco de Mayo" fete in Naco.
In order that Americans might in
dulge in the amusements which were
staged on the Mexican side, the imi
tation authorities lifted the ban and
anyone who had secured a temporary
permit from the orficers at Naco
could cross the line. It was estimated
that at least COO1 people from the War
ren District crossed into Mexico.
Notwithstanding the condition that
much of the almost ancient beverage
beer in honest-to-goodness brown
bottles, was in evidence, orderliness
was kept throughout the day and joy
seekers partook of the many amuse
ments in a spirit of jollification.
During Monday several games of
baseball were played betwen local
teams, roping contests were seen and
many lots and buildings were taken up
by dancing parties. During the even
ing dancing appeared to be the most
popular amusement. Although the
Liberty day fete covered fwo days
Sunday and Monday the main cele-
ui anuu uju nut stall, UI1L11 iVlouUuy.
Attempts to cross the line at Doug
las were unsuccessful, imigration of
ficers there saying that nothing in the
way of amusements were being held
in Agua Prieta, consequently many
persons from Douglas made the trip to
Naco and enjoyed themselves there.
A lively celebration was held, also in
Nogales.
Rumors were current Monday that
an old-time bull fight would be ised
idUring the afternoon, and although
sohfe arrangements had been nade,
the bout was not allowed to be pulled
off. "

No announcement In : the musical
history of Bisbee is of greater mo

Beach Yaw, the gifted American so
prano, who accompanied by Miss
Georgiella Lay, is coming to the Grand
theater next Thursday night. May 8.
Possessing a most marvelous voice
and a personality of rare charm Miss
Yaw has . been described, "The Cali
fornia Skylark" and those who have
heard her feel sure that the compari
son at her voice with that of the feath
ered tribe is not out of place.
A prominent musical critic speaks
of her as follows:
"The mad scene from Hamlet, given
In costume, held the Intense interest
of the audience as much by her strong
protrayal of Ophelia as by her won
derful gift of song. "The Skylark,"
written by Miss Yaw herself, Is sup
posed to imitate the lark in its flight.
In listening to the dulcet tones, one
can readily visualize the bird as it
leaves its nest on the ground and
mark Its progress as It soars Into the
vaulted blue.
It was a wonderful bit of vocaliz
ing and the audience was quick to ap
preciate its beauty and charm." Adv.
DALLAS, Tex., May ..'In a little
white cottage surroundeo. by a flower
dotted lawn where the air is filled
with the perfume of locust arid hon
eysuckle, there lives, between Dallas
and Forth Worth a little war widow
and her baby, whose story is perhaps
the strangest, the tenderest and the
saddest inall Texas. For, in less than
a year, a man and women met, wed
and parted forever, bringing into the
world as a result of the union, a little
one who will never know save through
tradition that is painted with glory.
The mother is Mrs. Jeannette Wis
dom, until recently of Houston; the
father was Pierce Wisdom of Texar
kan, and the baby Is Pierce, Jr.
Early in the war Pierce Wisdom,
although 35, which you remember, was
at that time beyond draft age, volun
teered as a private and went to Hous
ton to enter a training camp. His sis
ter had a close friendj Jenatte San
der, who lived in Houston Heights. In
Ocjober, 1917, upon his sister's re
quest, he hunted up the friend, whom
he had never seen and established an
acquaintance which, in the next three
months,- developed into love.
The couple married in February.
In May the husband went to France.
In November he made the great sac
rifice in the battle of Argonne, and
in January little Pierce was born.
"The family . didn't let me know
when the news of his death came,"
Mrs. Wisdom says. "BuT now, look
ing back, I can recall so vividly the
night they got the official notice. I
was in the pantry when the door bell
rang, a little sharply. I started to an
swer, but isn't it strange what trivial
things at supreme momonts, some
times change one's actions! I stop
ped to stir some soup that was cook
ing on the stove. I even remember
distinctly fiow firmly I grasped the
spoon.
" "By the time I was through the
messenger was gone. When I asked
my family who.lt was they evaded the
question, and I forgot the incident.
But I noticed that I was the only one
who ate any supper that night I was
a little worried .because they all' sat
about so strangely silent and depress
ed. But mother said she wasn't feel
ing well and sister had a headache
and father said he was too tired to
eat. And so I, who was the center of
the tragedy, all unknowing, enoyed
the meal while the rest of them griev
ed for my sake.
"I didn't notice, during the next few,
days, how carefully they guarded the
mail and papers, so that I wouldn't
learn the truth. But somehow I think
our loved ones in the other world are
nearer to us than we realize.
"For, when the baby came, before
the ether had worn off, I saw, not the
narrow panes, but a battle scene with
a man my husband as the central
figure. -
"He had a gash across is forehead
and blood streaming down his cheek,
and he was always stumbling stumb
ling and falling forward.
"When" I became conscious again I
kept wondering if it were a dream or
a reality. The nights were horrible.
But in the daytime, when the sun was
out, I still had hope. It was a week
before I knew.J'
Mrs. Wisdom Is small. "I came just
to the shoulder of my husband," she
says. Her eyes are big and gray and
wistful. s Her hair and cheeks are fair,
her vclce i3 soft and her manner gen
tie. She holds her baby close to her
mother heart and says:
'"I'm .glad to know I've been a part.
however small, in this great war, even
though it brought sorrow to'me, and
sorrow to my husband. Sacrifice ex
alts. And my baby, my little Pierce,
can always be. proud to know the story
of his father. That is why I'm glad
that he's a boy, for these things mean
more to men than women."
Mrs. Wisdom, in spite of what she
has already kiven to war, is still a
patriot, and is trying to continue the
work her husband so nobly began. For,
with the money she has so far receiv
ed in insurance because of his death,
she is buying Victory Bonds for their
little son.

Slighting the Warren District
We do not believe that the board of supervisors acted with malice to
ward the Warren district when they named Monday night five members of
a county higahway 'commission, giving this district only one representa
tive on the commission. We do not believe the board intended to slight
this district. We do not infer that the board delliberately attempted to
discriminate against this community. The board has not been conducted .
in this manner in the past.
Nevertheless, the Warren district suffered through the board's over
sight when the new commission was named. Five members will com
pose the commission. Two of these members are from Douglas, one is
from Pearce, one is from Willcox and the fifth is from'Lowell.
We would not infer that the beard favored Douglas with the inten
tion of disfavoring the Warren district. We would refrain from suggest
ing that the board sought purposely to outweigh this district in repre
sentation on the new commission, and that Douglas profiteered thereby..
We do not believe that Douglas was given two commissioners and the
Warren district one, just because the Warren district has requested so
little in the form of new highways and Douslas has demanded so much.
We do believe the beard could be so corrupt el or influenced by out3ide
pressure.
Nevertheless, the fact remains that the Warren District pays two
thirds of the county taxes. Douglas pays much less than one-third of
the county taxes. The money -which it is proposed the new commission
shall expend will come two-thirds from the Warren District and one-third
from the remainder of the county, including Douglas. And Douglas gets
two-fifths "of the, voice of the new commission, as compared with tile War
ren District's one-fifth voice.
When moneys are raised in this county through bond issues, the War
ren District, the wealthiest community in the county and by far the
largest in pcint' 06 population, subscribes to two-thirds of the moneys.
When these funds are expended, the Warren District gladly sees much of
the money raised in its boundaries, devoted to improvements in other
parts of the county. The' Warren District will not object to a share of its
pro-rata of the proposed bond issue going to other districts, but the War
ren District would appreciate a voice in the expenditure of the funds in
proportion to the assessment of the funds. The Warren District is not
opposed to highway improvements, but the Warren District is opposed
to highway improvements which are constructed at the expense of the
district for the purpose of injuring the district.
As a point of illustration, the Warren District would object strenu
ously io the building cf the proposed highway from Pearce eastward with
taxes or bond funds largely subscibed in the Warren District, for Urn
highway has a its object the destruction, of the Want u District -i Bor
derland route. As a further illustration, the Warren District will strenu
ously eppose s-ny attempt to divert or desttoy the Gleoscn-Korest Ranch
highway, whkr, will be th!s district's or.l outlc to the eas; and which
this district has requested from the proposed bond issue.
We do not believe that the board named the highway commission
especially with the object of accomplishing either of these suggested
plans. We would not infer that the board had any sinister or ulterior
motive in their obviously unintentional slight of the Warren District.
We wculd hate to believe that members of the board would stoop to such
methods. '
We believe that the board is eminently fair, and wishes to treat each
district in the county fairly. And we believe that, since this omission has
been called to the attention of the board, steps will immediately be takpn
by the board to correct the error.
Certainly the people of. the Warren District believe the board will
give them the "square.deal" promised. Until the board demonstrates
its enmity to the district, we will continue to believe their slight of che
district was unintentional; we would hate to believe otherwise. But the
next move is entirely up to the board. The burden of proof rests with
them. Unless they demonstrate their willingness to give this district
proper representation, unless they grant this district its few highway
requests, the district will alter its opinion of the board. We would hate
to suggest what that altered opinion might become, or to what ends it
might be directed. We will leave this also with the board.

Beauty A By-Product to Use
All of us expect tobuild a home sometime.
It is a good deal like the chicken business we have all either bei
r expect to go into it.
A good many of us will build this year. All of us should that can,
as a public spirited contribution to prosperity if for no other reason.
The average dwelling is a good deal more complicated than the a-, cr
age commercial structure, even though the cost is less. v
There is more detail that requires thinking out and its use is more
personal, intimate, than the commercial structure.
And a good deal of the thought is up to the owner; for architects
have a -way of saying that a building can't be built any better thai the
intelligence of the man who pays for it; that a gcod deal of the effort
of r-n architect is expended in keeping the owner from doing things that
he should not do.
John Ruskin said that a beautiful thin gin the way of a house or bit
of furniture need be no more expensive than one that is ugly, that the
same amount of labor or material is involved in both, and that it is all a
question of thought in order to intelligently direct the labor.
A group of ycung Chicago architects say that construction should be
resigned from inside out, that use should be the first consideration, and
that the beauty and harmony of line would follow naturally.
A group of young Chicago architects say that construction should be
decorated, but decoration should not be constructed.
They also say that the lines, form or design of a building, should fol
lew its function, use or purpose.'
This last theory is confirmed by the fact that very often an object i.-J
must beautiful which is not intended to bo beautifulwhere no thought
Is given its beauty.
A full-rigged schooner, for instance, is not designed as a thing of
beauty, yet few objects are more beautiful.
This theory also has example in nature itself:
Nature does nothing for show, yet it is all show.
If we pledge ourselves to aid Prance in case of future attack, we
may not have it to do. If we don't pledge ourselves, we may have to
repeat our late experience. A bull dog seldom attacks intruders. If the
dug is there, they don't intrudo.
Ifeinie 'doubtless lias moments when ho would like to break a brick
over the head of the chap who started the super-man talk.
A republic is a form of government under which one party takes the
cussing and the other does it. . , ' .
Taking what belongs o another is stealing. Comniunisiu is organ
ized stealing with benefit of clergy.
The length of the skirt depends largely on the shape of the ankles.
PHOENIX. May 6. Upwards of
5000 persons led by veterans of the
15Sth infantry, who arrived only last
night from the war zone, marched in a
great Victory Liberty loan parade
here tonight. '
Besides hundreds of - returned sol
diers, the great demonstration for the
loan included in its ranks all the
school children of the city above the
fifth grade, high school cadets, frh..
ternal organizations, women's so
cieties, many foreign born Americans,
half a dozen bands and numerous
decorated floats. Following the pa
rade, groups assembled in all parts
of the business section in an intensi
fied drive to put the Phoenix quota
for the Victory Liberty loan over the
top, 'and at a late hour tonight the
purveyors of the patriotic bonds still
were doing a rushing business.

Mesa Votes on Bonds
MESA, May 6. At a specially called
meeting of the Mesa city council, it
was decided to call an elec:ion for the
purpose of deciding whether bonds in
the sum of $100,000 should be sold for
the purpose of financing various city
improvements. "irst and foremost
ccmes a needed expenditure of $60,000
for the enlargement of the gas plant,
additional electrical equipment and
power and extension and improvement
cf the water sys;em. As explained by
Mayor Kleinman, this" is not an ex
pense, but an investment by which ad
ditional revenue will come inti the
city, just as a merchant buys a lar.se j
stock cf gcods. It is a fact that must
be faced, that, neit winter, the town
will be short on gas, for the simple j
reascn that Mesa has outgrown its
present plant.
of Tucson went jupou record as a
booster to the limit of the Fifth Liber

RE-flPPREBED
. After making his escape from a Bis-
bee hospital and eluding the police
for several weeks, Thoma3 Densmore,
also known to the police as J. W.
Johnson and "Mr. Scott," Monday
night crossed the international bound
ary at Naco, Sonora, according to the
police, and walked into the arms of
Deputy Sheriff Tom Foster, who was
waiting for him. Shortly after Dens
more had been taken prisoner Mrs.
Carl Richardson, alias. Mrs. J. V. John
son, was taken into custody by county
officer at a rooming house in Lo
well and lodged in the Lowell jail.
A few feet away from the cell oc
cupied by Mrs. Richardson, Densmore
sat on an improvised cot and buried
his head in his hands. Three week3
ago he had been found by the police in
a weakened condition bleeding pro
fusely from a serious .wound in the
back inflicted by a razor. Last niht
the wound had healed considerably.
When the police discovered the pris
oner shortly after he had been cut a
few. weeks ago, Densmore related a
story, they say, to the effect that he
had been held up by two men, one a
Mexican and the . other an American
and that the American held him while
the Mexican cut him. Mrs. Ricnard
son, however, related a different story,
according to the officers. She insisted
that the wound was the result of a
accident. The two different stories led
the police to believe that other mo
. tives were responsible for the cutting
and an investigation was conducted
which resulted in the finding of a
blood-stained razor on the top of the
kitchenette in the apartments oc
cupied by Mrs. Richardson. She was
placed under arrest and charged with
an assault with a deadly weapon with
attempt to kill. Densmore, under be
lief that he was going to die, is said
later to have told the police that his
story was untrue.
, In 'the meantime Mrs. Richardson
had been placed in the Bisbee jail and
a preliminary hearing was to be held
as soon as Densmore was in condi
tion to appear in court. A few days
later however, a call at the hospital re
vealed that Densmore had fled during
the early hours of the morning. Aft
er a dilieent search for the prisoner
the court released Mrs. Richardson
from jail on account of the absence
o fthe material witness.
Densmore is now alleged to have
had a friend, a jitney bus driver, bring
him some clotlies and after dressing
himself walked out of the hospital Into
a waiting automobile. From the Cop
per Queen hospital the car swung
toward the Huachuca mountains and
then doubled back to the Louis
Sprints rancli where the wounus of
Densmore-were' dressed and where he!
remained for several days, it is said.
A few days ago it was learned, ac
cording to the police, that Densmore
made a trip from Louis Springs into
Bisbee and at the time it is alleged
that he walked the streets ia perfect
freedom. Leaving Bisbee he crossed
the international boundry at N'acc,
Ariz., under the name of Scott. While
in Naco, Sonora, he made his lodging
with a Chinese restaurant keeper. On
tfie eve of the Cinco de Mayo celebra
tion Densmore was a conspicuous fig
ure on the Mexican streets and as
sumed the role of an official bureau
of information for visiting American
joy seekers. .
Densmore and Mrs. Richardson have
had charges preferred against them
by the court of Judge Winters at Lo
well. It is probable, according to tha
court, that the old charge against
Mrs. Richardson charging her "with
an assault wiih a deadly weapon with
attempt to kill" will be brought up
at the preliminary hearing which is
scheduled ror some time today.

HAND PEACE TREATY
TO GERMANS TODAY

ed the provisions of the document
and was questioned from time to time,
the explanations given being full and
tree.
(By the Associated Press.)
AH is in readiness lor the presen
tation. Wednesday afternoon of the
peace treaty to the German delegates.
The various powers, have been appris
ed of the contents of the momentous
document and all that remains is to
cali the German delegates before the
peace congress at Versailles and hand
to them the trea.y.
The terms admittedly will be hard
for Germany, but it is asserted that
there is but cne road for her to follow
if she is to obtain the.recurn of peace
and the chance to rehabilitate herself
economically. Acquiescence must be
made to a demand for a trial of her
former imperial master, which is un
derstood to have been incorporated in
tie treaty. Reports say a continu
ance of the present isolation of the
country is being considered if Ger
many should decline to affix her signa
ture to the treaty.
There is still dissent among the al
lied1 and associated powers over some
provisions of the treaty. Chief among
the objectors is Italy, with Fiume and
Dalmation coast the point in dispute.
Italy s chiet delegates to the peace
conference did not visit Versailles
Tuesday afternoon when the treaty
was read to the smaller powers, but
are expected to be present Wednesday.
Their-credentials already have been
handed to the Germans.
The Italians were represented at
the session Tuesday by Signor Crespi,
who made reservations concerning any
provisions of the peace treaty which
are not acceptable to Italy.
The Chinese delegates have reiter
ated their protest concerning the dis
position of Kiao-Chau, and Portugal
expressed dissatisfaction against the
treatment accorded the republic.
Marshal Foch also has expressed
opposition to the treaty as it stands
and dcirared it to be his private opin
ion that, it should not be signed, a-
the military security given France is
inadequate.
Nevertheless, the treaty as formu
luted is to he placed in '.he hands ol
;h: (; riiians. acio:ding to the last ro

VICTORY LOAN STILL
LAGGING HERE; HEROIC
FINAL EFFORT NEEDED
With Victory day passing locally
without any noticeable increased ac
tivity, it is nevertheless thought that
when returns are all in from the va
rious precincts the amount will pass
the $000,000 mark. Chairman Gaines
yesterday afternoon had received
only a few reports and those from the
mines, but he had hopes of increased
subscriptions as a result of the gov
ernor's proclamation,
During the forenoon large crowds
were on the downtown streets but
later in the afternoon the streets were
practically deserted a majority of the
people having motored down to War
ren and other points of interest about
the city.
Additional leports received during
the day showed that the Holbrook day
shift force had added $300 to be placed
on the $2300 previously reported.
Sacramento hill made its first re
port to central headquarters through
Mr. J. F. Matthews. The amount sub
scribed on the hill totaled $400, but it
was said a lot of work yet remained
to be done.
Inasmuch as next Saturday is the
closing day of the drive and with
nearly $500,000 yet to be raised, Mr.
Gaines points out that the situation is
really alarming and without the indi
vidual efforts of everyone in the com
munity Bisbee is not going to reach it3
quota by a good many thousands of
dollars.
It is highly probable now that the
last two days of the drive will be de
voted to a free-for-all effort as a last
struggle to put the loan over the top.
Everyone who does not wear the ic
tory button will be approached by
workers- and no one will be immune.
According to a telephone message
from Douglas yesterday afternoon to
Chairman Gaines at local headquarters
Douglas dragged along very slowly
during the morning but took a firm
brace after lunch and at 2 o clock
more than $100,000 had been reported
with a number of districts yet to be
leard from.

HUNS CAUSE OF RIGID
BELGIUM CENSORSHIP
BRUSSELS, May 6. Belgium has
the most rigid postal censorship that
remains since the war. The reason?
So many Germans in Belgium and so
many spies among them. It takes
about a month for letcers to pass
through the censorship. Though tlie
German army of occupation is gone,
there are thousands of Germans re
maining, many of whom to escape
deportation. Three train loads a day
are being ent out through Holland,
as military restrictions prevent direct
deportation.
BELGIUM TO ENLARGE
ITS MERCHANT FLEET
BRUSSELS, May 6. Belgium is to
have a merchant marine. The allies
have promised this. It will be greater
than the Belgian fleet before the
war. Sixty ships with . a total ton
nage of 300,000 have been promised.
This was the tonnage of the Belgium
fleet before the war. Nearly half of
the ships then owned were lost. The
new fleet will therefore have a ton
nage of 500,000. Work has begun on
restoring the port of Antwerp.

'TOO FAT TO FIGHT,'
REX BEACH DRAMA
OF WARWORK, HERE
Famous Author's Newest Motion Pic
ture, Made From New Magazine
Story, Has Frank Mclntyre
in Leading Role
Nation-wide and international is the
popularity of Rex Beach. With each
succeeding picturlzation of his famous
stories he becomes not better known,
but more beloved by the red-blooded
races of the world. His "Too Fat to
Fight," produced for Goldwyn and
featuring Frank Mclntyre, promises
all that the Rex Beach pictures have
offered in the past, with the addition
of a distinct surprise.
"Too Fat to Fight" is a patriotic
drama with a purpose and a big punch.
It is unlike anything with which
screen devotees have ever associated
the name of Rex Beach, yet it embod
ies all the vigor, imagination and
frank openheartedness of the great
dramas of the American author.
Rex Beach's choice of Frank Mc
lntyre to play the featured role in his
new play will be hailed with delight by
all who know this unctuous comedian.
Star of the stage of the screen, Frank
Mclntyre is as well known on Broad
way as he is in vaudeville through-,
out the union. He is a favorite of the
people and his work in "Too Fat to
Fight," rich with opportunities for fun
making and appealing pathos, prom
ises once again to emphasize the im
portance of Rex Beach's supervision
in producing his pictures. Adv.

' NEW ORK, May 6. No markets
today holiday.
THE GRAIN MARKETS
CHICAGO, May 6. With hogs jump
ing today to the highest price ever
known, $21.35 a hundred pounds, the
corn marke; ran up sharply, despite a
widely prevalent opinion that an im
partan address which the national
wheat director, Julius H. Barnes, de
livered to the member of the board of
trade here, would have a bearish ef
fect. Corn closed strong, 3JAc to 4V4c
net higher with July $1.69 Vt to $1. 691,2
and September $1.63 ' to $1.6376c.
Oats finished unchanged to c lower.
The outcome in provisions was an ad
Vance ranging from 24 to 50c.
Breaking of high price records in
the hog market had already come in
good earnest before the opening
trades were made in the corn pit. The
reason for the upward flight of hog
values was that the total number of
hogs received at the Chicago yards
today was much smaller than had
been expected and supplies also were
reported scanty at other yestern pack
ing centers. Unfavorable weather
for plowing, planting and hauling corn

FORMER SMELTERM AH
IN DOUBLE SHOOTING
Charles Dahlquist, a former em
ploye of the Calumet and Arizona
company's smelter and known in Bis
bee, shot and killed his wife and then
committed suicide at the Gordon
apartments, 325 East San Antonio
street. El Paso, Texas, last Saturday
night, according to Coroner A. J. Hall.
A sister who was in the next room
at the time, said she heard the couple
quarreling, but as they often engaged
in little spats, she did not attach much
significance to it. Presently the sis
ter heard a shot, closely followed by
another, she said. She rushed into
the street and summoned the police
officers, who entered the room and
found the husband and wife lying dead
on the bea. -
Dahlquist, it is said, had not been
working for about two months and
had not completely recovered from an
attack of influenza. He worked for
the electric light company in Douglas.
The bodies are now at an undertaking
parlor in El Paso. Several relatives
were in El Paso at the time of the
tragedy.
Coroner Hall stated it was plainly a
case of Dahlquist's killing his wife
and then taking his own life.

Community Health Good
puring the month of April the
health of the community was generally
good. Influenza cases show a de
crease and the quarantine was or
dered lifted by the health committee
and the council. Sixteen cases of
measles were reported for the month1,
and 16 deaths resulting from sundry
causes. Of the deaths eight were
adults and eight were children. The
males showed a majority in the death
list with a total of 12.
The report of the fire chief showed
that the department had answered five
alarms during the month, all fro
small fires excepting the Phelps Dodge
fire, the total loss of which has not
yet been announced by the adjusters.

TO ENLARGE NACO CAMP.
It was learned ' yesterday that pre
parations are being made by the gov
ernment to considerably enlarge the
present army camp at Naco. Although
full details at present are lacking it
was said that as many as 16 new build
ings will be erected and the general
camp site be improved. The reason
for this is because a larger military
force is to be maintained at Naco as
it is considered an ideal training camp.
It is expected that when the work be

for laborers and men with trades.

PROPOSED ROADS BIG
COCHISE ASSET SAYS
SUPERVISOR ROBERTS
Cochise county will have the best
roads in the state if the proposed
county highway bond issue carries, ac
cording to Supervisor Charles M.
Roberts of Willcox, in a statement
made yesterday during a bTiness
visit to Bisbee.
"If we are fortunate enough to have
the Bankhead National Hiehway
routed through Cochise county it will
be one of the best assets we ran lay
claim to, for almost the entire cross
country automobile traffic will take
advantages of the highway and in so
doing tourists will have to trade along
the route, thereby bringing business
here," said Mr. Roberts.
"This is the first bond issues I
have ever voted for, and it is because
I consider the jssue of the utmost im
portance to the welfare of the county,'
that 1 voted for it. Cochise county
county was sadly lagging behind other
counties in the state in good roads
notwithstanding the fact that this
county is the richest in the state.
However, I believe that when we have
spent this present money for county
road improvements Cochise will have
the best roads in the state.
"We were asked by the Bankhead
highway committee t we contemplat
ed spending any money for road im
provements and we told them what
we were doing and going to do. and
now we have promised it is up to us
to build the roads. I am not saying
that we are positively sure that the
national highway will go through this
county, but I will say that it looks
highly favorable for us.
"This county will never miss the
money expended on good roads, for
whether we get the national highway
or not .travelers, will pass through
here to see the country, bearing in
mind that the roads are in good con
dition, and considering thisv the busi
ness in the district will consequently
be that much enrichei'J. .Ve have
scenery in this countytha t is uncom
parable by any other in the state, and
unless we get busy and build good
roads to gain access to this scenery
and moutanins we will miss one of
the greatest advantages we have."
The board of , supervisors have call
ed a meeting with the highway com
mission to meet in Tombstone tomor
row to discuss a few points in their
plans. A full report as to estimates,
definite ' routes, etc., will not be
brought up until ten days from now.
