At Least 50 of Those Taken

For Deportation; Eight Wo
men included in Big Haul
NEW YORK, Nov. 7. A nation
wide raid on anarchists began here
tonight. Agents of the department
of justice, led by Wm. J. Flynn, ar
rested mare than 200 radicals assem
bled in the headquarters of the Rus
sian soviet republic, and after they
had been taken to headquarters of
the department of justice and cross
examined, fifty nere held for depor
tation as undesirable citizens.
Eight women were taken in the
raid, of whom two were held for de
portation. While the men were being exam
ined reports were received of other
raids which were made on radicals
at Philadelphia, Detroit, Newark,
Jackson, Mich., Waterbury, Conn.,
Chicago and 6ther places.
It was learned that 3G warrants
had been issued by Commissioner
General of Immigration Caminetti for
radicals known to have been particu
larly active in the industrial unrest
of the country. It was reported that
these perrons who were particularly
sought had been caught. They were
taken to police headquarters.
The raids, taking plate on the eve
of widely advertised celebrations of
the second anniversary of the estab
lishment of the soviet government in
Russia, were said to have nipped in
the bud a country-wide plot openly
to defy governmental authority. This
has been advocated, it was said, for
several weeks by combined radical
elements, the I. W. W., anarchists
and Russian agitators. Pamphlets
and other liierature to this effect are
now in possession of the department
cf justice, it was said. Heavy boxes
filled with inflammatory literature
seized at soviet headquarters were
brought to Chief Flynn" s office. Doz
ens of brief cases containing type
written and printed literature also
were amonz the seized property. The
raid was the third made upon the
Manhattan headquarters this year.
DETROIT, Nov. 7. Department of
justice agents here tonight, rein
forced by officers from several other
cities, took into custody fifty alleged
radical agitators. Twenty men were
arrested in a hall used for anarchis
tic meetings and others were round
ed up at their homes. AH wVre being
held for further investigation.
Three officers under Arthur L.
Barkey conducted the raid on the
hall where a meeting attended by
about 200 persons was in progress.
There was little violence. In the
confusion all but twenty escaped
from the building.
A number of those arretsed, ac
cording to the officers, have been
preaching "direct action" and advo
cating a soviet government for this
countrv in local halls for weeks.

Pan Motor Co. Is
Accused of Hiring
Girl Detective to
Follow the Jurors

poenas for John Jones and Fred R
Lynch, manager and assistant man
ager of a detective agency; Attorney
John L. Hopkins, counsel for some of
the deefndants in the Pan Motors
conspiracy trial, and Mrs. Ruth Ham
brock. The subpoenas were issued
after Miss Florence Schoenbeck, a
private detective employed by the
agency, was said to have admitted
she had been employed the last week
to follow the jurors.
The incident occurred at a night
session of another case, the Pan Mo
tor trial having been adjourned late
in the day after the prosecution had
rested its case after two weeks of
introduction of evidence. Miss
Miss Schoenbeck, under questioning
by the judge, explained that she had
been employed to watch the jurors
after they left the federal building.
She said sometimes Mrs. Hambrock,
a friend, accompanied her in shad
owing the jurors.
Mr. Lynch appeared later and said
that the agency had been employed
by Attorney Hopkins.
The last witness was Wesley Ben

Complete official and unofficial re

If the missing seven precincts give

Answer to Protests of U. S.
That Troops Were Not Co
operating With Allies Fully
Explains Attitude of Japs
TOKIO, Sunday, Nov. 2. (By The
Associated Press.) The Japanese
government in its reply just forward
ed to Washington to the American (
note of last September, complaining
of a lack of co-operation of Japanese i
troops in the operation of the trans
Siberian railroad, draws a sharp dis
tinction between the military protec
tion o fthe railroad, which it is will
ing to undertake, and obedience to
the orders and instructions of the inter-allied
railway commission under
John . W. Stevens, or the subsidiary
railroad board, which is in no wise
contemplated.
The correspondent of The Associ
ated Press finds that the note, which
is moderate In tone and which as a
diplomatic document bears evidence
of the exceeding care expended upon
its composition, declares tnai no In
formation in the possession or Japan
bears out the contention in the note
of the American government that
Japanese troops flatly refused to pro
tect lives or property of allied rail
road inspectors in the territory con
trolled by the Cossack commander,
Semenoff. The note expresses the
opinion that the American contention
is based upon some misunderstanding
and suggests that the American gov
ernment bring forward any concrete
facts upon which it bases its case. In
this event the Japanese government
would be glad to ' furnish ' material
which might explain the Japanese
side of the case.
"It is a matter of no small regret
that information in the possession of
the United States in regard to mi
understandings and differences of this
kind between nationals of theUnited
States and Japan in Siberia seems at
variance with information reaching
the Japanese government," the note
observes.
The government wishes especially
to emphasize the fact that the pri
mary duty of the military is the de
fense of the railwav itself, believine
j that this is vital If the railway is to
J be operated at all. It is thought, too. j
; luai. iue government or tne united
State3 will recognize the great efforts
i and sacrifices made by the Japanese
troops in defense of the railway.
If, however, it is declared in the
note, the American government
thinks that the allied military forces
should be made subor(rrnae mt the
inter-allied commission or to the sub
sidiary technical board, the Japanese
government regrets to say that it is
unable to fall in line with that atti
tude. Apparently desirous that the7
foregoing statement should not cause'
fresh misunderstandings, the note
continues:
"However, the Japanese govern
ment would in no case insist that

WASHINGTON, Novj7. The first
affirmative step to qualification of
the peace treaty was taken toda'y by
the senate after administration lead
ers, with the backing of President
Wilson, had reaffirmed their inten
tion of voting against ratification if
the reservations drawn by the sen
ate majority are adopted.
The initial test of strength on the
reservation program of the foreign
relations committee found the Repub
licans almost solidly united behind it,
the group of mild reservationists who
helped kill the committee's amend
ments and the irreconcilable group
of treaty fees standing together, for
the first time since the long treaty
fight began.
By a vote of 48 to 40 the senate
approved, after- all efforts to amend
it had failed, the committee's pream
ple to the reservation group, requir
ing lhat to make the treaty binding
at least three of the lour great pow
ers must accept the senate qualifi
cations. The only Republican who
did not swing into line for the pro
posal was Senator McCumber of
North Dakota, while three Demo
crats, Senators Reed, Missouri; Gore,
Oklahoma, and Wateh, Massachu
setts voted with- the majority.
When adjournment was reached,
the first of the 14 reservations was
under debate, and Republican leaders
were claiming that they had safe
majorities pledged for the entire
group. The mild reservationists, it
was declared, had turned down a
new Democratic offer of compromise,
while the irreconcilable wing was de
vising a plan of acticn by which they
hoped to "defeat the treaty entirely.
The best claim made by the adminis
tration forces was that the treaty
would be wedged into a deadlock
which in the end would make a com
promise inevitable.
The plan to vote against the treaty
and thus deadlock the ratification
fight was declared to have President
Wilson's unqualified support

SAINIEGO TO
ARRAN6E PEACE
WITH INDIANS
Retired General Will Make all
Terms With Warring Ya
quis Without Military Es
cort; Says They Trust Him
DOUGLAS, Nov. 7 Acting upon the
personal sanction of Adolfo de la
Huerta, governor of Sonora, and bj
request of the Broncho, or wild sec
tion, of the Yaqui Indian tribe, that
he act as intermediary to arrange
terms of peace, General Miguel S.
Samariego, retired, left Agua Prieta
today for Nacozari and the south to
meet the Indian chiefs. Before his
departure General Samaniego, in con
versation with friends, said he had re
fused to take any military escort, al
though Governor de la Huerta had in
sisted upon sending a large body of
soldiers with him. "The Indians like
and trust me, and I feel the greatest
good will toward them. I shall be
safer without an escort than with
one," he is quoted as saying. The
exact meeting place will be arranged
by the general upon his arrival in'
towns to the south. It is understood
to be his intention to send messen
gers from Moctezuma to the various
chiefs of Yaqui factions to arrange
a date and place of meeting.
Following his recent defeat in the
pubemational campaign in Sonora,
General Samaniego retired to his
ranch near Bavispe, in the eastern
part of the state. Two weeks ago he
received messages stating that a
large party of Yaquis were northward
bound and wished to confer with him
about terms of peace wrtn tne state
government. Samaniego refused to
meet the Indians, sending back word
that he was a private citizen and his
word would not be binding upon the
state. However, he notified Governor
de la Huerta of the message, and was
iummoned by the governor to come
to the state capital at Hermosillo, for
a conference. He refused to go any
further toward the capital than Agua
Prieta, opposite Douglas, Ariz., and
all day Thursday was in conference
with the governor by telegraph.
General Samaniego rerusecr to
undertake the mission until assured
by the governor that he would use his
influence to the utmost to obtain the
sanction of the state congress to such
terms as the general might arrange
with the Indians. Armed with this
authority, h,e accepted the mission.

Starts Campaign
To Place Lowden
Presidential Chair
SPRINGFIELD, 111., Nov. 7. In a
keynote speech tonight, launching the
candidacy of Governor Frank O. Low
den of Illinois for the. presidency of
the United States, congressman Wil
liam A. Rodenburg of East St. Louis
presented the name of Governor Cal
vin Coolidge of Massachusetts of
a running mate for Lowden, at a
meeting of the Illinois Republican
Editorial association. The mention
cf Governor Coolidge's name brought
a storm of applause.
Significance was attached to the
linking of the two names because of
the fact that Congressman Rodenburg
has been picked to make the Lowden
nominating speech on the floor of the
national convention.
Governor Lowden was given an ova
tion when he referred to Congressman
Rodenburg as "the nation's next
choice."
Preceding the Rodenburg address,
Governor Lowden spoke briefly. He
thanked the editors for their support
during. the crucial days of the war,
and declared the responsibility of the
press was limitless in the days of re
construction. He paid tribute to the
history of the Republican party, but
did not discuss issues.
Will H. Hays, chairman of the Re
publican national committee, was
present, and spoke, but confined his
remarks to national affairs. He did
not touch candidacies.

when the labor delegates were put

told the delegates that he occupied
"the most unique position of any of

reason that "I am without power or

Mr. Marshall stated that he did not

Jand applause, "I .preside over the

"But I do have some Idea as to how

Federation Head Leaves Of
fice of Attorney General in
Dispirited Mood, Refusing
Talk to Any Newspapermen
WASHINGTON. Nov. 7. Eleventh
hour efforts by Samuel Gompers to
settle the coal strike were met to
night by emphatic declaration from
the government that injunction pro
ceedings would be dismissed the in
stant the strike order was withdrawn
and not before.
This final decision was given to
Mr. Gompers, heading a delegation of
high labor officials, at the close of
the third conference of the day with
Attorney General Palmer and arter
Mr. Gompers. had talked over the.
telephone with John L. Lewis, acting
head of the United Mine Workers of
America, at Indianapolis.
Mr. Gompers, fighting hard to have
the government drop its injunction
suit set for hearing tomorrow, plain
ly showed that he was under a ner
vous strain as he left the depart
ment of justice, flatly and bluntly
refusing on his way out to say one
word about the three conferences or
hope of ending the strike of more
than 400,000 miners before the Unit
ed States could press its suit against
officers of the miners' organization.
Attorney General Palmer, to whom
Mr. Gompers referred all requests for
information, refused to see newspa
per men.
"Mr. Palmer wishes me to say that
he will have no statement tonight
other than he made as he left the
cabinet meeting," his secretary an
nounced. ' There were only 18 words in the
statement Mr. Pawner dictated to the
newspaper men as he left the White
House after the cabinet meeting and
and earlier conference with President
Wilson.
"The injunction proceedings against
the coal miners' leaders will be dis
missed the instant the strike order
is recalled." said the attorney gen
eral, and his utterance stood touight
as the final word from the govern
ment on the eve of what may prove
the beginning tomorrow of one of the
greatest labor union litigation in the
history of the country
Through the day, although it was
on the lip of all official Washington
that the government and the miners
were considering new plans for end
ing the struggle, without further re
sort to law, the feeling grew that
hearings on the restraining order,
set for tomorrow morning in the
federal court before Judge Anderson
at Indianapolis, would be postponed
"without prejudice to either side."
The department of Justice will not
ask for a postponement, but whether
it might oppose the request if min
rs asked for more time, not an un
usual proceeding, officials declined to
say. '
"The only thing that can stop the
proceeding started by the United
States is for the miners to call off
the strike," the attorney general re
iterated time and again. ,

"They wavned. me there would be a

their military forces are under no ob-.

the general operation of the railroads
The Japanese troops will put forward
all possible efforts to remove any
thing that stands in the way of the
operation of the railroad, and will by
no means shut their eyes to the per-
petration of offenses calculated to en-
danger the lives and property of in-
spectors and engineers."
Taking up the American references
to the instruction to the Japanes
military concerning non-interference
in case of disputes, the note submiti
that ihoro mH in ho nnfhin im -
proper in this stand. On the con-
trary, it thinks that any uncalled for
intervention by the Japanese troops
in disputes between officials or mili
tary forces of the allied powers is
liable to create a grave situation,
pregnant with the most undesirable
consequences. The object of the
Japanese instructions being to avoid
the creation of any cause in mis
understanding or ill-feeling ,it seems
evident what great importance the in
structions attach to the furtherance
of mutual understanding and co-operation.
"It-would therefore be wide of the
mark," it is stated, "to allege that in
regard to the general operation of the.
railway the Japanese troops accept
no obligation for co-operation."
The reply then refers to the modus
vivendi reached by Ambassador Mor
ris at 'Vladivostok on Septemner 22,
and to the instructions later given to
the Japanese commanders, and regis
ters the pleasure of government that
thi3 caused satisfaction to the Amer
ican goverumpnt.

If Russell Chambers ever wishes to
slip over a knockout, he will have to
use an ax. In oiher words, he hasn't
sot' a wallop in any of the muscle be
tween his glove and his shoulder
blade, and he will nuve ;o develop
the sleep-producer before he can
stand out in first-cl.iss company. This
is the decision if ti e greater part cf
the f;sns who s.-.vv his fight with
Johnnio Celmars u; Los Acgeles at
the Grand theater.
The fig'?: the second to be staged

direction of Manager O. S. French
.v.vts vhe snne caliber as the first.
In other words, it was one of the best
battles ever presented in this dis
trict. It was four, in like the Celmars
Loughery contest, with both men in
the best- of condition, anxious to
fight, willing to take a blow and give
one ,and using every clean tactic to
gain the decision. The fight was
eminently clean both men keeping
away from aay semblance of unfair
work.
The draw decision, which was ren
dered by two judges, was well re
ceived. A last round rally which
Celmars stalled aoout half a minute
before the bell rang would have
given tiirn the decision if he had be
gun earlier, and these final 30 sec
onds had Chambers in a bad way.
The decision of the referee, Al Will
iams of Douglas, was the same as
that of the judges.
The bout started wiih Celmars
leading with a wickect right to the
head, which unbalanced Chambers
but did not hurt him. From this
blow started a battle which kept the
fans on their feet until the end, and
which was without doubt a premier
exhibition of pugilism.
Celmars led aggressively In the
first and second rounds, with Cham
bers fishting back hard. Both men
were strong, with Celmars having
a shade because of his uncanny' way
of bringing up a left swing that
recmingly started from nowhere and
usually landed somewhere along
Chambers' Head or jaw. ,
The third round was . even, with
Chambers leading. He forced the
fight, landing several clean blows to
the head and body, and finally bring
inr; up a wicked upporeiit that start
led the blood from Celmars' nose,
-While it rocked his head. In thei
fourth round. Chambers showed all
to the good, forcing the battle and
landing cleanly, while Celmars adopt
ed a defensive altitude.
In the fifth round Celmars came
Griffith was tough and weathered
them well. In the second Griffith
swung heavily to La Salle's stomach,
putting him down for the count of
right but he couldn't follow it up.
As a hit'.er ho is a good pusher.
Kid Higgins of Bisbee' and Kid
Bums of Lowell sta.d a good battle,
which was marked by il;e ability of
Higgins to conie baei; after sustain
ing hard punishment. Burns is a
clean hitter and has a good style,
which should have pal his opponent
away but you never can tell in the
fight game what the other; fellow I
has in reserve.
Those three bouts were refereed
by, Frank Loughery. the Philadelphia
Bearcat, who meets Russell Cham
bers on the afternoon of Armistice
Day at Warren Bark, who also gave
the decisions, which were well re
ceived. '
Tiny Zumsteg, 9 years old, and his
brother Truner, 11, opened the card1
with four rounds of snappy going,!
with' Tiny's clever' ducking and
straight left bringing the cheers from
the crowd. This bout was refereed
by the boys' father, F. A. Zumsteg,
who seemed to get as much fun out
cf the bout as his clever little kid
dies. The card was well engineered, with
no waits and no delays, except when
the lights went out, when the crowd
started singing "Bubbles" to the ac
companiment of the Bisbee Jazz or

the evening's entertainment. Man

to bit decisively. The fans looked
to Celmars to continue in the sev
enth, but Chambers started to lead
right from the gong. He fought hard
and fast, but his lack of a punch
handicapped him, although the round
was his by a wide margin.
The ninth w&a even. By this time
hoth battlers were covered with
b'.ood. Chambers chopped viciously,
but without telling effect, while Cel
mars' swung rights and lefts that
often landed cleanly. Chambers
showed a pretty uppercut in this
round, bv'. cculd not place it to ad
vantage. The tenth round started with the
boys in the center of the ring and
Celmars leading. Chambers was
right back at him, however, for the
first part cf the round and had all
the candy to himself, but could not
hurt his experienced opponent, who
covered up until the last half minute,
when ho staged the ?ame( kind of a
wind-up that distinguished his fight
with Loughery. Swinging rights and
lefts, with head down and every
ounce of strength in his blows, he
took Chambers by surprise, the very
whirlwind of the attack sweeping the
latter off his balance, dazing him and
sending him to his coiner when the
bell rang with a draw decision nearly
lost for him.
As Celmars has demonstrated be
fore, he has heart, and so has Cham

Paikhurst learned through expe

North Dakota in 1895 and his first
racing was on Indian ponies and with
real Iudians as his competitors. Later
his fclks moved to Denver and he
tried' bicycle racing, but his wind was
not gccxl enough. And then cafe the
motorcycles. They suited "Red," hi
1912 he started as a professional in
the motordrome at Dallas and since
then it has been one succession of vic
tories. "Red" riding a Haiiey-David-
son, won the world's title at Marion,
Ind., last Labor Day. j
He had his firs accident at Rockford ;
111., in 1914. The injuries consisted j
of several brokan fibs and a concus- j
sion of the brain.
The next summer he was practic-!
ing on the Milwaugee track when he I
was seriously injured. That time it

leaped safely from the spedlng ma

A THOUGHT FOR THE DAY
"A man makes no noise over a good deed, but passes on to
another as a vine to bear grapes again in season."
Marcus Aurelius.
HITTING NEAR HOME
AATTONAL strikes, in their incipient stages, concentrating gen
erally around eastern or middle western industrial centers,
Eccm vague and nebulous things here in the southwest. It
was so with the steel strike, and so it even now seems with
the coal strike.
But the coal strike is beginning to hit near home to residents
of Arizona, and if it continues much longer, this state may find itselt
facing a winter fuel famine, for which the superb Arizona winter
climate will be but a partial mitigation.
Jerome, according to reports from that section, already is sut-fe-ins
f.oia c. coal short?ge, and now comes the announcement tnat
in the entire Warren District there are not more than GOO tons of
coal at present on hand for irdinary purposes a supply which will
not last until Christmas. Bisbee and its environs have been put on
a coal rationing basis of a quarter of a ton maximum for each family.
The mines of Gallup, N. !., upon which Arizona is dependent
for most of its coal supply, are reported to be running on 50 per cent
of their capacity, with the strike only a week old. The result of this
condition, if continued but a few weeks longer, is not difficult to
foresee.
National strikes affect not only the centers of production, but
the smallest centers of distribution throughout the entire nation.
They are the concern of every citizen in the nation. And strikes
which are inimical to the public's interests can not long endure.
PROFITEERING IN PHOENIX
REPORT that George II. Snialley, federal fair price commissioner
for Aiizona, has warned certain restaurants in Phoenix that
'.hey have violated the Lover food act in raising prices during
the state fair now in progress there, gives rise to the question:
What has become of that II. C. L. probe so boldly launched by the
United States government three months ago? And what has the
Lever act so far accomplished? How far has it brought down prices?
The fact is that some prices are higher today than they were
when the government started its action against the food profiteers,
and the results of the Lever act, so far as any tangible effect on
the pocketbook of the average citizen is concerned, have been nil.
Mr. Smalley, says the Associated Press, "notified the restaurants
alleged to have raised prices that they must restore them to their
former level at once. He added that the United States district
attorney was ready to prosecute IF SUCH PROCEED1NGGS SHOL'LD
BE NECESSARY."
In this last clause lies the futility of the entire probing, and in
vestigating, and fair-pricing, and notifying, and warning process. It
gets nowhere because it never. seems to go beyond the probing and
warning stage. It is alleged that the Phoenix restaurants involved
raised prices in some cases as high as 66 per cent. Why is the
United States attorney only "ready to prosecute?" Why is he not
already prosecuting? Why are not "such .proceedings necessary?"
What is the Lever act for?
A few "horrible examples" ia the prosecution route will do
more in a few days toward bringing down the high cost of living
fthan investigating and warning can accomplish in the next decade.
SPORT IN THE ASCENDANT
TUB entire mil ion is in the midsl of a winter of unprecedented
. pipu'a-ity for a'l branches of amateur and professional sport.
T:;c cnthusia; m with which the country has plunged into a
carnival of athletics for its recreational momenta demonstrates
what n natural factor athletic activity is' in the life of the normal
man or woman. Dining the war the boys at the front and in the
army camps had a monopoly of sport, which was a vital part of their
soldierly training, but the millions at home were obliged to suppress
their love of contests of physical prowess and skill in order to concent-ate
their .effort;; on the more serious business of providing the
necessities of lite for those boys on field and in camp.
Now the long-suppressed athletic instinct, with the added im
pel us given if by the return of millions of athletic specimens of
American manhood from the business of war, is expressing itself
with an interest and diversity unequalcd in the past annals of sport.
Pisbee has displayed its true sporting spirit throughout the
summer, fall and winter months in the clean brand of all kinds of
sport which it has furnished the "fans," as well as the quality of
the attractions offend. This applies to professional as well as to
amateur sports to the boxing bouts which have been held in the
district as well as to high school football, and the diversified activi
ties of the Y. M. C. A., the United States army, the Country Club
and other institutions engaging in athletic activities.
In its boxing programs, this city has an unbroken record or
clean sport. Every card presented has consisted of scientific matches
by clean-cut boxers, none of which has been marred by those unfor
tunate occurrences which served to bring the boxing game into bad
repute before the war.
As long as the boxing game is kept on its present clean basis
In Aiizona. the fans are assured of the continuance and increasing
popularity of boxing throughout, the state.
DEMOCRATIC HARMONY IN ARIZONA
terr HAT "gel -together" meeting of a number of Aiizona Democrats
g in Phoenix Thursday expressed several good sentiments, and
I took i-everal commendable' stands. It endorsed the action ot
the Arizona Fedora lion f Labor in repudiating tho adminis
tration of President Thomas .1. Croaff and Secretary George D.
Smith which showed appreciation of tho attitude of the ani i-radical
labor leader.. -oven H no concrete good apiared to result from that
attitude i:i ilie state labor convent ion just adjourned. It endorsed
the administration of President Wilson and his const rutie achieve
ments. But, most important of all. speakers before the meeting were
unanimous in stressing the necessity for haimony in the ranks ot
the Democrats of Aiizona. Harmony is Hie greatest essential to
Democratic success in this slate; has for eais been I lie greatest
impediment to Hie succeed of the ' .Democratic, party. It has been
talked , about incessantly, bht has never been achieved. There is
just, one way to achieve it; and the Phoenix meeting of Thursday
gives a glimmer of hype that the Democratic leaders have at last
discovered that way.
Wilson aays that war-time prohibition will end with the signing
of the trea'y. There is more Hun one "ay to appeal to a seuatur.

WORRIES !
Not all worry is preventable, but for
the most part it can be avoided. j
Most of our fears are never realized j
and a a rule, if we meet our troubles i
day by day as they come without wor-;
ying about them before they arrive
or freeting over them after they have
passed, we will find that we have the
strength, to rise above them. j
Worry undermines the health to a j
certain extent. It really weakens the j
mental forces by tiring them out by j
doing nothing. j

SMILE WITH US
PEPY'S DIARY IN BISBEE
Nov. 7. Up very late, due to a long night the day before, and to town
to Icok up some bargains for my wife, who takes this means of punishing
me, as she knows I will get the worst of it in a trade, which gives her the
oppcrtunit yto read me a warm lesson, which vexes me sometimes that I
am not deaf. Did meet Mr. "Red" Gannon this day, who has an Auto laun
dry, and I heard seme odd tales about it how he has one employe of dusky
hue to do the work, and how he is business manager, superintendent, cashier,
foreman end boss ever .the gentleman of color; how, when business is dull,
be looks for a friend's machine along tire street, and when he has found one
he gets into and drives it to his laundry, where he turns it over to the help,
and then assesses tho cost against the owner; how he charges a low price
to a stranger and a higher one to a friend, with the thought that a friend
is not worth much if he cannot help in the Auto laundry business; how he
hr.s a plan to assess the costs by the square inch, and how he is withal
prosperous, with a host of friends and no enemies, even among those who
own flivvers. To the Improvement company, where I met Mr. Thompson,
who talked entertainingly about Bisbee and the work the company is doing
here, and how the. company is planning to be of value if the reported strikes
r.rc caKeJ, which pleased me mightily, especially when the city must rely
upon this company so much. To Mr. French, who talked altogether about
the fights, so that I left him soon, although I had an itch to stay and hear
nioie, and I noticed that Loughery's lip is well, which should make good
sport on Armistice Day. Did much work in the afternoon, having an eye
to the fights in the evening, which I saw and enjoyed well, but which I am
too tired to put in my diary, and I also fear that one of my children may
grow to be a "Long-hair," and may take offense at me for halng, in my
youth, taken pleasure in seeing some one popped on the nose. So to bed,
thankful for a good day, although very hoarse from shouting for Celmars.

Turning Back the Calendar
Seventeen Years Ago Today In Bisbee
(From the Bisbee Daily Review of Saturday, November 8, 1902.)
It is reported that a smallpox case
exists wiihiu half a block of the Naco
school house and that no steps have
been taken by the officials to remove
the case to the pest house.
Bainey Vail, who was hurt in Can
anea some time ago and who subse
quently put in a short term in the
Tucson hospital, came in on the lScn
. on train yesterday.
A! Southard was coining up from
:iif ire house on a swiftly moving flat
car ycsterlay when he accidentally
v.alked off, rolled down the grade- T.O
i'eet and sustained per? jus injury.
when Charley Thomas discovered it
r.nd reported it to Mr. Elliott, who
plugged the pipe. It was the city's
water supply from Naco and was go
ing to waste in a hurry when discovered.
WHAT THEY SAID.
The following conversation ensued
between two colored troopers in an
outpost while Jerry was putting over
S, barrage.
"Sam, Ah don't like the hum them
shells has; they' talks to me."
"You neveh see me turning white,
niggah. What they say?"
"They say, Y o u ain't going

LIES OF THE DAY
Four or five husky youths who performed before local fight fans last
night are not nursing various bruises and bumps today.
The American Legion is not going' to make a hit with its Armistice Day
celebration.
Charlie Roberts' bid for the governorship is causing a furore of commen

What Warren District Women Think
The Ideal Husband Should Do and Be
(Though The Review's "Ideal Hus
band" series was completed in yester
day's issue, so popular has the series
proved that letters on the subject still
continue to be received in this office.
Below are published a few received
In yesterday's mail. Ed.)
TRUE LOVE NECESSARY
"Editor Review:
"Have read all the letters about
'Ideal Husbands,' 'and think the one
signed 'True L(ve,' and "One of 'Em,
hits the spot. I believe a woman
loses her Ideal when her lover be
comes her husband, for the average
warm-blooded woman, the worth
while, the one who will stick through
poverty, is not won by the. glamour of
a super-six or air castles of a vine
covered bungalow, but by love which
is expressed by all these little ac.3 oi
affection, endearing words, and last,
tut nor. least, by kisses, which the
poor boob believes will continue afier
she becomes a wile, iivt she soon
awakens, after the marriage, to find
her Ideals were only a dream, and she
is expected to be perfectly toiuented
with food, clothes ana a house to look
after, simply because, O Wonderful
Man, you have bestowed on her the
title of wife. You think the fire of
love, which you kindled with your
former demonstrations of love, will
keep right on burning without any
fuel. You forget that since time be
Kan, ever since the dark ages, woman
has craed love; has left husband,
home, children; given up sociat stand
in;;; given up ai.-io thai iujcn-abUtsed
term called honor, for the man who
was able to feed her heart. Yes, I
believe Webster is right. An Ideal is
a mental conception of perrection, ex
isting in fancy only; unreal; vision
. aiy. Let me give you a tip, you Mr.
Ideal: If you would only continue to
rlay the game of lover after you be
come that Superior Being called Hus
band ,and would peddle a few more
kisses, more caresses, there would be
fewer affinities;' fewer divorces, more
homes. So play the" game, and remem
ber that I am not the only woman in
the world who wants Love."
ABSOLUTE FAITH NECESSARY
"Editor Review:
"Thank you fo. opportunity to ex
press my views, "incognito,' about
that aiticle of which some one said,
'We can neither live with nor with
out.' "I know cases where my sympathy
is entirely with the man, for I could
pick some very fine men in tnis dis
trict with whom 1 could live very
much happier (if I loved them, of
course,) for I can see that their wives
are not denied the pursuit of happi
ness, nor have they been deprived of
their freedom in many ways.
"I agree with the person who said
that the German husband deprives
bis wife of her rights; all of them do

not 'throw things around,' but the
mental suffering is bad.
"The Ideal Husband Is as easy or
as hard to find as the ideal wife, for
I know some of the latter who to me,
are 'impossible' in what constitutes
the ideal wife, so I say, God bless
(and keep) the thoughtful, kind hus
band who is not being appreciated by
the social pigmy who virtually leads
him around by the nose, into her nar
row channels, instead of helping him
to the broader, humane ana demo
cratic principles of our own dear
Roosevelt, and thereby build up her
own trail character to the same stand
ard. "The Ideal Husband deserves an
ideal wife, and one is as possible as
the other. It. is really a very big sub
ject, and two hundred words would
not contain my views, but the quali
ties I jjref er are those I would offer
in return, viz: A very loving interest
In him personally and in his affairs,
thoughtful consideration for what
made him happy, an absolute trust in
his loyalty, and I would demand an
equal standard cf morals. I have a
very exalted idea of what constitutes
real love, and had he given me the
same quality, he would have avoided
many unpleasantries.
"I want to add: Money never buys
happiness, tut the union of two
strong, beautiful characters will
weather any 6torm of adversity.

"STILL AT SEA"
"Dear Editor:
''Being a young 'hopeful,' I have
watched with interest, great interest,
your column entitled, 'What Makes

men . who wrote you, agreed on the
subject. Now, tell me what the poor

Yet, if before marriage, he coes not

of beivii: indifferent, and not caring.'

it a mighty good thing that we don't

have to admit that things would cer

the conclusion that we should be very
thankful that 'Love is Blind,' and, by
the way. Editor, I dont. snow yet

STOCKS AND BONDS
NEW YORK, Nov. 7. Trading in
Stocks today was marked by absence
of feverish contractions, which ac
companied dealings of the two preced
ing sessions. The undertone contin
ued teverish, however, many leaders
dosir- at declines of 1 to 3 points.
When the market showed any sta
bility at all. the improvement was
mainly cflie to easier money. Call
loans opened at 12 per cent, receded
in the last hour to 10, and closed at
the opening quotation.
Another factor which contributed
to the more orderly trend was the
strength of rails. Almost a score of
those issues held the better part of
tneir gains oi io pu.ma uuUC1
lead of Southern Pacific.
The usual favorites in the steel, 1
equipment, motor and oil groups were
inclined to throw off their recent
Leavir.ess at times, but fell away to- ,
wards the end, when fresh pressure
developed. Shipping, tobacco, leather.
rubber andunclassified specialties
which figured in the advance of the
previous month also were reaction-
ary. probably as a result of the lack
of pool support. Several of the motor
access ories were conspicuously strong
with chemical and fertilizer issues. A
thirteen-polnt rise in Associated Oil
wa3 the. noteworthy feature.. Sales,
1.250,000 shares.
Libert yissues without exception
were lower. The general bond list
also evinced irregular tendencies.
Total sales, par value, $15,575,000.
Old United State3 bonds were un-
changed on call.

tomorrow will say: '.'The trade and

in purely coal mining regions, almost

some cases, supplies of coal for fu-
ture manufacturing needs are small.
tut reports from large consuming cen-
ters point to thirty to sixty days' sup-

fidence is expressed that the strike
will end before the extreme pinch
comes. The heartening effect upon
business men of the strong stand
taken by the government to help
cider and to insure the non-union
mines which employ a third of the
toft coal miners, running, and the re"-
suits of the Massachusetts election
cannot be underestimated. It is felt
that the tide has definitely t irned in

BOSTON, Nov. 7. The Commercial
Bulletin tomorrow will say: "There

demand being keen for the finer
wools, down to and including half

CORN AND GRAIN
CHICAGO, Nov. 7. Announcement
that the individual permit system reg
ulating the movement of grain from
country stations to terminal markets
would be discontinued on November
50. hal a decided bearish effect today
in the corn market. Prices closed
heavy, lc to 2cnet Tower, with
December $1.35 to $135,' ana May
$1.28 tc fl.2S. Oats lost ic to 1c.
In provisions the outcome varied
from 5c decline to 15c advance.
Corn prices broke sharply after
word went around that the permit
system would be ended on Monday,
except in regard to shipments from
one terminal market to another. It
was generally assumed that the con
sequent exemption of rural shippers
would increase arrivals here to a ma
terial extent. Earlier in the day bears
derived considerable advantage from
leporls that the government might
offer large amounts of wheat for re
tale to domestic consumers. The coal
strike situation tended likewise to
handicap the bulls, and so too, did
some enlargement of receipts. Only
transient upturns at the openrng re
sulted from the rainy weather and
from forecasts of more moisture
ahead.
Persistent selling which developed
in the oats market was ascribed to
r.otice that foreign ships would be un
pble to coal in American harbors.
Provisions advanced with hogs, but
reacted when corn turned weak.

STRIKE FS PREDICTED BY-MANY
The Only Coal Transportation That Hasn't Been Stopped by the Government
BY BASIL MANLY,
Former Joint Chairman of the War
Labor Board
CHICAGO, Nov. 7. How long will
the coal strike last? Nobody knows.
But the miners, leaders and operators
with whom I have talked believe that
it ' is not a matter of days, but of
weeks and perhaps months.
The only hope for an ear.-y cessation j
of the strike would be for the miners !
to accept the presidents' proposal and ut of 10.000,000 tons,
return to work pending investigation If railroad traffic continued undi
and arbitration by the president's minished this would be little more
commission. I than enough to keep the railroads run
John L. Lewis, acting president of
the mine workers, says: j
"The strike will not be called off!
and the miners will not erturn to work !
unless they first know the t erms of j
the settlement.. We are ready at all j
times to negotiate every demand we
have made, but we will not go back a
work and buy a pig-in-a-poke in th
form of arbitration.
LEVIS STUBBORN
Lewis is known as the stubbornest
man in the labor movement. Every
miner with whom I talked endorsed
his statement in strong terms.
The government is apparently has-1
ing its plans uron a theory that if
J . - ...... ...... m v n l uj V
ing the use of the union funds for
that purpose the miners will scon be
forced by hunger and necessity to de -
mand that the strike be called off so
that they may return to wor.
Operators who have had years of

experience with 'miners had no such

and it;- people freeze if this strike
should ast even one month?
Hero are the facts:
In non-union fields are employed
between 150,000 and 175,000 miners,
or about one-fourth of the total num
ber in the United States.
With the full supply of cars and
under the urgency of the nation's
needs these non-union miners can pro
duce 3,000,000 tons a week, or about
'one-third of the nation's normal out-
ning; but the railroad traffic will be
greatly-, diminished ,because a large
part of its traffic tonnage is coal,
which will be cut down two-thirds.
There will be almost as great a
decrease in shipments of ores, other
raw materials and- manufactured

so that the railroads' requirements,

Editor Review:
Dear Sir On bahalf of the execu
tive committee I want to extend to
you especial ihanks for the good work
done by you and your paper for the
Roosevelt Memorial association cam
paign. 1 know of no patriotic move
ment of late years that has had such
spontaneaus and loyal support as this
in trte newspapers of Arizona. The
best of it is all is that the material
printed has had loyal color in almost
all instances and has bene in the way
of news feature btui'f.
Very largely through this publicity,
joined to unselfish wors or tne county
chairmen and their helpers, there now
is assmance that the quota set for Ari
zona by the national committee will
be much exceeded, though we may fall
a lit'lc short of what the state com
mittee had hoped. Reports are not
fully in and results can hardly bo com
piled uitil some time next week.
With be3t of personal wishes, I am
Very sincerely.

vote in 1920 V'
Supporting this horrid thought, they
find the following logical and possi
ble explanation:
"The Republicans are confident of
a present advantage in the 1920 cam
paign. They believe they will have a
walk-a-way unless conditions radically
ehangc or some new and ilisturbing
factor is intruded.
"How then, about the women vote?
Can the republicans afford to take
a chance on it? They're new in poli
tics, v.ndisciplined in partianship, un
certain. 'Can they be trusted not to
upset the G. O. P. applecart. Without
them, we're virtually certain to win.
That's on the cards. But with them
who knows? Better let 'em wait. The
action by congress in approving the
pmeiic'ment ought to win their sup
port in those states where they al
ready have presidential surrrage. That
ought to be enough f-rr this time."
Anyway, that's the explanations
that is developing in the minds of
suffrage leaders as to wiry ratification
has been delayed.
The Republicans can either secure
ratification in time to give women the
vcte in 1920 or can block it.
That they are blocking it, deliber
ately, cennot be proven, but knowing
something about the devious pro
cesses of musculine porottcs tne wo
men are getting suspicious.
Only action, quick and affirmative,
by the majority of these G. O. P.
ftates, will dissipate the storm cloud
that is gathering.
