Rift in London Strike Clouds
Seen When Labor Leaders and
, Bonar Law Hold Conferences
LONDON, Oct. 4. (By The' Associ
ated Press.) There was at least a
slight rift in the strike storm clouds
tonight. The country today had rec
onciled itself to the belief that there
was an irreconcilable break between
the government and the unions in
consequence of the absolute failure
of yesterday's conference between the
cabinet and the trade union concilia
tion committee in an effort to reach
a basis whereby negotiations with
the railway workers would he reop
ened. " !
Two unheralded events gave rise to
a more optimistic feeling in both
government and labor circles regard
ing the possibilities of an agreement.
Briefly, , the conciliation committee
again visited Downing street and,
after a conference with Andrew Bonar
Law, repaired Immediately t6 the ex
ecutive committee of the national
.union of railwaymen. At a late hour
it was announced that . James H.
Thomas, secretary of .the' union, and
the railway delegates would see Pre
mier Lloyd George tomorrow, after
having absented themselves from the

Rimac spoke shortly to him, but offer
ed no violence, although the knife was
in hl3 hand and he easily could have
attacked him.
Then Laine came in, and without
offering any evidence of authority, ac
cording to the witnesses, seized a bot
tle and assaulted Rimac, striking him
heavily across the temple. Rimac
rushed at him, and Laine turning talL
ran out and across the street.
In a moment he was back, carrying
a 35-calibre automatic revolver and
trying to pin a deputy sheriff's badge
on bis vest. Without telling Rimac
that the latter was under arrest, or
making any move to let him know
that he was an officer of the law, he
walked toward the miner, the auto
matic in his hand. Rimac saw him
and stepped in his direction. The
deputy sheriff wheeled like a flash and
ran out to the sidewalk, where he turn
ed and opened fire. The. first shot
Btruck the Slavonian in the thigh.
There were about 200 in the crowd
around the pool hall, and ',they saw
him stagger as the bullet hit him. He
reeled to the curb and sat down. Then
in the opinion of all the witnesses,
came as cold-blooded an attack upon a
man's life as all the criminal history
of the southwest can afford. .
Gets Revolver
As Ramie, dabed, rested at the edge
of the sidewalk, the deputy sheriff,
his badge securely fastened by this
time, walked towards him.
"Give me that knife," he said in
broken English. 0
The weakened miner turned to
wards him and slightly lifted his
hand, as if to support himself better.
Immediately Laine shot agaie. . Then
he seemed taken by a very frenzy of
blood lust, and the bullets came as
fast as he could pump them. Another
struck the already seriously wounded
man, and the rest found marks in the
(Continued on Page Two)
mediation councils for several days.
The visit of the conciliation com
mittee to Downing street had not
been looked for. The delegates were
closeted with Mr. Bonar Law jfor
more than an hour, at the end of
which time it was announced that the
interview had heen adjourned until
tomorrow.
The nature of the conference was
not divulged, but the newspaper men
waiting outside the premier's resi
dence noted that the members of the
committee seemed more cheerful when
they left.
After the meeing between the rail
way men's executive and the concili
ation committee, Arthur Henderson
admitted to the reporters that the
committee had come from Downing
street to report progress to the union.
Mr. Thomas himself announced that
he and the railway delegates would
see the premier' tomorrow afternoon.
Pressed for a further statement re
garding the likelihood of a settlement,
Mr. Thomas simply said:'
"You must wait."

10 POINTS
LEGAL-BATTLE
PHOENIX, Ariz., Oct. 4. Captain
Walter S. In galls, appointee of Gov
ernor Campbell to the adjutant gen
eralship of Arizona, lost two legal
points today in his fight for that of
fice, through a decision of Superior
Judge Stanford. The court overruled
the defendant's demurrer to the com
plaint brought in the name of Willie
Jones, attorney general, against Cap
tain Ingalls, in. quo warranto proceed
ings to oust him from office. Judge
Stanford also sustained the plaintiffs
demurrer to the answer of Captain
Ingalls, although the latter was al
lowed five days in which to amena
the answer.
In his decision. Judge Stanford com
mented on the removal by Governor
Campbell of Adjutant General Charles
W. Harris, saying:
"I have made this decision for the
reason that .the court must uphold
the law as enacted by the legislature.
1 believe that Adjutant General Harris
was placed in the office and has com
plied with the requirements of the
law of 1917, which law did prevent
the governor from removing the ad
jutant general."
EARLY RATIFICATION.
" RIO JANEIRO, Oct. 4. Preisdent
Pessoa has announced his desire to
have congress ratify the peace treaty
immediately, without reservation of
any kind. '
WASHINGTON, Oct 4. Ar
rangements for the opening Monday
of the Industrial and labor conference
called by President Wilson virtually
were complete tonight, with only the
question of whether the railroad
unions would send delegates unset
tled. '
With the transportation workers
unrepresented, many officials think
the value of the conference reduced
because of the tremendous part played
hy the rail men in the economic life
of the country.
Timothy Shea, of the firemen's
brotherhood, the only executive of
the four big brotherhoods now in
Washington, said the railroad unions
were acting together and that no de
cision had been reached as to whether
they would send delegates. It was
intimated that there was serious
doubt as to the railroad unions par
ticipating by their suggested change
in the representation of organized
labor had not been accepted.
The compromise proposals sub
mitted by the jailroad administration
after conference with President
Gompers of the American Federation
of Labor, and Secretary of Labor
Wilson, would give the four big broth
erhoods one representative each in
the conference, leaving the other rail
road unions to be represented by the
fourteen men named by the federa
tion. In addition, B. M. Jewell, of the
Federated Railway Employes depart
ment of the federation, has been ap
pointed a representative of the public
in an endeavor to meet the opposi
tion of the unions which he repre
sents.

juring probably scores. A local com
pany of militia was notified by offi
cials to be in readiness for duty. No
shots were fired. The fighting spread
virtually all over the south part of the
city.
The local hospitals were soon filled
with the injured and the city jail, too,
was filled with men arrested. The
fighting was of a fierce nature, be
tween squads as well as between in
dividuals and spread rapidly.
Gov. James P. Goodrich tonight or

appeal by Sheriff Barnes of Lake
county and Mayor Hodges of Gary.
The sheriff reported that agitators
were inciting the striking steel work
ers to riot and that the situation was
beyond his control oir'account of in
ability to obtain sufficient deputies.
He also reported that trouble was de
veloping between negroes and whites.
The trouble started when strikers
were leaving a union mass meeting.
Several thousand strikers who were at
the meeing and others in the streets
were involved.
The immediate cause of the rioting,
the first serious disorder here since
the strike was called September 22,
was the presence of a number of non
strikers on a street car on their way
to the steel mills to work.
The car was halted at Tenth avenue

passed a more encouraging day, al
though the improvement was not de
cisive. Tile bulletin issued at 1:30 p. m.,
was as follows:
"The president has passed a more
encouraging day. The improvement is
slight but not decisive."
Dr. Grayson Indicated that he felt
most encouraged by the day's pro
gress. The day was oppressively hot
and the fact that the president had
more than held his own. despite his
respiratory affliction resulting from
influenza, was taken as a hopeful
sign.
President Wilson's condition contin
ued slowly to improve today and his
physicians said he was regaining some
of the ground lost in Thursday's un
favorable turn of his illness.
Although not modifying his descrip
tion of the president as a "very sick
man," Dr. Grayson diagnosed the pa

A Rood night's rest, one of the few
Mr. Wilson had been able to enjoy
since his illness began, was credited
with aiding materially in restoring
strength and cheerfulness. During
the day the president was able to get
additional rest, but he was kept in
bed and was under almost continued
observation by his physicians.
The specialists called in by Dr.
Grayson again made a thorough exam
ination and consulted for an hour over
the patient's condition. They made no
announcement, but indicated general
satisfaction with the progress made.
The examination included a test of the
president's eyes and it was said they
were found to have been unaffected.

nature were received by wire, some of
them coming from foreign countries.

REED ENDS
TOUR IN
1
DENVER, Oct. 4. Senator James
A. Reed of Missouri, speaking here
tonight, read from the earlier writ
ings of Woodrow Wilson and pre
sented a mass of statistical and
quoted matter in support of his argu
ment against the league of nations
covenant of the peace . treaty. Sena
tor Reed held his audience closely
and was greeted with generous ap
plause, despite one or two abortive
attempts at heckling, which were
soon suppressed.
His arguments were those he had
been presenting throughout his pres
ent tour. .
Senator Reed's audience comfort-;
ably filled the main floor of the mu
nicipal auditorium here, which seats
14,000 persons, and overflowed into
the first balcony. He was given an
excellent reception when he appeared
on the platform.
Governor Oliver ,"H. Shoup spoke
briefly, referring to the address of
President Wilson, in support or tne
league of nations, about a fortnight
ago. He said he believed no Colorado
1 audience would be other than cour
teous and hoped all those- present
might learn something of the other
side of the question. .
Senator Reed opened his address by
likening his voice to "a buzz saw" go
ing through a pine knot," as the re
sult of constant speaking. He said
the audience was the best evidence of
Interest American people take in pub
lic questions and elaborated the doc
trine that power rests in the people.
"This is not a one man country,"
he said, "but it is a 110,000,000 men
country." .
. Persons in the crowd started to
heckle the tenator and were greeted
with cries of "out him out." Confu
sion ensued, but ended in laughter
When the speaker said "the braying
qf one ass ought not to break up a!
great meeting."
, Referring to the Oklahoma Incident,
be said, "I never voted for suffrage,
but at that meeting when one thou
sand women sat quiet when the lights
were cut off I about came to the con
clusion that they were good enough
to vote."
The speaker paid pejsonp.I tribute
to President Wilson and expressed
an earnest wish' for his early recov
ery. Senator Reed said he denied that
America entered the war either to
regenerate or democratize the world,
but that German acts of aggression
drew it in.
The speaker linked the names of
H. P. Davison, Herbert Hoover and
president Wilson as all stating that
the rehabilitation of Europe would
cost $4,000,000,000 or more. He said
an American banking corporation was
to handle the finance necessary, and
it was to be so arranged that all prod
ucts and money for Europe would
pitas uuvugu it luiinei, wiiu liig;
.house of Morgan as the neck." The
supplies of money, he said were .to
he secured by European bonds, and
those bonds were of doubtful value
unless they were underwritten by the
United States. Hence fhe anxiety of
banking interests for the league's
adoption.
Turning to tiie league covenant the
speaker said: '
"What Christ has not accomplished
iu twoj thousand years with his ser
mon on the mount can't ' be accom
plished by Woodrow Wilson arid

crowd. Two men, named Bell and
Moore, were shot, one through the
kneecap and the other through the
upper part- of the thigh, smashing the
bone. Last night, the latter was de
clared to be in a serious condition.
Another was shot in the hand, and in
another case the bullet was stopped
by a button on the belt of the inno
cent bystander.
His gun empty, Laine did not fin
ish the arrest which he had started
to make, although his prisoner was
prone on the street, with the red
blood streaming from the six holes
where the three bullets had made
their entrance and exit. Turning his
back he entered the1 St. Regis hotel.
In the meantime cries had gone up
for an officer of the law, but though
the street was searched none was
found. Judge J. L. Winter, however,
was in his office and hurried down.
When told where the deputy sheriff
was, he entered and placed him under
arrest. Laine refused to submit at
first, it is said, but gave in when
he saw that Judge Winter was in ear
nest. He was taken to the jail at
Bisbee.
Ambulance Called.
In the meantime at ambulance had
been called and Rimac was taken to
the C. and A. hospital, as was Nick
Pesha, who was found to have a flesh
wound along the ribs. Rimac" was
taken in charge by Dr. E. Darragh,
who cleaned and dressed his wounds.
Later in the evening it, was announced
by Dr. N. C. Bledsoe; head of the hos
pital 'staff, that the miner had a good
chance to recover, although it was
too early to make any definite state
ments. Sheriff McDonald visited the
wounded man last night, having come
in from Tombstone at the news of the
shooting. After seeing Rimac, he
motored to Bisbee and released Laine.
The deputy sheriff then 'attempted to
get a larger gun, although it was late
at night, declaring that the .32-caliber
weapon va3 not large enough to use
when "a deputy sheriff was trying to
keep a man from killing others." No
reference was made by him to the
fact that every witness to the assault
knew that his victim, after the first
bullet, was dazed, weak and so easy
to handle that a child could have
taken him into custody. Sheriff Mc
Donald left for Gleeson after releasing
his deputy sherjff.
Victim Tormented.
The trouble which led up to the
shooti ig down of Rimac yesterday is
said to be the outgrowth pf friction
between Rimac, who -is known) in
Lowell a3 a peaceable and law abiding
citizen, and I. W. W.'s, who have
made him a target for abuse and vili
fication for two years. He has worked
iq order to try to bring that situation
into effect."
Senator Reed took up the question
of votes in the league of nations as
sembly, and read from the covenant
to establish the view that assembly
members vote.
The " senator said he challenged
league proponents to establish any
inaccuracies in his statements of as
sembly powers, which he then speci
fied, controverting the arguments
that the assembly would be without
real power.

who stole the money and hid most of it in old shoes and rubbish,
barrels their home.
steadily in the Warren district for
three years, being employed for the
greater, part of this time at the Junc
tion shaft.
While working here, and even on
the street, he was a mark for his tor
mentors. "Gun-toting scab" is " de
clared to have been the mildest pf
the epithets which were showered
upon him. A short time ago, tired
of the. continual persecution which
was being directed toward "him, he
resolved to quit mining and go to
El Paso, where he intended to take
up outdoor work.
Yesterday he was ready to leave
the Warren district. On the day be
fore he had bought his railroad
ticket, and was prepared to take an
evening train. In the meantime he
entered the pool room, where his tor
mentors surrounded him again, at
tracted also, in the opinion of many,
by the fact that, it was known that
he carried a sum of money which to
taled, when counted yesterday,
$435.35. It is known in Lowell that
attempts had. been made to have him
stay there for a day or two, with
such intent, according to Rimac him
self, as made him fearful of their
pleas.
When seen at the hospital yester
day, he was conscious' and spoke
clearly. Although weak and in evi
dent pain, he made the following
statement:
"I have worked here for about
three years. I was employed last at
the Junction mine, where the men I
met in the pool room yesterday had
tried to make trouble with me. They
called me a 'gun-toting scab,' because
I would not do what they wanted me
to do. I had asked for protection, as
I. was afraid that some of the threats
against me would be carried out. I
asked for this a month ago. I know
all the men who assaulted me in the
pool room. I have known them for a
long time."
Later in the evening Rimac's dec
laration that he had asked for protec
tion was corroborated. His request
had been made to Billy Woods, chief
watchman for the C. and A. com
pany, and Fred Santner, foreman at
the Junction mine.
Nick Pesha, who was in an adjoin
ing ward at the hospital, told Deputy
Sheriff Gilman during the afternoon,
after the shooting, that he did not
know Rimac. The officer, with a few
questions, made him contradict him
self. Last night he said -that he had
known Rimac for more than a year,
and had been intimate with him dur
ing the past month, since his return
from California, where he had been
for some time.
A report, circulated during the
evening, carried the declaration that
Rimac was mentally unbalanced. Tihs
was denied in full last night by Dep
uty Sheriffs Foster and Gilman, who
had been told early in the afternoon
that Rimac was insane, and who had
taken him iu custody. According to
the officers, Rimac had spoken freely
and logically to them; had objected
quietly to being arrested, saying that
he had done no wrong; and willingly
accompanied them to the Copper
Queen hospital and to Dr. E. B. Wal
ker of Lowell, for an examination.
In the opinion of all these he is per
fectly sane, and in every way the
peaceful and hard working miner
which had been his reputation here
for three years.
As an evidence of the attack made
upon Rimas in the pool room before
the shooting, the front window and
one of the glass doors have large
holes in them, where flying pool balls
had been hurled through from the
back cf the hall. .

CONSOLIDATED ARIZONA
COMPANY SEPT. REPORT
. The following report of the opera

Smelting company at Humboldt for
September has been made by the man
agement: From the Blue Bell and De Soto
mines of this company, a total of 12,
000 tons of ore was shipped to the
Humboldt Reduction works; our con
centrator handled 7900 tons of mate
rial, while the smelter proper treated
7000 tons of new metal bearing ores
and concentrates during the month. In
September we shippd 600,000 pounds

He Won't Drop Dead
Any More
"My husband suffered terribly
from stomach and liver trouble,
which caused such bloating of gas
as to seriously affect his heart. Doc
tors warned him that he might drop
dead at any time from this trouble.
A friend in Cleveland advised him
to take Mayr's Wonderful Remedy,
and since taking it, 4 months ago,
he is feeling like a young man
again. All his friends are surprisea
at his appearance." It is a simple,
harmless preparation that . removes
the catarrhal mucus from the intes
tinal tract and allays the inflamma
tion which causes practically all
stomach, liver and intestinal ail
ments, including appendicitis. One
dose will convince or money re

HOW I BECAME A PRIMA DONNA
By ROSA PONSELLE
Leading Soprano, Metropolitan Opera House
New York City
The world now knows of the sudden leap to fame which a hitherto unknown American
girl accomplished last November in the greatest institution of its kind the Metropolitan
Opera House, of New York. Overnight Rosa Ponselle became a prima donna soprano.
In one year she had graduated from vaudeville into the most exclusive realm in music.
How ML s Ponselle achieved her task, and the ways in which she overcame obstacles,
make a fascinating tale. But beyond this her accomplishment may stand as an example
to other Americans, who are more and more coming to take a commanding position in
Vie field of musical interpretation.
CHAPTER I The Victory.
I think I was happiest for my
father and mother the night I made
my debut at the Metropolitan.
Father's business in ourMeriden,
Connecticut, home prevented his be
ing there; but Mother was of the
audlenc. She sat with my sister,
Carmlla, and heard me, as she had
longed to hear me. In grand opera.
I shall never cease to be grateful that
ehe was permitted to hear and see me
under the Incomparable conditions
surrounding that distinguished opera
organization. New York's Metro
politan. Nor that I should have
been accorded the honor of singing
opposite that great artist, Enrico
Caruso.
It was like a dream, and I confess
to having pinched myself at rimes
to make sure I would not waken
suddenly and find It o. The con
sciousness that It was all indisputably
real would come with some musical
emphasis by the orchestra, or Ca
ruso's matchless voice or through
some bit of applause by the audi
ence. Before me were the footlights,
throwing a protecting wall for' my
eyes; yet as I looked often Into the
vast and dark space which I appre
ciated held one of the most critical
audiences possible to gather I took
courage. Occasionally, during some
trying moment which found me in the
midst of executing a peculiarly diffi
cult phrase. I would catch a glimpse
of something here and there which
hone white snowy spots I realized
were the shirt fronts of the men who
were sitting In judgment on my abili
ties.
After awhile, as that Nineteen
Eighteen November evening wore on,
I remember to have felt that I could
rot wait for the decision which was
! either to 4jps.ke me or to defer the
' day' when I Might fc eperatlcally
acclaimed.
I
I
The curtain Anally fell for the last
time on that revival performance of
"La Forza del Destlno," and with
Caruso and de Luca and Mardonea
and Chalmers I went before the as
semblage to acknowledge my appro-'
elation of their presence. I felt
calm enough, somehow; I had not
experienced a feeling of excitement
at any time during the evening. I
dare say, however, that this was no
more than a form of nervousness.
It was when I at length reached
my dressing-room that the period
of relaxation began. Until I reached
my apartment I had not returned
to a state of being more or less nor
mal. Then I knew that one of two
things had happened: that I had suc
ceeded or failed. Although friends
assured me I might rest content, I
was not satisfied until the morning
papers arrived with the critical reviews.
No one who has not received a ver
dict In the dispassionate form of
cold print can comprehend what It
does to one to read of success In at
taining the heart's desire. I read
each criticism, as a starved person
might consume suddenly acquired
food, with the gray light of dawn
creeping In at my apartment win
dows. Then I crawled thankfully Into bed
to drop into the deep sleep which
follows some great effort. And I
dreamed of those days in which I had
plodded along the pathway to the
goal I had yearned to reach; days of
trials and of rewards, of Incessant
work which would sometimes carry
me forward or as work which
brings progress often will push the
momentarily backward.
In my next article I shall tell of
how 1 came to select a singing ca
reer and the early experiences which
started me on the way to the point
which is the objective of thousands
of "my 1 country 'folk young women
n4 man alike
Beginning with' this Sunday The Review will pub
lish weekly a resume of the latest and best religious
thought in the United States. The articles to be pre
pared under this head are to be non-sectarian, and are
published so that every citizen of, Bisbee may have a
just and comprehensive view of contemporary religious
opinion. The material will be furnished by members of
the ministerial association of 'Bisbee. The first article
follows.
A WORLD WAKING TO ITS NEED
On August 2S Richard H. Edmonds of Baltimore, editor of The Manu
facturers' Record, published in his journal an editorial entitled "Am I
My Brother's Keeper?" On September 2 Roger W. Babson of Boston, in
Babson's Barometer Letter to Merchants, Bankers and Investors, published
an editorial entitled ."The Need of the Hour." Each, to give testimony
to the profound personal conviction with which he wrote, attached his
own individual signature to the utterance of his periodical. Anybody ac
quainted with American business life knows that there are no two men
in the cosatry whose opinions carry more weight with commercial leaders
than Mr. Babson and Mr. Edmonds. Both are men who think a lot be
fore they speak at all. And it signifies a great deal, which should make
other men think, that at the same moment in the beginning of the present
active business Beason these two business observers felt independently
that this country of ours requires before anything else a reminder or
the values of religion a message customarily associated with the pulpit
rather than commercial journalism.
The meat of their thought and appeal as well as the impressive
identity of their convictions can best be shown by parallel quotations
from the two editorials:
EDMONDS
Above all else this country
needs a nation-wide revival of
old-fashioned 'prayer meeting re
ligion a religion that makes men
realize that if there is a heaven,
there must also of necessity be
a hell a religion that makes a
man realize that every act is rec
orded on his own conscience and
that makes an employer under
stand that if he is unfair to his
employes and pays them less than
fair wages, measured by his abil
ity aid their efficiency and zeal,
he is a robber a religion that
makes an employee know that if
he does not give full and efficient
service, he too is a robber a
religion that makes a man realize
that by driving too hard a bar
gain with his servant, his em
ploye, his merchant, he can be
just as much a profiteer as the
seller or producer who swindles
by false weight, false packing or
false charges a religioa that will
teach church members to con
tribute to the .extent of their
ability to the support of religion
and that compels them to recog
nize that If they are paying their
pastor less than a living salary,
they are robbing God and man
alike.
In short we need a revival of
religiom which will make every
man and woman strive i every
aet of life to do that which on
the great judgment day will wish
that they had done, as with soul
uncovered they stand before the
Judgment seat of the Eternal.
In the, golden rule followed in
the fullness of the spirit of this
kind of religioa, there would be a
solution for every business trou
ble; there would be created
friendship between employer ana
employe; capital and labor would
work in harmony and with ef
ficiency for the- labor, with pro-
Jit to both.
' It is not merely In the chanting
of hymas here or im the world to
come, but it Is i the recognition
and full application by rich and
poor, by learned and unlearned,
that each is indeed his brother's
keeper, that we can bring this
country aad the world back to
safety. A nation-wide acceptance
of this, the only true religion in
action, would "bring business
peace and world peace where
there is now turmoil, and men
would then cease to seek to gain
thIr ends by lawless immorality.
BABSON
The need of the hour is not
more legislation. The need ot
the hour is more religion. More
religion is needed everywhere-,
from the halls of Congress. to the
factories, mines and forests. It
is one thing to talk about plans
and policies, but a plan and policy
without a religious motive is like
a watch without a spring or a
body without the breath of life.
The trouble today is that we -Cre
trying to hatch chickens from
sterile eggs. We may have the
finest incubator in the world,
but unless the eggs have the germ
of life in them, all our efforts
are of no avail.
The solving of the labor situ
ation is wholly a question of re
ligion. The wage-worker will
never be satisfied with higher
wages and shorter hour3 any
more than you and I are satisfied
with more profits and a bigger
house. Things never did satisfy
any one and never will. Satis
faction and contentment are mat
ters of religion. Communities
and industries where right, mo
tives are paramount, have no
serious labor troubles.
When both employer and wage
worker honestly believe that we
are here in this world to serve
others, the labor problem will be
solved; but not until them. We
employers should learn to give
up and labor should wake up.
However neither of us will do it
except as we are actuated by re
ligious motives. We all need a
new outlook on life, a new poli
tical policy, a new industrial pol
icy and a new social policy. The
old politics founded on fear and
striving only for protection has
fulfilled its' usefulness. We need
a new politics based on faith and
striving for production.
Meanwhile what is happening
to our churches? They are go
ing to seed. The ministers are
paid starvation wages and the
whole church industry lacks pep
and imagination. And yet the
church is the only organization
in existence for generating right
motives In man. Schools develop
intellect, theatres and novels fos
ter passion, but the church is the
sole organization which develops
those good motives of live, sym
pathy, hope and inspiration on
which the industrial salvation ot
the world depends. But that or
ganization is asleep, and other
agencies which develop hate,
jealousy, and fear are running
rampant.
Can any thoughtful persom, Christian or noa-Christian, read words
like these with an exactly quiet pulse? For one weary generation after
aaother the church has been lamenting the difficulties of forcing religion
ok an imdiffereat and contemptuous world. It has been trying to tell
the world that its greatest necessity was religion, and the world has only
scoffed.
Today the world is in trouble, is struggling with troubles that seem
to be lncreaslmgly multiplied, and now distinguished men of the business
world, thinking men, and men capable of speaking with authority, come
forth and tell us that our first and greatest need is religion.
Thin is at least new, it is interesting, and it should cause men to
think.

NEW YORK, Oct. 4. On the eve
of his departure for Boston, King
Albert of Belgium tonight attended a
mass meeting of American war vet
erans in Madison Square Garden, and
there received the plaudits of those
who themselves had . fought on the
battle scarred soil of his own coun
try. Cheered by thousands of young
Americans, who honored him not for
his royal purple, but for the gallantry
he had displayed on the Held of honor,
the king, accompanied by Queen Eliz
abeth and the Belgian crown prince,
entered the great auditorium shortly
after ten o'clock.
Twelve wounded service men, four
each from the army, navy -and marine
corps, r-cted as a guard of honor to
the king when he entered the garden
and later sat near him on the plat
form. Among the speakers were Franklin
D. Roosevelt, assistant secretary of
the navy; Brand Whitlock, American
ambassador to Belgium, and Col.
Henry D. Lindsley, chairman of the
Legion's national executive commit
tee, who, in an address of welcome,
paid a tribute to the feats of valor
performed by Belgium and her gallant
monarch.

30 Per Cent vs. 100 Per Cent
Perhaps you are not aware that, in the aggre
gate, 70 per cent of the cost of Printing is Labor.
If you do know this, you have given it little
thought. Would you pay $1.00 for an article that
you could buy for 30 cents?
This is what you are doing when you place an
order with a foreign printer.
The Review has a pretentious pay roll once a
week. This pay roll represents approximately
70 per cent of gross receipts.
One hundred per cent of this pay rdll is spent
with the various business houses and profes
sional people of Bisbee.
Our estimate, which we believe is conservative,
is that 60 per cent of the printed matter used in
Bisbee is furnished by foreign printers. One
hundred per cent of the money spent for this
work is lost entirely to the business interests or
Bisbee.
The Review wishes to double its pay roll.
Do you see your interest in making it possible?
STATEMENT
It is a fact well-known to the business pub
lic of Bisbee, as well .a3 elsewhere, that all
institutions employing labor have been more,
or less disrupted for some time past. This
vas especially true where skilled labor was
required.
The Review has been no exception, and
with others has felt the burden of general
conditions. As all work in a printing plant
comes under the head of "skilled labor" we
have, perhaps, been ! slow in recuperating,
owing to the isolation from centers from
which competent helpcould be secured.
No expense has been spared and at last
our efforts have been the means of securing
the most competent crew in our mechanical
department that the Review has ever em
ployed. We are in touch with other exceptionally
proficient mechanics who are willing to make
Bisbee their home. Their employment here
depends upon the business people of Bisbee.
Read the statement to the left and you
will see that it is to your interest to assist
in bringing a few more high-class citizens to
this community. It means increased busi
ness to you.

Our Facilities are Up-to-Date
For many years the Review printing plant has
been one of the best equipped in the state of
Arizona. From time to time new machinery,
type and appliances have been added to keep
pace with the demands of the community.
Much new material has been installed within the
past 60 days and still more is enroute.
It is the business policy of the Review to be able
to handle any kind of a printed form, noi matter
how large or how small, to the satisfaction of the
customer. '
By offering special inducements we are securing
high class mechanics. Artisans of exceptional
ability are employed in every department, and
everv reasonable means is used to facilitate com
petency in every operation.
In fact, our facilities are now a little in advance
of the apparent demand. We prefer to be over
equipped rather than under equipped. This en
ables us to take care of extraordinary work
without undue cost.
Give us your next order.

"The report that Supervisor Roberts
and myself are not back of the El
Paso to Phoenix road race 13 quite
true," said Superrisor Adams yester
day. "We are not back of it because
we are in front of it."
"We have not offered opposition to
the race in any form," continue Ad
ams, "but on the other hand have
been doing everything that could be
done to get the roads in shape so
that it will be possible to race over
them. If we wished tc put any op
position in the way of the race it
would be easy to do so but we have
not done this and have no intention
of doing if,
Roberts agreed with what Adams
said, but added that as for himself he
was not particularly interested in the
race one way or another. "I am in
terested In good roads for the sake of
the territory they serve," said he, "not
that they may be made available for
the road race."

wants his customers to have the safest and be3t oil that can be obtained.
Veedol is unlike ordinary oil because it is made by the Faulkner Process,
which gives Veedol its remarkable heat-resisting and wear-resisting properties.
Veedol resists heat, does not evaporate quickly, and does not carbonize. It
will reduce your operating expense by decreasing sediment, one of the chief
causes of friction and wear. Try it the next time you need motor oil.

which furnished the power that drovw
the NC Four to victory in its recent
record breaking flight across the At

to Plymouth, England, a distance of
4000 miles. They were regular stoca
motors, built during the war as part
of the ' Ford Liberty motor produc

gal. Lieutenant Commander Read said,
"The engines functioned perfectly afl
the way from America to Portugal."
And American naval officers who
thoroughly inspected the NC Four
upon its arrival at Plymouth, Eng
land, stated that the big seaplane
was in 'even better condition than
when it left America.
The NC Four flight, which ha

M. S. Krebbs and family have just

car after the grueling test to which
it was put and the manner in which
it came through. .
He traveled on this trip more than
2685 miles, and used 101 gallons of
gasoline. This alone Is declared to

In some cars the battery is so
placed that it is difficult or impos

How We
-
First we look into the battery to
see if you put water' in it.
Then we use the hydrometer which
. is the one reliable way of knowing
the condition of its charge.
Then, if no special cause of trouble
appears we put It on the line to see
if it will take a charge.
But if there is plain indication of
serious trouble we open the battery up
and find out exactly what's what.
Don't trust your battery to ama
teurs or artists in guesswork, who
claim they can tell inside condition by
outside inspection.
Come here where you find ade

appenings of a Week
From Texas Oil Fields
OIL PRODUCERS
DEfflf MEXICAN
DECLARATIONS
, WASHINGTON. Oct. 4. In formal
representations filed with the State
department, the Association of Pro
ducers of Petroleum takes issue with
recent declarations made in Mexico
City by Leon Salinas, acting head of
the ftlaxican Department of Industry
and Commerce and Chief of the Oil
Bureau of that department, justifying
the darranza government's attitude
on the confiscation question. Eeside,
refuting statements by Salinas, the
petroleum producers again charge
that the act of the Carranza govern
ment 'against," which they complain,
are in violation of the laws of Mex
ico itself and in contravention of the
accepted laws of nations;
"It is admitted,' says the state
ment, "that the question of proprietoi
ship of coal lands .In Mexico and the
Spanish colonies was subject of con-,
tention; but nowhere in the Spanish
grants cr subsequent ordinances of
the Spanish Crowa was petroleum
treated as the King's patrimony or
the property of the nation. If any
contention did exist it was set at rest
in Mexico by the Mining law of 1884
"Before this date neither coal nor
petroleum had been developed in Mex
ico at all; the law of 1884 simply
cleared up a matter in question. Front
that time therefore, rights to coal and
oil were "acquired by Americans un:
der this law and the laws to the samo
effect of 1892 and 1910. By the ex
penditure of vast amounts of money,
American individuals and companies
.have given in value to these lands re
lying upon the laws of Mexico. Theli
tenure was never questioned; in fact
3t was repeatedly ratified by acta of
Mexican courts and the Mexican gov
ernment has since 1912 continuously
recognized rights so acquired under
Mexican law by collecting taxes upon
the lands and upon the product.
"The: Mexican' government's conten
tion that a mere change in contivu
tional precept, (appearing in a con
stitution which itself prohibits any
retroactive legislation, which precep
against retroactive effect was called
to the attention of the Ambassador of
the United States, with an assurance
that no law or constitutional provi
sion would take effect retroactively
in advance of the presentation of his
credentials in February, 1917) may
operate to divest foreigners of rights
legally acquired, has been well ans
wered by protests of your department.
In harmony with such protests the
members of this Association have
taken a united Btand and refuseu to
bo trapped by any of the exigencies
of Mexican government decrees de
manding the performance of acts, the
effects of which would be to acquiesce
in the confiscation and render the
American protests nugatory.
"Because we have refused to ad
mit the los3 of our properties, the
Mexican government has seen fit to
refuse us permission ' to drill on our
lands until we perform such acts of
acquiesence. The government . has
gone to the extent of sending armed
forces to slop the drilling of a wei
on a property of a member of this
- association which member had,; in
harmony with your protests, refused
to acquiesce in contiscation of his
property. In other cases, the Mex
ican government has granted rights
to third parties under mining claims
provided for in decrees .against which
the American government has prt
tested, and wells have been and arc
being drilled on such lands by such
third parties.
"In reply to Secretary Salinas
statement we beg leave to call your
attention to the fact that these acts,
as is wel known to you, are in open
violation of the laws of Mexico un
der which our investment of time,
, money and energy was made, and
violate the accepted laws of nations."
GOOD PROSPECTS
IN DESDEMONA
The Hamilton No. 2 of the Cosden
Oil and Gas company in the south
eastern part of the Desdemona field
is in and flowing at the rate of 73
barrels an hour. The well has just
reached the top of the Duke sand and
will probably be a much larger well
when drilled In. This well is an off
set to the Hamilton well of the Dixie
Oil and Refrning company,, which had
an initial flow of 3000 barrels and is
still one of the best wells in the field.
.The Lewis well of Hamil et al, in
the extreme northwestern part of the
Desdemona field, has been drilled sev
en feet deeper into the sand and the
flow has increased; to 1500 barrels.
This is the farthest northwest produc
tion in the field. It had an initial
flow of several hundred barrels from
the top of the lime, 'but settled later
to less than 100 barrels.
The Rosedale Oil company jfo. 1
on the N. O. Bearden tract in the
Desdemona ' field is drilling below
500 feet and is expected to reach the
sand this week. A total of 4000 bar
rels of storage has been put on the
ground. The company's well on the
Goodwin tract north of the tdwn of
Desdemona is drilling at 500 feet.

Bright Prospects in
Henrietta Section
HENRIETTA, Okla, Oct 4. A new
era of development is expected by oil
operators for this vicinity. It . is a
general belief that the oil production
of the field will greatly increase from
now on. Three hundred barrels of oil
is flowing from the E. R. Black well,
two and a half miles northwest of
Henrietta in section 34-12-12. The drill
is three feet in the producing sand
encountered at 2000- feet. The well
will be deepened to get a larger pro
duction. Vierson and Bagby are spudding in
at a depth of 3000 feet in their fell
two miles southeast of Henrietta in
section 20-11-13. i - . i
iOne million feet of gas is flowing
from the -well of D. C. . Wise and
others, a mile south of Henrietta
from a depth of 2469 feet. The drill
ers have reached an encouraging
showing of oil and expect to drill
the well in at an early date.
"Kimbly and" company are in a 'sand
formation at 3230 feet They expect
to get a good production from this
sand and believe that this well, which
is only a mile west of Henrietta, will
develop into one of the best tests in
the district.
A boiler exploded at the deep test
of the Francis Oil company and a
number of people who had come to
the well to witness the drilling In,
narrowly escaped death. For some
time this well has given good show
ings of oil and it i3 believed that It
will be a good well when completed.
Oil Production Has
Decline Past Week
The last week's production of the
north central Texas oil field was giv
en at 232.000 barrels daily, ft decline
of 22,500 barrels from the week previ
ous. Stephens county and the Elec
tra field are the only sections that
held their own. The declines are ac
counted for by there having been
very few completions in any of the
fields, while the older wells suffered
the usual declines and some of them
very heavily. The report for last
week follows: Burkburnett, thl3
week 79,500 barrels, last week 88,500;
Electra, unchanged at . 10,250 barrels;
Ranger, this week 60,000 barerls, last
week 63,000; Desdemona, this week
36,500 barrels, last week 48,500;
Stephens county, this week 44.00U
barrels, last week, 43,500. There ars
no marked . changed in the smaller
pools.
300 Barrel Well
Near Silver Cycle
News received at the local office of
the Silver Cycle Oil company from
Wichita Falls Is to the effect that u
well at a depth of 1200 feet, making
300 barrels has come in adjoining the
Silver Cycle's 20 acre holdings in the
Donahue tract, southeast of Burkbur
nett. It is believed that this new
shallow field is being opened up as
this Is the third well of its kind to
be brought in within the last 30 days.!
Silver Cycle is; running' some of it's
oil into the pipe lines and the con
gestion there is gradually being re
lieved.
Silver Cycle expects early to pay u
dividend.
Ocean Oil Well
Producing 6,000
2,200 FEET
Twenty-two hundred feet deep and
past all the formations that cause de
lays. This is the latest good news from
the Home Oil company's Pearl An
derson well at Desdemona. A very
few days now and Home stockhold
ers will know whether the Anderson
well is to be a sensational gusher or
merely an ordinary producer there
is almost no question about it hitting
oil for there are oil wells all around
it.
Secretary W. R. McConnell wires
from Desdemona, under date of Sep
tember 25: ;
"Some caving past two days in well
but .have it exhausted. Depth now
2200 and we are past all formation
that causes delays. Only a few more
days and Home Oil will be in the
producing class."
Pipe Line Runs
A total of 46,140 barrels of oil was
being run daily from the Desdemona
oil field in August, according to com
pilations of pipe line reports just re
ceived. Thus the Desdemona Held
has nearly as great production as all
of the rest of Eastland county, accord
ing to the same reports, the Eastlana
and Ranger fields being given a pro
duction of 47,740 barrels daily, or an
average of 110 barrels a day for 434
producing wells out or 515 wells sunk
in the county, exclusive of the Des
demona field.
" The reports place the percentage
of dry holes for the county, exclusive
of ' Desdemona, which community is
rated as the northern end of the Co
manche county Duke-Knowles field
at 18.67' and of producers at 81.67 per
cent.
The number of dry hoies is regard
ed as low for any oil field. The pro
duction, however, has held up only
fairly well, as the producing wells in
cluded in tne reports; had average In
itial production of 627 barrels daily,
dropping off to 110 barrels'; , Recent
statistics placed the percentage of de
cline of Ranger field wells at 14 pet
cent a month.
" The pipe line reports, of course, do
not include some oil shipped out by
train and by other means, probably
running to a considerable amount,
but the reports are much more .nearly
in agreement with taxation reports
submitted to the state comptroller
than the usual production reports.
Texas Wonder Pool
Flows 2,000 Barrels
O. M. Wold, the PreBcott broker,
received a telegram recently announc
ing that the. Texas Wonder Pools Oil
company has just brought in a 2000
barrel well in the northwest exten
sion of the Burkburnett field. Wold
placed a fair block of Texas Wonder
Pools stock among his clients in Pres

Item up to almost 140,000,000 against
the deficit of $53,000,000 reported a
fortnight ago.
Bonds were firm, several of the
speculative rails following the course
of allied shares, especially Southern
Facific. Liberty bonds were steady,
Internationals featureless. Total sales,
par value, aggregated $6,750,000. Old
United States bonds were unchanged
on call during the week.
NE YORK. Oct., 4. (Weekly Finan
cial Review) Continuance of indus
trial disturbances, the violent move
ment of call money and the illness of
Fresident ilson left their heavy im
press upon this week's erratic and
active stock market, the daily turn
over of the five full sessions averag
ing well over 1,000,000 shares.
To these factors was added another
adverse movement in foreign ex
change, especially the London rate, for
which the graver outlook of the Brit
ish railroad strike was held mainly
responsible.
The turn into the year's fourth quar
ter, with, the interest and dividend
payments Involving much shifting of
loans, accounted in a measure for the
vagaries of call money, which fluctu
ated between 6 and 15 per cent but
the smaller supply of time funds, re
sulting in a firmer tone, anticipated
crop moving requirements.
On the rise of prices during the
early days of the week, in which
rails participated, there were indica
tions of a resumption of public buy
ing but the demand from the quar
ter came to an anrupt halt when the
short interest assumed control of the
market. .
. Jiore than,ja small pato,.the Oc
tober cash disbursements found its
way into investment channels, judging
from the sustained strength of Liberty
bonds and the free absorption of new
capital flotations, the largest of which
being the $100,000,000 preferred stock
offering of the Standard Oil company
of New Jersey.
The visit of the ' king of Belgium
Is expected to hasten negotiations for
a large loan to that country, but in
high financial circles opinion is well
nigh unanimous that credits to other
European countries will remain in
abeyance pending the senate's ratifica
tion of the peace treaty.
THE CORN MARKET
CHICAGO, Oct. 4. Corn advanced
in price today notwithstanding that
considerable weakness prevailed at
the outset, gossip that a bill would be
introduced in congress to restore the
import duty on corn .was to some ex
tent responsible for the advance.
Prices closed firm to l'ic net high
er with December $1.24 to $1.24 and
May $1.22 to $1.22. Oats gained
to ic In provisions the outcome
ranged from 30c decline to a rise of
50 centt. "
The downward tendency shown by
the corn market around the opening
appeared to be due chiefly to fear of
Argentine competition and to uncer
tainty over President Wilson's illness.
Selling however was not aggressive,
and sentiment qui6kly changed in fa
vor of the buying side. Activity of
seaboard demand for oats was the first
strengthening factor. Then came more
or lets optimistic reports about the
president and still later the talk of a
bill if enacted which would decidedly
handicap any shipments of Argentine
corn to the United States. Lightness
of country offerings operated also as
a bullish influence before the market
closed.
Big sales to the seaboard lifted the
oats market. The effect, though, was
subsequently counterbalanced in a
measure by week end realizing.
Provisions averaged higher owing
to packers incessant bidding for Jan
uary lard.
MONEY MARKETS
NEW YORK, Oct. 4. The actual
condition of clearing house banks and
trust companies for the week shows
that they hold $39,605,740 reserve in

Says "Jack Dempsey Tiger Of Tne King
Heavyweight Champion of the World Tell A Secret of the Training Which
Helped Get Him Into Such Superb Condition That He Was Able to Whip the
Mighty Jest Willard and Prove Himself
E
OF THE AGE
fit ' ilSli? V "fed? t
Jack Kearns, Manager for Dempey, Jimmy
DeForest, Chief Trainer, and Others Give
Opinions How Nuxated
Iron Helps Strengthen the
Nerves, Restore Wasted
Tissue and Build RED
BLOOD, STRENGTH
and ENDURANCE.
Since his overwhelming
Victory st Toledo when he
rested the World's Cham
pionship title from the Goliath-like
Jess Willard. Jack
Dempsey, the modern David
and Miracle Man of the
fistic World Jack Kcarna,
His manager, ana
Jimmy DeForest, his
chief trainer, bare
been besieged with
inquiries as to the
methods employed in
rounding bim in
to such superb
condition. That
Jack Dempsey
used Nuxated
Iron as a part
of the training
-which produced
such marvelous
physical development as to make him a
veritable human dynamo, should prove
conclusively the paramount value he
. attached to this master strength and blood
builder and he explains below 'why he now
recommends it to others.
Just as when a man's life is at stake, physi
; cians seek only the tried and proven treat
ment, so when the World's Championship
hung in the balance, Dcmpsey's trainers did
not stop to experiment with meti'.'.ic iron
preparations Nux and Iron or other prod
ucts of questionable value, but they insisted
upon having only genuine Nuxated Iron,
which they felt coula be absolutely relied
upon to help build red blood, power and .
stamina.
In connection1 with this feature of his
training regarding which Dempsey himself
makes a statement below, Jimmy De Forest,
the Champion's Chief Trainer, is y.io:cd as
saying: 'l-'or seven weeks previous to July
4th 1 was in sole charge of the training and
preparing of Jack Dempsey far his fight
with Jess Willard. During the tra'ning peri
od Dempsey was regularly given by rr.e
Kuxated Iron and I believe it contributed
to his success."
The importance that the Champion him
self places up:n the part Nuxated Iron
played in winning for him the highest
laurels known in the athletic world is
clearly shown in the following statement
made by Jack Dempsey at his training
quarters in Toledo, the scene of the big
battle, when he said: "Alter commencing
the use of Nuxated Iron during my train
ing for the big fight with Jess Willard, I
soon noticed that I could stand harder
strains with less fatigue than before, and I
realized that I had found a tonic and blood
builder which played an important part in
getting me into fine condition. Formerly
I had relied solely upon strength-building
foods and outdoor exercise to keep my blood
rich in red corpuscles, but with the World's
. Championship at stake. I felt that I should
uylbui uuuuue that might help me to
ft'-' mrn&
win. I was advised of
the great value of Nux
ated Iron for building
up the blood, strength
ening the nerves and
aiding in keeping the body
fit, and I am f.rrr.ly con
vinced that its use has
helped to wonderful'.
increase my t;a .ir.a an-f
endurance. Nuxated
Ircn put added power
behind my pur.th ar.d
helped me to accomplish
what I did at Toledo.
From the results in my
own esse, where the
possession of super en
durance is necessary, I
feel that I am in a
position to strongly
recommend Nuxatcd Iroa
to every man and woman who wants to
build greater sirenjrth, energy and power."
In connection with the foregoing state
ment made by Jack Dempsey, Dr. James
Francis Sullivan, formerly physlcisn of
Bellevue Hospital (Outdoor Dept.), New
York, and the Westchester County Hospital,
said: "In my opinion whoever made the
suggestion that Nuxated Iron should play
a part in getting Dempsey into condition is
to be commended for his foresight. No
man without plenty of rich, red blood 611cd
with health-giving and strength-building
iron could withstand the terrific onslaughts
" a giant like Willard. It should occur to
Manager Jack Kearns
who closely watched
from day to day the
progress of Deir.psey's
trcar.ir.g in which Nux
ated Iron played a part
and who predicted
Dempsey' victory
over Yiilard.
Jimmy DeForest, the
Champion's Chief
Trainer, tells here
why. he believes the
use of Nuxated Iron
by Dempsey contri
buted to his success.
every thinking person that
if a man as physically fit as
Denpsey should consider it
advisable to take Nuxated
Iron, how much more important it is for
the areruce man or woman to see that
there is n lack cf iron in the blood. To
be!p make strong, keen, red-blooded Ameri
cans there is nothing in my experience
which I have found so valuable as organic
iron Nuxated Iron.

THE TERRIBLE INFANT
THE ITALIAN government no doubt finds the Fiume situation ex
it is to the Peace Conference. The conference has been at work
tremely embarrassing, but probably not more embarrassing than
a good many months putting out peace treaties of considerable
pretentions. It has handed them out quite generally and recom
mended them strongly as being just the thing needed to satisfy every
body and guarantee world peace for any number of years that might
be mentioned.
But it seems these bland arrangements weren't understood by
D'Annunzio, or else he didn't care for them. When Italy was de
prived of Fiume he took possession of it by force and holds it, a rebel
against both the Allies and Italy. Italy disclaims his action, of
course. Italy could do nothing else. The government assures the
Allies that It has spoken to D'Annunzio about his behavior but finds
him quite deaf to the voice of reason.
This is about all the Allies can expect of Italy. If D'Annunzio
is to be driven out of Fiume by force It looks like an Allied Job. But
it is not a Job the Peace Conference can expect much popularity
from. Nor is the necessity for It a very strong recommendation for
the peace treaties, or for the League of Nations. If the conference
cannot enforce its decrees while it is still in session, and while the
victorious armies of the Allies are still in being, the prospect of fu
ture quiet in Europe cannot be called exactly bright. And next to
permitting D'Annunzio to defy the Allies the worst thing that could
happen would be the making o war upon him. ' !
On the whole the necessity for Italy to look sorry over the un-
fortunate occurrence and to urge the Allies not to epare her feelings
in dealing with D'Annunzio, is perhaps not so trying for her as the
part that falls to the Allies. For Italy D'Annunzio is only a bad boy,
for the Allies he is the "enfant terrible".
j ANOTHER EXPORT CORPORATION j
ONE of the most comprehensive plans yet made Tor extending our
export trade is disclosed in the organization of the Namusa
South American Corporation under the auspices of the National
Association of Manufacturers. The new concern will operate
under the Webb-Pomerene act, which permits combinations In
under the Webb-Pomerene act. which permits combinations in
furtherance of foreign trade, but it differs in one important respect
from similar corporations previously fomed to take advantage of that
act. Such corporations, as a rule, have been organized to deal in
tpocial commodities, such a copper, steel and textiles. The Namusa
enterprise is much broader in scope. Its charter has been framed
fo that any group, or any number of groupss of manufacturers may
engage in export trade activities through that corporation, and win
afford an opportunity for even the small manufacturer to participate
In such trade because of the wide distribution of the corporation's
expense among the members of the National Association of Manu
facturers. In a general way, the Namusa plan, as explained by its promoters,
provides an active, efficient and economical organization through
which American manufacturers will present a united front in world
markets, enabling them to combat foreign competition effectively, to
procure trade accommodations from foreign governments, to facilitate
satisfactory shipping, forwarding and banking relations, to work for
equitable customs and tariff regulations, to minimize possible dis
criminations against American producers, to oppose imitations ot
American products, to discourage any unfair practices in foreign trade,
mrd generally to uphold abroad the integrity of American manufac
turers and merchandise as well as to protect the foreign buyer.
The plan is based upon group organization along natural trade
lines, each group being completely departmental and privileged to
direct its own affairs as efficiently as a separate export association
might do. The board of directors, consisting of one member from
each group, will control all the larger matters relating to foreign trade
which affect the common interests of all, and this board, therefore,
will constitute a permanent export trade council representing and
coordinating the export interests and activities of the different
industrial groups which form the corporation's membership, It is
pointed out that the new plan thus assures a practical flexibility ot
trading operation, combined with the prestige of large organization,
to a greater degree than any minor single industry export association
could possibly attain.

ECONOMY IN APPROPRIATIONS NECESSARY
IN ANSWER TO A LETTER
(Written to Mr. Pepy's.)
Whatever goes up must, too, come down,
Is an adage twice true in Bisbee town,
Where the propped-up .houses that gaily ride
On Chihuahua hill's precipitous side
Seem about to climb where the breezes blow,
Or slip to the canyons that lie below.
While their seemingly gratified denizens
Slovaks or Poles or swart Mexicans,
Walk up in the night-time and down in the day,
As if their endeavors were all merely play.
But, at the same time, the newspaper man
Gets away from as much of the trails as he can,
While he hopes that the council, when meeting again.
Will take some cognizance of snowfalls and rain;
And he adds his own tears to the taxpayers' prayers,
That soon we shall have all those much-promised stairs!

MESA FIRE DEPARTMENT
GETS REEL OF NEW HOSE
MESA, Oct. 4. The new fire hose
for the city fire department has ar
rived. There are 1500 feet of Para
gon hose, the best on the market.
The cost was uearly $2,000. The new
Seagrave triple combination fire
truck was shipped from the factory
at Akron, Ohio, on September 13, and
is expected to arrive here about the
eighth of October. The new truck
cost 15,000 and is the. latest in fire
pumps. Seven new hydrants have
also arrived for the business sections.
of town. These have connections for
the fire pump hose which is larger
than the regular hose, to allow a full
er stream of water to be taken in by
the pump. These new hydrants will i
be put in soon.
With the installation of this new
apparatus and the erection of a mod
ern fire station, Mesa will have first
class protection against fire loss. It
is hoped that the new equipment will
bring down insurance rates for Mesa.
Several insurance agents, however,
state that it will be difficult to get
the rate reduced until the city has a

WHILE the Secretary of the Treasury indicated in his letter to
the bankers a short lime ago that the Immediate position of
the Treasury was easing, it still remains true that strict
economy in public expenditures is imperative if the govern
ment is to make ends meet. Attention was drawn to this phase or
the situation by Chairman Good of the House Committee on Appro
priations this week. In a statement made on Tuesday in connection
with a deficiency bill the appropriation carried in which was greatly
reduced by his committee, Mr. Good estimated that the demands upon
the Tretasury for the fiscal year would reach the large total of $10,
831.201,585, to meet which he figured out receipts amounting to
$7,239,928,240, leaving a deficit upon that showing of $3591,273,545.
The committee has the power to limit, to some extent at any ratet
The committee has the power to limit, to some extent at any rate,
in the requests under immediate consideration, the disposition to
exercise that authority. It is usually the case also that the appro
priations allowed will not all be expended within the fiscal year, so
that later on the ultimate figures may not show so large an excess of
expenditures over receipts. It is none the less true, however, that
it behooves the executive officials of the government to limit their
requests to the lowest possible amounts consistent with the efficient
conduct of the public business, and Congress and its committees to
see that the proper limits are not exceeded.

TUCSON, Oct. 4. The Superior
Miami highway, on which construc
tion work has Just begun, is one of
the biggest engineering undertakings
of the state highway department, ac
cording to Thomas Maddock, state en
gineer, who returned to Phoenix yes
terday, after visiting the prison camp
which he has established a mile from
superior on this highway.
Fred Twitchell, former division en
gineer at Tucson, is in charge of the
project. An effort to rush the road
from Mesa into Superior is being;
made by the state engineer, as well
as by local people. ' It is understood
that a petition will be presented to
the Pinal county board of supervisors
at their next meeting asking that
work Btart immediately out of Su
perior to connect with the state forco
now operating on the desert. It is
claimed that this work can be done
to better advantage by contract and
that the county has all the necessary
equipment for doing heavy hill road
building. Should the board act favoi
ably on the petition the matter will
be taken up with the state highway
department of the county.
A survey has recently been made
which will bring the state highway
through Superior over Porphyry
street, turning south at Magma ave
nue and down the avenue and over
the bridge. A saving of something
like $3,000 or $4,000 can be made by
using this route and a great deal bet
ter road secured, both in the approach
to the city and through the town.
If this route is selected, as now seems
probable, work can be pushed with
out interfering with traffic, as the old
road through the Mexican town can
be used a3 at present, and a connec
tion inade with the highway, at Uie
new Queen creek crossing. ' J j j ,

CHICAGO, Oct. 4. Cincinnati needs
only two more games to bring the
world's championship flag to the
banks of the Ohio. Chief Moran's
red-legged National leaguers today
defeated the Chicago White Sox a
the fourth game of the series, 2 to 0.
The path ahead of the American
leaguers is strewn with rocks, broken
glass and sown with Canada thistles
in the view of followers of the game,
for they must win four of the remain
ing games to win the bunting, and
dare not lose two, and in the opinion
of unprejudiced persons it ought
be very easy to drop a brace to a ctutj
going like the Reds have been.

the locals, for they had hoped thai
as the Reds had won two straigat
games on their home grounds, the
Sox would do likewise. The 3 to 0 win
of the locals yesterday roused enthu
siasm to a high pitch and the attend
ance today, 34,363, heaviest of. the
series, attested the aspirations of tne
Chicagoans.
Eddie Cicotte, who was driven out
of the box in the opening game ai
Cincinnati, where he suffered the
most humiliating defeat of his care,
elected to retrieve his renown today,
but while the held the Reds to five
hits and issued no passes, two tn
those hits came in one inning, and Tie
himself in that inning bunched two
errors, which proved costly.
Ring Allows Three Hits.
The regular order of things brougat
Jim Ring into the pitchers' box for
the Reds, but the fact that he allowed
but three hits, wtucn were as scat
tered a3 soda fountains in the Sahara,
was somewhat marred by the fact
he passed three Sox batsmen on wide
ones, and hit two others. The fiejra-
ing back of him was nothing short
of superb. Every Red was on tiptoe,
vigorous, confident and aggressive.
They brought down long, hard flies m
a way to discourage all opposition,
and fielded the ball with the greatest
dash and brilliancy. This was pa-
ticularly noticeable in thesecond ana
third innings, when it was a question
whether the big right hander woua
collide with the aviator who was pei
forming above or join the list n
baseball idols which Garry Herrmann
is offering his layol following in Cm
cinnati. In the opinion of those who
claim to be able to read the psychic
reflexes of diamond athletes that
aviator will lead a lonesome life if fie
waits for J. Riag.
- The day had been hot up to tfie very
moment that the announcer, having
parked himself on second base, . an
nounced with marked formality that
Mister Nallin, Mister Quigley, Mistei
Evans and Mister Rigler would do tae
umpiring and a vendor was shouting
that "you couldn't tell the umplrea
without a program," but at that mo
ment, as if someone had opened an
ice box, there was a cold blast whlcn
remained throughout the rest of the
day, and spectators quickly hustlea
back into their coats and reafflxeu
their collars. The bleacherites tore
paper and tossed it into the breeza
until it looked like a snowstorm.
Cicotte Cheered.
Cicotte was cheered as he walked
to the mound, more in hope than ex
pectation, and therf was a noticeaDe
silence as Rath, the first man np,
singled to short left. Daubert, how
ever, hit into a double play and RI3
berg went out and played left field
long enough to gather in Groh's ex
aggerated pop.
It was one-two-three in the Sox
half also, with' Ring showing a world
of speed, which kept the Sox poppmg
up so fast that it looked dangerous
for the aviator, who rarely went from
the field. Liebold, first up for the
Sox, sent up a high one, which drlrt
ed in the breeze so that Daubert waa
kept hopping backward for some time
before he grabbed it. Collins poppeo.
up to Rath, while Duncan raced bacs
and gathered in Weaver's long fly iu
brilliant fashion.
In the second Cicotte twisters
couldn't be kept on the ground, Roush,
Duncan and Kopf flying out in order.
In their half the Sox appeared more
threatening than at any other period.
Jackson, who regards hairpins aa tne
ultimate In bringing good luck, car
ried four new ones as he came to bat,
and the hairpins delivered a clean
double to center.. Felsch sent him w
third by the sacrificial route and the
stands went wild with delight. Gan
dil, however, retired on a fly to Grox.
Then Ring did one of two things he
either became wild, or played a bit
of the most daring strategy, for he
walked Risberg and Schalk, filling the
bases. This brought Cicotee to tno
plate. The crowd generally com
mented that it was his opportunity
to win his own game, but his swing
caught the ball far up the handle
and he was out at first, thus dissolv
ing one of the local's two chances to
Bcore.
The next opportunity came in tn
succeeding round. Liebold lined to
right along the foul line, but Neals,
by a magnificent run, captured it wltn
a catch with was cheer banditry. Col
lins was hit by the pitcher and torw
down to second when Weaver ground
ed out to Daubert unassisted. Jackson
hit to Rath, but his hairpins were still
working and he camped on first while
Rath was juggling the ball and malt
ing a hurried throw, t Collins mean
while reaching third. Felsch, how
ever, was unable to produce a hit, and
another local hope was interred. The
Sox never threatened again, save re
motely in the fifth, when Groh's error,
a wild heave to first, placed Liebou
on second with one down. Groh made
a wonderful stop of Collins' hard hit
ball and Liebold was run down be
tween second and third. Weaver's
out ended the rally. Thereatfer Ring
held the game in the palm of his hand,
with his fingers crossed. He allowed
one more hit in the sixth, a base on
balls in the seventh, another hit In
the eighth and his last pass in tfie
ninth, but these outcroppings lackeu
that relationship with their kind nec
essary to produce runs and naver
gave the Reds a moment's worry.
The story o fthe Red victory be
longs to the fifth inning alone. In
no other round did they get a runner
past first. Sharp fielding, Cicotte's
sterling pitching and two sharp dou
ble plays tell the story of the innings
other than the fifth. Roush starteu
this momentous round by dumping
the ball In front of the plate, anc
was out at first on a hair line deci
sion. Duncan bounced an awkward
one toward Weaver, and Cicotte
grabbed it, but in his haste threw a
fathom or so over Gandil's head. That
started the debacle. Schalk, who gets
into nearly every play, retrieved th
ball, but Duncan was safe on second.
Timely Hitting.
.The timeliness of the Reds' hitting
in evidence in all of the games which
they have won, was again in evidence.
Koph singled to short left, Jackson
taking the ball on the bound as hs
fan forward. Duncan was tearing
for the plate. Jackson threw perfect
ly for the plate and it looked like a
certain out, when Cicotte, whos
nerves by reason of his previous erroi
seemed out for an altitude record,
interposed his mitt, evidently to make
a play on Kopf, and deflected th
ball. Duncan counted and Kopf e
tablished himself on third. Neale
then doubled just out of reach of
Jackson, scoring Kopf. Wingo and
Ring grounded out, ending the innrag
and the scoring.
The fifth game of the series will
be played here tomorrow and the
sixth in Cincinnati Monday unless tne
weather man interferes.
Walter Ruether, who pitched Cin
cinnati to a 9 to 1 victory, in the firs?
game of the series, and "Lefty" Will
iams, the Sox southpaw, probably wju
be the opposing pitchers in the fifth
game of the" series tomorrow, it was
indicated tonight in statements by
Managers Gleason and Moran. Will
iams faced the Red Legs in the sec
ond game at Cincinnati, losing 4 to2.
"With three victories to our credit,
nothing will stop the Reds now from
winning the world's championship,"
said Manager Moran tonignt. . "We
have beaten Cicotte twice and will
beat Williams tomorrow If Gleason
decides to pitch him."

I
.iicooraging
olseevism
Everything that falsely encourages
unrest also encourages bolshevism. '
Misunderstanding of American indus
trial organization, and of its benefits to
mankind, leads to unrest, dissatisfaction,
and radicalism.
For example, the Federal Trade Com
mission tells the public that the large
packers' had an agreed' price for lard
substitute (made of cotton-seed oil.)
i ...
. It reproduces letters taken from the
files of one of the packers, showing
that such agreed price existed. ;x
But it failed to mention that the agreed
price was determined at the request of
and in co-operation with the Food
Administration!
Even the Department of Justice, in its unjust
attempt to create prejudice against the packers, has
made public these same letters, with no explanation.
How long must this kind of misrepresentation
continue? In so far as it is believed, it not only breeds
discontent, but results in injustice to our industry.

Plans to Receive
Reed Abandoned
Plans for the reception of Senator
Reed of Missouri, who was sched
uled to speak here against the league
of nations, were given up last night
when word was received that he had
abandoned his speaking tour. eRed
was to have been received by a rep
resentative committee of citizens.and
was to have spoken at the Grand.
theater.
When the request was sent to Sen
ator Reed that he speak here it was
suggested that if his senatorial duties
should necessitate his return to
Washington .hefore he could fulfill
the engagement that he appoint a
substitute to speak in his stead. No
definite word was received last night
as to whether any substitute had
been appointed. If this is done the
program will be carried out as
planned for the reception of Senator
Reed.

MEXICO CITY, Oct. 4. Ygnacto
Bonillas, Mexican ambassador to the
United States, who left Washington
recently, will temporarily take charge
of the foreign office here. Ser.or
Fonillas went from Washington to
Cuatro Cienegas to inform President.
Carranza regarding the protests for
mulated by the Mexican embassy at
Washington against incidents whlcn
have occurred along the border.
It was learned tonight that Alfono
Ziller, recently called from Brazil,
where he' had been acting as minis
ter, has been accredited to the Amei
ican state department at Washington
as Mexican charge d'affaires. Accord
ing to reports Senor Ziller is now on
his way to Washington.
Ambassador Bonillas, summoned
home by President Carranza for a
conference, left Washington Septem
ber 26. He proceeded to Cuatro Cien
egas, where Carranza is staying dur
ing the treatment of Mrs. Carranza
in a hospital there.
According to Washington dis
patches the view was expressed in
some quarters that: Ambassador Bon
illas would not return to Washington
until Henry P. Fletcher, American
ambassador to Mexico, returned to
the Mexican capital.
Citv Still Without
House Numbering
What has become or the city house
numbering plan?
Some time ago it was suggested at
a council meeting that Bisbee has
long since passed the village stage
and that it should not be necessary
to get an old time resident for a
guide in order to find any given
house or building. Although all the
councilmen agreed at the time that

FEARED HE'D
IKE TO OUT
Hayes' Health Badly Run Down. When
He Began Taking Tanlac
Gains 18 Pounds.
"I was worried all the time with
the fear of getting to where I couldn't
earn a livelihood," said J. Hayes, a
well-known employe of the Seattle
Street Railway company, living at the
New Central Hotel, Seattle, Wash., In
a statement at the Bartell Drug Store,
recently.
"But a few bottles of this Tanlac,"
he continued, "have turned things
right about for me, for I am now en
joying as good health as I ever did.
I had gotten in such bad shape on
account of stomach trouble and rheu
matism that I had to stop work. ' The
rheumatism was so had in my right
arm and shoulder, that ; I lost all use
of them. I couldn't even pick up jny
tools while trying to work, and I sim
ply suffered agony. I ached so bad
I could scarcely get out of bed in the
morning, and when I did manage to
get on my feet I felt worse than on
going to bed. My stomach was In
such a bad fix- that nothing agreed
with me and at times I would have
cramping pains that would almost
double me jip. I would bloat all up
with gas and have such a pressure
around my heart that I would nearly
suffocate. I was b.adly constipatea
and constantly taking something for
this, as well as for my other troubles,
but kept getting worse.
"Finally I just got right down to
where I couldn't work at all, and was
worried because I could see no hope
of getting any better. Why, at the
time I got .Tanlac I had been unable
to work for a .month, and it looked
like I was going to be disabled for
good. I had dropped down in weight
from one hundred and forty-six
pounds to one hundred and twenty
eight. But since taking Tanlac I
have gained eighteen pounds and am
now up to. one huadred and forty-six.
I could feel good results almost as
soon as I began taking Tanlac, and it
was only a few days until I was back
on tho job. I have taken four bottles
now and all my ailments have lefi
me, and I mean by that, that the
rheumatism, stomach trouble, consti
pation and everything is gone. I can
now pick up my tools and go about
my work as only a strong well man
can. When morning comes I bounce
but of bed like a sixteen-year-old and
am just feeling fine all the time. Tan
las has certainly been my friend and
there's nothing too good for me to
say tor it."
