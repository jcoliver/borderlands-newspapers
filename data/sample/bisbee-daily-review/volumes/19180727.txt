WASHINGTON, July 26. Behind
the apparent lull in the struggle
around the Aisne-Marne salient today,
the high command of the allied and
German armies may be setting the
stage for the decisive battle of the
war. In that event it seems more than
likely to observers that the fourth an
niversary of the conflict will see a
flame of fighting raging from east of
Rheims to the North sea; but with
the crucial conflict in progress some
where just north of the Marne.
Theer is nothing as yet in reports
to show General Foch's plan. Flick
ers of fighting have occurred to tha
north that may have more than local
significance behind them. There Is
some evidence of a feeling heer that
the time has not come yet when a suf
ficient American army has been as
sembled in France to warrant passing
definitely to offensive tactics.
It was recalled today that General
March recently indicated to members
of congress that this was not to be ex
pected until later in the year. The
situation has changed greatly at the
front since then, however, and only
developments there will show what de
cision has been made.
At first it appeared that the fierce
counter attack launchedby General
Foe h on the western side of the
Aisne Marne salient was intended only
to offset the German effort to encircle
Rheims and further exploit the men
ace toward Paris. As success followed
succss for the Franco-American troops
and as the Italians and British joined,
the nature of the operation changed.
It was clear that the tables had been
turned on the enemy and that the nut
cracker tactics he had attempted to
apply to Rheims were in turn being
applied to bis armies.
The enemy was quick to realize his
danger. Behind a stubborn rear gaurd
he drew back across the Marne and
today was apparently still struggling
northward out of the depth of the
pocket in which he had been caught.
To save his advanced forces here, re
perves have been called to hold apart
the jaws of the great trap until the
armies of the crown prince could es
cape. Yesterday the advance of the British
northwestward from the region cf
Rhefms aroused hope among offiurats
here that the allied forces might be
able to spring the trap. The lull to
day seemed to indicate General Foch
was not prepared at this time to press
his advantage to his full power in that
direction.
The pocket is not as yet sufficiently
narrowed at the top to prevent with
drawals of the German armies falling
back from the Marne officers believe.
That the main pressure of the allied
troops today was rather against the
blunt apex than against the extended
sides of the salient was taken as an
indication that the supreme comman
der was bent more on forcing his op
ponent out of the pocket than to trap
him in it.
Should General Foch feel that he
should still await the coming of more
American troops to give a decided pre
ponderance In numbers, officers antici
pated that he would continue to har
rass the entire German flank and front
exploiting his present victories to the
fullest possible extent and forcing the
enemy to decide upon making a stand.

All Along Marne and to the
Southwest of Rheims,
Allied Troops Still at Death
Grip With Enemy
LJNDATED WAR LEAD (By The
Associated Press). The ninth day of
the allied offensive in the Soissons
Rbeims salient saw a lessening in the
intensity of the battle along the west
ern side of the salient. Only mutual
bombardments were In progress. Along
the Marne and southwest of Rheims
the allied troops. wer still at deadly
grips with the enemy.
The Germans strove hard to hold
bark the French and American troops
in the forest north of the Marne, de
bauching from the woods in strong
counter attacks. The enemy every
where was forced further back and the
forests have been almost entirely
clear of Germans.
Southwest of Rheims heavy rein
forcements have been thrown along
the front. In the region of Reuil,
where the battle line turns sharply to
ward Rheims, the French have cap
tured several points of vantage, in
cluding the village of Reiul. They
have advanced northward, notwith
standing the violence of the counter
movement to the northwest where the
Germans are facing the British, the
Germans have recaptured Mery and
Hill 204. but the British have retained
their hold on Vrlgny and most of the
other territory taken In that region.
Eastward from Rheims in Champagne
the French now have regained nearly
all their old positions and daily are
harassing the Germans with counter
attacks.
Before the fighting died down along
the western side of the Rheims-Sols-sons
salient the villages of Oulchy Ije
Chateau and Villemontoire were cap
tured by French and American troops
who advanced theit lines eastward of
Oulchy. The fall of Oulchy gives the
allied forces the key to the heights
dominating Fere-En-Tardenois which
lies only a short distance to the east.
At Oulchy forty guns and hundreds of
prisoners were captured.
Big guns have been pulled up for

Professional Baseball Men
Will Have Until September

Employment
fRv Review Tnsed Wire)
WASHINGTON, July 26. Pro
fessional baseball players were
given until September 1 to seek
essential employment or be called
to the colors, iu an order issued
by Secretary Baker today.
The secretary said that exten
sion was'given because of the rep
resentation that players may have
been put in a less favorable at
titude than others affected be
cause of their reliance on his
statement the order would not be
decided until a case had arisen.
He made it plain that the war de
partment is interested solely in
the strengthening of the mili
tary forces.
Provost Marshal General Crowder,
Mr. Baker said, has reported it was
not clear the game would have to be
discontinued even if the order were
made immediately applicable, as only
237 major league players would be af
fected. While regarding it as unfortunate
to have so wholesome a recreation de
stroyed, the secretary said it would be
a more unfortunate thing to preserve
It by making an exception in favor of
players.
He said baseball differed from other
indusrties classed as non-productive in
that its successful -conduct depended
upon the preservation of all the major
league teams scattered throughout the
country, while in most occupations
the work or fight order has merely
a series of local and more or less per
sonal effects.
Secretary Baker's order, in the form
of a memorandum for the provost mar
shal general, said in part:
"The purpose of the work or fight
order, so far as the war department
is concerned is to strengthen the mili
tary forces of the country and not to
control the labor situation. Incidental
ly, it will undoubtedly have the ef
fect of adding to the number of per
sons usefully employed and decreasing
the number of persons uselessly em
ployed. In this way the order will
strengthen the military forces because
making it less necessary to exempt for
industrial reasons men who would oth
erwise be taken into the military ser
vice. "I think it would be an unfortunate
thing to have so wholesome a recrea

WASHINGTON. July 26. Felix

giaphed to Governor Stephens ot
California a denial that while act
ing as secretary of President Wil
son's mediation commission he ex
. pressed an opinion that Thomas
J. Mooney was guilty of the San
Francisco preparedness day bomb
plot for which Mooney is under
deeth sentence.
The telegram was sent because in
an affidavit field with Governor. St-?-phens
by District Attorney FIckert,
Frankfurter was charged with express
ing a belief of Mooney's guilt to the
district attorney.
The telegram follows.
VNews association here reports fil
ing of affidavit with you by District
Attorney Fickert, which, in effect at
tributes to me a statement indicating
beiief in Mooney's guilt and urging ex

here and abroad.
"An allegation made by any one a3
to any expiession of belief in Money's
guft is wholly false. I never directly
or indirectly bv implication or sugges

to Mooney's guilt or Innocence. In
numerable occasions said that I nei
ther had an opinion or was entitled to
have an opinion on the merit as to
Mocney's guilt or innocence. I never
had one and do not have such an
opinion at this time.
"The sole task of the president's
mediation commission in investigat
ing the Mooney case was not to pass
upon his guilt or bis Innocence but to
consider whether the circumstances
which developed after Mooney's con
viction were such as to impair the full
confidence ordinarily to be accorded
to a jury's verdict. The president's
mediation commission as you know
reached the same conclusion as this
narrow- issue as that reached by the
attorney general of the state of Cali
fornia and the judge before whom the
case was tried. The reason that the
federal government was" involved was
because the circumstances of the case
widely attracted attention both In thi3
country and among the people of the
allies and therefore became a matter of
nation-wide and International concern.

Ry Review Leased Wire)
LONDON, July 26. As a result or
the last week's activities the whole
situation on the western front ha.?
been transformed.
The Germans, according to dis
patches from the front, have used sixty-five
divisions on the Champagne
front, and the whole of the crown
prince's reserves have been exhauxtec.
The only fresh reserves remaining to
the Germans are less than thirty di
visions attached to Crown Prince Run
prechfs armies.
Last week it appeared certain that
Prince Rupprecht would be called
upon to launch an attack on the Bri
tish front, but the enemy put off inis
attack and the psychological moment
for it probably has passed, for the Ger
mans appear committed to the great
battle in progress and cannot afford
to stake heavily on a dubious opera
tion at another part of the front, ac
cording to the view of British experts.
The German situation in the salient,
although awkward is not untenable.
The enemy's difficulties are not great
er than those in which the British
army was placed for many months In
the Ypres salient, before the capture
of Messines ridge. The Ypres salient
was five miles wide and five miles
deep and was dominated by the enemy.
The present German salient is twenty
miles wide and twenty miles deep and.
similarly, js dominated by the allied
artillery.
Captured documents show that the
enemy had made up his mind on the
day after the allied offensive began
to undertake a retirement to a Una
along either the Ardre or Vesle and
had actually given orders for this
The orders were later cancelled, pre
sumably owing to the difficulty of ef
fecting an orderly retreat in the pinch
ed salient. It is possible they have
decided to retain the position as long
as possible.
Military writers point out the allies
are using up the German reserves in a
battle where the Germans are contin
uously in a disadvantageous position,
so the situation is entirely satisfac
tory. If the enemy remains he cannot
undertake any important offensive and
the allies could hold the salient lightly
and devote their energies elsewhere.
One reason for the eGrman abandon
ment of the plan for retirement :s
found in the reports of allied airmen,
which show tremendous congestion
along the lines of German communica
tion. The Germans may be merely
holding on as long as possible in or
der to effect an orderly withdrawal
and to remove the vast accumulation
of stores and munitions which tuid
been gathered in this district, ready
for a great advance southward
Undoubtedly a hig effort will be
made to straighten out the confusion
which now exists along the arteries ot
the salient. All these arteries are now
constantly under the allies' shell fire,
and work along them must be very dif

lrom other positions was compelled.
The French somewhat relieved the
pressure on Amiens and captured
ground which gives excellent observa
tion. While the French infantry had
no great amount of experience with
tanks, the co-operation was perfect.
Out of the early morning storm the
great lumbering monsters suddenly ap
peared before the German outposts.
They promptly proceeded to crush the
machine gun nests and then to chase
and run to earth stray enemy groups.
The Germans had a perfect hcrror
of the tanks, according to prisoners.
During the engagement two of these
forts on wheels were slowed up by
artillery fire from hostile batteries
above the Avre river but the crews
emerged, set up machine guns in the
open and reaped a little harvest ot
bodies in conjunction with the Frenc'a
infantry.
The engagement concluded, the vic
torious French swarmed about the
tanks and there were mutual congratu
lations all around. The tanks came
back decorated with French Hags
which had been placed on thein by a
French general on behalf of himself
and his men.

BY REVIEW
(By Review LpaW Wlr)
NEW YORK. July 26. The stock
market was hesitant and Irregular in
the first half of today's superficial
session, presumably on the failure of
sensational war rumors, but prices
hardened later.
Pools were conspicuous In numerous
minor specialties, but steels, allied
equipments, coppers and some of the
tobaccos featured the occasional In
tervals of activity. United States
furnished about 40 per cent of the of
ferings and attaininR the highest price
of the week at $1.0S, closing half a
point under Its best.
Bethlehem, Crucible and Lackawan
na steels. Republic Iron and Colorado
Fuel gained 1 to 2 points, Utah cop
per and Oils 1 to 1 M points and Gen
eral Cigars was prominent for its sud
den rise of 4 points.
Ralls were extremely listless. Union
Pacific, as an instance, remaining al
together unquoted until at the end.
Heading slowly regained its one polut
reversal.
Sales, 335,000 shares.
Internationals fared better than do
mestic issues. Paris sixes gained H
and anglo French fives a small frac
tion. Total sales, par value, $4,925,000.
Old United States bonds unchanged
on call.
GRAIN
CHICAGO, July 26. Fears of crop
damage from hot winds In the south
west gave the corn market a pro
nounced upward swing today. The
close was unsettled to lc net
higher, with August $1.5274 to JL52
and September J 1.53 to $1.54. Oats
finished to c up and provisions
down 5 to 79 cents.
Notwithstanding that two days ago
frost danger was a bogey, the corn
market found high temperatures a
source of disturbance. At first con
tinued defeats of the Germans, especi
ally the capture of Oulchy, led to gen
eral selling and to down turns in
prices. Then came talk of hot winds
and there was a complete reversal of
sentiment. The rest of the day, ab
sence of selling pressure was evident.
Seaboard inquiry helped to lift the
oats market. The chief element of
strength, though, was sympathetic
with corn. Sharp declines in the price
of hogs carried down provisions. Li
quidating sales developed, and about
the only support was of a local char
acter. NEW YORK METAL MARKET
NEW YORK, July 26. Lead, un
changed: spelter, easy; spot. East St.
Louis delivery, unchanged; bar silver,
unchanged.
NEW YORK COTTON MARKET

CAPTAIN WHEELER
HEARD
FROM
WASHSN
Called There Under Official
Orders; Granted Few Days
Furlough and Will Meet
Mrs. Wheeler in N. M.
According to a telegram received
yt-stf rday in Tombstone by Mrs. Harry
C. Whfeler, Captain Wheeler is now
in Washington, having'arrived in that
city on Wednesday. The telegrat'i
stated that he was there under official-orders
and had been grantud a
few days turlouh ""d wanted Mrs.
Wheeler to meet him at Alamagoi-do,
New Mexico, to visit with him for a
few days.
The last heard from Captain Wheel
er was about a month ago, when he
cabled that he hud been ordered back
to the United States and expected to
leave France about the 30th of June.
Since that time not a word had bein
heard from him and considerably anx
iety was beginning to become manifest
on his account, not only by his wife,
but by many of his friends in Cochise
county. There had been all sorts of
rumors circulated afiout regarding
hiin, some to the effect that Jie had
been court martialed and that he wa3
in a government prison and others
that his commission had been taken
away from him and that he had been
dishonorably discharged from the
army. These stories were not believed
by any of his friends as they knew
of no reason why they should have
been started if there was any basis
for . the rumors.
The fact that he Is now in Wash
ington and has been granted a short
furlough should put a stop to these
id'e rumors. It is evident that he is
still in the service and has been as
signed to some duty in the United
States. He has been instructing re
cruits -in trench work and it is mow
than possible that he is to be used lor
that purpose at some post in this
country.
Mrs. Wheeler will leave tombstone
this morning for Alamogordo, to meet
the Captain and will remain with him
for a few days and will then return
to her home in Tombstone while Cap
tain Wheeler will continue on to his
post of duty.
The fac t that Captain Wheeler is In
The United States and has been heard
from will be pleasing news to his
many friends throughout this dtstriet
as well as all pr.rts of the state.

ANDTRUTH
ORPHEUM OFFERING ENACTED
BY MAN WHO IN REAL LIFE AS
IN REEL LIFE FOUGHT WITH
GERMANS AND FINALLY WAS
WOUNDED IN BATTLE
The movie actors who posed for the
picture, "The Unbeliever," to be shown
at the Orpheum today and tomorrow,
are certainly not slackers. StTgt. .Moss
Gill, who played an impoitant part in
tins screen feature, was recently
wounded in France. He was ordered
away to the battle front before the
picture was released to the public.
The strange thing about it all is, that
Gill is shown in the picture shooting
Germans between whiles of reading
passages from his Bible. And in real
life he shot at and was shot by Ger
mans, even as in reel life.
Then Raymond McKee, star of the
picture, enlisted as soon as the picture
was taken and is also in France.
"The Unbeliever" is said to be an
intense and wonderful picture in sev
en parts. Even the New York papers,
surfeited with war pictures and dis
plays of patriotism, raved over it, and
in Detroit the theater where it was
shown was packed for many days and
nights. The United States marines
helped the Edison people in this photo
play, and one may be sure that the
picture did not suffer any for the part
these heroes played with the playeis.

Eighth Day of Battle
The public generally all over the land
are hoping and expecting and praying for
a great German disaster in the Soissons
Rheims pocket. But this column believes
that this is too much to hope for right now.
The sudden shift from the defense to the
offense is a great change for the better and
all we can reasonably expect right now.
Later in the year the allies may well force
a serious break in the German lines. But
they may have to withstand another furious
and powerful offensive in some quarter be-.
fore taking the offensive for the final
period of the war. Germany has at least
600,000 men in reserve and she has not
used more than half of them so far in the
last series of battles. She has poured men
and guns into the flanks of the present
battle line and doubtless stands ready to
make a fearful resistance against each jaw
of the pincers pressing in from Rheims on
the south and from just below Soissons on
the north. At this time it will be a mighty
task for the allies to break through. They
have already accomplished more the past
three day3 than the most sanguine could
have expected last Sunday when, the first
force of their drive was spent. And even if
the Germans do get out of Foch's trap with
out serious losses of prisoners and guns, yet
they will have suffered frightful losses in
killed and wounded while massed under
cr,oss fire of allied artillery and machine
guns from both sides of the pocket. They
have already paid most dearly for holding
on too long. The German is pigheaded
in war. He will not give up a position as
long as he can by command or main force
keep his men at their posts. His tenacity
in clinging to his southern positions of this
pocket has compelled him to throw heavy
reserves on the flanks and sacrifice men by
the thousand at the end of the salient to
the allied guns. And he is not yet in safe
ty. He has not completely stopped the
alied advance on his flanks or the allied
pressure on his front. His position is seri
ous, still if not dangerous. As to the state
of German morale in this pocket and the
food and ammunition supply, the allies
cannot know. They may be the deciding
factors, after all. The Hunnish means of
communication are badly smashed, im
portant military roads and railroads have
been taken or are under fire and aircraft
harass his transport day and night. All in
all, the Hun, after a fine start for the year,
is now drinking the bitter drop to the dregs.
He has suffered a severe reverse' and faces
a one to three chance of a disaster. And
three to one choices have been upset many
times in the past.
FOCH, THE WHALE HUNTER
(From the Washington Times.)
Prussia's desperate, hopeless struggle
may be compared to that of a huge whale
in which the whaler has planted his harpoon
with strong line attached.
The whale plunges, threshes the water,
dashes forward in a grand "offensive,"
feels the steel, stops, sulks, then dashes
ahead again.
The whaler in his boat, watching care
fully, never in a hurry, knows that if he
makes no mistakes he will have his dead
whale sooner or later it is only a question
of the monster's vitality.
Foch is chief hunter of the Prussian
whlc. And, with interest, you recall that
Foch is the descendant of real whale hunt
ers. His Basque ancestors, more than a
thousand years ago, hunted the Right
vvjtale, b'ggest of its kind, in the Bay of
Biscay until the monster became entirely
extinct and unknown in those stormy
waters.
Scirntiils telling you of the gradual dis
appearance of the whale, tell how the Bis
cay whale, the first that Europeans ever
hunted, was pursued in little boats by the
ancestors of General Foch, in the ninth
century, and driven out and away to the
Far North.
You can imagine the ancient Basques
from whom Foch comes down in a straight
line going cut upon the rough, dangeroiu
waters of the bay, harpooning the huge
creature, rowing with him as he dashed
away rapidly, to avoid too great a strain
on the line, fighting him as he came toward
the boat in his mad rush and finally land
ing him, the foolish whale all the while be
lieving that his great bulk would conquer
the intelligence that had planted the steel
in his blubber and would soon send the
sharp blade into his heart.
What Foch's people, the hardy Basques,
did for the Right whnle on the water Foch
will do for the Prussian whale on the west
battle front be sure of that.
And now we find Felix Frankfurter, sec
retary of the president's mediation com
mission, mixed up with the Bolshevik of
Russia, according to charges of District
Attorney Fickert of San Francisco. And
Fickert declares further that Frankfurter
told him that while he was satisfied that
Mooney was guilty and had had a fair trial,
yet his release was sought, even in national
administration circles, in order to placate
the radicals, both in this country and in
Russia. The Bolshevik comprise the Rus
sian radicals, and when affairs in this coun
try reach a state where the secretary of
the president's own mediation commission
seeks to placate them by urging a miscar
riage of justice, they are grave indeed.
Fickert's disclosures will tend greatly to de
stroy any shreds of usefulness left to Frank
furter in the west. His acts, words, influ
ence and associates had all branded him as
a radical before the sensational disclosures
of the California district attorney. Like
Bruere, another "perfectly fair and neutral
mediator and judge," Frankfurter has been
pushed out in the open a3 a radical of the
radicals, thus being completely unfitted for
any position in connection with mediation
or the sitting in judgment between capital
and labor. Certainly labor cannot complain
of the president's western mediators. And
if the bolshevik of Russia are Interested in
the Mooney case then indeed hath organ
ized labor sought strange bedfellows!
It is simply impossible to estimate the
value of the part being played by the allied
fliers in the present offensive in the west.
Day and night they rain high explosives
by the ton upon German rail and road lines
and depots and munition dumps and troop
concentrations and food convoys. In every
important part of the Rheims-Soisson3
pocket the allied airmen fly and shoot and
bomb. They dominate this sector com
pletely. Only the German soldiers can
really know how terrible is the part they
play in hampering the German defense of
the allied strokes. A single bomb, blocking
a rail line may cause disaster to an entire
division depending upon that line for food
and ammunition.
It is inconceivable how little stir and
comment was made over the taking over
by the president of the wire lines of the
nation. The proclamation was issued this
week and it goes into effect July 31 . Prop
erty worth many millions are involved. The
Bell Telephone company alone employs
nearly 100,000 men and women, all of
whom will be affected. But the shock of
taking over the railroads and the shock of
battle every week or so and the shock of
so many things these strenuous times, has
made the public callous to what would have
been a tremendous sensation if it had come
alone a year or more ago.
The strike of munitions workers in Eng
land will, if it continues, be as bad as a re
verse in the field. It is inconceivable under
any conditions how a quarter of a million
Englishmen can. lay down their tools and
refuse to make shells for two million other
Englishmen standing in battle array before
a powerful and well equipped foe who
seeks to enslave England.
Well, we've kept it up for eight days,
anyway, and that is five more than the
Germans could do after more than a month
spent in preparation.
It is an ill wind that blows no one good.
The war has brought the drummer in the
band to the front. No band plays any
music nowadays that docs not have the
crescendo and thunderstorm drum tones
laced through and through every bar of the
melody.
JUDGE LGCKWOOD HAS
ANSWERED LETTER
OF DAPL GOOD
COCHISE COUNTY JURIST GOES
INTO DETAIL IN DEFENSE OF
HIS STATEMENT BEFORE Y. W.
C. A. WOMEN HERE TWO WEEKS
AGO
Frankfurter j
Tombstone, Ariz.,
July 26, 1918.
Editor, The Bisbee Daily Review,
Bisbee, Arizona.
Dear Sir:
I noticed in the "Review" of the
17th inst. an open letter from Capt.
L. P. Good, of the Thirty-fifth infantry
in which he takes exception to some
remarks made by me to the ladies of
the Y. W. C. A., at Bisbee, and .asks
for a public reply.
My delay in answering is due to the
fact that I have been quite ill for the
past week, and this is the earliest op
portunity I have had for a proper re
ply. The particular phrase to which Cap
tain Good seems to take exception is
my implied statement that the old
army was not the equal, in its per
sonnel, of our present army. In the
first place, it is hardly fair in criti
cizing any speech, to take an isolated
statement or sentence therein, but the
entire context should be taken for the
real meaning of" the speaker. In my
remarks, I was discussing with the'
ladies of the Y. W. C. A. the best metn-
ods of meeting some very real prob
lems regarding the girls of Cochise
county and the Warren district espe
cially, under the law, I am chanted
with a certain responsibility for the
young people of this county, and I am
certainly desirous of doing everything
possible to assist in their moral better
ment. Among the influences which are
not conducive to their good, is the un
restricted and unrestrained association
of girls of twelve to sixteen years with
young men of Trom four to ten year
cider. I think that this statement will
be endorsed by every mother in Co
chise county, and admitted even by
Captain Good. The reason why I did
not refer to the relations of jounc
girls with men other than the men
in uniforn is that the records of the
juvenile court show that, now as in
all history, young girls are particular
ly attracted by the uniform, and for
this reason their associations with the
boys in khaki are apt to become more
dangerous than those with civilians m
their own town who are known to the
girls and their parents and consequenc
ly scrutinized more closely.
If Captain Good took my remarks
to be a reflection upon the moral char
acter of the enlisted personnel ot our
present army, either regulars, guards
or national army, he certainly guinea
an impression which I am satisfied
was not shared by any of the forty
or liity good ladies of the Y. W. C. A.
who heard them. If on the other hand,
he took them to mean that our pres
ent army averaged much higher in in
telligence, ability and character than
our eld professional army, I certainly
did and do mean that to be a fact. I
have had a fairly intimate acquaint
ance with the personnel of the old reg
ular army from 1S80 to the Spanish
American war and a somewhat less
acquaintance with that army after
lbi3 to the present time, and I am sat
isfied that the average man who en
listed in the line of that old army was
not apt to be the equal mentally and
socially of the members of our present
army. The very terms of the old en
listment would show this. When ser
vice in the army was not a patriotic
duty, but a mere choice of employ
ment, as it was when our country was
at peace, the average young man who
was attracted by a three year Job and
$15 per month and found, with the
necessary discipline and restraint
which must be found in an army, was
not apt to be of as high a standard
as the man who now enters the army
because he considers it his patriotic
duty.
My remarks could in no way be tak
en as a reflection upon the bravery
or integrity of the iueu of the old
army. The word "derelict" used in con
nection with a man means one who
has abandoned the sense of responsi
bility, and that is the very point I
make of the old army. The man who
enlisted in the line, with some verj
notable exceptions, was apt to be a
man in whom the sense of responsibil
ity was not strong. Captain Good
seems to infer that the word "derelict"
imputes a crime, but it' has no such
meaning, and 1 was very careful to
avoid the use of any word which
would be so considered, because I
know as well as any man that the
United States army does not want and
never has wanted criminals. In fact
I have repeatedly refused to allow men
guilty of felonies to apply for enlist
ment in the army for this very reason.
1 trust you will give this commiui- j
ication the same publicity you lime to
Captain Good's letter, aud that he will
teel that he has been unwarranted in
assuming that I implied any unjust
criticism of the rank and file of the
soldiers who wear our uniiorm.
Very truly ycurs,
ALFRED C. LOCKWOOD,

tle growers to obtain speciul permits
for Buch shipment of cattle prior to
their exportation from Mexico. Now
cattle may be brought through the

Prescott: Ramsey Patersoi is ia
the city from the Oak creek region,
where he is hunting and trapping for
the forest reserve, and exhibited yes
terday the pelts of a big mountain
lion, and eighteen timber wolves. He
states bear are plentiful in the country
and tracks would indicate there is one
of size. He has been named the "Big
Hun" and many hunters are after his
scalp.
The ban is on. There will be no
more releases granted young men of
the draft ages to joiu the navy or the
marines according to advices received
trom the local board at Tombstone
yesterday.
The board was notified by the state
adjutant to stop giving releases to
men subject to the dratt to permit
thein to enlist in the army, navy, ma
rine corps or emergency fleet. The
adjutant did not state now long this
order will remain in effect, but stated
that it will be in force lor the pres
ent. This order will prevent men of draft
age being enlisted by the recruiting of
ficers for the above branches of tho
service. Up to the present lime, men
of draft age desiring to enter the ser
vice without waiting to be selected or
desiring to enter a special blanch of
the service, have been permitted to do
so with the permission of the local
board.
Under the order issued the branches
of the service outside the national
army will have to secure recruits trom
men outside the draft age.
It is a fact that there is a great
eagemess to enter the service display
ed by the men of draft age through
out the state. This desire is so strong
that some ot the local boards have re
quested that their quotas under the
call that has been issued for Augu
be doubled.
Complete reports on the recent reg
istration and results of be examina
tion and classification of registrants
are called for by the provost marshal
general for not later than July 2. r-u-ture
calls will be based on thtse re
ports. In Cochise county it is estimated
that over 250 men have secured re
leases and entered the navy while
about twenty-five have joined the ma
rines. Already out of the lil& class
there have been twenty-seven releases
so that the number of men in class one
are cut down thereby. The local boards
are not allowed any credit lot men
of the draft age that enter the service
of the navy so that in the future calls
it might make them go into calis two
if the release were continued.

Scuthewr stern railroad when the pay
master gets around to all divisions. It
w?.s said at the general office Wed

was held up and robbed of $10 just
east of the army camp. The soldiers

YUMA. (Half a dozen carrier
pigeons arrived In Yuma Sunday from
somewhere in the state of Ohio for a
military test of their ability to find
their way home from a great distance.
They were released Monday morning
at the express office in the presence
ot a crowd of interested spectators.
All the birds, except one, after making
a small preliminary circle, struck out
on a course due East. One of the
birds did not seem disposed to try
his wings at once and found a con
venient place to rest and think it over
before starting on the long and peril
ous journey. These birds were sent
to Yuma by the military authorities.
The test is a very great one, the dis
tance to be covered being approxi
mately 3U00 miles.

FHOENIX. A call has been Issued
by Vice Chairman Addams for a meet
ing of the Arizona state council of
defense on Monday, August 5. It is
expected that this meeting will have
a larger attendance than the initial
meeting, at which the organization
was effected. No official notification
has yet been received of the confirma
tion by the board fo supervisors of
Cochise county of the nomination by
the governor of State Senator Roberts
as a member for that county, nor has
the governor named a representative
for this county having been refused
confirmation. The organization of
county councils of defense Is expected
to be taken up by the state council
at this session, and it is considered
probable that the council will be In
session for several days. Under the
law the county boards of supervisors
are to select a list ot fourteen names
from which county councils of not
more than seven nor less than three
are to be named by the state council.

Mesa: County division has again
come to the front in the Mesa section
and a movement has been started for
the creation of a new county to be
known as Orange county, with Mesa

sentiment Is very strong, and coupled
with this it is understood that Mea

Phoenix: Governor Hunt this morn
ing announced the appointment of
George Webster as representative ol
Greenlee county on the state council
of defense. Webster is one ot th
prominent cattlemen of that part ot
the state. This is the third nomina
tion by the governor of a representa
tive for Greenlee county. The two
previous nominations were not con
finned by the board of supervisors,
and there has been considerable specu
lation as to whether or nc the gov
ernor would again try to meet the re
quirements ot the board. The action
of the Greenlee county board will now
be awaited with Interest. The Cochise
county board has not yet acted on the
appointment of Senator Roberts rui
that county. The original nomination
for this county was also turned down
by the supervisors. Senator Roberts
was named two weeks ago. Most of
the boards of supervisors in the state
are. now attending the annual session
of the state tax commission, which is
being held at Ei Tovar hotel. Grand
Canyon. It is thought probable that
action on the above nominations will
be delayed until the supervisors re
turn to the county seat.

WHY SHOULD HE BE? v
A special dispatch to the Tucson
Star from Tombstone says: "There
seems to be no reason for anyone be
lieving that Charles Roberts will be
appointed on the state council of de
fense, with the consent of the board
of supervisors, since Senator Roberts
has offered his services to the govern
ment. Senator Roberts is anxious to
get into Uncle Sam's service in Fern's
capacity In the mining department, as
he Is an excellent miner and consid
ers his knowledge along those lines
to be of value to the government. That
being the case, it would seem folly to
confirm his appointment and it would
appear that it is up to Governor Hunt
to send in another name unless he is
desirous of making no further appoint
ments along that line for Cochise county."
