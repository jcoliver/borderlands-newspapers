Intermediate Points, Including Arizona
Will Not Pay Coast's Rate On Goods
Shipped From East, If Plan of I. C. C.
Survives R. R. Objections, April 2.
(By Review
WASHINGTON'. Mar. 1:1. The
Interstate Commerce Commission
has placed before the trans-continental
railways tentative findings
in the inter-mountain rate cases,
proposing realignment of virtual
ly the entire structure of freight
rates between the east and west
on every commodity. The rail
roads are given until April 2 to
enter any objections.
Inland to Benefit
The time has come, the com
mission holds, for abolition of low
preferential rates from eastern
producing centers to Pacific coast
ports. These rates, put into ef
fect to meet the coast-to-coast
water competition, have been in
force for years and under them
San Francisco, Los Angeles, Se
attle and other coast cities have
enjeyed rates far lower than those
from the same eastern cities to
intermediate points.
Heeafter. should the commis
sion's findings be made perma
liont, intermediate points will be
given rates from eastern centers
as low as rates to the coast, if not
lower. Fiom other centers' in the
middle west and along th Miss-
ourl River the rates to interme
diate points will be less than the
rates to the coast.
Two Plans Studied
. Under; the commission's pro
- posal this result could be attained
in two wsvsr Fi '
ins through rates from the coast
to the Pacific ports on a nuuiuer
or articles on which the present
rate is found to be unreasonably
low.-: and second, by realigning
rates 'to intermediate points on
many articles on which the pres
ent through rate is found to be
reasonable.
Arizona to Profit
In either event, adoption of the
tentative findings would result In
a sweeping revision of tariffs
from the east, the middle west
and Missouri Iliver points to
towns and cities in Arizona, New
Mexico, Nevada, Utah, Wyoming.
Idaho, Colorado and Montana and '
to all towns and cities in Califor
nia, Oregon and Washington, ex
cept on certain commodities to
port cities in the three states last
named.
War Permits Ruling
Although not directly stated in the
commission's finding, the Kuropean
war is the direct cause of the propos
ed change, inasmuch as it has result
ed In the virtual cessation of all coast
water traffic, leaving the trans-continental
roads without competition.
With a view to meeting the expected
re-entry of steamship lines into coast
to coast traffic via the Panama canal
after the war, the commission pro
pores that the suggested rate be so
drawn as to be capable of easy read
justment. Revision of freight rates on barley

WASHINGTON GOVERNOR'S OFFICE

OLYMPIA, Wn., Mar. 13. An arm
ed man forced his way into the office
of Governor Ernest Lister today and
was in complete charge for half an
hour before he surrendered. Gover
nor Lister had heard a disturbance
outside his office and went to an ad
joining room just before the man en
tered. When taken in charge by the
sheriff the man said his name was
Charles L. Wagner and that he was
"just a wanderer." He was asked
about relatives. "All my folks have
deserted me." he said.

I Although the railroads are not di
rectly invited to file new tariffs in
' line with the commission's findings.
the door is left open for them to do
so, and specific suggestions as to the
maximum rates which should be pro
posed are contained in an outline of
differentials between Atlantic s a
ports and inland eastern cities.
Puts West in 4 Zones
To establish an equitable scale of
readjusted rates, it is suggested to the
carriers that the territory west of the
Missouri River be divided into four
zones of 600, 950, 1.300 and 1.650 miles
and that a scale of rates be applied
gradually increasing according to dis
tance. The eflect would be so far
reaching that officials consider that
the case easily takes rank with the
j five percent cases decided two years
ago and at that time characterized as
Ithe most important which had come
before the commission for determina
tion. j On reaching its tentative findings.
the commission reviewed in elaborate
detail the history of water competi
tion via the Panama Canal.
"The present situation as to water
competition," reads the statement to
the roads, "is beyond dispute. There
is no competitive necessity by reason
of water service between the two
coasts which warrants the rail carri
ers in maintaining lower rates under
present circumstances to the Pacific
coast than are normal or reasonable
or less than to intermediate points.
"It is obvious, however, that some
of the rail rates which apply, on arti
cles particularly adapted to water
transportation and which originate In
; large volume on or near the-two sea
I boards should be maintained at a lev
: el lower than present necessity re
; quires, or that provisions should be
made for their prompt reduction when
the water competition again becomes
active and controlling.
j "The uncertainty as to the length
I of time during which present condi-
tions will continue is so great and
differences between coast rates and
j interior rates are so marked that we
: do not feel justified in authorizing
these carriers to continue during this
indefinite period a relation of rates
which we believe in many respects
was justified during the period when
water competition between the coasts
! was active.
J Are Rates Too Low?
! "Our concern is with the following
I issues: Are the lower rates to the
I coast cities necessitated under pres
ent conditions? Are they in all in
, stances necessitated under normal
i conditions or such conditions as exist
l ed for the first year after the open-
iug of the Panama canal? Are they
I less than normal or fairly reasonable?
: Are the rates to intermediate points
i unduly discriminatory?"

j their eight hour day demands were ratified here today by local
union leaders from southwestern territory and by a similar
conference of representatives of the southwest held at St.

The brotherhood heads will tell the railroad conference
committee in New York, Thursday, that if an agreement is not
reached this week for the establishment of an eight hour basic
day with time and a half for overtime, strike orders already
issued to local organizations will become effective.
The demands are just what they
were last fall when President Wil

never has been put into effect,
pending a decision on its consti
tutionality by the supreme court.

EVEN IF U. S. WARS
BELGIAN RELIEF TO
GO ON, SAYS HOOVER
(Itv Review Leased Wire)
NEW YORK. Mar. 1:5 No war into
which America may be plunged can
absolve her from the duty of contin
uing to give relief to the starving and
destitute people of IVlgiiuii. Ilerbeit
C. Hoover, head of the commission
for relief in Felgium said tonight be
fore his departure for Europe to take
up with renewed determination the
task in which he has been engaged for
many months.
Mr. Hoover sailed on a neuty.l ship
(or a Spanish port and will go to Far
is. Iondon. Rotterdam and if condi
tions permit, will enter Belgium to
confer with the American members
of the commission now there.
Meanwhile the campaign to raise
relief funds will be continued in Am
erica. If there is no war between the
United States and Germany, this mon
ey will be distributed in lielginm dv
the Americans and in northern France
by Hollanders if Mr. Hoover is able
to make arrangements v.it'.i the Dutch
government. If war comes arrange
ments have been completed for Dutch
and Spanish agents in Belgium to
take over the work of the Americans.
Mr. Hoover pointed to the Belgian
"hprity administered by Great Britain
'nd France, also at war, eleclarins it
will be "one of the marvels of history
for they have handed to the commis
sion more than ninety percent of all
the money spent by the commission
!n feeding Beleians."
Of 20.000 Belgion refugees in Eng
'inil. Mr. Hoover declared, all except
15,000, mostly women and children,
ire employed and they are contribut
ing from their earnings $300,000
monthly.
"1 want particularly to emphasize
this point," he said, "because the Be'
o'ans are not hanging back without
' struggle and peimining themselves
r their friends to become depend
ents." .
"Europe is looking to us," he added.
'Our measure is being taken."
The Pneumonia Season.
The cold, damp weather of March
seems to be the most favorable for the
pneumonia germ. Now is the time to
he careful. Pneumonia often results
from a cold. The quicker a cold is got
ten rid of the less the danger. As soon
as the first indication jf a cold appears

HOUSE DEMOCRATS
PLAN CAUCUS FOR
SPEAKER APRIL 12
tl'.y Review Leasee! Wire)
WASHINGTON. Mar. 1:5 Another
series of conferences among Demo
cratic house leaders today resulted
in a call for a caucus here ou April 12
four clays before the opening of the
special session to line tin, Democratic
members lor the speakership fight.
The Republicans will caucus April 14"
and the five independents . who will
hoid the balance ef power, will con- '
fer at about the same time in a fur- "
ther effort to agree on some concert
?d. act ion. 1
Democratic Leader Kitchin talked
over the situation for three hours
with Speaker Clark. The caucus ca'l
sent out afterward contained an ur
gent request that every Utoc ratic
representative be present. The Re
publican representatives decided to
hold a conference on April 12 and
will take steps then to swing mem- ,
ters into line and clear 'he way for !
preliminaries for their caucus. ,
There still is much talk of a bi-par-!
tisan house organization but Mr.
Kitchin said they did not expect such
a plan to develop. Both Sneaker i
Clark and Republican Leader Mann '
candidates for the speakerships, are I
taking particular pains to avoii! any

fP.v Review Leased Wire.)
riTTSBUUG. Pa., Jlarch 13. Men -bers
of ihe railroad brotherhoods in
the Pittsburg district are said to have
received fcrma! 'order today to strike
on March 17 tinless otherw ise Tiotilicd.
The circular which also officially in
structs them as to their conduct dur
ing the strike. Is signed "Committee
D. of L. E., B of L. F.. O. C. B. of R. T."
The circular consists of seven num
bered paragraphs, the latest reading
as follows:
"Your representatives have been un
able to affect a satisfactory sitle
ment and a strike under the laws '.f
the respective organizations becomes
effective March 17. 1917, 7 p. m. cen
tral time, 7 p. m. eastern time, unless
otherwise notified."
The first paragraph directs that "no
turn In road service involved in the
strike will perform any service after
the hour set to strike unless he al
readv has begun a trip and has actual
ly left tli'- terminal. IT tlie train lias
left the terminal lie will complete the
trip and deliver the engine and tiain
at the end of the run or tie up point,
if lied up under the law, after which
lie will perform no further service i.ii
til the close ol the strike. Men in
Mther than road service will leave th
servii e at the appointed time. So tar
as your leual ru.ht to strike is con
cerned, there is no difference between
a mail tram and a I'rcight train. You
have identically the same right to re
fuse to pei form service on a mail
train as you have to refuse to perform
service on a freight train."
Other sections declare that "acts of
violence "jI any nature will not be
tolerated.

WASlIINCTON. March i:i. - Preli
minary report! to tlie treasury de

will collect i;'.iiil.OOit,iMtit 'in income
taxes durum the current liscal year,
or about two and one half times as
much as during the preceding 12
months. Internal revenue recipts are
e peeled to exceed fTuO.onn.niiO, ;in in
crease of nearly $2tto.00ii.(iO0.
The time for lilittg income returns
expired March 1. Most of the in
crease is due to the higher rate of
taxation. Collecti'.ms actually made
up to the present aggregate about
$2.r..ttoO.ioO or $7.(oil.OiM more than
was collected this time last ye:tr. The

approximately rW"".1"'" ' is thought,
while for tiie few months of the fiscal
year during which the fornu r emergen
cy tax law was in eil'ect the return:
will approximate Ji.Ti.OOo.ono on mis
cellaneous items affected by the tax.
Krom the Ordinary sources of in
ternal revenue whiskey, beer, tobac
co and olemargarine it is estimated
the tax this year will approximate
$350,000,000, the greatest total in the
history of the department. The su
preme court's decision sustaining the
Webb-Kenyon law will cause a diminu
tion, it is assumed in the returns
from whiskey and beer although thus
far the tax collected is considerably
higher than last year. A total of $?.T7.
000,000 has been collected from in
ternal revenue jf all sorts from the
beginning of the fiscal year up to the
present time. This is approximately
$250,000,000 more than last year.

one of the bitterest doses John Bull ever had to swallow.

Printing the Flag.
The Iowa department of justice has ruled that news
papers printing the American flag at the head of their
editorial columns or elsewhere are violating the federal
law which provides that no flag or representation of the
flag shall be primed or stamped on "any articie of mer
chandise." This is indeed a fearful and wonderful ruling. It ap
pears to have been made by an attorney general ratl.er
than a judge, and so fortunately lacks the validity of
court sanction; but it is difficult to see how anybody,
whether lawyer or layman, could take a view so patently
absurd.
Viewed in one aspect, a newspaper is indeed an "article
of merchandise"'. It is made to be sold. But anybody
who deliberately cias.ses a newpapei with a ham or aii
automobile tire or a barrel of beer ought to retire o a
vast solitude for a proloi.&cd period of meditation.
, If, when a newspaper prints a pi. -lure of the Hag. it jj
printing or stamping that Gag tn ai article of mcrchan
dise, then its wJiite paper is that article of merchaii'Ji if,
and a newspaper plaut is a factory engaged merely in
buying and selling white paper. That is the concl.isio,i
to whit-lf the Iowa decision leads. And if that is illegal,
why isn't it illegal to print the f.ag on white cotton clot;;,
as manufacturers do when they make real flags? It's th-
same mechanical process.
The fact is that a newspaper is no more a mere "article
of merchandise" than is a postage stamp or a marriage
license.
A newspaper is a body of information. It is a live
thing, with a mind and soul. It is an institution delving
definition and analysis. And it has as good a right to
print the American flag as a public speaker lias to de
scribe the flag or a poet has to write verses about it.
Very likely flag-dying has been a bit overdone lately
by some of our super-patriots, in the newspaper business
and out of it. But that's purely a question of taste. The
silly objections raised by Iowa lawyers have nothing to
do with it. Or if the Iowa verdict Is really law, then in
deed "the law is an ass."

Paper for Gold.
The United States treasury has decided to call in all
the gold coin which is underweight as a result of much
handling, and replace it with treasury notes. If this plan
is carried out, gold will disappear almost entirely from
circulation.
It isn't evident what the reason is for this change.
There is plenty of gold in the country, and from all iiidi
cations the supply is going to continue piling up. Never
was there less reason for substituting paper for gold, as
we have done in times past, and as the belligerent coun
tries of Europe have been forced to do during this war.
Possibly the plan is inspired by a diminishing demari'l tor
gold on the part of the general public. Most Americans
prefer paper, because it is lighter to carry and in many
ways easier to handle. But there is a large section of
the country that will not take kindly to any such substi
tution. In the "A'e::t, particularly the Rocky Mountain an"
Coast states, coin is almost universally preferred to

116 Sturdy Babies Ready for
Contest Which Opens Today
At High School Auditorium
If the sporting editor were writing
this he would probably claim that
"Chubby cherubs. In pink of condition,
await tap of gong." And if the so
ciety editor were presiding at the
typewriter, she would write some
thing like this; "The elite of young
America will assemble today for the
opening of the ui'ost talked of event
of the season, etc., etc.
But. as the writer is a confirmed
bachelor and knows little of babies
except that they are fond of milk and
always cry wnen they look at him,
the best he can do is to make the
plain statement that: the Better
Babies Contest will open at 10 o'clock
this morning in the high sel.'ool audi
torium under the auspices of tne civics
department of the Twentieth Century
Club, of this city.
Many Babies Entered.
One hundred and sixteen of the
sturdiest, liveliest and most noisy
babies in the Warren District have
been entered in the contest. Each
one of these babies has been "in train
ing" for the contest during the last
month and the parents of each are
confident that "our baby", being, of
course, the best baby in the w'orld,
will win first prize. Various black
eyes and swollen jaws carried around
yesterday by papas In Bisbee were
mute but indisputable evidence that
some of the young hopefuls had been
using their fathers for sparring part
ners in preparing for the event. A
baby's ability to hammer the day
lights out of his parents will not be
the only p'Jint in his favor, however.
Deportment, sight, hearing, chest ex
pansion, and even the shape of baby's
head and condition of his or her
teeth will be taken into consideration
in awarding the prizes.
LAST PERFORMANCE
OF FARNUM TONIGHT
i
i
"The Price of Silence" To Ap
pear at the Orpheum To
night for Last Time.
Guffaws of hearty laughter rent the
tense silense ' Which attended the
showing of "The Price of Silence,"
which appears for the last time at the
Orpheum tonight, the William Fox
film production, to the city officials
of Los Angeles, Cal., when the 'senate
chamber scene was flashed "jn the
screen.
A. Carlos, general western repre
sentative of the Fox Film Corporation,
who had arranged the presentation,
was shocked. He looked hard at the
film, hoping to catch the "break"
which caused the uproarious outbreak
Failing in tfiistie waited until the end
of the show. Then he asked several
of the guardians of the city's fate:
"Why?"
By picking up a few w'jrds here and
there from the new outburst of "haw
haws," Mr Mr. Carlos was finally able
to get the cause of the laushter. The
senate chamber scene shown in the
film was taken in the actual senate
chamber of the California legislature
at Sacramento. The session was ad
adjourned temporarily to make room
for the actors, but many of the sen
ators stayed ai'ound. by request, to
fill out the scene. The sight of fami
liar senatorial figures strutting about
on the film was too much, even for
the dignity of Los Angeles officials
when guests of a great film company.
The seriousness with which the Cal
ifornia Solons played their parts as
supers in the film added to 'the hun'jr.
several of the city rulers explained.

little rascals who giggle upon the
slightest provocation; some are slen
der and serious; some are fluffy haired
and some have very little hair; some
are lively and excitable and some are
as quiet and calm -as judges, but all
in all, they are about as fine a crowd
of little boys End girls as could be
found anywhere.
EVANGELIST. WARNS
AUDIENCE OF HELL
An impressive sermon was preached
last night by Dr. Hart, his subject be
ing "Hell". He said, in part: "Our
God is a God of love and tenderness,
and since He is t. He must warn
men against the punishment prepared,
not for men, but 'for the devil and his
angels.'
"There is not the first principle in
the thought that ail will be saved.
He is a God of justice, and as such,
it is Impossible to save the unrepent
ant sinner. Shall we people of the
I'nited States turn loose the two hun
dred and eighty thousand criminals in
our penitentiaries? Many people say
there is no hell, tut it is better to
be albne with God than with a crowd
without Him.
"The only way to be sure is to go
to the Bible. That unanswerable book
speaks of Heaven and hell in the same
vrrse, so how can we accept one anil
reject tiie other? Christ used every
conceivable term iv describe this'
place, in order to portray its awful
ness. He called it a place of torment,
'where the worm.dieth not, and the
fhirst is not quenched.' Hell is a
place of memory, of unfulfilled desire,
of taunting, of shame and of remorse.
"The God of love presents the tJ
paths to us, and closes His great book
with the invitation. 'The Spirit and
the Bride Say Come." And let him
that heareth say. come. And let him
that is athirst come, and whomsoever
will, let him take the water of life
freely."

ROY-ED NOT IN U. S,
DESPITE RUMORS
(By Review Leased Wire)
PHILADELPHIA, March 13. Sto
ries published here today that Captain
Karl Boy-iCd, former naal attache at
the German embassy at Washington,
was in this city as recently as a week
ago and linking his name with the al
leged smuggling plot involving the
two interned German commerce raid
ers at the Philadelphia navy yard,
were dt-Uared tonight to be without
foundation t'jday by Frank Garbarino,
head of the local bureau of investiga
tion of tne federal department ot
justice.
Agents of the department were giv
$i as authority for the stories which
were to Hie effect that Captain Boy-Ed
had come here presumably to visit a
young woman prominent in s'ocial cir
cles in Philadelphia and Washington,
to whom he had been reported en
gaged prior to his dismissal from this
country in December, 1D13.
Garbarino said there was absolute
ly nothing on which to base such state
ments and denied emphatically that
either he or his assistants had givt n
out such iiuoniiati'jn. either privately
or for publication. "The stories are
ridiculously on their face," declared
Garbarino.
Despondency Due to Constipation.

BRAZILIAN TRADE
GIVEN BY MORGAN
(By Review Leased Wire).
BOSTON. March 13. American
business nit n can best increase their
trade with Lrai.il by sending agents
who tpeak the native language and b
carefully avoiding sending substittu
matter in tilling Brazilian orders. Ld
v in V. Morgan, ambassador to that
South American republic said at a
luncheon given Ly the Boston cham
ber of commerce today.
Mr. Morgan particularly emphasized
the point that, it would be better iV
American business in nencral to .
luse orders from Brazilian import"
than to send materials not in e..
accordance with spec ilieations. Oth
products that Brazil ami ed to develoi
have mentioned cattle, cocoamit o,

THE BISBEE DAILY REVIEW, WEDNESDAY MORNING, MARCH 14, 1917.
Mining and Financial News
BY REVIEW
NEW YORK. Mar. 13.-Tendencies
recently manifested by the stock mar
ket in the direction of hiyher levels
were halted today by the turn of
events in the controversy between the
railway brotherhoods and railway
managers. The reported attitude of
the labor unions was the more sur
prising and disconcerting from the
fact that the financial community had
been led to believe of the existence
of a temporary working agreement
between the opposing interests. lljil
way shares yielded 1 to 2 points on
l he moderate offerings.
Later when dealings dwindled to
iusiguiticant 'proportions prices made
gradual but v ry complete recoveries
jii-lul liiir a few noteworthy gains, due
mainly to short covering. Not a few
traders acted upon a time worn prov
erb of the street that it is most haz
ardous to "sell a market; on strike de
velopments." v
As usual U.S. Steel which closed
at a slight fractional advance, fur
nished a very large proportion of the
day's business, with coppers, ship
pines. Central Leather, and a few oth
er war and semi-war specialties.
Sties 520,0(10 shares. International
bonds- moved within extremely nar
row limits on light offerings and most
domestic. issues were irregular. Total
sales, par value. $3.12.";.0n0.
U. S. bonds were unchanged on call
but the coupon 4"s fell a half percent
and registered 4's half percent on ac
tual sales. '
(By L. J. Overlook
NEW YORK. M.tr. 1?.. The rails
continued more or less soft in the
afternoon but the industrials picked
up strength and sold during the af
ternoon at or around or above the
previous close. The day's market
confirmed everything that has been
said about, its fundamental strength
inasmuch as a railway strike scare
produced nothing resembling demor
alization but only a moderate reac
tion and dullness in the trading. The
strike matter tends to restrict opera
tions and we will probably see a nega
tive or waiting market for a few days.

Almost ever;'.)r.e knows thut Sae '
Tea and Sulphur, properly compound
ed, brings Lack the natural color and
lustre to the hair when faded, streaked
or gray. Years ago the oniy way to
set this mixture was to" make it at
home, which is mussy and trout le
sonie. Nowadays we simply ask at any drug
store for "Wyeth's Sage and Sulphur
CV'.npound." You will get a large botch-
of this old recipe improved by the
addition of other ingredients for about
50 cents. Everybody uses this prepara
cion now, because no one can possibly
tell that you darkened your hair, :is .
it does it sV naturally and evenly. Yen
dampen a sponge or soft brush with it
and draw this through your hair, tak-,
ing one small strand at a time: by
morning the gray hair disappears, ami '
after another application or two, your
hair becomes beruMIully dark, thick
3nd glossy and you U,ok years younger.
Wyeth's Sage and Sulphur Co-npound
is a delightful toilet rer,ui::ite. It is
not intended for the cure, uiitigatiou ;
or prevention of disease.

LIKE ELECTRIC
BUTTON ON TOES
Fells why a corn is so painful
and Says Cutting Makes
them grow.
Press nn electric button and von
."orm a contact with a live wire which
'rings the bell. When your shoes press
igiinst your corn it pushes its
sns-rp roots down upon a sensitive
nerve and you get a shock of pain.
Instead of trimming your corns,
which merely makfs them grow, just
-tep into any drag store and ask for a
quarter of an ounce of freez'jne. This
ill cost very little but is sufficient to
remove every hard or soft corn or cal
lus from one's feet. A few drops ap
plied directly upon a tender, aching
coin stops the soreness instantly, and
.Jjn the corn shrivels up so it lifts
.-ight out. root and all, without pain,
'his dnii; is harmless and never in
lat:'.es or even irritates the surround
ni tis ue or skin. (Advertisement)
