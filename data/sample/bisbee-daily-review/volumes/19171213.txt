The president's motives in drawing
distinctions between Germans and

rnism of those who have been confi -
dent that the drive would be checked
within its present limits.
The weather up to now had been
almoy unprecedentedly fine every
where in northern Italy, a condition
ecked
which by peculiar anomaly has favor
ed the invaders almost exclusively,
since the elements have presented
none of their customary obstacles.
The cloudless skies have made pos
sible unlimited aerial reconnoitering
and the starry, moonlight nights have
rendered difficult the substitution of
Ften-h for Italian iroops.
Air and Guns.
The fighting between the French
and Austro-Germans has been limited
thus far chiefly to aerial and artillery
engagements, which have been father
of a tentative nature. Both sides have
taken advantage ef the fine cloudless
weather to keep squadrillas a the air
scouting from dawn to dark, and air
battles have been almost hourly oc
currences. ' . .
The eGrmans have unquestioned
strategic advantages because of their
possession of the crest of Mount Tbm
ba. The mountains now held by the
Germans are nearly the last of the big
peaks, but below the 'stretching for
solid rows for miles behind the front,
is a series of peculiarly shaped bills',
each trom a few hundred to a thous
and feet high, which make the finest
imaginable defenses and which would
have to be stormed individually and
at great cost, unless the line to the
west should give way.
Defense Stopped.
The French appear in a position to
arrest any German advance for an in
definite period if the Italians continue
to resist the Austro-German onslaught.
The Italians themselves express the
greatest confidence that their troops
will succeed in checking an Austro
German advance there.
The French already have acclimated
themselves perfectly and appear to be
working in the utmost harmony with
such of the Italians that are left on
their sectors, notably with artillery,
which co-operates under joint com
mand. The French as well as the
British armies have brought with
them the most complete equipment
imaginable, including a bewildering
number of motor trucks, so that their
lines may be supplied with every ne
cessity. Scene Behind Front.

! railroads, the president was told, even
if his plan is government operation,
strongly urged by many of his advis
ers. The railroads, however, the
war board made clear, are of the
opiniou that they themselves can meet
the situation ifr given time. They re
gard as their first need a centraliza
tion of control of government troffic
in the hands of a federal traffic mana
ger. Priority orders without number
coming from various government de
partments, they said, are doing more
to slow up freight movement than any
other single factor.
Want No Loan.
The railroads, it was reiterated, are
not seeking a government loan or a re
peal of anti-pooling laws. They be
lieve that measures already taken for
the common use oA equipment and
trackage will bring relief from conges
tion, though government approval of
railroad credit will be necessary if
the roads are to raise capital that will
be needed next year.
After seeing the war board members
the president received the executive
representatives of th four railroad
brotherhoods, who came to Washing
ton to urge that there be no repeal
of legislation assuring the safety of
railroad workmen. The railroad men
.were particularly concerned over re
ports that congress might be asked to
repeal full crew and safety appliance
acts.
Th,e representatives, were:' H. E.
Wills, of the engineers; P. J. McNam-
ara, of the firemen; W. M. Clark, of
the conductors, and W" M. Doak, of
the trainmen.
Roads Working Hard.
The president was told by members
of the war board of steps already
taken by the operating committee of
eastern executives to clear choked
terminals. These measures, the war
board said, already are showing re
sults, and if given time, the roads can
put traffic on a ba?is as nearly nor
mal as possible considering the great
amount of freight they are asked to
transport.
Attention was called to the roads'
recommendation of a month ago that
the government deny transportation
to more than 500 commodities classed
as non-essentials. An order of this
character, the president's callers in
sisted, would have to be issued event
pally, whoever operates the roads,
since there is more traffic than can
be moved.
Locomotives Sent East.
Orders transferring 100 locomotives
from western lines to the east were
made public tonight by the war board.
The engines will be started east with
in the next 24 hours. They will be
used by the more heavily, burdened
lines and will be furnished by the
western lines in proportion to the
number each owns.
Announcement tonight from New
York that the eastern operating com
mittee had declared an embargo oil
export freight except for government
supplies was hailed by war board
members as one of the most effective
mov3s made yet toward relieving con
gested conditions.

The chancellor said that when the
last vote was moved, on October 30th,
for 400,000.000 pounds, it was suppos
ed that this sum would meet the ex
penditures until the first week in Jan
uary. That has been realized and it
now was estimated that this credit
would last until January ninth. The
average daily expenditure for 63 days
preceding-December 1st was 16,794,

over the budget estimate of 1,383,000
pounds daily.
Total Excess.
The , total excess over the budget
estimate was 309,000.000 pounds. But
from that was to be deducted the ex
penditure which bad been recovered
or was recoverable and he estimated
that sum at 225.000,000 pounds. There
fore the excess over the estminte of
the dcily expenditure was 350,000
pounds. i
One of the causes of the increased
army expenditure; said the chancellor,
was the increase in the aviation pro

number of troops employed in Mesopo

and Palestine. The estimate of thej(0 tj,e Munich

While the house ehould not exag

most certain that there would be a
stable government in Russia and he
could not believe that efforts which
the Russian people had made to es
tablish freedom and a free govern
ment would end in anything but the
establirhedment of a recognized re

;anT infantry advance,
j -Assaulting waves of Bavarian
! troops came over in close formation. It
ivas the manifest intention to throw
j great pressure upon the front of the
i attack and overpower tae aeienaers.
j the German managed to get some sort
j of a footing in about 500 yard of our
fi'jnt line trenches before their at
tack was arrested.
"The artillery fire continued until
about 1:30 o'clock, when it died
down, but the constant rattle of ma-
hine guns suggested that some f iicht-
ing was still inprogre.-s. and it is
quite possible that we were counter
attacking.
"This is really all there is to tell.
It seems reasonable to believe that the
Germans failed in their project, since
the extent of their gain was sa small
achievement that it is difficult t'j re-
; both sides would be settled into winter
quarters."
BRITISH OFFICIAL
LONDON. Dec. 12. The German at
tack this morning east of Bullecourt
was repulsed by the British except at

length of front trench, which formed

"At all other points the attack was
repulsed with heavy loss to the en

our wire. A number tf prisoners were
captured.
"The enemy's artillery has been ac
tive during the day in the area of his
attack and has shown some activity
south of Lens and in the neighborhood

CANADIAN OFFICER
WILL SPEAK BEFORE
TWO MOjiE MEETINGS
After Successful Meeting Last
Night Recruiting Officer
Announces Two Meetings
In Bisbee for Today.
LIEUT. CROZIER
Of. the Canadian Expeditionary Force,
who tells, again today, some reasons
why the war should and must be pros
ecuted to a successful issue for the
allied nations.
Appreciation in high degree was the
portion of Lieut. A. J. Croxier and
Sgt. A. Blinman, Canadian expedition
ary recruiting officers, who appeared
at the Y. M. C. A. last evening and
who talked to a crowded and interert
ed audience for the better patt of
twx hours. This afternoon the two sol
diers will again appear at the Y. M.
C. A. auditorium for the purpose of giv
ing the night shift men and their
friends an opportunity to hear their
message. Thise vening thetwo men
wiUtalk to the Elks and their fam
ilies at the Elks' home at 8 o'clock.
Lieut. Crozler was introduced by
Mayor Jacob Erickson to the audience.
Besides the Canadian officer ana toe
mayor, Sgt Blinmann and the United
States naval recruiting officer were
alone on the platform.
Starting in with a display of tro
phies of every sort and character and
the flags of every part of the grea
British empire, now aiding the mother
country in the defense of its national
ity, Lieut, Crozier told some mighty in
teresting stories and facts regarding
service in Europe.
He was followed, after a few min
utes, by Sgt. Blinman, who talked of
bis 20 months' service on the fighting
Lifles in France and eBlgium..
Lieut Crozier again took the floor
and told why Canada was loyal. ' The
officer's exponiUon of the reasons for
the intnse royalty of the dominion to
the British empire was convincingly
and clearly set forth. He would jump
from pathos to comedy and his audi
ence, of which 25 per cent were Brit
ish subjects or their descendants,
listened attentively to his words. His
talk was an argument for loyalty and
for sen ice. His talk was a convinc
ing speech on the need of a greater
and better co-operation between the
vari'jus forces for good in the United
States.
On Friday morning Lieut. Crozier
will leave for Clifton and MorencL
From the Greenlee county towns he
will go to Blobe and then to Phoe
nix. He is the officer in charge of the
recruiting service of the state of Ari
zona. Today's and this evening's meet
ing will be the last held in the War
ren district

That Congressional
Investigation
Congressional decision to investigate the war de
partment Is welcome news to every good and patriotic
citizen of thia land, resardless of party or partisanship.
There is no charge against the war" department It may
be doing Its level best, and it may even be efficient. But
the country wants to KNOW! It wants to be sure! We
cannot afford to take rhances.. There has been a lot
of talk of unnecessary delay In furnishing needed equip
ment There have been complaints about many things.
They may be groundless or unjust But a rigorous Invest
igation of the ordnance and arms and ammunition and
equipment departments of the government at this time
may well save a disaster next summer.
The war department has the biggest job on its hands
that any American system or organization has ever under
taken. Its ordinary task has been multiplied, not doubled.
Hundreds of new office employes had to be broken in and
trained. A labor shortagle is general over the nation.
Transportation and fuel prpb ferns have to be
met But even with these handicaps and trials the war
department must still make good If we are to make a
creditable showing In Europe next year. Creditable!
Wait a minute. NECESSARY is the w;ord to use here,
not "creditable." ;
; We MUST make good over there next summer.
The war department mast not only be handled effi
ciently and well. It must perform miracles. It must do
the impossible and work overtime and be conducted" by
the best man or men in the nation.
Military officials In "power in Washington may be
competent and they may not be. Only the test of war
can determine a military man's real standing. The
peace time head of a department may fall woefully short
of war requirements.
A congressional investigation will determine these
things. No patriotic congressman will allow partisanship'
or politics to enter into this investigation at all. It Is
imperative that prejudice and littleness have no part In
this important matter. A coalition cabinet often spoken
of lately, may result from this investigation.
Wilson Is a great president He has proved It many
times, But the world knows his cabinet is the weakest
the country has had since George Washington won the
battle of Yorktown. And especially so in the navy and
war portfolios, the most Important in time of war. If the
gentlemen who head these departments have risen to the
emergency and excelled themselves and gone beyond their
speed and struck harder than their strength, well and
good. It will be grand news to announce to the nation
at large.
But If there is weakness and confusion and lack of
unusual ability In handling these vast problems, ftien
the right men should be called to the task. The greatest
man in America is not too great to be secretary of war
at this time. The one man in a million is required to
head the ordnance department. Artillery is our greatest
weakness. Millions npon millions Jiave been entrusted
by congress for the war and navy departments to spend.
Therefore it Is the duty of congress to require an ac
counting of money, whieh is valuable, and of time, which
is more valuable still, and of efficiency, which is priceless.
The war department's censorship of uews has been
about as silly a-thlng as red tape ever perpetrated npon
a long suffering constituency. The lack of equipment
gives rise to grave suspicions. The lack of definite In
formation arouses fears for the worst. There are many
able men In congress, and their probe In this matter will
either result in a complete reorganization of the depart
ments, under Investigation or tend greatly to reassure
the nation that its war is being handled as well as human
hands and brains and h"xts ran handle It. Nothing less
will pass muster at this time and in this war where great
masses of men and material must be handled with all
tlie precision and Fpecd that small masses were handled
before.
STEWING ABOUT THE SOLDIERS.
(Collitr's Weekly.)
The sudden assembling of our new national army was
a real inspiration to those well-known scandal mongers
Cliadband, Grundy, Partington, Pecksnifr and company.
Such members of young men, all young! living practically
outdoors! eating largely of gross food! gaining ten or fif
teen pounds apiece! Think of it! What utter brutish
ness. No woman would be safe within miles of them,
and fancy bow any uniform fascinates the girls! Oh,
dear! oh, slush! And so on ad nauseam. A New York
lawyer who haa done good service in detecting real crime
mislaid her judgment ao far as to repeat some of these
fantasies as facts, and has been issuing qualifying state
ments ever since.. One writer tells In a popular maga
zine of the British soldier shaving daily in Uie trenches,
currying horses, and polishing harness each night after
hours in the Flanders mud all which should prove some
thing as to his morale. Eut (oh, the shame of it!) when
these fellows get to town they eit jammed thick all over
taxicabs and whirl through the streets with snout and
song. The remaining depths of iniquity are plumbed in
the dark statement that 10 per tent of the men who go
to Paris on leave have bitter cause to regret it after
wards. If our sad friend would consult the medical men
who lecture on such subjects, he would find that his sup
posed indictment proves for Uie camps a higher level of
male-sex morality than has ever been known of today in
any lare city. This notion that peace is chaste while
soldiering is the reverse has no basis of fact The aver
age soldier is' kept fairly busy In war times, and he has
more to think about than the gossips have any Idea of.
Also, the modern camp is not lacking means for recrea
tion (the T. M. C. A. and the K. of C. are co-operating to
thiB end). The real trouble with Chadband, Grundy,
Partington, Pecksniff and company t is' that they have
framed up an eleventh commandment viz.. Thou shall
not enjoy life," and the young fellows are awfully slow
about tacking it on to the Decalogue. Our guess is that
they never will.
"I expect to spend as much money for Christmas this
year as I did last year," declared a Bisbee citizen yester
day, "but I am going to buy only useful and substantial
presents, excepting, of course, some toys for my kiddles.
But I will reduce even my toy purchases in favor of gifts
that are worth while." This is the practical and com
mon sense spirit to show this year. We can be happy
and do good and observe the wonderful day and still
serve our country when she needs so many things, if we
will use good judgment in our selection and our expenditures.
While there is not so much fuss about.it now as in
the beginning, yet German spies and agents are being ar
rested every day in this country by federal agents. The
ordinary plain and average citizen Is Uie main dependence
of the government in getting a clew to the identity of
these spies and enemies. It is your duty, and mine, Mr.
Citizen, -and Madame Citiness, to communicate to the au
thorities any information that comes to our hand re
garding the activity or treasonable utterances of any
of these pacifists wha are a disgrace to their native coun
try, and these German and Austrian agents who would
betray the country of their adoption and their freedom
and the prosperity and happiness. A little thing or a
small word may lead to Uie apprehension of a big spy
or the discovery of a big plot . Whatever our inclination,
It is our duty to consider these things and act upon them.
"Next to the war and the opening of congress, the
most important event of the week was the report of the
Interstate Commerce Commission," declares, Henr;
Clews, Uie New York banker. "While merely suggestivt
the report was unexpectedly liberal, although not satis
factory in all respects. It recommended that congress
suspend the anti-pooling and anti-trust laws, except in
cases of competing roads; extend government loans to
roads when needed, and to regulate security issues. The
report was disappointing in that It falle dto provide for
increased rates, and suggested government operation as
an alternative. The whole question will be thrown into
congress and will probably be the subject of more or less
strenuous discussion. Unquestionably thg bent plan
would be: unity of operation; a pooling system; neces
sary loans with government guarantee, and such advance
In rates as might be deemed necessary to at least parltal
ly offset Increased expenses."
Merchants In the Warren District declare that in spite
of the governmental appeal to conserve labor by tarrying
purchases home, that both men and women here are
ordering small parcels delivered at their doors. Women
who take a leading part in war benefit work go to a
store and order little things sent out In Uie same old way.
In other words, the delivery problem is as great now In
the district as it was before the national need was set
before the people. The only real and true patriotism
is the kind that is patriotic In little as well as in big
things. Many little things make the big ones. If one
man goes without meat or wheat for a day, that amounts
to practically nothing, but when a city, a Taic. abstains
from meat or wheat a grand fotal Is acccomplished. ,W it
tiess the case of Los Angeles, where one meatless day
was estimated to have saved $160,0(10 worth of meat loi
the soldiers who are fighting the Hun. If a million peo
ple carry their purchases home, tiiat means vast
amount of labor and equipment conserved for war pur-

Questionaires Are Now Being
Mailed Out and It is Up to
Registrants to See That
They Get Their's at Once.
The local board at Tombstone has
begun to mail out the questionaires so
that the men In Cochise county will
have plenty of time to fill them out
and to study them over. The question
aires are dated December 15th and the
drafted men will have seven days to
fill them out and return them
from that date. A ..number of the
questionaires have already been re-
lirait In Riuhoo and nthers will arrive
during the next few days and Uie regis
tered men should see mat mey ge:
theirs as soon as possible. Failure to
return the questionaire within seven
days makes the registrant liable to
punishment by a fine or Imprisonment
for one year and may result in the loss
of valuable rights and in immediate in
duction into military service.
Every man in the county who Is
registered will receive one and ony
man who has been registered but who
is not wearing the uniform in the serv
ice must fill out the questionarie.
It is up to each ' individual to ac
quaint himself with every one of the
requirements affecting registered men
and to carry 'out every letter of the
law. Having been rather lenient with
transgressors of the first draft, simply
because the government wished to
give the man the benefit of the doubt

ENGLAND'S COTTON
INDUSTRY PROSPERS
DESPITE OBSTACLES
MANCHESTER, Eng. The Lanca
shire cotton industry again is com
paratively pi'jspcrous in spite of war ,
cime ditficultics. The cotton control
board, says the Manchester Guardian. '
M-ems to have steered the industry ;
salely through crisis unprecedented in
its history, three mouths ago the cot
ton mills ol Lancashire, which de
pended upon a supply ot American cot
ton, saw the stocks of coyMn dwindling
unul at last the supply was estimated
to be sufficient only to keep the mills
active for a few weeks. The regula
tions of the control board have
materially improved the situation
and it is asserted that if the existing
stock could be maintained there
would be n'j need of anxiety for the fu-j
ture of the industry.
Hut the cotton position docs not re
main h table. Cotton shipment during
the past two months have been fairly
satisfactory but each week shows a
decrease in I he amount of tonnage anu
this is bound to be reflected in the
amount l cotton reaching Liverpool.
For these reasons the prospi-ct ot a
serious set back is considered by no
means remote. Therefore, the trade
cannot look forward to freedom from
government control at the end 'jf the
present mcntli. This was the period
fixed by the control ooarc ror the
expiration of .he plan to restrict the
output in order to conserve the supply.

The process of heating water for domestic purposes has been rev- (
olutionized in the past few years through the introduction and
perfection of gas fired water heaters, until today it is no longer a
a problem to secure an abundance of hot water quickly and econo
mically, in any dwelling, large or small.
Today, in the countless thousands of homes where gas fired water heaters are in
stalled, an abundance of hot water is available for any purpose. By some types of heat
ers the water is heated instantly at the turn of a faucet, by others, within a few min
utes after lighting the heaters, and all without labor, inconvenience or discomfort, ind
at a reasonable cost for gas.

CHICAGO GRAIN.
CHICAGO, Dec. 12. Unfavorable
weather conditions made corn prices
average, higher today, But there was
persistent commission houses selling
on the bulges. The market closed
unsettled. January $1.21 tnd May
51.19. with the final range as a
whole Varying from '-ic off to c ad
vance, compared with twenty four
hours before. The outcome in oats
was a gain of c to 2c.
Provisions declined 25c. o 30c.
Prevalent low temperatures, storms
and a new cold wave in sight ren
dered the prospect adverse to any
likelihood of immediate substantial
enlargement of corn receipts. The
difficulties of efficient railroad opera
tion under such circumstances and
with an inadequate car supply tended
until nearly mid-day to reduce offer
ings to a minimum and to1 bring about
moderate advance in prices.
During the last part of the session,
however, considerable aggressiveness
developed on the selling side of the
market, and there was a correspond
ing reaction of values.
Oats ascended to new high price
records for the season. Meagreness
of receipts acted as the chief bullish
factor. Besides export demand by
way of the gulf, cut a figure.
Provisions sagged to general neglect.

"Let me say, most emphatically.
that neither American agriculture nor
Industry can possibly progress beyond
the capacity of the transportation fa
cilities of the nation to handle tbeir
raw materials and their products.
When you stop railroad expansion in
a country of such distances, popula
tion, industrial and agricultural ac
tivities as ours, you automatically set
a dead limit to the expansion of com
merce and production.
"As one of the chief of the under
lying causes which have been sap
ping our resources of transportation
I would name the continued failure to
provide an adequately remunerative
basis of rates. The direct effect or
this error has been to make it diffi
cult to raise and sustain sufficient
capital for the improvements and ex
tensions which are sorely needed. In
the mania for restricting the charges
for transportatlen the financial possi
bility of permanently maintaining
quality of service seems to have been
overlooked. Aside from military con
siderations, we. In the railroad indus
try, know from personal observation
that what the public and industries
need is service, rather than the sav
ing of a fraction of a mill per ton
mile. We know that there are many
shippers in this country today who
would gladly pay more than the es
tablished rates to have their com
modities moved promptly and regu
larly. The operating results and the
net returns of the railroads for many
years show there has been a constant
rise In expenses and taxes, and de
creasing return on the investment in
road and equipment.

for oil Everyday Mr. Edwards sees substantial check, go into the treasury of the ARIZONA OIL A REFINING COMPANY for every day
Honorable David F. Johnson, the state treasurer of Arizona, deposits more money to the credit of the ARIZONA OIL & REFINING COM
PANY The money and equipment which this company now has on hand assures the drilling will start at once. -
When you read the announcements which we are making to sell these shares when you find offices opened by us throughout the state
when vou meet salesmen who are selling these shares it naturally occurs to you who pays for this? WE PAY FOR IT. There is not
MMr"llhrSi V on the selling campaign against 'the ARIZONA OIL i REFINING COMPANY. The company i. not se.l
ina its stock. We have yet to find a company who is a success today who dabbled in their own financing who sold their own stock. The
STANDARO OIL COMPANY-THE UNION OIL COMPANY THE MASCOT OIL COMPANY THE UNITED STEEL CORPORATION
all these great financial giants went to some brokerage house and had their stock underwritten.
An oil company should be an oil company and not a brokerage company. What man is there who understands the oil game who understands
financing? And who ever knew of a geologist who was a business man who could handle finances? Did you ever know of a business man
whojwas a geologist? Every man in his place every business for that particular business. The people of Arizona are appreciating the
unique situation of the organization of the ARIZONA OIL & REFINING COMPANY the money is being handled by the treasurer Hon
arable David F. Johnson Mr. Johnson isn't selling any shares he doesn't know how, but he does know how to handle the finances of any
company of any state. Mr. Edwards the noted geologist is managi ing director of the ARIZONA OIL & REFINING COMPANY he
doesn't know how to sell stock but he does know oil and oil refining for he has made millions of dollars for the people of California
he has made millions of dollars foe the tSandard Oil and if the people of Arizona will keep Mr. Edwards in his place and will back his
judgment on the Chino Valley oil fields and let him have charge of the drilling operations the selection of property he will make some
;iuii9ina 9ii umii millions for the investors of Arizona. .
The stock selling is In our hands for we know how to sell shares we don't want to handle the drilling
we don't want to handle the expenditures for drilling and equipment but we know how to buy advertis
ing space we know how to select agents we know how to properly present a proposition we charge
for our services the laborer is worthy of his hire and if we are not worth every dollar that we get out
of the sale of stock the ARIZONA OIL & REFINING COMPANY are wflcome to place the sale of the
shares through another organization.
We don't make tremendous profits we haven't cashed in on this proposition as we have today settled
for over 100,000 shares which we haven't sold and are not offering and will not offer except at a very
.much higher figure.

regulating authorities of a responsi
ble and unified policy of fair treat
ment In the matter of freight rates.
The government is allowing reason
ble prices and profits to industry;
why not to the railroads?
'"Such a policy, and not the loan of
government credit, would, under nor
mal conditions, be a permanent solu
tion for the problem of railroad cred
it. I do not wish to be understood as
saying that a government loan might
not be a desirable expedient if. under
war conditions, the entire capital
market is to be absorbed by the gov
ernment. But it should be regarded
as an expedient only, justifiable, if at
all, as an emergency measure.
"The war is, to a great extent, re
sponsible for the present congestion
of traffic and its movement out of
normal channels, but the carriers
would now be far better able to cope
with this condition if they had re
ceived more liberal treatment in the
matter of rates during the past, at a
time when they could have marketed
securities and financed improvements
while labor and materials were rea
sonable in cost, and the supply of
:both adequate. The end of expansion
and Improvements on railroads is tho
beginning of decay and the letting
down of the standards of service. The
lack of a sympathetic attitude toward
the railroads in governmental quar
ters has unquestionably led to appre
hension as to the future of their se
curities, and this, I personally be
lieve, if not corrected, will ultimately
affect the credit of the government
itself.
J "Notwithstanding prevailing high
i prices and the difficulty of getting
I capital, it Is imperative that prompt
I measures be taken to give4 the rail
' roads relief from the present over
j crowding of facilities and a poor ln
I vestment return. Nothing could be
' more helpful to the country in these
' trying times than the adoption of a
j broader, a more liberal and unified
policy of regulation. The railroads
are the great reliance of the public
' and the country. The public owns
them. Public ownership is not a pos
sibility; it is a fact,
i "The energies of ouj country and
! its railroads are being devoted prl
I marily to an international service and
1 danger theatenlng the life of the na
' tion and the world. The day ' for a
small policy and slow action has gone.
The railroads have subordinated their
interests and activities; the citizens
and our courts are ready for a larger
and more equitable policy, and the
president and congress should with
out delay recognize that fact and or
der that an equitable basis or railroad
revenues be instituted at once, which
will encourage investors to retain
their securities and do their share in
providing the capital which can be
spared as the government demands
are met from time to time. We roust
get away from the present line of
confiscatory return for an equitable
return on the investment devoted to
public use. The statistics are at hand
to emphasize what the returns mmt
be; all that Is required is the requi
site courage to enact the foXicj In
regulation and legislation."

For Practical Gifts Buy Silverware
When one thinks of Christmas they naturally think of good
jewelry. You can't go wrong if you select jewelry here, and she
wouldn't stick up her nose at a Diamond Ring, a lovely Bracelet, a

ware for her table, and it always appeals to her feminine sense of fit
ness. In short, a mere man may buy it here safely, for her liking.
