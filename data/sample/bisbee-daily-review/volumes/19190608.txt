NEW YORK, June 7. The nation
wide strike of telegraph and telephone
operators, ordered 'by S. J. Konen
kamp, international president of the
Commercial Telegraphers' union, "will
amount to nothing," according to a
statement tonight" by Newcomb Carl
Jon, head of tho Western Union Tele

"The Western Union would like to
assure the public that there will be
no delay in handling their messages,"
said Mr. Carlton. "We will maintain
a full force at all our offices and. the
small number of union employes who
obey the strike call will not affect the
character of .our- service or its con
tinuity." Disregarding the south, where be
said only, 300 of 12.000 employes were
on strike Mr. Carlton declared exten
sion of the 'walkout to the rest of the
country would bring few recruits to
the ranks of the strikers.'
Mr. Carlton said the company had
questioned all Its employes as to
whether they would obey the call and
that 147 out of 28,000 in the territory
to which the strike was to be extend
ed had replied they would walk out.
These had been discharged, Mr. Carl
ton said, not because they were union
men, but because they had said they
would quit when directed to do so by
Konenkamp.
The strike will have no effect on

Mystery Veils
Missing Bronze
Capitol Tablet
PHOENIX, June 7. A $300
bronze tablet bearing the names
of former governor Hunt, the for
mer commission of state insti
tutions, and the building superin
, tendent, which originally was in
tended for a decoration at the
entrance of the capitol addition,
has disappeared, according to
statements today by Andrew Bau
mert, present, chairman of the
commission of state institutions,
and J. C. Crisman, building sup
erintendent. Baumert said that it is very un
likely that the tablet would have
been used, but that it was state
property, paid for by the state,
and that he, wants it returned at
once. He added that' if nobody
else could find it, perhaps the
sheriff could.
Crisman, who Is in charge of
construction on the capitol addi
tion, . said that the tablet was
stored in the construction ware
house and that he had not looked
at it for a month, but that today
he happended into the warehouse
and discovered that the big plate
was missing. The lost piece of
bronze weighs 250 pounds, said
Crisman, and he is certain that
no one could have carried it off.
Further, he said, he believed it
could not have been removed
during the day.
"I do not accuse anybody," said
Crisman, "but I wish whoever
took it would bring it back."

Alleged $30,000,000 Swindle
In Sale Of Army Supplies
Unearthed By U. S. Probe
.
Detroit Millionaire, Chief
Finance Officer Of U. S.
Ordnance Bureau 'Arrested
DETROIT, June 7. With the arrest
here today of four men, one of them
an army officer, department of jus
tice agents disclosed an alleged con
spiracy to defraud the government In
the sale of $30,000,000 worth of army
supplies to be salvaged here.
The United States grand jury has re
turned indictments, it was announced,
against Capt Solerios Nicholson of
Washington, chief finance officer of
the ordnance department, for thia dis
trict, an unnamed army officer recent
ly sent to France in connection with
the disposal of excess supplies; Grant
Hugh Browne, a millionaire sportsman
and race track owner of Detroit, and
Fred S. Collins, vice-consul for Greece
and president of a local realty com
pany.
All but the officer in France .togeth
er with Bert Harris, a junk dealer of
New York, are held at Ft. Wayne, an
ytrmy post here, or trial. Harris,
who, it is alleged, was to dispose of
the material, will be arraigned be
fore the grand jury Tuesday.
Arrests Follow Exhaustive Probe
The arrests followed an investiga
tion extending over two months and
came, department of justice officials
said, after the first deal in the alleged
plot was put through at Rochester,
N. Y., Thursday. This initial transac
tion, it is alleged, involved 21,000 tons
of material valued at $300,000. Accord
ing to Arthur L. Burkee, chief of the
bureau of investigation here, Collins,
Browne and Harris are charged with
conspiracy to eliminate other bidders
for the material, the bids being held
so low that the highest of the three
would, be far below the value of the
supplies disposed of.
By means of a dictaphone installed
in Captain Nicholson's room at a ho
tel, the federal officers declare, they
followed the alleged conspiracy since
its inception early in April. The mat
ter was placed in their hands by an
other officer of the ordnance depart
ment, whose name they withheld.

BERLIN, June 7. (By the As

of Berlin ceased ' running at 3
o'clock yesterday afternoon as a
result of the declaration, of a 24
hour strike by the Greater Berlin
soviet as a protest against the ex
ecution of Levine Nissen, Bava
rian communist leader, at Munich
Thursday. Only two of the morn
ing papers appeared today and
these in reduced form. The strike
is not general bdt is on a largo
scale.
The workers also are invited to

Karl Liebknecht was killed by a
mob in Berlin early in the year.
REVOLUTION AGAIN
Execution Of Red Leader Is
Spark To Smoldering
Hun Discontent
BERLIN, Friday, June 6. (By the
Associated Press.) The mistake of
the Bavarian cabinet in permitting the
execution of Levine Nissen, a leader of
the Bavarian communists, it , became
apparent today, is likely to result in
another Spartacan attempt against
the government
The political effect of the execution
asserted Itself in Berlin. A general
strike 'was ordered and the indepen
dent Socialist organ Die Freiheit open
ed up an editorial broadside.
The Spartacan movement has been
in course of preparation several weeks
on account of the outcome of the trials
of the slayers of Dr. Liebknecht and
Rosa Yuxemburg, the escape of mili
tary officers imprisoned for killing
the Spartacan leaders and the stem
rule o( Gustav Noske, the minister of
national defense. . The situation has
furnished the independent Socialists,
SpSrtacans and extremists with handy
ammunition.
The political disaffection has ex
tended to the majority Socialists and
resolutions adopted by factory and
workingmen's councils calls on the
party convention, which will meet at
Weimar Tuesday, to demand the re
tirement of Socialists from the present
government. The radical opponents
of the Ebert and Scheidemann govern
ment are also using the tangled peace
situation as another weapon with
which to attack their former com
rades. 4
If the cabinet weathers the blow, it
is believed it wil be chiefly because
the allied reply to the German coun
ter proposals will be sufficiently fav
orable and conciliatory to enable the
present government to regain its pres
tige. Any tangible progress in the peace
negotiations from the German view
point is expected to prove an effective
counter Irritant to the maneuvers of
the independent Socialists.
Today the flurry had already reach
ed the stage of acute crisis, although
the followers of Hugo Haase were said
to be predicting the overthrow of

DYING STRUGGLES Of RED
1 GARY
WEAABE
REGIME IN
N BRUTALITY
BUDAPEST, May 20. (Correspon
dence of The Associated Press.)
What may be the last days of the
"Red" Soviet republic here are
fraught with such terror, hunger, men
tal misery, uprooting of family ties,
heartbreaking partings, flights, ar
rests and illegal lootings that the ma
jority of Hungarians are praying that
such days may never come again.
They live like people caught in a
burning house with the firemen spuirt
ing benzine on the only escape ladder.
One way out may possibly be provid
ed by the Czech and Rumanian arm
ies, who, though national enemies of
the Magyars, are now hailed as sav
iors. The at , mosphere is charged
with fears and alarms worse than
those felt on any battle front. A
contagious fear like that which pre
vails when an army is in rout is
spreading even to foreigners whose
persons are comparatively safe from
arrest owing to the wishes of Bela
Kun, the communist leader, and other
ministers to save themselves from the
gallows when the grand collapse
comes.
When fathers and 'eons flee the
country to evade arrest or to join the
counter-revolutionists, their wives and
mothers whisper at the parting: "Iet
us hope , we may meet in happier
time."
When the correspondent of The As
sociated Press has had occasion to
explain his nationality the listener,
whether red guard, peasant, or civi
lian, has remarked with envy: "What
a fortunate man you are, to be an
American." ,
He would invariably ask whether
it would be possible to reach Ameri
ca and whether foreigners, former ene
mies, would be permitted to land on
lur shores. Peasants, who refuse to
furnish food 4.0 Budapest or other
cities "because they are hostile to
communism - and want shoes and
clothes .more than paper money, of
which they have plenty, gladly
enough sold meals and supplies to the
correspondent on the strength of his
American nationality.
The city of Budapest which a few
weeks ago had a plentiful supply of
egges people almost lived upon them
and potatoes is now without eggs,
because of the obstinacy of the peas
ants. A great many of the stores
have been closed for lack of goods
to sell, or because they have been
requisitioned by the soviet.
The most saddening impression the
visitor receives Is that of a country
in dissolution, being stripped day by
day, mercilessly and inexorably, of its
riches, to benefit nobody. The re
latively pleasant, orderly and bounti
ful life that existed in Hungary a few
months ago, when its neighbor Aus
tria was starving, is gone for many
years to come.
"If anyone wants to be convinced
of the futility of re-making the world.
in a single day with pet theories,' he
should now visit Hungary," was the
remark made by an American naval
officer. , It is estimated that half a
million of Hungary's best citizens
have been obliged to flee from their
homes and wander across the fron
tiers to strange lands.
There are many stories of their at
tempts to save their lives and prop
erty some of which read like Arabian
Night tales. It Is calculated that some
3.000,000,00 kdonen worth of bonds,
gold coin, jewelry, plate,' paintings
and wor kof art have been saved
from the clutches of the red guards
and smuggled across the frontiers by
blockade runners, afoot, on bicycles,
autos or peasant carts. Within a few
weeks, there has grown up a system
by which large percentages of the
value of such property, often, amount
ing to 50 percent have been given for
its safe transportation to Vienna or
Agram. ' Not a few communists took
advantage of such methods of getting
valuables out of the country. Many
jewelers, however, stored their stocks
under sidewalks or hid them in holes
dug; in their cellars in preference to
trusting them to blockade runners.

commodities, particularly those of a

IflAO CHI DECISION SPELLS WAR IN
EAST; U. S. PRESTIGE IN CHINA LOST
Peace Meet Action Is Victory For Military Autocracy In
Japan, Says Noted Authority On Oriental Politics;
China Disappointed at U. S. Yielding
BY THOMAS MILLARD,
Author of "Democracy and the East
ern Question," "Our Eastern Ques
tion," "America and the Far East
ern. Question," . "The New Far
East," etc. Editor of Millard's Re
view, Shanghai.
PARIS, France, June 7. The deci
sion reached in secret Bession by the
so-called council of four of the peace
conference, awarding the Chinese ter
ritory of Kiao Chau to Japan, will
lead to a great war in the Far East
unless the Injustice is corrected.
Not only does this act arouse the
most bitter resentment of the Chinese
people, but it tends to continue and
to aggravate the conditions In the
Far East which are the root of the an
tagonism and dissension between the
foreign powers.
It amounts to a victory for the mili
tary autocracy In Japan, and will con
firm and encourage It in a predatory
and coercive policy toward China and
Russia. -
It will involve America by giving
color to Japan's interpretation of the
Lansing-Ishii agreement relating to
China an interpretation which com
pletely vitiates the traditional policy
of the United States toward China. .
It will cause a tremendous revulsion
of sentiment against the west in the
greater Asiatic world by once more
demonstrating that the unscrupulous
use of the strong arm still counts
more than equity In international af
fairs.
Chinese feel about this question
much as Belgians would feel if the
council of four had decided to give
Germany a mandatory over Belgium,
and then would try to console the Bel
gians by telling them that the league
of nations would give them satisfac
tion later.
Weak Nations Told to Rely on League
Chinese are not oblivious of the fact
so apparent to all who can think in
telligently about world politics, that
the so-called great powers in Europe
decline to entrust their own security
to a league of nations, but insist that
they be protected by alliances and
combinations on the side.
It is only the weak nations that are
told to rely upon the league. s ...
As to Kiau Chau, if Ihey cannot re
cover control of that nlace themselves,
me uninese vasuy woum pieier umi.
it be left in the hands of Germany,
which nation seized, it by an act ol
ruthless intimidation, rather than
have Japan there.
The wishes of the Chinese have
been wholly disregarded in disposing
of this important sacred part of
China's ages-old domain, and the Chi
nese population are left to suffer and
endure the pains of Japanese occupa
tion.
No Chinese trusts . Japan's oft-re
peated promises to restore Kiau Chau
and to evacuate Shantung which as
surance, by the way, was omitted from
the treaty.
Four to One Against China
It is no ' wonder, however, that
China lost her. case before the con
ference, through no fault of her dele
gates in Paris, when it is understood
that she was forced to submit it to
a court of five, of whom four Great
Britain, France, Italy and Japan al
ready had signed in 1917 secret agree
ments among themselves to decide
against China.
China's only chance was that the
United States government would firm
ly exert its Influence in her behalf
and would positfvely refuse its assent
to a ratification by the conference of
those secret agreements.
The American representative on
the council evidently felt compelled,
under what pressure we can conjure,
to yield to mandatory expediency the
moral responsibility which the United
States voluntarily, assumed by induc
ing China to enter the war.
I fear that American prestige and
popularity with Chinese will be much
impaired because of tyis failure of
the' United States firmly to support
China.
The further allotment to Japan of
the former German economic interests
in Shantung province practically as
sures the continuation there and the
extension to other parts of China of
the systematic evasions by Japan of
the "open door" which react so strong
ly against American commercial op
portunity in China.
Americans will feel astonishment
when the study the conditions of
peace, that the only - question that
came before the conference in which
the United States has a positive and
definite interest and responsibility
was allowed practically to go by default

WARM COMMENDATION
IS GIVEN B1SBEEAH BY
COMMANDING OFFICER
T Sergeant First Class Ben H.
Wolf formerly of Bisbee, now with
machine shop truck unit No. 409, in
Franct, has come through military
channels a letter of commendation
from hh commanding office which in
every manner is unique and interest
ing. Wolf was formerly foreman of
the mechanical department of a John
son addition garage. He is a brother
of O. C. Wolf,. now a resident of War
ren. A copy of the commendation has
been received in the district.
"This i3 to personally express of
ficial appreciation of your having cred
ibly and honorably filled the position
you willed during the active 'opera
tions in the St Mihiel, the Argonne
and the Yy Scheldt campaigns, not
withstanding the fact that you were In
an organization of such merit where
promotion was well nigh impossible,"
says the citation which is signed by
H. E. Saville, colonel in the United
States army. s
"No obstacle in civil life can com
pare with those which our repair sys-'
tent had to overcome as to facilities,
parts, makes, etc.," the citation con
tinues. "The numerous comraenda
"tions, citations and recommendations
that have come to us as our part
of the distinction that the 91st division j
has won are but the outdome of the
loyal. Indefatigable and conscientious
attention to duty under all kinds of
danger and hardships, that character
ized the work of our organization."
In giving an idea of the work of
the organization the citation says:
"The operation of motor transit, days
and nights, under fire and without
lights, necessitated working from as
much as 36 to 43 hours in the seat
without rest over No Man's Land, over
shell torn roads In a country where
names were unpronouncable and desig
nations were uncertain, involved a
class of work that can never be
equalled in civil life."
CONCRETE POURING ON
mm RnAn MMjnAV
More than two and one-half miles of
concrete have been laid on the Doug
las end of the Bisbee-Douglas high
way, and concrete pouring is schedul
ed to start on the Bisbee end of the

ment yesterday by the bghway com
mission. Every effort is being made
to push work in all parts of the coun

The Pearce to Cochise highway Is
70 per cent finished, said the same
statement, while the Tombstone to
.Benson road is nearing completion
and the Silver Creek highway east of
Douglas is progressing rapidly On all
three links of the county system the
tlirt and grading work is practically
completed and remaining work is the
installation of concrete in dips, brdges
end culverts.
Remaining in the treasury of the
highway commission on May 31, the
commission reports, was a tltal of
$063,280.65 of the original $1,000,000,
which was placed in the hands of the

RAIN KEEPS BOXERS
INACTIVE; WILLARD'S
WIND IN BAD SHAPE
TOLEDO, June 7. Several hun
dred persons who visited the training
camps of Jack Dempsey and Jess Wil-
lard today in anticipation of seeing
seme glove performances were disap
pointed because a severe rainstorm
breaking as Willard was about to
start his workout, prevented exhibi
tions in both camps. j
Dempsey was more disappointed
than any of the spectators, as he has
been loafing sine Monday and was
eager to resume training. He want
ed to box his partners in his living
quarters but Manager Kearns told him
to wait until tomorrow. If the day is
pleasant both boxers will play to ca
pacity houses as they plan to double
their efforts after missing today.
Willard complained today that he
is finding the change in climate from
California to Ohio a hardship. He
said that when he left Los. Angeles
ten days ago his wind was in excel
lent condition but the conditions here
have affected his breathing. Other
members of the champion's entourage
who accompanied him fi;om the coast
made similar complaints.
"Now that the weather is getting
cooler, I think I will be ;able to work
faster but it will be a week before
I will be in condition to go at top
speed," Willard said. "I expect that
my breathing will be all right as
quickly as I become accustomed to
the climatic conditions."

MICHIGAN IS WINNER
CONFERENCE MEET;
JOHNSON THE STAR
CHICAGO, June 7. Scoring in
eleven of sixteen events, the Unlver
Blty of Michigan track and field team
today won the annual games of the
Western Intercollegiate conference
athletic association totaling 44
points. The University of Chicago
was second with 34 points and Illi
noia third with 22, just one point
ahead .of the aggregation from Notre
Dame University.
Overshadowing all team perform
ces, however, was the work of C. E.
Johnson of Michigan. He started in
four events, won all of them and in
the high and broad jumps set new
conference records. Only in the high
jump was he pushed, V. J. Paige of
Ames clearing the bar at six feet 1-4
inch and forcing the big Michigan
athlete to go two inches higher to
win. The previous record was six
feet 1V inches and was made by Rob
ert Wahl of Wisconsin in 1914.
In the broad jump Johnson distanc
ed all his competitors on his first at
tempt but he took two more trials and
cleared 24 feet and one inch, better
ing the conference record of 23 feet
11 1-4 inches which he himself estab
lished last year. In the hurdles he
won his heats and finals with ridic
ulous ease.
The twenty points garnered by
Johnson made him the high point
winner of the day but there were not
able performances also by W. Hayes
of Notre Dame, who ran the century
in 0:09 4-5, tieing the eastern and
western college records and then
sprinted away frcm his field in the
furlong dash. He ran on a track sof
tened a bit by yesterday's rain and
In the face of a quartering wind.
Defeat in the two mile and failure
to finish better than third in the re
lay virtually killed Chicago's chances
of winning the meet. McMahon, the
big Nebraska quarter miler, was re
sponsible for the relay result as he
took the baton for the last lap a
good thirty yards behind Speer of
Chicago, and ran the latter off his
feat. McMahon's finish made up in a
measure for his defeat early in the
afternoon in the 440-yard dash.
McMahon was "boxed" and left be
hind at the start of that event, when
Curtiss of Chicago, jumping to the
pole, opened up an eight yard gap
that he held to the finish with Oss of
Minnesota staying of McMahon's
sturdy rush for second place.

We've called them heroes; they've

Blushing a bit 'neath the old tin hat.
As. day after day, we've swelled the

Of pride for valor, and pity for pain,
And who will wonder they found it

But now that's past. Arc you proud

Then find them a place that a man

iV A -
BY ROBERT P. DORMAN
N. E. A. Reporter-Photographer, Who
Knew Angeles and Villa in Mexico
Senor Carranza, the bewhiskered
president of Mexico, sees trouble and
lots of it, just ahead.
For "Pancho" Villa, bandit, extra
ordinary, has again scored.
In the past Villa has demonstrated
to the world that he possessed cour1
age and an almost uncanny ability in
the handling of men in guerrilla war
fare, but he now shows tht he has
brains and the courage which sacri
fices self in the interests of the cause
fought for.
But Villa, as the general in com
mand of large armies, went down to
defeat at the hands of his more tech
nically trained opponents
Now comes the announcement from
the mountains of Mexico that Felipe
Angeles has been named provisional
president of Mexico, and commander-in-chief
of the rebel forces, with Villa
as second in command.
His Facp a Mask, Eyes Black, Piercing
With Angeles at the head of the
revolution, the cause of the Villastas
should take on a new life.
I first met Angeles shortly before
the battle of Leon. .
Though he is of slender build and
medium height, he impressed me as
possesing an iron determination.
His face is like a mask, revealing
nothing of his thoughts.
Only the eyes, black and piercing,
give a hint of the tremendous will
power which animates him.
His Indian ancestry is revealed in
the high cheek bones and straight
black hair.
In manner he is very dignified, giv
ing me the impression of talking with
one of the grandees of old Spain.
Though ho treated me courteously
and with every censideration, it was
plain that he had no great love for
Americans.
At the same time his conversation
indicated that he fully recognized
the fact that the future welfare of
Mexico depended on the friendship of
her powerful neighbor.
I believe his attitude would be that
Mexico should be for Mexicans, yet
that he would be jutt in the treatment
of foreign interests. .
He has spent hi3 entire career in
the service of his country.
Under the Diaz rule in Mexico, he
was educated for the regular army.
A graduate of Chapultepec, the
West Point of Mexico, he was sent
to France to the military academy
of Ct. Cyr, whero he completed his
military schooling.
Afterwards, returning to Mexico, he
was made chief of artillery for Diaz,
and then head of the Mexican military
college.
With the downfall of Diaz he trans
ferred his allegiance to Madero, and,
unMke many others of the former fed
eral forces, was steadfast in his ad
herence to the new government.
When the overthrow and murder oc
curred, he refused to join the victor
ious Huertistas, was arrested and sen
tenced to be shot, but escaped and
joined the forces of Villa.
For him he acted as chief of ar
tillery and second in command.
Advice Might Have
Saved Villa's Power
I ;was present hi the .battle of Leon,
the battle which marked the over
throw of the. Villista military power,
and I have always felt that had Villa
followed the advice of Angeles and
awaited the nltiick of the Carrancistas
instead i attafkin; himself, he would
not have been defeated, and the sub
Mi m
'V -r ' I-1
mam
&f

Jit
sequent difficulties with the United
States would have been avoided.
No better contrast of the nature of
the two men could have been afforded
than by watching their actions during
the fight.
Villa was on fire, restless, unable
to contain himself, and finally, as a
last resort, putting himself at the
head of his men and leading them
forward in the final assault which
placed him in the trap Obregon had
set for him.
On the other hand, Angeles watched
the varying fortunes cf the fight with
never a change of expression.
Battle orders were given in the
same tone of voice that he would have
used in ordering his dinner.
And when the end came that he
had foreseen and warned Villa of, it
was Angeles who, by his coolness,
saved as much as possible from the
rout.
But his coolness and undemonstra
tive bearing dees not make for popu
larity with the Meixcan peon.
The fire and ardor of a Villa makes
a greater appeal.
With the magnetic personality of
Villa as chief recruiting agent the
new revolution will likely prove form
idable. NEW YORK, June 7 More than
35,000 persons from every state in the
union attended the Roosevelt memor
ial exhibition at Columbia university.

YEARS' SUFFERING
"For the first time in two years I
am feeling strong and well again, and
jt was nothing but Tanlac that fixed
me up," said George M. Dell of 1357
Thirteenth street, Denver, Colo.
"I don't know what was the matter
with me," he continued, "but I had
lost my appetite and the little I forced
down failed to digest and I suffered
terribly with gas on my stomacn.
There was a constant pain in my back,
and my legs and feet would, swell so
at times that I couldn't put on my
shoes. My kidneya worried me eo
much I never could get a good night's
rest. I felt tired and worn out alt
the time, the medicine I took did me
no good and I got into such an awful
fix that I had to lay off from work as
much as three days at a time, and
when I did go to work it was an 1
could do to get through the day.
"Tanlac was recommended to me so
strongly that I decided to try it and
my first bottle brought ray appetite
back. I have been entirely relieved
of that pain and bloating, my kidneys
don't bother mo any more, I sleep like
a log and can do as good a day's work
as anybody, in fact I never felt better
in my life than I do right now."

Villa Firing Squad Ended Deadly
Feud When Three Herreras Fell
JUAREZ, Mexico, June 7. When
old Jose de la Herrera and his two
sons trudged out to the Parral ceme
tary before the Villa firing squad In
the dawn of Easter morning, a Mexi
can fued more bloody than any of the
Kentucky mountains came to a cli
max. Francisco Madero's call to the
mountain men of Chihuahua in the
fall of 1910 brought Villa from hisj
brigand rendezvous in the Sierrrai
, Madres, Crozco from the San Andres i
llanos and the Herrera brothers from;
the copper mines of Parra. Together,'
they fought the revolution of 1910-11 1
and together they marched into Mexi
co city in the triumphal entry. "Pan-i
cho," Maclovio and Luis all wore the
tri-color of the revolutionary army.
When Madero was killed and the
constitutionalist revolution started,
the Herreras and Villa again took up
arms against the Huerta federals. Eut
the inevitable break between Carran-,
za and Villa occurred. All of Villa's!
old friends and followers reamined
with him but the Herreras father and
five sons. They Joined Carranza
against Villa. A quarrel on the sta
tion platform at Jimenez during
which denunciations and dares were
hurled at Villa by Maclovio Herrera
was said to have been the prime fac
tor in breaking this long friendship!
between Villa and the Herrera family. (
Maclovio, the deaf, and Luis, thej
iame; joined Caranza as generals of
the line; old Jose de la luz (Joseph
of the Light) came to Juarez and be
came mayor here. Villa led his hosts
to defeat against " Obregon, . fighting
under Carranza's ''.banner To his Gol
den Ones Villa swore an oath that he
would exterminate the entire Herrera
family. Later Maclovio was killed by a
concealed machine gun as he crossed
the border to join Cararnza's forces.
The report said it was a case of mis
taken identity. ' "
Christmas week, 1917. Villa sprang
a surprise attack on Torreon, com
mercial capital of the rich Laguna
district. Luis Herrera was the Car
ranza commander. He was captured,
tortured and mutilated, then hanged
to a telegraph pole with a picture of
Carranza suspended from the body.
Two years elapsed and Villa rode
into Parral at the head of his troops
on Easter morning, 1919. The de
fen3a socialies or home guards, sur
rendered. Jose do la Luz Herrera,
Malchor Herrera and Zeferiano Her
rera were commanders in this organ
ization. Villa disarmed and pardoned
all but the three Herreras. The
other officers interceded for them.
"No! This is a personal matter,"
Villa said.
Old man Herrera adavneed, saluted,
offered his hand. Villa refused it
Realizing his fate was sealed the head
of the Herrera house denounced Villa

'as "the greatest traitor and worst

"Take them out to the Campro
santo," Villa ordered, and to the dead
march of the drums they were led out
and executed on Easter mornine. All
died bravely, without eye bandages
and facing the firing squad squarely.
This done, Villa announced that his
oath had been fulfilled, his grudge
satisfied and that the younger Her
rera boy would be spared.
All the Herreras were famous in
Mexico. It was Maclovio who
charged and captured a machine gun
at the battle of Torreon in 1914 when
a general of division under Villa.
Luis Herrera was one of the first
of Madero's commanders to be
wounded. .
Herrera, the father, was credited
with saving Major Frank Thompkins
from annihilation at the hands of a
mob at Parral during the Villa chase,
Melchor, as mayor of Juarez, was
always friendly to the Americans and
saved '.many Americans from death
before the firing squad. The mother
of the Herreras is dead and only the
boy survives Villa's hatred and then
only by grace of Villa's pardon.
CORN TASSEL WINS
BELMONT SUBURBAN
NEW YORK, June 7. At the Bel

track that was lightning fast, R. G.
Wilson's five 'yeas old gelding Corn
Tassel, by Santoi-Cornfield, won the
classic Suburban at one mil 3 and a
quarter. The value of the stake was
?5,200, and the gelding, after a driv
ing finish all through the final fur
long, just nosed out W. R. Coe's three
year old colt Sweep On, with Com
mander J. K. L. Ross's Boniface' third,
a length and a half away.
The winners time, 2:02 1-5, is really
a record for this race as the official
time of 2:00 flat to Whisk Broom II.
when he won this event in 1913, gen
erally was not accepted by horsemen
as correct.
The showing made by Sweep On
which under the scale, was giving 14
pounds to the winner, was an excel
lent performance. Sweep On and his
stable mate. Over There, were the
public choice at 14 to 5, while 16 to
5 was the closing quotations made by
the layers against Corn Tassel's
chances for first honors.
The scratching of Vindex, Prin
cess and Star Class reduced the field
to eight starters.
War Cloud finished fourth, Exter
minetar fifth, Over There sixth, and
Papp, which was left at the post,
seventh, having passed the tired La
nieus, which finished last.

Drilling
Whereas other companies begin by selling stock with promise to
drill, THE GREATER TEXAS OIL COMPANY immediately began to
drill before offering any stock. Two wells aro already drilled in
in Burkburnett and arrangements are being completed to drill two
wells immediately in Block 72. Their drilling program contemplates:
1. Two deep wells in Block 72 to be drilled as soon as neces
sary funds are raised.
2. Two deep wells in Burkburnett already drilled In and pro
ducing. 1
3. Six shallow wells in Archer County and Iowa Park.
Estimate of Profits
1. Present production from the two producing wells will yield
already about 35 per cent per year on the total capitalization. Add to
this the estimated income from six shallow wells and we confidently
expect close to 150 per cent per year dividends.
2. Block 72 with two wells should bring a settled production' of
4000 barrels daily. However, a settled production of only 2000 bar
rels will bring 11,600,000 a year, making a total of about 12,000.000,
or 50 PER CENT DIVIDEND PER MONTH, or 600 PER CENT PER
YEAR. .
Absolute Guarantee
1. Stockholders will first be paid 100 per cent of the net earnings
from oil dividends until 100 per cent' of the respective amounts in
vested has been repaid. '
2. Stockholders will then receive 75 per cent of the net earnings,
only 25 per cent being set eside for further development.
3. All investors in this fund, officers and directors included,
will participate with absolute equality, each according to the propor
tion of stock held.

is now United States minister to

charged and their places filed with
others who will be anxious to go into
active service. This 20 days period
will also provide time to arrange de
tails for transportation and camp. I
suggest Camp Maybry at Austin as
mobilization camp. My anxiety that
lives and property of citizens be amply
protected and my knowledge of con
servatism and efficiency of officers
and men of Texas cavalry brigades
prompts this suggestion.". .
The department's telegram to tne
southern department's commander
was as follows:
War Dept. Seeks Information -
"The governor of Texas wires the
department that the Mexican situation
appears to be so critical that an em
ergency may arise at the most unex
pected moment requiring a larger
force of troops on the border to pro
tect lives and property of citizens
than are at present available. Your
views and any information bearing up
on the situation ,are desired by wire.'
Confidential reports reaching the
war department within the last week
regarding the situation in north Mex
ico contained no information, it was
said, that would lead army officers to
hold the opinioa expressed by Gover
nor Hobby. The border guard at pres
ent exceeds 20.Q00 troops,, including
cavalry, infantry, field artillery, air
squadrons and engineers units, dis
tributed from Yuma, Ariz., to south
of Laredo. The latter point Is head
quarters of the Fourth United States
cavalry. Behind these is an even larg
er force at the demobilization camps
or en route. "
Major General de Rosey C. Cabell,
in command of the Mexican border dis
trict, has standing orders to dispose
the American troops as he thinks best
to protect lives and property.

that 19 Mexicans "were killed by Mexi

Charles Morgan, was shot in the foot
in a raid at Navojoa; that five Mexi
cans were killed- by Mexican bandits
at Nuri, 12 miles from where H. S.
White, an American truck driver of
Tucson, Ariz., was recently slain.'
It is believed now that White was
killed by" Mexican bandits and not by
Yaquis, as was first reported, since
the tracks of his' slayers showed that
they More shoes and not the Yaqui

The murder of C. W. P. Tevote; min

PROTEST SEGREGATION
OF MEXICAN CHILDREN
SAN FRANCISCO, June 7. A pro
test against the alleged segregation of
Mexican children in El Centra and
Santa Paula schools and the supposed
placing of these children with negroes
was sent to Governor Stephens by Ra
mon P.de Negri, consul general of
Mexico here today. The protest was
first made by Gara Zertuche, Mexican
consul at Los Angeles.
The alleged "discrimination" is the
result of "activity by certain big In
terests to stir up trouble between the
United States and Mexico.' 'de Negri
charged. . . i, .
"In this connection, 'he continued,
"I may say that letters have been in
tercepted by the Mexican government
showing plainly that these financial
interests are supporting and supplying
funds to the counter revolutionary
elements represented by Villa, Diaz,
Angeles, Palez and others."

FOUR WORLD RECORDS
ON TRACKSHATTERED
PHILADELPHIA, June 7. Four
world's records were broken today
at the Meadowbrook games on Frank
lin Field, when four University of
Pennsylvania sprinters lowered the
relay figures in the 400 meters, 440
yards, 800 meters and 880 yard
yard events.
The records for the 800 meters and
the 880 yards were the first to go
when W. C. Claypool, F. S. Davis and
E. W. Smith, running for Pennsylva
nia, won the 880 yards race. Two
strings were put up, one at 800 meters
and the other at 880 yards and two
sets of timers were used. The time
of" the Pennsylvania quartette was
1:26 1-5 for the 800 meters. The for
mer time was 1:36, made by a Swed
ish team at the 1908 Olympic games.
The new time for the 880 yards
was 1:2,7 4-5 seconds, breaking the
old record of 1:29 2-5 made by a Chi
cago University team in 1915. The
400 meters was run in teh new time
of 42 2-5 seconds, lowering the world's
figures of 42 3-5 seconds made by a
German team at the 1912 Olympic
games.
The new figures for the 440 yards
are 42 3-5" seconds against the old
figures of 44 seconds made by the
Chicago A. A. in the A. A. U cham
pionships of 1917 and in which Lan
ders was one of the runners.
Joie Ray of Illinois A. C. failed in
his attempt to break the world's
record for the mile in two tries.
REVOKE CHARTERS OF
CANADIAN UNIONS
WASHINGTON, June 7. Martin F
Ryan, president of the Brotherhooc
of Railway Carmen has revoked th
charter of two local .unions of that or
der at Winnipeg, and a third at Ed
monton, Canada, it was announced, ar
American Federation of Labor head
suarters, on the ground that action
of their members in appropriating
money for organizing the "one big un
ion" which has led to strikes now
progressing in Western Canada, is a
disregard of union law. Other heads
of international unions are said to be
preparing similar orders affecting
their crafts.
The revocation. President Ryan said.
was only incidentally based on the J
strike now in progress. The locals
affected are alleged to have 6pent the
order's money to assist in creating the
"one big union" including all other
crafts, which thereafter called the gen
eral strike. Organizers, he said, had
been sent into Canada to begin reor
ganizing new locals of the Brother
hood in place of those abolished.
It was also said at federation head
quarters that William H. Johnson,
president of the International Ma
chinists' union, had taken similar ac
tion affecting a local of that order in
Vancouver and for the same reasons.

POLL OF NATION
III FAVOR OF
NEW YORK June 7. Public opin
ion is very strongly in favor of an
early return of the railroads to their
owners, as shown by the vote of near
ly 6,000 editors of daily and weekly
newspapers throughout the country.
A questionnaire sent to every editor
in the country (13,424) brought re
plies from 5,922 or 44 per cent, and
83 per cent of the editors reported'
their communities in favor of a re
sumption of private management.
The questionnaire was conducted on
behalf of the Association of Railway
Executives, and was completed before
President Wilson announced in his re
cent message to Congress that the go
ernment would relinquish control of
the railways at then end of the year.
Editors were asked not to give their
personal opinions, but to appraise the
sentiment in their communities. The
four chief questions were as follows:
1 Does public opinion in your Judg
ment seem to favor the return of rail
roads to' private ownership and oper
ation as soon as this can be properly
accomplished?
2. If so, is thi3 opinion in part based
on the desire to see competition in
service and facilities restored?
3. What la the present sentiment in
your community on government own;
ership and operation of railroads?
.4. What has been the feeling ' re
garding the proposal to extend the
period of government for five years?
On the first question "Does public
opinion in your judgment seem to
favor the return of railroads to pri
vate ownership and operation as soon
as this can properly be accomplish
ed?" 83 percent voted yes, 11 per cent
voted no, whle 4 per cent were doubt
ful and 2 per cent expressed no opin
ion. On the second question, "If so, is
this opinion in part based on the de
pire to see competition in service and
facilities restored?" 75 per cent vot
ed yes, 6 per cent -voted no, with 5
and 14 per cent doubtful and blank
respectively
On the third question, "What! Is
the present sentiment in your com
munity on government ownership and
operation of railroads?" 78 per cent
estimated public sentiment as against
government ownership, 11 per cent
for, with 7 per cent doubtful and 4
per cent blank.
On the fourth question, "What has
been the feeling regarding the pro
posal to extend the period ,of govern
ment operation for five years?" the
vote ws a follows: .Against. 74 per

That public opinion on the railroad
question is not divided on party lines
is plain from a study of the vote In
the various states. In Texas, for ex
ample, although only 3 of the 331 ed
itors replying are Republicans, the
number in favor of a return of the
roads is 88 per cent, considerably
higher than the percentage (84 per
cent) in the strong Republican state
of Pennsylvania.
Tennessee voted 97' per cent as
compared with 83 per cent in Maine.
Of the 5,992 replies, 2,052 were
from Republican papers, 1.6S9 from
Democratic and 2,181 independent and
scattering.
The states showing 95 per cent or
more in favor of the return of the
roads are Connecticut, 97; New
Hampshire, 100; Tennessee, 87.
Those showing from 90 to 95 per
cent in favor are Florida, 94; Iowa,
90; New York, 90; and Wyoming, 94.
Those giving from 85 to 90 per cent
in favor are Delaware, 89; Georgia,
87; Indiona, 88; Massachusetts, 89;
Michigan, 88; Nevada, 85; New Jer
sey, 89; North Carolina, 86 ;5 Ohio.
87; South Carolina, 89; Texas, 88;
Utah. 86; Vermont, 86; Virginia, 85;
and West Virginia, 87.
Those returning from 80 to 85 per
cent are Alabama, 84; Illinois, 82;
Kansas," 82;, Kentucky, 83; Maine, 83;
Mississippi, 83; : Missouri, (81; Mon
tana, 83; Pennsylvania, 84; South Da

.Those giving from 75 to 80 per cent
are Arizona, 76t California, 77; Col

land, 75; Wisconsin, 76.
The only states below 75 per cent
are Idaho, 72; Arkansas, 69, and
North Dakota, 61.
The strongest sentiment , against
government ownership wan found to
be in New England and the south,

Kitty Trot Is Going to Oust
EX EX EX EX EX EX
But It Is Dance for Nimble
Eileen Cotty's Pet Kitten
Gave Her Idea for New Step
That She's Going to Turn
Into Dance for Ballroom.
N.
E. A. Special to The Review
NEW YORK, June 7. Watching
antics of her little tortoise-shell pet
kiten, playing with a ball of wool,
Eileen Cotty, solo dancer la "Good
Morning Judge," conceived .the Idea
for the steps in her new dance,
which she calls the "Kity Trot."
So amusing and yet graceful are the
movements in this dance that Miss
Cotty has been asked to develop the
"Kitty Trot" Into something suitable
for the ball room.
When Miss Cotty is ready to spring
this novelty on a dance-mad New York
it is predicted that it will sweep the
"Prohibition Jag." the "Chateau
Thierry Crawl," and the "Tank Tan
go," the present favorites, completely
off the bees-waxed floors.
-However, Miss Cotty issues a warn
ing. The "Kitty Trot," she says, will
be no light terpischorean trifle for the
tired and elephantine. It will be suit
able only for the nimble-toed and for
those whose waist line hinges still
function. '
BEST GAME OF YEAR
IS BOOKED FOR TODAY
ON WARREN DIAMOND
The hottest, hardest fought, fastest
and best baseball game of several sea
sons is slated for this afternoon at
the Warren park, when the rival teams
of Bisbee and Lowell will clash in
their first official game of the year.
Both teams are in excellent condition,
both are anxious for the first victory
and members of each organization are
on tip toe3 for the opening of the lo
cal season.
The rivalry between the two organ
izations is increased by the fact that
the business men of Bisbee are back
ing their team financially while the
merchants of Lowell haVe come to the
support of their nine. Fans of both
cities are counting on taking the open
er and getting oft to a flying start in I
the season. . v : . i
One of the features. of the. game is!
the uncertainty in the district as to j
which of the teams will take the dia-i
mond at odds. In sporting circles the j
fans are guessing. Last night none of I
them were willing to make wagers j
either on the Bisbee or Lowell pro-i
ducts, and few sporting chances will
be taken until after fans have had a I
chance to see the teams work out be-!
fore the game begins. Residents of
Bisbee were as uncertain of the pos-j
sible outcome as were the fans of Lo
well. All they were confident of is
mai me game win De a winwin oi
speed and class, since both teams are
composed entirely of seasoned and ex
perienced baseball artists.
Billruan, who has a fast ball with ;
mysterious twist, will start the game j
for the Bisbee nine, with Scott, an j
Indian receiver behind the plate. o i
the Lowellites, Lee, a former Tacoma !
moundsman, will start, with Rinehart j
held in reserve. I

Coming toward the cab of the en

holding it in his left hand called on

OLD NEPTUNE blinks with kindly eye at the kiddie? who disport
themselves in sand or surf at Santa Barbara.
Nor does he overlook maidens fair and ladies matronly nor yet mem
bers of the male persuasion who may wish to swim out and say, "Hello,
Old Nep, how are you getting on these bouncing, billowy days?"
For, verily, this Genial Gentleman of the Sea has been more than gener
ous to Santa Barbara. He gave this fair resort city, for its birthright, a price
less inlay of smooth, hard beach an ideal bathing beach of pure white sand.
He next arranged with Old Sol to send forth a steady stream of sun
shine that folk might be warm and "comfortable the while he laved them.
He kept away from this sheltered offspring, treacherous under-tows and
tide-rips so that youngsters might play about and that grown-ups might swim

Oldest of the Old
The oldest living thing in the world

forests is about 6300 years old. There
are some 5000-year-old redwoods in
California. These fine old trees were
centuries old when Moses was found
in the bullrushes.
And we humans speak of a "ripe
old age" at eighty! But then, trees
don't overeat, sleep in nventilated

JEROME IN TO
TIE OVER MINE
IHNACOZARIMEX.
Syndicate Secures a 60-Day
Option on Rich Santa
Lucia Property
JEROME, June 1. Aa a result ot
negotiations which have been carried
on for several days, a syndicate heal
ed by D. J. O'Rourke, of the Potter.
Jarvea & O'Rourke Construction com
pany, has perfected a 60-day option
upon the Santa Lucia mine, located
a Nacozarl, Mexico. - The deal -was
consummated through the efforts of
C. M. Connor, one of the proprietors
of the Central Pharmacy.
The affairs of the syndicate are
being handled by Mr. O'Rourke -who
is to leave in the morning for the
property. He -will be met en route
by some engineers and geologists
who have been retained to , make a
complete examination of the proper
ty. The amount of money involved
in the option has not been made puo
lic but it is said to be a considerable
sum.
The perfection of the option is but
another step in the revival of mining
interest which is occurring in the
district, and throughout the state in
a lesser degree. This same syndi
cate is said to be Interested in a num
ber of local propositions, ' and it is
probable that upon the return of Mr.
O'Rourke there will be an announce
ment of supreme interest in local cir
cles. The Santa Lucia mine is one of the
richest of the many exceptionally
rich silver properties !a Mexico." It
was located and developed by six
local Mexicans who have developed
the prospect without other capital
than their own labors. The develop
ment has of necessity been exceed
ingly Blow since the major portion of
their time was occupied In earning
grubstakes to finance them during
the brief periods they were thus en
abled to devote to the property. Re
i alizing that they had reached the
limit of their efforts in this direction,
the sextette placed the Santa Lucia
upon the market through Mr. Connor.
The price asked is $150,000 cash.
The Santa Lucia is situated about
four miles from Nacozarl. On the
main claim of the group a shaft has
been sunk to a depth of 10S feet, 18
feet having been sunk in the past
two months. Assays from a drift run
on the 90-foot level show a value of
270 ounces of silver to the ton. The
ore also averages 17 per cent copper
and 32 per cent lead.
The extent of the ore body is said
to be enormous. Engineers that have
examined the property state flat it
Is literally a mountain of high grade
ore. In the last 18 feet of the work,
the shaft has been in ore which is
said to carry, much higher values than
those shown in the last assay. '
Engineers - .representing many of
the larger syndicates have made ex
aminations of the property, and all
reports were highly . flattering. Fol
lowing the announcement in the Ver
de Copper News of the listing of the
mine, offers and inquiries from all
parts of the United States have pour-t
ed in on Mr. Connor.
Lane Plan For
Alaska Soldiers
WASHINGTON, June 7. Soldiers
who enlisted from Alaska and Hawaii
may take ' advantage of Secretary
Lane's proposed "Homes for Soldiers"
law as a result ot the activity of the
Alaskan Chapter of the American
Mining Congress which appealed by
cable to Secretary Lane to include
Alaska in the proposed bill. Alaska
furnished more than five thousand
men for the army more than half
of the available young men in the
territory. The wonderful agricultu
ral possibilities of Alaska are little
known In the United States but the
Mining Chapter called attention to
the rights of that far away country
to have its men returned to the state
of their adoption. Hawaii which fur
nished a large quota of soldiers will
be included In the bill which will be
presented by Congressman Mondell,
the latest bill being a compilation of
the better features of several similar
bills prepared by leaders of both par
ties In both houses.

regarded as somewhat of a model in
mining camp development, was erect

fuUy;carried out, even to the irregular
plastering in soft tints of gray, pink,

Hard adobe . will . be used as con

Progressiveness of West Is
Shown in House Conditions
Prevailing in Mine. Towns
Government Standards Of Sanitation, Comfort, Cheerful
Environment, Put In Effect For War and Thought
Revolutionary, Already Had Been Surpassed
Irj Mining. Districts., of Southwest
One of the many interesting and
unexpected, bi-products of the war has '
been the inauguration in this country
of the policy of building workmen's
dwellings by the federal government,
and the Inauguration of government
standards of housing for workmen un
der the housing administration of the
labor department. Otto K. Eidlitz,
the well known New York builder, has
been nade housing administrator, and
associated with him haB teen a group
of public spirited professional ; men
working day and night to develop the
government housing program. '
"The government action will stamp
for the next hundred years the type
of house that is to be built for indus
trial workers," said one observer, but
Irrespective of this statement, there
can be no question that the standards
adopted by the government will have
a potent influence upon the housing
of workmen in this country for many
years to come.
Requirements Are Specific
The government standards recently
published go into considerable detail
of requirements for the houses, cover
ing the questions of light, ventilation,
depth of the front and b'apk; yards,
the distance between houses, and
takes into-consideration even such de
tails as the depth of clothes closets,
arrangements of halls, stair and doors,
the place for sinks and wash tubes,
plumbing, heighth of buildings and ot
rooms. It also completely bars liv
ing quarters in basements and cellars,
!l'HILrllH",H ,'.
Two noteworthy examples of
mining towns that have been built
in the Southwest during the past
few years are the towns of Ajo,
Arizona, and Tyrone, New Mex
ico, both housing 'projects of min
ing companies.
Ajo is the project of the New
Cornelia Copper Company, where
immense bodies 6i low-grade ore
called for work on a large scale
and consequently a town of con
siderable size. It has been the (
effort of the management to build
"a model town and everything is
faithfully designed in a modern
Spanish type of architecture.
Green grass is at a premium on
the desert, but the park in Ajo is
a spot worth going miles to see.
In the Burro Mountains, New
Mexico, is the housing project of
the Phelps Dodge Corporation,1
built in old Spanish mission style,
the buildings in pale tints of gray,
tan, cream and pink plaster,
rough and uneven'. The tile roofs
of the imperfectly burned tile of
the older days carry out the type
of architecture that made the
buildings at the San Diego Expo- '
sition famous. . '
. Both projects represent efforts
on the part of die managements .
to make mining towns attractive
as places to live.
and the old type dormitories, barracka
and bunk houses, and tenement
houses are regarded as generally un
desirable. Western Houses Ahead of East
That the west ia in advance'of the
east in housing betterment is shown
by the faot that in ; the east the
government standards are regarded as
the high water mark in housing prac
tice .while there are many towns in
the west that could boast of all gov
ernment standards several years be
fore such standards were made, andj
in many . of the features, have : gone
the government one better. I
Mine Towns Outstrip U. 6. Standards'
The mining industry has long been
interested in housing development;
such twons as Ajo, built by the New
Cornelia: Tyrone, built by the Phelps
Dodge Corporation; Verde, by the
Verde Extension Co., and Clarkdale
by the United Verde, would make In
dustrial towns in the east built by the
government standards look quite ordi
nary. It has been the' policy of many of
the mining companies of the west to
encourage. their employes - to build,
their own homes, assisting them by
means of their building and loan as
sociations, but some of the companies
have undertaking housing projects,
and it interesting to compare some
of these with the government stan
dards. The coal mining camp of the Phelps

CONDUCT DIAMOND
DRILL .CJMCN
Work on Minimum of 2000
Ft. of Drilling to Begin
Within a Week
JEROME, . June 7. Extensive dia
mond drilling operations at the Grand
Island mine will be inaugurated in
the course of the next week according
to an announcement made by R. E.
Moore, president of the company. The
contract, which calls for, a minimum
of 2,000 feet of diamond drilling, haB
been let to the International Diamond
Drilling company of San Francisco.
The first test hole 1b to be sunk
from the shaft north toward the ad
joining Shea , property on the 500-foot
level From the shaft, the company
has crosscut ' for a distance of 220
feet in this direction. The other test
hole will go southeast towards the
Arizona Girl claim.
At the present time, the drift on the
500-foot level towards the ledge first
encountered on the 170-foot level has
preceded about 400 feet. At this
point a 12-foot ledge of quartz carry
ing low grade iron sulphide and some
copper .sulphide values was encount
ered. This quartz vein was followed
fcr over 20 feet.. The crosscut proved
too expensive, however, costing in the
neighborhood of 25 per foot, and it
was decided to continue the explora
tion with a diamond drill.
It is the belief of the officials of
the company, that this vein Intersect
the ledge ,the outcroppings of which
are found on the Arizona Girl claim.
A thousand feet of drilling should es
tablish either, the correctness or fal
lacy of this theory.
' Tberei "vill.be no. cessation in the
work of drifting towards the big ledge
discovered on the 170-foot level. Op
erations have been temporarily sus
pended at the mine owing to an acci
dent to the compressor which brought
about a shutdown yesterday.
The accident wll necessitate the
re-boring of the cylinders, which are
being torn down for removal to the
United Verde machine Bhops. It will
require a week or ten days to repair
and install the cylinders, and effect
other repairs to the machinery. , The
work will be rushed to the utmost
that ther may be no delay in either
the drifting or drilling operations.
According to the estimates of Mr.
Moore, the drift will have to be push
ed about 200 feet further before the
main ledge is encountered. This be
lief is based upon the dip of the
ledge, the degree of which has been
accurately determined at the 170-foot
level, together with subsequent cross
cuts.
MINERAL RELIEF -COMMISSION
TO
PAY VISIT HERE
According to advices received here
by local mining men, the war min
plating a visit to the district in the
latter part of June or early in July.
The visit will be made in connection
with the business of the commission
in the adjustment of mining claims,
though it is said there will .be no
vouchers from this locality presented.
The relief commission is expected
to arrive In , Tucson about June 25,
where the formal session ; will be
held. This commission was appiont-
ed by the secretary of Interior to ad
just and liquidate the losses of com
panies and individuals, principally
in the production of manganese,
chrome, pyrtes and tungsten durng
the perod of the war, as provded by
the act of March 2, 1919.
Juat what 13 to be accomplished by
the presence of the commission here
has not been stated, .and there is a
possibility the officials will.be unable
to carry out' the announced plan. In
any event, it is, not anticipated that
the whole body will be present, but
that it will be represented by one of
the members.
The time of the organization will
be pretty well taken up with the
claims of the manganese and tungs

GRAND
By- Product of
Smelter Waste
New Discovery
CALUMET, Mich., June 7. For
the first time in the history of
lake copper mining, a by-product
is being recovered from the
smelter waste. During the past
week the Michigan Smelting com
pany shipped 80,000 pounds If
arsenic of lime which was ex
tracted from smelted copper. This
product is valuable as an insecti
cide and it takes, the place of ar
senic of lead, parts green or other
materials used in destroying para
sites on seed vegetables.
Experiments have been carried
on for upwards of a year with the
arsenic product and they have
reached a point where its value
has been proven. At least Michi
gan agricultural supply houses
are satisfied that it will come In
to general use and the copper
country's first product, apart from
copper, is finding a market in
wis state. While the income
from the by-product does not run
into large values, the Industry
may be enlarged to sufficient pro-
portions, in time to become a val
uable asset
The copper from which the ar
senic is extracted In- compara
tively large quantities come from
. a mine in the north end of the
country and, aside from the Ah
meek, the mine in question is the
only one which poduces rock con
taining arsenic. There is a little
arsenic in La Salle and Calumet
& Hecla rock but it is in neglig
ible quantities. In fact, experi
ments during the past two or
three years convince the. manage
ment of the parent property that
It would y not pay to attempt to
recover the chemical.-
SOUTH PRESCOTT
DISTRICT YIELDS
RICH GOLD ORE
JEROME, June 7. Rich samples of
gold ore were brought to the cityl
late yesterday afternoon by R. E.
Moore and Ed Rucker, president and
secretary respectively of the Grand
Island Mining company. ' The speci
mens were procured from the district
south of Prescott which the local
mining men maintain, is the largest
gold district in the Btate.
The mining men have spent several
days inspecting the Octave, Rich Hill
and Congress Junction districts. At
the present time there is little activity
in that section, the larger companies
confining their operations to assess
ment work and some little develop
ment. There is said to be a little
placer mining, carried' on principally
by Mexicans and Chinese.
In the opinion of the local men,
some of the largest gold mines in the
history of the state will be developed
eventually in the vicinity of Octave
and Weaver. The Octave property Is
literally a mountain of gold ore, some
reports estimating the ore in sight at
7,000,000, tons The main ledge is
visible on the surface for a distance
of a mile, and at no place is it less
than ten inches in width, the average
width ranging from 16 inches to two
There is one serious handicap to
the development of the region. The
prospects can only be , bandied by
large capital. Huge sums will be re
quired to construct roads into the
belt, and enormous expenditures will
be necessary to develop water to carry
on the operations. It is reported that
the Octave mine, which is backed by
big interests, is to resume active op
erations in the near future. The
plant and equipment has been placed
in the best of condition and a small
crew of emn employed.

ES INTERESTED
IN FREIGHT RATE
HEARING JUNE 13
Protest of American Mining
Congress Against Raise
Will be Heard
WASHINGTON, D. G., June 7.-A
hearing on proposed freight rate In
creases involving vast sums and af
fecting the raw material movements
of the country is scheduled before the
western freight traffic committee in
Chicago, June 13.
The American Mining Congress se
cured a postponement of this hearing
from May 13 under a protest filed at
the May hearing, by the attorneys for
the congress, setting forth that the
business of mining or rare and semi
rare minerals i already overburdened
and the industry facing a negative
market .
Furthermore, the congress, set forth
the principle involved is revolution
ary and unfair. The Denver district
traffic committee asked that the ex
isting rule in vogue on the Colorado
and Southern railroad be made a
permanent order. Under the ruling
the established practice of advance
declaration of release on transporta
tion liabilities above $20 per ton on
low grade and $100 per ton on high
grade ores, concentrates, acids, . pow
ders, etc., is abolished and freight be
charged at one percent of actual value
above $100. The committee went be
yond this, to declare the right of the
common carriers to collect upon the
value as indicated by smelter or sales
reports and to make especial assay
where questions arise.
Attorneys for the mining congress
found that what 'appeared to be a
local matter was to be used as a basis
for a general western ruling and the
matter has been called to the atten
tion of the interests involved. A del
egation of operators from Colorado
and other points will attend the Chi
cago hearing and Secretary J. F. Call-
breath, of the raining congress, will
present the case for the industry, ask
ing that the ruling be jiot granted.

Silver Jfibilee
DENVER, Colo., June 7. A "Myste
rious white metal' 'was discovered in
the Clear creek district of this state
in 1SS2. The country was wild with
gold excitement and little come ot
the discovery until two years later
when a scientist announced that the
white metal which came with the gold
was silver. In 1869 a great lode was
opened In the Caribou mine and from
that discovery there developed a rush
for the silver districts. Colorado be
came a mecca for the second pilgrim
age of prospectors and investors.
Caribou became the second city in
size in Colorado and later Silverton,
Leadville, Aspen and other camps de
veloped and brought silver production
up to such a figure that until 1895
silver surpassed gold as a Colorado
resource. Now the fiftieth anniver
sary of the establishment? of silver
production is being organized by the
Boulder County branch of the Ameri
can Mining congress and the rehabl
tation of silver upon a money making
basis will make the celebration of na
tional interest Clear creek, Boulder
County, Gilpin County, Leadville, As
pen and other districts are "coming
back" strong numberless old and
abandoned mines are being reopened,
towns and cities begin to take on
metropolitan airs, and hope, which
for many years bad no place in the
hearts of the older miners, is taking
possession of the communities where
silver is the basic industry. The an
nouncement of Senator FSttman,
father of the dollar silver bill that the
white metal is good for twenty years
of prosperity at a high price is ac

AUSTRALIAN SCHEME
TO AID SOLDIERS IS
DECLARED THE BEST
SYDNEY, June 7. Australia is pre
pared to settle 20,000 soldiers on the
land.
And she is prepared to give each
advances' ranging up to $57000 for pur
chase of stock and machinery..
That's how well Australia thinks'of
her returning fighting men. . ,' .
Her scheme of aid to soldiers Is
declared the best and most compre
hensijre yet evolved. British authori
ties agree to this.
The previsions of land under, this
scheme, the construction of railways
and roads to open it up and the ad
vances for stock and machinery are
calculated to require an outlay of
, 1200,000,000.
Besides this land program
The government will expend $100,
000,000 for public works, on ' which
soldier labor will be. given preference.
It makes an allowance to maintain
each soldier and his family, if he has
one, till he gets work..
It gives to each' Wind soldier a
home, title clear.
It advances any soldier up to-$3300
for a house, with no advance payment,
a program that calls for $250,000,000
of government funds.
It will ask only 5 per cent interest
of soldiers on deferred .. payments,
though the cost to the government
will be six per cent.
The government will buy and divide
large estates and buy building ma
terial to sell to soldiers at cost.
It will give soldiers 20 to 27 years
to make deferred payments.
To prevent speculation in these
Boldier investments, no transfer is
permitted for five years without con
sent of the government commissioner.
All benefits thus aoffered to sold
iers are open to widows of soldiers,
to widowed mothers and to nurses
who went overseas.

KISSING DAY EVENT
: IN ENGLISH VILLAGE
HLWGERFORD, England, June 7.
A curious custom, the Hocktide festi
val of Kissing Day, is observed in
Hungerford. With the exception of
three years of the war, it has been
observed every year 6ince the days
of John ' of Guant, and was revived
this year. With a trumpet 300 years
old, the .' trumpeter opens the day,
blowing it on the balcony of the court
house. The town crier, in red-fatjd
suit rings his bell and calls all oom
nioners to court. The tuttimen, two
villagers, start on their round carry
ing poles to which are affixed' large
bouquets. They enter each shop and
house to colect a one pence fine and
failing in this exact a kiss from the
wife and daughters of each commoner.
Signs of struggle are. frequent, but
each time a kiss is obtained ,an orange
is thrown by a follower to the big
crowd of children that trails along,
and the oranges disappear rapidly.
1700 BRITONS OWN
ONE-THIRD OF ISLES
LONDON, June 7. In England and
Wales, 30,000,000 people own no land
at all, and 1700 persons own 14,000,000
acres, or one-third of the whole. But
this is changing rapidly now with the
government movement for the break
ing up of big estates, and the com
moners'" inclination for confiscation
if the distribution of land is too slow.
One firm of land agents sold 500,000
acres last year and will handle 1,000,
000 acres this year. Business men
who fear heavier income taxes or
capital taxes and land speculators are
heavy buyers, and there is regret at
the tendency to get building site
prices for excellent farm land, in an
ticipation of electric railways to con
nect with cities and villages, but in
the main the big estates are coming
into the' hands of small farmers.

Nearest the Creator
Summer is here.
Most of us are inactive or have a desire to be inactive at thi3 season.
But summer is the most active time of all life.
Most of us are inactive to avoid heat, but heat is the very element
that renders animate every cell of creation.
Some day when the thermometer is about 0 let us go out Into the
orchard or garden any place we are near the Creator.
Let us look around.
' All our senses seeing, hearing, feeling, smelling, thinking will give
evidence of life activity.
The leaves and twigs are soft with new growth.
The insects are flying about.
The air is filled with pollen, the germ, of plant creation.
. Blossoms are forming into fruit.
The fruit is forming and casting seed.
And the very soil gives forth a warm odor in its desire to produce. '
Every cell is life activity.
Nothing is dormant.
The chances are that we man are the most inactive creation in
the whole display.
Summer is the active time of man, bothin mind and body.
It is thinking time as well as doing time.
But this activity does not mean all work and no play.
Summer is the play time, in the open, the time of action and re
action to restore health and strength for the inactive season.
Summer is the time when all lower life stores nutrition and strength
to withstand the rigors of winter.
v
Out in the garden or orchard we will observe that no form of the
many varieties exhibited there is resting. None is looking at the ther
mometer and complaining to its neighbor about the heat.
They are too busy partaking of the heat, the source of life.
All the resting in the garden or orchard is done in winter.
. Summer Is the time of new birth of thought and ideas, and the time
of action in their growth and development.
Why should we man be inactive in summer, seeing that all
nature i3 active?
Let us all go out into the open this summer and think and. work and
play.
Let us not just rest, but rather take example from the instinct of
every living thing about us.
Let us 6eek even a brief change and contrast frcm our shut-in,
year-around occupation in the garden in the fields, nearest the Creator.
The Farm3 Are Calling
Farmers of the country are sending out their annual call for men.
If a man is jobless during these summer months, it must be because
he w ill not take what he can get or because he is not physically' quali
fied for hard labor. The park benches' ought to be free of loafers while
the country's crops are waiting to be harvested.
The best farms of Colorado and the wheat farms of Kansas and
Nebraska are calling for men, offering high wages and advancing railway
fares. In the Pecos valley of New Mexico 400 to 600 farm laborers are
wanted in Chaves and Eddy counties. The Salt River valiey of Arizona
will nee 5000 men this summer. The Yuma valley of Arizona and the
Imperial valley of California have labor shortages and there is no
oversupply of hands even as near El Paso as the upper and lower valleys.
The wheat farmers of Kansas are petitioning the railroad adminis
tration for a special low rate to induce men to go to the Kansas fields.
Southwestern organizations are asking tha bureau of immigration to
permit an influx of Mexican labor under the same conditions as last
year. Everywhere the scale of pay offered is above pre-war rates.
There are special reasons, sometimes, why men cannot perform farm
labor. Put for the most of those who are without employment, antipathy '
to rarm work and a -desire to remain'ln town are not good excuses.
There will be even less reason for unemployment this summer than
usual. El Paso Herald.

' Not "A Mere Matter of Dollars and Cents."
Governor Albert E. Smith, of New York, has signed the W granting
salary increases to 53,000 public school teachers in that state. The bill
establishes the rule of equal pay for women teachers and corrects dis
crimination and raises the salaries an average of $100.
Governor Smith was born in a tenement house in the congested
East Side district of New York. His father was a laborer. The boy
fought his way to the top and became the governor of the Empire state
of the Union. This is what he said to the opponents of the bill:.
"I have yet to meet the tax payer who would admit that the educa
tion of our children should not be put above a mere matter of dollars
and cents. The cost of this measure cannot be spoken of in the same
breath as that of road improvement, canal construction and other activi
ties of the state, for which many millions are appropriated. The public
schools must be adequately supported if hey are to remain the bulwark
ot the ration and their success is dependent upon" the number and the
ability of the teachers of the future." Arizona Record.
If the league plan can't stand the test of a referendum, it has a fat
chance of binding this nation to an everlasting interest in Europe's affairs.
Judging from his comment on the peace terms. Heine expected the
world to give him some sort of medal for distinguished service.
Brockdorff-Rantzau says that he came to Versailles with the hope
that the days of scraps ot paper had passed. Well, we did our part to
make them pass.
The Hun is afraid the peace terms will moan perpetual unemploy
ment. They won't if he hustles hard enough to meet the payments on
that indemnity.
The country will have a better chance to understand the league
covenant when senators got over the Idea that determination is argument.
The Big Four have decided that the best aid to clear thinking in
Germany is the blockade.
The High Cost ot Living lias been invented since the day when a
prominent citizen could wear a patch on the seat of his pants without
arousing comment.
The reason a man fcnrj that his mischief loviiiR little son won't
. turn' out ' right is urease N; lias forgotten what a little devil he was
at that age.
Philosophers tell us thai wo attain happinebs by living inside our
selves. We get more of it by living outside our incomes.
Acting Governor Issues Boy Scout
Proclamation; Woman Secty. Attests
This proposal to (Vnl the Bolshevik! is much like pouring oil on
flames to keep theul from destru ini;
The following proclamation for the
observance of ( "Boy Scout Week,"
which begins today, has the novel
features of not only being issued by
au acting governor acting for an act
ing governor, but of being the first
document of its kind ever issued in
Arizona to be attested by a woman
secretary of state. The proclamation
is signed by R. E. McGillen, acting
governor in the absence of f Acting
Governor Mitt Sims, who was acting
governor for Governor Campbell dur
ing the governor's absence to greet
Arizona's returning war veterans in
New York, but who left the state
shortly after the governor did. As
Sims was also secretary of state, the
proclamation is attested by Harriet
Jean Oliver, Arizona's first woman
acting secretary of state.
The proclamation in part is as fol
lows: PROCLAMATION OF BOY SCOUT
WEEK
"America's future depends upon its
boys. The congress of the United
States, recognizing the value of proper
training of American boyhood, granted
a special charter for the organization
of the Boy Scouts of America. In this
forward movement have enlisted 375,
000 of the 10,000,000 American boys
between 12 and 21 years of age who
ought to be given the benefit of Boy
Scout discipline .training and prac
tice. "The Boy Scouts raised several hun-
j dred million dollars in the Liberty loan
and War Savings Stamps campaigns.
They did splendid work for the Red
Cross in its several national com
paigns. They served the government
in many other effective ways during
the great world war.
- ' In Arizona there are approximately
S62 registered Boy Scouts and about
20,435 boys of Scout age. A great
work has, therefore, just begun, and!
what is true in this state applies with
equal force to the rest of the nation. !
"The plan, therefore, for a Boy
Scout week during w hich universal ap
peal Will be' made to all Americans to
supply the means to put the Boy
Scouts of America in a position to
carry forward effectively and contin
uousiy me spienuia .work tnev are
doing for the youth of America, should
have the unreserved support of the
nation. "
"Now, therefore, I. R. E. McGillen,
acting governor of the state of Ari
zona, by virtue of the authority vest
ed in me by law do hereby recommend
that the period beginning Sunday,
June 8th to Flag Day, June 14, 1919,
be observed .as. Boy Scout week
throughout the state of Arizona for
the purpose of strengthening the
work of the Boy Scouts of America.
"And I earnestly recommend that in
every community a citizens' commit
tee be organized to co-operate in par
rying out a program for a definite rec
ognition of the effective services ren
dered by the Boy Scouts of Ame.ca;
and sincerely hope that all who can,
will enlist for personal service in con
nection with the promotion of this
most worthy cause and give all pos
sible financial assistance to this meri
torious organization of American boy
hood.
"In Witness Whereof, I 'have here
unto set.my hand and paused the great
seal of the State of Arizona to be af
fixed. " '

Sisbee Improvement Co. THE BISBEE DAILY REVIEW, SUNDAY, JUNE 8, 1919
FIVE
Musical Season Op&ned
By Treble Clef Club
One of the most enjoyable pro
grams of the seasou was that pre
sentee) at the high school auditorium
Wednesday evening when the Treble
Clef club made , its formal bow to
Bisbee music lovers. Much credit
Is due the members of the organiza
tion and their capable director, Mrs.
Charlotte Adams Gill, for the per
formance. While it savored of the
beginning of a well directed plan, the
work was exceptionally well done.
Hardly expecting perfection in a
group which has been working but
three months, one was surprised to
find such a degree of balance, volume
and shading. The group of piano
numbers, contributed by Mrs. Sam
Frankenberg, added rare enjoyment
to the program..
More significant thanthe mere
single program, however, is the fact
that the work has been initiated ard
that the plan has had opportunity to
present itself in a tangible way to
the listeners Wednesday evening. And
the forecast can be made with a cer
tain promise that the plan will be
carried foreward. .
Although the present effort is di
rected toward a women's choral or
ganization, a similar group of male
voices is included in the plan. These
groups may be used separately or in
combination throughout the coming
season as the more pretentious suc
ceed the present lighter numbers. A
series of program recitals will be fea
tured in which the members of the or
ganizations will have a part.
Among the soloists in Wednesday
evening's program were Misses Jean
Bertonneau, Anne Wallace, Eleanor
Jack. Albright and Mrs. Parks, each
of whom interpreted the passages
with clear understanding. Miss Alice
Wilson and a corp of young ladies
served as ushers. Miss Blair was at
the piano.
tained at a tea. White roses were
used on the table and the place cards
were decorated in blue an yellow.
Invited to pay the farewell compli
ment to Mrs. Addis, were Mesdames
Mitchell, Fox, Ware, Hondrum, Lewis,
Hodges, Plummer and the Misses Fox

LAST CHANCE
On Silver Cycle; Snares at $1.50
SILVER CYCLE is a sensational stock BECAUSE it is in the
SENSATIONAL neighborhood-, IN BLOCK 75.
The least bit of extra news of new 'levolopmert will be the r.-.eans
of taking up every share that is offered at $1.50.
WE BELIEVE THAT NEWS IS NOW ON THE STREET
It came over the wire, is absolutely authentic and reads as
follows: '
"Wichita Falls, June 2. Meadows Barker well in
Block 75, adjoining Silver Cycle on the east, came
in today with a good flow of oil. The well has not' yet
been fully completed and the drillers say it "will be a
'sensational well. P. J. McKeown."
This telegram in reference to the MEADOWS BARKER will
mean the heavy buying of SILVER CYCLE and should over
subscribe the reservations which Brokers are offering at $1.50.
Just how much of the stock can be bought EVEN NOW at 51.50,
is hard to estimate' and many are holding it for higher prices.
SILVER CYCLE SHOULD BE SELLING at a price SOMEWHERE
NEAR her rich neighbors. i
UNITED OIL is doing today what SILVER CYCLE ought to be
doing a short time from now.. UNITED OIL is sending out
dividend checks of 75 per cent. SILVER CYCLE is 200 YARDS
FROM UNITED OIL. '
GOLDEN CYCLE adjoining SILVER CYCLE is not only drilling
another well but is repairing the damage done by fire on her
first will. THEY tefl us that the GOLDEN CYCLE'S first well
is really BIGGER THAN THE BURK-WAGGONER.
SUMMIT PET. Oil adjoining SILVER CYCLE brought in a
BIG WELL last week which started the ball rolling for SILVER
CYCLE.
MEADOWS BARKER the news just received on MEADOWS
BARKER should sell every share in sight of SILVER CYCLE
and we doubt if 25,000 SHARES can be bought from all the
brokers combinid.
SILVER CYYCLE OIL COMPANY, headed by J. A. D. Smith, who
put OCEAN OIL 'on the map, is a REAL OIL COMPANY. This
company already has production, in the "shallow' fields. This
.company owns over 500 acres. Us capitalization of $150,000 war
rants the Company in guaranteeing the drilling of Three Wells on
their acreage in Block 75. SILVER CYCLE OIL COMPANY IS
TODAY DRILLING THE FIRST ONE IN BLOCK 75.. SMITH
believes that this first well wilt be "in" by the 17th of this month.
IT SHOULD BE A BIG WELL.
THE COMPANY HAS ANNOUNCED THAT ON JUNE 17TH THEY
WILL LIST THEIR SHARES ON THE EL PASO STOCK EX
CHANGE AT $3.00 A SHARE
(On the same date they will apply for listing on the New York
Curb and the Los Angeles Stock Exchange).
WE BELIEVE that the market on SILVER CYCLE will be above
$3.00 before the 17th. THE LAW OF SUPPLY AND DEMAND
should place this stock at HIGHER FIGURES.
WE BELIEVE when the Company brings in their well in Block 75
that the SHARES WILL SELL AT 10 FOR 1.
THIS IS OUR VIEWPOINT. Looking at it from a Broker's
standpoint we have been favored in our judgment of STOCKS and
we have no hesitancy in recommending the immediate purchase
BY WIRE OF SILVER CYCLE AT $1.50 FOR A 10 TO 1
POINT RISE.
WE SAY WIRE YOUR ORDERS, BECAUSE those who order by
mail will stand a good cbancevof having their money returned.

MILLION DOLLAR
APPROPRATO
Monthy Reports Show Accurately How Every Cent Is Spent,
How Dollar's Worth Is Assured For Every Dollar Of
Fund Outlayed; Figures Show Drainage Is
One Of The Biggest Items Of Cost
Total expenditure of the Cochise
County Highway commission up to
and including April 30, according to
the engineer's report to the commis
sion, was $290,501.72, including ex
penditures on all highways on which
the commission is working. .This re
port id issued by the commission
monthly, and is placed in the hand 3
of the board of supervisors as soon as
prepared. Following are expenditures
to data and the totals appropriated
from th.e bond issue for each project:

Cochise-Peajce highway
19,902.25 75,000.00
Totals $290,501.72 $1,000,000.00
In making the report the commis
sion includes all expenditures on each
section of the highways on which it
is working up to the date of the re
port. Details of the expenditures can
be obtained from a glance at the re
port, so that the members of the com
mission .and the board of supervisors
are always in close touch with the ex
penditures of the engineering office.
Such expenditures, however, are ap
proved by the members of the com
mission before the warrants are is
sued, and in most instances before
debts are contracted. N-
On the Bisbee-Douglas highway,
section one, total expenditures to date
have been $59,92S.76. These are dis
tributed among the items, engineering
survey, inspection, office engineering,
right of way, materials in suspense,
grading, culverts, bridges ditching and
advertising for bids. The largest of
these items is for bridges .which total
$16,586.12. Materials in suspense
total next at $16,034.31, while culverts
cost $12,999.56. Grading, which 'ordi
narily is one of the greatest items of
expense in this section cost onlj
$9,85; .13.
Tho costs of bridges and culverts on
this section is an illustration of what
the commission has had to face in the
matter of drainage. Of the total ex
pended so far on the section almost
one-half has been for this item alone,
and the ttire stretch from Douglas
to Bisbee demands a similar appro
tionment of moneys to take' care of
the water'aroblem. One of the chier
aims of the' commission has been to
construct a highway which will at all
times withstand the high waters
which surge from the great areas
which' drain onto this road. Conse
quently the expense for this part of
the construction has been high.
On the Bisbee-Douglas roa'd, esction
two, total expenditures to date have
been $30,405.20, of which the largest
item by far is for grading, which
reached $18,902.08, more than one-half
of what has been expended. Work on
this section has not been prosecuted
as far as on the other two.
Total costs to date on the Bisbee
Douglas highway, section three, has
reached $32,797.48, with grading again
the high item at $13,810.54. On this
stretch the costs of culverts to date
have been $676.73 and that of bridges
$1,368.67. Paving enters into the re
port in this section for the first time,
with a total cost of $1,65S.22 to April
30, for items of salary for inspection
and sub-grading, the latter including
practically all this cost.
The Douglas east section number
one, had cost to date $952.SS section
two had cost $6,672.44, the Silver
Creek bridge had cost $741.75, and
the third section of the same highway
had cost $952.90. Of these section
two had been furthest advanced in
work at the time of report.
The Bisbee-Lowell paving has been
completed for some time, but is in
cluded in the report because it is a
part of the commission expenditures
to the date of the report. The fea
ture of thi3 item is that while a total
of $9,000 was appropriated for the
work, it was completed for practically
$3000 less than had been anticipated,
or for $6,322.54, the largest item of
which was $5,872.54, which was for
paving.
On the Tombstone-Benson highway,
section 1-A had cost $1,019.16; section
1-B, $17,161.82, and section 1-C,
$22,030.48. At the time of this report
the highway was not omre' than hair
completed over these sections. Since
it has been practically completed, and
much of it is thrown open to traffic.
Section two of the same highway had
cost to date $24,725.39, while section
three had cost $34,956.18. These two
sections ' like the first, have been
practically completed since this report
was made and are being used in large
part
On the Cochise-Pearce highly,
section one, total costs to date have
been $12,093.17, of which the largest
item, or $5,676.64 is for grading. Sur
facing cost $1,021.17, and dips exceed
ed this item with a cost of $1,661.52.
Section two had cost' $6,296.36, grad
ing totalling $4,200.49 and surfacing
11,222.66,
The overhead expense of the com
mission to the date of report had been
$3,407.54, most of which went for
clerks' salary, office rent, supplies and
printing. Engineering expense for the
office was $2,920.74; for tests, $179.77,
and for engineering $7,509.26. The
total overhead to date from these
items had reached only $14,017.31,
which has been apportioned between
the projects in proportion to the cost
of each section.
Equipment of the commission on
hand includes materials and supplies
of a total value of $18,655.81, of which
$13,443.67 is for water pipe. This item
is apportioned to the various projects.
The outstanding feature of the re
port is the manner in which items are
set down so that they give a detailed
idea of where the money is going and
for what expenditures are made. Com
parisons of the reports from month
to month . are sufficient to convince
anyone that the commission is get
ting the most possible for every dollar
spent.
AUTO CLUB TO SHOW
MOTION PICTURES FOR
GOOD ROADCAMPAIGN
Striking Film, Produced by
U. S. Gov't, to be Seen
In Bisbee Soon
Phone it to The Review if
it's news.
Perhaps the greatest problem fac
ing the American public today is the
betterment of the nation's system of
highways. Evidence of this lies in
the government's vast interest in the
several campaigns which have been
started to arouse the public to a reali
zation of their neglect.
One of the most important steps in
this campaign has been the introduc
tion of a motion picture film on Good
Roads, which, has reecived the sup
port of practically every government
al official who is interested in the
movement . This film will be shown
in this city at the Eagles theater
within a few day3 under the auspices
of M. W. Powell, secretary of the
Warren District Automobile club.
It was produced by the industrial
department of the Universal Film
Manufacturing company, under the
personal direction of Harry Levey,
manager of that department, and with
the hearty support of Mr. Carl Laem-
mle, president of the company. It
was made afc the request of Winsor
T. White, head of the White Motor
company, of Cleveland.
Its message is so startingly trans
mitted, and so strikingly impressive,
that many important national, state
and municipal officials have given it
their heartiest support Among these
are Francis M. Hugo, secretary ot
state ot New York; Chas. Henry
Davis, president of the National High
ways association; Austin F. Bement,
vice president of the Lincoln Highway
association; Lee Lamar Robinson, of
the highway transport committee of
the council of national defense; G.
P. Coleman, chairman of the American
Association of State Highway offi
cials; V, D. L. Robinson, secretary
of the Dixie Highway association.
In a letter to Mr. Levey, Mr. Robin
son said in part:
"No greater thing . can be accom
plished for this nation at the preesnt
time than to visualize, as you pro
pose to do in your campaign to the
entire American people, the need of
development of highways transport to
its fullest extent. We would be very
pleased, indeed, to co-operate with you
in the furtherance of your campaign."
Of f iicals who are boosting the Good
Roads film are firm believers in the
theory that highways transport
proved its right to a place of equality
with the rail and water ways of the
nation, during the war. It is held
that highways transport should be
given a corner of the transportation
trinity in the mind of the American
people, and the film campaign start
ed by Universal helps to bear this
message.
Among the men prominent in high
way improvement movements who
are interested in, the motion picture
campaign is C. P. Coleman, chairman
of the American Association of State
Highway officials. He ha3 taken a
personal interest in the success of
the film drive and has expressed him
self as follows:
"My association will be glad to co
operate with your department in
every way posible. I would suggest
that you get in touch with the high
way commissioners in each state.
They, I am sure, will be glad to lend
their co-operation." '
With the sanction and support of
the various officials who have seen It,
this production will be made the ob
ject of a nation-wide campaign In
theaters and before various other or
ganizations. Universal will give It
the full benefit of ita large dlstribu-

Ford Motor company are establishing
assembling plants in Copenhagen, Den
mark and in Cadiz, Spain.
The Ford Motor company believes
the war is over, that a new dispensa
tion has been established, and that the
sooner American manufacturers can
align themselves to the new condi
tions and reach out to meet the great
demands of the world, why, the quick
er the havoc wright by the war will
have been effaced. The quicker we
can get international business at work,
the sooner will the horrors of the war
disappear and the earlier we can reach
out our hand of trade to help, tne
earlier will be the disappearance of
hat and enmity between people.
: The Ford Motor company believes
if you want the foreign market, go
to it Don't wait for it to come to
you. Take what you have to sell to
the market, and there show its advant
ages to the people who visit that mar
ket and to the people who buy in that
market. If you wish foreign trade, be
come an active, living part in the rea
blood of that trade. The whole word
is a. market today for American en
terprise, and who realize this truth
and make honest efforts to get that
trade, will have it
in such a manner that the spectator
is rudely jolted into the realization
that it lies within his power to de
mand that such conditions be bet
tered. And that is the purpose of the
production.
NEW BORN BABIES IN
FAR EAST ARE SALTED
SALONIKA, June 7. American Red
Cross workers in eastern Europe and
Asia Minor are finding strange cus
toms. One is the salting of new-born
babies. Armenians and reeks cover
the body of a new T&ny with fine salt
and leave it three hours, then wash
it with warm water. But some of the
mountain tribes of Asia Minor keep
the baby in pickle 24 hours. Health
and. strength is believed to lie m the
treatment, and beside it keeps away
evil spirits," the mothers believe.

In an interesting and entertaining

impressive manner, it sets forth the
reasons that America needs better
highways. It shows main traveled
thoroughfares which are little better
than mud holes, and shows pavements
upon which thousands of dollars were
spent, and which have crumbled away
after only a few years' use.
One of the great reasons for Ameri

TALKING ABOUT STORAGE BATTERIES
The Philadelphia Diamond Grid Starting Battery is a quality pro
duct It is built upon the principle that only the" best is good
enough. ...
The Diamond Grid used in the plates is twice as expensive to
manufacture as the horizontal bar grid ordinarily used, but the Dia
mond Grid alone is strong enough to resist warping and buckling.
Philadelphia active material costs 20 per cent more than ordinary
active material, but Philadelphia active material last3 much longer.
Philadelphia wood separators are made of hard wood. This wood
is quarter sawed. Of course, quarter sawed wood adds considerably
to- the cost, but quarter sawed wood means low internal resistance
and therefore snappy starting ability. Moreover, quarter sawed wood
cannot be crushed by the pressure, of the plates.
Philadelphia moulded rubber covers cost twice as much as ordi
nary sheet and asphalt covers, but Philadelphia moulded covers pro
vide twice the gas space, and support the terminal posts securely.
No danger of electrolyte boiling or leaking out with Philadelphia
covers.
Philadelphia filler caps are generously large. Th'eneavy bayonet
catch makes them easy to remove and replace. Only a quarter turn
is required. The filling aperture is large and accessible. The bottom
of tie tube shows exactly how high to filL There is no guess-worK
in filling Philadelphia batteries.
Philadelphia terminals and connectors are large and strong. Th'e
strap posts are provided with rings similar to the rings on high ten
sion insulators. By packing the space between the cover and post
rings with a sealing compound, creepage of acid is eliminated.
Other items could be mentioned. The jars have a tensile strength
of 3,600 pounds per square inch. The -wood cases are thoroughly acid
proofed hard wood. The handles are bolted, not screw on. No mat
ter what part you examine, you will find that quality predominates.
As a result the Philadelphia Diamond Grid battery will endure more
hard work and more abuse than any other battery ever built.

WEEKLY REVIEW
NEW YORK, June 7 Apprehen
sion regarding the money situation in
respect to a possibl escarcity of funds
for speculative purposes was discern
ible constantly in the financial district
this week.
Professional traders favoring a con
tinuation of the rise in share prices
that has been in progress in recent
months was disconcerted Tuesday
when banks called loans and the rate
of collateral jumped ta 11 per cent, a
new high figure for the year, and a
sharp bseak occurred during which
some stocks sold off from 10 to 17
points in a 2,000,000 share day.
This liquidation gave rise to con -
jectures as to whether it was enf ore-
ed or natural. On the. one hand cpin -
ion was expressed that money loaning
banks had raised the rate on the
promise that the speculation had be -
come excessive and unhealthy, and
there were reports that the so-called
money committee would be establish
ed again with a view to controlling the
situation. On the other hand it was
pointed out that Victory loan and in
come tax payments were consuming
the money ordinarily available for
stock market purposes.
There was no confirmation of the
money committee report and the loan
rate returned to the figure that had
been normal, 6 per cent. By the close
of the week the losses of Tuesdav
had been more than recovered, with
prices showing a general upward Marine pfd 120

During the last part of the day, how
ever, week-end adjustment of trades
led to rallies in which the September
option was most conspicuous.
Oats were swayed in the main by
the action of corn. Some improvement
of domestic shipping call was noted.
Changes in the value of provisions
appeared to depend to a great extent
on the course of grain, rather than on
the hog market. Lard and ribs show

AKRON'. O.. June 7. Within a year
if plans of Akrcn promoters hold true.
Riant passenger dirigibles will leave
their hangars here, bound for New
York, Chicago, Omaha, Canada, Flor
ida, Texas and the Pacific coast.
And if these flights are successful
and the monetary returns are suffi
cient work will start upon giant air
ships, even larger than the Zeppelins,
capable of crossing the Atlantic, and
a regular passenger service will be
established between New York and
London.
These are not dreams. They are
the plans of veterans of air naviga
tion, men who have spent years pilot
ing balloons, airships and airplanes,
and backed by a corporation that has
been making dirigibles for years.
A dirigible 300 feet long, capable
' of traveling 75 miles an hour in favor
able weather, and 50 miles an hour
in windy weather will open daily ser
vice between Akron and Cleveland, O.,
a distance of 33 miles. ;
This, however, is but the trial ser
vice. If this proves successful, the
service will be extended, first to New
York and Chicago, and then through
out the United States.
Landing places will be obtained in'
the very heart of these cities, prob-!
ably on the roofs of the tallest hotels. !
Unlike airplanes, which need a large i
landing place the airships need JSut
a small platform upon which to dock.
This was demonstrated jecentlyj
when a ICO-fcot army dirigible from
the naval station at Wingfoot Lake,,1
Akron, landed two pasengers on a 30 ;
foot platform on the roof of the Hotel
Statler, Cleveland. The airship was
160 feet long. - i
The -first of this fleet of air line
will carry 12 passengers.
It is now under construction at the
plant of the Goodyear Tire & Rubber
Co., pioneers in the manufacture of
airships and makers of a large per
centage of the 'blimps" and dirigibles!
that were used by the United States
during the world war.
Many secrets of the government,
perfected during the war, have been
placed at the disposal of the rubber
firm:
Promoter Long in Air Flight Game
The promoters of the airship pas-!
senger line are Ralph II. Upnon, for
years aeronautical engineer at the
Gcodyear plant, holder of the James
Gordon Bennett balloon trophy in 1914
and V. C. Young, veteran balloon nav
igator. They are being given both financial
and mechanical support by the Good
year Tire & Rubber Co.
The dirigibles will be- from 30 to
800 feet in length. They will 'carry
from 12 to 100 passengers. The ex
press airships will carry about 100
tons of express. . .
It is estimated that the trip to New
York, about 600 miles, could be made"
in eight hours. It now takes aobut 16 1
hours. A trip to San Francisco, over!
2000 miles, and now taking four days,!
could be accomplished in about 50
hours.
Rates, it is estimated, will be about
three times the railroad fare.
Besides the fleet of air liners, the
company has also under course of
erection a sport model 'dirigible. It's
cost will be but J8000. It will be
about 90 feet long, contain 35,000 cu
bic feet of gas. The motor will be
able to go a maximum of 70 miles an
hours, but the 'average speed will be
50 miles.
It will seat but two persons.

Dodge Corporation at Dawson. New
Mexico, makes an interesting compari
son, because .good housing in coal
mining camps is unusual. This com
pany adopted its standard two years
before the government undertook to J
make any standards. All of the fea-l

government construction are included!
iu the 'Dawson housing, and in many
cases they have been improved upon.
While the government requires 20 feet1

30 feet between buildings and a 90

Traditionally, coal minlne camos

sanitary conditions, and while the
camps of Virginia and Pennsylvania
are gradually folowing the pace set
them by the western camps, the pro
gres8iveness o fthe west is illustrated
by the fact that their housing stan
dards of years back are even better
than those set by the government as
an objective, and regarded by eastern
industry as almost revolutionary. I
