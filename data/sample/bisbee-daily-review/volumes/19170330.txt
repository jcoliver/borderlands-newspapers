Chamberlain Tells President
He Has Power to Bring
Army and Militia To War
Strength Immediately.
PRESIDENT FAVORS
UNIVERSAL SERVICE
But Has Not Announced,'
Which Plan He May Ask
Congress To Pass. Sup

(By Review LeaseC Wire)
WASHINGTON', Mar. 29. Plans to
forward further preparedness meas
ures tor the army began to assume
definitet form today.
How an Increased army force may
be promptly secured for the present
emergency as well as universal train-1
ins: as a national policy were discuss
ed by President Wilson with Senator j
Chambeilam of Oregon, chairman of
same time Secretary Baker and ad
ministration leaders in congress con
sidered legislation needed immediate
ly for the military establishment.
Senator Chamberlain told the
President he believed the execu
tive now has authority without
further action by congress to
raise at once an army oi more
than 700,000 wen, by increasing
the regular army to war strength
and calling out all of the national
guard at war strength.
..There was no intimation that the
President was considering such a
step immediately, but the whole field
of measures necessary, to secure a
larger force was discussed.
To Offer Old Army Bill
For present needs the war depart
ment has decided. Secretary Baker
said, to submit to congress a budget
containing virtually the same provis
ions as the regular army appropria
tion bill which failed at the last ses
sion. Another Bill Later
Estimates for the expense In con
nection with an enlarged army or for
any emergency activities will be pre
sented later. This decision coincides
with the house plan to re-enact the
appropriation bill without change and
send it at once to the senate.
Senator Chamberlain also agreed
to expedite the bill in the senate. To
this end he said he would not again
offer his universal training bill as a
rider if it would delay prompt action
on the supply measure.
Favors Universal service
The conference between the Presi
dent and Senator Chamberlain, at the
latter's request, was primarily to dis
cuss the senator's universal training
tlan. He asked the President to en
dorse the general principle of com
pulsory training in bis forthcoming
coming message to congress. The
President, it was said, gave no indi
cation of his probable course. He was
raid to favor some plan for providing
military training, but was non-committal
regarding the Chamberlain
plan, to which he is understood to
have some objections.
After leaving the White House the
senator said he "was still hopeful" of
administration endorsement of his
bill and predicted the passage by the
senate of some sort of universal train
in;; measure.
Plant to Drill 500,000
Another amendment, the
senator i
said, would be. to create 36 divisions
in the country for the segregation of
the training work with facilities for
training an army division of from 22,
000 to 27.000 men in each divisional
camp. While some of the divisions.
Senator Chamberlain thought, would
have larger bodies under training
than others, be believed at least 500,
000 young men would be thus secured.
Oppose Staff Bill
The Oregon senator impressed up- j
on the President that his plan would i
not entail the enormous expense of
the army general staff training bill.
He estimated that without providing
costly permanent barracks at train
ing camps and by having the students
llv in tents tbe s usual cost of train

RAIDER MOEWE HOLDS
AMERICAN PRISONER
COPENHAGEN", March 29. (via
London) Twenty two neutrals who
were brought to Germany on the com
merce raider Moewe as prisoners, in
cludeing one American, arrived here
today from Kiel.
. The sailors brought an account of
a hard engagement between the Me
we and the British steamer Otaki on
March 10.
The Otaki, according to the sailors,
surrendered only after scoring seven
hits on the Moewe and setting the
German raider on fire. The blaze was
not extinguished for three days. Six
01 lne Moewe crew and two captive
Hindus were killed during the fight
while the Otaki lost her captain, a
mate, ber engineer and two soilors.
During the engagement, the sailers
said, tbe British prisoners on the
Moewe broke the iron grating barring
the room in which they were confined,
but they were overawed by sailors
from the Moewe with hand grenades.
The neutral prisoners, confined in an
other quarter of the ship spent an
anxious time during the engagement
knowing that if the M'oewe were sunk
they would go down with her. One
shell penetrated the hull of the Moewe
passing barely two feet below the
quarters of the neutral prisoners.
The Moewe's return from her cruis
ing ground in tbe South Atlantic, it
wag added, was without further incident.

GERMANS STAND FIRM
ON HINDENBURG LINE
WITH THE BRITISH ARMIES IN
FRANCE, via London, Mar. 29. The
warfare on the western front is be
coming somewhat stationary . again,
as the British outposts and patrols
have come face to face with the so
called Hindenberg line, where the
Germans undoubtedly will make a
t determined stand. Their position is
strong, so the problem again arises
of smashing down this defense with ar
tillery.
Minor actions continue all along the
line between the German rear guard
machine gun detachments and the '
British infantry and cavalry patrols
but nothing like a battle has yet de
veloped, i
The Germans' heavy artillery is
coming into play again from fixed po
sitions, north of the Cambrai-St. Quen

President, Showing Future
Peril of America.
(By Review Leased Wire)
WASHINGTON, Mar. 29.
While it is assumed from the de
, fensive measures already taken
by the military arm of the govern
ment. President Wilson in ad
dressing congress next week will
ask for war against Germany, or
a declaration that a state of war
exists, it is known he wMI speak
along broad lines, dealing lightly
with incidents leading up to the
present crisis.
Officials feel that the time is past
when incidentals should be dicusd.
and henceforth that only fundamental
questions of both present and future
American safety should be consider
ed. As a result the President is gatli
ering opinions and suggestions from
all sides as to the sort of an address
to make in the coming crucial hour.
C'use For War is Clear
Tlje general situation has not
been changed by the peo ? of
the German chancellor, von Reth
mannHolwegg. today. a-eordins
to the view tonight of ofTklal.
Germany, it was said, has con
sistently attempted to lay the
blame for her acts on other nat
ions. On previous occasions Pres
ident Wilson has taken the posi
tion that Germany is in no way
justified in carrying on submarine
ruthlessness because of the Brit
ish blockade.
One Way Only to Peace
Only complete abandonment r
unrestricted submarine warfare
could change the attitude of the
United States, it has been said
semi-on'icially recently, and pres
reports indicate that the Cerman
chancellor did not even discuss
that possibility.
To Draft Message Soon
The President will meet with tbe
cabinet tomorrow for the last time
before beginning the actual writing
of his messaue to consress, and there
fore it is expected the German situa
tion will be denlt with very fully.
The attitude of both congress and
public opinion is sought in order fo
present both as fully as possible. s
to the former, the President Is anx
ious to transgress the constitutional
perogatives of congress as the war
making body. It is realized that in
the ultimate analysis the responsibil
ity for decision rests there.
America United
Public opinion it was said, as in
dicated by clipping from newspapers
in all parts of the country, unmistak
ably lavors decisive action. IV1IU
erency is not confined to the Atlantic
and Pacific sections if opinions gath
ered by the administration are a true
index. Demand for action on tbe part
of congress and th President comes
also from the interior section be
tween the Alleghanies and the Sierras
The views represented by some nild
western congressmen as to the apa
thy or their constituents is considered
more local than general.
Kaiser Must Go
The greatest point under considera
tion by the administration is whether
Germany has not unmistakably
shown, through a long succession of
violations of international law. that
the United States must definitely
unite with the liberal democracies of
the world against the four most com
plete autocracies both for its present
and its future safety. All hope has
been lost, as shown in the note to
Germany as to the treaty of 1S2S. in
the good faith of the present German
rulers. The Belgian invasion and de
portations, the ruthlessness submar

the basis of irrational regulation.
"Commissioners and other public of
ficials must be measurably responsive
to public sentiment. Popular opinion
has been largely shaped by sensational
events which have aroused indigna
tion or misunderstanding.
"If the railroads suffer, the public
suffers. If railroad service is uninter
rupted the public will benefit. The
public slAnild understand the fact and
theory of railroad management and
the effect of regulation."
Speaking of the "aggression of labor
unions," he continued:
"The railroad managements have
Jived to rue the day of the 'public be
damned' policy of a generation ago.
Let the labor un.'jtis keep on with
their present policy of damning first
the public, then the President, tln-n
congress and finally the supreme
court, and I am sure the public through
their representatives, will tie the labor
unions, hand and foot, in as radical
a manner as the railroads find them
selves today."
TO ASK CONGRESS
FOR WAR TUESDAY
(Continued From Page One)
man military system as at present
directed is a permanent danger to the
world's peace.
More Plots to be Exposed
German plots in this country, run
ning back almost to the beginning of
the war and finally culminating in
the Zimmermann note to ally Mexico
and Japan in a war against this coun
try, are regarded as evidence of the
evil of the German system. The ad
ministration has much material not
yet made public and it is understood,
moreover, that the complete text ol
the Zimmermann note has not been
published. Further disclosures of in
trigues may be expected at any time.
Germany, through the coolness
with which she treated the Presi
dent's proposal to name peace terms,
is felt to be the greatest source of
danger to world pVnce.'' Some' offi
cials here, who felr her original offer
was insincere and merely a play for
domestic consumption, believe her re
fusal to state terms is proof of that
contention.
Must Work With Allies
Full cooperation ) with the allies,
therefore is generally favored as a
necessity to America's future safety.
German victory now, it is said, might
lead to a direct attack on this coun
try later and would at least necessi
tate extensive armament, A deadlock
would be tantamount to a German
victory on the basis tha. while, after
peace, the German union would be
come stronger, the entente might eas
ily fall apart and Germany be left
relatively world supreme.
Military authorities here belfeve
that the most Germany expects now
is a draw. Why sit seems so indif
ferent to this country's entrance into
the war causes much interest. Rome
officials have had predicted for more
than a year that Germany would at
tempt to force this nation into the
conflict at the last moment, in order
that her autocracy miglit save its
face before the people by surrender
ing to the whole world, and because
this country probably would.be a gen
erous enemy.

Sparkling and vivacious merry,
bright, alert a good, clear skin and
a natural, rosy, healthy complexion
are assured only by pure blood. If
only every' man and women could be
induced to adopt the morning inside
bath, what a gratifying change would
take place. Instead or the thousands
of sickly, anemic-looking men, women
and girls, with pasty or muddy com
plexions: instead of the multitudes of
"nerve wrecks." "rundowns," "brain
fags" and pessimists we should see
a virile, optimistic throng of rosy
cheeked people everywhere.
An inside bath is had by drinking
each morning, before breakfast, a
glass of real hot water with a tea
spoonful of limestone phosphate in it
to wash from the stomach, liver, kid
neys and ten yards of bowels the pre
vious day's indigestible waste, sour
fermentations and poisons, thus
cleansing, sweetening and freshening
the entire alimentary canal before
putting more food into the stomach.
Those subject fo sick headache, bil
iousness, nasty breath, rheumatism,
:olds: and particularly those who
have a pallid, sallow complexion and
who are constipated very often, are
urged to obtain a quarter pound of
limestone phosphate at the drug store,
which will cost but a trifle, but is
sufficient to demonstrate the -quick
and remarkable change in both health
and appearance, awaiting those who
practice internal sanitation. We must
remember that inside cleanliness is
more important than outside, because
the skin does not absorb Impurities
to contaminate the blood while- the
pores in the thirty feet of bowels do.

FANNIE WARD STARS

"Witchcraft" Is Name of Ex
cellent Attraction Playing at
Main Street Showhouse.
During the filming of 'the Jesse L.
Lasky production of "Witchcraft" a
Paramount picture which will be seen
at the Eale Theatre today with the
brilliant Fannie Ward in the leading
role, three little five year old girls
were heartbroken at the Lasky studio
on account 'of the aloofness of Miss
Ward and her refusal to play with
them. Miss Ward, as a little child of
twelve, was sitting at a distance from
the three children. They needed a
fourth to complete their game. They
watched Miss Ward for some time,
"ather marveled at her reticence, and
finally one of them came over, put her
hand into Mis8 Ward
.
"Won't you come over i
s and said:
you come over and play with
us, little girl? Your m'Jther won't

EXHIBIT 1: FAIRNESS.
Germany has been accusing the United States and its
people with a violation of neutrality. From the very
inception of the great European struggle; since the first
bushel of wheat was sold to the Allied nations after Aug
ust 1, 1914, the hue and cry from the Teutonic nation.)
has been: "The United States is Unfair." Now comes
disciples of that emminent statesman and wonderworker
George W. P. Hunt and endeavor, by their words, to
emulate Germany.
Principal among the cljarges against Tcm Campbell
and his friends Democratic and Republican has beeu
that he and they are un neutral. Because he and they are
fair, because. he Is willing to give both sides a hearing
and decide, with justice, between them he is unfair. In
fact like the Germans, friend of Governor Hunt recognize
only two positions. A man (or a set of men)) is either
unfair or lie (or they) is for us.' There is no neutral
ground with such people. When a man is fair and hi
judgment fails to appease these disgruntals he is de
dared unfair. Which brings us to the case in point.
Judge Stanford, in the superior court of Maricopa
county, has been patiently sitting upon the bench hearing
the Hunt election case. He has made many rulings and
while the Hunt attorneys were presenting their case 'it
was freely stated, particularly in Bisbee, that Stanford
was deciding for Hunt. Apparently, it was the Judge's
belief, at that lime on the questions brought before him
that the contestant's prayer had the more merit..
We failed to see any paper in the state of Arizona, any
of the "subsidized" organs, skyrocket in their course and
heap upon the tired frame of Judge Stanford any de
r.nnciations. We heard no unfavorable comments regard
ing Judge Stanford among Campbell supporters or his
friends. They did not care to criticize the court on the
grounds that he was unfair, merely because he decided
a point, or several points, against thir favorite's con
tentions. ,
Then Douglas 1 appeared on the horizon. It was a
calm and peaceful horizon when Pearson, Hart, Thaw
and others were brought to the surface. Judge Stanford
heard the testimony of the witnesses and decided against
the attorneys for Hunt. Not being competent to decide
matters of complex law we do not care to approve or
criticize his decision and stop at an approval of the
result which will mean cleaner politics in Arizona. This
stand, however, does not characterize the attitude of the
Hunt supporters.
"Judge Stanford is giving the governorship to Tom
Campbell," shouted one. "There is no justice in Judge
Stanford's court," declared another. Did they stop to
consider fairness? Did they stop to consider that Judge
Stanford is in a position to know of the facts and the
testimony, perhaps better than those who cried "no Jus
tice." It is a disheartening parody on the American spirit
hich is supposed to stand for fairness to witness the
attempts now being made in the state of Arizona to bull
doze the courts. The instance cited above is merely an
example. As a people, we are supposed to be broad;
we are supposed to be ablo to look on both sides of a
question land every question has two Bides) and give our
opponents some credit for at least being sane and bonesu
It is fortunate, perhaps, that the class of people who
adopt such measures are in the great minority. The bal
ance welcome any attempt Uiey may make to "start
something. ,
A court, in order to be fair with the friends of the
former war lord of Florence's summer resort, can only
do one thing; decide all matters effecting them in their
favor. Otherwise that court is "unfair" and dispenses
"no justice."
PHOENIZ AND SUNDAY LAWS.
Phoenix, capital of the state, aud center or one of the
most productive farming areas in the country is a wide
awake, progressive community. It has fine buildings,
pavement for miles, a municipal lighting system second
to none and thousands of excellent citizens. Yet Phoenix
is attempting (or some of its people are) to go back to
Puritanical days and pass a drastic Sunday closing law,
thereby attempting' to legislate on the very intricate sub
ject of Morals.
We welcome any law which makes fur the raiding of
the moral plane of the people of PUoeuix. That would
in time be reflected in every other part of the state
uad tbe benefit would be rreat. To na? a c'ty EtJitu'e,
applicable within the corporate limits of the capital,
however, appears to be short sighted and Ineffective.
Sunday, according to biblical teaching, was set asiJj
as a day of rest The Blue Laws attempting to enforce
the will of the bible, though this latter book has been
indicted by many great men for its alleged lack of com
petence or authority. In the old days a man or woman
could be whipped for writing a letter at his desk on
Sunday.
In a great industrial community, like The Warren
District and other great mining towns in the state of
Arizona, such a law would work a great hardship on the
majority. There is hardly a man, woman or child who
does not desire to rest on Sunday. We all welcome it.
We have been taught to believe in it That it is whole
some, aside from any significance attached to it from a
religious standpoint, is asserted.
Different people and different communities have differ
ent ways of taking their day of rest Some play and
some, actually, rest Catering to an exacting public,
some businesses remain open on Sunday. We can not
see any objection to this for should the strictest of laws
be passed against working on Sunday, at an office, in the
store, in the kitchen, in the garden or anyplace else, it
would not be enforced. So long as there is nothing
inimical in a man's occupation, even on a Sunday, the
great majority of us pity him for a necessity of having to
work. We are not prone to "put" the law upon hm.
We hope Phoenix is not reactionary in the sense that
it will permit its ordinances to be encumbered with un
enforceable legslation. There is reason to all things,
so let a little of it be exhibited by Arizona's biggest community.
STATE
HIGH
GRADE
Phoenix is in the midst of a cam
paign to pass a Sunday closing ordin
ance. Both of the canital city's news
papers have opened their columns to '
those who wish to air their views of
the subject The exact nature of the
ordinance is not kiftwn here but that
it is very stringent in its provisions.
James Macks, native of Ireland,
pioneer of this state, died Saturday
night as a result of injuries he sus
tained from a fall down the front
steps of the Pioneer's Home at Pres
cott He apparently has no relatives.
Macks came to Arizona in 1879, arriv
ing at Tombstone. He was born in
Ireland on June 15, 1847, and has lived
most of his life on this side of the
water, in Arizona. Superintendent!
Wren believes that at the time of his
(Jeath, Macks was demented. It had
been noticed that the old man bad not
been himself. He was on his way to
the hospital at the time he slipped
over the bannister and fell. This oc
curred about 6 o'clock Saturday even
ing, and death followed in about an
hour.
DRIVING ON SCHEDULE.
Just why people are continually "taking a chance" U
the subject of an editorial in the Arizona Republican,
under the heading; ' "At a Railway Crossing." Safety
First is a much abused term but its lesson is still ap
plicable. But read what the Republican has to say and"
when you drive your car up to a railroad or street car
crossing, remember that your vehicle can be stopped and
manipulated much easier than can the train or the trolley.
"On Monday afternoon of this week an automobile
disputed the right cf way with a Southern Pacific passen
ger train at Cochise station. The funerals of two or three
jf the occupants of the automobile have presumably taken
lace and another occupant is in a hospital The meet
ing occurred on a straightaway track at a point from
which the driver of the automobile could have seen the
ain for two or three miles. The engineer was running
n orders or on schedule, which required him to be it
ertaiu places at certain times. He could have reasonably
assumed that the movements of the driver of the auto
mobile were not so restricted by orders or previous ar
rangements. "What the driver thought is not known and will never
je known, but his conduct was that of a man under the
iiarassment of pressure for time. If so, he is much better
off now, for he is in eternity, where, weare informed,
there is no cause for hurry, where the principal feature
is unlimited leisure, and as some think, perfect content
ment. "The number of people who think they can beat a rail
road train across a track is amazing, though hardly more
amazing is the number of those who would not try such a
foolhardy race, but who approach dangerous crossings
without ascertaining, whether a train is coming. It is
well to give railway trains planty of leeway. That may
take a minute or two of the time of a driver, but he
should bear in mind the risk to which he is subjecting his
friends of the loss of time they would incur in attending
his funeral. Almost any kind of a funeral makes a big
hole in the working day.
"Even when the driver feels sure that be has plenty
of time he should let the train pass first That, as a
safety first measure, was impressed upon us the other
day by the predicament of an automobile driver in front
of a street car. As be attempted to cross the track the
street car was half a block away. There was apparently
plenty of time to cross, but the engine of the automobile
suddenly died with the nose of the machine between the
tracks. There was no accident for the street car was
easily stopped. If the car had been a railway train a
quarter of a mile away it could not have been stopped
and the automobile could not hav cbeen got under way
before the train would strike it.

perior court of Maricopa county in

Troops At Douglas Reviewed
By General Pershing; No More
Changes at Present Expected
DOUGLAS. Mar. 29. If a stranger
in town, particularly one who had
been reading the rumors of the possi
ble raiding of some border town by
Mexican bandits, had happened to be
j south of the United States infantry
camp about S:3u this morning, he
could hardly have been blamed for
thinking that all the troops stationed
in Douglas had been called to repel
some real or threatened attack. The
booming of guns would have aaiied
to this impression and the presence
pt the cavalry, infantry, artillery and
hospital corps would have made it ap
pear almost a certainty.
But such was not the case. It was
simply a review and inspection ot
the troops by Maj. Gen. J. J. Pershing
who arrived here last night from Na
co. This is the first time that Gen.
Pershing has been here since he was
made commander of the southern de
partment as successor of the late
, Gen. Frederick Funston.

Notwithstanding tne fact that prac
tically half of the infantry ha8 Deen
removed from Douglas, the gathering
this morning was a creditable show
ing of strength. With the bands play

ceived their diplomas from him, the
record of the heroes of the navy, par

urged sea fighters as shining marks

The graduates were told by the sec-

when upon your coolness and know-
hedge and leadership and ability to

the inspection, General Pershing,
with Gen. T. F. Davis, Col. Edwin t:

attention while the entire gathering
headed by the infantry, marched past.
General Pershing left Los Angeles
last week, visiting at Calexico, No
gales, Fort Huachuca and Naco before
arriving in Douglas.
Inspects the Guards
At Naco he inspected the Arizona
national guard and seemed to be very
lavorably impressed with the regi
ment, remarking . that they had im
proved wonderfully and compared lav
orably with any of the guard regi
ments who had seen service on the
border.
Vv ith the exception of the First cav
airy, which leaves for Monterey, Cal.,
upon the arrival of the Seventh cav
alry from El Paso, there will be no
more removal of troops from this dis
trict; neither have arrangements
been made for any additional troops,
according to Gen Pershing.
Gen. Pershing looks to be every
inch a soldier and thoroughly capaDle
of handling satisfactorily, any prob
lem that may arise during the present
crisis. He is accompanied by his -aide
Lieut. Collins and will leave Douglas
this evening about 7:30. After com
pleting all official business he was
the guest of Mayor Adamson this af

rooting. We, from a patriotic standi
point, can hardly realize why a nation
of one hundred million inhabitant
finds it so difficult to secure the small
number of men needed.
We notice that at the employment
offices the poolrooms, parks and oth
er gathering places of the Warren
District, are hundreds of single men,
out of employment, men without any
responsibility and no other care in the
world but their person. Some of them
have hardly a place to sleep, and dal
ly tramping over the trails looking
for work at the mines and other plac
es rather than to respond to the pat
riotic call of their country at this
critical time.
It is to be regretted that the indus
tries of the Warren District do not
follow the example in this regard that
those of England and other countries
-5opted at the beginning of the pres
ent war. That is: That any single
Tien looking for employment were
-lainly told by the employer that
"ieir duty was to their country. Fur
her, any young man found shirking
And refused to volunteer his services
'as sent a white feather by his own
-weetheart or lady friend. And this
VBtem worked wonderfully for the
'suits were that tliey all in shame at
"ing so ostracized by society, were
'-rced to enlist. Let us show our
""anadian cousins that we are equal
i the occasion: let us show the
--or!d at large that this great nation
'iimiled on the principle of Liberty
id Justice, will defpnd its rights and
nhold the banner of honor on every
'casion. Our flag has been tram
'd on, our people have been mur
'red in the coldest blooded manner,
ir sovereign rights have been invad
1, which is a sufficient cause to
-ousetihe red hot blood in any true
' merican veins.
In conclusion, the writer of this nr
icle wishes to state that he does not
ail for anyone to take his place, as
is going to offer his services to bis
untry whenever needed, immediate
' upon settlement of his private af
irs. Thankine you. my dear Mr. Editor,

M. Viviani, in proposing a toast to
.he health of President Wilson, said
le represented, not only himself but
is colleagues in the ministry. Al
uding to the possible entrance of the
Jnited States into the war, M. Vivia
ai spoke of tiie deep appreciation of
France for what Americans already
jad done for his country.;
"As sons of your fathers," contin
jed M. Viviani,. "I knew from the
ilrst that it would be impossible for
you to remain aloof from the strife
in which, we were not only defending
our soil but also were liberating the
world."
After a eulogy of Americans, their
spirits, their ideals, their' valor, and
their generous feeling toward the
world. M, Viviani said they were rom

"What is this victory!" exclaimed
M. Viviani, "it is th end of autocracy

This is not. to be a peace for one peo
ple, but, for all peoples; peace for the
weak against the predatory strong.
The children of our children must be
free from the shadow of oppression."

COLE TIGERS WILL
PLAY SOLDIERS AT
PARK NEXT SUNDAY
Local Bunch of Heavy Hitters
Will Meet Either Eleventh
or Eighteenth Infantry in
Their First Game.
With speedy baseball players drift
ing in every day and signing up with
the different mining companies' teams
in the district, W arren Park every
afternoon resembles a big league train
ing camp. The Tigers have practical
ly completed their, organization- and
will make their bow to local fans for
the first time this season next Sunday
afternoon, when they will cross bats
with either the Eleventh or Eighteenth
infantry teams from Camp Harry J.
Jones. Douglas. Little is known as
yet of the Eleventh infantry crowd,
but if the Tigers meet the Eighteenth
and make a good slewing they can
be counted to dish out good ball for
the entire season.
Manager Kline has lined up a bunch
of heady players, and claims to have
the heaviest hitters in the league.
One of the latest additions to the
Tigers' line-up is Annis, formerly with
the Coast and Northwestern leagues,
who will heave part of the time this
season. Annis played with Prescott
last year and, although the mile high
city nine came to a rather inglorious
end, Annis was given most of the
credit for .what good playing was
shown by the team. Evans, from the
Oakland Coast League nine, will di
vide mound honors with Annis. The
Oakland boy is a husky lad, with lots
of speed and a gc'jd head and he and
Annis are expected to do some pitch
ing that is pitching.
' Parode, fresh from Santa Barbara.
Calif., is slated to handle the catcher's
mitt for the Tigers. He is a thin and
very wiry chap, with a figure like a
baseball bat, but back home in Santa
Barbara he has the rep of being there
with the goods, and then some. Cap
tain Baugh will hold down the initial
sack; W. Cowan, a Cotton State
leaguer, will perch tin the second sta
tion: Ed Cowan, from "way down -in
Mobile, suh," is billed for shortstop
and Miller will look after third. Mil
ler is a recent acquisition from the
Wichita team. Irmin, Adams, Wilson,
llerney and Mills, all of whom have
played good baseball since they were
able to toddle atAut, will take turns
in the outfield.

WASHINGTON. March 29 Scarcity
Of labor ntlil hfph fnnrl nriftan
1916 a record year for strikes in the
United States. Statistics compiled In I
the department , of Iabt)r show there I
were 3,134 walkouts of all kinds dur- j
ing the year. Demands for higher
wages and for shorter hours caused
two thirds of the strikes. Most of the
others were due to differences con
cerning unionization of labor.
In more than 700 of the strikes the
strikers won, and employers were vic
torious in nearly S00. Others were
compromised.
We are paving the highest
prices for hides at present.
