House To Separate War And

In Anticipation Of Decree
WASHINGTON. June 25. A bill
for enforcement ot war time prohibi
tion will be reported out tomorrow by
the house judiciary committee.
Decision to separate the war time
from the constitutional prohibition
enforcement measure said to be the
most drastic liquor bill ever present
ed to congress was reached after an
all day session. A proposal that two
distinct bills be drafted was rejected
yesterday, but It was brought up
again today by Representative Walsh,
Republican of Massachusetts, and
was pending when a motion to ad
journ abruptly ended the discussion
There was no indication as how the
committee would have voted, but;
several ot the leading prohibition
members agreed tonight that in view
of the manifest differences between
the two issues and the possibility thaf

to do was to report out the war-time
bill the first thing tomorrow and the
constitutional bill later in the day.
In this way there is every assurance

would be ' passed probably by both
houses before the end of the month,

SENATORS BLOCK
IMMEDIATE PEACE
Foes of League of Nations
Tie Up Fall Proposal
In Committee
WASHINGTON. June 25. Failing
to command the united support ot
opponents of the - league of nations,
the proposal for an immediate 'de
claration of peace by congress was
blocked today in the senate foreign
relations committee.
After a long and lively discussion
the committee voted 12 to 4 to defer
action for the present on the resolu
tion of Senator Fall, Republican, of
New Mexico, embodying the peace
declaration. Five senators opposing
the league, including Chairman Lodge
joined the league advocates in sup
porting the postponement motion Be
sides Mr. Fall, those voting for im
mediate action were Senators Borah,
Idaho; Johnson, California; and
Moses, New Hampshire, all Republl
cans.
Later a special meeting to resume
consideration of the resolution was
called for Monday and Senator Fall
predicted a favorable report ot the
measure would result. Its opponents,
however, declared the discussion to
day revealed such opposition in the
committee that favorable action
would be impossible. After the com
mittee's decision, Mr. Fall announced
in the senate he would not ask for
action on his amendment to the army
bill, also embodying the peace declar
ation. The amendment thus failed
actually to come before the senate,
being technically disposed of prev
iously when a section to which it had
been attached went out of the bill on
a point of order.
Although the peace declaration pro
posal was not discussed in the sen
ate chamber during the day, Senator
Borah aroused a three hour debate on
other issues of the treaty fight hy
renewing his attack on the league cov
enant. Citing the army bill's provi
sion for an army of 400,000 men, the
Idaho senator declared the laegue
would increase rather than decrease
armament.

Daniels Announces Armada
Which Will Protect West
Coast To Start July 15-20
Will Stop At Los Angeles;
New Mexico Flagship; To
Comprise One Half Navy
WASHINGTON, June 25. The re
cently created Pacific fleet, now being
organized from vessels heretofore
forming a part of the Atlantic forces,
will sail from Hampton Roads for the
west coast between July 15 and 20,
Secretary Daniels announced today.
Mr. Daniels probably will be a passen
ger on one of the warships.
The Pacific fleet, upon reaching the
western coast will visit San Diego,
Los Angeles, San Francisco and prob
ably will make the last stop at Puget
Sound. Secretady Daniels, if able to
make the trip will visit the Pacific
coast naval yards and establishments
with a view to making recommenda
tions to congress next December for
necessary changes.
New Mexico to Be Flagship
The superdreaanaught New Mexico
will fly Admiral Hugh Rodman's flag
as flagship of the Pacific fleet, and the
Pennsylvania will remain the flagship
of the Atlantic fleet. The composition
of the two fleeets. Secretary Daniels
announced, will h.e made public within
a few days. -
In announcing the date ot departure
of. the Pacific fleet from Hampton
Roads, which is about a month earlier
than prevously contemplated. Secre
tary Daniels said he had planned on
visiting the Pacific coast in August,
and that he, therefore, would make .
every effort to go on with the fleet I
in order to study the scope of contem-;
plated improvements of naval facili
ties at the Panama canal. It was learn
ed at the navy department that exten
sive changes would be necessary in
the naval establishment in the canal
zone, especially on the Pacific side, to
take care of the greatly augmented
Pacific fleet.
Abandon Original Plan
When it was first decided to make
the Atlantic and Pacific ' fleets of
equal size and strentgh, the plan was
to send all of the oil burning ships
to the west coast and to keep the coal
burning-vessels in the Atlantic, due to
the geographical position of the na
tion's fuel resources. This plan has
been abandoned, it was announced to
day, because of the fact that such a
division would necessarily make the
two fleets very unequal in size and
gun power, almost all of the newest
and best ships being oil burners.

committed, but the British delegates
cannot bind Ireland.- The only signa
ture by which Ireland will be bound
are those of its own delegates, delib
erately chosen." . .

office of Reuter"s limited. The coun
cil had before it and examined fully,.
It is added, the facts relative to what
took place with regard to the ships
at the time the armistice was signed.
The following statement, the news
agency says, may be regarded as an
official explanation:
"At the time of the signing of the
armistice, the British admiralty and
the British government strongly urged
that the German ships should be sur
rendered. The French military auth
orities, however, put forward the view
that for the purpose of the armistice
the surrender of the German ships
was not absolutely essential. They
were most anxious that the nrmitice
should be concluded, having regard
for the very serious loss of life daily
on the western front. Insistence unon
surrender of the fleet, they felt, might
delay the signing for which, despite
rumors to the contrary, Marshal Foch
was as desirous as anyone.
"The French, therefore. sii-Tosied
that the German ships be Interm-d in
neutral ports. This view was sup
ported by Admiral Benson, (American
naval representative in Paris).
"Ultimately, a compromise waa
reached providing for the Internment

PHOENIX, June 25 The city com
mission today were asked to grant
a permit for a fistic "battle royal" in
Phoenix, June 2S. Members of the

for all boxing bouts here on the or
ganization, other permits should not
be granted.
RIOTING IN BERLIN
ON EVE OF SIGNING
(Continued from Page One) .
Saturday and possibly not until Mon
day. The council of four was informed
that during Wednesday the German
government was busily engaged in try
ing to arrange the personnel of its del
egation in Versailles.
The Germans thus far have given
no intimation as to what men are to
be the choice of the Bauer govern
ment. Unofficial advices indicate that
the cabinet is experiencing great dif
ficulty in finding men who are willing
to take upon their shoulders the duty
of acknowledging, in a document
which will become world history, Ger
many's utter defeat in the war and her
unqualified acquiescence to the terms
of the visitors.
Huns All "Pass Buck"
Reports are that Herman Mueller,
foreign secretary in the Bauer cabinet,
like Dr. Hainsel von Haimbausen, de
clined to accept the onus of signing a
treaty admittedly obnoxious to the
Germans.
Even a visit Wednesday to Ver
sailles, where the members of the
original German delegation still are,
by the general secretary of the peace
conference, failed to bring forth any
knowledge of what was being done in
Germany toward the selection of plen
ipotentiaries. Paris dispatches assert that owing
to the uncertainty of the situation,
the heads of the Rallied and associated
powers are contemplating issue of an
ultimatum setting a day and a time
satisfactory to them for the appear
ance of the Germans before the peace
congress to sign the treaty.
HOUSE HINTS WILSON
MAY LIFT BEER BAN
Continued from Paee onei
actively into the fight with a vigorous
demand for separation of the meas-1
ures, notwithstanding the previous
action of the committee. Mr. Walsh
"declared the committee .ought -to take
the bull by the hors. get the war- i
time enforcement bill introduced be
fore the house and urge" quick enact
ment.
Then if the president wanted to lift
the ban it would only be necessary,
he said, to suspend the act providing
for war-time enforcement and not in-1
terfere with legislation affecting con-:
stitutioal prohibition. !
The committee, Mr. Walsh added, i
then could go ahead and make ready
machinery for permanent prohibition.
Unless the bills were separated there
would be no possibility of enacting
any law before July 1, Mr. Walsh
stated, adding that he would go before
the rules committee and get a rule
by which the measure could be pass
ed promptly and without extended de
bate. Several members cf'the com
mittee, including Chairman Volstead,
took part in the discussion that fol
lowed. ' A vote was within sight, but
the house gong, calling members to a
roll call, suddenly ended the meet
ing. There has been no straight prohi
bition and anti-prohibition alignment
j in ihe voting heretofore on the v'ar
j ious amendments. Some of the ardent
j prohibitionists have supported
amendments eliminating drastic fea
tures, anq they have agreed that it is
necessary to separate the measures
in order to get action before the coun
try goes "dry" next week.

Fruits of Bolshevism
A decree of Lenine and his associates, dated Dec. IS, 1917 provides
a Revolutionary Tribunal to take care of the Russian press. The first
three paragraphs of this degree are as follows:
1. Under the Revolutionary Tribunal is created a Revolution
ary Tribunal of the Press. Thi3 tribunal will have jurisdiction of
crimes and offenses against the people committed by means of the
press.
2. Crimes and offenses by means of the press are the publica
tion and circulation of any false or perverted reports and informa
tion about events of rublic life, insofar as they constitute- an at
tempt upon the rights and interests of the revolutionary people.
3. The Revolutionary Tribunal of the Press consists of three,
members, elected for a period of not longer than three months by
the Soviet workmen's, soldiers' and peasants' deputies. These mem
bers are charged with the conduct of the preliminary investigation
as well as the trial of the case.
There is no jury trial of charges brought under this decree, and the
decisions of the Revolutionary Tribunal are final and not subject to
appeal.
In July 5, 1918, issue of Pravda, the Bolshevist organ of Lenine
(so admitted by Max Eastman), the policy of the Bolshevist leaders is
stated as follows:
The press is the most dangerous weapon in the hands of our
enemies. We will tear it Jrom them, we will reduce it to impotence.
It is the moment for us to prepare for battle. We will be inflex
ible in our defence of the rights of the people. We are going to
smite the journals with fines, to shut them up, to arrest the editors
'hold them as hostages.
The suppression of li e? paper Mir give further light on the at
titude of the Bolshevists toward the press. The Bolshevist organ, Izves
tia, of Oct. 17, 1918, published the following announcement:
In accordance with the decision published in the Izvestia on the
27th of July, No. 159, I he Tress Department granted permits to is
sue to periodical publication wiiich accepted the Soviet platform.
When granting permission the Press Department took into consid
eration the available supplies of paper, whether the population was
in need of the proposed periodical publication, and also the neces
sity of providing employment for printer and pressman. Thus
permission was granted to issue the paper Mir, especially in view
of the publisher's declaration that the paper was intended to prop
agate pacifibt ideas. At the present moment the requirements of '
thcpopulation of the Federal Socialist Republic for means of daily
information are adequately met by the societ publications; employ
ment for those engaged in journalistic work is secured in the soviet
papers; a paper crisis is approaching. The Press Department there
fore, considers it impossible to permit the further publication of
the Mir and has decided to suppress this paper forever.
As "freedom of speech" means freedom to praise the Bolshevist
leaders, so "freedom of the priss" means freedom to issue "periodical
publications which accept the Soviet platform.
"If He Can,
Why does Indiana produce so many writers?
This question ia often asked.
There are two reasons.
First, Indiana for many years after its first settlement, was inac
cessible to the larger centers of population.
In the small isolate communities of early time people preserved
their individuality.
Ia cities people are relatively alike the become alike by associa
tion in large numbers, they have the same amusements and diversions
they "hire" their amusements the same as haying their clothes made or
employing the performances of other common services.
Ia a country community people are forced on their own resources
for amusements and diversions; they become adepts at story telling,
practical joking, unique expression and humorous simile.
Then there is the general influence of pioneer life.
The open sky, the hills, tie trees, the sounds of the wind through
the forest; the cry of the owls by night life amid virgin nature stim
lated the imagination and vision.
Before the open fire-places of early times, and from its glow and
warmt hcamehuman fancies in story and song.
While but few of these original fancies may have been recorded for
posterity, yet their spirit, the ability, to create them, does not die out
In one, two or three generations; it is an inborn spark that can be
fanned to flame at will, and even In now congested populations and lush
civilization with all their lettered traditions.
Here is the second reason why Indiana produces so many writers:
It has been the assertion of the human will.
It is that spirit which says: "If he can, why I can!"
For Instance, years ago some small town lawyer of Indiana may
have written a successful book.
Others ia his and neighboring towns said to themselves: "If he can,
why lt can."
In this spirit many attempts were made.
Many of them have failed; most of their manuscripts may not even
hare seen the light of type.
' ' But on the law of averages, out of the many failures, a few suc
ceeded and these in turn, through the course of years, inspired others
with the same spirit: "If he can, why 1 can."
This last may be the main reason why Indiana produces so many
writers, and aside from that of location and a pioneer background.
It is like the automobile industry being centered about Detroit and
Cleveland, at least ia its earlier development.
It should have logically been located in New England where they
had for many years the mechanics and machine thop fat... '
But Henry Ford and Alexander Winton, two pioneers ol uie automo
bile, happen to live in Detroit and Cleveland respectively; their neigh
bors said: "If ho can, why I can!" and a vast general industry came
into being la particular locations. ,
It la a matter of mind, will, rather than location it is a question
of where tho mea with the mind and will are located, and no difference
whether It la writing a book, building a bridge, flying in the air or w in
ning a ball game.

OF EXPOSURE ON DESERT
YUMA. June 25 Lying in ;a shallow
grave behind a saloon at Andrade.
Mexico, lies the body of Craighton
Shelby, a well known young man of
this city. He was buried there Sun
day by Mexicans after he had died
at that place from desert exposure
and thirst.
Friday afternoon Craighton Shelby,
the 34 year-old son of Dr. J. P. Shel

tinue the trip to the border and to
Andrade.
Before leaving Yuma. Mr. Shelby
cashed a large check which he had
received from the U. S. R. S. for
whom he had been working for some
time past. The family did not be
come uneasy of tne non-appearance
of the young man until Saturday when
a search was instigated. A search
ing party headed by Bert Marsh,
brother-in-law of the dead boy. and
including Sheriff Greenleaf and Roy
White, crossed the California line at
Yuma and started to scour the desert
west and south of Winterhaven. The
horse and cart with which young
Shelby left Yuma was found in the
"jungles" southwest of Yuma, the cart
overturned and the horse loose upon
the desert. Sunday it was learned
at Andrade that an American boy had
come into that town, suffering from
exposure on the desert, died, and had
been buried behind a small saloon at
that place.
Craighton Shelby was a graduate in
inedieiae at Craighton university.
Omaha, Neb. He was a member of
be cla of '06, and since his gradua
tion had been a resident of Yuma. At

ard T. O'Donnell. J. L. Await. C. C.

This case was tried in the local
court before Judge Pattee in March.

was in favor of Dutton. The case at
the time attracted quite a bit of no
tice in mining circles, by reason of

which at that time had never been
passed upon by the state appellate
court
The ground in controversy, known

not there could be anything infectious
about the strange affliction. The cat

LEAGUE REFERENDUM
CERTAIN NEXT FALL
SAYS SENATOR fiORAH
WASHINGTON, DW. C, June 2S
A nation-wide referendum on the
League of Nation is almost certain to
be held next fall.
Senator William E. Borah of Idaho,
chief senate champion of the right of
the American people to express ttyeir
opinions on this vital question, so de
clared today . after . completing a
thorough canvass of the senate on the
subject.
"I have canvassed the senate pretty
thoroughly," said Senator Borah, 'and
I find that its sentiment Is over
whelmingly in favor of a vote of the
peole on whether they wish this coun
try to join the League of Nations.
"Some Republican conservatives are
opposed to it, as they are always op
posed to a referendum on anything.
But there are enough Democrats
men who favor the league anxious
for a vote on the question to more
than offset those opposed to it.
"Only one thing now stands in the
way of a referendum. That is the
fact thafthe League of Nationr cov
enant is tied up with the peace treaty.
Until the two are separated we can
not hold a referendum.
"Therefore, the question of a ref
erendum hinges on the passage of the
Knox resolution, which would sepa
rate the league covenant from the
treaty itself. When. this has been
passed' by the senate, we can go
ahead aad ratify the treaty, and take
our time to consider the League of
Nations.
"IF THE KNQX RESOLUTION IS
DEFEATED, THERE CAN BE NO
REFERENDUM."
Senator Borah feels certain.howev
er, that the Knox resolution would
pass the senate by at least one vote.
Whichever way it goes, the majority
will not be more than one or two
vptes.
As soon as the Knox resolution
passes Senator Borah will introduce
a resolution calling tor a referendum
vote, setting the date and appropriat
ing the money to. pay for it.
Borah said it would not be possi
ble for the senate to vote on a ref
erendutn at the same time it votes
on the Knox resolution.
"There 'are a good many Demo
crats," he explained, "who feel they
must stand by the administration and
vote against the Knox resolution, al
though they favor a referendum. If
the latter were voted on now, there
fore, it would be defeated; while if
the division of the league from the
treaty is made first, there is no ques
tion of its passage.

FLU EPIDEMIC KILLED
SIX MILLION IN INDIA
CALCUTTA. June 28.- Six million
deaths from flu occurred In India last
year, according to a report just issued

sease in all countries of the world
and is equivalent to half the mortal

years it has ravaged. A curious fact
Is that the flu deaths reached a high

STOCKS AND BONDS
NEW YORK, June 25. Operations
on the stock exchange reflected in a
more pronounced manner the extraor
dinary changes which have come over
the speculative situation with the ap
proaching ratification of the peace
treaty.
This was manifested not so much by
the market's frequent periods of ex
treme listlessness as by the narrow
and perfunctory character of the trad
ing. The turnover was the smallest of
the trading. The turnover was the
smallest of any full session in many
weeks, failing to attain the familiar
million share mark.
Aside from, the money market,
which was the governing influence,
there was little in the days develop
ments of direct interest or relation to
quoted values. Call money opened at
1xh per cent rose to 15 per cent in the
final hour and closed at 8.
Stocks had an irregular to heavy
opening, but recovered before midday
on the strength and activity of metals,
those issues showing extreme gains
of 1 to almost 5 points on reports of
copper sales at 18 cents.
Motors, oils .shippings, tobaccos,
leathers and several of the food Issues
recorded gains of 1 to 3 points, but
these were largely dissipated when the
money flurry occurred. Some popular
stocks, especially shippings, proved
superior to this condition an dserved I
to sustain the general list when money
rates relaxed.
Investment rails displayed little of
yesterday's resilent tone, the few note
worthy gains being limited to minor or
secondary issues. Paper, chemical and
affiliated issues were mainly higher.
the market showing an irregular mix
ture of losses and gains at the end,
Sales amounted to 935,000 shares. To
tal sales, par value, aggregated $7,-
225.000. Old United States bonds were
unchanged on call.
The bond market followed the un
certain course of stocks, trading in
that department also dwindling per
ceptibly.

THE GRAIN MARKETS
CHICAGO, June 25. The corn mar
ket today ran an uneven course, early
weakness evidenced by many selling
orders being overcome later, convert
ing an- initial, break into a bulge. The
market closed firm, lc to 2c net
higher, with July Sl.80 to $1.81.
September $1.76 to $1.767i and De
cember $154 to $154. Oats gained
c to lc and provisions closed 15c
lower to $1 higher.
Peace news apparently was already
sufficiently discounted and favorable
crop conditions noted in different lo
calities were held to have had little
influence on the market, greater stress
being laid on a strengthened cash de
mand.
Oats were relatively stronger with
corn and recuperated from an early
sag more rapidly though within nar
row bounds.
Provisions worked away from some
what low levels influenced by steady
live nog prices. Offerings were ab
sorbed freely when corn rallied.

SAYS HOME FOR
FEEBLE-MINDED
IS ARIZONA NEED
Editor Review:
During the first influenza epidemic
a mother lay very sick in' one of our
Arizona towns. She was talking with
a kind neighbor who had cared foi
her. She said: "You know I have no
relatives and I dread to think of what
will become of my child if I am taken
away. As long as 1 live. I can care
for her. Oh, if there was only some
state home in Arizona to look, after
such unfortunate people!" Fortunate
ly the mother lived, but the neighboi
well knew the conditions. She lived
in a neat little house with a large
back yard, surrounded ly a high
board fence, the gate' being always
locked. There was a large tree to
give shade, and flowers in one corn
er. And always, all day long, in this
yard, was a girl of about twelve who
was feebleminded. Think of the dark
dread in this mother's heart when
she feared she would not survive the
attack of influenza.
There are many boys, girls, men,
women in Arizona who are epileptic,
feebleminded, "lacking" and other
degrees of unfortunate mental con
dition, and in this whole progressive
state there is no place to send them
Of course, now that people are awak,
ening to' the fact, suggestions are
made as to how to handle the matter.
One is this: That suitable buildings
be erected at a distance from the
others, on the 3400 acre farm at Fort
Grant State Industrial School, the
feebleminded and other Buch to be
placed there. Whatever arrangement
is made, we must remember that it
requires special training to handle
such people and that it will be neces
sary to send away and get a qualified
person to act as the head of the new
home, under the superintendent, who
should also be trained ' for the work
which he is placed in charge of. New
buildings are being erected at Fort
Grant school, but we shall hardly Ob
tain much better results among the
boys and girls sent there, than we
have in the past, unless the man in
charge knows something of his bust
ness, and remains longer than the
average has done, which we believe.
the schpol must be taken out of poll-
is eighteen months
In other words,
tics and then maybe we should have
a place to be proud of. Contributed.

DOUGLAS
OFFICERS
NAMED
FOR OIL COMPANY
The move to ascertain whether or
not oil may be found near Bisbee and
Douglas is under way.
The big important rteps looking tq
the putting down of a test well in the
Bowie oil fields by Biabee-Douglas
business men was taken last night at
the Commercial club rooms by the
election of the following officers and
directors of the newly organized
States Oil and Refining company:
President, Frank C. Bledsoe.
Vice President, J. O. Tonkin.
Secretary, J. L. Powell.
Treasurer, Sam Frankenburg.
Directors, J. E. Brophy, B. H.
Washburn, E. P Brewster, of Bisbee,
and R. G. Arthur of Douglas.
L. A. Holmes, who a3 geologist, ac
companied some of the directors to the
field Saturday and Sunday, made a
very favorable report on the field.
Mr. Holmes' report is in part as fol
lows: - .
"The only proof of whether oil is
to be found or not in this locality is
by actual drilling. Drilling has been
started on this property again with a
Standard rig, and the pre.sant depth of
the hole is approximately 300 feet.
THE LOCATION IS AS GOOD AS
COULD BE SELECTED, AND THE
POSSIBILITIES ARE VERY FAVOR
ABLE FOR THE FINDING OF OIL.
The probable depth of the oil sand in
this locality is approximately the same
as that of the Burkburnett field in
north central Texas."
The soliciting committee, consisting
of L. R. Allen, J. U Powell and L. R.
Caulfield was authorized and th'ey
will call on the business community
generally regarding taking subscrip
tions for stock, and the directors and
those present pledged themselves en
thusiastically to get busy in Bisbee
and Douglas to raise $42,500 for put
ting the well down in order to deter
mine the existence of the golden fluid
in our own home neighborhood. v
