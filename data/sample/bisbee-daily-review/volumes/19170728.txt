Oil TARNOPOL
Retirement in Eastern Galicia
Continues But Russians Are
Showing Signs of Fight in
Other Theaters.
(By Review Leased Wire)
COPENHAGEN, July 27.
Reports from Vienna say
the evening newspapers in
the Austrian capital assert that
the Russians are evacuating
Czernowitz, capital of Buko
wina. The Russian retirement in
Eastern Galicia continues.
There has been a noticeable
slackening in the Austro-Ger-man
advance north of the
Dniester, where the Russians
now are offering more spirit
ed resistance but south of the
river to the Carpathians the
Teutonic forces are moving
forward almost unimpeded.
Around Tarnopol the Austio-Gerf
mans have met with stubborn resist
ance from the Russians, but Prince
Leopold's soldiers were able to en
large recent gains on the eastern ban
of the Sereth. Between Trembowla
and Skoromocze, south of Tarn'opol,
the Russians were forced to yield the
crossings of the Sereth and Gniza riv
ers on a front of about eight miles, ac
cording to Berlin. Southeast of Tar
tropol, Petrograd reports the Austro
German attacks were repulsed.
Russians Retire
The Russians have retired to new
positions southeast of Trembowla, but
4 whether they also surrendered the
""crossings of the Sereth there, Petro
grad does not say. Btweeen Czortkov
and thet Dniester, Russian cavalry
has repelled Teutonic assaults and
driven the attackers northwetstward
toward M'onasterzyska.
South of the Dniester Into the foot
hills of the Carpathians the Russians
are retiring eastward. Kolomea,
about 50 miles northwest of Cztrno
vitz, capital of Bukowina, has been
occupied by Bavarian and Austro-Hun-garian
ti'oops. The town is an im
portant railway junction. An unoffi
cial report from Austrian sources says
the Russians are evacuating Czerno
vitz. The advance of the Rumanians in
the Suchitza valley northwest of Foc
sani has resulted in the abandonment
of that valley as far as the upper
course of the Putna by the Austro
Germans. The Rumanians have mo
ed their line forward seven and one
half miles, gaining all their objectives
and occupying 10 villages.
More than 40 Oadditional prisoners
and guns and war material were cap
tured by the Rumanians.

No World's Series
For This Year
(By Review Leased Wire.)
CHICAGO, July 27. There Is
likely to be no world's series this
ydar as a esult of the drain on
major league baseball players by
the draft. B. B. Johnson, president
of the American league, said here
tonight. Tabulation of draft num
bers held by players shows that
probably 25 men will be taken
from the American league. The
American league will not play the
series if it Is handicapped by so
serious a loss, Mr. Johnson saia.
The league president also stated
that he had learned that the mili

WASHINGTON, July 27. A deluge

pleas from Industrial concerns for ex

drew from the provbst marshal's office
today a statement that Questions must
be addressed to local boards and that
claims for Industrial exemption must
go later to the district boards.

TRAINMEN WILL
CALL STRIKE IN
CHICAGO TODAY
Nineteen Windy City Rail
roads Affected by Demands
of Yardmen General
Walkout Expected This
Morning.
( By Review Leased Wire.)
CHICAGO. July 27. The 19 Chicago
railroads which have been threat
ened with a strike tomorrow
morning of 2500 switchmen be
longing to the Brotherhood of Railroad
Trainmen tonight began sending out
notices of an embargo on livestock
and perishable freight t'o and through
Chicago. This announcement was
made by Frank Hasler of the commit
tee of railroad general managers.
Mr. Hasler said the embargo would
be for the duration of the strike and
would automatically end with an
agreement.
The railroads also appealed to May
or Thompson, SheriiT Traeger and
Chief of Police Schuettler for protec
tion and arranged with police officials
to discuss means of protecting the rail
road's property.
Railroads' Statement
George F. Hanover, chairman of the
reads' conference committee, sent the
following notices to the city officials:
"The conference committee of man
agers of the roads are threacenec dj
the Brotherhood of Railroad Trainmen
with a strike of the yardmen employ
ed in their Chicago terminals if they
do not make concessions which would
establish the closed shop in favor of
members of their organization and de
prive the management of the power to
select yardmasters and their assist
ants. "The railroads are also tirea:eneu
with a strike 'of the members of the
switchmen's union employed in
their Chicago terminals if they
do yield to the demands of the
Brotherhood of Railroad Trainmen, be
cause this would close the door of em
ployment against many members of
the switchmen's union.
"The conference committee has pro
posed mediation by the federal mdia
tion and conciliation board, which has
been declined by the Brotherhood of
Railroad Trainmen.
Charge Are Denied
"A strike vote has been taken and
Mr. Murdock, vice president or tne
railway trainmen, has notified us that
the members of his organization In the
Chicago district will be withdrawn
from service at 6 a. m. Saturday,
June 28.
"'This means there will be a great
industrial tie-up to traffic in the Chi
cago switching district and the rail
roads will need protection to enable
them to conduct their business."
James Murdock, vice president or
the bibtherhood, denied that the
switchmen were seeking a closed shop
and criticized the reasons given out
by the railroad managers as causing
the Btrlke as "unqualifiedly incorrect."
He said 98 per cent of the switchmen
had voted in favor of a strike because
the railroads had refused to grant re
quests made by the brotherhood.
The new rules sought would give
preference to members of the brother
hood in employing yardmen, give pref
erence to yardmen in promotions to
yardmasters and prohibit the com
panies from reinstating men justly
discharged, In disregard of the rights
of other loyal yardmen, according to
Mr. MurdDck.

TO CLOSE DOWN
Iron Silver Mining Company and Empire Zinc Among Prop

Underground Tools and Equipment Ordered Yesterday
Decision of Investigators Will Not Affect Operators,
Disgusted With Labor Situation at Leadville.
(By Review Leased Wire.)
LEADVILLE, Colo., July 27. Three of the leading mining
companies in the Leadville district announced their inten
tion tonight of closing down five of the largest mines in
this field pending a readustment of the labor situation. Pumps
are being withdrawn, underground tramways, tram cars and
tools removed, and preparations made for an indefinite shut
down, the managers said, until such a time as the operators
claim they can operate without the interference of the labor
unions.
Two of the three companies making this announcement
were the Iron Silver Mining company and the Empire Zinc
company. The third, which is one of the biggest producing
companies in this field, declined to permit its names to be used
in connection with the shutdown, but announced it would not
resume operations regardless of what decision the investiga
tors arrived at after their investigations here.
Famous Old Moyer Mine Abandoned
Other Leadville companies have an-
nounced their intention of awaiting I
the findings of the investigation board i
appointed by Governor Gunter before
reaching a decision as to whether or
not properties would be operated.
The Empire Zinc company's mines
here are known as the Small Hopes
mining group and include the Emmett,
the McCormicb and the Colonel Sel
lers, although the latter mine has been
closed for some time. The Emmett
and McCormick will be closed for the
present at least, pending a perma
nent settlement of the labor troubles
which have developed in this camp,
according to: the representatives of
the Empire company. This company
recently expended several hundred
thousand dollars on these properties
and had planned to expend additional
large sums. All employes were paid off
today and the company ordered the re
moval of all underground tools and
equipment in preparation for an In
definite shut down. These mines are
wet but are unwatered by the pumps
of neighboring properties.
The Iron Silver company announc
ed its intentions of closing down all
operations at the old Moyer mine.

Mine Slowly Flooding.
The pumps were withdrawn from
this historic property last Friday, the
pumps having been shut down at that
time for the first time In more than
19 years. The tools were withdrawn
and the management of this company
announced tonight that, in the event
that the labor problem was not

The Moyer has been one of the his

lion tons of heavy sulyhide ore during
the past twenty years is said by local
mining authorities to be a record for
the state. The mine is now filling up
slowly from the underground water
courses and it is considered highly
probable here that it may never be
worked for ore again. At one time
the Moyer gave employment to mors
than 500 miners and has produced as

H. S. Lee, manager of the Leadville

port. Continued application of the vag
rancy laws in the Warren District is
poing far toward the elimination of
the agitator and the non-working
man. City Police court was crowded
yesterday from morning until niRht
- and the justice court in Lowell was
nearly as active with, similar com
plaints. Few men who are anxious to avoid
working and who desire to remain in
the city or District are escaping the
notice of the officers. The guards at
the various ports of entry to the com
munity are watching with vigilance
and few are getting by without close
examination.
Working forces of the several op
erators in the Warren District are be
ing increased daily. One of the best
features of the increase is the fact
that it is not being done in hit and
miss fashion. The utmost care is be
ing exterted by the rustling commit
tee to only recommend men who are,
in the first place, Americans and who
in every other respect are likely to
make good citizens for Bisbee.
Rumors continue to flood Bisbee re
garding the activities of "wobblirs"
and one man was so kind several days
ago as to write Sheriff Wheeler that
600 of the Columbus aggregation
would come to Tombstone, by way of
Bisbee. Another rumor had W. B.
Cleary starting for Washington, via
Chicago, where he was to have con
ferred with Bill Haywood. Though
cleary would undoubtedly confer with
Haywood, previous to visiting Presi
dent Wilson, the story was absolutely
discredited by private advices from
the New Mexico town.
That the Columbus "wobbly" camp
is slowly breaking up is the word
brought by people who have visited
the New Mexico town. Cleary is en
deavoring to hold the men together
but internal dissention seems immi
nent and the threatening, coercive at
titude of the men appears to be near

Peaceful is the Warren District
without any possibility of trouble aris

RIGHT NOW IS THE
TIME OF GREATEST
PERIUN DISTRICT
(Continued From Page One)
-
subterfuge, hypochicy, whining
complaints, silly complaints, mon
strous lies, are now being used to
try to gain sympathy from an out
raged public.
"Nearer he tottered, and nearer.
Paws crossed like hands that
pray
From brow to jaw his steel shod
paw.
It ripped my face away."
Threatening Letters.
Other methods will follow. The
Arizona Federation of Labor is be
ing suborned and seduced through
at least one or two of its state
leaders to aid the I. W. W. prop
aganda of revenge. There can be
no doubt but that certain wobblies
have run the gauntlet of guards
around the district. J. U Donel
ly, the labor leader and wobbly
sympathizer, slipped in here and
out again with his lips twisted and
writhing with lies and abmonia
tions. The Review receives threat
ening and abscene letters in every
mail signed "Wobbly", and mail
ed right here in Bisbee. Reports
from towns aound here indicate
that not a few of the Columbus
stockade bummers are hovering
on the outskirts of the district
awaiting their chance.
These mep who were driven
away do not lack cunning or
nerve. They will not relinquish
the richest morsol in all the min
ing district of the west without a
supreme effort. The trsmp is still,
after the silverware. Don't tie up
the watch dog.
Cleaning-tip Goes On.
The work, of cleaning out the
district, we are proud and gird to
say, still goes on. It should never
be slackened for a day. Miners
and business men. with a devotion
that cannot be praised too highly,
are devoting all their energies and
efforts to this work. It is grind
ing toil, this constant vigilance
and interrogation and watchful
ness Rnd investigation. Force of
character and firmness and good
judgment and devotion to duty are
required to keep the bars in place,
the broom lusy and the valley
clean.
Every citizen must do his part.
Keep a look out for the vag and
the loafer and the agitator. When
you see one or hear one, spot him
and tell the authorities. It is im
perative that you do this if you
of the
mac, do.

Relaxation Dangerous.
Never, since the first prospector
drove a burrow over the divide
from Tombstone, has the future
looked so bright and fair for the
Warren District as it does right
now. The storm has cleared the
air, the fever of unrest has been
stilled, the voice of the rabble
rouser has given way to the
sounds of industry and the val
ley sparkles like a diamond in its
setting of mountains.
But any relaxation right now
would be fatal. We have drained
the valley and erected dykes. The
cost was too great to allw a leak
and a seepage that would soon
have this scum pouring through.
The Big Drive succeeded beyond
our greatest expectations. All we
have to do now it to sit tight and
watch close and keep our muscles
taut and our resolve unshaken and
our sense of danger always on the
alert. If we do this the supreme
effort of July 12 will not have been
in vain. If we nod and slumber
fcnd allow ourselves to be lulled
to a false security, then we will
have to begin all over again. Only
the formaldehyde of constant
watchfulness will keep vermin
away.
Deputies Faithful.
And before bringing this warn
ing to a close, the editor of the
, Review wishes to pay a just tri
bute to the deputies who are
guarding this district from its en
emies. Riding in a car the other
n?gl:t, we pnssed over the divide.
It was a wild night. Black clouds
brushed the peaks; the wind sang
a sad song in the canyons; a ter
rible storm was fast approaching
from the east. By the side of the
road was a shed of a tent and un
der it two cots and a little bed
ding and a chair or two.
A lightning flash cut the sky
like a sword. In its blinding light
stood two deputies in either side
of the road. One of them raised
his hand with an imperative
gesture. "Halt!" he called. The
car came to a stop. The deputies
scrutinized its occupants and
questioned them. "Pass on," said
the leader. Each man carried a
rifle in the hoilow of his arm.
Their faces were as set as the
hills. They were absolutely in
different to storm danger or dark
ness. They were on duty; that
was all.
Do Your Part!
On every road leading into thjs
district are men like these, stand
guard day and night through ail
kinds of weather.

And Is Now Well.
Hlxson, Tenn. " About 10 years ago
I was..." ears Sirs. J. B. Cadd, of
this place. "I suffered with a pain In
my left side, could not sleep at night
with this pain, always in the left
side...
Illy doctor told me to use Cardui. I
took one bottle, which helped me and
after my baby came, I was stronger
and better, but the pain was still
there.
I at first let it go, but began to get
weak and in a run-down condition,
so I decided to try some more Cardui,
which I did.
This last Cardui which I took mads
me much better, in fact, cured me. It
has been a number of years, still I
have r.o return of this trouble.
I feel it was Cardui that cured me,
and I recommend it as a splendid fe
male tonic."
Don't allow yourself to become
weak and run-down, from womanly
troubles. Take Cardui. It should sure
ly help you, as it has so many thou
sands of other women in the past 40
years. Headache, backache, stdeache,
nervousness, sleeplessness, tired-out
feeling, are all signs of womanly trou

Cardui. Why sot you? All druggists.

8Y REVIEW
(By Review- Leased Wire)
NEW YORK, July 27. Coverins of
shorts In steels and war shares gener
ally contrubted as muqh as anything
to the comparative strength of today's
dull stock market operations. The
movement In most essentials was the
replica of recent week ends, when the
bear faction seemed to find It expe
dient to settle outstanding commit
ments. Metals figured among the
rains of 1 to 3 points. The market
was at Its besf in the last hour, that
being the broadest trading period of
the session. United States Steel led
to the rise In active stocks to 122,
closing at a net gain of 14 points.
Total sales 337.000 shares.
Heaviness of International issues
was the noteworthy feature of the,
bond market and domestic rails and
industrials also yielded. Liberty ZWs
changed bands in large blocks at 99.39
to 99.44 for regular lots to 99.35 for
odd lots. Total sales of bonds, (par
value), aggregated $2,945,000.
United States bonds, (old issues).
were unchanged on call.
DUN'S REVIEW STATEMENT.
NEW.IORK. July 27. Dun's Re-
vieWJomorrow will say:
The slowing down of business, cus
tomary with the approach of mid-summer,
is accentuated by the uncertain
ties engendered by international con
ditions and less strength appears in
prices. Reaction from the extreme
levels has occurred, not only in sea
sonable foodstuffs but also in oiher
commodities in which there has been
seemed no advance to advance, such
as in pig iron and belief that the crest
of some of the leading markets has at
last been passed is spreading.
CHICAGO GRAINS.
CHICAGO, July 27. Crop impair
ment in the southwest, a result of too
much dry weather, led to a higher av
erage of prices today for corn. The
market closed steady M off to 1 cent
up, with September 1.63 and December
116. Wheat gained 3 to 5 and oats
to I1! A net decline of 5 to 17
was shown in provisions.
An official monthly crop report from
Kansas tended to emphasize bullish
corn, sentiment, as the report suggest
ed a material decrease in the spring
wheat crop. Assertions that distillers
would be likely to operate until at
least September 1 counted likewise in
favor of the bulls. Likelihood of a
serious railroad strike here was not
generally known until after trading
had about ended for the day.
Predictions of a reduced yield of
wheat in Minnesota and South Dakota
did a -good - deal to strengthen - the
wheat market. Reports were current
also ht nothwithstanding ideal har
vest conditions, the movement of the
winter crop was slow.
Oats advanced mainly on account of
free buying supposed to be for eastern
interests. Harvest and threshing re
ports .were favorable.
Weakness in provisions was due
more to a lack of support than to any
important pressure.
COMMERCIAL BULLETIN.
BOSTON, July 27. The Commercial
Bulletin will say tomorrow:
The improvement in the tone of the
wool market which became apparent a
week ago has continued into the pres
ent week with a continuance of fair
buying of new territory wools in the
originals bags at fully firm-prices.
There has also been some demand for
fine and half blood foreign wools. Buy
ing in the west has become rather lim
ited although recent purchases are at
full prices.

NEW YORK, July 27. Except for a
momentary period of depression early
due to the efforts of the local,-professional
element the tone of the market
was a strong one and as the session
progressed, gathered in strength. As
in the past early selling by profes
sinal element did not induce any out
side liquidation of consequence, and
the contraction In offerings is aug
menting the belief that the market is
in a rather sold out condition, and the
technical position consequently one of
firmness. The news of the day other
than that suggesting a turn for the
better in the Russian situation which
carried little or no significance and
the improvement in price therefore, is
ascribed to the technical reason. A
helpful factor was a further advance
Jn the price of copper metal and the
reports of large orders being placed
with the equipment companies, pro
mote more vigorous demand for the
shares of companies coming under this
category.
The apparent firm technical founds. !
tion will no doubt aid the market
doubly sensitive to occurrences of
constructive interpretation.

War
THE magnitude of the great war in which we are now engaged, has neces
sitated unusual preparation. Mighty forces are marshalling, great stores
of food and munitions are being gathered, and the energies of the nation
are focused on problems incident to the war.
At the very beginning of the war, the whole Bell System was placed a
the disposal of the Government. No nation has entered the war with such a '
comprehensive and efficient telephone service.
As our military establishment grows, the demands of the Government
upon the Bell System are bound to increase and always they must take prece
dence over all others. '
Increased activity in commerce and industry as the result of larger de
mands for food and munitions from our allies and for our own use, means
more need of telephone service by private business.
But private business must always be subordinated to the Government service.
Each individual American will co-operate in this patriotic service, and submit
cheerfuly to inconvenience or delay in his telephone service, when he under
stands how. vital it is that Government service shall take precedence over 4
all else.

- A bellhop in a New York hotel had a lot of bad luck
the other day when some one stole his auto and wrecked
it This poor bellhop doubtless has to go to his work
now in a street car or a taxi. What a shame! It is hard
enough to answer calls all day and lug ice water all over
a big hotel without having to crowd in with the plebians
and common herd on the streets when one goes off duty.
A speaker of the National Defense League declared
recently in a public statement, that "Germany was never
so strong as she is right now." These are ominous word
for every citizen of the United States. They mean that
we have a giant's part to play in the Great War before it
shall have ended. And it must be borne in mind that
this statement was made before Russia collapsed so
shamelessly this week.
Chancellor Michaelis boastfully announced to the
half rebellious Reichstag that none but a victorious peace
woud be accepted by Germany. And then the crown
prince tried to make good the chancellor's boast. But
their teamwork was bad. The fortieth attack upon th
Chemin des Dames failed as had the previous thirty-nine
Thousands of the pick of the Prussian forces were sacri
ficed for the new chancellor's boast, and all in vain.
Words are cheap, runs the old saying, but the words
Michaelis uttered the other day were about as costly as
any ever spoken by any man.
The American Federation of Labor is taking drastic
steps to rid its organization of German spies and agenU.
President Gompers himself presided at a special meet
ing in New York recently at which steps were taken
to begin the work of systematically weeding these vipers
from the workmen's ranks. If the federation would take
the sane steps against the L W. W. it would be almost,
if not quite, as great and as beneficial work as that of
ousting traitors. In fact, of the two, the L W. W. up to
this time have done the union much more harm than
have the German spies, and have done almost as much
to the country at large.
Seattle, the queen city of the north coastline of the
Pacific, is threatened with ruin from labor troubles.
Three strikes at once oppress this city. After many years
of uninterrupted progress and prosperity that were the
wonder and the envy of the west, this proud city now
bows her head in fear of her very industrial life. T3'e
traction strike is the worst of the three, if there is such
a thing as worst. With her docks and her streets tied up
she is like a crippled man in a mile race against a man
on a motorcycle. Already the strikers have lost $100,000
in wages and the employing companies have lost hun
dreds of thousands more.
Government statistics recently Issued show that
there were three million five hundred thousand automo
biles in the United States in 1916, a gain of more than
a million over 1915. Estimating that the gain this year
is at least more than a million, there are nearly five
million cars in use in this country at this time. This
means an investment of at least five billions of dollars,
and an additional expenditure of five millions a year to
keep these cars running. The auto industry is only about
fiften years old. What stupendous totals will it attain
ten years hence? Where will the fuel come from? The
rubber? Verily, this is a fast age. Events speed by like
a wild duck's shadow across a pond.
Not since Verdun have the Germans launched such a
determined and prolonged offensive as that which they
still persist in before the French lines on the Chemin dea
Dames. This Walk of the Ladies, as it is called In Eng
lish, was attacked for the . fortieth time yesterday by
the orown prince's forces without result further than to
covtr the field with German dead. The French troops
holding this sector are indomitable. No hurricane of
Prussian fire or charge of picked Prussian guards and
"shock" troops can dislodge them. It is estimated that
over 100.0fK) Germans have been killed and wounded in
this offensive. The crown prince seems to have learned
the lesson of Verdun badly. Not another foot of French
land for the invader, is the watchword all along the allied
line. But what a grim irony of war is this slaughter and
storm of steel along the Walk of the Ladies. Moonlight
and the thrum of guitar strings and lovers' sighs would
teem to be more appropriate for this place.
THE 8AN SIMON VALLEY.
That portion of Cochise county through which ex
tends the beautiful San Simon valley is attracting atten
tion over the country. In its last bulletin the U. S. Geo
logical surrey devotes most of its space to this valley, its
past history, its wealth of historic treasures, etc. In
regard to Its artesian water supply the bulletin says:
"Perhaps no part of the arid southwest has attracted
more general attention in recent years than San Simon
valley, in southeastern Arizona and adjacent parts of
New Mexico, in which a new epoch of agricultural de
velopment was started in 1910 by the discovery of arte
sian water.
"A careful and thorough study of the artesian and
other ground waters of the valley has recently been com
pleted by the United States Geological survey and the Ari
zona Agricultural Experiment station. This study was
made in order to furnish reliable information to numer
ous inquirers from all parts of the United States and to
give all possible help to the settlers in conserving the
water supply and in utilizing it most effectively.
"The total number of flowing wells in the vicinity of
San Simon in 1915 was 127. The flow of these wells
ranged from less than a gallon to about 300 gallons a
minute, and the average flow from 116 wells measured
in 1915 was 52 gallons a minute. The combined yield
of the 127 wells, if they flowed continuously, would be
about 15 second-feet, or 6,700 gallons a 'minute. Com
parison of the flows of 12 wells measured in 1913 and
1915 shows that in two years the aggregate yield of these
wells decreased 45 per cent and that individual welU
showed decreases in flow ranging from 20 to SO per cent.
This decrease is attributed largely to the filling of the
uncased wells with sand and the caving of the walls of
these wells, but in part to the depletion of the artesian
supply. The government geologists regard it of the ut
most importance to the future welfare of the valley that
all wells be properly cased to the bottom with heavy
t
casing and fitted with valves, which should be closed
when the water is not needed.
"A report on the valley by A. T. Schwennesen, of
the Geological survey, and R. H. Forbes, of the Arizona
Experiment station, has just been issued as Water-Supply
Paper" 425-A. copies of which can be obtained free by
writing to the Director, U. S. Geological Survey, Wash
ington, D. C."

SEND HIM OFF BRAVELY.
It Is the duty of every family from w!iii a son is
drafted to send him off bravely and with good cheer.
Partings are hard at best, and this one will be especially
so. The lad who Is going out to take his chances for
the good of his country and for the ideals which up
hold the world needs strengthening for meeting his test,
not weakening.
Let there be no tears. No boy who is dqing hU
duty should be made to feel like a criminal because he
is leaving mother, or sister, or his best girl. He ought
to feel that his womenfolk are just as brave as he is
or braver1 and that they stand right back of him in
spirit, and help him wUh their courage in the work he
has to do.
Give him a good send-off, folks at home! It's an
occasion for pride when a son is drafted. His family
should be proud of him. His nation is proud of him
The world will be proud of him.
Perhaps he will come back safe. But 'if he dies,
he'll go out of life as he went out of home bravely,
manfully, doing his duty and with a smile.
Good-bye, boy! Take care o' yourself! God speed
your victory!
Statement of 56 state and fourteen national banks
of Arizona at close of business June 20 and given out
this week by Jesse L. Royce, state bank comptroller,
makes a most admirable showing. Deposits in thet-e
banks total over sixty millions, a gain of fourteen mil
lions over last year. Loans total thirty-five millions, a
gain of over seven and one-half millions since last year.
Banks are the sure and certain index of the solid pros
perity of a state. These splendid increases are eloquent
of the growth and progress of Arizona.
"Red tape and personal jealousy are delaying the
efficient conduct of the war," write the Security League
heads to the newspaper of the. country. They might well
have added politics to the items enumerated In thaj grave
Indictment. Tis sad, 'tis true. Every day of delay now
means additional weeks of hard fighting to end the war.
Delay has been more disastrous to the allies every step
of the three years of hostilities than all the efforts of the
central powers combined. Delay cost England and France
the Gallipoli disaster. Delay cost the full fruits of suc
cess after the Marne. Delay's deadly fingers have messed
things in every campaign worse than German sIicIIb. But
all the delays that have before were like swallows in
flight compared to the American congress in its debate
of the food control bill.
"Champagne for American Soldiers," read the head
lines in the dispatches from France. Great business. Noth
ing is too good for the American soldier. He may have to
march in the sun and s'.ccp on the ground and fight in
trenches knee deep in mud and water, and he may have
to drink sheep dip while lying in a shell crater In No
Man's Land, but, by all the gods! he will have one draught
of nectar to draw on from his memory when these heavy
hours come. Champagne sold for four dollars a quart
before the war, and only a rich man could pour it Into a
glass. ' It costs somewhere around six or eight dollars
now, and only millionaires ran buy and drink it. But
the "Sammies" should worry. The best is none too good
for the men at the front. When they cross the Rhine
they will have beer, and it is a safe wager that most of
them will prefer the brown brew to the brilliant bubbles
of the grape.

of credit until he cashed a worthless
check in El Paso drawn upon the San
Simon Valley bank at San Simon, Ariz.
It wa ssaid Bean also victimized sev
eral jewelers of large sums and also an
automobile dealer in El Paso. He pur
chased with a worthless check a sec
ond hand Dodge machine. NO. 53668,
motor 103030. Bean is about 45 years
old, five feet eight inches, 180 pounds, i
good build and ruddy complexion. The
index finger of one band is missing.
SUNDAY'S BALL GAME.
All the advance dope available on
the ball game for Sunday between the
C. and A. and Junction Briggs teams

a whale. The month's layoff caused by
the strike may cause the delicate and
fast moving machinery of the infield
to get a little rusty but the old bat
ting eye will still be there, and the pep,
and the intense rivalry. It ought to be
a 3ood game.
The C. and A. band will discourse a
little concert music to keep the crowd
in a good humor while the athletics
are warming up. The band will also
play between innings. The appetite of
the fans ought to be whetted to a
feather edge after a month without a
"big league" game. Ata boy, ata boy!
All together, for Sunday afternoon at
the park!
