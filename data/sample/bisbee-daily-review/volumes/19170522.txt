(By Review Leased Wire).
ATLANTA. May 21. Fire
that started this after
noon in an obscure negro
section swept a broad path
through the residential section
of Atlanta, devastating scores
of blocks and destroying many
of the city's finest homes and
hundreds of negro houses. Al
though the flames were not
entirely under control tonight
they have been checked con
siderably, and fire officials be
lieved there was little danger
of further conflagration.
First estimates of the damage were
placed at between $2,000,000 and $3.
000.000. So far as could be learned
tbe only life lost was that of a woman
who died of shock.
The fire was confined to the north
eastern, part of the city and the only
business houses burned were several
warehouses. I
Wind Fans Flames
" A high wind carried the flames
northeastward with a SDeed which
soon outran the efforts of tbe fire de

first alarm tbe blaze began to as
sume the proportions of a conflagra
tion and fire officials called In sev
eral hundred men from the Fort Mc
pherson officers' training camp to aid
in the fight. Appeals for help also
brought fire equipment from a half
dozen neighboring cities.
The dramatic struggle with the
flames reached a climax at nightfall,
when the fire fighters made a stand
at Boulevard Place and began dyna
miting a wide area to protect tbe
Ponce de Leon section. The effort
was only partly successful, and an
bour later the dynamiters began their
work over again, two blocks, beyond
the avenue. A lull in the wind fav
ored their work and tonight they were
ebout holding their own. though many
feared that before morning tbe flames
again would "gain headway and burn
their way through to the dge of the
city.
Many Minor Injuries
The thousands of homeless were
being cared for tonight by a citizens'
committee and by the Atlanta Red
Cross chapter. Most of them were
quartered in jublic buildings. Many
minor injuries were reported but of
ficials say there bad been few per
sons badly hurt.

HOUSE EXPECTS
VOTE TODAY ON
WAR TAX BILL
Southern Members Kill Pro

Auto and Motorcycle Taxes
Modified.
(By Review Leased Wire). '
WASHINGTON, May 21. Two
speaking contests during considera
tion of tbe war revenue- bill in. the
house today resulted in southern
members killing a proposed tax of
$2.50 a bale on raw cotton and rep
resentatives of automobile manufac
turing' districts limiting the five per
cent levy on automobiles, motorcycles
and the! rtlres to plants paying an
nual profits above $5000 and eight
per cent on capital invested.
House leaders, said tonight they
were determined to bring the bill to
a final vote tomorrow night
Victory of the cotton forces was
greeted joyously by those interested
In the domestic sugar' industry. Had
the cotton proposal been held ger
mane, the bill will have been open
to amendment carrying a tax on su
gar. The automobile tax amendment of
fered by Representative Doremus, of
Michigan, was written into the bill
after a futile attempt bad been made
to strike out the entire paragraph re
lating to a five per cent tax on auto
mobiles, motorcycles aTld tires. Mr.
Doremus insisted that many automo
bile manufacturers were barely mak
ing expenses. Democratic Leader
Kitchin quoted statistics to show that
the industry was enjoying unprece
d en ted prosperity.
Many small automobile manufac
turers, according to supporters of the
amendment are making much. less
than eight per cent and this provi
sion, if enacted into a law, will save
their businesses.
A proposal by Representative Gil

Lack of transportation for coal, the
trade commission report says, probably
will be remedied by the Interstate
Commerce Commission and by the
Council of National Defense. These
measures include regulations for the
distribution of cars, expedition of ship

and demurrage privileges and

more cars or by discontinuance of un

Aside Temporarily By Senate,
Pending Several Amendments
(By Review Leased Wire).
WASHINGTON. Mav 21. Food lee-1
islation was temoorarilv laid aside late i
today by the senate. After several
hours' debate the first bill, providing
for a food survey, the liennsing t
dalers, and steps to prevent hoarding,
was sent back o the committee for
reacting to include saveral of various
amendments offered.
Quicker action on legislation to con
trol foodstuffs is expected f- result and
Senator Gore, chairman of the food
commtitee, did not object to further
i a. r m a. i '
consideration of the measure in ii
present form because 6f amendments
Offered and others held in waiting.4
Division of food legislation into two
main sections producton and regula
tion probably will be agreed upon by
the commitltee. - The administration
bill introduced in the house by Rep
resentative Lever, dealing with stimu
lation of production, was introduced in
the senate just before adjournment to
night by Senator Gore. It will be con
sidered tomorrow by the senate com
mittee. Regulation of food supplies end the
appointment of a fo'od administrator
will be subjects of a separate bill. This
new measure will be introduced in tbe
house tomorrow and the senate prob
ably will not take up regulation legis
lation until the house acts.
The bill dealing solely with steps to
augment production of fc'jdstuffs. It
is believed, will be promptly enacted.
That covering the question of regula
tion promises long and vigorous dis

Senators Reed and Underwood, both
Democrats, Indicated Opposition to

Whether prohibition legislation will
be considered as a part of the food

another question raised and not dis

Uncle Sam has offered to the American people a $2,000,000,000
Liberty Bond issue. These bonds will help pay for the great war for
world freedom. If you Buy a Bond for Baby you will be doing two
good things helping America win the war and giving Baby a stake
in life.
At compound interest Baby will have $161.82 at the end of 15
years, figuring on three per cent compound Interest If your bank
pays a higher rate Baby will, of course, have more.
In case of necessity Baby's Bond can be sold at any time. If the
government does not wish to take up the bonds at the' end of 15 years
it may let them run for 15 years more, In which case Baby's Bom!

DEFINITE OFFER OF HOME
RULE IDE TO ISO BY
BRITISH PRIME MISTER
All Sections, Parties, Creeds And Factions Invited To Con
vene And Draw Up Constitution For Own Government;
Great Britain Will Abide By Whatever Agreement Is
Reached, Is Promise of Lloyd George; Nationalists And
Ulster Doubtful of Plan.
LONDON, May 21. (1 1 :55 p. m.) For the first time in
modern history, the destines of Ireland are to be placed in
the hands of the Irishmen alone. The British prime min
ister, David Lloyd George, announced to the House of Com
mons today that the government will call a convention of
Irishmen to draw a constitution for Ireland and if Irishmen are
able to agree upon any scheme for the administration of their
country, will attempt to enact it into legislation without delay.
All sections, parties, creeds and factions, the clergyman and
laymen as well as politicians and even revolutionists of the
Sinn Fein Society, will be invited to get together.
If this final attempt succeeds a political miracle will have
been accomplished. There is no great optimism apparent re
specting the success of the plan, for Ulster stands where she
has always stood. Sir John Lawndsale, of the Irish Nationa'
ists predicted the same old deadlock declaring that Ulste-.
would not be driven into a home rule parliament and predict
ing that the Nationalists will not consent to the exclusion of
six Ulster counties. But if the attempt fails, the failure will
deprice the ancient charge that England is the "oppressor" of
much of its force, and it is pointed out that Ireland can hardly
be hailed before the European peace conference as another
Poland while America and the colonies can no longer reproach
Great Britain with having neglected to set her own house in
order.
All Factions Urged to Attend Convention
. Both houses of parliament discussed
Ireland today, with hardly a ripple
of tbe old animosities and feuds dis
turbing their harmony.
"The. parent must administer to
bimself," said Mr. Lloyd George. A
noteworthy feature of the discussion
was an agreement that politicians
must play a secondary part to the)
men from other walks of life. The
premier specified the Nationalist fac
tions, of which John Redmond and
William O'Brien are the leaders, and
tbe Ulster, tbe Southern Unionists
and Sinn Feiners as the political
bodies which were invited to the con
vention, but said that the government
considered it most important that
representative so local governing
bodies, the churches, trades unions
and commercial educational interests
should participate.
Mr. Redmond agreed in this policy,
and the veteran Home Rulers even
offered to obliterate himself in the
interests of harmony. But the house
refused to accept his offer.
Even Lord Lansdowne, who has
been charged by some with the
wreckage of Lloyd George's previous
work of reconciliation, told the lords
that tbe road to home rule had been
traveled too far for turning back, and
referred to the Importance of facilitat
ing the task of "those who are our
ft lends in America."
For the position of chairman of the
convention, a colonial might wield
strong influence for harmony, and
Baron Shaughnessy, president of the
Canadian Pacific Railroad Company,
who ' was born in the United States
cf Irish parents, is mentioned, as also
are ex-Premier Asqulth and Lord
Donougbmore, who have special tal

admitted controlling about 40 per

trade, but defended itself, by stating
it was a "good" combination.
Tbe suit against the harvester com
pany was filed In the United States
district court in Minnesota in 1912.
Its dissolution was asked mainly on
the ground of its size .and Inherent
power. This corporation also con
tended that it Is a "good" combina
tion, but the lower court ordered dis
solution. Tbe suit against the United States
Machinery Company was filed in 1911
and the lower court dismissed the
government's petition.
The two cases against the Lehigh
Valley railroad and the Reading rail
ent for a position requiring large
parliamentary experience and much
dip.omacy.
It is expected that the selectV.n

tion will be made within a week.

all war releif by individuals and organ

the committee expect to be in a posi

UNITED VERDE MINERS
PREPARING TO STRIKE
(By Review Leased Wire)
JEROME, Ariz., May 21. The local
Miners Union today voted 543 to 25
to call out the employes of the Unit
ed Verde mine and spelter on strike.
The vote will be officially announced
lomorrow night after which the strike
becomes effective. It will undoubtedly
spread to the other mines of the dis
trict. : t
The union, demanded the Miami
scale, a closed shop, check off system
end grievance committees. The Unit
ed Verde which met ' the increase of
fifty cents daily ,to $5.25 and in which
the 'other companies followed suit,
refused the other demands. The com
panies took a vote of the miners as
they came off shift and It resulted
in 437 for a strike and 76 against; the
vote at the Gadsden was 4 to 23.
If non-union miners attempt to
work it may cause trouble. There Is
no local military organization except
some guards which include many un
ion members.' There Is practically no
liquor- obtainable. Union leaders are
telling the' men that the government
is sure to take control of the mines
and grant the demands.
United Verde produces between six
and 8e"en million pounds of copper
monthly and the United Verde exten
sion about five million.

signed to provide a five per cent war
tax on musical instruments selling

These taxes, as well as one or half
a cent per linear foot on unexposed
motion picture films, and another of
one cent per foot on exposed films,
were adopted as drawn by the com
mittee. An amendment was drawn
which would levy this tax on all goods
affected by the section, purchased af

retailers when the bill goes into ef

MYSTERIOUS LIQUID '
EXPLOSIVE BAFFLES -;
LOCAL AUTHORITIES
Police and county officers yesterday
and last night were working hard to
discover the Identity of the person or
persons who placed an explosive liquid
in the locks on the doors of the local
t'junty jail and the office of John Fos
ter, which nearly caused serious in
jury to three persons Sunday morning.
The jail door was opened by Officer L.
H. Rice, with Deputy Sheriff Red Gan
non standing close to him. As Rice
eeeeeeeeeeeeae shrdl m HM RF II RF
placed the key in the lock, the liquid
which had been poured in exploded.
The concussion of the explosion, al
though f considerable force, did not
injure Rice other than to cause his
hand to fetel numb for several hours.
An analysis of the liquid explosive
showed it to be a mixture of nitro
glycerine, iodine and other ingredients.
Foster was also made the victim of
an explosion when he 'opened the door
of his office Sunday morning. Owing
to the fact that but a small quantity
of the explosive had been placed in tii
door, Foster, too, escaped injury. Rice
was inclined to take the matter as a
joke, but City Marshal Jimmie Allison
nevertheless announced that he intend
ed to find out wh'j was 'responsible for
the affair and soe that tiie person or
persons were prosecuted! ;
Foster declined to make any state
ment regarding the Incident. It is not
believed by the officers- that any at
tempt was made on their lives, as bota
charges of explosives were light and
did not even seriously .damage the
doors or l'ocks when .exploded.

country now faces a serious situation,
the commission declared. In obtaining
a commodity basic to virtually every
form of military and industrial activ

The increase in demand has been
ereat. In 1916 shinments of cjal troo
the mines amounted to about 509.000,-
000 tons, about 66,000,000 greater than
in 1915. This was due, the commission
found, to industrial expansion and to
increased railroad traffic.
The commission recommended . that
coal miners be exempted in the army
draft and be urged to remain at work.
Sneculatine brokers, as well as pi
ducers, were charged with responsibil

composed largely of homes ranging
In value from $2500 to $6000.
Relief Is Quick
The blaze started in the Skinner
Storage Company's plant which is al
most surrounded by small frame
houses. '
The presence of soldiers directing
traffic, guarding household goods and
keeping people fom the ramaged rone
gave the appearance of martial law.
As far as had been reported tonight
good ordpr was maintained.
The fire had swept only a few
blocks before relief measures were
undertaken by the Red Cross and the
Associated Charities who joined their
forces.
Food was provided at the armory
for five thousand people. Array
trucks, express wagons and private
automobiles were pressed into ser
vice to handle the foodstuffs, the re
lief workers announcing they were
"going to feed everybody who is hun
gry."
Dynamite Is Used
Some of the most serious losses
were in the section where dynamite
was used, scores of pretty homes in
a comparatively new district of the
city being blown up. Aided by wide
Ponce de Leon avenue and the slowly
dying winds, soldiers, fiiwmen and
private citizens blew up whole blocks
cf houses. Now and then a home
cn the North side of the avenue would
catch fire but for almost two hours
these outbreaks were stopped. Then
the flames gained .a foothold across
the street, swept on a block to Vedo
Way and late tonight were moving
slowly on in a northeasterly direc
tion. Mayor Candler issued a statement
tonight saying outside offers of help
would be unnecessary.

(By Review Leased Wire).
NEW YORK, May 21. Industrials,
notably the steel and Iron stocks,
ruled today's active but relatively re
stricted market to an extraordinary
degree.. Inquiry for tnose issues
seemed to be prompted by additional
trade advices of a highly favorable
tenor. Extensive short covering and
growing public participation were ae-.
celerntine factors. 1
United States steel occupied its
customary commanding; position and
contributed almost 33 per cent to the
total of 950.000 shares. At its ex
treme rise of Z points to 125 the
stock came within four points of its
record, made in the latter part of
1916. -
Related stocks like Crucible and
Colorado Fuel took rank amcpig the
ether stronger and active issues at
pains of 2 to 3 points.
Rails were intermittently prominent
but failed to register more than mod
erate pains. .
Easier tendencies were ' shown in
exchange rates on London, Paris and
Petrograd. Domestic monetary ac
commodations were unaltered ja
elieht demand.
Bonds were firm, a condition to
which enlarged Inquiry for interna
tionals contributed appreciably. Total
sales par value $3,075,000.
United States bonds were un-

Is Big Feature.
Annette Kellermann Is the foremoa.
artist of her type in all the world. Her
personal story is almost as remarkable
as tbe one she depicts for you. This
justly-famed woman, whose aquatic
feats have given her world-wide rep
utation, and whose figure is regarded
as tbe standard of feminine perfection.
was born in Australia. As a one-day-old
infant her body was placed in a
tin quart measure and there was room
to spare. She was a weakling child,
and all through her earlier years she
was obliged to wear metal leg braces.
Swimming and athletics made her the
most perfect Ihirg specimen of her
sex.
Miss Kellermann was the first wom
an in the world fo establish long-distance
swimming records, almost all of ,
which have never been equalled. In
the world ot tbe theater she is uni
formly a favorite with millions of' pt
pie, who have seen her either in impor
tant musical productions or in Ameri
can vaudeville.
William Fox, the producer of "A
Daughter of the CJds," which plays at
the Orpheum May 24 and 25. wishes to
pay tribute to his splendid star. She
is a woman of vast courage and great
resources. She is brave, patient, gra
cious and charming; a woman of ever-
increasing popularity and every bit of
which reward sihe richly deserves.

"REDEEMING LOVE"
FEATURE AT EAGLE
There is no greater love than that
; which perseveres despite different
views and ambitions even despite
powerful conflicts between tliise who
love each other. It is thir sort of an
-affection which forms the theme of
j"Redeeming Love," in which Kathlyn
j Williams makes her debut as a Moros
co star on the Paramount Program.
In this great drama, which is the at
traction at the Eagle Theater today,
Miss Williams is a girl who has be
come a pibfessional gambler, and
Thomas Holding, formerly of the Fam
ous Players Company, is a young min
ister who, despite the fact that he
! loves her. is the leader cf the crusado
.against Naomi and her followers. In
.the conflict between these two there
is developed a powerful drama.

William Courtenay, who plays the
leading male l'jle with Lucille Lee

Ramsey Morris' well-known stage suc

Theater today, gives a splendid charac

Mr. Courtenay plays this role, with

i -DISOWNING THEIR RACE."
it
The loyalty of our German citizens, which has been 8
cause of such warm satisfaction to Americans in general
since the war began, has produced quite a different effect'
in Germany. Many representatives of the German press
are said to be bitter in their condemnation. A dispatch
from Amsterdam quotes one newspaper as saying:
"German-Americans could not betray their old mother
country more shamefully, seeing that nobody will assert
that the existence of the United States is endangered by
Germany. The more pitiful is the cowardly seal with
which the 2,000,000 German-Americans in their national
associations disown their race in time of distress.
"The term 'German faithfulness is hereby forever
dishonored. Nothing any longer binds us to these 'Ger
man' Americans. We only cherish one wish, that as
speedily as possible they erase the word 'German' from
the name of their organizations, its use being as insult
ing to the German people as to themselves."
This will interest all Americans of German ancestry
as an example of what a considerable part of the men
who presume to speak for the Fatherland expected of
them before and think of them now. It is not calculated
to make many of our adopted Teutons regret their choice
of allegiance. Few indeed are the German-Americans
who do regard it as an Insult to suggest that they might
have acted otherwise than as loyal Americans, ready to
perform any duty their chosen country assigns them.
Of course there is no conceivable "betrayal" in such
loyalty. Our German citizens have not "disowned their
race." They have merely disowned the German govern
ment And in fighting it, they are fighting for the true
Germany as the Germans at home will do when their
eyes are opened.
WELCOMING THE WOMEN.
Our higher institutions of learning are falling into line
in recognizing the rapidly changing status of women.
Colleges and universities are admitting girl students to
courses heretofore held sacred to men. The president
of a conservative middle-western university, announcing
the proposed admittance of women for the first time to
the medical and law departments, says:
"Women will be obliged to take the place of men, with
or without their preference, in a great mnay professions,
especially in the medical. Looking to the time after
the war, there will be a diminution of immigration and
women will have to go into many lines of work now en
tirely closed to them. They will have to do men's work
and their own. Therefore I believe we should give them
every possible training that will make the world a little
bit less sorrowful and a little more efficient."
It's well that the inevitable fact is seen so clearly ic
the fastnesses of scholastic institutions. They no longer
resist the "feminist movement." They are forced by war
exigencies to accept it as a matter of course, and help
it along instead of fighting it It's good for the colleges
and good for the women.
The movement means a greater burden than women
have ever borne before. As the university president re
marked, "they will have to do men's work and their
own," for no matter how they may extend their sphere
of action they can never escape the duties for which
nature has particularly fitted them. But inasmuch as the
change means new freedom, new interests in life, new
possibilities of growth and power, they welcome it.
Women never have been shirkers.
NEW SHARK INDUSTRIES.
Southern California has suddenly learned to approve
of sharks that is. the sharks that abound in southern
California waters. They are the oil, leopard, angel and
blue sharks, none of them man-eating.
These sharks have always been plentiful, but no use
has been known for them. And as they devour game fish
by the thousands, sport fishermen have despised them.
Now, however, their status has changed. The United
States Bureau of Fisheries has been making experlnftents
and has found that shark hides make good leather. The
skins of leopard sIiarkB are fine and soft and will he
used for fine shoes, belts, gloves and other light leather
goods. The huge basking sharks and the blue sharks
have very touglit skins, and they will be used for leather
goods that have harder wear.
Shark oil. too. has proved useful for roofing and similar
purposes. It sells at 35 cents a gallon. The oil shark is
the largest of the group, growing to half the size of
a whale.
People of a commercial bent are now going shark
hunting1 for profit The sportsmen are delighted, for it
means better fishing for them when the tuna, yellowtail
and albacore fish re no longer routed from local waters
by the preying shark.
CONSTITUTIONALIZING THE KAISER.
The German Reichstag professes to be occupied with
a wonderful plan for reforming the political organization
of the empire and establishing a modern constitutional
government The outside world will be pardoned for
adopting a Missourian attitude regarding the matter. It
may be possible to institute a genuinely representative
government in Germany under present auspices, but it
doesn't look very probable.
For one thing, the German nation doesn't seem to have
awakened yet sufficiently to demand the necessary re-

SUNDAY WAR WORK.
Massachusetts, having abolished the old "blue law'
that forbade Sunday garden work along with other forms
of labor, seems to be going to the limit of liberality. A
church in Lexington has decided to omit its morning
services every Sunday throughout May and June in order
to allow its members to take proper care of their gar
dens. The pastor of another Lexington church has invited
women parishioners to bring their war-relief knitting
and sewing to church and work on it during the service.
Neither of these innovations will do any great harm to
the cause of religion. In fact, they are likely to promote
religion by restoring the church's waning popularity. But
what a change from the straight old Puritanism!

PENSION MORALS.
A New York woman Who has been drawing a $300 pen
sion from the city for ten years, as the widowed mother
of a fireman, has written to the fire commissioner saying
that ahe doesn't need the money any more, and wants
the pension discontinued.
"That woman is honest and patriot," declared the com
missioner, when he recovered from the shock. She is.
indeed! It seems to have been the first experience oi
th kind In the history of that department. Possibly it's
the first in the history of New York City, though we
shouldn't like to think so.
With this fine example, there ought to be a host of
pensioners hastening to make the same honest, patriotic
sacrifice.
The history of American pensions isn't exactly inspir
ing, except as proof of a grateful country's unquestioning
liberality. How many millions of dollars have been paid
out of the public treasury to war veterans or veterans'
families who had no need of it! How many thousand men
and women are still on Uncle Sam's pension roll who aro
more than able to take care of themselves, and wJ'o
would scorn to accept any sort of private charity?
It isn't a pleasant thing to think about, particularly at
the beginning of another great war.

LIBERTY LOAN WILL
BE EXPLAINED TODAY
AT ROYAL MEETING
Commercial Club Stages Big
Meeting This Evening At
The Royal Theatre To Ex
plain Objects And Reasons
For Big Loan.
Under the auspices of the Warren
District Commercial Club, the Royal
theatre, on Main street, this evening
Bt 7:30 will be the scene of a meeting
in the interest of the "Liberty Loan."
The meeting is in line with the sug
gestions made by the secretary of the
treasury that civic bodies get together
in order that the objects and mean
ing of the loan be made clear to the
general public.
About half of the two billion dol
lar bond issue has been subscribed.
This half was forthcoming from the
outset. It ' consisted of the profits
which business, and particularly big
business, has accumulated in the past
few years and which has not gone
back into investments. It consists
of the liquid surplus assets of big
business.
That investment cream, however,
has now been skimmed and the sec
ond line of financial defense and, af
ter all, the big one is the object ot
attack. The line is the "ordinary
fellow"; he who earns a salary, bs
who saves a few dollars every month
and in whose hands the great major
ity of the country's money is to be
found.
Anticipating'the campaign which is
being launched in behalf of the Lib
erty Loan the Commercial Club's di
rectors, some days ago. met and de
cided that a, mass meeting should be
held. The various members of the
organization have been circulated and
a large proportion of the membership
will, undoubtedly, be present. The
meeting, "however, is not confined to
members of the club. It is open to
every man and woman In the War
ren District. Inasmuch as the object
of the affair is to disseminate infor
mation regarding the project, a .big
meeting will more fully encompass
the object of the club.
A good speaker has offered Ms ser
vice to explain the loan; its uses,
the reasons behind it, the income
from it. the taxation features of the
issue and, in short, to tell all there
is to be learned of the entire matter.

All the People of Arizona." The call
should be heeded without delay.
Surely the people of this state will

at once. Here is the appeal:
To All the Citizens of Arizonar
Today we face the necessity of rais
ing our First Arizona Infantry' Regi
ment to war strength either by volun
tary enlistment of by the draft. Vol
untary enlistment is a credit to the
man who gives his services and Ari

than by having her young men volun

strength.

and sisters, facing as they do the ne
cessity' of loved ones absent in the
service of their country, I ask aid and
co-operation. In the hands of all the
people of this state is Arizona's an
swer to the call of our country and
president. Delay means the drat,
with no choice of service for the
young men who go.
America has entered this war on
the side of liberty and humanity
Honoring the memory of those who
fcuht for those principles In the Rev
olution, who first established liberty
and humanity as the basis of our gov
ernment. It is fitting that the newest
state to enter the Union should be
the first to raise its quota to defend
those principles.
It is the duty of every, man. woman
and child in Arizona to urge enlist
ment on those liable for service until
the required number represents Ari
zona at the front, that Arizona's rec
ord may be an example to all the
states. I ask the aid of every loyal
citizen of Arizona in urging that men
who are liable for service volunteer
now and take their places as members
of our First Arizona Infantry. To the
young men who are of the prescribed
age I would say "Go, and go now.

WANTED TO KNOW.
Saturday afternoon a number of
spectators were amused in the Su
perior Court at Tombstone over the
question asked by a young negro, who j
was up for sentence for forgery. The
Judge informed the defendant, Kyle,
that the penalty for forgery was from
one to 14 years, that it was a very
serious offense and that he might
give him 14 years. Upon hearing this j
the colored man quickly asked, "Well,
how about them one years. Judge?"
When orders had been secured, the
court sentenced him to serve a term
of not less than one nor more than I
three years.

Bisbee, Arizona.
Bisbee, Ariz., May 21st. 1917.Ajo Mining and Development Company,
Gentlemen: ,
We have made an exhaustive examination of your holdings and have found the representation as
made by ycur Manager, Mr. A. W. Bramwell, wholly truthful.
Your property comprises some 38 claims, 28 of which are located in the Gunsight Mountains and in
clude the famou Burro-Burro and C. and C. mines which were recently acquired by lease and bond. On
the Burro-Burro and C. and C. dump are about 200 tons of good shipping ore.
On your holdings proper a good camp has been established and a shaft, rtow some 20 feet deep, is
being sunk on the Flapjack claim. Feom this shaft some 20 ton of shipping ore has been extracted,
while from location shafts tome 30 additional tons of shipping ore was taken out and is now lying on
the dumps. Truly a remarkable showing for the two months the company has been operating.
Ten claim owned by your Company are located adjoining the New Cornelia Copper Company a
proven mine.' We confidently expect and have every reason to believe that the ore bodies proven to
exist by the development of the New Cornelia Copper Company extend into and underlie these claims..
All officer of the Company are eminently qualified to fill their respective positions; none receive
any salary and are honestly bending every effort to develop a mine
Respectfully submitted, OSCAR ZAPIF
