(By Review Leased Wire.)
WASHINGTON, Feb. 9 An expert
hospital force sufficient to care for
an army of a million men could be
mobilized by the Red Cross within a
few days after an outbreak of hostili
ties, is the belief of officials at the
hearquarters of the association here.
Eliot Wadsworth, acting chairman, es
timated tonight that the force which
could be mobilized immediately in
case of war would include:
Twenty-six completely equipped ar
my and navy base hospital units,
with a total personnel of 1200 nurses
and S99 nurses aides, a hospital base
reserve of 415 nurses and 525 nurses
aides; thirty-one partially complete
navy detachments of 20 nurses each;
one hundred and fifteen local emer
gency detachments and a corps of ex
pert instructors in surgical dressings,
totaling about 120.
Mr. Wadsworth said that all told
the organization could put Into the
field 2,970 trained Red Crows nurses J
and estimated that if 30 percent of i
those to whom the Red Cross had '
given elementary training responded
to the call as nurses' aides, the total
nursing personnel would be about
5.0O0.
"With the customary assignment
of 10 patients to each nurse, he add
ed, "we could thus take care of 50.000
sick and wounded at once. In the
earlier stages of war the proportion
of sick and wounded Is about five per
cent. In other words we are prepared
to tive expert nursing service to an
army of 1.000,000 men.

CONVOYING OF U. S.
SHIPS IS PLANNED
(Continued From Page One)
in American harbors because "of fear
that they -will be sunk if they pass
through the war zone is one of tiie
j questions being given careful con
sideration. As iar as couiu oe learneu
today there have been no reports to
the government of serious consequen
ces to industries but such reports are
expected and the enforced idleness ot
the merchant fleet is a subject of
growing exasperation.
Resent Treatment of Gerard.
Some resentment was expressed in
administration circles today over what
was construed as an implication of
bad faith in the request to Ambassador
Gerard that old treaties between Prus
sia and the rnited States be re-afliriu-ed.
tiiat such action was necessary to
make certain the rights of Germans
in this country guaranteed under these
treaties be secured. It was reiterated
that the American government fullj
intends acting according to the spirit
of the treaties. While the treaty
actually was abrogated by passage of
the seamen's law with a conflicting
section, the government here looks
upon the pact as at least furnishing
the guiding principle under which it
will act.
Neutral Action Pleases.
The administration is understood
to be highly gratified by the action j
taken by many of the neutrals in pro-1
testing with varyinK degrees of firm
ness against Germany's new subma
rine policy. While n'one has so far
followed the lead and suggestion of
the United States by breaking ofj
diplomatic relations nevertheless the
expression of sentiment was said t
be the chief object desired by Presi
dent Wilson in his action.
There is no expectation here that
she will modify her plans-or relent
sufficiently in her action of them to
allow even the present dangerous sit
uation to continue. In a sense, of
ficials feel that every submarine com
mander virtually has been entrusted
with a declaration of war against this
county.
The open issue as to German's treat
meet of Ambassador Gerard which j
has caused much ill feeling here, ap
pears to be c leared up. While ofli- I
cials have had no word from Mr. Ger- j
ard since he reported through Copen- j
j hagen that his departure was being '
j delayed, they accepted press dispatch- I
es. today as to arrangements for his j
' leaving tomorrow. j
1 OTicials maintained absolute silence
i on Mr. Gerard's detention until today,
j when Secretary Iansing authorized
the foreign statement.
"I am very loath to believe that the
German government intentionally is
detaining Ambassador Gerard in Ber
lin on any excuse whatsoever. 1
should be very much surprised if such
a course had been taken."
The subject will be considered
closed, so far as this country is con
cerned, if press, dispatches are borne
out xnd the ambassador is allowed
to leave Germany. Nevertheless a
disagreeatle impression has been cre
ated here.
Final arrangements for the depari
ure of former German officials on the
Scandinavian liner Frederick VIII
via Halifax for Christiana were com
pleted today by agents of the compa
ny and the : state department. The
I'nit.-d States, at the suggestion of
both the agents and Court von Btii
storff, asked s"oitv that the trip
e made via Halifax in order to avoid
the German war zone on the route
via Falmouth or Kirkwall, and the
British and French governments, in
granting safe conducts to the former
German officials, acceded to that re
quest, out of courtesy to this country
Only about half as much tonnage
as during each of the past three days
was reported sunk in Lloyd's dispatc h
es received at the department today.
Whether the sudden drop was due to
better British patrolling, armament or
destruction of submarines is not
kuown. The figures for the next tV
days, however, will be watched with
the depcst interest as indicative ot
whether the German attempt )
starve out England can he successful
Some oftiriaU- bliee thai while th

In this connection British officials
here claim that their figures show ;
that four boats out of every five that j
are armed, even with a stern gun. j
complete their voyages in safety. ,
Whether armament fore as well as aft
would be more efficacious is disputed .
but it is expected there will be large :
developments both along this line and
along the line of sending ships out ;
through safeguarded lanes under f:ist
convoy.
This was one; of the subjects dis
cussed today by the cabinet. Tables
taken up showed the number of ves
sels that enter and leave ports of the
British Isles annually, and covered
the number of ships sent down by the
Germans since the new sea warfare
became fully effective.
The statistics studied show that be
fore the war 6.1.OO0 vessels entered
ports of the islands annually and that
about the same number cleared.

In g a clay foot to be used as a model
in one episode, when he was tailed
to the telephone. ,
Cameras were ready and actors
were placed lor the taking of the
scenes. The director grew impatient
while he waited for the man to re
turn from the 'phone and finish the
piece. Only one toe remained to do,
and that toe held up the entire picture
force.
Then June Caprice leaped into the
breach. She gallantly arose ft'om her
place, walked to the tahle in front,
and bent over the clay foot. In a lew
seconds she turned to the director.
"Now it's ready," she said. And as
she moved amy, she disclosed the
complete foot on the stand. The pro
fessional could n'ot have done better.
Everybody complimented the beauti
ful little star.
"It was n.ithing to do," said June
deprecating!. "Only one tone why
anybody can make toes."
"You're wrong," said Harry Bcnhani,
who was watching. "Anybody can
make faces, but toes well, that's an
other proposition."

AT EAGLE THEATRE
j
Kenneth B. Clark Featured in
Mutual Offering at Eagle
Theatre This Evening.
The call of the wild is in most of
us and the desire to wander through
the green lichU and the forest glades,
living the life of a nomad without a
care In the world sometimes becomes
irresistible.. Kenneth B. Clarke has
selected this theme for lilin presenta
tion in the gripping heart drama of
outdoors. "The Abandonment, wticli
appears today at the Eagle.
The principal characters are Dr. Ed
wards Stewart, a talented oung phy
sician, and Emily Thurston, a societ
girl wrapped up in the frivolities of
her set. The doctor and the girf are
engaged but she resents his devotion
to his practice and his lack of interest
in the gaities of the social world.
Their engagement is broken and the
girl later ma;ries Benson lleaih, a dis
solute man alAmt town. Overwork
and the shock caused by the actions
of his fiancee breaks down the health
of the physician and he is advised to
rest fn the country. He sets out on
a long walk and fall in with a gang
of tramps. Attracted by their care
free existence he becomes a member
of this band of nomads and decides to
share their joys and sorrows.
In the meantime Heath gets into
trouble in the city and to escape ar
rest flees with Emily to a small West
ern town. Stewart now ostensibly a
tramp comes to this town with a
crowd of his fellows. The tramps pitch
their catnp near Heath's home and
one day Stewart goes to the- house
seeking food and iinds Emily being
abused by her husband. A quarrel en
sues between the men' tnd Heath is
killed. Emily .recognizes her rescuer
and realizes what a mistake she had
made a few years earlier. Beautiful
Helene Rosson has never appeared to
such excellent advantage as she does
in the role of Emily and makes the
most of the wonderful opportunties to
display that remarkabfe talent for
enrbtional expression which made her
famous.

MATCH TOMORROW
Globe Money Appears on
Streets and Is Promptly
Covered Tickets Going
Fast Begins at 2:30.
Globe money is reported goiug the
rounds of Bisbee in support of Lee
Rockier in his niafeh Sunday after
noon against Webtr ;il the Lowell Air
dome and quite a bii of n is being tak
en. it is said, without odds. Another
rig purse is said to be developing
among local backers of Weber, and is
likely will be plated today.
Both lit the Brunswick billiard par
lors in Bisbee and the Purity Drug
store in Ixjwell a brisk demand ex
ists for ringside seats to this match,
and not a few women are planning to
attend. There appears now serious
doubts if the uirdome will be big
enough to seat the crowd.
The two preliminaries are being
talked of as promising almost as pood
a treat as the main event itself, ac
cording to those who are in on the
"inside dope," ' and the headllner
should be the best the Warren Dis
irii t has seen for years.
Rockier again passed the day yes
terday "ruffing it de luxe" in the sur
rounding hills, his favorite system of
training, while Weber put in another
vigorous two hours on the mat at the
Y. M. C. A. with several trainers. Doe
Alexander is in Douglas today match
ing Rockier against a soldier wrest
ler, there, and will schedule other
matches in El Paso in the next two
weeks. He then will come back to
Bisbee.
in case Weber throws the Clobe
man, Alexander says he has another
tig fellow who has been mopping up
in these parts, ready to tussle with
the local champion.
Both men seem ta be in tho pink of
condition and the wiseacres are re
fusing to speculate on the possible
winner.

KULTUR ON THE HIGH SEAS.
As was to be expected, the world is appalled at the
frightfulness with which Germany lias inaugurated her
campaign of unrestricted submarine warfare. The death
scroll already is receiving its burden of victims' names
and details of this Teutonic phase of war's tragedy are
harrowing.
But seeking comfort, the mind should turn to a com
parison with the horrors alield where the enormous
casualties furnish an overwhelming ratio against the
deaths dealt by submarines. It also must be remembered
that the force of Germany's onslaught is greatest at this,
the beginning of the fearful campaign. Germany has
been preparing for the blow these many months. Her
fleet of submarines may be considered as having rear-luM
the limit of numerical strength ar.d the same may be
said of crews and munitions.
To make the campaign impressive, shocking 'successes'
must be accomplished at t'ie start. Every effort is
therefore being exerted to tiiis end. At the pace now
set, the loss in tonnage if maintained will be about on
million a month. The loss in life is a ncpligable quar.tit
with the militaristic lieutenants of the Kaiser.
England, upon whom the brunt of the campaign falls,
is as usual silent as to what progress is being made ii:
defense, but it need surprise uo one if history records
that Germany's losses began simultaneously with her
early submarine victories. But we don't hear of these
losses at the present time. They doubtless will be re
vealed soon, however, through information that shipping
is not paralyzed and that the exportation of food to Eng
land is possible of accomplishment.
Doubtless England, like the United States refused to
believe that Germany would put into actual operation n
program so. foreign to international law and so contrary
to the laws cf humanify, and for that reason neglected to
make ample preparation. But now that the peril has de
veloped, England may confidently be expected to provide
measures which will be an adequate response to Ger
many's latest sin cloaked in the guise of kultur.
ARIZONA'S RELICS. !
At the museum of thP University of Arizona recently a
.special committee of the Archaeological Society of Ari
zona met tor the purpose of drafting a request to the
Secretary of the Interior suggesting that no more per
mits be granted for excavating in the ruins of Arizona
other than those granted to the University of Arizona ,
and the United States Bureau of Ethnology. j
The committee states that the University of Arizona
1 as earnestly taken hold of the development of the ;
museum in giving courses in anthropology aiid arohe- ,
ology, and has in cooperation with the Arizona Arche
ology Society taken up the systematic field work in the
exploration and study of the prehistoric culture of the
state, and proposes to continue that work through the
succeeding year. It is indeed important that the re
maining ruins in tlte state be reserved for the investi
gation of the. U. S. Bureau of Ethnology and the Univer
sity of Arizona, exclusively.
Many of the best ruins have been already partially i
destroyed, and the contents carried away to grace
museum collections in other countries and other parts !
of the United Strtes. The best of these ruins must be 1
repaired and preserved. This can be effectively done :
enly by the hearty cooperation of the United States gov- j
ernment and the government and people of Arizona. By j
restoring and protecting the best of the ruins now sur- 1
riving, and by keeping the rest of their arts and indus- :
tries here where they were produced, typical prehistoric
homes and evidences of their social and religious customs
mpy be seved for a thorough study of these first inhahi- '
I tants of the state.
In view of the fact that the best of Arizona's prehis- .
toric treasures have already been moved elsewhere and ,
in view of the fact that we must have the hearty cocpera-
tion of the people of the state, if the ruins and relics are j
to be preserved for the instruction and enjoyment of the j
people of the whole country, is it not fitting that permits j
to excavate and remove material henceforth be confined i
to the investigators connected with the Bureau of j
Ethnology and the University of Arizona?
COURTING A COURTHOUSE.
Now that Tombstone and Douglas iiave seemingly
passed the flirtation phase of dallying witii the courthouse
project and are inclined to enter into serious conversa
tion, it is high time that Bisbee called them to account,
stating thjat if there be any transfer of Cochise county's
scat of justice the edifice and all that pertains thereto
will find an abiding place right in the Warren District.
This decision to assert our claims is prompted by the
loftiest motives. We are inspired by a desire to save
Douglas from her own indiscretion in seeking to despoil
Tombstone of an adjunct without which the thriving
bailiwick would suffer partial effacement.
Geographically, sentimentally and logically, Bisbee i
entitled to the courthouse if it is decided to make a
change. The fact that our convincing claims have n'.t
been pressed is due solely to a generous consideration of
the grief that would overwhelm Tombstone if deprived
ot her pet institution. We marvel at the grasping tpiri:
disclosed by Douglas, and the marvel grows when it is
taken into account that the Smelter ity while pressin",
a hopeless suit can expect to attain no more than the ani
mosity ot her neighboring city.
Tin- s"f iuipca hm-nt is bxic' -l tli;it Supervisor Sparks
in his capacity as a contractor may ltar selfish ino'ivr
in driving to cure the courthouse (or Douglas'. lYris'i
the thought! Mr. Sparks has proven too often that per
sonal considerations have no part in his activities as a
county official. Douglas, it is true, could well spare a
site for a courthouse, thereby ing at least one void uf
her ample landscape. Bisbee, on the other hand would
be called upon to make a sacrifice through the allotment,
of a location. But such sacrifice will be made cheerfully
in the iiitcreit.; of L,e county if. In order to redeem
Iug!a;; from ill advised trove the weight of public
opiniou decrcvj th.it the courthouse must be removed to
Bibber.

"amazed'' at the anger stirred up in thi.. country by the
repudiation of their l'-boat pled 4 -s. More 'ru.ssia I

A MUNICIPAL ARMY.
If a break with Germany occurs, and that break is
followed by hostility either from without or within, j
there's one part of the Union at least that professes itself j
ready "for any eventuality." That is New York City. j
The metropolis has suffered much criticism because of j
its alleged war spirit, but it must be admitted that the j
metropolis has the courage of its convictions. It is pre- j
pared. It has an army ready for action the police force. !
New York has a great foreign population. The city is !
taking no chances. If an uprising should be threatened.
it is announced, "Chief Inspector Schmittherger will !

A forte of 8,000 policemen will be automatically mobi
lized. TJiey have their instructions, and every man know:,
precisely where to go at a moment's notice. Half of them
have had military training. They would be used for fight- j
ing, if fighting were required. The rest would stand j
guard and do whatever needed doing. There are horse
men, motorcyclists, sharpshooters, machine gun opera-
tors, wireless telegraphers, electricians, engineers, sanf- j
tary experts, etc., all trained and ready.
Every foot of the city has been covered by a militarv
turvey. The predominant nationality of every precinct
is siiown by little flags on the police maps. Every
strategic spot or place of danger is charted. There are j
lists of radio stations, armories, halls, churches, etc., in- j
chiding all places suitable for detention quarters or '
refugee camps. There are lists of parks and vacant lots.
and of the merchants who would supply the lumber and
other materials necessary to build camps there.
The regular police, thus turned into a municipal army,
would 1m: replaced by a reserve police force called the
Home Defense League, which is made up of volunteers
"""i int-riiiri uiiu iitiinocrs more man lu.uuu men. i
Thousands of them have already received instruction j
and drill. 1
i
This efficient preparation, if it. is all that it claims to
be, shames the rest of the country. And if it comes i I
the worst, the country may find itself deeply indebted to
New York's "finest" for acting as a first line of defense. !

From Constantinople conies a dispatch saying that

the Nobel peace prize, as the world's "foremost lighter

The Kaiser may be trusted to refuse the honor, with

appropriate thing if he ihould a knowledge the Turks'

NEW YORK, Feb. 9 Lowest pric
es of the week and for a much longer
period in some noteworthy instances
were registered today n almost a
minimum of operations. Every part
of the securities list was affected ex
cept a few specialties in the equip
ment class, high grade shares losing
ground as well as the less responsive
issues. Offerings were moderate in
almost all cases, but it required only
slight selling to cause recessions.
Washington was the center of in
terest and Wsll Street buzzed with
rumors and gossip bearing upon the
probable course of international
events.
Trading in bonds was light. The
Anglo-French 5's made an extreme
decline of a half point to the new
low record of 90a4 and the latest Un
ited Kingdom issue also fell to a new
minimum. Speculative railway bonds
especially the convertibles, also re
ceded. Total bond sales, par value,
$3,660,000.
A few notable changes in storks in
eluded People's Gas of Chicago which
made an extreme decline of 9Vi
points on the unfavorable statement
for 1916. Local transactions also fell
two to 3Vs points with one to two for
shippings, motor accessories, coppers

CHICAGO GRAINS
CHICAGO. Feb. 9. Betterment of
conditions for railway traffic helped
to strengthen wheat today, and so too
did large clearances at the seaboard.
j Prices finished unsettled but half to
1 net higher with May at l.A9vi to
1.69 !i and July at 1.47 to 1.47. Corn
gained a shade to Vj, oats to and
provisions 15 to 40 cents.
Upward swings for wheat values
began right at the opening anil were
at no time given any lengthy interrup
tion. Settlement of a threatened
strike here that would have involved
the switchmen of IS railways tended
materially to favor the bulls, who
soon had a further advantage owing
to reports that the Canadian Pacifsr
line was sending 6u0 cars to Minneap
olis to take out wheat and flour for
the British government.
Corn prices hardened chiefly on ac
count of assertions that much of the
buying today for future deliveries was
for the seaboard.
Values in the oats trade were forti
fied by reports of liberal purchases
for Europe.
A sharp upturn in hog quotations
lifted provisions.

BOSTON. Feb. 9. The Boston mar
ket was dull and uninteresting, a nat
ural condition with approaching holi
day Monday. Lincoln's birthday. A
good demand continues for copper
metal at around 33 cents a pound for

situation cannot help but be reflected
in a better market for the copper
in the near future. The Calumet &.
