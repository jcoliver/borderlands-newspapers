Fuel Question Also Likely to
Be Investigated; Public to
Benefit by Action by U. S.
WASHINGTON", April 3. Conflict
between the industrial board of the
department of commerce and the rail
road administration cer steel prices
has developed a new question of
whether the board shall attempt to
arrange prices with basic industries
at which the public shall be asked to
maek purchases.
Reconsideration of the entire policy
of the board, with, possible consequent
"Withdrawal or revision of the steel
prices already announced, has been
decided upon. Conferences will start
tomorrow -between representatives of,
the board and the railroad administra
tion on which it is believed will de-
pend the future activities of the i
board. j
It developed today that the lengthy
conference yesterday, attended by
several members and the heads of all
the important government purchasing
agencies, decided to recommit to the
board the "entire matter" Involved in
the refusal of the railroad administra
tion to accept the new steel prices. It
was said that there was no intention
to recommit only the controversy
with the. railroad administration and
Chairman Peek's amendment to the
official statement issued by Secre
tary Glass, In whose office the meet
ing was held, was declared by the
- treasury head to have been unauth
orized and not to reflect the senti
ment of the conference.
Refuses to Talk.
Director General Hlnes': refused to
day to comment on ' the controversy.
Publication by the board for the
public guidance of a list of steel prices
which had not been accepted by the
.railroad administration and insistence
that the latter should accept the
prices after they were 'published
seem to be the points at issue, which
have divided government officials into
two opposing camps on the question
of price fixing. As originally consti-
tuted, according to official announce
ments made at the time, the board
was Intended to be an instrument of
mediation between Industry and gov
ernment purchasing agencies, to see
whether prices could be made suffi
ciently attractive to induce the gov
ernment to purchase "freely.'' It was
declared by men active In the crea
tion of the board that it was not in
tended that the board would endorse j
prices for the public, but that th.e'
acceptance of new prices by the gov
ernment was to eb the assurance of
the public that they were considered
fair on the basis of known costs.
"When the new steel prices were
arranged, the railroad administration
j:ave notice through its representative
on the board, T. C. Powell, that they
were not acceptable to the largest
purchaser of steel in the United
States. It was said that tehre was
some dispute between the board and
the administration as to whether the
notice comprised only rails, as con
tended by the board, or all fit eel
products, aa alleged by the latter. At
any rate, the announcement of the
new scale made no mention of the
prices being acceptable to the govern
ment, but offered them only as "sat
isfactory to the public."
New Price $45 Ton.
Steel rails were priced in the re
vised schedule at $45 and $47 a ton.
The railroad administration still is
receiving deliveries on contracts at
$36 to $40 a ton.

LAUD LEASE BILL
IS DECISION
Four Other Measures Also De
clared Dead by Attorney
General Jones
PHOENIX, April 3. The land leas
ing bill and four others carrying the
emergency clause, which were trans
mitted to the secretary of state by
Governor Campbell without executive
action, "are not the laws of the state
of Arizona under the constitution," ac
cording to the official written opin
ion of Attorney General Wiley Jones,
issued tonight.
The other bills affected by the attor
ney general's opinion are the amend
ments to the land code, carrying cer
tain salary raises, the . irrigation dis
trict bill, the county classification bill
and a relief measure.
It was reported earlier in the week
that parties unknown were prepar
ing to launch a court action to prevent
the operation of these measures, the
contention being, that an emergency
bill, to become law must carry the gov
ernor's signature or be passed by a
three-fourths vote of the legislature.
The attorney general at that time
would 'not give an opinion in the mat
ter though he pointed out the clauses
in the state .constitution, which, Be
said, he had been informed were the,
basis of the argument against .the
bills.
Today Secretory of State Mit Sims
asked for an official opinion and At
torney General Jones ruled against
the bills, as follows: ' '
"That the emergency measure men
tioned in your letter are not laws at
this time is plainly evident, is the
opinion of this department:
"It is sufficient to advise you, there
fore, at .this , time that the emergency
measures to which yoii have directed-
the attention of this department are !
not the laws of the state of Arizona '
under the constitution of the state, nor
should you act upon them as such, for j
tne reason mat me gui""" " ,
state withheld blB approval of said
measures."
The attorney general concluded his
opinion with the following paragraph
on an exchange of courtesies between
the governor and himself:
"On the 14th day of this month, I,
as attorney general, called at the gov
ernor's office through courtesy due to
him and offered my services and ad
vice to aid him in the legal and con
stitutional consideration of any mea
sures passed by the legislature and
presented to him for executive action.
The ' thanks of the executive were
courteously conveyed to me and by me
courteously "acknowledged. I felt that
my position required me to assume
the responsibility involved in my offer
to the governor, but my offer met-with
no response beyond the courtesy .
above mentioned." ' ' 'I

Dispute Over Boundaries Is

Efforts to Complete Treaty i
Principle of Self-Determination
Is ' Opposed in . Row
Oter Franco-Hun Frontier
PARIS, April 3. (By tho Associat
ed Press.) President Wilson and
Premiers Lloyd-George, Clemenceau
and Orlando continued their discus
sion at President Wilson's residence
today. Other peace conference organ
izations also met. All the 'confer
ences tended to unravel .the tangled
issues still standing in the way of
peace.
ine meetings proceeded amid an
other wave of apprehension spreading
through the conference over lack of
any tangible-results after the council
of four had labored continuously for
ten days.
This was accompanied by well-
founded reports from those close in
touch with the council of four show
ing that the situation, while not des
perate, was at least serious because
of radical differencesra some funda
mentals In the settlement of Ger
many's western, the Franco-German
and the eastern Polish frontier.
. Situation Difficult. .
One of the American experts, who
is constantly being consulted on va
rious questions before the council,
gives . the following glimpse of what
is going on behind the scenes.
"The situation is extremely diffi
cult, particularly as regards to the
western frontier of Germany. Presi
dent Wilson, in a conciliatory spirit,
has been willing to do most anything
to assure France security short of
the stultification of . . engagements
made at the time of the armistice.
"The French have been assured of
every military protection along the
Rhine and for fifty kilometers east of
that river, even to the extent of con
sidering that any mijlittary activity
In that section shall be looked upon
as a. hostile act. But this is not con
sidered enough and additional claims
lead, to the conviction that they are
open to construction as meaning some-
thing more than military security ana pr0ve a hardship to them, the com
verglng on, territorial control. ', Dany j3 reluctant to make any redric-
. .. ..-, Wilson Opposes Plan.
Tbe president is not willing to gOjry the present operating Iosb indefi-
that far -in creating more Alsace-Lor
raine : situations and it is this stand
against these claims which is caus
ing the delays until some middle
ground is found." .
Concerning reparations, it was add
ed that there were good prospects for
an early agreement. -This will not
specify the total amount, but will
leave it to a commission to work out
detaIla oI reparation through a period
ot . year8 Xbe priority of Belgium
and in tne division of the Ger-
m&a indemnity aiso i3 eaid to be near-
ln agreement.
As a means of finding the "middle
ground" on the Rhine controversy, the
superior council of four created a
consulting body consisting of Andre
Tardieu, France; Charles H. Haskins,
America, and Viscount Morley, British.
They labored until 2 o'clock this
morning and then called on Col. Edw
ard M. House before Beeing 'the coun
cil. To intimates they were not opti
mistic on the progress that Is being
made.
Self-determination Issue
Another of President Wilson's en
tourage said the real issue was wheth
er President Wilson's principle ot self-
determination was to be upheld. The
president, he said, did not regard this
na a nrinpiiile which should be applied
wben favorable to the entente aud not
applle(j ln a cages alike. Just now,

DOLLAR WAGE W
IN SILVER MINES
Demoralization of Metal Mar
kets Brings Decrease
at Leadviile
LEADVILLE, Colo., April 3; The
Iron-Silver Mining company, operating
the Mikado and other properties, has
announced a cut in wages of a dollar a
day, due, it i3 stated, to demoralization
in metal markets, especially lead and
zinc. The Yak mines, owned by the
American Smelting & Refining com
pany have also posted notices . of a
similar cut, and other lead-zinc mines
of the district will probably follow
suit. George O. Argall, manager of
the Iron-Silver company, made the roi
lowing statement: .
Owing to the low price of metals,
the increased freight and treatment
charges and the high cost of produc
tion, it has been found impossible to
profitably operate i this property. The
company cannot continue to mine out
the best grade of its ore reserves and
at the same time, sustain the addi
tional financial loss that present con
ditions impose. Either the operating
cost must be reduced or the mine must
shut down. In order to keep the mine
in operation we are compelled to ask
the employes to absorb part of the
burden to the extent of accepting a
reduction in wages of $1 per day to be
come effective May 1.
"Realizing that the cost of living
still remains high, and that to reduce
the amount paid to employes may
tion at aU We cannot,' however, car-
nitely. Since similar reductions fo
wage scales have been found neces
sary and have been made in other
base metal mining districts, and as
many mines have been forced to close
in spite of wage reductions, we sin
cerely hope that our employes will
agree to this plan, so that the local
mining industry may survive the ex
isting crisis."
It has been realized for some time
that reductions in the wage scale i
would be made, and a committee of
business men have been securing
pledges from dealers in food staples
that they would reduce their prices as
much as possible in order to enable
the miners to live under the reduced
scale which will be ?3.50 per" day.
There is no miners' organization in
this district.

rif.es and even machine guns are ope

northern Swiss frontier.
Poaching has increased alarmingly
in Bavaria since the revolution. More

PARIS, April (By the Associated
Press.) The latest . advices concern
ing the fighting at. Frankfort and the
renewal of the strike in Berlin con
firm the impression prevailing in Ger
many when the former -Berlin corre
spondent of the Associated Press left
there a week ago that the then com
parative lull in the manifestations of
industrial disorder and revolutionary
violence and pillage by the rabble
was only temporary.
Germany was at that time fairly
quiet, the only important exception be
ing a strike in the surrounding re
gion. The March insurrection in Ber
lin and the v disturbances in central
Germany and in east Prussia had been
suppressed; the flame of disorder was
only flickering in the Silesia coa
fields, while order was being main
tained in Bremen, Essen and other
cities, formerly scenes of Spartacan
uprisings, and the socialist proletariat
of Bavaria, although running affairs in
that state without regard to the cen
tral government, were not seeking any
occasion of conflict with the central
authorities.
Spartacans Energetic
Beneath the surface there were
abundant possibilities ot trouble. The
majority ef the German working men,
particularly the married men, wish its
work, although higher wages are be
ing constantly demanded, to meet the
rising co6t of" food. An energetic
Spartacan minority and the younger
irreprsibles, however, are constantly
causing trouble and preaching Bolshe
vist doctrines of reiterated political
strikes to dispossess factory owners
and overthrow the present govern
ment V ... : s ".
On earlier occasions, as at Berlin
and in the Ruhr region, these minori
ties had been able to Inveigle or per
suade others into Joining the strike
movement, producing higher wages in
case ot success, and holding out the
bait of abundant food shipments from
Russia if the government were over
thrown and an alliance concluded with
bolshevist Russia
Fear Minority
Tbo factory owners feared that the
radical minority might again dominate
their fellows if a new strike was call
ed under propitious circumstances,
particularly as there were a number
of big establishments, known collo
quially as "Liebknecht plants,"
where the workmen were largely Spar
tacan, who could be counted on to
give a most satisfactory impetuB to a
general strike by going out in a body
at a given signal. ;
Factory owiiers and others in close
touch with industrial conditions re
gard the distribution of American food
supplies at reasonable prices as the
only poslibility of mastering the strike
movement, re-establishing industrial
order and stimulating production.

(Continual from fnge Out)
in its purchase of coal and the re-':
fusal of the coal operators to undeV-i
take price revisions, unless the rail
road adminitsratiou agreed to accept
them previously, were answered by
Mr. IHnes in a statement explaining
the policy of the administration in
purchasing fuel. The statement said:
"An interesting friction appears to
eb receiving some currency as to the
administration In purchasing coal.
This friction is to the effect that the
railrcad administration is conducting
its purchases .of . oal lu such a way
to force producers; to. seil to it below
the cost of 'production, thus in turn
forcing the,m1tfWciease their prices
to the restiof the community! The
assertion p this friction seems to
carry with, it the suggestion that in
order to prevent the railroad admin-i
istration from accomplishing this pur-j
pose, it is important to find a way
to remove all competition in bidding
for such government business and
instead fix the respective mining dis
tricts uniform prices at which all pro
ducers would be willing to sell and at
which the railroad would have to
buy.
Evil Declared Fictitious.
"The remedy thus suggested for his
fictitious evil, would, of course, have
the result of giving , the coal opera
tors the relatively high prices fiexd
without any competition, which theyj
could use as absis for selling to the
generad public, so that the element
of competition would fade from the
picture and virtually, the whole con-1
suming public would be paying prices i
which in the aggregate would be farj
in excess of what would be necessary
to maintain existing wages and pay
sufficient profits. .
"While it hardly seems necessaiy
to do so, I wish to give the country
the assurance that the railroad ad
ministration has no such unjust and
short-sighted purpoes a3 to force pro
ducers" to sell below cost or impose I

THE BISBEE DAILY REVIEW; FRIDAY, APRIL 4, 1919.
THREE
FOUR BILLION DOLLAR
CONGRESSES TO RULE
' IN PLACE,.SAYS GOOD
Chairman of Appropriations
Next Session Reviews
Financial Outlook
WASHINGTON', April 3. The pass
ing of the "billion dollar" congresses
of pre-war days and the coming for
the peace period of "four billion dol
lar" congresses was predicted tonight
in a statement by Representative Good
of Iowa, who" will be chairman of the
appropriations -committee in the next
house.
Reviewing the financial problems to
D9 faced by the next congress Mr.
. Good estimated that the "appropria
tions necessary for the various govern
ment expenditures' in the fiscal year
ending June 30, 1921, would total more
than 53,800,000,000. Strictest economy.
be added, would be necessary to hold
expenditures down even to this totaL
"The next congress," said Mr. Good
In his statement, "will be brought
face-to-face with many new and intri
cate problems, and many of thtm will
call for large expenditures of money.
It is impossible to estimate what ex
penses will be involved In the future
in the administration of the railroads,
operation of our merchant marine, the
war risk insurance payments, and to
provide homesteads for our soldiers.
Forecast is Difficult
"While difficolt to make a reliable
forecast as to what expenses of the
government will be for the fiscal year
ending June JO, 1921, it is reasonably
safe to assume that the executive De
partments will most earnestly urge ap
propriations at least as large as those
appropriated for the fiscal year end-
Ing June 30, 1920, ior such appropria
tions were made to administer these
departments on a peace, basis. : -
"If we assume, however, that both
the military and naval programs will
' be greatly reduced and that our stand
ing army will be limited to 250,000
men, it will require rather strict econ
omy to bring the regular annual sup
ply bills under ?2,150,0O0,00O. : To this
must be added the permanent and in
definite appropriations of approximate
ly 51,650,000,000, or a grand total of
more than 53,800,000,000 necessary for
the various government activities. If
will require the exercise of strict econ
omy to hold the expenditures to ap-J
proximately Jhese figures.
Bonds Must Be Sold
Mr. Good estimated that the appro
priations made by congress for the ex
traordinary war expenses and fiscal
year ending June 30, 1920, totaled
more than 547,110,000,000. The revenue
to meet these appropriations, he esti
mated at 516,657,000,000 to be derived
through customs receipts and Income
and other taxes and $25,8S8,000,000 to
be raised from the sale of bonds, notes
and war savings stamps.
'The appropriations," Mr. Good add
ed, "to supply deficiencies in the va
rious departments are chargeable
against the fiscal year, ending June 30.
1919, and when deducted from the to
tal of the appropriations above refer
red to, it will be found that the total
revenue will fall Bh'ort of meeting the
appropriations for the fiscal year end
ing June 30, 1920, by approrimately
53-,500,000,000. A part of this deficit
will no doubt be made up from war
salvage ieceipts and the balance must
be met by the sale of bonds."

Tardy Justice Comes to Bill
: - prisonment on
.By a Staff Correspondent.
ONETJA, Alai April 3. Have
you served on a murder jury?
Have you ever Jield the life of
an accused tnurder in 4he hollow
of your hand? -
Have you ever found guilty of
premediatated murder a fellow
human being?
Some day you may be called
upon to do this.
And when you are, l Tjeg of you
that you will remember the case
, of BiII j Wilson, released from
prison today. -
This is the testimony in his
case. Suppose for tne moment
that you are the jury. So weigh
this evidence.
W. E. Wilson, better known as
"Bill" Wilson, lived with his wife,
Jennie, and three children. They
were happy and contented. Then
another man entered the, home
and stole into the wife's heart.
Other Man Steals Love
The husband, later on, learned
that he had lost his wife's affec
tions and that the other man had
gained them
"I thought of the children the
home, and I still loved her," Wil
son testified. "So I took her away
from there, thinking that distance
might make a difference. But the
other man followed. They met
again ,and often. " Then I knew
that Jhere was nothing else to do.
I did that."
Now the evidence goes to show
that Wilson and his two older
children moved to Oneota, staying
with hi3 brother on a farm.. He
said nothing to neighbors about
his wife and the baby.
To him that was a closed chap
ter of life.
He did, however, go to the coun
ty se2t and file suit for divorce,
alleging desertion. Three years
afte rthe divorce was granted him
Wilson married another woman.
Find Bones Half Buried
Tv.o boys were roving the
woods near Oneonta. They came
upon two half-hidden skeletons,
one that of an adult, tha other of
a small child. Running to town
the boys told of their discovery,
and everybody flocked through the
wools.
Hurriedly the old citizens went
over the roll call of missing per
sons. "Murdered!" they cried in uni
son; "of course; if they hadn't
'been murdered they would have
been buried in th egrave yard."
And then they remembered that
Bill Wilson's first wife hadn't
been seen since the night in 1909
when she and the baby disappear
ed and Bill took the two other
children to his brother's home.
Suspicion widened and deepened.
VBII1 Wilson's honeymoon was
Interrupted by his. arrest on a
charge of wilfull and premeditat
ed murder.' That Was three years
after his first wife's disappear
ance. ' She went away," h esaid. "I
don't know where, I am sure' that
she went with her lover."
"Then why didn't you take thg
qther child?" he was asked.
"Because "she said it wasn't
pictures illustrating the tragic
,
Wilson, Sentenced to Life Im-
Slaying Charge ,
mine; that the other man was its
father."
Identify Skeletons
The trial proceeded. The boys
told-of the finding of the skele
tons. Doctors said they were
bones of a woman ' and a baby.
Folks who knew said the missing
wife and child were of the heights
indicated by the skeletons.
, Bill Wilson said he hadn't
heard of his first Wife and that
child since that night.
Folks insisted that it was im
possible for a woman and baby to
leave town without .being seen.
The prosecutor closed the case
with a brilliant plea for justice,
demanding punishment In its most
severe form for the murder of the
wife, and child.
"We, the jury find the defend
ant guilty of murder in the first
degree,!' and the judge sentenced
Bill Wilson to the penitentiary for
life."
Taken to Prison Cell
Appeals to higher courts failed
to change the course of law and
Bill Wilson was thrust into prison
stripes, an alternated from con
vict camps to life cell. That last
ed. 17 months. '. ..''
Then one day a relative of the
"other man," missing too, got a
letter from Jennie; thej missing
woman. Wilson's ; sister heard
about it, and finally- located Jen
nie at Britland,- Ind. The "mur
dered" woman hadn't heard that
Wilson was in prison for her
"death," She came back to One
onta and the machinery of the law
reserved itself, gradually and
slowly, ending with the release
from prison strides and cells of
Bill Wilson. The law also wiped
the "murder stain" from his name
and thought to square accounts
with him by handing him a few
paltry dollars.
But whil bearing the false
brand of Cain "Wilson" second wife
turned against him. She, too, be
lieved that he was a jnurdeTer,
the slayer of. his wife and baby.
She divorced him. i
That's the stor yof Bill WilBon.
convicted on the strongest case of
circumstantial evidence ever pre
sented 'to any American court.
There was absolutely no loophole
in the chain of testimony against
him. Jury, judge and supreme
court said so. ,
"Guilty beyond : a reasonable
doubt."

MEXICAN CONGRESS
ASKED BY CARRANZA
TO BUILD RAILROADS
Three Lines to Be Constructed
Under Plan, and One
Other Bought
WASHINGTON, April 3. President
Carranza has asked the extra session
of the Mexican congress which has
been called to meet May 1, to author
ize the construction by the federal
covernment ,of three (railroad lines
and the acquisition of another railway
system, it was learned today from
official sources. The tact that these
features were in the call for an ex
tra session was not sent out from
Mexioo City at the time the call was
made public.
The congress will be asked to ap
propriate 10,000,000 pesos for the pur
chase of all or a majority of the stock
of the Yucatan railway system owned
by the Hennequen association. One
of the new lines will link this system
with . the territory of Qutatana Roo,
which at present has no railroad. The
line will run from Peto, Yucatan, to
Bacalar in the southern part of the
territory and to Santa Cruz, the chief
harbo rof ,the. territoryon the east
This line was contemplated by Por
firio Diaz and surveys were made un
der his orders.. " "
Another line, the pian for which
also dates back to the Diaz adminis-j
tration, is proposed to run from San
ta Lucrecia, in the state of Vera Cruz,
on the Tehuantepec line purchased. a
short tim eago from the Pearson in
terests, to Campeche, where It will
connect with another branch of the
Yucatan system. This line will tra
verse a portion of the state of Chiapas
and all of the state of Tabasco.
The third proposed line will , run
from some point on the Southern Pa
cific of Mexico, between Magdalena
and Hermosillo to Ensenada, the cap
ital of Lower Calif ornTa, This' road
will enable Mexico to transport troops
by rail from vcentral Mexico to Lower
California without entering the Unit
ed States. ,
neretoiore wnen . an emergency
arose, wnicn- necessitated the quick
dispatch of troops to the western ter
ritory ,the Mexican government was
coixipeilea. to secure permission from
the United States to send its soldiers
throug hthis country; . The permission
has always', been granted, but ': it is
said the Mexicans always have dis
liked to make the request. . '
The railroad will also open up to
Mexico al lthe land of the Colorado
relt:i which heretofore has. been di
rectly tributary to the United States
because of the Acnerican railway.
These railroad projects are believed
by officials here to be a part of Presi
dent Carranzn's program to: secure
for the government the entire trans
portation machinery of Mexico. There
are, except for short mining , lines.
at present only two privately owned
railroads in Mexico. One is the
Southern Pacific of Mexico and the
other is the old line from Vera Crua
to Mexico City, which was 'built and
is : owned by 'a British company. The
government also has a line from the
capital to Vera Cruz".

the Saare valley and the region west '
of Rhine brought up this principle of
self-determination and it was not clear
that the transfer of territorial control
of these localities would be in accord
ance with the wishes and determina
tion of their populace.
King Albert pf Belgium figured
prominently during today's confer
ence. The Belgian monarch called on
Colonel House at 11 o'clock In the
morning and later eaw President Wil
son before the arrival of David Lloyu
George, Premier Clemenceau and
Signor Orlando. The call of King Al
bert on Colonel House was a decided
novelty for which veterans of royal
procedure Bald there was no prece
dent. The king wore the uniform of
commander in chief' of the Belgian
army and was accompanied by a staff s
officer. He was met at the entrance
of the residence of Colonel House Dy
the colonel himself, who escorted him
to bis private orfice, where a series,
of conferences constantly is going on.
It is understood that King Albert, j
drew attention during his talk with j
Colonel House to Belgium's vital In-1

which are reaching a culminating
stage and also spoke .of his interest

Colonel House after King Albert de- j

The Douglas Spirit
'Friendly rivalry between neighboring cities is a good thing. It helps
the industrial and financial progress of both cities. It gives citizens an
added incentive to boost their city and put forth their best efforts In
behalf of the locality which ithey call their home. The result is a quick
ened civic pride, the satisfaction of knowing that the city In which one
lives is the best that one can possibly make it. ,
But rhralry, If unfriendly, is not an asset. Rather It is a liability.
When it is Necessary to "knock" one place in order that another may be
boosted, the: process eracts to the detriment of both places.
We l ave in mind the action of a certain Douglas citizen, one "Tubby'
Morrison,' whose zeal for his home city seems to have caused him to for- i
getihe rights of others. Morrison is managing the exhibition baseball
game in Douglas April 13 between Douglas players and the Chicago Cubs.
Naturally he is anxious that the game prove a success.' Naturally he wants
the biggest possible crowd on hand to witness the game, otherwise he
stands to face a considerable financial loss, and Douglas will acquire a
reputation of being a poor town for enterprise of any kind. ,-'
Morrison, however, is pursuing "the wrong course in attempting to attract
a, crowd for his game. Reasoning, evidently, that Douglas fans would
not turn "out in sufficient number to make his venture a profitable one,
decided to appeal for 'the support of Warren District citizens. That is all
right, as far as it goes. Many who appreciate good baseball probably
had planned to attend the game In Douglas. There can be no possible
objection to that.
But Morrison, seeking attendance for his game in Douglas, carefully
overlodks the fact that the Chicago Cubs will play an exhibition game
here on Saturday, April 12, the day before the Douglas contest. He not
only has exercised great care to overlook the fact, but has gone to the
extent of peeling advertisements here announcing the Douglas game, tear
ing down announcements of the local game in order to find room for his
own posters, according to local fans. In addition to this, a number of
persons reported to the Review yesterday that Morrison spread the report
that the Cubs would not play in Bisbee, appearing only in Douglas, and
that in order to see the National League champions play it will be neces
sary to go to Douglas.
Such an action merits only the one kind of punishment that can make
an Impression on Morrison. That is for the Warren District fans who
were planning to visit Douglas for the game there to refrain from attend
ing the contest. That will hurt his pocketbook, usually the tenderest
spot In the makeup of men who will resort to methods he has followed
In an attempt for personal gain
.The Chiacgo Cubs WILL play in the Warren District, appearing here
Saturday, April 12. despite the rumors spread by the Douglas manager.
And, no doubt, the contest will be a success, efforts of Douglas folk to
make it a failure notwithstanding.
A Mkplaced Kindness
While the government has not thought enough of the subject to take
data, so there are no exact figures available, still we surmise that about
this time the year the great American boil and carbuncle crop is ripening
for the harvest.
The great American home feeds itself on buckwheat cakes, and rich
surplus, and pork sausage, and hot breads, and rich puddings end pies and
cakes through the inactive winter months, and then, just before house
cleaning time, dame nature has a small sweeping out and shoves a lot
of rubbish out through the skin.
Perhaps they are folks who will regard the annual boil visitation as
an infliction Jrom the Lord rather than from the pork barrel.'
And these ,?ood people would never believe that when spring comes,
and greens, boiled and otherwise, edge into the menu that th rash and
blisters and such vanish.
High toned folks, who really regard salads as something to eat,
and who can take olive oil without a drenching bit, escapes these spring
plagues, but the average American home, especially those in the rural
regions where three square meals a day still mean meat and lots of it,
and piles and heaps of sweet stuffs with tea well boiled, and offee
reboiled for a week with the same grounds for a substratum, prefers the
old-time menu, with a dish of sarsaparilla as a spring tonic.
Our pictures of home would not be complete without the one of dad
' taking his meals through the spring with a sofa cushion for his mooring
ground, and a full set of neck plasters for his earbunkles.
That was about the time we broke out like a turkey's egg, and
sister captured her first beau and box of face powder.
Lut on a zero morning, especially if you have valeted ten cows be
fore dawn, a stack of buckwheat cakes, with sorgum, and a heap of
home made sausage, with hot rolls and coffee that will float a nine
pound splitting wedge, provide something worth consideration.
Spring Is
Every time we read some touching appeal to be kind to the dear
birdies, and beseeching us to scatter crumbs for them upon the encrusted
wintry wastes we thing about the time we adopted an owL
He first visited us one cold morning when the air was full of snow. '
He stayed an hour or so and watched us chop wood, and then went on
about his business.
He a'ppeared to have business to attend to, and to be able to mind It
in the daytime as well.'
Every once in a while he would drop into th'e woodshed and loaf,
until ye fixed up a box for him, scattered table scraps every once in a
while, and held long monologues with him while he sat bunched up and
solemn, and occasionally snapped his sharp beak by way of polite assent.
We were getting to have a real affection for the thing, and had about
decided that their character had been much maligned by the Ignorant
when one morning we heard a terrific flapping and squawking outside.
We hurried forth and found a big excited hen at about her last gasp
in the deep snow, and clever Mr. Owl firmly attached to her neck and
chewing away for dear life.
We attended to his case first, and then we abek-tracked and found
where he had attacked the ben as she left the roost. That gave us a
bunch as to where our fat hens had been going to.
Our attentive friend had evidently called, chatted wtth us until we
went about our; chores, then had picked out a fat hen and made his
treacherous feast. . i
And no bigger than your two fists at that; the bloody blighter!
Since then we have scattered our winter crumbs and our friendship,
with greater discrimination, not say deliberation.
Determination Wins
There was a big parade, in an eastern town, in which were floats and
men from every section of the country.
California had an automobile beautifully made up to represent a "horn
of plenty." Everything went lovely until the engine got so hot it could
no longer go. For a few minutes it looked as though that float must
drop out, but the men wanted the convention for their state, so rather
than not be represented, they put their shoulders to the wheel and pushed
the" automobile for more than fifteen miles.
; Very few people standing along the street realized that the Cali
fornia float was to have had any ot-her power of locomotion than the
strength of the men.
California got the convention.
Grit and determination will ever win the admiration of any throng.
Everybody loves the men who can't be kept down..
And. the admiration is doubly strong if the sufferjng and hard
ships iwident to the effort are b orne with a smile.
That is -ne of the big reasons the Yanks are so popular in Europe.

WOMEN MEMBERS OF.
UTAH LEGISLATURE
WIN MUCH" SUCCESS
t
Four of Gentler Sex Occupy
Seats, and Put Forward
Many Bills
SALT LAKE CITY. Utah, April 3.
Women members of the Utah legisla
ture had much success with meas
ures mey were, iu au eiicui i cojiuiio-1
ible for, at the Thirteenth biennial
legislature, recently adjourned, indi
vidually, however, their bills did not
fare weih As members of commit
tees on health and education the work
of the women legislators" at the most
recent session may be considered suc
cessful. .
Four women occupied seats in the
session just passed. Mrs. Elizabeth,
Hayward of Salt Lake was a member (
of the senate.. The other three, Mrs.
Delora Wilkins Blakely, Mrs. Anna T.
Piercey and Dr. Grace-Stratton Alrey,
were members of the house of rep
resentatives. Women in the Utah
legislature are not a novelty, how-
ever, for Utah has long been a sufJ
frage state and the women have had!
representation ever since suffrage;
was granted.
Mrs. Hayward introduced a hum-1
ber of bills in the senate, but the
measure upon which she worked con
stantly providing an eight hour day
for women was killed during the
session. She was successful In hav
ing passed and signed by the gover
nor, however, a bill placing the mat
ter of the employment of children
under the state industrial commis-,
sion instead of the juvenile court. Mrs.i
Hayward also was responsible for a.
joint resolution authorizing the gov-
ernor to appoint a committee to con
sider a suitable memorial' to te pre
sented to Utah's soldiers and sailors.
The resolution memoralizing congress
to pass the Susan B. Anthony suffrage
amendment to the national consti
tution, which was passed, was offered
by Mrs. Hayward.
Mrs. Plercey's principal bill, provid
ing, for a minimum wage for women
and minors, met defeat. A measure
providing for hours of employment of
women in certain classes of work, be:
came a law, however, and credit for
this measure is due to Mrs. Piercey.
A similar measure introduced in the
Benate by Mrs. Hayward, was lost be
cause, it was said, it was too general
in its terms. Mrs. Piercey also was
responsible for a measure for theben
efit of returned soldiers and sailors
a memorial to congress asking that
necessary steps be taken to retain the
preferential right of soldiers-and sail
ors on the list of eligibles in the civil
service list. .
Mrs. D. W. Blakely, another mem
ber of the lower house,-was the au
thor of several blls, two of the im
portant ones being killed. A meas
ure providing for support of widowed
dependent mothers, of which she w as
the author, became law, however.
Dr. Airey, whq has served in form
er legislatures, wa3 prominent in com
mittee work, but bills of which she
was the author did not fare wall, three
more or less important measures of
hers being killed, one through an
error, a clerk failing to include the
enacting clause when engrossing the
bill, which had been passed. It pro
vided for the establishment of a home
for fallen women.

TWO INDIAN POLICE
AND CAPTIVES RISK
LIVES TCREAGH JAIL
While Posse Searched for
Murderers, They Were
Swimming Colorado
FLAGSTAFF, Ariz., .April . 3. Two
Indian policemen and thei rtwo pris
oners, the pair of Navajos wanted in
connection with the murder or Charles
Hubbell at Oraiba,' March. 23, were
takln gtheir lives in their hands, swim
ming the swollen Little Colorado
river opposite Leupp lat night, while
the sheriffs of two counties were or
ganizing a powerful posse at Winslow
to go on the trail of the alleged mur
derers. This was the latest advice re
ceived here tonight from Leupp, where
the Navajos are in jail. j
The Indian officers took their men
by surprise across the Colorado and
the four were forced to swim the dan
gerous torrent to reach the jail.
Today Stephen Janus, superinten
dent of the Indian school at Leupp, 34
miles east of this place, refused to
turn the two Navajos over to the coun
ty officers until it is decided where
the case will come under the jurisdic
tion of the county or the government.
So far it' has not been decided
whether the killing of Hubbell took
place on an Indian reservation or on
state land. Janus was determined in
hsi stand to hold the men till the
jurisdiction problem is solved and the
county officers returned to Winslow
thfs evening without their prisoners.
The young Indian, who is said to
have done the shooting, Is 22 years
old. His brother, who was with him,
but is declared to be innocent of any
part in the affair, is 18.
Their edpture occurred at -9 o'clock
laBt night, 13. hours Lerore the impos
ing sheriffs posse of 17 armed men
In four automobiles left Winslow for
a battle to the death with the pair in
their cave in the mountains.

could tot recall a single instance in
which he had received a helpful sug

"but claimed them as his own after
he had been driven to their adoption."

"that I could hardly eat a thing and
nothing tasted right. The little I

REVIEW WANT ACS

"I'll Get 'Em," Shouted Poughboy as He Dashed for Ger
mans, Keeps Up Attack After He Is Wounded
NOTE: General Pershing was '
asked by the war department to
tell the ten most heroic feats of
tha war. He sent a list of 100,
from which the general staff pick
ed the best ten. All ten stories
will be published by the Review,
this being the second of the se
ries: (N. E. A. Washington Bureau, 1128

Private . George Dilboy of Boston,
a member of Company H, 103d infan
try was one of the heroes of the Marne
who gave his life for his country in
the start of the great allied offensive
that won the war.
His regiment was part of the Twenty-sixth
division which ' took partin
che great drive through , Belleau wood,
which, began on July 18. On the first
cay of the fight Private Dilboy made
a name for himself that will live In
American history. '
A railroad embankment along a lit
tle stream near the town of Belleau
j was the objective of Dilboy's platoon, j
I You remember how .overwhelmingly,
I the donghboys carried everything be--
, oire theia. Dilboy s platoon reached
I the embankment, and" th.ere halted.
I Young Dilboy was selected by his
j platoon leader to accompany him on a
reconnortenng expedition over the
fround beyond the railroad. They
climbed the embankment, but no soon
er had their heads appeared over the
top than a German machine gun post-
j fed 100 yards away opened up on
i them. ,
Yelling defiance at the Huns, Dil
i boy stood upon the railroad track,
' exposed to the view of the Germans,
and opened fire on them with his
j rifle, while the bullets rang against
the rails beneath his feet.
- Apparently, however, his, fire had
no effect on the Hun machine gun
crew.
"I'll get 'em, Sergeant," he yelled to
his platoon commander, and, with his
bayonet fixed, paying no more atten
tion to the bullets flying about him
than as if they were hailstones, he
rushed down the embankment and
charged ahead through a wheat field
toward the gun emplacement. .
For 75 yards Dilboy dashed ahead
unhurt. Then a piece of shrapnel
struck him in the right leg just above
the knee, nearly severing the leg.
At the same time several bullets
lodged in various parts of the body.

Lying there in the wheat field, the

Castro Scoffs at Union of Two
Rebel Leaders; Says Villa
Is Stronger
JUAREZ, Mex., April. 3. Francisco
Villa has much more force and cour
age than has Felix Diaz or Aureliano
Blanquet, General Jesus Augusfin
Castro, sub-secretary ' of war in the
Carranra cabinet, declared here to
night soon after hi sarnval from Chi
huahua City to inspect '1000 cavalry
horses his agents recently bought from
the United States army for use in
pursuing Villa.
"If the desperate ex-federals wish
to join a man with fofce and courage
they should join the leader of the Co
lumbus, N. M., raid Francisco Villa
for he has more of these qualities
than either Diaz or Blanquet." Gen
eral Castro said npon being shown .the
Associated Press dispatch from New
York saying General JManquet had
joined Diaz in the state of Vera Cruz.
. Shown the paragraph in the dis
patch in which General Blanquet is
quoted as saying he would meet his
friend's 'in Mexico or In eternity,"
General Castro, with a laugh, pointed
to the sky and said: "He will keep
that engagement in eternity."
Asked if General Blanquet would
lend any" strength to the Diaz move
ment against the Carranza government
General Castro said:
"I believe, and I have been in a po
sition to observe, that these men
who could do (nothing when they had
all the elements of war at their com
mand, can certainly do nothing with
a few elements and a small following.
The people of Mexico have not for
gotten the wrongs done them when
they were in control and I am sure
these leaders are not, and never will
be dangerous."
General Castro said Felix Diaz has
10 or 12 old federal commanders un
der him, each having bands of from
25 to 100 men. Diaz, he added, never
had more than 100 unless some of
these separate leaders joined him. He
said they frequently quarreled among
themselves and Higlno Aguilar was
always quarreling with Diaz or aome
other leader. He said he does not
think Felipe Angeles, now with Villa,
has any connection wit bthe Diaz
Blanquet movement as all are afraid
of any one associated with the Villa
forces because of the feeling against
Villa in the United States.

BY WAR DEPARTMENT
Machines Obsolete From
Standpoint of War to Be
Disposed Of
WASHINGTON, April 3. The war
department announced today that a
contract had been signed with the
Curtiss Airplane & Motor corporation
of uBffalo, N. Y., for the sale of 4G0S
Curtiss OX-5 motors, 1616 JN-4 planes,
without motors, and 1100 standard
planes without motors. The contract
calls for the payment of $2,720,000 for
this property which, the war depart
ment announced, frpm the-standpoint
of use by the army is obsolete and
worn out.
The OX-5 motor is of the eight cylin
der type used extensively in training:
Most of these motors have been used
to such an extent that they would have
to be entirely rebuilt. The JN-4
planes were the machines used in ele
mentary training and are now in such
condition that much overhauling and
!n most instances rebuilding would be
required before they could be used
further. The standard plane had been

war department, manufacturers of this
material were requested to submit
bids, and the best offer received was
that of the Curtiss company.

BERLIN, Wednesday, AprU 2. (By
the Associated Press.) The strikes at
Stuttgart and in the Ruhr district
seems to have been checked by the
energetic action of the government by
the prompt use of troops, martial law
and other salutary means.
Official reports from Stuttgart,
summarizing the situation there, say
that serious violence is Teported only
from Esslingen, where the Sparta
cans seized weapons and automobiles,
but surrendered them after negotia
tor. The large number o fnon-resi-dents
among the strikes was one of
the features of uprising, going to
prove that the movement was, as
claimed, purely a political effort of the
radicals and independents to over
throw the governments.
The strikers at Stuttgart assembled
frequently yesterday, despite the mar
tial law regulations, but were dis
persed. The Readers were arrested
by the toops, and the government
was master of the situation, by night
fall. The troops behaved splendidly.
Lthough some of them received rough
treatment.

cotton from the United States.
PARIS, April 3. (By the Associat
ed Press.) The departure t)f General
Jan Christian Smuts, member of the
British league of nations commission,
for Budapest, instead of General Mam
gin of the French army, who was first
suggested as the allied representative
to Investigate certain problems in
Hungary arising from the armistice,
is regarded as an indication that talk
ing, rather than fighting, will take
place in Hungary, where the situation
is believed by the allied officials ta
have improved greatly.
Advioes to the French foreign of
fice indicate tha the forces in Ukraine
under Petlura are within 30 miles of
Kiex, threatening the recapture of the
citv from the bolshevik!.
The Rumanian victory over the bol
shevik! on the P.essaratian bordert
and the fact that Odessa i3 being re
victualled and is not being evacuated
by the allies, lessen the chance for a
boleheviki union with the extremists
of Hungary, who are evincing a
nounced inclination for good relations
with the entente.
LONDON, April 3 The house of
commons debated the Irish question
this evening, liberal members endeav
oring to elicit some indication of the
government's policy. The most no
table pohit in the debate was reached
when Sir Edward Carson urged a post
ponement of the question until the end
of the war and declared that at pres
ent he regarded the question of recon
struction in Ireland, with education,
health, housing and similar matters as
far more important than "the raising
of old controversies over home rule."
Joseph Devlin, a nationalist leader
said he thought Sir Edward's speech
was "the most powerful indictment of
British rule in Ireland," Capt. William
Archer Redmond, of Waterford, said:
"Ireland is almost on the verge of
a revolution and the government is
responsible. Let the government say
frankly whether it intends to repeal
the home rule act." '

TALK ENGLISH, PARIS
TELLS U. S. SOLDIERS
PARIS, April 3. "English Spoken"
is the sign on about every other store
window in Paris. Most places it means
they understand "yes", and "no" and
are able to say "good-day" and "good
bye." Result, some of the stores now
advertise: "English Spoken .by an
.English Lady." And there are restau
rants .with signs like- this: "Amer
icans are respectfully requested to ad
dress the waiters in English as their
French is not generally understood." ,'
"Last year I pin-chased a standard
make of shoes, and in sixty days the
soles were worn through; I had them
re-soled with Neolin Soles which
lasted me six months in the same
service that wore out the other soles
in two," writes E. A. Lancaster of
Lancaster & Company,, jewelers,
Greeneville, Tenn.
Mr. Lancaster's experience with
Neolin Soles is not unusual. Millions
of people can testify to their long wear
and economy. To reduce your shoe
expense, buy Neolin-soled shoes. You
can get them in many styles for every
member of the family.
Neolin Soles are created by Science
to be comfortable and waterproof as
well as long wearing. Good repair
shops carry them. .They are made
by The Goodyear Tire & Rubber Co.,
Akron, Ohio, who also make Wingfoot
Heels guaranteed to outwear all
other heels.

BY REVIEW
NEW YORK, April 2. Eliminating
the familiar methods of acceleration
employed by pools and associated pro
fessional interests, trading in stocks
today was featureless, the demand for
high grade shares showing also steady
diminution.
Conservative interests weer again
restrained by th econfusing character
of Paris advices and the refusal of Di -
rector General Hlnes of the railroad
administration to accept th eschedule
of steel prices fixed by the industrial
board.
United States Steel was forced
down to 97 and witn otner indus
trials, shippings", oils "and specialties
regifcflered extreme revesals of two to
four points, the market finishing with
a heavy undertone.
MLeials weer among the few excep
tions to the reactionary trend. Sales
amounted to 825,000 shares.
Sound, investment conditions were
indicated by the keen inquiry for war
finance bonds, but this demand found
no reflection "in the general market
for high class securities.
Liberty bonds were firmer, foreign
issues continued to ase and changes
in domestic rails and industrials were
narrow. Total sales, . par value, ag
gregated $14,750,000. Old United

Owing to the irregularity which
chacarterized the numerous price

as though many traders were trying

P. Disque, just prior to his relinquish
ment o fthe division ana resigning as
president of the Spruce Production
corporation. General Disque tells in
detail o fthe development and organ
ization of the division which was to
increase the monthly production of
material from 3.000,000 to 10,000,000
feet at once. The principal reasons
for forming the corporation, as given
by General Disque, were:
First About 65 per cent of the pro
duction of aircraft lumber was allo
cated t oGreat Mritain, France and
Italy and it seeme donly equitable that
they should bear that patr of the ex
pense necessary to build the mills and
railroads required.
Second We were actually carrying
on a great industrial enterprise and
required the freedom of action usually
found in a business concern and al
most impossible under war department
regulations.
We provided in this way for our
allies to assist i nthe capital expendi
tures before they were made rather
than doing it . after development,
through paying for lumber, the sales
price of "which, included amortization
cf capital expenditures on a basis of
ccmpleta amortization in ten months
after completion. '
Because of the Importance of the
lumber industry in the Pacific North
west there has been a great volume
cf .discussion regarding the. operations
and costs of this organization.' Most
cf it .has come from people totally
ignorant of our problems, method, or
other facts.
It is appropriate, therefore, to refer
to the quantity of production and cost
of same in this summary. The ac
countants of this organization have
had instructions from the beginning
to include in their cost accounting,
every legitimate item and that meant
rent, stationery, , telephone, officers'
and soldiers' pay and subsistence, as
well as transportation and purchase
of all stumpage, materials, equipment
and rights of way and hire of labor.
The entire expeditures of the Sig
nal Corps, U. S. Army.i Spruce Pro
duction Division and the U .S. Spruce
Production corporation; from the be
ginning of operations to, "and includ
ing, April-1, will not fcxeead $45s500,
000. The total footage of aircraft lum
ber produced, shipped and paid for by
the Signal Corps, Spruce Production
division and U. S. Spruce Production
corporation was 143,000,000 feet.
Therefore, if we assume that the
corporation has no assets whatever,
the 143,000,000 feet of aircraft lumber
cost $318 per M. and such a price con
templates a complete amortization of
every capital expenditure and expense
item involved in our operations.
However .the corporation ;has on
hand today tangible and salable -assets,
which .estimated at approximate
ly 40 per cent of their cost, are worth
58,000,000. Deducting this $8,000,000
from the total expenditure of 45.500,
000 we have an expenditure of $37,-

isfoee
AsfteQXsssansrjccs
500.000 for the 143,000,000 feet, at a
resulting cost per thousand of $262.
To date the corporation has sold
approximately $2,000,000 cf these as
sets and has averaged near 80 per
cent of their cost price. Therefore,
it would appear that my estimate of
$S,000,000 worth of assets which Is ap
proximately 40 per cent of the cost
price, would be very conservative.
In all of our operations it has been
provided that the Allied governments
s!hall participate in the dead loss
which will finally result due to depre
ciation in value of assets, in propor
tions to the amount of aircraft lumber
supplied to them. Based on my esti
mate of and salvage of 40 per cent
of the cost value of our assets .there
will be a dead loss of $12,000,000, due
to the operations of the Signal Corps,
Spruce Production Division and the
United States Spruce Production cor
poration, and thi3 loss will be dis-
! tributed:
Thirty-four per cent of $4,100,000 to
the United States.
Thirty-one per cent, or $3,800,000, to
Great Britainl
Twenty-four per cent, or $2,900,000,
to France. ' -
Ten per cent, or $1,200,000, to Italy.
Of course, this loss must be consid

Lashes Have Much to Do
With Appearance of Face,
Says Edith Hyde
By Edith Hyde
"The .Girl of the Golden Apple"
The eyebrows have almost a3
much to do with the . appearance
cf the face as the eyes them
selves. Beautiful eyebrows help
to make beautiful eyes more
beautiful, and eyes are "the win
dows of the soul."
For the woman whose eye-
brows are' falling out, or are too
thin, a solution composed of 10
grammes of 80 per cent alcohol,
100 grammes of horacic acid
water, and 10 drops of essence of
violet may be used with good ef
fect. If you have greasy eyebrows, a
good lotion is made from 100
grammes of rose water, 12
grammes of acetic acid and 12
grammes of tincture of can
vtharidis, ' to which should be
added 25 grammes of essence of
violet.
For the woman wLo has good,
well-shaped eyebrows, the eye
brow pencil should be banned.
Nothing is worse than to see eye
brows with a thick paste of black
pencil upon them. In case the eye
brows are too thin," or are too
light in color, or are not well
shaped, the discriminating wom
an can carefully apply a pencil
so that her appearnce will De
greatly improved. Great care
should be taken, however, not to
make the application of the pen
cil conspicuous or even obvious
Beauty cannot be obtained whole
sale. It is the care in little things
that make it possible. .
Money means nothing, for money 13
not to be taken with you when you
pass from this wor!l to the great un
known beyond. Money cannot make
you happy, nor -can it give you the
feelings of gratification as the letter
below quoted can give. There are
millions of things that money can buy,
but a source of satisfaction such as
the one this letter has produced can
not be procured by money. Read:

ican steamer West Ekonk arrived here
today from Gibraltar with the captain
and crew of nine men of the Spanisn

The Campeador was leaking badly
when the West Ekonk picked her up
and throwing her a hawser attemptec
