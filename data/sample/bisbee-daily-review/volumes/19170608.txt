FOOD NEEDS
OF ALLIES
ARE-GREAT
United States Must Eeat Less
Wheat And Meat In Order
Thai: Allies May Be Sup
plied, Says Hoover.
By Review Leased Wire).
WASHINGTON. June ?. Herbert
W
C. Hoover's report to the gov
ernment on what the United
States must do to sustain its al
lies with food, made public today,
shows that the allies and a few neu
trals which must be considered re
quire during the next year a billion
bushels tf cereals alone and that their
needs of meats, fats and sugar also
will be enormous.
"We are at war," he says. "We must
do what success in war demands. He
also fight who helps a fighter fight
That Is the way we can all help in
the war, and If we don't help the war
-will not be won."
The situation abroad was outlined
by Mr. Hoover as follows:
"Great Britain nominally raises
about one-rourth of the grain she needs
for her bread, France about one-half.
The additions necessary to make up
the full quantity needed are brought
in from various countries. But in
these abnormal times the native pro
duction of the fighting allies is greatly
reduced by the withdrawal of man
power from the farms to the armies
and munitions factories; also by rea
son of late frosts this year's crops in
the United Kingdom, France and
Italy is a partial failure.
Imports Lacking.
"Opportunity to import from certain I
grain raising countries, such as Kussia
and Rumania, Is entirely lacking, and
from certain others, such as Australia,
South America and India, is greatly
lessened on .account of the long haul,
for which ships cann'Jt bs spared. ;
"In addition, the actual cereal and
meat consumption of the allied coun
tries Is increased by the transfer of
millions of mn from sedentary occu
pations to those of great personal ac
tivity and by the wastage incidental
to the feeding of the great armies in
the field. There must also be recog
nized the greater demand for seed
grain to maintain the dairy and meat
iinniioa onrl th horses of the armies."
ewpf ... - t
America's duty is set forth by Mr.1
Hoover thus:
America Must Help.
"All those conditions throw on North
America the brunt of the burden of
supplying our co-belligerents with the
human and animal food necessary to
maintain their great armies in fight
ing condition, as well as to keep alive
and efficient the families of the fight
ers and the great industrial army at
home.
"The requirements in cereals alone
for the next year, of the allies, and the
few neutrals whose needs must be
given some consideration, are a billion
bushels. The needs of meats. faU and
uiirar also are enormous. Native pro
duction and imports from other coun
tries can meet but a part of these re
quirements; what is left must come
from U3; yet this amount Is far be
yond any surplus that we shall have If
we try to maintain our normal con
sumption. Urge Conservation.
"Our wheat prospects for this year
are not encouraging. A reasonable
forecast would indicate a crop of be
tween 650.000,000 and 700,000.000 bush
els. We have never exported more
thnn 500.000.000 bushels of cereals in a
year, yet the needs abroad are for
twice that.
"he moral is clear, our consumption
must be reduced. This can be done,
first, by elimination of waste: recond,
by the substituting for the kinds tof
food needed by the allies of food not
so needed, but which we can Just as
well use, as corn for wheat, poultry
and eggs for red meat, and so on, ln-
voluntarily restricting ourselves to
sufficient and sensible ration.

the Germans. ' ,
Over a front of more than nine miles, extending from
the region of Ypres southward nearly to Arrnentieres, the Brit
ish started their drive Thursday morning and at nightfall had
everywhere advanced their line, capturing villages and num
erous points of vantage, among the latter the Messines-Wyts-chaete
ridge, which commands the surrounding plains - for
miles and which for two and a half years had -been a trouble

The villages of Messines vand Wytschaete fell into the

With consternation reigning among

Germans offered only slight resistance
and everywhere were beaten off. even

which the French troops repulsed.
Ill MS
From a Staff Correspondent of The
Associated Press In France with the
British Armies, Jane 7, (Via London)
The British armies struck today on
a new front and won a victory which
supplements the successes at Arras
during the last two months. The Ger
mans though apparently aware that
the blow was coming and seemingly
prepared to meet it, were driven from
their nearly three years hold on Mes
sines ridge, opposite "Poor Old" Ypres
the last remnant of an important Bel
gian town, which with the help of the
French and British in turn has held
out against all the massed attacks the
Germans could fling against It Includ
ing the first great surprise of poison
gas as a means of supposed civilized
warfare.
Ypres in a sense was avenged to
day, for Messines ridge has been the
vantage point from which the Ger
mans have poured torrents of shells
Into the stricken city. The British
also wiped off an ofd score against the
Germans, for they held the ridge in
October, 1914. and with very thin forc
es and virtually no artillery fought
bloodily but vainly to hold it when
the Prussian troops massed their mod
ern and over-powering weapon of war
against it.
Heavy Bombardment
Today's attack lacked many of the
elements of surprise which attended
the battle of Arras and the successful
storming of Vlmy ridge. There has
been no doubt for three weeka past

council of defense, three leaders or a
Russian religious colony all of whose
members except twenty refused to
egister on Tuesday for the selective
draft, decided that the rest would not
register and would take the punish

They said In reply to the council of

terms of the army act and of the con
sequences, they were aware, too, of
their right to the claim of exemption
as conscientious objectors and they
knew they would not be called upon to
bear arms. But they said that they
believed to go through the form or
registration would be to "condone"
war.
Moreover, the leaders said that the
Holy Ghost as long as two years ago
had told them that there would be a
registration for war and ha J order d
them not to register. The council of
defense at the conclusion of the con

t
Returns On Registration Are
Slow In Reaching Washington;
Estimates May Have Been H igh
(By Review'Leaaed Wire). i tration should not be taken as indicat
WASHINGTON, June 7.- Reglstra- j tng a great nntnber of evasions. AU
tion returns came in slowly today and reports from department of justice
tonight, from Tuesday's great military
census, preventing anything approach
ing a. conclusive estimate as to the
number of men actually enrolled. An
official statement today, however, said
such partial .returns as were at hand
estimated that the 10,200,000 estimate
of the census bureau for the number
of men within the prescribed ages
w'juld not be equalled.
A feature of the few complete re
turns is the high percentage of the in-!
dicated exemption average, of approxi- j
mately 50 per cent of the total regis
tration. - Officials pointed but, howev
er, that this did not mean "actual ex
emptions, as the indicated figures in
clude all married men and those in ac
tive, judicial or " government offices.
Until exemption regulations have been
promulgated it will be impossible to
say bow many of these will be includ
ed in those to be marked off the mili
tary rolls. '
Millions Are Ready.
The one conclusive result of the reg
ulation that cannot be altered in the
slightest degree ry any possible vari
ation from the estimates is that niil
. lions of young Americana have put in
their "names, claiming no exemption
and stating no reason for release from
war service. '
In regard to the married men. Secre
tary Baker said today that in all the
letters he has received, on the subject
'of exemption, not one, even suggested
that marriage should establish a claf
exemption. He added that individual
cases would be dealt with on their
mentis, no matter what the reason for
exemption might be. I
Baker Enthusiastic
The secretary was enthusiastic over
the results of th registration. He has
expressed his appreciation of the'work
done by Provost . Marshal General
"Crowder and by state and municipal
'officials, declaring the day had een
a "spectacular demonstration" of the
solidarity of the American people and
of their high patrioasm, of which the
enrollment was the best evidence.
Mr. Baker thinks it will be some
time before the regulations governing
exemptions are issued.
The complete working out of these
regulations and the appointment of ex
emption boards, the secretary said, will
precede the issuance of regulations to
govern the selection of men for exam
ination. He had no comment to make
on the selection process beyond the
statement that a fair system would be
adopted. - , - . '
, Evasions Are Few.
Exemption boards will be localized
as much as possible to make it easy
for selected men to get to the place
of examination without interfering any
more than Is absolutely necessary with
their regular occupations. .
Officials generally said tonight the
fact that the few states which had sent
in their complete figures at a late hour
showed, with two exceptions falling otf ;

trary, to show that there was a sur
prisingly small number of skulkers.
Total figures from seven states and
the District of Columbia which were
reported when the provost marshal
general's office closed tonight showed
approximately 32,500 below the census
ratio. Should that average hold lor all
the states it would mean a total de
crease of about 200,000. The army
navy, marine corps and the national
guard, included in the population fig-
ures upon which the census estimates
were based, would more than offset
the" decrease.
Is After Slackers.
Representative Park, of Georgia,
sought further legal measures, today
to deal with slackers. In a bill in
troduced in the house he proposed
that men who failed to register be dis
franchised for the duration of the war.
Additional requests for registration
cards were received today from sev
eral bounties and the shipments were
made promptly.
Provost Marshal General Crowder
issued this statement otday:
"Some published press reports are
to the effect that, figures received in
the office of the provost marshal gen
eral indicate millions of claims for ex
emptions. These reports consist of
conclusions erroneously drawn and
very unjust to the young men of the
country, As a matter of fact no
claims whatever have- been called for
or received."

DARING HOLD-UP
TAKES PLACE III
DOUGLAS HOTEL
Two Masked Men Enter Room
During Gambling Game,
Rob Players And Escape;
Suspects Nabbed.
(Special Dispatch to Review.)
DOUGLAS, June 7. As the result of j
a holdup at midnight last night of the i
,1
occupants of a room over the
Mer-'
chants' pool ball. 836 G avenue, where i
it is alleged a gambling game was con-!
ducted, Jesse Gardner, aged 21, and j
B. A. Banta, aged 23, are prisoners in
the city jail today with a charge of j
robbery against them, and the peni-l
tentiary staring them in the 1'ace.
They are employes of the C. & A. sniel-'
ter.

robbed the place secured is not defi
nitely known, though the most reliable

leaving the place one of the robbers
fled on a motorcycle and Jn his haste
lost a Toll of bills containing $90. He
was not aware of the loss until the
man who bad been robbed told him of
it later. Then he said that in his baste
he might have lost the bills. Deputy ,
Sheriff Charles E. Cross searched the
road between here and Pirtleville at
daylight this morning and found the
money lying in the road.
Wore Masks.
The robbers wore masks made from
big blue handkerchiefs in comm'on use :
among laborers.. Each was armed and
when they entered the place they com
manded the inmates, half a dozen or
more men, to throw up their hands.
All complied and the robbers made a
hurried search of their pockets. They
secured $90 from one man and amounts
ranging from $10 to $25 from others.
One man had $10 tor $15 in his pock
et and a purse containing $80 in bills.
The robbers took both, but when the
man asked that his pocketbook be re
turned to him, as it had bis name on it
and was of no use to anybody else, the
robbers returned it without looking in
side. Another men, for whVim the
cards evidently hadn't turned right.
had only 15 cents in his pockets and
the holdup men refused to take that
Notify Cross.
It is said that some of the men
robbed thought they recognized Gard
ner and Banta as the robbers. They
"vailed up Deputy Sheriff Charles E.
Cross and he went to the room of the
! young men, abVmt three-quarters of a
mile west of town. Here, it is said, the
officer found all the money stolen in j
the holdup except the $90 which bad
been lost, and also small pieces of
blue goods cut from the handkerchiefs
to make slits for the robbers to see
through. The two men were then
placed under arrest.
It is said that 'one ofthem had lost
$10 or $50 yesterday a Iter noon at the
i place they are alleged to have robbed
I last night, and that his idea was to get
! his money back and as much more as
! possible. The' other young man is
1 reported to never have Rambled and
to have gone into the affair because
! of the large returns it offered. The
! supposition is that the lAMdup men ex
j pected to find a bi game in full prog-'
' ress and to get away with the bank
j roll. Apparently gambling had been in
- progress or was about to be started.
How the bank roll of the men who
! cenduct the game managed to escape
I the robbers is not known, though it
is said it Would have materially in
creased the receipts had it been in cvi
1 dence.

Other Officials. i
. (By Review Leased Wire.)
WASHINGTON, June 7. Differ-
i ences over the government's wooden
shipbuilding program came to a head
tonight when F. A. Eustis, assistant
general manager of the Emergency
j Fleet corporation, and his assistant, F.
H. Huntington Clark, issued state
ments virtually charging Mai. Gen.
Goethals, general manager of the cor
' poration, with halting building of the
. vessels by prescribing an impossible
; form of contract.
; The statements reveal that the fleet
; corporation has just received offers
from ten firms tc build 646 wooden
' ships within twelve months, or 786 I
i within eighteen months. General Goe
thals has turned the shipbuilders down !
tecause the builders wish to construct j
the ships on a cot plus 10 per cent j
, profit basis instead of contracting for !
. a flat price for the ships. j
Goethals Favors Steel. j
Eustis and Clark are the engineers !
: who originated the wood shipbuilding '
! nlan. I
; After taking charge of the building
' program General Goethals turned to !
steel construction and limited the j
wooden pi'ograni to not more than 250 j
ships in eighteen months. Eustis and !
Clark contend their corporation 'can :
build 2,00 0 wooden ships within that
' time without interfering with steel
building. ;
General Goethals could not be seen '
tonight for comment on the state
ments, i
I Chairman Dennian, of the board,
i who has been represented as 'opposing
General Goethals' plans to restrict i
00,lcn snipnuiiaing, saia:
"-Nne of the members of the ship-1

i 'JOCKEY OF DEATH,'
DARE-DEVIL FILM,
AT THE JEAGLE TODAY
One Scene Shows Hero And
Heroine ' Sliding Down a
Thousand Foot Cable From
Mountain Top.
"The Jockey of Death" will be
shown at the Eagle theater this after
noon and tonight.
Few ni'oving pictures contain as
i many "thrills" as "The Jockey of
Death," the first of the Adventure Se
ries to be released by the Internation
al. Dare-devil and breath-taking cir
cus acts follow each other in quick
succession from beginning to end of
the five full reels. The two principal
parts in the screen drama are taken
by Mile. Evelyn and M. Arturo, the
famous stars of Busch's circus, known
as the Barnum & Bailey of all Europe.
One of the m'ost remarkable of these
stunts is a slide down a wire cable
from the top of a mountain to the bot
tom without safeguards of any kind.
The cable was stretched by a fuel com
pany to convey the firewood cut on
the mountain top to the valley. The
! hero and heroine of the story, closely
pressed by their pursuers, seize a bun
dle of -faggots lying ready to be sent
below, hang it to the cable, and cling'
ing to the bundle, one on each side,
dash down at terrific speed 1,000 feet
or more. Every foot of the daring slide
i ! is clearly shown, even to the terrific
tumble the two performers receive at
the end of the cable along with the
bundle of faggots.
The cable slide is a real thriller, but
it !; or;:y one cf a score depicted by
these during performers in the great
photoplay of circus life, "The Jockey
it Death."

GERMAN GOLD IN ARIZONA.
Sunday evening; at a Globe mass meeting, the Rev.
P. M. Johnson, of that city, charged George D. Smith
secretary of the miners union of Globe, with being a
German agent, paid by Teuton gold for disrupting work
ers in that mining district The minister's remarks were
inspired by a circular which had fallen into his hands.
The minister dared Smith to take the platform with him,
on the following evening, and defend his stand before
the people.
Whether or not the Globe divine was correct in his
statement about Sm th. it seems certain that German
propaganda is still rampant in the State of Arizona.
Globe has been the scene of much trouble of this char
acter and the secretary of the miners' union there, has
been its avowed leader. Conscientious scriples, eta, etc.,
can have little weight with the American workingman in
the face of the declaration of Secretary of Labor W. B.
Wilson, Samuel Gompers and other labor leaders in the
United States. It would seem that Mr. Johnson's con
clusions may not only be possible but probable. Sane,
anyhtical reasoning would indicate such a state of
affairs.
Many of such men would have the country degenerate
into a second Russia; where all Is chaos and the end is
problematical. They forget our grievances or are being
paid to overlook them. In any case they would appear
to be disloyal in the extreme. Russia is having her
troubles with German influence, started months ago, but
now in full swing. On this subject, the New York World
pertinently, remarks:
"In spite of these treacheries, which are only repeti
tions of our own recent experience, there are Americans
under German influence who are asking even now why
we are at war and what we hope to gain by war. Bel
gium, Serbia and Armenia have been forgotten. The
perfidious disregard of treaties has been frogotten. The
massacres of the sea hare been forgotten. The lawless
challenge to us and to the whole world forbidding foreign
commerce except upon condtiions denying national sov
ereignty and right has been- forgotten. Militarism's
broken pledges, its disregard of every humane considera
tion that stood in its way, its avowed purpose to reduce
the earth to subjection, enforcing itshideous conceptions
of Kultur especially upon weak democracies all these
have been forgotten by every man foolish enough or per
verse enough to ask the questions which Potsdam and its
agents put into his mouth."
which applies in the bootlegging business. Besides
speedy automobiles, daring drivers, dark night and ample
danger, the runners of liquor are now resorting to every
conceivable trick to get their wares Into the populous
cities of the state.
It is said that the first recourse to false gasoline tanks,
false bottoms, running boards, enlarged horns, solid ex
tra tires, false seat upholstery and other tricks, was
made to get Into where it is a capital offense to sell
liquor. Several bootleggers have been arrested recently
with new "wrinkles" and the officers find it necessary,
at the present time, to Investigate even the slightest part
of a machine when Its owner or driver is suspected of
bootlegging. . .
Soon the sound of the horn will become suspicious and
the bootleggers win begin using aeroplanes or land sub
marines. In the meantime, however, It is probable that
the war taxes may cause the distillers to close down their
factories and thus eliminate the trouble at its source.
GCMPERS APPEALS TO LABOR.
Samuel Gompers president of the American Federation
of Labor to encourage Liberty Loan, labor activities,
caused the following appeal to be sent to the unions
throughout the country:
"To buy a Liberty Bond is to support our country and
to subscribe to ideals which our country is forced to main
tain by military force. .All workers and labor organiza
tions will find it advantageous to support this loan as ex
tensively as lies within their financial ability. Money
from their sale is indespensible to the successful conduct
of the war. Bond subscriptions become a highly patriotic
and Intelligent way to render service to our Republic and
to the cause of Democracy internationally."
Gompers' attitude is that of every patriotic working
man and of every other patriotic man, regardless of bis
station in life, in the country. The head of the American
Federation of Labor infers, in his appeal for support for
the Liberty Loan that the labor of the country increase
their efficiency and. consequently, their savings.
So far, the state of Arizona has been slow, particularly
the workingmen of the state and particularly those affil
iated with the unions, in following the advice of Gompers.
Rather have they taken the opposite position and sought
tn take advantage of the occasion for ulteriar purposes,
which can not but help prejudice the success of the na
tional undertaking.
BOOTLEGGERS' WILES.
With the lid of the "bone dry" law clamped down tight
ly in Arizona and on the Arizona roads leading into tills
state, the bootleggers have adopted many' schemes for
fooling the -officers. Only this week on Importer of
whiskey was arrested in Lowell and, upon investigation,
was found to be carrying about fifteen gallons of the
concoction in his gasoline tank.
'Necessity is the mother of iavention' !s an aphorism
SAVING A GOOD MEASURE.
Througn tne prompt work of the Cochise Taxpayers'
Association and disinterested, public spirited citizens in
this region of the state the referendum against the High
way Commission Measure, passed at the last session of
the state legislature, failed and the law went into effect
yesterday. After the forces, which would make for con
stant betterment in the matter of road building in the
state began their work, the looters of county bond issues
and treasuries sought cover.
Arizona Is to be congratulated on securing a really
constructive piece of legislation looking to the admin
istration of its road bonds. The Highway Commission
measure provides that the board of supervisors, after a
bond issue has carried, shall appoint a highway commis
tion, consisting of reputable citizens who shall administer
the expenditure of the money and the construction of
roads. '
By this bill the; building of roads -will be taken, to
very large extent, out of politics. Business men will
serve. And they will serve without remuneration. There
will be no "pork" to distribute. The people will get their
money's worth and the county will get good roads. Th
example of Pima County, where a nasty fight is now in
progress, 1b too fresh in the minds of observing people,
to desire a continuation of the old system.

PREMIUMS AND THE BOND ISSUE.
Every conceivable device has been used in the present
campaign for the subscription of the Liberty Loan. Bonds
have been sold over "bargain" counters in big depart
ment 8 tores; they will be given as stock bonuses by sev
eral large corporations and they have been offered to
employees in many different ways. It takes a Douglas
mining company to introduce the Liberty Loan as a stiru
ulous to the purchase of mining stock.
The particular Douglas company desires to sell 25,001
shares of its capital stock at twenty five, cents a share.
This issue would cost the customers, if all were sold
$12,500. The company advertises that "ten per cent of
all cash receipts on sales during this time will be ap
plied on the Liberty Bond Fund."
If all of the shares are sold It will mean that the min
Ing company will purchase $1250 of Liberty Loan Bond
This is no inducement to the purchaser of stock but it,
at least, shows an iclinatlon to aid the government and
at the 6ame time proves that ingenuity can be applied ar
a component part of patriotic duty and mining promo
tions.
CENSORSHIP.
In the processes which are creating an American quasi
autocracy for the efficient direction of the American dem
ocracy censorship may prove the most dangerous depart
ure from our principles, says the Chicago Tribune. It If
apparent that criticism must be ffiodified now. Informa
tion must be withheld. But a blanket censorship, with
authority to suppress opinion and all criticism, might do
the country a tremendous damage.
The checks which our system of government imposes
upon its agencies were imposed because it was thought
that only by them could liberty be guaranteed from one
generation to another. The legislative check upon the
administration is weakening and may disappear tempor
arily. Executive order may take the place in a large
measure of legislative act.
To remove the check of criticism, which is the check
of public opinion, might create an absolute autocracy,
benevolent and efficient, we may admit, but nevertheless.

government just now to carry it through a dangerous per

DALLAS, Tex., June 7. The execu
tive committee of the Texas Bankers'
association met today in Dallas and
passed the following resolution:
"The executive committee of the
Texas Bankers' association in session
recommends to the public the purchase
of Liberty Loan bonds. It is our opin
ion that the purchase of the bonds is
a patriotic necessity. The bonds con
stitute an investment of absolute se
curity and they yield a very fair rate
of interest when It is considered that
they are exempt from taxation.
The officers of the Federal Reserve
bank, of Dallas, in charge of the Lib
erty Loan for the eleventh United
States district, call the attention of ev
eryone to the strove resolution.
The banker is a responsible man, a
friend and advisor of his client In
the country districts, especially, is the
influence of the banker felt In partic
ular we draw the attention of the
farmer to the resolution referred to.
Many a man has been hesitating be
cause he did not thoroughly under
stand the nature of a Tkond. Now rep
resentative bankers from all tover the
state tell him the purpose of the Lib
erty bonds is a necessity and they ad
vise purchase as an investment"

All Known War Methods.
Today's attack was accomplished
by all the arts and devil tricks of
latter day war. The enemy guns and
gun crews had been bathed for days
in gas' shells sent over by the long
range British guns. The night was
filled with red flames. Shells that
spurted molten lead in streams crash
ed in appalling numbers about the
heads of the defending .soldiers. High
explosive and shrapnel fire was car
ried out with such rapidity that the
earth writhed undef the force of the
attacks.
Mines that had taken toy years to
dig and fill with an overwhelming ex

flaming destruction in the half light

both strategically and geographically

WASHINGTON. June 6. Tiie pro

"The general testimony is to the

of Dr. Blackwood (commanding the
Solace) and his assistants. Tuey were

WASHINGTON, June 7. A mass of

commission by the railroads In rebut
tal of evidence presented by the ship
pers opposing a 15 per cent general
freight rate increase. The rebuttal

George W. Lamb, assistant comp

operation of -the Adamson law would
cost the road $750,000 in 1917, while
increases in the cost of other labor
would bring the payroll to $3,141,200

$8,000,000 to $10,000,0(K). were written

about the cost one must pay for a
small jar of the ordinary cold creams.
Care should be taken to strain the
lemon Juice through a fine cloth so

Just try it! Get three ounces of

BY REVIEW
(By Review Leased Wire).
NEW YORK, June 7. Subject to
persistent profit taking which became
too strong in the later dealings to be
ignored, today's extremely active mar
ket registered further general ad
vances, especially among industrials.
The trading was of such exceptional
breadth as to heighten the Impression
of growing public participation.
United States Steel maintained its
leadership, rising 2 to 134, this
being equal, adding recent dividends
of 4 VI per cent, to 128, and exceed
ing its previous maximum by 1
points. Steel's contribution to the
day's hugs total of 1.320.0O0 shares
was fully 25 per cent. Rails failed to
throw off their recent lethargy, ex
cept for realtive strength in the Paci
fies, and a few other issues.
A new low retord of 25 for Russian
exchange, concurrent with further
heaviness of Russian government
bonds, excited little interest, rubles
Improving slightly in the latter part
cf the session. Coppers were notably
hgh.
Heavy buying of Anglo-French o's
at a slight advance featured the bond
market. Total sales, par value $3,
87S.000. U. S. registered 4's were per
cent lower on call.
CHICAGO GRAINS.
CHICAGO, June 7.---Notwithetand-ing
that the corn market continued to
show remarkable activity today, sen
sational advances in prices received a
decided check. Prospects of warmer
weather and of consequent better field
conditions for the growing crop did a
good deal to ease down values. The
close was heavy at the same as yes
terday's finish to three cents lower,
with July at 153', to 153. and Sep
tember at 1421 to 143. Wheat closed
unsettled fit net decline to 3 cents
advance, with Julv at 222 aM Sep
tember at 195. Oats lost to 1.
The outcome in " provisions ranged
from 5 off to a rise of 7.
Bulls were handicapped by numer
ous reports that country offerings of
cash corn had become enlarged over
nieht to a material extent and that
shippers and industries had made Jib
erl purchases.
Talk of chances that the govern
ment crop report tomorrow would
prove bearish contended against the
buving side of the wheat market. Gen
eral exception was that the winter
crop would be about 380,000,000 bush
els. Oats sagged owing largely to pre
dictions that the government report
tomorrow would be bearish on oats
as well as wheat.
Provisions were quiet and irregular.

BRITISH DEAL MIGHTY
BLOW TO GERMANS
. (Continued From Page One)
ter the battle" began that word came
from all the sectors of the fighting
ironi inai inn various oojecuves nau
Leen taken o'h scheduled time.
: m Terrific Explosion.
All the" "prisoners say the Germans
had been expecting the attack,, but
were taken completely by surprise by
the hour at which it was launched
and the furry with which it was car
ried forward. They had been coin-
pletely dazed by the most gigantic op -
cration yet carried out in the world
war.
More than 1,000.000 pounds of high
explosives had been placed under the
German forward positions during the
last 12 months and the upheaval of a
score 'of 'separate mines spread panic
among me iroops, aireaay narrasseu
as they were to the point of distraction
by several days and nights of fire from
the greatest concentration of guns at
a given point since the war began. :
The battle of Arras apparently had
reached the ultimate in this respect.
tut todays bombardment was carried
out by 20 per cent more guns, especi
ally guns of heavy calibre.
Hope For Ypres.
The Messines ridge long has been a
thorn In the side of the British. They
were driven from it In those perilous
days of October, 1914, when the weak
lines and virtually no artillery they
hrnjvely but forlornly attempted to
hold this point of vantage.
If all of todays gains are held the
pressure on poor old Ypres. which
has resisted every effort of the Ger
mans, will be effectively relevd.
Not much is left of Ypres but its crum
bling walls and brick dust but the Brit
ish have held it, all of the territory
which survived in the little k'ingdom
overrun by the Germans in their mad
dash against France.
WAR BUDGET BILL '
AGAIN TURNED DOWN
AFTERGONFERENCE
House Refuses To Adopt
Measure Because of Clause
Authorizing Purchase of
Exposition Buildings.
(By Review Leased Wire.)
WASHINGTON, June 7, The house
today rejected the conference report
of the $3,281,194,641 war budget bill
because pf a 13,000.000. appropriation
Inserted by the senate for the pur
chase of old Jamestown Exposition
site and buildings and the construc
t'on of a naval base and training sta
tion there.
The bill was sent back to the con
ferees with instructions to eliminate
the exposition site provision. This
probably will be done promptly in
order not to further delay the great
war measure which now has been the
subject of conferences for two weeks
withi disagreements over various pro
visions. What shall become of the navy de
partment's request that the site be
acquired for an urgently needed naval
base and training station on Hampton
Roads will be left to"the naval com
mittees. They probably will report a
square bill later.
