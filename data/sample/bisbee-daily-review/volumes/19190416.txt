Teutons Over Peace Terms
Adriatic Situation as It Effects
Italy and Jugo-Slavia Is
Chief Point to Be Settled
i BY THE ASSOCIATED PRESS
A sharp forward stride toward an
early peace has been taken. The coun
cil of four in- Paris has formally in
vited Germany to send delegates to
Versailles April 25, there to hear the
verdict of the entente allies and asso
ciated powers and the sentence they
have imposed upon her for having set
the world aflame.
The general opinion in Paris seems
to be that Germany may endeavor to
haggle over the hard terms and try
to secure a diminution In their sever
ity, but that within a relatively short
time the delegates will bow to the
inevitable and Bign the compact. ' Ad
vices from London are to the effect
that the terms of the peace treaty will
not be made public until they -have
been delivered to the Germans.
The expectation In the French cap
ital is that President Wilson will re
main In France until the peace treaty
is signed .and bring back the com
pleted document to the United States.
The Adriatic situation as it affects
Italy and Jugo-Slovia Is now the chief
point tinder consideration by the
council of four. Arthur J. Balfour,
the British foreign minister, is act
ing as alternate on the council for
David Lloyd George, who is on a vaca
tion to England.
Trouble in Bavaria
Pending the conclusion of the peace
agreement Germany is to be permitted
by , the allied governments to pur
chase surplus stocks of their raw ma
terials. This has been-'ctecided on by
the economic council.' Then decision
will permit ? Germany to commence
manufacturing and begin the accumu
lation of 'the money that is to be re
quired of her to settle the financial
claims of the allies. The reparations
commission is investigating the fin
ancial situation of Austria-Hungary,
Bulgaria and Turkey and their ability
to pay war claims.
Troublous times continue In Ba
varia. The communists in Munich
again hold the upper hand, according
to reports. There has been further
heavy fighting in the streets of the
city. Reinforced loyal troops of the
Hoffmann government nsed artillery
against the communists strongholds
but are declared to have been defeat
ed. Many persons are reported to have
been killed or wounded.
. Strike in Berlin
The strike in Danzig has been in
progress for several days. The strike
of the bank clerks in Berlin is In full
swing, and the clerks In Mannheim
and Chemnitz have Joined in a similar
movement.
Considerable fighting has taken
place on the Russian fronts. The bol
sheviki have suffered severe defeats
on the Archangel and Murmansk coast
sectors at the hands of the allies, but
in the south the Rumanians have been
compelled by the bolshevik! to retreat
over a wide front into Bessarabia.
Petlura, leader of the Ukrainian peas
ant army, also has been forced to cede
ground to the bolsheviki.
Secretary of War Baker, who has ar
rived in Paris, in a statement tells
of the plans that are afoot for the
rapid repatriation of the American
soldiers In Europe. During the pres
ent month 275.000 of them will come
home and in May 250,000 more. In
June it Is expected to transport 300,
000 men. and this number is to be
maintained monthly until the 1.400.000
soldiers are back in the United States

338,000 Tons of Supplies Dis
tributed by U. S., Hoover
Report Shows , ,
PARIS, April 15. (By the Associat
ed Press.) The supreme economic
council has decided that Belgium may
be represented thereon, in view of the
many questions affecting that coun
try.
The council has received the . report
of the director general of relief mea
sures effected by the United States
Showing that 388,000 tons of supplies
to the value of 1111,280,000 have been
distributed. The council considered
measures to increase supplies and
shipping during the current months.
The serious deficiency in coal in
Italy today led the economic council
to appoint a committee to devise
means for an immediate increase of
the supply.
A plan for offering surylus stocks
of raw materials in the possession of
the allied governments for sale to
the German government during the
period prior to the signing of the
peace treaty has been approved by the
supreme economic council.
The official statement on the work
of the council says: .
"The supreme ' economic council
held its fifth meeting Monday, April
14, at 10 a. m. under the chairman
ship of Vance McCormick. '
"It was decided, in view of the large
number of questions coming before
the council which particularly affect
Belgium, that the . Belgian govern
ment should nominate a representa
tive who shall have the right to at
tend the meetings of the council.
"The disposal of surplus stocks of
raw material in possession of the al
lied governments tor sale to the Ger
man government during the period
prior to th treaty of peace, under-arrangements
to be worked out by a spe
cial committee was approved.
"The director general of relief sub
mitted a review of relief measures ef
fected by the United States, Great
Britain, France and Italy during the
month of March through the co-ordination
of the supreme economic council,
which shows that supplies amounting
to more than 388,000 tons, to a total
value of 111180,000 were distributed
during the month. (Director General
Hoover's figures recently given out
were 388,041 tons to the value of f 95,
100.000). 9
"The council considered the mea
sures necessary to increase the cup
plies, finance and shipping required
for the following months.
"The council again considered the
serious deficieucies in the Italian coal
situation, and a committee was ap
pointed to devise definite measures
for the Immediate Increase of the in

PRESIDENT WILSON TO STAY IN EUROPE
UNTIL PEACE TREATY IS SIGNED BY FOE
DD
E1ER OF
Lloyd George to Face Critics
. in House of Commons, En
gaging in a General Debate
Government's Policy at Peace'
Conference Under Fire;
Press Criticizes Minister
LONDON, April 15. (By the Asso
ciated Press.) It has fallen to the lot
of David Lloyd George, as hasvbefallen
few of his predecessors in the pre
mier's office, to meet and grapple with
highly charged political and personal
crises.
The prime minister left the Paris
conference yesterday for a brief, meet
ing with the members of the house of
commons. He had a stormy passage
of the channel in a destroyer, and will
return to Paris Thursday with his mis
sion accomplished. .Now he will, acquit
himself as a subject which is agitating
politicians, as few topics of the past
few months have stirred them.
The purpose of the premier's visit is
to explain the government's policy and
hl3 personal part in the conference.
He will confront a house of commons
which contains a sharply critical fac
tion, and, indlrecUy, will reply to the
critical section of the press, of which
Lord Northcliffe's Daily Mail has been
the leader. The tenor of the criticism
directed against him is that he has
been too lenient towards Germany and
has relented from his election pledges
to make Germany pay all the costs of
the war and to punish the former em
peror. The premier's reply has awakened
so much interest that the demand for
seats in the house of commons is
great, since it became known he would
speak on these topics. Interest is
heightened by the fact that the coun
cil of four has decided that the terms
of the peace treaty should not be pub
lished until after they have been pre
sented to the Germans.
The premier will have a most deli
cate diplomatic feat to perform in sat
isfying the curiosity of the whole
country and parrying his critics,
without telling more than the compact
with his Paris colleagues permits.
Mr. Lloyd George scored a tactical
point, or Andrew Bonar Law did in his
behalf, yesterday by the statement
that the premier will conclude the de
bate. His critics had expected him
to make his explanations first, and
that they would thereby be given am
munition with which to bombard him.
Instead of this, the critics must
launch their arrows first, and largely
in the dark, and will thus give him
the advantage, the premier's friends
say, of exposing their ignorance.
WOMEN START ROW IN
HOUSE OF. COMMONS
LONDON, April 15. (By the Asso
ciated Press.) There was an unusual
Bcene in the house of commons to
night During a discussion of a labor
motion on pensions two women in the
strangers' gallery began shouting:
"You are murderers. You have not
settled .the last war. You are leading
the people and workers to another
war."
They were immediately hustled out
by attendants. Then a third woman,
slowly arose and exclaimed: "We
want the soviet."
This woman left quietly when re
quested by attendants.

German Congress . Adjourns
After Independents Re- '

BERLIN, April 15. (By. the Asso

yesterday of the soviet congress a pro
posal to send a committee of inves
tigation to Russia was referred to
the central council, and a motion con
demning Germany's foreign policy
was adopted. The council then elect
ed a central council.
The central council was declared
thehighest authority of all the work
ers and peasants' councils and fixing
the numbers of members at twenty
eight The congress adjourned after a
futile effort on the part of the ma
jorities to induce the independents to
accept ten seats in the new central
council- A motion by the independ
ent? in favor of equal representa
tion of the two parties on the council
was repjected.
Haase's party, on a strict party
strength basis, was only entitled to
five seats, but the independents stub
bornly refused to compromise. Hence
the congress elected a council of only
twenty-one, leaving seven seats open
for the indpendents.
The council consists of sixteen of
the majority socialists; two soldier
delegates and three scattered.
It is still possible that the inde
pendents will accept the seven prof
fered seats.

(By Review Leased Wire)
SACRAMENTO. April 15. Gov.
William D. Stephens signed today the
Harris prohibition enforcement bill
that defines any liquid containing
more than one-halt of one per cent
by volume of alcohol as intoxicating.
The bill is intended to provide machin
ery for the enforcement In California
of national prohibition when it be
comes effective. A provision in the
bill makes it invalid if national prohi
bition should not become effective.
PEACE S001
TO BE FACT,
IS PROMISE
Council Now Working on
Plan to Be Followed When
German Delegates Meet
Final Course to Be Pursued
by Conference to Be Decid
ed by Big Four and House
PARIS, April 15. (By the Associat
ed Press.) Now that the Germans
have been called to Versailles on April
25, the indications are that the pro
ceedings may move with such dispatch
that President Wilson can remain for
the signing of the treaty, and thus
be able to take back the completed
document.
This was the view of the president's
intimates today when their attention
was called to tho reports in French
papers that his departure had been
fixed for -April 2$. It was declared that
no such intention had been formed,
and that the progress on the main
questions gave promise that the presi
dent would not only attend the open
ing of the congress at Versailles but
would remain long enough to see its
work carried through, though pro
longed delay by the enemy delegates
would, of course, prevent such action.
Details Under Way
Precise details of what is to be done
on the arrival of the German delegates
are being worked out. Preliminary to
their arrival, a plenary session of the
peace conference is to be held at the
foreign office for determination of the
final course to be pursued by the allies
before entering into relations with
the German plenipotentaries.
Whether the treaty and covenant
will both pe presented has not yet
been decided, but it is probable that
the treaty portion of the document
will not be made public until after its
delivery to the Germans.
The procedure with the enemy pleni
potentiaries is also receiving atten
tion. One plan under consideration is
for the council of four to hold the first
meeting with the Germans and deliver
the document. This would not be a
public session, and its main purpose
would be to arrange effective disposal
of the business without prolonged dis
cussion. '
End Now In Sight
An alternative plan is for the entire
membership of the ' peace conference
to proceed to Versailles for a formal
session, at which the treaty would be
delivered. President Wilson, Colonel
Hquse.x the members of the council
and officers of the protocol are work
ing out these details.
Premier Clemenceau oh Sunday and.
President Wilson last night gave out
statements "showing the progress real
ized and voicing their first official as
surances that the end was in sight. It
is noted that the Clemenceau and Wil
son statements were very general,
lacking specific details.
And there is every reason to believe
that the statement which the British
prime minister, Mr. Lloyd George, is
expected to give out tomorrow, will
be of the same general character. ,

TO PAY 15 CLAIMS
Claims Nqt Covered by Spe
cific Appropriations Are
Held Invalid
- By Review Leas?l Wire)
PHOENIX. April 15. John Boyce,
state auditor, announced tonight that
under the provisions of senate bill
No. 90, as interpreted by his office
and backed by the legal opinion of
Attorney General Wylie Jones .he
will refuse to pay claims not covered
by specific appropriations.
Boyce- named the following fifteen
accounts to issue warrants after the
new law 'goes into effect June 13:
National guard salaries; 'printing
reports of state officers; printing de
cisions of the supreme court; state
tax commission expenses outside of
salaries; state board of equalization
expenses; state veterinarians' mile
age; premiums on bonds of state of
ficers; loans to counties for bridge
building; state funds for high and
normal schools for teaching voca
tional work; county fair assistance;
county scholarships; county commis
sioner expenses; expenses and mile
aeg of state health officer; expenses
of superior judges sitting as supreme
court justices; vocational education.
Senate bill No. 90 provided that it
"would be a punishable offense for a
state officer, board or commission to
exceed the appropriation for the fis
cal year. Unless amended the new
law will go into effect June 30.
Boyce's refusal to issue warrants
is expected in capital circles to pre
cipitate a legal battle, the first stage
of which probably will be an at
tempt to obtain a court order forcing
the state auditor to issue the dis
puted warrants.
On senate bill No. 90, as touching
the tax commission, Governor Camp
bell announced today he had obtained
legal advice to Vthe effect th.t it
would operate against the commis
sion's continuing fund, and that it
would have the one effect ot forcing
the state to designate for what par
ticular purposes taxes are being
raised. Instead of lumping the entire
levy ifa the general fund.

Doctors, Lawyers and Priests
Killed; One Shot Because
He Lived in Brick House
Many Thrown Into Pit and
Buried ; Rob the Churches
of District of Everything
OMSK, Saturday, April 15. (By the
Associated Press.) Indisputable evi
dence of the .massacre by the bolshe
viki of more than 2000 civilians in
and near the town of Osa, has been
obtained by Messrs. Simmonds and
Emerson and Dr. Rudolph Teusler of
the American Red Cross, who have
just returned from Perm. Osa, and
other ruined Russian territory. Ap
proximately 500 persons were killed at
Osa and 1500 in the surrounding dis
tricts. Osa,' which had population of 10.000,
was so denuded of males by the bol
sheviki that General Cssagraude. upon
"One occupation of (he town, was
obliged to telcgrnpli to Yekaterinburg
for men to administer civic affairs.
In addition to securing verbal and
documentary evidence the Red Cross
officials witnessed the exhuming of
scores of victims from trenches. The
murders were without provocation,
and the victims were largely, of the
thritty and intelligent classes or ser
vants of the church.
All Doctors Killed
. The evidence discloses almost un
thinkable atrocities. A man was shot
because he lived in a briekhouse. All
attornes and jurists were killed, and
doctors, whose services were not re
quired for the moment, were disposed
ot in a similar manner.
A woman whose Jiusband and two
sons had been seized, applied to the
commissar for intonnation as to their
fate. She was told they had been
taken to Perm. After repeating her
visit several times, she was informed
that if she bothered the commlssory
again she would be shot, as they had
been.
A wiferequired to pay a thousand
rubles for the release of her husband,
borrowed S00 and paid it over, later
she returned with the remainder and
then was Informed that her husband
had been shot. There were scores ot
similar cases.
The soviet called a meeting and pre
pared lists of those to die. The. houses
prescribed were visited by squads, the
doors were smashed in and the vic
tims dragged to the edge of the town
and forced to dig their own graves.
Those resisting were shot in the
streets.
A survivor testified that he had
seen men thrown into a pit and buried
alive.
The bolshevik attitude toward tho
church was uncompromising. Priests
were hunted unmercifully. ' Tho evi
dence showed that men were slain
whose only offense was that they
worked as sextons or caretakers of
churches.
In the Perm district everything was
stolen from the churches. In some
places the schools continue, but re
ligious teaching' is barred, branches or
study being dependent upon commit
tees of the pupils.
Careful inquiry, the American ob
servers say, show that there was noth
ing constructive in any town under
bolsheviki control. Money and prop
erty were requisitioned and extrava
gantly dissipated by individuals with
out accounting. The hospital at Perm
was short of doctors. Out of five, two
were killed and two were taken awntr.
It Is reliably related that the bol
sheviki drafted into the new Russian
army who went to the front uttering
Threats that they would refuse to
fight against their brother bolsheviki.
were disenchanted on witnessing the
results of the bolsheviki occupation,
and developed into the most ardent
enemies of the bolsheviki.

shimmy dance at all. Of course
anybody can vulgarize any dance.
There was strenuous objection to
the waltz, the two-step; in fact,
there are plenty, of people who
regard dancing itself as a work
Oi the devil and leading straight
to perdition.
"But such old-fashioned notions
are rapidly going, out of Btyle.
Dancing is beautiful, healthful;
it creates grace and charm; it
brings happiness; it is a method
of self-expression just like music
or painting and one in which
the average man or woman can
soon learn to excel, if he or she
has a sense of rythm at all.
"The 'shimmy,' properly done,
is not at all objectionable. Evil
dwells in the mind, not in the

anything. The 'shimmy' is all
right."
Bids on Certificates to Be Re
ceived May 7, -Then
Opened by Council
With Mayor Jacob Erickson presid
ing tne city council met last night at
7:30 -with all members present. The
meeting opened up with the . reading
and adoption of an ordinance levying
taxation by which ?200,000 in road
bonds would be redeemed in 20 years.
After the passing of the ordinance a
resolution was read and accepted ahd
the publishing of botfc the ordinance
and .resolution were favorably acted
upon the publishing of same being
' awarded to the Daily Review by unan
imous approval of the council.
Sealed proposals for the sale of the
bends will be received on the 17th of
May up until 5 p. m., when they will
be opened and awarded to the success
ful bidder.
After the road bonds had been thor
oughly considered P. E. Barnes pre
sented himself before the council and
requested that he be authorixed to pile
some dirt on Mason avenue in Spring
canyon for the purpose of digging a 20
foot well. The matter was referred to
the city engineer and -street commit
tee. Pest house considered
H. C. Ayres then appeared and put
in a bid for the repairing and re
modeling cf the pest house. Miss
Keith, who is in charge of the pest
house, also had representation at the
meeting and it was stated that same
was in a very bad condition and sadly
in need of repairs. The matter was
referred to the health committee with
power to act without delay. With ref
erence to the bid put in by Mr. Ayres
it was the orinion of the council that
competition -should be invited Inas
much as the construction and repairs
amounted to more than $500 and as a
result Mr. Ayres' bid was returned to
him.
City Engineer Halleck then took the
floor and occupied it for some time.
Among pther matters he brought be
fore the council for consideration, wa
authority to sell the city's old garbage
truck The council was of the opinion
that if Mr. Halleck could get a buyer
it wpuld be highly proper for him to
dispose of it.
Would Build Culvert
Mr. Halleck then asked for permis
sion to build a culvert at the end of
Naco read. At present there are no
funda on hand in the paring fund so
he urged that the money be taken
from the bridge and culvert fund ana
later on returned to that fund as soon
as the paving fund was available. The
council granted the authority. '
At the head of Tombstone canyon
permission was granted for the in
stallation of two concrete tops. The
money to pay for this repairinswjll,
come out of the bridge and covert
fund. , '.
The narrowing of the pavement on
lower Naco road to 20 feet was then
discussed. The original plan was to
lay a 25 foot pavement on this street
but the width would interfere with the
street car .tracks. There was much
discussion on this subject, a majority
of the councilmen contending that the I
tflirnl r r V. i r- v4 t ..-As vrnwr V. .... n r. A
as much room as possible would be
. needed. The matter was finally re
ferred to the city engineer with in
structions to get as many feet of pav
ing as possible.
The question then came up about
the renumbering of houses. City At
torney Kyle stated that the ice man
had been trying to deliver ice to his
house for a week but that he couldn't
find it. He also said that some books
had been en route to him for some
time but that they had not as yet ar
rived. This remark was taken with
much laughter by the council. How
ever, they passed the matter up with
out any definite action.
Authorize Retaining Wall
Immediate action was authorized for
the building of a retaining wall from
Williams street in front of the Gar
field school to the Hogan property.
The school has agreed to pay for ball
of this" improvement work and work
will begin at once. - ' ' '

It was pointed out by John T.

half the amount of agricultural prod

than the eight mountain states. The
funds are apportioned on the basis of

more than 25C0 not being considered,
according to Mr. Caine.
There are many towns in the inter
mountain district, Mr. Caine said,
which are slightly over 2500 in popu

the distribution in the inter-mountain
district unfair.

Is tobacco next on the prohibitionists' platform? Will it he as
hard to obtain in another generation as whisky or beer? Every man at
some time or other lately has asked that question.
The war has taken the curse off the clgaret. Before .we "got into it,"
cigaret smoking was more or less taboo. It was tolerated but had none
of the respectability of cigars or even of pipes that smell like a garbage
disposal plant.
Our overseas army has been using 425 million cigarets a month.
Now along come incorporation papers for the Anti Cigarette League
of Ohio. Several western states, including Iowa, have long tried to
prevent cigaret smoking, unsuccessfully.
But the battle against Demon Rum was waged in this country for 111
years. The fight against tobacco is just starting. - We laugh at it as
drinking men laughed in the early days of the prohibition movement.
If you hate tobacco, you can find medical records of tests showing
that it decreases efficiency from 1 to 50 per cent. If you are an ally
of the fragrant stimulant, other scientists have very kindly recorded
other tests, proving it harmless.
Therein lies the reason for tobacco's popularity it satisfies. An
obliging weed, it agrees with foe as well as friend. Heavy war taxes
have been unable to kill it The well-meaning anti-tobacco people may
be right, but few tears will be shed because they stand small chances of
killing Lady Nicotine during our lifetime. So again we fill up the old
pipe. Have you got a match?
Diversity of Opinion
A Paris newspaper of reaction is quoted as saying that the way to
handle the Hungarian Soviet government is "drown it in blood."
A famous bandmaster in one of our large cities says we need more
music because "the more music the less bolshevism."
The most persistently advised cure for bolshevism Is food.
The bolsheviks themselves are feeding Russia with propaganda and
it is a saying there that "books are the cheapest thing in Russia,"
Out of the many wilderness voices that cry at us how to' save the
world, we must be learning something we, the average American citizen.
Guizot, the great French writer who produces a "History of Civilization,"-
laid his central emphasis on the point that the, distinguishing
characteristic of civilization and progress is "diversity of opinion."
We remember one young man in peg top pants who lay on a campus
green one spring and nearly thought his head off trying to get at exactly
what Guizot meant by "diversity of opinion" because it seemed to be
the most important ingredient necessary for lasting and genuine human
progress. - -
Now wo understand. In a big and real way there is a more rapid
rate of human progress just now than any time in all history if it is
true that "diversity of opinion is the distinguishing characteristic of
civilization."
Snobbery
Snobbery stands in the way of democracy. So we arc told. And
there's a lot to it.
Snobs and democrats (small "d") never get along. One lives to show
off. The other lives to work and be real. " They look at life two different
ways.
Democracy means a man should pay for his living by doing soma
sort of work that produces wealth or helps the world get through the
day better off. The first and high sign by which we know the snob when
we see him coming is that he always tries to look as though he never
works, being a born gentleman who knows all about the eclairs and
eclat of the elite.
In Americanizing America, we must make the important question
about a man, "What can he do?" or "What has he done?" rather than
the question, "How much has he got?" or "Where did he come from?"
Since Elihu Root gave an opinion ravorable to the brewers, the drys
are wondering if he is related to that friend of Job's, Elihu the son of
Buzite.
Bavaria has gone bolshevik, and if we are not careful some thought
less person will tell the peace delegates about it and disturb their medi
tations. ,
The announcement that a British plane will fly across the Atlantic
on April 16 doesn't Interest us. What we want to know is whether 'the
dove will fly by that date.

States produces 900 million pounds of "smokln" an chewin'" yearly, not
to mention half a million dollars worth of cob pipes from five towns in
Missouri, alone. .
The fragrant weed had been known all through history. People of
Tibet smoked it 2300 years ago. They called it tha-ma-kha which is
nothing to what we have heard rank cigars called.
Just how injurious is tobacco?
Dr. Welch has proven that tobacco smoke kills cholera germs.
Dr. A. Debove of the University of Paris says: "All food will poison
if taken in excess. Potatoes are almost as rich in poison as is to
bacco." Cavallaro found that tobacco sterilizes the saliva. Tassinari and
Molish proved that it kills germs has an antiseptic value.
One doctor says it deadens the brain. Another medical man re
calls that Stevenson, who wrote "Dr. Jekyll and Mr. Hyde" .in three nights
smoked 20 cigars or 80 cigarets daily. ' ,
On the other hand
Nicotine is a very deadly poiscn. On drop kills a cat in 7S seconds.
The raw leaf of all tobaccos contains from one to eight per cent nicotine.
Yet the smoke of even strong Turkish tobacco contains no nicotine at all.
Nor are we cats.
How Not to Amuse Your Wife
Mrs. Ella M. Kellar of Baltimore,
Md.. told on the witness stand how
her husband came home one dav atfer
being out all night, took off his shoes i
and began playing with his toes. Mrs.
Kellar was dramatic in the recitation,
telling how her husband lay down on
the sofa and whiled away the morning
hours tickling his pedal extremities.
ana remembrances were civen her
by members of the Red Cross force
and her friends in the hospital zone.
The non-commissioned officers pre
sented her with an unusually beauti
ful ivory toilet set to be remembered
by her on her vacation as being ap
preciative of the many kindnesses she
had so often shown them and every
one in the hospital zone. .
Miss Ryan will be the recipient of
many social affairs during her visit

in Mexico late today in federal court
as a witness in the trial of himself
and eleven others, "charged with set
ting on foot a military expedition in
Mexico. They were arrested March
18, near Socorro ,Tex., on the Rio

Cervantes told the jury he was a
graduate of Chapultepec military
academy with honors, was sent by
President Madero to study aeronau
tics in the French army, acted as an
officer instructor in the French fly

acted as chief of staff and minister in
the provisional president's cabinet un
der the Aguascalientes convention of
1915, to which he was a delegate from
the army of Sonora.
During his testimony Colonel Cer

at 30.000 pesos in Mexico City, an in

pesos in Mexico and other property,
all of which had been confiscated by
General Pabo Gonzales, he said. He
added that he had been driving a jit

prior to his arrest. He reviewed the
history of the Carranza-Villa break,
and denied he had ever served with
Villa after that time.

National Dual Golf Champion

(Uy Review I-onsrrt AVire
CHICAGO. April 13. Charles
Evans, jr., national amateur and
open golf champion, today an
nounced that he would be unable
to defend his open title, won at
Minneapolis three years ago, be
cause the tournament had been
set for Brae Burn Country club,
Boston, for the week preceding
the western amateur champion
ship to be played at Sunset Hill
club, St. Louis, June 16-21.
The dual champion thought he
would be able to defend his na
tional amateur title at Oakmont,
August 18-23. Reports from other
golfing stars have brought com
plaints that the United States
Golf association set the date of
the national open so close to the
western amateur meet, as that af
fair has, by invitation of the
Western Golf association, been

SYSTEMIS TIED UP
Thousands of Operators Out
on Strike; No Agreement
in Sight
1SOSTOX, April 15. New England
settled down tonight to the uncom
fortable realization that telephone ser
vice in this section, except in Connec
ticut, had been almost completely tied
up by the strike of several thousand
operators of the New England Tele
phone & Telegraph company, and the
proviJence Telephone company. The
girls walked out at 7 a. m.
No move toward a" settlement had
been made tonight. The operators
seek a wage advance and the oppor
tunity of bargaining directly with the
officials of the companies. They de
clare that since the wire swere taken
over by the postoffice department they
have been unable to obtain proper con
sideration of their demands. Postmas
ter General Burleson has insisted that
he has provided machinery for the
handling of wage questions and thai
the operators have failed to take ad
vantage of it.

From R. A. Long, Sec'y-Treas.
Associated wi t h Messrs.
Nance, Hemphill and Duncan, it
has been my pleasure to have
been connected with the promo
tion , of two other oil compa
nies,. in Burbumett. which companies-are
now producing oil in
paying' qualities. I faithfully
looked after the affairs of these
companies because I wanted
the public, my friends, associ
ates and myself to have a
square deal. I v.as financially
interested in these companies,
as 1 am in the present company.
I will put forth the came efforts
to further the interest of this
company and take care of the
stockholders' interest as I have
before.
My record so far is cne that
any. man would be proud of as
an oil man, and my associates
fcearf a ' like record. I expect
and intend to maintain this rec
ord,"! and I promise YOU that
I will guard YOUR interest; be
cause your interest is my in
terest. I -believe that we will get a
good well on our 42 acres. When
we do, I will make money, my
associates will, and YOU, the
stockholders in general, will.
Should we fail to strike oil.
YCOJ-are the WINNER cn our
GUARANTEE PLAN. We are
practically betting $25,000.00
that WE WILL STRIKE OIL.
I have been on the lease many
times, and I am not afraid we
are going to lose the bet.
If you want to follow the ad
vice of men who have been in
the field continuously since last
September, whose judgment has
merit, and ycu are businessman
or -businesswoman of sufficient
pluck, to take a reasonable
chance, I fully recommend the

clinking that is music to the ears of
one who deals in cards. It "was the
clatter of chips not potato but hon-est-to-goodness
poker chips.
Outside the entrance two faithful
guardians of the law who had been
trailing on the scent of the sound that
had perplexed stood in breathless sil
ence. They "allowed" as how some
thing must be "purty nigh" wrong.
And something was wrong.
Stooping down to that portion of the
door that belonged exclusively to the
key-hole. Deputy Sheriff R. M. Gilman
took a long observing peep through
that part of the door that has figured
in innumerable divorce and scandal
cases. And what did he behold before after the war."
durin gthe war. Appearing today be
fore t,he committee of the American
Bar association, which is conducning
an inquiry. General Menoher said that
with some elaboration of regulations
to make the system more easily un
derstandable to officers serving only
for a war emergency, he saw no neces
sity of changing court martial prac
tice and procedure. (
I do not recall," he said, "that in
this controversy it has ever been
claimed that any innocent man was
found guilty. With regard to the
length of sentences, however, it is an
other matter. We always felt that ad
justment of sentences would be made
his very eyes!
The Plot Thickens
Sitting around a round table that
was all dressed up with an ex-billiard
table cover, three artists of the cards
and Shuffle cast perple'xing glances at
each other. Each was wondering if
the other fellow was bluffing as he
raised the "ante." Each was wonder
ing if three of a kind would see him
through on a three hand deal.
Turning to Deputy Sheriff Tom Fos
ter, Lowell's famous key-hole artist.
Sheriff Gilman whispered gently Into
his ear and Tom stooppd t observe
for himself. And soon he arose pop
eyed and thoroughly convinced that
there was being enacted in that little
room a violation of the law.
After a hurried whispered conversa
tion it was decided that they would
take the place by storm. Two broad
shoulders braced themselves for a
thrust that would make the hinges
tremble with fright. Two broad
shoulders were sent forth against the
door with all their strength and furq.
The hinges shrieked with pain the
lock opened wide and into the din and
the glare completely loaded for bear
six arms were thrust in the air. J. D.
Hensley, John Irwin and W. A. Jen
nings, each holding fair hands for a
three deal game threw down their
cards because the deputy sheriffs held
better hands that were gripping a
more convincing card. The players
were now looking into the barrels of a
couple of frontier cannons.
12 Decks of Cards
On the table that was all dressed up
with green and slightly padded to sil
ence the chips were 12 decks of cards
the seals of which had never been
broken, a bank roll of about (409 and
an assortment of differently colored
chips that ranged all the way from a
nickle up to five and ten dollars.
According to the officers who made
the arrest this game was being ton-
ducted upon a very high plane. Sys
tem will win out in any business and
according to the facts this particular
game had system galore and showed
a nice trial balance on the credit side
of the ledger. One of the notations
in the firms books showed that on
December 29, 1918, poker showed a
net gain of $43.29. That, however,
was one of the weak nights.'
"Booster's Payroll"
A "Booster's Payroll" was also ex
hibited by the arresting officers which
showed that fhe game was conducted
strictly on a business basis. The
"boosters sheet" showed "Mack,"
"Dan" and a few others and it also
showed the amount of money which an
entry had upon taking a chair and the
amount he had when leaving. Most
of them left with a loss and we take it
that the game was a show-down. That
Is, each player would be called called
upon to show his roll before he would
be allowed a seat in the game.

security and up to a late hour yester
day none of the transgressors of the
law had made it and, as a result they
were remanded to jail iu default of
bond to await a preliminary hearing
in the. superior court at Tombstone at
which place charges have been filed.
General Menoher was' asked what
objection he saw to creating a sys
tem of enlisted juries to try cases of
enlisted men.
Approves Suggestion
"I believe it would work," he said,
adding that he had never heard the
suggestion before and was not pre
pared to present a studied reply. "I
have great confidence in the enlisted
man. But I should not want to see
any bolsheviki ideas get into the
minds of the enlisted men. We have
some evidence now in Russia of what
happens in that case."
The olficer also approved a sugges
tion that offenses of a common law
character might be referred to the fed
eral court except in actual war zones.
The army would be glad to get rid of
all trials for anything but military of
fenses, he thought.
So far as the existing military jus
tice system goes. General Menoher
said, there is no escape from the per
sonal element among the officers ap
plying it. It is so bound up with the
question of general discipline, he add
ed, there are no means of divorcing
authority over courts martial from the
functions of military command.
System Declared Adequate
Col. Charles T. Herron, who com
manded the 313th Field Infantry and
later chief of staff of the TSth di
vision, also told the committee that
the present military system was ade
quate but that its success depended
upon the intelligence of the officers.
Courts martial, he said, were much
like whippings for children, at times
they might be necessary but often
they "reflected upon the intelligence
and ingenuity of the parent."
Army officers felt it essential that
justice be given the men. Colonel Her
ron said, because morale depended
upon it and morale was what won bat
tles. Some cases of seemingly exces
sive sentences, he added, were easily
explained by the facts. Ten or 15
years' imprisonment for a week's ab
sence without leave certainly appear
ed heavy, he asserted, but cases of
this kind he had noted in France were
those of men whose week of absence
kept him out of a fight into which
their unit was going. The rear lines of
fill armies, he said, were filled with
me nwandering up and down in search
of their companies, but never quite
finding them. These were "skulker"
cases which formed a separate prob
lem, he thought.
General Menoher said he believed
the number of these cases actually
was small.
"We had practically none of them in
the 42d division," he added. '

. NEW YORK, April 15 The ap
proaching completion of the peace
treaty, as outlined by latest cableE
from Paris, and the encouragement
shown in high financial circles, to
wards the coming Victory loan pro
vided the foundation for another
stron gand very active session of the
stock market today.
Rails were again handicapped by
further" heaviness of St. Paul issues
and some coalers, but Southern Pa
cific held a part of its two point ad
vance although other transcontinen
tal were dull. . -
' Upited States Steel threw off much
of its recent pressure, making its
highest quotation of 99 a gain of
3-4 of a point in the active dealings
that marked the final hour.
Among the strongest features were
Pacific Mail, Marine common and pre
ferred and United Fruit, also Mexican
Petroleum, Texas company, Pan-
jAmerican, Sinclair Oil, Baldwin Loco
motive, American Locomotive, General
Electric, "American Woolen and Indus
trial Alcohol.
Metals, leathers, tobaccos and motor
accessories contributed their usual
proportions, but food and fertilizer is
sues were less prominent. Sales were
1,225,000 shares. - -
The bond market, inclding Liberty
issues, were hesitant on reduced of
ferings. Total sales, par value, ag
gregated $13,375,000. - Old United

Labor Interests to Be Cement
ed Into High Corporation
By Directorate
By RICHARD SPILLANE,
Noted American Economist who
writes on finance and business for
the Review.
More than 10 per cent of the stork
of the United States Steel corporation
is owned today by the employes of the
great company.
It is not improbable these holdings
will be increased within the next five
or ten years to 15 or 20 per cent.
No wonder there Is suggestion of
electing two directors from anions the
workers to represent the interests of
the employes.
Up to the close of the year 1918
there had been 381,234 shares of com-1
nion and 351,114 shares of preferred
stock sold to employes undar the spec
ial arrangement whereby premiums
are received for five years after the
purchase.
In January, 1919, there was a stock
offering to employes at 92. Accord
ing to the best reports obtainable
T3741 employes subscribed at that time
for a total of 15G.C80 shares.
Of the 5,083,025 shares of common
of a par value of $50S,302,000 and a
market value of approximately the
same the employes holdings are 517,
914 shares with a market value of
J51.791.400.
Dividends Paid for Workers
What the workers paid in actual
cash for stock i3 difficult to ascer
tain. The custom of the corporation
has been to offer stock to the em
ployes at 2 points below what in the
best judgment of the directors, is
about the low price of the year. li
the employe holds his stock as an- in
vestment he gets special premiums.
What is more the dividends, especi
ally in the last three years, have been
fat. Not a few subscribers are un
derstood to have been able to pay for
their stock with their dividends so
that practically it cost them nothing.
Of the 3,602,811 shares of prefer
red of a par value of $360,2S1.100 and
a market value of 5417,926,076, the
workers have 351,000 with a market
value of $40,716,000.
Broadly speaking, therefore, the
United States Steel employes that is
the approximately 55,000 who are
shareholders have a 192,000,000 stake
in the corporation.
There are no figures obtainable as
to the number of employes of the
corporation at the present time. In
the rush days of 1916-17 there was a
high mark of 268, 05S names on the"
payroll. That was the biggest total
in the history of the company. Since
then there has been a gradual decline.
A fair estimate of the March roster
would be 225,000. Necessarily the
number of employes changes with con
ditions in the steel trade.
Doc's Enormous Business
Few persons appreciate the magni
tude and scope of this giant corpora
tion. . Its volume of business in one
year has been $1.683.962,552 that is
in excess of $5,500,000 a day for every
work day and Its profits in one year
have been as much as $347,370,400.
For employes, representative of the
labor element in the corporation, to
be elected to the directorate of this
greatest end" most " successful of in
dustrial concerns, would have a pro
found effect in shaping opinion re
garding the future relationship of
capital and labor.
This is appreciated fully by leaders
In finance and labor leaders. Many
men of large influence in the Steel
corporation are bitterly opposed to do
ing anything more toward "coddling"
labor than has .been .done. Some im
portant persons in the ranks of labor
also oppose the idea. They do not
want to see capital and labor agree
on anything. They contend that labor
never has gained anything from capi
tal except through force and 'the two
elements cannot mix with benefit to
labor.
But these men represent the reac
tionaries i-.np tv-' camns. The do
minant spirits in the corporation are
committed to cementing the labor in
terests into the organization as
strongly as the financial Interests are
bound to it, and it is their purpose to
make hte large stock ownership of
the employes effective by member,
ship in the directorate. They are cer
tain to have the?r way. Whether it i
will Iwi ,1 vno ry -ns-tf ram Q in o r

WOMEN'S CLUB MEETS
? TO DISCUSS 5TH LOAN
' The Warren District Women's club
held a meeting yesterday afternoon
at the Commercial , club for ,the pur
pose of discussing ways and means for
the launching of the fifth Liberty loan
war loan drive. According to Mrs.
Sam Frankenburg, county chairman,
nothing definitely was decided upon
and the matter will be taken up and
thoroughly thrashed out with the busi
ness men either Friday or Saturday.
Interest among the women is al
ready keen on every hand and when
the signal for the big drive is given
they expect to go over the top with
flying squadrons that will have but
one purnose in view, that to oversub
scribe Cochise county's quota and
prove to the rest of America that even
though the signing of peace is near
this section has not yet lost its patriotism.
THOMPSON SHORT Hi
FUNDS, SAYS WITNESS!
i
t
(By Review Lensed Wire)
ALBANY; N. Y., April 15. A sensa-'
tion was sprung at the close of to-,
day's inquiry before the senate judic-!
iary committee into the half million '.
dollar "slush fund" allegations of Sen- i
ator George F. Thompson when Rich-.
ard H. Burke, the man Thompson said
suggested the money, charged the Ni
agara Senntor v.-ith having admitted
he had been "short $15,000 in some
Lockport school or church funds." .
Senator Thompson later said he had ;
ho knowledge of what Burke v.-as talk-!
ing about and that the whole affair!
was one of ' Burke's imagination." j
This development followed denials '
by former Governor Whitman, and !
President Theodore P. Shonts and j
James L. Quackenbush, general attor-l
ney of the Interborough Rapid Transit
company, of Thompson's testimony ;
implicating them in the slush fund j
siory.
The hearing will be resumed tomor

by buying In a developed field and waiting for dividends, but by bringing in a NEW FIELD
your $100.00 investment may jump in 30 days to $50,000.00, but to do this you must take a .
chance; this Is what I am asking 800 others to take with me, and invest $100.00 each, and
YOU ARE NOT TAKING MUCH OF A CHAN CE either, when EVERY OIL EXPERT, and .
GEOLOGIST that has ever visited this-proper ty predicts that it will develop the greatest '
OIL FIELD THE WORLD HAS YET KNOWN.
U. S. Chief Geologist DAVIS WHITE.', at the convention of OIL geologists at DALLAS,
Texas, March 13th. 1919, said "THAT NEW MEXICO WOULD DEVELOP ONE OF THE
BIGGEST OIL' FIELDS IN THE WORLD," and GEOLOGIST end OIL EXPERT R. G. George
says (in-.the El Paso Morning Times of March 14th), "In the TULAROSA BASIN are found
fold3 of rock indicating the existence of reservoirs of OIL and GAS. and in the opinion ot
all OIL GEOLOGISTS. IN THIS DISTRICT THERE EXISTS THE GREATEST OIL FIELDS
ON THIS CONTINENT," this opinion is expressed by Prof. Carrera, who knows every foot
"""of this section, and Frank E. Force, an experienced Oil Geologist, recently from the Wyom- t
InsL'.Oklahoma and Texas Oil Fields, says: ,
"In New Mexico it Is my belief the GREATEST OIL FIELDS THE WORLD HAS YE1
;. KNOWN will be found. I am of the opinion that perhaps the most positive indication of oil
. exists in what is known as 'the TULAROSA BASIN, examinations made by government men
and privately employed geologists have resulted in such a . general agreement as to the
perfect conditions for the existence of oil, that the oil fraternity generally throughout the
country are looking to New Mexico and to the TULAROSA BASIN for the NEXT BIG NEW
PRODUCTION." and my property is in the WRITTENf opinion of CeoloRist S. H. Worrell,
Doan of the Texas School of Mine, THE CREAM of this TULAROSA BASIN. ,
A Pennsylvania company located here years ago,. to drill for oil. but the money panic'
stopped then, and the eminent geologist, C. T. Serle, .when here in 1916, commented on the
WONDERFUL POSSIBILITIES FOR OIL o n this property. - :
Many with small capital who get In on the GROUND FLOOR will make fortunes In
New Mexico Oil, as has been done in other states. ARE YOU GOING TO BE ONE OF THEM
or will you tell hereafter that you lived here during the OIL DEVELOPMENT and did not
get rich because YOU DID NOT HAVE THE NERVE TO TAKE A CHANCE.
' My company will be capitalized for $100,00 0.00. 1000 shares of $100.00 each. I will get
200 for my entire holdings of about 20,000 acres and will agree not to sell these .shares until
oil Is struck. You will have your pro rata Interest In ALL of this, and every well brought In.
I will buy at par a $10,000.00 block of stock to show my confidence in it. It is nearly all sold
and I believe will go to double Its present value in 60 days; buy two shares, sell one, when
the value doubles, the remaining one will then have cost you nothing aud I believe it will
, make you rich.' Liberty Bonds will be taken at their ACTUAL VALUE only. No stock will
. be Issued, for promotion purposes. There will, be no stock salesmen. If we do not strike oil,
an- accounting will, be made, and such money remaining in the treasury will be returned to
each pro rata, my 200 shares will not participate in this refund, but only the $10,000.00
worth I buy at $100.00 each. K " , ' ; ,
The Mowman -Bank & Trust Co. of Las Cruces, N. M., will act as trustee for all money
received and I believe every bank In El. Paso, and where I am known In New Mexico, will
assure their customers that they believe I will honestly carry out every pledge I make. . ,
I will assure all a square deal. There will be no salaried officers.
This well will be sunk or your money refunded.
Nothing runs into money as rapidly as oil it is liquid gold.
