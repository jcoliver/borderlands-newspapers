Chief pf Ordnance, Before
Senate Military Committee,
Says Secretary of "War
Caused Delay In Manufac
turing. (By Review Leased Wire)
WASHINGTON. Dec 13. Mem
bers of the senate military com
mittee today subjected Major
General Crozier, chief of ord
nance, to three hours of sharp cross
examination, seeking explanation of
delays in providing the war army with
weapons. Tomorrow in executive ses
sion, they will press questions waicn
the general objected to answering in
the ooen hearing. S
the open bearing,
Throughout the examination Gener
al Crozier insisted that there bad been
and would be no delay in equipping
soldiers sent abroad. He admitted
that recause of a shortage of machine
guns the American troops in France
were supplied with weapons or l-Tench
make and that there was a lack ot
both machine guns and rifles in the
trainiitg camps, but declared that the
training of troops would not be seri
ously retarded.
Baker Blamed.
Responsibility for the machine gun
situation was placed by the general
squarely upon Secretary Baker, who,
be said, bad taken a personal interest
in the matter and ordered an investi
gation which resulted in the adoption
in June of a new gun known as the
frowning type." This statement
came when Chairman Chamberlain
said he was not satisfied witi the ex
planation that the delay bad been
caused by investigation.
"Neither am I satisfied," responded
the witness, "but 1 am not personally
responsible."
Nearly every member of the com
mittee joined in the examination ana
questions were fired across the table ,
aa rapidly as the general
couia an-
ewer.
Plenty of Money.
Chairman Chamberlain took excep
tion to conclusions drawn from Gen
eral Crozier1 testimony yesterday
that congress, by failing to make
prompt appropriations and labor
troubles were largely responsible for
the delay. General Crozier said be
had not intended such an interpret
tion and that millions of dollars ap
propriated had not been expended.
Rifle Situation.
Delay in supplying rifles, the gen
eral explained in great detail, wtts due
to the factory changes incident to
modification of the British Enfield
type, which large private plants In
this country are equipped to make,
to use American ammunition. Better
rifles are a result, be insisted. He
also said Krag and other types are
now being ent to national army can
tonments and that other production
Is increasing. Detailed statements re
garding prospective deliveries of
rifles he regarded as confidential and
were postponed until tomorrow's exe
cutive session.
Crozier Renominated.
While General Crozier was testify
ing his nomination for another term
as ordnance chief was received from
President Wilson by the senate.
Wheartold of General Crozier's tes
timony, Secretary Baker said the
senate committee was properly seek
ing all information as to what was be
ing done by the war department. He
declined to comment on the statement
as to machine guns further than to say
that the Browning gun was a new
weapon approved by the special boa I'd
he appointed to consider the question
of light machine guns, and that the
entire- capacity of the country for pro
ducing satisfactory weapons is under
.contract.
APPEAL TO PUBLIC

DENVER, Dec. 13. So great was
the Influx of prospective soldiers that
the public was appealed to for shelter
for the men overnight Every down
town rooming house and botel was

tablished at the city and county jails,
and churches were thrown open so
that the visitors might sleep under

from Colorado and Wyoming, but a
large number came from the west

Sets Bunker Coal Prices.
(By. Review Leased Wire)
WASHINGTON, Dec. 13. Export
and foreign bunker coal prices were :
fixed by the fhel administration today
at $1.35 a ton higher than the domes
tic price scale. Heretofore export and
bhnker coal has sold at the figsres set
for sales within the United States.
The new prices will apply to all coun
tries except Canada and Mexico.
The price .increases were allowed,
the fuel administration explained, to
give American producers profits that
have been taken by foreign dealers.
"It has been found," said a state
ment issued tonight, "that selling coai
to foreign ships and for export cargoes

WASHINGTON, Dec. 13. The rail

attention. The president has before
him a mass "of information on the sub-

The senate interstate commerce J

These figures were absed on net

Restrictions Governing the Sale of Sugar
In West Explained and Defended by Letter
Every good citizen and housewife I
shouid read carefully and seriously I
consider the facts in connection with
the ruling of the United States food
administration in regard to sugar. It
Is evident that a great many retailers
as well as a large percentage of the
consuming trade are not familiar with
the conditions surrounding the sugar
business and the couse for restric
tions in the sale of this commodity.
a An actual shortage of sugar existed
in the eastern states and arrange
ments were made by the food admin
istration to supply he eastern sec
tion of the country with the Califor
nia sugar. In past years California
sugar has been marketed almost ex
clusively in the western states. In
order to provide for the eastern states
It became necessary to prevent deal
ers accumulating a eurplus. As soon

HALIFAX, N. S.. Dec. 13. John
Johansen, helmsman on the Nor
wegian steamer Imo, the Belgian
relief ship whose colision with
-the ammunition sfeamer Mont
Blanc led to the disaster of last -Thursday,
was detained as a Ger
man fapy suspect today. He was
turned over to the military author-.
ities by officials of the Massachu
setts relief hospital where he has
been under treatment
One of the nurses at the hospi
tal, a young woman from New
York, whose name was not reveal
ed, yesterday noticed that he pati
ent was acting queerly and thai
he did not seem to be wounded.
Physicians examined the man
and the conclusion was reached
that he was shamming illness.
Later, it was said. Johansen of
fered a nurse $50 if she would go
out and buy him a newspaper, the
. assumptionbeing that he bad in
mind an attempt to escape in her
absence.
Guard Placed.
- After that incident a military
guard was placed on duty by hi
bed. The provost guard was sent
for today and Johansen was lock
ed up.
In connection with the arrest,
the wildest spy rumors heard here
since the war began were spread
broadcast. These culminated in a
report that eight Fermans had
been shot at sunrise. Military
and naval authorities, while ac
knowledging that the Johansen
case was being thoroughly investi
gated, declared the shooting story
was absurd.
Another persistent story was
that a secret code In German had
been found on Johansen and that
a wireless station had been un
earthed in the district destroyed
.by tire after the explosion.
Another Story.
J. C. Burchall. counsel for the
Imo in the admiralty hearing on
the collision of the two vessels,
said tonight that the secret code
story as far as it concerned Johan
sen was absolutely without
foundation. Johanse, Mr. Burch
all said, had been living in the
United States 10 years and as he
was anxious to return to his old
home in Norway, he shipped on
the Imo.

many people assumed that sugar was
also scarce in the west and that as
the sugar beet crop had been harvest
ed and the supplies on the Pacific

As a matter of fact the large Cuban

ary. As soon as this crop comes on
the market the strain will be relieved.
The eastern part of the country will

The rverse side of the card carries
a message to householders. "The
food situation in Europe." it says, is
far graver than when the preliminary
survey of the food supply of the world
for this year was made. We have
an abundance for "ourselves and it is
the policy of the food administration,
by the prevention of experots. to re
tain for our people an ample supply
every essential foodstuff. The har-
ests 'of our allies have proved less
than we had contemplated and the
great curtatlmest of shipping by tbe
submarine during the last few months
has further prevented them from ac
cess to remote markets.
Neutral Have Need
"Beyond tbe demands of tbe allies
is a call upon us by the friendly neu
trals for food and if we cannot at
least in part respond to these neutral
calls, starvation on an unparalleled
scale must ensue.
"Food has taken a dominant position
in the war and we must ask the Amer
ican people to sacrifice far more
than we at first thought necessary.

HE British, French and Italian
lines are still holding firmly
against onslaught of the Teu
tonic allies, delivered with heavy
reinforcements fiat have been drawn
from the Russian front since tbe ces
sation of hostilities thereu ndr the
armistice.
Tbe latest -attack of the Germans,
made In the Cambrai region between
Bullecourt and Queant. was a com
plete failure. Tbe Teuton losses in
men killed and madep risoner are put
in the balance with their small gain
of ground against the British: an
other attack by the German crown
prince in the Caurieres wood on the
Verdun sector, which was delivered
the custory repulse, while in the
highlands of the northern front the
enemy armies are still being held In
check by the Italians.
Operation Extensive
A most expensive operation was the
German attack Wednesday between
Bullecourt and Queant. The Berlin
war office admits that only a few
British shelters and 99 prisoners were
taken, while Field Marshal Halg re
ports that heavy casualties were in
flicted on the enemy all along tbe
front of' the offensive, numerous of
his dead being left before the entan
glements when the impossible task
of piercing the British llr.e became
apparent and a hurried retreat was
ordered.
In Italy
Finding that the efforts of tbe Aus
trian to break th rough the Italian
front adn debouch upon the plain of
Venetia were future, tbe German
j troops under
General von Bealow
their allies and with
! cave inrorceu
them have delivered another power
ful assault between the Brenta and
Piave rivers. At only one point, how
ever, were the combined Teutonic
forces i able to dent the line of the
defenders, on Mont Spinonica, where
they secured a temporary foothold
after having sustained severe t-aatutl-
I ties. Here the Italians are striving
valiantly to retake the lost position.
Snow and mist are hampering the op
erations in this region.
Statements Vary
Reports as to the progress of tbe
operations between the Bolshevik!
and Kaledlnes forces in Russia are
beclouded by reason of variant state
ments of results. Both sides are
credited with' victory in different un
official versions of tbe operations. One
report says Kaledines is besieging
Rostor-on-Don acd that fighting is in
progress in tbe vicinity of that city.
where men and guns from tbe Black
sea fleet are aiding the Bolsheviki.
Another dispatch asserts that General
Korniloff has routed the Pftlsheviki
near Bielgorod. while still other says
that Korniloff has been wounded and
is in danger of capture, and that at
tempts by Kaledines' followers to cut
off the food supplies to the Bolsheviki
in Moscow and Petrograd and from
Siberia has failed.
Submarine a Menace
The German submarine menace is
being held, but has not yet been mas
tered, according to the first lord of
the British admiralty. In a statement
the first lord says the downward trend
of mercantile marine loss, the con- .
struction ot merchant ships and th)
number of enemy submarines that are
being destroyed all are satisfactory.
Another high naval authority say the
German have been attempting a sub
marine offensive of the greatest pos
sible magnitude, but that they have
signally railed and have had to pay a
heavy price in vessels lost at the
hands of the American and entente
naval forces.
Americans Killed
Aerial bomb dropped by the Ger
mans on a town behind the British
front have resulted in the death of a
number of American railway engi
neers. In another town German avia
tors attempted to bomb a marching
American column, but all the men es
caped unscathed, although the missile
exploded dangerously near them.

CHICAGO, Dec. 13. Retention of
the 25 player limit and continuation
of the usual spring training trips was
decided upon at the closing, session
of the" American league meeting to
night. The club owners cleared up
these points in preparation for the
meeting with the National leaguers

club owners of the two leagues are:

was on the Mont Blanc, as It had
been forbidden by the French govern
ment Morning Clear.
The morning of the collision was
clear, the captain continued. While
proceeding up the Bedford ba?jon his
ship sighted the fmo at 8:30 a. m. He
was then about 120 feet from the Dart
mouth shore. The Imo was heading
to sea on the west side but was tak
ing a direction across his course so
that her starboard side was visible.
He gave one short blast of his whistle
to indicate he was goin to the right
The Imo replied by two short blasts.
He thought the Imo. changed her
course though it 'was difficult to de
termine this as she was against the
land.
Imo Had Speed.
He was at this time going to star
board and the Imo to port. He notic
ed later that the, Imo tame a little
more to the left" In the meantime
be stopped his engines The Imo gave
tow short blasts when the ships were
about 150 feet apart The collision
was Inevitable at this point. The Imo,
judging by the force of the collision,
seem-id to have great speed.
The captain said he turned bis ship
to the left and gave two short blasts.
The ships then had each other on the
right side and were 50 feet apart.'
Asked if the vessels would not have
passed at a distance of 50 feet if no
other change was made, the witness
said this was so, as the Imo was travel
ing obliquely up the harbor. The Imo
thens ginalled she was "goin astern
at fuil speed."
Effort .Unsuccessful.
Captain Lam'odey said he saw the
$mo's propeller was" going astern but
she kept ahead.. He then signalled his
engines astern and, put the helm to
starboard so the Imp would not strike
the hold where 'the picric acid as he
kfiew .the impact Vbuld set it on fire.
He wss not successful.
- Abandons Ship. .
The effect of the collision was im
mediate. Thick black 'smoke poured
from the hold- He though the ship
was to be blown up at once. It was
impoasbile to put out the fire. In or
der not to uselessly sacrifice lives he
ordered the crew to abandon the ship.
Perfect order was. maintained. He
gave the order to get away from the
ship and make for the east chore.
He called the role when they landed
and found only one man missing.
Eighteen to 20 minutes elapsed be
fore the explosion.
Last to Leave.
Captain Lamddec added this was
the first time he had ever been in
Halifax harbor. Cross examined by
counsel for the owners of the Imo,
witness said said the Mont Blanc was
not carrying a red flag or anything
to indicate that she had explosives
aboard. He declared the Internation
al ' navigation rules did not call for
flying a red flag except when loading
or handling munitions.' He was not
aware that all munition, ships sailed
with a red flag in peace times. He
was the last man, he asserted, to leave
the ship after the collision.
' Asked If he understood what the
Imo's two blasts meant. Captain Lamo-
dec said he thought she was signalling
wrongly, but as he had signalled his
course first he had no right to change
it except in case of collision. He de
clared the Imo was half a mile away
when be first saw her, that there was
a perceptible interval between the
blowing of the whistles and that the
collison took place immediately after
the Imo signalled she was going
astern. The ship's full speed at the
time was seven and one-half knots.

Restrictions
Governing the
Sale of Sugar
(Continued From Page One.)
20 pounds ruling was put into effect it
is also evident that many peaple have
been buying freqent lots of 20 pounds
and stocking up in anticipation of a
shortage.
People, who are guilty of laying in
excescive stocks of sugar are not ap-1
preciative of the liberal ruling of the
food administration and their motives 1
can be attributed only to selfishness ;
and lack of patriotism. ,
The ruling of the food administra
tion Is extremely liberal insofar as the
western states are concerned and it 1
was pointed out that the restrictions
placed on purchases were merely to
enable the refiners to supply all parts
of the country pending the arrival of
the Cuban sugar. The restrictions on
dealers which prevented their hoard
ing large stocks, has permitted the:
supplying of our allies with sugar. ,
Willful disregard of the instructions j
of the food administration by deaiers
or consumers must eventually lead to
the adoption of drastic measures, such
as have been, imposed upon the people
of European countries.
Some of the methods adopted by the
food administration in conserving food
products are to an extent experiment
al, the people being placed practically
upon their honor. Naturally it these
methods do not prove effective we
can only blame ourselves for future
legislation that might bring about a
condition of actual hardship, 'Instead
of moderate self-denial.
Expect Relief Soon.

NEW YORK. Dec. 13. George M.
Rolph, federal sugar administrator, an
nounced today it was . probable the
sugar shortage here would continue
until the first of the year. Consumers
in tho east are not paying more for
8Uar than those in the west, he said.
While temporary relief might be pro
vided; Mr. Rolph declared, there was
no prospect of filling the market de
mands this month. '
Nine thousand bags of Venezuelan 1
sugar and 11,000 bags of Cuban sugar j
soon will be ready for distribution, it !
was announced by the Intenational -Sugar
Refiners' committee. Distribu-1
tion of seven million pounds of sugar .
was completed here toy, the com-1
mittee said. Licenses of two whole-,

pended by the food board today as '.
penalties for overcharging in sales of;
sugar. The license of Herman Pwor-;

the license of Goldberg & Cohen was j
suspended until January first. The .
dealers were instructed to advertise

day. Saturday night at 8 o'clock, the sec
ond number of the Lyceum and En
tertainment course of the Y. SI. C. A
will appear in the big gymnasium.
A clipping from the press has the
following to say about the attraction:
"The world, especially the American
part of it, is constantly looking for
the new, the startling, the interesting'.
Monday night at the Eugene theatre
was heard a concert which fulfilled all
these requirments and more. Jean
Wormser's Alpine Singers, dressed in
native costumes, made a ai'ost lovely
picture. Their .songs, while rendered
mostly in a foreign tongue, consisted
of the simple, exquisite natural melo
dies, which appeal to hearts the world
over. They were beautifully harmon
ized and sung by -a perfectly drilled
quartet. There was life, spirit, pre
cision, and the incidental acting was
entirely in keeping. Mill! Mayerbofer,
the soprano, has a clear, ringing
voice of the pure bell-like quality, and
seems to possess a robust physique to
carry her through any yocal feat she
attempts with perfect ease. In the echo
ei.oct given behind the scenes che
sustained a high B with telling, sus
taining power and sweetness. Few of
the audience realized the possibilities
of the itither, a limited instrument ex
cept in the hand's of such players. The
soul of the whole company is the ge
nial Jean Wormser, who sang the
comic numbers and received hearty,
encores." This course is for the mem
bers tf the association and W free to
members of the families, and those, af
filiated. ,

"By the help of Tanlac I have over
come troubles I had begun to fear
would end my life," said Mrs. Aline
Ramsey, who resides at 303 South
Pearl street, Dallas, Texas, recently.
"My stomach hs been troubling me
for eight years," she continued, "and
I had gotten to where I couldn't 'even
eat raw egg or drink sweet milk with
out suffering afterwards. At times my
stomach was so gassy and upset that
I coundn't retain a thing. For the
past two years I have had rheumatism
in my right shoulder and arm so bad
I could hardly use my hand. I was so
nervous and miserable I could hardly
sleep at all and coultf do no work
without feeling completely exnausted.
I was badly constipated, had such a
glimmer betore my eyes I could hardly
see and would often get so dizzy I had
to lie down.
"I took nearly every medicine I ever
heard of and tried in vain so long
without getting anything to help me
that I began to think I couldn't get
well. Then my nephew from Georgia
told me about Tanlac and while I
never got much relief from my first
bottle, the second got me to eating
hearty and sleeping fine. I finished
my third bottle with such a big appe
tite that I could hardly get enough
to eat and my stomach trouble and
rheumatism are gone. So now I can
eat what I want, sleep like a child
and am praising Tanlac for my wonder
ful recovery. I firmly believe It has
saved my life and such a medicine is
worth praising."

The latest income tax statistics disclose the fact that

The pacifist has been called the appendix of our na

He needs to be removed because he is a hamper on the
strength of the nation at a time when all its strength
is needed. -

The fame and glory won by the Canadian overseas forces
doubtless had much to do with this great success in se
curing men. As long as the world stands the exploits ol
the Canadians at Ypres. the Somrae and Arras will be
told by the children of men.
Among the silly and wild-eyed performances of the
Bolsheviki leaders In Russia is the blatant statement
that an armistice or permanent peace would be made
only upon terms that no German troops be removed from
the Russian front Name of a name! At the rate of re
moval going on for the past six weeks there will be none
left to move except a corporal's guard here and there
along the line, composed of Landwehr. At least a half
million Germans troops from the Russian front are fight
ing right now in Italy Pid Cambral and Flanders. Any
member of the Bolsheviki caught running at large in this
country would be immediately brought before a probate
judge and tried on an insanity charge.
The church militant is a factor today even as it was
in the time of the crusades. Bishop Adna Leonard of
the Methodist church of California is a man of courage
as well as piety. He dismissed Dr. E. P. Ryland, super
intendent of the Los Angeles district of the church from
his office on the simple but sufficient ground that he is a
pacifist and had declined to join the bishop in his war
program, which included speeches in support of the gov
ernment In its righteous war against the powers of evil,
cruelty and deceit Long live this bishop. May his tribe
Increase. America needs the support of the church in
this war more than she ever needed it before. Every,
factor and every force must be employed to bring our
full strength Into the field.
While local dealers declare that there is no serious
shortage of sugar in our available markets, yet they are
already following instructions and restricting its sale to
twenty pounds to one family a month. Thre are people
who get around this order by buying at different places.
But these people are slackers. Local dealers have also
cut their sale of sugar to candy makers nd those who
brew soda fountain syrups one-half the amount usually
used by these establishments. Bisbee is close to the
Pacific coast and therefor accessible to the beet sugar
and Hawaiian sugar markets. Many eastern cities are
almost sugarless. Letter received here from relatives
and friends in a score of eastern cities declare that they
are not able to buy a pound of sugar on their local mar
kets for weeks at a time.
A second meatless day in each looms near, according
to the food sharps. And hey also want baconless break
fasts every day in the week and some real restrictions in
the use of sugar. ;Well, why not? We eat too much
meat and too much sweet stuff, anyway. This denial is
a small thing in comparison with what our allies have
to do and with what faces our fighting men next sum
mer. Let the second meatless day come. Why should
we tear it when we have the scriptures for authority that
the three Hebrew children who ate pulse alone were
twice as strong, as healthy and as fair as Uie Babylonian
youths who ate meat? if pale bread will make rosy
cheeks, and if rosy beefsteaks make pale checks, then
let our cheeks be rosy still. '
General Maurice, director of English military affairs,
frankly admits that the British line was broken on the
southern flank at Cambral in the German reaction and
forced to fall back with the loss of almost as many guns
and prisoners as General Byng took in that brilliant
drive. This admission bears out the claims the Germans
made at that time regarding prisoners and guns. It is a
sad commentary on what was hailed at the time as the
greatest victory of the war. General Maurice alto stated
plainly that the allied lines in the west were not in
violate. All signs presage a tremendous German offen
sive somewhere in the west. And it may well gain initial
success at least At least a half million American troops
with full complement of artillery and airpranes must be
thrown Into the western battle front to give the allies
the ascendancy they had at the time the Russian armis
tice allowed the big troop movement from the eastern
line.
Recruiting for the regular army is better now than it
was at the outbreak of the war. In Chicago on the last
day during which men subject to the next draft could en
list there were five thousand applications. This was
twice as many as the day previous to the first draft
News from over the country generally Indicate that the
voluntary enlistments during November and the first two
weeks of December were far and away aTwve anything
accomplished during the big enlistment campaign in the
early months of last summer. This nation is waking up
to the task ahead. The signs are very encouraging for
a concerted war action Jin this country that will sweep
the pacifists and traitors into their boles to stay. '
SometrtKng like a 160 years ago Frederick the Great of
Prussia, the father of the present German empire and
German ambitions to rule the world, was beaten at Kun
ersdorf by the Austrians and Russians, and actually con
templated suicide after the disastrous battle. But the
Austrians and Russians, as usual, failed to rollow up their
advantages and the Prussian ruler carried on the war
to a successful conclusion. Frederick had 21,000 men at
Kunersdorf and lost 18.000 in that disastrous struggle.
With only three thousand effective soldiers left as an
army he was allowed to retire to strong positions ane
keep up some opposition to his enemies. Think of it!
Three thousand men left of the Prussian army. The
Prussian king today, after losing millions tn battle, has
probably five million men still under arms. Frederick
the Great was a bandit of the Villa type with his gang
of fighters, compared to the war of today, a century and
a half after he led his three thousand survivors from
that Kunersdorf field.
Tbe capture of Bagdad and Jerusalem from the Turks
' j by tbe British armies constitutes a menace to the Turkish
empire that is not apparent at first in pure military value.
j But in political and sentimental effect these losses to the
J Turk are tremendous. His eastern supply bases and
railroad communications are gone, wnai inerman s
march to the sea meant to the southern Confederacy,
this British march from the Suez canal to the Holy City
means to the Turk. Tbe tribes are rising against him.

. and the Chink has taken Harbin, eastern seaports of
Russia. These occupations, taken with the British suc
cesses, are vital blows to German dreams of power In the
far east and their effect extends clear into the West and
will, affect in the Ion? run, the western battle line.
Hundreds -of millions of dollars' worth of supplies from

This editor Is not an engineer or even an expert on
paving or road work, but common sense and observation
tell him that the City of Bisbee is throwing money away
on road repairing, while the country road repairs are
maria with a view for nermanency. For instance: Tbe
road between the foot of the Bisbee hill and the Johnson
Addition paving gut in on awful bad state a short time
ago, and was repaired by throwing loose dirt and gravel
over the shell holes and depressions. It did very well
for a few weeks, but the wind and the whirling wheels
of traffic have scooped all this loose light covering away
and tbe holes stand out naked and rough as ever at this
time. On the hill and road between Lowell and Baker
vllle the conditions were the same. Tills stretch became
Hp rough it was almost impassible. The county repaired
this road by borrowing It and rolling it. They removed
tbe holes and depressions and left a level road that gets
oetter instead of worse under the weight ana friction
of traffic. Road'repair work and money are thrown away
unless the work is done right Funny thing that a road
expert should try to repair a road by throwing loose dirt
over the holes. There is only one way known to man
to really improve a road, and that is by dragging It until
it is smooth, aud crowning It slightly and then packing
it with the roller. Why the city should keep on wasting
money on flimsy and foolish road repair work is past
the comprehension of ibis editor man and about seven
citizens who have discussed the matter with him lately
over his battered desk.

BUILDING PROGRAM AT
UNIVERSITY WILL
GO Oil AS PLANNED
Dr. von KleinSmid, president of the
University of Arizona, upoa returning
from a trip through the east stated
to the student body that the building
program on which the university has
been working for the past year will bo
completed according to the plans orig
'nally outlined.
Between the time of planning the
new $175,000 mining building, $100.
000 of which was donated by the min
ing companies of the state, to the
dissent the cost of labor and mate
rials has increased from 30 to 60 per
cent, and while the building was
originally designed to cost $175,000.
it mas evident that it could not be
rnnmleted within that amount The
mlninz companies of the state de-
afred tn see that the buildlne was
finished without cuttine down either
the size or quality, and have guaran
teed the necessary amount u com
plete the construction.
The placing of the mines ana engi
noprlncr hn ildine reoulred the razing
of the old shops, necessitating a new
and modern shop building and euip
T.ent, the money for, which was also
donated, according to the recent an
nouncement of the mining companies.
In speaking to tbe student noay re
earding the matter. Dr. von Klein
Smid said:
It is not unknown to y?u that It
costs nowadays to build about 60 per
cent more than it would have cost
two years ago. The , University of
rlzona is in the midst of a building
campaign. There has been pressure
brought to bear for a year to delay
our building program, and the atti
tude is justified in a great measure.
There are some things, however,
which we cannot do, and one of these
is. that we cannot replace shops
which are torn down, and we cannot
hold laboratory classes in the open
air even in the sunny southwest.
Some kind of housing has to be pro
vlded.
It seems best everything consid
ered. and in view of the fact that
much of our material was bought be
fore the war was brougnt on, 10
complete the building as soon as pos
sible. However, even in the south
west, we do not pick money off from
hushes, and it was necessary for me
to tell a very pleasant story to some
of our good friends in tne east, wno
are interested in us and who sympa
thize with us in the' condition which
we are and other institutions at this
time find themselves. In other words.
verv safe martin with which we
were to complete our mines and en-
Elneerlng building went glimmering
with the declaration of war. We do
not believe in building that which we
would not be able to pay ror. ui
"rurse, we could always cut down, if
nprpRRnrv and the attitude of the in
stitution has been that we must do
hat sort of thing. However, if we
could get more funds, we would get
them. My trip to New York was to
see whether or not the way might
he opened for us to go ahead and
f-omplete the building called for in
he original plans. Well, we can.
"I cannot tell you In dollars and
cents I wish I knew myself but our
ood friends are going to see us
through with this proposition.
"Thev themselve are not Dunaing.
The rrent enrnnratlons who are inter

anything for themselves. Yet in tne
face of that handicap, and a time
when these corporations have been

coal mines are taxed to the limit of
their capacity to fill the deniaads made
by the approach of winter and. the re
quire.neat of the various industries
which are using a maximum supply.
It is not due to a decrease in produc

the recent lat'or troubles which have
passed, the yield of the mines is all
parts of the country is greater than
ever before, but to the unprecedented
demand. It is practically impossible,
he said, for the mines greatly to add
to their present production because
there is no prospect of them obtaining
the necessary labor to do so, but when
spring comes it is expected that the
mine output will be more equal to all
the needs. He has been in : every
town and city in Arizona on his trip,
and says he found prosperity and pat

Save a Life for Christmas
Our FrencJi comrades have been steadily sweeping fcack the enemy
by concentrating in one spot more guns and larger guns than the
enemy could gather there. After a furious bombardment of the enemy
trenches the French Infantry sweeps forward, gaining trench after
trench with very little loss of life.
We must provide for. our American army guns greater in size and
greater in number than the enemy can oppose to them. It will save
many of the million American boys just entering the conflict.
Save a life for Christmas by helping to buy one of these great
guns. Give United States War-Savings Certificates instead of gold
pieces for Christmas gifts. They cost $4.12 each in December. They
are little five-year United States Government Bonds, bearing 4 com

and on Christmas morning they will have the evidence that in their
respective names help has been given towards preserving perhaps
i some American boy spared for many Christmas Days. And yon will
, be, giving as a Christmas present the safest, best investment In the
world today something better than gold. ,

The process of heating water for domestic purposes has been rev- f
olutionized in the past few years through the introduction and
perfection of gas fired water heaters, until today it is no longer a
a problem to secure an abundance of hot water quickly and econo
mically, in any dwelling, large or small.
Today, in the countless thousands of homes where gas fired water heaters are in
stalled, an abundance of hot water is available for any purpose. By some types of beat
ers the water is heated instantly at the turn of a faucet, by others, within a few min
utes after lighting the heaters, and all without labor, inconvenience or discomfort, md
at a reasonable cost for gas.

rates for call and time loans.
Virtually all call money was placed
at 6 per cent and time funds were ex
tremely scarce, though quotably
changed.
The so-called Harrtman and Ift'll
issues, as well as other standard rails
were .numbered among the day's new-
low records, with numerous indus
trials and specialties.
rnited States Steel was hammered
down to 79, within a fraction of its
minimum for two shears, in the last
hour, but met with good support, ral
lying almost 2 points, and closing at
81. Other leaders benefited by the
rebound in steel. Sales 780,000
shares. Bonds continued to yield
Liberty 4's varied slightly at 97.38 to

GRAIN MARKET -
CHICAGO, Dec. 13. Corn showed
firmness todav. largely because of
storms interfering with the crop
movement. Prices closed steady at
the same as yesterday's finish to 4c
hipTipr -with January Sl.21 and
May $1.19. In oats the outcome
fanPil fmm i declined to lie ad
vance. Provisions underwent a set
hark of 22 cents to SI.
Knowledge that traffic difficulties
had become acute needed no greater
evidence than the unusual scantiness
of corn receipts. On the ensuing ad-rim-ember
touched $1.25 a
bushel, the l igh point on the crop.
Then profit 4akmg set in and me
market tended to sag.
Oats mounted to a new high price
record for the season. Bad weatfter
gossip of large export business were
mainly responsible. Heavy selling in
the last part or the "day wiped out
most of the gains.
Sharp declines in the hog market
pulled down provisions.

Stielow CaseIs
Brought Before
New York Court
(By Review Leased Wire)
ALBION, N. Y., Dec. 13. Erwin
King was arrested today, charged with
murder in the first degree on informa
tion by C. E. Waite, an assistant at
torney general or the state. King is
accused by Mr. Waite of the murder of
Charles Phelps and Margaret Wolcott,
for which Charles F. Stielow, seven
times granted a stay of execution by
Governor Whitman is serving a life
sentence.
Justice Dudley directed a plea of
ntt guilty. King was then taken be
fore the grand jury, which is investi
gating the Phelps murder and the cir
cumstances leading to the conviction
of Stielow and his nephew. Nelson
Green. King was- before the Jury an
afternoon. .
"I'll tell them everything," the
horse trader and peddler said as he
walked into the room. No indictment
has been reported.
The special prosecutors named by
the governor said this afternoon that
King would tell the grand jury that
the first confession he made at Little
Valley is the truth. In it he said that
he and Clarence T. O'Connell. who
now is in Auburn for shooting a Catta
ragus, N. W., storekeeper, bad com
mitted the murder. King later repu
diated that confession.
A special prosecutor will continue
the grand jury proceedings, taking up
an inquiry Into the means by which
Stielow and Green made confession of
the double murder.
"There will be some sensational dis
closures," said Mr. Waite.

were favorites of former generations. .
Times have changed radically. Col- 1 1
leges and clubs have been established for the I
express purpose of determining just which baking method
and baking materials are best. (
Many domestic scientists devote their j
Jives to research and experimental work. They
are constantly testing food products. They conduct exhaus
tive comparative t?rs. They accept and endorse only such
methods and balir.j processes as have been found superior
through scientir.c r.csurement of merit. These decisions
are given wide p-JA'.:'..;. The result is that the housewife of
today produces tr.on wholesome and perfect bakings at less
cost than ever befors.
I have conducted many experiments
and have investigated experiments conducted by
scores of other domestic scientists. My own work and the
decisions handed down by other pur 3 food specialists and
domestic scientists bring cut tho evidence that the over
whelming majority c.nplcy tnd advocate tli2 use of one special
brand of baking powder which proves once more the old
saying that "there ic only one btst.
J know that this baking powder has
won its popularity among experts on merit
alone. Because I know that they show no partiality. To ob
tain their approval a product must possess superiority. And
that superiority must cover every phase of baking powder
quality of matcrij end action. It must be absolutely sure in
results never fail. It must be perfectly pure leave no harm
ful residue b the foods. It must produce the boat grade of
bakings csbcz, biscuits, etc, thct ar2 liht, tender and tasty. ,
Finally i: must be a baking powder that is economical in
both coct and use.
Calumet Baking Powder is the one
baking pewder that has won the verdict of
superiority ard the hearty endorsement of expert domestic
scientists who like n:ysclf have proved Calumet's super
excellence beyond dispute. This superiority "sanctioned" as it
is by eminent domestic science authorities certainly clearly in
dicates that Calumet gives the hor.scwife the greatest of
Baking Powder value.
