ACTION CLEARS UP
' EXEMPTION PUZZLE
Local Boards Directed to Facil

ance of All Men Ready to
Serve Nation. .
(By Review Lease Wire).
WASHINGTON, August 6v The
ranks of the new national army were
opened formally today to friendly al
iens as volunteers. A ruling by Provost-Marshal
General Crowder com
municated to the local selection boards
directs that all such aliens who waive
their right of exemption on national
ity be promptly accepted for service.
Ccneral Crowder sent this telegram
to the governors:
"Reports reaching this office recent
ly indicate that in, some quarters the
belief prevails that friendly aliens
who have not declared their Intention
to become citizens but are ready and
willing to serve, are disqualified from
entering the military service of the
United States and therefore that they
must take out first papers before they
can te" accepted. It is to be regretted
that such a misunderstanding should
have arisen. The qualifications for
voluntary enlistment In time of war
are no more restricted for service in
the new national army than for tha
regular army. Such alien non-declarants
are virtually volunteers.
Aliens Are Welcomed..
"The selective service act prodded
for their registration; but it did not
regard them as being under any lia
bility to service and it therefore gave
them full liberty to claim exemption
when called by local boards. Now
that information reveals their willing
ness in large numbers to decline thi6
exemption and to accept service in
this war against the common enemy
of our civilization, it should be fully
understood that their service is hear
tily welcomed, and they should be ac
cepted whenever upon summons they
fail to claim their right of exemption.
"They are 'assisting the cause of
their own country by aiding the United
States to triumph in this war. The
more of them that enter the service
the better, for in this way will be re
moved the cause of dissatisfaction
heard in some quarters, that, although
the quota was based on total popula
tion including aliens, the actual draft
reached only citizens and declarants.

"Local beards were directed to facll-
It ate in every way the acceptance of
friendly alien non-declarants for mil

to do their share to assist the country
which has given them a refuge and
an honorable living."
General Crowder's office also Issued
inrtructions to guide registered men
either at officers' training camps or
who have applied for admission to the
second series of tffese camps which
will open this month.
The instructions to local boards di'
rect that where a candidate at train

for physical examination, he may pro

Senator Chamberlain, the adminis

SENATE COMMITTEE
FAVORABLY REPORTS
. WAR TAX MEASURE
'(Continued From Page One)
excess profits your committee kept
constantly in mind the fact that the
amount of revenue derived from these
sources would depend upon the pros
perity and activity of business and
that to impose taxes which would de
pend upon the prosperity and actiV'
ity of business and that to impose tax
es which would tend to discourage en
terprise and dampen these activities
would tend to defeat the legislative
purpose. Moreover, it thought that if
the rates upon incomes and excess
profits were fixed at the highest level
there might be tut little margin left
tor further increases in rates."
The report defends the elimination
of the Ro-callod Lenroot surtaxes on
incomes of over $40,000 added in the
house, resigned to raise $66,000,000 as
follows: ,
In view of the fact that in addi
tion to the large Increase in the nor
mal tax and surtaxes upon incomes,
the bill provides for a large increase
In the war profits tax of corporations
and partnerships and Includes Individ
uals in the scope of that tax, and in
vie wof the probability that it will be
necessary hereafter to further in
crease these rates in order to provide
for increased war expenditures, your
committee believes that for the pres
ent it is inadvisable to increase the
surtax rates beyond those proposed In
the original house bill."
Higher Taxes Expected.
This tax seemed in principle both
morally and economically unsound. In
comes of the last year have paid
their taxes and the balance has either
been spent or saved and added to cap
ital, in which form it will yield re
turns in the ensuing years. To tax
this tax- paid income again is not only
double taxation of a peculiar obnox
ious kjnd but would possibly compel a
tax payer to impair his capital and
thus diminish government sources of
taxation. It would be one of those
disturbing taxes which would alarm
business and check industrial produc
tivity. It is very poor economy and
would hold out a threat of uncertain
ty." ,"
In recommending the graduated war
profits tax upon individuals as well as
corporations in lied :of the present
eight per; cent excess profits law,' the
committee said its plan is similar' to
that of European countries, where it
has had marked success. ;

son why .Individuals engaged in trade

this tax '(.war profits) as well as cor

the present law, the report stated, in
flated values to patents and trade
marks and watering of corporations'
stocks makes evasion of the revenue
law possible, while the committee's
new basts is believed to meet the sit
uation. Senator Simmons also polntea
out that the ne wplan is a war profit?
ta rather than a nejecess profits levy.

. "In addition to thii" the report said
"your committee cafsee no intrinsic
reason why. In this present emergency
the government should not impose, a

rates on first and scond class mail
are increased." : -t.
The house five pet cent taxes npo:,
electricity, gas and local telephone ser
vice were eliminated because "it ap
peared to the committee that C' tas
would fall with very ;reat severity up
on the people of moderate means a;;
well as the poorest classes, who at the
present .time depend very largely In
the cities upon gas; or electricity to
furnish them with bdth light and hea
for cooking as well as, in many cases,
with power for running small machtn

The committee felt that a tax of thia
character ought not to be imposed
unless a point was Reached where it
would become necessary to tax every
thing susceptible to taxation. Light
and heat are the very last ' things
which should be subject to taxation.
For similar reasons, the committer
recommended that the tax upon charg

be eliminated. - j .-. ,

quarter pint of the most wonderful
lemon skin Softener and complexion

two fresh lemons into a bottle con
taining three ounces of orchard white.
Care should be taken to strain the
juice through a fine cloth so no lemon j
pulp gets in, then this lotion will keep
fresh for nAmths. Every woman knows
that lemon juice is used to bleach and
remove such blemishes as sallow ness,
freckles, and tan and is the ideal skin
softener, smoothener and beautifier.
Just try it! Get three ounces of
orchard white at any pharmacy and
two lemons from the grocer and make
up a quarter pint of this sweetly fra
grant lemon lotion and massage It
daily into the face, neck, arms and
hands. It naturally should help to

Enjoy Sunday Contest
In a free hitting contest filled with
errors and brilliant plays, the C. & A.
team defeated the .Seventeenth cav
alry at the Warren Park Sunday bo
fore a large and bappy crowd of fans.
Hall, who started the game for the
soldiers, was batted out of the box
In the first three innings and gave way
to Rob!son, who held the miners to
five runs, one of them earned, in the
last five innings. . But at that. Hall
was more sinned against than sinning.
Twelve large, fat, fruitful errors did
the soldiers make during their boot
less drive upon Verdun. Their left
fielder was the busiest man-at-arms
during1 the fray, anywhere belween
the Mevican' border and the Yser bat
tle line. Ralls that he did not mufT he
fumbled, and those he did not fumble
went between his legs like an X-ray
through a cheese.
Janssen starred in the field for the
Mule Mountain Maulers and Cothran
at the bat.
Gait, hurling for the C. & A., was
on the firing hill for the first time in
two years. He pitched a good game
in spots. It was either a feast or a
famine with him. He fanned 'em in
clusters or he turned and watched his
fielders chase the bingles. But be
had bis nerve and his coolness and
his smile, even if his arm was not as
supple and cunning as it used to be.
The game was marred at the close
by a wrangle over a decision on a
close play at third base. ' The soldiers
had taken a big brace in the eighth
and stormed the first and second line
trenches and were in close distance
of what the miners had thought their
impregnable third line. In the ninth,
with three runs to tie and four to win,
the soldiers had a man on second with
one out. The runner made a dash for

p.rrlved at the -dugout at the same
time. "Safe," signaled the soldier um
pire from the field. "Yer out." an
nounced the civilian umpire from be- i
hind the bat. Then both teams went )
Into a session that resembled the con-.
gressional debate on the food control I
bill. While the rules clearly hold that j
the field umpire makes all decisions
on the bases. It was stated that it was
agreed upon before the game that the
umpire behind'the bat should make de
cisions at third, the field umpire from
his station in short right field, being
too far away to make any hairline de
cisions except with the aid of field
glasses.
From the grandstand it looked like
the soldier had gained the safety zone
ahead of the bomb thrower's effort. Be

have ordered him to duty at the train

be give nthe board involved on its
quota under the draft.
When the candiate has been com
missioned before being called by the
board, he is required to file certificates
showing his status and also an appli
cation for exemption on the ground
that he is already in the military ser
vice, n that event he is exempted but j
does not figure in the credit account
of his district.
Regarding Alimony.
There was some discussion today as
to the status of divorced men who are
paying alimony, t has been" suggested
that in some cases the former wives
of such men are solely dependent upon
the alimony paid and the removal of
the men would work hardship upon
them. No specific request for a rul
ing has been received' but it is remark
ed as probable that if the question is
raised the same -rule that applies to
all other discharges for dependents
would fit the case. It is not the pur
pose of the government to work hard
ships on any dependent by taking
away a bread winner. If the $25
month which a soldier can spare from
bis salary will provid eadequately for
his borne responsibilities, however, he
will not be released from military ser
vice, so each case must be considered
on its merits.
Efforts of Carranzlsta agents now in

sent out by the I. W. W. and their sympathizers that the
famiiesl of tiie deported men had been either mistreated
or were in destitute circumstances.
The emissary of the war department was afforded
every opportunity to make a thorough investigation. Of
ficers and members of both the Protective and Loyalty
leagues co-operated with him cordially, cheerfully and
whole-heartedly in every way. Every good citiien of
this district was migiity giaa tutu uie guvernmem muie
this move.. Now it will have the facts, gathered by a
trained Investigator whose disinterestedness cannot be
questioned' and whose statement of facts will carry con
viction to the nation at large as well as to his govern
ment i
Silly falsehoods and malicious lies have been circu
lated by these deported loafers and agitators without re
gard to anything but their distorted Imaginations. Only
a few of these men had any savings. The fact is, their
families have been better fed as a result of their deporta
tlon than they would have been had these men been left
here. They had no visible means of support. They had,
of their own accord, left good Jobs at good pay, and re
fused to work. Already the pinch of hunger was being
felt in the families of the foreigners before that deporta
tion morning. Unfailing patience, politeness and kind
treatment have been accorded the families of all deported
men. Every family has been provided for, and generous
ly, that has asked for aid that could be reached by an
effective and active organization for that purpose.
The falsehoods about destitution here were circu
lated with a deliberate purpose. The wobblles were
seeking sympathy. They had gone too far In their career
of crime, anarchy and treason, and they knew It. The
blow Bisbee dealt them was as sudden as it was effec
tive. Completely overawed, frightened at public indigna
tion over their lawless methods and organized campaign
against all industry, these men sought to cover their ugly
and unclean past with the garments of martyrs. Hence
their hypocritical appeals: hence their whining falsehoods
about the families they had refused to work for and t
provide for long before the deportation.
Their anxiety about these families is ill-timed. They
cared nothing whether they were provided for when they
went on a strike that had neither cause, principle or union
labor behind it But now they worry over them night and
day.
Bisbee has cared for all these families. Every citi
zen and business man of the district is paying his pro rata
assessment cheerfully to care for them. Even though the
price he high It is worth any price to rid the district
of a thousand or more red flag enemies of the industry
upon which the life of this community depends.
Again the Review repeats, Bisbee was glad to' have
Captain Palen come and investigate these wild and ab
surd charges. The Review claims that there are no
kinder, finer, fairer, more generous, humane citizens in
the world than those who are proud to live in this beauti
ful valley where the wind from the high places stings tho
face and brightens the eye and thrills the heart No
women or children will ever be allowed to lack all the
comforts of life here. No good American citizen but
that is welcome. No workman who wants to work but
that can find work here at higher wages than he can
make for his labor anywhere in the wide world.
We await Captain Pakn's report with that calm faith
and confidence that every man or set of men always have
when they know they are in the right
One of the miners at Globe who went out on strike
and one of the five hundred strikers who openly defied
the I. W. W. and the Austrian leaders and signed up last
week to go back to work, delivered himself as follows on
the whole proposition: "1 have a boy in the navy. Am
I going to stand here and let that boy and his com
panions run out of shells Just because an Austrian with
a dozen alleged Americans, scoundrels and traitors, get
pay every day to talk us and flim-flam us Into staying
from the work that would get out the copper to make thj
shells ,to defend the kid and our country? Do I want
the blood of that kid and hundreds of others, yes, of
many thousands, on my head? I guess not, and I'm
damned If I will. Tell theni to stay out of my road when
the whistle blows again. Get me?"
THE KAISER IN A NEW LIGHT.
Louis Raemakers, the famous Dutch cartoonist, re
cently landed upon these shores, discusses the kaiser in
a new and most interesting light. He declares that
Wilhelm, upon whom we have placed the terrible blame
of the World War, is nothing but a weak tool of his war
mad, arrogant, blindly rushing countrymen. Raemakers
says:
"There seems to be an idea that all that is bad in
Germany is summed up in the kaiser; that if the kaiser
were to be assassinated or to abdicate today It would
be well with the world tomorrow. That is very silly.
"The kaiser is the tool, the dupe of those about him.
He is a child. Let him believe himself the all-wise and
the all-powerful and he is clay in the hands of cleverer
men. He Is content with the shadow. The substance
is elsewhere. You know what his father said of him to
Bismarck. 'Look out for Wilhelm,' he told Bismarck.
'He Is as stupid as he is square-headed. He is a religious
bigot and a hopeless egotist'
"If all the Hohenzollern dynasty should die today
and Scheidemann or even Llebknecht should become
president of a German republic tomorrow, it would not
alter Germany. Germany is an idea. The modern Ger
man has been so insistently and methodically taught
that he is a superman, chosen by God to Impose his
will on the heart and he never doubts it The German
Socialist Is no exception There is only one way to reach
the modem German. Beat him over the head. He un
derstands nothing else. The world must go on beating
him over the head until he says 'enough.' Otherwise,
the world can never live with him.
"Germany never has made any secret of her philos
ophy or her Intentions. Always she has been as frank
as egotists always are. I have been sighting the German
idea more than twenty years. A generation ago I saw
as everyone who cared to see did, what pan-Germanism
nd the rest of the program was leading to. ,In fact, Ger
many told us what it would lead to. When Bismarck
said that France must be crushed, he did not mean that
Germany had a special feud with France, or that unless
France was crushed Germany must perish; but that
France stood between Germany and England, and after
England, the rest of the world.
"I am not an anti-German fanatic! My mother was
a German. I was born within seven miles of the German
frontier. Most of my friends before, the war were Ger
mans. 1 can understand, too, how many good citizens
there must be among your German population. These
Germans who came here in 1848 and in 1864 and immedi
ately after the Franco-Prussian war are a different breed
from the Prussian superman. j
WHY CONFER?
(Phoenix, Arizona, Gazette.)
In the face or the threats and other intimidations be
ing constantly made by the I. W. W.'s and their leaders
WHY CONFER?
. It will be the part of good sense to arrest and prose
cute. Just ask Attorney I. W. W. Moore if he will advise
his followers to do all in their power to harvest the
crops; Jlf he will advise them to obey the law of the land
and be loyal supporters of the president of the United
States and our government
Already there has been too much conferring and
conciliation. John McBride, the federal arbitrator, re
ported last evening that leaders of the I. W. W.'s told
him that they would not agree to return to work on any
sort of an agreement even for one week, one day, one
hour or one minute,, because they wanted their strike to
become a national movement
What can be more treasonable than those words said
to McBride, yet L W. W. Moor? wants to confer with the
state officials. ,
Governor Campbell, this is no time to confer with
such men. On the contrary, ask Moore if he endorses
the statement made to McBride by the I. W. W. leaders
and if he does have hkn arrested and prosecuted as a
traitor to this government

It is either the army or Jail for the slacker. Uncle

that will bring them out oV their holes. The longer they

whence he came.
The state of New Mexico was
threatened with an invasion of the In-
dustrial Workers of the World, tne ob
ject being to close 'flown the coal
mines of the state, which would, in
turn, force the closing down of the
copper mines and smelters of Arizona,
nn4 seriously cripple the railroads.
The' people and the newspapers of that
state were quick to realize the Import'
ance of keeping the mines running.
and there seems to have been an al
most unanimous decision to keep
them running. The State record, of
Santa Fe, says:
No Time For Theories.
"This is no time to experiment
with the theories of the bonehead poli
tician or officeholder. The mine
owners of the southwest know these
men, and they have them on the out
side now, where they can do no dam
age. If the government must have
copper the proper thing to do is to
chase off every foreign enemy and
make it possible for the mines to re
sume production with some assurance
of continued operations and compara
tive safety for lives and property.
"The loyal American people of Ari
zona are seeing 10 u mai iue mine
owners receive the necessary support
to enab'e them to. resume operations
with loyal forces, in order that the gov
ernment may never be short of cop
per for the purposes of war, and the
same condition may be depended up
on in New Mexico if It becomes neces
sary for the people to act"
Mexicans Are Loyal.
The Spanish-American newspapers
take the situation much more serious
ly than do the English publications,
and are irtuch more positive in their
demands for drastic action. La Voz
del Pueblo, of Las Vegas; La Revista
Ilustrada, of Santa Fe; El Defensor
del Pueblo of Socorro, and La Estrel-
la, of Las Cruces. admittedly the lead
ing Spanish-American 'newspapers of
the state, are together in urging that
every precaution be taken to- prevent
a shut d6wn of a single day. They,
are particularly bitter against the. In
dustrial Workers of the World and
seem unable to understand why the
government should permit anything
like the happenings at Globe, Bisbee
and other places. The reported 'beat
ing of an American miners by Aus
trians seems: to have enraged them to
a man. They argue that it would be
disgraceful for them to send their
sons to the front, as they are doing,
and then permit thCir lives to be tak
en by the falure of those at home to
protect the mines, the manufacturers
and the railroads needed to supply
them with things necessary to win
the war. When a strike was threat
ened at Cerillos, a New Mexican coal
camp with a large Spanish-American
element, leaders went there and ex
plained the situation to the men. The
result was the adoption of a resolu
tipn declaring against any strike un
til after the war was settled.
, Ready For Action.
The Spanish-Americans of New
Mexico are a very different people
from the Mexicans of old Mexico.
History shows them . to have held
themselves aloof from the many revo
lutions before the American-Mexican
war, permitting their officials to do
all the revolting they wanted to, by
themselves, but gurnishtng no troops
THE FOOD BILL "HELP 1 HELP!!
. A striker from the Globe-Miami district was in Hibc?
one day last week. Some one. asked him why lie went
on strike. "For a living wage," he replied. "How do
you live while you are not working?" asked the Bislice
man. "From money I saved wfiile at work," replied the
striker before he thought

. When the border trouble came on
they were for an immediate invasioa

and volunteered for the purpose.
They are uncompromising enemies of
the Mexicans, expecting no quarter.
They are deeply interested in. the war
with Germany, and in registering for
the draft made a record by refusing to
put in exemption claims excepting in
case of necessitq. They are convinc
ed that the Industrial Workers of the
World are enemies of theirs because
they seek to do things which will
cause this government embarrassment
and their membership in the stat"
legislature will vote the governor any
drastic measure for the supression
of disturbers of tha peace at this time
They approve of the act Inn of the peo
ple of Bisbee, and will probably take
all the action necessary themselves. If
the conditions require it.
Military experts have recently agreed that NOW is
the time to rush troops to France. The submarine menace
may get better, arid again it may get worse. It has bc-n
demonstrated that troops can be transported across seas
now. And so the plan has apparently been agreed upoa
to try to send 100,000 men a month to Pershing.

Warren District Is Thanked
For Tribute to 0. P. McRae
By Relatives of Deceased
The following letter was received
by The Review yesterday from Joseph
A. McRea of Salt Lake City, a brother
Of the late Orson P. McRae, w ho was
Eliot and killed in this city June 12
while assisting in the drive on dis
loyalty and treason:
Editor Bisbee Daily Review:
Dear Sir I have just received from
my brother, John K. McRae, copy of
your paper containing the account of
our brother Orson's funeral. In be
half of taat part 'of the family not
present on the occasion of my broth
er's burial, I desire to thank your pa
per and the good people of the Warrn
district for the signal honors shown
Orson Pratt McRae. I thank you for
the kindly sentiments spoken of him.
I am glad if he merited J.he eulogies
expressed by your paper and also by
your citizens. 'It is a satisfaction to
us to know that he died in the dis
charge of his duty.
In his loyal defense of your commun
ity he did but express the teaching ot
a worthy parentage. His family were
early pioneers of the territory of Arl
zona (1877). They settled on the San
Pedro before Bisbee sprang into exist
ence. They saw the rise of the ob
scure territory to a place in the galaxy
of states and her "day star" placed
on the glorious emblem of liberty.
My bi'Jther comes from a race of
patriots who know no other ensign
save the banner which waves "o'er the
land of the free and the home of the
brave.
He has five brothers living, who are
ready and willing to give their lives.
if need be, for the defense ot right.
We have all been taught to love that
grand old flag and the institutions it
stands tvr.
Thank you, good people; Tor the
monument you design erecting. You
are building better, perhaps, that you
know, for generations yet unborn will
point to that monument as a fitting
tribute to an act of royalty and their
lives will thereby be influenced for
nobler and kindlier deeds.
Yours truly, .'

NO CLUE TO CRIMINAL
WHO DROPPED ROCK
DOWN JUNCTION SHAFT
Narrow Escape of Eight Men
in Junction Shaft Saturday
Night Attributed to Manner
in Which Boulder Was
Thrown.
Though every enOrt is being exert
ed no clue has at yet been found ot
the man or men who, on Saturday
night, dropped a boulder weighing 14(
pounds down the Junction shaft while
tne pumpmen were coming off shift
and were being brought to the surface.
Feeling is rife against the perpetrators
of the crime.
That a crime was Contemplated and
figured out in advance is clearly shown
by circumstances surrounding the en
tire affair.
The pump men come off shift be
tween 10 and 11 o'clock at night, tor
one of the shifts, and it was while the
cage was ascending from the l&Oo
level that the rock crushed down the
shaft. It would have been impossible
for a rock to be thrown from ay ot
the levels while the shifts were going
on or coming off for, at such times, the
stations are crowd'd with men.
It has been determined that the
boulder was thrown from the 14i0
level of the mine. The shaft is con
creted from the surface. The stations
are also concreted. If die boulder had
been thrown from the surface and had
been dropped into the middle of the
shaft, which is true to plumb, it
would not have hit the side until after
it bad crashed into the top of the cage
and, probably, killed ait of the occu
pants. As it was the first sign of the rock
was located abOut 25 feet below the
1400 level. It would appesr as though
some one had stood on the station at
that point and heaved the rock into
the shaft. It struck on the opposite
side from the station landing and then
bounced back and forth until it struck
the side of the rising cage and nar
rowly missed the eight men who were
being brought to the surface.
More than remarkable was the es
cape from the accident -of the men.
Should the rock have been dropped
from a greater distance and directly
down the shaft its momentum might
have torn the cage from the rope Or
would have undoubtedly broken it up
so badly as to injure, if not kill, all of
the occupants. In such a case it is
doubtful whether or not the exact
cause would have ever been known
Added care is being exercised by the
operators to prevent a repetition of
Saturday night's occurrence and eA ery
agency possible is being, utilized to
apprehend the perpetrator of the
crime.
MINING WRITER TELLS
HOW COCHISE COUNTY
FIRST GOT ITS NAME
L. H. Davis, Resident of
Tombstone in the Early
Days, Recounts Interesting
Conversation Relative to
Naming County.
How Cochise county got its name
was Interestingly told by a visitor in
Phoenix several days ago, L. H. Davis,
mining editor on the El Paso Times,
and well known in Bisbee.
Davis is one of the pioneers of Ari
zona, having lived in Arizona in his
younger days. It was while he was
In Tombstone about the year 1S80 that
a committee met in4 Davis' office to
consider the. naming 'of the new county
which formerly had been a part of
Pima county. Davis graphically de
scribed the atmosphere ot the place
when the committee gathered on tnis
auspicious occasion.
"There we sat in this little office,"
said Davis, in a reminiscent manner.
"and none of us had much of an idea
as to what to call the new county. Well
sir, up stands Harry Woods and ad
dressed the committee with the power
of an orator. He told how the most
unheard of name had been' wished on
our town. Tombstone, and how be was
going to watch it with a name just as
famous, a name that was kn'own all
over the west. And then he announced
his choice ot , 'Cochise,' chief of tne
Apache tribe. '
"Well, you could have knocked the
committee over with a feather. They
asked me for an opinion, but I hadn't
thought of a name and so I said that
Cochise suited me, and it was a fit
ting tribute to the old warrior chief,
who had now laid down his arms and
was engaged in peaceful pursuits.
There was little talking and as we
thought the matter over we came to
the conclusion that Cochise was as
good a name as any, and so she stood."
Davis then reverted back to some ot
the incidents ot the early daysof the
wild times with lawles men and the
Opportunities that lay on every side.
Davis is making a tour of the state,
particularly around the Weaver dis
trict, where he has some gold mining
Interests. While on his journeys he
will gather up material for -the big
annual edition of the Times, which is
planned to go on the press some time
In the fall.

ground that the government in its

not adopt a drastic altitude.
The excess profits tax in its pres

pointed out by many that if the state
ments of earning for the second quar

that company made liberal allowance
for taxation and still forecasts a big

Is any criterion of what other con
cerns will show, then it is logical to
assume the shares of many of the in
dustrial companies are in a more or
less stable position, unless of course,
a price fixing program Is inaugurated
that will materially impair net results.
Of course there are other influences
that must be considered especially at
this time, namely, the Russian situa

serve the "liberty and freedom which
this country has enjoyed for over 140
year3."
"When you see the legally elected
authorities throw down the law and
set aside the power that has been
raised between the weak and the
strong in the manner done at Bisbee.
we have reason to fear the outcome,"
said Mr. Donnelly. "I care not what
the preachings or teachings or the
acts have been on the part of the men
who comprised the strikers of Co
chise county."
"It was a beckoning finger to revo
lution and thinking men and women
realize, that fact. Eefore closing this
convention I want the delegates to
take cognizance of this great wrong."
SQUADRON OF TANKS
DOES VALIANT WORK
(Continued From Page One)
numbers. Scotch trbops finished the
repulse with bayonets.
For the most part the tanks proved
that they were capable of moving ov-r
the most difficult ground but in a few
cases they were stalled at times in
holes. More than once when this hap
pened officers and crew rushed out un
der heavy fire in order to set up their
machine gun in a m'ore advantageous
position, although they would have
been comparatively safe in the tank.
Some of these Intrepid crews fought
thus until the last man was either
killed or wounded and it was due to
such acts as these that many of the
tank casualties resulted.
Co-Operation Excellent
No bombs were used against the
tanks in Tuesday's fighting for the Ger
mans discovered that they might as
well bomb the side of a battleship as
one of these heavily-armored r:s.
Nothing short of a direct tit by a
heavy shell could put a tnk out of
commission. One tank was attacked
by an airplane but the airplane after
buzzing about like an angry mosquito
fever a rhinocerous, finally sailed away
to seek easier prey.
The co-operation between the tanks
and the Infantry was well-night per
feet, the big machines keeping in con
stant contact with the soldiers. The
strain on the crews shut up in the
tanks wih their guns is tremendous
when he work is protracted as it was
Tuesday. One tank was in constant
operation for 24 hours from the time
bf attack and others were out for
many hours.
CHICAGO DRAFT BOARD
MEMBERS ARE IN BAD
CHICAGO, Aug. 6. Major B. M.
Chipperfleld of the staff of Provost
Marshal General Crowder today under
took to speed up the work cf the ex
emption boards by ordering the dismis
sal of one member, hbtly ordering an
other back from a fishing trip and lay
ing before the federal authorities a
mass of evidence of attempts to ob
struct the machinery of the draft.
"There is reason to believe that a !
few board members are holding back j
the world," Major Chipperfleld said.
"This will not be tolerated and from
now on board members or any official
connected with the draft who may de
liberately obstruct the speedy ter
mination of the work will be summar
ily dealt with."
20,000 AUSTRALIAN RAILWAY
EMPLUYES OUT ON STRIKE
SYDNEY, N. S. W., Aug. 6. A strike
of railway and street arllway employes)
which has been in effect some time,
now affects 20.000 men and is serious
ly hampering the coal mines and oth
er industries. The origin of the strike
was a dispute over the customs - of
trades unions. The government hns
promised an investigation of their
grievances three months hence.
All the negotiations have proved
abortive. The dispute represents a
struggle between the government and
the organized unions. The New South
Wales manufacturers are talking of
shutting down all industrials In or
der to assist the government.

cattlemen have urgpd the round-up and
have promised all the aid called upon

A general round-up of this size will
cost considerable, the board antfei -

cattlemen and promises to meet the
expense from the state office with the
expectation that the cattlemen will
furnish all horses, grub and wagons
necessary for the several cattle.
This work on the part of the cattle
thieves has caused the cattlemen to
become much exercised and they fear
that unless prompt action is taken the
extent of the work of the thieves will
be very large. In advance of the
general round-up the board has sent

HONOLULU VOLCANO WAKING UP
HONOLULU, Aug. 6. The volcano
cf Kilauca, is now in the midst of one
of the most spectacular phases it his
shown for many years. During the
month of May, tiie great lake of fire
rose within its encircling wall to a
height of only fifteen feet below the
rim. This was followed by a subsid
ence of some seventy feet at the ap
proach of the solstice, and a rapid rise
immediately after the conclusion of
that event. At the present time, the
lake is st ill rising, and there is every
indication that it will flow over its
rim and pour out into the vast main
crater, affording a most superb and
awe-inspiring display. Already the
neighboring hotels are filling up in
expectation of the even and scientists
are arriving to study the volcanic
phenomena accompanying the display.
STERLING, Colo., Aug. 6. A new
i forage crop said to be of more nutri
j tive value than alfalfa and more fat
Itening than clover has been discovered
I by A. R. Waldo, a homesteader near
J the North Sterling reseryojr, twelve
(miles north of Sterling. Mr. Waldo
brought a specimen here for exaniina
tion by the county agriculturist. The
plant has a many-leaved stem in the
iorm oi spikes ana is crowned by a
large flower, not unlike clover, anu
very fragrant About six acres of land
on Mr. Waldo's place is covered with
the forage and three cows which have
fed on this exclusively have produced
an abundance of butter fat.

SURE, WE'LL APOLOGIZE
The Review is in receipt of a letter
from Mrs. C. W. Cain, now at Long
Beach, taking this paper to task for
lining ber hostelry, the Golden hotel,
here in Bisbee, up on the side of the
Wobblies. She declares that her hus
band works for the Copper Queen and
that neitner her nor ber house have
aught in common with the I. W. W.

line the Golden hotel up with the Wob
blies. This paper merely printed, as
an 'advertisement the names of the
business firms not members of the
Protective league and the hotel was
among them. Since then mine hostess
has joined the league. There does not
seem to be anything to apologize for.
but since the lady desires it, far be it
from the Review to be so ungallant
as to refuse. Apologies are hereby
tendered, and along with them, con
gratulations upon thus taking a pub
lic stand for the good Of the district
and aiding with influence and with ac
tive support those who are banded to
gether to save it from those wTio
would destroy it utterly.
