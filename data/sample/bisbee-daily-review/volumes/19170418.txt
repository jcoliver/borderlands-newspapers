WASHINGTON, April 17. The,,
war finance bill providing for is
suance of $7,000,000,000 in securi
ties the largest single war bud
get in any nation's history was
passed unanimously by the sen
ate tonight. After seven hours of
discussion the administration
measure, which was passed by
the house last Saturday and
which provides for a loan to the
allies of $3,000,000,000 was ap
proved by the senate with few
changes in record time. The .
amendments may necessitate a
conference or the senate changes
.-may be accepted by the house.
Available in Few Hours
In either event the executive
branch of the government will,
within a few hours, have authori
zation for the great war chest at
its disposition.
Of the 84 senators present tonight,
every one including all those who
voted against war except Senator
Lane of Oregon, who was absent be
cause of illness, recorded themselves
in favor of providing the funds to
prosecute hostilities. Nearly all of
the twelve absentees were ill.
Give Money if Not Men
That, in the inability of the nation
to supply men at once for the fighting
lines, money should be America's im
mediate contribution to her allies,
was the dominant thought expressed
during the debate. . Few senators par
ticipated in the discussion, which was
totally devoid of partisan expression.
Every senator speaking announced
stauach intention to aid the govern
ment in prosecuting the war to speedy
conclusion. Only two. Senators Bor

to the proposed allies' loan. A few
favored raising a larger proportion by
taxation of the present generation
and less upon bonds.

EL PASO, April 17. A reliable
American who arrived at the bor
der from Mexico City, today by
way of Saltillo and Torreon, said
he had heard unverified rumors
there of a plan for a "cuartelaze"
on or before May 1, when General
Carranza would be inaugurated.
This rumored plan, he said, was
' a part of general movement to
have Obregon seize the govern
ment and was receiving German
financial and moral, backing,, he
added. He said a prominent Mex
ican had made a prediction to him
in Mexico City that Carranza nev
er would be president nor would
the new constitution be put into
effect.
He said he had learned of a plan
while in Mexico City to have Obregon
elected at the recent elections in the
nlace of Carranza by the strong Obre-
jgon party but that Carranza learned
of this while - in. Guadalajara, called
Obregon there and had charged him
with this plot, whereupon OUregon de-

was' almost unanimous for Carranza,
the American added.

bodies of defacto troops in the north,

much worry in Mexico City and it was

north to prevent Carranza from receiv

These reports and rumors were de

who said all of the rumors regarding
a break between Obregon and Carran
za had originated with Palavachini,
the Mexican editor who was arrested
recently for his newspaper attacks
upon Obregon. These articles attack
ing Obregon and questioning his loy

sul said and were responsible for the
reports about the Obregon movement.

WASHINGTON. April 17.
Warning of the probable presence
of a German submarine off the
Atlantic coast was sent broadcast
to all ships early today upon re
ceipt at the navy department of a
report from the destroyer Smith,
on patrol duty, that a torpedo had
crossed her bows during the night.
No further word came from the
Smith tonight. Navy officials, some of
whom are strongly inclined to the be
lief that the desti'jyer lookout was
mistaken, are awaiting with keep in
terest additional rt-ports received to
day at Boston. The incident serves
to illustrate the fact that a risiil patrol
has been established off the Atlantic
coast. Xo details of its operations
have been made public.

today when the I'., S. destroyer Smith

ports were received from the destroyer
tonight and were forwarded to Wash

regarding the additimal rep.irts was
made public here.

A suggestion in shipping circles tnat
the lookout on the Smith had perhaps
mistaken a larte tish for a torpedo in

ing, met with the reply that the
Smith's officers "stood by their orig

It was learned, however, that an

Homer Wood, Fair Commissioner Under
Hunt, Is Fired; Had Contracted With
Man for Pari-Mutual Betting Rights
Homer Wood, state fair commis
sioner, inspector in the contest for i'jr
aier Governor Hunt, and the latter's
bondsman in th contest rase, has
been removed by Covernor Campbell,
executive April 16.
The reason tor removing Wood is
that he let a five-year contract for the
introduction jf pari-mutuel betting
machines for races at the Arizona
State fair to C. D. Boyce, porprietor
of a cisar store at I'hoenix and tallier
for Governor Hunt in the contest.
Whether or not there has been any
connection between the proposed in
troduction of the pari-mutuel ma
chines and former Governor Hunt's
side of the gubernatorial contest, .co
incidence has not been lacking. Mr.
Boyce. the party of the second part,
is a heavy stakeholder of bets on the
result Vf the election, a -warm adher
ent of former Governor Hunt and has
been identified with the contest as
tallyman for the former governor's
side almost since the incepiion of the
contest. He is the proprietor of the
pool hall on South Center street in
Phoenix, but since the contest was
started he has left the management of
that enterprise larsrely to other hands.
It is said that he has received no
remuneration for his services in the
contest. According to Judge S. W.
McCall. the pioneer apostle of the
pari-mutuel in Arizona. Mr. Boyce
places an extravagant value on the
contract with the' commisslVmers and
offered to turn it over to him on a
fifty-fifty basis. Judge McCall felt
hurt. He had expended about $4000
of his own money finding out about
the operation of the machines else
where, in educating or trying to edu
cate the people of this state out of
their puritalical notions, and in per
mitting himself to be arrested, and de
fending a test case. Heaiing that at
last a contract was to be awarded, he
came to Phoenix accompanied by
Messrs. Talbott and Finn, of Denver,
who were expected to finance the race
meets, only to learn that the Hunt
tallyman had been chosen as lessee.
Running along with the guberna
torial contest and as has been re
marked, not necessarily connected
with it, just before the expedition
went to Snowflake to take depositions
on behalf of former Governor Hunt,
the negotiations to a head seemed de
sirable and a rpeeial messenger was
sent to Graham county to secure the
signature of Commissioner C. M. Lay
ton to the contract.
Campbell Hears of Polt
In one way or another the progress
of events was made known to Gover
nor Campbell, who had determined
that there should be no pari :iu:tui!
racing at the fair grounds or m any
property owned by the state. Thougn
not a Puritan himself, he believed lie
represented a constituency which was
overwhelmingly opposed to tne p-jri-mutuel
machines and to public gam

known hid views to Judge McCall on
this point before it was known that
the Boyce contract was being nego
tiated. If he was sure of anything,
he said, it was tnat the people did not
want that.
Whether the fair commission has
control of the state fair grounds at
any other time than during the week
of the fair is a matter of some doubt
and whether the pari-mutuel ma
chines could be used in this state is
also doubtful. Their use had been
held by the supreme t'oitit in the Mc
Call case not to be illegal, but it is
Questioned whether their status has
not been changed by the so-called
anti-gambling law passed by the last
legislature. At any rate, according to
the statement of Governor Campbell,
which follows, he believes that a more
patriotic use can be made of the
grounds and he, therefore, places them
at the disposal of the war department
in a telegram sent last night t'j Gen
eral Pershing, commanding the south
ern division.
The governor. Monday, issued this
statement:
Governor Campbell's stc .ent
"The citizens and taxpayers of Ari
zona deserve to know the rircuns
stances and incidents leading up to
the recent granting by Chairman
Layton and Commissioner Wood, of
tne Arizona State Fair Commission,
of a live-year contract to C. D. Boyce,
Phoenix, Arizona, for the operation
of the pari-mutuel machines in con
nection with horseracing on the state
fair grounds, the pioperty of the peo
ple of Arizona.
"After the conclusion of the labors
of toe third state legislature, it be
came noised about that horseracing
and the use of these machines there
with would be given a trial at Phoe
nix, probably on a track to Ik; con
structed by the company making the
venture. At the beginning of April
1, began to near run'jrs from un-1
deniably reputable sources that the
plan of the promoters of tliU project !
had changed and that it was the in- j
tention of the two reinaiaiii mem- j

Charles M. Layton. Thatcher (C. M.

"in reply I receixed the following
from Mr. Shaughnessy. under date of
April 6:
" 'Hon. Thomas E. Campbell,
" 'Goveri.'jr of Arizona,
"'State House. Phoenix, Arizona.
"'Sir: This is. to acknowledge re
ceipt of your letter of the fourth inst.
with reference to sale of concessions,
and to advise that same has been
placed before the fair commission.'
"'Respectfully your;.
" T. D. Shaughnessy, Secretary.'
Learns of Contract
"When it became apparent that
Messrs. Wood and Layton were dis
posed to ignort my warning as to en
tering into such contracts. 1 began
to use such avenues of information as
I could command, and on the after
noon of Saturday, I learned thai a
contract had been signed by the tw'J
commissioners with Boyce. Secretary
Shaughnessy, at my request, iuinisued
me with the copy ;1 the contract in
the possession of his jdice The con
tract is dated April , just three days
after my instructions were sent. This
was my first definite information that
such an arrangement had been entered
into.
"Considering it i:irom?.itib!e with
my self-respect, and beneath the con
tempt of the Viflice to which the citi
zenry of Arizona has elected me, I
shall not allude to the childish de
meanor of the officials in charge of
the fair grounds and other adminis
tration of the affairs of the state fair,
but I wish to go emphatically upon
record here and ii'jw with the state
ment that such use of state property
at a fime when the state of Arizona
and the I'nited States are in the
throes of a world conflict of unprece
dented proportions, the most serious I
consideration of the expenditures of j
every d'jllar possessed by our people j
is a sacred responsibility. ;
Believes Majority Condemns I
"Whatever the legal right of a per-J
betting machines may be. I am con
vinced that the morals of our people
is such that a majority withh condemn
severely the use of state property for
betting on horse racing
"The fair grounds are accessible "jy
rail, electric traction and excellent
highways, and because of th.dr -splendid
strategic advantages as a mobili
zation center, together with :he ac
commodations furnished by huilditi'-'s
for men and iiio-.r.its. renrt.v' g t! t ni
most vantav -i'.s. I ha '.id
offer of the use of the same to the war
department, if desired. . i
"This early announcement th;'t I
oppose the action of the commission.
I feel is due to the pe'Jple of Arizona,
and anyone outside who might other
wise become an innocent investor or
concession holder.
"I believe that no state should of
fer the use of its property for such
a purpose while entreating its citizens
to give their lives ir their country's
defense. It has too much the appear
ance of providing the favoritism of
questionable frolic for some as against
death for others.
"As. a business proposition even
admitting for the sake of argument
that gambling is a good thing fOr a
state to encourage among its people,
ten per cent of the gate receipts
would bt? an insignificant return for
the use allowed, considering wear and
tear on state properly. j
"My policy in keeping -holders of ap-
pointive offices under the past admin j
istration in power should have met
at least with the meagre respect of j
subdivision of their personal and party '
interests.
"This act ot the fair commission at
tempting to tie the state of jirizona i
for a period of an unconscionable con-1
tract, strains my patience to the break- j
ing point, and I am taking early means'
jf effecting a change in the personnel
of their offices.
"Thomas K. Campbell.
"Governor of Arizo:. i."
Statement by Mr. Boyce
Mr. Boyce, the lessee, speaking ;ast
night of the controversy, said that his ,
contract was sound and woiild be ar-'
ried out. He believed th;:t the super-;
vision provided safeguarded the in
terests of the people and the n.'irals
of tne state and that if the pari-mutuel
machines turned out to be some
thing detrimental to the inter Is of
the state, they would fall of their own
weight.
lie said that on his visit l; San
Diego, where he went to make ar
rangements for bring! i horses to
Phoenix for the meet, h- li:id b-arm d
that the races at Tijuana ha.', been 'Ji
gnat benefit to San Diegu. Horse
owners there from all parts of the
union and Canada welcomed the news
of racing in Phoenix. As a result ot
nis trip, he said, not fewer than lnO
horses would be brought here.

OFFERING AT EAGLE
"The Awakening of Helena !
Richie" Is Name of Play,;
Featuring Popular Actress, j
Appearing Today at Local
Theatre.-
The foithcoming appearance of
Kthr-1 Harrymore in "The Awakening
of Helena Richi".-' niatks a new era
in motion pictures. It is the era of a
sreat st:ir in a preat nov;-l picturized
in a pre?t way. This feature plays at
;Jie Kayle tonight.
Macaiet Oeland's powerful novel
which has been picturized is one of
the "six best sellers." It is a story
that is brimful of heart interest from
beginning to end. This heart interest
has been transferred with wonderful
force to the picture story.
In the screen adaption of the book
are shown the quaint Village of Old
Chester and the simple, strong-hearted
characters that lived there. First
of all is the venerable, sweet-natured
Dr. Ivendar. who would rather help
others than help himself. Then there
are old Benjamin Wright, crabbed,
studious; his son. the Deacon, who
has not spoken to him for years be
cause of the spanking administered
in childhood: Sam's Sam. the poet
Dr. King, the sympathetic healer, and
his kind yet critical wife.
Aniline these people, who know ev
ery detail of each other's live, comes
the beautiful Helens Richie. . Her
husbi'nd. a victim of liquor, has killed
their infant in Paris. She has trusted
In her old suitor. Loyd Pryor and. at
his urging, has chosen Old Chester
as her home in an effort to find peace
and rest. Th" villagers know nothing
of her past life. They are led to be
lieve thai I.loyd. who visits Old Ches
ter occasionally, is her brother. Ue
plizing that she is lonely, they try to
bring sunshine into her soul.
Dr. Lavendar introduces the home
less little David to her. Straightway
the sturdy child wins a plce in her
heart and slip adopts him. A strange
spiritual jealousy springs up between
Pryor, the man. who is compelling
Helena to lead a "double lite," and
the innocent boy.
At last when her husband dies in
Europe. Pryor tells Helena she must
choose between him and little David.
She believes she loves Pryor. She
knows she loves the boy. A great
soul-storm takes place, within her
the fire of passion and the earthquake
of selfishness. And then, after the
fire conies the still small voice.
The soul of Helena Richie is awak
ened. RECEIVER ASKED FOB

Shippings offered obstinate resist

CHICAGO GRAINS
CHICAGO, April 17. Wheat prices
crashed down headlong today as much
as 14Vi because of wild selling, chief
ly the-result of government action
which made millions Of bushels of
Canadian wheat-in the United States
free of duty. The market closed un
settled 7Vi to 12 cents net lower,
with May. at 224 to 224 U and July at
190 to 191 . Corn lost 4'i to
net. outs 2 to i and provisions 42
to $1.0.2.
Violently contracting conditions
faced the wheat trade'at the opening
as compared with the bullish outlook
of the day before when the market
had jumped uj 13 ',i cents and seemed
on the verge of a frenzied further rise
fcecalise of threatened scarcity of sup
plies. , Collapses in wheat values became
greater in the last hour owing to sub
. marine rumors, peace talk, the ad
ministration embargo bill and heavy
rains. Corn was influenced almost wholly
by the action of wheat. Oats weaken
ed with other cereals. Active liquida
tion sah's for holders formed the rule
in provisions. Chances of federal con
trol of packing houses gave impetus
to unloading and so too did the sharp
descent of the com market.

HIGH FINANCE AND A CONTEST.
"Necessity is the mother of invention," is an old aphor
ism, which his its recurrent uses at very stated inter
vals. The man, who propounded the original, however,
should have gone one step further. The quoted maxim
does not infer that necessity sometimes breeds invention
that is a second cousin to artful knavery and just 'within
the law.' Homer Woods, one of George Hunt's support
ers, has come forward wfth a new system in financing
governorship contests, even if it is rather shady.
Now. be is known. Homer Woods has always been a
progressive. During the .first state legislature, in com
pany with Mike Cuniff, .he saved the state of Arizona
from dire peril, time after time. He is a big, dark, fine
looking man and usually peered through the glasses of
the then Governor. Yavapai county was Woods' home
It may be now, when he isn't at the public trough.
Woods failed to be sent to the second state legislature
He had something to do in Yavapai county and the
Governor then G. W. P. Hunt didn't have pnything tc
Woods' liking in the state house. It was beneath Homer's
dignity to accept a mere clerkship, regardless of his dis
position against civilian work. All that George W. P.
cculd find for Homer was a place on the state fair com
mission. That job carried a per diem with it and afford
ed Hcnier with an opportunity to visit Phoenix quite
often and confer with the other leaders of the "Demo
cratic" party.
Presently a state election was held. It was very close
Tom Campbell, on the official returns, was elected gov
ernor, and after considerable 'milling' was seated. Then
George W. P. Hunt refused to be beaten. He instituted
a contest. His principal backer, in that contest, is and
has been Homer Woods. Woods has been on the job
4
sine it was instituted and is one of Hunt's bondsmen.
That gubernatorial contest has cost money; resjl hon-est-to-goodness
money, and that philanthropic statesman
from Globe, who occupied the big, white, state automo
bile, for two terms, never did like the idea of putting up
good money for a contest (or anything else). No sir,
bis henchmen should bear the brunt of such a proceed
ing. As has been remarked, su'i a proceeding costs
money. The henchmen, who have been allowed to re
main in office by Tom Campbell, gathering sinews of
war at the expense of the state and at the political ex
pense of the Republican governor, have gotten tired of
tbir job. Money must be had and some other source
must be found. .
"We see light," must have been Homer's Homeric re
mark. "The supreme court did not declarei the pari
mutual machines to be against the law. We will capital
ize the pari-mutual and raise some wherewithal, with
which to put our guiding light back into his comfortable
place in the big, white automobile." .
There is a resident of Phoenix by the name of C. r
Boyce. Boyce operates a pool room and cigar stand. He
bet his good money on Hunt and was the stakeholder
of much other money! bet in the" same manner. When
the oontest started Iloycc aided in the tallying of the
count and has been a regular attendant at the court
house. His business, presumably, has been of secondary
importance.
Why shouldn't Boyce be considered as the logical per
son to haudle the gambling privileges in connection with
the state fair? Why shouldn't a friend and supporter of
former governor Hunt and Homer Wood, that apostle of
fair play, goodness and righteousness from Yavapai coun
ty, have the right to take off a percentage of the bets
wagered on horse races in Arizona? Homer Wood and
his companion on the fair commission saw no reason
against the proposition and signed a contract granting
Bayce the exclusive privilege of operating betting nia
cihnes. The money consideration was not mentioned.
Judging from the lack of information, on the subject,
Iioycc must have been given the concession by the two
fair commissioners in return for his 'work' and 'interest'
displayed in behalf of the cx-governor of the state.
It may be a peculiar conclusion to reach but it is
natural to wonder just exactly what sum Boyce offered
the Hunt contest committee for the exclusive right to
operate pari-mutual betting machines on the state fair
grounds. Boyce, of course, is another philanthropist.
He is in business fur his health. He liet on George limit,
for .'lis ( Boyce 's) health, lu.st fait. IU is working fur
Hunt, at the present time, for his health, and he took
over the exclusive privilege to operate betting machines
.f a" Fe ve vanled the rr!e of the state of Aii-
-. or those v. h3 attend the state fair, to hav srm-'
t'ey can plae their bets cn Worses
and other races advantageously.
While we believe that Boyce entered Into the contract j
with Homer Wood and the state fair commission in order
to relieve that body of a "white elephant," we cannot
see where the state of Arizona is getting off in the deal.
Maybe the Hunt contest fund is profiting, thereby, in
-h1-h Case Governor Campbell is to be commended for
" 'a action in summarilly dismissing Homer Wood from
' e fair commission. Certainly the good people of Ari
ona will support the Governor in his effort to protect
e state from the wiles of Homer Woods and his politi
cal friends in turning over, for a profit, the gambling
privileges of the commbnwealth.

THE VOLUNTEER SYSTEM FAILURE!
The volunteer system is a straw after which a large
number of people are grabbing in the United States.
AH the men who are desirous of eliminating the possi
bility of serving for their country are ardent supporters
of the volunteer system. Members of congress, for some
reason or other, have failed to see the system's failure
in the past and are. now failing to take into considera
tion England's experience with the system at the be
Tinning of the present great war.
Chicago Tribune, under the heading of "Shall We Wait
Till the War is Lost?" offers an excellent argument
against the system which it would pay every man and
woman to read and then to petition congress on the sub
let. Surely President Wilson and Secretary Baker are
right in their demand for a law, allowing a selective draft
in order to raise an army.
The Tribune's editorial follows:
"While the volunteer 'system is breaking down before
their eyes members of congress are demanding that we
wait until it has been given "a thorough trial" before
obligatory service is demanded.
"The volunteer system has always failed. It has failed
-ow. Yet these men, who have learned nothing from
jur past and will learn nothing from the present, de
mand that the defense of the nation shall wait while
he certain is once more demonstrated.
"We say this is criminal folly, the result of culpable
'norance and of inexcusable prejudice. It stamps these
obstructionists as unfit to be in charge of the nation's
'o- and safety at such a time.
"Obstruction to the swiftest possible development of
- military resources is little short of treason at this
nomenL At best our military preparation must take
months of the utmost effort. Yet the war hangs today in
" balance. The British 'and French successes on the
"est front, while encouraging as indication of the efti
ncy of the Anglo-French war machine, must not be
jermitted to distract our attention from the extremely
mi nous reports from Russia. The overthrow of the
psent government whose tenure is most precarious at
est, would almost certainly mean a formal' separate
eace by the succeeding government, whether radical or
eactionary. And if Russia should quit, or even if her
military activities were neutrlaized by internal disorders,
the Anglo-French army would be confronted by virtually
he whole Gernino, Austro-Hungarian, Bulgarian and
Turkish power.
"What would be the result? Could our allies hold out
until our army is reated and trained? It is not likely,
and if they could not, peace would stand on Germany's
erms and America would stand alone against the great
est military power in the world. Could we afford then t
rely upon the volunteer system to keep our army full and
"Iways ready? The Gallingers and the Dents and the
Iryans may think so, but if we followed their leadership
disaster would be certain.
"If Russia makes peace and the central powers t'.ien
force peace upon England and France, Germany, with
the greatest armies and the second greatest of navie,s.
would be free to compensate herself for her losses at
our expense and the South American republics which are
now entering the war against her. Germany's place in
the sun would be South America, and what could we do
to prevent her if the Bryans, the Dents, and the Galling
rs prevail in congress?
"At the close of the cival war the United States was
ready to fight France or all Europe to keep imperial
hands off Mexico. Germany, with similar military and
naval power, will be tempted to recoup and to expand
at the expense of the American nations which have turn
ed against her.
"We have virtually invited Iatin America to join us
against Germany. Can we protect it against the conse
quences of this action?
"We cannot now, and we shall never he able to, if
the folly of these obstructionists represent the wisdom
of congress.
"The issue of universal liability to service is funda
mental to the safety of this republic. The man who is
ifraid to back this principle in the face of war is afraid
to uphold the flag and the constitution.
"If the nation dare not demand this service, if it must
beg and wheddle and cheat to obtain it which is the
only way the volunteer system will work even as litth;
s it will work then democracy has failed in this coun
try,' for in the hour of need it is afraid to demand its
rights from its own citizens." .

REGULATING SALE OF '
FIREARMSJS PASSED
Measure Adopted Last Night
Provides That Every Dealer
Shall Immediately Register
With City Marshal
The city council last night gently
but firmly refused to Increase the pay
of Chief Barney Norton and members
of the fire department after a heated
discussion in which Chief Norton and
Councilman Holl were the principal
participants. Hardly had Norton tak
en the floor and asked the mayor and
council to Increase salaries in his de
partment on the ground of the Ions
hours put in by the firemen, the high
er cost of living and the fact that oth
er, cities were paying their firemen
more, than Councilman Holz came out j
flat-footed and opposed it with the ar- j
gument that the city had no money
for any more salary increases and
that the firemen were getting paid
enough at present, considering the
amount of work they did. jOther mem
bers of the council expressed the
opinion that the firemen should be
paid more, but said the city was help
less to do anything at present.
Chief Norton, in several verbal
skirmishes with Councilman Holz. de
clared that the local department h?d
j cles shall be registered in a book kept (
by the city marshal, shall wi'hin eight i
days furnish the marshal with a com-'l
! plete inventory of any firearms, am-
munitio a or exjiiosaes he bliail have
! on hand and shall keep a record of
: the name, address and nationality of
j any person to whom any of there ar-
I tides is sold and shall also report the !
quantity of t'.ic purchase. A penaity
of a fine not to exceed $200 ami im
prisonment fcr not more than 60 days
in the city Jajl is attached for viola
tion of the ordinance.

(By Review Leased Wire.)
WASHINGTON, April 17 Secre
tary Baker told the hou.-e military
committee tlatly tonight that the war
department's plan for the organization
of an army by selective Conscription
was the only feasible way of meeting
the emergency with Germany.
A plan pat forward in the commit
tee by Kepresentatie Lunn, Democrat
of New York, which Secretary Baker
agreed would be acceptable to the war
department, contemplated that in
stead of the conscription of men be
tween the ages of 19 and 25, there
should he four classes, to be succes
sively reached in the draft, beginning
with 500,000 men in the first class, be
tween the ages Vf 21 and 27. w ith au
thority for the President to call as
many more of this class as he deems
in his discretion before going to the
next class. The otner three groups,
in sequence, would be between the
ages of -S and Zi, 35 and 41, and 42
and 48.
Another plan talked over in commit
tee proposed that all of Cue additional
men needed to fill up the regular army
aud the national guaid should be pro
duced by the volunteer pu with tile
draft scheme operating at the same
time to raise the new war army.

To Mining
Investors
The Verde S'luaw Copper Mining Company of Jerome. Arizona, ha
a niountain of mineral wealth consisting of 275 acres in the rirhest
copper producing district on earth, with an' expanse of sufrace mineral
ization that is astounding, and wont.erful ledges of ore uncovered that
assay from : to 4lt per cent copper, gold and silver.
The company is offering for public subscription a limited -amtnmt
of its treasury stock fully paid and nonassessable at the excep
tionally low price of 25 cents a sliare. to finance the installation of
modern machinery, so they may start- immediate development on a
large scale, and put the property on a substantial, dividend paying
basis in the unickest possible time.
War has created a demand fcr copper that is overtaking the refin
eries of the world. The demand for copper increases every month.
The price mounts until today 40 cent copper is not only a probability,
but a living possibility. F:ven at half that price, copper mining is im
mensely profitable, making: it t.'ie greatest investment of modern times,
for there is no line of human endeavor that actually returns to the in
vestor in honest, clean money, the gigantic returns that copper does.
There wore 12 millionaires made in Arizona copper in 1916. and
hundreds of others made independently wealthy. What is true of 191
is trucn a greater degree for the next 5 or 10 years. So if yon want
a ground floor interest in cue of Arizona's greatest properties, w
earnestly advise that you send in your order at one, as over half our
'present allotment of 25 cent stock has already l'en taken here a'
home.

GREATEST BATTLE OF
WAR RAGES ON AISNE
SO GERMANS REPORT
(By Review Leased Wire)
; BERLIN, via London, April IT, (5:55
p. ni.) The German official statement
issued today says:
"One of the greatest battles of the
mighty war and therefore a;so in the
history of the world is in progress on
the Aisne.
"Since April 6. preparatory tire by
the artillery and mine throwers has
continued uninterruptedly. Dy this
fire which was unprecedented in dura
tion, volume -''and in intensity, the
French endeavored to render our posi
tions ripe fotr assault, put WW fiat
leries out of action and exhaust -bur
troops.
"Early yesterday morning French ar
tillery' on a front 40 kilometers
launched with the idea of breaking
through an attack fi'jm Soupier on the
Aisne to Bethany, north of Rheims.
"During the afternoon the French
threw several divisions into the fray
and carried lateral attacks against our
front between the Oise and Conde-sur-Aisne.
The artillery fiaht which was
continued today levelled the positions
and produced wide, deep craters ren
dering an obstinate defense no longer
possible.
"The fighting is rfj longer against a
line but over quite( a deep and irregu
lar zone. The battle swayed back
Wards and forward around the fore
most position:-, our object being even
if war material were lost to spare the
lives of our forces and inflict heavy
losses upon the enemy. This was
achieved,; thanks to splendid leader
ship and the heroic bravery of 'our
troops.
"The great French attempt to break
through yesterday, the object of which
was far reaching failed. The sanguin
ary losses of the enemy were heavy
and more than 2100 prisoners remain
ed in our hands."

ment of the army to prepare and con
duct training camps for reserve offi
cers, the firt 10.000 to Become officers
of the first half million tro'ops .raised
for the increasedarmy. The sites se
lected for 'the camps include Fort
Riley, Kansas, forts in Missouri, Kan
sas and Colorado.
Each camp will train officers for a
full division and one additional cav
alry regiment. The maximum attend
ance at each camp will be 2500. The
attendants will be divided Into 15 com
panies for the first month, and all
trained alike TJr that period. At the

standard with respect to character and
sobriety, personality, address, force,
reputation and standing in his commu
nity, likelihood of his being able to

enlisted men and adequacy of his edu
cation. Preference will be given to
men of valuable military . experience.
College students are advised to at
tend the camp provided for the state

ALLIED SLACKERS IN

WASHINGTON. April 17.
The House judiciary commit
tee yesterday approved Chair
man Webb's bill which would
permit allies to recruit their
citizens in the United States.
"It Is quite evident." said the
report accompanying the bill,
"that the allies who are fight
ing a country against whom we
also have declared war should
be permitted to recruit from
their citizens and subjects in
the United States for the pur
pose of fighting that country's
battles. In view of the fact
that our country is contem
plating the conscription of our
boys to wage war against Ger
many, certainly the allies
should be permitted at least to
persuade their citizens in the
United States to po and di
likewise."

Prof. Hertzog Praises
This Perfect Laxative
DR,
CAtDWEtt'S SYRUP PEPSIN
AN IDEAL REMEDY FOR
CONSTIPATION.
j In every family there is more or less
occasion ltr a laxative remery. It is
I to meet this need that Dr. Caldwell's
; Syrup Pepsin is prepared, and that
' .' this combination of simple laxative
j herbs with pepsin fulfills its purpose
is proven by its place in thousands of
! American homes.
Prof. F. J. C. Hertzog. the well known
linguist, 2341 North Orianna St, Phila
delphia, Ta., wrote to Dr. Caldwell that
he has used Dr. Caldwell's Syrup Pep
sin in his household with excellent re
sults and that he and his family con
sider it iudeed a friend iu need, and al
ways keep a bottle of it on hand. .
Constipation is the direct cause of
much serious illness and Is a condition
that should never be neglected. Harsh
cathartics and
should never be
viole-f. nureatives
employed to relieve
constipation, because the very violence
of their action shocks the entire sys
tem. A mild laxative, such as Dr.
Caldwell's Syrup Pepsin Is far prefer
able, being mild and gentle in Its ac-
tion, without griping or other pain or
discomfort; its freedom from all
opiate or narcotic drugs makes it an
Ideal remedy for children.

t Says corn rings, plasters, razor
and Elating Salves are
tabu now.
Good things should be passed along
It is now said that a few drops of a
drug called freezone applied directly
upon a tender, aching corn relieves
the soreness and soon the entire corn,
root arid all. can be lifted out without
pain.
For little cost a quarter of an ounce
of freezone can be obtained from any
drug store which is claimed to be
sufficient tn remove every hard or
soft corn or callus from one's feet
This is a drug recently announced
from Cincinnati. It is gummy but
dries the moment it Is applied and
simply shrivels up the corn without
inilaming or even irritating the heal
thy tissue or skin.

CONSTIPATION AND INDIGESTION
These are twin evils. Persons suf
fering from indigestion are often trou
bled with constipation. Mrs. Robert
Allison, Mattoon, 111., writes that when
she first moved to Mattoon she was
a great sufferer from indigestion and
constipation. Fod distressed her end
there was a feeling like a heavy
weight pressing on her stomach and
chest She did not rest well at night,
and felt worn out a good part of the
time. One bottle of Chamberlain's
Tablets corrected this trouble so that :
she has since felt like a different per-;
son. Adv. ;
