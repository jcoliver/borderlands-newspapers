BAD WEATHER IS

In the Meantime Germany
Continues to Extend Feel

Retain Grasp on Far East
(Undated War Lead by The Associated
Press)
Rainy weather in northern France
has caused the thorough soaking of
the ground particularly in the lowly
ine nnrtions of the battle front and oer-
haps has had something to do with
the delay of the Cerman offensive.
It fa a mnnth now nine the last of
fensive died down, swamped by the
tide of a French success north or com
piegne. and there is no sign of the
enemVg being ready to strike again.
The allies have" been repeatedly
pushing back the German lines little
by little at various important points.
These have gained va't-able defensive
ground and brought in thousands of
prisoners. .
German diplomatists are again air
ing war aims program and engage in
reace discussions among themselves.
The chancellor has touched the vital

the stiit us of that nation to peace, and
has declared Germany does not Intend j
to reiain that country "in any form j
whatever." i
She is holdiag It as a powa in the
negotiations, he says, and the German
government finds it expedient to ex
plain this utterance in an official state
ment which It declared that the holder
of a pawn does not intend to keep it,
"if the negotiations bring a satisfac
tory result."
Germany also is exercised at the
situation in Russia if the utterances
of her newspapers go for anything.
The idea that the Bolshevik! are re

organs. The fear the German edince

WASHINGTON, July 13 News of
the despatch of British reinforcements

TERMS OF PEACE
Lloyd George Says That as
Canada, Australia and New
Zealand Have Aided in
War, They Should Speak
rrtv Review T ensed Wire)
LONDON. July 13. The govern
ments of British dominions will have
a voice in determining the terms cf
peace, according to Mr. Lloyd George.
The prime minister made this state
ment in a speech at a dinner given in
honor of the Canadian editors who are
visiting England, at which Lord Beav
erbrook was the hest.
"This Is a war in which we engaged
the empire," said the premier, "when
we had no time to consult the domin
ions as to policy and it is perfectly
true that the policy which we adopt
ed to protecf small nations in Europe
was a policy embarked upon without
any conservation of the dominion. But
you approved it. Henceforth you have
the right to be conserved as to the
fpolicy beforehand, and this is the
change which has been effected as the
result of the war.
"Canada and Australia and New Zea
land yes. and Newfoundland, they
have all contributed their share of sac
rifice and they are entitled to an epual
voice with the representatives of these
islands will determine the conditions
under which we are prepared to make
peace. Unless I am mistaken, we are
pretty well in agreement upon them.
"There must be no hugger-mugger
peace. It must be a real peace. We
are not waging war for the sake of
killing or of being killed, but for th
sake of establishing a just and durable
peace for the world. You cannot
n.ake peace unless it is both just and
likely to endure.
"We in this country who have lost
hundreds of thousands and have had
millions maimed, and you In Canada,
whose casualties have amounted to
scores of thousands, and Australia,
who has also played her share in these
things we are not making these sacri
fices in order to establish a fraud on
this earth, and anything less than r.
real peace will be defrauding not this
generation but the next generation it
will be defrauding humanity.
"Germany has waged these wars,
and each time she has added through
these wars to her strength, to her pow
er, to her guidance, to her influ"iicn
and each successive war she has
waged has inevitably encouraged her
on to the next. If she had had one

brates our Fourth of July so do we
celebrate her Fourteenth, keenly con
scious of a comradeship of arms and
of purpose of which we are proud.
"The sea seeni.s vory narrow today.
France is so close a neighbor to our

pave ourse'ves from intolerable things
but is also being fousht to save man

fore the United States entered the war

scattered throughout northern Mexico
gave evidence of the German Intention
to exploit the Mexican markets.
One German wholesale hardware
firm started to establish branches
throughout the state more than 40
years ago, and at the outbreak of the
revolutions, had branches in operation
in Juarez, Casas Grandes. Santa Ros
alia, Ojinaga and other places with a
parent store here.
While these houses rere conducted
on business lines, it is considered
here as a significant fact that all the
German consuls and vice consuls for
this part of Mexico were appointed
from among the managers and assist

the branch managers were also Ger

Patriotism
A government official recently declared
that the show window displajrs of the stores
of the country had been of great help in all
war wcrks of the government. He cited
the cases of the Liberty bond and Red Cross .
drives where every store in every town
made a window display of flags, mottoes,
pictures, emblems, historical settings, etc.,
that played a stirring part in the success of
these governmental efforts. Bisbee stores,
it will be remembered, did their part in this
line. Patriotism is not to be gauged by any
single giant outburst or display in proces
sion or on platform, but rather, its great
strength lies in the steady glow of the flame
and flow of the flood. Patriotism is born
at the fireside and nutured.at the shop and
office and street corner end picture show
and store, and, deeper still, in cur thoughts
and ideals and by our smaller acts and sac
rifices. The purpose of patriotism is man
ifested involuntarily in every act of our
work 'and play. Its spirit shines forth in
voluntarily in the smallest, simplest things.
For instance, here is an example : Two Bis
bee men, both owners of autos, were talk
ing the other evening, and one spoke of the
new war tax soon to be placed upon gas
oline. The other said: "Well, it will be
easy for those of us who have had cars( for
a long time; the novelty of driving haj
worn off with us", we can quit thinking-,
about pleasure trips without any strain. But
it will be hard on those fellows who have
just bought cars and who are wild to drive
them from Dan to Beersheba." And the
man laughed heartily. A small matter,
this, but nevertheless it shows the splendid
spirit of support that our citizens are giving,
our government in all things and at cost cf
money and pleasure.
Von Hindenburg reported dead again
The fat German field marshal' with the
fierce moustache must have as many lives
as a cat. But as to whether he is dead and
in the tomb or still strutting in steel and
gilt and leather, matters but little to the
allies, for he has been only a figurehead in
German military affairs for many months
past. Von Ludendoerf i3 the sparkplug of
the Prussian general staff now, and Von
Hindenburg is merely the wooden idol of a
lot of simple-minded German people. At.
his best he was only the "best strategist of
ihc Maurian marshes," as Von Falkynburg
sarcastically remarked when he was called
from the Russian line to Berlin. Beating
the Russians was one thing, and beat the
allies was another. And, so, in his turn,
whether man or shade, Von Hindenburg's
military reputation and place has gone to
join the many, many has-beens of this great
war.
Still the German military writers con
tinue to belittle the Americans and'the pnrt
they shall play in the war. They are be
ginning to admit that maybe we have more
than 20,000 men in France, after feeding
this number to the German people for a
year, but they claim that we cannot fight.
That we cannot begin to take the place of
the "we!1 trained Russians" in the war.
Name of a name! That is the crowning
insult of all ! Not as good as the Russians,
vho fought a li tic find ran avay. Well,
we stung them at Cantigny, and agin at
Chateau Thierry, and once more at Belleau
Wood. Beat the best the kaiser had, man
for man. Maybe we cannot fight. The
Prussians said that Kitchener's mob of
Englishmen could not fight, either. But
after four years of bitter battling from Cam
brai to the sea, the Germans are talking
peace and giving up Belgium instead of
marching riifut ahead on the channel parts.
No, the Americans cannot fight. Oh, you
Prussian.,! " You will be telling a different
tale about it at this time next year!
LOYAL DEMOCRATS
SHOULD REGISTER
Signals of Distress
In srite of all the confident assurances
from allied military leaders that Germany,
is prepared to deliver the greatest blow of
all upon the western front and will soon
strike, this column, after reading Von Hert
ling's speech, made before the reichstag
Friday, is inclined to doubt that Germany
will make the effort and the sacrifice. If
ever a baffled nation called upon its spokes
men to sound a retreat from the battle line,
that nation was Germany and that spokes
man was Von Hertling. The chancellor
practically declared that Germany had shot
her bolt in the west. His nation wants to
hear peace talk and not shell bursts. With
Russia and the Balkans under his paw the
Prussian would give anything the allies
ask in the wesf. And then, ten years hence,
with the unlimited resources and cannon
fodder of this vast country organized and
developed under German domination,
France and England could be swept away
in one short, fierce campaign, and Amer
ica conquered at leisure. The truce now
sought by the Prussian is the real time of
peril for the allies, and not the crisis of any
battle in France, Constant, unending, un
ceasing pressure, upon that German bat
tle line wtih every ounce of power attain
able, is the only answer the allies can safely
make to any German move, whether mili
tary or political. Von Hertling's sprech
was the distress signal cf-a distressed ad
versarv. If we never let up for a minute,
we will soon begin to see tangible military
results from the pressure.
Von Hertling declared that Germany,
would "loyally stand by the Biest-Litovsk
peace treaty." Sure she will. Why not f
By ir she gained a new empire as large and
much richer in resources than all of the
German empire previous to the declaration
of W3'.
If the allies can only push that Albanian
victory to its full fruits of success the oft
prophecied fell of Austria will surely ccme
true. A bold stroke right now on the
Macedonian front might well put Bulgaria
out of the war, separate Turkey from Ber
lin and hasten the collapse of the nation
ruled by Charles the Simple. But up to
this period of the war there has been no
allied chieftian who has had the genius and
the soul of flame to make that bold, desper
ate stroke that stakes all to win all. If
every man and gun available in all the
Macedonian area of the war were thrown
headlong into this Albanian breach by the
Napoleonic hand that ence launched the
thunderbolts of France, ah, the fate of the
war might be changed in a day and a sud-,
den tide set in towards Berlin that would
never be stopped until it washed the foun
dations of the Brandenburg gate.
The situation of the 50,000 Czecho
slovak troops in Russia,' who are at the
present time holding Vladivostok, Irkutsk
and Samara, will shortly become critical, it
was learned on the highest authority, unless
relief is instantly given to them. Inasmuch
as Japan alone is in a position to act with
force to save the Czechb-Slovak troops who
already control one-half of Siberia, and also
as Japan alone is able immediately to throw
into Siberia a sufficient' number of troops
to create a front behind which the pro-ally
and loyal Russians might organize and
equip an army, it is believed that President
Wilson has decided the present moment is
propitious for carrying into execution both
projects, the relief of the Czecho-Slovaks
and the creation of a new Rusisan front.
Congress starts its summer vacation
Monday, after a long, hard session which
undoubtedly has been a strain, physical
and mental upon many of the members. A
vast deal of important legislation has been
transacted, even though much piccaunish
by-play has been indulged in and there has
been not a little political log rolling on the
part of some members who had their eyes
on their "fences" at heme.
And still the Germans hesitate to ad
vancR ;ind take. P.u is and the ports along
the channel. He who hesitates is lost.

PRISON LABOR MAY BE
USED TO HELP IN
Early icgistration of all loal demo
cratic voters for participation in the
primary election, September 10, is
urged by the Warren Distict Smut
club in a statement issued yesterday
trom the organisations headquarter?
in the Maize building. In the same
statement tne club announced the ad
dition of moie than 600 members to its
rolls in the past week and an in
crease in membership to more than
2100. Ainercianisin and loyalty, the
paramount issues in the primary elec
tion, especially as pertaining to the
race foi nomination for governor, are
cited as reasons for urging early icgis
tratoii of all democrats. ltegstratiou to
uatc has been active but not heavy.
In retorting to the activities of the
Sutter club the statement declares
that the er.ro'lwnt of one week ngo
which totaled almost; 1500, has uow
been increased by more than inn resi
pledged membership up to ulcus ilian
dents of this district, bunging the
pledged membership up to mote than

for the launching of Sutter dabs in
many of the small precincts and in the
towns and cities ot the countj" are be

end of the next week will see the ad

members ta the records of tiie centras

Fall of the Bastile, July 14, 1789,
A Tempest of the People's Fury
(From Carlyle's French Revolution)
Ever wider swells the tide of men,
their infinite hum waxing ever louder
into imprecations, perhaps into crackle
of -stray musketry. The outer draw
bridge has been lowered for Thuriot;
a new deputation of citizens (it is the
third and noisiest of all) penetrates
the outer court; t.oft speelies produc
ing no clearance of these, De Launay
gives fire, pulls up his drawbridge. A
slight sputter which has kindled the
too combustible chaos made it a roar
ing fire chaos! Bursts forth insur
rection at sight of its own blood (for
there were deaths by that sputter of
fire) into endless, rolling explosion of
musketry, distraction, execration, and
overhead, from the fortress, let one
great gun, with its grapeshot, go
booming to show what ire could do.
The Bastille is besieged!
On then, all Frenchmen that have
hearts in your bodies. Smite thou,
Louis Tournay, cartwright of the
Marais, old soldier of the regiment
Dauphine- smite at the outer draw
bridge chain, though the fiery hall
whistles around thee! Down with it,
man; down with it to Orcus!' Let the
whole accursed edifice sink thither and
tyranny be swallowed up for ever!
The chain yields, breaks; the huge
drawbridge slams down, thundering.
Glorious! And yet, alas, it is still but
the outworks. The eight grim towers,
with their invalide musketry, their pav
ing stones and cannon mouUis, stiil
soar aloft, intact; ditch yawning im
passable, stone-faced; the Inner draw
bridge with its back toward its; the
Bastille is still to take!
Ordnance of all calibres, throats of
all capacities, men of all plans. every
man his ovn engineer; seldom since
the war of pygmies and cranes was,
there seen so anomalous a thing. Paris
wholly, has got to the acme of its
frenzy, whirled all ways by panic mad
ness. At every sueei uaim-auc iuwi.
whirls, simmering, a minor whirlpool, j
the barricade. sinc8 God
knows what is coming; and all minor
whirlpools play distractedly into that
grand fire-mahlstrom which is lashing
round the Bastille.
And so it lashes and it roars. Cholat,
the wine merchant, has become an im
promptu cannoneer. See Georget cf
the marine service, fresh from Brest,
ply the King of Siam's cannon.
I'pward from the esplanade, horizon
tally from all the neighboring windows
and roefs, flashes one irregular deluge
r.t mnsketrv. withcut effect. The in-
valides lie flat, firing comparatively
at their ease from behind stone; hard
ly through port holes show the tip of
a nose, vye fall, shot, and make no I
impression!
Let conflagration rage cf whatever:
is combustible! Guard rooms are,
burnt, invalides' me.ss rooms. A joung
beaiit'lul lady, seized, trying to escape
in the outer courts, and thought, false-j
Iv, to be De Launay's daushter, shall
be burnt in De Launay s sight; sne
lies swooned, on a pailliase; but again ;
a patriot it is brave Aunin Bonnem-1
iere, the old soldier dashes in and i
rescues her. Straw is burnt; three i
cart loads of it, hauled hither, go up in
white smoke almost to the choking of j
patriotism itself. Smoke as of Tophet j
confusion as cf Babel, noise af of the j
crack of doom! j
I.'lood flows, the aliment of new
madness. The wounded are carried
into the houses of the Rue Cerisale;
the dying leave their mandate not to
yield until the accused stronghold fall.
And vet, alas! how fall? The walls are
so thick! Individuals of classical
knowledge propose catapults. San
tere, the sonorous brewer of the sub
urb Saint-Antoine. advises rather that
the place be fired with a mixture of
phosphorous and oil of turpentine
snouted un throuch forcing pumps.
O Spinola-Santlerre, hast thou the mix
ture ready? Every man his own engi- j
neer! And still the fire deluge abates j
not- even women are uring, mm
Turks at least cne woman (with her
sweetheart), and one Turk.
How the great Bastille clock ti'-'ts
(inaudible) in its inner court, there.
m m.w. lionr after hour: as it notn-
special for it and the -world were
passing! It tolled 1 when me iirmsi
began, and is now pointing toward 5 1
at
ins
and still the firing slacks not. Far
down in their vaults the seven prison
ers hear muffled din as of earthquakes
their turnkeys answer vaguely.
Woe to thee, De Launay, with they
poor hundred inalides! Brogile is
distant, and bis ears are heavy; Bes
enval hears, but can send no help. One
poor troop of hussars has crept, recon
noitering, cautiously along the quais
as far as the Pont Neuf. "We are
come to join you," says the captain,
for the crowd seems shoreless. A large
headed dwarfish individual, of smoke
bleared aspect, shambled forward, op
ening his blue lips, for there is sense
in him, and croaks, "Alight, then, and
give up your arms!" The hussar cap
tain is too happy to be escorted to the
barriers and dismissed on parole. Who
the squat individual was? Men an
swer it is M. Marat, author of the ex
cellent pacific Avis au Peuple. Great,
truly, O thou remarkable dog-leech, is
this thy day of emergence and new
birth; and yet this same day come
four years but let the curtains of the
future hang.
What shall De Launay do? One
thing only De Launay could have done
what he said he would do. Fancy
him sitting from the first with the
lighted taper, within arm's length ol
the powder magazine; motionless, like
old Roman senator, or bronze lamp
holder; coldly apprising Thuriot, and
all men, by a slight motion of his eye,
what his resolution was. Harmless re
sat there, while unharmed;1 but the
king's fortress, meanwhile, could,
might, would or should in nowise be
surrendered save to the king's messen
ger; one old man's life is worthless, so
it be lost with honor; but think, ye
brawling canaille, how will it be when
a whole Bastille nprings skyward? In
such statuesque, taper holding attitude
cne fancies De Launay might have left
Thuriot, the red clerks of the basoche,
cure cf Saint-Stephen, and all the rag
tag and bcbtail of the world, to work
their will.
And j et, withal, he could not do it
Hast thou considered how each man's
heart is so tremulously responsive to
the hearts of all men? Hast thou not
ed how omnipotent is the very soul of
many .men? How their shriek of in
dignation palsies the strong soui?
Their howl of contumely withers with
unfelt pangs? The Ritter Gluck con
fessed that the ground tone of the nob
lest passage in one cf his noblest op
eras was the voice of the populace he
had heaTd in Vienna, crying to their
kaiser. Bread! Bread! Great is the
combined voice of men, the utterance
of their instincts, which are truer than
their thoughts; it is the greatest a
man encounters among the sounds and
shadows which make up this world of
time. He who can resist that has his
looting somewhere beyond time. De
Iauiy could not do it. Distracted, he
hovers between two hopes in t'.ie mid,
die of despair; surrenders not his fort
ress, declares that he will blow it up.
and does not blow it. Unhappy old De
Launay, it is the death agony of thy
Bastille and thee!
For four hours now has the world
bedlam roared; call it the world chi
mera, blowing fire! The poor invalid
es have sunk under their battlement3.
or rise only with reversed muskets;
they have made a white flag of nap
kins, go beating the chamade, or seem
ing to beat, for one can hear nothing.
The very Swiss at the portcullis look
weary of f;ring, disheartened in the
fire deluge- a porthole at the draw
bridge is cpened, as by one that would
speak. See Hulsoler Maillard. the
shifty man! On his plank, swinging
over the abyss of that stone ditch,
plank resting on parapet, balanced by
weight of patriots, he hovers perilous
ly such a dove toward such an ark!
Deftly, thou shifty usher; one man al
ready fell, and lies smashed, down
there against, the masonry! Usher
Maillard falls not; deftly, unerring, he
walks, with outspread palm. The
Swiss holds a paper through his port
hole; the shifty usher snatches it and
refurns. Terms of surrender, pardon,
immunity to all! Are they accepted?
"Foi d'officier" (on the word of an of
ficer) answers half-pay Hulin, or half
pay Elie for men do not agree on it
"they are." Sinks the drawbridge.
Usher Maillard bolting it when down;
rushes in the living deluge; the Bas
tille is fallen! Victolre! La B.istille
est prise!"
Why dwell bn what follows. Hulin's
foi d'officier chculd have been kept,
but could not. The Swiss stand up,
disguised in white canvas smocks; the
invalides without disguise, their arms
all piled against the wall. The first
rush of victcrs, in ecstacy that the
death peril is passed, "leaps joyfully
on their necks," but new victors rush,
and ever new, also in ecstacy not whol
ly of joy. As we said, it was a living
deluge, plunging headlong; bad not the
Gardes Francaise in their cool, milita
ry way, "wheeled round with arms lev
eled" it would have plunged suicidally
by the hundred or the thousand, into
the Bastille ditch.
And so it goes, plunging through
court and corridor; billowing, uncon
trollable, firing from windows on it
self; in hot frenzy of triumph, of grief
and vengeance for its slain. The poor
invalides will fare ill; one Swiss, run
ning off in his white smock, is driven
back with a death thrust. Let all pris
oners be marched to the town hall to
be judged! Alas, already one poor in
valide has his right hand slashed off
him, his maimed body dragged to the
Place de Greve and hanged there.
This same right hand, it is said, turned
back De Launay from the powder mag
azine and saved Paris.
De Launay, "discovered in gray
frock with puppy colored ribbon," Is
for killing himself with the sword of
his cane. He shall go to the Hotel de
Ville, Hulin, Maiilard and ethers es
corting him. Elie marching first,
"with the capitulation paper on his
sword point." Through roarings and
cursing, through hustling, clutching
and at last through strokes! Your
escort Is hustled aside, fell down; Hu
lin sinks exhausted on a . heap ot
stones. Miserable De Launay! He
shair never enter the Hotel de Ville;
"rnly his bloody hair queue, held up in
a bloody hand." that shall enter, for a
sign. The bleeding trunk is on the
steps there the head if off through
. .. .. I
the streets, gnasiiy. aiou on a pine.
O evening sun of July, how, at this
hour, thy beams fall slant upon rea
ers amid peaceful, woody fields, on old
women spinning in cottiges, on ships
far out In the silent maih; on balls at
the orangerle of Versailles, where high
rouged dames of the palace are even
now dancing with double-jacketed hus
sar officers; and also on this roaring
hell porch of a Hotel de Ville!
Aloeg the streets of Paris circulate
seven Bastille prisoners, borne shoulder-high,
seven heads on pikes, the
keys cf the Bastille and much else.
See, also, the Gardes Francaises,
marching home to their barracks, with
the invalides and Swiss kindly enclos
ed In hollow square. Likewise, ashlar
stones of the laslille continue thun
dering through the dusk; its paper
archives shall fly white.
Tbo VoraniltpH ball and lemonade is

At ence he was arrested as a suspect

Attempts made by the Department
of Justice men to elicit his life history
prior to the time he shipped at South
Uend, Wash., met with failure.
He refused to say anything about
himself, except to cite his papers of
discharge, representing him to be
Swiss.

against bis obstinacy, Julius, as be
was known, was turned over to the
immigration department and taken to

he knew it he was discussing his child

Didn't Want To Fight Prussians
He began to pave the way to get In
to the army, if such a move was possi
ble. He claimed that he always had
been ready to enter either the military
or naval service of the United States,
conditionally. He should not be sent
against Prussians, because the blood
of Prussia flowed in his veins and he
refused to fight his relatives in the
ranks ot the kaiser's army. He claim

proper time to make himself known to
American officials, so that he could
demonstrate to their satisfaction his

he appeared to think would entitle

He claimed already to have benefited
his country by purloining from the

A Card to the Public
The Celery Vig Bottling Company desires to inform the citizens
why we require a $1.00 deposit on every case of bottles going out of
our plant.
IN THE FIRST PLACE, a case and two dozen soda bottles at the
present time cost us f. o. b. Bisbee $1.73 and cannot be replaced by
us for any less. The average profit on a case of soda does not exceed
25 cents and when we lose a case of bottles it takes the profit from
seven cases of soda and a thing of no value is not taken care of. That
is the reason that many small business concerns do not succeed.
Our business is built on business principles and we know the exact
cost of every case of goods that goes out of our plant and the exact
cost of the delivery of same and we figure only a reasonable percent
age of profit and one of our principal protection is our deposits on
our bottles and cases. This is a system that is followed throughout
the United States by all successful business houses. The Standard
Oil Company requires a deposit on its tanks, the Anheuser-Busch
Brewing Company requires a deposit on its cases and bottles and we
are all agreed that they are successful business institutions. A local
bottling plant must be conducted on the same principles if it is to be
successful.
The price of our labor has gone up jusf the same as the price of all
other labor, and everything we buy costs more than it did a 3'ear ago.
We have in addition a war tax to pay and any reasonable man should
recognise the fact that we cannot sell soda water at the price it was
sold for last year and pay expenses therefor, and give you a pure,
unadulterated, first-class article.
We purchased the Metz plant because we considered it unfair com
petition as we could not put up our class of goods in competition with
the Metz plant. We ask the support of the Bisbee public becaus-e we
have come here and invested our money in good faith. e will
always sell our goodi as cheaply as anyone else who manutctures
an article of th same high quality. We never have and never will
use saccharine or other poisonous sweetening substitutes.
Hoping tnat these few words will explain to your satisfaction the
situation in its true light and the necessity for following the course
we have adopted, we are ,

fl!v Review I-friwd Wlrol
WASHINGTON, July 13. National
prohibition legislation was postponed
by congress today until August 26, at
least. In arranging for a mid-summer
vacation, aformal unanimous consent
agreement was entered into by the
senate to defer until August 26 further
consideration of the $11,000,000 emerg
ency food producction bill, containing
the amendment or "bone dry" war
time prohibition effective New Years'
day. As a part of the agreement,
hovever, the prohibition advocate se
cured the definite pledge that the bill
shall have right of way when the va
cation recess period of the senate ends.
Senators on both sides of the frght
expressed complete satisfaction with
the arrangement, made after many
days spirited negotiation. The pro
hibition advocates are confident that
they have a majority to keep In the
bill some kind of a drastic war tine
production provision soon after the
vacation ends. Some senators heard
during the day that President Wilson
may take a hand in the fight next
month. This report said he favored
a proposal to give him the authority
and discretion to finally determine,
under all conditions, whether prohibi
tion is desirable, and is inclined to op
nose any action materially reducing in
ternal revenue.
SOLDIERS FORGE
SHIP CREWS TO
OBEYALL RULINGS
No Lights Must be Shown,
Was Order, so Watch Of-
ficer on Boat Was Arrested
By Soldier Sentries
LONDON, June 6. (Correspondence
of the Associated Press) Although
troop ships that bring over American
soldiers are so well protected that the
submarine menace is virtually negli
gible, submarines throughout the trip
are probably the chief subject of con
versation. Usually the references to
the undersea terror are Jocular, but it
Is apparent that much serious thought
is given to U-boats and that they loom
large in imagination. This applies to
officers as well as to the men. All say
frankly they have no desire for a brush
with the slinking enemy craft.
The reason for this was neatly put
by a major of inrantry who recently
landed In HSigland. "Fighting submar
ines," he said, "isn't our game. In
that pithy explanation he summed up
the soldier's attitude exactly.
Fighting the submarines Isn't the
army's game, and soldiers can't play It
because they don't know how. If their
ship is attacked there isiothlng for
them to do except march on deck and
prepare to take to the lifeboats. De
fensive measures rest with the trans
port's naval guns and with the escort
ing destroyers. They, as the soldier
sees it, have all the fun, while the sol
dier must stand by, eager to fight, but
helpless to take a hand.
The army officers feel keenly their
responsibility in such an unfamiliar
situation. It devolves upon them to
clear the ship of every man and get
them Into their proper boats.
. In order to do this with the greatest
possible celerity and precision, the
commanding military officer and bis
assistants carefully work out their
plans before the ship sails. On a large
vessel carrying several thousand
troops it is necessary to quarter the
men on all decks, some far down In the
vessel. The task, then, is to get them
all up on the boat deck with the least
delay and without confusion.
Boat drills begin soon after the ship
leaves port. Each man is assigned to
a particular boat, and it is highly Im
portant that when the troops, In re
sponse to the alarm signal, are moving
up from the lower decks that there be
no Interference and congestion on the
stairways.
The problem presents a number of
difficulties, each of which is studied
with care. So perfect was the system
employed on one big transport that
the 6,000 troops on board could be
brought from all parts of the ship to
their stations on the upper deck with
in less than five minutes.
When a transport approaches the
submarine zone, precautions are In
creased. All officers and men must
wear their life preservers constantly,
and when the ship has got well Into
the zone, orders are Issued for the men
to sleep in their clothes.
No lights, of course, are shown. To
guard against the inadvertent striking
of a match whose flare might reveal
the vessel's presence to a lurking sub
marine, no one is permitted on deck
after dark with the exception of the
ship's crew. Sentries are posted to
see that this order Is strictly obeyed.
An amusing incident occurred on a
huge British transport which was car
rying a particularly large number of
American soldiers.
About nine o'clock one evening,
while full speed was being made
through the heart of the zone, a sen
try noticed a ray of light playing in a
small circle on a distant part of the
deck which he was guarding. He call
ed another, sentry and together they
crept toward the point where the light
momentarily had appeared. The night
was very dark and at first the sen
tries could see nothing. Then they
made out the figure of a man bending
over the deck. They immediately
seized him and told him he was under
arrest.
"But I'm the watch offker In com
mand of the ship," the prisoner ex
claimed. "I huve to use a flashlight
for the work I'm doing here."
However, the sentries had their or
ders. They were to arrest anybody
that showed a light on deck. So their
captive protested in vain. The sol
diers called their officer of the dzy.
He decided to turn the prisoner over
to the ship's captain. Up to the bridge
the watch officer was taken and when
the captain saw and heard the details
he almost choked with laughter. It
will be a long time before the officer
is permitted to forget his arrest on his
own ship by American soldiers.

WHEAT PROGRAM IS
BEING ADJUSTED TO
Last Year's 70 Per Cent Rule
Revoked, Far as Millers Are
Concerned ; Domestic Rule
Depends Upon Reserve
fSnecHI to The Review)
FLAGSTAFF, July 13. The first
intimation of an adjustment of the
wheat conservation program of the
food administration to conform with
linuroved crop prospects was received
today by Timothy A. Riordan. federal
food administrator for Arizona, in tli
form of a telegram from the food ad
ministration, Washington.
This telegram revokes the so-called
70 per cent rule which has limited
the sale of wbeat by millers, whole
salers and Jobbers to 70 per cent of
their customers' requirements, as
b8sed on their purchases last year.
Whether the present excellent crop
prospects will Justify Increasing the
consumption of wheat products by in
dividuals now limited to six po-inds
per month, is still problematical.
Even though the coming harvest
should prove as bounteous as it prom
ises at this time, the food adminis
tration officials point out. there is
strong necessity for reserve stocks.
This Is Indicated in the following of
ficial statement given out by the
United States food administration.
"With the present prospects of a
very large wheat crop and with great
ly Increased acreage 'and favorable
conditions of all other cereals. Amer
ica has perhaps reached its high water
mark agriculturally during he war
and Is in a position to store up re
serves against the time when many
men now engaged in farming will be
needed for the army and for other
war work."
"The Importance of this reserva
tion is indicated by every cable re
ceived from Great Britain and Fit nee .
where reserves have been below the
danger roint for the last year. With
this demand upon us it is Impossible
for the United State even in the face
of good crops to relax to any extent
our measures of food conservation.
"With the coming of the 1918 har
vests our hope is to build up abroij
larre reserves of food as possible.
This does not necessarily mean im
mediate increases in consumption, but
It does mean that the morale of
France. England and Italy will be sup
ported bv the knowledge that In our
own country sufficient stores of food
exist to meet all contigencies."

JOIN THE MARINES
Who Are Always "the First to Fight"
'1 i!r:-f3
?ji;-f.lj
WHO THE MARINES ARE
United States Marines are often confused with sailors
of the Navy. They are not sailors they are soldiers!
When you see a soldier with a globe, anchor and eagle
on his hat, cap or helmet you may know that heV a
United Spates Marine. That's the distinguishing badge
the trade mark of his service ! It means that particular
soldier belongs to an organization that is almost always
mentioned in the same breath with the Foreign Legion,
the Pennsylvania State Constabulary, the Northwest
Mounted Police and the famous Texa3 Rangers. It
means that that particular soldier has received training
that fits him to fight on land, at sea, or possibly in the
air. It means that that particular soldier belongs to the
oldest regular military organization in the United States.
A colonel of the English army recently amazed his
hearerswhen he said, "The best equipped, organized,
and most efficient body of its size in the world is the
United States Marine Corps." An editorial in the Phila
delphia North American of August 30, I9l 7, compared
the United States Marine Corps with Caesar's own Tenth
Legion. "One can imagine that in recruiting his beloved
legion, the great Roman imposed'some such standards
of physical and mental worth as those which keep the
United States Marine Corps the pick of all the fighting
forces of this great Republic." i
ANTIQUITY OF THE CORPS
The United States Marine Corps was first called into
existence by an Act cf the Continental Congress of
November 1 0, 1 775, and gallantly served throughout the
Revolutionary War. It was disbanded at the close of
the war, April l l , 1 782, but was reorganized and per
manently established July l l, I 798. From that day to
this its officers and men have been zealous participants
in every, expedition and action in which the Navy has
engaged, and in many trying campaigns they have won
distinction with their brethren of the Army. It' is the
gallant little corps that has so ably assisted in fighting
America's battles in every corner of the globe for more
than a century. And the Marine Corps has ever been
true to its motto, "Semper Fidelis"' (Always Faithful).
REQUIREMENTS FOR ENLISTMENT
To enlisf in the Marine Corps an applicant must be
not less than five feet five inches, nor more than six feet
two inches in height; weigh not less than l 30 pounds
nor more than 245 pounds; not less than 18 nor more
than 36 years of age for enlistment as private; able to
speak, read and write the English language with ease;
native born or naturalized citizen of the United States;
steady r.nd regular habits; unmarried, with no one
wholly dependent upon him for support; of good health,
strong constitution, well formed, sound as to senses and
limbs, and not addicted to the use of intoxicant or drugs.
The prospective recruit must first pass a physical
examination by a naval surgeon and then undergo a
critical examination by the recruiting officer, who in
quires into his moral fitness and general desirability.
By these exacting examinations the undesirable men
are as far as possible eliminated, and only the best are
finally accepted and enlisted. All applicants at the re
cruiting station are treated with uniform courtesy and
consideration, and all who conform to the requirements
of the service in the Marine Corps will be given a fair
and impartial examination, the expense of such examin
ation being borne entirely by-the. Government.
. MINORS
Young men between the ages of 18 and 21, who pass
the necessary mental and physical examination, may be
enlisted as privates, without the consent of parents or
guardians. Minors of not lessthan 18 and not more
than 1 9 years of age who' may be accepted for enlist
ment as privates to learn the clrum and trumpet, will,
if subsequently found unsuitable for such duty, be re
tained for regular duty. 'All enlistments shall be made
for four years, or for the duration of the war.'
It sometimes happens that young men not yet 1 8
years old succeed in passing the examination by the en
listing officers by claiming to have reached that age. If
such a case is brought to the attention of Headquarters,
the boy becomes amenable to trial and punishment for
fraudulent enlistment. '
MEN WITHIN DRAFT AGE
Men within the draft age can enlist in the Marine
Corps provided they first get certificates from their Local
Boards stating that their class and order numbers are"
so far down on the list that they will not be called to
fill up the current quota and that the Local Board con-
sents to their enlistment in the Marine Corps. Men of
draft age should not apply for enlistment in the Marine
Corps until they are certain they can get such a certifi
cate from their Local Board.
" WHY YOU SHOULD ENLIST IF ELIGIBLE
The United States is not a military nation. We are
a peace-loving people, grimly determined to end the
business of war for all time to come. In this "war
against war" we assume that you wish to render most
efficient service, and, trained as a United States Marine,
you may render, efficient service as a signalman, engin
eer, infantryman, artilleryman, or go to sea and help
,sink the U-boats. Remember; not every man is fitted
to be a United States Marine. In fact, only one man in
, ten possesses the necessary qualifications. BUT YOU
MAY BE THAT ONE. Did that ever occur to you?.
Have you ever tried to enlist with the United States
Marines? 'Tis no disgrace to be rejected from them.
Hundreds of thousands have tried and failed, and, if you
are so fortunate as to be accepted, you'll always be giad
you trjed. Or, if rejected for any reason, you'll be glad
you tried anyway: Not every man is a Marine, "but
every Marine is a man "a rip-roarin' he-man" as John
D. Wells, managing editor of the Buffalo Evening News,
wrote recently. Assert your manhood and go around to
the recruiting station today. (
FOOD
Every care is taken to insure the serving of only the
best and most wholesome food to the enlisted men cf the
Marine Corps. The foodstuffs are purchased under con
tract, and all articles are critically inspected by the com
missary officer before acceptance by the Government.
Each and every meal is carefully inspected by the. Offi
cer of the Day to see that the fcod is properly cooked
and served before the men are permitted to eat it. This
is intended to insure that men receive nothing but whole
some and substantial food.
CLOTHING
All necessary clothing is furnished free by the Gov--ernment
uniforms, shirts, socks, underwear, shoes,
etc., are provided by the Government. The recruit need
take nothing with him on his journey to the Recruit
Depot other than a few toilet articles such as soap,
towels, toothbrush, etc., which he will find useful on the
train. The civilian clothing he wears can be sent bacn.
home from the Recruit Depot by parcel post or express.
HOSPITAL FUND
The sum of twenty cents a month is deducted from
the pay of every officer and enlisted man in the service
and ap plied to the Hospital Fund. The remaining cost
of maintaining excellent hospitals, hospital ships, med
ical and surgical stores, and a corps of doctors, many of
whom are specialists, is borne by the Government. Rel
atives need have no anxiety as regards medical attend
ance for men of the Marine Corps.
. PAY AND ALLOWANCES
The regular pay of Marines varies from $30 to $75
a month, according to rank and length of service. A
man starts in as a private at $30 a month and climbs up
in accordance with hu own merits and individual efforts.
, A man is given a "Good Conduct Medal" for each en
listment he serves honestly and faifhfully, and for each
good conduct medal that he holds he receives 83 cents
a month in addition to his regular pay. Should he qual
ify with the service rifle his pay will be increased $2 a
month for "Marksman." $3 a month for "Sharpshooter,"
or $5 a month for "Expert Rifleman," according to
which of these qualifications he attains. Likewise if he
qualifies with the great guns aboard ship his pay is in
creased from $2 tc $10 a month, according to his qual-
, ification and the class of gun at which he is stationed.
While serving aboard ship, or on shore outside of the
United States (except in Hawaii and Porto Rico), his
pay is increased 20 per cent. A comparatively small
percentage of the men in the service draw the minimum
pay.
OPPORTUNITIES FOR ADVANCEMENT
During the period of the war all commissions if! the
Marine Corps will go to worthy enlisted men. If you
would be a commisisoned officer in the Corps you must
first enter the ranks. The Napoleonic idea that every
private soldier carries a marshal's baton in his knapsack
is literally true in the Marine Corps and all the higher
ranks are open to worthy young men of character and
ability. Vacancies are constantly occurring in the non
commissioned grades, and men are selected to fill them
in accordance with their records, individual merits, and
ability to perform the duties of the higher positions.
Encouragement and opportunity are given to young men
of good character and ability to remain in the service and
climb to the higher positions of trust and honor.
One hundred enlisted men ae picked from the Marine
Corps and Navy each year, by competitive examination,
to be sent to the Naval Academy ft Annapolis. Md.
there to be educated and trained as officers, and, upon
graduation! they will be commissioned in the Marine
.Corps or Navy.
The law also provides for the promotion of non-commissioned
officers to the warrant rank in the grades cf
rrarine gunner and quartermaster clerk. Such officers
receive from approximately $1125.00 to $2500.00 a
year and are entitled to the same privileges of retirement
as warrant officers of the Navy. The number of warrant
officers of the Marine Corps is not very large and ap
pointment to warrant rank is restricted to competent and
worthy non-commissioned officers.

WAGE RAISE CAME ABOUT

SULT DESIRED . BY EVERYONE
IN MINING FIELDS
SETS FUTURE PACE
METAL PRODUCERS BREAK
ABOUT EVEN NEITHER GAINING
NOR LOSING ON FORMER RE
TURNS FROM COPPER METAL IS
PREDICTION MADE NOW
, In the recently announced wage
advance announced for workers in
the copper industry during the
week there was culmination of
effort exercised by employers and
employes with the assistance of
each other to secure an advance
in the price of copper that would
. enable a higher wage scale.
Making the cooperative effort of
the employers and employes in the
matter still more binding and con
sequently drawing them into more
complete understanding and sin
gleness of purpose to get maximum
results during the war period, was
the fact that they jointly took
counsel of the federal labor de
partment and of the presideit's
mediators. Judge Hywell Davies,
who was the active advisor in the
Arizona conference at Jerome and
elsewhere in advance of the in
creased wage announcement, hat -further
credit given him from
Montana, where Butte newspaper
reports indicate that it was his
advice to operators and operatives
which brought about the advance
of fifty cents the shift which was
announced there last week and
which smoothed out problems that
had come up and put the copper '
Industry operators and operatives
on a cordial and more effective
footing for top efficiency than had
prevailed in more than a year.
Sets Future Pace '
While various occurrences signifying
the cooperation of employer and em
ploye in Arizona have had comment
and have been demonstrated In the
higher output of metal, no instance
has had quite the significance that ap
pears to be given to the success of
their joint endeavor for a higher wage,
and none has seemed to carry as much
promise of lasting benefits in per
manently better understanding and
continued use of the foundation which
has been put down for Joint endeavors
in the pood interests of each.
Arizona Wage Advance
Fifty cents the shift was added to
the Arizona copper industry employe's
wage under the decision of the week.
The advance dates from July 1 and
will continue at least to August 15,
until which time the government has
filed the price of copper at 26 cents.
The wage advance corresponds with
that adopted in Montana as to amount,
but is a more liberal advancff-on the
part of the Arizona copper producers
for the reason that Montana freight
charges and most other costs are low
er than in Arizona.
Metal Advance Apportionment
In making advance in wages the cop
per producers have possibly broken
about even, neither gaining of losing
from the 23 cent price. It may work
out that they have obtained a slight
advantage over the 23 cent price,
but if so it is a much less portion than
the employes in the industry are gain
ing. Of the 2Vt cent increase from
23 cents, a little more than 1 1-4
cents, it is figured. Is taken ud by the
increase in freight rates which be
came effective on June 25th. The
eastern refineries it is now indicated,
will get cent increase on their con
tracts, which is considerably less than
they expected. The wage advance rep
resents a little more than 3-4 of a cent.
That makes a total of 2 cents and
absorbs all of the increase. It is con
sidered an ultra conservative estimate
of increase in costs, at that. The on
ly possible chance for the producers
to get a profit instead of a loss out of
the 26 cent price, indeed, is in the
freight Increase estimate. It may Te
that when it is all segregated and
properly charged that it will be found
that the advance will trim down to
1 cent. In that event the producers
would have 1-4 cent coming to them
on the advance in the metal price as
against the 3-4 to the employe in the
industry and cent to the refiner in
the east. Should the producer get the
1-4 cent he will have to divide It with
the government on tax payments, so
that the most he can look to is an
eighth of a cent gain, w ith the chances
more favorable to its proving to be
that much of an actual loss from the
old 23V. cent price.
Situation Encouraging Nevertheless
There is a gain, nevertheless. It is
ORTS
in the better circumstances made for
labor and in the greater encourage
ment to the worker and the investor
to believe that higher metal is not a
forlorn hope and that development
and production are winning the
thoughtful consideration which has
been earnestly fought for and will, per
haps speedily now, result in such con
inns as will enable everybody to
dig for petal with fair profit.
imtvtui Tor ueve DDmcni
The snap which went out of plans
for new development and increased
general activities when the price of
copper failed of advance in the early
June meeting, is already in evidence
as coming back with more than the
strength it had. The latter was Dasea
on ocssibilities, while an actual ad
vance' is now at hand. Financial writ
ers assert that there is no lack or mon
ey in the country for investment in
wiHmate war industries, and that
along with the money there is the spir
it of desire to help increase resources
tknt i npcessArv to fighting just as
long and just as hard as occasion may
require. The truth cf this explains
much in association with unbroken de
velopment work which has been pur
sued on 'many Arizona properties
hirh are hv wav of either proving up
new mineral areas or putting them in
the discard. This work has not suf
fered from lack of money or oi entnu
siasm. It will get more of each, nat
urally, from now on.
No Abatement of fefton
In ihe established districts among
h larre nrnducers there has been no
abatement of development and con
struction which will assist luiure pro
duction, renewing reserves of ore and
providing for more and more equip
ment having the purpose of increasing
efficiency in the recovery of values.1
The big producers have been doing all
possible in these respects regardless
of metal price, transportation difficul
ties, embargoes and all else. They
realize the great need of providing
against the future in the utmost, as
well as of taking care ot tne immeoiaie
present at top capacity. They have
handled the double engagement wun
every energy and resource they have;
been able to command.
Getting the Ore
Although the first half of the year
haa broken no records in the matter of
underground development work- in
proven ore areas, the rootage Deing
behind the normal because of the great
sr offnrt that has had to be given with
lesser forces and depleted technical
ranks to the digging oi ore, mere iyis
hMi nnrl is wine done a great deal
of development that is earning much
encouragement. This is true in tne
Warren district, the Globe-Miami dis
trict, the Verde district and all others.
In the Warren district there have been
no important new discoveries, but
there has been steady picking up of
ore of very satisfactory grade and
some findings which may be reason
ably expected to develop important
things as they are pursued. Copper

C. & A, PRODUCTION
OF PRECIOUS METAL
GREAT ONE III YEAR
It ia announced Calumet and Arizo
na production or metals other than
copper had value in the last year of
within $120,000 of that of the total out
put of the largest precious metals
mine In the state. United Eastern.
Gross receipts from the latter's out
put, according to returns just given
out, was $l,m.ll7.33. C. & A.'s metals
other than copper had value of $1,706
695.03. Large as the latter sum looks
at first glance, however, it will prob
ably lack a couple hundred thousand
dollars of sufficient to cover the feder
al taxes of the company for the year.
United Eastern's output was of gold
and represented about one-third of the
total gold mined in the state. Calumet
& Arizona's output other than copper
covered gold, silver, lead, manganese
and some other metals, and sulphuric
acid. Of the latter it will have double
the output this year that it had last,
when its plant was built and had but
six months operation. Manganese will
also probably cut a considerably larg
er figure in C. & A. output of metal oth
er than copper the present year, al
though it was an Important item in
th Hr for 1917. The comDanv Dlon-
j eered the way In development of this
I war metal in Arizona, as well as in-re-j
Hef of the war demand for sulphuric
'acid. Its research for manganese
brought about activities In the Warren
I district w hich have kept it In the lead
in the state as a producer of the much
needed metal and which had a great
deal to do with advancing Arizona to
place second only to Montana in out
put of manganese, with outlook at this
time favoring its taking the lead from
Montana next year.

DAVIS-DALY RESERVES
BIGGEST IN HISTORY
BUTTE, Mont., July 13. Ore re
serves in the Colorado mine of the
Davis-Daly Copper company are the
largest of any time in the history of
that corporation. No tonnage estimate
is given, but it is stated that the ore
body in the Hesperus vein on three
levels, the 2500, the 2400 and the 2300
has been opened for a distance in ex
cess of 700 feet, and that the ore is
strong in the breasts on the three lev
els on which drifting is in progress.
For a length of 400 feet on the 2300,
no stoping even has begun and com
paratively little ground has been stop
ed on the 2500, the highest work floor
of the stopes there being the tenth, for
a distance along about 100 feet. Many
of the other stopes extend upward
four or five blocks.
The 1400-foot level is producing a
good tonnage of second class ore and
it is intimated among the Colorado
miners that a new ore body of consid
erable width has been opened on this
level, in addition to the Hesperus de
posit, which is from 8 to 10 feet wide
cf 4 per cent ore. Information as to
the new ore body is not available at
the present time, but from such advic
es as it is possible to get, another
promising fissure has been opened
with indications of good tonnage of
commercial ore.

Phelps Dodge
Manganese Production to
Make New Record in July
Manganese shipments from the properties of the Phelps Dodge cor
poration are being (spurred as greatly as possible, in an effort to furnish
the government as much of this valuable ore for steel hardening as possi
ble. Last month's shipments mude to the Tennessee Coal & Iron company
at its reduction wrks in Alabama, was 600 tons. It is hoped this month
to ship 1000 tons dtring July; possibly more. .
Development in Uie copper bearing zones of the company's mines here
has been subordinated during the last year to rushing production in order
to furnish that higlilr needful metal to the government in its time of stress.
However, interestin : developments have taken place, chiefly in 'proving

SPLENDID EXAMPLE
The pace set by Calumet & Ari
zona smelter at Douglas in the re
covery of sulphuric acid is likely of
important emulation by other Ari
zona smelters just as soon as there
is the assurance that transportation
facilities to markets for the acid
will be made permanently available
by the railroads.
If Arizona smelters were at this
time recovering the sulphuric acid
that it is possible for them to con
serve, they would have available
for the markets west of the Missou
ri river all that they could make
uso of for fertilizer manufacture,
the manufacture of explosives and
every other purpose, federal or pri

450 STARS IN
P. D. SERVICE
FLAGTO DATE
Company Compiling Statistics
and Soon Separate Flag for
Each Flag and Department
Will be Flying in Breeze
Were the Warren district to display
a service flag, the . Copper Queen
branch of the Phelps Dodge corpora
tion would occupy a proud position,
for at least 450 stars and probably
many more, would be in the field, rep
resenting former employes who are
now fighting the battle of eir coun
try in Europe, on the high seas, or still
are in training in America preparatory
to going to the front. Most of these
are men between 21 and 31 years of
age whose 'services were particularly
valuable in mine operations.
It is the intention of the Phelps
Dodge company soon to compile a list
of the men who have gone to the front
and t0 celebrate their patriotic sacri
fice by displaying service flags at the
various shafts where they formerly
were employed. This was learned in
an interview with Gerald Sherman,
superintendent of the P. D. corpora
tion. - ''
The company does not intend to dis
play one huge flag at the general of
fice, as was proposed some time ago.
In the first place, the flag would be
too large and unwieldy for the pur
pose; again the patriotic impulse that
will be imparted by the display of a
service flag at evey point from which
men have gone, would be lost.
The intention now is to obtain a
complete catalogue of names of those
who have left here since the declara
tion of war against Germany and over
the shaft, or company department
where they were employed, a service
flag will be flown, with a separate
star for each such employe.
A partial count of employes who now
are members of the armed forces of

THE JOHNSON DISTRICT
FORGING AHEAD

Mines Increasing Output
JOHNSON. Ariz.. July 12. It may be
of interest to know tliat Johnson, in
cluding the Golden Rule and Middle
March mines, produced in the year
1916. more than $6,000,000. something
like three-fourths of a million in silver,,
the balance being copper.
It is also a fart not generally rec
ognized that the district embraces one
of the largest If not the largest tung
sten producing areas in the country.
The tungsten area includes Russelville
and "Texas Canyon," in fact, all of the
country west for many miles, from
Dragoon station.
Many men are now employed In this
section; the ores are scheelite and hu
berite occurs in quartz veins, the larg
er part of the output, however, being
recovered from placers.
The country is dry, except in a few
localities where there is plenty of wat
er only for domestic purposes. Only
for lack of water the district wouTd
rival in output of tungsten ores any
section known.
Mr. Harmer, of New York, and the
"moving spirit" of the Arizona-United
company, is in camp, shaping up af
fairs preparatory to taking over the
property operated tby the Cobriza com
pany. The incoming company contem
plates much development work and is
well prepared for it, financially and
with equipment that will enabie the
company to thoroughly explore the
property, at the same time maintain
the usual output In shipments to the
smelters.
Martin Fishback. E. M.. has just com
pleted a survey of the property of the
Peabody Consolidated mines. It la cur
rent report that extensive development
work on the property is contemplated.
The company recently installed a pow
er plant, hoist and compressor, at cost
of near $20,000. The mine has a splen
did record, the gross output totaling
several million dollars, and. all above
250 feet in depth. Such a showing cer
tainly warrants further exploration, a
fact which the present owners seem
to realize.
The Keystone is installing new hoist
and air equipment on the O. K. mine,
a section of the Keystone group. De
velopment on this property has been
in progress for a number of years;
gradual improvement has been marked
from the beginning with the result that
now adequate equipment only is neces
sary to bring the property in as one
of the steady and profitable producers
of the district.
Dragoon Mountain copper is gradu
ally opening up new ore with conse
quent increase in shipments each
month, the June output having exceed
ed that of May by 50r;. Preparations
are being made to sink to a depth of
300 feet on the west end of the Cop

a mine, all within itself; some SO or
more cars of ore have been shipped
from this point. A raise to connect all

Although production so far Is sub

In July and August only S75.000 pounds
were produced owing to the strike at
the company's mines. As a matter of
fact, output did not really get back to

that the strike made a few days ago
is of a sensational order.
The vein which was tapped on t'.i
400-foot level a short distance from
the shaft, was crosscut for fifteen feet,
and a drift was run on Cie vein for 22
feet. It contains streak carrying
from 300 to as high as 1200 ounces of

chunks of the ore brought back to

pany is now puzzled whether to ship
this high grade ore to El Paso or the

It is believed that this is a continu

SILL STRINGERS
CUT 111 sine
Oil VERDE C0!1
Small stringers of the best ore ever
found at the Verde Combination have
been cut in sinking the shaft. They
show prominently at 1080 feet, where
a station is now being cut, and are to
be chased both east and west from that
point
The values occur as bornite, and
chalcopyrlte, chiefly the latter. In a
porphyrite schist. One picked sample
assayed a few days ago ran IS per cent
in copper; another assayed 20.6 pel1
cent .
These stringers may mean nothing
or they may mean a great deal. Sim
ilar streaks have often pinched out
but on the other hand they frequently
widen out into real ore bodies. At
the Combination they could well be
feeders to a big ledge. They appar
ently pitch toward the ledge partially
developed on the 700-foot level by
drift No. 13.
When the station at the 10S0 is fin
ished drifts will be started both east
and west on the stringers and a cross
cut will be driven to the north to in
tersect the No. 13 ledge.
It has been planned to resume un
derground development at a depth of
1100 feet but the cable would not car
ry the shaft any farther than that and
it was necessary to use the lower
twenty feet for a sump. An effort wa
made to purchase a longer cable but
delivery could not be secured within
a reasonable time so Mandgr Dave
Morgan decided to start drifting and
crosscutting at 1080.
SILVER KING STRIKE
QUITE SENSATIONAL
(Continued from Pace Ona)
erintendent of the Silver King about
25 years ago when it was a great pro
ducer. Silver became so depreciated
in price that it became unprofitable to
mine the low-gTade ore.. The old com
pany refused to put up any more mon
ey to develop the property and Major
Doran was wired to close it down. Be
ing confident that he was nearlng a
new ore body at that time, the major,
to satisfy his own curiosity, worked
his force a few days longer, and bis
judgment was confirmed in striking a
larger and richer body cf ore than had
ever before been opened up. He bulk
headed up the ore, covered it with
waste, and the secret of its location
remained with his to the day of his
death. The mine was shut down until
two years ago when a new company
. acquired the property. Major Doran
who related the above facts to the
writer, stated that the new company
offered to pay him $1,000 if he would
go to the mine and point out the U
cation of the hidden treasure. He ac
cepted the offer and was waiting in
Prescqtt for the money to be sent to
him when he was stricken with an Ill
ness which proved fatal.
The old workings were abandoned
by the present company after an at
tempt to use them was found to be im
practicable, and the present discovery
was made through a new shaft It is
not improbable, however, that the
present big strike is on the same vein
that was opened by Major Doran in
the old workings at a greater depth.
The Silver King is located, in the
Superior district, Pinal county. It has
quite a number of stockholders in Ya
vapai county who purchased shares
about two years ago at $1.
been constantly rising costs for all
supplies, together with rising wages.
The latest advance of course hits the
deve)oping concerns all over the state
a hard jolt. They have nothing com
ing in; everything going out. None of
them but know that the mine making
process is a long and hard pull at best;
that it costs a lot of money to get
around underground and that a great
deal of it must be done. They are ac
cepting this raise as they have those
in the past, philosophically, with in
creased energy to get at the resources
they expect to find underground and
with advice to those who have provid
ed financial support that they too will
have to pick up a larger part of the
effort. It would be just and desirable
if there could be a way found to allow
the developing concern immunity from
the higher costs that the producing
concerns are required to assume, but
there seems no way to accomplish this.
The small operator can get labor and
supplies only by paying just as much
as the large operator. Meantime the
Increased ore resources which the de
veloping concerns are striving to make
available in the different districts are
much needed as guarantee for the fut
ure and would be exceedingly desirable
for immediate usage in the face of the
shortage which prevails in metals in
all of the markets. Reports from va
rious districts that few suspensions
are occuring and that determination
to keep ahead just as long and as fast
as possible is uppermost, is therefore
doubly encouraging.
For Developing Areas
It fs true that the the immediate
time there is more outside mineralized
country under development giving
promise of large results than at any
period in some yearg". There is the
Cunningham Pass country in the Sa
lome area, the San Xavier district in
the Tucson country, the Yeager can
yon section In which Shannon Copper
Co. is making encouraging headway,
the Key Copper section in which Unit
ed Eastern interests believe they have
the making of a big camp. The main
enterprise in these localities are amp
ly financed and have engineering skill
and patriotic determination to add to
the country's war time resources and
to prepare for its needs after the war,
as well as the incentive of discovery
and the wresting of success therefrom.
The general combination is one from
which much more should grow than
normal times and conditions might
produce.

being made which extend high encour

Based on the June rate of produc
tion. Old Dominion for twelve months
would benefit approximately $3 per
share by the increase in the price ot
copper from 23Vi to 26" cents per
pound. As half the year is over this
would -mean that for the ' last six
months the company ought to add ap
proximately $1.50 per share.' This,
however, is based on output at the rate
cf 3S.000.000 pounds per annum, where
as the company will in all probability
exceed this amount. It would not be
surprising if the last half of the year
added $2 additional to share profits.

L. C. Shattuck, of the Shattuck Ari
zona Mining company, and of the Min
ers & Merchants bank, left Friday for
Chicago and other eastern points on a
business trip. While waiting for a
train in Douglas he was interviewed
by a reporter on the Douglas Interna
tional and the 'following is the story:
'L. C. Shattuck, the prominent
banker, cattleman and miner of Bis
bee, passed through Douglas last
night on his way to Chicago on a busi
ness trip. He reports that the Shac
tuck mine in the Warren district could
use more competent miners aud there
by increase tne output, but in this
connection averred that good miners
were aliady at work so tar as his in
lormation extended throughout the
country. The Dcnn mine, he said, is
now a regular producer and last
month yielded about 250,000' pounds
of copper. Mr. Shattuck is a large
stockholder in both the Shattuck aud
Denu companies. S
"Waiting tor ,the train this oldtimer
grew remeniscent and told of ciuing
to Arizona in. 1881; for a time he pros
pected in the vicinity of Tucson whea
he was not making his get away from
the Indians which were very danger
ous in those days. Shattuck carried
his entire worldly possessions when
he came into Tucson on a Mexicac
burro. He and a companion camped
to the west ot the city and he said
that when he would go to the busi
ness center of thejold town he passed
west on Meyer street. The Palace
hotel had just been completed on that
thoroughfare; the building was of
brick and the only structure then iu
Tucson built of brick. Shattuck said
that sometimes his visits to Tucson
found him about out of funds and
bacon and that then he often wonder
ed if he would ever have money
enough to pay a- hotel bill in such a
hotel as the Palace.
'From Tucson he madd his way to
Tombstone, during the lively times
there. He packed his worldly goods
into the bonanza camp-on his faithful
burro and decided that he would give
up prospecting for a time and see
what he could do with a miner's drill.
He went to work for one of the min
ing companies aud it was not long un
til he secured a business opportunity
and began to dispense beer and otjier
liquid refreshments to the thirsty
miners, gamblers and rustlers who
then made up the population there.
"Now Lem Shattuck is one of the
wealthiest men in the state and
though he- has been in Arizona for
thirty-six years he is hale and. hearty
and filled with energy.
"Asked about politics in the Warren
district .he said that there was much
enthusiasm there among the demo
crats over the candidacy of Hon. Fred
Sutter for governor. Ho said thai
Sutter would get a great vote in Bis
bee and that he believed the county
would go almost solid for the Bisbee
candidate."

THREE
News of Social Circles
Judge Lockwood of Tombstone spoke
In Bisbee at the Y. V. C. A. to the
women of the district. The subject
was "Girl Welfare" and work that
might be done here In the Warren dis
trict along these lines. It is as ubject
that calls for much thought and con
sideration and Judge Lockwood is well
capable of throwing much light upon
this serious proposition that confronts
Bisbee nfothers.
The cases that come under his not
ice in the Juvenile court are many and
interesting of the delinquent girls. And
this meeting was held for the purpose
of devising seme moans in which these
young girls may be reached before
they reach the hands of the law.
'Judge Lockwood thinks that the so
lution of this problem lies with the
women of the district, the teachers
and the Young Women's Christian As
sociation. He goes on to state that
the minds of these young girls are
plastic and their early training may
be counteracted by the proper consid
eration now. That no matter how
much a man may have studied the
question he never understands the up
bringing of a girl as a woman does. So
the responsibility rests with the moth
er, and if she doesn't kn6w, with the
Christian women of the district.
It is a deplorable fact when girl3 are
raised in ignorance, which used to
mean innocence. They just get a
smattering of the most vital questions,
and as the old proverb goes, "a little
learning is a dangerous thing." The
day has passed when the lackof know
ledge along certain lines is considered
a good up bringing. Judge Lockwood
says that the confidence of a girl
should be the most sought after tljing
by a mother. Get her confidence and
keep it so that she may come to you
with anything. When these poor un
fortunate girls are brought into the
courts, Judge Lockwood says, their
one cry is, "If I had only known." The
proper home surroundings are a great
part of the battle, but parents never
hold up bad ideals for their children
to pattern after, no indeed, they give
them clothing, food and a little school
ing, but not that all essential thing,
amusement, and they must have com
panionship. A certain amount of amusement to
the growing girl is as necessary as the
sunshine is to a flower so says Judge
Lockwood. If mothers don't realize
this and make an effort, a great ef
fort to afford them this entertainment,
then they will surely go elsewhere for
it. The public dances will be a big
drawing card. The mothers must be
made to realize this before it is too
late.
Some of the specific facts that
Judge Lockwood quotes from the Ju
venile court reports. First, that the
public dance hall is an unmixed evil.
Any man, good, bad or indifferent, fre
quent these dances, unquestioned, and
ask any girl that lie chooses to dance
with him. Nearly every girl that has
come up before the courts has had the
public dance as a beginning. The bo
' Iuttoirlrlfivitattona! dances," properly
chaperoned at the high school and in i
the homes and at the Y, must be en
couraged. It is utterly foolish to take
these things from a girl and not sub
stitute some nice clean diversion.
Then second, moving picture shows.
Only wholesome pictures should be
permitted young .g'rls to see at this
delicate age, where the mind is very
impressionable and love and vampire
pictures have their effect. The emo
tional side develops as well as the
physical and mental, so only the right
ideas of life must be instilled in the
young mind. Not that the moving pic
tures of Bisbee are in the least corrupt
Judge Lockwood says, but all pictures
should be censored before the younger
generation should be permitted to view
them. Girls who go out to the movies
every night fall behind in their studies
and make poor students generally. A
reasonable amount of moving picture
going to the right kind of pictures is
all well and good and will be uplifting
and educational.
Then third, the soldier question,
most of the young men in the army
today are honest and upright, not as
In the past, when the army was a ref
uge for every derelict. And these sol
diers have been used to seeing girls
and being entertained which is per
fectly natural that they should wish
to continue doing so. This is to be
expected but only with the proper
chaperons. Association, propinquity
and environment without a chaperon
will surely mean trouble. Companion
ship and entertainment are necessary
to the happiness of youth but a rea
sonable amount, says Judge Lockwood
I'lans must be made and worked out
to permit these young people to meet
and enjoy each other without meeting
at the public dance or on the street
corners. It isn't altogether the girls
fault that these things come to pass
for without the proper entertainment
other means will be sought to obtain
it.
It is up to the mothers and teachers
of the Warren district to save these
Until the end of the war we must
found our wardrobes on wartime in
comes. Women must continue to
dress well, but with economy. They
will discover the fabrics that wear
well but still manage to stay within
the fashions. The day has passed
when women used to buy several
gowns of the same type, now only one
of a type is purchased with great
thought and care. One gown can be

On the night of the 4th of July, Mrs.
A. E. Douglas entertained .the Tucson
contingent who are here Working in
the Bisbee schools. The evening was
given to afford an opportunity for the
young teachers to meet Miss Gregg,
one of the assistant .superintendents
of the Bisbee schools. A program was
given, vocal solos by Miss Leonore

Owing to the fact that the new quo
ta for garments has i just arrived, anC
the articles are entirely different from
these that have been made, new work
cannot be started until patterns and
materials have arrived. The new quo
ta is BOO day shirts, 300 boys suits, 300
girls drawers and 300 petticoats.
This change in work is done with the
idea in view to make women equal' to
any branch of the sewing. That all
workers who make surgical dressing
must be capable tn the sewing rooms,
that they must learn to be of use in
all departments. A mobile force must
be developed in the production depart
ment of the chapter who can be turn
ed from one line of work to another,
it will enable the women to answer
any call that may be made upon them
and do their full duty in the war. For
instance a larger call might be made
for a large quantity of surgical dress
ings and less of garments or vice versa
And manufacturing ability must be de
veloped to furnish what is wanted
when it is wanted. As soon as the
new patterns arrive this new work
will i4 started.

fashionable as they are very beautiful.
The prices of these silks have remain
ed the same while others are soaring.
They are durable and practical al
though of unusual shades, with a soft
lustre and a strength and firmness or
texture that is not found In ordinary
silks. The marking is extremely orig
inal and very attractive. A soft Chin
ese brocade crepe Is like a lovely qual
ity of oharmeuBe, though with a dull
finish like crepe de chine. The Bro
cades are shown in small simple de
signs as well as in large elaborate
spots.
An afternoon gown of Oriental silk
is made in dull gold color. The
straight and simple tilouse is made
with a high neck the same at back and
front, long, tight sleeves and a turn
over collar of bisque batiste run with
embroidery and edged with filet lace
only add to the simplicity of the bod
Ice. The skirt is less simple as it
drapes about the figure and forms an
uneven full tunic at the back. The
material is elaborate in Itself, but del-
icately so, and the total effect is charm
lng. A gown made from this material
is not cheap, but a splendid economy
as it will last for several seasons.
Another of shantung, also a Chinese
fabric, but only the natural color of
pongee. Trimmed with touches of ma
hogany colored crepe de chine. It op
ens at the side and is finished with
shantung covered buttons which are
also used on the sleeves. A collar of
the shantung is lined with crepe de
chine and is cleverly draped so that
half is dark and half is light. Loose
panels at each side of the skirt are
lined with the darker shade, giving a
charming contrast with a new form of
trimming. The long waisted bodice
which wrinkles at the waist is very
new and becoming to the average fig
ure. Another most unusual silk comes
from the Orient a wide Yuzen dyed
crepe with a design of indefinite
stripes of olive and peacock blue with
tiny green leaves and bright red this
tles scattered over its surface. A very
simple design for making must be
used as it is very fancy in Itself. Lines
on the order of a summer suit, little
jacket like bodice buttons In front and
is belted with a narrow ribbon in a
matching shade tied simply at the back
The skirt bangs !n deep elightly circu
lar tucks. Fine Chinese batiste makes
the plain gilet, which like the gown is
bound in cordings of the material.

WEEKLY NEWS LETTER YOUHG
HEN'S CHRISTIAN ASSOCIATION
OF WARREN MINING DISTRICT
The following letter was turned over
to Secretary Morley by Mr. Richard
son before his departure for Nashville,
Tenn: "Dear Mr. Richardson: I have
intended writing you for some time a
little letter for your Y. M. news in the
Sunday edition of the Review, but I
have been waiting to make good first,
so I have made a good start in that di
rection for the time I have been here,
as I will tell you later on In this writ
ing. It has been rumored to me that
there was a report prevalent in Bisbee
that I had died of pneumonia. Well,
you see, it is not necessary for me to
correct the report, as I am very much
alive and have been since being in
this great institution, "the army of
Uncle Sam," and it Is becoming the
most formidable work of man on the
face of God's green earth, and I don't
remember the day when I was more
physically and mentally fit than I am
now, as we are taught accuracy, dis
patch and system. Now, It may be of
interest to you and my friends just
what I have been doing and observed
since I landed here on March the
sixth. ' I shall never forget the night
I stepped from' the train into a mili
tary camp at Fort Riley, Kansas. It
was about 10:00 p. m. and a cold gale
sweeping over the plains of Kansas at
the rate of twenty miles an hour, and
I had on the Bisbee' climate wearing
apparel, which was my "B. V. D's," and
a very thin cravenet. There I was
greeted by a number of officers that
lined me up with about four hundred
men that were drafted from New Mex
ico. Among them were Mexicans, In
dians and half-breeds. They lined us
up In sets of fours and marched us up
to a stable that was used by the cav
alry, but had been abandoned. On the
way up to this stable, you could hear
some sergeant yell out, "get in step
you look like a bunch of Bheep." Well,
after keeping us waiting there for sev
eral hours, it seems, they marched us
over to the supply department for
equipment. It was easily two miles
from the "horse shed" as we called it.
So when we returned, we had to go
to another place and fill our "straw
tick" with wheat straw, and by the
time we got back It was 3:00 in the
morning. So they made us get up at
6:00 and get ready for breakfast Not
going further Into those details from
that on for at least two weeks, it was
drill drill, and then some. That was
while we were in detention. Then
next comes the medical end ' of it,
which was lectures on anatomy, phy
siology, materia medica, pharmacy,
first aid, nursing, sanitation, and mil
itary laws. My personal experience
has varied to a great degree, as I will
relate the major part of it First I
gave a lecture course on materia med
ica, and pharmacy for two months of
three hours a week. Then they sent
me to a school for three weeks for
special instructions In X-Ray work,
and next I was put In the Base Hos
pital headquarters' dispensary to
learn all the routine pharmacy work
of the army, and I remained there for
just about four weeks. Now I am do
ing miscellaneous work for Evacuation
Hospital No. 16 at Camp Meade, Mary
land. As to my promotions since be
ing here, I will mention as well. I came
in as a "buck private" then first-class
private, then corporal, and lastly ser
geant of Evacuation Hospital No. 16,
at Camp Meade. Now I want to tell
you some of the Institutions that are
doing a very good work to hold the
morals of the soldier, and that is the
Y. M. C. A., Red Cross, Y, W C A and
K, C. But for me, give me the Y. M..
as I believe it la doing as much if not
more than any of them. Every man
in the army is getting big benefits
from it and it is going to open the
minds of many young men after the
war that have always had something
to say about it disrespectfully, and the
only draw back is that there are not
enough of them as they never seat
and accomodate all of the men. The
dollar goes farther in the Y. M. C. A.
than any of the Institutions. Well.
Mr. Richardson, I could write much
more had I ample time for It. I am
sorry to learn that you are leaving the
good HtUe town of Bisbee. Give my
regards to all of the boys and tell
them the next time I see them I can
talk French to them. Your friend.

ies. AMERICA'S COMING OF AGE
By Dr. Frank Crane
This Fourth of July, 1918, the Unit
ed States is engaged in the greatest
war in history. It is fighting in this
war for the same thing for which it
fought in every other war in which it
has. been engaged. Every war of ours
has been a war to liberate the laboring
man. The Revolution of 1776 was to
get the privileged class of England off
the backs of the American colonists,
who were redeeming this wilderness.
The War of 1812 was to rescue Ameri
can seamen from oppression. The
Mexican War was to liberate the set
tlers in Texas from the whimsey cru
elty of Mexico. The War of the Re
bellion, was to get the white man off
the back of the black man. The ac
cursed Institution of human slavery
had trailed its slimy length down the
centuries into the nineteenth. We
scotched it- The Spanish War was
undertaken because we could not en
dure the cries of Cuba being murdered
at our front doorstep. Having freed
that island, we did an unprecedented
thing in the history of nations. We
handed their country back to the Cu
bans, and withdrew our armies. So,
every time our army and navy have
gone forth it has been to clean up
some filthy autocracy, to end some an
cient fraud. We have no laboring
class in this country. Because we are
all laborers. The greatest labor union
in the world is the U. S. A. But all
our wars, as well as our intervals of
peace, have been but a preparation for
our present task. We did not realize
it No man forsees his destiny, no
nation forsees Its mission. Yet the
life of every nation as of every man
is a plan of God. God has been piling
up riches on this continent until we
are the wealthiest nation in the world.
He has been sharpening our inventive
skill, our craftmanship and our busi
ness ability. He has been forging here
a mighty spirit of democracy. It Is a
chip jibe to say that the United States
was unprepared. It has had the might
iest preparation In history. Now God
says, "America, you are come of age;
you are ready for your real work. I
have kept you in reserve until this
time. Go forth and make the world a
decent place to live in." When we
get fully into this war we will have an
army of five million of the finest men
in the world, a navy greater than that
of any other country, and a merchant
marine unparalleled. What for? To
liberate the common man evervwhere.
No such formidable flood of ' human
energy bag ever before been let loose
upon the earth. Not the armies of Al
exander, nor the legions of conquering
Rome, not the battalions of Napoleon,
not the murderous tribes led by Tam
erlane or Attilla, not the brutal hordes
of Prussian Junkerdom can compare i
with this mighty going forth of free
men from the New World. They are
the liberated sons of emigrants turn
ing back to bring liberty to the lands
of their fathers. We have ho desire
for territory. We have no ambition
for conquest and military glory. We
want no loot. All we want Is to make
free the common man everywhere. We
do not wish to conquer Germany: we
wish to aet the Germans free. ' It Is
for this reason that our preparation
has been slow. We are getting ready
to fight If all the rest of the world
quits. It is for this reason that the
armies of the United States have nev
er been defeated. It is for this reason
that we cannot come back "Till It's
over, over there." We must triumph
because we are but the crest of the
tidal wave of destiny. The future is
ours because our boys are dying In
Picardy for the same cause for which
Jesus died In Judea to save the
world.
Swimming contests are being held
nearly every day by the boys of the
"Y" and many good swimmers are be
ing produced.
Following is a letter from Mr. Rich
ardson, the first after his arrival in
Nashville, Tennessee: "Dear Mitchell
and all: The first breathing spell
since I have been in this burg, and
will try and give you some bit of in
formation at least the very meager
amount that I possess. I went out to
the plant the first morning of my ar
rival, and since then have been out
there each day from nine a. ni. to 6 or
7 in the evening, and I haven't begun
to see the beginning of the outfit. To
comprehensively describe the situation
conditions, etc., iR beyond expression,
but I may give you a slight Impression
Can you picture 2.J.000 min, mechan
ics, carpenters, workmen cf all de
scriptions, at work building houses,
warehouses, bungalows, hotels, bar
rack bunk houses, homes accomodat
ing 100 girls, apartment houses, stores,
etc. these including plumbers, elec
tric light installations, men by the
hundreds building foundations, digging
ditches, installing telephones, and so
on down the line if so, you have a
picture of the powder plant "village"
to be cf approximately 75,000 people.
One third of the burg is complete, and
judging by the past rf cord, it will take
six months to do the job. A most won
derful organization and progress is ev
erywhere evident, but still conditions
are decidedly chaotic in the extreme
Now, for the building take our lobby
and pool room space and just about
quadruple it. and you have the layout,
not counting a big reading room and
two educational rooms and a barber
shop and big storage room for buaet
etc. The gym which adjoins the lohhy
is at least three times the size of the
Bisbee Y, and will seat about 3,000
people. Has full stage, equipment, etc.
and six dressing rooms. Adjoining the
gym in the rear is the "ladies room"
about equal in size to our entire second
flcor, fitted up with kitchen, ladies toi
let, etc., with folding doors can all be
thrown into the gym. The manner In
which the gym floor isbelng laid is
quite suspicious of a first class dance
floor. The entire arrangement is ideal
for close supervision. When I say
that even with its enormous size, it
will be inadequate, you may doubt my
judgment, but judging from what I
havealready seen and observed. I be
lieve I am correct. Our special events
at Bisbee, such as Christmas, Stunt
nights, and Open House will be the us
ual patronage here. At present we are
using one end of a partially completed
mess hall and the thing is like a bee
hive constantly six to seven hundred
letter even now are being written
what will it be when accomodations
are inviting. Aside from the corres
pondence tables, an old organ adorns
the room and a long board in front
that serves for a counter. This is the
present Y. M. C. A. but the men are
ever grateful for this, and are patient
ly awaiting the new ones. As you
know, I have had some concern about
ray duty to go "overseas," but after a
few days here,. I am confident I can
manifest more patriotism and render
more genuine service right here in the
aiding in a real substantial fashion tiie
manufacture of munitions, than could
by accepting the "spectacular task"
of crossing the pond. "Help fill the
empty shell" Is the slogan here, a"d
the men seem to have the right spirit
to that end. Just now I am assembling
the furnirure and equipment for the
first bu'liiins, and I believe a couiC
of weeks will find us ready for a real
opening. How would 1500 members in
one day look to you that is the bee
that is buzzing In my bonnet just now.
At present, we have no members, but
30 days from now old Bisbee on the
hill will have to look out. I have made
no announcements, but I have set
3,000 as the minimum for the three
buildings. I forgot to mention our
colored men's building, which is about
two-thirds the size of the white build
ing, and is nearing completion. We
hope to dedicate this building in thirty
days. I was told by the chief engineer
yesterday that the second white build
ing an exact duplicate .of our first
one, will be started tomorrow. I am
not sufficiently familiar with all con
ditions to warrant a working policy
for our operation, but I am confident
the patronage will be enormous and
the opportunity for service unsurpass
ed anywhere. I am glad I am here to
have a share in the making for better
conditions for this great army of men.
I was about to overlook our lady

NEW YORK, July 13. Dearish in
fluences of au unexpected character
were injected into this week's dull and
chopping stock market. Developments
pointed to urgent need of financial as
sistance by manufacturers of war ma
terials and the proposed luxury tax
also were responsible for some unset
tlement. The terms involved in the
flotation of the Hetblehem Steel $50,
000,000 note issue directed attention
to the mounting co:,t of capital, apart
from the firmer tendencies evidenced
by thr general monetary condition.
Call money held at 6 per cent, large
ly as a result of the previous week's
enormous depletion o bank reserves,
and time rates ceased to possess ac
tual significance because of the mean
er available supply.
Trading in stocks scarcely justified
retailed comment. oue issue aion
utiuc I'O to So per cent to t:ie vcu
moderate dai.y dealings. There was
board room gossip respecting further
dividends on steel, rails were lgiioij
except for Heading and minor coalers,
together with an occasional inquiry ror
low priced western and southwestern
shares.
Differences -between the govern
nient and the railroads covering inter
nal .Guarantees promised early adjust
ment, but financial, institutians and
other important holders of railroad
shares were hopefifl of further noti
fication of the proposed slf udard form
of contract. ,
The most encouraging note of the
wick y;s, sounded by the federal re
serve board, which, reported highly
satisfactory business condition. Heavy
bank exchanges and the statement oi
mercantile agencies were confirma
tory of these conditions.
NEW STOCK RECORD
NEW YORK, July 13 The new rec

1 to 2 points, mainly upward.

It was a foregone conclusion that

Oats were bcarishly influenced by

Here Are the Fact
The labrir- carcass of a tire is built Mrcng. It has to be built h:r.yiig

B:it here is wha; lappens:
The rubber trend of the tire wears thin; and when it does, the
fabric canass is liaMe to blow up any time. It blows out because
it is no Ioi.ger protected from stone-bruises and the shocks of the
road; or it blows out because moisture reaches the fabric through
cuts and nail-hol'js, and rots it.
Today wiso motorists "OO.OOo of them, including many of the

fF THERE'S one thing the Ford
people know more about than any
thing else, it's building Fords. When
a Ford comes from the factory it comes
just as the folks there want it to be. They
could load their product with all sorts of
useless trimmings if they cared to be so
Foolish. 1
Or they could add a few good things,
but; they leave the choice of these to the
buyer!
There are probably more fool acces
sories made for Fords than for all other
cars put together. Then there are SOME
that are really worth while.
Go slow on accessories. We want to
see every Ford owner get the best possible
service from his car. We know which
accessories HELP, which are harmless,
and which HURT. Let us help you choose
the few good ones. ,
