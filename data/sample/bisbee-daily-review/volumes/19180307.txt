million dollars from the French government in dealings with American
motor track manufacturers. Frank J. Goldsoll. retired French soldier, is in
iail here tonight awaiting extradition proceedings which will begin March
20.
Goldsoll is accused by the French embassy of having appropriated to
his own use huge sums on war contracts which he was sent to the United
States to e::ecj:e for his government.
The prisoner declined to comment on the case but his counsel talked
freelv. asserting that his arrest was due to political antagonism. The
French ministry, they said, looked v.ith disfavor on Goldsoll's close aftilia
tions with Albert Thomas, former minister of Munitions and that Thomas
was the real objective of the prosecution.
Goldsoll. who is about 45 years old, was born of Russian-Jewish parvnl
age in Cleveland, Ohio, but went to France about Ji years ago and was
naturalised in 1911. When war was declared in 1S14 he enlisted and
served for a year as chauffeur for a staff officer before being retired lor
personal disability. He came to America in 1916 to place war orders lor
motor trucks. His counsel admits he made large profits on the deliveries

for consultations on military affairs.
To Send Delegates.
The Chinese government, it is said,
will also ask Japan to send military

(By Review Leased Wire)
WASHINGTON. March 6. It wf?
made plain today that lhe United
States has neither assented nor dis
sented to any plan of Japan for ac-
i tion in Siberia and that previous state
ments that no direct communications
have been exchanged between the two
governments on the subject were cor
red.
1h? American government has been
fully informed concerning the situa
tion by Great Britain, Japan's ally by
special treaty, and discussions be-

continuing. But so far as can be j
learned Japan has not even indirectly
asked the approval of her plans by
the United States, consequently the
lat'er is not called upon to make a
formal expression.
Great Britain is said to have er.
pressed confidence in Japan's inten
tions, with a view to allaying any ap
prehension here that Japan miht de

'uy Big Five Oil Stock ;
Today at 10 Cents
Well Number 3 came up four days ago with initial production ot
one thousand barrels a day. Here is your opportunity! Big Five
was organized only eleven months ago with forty acres lease south ot
Glenrock, Wyoming. Today is in the producing class and holds ap
proximately twenty thousand acres of splendid oil territory in eleven
proven fields, and six producing states. On the Rowe and Rainer
leases and the new Pine Island field of Louisiana, where so many
gushers have been brought in recently, our company holds a large in
terest. In the Rowe leases, which have just been organized into the
Western Oil Corporation, upon this property. three wells have been
completed with a daily production of 10K barrels. A contract was
.tiven for No. 1 in the Raines lease of this company, also for well No.
4 in the Rowe lease.
Associated with Big Five in this ownership and development of
these two leases are some Denver, Kansas City bankers, oil operators
and business men of large affa'irs. Last week Mr. Kearns, while in
Louisiana, secured two additional leases in the greatest oil field
of Caddo Parish, one opposite tbe Standard Oil company, also nego
tiating for 160 acres in proven oil field. In the Kentucky, Tennessee
shallow fields, our company holds approximately 12.000 acres under
contract by lease and option. I" pen several of the farms covered by
thfc.-e contracts wells have been completed with a great production.
In Wyoming, Big Five has five different leases amounting to thou
sands of acres and is drilling four wells at once in the Big Muddy
and Lost Soldier fields where so many gushers are pumping near us.
In Colorado, near Seibeef, where Big Five leases were among tlte
earliest located: in the Boyton field of Oklahoma, midway Okmulgee
and Muftkogee, the home of so many oil made millionaires, the first
well began already. We intend to go to a vigorous, aggressive drill
ing campaign during 191K, and add as rapidly as conditions and
cap1 Lai warrant, such other properties as our geologists reconimend.
Big Five ir not one lease, or one field, or even, one state proposi
tion. We are not risking all our stockholders' invested funds in a
small property, but we believe it is better .to mulUply our chances
for success by getting into as many proven districts as we possibly
can. In tills respect we are following the example of the greatest '
oil companies; just like Standard , Ohio. Texas and Sinclair Oil and
Refining company. Don't ait too long. PRICE WILL GO UP WITH

a little Pape's Diapep&in to help neu
tralize acidity and in five minutes you

I ring.
I The cause for court action arose i:i
1 April. 1916, rhcr. William Trunx ami
his son, as proprietors of the English
Kitchen at Bisbee. announced a i'htn
in the scale of wages and hours for tho
employes of the restaurant. The em
ployes numbered 10 me:.ibers of the
Cooks' and Waiters' union. Bisbee lo
cal No. 3ti0. Alter attempts to com
to an agreemen'. had fa '.ed. the em
ployes qt their work m the restau
rant and a strike was di?!ared to h-i
in existence.
During the course of the strike, the
union picketed the establishment
against which the strike was directed,
after about a wek of wliich action
William Truax -u.ught a petition of in
junction to restrain the union frora
continuing the picketing. This was
denied by the .ewer co:irt and the.
plaintiff then took the mutter to the
supreme court.
In setting forth the case, the opin
ion nnrl !itrps
Millions of men and women today j on or -Mr- Justice Cunningham says in
life nraamhla 1 A r rvo I lint nl llliam

Truax) commenced action to enjoin de
fendant (the onion) from advertising
the labor strike ind from cppealing to
union members and sympathizers by
means of banners, hand b'lls. circulars
and street talks, to cease dealing wi' t.
the plaintiff.-
The reason Tor commencing court
action by the owners of thi restaurant
is set forth in the opinion, "on th.
ground that plaintiffs are injured iz
their business and the detendatits are
insolvent and unable to respond in
damages and plaintiffs have no other
know that it is needless to have dys
pepsia. A little Diapepsin occasion
ally keeps the stomach sweetened and
they eat their favorite foods without
fear. 1
If youh stomach doesn't take care
of your liberal limit without rebellion;
if ycur food is a damage instead of
a help, remember the quickest, surest,
most harmless relief is Pape's Diapep
sin, hich costs only fifty cents for a

The little pain demons which cause
Rheumatism seem to lie dormant in
mild weather, Lut with the first re
turn of the raw, wintry blasts they
break out with renewed fury, and
start forth on their joyful tour cf
torture.
Then you remember how the idis
ecse first attacked you. The little
pains seemed very slight at first, for
Rheumatism is an insidious disease,
and creeps up on its victim unawares.
You hardly noticed the little twitch
ing" pains, for they barely attracted
Jour attention. But they began to be
come more frequent, and iust a little
Lit more painful and annoying each
cay.
And then, before you hardly real
ized it, you found yourself almost
bound hand and foot in the grasp of
one of the most .disabling diseases
that afflicts mankind, a full-fledcred
victim of rheumatism, with its acnes
tnd its pains for your constant com
panion.
And now the real important ques
tion with you is how to Fhake loose
from these millions of little paiQ de
mons that cause you bo much suffer
ing. Your experience has proven to
you that no real permanent benefit
can be expected from the use of lini
ments and lotions, for, try as you
will, you will never be able to rub
the pain away. No externally applied
remedy can stop such sharp shooting
pains, for they jnust be reacted at
their source.
Many forms of Rheumatism origi
nate in a disordered state of the
blood, and the logical taethod of
treatment is one that thoroughly
purifies the blood and cleanses it of
all foreign substances that have in
fected it Some very obstinate and
painful cases of Rheumatism have
yielded to S. S. S the great veget
able blood purifier, and no case
should be considered incurable, just
because it is rot reached by local
remedies applied to the surface.
Yon should give S. S. S. a thorough
trial, and if your Rheumatism comes
from a disordered state of the bloody
yon will be delighted with the results,
and soon find yourself on the way
back to health. Go to your drug sture
and get a bottle of S. S. S. today,
and begin at once on this splendid
treatment. If you wish any medical
advice, you can obtain same without
cost by writing to Medical Director,

A BOY AND AMERICANISM.
What the United States needs is more
citizen like the four-year-old son of Sheriff
A. Slaughter of Greenlee county. With
them this country would be an unpleasant
path for the German sympathizer, the Teu
ton spy. And, with them there would be
less criticism, less pessimism and more con
structive, active work' toward victory.
The story of this four-year-old is a master
piece of Americanism and patriotic spirit.
The sheriff's little son spends much of
his time about his father's office in Clif
ton. With his questions and his over-flow
of activity he frequently hinders the work
ers and at such times, one or another of sev
eral methods is used to rid the office of
his wriggling, bouncing, noisy personality.
The four-year-old had been more than
usually active one afternoon. His father
picked him up, opened the door to the jail
and placed him down on the inside.
"What are you locking me up for?" the
four-year-old inquired.
"You're a bootlegger," said the sheriff
father. The youngster turned his attention to
four men, prisoners with him. Three of
them he asked separately why they were in
iail. Each gave a joking, laughing answer.
Finally the four-year-old turned to the
fourth with the same question. The .man
was an alien enemy, detained for the gov
ernment. "I'm a German spy," he told the four-year-old.
The boy studied the man for a moment
before he replied. Then looking him
squarely in the eyes, he shouted.
"You damned scoundrel, you ought to
be hung."
The sheriff didn't reprove the four-year-old
for the language he had used. Instead
he convened court in his office, tried and
acquitted the boy, gave him the military
metal a big bag of candy.
THAT TOUCH OF SPRING.
Perhaps you have not felt it yet that
touch of spring. It is just a trifle too early
for the laziness of spring fever, for the
linger-longing to seek the hills and forests
and pearly brooks. The backbone of winter
is not sufficiently broken to bring to you
the call of the great outdoors.
But you must have noted that spring is
near. Boys have gotten out their marbles
and are flirting with tonsilitis as they crawl
about the still damp earth staking their
"taws" against another's '"twoeys." On
the back lot, and at the side of the hill-top
school house, recesses ring with the call of
the improvised baseball diamond where
games of "work-up" are in progress. After
school hours a kite is seen here and there
as it swings freely into the March breeze.
Hoops dragged from under the house or
out of the barn, ring as they bound over
the rocks. Your boy and the neighbor's
boy build a coaster and quarrel as to who
shall guide "her" down the steepest hill
in the district.
You cannot but have noted these signs
of spring. We all note them, casually, un
consciously, subconsciously, sometimes.
And noting them, we look back to the time
when we clambered aboard a rickety coast
er made painstakingly from the wheels of
a discarded baby carriage, and rattled
racingly down a hill when we risked our
best marbles against the other "feller's"
"dobies" when we clamored for "batter"
or "pitcher" or "catcher."
We are human most of us and that is
why we wish sometimes we could return to
thdse 'days. The years have been long
since we played at "knucks down" in the
gutter. We have plodded a hard trail,
working, striving, fighting aginst adds. We
have won success to acertain degree. We
have been repaid for our efforts since we
graduated from the Lite and marble age.
Greater matters have come into our lives
to take the place of what were then factors
of highest moment. We look back on child
hood joys with a fond memory which we
would fain have erased. But we cannot
help giving thanks that the men who are
to take our place will have some day
memories of vanished joys; that they are
enjoying now all those halcyon days which
for us can never come again.
RUSSIA AND JAPAN.
Two elements in the Russian empire will
welcome the intervention of Japan in Si
beria for the protection from Germany and
German agents of food supplies and war
stores at Vladivostok the peasant class,
who form eighty-five per cent of the popu
lation, and the Cossasks, the military of
the country. Both elements are opposed
to the capitulating, disgraceful peace pact
forced .on the bountry by Hun and Bolshe
viki. Each is waking to the fact that the
hollow teachings of Trotzky and Lenine
have brought on anarchistic autocracy in
stead of the democracy of which each had
dreamed. And they are tireing of subjuga
tion to the Teuton.
Russia will remain a potent factor in the
war, through these peoples. Russia will
never bow to the will of the kaiser and his
hirelings, because of these peoples. Rus
sia will regain its lost prestige, rebuild its
demoralized, discouraged, anarchized army
with new blood from the fields, renew its
fight on the side of democracy, and rise
from the conflict a new, free countryr But
time will be necessary for this reconstruc
tion. Leaders must be found. Men to
bring together the Don Cossacks, the
peasants, the artisans and the laborers for
a common cause, must arise.
Meantime, Russia not the Bolsheviki
Russia, but the great mass will look kind
ly and thankfully on any steps the allies
may take to protect them further from the
Hun. Russia, the great mass, will prevent
the turning of the country against England
and France and Italy and the United States ;
will oppose any alliance of arms with the
central powers;, will welcome protection
on the east as heartily as on the west, and
will remain steadfast in its determination
to emerge from the conflict freed of the
yoke of kaiserism.'
HUN IRONY.
There is subtle irony, if not indeed, grim
tragedy, in the German dictated terms of
peace to the Bolsheviki. Imagine the Hun,
stamped with the seal of autocracy, war
mad, ravisher of Belguim, permitting the
people a voice in their fate! Imagine the
kaiser, dictator of Russian degradation,
bowing to the will of subjected peasants!
And yet the third clause of the treaty
provides that the region west o f a line
agreed upon have no further obligation to
Russia, "and Germany and Austria will
determine their fate in agreement with their
population."
Is it easy to suppose that these people
will readily agree to the rough-lined yoke
of kaiserism? Will they welcome with
open arms the military serfdom offered by
the Prussian? What will be their voice in
determining their fate? Germany and
Austria will issue to the world their joint
statement that "in agreement with their
population," Germany and Austria have
divided the territory, the bulk of rich spoil
going to Germnay.
Hun irony, and grim tragedy for the
provinces affected! But in the irony and
tragedy is renewed again the lesson to the
world of Teuton brutality. It can but
serve to strengthen the allies' will to win
that they may free others through the
guarantee of their own freedom.
