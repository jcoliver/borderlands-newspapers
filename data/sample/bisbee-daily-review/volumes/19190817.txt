NEW YORK. Aug. 16. A strike
which union leaders declared ' would
completely tie up the vast subway

Manhattan, the Bronx and parts of
Brooklyn and Queens at 4 o'clock to
morrow morning, was called tonight
by P. J. Connolly, acting president ot
the Brotherhood, of Interborough
Rapid Transit company employes.
Corporation Counsel Burr and At
tornies of the Interborough tonight
were ' seeking a Bupreme court jus
tice who would sign an order enjoin
ing union officials from making the
strike order effective. But even, if
such an order were obtained, it wan
admitted, there was little hope of
blocking the walkout.
Frank Hedley, general manager or
the Interborough .said every effort
would be made to give service, but
added that the best possible servlcw
would be "very slim,'' as fully 95 per
cent of the company's employes are
members of the union.
This would leave about 700 men
loyal to the company, which number,
Mr. Hedley said, would not be aug

WILSON FIRMLY M IOTIC
AGAINST PLACE IN CARS, OHIO
TREATY CHANGE GOVERNOR SAYS
Senator Hitchcock Points Out
That Failure to Ratify Is
To Send Terms Back to Hun
Without Military Protection
WASHINGTON, Aug. 16. As a se
quel to the White House conference
yesterday between President Wilson
and Senator Hitchcock, administra
tion leader in the senate treaty fight,
it became apparent today that the ad
ministration forces would center their
present effort on bringing the treaty
out of the committee and defeating
any textual amendments, leaving in
the background any negotiations rela
tive to final ratification with reserva
tions.
Meantime, Republican senators de
clared one result of the negotiations
of the last few days and Senator
Hitchcock's statement after he left the
president had been to stiffen resist
ance to any attempt at unreserved
ratification and to increase the deter
mination of those who want the treaty
amended outright. They asserted yes
terdays' poll had shown opposition to
the Shantung provisions growing
stronger in the face of the explana
tory statements from Tokio, and from
the White House.
The reported, position of the presi
dent that any textual amendments
would send the treaty back for re-ne-gotiationv
with Germany without any
military force to compel acceptance of
the American demands was taken
as largely forecasting the trend of the
amendment fight. It was understood
that feature would be emphasized by
Senator Hitchcock in a speech he is
expected to make next week In the
senate. The fact that Senator Hithc-
cock did not quote the president as
standing uncompromisingly against
reservations for the same reason was
pointed out by some of tbe Republi
cans, who under the leadership of
Senator McNary, Republican, Oregon,
have agreed on a set of reservations.
They declared all the1 elements of the
situation bore out their claims of
Wednesday, that they had information
Insuring Democratic assent to their
program.
Among the group there was some
favorable comment during the day on
the new set of reservations shown to
Republican senators by Republican
Leader Lodge. In the same quarter it
was pointed out that should Lodge
definitely give his support to a reser
vation program acceptable to a large
number of senators, the logical out
come might be a draft of reservations
by him would become the rallying
point of the Republican reservation
forces.
Considerable Interest was aroused
by a statement of Mr. Hitchcock that
the president had laughingly suggest
ed sending Senators Lodge and Knox
to negotiate any future treaty with
Germany should the present one fail
through being amended. Republican
members of the foreign relations com
mittee who are fighting for amend
ments said they welcomed the sug
gestion as a "challenge."
The amendment proposal which the
leaders on both sides expect to de
velop the greatest strength In the sen
ate contemplates striking from the
treaty the provision giving Japan con
trol in the Chinees province of Shan
tung. ,'
Advocates of the Shantung -amendment
declare Senator Lodge will line
up with them on the proposal. They
also assert he will support several
other textual amendments In the com
mlttee'but the reservation group are
Inclined to think he will not.

Left Ten Days At a Time
COLUMBUS, Aug. 16. Informed
by state inspectors that carloads ot

days before unloading, often resulted
in waste, Governor Cox asked Rail
road Director Hines to fix a time lim
it of 24 hours "or other proper and
reasonable time within which such
cars must be unloaded,"
"The evil practice of making use
of railroad cars for storage purposes."
the governor said in a telegram to
Mr. Hines, "not only deprives traffic
of transportation means but also
holds back from the market the sup
ply to meet the demand which makes
for quick turnovers at moderate prof
its under reasonable and open com
petition."
According to Inspectors of the
state public utilities committee, num
erous carloads of potatoes, melons, to
matoes, peaches and other perishable
food were found in Cleveland, Cin
cinnati, Toledo, ' Dayton and other
large cities, which had stood on the

most instances the food was spoiled.
In some of the cities, it was held,
merchants were using the cars as
store houses, withdrawing1 what they
jieeded for the day and returning any
surplus at night.

LYNCHING
CARRANZA OUSTS BRITISH ENVOY
FROM MEXICO; TO TELL CONGRESS
HOW HE STANDS WITH THE U. S.
WASHINGTON," Aug. 16. More friction between Great Britain and
Mexico apepared today to complicate the Mexican situation. Britain's last
diplomatic representative in the Mexican capitol, William Cummings, in
chareg of the archives of the legation there, has been ordered from the
country by mandate of Carranza. The action amosnts to the British rep
resentative's practical deportation.
Great Britain never having recognized the Carranza regime, has had
no minister in Mexico City since Sir Lionel Carden, the charge d'af fairs.
Thomas Hohler was withdrawn some time ago, and Cummings was left in
charge of the legation records and acting as a medium of communication
for his government .although without official authority.
Now, wholly without representatives in Mexico City, England prob
ably will rely on France or the United States to represent her. At the
same time dispatches telling of Carranza's decision to inform the Mexican
congress at its opening September first, "Fully as to the state of the rela
tions with the governments of the U nited States and England," were re
ceived here and attracted considerable attention.
JAIL HOARDERS
AND PROFITEERS
SAYS CAMPBELL
U. S. Food Sale Only Surface
And Temporary Relief Says
Arizona Executive in Speech
Before Governors of West
SALT LAKE CITY, Aug. 16. "jail
the profiteer and seize his foodstuffs;
then worry about convicting him,"
suggested Governor Thomas E. Camp
bell, of Arizona, today, addressing the
conference of western governors
which is in session here, preparatory
to the opening of the national confer
ence of governors next Monday. This
was one step in a program to reduce
the cost of living suggested by the
governor. The other step was to "re
duce the cost , of wheat," which, the
governor contended, would cause the
"prices of other commodities to fall
of their own weight."
The governor said the sale of war
department surplus food supplies
would not lower living costs of the
people. He continued:
"Every state legislative Is cognizant
of the danger that will result from
the continued high cost of living. Un
less the cost of living is reduced ma
terially, the spirit of unrest that is
seething may get out of hand and en
gulf the country."
The governor went on:
"The federal government Is the
proper agency to reduce the cost of
living, and to punish the hoarders and
profiteers,, though action by states is
all right as far as it goes. But the
federal government has Jurisdiction
throughout the nation and its hand
can extend from Washington to grab
the profiteer and food hoarder.
"Sale to the people of the Jl 20,000,
000 surplus war department food sup
ply held by the government In storage
will not reduce the cost of living. The
packages sold usually are In such
quantities that the average family
cannot buy them and even when they
are sold in small quantities, there is
only about $1.25 worth of food per
capita.
"The people will get hungry tomor
row or the day after, and more food
will be needed. I should like to see
the profiteer and the hoarder Jailed
and his hoard Bold to the people. Then
worry about convicting him.
"The federal government Is the
only agency that can reduce the cost
of ilving in the United States." Gov
ernor Campbell declared. "Action by
the states In Jailing the profiteer and
seizing his foodstuffs have a power
ful effect locally, but this effect is
not far reaching enough, since the
state cannot go outside Its borders.
Many of the states are powerless to
act, other than through persuasion
and publicity, and these states look to
the federal government for action."

SWITZERLAND ALL CLUTTERED
UPilTDGilLESS ROYALTY
By HAROLD E. BECHTOL,
European Manager of N. E. A.
i ZURICH, Switzerland, Aug. 16.
Switzerland, the asylum of de
throned kings, subjectless "rulers and
blue-blooded refugees, has more royal
inmates than ever before.
Almost every week a new one
fcneaks across the border Into exile.
Many are living Incognito.
The .Swiss say more than half the
dozens of former German and Aus
trian kings are loafing about some
where. .
Some are standing on the roof3
crying, "Pity us!"
Some are dissipating In luxurious
places on money they never did any-1
thing toearn.'
The royal asylum Is taking on the'
aspect of a permanent Institution!

Constantine Ludwig, Karl and all

tryless. Nobody wants to be ruled
any more.
None of them is hard up or friend
less. The leavings of royalty seem
to have a way of taking care of their
own. Anyhow
Thse exiles live in the most de
lightful spots of delightful Switzer
land! They have more . and better food,
ia one mal, than the -average Amer
ican or Swiss has in two.
Friends and Families Keep Loneli-
ness Away.
They are not lonely most of them
have their entire families with them;
bthers have their friends along.
They are all surrounded by admir
ing hangers-on who sympathize, flat
ter and cheer them up.
They have at call anywhere from
six to sixtv servants apiece.
Those who don't live in mountain
eas'lrs. or lakefront bungalows hid
den away on grounds worth $30,000
an acre, live in beautiful suites of
luxurious tourist hotels.

Karl of Austria came fleeing into
Switzerland several months ago with
his wife Zita, three children and an
army of servants, escorted by Colonel
Strutt of the British army.
The Swiss government didn't know
whether to admit him or not, fearing
at first the opinion of the allied world.
But Swiss officials say Britain inter
vened, said his life was in danger and
got him In. .
Karl of Austria Has Two Retreats.
Part of the time he lives In state
at Wartegg Castle, part of the time in
a beautiful yellow mansion on the
shore of Lake Geneva, about 20 miles
from Geneva. He is there now, hunt
ing, fishing,' walking and climbing.
A few days ago I went out to his
mansion from Geneva. He wouldn't
be interviewed but his aides poured
out propaganda. He was such a good
democratic king, they said, it seemed
a pity nobody would lete him ml
them.
They complained that he was con
fined in hunting to this one estate.
They had been notified they said that
Paderewskl's chalet was adjoining
and that if he shot ' anything on the
pianist's grounds it might mean some
kind of a war between Poland and
Austria. And just because of his love
for Austria; he wouldn't get her in
any trouble even if he did have to
stay on his own grounds to shoot.
The amusing thing about it is that
somebody is kidding him. Paderew

estates separate it from Karl's exile

suite at the Hotel National at Lu

His attitude was that kings no long

why should not people be nice,.1 and
keep them, and provide funds and
thrones, and let them run their courts..
Asked about the king business now,,
he replied that divine right was an
"exploded idea."
"I never did believe in divine right,
and neither did any other house in
Europe except the German and Aus-J

Lieutenant Locklear stands today
as the premier stunt aviator in Amer
ica. In his stellar act which he has
agreed to put on here for the six days
of the fair, he stands far out on the
upper wing of one machine, speeding
through space at 100 miles an hour,
and then makes a leap for another
plane as It swoops across the course
above him.
To accomplish this daring feat af

Locklear has never failed. He has

"But ten feet separated the two ma

Standing upon the upper wing of the
lower airplane, Locklear waited his
opportunity to Jump from the rope

"Nearer and nearer the two ma

as though they would crash and hurl
the airman from his perch. Then as

the grandstand Locklear made his

JEROME, Aug. 16. Development
operations on the property of the
Lone Pine Verde Copper company will
be Inaugurated In the near future. The
decision to resume work on this prom
ising group was reached recntly at a
meeting of the stockholders of the
company.
Development work is to be started
on a large scale. Eastern capital, it
is said, has been interested with the
result that the company is inthe best
of condition financially. V. A. Jordan,
president of the company, has left for
an Eastern point to confer with the
backers of the enterprise.
Extreme optimism characterized the
stockholders' meeting. Every share
outstanding was represented at the
cession, which was postponed . from
August 8 at the request of California
stockholders, who wished to be pres
ent at the meeting. Reports which
were not given out for publication, are
said to describe the claims held by
. the company, in a glowing manner.
Work was stopped on the prospect,
shortly after the declaration of hostili
ties, for the duration of tho war in ac
cordance with the wartime policy of
conservation, though the showing
made by the preliminary development
almost entitled the Lone Pine to be
included in the producer class.
The holdings of the company adjoin
the properties of the Shea and Grand
Island. There is mau.ee activity in
this district. At the present time, the
Grand Island i3 prosecuting an ambi
tious diamond drilling program and
the Shea is shortly to be developed on
an unusually large scale. '
The Lone Pine Verde Is recognized
as one of the best groups in that high
ly promising district. At the time of
the cessation of activities, the main
shaft had been sunk to a crstance or
80 feet. Two tunnels had been cut
and rich ore values were found in
each. The upper tunnel is 150 feet
long, and the lower 278 feet. The last
assay run on samples taken from the
upper tunnel indicate tnat the ore will
average 158 per ton. -It has a high
copper and silver content and carried
large gold values. This assay would
run considerably Ligher at the present
time for when the analysis was hi ado
silver was selling; for. approximately
50 cents per ounce, or less than half
the present market value of the metal.
NEW CORNELIA
IN THIRD YEAR
IS A PRODUCER
I M NG 10. S. OAS GARS
NEWS OE GLOBE
MIAMI DISTRICT
The July production figures of New
Cornelia will probably attract more
than ordinary interest at this time by
reason of the fact that that month
started the third year of the com
pany as a shipper of copper.
New Cornelia, the youngest of the
porphyry properties, started opera
tions in May, 1917, while the first
shipment of electrolytic copper was
made on June 18, of that year. Dur
ing the two year period since the
company has produced 89,632,000
pounds of copper, 19,482,191 pounds
representing the output during the
part of the 1917 year that the plant
was in operation, 46,950,139 pounds
during the entire 1918 year, and 23,
200,000 pounds during the current
year to date.
This company has therefore been
shipping copper exactly 25 months, yet
In that short length of time It cleaned
up its floating debt, converted its
bonds into stock, and last November
paid on initial dividend of 25 cents a
share, indeed a remarkable record for
this newcomer among the porphyry
group. With a return to normal con
ditions in the copper metal market
New Cornelia is now expected to be
one of the leaders among the con
structive coppers.
New Cornelia for Beveral months
past has been operating at approxi
mately two-thirds capacity, July pro
duction amounting to 3,240,000 pounds,
against 3,440,000 pounds in June. It
would not be a difficult matter, how
ever, for the company to quickly in
crease its production to capacity with
short notice.
It is understood that New Cornelia
is laying its copper down in New York
at a cost of about 12 to 13 cents a
pound, exclusive of a charge for o:e
depletion. This low cost makes pos
sible substantial profits on the current
copper metal market, aue in-ro kjc
those who incline to the belief that
another dividend will be paid on the
shares before the close of the year.
A feature In favor of New Cornelia
is that it operates, with what is said
to be the lowest tonnage cost known
in Arizona, lhatiks to its steam shovel
system of operations. ;
The poc-ess of treating the ore by
leaching, which was adopted by New
Cornelia, produces practically pure
copper without the necessity of smelt
ing and refining. This is the only
company using this leaching process
in the couutry, aud the only one iu
the world, except Chile Copper.
Inspiration Consolidated Copper Co.
The Inspiration stilL. continues to
run at reduced capacity and will prob
ably not mine and mill the amount
of ore they are capable of until the
copper and labor, situation are in bet
ter condition.
The - Inspiration still continues to
make a great many surface Improve
ments, among which are the erection
of the new administration building
and the construction and improvement
of various roads over the property.
The administration building is a re
inforced concrete structure with a
Spanish tile roof. ' It consists' of two
stories and basement and will be
equipped modernly la every respect.
Ice water will be piped throughout the
building and a vacuum cleaning sys
tem will be part of the equipment.
Modern vaults for the protection of
the records will be installed. This
building will be used for the accom
modation of , the administration and
accounting departments.
Thousands of dollars are being ex
pended on the construction of new
roads and the repair of those In exist
ancc. It is the intention of the man
agement to cut cut all short curves on
the roads and- to Install efficient drain
age. The drainage will be done by a
system of ditching and the use of
Arco pipe culverts. Property drainage
is one of the most important points in
the keeping of roads in a satisfactory
condition.
Old Landmark Being Dismantled.
The old 'Brown Palace" is finally
being dismantled. This building, which
has been a prominent land mark at
Webster Gulch for a great many years,
was erected several years ago by the
late Col. Fleming to Berve as a leach
ing plant for the ores of the present
Warrior mine. As often happens in
pioneer enterprises, the leaching plant
was a failure and this old building has
long stood as a monument to the first
efforts of leaching in this district. It
is a coincidence that this old plant is
only a few hundred feet from the
leaching plant that is now being oper
ated by the Inspiration Consolidated
Copper company, where everything
points to a successful solution of the
leaching of copper ores in this district
. - - ... , .- . .. V
Miami Copper Company.
The underground pockets at Shaft
No. 5 will soon be finished, which will
mark the practial ompletion of the
underground work entailed in the
sinking of this shaft Excavation and
grading for the new hoist and head
frame at this shaft is progressing very
rapidly and it will only be a short time
before -the installation of the ma
chinery will be started.
The mill still continues to run at
two-thirds capacity and no information
is available as to when the remaining
sections of the mill will be put in
operation; probably not until the cop
per and 'labor situation clears up.

iSSERTS HIKES
WASHINGTON, Aug. 15. Replying
to a. senate resolution, Director Gen
erai of Railroads Hines informed the
senate today that while there had
been some car shortage in the bitum
inous coal districts, he did not "antici
pate any shortages in transportation
which will be in ' any sense excep
tional orabnormal or which justify
oppressive prices for coal."
"The great danger that confronts
thei public," the director general as
serted, "is that any shortage either in
production by the mines or . in trans
poAation may be exaggerated so as to
serve as. a pretext for heavy increases
in the coal prices, which in my. opin
ion; arc already high, generally speak
ing." Mr. Hines called attention to the re
port of the Geological survey showing
that up to July 12 the loss on account
of car shortage was a very minor one
and relatively much less than that
from "mine causes" and "no market."
"L. do not believe," lie continued,
"that further action by congress will
aid in meeting the demands for the
transportation of the coal which will
be ' needed during the remainder of
Ihe calendar year."
Mr. Hines said, however, that the
coal demand amounted to 500,000,000
tons, as predicted by the -National
Coal association, "there promises to
be not only substantial difficulties in
the transportation of coal but also in
the production by the mines of the
coal which can be transported." Re-'
Raiding the car supply, Mr. Hines said
there were 1,067,000 open top cars in
the United States.
'He estimated that about 775,000
cars were suitable for coal loading.

Shaft Number 1 of the Van lyke
Copper company Is now 304 feet deep.
Work on the installation of a water
ring and the construction of a sump
for the catching of the surface water
of the upper portions of the shaft has
been completed, a pump will be in

This will materially facilitate the sink

necessary to handle the water by balling.
It is expected that the installation
of the water ring and sump will solve
the water problem until after the ore
body has been reached.
The Old Dominion is preparing to
open up a quarry for flux near the
site of the Gray shaft. This is a body

The experience of Dawson, New
Mexico, in replacing the saloons with
the same, minus the alcoholic drinks
speaks well for the success of the 'Sal
vation Army plan of turning all corner
saloons into clubs. When the prohi
bition law went into, effect in New
Mexico, it was decided at Dawson, the
coal and coke mining camp of the
Phelps Dodge Corporation, to retain
the saloons, that is, the fixtures, the
brass rail and the bar keeper, and
turn them into clubs' or soft drink par
lors, performing all of the functions of
the saloon, except the selling of hard
drinks. ", "
When shorn of the large profits that
go with the alcoholic drinks, the
saloon could not be expected to be as
as profitable, but they have been more
than self-sustaining, j" The recent an
nouncement by Commander Booth that
the Salvation Array is to acquire the
leases of the corner saloons in New
York City, to be5 operated along the
enmo nlan na that -which has DrOVen .
successful in Dawson, bears out the f
observation that men go to tho saloon t
for companionship rather than for
drink. ' ; 'y " '
Commander Booth, jn a recent in-j
terview, saia:
"The Salvation Army has within the
last few weeks demonstrated the psy
chology of the brkss rail. There is
something about the shining bar that
brings men to a cdtnmon footing. The
easy and relaxed, attitude of those
who lean against the mahogany or
cherry suggests cpmfort."
The experience . at Dawson shows
more than that; it retains Its value as
a "poor man's lub" ra plaee where a
man can go in an atmosphere where
he feels entirely" at. home, not a club
with a marble foyer where he feels
that he must have' a white collar and
patent leather shoes. The saloon con
verted to the soft drink parlor an re
tain the companionship and sociability
that is denied by -the soda fountain. I
Experience at Dawson has shown the
possibilities of the plan, which It Is I
believed, will extend all over jthc
country. (

DOUGLAS, Aug. 16. Good reports
continue to reach Douglas concerning
the mining activity in that part of
Sonora tributary to this city. At the
San Nocholas mine in the CumpaS dis
trict the reconstructed concentrating
mill, including the straight flotation
process, is now In operation and is
making regular output -'of about two
tons of concentrates per day. This
property is being worked on a lease
held by Douglas citizens, including
Marion Williams, who is president, F.
H. Fisher, treasurer, and Carl Knud
son, manager in charge of 'the work.
Mr. . Cloud, who is a director in the
company, expects to leave for the
mine tomorrow. He returned from a
visit at his ord home in Kentucky re
cently and would have seen ns the
mine now except for the railroad
washout on the Nacozarl railroad.
About forty tons of ore is being
milled now each day and it is planned
for doubling this operation during the
fall season. From the forty tons of
ore milled daily two tons of concen
trates are received which gives eight
hundred ounces, of silver, 1600 pounds
of lead and about 120 pounds of cop
per. The concentrates are hauled by
wagon to Nacozari where they are
shipped., to. the El Paso-smelter for
filial ' treatment. The name of the
leasing company is the Desarrolladora
and a force of 50 men is employed.
The North Tigre.
Frank Holges, who is In charge or
the work at the North Tigre, is in the
city. A concentrator is being erected ;
on this property and good headway is I
being made with it. This property
has been under development for sev
eral years and large bodies of ore are j
avanaoie ior running iue mm wuen n.
is completed. "Dick" Brown, who
was the original promoter of the com

the property for years. It was taken j
over by the state government of Sono-j
ra some six years ago and It Is said!
that negotiations are underway or its j
return to Mrs. Garcia. "
MThe .Colonel' was -killed in; the City
of Mexico two or three years ago. It :
is said that under the operation of the I
government considerably valuable ore
was taken out, but that in doing so all
the waste was left in the mine and
that its condition now is such that, it i
would have to be reopened, but its
known value would fully justify this
whenever its title is- put in undoubted
condition. - '
The Roy Mine.
Captain Barnett, who has been
building a fifty-ton concentrator at the
Roy mine, now owned by Col. B. A.
Packard, of this city, has been in the
city for several days, expecting to re
turn to the property today. The Roy
adjoins the Cinco de Mayo and devel
opment work fully justified the erec
tion of the mill. The mill Is now prac
tically completed; a test run was made
that a slight alteration would be made
in some part of the machinery and
Captain Barnett came here Tor some
needed parts. The ore milled in the

WEEKLY FINANCIAL REVIEW
tv:f:v YORK. Aug. 16. Labor condi
tions and other indications of social
unrest, notably the nation-wide price
agitation, accouuieu mainiy ior me
further break in toci market prices
this week.
The decline was not unwelcome in
conservative circles, however, 6ince
it v.ad th effect of eorrectine- to a
. V. U
considerable extent fictitious or un
stable Dosition of many of the more
speculative issues.
Another ractor wnicn aouDtiess
would have given a check to buinsh
nnoratinns on any thine like the re
cent scale was complete collapse of
foreign exchange. French and Italian
rates fell to unprecedented discounts,
with fresh weakness in sterling remit-
tiinrps.
Rtpna were taken during the week
to ameliorate exchange conditions by
the organization or a creait corpora
tion whose, chief function will be the
placing of funds to meet foreign obli
gations in this morket. It is gener
ally rwoenized. however, that read
justment of exchange is well night im
possible without substantial aid from
the foreign governments most con
sidered.
The money market was unusually
easy as to call loans, the supply most
of the time exceeding the demand,, but
this condition resulted more from re
duced stock dealings that from any
more important reason. Bankers re
alize that the money market will be
put to its severest test in the impend
ing domestic and foreign demands.
Annrt from the unsettlement created
by labor disturbances, the industrial
situation was rather mixed. Better
conditions prevailed as to iron and
steel in , which greater productions
were reported while the leather and
textile industries weer measurably af
fected by, the high cost movement.
THE GRAIN MARKETS
CHICAGO, Aug. 16. Sharp breaks,
which took place m the corn market
tiday were largely owin,? to the fact
that sterling exchange had dropped to
$4.25, a new low record. Corn closed
heavy at 1 to 340 net decline, with
September $1.82 and December $1.43
to $1.44. Oats lost 1 to lc and
provisions, 1 to 7 cents. Weakness in
the corn market was evident from the
outset. Most of the earlier selling,
however, appeared to be based on an
ticipation that railroad traffic, which
has been disrupted by the shopmen's
strike, would be back to normal Mon
day. Bears assumed that, therefore,

the volume of corn receipts here and
ot other important terminals would
probably increase.
Week-end covering by shorts rallied
the market, but at this juncture the
attention of traders began to center
on the extreme weakness of foreign
exchange. Throughout the rest of the
day corn prices kept on he down
grade and finished at asout tDe lowest
point reached.
Oats weakened with corn. It was
reported that the greater part of new
crop offerings were unusually light in
weight.
Provisions gave way to rue depres
sion of hogs and grain. Upturns as
sociated with the bullish showing of
the semi-monthly figures on ware

Two barrels of mash and a quantity

Porlrins W. J. Johnson and Mrs. Can
Anderson on charges of illegally
manufacturing liquor. Johnson ana
Mrs. Anderson are Baid to have rent

trio will probably be turned over to
the federal authorities.
The raid ws made by Sheriff Mc

Tom Foster of Lowell, Chief of Police
Kenipton and Constable A. E. Shep
herd. Sheriff McDonald stated that, his
suspicions had been aroused by a
laree ouantitv of uncorked bottles ly

tle "inside" information that he had
received regarding the nature of ope
rations in the. Perkins shack.'
The party swooped down on the
building late yesterday afternoon.
They found it unoccupied but contain
ing two barrels of mash, and wet corn
spread out between dampened sacks
on th3 floor. No still apparatus was
discovered.
The officers then visited a room

where thev Dlaced the landlady, the
Anderson woman and Johnson, under
arrest and took them to the city jail.

they were no longer living there.

about 60 years of age, at fir6t sup

BATTLE OF WM
ST LUST BROUGHT
IS THE BITTEREST IF ALL WM
Every Inch of Ground Was Stubbornly Contested by H u n s,
Who Knew That If Americans Succeeded War Was Lost,
First Hand Narrative of Great Six Week's Offensive Re
veals; Positions Were Taken and Retaken Many Times
-BY W.R.WEBB
First Sergeant, Army Service Corps, A. E. F.
One of the most terrific struggles
of the whole war occurred in the
region between the Argonne For
est and the Meuse River during the
last few weeks of the conflict. This
gigantic battle raged ptacticaUy
without interruption from July 18th
to Nov. 11th. 1918. The story of this
battle was told from day to day in
part by the newspapers, but now for
the first time it Is possible to present
a unified and connected nrcative of
it frem official sources. The follow
ing story shows the Americans smash
ing through line after line of the
enemy's defenses and driving Ger
many's proudest troops into positions
of such peril that the petition for" an J
armistice was the only logical solu
tion.
First Phase Sept. 26th to Oct 4th.
At 5:30 o'clock on the morning of
the 26th of Sept. 1918. began the
greatest battle in the history of
American arms. Hundreds of our
guns, pouring shell into the enemy's
positions, had made of the night be
fore a rocking, ear shattering, flam
ing hell. They tore and smashed the
German lines of defense to such an
extent that, when our troops went
over the top, they advanced to an
average depth of seven miles.
Oaihe left the heights of Vauquois
and Varennes fell almost without, a
fight. Le Four de Paris is in this sec
tion and is the heart of the Argonne
Forest in which there were many bit
ter struggles between the French and
Germans in 1915 and 1916. The for
est here is heavily wooded, is cut
through by many steep ravines so
that an offensive on a large scale was
then Impossible. The Germans bet
lieved the forests impregnable and on
the reverse slopes of the many hills
we found elaborate dugouts, rest
houses, etc. In this ' section the
trenches were protected by masses of
barbed wire strung from tree to tree
and hidden in the thick underbrush.
When we g6tto the top of the ridge
of the Four de Paris we found two
lare mine craters over 150 feet deep
and 250 feet across where the Ger
mans had attempted to stop the ad
vance. The road from Le Four de Paris to
Vauouois passes along a ridge from
which we had an excellent view ot
the rear of the German first line
positions. A short distance from the
road on the crest of the ridge there
are several very elaborate German
dugouts, one particularly well fortl
fied and equipped, which was occu
pied by the 77th division as its head
ouarters during the greater part o!
the fiehtlng in the Argonne. It was
through this difficult terrain that the
77th division advanced to north of La
Harazce. The 91st. overcoming light
machine gun and heavy artillery re
sistance, reached the Very-Montfacon
ridge by nightfall; some of its patrols
fought their way into Epionville. The
37th and 79th passed through the
woods in front of them and, by even
ing the latter held the slopes leading
to Montfaucon. This mountain itself
was assailed at dark by the 313th In
fantry, with the aid. of tanks, but a
deluge of fire and lack .of artjllery
support caused the postponement of
the attack, after heavy casualties.
Smoke Barrage Wins Hill.
Vauquois, taken by the 35th divi
sion, is a little town on an isolated
hill by the same name and, with hill
263 on the west, served as the outpost
defenses of the Aire vally. It was
impossible to take the hill by a fron
tal assault so a smoke barrage was
placed on the hill and the 35th divi
sion simply went around it and cap
tured it from the rear. Hill 263 was
captured by the 28th division. Vau
quois was the scene of very severe
fighting between French and Ger
mans in the early days of the war.
In-1915. when subterranean mines
were employed at various points
alone the front lines, both French
and Germans set off mines on hill
263 so that it is entirely cut in two
by an artificial raviie. Tunnels
were run through the hill to the lips
of these mine craters, listening posts
were established at the heads of the
tunnels so that the . opposing lines
wore in many places not more than
K0 vards apart. When we reached
the vlllaee of Vauquois we found that
every stone had been pulverized to
dust by the many months of artillery
fire.
Varrenes was the next village we
entered, being on the top of a hign

Vauquois. This town is noted in his
tory as being, the place where Louis
16th and Marie Antoinette were
captured in their flight from Paris
and taken back to Paris to the guillo
tine. 33rd Performs Wonderful Feat.
The crosisng of the Forges stream
by the 33rd division was a wonderful
feat. Duckboards were thrown over
the enemy wire entanglements in
some places and elsewhere the men
waded through swampy ground undei
deadly fire. By noon this division
had reached Its objective along the
Meuse.
The 37th division entered Ivolry
and took hill 258, southwest of the
town, but was later withdrawn. The
right flank of the 37th division and
the left regiment of the 79th attacked
Montfaucon on the next day, Sept
27th, despite furious resistance, the
313 infantry got into the town, follow
ed by troops of the 37th division who
mopped up the position. Montfaucon
was the principal observation post of
the Meuse-Argonne front and has an
altitude of 1,000 feet. From its crest
an excellent view can be obtained of
the battlefiled. the wooded heights ot
the Argonne on the west, the hills be
yond the Meuse on the east and on
the last day we were there we could
see Verdun, about 20 miles away.
One of the interesting sights here
was the concrete observation post
built in a chateau, extending from the
cellar up through two stories to the
roof, equipped with stairway and
elevator. From this chateau was a
funnel running fcack to the bottom of
the hill and it is said that twice dur
ing the war the Cwwn Prince came
to this especially built observation
post and from its recesses directed
the battle of Verdun in person. The
German newspapers commented on
the bravery of the Crown Prince in
his presence on the front lines and
this box with a 4x10 inch opening was
the nearest the front line he ever got
On the right the 33rd division held
its ground along the Meuse according
to orders. The 4th division pushed
forward to the northern edge of the
Bois de Brielulles, where they met
strong opposition as also in the Bois
de Faye. The 80th division reached
its objective, except on the left,
where it was held up by the 4th divi
sion's unsuccessful advance. ;
91st Was Busy Division.
On the extreme left troops of the
77th division had reached their ob
jective while, -further east, the 91st,
37th and 79th were pushing forward
despite stubborn resistance. The
91st made a particularly successful
advance, going ahead of both the di
viisons on its flanks, but, because
these could not keep up, it was forced
to abandon ground won at great cost.
The 91st soon ran Into increasingly
murderous fire, but on Sept. 29th,
after having cleared the" Bois de
Baulny and the. Bois de Epinettes, it
renewed its attack. Though held up
at Xierges, It cleared the wds of
that name and!- on the left, reached
the woods of the Tronsol farm. An
other attack, ordered in the after
noon, was successful along the front
of the 91st and resulted in the cap
ture cf Gesnes. On the left the line
went beyond the Bois de la Morine
and the Bois de Chene Sec.
In this Bectlon of the Argonne
Forest near Gesnes is a little village
by the name of Romagne, which has
been donated by the French govern
ment to the American government to
be used as one of the three national
cemeteries' for the American dead.
When I was there last April I found
that every effort was being made for
the proper re-burial of those who lost
their lives in the Argonne battle and
at that time some 24.000 of the
American dead were buried there,
making it' the largest American war
cemetery in foreign lands.
At 4 o'clock this afternoon the
commander of the 91st learned that
the leading elements of the 35th, on
his left, had fallen back from Exer
mont, while on the right the Bois de
Emont had been evacuated by the
leading units of the 37th division.
TVis left the flanks of the' 91st in a
perilous position and placed the di
vision in danger of being cut off by
the enemy. The 91st sent . word to
the 37th to move forward far enough
to cover the right flank, but received
a reply that such a move was impos
sible. The 35th, on the left of the
91st, was also in a tight place and
was retiring to Baulny, having sent
out appeals for help on both flanks.
M TO i
There was no other course, therefore,
for the 91st except to fall back.
The 79th finally succeeded in
reaching the Bois de Beuge and Nan
tillois, but several attacks on the
Bois de Ogons failed.
On the extreme right the 4th and
80th divisions tried to extend their
gains, but failed under heavy fire
from the east bank of the Meuse
river. On Sept. 30th the 37th division
was relieved, by the 32nd and the 79th
by the 3rd. The 91st held desperate
ly to its line until Oct. 4th, when it
was relieved by the 32nd, Vhipti four
days previously had taken over the
37th's sector. The Germans continu
ed to reinforce their front, rushing
up new divisions from the Metz
area.
The net results of the first phase
of the great battle were these: On
the first and second days our troops
broke through the first two lines of
the enemy's defenses and penetrated
the third line the Volker Stellung
at one point. From then until Oct.
4th, there was bitter close quarter
fighting along the entire front. The
hardest fighting was on the right of
the First corps, as the enemy was
using every effort to hold the salient
which the Americans had driven into
the German lines in the Argonne
Forest.
Second Phase Oct. 4th to Nov. 1st
Along most of the front the Ger
mans were now in ' their positions
known as the Kriemhilde Stellung,
along the heights north of Beffu,
Landres-et-St. Georges and Banthe
ville. The general American attack was
resumed on Oct. 4th. It met with
the strongest resistance, but our
troops succeeded in capturing the
Bois des Ogons, Exermont, Chenery,
and La Forge. Twice on Oct. 5th
troops of the 30th division attacked
the Bois des Ogons with the resis
tance of tanks, and finally reached its
northern edge.
On Oct. 6th a new. movement de
veloped which had not been included
in the original plans. The German
position in the Argonne forest was
seriously threatened, but in order to
force the Germans there to retire it
was necessary to capture the heights
on the eastern edge of the forest. A
brigade oi the 82nd division, with the
55th brigade of the 28th division,
supported by one regiment of the
56th brigade., made the attack from
Chatel Chehery. The 82nd division,
which was to extend the front of the.
attack as far north as Fleville, was;
unable to get its left regiment, the
327th, up m time, so that mere was
a gap in the line.
The 55th brigade soon took Chatel
Chehery. but was held on the slopes
of Hill 244. On the right. Hill 223 had
not been taken, as the 327 infantry
of the 82nd division did not get up
till noon, and the right of the 55th
brigade was suffering severely from
machine gun fire. A battalion there-'
fore, was sent forward to take Hill
223. Hill 244 was captured only after
terrific fighting. The 82nd on the
right took Cornay and Hill 180.
Bold Operation Outflanks Hun.
Outflanked by this bold operation,
the German soon found his salient in
the Argonne untenable and hastily re
treated with the result that the
enemy was forced out of the Ar
gonne forest. By Oct. 10th the 77th
division had advanced to Chevieres,
clearing the forest. The 82nd divis
ion now took over the sector of the
28th. "
This sudden attack to the west
was made possible by the brilliant
work of the 1st division, which forced
its way northward to the Kriemhilde
Stellung and thus was able to protect;
the right flank of the attack against
the Argonne ridges.
On Oct. 2nd the first battalion of
the 308th infantry, with a company
of the 307th and part of the 306th
machine gun company, about seven
companies in all. was cut off is the
heart of the forest. The 77th divis
ion in its advance had left its left
flank in the air. This detachment,
held out for five davs under galling
fire from all sides. They were finally
rescued on Oct. 7th, having lots about
half their number in killed and
wounded. Their story has spread all
over the country and they are known
as the "Lost Battalion."
Our center was still a bit south of
the Kriemhilde Stellung line. It was
planned to break through this line
on the hills on the left of the Bois de
Valoup and get through to the
Tranche de la Mamelle, thus encir
cling' the village of Romange. This
attack, if succegful. would piece the
Kriemhilde line at its strongest point.
With the aid of the 42nd division,
which had come in on the left of the
32nd, these troops advanced under
heavy barrage on the morning ot
Oct. 9th. On the left the 32nd had
great success, penetrating the lines
of the enemy at one point on the
Cote-Dame-Marie. The right of the
division got into hand-to-hand fight
ing in the Mamell trench and stopped.
Turther to the right the 80th divis
ion reached the Cunal-Brieulles road.
Two companies filtered into Cunal
itself, surprising and capturing the
Germans there.
80th Faces Heavy Fire.
On Oct. 10th. the 80th planned to
continue the attack, but was broken
up by the enemy's fire. It was then
relieved by the 5th division, 'rne 4in

they were recalled! at dark. On Oct.
12th the 4th division succeeded ' in
getting through the Bois de Foret
and pushed out patrols to Hill 299.
With the clearing of the Argonne
Forest a new objective was set for
the 1st corps a line through Sivry-lez-Buzancy,
to flank the ( Bois de
Bourgogne. Elements of the 82nd di
vision crossed the Aire river on im
provised bridges, and the 77th was
able to get patrols across after pass
ing through the Bois de Negromont.
The French ,on our left, during these
two days had advanced about 8 miles
west of the Aisne river.
In the center our troops were still
held by the Kriemhilde Stellung line,
so on Oct. 12th one brigade of the 5th
division relieved the 80th south of
Cunal, the 5th along the Cunal-Brieulles
road, and the 4th north of the
road in the Bois de Foret. Only two
battalions of the 5th had been put
Into the line when, at 4 p. m. the di
vision was relieved by the 3rd. The
3rd was relieved a few days later by
the 4th. -The 33rd, which had beei!
stationary sincfe Oct. 4th, was assign
ed to the H 7th . French corps in the
line east of the Meuse.
Through' Kriemhilde tellung.
On Oct. 14th the advance was re
sumed all along the line. The Ger
mans" putdown aj heavy counter bar
rage, inflicting- serious - losses. The
advance continued up the slopes .of
Hills 260 271. .The . infantry was
halted after advancing about a mils.
The 32nd division had been held up
in front of Cote-Dame-Marie, but its
right finally took Romagne. The 42nd
got over Hill 288 at noon. Later in
the day the right of the 5th division
captured the Bois Pu'.tiere. The
Kriemhilde Stelliung line, as a result
of these gains, had been pierced at its
strongest point.
In spite of the fact that the 5th
division was greatly depleted as a re
sult of this 'heavy fighting, a new at
tack was started on the morning of
Oct. 15th. They tried to get into the
Bois de Rappes, but did not succeed
that day. Two days later the 32nd
tried to rdeach Bantheville and the
5th made another attempt to take the
Bois de Rappes. -Every effort to ad
vance was checked by the Germans,
although the 32nd was able to get
through the Eois de Bantheville,
where it was relieved by the 89th.
Part of the 5th diviison was ordered
to attack again Oct. 20th.
The objective now was .to make a
salient approximately five miles deep,
the 5th corps to form the point. The
attack was launched on the morning
of Nov. 1st. In the center the troops
made a deep dent into .the Freya
Stellung. capturing St. Georges, Landres-et-St.
Georges, Imecourt, Lan
dreville, Cennery, Bayonville, Re
monville, Clery-le-Grand and Ande
vanne. For the attack, the 5th division on
the right, was to act as a pivot until
the 90th on its left, reached the
Meuse. In case of a general with
drawal the 5th was to cross the
Meuse river and advance up the
heights pn the other side. -
Bigger Gains. Second Day.
The remarkable fact about the sec
ond day's operations was that greater
gains were made than on the first
day, something which had not hap
pened before in an attack on the
Western front. The 80th division
drove the enemy from Buzancy, the
German railhead in this region, and
the headquarters of General Von der
Marwitz, the commander of the Ger
man 5th army. He occupied a large
chateau at the edge of the town and
behind the chateau is an elaborate
dugout, which was built especially fVr
him. It had panelled walls and ceil
ings and was electric lighted through
out. One of the peculiar incidents
which were found in many places was
the partial destruction of this cha
teau by American artillery and one
shell tore out practically the entire
ceiling in one room leaving a small
part of the flooring on which stood
an old fashioned grand piano, three
legs resting on the floor and the
fourth leg resting on pure air and
just balanced so nicely that a child
could topple it over into the floor be
low. The attack of the 89th north of
Bantheville on Uov. 1st began well,
but on the following days was con
siderably slowed up. Barricourt was
captured Nov. rd. The 1st division
was ordered to pass through the
89th, bnt the commander of the latter
asked permission to keep his troops
in line. From north of Tailly large
convoys of Germans succeeded in
holding off our main forces until their
troops had crossed the river.
Beaufort was captured Not. 4th
and on Nov. 5th units of the 89th di
vision succeeded in crossing the
Meuse ever partially destroyed
bridges.
Remarkable Feat by 2nd.
The 2nd division, on the left of the
89th, accomplished one of the most
remarkable feats of the war. On the
night of Nov. 3. after the marine
brigade had broken through the
enemy's positions, the 9th and 23rd
infantry regiments were formed In
column on the road leading north to
Beaumont. The 9th infantry led the
column with the usual advance guard
and flank patrols. Beyond this pro
tection there was nothing to prevent
the entire brigade from being cut off.
It marched all night long straight
through the enemy lines for a dis
tance of about eight kilometers,
through the Bois de Belval, the Bois
du Four, and the Eois du Fort Ger
ache. The enemy was taken com
pletely by surprise. A few machine
guns opened up on the column, but
they were soon silencedl by details
sent out for this purpose. Other ma
chine gunners were found asleep at
their, guns and captured. Many de
tails of enmy troops were captured,
and at La Tuilerie Farm the advance
guard found the place occupied by
German officers sitting around tables
with lights burning. They were
thrown into dismay by the appear
ance of American troops, whom they
thought far to the south.
This rapid advance succeeded so
well that the troops on both flanks,
which had been held up, were able to
move forward. The line was com
pletely broken through and the
; enemy soon vas everywhere in
rapid retreat.
On the left the enemy's resistance
gave way before the repeated attacks
of the 78th and 77th divisions, and he
began to fall back so rapidly that his
retreat bordered on a rout. Our
troops in this sector, in order to keep
up with the enemy, were loaded on
motor trucks. The enemy was com
pelled to abandon completely the
Bois de Bourgogne. Out-flanked by
the French on the west, the Germans
withdrew hastily. French and Amer
ican troops joined hands at.'Chatil-
lon-sur-Bar, and thus the last impor
tant bulwark which guarded the great
German "Voie de rocade" was cleared.
On the right our men pushed
rapidly down the left bank of the
Meuse, harassing the enemy's retreat
at every step.
On Nov. 4 troops of the 80th divis
ion had reached the heights south of
Beaumont, where they encountered
the first organized opposition. The
towns and roads behind the enemy's
lines were crowded with retreating
troops and transports. The enemy's
confusion was great and there were
all indications that he was throwing
in his last reserves.
Crossing of the Meuse.
The 5th division learned on Nov.
2, that the enemy was withdrawing.
Preparations were at once made for
crossing the Meuse. This proved to
be a most difficult task. After work
ing around the edge of the horseshoe
bluff north of Brieulles and taking
Doulcon, an attempt was made to
cross on the night of Nov. 3-4. In
the face of a heavy fire two com
panies got across at Brieulles, but
the others could not follow. These
two companies dug in.
On Nov. 4 another attempt to cross
at Clery-le-Petit failed. Meanwhile
the two companies of the 60th in
fantry already crossed at Brieulles
succeeded, by a surprise attack, in
getting over the canal and organizing
a bridgehead. Just below this point
the 3d battalion of the 60th crossed
the river on rafts, and by swimming,
and established itself in the Bois de
Chatillon. The following morning,
Nov. 5, the Eois de Chatillon was
cleared of enemy and the left of the
5th division was able to cross. The
villages of Dun-sur-Meuse and Milly
were captured, so that the net result
of the day was the crossing of the
river and the capture of the whole
line of heights from Milly to Vilosnes.
On the extreme left the 1st division
on Nov. 6 relieved the 80th, while the
42nd relieved the 78th. These two di
visions reached on this date the
banks overlooking the Meuse from
west ot Remilly through Allicourt to
Mouzon.
About 2 p. m., Nov. 6 the command
ing general of the 5th Army corps
came in person to the headquarters
of the 1st division and gave a verbal
order for the 1st division to march
at once on Sedan. The 1st division
in its advance met part of the 42nd
division in Bulson. On Nov. 7 it
encountered the enemy on .the front
Bulson-Chehery-Omicourt. He was
immediately attacked and driven
northward. Meanwhile, patrols of the
42nd penetrated to the edge of the
village of Wadellncourt across the
river from Sedan. In the afternoon
of Nov. 7 the 1st division was with
drawn to the line La ' Besace-Autre-court.
It had marched all of two
nights and part of a third, covering
an average distance of 53 kilometers
in mud darkness, and congestion of
traffic. In addition, it had fought all
of two days.
On the right the Bth division con
tinued it? attack on Nov. 6, pushed

forward with wonderful speed and
captured Muraux, while its left unit
reached and held the Cote St. Ger
main. The advance continued on the
following day, the 5th division being
far 'ahead of the units on its flank.
The 90th had not yet got across the
river, and the 17th French corps, on
the right, which was trying to con
verge on . Breheville, did not succeed
in getting forward until this day. . -'
The 5th division patrols on Nov. 9
reported that the enemy was in gen
eral retreat and an advance in force
was ordered. The villages of Louppy
and Removille were captured, and, in
the evening troops of one regiment
swam the Loison and captured
Jametz. The French took Damvillers,
while two companies on the left ot
the 5th division captured Mouzay, en
abling the 90th division to cross the
river. On Nov. 10 the Foret de
Weevre, a "jungle of trees and heavy
undergrowth with roads knee deep
with mud," was mopped up. Here
the division stood at the signing of
the armistice.
These troops had stormed the
heights east of the Meuse, had pushed
a wide salient to a depth of 15 kilo
meters into the enemy's line, and
had contributed materially' to the ad
vance of the 90th division on its left
and that unit's capUire of Stenay.
The 5th was five kilometers in ad
vance of the troops on its left and
two kilometers beyond the troops on
its right. The division's report says:1
"Its operations form a brilliant ex
ample of what the American soldier
can do in an emergency when he
must go to the utmost extent of his
power." '
The 32nd division moved up to the
right of the 5th division on Nov. 10,
taking over the sector of the 15th
French Colonial division. It ad
vanced west of Brandeville in a fog
that day and a new attack had been
ordered on Nov. 11 when the armis
tice was signed.
Operations East of Meuse.
The 17th French corps, command
ed by General Claudel, which was
part of the French Second army
holding the hills north of Verdun,
was left in place when the First
American army took over the Meuse
Argonne sector. One American divis
ion, the 29th, was assigned to it for
use when the situation should so de
velop that the corps would come into
action.
It was the general plan , to make
the main attack west of the Meuse
while the 17th French corps on the
east bank: held and protected the
flank. However, our troops, as they
advanced on the west bank of the
Meuse, suffered severely from ma
chine gun and artillery fire coming
from across the river, and it soon
became necessary to push forward
the line east of the Meuse so as to
obviate this menace.
The Germans had , massed their
forces east and northeast of Verdun
to protect Metz, as they had believed
that our main attack was coming In
that direction. North of Verdun from
the Meuse eastward they had placed
Austrian troops in line, and it was
against this weaker part of the line
that General Claudel struck.
Violates Principle, of Attack. -
He thus violated the principle of
attack; that is, instead of attacking
perpendicularly to the axis ot the
enemy's line, he attacked across the
enemy's main front. In order to do
this the 29th American division was
brought in behind the ISth French
division and then spread along the

the beginning of the battle; lower
dry canal bed near Samogneaux with
the Meuse at its back.
On the morning of the attack. Oct.
8th, the corps front held as follows:
33rd. 29th, 18th Frenhh and 26th
French.
The 29th division was to seize the
high ground up to the Etrayea
Ridge and the series of intervening
hills and woods, then swing North
east and east in order to push the
enemy entirely from the heights of
the Meuse into the plains of the
Woe.vre, at the same time advancing
to the strong position of Herbebois
and to Flagas.
The attack was unusually success
ful. On the first day the 29th ad
vanced about six kilometers. The
116th infantry took Malbrouck Hill
and pushed on through the woods ot
Consenvoye. This regiment reached
the northern edge of the woods by
noon, but the division on its right
was held up in the Bois d'haumont.
The 33rd division was required to
cross over the Meuse at Erabant and
Consenvoye. Bridges were built at
these two places in broad daylight
under constant artillery fire. The
troops which got across immediately
dug in for the night in the Bois de
Chaumes.
By the evening ot Oct. 9th five bat
talions of the 33rd were across the
river. The infantry reached the fur
ther edge of the Bois de Chaumes by
noon, and patrols reached as far as
Sivrey. Late in the day the Ger
mans counter-attacked with a con
siderable force against the right of
the 33rd and particularly, against the
29th. There was great difficulty in
maintaining contact between the two
divisions. This lack of contact be
came more noticeable on the follow
ing day, when one regiment of the
33rd, having advanced to the edge of
Sivrey, was forced to dig in, in order
to protect its flank. The troops ot
the 29th on that day were under a
terrific concentration of enemy fire.
They made a new attack in order to
get beyond the Molleville clearing,
but on the right no advance could be
made. The left of the division suc
ceeded in joining up with the line of
the 33rd in the Bois Plat-Chene.
Hun Counter-Attacks Fail.
The 3rd division held its positions
without further advance until Oct.
22nd, when it was relieved. The 29th
struggled forward under an ever in
creasing heavy fire. On Oct. 11th a
new attack made no progress. The
following day the 114th infantry, act
ing under the order sof the 18th
French division .attacked the Bois
d'Ormont. Later the 113th infantry
attacked from the northwest and
reached the edge ot the woods. These
troops were unable to hold their posi
tion. On Oct. 13th the enemy deliv
ered two violent counter-attacks on
the 113th, but were unable to drive
our troops out. On Oct. 15th the
113th regiment began an attack
against Molleville Farm and up to the
ridge of La Grande Montagne. ' It
reached its objective on the left, but
was held up on the right. On the fol
lowing day the regiment was relieved
at the edge of La Grande Montagne
by the 26th.
On Oct. 23rd the 29th division
with one regiment of the 26th, carried
the Etrayes Ridge, finally occupying
the Pylone. the observatory on its
crest. On the following day the 29th
division repulsed a counter-attack,
while the 26th attempted to get
through the Bois de Belleu. The
26th repulsed three counter attacks

RANGER, Tex.'," Aug. '16. Construc
tion of the grade lor the Haraon- &
Kell railroad, between Ranger ; and
Jakeliamoir began this ; week with,
gangs working at several points along
the 23 miles -of Buryer. The flatting
of the townsite of Jakehamon is be

timbered part of the site that is about
one-naif of the area of the town. The
underbrushis being- cleared from the
entire site and the street grades will
be established next. The townsite ib
just two miles south and a little east
of tbts old town 6f Desdemona. It lies
on the Comanche county side, of the
line between Erath and Comanche
counties and la in a section of the
field where the best wells are making
but small amounts of oil asstring the
preservation of the townsite from en
croachments of oil well drillers.
Interest in the new town that is to
be built on the new railroad adjacent
to the great Comanche' county oil field
has become so great-' that "people are
driving to the site and selecting their

diately south ol the Humble com
pany's Forgason well, which, ia pro
ducing 4 000 barrels of oil daily, the
Eclipse Oil company is getting a daily
flow of 20D barrels of oil from the top
of the lime. The drill has 200 feet to
go before It penetrans the pay sand,
and it is the belief of the drillers that
the well will develop into a good pro
ducer. This test is situated on a ten
acre let, three miles north of Eastland.
The Arkansas Natural Gas company
is preparing to drill its jthird well on
the 1736 acre C. U. Connellee farm,
three miles southeast of Eastland. Its
No. 2 is producing 250 barrels of oil
and 15,000,000 cubic feet of damp,
smoky gas daily. The oil flow is
gradually Increasing.
Two miles north of Eastland the
Ranger-Stephens Oil company's well
is making 40 barrels of oil per day.
The drillers are preparing to under
ream in the hopes of stopping the
water flow. At present more than
2000 feet of water is in the hole, which
when removed, -rwill allowed the flow
to increase to about 1000 barrels. On
the powntaih tract, Frank Day is set

WILD CAT TO
SEEK FDR OIL
IN PANHANDLE
-FORT WORTH, Texas, Aug. 16.
Announcement was made here today
by the Giant Oil company that a con
tract has been let to the Taylor build
ing company, of Fort Worth, for .the
erection of the derrick for their No. 1
well upon the 8500 acres which the
company will explore in Hall and Don
ley counties, in the Texas Panhandle.
Unusual interest attaches to the
Giant field operations because of the
rapid northwestern extension of the
Ranger and Burkburnett fields of pro
duction and the confident assertion of
geological experts and oil men that
these fields eventually will include a
large proportion of the Panhandle dis
trict. The coming in of the great Hapgood
gas well just beyond the Giant hold
ings recently is understood to have
hastened the Giant drilling program
materially. The Masterson No. 3 and
the Ranch Creek wells since have
come in as big gassers, tending to
prove the Panhandle, field highly and
profitably productive.
The Giant company was launched a
few weeks ago as an out-and-out wild
cat. Its stock was offered to the pub
lic as a straight 'gamble and the com
pany offered no promises other than
that it would drill a deep test well.
DRILL AT MARSHALL.
MARSHALL, Tex., Aug. 16. The
Hope Oil company is preparing to sink
an oil well on the Loum headright, five
and a half miles southeast of Elysian
fields. The derrick is being erected
and machinery is being placed on the
ground. Drilling operations will be
started in a. very short time and the

it is. considered a wildcat test. The
bit is approaching the pay sand rap

AT SHREVEPGRT
SHREVEPORT, La., Aug. 16
Operators are interested in the new
producer belonging to the Standard
Oil company, situated in section 29-21-8,
Caliborne parish. This gusher,
the Oakes'No. 2, is the largest pro
ducer brought in in northern Louisi
ana for more than five years. During
the first hours after completion the
well went Wild and the oil gushed
over the top of the derrick. However,
after a few hours the drillers were
able to control it, and although no
gauge has been placed on the test, it
is estimated as producing 12,000 bar
rels of oil daily with the likelihood of
settling down to 9000 barrels a per
manent production.
The pay sand was encountered in
the Oakes No. 2 at a depth of 2095
feet. This well is the only successful
deep test in the Caliborne oil field,
most wells getting their production
frpm a depth of -from 1180 to 1425
feet: Encouraged by the success of
the Standard company, shallow pro
ducing wells will be drilled deeper
and wells abandoned as dry holes in
this vicinity will also be drilled deep
er. It is genearlly believed now that
there is an unusually rich pocket at
about the depth at which theStandard
well was completed.
Oil operators have gathered here
from all parts of this state, Texas and
Oklahoma to see the "wonder" well of
the month. The excitement of the dis
covery of the field itself a few months
ago hardly equals the prevailing, ex
citement of the monster gusher.

MRS. ffl.KIRKLAND
Was So Run Down At Times She
Couldn't Walk Gains 20 Pounds
By Taking Tanlac
Mrs. Mattie Kirkland, a highly es
teemed resident of 2547 Benton Boule
vard, Kansas City, Missouri, called at
the Owl Drug Store, recently, and
made the remarkable statement that
she has not only gained 20 pounds in
weight by the use of seven bottles of
Tanlac, but that the medicine has also
relieved her of a case of nervous indi
gestion that had made life miserable
for her for three years.
When asked if she would be willing
for her statement to be published,
Mrs. Kirkland said:
"Yes, indeed, for if it had not been
for others allowing the news of their
recovery published I would not not
have known about Tanlac and would
still be a sick Troman. So I feel that
I ought to make a statement myself
and try to benefit some one else. Dur-

Cochise Second County of State With
Population of 58,219, Maricopa Having

PERSHING DIGNIFIED Oil OCCASION. BUT ENJOYS COLLEGE HORSEPLAY
SUNDAY, 'AUGUST 17, 1919.
i mgmmscrm i
Cochise county ranks second In
population in Arizona at the pres
ent time, according to an estimate
issued yesterday by Secretary V. A.
Wood of the state tax commission at
Phoenix. The Cochise figures are set
at 58.219. Marfcopa county leads
with 84,519. The state population i3
estimated at 318.932.
:Thi3 figure is far In excess of the
total of population: figures as given
in the last issue of the Arizona Blue
Book, compiled by Mit Sinims, secre
tary of state. The population of the
state according to the blue book is
277.S36
In arj-iving at the present popula
tion of the state Wood has followed
the method adopted by the tax com
mission last year of basing the esti
mate on the present school popula
tion. Frank Dykes, deputy state
superintendent "of public instruction,
has just compiled the school cen
sus and the figures for each county
have been multiplied by a certain
figure representing the ratio between
the school census figures and the
total population in 1910, according
to the government census.
The total of 2S9.952 Includes Ind
ians. In 1910, according to govern
ment figures the Indian population
was . 22.201. Assuming that this Is
constant, this leaves 360,751 as rep
resenting all other residents. This is
an incerase of 25.SS0 over the esti
mate for last year.

TELLS STORY OF
PRISON T
For Refusal to Make His Bed
Over Twice, Was Sentenced
To Hard Labor, Although in
Serious Condition At Time
As an Instance of the wholesale
disregard of orders and the conse
quent arrest under the court martial
system in vogue in the American
army may be cited one instance of
a soldier who is now living in BIs-
bee. His name is Paul H. Smith and
he was formerly with Company G,
27th - Engineers, arriving in France
last June a year ago.
He was ordered up to the front line
with his regiment and while on duty
in the vicinity of Fismes in the Cha
teau Thierry sector was' wounded by
a piece of shrapnel from a high ex
plosive shell.
He. was taken to Field Hospital No.
4 on August 21, 1918, where he re
mained for nine days being later re
moved to the Red Cross hospital No.
:2 near Paris where he 'remained for
Fix days.
His wound was of such a serious
nature that he was ordered back to
the states immediately for treatment
and was sent on December 30, 1918,
to evacuation hospital No. 8 at Sa
venay near St. Nazaire and was wait
ing embarkation there from Decem
ber 30 till February 10, 1919.
During his ' stay at this hospital,
which was in command of Lieut. Col.
Estill, he was incapacitated for work
by reason of the. nature of his wound
and was hardly able to get around on
crutches. One morning after he had
made his bed. Smith says, the nurse
ordered Jifra to make It over again
as it wasn't made Just right to meet
her notions and when he remonstrat
ed about the matter she reported to
the commanding officer that he re
fused to obey orders and he was or
dered into confinement at hard labor,
according to the order which follows,
by Lieut. Col. Estill, without even
the formality of a trial:
"Base Hospital No. 8, Amex. 17
January, 1919.
"Hospital Otder No. 8.
"(1) Pvt. Paul H. Smith. Ward
A-22, Base Hospital 8, will be con
fined to the guard house for a period
of seven days, and assigned to hard
labor, for refusal to work in his ward
except on orders from the ward sur
geon himself.
"By order of Lieut. Col. Estill.
"L. G. PAYSON.
"1st Lieut San. C. Adjutant."
Paul H. Smith was confined to the
guard house for the seven days al
' though in such a serious condition
that he was being sent home for spe
cial treatment.
' While in the guard house Mr. Smith
was not alone doing hard labor but
on the order of Lieut. Col. Estill, he
snys, there were men doing hard
labor with amputated legs which had
not healed and were constantly bleed
ing from' the exertions of the forced
labor and with no medical treatment
for the injury.
Three Guess Fruit
Weight Correctly
R. R. Belknap, Cecil Cunningham
and Mrs. W. H. Randall showed
themselves real Yankees for guessing
yesterday when they estimated to" a
half pound the weight of the fcrlze
basket of fruit In the Phelps Dodge
Mercantile company competition. The
weight was 84 1-2 pounds and each of
the trio made the exact guess. The
fruit was evenly divided between
them.
Mayor Erlckson acted as the offi
cial weigher late yesterday afternoon.
More than 1800 guesses were recorded.

MEETS BISBEE

Brashear Has Strengthened the
Line-Up For Clash On Locar
Grounds Today; Good Gme
Is Promised to Bisbee Fans
Roy Brashear's rejuvenated base
ball team will line up at 2:30 o'clock
this afternoon at the Warren baseball
park against the- team from the Nine
teenth infantry at Douglas, which Bus
bee defeated at Douglas last Sunday
by a score of 8 to 1. The soldiers are
coming up determined to retrieve
their defeat, but Brashear says his
men have stopped their losing streak
and from now on will hang up a
string of victories. "
Eddie Scott, the Indian first base
man, who has been in Ray some time.
and his brother, an; outfielder who
Scott says is the baseball find of the
season, will be in' today's line-up for
Bisbee. The new Scott will go into
right field; Toner and Price will be
the battery, Scott will be on first,
Brashear on second, Champion at
short and Cams at third. The other
outfielders will be Wade and Burnhill.
Brashear has promised to get a
good umpire so that there will be no
repetition of last Sunday's weird de
cisions at Douglas. '
While Bisbee is playing on the
home grounds, Bert Whaling's Lowell
team will journey down to Douglas to
meet the crack First t cavalry team
which trimmed thi Lowellites at
Warren last Sunday-by a score of 7
to 1. Lowell is somewhat handicap
ped, as Pitcher Brandt was out of the
game last Sunday because of a split
thumb and will, not be in the line-up
today as he has gone to the Texas oil
fields. It is probable that Curley will
pitch for the Lowell bunch.
The Bisbee Cubs, the amateur team
under the leadership of Al Kobey, will
play the Mexican team from Chihua
hua hill at Warren this morning. Next
Sunday the Bisbee regulars expect to
play the First cavalry on the home
grounds.

Fans Coming From Douglas,
Tombstone, Benson, Nogales,
Tucson and Other Sections;
Loughrey Confident of Win
The advance sale of tickets for the
Frank Loughrey-Russell Chambers
fight at the Warren ball grounds on
the night of Aug. 22 has opened with
a rush, several hundred dollars worth
of seats already having been spoken
for. A big delegation is coming up
by train and automobile from Doug
las, while Tombstone, Nogales, Ben
son, Tucson and other points will be
well represented.
"Handsome Jack" McDonald, the
popular referee from El Paso, who
will be the third man in the ring, has
written the Warren District Athletic
club that he will bring up a crowd
from the Pass city. So far Secretary
Tom Egan of the Warren District Ath
letic club and O. S. French have been
booking the only orders for tickets.
On Monday, however, they . will be
down town, to be announced later.
Loughrey is training as hard as if
he i was going against Les Darcy,
Mickey King or Georges Carpentier
again and announced yesterday that
hp was already in the "pmk" and
down to weight. He is hitting the
road every morning and is getting
back his wind, which was somewhat
affected at first by the altitude.
Loughrey is confident he is going to
win this match and is already talking
about Labor day bouts and a fight
every week after his victory, which
he declares is sure. A lot of the wise
ones who have seen Chambers in the
ring and who have watched Loughrey
at work are ready to back the local
boy against the soldier, although they
admit the fight will be no walk-over
for either one.
The preliminaries also are arousing
keen interest.
It was decided definitely yesterday
that there will be no Labor day bout,
the Fox-Lincoln scrap having been
called off. Lincoln and Burns will
clash for the third time at Nogales
the night of Aug. 23, according to
word from there yesterday. G. J.
Kelley, who made the Labor day
match here for Fox and Lincoln Is
now striving to arrange dates for
.both of them on the big holiday.

Enforce the traffic laws
GOUNTY CTnu cny uinuan "
paign thav are waging against speeders and violators in gen
eral of trie automobile and traffic laws. One fatal accident
is just ope too many. There are enough accidents of the
"unavoidable" character to contend with without the vastly larger
number of mishaps that are due to the original carelessness of the
automobile driver. '
The limit for speeding within the city is fifteen miles an hour.
Any one who drives a machine knows that this is a painfully snail
like pace. At the same time, even the most careful driver must
admit that in the narrow streets of Bisbee with its congested traffic
at many points, evon fifteen miles an hour will have its dangers.
The present ordinances fix four miles an hour as the maximum
speed in turning corners. This is impracticable and no autoist pre
tends to attempt an -observance of this regulation. The average
automobile cannot be throttled down to this speed in rounding
cornerl, particularly on a grade. 1 '
The city attorney and the police committee of the council are
now framing a new automobile ordinance to take the place of, the
present antiquated statutes. They should fix the speed limit around
corners at, say ten miles an hour and then see that this regulation
- is rigidly enforced. " : i '
It is no .pleasant task1 the policemen and deputies have in nab
bing violators of the traffic ordinances To be fined $5 for parking
within a few feet of a fire; plug,' or to pay a .$10 ilne for parking too
' long in the street, seems a rank injustice to the automobilist who
becomes the victim, of the law. And yet 'it is on the strict observ
ance of , these minor regulations that the effectiveness of the traffic
laws asa whole depend.
Both municipal and cotinty judges have determined that they
-will do their share in helping the police and deputies enforce the
laws. The old, lax system of leniency and letting the offender oft
with a reprimand has gone out of date. The magistrates have
rightly agreed that Jail sentences' will be imposed where it seems
necessary to curb the speed mania of the habitual boulevard burner.
!The new ordinance now being drafted will be drastic in a num
ber of points, but there is no doubt that its. strict enforcement will
make the streets and highways of this section safer for both pedes
trian and automobilists and cut down the number of accidents avoid
able and ''unavoidable."
v
THE BOXING "GAME"
"I1
'N MY Judgment the way the game is now going, it will ne
cessitate some action soon to maintain the sport on a clean
-SL1 basis or boxing contests will soon be a thing of the past, as
the publtc will' not stand for such. work. Sincerely yours,
"THOMAS E. CAMPBELL."
- In the above excerpt, from a letter written to one of the boxing
promoters of this district, the 'governor has manifestly spoken a
whole volume of truth. It is to be hoped that every boxing club in
the state-will take the Thief executive's little warning to heart, and
nowhere is such a warning more needed than in the governor's own
bailiwick at Phoenix.
The boxing club at the capital has matched Ad Wolgast, a good
boy and a great fighter in his time, against an ambitious and husky
youngster from California, for Labor day. Pitting the unfortunate
Wolgast against any sort of a boxer has aroused a storm of protest
all over the state among the men who are interested in boxing as
a manly' and entertaining sport and who want to see it kept on that
basis. ' .
Wolgast is, no't to be blamed for getting what matches he can,
but the men who have encouraged him and who have gone to the
extent of dragging the little ex-champion back into the ring from
the walls of a sanitarium, deserve some plain words.
Unfortunately Arizona's boxing bill does not contain provisions
for a boxing commission. Such a board, if for no other reason than
to safeguard the sport of boxing, would instantly forbid such a
match. Our boxing bill does, however, provide that a boxer must
undergo a physical test at the hands of a competent physician be
fore entering the ring. It is to be hoped that this regulation will
be rigidly enforced In Wolgast's case. Our guess is, however, that
before Labor day the force of public opinion will have compelled the
abandonment of the Wolgast-France match.
ACADEMIC historians are iona oi saying mat ""'
, the Revolutionary to the Civil War and from the Civil to
.the World War wllf fill but few pages in American history.
Politically speaking this true that is, if the events are
considered only in which the .country participated officially or as a
whole.
But there has been as much or more progress in peace as In war.
Social progress is. in Industrial and commercial development
quite as, much' as in political events.
Here is a very partial list. of Important American inventions
since the ..Revolutionary War; indicating that we have filled many
pages in our history in the. pursuit of happiness not only our owi
but that of the whole world: '
Shear plows, sewing machines, telegraph, cotton gins, steamboats,
rotary and web printing presses, harvesters, chemical refrigeration,
vulcanizing rubber, electric lights, storage batteries, oil refining, tele
phones, electric motors, automatic screw macihnes, interchangable
manufacturing, commercial form of automobile, aeroplarites. air brakes,
power elevators, tall office buildings, bicycles, type composing ma
chines, moving pictures and aluminum.

PHOENIX WOMAN ROBBED
OF GEMS WORTH $3,500
PHOENIX, Aug. 16. Declaring to
the, manager of a Long Beach hotel
that she had been robbed of diamonds
and other jewels to the value of
$3,500. Mrs. Angus : Mackay of
Phoenix, has broken . into the lime
light at the coast city and into the
newspaper columns.
The missing jewelry, according to
Mrs. Mackay, is a bracelet set with
fifteen diamonds and also a diamond
missed after a lively night spent by
Mrs. Mackay in company with two
men and another woman at a hotel in
Long Beach.
Mrs. Angus Mackay, whose home in
Phoenix is at 740 East Adams street.
left this city several weeks ago in
company with a young woman to tour
the east. ' Considerable time was
spent at Niagara Falls and eastern
cities and about three weeks ago they
arrived at Los Angeles, registering
at the Alexandria.
The death of Angus Mckay at Oak
land,. California,-a year or more ago
was followed by a hotly contested suit
in court in Phoenix. An attempt was
made by the Mackay family to break
the will of Angus Mackay, in which
he left practically his entire estate to
her. The suit was ended by a settle
ment in which Mrs. Mackay was given
$175,000 in cash and $1,200 a month
for life. v
SHAW'S VULCANIZING WORKS
SEIZED FOR TAXES
DOUGLAS, Aug. 16. The vulcan
izing machinery and other fixtures
and belonging of the Shaw Vulcan
izing Works at the corner of .Thir
teenth street and G avenue were
seized this morning by Chief Deputy
Assessor Walter Thomas, who is in
the city from Tombstone. The seiz
ure was for the taxes of the current
year, which amount to $49.38 with
costs of seizure and sale to be added.
Notice will be given of the sale date
and the property will be sold publicly
to the highest bidder In case the
taxes are not liquidated.
Mr. Thomas says that other delin
quent property is being looked up in
this city and that unless demands for
tax payments are compiled with other
seizures will be made. .The law
makes it the duty of the assessor to
collect the taxes on personal property,
when assessment is made if the own
er has no real estate and in- default
of a bond for the taxes.
The vulcanizing plant has'not been
in operation for pearly two months.

left town. " -r ' -
ELECTRICIAN IS ALMOST
KILLED BY LIVE WIRE
' DOUGLAS, Aug. 16. George H.
Clay, an electrician for the Douglas
Traction and Light company, had a
narrow escape from instant death this
morning in Pirtleville, when he was
thrown across a live wire carrying
220 volts of electricity. As it was, he
received serious burns and will prob
ably lose his left hand, though it -is
believed he will survive.
The accident happened when Clay
was changing a wire, on a new pole
recently installed oa the Pirtleville
line. He was about i!5 feet from the
ground, clinging . to the pole by his
"spurs," as the sharp iron pieces are
called, when one of the spurs slipped,
throwing Clay on top of the live wire.
Fortunately his body remained in
contact with the wire only a few sec.
GIRL S'TOWAY FOUND
IN AN ARMY AIRPLANE
DOUGLAS, Aug. 16. Atouch of
romance was injected into the pros
saic grind of military affairs when a
pretty Mexican girl, aged 18, well
dressed and speaking good English,
was found hidden in an army air
plane yesterday morning at 5:15
o'clock at the aviation field at Camp
Jcnes. . Evidently the girl had tried
to conceal herself in the plane in the
hope of getting a ride without being
discovered or that she would be per
mitted to go up even. if discovered..
The pretty stowaway was discov
ered by army guards who were pa
trolling the field, not. however, until
after she had eluded the guard and
crawled into the machine, where one
of the soldiers happened to see her
while passing the airplane. It is pre

As it was he was frightfully burned
across the left side and in his left
hand, which will probably have to be
amputated.
Homer Nally, chief, lineman for the
company, was with Clay at the time.
He picked up the prostrate form of
his comrade from the ground and
rushed him to the Calumet hospital,
where it was stated this afternoon he
had a fair chance for recovery.
Mr. Clay resides at 15(59 F avenue
and i3 unmarried.
SMALLEY WILL AID FOOD.. .
ADMINISTRATOR IN ARIZONA
TUCSON.. Aug. 16. Geo. H.'Smal-
ley of Tucson, has again been called
Into government service to aid Timo
thy A. Riordan, federal food admin
istrator for Arizona. ' ,
Mr. Smalley was with the food ad
ministration during the war. It is
estimated that the food administra
tion saved householders of Arizona
more than $50,000 a month. This
action is the direct outgrowth of the
government's investigation of the
high cost of living.
It is understood that the fair price
board will be reorganized in Ari
zona. These boards were of great
help to the state food adminitsration
during'the war. : They had inspectors
and secre't service men to look after
the interest 'of"1 the consumer and at
the same time see - that the whole
saler and retailer make a fair profit
and do not engage in profiteering.
ASK HAY STATISTICS

PHOENIX, Aug. "16 The rate de

fight instituted by the commission
against what that body characterizes
as unjust rates, forT.he shipment of

The inquiry hs been sent to the
Phoenix Chamber of Commerce, Hig

out an observer, and it is believed
she thought the flier might get in the
back seat (she. was lying down in
the front seat) and take the air with
out seeing her.
The girl was detained under guard
until about noon yesterday and was
closely questioned by army officers.
However, it was apparent that she
was not a spy, nor bent on an errand
of destruction. When the officers
were satisfied that she had stowed
away in the .airplane purely in
spirit of adventure, she was allowed
to go.
She told her questioners that she
was in the habit of rising at 4 in the
morning and going for a walk, which
statement the officers are said to
have taken with a grain of salt. She
i intimated that she had ridden in air
planes before and was not afraid. She
told her name to the officers, but it
was not divulged.
ADJUTANT GENERAL MUDDLE
, DUE FOR A FURTHER DELAY
PHOENIX. Aug. 16. In spite ot
the fact that both sides are anxious
to get the contest fpr the office of
adjutant general settled, it has been
ascertained that it will be impossible
to hold a hearing in the quo warranto
proceedings before September 6. 1
It was stated yesterday, at ..the at
torney general's office that an : effort
had been made to get Judge Stanford
to assign; the case to Judge Pattee
and hold the hearing in Tucson. The
judge is on the coast and cannot as
sign the case without being In
Phoenix. The first' sitting of the court
will be on September 6, at which
time it is expected the matter will
be argued by attorneys for both sides.
STRIKES ROCK IN DIVE
AT SWIMMING-POOL
NOGALES, Aug. 16. Yesterday in
St. Joseph's hospital, in Nogales,
there died as the result of an accl
dent experienced the preceding day,
Prisciliano Mercado, known well in
both Nogales', having resided in No-
gales, Sonora a number of years
where he had served the public as
"regidor" (town trustee), in which
post his death at this time leaves a
vacancy.
With a party of friends Mr. Mer
cado went to the Santa Cruz ranch
of Earnett brothers, for an 1 excur
sion of rest and recreation. On the
place there is a reservoir filled with
water to a depth of about six feet.
The party went bathing in the reser
voir. In making a dive from
height of about six meters, Mr. Mer
cado struck his head violently on the
bottom, fracturing his skull and
breaking his neck.
The injured gentleman was brought
to Nogales straightway and hurried
across the line to St. Joseph's hos
pital, where Drs. Gustetter and Smel
ker were called to attend him, but
their efforts were without avail and
he passed away yesterday.
HELPING UNCLE HENRY.
When Mike Cassidy heard the sad
news that the Chicago Tribune had
lost the big libel suit and had to pay
Uncle Henry Ford six cents for call
ing the flivver king an anarchist, he
promptly sat down and mailed the
Tribune a check for $10.06, the ten to
renew his subscription for a year and
the six cents to pay the fine. It's
tough to lose a libel suit by even six
cents, but Oh, you advertising!
WE'LL SAY IT DOES.

Henry Ford lacks only six cents
of being . an . anarchist entitle
him to membership In the
Order of Parlor Bolshevists? .

SPEAKING OF COLD STORAGE.
While in Chicago a couple of weeks
ago, Ed Tovrea, the Bisbee packer
and cold storage expert, got . enough

Some of the "live ones" connected
with the packing houses of the Windy
City, who had met Mr. Tovrea and
learned of his business, invited him
to a dinner and when the crowd had
assembled around the luxurious table,
the waiter brought on a couple of
chicken, informing the big Western
er with considerable pride that they
had been in cold storage for twenty
years. Mr. Tovrea is fond of chicken
and a firm believer in refrigeration,
but this was a little too much for him
and he balked.
GOOD SHERLOCK HOLMES WORK.
Unless you want a fight, don't
mention Fords or Flivvers to
Dick Hoffmeyer, proprietor of the '
Orient, at Lowell. Dick has had
a Ford for several years, which
he has nursed with all the care a
teething baby would receive. A
daily bath and plenty of lubri
cants kept the little rqachine
looking and running like new.
Though the Ford has been Hoff
meyer's hobby ever since Le ac
quired it, he has not been stingy
with the little car and Las al
ways invited his friends to make
use of it. Every day it has stood
across the street in the shade,
and the boys who wanted to take
a rest and a little smoke and
"gass" a bit have found it a com
fortable reclining place. Sun
day afternoon four or five of the
young fellows were perched up
in the car all afternoon. Hoff
meyer drove it home that even
ing as usual, curried her down,
put her to bed in the garage.
Next morning he boarded the
flivver and found the hear seat
had been completely burned out.
Why the whole car didn't go up
in flames will always be a mys
tery. Mr. Hoffmeyer started an
investigation at once and found
that one of the boys had dropped
a lighted cigarette in the uphol-
stering. which had ignited. He
even found the cigarette stub, a
Chesterfield. Ha, Watson! The
mystery is almost solved. Find
the young man who was smoking
. Chesterfield cigarettes Sunday
afternoon. No sooner said than
done. As a result of his clever
Bleuthing, Mr. Hoffmeyer will
get damages for the injury to his
pet car, but he will tell the world
. that cigarette smokers are barred
hereafter.
HONEST TO JAWN, IT'S TRUE.
Did you read the Octavus Roy
Cohen story in Saturday Evening
Post a few weeks ago about the
two colored fighters who met in
the ring, only to find that each
one had bet on the other?
Cohen describes the efforts of
each man to lose In an amusing
manner, but for a' real "punch"
to the story he should have inter
viewed G. J. Kelly, . the boxing
promoter and baseball scout,
who was in town this week.
Kelly was refereeing a, bout on
the coast where the two boys, it
proved, had each placed a bet on
his opponent and both were try.
Ing their best to lose without be
ing assassinated by the crowd.
Finally one of the lads, a quick
er thinker than the other, evolved
the only way out. He suddenly
began fighting like a demon, and
smashed his opponent a right
hander on the point of the jaw.
"Here's where I win," thought the
groggy pugilist as he eagerly
sank to the floor. But the other
boy promptly walked up and
kicked him in the face, losing the
. bout on a foul. .

real task and many abandoned the

GOD SPEED FOR PROF. BLOHM.
Mr. Lee H. Blohm, one of our
much esteemed members and princi
pal of the Bancroft Junior High
school for the past three years, left
Friday noon for a visit with his rela
tives in Beardstown, Illinois. He will
be met by his family there and then
proceed to Washington, D. C, prior
to leaving for his new work as foreign
consul. His ninth grades entertain
ed the faculty In his honor Thursday
evening, serving ice cream and cake.
The members of his faculty presented
him a remembrance showing the high
esteem in which they held him. The
entire community wishes him and his
family God speed.
INTERESTING PROSPECTING
TRIP.
Mr. Alonzo Crittenden, who in
company with James Manson has
been on a prospecting trip in the
mountains near Hachita, returned
Thursday. He reports the roads in
bad shape, but - passable. Considerable
road building is going on in Arizona,
including the splendid paved boule
vard in construction from Douglas to
Bisbee. In New Mexico, however,
they are not-so progressive, and no
attempts at road building were seen.
They were able to play the "good
Samaritan" to three automobile
parties who were stuck in the mud.
At Hachita they visited the camp ol
the 12th cavalry (the bulldogs of the!
border), where Crittenden was army
i secretary -a f snort while ago.
From there they' went into the moun
tains. If you go s there at this time
of year you had best take some mos
quito netting, as the gnats, flies and
mosquitos attack one with, an enthus
iasm worthy of a better cause. Also
for climbing the mountains take bur
ros or an aeroplane, and maintain a
watchful and conservative attitude
towards rattlesnakes. The people
everywhere were very friendly with
the absolute and unconscious democ
racy of the ranches and the moun
tains. Some day we will have good
roads all over this country perhaps
when the poets' dream is realized ol
"Every grim ravine a garden., Every
j blazing desert tilled."
TO ENTER U. OF C.
Nemo Debely, one of our musi-
cians and much esteemed members,
left Thursday for California, where
he will enter h the university at
Lerkeley to take up chemistry.
RETURNS TO BALTIMORE.
Mr. Henry Wm. Aiken, who has
been here on business in the interest
.of -the Canion Air Brake company,
left Wednesday for Baltimore, Md.
Henry says he misses the' Bisbee "Y"
exceedingly while in Baltimore, and
his only regret is that he cannot
move the Bisbee association with him
to Baltimore. Mr. Aiken expects to
return to Bisbee again for a short
stay the early part of next year,
which will be good news tcthis many
friends in the district.
SPANISH CLUB.

I have not seen any of the town yet
as we are forbidden to leave the bar
rack grounds. They are breaking up
our company and a bunch are leaving
for Paris this afternoon. I am ex
pecting to be sent to Germany.
When I got off the ship I was sur
prised to see people wearing wooden
shoes. I don't see how they can walk
in them. I suppose it is like any
thing else though, we can get accus
tomed to them.
What is going on in Bisbee? I
suppose you are having fine times.
at least I hope so. You must remem
ber me while I am over here. It gets
kind of lonesome now and then.
I like the army fine, but don't like
the idea of carrying a pack. It is a
good load for little me and a lot of
trouble.
I can't tell you much about over
here in this letter so will have to
close now. Write soon and often..

but the fourth drove our troops out ot
the woods. Elements of the 2Gth
moved forward again during ' the
night and sncceeded in reaching the
northern edge of the woods. Further
to the right two battalions made two
attacks against Hill 300. They took
the hill, but were unable to hold It.
On Oct. 27th the 20th division, as
sisted by the ri?ht of the 29th,
launched a general assault which
linally cleared the Belleau woods.
Advanced troops got into the Bois
d'Ormont, but had to fall back.
The 29th d'vision, between Oct.
2Sth and 30th, was relieved by the
79ih, which had just then shifted
over to the right by the 3rd, this lat
ter coming up on the lije of the
Meuse heights from Fresnes to a
point one kilometer from Woel. The
79th on Nov. 1st also took over part
of the 26th division's sector, the lat
ter moving to the front from Bois
d'Ormont to Beaumont.
Crpture Towns on Day of Armistice.
The 26th division patrols on Nov.
9;.h reported that the enemy was re
treating, and the line began a gen
eral advance. On the following day
both the" 26th and the 33rd attacked,
the former making only slight prog
ress. The latter unit captured the
village of'Marcheville and the Bois
des Harville Early on the morning
of Nov. 11th the 33rd division attjck
ed again, capturing Raiville, Pinthe
ville, Malzeray and Harville. It was
in these positions juu Nov. 11th when
the armistice was signed. On the
front of the 26th an attack had been
ordered, but the signing of the armis
tice prevented it.
From Sept. 26th to Nov. 11th the
German army commanded by General
von der Marwitz, used forty-six dif
ferent divisions in the line against
our forces; thirteen of these were
engaged twice and two division were
in the line three times during this
period. The Germans threw in one
third of his total forces in France
pgainst us in this battle and saved
his badly tangled troops by a with
drawal behind the Meuse and the
signing of the armistice.
Columbia Records
Rich in Song For
Month of August
Columbia records are rich this
month in the sort of scngs that are
as much a matter of current knowl
edge as the standings of the Major
Leagues. Comment on how Van
and Schenck sing "Oh! How She
Can Slag." is, superfluous for any
one who hasrever heard this popu
lar team. Billy Murray sings in his
inimitable manner on the reverse oi
. thip record. "And That Ain't All
Irving and- Jack Kaufman oblige with
a contradictory tenor duet entitled
"Some Day You'll Be Sorry Thai
You're Glad," coupled with Henry
Burr's tenor solo, "Yon're Making a
Miser of Me."
' Irving Kaufman unburdens himself
of the advice. "Take Your Girlie to
the Movies (If You Can't Make Love
at Home)." and this is coupled with
Arthur Field's extremely individual
rendering of "Pig Latin Love," a
snappy song with lots of laughs in it.
The Sterling trio sings ,"My Swanet,
Home" and on the reverse cf this
record Campbell and Burr tell about
"My Sugar-Coated Chocolate Boy" In
a tenor duet.
"My Little Sunshine" sung by
Charles Harrison, is a song that radi
ates love, happiness, joy, and youth
It's just a simple little love song of
the sort that makes everyone join in
the chorus. This song is coupled with
"How Can You Sav Good-Bye ?" suns
by Irving and Jack Kaufman. This
duet is a catchy melody and is by
'far the best effort yet of this com
paratively new combination.
"July the Thirst" is what moved
Bert Williams to sing "Everybody
Wants a Key to My Cellar" for Colum
bia records this month. But Bert
avers: "They can have' my wife if
they want to go that far, but they
can't have the key to my cellar if the
whole darn world goes dry."

HOME LOAN PUN
MORGAN BILL
By CAPT. KENT A. HUNTER.
Posts of the American Legion in
Chicago and all over Illinois are lin
ing up solidly behind a bill recently
introduced in congress ' by. Represen
tative Dick T. Morgan- of Oklahoma,
by which any honorably discharged
soldier, .sailor or marine may borrow
$4,000 from the government to buy
or build a home, repayment to be
made within a period of sixty years,
with interim interest on the principle
of 3 1-2 per cent per year.
A $100,000,000. Project.
Congressman Morgan's bill pro
poses to create a government corpor
ation with 5100,000,000 capital, .sub
scribed by the federal government.
The corporation is to be authorized
to make a loan ud to $4,000 to any
honorably discharged, soldier, seaman
or marine, to be used in the purchase
of a home. Loans may run for the
J entire time limit ot sixty years, or
taken up in whatever payments the
soldier can make. The interest is to'
be 3 1-2 per cent on the unpaid prin
cipal, with amortization payments on
that, 'made annually.
The loan may be made to the full
appraised value of the home and its
improvements.
The $100,000,000 capital to be fur
nished by the government under the
bill will be used as a working or re-
volvmg fund. The fbief funds toij

ample reserve or guarantee fund. '
Soldiers will not have to break
home ties, leave their friends, give
up their present emnlovment' and
business, and go to distant states to
obtain the benefits of the act. The
benefits will be equitably distributed
to every state and community.
In opposition to this plan is the one
proposed by . Secretary Lane, em
bodied in the Mondell bill, now pend
ing before congress. Under this bill
only farm homes will be provided,
thus preventing fully 50 per cent ot
soldiers, who reside in towns and
cities, from taking advantage of its
provisions.

lands. These lands are then to be,
so.d to the soldiers at an estimated
average cost of $r,,000 for each farm;
ranging from. forty to eighty -acres.
The bill authorizes- an appropriation
of $500 000,000 out or the -United;
States treasury. i
Under the estimate, this would pro !
vide homes for about -80,000 soldiers,;
which is less than 2 per cent of the'
service men. To take advantage of,

from $1,000 to $1,800.
i There are more than 2,000 posts of
the American legion, with an average
membership of more than fif
bers. Each post is "plugg:

the Morgan bill, and many have
adopted resolutions which have been
sent to congressmen, urging them to
vote for it. ,
