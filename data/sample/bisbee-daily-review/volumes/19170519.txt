PERMISSION TO REG
U. S. VOLUNTEER DIVISION
T. R.'s Proposal Would Seriously Interfere With The Prompt
Creation And Early Use of An Effective Army, Declares
President In Statement; Says Teddy Wanted To Have
Many of The Nation's Best Officers Taken From Army
And Assigned Under Him.
WASHINGTON, May 18. Colonel Roosevelt will not be
permitted to raise his volunteer expedition to carry the
American flag against the Germans in France.
On signing the war army bill tonight, President Wilson
- issued a statement saying that acting under expert advice from
both sides of the water, he would be unable to avail himself at
the present stage of the war of the authorization to organize
volunteer divisions.
There was talk in army circles tonight of the possibility
that a way would be found to use the former preseident's ser
vices in another way, but official comment on the subject was
lacking. The president's statement follows:
""I shall not avail myself, at any rate, at the present stage
of the war, of the authorization conferred by the act to organ
ize volunteer divisions. ,To do so would seriously interfere
jwith the carrying out of the chief and most immediately im
portant purpose contemplated by this legislation, the prompt
creation and early use of an effective army, and would con
tribute practically nothing to the effective strength of the
armies now engaged against Germany.
Roosevelt Is Rebuked By the President
"I understand that the section of
this act which authorizes the crea
tion of volunteer divisions in addi
tion to the draft was added with a
view of providing an independent
command for Mr. Roosevelt and giv
ing the military authority an oppor
tunity to use bis fine vigor and enthu
siasm in recruiting the forces now
at western front
Wilson Speak Plainly
"It would be very agTeeable to me
to pay Mr." Roosevelt this compliment
and the allies the compliment of send
ing to their aid one of our most dis
tinguished public men, an ex-presi,-dent
who has rendered many con
spicuous public services and proved
his gallantry in many striking ways.
Politically too. it would no doubt
have a very fine effect end make a
profound Impression. But this is not
the time or the occasion for compli
ment or for any action not calculated
to contribute to the immediate suc
cess of the war. The bus:ness in
hand now is undramatic. practical and
of scientific definiteness end preci
sion. I shall act with regard to It
at every step and in every particular
under expert and personal advice
from both sides of the water.
Wanted Too Much
"That advice is that the men roost
needed are men of the ages contem
plaled in the draft provision of the
present bill, not men of the age and
sort contemplated in the bill which
authorizes the formation of volunj
teer units, and that for the prelim
inary training of the men who are
to be drafted we shall need all of
our experienced officers. Mr. Roose
velt told me, when I had the pleasure
of seeing him a few weeks ago, that
he would wish to have associated
with him some of the most effective

There are no figures on the amount
of wheat bought here by the allies

named many of those whom he would
desire to have designated for the ser
vice, and they were men who cannot
possibly be spared from the too small
force of officers at our command for
the much more pressing and neces
sary duty of training regular 'troops
to be put into the field ifi France
and Belgium as fast as they can be
gotten ready.
"The first troops sent to France
will be taken from the present forces
of the regular amy and will be under
the command of trained soldiers only.
Issues Too Immense
"The responsibility for the success
ful conduct of our own part in this
great war rests upon m.e I could not
escape it if I would. I am too much
Interested In the cause we are fight
ing for to be interested in anything
but success. The Issues involved are
too immense for me to take into con
sideration anything whatever except
the best, most effective, most Imme

these means are men have seen war
as it is now conducted, who have no

and let everything else wait.

I do otherwise, whatever the argu

clare one cause for the recent sharp

Army Bill, Providing For 2,000,000 Trained Men To Back Up
First Troops, Is Signed By President; Full Strength of
, National Guard Will Be Drafted Into Regular Army Be
ginning July 15; Force of 500,000 Men To Be Raised
Without Crippling Nation. I
WASHINGTON, May 1 8. President Wilson tonight or
dered that a division of regular troops commanded by
Major General John J. Pershing be sent to France at the
earliest practicable date.
This is the answer of America to France's plea that tr
Stars and Stripes be carried to the fighting front without delav
to hearten the soldiers battling there with concrete evidence
that a powerful ally has come to their support against German
aggression.
Announcement of the order followed signing of the selec
tive draft war army bill by the president and the issuing of a
statement that under advice of military experts on both sides
of the water, the president could not employ volunteers nor
avail himself of the "fine vigor and enthusiasm" of former
President Roosevelt for the expedition.
The army law provides for an ultimate force of approxi
mately 2,000,000 men to back up the first troops to go to the
front. When the bill had been signed the president affixed his
name to a proclamation calling upon' all men in the country
between the ages of 21 and 30, inclusive, to register them
selves for military service on June 5, next. The proclamation
sets in motion immediately machinery that will enroll and
sift 1 0,000,000 men and pave the way for the selection of the
first 500,000 young, efficient soldiers without crippling the
industries of commerce of the nation or bringing hardship o
those at home.
Gigantic Military Operations Under Way
Even before the bill was signed the
war department announced that the
full strength of the National Guard
would be drafted into the United
States ermy beginning July 15 ana
concluding August 5. Orders to bring
the regiments to full war strength Im
mediately accompanied the notifica
tion sent to all governors. A minimum
of 329.000 fighting men will be brought
to the colors under those orders, sup
plementing the 293.000 regulars who
will be under arms by June 15.
Other Forces t Follow.
It is from these forces that the first
armies to join General Pershing at
the front will be drawn, to be followed
within a few months by recurring
waves from the selective draft armies,
the first 500.000 or whom will be mob
ilized September 1.
Following is the text of the terse an
nouncement of the war department as
to General Pershine'a expedition:
"The president has directed an expe
ditionary force of approximately on
division of regular troops, under com
mand of General John J. Pershing, to
proceed to France at as early a date
as practicable. General Pershing and
staff will precede the troops abroad.
"It Is requested that no details or
speculations with regard to the mobil
ization of this command, dates of de
parture, or other Items, be carried by
the press. Other than the official bulle
tins given out by the war department
relating thereto."

army camps will be in the southern
part of the country.
In all tbe forces first to be formed
will comprise seven divisions 'of regu
lars, four of which will be available
for mobile duty in continental United
States, supplemented by sixteen Na
tional Guard divisions and later by six
teen selective army divisions. Behind
this force a. second call on the selec
tive forces, provided for in th bill,
will add sixteen additional divisions.
Allowance to Be Made.
Allowances must be made when tbe
military census of men between the
specified ages has been completed, for
probably variation from .census bureau
; estimates s to the total number of
I persons in this classification. It is
regarded as unlikely that the registra
tion will show the exact 1,200,000 per
sons liable, fixed by the census esti
mate. There will be some delay also
in hearing from men absent fi'om their
homes who will register by mail. The
officials of every slate and town, how
ever, have been authorized to issue
cards to such men in their communities
in order to avoid delay.

ships was discussed and a tentative
decision was reached to niodify the
jecond class mail rate and automobile
land musical instrument tax sections
of the measure.
Convinced of the inequity of the sec
tion naming the rate on second class
mail matter now contained in the bill,
the committee virtually decided to sub
stitute the Moon act, once included in
the postoffice bill, which would fix a
' flat rate of one cent a pound on read
j ing matter and the parcel post zone on
j advertising matter. Under this plan
'publishers would make their roturns to
the pjstoffice department and be
j charged accordingly. This proposal,
,as well as the one to Iowjr the automo-
bile and musical instrument 5 per cent
,tax now contained in the bill, will xe
' reive further consideration as the daily
meetings of the committee's progress.

per regiment must be increased be
cause of the nature of the fighting in
Europe.
General Pershing has been in
Washington several days. He was
personally summoned by Secretary
Baker from the southern department
which was under his command until
tonight's order was issued.
The man who led the expedition
into Mexico and handled his difficult
task with such judgment and skill
as to win for him the complete con
fidence of the President and his ad
visors has worked hard on the plans
of the expedition to France. He has
been in daily conference w-ith Secre
tary Baker and with Lieutenant Gen
eral Bridges, of the military Bectlon
of tbe British mission, and a veteran
of the battlefields of France.
Careful Selection.
There Is every indication that the
regular forces which will compose the
expeditionary division are being se
lected with greatest care.
No inkling of the plans for that di
vision have been allowed to' leak out.
The number of men in tbe expedi
tionary force has not been disclosed.
A division at war strength totals more
tr-an 25.000 men of all arms.
General Pershing, a Republican In
politics was a brigadier general when
he led the forces into Mexfco in pur
suit of the bandit Villa. His work
at that time won for him selection
ty his brother general officers as a
major general and the choice was
heartily endorsed by the war depart
ment and President Wilson.
Regarding Roosevelt
In his explanation of his reasons
for not availing himself of the so-
called Roosevelt amendment to the
army bill, Mr. Wilson has brought
out sharply the points Inade against
that amendment by army officers, re
gardless of their personal political
leanings, or their regard for Mr.
Roosevelt. Many officers have un
hesitatingly condemned his proposal
to raise a volunteer army corps or
division on the ground that it would
the regular service of men vitally
needed to train the millions that must
be quick-ly whipped into fighting trim.
The list of regular army officers
Colonel Roosevelt desired to take
with him has been the subject of
much speculation ani comment. It
has been regarded as virtually cer
tain that Major General Leonard
Wood was the former president's se
lection' for commander.
Under the plains for the .war de
partment General Wood has been as
signed the hardest task of any gen
eral officer. He will direct, as com
mander of the southeastern depart
ment, the mobilization and training
of twelve divisions or more than 300,

BISBEE'S PART IN THE LIBERTY LOAN.
Commendable in the extreme is the start made in the
Warren District towards an organized effort to aid the
nation's finances, through the medium of the Liberty
Loan. The action of the Warren District Commercial
Club, in setting aside a night for the holding of a mass
meeting, is a step in the right direction and with the
ultimate organization should result in placing Bisbee's
name, high in the (llst of communities which have rallied
to the support of the United States in round, gold bullets.
Little trouble was experienced in raising the first bil
lion dollars of the loan. It meant the skimming of the
concentrated and accessible investment cream of the
country. It meant the calling of the roll of the big cor
porations, the banks and some of the investors. Some of
the heavy subscribers represented individual clients and
acted only with treasuries rich in recently accumulated
assets but also with foreknowledge and intent. Among
them a million dollar subscription seems" like a white
chip.
Too much optimism was aroused through the first sub
scriptions to the Liberty Loan. Inversely, there was the
accompaniment in too little popular interest The first
stride must now be succeeded by a careful, systematic
effort on the part of the government to the end that the
tiny springs of savings may be turned into that great
channel which will make of this counry the proven envy
of the balance of the world. The great bulk of the Amer
ican people, waking now to the size of the task involved,
will have those lessons impressed by the campaign for
the loan, conducted locally and upon which a real start
has been made by the commercial club. The people must
learn effective and intimate teaching the dual lesson
of patriotism and thrift involved. Each subscriber in
serving first his country cannot help, incidentally, serv
ing himself, through history's strongest investment.
Bisbee the Warren District is extremely fortunate
at this stage of our history. We have been in the midst
of a prosperity, undreamed of three years ago, and one
which has come more directly into the hands of the
people than any ether business revival the world has
ever known. Top wages and high values have piled
wealth into the coffers of local people and promise to
continue so doing. As a result the people of this com
munity find themselves with savings or in a position
where they can begin saving. Each dollar applied to the
Liberty Loan is not only a lessen in thrift but it is put
ting into circulation money which will come back into
our own pockets.
What England could do, in a canvass from which the
banks were excluded, was shown in her latest great war
loan of over five billions of new money from over eight
million subscribers. If the United States or Bisbee will
do as well as did England, and we are in a position to do
much better, the results will be astounding.
It is just as much an act of patriotism to buy a bond as
it Is to save the food supply of the country. It is nec
essary that the world be impressed with the solidarity of
this country and the first demonstration of this can be
made through an oversubscription of the Liberty Loan.
Bisbee, an integral part of this republic, should do
its part.
DOUGLAS IS PROPER PLACE.
General Henry A. Greene, in command at El Paso of
the United States troops, heads a commission which ar
rives in Douglas today to investigate cites for the bis
concentration camps soon to be organized. In our opin
ion there is not better place on the entire border and,
more especially, on the Arizona-New Mexico border for
the location of such a unit than the Smelter City.
Cheap water, a mile square of land and immense drill
and parade grounds are necessary for the . proposed
camps. Each location will house in the neighborhood of
22.000 men. They will consist of the civilians drafted
into the service of the Uuited States army through the
army bill which was passed Thursday and was signed
yesterday by President Wilson.
Douglas has plenty of land, adjoining the city. Dougta
has cheap water to offer the government. It is near the
border and ha been used, advantageously, by the le
partment in previous mobilizations. It is on a main line
railroad. ;Tlie weather is equitable, on the whole, and it
is to be sincerely hoped that the concentration camp for
this region of the Southwest will be established there.
Bisbee offers its co-operation, to that end. to the Smel
ter City. r
WAR OR CIRCUS?
With as much irresolution and levity as is witnessed
in the sessions of the Duma and the Council of Work
men's and Soldier's Delegates at Petrograd, the House
at Washington, 'having rejected Mr. Roosevelt's private
army, at length accepts it in principle, says the New
York World.
By this action the Senate amendment which died in
conference will become a law, except as a veto may halt
the enterprise, but the disfavor of the President may be
be shown in other ways. The bill simply authorizes the
acceptance of a personally conducted force such as Mr.
Roosevelt suggests. If as Commander in Chief a Presi
dent Intent upon actual war fails to avail himself of the
invaluable services of this great undisciplined army with
self-appointed officers and no existence except upon
paper, the creation of a real fighting army will not be
much longer delayed.
Nevertheless, two weeks of priceless time have been
lost in the wrangles resulting from Mr. Roosevelt's re
fusal to serve his country as other men must do, and
even now there is no assurance that the Army Bill will
not be held up still further in the interest of his mis
chevious demands. All other Americans of military age
are subject to draft as privates, or if ambitious to be
officers, like himself, must undergo intensive training and
instruction. With little experience, by nature insubord
inate, always a sensational showman, and giving evi
dence daily that he has no true understanding of the
situation at the front or of the difficulties of transport,
Mr. Roosevelt, who condescends to enlist as a Major
General, talks lightly of placing his legions in the
trenches in a few weeks. If such a thing were possible
and to be allowed, he and his followers would be ruth
lessly slaughtered and his country humiliated.
On the very day that the House was indulging in this
fantastic performance, turning into a miserable farce
the most serious business that the Nation ever faced,
the President was solemnly warning the American people
of the sacrifices and sufferings that surely await them.
We may easily Imagine the glee with which the machine
like German General Staff must contemplate its newest
enemy making ready forwar with such juvenile faith in
the methods of the chorus of the circus.
Whatever is genuine in Mr. Roosevelt and his battal
ions ought to be used very cheerfully and thankfully to
strengthen the army of the United States soon to be in
preparation for service abroad. All that is merely theat
rical and boastful and fraudulent in them can only hinder
the mighty work in hand.

According to Tucson newspaper ad
vices, the war department is consid
ering Tucson for a monster training
camp for the drafted recruits some
time this summer or early fall. It is
said that the camp contemplated will
accommodate in the neighborhood of
20,000 men. It will be entirely sep
arate from the camps now located at
border points but will be located tlcse
enough t the border for any emer

CUCKOO CLOCK ROUTS

at dinner, tCbk considerable jewelry
and other trinkets. From the fact that
he left considerable stuff which he
might have taken with ease convinced
Cruice that the clock acted as the bur

VICTORY. '
Our first, big war victory has been won. The nation
has risen nobly to the. call for more food, and already our
efforts are bearing fruit Instead of starving, and lettins
our European friends starve, the present prospect is that
we shall have enough food this year to feed the world
if necessary.
The Chamber of Commerce of the United States, aftei
an exhaustive investigation, reports that the winter
wheat -crop will be normal, the spring wheat crop pro
mises S great production than last years, ana n we
should not have as much wheat to export as would be
necessary, there seems a strong probability that we shall
have other available food supplies such as corn, oats
potatoes and the like not only in full measure, but run
nfhg over."
This promised plenty. It should be understood. Is not
the free gift of nature. If we have a fat year msteaa 01
the lean one we feared, it will be because of earnest, in
telllgent, concerted effort on the part of the whole nation
And the bountiful iiarvest is not yet wholly assured. It
depends on continued effort. The trenches we hav
taken from the great enemy. Hunger, must be held at all
costs. We must "fight it out on this line" all summer
But the hardest part of the battle is over. We have the
enemy on the run.

SELECTIVE DRAFT IN
Premier Declares Entry cf
United States Into War Wnl
- Have Splendid Effect On
Nation's Future.
(By Review Leased VVire).
OTTAWA, Ont.. May 18. Compul
sory military service on a select iy
basis to raise Immediately at least
50,000 and probably 100,000 men to
make good the wastage in the Cana
dian army crops in France, was pro
posed to parliament late today by
Sir Robert Borden, the premier, who
returned from England last Tuesday.
Under the voluntary enlistment
plan Canada had done well, the prem
ier said. There had been dispatched
326,000 men for the Canadian force
across the Atlantic. Including Brit
ish, French and other reservists, not
less than 360,000 men had gone from
Canada' for overseas military service.
But more were needed. Sir Robert
announced, unless the five Canadian
divisions were to dwindle to four, to
three and to two.
Sir Wilfred' Laurier. the opposition
leader, declared that Canada must re
main in the war to the end and that
provision must be made to enable her
to do so.
"A great struggle lies before us in
this war,"' said Sir Robert. "At-the
commencement of this spring's cam
paign Germany put. into the field a
million more men than she put into
the field last spring.
"Unsettled political conditions in
Russia undoubtedly have handicapped
the. effort on the eastern front and
enabled Germany to make a great ef
fort on the western front.
"Against these considerations is
the fact that the Viiied States has
entered the war on the allied side.
The event must exercire a very im
portant influence Indeed, not only
upon the Issues of this war, but upon
the future of the world. The fact that
"cit-'zens of the United States are to
f ght, 6ide by side with the soldiers
of our empire, cannot but have a
sp'endid influence on the future of-
the two nations.

I never tasted

Pie Crust
(Report No. 9) By the manager
Here is my first ex
perience with Cotto
lene pie crust:
One night, early this
month, our Lancaster
County cook, Alice, an
nounced: "You all are
going to have a real black
berry pie tonight. I used
a jar of berries from Mr.
David's box, and Cot
tolene." I was glad she had
.used Cottolene'. I want
ed to see how it worked.
But I was sorry later
that Alice liked that pie.
We four bachelors left
nothing for her but the
big blue pie plate.
Lynn.who comes from
Lexington, K7., said it
reminded him of the
blackberry pies his old
mammy used to make.
And Dave, who is in the
telephone business, got
rid of his before we had
a chance to say "Hello".
I never ate a Thanks
giving pie at home that
beat that one.
I noticed the lower
crust especially. It was
light and flaky. I ate
every bit of it, which 19
a thing I seldom do with
lower crusts.
After it. was all over,
we cast ah unanimous
vote for Cottolene. We
have used wholesome
Cottolene ever since.
Only last night Alice
made a Cottolene apple
pie that was a wonder.

All Men Needed
The power against which we are
arrayed has nought to Impose its will
upon the world by force. To this end
It has increased armament until it
has changed the face of war. In the
sense in which we have been wont
to think of armies there are no armies
in this struggle. There are entire na
tions armed. Thus, the men who re
main to till the soil and man the fac
tories are no less a part of the army
that are in France, than the men be
neath the battle flaes. It must be
so with us. U is not an army that
we must shape urn! train for war;
it is a nation. To this end our peo
ple must draw close in one compact
front against a common foe; But
this cannot be if each man pursues
a private purpose. All must pursue
one purpose. The nation needs all
men; but in the endeavor that will
best serve the common good. Thus,
though a sharp shooter pleases! to
operate a trip hammer for the forc
ing of gre2t puns, and an expert ma
chinist desires to march with the flag,
the nation is bning served only when
the sharpshooters marches and the
machinist remains at his levers. The
whole nation must be a team in which
each man shall play the part for
which ho Is best fitted. To this end

congress has provided that the na

selection and that each man shall
be classified for service 4n the place
to which it shall best serve the gen
eral good to call him.
Manhood Must Be Ready
The significance of 'this cannot be
overstated. It is a new thing in our
history and a landmark in our pra
gress. It is a new manner of ac
cepting and vitalizing our duty to
give ourselves with thoughtful devo
tion to the common purpose of us
ail. It Is in no sense a conscription
of the unwilling; It is rather selec
tion from a nation which has volun
teered In mass; it Is no more a choos
ing of those who shall march with
the colors thnn it is a selection of
those who shall serve an equally nec
essary and devoted purpose in the
industries that lie behind the battle
line.
The day here named la the time
upon which all shall present them
selves for assignment to their tasks.
It Is for that reason destined to be
remembered as one of the most con
spicuous moments in our history. It
is nothing less than the day upon
which the manhood of the country
shell step forward in one solid rank
In defense of the ideals to which this
Nation is consecrated. It is important
to these ideals no less than to the
pride of this generation in manifest
ing its devotion to them, that there
be no gaps in the ranks.

James F. O'Connor .representing the
Little Bobble Mining Company, arrived
in Bisbee yesterday from Phoenix, the
headquarters of the organization. He
will remain here indefinitely conduct
ing a campaign of stock selling.
Little Bobbie is little known in this
region or Arizona, except I'j a few peo
ple. The company has control of six
claims in the Ray District adjoining
those of the Broken Hill and the Ray
Lead and Development Company. Like
the two mentioned companies, the indi
cations on the Little Bobbie 1'Jint to
the presence of high grade lead-silver
values.
One of the most remarkable mines
in central Arizona is that of the Ray
Lead and Development Company, for
merly and better known as the Haley
Sufferein group. An immense tonnage
of the carbonate ores of silver and
lead was develo'ped before the present
company was incorporated.
Work has already been started on
the Little Bobbie. A tunnel is being
driven into the hill to cut the main
dike and in which ore is supposed to
lie. W. J. Graham, of Lewell, is presi
dent of the company and S. J. Ross Is
secretary-treasurer.

FAVOR GOVERNMENT
CONTROL OF FOODS
(Continued From Page One)
Representatives of rain exchanges,
nfter seeing Mr. Hoover, issued a
statement advocating creation of a
government food administration for
the duration of the war.
George W..Anderson of Boston, spe
cial assistant to the attorney general
in charge of food Investigations, told
the house agricultural committee dur
ing the day that unless rising prices
were checked a social upheaval might
be expected. Mr. Anderson urged
that the administration's food con
trol legislation be passed promptly.
Charged that a middleman's trust
controls the country's food supply
were made to the agricultural depart
ment by a producer. The charges
were turned over to the justice de
partment and the federal trade com
mission. A prohibition bill introduced fni
the house by Chairman Webb of the
judiciary , committee, would prohibit
the use of foodstuffs in the manu
facture of alcoholic liquors.
