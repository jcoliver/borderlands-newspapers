(By Review Leased Wire)
UNDATED WAR LEAD, BY THE
ASSOCIATED PRESS. The troops of
the French General Berthleot have de
livered a successful blow against the
Germans northwest of Rheims which
adds materially to the menace that is
hanging over the German front from
the North sea to the Swiss border.
This was the capture of Berry Au
Bac, on the south side of the Aisne
about ten and a half miles northwest
of Rheims and only a scant five miles
from the eastern end of the famous
Chemin Des Dames ridge at Craonne.
A further advance northward across
the railroad not alone will put the
great stronghold of Laon in a pocket,
but also will outflank Neufchatel, an
other enemy stronghold on the west.
Tlfe Turks also have suffered a seri
ous blow in the loss to the French of
Beirut, capital of the Vilayet Syria.
The occupation of this seaport on the
Mediterranean by a French naval di
vision gives the allies a base for the
landing of men who can operate in all
directions against the Turks over the
roads radiating from it.
Although peace talk is still in the
aV there is no peace for the German
and Austro-Hungarian armies in the
Held.
While attempts are being made in
"well informed circles" in Germany
and Austria to show that the latest
peace proposals of the Central powers
are honest expressions of a desire for
r "just peace," Marshal Foch's armies
are proceeding without pause in their
task of clearing Belgium and France
of the invaders. And they are con
tinuing to meet with great successes.
Likewise in Serbia and Albania the
Serbs and Italians are fast reclaiming
enemy-occupied territory, while at last
reports the British General Allenby in
Palestine still was hard after the re
treating Turks.
While further gains have been made
by the British east of Arras, where
the operations have, in view of the

All along the front from Rheims to

The indications are that it will not
be dispatched for a day or two.
While there may be som? question

question whatever as to Its nature. It
may not nsp the short and forteful
term "unconditional surrender." whicn
i already laid down can be accepted.
and that those terms canno' be made?
merely "thp basis for negotiations." as
to an armistice such a step would be

ern iront of the Germans seems to be
in a rather serious situation from La
Fere to the north of Verdun. Laon.
the great storehouse of the Germans
northeast of Soissons, is reported to
be on fire, indicating tne possibility
of an early falling back. The Cbemin
Des Dames defenses are outflanked at
bcth ends. Rheims has been restored
and the Germans pushed back more
than ten miles north of it, while east
ward General Gouraud's armies and
the American first army are brilliantly
carrying ou ttheir part of the great
converging movement that seemingly
at no tar distant date will force the
enemy materially to readjust his line.
A further indication of the troublous
times in the Germany army is the re
port that Field Marshal Von Hinden
ourg has resigned after a stormy in
terview with Emperor William, during
which Von Hindenburg informed the
emperor that a German retreat on a
large scale was necessary.
YANKS TAKE TOWN.
. WITH THE AMERICAN ARMY
NORTHWEST OF VEKuiiN, Oct. 7
(By the Assaciated Press.) The Am
ericans achieved another important,
though local, success today by forcing
the Germans out of Chatel Chehery,
northwest of Apremont.
Pushing forward they overcame the
stubborn resistance of the enemy and
settled themselves on the commanding
heights west of the River Aire.
Nothing of importance occurred on
the other portions of the American
front throughout today.
The troops in the center of the at
tack met the first obstacle ten minutes
after starting in the shape of German
trenches. The Americans deluged
these with hand grenades, carrying the
entrenchments. They reached their
first objective in record time and en
tered Chatel Chehery at 8:40 o'clock
wiih only slight resistance.
An attack on hill 244. where the
Germans occupied strong po&iiionsi
was begun at once, and there was des
perate fighting as the Americans
stormed the heights.
In tue meantime other infantry de
tachments filtered through in single
tile into Abbe wood and helped to
carry hill 244, which was taken before
noon. The troops reached the north
side of the hill by 1 o'clock in the
afternoon, while others advancing
over the Chenelon Du Ridge and pass
ed La Viergette.
The enemy retired eore this ad
vance and the victory was complete at
3 o'clock. The lines at Chatel Che
hery were strongly consolidated and
patrols began reconnoitering ahead,
meeting with little opposition...-.'
The German artillery fire on tile
right had grown quieter than on any
previous day. The extreme right,
which had been bombarded from east
of the Meuse, reported a notable ces
sation of this fire, and some change
in its direction to further north. Great
movements of artillery to the north
and northeast have been noted above
CuneL
The machine gun fire likewise nata
bly decreased on the center, east of
the American line. This was especial
ly true of Cunel woods, which has been
a veritable hive of machine guns, but
these were quiet today. ; .

COLORADO IS QUARANTINED
PENVLR. Colo., Oct. 7 State-wide
action against the spread of Spanish
influenza In Colorado was taken late
this afternoon when Governor JuliU3
C. Gunter signed a proclamation call
ing on all mayors and municipal
health authorities to use unhesitating
ly their authority in prohibiting all
forms of public gatherings.
The governor's proclamation urces
the immediate closing of all churches,
schools and other public places. The
only exception made is in the case of
colleges where miiitary camps are
maintained and when these camps are
guarded by proper quarantine regula
tions. The issuance of the proclamation
followed a conference attended by the
heads of the six largest uniersities
and colleges of the state. Under the
plan devised lor meeting the epidemic
in these institutions the student army
training corps activities are to con
tinue, members of the corps being un
der quarantine regulations and with
all in-door class work eliminated. In
colleges where there has not as yet
been an appearance of the malady
some class work for other students
may continue, but it will be out door
and the students themselves v. iil be
under strict regulations aimed to
guard against contraction of the disease.

the close of business Friday the 11th.
It is necessary to close the list on
Friday to give the paper time to set
them up for publication Sunday. A
number of subscriptions were taken
by the committee last week that did
not get into the banks before the fol
lowing list of names were prepared
lor the press. These names will ap
pear in the next list.
A number of the workers have re
ported uncivil treatment by some of
the people they visited and solicited
to buy Liberty bonds. Orders have
been received to report the names of
any and all persona who treat the
workers with disrespect, or even in
difference. These particular persons
may answer for their offenses when
called to explain their attitude toward
the success of the fourth Liberty loan.
The people f the Warren district
will need to bend every effort and
not only lend till it hurts, but LEXD
TILL IT HELPS, in order to raise
their quota of $1,450,000. This is their
share of the burden in raising the $6,
000,000.000 our country must have
from the sale of the fourth Libert?
lon bonds to keep our boys full speed
toward Berlin. The faster they go the
faster we must raise the money to
keep them supplied with bread and
bullets. Plenty of these two instru
ments in the hands of our boys and
cur allies will hasten the war to a
successful close.

SIGNS OF HIS CALLING
De screech owl up de chimbley screech.
He screech till he raise a row;
En I reckon dat am a call ter preach
Kase I aint got a call ter plow.
Oh, Jordan's road, hit's lonesome.
En de ribber, hit run strong;
Put I'll wear a crown when de cross lay down
En I'll sing de glory song.

test. Her gallant soldier son should not be
called anything like that with her approval.
But at once came a bunch of letters from
soldiers, insisting that they didn't at all
mind being called "doughboys." In fact,
they rather liked it.
Fighting men don't mind a nickname
that has the qualities that make it stick,
provided it is rough enough. The sailors
are proud to call themselves "gobs." In
spite of disapproval from some quarters
- in the south, the Stars and Stripes, the of
ficial organ of the American forces in
France, persists in calling the soldiers
"Yanks." The only name they really ob
jected to was "Sammies." 4 The chances
are it was a misunderstanding of the French
cry of welcome to the first Americans who
landed, "les amis" ("friends"), pronounced
"lay zamee." Anyway, nobody wants to
" be called "Sammy."
CAVALRY HAS ITS DAY
General Allenby has crushed the Turkish
Seventh and Eighth armies in Palestine by
means of the brilliant and wonderful aid of
his cavalry.. His cavalry has closed every
exit except one, which cannot be reached
by many of the enemy, and in a wide en
circling movement his horsemen broke
down all attempts to put up delaying, rear
guard fights.
The cavalry captured Nazareth, Nablus,
Beisan and Jenin and had one charge on
the plain of Armageddon and another at
Jenin, secured an enormous quantity of
valuable booty and we have not heard the '
last of their efforts.
Once the infantry had broken through
the southern defenses, the cavalry had great
opportunities, while the infantry has con
tinued to display superb skill and endurance
in driving the enemy from hills between the
Plain of Sharon and the Judean Plateau.
The cavalry movements were perfectly
timed and have been a masterly success.
Their unfailing regularity of fulfilling the
plans laid down by the staff suggests they
were regulated by the clock.
British yeomenry, Australian light horse
and Indian cavalry, all in magnificent con
dition and in a high state of training, have
performed a feat almost without parallel in
this war. The critics who declared the day
of cavalry is over must hide their heads.
The utter defeat of the Turkish Palestine
army would not have been possible but for
Allenby 's bold use of cavalry.
'A LONG, LONG TRAIL A WINDING"
(Maj. Donald Guthrie in Scrihuer's Maeazine.)
"In June, 1916, we Canadians lost sev
eral lines of trenches at Ypres salient. A
few days later a couple of Highland battal
ions were sent up at night to retake them
which they did, promptly and cleanly. The
thing was hardly mentioned in the news
papers, though our casualties must have
run more than (en thousand.
"I shall never forget seeing a battalion
of the Canadian Black Watch swing past
our clearing station, on their way to the
salient and to a deadly job of work. The
moon was very bright. The paved road
flowed in front like quicksilver, until lost
undcr ilie arching elms. A big, solemn, un
tethcred goat led the battalion, and always
took the right turn of the road. He strutted
stiffly and was not without a certain dig
nity. The pipes and drums came next ; but
they were silent as they passed, for the men
in columns of fours, company after com
pany, were singing.
"Most of them carried their steel helmets
in their hands and marched bare-headed in
the cool moonlight. They were headed for
ghastly Ypres and a hot fight. Yet they
sang, and the piece was 'It's a Long, Long
Trail A Winding.' Somehow gloomy
Ypres was forgotten, and the lads inner eye
saw 'the land of their dreams.' 'Whistling
shot and sneering shells were unthought
of, and they heard 'the nightingales in the
pale moon gleams.' Yet ahead lay Ypres
and rough, red handed work. And they
swung, singing, into the shadowy depths of
the elms, and their song merged into the
slight night noises of a summer evening,
undertoned by the pulsing diapason from
the eastern horizon 'the deep ground tone
of human agony.' That damnable salient
where you got it from three sides; red
seeing, hard straining, close gripping fight
ing there a mile or two up the moon
blanched paved road. And going to the
salient, was this winding column of kilted
men, care free, light hearted, song filled,
while the patriarchal goat always took the
right turn in the road which meant a lit
tle nearer those trenches which must be
retaken.
NO SIGN OF GERMAN REVOLT
(Kansas City Star.)
The evidence upon which some opti
mistic persons base their expectation of a
revolution in Germany will seem to most
observers to be without value. Food riots,
so-called peace demonstrations and even
declarations in the Reichstag mean nothing
so long as there is no organized political
movement looking toward control of the
militarists or the democratization of the
government.
No such political developmant has taken
place in Germany during the war so far as
outside observation can detect. All that
has reached our ears has been an occasion
al lament, not very loud, over the refusal
of the government to redeem its repeated
promises of suffrage reform. Nowhere has
there arisen a party or leader with a demo
cratic program or any proposal for action
that would indicate a recognition that Ger
many's troubles have been brought on it
by the aMtocracy. That there has been and
is discontent in Germany may be conced
ed, but very little of it has been political
discontent. It could quickly be appeased
by the slightest evidence that the militarists
were going to bring home the promised
loot, or by any trifling concession of the
government. It never has raised a hand
or a voice against kaiserism even under the
worst suffering imposed by the war.
Herr Muehlon, the FCrupp director, who
may be supposed to know his own people,
says there never in his lifetime has existed
a real liberal political opinion in Germany.
Even men who believe themselves liberal
could not be relied upon to adhere to a
party group, for the reason that they could,
almost without exception, be beckoned
away by the crook of the kaiser's finger or
flattered by any empty order, title or mere
attention from the governing class into
complete submission. The Germans take
readily to bureaucratic government because
it provides a multitude of petty offices,
titles and distinctions. Almost any German
can be an excellency or something equally
unimportant and ridiculous if he Truckles
patiently enough, and having attained that
rank most Germans are devoted props of
the autocracy from that hour.
Plainly this is not the kind of people that
make revolutionists, especially when they
have been subjected to generations of mili
tary goosestepping. They may growl when
they are hungry, but give them full stom
achs and they will go empty headed of poli
tical or democratic aspirations for genera
tions without end. Germany's upsetting
must come from the outside.
Kansas City Star: If you ever looked out
the window of an express train and saw an
elderly lady with a bird-cage and an um
brella signaling it to stop and pick her up at
a cross-roads, you have an accurate picture
of how Lord Lansdowne looks to the Eng
lishmen he is calling upon to stop fighting.
Seattle Post-Intelligencer: According to
Hindenburg, a salient io a military vantage
point a general takes because he does not
want it and gives up in order to make the
operation victorious.
Punch (London): We are informed that
owing to the unexpected prolongation of
the war, Mr. 1 1. G. Wells will readjust his
ideas on the subject quarterly instead of
twice a week as heretofore.
PRESIDENT CONSULT.
ALLIES BEFORE HIS
REPLY IS FRAMED
of the Central powers to lure their
people on to more bloodshed and sac
rifice. There is a suggestion that to carry
out this purpose more freely. Presi
dent Wilscn after dispatching the re
ply, may decide to address congress
and state in detail the reasons which
caused the allies to reject the proposal.
There is no official indication that
the president plans such a course, but
it is being discussed among many pos
sibilities. Cel. E. M. House, the president's
constant advisor, and person repre
sentative on many confidential er
rands, arirved at the White House to
night. His coming fo'lowed a busy
day for the president, in which all
other business was put aside, recrea
tion was abandoned and except for an
hour or two given over to entertain
ing Sir Eric Geddes, first lord of the
British admiralty at luncheon, Mr. Wil
son spent the day in his study. It
was said he was writing.
The official communication from
Germany was delivered to the White
House this morning by the charge of
the Swiss legation and the note from
Austria was taken to the state de
partment and handed to Secretary
Lansing by the minister from Sweden.
The president already had the un
cfficial texts as transmitted by the
Associated Press before him and the
official copies added little or nothing
to his information.

Another consideration which has in

the probable effect upon the German

and unreasoned refusal of their ap

We Gotta Buy Bonds.

Pa wears his old clothes, old gloves and old shoes,
Ma sports an old suit and wears her darned hose.
Big sister refrains from sweetmeats and candy
Though she used to be absorbed about all that was handy.
And aunt Elmerina, she's proud and all that
But believe me she's wearing her last winter's hat.
And even the baby, you may think I'm a liar,
Use3 the same old bottle and a worn pacifier.
Of course there's no mention of our vacant chair
For big brother Jim has gone over there.
But even old Shep gnaws the same old bone,
For we gotta buy bonds in the Liberty loan.

GRAIN MARKET.
CHICAGO, Oct. 7. Big downward
swings in the value of corn resulted
today from selling drives which were
in the nature of efforts to discount
the possibility of a general peace.
Trade, however, although at times on
a bread scale, did not as a whole at
tain great volume. The market closed
heavy, 6Tc to 9c net lower, with No
vember $1.22 to $1.22 H and Decem
ber $1.21 to $1.21.
Oats finished l!iC'to 2c down, and
provisions off 27c to $1.
At first the corn market made only
comparatively moderate response to
the announcement that Germany ask
ed an immediate armistice, and for
negotiation of peace. It soon became
manifest that the initial absence of
any extraordinary selling pressure was
due to recent drastic liquidation by
holders and to the Vact that would-be
short sellers were greatly in doubt as
to the likelihood of Germany's request
being granted.
Subsequently, though, lack of buy
ing support became so apparent that
ine speculative ciemert srew aggres
sive, 'and made a series of attacks on
prices, especially after midday.
In consequence, last transactions
were virtually the lowest of the ses
sion.
Oats fell with corn, but were stead

Provisions merely reflected the
weakness of grain and hogs.

so far among the doctors about con
trolling the disease. The public has
viewed the matter as have the doctors
and all are doing their utmost to stop
the spread of the disease.
IS IN FRANCE.
Mr. and Mrs. James Barrett of
Tombstone have received a letter from
J. C. Duga, who formerly resided
there, having been employed as a
truck driver for Bunker Hill Mines
company, who is now in France. He
states that he was in active service
and enjoying himself and was right
up where the fighting is going on, lis
tening and dodging the shrapnels. In
part he said. "I haven't got any
(Huns) to my credit, but hope to soon.
France is a beautiful country. I like
it fine, but hope to be back in good
old U. S. A. victorious soon. Our
boys are doing fine. I think, don't you?
How is Tombstone? Hope she Is O. K
Well, I must close as it is gettfrig late
and we haven't a light at night. Give
Jack Esser anil the rest of the bunch
my best wishes."
COMMITTED SUICIDE.
According to parties in Bisbee yes
terday from Gleeson, Cap Powers, an
aged miner and prospector who has
resided in Gleeson and vicinity for
the past dozen years, committed sui
cide at his place near the Kendall
ranch Saturday evening. It seems
that Powers being very ill of an in
curable disease, refused to go to the
hospital at Gleeson for treatment, but
owing to his precarious condition, his
neighbors there made arrangements
anyhow to take him there Saturday
nleht, and when he learned of this
while they were cone, committed the
rash act. When the neighbors return
ed they found him dead with a bul
let wound in his heart and the gun
lying beside him on the bed. The
authorities were Immediately notified
at Gleson and Coroner Sullivan im
mediately formed a jury and went to
the Bcene. The body was taken to
Gleeson and buried there yesterday af
ternoon. AUSTRIAN OFFICIAL.

' Arizona, on tlu 14th day of November,
Last evening about 5 o'clock David; 1913. -Wali-h.
an auto driver, better known j Claimant names as witnesses:
as "Pinky," while under the influenie i James L. Brooks, of Bisbee, Arizona,
of intoxicating liquor, took the car of, Charles .McUowan, of Bisbee, Ari

J Copper Queen company, which was;
standing alongside the l.opper iueen.
store and started up the Subway at a
lively gait. As he passed the Copper
Queen dispensary. Officer Sheppeard
saw him and ordered him to sto;;, but
the drunk crazed man only inrre.is d
his speed and tried to make the turn
to go up the street between the dis
pensary and the Allen block, hut he
was going at such a rate of speed that
he could not make the turn and rah
directly upon the perch and start; d up
the steps into the oflics of Judsje
High.
The front of the machine was uiIIy
damaged, the windshield being brok
en, two springs broke, and tile blown
out and the running board smashed.
Walsh was not thrown out of the car
but was cut over the nose with the
glass from the windshield.
He was taken out of the car by the
officers and taken to the dispensary
where the doctors endeavored to dress
his wounds, but he refused to lei
them. He was held by the officers
until it was bandaged up and then
he was taken to jail. On the way to
the jail he tore the bandages off.
That there was not someone injured
by him in his drive was remarkable as
streets were filled with people and n
just happened that there was no one
crossing from the Bank of Bisbee to
ward the dispensary or coming down
the street in front of the Allen block.
Judge High had just started out of
his door to come down the steps
when the car hit the bottom. Had he
been two seconds earlier he would
have been caught between the car
and the building. The car just missed
the iron pillar that supports the iron
girder that holds a part of the second
story. Had it been broken serious
damage would have resulted.
This is the second accident that has
happened in the city during the past
week by men driving cars while in an
intoxicated condition and some drastic
action should be taken. The stieets
of Bisbee are narrow and with hun
dreds of people walking on them and
across them, it is .time that thiy t)
given protection from not only driv
ers iu an intoxicated condition but
from some of the reckless drivers
that make it daugeious to cross the
streets. The lives of children' and
citizens of the district should be pro
tected. It has not been determined yet by
Mr. Finnotti whether or not he will
swear out a complaint charging him
with the theft of the car which is a
felony and punishable by imprison
ment in the state penitentiary. The
damage to the car will amount to
about $150. A charge of driving a car
while in an intoxicated condition will
be filed agaiust him in the justice
court. This is punishable by six
months imprisonment in the county
jail and a fine of $200, or both.

FIVE YEARS OF AGE DROVE
STAGE IN EARLY DAYS
Yesterday the Warren district com
munity board shipped out twenty-six
men to Norfolk, Va., where they are to
be given employment by the govern
ment around the navy yards at that
place. Among the number was J.E.
Rathani, who has been a familiar char
acter about the district for a number
of years, and who worked at odd jobs.
He is a man 75 years old, but is hale
and hearty and was anxious to go and
stated before he left that if he got
that far east he was going to see serv
ice in France if he had to stow him
self aboard In order to get over there.
Mr. Ratham la a pioneer in Arizona.
He has lived here for over forty years.
He drove a stage over the old Butter
field route from Fort Bowie to Tucson
before the Southern Pacific railroad
was built. He drove six horses. At
that time the route ran from Fort
Howie through Apache pass, through
Wilcox, via Dragoon, and then crossefl
the San- Pedro river at Tres Alames.
about nine miles below Benson, and
then on into Tucson.
He is an old Confederate veteran,
and also saw service for thP govern
ment In Cuba and the Philippines as a
teamster. He will endeavor to get in
that service again if possible while he
is in the eas,t. He has many friends
in the Warren district, who hope that
he will realize his" ambitions and be
able to get across to France to do his
share in the cause of democracy.
