LONDON. April 4. General Sir
William R. Robertson, chief of the
Imperial staff at army headquarters,
addressed a conference of trades un
ionists today for the purpose of ex
" nlainine the eovernment's proposal on
the question of man power. General
Robertson emphasized the fact that
while the war office was not a leech,
it must have more men to meet the
desperate effort the enemy was now
making. His speech, as officially
Klren out. was in part as follows:
"Our prop-ess with the war is
bound to be slow because of the col
ossal numbers engaged and because
Germany derived a great advantage
at the start. It is a difficult and long
business to make up for a bad start.
Germany Not Whipped
"As to the retreat from the Somme
the pessimists say Germany is mak
ing fools of us and laying traps. We
are not in any way disturbed by her.
At all times pessimists are cowards,
while in war time they may be class
ed as criminals. Whatever happens,
keep a, cheerful face. The optimists
say Germany is defeated and is there
fore', retreatting. Both are wrong.
Enemy Stronger'!) Ever
"Germany is retiring because she
cann"ot7stand up to her punishment
in the positions she occupied. No one
retires in war voluntarily. But she
is not yet beaten. She 1b going back '
in the hope of becoming stronger, and
numerically she is stronger now than '
at any time during the war. She has
now many more divisions in the field
than last year, and has increased the
number of her soldiers by about a
million.
More Men Needed
"We must meet the desperate
enemy effort and must have men.
We ought not to expect to win a
war such as this unless, and un
til every man and woman in the
country does a full day's work of
an essential nature. Our imme
diate needs are a half million be
tween now and July.

The bills carried appropriations of
more than $440,000,000. They were

I am perfectly confident of success,
provided we are determined to win.
But the way to victory may be long,
and certainly will be hard. Our navy

result that many of our people are
still ignorant of the urgency of our
position or of the sacrifices and mis
eries our allies have had to bear. But

Representative Padgett, chairman of
the naval committee introduced a bill
t'oday to permit the President to take
over boats, including small craft, in
case of war.
FACTORY WHICH WOULD HOLD UP II. S. FOR 111
NECESSARIES IS THREATENED WITH SEIZURE
(By Review Leased Wire).
WASHINGTON. April 4. Today the
government invoked for the first time
its drastic powers to strike a death
blow to exorbitant war profits.
Under authority of the last naval
appropriation bill a manufacturer was
directed to furnish a large order of
war supplies at a price fixed by the
government far lower than the figures
voluntarily submitted. If the order is
not obeyed the plant will be taken
over and operated by the government.
Officials would not disc rose the name
of the manufacturer nor the agency
through which the order was given.
It was said, however, that President
Wilson and bis advisors were firmly
resolved that only fair and reasonable
charges should be paid by the nation
to its citizens for the things that are
necessary to make ready for war.
European governments are paying
an average of ten per cent profit on
war material purchased in the United
States. It was asserted authorita
tively that the government of the
United States intended to buy its own
supplies at less than that rate of pro
fit to the seller.
Standing out sharply against this
background came an announcement to
day by Bernard Baruch, commissioner j secured by Mr. Baruch with the cop

brass-making industry t fill the gov-'copper producers and similar arrange

WASHINGTON, April 4. De
tailed plans of the war depart
ment for organizing an army num
bering millions if that is neces
sary "to bring the government of
the German empire to terms,"
was placed in President Wilson's
hand. today in the form of a bill,
prepared by the general staff and
. reviewed and revised in part by
Secretary Baker and the general
officers who are his military advi-
' sors.
The President, as commander-in-chief,
already, has approved the
basis adopted for the war army.
Secretary Baker said today the
measure would go to the house
and senate committees assoon as
the war resolution was adopted.
Major General Scott, chief of
staff will explain the plan and the
military reasons for the need , to
train the number of hen the bill
will provide. This is believed to
be not less than two million to be
trained within two years.
200 SKEETERS ORDERED
In the navy department Secretary
Daniels announced that contracts for
approximately 200 submarine chasers
or coast patrol boats had been let and
additional contracts were being signed
each day. Preparations to take into
the sen ice a huge fleet 'of small motor
craft also are being completed.
Mr. Daniels conferred today with
Captin Wilson, chief of the entire pa
trol service on the Atlantic seaboard.
Conferences also were held with the
engineering experts of the department
as to the possibility of Increasing the
number of 110 fribt patrol craft to be
ordered. The department will order
all that can be built.
Army Plan Develops
The scope of the. war department's
army plan is gradually becoming clear
although the details are being with
held until they are sent to congress.
Included in the scheme must be the
funds and equipment necessary to es
tablish artillery training on a basis
never before attempted In the United
States. Warfare has changed In the
European struggle. Mimic trench war-'
fare must replace much of the old
open order skirmish drill, supplement
ed with hard marching and vigorous
physical exercises to harden the men
as quickly as possible.
Boys of 20 to 30 First
There are many indications that 11
is proposed to build up a fighting ma
chine composed exclusively of men in
their twenties and each man free from
home responsibilities or cares that
might embarrass his soldierly quality.
A perfect military weapon is to be
fashioned, 'officers say. if the army's
plan is accepted by congress. It will
take time and money but will furnish
such a force as will make its weight
felt against any troops in the world.
High Standards Kept
Presumably the oldest men within
the prescribed limits would be called
out first. These classes would yield
the smallest number of training, for
the percentage of men to assume fam
ily responsibility goes up rapidly after
twenty years Is reached. They would
be- however, men In their most vigor,
mis years ready for any hardship. Each

The properties this company will take over and own a: j known as the Alhambra Silver Mines of the Alham-bra-Black

The Alhambra mine has produced more than $300,000 in Silver its ores are chiefly native silver and niccolite
carrying from 300 to 2,000 uz. silver per ton. "It is reliably stated," says Albert A. Leach, Chief Geologist of the
Burro Mountain Copper Co., (Phelps Dodge), that the niccolite ore streak is from 2 1-2 to 3 feet in width. The
whole vein matter carries from 10 to 50 oz. silver per ton, but the pay streak is from 8 to 24 inches in width and assays
from 400 to 6,000 oz. silver per ton."
The ores are identical with those of Cybalt, Ont., and are the only important deposits of this type known of in
the United States. V. Geo. Waring, E. M., in his report on this property says: "There is no doubt but that the Al
hambra lode is of extreme permanence its richness cannot be doubted by any one who examines the mine it is really
unique and camparahle with only one or two of the most remarkable mines that have ever been known in the history
of Silver Mines."

lation, as if there were some magic in the name, and pub
lic men are often criticised by an unthinking press be
cause their names are not identified with the enactment
ot some new law. There could not be a greater fallacy.
To prevent enactment of new laws may be a legislat
or's highest merit, and to encourage legislation may be a
grievous fault. In the majority of cases, "constructive
legislation," as it is called in the prevailing phrase of j
cant, is a delusion and a fraud.
j In a great and growing country such as ours, with con-
tinual rapid changes going on, of course we cannot get
along without new laws,, but in ordinary times "con
structive" legislation, as men love to call it, is a danger
In most years we should be far better off if Congress and
our state legislature would confine themselves to the en
actment of appropriation bills and to imperative revision
' of the laws of raising revenue.
The thing the country needs today is not new laws so
much as the repeal of bad. Louis R. Coolidge in Ameri
can Industries for February. .

1 . THE MIDDLE WEST AWAKE.
From Cleveland, O., comes a declaration of principlt p
that holds no encouragement for pacificists. The Cleve
land Board of Education recently passed a set of resolu'
tions urging two kinds of preparedness for defense.
One was preparedness to fight against attack from
within crime, poverty, disease, oppression of the weak
by the strong, ignorance, dirt, etc. Sounder methods of
government, more adequate courts, police and fire depart
ments, health boards, and other agencies are the defer,
ses to be raised against such "attack from within."
Lut the Middle West does not stop there. This par
ticular group of educators and they undoubtedly rep
resent the growing sentiment of large numbers of people
of the West and Middle West recognize that "As to dan
gers from without, we must be prepared to combat not
the average but the lowest standard of international
morality existing in nations strong enough to cause ns
trouble." And so they urge "a citizenry trained to arms
and adequately equipped."
They propose to use the public schools and the com 1
pulsory education of their state to teach that "wrong,
injustice, oppression, unjust assault must be fought" and
to teach the "utter silliness of declining war if war be
necessary to overcome evil and hold up high principles
and ideals."
The people of the West and Middle West have re
sented the charges the East has made that they are
indifferent to the great ideals involved in the Europeau
war, that they are pacifists at all costs. Whatever their
real attitude may have been in the past, it is certain
that they are waking up now, that they are one in spirit
with the rest of the country in holding that "we must
stand for the rights of humanity against the lawless and
ruthless assaults of a power that seeks no justification
other than its own will." ,
120 DAYS.
Germany and Austria have two hopes left their U
boats and Mother Nature.
Tbey are near starvation. They can get the food they
need only through peace, making importations possible,
or through the new harvest at home. They are trying
to hasten peace by starving England. Unless they can
do that, tbey are thrown back on their own failing food
resources.
From the record of the U-boats so far, there is little
ground for expectation that England will be forced to
yield. At the rate of destruction so far established in the
new, unlimited sea warfare, it would take from one to
two years to make England feel the hunger that Ger
many and Austria feel today.
That throws the Central Powers back on Mother Na
ture or perhaps we should say, on Providence. Their
armies, though weakened, may hold back the surround
ing sea of enemies for a long time yet, if they can renew
their stock of food.
Ar.Hyarian statesman announced recently, "We must
hold out 120 days longer." It would take that long for
the new crops Germany and Austria are pretty fa;
north, ami spring comes late. They can probably endure
for that period.
But suppose tlie harvests fail! Everything hangs .on
that. They are making tremendous efforts. But with
seed scarce, with fertilizer almost impossible to obtaiu,
with the heavy- work of cultivation mostly in the hands
of ill-nourished women, children and old men, with farm
machinery wearing out, it would be strange if the crops
wtre anyw.'iere near normal. And there is always the
possibility of the unexpected of heat, drought, blight,
pests and what not.
There will Ik- harvests of some sort, of course, and
then the hunger will be relieved at leant temporarily.
But if the crops arc not sufficient to carry them tbroug'i
another year, the reckoning will be at hand. Unless
there should be wholly unexpected German military suc
cesses, bad harvests would in all probability drive the
Central Empires to sue for peace before next fall.
THE BURDEN OF USELESS LAWS.

ive merit in terms of multitudinous bill and laws? Kol

A GENEROUS LOAN.
When American bankers are being criticised and per
haps justly for their grasping war-loan policy, it is
pleasant to record a generous and patriotic act on th:
part of our foremost banker.
A representative of the Chamber of Commerce of the
United States went to the firm of J. P. Morgan & Co
and said: "I have come to borrow $1,000,000 without
interest for an indefinite term upon security that is le
tjally no good." And he got it.
The money was for the United States government. U
was needed to pay for army supplies. The war depart
ment had run out cf funds cn March 6, because Congress
at the close of the last session had neglected to pass the
srmy deficiency bill. . Contractors refused to deliver more
supplies unless they were paid for in cash or in vouchers
as good as cash. The matter was'put up to Mr. Morgan,
and in twenty minutes he consented to let the govern
ment have the $1,000,000 without interest or security
md promised to assume personally whatever loss there
might be.
Of course Mr. Morgan will get back his million. Prob
ably .he will get interest on it,, too. Uncle Sam is neither
a cheat nor a miser. But Mr. Morgan deserves none the
'ess praise for his generosity.
His action is in harmony with the new spirit of unsel
fish co-operation with the government shown lately by
our big business interests in general.
But what shall we say of a Congress that made such a
deed necessary by its failure to provide for army needs
in so critical and perilous a time?

FRIG HTFULN ESS ON LAND.
There, have been many attempts to explain the appar- .
rently senseless devastation that has marked the re- j
Teat of the Germans from their old battle front in north
rn France. Most of it appears to have Jiad no conceiv
able military object. Some commentators have insisted j
hat the Germans destroyed the houses, furniture, fruit
trees, etc., from sheer love of destruction that after two j
nd a half years of ruthless warfare they have developed
. perverted pleasure in vandalism. But a more plausible .
?xplanation is offered by Major General Maurice, chief
lirector of operations in the British war office. He sees .
a "political object." '
He suggests that the German war office sought to make j
a horrible example of the relinquished territory, for the
sake of forcing France to make peace.
"The rench people so the Germans are supposed to
" ave reasoned will see what sort of a 'redeemed France'
hey will have if tbey persist in trying to drive us out ,
.'hey will understand that, if we are obliged to wit'u-
-aw from all the conquered territory, we will leave every
Jiile cf it just such a desolate and worthless ruin. So
fiey will give up. Then we can deal with the British."
But from all appearances, this "frightfulness" against
.'rightfulness against the British by sea The pillage and
andalism merely enrage the French and spur them to
stronger efforts against the inviders. Which is precisely

Phoenix after visiting the First Ari

there are a number of officers and
men in the regiment of German des
cent, but all are champing at their
bits for a whack at America's enemy.
One lieutenant, who was educated in
the Fatherland, is expecially emphatic
in his demand to be sent to France to
aid in whipping the Germans.

confesses, "I have wanted to lick a

THOUSAND-DOLLAR MEALS.
The cost-o'-living climax seems to have been readied
uy half a dozen Philadelphia men who dined together re-
.ently at one of the city hotels. Their meal cost them
$1,000 a plate.
Just what they ate is unfortunately not recorded. Pre
sumably It wasn't corn meal mush, nor brown rice, nor
"cheaper cuts." Anybody ought to be able to get a pretty ,
satisfactory layout for $1,000, even if his taste runs to ter
rapin and rare vintages. But from such details as have
been permitted to reach the vulgar public, the true in- j
wardness of the dinner consisted rather in its accessories ;
than in the food provided. j
After all, a man can eat only about so much, and driuk
only about so much; and whether it's bam an' eggs or
humming birds' tongues, last year's cider or last cen
tury's Burgundy, it would take a valiant trencherman to
get away with a thousand dollars' worth. When, how
ever, the feast is "spread in a room transformed luto a
woodland dell", with a "canopy of dogwood in blooui"
with "real apple blossoms" and rare plants contributing
to the "springtime atmosphere" aud this iu wintry
March of course the meal can run into quite a bit of
money.
.The thousand-dollar guests, strauge to say. are des
criltcd not as munition millionaires, but as "men inter
ested In things historic aud literary." Surely men inter
ested in such luatters ought to know that each of those
"plates" would hac sufficed to support an average Amer
ican workman's laiuily for more than a year. Also that
it's a mighty poor time in the world's history for any
man. epeeially an Anieri an. to stoop to such luxury.

DORFINGER BUILDING
TO BE CONDEMNED
'lire and Building Committee
Decides Structure Cannot Be
; Repaired for Ten l'cr Cent
Or Less of Its Valuation.
The Dorfinger building will not be
repaired, if the city council has its
'way, and the law says lias. Afte,
the city fire anu builaing committee
had made a thorough ea.u-iia;:on 01
the fire-damaged structure yesterday,
it was decided that it would be impos
sible to repair the building at an ex
pense not exceeding ten per cent of
its' valuation. James Henderson, lo
cal contractor, examined the building
for the city and estuue-.ed that it
wrtild be impossible to re;;ar :.. ro"
much less than $445. Mr. Henderson,
in estimating the value of the build
ing, placed its original value of ?4.
700 and allowed three per cent Tor ap
preciation for each of the twelve
years it has been standing, bringing
the present value in the neighborhood
of $2800, and making the cost of re
pair far in excess of ten per cent.
, Action to condemn the building will
probably be taken at a special meet
ing of the c'oiincil tomorrow nieht. Mr.
Henderson also examined the Hughes

SCHOOL AT FORREST
DESTROYED BY FIRE
I When Miss Ruth Stewart, teacher at
Uie Forrest Station school, ten miles
west ot Douglas, went to school this
m'jrning sue found everything all
right, except that the school house
wasn't tiieree. It had burned up, or
:down. during the night, and only a
. pile of ashes marked the site ot the
former temple of knowledge.
Just how the schoolhouse caught
fire or at what hour it burned has
not been learned, and probably nevtr
will be. It is the belief ot some l
the residents of the section thai the
fire was of incendiary origin, though
what could have been the object ot
the perpetrator is not known. The
nearest building to the school house
is the section house, about 5(0 feet
away, but the occupants did trot sec
or hear the lire.
The school house consisted of one
of the larger portable buildings in use
last year in Douglas and was moved
to Forrest only last September. The
building and contents were alued at
several hundred tloWars, with no in
surance. The enrollment was approx
imately 33, all the children being of
Mexican parentage except half a

Anti-American Talk
Senator Lafollette said the United
States has not the confidence of the
other American republics because of
its war policies.
Referring to the President's asser-
:ion that the German people were !
thrown into the war w ithout an on- i
portunity to say anything about it, '
the senator asked:
"W ill the supporters of this war
bill have a vote on it before it goes
into effect? Unless they do that it
ill-becomes us to speak of Germany.
Submit the quest inn to the people. By
a vote of 10 to 1 they would register
their declaration against war."

British mine field blockade was the
administration's great mistake," the
senator said, "and the real and pri
mary cause of an American war dec
laration." Blood on Our Hands?
"We have wallowed in the mire at
months for this government to pro
test. In principle, therefore, Germa
ny had the right blindly to destroy
ships by submarines and mines in her
own blockade zone. Germany is do
ing only what Kngland Is doing."
Williams Replies
When Senator Lafollette concluded
he had been speaking more than
three hours. Senator Williams of
Mississippi arose immediately to re
ply. "The speech of the Wisconsin
senator would better have become
Herr von Bethman Hollweg than
an American senator," said Senator-Williams.
"In fact he has gone
further than Herr von Bethmann
Hollpveg would ever have gone.
Bethmann-Hollweg said the use of
submarines could be justified only
on the ground of necessity. The
senator from Wisconsin puts it on
the same footing as Great Brit
ain's interference with our com
merce. "I fully expected the senator
from Wisconsin before he took his
seat to defend the invasion of Bel
gium, the most barbarous act
ever committed. I heard from
him a speech that was pro-German,
pro-Goth, pro-vandal, and
which was anti-President, antl
congrnss and anti-American.
WHICH COMES FIRST, BOB?
"While pronouncing an eulogy
on German people he might have
eulogized a very much greater,
better and more intelligent peo
ple the American people.
"His speech was exactly what
might have been delivered in the
German reichstag by Bethmann
Hollweg, . if . Bethmann-Hollweg
had the audacity. But Bethmann
Hollweg had too much sense, too
much knowledge to make that
speech."
At this point Senator Lafollette left
the chamber but remained in the !
cloak room awhile, within hearing
distance.
Remember U. S. Victims
Continuing. Senator Williams said
he heard in imagination the groans
of men, women and children sent to
watery graves by German submarines
"But the senator from Wiscon
sin hears none of them," said the
Mississippi senator. "I have
loved the Wisconsin senator in
a way, until recently, but I have
no patience with any man who
stands up in the senate at this
time applauding the common ene
my who also is the enemy of the
human race, and has not one
word in praise of the American
1 President or the American people.
' "If the American people cau't be

sires. We are involved in this

"The Wisconsin senator labored

Repudiates Lafollette
Senator Husting. Senator LafoKete
Wisconsin colleague, said that while
every man should have a mind of hi
own and speak on his own conviction,
in times of this kind, the conduct of
international affairs must be in the
hands of one man. He said fce be
lieved that if the question "of peace
or war" only were submitted to the
people it would be voted down.
"That." he added, "is not the ques
tion here. The question is. shall th
people of the United States support
the President and congress of the Un
ited States in whatever course they
deem wisest and safest. I want to
say that if that question were sub
mitted to the people they would sus
tain the President and congress over
whelmingly. "I wish I could vote against war.
It would ease my mini .ind couscienr-e
to vote axainst any war. but the ques
tion is not whether we want war. it
is whether or not we are in war."
As to the "Hyphenate
Referring to "hyphenates" activi
ties. Senator Husting said:
"Societies and leagues have been
formed to exalt everything that is
German and denounce everything Am
erican. We find newspapers denounc
ing the Presid"ut. There is nothing
too infamous for them to say. It also
has been talked in the shops and on
the farms. Everything Germany has
done.-no matter how infamous, has
been exalted."

out for training probably would have
reached the same stage of physical de
velopment by the time the training
had been given. Physical standards
of the regular army will be rigidly
maintained.
REGISTER ALL BACHELORS
Registration of all single men
between the fixed ages will be a
big task. Co-operation of state
and municipal authorities may be
sought
Several million men must be en
rolled and examined physically be
fore the process of selection could
be applied. Probably worker of
certain classes whose labor m vi
tal to the maintenance of the food
and war supplies of the nation will
be exempted as a class.
VOLUNTEER FORCE TABOO
Army officers indicated today that
the government's p'jliey leaves no
place for volunteer forces. They are
prepared also to urge against any pre
mature effort to send an army abroad
to fight. To be of any aid in the world
struggle, they say, only the very ade
quate independent and highly equipped
and organized troops, with adequate
independent supply lines, should go to
Eui'jpe. To do otherwise, one officer
declared, might make American troops
a menace rather than an aid to the
entente. It would further tax the al
ready heavily strained French and
British supply systems.
The council of national defense and
its advisory commission will meet
again tomorrow in joint session. The
commissioners are toiling night and
day to make ready in every way for
the activities that willrtme quickly
on the heels of the adoption of the war
resolution.

CHICAGO. April 4. Wool dealers
of Chicago to'day agreed to follow the
action of dealers in Boston, St. Louis
and other cities and place at the dis
posal of the government all wool at
prices current on April 2 and 3
It was decided that the dealers
would neither buy nor sell any wool
for ten days, or any other period set
by a committee of five appointed at
the meeting to cooperate with the
proper authorities in handling the
raw wool supply.
Mn conversant with the wool
trade said the organized dealers had
decided to act for fear any misman
agement of independent dealers might
cause the government to seize the en
tire wool output for war use.

In London, for Benefit of Na

' circles would welcome Brazil as an
ally of the entente, considering her
the most important neutral after Am

ers have mre opportunity than any
where else for interfering with food
supplies for Europe. At present the
allied warships have to contend with
the difficulties of coaling at sea.
Cuba is also considered important as
affording submarine bases.
According to information here Ger
mans are flocking to Mexico fi'ora
South America, having taken with
them considerable quantities of arms
and ammunition.
