AMERICAN
L
ATTUGSOW
Enthusiastic Meeting Held Last Night, 75 Ex-Service Men
Present Fifty Delegates From Bisbee Plan for Trip
Cochise Delegates to Vote for Sgt. "Andy" Martin for State
v President; Plan to Bring Next Convention to Cochise County
- Strong by reason of the diversity of
Its political faiths, social, intellectual
and industrial standards, the America
nn Legion is bound to become more
than the G. A. K. and the U. S. W. V.,
a real moral force ia American life,
We felicitate Prescott for having
formed the second post in this Btate.
Rightly directed and it seems that
Its leaders are rightly directing it
the Legion will bring to America a
new spirit, preserved from the stress
and strains of war, for the very neces
sary pursuits of peace. As Mr. Con
way, the Arizona chief said here
this week, the Legion has a purpose
other than the shaking of hands and
the "fanning" of war experiences.
If numbers alone constituted its
Btrength, the Legion soon would be
the strongest factor in our national
existence. But it has something more
than mere numerical strength. There
is a companionship cf purpose among
men who have gone through what
the Legionaries have suffered, that
will bind them as no other force could.
There is no such appeal as they must
sense, to be found in the rituals of
church or lodgf'. Brotherhood A
word that Is s sadly overworked inj
fraternities -ir,d' trade nnt.-ins. wi'J
mean something more than a cornmoh
selfish tie.
With all Its altrusitic beginnings,
the Legion must have much practical
method in its organization, for it has
been more practically safeguarded
against the urge of selfishness and
demigod appeal than any previous
similar association.
The American people, too Indulgent,
too indifferent to the merits of its
leaders, and to their morals, needs,
some new force that will prevent men
like Debs, La Follette and Victor
Berger to attain the . positions they
have.
The hotels of Tucson have made
special rates to all men who are in1
attendance at the convention. The
railroads have made special fare con-;
cessions and it now remains only for
the local business men to put their
shoulder to the wheel and make Bis-,
bee-Warren district a live factor in
the convention, by not only allowing
their men time off, but also by urg
ing them to attend where necessary.
If Bisbee or some other city in Coe
chise county can secure the
next American Legion convention It
will be a means of advertising that can
rot be duplicated.
COCHISE TO SUPPORT MARTIN
Several resolutions were passed at
the meetfng last evening among
which was one supporting ,Aady Mar
tin of Tucson a prominent druggist
of the city for the presidency of, the
Legion. Mr. Martin is well known
, to many of the Bisbee boys, having
served as "top-cutter" of his battery
and is known as a man well qualified
to fill the position of state president.
Cochise county delegates will go on
record along with the Tuscon aud
Phoenix delegates who have already
pledged their support and it Is hope
to put Martin over for the presidency
before the convention cIosm.
Legion an Enlisted Man's Affair .
Several delegates present last
night discussed the merits of Mr. Mar
tin. All are united on the fact that
he would be the right man for the
place.
"Mike" Cassidy pointed out during
the discussion last evening that the
election of Mr. Martin would not only
"put the right man in the right place"
but would do much to allay any
feeling which might exist at the com
vention that the American Legion
both in the state convention as well
as the National convention was "not
controlled by officers." Only 180,000
officers if they all are active would
vote irl the National convention of the
Legion, and when it is taken into con
sideration that there are over 5,000
000,000 enlisted men who are the
bac kbone of the Legion
Continuing Mr. Cassidy said: "Re-
member that no member of the legion
has more than one vote when the
commander in chief of the American
armies returns and joins the legion
he has no more say as far as the bal
lot box is concerned than the most
lowly buck private of the A. E. F.
These five million men of the enlist
ed personnel control absolutely the
destinies of the American Legion,
both in our state conventions and the
national convention, and that is why
I sincerely recommend a man of
"Andy" Martins lype to lead the Ari
zona Stale convention and it is hoped
EGlONCONvENT ON
SPECIAL CAR rHOMHERE
that the Cochise county delegates vot
ing strength when added to the coun
: ties already pledged to his support
j will be the deciding factor. He has
Drains ana aoiiuy, ana is not looKing
for a political job of any kind." Mr.
Cassidy s talk was received with en
thusiasm by those present, as it
brought forth the oft discussed ques
tion concerning which there has been
considerable misinformation. The
clear-cut analysis and force of Mr.
Cassidy's figures convinced all those
present that the bugaboo that the fu
ture destiny and policies of the
American Legion either in the state
or national convention being con
trolled either directly or indirectly by
officers is a farce.
In this issue of tha Review there Is
an article telling in detail the plans
by which Sgt. Andy Martin will be
"put over" at the convention.
SERGEANT ANDREW P.
MARTIN TO BE SUPPORTED
FOR LEGION'S HEAD
(Tucson Citizen)
PHOENIX July 7. Maricopa
county's delegation, 22 strong, is com
ing to the state convention of the
American Legion which opens at Tuc
son on Kriuay oftnis'week. pledged
as a unit to support Sergeant Andrew
P. Martin, former state senator from
Pima county, for the honor of head
ing the organization in Arizona. This
assures the Pima county man of the
nucleus of a strong support on the
floor of the convention, for with the
Maricopa and Pima delegations be
hind him he will have 30 votes out
of the 103 to be cast from the very
start. Other counties are expected by
the Maricopa delegation to throw their
strength to the Pima county man.
Issuance of the official call for the
convention by Secretary Fred Blair
Townsend of the temporary organiza
tion of the American Legion brought
few surprises. As had been predicted
the number of delegates to which
each county is entitled is based on
the number allotted each county in
the draft quota; one delegate being
chosen for each 100 men in the draft
quota. On that basis of selection, pre
liminary estimates worked out by
members of Frank Luke post here are
not far from correct. The official
quotas as 1 furnished by Secretary
Townsend today are as follows :
Apache. 8; Cochise, 19; Coconino,
12, Gila, 13; Graham, 3; Greenlee 5;
Maricopa 22; Mohave, 3; Pima, 8; Pi
nal, 3; Santa Cruz 2; Yavapai, 13;
and Yuma, 5. The fact that the num
ber of delegates Is limited to 103, how
ever, is not meant to limit the num
ber of service men attending the con
vention. Townsend makes this clear
in his letter of notification. He
states that it is desired that every
service man possible attend the con
vention. All service men present will
be accorded the privileges of the floor
for debate and discussion. Voting
powers, however, will be limited to
delegates only, and the unit system of
voting will prevail In the conven
tion. The method of selecting the dele
gates to the convention Is left to
each county, but Secretary Townsend
suggests that some meeting be called
in the limited time left, in order that
delegates' may be chosen and creden
tials furnished them. Properly ac
credited delegates together with
members of their families are to be
given special rates of one and a third
fares to the Tucson convention. They
will be obliged to pay the full fare to
Tucson, and should take a receipt
from the ticket agent, showing the
amount paid. Vouchers will be furn
ished by the state secretary, at the
convention, and upon presentation of
same to the ticket agent at Tucson,
return tickets will be sold at one
third fare.
Announcement has been made by
Townsend that reduced rates have
been made by Tucson hotels for the
convention, so that room accommoda
tions can be obtained by any service
man for a minimum price of $1. Mem
bers of Maricopa county's delegation
to the convention will be selected to
night, it was announced today.

Non-Partisan League
Heads Are on Trial
For Seditious Speech
JACKSON. Minn.. July 7. Joseph Gil
bert, former non-partisan league organ
izntion manager and co-defendant with
President A. C. Townley, testified in dis
trict court here this afternoon that he
never conferred with Townley regarding
the speech which Gilbert made at Ken
yon in 1917 and at Lake Cloud In 191S
and that Townley never conferred with
him concerning addresses which Town-
ley made during the war.
Townley and Gilbert are on trial
charged with conspiracy to foster disloy
alty by means of public speeches and
literature.
Much of Gilbert's testimony concerned
the speeches he made at lakefield, Jan
urya 23, 1918. He was arrested while
making this speech. The Indictment
charges that Gilbert, In this address de
clared: "Your boys are better off on the
farms than In the trenches. 5000 miles
away. "Who will feed these boys when
they are in the trenches 5000 miles
away?"
Gilbert testified today that he said:
"Why. the boys on the farms are render
ing Just as valuable service toward win
ning the war as the boys in the
trenches."
"I also said who would feed the boys
in the trenches If all would be at the
front." Gilbert added.
Gilliert denied that he said In a speech
at Kenyon, August 17, 1917:
"We were stampeded Into this war by
newspaper rot to pull England's chest
nuts out of the fire."
FLAYS LEAGUE
-OF NATIONS
PROVIDENCE, RL, July 7. Senator
Hiram W. JohnBon of California,
speaking tonight, declared the pro
posed League of Nations was not in
reality an association to prevent war
but "a league of armed nations in a
gigantic war trust.
"In its very creation," he added, "it
has been stripped of every idealistic
purpose it ever had. It contains with
in itself the element of many wars,
and worse than Jhat, It rivets as in
the Shantung decision, the chains of
tyranny upon millions of people and
cements for all time unjust and wick
ed annexations. .
"This League of Nations, with the
men who really wrote It, was meant
to obtain peace only insofar as peace
maintained forever inviolate their ter
ritories and their subject peoples: and
It was meant that this kind of peace
should be obtained by the exercise of
the power and the force of the Unit
ed States.
Summing tip his arraignments of
the league covenant, the senator said:
"It means that I must abandon the
lessons of my youth, which until this
moment have been the creed of my
manhood of American ideals and
American patriotism; that I must
deny Americanism I taught my chil
dren and that under God's blessing I
hope to teach my grandchildren. It
means the halting and betrayal of
New World liberalism, the triumph of
cynical Old World diplomacy, the hu
militation and end of American ideal
ism. The Issue is Americanism, and
I am an American."

SAN FRANCISCO, July 7. The
San Francisco Bulletin prints today
a Washington dispatch quoting J. B.
Densmore, director general of the fed
eral employment service as denying
responsibility of the employment ser
vice or of himself for any investiga
tion made in San Francisco of the

trict attorney and others connected
with the prosecution of Thomas J.
Mooney.
' Densmore said the investigation
was made by agents of the department
of laboi- who had worked with him
in collecting evidence in, cases invol
ving Chinese immigration. These in
spectors, he said, "discovered an op
portunity to present further evidence
to the secretary of labor on the sub
ject of the fairness of the trial of
Thomas J. Mooney, by the
state's attorney for San Francisco,
which subject has been gone into toy
the commission appointed by the
president, of which the secretary of
labor was chairman."
in his absence, Densmore said, the
inspectors were authorized to continue
the Fickert investigation in connec
tion . with - their other work.
"Unfortunately," Densmore adds.
some of this report fell into the hands
of the publisher of a local paper, who
published it without any authority

LIBEL CASE
MOUNT CLEMENS, Mich., July 7.-.
Defending the Chicago Tribune
against charges of pro-German mo
tives made by the plaintiffs council
opening the case. Tiffany Blake,
chief editorial writer for the news
paper occupied the witness stand in
the Henry Ford-Chicago Tribune IU
bel suit in today's session of court.
Mr. Blake declared the policy ot
the Tribuna was strictly American
ism and that the ;ed1torfal which
called Mr. Ford "an archist" was pub
lished in support of the government
and "to offset the influence of Mr.
Ford's pacifist utterances."
The Tribune, Mr.- Blake said, had
differed with president Wilson and
with many Americans on the sub
marine issue until after the sinking
of the Lusitania and the entrance ol
the United States into the war.
Mr. Flake outlined other points of
the newspapers policy as denying the
right of sinking unarmed merchant
men without visit and search; op
posing the carrying of munitions on
passenger boats; opposing the carry
ing of passengers on boats with mu
nitions aboard, and imposing an em
bargo on shipment of supplies to any
belligerent nation.
Immediately following the sinking
of the Lusitania, the witness said,
the Tribune believed war logical, but
after the series of notes between this
government and , Germany it couid
not see its way clear to plunge the
country into war. At all times, how
ever, he declared, the newspaper an
nounced It intention; to stand
squarely behind the ' president In
whatever action he took.
Attorney Weymouth Kirkland, of
council for the Tribune, asked the
witness what the nation's interests
the newspaper considered paramount
in its editorial discussions. I
''Those of the United States, first.
last and all the time," Mr. ; Blake
replied. "That is the test we wish
applied to our utterances at any
stage of the world war."

Agreement Means Immediate
Guarantee Against Any
Desire for Non-Aggression
PARIS, July 7. (French Vireless
Bervice) The Petit Parisien explain
ing the agreement entered into by
the United States and Great Britian to
come to the aid of France in case
of unprovoked aggression, by Germa
ny says:
"For the first time a convention of
this ki'id is made public directly af
ter its conclusion. This may be cal
led an act of diplomacy, accompanied
in the face of the whole world, one
all the more decisive for not being
kept secret in the chancellories. The
circumstances relative to its conclu
sion are known.
"The League of Nations can not op
erate Immediately. Years may go be
fore it really comes into force, and
in the meantime France may again be
the victim of aggression. .The danger
of aggression menaces France more
than any other country which is a
member of the League, America being
far away, and England more than ever
protected by the sea.
"Mr. Wilson and Mr. Lloyd George
realized that France needed an im
mediate guarantee, the simple procla
mation would keep in check any de
sire for aggression. The agreement
published answeres the purpose;
will come Into force if any unprovoked
attack is made. The allies of France
have bound themselves by the guar
antees that they deemed necessary.
Finally the treaty will remain in force
until the League of Nations decides
that the League itself is a sufficient
guarantee against aggresscion. Such
is the meaning of this unprecedented
agreement. It will not be possible to
misconstrue it."

Additional Suits
Deportation Cases
To Be Filed Today
Between 75 and 100 complaints
against people of Cochise county who
participated in the deportation of
more than 1100 alleged I. W. W..s and
their sympathizers July 12, 1917,
charging them with kidnapping, will
be filed Tuesday before Judge Joseph
L. Winters of Lowell, a 'suburb of
Bisbee. This was the statement made
tonight in Tombstone by Robert N.
French, county attorney of Cochise
ocunty, who has prepared the charges.
Under the Arizona law indictment
by Grand Jury is not necesasry in
filing criminal complaints, and infor
mation filed by the county attorney
before a justice of the peace or the
superior court being sufficient.
Mr. French refuses to state how
many complaints he would file alto
gether. He said, however, that there
would be others than the number
filed today, and these would be pre
pared and filed as rapidly as possible.
Joseph L. Winters, the Justice ot
the tjeace before whom Mr. French
proposes to file the cases, is a prac
ticing attorney, and recently filed
31 additional suits for damage against
the El Paso and Southwestern rail
road company, the Phelps Dodge Mer
cantile company, Phelps Dodge Cor
opration, C. & A. Mining company,
Shattuck Mining company, M. Cun
inngham, H. C. Wheeler, Charles W.
Allen, James R. Henderson, Ben
Frankenberg, Sam Frankenberg, Mose
Newman, G. H. Dowell, Arthur Not
nian, Lem Shattuck, J. S. Curry, F. B.
King, N. C. Bledsoe, and J. C. Green
way, in behalf of men alleging that
they were deported on July 12, 1917.
Each plaintiff asked $5,000 .damages.
When questioned as to whether the
fact that Judge Winters was acting as
council for the plaintiffs in civil ac
tions against some of the men who
probably would be arrested, would
prejudice the county against him as a
presiding magistrate in the proposed
criminal actions, Mr. French replied
that it would not. The county, he
said, was satisfied with Justice Win
ters as a magistrate, but should any
of the defendants offer objections
they might obtain a change of venue.
RAINS PAH L

YZE DIRIGIB
SOUTH 0ES0N0RA TIP
NOGALES, July 7 Heavy rains in
the state of Sonora and Sinaloa Mex
ico, virtually have paralyzed traffic
over the Southern Pacific de Mexico
railroad south of Empalme. Sonora.
About 400 carlods of garbanzos, or
chick peas, destined for importation
into the United States at. this point
are held back as a consequence.
The Fuerte river, raised to an un
usual height by the rain, has washed
out a railroad bridge at San Bias.
There has been no freight from Sin-
alola received here in fifteen days.
Railroad officials think they may be
able to operate that section of the
Southern Pacific de Mexico between
Empalme, near Guaymas, and Nav
ajoa, not far suoth of here, tomorrow,
and carry passengers in the usual
way, except for transport across the
Fuerte by ferry, within four days.
The Cananea branch of the raidroad
tied up by washouts since Saturday,
was reopened today.

MINEOLA. N. Y., July 7. The re
turn cruise ot the British dirigibie
R-34 across the Atlantic will not start
until after dawn Wednesday. The
proposed plan to get the airship
away at five a. m. on Tuesday wa3
abandoned tonight owing to reports of
adverse weather ' conditions, which
will make the dirigible's crew doubt
ful. Without overhauling the engines
it would be impractical for the airship
to take off on her venture, as quan
tities of carbon accumulated in the
engines during the 108 hours in which
the craft was aloft on the unprece
dented journey which ended at Roos
evelt Field here on Sunday morning.
Tonight tbe R-34 swung at ease above
this flying ground, her graceful hulk
scarcely moving in the gentle breeze,
illuminated by great searchlights
which made her visible to thousands
of spectators who had come here in
motor cars, trains, and on foot to
watch the early leaving.

RICHARD BALLAS
In the Wallace Real Estate Office, No. 7 Main Sireet
LONDON, July 7. Strong opposi
tion continues to develop against the
proposition of trying the former Ger
man emperor in London, or trying
him at all. Paris dispatches say that
America and Japan are opposed to the
trial and that Italy is lukewarm ap
parently have had an effect on senti
ment here.
Liberal newspapers such as the
Manchester Guardian, me Westminis
ter Gazette and the Daily News are
leading the way, with a part of the
conservative press taking the same
view, that it would tend to make the
kaiser a martyr among the Germans
prolong the passions of war and up
set the life in London. It is also
said that the former emperor's ar
rival . here might ause unpleasant
incidents. '
The Evening Standard, conserva
tive, opposes the plan because "there
are practical difficulties in arranging
the quarters for the prisoners and the
place of trial, and there is an un
pleasant suggestion of pageantry in
the project. If there must be a state
trial it should not take place in Lon
don or any other business center.
The Westminister Gazette is one o
those holding that the best puaish
ment for the ex-emperor is to leave
him in obscurity and the Times gives
prominence to a letter from Sir Val
entine Chirol, its foreign editor, ex
pressing the fear that the trial might
create a "Hohenzollern legend like
the Napoleonic legend and bring upon
Great Britian odium in Germany and
in some neutral and if the prosecu
tion should fail, it would mean ridi
cule." ',
The trial of some minor offenders
are expected to begin in August.
These will include commanders of
violations of naval warfare by the
operation of submarines, those who
ordered the bombardment of open
towns and officers of prison camps
who mistreated captives in .their
charge. 5

RAN FRANCISCO, July 7. The
coming of the Pacific fleet Is hailed
wun pleasure throughout the coast
as the harbinger of many changes.
economic and otherwise. The deci
sion of the United States navy de
partment to maintain two equal
rieets means that . approximately
200 vesls of all sizes will compose
the Pacific fleet, with a personnel ot
L'a.ooo men.
While no accurate figures are ob
tainable, it is pointed out that the
money spent at Pacific ports for the
maintenance or these ships and men
will amount to millions a week, and
the resultant return to the various in.
dustries which will contribute to this
maintenance will be no inconsider
able sum. Scarcely any kind of a
selling concern will be overlooked
from the coal yard to the fruiter.
Further than this, thousands of
sailors will be on liberty practically
at an times, while the ships are in
port, and this means that the email
shop keepers, will participate in the
inousanas or dollars spent in neces
sities, as well as in the many little
luxuries which are the delight of the
saiior.
Aside from the personnal of the
navy, many of the families of both of
ficers and men undoubtedly n.-ni
move to the Pacific coast so as to be
near their sons, husbands and fathers
and this means the addition of many
more persons who Mill have to be
catered to.

LET'S THANK GOD FOR THE MEN WHO
SEE THROUGH THE SHAMS OF LIFE
BY THE REVEREND CHARLES STELZLE
Staft Writer on Religious Topics
JEREMIAH has been called "the weeping prophet" because he
:ontinued to point uot the low moral conditions of the people,
prophesying calamity, even though their religious ceremonies
probably eclisped everything that ever had taken place in all
their history.
He became impatient when they reminded him o their ecclesiastl
cla observance which were mere sham he said, and they in turn
hated him and shut him up because he became so insistent in his
denunciations.
But Jeremiah was in the position that at least some prophets
of today find themselves they are ostracised because they will not
accept the philosophy that "airs well with the world." They can
not see that the world is safe when we're in the throes of a great
moral and ethical conflict.
They find themselves unable to go with the crowd that cries
"Peace, peace," when there is no peace the crowd that wants peace
at any price just so that they will be comfortable and remain un
disturbed. It isn't very popular to be a Jeremiah but it's worse to see your
people go down to defeat as Jeremiah did, because they would not
listen to him.
It requires courage to sound the warning note when everything
seems prosperous and jubilant but let's thank God for the men who
see through the shame of life and who can point us to the road that
leads to safety, even though that road must be traveled in repentance
and tears that blind the eyes but which illuminate the heart.
HERE'S A SENSIBLE DOC
THE tired business man has finally received a square deal. A
worthy and, evidently, highly intelligent M. D. in a recent
medical magazine "leader" asserts that business men should
not take violent physical exercise after a hard day In the
office. ) i f
They should not golf, and do gymnastic stunts, and endeavor, to
banish the waist line with Grecian bends.
Instead they should take it easy, compose their souls in a soft
chair, relax; that's the word, relax.
Fine business, and thank you doc.
Instead of the wife hustling us into a spiketail, after a hard day
down town, and shunting us into the opera mob we will relax and,
at our ease, in slippers and smoking jacket and cosy comfort, smooth
out the wrinkles of our soul.
' No more will we delve in the garden, or mow the lawn, or clean
out the chicken coop, and lug up wood from the basement.
Believe us, esteemed sir, -we won't from this hour.
Somehow we always felt that this chaze for work was all wrong,
and that there was entirely too much exertion connected with the
chore of living, but now that scientific authority has come 'to the
rescue we will faithfully abide by the decision.
Say, doc, how would a wheel chair do in getting about the office?
Or would it be better to install a scooter system, so we could
make the long fifty-foot journey to the cashier's window on Saturday's
without danger of complete exhaustion. .
And you can be t our name is signed, from now on, with a rubber
stamp; we will not risk our cherished health by wrestling with a
fountain pen.
THE AUTO'S AFFINITY
FIRE INSURANCE actuaries nay the fire losses in America
may be reduced considerably if a means can be devised to
effect a complete separation if not a divorce from the fire
hydrant and the automobile. At present, they say, there
seems to be an affinity between the two, especially in cities. An
automobile rushes upon a fire hydrant with such fervor and smacks
it so resoundingly that the hydrant never is the same again.
All sorts of efforts have been made to restrain the auto but
without avail. In fact the records show its attentions to the hydrants
have been so persistent of late as to be serious.
Unable to got the autos to behave, the fire gentlemen, say they
see nothing to do but remove temptation from its path so they have
suggested to the authorities of various cities that some method of
concealing, fire plugs be devised. Otherwise, they declare, it may be
necessary to increase insurance rates in some districts for the
losses, owing to demoralization of fire plugs, have been too busy
to bear.

TOMORROW
AVIAN said, "I'll oil my automobile tomorrow." The next day
found the bearings burnt out which meant a heay expense
in having them replaced.
Who loiters on the way mustgay and pay dearly. 1
When you shirk your work you flirt with failure just as sure
as you flirt with death when you play marbles with dynamite.
The glory of your past, accomplishments cast no halo over the
doings of the present or the dreams of the future.
Doing nothing or putting off what you have to do will be the
undoing of your reputation for past accomplishments. '
Time is money or maiieylcss as we choose to make it.
Putting off until tomorrow is the most expensive habit you can
cultivate, even including that of driving power automobile on Fifth
Avenue.
COBWEBS
COUWEI S arc nil riKlit for a spider to galavant about on, but
they haven't much prestige in 1919 business or on the brain.
Cobwebs are a symbol of carelessness. Nothing so em
barrasses a housewife as to have her friend t'.iscover cob

Cobwebs !n business re a sign of methods and maimers of do-,

behind the times.
Cobwebs on the brain mean sluggish thinking and ideas that

WOMAN ON LONG WALK
IN SEARCH OF WORK
PHOENIX, July 5. Halted on her
walk from Phoenix to Globe in search
of work by officers who believed nor
insane for attempting the "hike" in
this weather, Mrs. G. O. Cass was ex
amined by physicians who yesterday
declared the woman sane. She was
placed in the custody of Ed White,
who will aid her in securing employ
ment in this city.
Mrs. Cass stated that her only ob
ject in going to Globe for work w.-is
that she understood the wages paid
there would warrant her in making
the journey. She said that she had
been employed in Jerome and was
fortunate in securing a ride front
the mining town to Phoenix. The
rest of the way she intended walking
unless picked up by a passing car.
She was on the Tempe-Mesa' highway
when discvered by a southside officer.
VERDE SQUAW
BEGINS OPERATIONS
JEROME, July 5. Immediately af
ter the holidays it is planned to in
augurate the development program
at the Verde Squaw mine. The dia
mond drill with which the property
will be explored is expected to arrive
at Clarkdale tomorrow. The equip
ment will be hauled directly to the
mine and set up with the least pos
sible delay. At the mine, all ar
rangements for the installation of the
drill has been made.
EOND AND LEASE TAKEN
ON OLD DICK STARR MINE
TUCSON, July 6. Showing that
backing can be had for prospects and
for properties, if they are priced at
tractively, it was reported Saturday
that a bond .nd lease had been taken
by Mrs. Mary Hamshire and Robert
Hook on th old Dick Starr property
six miles from Tucson, off the Mis
sion road, for $6000. There are many
hundreds of feet of old working on
the property. Hook is a practical
miner and has been recently dis
charged from the army. He has op
erated before in Patagonia with his
father.
The sale price was $100 cash, $500
every six months with royalty to ap
ply. There is no restriction as to
mining. The ore is silver and lead.
fice received word from the command-1
ing general of the southern depart-1
ment that the big truck train is en-1
route to Douglas. It is believed that I
it is a test campaign, but this is a i
supposition, as there is nothing to in
dicate whether the train and men will
remain here and become a part of
the Arizona district, or whether it is
just passing through. This line of
119 motor vehicles will stretch ,over
a long strip of road, and it is expect
ed to attract much attention along
the route, and when it arrives. It is
estimated that the personnel of the
train will consist of at least GOO men
und officers.
GOLDFIELD DAYS ARE
REPEATED AT HOLBROOK
HOLBROOK, July 6. Trouble, se
rious trouble, is brewing in the Hol
biook oil field due to the claim jump
ing tactics indulged in this week by
men alleged to represent the Wind
River Oil company.
The situation recalls the old days
of Goldfield and other western min
ing camps, when a convenient tree
was all that was needed to end the
activities of men who tried to acquire
title under color of law to ground
that had been discovered and located
by others. ,
SOMERTON ENTERTAINS

SOMERTON. July 5. Yuma coun

the occasion and did herself proud in
entertaining the vast crowd which
gathered within her gates. A program
of events was carried out that pro
vided amusement for young and old.
During the day the Yuma Indian
band gave several concerts and last
right furnished music for the dance
held in the Elliott building. A vaude
ville company from Los Angeles en
tertained the crowd on a platform
erected on Main street. Late at night
there was an elaborate fireworks dis
play. Athletic contests furnished
amusement during the day.

DOUGLAS, July 6. C. A. Marcilliat
has returned from San Francisco,
where he had been in consultation
vith the headquarters of the western
department of the K. of C. war ac
tivities work along the Mexican bor
der. The insurance comnanv which
I he represent in the east has granted
l him an extension of time to continue
welfare work during the period of de
mobilization, and as he is well ac
quainted with conditions along the
border, he will have charge of all K.
of C. activities at camps and outposts
outside of Douglas, Arizona, making
his headquarters at Camp Harry J.
Jones.
A fund of $10,000 has been set
aside for welfare work .among the
soldiers in Arizona, and Secretary
Marcilliat while in San Francisco'

at Camp Usury J. Jones, which will
include a garage, a writing room and
pool room, besides a new hardwood
floor in the dance hall. With these
imporvcmenis installed it is the inten

But a Douglas man couldn't walk
many steps without running into peo
ple from his home town, to say noth
ing of the 600 or more soldiers that
went upsfrom Camp Jones. At the
fight program last night at Warren
Douglasites were everywhere.
There was no rain in the Warren
district until after the celebration,
and most of the Douglas people got
home before it began to pour down
along the Bisbee-Douglas road, which
was aboufr 12:?0. However, a number
got caught and several cars that had
engine or tire trouble had to be
abandoned. The big army trucks had
a hard time negotiating the last leg
of the trip, and a few had to be left
on the road all night. The slippery
roads made going for them almost im
possible even with chains.
But it was a great day and every
body had a good time, and as far as
known not a single accident of any
moment occurred in the county.
20-STAND COTTON GIN
CONTRACTED AT PHOENIX
PHOENIX, July 6. The Martin Cot
ton company has let the contract to
Clinton Campbell for the erection of
a new 20-stand cotton gin on Buch
anan street, between Sixth and Sev
enth streets. The new plant will
have 22 stands of the Piatt roller
type, so that 20 of them may be kept
in constant operation. It will be ready
for operation by the middle of Sep
tember, when the ginning season
opens. - '
Charles A. Martin, a member of the
company, when interviewed at his
ranch on the Tempe road yesterday,
stated the machinery and complete
equipment for the gin had been bought
and was now in transit for Phoenix.
According to the plans, the new gin
will be the h-rgest in the Salt River
valley and will have a capacity of 60
bales daily.

Douglas people spent, the Fourth' of

a splendid time, 'particularly. ' thosu

GLENDALE'lS NATION'S
CANTALOUPE CENTER
GLEN DALE. July C. Glendale is
becoming a very busy place. Every
evening the streets are blocked with
trucks and wagon loads of canta
loupes. The number of carloads be
ing shipped is increasing each day.
On Wednesday, 65 carloads left Glen
dale, Thursday 85, Friday 94, and on
number would exceed liiO. This is
remarkable, when it is taken into
consideration that the greatest num
ber of cars shipped from Glendale last
year on any cne day was 59. The
peak of this year will probably ex
ceed 125 cars daily.
FIVE MILLION
HUSTBEVOTED
IV STATE F0I1
SOLDERS
If'l
PHOENIX, July 7. With 400 Ari
zona soldiers having signified their
desire to take up farming under the
soldiers' settlement law passed by the
last legislature, contingent on the
passage of the Lane measure by Con
gress, capitol officials are estimating
the possible cost to the State all the
way from $50,000,000 . downwards.
While a few support the higher
figures, a great number calculate the
cost to Arizona to settle her returned
lighters on farms will be much lower,
some naming $5,000,000 as a more
nearly correct figure.
The guessing commenced when the
State auditor went to the land depart
ment to learn how much money the
board of equalization should be asked
to levy to put the law into affect pro
vided the Lane program passes Con
gress. .The State law carries a
"blanket" appropriation to meet de
mands, the land department being
ramed as administrator of the State
act.
Ben Clark, deputy land commission
er; M. S. Stanley, deputy State audi
tor, and A. C. Sieboth of the tana
department held a conference on the
subject, and it was said, some startl
ing figures were arrived at.
Charles W. Howe of the State tax
commission refused to. make a state
ment, but smiled broadly at the men
tion of $50,000,000.

E. F.
Prof. H. E. Ross of the Lowell, Jr.,
High school is conducting classes in
naturalization for the aliens in this
district at the Y. M. C. A. on Tues
day and Thursday nights.
Professor Ross believes that the
Mexicans who constitute most of the
class are tired of having their little
farms, stores or houses looted and
of continually being menaced by one
faction or the other. A number of
the uneducated class ot Mexicans
along the border cities have moved
their families across the line and de
sire to become permanent citizens of
the United States.
The classes are conducted for the
man who wants to become an Ameri
can citizen. Those attending the
classes are law-abiding, industrious
and hard-working people.
"The alien and ignorant class are
with us. differing from us in lan
guage, habits of thought and mode or
living. They are needed in this
Southwest to do work of many kinds
and they supply the deficit of what
would otherwise become a labor
shortage," says Professor Ross.
Continuing Professor Ross said: "It
is not for the best interests of the
United States that any number of
foreigners, whether Mexican, Italian
or Japanese, should remain here un
Americanized. It has been found
that the best means of making good
citizens of them is education, this
is a stepping stone to citizenship.
After they learn something of oun
ways of living and working they be
gin to have ambitions and definite
aim in life and that is the pout
where his progress up the ladder be
gins, and every community that
strives to educate its alien element
becomes a factor in these aliens"
lives for betterment."

INSECT INFECTION
FEARED BY U. S.
BRUSSELS. July 7 The city ot
Ghent, which is noted for its magni
ficent botanic garden, is greatly con
cerned over the ruling of the Amer
ican department of agriculture, pro
hibiting the importation of live plants
owing to danger of insect infection.
It is stated that this will mean a
yearly loss of business amounting to
two million francs.
As ng shipments have been .made
to America for the last three years,
it is felt that Americans have . no
proof as to the existence of insect
menace and the- authorities have re
quested through the consular chan
nels that an American expert be sent
to Ghent to test the soil and plants,
in the hope that the prohfintioj will
be withdrawn.

STORM VISITS
MTH
! K
HIGH UNO
Bonson was visited yesterday after
noon by the worst storm since 1896 when
the families of C. S. ' Ashburn and V.
M. Zeek were drowned in a cloudburst.
The streets were running with water
in a few minutes after the storm broke
accompanied by a hlRh wind which also
did a srreat deal of damage to property.
The front of the Benson Auditorium
was blown in, the residence of Sam Wil
Ron was badly wrecked, Mrs Wilson, ape
60, was injured by falling timbers. Tele
graph poles were blown down, small
houses washed away, C. F. Moss drug
store flooded with water, Benson baker
wagon with the horses hitched to it was
blown over and with an estimated two
foot fall of rain the total damage Is
thought to be around $5,000.
The flood waters washed around the
concrete dam recently completed by the
Benson Qanal company with the result
that the intake collapsed. The flood
came down the San Pedro river and white
the dam ie still holding, the water is
working towards the east nd of the new
concrete bridge on the Benson-Willcox
highway.
There is some fear that the bri1ge will
not withstand the flood waters although
County Engineer Sid Smith is there with
a force of men doing his lest to protect
the bridge.
51. P. Bosley, deputy game warden of
Benson, says the storm has done con
siderable damage not only in the town
but in the outlying districts in the wash
ing out of road crossings and up-rooting
trees.

Alaska's Governor
Seeks Lower
Steamship Rates
JfXE.Vr. Alaska, June 10. (By MalL)
Alaska gradually will lose population
and revert to a vast territory unpeopled
save for the seasonal fishing population
and operatives of a few great mines, if
lower steamship rntes from the outside
world cannot be obtained. Gov. Thoma
Uiggs. Jr , declared in a message to the
last Alaskan territorial legislature here.
The governor's message advocated the
consideration of the establishment of a
territorially owned passenger and freight
steamship line to compete with the prl
ately owned lines which operate from Se
attle. A line ownod by the territori could
operate for lower rates, the governor
argued.
"I realize that I am advocating a most
radical and startling departure foni ac
cepted standard!," the governor's mes
sage said. "The first impulse is to char
acterize the scheme as impracticable. It
is not impracticable, it is diaftincUy prac
ticable and will allow the territory to
toke on renewed 'ifc.
"Kvery other question sinks to insig
nificance, for back of it all rr.iA.iius the
basic fact that unless relief is afouled
us in "ur most vital n?ed, monies ex
pended on roads, schools, charities and
other constructive projects vor.s '.i
tute merely stop gap measures, never to
bear fruit."
Ocean lanes, it was pointed out, are
the only routes Alaska has to the out
sioe ij and if the lanes are blocked
1 y high prohibitive rates Alaska w:!i not
ri osper.
To carry out the governor's suggestion
the legislation authorized the appoint
ment of a territorial shipping Itoard to
get lower rates from the steamship com
panies or to work for the establishment
of a territorially owned line.
Governor Uiggs has leen named chair
man of the' shipping board. Maurice
Lcehey, a Seattle attorney, has been em
ployed by the hoard to handle the board's
business. Leehey is in Washington at
present and may endeavor to have con
gress pass ii resolution authorizing Alas
ka to bond intsrlf for $3.000., 000 to ob
tain money for the steamship line.

Mining and Financial News
BY REVIEW LEASED WIRE
NEW YORK, July 7. Steel led an
other issues at the strong and active
opening of today's stock market,
heavy buying orders for those shares
having accumulated over the triple
holiday. Gains of 1 to 3 points were
made by Crucible, Bethlehem, Repub
lic and United States Steel, allied in
dustrials and equipments also scoring
substantial advances.
Rubber, tobacco and food shares al
so rose materially over last week's
final prices and General Motors made
up more than its 3 per cent dividend.
Shippings and metals hardened but
inquiry for rails was comparatively
light.
NEW YORK, July 7. Approximate
ly 500,000 shares changed hands in the
first hour with no appreciable slack
ening of the feverish pace at noon.
Steels continued to feature the ad
vance but other speculative shares
were not far behind, notably the mo
tor, copper, oil, tobacco and food
groups.
Stutz motors led the list, adding 20
points to last Thursday's gain of 11
points.
Realizing cut into some of the more
important gains and relative heavi
ness was shown by rails and several
specialties, but the tone for the most
part remained strong.
Call money opened at 6 to 6 per
cent.
CHICAGO, July 7. Nervousness on
the part of shorts led to wild ad
vances today in the corn market. All
deliveries jumped to the highest level
yet this season. Continued record
breaking upturns in the value of hogs
did much to stimulate belief that corn
would ascend. Opening prices, which
ranged from c off to lc advance,
with September $1-85 to and
December $1.62 to $1.63. were fol
lowed by a slight sag, and then by
a radical advance all around including
7c for July to $1.94.
Oats shared in the strength of corn.
After opening c lower to c gain,
with September 70 to 71 c, the
market scored a moderate general ad
vance. Provisions were weakened by re
ports of good sized stocks both here
and abroad. There was no aggressive
buying:

DR.LD.RIGKETT5
BAG IN 5 E
Well Known Mining Engineer
Back From Pleasure Trip,
Copper Future Yet Uncertain
Dr. L. D. Ricketts, the well-known
consulting mining engineer for a
number of mining companies in the
Southwest and in Mexico, returned
Sunday from 'a two months' visit
spent in the East, and New York
City.
Here on Pleasure Trip
Dr. Ricketts stated yesterday that
nothing of importance could be at
tached to his vi3it East as it was
just a pleasure trip and he is back
in Warren now ready to go to work
again.
Future Still Uncertain.
He believes that the ending of the
war will have no appreciable effect
on the copper industry, insofar as
development work is concerned, for
some time. The prices of mining
materials and the cost of labor is
still high, which has resulted in min
ing developments and operations re
maining practically on the same
basis as they, have been during the
past few months, i
Well Known Here
Dr.. Ricketts has been an authority
on mining matters in the Southwest
for many years -a-id is very well
known. For fifteen years Doctor
Rickett3 was mine surveyor for the
State of Colorado. Since 1S90 he has
been connected . with ajl the large
development .work in the Southwest,
especially with, the Moctezuma Cop
per company at Nacozari, Mex.
Constructed Large Smelting Plant
His most important work has been
in the construction of-large modern
smelting and concentrating plants
for the Detroit Copper Mining com
pany and Moctezuma Copper com
pany. It was through his efforts that
the Old Dominion Copper Mining an
Smelting company at Globe was re
opened in 1901. He ,was formerly
consulting engineer for the Cananea
Consolidated Copper company and
since 1911-has been ' consulting engi
neer for the Calumet and Arizona
Copper company and the Arizona
Copper company, Ltd.
Says Greenway Back Soon
Dr. Ricketts stated yesterday , that
while he had no definite word from
Col. Greenway he thought he would
be back in the Warren district some
time next week.

both sides so badly that it will prob
ably not be rebuilt for some time. He
estimates the damage at $2000.

SILL DAMAGE
1ST
The storms of last week were in
tense in their nature. In fact, almost
cloudbursts but the work on all the
state highways and the new commis
sion roads were not hurt, so far as
heard from.
Walnut Gulch dip and Government
Draw, dip had small washouts between
the walls but nothing to delay traffic.
The only delay in traffic was when
the water was rushing through these
two dips during or immediately after
the several storms. The road between
Tombstone and the narrows was, wash
ed over in several places, but it did
not disturb traffic and was caused by
insufficient ditching or where ditching
had been filled up. The stage was
on time each trip during the several
days of storm, and this morning the
maintenance crew repaired the Gov
ernment Draw troubles and also the
Walnut Gulch dip. These dips will
have to be concreted, between the
walls.
County Engineer Smith reports no
particular damage to county roads.
It also appears that while the flood
near the smelters at Douglas was the
greatest ever recorded, the damage as
first reported was over estimated.
The Whitewater bridge at the sm&l
ter did not go out. Supervisor J. M.
Sparks says the Douglas damage to
the road near the smelter was greatly
overestimated, but the flood was the
greatest ever.
