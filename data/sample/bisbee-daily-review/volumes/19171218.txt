States Will Be Given Seven
Years in Which to Ratify or
Reject Constitutional Law
to Prohibit Sale of Liquors.
(By Review Leased Wire)
WASHINGTON. Dec 17. Nation
wide prohibition won the house today,
and or.ly the adjustment of a slight
difference in resolutions between the
house and senate new stands in the
way of submit tins to state legisla
tures an amendment to the federal
constitution forbidding the manufac
ture, sale or importation of intoxicat
ing liquor for beverage purposes in
the fnited States or its territories.
The vote in the house, taken after
a day of debate before crowded gal
leries, was 282 to 1-S. with the par
ties dividing almost evenly. The mar
gin for prohibition was just eight
votes more than the necessary two
thirds of the membership of the house
required for adoption and 26 more
than two-thirds of those voting.
lioth wets and drys had been pre
dict ing victory all day. and it was not
until the last few names bad been
called that the anti-prohibition forces
conceded their defeat. When Speaker
Clark announced the result the vic
tors were joined by the galleries in
such a demonstration as is rarely per
mitted in the bouse. Former Secre
tary Bryan, an interested spectator
nearly ali day, appeared on the floor
and joined in receiving congratula
tions with Representative Webb of
North Carolina, who led the fight.
Seven Years to Ratify
The resolution passed by the house
Is Identical with that passed by the
stnate last August, except that it
fcives the states seven years instead
cr six in whkh to ratify the amend
ment. Senator Sheppard. author of
the resolution, predicted tonight that
tre senate would accept the amend
Pient tomorrow. He said he had as
surances that the seven-year period
wouU be approved and ihat & did
not believe a roll call necessary.
The president's approval is not re
quired and the state legislatures may
act as soon as they please after the
signatures or the vice president and
Speaker Clark have been attached to
the resolution.
"It will te submitted as a Christ
mas present to the American people,"
s?id Senator Shentiard. "and I believe
It witl be ratified In three years."
Ertry attempt today to put on
amendments to except light wines and
beer was berten. and HI Democrats
stood aliened with 137 Republicans
ard four independents to win the final
victory for the prohibition forces.
Following is the resolution as
adopted:

PETROGRAD, Sunday. Dec. 17.
The commissary of foreign affairs has
notified the foreign embassies that
they must vise the passports of BoK
sheviki couriers or that similiar
courtesies will be refused them. The
notification says the government con
siders the question of recognition
purely formal, and that it does not
care about it in the least, but that
foreign governments must realize that
the Bolsheviki constitutes the de facto
government and extend to It the right
for its couriers to travel abroad.

And no doubt 200,000

So spent, $1,000,000 would
give much satisfaction.
But not so much satis
faction, we think,as the

This is how and why
we spend this $1,000,000.

To keep the OWL Cigar

requires that all OWL leaf

that requires that we keep

OUR GERMAN MUSICIANS.
- FriU Kreisler's declaration that be will no longer fiddle
for American audiences at least while the war continues
has had the calculated result. Press agents, friend?
and admirers have united to make him appear a martyr
to art and American chauvinism, says Charles J. Rose
bault, of the Vigilante. America is made to look small
and Americans mean. Do the facts bear out the im
putations? Kreisler is a great violinist and a great musical artist.
He has a Jarge following among mnsic lovers every
where. But Mr. Kreisler's following was not so large
before the press agent waxed eloquent over his ex
periences In the Austrian trenches. He had been just
as great an artist earlier but he had not been one of
the popular performers and his following had been limit
ed to tie cognoscenti. What is the implication from
the above? Why did his audience suddenly increase
from a merely respectable size to a huge overflowing
' crowd, filling orchestn. balconies, galleries and even
packing the stage itself?
This sudden popularity followed close npon the pub
lication of Mr. Kreisler's hardships as a soldier of the
Fatherland. After these his mere appearance evoked
tremendous ovations. The musical epicures were lost
in the throng of enthusiastic worshippers and there wa?
even more comment upon his pallor and the interesting
limp in his gait than upon the character and quality of
his musical performance. Need it be added that Teu
tonic faces and the German language were largely in
evidence?
There was no call for criticism hi all this. Mr. Kreisler
had done his duty as a loyal citizen of the land of his
birth. Americans could only' be thankful that he had
been saved from Russian shells and bullets to continue
his admirable art We were not at war then and he
was not an alien enemy. Whatever our sympathies in
the war might be, we had no animus against the indi
vidual Austrian who was sojourning with us.
Even now there is no desire to criticise" Mr. Kreisler
personally. There is. however, a very decided reason
for taking exception to the criticitsm of America Im
plied in Mr. Kreisler's ettitude or shall we say the at
titude into which he ha a been forced by his advisers?
This criticism of the country in . which Mr. Kreis
ler has found fame and fortune not obtainable
elsewhere bad lust ttis foundation that since
America entered the war he was no longer being viewed
entirely as an artist, but that many Amrirans were tak
ing cognizance of the fact that he was also a oitizen of
Austria, the ally of Germany. This was denounced as
narrow, email, contemptible. The finger of scorn was
pointed at the narrow-iciDded creatures who did not ap
preciate the universality of art. Fcr the retort that art
may be used to create sympathy for the nationality repre
sented by the artist there was contempt and derision.
The contention that enemy aliens should not appear in
the limelight brought forth thunders from many quar
ters. Perhaps these are justified.' Tobslbly art should be
judged solely as aa impersonal thing of beauty and the
artht held superior to decisions affecting common folk.
When all the world agrees upon this America will surely
not be found to lag behind. But what is the record of
Mr. Kreisler's own country and what is the record of
Germany in respect to art and artists?
There is in this country today a very wonderful Rus
sian violinist by the name of Heifetx. This artist who J
has been acclaimed by all critics and music lovers, was
playing in Berlin when the war broke out. He was high
ly regarded by the music lovers there. Did the Prus
sians uphold the exemption of tbe artist? Mr. Heifetx
spent two yean. to long valuable years in an intern
ment camp. ,
Joseph Joachim was almobt a musical god in Germany.
When be died his place at the head of the Hochwhule
was given to Henri Marteau, a Frenchman. This placing
of a foreigner upon Joachim's musical throne created "
furore. But Marteau had taught the Kaiser's sood-will.
Moreover, be bad Ix-eo a pupil and tbe ablest, of Joa
chim, fco the Hi oral ft Prussian chauvinism broke
arflitihl hiiik in lam tin.' m U:tt hmitwnitl. m lion t)i mar
came? Marteau lost his place and was Interned as an
enemy.
Cabrilowitch, the great pianist, was a resident of
Munich and strongly pro-German in his sympathies. So
was his wife, daughter of our Mark Twain. He was ar
rested and obtained his release only with great difficulty.
Adolph Brodsky. the distinguished Russian violinist,
who had been a favorite of the music lovers of Vienna,
was there on a holiday visit when the war came. He
applied for permission to return to England, where he
was President of the Manchester College of Music.
When he received a request to call at the government
bureau, he supposed that he was about to receive his
papers. But he no sooner crossed tbe threshold than
he was placed under arrest, was denied permission to
communicate with his wife, was not even permitted to
send for his necessary toilet articles, and the following
day before his wife could call to inquire about him
was already on his way to an internment camp in Hun
gary. He was past sixty, had spent the greater par!
of his life in Vienna and was known to be attached to
the people moreover the Vienese were proud to ac
claim him as a product of their schools. The utmost
influence of his many friends and admirers only suc
ceeded in obtaining permission for his wife to go and
live with him in the internment camp.
And it remained for certain musicians resident in this
country, (a lot of the pro-German musicians refused to
sign the petition) to secure Dr. Brodskys release. At
that time Austria was desirous of continuing friendly
relations with Americans.
In the light of these various instances America's nar
rowness of spirit is not so clear. Nor is this all that is
to be said. Some of these distinguished musical artists
who are posing as martyrs are not altogether what they
seem. Protest as mucn as tney wish, it is ainicuit to

TOKIO. Dec. 17. Kikijuro Ishii,
head of the Japanese mission which
recently visited the United States,
was the guest of honor at a banauet
given this evening which was attend
ed by 200 Japanese and Americans.
Baron Eiichi Shibusawa, president of
the American-Japanese assoications
and chairman of the Tokio Bankers'
association, presided. 'The guests at
the function were the members of the
special mission which visited the
United States; the American ambas
sador. Rowland S. Morris, and the
staff of the American embassy.
Tbe banquet was the most repre
sentative of any gathering of recent
years and gave Viscount Ishii his first
opportunity to speak to the entire
Japanese public since his arrival from
.he United States. Viscount Ishii
said:

cause. Tbey have been too out-spoken heretofore.
There has been a great to-do about the opposition to
Mr. Muck, the very able conductor of the Boston Sym-
phony Orchestral Here again American chauvinism was
held up to scorn. But reverse the cause. Imagine an
American conductor at Berlin or Vienna! Where would
he be now? We must allow Mr. Muck credit for hav
ing made no secret of his sympathies. Nor has he con
cealed the fact that he still holds a place under the
Prussian Government and is looking forward to a Prus
sian pension for his old ape.
Of late many of our visiting musicians have been more
than zealous in performing the Star Spangled Banner.
Even pianists have pounded out the national anthem.
But this has not succeeded in breaking dutrn all the op
position. Some suspicious Americans talk of camouflage.
And they add that th?y see no reason why American
dollars should go into rnemy pockets when American
musicians like Albert Spaulding, Roderick White and
many others are sacrificing their careers and risking
their lives for America.

"Well." said the big fellow, "You can put your money
into Railroad Stocks, you can buy Standard Commercial
Stocks, or you can take long chances and buy stock in
seme Gold Mine which may or may not make you a
Millionaire, Do you know anything about stocks, shares,
or investments generally?"
"Not a thing.
"Well, what is your first . requirement in an invest
ment, do you want high interest, or absolute safety?"
"Absolute safety no chances for me. Why. I wouldn't
sleep nights and my wife would never quit worrying if
I took chances."
"Well," was the reply, "I can advise you to buy some
good Commercial Stock but I want to warn you that
owing to trade " conditions being upset of course the
Stock might be .low just when you wanted to sell. Would
you mind that?"
"Yes, I believe I would. Of course I know all Stocks
go up and down a little in price, but I must have some
thing that can't go down too low, because I might want
my money any time, and I can't afford to lose 5' to
10',; of my investment jrst for the sake of securiug 5'i
to 10'; interest."
"So you want something that is so safe it will not
rause you one moment's worry, you want something that
you can purchase, hold, and feel safe about without your
liaving to learn anything about stocks, shares, or mar
ket prices."
"That's it. exactly."
Tbe business man had known right along what in
vestment this man needed, but be wanted the farmer
to tell himself first. "Well," he said with a smile,
"What's the matter with investing with the United
States Government? You won't liave to stt tip night
wondering whether tli:y are going to fafl. You dou't '
have to know one tiling about stocks, shares or markets,
in order to get in on the proposition, and. your liule 4'c

"Oh. you mean buy a Liberty Bond?"
"Yes, why not?"
"Well. 1 guess I can't do better."
"Belter, why aian. yoa can't do as well. It's th- only
kind of Investment for a fel'.ow like yourself who knows
all about fanning and uotbing about finance. Your bond
Is the best collateral In the world, you can always sell
it If you have to. and believe me there Is a feeling of
satisfaction alout owning one ol those bonds that yoa

ful experience. We sailed npon a

"It affords me the keenest gratifl
cation to tell you that we bring back
to all the people of Japan from all the
people of America a message charged
with an earnest spirit of good will
and a sincere desire for a good un
derstanding and friendship. The an
swer to your message of good will
was delivered to us by the whole
people cf America; by men whose
names stand hiehest in the roll ol
American honor. Let there be no
doubt among you as to the sincerity
of the message. There was no false
note in it: there was no discordant
one in the voices welcoming us. We
are well aware that our personalities
played no part in tbe treatment we
received from the president and the
people of the United States, which
was intended for our emperor and our
people.
America l rue Gold
Now, returning from our voyage o!
discovery, we bring the assurance
that the true gold of America lies at
the very heart of its people. We are
very earnest in uor desire to convinct
the whole people of this country of
the value and real meaning of the
reception of this mission at the hands
of the people of the United States.
Here let me refer to the notes ex
changed between Japan and America.
For the consummation of this national
agreement I stand personally a debtor
to President Wilson and Secretary of
State Lansir.g for unusual "courtesies
and considerations. As the result of
the frank exchange of opinion we ar
rived at an agreement which must
help America, China and Japan.
"The mutual declarations with re
gard to China ought not to be the
subject of suspicion. Neither should
they under any consideration give of
fense, because where no offense is in
tended no offense can be given."

WASHINGTON. Dec. 17. Two Ital
ian torpedo boats under Lieutenant
Commander Rizzo composed the force
Mh made the daring raid into the'
inner harbor at Trieste Sunday night.!
Iecember 9. and torpedoed two Aus
trian battleships, one of which was
seen to sink. Further details of the!
exploit were given in dispatches re
ceived by the Italian embassy today, i
The raid was planned when it was
learned that the Austrian were pre
paring to send from Trieste two ships
of tbe Monarch type, with their 240
millimeter guns, to bombard Italian
coastal positions, A division of tor
pedo boats under Captain Pignattl was
assigned to the task, and tbe captain
selected Lieutenant Commander Rixzo
ith two boats to make the dash Into
the harbor, while the. remainder of
the division kept outside in support.'
Use Heavy Fog j
By slow and silent movement i
through a heavy fog the little craft j
reached the extremity of the Muggia'
pier, where the officer examined the
disposition of the numerous obstruc
tions which Toarred the passage. Mine '
fields and other obstructions were lo-i
cated, and two hours were spent cut-'
ting eight large wire cables stretched ',
across the passage. 1
During all this time Austrian out-,
posts were very near and searchlights
were being played on tbe water, but:
in spite of this the torpedo boats sue-,
reeded in entering the inner port with
out being sighted.
Two Austrian battleships were
drowned at anchor at the further end,
of the harbor. Proceeding cautiously.;
the Italian vessels approached to as
certain whether there were any pro-i
tecting nets or other obstructions,!
.'hen took up positions for the at
tack. Attack Launched
Finally at 2:30 a. m. Monday the
two torpedo boats simultaneously
launched four torpedoes aimed at thej
battleships. All fonr torpedoes ex-:
ploded. Rizzo reported that the bat-j
tleship Wien. nearest the attacking,
vessels, was observed to sink in five;
minutes, while the other battleship
certainly" was struck, though owing to'
the great distance it was impossible:
to discover the damage done.
At the sound of the explosions Aus
trian batteries opened fire and search
lights swept the waters. The lights
located the attacking vessels and the
Austrian guns were brought to bear
cn them and torpedoes fired, but the
Italians escaped.

There Is more Catarrh In this section of
the country than all other disease put
together, and until the last few years
was supposed to be Incurable. For
great many years doctors pronounced It a
local disease and prescribed local reme
dies, and by constantly failing to cure
with local treatment, pronounced It Incur
able. Science has proven Catarrh to be a
constitutional disease, and therefore re
quires constitutional treatment. Hall's

There's But One
Safe Way to Buy
I keep in close touch with market
conditions of food products. I am correctly
informed as to the cash and food value cf practically every
article of table and baking use. My knowledge and close
acquaintance with baking materials 2nU their quality and
money worth passed oa to y ra in rr.y articles, should aid in
the selection of proper foods r.t proper prices.
You have often heard the expression
that "water seeks its own level." This same
thought miht well be applied to merchandise.
Inferior merchandise may find a
ready demand when first put on the market
but its inferiority is soon four.;l out and its sa!i usually takes
a slump. Hence I have ccme to the conclusion that the
biggest seller is the best buy.
When some certain brand is given
a wide preference over all similar merchandise
it means but one thing meri; has proved it best.
So it follows that if housewives would
purchase only mercliandise thit meets the
greatest demand their buying would be far more satisfactory.
I have noticed invariably that the
demand for a product rJways verifies the value
of a product determined by scientific tests w hich proves my
contention conclusively.
Take baking powder. The biggest selling
brand on the market today r roved to mr by the most critical
experiments that it is entitled to the preference it has rained.
There are more pounds cf Calumet sold than
any other brand of baking rotvder. Ufachas proved its
superiority cr tests pointed ti the cme fact. Tfcc woman who
boy Calumet eliminates ail pc-iile waste. She profits by. the ex
perience of millions of women w-a after tr-stins miry diftrrwt brands
of baking powder nd Csiucet I -t. It is safe to 017 because over
whelming choice shows the sap-na ti5sctica i: riders the vast
majority of housewives.
I have mads investi j-iticns and trips through
many plants that manufactv:: j iood ertides, and I h-ve yet
to Snd a finer and bettsr equipped, r?cr2 cp to dare, sanitary p'ant
than that of the Calumet Biki-3 i'owjrr Co. Anjonr Trho will isit
this plant will readily nniersM:u'. rrty thry should a-d how they do
manufacture bating powder that .!s a 1 the requirements.
