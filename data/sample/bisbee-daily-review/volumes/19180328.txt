British Premier Says Time Is
Vital and Need of. Rein
forcements Cannot Be Ex
aggerated (f'.v Kviw !-.wt Wire)
NEW YORK. March 27. A message
from David Lloyd George, prime minis
ter of England, calling on the United
States 'to end American reinforce
ments across tne Atlantic in the short
est possible spice of time," was red
tonight by Lord Rearding, British higl
commissioner to the United States, at
a dinner given here toi his honor.
"We are at the crisis of the war, at
tacked by an immense superiority of
Germn troops," said the premier in
his message. "Our army has been
carried oat methodically before the
pressure of a steady succession of
fresh Cerr.ian reser.es wnich are suf
fering enormous losses.
"The situation is being faced with
splendid courage and resolution. Thi
ccjjed pluck of our troops has for the
moment, checked the ceaseless onrush
of the er.e-Tiy, and the Frer.ch have
new joined in the struggle. BVt this
battle, the greatest and most momen
tous in the history of the world, is on
ly jjst begirding. Throughout it the
French and vitlsh are buoyed witi
the knowi'f ' hat the west will ne

troops -."'P t0 Europe.
"!n vp1&Z7Zs vital. It -is impossi
ble to Exaggerate the importance of
getting American reinforcements
across the Atlantic in the shortest pos
sible space of time."
The dinner, given by the Lotus Clus
in honor of Lo.-d Reading, was the
most largely attended of any in the
history of that organization.
Aiter reading the message from Mr
Lloyd George, the I.ritish high com
missioner declared that every nation
arrayed against Germany must muster
all its resource.; and the enthusiastic
devotion of every citizen is necessary
if the w;:r is to be won. That is tho
los.--.on which must be learned, he do !
flared, lo achieve victory in the con
flict in which the principles upon
v. Inch humanity is bused are at stake.
"It is ine?lcul;iile." said Lord Heart
ins, "vliat the results would be if we
vie lo f;:ii. We cannot f-ul. because
if v.e did humanity would stagger an'i
be crushed. Kal 1 do not 'for one mo

Pointed out. by a number of causes.
Gradually, these are being overcome,

THE BISBEE DAILY REVIEW, THURSDAY MORNING, MARCH 28, 1918.
HURLEY TELLS
OF MANY SHIPS
NOW UNDER WAY
t ."uilliliat J from 1ik n-
be laid. 1 doubt if the magnitude of
the task is generally appreciated.
Exceed 1916 Output
The total amount of our steel con
sirm tiou program on Marin 1 ai
b.2.'!j.7lS Head weight tuns. This is
matte up of u.lbn,:!(Mj dead weight tons
under contract with the Emergency
Fleet t orporatioa and 3,S4r,4uS dead
w eight tons of requisitioned vessels.
"Of this total steel construction
2.1J1.00S dead weight tons has been
completed. That means that in addi
tion to the building of our big yards
e have also been building ships. That
is, the program tor steel ships has ad
vanced -S per cent toward completion.
Of the amount of steel ships under
contract and under requisition, 6a;.,
40ti. deajl weigh: tons, or approximate
ly S per cent were actually completed
and in service on March 1. This
amou.it of Moating tonnage exceeds
our total output iu 11)16, including steel
wooden and saiimg vessels, by approx
imately 5l' per t-eut.
".Notwithstanding the difficulties of
organization the handicap of bad
weather, transportation embargoes and
l am cad congestion, nearly as luuc.'l
tonnage has iteen constructed in Amer
ican ship yards in three months as by
all tile itiu-r maritime nations of the
world comoined.
"The proposal to build ships of con
creie was at first regarded as a fas
cinating absurdity. On March 14 there
was launched lroiu the yards of the
Sail Francisco company, the first con
crete ship, a vessel whuh the builders
christened "Faith." We hope she will
exemplify the name.
Not Fcr Conscription
"Now. as lo labor, our strong right
arm. Theie has been much lain of
conscripting laoor. of forcing it intj
trie siiipyaids as our soldiers have
been brought into the camps. I am ful
ly aare that 1 tin flying in the face
of a growing popular sentiment that
men should be uiafted into the indus
try wcich supports the battle lines, dik
I wish to put myself on record as be
ing opposed to the conscription of lah
or. 1 do not beiieve conscription nec
essary for i beiieve labor itself will
produce a condition which will rendet
idle ail thought of conscripting work
men. "It would be useless to manufacture
material ami supplies and pile up the
products on the wharves it there are
r.o ships to transport them.
"So, unless our ship workers do their
best, other industries must slow dow.i
or halt completely with the result tha.
thousands of workers will suffer for
lai k of employment.
"I believe that labor (has begun to
realize tins fact, but I want to drive
it bj.'ue to Uie.n; ior there are som,
I regret to say. who do not yet sense
tueir re.HniiiMlity. There are many
who are not working to their full ca
pacity. There are many who, because
of th-i high wagys they are earning, are
i prone to lake too many holidays. Lab-,
: or generally throughout our ship yprds 1
; is today receiving the highest wages
ever paid for similar work. The addl-;
, tional cost of our ships, due to in
1 creased wages in ship yards, will be In t
' excess of $:ino.niH'.i0i. We expect and
we have a right to expect ; the country
has a right to expect, that labor will
render for this increase of wagej a
corresponding increased output in
ships.
Asks Help Of Labor
"AH has not gone smoothly in the
labor situation and there have been
times when this phase of the problem
was enough to causte discouragement.
The vast majority of laboring men are
patriotic; the leaders, whom I have
known through close contact in Wash
ington, especially Mr. Gompers, and .
his immediate associates, have mf con-1
tidence and the country re.-cgiiiv.es :
their patriotism. With only one excep
tion, the leaders of the shipyards craft
have shown a spirit of cooperation rea
dy to sink their personal differences
iu the common pool of patriotism.
"We have established labor adjust
ment boards whose complete fairness
canuot be questioned. Till scal-j of
wages awarded by this bord has been
most liberal. e have not blamed
labor for the reduced average output
iu various yards. There are some lab
or restrictions which we would like to
have removed 'restrictions against
output. We would like to see the whole
body iff labor put forth its maximum
etfi.rt, encouraging each individual
workman to do his best without any
fear of establishing new average stan
dards when they increase the output.
When all the leaders and ail the men
take this view of the national emergen
cy, the efficiency of all the yards will
be measurably increased.
" in 116 there, were less than 4,00'
men employed in all the shipyards oi
the country and on March 2, 1918, we
had increased this number to 2o6,0o0
of wnom ITO.jSH were working on actu
al ship construction and the remaind
er in yard construction, and other
branches of the industry. Thousands
of others are taking out timbers for
our wooden construction and the
scores of land steel plants which are
fabricating parts for steel vessels.
"1 have outlined the entire situation
in utmost frankness concealing
nothing, for we have nothing to con
Veal. Shipping is the essence of the
struggle in whicli the world is now en
gageu the central beam of the whole
war structure. If that fails, all else
fails. W e are engaged in a race with
tne submarine. The whole government
in Washington is alive to it, and there
is complete cooperation to bring suc
cess in this greatest task to which.
America has set herself."
FIRST PHASE
OF OFFENSIVE
NOW FINISHED
GIVE EXACT FIGURES
WASHINGTON, March 27. Exact
figures on the progress of the ship
building in the L'nited States were
made public tonight by the shipping
board as a result of debate in the sen
ate during which officials said state
ments had bee'i .made based on inac
curate information.
Since the shipping board began its
ork. 1SS vessels have been launched
of which 103 have been completed and
put jiito bervice. The launching
were divided between Wo requisition
ed vetsels aiid 2i which were built on
contract in yards constructed for the
purpose, or which had only just been
put ir.to operation.
u 'ontlnuM from Pne One?
against the stiffened opposition of the
British.
Hard local battles were still in prog
ress, but the first fury of the German
onsaulght had spent itself. Several
attacks which the Germans essayed
were smashed, and at Sailly. where
the Cernians last night gained a foot
ing, the British this morning delivered
a smashing counter attack, whica
pushed the invaders back.
The spirit of optimism was higher
along the front today.
SOLDIERS CONFIDENT
WITH THE BRITISH ARMY IN
FRANCE. March 27. (By the A. P.)
The faith of the men in the British
army in their ability to cope with the
hard hitting Germans has never flag
ged from the sttrt. and those troops
which are coming backq from fierce
battles of the last few days, in which
they fought as they probably never
had been called upon to fight before,
are filled with confidence. One reas
suring sign is that the enemy is begin
ning to use his old troops in continuing
the assault. German prisoners declare
that never before had they seen such
fighting as they experienced since last
Thursday. They battled like demona.
and like flies they are coining into the
prisoa camps hungry ami sullen and
declaring that they are sick of the
whole business. The British army con
tinues to exact a great toll of life from
the enemy. Last night the entire area
of the Somme battle field, over which
the Gentian emperor's troops have
spread themselves, was subjected to a
most terrible bombardment, which
lasted until daylight.
Shrouded With Smoke
The gunning along the front of the
past week has been appalling and the
zone is shrouded with a towering grey
ish haze from burning explosives.
There has been practically no change
in the British line since yesterday.
During the night the enemy tried to
advance on Colincamps. northwest of
Albert, but was thrown back. Similar
attempts against the neighboring vil
lage of Auchonvillers met a like fate,
and the British captured prisoners.
The Germans were in force in this sec
tor. Bavarians being included among
the troops.
Another attack was delivered at Ah
laznzevelle.. but was flung back. Ther.e
mark the principal events along the
British front.
Ae renewal of the offensive is ex
pected as soon as the Germans have
had t:me to prepare themselves.
Touching scenes are wild among the
civilian population in the areas affect
ed by the German offensive. For day:
these civilians have been coming back
from their homes, following one anoth
er dumbly like sheep toward havens of
safety. . . IEXZ

Under Act of March S, 1879.
Holding the Line j
A summary of the War situation last
night was actually cheering to the friends
of the allied cause. In a nutshell the situa
tion is this: The Germans have expended
several hundred thousand men in their su
preme effort cf the war and have suc
ceeded in taking about forty thousand
prisoners and four or five hundred guns
(most of them of small caliber) and from
four to ten miles of flat and barren ground
on a twenty-mile sector from which they
had retreated a year ago, following their
defeat in the Somme offensive of the Brit
ish in 1916.
Reports from all sources yesterday and
last night indicated that the drive had been
checked and that counter attacks were
gaining ground. British and French re
serves have arrived.
GERMAN RESERVES HAVE BEEN
USED UP!
Most of the ground gained by the Ger
mans has been voluntarily given up to save
needless loss of life. The allied strategy
has been consistent throughout the drive.
Time and again troops have been with
drawn from exposed positions that they
had successfully defended. Thsce troops
withdrew reluctantly. In some cases only
peremptory orders were necessary to com
pel the men to retreat. And as the German
sheep came forward tc the shambles the
merciless and unending hail of machine
gun bullets and light artillery blasts and
rifle fire mowed them down.
A careful consideration of all reports
upon the different sectors of the offensive
and withdrawal show this same bloody
scene enacted time and again. Massed
German advance; the British riddled
them, first with a barrage, then with ma
chine guns and lastly with rifle fire; the
British retreat, and the heavy artillery
- again pla$ upon the German "vic
tors. Again the Germans advance in
waves and the British resume their terrible
fire from a fresh position. A few hundred
men agair.st thousands, that was tr-e story
of the retreat across the desolate ground
west of St. Quentin that the Gemans had
made a waste place last spring. To make
them pay for every foot, was the British
plan, and then to stop them dead el a place
decided upon before the attack began.
The offensive has failed of its object.
It new remains only to count the German
dead and prepare for the April baltles yet
to come.
The British Tommies and the plain poi
lus, yes, and the American doughboys (for
the Americans are in the battle now) with
stood the worst terror the Huns had, face
tc face. It remains to be seen how tne
foiks at home withstood this blow. Part
of the German plan of this offensive was
to terrorize the people of the allied nations
behind the battle lines. Always the Ger
man plays for this psychological point It
wa3 an attack upon the" allied morale, as
veil as the allied battle line. If he can
shake the the morale of th allied nations
he can gain a victorious peace, even if he
cannot break the allied fighting line. The
Tommy and the poilu were indomitable
from the beginning of the drum fire last
Thursday mornirv to the last bit of fight
ing recorded by ti e telegraph this inorn-
ing. And it is up to us to keep not only a
i stout heart, but a hip:!- and confident cour
7 age and a firey resolution to se this bloody
turmoil through. "I.'e Blonc'e Beast is run
ning blood at ev-ry pore and his prey still
stands before htm watchful, wary, strong
and eager to ccnt'"u(- the fray.
Let us be of good cheer and send on.
mere men and food and guns, not forget
ting to cheer and praise the men who have
fought so well for our cause. Laughing
Tcmmies and grim poilu still face the foiled
Hun in Flanders, ready for more of his
game and eager to play just as fast and
furious as he desires.
DOING OUR BEST
Now is a time for doing our very best
not our "bit." The time is here for con
certed and concentrated action. The need
is vital. Events on the west front in the
past four days have aroused the naticn to
the dangers of enemies and the importance
of consummation of our task. Every unit
of the nation, every state, every count',
every municipality, and every individual
must produce to the limit.
There are many way3 in which we may
do our best. 4Ve may strip off our ccats,
roll up our shirt sleeves, and hurl ourselves
into the campaign for the sale of Liberty
bonds or war stamps. We may enlist our
services in the army. We may conserve
foodstuffs vital to the welfare of the
troops. We may devote our time to the
prosecution of internal enemies of the na
tion. Here in Bisbee each individual can as
sist. He can find time to join in war work
programs. He can give increased applica
tion to his business for war production,
and for the welfare of the nation. He can
turn his purse inside out to lend funds to
the government, and to assist the Red
Cross and other meritorious organizations.
And heican throw himself heart and soul
into the building of greater patriotic zeal
and fervor. He can become a part of the
earnest, loyal, intense patriotic Spirit for
which the times call in response to battle
action on the other side.
Vigorous, staunch, patriotic support of
the non-partijan ticket in the city primaiy
and election offers every citizen an oppor
tunity to assist in the fostering cf this spirit
of the times. Support of the president and
authorities at Washington by even the
rmallest units of the nation are a part of
thoprcgram for building up patriotic zeal.
The non-partisan ticket has gore on rec
ord in support of the national administra
tion ; it is based upon demand for the high
est war-time efficiency in the community;
it is in direct opposition to those who are
enemies of this country and who. have
fceen working insidiously to bring this
country to the state cf utter helplessness
to which they brought Russia. It is an
issue with a nation-wide bearing here in a
district which prepuces a rr.etal for which
there is a world-wide demand.
A city administration such " as will be
given Bisbee by the men on the non-partisan
ticket will represent one of the cogs in
this nation working with just that much
more efficiency and to just that much
greater benefit to the country. With such
an administration the city officials will be
doing their "best," and not their "bit." Bis
bee can do her "best" by seeing that the
ncn-partisan ticket is elected with such a
majority that they will enter office assured
of the hearty and whole support of this
community. And every citizen can do his
or her best by registering for the city elec
tion as a non-partisan, and supporting the
non-partisan ticket.
ONE TOUCH CF COLOR
We read of war, think of war, talk of
war, constantly. Almost, we breathe the
war, so engrossed is this world in the
Titian clash on the west front.
Two mUlicn feet trample the. ground
into a gory mud. Shells burrow deep
chasms in the face of the earth. The pat
ter of machine-gun fire and rifle3 cuts off
the grass at the roots. Desolation grows
hourly along the entire battle front.
The blood of thousands stains the fertile
Flanders soil.
Three wild flowers of spring have
opened their petals to Arizona's blue skies
beside the car tracks near Warren. They
are the one touch of color to relieve for the
moment the mind of war. They hold the
inimitable coloring of Arizona desert
growths. A delicate red, almost hinting
the pink of ribbons twined into the baby's
first clothes, tops the brilliant green of the
plant.
Springtime and wild-flower time have
come in France. Fresh forces are rushed
into the front-line trenches to relieve the
tired heroes of the allied armies. Blood
stained, smoke seared, mud covered, fight
ing men leave the scene of death, the blood
colored trenches, for rest behind the lines.
And we wonder, does the touch of color
in the first of spring's wild flowers, hint to
the soldier of ribbons twined into the
baby's clothes or of the blushing cheek
or of the blood spilled eastward in the land
of carnage?
The ambassador of the provisional Rus
sian government to the United States, Mr.
Bakhmeteff, repudiates' Germany's peace
terms. Isn't there some way to run that
man for president of Russia?

hills of the Winchester mountains at
the bands of a young man named Roy
Heame. who Is now here in jail charg
ed with murder.
It seems that Arrowood yesterday
morning left his ranch to go to the
mountains to get a loud of o-U for a
widow named Mrs. Stewart. Ar-1
rowood went as far as the Stewart'
place and told her that he vas going !
to get her the load of wood that he '
had promised to get and for her to get
ready and go on the wagon with hi':,
up to the mountains. She did and they '.
reached a point near the foot hills
when Roy llearne rode up on horse
back and addressed his remarks to Ar
rowood and said: "Where are you go
ing?" Arrowood replied: "I am going ;
to get a load of wood for Mrs. Stew art ' i
llearne replied: "You will not get any
wood out of these hills if I know it.";
Arrowood replied: "Well. I do not
know that you own all the wood in the
hills. I have a permit from Mr. Cooiile :
to get some wood Irom his claim.";
Hearne rode away and Arrowood anl
Mrs. Stewart went on into th hills. '
The load became rocgh and Anowoc.d '
told Airs. Stewart to wait for him and '
that he would get the wood am' ro-ne
hack for her. She got off the wagon
and he went on up into the hills, lie
was gone an hour or so and was return
ing and reached a point within about I
fifteen or twenty yard of her. and sh-j '
was walking toward the wagon wheuj
llearne again rode up to the wagon j
and bad a few words with Arrowood.
which she did not hear. Of a sudden
sho saw Hearne reac h up on the wag-j
on seat where AVrowood always had a
rifle and take it. throwing it on the ;
ground, and pulling an au'omatic pis-
lol from his pocket and shot Arrow ood !
twice, killing his almost instantly. !
She ran to his aid and Hearne stood
there. She said to Hearne: "You ouglu :
to be ashamed to have killed him, he j
is an old man f nd has sons and ;
daughters." He is alleged to have re-.
plied. "If you s'tay with me in this, I
will make you comfortable the rest of
your life." He got on his horse then
and lode off and she got Arrowood's
body into the wrgon and drove down
to the first ranch house and sent for;
help. Word was brought here and
Constable Jess Moore secured a coro
ner's jury and we t out and viewed
the ImmIv. At the same time Heariie
whs placed under arrest by Moore. He
i'w in the branch county jail and a
guard has been placed over the jail.
Arrowood has been a resident of the
Wiilcox section'for a number of years
and has been one of the most law abid
ing and progressive etiizens in this lo
cality. Ho was a widower but leave
two sons aited "0 and L'2 years and a
daughter about is years. The funeial
services will b held here tomorrow.
There Is considerable feeling over the
killing.
