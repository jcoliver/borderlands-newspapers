The United States navy dirigible
C-5 which escaped from its moor
ings here this afternoon dropped
into the sea about' 85 miles off
chore, according to a radio mes
sage received tonight by the
cruiser Chicago from an unidenti
fied British steamship.
The steamship said It was
standing by the dirigible. The
destroyer Edwards which went
out in pursuit ot the blimp was
notified by wireless of its position
and started to salvage the ship.
Blasts Hopes for Ocean Flight
Plans of the United States navy for I
a trans-Atlantic flight by a dirigible
received a serious jolt today when the j
giant "blimp" C-5 burst from her:
moorings in a gale and was swept out '
to sea' soon after Bhe had arrived from
Montauk Point, after being in the air
continuously for 25 hours and 45
minutes.
Lieut. Charles Little of Newbury
port, Mass., who was given charge of
the C-5 after her crew had been bund
led off to bed aboard the cruiser Chi
cago, was almost carried away by
the fugitive gas bag while making a
nervy attempt to deflate it.
Seated in the blimp's nacelle
when she broke away, he seized
the rip cord and gave a tug which
should have opened up the big
envelope and permitted the gaa to
escape. The cord broke, how
ever, and Lieutenant Little, realiz
ing he would be unable to bring
the ship down, leaped out from a
height of 25 feet. His only in
jury was a sprained ankle.
The escape of the C-5 followed a'
long struggle by sailors from the
cruiser Chicago to prevent its injury
when gully winds swept across its
mooring place in Qutdividi basin and
began to swing it about. Several ot
the sailors, clinging to guy ropes, were
thrown down by the dirigible's final
tug, but none was injured.
100 MensFlght Gale
A landing crew of 100 men under
the direction of Lieutenant Little had
fought with the gale for control of the
C-5 for six hours before it broke away.
Wholly unsheltered in a wind-swept
field, the dirigible pitched and buck
ed, stripping her bottom "of canvas
and then tearlDg the bow planes away.
Fenders were .placed to blunt the
shock and the men of the landing
crew rode wildly as they clung to, the

VILLA INFLICTS HEAVY
LOSSES Oil FEDERALS
WASHINGTON, May 15. Mexican
rebels allied with the troop3 under
Francisco Villa attacked the town of
Corralitos May 6 and in the resultant
battle inflicted severe losses on fed
eral troops under General Pablo
Quiroga, who were hurrying Inorth
to the relief of Chihuahua City, which
was being menaced by the Villistas.
General Juan Barragan, chief of
taff ot the Mexican army, has refused
to deny or affirm that the battle at
Corralitos was a victory for the reb
els, but General Quiroga is quoted as
saying the Villistas were compelled to
withdraw.
s HOP Off"
TREPASSEY, N. F., May 15. The
navy's two giant seaplanes, NC-1 and
NC-3, which have been waiting here
for several days for a favorable op-
I portunity to start their trans-Atlantic
.flight, tried to "hop off" today, but
I failed.
The two seaplanes today taxied
down the harbor, their fuel tanks full,
but never left the water. While no
official statement that the pilots in-
tended to 8tart their 1350 mlle cruige
to the Azores has been made, it is
believed that had the planes been
able to take the air they would have
attempted the flight,
After cruising down the harbor.
apparently in an effort to lighten
their load. Shortly
ever, they returned
afterward, haw
to their mother
ships.
While the planes were still taxieing
about the harbor, the NC-4, which last
Thursday dropped out of the initial
leg of the trans-Atlantic flight and
put in at Chatham, Mass., for repairs,
arrived. The failure of the NC-1 and
the NC-3 to start today may mean
that the three planes will start to
gether when hey attempt to cross the
Atlantic.
OPTIMISM IS ENDURING
WASHINGTON, May 15. While
the probable loss of the navy dirigible
C-5 through a tremendous wind cur
rent at St. Johns, N. F., today, caus
ed keen disappointment to naval of
Governor of Philippines, 45,
Weds Third Wife, Girl of 18
CHICAGO, May 15. Francis Burton
Harrison, 45 years old, governor gen
eral of the Philippine islands, and Miss
Elizabeth Wrentmore, 18 years old, a
student of the University of Califor
nia at Berkeley, Calif., were mar
ried at 5:30 o'clock this afternoon.
The Rev. Johnstone Myers, pastor of
Immanuel Baptist church, officiated.
The ring ceremony was used. Only
a small party of guests was in attend
ance. The marriage was the culmination
of a romance said to have begun a
year ago when the governor general
met the present Mrs. Harrison at a
dance at the palace in Manila. Miss
Wrentmore had been a student at the
University of Washington and a year
ago went to the University of Califor
nia. She is a daughter ot Professor!
Wrentmore, dean of the college of
Manila. ' ;
The romance met obstacles, how
ever, and one' of them caused the mar
riage ceremony to be performed here
Instead of at the home of the gover
nor general's mother, Mrs. Constance
Cary Harrison, author, in Washing
ton, D. C.
Mrs. Wrentmore at the time the en
gagement was announced in New York
several months ago said she would
not give her consent to her daugh
ter's marriage to the governor gen
eral, who will be 46 years old next De
cember. His age she said, was the
only bar. But the daughter declared
she was of legal age and loved the
governor-general and would marry
him.
Another obstacle, a more recent one,
was a diphtheria quarantine at the
Wrentmore home in Berkeley.
Miss Wrentmore was Bald by the
Berkeley health authorities to have
disregarded the quarantine when she
left a short time ago. She came to
Chicago a week ago and applied to
the Chicago health department for
assurance of her status. Because of
the necessity for a delay during which
throat cultures were taken it was
decided to have the ceremony here
and Mr. Harrison came on from Wash
ington. The health department found
that the young woman was safely re
moved from any danger of contagion
NEWFOUNDLAND
RIGHT
BACK AGAIN
ficials here, the failure of the sea
planes NC-1 and NC-3 to get started
on the trans-Atlantic flight caused no
apprehension.
It was confidently expected that the
planes, possibly accompanied by the
NC-4 which arrived at Trepassey Bay
during the day, would get under way
just before sundown tomorrow and
reach the Azores some time Saturday
afternoon.
The navy department had no offi
cial reports at a late hour either as
to the attempts of the planes at Tre
pessey to get into the air carrying
the maximum quantity of gasoline or
as to the arrival there of the NC-4.
The efforts of Commander Towers
and Lieutenant Commander Bellinger
to get the NC-1 and NC-3 into the air
today to begin the flight to Europe
were probably in the nature of an ex
perimental start, officers here said,
although had the machines succeeded
in difting the heavy loads they car
ried without question they would have
proceeded. '
Officers here who have been in
close touch with the planes and dif
ficulffes of the flight have counted up
on at least one false start and are
convinced that the machines will get
away tomorrow afternoon, weather
permitting. The arrival of the NC-4,
however, may persuade Commander
Towers to wait even another day un
til that boat can be made fully ready
and the original group of three planes
make the start together.
and "arrangements for the wedding
were hastily beg'un yesterday.
Mrs. Wrentmore, the bride's mother,
was called suddenly back to Manila
on May 4. Today she cabled her con
gratulations to the governor-general
and Mrs. Harrison.
There was a third obstacle. Mrs.
Mabel Judson Harrison, the governor
general's second wife, today in San
Diego, Calif., obtained her final de
cree of divorce. With that bar sur
mounted, final details for the cere
mony were arranged at once. Mr. Har
rison's first wife was Mary Crocker,
of San Francisco, who died in 1905.
Mr. and Mrs. Harrison are expected
to start tomorrow for Washington to
visit his mother; They will probably
spend a few days in -New York also.
Then they will motor through New
England on their honeymoon trip.
The governor-general and Mrs. Har
rison plan to sail on June 12 for
Manila.

REDS DIG IAI
City . Entrenched, Battle . Is
Believed Imminent ; Peace
Treaty to Austj-ia Delayed
Allied Plan to Hand Terms
to Austria Wednesday Held
. Up by Chaos in Hungary
VIENNA, Wednesday, May 14
(By the Associated Press.) All
the allied representatives have
left Budapest and red guards arc
digging trenches about the city.
PEACE MEET SUMMARY
Although the peace terms which the
allied and associated powers are to
present to the Austrian delegation
are virtually complete and report has
it that next Wednesday has been
chosen as the day when the Austrians
are to be called before the peace con
gress, the negotiations may be delayed
by reason of the fact that Hungary,
where extremely unstable conditions
still exist, has failed to appoint dele
gates to go to St. Germain.
The council ot four Thursday con
tinued discussion of the military items
to be embodied in the Austrian com
pact. These, it is asserted, not only
will require demobilization of the Au
strian army and prevent future con
scription but will call for the dis
mantling of the famous Skoda works,
Austria's great armament factories at
Vienna and Prague where the mon
ster howitzers and other big guns
used by the Teutonic armies during
the war were made.
Premier Clemenceau on Thursday
discussed with Signor Orlando and
Baron Sonnino the claims of Italy with
regard to Flume and the Dalmatian
coast, which are still unsettled. While
it is reported that the Americans re
main opposed to sanctioning the turn
ing over of Fiume to the Italians,
another report is to the effect that
M.. Trumbitch, head of the Jugo Slav
commission, and Colonel House and
Thomas Nelson, Page, American am
bassador to Italy, have discussed the
formula of a compromise on Fiume.
A refusal to consider the note ot
the German peace delegation regard
ing international labor legislation has
been forwarded to the Germans by the
council of four. All the other Ger
man communications have been refer
red to peace conference commissions.
Count von Brockdorff-Rantzau, head
of the German delegation at Versailles,
is declared in a Berlin dispatch to
have informed his associates that the
peace treaty as it stands cannot be ac
cepted, as it would be impossible to
fulfill its terms, and that the signa
ture of the German delegation would
not be affixed to any document the
terms of which could not be carried
out.
EDITH GAVELL PAID
TRIBUTE BY BRITAIN
LONDON, May 15. (By the Asso
ciated Press) England today paid
tribute to Edith Cavell, the English
nurse executed, by the Germans . at
Brussels, October 12, 1915, when her
body, en route from Brussels to her
native city of Norwich, was taken to
Westminster Abbey for an impressive
memorial service.
48,909 U. S. Men
Killed in Battle
Is Revised Total
WASHINGTON, May 15v Re
vised figures made public today
by the war department showed
that the total casualties of the
American expeditionary forces
during the war were 286,044. Bat
tle deaths numbered 48,909, and
the explanation that this repre
sented a duplication of about 7000
by the reason of the fact that
many men were wounded more
than once.
Will Quit Paris Unless
Terms Are Modified Is
Rumanian Declaration
GENEVA, May 15. (By the Associated Press) The
Rumania delegation may possibly withdraw from the
peace conference. Advices. from Paris say that, owing to
the decision of the council of ten to divide Banat between
Serbia and Rumania, Premier Bratiano and the Rumanian
delegation will quit Paris unless there is a modification of
the terms.

FORD SUIT CHARGE
Claim Chicago Tribune Was
Urging Preparedness to
Aid the Kaiser
(By Review Leased Wire)
MOUNT CLEMENS, Mich., May 15.
Notice that the plaintiff in the $1,
000,000 libel suit of Henry Ford
against the Chicago Daily Tribune
and others will attempt to prove that
the Tribune in urging military pre
paredness three years ago did so in
an effort to aid Germany, was given
to the Jury here today by Attorney
Alfred J. Murphy of counsel for Mr.
Ford.
The statement was made in the
form of a final interrogatory to the
entire jury, selection of which was
finished -today. . . i . t
"We will try to prove," said Mr.
Murphy, "that the Chicago Daily Tri
bune, in its campaign for prepared
ness, was doing so solely in an effort
to embroil the United StateB in a war
with Mexico so that American mu
nitions would be used on this contl-
nent instead of being shipped to the
enemies of Germany. Does any mem
ber cf the jury hold views or has he
held views which would prejudice
him against a fair consideration of
eviednce to prove this contention?" '
The jurors all disclaimed that pos
sibility of prejudice. Since the mem
bers of the jury, all but one of whom
are farmers, will be permitted to re
turn to their homes at night. Judge
Tucker was particularly emphatic in
warning against discussing the case
with anyone.
i Lawyers on both sides professed
themselves as satisfied with the in
telligence of the jurors, all of whom
are men of mature year's.
Tribune lawyers expressed the be
lief that the charge of pro-Germanism
made by Mr. Murphy makes certain
that the Tribune will be allowed to
present the immense amount of evi
dence and testimony it has gathered
to prove that at the time the alleged
libel was published, June 23, 1916,
preparedness had become - a burning
necessity. It is the contention of, the
ocunsel for the Detroit manufacturer
that such evidenec is irrelevant and
that the only question properly before
the court is whether the editorial
headed "Henry Ford Is an Anarchist"
libeled or did not libel the plaintiff.
WILLARD - DEMPSEY
FIGHT PROTESTED BY
250 OHIO CHURCHES
(By Review Leased Wire)
TOLEDO, May 15. Formal pro
test against the Willard-Dempsey
world championship glove fight
was filed tonight with Mayor
Schreiber by the Toledo Minister
ial union, an organization of 250
churches. Copies of the protest
were mailed to Governor Cox at
Columbus and John F- Mathlas,
sheriff of Lucas county. These
officials were asked to prevent
the contest.
The protest said that the con
test would result in an invasion of
"gamblers, thieves and thugs," to
Toledo; that it would teach
youths to "gamble 'and that the
public records of the fighters
"justify the expectation that we
are to hae a gladiatorial contest
worthy of the Roman arena of in
famous memory."
Dempsey had not arrived late
tonight.

WINNEPEG, Manitoba, Can., May
15. Thirty thousand men and women
struck today after metal workers and
their tmployers had failed to adjust
their differences and .tonight the
city's transportation system and other
facilities were tied up. The strikers
included city firemen, who were re
placed by emergency men, and Ihe
city employes of the gas and water
works, which were manned by citi
zens. More than sixty unions joined in
the strike during the day after the
first men were called out at 11 a. m.
by . the Trade anil Labor council. ;
Although the police voted to strike,
they were ordered by unionists of the
strike committee to remain on duty.
No violence was reported during the
day.
Secretary Robertson of the labor
council tonight said that the strikers
would not return to work until they
obtained all their demands.
Train service was not impeded, al
though many shopmen quit work. The
trainmen are not included in the
strike.
The bakers walked out In the af
ternoon and the telephone operators
gave notice they would start a sym
pathetic strike Friday.
The police force has remained in
tact, but there is some fear that ttiey
may strike. The railways and switch

pered. About 4000 employes of the
Canadian Pacific railroad obeyed the
strike order, but it is announced that
the "big four" or combined union of

GERMAN PROTESTS
ARE FRAUDULENT
PARIS, May 15 (By the Associated
Press.) The conviction is growing in
allied circles that most of the German
protests against the peace treaty so
far received were written before the
reading of, the treaty and are designed
as propaganda. This conviction is
strengthened by the fact that the text
of the treaty is not quoted and that
the protests have been published in
Berlin before they were received iu
Paris.
The conference, however, is refer
ring all protests to commissions which
will consider them on their merits.

"K-K-K-Katy, beautiful Katy, You're
the OiiJy Girl That I Adore", rang
merrily- through the store of the
Phelps Dod.se Mercantile company
this morning and made customers and
passersby wonledel what was taking
place that caused such cheerfulness
among, the 1. D. -Mercantile employes.
Community singing, made so popu
lar by. the war, is being inaugurated
in the Warren district and Alfred O.
Kuhn, Y. M. C. A. overseas song di
rector, is showing the Warren dis
trict what community finging is and
what It means, and ro far Mr. Kuhn
is enthusiastic over the way the peo
ple of -Boabee are taking It up.
Mr. Kuhn, who was in the song
work in Fort Iiliss and later in En
gland and France, said, in speaking
of community singing: "It's effect
it not that alone lrom the singing
but is more psychological in its erfect
on the mind. It is well known that
no one. can sing who has a grouch
or hatred In their heart and the re
verse is true, that anybody that sings
has nothing but good feelings toward
everybody else. It is au effectual
'gloom buster,'"
On Tuesday evening the mothers of
the district had their first attempt at
singing at the Mothers' and Sous'
banquet at the Y; and mothers who
never knew " that they had vocal
chords before were working on the
beautiful harmony of "There's a
Long, Long Trail Awlnding," "Moth-
er Machree", and "Aloha." It was the
end of a perfect day" and a delight
ful evening when everybody went
heme happy and cheerful.
"Who would have though that the
hundred or more miners attending the
Warren District Mining Course on
Wednesday night would have enjoy
ed singing, but the enthusiasm with
which Mr. Kuhn led. put volume into
their voices that almost 'raised (be
rafters on the " gymnasium. More
curious still was the choral work of
the Americanization classes at the
High school, who got together later
Wednesday evening and 75 or SO for
eign born people, to whom the En
glish language is s'ill strange, put
their words to musfic and to their
own surprise rendered "Good Morn
ing. Mr. Zip, ZIP, ZIP."
Yesterday was a busy day for Mr.
Kuhn, meeting with the employes of
the Phelps Dodge Mercantile in the
morning at nine and later with the
Lowedd Junior. High and then with
the children of the Lowell Grammar
school massed on the playground
pinging the megaphone chorus of
"Keep the Home Fires Burning."
Then later in the morning camo the
Horace Mann school and the Central
school. .
It was hoped that everybody in the
community will have the chance to
hear and participate in this commun
ity singing as community singing is
a feature that has come to stay and I
stays only because the. people enjoy
it. There will be numerous demon
strations at the Y. W. C. A. carni
val, the Warren Tark dance, a regular
community sing at the Y. W. C. A.
tennis court on Sunday and almost
innumerable other affairs.
The affair at the P. D. Mercantile
was so enjoyed that It is to b re
peated again this morning so that if

customary previous to Olympic pama.
Instead, every army camp, student

letic union district has been request
ed to name one or more eligible and
from this roster a team of at least' 50
will be selected. Privates and of
ficers of the army or S. A. T. C. men
Inducted into the army, are eligible,
regardless of whether they served
abroad or have been mustered out
Kince the armistice.
PHOENIX, May 15 Of approxi
mately 50,000 tond of hay shipped from
thit section into almost every army
camp in the southwest during the past
six or eight months, 50 per ceat, at
a conservative estimate, was sold un
der false grading and much or it de
livered short of the certified weight.
This was the statement made today j
by federal department of justice of
ficials, who, on Tuesday last, arrested
Alfred J. Peters, prominent hay deal
er of Tempe and J. N. Jaggers, federal
hay inspector of Maricopa, on war
rants charging conspiracy to defraud
the government.
It is estimated by the federal inves
tigators that the alleged ring which
haidled the hay transactions netted
from $2 to $5 per ton above the legiti
mate profit and mulcted the army
of approximately $200,000, according
to the inquiry instituted so far. That
the final total of the alleged plunder
may reach a much larger figure Is not
denied.
Eighteen army camps in the states
of Arizona, Texas and New Mexico
received the hay in question, the cer
tificates covering the shipments which
will constitute important documents
la the case, went to the army forage
office at Chicago and now are on their
way here for checking with, the books
seized in Peters office.
While the present investigations
are being confined principally to the
past six or eight months, it is sus
pected by the federal officials that
the members of the alleged conspiracy
ring have been operating during the
entire period of the war.
During approximately the past half
year, from 6000 to 7000 tons of hay
have been shipped monthly by Peters
from the Salt River valley as sub-contractor
to dealers in El Paso. say. the
officers.. It is alleged that the prac
tice was to buy No. 1 or 2 standard
hay from the farmer and sell it to the
army for choice or top grade fodder,
the difference gained in price being
from $2 to $5 per ton. It also is
charged that carload lots received at a
certain weight were billed out to the
army posts at a much heavier scale.
Experts, who are going over' the'
seized records, stated .today-that they
had further discovered ' that when
first grade hay was being sold to
private buyers at. $24 per . ton, hay
marked at that grade, but actually of
inferior quality, was being .disposed of
to the government at $26 per ton." , ' -
Shipments to the following army
posts are' being investigated it was
stated today: In Arizona, Douglas,
Naco, Ft. Apache, Ft. Huachuca.
In Texas, San Antonio, Mercedes,
Marfa, FL McAllan at Safford. . Ft.
Travis, at Austin, Ft. Bliss and Camp
Owen Bierne at El Paso, Ft. Stanley

ALLIANCE BACKED IN
! MODERATOR ELECTION
ST. LOUIS, May 15. J. Willis
Baer, Pasadena, Calif., banker, late
today was elected moderator at th?
131st general assembly of the Pres
byterian churches in the United
States in session here. This is the
first time in history a layman was
chosen as the highest officer of the
church. Mr. Baer's opponent was the
Rev. Dr. S. Hall Young, an Alaskan
missionary.
The election resulted from the first
ballot, which, gave Mr.-Baer 476 votes
and Dr. Johnson 348.
Mr. Baer was the only layman nom
inated. William J. Brayan, w?io had been
spoken of frequently as a possible
contestant, did, not arrive in St. Louis
until after - the election. This . pre
cluded him from becoming a candi
dite, as the assembly has never chos
en a moderator who was not on the
floor at -the lime of the election.
.'"Mr. Baer is vice chairman of the
New Era movement, whoch has on
hand the raising of $3S,000,000 for
Presbyterian church work, and is for-

that of Jaggers $10,000.
mer associate of the board of home
missions. For many years he was
general secretary of the Christian En
deavor and is a former president of
Occidental College, Los Angeles.
He is also a member of the execu
tive committee of the Inter-Church
World movement, which plans the al
liance of all protestant churches.
The movement has been denounced
by many ministers at pre-assembly
gatherings, but many tonight express
ed belief that Mr. Baer's election to
the moderatorship might bring about
endorsement of the movement by the
assembly. Mr. Haer tonight refused
to discuss the stand he would take on
the question.

The Sunny Side of Life
.'he most dangerous time in a man's career is when the sun has
passed the mid-day of his life and this time may come anywhere
. sen 30 and 60.
t's the time when he gets careless about the way he eats and dresses,
vhen, because of this, his growing children begin to lose their respect
im.
t's the time when he stops reading Looks and poetry, and when
c no longer interests him, and he becomes commonplace in his
;ing and speaking. He feels that he's getting old and that he
help it, and so he drifts into a "what's the use" attitude toward new
58- 4
It's the time of questioning. Things that he always accepted sud
V lose their foundation and he staggers about, trying to find some
; to stand on. Creeds and customs are no longer accepted just be
e others believe in them. ,
It's the time of disappointment. The plans and purposes and dreams
outh have been smashed, and not much seems real and permanent,
ideals .have not been realized, and usually he blames others rarely
elf.
It's the time when bitterness and cynicism creep in and when the
it of confidence and co-operation are pushed out. Selfishness which
outh is due to thoughtlessness now becomes systematic and chronic.
When the sun burns at midday it's the plant that has no root which
. lers away and that's what makes a man's spirit dry up.
It's because during his ycunger days he failed to strike deep down
the roots of life, so that later he mrght draw strength and nourish
t from the things which are eternal and true.
"Love never faileth, said the sacred writer. "But whether there
prophecies, they shall fail; whether there be tongues, they shall
whether there be knowledge, it shall vanish away
"And now bideth faith, hope, love, and these three; but the greatest
hese is love."
And love here means the desire for others' good so that fundament-
the way to keep young and strong is to work in a whole-souled fash

Why We're Enjoying It Again
I
! Say, do you know why all of us are enjoying baseball so much more
n we have been for the past two years? Listen.
There's no come-back to it now.
. There's no uneasy feeling that players and spectators might all be
ng important things such, for instance, as digging trenches or firing
ee-inch guns or cutting barbed wire out beyond the front lines while
6hells shrieked overhead and the rat-pat of the machine guns sounded
e the death rattle of civilization in our ears.
i There's no feeling now that we shouldn't be there, "whooping it up
'r the home team, scattering peanut shells around until the floor of the
, .indstand looks like it had the rash, and getting sun-burned and being
irpy in the good old way. k
j That's why baseball has come back. 1
J It's a regular man's sport now, a regular man's recreation once more,
j And say, fans, isn't it good to get out there again with the pop boys
. Jling gum and pop and alleged smokes same as ver?
f Isn't it great to feel that it is really important to have the home
jam win?
j Isn't it a nifty little sensation to take an interest in batting averages
id box scores?
; On the level, hasn't it been a good thing to have baseball in a state
: hiatus as 'twere for the past two seasons?
It makes us appreciate it so much more now that k has come back.
, It makes us realize that we have the times of our young, or not so
Jung lives, cut there on the old lot cussing the umpire and making
ise cracks about "inside" stuff.
I Baseball! Man, that's going to be the middle name for a lot cf us
lis summer!
Pennies Appreciated
Who said pennies were obsolete? The government mints and .-ul-reasuries
are flooded with orders for one-cent pieces. The mints are
crking overtime, almost exclusively on pennies. Their present output
2,000.000 a day. The ceins are shipped to the big financial centers bv
he carload, and distributed among the. banks by the bushel, and still
hey cannot get enough.
There were hundreds of millions in circulation before the rush
tarted. There are more red cents passing around right now than ever
efore. And yet there is a penny famine.
The immediate cause s the new "soda water tax" that went ir.to
-ffect on the first day of May. along with other "luxury taxes." Everv
lish of ice cream and every glass of soda water or other soft drink in
volves the payment of a war tax, and that calls for a pennv in addition
.o the customary nickel or dime. .The demand was already abnormal be
fore, largely on account of the pennies required for the moving picture
tax. It seems to have been stimulated, too. by the rise in the price of
one-cent newspapers to two cents.
So we have the odd contradiction of the demand for the cent growing
as its purchasing value diminishes. It is not merely a matter of con
venient change-making. Newsboys ay they do not get a nickel for a two
cent paper as they u.ed to for a one-cent paper. People may waste dol
lars, but they cherish the pennies.
Charlie Roberts failed to secure $;)0.0o0,000 state highway bonds to
be expended by supervisors of counties; he failed to secure authority to
levy an extra mill tax in counties but is not discoursed and is now trv
ing to put over a $1,200,000 bond issue in Oo hise county and from the
way the Bolsheviki are falling for his medicine, it looks as if he niicht
yet get away with it. Tucson Citizen.
Charlie Roberts is leading those unsophisticated Douglas boosters
for his bonds to a good trimming. Sonx- tf;.y they will awake to find a
main line highway through from Tu son to Lonlsburg by way of Wilkox
and 1 enson and Douglas will he on a side track. Tucson Citizen.
Gelatine dnaniite used in the May Day l.omis was of American
manufacture, but no one be'.ices thai the things who made the boinbo
were of American manufacture.
Communism will continue epidemic, in Europe as long as some fiery
fool can persuade the people to forget about tomorrow.
InMcad of using twelve millions of stolen marks to feed tho hungry.
Bcla Ki;n spent it in a sreat celebration. That youncpter w ill make "a
statesman yet.
The communist brethren declare that they will make a success' of it
yet if they can-hire the able nen they kicked out to take charge again,
i .
World brotherhood would win more converts it" it could cmrtomc
that playful indulgence in homicide.

Mr. Hirsch, w ho has had consider
able experience in the mining game,
it is understood has been chosen by
the stockholders to report upon the
workings and the possibilities of the
property, which is equipped for the
deep mining necessary to reach the
vein of silver-copper and gold indi
cated in the claims.
On an adjoining property, Ted Kel

Wednesday 1:1 an order from Capt.
Charos 15. B. Bubb, 17th CavJlry. dis
trict adjutant, to Deputy United States

substituted the following;
"Permits will be required for the re
ceipt and sale of all guns and ammuni
tion except shotgun shells loaded w ith
No. 4 shot or under, and .22 caliber
low-power cartridges."
This practically reinstates the em

IN BURKBURNETT
No one can appreciate the wild excitement that there is
in l.URKBURNETT and WICHITA FALLS today unless they
are actually on the ground. We haven't had time to answer
inquiries about stocks by letter on this, the TREMENDOUS
ADVANCING MARKET even wire communication is too
SLOW. You must follow a good Broker, member of a re
liable exchange, and wire your orders to that broker, and you
SHOULD wire money to cover your purchases.
It seems almost impossible- to advise a client wrong when
you advise them to BUY ANY OF THE NORTHWEST
BURKBURNETT stocks.
TEXAS CONTROL
is a buy right now while you can buy it at $1.00 a share.
Here is a wire that makes the stock WORTH $2.00:
"Wichita Falls, Texas. 9:30 a. m. Dunbar & Com
pany: Gold Leaf in. Block 66 offset tiug one of the
Texas Control holdings in Block 65 is selling here
6 to 1. P. J. McKEOWN."
TEXAS CONTROL
also has a well on the sand in the HAYDEN BURK Tract in
NORTHWEST BURKBURNETT. These shares should, be'
picked up at a dollar.
OSAPLE-BURK selling at $20.00 is reported today to
have a 900-barrel well. It is a good buy for a $10.00 profit.
KING 8, in Block S4. is practically on the sand and now
down 1,620 feet, are doing a little fishing for tools at the
present time. Their wells ought to be in in the next ten
days. Par value $1.00 and selling around $10.00.
JAGGERS-WALLACE '
Selling at $3.00 to $3.25 today looks as if it would be the
SENSATIONAL stock of Texas. Arizona and New- Mexico.
The following telegram from our own man on the field veri
fies the facts as to the Company's FOURTH PRODUCING
WELL IN THE BURKBURNETT FIELD: "Wichita Falls
Texas. May 13, 1919. Dunbar & Company: Jaggers-Wallaie
Well No. tour is making close to 1,000 barrels. (Signed) P.
J. McKEOWN." JAGG ERS-WALIACE production prior t
the bringing in of this well, including their production in tho
Ranger field, amounted 1o close to 2,000 barrels. This added
production brings it up to 3,000 barrels daily.
The JAGGERS-WALLACE holdings in tho IU'RKBUR.
NETT fields are 5 acres in Block S6. next to Burk-Waggoner;
20 acres in Block 71, SO acres in. Block 101 and 102 acres in
the Ranger field. This does not include their Oklahoma
holdings.
The Company's dividend rat.? at the present time is 20
per cent. It has been confirmed that this rate will be in
creased to stockholders of record the latter part of this
month. One of the most sensational dividends ever paid by
an oil company is to be declared by the JAGGERS-WAl-LACE
OIL COMPANY. We anticipated in putting our
clients, all of them, into this stock at $2.00. but the news was
made public through another brokerage house and the result
is that our clients are paying f today's market price for
the stock and those who do not telegraph their orders will
pay $1 and $." for JAGGERS-WALLACE.
There isn't a question but that you want stink in this
big dividend payer and in our estimation those who acquire
it under $5 are buying it cheap.
PRUDENTIAL PETROLEUM
in Block Sri will be oversold nt $1.50 within the next few days.
There is less than 5.000 shares that can be bought at anv
iv. Willi; AT OUU EXPENSE.

SELF POISONING

AUTO-INTOXICATION, OR SLOW
SELF POISONING, CAUSE OF
MOST ILL HEALTH AND
DISEASE
Advanced medical authorities assert
that autointoxication is the founda
tion of most of the ills and diseases to
which the human flesh is heir.
This condition is nothing more nor
less than the slow self-poisoning of
the vital organs produced by the ex
cessive mental and physical strain
whie hwe are forced to endure, which
renders the organs lame and inactive1,
and permits toxins actual poison
to be generated within one's own
body.
I'sually the trouble starts iu the in
testines; sometimes it starts in the
stomach, liver, or kidneys, but in any
case me oume ues n tne iauuycu.

John Gregovich, U. S. Navy
Yeoman, Back From 20
Months' Service
r
HIGHWAY TO BENSON
IN FINE CONDITION
J. C. Ryan, highway engineer, mo
tored to Benson yesterday in connec
tion with road work. Mr. Ryan said
that a road gang is now engaged near
Benson dragging and levelling and
that when completed the road will be
in. good condition for automobile traf
fic. The work of pouring cement oh
the Bisbee-Douglas highway is also
progressing well, according to Engi
neer Ryan, who said that between
400 and 500 feet of cement work Is
laid every day and that the cement
paving is already two miles in length.
Under the present contract the pav
ing at the Douglas end will cover ten
miles of road and on Monday, May 26,
the contractors will begin pouring
cement on the four mile stretch from
this end. The paved road will add
materially to the pleasures of auto
mobile riding between the two cities
and the highway commission are hop
rug that arrangements can be made
to pave the entire road.
The most exciting incident he wit
nessed during his service in the Uni
ted States navy was the sinking of a
larj.e British transport off the coast
of France, according to Yeoman John
Gregovich, who returned home this
week after an absence of 20 months.
"The Britisher was one of a num
ber of ships that were being convoyed
and without any noticeable warning
we hoard a terrific explosion and then
saw that one of our company had been
torpedoed," said Gregovich. "Al
though the victim of the submarine
sank in comparatively short time,
most of the survivors were picked up
by convoys, but it wa3 impossible to
save all of them owing to the" high
sea which was running at the time.
When it was ascertained that every
man possible had been rescued we
continued our journey to France with
out any further mishap."
Gregovich, who entered the navy
service at the age of IS, was sent to
Mare Island, Calif., where he received
bis preliminary training. This country
at the lime of his enlistment'had only
been in the war one day and he was
anxious to get into action. His first
trip was to Dunkirk. France, which
trip he made on the General Gothals.
UpoH -his arrival in France he was
sent to the naval air station where he
remained for eight months.
After leaving Dunkirk he made sev
eral ocean voyages, during which any
especial excitement was conspicuous
by its absence. Gregovich said he
was pleased with life in the navy but
as soon as the armistice was signed
he longed for private life again. An.
other brother, Mark, who was only 16
years old when he entered the navy,
is now in the service but expects to
be discharged soon, according to a let
ter received here. Gregovich said he
expects to settle down in Bisbee again
as it looks good to him after his life of
activity in the navy.

SEVEN
LINE PLAN FOR
NOT NEW, HRSHT CHANCE TO SUCCEED
BY RICHARD SPILLANE
Most Noted Financial Writer in Amer
ica, and Special Economics Contri
butor the Daily Review.
Money, it has been said. is the root
of all evil. Therefore, in curing the
ills from which Russia suffers. Lenine
proposes to abolish mouy.
His method has the merit of novel
ty. He plans to make money so plen
tiful that it will be worthless. The
printing presses are busy turning out
paper roubles as fast as men and ma
chines can, print them.
Other governments have made their
money valueless, but not deliberate
ly. Of comparatively recent time you
could buy a $10 bill of one of. the
.Mexican governments for one cent
and a $100 note for a nickel. In the
closing days or the Confederacy $5000
in paper money was paid for a pair
of boots and. at that, the seller of the
boots got the worst of It.
He'd Make Production the
Measure of Reward
When Lenine has flooded Russia
with money so that its debasement
makes it rediculous he plans to intro
duce the communistic Ideal of valua
tion the production of the worker be
ing ttoe standard, the basis, on which
all goods are to be measured. Land,
mills, shops, everything being held in
common he intends each worker shall
be entitled to credit or reward accord
ing to his product. For a day's work
a laborer in the field, in the factory,
in the office shall have the equivalent
in credit to obtain what he desires
from the communistic store. For ex
ample: If a day's work is establish
ed as being the equivalent of 10 points
the worker may get from any govern
ment store articles aggregating in
value 10 points. If he takes articles
of a value of 5 points there will re
main to his credit 5 points. All
prices are to be regulated by the
government. No one is to be paid
more for a day's work than another
person unless his production is great
er. A foreman or superintendent is
to be rated the same as the laborer
and receive the same reward. All per
sons are to be equal. Only those who
are slothful or who fall behind the
established amount of a day's work
are to receive less than the common
rate of pay or credit.
It Is the belief of Lennine that
this system -will stifle greed and end
the exploitation of the common manj
by the clever or the crafty man and
prevent the accumulation of power
or wealth in the hands of the few.
Hires Financiers to
Worw Out His Scheme
Believing the end justifies the
means, he is employing the most
skillful of accountants and the most
experienced of actuaries to work out
the system by which it is to be oper
ated. These men are not of the Bol
shevist, but of the bourgoise class and
their compensation, it 13 said, is not
based on the communistic rate but
the old and abhorred one of paying a
man according to his talents.
What chance has such a plan
as that of Lenine for success?
NONE!
It is not new.
It dates back to pre-histor'e
time before money, as we know
money, was known and when men
bartered things of which they had
a surplus, such as the skins of
animals, for the things other men
had and which they craved or of
which they had use.
Because the method was crude it
had to be improved. Something had
to be introduced that would be a
medium of valuation not only between
one man and another man or one tribe
and another, but between all. So a
token a metal token which we call
money came into use. And later,
when man, in his enterprise, needed
more in some undertaking than he
actual money to purchase he pledged
his good name or his reputation ana
fo there came the institution we term
credit.
Money, actual money, is metal.
Gold, being rare, has been held in
hish esteem. Silver, being more
plentiful, is rated lower.
Today, if we had to depend upon
metalic money alone in the transac
tion of the world's affairs, there would
be chaos. In all the world there is
only $9,000,000,000 of coined gold or
gold in bars. The amount of silver
coined or in fl-zn Is but $3,000,000,000.
So, it is that if the coins or markers
were to be used exclusively there
would not be enough in the world to
pay for much more than one-half of
the farm products of America alone
this year of 1919.
Communism Won't Work
in One Country Alone
The world's business is conducted
on credit. Superinimposed on the re
latively small base of gold and silver
is a towering structure of promise
a pledge in evidence of which a
piece of paper is given. That is the
bank note, the bill of exchange, the
mortgage and all the ramified forms
of indebtedness.
Lenine says the world must be
wholly non-communistic. In other
words, one communistic government
cannot stand alone. He is right. For
h's plan to have chance of success,
ABOLISHING M0SEW5L 555 "SL
all governments must do as he is in
tending Russia shall as.
Will they do it? No sane person
would answer affirmatively.
If the experiment of commun
ism ever is to be tried out in a
b'g way it probably is well the ex
periment should be made now and
in Russia. No great nation offers
such advantages to the commun
ist and no man has a better op
portunity than Lenine
He realizes this fact. He says Rus
sia is agricultural and its wealth is
of the earth, not of the -factory. He
proposes that Russia shall feed Eu
rope and Europe shall furnish to Rus
sia the goods Russia requires. He has
started to restore the agricultural
wealth of Russia by increasing the
production per acre. In order to do
this he has taken over the manitnoib
agricultural implement plants. Few
Americans appieciate that Ki!.-;sia is
far ahead of any other European coun
try in this department. The Interna
tional Harvester company has eight
big establishments in Russia. its
Moscow plant is as big almost as its
biggest in America. Last year it
charged off to profit and loss the $21,
000,000 its Russian plants had cost.
Horses and cattle are scarce in Rus
sia today owing to the war. Lenine
means to make the machine to do
work of the farm. He means also to
increase the production of wheat
greatly thereby. Russia in normal
times averaged nine bushels to the
acre. Recently it has fallen to five
bushels to the acre. It is possible
to increase production to 15 bushels
within a few years.
Means Bringing All Men
to a Very low level "
The richest farm land in Europe is
in the Ukraine. The sugar produc
tion there could supply most of Eir
rope if tha disorder ended and men
got back to work. The Caucuses is an
agricultural wonderland, but is as
backward as Africa. Parts of Siberia
offer large opportunity agriculturally
and otherwise.
In his scheme of building Russia
up from the foundation of the farm
Lenine is wise but otherwise his pro
ject is crazy. It can bring nothing
but chaos. It means the bringing of
all men to one levels a very low
level. It means death to enterprise,
initiative," development. It means
suppression to ambition and almost
to aspiration. It means turning back
the world to the age of crudity.
Russia has the reputation of being
the most graft ridden land in the
world. Craft is an established institu
tion, recognized, accepted and not con
sidered bad form. What opportunity

to enter this paradise should start at
one to avoid the rush.

with all factories, farms, stores and

the Utopia Lenine holds out to view.

PLANES HELP BRITISH
: IN SWEEPING MINES
LONDON", May 15. Sweeping up
the thousands of mines which strew
the seas in the neighborhood of the
British Isles has proved such a costly
and dangerous job when carried on
by the ordinary methods, that the ad
miralty has turned to the airship for
relief. Experiments conducted in the
North Sea, it is announced, have been
successful, mines being located and
exploded much quicker than when the
usual mine-sweeping ship is used.
While the airship has the advant
age of height in locating mines, the
mere fact that an airship cannot hit
a mine adds so much to the element of
safety that it is expected that much
of tho 5,000 square miles of mine
strewn waters which remain will be
cleared without loss of life.

HOW AMERICA SAVED !
RUMANIANS FROM
STARVING REVEALED
BELGRADE, Serbia, April 23. (By
Mail) "AU Rumania is eating Hour
from America today. The people real
ize where the aid has come from and
are exceedingly grateful, without
American help starvation certainly
would have become very general."
These are the words of Lieutenant
Colonel H. Gideon Wells, American
Red Cross commissioner to Rumania,
who recently arrived at Belgrade from
Bucharest.
Colonel Wells said the great bulk
of the Rumanian food supply, includ
ing about twenty thousand tons of
.flour monthly, is furnished by the
American food administration. It is
sold ii wholesale quantities to the
govr-----.icnt, -which attends to all Re
tails of transport and distribution.
Flour trains run continually from the
ports to the interior and have the
right of way over all other transport
The supply is being well handled and
there is no longer danger of starva
tion except in isolated areas, particu
larly in the Dobrudja region, where
local transport is excessively diffi
cult. Supplementary to the food admin
istration program the American Red
Cross commission to Rumania ha4 al
ready developed a nation-wide food
and clothing program which aims par.
ticularly at the relief of the desti
tute, the welfare of orphans, the or
ganization of sewing rooms and the
general amelioration of conditions.
This effort has had the hearty co-operation
of the Rumanian government.
From King Ferdinand . and Queen
Marie to the last clerk, the Rumanian
people are very grateful, and "to be
an American is to be honored."
The commisison to Rumania has 54
members, about evenly divided be
tween men and women. Lieutenant
Colonel H. Gideon Wells is commis
sioner and general director. The &om
mission is the creation of the commis
sion to the Balkan States which now
has headquarters at Rome, and of
which Colonel Henry Anderson of
Richmond, Va., is the commissioner-in-chief.
The general program of the
Balkan commission, already effective
ly applied in Siberia, Rumania,
Greece, Albania and Montenegro is
one. of emergency relief.
The commission to Serbia operates
southward from Belgrade and north
ward from Salonikf, under direction of
Lieutenant-Colonel Thomas W. Far-1
nam of New Haven, Conn. -

THEY STAND THE TEST
OF HARD WEAR
4275 miles is the distance walked by
II. M. Foreman on one pair of Neolin
Soles. Mr. Foreman, who is a postman
in Atlentown, Pa., says "The shoes with
Neolin Soles gave me continuous serv
ice for 9'A months, during which time
I averaged 18 miles a day. Ordinary
soles last me about one month."
If you are hard on shoes, follow Mr.
Foreman's example and buy them with
Neolin Soles. These soles are created
by Science to be especially tough and
durable. Therefore. Neolin-soled shoes
wear a long time, and so cut your shoe
bills down. Good shoe 6tores carry
them in many styles for men, women,
and children.
And have your old shoes re-bottomed
with Neolin Soles. Remember they
are comfortable and waterproof, also.
Neolin Soles are made by The Good
year Tire & Rubber Co., Akron, Ohio,
who make Wingfoot Heela guaranteed
to outwear all other heels.

VENEZUELA FACTIONS
REUNITED BY INVASION
WASHINGTON, May 15 Official
advices reaching Washington today
said the recent attempted invasion of
Venezuela by an armed force led by
Ernesto Liveron, has effected a re
organization of the political oppo
nents of the present administration.
Many of the political opponents or
General Gomez, president-elect, the
dispatches said, have told him that
now they will support his administra
tion, and patriotic demonstrations
have been held in Caracas and other
cities in favor of General Gomez and
provisional President Bustillos.

WASHINGTON, May 15. Even in
America "the greatest builder of the
past," no feat of construction has ever
approached that involved in the com

for the ntaional army and 16 tent

The creature comforts enjoyed by
the American soldiers of 1917 is con-;
trasted with those afforded the men of i
'61-'65. Substantial barracks, heated !
by steam or stoves, took the place j
of tents; chemically pure water re-
placed that secured from the casual !
spring or stream; scientific laundries
cared for the national army recruit's
clothing, and field bakeries gave him
the modern successor to the ashy hoe

Lumber used v in the cantonments
aloae,' the report says, was equivalent
to a board-walk 12 inches wide and
one, inch thick "to the moon and half
way back" while the nails of one
popular size would "girdle the earth
three and a half times."
The race between the contractors
to complete the cantonments in the
time for the initial draft is eloquently
described, the builder of Camp Taylor,
Louisville, Ky., winning by a narorw
margin. The cantonments occupied
167,741 acres of land, which cost an
average of $3.93 per acre, and the con
tractors' profits were given as less
than 2 1-2 per cent of the gross cost
of construction.
Expenditures for the cantonments
represented 70 per cent of the total for
the' Panama canal, but the time con
sumed was less than 90 days against
10 years for the canal. Supplemen
tary building projects undertaken by
the department aggregated a much
larger project than the cantonments
and Included enormous storehouses,
factories for various purposes, proving

GIRL OF MY DREAMS'
AT EAGLE THEATER
LAST TIME TODAY
Miss Billie Rhodes, who is starred in
the Affiliated production, "The Girl of
My Dreams," at the Eagle theater to
day, finds herself more satisfactorily
placed in this clever story of love in
the hills than in any previous role.
The story was written by Wilbur
Nesbit, author of more heart-to-heart
stuff in the American newspapers and
magazines than any poet or prose
writer of his time, whose "Your Flag
and My Flag" is a classic of war-time
verse.
Cast as "The Weed," a beautiful lit
tle mountain girl, innocent of conven
tions and contemptuous of "the rags
of civilization," Miss Rhodes is afford
ed the opportunity to display her real
ly amazing versatility, and the char
acterization is one that is certain to
add vastly to her well-earned fame. .
"The Girl of My Dreams" is a love
story, of course, but it is a love story
tha,t has a good hearty laugh in it here
and there, or pretty Billie would have
to get some fun out of life even n
she were dying of love. The beauty of
this story is that it is natural and not
tearful. Adv.
