Attorney General Says Way
Will Be Found to Make
Operators "Keep Faith"
SAYS NEW STRIKE IS
TO BE- EXPECTED
Frelinghuysen Denounces
"Purchase of Obedience
tc the Law"
WASHINGTON. Dec. 22. Senatoi
Frelinghuysen, chairman of the sen
ate committee investigating the coal
situation, in a formal statement - to
night declared that in the govern
ment's negotiations "there must have
been some sort of a secret deal made
in addition to the signed statement."
Senator Frelinghuysen reviewed
the testimony adduced by the com
mittee hearings to date and added
that out oi the settlement of tht.
trike, "in any event the public may
look for an increase in the price of
coal or another strike." .
The New Jersey senator character
ized the settlement proposition as put
forth by Attorney General Palmer
and accepted by the miners as
loaded dice for the American pub
lic." Attorney General Palmer, in a
statement tonight denied the aesei
tions made yesterday by the oper
ators -whose position he characteriz
ed as "the merest quibble and quite
unworthy of the representatives of a
great industry.
Contradicts Operators
"Their allegation now," continueu
Mr. Palmer, "that they were not con
sulted about the form of the memor
andum, "which was submitted to the
miners' conference, is absurd."
-"The government,7 will. not assume
that the operators will -break faith,
and, indeed, ways " will be found to
keep faith in this vital important
transaction. The commission will
proceed with its work and I have no
doubt that upon further reflection
.the operators will see the wisdom of
hearty cooperation with it."
Praising the stand taken by Dr. H.
A. Garfield, who recently resigned as
fuel administrator because of the
disagreement with the strike eettle
.ment. Senator Frelinghuysen said:
"The present plan, which incurred
the hostility of Dr. Garfield and
caused his resignation, is acceptable
to the miners because it opens the
rtnnr to further demands and further
wage increases, which the public J
must Day. The miners are expecuns
that additional raise as a result of
this agreement.
-There must have been some se
cret deal, in addition to the signed
agreement. In any event, the public
may look for an increase in the price
of coal or another strike.
"There was a vital principle In
volved in this contest, and that was
i-nered in the settlement or mis
strike, namely, shall the law be bu
preme or shall an organization, a
class, hold itself above the law. and
refuse obedience thereto, when its
selfish interests come in conflict with
the public good?
"It will be a sad day for America
if obedience to the law must be pur
chased in this manner. I am opposed
to such a proposition and I believe
the American people are opposed to
i:."

in the Mexican situation.
"Every ten days,' h charged,'
"shiploads of trained and armed

Declares Pershing
Unfit for Election
to the Presidency
MINNEAPOLIS. Dec. 22. Repre
sentative Thomas D. SchaU of Min
nesota, denounced General John J.
Pershing, In an address today. He
declared that General Pershing is
seeking the presidency of the United
States and is "absolutely unfit for
the office."
"I have felt it my duty to do what
I could to thwart the ambitions of
this man," he said. Representative
Schall was the only member of con
gress to vote against conferring the
full rank general on General Persh
ing. My objection to reirarding Persh
ing with a full generalship was not
that it would foster militarism, but it
would be rewarding an unworthy of
ficer, an un-American, unrepresenta
tive officer."
Mr. Schall said General Pershing
was "inhuman and cruel," and that he
censored information that went from
France to America to his own Advant
age. He also attacked General Persh
ing for his alleged "snub" of the con
gressional committee that went to
France.

"Either I have to vindicate the law
or abdicate in favor of Mr. Howat."
The hearing this morning began
with' a response by Henry Warrum,
chief counsel &o- the United Mine

position was taken that Howat, in
kpeping in force a local strike of
1000 miners in the Kansas district,
which was called last July, did not
violate the injunction against furth

Marshal J. P. Dillon today made pub
lic details of the capture of James
Pruitt, former saloon keeper at Win
kelman, who was apprehended last
Friday in a mountainous region near
Mammoth, Ariz., on a bench warrant
issued by Judge William H. Sawtelle
of the United States district court.
Marshal Dillon said Pruitt and Lee
Marvill had been operating a distil
lery at their mountain hiding place.
Pruitt was arrested at Nogales last
August on a warrant charging viola
tion of the federal law in connection
with the smuggling and sale of nar
cotics from Mexico. He was releas
ed on $3000 bond and delayed the
trial by asking that Marvill be sought
as witness.
The case was called for trial last
month. The government presented
its evidence at a morning session and
the court recessed at noon. When it
reconvened Pruitt was missing.
The still was located after a 30

him for a felony. What should I do

During the outline of the govert

clared that during thirty three months

YUMA, Ariz., Dec. 22. Professor
Dean Working and Professor F. J.
Ciider of the University of Arizona
were in Yuma recently and while
here gave out the 'good news that
work of Improvement would' begin at
once on the new mesa experimental
farm. This farm consists of 160
acres given to the university by the
United States government and lies
just north of Unit B on the mesa
which has just been sold.
. Proressor Working said that they
would pump their own water
from the main -YtuiTa canal un-l

Idea is to have water on this tract J ln
by the first of March and to plant a Y

spring. They will get power for
pumping from Yuma Ice, Electric and
Manufacturing company.
The rapid development of this land
will Increase the value ot all mesa
lands which have been sold. "
SHORT SKIRTS AND
ETONS, SPRING STYLE
CLEVELAND, Ohio, Dec. 22.
Skirts for the spring and summer of
1920 will be "frankly short but with
out abbreviation," as the style creat
ors themselves express it. At a gar
ment 'convention held in Cleveland
the other day the 18th annual con
vention of the National Suit. Coat, and
Skirt Manufacturers association
this prediction was made and like
wise illustrated at the style parade
which concluded the convention.
Sport suits and coats, too, are be
ing designed in increasingly large
numbers and varieties of colors and
material combinations, to meet the
constantly growing demand for this
sort of outdoor garb. The skirts of
the sports suits are straight and sim
ply cut, say the designers. A clever
touch of trimming is sometimes added
to correspond wiUi the jacket trim
ming. Many of the misses' skirts design
ed for wear with the short, boxy
coats or Eton jackets . which will bo
exceedingly popular, are to have a
"peg" suggestion.. They are made on
high bodice belts. A three-piece suit
effect is planned for some of the
spring suits, with a bib-like arrange
ments in front forming a vest. The
tunic skirt is also to be shown with
this type of Jacket, ahd the plaited
skirt will not be discarded. The
styles . shown at the convention bore
out the manufacturers' statement that
women's skirts, during the coming
season, will be worn from seven
inches 'from ihe floor, and misses'
skirts, approximately ten inches from
the floor.

Cn his hunting trip into the south
west and Colorado, President Roose
velt was accorded a series of ova
tions such as only he could inspire.
He made many speeches, .few of
which were according to schedule.
His train was due to pass through
Temple, Tex., without stopping, but
the city council passed an emergency
ordinance compelling the train to re
main there three minutes. This
pleased the president. En route, he
delivered himself of many Roosevelt
ian epigrams, such as: "The honest
man who is a coward is of no earthly
use. to himself or anyone elce.". .
, What he does not relate in his l
ters home is that his guides in the
wild riding after the hounds, tried in
every way to prevent the president
from risking his neck. But even if
they rede around a dangerous spot,
the president would plunge through
determined to be in at' the death.
The Editor.
Abernethy the Wolf Hunter.
Colorado SpringB, Colorado, -Glenwood
Springs, Colorado,
April 20, 1905.
DEAR TED: -
1 do wish you could have been
along on this trip. It. has been great
fun. In Oklahoma our party got all
told seventeen coyoteB with the grey
hounds. I was in at the death cu
eleven, the only ones started by the
dogs with which I happened to be.
In one run the three Easterners cov
ered 'themselves with glory, as Dr.
Lambert, Roly Fortescue and I were
the only ones who got through ex
cepting Abernethy, the wolf hunter.
It happened because it was a nine
mile run and all the cdwboys rode
their horses to a standstill in the
first three or four miles, after which
I came bounding along, like Kermit
in the paper chase, and got to tht
end in time to see the really remark
able feat of Abernethy jumping on
the wolf, thrusting his gloved hand
into its mouth, and mastering it then
and there. He never used a knife
or a rope in taking these wolves,
seizing ihem by sheer quickness and
addresand thrusting his hand into
the wolfs mouth in such a way that
U lost all power to bite. You would
have loved Tom Burnett, the son of
the big cattle man. He is a splendid
fellow, about thirty years old, ana
just the ideal of what a young cattle
maa should be.
Up here we have opened well. We
have two cracker-jacks as guides
John Goff, my old guide on the moun
tain lion hunt, and Jake Borah, who
has somewhat the Seth Bullock type
of face. We, have about thirty dogs,
including one absurd little terrier
about half Jack's size, named Skip.
Skip trots all day long with the
hounds, except when he can persu
ade Mr. Stewart, or Dr. Lambert, or
me to take him up for a ride, for
which he is always begging. He is
most affectionate iind intelligent, but
when there is a bear or lynx at bay
he joint in the fight with ail the fury
of a bull dog, though I do not think
he is much more effective than one
of your Japanese mice would be. 1
should like to bring him home for
Archie or Quentin. He would go
everywhere with them aii would
ride Betsy or Algonquin.
On the third day out I got a fine
big black bear, an old male who
would not tree, but made what they
call in Mississippi a walking bay with
the dogs, fighting them off all the
time. The chase lasted nearly two
hours and was ended by a hard
scramble up a canyon side; and I
made a pretty good shot at him as
he was walking off with the pack
around him. He will one dog and
crippled three that I think will re
cover, besides scratching others. My
30-40 Springfield worked to perfection
on the bear.
I suppose you are now in the thick
ot your studies and will have but
little time to rest after tme examina
tions. I shall be back about the 18th,
and (then we can take up our tennis
again. Give my regards to Matt.
; I ani particularly pleased that
Maurice turned out so weTL He has
always been , so pleasant to me that
I had hoped he would turn out all
right in the end.
Prairie Girls.
. Divide Creek, Colo.,
April 26, 190.).
DARLING ETHEL:
Of course you remember the story
of the little prairie girl. 1 always
associate it with you. Well, again
and again on this trip we would pass
through prairie villages bleak and
lonely with all the people in from
miles about to see me. Among tiiem
were often dozens of young girls,
often pretty, and so far tfs I could see
much more happy than the heroine
of the story. One of them shook
hands with me, and then, after much
whispering, said: "We want to shake
hands with the guard ! " The "guard"
proved to be Roly, who was very
swell in his uniform, and whom they
evidently thought much more attrac
tive than the President, both in age
and looks.
There are plen'y of ranchmen
roun-i here; they drive over to camp
to see me, -usually bringing a cake,
or some milk and eggs, and are very
nice and friendly. About twenty of
the men came out with me, "to see
the President shoot a bear"; and for
tunately I did so in the course of an
exhaustive twelve hours' ride. I am
very homesick for you all.
Bears, Bobcats and Skip.
Glenwood Springs, Colo.,
May 2, 1903.
I was delighted to get your letter.
I am sorry you are having such a
hard time in mathematics, but hope
a oosple of weeRs will set you all
right. We have had a very success
ful hunt. All told we have obtained
ten bear and three bobcats. Dr. Lam
bert has been a perfect trump. He
is in the pink of condition, while for
the last week I have' ben a little
knocked out by the Cuban fever. Up
to that time I was simply in splendid
shap. There is a very cunning little
dog named Skip, belonging to John
Goff's pack, who has completely
adopted me. I think I shall take him
him to Archie. He likes to ride on
Dr. Lambert's horse, or mine, and
though he is not as big as Jack, takes
eager part in the fight with every
bear and bobcat.
I am sure you will enjoy your trip
to Deadwood with Seth Bullock, and
as soon as you return from Groton I
shall write to him about it. I have
now become very homesick for
mother, and shall be glad when the
12th of May comes and I am back in
the White House.
Home Again With Skip
White House, May 14, 1903.
DEAR KERMIT:
Here I am back again, and mighty
glad to be back. It was perfectly de
lightful to see mother and the chil
dren, but it made me very homesick
for you. Of course I was up to my
ears in work as soon as I reached
the White House, but in two or thre
days we shall bo through it and can
settle down into our old routine.
Yesterday afternoon we played ten
nis, Herbert Knox Smith and I beat
ing Matt and Murray, Today I shail
take cunning mother out for a ride.
Skip accompanied me to Washing
ton. He is not as yet entirely Ui
home in the White House and rather
clings to 'my companionship. I think
he will soon be fond of Archie, who
loves him dearly. Mother is kind to
Skip, but she does not think he is an
artistocrat as Jack is. He is very
cunning little dog all the same.
Mother walked with me to church
this morning and both the past even
ings we have been able to go out
into the garden and sit on the stone
benches near the fountain. The coun-j
try is too lovely for anything, every
thing being a deep, rich, fresh green.
I had a great time in Chicago wltn
the labor union men. They made
what I regarded as a rather insolent
demand upon me, and I gave them
some perfectly straight talk about
their duty and about the preservation
of law and order. The trouble seems
to be increasing there, and I may
have to send federal troops into the
city though I shall- not do bo unless
It is necessary.

THE ORPHANED RAILROADS
A REMARKABLE example of congressional efficiency, or congres
sional conscientiousness, or congressional concern over the grav
ity of national problems, or congressional something or other, is
presented in the anomalous situation confronting the railroads
of the country as a result of congressional adjournment over the
holidays Saturday .with railroad legislation still pending.
The senate passed the Cummins bill, paving the way for the re
turn of the railroads to private ownership, making the holiday re
cess possible, says the Associated Press, and then naively adds in
the same dispatch that the disposition of the railroad problem still
is in doubt owing to the fact that congress will be in recess on Janu
ary 1, the date set by President Wilson for the return of the roads
to their owners, while the Cummins bill has not yet passed the house.
The bill thus left "up in the air" provides for return of the
railroads on January 31, but the railroad administration, if Wilson
adheres to his program, will relinquish them on January 1. The
question naturally arises, what is to become of the railroads during
that month of apparent orphanage?
That government control of railroads has not been the pan
acea for transportation ills it was supposed to prove, few, if any,
will deny. The lumber industry of the Northwest, to take one
Instance, is said to be facing ruin because of a car shortage, after
two years of that government control which was supposed to remedy
such shortages.
Apparently it is the dec-ire of congress, in adjourning in the
midst of the railroad muddle, to keep the record consistent through
out. The senators and congressmen should worry over their Christ
mas dinners as to the status of the railroads in January. Shades
of Janice and Jarndyce, and of the Circumlocution Office. Haven't
the senators "made possible" the congressional Christmas vacation
by getting the Cummins bill half way to conference?

SIR OLIVER LODGE, ET ALS.
AMERICAN LEGION MASCOT
PHOENIX has risen in offended dignity and wrath to drive forth
from her sales the palmists, crystal gazers, clairvoyants and
other so-called "psychics" who trade on gullibility and illileiacy
The members ol the city .commission are skeptics, and are
planning to boost the license price of looking into the future and
beyond the giavc so high that even should Sir Oliver Lodge or l)r
James Hyslop come to the Arizona capital they would find it fin
ancially impossible to take even single extra-mundane peek.
hich is as it should be, for every little barrier such as this
thrown against the rising tide of post-war hysteria known as "spirit
Ism" does Its mite toward restoring humanity's mental fresh air.
The "clairvoyants" who accept fees for their supposed traffic
in "spirit communication" are for the most part vultures unscrup

They were perhaps never more popular, for the war has increased
mothers of sons slain in battle; and their shabby vaudevillism has
gained false prestige through the remarkable, apparently inexplicable,
but necessarily finite psychic phenomena which are daily being un
earthed by the American Society for Psychical Research and similar
institutions. .
A grave responsibility in all this rests upon Dr. Hyslop in Amer
ica, and Sir Oliver Lodge in Great Britain, the recognized leaders in
"spirit communication.'' Did these eminent thinkers but study the
psychic disclosures which have come under their observation, as
finite mtntal phenomena, they could do much good in the discovery
of new laws of mind to be used for the correction of insanity, crime
and mental defectiveness generally; instead of retarding the progress
of healthy, rational thought by making vulgar, materialistic attempts
to pierce the Infinite, which in their last analysis burlesque man's
noblest ideals both of God and Immortality.
SHADES OF GREAT EXPLORERS
CAPTAIN Sir John Alcock. the lirst human being to cross the At
lantic oeean in a nontop flight, has joined the shades of great.
Yesterday his plane fell at Rouen. France, as he was following
the Seine, and his spint was released by the breaking of his
body. Captain Alcock must surely have geeu greeted by the shades
of Columbus, Magellan, Wright, and others of the world's daring
hearts and pioneer minds.
His life was a modern adventure that will hold many a boy
breathless as he reads. He had probably spent more time in the
air than any other man, it is said. He joined the roynl naval air
service at the outbreak of the war and served with distinction in
the eastern campaigns. He assisted in the bombing of Constantinople
and gained the distinguished service cross. Toward the end of the
war ho fell no the hands of the Turks as a prisoner of war and
was released upon the signing of the armistice.
Aged only 27. he was the true 'English type. Arizona Gazette.
L
CAPITAL IS ALSO NECESSARY
THERE are a million men out of work in Belgium. Germany and
German Austria.ns are cursed by idleness. Newspaper reports
tell of it. returned travelers tell of it, and letters from Germans
to people living in America comment on the lack of employ
ment. And it. is .hie to lack of capital. If there were capital in Belgium
and Germany people could go to woik and prosnerity wu.ild come
back. But capital is shy and will not come out of its hiding place.
And yet wo curse capital in America and some of us talk about con
fiscating it. Capital is just, as necessary as labor. Both can be
abused and the u.o of both can be and are abused. What we need
is a belter understanding of both. Nebraska City Press.

the enthusiasm the ex-service men in

there should be one of the largest
gatherings of the local members for
any event excepting the war.
There will be appropriate seasonal

WASHINGTON What the Ameri
can Legion wants. the federal govern
ment to do for its members will soon
be known. Franklin D'Olier, Philadel
phia, commander of the legion, is
here and soon will appoint a commit
tee of five members of the legion to
draw up the bill that congress is to
be asked to pass. It is now acknowl
edged in Washington that the Lane
Moridell, Morgan and other soldiers'
aid bills are dead not because con
gress willed it so, but because the
Aerican Legion brushed them aside.
The members' of the committee to
draw up the bill must be members of
the legion," declared O'Olier, "and as
nearly as possible as representative
of the spirit of the legion."
D'Olier has a big task in finding
men with all these qualifications who
can afford to come to Washington
and spend perhaps a month studying
the question.
NEW USE FOR A QUARANTINE

During the epidemic in a small

THE LATEST HARD LUCK STORY.
(From the Pittsburg Chronicle-Telegraph)
The -small touring company 'had found business wretchedly bod.
At last, in the late hours of Sunday evening, the company reached the
city of its hopes. ,
The manager stepped from the train and gazed over the railway station
railings.
"What a glorious sunset!" he exclaimed, hoping thereby to raise the
tpirits of his company.
- "Guan," yelled a passing youngster, "that's the theatre burning down!"
FROM SUN TO SUN THE ONCE OVER
They are telling this one up in Flagstaff:
Bill, a well-known Flagstaff character, Is a notorious backslider in
church affairs. At rare intervals, however, he hears the still small voice,
and drops shamefacedly into a rear pew in one of the local churches.
Last week Bill unexpectedly dropped into a Thursday night prayer
meeting. The pastor, overjojyed at the lost sheep strayed back within the
fold, promptly called upon him By lame to lead in prayer.
"Now, Rev. ," said Bill to the pastor, in a voice of injured re
monstrance as lie slid awkwardly to his feet with the eyes of the congrega
tion turned expectantly upon him, "you know damn well 1 can't pray."

O. S. French, local boxing impressario and promoter, calls the attention
el' tne editor of Boiilabaisse to an unintentional oversight in the list of big
purses offered for the Jack Dempsey-Georges Carpentier world's heavyweight
championship contest, which were published on the sporting page of Sun
day's Review. No mention, French complains, was made of the $330,000
oiler which he lias been made to have the Dempsey-Carpentier argument
staged at N'nco
As "Sunshine Jim" "offroth bus offered $400,000 to have the bout staged
at Tia Juana, it i.: expected that bidding for the match will develop into a
duel between Coffroth end French, with these two master minds of the
r porting world eventually reaching the half million mark in their endeavors
to outbid each other.
With Tia Juar.a selected by Cofrroth, and French holding the Naco con
cession, it looks as if the world's championship might be decided on Mexican
soil. '
At any rate. Promoter French declares confidentially that there is con
siderable Mexican athletics connected with his offer, explaining that Mex
ican athletes are principally noted for throwing the bull.

B refuse Babe Ruth recognizes his exceptional ability as a ban player,
it Wii3 no trouble to convince him that he ought also to be a good prirze

remind him of Henry Ford, who thought because he was a good motor car
maker he would be a great success as an international statesman.

"How dos a fix subsist in winter?" asks Mr. John Burroughs, a young

Turning Back the Calendar
Seventeen Years Ago In Bisbee
A PLAINTIVE DITTY
Among the passengers on the ship
was a man who stuttered badly. One
day he hurried up to the captain and
started: "Th-th-the "
'Tm very busy now," interrupted
the captain. "Tell the mate here."
Cut the mate was also busy, and
the stutterer tiied everyone else in
sight without success. Finally he
came back to the captain.
"Lock here, man, sing it ! That's
the oniy way," urged the officer.
Whereat the man chanted in u
tragic, voice:
"Should aul acquaintance be forgot
and never brought to- mind? The
blooming cook fell overboard and iH
twenty miles behind."

After writing a couple of paragraphs at the head of his daily column
a writer on an eastern newspaper filled up the rest of the column with a

Possibly the apex of sarcasm was reached the other day when Jones
took his flivver to a repair shop and asked the man there what was the
best thing to do with it.
The repair man looked the car over in silence for several minutes, after
which he grasped the horn and tooted it.
"You've a good horn there," he remarked quietly, "suppose you jack it
up and run a new car under it."

PLANNING CHRISTMAS DINNER
In planning the Christmas dinner
don't forget that in just a week you
wiH be serving another holiday din
ner and that the more our palates are
tickled tho sooner food palls on us.
Try to have absolutely no left-overs
to work up. During the intermediate
week serve an old-fashioned boiled
dinner. You micht even attempt a
"dinner of herbs," anything to whet
the appetite and bring contrast to the
rich and "dressy" affairs that tradi
tion demands and that come so close
ly together.
If you have a bil of some sent t;i
grace the first feast order an espe
cially fine roast for the second. If
the size of your family -will warrant
it get a whole roast pig. There's
nothing more lucioii;, than a six-weeks-old
piggy stuffed and roasted.
Let him , make his apnearanrc with
a growing red apple in his nioulh.

Yes, this is Mrs. Pigeon. What do you want?

present development and production in that wonder
.land of oil will sink into insignificance.
American has over twenty separate tracts of rich
acreages in Homer Claiborne field, many neighbor

speculative vulues. The feverish rush now on, will
treble and quadruple these values.
In Burkbuinett, three holdings, worth a large

STSGE SET FOR
FAST FIGHTING
CHRISTIS Dm
Carpenters will be busy today anil
tomorrow constructing a new ring in
Warren Park for the boxing program
on Christmas afternoon in which
Frank Loughrey, the Philadelphia
Hearcat, will do battle with Kid Pal
mer, the welterweight champion of
the United States army, in the ten
round main event for the champion
ship of the southwest.
Seats will be arranged at the ring
side, in anticipation of a record crowd.
These seats will be arranged on a sew
plan, so as to give everyone a tull
view of the ring, with no interven
ing posts or other obstacles. Four
sections of chairs, twenty abreast,
will run straight back from each side
pf thf ring, instead of in the usual
amphitheater formation. The ring is to
be specially padded and constructed
of strong lumber.
Fans will be pleased to learn that
Al Williams of Douglas was yesterday
engaged by Promoter O. S. French to
referee all bouts. Williams has given
excellent satisfaction as third man in
the ring every time he has served
as such, both in Bisbee and Douglas.
The advance seat sale was brisk
yesterday and is expected to attain a
record figure by Wednesday. Pal
mer has the solid backing of Douglas
to win, and hundreds of his admirers
are expected up from the border city
to witness the bout. Palmer 13 ruling
a favorite, owing to ; his youth and
dash. All concede, however, that
Loughrey is a tough nut to crack and
many followers of the game figure that
his years of experience, his willing
ness to firade punch for punch with
younger opponents and his ability to
assimilate punishment will prove too
much for the army youngster. Pal
mer's most ardent supporters are mak
ing no talk concerning a knockout, all
who know him conceding that it is
practically an impossibility for any
man of hs weight to put the Philadel
phian to sleep.
Loughrey. vbo has fought such men
as Carpentier and the late Les D'Arcy
is training diligently, and is confident
that oo Christmas day he will add an
onther victim to the long list of box
ers whose aspirations tQward cham
pionship honors he has crushed.'
An added drawing card will be the
six-round special event, between John
ay. Meyer, the Bisbee welter, and
Young Banta of the Czar shaft. Banta
outweighs Meyer by ten pounds, but
has not the latter's, experience or
science. -In view of his superior
weight and his rushing tactics, the
fans ate looking for a gruelling battle,
with . Meyer forced ' to use. every re
source of ring craft to stave off his
aggressive opponent. ;

Now and then we hear of a fa
mous ballplayer cropping from the
brilliance of stardom at the close of
a season to rue dim regions of no
where at the start of a new year.
And the wagging tongues oil up an
explanation, blaming it onto the
bright lights of the winter months.
While the fans sit around the old
stove league circuit the idols of the
J bleacherites occasionally burn up the
midnight circuit.
But if anything is wrong with the
outfielding and hitting of George
Burns of the Giants, or the pitching
of Slim Sallee of the Reds, next
spring, don't listen to any such hu
mors. For here are Slim and George
down on the farm at Feesburg. O.,
bagging the nimble cottontail,
butchering the hogs, swapping base
ball reminiscences, eating Mrs. Sai
lee's home cooking and getting lots
of sleep. That is Burn's and Sallee's
idea of a real winter. When Slim
heard 'em singing "I iovo the Cows
IF yon are satisfied with any ordinary magazine, don't bother your
newsdealer to reserve a copy of Hearst's. Those alertly intelligent
people who demand 8 roagaitina far beyond the average will quickly

world's great writers, the thoughts of the world's great thinkers, don t

and chickens BUT This Is the Life,"
he took out the "BUT" and inserted
a semicolon, going right on with the
tune. He said the song sounded bet
ter that way. :
Anyhow Slim has been baseballing
for many years now and he always
hies himself back to Brown-co, O., at
the close of a season. A ' year ago
he bought a hundred acres at Fees
burg. He raises chickens, tobacco,
nice, fat porkers, corn, oats, potatoes
and has a few good milk cows.
In the summer Slim lives at Fees
burg, when the club is playing in
Cincinnati, making the trip back and
forth. When he is away his brother-in-law,
who lives "down the road,"
looks after things, ana of course, Mrs.
Sallee stays on.
Both Bailee and the "missus" were,
born in the neighborhood and have
lived there all their lives. Some
times Slim gives his address as Hig
ginsport which has 200 more inhabit
ants. And sometimes they refer to
him as the 'Higginsport sheriff."
Slim may be a "rube" but it ia from
choice and the batters who have
faced him in the National League
and in the late world's series will
say he's no hick when he's on the
mound.
There is plenty of ham and sau
sage in the Sallee smoke house, a
big stack of cakes every morning and
some money in the bank for Slim

crops were good, too.

Justice to Employees.
Eight-Hour Day.
This store will close at 5:30 p. m. every night from now until
Xmas except Wednesday, when we will remain open until
all customers are served.
In order to be fair to our employees we maintain the came
hours as mines and offices.
We believe the public will fully appreciate this and co
operate to the extent of shopping early in the day as possible.
The story is told of the little store-girl whose nightly prayer
at Christmas' time was this: "Thank God for the taking eff
of shoes." It is a pathetic cry, isn't it?
By shopping early in the day you save your own nerves
and that of clerks who are so rushed and tired; try and the)'
will give you the service you would like.
