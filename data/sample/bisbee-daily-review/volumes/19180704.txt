A. T. Thomson, assistant to the
president of the Phelps Dadge corpor-
ation, came down to visit us from j
Douglas yesterday, and while here I
gave out the good news that the re- j
cent advanre cf 2'2 cents in the price j
nf Conner surely would result in an
increase in the wages of the miners
of the Warren district.
In an interveiw with a Review re
porter, Mr. Thomson said:
"Now that the government has taken
this action, ac'vocated both by the
working men and the copper pro
ducers, there is no question but that a
substantial -increase in wages soon
will follow."
Asked if. in his opinion, the wage
increase would become effective at
once, Vie said:
"It is my opinion that the wage in
crease will be made effective begin
ning July 1 and I have no doubt that
an announcement as to the amount
of the increase will be published as
coon as the details can be worked out."
Whin, asked if the other coppar
companies of the" state would take the
same action as the Phelps Dodge cor
poration in this matter, Mr. Thomson;
said he had not had an opportunity io
confer with the managers of the other
companies but had- no doubt, under
the circumstances, that all the copper
producers would be willing to increase
the wage scale.

WITH THE AMERICAN ARMY
IN FRANCE, July 3, (By the As
sociated Press) The enemy artil
lery this afternoon increased the
intensity of its fire in the Vaux re
gion. The crash of exploding shells
swelled to a roar, while the ground
and air throbbed with the concus
sions of shells. But the Amer
ican guns answered the German
challenge, shot for shot.
The American gunners, stripped
to the waist, stood in the gun pits
and on gun emplacements, feeding
sheila as fast as they could handle
them into the guns, and a steady
stream of steel explosives swept
through space on to the enemy
lines.
At S o'clock this evening the
gun fire showed no signs of abat
ing, the enemy artillery work, if
anything, evidencing mote ferocity
thaa ever. The American aviators,
keeping vigil over the fighting
zone, found the ground completely
obscured at places by the smoke
of the engines and sheds.
Among the captured material
thus far counted are six heavy
machine guns, eighteen light ma
chine guns, six trench mortars,
two grenade throwers, 200 rifles,
one motorcycle machine gun and
large quantities of ammunition
and equipment.

next week to recess immediately af

President Wilson asked for its adop

In reaching an agreement on the

AMERICANS AT

HOLDING GROUND
(Continued from Page One)
De Liague forest the French have
struck the German line over a front of
nearly two miles and have penetrated
to a depth of approximately a hall
mile. Prisoners to the number of 457
have been reported captured.
The British were unable to retain
the positions they seized on Sunday
near Bouzincourt, north of Albert.
After a terrific bombardment the Ger
mans succeeded In recapturing the
ground. On the north side of the
Picardy sector at Boyelles and Moyen
neville, and in the Lys sector, at Mer
ris, the British have taken prisoners
in raiding operations.
The Italians have again shifted their
attack and this time have chosen the
Piave front for a demonstration of
their strength. After a bombardment
which reached drum fire intensity the
Italians crossed the Piave northeast of
Capo Sile. In spite of the flooded areas
before them, they made some progress,
which is admitted by Vienna, and cap
tured 1000 prisoners as well as taking
valuable war material. Austrian coun
ter attacks in the Grappa region, east
of the Brenta, have been repulsed.
American air lighters have taken part
in combats during the fighting at
Vaux and are credited unofficially
with destroying seven German ma
chines. In the fighting on Tuesday,
the British destroyed thirteen enemy
airplanes and forced nine more to de
scend out of control.
The Ukraine government, which was
set up by the German military authori
ties is tottering to its fall, it is report

WITH THE AMERICAN ARMY
IN FRANCE. July 3 (By The
Associated Press). A heavy Ger
man counter attack against the
American ""positions at Vaux,
launched at 1 o'clock this morning
was repulsed, the enemy losing
very heavily. Not a foot of the
ground won by the Americans in
their attack on Monday night was
lost
The counter attack developed after
the Germans had heavily bombarded
Vaux and Boise De La Roche. When
the German infantry leaped from the
trenches the troops came over in close
formation.- In some cases whole com
panies were allowed to approach close
to the American lines; then the Amer
ican machine gunners, from their hid
den nests, let loose a perfect hail ot
bullets, mowing down the enemy ranks
and piling the dead all over the ground
where the Germans were trying to ad
vance. The American artillery lent efficient
aid in completely breaking up the
enemy attack, which was launched
with fresh regiments of storm troops.
The number of prisoners taken by the
Americans In the operations near Cha
teau Thierry was increased today
without the American infantry oper
ating except as skirmishers.
German shells have been raining on
the new American positions and the
enemy fire has been answered by the
American guns. The American line
was the target of projectiles of all
callibres, gas shells being mixed with
high explosives missiles. The shells
have been falling heavily in the areas
behind the battle line The enemy
fire, particularly on the right flank of
the new positions at Vaux, was most
intense for hours.
At last reports the American ma
chine gunners were holding - their
ground and repulsing small but desper
ate efforts of the Germans to regain
the ground wrested from them. The
Americans are reported to be well pro
tected by their temporary trenches
and are not exposing themselves need
lessly to the storm of flying steel from
the bursting German shells.
The German loss in killed is un
known, but prisoners say that their
orders were to drive back the Amer
icans at all costs. They liave paid
the highest cost possible, but have
failed to perform the task entrusted
to them.
From the general conditions along
the battle line, it appears that further
attacks by the Germans are likely to
develop. The Americans, however,
are just as ready for what is .coming
as they were for what has passed, and
are just as confident as to the out
come. GERMANY MAKES CLAIMS
BERLIN, (via London) July 3. The

war office statement reads.
"Early yesterday morning on the
whole Piave front from Susegana

drum fire in several sectorss outh of
San Dona Di Piave. A few hours later
the enemys infantry advanced to the

the Piave.
"After bitter fighting, lasting the
entire day, the enemy was unable to
obtain any success with the excep
tion of a slight gain of territoy near
Chiesanuova.
"An attempt to land infantry on the
south wing, near Revedoli, which was
supported by enemy naval forces,
broke down. An Italian attempt to ef

Speaking of the morale of the army
In France the statement says:
"In France it was necessary to
change the name of the zone behind
the armies from the 'service of the
rear' to 'service of supply' because of
the difficulty in getting men to serve
in a region having the shell prool
designation 'rear.'
"Even at the actual front there is
something of a tradition in the use of
the term 'no man's land.' Our men
prefer to call it and to make it "Yan
kee Land.'
"Mr. Iiaker said the commisison of
classification of personnel reports that
"a surprisingly large proportion of re- j
cruits ask to be placed in the most j
hazardous branches of the military ;
service," and added: j
"If a reply is needed to those who
say that the men of the national army
are in camp because they have to be,
it is this: That those men are going
over the top because they want to
go."
"Consensus of opinion is," continued
the statement, "that drunkenness in
the army is completely under control,
both in the United States and France.
You may travel for weeks in France
without seeing an intoxicated Amer
ican soldier.
"There is no permanent military !
t amp in the United States with a 're I ;
iight district' in its vicinity."

rate tier thousand among all troops In j
the United States for the week ending j
June 7 was 4.14 as against a rate u:
20.14 in the regular army in the United
States in lSltS and 5.13 in 1916.
On June 5 the capacity of the hos

enemy. It is lortineu iy uie i uueu

Secretary Daniels said:
"The American people have had a
fresh baptism of the spirit of sacri
fice for liberty which enabled the men
of '7G to make the declaration of Inde
pendence the decree of a powerful na-
Itlon. They have entered this war to
aid in Insuring a peaceful people free
dom from conquest, and they will not
Jay down the sword until the menace
of militarism is lilted from mankind.
Out of the tragedy of the war the
steady light of peace, guaranteed by
a league of all free nations, will illum
ine the world."
This., will . he . Secretary.. Lansing's
message:
"This year the Fourth of July is

Fourth of July
The record of American trcop move
ments to France during 1918 makes the
finest reading for Fourth of July since .the
declaration of Independence was written.
Let us see. In January, 1918, we sent
46,000 men across the Atlantic to help
England and France beat the Hun. In Feb
ruary, 48,000; in March, 83,000; in April,
1 17,000; in May, 244,000; in June, 276,
000; about 800,000 in all.
In August 1731, just 137 years ago, the
greatest American troop movement of all
that period of eight years of war that
marked our birth as a nation was made
when Washington marched with 9000
American and 7000 French soldiers to in
vest Ycrktown, where Cornwallis was es
tablished with 8000 British troops. Mark
the numbers; rr.ark the alignment on that
epochal August day, 137 years ago. The
main American army, under the command
er in chief, himself, reinforced by our ally,
totaled only 1 6,000 men. The largest Eng
lish army in this country at that time was
the force in Yorktown under Cornwallis, as
it totaled 8000 men. We were fighting Eng
land; France was our ally.
And during six months of this year we
sent 800,000 soldiers across the Atlantic
ocean to fight with France and England in
a world war. A little over 1 00 years ago
we could muster but 9,000 men in our larg
est army for our greatest undertaking of
our war for independence". Our illy sent
7,000 men to help us." Our enemy, Eng
land, sent only about 40,000 men to Amer
ica during the entire war of the revolution,
covering a period of eight years.
The greatest battle of the revolutionary
war was that fought at Brandywine when
General Howe, leading 18,000 British
troops, defeated Washington, who had
about 1 1 ,000 colonials in his army. The
Americans lost 1 ,000 men here and the city
of Philadelphia, and the British lost about
600 men. Lafayette was wounded in
this battle.
And in the month of June alone we sent
276,000 American soldiers to France to aid
the British and to pay in rivers of blood
for every drop of blood lost by the brave
Lafayette in this battle.
There was never a time in our history
when it was so appropriate to talk of revo
lutionary battles as now. Never a time
when comparisons were so glorious. The
baby republic of that day is the giant that
is now striding to save those old nations
that were great before we were born. Ah,
could the men who fought and builded then
have known of today! Could they have
been given to see the troopships on the At
lantic tide carrying a million of their sons
to France to fight for Liberty! That tide,
upon which floated those few old wooden
sailing ships of DeGrasse before Yorktown
the day this nation was really born.
And 1 37 years hence, when our children
celebrate the Fourth of July! Will they,
then, be able to make such glorious com
parisons, juggling with the figures of their
nation's progress, like a conjurer throwing
shining balls in the sunlight of glory, as
we make this day? Will the work we are
doing now, the sacrifices and the fighting
and the achievements, loom as large to
them in the shaping of history, as Wash
ington's victory at Yorktown looms to us
this day? x
Will the million men we sent to Europe
in a tvclvc iviorilh, vng i!ie prr al Al'nn'.ic
as though it were a canal and our keels a
bridge, :crn as small to them as Washing
ton's army it Yorklcwn seems to us now?'
Will there bo. anoiher Yorktown, this one in
Germany, where American and French
troops storm to victory? And will that vio
tory be as lasting in its effects as the one
at Yorktown, Virginia?
We have psid the debt of Lafayette with
interest corr.pounoed throughout the years,
and our English foes of yesterday are
brothers now. Will France and England be
helping us 100 years from now in some
great struggle for the right?
Our little old Fourth of July, declared by
a few hundred men in a little village called
Philadelphia, and fought for by a few
thousand men in ragged uniforms during
eight years while a weak, raw, half-starved
people clung to sections of desolate coctsl
line and patches of mountain and wilder
ness, is to be observed this year with pomp
and ctrlerdor and whirlwind enthusiasm
by 200,000,000 of people from San Fran
cisco, to New York, to Paris, to London, to
1 Rome.
How the world moves in its glorious ad
vance along the shining path of liberty and
the equality of men! And how little do
the builders and fighters know of the
strength and permanency of their building
and the far flung and lasting effects of their
battles. In Germany and Austria alone, cf
all the nations of Christendom, does the
American Fourth of July fall this year like
a blight and a pall. Alas for these peoples,
still living in the medieval days when there
were only two classes upon the earth, beasts
of burden and beasts of prey. They are
slaves still, king ridden and tax ridden and
war ridden and having no voice in the direc
tion of their own affairs. The magna
charter of England and the column of July
of France and the Fourth of July of Amer
ica, shining symbols in the heavens of
liberty, mean nothing at all to them. They
haVe the kaiser with his big moustache and
the crov. n prince with his little one and the
iron cross and the iron chain and the mil
itary yoke and the same old yesterdays and
never a light ahead to mark a new tomor
row. They celebrate only the birthdays of
their rulers, and never a birthday of their
own.
Ah, how fine it is to havrj a Fourth of
July. And how fine it is to know that
every year adds to the lustre and the fame
end the world importance of that day!
A record breaking American cotton crop
of over 1 5,000,000 bales is predicted for
this year. Now a bale weighs about 500
pounds. Cotton thread is selling for $3 a
spool in Vienna. They are wearing paper
clothes in Germany. But American cotton
goes direct to France and England by the
ship load, along with copper and steel and
provisions, in order to strengthen the .in
dustrial lines, that are so necesseiy to keep
the battle lines tuned to the highest pitch
of efficiency. A million bales of American
cotton would be worth as much to Ger
many today as an army. And, speaking of
cotton, this column will never believe that
Germany has found a perfect and adequate
substitute for cotton in the manufacture of
high explosive shells. When the collapse
does come in Germany it will be found that
cotton and copper played no small part in
bringing it about.
A proud record, truly, is that of the
workers of the United States, made public
yesterday by Chairman Dent of the mili
tary affairs committee. Without the cheer
ful, whole-hearted cooperation of the work
ers, our men at the front would be defense
less, just as we should be powerless, should
our soldiers "go on strike." The lesson is
a beneficial one for of a truth "united we
stand; divided we fall." The man who
mines the copper is defending his country
just as though he were on the front line,
drawing a bead on a German with h;s
rifle.
Well, the Austrians were checked on the
Piave but the house of Hapsburg still
stands. Strikes in Vienna and elsewhere in
the dual, monarchy have been put down and
the war goes on just the same with Austria
supporting Germany with all her strength
Be sure of this: The war will go on and on
until Germany suffers a serious reverse
upon the field of battle.
Senator Mark Smith always speaks, right
out, in meeting or out of meeting, any
time, anywhere and on any subject that has
vital interest with the general public. ! lis
letter to Mrs. O'Neil, published in The
Review yesterday morning, congratulating
her - upon her special resolution directed
against the I. W. W., was characteristic of
this grand old man of Arizona affairs.
Hunt vetoed the "Vag" bill. Well, a
politician has fo protect his friends and fol
lowers, else he soon would not have any.
Eh, what!
And now comes the street railway cor
poration of Tucson before the city council
and asks for permission to raise ihn fare
for riding on its cars from 5 to 7 cents.

Still each passing year witnessed the

And a.; the fire of Democracy burneJ

In the New World, kindred fire.-, were

And the bowed form of Humanity be

For her Children were coming into

Yet even as the strength of the peop:e

Arose from the womb of militari.- m.

Were shaped but for one end, and one

To strengthen the arm that wleldei

And when she felt that arm sufficient

At the heart of Democracy in the Old

Struck, as the cobra in the Indian
jungle strikes, without want or

Then maddened with lust for power.
And blinded, by the darkness that she
herself had made
She turned and hurled the gage of
battle
At the feet of Democracy in the New

Behold a United Democracy fighting
the Battle of Freedom.
Side by side with the TrI Color and

Fighting that the ideals w hich gave us

The Choice of
Those Who Know
Manufacturers and leading mo
tor car distributors recommend
ZEROLENE. The majority
of motorists use ZEROLENE.
ZEROLENE reduces wear and
gives more power because it
keeps its lubricating body at
cylinder heat. Gives less car
bon because, being refined
from selected California asphalt-base
crude, it burns clean
and gees out with exhaust.

fhe trtlck that will transport
f merica's array supplies is at work.
Xficially, it is known as Class "I"
Hilitary Truck, but its pet name
imongthe army men who like it, is
Truck B."
It is for use in the Quartermast
er's department only, but since this
Apartment has charge of the trans
lortation for the army, it means
J-qt "Truck B" delivers the jroods to
mr fighting forces. It is the heavi
st of the quartermaster trucks. It
las a fcur-cylinder engine and is
jipable of carrying from three to
ive tons.
Instead of waiting for railroad
Tansportation, the Quartermaster
General is detailing officers and men
jo drive the trucks overland. There
ire two reasons for this. One is.
hat it saves badly needed cargo
pace oo- the railroads; the other is
hat the army officers are not only
mrVing a test of the- trucks but a
test of the men who drive them.
Trucks Travel in Fleets.
The trucks travel in fleets, now
wending their way over different
arteries of trafne. The first test run
was from Lima, Ohio to Baltimore.
Maryland, under the supervision of
tnen'from Camps Meade and Devens,
who brought twenty trucks across
the country without a hitch. Not
one man in" the detachment had even
been one of the trucks until called on
to drive it. The officer observers
who accompanied the men gave no
tistructions. Their idea was to see
iow a detachment cf soldiers would
handle the trucks when delivered in
France. Another fleet is now on its
way from Chicago to Camp Dodge,
Iowa. This fleet is made up of six
teen trucks.
c Truck B's Tremendous Power.
The tremendous power of the new
trucks, armv officers say, was shown
bv the fact that no hill was reached
Which thev could not climb on
"high." Only onco, they say, was
low gear resorted to and that was
at a notorious mudhole near East
Palestine. Ohio. There, the first
few trucks went through on low
.rear. When it was found that they
got through easily on "low", the
others followed on "second." In
-ossing mountains, high gear was
:sed weeept in rounding turns where
i trucks slowed down for safety.
The entire trip of approximately
- 'n miles was made in a total run
ping time of 77 hours and a fract:on.
The average mileage was 0V2 miles
ft gallon. The trucks traveled at a
rate of f.O miles a day. the running
time being about seven miles an
hour.
. Made By 14S Motor Companies.
' ' "Truck B" is to be the standard
'.leavy truck of the army. It is so
thoroughly standardized that, al
though it is being made by 146 dif
ferent motor manufacturing firms,
every part of every truck, even to
the nuts and bolts, is identical. It
was designed by a committee of
antonioLile engineers from many

companies who gave their services to
the Government free. The engine
is a remarkable piece of work, it is
said, thoroughly simple and yet pro
ducing tremendous power. Automo
bile engineers pronounce it one of
the greatest products of the war.
The motors division of the
Quartermaster General's Corps of
ttie army has changed the system of
shipment of trucks so as to cut oft
three-fourths of the space required
on board ship. A truck, standing,
usually occupies 1,000 cubic feet of
space. Truck B is being taken down
at the ports of embarkation end
packed so it occupies only 2C-3 cubic
feet.
S s-... V
M USE
The new truck, now being turned
out by the thousand in many differ
ent motor truck plants, is to become
one of the principal means of trans
porting supplies from the seaports
of France to American troops ut the
front. Not onlv is the truck doing,
all that is expected of it but it is l e
iflg produced rapidly in quantities
and set down at poi-ts of embarka
tion all ready for shipment.
On March 30, the truck3 were be
ing turned out at the rate of thirty
a day. On April S, they were being
turned out at the rate of forty a
day. So steadi'y is the productive
capacity growing that by Jur', it is
said, they will come forth from the
factories at the rata of 100 a day
and after that in whatever numbers
the V.ir Department desires.

SABOTAGE BILL WILL
BECOME LAW IN
NINETYDAYS
Governor Hunt Refuses to
Sign Name and Gives His
Reasons; Does Not Carry
Emergency Clause
The salMtage bill, recognized as th
; most important war legislation passed
. by the fust special session of tne leg -
! islature, became a law at midnight
; Monday night without" executive ac-
I tion. The bill does not carry the
emergency clause and will not. thrie -
lore, oecorne rftcctive untii the expiru-
tion of ninety days. Governor Hunt
; exercised his power or. veto cm Loin

I cotton and giuin bibs.
'in a message adurefcscd to Secrctaiy
'of Stale Sidney p. Oshorn, Governor
.Hunt explained why he had not taken
action on the sabotage act. His mes
! sage is as follows:
! ' Although this law is exceedingly
; poorly drawn and vague in its terms I
i am unwilling to disapprove it. as Us ,
; fundamental principle is sound and a-ij
; old as law itself. It is, however, untor- j
j tunatc that such hasty and loosely pre-:
j pared legislation, such as this act and i
j others, passed in the first special ses
I sion of the third Arizona state legisla-j
I ture, should become a part of our iuw !
j sssss ssssss ssss etaoilaoiunalaoini-si '
Legislative boards and universities
throughout the country are alert to all
current lawmaking and such a biiVas
mis not oniy renecis upon tne legis-;
lative body that framed it but the leg-
isture favorably upon the entire stte.

and it is to 1 e gravely uiau.e lor tilu 0mi!iauou for ine ot

ed to allow this ull lo become a law l
The grain and v'Oi V.u l y prodm ts j
bill was vetoed, the governor explain-1
ed, because it did not conu under the
heading of special war legislation and
could not therefore, bj constitutional,
inasmuch as the attorney general nad
ruled that only matters included in tho
special call cenld be ibemsea.
The power of veto wi: exercised In
the antl-avgrancy act b2ruse. the gov
ernor stated, it was not Jra.vn to meft
conditions in tills o'.-.te and therefore
would work an injustice. It is modeled .
after similar Dlts oi legislation passto i
In eastern states, he ci.;ciu!e.s, where .
conditions are entirely different than
those existing her. He also raised the
question of the constitutionality ot
such an act and in a message to the
secretary of state explained hi3 posi-
tinn & fnllnws
Admitting that to reach the highest
state of efficiency in our present
struggle for the preservation ot our
national ideals it might become neces
sary to add to our conscription of men
for our fighting forces conscription of
labor and conscription of wealth !t
would appear that wnen sucn action didute for tho nomination for me oi

"However, I should have been gled
to have seen our state take the initia
tive in this matter and if the legisla
ture had passed a bill with due regard
to conditions in Arizona such a bill
would have been approved. House bill
No. 2. however, is modeled after some
of the bills considered in eastern
btates, where conditions are entirely
different, and no state has as yet test
ed the effectiveness or constitutional
ity of such a law. While 1 would not
venture to state that this bill is In vio
lation of the thirteenth amendment to
the constitution, still it must be appar
ent that any law making work com
pulsory without in any way designat
ing the terms or conditions of the
work comes very close to the danger
line of peonage."

clears the ditches there will be for
the first time in its history some badly
washed surfaces in spots on the road
to Bisbee. The proceedure in the post
has been to have the ditches cleaned
just before the "rains begin and this
method has worked well, keeping
down the expenses of vtokeep and sav

attention to the need at thi3 time.

TOO MUCH TERRITORY.
A big strapping young man from,
Texas about twenty-three or four
years old, was up at the boys'
department of the Y. M. C. A. the otn
er night and began to brag about his
fighting qualities. He stated that jf
he could not whip any three Arizona
boys that he ever saw he would go
back to Texas. There was a couple
of Arizona youngsters about 15 yeani
old in the room at the time and they
did not much like the tone of his re
marks bo something was started and
the Texan was soon seen going at a
lively gait toward Texas but stopped
at the city hall long enough to report
to the officers that he had been mob
bed. The officers made an investiga
tion and found that the boys had up
held the dignity of the state of Ari
zona and that the Texan had taken in
too much territory as the old fighting
story goes. He shows 'signs of his en
counter while the boys were without a
scratch.

LOST HER GRIPS.
It is reported that a Bisbee woman
who made a trip to Rodeo on Tuesday

that she forgot to claim them when
the officers carried them off the train.
