WASHINGTON, March 29 In
crease of 20 per cent in domestic tele
graph rates effective April 1 was an
nounced today by Postmaster General
Burleson.
' The Increase was agreed upon at a
meeting of the federal wire board and
was made necessary, Mr. Burleson's
announcement said, to meet the "In

by wage increases now in effect, made
during the past year."
Mr. Burleson added that the advance
would be "barely sufficient" for this
purpose.
Mr. Burlesons order follows:

, Mr. Burleson's order was issued by
the department without comment, oth

future League of Nations in Holland.
Another group opposes Brussels.

BOLSHEVISM SOCIAL
DISEASE, DECLARES
CHICAGO MAYORALITY
CAMPAIGN : ENDS AS
SLAVS' AMBASSADOR' 3 CLAIM ELECTION
Russian Envoy Says Lenine
and Trotzky Backing
German Spartacans
PARIS, March 29. (By the Asso
ciated Press.) '"Bolshevism is not a
political movement; it is a social dis
ease, and must be treated as such."
said Horis Bakhmeteff. Russian am
bassador to the United States today,
in discussing the efforts to check bol
shevism. "All middle E'.irope is like a man
wit ha fever," he continued. Before
the disease can be treated the tem
perature must be reduced, and the
only way to do that is by supplying
food, clothing, medieines and other
things to make life normal. And., in
my opinion, German bolshevism should
should be fought before that in other
countries by such treatment.
"The world is threatened with , a
lapse into barbarism comparable with
that in the fourth century when Greek
and Tloman civilizations were sub
merged. In Russia today practically
the entire population is ma.d. Bolshe
ciki and noa-bolsheviki alike are un
balance' dby ' the struggle and hard
ships, and are incapable of sound
judgment. Hunger and suffering have
rendered the Russians forgetful of the
old standards and they are indifferent
to fate. The hopelessness can be
overcome only by food and manufac
tured '.articles yiecessafy for bodily
comfort."
Russian Outlook Favorable.
Commenting on the military situa
' tion in Russia, M. Hakmeteff said a
summary of the Russian committee's
dispatches from Archangel, Omsk,
Kuban, the Don- and Ukraine showed
conditions favorable everywhere ex
cept in the southwest, wheer the Don
Cossacks were much affected by the
announcement of the proposed Prin
kipo conference, and virtually gave up
the struggle for a short time, saying
that it was impossible to fight the
bolslieviki if the allies gave such rec
ognition. However, the Ik)n Cossacks had
been reorganized under General Bo
gaewsky, who had succeeded General'
Krasncff, and was at the present time
co-operating with Ceneral Denikine.
M. Bakhmeteff expressed the belief
that the entire Ukraine would fall
under bolshevik! control, eycepting
Odessa. He said this was inevitable,
as Ukraine had' not settled her asrra
ria ntroubles, and M. Petiura, the Uk
raine peasant leader, is far from being
wel lorganized. ;
Back Sparta can Movement; Tf
On the Perm and Ufa fronts, in M.
Bakmeteff's opinion, the Kolchak
forces are in excellent condition and
will doubtless advance 'rapidly into
bo!sheiki territory when the extreme
ly cold weathe rabates and the spring
floods subside late in Hay.. The Kol
cha kis able to collect taxes and saiJ
the ambassador, many other evidences
of confidences in Kolchak's democracy
are being displaye damong all classes.
The Russian commission, according
to M. Bakhmeteff ,has. learned that
practically all the money for the Spar
tacan movement in Germany was sup
plied by the Russian bolsheviki lead
ers, Lenine and Trotzky, who shipped
the government platinum, gold and
.silver reserve to Stockholm, where it
was exchanged for German marks.
Reports from General Denekine at
. Ekaterinodar indicate that his troops
have been suffering terribly from lack
of anaesthetics and medical supplies
of all sorts. Amputations have been
made without anaesthics, the soldiers
underoging great hardships in the
hospitals. The Russian commission
has been negotiating with the Ameri
can Red Cross, which has promised to
relieve the situation.

CHICAGO, March 29. Chicago's j
municipal campaign ofr mayor closed;
tonight with a carnival of noise andj
downtown spectacles which many, ob
servers declared had not been equaled :
in years. Besides circus rings, .there :
were stages to accommodate the hum-

the six candidates for mayor at the!
election on Tuesday, April 1, . :-
Bands blared through the downtown
streets all day; automobiles loaded'
with political workers, their vehicles'
bef lagged and pennant-decorated, j
showered handbills; women filled!
auto . trucks and wtch megaphones
proclaimed the names o ftheir favo-;

diers and sailors in small companies
marched; thei business heart of .the
city was bedlam, as the burlesque;
raged, with street corner oratory
flowing . fiom balcoiues, boxes- and
automobiles. Numerous fistic encoun
ters occurred, without serious results
so far as reported.
Mayor William Hale Thompson, re
publican; County Clerk Robert M
Sweitzer, democrat, and State's At

ning as- an independent candidate , by
petition, each claimed victory tonight
in the contest for mayor by large

Other mayoralty candidates are:
John Fitzpatrick, labor party; John

socialist labor. Besides the mayor,
thirty-five aldermen and other mu-l
nicipal ofifces are to be voted on.
Mayor Thompson, elected four years
ago over Sweitzer by 14S.000, has been
assailed by his opponents on his war j
lecord, and also as a servant of pub
lic utilities, which he denied; the
public utility favoritism has been the
principal charge also against Sweit
zer, and both he and Thompson have
beeu charged by Hoyne with being

PARIS, March 29. (By the Asso-i
cated Press.) The military situation j
at Danzig, whera negotiations are un-!
der way for the passage through Ger-i
Lmany of three Polish legions intended
tor service with the Polish army, is
explained by military experts attached
to the peace commission i na different '
manner from the explanation givtn iu i
dispatches from Berlin. !
It is sai dthe German purpose ap-'
pears to be to direct the movement j
o fthese troops so as to avoid unnecs-j
sary chance of friction o rhootile col-1
lisions with the German populace in!
the region to be traversed. There-!
fore, while Danzig was named ia the!
armistice as the port of debarkation ;
best adapted for the purpose, jt is re-
garded by the military authorities as!
only proper that the entente torn-
manders should consider any proposi-l
tion by the German authorities look- i
ing to the use of other German ports '
as a violation of the armistice.
One source of delay has been found
in the failure to secure quickly the ;
shipping necessary to convey the
Polish legions to th Unnan port of
Jbarkation. It will rquir thirty ships
of 5, "00 tons anch and two mouths'
time to complete the movement, and
negotiations have not been completed

FLIGHT UNOFFICIAL,
IS DEFENSE OFFERED
BY CPT. CHAMBERLAIN
Court Martial Attorneys At
tempt to Prove Texas
Boy Told Truth
fRv Review Leasfcd Wire)
LXTNDON, larch 29. In the court
martial proceedings oday of Captain
Edmund G. Chamberlain ef San An
tonio, Texas, in connection with his
claims of noted aerial performances in
company with British air forces last
summer, the defense's cross-examination
of the famous British, airman.
Major R. 3. Maxwell, commanding
squadron 54 at Touquen at the time of
Chamberlain's Tisit, indicated that an
attempt would be made to show that
Chamberlain had made an unofficial
flight with the con'idvaaee of some
British pilot friend, disguising him
self in the latter'a flying clothes.
Major . .Maxwell, who testified yes
terday that Chamberlain flew no ma
chine of his squadron and that he did
not know any of the British officers
named In the reports of Chamberlain's
exploits, admitted today that it was
possible for a visitor to get away in
a machine for flight, but said he had
such confidence in his pilots that he
was certain he would be advised of
any such incident, and, furthermore,
would be able to check up any falsi
ficatlon X na pilot's report.
The defense brought out that the
witness had said to Captain Chamber
lain at Lille, where he had met him
at the offices in January last:
"Aren't you the fellow that stole a
Camel (the name of machine) from us
at Touquin?" and also that he had
told Lieutenant Commander P. 3. Al
ia rl, XL S. N., who had investigated
in in&moenaux case, that no squad
ron commander wouia admit having
let a sailor fly unofficially, as that
would mean the loss of his majority
and reduction to the ranks.
jlajor Maxwell could not remember
whether he had told Cqmmander Allan
that he would like to help Chamber
lain, but could not He Knew of cases
wheer pilots had claimed results that
could not be verified officially.
Major Maxwell promplty answered
the volley of questions which were
fired from both sides regarding the
minute details of his Couquin air
drome, his fighting machines and their
equipment, flight operations, -the to
pography of the front, the signalling
used in flights and tne work of the
squadron on the various days of
Chamberlain's reputed visit to Tou
quin. '
The court has been greatly impress
ed by the knowledge of thia work and
the exact information possessed by
the royal forces witnesses and at the
conclusion of Major Maxwell's testi
mony, the prosecution gravely asked
the witness if he had ever taken a
course in memory training. He
wished to show in the record to the
reyiewing authorities, he said, "what
a remarkable witness the court had
before it." ' .
: Castain OMl. . Heakwill and V. S.
Bennfett of the royal air forces, testi
fied that certain parts of the report
of Chamberlain's flight were highly
improbable.,.. .

It's a long suffering people the Unit

under 1L0 direction of the League of

It's a people who claim an early
civilization, whose homeland is the
very heart of the region which the
Bible tells us was re-peopled by the
sons of Noah after the great deluge.
Alt. Ararat, where Noah's ark went
aground, is in the center of their
land.
A thousand years before Christ a
distinct Armenian people occupied
this region and paid tribute to a line
of noble kings and boasted of culture
and learning.
Their Vingdom extended from the
Black sea and the Caucasus mountains
to Persia and Syria and had an area
cf 500,000 square miles.

The Armenian church was estab-!

years before hte Greek church-and
became a strong power behind Chris-

When the Ottoman Turk set up his
mosque at Agia Sofia in the sixteenth
century he got a grip on the land
that has not been .loosened until the
great war killed the poorer or the

MOHAMMED TOLERANT.
Mohammed, the conqueror, was tol
erant for a time. He left the Chris
tians alone, though granting them no
civu recognition until tee emfcced
Mohammedanism. Armenians became
the traders and business men among
the Turks and were loyal as citizens,
though they clung to their ancient
language and religion.
Armenia, in ume, on tne ever-
changing map of Europe, was divided ,
among Turkey, Russia and Persia. But
Turkey controlled most. Russian Ni
hilists provoked revolts in 1S85 and
warfare marked by extreme cruelty on
both sides was waged.
Turkey Intrusted the subduing of
the rebels to the savage Kurds and
then began the massacres which have
stirred the civilized world and made
the name of Turkey infamous.
In 1894 England. France and Rus
sia, backed up by their warships made
the sultan promise restitution and
reforms. The Armenians wanted
safety, a share in the government and
proportional representation.
KURDS COMMIT ATROCITIES.
But the Turks and tne Kurds were
illy curbed and the massacres contin-
ued. Villages were devastated, fam-
ine and plague followed. TIie Turk-
iEh government relunctantly permitted
the Red Cross to bring relief to the
sufterers. The outrages became fewer
for a time But in August, 1916, a '
mob in Constantinople, spurred on'byj
eovernment agents, beat to death
4,000 Armenians, because of attacks!
by a group of Armenians on the Otto-
man bank. j
Determined efforts to stamp out the'
entire Armenian race followed this
outbreak, and European alliances .be
came so entangled that no power
dared to ttep in and compel the in
humanity to cease.
Fanaticism and cupidity of the igno
rar.t tutijcct of the Turkish ogvern
mont were played on and they came
to see the -xiermination of the Ar
menian as a nvigious duty, vith con
fiscation of Lis property as the re
ward. THOUSANDS DIE.
Wi'.h the outbreak of the great war
and the entrance of Turkey on the
side cf Germany, the extermination of
the Armenians was quickened. They
were slai-gbtcred hy thousands in
their homes and villages. They were
herded togetht-r for deportation and
started on marches of hundreds of
miles which had for their purpose only
lac death by exhaustion and starva
tion of the n-diehcrs. Hundreds whose
vitAHty carried tl-.crn far were butch
ered by the roadsides. Mothers with
babes who fell out were either slain

Then
Only a few years ago women wore bustles; no one ever heard of
"tin Lizzies;" eggs were 10 cents a dozen; Hired girls drew $1 a week;
nobody listened in on the telephone; no one heard of prohibition; on one
cared for the price of gasoline; operations were rare; nobody swatted
the fly; cream was five cents a pint; butchers "threw In a chunk of
liver," aad the Y. M. C. A. and Y. W. C. A. were regarod as narrow,
sectarion, visionless institutions.
Now we set the clock ahead an hour to utilize time and to make
the most of the day's hours. We read of trans-sea trips by airplane.
Little motor cars within the reach of every man are about to start compe-
tition with street cars. People not only swat the fly, but weed out
other evils which pester society. Bustles are replaced by narrow skirts.
And the Y. M. C. A. and Y. W. C. A. are taking their places in a world
which is advancing with marvelous strides.
Vision has entered the brain of the two associations. As time has
passed, as automobiles have replaced horse-drawn vehicles, as distance
has been shattered by the telephone, telegraph and steam car, the
Y. M. C. A. and Y. W. C. A. have forsaken their narrow creeds of only
a few years ago, to take their places in advancing civilization. The re
sult has been rejuvinated, re-inspired organization irf each instance. Both
associations have fallen into the stride of the rest of the world.
Only a few years ago the Warren district Y. M." C. A. had a handfull
of members and inadequate quarters. Bible classes, a reading room and
little else characterized its activities. The district's Y. W. C. A. had
not even been organized. Some had dared dream of it; but this small
part of the world wasn't prepared at that day for such an association.
Today both have large memberships. The buildings which they oc
cupy represents huge sum3 of money and wealth. Their equipment is
complete. They offer not t,he attractions of the past, but broader, newer,
more universal and appealing attractions. Games, baths, moving picture
shows, physical culture and athletic contests are a part of their lives.
Courses under competent teachers which fit men and women for greater
work in . greater world, are an integral part of their mission.
They have opened their doors to the district and sent out their good
workers to the people. They have become a factor in community welfare
and life. They have gone out to men ana" 'women, forsaking the old tra
dition of trying to draw men and women in to them.
Why! the Y. M. C. A. even permits smoking and sells tobacco. Think
of the association of a few years ago encouraging Lady Nicotine.-
And the Y. M. C. A.! As a hostess house, didn't it encourage dancing?
Shocking! A few years ago no quicker path to "the bow wows" was
known than that woven by the waltz.
But then, a few years ago we laughed at the man who said he'd fly!
We looked on low grade copper ore as worse than no ore.
Our vision has changed. We recognize the work and value of tbe
Y. M. C. A. and Y. W. C. A. We realize they are assets without which
the community would be less healthy, less prosperous and less progres
sive. We comprehend the service they give, and we can see in the future
their greater field of endeavor.
Knowing, shouldn't we give? They are asking & lifting hand to
ward a higher service: Tomorrow they close their appeal. And tomor
row your opportunity to give them the assistance they need will pass.
Will your name be among the farsighted who look to a future as 1
great as our "now" when our "now" will look to us and our childre'n
as our "then" looks today? As you give so shall you measure the
progress of the years and without you giving a helping hand today little
can you claim or tne greater world
Living Up to Reputation
As usual Maricopa county . and Phoenix are retaining their place in
the re'ar ranks of state and nation. Not satisfied in lagging in good
roads construction they have now chosen to remain an hour behind the
rest of the nation in time, refusing to set their clocks to the daylight
saving schedule. .
Several advantages will accrue to Phoenix from the plan. Visitors
in the city will carry the national, time. Trains will leave according to
the national time. Hut busses operating to the trains will leave the hotels
when the hotel clock points to eight o'clock, and the trains due to leave
the city at eight o'clock, national time, will have been gone an hour.
Thereby Phoenix will profit financially by the longer stay of guests who
miss trains.
The residents of Phoenix will not lose even the hour. They have
never been known, to lose anything. In the legislature and In every
other deal they look to theic own interests first.
As a point of example, we have before us a beautiful illustration
of how Phoenix never loses anything except to profit thereby. The
chamber of commerce has just sent out from Phoenix' a pamphlet of
"Interesting Facts and Figures." On page 2 is a chart headed "W. S. S.
in Arizona." It contains these facts:
For the purpose of assessing War Stamp quotas the population of
Maricopa county is 44.731, while the population of Cochise for the same
purpose is 53,089. Consequently Maricopa county's quota is decidedly
less than Cochise county's burden. Then we turn to page 7 of the same
pamphlet and find that in 1914 Maricopa county had an estimated popu
lation of 53,348, and in 1919 a population of 70,254.
Of course the population of 70,254 is intended for commercial pur
poses to boost Phoenix and the figures of 44,731 are established solely
for assessments against Phoenix and the county.
Of course. Phoenix admitted the smaller population when the claim
to greater population would have meant a greater assessment! And there
by Phoenix officially retained lt3 plate in the rear ranks.
Returning to Phoenix' refusal to set the clocks ahead. Phoenix will
will lose nothing by not adopting the new time. The Rip Van Winkles of
the city will still be able tokeep track of the Rip Van Winkles of the
state house and the entire Salt River valley will enjoy one more hot
hour's sleep each summer morning.. And Phoenix will retain its place
in the rear ranks.
Can the Leopard Change His Spots? Mexico Has
Manuel Aguirre Berlunga, secretario de gubernacion of the Mexican
government, has officially announced that construction is now in pro
gress on about 700 miles of new lines of railway. All the work, Including
the production of materials, is being done by Mexicans.
This Is much better than raising hell down below the Rio Grande,
as once was the Mexicans' habit, isn't it?
"It is simply a question of time," asserts Senor Berlanga. "before
Mexico will take her place as a big producer. As soon as the world
is ready to trade, then the great nations will bring to' Mexico what we
need i raw materials and the finished products, and -Mexico will ex
port to yieni what they need in all those materials so richly abundant
here."
In other yoars Mexico used to be a great producer of trouble,
revolutions, riots and Villas. It is pleasing to note that now it is her
ambition to become producer of tilings worth trading for.
At times we are inclined to think that most of our near-statemcn
see nothing in. the league plan except a chance to cuss the other
party.
We may talk about new souls, but General Sir Frederick Maurice
explained the world's eagerness Tor a league when he said: "For tie
first tiuif; iu.lii.ory the British i-tople have been at war aud thiy
don't like it."

SWEEPING CHANGES
IN REORGANIZATION
OF ARMY ORDERED
"One Army" Plan to Be Car
ried Out in Forming Force
of 509,000
(By Review Leased Wire)
WASHINGTON, March 29. Orders
made public today by General March,
chief of staff, provide for the organ
ization of the regular army at a peace
strength of 509,000 officers and men
under plans that are a radical depar
ture from the pre-war establishment.
The effect Is to carry into the peace
time establishment the "one army"
organization which absorbed regulars,
national guard and national army dur
ing the war into the army of the Uni
ted States.
This is accomplished by perpetuat
ing in the permanent establishment
the numerical designations, names,
special insignia, war histories and
traditions and where possible, the
commissioned personnel of the di
visions, regiments and other units
which have particularly brilliant war
records. This project is furthered by
assigning to each of the cavalry di
visions to be organized, the number
and approximately the same home
area as one of the war divisions. The
new divisions, in each case, will be
recruited exclusively from that area
which is in adaption of the system
long employed in continental armies.
A feature of the plan is the assign
ment of the 42d division, which will
succeed the famous Rainbow division
of wartime, to become the cavalry di
vision of the new army. It will be
recruited from all part3 of the coun
try as will be the seven regular di
visions retained and which now are
part of the army of occupation. Each
of the seven regular divisions also la
assigned to a home camp as a perman
ent base and will be sent to that camp
when withdrawn from Europe.
' Pending further legislation, the
plans being followed call for the or
ganization of an army of five corps,
the first and second corps are coui
posed of the first to seventh divisions,
now overseas, and the others will be
formed at home when the new divisons
have been created. The peace strength
basi3 of an infantry division to whicu
these units will be recruited is 16,883
officers and men. The 42d, the cavalry
division, will have a peace strength of
15,978.
One project still under discussion
in connection with the localization of
the divisions is that of offering to of
ficers of the war-time divisions com
missions in the new regular . units.
This would enable the war department
to take into the regular service some
general officers of national guard
origin, it is understood, to command
substantially the same units they com
manded in France. In the case of the
New York division, to be located at
Camp Upton, it is regarded as prob
able that Maj. Gen. John F. O'Ryan.
who commanded the 27th division, will
be offered command of the new reg
ular division to carry that designation.

By "Biz" B. Phan
S'pose if I mention a certain
first sacker's name a lot o you ol'
timers whose memories extend
back to a certain world series
some moons ago will look up with
a grin an' recall a certain famous
incident. But it's got to be done,
so I might as well let you all in
on the fact right now that I'm
goin' to take Fred Merkle as the
topic for this mornin's chat. Not
afraid to take the chance, even if
you all did lose an hour when they

Merkle's famous boot has done
one thing for him, anyway. It's

that. His Btyle o' ball playin will
keep his name fresh for some
time, especially in the recollec
tions o' the big leaguers, who
don't- forget as fast as the fans
do.
To Merkle falls the duty of
guardin the ol' initial bag for the
Chicago Cubs, and he seems to ba
able to worry along in the position
all oked, as President Wilson
would say. To again plagarize on
the chief eexcutive, may I not call
attention to the remarkable fact
that in 129 games, figuring which
he handled no les sthan 14S5
chances, the first-sacker made
only 15 errors last season, gettin'
a fieldin' average o' .990.
Fred Merkle has been known to
gather himself a few hits now an"
then, too. Usually manages to
creep up in the .300 or better sec
tion o' the averages, but last sea
son didn't quite make it. finishin
the year with .297. 'Nother thing

changes in the motor laws of the state

House bill 148 reduces the cost of a
license for the man who buys a car
late in the year .the total fee being
graded downwards from a full fee in
the first quarter to one-fourth in the
last. Previous practice had been to
collect a full license fee fo rthe first
half of the year and 50 per cent for
any portion of the last half.
House bill 171 provided for full arm

Bisbee will be represented at the

the league suspended last season.
William Rourke, owne rof the Omaha

the St. Joseph, Mo., franchise, said
that Dickerson had given the club
owners no assurance of when he ex

two meetings had been adjourned
pending definite word from Dickerson
and then because of the lateness of
the esason it became necessary to
elect a president to administer the

WASHINGTON, March 29. Official

tomorrow morning, thus ushering in a
second summer of daylight saving.
The ne wtime will remain In force
until the last Sunday in October, when
clocks will be move dback an hour.
V'The change of time is made neces-
sary by the daylight saving law passed
by congress during the war and which
Js still In effect. Vigorous protests
against it were made during the last
congress by farmers' organizations
and the senate agricultural commit
tee added a "rider" to the agriculture
appropriation bill repealing the bill,
-but the supply measure was not acted
' upon.

until 2 o'clock. There will be no
change in railroad schedules and work

QUAINT PETITION TO
PRESIDENT REQUESTS
POLISH ANNEXATION
I Like America ; Think She
Help Us if She Knew,"
Says Ptasant
9
PARIS, March 29. (By the Asso
cated Press.) A quaint petition
reached. Paris today through the me
dium of a party of Polish peasants
from Orowa and Spisz districts In
northern Hungary .who objected to
the proposed plan of annexing them
to Czecho-Slovakla and are seeking an
audience with President Wilson In the
hope of having 120,000 isolated Pole3
incorporated into a new Poland.
The delegation, wearing suits of
thick white wool and felt gaily deco
rated with red embroidery andjhigh
Cossack caps of black shaggy fur, at
tracted much attention when they ar
rived, at Hotel de Crillon and sought
a naudience with the president. Two
members of the party, Pierre Borowy
and Adalbert Haboczsin, lived in the
United States years ago and remem
bered enough o fthe language to make
their desires known. Borowy, who
lived in Pittsburgh twenty-five years
ago, said:
"I read President Wilson's speeches
and told my friends that I was sure
he would not let us be annexed to
Czecho Slovaknia if we can tell him
how loyal our Polish colonies are to
Poland. We have the same religion
as Poland, our priest came with U3
to help save us from being swallowed
up by a people of different blood and
religion."
Hajjocrsin, who once lived in Iron
ton, Mich., and has forgotten most of
his English, said:
"We go on feet two days; then two
weeks train to see your president.
Tell him I got boy 30 years old in
United States. I like America; .1
think she help us if she only know."
The peasants say tney have only
small mountain farms, and their dis
tricts have no big factories and na
wealth which can attract the Czechs.
Some members of the party visited
the allied commission when' it was at
Lemberg and presented their claims,
but got no definite answer, so now
they are anxious to make President
Wilson referee. i

HARVEY MINSTRELS
BRING 40 SINGERS
The latest patriotic song has not
yet been heard in this community,
but .it will be introduced by the Har
vey Greater Minstrels which are
billed to show at the Grand theater
March 31, and Tuesday, April 1. Im
agine if you can the zest put in these
rousing songs by a company of 40
darkies, all of w hom are singers. It is
doubtful if such singing, so inspiring
has been heard here in recent years,
hence all who attend will feel that
the price they paid for admission was
money well invested especially
when it is ' remembered that in addi
tion to the inspiring singing there
is much dancing that is enthusing,
nine big vaudeville acts which alone
constitute a mighty good show. In
stead of the old worn out colored
after-piece farce for years presented
by minstrels Mr. Harvey has originat
ed something new as a most fit
ting feature with which to close his
excellent minstrel program. We are
not allowed to tell It in advance it is
one of the scores of surprises awaiting
the public in the Harvey Minstrel pro
gram, i
But what will be one of the song
hits of the Harvey Minstrels is the
song "Please Touch My Daddy's Star
and Change It Back to Blue." The
accompanying melody 13 extremely
beautiful and it is one of the score
of tunes that will be whistled on our
streets long after the minstrels are
gone and just as lasting will be the
Impression made by the words.
"She was just a dimpled baby.
Yet a troubled look she wore,
As one tiny finger pointed
To a .flag above the door.
" 'Twas a blue star here for Daddy"
So the lisping accents told,
But they said an angel came last
night
And turned the blue to goia.
(Refrain)
The gold star shines the brightest,,
But it makes my mamma sad.
And I'm sure if my dear Daddy knew
He'd want to be glad.
Oh, Angel, won't you please come back
And bring my Daddy, too.
And pleas touch Daddy's star again
And change it back to blue."
Just a soldier's lonely baby
With a troubled look of care
Do angels weep, I wonder
'"When they hear the baby's prayer:
Won't you please bring back my
Daddy
My dear Daddy, kind and true,
Won't you take away the star of gold
I'd rather have the blue?"

pressively by the ballad singers of

warrant was issued late today for the
arrest of Sergt. Henry Johnson, negro
war hero of Albany, N. Y., on com

who declared Johnson had disparaged
their valor in an address here Friday
night. The warrant is based on the
technical charge of wearing the uni

Johnson is said to have declared the
white were cowards, that they retreat
ed in the face of enemy fire, that the
marines refused to fight in the same
trenches with blacks, and that the war
was won by the negroes.
Following a conference with Col.

withdraw the charges. When the com

latest screen masterpiece, which is dis
tributed by Vitagraph and which will
j be the attraction at the Eagle theater
J last time today, are two of photo-
international reputations on the legiti
mate stage and on the screen.
Mr. Kawlinson, more than six feet
tall and thoroughly masculine, is re
membered specially in this country
as leading man for Geraldine Farrar
in "The .Turn of the Wheel" and also
for his fine work in "Come Through"
and "Kiss or Kill." He was born m
Brighton. England, and was educated
in his native country and in France.
He had considerable stage experience
before coming to the screen. ' Since
entering motion picture circles, Mr.
Rawllnson has played featured roles
in special productions.
Miss Breamer is a native of Au
stralia, where she waa one of the
most popular leading women appear
ing in a number of American produc
tions, including "Bought and Paid
For" and "The Argyle Case." Two
years ago she came to the United
States, in which time she has risen
to stardom.
Her first engagement in this coun

ber of his productions, among them
being 'The Pinch Hitter," "The Mil

"The Narrow Trail," with William S.
Hart.
In addition to beauty and personal
charm, she is an actress of exceptional

Vu. s. Entry in Historic Event

1 gined With Liberty Motors
NEW YORK. March 29. Much in
terest Is being shown throughout the
country' in the race for the honor
of being the first man to fly across
the Atlantic ocean.
Lieut. Com. Patrick N. L. Bellinger
hopes to give America the record for
the first fylng across the Atlantic. His
ship, the N. C. 1, is being made ready
at the United States naval training
station at Rockaway Point, N. Y. Two
others will be ready in reserve, on
the day of the get-away. The NCI is
a biplane with a wing spread of 126
feet 6 inches.' There is 12 feet be
tween upper and lower wings at the
engine section and the width of the
wings Is 12 feet. Three Liberty mo
tors of 400-horsepower each turn the
three propellors. Addition of a fourth
motor is considered.

Allge. Hawker won the world's rec
ord for continuous flight, and the Brlt--ish
Michelin prize for J912. His
time up was 8 hours, 22 minutes.
In the meanwhile the Aero Club of
America has been thrown into a Btate
, of near-panic by cable dispatches that
the British navy has a giant, dirgible
all ready for the flight across the At
lantic. But for labor troubles, accord
ing to the cablegram, the ship would

back again before this. The airship
Is the R-39, constructed by Arm
strong, Whltworth & Co., of Glasgow,
and it may start the trans-Atlantic
voyage any day.
"If America does not look sharp the
trans-Atlantic flight will be made by
the British before we are ready to
launch our own attempts," said Alan
. R. Hawley, president of the Aero
Club.
Officials of the club kave just re
ceived a copy of the British air min
istry, showing that the development
of the lighter-than-air machine has
' been, if possible, more striking than
the heavier-than-alr machine, and that
the dirigible type I3 possibly better
fitted to make the ocean crossing than

The tremendous advance that has
been made in dirigible construction
since the beginning of the war has
made possible the crossing of the At

Wartime Restrictions of Government Should Be Removed
to Encourage Construction, Says Trigg !
By Ernest
President of the National
i
The American, construction indus
try employes more labor than any
other field except agriculture. It pro
duces annually about three thousand
million dollars worth of wealth, tax
paying property. A shortage in this
production increases the cost of liv
ing. The industry is halting. Those en
gaged in it are deeply concerned with
a return, to normal conditions.
During the period of reconstruc
tion it is primarily necessary that all
idle labor and material be engaged for
the future use of the nation. Here
are some of the thoughts briefly
stated which industry has to advance.
It is estimated that the accumu
lations of savings banks and insur
ance companies during the war amount
to form three to five thousand million
dollars, and that tnese, if invested,
would make good our impaired con
I suutuuu laiiuues
struction facilities.
Tne home-building of the country
could be greatly facilitated by th
creation of a home loan bank, similar
to the New York Tan Tianv -a
would permit borrowing by the build-
ing and loan associations at a low
rate of interest upon their securities,

Building Cost up 28.5 per Cent
Building labor throughout the Unl-
ted States is said to have advanced-
rn cost an average of 28.5 per cent
during the war period. It is possible
to reduce labor cost by the elimina
tion of the jurisdictional strike. It
Is estimated that 95 per cent of an
strikes in construction lines and 75
per cent of all delays due to strikes in
this line have been from jurisdictional
causes, which have had nothing to do
with controversies as to wages.
The cost of living has gone up dur
ing the war about 65 per cent, while
the cost of construction has increased
50 per cent to 80 per cent, according to ,
the tyoe of building. I

reeled without delay. That is, a war
schedule of freight rates on certain
materials which was undoubtedly
planned to limit civilian construction
during the war. These rate advances
ranged from 25 per cent ta 150 per
cent.
There are more idle cars" than at
any previous time. To place these
freight rates on a peace basis would
bring the railroads revenue for carry
ing additional materials and also ad
ditional revenue on - a vast quantity
of other traffic which moves .when
construction is going on and men are
earning and spending wages. In nor
mal times 25 per cent of the railroads
tonnage is in construction materials.
Might Waive Taxes
Another means of encouraging build
mg is the possible waiving of all
taxes on such buildings for a period of
years such as may be consistent with
the local needs.
The standards of living in this coun
try are high; it is the judgment of
many thoughtful men in industry that
the purchasing ability of the wage
earner should not be decreased. This
country must, therefore, look to its
natural resources,, to Sts (improved

in an endeavor to reduce heavy
taxation incident to the war. th fpd-

wartime expenditures has apparently
viewed with an eye to economy its
peace construction expenditures.

duct of the steel industry, are in a
period of uncertainty.

Annual Report of American
Smelting and Refining
Company Made
lue annual report, of American
Smelting & Refining company for 1918
did not show up very well In com
parison with previous years, but as an
unfavorable report had already been
discounted, the price of the stock was
not affected.
A feature of the report outside of
the earnings statement was the en
couragement held out for the future
and the especially optimistic remorks
with regard to the company's Mexican
properties.
In 1917 American Smelting rolled up
a balance for its common stock equiva
lent to $24.14 a share, as against
$31.73 a share in 1916. The $5.67 a
share earned last year was the small
est in any year in more than a dfr
cade. J
In 1911 the company changed from
the April 30 fiscal year to the calen
dar year. During that eight-year pe
riod the company showed combined
net earnings available for the com
mon stock of $104.69 a share, or an
average of $13.08 a shafe a year.
American Smelting entered the cop
per refining business in 1901, since
which year it has made big strides
forward. It started with a capacity
of 60,000,000 pounds a year, whereas
at times last year the company was
refining at the rate of 1,000,000,000
pounds yearly. The actual figure of
1,000,000.000 pounds yearly. The ac
tual figure of copper production last
year was 868,540,000 pounds, com
pared with 916,974,000 poundsHn 1917.
The 1918 year was the second best
so far as copper output was concerned
in the history of the company. Back
in 1914 the company turned out but
529.6S6.000 pounds of copper.
The general balance sheet at the
close of 1918 showed the first de
crease in net working capital in many
years, directly due to the sharp in
crease in accounts payable from $20,
919,000 to $26,058,000. Total current
assets on December 31, 1918, were
$43,742,565 and total current liabilities
$30,654,730, leaving a balance of $13,
0S7.835 net working capital. At the
close of 1917 net working capital to
taled $16,972,000 compared with $18,
449.000 on December 31, 1916, and
$17,073000 on the same date in 1915.

T. A. Pickard of San Francisco
Speaker at Northwest
Mine Congress
VANCOUVER, B. C, March 29.
Is "mining an investment, a specu
lation or a gamble?" was the sub
ject of an address made here vester-
Hay before the International North
west Mining congress by T. A. Pickari!
of San Francisco, editor of The Mining
and Scientific? Record. Even the best
mining propositions contain an ele
ment of risk according to Mr. Rickard,
"but," he added, "risk is the very es
sence of mining; it is its life, and the
true miner faces the risk with chetr
ful confidence." Certain promoters he
described as men who tried "to sell
nothing for something to a man who
expects something for nothing. He
said in part:
"The use of money in mining is
seldom an 'investment, usually when
it is meant to be so it affords an ex
ample of the triumph of hope over
experience. I admit that certain forms
of iron and coal mining on a large
scale are characterized by such secur
ity, continuity, and steadiness of in
come as to be 'investments, but the
mining of the so-called base metals or
of the precious metals, in which most
of you are engaged, does not cenie
within the category. In metal mining
the chance of a considerable risk and
of a correspondingly large gain is in
herent. Some of you will demur, you
will point at the Homestake, the Bun
ker Hill and Sullivan, or the - Utah
Copper as examples of an investment,
as representing a type of security so
safe as to be gilt-edged.
"But I submit that in the ear:y
stages of development these splondid
enterprises were speculative, as is sug
gested by the fact that these success
ful ones are a few survivors from the
much larger number that were started
at about the same time and proved
disappointing. I may remind you, to
make my point quite clear, that many
of the famous mines of the world
'broke' those who' first attempted to
bring them to financial success. If
today you were to advise a widow to
put her savings in any one of the three
magnificent mines that I have in
stanced, you would, in my opinion, be
j an unwise counselor, because looking
forward, not backward, for 10 or 20
years, they would represent a specula
tive use of the widow's savings. You
might be sagacious in using your own
money for such a purpose, because
you could take the relatively small
risk for the sake of the probably large
gain, but the widow would be better
advised to buy Liberty bonds."

third floor of the Hotel Crillon, the
workshop of the American commis
sion to negotiate peace. There ahe
commission on the league of nations
drew up its covenant.
There is nothing particularly im
pressive about room 351. It is the kind
of reception room that may be found
in many a French hotel. It is large
and devoratt-'d in the rather elaborate
style. Hut whatever its appeuinm-
may be while it is being used for
everyda purposes, it assumed a whol
ly different look .luring the mi-clings
of the commission.
In the center of the room, a big
round taMe covered with red cloth.
Around the t:ible. 19 chairs for the 19
members of the commisison. Slightly
behind yet scattered through this cir
cle of seats, a number of ether chairs
for French and English translators. u
the corneis. throe or four desks, and
around the wall's occasional chairs for
any secretaries whom the members
might care to bring with them. All in
all. the tables miht have been laid
for a meeting of the cabinet or an
American boaiJ oi directors.
In this rc:oni the commission met
10 times during 11 clays. They came to
gether in the morning, afternoon or
evening at hours which would not con
flict with the program of the peace
conference itself whose work en
visaged their own. or with that of the
supreme war council, then engaged up
on pressing ciuesiions relating to the
renewal of the armistice.
No Time Set tor Day's WorK
It might be figured out that the
meetings averaged three hours in
length; but it is hardly appropriate
to speak of averages in this connec
tion. No time was set by the commis
sion for the termination of the day's
work. There was a job to be done,
and a man's own time was a secondary
consideration. Nobody looked at the
clock.
It appears inconceivable that a con
stitution of the league of nations
could have been drawn in 30 hours.
It was done, but the buhl statement
is misleading, for it fails to take cer
tain things into account. It says noth
ing for instance, of a single expedient
by which the task of the commission
was cut clearly in half.
Whether one spoke in English or in
French, it made no difference. As he
talked there might be heard the low
hum of interpreters translating his re
marks word by word and phrase by
phrase.
Every moment of the "0 hours was
maed to work, and no time was lost in
the slow but prevailing process of re-
translation.
It fails likewise to reckon in all the
thought which had previously been
given to the subject. Each one of the
statesmen sat around the table and
had formulated definite ideas on the
subject, and came to the conferences
with an illuminated and active mind.

JVEWS- OF SOCIAL CIRCLES
RED CROSS TO AWARD
FAITHFUL WORKERS.
The American Re dCross is planning! .
to reward the men an J women who!
worke dfaithfully during the
of the war. Not only those who have
gone overseas or worked in camp and
canteen at the army- camps, but those
who - gauze dressings, fashioned gar
ments for refugees or did any kind
of real work in the service of the Red
Cross are to be considered by the or
ganization as candidate for the decor
ation provided they can show that
the yhave given the reqrred number.
of hours to the task.
But the dignity of the service must
be jrotected. There must be a appar
ent fairness in making the awards if
the distinction i sto have its full sig
niiicai.ct. No mere perfunctory at
tendance at meetings is to be counted
as work and no recognition is granted
for pervfci- prior to tiie eate of April
C, 1917.

the league idea. Leon Bourgeois, well
advanced in years of service at The
Hague conferences in the interests of
peace, had with him Larnaude, dean of
the faculty of law at the Pahis School
of Law. Orlando, Italy's vivid prime
minister and an eminent jurist as well,
had Senator Scialoja as his colleague
in expressing the mind of the govern
ment at Rome; while aBron Makino,
Japanese foreign minister, and Vis
count Chinda, her ajnbassador at Lon
don, contributed the keen and quiet
opinion of the far eastern country.
Though these five powers were each
represented by two members on the
commission, its deliberations were not
dominated by their views. There also
sat down to the table Hymans, the
Belgian foreign minister; Senator
Pessoa, of Brazil; V. K. Wellington
Koo, China's minister at Washington;
Ivramarz. prime minister of the
Czechoslovak republic; Venizelos,
prime minister of Greece; Dmowski,
president of the Polish National com
mittee; Jayme Batalha Reis, Portu
guese minister to Petrograd; Dia
mandy, minister plenipotentiary of Ru
mania, and Vesnitch, Serbian minister
at Paris.
They included representatives of the
east. South America, and the oldest
and the newest state of : Europe. This
striking group of statesmen, so keenly
interested that they presented an uu
broken record of attendance- at the
meetings, contributed to the discus
sions a force and vision which rivaled
that of the greater powers.
' No Shirkers at Meetings
The meetings were business-like to
a degree. The members invariably
came together on the hour, exchanged
a world' of greetings as they made
their way to their seats, took the docu
ments of the day out of their portfol
ios, and proceeded with the netx arti
cle. Each of them found on the table
before him all new papers upon whic
discussion might depend. Every day,
as the commission made progress
through the draft, there was laid at
each place a revised copy indieatiuo
just what - had been accomplished on
the day before. If there were amend
ments to be proposed by any member.
he saw to it IJiat they were typewrit
ten and distributed so that each of his
colleagues might examine their merits
in advance.
The meetings were marked ' by ex
treme simplicity. Diplomatic dress
had disappeared with Vie diplomacy of
the past. Each manrVore what was
convenient-dirmer -frtrar, "morning coat
or business suit and the business
suit prevailed. There was none oi
that sense of the overwhelming sig
nifiance of the task which is some
times the death of decision. hTey went
about the matter in a commonplace
way..
President Wilson presided over e-r-ery
meeting except the last.
The first meeting was very brief.
The commission came together; the
president spoke a few words and laid
before them a draft plan which they
agreed to use as the basis of discus
sion. So day after day the draft was
held up to the light and criticized and
amplified. At the end of the eighth
meeting, the first reading was com-ccmpleted.
Though the project emerged un
changed in principle, the draft Lad
been altered in many details and there
were before the commission various
proposed amendments and changes in
phraseology. It was decided to put
the covenant into the hands of a draft
ing committee composed of MM. Lar
naude, Lord Robert Cecil, Venizelos
and Vesnitch for a thorough overhaul
ing. U. S. Soldiers Set Type
Late the following evening their
work was finished, and the printing
press was -busy all through the night.
so that the amended draft might be
on the table the next morning. In ad
dition to the satisfaction of a job well
done, the American soldiers who set
the type and corrected proof and ran
the press, will treasure the letter of
thanks which the president sent them
before he sailed.

DANCE
CHICAGO, March 29. Although
corn averaged lower in price most of
the time today, week-end covering by
shorts gave the market a rapid upturn
in the last hour. Closing quotations
were strong, 1 to 2c net higher, with
May $1.47l-47, and July fl.37

provisions 30c to 90c.
Before the rally at the finish in the
corn market .liquidation by many
holders had taken place, and there
had been a great deal of short selling.
Likelihood that the big Argentine ex
portable surplus would ssrve as a con
tinued threatening bearish factor was
apparently the chief 'source of depres
sion. Besides, purchasing orders J
seemed to nave been reauee-j to a j
minimum, owing to the interruption of j

ever, and shorts trying to cover were
forced to bid the market up on them
selves in a hurry.
, Buying on the part f a leading
speculator sent oats up with corn.
There was also talk of export busi
ness at the seaboard.
Provisions received an upward im
petus from word that the government
had given a huge order for lard com
pound. Indications, too, were for a
lessened number of hog receipts next
week. '

WEEKLY FINANCIAL REVIEW.
NEW YORK, March 29. Regardless
of conflicting., reports from abroad,
much of this week's trading in stocks
at higher prices was traceable to the
conviction that events at the peace
conference are progressing favorably.
. Quite as important ia shaping the
character of the trading were the
unmistakable signs of future impetus
in several important Branches of in
dustry, as seen in the wider inquiry
for finished and semifinished steel
and a concurrent demand for cop
per. The United- States Steel annual re
port is to issue early in the coming
week, and it is expected to throw a
strong light on its vast financial re
sources. To bankers the most significant
feature of the February foreign trade
report embraced the agricultural pro
ducts, which were greater by $76,000,-
000 than in the same month of 1918.

further depreciation in the value of
pouuus sterling, irancs ana lires, re
mittances to London approximating

conditions, from which no immediate
relief is expected.
