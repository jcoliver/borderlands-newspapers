GERMANS RETIR
THAT ALLIED
TOUCH IN
Northern Belgium Being Evacuated, Leaving Lille and Other
Important Centers of France in Huge Salient Germans Can
not Possibly Hope to Hold; Belgian Troops Prove Selves
Invincible in Face of Galling Fire, While French Cavalry,
Assisted by British and French Infantry, Does Fine Work
WITH THE ALLIED ARMIES IN BELGIUM, Oct. 16
(By the Associated Press) 4:30 p. m. The Germans have
started a retreat on a tremendous scale from northern Belgium.
French cavalry is approaching Thielt, seven miles from the
banks of the Ghent-Bruges canal. The canal itself is only ten
miles from the border of Holland. So fact is the enemy re
treating that the French, British and Belgian infantry, at least
in the center of the battle front, have lost touch entirely with
the enemy. 1
The Belgians advancing astride the Thou rout-Bruges and
Thorout-Ostend roads have defeated the Germans, who are re
treating rapidly. -
This undoubtedly is one of the war's greatest and most
vital victories, for the gallant little Belgian army, ably assisted
by crack French and British troops now has driven the despoil
'ers of its country from a large section which the Germans
have occupied since the early days of the war and has gained
positions of such importance that the Germans may have to
abandon the entire coast of Belgium.
Moreover the sweeping advance of the allied infantry,
preceded by a fan of French cavalry advancing rapidly, has
left the entire area in which are the important city of Lille and
the great mining and manufacturing districts of Tourcoing,
Roubaix and Tournai, in a salient which is growing deeper
every hour and which the enemy cannot hope to hold.
The French cavalry. which Is
on
the crest of the allied advance, has
done marvelous work. Today it gal
loped ' forward more than ten kilome
ters, frequently carrying out charges
with a dash usually associated with
cavalry upon isolated posts of enemy
machine gunners which .vainly at
tempted to hold up its advance. Some
of these gunners, taken prisoner said
they were totally unable to under
stand why the war was going on and
why they were called upon to con
tinue fighting. One officer said:
"We have offered all the terms in
the world for peace; nobody seems
willing to accept them."
Resistance where it has been of
fered by the enemy has been extraor
dinarily fierce, for in these places it
obviously has been the purpose of the
commanders of the fleeing Germans
to gain time in which to remove their
materials. Stubborn fighting has been
reported, especially from the region
of Thourout. The battle here has
been from street to street and house
to house, and large numbers of the
enemy have been killed. Some Bel
gian forces have swept around the city
in order to cut the roads at the rear
and also assist in bottling up the
enemy trying to hold out in the city
Itself.
The Germans had placed machine
guns in the windows of houses and
cellars and fired murderous streams
of bullets into the advancing Belgians,
but were unable to stop them. The
Belgians fought with a dogged de
termination Biuh as only troops fight
ing to regain their outraged country
could display. Nothing could stop
them.
The British, following up the re
treating Germans and overcoming the
rear guards, are reported as reaching
Quesnoy and as having captured Lin
eelles, along the Lys.
The lielgians at the time this dis
patch was filed were reported to be
past Keyem and to have reached po
sition! on the other side of Cachten
and Ardoye. both of which they cap
tured. Northeast of Courtral, Bavic
hove was stormed and taken and the
Belgians were still going.

(Uy Review rasttl Wirj)
WASHINGTON, Oct. 16. With the
Berlin-Constantinople railroad cut by
allied occupation of Nish, Germany is
relying upon its Black sea fleet to hold
Turkey in line. Information has been
received at the state department that
the Turkish government has been told
by Berlin "that the fleet will open fire
on the Ottoman capital at the first

This German fleet consists largely
of warships captured from the Rus

enough to control, for the present at
least, the Turkish government. It was
pointed out today that with the Bri

and Mesopotamia of Turkish control,
Turkey must hold to Constantinople
as its only hope of maintaining any
power as a government.

BRITISH HEADQUARTERS IN
FLANDERS, Oct. 16. (Reutera.)
Throughout last night in the moon
light the allies continued tirelessly
to follow up their splendid successes
in Belgium.
At 9 a. m. today Belgian cavalry
patrols were reported to be within a
kilometer of Thielt. Previously cavalry
had been reportec to be working to
ward Thourout. The allies were said
to be more than half way through
the Wynendael wood acd the infantry
to have reached a point near Lychter
velde, where they were said to be ad
vancing all along the northern out
skirts of Courtrai and through the cen
ter of Isegbem.
Last night, the Franco-Belgians in
fantry were on the general line of
Boscheeweter, EUenwalle, Zwcartegal
and Hacntze, thence to a point luOO
yards east of the Thourout-Roulers
road, and to the Wynendael station by
Beve to the south of Isegbem. the
Lendelede station, Hulote and Bavia
chove to Harlebecke.
This morning the capture of Bos
cheeweter and Edenwalle seemed to
have been continued, and Frenoh
troops were reported to be along the
railway west of Lichtervelde. ingei
munster apparently has been occupied,
and the Courtrai railway reached east
of Cappelle Ste Catherine.
The British were reported to be
across tne Lys east of Cuminea. with
their posts established beyond Labas
serville. Yesterday the Germans attacked
from Iseghem and forced the Belgian
line back to Boschmoleus. but a coun
ter attack drove them to and beyond
their starting point. Prisoners and
guns continue to be gathered in. but
there has been no time to count the
latest captures.
Between Lena and Armeutieres the
Germans continue to fall back and the
British are drawing near Lille. During
the night they crossed the Haute
Deule canal, 2000 yards east of Port-A-Vendin,
and threw out a screen of
strong patrols which have maintained
harassing touch with the enemy. The
British are reported to be holding

ARCHANGKL, Tuesday, Oct. 15.
(By the Associated Press.) Allied
lorces, including Americans, are en
gaged in repulsing heavy Bolsheviki
attacks on both banks of tne Dvina,
150 miles north Ketlass, in the nortn
Hussian lighting zone.
The Americans and Russians have
advanced in the direction ot Welsk,
northeast ot Vologda.
The Bolsheviki are striving to re
gain the positions which were won
after hard fought Btrutses by Amer
icans and Scotch on September 21.
Under an almost constant bombard
ment for more than a week the allies
have repulsed many Infantry attacks
and Inflicted considerable losses.
These positions include Tillages on
opposite sides of the tnina river, both
of which are on a high bluff at a
strategic bend in the stream. 'Around
this bend Bolsheviki gunboats, pro
tected by mine fields and a low, sandy
island, bave delivered a bombardment
with shells of all calibers.
The allies, meanwhile have been
forced to strive against the rapidly
falling river, which Is full of sand
bars. The garrison, though greatly
outnumbered in men and artillery,
have struggled waist deep in the.
swamps and knee deep in the muddy
roads, capturing several guns and ma
chine guns. American engineers, a
lieutenant and a few men crossed th$
river under a heavy fire and rescued
a gun from a disabled tug oa which
the Bolsheviki had centered their fire.
The next day tbe same lieutenant with
a sergeant -braved the same dangers
in an effort to repuir tugs caught un
der a heavy shower of shrapnel fire.
They tried to swim for the shore, but
were swept away by the swift current
and drowned.
The Bolsheviki now are trying to
spread their propaganda among the
allied troops. Captured trenches and
villages on the Dvina front were full
of proclamations printed in English,
asking the British and Americans not
to fight. These proclamations were
laughed at by the British and Ameri
cans and are particularly inconsistent
with the Bolsheviki treatment of pris
oners, whom they many times have
mutilated.

SO RAPIDLY THAT

(Continued from Pure One)
uable, for the place being northwest
of Turcoing the allied troops are grad
ually outflanking the entire Lille sa
lient, from which there are further
signs that the enemy is withdrawing.
As a matter of fact, his troops In this
salient are in an extremely precarious
position. They must get out rapidly
or face disastrous consequences.
A thousand more prisoners and
many more cannon bave been cap
tured. The Germans at many places,
especially in the northern part of the
battle area, seem to be surrendering
freely. Many more civilians have
been rescued from the towns and dis
tricts captured and little processions
of these are straggling rearward out
of range of the guns and out. of the
way of the fighting troops. Stories
are beginning to come back how lib
erated Belgian women have seen their
eons, brothers or husbands going for
ward into battle.
Quite a number of civilians also
have been rescued from Roulers and
its environs, the Germans having left
in such a hurry that they Jiad not
time to remove the civilians who
wanted to stay and take a chance of
being liberated. Today these men
women and children are again walk
ing on the free soil of France.
The Germans appear to be making
strenuous efforts to save ttieir muni
tion and equipment and their ma
terial, the accumulation of four years,
from the coast districts of Belgium.
The roads behind the Germans are
littered with all sorts of transports
and allied airplanes are again playing
havoc with the retreating enemy.
The weather today was cloudy, but
thus far no more rain has fallen.
However, Klandcrs is mud from one
end to 1l;e other and this condition
makpf. movement difficult for the al
lied troops. The oozp and soft ground
mr.ke It doubly difficult for the enemy
to move back. TfcereiVre, the allied
soldiers have put up with great hard
ships for they realize that they have
the enemy on the run- in the most
vital section of th west front and
do not desire to let him have a chance
to reassemble his tattered units. Out
side Courtrai the infantry has prog
icssed about three miles and here
have i.een compelled to fight their
way urv.-ard. for the Germans had
orders to hold on to the last an'l
thoy d'd no. Not many of those who
had ben s'ationed wilh machine Suns
to try to hold up the advance of the
allied troops managed to escape.
At tlie Thielt positions the French I
cavalry Jibs begun to come into a
country where the ground and roails
are harder, allowing them to operate
more freely. It is through this gap
that the Germans throughout the en
fire Bdeidn coast system must go if
they wish to save thenmelv;, pro
viding, of course, tbe advance con
linue. Incidentally every yard of ad
vance here narrows the enemy's es
cape gap
It would seem that If the weather
hojda out long enough and the ad
vance continues at the present rate
ot speed the Germans will soon have
lost control of great stretches of Bel
glum, especially the cost, which is im
portant for submairnes, aside from
stretches of northern France from
where, all rules of tactics and strategy
demand, they must evacuate as being
outflanked with their lines turned.
So far as is known, the Germans have
not any formidable lines in their rear
where they can find refuge.
Moreover, the German high com
mand Is not in a position to send re
inforcements of any consequence1 to
Flanders, as they are all needed and
fully occupied elsewhere along the
front. " . '
SIGNS OF RfcTREAT.
(By Review Leased Wire)
WITH THE ALLIED ARMIES IN
BELGIUM, Oct. 16. (By the Asso
ciated Press.) There are many signs
that the Germans are planning a
further withdrawal on this sector.
Great streams of enemy traffic began
moving last night and continued to
day on the roads around Courtrai anl
Harlebeke and on the railways run
ing northeast.
Trench mortars and direct machine
gun tire are hampering the enemy
transport. The German withdrawal
continues in the Lille sector, but
slowly.
Ia the southern battle area there
has been fighting of a minor char
acter. More civilians have been
rescued from towns, especially from
Haussy. j j
The British have established a
bridge head south of the Lys near
Werwlcosout. After fighting all night
and smashing forward for a gain of
7.OU0 yards, onte British corps con
tinued its advance until it reached
the banks of the Lys south of Court
rai. Another corps established itself
between Heule and Courtrai.
The village of Heetjen was cap
tured after severe fighting in which
the Germans suffered tremendous
losses.

REASON FOU RETREAT.
(By Review Leased Wire)
WITH THE FRENCH ARMY IN
FRANCE. Oct. 16. By the Associated
Press.) The entire subsistence of the
German armies between Cambrai and
the Meuse must pass through two
narrow routes by way of Hirson and
Mezieres. These are the two lines
upon which tbe security of the Ger
man armies now depends, and it is
toward those two lines that the
French and Americans in Champagne,
and the British and French region of
Cambrai and Guise, have been ad
vancing. The most plausible reason ' for a
general retreat of the German armies
is tho necessity of reaucing the dis
tance between them and two points,
both of which are alrSady remotely
threatened, and to parry the danger
of their being bottled up and cap
tured. The only alternative would

GERMANS FEARFUL
OF ALLIED ARMS
RtACHiNG KOMEi
WITH THE FRENCH ARMY IN
THE LA ON AREA. Oct. 16 (By the
Associated Press). The first news
that reached the inhabitants of Laoi
- of the radical change in the military
situation came from German officers,
who had, after the victories of the al
lies, already ceased to agree with the
Berlin military' critics, whose articles
proclaiming eGrniany unbeaten are be
ing circulated by wireless. With an
utter lack of caution which the hearei
tock as a betrayal of despair, these of
ficers opened their minds and bared
their hearts in tlie presence of people
who had felt their oppression for four
years.
Pefore a man In whose house they
were billeted, and wfco understood the
German language, officers declared:
"The central empires are no longer
able to stand out against the whole
world. Hard times are in store for
the fatherland unless peace is ob
tained promptly."
Without a word of regret for op
pression of the people whose roofs
tad sheltered them, they talked with
unconcealed anguish cf the possibility
that their own people might feel the
hardships of invasion.
These direct confessions of defeat,
contradicting the reports of the Berlin
writers that the German retreat was
purely a tactical retirement are sup
ported by material facts not open to
controversion, such as 4600 cannon
captured during the three months of
Vie allied offensive, or about one
fourth of the entire armament of the
German artillery, and a quarter-million
of prisoners taken during the same
time on the western front alone.
The Germans had about ISO divis
ions on this front on March 1 to which
were added about thirty-two divisions
; relieved from the Russian front. The
German force has maintained in the
v neighborhood of 205 divisions from
April to September through drafts on
the reserve denots. The wastage be
gan to tell after the battles cf July
and August.
On September 13 the Germans hart
onth's front 200 divisions, including
Austrian reinforcements. Shortening
their line had, however, enabled them
to constitute a reserve of divisions.
The battles of September and the
first days of October reduced their re
serves to abcut thirty divisions, about
half of 'which had been recently re
tired from the front to be reconstruc
ted. Twenty divisions had disappeared
entirely by October 10. through pro
gressive dissolutions that had been
confirmed from trustworthy sources.
On that date the enemy had scarcely
a dozen divisions in reserve that might
be called fresh.
The wastage in armament is not
only in cannon captured by the allies
but in diminished production by rea
son of drafts made unon war indus
tries to reinforce the field forces and
strikes.
PEACE RUMORS
AGITATE CITIES
OF ALL EUROPE
(Continued from Pajce On)
an Amsterdam date line said the Nieu
we Rotterdamsche Courant had issued
a special edition in which the report
was published that Germany had capi
tulated and Emperor William had ab
dicated. Another dispatch, under Lon
don date line, quoted Reuter's Limited,
as reporting that the German reply to
the president's most recent note was j
expected to be communicated immedi-,
ately and that it was likely to consti- i
tute a general acceptance of the con-
ditions outlined by the president as j
precedent to peace. Reports also were .
received in London, dispatches said, '
through diplomatic channels from Hoi-'
land that the German reply probably
will be sent today and that it would
be an acceptance of President Wil
son's terms with some stipulation to
.the effect that the interest of the Ger
man people must be respected. !
Later th.1 Nieuwe Rotterdamsche
Courant withdrew its statement re

porting capitulation and abdication of
the kaiser, while the British official
press bureau announced it had been
officially Informed that such rumors
had no foundation in fact.
There is in Washington no official
v.crd that the kaiser has abdicated or
thai he has been overthrown: or that
Germany is ready to accept all of
President Wilson's terms.
Officials and diplomatists, cautious
and conservative by nature and prac
tice,'1 regard with incredulity the inti
mations that cne or all of these things
has happened. Of course, they all
hope they have; they all know that
one or all of the mare inevitable.
The official opinion in the capital
tonight is that the coming of these
things is. timed only by the unknown
degree td which the German military
poweV has been broken. There may
be .more information on that point in
the chancellories of the allies han
there is In Washington.
When President Wilson's reply to
the German peace profer went forward
Monday uight, it was predicted here
that if it did not bring a complete
and unconditioual surrender of the
military autocracy the German people
themselves would force one. President
Wilson's words w'ere a plain invitation
to the German people to take such a
step and an ultimatum that there
would be no peace with kaiserism.
The coming hours will show how
the leaven has worked; the intima
tions in today's dispatches from Lon
don, Paris and Holland suggest the
progress of the ferment
Most significant of all Is regarded
the report from Holland by way of
London that Germany will immediately
reply to President Wilson, accepting
all his terms and asking only guaran
tees for the Interests of Cermany and
the German people.
When the German reply to Presi
dent Wilson's note comes this gov
ernment's only course is to forward
it to the co-belligerents. Guarantees
for the Interests of Germany and the
German people, which may be asked,
will not intervene as an obstacle if
guarantees are sought in sincere
terms. If they are put forth as an
other vehicle for a quibble, an oppor
tunity of diplomatic evasion and
trickery, or a negotiated peace, they
will meet only one reply.
If they mean guarantees for the in
tegrity and sovereignty of the Ger
many which is rightfully german, al
ways taking in the determinations of
the human beings concerned, no ob
stacle is foreseen. If they mean guar
antees for the right cf tiie German
people to live their lives under a peace
ful responsibile government which
does not menace the life of the world.
President Wilson's utterances on the
subject, officials believe already have
given the answer.
Guarantees for the interests of
Germany, involving only Germans, it
was pointed out, are quite apart from
the self-determinaticn of the oppress
ed nationalities in Austria for which
President Wilson has pledged the
peace conference to secure opportun
ity for an autonmous development.
There always is the possibility that
the condition President Wilson has
laid down as the basis for a peace al
ready have come about in Germany.
Diplomats noticed that Chancellor
Max sent a note and that when Presi
dent Wilson answered with an inquiry,
it was Foreign Minister. Solf and not
the chancellor who replied and that
Solf spoke of a new government which
htad been formed In Germany. It
would not be without precedent if
the peace party in Germany actually
was in possession of an Imperial re
script or other secret act renouncing
the power of the kaiser and his party,
when the reply to President Wilson's
inquiry was sent. It would not be
without precedent if the negotiation
was begun with a maneuver for the
best possible terms and holding back
the last card the downfall of kaiser
ism.
If the conditions for an armistice arfi
accepted tho arrangements will be
made not ffy a mixed commission, but
by Marshal Foch and the co-belliger
ent commanders. These will he the
means of taking from Germany every
agency with which she could break
her word if she would; the occupa
tion by allied forces of such places a.
Strassburg, Metz and Coblenz; turning
over to the allies of her fleet and
submarine bases; with the recall of
her submarines which today's dis
patches hinted she was ready to do,
and the surrender of munitions of war,
undoubtedly also the agencies by
which others might be produced and
probably the employment of the great
war machine plants of Germany to re
pair the Industrial damage done in
on Draught
Belgium and France. Seeing is be
lieving, one official declared tonight,
and there will be no scrap of paper.
In a military sense Germany would
be treated as an Indivhlunl prisoner of
war disarmed and guarded. Allied
forces ulaced in strategic positions
could then, by invasion of Germany
if necessary, enforce any terms. The
allied war council in which President
Wilson holds one vote has agreed
upon these conditions as guarantees
for the supremacy of the allied arm
ies. It can be stated with official auth
ority that should Germany agree to
such an armistice, the downfall of
military oligarcy could be arranged
easily at the peace conference with
out danger of accepting a "negotiated
peace." Allied forces would be in a
position to enforce the decisions
the peace council.
The chief question in the minds of
public men tonight is: is the Ger
man military power really so broken
as to be ready to accept the allies'
I terms?
Throughout the- American capita'
there Is jrn air of calm, determined
confidence. People are reading the
news bulletins at the windows and
buying Liberty bonds at the curbs.
WITHDRAWS RUMOR STORY
AMSTERDAM, Oct. 15. The Nieuwe
Rotterdamsche Courant has withdrawn
its statement reporting the capitula
tion of Germany and the abdication of
Emperor William.
This step was taken, the newspaper
says, because It was unable to obtain
iny confirmation of the report.
NOTHING TO REPORT
LONDON, Oct. 16. The official
press bureau Is officially Informed
that the reports published this after
noon to the effect that Germany had
capitulated have no foundation In fact.
GERMAN PAPERS HOPELESS
AMSTERDAM. Oct. 16. The Co
logne Gazette, which often speaks au
thoritatively, oommentlng on Presi
dent Wilson's reply to Foreign Min
ister Solf. says:
"After President Wilson's note, hope
for peace must be lowered a few pegs."
The Cologne Volkes Zeitung takes
the same stand.
WASHINGTON IS INTERESTED
WASHINGTON, Oct. 16. No offi
cial information concerning the report
that Germany is about to accept the
peace conditions of President Wil
son's note had been received this ev
ening at tie state department or al
lied embassies. Press dispatches on
the subject were read eagerly and de
velopments of the next few hours were
awaited with profound interest.
GERMAN PRESS DISAPPOINTED
BMtNE, Switzerland, Oct. 16. Ger
man newspapers received here gener
ally reflected considerable disappoint
ment over President Wilson's latest
note. The liberal newspapers ex
press the fear that President Wilson's
"new conditions" may fortify the'eon
servatives and Pan-Germp.ns in a pol
icy or desperate resistance.
HUN PAPER COMMENTS
AMSTERDAM, Oct. 16. The semi
official North German Gazette of Ber:
lin says:
"President Wilson's reply has partly
carried the discussion farther and part
ly extended it.
"A fresh counter utterance by the
i Geruian government therefore, Is nec
i essary, so that the bringing about of
an armistice and the inauguration of

terial gains in the process of driv
ing the invader from Belgian soil. On
the front in France the British, French
and Americans are here after the Ger
mans and are making progress al
though slowly, notwithstanding the
strenuous defense that is being of
fered. Both in Serbia and Albania the en
tente troops are ridding the invaded
districts of the Austro-Hungarian and
Germancontingents, in Albania being
well to the north of Durazzo on the
Adriatic sea and in Set bid a con
siderable distance beyond Nish with
the enemy falling back toward the
frontier of Austria-Hungary.
In the Palestine theater the British
cavalry has driven far to the north
and northwest of Damascus, having
reached Tripolinear the Mediterran
ean coast, forty-five miles north of
Beirut, and Horns, eighty-five miles
north of Damascus. By this maneuver
there seemingly is created for the Ot
toman forces the menace of again be
ing caught between General Allenby's
arnivs and crushed, as was the case
in the early days of the offensive in
the region north of Jerusalem. The
maneuver also may forecast a new
drive by the British from the Bagdad
region to form a junction with Gen
eral Allen by at Aleppo and thus take
the Holy Laud in its entirety from
the Turks.
The great wedge of the allies in
Flanders is being gradually extended
eastward along the front of attack.
Tbourout, at the head of the railway
i leading to Bruges and numerous vil
. Iage3 to the south have been taken,
while Courtrai, the junction point of
1 the railway to Ghent, is almost entire

jand British troops who are carrying
out the operation.
To the south of this region the Bri

GERMANS MAKE STAND
WITH THE FRENCH ARMY ON
THE AISNE, Oct. 16, (By the Associ
ated Press, 2:30 p. m.) Favored by
the bad weather and bad roads wnich
are slowing up the advance of the
allied supply trains, the Germans ap
pear disposed to make a stand, for the
time at least, on the line from the re
gion north of Si.ssonne to Rethel.
General Debeney's forces have made
a slight advance west of Anguilcourt,
passing the Serre, and arriving before
the marshes which the enemy is utiliz
ing with the aid of a well sustained
machine gun fire to stop their for
ward march. The German artillery has
also increased in its activity in this
sector.
North of Sissonne the French troops
now are along the bank of the Drain
age canal which constitutes the ad
vance defense positions prepared
there as a secondary line of retire
ment from the Hindenburg line.
Further east the Germans, support
ed by a violent artillery fire, counter
attacked the French troops under the
command of General Guillaumat. This
reaction was of no avail. General Guil
laumat's men maintaining their line a
quarter of a mile east of the road
from St. Germainmont to Gerzicourt.
General Gouraud took Acy, on the
south bank of the Aisne southwest of
Rethel. The Germans are shelling the
rear areas all along the line and ap
pear to be reinforcing their Lne
strongly with machine guns.
YANKS TAKE GRAND PRE
WITH THE AMERICAN ARMY
NORTHWEST OF VERDUN. Oct. 16,
(6 p. m., by the Associated Press.)
The American troops today occupied
the town of Grand Pre on the north ;
bank of the Aire river, north of the j
Argonne forest. '
Since early last night rain has fallen
over the entire field of combat, con j
verting roads and trenches into mud- j
dy canals.
Aviation was impossible today and j
the artillery fire was directed entire- j
ly by maps, except in rare instances j
when direct fire was used. j
Grand Pre is only a village and its !
normal population is less than 15u0 !
but the place is of great strategic im-1
portance. It is the junction of the
railways feeding a great part of the
German army and lies at the toot of
the valley extending northward, at
the entrance to which Germans have
fought so stubbornly.

A sunset benediction
Resaid in afterglow
A memory of the gladdest thing

A Prophet carried upward
In chariot of fire
The morning stars together
Singing in holy choir
All things to love belonging
In light made manifold
And just a maple passing
In autumn cloth of gold.

. The Tide of Battle
That sector from Dixmude to Lens is the
most important now along the battle line..
The British east of Cambrai will have to
wait for their transport and heavy guns be
fore battering down the new German line
from Valenciennes to Hirson. The French
are still pressing cn in the Champagne and
making most important gains, but they are
still several miles from the Hirson-Metz
line. But the drive to outflank the Belgian
seaports on the north and Lille on the
south has now reached a point where every
mile gained means either retirement or dis
aster to the German armies in the north.
The wedge here is very deep and its shadow
falls alike upon Bruges and upon Lille:
Bruges is the key to the seaports and Lille
is the northern pillar of the line upon which
the Hun hopes to stand for a time.
Foch is almost sure to keep up the pres
sure unrelentingly in Belgium until both
Bruges and Lille are taken. These are his
present objectives. And while he strikes
here the French and Americans in the
Champagne and along the Meuse will
threaten just enough to keep Ludendorff
from sending a man or a gun to ave Bel
gium. And in the center of the line, east
of Cambrai, Haig's army is gathering itself
together for a blow at Valenciennes.
But King Albert of Belgium holds the
stage at this time, and he ha3 his own sol
diers, all there are left, and a French
and a British army at his disposal, and Foch
genius to direct and the prayers of the allied
world and the salvation of Belgium to spur
him on. Be sure he will do all that mortal
can do to drive out the invader this year.
The Americans
Americans of the first army have been
having a terrible time on that narrow front
northwest of Verdun, between the Argonne
forest and the Meuse. Over three weeks
ago they swept forward in an offensive at
this point. The first two days they ad
vanced some seven miles; the next nine
teen days they advanced about two miles.
And they are fighting still, every day, the
fiercest, hottest, most gruelling kind of bat
tles. The French to the east of us, who
advanced only three miles the first two
days, are now some eighteen miles deep in
the enemy positions. But before we judge
of the lack of courage, force or success of
the American units on this sector, let us
consider the battle here from every angle.
In the first place, the ground to negotiate
at this place is most difficult, consisting of
woods, hills, ravines and every species of
fearful terrain. But then the French had
hard ground, too, just to the west. But the
French did not have to face the determined
and desperate opposition that the Ameri
cans have met ever since the second day of
their drive. The Germans threw in divis
ion after division on this front and have
counter attacked scores of times. This
ground close -to the Meuse is probably as
precious to them as any foot of soil in
France. Hie Yanks straddle the Meuse at
this place and ihcir advance six miles fur
ther will play more havoc with the German
battle line than any six mile advance be
tween the sea and the Swiss border. Hence
the resistance here. The Krembilde linn
forms one of the defenses in this sector, and
at last, the Yanks have pierced it. Pershing
still battles desperately on. All day Tues
day they fought in an inferno of battle. Let
us remember also that, slow as is their gain,
they are engaging and holding many divis
ions of picked Hunnish troops here and all
the artillery and machine gun power the
German staff can muster at a given spot.
Let us remember also, that there are about
1 00,000 American troops with General
Gouroud's army, and another one hundred
thousand with Mangin in the Laon sector
and still another hundred thousand under
Haig in the glorious Cambrai sector, and
that we have released about a half-million
French soldiers between Verdun and Switz- ,
erland for most important duty elsewhere
along the line. The American part in the
war grows by bounds every week, and the
American skill and courage and dash and
dependability in a crisis have come already
to be a classic in warfare with our seasoned,
veteran friends, the English and the French.
No figures are available lately, but we must
have at least a million men on the French
battle line, and of these a half million are
actively engaged and the other half-million
are holding the quiet sectors from Verdun
southward.
LET FOCH ALONE
(Worcester, Mass., Telegram.)
There is but one condition that can save
the Hun from the grinding destruction of
General Foch's terrible advance an arm
istice. ... Let Foch alone and noth
ing can step his entry into Berlin. No
armistice.
The allies have penetrated from ten to
twenty-five miles eastward of the Hinden
burg line, but then the Germans only this
year crossed this line westward the same
distance and still we survived and came
back. Germany has lost Bulgaria and will
soon lose the Turk, but then we lost Rus
sia and Rumania and survived. From a
strictly military standpoint it is no darker
for Germany in October than it was for the
allies in June. But, of course, . Germany
has not the control of the seas nor the re
sources to draw upon which the allies have
always had since America entered the war.
But at that, there is nothing to build a vic
torious peace upon short of the fall of next
year unless Germany elects to throw up rier ;
hands and quit." If she is as game in spirit
as the allies have always been, she has the
men and means to keep us out of Germany
this year and offer a fierce resistance for
some months of next year. If there were an
other two or three months of fighting
weather directly ahead at this time Foch
might well score the knockout in that pe
riod, but there are only about two weeks
ahead in which to fight, unless the fall in
France is unusually open and mild. Thus
Germany will have all winter in which to
recoup and rehabilitate her armies. From a
military standpoint Germany is still strong.
From a moral and industrial standpoint, no
one knews just how much more she can
stand.
The machine gun seems to be the Ger
man's sole standby in time of trouble. But
for this little instrument his armies at Cam
brai, Lron and in the Champagne, would
surelr have met with disaster. As long as
the' German staff can find thousands of
brave and skilful men with each German
army to drop back and give their lives via
the machine gunner route, that long will
the Germans be able to retreat in some
order. And so far these men have been
found. The rule of the great war for two
years past has been to bayonet the machine
gunner who holds out past a certain time
against an enemy advance. The Germans
must have a countless store of machine
guns. These guns are very delicate mech
anisms and must be as durable and strong
as they are perfect m smallest Retail. Time,
skill, elaborate machinery and certain rare
and costly metals are necessary to turn out
machine guns. Every German retreat is pro
tected by thousands upon thousands of
these weapons. The allies have captured
at least 25,000 German machine guns in
the past three months and destroyed three
times as many more. Soon or late the Ger
man supply of these guns and their ammu
nition and the men to serve them will run
low, and then Good night!
"Let us hop'; and strive for a happy
peace," chorlles the new prime minister for
the unspeakable Turk. It will be a "happy
pe?cc," all right, but not for the Turk.
"We demand the unconditional surren
der of Germany," says the New York Trib
une, "and we prefer to receive it on Ger
man soil."
FOOD ADMINISTRATION
PUTS COTTON HULL
PRICE DOWN LOWER
AFTER HEARING SETS PfiiCE AT
$10 PER TON WHICH WILL AL
LOW FARMERS OR STOCKMEN
TO FEED IT INSTEAD OF HAY,
THINKS ADMINISTRATOR
FLAGSTAFF, Oct. 16 Due to the
action of the federal food administra
tion in Arizona in fixing the price of
cottonseed I tills at $10 this product
is row available at a reasonable price
tor all feeders of livestock.
fThe price fixed at Washington for
hulls was $20 per ton, but after hear
ing the complaints of cattle feeders
bui also the contention of millers at
a meeting hi Id in Phoenix a few days
ago, the food administration deter
mined that $10 was a reasonable price
that the feeder should pay for hulls.
However, should the market ad
vance to such an extent that the
Phoenix millers in excess of this
amount, they must reimburse all from
whom they bought cottonseed to the
exter.t of the advance over $10.
The food administration Is urging
dairymen and stock feeders to lay in
a supply of hulls sufficient to carry
thera through the winter, because con
ditions in regard to this commodity
uii-ht change at any moment and
huHs n:av not be available for use.
It is estimated by George H. Smal
ley, executive secretary of the food
administration, who has given a great
deal of attention to cotton seed mat
ters, that there will ne avai'aole In
the Suit River valley 12.444.000 pounds
of hulls. Thia will be sufficient to
feed 6.322 head of cattle for 100 days.
The value of hulls for feed is equal to
timothy hay. In fattening catlie it is
fed at the rate of about 20 pounds to
2 pounds of cottonseed meal. In ad
dition to the hulls there will bo avail
able in the Salt River valley about
12,500 tons of cottonseed meal. Seed
Is used extensively throughout this
state. Hulls, however, have not beea
used to such an extent because feed
ers have not thoroughly understool
their value. The feeding situation is
such this year that the food adminis
tration is recommJ;uing hulls and is
urging feeders to buy plentifully.
With the price of cottonseed at $31
per ton and that of hull3 at $10, an
excellent feed is provided the Ari
zona feeder and at reasonable rates.
AH cottonseed meal manufactured
this year by Arizona mills has 36
protein value. The Salt River valley
this year has produced 7S.00I) acres
of long staple cotton. The estimated
yield is 40,000 bales of 500 pounds
each, which if marketed at 70 cent3

Tucson: About 250 carpenters,
painters', brick layers, electricians and
plumbers soon will be out of work in
Tucson, owing to enforcement of the
government prohibition of war time
building. A large number of them
are expected to go to Whipple bar
racks, where a call has been issued
for artisans at seventy-five cents an
hour, though some are preparing to
move to points along the Pacific coast,
where employment is offered by the
war industries board.
The state corporation commisison
issued an order authorizing the Ari
zona Extension Railroad company to
sell its bonds in the amount of $141,
000 to the United Verde Mining Exten
sion company.

CONSOLIDATING OFFICES.
The government Is taking step3 to
save expense in the matter of renti
and in all places wherever possible.
The telegraph offices are now being
moved into the same buildings that
are occupied by the postoffice. Charles
Holzer. who was formerly district
commercial manager of the Western
Union Telegraph company, was in
the district a few days ago looking
ever the situation here. On account
of the crowded condition of the Bis
bee office, they will probably not. be
consolidated here, but the office at
Warren will be moved to the post
office building. The office at Doug
las will be moved into the Federal
building.
RECEIVES CHECK.
Eugene Stevens, the electrician, of
Upper Main street, yesterday received
a check of $23.02 that enabled him to
make payment on a Liberty bond and
to contribute to the Red Cross. From
time to time he saved the little pieces
of copper from old and new work,
pieces that were not over four or five
inches long, until he had about 120
pounds. He then shipped them to
Oakland to the Standard Brass & Cast
ing company and in return therefore
received the above check. Mr. Stev
ens has just recovered from an attack
of illness and was as proud of his
check yesterday as was a small boy
with his first pair of red top boots.
DELIVERED BONDS.
County Treasurer Harry Ross just
returned from Kansas City, Mo., where
he delivered the second lot of Cochise
county highway bonds consisting of
$500,000 worth, which was purchased
by banking interests of that city. The
first half of the million was sold to
the Phelps Dodge interests, and the
money for same was turned ovr to
County Treasurer Ross on June 20th,
and he has now in his possession
$961,154.81 to the credit of that fund,
that being the balance on hand last
night. The personal delivery of the
bonds by Treasurer Ross resulted in
a great saving to the county as the
transportation charges ordinarily
would have cost about $1500 to ship
them to the buyers.

WHISKEY WILL

io mmm
Liquor Which Was to Be De
stroyed Today; Will Be
Tcken by Government and
Alcohc! Recovered for U?e
Several hundred case8 of confiscat
ed whissey at the court hou ., Tomb
stone, which was to hnve been de
stroyed in public this morning undo:
the direction cf Sheriff Guy Welch
will be saved instead. Yesteiday aft
ernoon the sheriff received word from
U. S. Marshal Dillon of Phoenix that
the latter had just been notified by
Attorney General Gregory not to de
stroy any of the confiscated liuuor
held by the county authorises in this
state.
Barrels will bo Bent herj hy the
government so that the whiskey now
held by each county can he transfer
red from the bottles into the bairrls.
This operation will be performed in
public. It is estimated that every
county in the state has approximately
a carload of whirkey on hand, so that
altogether a trainload of whiskey can
be shipped from this Ftate. It will
be sent east to be converted into grain
alcohol, now much needed by the go
ernnient. Plenty ot Barrels
In addition to the whiskey now in
Sheriff Welch's hands, worth $70,000
or more, which has been gradually
accumulating during the past year,
there is now in the city jail S00 cases
of whiskey recently seized at Pirtle
ville and valued at $S0.000. This Is
already in the custody of the federal
officials. Not only Justin C. Daspit,
agent at Douglas of the d.i-nartment of
Justice, but Sheriff Welch' have sougti.
to have the government take over the
liquor to use for useful purposes, but
to no effect. Sheriff Welch first ask
ed the medical department to take
the liquor off his hands. This depart
ment declined but the surgeon gen
eral said the ordnance department
might have use for it. Mr. Welch
then tcok up the matter with the ord
nance department, and it was when
he was notified by this department,
also, that it could not take it that
the sheriff ordered the destruction of
the beverage.
Today's order from the attorney
general shows that the government
has at last decided on a method of
saving whiskey for federal use.
No More Men
For Virginia
Y'esterday O. S. French received a
telegram from A. C. Freeman at Phoe
nix, stating that no more men were
to be shipped from Arizona to Vir
ginia and for him to notify the local
community board. The telegram
further stated that he had been or
dered to report at San Antonio.
Mr. Freeman had been in the coun
ty for about two weeks and was joined
by A. B. Rand on Tuesday and they
had intended to make a big shipment
of laborer from the county within the
next few days, but the orders have
been chanced. The local board Is
still in need of men to be shipped to
Prescott for labor on the government
work there and !t is thought that on
account of this that Arizona was cut
off from sending men to Norfolk.
Approximately 20.000 men are need
ed at Norfolk. Each state is sup
posed to furnish its quota and Ari
zona's share was to have been 500.
From Bisbee virtually nobody but la
borers have been sent so far. The
next Fhlpment of men must go from
here October 18. Men engaged in the
mines, smelters, railroads and other
lines of occupation essential to the
wirning of the war are not accepted.
There are nine different govern
ment plants In Norfolk and vicinity
and they employ 2H0.00O men. When
orders go out for additional help the
calls are for 2,000, 4.000 or R.O'iO at a
time. The plants are probably 2rt.OD0
short at the present time.
The local employment office is
also busy recruiting mechanics to
work on the $2,000,000 tuberculosis
hospital which the government i.i
building at frescott.

GADSDEN HOTEL IS
FINED FOR BREAKING
SUGAR USING RULING
BIG HOSTELRY IN DOUGLAS MADE
TO PAY $200 TO RED CROSS
FUND; OTHER STORES AND
RESTAURANTS IN STATE CITED
TO APPEAR FOR TRIAL
FLAGSTAFF, Ariz.. Oct. 16 In a
hearing before County Food Adminis
trator Robert Rae at Douglas, the
Gadsden hotel has been found guilty
cf repeated Violations cf the sujrar
regulations, and in lieu of prosecution
in the United States courts has been
permitted to make a contribution of
$201) to the American Red Cross.
Ths case is one of a number on
which food inspectors have been work
ing for the past week, after M. T.
Grier, chairman of the hotel and res
taurant division, reported that he was
unable to obtain voluntary complaints
with the hotel and restaurant pro
gram. In this as in other instances the in
spectors themselves were served with
two and three teaspoons of suar,
whereas the hotel regulations limit
the consumption to one teaspoon to
each meal served, or two pounds for
each ninety meals served.
In addition to the above penally,
which has been approved by the en
forcement division of the food admin
istration, the Gadsden hotel will be
required to post a sign, for the word
ing of which the following has been
suggested:
'United States Food Administration
License No. 29436. This license per
mitted its guests to have an excess of
the ration prescribed by the food ad
ministration in the distribution of
sugar. While many of our soldiers
in the trenches are going without
sugar, and patriotic men and women
in Douglas have been complying strict
ly with the government's regulations,
the Gadsden hotel, which should ex
emplify all food rules have repeatedly
violated the sugar regulations. In
stead of proceeding against thid"
license it is premitted to pay $200 to
the American Red Cross-."
For a similar violation the Liberty
cafe was permitted to make a donation
of $100 to the Red Cross. Case
against the American cafe and the
Portola cafe are pending.
For violation of the 80-20 substitute
rule the Lowell Cash and the New
State grocery, both of Lowell, have
been cited to appear for a hearing.
At Tucson the Jess Stick cafe, of
w hich Wong Jan is the proprietor, has
been allowed to make a $50 contribu
tion to the Red Cross.
At Yuma the C. O. D. Grocery com
pany has been cited to appear before
A. B. Ming on a charge of selr.ns
sugar in excess of the two-pound al
lowance and of flour without substi
tutes. This is the second complaint,
and it is expected that a severe pen
alty will be imposed.
