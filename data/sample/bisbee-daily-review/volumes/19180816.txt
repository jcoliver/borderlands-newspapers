WASHINGTON, Aug. 15. Four mil
lion American soldiers can defeat
the German army :n the belief of Gen
eral March, chief cf staff, and present
plans of-the war department call for
more than that number under, arms
next summer with some 3,200,000 of
them, or eighty divisions, in France,
by June 30.
These and other important facts
concerning the nation's effort in the
war a3 given to the senate military
committee by General March, Secre
tary Baker and Provost Marshall Gen
eral Crowder, were revealed- today
by Chairman Chamberlain in present
ing to the senate the administration
man power bill extending the draft
ages to include all men between the
ages of 18 and 45 years.
President Wilson is determined to
bring the war to a conclusion by con
centrating all forces on the western
lront, including Italj, Secratary Baker
told them. General March supple
mented this by stating that it was thu
purpose to end the great world strug
gle quickly and decisively. For the
nation not to put forth its maximum
effort at once, the chief of staff de
clared, would be but playing "Ger
many's game." Thirty-one American
divisions, or approximately 1.300.200
men are in France with as many more
in camps in this country as a reservoir.
Secretary Eaker said that the aceelo
rated program of troop movements
oveiseas which iias enabled General
Pershing to organize his first army of
some l,"o0,000 men will be continued
because of the generous action of the
Priti.ih government in supplying ship
ping. To carry out the present por
gram of eighty divisions overseas
by June 30, neary 2.000,000 men
must be sent to France in the
next eleven months.
General March told the commit
tee. Recording to the report to the
senr.te, that he was in favor of
young men for the arm and that
the youths of 18 registered under
the new draft law would be in
France by June 30. He estimated
that some 2.300,000 men qualified
for full military service would be

WASHINGTON, Aug. 15. The
march of events in Russia from
news received today seems to be
rapidly assuming tin proportions
of a rout of the bolsheviki and of
a nature to bring dismay to Ger
many. With allied troops rapidly mov
ing south from Archangel, forces
of British, French, Japanese and
American troops at Vladivostok
and operating to the westward,
and a British force at Baku, the
Czecho-Slovaks have taken new
heart.
Late dispatches today recorded
the awance of the allied troops
from Archangel to Pabereshskaia,
100 miles south, on the road to
Vologda. The bolsheviki are re
treating and were reported com
mitting every known atrocity on
the civilian population which op- -enly
has espoused the cause of
the allies.
Reports, official ami otherwise, from

Rritih steamer Penistone, victim of a
submarine attack loo miles east of
Nantucket Sunday was sunk without
warning. Benjamin Davies. executive
officer of the ship, who arrived here
with other survivors today, reported.
A torpedo hit the vessel amidships,
killing the fourth engineer and injur
ing four firemen. The captain of the j
Penistone, who returned to his sh:p j
just before she went down, in the hope
of obtaining papers, was captures by
the L'-boat and kept a prisoner of

. The commander of the Penistone
was Capt. David Evans and the engi
neer killed by the explosion was C.
A. Vivor Howclls. The fact was
definitely established by naval author
ities, it was stated, that Captain v-
ans still was aboard the U-boat. The
Penistone left New York Friday with
forty men. comprising officers and
crew. Twenty-nine of these were
landed today at Provlncetown. Nine
were brought here, and with Howells
dead body the only man not accounted
for was the commander.
Davics and the eight others brought
here were picked up by a tug early
this morning, so utterly exhausted that
they could not speak clearly or intel

they nveer had seen men in a worse

BY REVIEW LEASED WIRE
NEW YORK. Auk. 15. Lacking
more obvious or convincing reasons,
trade attributed the further contrao
tion of stock dealings today to firmer
money tendencies and growing confus
ion over the war tax situation.
Call money continued to rule at 6
per cent and time funds held at the
same figure on a paucity of offer
ings. Local banks again called loans
to meet the final installment on the
third liberty loan.
Marine preferred ignored the sub
marine menace by advancing an ex
treme of 2 points.
United Slates Steel, Reading, Union
Pacific and some of the usual favor
ite were irregular at best, rails and
industrials as a whole lacking definite
trend.
Sales amounted to 275.000 shares.
Domestic bonds were firm and Lib
erty again changing hands in
round amounts at the year's top quo
tation of 100.0S but internationals
were easier. Total sales, par value
aggregated $5,375,000.
Old United States bonds were un
changed on call.
GRAIN
CHICAGO, Aug. 15 Increased dam
age of crop reports, especially regard
ing Iowa, gave an upward slant today
to the corn market. Prices closed un
settled c off to lc net higher, with
September $1.62 to $1.62 and Oc
tober ri.63 to $1.63,. Oats gained
'Hifilhic to c. The outcome in pro
visions varied from five cents decline
to a raise of seven cents.
Although at first the corn market
easted down, owing to numerous rains,
it soon became apparent that sellers
had grown wary and that crop injury
was assuming proportions which the
trade in general was unprepared for.
T'.ulls had an advantage also in the fact
that receipts were small.
Talk of libera! sales to army camps
put strength into the oats market
Buying on the part of houses vith
stockyard conections made provisions
average highc. Notice was taken too
of the fact that restrictions on the use
of bacon in England have been re
moved.

took the next two, clipping the record
to 2:05 1-4 in the second heat.
The Winoga stock farm stake of
$5000 divided honors with the Matron
stakes and resulted in a popular vic

was won by Un with two heats in
2:05 1-2.

MELBOURNE, Australia, June 21
(Correspondence of The Associated
Press) Lieutenant-General Sir John
Monash who now commands the Aus
tralian Army Corps the Anzacs fight
ing in France is a Jew. He is the
most representative of a number of
Australian Jews who have enlisted.
In him, too. the Australian Army Corps
has an Australian commander. He re
cently succeeded Lieutenant-General
Sir William R. Birdwood, who Is an
English officer and a professional sol
dier. Sir John Monash is a citizen sol
dier.
Fifty-three years old and a resident
of Melbourne, General Monash is a
graduate in law and in civil engineer
ing of the University of Melbourne,
and is a member of n'ie University
Council. He entered Melbourne Uni
versity from the Scotch College here.
He was a brilliant student. When he
had left the institution he took up civil
engineering. He was. always actively
interested in things military, but it
is on record that not long before the
war when he was consulted about a
boy who longed for a cadetship at Dun
troon (the Australian West Point) he
said:
"If the boy has any aptitude with
which he can enrich and widen his
mind don't let him live his life as a
professional soldier through times of
peace. There is nothing so narrow,
nothing more deadening than the walls
of administrative routing, text book
and regulation by which he will be
surrounded. Let Jiim find his great
life interest in whatever he Is fitted
to practice and to study. If the days
of fighting should come he will be all
the more serviceable because he is at
his best in what he is best suited to
accomplish."
When the war broke out Monash
was a colonel of militia in his native
state, Victoria. Also, he was in com
mand of the Australian Intelligence
Corps, composed of citizen officers.
The formation of the three first expedi
tionary brigades found 'him an appli
cant for a command, but others were
given service before he was selectell.
For a short time he filled the office
of Censor-in-chief. Then, a fresh brie
gade being required for Gallipoli, he
obtained the command of it. "Mon
ash Gully" cn the tragic peninsula,
commemorates the fact that he and
his brigade did yeoman service there.
In France, because of his reputation
gained by his organization of the
Third Australian Division, he has been
regarded in many quarters as the
Commonwealth's greatest soldier

The Compensation Bill
(From the Arizona Record) i
It is unfortunate that organized labor in
Arizona, through the influence and by the
manipulation of a few radical leaders, and
misrepresentation by shyster lawyers, has
been placed on record as opposed to the
initiative measure to be submitted to the
voters at the November election and known
as the Workmen's Compensation Law. It
should not be inferred, however, that al!
members of organized labor in the state, or
a majority of them, will accept the dictum
cf the Miami convention. Several of the
members of that convention represent
trades which would not come under the pro
visions of the proposed amendment, while
a larger number of the delegates hold po
litical positions by favor of President
Crcaff, who led the opposition to it.
J. L. Donnelly, prominent in labor cir
cles, and a strong advocate of the proposed
compensation law, speaking on the floor of
the convention against the adoption of the
resolution condemning the measure, said
that he expected the report of the commit
tee against the bill would be concurred in,
and he warned the convention that before
very long organized labor would see that
thi3 action of the convention was a political
frame-up to widen the gulf between capital
and labor in Arizona.
The entire proceedings of the convention
in relation to the compensation amendment
looks very much like a "cut and dried"
affair. The report of the committee recom
mending the adoption of the resolution con
demning the bill bears the semblance of a
pre-arranged plan. Many of the statements
therein are erroneous. The measure is not
unduly long, neither are its provisions com
plicated, as charged. -It is shorter than the
compensation laws of other states and its
language is simple and its provisions are
free from ambiguity.
It is true that it is not compulsory upon
the employer to be bound by the compen
sation provisions of the bill, neither is it
compulsory on the part of the employe,
who is not denied the right to bring suit
in court for damages for injuries sustained,
unless he elects to be bound by the provi
sions of the proposed law.
The list of works or occupations speci
fied as hazardous is divided into twertty
six classes and is very comprehensive.
Workers in occupations not specified in the
proposed amendment as hazardous are not
affected and lose no rights they now enjoy.
The committee report further alleges that
"the burden of proof is upon the workman
claiming compensation" and that "the law
provides that the claimant must also pay
ALL necessary expenses for witnesses, .
fees, etc."
Upon whom should the burden of proof
rest if not on the complainant Would the
employer be expected to furnish the evi
dence to prove his own liability? The
charge that the claimant must pay all the
expenses for witnesses, fees, etc., is mis
leading. It is provided in Section 1 7 (e)
that each witness who shall appear by order
of the beard shall be entitled to receive, if
demanded, for his attendance the same fees
and mileage allowed by law to witnesses
in civil cases in the superior court, which
amount shall be paid by the party at whose
request such witness is subpoenaed, unless
otherwise ordered by the board. The ex
pense would fall upon either the empoye
or the employer, whichever requested that
the witness be called.
O her objections urged against the pro
posed amendment are equally misleading
or puerile.
Some of the meritorious features of the
measure, as briefly stated by the Arizona
Mining Journal, are:
It replaces the present inadequate com
pensation law.
It provides insurance to the employer and
a guarantee of fair compensation to the in
jured workman.

The injured person entitled to compen
sation will receive it direct from the Indus
trial Accident board of the state, promptly
and without the assistance of the lawyers.
It contains no catchete, come-backs or
jokers.
It comprises all that is best, clearest and
j most unequivocal in the Montana, Wiscon
I sin, Washington and New York compen
sation laws.
It protects the widow and orphan no less
than the injured workman, and safeguards
these from the tricks and fees of a certain
class of lawyers, and from the technical
ities of courts.
It provides more liberal payments for in
juries sustained than any other compensa
tion law in the United States.
A TESTIMONIAL TO THE PRESS
(From tlit! Tucson Citizen) ,
The decision of the house ways and
means committee to levy a tax of 1 0 per
cent on the amount paid for leased wires by
newspapers is the best evidence that the
newspapers cannot be reached by excess
profits or war profits taxes. They are net
making any. Not seeing any chance of rev
enue from the fat or that hard-ridden nag,
the press, the way3 and means committee
sought other means to reach its pocket.
It wilt not sour our patriotism to crab a
little about these taxes on the newspapers
because we are much concerned lest the
government should lessen their capacity for
usefulners to it. The press is an unpaid
arm of national defense. Like the Red
Cross it does its work without cost to the
government, but unlike the Red Cross the
press is not the recipient cf charitable sub
scription. The work of the newspaper arm
is that of popularizing the methods of the
government, which, in effect, 13 populariz
ing the war, since unpopular methods vill
quickly make a war unpopular. The
methods of the government, such as the
draft and the bonds are eminently equit
able, but it needs something more than an
executive order, or even one of Mr. Wil
son's earnest addresses, to bring the vast
public to a cheerful mood of acceptance. In
this task the newspapers have been the pa
tient skillful, loyal servitor of the govern
ment. If excess profits were spoken of to the
average newspaper publisher, he would ask
"What do you mean excess profits? I
haven't reen anj- plain profits yet." As for
war profits, the war butters no 'bread for
the newspapers. It is graceful in Secretary
Baker to concede that news gathering is an
indispensable industry, in view of the indis
pensable nature cf it to the government.
He had in mind particularly domestic news
gathering the gathering of local news for
each paper. But the gathering and editing
of battle news is also indispensable. How
else would the government secure full pop
ularity advantage of the victories won by
American troops? Yet the reporting of
wars increases the expense of newsgather
ing, even when it is done by press associa
tions. No revenue has flowed to the press
from government advertising because there
"ain't no such animal."
The proposed leased wire tax is not the
first war tax levied on the press. It i3 sub
ject to telephone and telegraph taxes, and
to freight increase on paper. This freight
now amounts to a dollar a hundred pounds,
and makes paper cost $5.25 per hundred at
the press as compared with $3.85 a year ago
and $2.70 two years ago. The paper rolls
are packed in heavy wrappers and thick end
boards. They contain iron or wood cores,
all of which is wastage to the publisher, but
pays freight charges.
The subscription prices of eastern news
papers delivered in this section are now al
most prohibitive due to zone postal rates.'
The Citizen subscribed to the Boston Trans
cript at $1 8.00 a year, the New York Times
at $19 a year, the Chicago Tribune at $12
a year. The zone law doubles up on the
cost of The Citizen to eastern subscribers
of whom it has quite a number. Although
the paper is delivered in Tucson for 60
cents a month, the charge would have to be
$1.25 in New York City, in order to break
even, and the difference would be due to
the zone postal law.
Profiteers may worry about the war prof
its, but the press is bh. the and carefree in
this respect. Taxes on profits will not phase
it and some papers will not have the grati
cation of paying even an income tax.

GREAT MORAL DRAMA
AMERICA STANDS BACK
OF WAR SAVINGS
CAMPAIGN
AMOUNT TAKEN IN FOR W. S. S.
AND THRIFT STAMPS DURING
JULY WOULD ARGUE THAT EV
ERY MAN, WOMAN AND CHILD
HAD PAID IN TWO DOLLARS
Imagine, if you can. every man. wo
man and child in the 1'ni'ou States
handing I'iicle Sam during July a t .vo
dollar bill as an investment of per
sonal savings and as a loan to the gov
ernment in support of the war. T'na:.
speaking broadly, is one way of visu
alizing the actual results of the war
savings campaign for the month of
July when the cash receipts i.i the
treasury department from the sa'.e of
war savings aim r:iriu Manses mii
passed all previous records and to
taled (for the month onlv) 5211.417.
942. CI.
Of course, not every man. woman
or child in this country is as yet o war
saver, but the national war savings
W-ommittee authorizes the conservative
j estimate that approximately C4.4'UMi hi
Americans have acquired partnership
with Uncle Sam through the owner
ship of war savings and thrift stamps.
'rge uiajonty or ms army 01 w ar
sclves to save and economize in sup
port of the war, and to invest in war
savings stamps a definite amount of
such savings during the remainder or
1918. If you are not a pledged war
saver, remember that there are ap
proximately one and one-quarter mil
lion reasons "over there" why you
should enlist in this great army over
here.
Some of the statistics recently
released by the national war savings
committee shaw In a most illuminating
manner the magnitude and the splen
did success of the war savings cam
paign to date. For instance, war
saving and thrift stamps are on saje
at over 275.000 authorized salts agen
cies in this country; while on July .'!! 1
theie were 116,43 war savin,; socie
ties registered at Washington heai-
quarfrs. Also, up to and including
JuI'. " V"e department has
In a few words, these treasury re
ceipts mean three things:
1. An investment by over a third
cf the country's population and thrift
at this time is a uatriotic achieve-1
nient.
2. A loan to the government in sup
port of the war.
3. A lessening of competition w ith
the government lor m;:n power and for
raw material.
The war savings campaign has in
the few mojiths of its duration made a
long stride toward educating the
American public to the war necessity
of thrift, of lessening the normal con
sumption of the things the government
needs to prosecute the war, and it has
offered to millions of patriotic Amer
icans a means and an opportunity for
translating their savings into aid to
the fighting men in France.
In England they have called the war
savings committee the war winning I
committee.
