As Mayor of the city of Bisbee, I must insist that

Proposed Increase In Freight
Rates Postponed Until Oct. 15
By U. S. CommerceCommission
(By Review Leased Wire.)
WASHINGTON, June 29.
The interstate commerce
commission today denied
the railroads of the Unit
ed States for a horizontal increase
of 15 per cent in freight rates.
In its decision the commission
indicated its willingness to in
crease class rates in the eastern
district approximately fourteen
per cent. Since about one-fourth
of the freight handled is moved
under class rates, the decision
virtually allows the eastern lines
about four per cent increase in
gross freight revenue. Increases
sought in rat ps on coal, coke and
iron ore will be granted.
The commission found as a re
sult of extended hearings, that the
carriers generally show a sub
stantial and increasing financial
prosperity and that they have
ample resources with which to
conduct transportation.
ARGUMENTS OF RAILROADS

commission holding that the car

zation of troops.
The commission suspended the
proposed tariffs until Octoter 28,
but it indicated that no rehearing
of the case will te of value at this
time and suggested cancellation of
the tariffs.
The commission finds that the
gloomy forecasts of jeopard iied
incomes seen by railroad officials
early in 1917 have not been borne
out by the figures available for
later months. The proceedings
were brought in March, when the
returns from February were just
being made. February was one
of the worst months in railroad
history. The subsequent months
have shown increasing revenues,
while expenses have, in many
cases, foiled to mount to the ex
tent the carriers' offic!als feared.

Manufacture of Beer
And Wines Would Be
A llowed During War
(By Review Leased Wire.)
WASHINGTON, June 29. Intervention of President Wil
son today checked the "bone-dry" national prohibition
movement in congress. Confinement of prohibition
legislation to distilled beverages without interference with
manufacture of beer and wines, it is generally agreed, will re
sult. Prohibition leaders were asked by the president to drop
their fight against the manufacture of beer, wines and other
light intoxicants. With a formal response from the "drys" de
ferred, senate leaders of all factions quickly reached an under
standing to limit absolute prohibition to distilled spirits.
President Wilson exchanged letters with the Rev. Dr.
James Cannon, chairman of the National Anti-Saloon Leagues
legislative committee, and called senate leaders to the white
house in his effort to smooth the way for final enactment of
the food measure. "Bone-dry" legislation was written into
the bill before it passed the house and the senate agriculture
committee amended the provision to prohibit the manufacture
of distilled spirits but empowered the president to permit the
making of beer and wines.
Wilson Regards Bill
In his letter to Dr. Cannon, the
president said Senator Martin, Demo
cratic leader, had asked him to ex
press his views on the food-liquor leg
islation regarding "the wisest and
most patriotic policy to be pursued,"
and added:
"I regard the immediate passage of
the bill as 'of vital consequence to the
safety and defense of the nation. Time
is the essence, and yet it has become
evident that heated and protracted de
bate will delay the passage of the bill
indefinitely if the provisions affecting
the manufacture of beer and wines are
retained and insisted upon. In these
circumstances I have not hesitated to
say to members of the senate who
have been kind enough to consult me
that it would undoubtedly be in the
public interest in this very critical mat
ter if the friends of those provisions
should consent to their elimination
from the present measure. Feeling
that your committee is actuated by the
same patriotic motives which inspire
me, I am confident that these consid
erations will seem to you. as they
seem to me, t'j be imperative."
Answer Deferred.
Anti-saloon league leaders adopted
the following resolution today:
"While recognizing any appeal from
the president and the commander-in-chief
of the army and navy in time of
war, a definite answer would be de
ferred until after conference with pro
hibition leaders in the senate and
house.
Informal agreement, h'owever, was
reached by the prohibition forces in

THAN NOW. SAYS LLOYD-GEORGE
(By Review Leased Wire).
CLASGOW. June 29. David Lloyd
George, the prime minister, delivered
a stirring and characteristic speech
before the burgess of the northern me
tropolis on the occasion of his being
made a free man of the city in the
St. Andrew's hall today,
z The premier declared that if peace
came an hour before the objects for
which Great Britain entered the war,
, had been achieved it would be a ca
; lamity for Europe. Germany, the
prime mlsinster said, wanted peace,
i but a peace which would make the
countries she invaded subject nations.
Mr. Lloyd-George pointed out that
no German statesman bad promised
the restoration of Belgium, and said
that the entente allies could enter into
a conference with a democratized
Gerninny In a different spirit than
they could deal with the Prussian
autocracy.
Unfriendly Demonstration.
Great Britain, said Mr. Lloyd-Gcorge
could hold out if Germany's subma
rine war was kept in bounds and the
people practiced frugality.
The public enthusiasm was temper
ed by an unfriendly demon'ration,

the fight to include beer and wines in j
the liquor legislation. Their future
efforts probably will be directed to se- j
curing an amendment authorizing the
president to suspend manufacture of
malt, fer.nented and vinous beverages j
In his discretion. President Wilson '
told senators with whom he conferred '
today that as a compromise and to se
cure action upon the food control leg- j
islation he would be willing to have '
congress clothe him with such author-1
ity.
Tonight the so-called "dry" leaders ;
in congress conferred and it was ex- j
pected that there would be evolved a
definite plan of action. The prohlbi-
tion leaders admitted that the presi
dent's action eliminated beer and
wines from the program.
Early Passage Expected.
Passage of the food measure early i
next week was confidently expected !
through the prospective elimination of
the great contention 'over liquor. !
Discussion of committee amend- j
ments was begun late today and with-
out a roll call the senate rejected an
amendment by Senator Smith, of Ari- j
zona, to add news print paper and its ,
products to articles over which gov- j
emment control is proposed. j
The senate added fertilizer ingredi
ents t'o the list of products over which
federal power shall extend. Senator
King gave notice of a motion to strike ;
copper from the list, while other sen- i
ators proposed amendments extending :
control to cotton, clothing, leather i
and many other materials.

Pershing's Report On Arrival of American Troops In France
Is Still Lacking; Marine Corps Officials Anxious To
Learn If That Branch of Service Was First To Land In
Keeping With The Traditions of The Organization; Lack
of Supplies May Hinder Training of Guards.
(By Review Leased Wire.)
WASHINGTON, June 29. Reports from Major General
Pershing on the landing of American troops in France
still were lacking tonight and the personal accounts of
newspaper correspondents of the scenes at the French port
again were held up to wait on the official information and army
officials maintained complete silence as to the expedition.
Marine corps officers were eager to learn whether the
regiment of sea soldiers under Colonel Doyen, which formed
part of the initial force, was first to land. The marines gener
ally are proud cf their record cf being first in the field and are
hopeful that it has been sustained in the first despatch of Amer
ican forces to fight in the eld world.
Preparation of the great forces that are to support those
already despatched are moving steadily ahead both in the
army and navy. Announcement today that when the na
tional guard is drafted into federal service and mobilized it will
be sent at once to the divisional training camp sites in the
southeastern, southern and western department was another
step on the road. It will eliminate ecme delay in making
ready the state troops for the front.

Additional training for numerous

progress also at the various officers
traning camps. At least a battalion
cf field artillery has been ordered to
tech camp in order that the artillery
officers of the officers' trainnig camps
for the national army may have the
means of learning the things they
must later teach the new forces.
The greatest problem that faces the
war department is to find supplies for
the steadily increasing host of nation
al guardsmen which moves to its mob
ilization camps some time in July or
August.
Equipment Lacking.
State officials have been notified that
it is impossible to fill requisitions for
new equipment that have been pour
ing in. The first force to be made
ready must be the regular army, ex
panded to 300,000. The officers' train
ing camps, where 50,000 men are un
der arms, also have absorbed an enor
mous quantity of reserve equipment.
The government, it was learned to
day, already is taking steps to look
after the comfort of the troops in
France in addition to regular prepara
tions. The state department has ask
ed that the French duty on tobacco be
remitted for supplies sent to the
American forces there.
The high French duties, if impress

prohibitive.

list of sinkings announced from Lon
don, Wednesday night.
The Ultonia and Manistee, it was
said, were bound with cargoes of
grain and other food supplies from
New York to English ports and the
Buffalo was returning from Hull for
New York. The Haverford has been
engaged in the Philadelphia-Liverpool
service but there was no Information
at hand tonight to show where she
was bound when torpedoed.
VICTORY NEVER MORE
CERTAIN SAYS PREMIER
(Continued From Page One)
all the allied forces had been ready to
bring all-round pressure to bear.
"The Russian revolution, beneficient
as it undoubtedly is. great as will be
its results both this year and even
more hereafter, undoubtedly has had
the effect of postponing complete vic
tory. "Russia," the premier proceeded,
"was now free and unfettered and
when her distractions passed away,
would be more powerful and more
formidable than ever. Meanwhile,
France, Italy and Great Britain had to
bear a greater share of the burden.
Russia Is Gaining.
"The strength of Great Britain once
more flung into the breach, has once
more saved Europe and human liberty.
"But .now Russia Is gaining
strength every day. It is capable.
there has never been a better one. and
her freedom in the future will be in
spired by freedom.
"America, always the mainstay of
freedom, is beginning to 'send her val
iant sons to the battle field to rally
around the cause of humanity. Vic
tory is now more certain than ever.
"Our shipping losses during May
and June were heavy but there were
hundreds of thousands of tons beneath
the admiralty forecast.
"I have no hesitation in saying that
if we do our part the German sub
marines will be almost as great a fail
ure as the German Zeppelins. We
are beginning to get them.
; 'It we do not waste, we will not
starve. We have succeeded in increas
ing the food supply and are engaged
In a great shipbuilding program for
fighting and for carrying purposes.
"If every employer and every work
man will pull together, between them
they will pull us through.
Appeals To People.
"Europe is again drenched with the
blood of its bravest and its best, but
do not forget the great success of hal
lowed causes. They are the Stations
of the Cross on the road to emanci
pation of mankind.
"I again appeal to the people of this
country and beyond that they should
continue to fight for the greater goal
of International rights and internation
al justice so that never again shall
brute force to sit on the throne of jus
tice nor barbarous strength wield the
sceptre over the world."
PROTECTIVE LEAGUE
FORMED IN DOUGLAS
Citizens And Business Men
Take Steps To Block I. W.
W. Menace; Action of Bis
bee League Is Commended.
DOUGLAS, June 29. Following the
lead of the citizens of Bisbee, the
business men of Douglas, this evening,
with two hundred and nine men in at
tendance at the meeting, organized the
Citizen's Protective League of Doug-
las and effected a permanent organiza
tion with Albert Stacy as chairman
and Oscar K. Goll as secretary.
The preamble of the declarations of
the Douglas organization Fays:
"The object of the Citizens' Protec
tive League of Douglas is: to promote
the welfare of the city of Douglas, its
enterprises and industries; to prevent
by all honorable means, any unwar
ranted interference with the orderly
progress and maintenance of Buch in
dustries; to promote the best possible
conditions for the business men, the
professional man and Miose who de
pend upon their daily wage for the
support of themselves and their fam
ilies" Bisbee's Protective League was

command and was capped to shout at
every signal from the front, and its
composition was bo largely foreign and
so plainly dominated by the few hun
dred imported I. W. W. strikers who
have provided the backbone of the en
tire movement, that it provided abso
lute demonstration of the weakening
which the I. W. W. leaders admit
among themselves, but deny to those
of whom they are making dupes. The
leaders have had no h'ope of winning
since Wednesday. Among themselves
they assert that they have accom
plished all they were instructed to do,
this being the stirring up of trouble
and the decreasing of efficiency.
Fifty More Deputies.
The Protective association was
given 50 deputy sheriffs from among
its members by the sheriff yesterday,
who thus raised his force of deputies
to over 300. The council made provi
sion for 40 extra policemen whenever
Marshal Allison should indicate their
need. He has had a reserve list tf
more than that many men ready ever
since war exigencies came in prospect,
months ago. These steps insure that
there Is going to be no lack of protec
tion for all of the men who go to work
or for their homes, which t'ome under
the particular care of the Protective
association and which will answer
calls to any quarter. Of the men,
there will be many more go to work
today, and still more tomorrow, when
the mines will operate in order to give
Wednesday off.
The abundance of deputies yester
day resulted In freedom of company
property and trails from pickets, and
of absence of intimidation methods on
the part of pickets at the public cross
ings, where they assemble.
More Like Holiday.
The day bore ni'ore the aspect of a
holiday occasion than of anything else.
Crowds filled the streets. They in
cluded shoppers, sightseeing folks,
business men, workingmen and pick
ets. Where the latter were thickest
were flanking crowds of citizens who
applauded the workers as they came
from shift or went to work, while the
pickets cheered derisively. The man
sticking withthe job thus got a dou
ble tribute to his sterling qualities of
loyalty. These men carried them
selves with an air of determination,
too, that' was worthy of applause. ,
No conflicts were reported in the aft
ernoon or evening. In the morning a
Mexican was arrested on complaint 'J?
pickets, who alleged that he had
drawn a gun. The man admitted that
he did so, thinking that be was to be
assaulted. A deputy who drew his
gun when a Wobbly picked up a rock
to throw at a miner- he had stopped,
was held on complaint of the strikers.
The deputy also asserted self-defense.
Red Cross Attacked.
Aside from these Incidents, there
was not a ripple during the day.
A period of false rep'orts was indi
cated as probably opening during the
day. A particularly malicious one.
w-hich became current in the after
noon and which will find deep resent
ment; among all patriotic citizens, was
that the Red Cross organization war
issuing buckets to the mines for
their employes, using contributed
funds. No report could have been
nrtre false or despicable. It was so
plainly false that no one considered it
as anything else. Another current lie
was that Sheriff 'Wheeler deemed the
situation so threatening that he had
sent to El Paso for federal troops. On
the contrary, Sherifr Wheeler feels
that the situation is well in hand and
that the force which he has sworn in.
and additional men who are quickly
available for swearing In, should emer
gency arise, will be abundantly equal
to any service that may be required in
the district under the wildest "of re
mote possibilities.
Urges Conciliator.
PHOENIX, June 29. Governor
Campbell tonight recommended to the
department of labor the appointment
of a conciliator to endeavor to securc

To the war department the governor

Thomas P. Glenn resigned his office
as alderman from the Fourth city
ward under the most sensational cir
cumstances in the history of Douglas,
at a special meeting of the city coun
cil Thursday night. C. A. Housel, de
puty collector of customs, was elected
to fill the vacancy.
Toward the end of the special meet
ing of the council. Alderman O. E.
Jones said he had been handed a let
ter with the request thai it be read at
the meeting. It was handed City Audi
tor Spader and read. It said:
Here Is The Letter.
Douglas, Ariz., June 28, 1917.
To the Mayor and Common
Council:
Gentlemen: Owing to the fact
that the mayor has taken advant
age of my absence to manufacture
evidence against me in order to
cover his own misdeeds, I think
it best to sever my connections
with this body and hereby tender
my resignation as alderman of the
Fourth ward in the city of Doug
las, to become effective at once.
Yours truly.
THOMAS P. GLENN.
Mayor Is Aroused.
Mayor Adamson waited until after a
motion had been made and seconded
that the resignation be accepted, and
carried. Then rising to his feet, his
face white with passion, he said:
"If Mr. Glenn says I have manufac
tured any evidence against him or any
other man, I say it is a dirty lie. I
saved the dirty enr's character by not
bringing up matters that have come
to my knowledge. ,
"But I am not through with him. I
have knowledge of his actions that I
can prove and they are sufficient to
send him to prison.
Wants Words Repeated.
"If he had been half a man he
would have been here in person instead
of sending letters. I wish he were
here for I would take pleasure in tell
ing him personally what I am saying
to you. I want this to be public now.
"If he has any friends here I hope
they will repeat to" him exactly what
I have said. If he has any friends who
feel called upon to take the matter
up for him, I am ready."
Alderman Jones said the mayor ap
peared to be addressing his remarks
to htm.
"You brought the letter up and I
considered you his friends," the mayor
retorted. "Please tell him what I
said."
Housel Is Chosen.
Jones said he wished to assure the
j mayor and council he did not know
i what was in the letter.
' J;nes then attempted to move that
I C. A. Housel be chosen to fill the va-
"ancy created by the resignation of
Air. Glenn. The mayor overruled him
? point of order, as another letter
remained to be read.
Following the reading of the letter.
Jones renewed his motion. Boyd sec
ended, and, on the motion being put.
carried unanimously. Mr. Housel, who
was in the audience, was sworn in at
once by City Clerk Fred Lindner, and
took his seat.
"I hope you will fill your position
more creditably than your predecessor
did," said the mayor as he shook
hands with the new alderman. The
other alderman and Acting City At
torney Harry Pickett shook hands
with Mr. Housel, amid the applause
of a large section of the audience.
The French and Germans are engag
ed in intensive fighting in the region
of Corny anil Corbeny in the Soissons
Jlheiins sector, and around Hill 304
and in the Avocourt wood near Ver
dun, while the British are continuing
their operations having the envelop
ment of Lens as their objective.
The battle around Cerny has been
sanguinary, positions several times
changing hands but at last reports
were in the hands of the Germans,
who after several unsuccessful at
tempts won from the French their old
positions at the cost of heavy losses.
In the Corbeny the Germans along
the Laon-Rbeims road also endeavor
ed to force the French line but were
repulsed with heavy losses.
Field Marshal Haig's forces in an
offensive in the region of Oppy have
taken German positions on a front of
2.000 yards and have forced their way
into the town of Avion, two ruiles
south of Lens. In addition successful
trench raiding operations were car
ried out north of Cherisy and south
east of Loos. In the fighting around
Oppy and south of the Souchez river
247 prisoners and 12 machine guns
were captured by the British.
Minor operations continue on the
Russian. Austro-Italian and Macedon
ian fronts. Along the Persian-Meso
potamian front the Turks have forced
the Russians to recross the Abis Hir
man river south of Banch.
Greece has severed diplomatic rela
tions with Germany and her allies and
apparently soon will take the field on
the side of the entente allies. The
new premier E. Venizelos, in taking
the oath of office, announced that
Greece's place was beside democracy.
The British premier in a notable
speech at Glasgow reasserted that it
was the intention of Great Britain and
her allies to continue the war until the
objects for which they had entered it
were realized. Thei end of the war be
fore that time, he said, would be a ca
lamity for Europe. During his address
the premier made the significant
statement that the entente could enter
into conferences with a democratized
Germany in a different spirit than they
they could call with the Prussian autocracy.

The railroads of Arizona will pay
taxes this year on a valuation of $96,-
782,523, according to a comparative
statement of valuation of railroads
made public yesterday by the Arizona
tax commission. This is $4,745,901 in
excess of the valuation fixed last year.
Of t!iis valuation the Southern Pa
cific and the Santa Fe railroad, of
course, represent by far the largest
' amount, in fact more than one-half
of the total. The valuation of the
! Southern Pacific this year is fixed at
1 $2(1.717.200, while that of tiie Santa
Fe is $26,256,840. This is at the rate
of $6S,000 a mile for 392.9 miles of the
former, and the same valuation per
: miles for 36.13 miles of the latter.
The California Arizona & Santa Fe
railroad brances add 394.07 miles val
i ued at $9,840,985.
! Arizona's shortest railroad is the
Miami-Live Oak branch, which is 2.15
miles in length. It is valued at $17,000
: per mile. The Arizoan Commercial
t Mining railroad, with 3.03 miles of
i road Is valued at only $7,500 per mile.
The valuation of the Arizona East
: ern, as returned this year by the tax
commission, is $9,850.S20 on 291.26
miles of track. This is an excess of
I the valuation of last year of $546,620.
First Attempt To Bring About
Settlement of Butte Diffi
culties Is Failure; Future
Meetings Planned.
(By Review Leased Wire)
BUTTE, Mont, June 29. The first
effort to bring the electricians, who
are striking for higher wages and rec
ognition of the Metal Mine Workers'
union, into a conference with the Mon
tna Power company, failed today when
the electricians refused to meet the
company officials. It is expected that
the conference will be arranged later.
The electricians, it was stated by a
member of the union, did not go into
the conference because the instruc
tions received from the Metal Trades
council did not agree with those re
ceived from their own uni'on. The
Metal Trades council is composed of
the electricians and the machinists,
boilermakers and blacksmiths, who
have declared sympathetic strikes. j
The Metal Trades council, acting
under the advice Of organizers of In-!
ternational unions, has insisted that
the electricians go into conference
without demanding the recognition of
the Metal Mine Workers' union, which
as yet has no affiliation with the '
American Federation of Labor. The
electricians, according to a member of '
the grievance committee, refused to 1
withdraw their indorsement of the .
miners. !
About 10 per cent of the miners are
at work in the Butte district It was
stated officially that the mining com
panies are using miners as tool sharp-1
eners since the blacksmiths struck and
that with the limited force of men
underground the mines will be able i
to get a sufficient number of drills
to keep all the miners who want to ;
work busy for a number of days. 1

NEW YORK. June 23. Further uti
settlement in speculative conditions
characterized the first half of today's
till and professional trading, with
sharp and very substan'ial rallies be
fore the close. Motor shares, utilities,
and many minor specialties repre
sented the chief elements of weakness,
and rails gave "way moderately.
M'ich of the belMed recovery result
ed from short covering. United States
Steel made an extreme advance of 2 V:
points from its minimum of 128 and
closed virtually at the top with a net
cain of a point.
Independent steels and related
shares rebounded from their early re
versals of 2 to 3 points with pronounc
ed strength in Crucible and Lackawan

Coppers, shippings and the more vo

CHICAGO, June 29. Both sellers
and buyers held off in the wheat trade
: today pending congressional action on
i
the food bill. Prices kept within nar
j row limits and closed at exactly the
same as yesterday's finish, July at
12.01 and September 1.814. The out
jcome in com ranged from 2 cents de
cline to '4 advance, and oats lost a
shade to 4.
Provisions suffered losses of 17 to
25 cents net .
At first wheat showed a leaning to
the bear side of the market, but
hardening of values took place in the
last half of the session, apparently as
a result to some extent of gossip that
new domestic wheat was not moving
as freely yet as had been expected.
Export activity put strength into the
July delivery of corn but distant op
tions were heavy owing to optimistic
crop reports. Oats were steady in
i consequence of the favorable crop out
look.
Provisions lacked an aggressive
spirit. Lower quotations on hogs dis
couraged buyers and so too did the
fact that cash demand was sluggish.

LEADV1LLE SITUATION
IS STILL UNCHANGED
(By Review Leased Wire.)
LEADVILLE. Colo.. June 29. There
has been no change in the local situ
ation since the mine operators of the
district issued a statement declining
to recoenize or have any dealings with
the local branch of the Mine. Mill and
Smeltermen's union. The officers of
the union addressed a letter to the
mine operators demanding an mcreasr
of $1 a day in the scale. Unless an
acceptance was posted at the mines
by June 28 it was strongly intimated
that the union would call a strike, but
at the union meeting held Thursday-
night no attempt was made to bring
tne question to a vote. Another meet
ing is to be held next Tuesday. Union
officials decline to make any state
ment, and it is believed here that the
necessary two-thirds majority for the
calling of a strike has not been secured.

THE DUTY OF ALL GOOD CITIZENS.
In the old days of the colonies when any danger
threatened a village, whether Indian uprising or rebellion
from within or famine or pestilence, all good citizens
rallied to the refense of their homes. The strong men
manned the walls, the women loaded the muskets and
the children carried powder. Those who shirked or
preached sedition or showed the white feather were
either placed in irons or executed out of hand.
Nowadays we do not turn so promptly to weapon and
fortress walls when trouble hangs over us like a storm
cloud. These are not days of violence such as fathers
knew. But nevertheless all good citizens stand bravely
together shoulder to shoulder for the best interests of
their community. No good citizen can afford to leave his
town when there is work for him to do. He should stay
and play his part. His voice and his influence are need
ed. When those who would injure his town and paralyze
its industries come in from the outside, and the good
citizen goes away to wait until the storm blows over,
then that town is ripe for its fall.
This is not a union fight that threatens, it is a fight
for or against Bisbee and Bisbee's best interests as a
law abiding, progressive and patriotic town. "Stay and
face the music," called out old Gen. Putnam of revolu
tionary fame to his minute men, and that is a good slogan
for all citizens of Bisbee who have their town's best
interest at heart right now. This town may well say,
"those who are not for me are against me."
What would be the result, Mr. Good Citizen, If all of
you go away to wait 'till the trouble blows over, and all
who wish your town ill come hurrying here like vultures
to a feast? Why, the trouble will blow over but it will
blow your town away as it goes.
Now is the time to stay. Now is the time you are
needed most And there is a still higher call for you to
do your duty than the call of town pride, and that is the
call of patriotism. Your country as well as your town
is calling. Calling for copper with which to make war
upon her enemies. Calling for loyalty and staunchness
and unselfishness. The men who place ther country,
their state and their home town and its good name above
every other consideration, petty or otherwise, are in
the great majority here and it is their duty to live up to
their convictions.
CONCERNING UNIONISM.
In the case of the present strike of copper miners in
the Warren district it la not a - proposition of being a
union man or a non-union man; rather it is a case of
being a patriotic American citizen or of hampering the
government in its prosecution of war against a foreign
foe. The men behind this strike have neither the sup
port or co-operation of the recognized leaders and well
wishers of the organized labor of the country. Neither
vital nor practical questions or differences between capi
tal and labor are involved in this present strike.
On the contrary, capital and labor have struck hands
for the period of the war in order to uphold this govern
nient in its fight for a world-wide democracy. The cop
per companies of this district are under contract to fur
nish copper for the government and the government's
allies. The men behind this strike are deliberately try
ing to hamper the government when they incite unrest
among the copper miners and conspire to close the mines.
And the men who give ear to their fervent, florid, foolish,
meaningless promises and denunciations are the innocent
tools with which they strike at the governmnet.
And what is the result, summed up in the cold, piti
less dawn of final reckoning? The government, we all
love and reverence, is endangered at the most moment
ous crisis in its history; the city in which we live and
in which we take so much pride and which we want to
see grow and become great, it is struck a staggering
blow just at the most promising period of its growth and
the beginning of its greatness; organized labor the coun
try over must bear the stigma of disloyalty in time of
national peril; and Arizona, the youngest sister of all
the states, is slapped and rebuked by the brothers of
her own family who have been warmed and feasted at
her own fireside.
And for what cause? The cause of Germany, not union
labor. And for whom? For a few men who are here to
day and gone tomorrow and in whose track are only
burned embers to designate that trouble and turmoil and
strife have passed this way to undo the work of those
who toil and spin and sow.
Patriotism, not unionism, is the issue in this strike.
It may be clouded in the eyes of a few by words but
the morrow's sun will dispel the mists and all men will
see the naked truth and be ashamed.
I TP
COUNTERFEIT GOODS.
The I. W. W. offerings, in the shape of demands, pro
mises, and propaganda, in the Warren District, resemble
nothing more than the most absurd counterfeiting of
everything that is not spurious. Everything about the
organization, its wiles and Its purposes, is bogus, insin
cere and destructive.
"Wobbly" tactics can be traced for several years,
throughout the country, but particularly in the west.
The I. W. Ws marched into communities, their banners
of promise flying at their head, promising Utopian re
forms. They have left these same communities with a
trail of bloodshed, horror and strife behind them. They
have torn down with their principles. In short their
principles are anarchistic, believing in no government
and in no God.
Unfortunate as it may seem, the people of each com
munity where the L W. W. has been permitted to preach
its seditious doctrines has been fooled by the glitter of
the goods. The acid test has never been applied to their
coins until it is too late. Then the criminal has left the
country and a feeling of revolution smites the people.
But it is too late!
The "Wobbly" is a much misunderstood individual.
Like his goods, be is spurious. His glittering offers 8 re
but the vapid mouthings of an unbalanced mind, or the j
open convictions of a treasonable person. In either casej
the resultant actions are reprehensible and terrible. They j
are destrcutive. ,
i
It is bard to conveive how fair minded people can be
come obsessed with' ideas which are offered on silver
platters, but which are but empty and fulsome promises
of an element which will make any covenant and keep
none. It is hard to conceive how fair-minded, loyal Amer
icans can be hoodwinked. It is harder to conceive how
sensible people, once enlightened on a situation, so de
plorably fraught with serious consequences, can still con
tinue to swallow the "hook, line and sinker" of the
"Wobbly" offering.
Counterfeit is a conservative term to apply to the
"Wobbly" and his works.

OAS RANG! S
ALLIES OF THE KAISER.
(Tucson Citizen.)
There is only one way for the nation to meet the I. W.
W. situation in Arizona and insure a continuance of the
production of copper, so vital to the success of our arms.
The government must take absolute control of the situa
tion, provide for the operation of the mines under it3
protection, mobilize men for the industry, making sure,
of course, that they are receiving a fair compensation
and good working conditions, and, if necessary, detail
troops to protect them and guard the mines and reduc
tion plants.
Arizona is the greatest copper producing state in the
union. In fact, she will be producing more copper tnan
all of the other states combined, in a few years.
The I. W. W. will take delgiht in extending the in
dustrial disturbances to every camp of the state and
paralyze the copper industry. This would mean national
disaster.
The I. W. W. agitators thrive on trouble. There is no
excuse for their existence unless they are fomenting a
strike or some other form of industrial disturbance. They
have been gradually mobilizing their forces in the mining
centers of the state and unless the government deals
with the situation with a strong hand in the very start,
it is apt to get beyond its control. To have a number
of the great copper reduction works in Arizona put out of
commission would not only bring disaster to the United
States but to her allies. It would take many months to
replace them.
The L W. W.'s are among Germany's best allies. They
are performing a real service to the Kaiser. They are
the worst enemies the legitimate unions have. Unless
they are controlled, they will carry industrial and civil
warfare into every section of the state and cut off a large
part of the nation's copper supply.

CITIZENS' PROTECTIVE LEAGUE.
THE PRICE OF TOMATOES.
Last year there was a plentiful tomato crop. Tomatoes
were canned at a cost which, according to federal author
ities enabled the canner to sell them to the Joblier at
around 80 cents a dozen cans. The jobber then sold them
to the wholesaler at 90 cents a dozen. The wholesaler
passed them on to the retailer at $1 a dozen. The retailer
sold them at 11.20 to $1.50 a dozen, or 10 to 12Vs cents
a can.
Nobody has much fault to tind with that procedure.
Some of the middleman profit might have been eliminat
ed, but It wasn't enough to get excited about. However:
Those same tomatoes are now said to be selling at 20
to 25 cents a can. That is, the consumer is paying $2.40
to $3 a dozen for tomatoes that the canner only got so
cents for last fall. The jobbers who paid 80 cents for
them and held them are now charging $1.80 to $2 a dozen
for them. The wholesalers who stocked up with them at
90 cents a dozen are charging $2 to $2.20. The cost of
holding them has been negligible.
It's the old story. The grower got little for his product.
Neither the canner nor the retailer made much profit.
The middlemen got it nearly all. by the simple process
of grabbing the supply and then charging, what they
liked for it. ' 1

NEW TYPE OF GERMAN
SUB IS DESCRIBED TO
U. S. JAGKIES ABROAD
(By Review Leased Wire.)
! BASE OF THE AMERICAN FLO
TILLA IN BRITISH WATERS, June
29. The captain of a torpedoed mer-
: chantman has turned ver to the naval
authorities here a sketch of a new type
of German submarine equipped with a
i wire cutting device designed to re
lease it from nets. The sketch shows
several strands of stout steel hawsers
stretched from the bow to the conning
tower and thence to the stern. At
tached to these is a series of heavy
circular knives, a foot in diameter.
and placed about a yard apart.
The captain made the drawing while
in a small boat after his ship had been
Torpedoed. He had been shelled and
torpedoed in two other ships, but on
neither of those occasions had he no
ticed anything different in the type of
the German diving boats. While he
was n'ot close enough to the last sub
marine to examine minutely the ad
dition to its upper works, he was en
abled to see plainly enough to make a
good sketch. The theory of the cap
tain is that a boat so equipped would
have hope of cutting away from en
tanglements in which it might become
enmeshed.

BACK TAXES DUE.
Bills for all back taxes excepting
those of 1916 will be placed in the
hands of the county attorney for col
lection within two weeks. Within
thirty or sixty days the back taxes for
1916 will be added to the assortment.
County Treasurer Taylor announced
yesterday.
"The costs in each suit will prob
ably run as high as $25 and this
amount will be added to the taxes." he
said, "so that it will be a very expen
sive process to remain delinquent.
Lots, houses, mining property and per
sonal effects where the taxes are not
paid and have become delinquent will
be (Ald by the sheriff for the amount
of the suit and the taxes."
It is said that there is very little
mining machinery upon which the
taxes are delinquent and the mining
property is pretty well taken care of.
