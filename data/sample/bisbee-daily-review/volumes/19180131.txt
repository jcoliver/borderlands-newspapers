stcrms. Reports reaching the railroad
and fuel administration tonight show
ed New England, parts of Pennsylva

were indications that many industries
would be forced to stop operations
for a few days for lack of fuel.
Already the railroad administration

emergency, it was said, and develop
merits ciust depend almost entirely on
weather conditions. Forecasts of these
gave no basis of hope, for snow was
premised for most of the country east
of the Mississippi tomorrow.
No New Order Pianned
No new orders for a general indus
trial shutdown are planned by the
fuel administration, but tlie prefertial
treatment of coal shipments continue.
An extension of the freight embargo
might be considered by the railroad
administration to assist railroads to
move coat it was explained, except
for the fact that very little general
freight Is being accepted for eastward
movement.
Reports to Director General McAdoo
Indicated that the west-bound move;
stent of freight today was nearly 10
per cnt nnder that of yesterday. Most
of this was coal. The return move
ment of empty cars to mining dis
tricts was slightly better, except in
West Virginia, Ken tuck and Virginia,
where floods restricted transportation
seriously.
Weather conditions and railroad
congestion have interfered seriously
with shipbuilding activities, according
to reports today to the shipping
board. Deep snow has made it im
possible for men to work. In addition
the freight congestion has curtailed
the supply of materials to a great
extent, and some shipyards are entire
ly without materials.
The new zone system o distributing
coal will be put into effect next week,
but officials do not believe that it will
effoct much saving of handling at

in the south Atlantic and Gulf states,
and a cold wave preceded by liJ?

tonight by the weather bureau.
The gulf disturbance yesterday

sweeping on to New England tonight,
with snow falling as far north as the

AMSTERDAM. Jan. 30. The Berlin j
correspondent of the Telegraat sends ,
ne lonowing.
"Xot a sign of the strike can be ob-!
served in the Berlin streets. The gen-1
era! impression is that it is a so-called
'holiday' strike, which it is said will
be limited to three days.
The correspondent gained the im-1
pression at a meeting he attended
that the strikers regarded i more as .
a change after heavy work, and it j
bears no violent character. The work-;
ers gather at places where meetings
are convoked, but are directed by the
police into side streets where they are
dispersed."
According to the Vorwaerts the i
movement originated with the work-'
men themselves, but it was resolved '
that both sections of the Social Dem-1
ocrats should co-operate, as it was no ;
time for the issuance of contradictory '
orders. The railway men attempted
to bold a meeting yestemar io consia-;
?r the question ot a strike, but they ;
were dispersed by the police.
Many ;
. arrests were made.

complaints of car scarci'y continued.

complete traffic blockades p.ll the war

the bulls.
Shortage of immediate supplies, to

such that the top of the hill must

it is only a question of time until

MAMMA! DON'T YOU

Look at tongue! Move

. at once.
.Motner: lour cnud isn t naturally i
cross and peevish. See if tongue is
coated; this is a sure sign its little
stomach, liver and bowels need a

When listless, paie. feverish, full of
cold, breath bad, throat sore, ?oesn"t
eat, sleep or act naturally, has stom-jch-ache,
diarrhoea, remember, a gen
tle hver and bowel cleansing should
always be the first treatment given.
Nothing equals "California Syrup of
Figs" for children's ills: give a tea
spoiful, and in a few hours all the
foul waste, sour bile and fermenting
fod which is clogged in the bowels
I passes cut of the system. and you
have a well and playful child again.
All children love this harmless, deli
cious "fruit laxative," and it never
fails to effect a good "inside" cleans
ing. Directions for babies, children
;of all ages and grown ups are plainly
on the bottle.
Keep it bandy in your home. A lit
tle given today saves a sick child to
morrow, but get the genuine. Ask your
druggist for a 50-cent bottle of "Cali
fornia Syrup of Figs," then look and
see that it is made by the "California

I The Governorship j
Books on the gubernatorial race in Arizona are still
open and entries, either lr or prosper tire, warrant a big
field. One thing the voters should never lose sight of
for an instant in selecting nominees is the Imperative need
for a big man for war governor. Petty and partisan and
factional politics have no place this year in these United
States. It is directly ap to the people of this state to
select a man who will measure up to the job. He ought
to know something about business as well as politics
Ke ought to be broad and fair enough to represent a!."
interests in this young and growing state. If the people
go to sleep at the primaries and let the politicians and
professional boosters select their candidates for them,
they ought not to yell "ouch" when the shoe pinches
their pride in their state or their business, as it surely,
will if a little or petty man is named for this important
place. While the governor has no direct and autocratic
power for either much rood or much evil, yet by ap
pointment and influence and example, he has much to
do with the progress or detriment of his state, indus
trially, socially and in the eyes of the west generally.
And as regards the prosecution of the war he is a most
vital factor in the proposition of just how much Arizona
will do.
If that often heralded German offensive in the west
has been gathering head of steam all this time since
the first warning of its near approach came, it will be
a terror. But the fact is, Germany has evidently proved
to be not as strong in mn and munitions and energy as
some of the allied leaders and the allied politicians an?
the special correspondents thought. Her losses las:
year were appalling. Her need of cotton, copper, nickel
and meat fats is pressing like a spear point to her vitals.
It is true that she has at least a half million available
from the eastern front and that she is still strong and
mill doubtless make a strong offensive early next spring.
But that she will be as strong and menacing as certain
alarmists feared a month or so ago, is doubtful. TZte
allies will bave enough men and guns 'to hold their lines,
but as to whether they will fcave enough to break through
the German lines is another matter.
Russian princes, rulers, magnates and statesmen gen
erally for the past twenty years are just as much to
blame for Russia's sad plight today as are the Bolsheviki.
Their weakness, graft, vacillation and cruelty made the
Bolsheviki cataclysm possible. Prince and peasant, they
have dealt only in extremes. There seems to be no
middle class worth white or speaking of in Russia. And
the middle class, as everyone knows, is the salvation of
every country. It is from the middle class that mer
and measures come that curb the rulers and check the
radicals. The middle class must be depended upon to
do the fighting, building and producing; above is the
crust and below is the scum. And, alas, for no one is
perfect, the middle' class contributes largely to both of
these.
What has become of Grand Duke Nicholas Russian
army that beat the Turks so badly in the Caucasus and
took Erzerum? Not a telegraphed line has appeared to
inform the world of the whereabouts and doings of this
great body of men since last October.
There is enough peace talk to end a dozen wars, but
the trouble is, no one has been beaten enough to talk
any kind of peace but a peace with victory. Looks like
at least two mot years of wheatless. meatless days.
The price of butler, eg?s and meat continues to climb
Boy. if you don't page Hoover pretty soon it will be
everlastingly too late.
The Socialist
No doubt both Trotzky and Lenine have reached the
point when they think they are Just as good as a Hohen-zollern.
The Socialists are opposed to war. no matter what
be its cause or aims, and yet the Socialists have profited
more from the Great War than any one else in the world
that this editor can think of at this time. They are
in the limelight and in the centre of the stage. In Rus
sia, France, England, Austria, Germany. Italy and the
United States they have secured more attention and
newspaper space and platform room than they ever had
before or could possibly have had but for the war. It
Is true they appear in a most unfavorable light, most
of them being disloyal to their own country and many
of them nothing less than traitors. They are a constant
worry and even menace to their governments. But never
theless they are in their element as long as they can
attract attention. Their principal strength seems to
depend upon the influence they exercise over the thou;ht
less and restless and aissatisfied and ignorant clssse:.
of workingmen. They preach peace from curbstone and
ed'torial column and bark room rostrum and thus hamper
and harass the governing bodies of their governments,
and at the same time they declare war u?ca all property
owners and business men and recognized authority. They
will fight for their own principles and gain but not for
their country. If the Socialists had their own way in
Europe and America. Japan would have an easy time
conquering the world five years hence. 'Looking about
to find any real good the Socialists are dcing at t h t -time,
one can find only one thing in their favor they
are causing the German kaiser a lot of worry. They
offer nothing for something, and that wont work o;:t.
Doubtless many well meaning and earnest anc unse'Iisa
men are in the Socialist ranks seeking to better the con
dition of tie workingmen, bat, unfortunately the leaders
and more active members of the organization seek only
their own gain and fame, just like other mortals, and
would destroy that industry from which the worker
gains his livelihood.
But thoughtful men are paying more attention to tl
socialist movement than they ever did before. It mry
well have to be reckoned with. Its capacity for harm is
unlimited. Out cf the terror and tangle and torment of
Russia comes the Socialist to represent the torn rem
nants of this once gr?at nation before the wonderinf
world. Out of Austria and even autocratic Germany
come rumblings and mcrmurings of discontent in So
cialist voices. These have but little weight as yet. but
there are possibilities that they will cause thouble. So
cialists speak for a not small per cent of the British ane
French and Italian workingmen. Socialists rant ana
rave in many tongues and under many mottoes, banners
and guises in these United States.
Everywhere they seek to do all the harm they can
do to organized forms of industry, society, government
and business. As to how much they can do depends
upon how far thev are allowed to go unchecked by those
they are eager to destroy. There is not the least danzer
of any permanent plague of these gentry, but, like the
German invasion of Belgium and Northern France, they
would do an immense amount of harm if vested with any
real power, before their theories were exploded and their
glittering castles fell to the ground.
Take the case of Russia. The Socialists are in Tac
ascendancy there today. But if they were thrown out
tomorrow, yet still the harm mill have been dtme. Rus
sia is betrayed and her armies disintegrated" arid her
fortifications destroyed. Peasants are in power end
serteants command the few troops under arms. Looters,
rioters and lean thieves run amuck in city street and
country estate. Defenseless, hopeless and racked by suf
fering, she awaits the coming of her German master.
The Socialist nasses on. either to the prison, the gallows
or other lands, it matters not. His equality debauch har
ended, as all debauches must end. in the cold, inevitable
tight of the morning after.
He tears down, does tne Socialist Tis his only trade.
He is a wrecker. Borne forward upon the black wings
of war, he is an actual menace right now in every Chris
tian land. Dangerous, daring, designing men dominate
his councils and direct his activities. He has a hundred
branches, of which the Bolsheviki is the greatest right
now. and the L W. W. is not the least. Thousands of
printing presses work night and day spreading his
doctrines. What if there be well meaning and mis
directed men among his followers; what matter if he
cannot endure for long in power in this world of progress
and construction. The harm that he will do in his brief
away wiH none the less terrible. Not until the next
generation will the effects pass away.
Whether he is liked or not. or respected, he must he
considered. He is one of the evils that are attendant
in the train or war. His shadow is creeping across the
earth's surface. Thought and attention must be given
to him. The householder must either go forth to meet
j this man of the highways who is at his door and win
him from vagabondage and irresponsibility and anarchy
or he must sternly suppress hm or he must take tn
the storm cellar and remain until this terrible tempe-t
passes.

Fifty citizens met in the high school
auditorium last nicht with the inten
tion of nominating fourteen men. gooc
and true, to draw np a city charter, but
on the recommendation cf Mayor W.
M. Adamson and City Attorney J. P.
Boyle decided to drop the matter.
Unanimously they adopted a resolu
tion submitted by C. T. Francis, ask
ing the council to rescind the acticn
it took in starting work on the propo
sition. The reason for this action was that
the ci'y officials did not think a ne--
city charter ootid be drawn un and
approved by the people before May !.
This would mean that the charter
would not become effective until two
years nence, or until the terms of citv
officials elected in the spring expire.
At any rate it was thought there might
be lertl difficult:" in the way of at
tempting to force city officials out dur
ing their terra of office in order to
put the new form of government in
effect. Such officials might lie abl-
to collect salaries for the unexpired
portion of their terms ty appealing to
the courts.

Their reqest is based on the fact
that thy are losing their cattle. Mex

have charge of the operation of all
ships American, allied and neutral
entering and leaving American ports.
The committee was named by repre
sentatives of the shipping board of
railways.- the British government and
cwners who met to devise some plan
for speeding np the movement of sup
nlies to Europe. It comprises P. A.
S. Franklin of the International Mer
cantile Marine, chairman; H. H. Hay
mond. head of the Clyde and Mallory
lines and recently made shipping con
troller at New York and Sir Cunnop
Guthrey. director of British shipping
in tii is country.
Pool of Ships.
The srrangement. as explained by
shipping board officials, in effect
creates a pool of ships moving sup
rlies to Europe. Goods destined for
overseas will be loaded in available
1 siiSps whether operated by the Cnited
States or the allies. With the aid of
the railroad administration the com
mittee will divert to southern ports
much of the supplies that heretofore
have clcs.eed the port of New York
and incoming Tessels will be directed
by wireless to proceed to the ports
in which materials of the most im-
I porta nee await shipment.
In connection with the action offi
cials attached particular siimificance
to the derision to dispatch abroad
Raymond B. Stevens, vice chairman
of the shipping board and George
Rublee of the board's lexa staff to
sit in London and Paris as permanent
representatives of the I'nited States
in shipping matters.
A decision to give the control com
mittee authority to divert to the vari
ous ports shipments of goods intended
for overseas transportation, officials
said, will accomplish an amalgamation
of rail and water transportation fa
cilities sought since the beginning of
the war.
May Divert Traffic.
As explained tonight by shipping
board officials the diversion of traffic
to ports other than New Cork will
clear New tYork harbor of its present . make successes of their efforts. The
congestion. It was declared that at ' company is at ttie Orpheum for an in
least one million tons of shipping definite stay,
would be gained by a proper co-or-
sination or effcrt.
The railroad administration has
agreed to co-operate in every way to
make th plan a success and will so
route freight as to get it quickly to
southern ports. Charleston and Sa-:
vannah will be the ports through ;
which most of the freieht diverted !
from New York will be moved. All
cotton and other products coming
from the south will go largely throush
these ports and no more will be ship-

THE BIS BEE DAILY REVIEW. THURSDAY MORNING, JANUARY 31, 1918.
SENATOR ROBERTS
THROWS HAT IN THE
RING FOBGOVERNOR
Charlie Roberts, Hunt sup
ports, Twice in. Upper
Branch of Legislature, and
Practically Announces His
Candidacy.
Unheralded, bat with a gubernatori
al boc'ii under his arm. Senator C. M.
Roberts arrived in the city yesterday
momlag from Willcox to spread defi
ance in the ramp of the friends who
are erring Senator Fred Sutter to en
ter the Democratic primary as a can
didate for the nomination for gover
cor. From here Roberts wiil to to
Douglas, anotb-r hotbed of Satter en
thusiasm, and see what he tan do in
splashine cold water. At the latter
u rnj as an all-roand politician with
acquaintance with the varying twists
of the pa me. Roberts, it may be added,
is handy ani efficient.
The visiting senator was Terr busy
here .11 day yesterday, and last night.
He has not a few friends and admirers
ia the district and he was retting in
teach personally with as q;dt as he
could. Nor was he overlooking the
c-ther siJe. Indeed, it tppeared a part
c.f the senator's plan of campaign to
make a clean breast of his candidacy
against each and every and ail condi
tions and circumstances. In other
words, the gentleman is out with an
honest to goodness, unfettered Rob-
errs boom for governor. Those who
j know him understand that this means
; that all the preliminaries have been
i disposed of and that Roberts u in to
I stay to the finish. In fact he has nev
. er been known to start anything that
i he did not stay rieht on the job until

j history. ba?iness. industrial, political.
' ; would have to undergo a sweeping.
I comple-e aJreratio-a and wiping out to
allow tin? to once make a start for
anything and q-ait before the Snish.
Jut why Senator Roberts hastened
to the district immediately it became
noised about that friends of Senator
Salter were- after the latter to enter
the Democratic primary. Roberts did
not say yesterday. Possibly it is
enough that once having made up his
" mind to do a thing it is characteristic
of Rouerts that he wastes no shining
minute. Possibly word came from the
capital beading at Phoenix that there
was no time to lose. As to bis rela
tions at the eapitoL however. Roberts
is coy. It may be that to seme he is
telling more than to others, but to
some it is certain be is averring that
; his relations ith Hunt have never
j been of the bog-tied character that
! many have presumed. Maybe this is
J only for Bisbee consumption, bat it is
Ell
nt
I
only fair to say that there are many j
who have noted the senator's inchna-;
tkn to large and sm-eeptng imiepend-j
ence in private life and found it hard
to figure out that be would jtermit pol
itics to put a collar on hint. However
that may be. there are some local poli
ticians who mill have to be shown be
fore thev wi!l believe that the entry
of Roberts does not mean that the
Hunt backing has been assured him 1
and that loyal service in the past has
am mua 11 lur mm.
It is interesting to note that almost
at the hour of the arrival of Roberts
as a gubernatorial candidate, rumors
inspired in Phoenix press matter be
came current in the papers of the
southern part of the state conveying j
the impression that Colter might not j
after all be the candidate of the Hunt j
faction. A week ago it was given out i
quietly that this little thing was set-j
ti?d in favor of Colter. However, it j
was not possible to trace the Colter re- j
port to a definite source. Apparently :
there was method in the strings to the ;
story.
Another interesting point is that It ;
at the same time should become c-jr-;
rent rumor that Osborn is not in the :
favor f.f the Hunt faction as much as
he used to be. although this will be.
accepted to the bitter end with many ;
grains of salt. Osborn is a politician ,
from the ground up and his alliances j
are here, there or wherever' fancy and !
political acumen may direct that they ;
can be to the best advantage at the j
moment, with a change every other .
moment if expedeincy so suggests,
', All of which leads back to the fact i
: that of the three, and with the Cobb, i
' Jones and other possibilities from the
' Hant famQy thrown in. Roberts is nn-
deniably the type who, would appeal to j
the head of the Hunt machine as the .
favorite. If be can bustle over his j
. home eounry and gather assurances .
that will stand the acid test at head- J
quarters that Cochise will rive him an j
even break, it is very likely that he,
win get the official backing. It is ap-
' parently this business that he is now j
ecrared upon, and be has the advan
tage on his side at the start of know- j
i ing that neither Colter nor Osborn can j
' do in Cochise what be can do. Xor j
has he to deal with fancy in this mat- j
ter. for he has twice been elected to
the legislature, besides having been a ;
member of the Constitutional con v en-.
tion-

the race on friends of Sutter was said !
last night by some of these only to in- i
crease their determination to have ;
him come out. j
