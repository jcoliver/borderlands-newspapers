, . tQ the finaj yote
The section which would authorize
the president to limit, regulate, pro-
fcibit or reduce the supply of food 1
materials or feeds In use in the
making of alcoholic liquors, falls
short of the demands of most of the
anti-liquor elements. A majority
hopes for absolute prohibition of the
use of grain for beverage purposes
during the war. They are not agreed
on any one proposed amendment, how
ever, and their divisions may result
in leaving the provision unchanged.
Except for the prohibition drive,
nothing was in sight tonight to pre
vent passage of the measure in the
house tomorrow and the outlook In the
senate for quick action also was con
sidered good.
Formality of debate proceeded in
the senate with Senator Reed of Mis

noon in opposition to the measure
while other leaders continued informal
conferences looking to compromises.

General Manager of Emer

Ordered By President To
Build All Ships Possible.
(By Review Leased Wire)
WASHINGTON. June 22. The con
test between Chairman Denman of the
shipping board, and Major Genernl ,
Goethals, manager of the board's1
emergency fleet corporation, for au-j
t.hority to exercise powers granted by;
congress In providing a merchant '
j fleet will be settled by President Wil- j
! son giving Ceneral Goethals the an- j
j thority, with directions that he build i
all the ships possible, both steel and :
wooden.
I General Goethals will be authorized i
to commandeer immediately all ship-1
ping upon completion of its construe-j
tion and spend the $500,000,000 ap-
i propriated by congress for shipbuild- f
ing. Chairman Denman will retain
I powers necessary for operating and
chartering ships and as president of
the fleet corporation will continue to!
pass finally on contracts for construc
tion. Asks Investigation.
The power granted to the president
to commandeer ship supplies probably
will not be delegated to any one for
the present
The government, It is
said, hopes to arrive a some arrange
ment as to steel prices which will
make it unnecessary to commandeer.
The dispute over prices to he paid
for steel took a new turn today when
Chairman Denman asked the federal
trade commission to investigate the
cost of steel manufacture with a view
to arriving at a fair price and General
Goethals requested the steel commit
tee of the council of national defense
to take the matter up. Mr. Denman
has balked at paying more than $36
a ton for steel and refused to sign
contracts made by General Goethals
calling for steel at $95.
Explains Action.
Mr. Denman's action in requesting
the trade commission to determine
steel manufacturing costs was ex
plained tonight in a statement saying
the shipping board desired some es
tablished government agency to ar
rive at costs so that the individua'
consumer might be protected against j
a raise in prices which would come ,
when the government went itno the
market for large quantities of steel

MORE THAN THREE
BILLION SUBSCRIBED
(Continued from psge one.)
"More than $2,000,000 up to and in
cluding $6,000,000. each 25 per cent
but not less than $600,000 in any one
instance. Subscriptions in this group
totaled $234,544,400; allotments will
total $58,661,250.
"More than $6,000,000 up to and in
cluding $10,000,000 each, 21 per cent.
Subscriptions in this gi'oup totaled
$466,574,150; allotments will total $90,
801.000. "The paring down process thus will
apply chiefly to the large subscribers.
In cases where larger subscriptions
have been reported to the federal re
serve banks as consisting of a number
of small subscriptions, provision has
been made for allotment in accord
ance with the several amounts of the
smaller subscriptions.
McAdoo Explains.
"The figures as to the number of
subscriptions are estimates," Mr. Mc
Adoo explained, "because the returns
from the federal reserve banks in this
respect are incomplete, but when final
ly reported they will exceed the num
ber stated (4,000,000).
"One of the chief purposes of the
campaign was to distribute the Lib
erty bonds widely throughout the
country and place them, as far as pos
sible, in the hands of the pe'jple. This
was important because the strength of
the government finance, like the
government policies, rests upon the
support of the people. The large num
ber of subscribers .especially the large
number of small subscribers, is most
gratifying and indicates that interest
of the people was aroused as never be
fore In an issue of bonds.
"The widespread distribution of
b'jnds and the great amount of the
over-subscription constitute an elo
quent and conclusive reply to the en
emies of the country who claimed thi,'
the heart of America was not in tins
war. The result of which every citizen
may well be proud reflects the patri
otism and the determination of the
American people to fight for the vindi
cation of outraged American rights,
the speedy restoration of peace and
the establishment of liberty through
out toe world.
Installment Due June 28.
"As originally announced, the pres
ent issue of bonds is limited to $2,
000,000,000 and no allotments will be
made in excess of that amount. I have
consequently decided to exercise the
right reserved in the announcement 'of
fering the bonds to the public, to ailow
in full all applications for the smaller
amounts and to reduce allotments on
applications for the larger amounts.
In view of the great number of sub
scribers for $10,000 and less, allot
ments will be made tfj them in full."
The first installments of 18 per cent
of subscribers, or $360,000,000, is due
next Thursday, June 28, the initial 2
per cent having been forwarded with
subscriptions.

Suffering Described As Torture
Relieved by Black-Draught.
I Rossville, Ga. Mrs. Kate Lee Able, of
j this plaae, writes: ".My husband is an
engineer, and once while lining, ne in
jured himself with a piece of heavy ma
chinery, across the abdomen. He was
so sore he could not bear to press on
himself at all, on chest or abdomen. He
weighed 165 lbs., and fell off until he
weighed 110 lbs., in two weeks.
He became constipated and it looked
like he would die. We had three different
doctors, yet with all their medicine, his
bowels failed to act. He would turn up
a ten-cent bottle of caslor oil, and drink
! it two or three days in succession. .He
did this yet without result. We became
desperate, he suffered so. He was swol-
! len terribly. He told me his sut'fering
could only be described as torture.
I sant and bought Thedford's Black
Draught. I made him take a big dose,
and when it began to act he fainted, he
was in such misery, but he got relief and
began to mend at once. He got well,
and we both feel he owes his life to
! Thedford's Black-Draught."

- San Francisco, 7:20 p. m., June 20th, 1917.
WESTERN COPPER SYNDICATE,
Phoenix, Arizona.
In my opinion Michigan Verde presents one of the most attractive
investments in the Jerome District today. Geological and structural
conditions are distinctly favorable for deep seated ore deposition as
croppings underlying the lime capping show the alteration products of
associated minerals which are known to have accomplished superficial
alteration. It is well known that copper is easily leached from the
surface and precipitated into valuable ore bodies at depth. In this
instance we have evidence of leaching in acidic rocks leaving a fer
ruginous outcrcp or iron stained rock which invariably passes down
ward into commercial copper ores. My inference is justifiable since
the above characteristics are almost universally associated with ex
tensive copper ore deposits at depth. Adjoining the famous United
Verde which has been in operation since the early Eighties and in
close proximity to the great glory hole is an important fact which must
not be overlooked and should in itself commend Michigan Verde as a
meritorious investment Deep development has demonstrated many
theories made by eminent geologists all of which have worked out suc
cessfully in the Jerome district. From an engineering standpoint I
can conscientiously recommend the exploitation and development of
the Michigan Verde and the results I am confident will amply repay
the investor.

GOV. CAMPBELL PAYS
VISIT TO CITY ON
KIS WAY TO PHOENIX
Came To Cochise County To
Confer With Army Officials
At Douglas Over Canton,
ment Site. To Inspect Militia
At Naco.
Governor Thomas E. Campbell was
a visitor to the city last evenmg, com
ing up from Nad), where he had spent
the day inspecting the Arizona militia.
The governor met a number of friends
at the Copper Queen hotel during his
short stay In the city. The governor
made the present trip to Cochise coun
ty for several reasons, according to a
statement made just before he left on
the Golden State limited i'.r Phoenix.
One was to give encouragement to the
southern counties in the present great
drive for the Red Cross; another to
pay a visit to the camp of the First
Arizona infantry at Naco; but the
principal and immediate cause was to
get definite information regarding
what had been done in the matter of
locating an army training camp in the
state Vf Arizona.
"I am very anxious to have at least
one of the training camps located in
this state," said the governor. "When
I saw camps being named by the war
department in various sections of the
country I became anxious about Ari
zona and wired to our congressional
delegation in Washington asking ab'out
the prospects for Arizona receiving a
camp. I was much surprised when I
received a telegram from Senator Ash
urst saying that no recommendations
had reached the war department for
the establishment of a camp in tbis
state. He was also informed that the
secretary of war had expressed a wish
to have a training camp in Arizona, but
in the absence of any recommendation
'of a suitable place had not considered
any place.
"I had heard that General Greene,
after bis visit over the state at the
head of a commission to examine pro
posed sites for an army training
camp, had recommended a site for
such a camp in the state, so I went to
Douglas to see the general and find
out definitely about the matter. Gen
eral Greene told me that his commis
sion recommended t0 places in the
state as meeting the requirements for
a training camp. This report was
mailed to the commander of the south
ern department at ran Antonio on
June 3, from El Paso. I wired this fact
to Senator Ashurst this morning and
I have hopes that one of the training
camps-will be located in the state. Von
will understand that my efforts are
for no particular site, but are being put
forth in the interest of the entire
state."
Governor Campbell is very much
disappointed beeause of the failure to
recruit the First Arizona infantry to
war strength. He said the regiment
now has a strength of 640 men. where
as full strength would be 2.000 men.
He is in doubt as to the fate of the
regiment not knowing whether it is in
danger of being mustered out or
whether it will be filled by men who
will be taken into the army by means
of the selective draft.
Governor Campbell said that all his
reports from Arizona were most grati
fying concemirng the efforts being
made to raise the $100,000 dollars
which Arizona is expected to raise for
the Red Ci'oss. At Phoenix Wednes
day nearly $10,000 were subscribed and
the work of canvassing the city was
nearly completed. He thinks that Ari
zona will raise much more than the al
lotted amount.
Mexican Soldiers
Cross Bridge and
Seize Labor Agent
(By Review Leased Wire.)
EL PASO, June 22. Three Mexican
soldiers kidnaped a Mexican labor
agent late today at the American end
of the international bridge. While the
United States army bridge guard had
his back turned, the soldiers crossed
the line, seized the labor agent and I
dragged him to the guard house on the j
Mexican side. General George Bell, j
Jr., has demanded his immediate re- i
lease and has given orders to the j
guards to fire on any soldiers crossing

There was more excitement in BIs
bee about the noon hour yesterday
than has been experienced for s'jiue
time. In the urst pmce one of the
firemen at the city hall was engaged
in whitewashing the interior of the
room in which are stored the battery
cells of the new fire alarm system. He
endeavored to put on a finishing touch
in one corner, when the box on which
he was standing gave way. He and
the whitewash went down and. in fall
ing, they knocked over the fop row of
battery cells, which started the system
working. Barney Norton and the bal
ance of the crew heard the fall and
rushed in to pick up the wreck, when
a fire alarm came in from box 42, on
Main street. The work was stopped
and the apparatus made a quick run
to the Bisbee dye worxs, where the
cleaning tank in the rear of tne build
ing had taken fire and the flames
caught onto the main building. The
flames were subdued by the use of the
chemical without much loss. AlAiut
this time another long and continuous
bellow of the cow was heard and there
was a wild scramble as both trucks
rushed down Main street to reach box
32, at the Old Opeta house. This was
found to be nothing but a short circuit
caused by the battery cells being up
set The trucks, in coming down Main
street, separated, tine going down the
Subway and the other turning up the
corner by the Alien block. The hun
dreds of children and men on the
streets at the time were at a loss which
way to go, then, to see the fire, as they
were of the opinion that there were
two, and there was a race in every d
rection.
The damage to the fire house was
slight and the system put in Working
order in a few moments after the
firemen had returned to the station
The damage at the Bisbee dye works
amounted to several hundred dollars,

NEW YORK. June 22. Recoveries .
from the general reaction of the early j
week made progress today, although I
trading was of a tentative character
and more circumscribed as to the va
riety of issues dealt in. War shares
were conspicious features, but rails
gave promise of improvement. Gross
gains of 1 to 5 points were consid
erably reduced in the later profit tak
ing. The monetary situation continued a
retraining influence on call loans,
which held over the week, being made
for the most part at or within a frac
tion of six per cent. United States
eel at one time showed an extreme
gain of 1'i, points, most others of that
division rising V to 2i. but in al
most every instance much of the ad
vantage was forfeited.
Metals and inactive specialties im
proved an average of a point or two
with sugars. Industrial Alcohol fin
ished at a point gain after having
risen over 3. Rails in general lost
much of their 1 to 2' point advances.

CHICAGO GRAINS.
CHICAGO, June 22. Bullish con
structions put on the Kansas crop re-j
port helped to strengthen wheat prices
today and so too did reports that ar
rangements had been completed to in
crease tonnage available for ship
ments to Europe. The market closed
strong S'a to 7 net higher with July
at 2.10 and September at 1.S4. Other
commodities scores gains corn 2 to
4Vi; oats Q to 1 and provisions
five to CO.
Wheat almost constantly had a de
cided upward slant. The July option
in particular showed buoyancy. The
chief bullish aspect of the Kansas
crop report was the fact that not
withstanding an estimated production
cf 2,000,000 bushels more than the
May forecast the 1917 crop of the
state would be 5S per cent below the
output last year and would stand as
the smallest since 1S96.
Persistent buying of corn for ex
port at relatively high premiums gave
a big lift to the corn market Oats
hardened with com. Buying on the
part of the houses with seaboard con
nections more than offset favorable
crop reports.
Pork rose to the highest price on
record, $40.10 a barrel for September

AMERICA AND MITTELEUROPA.
n Germany, wrote Captain Mahan seven years ago,
now to be found the beginning and potentiality of an
ershadowing concentrated power." Its aims differed
om those of all the nations which had ever before sought
dominate Europe, even those which had so endeavored
ider the leadership of Philip II.. Louis XIV., and Napol
n; "the prototype of modern Germany is to be found
ther In the Roman Empire." That acute prognosticator
as seeking to arouse his countrymen, says the New
ork Times, to the fact that they had a close personal
ntercst in what was going on in Euroie. The title of
lis work was "The Interest of America in International
Conditions." In describing the growth of this "over
shadowing concentrated power" he treated Austria as no
longer an independent Power, but "lnMiiid to Germany
"as surely as the moon is hound to the earth, and
with it constituting a single group in the planetary sys
tem."
Last Suuday t'-e world learned of President Wjlaon's
incorporation is deferred half a century or not; they are
to all practical purposes a part of the new universal em
pire which Germany is founding, the Empire of Mittele
uropa. Should that empire be established on a sure founda
tion as the result of this war, the present territory of
Mitteleuropa, great as it Is, would be only a nucleus, only
a centre around which new conquests would be grouped.
After the breathing spell given by a short-sighted peace
"without annexations or indemnities," the new world em
pire could begin reaching out for her real conquests, her
world conquests. The lands she covets for her expansion
would lie invitingly before her, in Asia, Africa, and Amer
ica; she would only have to pick and choose where her
first aggression should fall,, whether in Brazil or Egypt
or India or Mexico. The other nations, crippled by the
war where she had been only strengthened by it through
the establishment of Mitteleuropa and Mitteleuropa has
been alrealy established "without open conquest of its
territory" would be unable to oppose her, thus aggrand
ized. If those nations cannot break up her scheme now,
as the President said, "we may never be able to unite or
show conquering force again in the great cause of human
liberty."
Reduced to its lowest terms, if Germany is not beaten
now, the next attack win be in all likelihood an attack
by the triumphant Empire of Mitteleuropa upon South
America, and it will begin with an assault upon the great
obstacle which Btands in the way of the conquest of South
America. That obstacle is the United States, and in such
battle we would fight for life with everything against
ns. "The meshes of that intrigue, said the President,
meaning the Intrigue by which "without open conquest'
Germany has annexed Mitteleuropa, "must be broken"
They must be broken if the United States is to live and
the Western Hemisphere to remain free. That is what
the interest of America in international conditions" has
become; that is the meaning for us of Mitteleuropa.

FINDING THE MISSING.
One of the works the King of Spain has been able to
do through his privileges as a neutral is to find some of
the war's missing men. Thousands of appeals are sent
to the palace by stricken parents, children and wives of
soldiers from all lands. Many of the cases are under the
direct supervision of the King. His personal secretary
attends to many more. Much of the work is carried on
through the Spanish embassies in foreign capitals.
A recent cable dispatch to the New York Times told
something of the vastness of this humanitarian work.
Out of about 200,000 cases, 150,000 have been definitely
traced. Many "missing" soldiers have been found in
prison camps alive. The death of many others has been
iroved, relieving the anguish of' suspense that is often
worse for those leit at nome man me oeam m meir
loved ones.
The king is using his influence to trace civilians, too.
Members of families scattered in the invaded sections ol
Belgium and France have been located and restored to
ach other. Many pardons for sentenced spies have been
secured.
It is a great and worthy relief work which the king
carries on faithfully regardless of the rank or position
of those who petition his help. .

PERSHING REALLY COMMANDS.
All Americans will take pardonable satisfaction in the
announcement that Gen. Pershing is to have command of
the American army he is taking to France, instead of
taking orders from any French or British officer. He
will be subject, of course, to the general plans of the
allied strategy board, and will hold a definite part of the
battle front in France, just as Gen. Haig does, and be re
sponsible independently for that section of the line.
The fact that it must necessarily be a pretty small
section at first will make no differenc. King Albert or
Belgium holds only a few miles, but within that limited
rone is an independent commander. Gen. rersning, wun
the small force now at his disposal, is comparable to
Vlbert and no American need scorn that comparison.
Later, when the present expedition has grown to mil
lionsas it probably will our army may be holding as
many mites of the western front as the British or French.
ind Gen. Pershing's effective power will nave risen 10
equality with that of Haig or Nivelle. In honor and self-
respect he is their equal now.

LOCAL BROKER OFFICES

New Law Requires Bond Also.
Law Which Went Into
Effect June 7lh Will Pro

Shops.
The local brokerage offices have re
ceived notices from Phoenix from the
secretary of state's office that it will
be necessary for them to fill out state
license blanks under the new law
which went into effect on tne 7th inst.
The new law places all brokers undei
the direct control of the state bank
examiner and eliminates the bucket
shep or irregular brokerage business.
The new license blanks must be filled
out within thirty days.
The new law provides that a broker
must pay a state license fee of $200

sum of $5,000. Four paragraphs ot
the law read:
"Section 7. The state bank examin

NO USE TO ASK.
Yesterday noon, when the fire
alarm was turned in. the local office
was besieged with calls from all parts
of Bisbee asking where the firm was.
To this inquiry the telephone opera
tors were compelledt to reply that
they did n'ot have the information. A
number of the subscribers to the
telephone company thought that the
Jm
Co.
mes
Better Get Yours Now
operators were not telling the truth,
but such was the case. I'nder the
new fire alarm system the calls go di
rect to the fire station, and the cen
tral office has no way of knowing
where the fire is any more than any
other resident of Bisbee. It is Up to
the citizens to learn the fire sisnals.
It will be appreciated by the manage
ment of the telephone company if here
after they will refrain from asking
central where the fire Is as the opera
tors will be compelled to answer as
they did yesterday.
