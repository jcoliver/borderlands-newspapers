had been completed when the second
class mail proposal was taken up un
der an agreement that it should be
debated three hours. 1
The tariff section, adding ten per
cent to all duties now imposed and
taxing nearly all articles no won the
free list 10 per cent, was retained
after, Representative Lenroot, of Wis
consin, had striven unsuccessfully to
eliminate the tariff on sugar.
An amendment was written into the
clause in the postal section adding
one cent to all first class mail charges
to provide that the rate on letters for
local delivery remain at two cents.

BOND SALE
Liberty Loan ,' Certificates To
Be Put On Market In Small
Denominations To Stimu
late Sale.
(By Review Leased Wire). .
NEW YORK. May 22. To enable
persons of small means to buy Liberty
Loan bonds on an Installment plan
tasis, the
Federar Reserve Bank of
New York, In conjunction with the
Liberty Loan committee is perfecting
a plan for the issuance of participa
tion certificates, it was announced to
night, j . ,
The certificates; probably will be In
denominations of $10, will bear the
same interest as bonds and may be
exchanged for bonds when the hold
ers accumulate ??0 worth..
Although it is not proposed to have
the certificates ' negotiable In the
sense of $10 bank notes, tbe commit
tee points out that they may become
so in course of time, this depending
entirely upon merchants and others
to whom, they may be tendered. The
committee expresses hope that stores
will buy the certificates and sell them
over their counters to persons who
would lik.e to buy bonds, but whose
means will not permit them to invest
as much as $50 or $100 at one time.
Still Another Plan ,
Another plan was announced by
the League of Co-operative Savings
and Loan Associations. And individ
ual with $1, the league has decided,
may purchase a bond on installments,
with the understanding that the bal
ance may be paid at the option of the
buyer any time within a year.
"Under this plan, in the event the
subscriber fails to pay for the bond
within a year, he may get back at
any time the amount he has sub
scribed with the accumulated interest
at tbe rate of 3 per cent, based on
ponthly balances,"' says the announce
ment. "The organization makes no
charges for the service." The league
states its offer is open to all and that
"purchasers are not required to fur
nish references of any sort."
Teddy Invests
iThe Federal Reserve Bank of New
York issued a statement tonight that
it had established a "special rate of
of re-discount of ZM per cent for
paper given 'for the purpose of pur
chasing Liberty Loan bonds of the
government about to be issued, such
paper having a maturity of not exceed
ing 90 days." This special rate, it
was stated, will apply to the re-dis
count of the paper which has been
secured by a pledge, from the custo
mer to the member bank, of the
United States bonds on interim re
ceipts there for United States certifi
cates of indebtedness.
In a letter today to Guy Emerson,
secretary of publicity of the Liberty
Loan Committee, Col. Theodore Roose
velt asserted It Is "The duty of every
man and woman In this country who
can possibly to afford to do so to buy
Liberty Bonds in order that guns,
ammunition, food and clothes may be
promptly and freely furnished to our
soldiers who go to the front" Col.
Roosevelt said he had invested in the
bonds.
"Sky Advertising"
As ,an encouragement to aviators
throughout the country to participate
during the week of June 4 in a "Lib

Field Marshal Haig Believes
Preparing To Launch An

(Br Review Leased Wire).
Although on both the British and
French fronts the period of virtual in
action continues, with trench raiding
operations by the British and artillery
duels of violence between the French
and Germans, it is not expected that
these conditions will long prevail.
The offensive of the British on the
Arras front cannot be deemed to have
ended until Field Marshal Haig's men
once more have thrown their strength
against the 2,000 yards of the Hlnden
burg line still held by the Germans
west of BulletOurt and straightened
out their line for the heavy blows that
are to come against tbe Drocourt

mans are placing dependence to ward

Bisbee, Ariz., May 21st, 1917.
Ajo Mining and Development Company,
Bisbee, Arizona.
Gentlemen:
We have made an exhaustive examination of your holdings and have found the representations as
made by ycur Manager, Mr. A. W. Eramwell, wholly truthful. 4
Your property comprises some 38 claims, 2i of which are located in the Gunsight Mountains and In
clude the famou Burro-Burro and C. and C. mines which were recently acquired by lease and bond. On
the Burro-Burro and C. and C. dumps are about 200 tons of good chipping ore.
On your holdings proper a good camp has been established and a shaft, now some 20 feet deep, is
being sunk on the Flapjack claim. From this shaft some 20 tons of shipping ore has been extracted,
while from .location shafts some 20 additional tons of shipping ore was taken out and is now lying on
the dumps. Truly a remarkable showing for the two months the company has been operating.
Ten claims owned by your Company are located adjoining the New Cornelia Copper Company a
proven mine. We confidently expect and have every reason to believe that the ore bodies proven to
exist by the' development of the New Cornelia Copper Company extend into and underlie these claims..
All officers of the Company are eminently qualified to fill their respective positions; none receive
any talary and are honestly bending every effort to develop a, mine

upon the stage. Every man and
woman In the audience rose and
cheered while tne baud played "The
Star Spangled Banner."
Before discussing tne Liberty Loan,
Mr. McAdoo t'jld his hearers war was
"just as unescapable for the American
people as it is to escape the rising ot
tomorrow's sun."
Not Fighting Germans.
After repeating President Wilson's
statement that the United States is not
j fighting the Gtnuan people but the
I "German military system which is try
ing to enslave the world," Mr. McAdoo
j referred to the new dwuocracy of Rus
j sia, "t'j who.se people we have just
'extended recognition and to whom I
: have just, in the exercise of powers
conferred upon me by congress, ex
tended a credit of $100,000,000 to let
j them understand that America's pro
fession of friendship and support are
not lip service."
This is the only kind of war. Mr. Mc
Adoo said, in which the United States
.c'juld afford to engage.
I . "We would not go into any war for
material ends," he said. "We woula
not lift a finger to take a square inch
of the soil of any other nation. We do
not want any indemnities or any com
pensation for what we do in this war.
We are fighting fjr an ideal, which is
the only thing that makes any natiun
', great. We do not intend to be drawn
on the chariot wheels of any military
autocracy, as poor, bleeding Belgium
has been for the past three years, and
as. Serbia has been for the same period
of time.
j "And when America sit3 at tha:
council table f peace she must bear
upon her brow the crown of justice
and in her eyes must shine the light of
liberty and love of humanity.
! Describes Needs
"That is the problem," he continued.
"What must we do fj meet it? Wars
cannot be fought without money. The
first step in this war, the most effec
tive step that we could take, wa3 to
provide the money for its conduct."
Mr. McAdoo then related the mon
' etary steps already taken the au
thorization by congress of a five bil
; lion dollar credit and the extension
by the government of credits total
, ling $625,000,000 to the Entente al
lies. j "But it makes no difference," hq
' added, "how much credit we extend,
; we are extending it for a service
; which t Is essential for our own pro-
', lection. '
"This money is not goin? out of the
country," bp said. "AH of this financ- '
ing is largely a matter of shifting
credits; It is nrt going to Involve any
less of gold: it 1r. not going to Involve j
r.uy loss of values. These moneys !
are going to be put. bnck into oireu- J
lation. put back, promptly into the
channels of business and circulated ,
and re-circulated to take care of ab
rormal prosperity of the country a
prosperity that will te greater in the
present year than ever before in our ;
history." !

800,000. or IS per cent of the total
financing to be done. "ICighteen per

! "The amount of indemnity you j

After the meeting at the auditor

honor at a luncheon at the country ;

NEW YORK. May 22. Indecision
marked the early course of today's
active and broader markc't, but this
condition was almost wholly rectified
in the fnal hour when United States
Steel lead the general list to new
maximums for the current movement.
Trading covered wider scope, taking
in to a greater extent than recently
the rails, metals, oils, and sp-?cialties.
Wail Street professed to see favor
able portents in the dec!sion of the
United States Supreme Court which
postponed re-arguments of Impending
"trust" suits for a tear. The grow
ing popularity of the Liberty Loan
was another encouraging influenc.
There were intimations also of an
early rnnouncement by tie interstate
commerce commission regarding li e
plea of the railroads for increased
rates.. United States Steel's steady
advance of 13 points to the new r
ord of !27i put that stock within 2E8
pci::ts of its record.
Coppers and allied shaTCs were
hirher by one to two po'iits on very
large accumulation. G?:i:s in this
grrup ran from one to two points.
Al! classes of mils wre included
in the one to two points advances.
Total sales 1.205,000 shares.
Ecr.ds were regular and lacking in
spec! feitures. Total sales, par
value, $2,370.0. United States bonds
were unchanged on call rut coupon
three's- fell half per cent on sales.
today tint business was reduced for
the most part to scanty dealings in
a sincle option Sept-mber. Hearish
crop adices had a depressing effect.
The market clored unsettled one to
five cmts net lower with July at 2.32
and September at 2.05. Corn gained
Vt to a,ai and onts 1 os!it at -Xt to
ai. Provisions finished irregular,
ranging fron 10 off to 3 at 7 advanc?.
Predictions current that a com
plete st on of all option business in
wheat soon might be witnessed as a
result of ev'stifg arbitrary niles
were not mmnimouslv arreed to.
Unlimited short selling is si ill per
missible and enough of it has been
dr-velopi.Mg to cvj:'0 a material con
stant sebac!--j in prices of late.
The principal fsoior today was the
confidence which cr.Tp advices pave
that the government's May fiuures on
the domestic yie'd would be exceeded
to a substantial degree.
Con prices bulged on account of
the scarcity of rash offerings and be
cause of continued cold weather and
lack of sunshine.
Slowness of shipping demand from
the eat ac'ed later as a weight on
9
oats quotations.
Holders of provisions displayed evi
dent willingness to realize. Hfeher
prices on hops were 'more than offset.

STRIKE IN JEROME
(Special to The Review)
JEROME, Mpy 22. There has been
development of strong public senti
ment against the proposed strike call
voted by the Western Federation lo
cal, numbering less than a sixth of
the men employed In the district. If
this sentiment "prevails, the situation
here will clear without the trouble
that has been anticipated.
Granting by the companies of the
Mian' I sca'e of wns.es removed thfl
only cause that had been advanced
for a strike, except the demand for
a closed shop. Only the radicals of
the Federaton and the I. W. W. ele
ment are now urging a strike.
These are declaring that the large
war demand for copper makes It im
perative that the copper mines keep
going and that consequently there is
mofe chance to win the closed shop
at this time than any other. The
closed shop question was not Includ
ed in the first agitation of labor at
Jerome, which commenced several
months ago.
It is learned that a canvass of the
working forces in mines and smelters
of the district has developed that
more than seventy per cent of the
men are opposed to a strike and will
disregard any s'rike call. The num
ber of those taking this attitude In
creases as the advance granted in
wages and other features of the move
ment are considered.
There has never been any real sup
port of the labor agitation among the
majority of the workers of the dis
trict. I. W. W. and other violent la
hor disturbers have brought in from
among their own kind the men who
have urged a strike.

FUTILITY OF RETRACTIONS.
Newspapers and newspaper men have a constitutional
dislike for retractions. They believe, and rightly so, that
the retraction usually amounts to an exaggeration of the
original article and does more harm than good. The
general public, however, believes that by printing new
facts, or facts placed in a different light, certain news
may be rectified.
In the gathering of news there is great chance for mis
take. It is trully remarkable that so few mistakes creep
into the papers of the country. When it is considered that
an eight page daily changes, approximately, thirty five
columns, or thirty five thousand words,' every day the
mistakes and inaccuracies pale into insignificance. The
reporter who secures information, on which newspapers
build their printed matter, is liable to error. In the
majority of cases, however, the reporter is blamed for
a mistake, due to his informant.
It may be rightly charged that the reporter and the
newspaper man should carefully scrutinize the character
of his news source. This is done in nearly every case.
OfTtimes, however, the news source is in error.
After news is placed on a typewriter and "headed" it
then goes into the composing room. The head of the
article goes one direction and the article, proper, to a
linotype machine. After the type is set a proof is taken
and a proof reader goes over the sheeL This personage is
supposed to catch the mistakes. Sometimes proofreaders
read by copy that is follow the original article while
reading the printed, version and many mistakes are
eliminated. In the smaller establishments this is ex
pensive and is, more often than not, dispensed with.
Knowing the public and its attitude toward news the
editor and reported dislike going into infinite detail in
correcting some mistake. Some people appear to think
that many mistakes have been made maliciously. Noth
ing could be farther from the truth. A newspaper prides
itself on the cleanliness of 'its product and its freedom
from errors. Then, too, the reporter knows that to print
a retraction the former case must be explained. In near
ly every instance it would have been better to allow the
original article go unchallenged. It brings attention to
mistakes which are sometimes uncomfortable, both to
the object of the article and to the paper.
As a case in point, the Tucson Citizen, of Monday, car
ried an excellent example. The original article was tame
in comparison to the retraction. Read and see whether
this retraction was not more of an aggravation than a
correction:
"Doing the best it could to lighten the gloom of war.
The Citizen on Friday printed the following squib:
"He (Lieutenant Quesenberry) was shown Menlo park,
but was advised by Mr. Hofmeister that it was unsuitable
owing to the mud proclivities of the adobe soil in wet
weather. Life in the trenches is one long mud pie frolic
and if training for' mud was desired, Menlo park would
probably be a good place.
"Mr. Hofmeister is responsible only for the statement
that the adobe soil in Menlo park, like all adobe soil, has
a muddy dispostiion. The rest of the squib is a bit of
editorial humor that exploded prematurely.
"The explosion caught H. E. Schwalen. who is the chief
censor for the Pima Realty & Trust company, guardians
of Menlo park, at a dour moment. He demands an ex
planation, with which The Citizen blandly obliges.
"The vain purpose of the writer of this squib was tc
boast that the adobe soil of Tucson is the equal, in plastic
qualities, of any in France. The fine deep soil of Menlo
park, so excellent for planting the umbrageous shade
tree, the ornate shrub, the graceful vine and the verdant
lawn, had been forcefully and forcibly impressed on his
subconsciousness by the fame to which the elysian fields
beyond the Santa Cruz have justly attained as a residence
section and it was a natural step to prefer this adobe
in mention over that in any other locality although the
environs of the city are richly endowed adobely.
"Although the natural proclivities of the adobe in
Menlo park are as stated, so thoroughly have they been
curbed by the management by means of broad and well
drained boulevards that Cinderella herself would not
have soiled her dainty slippers as with the dew did she
tread the Menlo park thoroughfare even after a downpour."
America must win this war, for there will be no Amer
ica if she loses.
SALVAGING SUBMARIZED SHIPS.
Germany is said to be contemplating the creation of a
new and highly profitable industry after the war salvag
ing torpedoed ships. German naval engineers have per
fected a process by which it will be easy to raise ships
from the bottom of the sea unless they lie at a great
depth. The big majority of the merchantment sunk by
U-boats have gone down in the shallow waters around
the British Isles, where the problem is comparatively
simple.
The Hamburger Fremdenblatt estimates that the ves
sels sunk in "favorable positions" in February alone are
worth $180,000,000. The sea floor will soon be carpeted
with many hundreds of hulls and many hundreds of mil
lions of dollars' worth of merchandise.
If the ships themselves can be raised and repaired.
Germany will thus have an easy way of restoring her de
pleted merchant fleet In the case of many vessels the
repairs necessary to make them seaworthy would entail
no great difficulty, once they were floated. The cargoes
that might be saved, consisting of goods little affected by
salt water, would be of incalulable value.
It sounds feasible. There is one flaw, however, in the
German plan. If Germany can raise sunken ships, so
can other countries. And there is no reason. for suppos
ing that her enemies will leave her a monopoly of the
business.
An American system for doing almost the same thing
was worked out several years ago, and has actually been
put in operation to a small extent. It contemplated not
the raising of the ships, but the saving of the cargoes.
A company was actually organized in New York City,
including several hard-headed metropolitan business men,
to finance the project. One of the things particularly
aimed at was 'the salvaging of the gold and other valu
ables that went down with the Titanic. Several other
notable wrecks of recent years were regarded as access
ible prizes. The promoters were also said to intend seek-ing-old
Spanish treasure ships that went down centuries
ago with their freight of gold from Mexico and Peru.

THE U-BOAT MENACE.
The recent U-bcat scare proves to have been not al
together justified. "Although there has been an alarming
increase in the number of merchantmen sunk in the lat
few week3, the normal movement of ocean commerce has
not been checked. In fact, the latest reports of British
trade show a surprising increase.
Great Britain imported $325,000,000 worth of goods in

Aids Nature and Keeps the Scalp
CSean From Dandruff
R- rn&ble care and effort are all

ary woman to have good hair. When
the l.fiir falls out and is stringy, un
even, dry, brittle and generally un

due to dandruif.
Before the hair will grow naturally
and luxuriantly, the scale-like accu

what Newbro's
Herpicide docs.
It is an aid to
nature. Herpi
cide keeps the
so;;!p clean, adds a softness and lus
ter to the hair which indicates health.
It rut only prevents the hair from
falling out but causes it to become

Proper Food for Weak Stomachs.
The porper food for one man may be
all wrong for another. Every one
should adopt a diet suited fj his age
and occupation. Those who have weak
stomachs need to be especially care
ful and should eat slowly and masti
cate their food thoroughly. It is also
important that they keep their bowels
regular. When they become constipat
ed 'or when they feel duull and stupid
after eating, they should take Cham
berlain's Tablets to strengthen the
stomach and move the bowels. They
are easy to take and pleasant in effect.
