STANDARD OIL COMPANY WINS TAX
FIGHT IN ARIZONA; GETS INJUNCTION
SN FRANCISCO, May 5. The
Standard Oil company of Califor
nia today won its fight aganqt the
state tax commission of Arizona,
through a decision of the United
States circuit court of appeals
granting a temporary injunction
against the tax commission in
creasing the 1917 assessed valua
tion of the company from $342,
706 to $2,910,579. A decision of
the United States district court of

that the Arizona valuation figures
included assets which were -in the

PEACE MEET SUMMARY
(By the Associated Press.)
The peace treaty formulated by the
allied and associated powers ia to be
handed to the German delegates at
Versailles Wednesday afternoon, defi
nite announcement to this effect hav
ing been made today.
SIgnor Orlando,.Italian premier, and
his foreign minister. Baron Sonnino,
are returning to Paris . from Rome,
where they have been since they quit
the peace conference and there seems
to be good basis for belief that the
differences between Italy and the
United States, Great Britain and
France will be settled.
With the Italian question disposed
of, almost complete unanimity of sen
timent wouid prevail in the peace con
ference. The obstacle represented by
the protests of the Belgians 'has been
surmounted by the Belgian crown
council having decided unanimously
to sign the . treaty, it having been
pointed out by the head of the Belgian
delegation that the document gave
honorable and satisfactory terms to
Belgium.
China's protest against the award
of Klao-Shau to Japan and a number
of smaller, items are yet under discus
sion. The council of three sat Mon
day afternoon in an endeavor to settle
the minor ones.
A plenary session of the peace con
ference is to be held Tuesday after
noon at which the peace treaty is to
be presented to the'smalled powers.
decision in San Francisco today. The
further opinion was expressed, how
ever, that no attack would be made
on the mine tax law by the mining
companies, the majority of whom had
submitted so' far to the commission's
valuations.
It was pointed out that when the
Standard Oil protest ' came before
Judge Sawtelle, he denied the motion
for a restraining order because the
company had other recourse through
the superior courts of the 13 counties
of Arizona in which the Standard Oil
operates. Now, It ia stated, the action
will come back to the federal court
here for trial on its merits.
NOTICE RECEIVED HERE
The law firm of Ellinwood & Ross,
hn instituted suit for the temporary
injunction against Ihe ,tax commission I
on behalf of the Standard Oil company,
received a . telegram from San Fran
cisco last evening notifying them that
the injunction had . been granted.
The injunction also restrains the
county attorneys and tax collectors of
13 Arizona counties, including all save
Apache, from collecting any of the in
creased tax sought by the state com
mission. As affecting the validity of
the entire scheme of taxation inaugu
rated by the tax commission and state
board of equalizaUon, the suit of the
Standard Oil company has attracted
widespread interest throughout the
state.
A copy of the decision of the United
States circuit court is being mailed
Ellinwood & Ross and should be re-
' ceived here in a day or so.

FOR VICTORY LOAN IS
ISSUED BY CHAIRMAN
Today Is Arizona Loan Day?
Gaines Issues Message;
Appeal From Glass
CALL TO WARREN DISTRICT
Today being proclaimed Victory
day by the governor of Arizona, I
call upon the people of the Warren
district to marshal all their efforts
in helping to make the loan a suc
cess and I appoint every individual
a committee of one to go out and
get as many Liberty bonds as they
can and have them ready to turn
in to the banks on Wednesday
morning. The days that remain in
which to go over the top with our
quota are few and the amount is
large. It is only by the individual
efforts of everyone in the commun
ity that we can expect to make tt a
success. My faith in the citizens
of the Warren district is still, un
shaken. I know that the people of
the Warren district will not break
their pledge with those who gave
their lives.
J. N. GAINES,
County Chairman, Victory Liberty
Loan Committee.
With only five days remaining in
which to go over the top with the
Victory loan quota for Cochise county
and with nearly 1500,000 yet to be
raised, indications point to a very ac
tive week of soliciting in which all
the efforts of the individuals of the
district will be mustered for the final
drive. Total subscriptions up to last
night as reported by Chairman Gaines
amount to J275.550. The amount that
will have to be raised if Cochise coun
ty equals its quota amounts to nearly
1100,000 daily.
Work in the mines is proceeding
favorably and during the remaining
days it is thought that the individual
subscriptions from the miners will
help swell the total to a point where
the successof the loan will be prac
tically assured.' Following are the
amounts reported by the working com
mittees in the various mining shafts,
with several shafts still to be heard
from :
Holbrook $2300 reported by G. A.

and will not fight for a purse, which
is against the laws of Ohio.
"Having consulted my atorneys,"
he said, "I find that I am entirely
within the laws of Ohio, according
to a court decision on such cases.
Therefore, I have accepted Toledo's
offer to hold the boxing exhibition
there.
"Under the Ohio law the mayor of
Toledo is permitted to grant consent.
Under decision of the court one is
privileged to employ boxers to give
exhibitions when a purse is not fought
for."
An octagon shaped arena to accom
modate between fifty and sixty thou
sand spectators will be erected at a
point convenient to the city. Admis
sion charges will range from $5 to $50,
according to the location of the seats.
Both pugilists will train for at least

DON'T PAY TELEPHONE
BILLS, BUSINESS MEN
OF DISTRICT ADVISED
Business men of the Warren Dis
trict are advised by the Warren Dis
trict Commercial club not to pay their
telephone bills If they show an ad
vance ever last month, at least until
May 10. The Commercial club bases
Ita advice on the attitude of the Cor
poration Commission of Phoenix,
which has refused to permit inagu
ratlon of the new advanced rates by
the telephone companies. Definite
advice for further action will be
i available before May 10, says the
1 Commercial club, and the telephone
bills do not become delinquent until
May 15. j
The Commercial club statement was J
issued fololwing the receipt by busi- j
ness houses of the district within the '
past few days of advanced bills for
business telephone service. Moan
time the corporation commission had
refused to allow the advances of the
telephone companies, an d business
men of the district were at a los3
whether they should pay the new
rates or not. Secretary T. A. Egan of
the Commercial club communicated !
yesterday with A. A. Betts, chairman
of the corporation commission.
"Mr. Petts advises all business men
to hold up payment on bills showing
the advanced rate until at least May
10," declared Mr. Egan yesterday.
"The corporation commission is seek
ing a court order restraining the tele
phone company from collecting the
mat
new rates, which have been refused
by the commission. A decision on
this question will doubtless be had
before May 10. Bills, however, do
not become delinquent until after May
15, and withholding payment until
that date will in no way effect the
telephone service to the individual. In
the event Xhe commission secures its
court order of restraint, many busi
ness houses will be saved trouble and
bookkeeping expenses if they await
the outcome of the case before re
mitting to the company."
Mr. Betts has agreed to advise the
Commercial club of any new develop
ments in the case and to keep resi
dents of the district posted. Mr. Egan
will announce any advice received
from the commission as soon as it arrives.

Libeling the Borderland
Attempts at 'libeling the Borderland by residents of that section of
highway, north of Cochise county se eking to secure the Bankhead mili
tary highway routing, have been resorted to in final hour desperation.
from Gila county the cry of fakir and robber is now reaching out. One
of the newspapers of the Globe-Miami district is fosteirng the wail.
"Should the l.orderlund route be selected instead of the Apache
trail, the trip of the Bankhead pathfindftrs'to this section of the state,
was a pure and simple camouflage, and unless 1 am badly mistaken, this
will be the final result," declares the secretary of the Globe chamber
of commerce in this paper.
The secretary has several arguments on which to base his opposi
tion to the Borderland route ,as compared with the Apache trail. In
part he outlines the objections to the Borderland as follows:
"To the casual observer there are many debatable points involved
the most peitiner.t being the close proximity o fthe Borderland route
to the Mexican frontier. A road constructed along the lines prescribed
in the Bankhead questionaire, woul d afford an excellent opportunity for
a band of Mexican brigands to rob, pillage and destroy every bank and
public building, and murder every inhabitant in the towns of Douglas,
Lofweil, Bisbee, Tombstone, Benson and Tucson, in a period of 24 hours
and make their escape unharmed.
"As a commercial road it is not to be considered, and as a tourist
route it is nut now, never was, and never will be popular and pertinent
to the best interests and comfort of the tourist or traveling public. With
the mercury flirting with the torid, heat at 120. degrees in the shade
(and there is no shade on the borderland route) no white man will
ever make a second trip over tfrut route. The burning sand of ' the
Sahara is a refrigerator compared with the proposed Borderland route.
Therefore the adoption of the Borderland route as a military strategic
route is a positive falacy and its adoption as a commercial or tourist
route is equally preposterous."
Should the cities and citizens of the southern part of Arizona wish
to "throw mud" in the same manner as ore those; of Gila county, an
argument with much more truth and veracity against the Apache trail,
and containing no element of libel could be established. However, Co
chise county has gone out after the Bankhead routing in every spirit
of fairness, and will maintain this spirit even at the loss of the routing.
The southern part of the state bases its claims on absolute fact and
on highway construction, and Cochise county has presented these facts
and highway advancement features before the Bankhead pathfinders.
It Gila county has done the same( and we presume they have, we are
willing to accept the finding of the pathfinders without reference to
"positive falacity" or "simple camouflage" such has has characterized
the Gila statements cf the" Borderland.
In the first place, the secretary of the. Globe chamber of commerce
has overlooked the cardinal point in the establishment of the Bankhead
highway that the route will be and is an official military highway. Its
proximity to the border, because of this fact, is absolutely essential it is
, intended as a link for military posts, especially the posts along the border,
including those at Douglas, Lowell, Fort Huachuca, Nogales and else
where in this territory. The suggestion of. raids on Douglas, Lowell,
J.isbcc, Tombstone, Tucson and Benson is the most "positive falacity"
yet presented as an argument against the Borderland route. .
Residents of that district traversed by the Borderland readily admit
that at seasons the temperature is high. However, they do not admit
that he heat is more oppressive than that of the Apache trail route,
and they can safely say that they do not burn up rubber on either route.
The scales balance on this argument; but if there is an advantage it
accrues to the Borderland.
We do not fear attacks of this character on the Borderland. The one
fact that the Borderland is already considered a link in half-dozen trans
continental highways, and has been for years, while the Apache trail
has maintained since its construction a reputation as a "side trip" is
argument enough to convince the average tourist and traveler of the
merits of the Borderland.
The Borderland has placed its case in the hands of the Bankhead
path finders on merit only; it is seeking no advantage through adver
tising other highway's disadvantages. The reputation of the Borderland
is established definitely. On this reputation, on its merit as a military
strategic, border link, and on its superior highways, it has gone before
the pathfinders. On these features it rests its case, assured that it will
secure a square deal without "camouflage."
The Temperamental Housemaid
An opera singer who gets $150,000 a year goes up in the air and
we tall it temperament. The idea is that if we're going to have grand
opera then we've got to have a high strung woman who gets cranky and
bawls out the service, the kitchen, the laundry, the dry cleaners, the
florist, and the new gown that hang it all, O everybody's against me
camy with a spot on it.
But housemaids and cooks are different, as a general rule. They are
a mystery, Usually when they quit, nobody knows why. It's a secret
they keep to themselves. They explain, but they know and the rest
of the house knows the explanation is only half the story, if it's that
much.
Sphinxes that's what the cook and housemaids are these clays.
Our best medicine men and psychologists and high-ups in learning try
to read1 these sphinxes and write magazine articles on how to keep a
good cook or house girl. And it's no go. They can't tell us.
A good classy girl who knows how to keep a kitchen straight,
and wash babies and dress babies right, is a mystery to herself. She
quits when she wants to quit and not before then nor till then. And
of course, when she wants to quit then it's up to her to find another
place, to go somewhere else. And when she goes she is a mystery
to herself like the tribes of Israel starting for the Promised Land or
Columbus on his way to undiscovered America.
A sphinx, a mystery, to herself as well as others, she demands the
right to be as temperamental as a $150,000 a year opera singer, retreat
ing instinctively behind the impregnable fact that while opera singers
have temperament, they never have housemaid's knee.
The London times recently had an interview with a titled Eng
lishwoman who said that a housemaid should be called "Miss" and
referred to as a "home bird." This would be democracy in the home.
Home bird that sounds poetic. And a real home bird, the real tiling,
flits and wings her way hither and yon from cellar to garret keeping
the place clean. She is a helper and builder, the human wren.
Secretary Daniels has either exonerated the camp at Brest or white
washed it, and in either case it is no longer suitable for political capital.
State department officials doubt whether Hungary's acceptance of
bolshevism was inspired by Germany. Are these the same officials who
doubted whether Germany would resume unrestricted murder at sea?
You tan say this much for a dog! If he sucks eggs or kills sheep,
he looks the part. He doesn't wear a halo and pose as an important
citizei.
The Cruoadeis have finished their fight, but the fellow who married
to keep from going is now wondering if Sherman really f,aid that about
war.
Captain tozzi of Orlando's staff says Ituly will take what she
vuti it the conference duetn't give U to her. Then v.hy waste time
trying to persuade other nations?

stunts, no "hurry-up."
Her quiet, patient way with
VELVET during its two years age
ing in wooden hogsheads, brings out
all the kindly comfort of fine Ken
tucky Burley leaf.
The quicker, less expen
sive methods cannot possi
bly produce the fragrance,
coolness and downright
pipe qualities of VELVET,
cured in Nature's way.
Today it is your privilege
to enjoy, with hundreds of
thousands of other smok
ers, this mild and friendly
VELVET tobacco.

BY REVIEW
STOCKS AND BONDS
NEW YORK, May 5 The relative
ly moderate session of the stock ex
change today moderate in the sense
that recent spectacular elements were
lacking was primarly due to tomor
row's recess in honor of the parade of
the 77th division.
Trading again attained the broad
proportions of the past three .weeks,
but selling for profits was effective to
the extent that some issues were ir
regular or distinctly heavy.
Standard or dividend paying trans
portations were active and strong.
Canadian Pacific led the rails for a
while at an extreme advance of al
most 5 points, part of which was later
cancelled.
Delaware, Lackawanna and West
ern, most closely held of all the gilt
edged rails, gained 17 points, and
other coalers and cotton carriers, rose
2 to 5 points.
The inquiry for secondary rails
abated somewhat, but advances of 1
or 2 points were numerous in that di
vision, St. Louis and San Francisco,
St. Louis Southwestern and Pittsburg
and West Virginia leading at 1 to 3
points.
Oils, equipments, shipping and food
shares were represented by Texas
company, Associated Oil, most inde
pendent steels, Atlantic-Gulf and
Sugars at extreme advances of 2 to
8 points, but United States Steel
bade only a nominal gain. Sales
amounted to 1,375,000 shares.
The general bond market was ir
regular, Liberty ' and foreign issues
displaying moderate steadiness. Total
sales, par value, aggregated $13,750,
000. Old United States bonds were
unchanged on call.
THE GRAIN MARKET
CHICAGO, May 5. One of the se
verest breaks ever witnessed in the
corn market took place today as a
result of definite notice that the
United States would import wheat
from Canada and that a downward re
vision o the cost of foodstuffs was
looked for. In a few minutes the price
of corn shriveled 12 cents a bushel.
Violen reactions, however ensued. The
market closed excited at 3c to 4c net
decline .with July $6.15514 to $1.65
;and CSeptember $1.60 to $6,160. Oats
finished lVzc to 2c down and pro
visions varying from 12c off to 5c ad
vance.
First reports about conditions in the
United States governments and Can
adian wheat were exaggerated and in
fact while largely true, the steep de
scent of corn as well as the rebound
were unjustified. The rumors which
preceded authoritative advices were
to the effect that all important re
strictions on Canadian wheat into the
United States had been taken off.
Oats were swayed entirely by the
wild fluctuations of corn. '
In the face of the sensational down
turn of grain, provisions held relative
ly firm in line with the hog market.
All of the day's advances in packing
house products, however, were vir
tually wiped out.

"FAN FAN" AND
SUNSHINE COMEDY
ON SAME BILL AT
THE EAGLE TODAY
Through the wonderful gardens and
quaint villages of old Japan is woven
a colorful tale that is gorgeously pic
turized in the 1919 William Fox ex
travaganza "Fan Fan," which will be
shown for the first time at the Eagle
theater today.
The clever Fox Kiddies, who will be
remembered for their remarkable work
in "Jack and the Beanstalk" and
"Aladdin and the Wonderful Lamp,"
are again to be seen in this production.
Their characterizations make these ex
traordinarily clever extravaganzas
noteworthy productions in these days
of intensely dramatic pictures.

-FAN TAN'
WILLIAM I
FOX PBOPUCTION
To say that "Fan Fan" is a bur
lesque of the serious emotions and
vanities of their elders by these child
actors is hardly correct. The fact
that they do take grown-up role and
that they portray these characters
with all the seriousness and manner
isms that go with the parts is real
comedy when it is realized that they
are children but this is art, and not
burlesque.
On the same bill with "Fan Fan" the
great Fox Sunshine comedy entitled
'Roaring Lions on the Midnight Ex
press" will be shown. Adv.
BOOZE IN MEDICINES
. TO FOOL THE SICK
Read the label. You can bank on it
if the label reads 18 to 20 per cent
alcohol that such a medicine depends
on its whisky effect to sell it. Most
of these, "wonderful" tonics and "mas
ter medicines" make the patient feel
temporarily better from the stimulat
ing ewwect while at the same time
they are undermining health.
' Number 40 For The Blood" con
tains but 9 per cent alcohol and you
can not drink it "ad libitum." One
teaspoonful is a dose for an adult. It
is an old doctor's prescription and has
been successfully employed in blood
poison, mercurial and lead poisonnig.
scrofula, rheumatism, catarrh, consti

ELLEN BEACH YAW
Elian Beach Yaw, the foremost of
American concert singers, is booked
for the Grand theater one night,
Thursday, May S.
Miss Yaw will be accompanied by
Miss Georgiella Lay, one of the most
proficient of concert pianists and mus
ical students should welcome the en
gagement with delight.'
Probably no singer before the public
has such superb technique at her con
trol. Miss Yaw's trills, range of voice
and ease of expression are of constant
delight. She has complete command
of her voice and her sudden changes
in tone and quality now soaring like
a nightingale and then a soft, faint
echo, gives her the right to the title
of the finished and versatile artist.
She wins the hearts of her audience
trom the very first.
Seats for the engagement which is
for but one night are now selling at
the Lyric theater box office. Adv.
