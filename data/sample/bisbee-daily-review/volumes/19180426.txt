One of the most important phases of America's military establishment in France has been the building of

Withdrawal by Allies on
Bailleul-Wytschaete Sector;
Battle Continuing.
By Review Leased Wire)
LONDON, April 25. Australian and
English troops have re-captured Vil-lers-Bretonneux
and taken more than
Coo prisoners in that region. Field Mar
shal Haig imports from headquarters
tonight.
Further to the north on a line from
Baiileul to Wytschaete there has been
v?ry heavy fighting and the allied
troops were obliged to withdraw from
their positions.
The statement says:
"The French and British positions
from noith of Bailleul to east of Wyts
chaete have been heavily attacked all
day. There wasfight ing of great se
verity on the whole of this front, par
ticularly in the neighborhood of Dran
outre, Keinvl and Vierstraat.
Make Withdrawals
"In the course of repeated attacks
and counter attacks the allied troops
have been compelled to withdraw from
th " posiiions they held this morning,
and the fighting continues.
"South ot the Soinme several counter
attacks launched by Australian and
English troops last night against the
position- gained by the enemy yes
terday in anil around Yillers-HnHon-
; neiix carried our line onward to with

"Th? "iiemy's attack yesterday
ii!oriii!( on this front was made by
at least four divisions and his ob
jectives are stated by prisoners to have
included tin village of Cachy and the
Cachy-Fouiller wood. These object
ives were not reached at any point.
Tim number of German dead found in
the posiiions recaptured by our troops
show that the enemy's losses were
very heavy."
The rumor that the Germans hav?
reached the crest of Mont Kemmel is
not confirmed. Four and possibly
six German divisions delivered an at

BRITISH MATERIAL1
LOSS DURING BIG
BATTLE ENORMOUS
Losses All Replaced, While'
Ammunition Reserves Are
Large Enough to Continue
Struggle Until Winter.
(By Review Leased Wire) .
LONDON. April 25. Winston Spen
cer Churchill, introducing in the house
of commons today, the estimates for
the miniEtry of munitions of which he
is the head, said that during the fivo
weeks since the battle in France had
begun they had been passing through
the greatest strain regarding the sup
ply of war material that had occurred
in the experience of the ministry.
Not only had the consumption and
destruction of munitions of all kinds
been preceding at the greatest rate,
but there also were very heavy losses
by capture by the enemy.
1,000 Guns Lost
"We lost," the minister said, "near
ly a thousand guns by shell fire or
capture; between 4000 and 5000 ma
chine guns havrs been last or destroyed
and a quantity of ammunition, apart
from that which had been fired and
that which has been lost in the dumps
amounted to something between one
and three weeks' total of manufac
ture. "Other war materials have been
used or lost on a similar scale, but by
the end of last week all the losses
had been made good and in many
cases moret ban made good.
Plenty Ammunition Left
"Vast quantities of small arm am
munition have been lost or left be
hind, but, breat as the demand has
been the expenditure in the last month
did not exceed the maximum poten
tial capacity of the British factories
without touching enormous reserves,
which had accumulated against such
a contingency.
"Our preparation has contemplated
a period of suprin ebattle intensity
from the third week of February, in
stead of from the third week of March,
so we are at present from one to
three wseks to the good.
"In fact barring unforseen circum
stances, our supply of munitions will
enable us to carry on a battle at the
supreme pitch of intensity until winter
without compromising our require
ments for 1919. This is despite the
fact that a hundred thousand men
were taken from the munition fac
tories for service in the army.
Make Many Planes
"We are makine in a Rinelp turwk
more airplanes than we made in the!
whole of 1914; in a single month moret
than we made in the whole of 1915;
in thres month's more than we made
in the whole of 191C. And we are go
ing to make this year several times
what we made last year."
Referring to the Gorman war minis
ter's claim to the capture of more
than twice the number of guns than he
had announced, Mr. Churchill said the
Gennan claim was a grotesque exag
geration and untrue.

district .
Douglas, likewise, will ct'lebrato the
passing of the allotec amount assigned
that city in the drive to cover the
county with Liberty bonds. A gigantic
parade in which troops stationed at
Camp Harry J. Jones, citizens and
visitors will Join, will feature the dem
onstration, while the honor flag will
be carried at the head of the pro
cession by a woman dressed in the
national cjulors nd mounted on a
white horse.
Tombstone will celebrate oversub
scription of its quota by raising an
honor flag at the intersection of the
two main streets, where a special pole
has been placed for the banner. The
allotment of $12,000 assigned the
county seat has been more than
trebled, reports last night stated. Spe
cial program has been arranged for
the celebration.
Pearce, one of the smallest com
munities in the county, but one ot
the most patriotic, also will raise an
honor flag. The first to go over the
top in this campaign, deprived ot1
many of its residents by the closing
down of its one industry, the llttl?
mining camp of former days, has over
subscribed by almost double the
amount alloted to it. A. Y. Smith and
Mrs. Smith will have charge of the
Pearce celebration.
Disttrict Wants Million
And now the Warren District is
aiming at $1,000,000 before it will be
satisfied with the hand it is lending
the government. With the close of
figures last night the total subscrip
tions had amounted to $912,600. The
quota assigned the district is $75i),n00.
Pledges to date are better than $162.
0ii(l more than the government re
quested as a minimum. But thers was
no maximum named, and the govern
ment has asked for all oversubscrip
tions possible to attain. For this rea
son those in charge of the district's
sales will not be satisfied until they
have boosted their total to at least
the million nv-.rk.
In the county, the government had
assigned as a maximum to be sold
$1,300,000. Already, with totals from
only Bisbee, Douglas and one or two
snail districts reported, this figure
has been exceeded by more than
$350,000, and the total has mounted
to $1,685,350.
Worth While Celebration
So the district has something really
worthy of the celebration which has
been planned for today. While it is
a local celebration insofar as it ap
plies tD thos taking part it is a
country-wide demonstration and jol
lification over success in its deeper
and real significance.
The district's holiday and celebra
tion will begin with the noon hour,
when work will be cast aside for the
day in business houses and offices and
everyone will prepare to take a part
in the patriotic prosrams which have
been prepared and which will con
tinue throughout the afternoon. For
the benefit of miners, the program has
been made into two destinctive and
separate programs. The one will occur
during the first hours of the afternoon,
an1 it is for the special benefit of
men on the nicht shifts. The second
will begin during the closing hours
of the afternoon, and will draw into
it3 nets the men of the day shirts.
Kvery resident of the district will be
expected to take his or her part in
making the occasion a success.
The first part of the afternoon's
celebration will begin at 1 o'clock
when a parade in which a company
of the 35th infantry, boy scouts, camp
fire girls, children from the LoreHa,
fixy schools and high; schools, the
mayor and city officials and citizens
will participate, will form at the Doyle
House and march to the city plaza.
At the plaza, beginning at 2 o'clock
the first program will be staged and
music and addresses will announce the
success of the district in its patri
otic task.
The second half of the afternoon's
demonstration will open at 4:30
o'clock when another parade in which
every automobile in the district is
expected to join, will form. This pro
cession, with the honking a", horns
and the blare of music, will pass
through Bisbee. to Lowell and War
ren, and will then return to the His
bee city park, where another program
will be held.
Raise H"nor Flag
Music and addresses will be the at
tractions of the second program as
of the first, but an added bit of zest
will precede the patriotic expressions
of Dr. R. 15. Von KleinSmid, president
of the University of Arizona. wh"3:i
J. X. Gaines, chairman of the Liberty
loan committee will hoist to the top
of the park flagpole, the Warren Dis
trict's honor flag.
Business houses yesterday were dis
playing the legend that they will i lns
their doors this afternoon for the cele
bration. Among the first to make an
nouncement of the recognition of th"
holiday were the banks of Bisbee u:i:l
I owp!1. l.nfr shops and st )rcs t"
every description hung cards in their
windows indicating that thy will
assist in making the day a success
and in booming out to the world the
fact that this district has done it
share and then added another ::va-'
out of pure patriotism. Bisbee. Low
ell and Warren will quit business .a!
join in the glad demonstration ovc
successful culmination of another war
task.

AMIENS OBJECTIVE
OF HUN ASSAULTS
MADE ON HANGARD
(Continued from Fags One)
and sundown still found the combat
'i,nts -U do:'. grips. There were
i slight fluctations of the line here as
I well as at other points, but there were
j no seirous retirements. Ths French
artillery constantly poured shells al
mast point blank into the German inv
iantry, which, however, appeared to
have adopted extended formation dur
ing the attack.
The enemy infantry battalions now
are coming into the fight with the
lightest possible equipment. The ma
jority of the men do not even cany
hand grenades.
Whether these attacks will develop
into a resumption of the general of
fensive cannot yet be definitely fore
cast; but it saenis probable that the
Germans are pursuing their ustfal prac
tices of pushing at various points in
the line until they find one which
seems weaker than the others. Then
they throw themselves .forward with
all their available strength at that
point with the hope of breaking
through.
GERMANS REPULSED
PARIS, April 25. The war office to
night says:
"There was great activity on the
part of both artilleries today in the reg
ion of Hangard and on both banks of
the Avii?, but no infantry action.
"In the Woevre, after a violent bom
bardment, the Germans delivered an
attack in the Regniville sector. Our
troops ejected the enemy from some
advance elements where he had gained
a footing and completely re-established
our lines. Prisoners remained in our
hands.
SAMMIES SHOW BRAVERY
WITH THE AMERICAX ARMY IN
FRAXCS, April 25 (By the Associated
Press). Further details received at
headquarters of the engagement
around Seichepney show that the
American troops were outnumbered, in
some instances, eight to one.
More ol the American wounded were
found today, one of whom was buried
alive for three days and had been
trampled over by the enemy when he
had crawled to the surface, in the be
lief that he was dead. The American
casualties are considerably less than
the first estimates.
S o'clock. Motion picture houses read
ily agreed to accept the mayor's proc
lamation and to dispense with 'their
regular matinee programs, and it is
the hope of the mayor and ctiy offi
cials that other amusement places wi'l
follow this patriotic lead. '
Especial emphasis is laid by com
mittees In charge of the celebration
of ther differentiation of the two pa
rades. In other words, they w;sh to
impress on everyone that the first ra

that the line of march will be short

The old-time mixture of Sage Tea

it to keep their hair a good, even color,
which is quite sensible, as we are liv
ing in an tge when a youthful appear
ance is of the greatest advantage.
Nowadays, though, we don't have
the troublesome task of gathering the
sage and the muisy mixing at home.
All dfug stores; cell the ready-to-use
product, improved by the addition ot
other ingredients, called "Wyeth's
Sage and Sulphur Compound." It is
very popular becnuse nobody can dis
cover it has been applied. Simply
moisten your couin or a soft brush
with it and draw this through your
hair, taking one small strand at a
time; by morning the gray hair dis
appears, but wnat delights the ladies
with Wyeth's S-ig and Sulphur Com
pound is that, besides beautifully dark
ening the hair after a few applications,
it also produces that soft lustre and
appearance of abundance which is so
attractive. This ready-to-use prepara
tion is a delightful toilet requisite for
those who deslro a more youthful ap
pearance. It is net intended for the

LIBERTY BOND
HELPING HALT HUN -HORDES
,Two mora units were added to the
district's 100 per cent division in the
Third Liberty loan compaign yester
day afternoon when committeps in
charge of the sales made tliPir reports
to J. X. Gaines, chairman. The day
shift of the White Tail Deer mine
registered perfect The night shift at
the same plant came within one of reg
istering the same record, and this one
must be discounted because of his
heavy purchase of the second Liberty
Issue. Hillman's carpenter shop made
the second unit to go "over the top"
when every employe in the establish
ment bought one or more bonds. The
records are among the best in the
district. Committees in charge of the
drive yesterday, following much work
in the mines, reported last night that
indications now are that today will be
the record breaking 24 hours of the
drive to date. They believe that when
tonight comes more personal subscrip
tions will have been registered than
on any one single day since the drive
was inaugurated and more residents
of the district will have become bond
owners than have ever before been
obtained in one day's work. While the
total of sales may not be as large as
for some days, they declare, the
amount of work accomplished will be
gigantic
Yesterday's results, as on the pre
vious davs of the drive, were excellent.
Especially among the committees
working ih the mines and shops were
Iiieh sales obtained, and when the evening-

ENTERS RED CROSS
SERVICE OVERSEAS
Seth E. Hazzard, formerly of War
ren and this county, where he ' was
engaged in the practice of law, has
given up his practice in San Diego
and enlisted for Red Cross service
overseas, according to news received
by Warren District friends. Mr. Haz
zard was formerly engaged in the
practice of law in Tucson before com
ing to the Warren District and was in
partnership with Frank H. Hereford.
He came' to Bisbee at the time that the
Warren townsite and other companies
were formed and was the principal at
torney for those organizations.
Several weeks ago, when the bureau
of personnel of the American Red
Cross asked for a volunteer from San
Diego, who would be willing to go to
Europe without compensation and at
his own expense, to engage in Red
Cross work. Mr. Hazzard volunteered
and his offer to go was accepted at
once. He will ro to Washington to
report and receive instructions and
leave immediately for France. As he
spaeks both French and Italian fluent
ly, Mr. Hazzard may be sent either to
the Italian or the French front.
Mr. Hazzard, who has practically
retired from the practice of law, has
been active in Red Cross work at San
Diego, being vice president of the
chapter there and a member of the
executive committee of the chapter.

REGISTRATION FOR
COUNTY VOTERS
The great register of Cochise conn
ty, for the registration of voters of
the county preliminary to the fall elec
tion, will be opened on Monday, May
6th. according to an announcement
made by County Recorder Krebs yes
terday while he was in this city. The
supplies for the registration includ
ing the great register and the various
precinct registers have been received
at the office of the .Recorder in Tomb
stone. All of the registration blanks
have not arrived but are expected to
be on hand before that date.
The law- Is conflicting, stating at
one place that the registration books
must be opened on May 1 and at an
other on the first Monday in May.
The recorder believes that it is safe
to take May 6 as the date, as other
wise there might be some question
as to the validity of the registration
of those who registered prior to the
first Monday in May
nstlces of the neace are 'ex-offlclo

The calling of such men as Schwab, the
steel magnate; Ford, the automobile mag
nate, and Ryan, the copper magnate, to
high and responsible pcsitions in the gov
ernment war program is a fine sign of the
times. Ryan, called just the other day, to
speed up the airplane program, has always
been a political enemy of the president,
but that makes no difference now. Ryan s
business genius and forceful ability are
needed to change failure into avital sector
of our offense to success. Schwab had al
ready been drafted to handle the shipping
problem, and Ford to speed the building
of submarine chasers. Thus the politician
has called upon the business man to help in '
the colossal tasks imposed by a world war.
This is as it should be. No nation can suc
cessfully prosecute war today unless all her
great men be called to help direct affairs.
In England they had to summon Lloyd
George, the Welsh peasant. In France
Clemenceau was drafted. And beside.3
these two great ones, scores of strong and
forceful men from every rank of civil life
have forged to the front in the direction of
affairs in the allied nations. The stress of
war is a furnace that burns the dross and
leaves only men cf real metal to survive.
Our airplane program is now our single
and greatest weakness. It has been mis
managed from the start, and bungled and
delayed. Too much and too optimistic pub
licity at the start hurt it worse than any
thing else. Twenty thousand planes were
promised to Europe by April and about
four were sent. With proper management
and the uttermost of efficiency at least two
thousand could have been sent.' Consider
what two thousand American planes would
have meant during the big German drive.
We have been a year at war and our big
men are coming to the front. Allied unity
and supreme effort are now reaching a
point where real results will be attained.
Germany must win right now or lose every
thing. '
"Gen. Foch is satisfied," is the report
from France, coming by cable direct from
the chief commander's lips as a quotation.
This is the best news so far from a battle-
field frcm which most of the news the past
month has been bad. If poch is satisfied,
then all friends of the allied cauie ought to
be, no matter how dark it is before the
dawn. It is declared by French officers
upon Foch's staff that the allies have the
Germans right where they want them, far
extended into a deep and dangerous salient
that they won at too great cost. They must
advance or retreat. They cannot stand
still. They are being punished daily in a
fightful manner by allied artillery. They
are striking desperately at all sides to widen
their salient. Every day the allied lines,
against them grow stronger. Every day
lessens their ultimate chance of success.
They MUST drive oh at any cost, and as
they pres3 forward the allied line bends
back, first taking its prescribed toll of
human flesh and blood. And still the al
lies successfully continue this unequal bat
tle without drawing upon the great strate
gic reserve. When the time comes Foch
will strike; be sure of that. It may not come
until late fall, but it will come, and it is as
sured that American soldiers by the tens of
thousands will help form the hammer head
when the blow falls. The longer it ie post
poned the more Americans will be in at the
finish.
It is a most encouraging sign when
union labor generally throughout the otate
refuses to be stampeded by a wild radical
who happens to be in authority. Union
labor is pledged to win this war. It has
made certain agreements with the govern
ment; it has made concessions and exacted
concessions. Then it is inherently patriotic.
Time was, and not long ago, when a call
to strike in Arizona; any call; and upon
any pretext, wa.4 generally heard and heed
ed, no matter if spoken in a whieper. But
that time has passed. Thoughtful and far
seeing men, both among employers and in
union labor ranks, realized it. But to a man
of the Croaff stamp the signs of the times,
when they point to progress, are as a closed
book. Again, uni,on labor leaders through
out the country, chief of whom is President
Gompers, did not hesitate to speak out
straight and plain regarding this ill timed
strike order. Union labor in Arizona has
been very unfortunate in its state leader,
both as regards Croaff and his predecessor.
There is strong hope that a more careful
and considerate choice will be made next
time.
Here is a tale of the fighting in Flan
ders as fine as any from Homer's Illiad or
Macauley's Lays of Ancient Rome: When
the French troops in hprizon blue came
swinging up to the aid of the hard pressed
British last week in the Mt. Kemmel serf
tor, the first word they heard was about a
garrison upon one of the slopes of that
dreadful hill that had been entirely sur
rounded by the Huns and yet was holding
out at last reports from raiders in the en
emy lines. Without stopping to rest,
French division swept down the hill to res
cue this gallant garrison. Pretty soon the
French heroes came back, bringing many
prisoners and war gear and their wounded.
They had found the garrison, alright, an
English subaltern and ten Tommies of a
Lancashire regiment, every man of them
dead at his post and a ring of fifty German
slain around them. - And this was the way ,
the British held the lines in Flanders during
all that terrible German onslaught. Four
for one they took in toll of death on Kem
mel hill and gladly paid their own price.
Alas and alack that this should be true :
Miss Rankin, the first and only woman
member cf congress, has made a complete
fizzle in her public career, and has probably
done more to hurt the cause of suffrage,
she the suffrage champion, than any score
of men or women in the world. Her ill
balanced mined went off on a tangent on
most public questions of importance. She
opposed the war. She has consorted with
pacifists. She has championed the I. W.
W. Ar.d now," when she wishes to make
a campaign in her home state, she is re
fused a hall and denied an audience. How
ever, all suffrage leaders are not of this
stamp or type. Big, broad, able women
are taking part in public affairs everywhere
and making good. This Rankin woman is
just one of the misfits that spring up every
where and at all times in all public movements.
Today is Liberty Day in America. Let
us write it down in characters as large a3
those that the immortal John Hancock
sprawled across the bottcm of the golden,
gleaming page of the declaration of inde
pendence. "If we do not hang together
we will all hang separately," was Ben
Franklin's dauntless witticism to a timor
ous signer of the same document. Yes,
and if we do not fight with all cur soul and
strength with our allies, in time we will
fight separately with the German foe. Let
us keep this fact aKvays before us in our
supreme efforts to speed up our govern
ment's war program right now.
The Government has started actual
work cn the largest powder plant in the
world at a point in the South, selected espe
cially with reference to raw materials. The
plant when completed will cover five and
one-half square miles, have a daily output
of 1 ,000,000 pounds of powder, employ
25,000 men and when finished will have
cost the Government $75,000,000, plus $1
profit to the E. I. Dupont de Nemour Com
pany, of Wilmington, Del., which ha3
taken the contract to build the plant and
have it in operation by June 1 .
Stocks and securities of all the allied
nations have remained remarkably firm
considering the power and gains of the Ger
man offensive, A New York banker ex
plains this inherent strength and at ths
same time pays high tribute to the charac
ter of the allied peoples, civilians, soldiers
and workers, as follows: "Certain it is that
optimism is universal among the inner fi
nancial circles, who get no little inspiration
from the magnificent courage of those at
the front as well as from those who quietly
suffer and endure at home." .
No bonfires in Berlin as yet over the
Huns' ravaging of Northern France. Too
many fathers and sons and brothers left
moldering amid the craters. What has Ger
many gained from the frightful invest
ment ?
ARIZONA HARD HIT
BY DRAFT LAW
i
1'(!c.t congress enacts a law chang
ing the method of draft, all of the
Class 1 men of Arizona will be ex
hausted before the summer passes.
This rnans that men with lower class
ifications will be called from this stats
in order to meet th state's quota
under the system now being used.
Other states expect never to be
called upon to go out of Class 1 to
fill their qitas. Under the draft sys
tem now in effect some of the rr.'3n to
go this month from Arizona will have
to be taken from classifications other
than class 1. Long before completion
of the heavy movement of troops this
summer, which announcement from
Washington, says is to be expected.
Class 1 in Arizona will have been ex
hausted. A 1 mad j- Pinal county's local board
has notified the adjutant general that
there are not sufifcient men in Class
1 to meet the present call on the coun
ty for 65 ir.rsn to be supplied from there
in the two movements that have al
ready been ordered. There are only
33 men Available in Class 1 in Pinal
county, leaving a shortage of 32, which
will have to be made up from other
classifications.
When the next call comes it is ex
pected that other counties will show a
shortage. Thsre are now 3197 men
in Class 1 in the 14 counties of the
state. The quota for Arizona last year
was 4478 and according to press re
ports from Washington the draft this
year is exacted to equal, if not exceed
last year.
According to records of the draft
and voluntary enlistments, Arizona
last year sent more than 7000 men into
the army and navy. With proper cred
its, it is thought that Arizona should
not be called upon to furnish any more
men this year.
Col. Harris, adjutant general. Is pre
paring a table setting forth the act
ual condition in Arizona, which will be
forwarded to tbrs provost marshal gen
eral, which he hopes to have given
consideration in the making of calls
under future drafts.

SUCCESS CLAIMED
(Siiocial to The Review)
LONDON, April 25. The Associat
ed Press clarns from a high naval
source that, the opertaions at Zee
bruggee were a complete success with
the result that the Flanders flotilla
now will be obliged to resort to the
Ostend route In putting to sea, from
which the British forces can more
easily handle the German ships. In
addition to the damage done to the
mole and the German guns, material
and shipping, the channel has been
blocked by the cement ships and a
German dredger was destroyed. The
loss cf 4he dredeer,. together5 with
the blocking up of the channel must
result in the speedy silting up of the
waterway, and it will take at least
several weeks to clear the passage.
But for a change in the wind which
cleared away the smoke bank and
revealed the presence of the British
ships the' casualties would have been
much smaller and the operations at
Ostend probably would have proved
as successful as those at Zeebruggee.
MONSTER TANKS
IN DEATH GRIPS
DURING BATTLE
(Continued from Page One)
The latest Liberty Loan
"Bonds or bondage."
.slogan is,
hand fighting ensued, the bayonet be
ing used freely. Six hundred prison
ers were taken here alone and a great
number of the enemy were killed. The
town was virtually cleared, and to
day only a few scattered pockets of
Germans are in the place.
Oramtic Tank Duel
In the Boise D' Aqutnne, just west
cf Villers-Bretonncux one German of
ficefc and forty men surerndered to
day. In a counter attack a largi part of
the old British positions about Villers
Bretonneux were regained. Today
these Germans who still, remained in
the bottle could not gat out, and their
comrades were unable to get in
through the narrow neck to assist
them.
Durin yesterday's fihting the Ger
mans at one time got as far as Cachy,
.southwest of Vlllers-Bretonneux, and
this represented their greatest ad
vance. The tanks furnished the most
dramatic chapter of the story of yes
terday's battle. . Thrjae tanks, which
the eGrtuans employed fur the first
time were bulky affairs, with heavy
armor und guns. The British tanks,
which were thrown into the action off
set th" Gciman monsters furnished the
first tank engagement in history. The
main blush between the tanks came
when the German engines attacked

be expected, one of the British lna
cbines was demolished. The other
was being hard pressed by four or
five of the big "enemy tanks, when one
of the larger British tanks, which had
observed the fray from the distance
came rushing up and engaged the Ger
mans. Great Battle Royal
It was a royal battle. The tanks'
guns blazed furiously and shells crash-1
ed Irom the steel armor in every di
rection. The British tank finally got,
several shots home on one of the Ger
.nans and put It out of action. This
disconcerted the others and they fled,
leaving the Pritish tank with its small-
jT comrade in possession of the field.
Some of the uiost t'.lluig work was
done by the tanks near Cresy. Here
numbers of small, fast BritiHh tanks
attacked a large conceal ration of en-;
einv infantry. Before the Germans
were able to escape, the swiftly uiov-i

planting. Prices closed firm at the

1508. Oats declined A to lVs net. In
provisions the outcome was uncnanged
to 20 lower.
Bears had something of an advant
age to start with in the corn market,
owing chiefly to the apparent prospect
that seasonable temperatures woiuu
remedy the unfavorable conditions
which have of late been more or lest,
hindering field work. Later, however,
announcement that no extended period
of desirable temperature was in sight
gave the crop outlook a less auspicious
aspect, and made values take a pro
nounced upward slant.
Oats were under much selling pres-
. sure, despite liberal buying on the

Provisions responded slowly to the
higher quotations on hogs.

HOW TO AVOID
BACKACHE AND
NERVOUSNESS
Told by Mrs. Lynch From
Own Experience.
Providence, R. I. "I was all run
down in health, was nervous, had head-
aches, my back
ached all the time.
I was tired and had
no ambition for any
thing. 1 bad taken
a number of medi
cines which did me
no good. One day
I read about Lydia
E. Pinkham's Vege
table Compound and
what it had done for
womn, so I tried
it. My nervousness
and backache and
headaches disappeared. I gained in
weight and feel fine, so I can honestly
recommend Lydia E. Pinkham's Vege
table Compound to any woman who is
puffering as I was." Mrs. ADELINE B.
Lynch, 100 Plain St. Providence, R. I.
Backache and nervousness are symp
toms or nature's warnings, which in-'
dicate a functional disturbance or an
unhealthy condition which often devel- j
ops into a more serious ailment.
Women in this condition should not
continue to drag along without help, but
profit by Mrs. Lynch a experience, and
try this famous root and herb remedy,

Deke Leurandt, should the pepper'
backstop artist become injured, and
another pitennr, the Queen club will
look at least as strong as the other
two nines in the league.
Bill Leverett will pitch Sunday's

For
HALL this little girl grow up in the sort
of American home we know, healthy and .
happv? Shall she have the advantage of
living and learning in a free land, under free in
stitutions ? Shall such children develop into the
Liberty-loving citizens that a free America may ,
be proud of?
For over two hundred, years Americans have
fought valiantly, and died gallantly, to win for
' thernselves and hand down to their posterity the
blessings of liberty, justice, self-government and
equal opportunity. This precious heritage, bought
at so great a price, is now threatened.
The question which today confronts America
as a nation, and you as an individual, is
whether or not a free America
is worth fighting for
Are American children in this and all future
generations to' receive unimpaired the legacy of
freedom of which we are now the custodians, or
shall their country be turned over bodily to the
brutal, rapacious, power-mad enemy which has
forced us into this war?
This question cannot be answered by word of
mouth, but by deeds alone.

ent site o the camp to withfn a short
distance of Tombstone. Considerable
grading has also been done and some
surfacing will be started soon. It is
hoped that a part of the road beyond
the camp toward the hill can be

hill just this side of Tombstone can

make repairs on the road sufficient to
allow his trucks hauling supplies to go

he can make it so that it can bs used
