ADVISES THE
U. S. CONTROL
OF SUGAR IN
THIS COUNTRY
Food Administrator Asks Leg-j
Ulation Enabling Govern-;
ment to Buy And Sell Sugar j
to American Consumers.. j
i
WASHINGTON. Jan. 2. Govern
ment purchase and sale to consumers
oi all sugar u.-4 d in the l ulled States
and control of the amounts and kinds
of foud to be .reived in public eating
places were advocated to meet the ao
noicial war conditions by Food Ad
ministrator Hoover today in testimony
bttore the seuate comniitiee iuvet.(i
gating sugar, tie said autiitioual leg
islation conferring upon the toed ad
ministration sucii powers should be
enacted by contcre:.
In urging government purchase ot
sugar Mr. Hoover explained to the
committee that through thai method
alone c juid refiners be paid equitable
price. Ke said some Dt-et factories
are making huge profits at 7.5 cents
a pound agreed upon tor beet sugar,
but on the other hand, a factory in
Michigan and "one or two" in Colora
do actuary are losing money at that
price. His plan, he said is for tne
government to purchase from beet
factories at different prices, based on
the cost of production, buy cane
sugars at prices on the sine basis,
pool tha entire lot and sell to the
consumer at one pirce.
Food Conservation
Food conservation came up only
casually during an all-day examination
of Mr. Hoover, but the administrator
revealed that results from conserva
tion plans formulated for hotels and
restaurants hod been disappointing
because of the deliberate failure of
some to co-operate with the adminis
tration. Those seeking to help hai
been forced to abandon their efforts,
Mr. Hoover said, in order to meet
competition. The witness believed
housewives geriVrrJly were confcrui
i:ig to the conservation reeommencla.
Uuns. Chairman Reed of the committee,
who has been the chief critic of the
food administration in the senate did
not question Mr. Hoover Senator
Lodge conducting the examination
most of the day.
Reed and Hoover Clash
Late in the session, however. Sena
tor Reed and Mr. Hoover engaged in
rather a heated discussion when the
witness asked to have admitted to the
committee records the statement on
sugar situation which Mr. Hoover
sought to submit bofore the holidays
and which later was made public at
the White House.
Chairman Reed said be wanted to
examine the statement over night and
that the question of admitting it to
the records would be determined
later. He added that he wanted to
question the witness further on it. Mr.
Hoover fianlly declared with an ap
parent show of beat that he did not
'"care whether it was introduced or
not."
1918 Supply Short
Mr. Hoover said the sugar supply
for next year promised to be three
hundred thousand tons short ot the
estimated demand, but it was hoped to
solve the shortage by conservation
and limitation of supply to manufac
turers of non-essential foodstuffs.
While he thought it might be neces
sary to limit the per capita consump
tion to three pounds a month, the wit
ness said be did not consider the
principle of limitation of personal con
sumption sound because it tended to
cause discontent among the people.
The administrator explained his de
sire to have the fod administration's
view of the sugar situation presented
early in the investigation by saying
that testimony before the committee

j Pool Fight.ng Resources
This was one of the great decisions
reached at the conferences through
: which tbe co-belligerents planned to
pool their righting resources and
move as a unit toward driving tbe
; Germans and their allies out of coa
1 quered territory and crushing the Tau
tonic world domination scheme. The re
I is to be co-ordinated etfort not only
i in fighting on land and sea but in pro
duclicn at home and in the vast shlp-
I' buildtng projects upon which depend
tbe vital problems of maintaining un
, interrupted transportation in spite ot
i submai ines.
Even before Colonel House and his
t associates on the American mission
reached name, the machinery to speed
up war preparations here had been
set in motion.
"Speed Up" Is Cry
In today's announcement is seen the
xeulanation of tbe re-organization ot
war department control embraced In
the formation of tbe new war ronncil
of general officers, of renewed efforts
to speed up the shipping board's mer
chant building program, and possibly
of the decision of the administration to
take over all the nation's railroads
wtihout waiting for action by con
rgess. Other indications or the new
pressure are manifest but cannot be
discussed publicly for military era
sons. It can be stated authoritatively,
however, that definite steps to make
good the pledge to allied leaders by
Colonel House already have been
taken.
Entire Unitey
The first recommendation of the
mission is for "entire military, naval
and economic" unity of action be-
! tween the powers opposed to i.er
Imany. That is regarded as having
I bee naccomplished.
The summary of the military con
ferences attended by General Bliss
shows that an agreement to "pool re
sources for the mutual advantage of
all" was entered into. There follows
thiqs significant statement:
"The contribution ot the United
States to this pooling agreement was
agreed upon. The contributions live
wise of the countries associated with
the United States were determined.
This pooling arrangement guaranteed
that full equipment of every kind
would be available to all American
rtoops sent to Europe during the year
1918."
I-nnklntr bevond 1918. the United
States will have no need to seek nii'i-
itary equipment of any kind away
from home. Before the present year
! ends its full war resources will have
been made available.
Another Recommendation
The third recommendation of tbe j
mission to which the country is com-1
mitted is for extension of the Ameri- j
can shipping program. "Systematic ,
co-ordination of resources ot men and !
materials." to produce the necessary j
ships Is urged upon the government j
and people alike.
Under a resolution adopted by the j
interallied conference, a unified ue '
of ship tonnage was agreed upon
whic would permit "the liberating of
the greatest amount of tonnage pos
sible for the transport at ion ot Amer-.
lean troops." A policy to govern the

food bill in which he was quoted as
saying price fixing had been a failure
in Enpland. The witness explained
that when he fo testified England did
not control coraaiodtties on which it
attempted to fix prices. He argued
iha' price fixing of government ccn

Mr Hoover maintained that the

Thursday Morning, January 3, 1918.
And the third day comes a frost, a killing frost, and
nips his root, and then he falls from the high seat of
all so. not an. surely but most of his New Tear's
resolutions. ,
In a letter received recently by Sheriff Harry Wheeler
from Mai John Greenway. master of the C and A. mines,
now with the American army in France, the major de
clares that "we have one big job ahead of us, and it will
take all the brains and power we have to turn the trick."
Continuing further the major says, commenting upon the
Russian collapse and its retarding influence upon allied
success: T wish that Kerensky. in dealing with the L
W. W. of Russia, had had your couraee and decision; if
he had we would have been cleaning up the loose ends
now." Coming from a man of John Greenway's charac
ter and experience, this tribute to the Cochise sheriff i
about as high as can be paid to any man.
Along with the observance of Christmas, the kaiser
always has his little peace plans ready to push upon the
rest of the world. "The kaiser, having wrecked part of
Europe and stolen a considerable portion, is most eager
for peace. And a few foolish or thoughtless or mis
guided or shortsighted ptcple in each of the allied nations
want heed paid to the bait he dangles. Wise and worth
while allied statesmen will at this time pay not the
slightest heed to this spider's -web that is spread to en
gulf their peoples, but will bravely and calmly and
steadfastly brush aside tnd bend every energy to crush
ing the Hun.
When newspaper publishers cut their advertising
rates and job printing prices below the actual cost ol
production in a scramble for county work they also cut
their own throats. They dissipate the value of their own
space and their own work and yet stUl expect the general
public to value these things highly. The Review editor
witnessed such a thing st the Cochise county seat yes
terday, and. while he frankly admits that he is sorry not
to have secured the county printing, yet he is more sorry
still to see brother editors count this printing above
pride in their profession and its real worth. The Review
has always managed to get along without the county
pie and will continue to do so until it can secure that work
at the same fair and average prices that it charges the
Bisbee merchants for advertising and job work.
"We must achieve the purpose for which the entente
U fighting." declared Lloyd-George in answer to the re
quest of the labor element of England that he state
British war aims after the German peace proposals to
the misguided Russian slaves. And in this sentence is
found the salvation of world democracy of today. The
wizard Welshman with the magic tongue and gifts of
penetrant understanding sees right through every move
of German diplomacy and has an answer to every Ger
man subtlety that cuts like a bright blade. The gravest
peril of the allied cause lies in the nest two months of
winter while the German baronet is rove red by snow
and the Germaa tongue and pen and agent and gold are
all moved to the- uttermost from the renter of the web at
Berlin to bluff or trick a peace that will amount to
practical victory before the American giant eaters the
lists fully armed.
THE WAR ITS LOSSES AND GAINS
Henry Clews, the New York banker. alays optimistic,
writes as follows on the war:
"Over 5fl.000.0HI men are under arms In Europe,
whose energies have been turned from production to
destruction. O ft H.OOO.OftO men have been killed or
permanently injured since the war began, the killed
alone numbering over 7.000.00. Over Slod.OOM.ooo.
00 have already been eipnded by the nations at war.
and at present rate of rising expenditure the cobt will
exceed llSO.fK'On.aoft.oon when tlie end of the fourth year
is reached next August.
"When it is remembered that for every roan at the
front from three to live arc required at the rear for
his support, it follows that between 1j0.Hvj.oo and
;?w.'Kfl.t mn have b"cn withdrawn from fie norma'
channels or production Into the alwrm!- No wonder
that the ar!d is facin; a teriouj eouomic famine, not
only in food and clothing, but also in the Innumerable
rrateriala required for human comfort and support. The
lrss in life and money only partly measures the colossal
till for damages, which will be-a crushing burden for
generations. Such a bill must also include the setback
to moral and spiritual forces, the inheritance of bitter
ness, the detrimental effects upon art. literature, science,
education and all the varied and social and political
activities which are part of our civilization. These are
losses that wOl leave their impress npon the nations
for many future decades. The material losses such as
destruction of factories, railroads, ships, cities, etc
though less important than those just mentioned, are
risible and more readily offset by new energies and
resources that will promptly develop with the advent
of peace.
"The huge cost of this war can be appreciated when
it is considered that the six great wars preceding the
Russo-Japanese, the Boer, the Franco-Prussian, the
American Civil War. the- Crimean and the Napoleonic
wan cost about S23.000.000.000, as against J150.000.000.
000. the estimate of this war up to next August. Great
Britain will then hare spent $24,000,000,000. including
$6,000,000,000 in loans to allies, and good authorities
estimate that in these three years the warring powers
will hare quadrupled their debts, the interest on which
already amounts to 15.000.000.000. It would seem as if
such hardens would break the back of any nation, yet
the tremendous development of resources, and the great
potential recuperative powers of the various nations
afford good basis tor the belief that recovery will be
more rapid than expected. .This country will recover
with a bound when peace cornea, and the gain from our
exports and newly opened markets will largely offset
present losses. Great Britain will certamly recuperate
rapidly, as she has always done after each war. Ger
many will make tremendous efforts at recovery, though
handicapped by impaired finances and the break up of
her foreign trade. She should not be hampered when
peace comes by retaliatory tariffs; they would only keep
jealousy alive and limit her purchasing powers from the
United States. France, too. win also show great re
siliency. .One of the most serious after-war problems
will be that of deflation; Germany. Russia and France
have trebled or quadrupled their issue of paper money.
England is the only leading nation in Europe redeeming
its obligations in gold."
SUSPENDERS
Government physicians and surgeons have, after ex
amination and care -of some million men selected under
the draft and thousands of others who have volunteered,
come to the conclusion that the wearing of tight belts
has been the cause of most of the stomach troubles and
appendicitis that afflict our people today. Thus does the
old-fashioned "gallus" or suspender come back into its
own with a triumphant bend and wave after spending
fifteen years npon the shelf of time. Listen to the words
of these wise physicians and healers who speak from the
vantage point of wide experience and governmental
authority:
Tnta we were forced to examine hundreds of thou
sands of men." he said. "I never took the question seri
ously of whether it was better to wear belt or suspenders.
Now, I know that this is a very vital question and that the
innocent belt is responsible for many of the abdominal
troubles so prevalent in this country.
"Start at the beginning. Fifteen years aeo you
hardly ever heard of appendicitis. Fifteen years ago
nearly 90 per cent of American men wore suspenders,
thus leaving their abdomens free and uneontracted. Then
came the fad of wearing belts and appendicitis operations
became more common. Before the advent of the belt
you seldom heard of stomach troubles, and when they
did happen they were usually the result of over-indulgence.'
Nowadays more men are wearing belts than wear
suspenders, and it is almost the exception to find a man
who has no trouble with his abdominal regions.
There is no excuse for using a belt to keep the trou
sers up and constrict the stomach. It is almost disloyal
to wear belts since cloth conservation as demanded by
the government calls for the elimination of cuffs about
the ankles. Smart men ali know that the best way to
make cuffless trousers look right is to hold them up with
suspenders. They avoid the "suspendered look' by wear
ing the under-the-shirt invisible kind which work in se
cret, as it were. Then everyone knows that shoulders
were given men to carry weight from. There are more
than :o.000.0o0 soldiers ir the field wbo carry practically
all their equipment on various kinds of surrenders, even
their cartridge belts being suspended from their
shoulders-
"Amerkan nt'n should drop the belt, fuspenders
win mean increased efficiency, better health and lonper
lres. and I expert to see them increase in ue. They
were good enough for our fathers, and now we know the
"old gentlemen" weren't so foolish as we thought."

FIVE THOUSAND
DESERTERS ARE
ON STATE LIST
Compilation of Slackers by
Colonel Breen Most Inter-
estine Reflection on the
Course of Mexicans.
PHOENIX, Jan. 2. Four thousand
nine hundred and five deserters have
been charged up to Arizona in secur
ing the first quota of this state for tht
national army from the date of tht
registration to the present time.
This compilation of slackers in Ari
zona has just been completed by Col
onel Fred S. Breen. the first one of the
kind ever made public, and givea souit
i:ea of the large number of regis
trants who have failed to appear foi
examination when so ordered by the
local boards.
This number of deserters is equiva
lent to $245 50 to the active m.a o:
men who turn them over to any of
ficer, as there is a price of J50 on the
hrad of each one of them, placed
there by the government.
How this number of deserters in
Arizona compares with the deserter1
of other states has not beeu learned.
o such table ever bavin-; been re
ceived at the local headquarters Bui
it is the opinion of tha local officials
that this state will stand near the
head of the list in the number of de
serters, principally on account of the
large number of Mexicans iu the pop
luation. Theer are also many of othet
foreign nationalities in the state,
with the majority of whom the dra!'.
officials have had much troiibK
In the table prepared, it is interest
ing to note that Cochise county stands
the highest in the number of deseit
eis. Cochise county is in the south
east corner of the state and has prob
ably the largest per cent of Mexicans
of any county in the state.
Gila county is second highest, and
r.ma third. Apache county has the
honor of owning the fewest deserters,
only 13 being charged to tha: county.
Navajo is not far behind, with orly
17.
Following is the table diowtns the
deserters in each county aiiJ the total

Of the entire num'r of 5.7-S reeis
trants reported from the various
counties as deserters. 823 have been
disposed of in some manner in the of-fi-w
of Col. Breen. Some have been
sent on to training ramp, having pro
duced sufficient excuse for not havine
reported at the first call of the local
board. Some have been dismissed a
aliens, and some have been sent to
orison, convicted as deserters. In all.
$23 have bjten apprehended and dis
posed of. leaving 4.905 still on the list
as deserters and for whom the covcm
icent has offered a reward of $30 each.
