Wanted: A volunteer convict.
The city police, the constable,

him. They all want a man who
will volunteer to serve a term in
the pen.
And all for the glory of convict

For the past two or three

Poker games and other gamb

hold-up artists. Waiting until
they have stalked a good, rich
game they seek opportunity to
surprise the players. Then they
swoop down suddenly on the table,
stick guns Uiider the noses of the
gamblers, scoop up the coin, and
disappear.
Players in the gambling games
dare not swear to complaints.
They would lay' themselves bare
to prosecution.
Officers cannot find heads or

the stick-ups are going on when
ever a game gets prosperous.
So, they want a volunteer con

"THE HUN WITHIN"
AT GRAND THEATER
Dorctby Gish. the charming D. W.
Griffith actress, has a splendid role in
The Hun Within," the superb new
special Paramount-Art era ft production
which will be displayed at the Grand
theater today.
Miss Gish plays the part of a pa
triotic American jrirl whose love affair
is interrupted by Hun spies who seek
to destroy American transports bound
for France with troops. She foils this
plot in an ingenious way. but not until
after ehe has had gruelling experi
ences, all of which are ca leu a ted to
keep the attention of the -audience at
high tension. ' The activities of United
States secret service operatives in
dealing with the Hun spy menace, 'are

showed anything but a spirit of recon

hare straightened out. Telegrams
have been sent to the Arizona delega

mediate investigation be made and
the result wired here.
The message to L. Dupen. who is
employed at the Phelps Dodge supply
house, from Adjutant General Harris
at Washington. D. C, said:
"We regret to inform you that
Eustace PerciTal Dupen private head

Mr. Dupen received a letter six
weeks ago from his younger son. An
thony, in which he mentioned the fact
that he was driving 'a motor truck.
On the o'Jher hand, at last advices

More Hopes Shattered
Hopes had been entertained, and were based on good grounds, that
this session of the Arizona legislature wo-ld conclude its sittings with
a record clear of petty political intrigue and dealings. These hopes
cam with the opening sessions, and as progressiTe measures have been
received and passed, have been daily strengthened.
Now tha senate proposes to shatter tie clean slate and replace it
a record of sruail dealings without example in the state.

Arizona's Health Record
Reports frcm the oflice of the provost marshal general continue to
add honors to Arizona. The last of the reports credits Arizona with the
highest health record among all states of the nation.
Less than te weeks ago a similar report placed Arizona in first
rank in the number of men per capita sent to the army and in prompt
ness in answering the draft calls.
Arizona" health record, however, is a matter in which the Btate
may take especial pride. Less men. per capita, were returned to .this
state for physical reasons after induction into the army, than to any
other state. This means that the average health of Arizona n 3 is above
the average elsewhere in the United States that Arizona's men are
clean, sound and physically fit.
Arizona has been advertised as a health resort, a state where cli
mate, air, and surroundings add to the life of, those whose health has
been impaired. Hundreds come to the state each year seeking a new
"lease on life."
Everyone knows of instances where men who came here a year
or two years ago broken in health, have entered the army, passed the
physical tests and lived the hard, rugged, working life of the soldier. To
Arizonaus this is a natural result of out-door life, a miracle enacted
before their eyes each day. To those outside the state it is unbelievable.
To lead the nation in per capita enrollment is one honor for the
state; to lead ia health is a greater honor. No more noble compli
ment could be paid the manhood of a commonwealth than to say "all are
physically fit."
Elevating Education
One 6tep in the right direction has been taken in the Arizona legis
lature. The house has approved passage of its bill No. 10. known as the
Peterson bill, and designated to take Arizona's schools out cf politics.
Under the bill the schools and politics would be comparatively di
vorced, the state superintendent would be abolished from elections, and
a commission of mixed party complexion would handle schools affairs.
Education would be placed on a plane above vote-getting.
School laws are among the mc3t important before the legislature at
this session. Two contending forces are striving to enact special meas
ures. The one would emancipate the schools. The other would hitch
them to the state superintendent. Educators ' favor the former. The
state superintendent and his coterie of followers lead the .fight fur
political retention.
Reform of the school laws is a progressive, necessary, measure. The
members of the house by their action in recommending the Peterson
bill show a decided step in the right direction, a tendency of Arizona
legislators to improve on the records of past legislative bodies.

"WASHINGTON. Feb. 7. Henry
Veeder, counsel for Swift & Co., testi
fied before the senate agriculture
committee today on cross-examination
by Francis J. Heney that friends of
the packers throughout the country
were solicited to bring influence to
bear on "members of congress to de
feat the Borland resolution providing
for an Investigation of the meat pack
ing industry.
Frequent verbal encounters between
Mr. Heney and Mr. Veeder marked the
testimony dealing with efforts of the
commission's investigators to search
the attorney' private vault for papers
and Mr. Heney charged that a guard
he had placed in Mr. Yeeder's oflice
was bribed with gifts o whisky- and
cigars. Mr. Veeder denied this. .
J. Spencer Smith, head of a 'New
York importing and commission firm,
was heard today by the house' inter
state commerce committee, whica
also is considering legislation to reg
ulate the meat industry- Mr. Smith
said that If transportation was avail
able to everyone on equal terms the
five leading meat packers would be
stripped of whatever power they
might possess and that they "could
not then possibly be a menace to the
Industry or to the country at large."
The transportation problem", be said,
was at the bottom of many ills.
