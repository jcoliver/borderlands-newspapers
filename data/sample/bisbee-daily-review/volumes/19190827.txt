'I' wish to ask every railroad

"The federal control act did not
contemplate that the government

In any way, are resting under an

LABOR OPPOSES
PLOTS OF REDS
A. F. L. Head, on Return From
Europe, Declines to Discuss
Local Problems, But Declares
Unions Repudiate Red Flag
NEW YORK. Auk. 26. Declining
to discuss current labor problems ia,
detail on the ground that he had noti
had time to familiarize himself with
them during his absence abroad,
amuei. uompers, president of the
American Federation of Labor, who
armed here from France on the
transport George Washington today,
said that he wished to make plain
that he "did not come home to Inter
fere with the program of labor but to
help my fellow laborers."
Mr. Gompera, who has been attend
ing the session of the International
trades union council at Amsterdam,
declared that "the employers of labor
have not yet learned that the time is
past when they are the complete
monarchs of all they survey."
"Certainly," he added "men and wo
men who work must have a voice In
determining conditions under which
they shall give their labors."
Declines Comment on Strikes.
Questioned by reporters, the labor
leader begged to be excused from
commenting on the president's state
ment on the merits of the railroad
shopmen's demands, the actors'
strike, the Plumn plan for the na
tionalization of railroads and the pro
posed workers' strike on the ground
that he had not time to study them.
He admitted, however, that urgent
telegrams from Washington, whose
source he would not divulge, prompt
ed him to hasten his return home
by at least a week.
Tonight Mr. Gompera Issued a
statement on the
progress of labor!
at the International Trades Union
Congress convention In which he said
that the congress "for the first time
approximated the democratic concep
tion of genuine internationalism."
"The new organization is already
something more than a mere frame
work," Mr. Gompers said. "It hag
already taken a firm and unmistake
able attitude on what is perhaps the
gravest' problem of this critical hour
is organized labor to be inveigled
into the revolutionary movements
that have been showing their heads
in every country of Europe as a re
Bult of the war?"
Says Organized Labor Antl-Sovlet
Alluding to the overwhelming de
feat by the congress of a resolution
calling for organized labors' support
of soviet revolutions, , Mr. Gompers
continued: i
"The defeat of this proposition
means the definite aad final repudia
tion by the organized labor of Eu
rope and America not only of Bol
shevism, but of the whole effort to
involve labor unions In international
revolutionary movements of any kind.
It Js true that the majority of the
delegates profess more or less so
cialistic doctrines, but they have
finally and definitely repudiated the
ceaseless efforts of the Socialist par
ties to utilize the unions for revolu
tionary cataclysm."

G. 0. P. WOULD DODGE
"ENTANGLING ALLIANCES"
Despite Multiplying Delays,
Wilson and Supporters Still
Are Confident Treaty to Be
Ratified Dduring September
WASHINGTON, Aug. 26. Provision
for American representation on ,a
score of international commissions to
carry out details of the peace settle
ment would be stricken out of the
peace treaty under a sweeping amend
ment adopted today by the senate for
eign relations committee.
Later in the senaie useir tne com
mittee's previous decision to amend
the Shantung section raised a whirl
wind of debate with Senator McCum
ber, North Dakota, bitterly attacking
the committee's course and Senator
Borah, Idaho, defending it. Both are
Republican members of the commit
tee. .
At the end of the day Senator Hitch
cock of Nebraska... the Democratic
leader, talked over the possibilities of
the situation with President Wilson at
the White House and predicted after
ward that all amendments would be
defeated eventually and that the trea
ty would .be ratified during September.
Committee Split on Party Lines
In its decision regarding American
participation in the reconstruction
commissions, the committo divided on
party lines, the nine Republicans pres
ent standing as a unit for the amend
ment and the seven. Democratic votes
all being recorded in the negative.
Senator McCumter, who voted with
the Democrats against the Shantung
amendment, was absent.
Although the committee's action
would change the language of the
treaty in more than 50 places, scat
tered, through many sections, an ex
ception was made of the reparations
commission which is to have charge
of the collection of Germany's Indem
nity bill. Senator Fall, Republican,
New Mexico, who presented the
amendment, said he had not proposed
taking the , American representative
from this commission because he felt
American interests' might be directly
involved in its work.
Sees "Entangling Alliances"
In the commissions which are af
fected by the amendment, Mr. Fall
said, American interests would be eo
indirect as not to compensate for the
dangers of becoming hopelessly in
volved in European affairs.
Among these commissions are the
bodies set up to rectify the bound
ary between Belgium and Germany ,to
establish the free city of Danzig, to
supervise numerous plebiscites and to
take care of various other details un
der the treaty.
The amendment alscr omits refer
ence to the commissions that are to
be appointed by the league of nations,
committee members saying that was a
subject to be dealt with after action
had been taken regarding the league
covenant itself.
Shantung "Poisoned Blade"
In his speech in the senate. Sena
tor McCumber declared the committee
majority really intended the Shan
tung amendment to drive a "poisoned
blade" into the treaty with the pur
pose of killing the league of nations.
He asserted that the change which
would give to China Instead of to
Japan the old "German rights in Shan
tung province, was actually a blow at
China because it could accomplish no
result but to drive Japan out of the
league, and leave her free to pursue
a course of spoiliation against Chi
nese territory.
Senator Borah replied that China
had nothing to hope for under tho
league because the same powers which
will control its decisions already had
decided her case in favor of Japan.
He reviewed the history of Japanese
diplomacy in the east and said all
the facts argued against Japan's keen
ing her promise to return Shantung to
.nina.
The president. Senator Hitchcock
said, seemed well pleased with the
senate situation and was confident the
treaty would bo ratified without anv
amendments or reservEtions that
would reopen negotiations.
BISBEE FACES FOOD RATIONING
AS RESULT OF LOS ANGELES RAIL
STRIKE; SUGAR SHORTAGE FIRST
Owing to a threatened famine,
due to the railroad strike, Bis
bee and the Warren district
again face sugar "rationing."
Tlfere is said to be a 30 days'
supply here and in Lowell, but in
order to prevent a shortage and
to thwart "hoarders," the Phelps
Dodge Mercantile company yes
terday announced It would here
after sell only two pounds to a
customer.
There is also a possibility of
a shortage in other supplies,
due to the strike, as the greater
proportion of fruits and vege
tables used in this district come
from California. There are rea
sonable stocks on hand, however.

WASHINGTON, Aug. 2C Entering

merce sub-committee today brought
forth testimony that a shortage of cars
and labor difficulties were hinderng
coal production, that certain elements
in the miners' union were Intent on
nationalization of the coal mines with
adoption of a six-hour day and a five
day week plus wage increase and that
unless problems of production were
solved the country would be brought

So emphatic were tha witnesses
that the railroads were at the bottom
of the present low production tnat
Senator Frelinghuysen, chairman of
the committee, indicated the commit
tee's intention of bringing Director
General Hines into the hearing.
Says Radical Miners in Control
After detailing the effects of labor
difficulties and alleged car shortage
on coal production, Harry N. Taylor,
president of tho National Coal asso
ciation, an .organization of operators.
declared a bill aad been prepared for
submission to congress providing for
the nationalization of the mines. He
added that, what the miners wanted
was not only that the government
should own the properties but that
the mines should be turned over to
them for operation. He insisted that
the more radical of the miners ap
peared to be gaining control in cer
tain districts and that there was a
serious danger that these elements
woul make an oanfest effort for the
Institution of something approaching
"soviet methods" in conducting the
properties.
Sees War Agreement Broken
Fear was expressed by Mr. Taylor
that at the miners' convention Sep
tember 9 in Cleveland and at the joint
conference of miners and operators
in Buffalo September 25, action might
be taken to funrer endanger produc
tion. He told tre committee that the
strikes In Illinois. Kansas and Mis
souri were 1j violation of the Wash
ington agreement which provided for
the continuous operation of the mines
until peace definitely Is established.
The conduct of the strikes In the mid
dle west, he said, were in many cases
Influenced by radical elements. He
said It was known generally In the

ing legislation," L. D. H. Weld, repre
sentative or. Swift and company, as
sured the senate agricultural com
mittee today. Summing up his two
days' argument against federal regu
lation of the industry as proposed in
the Kenyon and Kendrick bills, he
challenged the truth of the commis
sion's findings in a half dozen par
ticulars and ended by assailing the
commisison Itself.
"Don't you resent having this soft
of evidence put before you," he asked
tne committee members. "Do you
think you ought to allow a govern
ment bureau to make this unjustified
assault on a useful and necessary in
dustry?"
Mr. Weld said he had demonstrat
ed before the committee that the five
packers, far from controlling 25 per
cent of the wholesale grocery busi
ness, did less than three per cent of
it; that they did not control prices
either for livestock or meats: that
their profits were as moderate if not
lower than the profits of any other
industry; and that in numberless de
tails, an to capital investment, opera

Girl Wallingfords
Dupe Local Stores
Mrs. George H. Hirst, Ceputy county
probation officer from Douglas, was in
Bjsbee yesterday on juvenile court
matters. Among the cases brought to
her attention was that of two young
Tomen of Lowell, one 12 and the other
14 years of age, who have been writ
ing orders for suppliesto different
stores and signing the names of regu
yar patrons. Among the stores victim
ized was the Lowell Cash Grocery. It
is expected the girls' case will be taken
before Judge A. C. Lockwood in the i
superior court for disposition.
Many a wohian hesitates to try putting
up fruit at home.
She fears she will only waste expensive
materials.
It really is very simple. Just make your
preserving syrup with i Karo (Red Label)
and 4 sugar instead of sugar alone. '
You can then be as sure of your results
as the woman yjho always has "luck" with
her preserving. -
Nice fine, clear Karo Syrup has a natural
affinity for the fruit juices. It blends the
sugar with the juice brings out the rich
' fruity" flavor, and insures firm jams and
jellies that never "candy" in the glass.
A well-filled fruit pantry will give you
much pleasure this winter, when fresh fruits
are scarce and high, "if you just use Karo
Syrup with your sugar.
For Cooking, Baking and Candy Making Karo
Red Label) is used in millions of homes. In all
cooking and baking .lecipes use Karo instead of
sugar. It is sweet, of delicate flavor, and brings
out the natural flavor of the food.

stage. The witness answered that it
was, but left the stand without evi
dently having discovered whom he
had mistaken for McHenry.
- I. W. W. Had Hot Stove League.
Walsh was questioned at length
during cross-examination as to room
ers at his house during the strike
and deportation. He told of fre
quent meetings held around the stove.
In which the I. W. W. was discussed
and admitted that some of the men
appeared to be members or admirers
of the organization. Walsh also told
of a heated argument over the war
between Supples and Charles Wiess,
a German, he said, who was living in
one of his houses. The witness said
he did not stay to hear how the argu
ment ended, for fear it might end up
in "some crooked way."
Hist! Mellowdrammer!
Mike Pintidk, a Serbian, was the
star witness for the state during the
afternoon. His testimony concerned
principally M. C. Denny, Bert Grover,
Lee Jovanivich, Jack Monahan,
Donald Stetson. Christ Tomich and
Billy Woods, all of. the Warren dis
trict. Mike started off his testimony
at the climax. He was awakened in
the morning of July 12th, 1917, by the
screams of women and children and
the shoutiug of men. Rushing to the
outside of his house, he said, he
looked across the street and saw
Vuko Dela and the latter's wife ana
children being "beaten up" by Denny
and some other men. While Dela's
wife and children were abused, said
Pintick, the head of the house was
beaten over the head, dragged from
hi3 home by the neck and thrown into
a group of other Serbians. Accord
ing to Pintick's testimony during di
rect examination the German inva
sion of Belgium was a Sunday school
picnic compared with the offensive
against the Dela house by Denny,
Woodsr Grover and Tomich.
Donnybrook Is Only Hearsay.
On cross- examiaation he was asked
if he had seen Dela or any members
of. his- family struck by the defend
ants. He said that he had not, but
had been told that they were beaten.
He was asked if he had seen anyone
struck, during the deportations. He
said he had not, but that he heard
that many were molested. He was
asked if he had seen anybody who
had been beaten up and replied that
he was confident, that Dela had been
struck by some one, also, that another
Serbian named John Milutich, had
told him that he, Milutich, had been

istic publication he had. read.
Strange Bedfellows.
"Dunbar's Weekly" replied Pintick,
and the defendant's attorney roared
with laughter. He was asked what
other books he had read and replied.
"The iJJbor Journal, the Ore and the
riisbee Review."
Pintick was asked if he had ever
sold liquor to a man named Dunlap,
who was brought up on the stage in
front of the witness. Pintick said
he had not. He was then asked if he
had not sold liquor to Christ Tomick,
one of the defendants against whom
he testified. The county attorney ob
ejeted, with the declaration that such
a question might bring an affirmative
answer from "many of our most
prominent citizens." The question
was withdrawn good-naturedly by
the defense.
Court was adjourned until the aft
ernoon during the examination of
Charles Bentley. The latter testified
to having seen Billy Brakefield, Mark
P. Johns and Billy Woods during the
deportations. Brakefield, who was
deputy sheriff at Lowell at the time,
put him in line at Lowell, said Bent
ley. Johns, he said, he saw guarding
the deported men at Lowell and
Woods riding a horse at the Warren
ball park, guarding the men who
were to be deported.
Suggest Matinee for Dominic.
The defendants were visibly disap
pointed when court adjourned before
Dominic Catero, who appearea again
-yesterday to be sworn as a witness,
had a chance to ascend the stand.
One of the "kidnapers" suggested
that one session of, .court this week
be set aside as a "rhatinee," and that
autographed photographs of Dominic
be presented as the souvenirs.
The case of Jeff Dunnegan, of this
city, was given severance from the
blanket warrant yesterday afternoon
on account of illness of the defend
ant's children. The case will be set
later.

"TAN LAC IS A PERFECTLY WON
DERFUL MEDICINE," SALS MRS.
. JOSEPHINE FREEMAN
Miss Josephine Freeman of 647
Towne avenue, Los Angeles, Calif., a
jrraduate nurse, who had practiced
her profession for seventeen years,
recently made the remarkable state
ment that she has not only been re
lieved of a case of stomach trouble
of ten years standing by the use of
Tanlac, but that she had also gained
twenty-two pounds. in weight.
When asked if she would be will
ing for her experience with Tanlac
to be published, Mrs. Freeman said:
"Yes. indeed, I feel that I would
be doing anyone suffering from stom
ach trouble nd a rundown condition
a Rood turn by getting them to take
Tanlac. For ten years I have been
having trouble with my stomach. I
could not eat anything without suffer
ing Intense pains afterwards, and at
times I would bloat up so with gas
and such pains and pressure around
my heart that I would almost faint.
I became so nervous that I could
hardly get any sleep or rest and got
bo run down and weak that T could
scarcely keep up my work as a nurse.
I. of course, used all kinds of medi
cines and did everything possible,
but could never get more than Just
a little temporary relief.
"Finally a friend of my husband,
who had : been relieved of the same
trouble by taking Tanlac. advised him
to have me try it, and right from the
first bottle I began to feel better.
My appetite came back, my blood
circulation Improved wonderfully.
and my nerves be?an to quiet down.
I can eat just anything I want now
and never have the least pain or
trouble afterwards. I sleep Boundly
very night and. I feel rested and re
freshed on getting up In the morn
ings. When I bean takins: Tanlac I
was -weiarhin only one hnrdred and
thirty pounds ind was till losing.
But now I tip the scales at one hun
dred and fifty-two, maklnsr an actual
frain of twenty-two pounds on four
bottles of Tanlac. 1 Just feel ho
strong and well now that It's a real
pleasure for me to recommend the
medicine that helped me so much.
Tanlac is, a perfectly wonderful medi
cine and am glad to give credit
where it belongs."

ENTIRE STATE
ROAD FORGE IS
BEING REHD
I. T. Frazer, division engineer of the
State Highway Department, arrived in
Tombstone last night to complete ar
rangements for the suspension of all
state highway work in Cochise county.
The entire state force will be oUt of
Cochise county early in September.
The maintainance gang on th Bisbee
Tombstone highway was withdrawn
and sent to Fairbanks to help sv.r
fsce the stretch of road from the foot
of the hill to the S. P. tracks, and an
earnest effort w'il bo made to do this
before the close of workAugust 31.
Mr. Frazer stated that he regretted
the existing conditions, but in the face
of the orders of the supervisors the
state highway department could con
tract no indebtedness in Cochise coun
ty aft ex. August 31.
No charge for admission is made in
many of the Chinese theatres, which
depend entirely on the profits from
the sale of drinks and food products.

RETAIL GOVERNMENT SHOPS TO
BE OPENED IN LEADING CITIES
OF! NATION IN WAR ON H. C. L.
WASHINGTON, Aug. 26. Further
steps to bring down soaring prices
were taken today by the government,
the war department announcing plans
for opening retail stores in a number
of cities through which surplus
household commodities and clothing
will be made available to consumers
throughout the ceuntry.
Meantime, congressional commit
tees continued consideration of legis
lation designed to reduce the high
cost of living. This included amend
ments to the food control act to pun
ish profiteering and hoarding; bills
to regulate cold storage and appro
priations for the federal trade com
mission to investigate stocks and give
such information to the public.
Through the retail stores to be
opened by the war department, the
army's large surplus stocks of socks,
underwear, shirts, raincoats, blan
kets, gloves, tobacco, soap and other
household commodities will be sold.
Consumers in the large cities where
the stores will be operated will be
able to purchase over, the counter,,
but the stocks also will be made
available to persons in other com
munities through the parcel post.
Price lists are being prepared and
these will be furnished to all post
offices for the convenience of the pub
lic. While no announcement has yet
been made, it is expected that the
prices, like those on the foodstuffs
now being disposed of, will be con
siderably below the prevailing market.
AIR NAVIGATION TO

That's why Britain is most keenly in

apart. And there's 190 miles between

PART OF THE DAY'S WORK
WITH the preliminary hearing of nearly 200 defendants in
the "deportation" qases taken up Monday at Douglas
u.idor n hhnfcet indictment, another phase of what has
become a "cause celebre" is entered upon. It is to be
hoped that this group or detendants may succeed in having the
action advanced to a lfeial test before a jury with as much expedition
as did tUoai. included in the first "batch" of indicted men who have
been held To the superior court.
Not. until a jury passes upon the merits of the case will the issue
be disposed of in a clear-cut way that must remain satisfactory to all
Involved. And the soonter the matter is placed before a jury and de
cided the better it will be for the community as ja whole.
Crowded with dramatic features as the "deportation" cases have
biten, th" most interesting angle which the subsequent litigation has
developed was the departure of a special train Monday bearing away
from their homes for trial the men who hjave taken the largest part
in upbuilding the community and who prevented its industrial, col
lapse during the war crisis.
Those who were left iat home could not but feel the void that
was loft when nearly 200 men who play a vital part in the city's li;
and business were taken (away, forced to drop their activities for the
day or to leave them in the hands of othfers. Doctors were compelled
to leave their patients; merchants turned over laffairs to employes;
the police department was left half manned: men whose time is
worth thousands to themselves or their employes dropped everything
to sit for hours in train or courtroom that the fornjilities of the law
might be complied with.
But with it all. not a grumble of complaint was heard, although
the tiresome trip to Douglas and the more dreary hours in the court
room may have to bo repeated for week afijer week.
"It was worth it," is the viewpoint not only of the 174 defendants
but of the community of which they lare a part. In the litigtition that
must be thijrshed out before the record is clear, they are standing to
gether as they did when the honor and the industrial life of Bisbee
were at Etake; they are as firm of purpose as when thley determined
that no traitorous clique should stop the production of the precious
metals needed to carry on the war.
Bisbee's "Deportation Special No. 2" and the enforced absence
from honVj of her leading citizens is a part of the day's work; an
other step toward the final disposition of a case that w-ill clear the
atmosphere and pave the way for a better Bisbee than ever.
RECOGNITION FOR TUCSON
' i LTHOUttH she lost luer fight for a cantonment at the begin-
ning of America's entrance into the war, Tucson's salubrious
f- climate and excellent state university have at last gained
in part the official recognition, they merit. Thje government
has decided, after due consideration, to send to the University of
Arizona all gassed soldiers and others in need of fehabilitation who
want to take a course in vocational education.
Tucson's climate has long been recognized a3 the one most nearly
Ideal in this country for tho:te suffering from lung trouble or from
certain forms of nervcus diseases. Not only is it a healthful cli
mate, but an agreeable, nll-tho-year-round climate, except for a few
hot months in the sumnuei.
Yet when it came to the selection of a cantonment, Tucson's
natural advantages and her superior railroad facilities were ignored
and Dtmlng was selected. Tucson always has charged that it was
a political deal. At any rate, nearly 70.000 soldiers in training led a
life of misery in the wind swept, sandy cantonment near Deming
when they might have Keen comfortably and more healthfully situated
at Tucson and able to devote the maximum number of their waking
hours to needed drills and training.
But now the government has given the Old Pueblo and the state's
chief educational institution, belated lecognition. At least 200 serv
ice men partially disabled or in poor physical condition will be sent
to thjc Southern Arizona metropolis to regain their health and learn
a useful1 -occupation. The government provides each with ?S0 a
month for expenses, meaning $160,090 a month spent' in the com
munity. Th?3 barracks constructed at the University for soldiers who
were given mechanical training will be used for the new students. Y.
M. C. A. huts already have been constructed on the campus. The
University always has neasured up to the demands placed upon it.
both in war and in peace, and it will not be found wanting in the
work of rehabilitation.
What Do You Know?
TIIK WISEST MAN in the world knows only a tiny fraction of
what there is to be learned, and the mass of human knowl
edge, painfully acquired and handed on since our far-off
ancestors came down out of the trees, is only a faint glim
mer in the midst of the dark uuknown.
Much of the unknown is unknowable; a little of it, the human
mind laboriously takes possession of as centuries pass.
Most of us are amazingly ignorant. We are like the classic ex
ample of the school children, conning their books, who coulda't tell
what kind of wood their desks were made of.
Actually, we are afraid of seeming to know much outside of the
trodden ways; wo despise the "highbrow."
And at the same time, how contemptuous we are likely to be of
someone who seems to be more ignorant than ourselves!
The man who has stepped learning is living at a standstill. Make
everyone you meet your teacher, if you would get the most from life.
That boy scout, that venerable farmer, that sharp young salesman
each has a bit of special knowledge for you.
Be a student, even though your school days are in the remote
past, and not a mere book student.
And, so long as you keep your mind open, you will always be
humble. You never will despise "ignorance," but arrogance, spring
ing from a trivial wisdom, you will feverishly avoid.

MESA FIRM PAYS RAISERS
OF CANTALOUPES $181,182
MESA, Aug. 26.-Exactly $181,182.
06 was the total sum paid out by the
S. C Gerard company to the canta
loupe ..growers , of the Mesa district
for the season, just closed. Asked
yesterday as to the total receipts paid
to the growers in this vicinity, K. L.
Mumford, the local agent ot tne com
ban v. produced the bookkeeper's
figures to the above amount.
These figures, by the way, will
doubtless be surprising to the aver
nee nerson. for while the cantaloupes
were picked from something like 900
acres, the season is so snort ana tne
work so auicklv and ouietly done that
the big total is considerably more
than would be estimated by an out
sider. The money received as above
is for the cantaloupes alone, the
crates, nails, etc., not being included.
Three hundred ninety-one cars
w pre shinned, and within the last day
or so the Gerard company has closed
its office here, having mailed out to
each grower the entire individual
amount due on each of the four pools.
This is exceptionally quick work, and
the speedy returns is causing com
mendatory comment from the growers.
Beeinninc: September 1. Mr. Mum-
ford will sign up the acreage for next
voar TTe evnect s that approximately
1000 acres will be planted to cantaloupes.
The company Is now encouraging
lettuce shipments from this section,
and 150 acres have been signed up by
local ranchers. This lettuce win d-
planted around October 1. and will, if
conditions are favorable, bring in a
nice profit to the growers.
ROBBERS TAKE GATE
FROM WOMAN CASHIER
Pff OFNIX. Aue 26. Two Mexicans
overpowered a young woman employ
ed at the entrance gate of Riverside
park late last night f.na roDDea nei
of the evening's gate receipts, amount
ing to $195.15. The girl. Miss Fern
Squires of No. 224 East Van Buren
street, had left the entrance office at
11 o'clock, carrying a money sack con
taining the receipts, and was. making
her way through the park to the main
office, where she intended, as is the
nightly custom, to deliver the money
to the park managers.
Thr two Mexicans chose a moment
when the entrance to Riverside was
deserted and seized Miss Squires by
The arms. The young girl put up a
plucky fight, knocking one of the
men down, but dropping the money
bag as she did so. The other man
then picked up the sack and ran to
ward the river, followed by his con
federate.
Several persons who saw the Mex
irans running away started in pursuit.
The sheriff's office was also notified
and in a brief time several posses.had
Kt iiited out after the robbers. It was
like hunt in c for a needle in a hay
stack, according to a member of the
sheriff's office, as the men were lost
sieht of in the dense undergrowth
that lines the river.
Although every bit of counlry in (he
vicinity of the park was searched dur
ing the night r.o trace of the thieves
could be discovered. Miss Squires de

and wyll dressed. The only' clue"
dropied by the robbers Was a; black

beaten candlesticks of a compound of
gold, silver and copper, moulded into
shape by hand process, which served
the priests of many decades ago in
their labors at Tumacacori mission as
candlesticks for the altar as they
sang the mass. Crudely shaped but
rich in metal, really remarkable in
their design and in the curve of the
handles are these treasures which are
now in possession of Donald Mitchell,
the mining engineer, at Tucson.
Mr. Mitchell is an enthusiastic anti
quarian and every year goes to the
vicinity of the old mission where he
excavates in the hope of finding
something reminiscent of the old days
of the padres. These four candle
sticks and a fifth, much taller and evi
dently brou'it from Spain, are his la
test reward. One of the four is about
three inches in height, the other three
about two inches. Each is in a per
fect state of preservation except that
one is missing the" handle. These
were evidently buried in an old sack
as the decayed remnants of cloth
were found with them at the point 12
feet under the surface. .
Kolchak reverses are called a serious blow to tho policy of the
allies in Russia. All the policy needs is another Russian patriot to do
Its fighting.
GOOD ROADS BOOSTERS
COME UP FROM JEROME
FLAGSTAFF, Aug. 26. Robert Tal-
ley, superintendent of the United
Verde; Tom Taylor, superintendent
of the smelters at Clarkdale; and
Mr. Vanderbaugh, superintendent
of underground workings, were in
Flagstaff last Friday, having come
through over the Schnebly hill from
Jerome by auto.
The party was very much interest
ed in the road problem from Flagstaff
to Jerome and interviewed r. A. Kior
dan and other members of the newly
created county highway commission
and supervisors. The road to Jerome
and the Verde is one or the missing
links in the road from Jerome to
Preseott When completed the new
route would be much shorter if there
was a trood road to Jerome. It is hoped
that when the big bond Issue is final
ly made, that part of the money win
nvnmded on the south roads in or
der that we may be well connected
up with our southern neighbors anci
give them a direct outlet to the main
line.
3000 MEXICAN COTTON
PICKERS TO BE IMPORTED
YUMA, Aug. 26. With Yuma's 30,
000 bales of cotton all but ready to
pick, farmers of the valley have been
worrying over the labor situation.
Never before in the history of the
valley h$ there been such a labor
shortage and such a large amount of
work to be done.
Unless some solution is arrived at
within the next few days, Yuma
farmers will be at the mercy of cot
ton pickers this year and the price of
cotton picking will be higher than it
has ever been before in the history of
the country. ,
Pat O'Brien and V. Vernon Mar
grave, well-known Yuma valley men,
have during the past few weeks been
looking into the labor situation and
they have, they believe, arrived at a
solution of the labor diffculty.
O'Brien and Margrave propose to
import into the Yuma valley during
the cotton harvest two or three thou
sand Mexican laborers who will do
the work which the local cotton pick
ers are not able to do.
Probably the silence of the ad
ministration officials at Washing
ton on the coast railroad tie-up is
due to a strenuous effort to find
something in the League of Na
tions that will cover the situation.
At least one thing can be said
for Grover Cleveland. He kept the
mails moving throughout the rail
road strike during his administration.
TWO MORE BOOMS BURST
, With the high cost of living problem
4n its present unscrambled state, the
presidential boomlet for Herbert
probably won't get any farther than
the first line "trenchers" at Paris. We
note that Secretary Daniels also has
accommodatingly eliminated himself
as a 1920 possibility by saying his can
didacy in "in the hands of the people."
her innings and the undulatory
walk will be back In style. Also,
we will witness again that mar
velous transformation scene In
which the young woman who has
been so proud of her string bean
figure will blossom out like a full
bloom peonie.
GOOD CAMPAIGN MATERIAL
General Obregon's press agents are
stressing his success in handling the
M exican bean crop as the chief argtl
ment why he should be elected presi
dent of Mexico. We'll say that any
one who can make a million dollars a
year on beans ought to be able to pull
the Mexican treasury out of the hoie.
OLD FASHIONED POLICE CHIEF
In Chief Gerrity, Chicago evi
dently has a police head of the old
school, who wears old-fashioned
suspenders and believes that
clothes still have a place in the
cosmos of things. The other day
the chief went into the Ziegfeld
theater in Chicago and found the
girl ushers all wearing the scan
tiestof bathing suits. This may
have taken the cure off a poor
show, but the chief ordered the
girls to don skirts under the pub
lic morals act.
BEAR NOTE ON OIL BOOM3
It is a well known aphorism that oil
and water won't mix; yet dispatches
from Oklahoma state that a number
of wells.. h?ve.. been., forced-to shut
down because of water shortage.
PAGE THE 19TH INFANTRY
We had a hunch that it was a
mistake for the Bisbee baseball
teams to play any nine but the
Nineteenth infantry. Let's call in
the soldiers again and win an
other game. ,
HOPE SPRINGS ETERNAL
The "wet" advocates must be char
ter members of the band of hope. They
now assert "on the best of inside in
formation," that the president will ab
rogate the wartime "dry" law on Octo
ber 1, and we will have three months
of superlative wetness until the con
stitutional amendment goes into effect
January 1. The liquor men are almost
as optimistic as the old-fashioned gen
tleman on the "Deportation Special
No. 2" Monday, who was right there
with a bottle opener when the near
beer showed up.
IN TIME OF PEACE
The Mormon religion is nothing
if not practical. Senator Reed
Smoot of Utah has written one
of his constituents that the revela
tions as given to the prophet Joseph
Smith and recorded in the doc
trines and covenants of the Book
of Mormon, preclude hope that rat
ification of the League of Nations
will prevent future wars. And so
Senator Smoot goes serenely on
his way, insisting on reservations
to the league and incidentally
making votes for himself hi his
own home state. President Wilson
seems to have forgotten to take
along an expert on Mormon doc
trines when he went to Paris, al
though he had experts on every
thing else in the American party.
But perhaps the president thought
he already knew enough about
Mormonism.
HORRORS OF POLITICS
Add to the horrors of politics the
fact that office seekers are going to
make use of the phonograph next cam
paign! and feed the voters up on canned
speeches. This will make the "dry"
banquet more painful than ever and
may give the old-fashioned, after-dinner
speaker a new Tease of life. In the
absence. of any other anodyne, why
not try laughing gas during the ordeal?
HIP, HIP, HOORAY!
A fashion note from Paris says
hips are to be back in style this fall.
Now the "plump" girl after sev
eral seasons of eclipse will have
REDUCING THE H. C. OF RIDING
We saw a man on the Bisbee
Warren street car line the other
day who had the art of riding for
nothing down to a science. First
he offered the conductor five pen
nies and when ths latter refused
take them, tendered a $50 bill.
Of course the conductor had no
change, but the look the free trip

IT'S THE K. O. THAT COUNTS
Much as the crowd at the prize fight
the other night admired the boxing,
it must be admitted that it was the
two knock outs that gave the "fans"
the real punch.
PAVING MORE STREETS
IN WINSLOW ASSURED
W1NSLOW, Aug. 26 The city
council met in special meeting Mon
day night to receive the report of
the chamber of commerce in regard
to paving four blocks of the down
town business district and the na
tional highway through the town. Mr.
Walton, as secretary, made a highly
satisfactory report, saying that all
the property holders interviewed,
which was at least 90 per cent of the
property holders on the proposed
paved streets, they had not found one
objection. This will assure the pav
ing at the earliest possible moment,
which should be early spring.

GILA RIVER FLOOD
CONTROL IS URGED
S AFFORD, Aug. 26. Andrew Kim
ball presided at a meeting at Pima
Wednesday afternoon, at which re
newed interest was given to the
the carrying into
U'fect of the recommendations of the
7. . 1 - . Cl.wl r.iml i t I OT1 S4 of
Ulinsteau report 011 nu"u vk..".,..v -the
Gila river.
At this meet inc. the fact was
brought out and strongly emphasized
I hat the movement now being Organi
zed in the Gila valley is primarily for
flood control ai d not for land recla
nialion. It therefore differs radically
from the reclamation movement now
being organized to secure the con
st ruction of the San Carlos dam.
The Olmstead report recommends
two things: First, the regulation of
the flow of the Gila river by source
stream works, so that the river will
flow the same volume of water
throughout the year; and, second, the
standardization of the cliannel of I he
Gila river froiii above Solomofiville to
the lower end of the valley, oy build
ing such works .as may be, necessary
1o hold the river in a fixed cliannel
from one end of the valley to the
oilier, put an end forever to the ter
rible devastation that the river has
bt-tn annually causing for the l.ut 2i
years.
ANOTHER ESCAPE FROM
THE INSANE ASYLUM
PHOENIX, Aug. 26 Another addi
tion to the long list of prisoners es
caped from (he state insane asylum
was made yesterday morning when
Manuel Perez, a Frenchman, in charge
of the guards of the "violent" ward,
walked to liberty. He had not been
captured and. returned to the asylum
this morning. Neither was a general
hunt started to apprehend him.
Perez was missed, from the asylum
following the usual exercise of the
j inmates on the grounds during the
! morning hours. Two guards sup
posedly have been watching the in
flates of the violent ward. Terez had
'walked off unnoticed. When the in
mates were counted in. he was missed.
' Following this, members of the
prison guard in an automobile drove
up and down the main highway to
ward Phoenix and Tempe for a short
distance. They also telephoned the
Phoenix police ana the sheriff. No
other effort was made to apprehend
: the escaped insane man, according to
j the admission of one of the guards
! here last night.
j Since the first of the year escapes
! from the insane asylum have been
i frequent, say guards from the institu
tion, and within the past few weeks
inmates have come to the realization
1 that if they make away, little effort
I is; made; lp recapture them. Several,
,it is slated. " have remained at large
for long periods of. time, while a few
have never been recaptured.

MINING NOTES
There is no camp in Arizona terri
tory which prides itself upon such ab
solute harmony as that of the great
Copper Queen. The oldest resident
has yet to hear a complaint between
employer and employe.
Report comes in that a good force
of men is being employed on the
Black Diamond mine. The smelter
has been installed and development
work is forging ahead.
T. B. Shields who has charge of
the contract for the Copper Glance
reports that work is progressing fine
ly and believes that the next 200 feet
should make some showing of ore.
There are 10 men employed there
now.
WHAT OTHER PAPERS SAY
CARRANZA'S ATTITUDE
New York World.
American intervention cannot be
forced by oil and mines and ranches.
It might be forced by the Mexican
government itself. Those who, like
The World, are steadfast opponents of
intervention except as a last despe
rate resort are compelled to admit
that nobody else is doing so much to
bring it about as the Carranza gov
ernment itself, not by its failure to
maintain perfect order in Mexico but
by its attitude toward the only great
government that is sincerely desirous
of helping it.
ONE MORE OPPORTUNITY
New York Times.
Once more an opportunity is offered
to Carranza government to redeem it
self, but it cannot have unlimited
time, it must turn oev a new leaf
and satisfy the reasonable demands
of the State Department. Otherwise
there will be a day of reckoning not
long postponed. Carranza must be
well aware that, short of actual inter
vention, there are well known meth
ods of exerting international piessure
and constraint which, if we are forced
to adopt them, would have hichly in
convenient consequences for him and
his pretense of a government.
WHY HESITATE?
New York Sun.
Why' should the President hesitate'
an instant about "surrendering" to
American opinion? If he could sur
renderor yield with grace and asil
ity onso many of his fixed points or
principles whn matching minds in
Paris with toreigii statesmen, who
Keeps him from a little retrocession
here on our ova beloved toil tor the
sake of America's furnituie? .WEDNESDAY, AUGUST 27, 1919.

Mining and Financial News
BY REVIEW
STOCKS AND BONDS
NEW YORK, Aug. 26. Trading on
the stock exchange today was influ
enced almost exclusively by President
Wilson's attitude toward the railroad
shopmen and lis survey of current
problems arising from living costs,
wages and attendant conditions.
Contrary to expectations in more
than one quarter berore the market
opened, Wall Street accepted the pres
ident's stand as highly favorable to
the constructive side of finance and
backed this belief V-y noeral buying
of various issues, including many
speculative shares.
The president's denial of the prin
cipal demands of the shopmen and
his appeal to public opinion consti
tuted the engrossing topic among the
bankers and railway executives. The
general view was that these features
would go far towards clarifying Im
pending labor difficulties.
Kails, outstanding features of the
preceding day, were less in evidence,
being replaced in activity and
strength by steels, equipments, mo
tors, oils and food shares at extreme
gains of 2 to almost 15 points.
Metals asserted some of their re
cent prominence in connection with
reports that contracts for domestic
and foreign consumption were pro- ( "Jerican ueei 57

THE GRAIN MARKETS.
CHICAGO, Aug. 26. Bearish senti
ment today was reflected in the corn
market, which throughout the session
averaged somewhat lower, though
there were occasional slight rallies.
The selling was scattered and there
was a lack or outside support. Of
ferings of Texas corn in northern
markets attracted attention. Tho
sample market showed little change.
Corn closed weak at near the low
points, prices being to lc net
lower with September at $1.79 to
$1.79 and December $1.41 to
Oats finished to c net
higher and provisions finished 27c to
75c lower.
Domestic shipping demand was fair
ly active, sales exceeding 50,000 bush
els. Country oiferings were not large,
scarcity of cars preventing much
movement of corn.

KILLED IN AXE
REVOLVER DUEL
As the result of an axe and revol
ver duel at a road camp near Double
Adobe. Elmo E. Wilson today is dead
and Conrad Leake is in the Douglas
jail facing a charge of murder. Wil
son was shot three times, one bullet
striking his spinal column. He died
shortly after being rushed to the Cal
umet hospital. Leake surrendered to
Sheriff McDonald.
A quarrel between the men arose
Monday night when Lease is alleged
to have charged Wilson with stealing
from the Two.ney roaa outfit with
whom he was employed.'" Wilson was
a rival road crew man.
The row took place at Wilson's
camp. Leake bears a cut on his head
which he claims was inflicted by an
axe in the hands of Wilson. Frank
Young, a fellow employe of Leake,
who say the quarrel, corroborates
this story. ,
Young fled from the scene of the
shooting to Douglas, where he in
formed Sheriff McDonald, who was
in the city, of the fatality.
The sheriff with Deputy A. E. Par
mor, set out for the Wilson camp and
met Leake on the way. The man sur
rendered himself and his weapon,
which contained three empty shells.

FOR FIGHT AT
TUCSON, Aril, : ug. 26. G. J. Kel
ly, well known fJpht promoter, an
nounced this morning that he had
completed arrangements for a mati'h
between Benny Leonard, champion
lightweight of the world, and either
Happy Woods of Tucson or Kid Pal
mer of y the N'ineteenth infantry at
Douglas. The fight will take place
at Phoenix November 7, during the
state fair and will be the stellar at
traction, from an athletic standpoint,
of the big celebration.
Kelly's announcement was made fol
lowing receipt of a telegram from Bil
ly Gibson, manager of Benny Leonard,
in New Yoik cUy. Leonard will re
ceive by far a greater sum than was
ever paid a fighter in the history of
Arizona. Several times he had re-,
fused to come and it was dirty by add
ing several thousand dollars to
every offer that he' was finally in
duced. The announcement of the match be
tween Happy Woods and Kid Palmer
is also news to the fans, as it was
completed by long distance telephone
only last night. The fight will take
place in this city September 16. Kel
ly is anxious to determine the Ari
zona fighter who can put up the best
fight with Leonard and he is certain
it is either Woods or Palmer.
Woods is the sensational Tucson
boy who in his last eight fights here
has won every one by Jae K. O. route
early in the battle. His last fight was
with Battling Burt last Friday night
and he ran true to form.
Palmer has decisions over Russell
Chambers and Frenchie Desmarais to
his credit and is 'rated as one of the
best fighters in the southwest.

B. L. Smith, president of the Lunch

contrary to reports the regular bi
monthly luncheons would continue at
the Copper Queen hotel. It has at
first been thought that owing to near
ly 200 of the citizens being forced to
attend the "Oeportation" trials in
Douglas every day, the luncheons
would be called off, but Mr. Smith has
found that there are still enough
members in the city to make the
luncheons a success.
Next Thursday an important ses
sion of the club will be beld at the
noon luncheon, when the subject of
playgrounds will be taken up. Sev
eral speakers will be heard on this
topic and an iniormal discussion held.
The Luncheon club is the first of the
civic organizations to get behind the
