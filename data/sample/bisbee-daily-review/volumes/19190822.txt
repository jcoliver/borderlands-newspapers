was not among the dead.
Captain Matlack said he passed a

commander, Matlack reported, asked
where the American troops were go
ing. "When he was informed that the
Americana were pursuing bandits who
had held American" aviators, the Car

TRAIN SCHEDULE
picked up the cavalry commander and
returned with him to report the puni
tive expedition to General Jos. T. Dick
mander, commander of the southern
department.
U. S. Pursuers in High Spirits
According to Matlack the American
troops are in high spirits and keen for
the chase. They re willing to ride
day and night through storms and over
all aorts of trails to overtake the
bandits.
Among the most enthusiastic mem
bers of the expedition are the young
aviators, Peterson and Davis, Matlack
said. The two airmen, according to
the captain, have been having the tme
of their lives, enjoying every minute
of the hunt for the bandits who
threatened them with death.
W rt maitnt nrnrrpos in the
pursuit of the bandits. Hard storms!
have slackened our speed somewhat,
but we consider that we made good
time," said Captain Matlack.
"After leaving the Rio Grande Mon
day morning, soon after daylight, the
expedition followed a fresh trail. The
four men to whom the money had been
paid had a start of more than five
hours on us. We followed them to a
high mountain pass, where the four
scattered, one going north and three
southwest, as indicated by the fresh
tracks. They scattered like quail, and
it was difficult to follow them because
of faint trails.
Mexicans Open Fire
"The fight with tae bandits in the
fortified blockhouse started as soon as
the American troops commenced to
search the place, fire being opened by
the Mexicans from loop holes'. The
troops returned the fire.
. "Four bodies wear found. Two of
the bandits escaped. They are still
being pursued. These two latter out
laws are believed to have been mem
bers of Renterlaa' gang, but the avia
tors could not identify them."
The men who held them were deB
parate characters, known on both
sides of the river.

CARRANZA ASKS
BE ITIRA1
Formal Protest Against Chase
Of Bandits Made, But Gen.
Dieguez, in Chihuahua, Cites
1882 Treaty As U. S. Right
WASHINGTON, Aug 21. Immed
iate withdrawal .of the American
troops now on the trail of bandits in
northern Mexico was asked today by
Mexican Ambassador Bonillas, who
called at the state, department to pre
sent a formal protest from the Carran
za government. T3ie text of the pro
test was not male public and offi
cials would not discuss it further than
to say that no reply had been made.
At the war department it was said
that no additional reports on the oper
ations of the American forces had
been received from Major General
Dickman, commanding the southern
department.
The troops now are well into Mexi
co and army officers hope that before
returning they will clean out bandits
from the stretch ct territory twenty
miles south of the border where they
are operating.
Whether a reply to the Mexican
protest will be sent has not been an
nounced. Such protests have been
made heretofore without drawing a re
sponse, officials regarding them as
having been submitted largely for the
record. The American forces went
into Mexico on a "hot trail," seeking
the bandits who held the American
army aviators Lieutenants Davis and
Peterson for ransom, and it was in
dicated today that the Mexican pro
test would not hasten their with
drawal. TREATY Ori882 CITED
PRESIDIO, Tex., Aug. 21. General
Manuel Dieguez, commander of the
Mexican federal force at Chihuahua
City, has telegraphed General Antonio
Pruneda, the commander of the Car
ranza column now operating near
Cuchillo Parado, that the American
troops are within their rights in pur
suing bandits in Mexico. General
Dieguez cited the treaty of 1882 be
tween America and the Mexican gov
ernments. '
Cosme Bengochea announced that
General Pruenda hs been ordered to
instruct all' commanders and officials
in his district to avoid friction be
tween the two armies now operating
below the border in pursuit of ban
dits. The message was conveyed to
General Pruenda by an. American air
plane. .
DIEGUEZ RELIEVES TENSION
MARFA, Tex., Aug. 21. Receipt of
a telegram from General Manuel Dieg
uez, who comman Includes the Ojin
aga district, by General Antonio Pru
neda, commander of that district, stat
ing that American troops were wholly
within their rights in pursuing bandits
in accordance with the treaty of 1882,
relieved fear that there might be a
clash between isolated Carranza
troops of the Ojinaga district and
American troops pursuing bandits.
The receipt of this telegram from
General Dieguez, who is stationed at
Chihuahua City, was announced by
Mexican officials here after it had
been dispatched by American air
plane to General Pruenda in the field
near Cuchillo Parado.
The treaty of 1882, cited at the time
of the Pershing expedition into Mex
ico ,as interpreted here, permits Mexi
can troops to come into the United
States in pursuit of bandits who
might cross to the American side from
Mexico. The treaty is said to have
originated at the time when American
and Mexican troops were pursuing the
Apache leader, Geronimo, back and
forth between the two countries while
the Apaches were committing whole
sale depredations.

Chewing Gum And
Smokes Sent To
Bandit Pursuers
MARFA, Tex., Aug. 21.
Arrangements were made to
night for aviators going to
the border tomorrow to carry
100 'pounds of chewing to
bacco, cigarettes, smoking
tobacco and chewing gum,
for the American soldiers
across the border. This was
done at the request of the
commanders of the punitive
expedition, who said the men
were out of tobacco and were
anxious to get chewing gum
to relieve their thirst on the
long, "dry marches. Estab
lishment of a landing field in
Mexico for the aviators is
being planned, so that the
airmen may land there in
stead of returning to Pre
sidio, Texas, to alight.
TO BE OPENED
Market Committee of the City
. Council and American Legion
Select the Central Theatre in
Lowell As Site For Project
The city market committees from
the city council and the American
Legion got together at the Copper
Queen hotel-last night with the result
that the project Is to be started at
once. No suitable site for the market
being available in Bisbee, the site of
the old Central theater in Lowell has
been selected, and the market will
open one week from tomorrow.
Spaces for stalls will be marked
off for farmers, and every effort made
to have as many of them present as
possible with their wagonloads of
"produce. Also all the housewives of
the city will be urged to come out
and make the opening day a success.
The market will open at 8 o'clock,
a. m. and will be an open-air affair
for the time being. If It proves a
success, a permanent site will be se
lected either in Plsbee or Lowell and
permanent quarters constructed. The
project will be financed partly by
private subscription although the
city council may be able to lend some
assistance.
The market Is to be run with the
backing of the city council and will
be under the direct supervision of a
committee composed of one man ap
pointed by the council, one by the
legion, and a third member, a resi
dent either of Lowell or Warren, ap
pointed by these two. If the market
is placed on a permanent basis, a
market master, one experienced in
the business, will be employed at a
regular salary. Meantime, it is ex
pected a laborer will be hired to keep
the market place clean.
Regarding this plan for the con
struction of a small refrigerating
plant where farmers who kill their
own beeves could place the meat fc
preservation until disposed of, it was
states that arrangements could be
made to place the meat in the cold
storage rooms of the Bisbee Improve
ment company at Lowell, taking out
only enough for the market to supply
each day's demands.

been made, the machine went on to Yuma, and started on the
return trip jresterday. The aviators were due here at about 4
p. m. yesterday.

Fans Coming From AH Parts Southwest
To Witness the FastLoughrey-Chambers
Bout Here Tonight; Good Preliminaries
Frank Loughrey, the Philadelphia
"bearcat,' 'and Russell Chambers, the
battling First cavalryman from Doug
las, are all set for their bout at the
Warren baseball park tonight, when
they will try conclusions over the ten
round rout. Ixiughrey was well under
weight yesterday and will tip the
beams tonight at around 142 pounds.
Chambers, too. has had hut little dif
ficulty in making the weight.
It is expected that a crowd of from
1S00 to 2000 people will witness the
match. A large delegation is coming
up from Douglas. Jack McDonald, who
will referee, will bring along a bunch
from El Paso and Tucson, Tombstone,
Benson, Nogales and other near-by
points will he represented. Several
carloads of "fans" also will come from
Cananea.
A force of workmen was busy yes
terday constructing te rfng and plac
ing the seats. A brilliant lighting svs
tem will ba installed. Besides the
main event, three good preliminaries
of nix rounds each have been arranged.
The semi final was to be a stx-round
go between Dusty Rhodes. First cav
alry, and Johnny Meyer of Bisbee. at
150 pounds. Rhodes, however ,is sick
in the hospital and the doctors will
not even permit him to go as a spec
tator, so Kid levine of the same regi
ment will take his place. Levine has
recently returned from an army school
at San Antonio where he did consid
erable fighting, and is said to be a
clever mitt artist.
Other bouts will be between Red
Vaughn, First cavalry," and Johnny
Hughes of Bisbee, six rounds at 142
pounds, and KidBruno of Douglas and
Kid Edmunds of Fort Bliss, six rounds
at 122 pounds.
The big bout is attracting wide
spread attention among boxers and
managers throughout the southwest,
and there has been an avalanche of
challenges to fight the winner. The
latest came yesterday, when Secretary
Tom Fean of the Warren District Ath
letic club, received a letter fwrtn Har
rv Knowles. manager for Steve Dalton
at Olohe, seeking a match for his boy

Well Known Salesman Praises Tanlac
For Ending Four Years
Trouble
"I have been relieved of four years
suffering, and have gained exactly
fourteen pounds in weight since
commenced taking Tanlac," said R. A.
Whitcomb, a well known salesman for
the Caldwell Grocery Co., who lives
at 2370 Franklin Ave., San Diego, Cal.,
the other day. r
"My trouble started with an attack
of acute indigestion," continued Mr.
Whitcomb, "and these spells have
been coming pretty often for the past
three years. In fact, when I began
to take Tanlac, my stomach was in
such bad condition -that everything I
ate would cause me to suffer terribly
afterwards. I would have the worst
sort of cramping pains in the pit of
my stomach, and when these spells
hit me, I would be in so much actual
misery that cold sweat would pop out
all over my body. Sometimes gas
would form so bad that it would rise
up into my chest and cause my heart
to palpitate, and make me feel so
weak that I would almost faint. These
troubles kept getting worse all the
time until I was bo run down and
worn out that I was hardly able to
work.
"One day last fall I read about a
man who had suffered exactly as I
did, and had been greatly relieved by
taking Tanlac, and I thought that if
it helped him so much, it ought to do
me some good, and I immediately
bought a bottle. Well, sir. Tanlac
fixed me up just like it did the other
fellow, and this convinces me that
anybody who suffers as I did. can de
pend on Tanlac for relief. Why, I am
as well and strong now as I ever was,
and my troubles have been completely
overcome. I have a fine appetite and
eat just anything I want and I never
have a sign of indigestion or sour
stomach. My strength has come back
to me, and I can do as much hard
work as ever. Tanlac Is one medicine
that comes up to all that is claimed
of it, and I wouldn't hesitate to rec
ommend it to anybody."

be congratulated on the success of their initial experiment In
purchasing and reselling to the public some of the surplus
food which the army had on hand ,whea hostilities ceased. A carload
of canned vegetables has been received and distributed in a satisfac
tory manner and a carload of bacon is on the way.
Mayor Erickson first conceived the idea of taking advantage or
Secretary Baker's offer to sell army food supplies to the public at
ccst. plus freight. The Central Labor Union took upon itself the
task of listing orders for the produce and the American Legion com
mittee quickly solved the question of financing the project. Thus w
find three different organizations widely separated In their basic in
terests, harmoniously and effectively working together for the com
mon good.
Having taken the orders for the first carload of supplies, thw
labor union committee also handled the distribution of the food stores
to the public, and this was accomplished in a highly efficient man
ner. To dispose of $11,000 worth of groceries in a day and a hali
is no small task.
The purchase of this army food accomplished the purpose In
tended, to eliminate the profits of the middleman and supply the con
sumer at as nearly cost price as possible. No one "made anything"
on the deal except the original packers. The food was "sold to the
public at just what it cost the war department. .plus the freight and
the war tax. Mr. R. J. Wilbert, who handled the carload of supplies
Tor the Central Labor Union, received nothing for his trouble, but
the union has voted to recompense him for the time he lost from his
work in the mines.
All in all the experiment has proved a success.
A PROGRESSIVE MOVE
SOME of the leading merchants of the Warren district have for
some time been considering the advisability of opening their
stores at S:30 in the morning and closing at 5:30 p. m., instead
of opening at 8 and closing at 6. This would mean an hour's
less work for the employes and an hour's less time for shopping, but
under modern business efficiency methods, it is felt certain the
usual' full day's business could be transacted during this short period
without inconvenience.
The daylight saving bill ' repeal having bee accomplished
Wednesday in congress, the extra half hour of daylight in the even
ing will give shoppers and employes a chance to get home before
dark during the coming winter. The matter will be taken, up by the
Warren District Commercial club, of which a majority of the mer
chants are members, and those who are in favor of the proposal are
confident it will succeed.
In nearly all the large cities the leading stores do not open up
until 8:30 or 9 o'clock. Some of the more exclusive shops keep bank
ing hours and do not open their doors until 10 a. m. Experience has
proved that the shorter hours make for increased efficiency on the
part of employes and that business shows no decrease as a result.
The country town stores in days gone by used to open up at 7
o'clock winter and summer and stay open until 8 or 9 o'clock at night
on the theory that hot one guilty' penny should escape. The smalle
stores in the smaller towns sometimes continue this practice. But the
really successful stores havefound this practice obsolete and havo
outgrown it.
Of course ,it wilt be necessary to get the agreement of the ma
jority of the merchants to the new plan, but this, it is believed, will
not bo difficult.
DUSSIA'S PLIGHT.
HAT IS A QUEER story that comes from RifJsia via Stock
holm. It is to the effect that Lenine proposes to retire
from the premiership of the Soviet governient on condi
tion that War Minister Trotsky is put in command of the
Red army and by thus dropping power for a time demonstrate that
no other party is able to reorganize Russia. In other words, he would
increii.se existing chaotic conditions, if such a thing is possible ( trust
ing that achievement to his lieutenant), until they become so intoler
able that the people would recall him to power. It is asserted that
his views on this poi it are endorsed by the several commissioners of
his government, and that it is seriously proposed to try the experi
ment. During the war German professors were credited with being
adepts in psychology. They knew in advance, or pretended to Know,
what millions of people would do under certain conditions and their
official dupes proceeded to make those conditions. Many of the in
humanities practiced were based upon the theory that what would
terrorize themselves must ncessarily produce like effects upon their
opponents. But they must now surrender the palm to that precious
pair in I'etrograd who propose new horrors for the patient people
whom they have misgoverned.
What a calamity that Russia, scarcely second to the United
States in natural resources, should be prevented from playing its
economic part for the relief of the world's needs and those of its own
much oppressed people. '
The first thing we know, the peace treaty will be a scrap of paper
entirely surrounded by reservations.
Some of the relief movements are bound to encounter engine
trouble.

the mob spirit.

TUCSONANS LARGELY BUY
WAR DEPARTMENT FOOD
TUCSON, Aug. 21. The lower cost
of living rode triumphantly over the
city yesterday with a city grocery
store opened in the council room of
the city hall, and a crowd cleaning up
the supply assigned to the postmaster
to sell. Thousands of dollars worth
of provisions have been bought since
the first announcement of the sale of
government released goods and the
supply is not ended and the demand
continues.
Five hundred dollars worth of can
ned goods was disposed of at the city
hall by Councilman A. C. Bernard and
the remainder of a carload will prob
ably be disposed of before this eve
ning. Orders at the city hall began com
ing in early and continued until late
in the afternoon when Mr. Becnard
and his assistants closed a perfect day
of distribution in which the individual
orders ran from $5 to $100, each in
dividual evincing a desire to buy the
limit of his pocketbook, to hoard
against the day when the government
will have closed out its storage goods.
Some purchased enough canned goods
to last all fall and winter. Others for
the next few weeks. Many small buy
ers were disappointed to learn that
the city could not venture to split
cases because of the need of absorb
ing the freight cost of the case itself.
Those left determined to organize
neighborhood clubs to split cases and
take over the goods they wanted.
The hours for purchasing at the city
hall beginning this morning will be
from 9 to 1 o'clock and from 2 until
4 o'clock.

BLACK FELT HAT ONLY
CLUE IN ,CREME MURDER
PHOENIX, Arizona. August 21
No clue more tangible than a man's
black felt hat was discovered in their
search of the scene of the slaying of
Harry Creme by the city and county
officers. This hat was introduced in
the justice court late yesterday after
noon, and each of the score of wit
nesses was questioned as to whether
or not he could identify the owner of
the hat.
No satisfaction along this line of
questioning was obtained by Justice
Wheeler or the assistant county attor
neys who conducted the inquest. At
the close of the hearing the Greeks
were released, and the coroner's jury
was very little wiser in regard to the
mysterious circumstances surrounding
the death or Crenie, the panibler. at
the door of the Athenian club on the
second floor of 41 Wall street early
Monday morning.
Although success has not crowned
their efforts, the officers have not re
laxed their tearch tor the guilty man.
They are following each slender
thread to its end in the hope of lo
cating the man and furnishing a mo
tive for the crime.

It was also learned that the brew

shortly and operated under a huge
tax. Part of the proceeds derived
from the sale of beer and wines will
be given to the Cruz Galvez school
and the saloons will be granted a spe

According to reliable information,
beer will contain nearly 5 per cent
alcohol and will be sold at. 75 cents
per pint.

BONDS ARE LEGAL SAYS
THE ATTORNEY GENERAL
PHOENIX. Arizona, August ' 21.
Marataining that the people of Mari
copa county had a legal right to bond
the county for $4,000,000 for roads, the
attorney general's office today made
public an opinion on the question,
which was rendered at the request of
Assistant County Attorney R. A. Jar
rett. The question was raised, it is
said, by attorneys for the interests
who purchased the bonds in Chicago.
One of the questions raised was
whether the county was legally able
to redeem the assumed indebtedness
of road districts No. 1, 2 and 3, out of
the $4,000,000 received for the bonds.
The attorney general's opinion denies
that this could legally be done, stating
that the $4,000,000 was voted for the
purpose of building roads only. The
indebtedness of the special road dis
tricts aggregated $110,000, and it was
suggested by the bond attorneys that
this amount be redeemed from the
money realized by the sale of the
bonds.
The opinion states that the bonded
indebtedness of the three special road
districts was assumed by the voters
of the county in addition to the pro
posed $4,000,000 road fund, and that
the election made legal the raising of
the bond issue over the legal 4 per
cent set by law as the limit withoul
an election.

his. license to marry, papa Morgan
was very wroth and made a complaint
in justice court against Church for
perjury. No trace could be found of
the young people having left the dis
trict this morning on any of the stage
lines, so it was concluded that they
went out on the Arizona Eastern. Ar
rangements were made by the sher

COOL R. R. ENGINEER
PREVENTS DISASTER
PRESCOTT, Aug. 21. Through the
cool action and prompt manner in
which Engineer E. E. Lee acted on
Saturday night in bringing his engine
to a standstill at the right time, the
loss of life w hen a bridge went out on
Lynch creek, near the Hall ranch, was
averted, as well as a large amount' of
property saved from destruction.
The bridge is one of the longest on
the Bradshaw road, and appeared to
have been undermined by a cloud
burst a short time before the train
reached that point.
On entering the frail structure and
passing over about half way, Engineer
Lee felt his engine giving way and in
stantly perceiving the danger, he op
ened wide the steam valve and sent
the locomotive over the danger point,
when with a cool head he told his fire
man to shut orf the oil and both then
jumped to the creek bed, the proced
ure rrom first to last requiring only
a few seconds. The train broke in
two. the passenger coach remaining
on the opposite side of the stream.
A transfer was made and at about
12 o'clock Saturday night passengers
arrived in this city.

REPRESENTATION OF NO
COUNTY TO BE REDUCED
PHOENIX. Aug. 21. No county will
lose out in the representation in the
state legislature. This was the an
nouncement turned loose from the at
torney general's office today, with the
discovery' of the fact that the reappor
tionment law, which was signed by
Governor Hunt on December 5 last,
contains a provision expressly stating
that "no county shall have a smaller
number of representatives than that
to which it is now entitled."
This means that Cochise, Greenlee,
Graham and Yuma counties will not
lose one representative each, as pre
viously stated, and the only change in
the matter of reapportionment will be
in. Maricopa count v, which , hereafter
will be entitled to 9 votes in the house
instead of six. This will increase the
membership in the house from 35 to
"S. but will not materially affect the
political complexion of the legislature
as heretofore figured.
ARMY DROPS PLANS
FOR TROOPS AT YUMA
YUMA. Aug. 21. Yuma people will
be disappointed to learn that the sol

ed in this city are not coming and
that Yuma in the future will be the
largest undefended city on the Mexi
can border. Trne, the Mexican condi
tions south of Yuma have never
proven serious, but notwithstanding
there are large potentialities and a
Mexican raid up through the Yuma
valley could be arranged and carried
out with but little Interference from
American troops. Soldiers should be
stationed at Yuma, but unless the gov
ernment changes its mind, troops will
not be sent to this point, at least at
the present time.
The following letter has been re

THE NEW MENACE.
Do you realize that there is a
new menace abroad in the land,
one which may assail us in any
street, at any corner, even in the
very halls of our public build
ings? A menace against which
the authorities seem helpless, a
constant peril against which men
and women are almost powerless
to defend themselves. This hid
den danger, innocent appearing
enough, lurks at uneypt rled spots,
always ready to trke its ioll of
life and limb. Steps should be
taken at once, even at the cost of
martial law, to overcome this
summer peril. It is more treacher
ous than the rattle snake, for it
gives no warning; it is deadlier
than the banana peel, for it covers ,
more ground. We refer, Mr.

In his youth Mark Twain edited a
weekly journal in a small western
town, says the Youth's Companion. A
subscriber wrote to him one day to
remark that he had discovered a
spider concealed in the folds of a re

wanted to know whether such an oc
currence was a sign of good or bad
luck.
The young editor replied in the next
issue as follows:
"Constant Reader: The appearance
of a spider in a copy of last week'g
paper was a sign of neither good nor
bad luck; that intelligent insect was
merely studying our columns In order
to ascertain whether any store in the
neighborhood had failed to advertise
in our paper, in order that he might
make for that establishment and there
weave a web across the doorway,
where he might dwell in undisturbed
peace."

The ullies withheld the necessary

THE PRESIDENT'S ADDRESS
Boston Transcript.
Cause for national congratulation is
afforded by the evidence in the presi
dent's address to the congress that he
has at last turned hts attention from
"the heart of the world" to face the
task of lifting the load from the back
of America. The five remedial laws
to lower prices which he proposes de
serve the honest study of both houses
of congress. They involve too much
for a hasty assessment of tutlr mer
its. It is enough, however, to know
that they are aimed at a common ob
jectiveto reduce the cost of living,
to presecute the profiteers of capital
and of labor, to focus the eyes and
efforts of the builders, in all walks of
life, of America's prosperity upon the
imperative duty of production for
congress to consider them carefully,
in connection with alleviating legisla
tion of the same purpose upon which
its committees have been at work for
several months.

STOCKS AND BONDS j
NEW YORK, Aug. 21. Virtually the
same miiuences wnicn prei.jyjia.icu
yesterday's depression in the stock
market were prevalent for a time to
day, active shares declining 2 to 7
points in the first half of the session,
but rallying with surprising ease
later.
There were no developments in ex
planation of the rebound, but from the
hurried buying of the final hour, it
was apparent that the aggressive
short interest deemed it expedient to
cover contracts in the more popular
industrials. The recovery of the last
hour not only wiped out most losses,
but many net gains of 2 to 5 points
were made in one notable instance,
that of United Cigars, the gain being
17 points. Sales amounted to 1,250,000
shares.
Foreign exchange, one ot yester
day's demoralizing factors, was sub
stantially better, especially as to the
British rate which rallied over 3 cents
to the pound with moderate improve

Call money retained much of yester
day's firmness, the initial rates of 5
to 5 per cent being slightly advanced
later.'
Time money was little changed, a 6
per cent rate ruling for all maturities.
An easier tone ruled in the bond
market, the Liberty group, also inter
nationals shading slightly ' with the
general domestic list.
Sales, par value, $11,350,000.
Old U. S. coupons gained 1 point on
sales, the registered rising & to per

THE GRAIN MARKETS
CHICAGO, Aug. 21. Selling pres
sure on the corn market today met
with steady resistance and average
prices were somewhat higher, though
at times the market fell off, particu
larly in mid-sesion. Offerings were
readily absorbed and each decline was
followed by a rally. Corn closed strong
Mc o lc net higher with September
at $1.8434 to $1.S5 and December at
$1.45 to $1.45 Oats closed to c
higher and provisions finished 25c to
55c higher.
Chop reports from the big corn area
in Iowa and Illinois were distinctly
favorable, but failed to materially de
press the corn prices. A recovery of
around 8 points in sterling exchange
over yesterday's low figure was re-

becker of the board to State Engineer
Thomas Maddock. advises that begin
ning September 1st supervisors will
no longer approve payments of b!i
for road work done by the state ifc
Cochise county out of the 75 per cent
road fund, as the board has decideu
,to take over the supervision and di
recting of road matters within Co
chise ccunty after that date. The
following letter advising the stat
engineer of the decision of the C
chie board is self explanatory.
August 19th, 1919.
Hon. Thos. Maddock,
State Engineer,' ; .
Phoenix. Arizona. ;
Dear Sir: j t
uy order or the board of supet-:
visors I have been directed to advlso
you that on and after September 1st,!
1919. this board will no longer ap-
prove nor countenance the payment
of any more bills out of the 75 pei j
cent road tax fund of Cochise county j
as the board desires, to take over thej
supervising and directing of oaa!
matters within this county after the!
above date.
For your information fhe board;
wishes to advise that the reason fori
taking these steps; Is owing to the:
fact that they arenot satisfied wit !
the present existing system; that un-i
der the system, proper results have!
not been forthcoming, and from a!
business standpoint" have been veryi
unsatisfactory. Therefore, not con-,'
ductive to the best methods of ob-;
taining value received in exchange'
for the amounts expended.
The board wishes to be fair and
just in this matter, but feel that for
the best interest of Cochise county,
this change is necessary. .
Yours very truly,
L. F. KUCHENBECKER.
Clerk Board of Supervisors.
