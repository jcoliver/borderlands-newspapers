told the fifteenth district Republican

the republic from the process of na

Denouncing "Democratic vicillation

Senator Poindexter said the Republi

who would fulfill the responsibilities
the nation had assumed in Mexico and
"reassert American honor and self-respect,
so that our citizens, lawfully in
the country, would not be forced to
ransom their lives with money."
"The suggestion now made in some
quarters," he continued, "that Great
Britain should be invited to restore or

false ti our fundamental policies, and
a Republican congress should restore
order in Mexico and adjust on correct
principles its international obliga

I0HIGHT
T O IN
LIQUOR BILL
May Keep Cellar Full After
July I, But Owner Must
Drink It All Up Himself
Can Not Give It Away Or
Transport It, Is Proviso Of
House In Prohibition Bill
WASHINGTON, June 24. A man's
right to store liquor in his home for
the long dry period after July 1, stood
up today against an attack on that
provision of the prohibition enforce
ment bill before the house judiciary
committee.
Near the end of an all day session
the committee voted down an amend
ment which would have made it un
lawful for a citizen to have liquor in
his possession, struck out a section
which would have prevented "use" by
a citizen of liquor in his private
dwelling, and decided in the matter of
general enforcement there would be
no difference between war time and
constitutional prohibition.
Even with these and other chancres
the bill as it will be reported out to
morrow or Thursday is considered as
all-embracing. So drastic are its pro
visions, members of the committee
said, that while a man may put a keg
oi oeer "in his cellar he may be con
victed and fined, if, for instance, he
wears a watch fob on which there is
a picture1 of the keg as an advertise
ment. As amended, the section stands:
"That no person shall on or after
date when the 18th amendment to the
constitution of the United States goes
Into effect, nor while the war prohi
bition act shall be in force, manufac
ture, sell, barter, give away, trans
port, import, export, deliver, furnish,
receive or possess any intoxicating
liquor except as authorized in this act,
and all the provisions of this act shall
be literally construed to the end that
intoxicating liquor as a beverage may
be prohibited. Liquor for non-beverage
purposes and wine for sacramental
purposes may be purchased, sold,
transported and used as herein pro
vided." , Every person legally permitted to
have liquor is required to report to
the proper authorities within ten
days after the passage of the act, and
possession after that date "by any
person not legally permitted under
this title to possess liquors," shall be
regarded as evidence that it is kept
for purposes of sale. This, however,
does not apply to home stocks.
The bill's definition of what Is in
toxicating liquor any beverage or
product containing more than one
half of 1 per cent alcohol was re
tained. It was said that members of
the committee discussed this section
at length, some contending that if
one congress undertake to define in
toxicating liquors as one-half of one
per cent another congress could come
along and make it A per cent, or any
figure it chose.
Pike 's Peak '
Not Tallest
r
Most people, if asked to name
the highest mountain in Colorado,
would say: "Pike's Peak."
Yet there are no less than twenty-six
mountains In Colorado which
are HIGHER.
Pike's Peak Is generally thought
to be the highest because it has
been extensively ADVERTISED.
This story, by John Lee Mahin,
has a moral:
There may be twenty-six stores
in this town equally as good as
yours. . 1
But most folks, if asked to name
the ?'best" store in your line, will
name YOUR store if you adver
tise. Of course you will do all in your
power to justify this confidence.
You will back up your advertising
with quality and service. You will
deliver the goods.
Ypu yourself can name hundreds of
products which are PREFERRED
by the public because the manufac
turer knew what publicity would
do for him.
There's a . hint for you in the
story of Pike's Peak. Think it over
and patronize the columns of the
Bisbee Daily Review, Southern Ari
zona's leading advertising medium.

DANES CHEER ALLIES

COPENHAGEN. June 24. There
was remarkable spontaneous out
break of rejoicing when the news that
Germany had decided to sign the
peace treaty reached Copenhagen.
The guns of the British and French
warships in the roadstead in salvos
announced the news. i
The singing of the Marseillaise and
other patriotic songs was to be heard
everywhere. French and British sai
ors marched to the national Danish
monument commemorating the war
of 1864 and decorated it with flowers.
The populace wildly cheered the
allies who had won Schleswig again
for Denmark. The Copenhagen news
papers today print enthusiastic edi
torial artlcleg.
with the words "Seal of the presi
dent of the United States."
Some of the seals supplied by
the delegates are merely mono
grams unadorned. The French
treaty experts regard the Chinese
and Japanese seals as the most
artistic. These are chiefly the
names of the delegates in oriental
letters and are adorned with
flowers and quaint figures.
The expectation was that
strictly personal seals would be
used, but like President, Wilson,
M. Vandervelde, representing
Belgium, is using an official seal
the Belgian coat of arms encir
cled by the words "Minister of
Justice."
The German delegates will sign
after the allies.
The order in which the allied
delegates will sign after the sig
natures of the president and pre
miers are attached, will be accord
ing to the alphabetical order of
the names of the countries they
represent. When the signatures
are completed, the entente party
will emerge on the terrace at the
side of the palace, where all the
great fountains will be playing in
the gardens. The Germans will
leave on the side where they entered.

Willard and Jack Kearns, manager or
the challenger, and officials of the
Army, Navy and Civilian oBard ot

the problem of Electing a referee.
V. A. Gavin, a member of the exe

Adam Empje, secretary, profess to
believe the situation is not a serious
one and thai the question will be set--tled
within two or three days.
Various reports were current to
night that Willard had declared that
he would accept Rickard as referee
and no one else. Another report was
that Kearns would insist upon either
Jack Wekh of San Francisco or Billy
Brown of New York. Willard is op
posed to the p!an of having two
judges in addition to a referee.
I)einpse was 24 years old today

SENATE SETS ARMY
OF U. S. AT 400,000
(Continued from Page unen
Keilar, Democrat of Tennessee, and
Reed, criticized the manner in which
war materials were being disposed of
by the government, and especially the
Burplus supply of meats, estimated to
be worth $65,000,000. Senator Mc Kei
lar called attention to a newspaper
item, which said all bids lor this meat
had been rejected because they were
too low and charged that the packers
were being especially favored by the
war department in the disposal of this
meat. He asserted that Mr. Hare "is
the only man, in the United States
that can be found who says this meat
must not be sold so that the people
cannot get the benefit, but that it
must be put on the market so that
only the packers can get it."
Chairman Wadsworth asserted If
this meat were sold in smaller quan
tities or if the government were com
pelled to open stores for the purpose
of retailing it, that a much larger ap
propriation would be required. He
said the application for bids had been
sent to 40,000 retail dealers and others
by the war department.
"1 cannot see," he added, "that any
body is criminally negligent in this
matter.
Senator Reed criticized the sale or
$20,00 worth of airplanes for
$,000,000 by the war department, and
said he thought some explanation of
the matter should be made.
The senate also accepted the com

BOLOGNA, June 24. (By The As
sociated Press) Fighting for acquit
tal, Alfred Cocchi, charged with the
murder of Ruth Cruger in New York,
in 1917, presented to the court and
jury' a vivid description of killing of
the girl. He contended that his wife
was the guilty one. He explained
that he had made his former confes
sion for her protection, but declared
that, now she had abandoned him, he
would tell the truth.
Cocchi said: "I was talking to the
signorina. My wife struck her on the
back of the head with one of my
tools. It was not I who struck thq
fatal blow; it was my wife. I hid
the body to protect my wife."
To this Signor Bagnoli, president
of the court, retorted:
"But the American officials say you
have exonerated your wife."
- Cocchi answered:
"It is impossible for anybody to
call her innocent. Nobody could have
an opinion on the affair unless he
were there to see it."

This Is . a Matter
When the influenza epidemic was at its worst in this country con
siderable effort was put forth in "fighting the flu." But no one, not
even the most learned of our physicians, got intimately acquainted with
the flu germ. More or less guessing was done along preventative lines
and in the treatment of patients.
The result: 500,000 deaths!
Influenza rages in autumn, winter and early spring.
Another epidemic may come with cooler weather. Another WILL,
come some time if we have not learned how to prevent its coming.
To prevent its coming we must study the subject more thoroughly than
we were able to do while striken with the dread disease. And the best
time to do this studying Is NOW.
A year's delay may harvest another 500,000 deaths, or MORE.
The American Medical 'Association has asked congress to contribute
$1,500,000 to an investigation of the influenza epidemic in an attempt to
determine its cause and to isolate the influenza germ.
This is but a cent and a half from each person in the country. Is
" there ANY person not willing to give that much toward ending the in
fluenza danger for all time? '
Congress immediately should appropriate the million and a hair,
and direct the U. S. Public Health Service to begin its investigation in
conjunction with the American Medical Association and to continue this
highly important work until the germ has been found and its methods
of attack analyzed. Preventative and curative campaigns then may be
more intelligently planned, and will be more successful than were our
efforts during the course of the last epidemic.
To do this, and to do it quickly, is a matter of public concern, ane
therefore, it is a matter for public financing.
A Gieat Day Coming
Listen, all you brass rail hounds who will soon be without the ol
familiar friendly spot In which to rest a foot while you settle the affairs
of the world with ther bar lingerers, there are many things you'll have
to learn soon and you might as well start right now as after the first
of July.
To begin with, what 'is a "Sweetheart Rosebud?" What is a "Sun
burst Surprise?" What is a "frosted chocolate with a dash of vanilla?'
There, there, don't be astonished because you don't know there are
plenty of folks on the other hand, who aren't familiar with your own
favorite "clover clubs" and "bronxes."
First of all, a "Sweetheart Rosebud" is one of those things that make

Engineer C. W. Millenhas laid off his
surveying crew as the work is prac.
tically all done with the exception
of what Mr. Miller will do personally
on the remaining work. One of the

COMFORTING SUMMER
THOUGHT FROM PHOENIX
PHOENIX, June 24. Although it is
the common belief that it is a great
deal better out in the Arizona sunshine
than it is in the shade of a cotton
wood or some other tree, an experi
ment conducted by James R. Gordon
of the local weather bureau proves
that there is not a great difference.
Gordon took a thermomter that had
been hanging in the shade and regis
tered 108 degrees, and held it in the
sun. The mercury rose to 110 de
grees and there it stood. In speaking
of the experiment, the weather ob
server explained that if the same
thermometer had been placed on a
wall in the sun where it got the re
fracted rays of the sun, the mercury
would rise to a much higher degree.
DEVELOPMENT CAMPAIGN
PATAGONIA. June 24. It is under
stood that as a result of the examina
tion made last week of the Sweet
shaft of the old Mansfield company
by H. B. Richmond, proessor of geo
logy' of William Jewell College of Li
berty, Mo., a campaign of develop
ment will be inaugurated on this
property, now owned by the Southern
Arizona Mining company, with head
quarters at Kansas City, Mo. It Is
proposed to unwater the Sweet shaft,
now down 360 feet, and continue de
velopment work. All of the necea
sary equipment is now on the ground
at this property for the continuation
of the work.
WHO GETS THE BEE SALARY?
PHOENIX, June 24. Who is en
titled to the salary of the state bee
inspector? J. P. Ivy, who claims ap
proximately $1,000 for services dur
ing the year 1917, or Peder Benson,
who claims the same amount as bee
inspector for 1918, when there is only
$1,300 in the fund?
.Is there another fund from which
to draw besides the one which falls
short of paying both inspectors?
These are questions the court will
determine in a few days .according
to the statement made after the tak
ing of evidence yesterday. Judge
Stanford announced that he would
hear arguments this week and would
then dispose of the matter.
Some months ago Ivy brought man
damus proceedings against Jesse L.
Boyce, state auditor to compel the
auditor to pay his (Ivy's) salary as
bee inspector. Benson then instituted
court action against Ivy and Eoyce
and the attorney general then came
in the suit a sinterpleader.
STATE AGRICULTURAL
COMMISSION ORGANIZED
PHOENIX, June 24. The agricul

was organized yesterday at the capi

bell; E. W. Hudson of Tempo and A.
Y. Greer of Yuma were in conference

The new commission is considered
well balanced as representing the in.
terests they will have in charge. Kim
ball comes from the deciduous fruit

is the selection of the long staple
cotton growers and citrus fruit inter
ests to represent them. Greer is presi
dent o the Yuma Water Users' asso
ciation and is qualified to represent
tho short staple growers and the cit.
rus fruit industry of that section.

WINSLOW TEACHER RAN AWAY
WITH ANOTHER'S WIFE
WINSLOW, June 24. Two weeks
ago it was announced that the school
board had employed one Lieut. L. V.
Lewis, of Logan, West. Virginia, as
commercial teacher and military in
structor, but last week the long arm
of the federal government reached
out and cancelled the engagement,
and, Lieut. Lewis is now speeding on
his way back to Logan in charge of a
deputy U. S. marshal. It is alleged
from information gleaned from tele
grams and letters received here that
when Lewis started for Arizona to
qualify for his job with the Winslow
school board, his mind must have
slipped a cog as he brought another
man's wife with him instead of his
owni The husband of the woman did
not view the situation with a kindly
eye, it is said, and laid his troubles
before the federal authorities, and a
warrant was issued charging the
lieutenant-professor with a violation
of the Mann act. Deputy U. S. Marsh
al Weage, of Phoenix, arrived and
Sunday evening departed with . his
man for Tucson for a hearing. Lewis
will be taken back to his old home
town.
CONDUCT OF COCHISE
ROAD ISSUE OPPOSED
BY SULPHUR SPRINGS
(Tucson Citizen)
At a recent meeting of the people
of Sulphur Springs valley held in the
Double Adobe district, it was the
sense of the meeting that the board
of supervisors were trying to put
something over on the taxpayers of
Cochise county and that so far as
they were concerned they were op
posed to the $1,200,000 bond issue a3
proposed by Roberts and Adams.
General discussion covered the legal
ity of the No. 2 commision and having
employed eminent council in the per
son of W. G. Gilmore of Tombstone
the people assembled were of the
opinion that spending the taxpayers'
money for advice and not getting it
was unfair and tended to place com
mission No. 2 in a ridiculous position
before the public. Why are Roberts
and Adams keeping Gilmore's opinion
to themselves?.

TELLS HOW U. S. ROUTED VILLA
JUAREZ, Mexico, June 24. How
American troops scatered the Villa
rebels, forced them to walk barefoot
ed over the white sands of northern
Chihuahua and destroyed their mo.
rale, was told to General Francisco
Gonzales at military headquarters
here late today by Villa's telegraph
operator, who escaped at Villa Ahu
mada and reached here today. This
man- is a military prisoner here and
his name is withheld.
He said Villa's men were scattered
over the country between Ramalayuca
and Villa Ahumada after the pursuit
of the rebels by Colonel James J.
Hornbrook'9 cavalry, their horses
were ridden down and abandoned in
the sand wastes, men dropped from
their saddles and died on the desert
from wounds or exhaustion, and
wounded officers and men suffered
alike for lack of medical attention
and surgical dresings.
Villa Generals Shot
The telegraph operator was im
pressed by Villa at Coyame. Chihua
hua, last September, he said, and had
been forced to accompany the rebel
leader throughout his operations in
the north. He was stationed with
Villa's staff during the battle of
Juarez and told General Gonzales
many details of the battle which had
been unknown here. He said Nico
las Fernandez, one of Villa's leading
generals was shot in the right arm
Sunday night and went until Mon
day nisht without medical attention.
Ildefonso Sanchez, another Villa gen
eral, was shot in the foot. Martin
Lopez's command of 500 was reduced
to 200 by the fighting in Juarez and
the shrapnel shells of the American
artillery near the race track, the man
declared.
He said the Villa headquarters staff
reached Samalayuca, 30 miles souta
of Juarez, at 4 o'clock the Monday
afternoon after the crossing of the
American expedition and that Colonel
Hornbook's men were at San Jose, a
short distance north, when the pur
suit was abandoned. He said he saw
General Felipe Angeles supervising a
band of rebels tearing up the railroad
track at Samalayuca to hamper pur
suit by federals or Americans. He
said Villa's own bodyguard then had
less than 125 rounds of ammunition
per man while many of the troops had
none.
The telegraph operator said he left
Villa Ahumada late Friday after Vil
la's toutposts reported the approach
of General Quiroga's federal cavalry,
which engaged the Villa forces Sat
urday, driving them from the town,
kililng 63 and wounding many more,
according to General Quiroga's offi
cial dispatch to General Gonazles.
The operator left before the battle
started.
Colonel Martinez, a Villa officer,
wounded during the Juarez battle and
hidden in a house in the Juarez val
ley, sent a courier to General Gon
zales late last night saying he was
dying and wished to give important
military information to the general
before he died. General Gonzales
hurried there in his automobile but
the Villa officer died before he could
make a statement.
HEAD NON-PARTISAN
LEAGUE ON TRIAL ON
CHARGE OF-SEDITION
JACKSON, Minn., June 24. A jury
of twelve farmers was obtained in
Jackson county district court late to
day to try President A. C. Townley of
the non-partisan league, and Joseph
Gilbert, a former organizer for the
league, on the charge of conspiracy to
teach disloyalty.
Selection of the jury began this
morning and only a few men on the
panel were challenged or dismissed
for cause.
None of the jurors live in Jac kson.
Attorneys for the prosecution, as
well as the defense ,asked the jury
men as to whether any friend or ac
quaintances had "sounded them out"
regarding their views, prior to or
since the case was called for trial.
Ixuis Bachman, a prospective
juror, declared shortly after the after
noon session opened he told a barber
at noon he thought it would be diffi
cult to get a jury because "the all
are prejudiced against the Non-Partisan
league." He was excused.
Bachman made this statement after
Attorney Hoke, chief counsel for
Townley, asked Bachman, who was on
the stand, whether he had discussed
the case while in a barber shop here j
at noon.
Hoke told Judge C. E. Dean, after
Bachman was excused, that the infor
mation came to him at noon.
"It looked as if someone was try-
ing to draw out the jurymen," said
the,' judge to Bachman, after calling
his attention to the fact that just be-
I 'ore the noon recess he had urged the
us-Nurors ?iruI 'he, prospective jurors not
to: discuss the cast; with'anyono.

NEW YORK, June 24. Elimination of

THE GRAIN MARKETS
CHICAGO, June 24. Acute weak
ness in the corn market today resulted
largely from general belief that bul
lish effects of peace had been -well
discounted in advance. After a fall or
about 6 cents from yesterday's top, the
market closed nervous, 3c to 4c net
lower, -with September $1.74 to
$1.74 and December $1.52 to
$1.52. Oats lost 2c to 2c and pro
visions 15c to 77c.
Sharpest breaks in corn prices oc
curred after midday when liquidating
sales by holders broadened out and
the fact was evident that the market
lacked the rallying power which had
been conspicuous of late. Opinion
that the climax of eleventh 4iour peace
buying was reached prevailed yester
day, and though a reaction was due.
continued from the opening and be
came more pronounced, prices giving
way further at the beginning of. the
last hour.
A contributing reason was a pro
nounced drop in hog quotations.
Weather conditions were the right sort
for the growth of the new corn crop.
Oats tumbled with corn. Omaha
packers led the selling.
Weakness was the rule to in pro
visions .owing to the downward course
of grain and hogs. The lard market
was weak. .
