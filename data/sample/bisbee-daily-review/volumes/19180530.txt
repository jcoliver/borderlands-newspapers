An enoimou; number of light ma

Tales ot lawlessness in the south

in an official bulletin. "But so far as
the I. W. W. miners are concerned it

This r nd numerous other declara
tions against the draft, against Liberty

"America needs 750,000 men in this
country right now to put down rebel

asserted in an impassioned anti-war
speech at a meeting in Wichita Falls,
Texas. August 21. Clark also drew a
lurid picture of the I. W. W. faking
over the government, according to tes-
timony.

"Whei the socialists clasp hands

Clark was quoted by the government
witnesses as having informed Texas
crowds at street meetings "the social

throughout the world."
Clark warned the people against the
purchase of Liberty loan bonds, de
claring the I. W. W. after the war
would repudiate all such debts.

WILSON APPEALS
FOR MORE THRIFT
CTly Review I.-nw1 Wire)
WASHINGTON, May 29 To save
materials and labor for necessary war
purposes President Wilson today ap
pealed to Americans "to buy only
those things which are essential to
the individual health and efficiency"
and to volunteer on or before June 28,
Netional Thrift Day, to invest sys
tematically in war savings and thrirt
stamps, or other government securi
ties. "This war is one of nations not one
of armies," the president said, "and all
of our 100,000,000 people must be econ
omically and industrially adjusted to
war conditions if this nation is to play
its full part in the conflict. The prob
lem before us is nt primarly a finan
cial problem but rather a problem of
increased production of war essentials
and the saving ot the materials and
the labor necessary for the support
and equipment of our army and navy.
Thoughtless expenditure of money for
non-essentials uses up the labor cf
men, the products of the farm, mines
and factories and overburdens trans
portation, all of which must be used
to the utmost and at their best for war
purposes.
Everyone Must Assist
"The great participation can be ob
tained only by the participation of
every member of the nation, youns
and old, in a national concerted thrift
movement. I therefore urge that our
people everywhere pledge themselves
as suggested by the secretary of the
treasury to the practice of thrift, to
serve the government to their utmost
in increasing production in all fields
necessary to the winning of the war:
to conserve food and fuel and useful
materials of every kind; to devote
their labor only to the most necessary
tasks, and to buy only those things
which are essential to individual
health and efficiency; and that the
people, as evidence of their loyalty,
invest all they can save in Liberty
bonds, and war savings stamps.
"The securities isued by the treas
ury department are so many of them
within the reach of every one that the
door of opportunity in this matter is
wide open to all of us. To practice
thrift in peace times is a virtue' and
brines great benefit to the individual
at all times; with the desperate need
of the civilized world today for mate
rials and labor with which to end tin
war, the practice of individual thrift
is a patriotic duty and a necessity.
Appeals to Nation
"I apeal to all who now own either
Liberty bonds or war savings stamps
to continue to practice economy and
thrift and to appeal to all who do not
of their means.
The man who buys
government securities transfers the
purchasing power of his money to the
I'nited States government until after
this war and to that same degree dos
not buy in competition with the gov
ernment. "I earnestly appeal to every man.
uomm nml rtiilil tn nledee themselves
oh or before the 2Sth of June to save
constantly and to buy as regularly as
possible the securities of the govern

SAYS BARON GOTO
Japanese Minister Declares
Entente Has Made No For

j Interference by Nipon.
iBy Review I.ensed Wire)
LONDON. .May 29. The Daily Mail
today publishes from its Tokio corre
spondent an interview with the Jaj
anese foreign minister. Baron Shimpti
Goto, whic h is) remarkable for its dis
cussion by question! and answer of
.lat-Hn's good taith toward the allies
and of the pro-Germanism attributed
to Baron Goto in some quarters. The
interview is mainly concerned with the
prospects of Japanese intervention in
Siberia.
Baron Goto said the allies had m-ide
no formal proposal to Japan for such
intervention, but that any suggestions
by the allies would receive sympa
thetic consideration. .Asked what com
pensation Japan would demand Tor in
tervention. Baron Goto replied that
this Would depend on varying circum
stances size of the army, the extent
of the theaters of operations and th
like.
Allied Cause Comes First
"But at the present moment," the
foreign minister t-aid. "we are not
thinking of compensation, but only
i of everything for the allied cause,
which we have faithfully made our
own."
Concerning the relations of Japan
with the United States, Baron Goto
said that since the steel difficulty had
been settled, Japan no longer had any
cjnjsefrcj)mjiuiint:.- .
Questioned concerning the Japanese
politicians who. the correspondent
said, appeared to regret that Japa.i
was not allied with Germany, Baron
Goto said:
"I do not say that there are nof such
men among us. bu temporary political
partisanship should not be mistaken
for solid convictions. The British peo
ple may rest assured that so Ion,? as
the Japanese empire exists the Jap
anese are their good friends."
Coming to the question of accusa
tions of his alleged pro-Germanism,
Baron Goto spoke as follows.
"I 'stayed in Germany for many
years and studied there, and people
may think me pro-German. I am not
pro-German at all. I am not anti
English. I am Japanese sharing the
national views regarding our interna
tional relationship."
Emphasizing this point. Baron Goto
insisted that it was impossible that
he could be pro-German because "'Ger
many is an enemy But he declined
to discuss what he described as the
meaningless question whether he be
lieved in the permanency of the Anglo
Japanese alliance.
In reply to a question concerning
.'nlleitations that Japan was in th;
fight only for materialistic ends, the-1
foreign minister said:
"Japan had no particular reason to j laborers, pre desired fcr the spruce di
go to war with Germany. She came vision. When this divi- i-m h:i been
in. in obedience to obligations of the!
Aunu-japanrac auwinc ,u nrcp i'" - -
faith. The fac ts are there to justify
us.
Baron Goto expressed the fear that
the war might be protracted, but he;
was confident of an allied victory.
He said the allies never had asked
Japan to send troops to the western
front.

Memorial Day j
At first Memorial Day was devoted to
the decoration of the graves of Northern
soldiers who had fought on the side of the
Union in the Civil War. But Americans
were too big and broad to hold a sectional
holiday and call it national, and within a
few years the graves of Confederate as well
as Union soldiers were' decorated generally
on Memorial Day. About this time the
famous "Blue and Gray" poem was print
ed. "Under the sod and the dew,
Waiting the judgement day;
Under the laurel the blue,
Under the willow the gray."
And then came the Spanish war, and
after that Memorial day came in deed and
in truth to be a national day. But this year
with the great world war raging, and two
million Americans under arms, and two
million more to be called before this time
next year, Memorial Day has come to be a
day of days in America. And no longer
will it be only a day of blossoms and the
parade to the white city beyond the town
where the green mounds mark the earthly
end of man. Alas, our soldier dead in this
war sleep in ihe famous fields of France.
The ocean waves roll between them and
these home shores. Therefore, the da)' has
come to be one of prayer; has come to be
a day of thought and pride and sorrow
mingled. Ah, by all means let U3 cut the
blossoms and bear them in our hands to
the graves of those we love. And there,
with bended knee and uplifted face, let us '
breathe a prayer for a soldier boy in France
and dedicate to him a blossom.
Whether he be the quick or the dead, it
matters not on this day. It is the Soldier
Day. A day of memorial for the living as
well as the dead. A memorial for all ab
sent ones who brave dangers in a far land
for their country's cause. A prayer, a tear,
a fond hope and a token.
Every winter the flowers die and every
returning spring they bud and blcom
again as a token of the resurrection. Hence
we plant and place them on the graves of
foved ones gone before. "Somewhere in
France a lily close by an English rose,"
thus goes the song. And the Scotch thistle
and the Irish shamrock are there, too. Yes,
and the American Beauty rose. So let us
all gather a blossom today and carry it to a
hallowed spot, or wear it in token of a
memory, or press it to our lips as a beauti
ful bud of hope that some one will come
back again.
Soldiers' Day. Let us thank God that
this nation still breeds brave men who will
give and do and die for a cause. This is
their day. Their very own' For, though
these boys in khaki who march and fight
and mount guard today, some of them may
not die for forty years, but for every one of
them this is a day apart and will some time
be devoted to one and all who wore their
country's livery upon honor's field.
Let us also thank God today for our close
union of heart and hand in a common
cause. Never a day since the Boston Tea
Party has the dawn witnessed such close
communion of every class and race and
condition of American citizenship in a
noble endeavor that has for its ultimate
aim the good of all as it witnesses this day.
The Warren District Commercial Club
is to be congratulated upon its stand taken
in the matter of refusing to deal with Gov
ernor Hunt in securing the bit of wool bid
in by Bisbee for a Red Cross prize direct
from the hand of President Wilson. Why
should Bisbee or any of her citizens have
anything to do with a governor who has
declared war upon this patriotic and loyal
community? He has maligned and abused
and miscalled this town in most vicious
fashion, all because we broke up an organ
ized I. W. W. effort to cripple our copper
industry in time of war. We cannot stoop
to bandy epithets or match loyalty with
him, but we can ignore him in our dealings
with the government as a loyal city. We
have won a governmental war prize in di
rect competition with every other city in
the state. Well, we will have it direct from
the government without passing through
hands raised against us. To paraphrase
our old friend Scott:
"Hands that have the Wobblies grasped,
Never shall in friendly clasp
Hold hands with Bisbee town."
Airplanes at last ! A special correspond
ent for a newspaper that has all along bit
terly attacked the government for the fail
ure of its air program, conies through
clean and declares that production at the
Dayton, Ohio, factory has now reached
a tptal of seven planes and over a day, and
over one hundred two-seated battle and
bombing planes have been delivered in
France. The Dayton plant manufactures
a plane known as the DeHavilahd, driven
by the Liberty motor, and it has the class
of anything in Europe. Another American
plant is making planes at the rate of thirty
a day and two other plants have a capacity
right now of ten each. By August this
correspondent declares, after personal in
vestigation, we will have over two thou
sand planes in France. When it is consid
ered that at no time during the war has
either side been able to muster over twenty
five hundred planes, it will be understood
what two thousand American planes will
mean to the allies, who already have the
mastery cf the air to a marked extent.
Allied bombing operations have been a
vjtal factor the past few "weeks in off
setting German masses of troops and ar
tillery. With two thousand fresh planes
added, this preponderance will become ab
solutely vital in its effect upon the 1918
campaign.
By massing heavy forces in sectors along
the line that had been quiet lately, the Ger
mans succeeded in making considerable
advance in the Rheims sector and in maul
ing the thin lines of French and British
troops oui!:e severely. No use disguising
the fact. However, when reserves came
up ihe advance was stopped. If the Ger-(
mans have really taken Chemin des Dairies
and can held it, this is a hard blow. The
advantage always lies with the offensive
forces, for they can mass troops at a given
spot and win initial successes if they care
to pay for them. These reverses and these
critical periods for the safety of the allied
lines may be expected to continue through
the year and until such time as the balance
of power in the matter of men and artillery
swings from the German to the allied side
of the battle front. And this will not be
until America gets into the game with
somewhere near her proportionate share of
strength.
The Americans showed the Prussians in
the Montdidier sector Tuesday that they
could fight a little. They repulsed a savage
attack with several losses and then took the
village of Cantigny by a brilliant stroke.
And as this war grows older and more
deadly still the Germans will learn to the
bitter end the lesson of just how well and
how hard the Americans can fight. Our
first village Cantigny. The name will
become a classic in American history, head
ing the list of a large number of captured
villages, and at the beginning of this list
will appear towns with French names, and
towards the bottom will appear towns with
German names. What!
It is not only a sign of bad citizenship
and viciousness and ignorance to curse the
Red Cross these days in America, but it is
dangerous as well. A man in Flint, Michi
gan, cursed this organization the other day
and refused to subscribe a cent to its work
and aims, and he was ducked in a pond and
then painted yellow and led through the
streets and chained to a post in the public
square while the Red Cross held a meeting
nearby.
This special session of the legislature
seems to have been called to debate and
take a stand for or against the Ik W. W.
instead of to merely consider war meas
ures. And, by all the gods of war and
freemod! while Hunt called these legisla
tors, he does not seems to be able to
lead them far enough to take a stand
in favor of these enemies of all govern
ment whatever.
Douglas International: Regardless of the
fact that all the producing mining com
panies in Arizona are today under the con
trol of the government, both as to the price
of their copper product and conditions con
trolling the employment of labor, they are
classed as conscienceless profiteers by the
rearing and roaring executive.

Our thoughts today are turned to you.
Our Honored Dead,
Who by your death gave to your coun
try, life. (
Beyond our touch vour bodies lie In
hallowed graves.
Yet never was your presence nearer
nor your spirit stronger upon us.
We feel the throb of your blood the
mighty pulsation
Of that giant artery of Freedom which
stretches from Lexington and Val
ley Forge
To those who now rest in the shadow
of the Scottish cliffs
And under the sacred soil of the once
fair fields of France.
Our hearts are quickened and our
br?astt grow warm with the fire
of Liberty,
That holy fire kindled by your hands,
nourished by your sacrifice
And by our memory ever kept aglow
within us
From you we gather strength that In
this World Struggle
We shall prove true to the heritage
ycu have given us
That we may not falter in this, the
Battle for Greater Freedom,
The Freedom of Humanity.

BY REVIEW
NEW YORK. May 29 Taking the:
impending holiday with its many pos-
sibilities regarding the foreign situa-
tion into account, traders proceeded
warily in today's stock market
Irresularity at the outset was smv
ceeded by general strength which in
dustries snared in variable degree
with equipments, coppers, shippings,
Oils, motors, fertilizers and numerous
miscelaneous offerings.
Utilities were at all times heavy.
Gross advances ranged from 14 to 3
points in transcontinental. Heading,
St. Paul, New Haven and New York
Central. .
Profit taking and intermittent short
offerings ensued 011 publication of the
adverse French war bulletin after mid
day, causing reactions which cancelled
the greater part of the morning's gains
in industrials and equipments, rail3
also forfeiting much of their advant
age. Sales 725,000 shares.
All the Liberty issues, 3Vs's except
ed, made new low records, the first
fours at f94.06. second fours at i.u,
and 4'i's at $97 06. The general bond
list was Irregular. Total sales, par
value, $5,875,000.
United States bonds, old issues,
were unchanged on call.
GRAINS
CHICAGO, May 29. Lowest prices
yet this season resulted in the corn
market today from prospects of bump
er new crops of virtually everything
but corn.-
The finish was unsettled to 14 to
1 cents down, with June J1.33V4 and
July $1.35 to $1.35',. Oats closed un
changed to cent higher. The out
come in provisions varied from 6')
cents decline to a rise of 5 cents.
Indications of a. period of higher
temperateres and of fair weather de
sirable at present for corn growth
added in a material degree to bearish
sentiments based largely on the excel
lent general crop outlook and on re
ports of big country supplies of coarse
grain. Month end evening up of busi
ness in the May option gave an ap
pearance of relative firmness to oats.
Provisions as a rule finally weak
ened in consequence of lower values
on hogs.

GUILTY OF MURDER
tliy Review Leased Wire)
'AUKESHA, Wis., May 29. Gra. c
Lusk was found guilty here tonight oi
second degree murder for the killing
of. Mrs. Mary Newman Roberts.
When the verdict was delivered
Mihs Lusk attempted to choke D. S.
Tirtlar, acting district attorney, but
was -overpowered and led screaming
rom the court room.
"It's a lie! It's a lie against me!
Me lied:" she screamed as she sprung
at the throat of the prosecutor.
Miss Lusk Collapses
The veroict carries imprisonment
from fourteen to twenty-live years.
Miss Lusk collapsed when the jury re
tired and her condition became sucu
on returning to the jail that it re
quited neany hall an nour to return
ner to the court house when the jury
lepcrted a verdict.
The jury deliberated four hoars. The
case went to the jury at 5:27 this
evening.
Walter D. Corrigan. for the prose
cution, and James Clancey, for tne de
lense, delivered the closing arguments
Mr. Corrigan in demanding the niaii
nium penalty, declared that neither Dr.
Lavid Roberts or Miss lusk was on
trial for their relationship and that
the only question to be decided was
responsibility for the death of an in
nocent women. He declared a motie
was given in the letters the school
teacher had written where she ha:l
referred to the "elimination" ot the
third party in the triangle and to her
desire to replace Mrs. Roberts on the
"thione" she occupied as the doctor's
wife.
Reads Girl's Note
Mr. Corrigan argued that the words
and actions of the defendant proves
her sane at the time of the shooting.
He lead the note she wrote immediate
ly after the tragedy in which she said:
"May God forgive men," and to her
statement four days later to three
witnesses that she realized what she
had done, but could not understand
how she did it so "calmly and delib
erately." Mr. Clancey cited the stories tol t
on the witness stand by both Miss
Lusk and Dr. Roberts ai the best
proof that the defendant was insane,
arguing that a woman of her admitted
social and educational attainments
would be incapable of the things re
vealed ir she were sane. He referred
to the mental taint in her family and
nervous breakdown as proving the tes
timony given by five alienists for ihe
defense that she was suffering from
paranoia.
Hitry o' Cass
Miss Lusk listened to the closing
sraument statement with hardiy a
trace of emotion but broke down com
jdetely after the rase had gone to
the jury.
Mrs. Roberts was shot and killed by
Miss Lusk in the latter's home the af
