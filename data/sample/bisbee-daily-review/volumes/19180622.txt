NORTHERN ITALY, June 21. (By
the Associated Press.) Fresh
rains have turned the Piave river
into a swirling yellow flood, which
moves silently but swiftly, dealing
a fateful blow to the Austrians t-i
its western bank, tearing up the
communicating lines and prevent
ing succor being given the shat
tered divisions struggling under
the steady pounding of the Italian
una of the Duke of Aosta's third
army.
The satisfaction of the Italians over
the present situation is matched only
by the anger of the Austrian command.
According to prisoners the swollen riv
er has been the culmination of a series
of difficulties which prevented the Au
strians from making headway either
on the Monlello plateau or that section
of the country lying between the Tre-viso-Mestre
and the San Dona Di
( Piave-Mestre railway lines, where the
fighting it-1 been hard anil j.ruei a'!
the week, with the Austrian surely
pressed at every point and harrassed
on both sides of the river by the Ital
ian small guns and also huge pieces
belonging to the navy mounted on
floats, which move about the water
way at will.
It is considered only a question of
a brief time before the Austrians will
begin another offensive. It is said
this time they probably will concen
trate their efforts, instead of scatter
ing them as they did a week ago when
they followed the German plan of at
tempting to make & oig general offen
sive over a long line before revealing
their point of attack.
It is thought that the plan was
dictated by General Ludendorff. the
German commaiider, who did not real
ize that tne Austrians were too weak
to make such an attempt, as they not
only lack artillery but local officers
of the lower grade.
The presence of Emperor Charles on
the Italian front is considered one of
the signs leading to the belief that
the Austrian will feel the necessity of
renewing their attack.

JERRY OTEARY
PERMiHED TO
READ IN LETTER
(By Ilovlew leased Wire)
XKW VOItK, June 2 i. -Documentary
evidence intended to strengthen
Jeremiah O'Leary's claim that the fed
eral authorities Intended to "frame"'
him in connection with activities ot
enemy agents prior to his flight from
justice last month, was introdu'a
by the defense today at the trial of
his brother, John J. O'Leary, wv !i
alleged to have aided in the escape.
This evidence was presented at tiie
termination of Jeremiah's two days
tiucstioning by his brother's lawyer,
r.nd Earl 15. Barnes, assistant district
attorney. It consisted of a letter pur
porting to have been written by Henry
A. Wise, a Xew York Lawyer, to Join
J. O'Leary, announcing his decision
to withdraw from Jeremiah O'Leary'3
defense against accusations of pub
lishing seditious magazine articles, be
cause, the letter read, "the officers of
our government are so bitter, if I
should defend your brother in this
case they would probably treat me as
they have treated General Wood and
refuse to accept my offer of service."
The letter explained that Wise had
had military training and that he in
tended to offer his services to the 30
ernment. He said a commission might
be refused him if he did not with
draw. ,
The letter was admitted with the
understanding that Mr. Wise would
be permitted to explain it during a
later session.

featured Philadelphia's victory over
Boston today. The visitors got away
to a three run lead, but Cravath's
home run with Luderus on base tied
the score and in the fifth inning
Stock's circuit drive, also with a man

ninth, after Powell doubled, Main hit
a batsman and passed three and
Oeschger was called to the rescue. A

RODEO'S
FOURTH
OLD
FASHIONED
CELEBRATION
When Rodeo plans a pood time for
her residents and their visitors, few
jilaces many times as lar.i:e can ex
ceed her in extending gracious hospi
tality. When Rodno announces that
she intends to hold a Fourth of July
celebration, no one doubts that it
will be a "plumb good one" as they
say in the cow country.
Apparently the little town near the
New Mexico-Arizona border will make
the most ambitious effort of any place
in the southwest to have an unalloyed
day of pleasure. There will be races
for boys, girls and men. all sorts of
races, including sack and potato speed
contests. A tug of war and a water
melon eating contest also are on ine
program.
The feature of the day, and the
event which interests Bisbee people
most greatly, will be the motorcycle
race from Douglas to Rodeo. The
racers will leave the Gadsden at 9 a.
m. and immediately after their arrival
at the finish line, the program of en
tertainment stunts will be started. A
number of Bistee speed fiends are
flirting with the race and intend to
enter and try to bring home the long
end of the purse.
There will be dancing, day and night
with a big prize waltz in the evening
to attract the lovers of the graceful
art.
None need fear starvation, for the
committee has announced with an em
phasis indicating that they mean it,
that there will bo plenty to eat and
drink.
BURNS CAUSE DEATH
Mrs. Dr. Lattimer. daughter of Mr.
and Mrs. Don A. Sanford, pioneer
Tucsonans. suffered burns from which
she died while on an outing in Virginia
on June 4, according to advices re
ceived by Mrs. Owen T. Rous of
this city. Mrs. Lattimer was a mem
ber of an outing party, traveling by
boat. On the evening of June 4 she
was preparing supper over an oil stove
when it exploded and she received
burns so severe that she died the fol
lowing morning at Fredericksburg, Va ,
in a hospital, to which she was re
moved following the explosion. Mrs.
Lattimer's parents were pioneers of
this section of Arizona and there are
many Tucsonans who remember them
well and fondly. The family lived In
Tucson until 1885, when they moved
to Washington, D. C.

BY REVIEW
NEW YORK, June 21. Trading on
the stock exchange today was marked
by alternate advances and declines,
the latter tendency prevailing at the
dull close.
Forenoon gains of one to three
posits among various speculative Is
sues also experienced a sharp revers
al before the close and standard stocks
eased from fractions to m points. No
definite explanation of the setback
wss forthcoming.
Rails also lagged, the only note
worthy movement in that group ts
ing limited to secondary coalers.
Tobaccos, oils, and utilities dis
played little of their recent promi
nence and motors yielded moderately
with metals. Sales amounted to 573,
000 shares.
Liberty issues again featured the
uncertain bond market, trading in the
international division reflecting no
pronounced trend. Total sales, per
value, aggregated $6,775,000.
Old United States bonds were, un
changed on call.
GRAIN
CHICAGO. June 21. Bears over
reached themselves in the corn market
todav by too great stress on the ideal
weather. After a material break, the
prices made a sharp turn and closed
firm, to 1 cents net higher, with
July 11.43 to 1.44 and August, fl.461,
to $1.46?;. Oats finished at cents
to cent advance. Provisions gained
30 to 65.
An advance at Winnipeg had must
to do with rallying oats from weak
ness that had been due largely to im
proved weather. Houses with sea
board connections were good buyers
at the last.
Reports of better cash inquiry tend
ed to hoist provisions.

them. Keep their clips full of cartridges. , And shoes on their feet.
Boys, get out and sell W. S. S. and send our soldiers over the
top with the go-get-em feeling that comes from knowing you will

WHEELER AGAIN ASSUMES
RESPONSIBILITY ,
' (From the Douglas International)
The telegram cabled from France to the
Bisbee Review by Harry C. Wheeler, who
resigned the office of sheriff in this county
to go .to France with the American army,
receiving a commission as captain, is an
expression that further proves the former
sheriff to be a man of courage and de
termination to do that which he believes
to be his duty regardless of consequences
to himself. He wires to say that he assumes
all responsibility for the deportation which
occurred in Bishkek on July 12, last year;
this he did at the time the deportation
occurred and at all times before leaving for
France as captain in the United States
army. When the United States labor com
mission visited Bisbee, Sheriff Wheeler in a
lengthy letter addressed to Secretary Wil
son fully explained the causes which led
him to form an organization of duties to
.drive the disloyal I. W. W. and those who
upheld them from the Warren district. It
was the desire of Mr. Wheeler, according to
his testimony before this commission to
protect the men who were 'at work in the
mines and who were being harassed and
threatened daily by the I. W. W. pickets.
Captain Wheeler was the leader of the
men who were so severely denounced as
the most contemptible of beings by Gover
nor Hunt in his message to the special ses
sion of the legislature and we cannot but
believe that Wheeler had the governor and
his message in mind when he penned the
cablegram to the Bisbee Review. Major
John C. Greenway, of the engineer corps,
now on the west front defending the de
mocracy of the world against the assault
cf the Hun, was also among those of the
Warren district whom the governor so un
mercifully excoriated because they refused
to allow the I. W. W. to destroy the indus
tries and homes of Bisbee, Lowell and
Warren.
Here are two men for comparison with
the men who in public and private whine
about the corporations cf the state and try
to point to them as responsible tor the acts
of the I. W. W. Wheeler and Greenway
both' left fine positions and great oppor
tunities for the future to fight for the peace
and security of the millions of laboring men
in this country, for their homes and their
children's future happiness and freedom.
That the property interests of this country
might remain secure as a guarantee for
future prosperity of the man who depends
upon his wage. These men are fighting
and risking their lives to save the homes
of the men who are continually whining
about what happened to the I. W. W. at
Bisbee last year.
Harry Wheeler no doubt had read the
message of the governor to the legislature
before writing his cablegram to the Bisbee
Review.
War correspondents are agreed that the
German policy is to hammer, hammer,
hammer, on the way to Paris, stopping only
at necessary intervals to rest, for the next
four months. It is in this period that
America's efforts will count the most.
Every man and gun and pound of food we
can send over there before October will be
worth two later on. It is now or never
with the kaiser, and he knows it better than
any one. Every resource and energy of
the German empire will be hurled against
the allies unceasingly in the wild, desperate
hope that they may prevail before the
American masses turn the scale. America
has surprised both friend and foe by her
efforts since last March. Three mere
months equal to the last three will turn the
trick. For the first time the American
menace has chilled the German heart.
Chateau Thierry was the first dark speck
in the Hunnish horoscope. Soon they will
begin to look through the entire glass dark
ly. And the change for the better in spirit,
thought, word and deed, brought about by
the arrival of hundreds of thousands of
Americans the past ten weeks in France,
is already felt and shown to the world on
the western front. 'Paris and London echo
it. Berlin shudders and shouts her boasts
the louder, but an alarm note can be heard
like a discord in the German blare. Ger
man official statements, to those who read
closely and between the lines, show a
studied and careful course -of preparation
for the German people for a large sized
chunk of trouble from America. And this,
after these same reports had affected to
ignore and despise America ever since we
entered the war.
And now they say we are to have 3,000,
000 men in the American army by August
I . That is only a little more than a month
away. Americans are holding fifty miles
of battle front altogether on the western
lines in France, according to authentic ad
vices now a week old. Thus do great
events crowd" upon the very heels of each
other in America's part in the war. The
first year it was all very discouraging and
slow and prosaic. Blunders, worry, shame
and confusion were our portion then.
Strikes and airplane scandals and machine
gun delays formed about the only news of
America's part in the war. It is true that
we sent a few thousand regulars over there
under Pershing, but they were scattered
about in English and French training camps
and not engaged in battle. But now the
long waiting is about ended. Castigny and
Chateau Thierry are glorious beginnings
of which we may talk in thrilling tones.
Three-quarters of a million men are more
than a mere expeditionary force. And let
us consider; if we can send a half million
men to France in less than three months
with our present shipping facilities, how
many can we send when the number of
these ship3 are doubled, as they will be
within a few months? How long will it
take for a thousand American airplanes a
month to change the haze on the far Ger
man horizon over there? Oh, yes, the news
nowadays is tinged with shining lights and
words that thrill. Our gladiators are leav
ing the long grind cf the training camp
and entering the ring. Listen ! Hie arena
rocks to the sound of the cheering. We are
coming to handstrokes now. Soon we must
mourn our dead. America is in terrible
earnest. German propaganda can hamper
but little now. In fact, pro-Germans lips
are throttled over here. They dare not
murmur out loud. As Bonar Law well
said: "America has arrived."
When you read these reports of mutiny,
rebellion and famine from Austria and Ger
many, always keep the salt cellar firmly in
your good right hand and use it every time
you read a line. They may well be founded
upon much truth, and they may well not
be. For three years we have heard them,
and they have come to naught except the
fiercest, strongest drive upon, Paris that
the war has witnessed so far. Germany
may well be on the verge of an industrial
breakdown and a great famine; by every
token she should be ; but she still has plenty
of shells and guns on her battle front;
plenty of railroads and engines to move her
troops; plenty of troops; plenty of strength
and courage in the breasts of those same
troops. And Austria launched an offensive
that has shaken the Italian line defended by
three million men. Austria and Germany
may be all in. We hope so. The interior
signs" and messages indicate it. But the
exterior signs, as represented by their
armies, indicate something different al
ready yet, as the immortal Mr. Potash
would say.
Germany started the gas attack, and now
she is getting the worst of it. Germany
started the bombing of open cities, and now
she is getting the worst of it. Germany
started the propaganda, and now she is get
ting the worst of it. Of all the propa
gandas ever started since Peter the Hermit
flrieached the first crusade this one that
Christendom has begun against Germany
excels them all. One hundred years hence
it will not even have lost its original mo
mentum. Its blight will lie upon Germany
like a plague and a pestilence throughout
generation after generation.
Here is a new species of profiteering and
piracy. Landlords in Washington, the na
tion's capitol, are holding up war workers,
who come there at the rate of 5,000 a
month, for higher rents than government
salaries will stand. Investigation de
veloped the fact that these landlord sharks
are preying upon the workers at a rate that
drives one-third of the new-comers out of
the city every month. tThey cannot afford
to pay the exhorbitant prices charged for
any kind of shelter. The government will
soon take a hand in this pirate game.
Legislative Gossip
iS:t-t-inl to Tin rtevltw)
PHOEaia, Ariz., June 21. In the
house of the third legislature there
was' firm belief that the senate was
an enemy that lay in wait for houe
bills that it might tear limb from limb.
There was continued bitter comment.
even joined In by the speaker, and
the closing hours nhowed a spirit far
from amicable. That this Bpirit was
based on slight grounds is indicated
by the record. Of the fifty-one bills
considered, the senate killed nine of
its own and only three from the house,
while the house killed fourteen of its
own children and five from the sen
ate. Seven .senate bills went to com
plete action and eight house hills. Con
sideration of one senate bill and three
house bills was cut out by passage of
similar measures. Only cne measure
of the governor's call list went with
out any action beyond introduction. It
was Johns' house hill permitting in
vestment of state funds in government
securities, said to have been held up
at the suggestion of bankers who
found illegal 'features in it. On the
whole, a remarkably large proportion
of the bills had conclusive faction.
Nearly all the forty-two resolutions
and memorials, only a few failed of
passage. These included senate con
current resolution by Campbell, de
bouncing the I. W. W... withdrawn; a
house concurrent resolution by Good
win, making the state librarian custo
dian cf legislative property, left with
out action by the senate; a senate

day and something to the effect that !
pandering to class prejudices is not
the best way to contribute to the win-1
ning of the war. j
The suggestion that a labor-union
ticket may be on the fall baliot is not I
considered by Senator Claypool to be
well founded. He says there will be i
nothing of the sort in his district, I
which includes Globe and Miami. In
some Quarters there is assumption
that the socialists will make an e.spe- j
cial effort this fall if Hunt is not nomi

tlngency, democratic senators calmly !
claim the state as at least 10,000 demo- j

President Claridge of the senate is

About the State
Asst. Co. Atty. C. F. Cable of Tuc
son left yesterday afternon for Ajo to
attend the coroner's inquisition on th3
body of H. C. (Curley ") Duvall, who
died Wednesday nifiht at an Ajo hos
pital of a pistol wound alleced to have
been given by a woman, Ollie lleaton,
proprietor of a soft drink and pool
hall at Clarkston.
Only two of the eleven items of the
governor's call were left without legis
lative action, namely, permission to
invest state funds in national secu
rities and the payment of compensa
tion to Thos. E. Campbell for the time
spent by him in the governor's office.
At least three of ihe bills passed seem
to bo outside the call. The Marsh act.
coni'Ucr.ting vehicles used in bootleg
ging. :!t first had an excuse, as it was
considered a protection to soldiers,
with a limitation of 200 miles from any
military camp. This distance, extena
ed to 400 miles, finally was made tc
include the whole state, without refor
ejee to cmps. Hut the governor sign
ed this bill and also one making pay
n.ent of substantial sums to the wiu
cwv. of Graham county officers killed
in the discharge of their duty. As the
men who killed them were drait
cvaders. among several counts, the af
fair was considered a war activity
and thus possibly one that could be
within the call. Only under the head
of war-time food conservation can
there be consideration of the Greene
bill, now with the governor, demanding
supervision of grain and cotton by
products and directed especially to
the regulation of cottonseed nulls.
Governor Hunt is said to have help
ed in the saving of the dairy products
bill, which had been indefinitely post
poned in the house anil which later
was passed by the narrowest possible
margin. It Is unaersioou mat oacR
ers of the bill now are suggesting ap
pointment as dairy commissioner ot
W. A. Barr, former county agricul
tural apent and an expert in the dairy
line. The job wiil pay $3000 a year.
The road to Ajo from Tombstone Is
marked now in a manner that even a
blind mpn might fol w, for it i
marked by sticks, placed in position
by Monte Mansfield this weok. The
sticks are sunk deep in the ground
and standing five feet high on east
side of the risht cross road. KA'
that is necessary now is to pass be
tween the two sticks at each cross
road and one can not get lost.. No
knowledge of the road is required.
The larse addition to the state capl-1
tol, contemplated in the plans of Archi- j
tect Lescher and Kibbey. which wers !
adopted by the commission of state j
institutions, w ill not be built until a j
session of the legislature appropriates '
the money for the building. This i
statement was made by Leroy A. Ladd, I
chairman of the commission on state !
Institutions. Chairman Ladd stated i
that the appropriation is not su.'ficient I
to cary out the building propram under !
the plans adopted and for that reason j
the addition, which under the present !
plans will be larger than the present
building, will not be started until the
legislature takes the necessary action, i
Suit for daniapes in the sum of $5200 j
was filed against Sheriff Miles of Pima i
county -and the Maryland Casualty !
company, by Samuel Weinstein. in the !
superior court yesterday. Tht sheriff, j
who is known to many people only as
P.ye Miles, Is named in the complaint i
as Jephtha T. Miles. The suit was !
brought as the result of .the sale under
attachment of the property o? the
Tucson Wrecking company to satisfy
judgment by the Consolidated National
bank in the action of the Consolidated
National bank against John Kessler J
and Leo Kessler, who were alleged to
be a co-partnership owning and oper
ing the Tucson Wrecking company, a
junk business.
Governor Hunt has been prompt in
affixing his signature to five more leg
islative acts. They are:
Senate Bill 2. Hall Regulating
handling of dairy products.
Senate Bill 11. Claridge Defining
soldiers' civil rights.
Senate Bill 19. Education commit
tee Establishing alien night schools.
Senate Bill 20. Labor committee
Enforcing the draft laws with regard
to testimony.
Substitute for House Bill 3. Vaughn
Extending suffrage to persons in the
military and naval service, including
organizations officially recognized by
military authorities.
In the hands of the governor, yet
unsigned, are only three bills. They
are: Semite 3, by Claridge, forbidding
sabotage and regulating corporations;
House 2, by Eddy, forbidding idleness
and demanding that manufacturing
plants shall run to top capacity;
House 32, by Greone, concerning by
products of grain and cotton.
To the summing up of the legislative
work are to be added senate resolu
tions, one by Campbell, denouncing
the I. W. W passed, and a similar one
by Roberts, left in the committee on
labor. A third senate resolution offer
ed sympathy to Senator Getchell, con
fined in a Chicago hospital for the
time of the special session. His pay
and that of Senator Hall will be sent
them.
To the house list are to be added
a couple of joint resolutions. One by
.Mrs. Marsh urges congress to demand
the fullest utilization of man power
for the war and the other by John
urges congress to pass measures to
promote education of aliens.
From Oshoni and .Moeur have come,
strong denials of the rumors of their

to be on the edge of starting a daily

HOLDUP MAN GIVEN
FIVE TO TWENTY
YEARS IN PEN
Man Who Robbed Store at
Johnson Pleads Guilty;
Takes Entire Blame but Ac
complice is Also Sentenced
TOMBSTONE. June 21 Thursday
morning the superior court had up for
sentence Fronk Wilson, charged with
the robbery of Albert Peterson, at
Johnson, on June 4, when Wilson
succeeded in making away with over
$3iMK.
Wilson, with three others, rented
a car at Douglas from one Leslie
Fitzgerald, and with two others rone
to Johnson, where he went to the
Peterson Mercantile company, and
yelled to Peterson, who was asleep in
the store that John Bright, the deputy
sheriff of Johnson, had been sho:,
and he, Wilson, wished to phone for
a doctor. Tcterson allowed Wilson
to come in, whereupon Wilson told
him to hand over all the money he
had, which amounted to over $3000.
This was the money which was to Le
used in payment of the miners on the
following day. During the escape,
Wilson lost his hat, which was ore
of the clues which led to his IuKr
capture in El Paso.
Wilson made a statement to Coun
ty Attorney Ross, that he hi:useif
was the only person who knew r.nv
thing about the robbery until after
he had completed the job, and that
Fitzgerald and Mrs. Minnie Reason
over, and one Shirk, who accompanied
him were innocent of the crime. Wil
son also implicated another party
whom lie claimed knew all about the
robbery, and after it was completed
took $250 of the spoils from him. Tho
county attorney's office will give tnis
matter thorough investigation in or
der 13 ascertain tne truth of the state
ment. Wilson made the statement in open
court, and after his plea of guilty, the
court sentenced him to serve a se'i.
tence of from five to twenty years in
the penitentiary.
Fitzgerald was Inf3nned against by
County Attorney Ross as an acces
sory after the fact to the robbery, and
plead guilty for which he received a
sentence of two years in the peniten
tiary. No disposition has been made of
the other defendant, Mrs. Minnie Re.i
sonover, until further Investigation h i.s
been made.
In the case of the state vs. D. K.
Jennings, charged with obtaining
money under false pretenses, the de
fendant who l.s only 20 years old en
tered a plea of not guilty and asked
permission to join the navy, which
was granted and this afternoon was
accepted by the navy recruiting of
ficer who came over from Bisbee.

WILL MEET TODAY.
The Cochise county highway com
mission meets at its close in Bisbee
on Saturday for the purpose of re
ceixing bids for the grading and
drainage work of the Bisbee to Doug
las county highway. It is thought
that there will be several bids, ac
cording to present indications, and
this important wor will be started
at the earliest possible moment. It
is necessary that the road bed or
grade stand for some time after it is
constructed before any attempt can
be made to pave it, which may mean
that the paving will not be done for
a number of months since it is best
to have it go through a rainy season
and it is probable that it cannot be
completed in time to get the benefit
of this summers rains. It that
event it will be necessary to wait for
fall or winter rains before the pave
ment can be laid, which will allow
the road bed to settle enough to make
the paving a first class job in order
that it will not suffer settlement and
cracking. The board will also open
the bids for furnishing the iron cul
verts to be used, etc.

WASHINGTON'. June 21. Formal
denial of reports circulated hi this
country, presumably by Herman
agents, that negro scbiiers with th'
Ameiican expeditionary lories are lnv
ing given ciore dangerous work than
tlie white troops was cabled to the war
department tpday by General I'er
shing. The message said the negroes
were in high spirits and that their only
complaint was that they were not giv
en more active service.
General Pershing said he could not
commend too highly the spirit shown
among ths colored combat troops, who
exhibit fine capacity for quick training
and eagerness for the most dangerous
work.
Ths general's cablegram, which wa-!
in reply to one or inquiry seni .y
Secretary Ilaker, said in part:
'The stories, probably invented by
German agents, that colored soldiers
in France are always placed in most
dangerous positions and sacrificing
them to save white soldiers; that when
wounded they are left on grouni' to
die without medical attention, etc., are
absolutely false."
The message went on to expiain
that in the four colored combatant
regiments now in France there havc
been only twenty-five deaths and two
men wounded severely.
The exploits of two colored infan
trymen some week3 ago in repelling
a much larger German patrol, killing
and wounding several Germans ami
winning the Croix De Guerre by their
gallantry, has aroused a fine spirit
of emulation throughout the colored
troops, all of whom are looking tor-
ward to more active service.
They are especially amused at tae
most dangerous positions. I cannot
commend too highly the spirit shown."

Anna Anderson, a nifty little finish

the school is too. too. The teachers are
too staid, the principal is too anciently

Well Ann starts things as soon as
she gets there. She makes that old
boarding school sit up and wonder.
She is a jqy in the hearts of the pu

watchman sees a man entering Ann's
bedroom window. That is the last

the man who i3 found hiding in her

drizzling rain, but refused the offer

Enthusiastic applause barked the

street. It had been intended to hold
the night concert at the same place,
