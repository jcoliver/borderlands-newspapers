Far West To Be The Special
Objective Of Speaking Tour
Of Nation Beginning July 4
Republican Foes. On Special
Train To Follow President
Up With Orators To Refute
WASHINGTON, June 16. Presi
dent Wilson, facing a divided senate,
has decided to carry his fight for rat
ification of the League of Nations
covenant directly to the people in a
country-wide speaking tour. He ex
pects to begin the trip as soon as he
returns from Paris. . . j
The President's decision was re
vealed here today coincident with re
ceipt of a message in which he de
clined to give the senate, in advance
of signing, the official text of the
peace treaty, requested in a resolu
tion adopted over vigorous opposition
of the league supporters.
Debate' Begins Today
Neither developments caused great
surprise here, hut each served to em
phasize the President's position and
to provide further subject matter for
the debate 'which begins tomorrow on
Senator Knox's resolution to put the
senate on record against accepting
the league covenant along with the
peace treaty. .
A tentative itinerary for the speak
ing trip has been completed by Sec
retary Tumulty, but it will not be
made public until Mr. Wilson finally
has approved it.
It Is expected, however, that the
tour will carry him Into the far West
andt will occupy many days. . It was
said he probably would devote -most
attention to wVstern states where
league opposition has gained the
greatest headway.
As nearly as officials here can pre
dict Mr. Wilson will reach Washing
ton about July 1, will lay the treaty
formally before the senate and then
possibly on Independence Day, will
begin a swing around the circle that
will eclipse in extent and . in spirit
all his previous direct appeals to the
people.
Opposition to Follow Him Up
It is regarded as certain that op
position speakers will follow the
President's special train through the
doubtful states.
Opposition senators generally, howj
ever, declined today from making any
comment on the executive's plan of
campaign. The message declining to
send the treaty text also was receiv
ed when it was read to the senate,

WHICH LEAVES TERMS AS ORIGINALLY
Remarkable Denunciation By French "Tiger" Is All Germany

For Evilness "Unexampled In History"
PARIS, June 16. The final reply of
the allied and associated powers to
the conditions of peace handed to
the Germans at Versailles May 7 was
delivered to the German delegation
and made public shortly afterward.
The Germans are allowed seven
days to accept or to refuse the treaty
as it stands. If they accept, peace
will be signed at once; if they do not
accept, the armistice will terminate
Moaday, June 23, and the powers will
take such steps as may be necessary
to enforce their terms.
The principles of the original treaty
have been vigorously upheld, as estab
lishing a peace of justice; but certain
modifications in detail and many ex
planations of the effect of execution
are made.' The reply is in two parts
a general covering fetter and Beriatim
discussion of the German counter pro
posals. The changes Include:
Principal Changes
"A plebiscite for upper ' Silesia,

territory. " '
Frontier rectifications in West
Prussia.
. Omission of the third zone in
the Schleswig plebiscite.
Temporary Increase of the Ger

Offer to co-operate with a Ger

Certain detailed modifications in
the finance, economic . and
ports and waterways clauses,
including abolition of the proposed
Kiel canal commission. ,
Assurance of membership In the
League of Nations in the early
- future If Germany fulfills her ob
ligations. Clemenceau Replies to Protests
The covering letter is from M.
Clemenceau, president of the peace
conference, to Count von Brockdorff
Rantzau, president of the German
delegation. In this letter M. Clemen
ceau says:
' "The allied ' and associated power
have given the most earnest considera
tion to the observations of the German
delegates on the draft treaty of peace.
The reply protests against the peace
on the ground that it conflicts with
the terms upon which the, armistice
of November 11, 1918, was signed that
it is a peace of violence, and not a
peace of justice. The protest of the
German delegation shows that they
fail to understand the position in
which Germany stands today. Thev
seem to think that Germany has only
to 'make sacrifices in order to attain

peace,' as if this were but the end
of some mere struggle for territory
and power. The allied and associated
powers, therefore, feel it necessary to
begin their reply by a clear statement
of the judgment of the world, which
has been forged by practically the
whole of civilized mankind.
"Tiger" Hits From Shoulder
"In the view of the allied and asso
ciated powers, the war which began
August 1, 1914, was the greatest crime
against humanity and freedom of the
people that any nation calling itself
civilized has ever consciously commit
ted. For many years the rulers of
Germany, true to the Prussia l tradi
tions, strove for a position of domi
nance in Europe. They were not satis
fied with that sxowine prosperity and
influence to which Germany was en
titled, and which all other nations
were willing to accord ter; they re
quired that they should be able to
dictate and tyrannize over a subserv
ient Europe, as they dictated and ty
rannized over a subservient Germany.
"In order to attain their ends they
used every channel through which to
educate their own subjects In the
doctrines that might was richt in in
ternational affairs. They never ceased
to exoand German armaments by land
and sea and to propagate the false
hood that It was necessary because
Germany's neiehbors were jealous of
her prosperity and power.
Excoriates Espionage System
"She soueht to sow hostility and
suspicion, instead of frlendshin be
tween nations. The Germans devel
oped a svstem of esnionaere and in
trigue through which the were en
abled to stir up internal rebellion and
even to mVe secret offensive prepara
tions within the territory of their
neighbors, whereby thev mieht. when
the moment came, strike them down
with ereater certainty and ease.- They
keot Europe m a ferment by threats
of violence, and when they found that
their neighbors were resolved to re
Glst their arroecant will, they deter
mined to assert their predominance in
Europe by force.
Puts Blame Where It Belongs
"As soon as their preparations were
complete, they eneouraeed a subserv
ient ally to declare war . on Serbia
on 48 hours' notice, a war Involving
the control of the Balkans, which thev
knew could not be localized and which
was bound to unchain a general war.
"In order to make doubly sure, they
refused any attemnt at conciliation
and conference, until It was too late
and the world war was Inevitable.' for
which they had plotted and for which,
alone among the nations, thev were
adeouately equinped and prepared.
"Germany's resoonslbilitv. however,
is not confined to hvina: planned and
started the war. She is no less re
BDonsible for the savaee and inhuman
manner in which it was conducted.
Though Germany was herself the guar
anty of Belgium. Germany violated the
rules after a solemn Bromine to re
spect the neutrality of this unoffend
inc people.
Huns Conducted War of Terrorism
"Not content with this, they deliber
ately carried out a series of promiscu

sole oblect of terrifying the inhabit
ants into submission by the very
frightfulnesB of their action. They
were the first to use poisonous gas,
notwithstanding the appalling suffer
ing it entailed. They began the bomb
ing and long distance shelling ot
towns, for no military object, but sole
ly for the purpose of reducing the
morale of their opponents by striking
at their women and children. 1

Reminds Germany She Is
Held In Contempt By World
PARIS, June 16. (By the ''As
sociated Press) The Germans
have btlen granted an additional
forty-eight hours in which to
make their reply regarding the
signing of the peace treaty.
VERSAILLES, June 16. (By , the
Associated Press) The reply of the
allied and associated governments to
Germany's counter proposals and a
revised cop"y of the peace treaty to
night are in the hands of Count von
Brockdorff-Rautfkii, who is on his
way to Weimar, there to present to
the German national assembly the
final word of the victors in the war.
Few changes have been made in
the revised treaty. Five days was
the allotted period originally fixed
for the Germans to answer yes or no
to the demands of the allies. But two
days additional have been granted be
cause of the insistence of the German
delegation that not sufficient time
has been allowed for proper consider
ation of the revised terms. This will
extend the time limitation to Mon
day, June 23. If Germany's reply is
yes the treaty will be immediately
signed; if Germany declines to ac
cede to the demands the armistice
will be automatically terminated and
the allied armed forces will take
whatever steps they deem requisite
to the occasion.
The revised treaty contained inter
lineations in red ink, where changes
had been made in It. It had been
impossible to reprint the treaty in
time for its presentation today.
Clemenceau Severely Scores Huns
The covering note by Premier
Clemenceau severely castigates. Sei

Both Branches Of Congress
"Het Up" Over Invasion
By U. S. Troops
WASHINGTON, June 16. Discus
sion of Mexican affairs was evoked
today in both houses of congress by
the crossing of the .Rio Grande by
American troops. ,
The subject was brought up in the
senate by Senator WatBon, Republi
can of Indiana, who asked whether the
sending of troops into Mexico amount
ed to an invasion and whether it was
ordered by the president or by the war
department. Senator Fall, Republican
of New Mexico, spoke at length on
border affairs.
In the house Representative Gould,
Republican of New York, charged the
crossing of the border "constituted a
tacit offensive military alliance be
tween the United States and Mexico of
which congress had not been ap
prised." "If our troops were sent in to pro
tect American citizens, and property
I thank God and welcome it,' said
Senator Fall. If that was the purpose
of invading Mexico, I congratulate the
war department. If the purpose was
to protect the Camnza garrison In
Juarez, then there is no defense for
the war department.'
Senator Fall read a telegram from
r. w. Dudley, state senator of El
Paso, Texas, stating the American
movement was in aid ot Carranza and
placed in jeopardy every American in
Mexico.
The New Mexico senator declared
President Carranza was unable to pro
tect Americans In Mexico and chareed
that news regarding Mexican affairs
had been sunoressed hv the American
press at the request ot Secretary Lans

els in and near Juarez last night and
today," were billeted in barracks and
camps on the American side tonight
and were asleep before dark after
their 24 hours of preparation and ex
ecution. As the rear guard to the cavalry,
artillery and engineers columns which
wound over the mesa from the river
late today, seven ragged, high hatted
Mexican prisoners were herded to
ward the Fort Bliss stockade by a
detachment of the Fifth cavalry while
another cavalry regiment drove a
herd, of 100 Mexican horses and po
nies captured rrom the Villa forces
to the remount station.
While no official report of the cav

bank of the river, and one cavalry
horse killed and another wounded in
the knee.
After crossing during the night the
cavalry column, supported by a bat
talion of the 82nd artillery, advanced
and, at daybreak started scouting
over the low, marshy fields in the el
bow of the Rio Grande, south of
Ysleta, Texas. Capturing the seven
prisoners before reaching the Villa
camp, the cavalry was enabled to pro

nel shells directly over the heads o
the fleeing Villa force and many were
killed in this manner.' After the two
cavalry forces had pursued the rebels
over more than SO square miles, they
formed a junction and returned to
the American side of the river, ac
companied by the artillery and Sth
engineers, who threw a pontoon
bridge across the river.
Troopers Return Tired and Soiled
The cavalry, artillery and engi
neers presented a tired, soiled and
travel-stained appearance when trey
marched over the mesa to Fort Bliss
tonight. The heavy cavalry horses
had found difficulty in keeping up the
speed set by the wiry little Mexican
cow ponies and they showed their
fatigue in drooped heads and tails.
The men sat, saddle-weary on their
mounts. Many had souvenirs of the
Villa pursuit. One cavalryman from
the mountains of Tennessee obtained
a sombrero with the golden star worn
by Villa's "dorados" or golden guards.
Another obtained an old Mauser rifle
from a dead soldier. Private Wod
dell of the 9th engineers, foraged a
miniature mule and rode it all the
way to the post. Officers obtained
silver spurs and many sombreros,
knives and crude equipment were
brought back.

professed to be either farmers in the
valley or Carranza soldiers, none ad
mitting having been with Villa. They
had but six horses and mules, one
prisoner having to ride double on a
mule that had been shot in the left
forefoot and will have to be destroyed.

M. Clemenceaus says Germany fails

pies today iicthe estimation ,of the
world for being responsible for a war
which was "the greatest crime against

ple that any nation, calling itself ctr

general 'secretary of the peace con
ference, at 6:49 o'clock this evening
placed the revised draft of the treaty

M. Dutasta arrivec In Versailles at
6:20 o'clock carrying the momentous
documents in two parcels wrapped in
prosaic brown paper and was con

Hotel Reservoirs.
Here the party was grouped along
one side of the room. In front of M.
Dutasta was a large marble topped
table, upon which the documents were
placed in two piles. The Germans
took their place at the other side of
the table.
At 6:49 o'clock Herr Simon infor
mally reached across the table and
took the documents and handed them
to Baron von Loersner, this actually
constituting the formal receipt of the
treaty and the ultimatum. A receipt

What Do You Think About It?
By W. R. W.
W. E. Oxsheer, station agent: "I be
lieve that now with the German situa
tion cleared up the Mexican revolu
tionary forces will have to walk the
chalk line. I wouldn't be surprised
but that it would develop later that
the Mexican federal forces had some
thing to do with the shooting up of
El Paso for the purpose of forcing the
United States troops to take- some ac
tion. .
Frank Thomas, court interpreter:
"There will always be trouble in Mex
ico and along the border until Villa
has been put out of commission. He
is capable of all kinds of trouble to
ub as long as he can get ammunition
and supplies."
James Allison, justice of. the peace:
"I have never forgotten and will nev
er forget the affair at Columbus, N. M.,
which Villa staged and something
ought to be done to eliminate him
from tr.e possibility of a future opera
tion of that kind.
P. H. Halleck, city engineer: "From
the many reports in the past of the
many deaths of Villa I hope that the
ner time he is killed he is cremated
to prevent his usual return to life
again." '
Barney Norton, acting police judge:
"If Villa is caught I hope he is brought
to Bisbee for trial. We will give him
a fair trial?"
J. J. Bowen, Bisbee Auto company:
"It begins now to look like the gov
ernment was going to do something
about the Mexican situation and if the
same policy is pursued business along
the border will take a turn for the
good."
F. S. Cundiff, manager Telephone
company: "It's about time the United
States did something about the rebel
situation along the border and I am
glad to see 6uch quick and decisive
action on the part ofxthe wr.r depart
ment in the emergency at El Paso."
Capt. M. E.. Cassidy, with Phelps
Dodge company: "I am greatly in
terested in the coming state conven
tion of the American Legion at Tucson
next month and would like to see ev
ery returned soldier and sailor in the
Bisbee district attend this meeting. I
understand that reduced railroad rates
will be given for thitf gathering."
A. B. Nelson, formerly Sergeant l6t
Arizona Infantry: "I would like to be
in El Paso today and see the fun.
Reminds U3 of the old border days '
when we were stationed at Naco but
these little skirmishes with the Mex
icans are child's play compared with
the fighting n France."
C. H. Hogan, insurance man: "The
complexion of the Mexican situation
now is far different from what it was
before the war with Germany. Our
government is in a different position
from a diplomatic standpoint from
what it was in those days. The Ger
man and English influences in Mexico
do not have to be 'reckoned with now

Tom Egan, Commercial club: "I am
glad to see the situation around El

greatly Improve the relations between
the business interests in that part of
the country and will greatly benefit
business in general all along the

Jos Wright, of Lowell; "The future

from succor, at the mercy of the winds
and the waves and the yet more ruth
less submarine crews. They drove
thousands of women and children with
brutal savagery into slavery in foreign
lands; they allowed barbarities to be
practiced against their prisoners of
war. from which the most uncivilized
people would have recoiled.
Barbarous Conduct Unexampled
"The conduct of Germany is almost
unexampled in human history. The
terrible responsibility which lies at
her doors can be seen by the fact that
not less than seven million dead lie
buried in Europe, while more than
twenty million others carry upon them
the evidence of wounds and suffering
because Germany saw fit to gratify
her lust for tyranny by resort to war.
"The allied and associated powers
believe that they will be false to those
who have given their all to save the
freedom of the world if they consent
to treat war on any other basis than
as a crime against humanity and right.
Quotes Wilson's "Force to Limit"
"This attitude of the allied and as
sociated powers was made perfectly
clear to Germany during the war by
the principal statesmen. It was de
fined by President Wilson in his
speech of April 6, 1918, and explicitly
and categorically accepted by the Ger
man people as a principle covering the
peace 'let everything that we say, my
fellow countrymen, everything that we
henceforth plan and accomplish, ring
true to this response, till the majesty
and might of our concerted power
shall fill the thought and utterly de
feat tbe force of those who flout and
disprize what we honor and hold dear.
Germany has once more said that
force. - and force alone, shall decide
whether justice and peace shall reign
in the affairs of men, whether right
as America conceives it, or dominion,
as she conceives it, shall determine
the destinies of mankind. There is,
therefore, but one response possible
from us: force, force ,to the utter
most, force without stint pr limit, the
righteous and triumphant force which
shall make the law of the world and
cast every selfish dominion down in
the dust.' "
M.; Clemencenu, in the letter also
quotes from speeches delivered by
Premier Lloyd George, himself as pre
mier of France, and Premier Orlando
of Italy, in which it was specifically
declared that when victory was won,
compromise as to peace terms was im
possible and just punishment should
be meted out, and continues:
Must Be Justice for War Victims
"Justice, therefore, is the only pos
sible basis for the settlement of the
accounts of this terrible war. Justice
is what the German delegation asks
for And says that Germany has been
promised. But it must be justice for
all. There must be justice for the
dead and wounded and for those who
have been made orphans and bereaved
that Europe might be free from Prus
sian depotism. There must be justice
for the people who now stagger under
war debts, which exceed thirty billion,
that liberty might be saved. There
must be justice for those millions
whose homes and lands, ships and
property German savagery has spoliat
ed and destroyed.
"That is why the allied and associ
ateed powers have insisted as a card
inal feature of ,the treaty that Ger
many must undertake to make repara
tions to the very uttermost of her
power, for reparation for wrongs in
flicted is of the essence of justice."
MANAGER OF PENNEY
STORE GOES TO MESA
Mr. II. A. Price manager of the

When a man begins to feel SATISFIED
look out! He has shut the door to new

EVERY LITTLE WHILE it is good to get
down to first principles to take stock of

yourself the THIRD DEGREE.
You can't depend upon your pres

"For building up a retail

Going Up
Three great ' contributions to architecture made by America fire
proof buildings, steel-frame construction and the elevator. Most impor
tant is the elevator. Without it, the other two would not be possible.
Thirty-two thousand apartments erected every normal year in New
York City alone. ' Consider that and you realize the importance of the
elevator. This is its 60th anniversary.
Spend your vacation in the canyons of the southwest and see the
ruins of primitive apartment houses that lodged Mr. Cliffdweller and
family, the people with active muscles and lazy brains. Daily they
climb dizzy heights via ladders too stupid and lazy to invent an elevator.
Archimedes, discoverer of the fulcrum, or crowbar, grasped the idea
of the pulley, conceived a movable room (elevator) and raised the con
traption by winding the end of the rope on a revolving drum moved by
levers. The worlds' first elevator.
. Villoyer, centuries ago, copied the idea of Archimedes. Called his
device the "flying chair." French king's daughter tried it out. It
stuck between Cowers and servants had to break down the walls of the
shaft.
It was 1850 before men began to take the elevator idea seriously..
Then Hecker Bros., flour merchants of New York, installed a platform
: tha moved up and down between notched columns like the jack you
lift your Ford with. Steam did the lifting.
Most progress is the result of accident. An elevaior loaded with
boxes of. sugar dropped but the boxes did not break. The car had com
pressed the air as it descended, the cellar, being almost airtight That
instant was born the air-cushion principle used today.
Ia 1853 Otis Tuft came out with a vertical screw steel ararngement
with a closed gear, and the modern elevator was a fact.
Ponder the development of the elevator, and you have the key to all
progress.
First come the men ' whcse brains discover mecbanrcal principles.
Then other minds invent steel, strong cables, steam, engines the means
of putting the ideas into effect.
The real benefactor to mankind is the man who can group principles
and apply them to materials.
All the principles of the elevator, all the materials for making them,
were known years before a genius applied them.
rThe elevator made skyscrapers possible, but it occurred to no one
to develop the steel-frame on skeleton type of building until 1891. Dur
ing the Worlds Fair the Masonic Temple of Chicago was a great marveL
Today it is a dwarf compared with the Woolworth building, where the
elevator carries you up 54 floors without stopping.
All the knowledge of the world is valueless unless you can apply it.
Countless combinations of principles and materials now in common
use are possible; fame and wealth await the organizing brain that can
co-ordinate them into something useful for the human race that can
furnish an elevator to save the labo rious climbing of stairs.
Men Live Up to Our Hopes For Them
' .
I BY THE REV. CHARLES STELZLE
"Thou are a rock." said Jesus to Peter but Peter had apparently
been anything but a rock in the estimation of his associates, because
he was so impetuous, and so easily moved by emotion.
But Jesus saw something in Peter that nobody else saw. Peter
knew that he had qualities of strength if only he were given the chance
to use them but he also knew that he had weaknesses which might
nullify his strength. '
And Jesus knew this, weaknesses, too, but the method of Jesus in -dealing
with men was to remind them of their good points if they had
any so as to encourage them in we 11-doing.
He followed this principle when he selected his disciples. Some of
them did not come up to hi3 expectations, but undoubtedly they were
greatly strengthened because they knew that their Leader counted on
them.
And that's the way to get the most out of people. If they imagine
that we do not hope for much from them, they'll get their cue from that
attitude. .
If they feel that they're being counted on to make good, they'll
strain every nerve to livep to their reputations.
The Future
The World Is Mine
A young man said, "If there was only one way I could see myself
in the future, how much easier it would be now."
We can see ourselves In the future if we are willing to make an
honest inventory of our intentions. Here are a few formulas lo go by:
If I am thrifty, honest and interested in my neighbors I am pretty
eure of a home, a flood income and many friends in after years.
If I am selfish, grabbing and looking for my own interests, only,
the future will contain money in pUnty, perhaps, a house and a few
acquaintances who avoid me except when my position or my money
will benefit them.
If I want to do big things. and am willing to make the sacrifices to
attain my desires, I'll get thim.
And, so on through a great Ions list of ifs that will show you what
you will be in years to come.
But, you must be honest with yo ufrsel in looking ahead. You've
got to go beneath your daily attitude toward life and find out if the
attitude is grounded on solid rock. Otherwise the formula will not
work.
Congressmen are preparing measures to punish bomb plotters.
Wouldn't it be a good Idea to prepare borne measure to lock the door
before the horse is stolen?
Burleson says that he has received threateuing IctterB, also, but
was not frightened. He probably figured it out that critics of bum service
wouldn't use bombs. .
Penny: A coin of infinitesimal value, minted by the government in
order that citizens may pay It back to the government as tax on all
articles that a congressman considers luxuries.
Frank A. Vanderlip has quit banking to "do useful work." The ac
tion is commendable enough, but why knock tbo bankers who stay on the
Job?
Perhaps it would be unkind to intimate that Burleson hastened to
give back the wire lines in order to let somebody else handle the strike
of operators.

Two Real Chances to Invest With Real Oil Men
A Great Chance for the Small Investor as the Capital Stock of This Com
pany Is Only $45,000.00 and This Stock Is Now Being Offered at Ten Cents
Per Share.
$45,000 capital, Two Tracts, Total 25 Proven Acres, 10c a Share.
We are Drilling Today at 76(5 Feet Just Across the Road From the Fam
ous Sunshine Hill Property Which Is Reported Has Already Paid Back To
Their Investors $60.00 for Each Dollar Invested.
This well is being drilled on our well known twenty-acre tract which is
located on the slope of the famous Sunshine Hill, the most prominent prop
erty in the entire Electra field. Funds are already In our bands to complete
this well. All we need now is a small amount to complete the drilling fund
to develop our wonderful five-acre lease which is located right in the heart
of the big GUSHERS at BURKBURNETT. Our drilling site is within a mile
of the world's wonder well, the great Burk-Waggoner, which has already cre
ated probably the greatest sensation that the Twentieth Century has yet ex
perienced. A glance at the map shows quite plainly that we are completely
surrounded by either big producing wella or wells now drilling through ad
vices from some of the most prominent geologists in the entire Mid-Continent
field. And it yould be well for us to state that it haa been reported to us
this morning that a five-acre tract approximately 1,200 feet from this lease
was sold for $6,500 per aero and the developers of this lease will receive only
one-half of the oil. This means that the five-acre tract was sold for $32,500.
Isn't our acreage worth the same amount? Bear in mind that this five, acres
is only one-fifth of our entire acreage and with our capitalization of $15,000,
and with our 25 proven acres. We ask you this question, can we lose? Is
it possible? As experienced oil men we say that every indication -bears us
cut in our statement when we asserted that our acreage was practically
proven property.
Thi Company Is Not a Prospect Our Derrick Tor Well Number Two
Is Completed the Boilers, 'Machinery and Fuel Is Already on the Ground
the Contractor Already Has Funds and Is Today Buying Casing.
We are not drilling a wildcat. A second glance at the map snows that
we are surrounded by the following gushers: The M. & P. Burk, just re
cently in is reported to be m'aking 3.500 barrels flush production. This well
is about 1,500 steps directly north of our property. To the east of us is the
Gclden Cycle, Burk-Waggoner, Thrift. Texas Chief, King 8, Golconda, Hum
ble wells, and dozens of others. All of these wells came in with production
estimated at better than two thousand barrels. The Texas Chief, to the
north, is reported making better than five thousand barrels. A well like
this pays for itself in from two to four days. United, just north of us, breaks
the record. L'urk-Waggoner came in running fifty barrels every fifteen min
utes, and just recently paid back to its stockholders $33.00 for every one
dollar invested. The Humble Company sells a half interest for twenty mil
lion dollars. Marine pays everybody back seventeen and a half to one, while
the Floydada announces a 400 per cent dividend to be paid in twenty-one
days. In view of these facts, and we could recite dozens of others, we ask
you point blank; is it fair to yourself to pass up such an investment as wo
are offering you today. The King 8 Oil Company, who have a small capital
like ourselves, have just brought in a wonderful gusher to the east of our
five-acre tract and we are in formed that they are tonight being offered
$800,000 for their holdings. Can you beat this for quick returns? Were
you ever offered such an opportunity before in your life-time? Don't forget
for one minute about the Fowler Oil stock which paid back one hundred fifty
dollars for each dollar invested to its stockholders. From the proceeds from
their oil and acreage at Burkburnett, Texas. When you invest with U3 you
are placing your funds in the hads of oil operators who will use your money
In developing only proven acreage, only proven territory, iwhere the risk haa
been practically removed. We absolutely do not do wildcat drilling.

REPORT r-
Remember, $45,000 capital is very small. We could have made it .inv
times larger, but we realized that by giving our stockholders a square deal,
giving them quick action on their money, that we will be able, after oil is'
encountered, to continue acting as their financial advisors. Oil is worth
two dollars and forty cents per barrel. It has been estimated by men who
claim to know that profits of one dollar a barrel are made through retining.
We do not believe that we would be taking care of our investors' money if we
were to allow this additional profit to go to someone else, and for that reason
we are contemplating the erection of a two still refinery (five hundred bar
rels each) so that we may be able to refine and market our own production
when oil is encountered. In view of immense production on our leases we
have already been in conference with the Aiken interest of Dallas, who have
intimated that $18,000 would be sufficient to construct a skimming plant
of this nature. This refinery is one using the late 20th Century process
None of the funds from the sale of these securities will be used In building
this plant. We will build same only when production, warrants it and from
a small portion of the profits derived from the sale of our own oil. if one
dollar a barrel is a fair profit from refining, theiv we ask you this question
How many days would it take to build this plant on just the amount of money
we will save by refining our own oil? Aside from the oil production this re
finery should net us a splendid revenue every thirty days.

PHOENIX, June 16. An engineer

By constructing such sub-reservoir,
all dangers of a water shortage would
be dispensed with, it is believed. This

PHOENIX HIGH
SCHOOL SWAMPED
PHOENIX, June 16. What Phoenix
Union High school is going to do with
its more than 1000 students during
the next school term is a question
which is perplexing members of the
board of education.
Enrollment for the next school
term will far exceed that of any pre
vious year, it is expected. More than
250 students were graduated from
Phoenix grammar schools during the
past year and another 150 will be
available from the district adjacent
to this city. Total enrollment for the
1919-20 term will be at least 150 larg
er than for the year just closed, it is
believed. "
When the present group of build
ings was constructed, it was with the
idea of accommodating between 650
and 700 students. Phoenix has long
since outgrown its present high school

BY O. B. JOYFUL
The Stars and Stripes really had
three birthdays. The fourteenth of
June Is merely one of them. It is,
however, the first of the three, and
therefore, the most important.
Congress took three guesses at ar
ranging the flag.
First, June 14, 1777, dear old con
gress said, "Let there be a star and
rtripe for each of the states." And
so .it was 13 stars and 13 stripes.
Dear old congress didn't even dream
of there coming a day when there'd
be more states Now isn't that just
like congress?
Congress cannot see farther than
its own nose, and when it forgets its
spectacles , the range of congressional
vision is stjll less.
So on May.l, 1794, the American
flag had another birthday. Congress
counted the states and found 15, Ver
mont and Kentucky having been ad-1
mitted. Congress said, "Oh, very '
well, we'll stick a couple more stars
and a couple more stripes and let it,
go at that." , 1
The star spangled banner waved 15 ;
montn roilowmg June was
picked for the signing of the
declaration' of independence.
A month after the wedding
the first tilt comes off and.
both parties srongly voice
their opinions of independ
ence. At a wedding, more
fuss is raised over the bride 1
than the groom. She is.
smothered with all he atten
tion, which is just another
way of expressing sympathy.
The groom is the lion, but in
He is just looked on as the
affair he is made to feel like

stars and as many stripes in the
breeze until April 4, 1818, when it got
another birthday.
Sleepy-eyed congress woke up and
again counted the states by heck!
there were 20 of 'em!
' And congress fussed around trying
to get that many stripes on a flag
and still have it sizable for waving
purposes.
"Can't be done," congress bewailed,
"not enough r6om for 20 stripes."
After getting considerable expert
opinion, listening to a thousand
speeches, and reading the latest al
manac congress put through a law
shoving back the number of stripes to!
the original 13 and passing a star!
around to every state.
Vermont and Kentucky are the only
states in the union that once had
stripes on the flag and haven't got
'em there now.
Hawaii and Alaska want stars.
' Perto Rico ..wants a star or a flag
of her own.
! Aside from those ambitious souls
the flag as she is suits every Ameri
can excepting of course, the Reds
and they're not Americans.
. With Hawaii and Alaska there'd be
50 stars.
Flammarion' informs us that there are
100,560,190 stars in the heavens. .
Once in 1785 the state of Frank
lin came near getting both a star and
Btripe in the flag. 1 Ask your little boy
to "bound the state of Franklin, and
name the capital." That'll hold him
for quite a while.
"Well and so you'll know when he
admits he doesn't the state of Frank
lin was organized by what were then
western North Carolinans. They tried
to break away from the parent state,

COOLIES IN FRANCE
WILL TAKE TO CHINA
NEW VIEW OF WEST
BY HAROLD E. BECHTOL
European Manager of the Newspaper
Enterprise Association
PARIS, June 16. The greatest
school for Chinese in the world is not
in China, but here in France.
It has 140,000 pupils Chinese cool
ies working at the base ports and on
the battlefields of France and Bel
gium. "These coolies," says Dr. W. W.
Peter, former Toledo, Ohio, physician
of long residence in China, "are go
ing hack east as interpreters of
western civilization.
"They will tell the story of the
west, as they, have seen it, to hun
dreds of thousands of other Chinese
people, in the teashops, at work, in
the streets, in their homes."
"What will they say?" I asked.
Dr Peter knows if anybody knows.
He spent years among the people' in
the cities and in the interior of China,
doing medical and hospital work, de
livering' lecturers, showing lantern
slides and exhibits designed to teach
simple health laws.
He came from China to work among
the Chinese over here, at the request
of the Y. M. C. A. after America en
tered the war.
"The coolies," he said, "will un
doubtedly carry back to China a great
discontent with the old order of liv
ing, with century old methods.
"When they enlisted they were get
ting probably $8 a month and chow;
they had nothing but the clothes on
their hack; they lived in insanitary
shacks or houses and their living con
ditions were generally low. 4
"They began watching and studying
from the minute they were lined up
for examination. They began to won
der 'Why am I among the choosen?
Why is not he? What ,do they listen
at my chest for? There must be a
reason for this.'
"They got new clothes and they
would get off in a corner and' ex
amine carefully every garment from
.head to toe. They crossed a vast
pond, than another vast pond in a
boat hundreds of times larger than
anything they had ever seen, for most
of them came from the interior north.
"In camp they were hardened up;
they were given rough but comfort
able and clean quarters; they saw
machinery that performed marvelous
lasKs; iney learnea uiscipuiie; . nicy
saw organization and co-ordination
and what is accomplished; methods
that got things done in a terrible hur

themselves. They do more work than
they ever did. They don't feel tired.
They feel like working. They find
it nice to have everything clean and

"They have built railroads "enor

"They have taken note of the big

"SANKEY TYPE" MUSIC
LONDON. June 16. America's pop
ular revival hymns, called the "San
key type." do not meet the approval
of the Congressional Union ot Eng
land and Wales. "The time is coming,"
said the chairman of the assembly in
a speech which was vigorously ap
plauded, "when a congregation will be
ashamed to offer to God such pitiable
doggerel as 'Fight the Good Fight
With All Thy Might; or to offer the
evening hymn of thanksgiving tc
such a waltz tune as Jetssie, the
Flower of Dunblane!' "

STOCKS AND BONDS
NEW YORK, June 16. The stock
market continued its reactionary
course, chiefly as a result of adverse
monetary conditions and other unfav
orable developments which precipitat
ed further liquidation of speculative
holdings.
Call money rose to 12 per cent for
mixed collateral and as much as 15 per
cent was paid for loans on all indus
trial securities.
Time funds were firm. The rate for
commercial paper also hardened and
heavy discontinuing was reported by
the local federal reserve bank.
. These significant incidents were re
inforced by cables which suggested a
demonstration by the allied forces, the
more critical situation in Mexico and
disapproval by share holders of the
plan to dispose of the Mercantile Ma
rine tonnage and assets to British in
terests. Trading was large and varied, but
most of the acttivity occurred during
the intermediate and later stages of
the session.
Among popular oils extreme reces
sions ranged from 4 to almost 10
points, motors reacted 3 to 7, ship
pings 2 to almost 8, steels and kindred
equipments 2 to 7, and leathers, tex-j
tiles, tobaccos and food shares 2 to 8
point3., ,
Rails held better than r.hy other
branch of the list, the setback in that
quarter, save among a few secondary
or minor issues, running from 1 to 2
points. Sales, 1,475,000 shares.
Bonds as a whole, including Liberty
and foreign issues, eased slightly on
a relatively light turnover. Total
sales, par value, $11,600,000. Old Uni
ted States bond 3 were unchanged on
call.
THE GRAIN MARKETS
CHICAGO, June 16. All deliveries
of corn rose today to the highest
prices yet this season. Persistent buy
ing on country account furnished most,
of the energy. There -was a strong
close at 3c to 4c net advance with
July $1.76 to $1.77 and September
$1.70 to $1.70. Oats gained 2c to
4c. Provisions finished at 10c ad
vance to 40c decline. - 1
It was a big broad market in corn
throughout the day, with bullish senti
ment plainly In control from the start
Belief that the new crop was not going
to turn out right and that old stocks
would be exhausted seemed to be back
of many of the orders to purchase. Be
sides, the fact that hog values had
jumped to $26.71, the topmost figures
ever ' known, operated as a further
stimulus. The only important reaction
came shortly after midday and was-
due to word that -a car of Argentine
corn had been received at St. Louis.
Selling on this report, however, was
quickly absorbed, and a rush to cover
was in full progress tcward the last.
Houses with country connections
were active buyers of oats as well as
of corn. December oats ascended to
a new high price record for tha sea
son. Realizing sales weakened provisions
despite the bulge in grain and hogs.

AMERICAN LEGION TO
HOLD CONVENTION IN
TUCSON JULY 11, 12
Plans are now being made to form
an Arizona branch of the American
Legion and a meeting of the former
members of the army, navy and ma-,
rine corps will be held in Tucson on
July 11 and 12 for the purpose of per
fecting the state organization.
More than 1000 delegates from ev
ery state "in the union and from prac
tically every congressional district,
who served in the war against Ger
many, met in St. Louis, Mo.f May 8,
9 and 10, and launched the American
Legion. These delegates confirmed
in SL Louis the action taken by th6
men of the A. E. F. at a caucus in
Paris last March when the initial
step in formation of this organization
for the men of the army, navy and
marine corps was taken.
The American Legion is a veterans'
organization. It's purpose, is non
political and non-partisan ; it will keep
alive the principles of justice, free
dom and democracy for which these
veterans fought and will preserve to
future generations the history and in
cidents of their participation in the
war. Also, it will cement and perpet
uate the ties of comradship formed
in the service
At the St. Louis caucus the dele
gates carefully avoided the enuncia
tion, of politics, feeling that such ac
tion should not be taken until that
portion of the Legion still in France
arrived home and could be consulted.
-' In about six months it is believed
that most of the men of the A. E. F.
will be home. Therefore, it was de
cided to hold a convention with them
at Minneapolis, Minn., on next Nov
ember 10, 11 and 12, making it' an
armistice celebration.
This is primarily an enlisted man's
organization. Many of the men who
have just lately returned from the A.
E. F. feel that they do not care to
have anything to do with the organi
zation because there were too many
officers mixed up in the Legion and
the majority of the charter members
were men who were in France only
a short time while those who 'were
first overseas are still ia Germany in
the army of occupation and have had
no opportunity to have a voice in the
Legion so that many of the men who
saw the longest service in . France
have' had no opportunity to learn of
the Legion and its purpose.
But the majority of the delegates at.
St. Louis were from the ranks and at
least sixty per -cent of the delegates
to the November convention must be
enlisted men. Also it i3 an organiza
tion in which those men who were
not fortunate enough to get over seas
or have recently been discharged from
camps in the state should enroll in
the Legion at once. If you will for
ward your name, former organization
and home address to E. P. Conway,
state secretary, Noll Building, Phoe
nix, he will furnish you with complete
information about the St. Louis cau
cus and tell you how to join the Le
gion, and all about the convention at
Tucson.
RAT FUR MAY BECOME
FASHION IN COATS
LONDON, June 16. Rat fur may
figure largely in linings for coats and
trimmings for dresses and suits. The
skins, furriers say, will give a fining
better than may now be had in coats
which cost from 1200 to $300. Such
a market for rat skins would help in
the extermination of the" rodent.
