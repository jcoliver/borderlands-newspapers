GERMANY AS A MEMBER OF GROUP OF NATIONS AROUND THE

BY WHAT ACTUALLY HAPPENS AT THE PEACE TABLE BUT BY

FULL JUSTICE CAN INVOLVE NO DISCRIMINATION

SUCH A THING IS IMPOSSIBLE, BUT MUST BE GUARANTEED
BECAUSE THERE WILL BE FARTIE3 TO THE PACT WHOSE PROM
ISES HAVE PROVED UNTRUSTWORTHY. "FOR IT WOULD BE FOL

SEEN DESTROY RUSSIA"
NEW YORK, Sept. 27. The price of peace will be im
partial justice to all nations, the instrumentality indispensable
to secure it ii a league of nations formed not before or after,
but at the peace conference ; and Germany, as a member, "will
have to redeem her character not by what happens at the peace
table, but by what follows."
-This was President Wilson's answer, given tonight before
an audience of fourth Liberty loan workers here to the recent
peace talk from the central powers, although he did not refer
specifically to the utterances of enemy leaders.
Peace was not a question, declared the president, of
"coming to terms" for "we cannot 'come to terms' with
them," as "they have made it impossible. Peace must be
guaranteed, for "there will be parties to the peace whose prom
ises have proved untrustworthy and means must be found in
connection with the peace settlement to remove that source of
insecurity."
"It would be folly to leave the guarantee to the subse
quent voluntary action of the governments we have seen de
stroy Russia and deceive Rumania," continued the president.
The
prcsmet emphasized tnat the
justice to be obtained by the league
must involve no discrimination to
ward P.ny people. This he set forth
explicitly in a set of five principles
which be enumerated as the ''practical
program" of America's peace terms,
pnd f r the maintenance of which "the
T'riiterJ Stctes is preparer! to assume
its full share of reponsibili'y."
These principles were, he said:
First, the impartial justice meted i French offensives on the western

GRAIN MARKET.
CHICAGO. Sept 27. Severe breaks
in the price of corn resulted today
from Bulgarian efforts for an armis
tice. After setbacks that reached 5c
a bushel, the market closed nervous,
3Mc to 4-c net lower, with October
at $1.42i to $1.42, and November
at $1.4014 to $1.40.
Oats finished "mc to l&c to lc
down. The outcome in provisions va
ried from 15c decline to 17c advance.
General selling in the corn market
took place from the outset, but it was
not until the final half hour that th9
most acute weakness developed.
Doubt as to whether the action of
the Bulgarian premier in speaking
peace had been fully authorized and
as to whether his move was not a
trick to gain time for the Bulgarian
troops, did much to retard the descent
of values. At no time, however, did
the market react to any Important ex
tent. Temporary upturns which were
noted came from profit .taking shorts,
and did not change the prevailing
bearish sentiment. Other factors than
the armistice received but little at
tention, especially after confirmation
of the proposal seemed complete.
Oats sympathized with the weak
ness of corn. Government and export
buying, though, checked the decline.
Higher quotations on hogs gave
strength to provisions, but the weak
ness of corn finally became an offset.

ed crumbling of Germany's lesser al
lies is at hand.
Collapse of Bulgarian resistance
would be of tremendous military ad
vantage to the entente and might
quickly affect the attitude of Turkey.
Neutral diplomats In Washington ap
peared, if possible, even more impress
ed by this prospect than the represen
tatives of the allies. They spoke of
the Turkish debacle In Palestine and
predicted that overtures from the Ot
toman government might be expected.
Some even went so far as to express
the opinion that since Bulgaria has
dared to defy her master, Germany's
more powerful colleague, Austria, may
gather courage to disregard German
pressure and come out with an unqual
ified proposal for cessation of hostili
ties. The United States is not at war
with Bulgaria and the Bulgarian min
ister occupies his legation here. There
fore directly and formally the Ameri
can government has nothing to do
with the proposal made to the French
general commanding the allies in
Macedonia. Actually, however, the
Bulgarian affair must be considered
as an important phase of the world
war situation so the announcement
from Paris that not only the entente
governments, but the United States
must be consulted before Bulgarian
proposals are considered, was not sur
prising. If the Bulgarians really are ready
to quit the war on the entente's terms
there Is little doubt that her offers will
be etnertalned. There will be no
"round table" peace discussions, how
ever, with opportunities for secret
German machinations to confuse the
Issue and bring about such a situation
as It was hoped to create through the
recent proposal from Austria. The al
lies all along have indicated a deter
mination to deal separately and Inde
pendently with each of the countries
with which they are at war when it
came to peace negotiations and if Bul
garia can meet the teBt of sincerity
the time has come when she may find
safety in dropping out of the alliance
with the central powers. The Berlin !
version describing the request for an
armistice as a coup by Premier Malin
noff without support from king, cabi
net or army, apparently was complete
ly disposed of by the report of the
French general commanding in Mace
donia that the peace envoys were the
Bulgarian minister of finance and the
general commanding the second army.
Military men already are thinking
of what might be done with both Bul
garia and Turkey out of the war and
under allied surveillance.
Entente forces might open the Tmr
denelles and the Black sea to their
warships and transports, and prepare
the way for the re-establishment of
the armies on the eastern front, thus
surrounding the Germanic powers
with an Iron ring comparable to that
through which they broke when Rus
sia collapsed. It Is hoped that Ruma

From Palestine toPicardy
The narrative of events now. transpir
ing in Palestine sounds like the chanting
of the first verses of the book of Genesis.
The taking of the ancient Syrian seaport
of Acre by the British marks an epoch even
in the stupendous events of the great war.
Consider, Acre was first besieged by the
crusaders in the year 1 1 00. It was taken
by Godfry de Boullion and the other leaders
of the first crusade and held for some eighty
years, then it was retaken by the Saracens.
Then, just four years later, or in 1 1 9 1 , to be
exact Richard of the Lion Hearted, leader
of the third crusade, re-took the city for the
Christians, and while Richard failed to con
quer the Holy Sepulcher from the infidels
at Jerusalem, his conquest of Acre remain
ed a Christian possession for one hundred
years before again passing to Saracen
hands. The great Napoleon was the next
leader to appear before the gates of' Acre
and demand it3 surrender in l 800. The city,
defended by the British forces, held out
against Bonaparte for two months, when
he was forced to raise the siege. The Turks
secured possession of Acre in 1 832, and
in 1 840 it was bombarded by a British
fleet, but it remained in Turkish hands
from that time until last week when Gen
eral Allenby's cavalry stprmed it with a
sudden rush.
The taking of Acre affords the British
fleet a much better harbor on the Mediter
ranean than that at Jaffa.
Damascus, seventy miles northeast of
Acre, is the next objective of the British
army. Then, due north from Damascus
one hundred and fifty miles lies Aleppo, a
most important city, and the natural junc
tion point of the Palestine and Mesopotania
forces; also the key to Alexandria, one
of the best harbors and largest ports of all
the east coast of the Mediterranean sea. It
is from Alexandretta that the real drive on
Constantinople will begin.
That the British will soon take Damascus
there is no doubt. This ancient city stands
at the head of the great desert and is the
metropolis of all this section of Palestine
and Syria. Its capture will mark the pass
ing of the Turk from the Holy Land and
will cost him his richest and most treas
ured possessions. The British have already
passed over the immortal field of Arma
geddon. In fact every mile of ground now
being conquered by this modern army was
a battle ground for contending forces a
thousand years before Alfred the Great or
ganized England into a nation from savage
and warring tribes of barbarians. Joshua
and Saul and David and Joab and Abner
and Jashobeam each fought in his turn on
this ground where General Allenby's men
now press on. The Man of Sorrows taught
and healed in these places. The armies of
Alexander the Great and those of many
Persian and Greek and Roman conquerers
swept over this section, for Syria has al
ways been the gate and the portal for
every wave of conquest that -has flowed or
ebbed between Asia and Europe. Time
was when Syrian cities along this coast
were most rich and wonderful and fair to
see. Groves and palaces and magic gar
dens dotted the slopes. But all these have
been buried and forgotten for many hun
dreds of years and the woodcutter and the
sheep herder have done their part to aid
time in the changing cf one of the world's
fairest and most fruitful sections to a miser
able and desert place.
But these two British armies, the one in
Mcsopatania and the one in Palestine, they
are spearheads that are surely piercing the
vitals of German's 'plan of far eastern con
quest and greatness. For the first time in
the war Germany faces the real danger of
the loss of her allies, Turkey and Bulgaria.
S':e rannol Ion:.; survive their dismember
ment fiom ihh unholy alliance. With their
pairing. hhaUeri'd Austria must turn and
defend her eastern and southern borders.
Germany cannot spare a man from her hard
pressed western front to help. Where are
the German troops that blasted the way
through Serbia and crushed Rumania and
pushed the Italians back to the brink of dis
aster? They sleep the long sleep at Armen
tiers and Noyon and Mt. Kemmel and Al
bert and on the banks of the Somme and
the Marne. No more need the east and the
far east tremble at the sound of the Prus
sian bugle call. No more can the Haps
burgs and the sultan and saturnine Ferdi
nand of Bulgaria call for Prussian aid with
any hope of response. The indomitable
British Tommy and the sturdy and gallant
Poilu have seen to that. And those lean,
eager doughboys from across the western
seas are adding their hammer strokes to
the crumbling German anvil.
Never was there such an autumn as this ;
never one so glorious. Its golden leaves of
promise deck the slopes of the Mount of
Olives and the historic Greek plains and the
rugged Balkan peaks and the fair lands of
France. The events of Palestine and Mace
donia are but the inevitable results of the
cutting of the current from Berlin by the
pincers in the hands of Marshal Foch on
that decisive front of the war that stretches
in a sheet of flame from Ypres to Lor
raine.
Bulgaria
Contrast, if you can, the spirit of Bul
garia with that of Serbia. Under her first
defeat in the field Bulgaria is seeking peace.
Serbia, after a series of defeats that drove
her out of every square mile of her country,
still fought on without a sign of weakness
or despair. With Bulgaria out of the war
the effects will be immediate upon Austria
and Russia and may well bring about the
collapse of the former. With Bulgaria out
of it, this would mean an eastern front at
once that would force the recall of many
German divisions from the west to save
Austria. But there will be no peace with
the Bulgar except by terms that are just
to Serbia and Greece. He will have to prac
tically disarm upon unconditional terms,
depending entirely upon the justice and fair
dealing and humanity of the allies and at
that, this would be the very best thing Bul
garia can do, and the only thing to save
herself from disaster.
Has anybody heard directly from Colter
since the primary! After such a victory it
was to be expected that the democratic
nominee would be much in evidence with
his words and song. But so far he has not
even answered the querry of State Chair
man Stoneman who checked the matter of
his disqualification squarely up to him.
However, his friends declare he will stand
pat and run. The democrats of Arizona will
face a strange and complex situation when
they go to the polls in November to vote
for a candidate who is barred by the state
constitution from holding the office in
which their ballots are to place him.
Two and one-half millions for Cochise;
that is the fiat of the powers that be in the
matter of the Fourth Liberty loan. Sounds
big, looks big, IS big, but no one is dis
mayed. Not a murmur of doubt or forebod
ing was heard yesterday in the Warren
district. Everything is ready to start the
big drive today. They're off now! And
there will be no faltering or slowing down
until the finish line is crossed and the judges
raise the winner's flag for Old Cochise!
Senator Gore of Oklahoma, notorious as
a pacifist ever since the great war began,
was refused permission to speakj at the
democratic state convention in Oklahoma
recently. The question of whether this mis
representative of the people should speak
or not was voted upon by county delega
tions. His own county unit voted loudly
and unanimously against such an insult to
a great state convention. Unfortunately
Gore is a hold over and his home people
cannot get to him this year. Every paci
fist senator of the present congress, . ex
cept one, (Norris of Nebraska, and he must
face the November election) who has faced
his people at the primaries this year has
been beaten. Arizona has a pacifist con
gressman in the person of Carl Hayden who
was renominated without opposition by the
democrats, no one knows why, for there is
plenty of splendid congressional material
in the democratic party of the state. But
Hayden is opposed by a republican candi
date who is now fighting in France, Tom
Maddox by name, and it is yet to be seen
if Arizona is not patriotic enough to go on
record against mis-representntives. Her
U. S. senators, grand old Mark Smith, and
the eloquent Ashurst, have always s'ood
sturdily and strong for the war.
Y.W.C.A. WORK IS
EXPLAINED WELL
"Anions the great organizations
which are taking part in this national
war fund campaign, the Y. W. C. A.,
considered individually, is doing won
derful work, and will continue to do
so until the successful termination of
the war." said Mrs. Bowie in her
speech Thursday at the auditorium
of the V. M. C. A. before a large audi
ence. Mrs. Bowie further added that
the V V. C. A. In connection with
war work is covering a field of wide
range, and many interests are foster
ed and sheltered by it.
"Many people are familiar," said
Mrs. Bowie, "with the work of the
Blue Triangle or the Y. W.,' and know
what it is doing over there, ai.d like
wise doing in the training camps over
here. When the boys went in khakl
the Red Triangle followed and when
the women mobilized the Blue Trian
gle also enlisted."
Mrs. Bowie clearly defined how .the
work of the organization is carried on
through close co-operation of the war
work council which gives every con
sideration to the many trials and dif
ficulties with which girls working in
the various munitions factories must
endure. Another problem which also
receives the attention of the war work
council, through the Y. W., is that of
the organization of clubs for girls
where they might find the recreation
that is absolutely necessary for them
after their work In the factories. The
work or the colored girls in the manu
facturies of the government is also
carefully looked after by the organi
zation, as is likewise the work for
foreign speaking women to whom, are
given educational advantages.
"One of the brightest spots in the
camp," stated Mrs. Bowie, "is the host
ess house, which not only maintains
its popularity with the men in service,
but which is also the homey spot
where hundreds of persons have en
joyed hospitality.
Everything is done for the good of
those who are at the hostess house
and those who have once visited one
have .in inclination to spend more
time there. The hostess house work is
being carried through in every army
rantonment. They are never con
structed unless the orders of the com
manding officer have been received
and in every case the hostess house
has proven to be a great success and
an absolute necessity for our men at
the camps. The sanctity of home and
the preciousness of close ties are al
ways manifest within them.
At present there are ninety-one hoot
ess houses in the United States, built
on the direct request of the command
er of each cantonment camp.
Hostess houses and recreational cen
ters are maintained in France for
American women war relief workers.
Signal corps girls with the American
army, the Red Cross nurses at base
hospitals, and most appealing of all
for the brave French women munition
wcrkers who for four long years have
produced the war supplies which have
kept the French army fighting for
their own freedom and world democracy.
County News
In the superior court yesterday the
case of the State vs. James E. Kelly,
charged with assault with a deadly
weapon, was dismissed by the county
attorney on grounds of insufficient evidence.
W. J. Nemeck, chief of the Douglas
fire department, is again at the post
after an illness of about two weeks,
during which time he was confined
at the county hospital, where he un
derwent an operation.
The death of Charles T. Candy of
Willcox, is charged to a whirlwind,
which struck his home in such a man
ner as to overthrow a loaded shot
and the charge of shot entered Ganuy
gun. The weapon was discharged,
and the charge of shot entered dan
dy's back, as he lay on a cot, lodging
near the heart.
I?w tn snlerdid condition. Dr. A. C.
Carlson says that there is no donger
of Carlson being even slightly lame
in the left leg after the bone knits.
WHanis: A German who gave his
name as A. Wilson, after being ar
rested at Williams because of his
queer actions, cut his throat from ear
to ear with a penknife. He died in
a hospital several hours later, cursing
President Wilson and praying for
blessings on the kaiser. It is believed
that Wilson was a German spy. A scar
on his left leg indicates that he may
have served in the war. Before his
orrest Wilson told some railroad men
that soldiers and army officeri were
after him.
The continued drouth is making the
ranges look like a blanket of some
breakfast food. The seriousness of
the present drouth is multiplying as
the days roll by. The weather prog
r.ostigators predict a long cold win
ter, which generally means lots of
snow and rain in this part of Arizona.
Ashley Packard, assistant cashier
and director of the First National bank
of Douglas, is recovering very rapidly
from the effects of his recent opera
tion for appendicitis, and has been re
moved to his home. He will leave for
the Erickson ranch in the Sulphur
Springs valley in a few days to re
cuperate his health.
NEAR BATH RIOT.
(By Review L,e;isel Wire)
EI. PASO, Texas, Sept. 21. An of
litial investigation to fix the responsi
bility for the misunderstanding at the
international bridge today, which came
near causing a "bath riot" similar to
that of 19 IK, was started here late to
day. Mexican officials claimed that
federal employes at the bridge used
abusive language toward Mexicans
while enforcing a new regulation that
all persons who did not have a bath
certificate should pass through the
fumigation and bath station on the
American side. This order w as issued
because it was reported to the United
.Mates health officers that a case of
typhus had developed in Juarez.
This report was later denied. A
crowd of Mexican laborers and serv
ants gathered at the Mexican end of
the bridge and mounted policemen
from Juarez were sent there to pre
sent troble. A street car from El Paso
was stoned in Juarez and the trolley
removed, but no Americans were
harmed. The misunderstanding was
explained at noon, the JJuarez port
was reopened and street car traffic
resumed.

Harrison's slayer, but this was later
disproved. After the shooting of
Harrison officers formed a posse to

PRESIDENT IN HIS SPEECH AT
NEW YORK EMPHASIZES NEED OF
LEAGUE OF NATIONS TO ENFORCE IT
(Contlnued from Page Out)
night to try to make it clear once more j
what the war really means. You will j
need no other stimulation or reminder
of your duty.
At every turn of the war we pain a
fresh consciousness of what we mean
to accomplish by it. When our hope
and expectations are most excited we
think more definitely than before of
the issues that hang upon it and of
the purposes which must be realized
by means of it. For it has positive and
well denned purposes which we did
not determine and which we cannot
alter. No statesman or assembly cre
ated them; no statesman or assembly
can alter them. They have arisen out
of the very nature and circumstances
of the war. The most that statesmen
or assemblies can do is to carry them
out or be false to them. They were
perhaps not clear at the outset; but
they are clear now. The w ar has last
ed more than four years and the
whole world has been drawn into it.
The common will of mankind has been
substituted for the particular purposes .
of individual states. Individual states
men may have started the conllict,
but neither they nor their opponents
can stop it as tuey please. It has be
come a people's war and peoples of all
sorts and races, of every degree of
power and-variety of iortune are in-1
voivea in us sweeping processes oi
change and settlement. We came into
ii ue-u us cuuiauier u.u ueeome iu,., j
ueiuieu ami It as plain ui no ua-j
tion could stand apart or be intliHer-1

drove to the heart of everything we
cared for and lived for. Our brothers
from many lands, as well as our own
murdered dead under the sea were
.oi"v.vU, ...v
ly anu oi course. i
The air was clear about us. We saw
things in their full, convincing propor-
tions as they were; and we have seen
them with steady eyes and unchanging
comprehension ever since. We ac
cepted the issues of the war as facts,
not as any group of men either here
or elsewhere had defined them, and we
can accept no outcome which dues not
squarely meet and settle them. Those
issues are these:
Shall the military power of any na-1
tion or group of nations be guttered j
to determine the fortunes of peoples I
over whom they have no right to rule i
except the right of force?
I
free to i
Shall strong nations be
wrong weak nations and make them
subject to their purpose and interests."
Shall peoples be ruled and dominat
ed, even in their own internal affairs
by arbitrary and irresponsible force or ;
by their own will and choice?
Shall there be a common standard
of right and privilege'for all peoples
and nations or shall the strong do as
they will and the weak sufter with
out redress?
Shall the assertion of right be hap
hazarded and by casual alliance or
shall there be a common concert to
oblige the observance of common
rights? .
No man, no group of "men, chose
these to be the issues of the struggle.
They are the issues of it; and they i
must be settled by no arrangement
or compromise or adjustment of inter
ests but definitely and once for all
and with a full and unequivocal ac
ceptance of the principle that the in
terest of the weakest is as sacred as
the interest of the strongest.
This is what we mean when we
speak of a permanent peace, if v.e!,nl warning against entangling aiu-
sieak sincerely, intelligently and with!
a real knowledge anu comprenension
of the matter we deal with.
Permanent Peace
We are all agreed that there can be
no peace obtained by any kind of bar
gain or compromise with the govern
ments of the central empires because
we have dealt with them already anJ
have seen them deal with other gov
ernments that were parties to this
struggle, at Brest Litcvtk and Bucha
rest. They have convinced us that they
arc without honor and tin not intend
juslice. '1 hey observe no cjvi nauts,
accept no principle but force and
their own interest. We cannot come
to teims wilh them. They have lince
it impossible. The German people
must by this time be fully aware that
we cannot accept the word oi lh;se
who forced this war upen us. We do
not think the same thougnts or speak
the same language of agreement.
It is of capital importance that we
should be explicit; agreea that no
peace snail oe ooiamea oy unj hinu
of compromise or abatement of the. 1
principles we have avowed as the pnn-
cipies ror mcn we are i.mii.ag. ineie;as ,,ia;y as jf in !oii3 unvarnished
should e:.ist no doubt about them. 1 : urnis
am. therefore, going to take the lib-) As", ,avL. .iai(I neither I nor any
erty ot speak.ng w.ln trio utmost ;
frankness about the practical implica
tions that are involved in it.
If it be md td and in truth the
common object of tho governments as
sociated against Germany and of the
nations whom they govern, as I believe !
it to !jC, to achieve by the coming s''
tlemciits a secaie and lui-tirg peace,
it will be necessary that all wno sit i

V'er ;eiy will have lo re.Ji in In r e'1.1

And. as I see it. die 1 uu.,' it in ii n ,
of that league ot natl rn arl the , ,
detini'lon ot its objec's must be a i
part, is iu a sense the most essentia! j
pari of the peace settlement itself.
It cannot be I'olined now. If formed
now it would be merely a new alliance
confined to the nations associated
against a common enemy. It is not
likely that it could be formed after
the settlement. It is necessary to
guarantee the peace; and the peace
cannot be guaranteed as an after
thought. Tho reason, to speak in plain
j (erllls again why it must 5e guaran
teed that there will be parties to the
peace whose promises have proved
untrustworthy and means must be
found iu connection with the peace
settlement itself to remove that source
of insecurity. It would be lolly to
leave the guatantec to the subsequent
voluntary action of tho governments
we have seen destroy Russia and de
ceive Rumania.
But these general terms do not dis
close the whole matter. Some details
are needed to make them sound less
like a thesis and more like a practical
nrni'raiii i l'.f Ihun a ro umi.n r.t
lne pdrK.uiar8 and , 8'ale tUem WItn
the greater conlidence because 1 can
state them authoritatively as re pre
Bentjllg tnis governments interpret
tion of its own duty with regard to
peace:
First, the impartial justice meter
QUt mu;t involve no aiscrimination be
tween those to whom we wish to be
Just and those to whom we do not
wjsn to be just u must be g juslice
tnat plavs no favorites and knows no
8tandard but the equal Hght8 of lhe
; 8eVeral peoples concerned.
: Secondi no 8pecial or separate inter.
eg, of single nation or an
i, natiOM can be niade the basl3 m
j any part of (ne 8ettiement wbit.a ls
not con818teiit with the common mter-
ests of all.
Third, there can be no leagues or
alliances or special covenants and un
perstandings with the general and
common family of the league of na
tions. Fourth, and more specifically, there
can be no special, selfish economic
combinations within the league and
no employment of any form of econ
omic boycott or exclusicn except as
the power of economic of penalty by
exclusion from the markets oi the
world may be vested in the league of
nations itself as a means of discipline
ard control.
t nth, all international agreements
and treaties of every kind must be
made known, in their entirety to the
rest of tho world.
Special alliances and economic riv
alries and hostilities have been tne
prolific curse in the modern world cl
the plans and passions that produce
war. It would be an insincere as well
as an insecure peace that did not ex
clude them in definite and binding
terms.
The confidence with which I ven
ture to speak for our people in these
matters does not spring from our tra
ditions merely and the well known
principles of international action
which we have-always professed and
followed. In the same sentence in
which I say that the United States
w'" enter into no special airange
ments or understandings with particu
lar nations let me say also that the
United States i8 prepared to assume
its full share ot responsibility for the
maintenance ot the common covenants
and understandings upon which peace
must henceforth rest.
We wi l read Washington's immor-
antts W1U1 Iuu comprenension ana
i n answering purpose. But only spe
cial and limited alliances entangle,
and ve recognize and accept the duty
of a ne day ir. wnich we are permit
ted to hope for 2 general alliance
wnLh will avoid entanglements and
t!e.:i the air of the world for common
nndeistr.ndinns and the maintenance
if ci.iamen rights.

avi so thankful tor what it has
d'tn for ni.
mote and more vivid and unmistaka-
b e outline.
: draw into closer and clo-itr array, or-
t-diiize their millions into more and'
more unconquerable uiilit. as they be-1
i one moie and nor. oisfict to tne '
thought and purpose of the peoples
engaged. It is tne peculiarity of this
great war that while statesmen have
seemed to cast about for definitions of
their purpose and have some times
seemed to shift their ground aud their!
point of view, the tnougiit of the majs
of men, whom statesmen are sup
posed to instruct and lead, has grown
more and more unclouded, more and
more certain of what it is that they
j are fighting for. National purposes
nave ia.ien more anil more lino me
background and the common purpose
of enlightened mankind has taken
their place. The counsels of plain
men have become on all hands more
simple and straightforward and more
unilied than the counsels of sophisti
cated men of affairs who still retain
tne impression that they are playing
a game of power and playing for high
stakes. That is why 1 have said that
this is the people's war, not a states
men's. Statesmen must follow the
clarilied common thought or be brok
en. I take that to be the significance
oi tne tact mat assemoiies anu asso-
ciations of many kinds made up of
iiiain, workaday people, have demand- j
ed, almost every time they came to- j
gether and are still demanding, that!
the leaders of their governments de-!
dare to them plainly what it is, exact-j
nui it is, inai iney are seeKins
in this war. and what they think the
items of the final settlement should
be. They are not yet satisfied with
wnut they have been told. They still
seem to fear they are getting what
they ask for only in statesmen's terms
only in the terms of territorial ar
rangements and divisions of power,
and not in terms of broad visioned jus
tice and mercy and peace and the
satisfaction of those deep seated long
ings of oppressed and distracted men
and wemen and enslaved peoples that
seem to have the only things worth
lighting a war for that engulfs the
world. Perhaps statesmen have not
always recognized this changed aspect
of the whole world of policy and ac
tion. Perhaps they have not always
spoken in direct reply to the questions
.isked because they did not know how
searching those questions were and
wnat sort of answers they demanded.
But I, for one, am glad to attempt I
the answer again and again, in the (
iiepe that I may make it clearer and j
clearer that my one thought is to sat-i
isfy those who struggle in the ranks
and are perhaps above all others en
titled to a reply whose meaning no!
one can have any excuse for misun !
derstanding, If he understands the I
anguase in which it is spoken or can j
get some to translate it correctly into i
cis own. And I believe that the lead-:
era of the governments with whicii !
we are associated will speak, as they ,
have occasion, as plainly as I have j
tried to speak. I hope that they will j
(eel free to say whether they think I
that I am in any degree mistaken iu
my interpretation of the issues involv-,
ed or in my purpose with regard to
the means by which a satisfactory set- j
tlement of these issues may be ob-1
tained. Unity of purpose and of coun- j
sel are as imperatively necessary in J
this war as was unity of command on ;
the battle field, and with perfect unity j
of purpose aud counsel will come as
surance of complete victory. It can
be had in no other way.
Peace drives can be effectively neu- j
tralized and silenced only by showing I
that every victory of the nations as-i
sociated aSinst Germany brings the j
nations nearer the sort of peace which ;
will bring security and reassurance to!
all peoples and make the recurrence
of another struggle of pitiless force I
and bloodshed forever impossible, and
that nothing else can. Germany is;
constantly intimating the "terms" she I
wiil accept, and always finds that the
world does not want terras. It wishes
the final triumph of justice and fair
dealings.

ready to enter ranks of state's corper

Xight classes at the Hi-Y course
are proving more popular daily with
numerous additional enrollments re
ported durinng the past week by Prof.
Bowles.
Much interest is being manifested
in the new classes to start next week.
These include geology, radio buzzer,
advanced accounting and additional
Spanish and French classes. The rea
son for adding to the Spanish and
French classes is that the number
of pupils has increased so rapidly that
it was found necessary to divide the
class into two sections.
The advanced accountinng course
will be in charge of S. S. Safford and
the opening class will take place Tues
day night from 7:20 to 9 and the sec
ond class will be on Thursday night
at the same hour. This class will meet
at the Y. M. C. A.
Mr. Cunningham wijl have charge
of the Spanish class to be held at the
Y. M. C. A. Those now studying this
subject as well as all who desire to
enter the class for beginners and the
advanced Spanish class should report
at the high school at the regular
nights, Monday, Tuesday, Thursday
and Friday until notified to change.
Mr. Fuechere will have charge cf the
beginners' French class at the Y. .M.
C. A. at 7:20 to 8:10 on TuesdtM- and
Thursday. The advanced Frenclficlass
at the Y will be on the same nights
from 6:30 to 7:30.
The radio buzzer class with Mr.
Powell at the helm will meet Wednes
day and Friday night from 6: HO to 9.
J. IJ. Tenney will teach the gelology
class which is scheduled for 7:30 to
9 on Wednesday and Friday.
All of the above classes will meet
in the lounge room and class room
of the Y. M. C. A. while other sub
jects will continue to be taught at the
high school nightly. There is also a
beginners French class at the Y. W.
C. A. Tuesday and Thursday ldghts
at 6:3010 7:20.
Those desiring to study advanced
English should hand in their names
to Profwssor Howies at once.
The auto repairing class has not
started yet due to the inability to se
cure a teacher with practical experi
ence to handle the subject. Just us
soon as possible a teacher will be
engaged and an announcement will
be made as to class nights at the Y.

Sunday, Oct. 27, is the day for
turning the clock back an hour, ac-
i cording to the federal law enacted
I'-v eenL-ress March 19. 191S. Wrdnes
i day morning. The law, after reciting
I tti limits of the time zones, in section
I :;, reads:
I "At 2 o'clock, antemeridian, of the
i last Sunday in March each year.
(Al ircn 31, 1'JlS) t:ie standard time of
ta.-ii ?onp sn;ill be cdvanced one hour,
; and at 2 o'clock, antemeridian, of the
! lust Sunday in October ii each year
(Oct. 27. JPIS ). tiie standard time of
each zone ihall. by t':e retarding of
one hour, be returned to the mean
astrunoniicai tirr.e of the degree of
longitude governing the said zone."
The law is known throughout the
allied m-.'i::ns as the daylight saving
law and was designed to cause earlier
rising by Americans during the long
days, and a saving in bills for arti
ficial lighting. Many Arizona people
have noticed that their electric light
bills rt home were less than in for
mer months.
