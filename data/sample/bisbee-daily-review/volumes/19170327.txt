tente allies is one of the important
problems to he taken up.
The order to increase the marine
corps from its present authorized
maximum of 14,981 to 17,400 was an
nounced by Secretary Daniels in the
Joffowing -statement, telegraphed to
newspaper editors whose aid In find
ing the men in sought:
Call to Recruits
"The President has signed an
executive order directing that the
authorized strength of the marine
corps be increased to 17,400 men.
He was authorized by congress,
in case of emergency to direct
such increase in enlistment.
Marine Corps Duties
"The United States marine
corps is the soldier branch of our
'first line of defense.' Marines
serve both ashore and afloat and
are trained as infantry, heavy
and light artillery, and machine
gun companies. They form the
landing parties from ships of the
navy, are the first men detailed
for expeditionary duty, and de
fend all naval bases. Each capi
tal ship of the navy carries one
company of marines. There has
been a net increase of over 3.000
In the strength of the corps since
congress recently authorized an
Increase but more than 4,000
more are needed and needed now.
"Will you please emphasize
the need of this important branch
of our naval service by giving
special prominence in your paper
to the President's order?
Offers Opportunities
"The marine corps offers excep
tional opportunities to young men
of grit and ambition to serve
their country in the first line of
defense.
"In this emergency you have
the opportunity and privilege of
performing this public service
and I am confidently appealing to
you for your cordial and helpful
cooperation."
25,000 Needed
' To give the navy 87.000 bluejackets
and add the marines needed, more
than 25,000 men must be recruited.
While Mr. Daniels was discussing
the new order with newspaper repre
sentatives. President Wilson walked
Into the secretary's office unannounc
ed. He took a seat to await the con
clusion of the newspaper conference
and was an interested spectator for
several minutes before anyone knew
he was tn the room. There was con
tinued discussion today for the mot
ive of the wax department in trans
ferring Major General General Wood
to the new southeastern department
from his present post in command of
the eastern department. Secretary
Baker again refused to discuss the
matter and no explanation was forth
coming from any other source that
fixed the action as more than a ques
tion of administrative routine.
Germans Safe Here
Mr. Baker took occasion during the
day to confirm the impression that
the government Is planning to deal lib
erally with German or other foreign
subtects resident in the United States
in the evnt of war.
.Even Reservis's Safe
"AH resident aliens." he said, "who
are obedient to our laws will be per
fectlv safe from interference." Asked
if this anplied to German army re
servists, the secretary said:

In other quarters it was indicated
that German residents might be reg-;

istered in the event of war, in order Ithat the difficulties placed in the way!
that the government could have swmelof the American's transfer out of Ger-
knowledge of their movements and
make certain that no person guilty of
misconduct shall escape justice.
Another phase of national prepar
edness prompted Mr. Baker to volun-
teer a suggestion as to the course
which men and women who are seek
ing an opportunit to serve their coun
try might follow. Every day has
brought several score of letters to his
desk asking how personal service
might be rendered.
Mr. Baker pointed out that the reg-
fur-'.ular army, national guard, and offi
-
cers reserve corps orierea opportuni-
ties to men who desired military ser-
Tice. The reserve, he explained, of-
fered a wide field of choice since taw
iau corps uivisious were composed
of men specially trained in civil life
tn the work they would perform In
war time. In addition to this, the
secretary added, the mobilization of
dci n-co at iuc uauvu B uidpuobi, i
The plan being worked out, be add-
ed, was the coordination of every in-
a us try so that the government, thru
a small committee or organization,
could put its hand upon any part of
the widespread activities. He urged
that men get into touch with their
associates in trade so that the com
mittee groups would be able to speak
for all elements of any trade or in
dustry when the time came for gov
ernment service.
Tasks For Women
For women, many of whom have
been included in bis correspondents,
the secretary suggested affiliation
with the local agencies organized to
enroll the women power of the nation
The National security League, the
itauonai woman suffrage Association
j and the National Association of Wom
an 8 clubs be said, were all engaged
in this work and the defense council,
to which their services have been of
fered, has arranged that each shall
cover a separate field.
Skilled Labor Wanted
As to the place skilled labor may
find In the movement to meet the '
emergency, Mr. Baker said the de-
partment of labor and the civil ser-1
vice commission were cooperating in
securing such men for the govern
ment's arsenals and navy yards. Any
mechanic seeking a place in the pre
paredness program, he added, could
readily find his opportunity through
either of these agencies.

business stroke for the faYmer this

Since the policy of stimulating food

thta congress alone can deal with this

WASHINGTON, Mar. 26 Ger-'
mny's "clear violations" of the
treaties of 1799 and 1823 and her
"disregard of the canons of inter,

by the United States as reasons
for refusal to re-affirm or extend

refusal to Germany transmitted
through Dr. pau Ritter, the Swiss
minister, was made public today
by the state department and dis
closes that this government "is

these violations for the attention of

Some Violations
"Since the sinking of the American
ship Win. P. Frye for the carriage of
contraband, there have been perpe
trated by the German naval forces
similar unwarranted attacks upon and
destruction of nu nitrous American
vessels, for the reason as alleged,
that they were engaged in the trans
portation of articles of contraband
notwithstanding and in disregard of
article thirteen of the treaty of 1TSS
that 'no such articles (of contraband t
carried in the vessels or by the ships
of either party shall be deemed con
traband so as to induce confiscation
or condemnation and a loss of proper
ty to individuals. And that in case
of a vessel stopped for articles of con
traband, if the master of the vesse?
stopped will deliver out tbe goods
supposed to be c.f contraband natnif.
be shall be admitted to do it and the
vessel shall not in that ae be car
ried into any port or further detained
but shall be allowed to proceed on
her voyage."
More Broken Promises
"In addition to tbe sinking of Am
erican vessels, foreign int reliant ves
sels carrying American citizens and
American property have been sunk
by German submarines without warn
ing and without and adequate securi
ty for the safety of the persons on
board or compensation fcr the de
st ruction of property by such action,
notwithstanding the solemn encase
ments of article fifteen of the treaty
of 1799 that "all persons belonging to
any vessels of war. public or private,
who shall molest or insult in any
manner whatever the people, vessels
or effects of the other party, shall be

further stipulation of articles 12 of

U. S. Navy Offers
To Young Men
Serve Country
BY CHARLES F. WEBER,
Chief Quartermaster U. S. Navy.
N'j more effective service can be
rendered your country at thiE time
than to aid in the enlistment of men
required to fill the complement of the
United States navy, the tirst line of
defense. Approximately 25.000 young
men are needed now. , These men must
be trained, which requires months of
drilling. They must be tausht the
ways of the sea. for we have no mer
chant marine to draw upon, and they
must be taught military discipline, as
well as the duties "of the naval pro
fession. All this takes time; a vital factor
in the present crisis. For one hun
dred and forty years the United
States navy has had an unbroken rec
ord of honorable achievement. At
every critical period in our country's
history it has played an Important
and often most tlorious part. The
United States navy has ever been a
service Jf high ideals, and the lofty
standard raised by naval heroes, from
Paul Jones to Dewey, is zealously
maintained by officers and men today.
Confidence in Navy.
The American people place implicit
confidence in their navy and have a
justifiable pride in its accomplish
ments. No more patriotic can there
fore be rendered than to help make the

one of those instances where our foresightedness in merchandising
saves you the difference between our selling price, and what the shoes
would cost you' if bought in today's market.
We bought our 1917 Spring and Summer stocks of Mary Janes
about a year ago. they had already made a slight advance but we
knew they were going higher. You will profit by this early purtlia.se of

The law, however, permits men to ap

cember of any year alter they have
completed one full year at sea. The
pay is excellent when it is remember
ed that practically all living expenses
are borne by the government. The
vocational training afforded in the
navy is unequalled in any civil em
ployment; more than fifty trades be
ing utilized on board a man-o-war,
most of which ate taught wholly, or
in part, in naval trade schools.
It is an exiom that "no man who
has served in the navy leaves the
service without being far better equip
ped to earn his living than he was be
fore he enlisted." after serving an en
listment creditably, the saii'jr is
awarded an honorable discharge, "a
testimonial of fidelity and obedience,"
which is the highest recommendation
he can receive.

Miss Theda Kara, the eminent Fox

the Eaule in "The Darling of Paris."
has some well-defined 'opinions upon
the subject of pronunciation of words.
According to her observation, pronoun
ciation is in a Ereat measure arbitrary
pleurisy, rhcttma- and not Infrequently is exposed to the
ennrices jf fashion and taste. It in
liable to change from one age to an
other, and it varies more or less not
only in the different and distantly
separate countries in which is it '
spoken, hut also in the different divi
sions and districts in the same coun
try. I
Miss Bara points to the fact that the
East has a different pronounciation
from that of the West. Thp pronoun-!
ciation in New Eneland is different
from that of any other part of the
country, and the same can be said of
the South, yet the man who lives in
Charleston. S. C does not pronounce
Ms words nnlike the one who lives in
Boston.

Glter impurities fi'om the blood and

in many instances the bowels create

uses the skin pores as the next best

The surest way to clear the skin of

ADVERTISING VALUES.
Any newspaper, which has advertising space for Bale
and all have, must base its rates on some standard.
That basis, in practically every instance, is circulation.
The Bisbee Daily Review, at the present time, Is offering
for the consideration of all advertisers, who desire re
sults, the largest bona fide, paid in advance subscription
list, outside of Phoenix.
Careful advertisers ire not to be fooled. To get re
sults, through newspaper columns, it is necessary that
the medium of that advertising must get into the homes
of consumers. The number of such consumers deter
mines the value of the space and, consequently the value
to the people who purchase that space.
With the completion of the largest circulation cam
paign ever staged in Southern Arizona the Review is
prepared to offer, with no retractions and no qualifica
tions, the best medium for every kind of advertising. It
is now recognized in the Warren District and in Southern
Arizona as the leading publication of its kind and with
the large increase in its circulation fiis value will be
greatly enhanced.
The increase in costs to the newspapers of the coun
try, resulting from the rise in every sort of commodity
used in the newspaper business, has made itself felt in
Bisbee. The margin of profit has decreased and should
the Review decide to ask more for a better value it will
be based, not upon a hypothesis, but upon an actual
ability to give value received.
LETS DEAL IN FACTS.
Like the Warren District the Bisbee Review has little
actual interest in the county seat removal1 fight which is
being waged at the present time. This community ap
pears to be the bone of contention between Douglas and
Tombstone and the two contestants are pulling several
strings in their efforts to align support here. What tha
people of the Warren District desire are the facts, hav
ing to do with the present status of the county seat CM
those with which it would be confronted if the county
seat should be moved.
So far the campaign has been devoted to little other
than assertions and denials. Some orator or solicitor
from Douglas will make a Statement and the Prospector
will rise in its wrath and print an editorial denouncing
Major Kelly and others in Douglas for its origin. It
might be remarked that the fight, like the gubernatorial
contest, has rather got on the nerves of many of our
people who would appreciate a rest from politics.
If the people of Cochise county went to vote upon the
subject of county seat removal, we can see nothing re
prehensive in letting them do so. Of course Tombstone
objects. If that town did not she would not be entitled
to consideration. But why all -the row? Why make
mountains out of molehills and disturb the equanimity of
the people of the Warren District. Surely, if anyone
in Bisbee desires to vote upon the question, he or ah
should not be visited with the direst of criticisms from
Tombstone.
Elections are very popular in Arizona. If it is not a
regular election, many of our people get restless and
think it is "too long between drinks" and demand some
r-pi-rial affair. It is the prize indoor sport in the etate
and, though very expensive to the people who pay the
bills, progress is progress ajid Douglas is determined.
So go to it, Good People; but let us have sonic hard cold
facts and forget vain whimperings and would-be reprisals.
PRECINCT NO. 1.
The word received here Saturday evening announcing
that Judge Standiford, before whom the gubernatorial
contest is being heard, had thrown out all the votes cast
iu Precinct No. 1, Douglas, irgHted little surprise in this
city and few regrets, says The Douglas Daily Interna
tional. The disclosures regarding the mauner in whk-u
the election was carried on in the first ward in thus
city were surprising to the masses n this city aud one
of the surprises was the testimony of Art Pearson who
swore that he was designated by the democratic com
mittee to organize the election board at the city hull.
It is to be regretted that Mr. Pearson did not name the
committee who h;nl dollied him wit.'i all authority iu
Prw-inet No. 1 in the face of the fart that election Hirers
l ad been uatucd in that prcciurt by the board of super
visors to hold the election.
The irreruljirilies in I'r'(. i'l' No. 1 "ere ll'trni'i'..
Non-residents served on the election board, men not even
entitled to lawfully vote there, much less conduct the
election; the evidence showed that liquor flowed freely;
election officers were betting on the results of their own
count. Voters were accompanied to the voting booths in
violation of law.
Without regard to what result the elimination of Doug
las Precinct No. 1 has on the pending election contest
there should be no one to criticize the righteous judgment
of Judge Standiford who sat with much patience and
heard the recital of what happened in the contested
Douglas precinct.
During the trial resulting from the election contest
filed by ex-Governor Hunt there has been no headway
made in the work of harmonizing the democratic party
In the state. Instead of progress towards harmony the
Hunt machine has shown a disposition to widen the
breach and to read from the democratic party in Ari
zona every man who is under suspicion of voting against
Hunt last fall. If the future of the democratic party must
depend alone on those who voted for Hunt in the Novem
ber election then indeed would "the republicans capture,
the state at the lection in 1918. If the Huntites lay down
the guage of battle by the test that only these who voted
for Hunt are to have voice or privilege in the councils or
ranks of the Arizona democracy then the outlook is ex
cellent for more offices going to the republicans next year
than the governorship.
The attempt of the Hunt machine to discredit and
malign Bruce Stephenson, deputy county attorney in this
county, for no other reason than because he was honest
enough to admit that he voted against Hunt is sufficient
to discourage, those who would desire to have a reunited
democratic party in Arizona, one which could stand
against the assaults of political satan as they once did,
before a one man clique and ring undertook to use the
party for selfish purposes and in the interest of special
classes instead of in the interest of every class. ,

FIRES AND THE COST OF LIVING.
Few people realize how directly the much discussed
"High Cost of Living" is influenced by America's exces
sive fire waste. A recent nation-wide analysis of fires
and fire causes has shown enormous destruction of com
mon staples. Single fires in elevators and mills fre
quently consume the equvalent of a living for a small
army of people. For instance a recent blaze in an Illinois
elevator rendered 700,000 bushels of corn unfit for human
food, and also destroyed 300,000 bushels of oats.
Grain elevators, flour, cereals, grist and feed mills pre
sent well known elements of fire hazard in that they
are subject to explosions of the highly explosive dust mat
results from handling or milling grain. These disasters
also most many lives; a dust explosion in a Buffalo niillk
in 1913, resulted in over thirty fatalities. A short time
ago the United States Department of Agriculture made
a study of the frequent explosions in grain separators in
:he Bis Bend country of the Northwest, and found that
in the height of the season these reached from six to
ten a day, the flame from such explosions in a large
number of cases spreading into the surrounding grain
with destructive results.
individual barn fires add enormously to this total
Throughout most of the country (he season of thunCer
storms follows closely upon that of harvest, and thou
sands of bams, stored with potential food, go up in
names each year because of lightning. These fires must
be classed as largely preventable, since statistics com
piled by the Acturial Bureau of the National Board of
Fire Underwriters show that of the total fire loss from
lightning, more than 92 per cent, is found where light
ning rods are not used.
The spontaneous combustion of hay and grain in poorly
ventilated barns is another big factor which might largely
e prevented by proper precautions.
When to such items are added the fires in grain fields
from locomotive sparks, and from the matches of care
less smokers, it may be realized that a vast amount of
foodstuff is turned into clouds of smoke, instead of hu
man bone and muscle. This inevitably has its effect up
on the price of the remainder.
Most people depend upon groceries for their food, and
:iie average grocery, containing, as it does, stocks of
..erosene and other inflamable merchandise and other
inflamable merchandise, Is a special instance of fire haz
ard. This is shown by the great number that are con
sumed -during each year, and each grocery fire contracts
a definite quantity of staples from the national supply.
Meat supplies are directly affected by the large number
of live stock burned in fires in barns and stables, and also
y the many fires in packing houses, slaughter houses,
etc.
The same coudition holds true with other staples than
those of food. In two years there were reported 822 fires
in wool and cotton mills. Cotton Is a commodity which
is particularly subject to disastrous tttires. This also
applies in a marked degree to the refining, storing aud
handling of oil one of our commonest daily require
ments. Back of all of this loom the larger aspects of the situa
tion. With an average of more than one reported fire
lor every minute ofthe year, and a daily destruction ap
proximating $600,000, the United States is subjected to
an economic drain that affects every detail of its business
aud social life, and is a Urge, though unrecognized fac
tor, iu the cost of all commodities. Furthermore, it can
not be overlooked that a vast number of people are in
terested iu employment, and hence in earning power,
from the same cause.
If America were to reduce her fire losses to the frac
tional figures of most other countries it can hardly be
doubted that the cost of living would be materially lowor
ed. It must never be forgotten that 21.4 per cent of this
auuual bouliro is due to strictly preventable causes, UT.'J

Simons is expected to live.
Simons was arrested in the Warner
Hotel yesterday mornhig by Ouicer U
: K. Rice atter having administered a
beating to a man named Smith. Simons
told Judge Frank Thomas that he hau
learned mat Smith had planned Co
taKe Mrs. Simons to Naco yesterday,
and that he, simuns, had attacked
.Smith in a lit of aner. Sniiitt and
fMrs. Simons were summoned and,
'alter diiiiculties bad presumably been
! settled between them, the court re
leased them and Officer Rice agreed
to drop, the charge against Simons.
Mrs. Simons secured a revolver yes
terday and shot herself in the chest.
A pliysician was summoned and, find
ing the wound not serious, dressed it
and left Mrs. Simons in the care tt
her husband. While Simons' back
was turned his wife grabbed a tiny
leather case filled with some kind of
poison, in powder form, and swollowed
it. Another physician was summoned
when this was discovered and the wo
man's husband and several women liv

dotes which are believed to have coun
teracted the danger f the poison.
Before shooting her self, the woman
wrotet two notes, one reading: "My
husband is innoeent I killed myself,"
and the other requesting that all hot
money aud belongings be given to her

purchased the poison in Boston, but
did not know what, kind it was.

GRANDMOTHER'S BOTANIC
MEDICINE.
In every pioneer home the botanic
recipes of our grandmothers for the
treatment of disease were wonderfully
dependable. Every fall she gathered
her various herbs: thorougbwort. cam
omile, sage, pennyroyal, wormwood,
rue, etc. It is interesting to note that
Lydia E. Pinkham's Vegetable Com-
pound, the most successful remedy for
female ills we have, was originally
prepared for home use from one of
these botanic recipes, and the demand
for this famous medicine has grown
until over 350.000 pounds of roots and
herbs are used annually in its prepar
ation. It will well repay any woman
who suffers from female ills to give
this famous medicine a trial.
