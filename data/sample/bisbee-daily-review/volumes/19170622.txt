know their Dickens that Provis is the
escaped convict whose gratitude to

boy his beneficiary and to educate him.
The portrayal of this desperate char

is one of the most exacting perform

(By Review Leised Wire.)
WASHINGTON, June 21. The sen
ate finance committee late today took
what the members expect to be final
action on publishers' taxes in the war
revenue bilil, adopting by a vote of 8
to 6 an increase of one quarter of a
cent a pound on second class postage
rates, and an additional levy of 5 per
cent upon publishers' net profits over
$40,000.
Revenues of $3,000,000 only from the
increase in postage rates to 1 1-4 cents
a pound, which most publishers have
vigorously opposed, and about $9,000,
000 from the pilifits' tax are expected.
The committee's decision came after
days of dispute. The increase in post
age rates would apply to publishers of
newspapers, magazines and all other
periodicals, including religious publi
cations. The committee also decided to re
tain the house increase of 5 per cent
on letter rates, but tentatively agreed
to strike out the doubled postcard
rates. As about 1,000.000,000 postcards
were sent last year, if the postcard in
crease is eliminated $20,000,000 in rev
enues would be lost. The letter in
crease Is expected to raise about $50,-000.000.
In revising the extra profits tax to
day, deferring decision regarding the
rate of taxation, the committee decid
ed to extend its operations to individ
uals in trade as well as corporations
and partnerships. From individuals,
at the house rate of 16 per cent, it is
estimated $100,000,000 additional rev-
CANTONMENT MAY BE
LOST ON ACCOUNT
OF DIFFERENCES
Arizona Stands Chance To
Lose Cantonment Because
Her Senators And Delegate
Cannot Agree Upon a Site.
Lack of concerted action is given
in semi-official advices received by
Governor Thbmas E. Campbell from
Washington for Arizona's failure thus
far to receive a cantonment.
Governor Campbell Wednesday aft
ernoon wired both Arizona senators,
Henry Ashurst and Mark A. Smith,
and Representative Carl Hayden. say
ing that Arizona will be much disap
pointed if no cantonment is secured.
He urges them to put forth every ef
iVrt toward securing such a canton
ment It was seml-officially reported to
the governor also that the cantonment
site board that recently visited Ari
zona has recommended two sites in
Arizona. The first' choice is Tucson
and the secVmd is Douglas. People of
the central part of the state favored
Phoenix and people in the northern
part of the state favored Prescott. In
these semi-official advices Governor
Campbell was told the best way to
proceed was for Arizona representa
tives to make up their minds as to the
best probable locati'on for a canton
ment and then to present that as Ari
zona's choice.
Following is we wire sent by the
governor to Arizona senators and
Representative' Hayden:
"Arizona will be much disappointed
if no cantonment selection is made in
the state. We have unequalled cli
matic and strategic surroundings in
connection with the several sites Of
fered the site board. Unexampled
forage and foodstuff crops will tend to
make prices reasonable. I believe Ari
zona cantonment could be managed as
economically as elsewhere and the ef
ficiency derived from the better con
dition of the men is not to be disre
garded. Please use your most diligent
efforts In behalf of selection for Ari
zona. Wire how we can serve further
to bring this about''

ty of the people are represented by
strong leaders in the new government

Firmly convinced that unity of power
is essential and casting aside class
and special interests all social and po
litical elements have Joined in the na
tional program which the new gov
ernment proclaimed and which it is
striving to fulfill.
No Annexations.
"This program follows:
" 'The provisional government, re
rejecting in accord with the whole
people of Russia, all thought of sep
arate peace, puts it openly as its de
liberate purpose the promptest
achievement of universal peace; such
peace to presume no dominion over
other nations, no desire of their na
tional property nor any forced usur
pation of foreign territory; peace with
no annexations or contributions, based
upon the free determination by each
nation of its destinies.
" 'Being fully convinced that the es
tablishment of democratic principles
in its internal and external policy has
created a new factor in the striving of
allied democracies for durable peace
and fraternity of all nations the pro
visional government will take prepar
atory steps for an agreement with the
the allies founded on- its declaration
of March 27th. The provisional gov
ernment is conscientious that the de
feat of Russia and her allies would
be a great source of great misery and
would not only postpone peace but
would even make impossible the estab
lishment of universal peace on a firm
basis.
Victory Must Come.
"The provisional government is con
vinced that the revolutionary army of
Russia woll not allow the German
troops to destroy our allies on the
western front and then fall upon us
with the whole might of their weap
ons. The chief aim of the provisional
government will be to fortify the
democratic foundations of the army
and organize and consolidate the
arny's fighting power for its defensive
as well as offensive purposes.'.
"The last decision of the Russian
congress of the workmens' and sol
diers' delegates, the decision of the
all-Russian peasant congress, the de
cision of the Duma, the voice of the
country as expressed from day to day
by almost the entire Russian press, in
resolutions adopted at different con
ferences and congresses all these
confirm thir full support to this na-j
tional program and leave nut the
slightest doubt that Russia is decided
to fight the German, autocracy under
these conditions for a stable peace.
"Such decision Is becoming more
and more evident each day and shows
itself in the rapid re-organization of
the army which is being fulfilled un
der the firm and efficient measures
adopted by Minister Kerensky.
"To Make World Safe."
"The Russian people thoroughly un
derstand and are fully convinced that
it is absolutely necessary to root out
the autocratic principles which under
lie and are represented by German
militarism and which threaten the
peace, the freedom and the happiness
of the world. The Russian people feel
most keenly that no stable peace can
re secured until the German autocratic
principles are destroyed and that
otherwise the revolution will have
been in vain and its achievements will
perish.
"New Russia, in full accord with the
motives which Impelled the United
States to enter the war. Is striving to
destroy tyranny, to establish peace or. I
a secure and permanent foundation
and to make the world safe for demoo

CHICAGO GRAINS.
CHICAGO. June 21. Excellent crop
progress tended to pull down wheat
prices today, but shorts in the option
made use of the chance to even up
trades. The result was an irregular
market, with the close unsettled M
net lower to 1 advance of 2 cents, at
2-3 for July and 17S for September.
Corn gained ''i to IV, and oats '4 to
a4. In provisions the result ranged
from 5 decline to a raise of 40 cents.
Reports both from the winter belt
and from the spring crop region told
of encouraging farm conditions. For
eigners were said to be the chief sel
lers of the September delivery. Bears
laid particular stress on Washington
advances relating to organized labor
protests against high prices. Much at
tention was given to nn estimate by a
leading authority that the 1917 domes
tic yield of winter wheat would ag
gregate 467,000,000 bushels instead of
373,000.000 bushels, the total suggest
ed by the government's figures for
June.
Export demand from the entente
and from the Dutch government put
strength into corn.
Seaboard purchases had a bullish in
fluence on the cats market. Provisions
averaged higher owing in the main to
support from packing interests.

HELP THE RED CROSS.
' Teams representing the Bisbee chapter of the
American Red Cross are making a drive this week
to raise $25,000 for this branch of the society. That
the members will be successful seems assured from
the early returns of the work. That they should be
successful goes without saying. Every man and
woman in the Warren District should help.
, Unfortunately there are is Bisbee people who are
, . either selfish In the extreme or wbose leanings pro
scribe their helping the Red Cross: It is too bad that
,j some kind of conscription is not available to apply
' I in .such cases. The teams working for the success
"of taie local rive have been disillusionized In a num
ber of cases. It is gratifying, however, to state that
the number of -people who give with regret, or not at
all, are few and far between.
Men and women who are not liable to the draft,
forget that their brothers, their sons, their friends
and their relatives, may soon be giving of their life's
blood to a cause which this country has espoused.
The smallest thing they can do is to aid an organiza
tion, international in its scope, which will alleviate
physical and mental pain of our soldiers, of our civil
ians, of our allies' soldiers and their sorely pressed
people.
"It is more blessed to give than to receive," Acts
XX, 35, is most certainly true in the present instance.
What man or woman, after be or she has given to
the Red Cross (sometimes even when he or she may
have inconvenienced himself or herself) but does not
feel glad. After giving to a noble cause, what man
or woman does not feel thankful of his or her ability '
to do so?
The record of the Red Cross, in this and other wars,
is without equal. Surely, at the time of our entry Into
the melee of nations and when our manhood is being
sent in to stem the tide of autocracy, those people
who do not have to go, should lend a hand to those
who will bear our arms in the front trenches. It is
little enough, God knows, for, after all, life is the
dearest thing we possess.
Bisbee has a few more days to fill its quota. Those
who feel estranged from the country of their birth
or adoption, who feel that they owe their neighbor,
nothing, should be brought to the light and made to
see ,that is the work of the Red Cross there -is the
salavation preached and taugh by the Father of mod-
'erri Civilization.
We believe with Cowper. who in his "The Task."
"writes:
. "Give what thou canst, without thee we are poor,
"And with thee rich, take what thou wilt away."
MANY ARE OPPOSED.
In spite of what may be said on both sides of the ques
tion of 'county seat removal' it seems a tact that the peo
ple of the Warren District are at least quiescent on the
whole affair. Many there are in this community who be
lieve with Tombstone that no place in the Warren Dis
trict can obtain the court house, even should it be voted
away from the present county seat. Therefore, many are
asking that their names be taken off the petitions, cir
culated some time ago.
The Tombstone Prospector, which is fighting hard in
behalf of the famous old town and its interests, under
the heading 'Warren District Sees The Light," prints
the following editorial:
"The Warren District is just beginning to reallfce what
a mistake it made In siglnng the Douglas petitions for
an election on county seat removal. Many people with
good intentions thought that when they signed those peti
tions that Warren would go on the ballot; others thought
Bisbee proper, but no matter what they thought as to
the individual location, they all thought that some place
In the Warren District' would be on the ballot. But now
and for some time since the attorneys who have given
the matter any study have told and are telling the people
of the Warren District that they' made a mistake in sign
ing the petitions because Warren cannot go on the ballot,
not. being; Incorporated, and if the election is called on
the present petition now before the Board of Supervisors
for action on July second that there will probably be but
two towns on the ballot. Douglas and Tombstone. This
has come like a thunderbolt from a clear sky to the sign
ers of the petition for removal and they are wonderluj
how they can rectify their error which was that most of
the signers in good faith believed that Warren would
be on the ballot
"In a few days the people of the Warren District will
have a chance to correct the error. .
"And right now Tombstone wants the people of the
Warren District to know that if the time ever comes
that the people of this county want to move the county
seat and the Warren District agrees o nthe location any
where in its district that Tombstone, Fairbank, Curtis,
St David, Benson, Robinson, Dragoon, Johnson, Pool,
Buena, Garces, Jlereford, Naco, West Huachuca and
Gleeson will be with them to a man. This The Prospector
knows by a complete canvass of these precincts."
Douglas may have fooled the Warren District That
question remains to be settled by the courts. In any
t
event Tombstone's good wishes toward Bisbee have never
been doubted and the people of this community appear
to look with favor upon the plea of the present county!
seat and contain themselves with the effort to secure
good roads they will eliminate the necessity of constant
argument and politics for the transfer of the county
offices.
WHO ARE THEY FOOLING?
Germany, through its censored press, appears to enjoy
fooling itself and the people of the Central Powers.
Surely its pleas for "liberty," "equality," "liberalism."
etc., etc., find barren ground outside the autocracies in
which they find light and fool no one but the people
whom they are using to push their Kaiserism to its
senith.
The recent abdication of Constantine, of Greece, was
the occasion for many editorial explosions in Germany.
Tino," as the Greek King was called, seems to have an
affectionate place in the hearts of the Kaiser and his
court He should have. For has he not buckled to the
will and the hand of the German Emperor for these sev
eral years and predicated the future of his kingdom and
his people upon the dream of a great man Wilhelm?
German newspapers are practically agreed that the
abdication of Constantine is a victory for the Entente.
"The Allies hava won their first victory," says the
Tageblatt'
"The Vos8ische'8 financial expert writes:
"The Entente has a victory to book at last It is the
first in three years. The battle of Athens has ended for
the present with a victory for the 'glorious arms' of the
English, French; Italian and perhaps also their Russian
allies. Although the victory was bloodless, because it
was won by means of intrigue, blockade and other viola
Uons of law, after nearly three years of effort, it is none
the less noteworthy."
The German press, generally, is high in its praise of
Constantine. Note what the Vessische says about "Tino'
and about the "true liberty of nations":
"Whatever happens, we Germans will never forget with
what high moral courage Constantine and the Greek na
tion defended themselves against lending armed help
to the Allies.
"Even, if now, in the last stages of the world war,
Greek battalions should be hurled against our front we
shall bear in mind that these new opponents are not en
emies, but that their hearts beat for us and for the cause
of the true liberty of nations for which we are fighting.
Can the civilized world believe with Germany's press
when 'it raises its mellihious voice and says: 'their
hearts beat for us and for the cause of the true liberty
of nations for which we are fighting." They are but again
fooling themselves.
To Constantine the world should offer a prayer of
grief. Many correspondents have given him the credit
of being sincere. But many are believed sincere when in
reality external circumstances contributed to the particu
lar state of mind.
Never in recent history can a prince or a monarch re
peat Cardinal Wolsey's immortal words, in Shakespeare's
Henry VIII, with such feeling as can Constantine:
"Farewell, a long farewell, to all my greatness!
"This is the state of man; today he puts forth
"The tender leaves of hope; tomorrow blossoms,
"And bears his blushing honors, thick upon him;
"The third day comes a frost, a killing frost;
"And when he thinks, good easy man, full surely.
"His greatness is a ripening nips -his root,
"And then he falls, as I do. I have ventured,
"Like little wanton boys that swim on bladders.
"This many summers in a sea of glory;
"But far beyond my depth: my highblown pride
"At length broke under me; and now has left me,
"Weary and old with service, to the mercy
"Of a rude stream, that must forever hide me.
"Vain pomp and glory of this world, I hate ye;
"I feel my heart new open'd. O. how wretched
"Is that poor man that hangs on princes' favors,
"There is betwixt that smile we would aspire to,
"That sweet aspect of princes, and their ruin,
"More pangs and fears than wars of women have;
"And when he falls, he falls like LIcifer.
"Never to hope again."
And so with Constantine and his darling Wilhelm on
whose smile he hung and who sacrified himself and his
people for a favor, only to be lost, "Never to hope again."

RECONSTRUCTION IN

Food Administrator Herbert
C Hoover Tells Delegates
of The Needs of The French
People For Our Aid And
Comfort.
Reconstruction in France will be
one of the greatest works of the
American Red Cross, in the opinion o
Herbert C. Hoover. The American
Food Administrator, some days ago.
outlined his subject in the following
manner:
For nearly three years we had as
one of our duties the care of the civil
ian population in northern France.
We are, I think, the only Americans
who have been in intimate contact or
even In any contact with that impris
oned population. I think we are the
only group who know of their suffer
ing, of their misery, of their destruc
tion, and who know of what confronts
. 1 " AT-
France Needs More Than a Billion j
Dollars.
I made a rough estimate of the im
mediate amount of money required to
rehabilitate that little parcel of pop-
ulation. To support (hem for one year
to provide them with their implements,
to give them the roughest kind of
bousing, to get them back to the point
where they may get the land into cul
tivation and get . Into self-support, '
would run somewhere from seven to
ten millions of dollars. Altogether the
north of France is probably faced with
a total expenditure for rehabilitation '
which will run a billion and a half of
dollars.
Tuberculosis Has Spread Alarmingly.!
There are other problems in France
also demanding immediate help. Tu-j
berculosis from exposure in the
trenches, from a population in many 1
sections partially undernourished, has
spread to the most alarming degree.
The French, busy and intent upon the ;
war, with limited resources have per-j
haps neglected the problem, but theyj
need help, they-need, sanitary-support, j
ana iney neea care ana airecuon. i
am informed that there has been an
increase above normal in France, of
men alone, of more than six hundred
thousand tubercular cases.

terday were notified not to sell any

sue contained liquor advertisements,
which is against the new ! of the
state of Arizona. This is one of the
new laws that went iiu'j effect on June

book, paper or magazine that contains

RECEIVE THANKS.
The Bisbee citizens who donated
their services as registrars on Regis
tration Day have received a letter of
thanks from Governor Tom Campbell
for the same. The letter in part reads
as follows: "I am pleased to extend
my niOst sincere gratitude for the able
service you volunteered, that Arizona
should not be outdone by any state of
the Union on Registration Day. I am
proud of Arizona and the people who
have made such a patriotic showing
possible. They have given their heads,
hearts and hands to the great task Of
forwarding our country's cause In the
interest of humanity
RED CROSS WARNING.
The chain letter writer has turned
his attention to the Red Cross. Copies
circulating in Bisbee recite the need
of chloroform in Red Cross hospitals
and ask those receiving the letters to
each send 24 cents for this purpose to
a New York address, placing a key
number on each letter. This may be
a legitimate enterprise, honestly con
ceived, or it may be a straight graft or
a boost for the chloroform industry.
Whatever it is, the local Red Cross
has no knowledge of it and makes the
suggestion that whoever has an im
pulse to contribute at this time should
make his donat.On direct to his near
est Red Cross society. Chloroform
may be needed but no more so than a
hundred other things and if properly
financed the society can buy whatever
it needs. Even if the enterprise be
legitimate, .24-cent contributions will
never finance the Red Cross and will
lead a' great many to feel that they
have done all that is required of them.
When money is given to the Red CrOss
society direct, you know where it goes
to.
RECONSTRUCTION IN
FRANCE IS WORK FOR
AMERICAN RED CROSS
I i .
(Continued from Page Four.)
finitely greater objectives, and there
is" no support that can be given to the
merican ideal, to the American ob
jective of this war, better and greater
than a proper organization of that
;ide of our civilization which we be
lieve is today Imperilled. We are fight
ing against an enemy who had be
come dominated with a philosophy,
ith an idea for which there is no
room in this world with us. It Is a
atio nobsessed with the single Idea
that survival of the strong warrants
my action, demands any submergence
of the individual to the state, which
justifies their mastery of the world.
Our contention of civilization lies
the empering of the struggle for ex
istence by the care of the helpless.
The survival of the strong, the devel-
nment of the individual, must be
tempered, or else we return two thous
and years in our civilization. While
the Red Cross devotes Itself to the
strengthening of the strong, to the
support of the soldier. It is a duty of
the Red Cross illume that part of
American character and American
ideal which stands for the care of the
helpless.
I had hoped, and I think that all of
your officials had hoped that it would
be possible to now congregate the
strength of the whole nation into the
Red Cross, in order that it might un
dertake this, possibly the gretest,
work which we have yet to perform,
and that is to bind the wounds ,of
France!
