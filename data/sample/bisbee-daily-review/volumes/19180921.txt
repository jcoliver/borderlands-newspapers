THE ASSOCIATED PRESS. The
Holy Land is aflame under the im
tv stroke bv the
British, French and friendly Arab L
forces, and the Turks from the J
Jordan river eastward to the Medi- '
terranean seemingly arei n rout.
Added to their already heavy losses
in ground, men killed, wounded or
made prisoners and stores captured
in Belgium, France, Italy and the Bal
kans, the Teutonic allies, judging from
first reports ot the hostiliities begun
against the Ottoman in Palestine are
in for further extremely hard usage.
In less than a day General Allenby's
British forces, aided by French troops
and natives under the flag of the king
of the Hedjas struck the Turkish line
over a front of sixteen miles and pene
trated it to a depth of twelve miles,
taking more than 3000 Turks prisoner
and overrunning the entire hostile de
fensive system. Railway and highway
Junction points were captured and
strong forces of cavalry at last ac
counts were well in advance of the
attacking troops, threatening to car
ry out a turning movement : against
i the fleeing Turks which might prove
' disastrous to them. Meanwhile along
the shores of the Mediterranean naval
units were clearing the coastal roads
of the enemy by their gun fire.
In addition to the large number 01
prisoners taken great quantities of
war materials had fallen into the
hands of the allied troops, and the
pressure against the enemy was going
on unabated.
The predicament of the Turks is
heightened by the operations of the
Hedjas tribesmen on the east side of
the Jordan which will prevent them
from taking refuge across the stream
in the Jordan valley and compel them
to fight their way out of their' trou
ble west of the river as best they
may.
Although there has been somewhat
of a let up in the intensity of the
fighting from the region of St. Quen
tin to Cambrai in the French theater,
both the British and French armies
have been able materially to better
their positions in front of both Cam
brai and SL Quentin. Moeuvres, ly
ing to the west of Cambrai. over
which there has been such intensive
fighting for more than a week, in
which the town several times changed
hands, now is definitely British. The
large numbers of German dead strew
ing the ground around it attest the
value they placed on Mouevres as a
point of strategic importance in the
defense of Cambrai.
To the south on both sides of St.
Quentin the British and French have
moved in more closely the jaws of
the nipper which is being poised ulti
mately to pinch St. Quentin out of the
battle line. Most of the German strong
points which have been the means of
holding back the allied troops in this
region now have been overcome and
apparently it is only a matter of time
when General Foch will give the order
for the pressure of -the pincers and
the capture of St. Quentin.
In the region northeast of Soissons
the Germans still are using machine
guns in large numbers to bold back
the French from further encroach
ments on the Cherain Des Dames posi

counter attacks In endeavors to expel

Prevent Escape
LONDON, Sept. 20. (7:10 p. in.)
British forces in Palestine, under com
mand of General Allcnby, attacked the
Turkish positions on a front of 16
miles on September 1. The British
broke through the Turkish line8 be
tween Rafat and the sea and pushed
forward for a distance of 12 miles.
Three thousand Turks were tak'en
prisoner by General Allenby's forces.
The main Turkish forces in Pales
tine are now being closely pursued by
the British.
The cavalry pushed through the
Turkish front and was advancing in
the rear of the Turkish armies in
the direction of Nablus. Another body
of cavalry was advancing in a north
erly direction toward Elafula and
Belsan to intercept the Turks to the
north.
On Wednesday General Allenby's
right wing attacked west of the Jor
dan and occupied El Mugeir.
The text of the official communi
cation dealing with the operations in
Palestine, as issued by the war office
tonight follows:
"During the night of September 19
our troops commenced a general at
tack on the front between the Jor
dan and the sea. East of the Jeru

troops advanced successfully and in

attack In which French troops took
part, was launched after a sharp bom
bardment between Rafat and the
coast. Our infantry made rapid pro
gress, overrunning the entire hostile
defensive system on this frontage by
8 a: m. and penetrating to a maximum
depth of five miles before swinging
eastward.

soon be available.
All of the eleven balloons that the
aviator has destroyed within four days
were accounted tot cy means or in
, cendiary bullets. Lieutenant Luke car
ries special permission from his chief
to use such bullets for this purpose.
The majority of the attacks on the
balloons were made at the greatest
personal risk to the flier because he
was the objective of quantities of the

"flaming onions" which set an air

ENEMY REACTS VIOLENTLY
WITH THE FRENCH ARMY IN j
r kasl e., Sept. 20 (By the Associated
Press). The progress of General Man
gin's army toward the western ex
tremity ot the Chemln Des Dames has
driven the enemy to violent reactions.
Five vigorous counter attacks weri
made last night against th new
French positions east ot the Moisy
farm and north of Allemant. In every
one of these unsuccessful assaults the
Germans lost heavily.
The French troops have maintained
all gains made in this region and
have succeeded in organizing their
new operations.. Only - about three
quarters of a mile now separates the
French from the height on which
stands the ruins of Fort Malmaison.
It Is difficult ground adapted to the
kind of. defensive fighting tba Ger
mans carry on.
It Is the plateau of Chavignon- the
Germans defending here so desperate
ly. More than 430 of their dead were
picked up over a space a halt mile
long by a quarter of a mile deep, dur
ing the recent fighting. The posses
sion ot this plateau which is the key
to the positions north of the Chemln
Des Dames would compel the enemy
to abandon a part of the St. Gobaln
forest.

Fritz Fights; Fritz
Surrenders
Since July 1 8 the allies have taken some
two hundred thousand German prisoners.
This is a tremendous total, representing
more Germans taken during the past two
months on the western front than during
the entire preceeding four years of the war.
It is natural to ascribe as a cause for great
number of prisoners taken in every engage
ment lately the weakening of German re
sistance and the cracking of German mor
ale. In a measure this may be true. But on
the other hand, if certain German units sur
render more easily and quickly than they
have ever done since the beginning of the
war, it is also true that certain other Ger
man units fight as fiercely and as resolutely
as they have at any time since the kaiser de
clared war.
Consider the resistance Wednesday to
the British effort to take St. Quentin. Ev
ery foot of ground was earned by intense
struggle. The Germans counter attacked
i again and again in spite of appalling losses.
They seem to have elected to defend St.
Quentin to the end and the British, now'on
the edge of the Hindenburg line, will have
to fight hard to pass over -the intervening
mile or two of ground between them and
their goal. If Wednesday's resistance is
any criterion the Germans appear to pre
sent a'speckled army front to the allies at
their most vital sector. Before one village
a thousand men will surrender without
much of a fight and before another village
a thousand men will fight to the bitter
end.
Ten thousand prisoners as a bag for a
day's offensive on a twelve mile front that
only penetrated two and one-half miles of
fers a marked contrast to the fighting on
this same battle ground just two years ago.
Then at the end of a week's hard battling
the British would take from six to nine
hundred prisoners and call it a good haul.
But in the meantime it is confidently pre
dicted that the British bull dog will not let
go until he has the St. Quentin bone, and
along with the fall of this pillar of the Hin
denburg line the French are sure to add
La Fere. A major offensive by the Ameri
cans on the Lorraine front will certainly
begin in a day or two. The Germans are in
a very bad way. They are fighting against
time and the saving grace of winter. And
Foch is not the man to let them stop long
enough in the Hindenburg lines to get
breath and organize for a counter stroke.
Among the heroes of the Foreign Le
gion who landed in New York the other
day to help push the Fourth Liberty loan
was Captain de Gray. His record in the
Great War rivals the exploits of the most
famous warriors in all history. In one of
the battles of the Champagne in 1915, he
lost a leg from shell fire. Enough to keep
any man out of war for the rest of his life
even if he were Achille3 himself. But not
this gallant captain. He had an artificial
leg fastened td that shattered thigh and re
joined his regiment and has won fresh
f laurels in recent campaigns. Of course, in
the regular army it would have been im
possible for him to have entered the service
again. Red tape, rules and theory bar men
from the regular service for about a thou
sand reasons, many of them practical and
many of them silly. But the Foreign Legion
is an irregular unit of the. allied hosts. It
takes 'em all sizes, weights, colors, ages and
condition of the body and members. One
eye is enough for the Legion, if it is the
"trigger" eye. One leg is enough if the
cork substitute is hinged on properly. One
arm will do if it is the pistol arm. Hat feet,
discoloration of the skin, pimples, a missing
tooth, a fraction of a pound of weight miss
ing from the roll call or the fraction of an
inch in stature, these things keep many
thousands of splendid fighters off the regu
lar army rolls. But it's not that way in the
Foreign Legion. And yet in spite of its
foolish habit of accepting men that, accord
ing to the rules, are not fit for war, the little
old Legion has been cited eight times, for
gallantry and carries on its battle flags all
the decorations and medals that all the al
lied nations have at their disposal for hero
ism. Hail Captain de Gray! the du Gues
clin of his day and generation. Captain de
Gray of the one leg and the lion's heart and
the soul of flame !
Still the call from the gallant Czecho
Slavs is for more allied aid in their attempt
to save Russia from the Bolshevik traitors
within and the Germans from both within
and without In the light of the recent dis
closures that present absolute proof of Bol
shevik alliance with Berlin as paid emis
saries it is to be hoped that the United States
government will enlarge its policy of inter
vention. France and England and Japan
have for some time advocated a large force
of soldiers and unlimited aid to these patri
otic Russians in their splendid struggle
against odds, but our government has held
back, only agreeing to a small force of al
lied bayonets in stricken Russia. But the
situation is now momentous. Bolshevik
Red Guards and German prisoners and
regular troops are fighting together in the
kaiser's most cherished . cause. Czecho
Slavs opposing them are woefully short of
all equipment of modern war and have
been pressed back lately solely because of
lack of ammunition. Japan has a half
million troops available for a real drive
against the Lenin conspirators and the Ger
man ravishers. Delay at this time may well
result in consequences that will prolong the
Great War. Germany is desperately and
frantically striving to attain a position in
Russia that will enable her to procure men
and material and food for the campaign
next spring. The Bolsheviki leaders are
drenching Russian cities with blood in their
efforts to aid their employer at Berlin. The
allies have made a fine start in Russia. Will
they utilize Japan to save Russia or will
they hesitate for the third and it may well
be the fatal time in the east ?
ONLY FIVE C S. A. GENERALS LEFT
(From the Chattanooga Times.)
The death of Brig. Gen. William Mc
Comb, late of the Confederate Army at
Gordonville, Va., July 21, :1918," leaves
only five survivors of 464 general officers
commissioned lay the Confederate States of
America during the great civil conflict of
1861 to 1865.
These survivors are Maj. Gen. Evander
Mclver Law of Bartow, Fla.; Brig. Gen.
William Ruff in Cox of Richmond, Va. ;
Brig. Gen. Roger A. Pryor of New York;
Brig. Gen. Felix H. Robertson of Waco,
Tex., and Brig. Gen. Maurice J. Wright of
Washington.
Of the eight generals of full rank, and
of the nineteen lieutenant generals com
missioned by the Confederate government,
all are now dead; and of the seventy-eight
major generals, there is only one survivor;
and of the three hundred and fifty-nine
brigadier generals there are only four sur
vivors.
The headline writers and special corre
spondents and those who hastily summar
ize events give the impression to the casual
reader that the Americans are at the very
edge of the famous Briey iron fields of Lor
raine. That is our trouble. We become too
easily jubilant over preliminary successes
in this war. It has been the allied weak
ness from the start. And thus we are prone
to underestimate the magnitude of our
task. The fact is, the American troops are
twelve long, hard miles from the Briey
iron prize. The Germans are digging in,
the rain is falling on thi3 sector and some
time and a lot of fighting must intervene
before we redeem her great iron fields for
France.
State Chairman Stoneman has checked
it up to Colter. And so far, Colter and the
Hunt machine are standing pat. Law or no
law, Colter wants to keep on running for
governor. Party or no party. Colter's am
bition remains the same. A little thing like
a state constitution is no stumbling block to
a hard working politician.
This column delights to quote from the
speeches of that little giant, Lloyd-George.
Here if his latest: "Heaven grant that we
fight through to the end without negotia-tion.

DICK HIGHFIELD IS
CONVICTED OF
RAPE
FEELING WAS HIGH WHILE LIT
TLE GIRL OF ELEVEN RECITED
HER STORY PLEADS HIS OWN
CASE WAS PROUD THAT HE
SERVED PRISON TERM
INTERPRETERS ARE
KEPT BUSY WITH
LETTERS OF THANKS
In the superior court at Tombstone
yesterday Richard Stone Highfield
was convicted of the crime of statu
tory rape committed in this city on
the fifth of July. He will be sentenced
this morning by Judge McAlister, who
is in Florence. ,
The case was the first one called
yesterday morning and it took until
about 11 o'clock to secure the jury
The state was represented by County
Attorney John F. Ross and assistant
Maurice Blumenthal, and the defend
ant by S. W. White, of Douglas. There
wag considerable feeling expressed in
the court room while the little girl
was on the witness stand and told of
her sufferings and humiliations at the
hand3 of the defendant not only in
Bisbee but at Globe and other places.
There were a number of men in the
court room that expressed the opinion
that he should be lynched and that
they would be willing to help do it.
These expressions were expressed to
one another arid there was consider
able talk on the; streets during the
noon recess.
When court resumed its delibera
tions ' Sheriff Welch had taken the
precaution to have several additional
officers about the court room to pre
vent any demonstration Ihat might be
started.
The testimony of the little girl, cor
roborated by the statements made by
three 'men who were in adjoining
rooms in the Moose hotel at the time
of the offense and the facts testified
to by the doctors as the result of
their examination was sufficient to
convince the jury.
The defendant requested to be al
lowed to argue his own case to the
jury and he was allowed to do so. He
stated that he was an outlaw from Ar
and that it had been brought out that
he had already served a term in the
penitentiary at Florence for cattle
stealing and that he was proud of the
fact. He stated that he was only in
side of the walls for two days and that
he was then made a trusty and was
paroled by Governor Hunt and later
pardoned by him. He related his expe
riences in joining the army and that
he had been discharged. He also
statde that he was an outlaw from Ar
gentine Republic, that he had taken a
girl of 12 years of age away from
there as she was in debt to another
man and that was the custom there
to keep them in bondage and had tak
en her to San Francisco and that all
the time he was on the way out of
there with her until he landed in San
Francisco that he slept with her ev
ery night. He manifested his inno
cence and stated that if there was a
God above that he hoped that he
would be struck dead that minute if
he was guilty of the crime as charged
by the state. He intimated that it
was possible for the state to have
coaxed the little girl into saying what
she had on the witness stand as they
had been keeping her since to com
mission of the offense. In this con
nection the little girl told no differ
ent story on the witness stand than
she had told the next day after
Highfield had been arrested, to Coun
ty Attorney Ross and Probation Of
ficer Miss Esther Cunimings.
The jury was out about twenty-five
minutes when they brought in their
verdict. The crime of which he is
convicted is punishable by confine
ment in the state prison for life or for
any term of years not less than five.

GERMAN CASUALTIES HEAVY.
BRITISH HEADQUARTERS IS
FRANCE. Sept. 20. (Reuter's, via
Montreal.) German casualties in the
battle for St. Quentin, which now is
quieting down, have been most heavy
owing to the close character of the
fighting and the sturdy resistance of
the Teutons.
The Principal centers of the fighi
ing yesterday were around Epehy,
where an Alpine corps continued a
stout resistance and between Gouzeau
court and Villers-Guislain, where the
Sixth Brandenburg division was raked
to shreds by a machine gun barrage.
The villages of Holnon and Lempire
have been entirely cleared of small
pockets of Germans. North of St. Hel
ene the Australians pushed on. The
Germans were not disposed to come
to grips and only six were made pris
oners. In addition to the eighteen en
emy divisions engaged on Wednesday
between Gouzeacourt and the Somnie,
prisoners have been taken from at
least two further divisions of the re
serve. One of tl'c.-e divisions was

.a neutral country, but my heart and
my neighbors' hearts are with you."
wrote a widowed mother from a North
European country. "Hundreds cf oth
er letters contained similar expres
sions "My wife and I pray three times a
day for the United States and her
blessed armies," wrote a Rumanian
father.
Interspersed are hint3 of great pov
erty which the checks from Washing
ton help to ameliorate. A few letters
fontain inquiries or complaints that
the payments are not greater. Each
letter must be turned into English by
a corps of trained translators, hastily
gathered in recent weeks. Then the
inquiries pas3 through the hands of
aierks who may spend most of a day
wading through yards of files of sol
diers' names, addresses or army or
ganizations which inquiries failed to
give, or careless soldiers neglected to
record properly.
Finally the answers are written In
English, turned back into the original
language, and sent on their way to a
foreign land. Many carry a paragraph
of good wishes or encouragement
which make them not merely business
notes, but messages of good cheer
from America. The greater proportion
of the letters go to Italy and Greece;
Two score translators and stenog
raphers do this work, directed by Mrs.
M. Crenshaw, around whom the organ
ization grew up. The principal trans
lator is Dr. Aurelio Palmieri, Italian
scholar, master of a score of lang
uages and dialects, who has taught in
leading European universities, lived
among the eastern peoples of Europe
and studied their sociai problems. He
reclassified the theological library at
Harvard a few years ago, and more re
cently classified the Congressional
Library's Yudin collection of Siberian
literature.
Important as this foreign language
section is to the war risk insurance
bureau, it is one of the smallest di
visions. The entire bureau has ap
proximately 11,000 employes 10.000 of
whom are women. No other govern
ment bureau has so many civil em
ployes, and no other man in V'shing-
ton does so much hiaing as W. A. Mc
Kenzie, the chief clerk and immediate
boss of these 11.000. Yet Chief Clerk
McKenzie can not hire all the wo me.:
typists and stenographers he needs.
The exodus of several hundred school
teachers, employed during the sum
mer as clerks, leaves vacancies which
even the civil service commission has
difficulty in filling, though salaries
range usually from $1000 to $1200 a
year.
As American armies grow, so must
the bureau grow. AlEcady it handles
loO.OOO letters a week. Every Mon
day morning between 60.000 and 70.
000 letters, the accumulation of two
days, pour in. to he slit open, read,
sorted, and referred to the proper sec
tion, where information is gathered
for an answer.
The bureau has on file 3.500.H00 ap
plications for allotments and allow
ances, and nearly 5,5in,000 checks
have been sent out since last Decem
ber. Now they are going at the rate !
of a million a month. In addition, the !
bureau has taken care of 3,3h),000 ap-',
plications for government life lnsur-1
ance. Various sections of this big
government department are housed in ;
twelve buildings in Washington hav
ing 310,000 square feet of floor space.

I was so nervous that the least noise

DENIES REPORT
NEW YORK, Sept. 20. Dun's to
morrow will say:
While the special demands of the
period, far exceeding earlier calcula
tions and still enlarging in many in
stances, ,.ave not prevented some sea
sonal increase of strictly civilian busi
ness, less of it appears than usual and
none at all is observed in quarters
where such expansion would conflict
v. ith the pressing government require
ments. That tlie whole economic
stricture, from banking circles to
manufacturing and distribi'tini; cban
ne.s, is being brought more and more
closely under tbe domination of war
intlueuccs there is multiplying evi
dence, and no difficult condition is to
be expected while the world wide up
heaval continues. With warrant in
piist experience, however, confidence
in tbe 1 ut u re remains unshaken ana
the conviction is general that the fur
ther readjustments which are clearly
foreshadowed will be accomplished
with a minimum of unsettlement as
have been those already encountered.
Yet there is no disposition, either
among official or private interests to
disregard the fact that new and per
plexing problems are impending and
no other business question of the day
has greater significance or presents
more formidable difficulties than the
maintenance of a high rate of produc
tion of war materials.
