NEW YORK, Mar. 17. Secretary Lans sent word from the conference room at
2:20 o'clock that the brotherhood men had left but that the mediators were still in confer
ence with the managers. He said no further statement would be made tonight
NEW YORK, Mar. 1 7. Secretaries Lane and Wilson and Daniel Willard, three of
the mediators appointed by the national council of defense in an attempt to avert a general
raiload strike, were still in conference with the brotherhood chiefs and the railroad man
agers at 2:15 o'clock this morning.
Samuel Gompers, the fourth member of the council of national defense, armed as a
mediator, had not arrived and no word had been received from him, so far as could be
learned.
President Issues Appeal.
WASHINGTON, Mar. 16. President Wilson today called upon the railroad man
agers and chiefs of the employes' brotherhoods as patriotic men to re-open the questions
at issue between them and prevent a general interruption of railroad traffic "in this time of
national peril."
The President s message, an
appeal for readjustment of differ
ences and a solemn protest
against a strike, was sent after
lie and the cabinet had approved
a proposal of the council of nr
tional defense that it seid a com
mittee to New York to undertake
mediation between the railroads
and the employes. At the same
time three of the commission.
Secretaries Lane and Wilson, ant!
Daniel Willard, president of the
Baltimore & Ohio Railroad, start
ed for New York to seek immedi
ate conferences with representa
tives of both sides.
Gompers Absent
Samuel Gompers, president of
the American Federation of Lab
or, is the fourth member. Until
tonight it was understood at the
White House that he had gone to
New York with the committee,
tut it developed that be bad been
out of the city for two days and
that Secretary Lane, entrusted
with arrahgenients for the com
mittee's trip probably bad not
been able to reach him.. Officials
at the federation's headquarters
would not say where Mr. Gompers
was, but explained that be bad ;
been keeping in touch with the
brotherhood leaders from a point
near New York. It was thought
he would be In New York tomor
row if he did not get there to
night. The President is confident that
there will be no strike.
Already he is considering what may
be done if bis appeal is futile. Legal
officers of the government are study
ing the problem to determine what
measures will be lawful not only in
an effort to keep food supplies and
the mails moving, but to deal with an
even more serious situation If the
country should be drawn into war.
The latter phase is Wing given only
minor attention, however, as officials
are satisfied that if war came the loy
alty of all the railroad men could be
depended upon.

Far reaching reform in Russia are promised the people as a result of the revolution. A system
based on universal suffrage, abolition of all social or religious and national restrictions and amnesty for
all political and religious offenses are included in the program of the executive committee of the Duma
which constitutes the provisional government. The removal of social, religious and national restrictions
would give freedom to the Jews in Russia. Liberty of speech and of the press and universal suffrage in

The Coming Baby
Every he?p that will lend to aid
the expectant mother and foster the
wcll-bein; cf the t:i:y infant should
be promptly rendered.
The titie before childbirth is one
of much discomfort. This is caused
in a large measure by the tightening
and straining1 of the abdominal tis
sues, as well as the network of cords,
ligaments and muscles in that part
of the body.
For many years thousands of
women have successfully used the
preparation known as "Mother's
Friend." It is safe and dependable
to be used by every prospective
mother. A famous physician formu
lated the preparation. "Mother's
Friend" is for external use, and is
"composed of special oils and other in
gredients which have a penetrating
and softening effect. Relief from
much cf the pain at the crisis is
found,
Any woman awaiting1 childbirth
should secure a bottle of "Mother's
Friend" from her druggist, when the
abdomen first begins to expand. No
time should be lost in beginning its
ti'-e. Apply it night and morning J Sf n Francisco

inferred that the communication does
not. reflect on the suspicion of Ger
man influences behind the proposal
which has been general among offi
cials here and was accentuated by
revelation of the effort to align Mexi
co with Germany against the United
States.
In many tiuarters here the belief
prevails that a softening of General
Carranza's attitude toward this gov- .
eminent has followed the withdrawal
of the American troops and the ex
posure of German intrigue in Mexico.
Editorial comment in Mexican news
papers are pointed to also as showing
a better feeling toward the Lnited
States and the reception tendered
Ambassador Fletcher has been grati
fying to officials here.
Soon after it was received a month
ago General Carranza's proposal was
answered by the state department In
a note neither approving nor disap
proving the proposal. Officials have
not revealed whether any further com
mur.iration prompted today's reply.
Neither has it boon disclosed wheth
er General Carranza has replied to
the American innuiry for such further
information as Mexico might have re
garding Germany's machinations
against the I'nited States.

"The Wasted Years" Presenta
Mutual Star in Dual
Role.
Crane Wilbur, star in and author o
the Mutual Masterpiece, Do Luxe
Edition, "The Wasted Years," which
comes to the Eagle theatre today, is
one of the most popular screen stara
and Is a writer t)f no mean ability.
Mr. Wilbur was born in Athens. N
Y. A large part of his early life was
rpent in study.' He was especially
fond of history and the languages, and
even before he left school to go on the
stage he had mastered several lan
guages and had read far more litera
ture than most young men of his age. I
When Crane Wilbur was fifteen, he
had an opportunity to g'j on the stage j
with Sir Henry Irving in "Robes
piere." and shortly after, because of
his excellent work, he became a mem
ber of Mrs. Fiske's famous Manhattan
company, with whom he remained for
four years. It was through an un
foreseen turn of ' fate that he entered
4 the stock stage, which, he now de
clares, was the most valuable training
that he JLuld have desired for pictures.

our exercise in winter, eat too heav Ay, indulge our desires too much, and get
slow, lazy and half-efficient. Then, with tiie organs working badly, comes a chill, a cold

"When a man gets to be 72 years
old he is apt to have trouble with
his kidneys. Several years ago my
kidneys got out of order and the
muscles of my back became lame
and weak and hurt me every time I
bent. over. My kidneys became
weak and inactive. The kidney se
cretions were highly colored. I ft It
pretty mch run down when I be
gan taking Doan's Kidney Pills, but
two boxes fixed me up in good
shape. Since then I have used
Doan's off and on and they have
kept my kidneys well and my back
strong."
TANK HILL.
Amos Shreve, 19 Tank Hill, says:
"My kidneys weren't acting regu
larly and annoyed me very much.
There was a heavy, dull ache in
my back, over my kidneys, and it
seemed it would never let up. My
back was as sore as a boil. When
I bent over or tried to lift anything,
sharp pains would catch me. Doan's
Kidney Pi'.ls soon relieved the pains
in my back and alter I bad used
them awhile, I was cured of all the

No .More Shells for Europe.
Munition makers in this country are said to have been
notified by the British government that all contracts
for shells must be completed by the end of the present
month, and that no more contracts may be expected there
after. Great Britain, It is explained, has now arrived at a
point where she is able to supply all her own needs in
this respect, together with the needs of her allies. An
other important consideration is that the transportation
of munitions to Europe Is becoming increasingly difficult,
owing to the U-boat peril. It is easier and safer for the
British to make their own shells, rifles, ammunition, etc.
The demand for other war supplies, too, is falling off.
The announcement has attracted little attention, be
cause the situation is such that export munition order
are no longer important. The' cessation of the foreign
demand has already been discounted in this country.
Our manufacturers have foreseen the present develop
ment, and have been turning their facilities to the pro
duction of goods for the domestic trade. Tie home de
niand for all sorts of commodities is so great that fears
of loss during the transition period are not being realized.
And there is another fortunate aspect of the situation.
The slump in the foreign demand for war stuff, comes
just at a time when the United Stales finds it necessary
to provide itself with such 6upplie3 Thus our manu
facturers are able to produce quickly and easily nearly
all forms of war material needed by our government.
A group of young men of Beatrice, Neb., are reported
to be undertaking a co-operative farm organization with
the purpose of making them independent of the cost of
living.
They are calling their organization "Labor's Liberty
League" and expect to have it incorporated as soon as
their membership reaches the 500 mark. According to
te provision of their contracts, every member ia to
ie- osit in a lcral bank $2 a week for two years. When
the membership is complete and the fund has reached
COO ell paid in, the organization will begin its active
work and the proposition will begin to show results in
profits to members.
A farm of 640 acres or more is to be purchased and
worked in the most modern and effective way. Every
member of the club will receive produce from the farm.
If cows and hens are amenable to the plans of the
league, every member will receive 100 pounds of butter
and 50 dozen eggs a year from the farm. J
There Eeem to be all sorts of co-operative schemes for
reducing living expenses while maintaining standards.1
"Getting together" with a lot of his neighbors is one way
for the consumer to defend himself from artificial high
prices. There's just one drawback. Such co-operation
calls for leaders with initiative, perseverance and effi
ciency. Lack of the right kind of management has
aused more than one co-operative venture to fail.
I
Army Cooks.
"The only trouble with an army cook," complains a
British soldier, "is that he can't cook." It's the same in
the American army and the national guard. The accept
ed military idea seems to be that anybody can cook
that a man who wouldn't be trusted by his wife to fry
an egg or boil water for tea is perfectly fitted to prepare
food for a company of soldiers without culinary experi
ence or instruction.
Marksmen are not made that way. An army colonel
or a navy captain doesn't pick out a few of his men
casually, and inform them, "You're gunners." But sotne
such absurd process is followed in the commissary de
partment, in spite of the recognized fact that fightin;
men's stomachs are every bit as important as their guns.
There is a demand in the British army for women
cooks. But that would raise new and puzzling problems.
And anyhow, theft's no reason why men shouldn't be able
to cook as well as women they do it in restaurants, so
why not in armies?? All they need is training. Why
not train them?
Six-Cent Fish.
New York City has gone into the food business, and its
first achievement is impressive. By way of lowering the
price. of fish, ten tuns of smelts were imported from the
Pacific coast. They were sold at 6 cents a pound, giving
the retailers a profit of 1 1-2 cents a pound. The regular
dealers were asking three times that much for Atlauti-:
smelts. Naturally they commanded a ready sale. The
city promptly ordered 40 tons more, and it is expectoi
that tWre will be additional shipments of smelts au.l
otber varieties of fish from the western coast.
Several features of this experiment claim attention.
When fish can be shipped clear across the continent and
sold at a profit at a price ooe-third as high as the price
asked for the same fish from local -waters, something Ji
wrong with the eastern fish industry. It is noteworthy,
too, that those smelts came all the way from Tacoma
to New York in 120 hours. When the railroads can do
that in such a case, why can't they give just as prompt
transportation whenever there is a scarcity of any kinl
of food in any part of the country?
Another impressive fact and a fact that probably ac
counts for the success of the. New York undertaking U
the personnel of the New York food supply committee.
The chairman of that committee and the active head of
the movement, to ease the food situation is George W.
I'erkins, one of the ablest men in America.
If ( hud a few more captains of industry of Mr. rer
uns' caliber working ou the country's food problem,
we'd ret somewhere with it.
Regulating the Paper Industry.
The federal trade commission acting as a board of
arbitration has done an excellent piece of work in its
handling of the print paper problem. It has made public
the truth regarding the paper industry and has fixed a
price which most newspaper publishers and paper manu
facturers seem willing to accept as equitable.
The commission finds what publishers have maintained
all along that it would find:
"The increases in the selling price of news print paper
for the year 1916 in most cases were greater than could
be justified by the increases in cost. There is not now
and has not been a serious shortage of news print.''
Economy is advised, but "there' is enough news print
paper to meet all the strictly necessary demands of pub
lishers durtng 1917."
For paper bought by the carload the commission estab
lishes the price of $50 a ton. Before the ruinous advanco
of last year begin, the price for large orders generally ran
about $10 a ton. It was raised to $60 and $70, and even
$90 a ton. Small publications were hit much harder, hav
ing to pay as high as $150 to $1S0 a ton for their paper.
What this has meant to the newspaper business and the
eneral public is admirably stated by the commission:
"It is the smaller papers that will suffer most if pres
ent conditions continue. The small daily and weekly pub
lications of the country particularly serve a great and
useful purpose jn disseminating facts and in the creation
of an intelligent public opinion, and such disaster as im
pends by reason of this increase in the price of news
print papr makes the question one of public concern."
It is a matter for special congratulation, then, to tn
smaller communities that the newspapers which serve
vuh stoill lush, are in many instances not more than
half the rates paid in recent months.
The case against the paper manufacturers is clear and
"nvinclng. Tbey are declared to have suppressed com
petition and manipulated the market improperly through
"a trade association organized ostensibly for a lawful pur
pose." They afe accused of "discouraging the production
of news print, dividing customers, promoting fear Uiat
e supply would not be equal to the demand anc"
disseminating propaganda justifying higher prices be
cause of alleged higher costs, and in other ways." All
these activities are proved baseless and wrong. The
manufacturers are fortunate in escapiug prosecution.
They have acted wisely in compromising without a right,
nd acquiescing in the price fixing of the commission.
Electrical Gardening.,
British newspaper correspondent, writing for the
London Daily Express, rhapsodizes over a new agricul
tural development in Herefordshire, Eng. British agri
culture, he announces, is on the eve of a wonderful
transformation.
"The vagaries of the British climate will be conquered.
The yield will be doubled or even trebled. Within a few
years the country will be self-supporting."
This miracle is to be accomplished by bringing perpet
ual sunshine. An electrical engineer has been experi
menting along the line of stimulating vegetable growth
by electric light. Here is what the- veraciqus corres
pondent avers he heard and saw when the current was
switched on at the Huntington Court Farm:
'Trebcntly 1 heard a sound like the approach of au
army of grasshoppers. As the wiud rose, the sound sc
sembled the sizzling of bacon or tho crackling of thorns.
(As the intelligent reader will instantly perceive, it was
not really grasshoppers or bacon it was the vegetables'
growing paius). The strangest of all was that plants and
bushes could be seen moving upward and reaching to
ward the vivifying wires."
Similar experiments have been carried out in this
country, and it has been found that plants really do grow
more rapidly under the influence of electric light. Tho
process forces growth 21 hours a day, iusteail of letting
plants rest at night as most of them do if left to the'r
own devices. Never, however, have we heard of such
marvelous results as those attested by the British correspondent.
If foodstuffs can be made to grow so visibly and audi
bly, surely tliere is no limit to production, except post-i-My
tii'.- :itiiil of electric power. Where will the British ag
ricultural electricians pet current enough to provide the
liiMiry of electric illumination for all the food plants and
Ijusii..- in Great Britain?

decisively defeated at Or near Rosario,
sweeping campaign of that district

Fashion experts agree that green
will be the most popular color in
every part of the world today in hon
or of St. Patrick, whose name wast
made the seventeenth day of March i
a near-holiday wherever there are
Irish men and women. Patriotic sons
and daughters of Erin will appear iO
day wearing shamrock leaves, clay '
pipes, green neckties and any othqr of j
the many symbols' of St. Patrick's Day j
that they can pin on to their cloth-'
ins. The big patriotic Irish meeting ,
that was to have been held in the
city park, with Attorney Wiley E. j
Jones as orator of the day, has been 1
called off, on account Of the inability,'
of Mr. Jones to attend at this time.
St. Patrick's Day will not go by
totally unobserved, however, for the
ladies of St. Patrick's Church here i
will give a supper and dance tonight

EVIEW
NEW YORK, Mar. 16. The calm
ness amounting almost to indifference
with which Wall Street today accept
ed the strike order of the railroad
brotherhoods and the upheaval in the
Russian empire was regarded by im i
partial observers as strong proof ol j
the market's sold out condition and I
inherent strength. i
At no time was the market heavy
or weak, although it experienced fre-
quent periods of irregularity. Rails j
were sluggish for the greater part ol
the day but developed strength in tho J
final hour, Reading, New York Cen-
tral. Union Pacific gaining from one ;
to almost two points. I
United States Steel and kindred in
dustrials made variable but steady
progress toward higher prices, V. S.
Steel showing an extreme gain of 1$,
to Ill's. Lackawanna was somewhat
erratic but Virginia Coal and Iron
rose five points to 64.
Activity in coppers was restricted
to Utah and Kennecott although Am
erican Smelting was occasionally in
demand. Motors and accessories fig
ured to a fair degree in the activity
of the late session. General Motors
gaining 3T4 points at 123.

from 1 net lower to three cents ad

July at 1.54 to 1.55V. Corn gained
to 1H and oats to . In provis
ions the outcome varied from 7Vi de
cline to a rise of ten cents.
Developments iu the railroad con
troversy ruled wheat throughout the

Search for Pete Morro, Who
W?s Held Up Last Week,
Is Without Result; Trio Ac
cused by Him Dismissed.
Pete Weeder, A. J. MacMakin and
Marvin Griffith were released yester
day afternoon when their preliminary '
hearing on a charge of robbery was
called before Judge M. C. High. The !
case against them was dismissed on '
account of the non-appearance of Pete ;
Morro, the complaining witness. Mor
ro was held up and robbed one night
last week. He pointed out Wet-dor as
the man who committed the crime
and charged the other two men with
complicity. The next day Morro dis
appeared and the hearing of the three
men, which was to have been held
Monday afternoon, was postponed tin1
til yesterday. City and county officers
telegraphed all over the state in an j
effort to locate Morro, but the search
was unavailing. The officers are con
fident that Morro was driven out of
town by Erewery Gulch gangsters.
The search for Morro is still being '
c&nducted, officers fearing he may
have met with foul play.

LOS ANGELES, March 16. Police
were asked today to aid in the recov
ery of a pear! necklace valued at from
?4ii,000 to $100,000, which was reported
stolen from Mrs. Frank Sullivan.
Smith of New York. j
The necklace consists 'of 67 pearls, .
.-aid to be perfectly matched, given to
Mrs. Smith by her fattier. Smith is.
president of the SUawmut Mining com
pany and the Shawmut Coal and Coke
rompauy.
' The necklace was missed by Mrs.
Smith Wednesday upon her return to
the suburban hotel, where she and her
I husband have been staying, from after
noon tea in a downtown njtei.
At the night meeting the
Choir of sixty voices pang.
I Little girls dressed In fluffy white
I dresses, their heads Ornate with flow'
lng ribbons to represent the blood
Christ, small boys with white shirt
waists and ties to match their part
ner's bead dress, sat in the choir and
I sang with the spirit of God In their
hearts, their enthusiasm touching the
hearts of the older people in the
1 audience, many of whom recalled thr
days when they wore white pinafores
and attended church, not fi'om choice
as these youthful songsters were, but
because their parents made them.
Not only did the Junior choir sing
but as a variation, and a very pleasant
one it was, they whistled In perfect
I unison the chorus to several stirring
! hymns. Several of the boys and girls
t appeared in solos, duettes and quar
I tettes and despite the packed house,
experienced no stage fright and sang
' without a waver l their voice.
During the day 70 people signed
cards to begin the Christian life. ,
