In Reply, Acting Secretary of
State Phillips Warns That
Any Harm to Americans in
Russia Will Prove Reactive
WASHINGTON, July 1. The Rus
sian sovjet government was warned by
the United States today In a message
sent through the American legation at
Stockholm that reprisals against
American citizens In Russia would
arouse intense sentiment in the
United States against the soviet
heads. The warning was contained in
a cablegram sent by Acting Secretary
of State Phillips in reply to a protest
from" soviet foreign minister, Tehltchi
erin against the reported arrest of L.
A. C. K. Martens, the soviet represen
tative in New York. The protest in
tl piated that reprisals might be taken
against Americans in Russia.
Arrest Report Denied
Secretary Phillips in his reply as
serted that Martens had not been ar
rested, but said it was understood he
was claiming official status as "the
representative of a regime at Moscow
. which the United States has not rec
ognized." The reply also said Mar
tens was a German citizen and denied
that the American government con
templated any action against law
abiding Russians in the Tnttea mate.
The message sent by Foreign Min
ister Tchitcherin was made public by
the department as follows:
Soviet Govt. "Indignant"
"The commissariat for foreign af
fairs has learned with Indignation of
the arrest of Mr. Martens. Its repre
sentative in New York. The commis
eariat wishes to point out that all the
diplomatic and consular representa
tives of the American government in
Russia after the departure in Septem
ber last have been; treated by the
soviet authorities with : the utmost
courtesy. In spite of the fact that since
June of last year the American gov
ernment openly sided with all the
Russian and foreign dark forces
ranged against the workers and peas
ants of Russia with the sole object of
crushing- the great revolution and re
storing Tsardom and bureacratic capi
talistic rule.
"Even after American troop3 had
landed, on Russian territory and ac
tually partook in military operations
against the Russian laboring people,
not a Single American citizen had
been molested, Moreover, American
official and journalists have been al
lowed admittance into Russia and ac
corded every courtesy and all possible
facilities and privileges. The arrest
of Mr. Martens is the more surprising
and unjustified, as he acted openly as
the representative of soviet Russian
without calling forth any objection or
protestation on the part of the Ameri
can government. .

Law Arrests
KANSAS CITY, July 1.
Two bartenders were arrest
ed here late today on orders
of Francis M. Wilson, United
States attorney, charged
with selling beer. They were
arraigned before United
States Commissioner Harry
L. Arnold and entered pleas
of guilty. Bonds were fixed

believed to be the first of the
kind in United States, said
District Attorney Wilson.

he had received no word
from Attorney General Pal
mer, and was proceeding on
his own initiative under the
law which prohibits the sale
of "beer, wine or other in
toxicating malt or vinous
liquor."
Less than one-half of
Kansas City's saloons were
open today and practically
all that were open sold only
"near beer" or light wines,
it was said.
Notoe of the city breweries

75 HUHTWHEN
Navy Dirigible Explodes
It Is Preparing Flight,
Injuring Spectators
as
WASHINGTON, Juily 1. A na
val court of inquiry will be con
vened, it was announced at the
navy department tonight, to de
termine, if possible, the cause of
the explosion which wrecked the
huge naval dirgible C-8 at Camp
Holabird, near Baltimore', today.
Naval aviation officials ex
pressed the belief that the ex
plosion must have been the re
sult of the careless use of a
lighted match or cigarette or
cigar by a spectator who ap
proached too netar the big hydrogen-filled
bag.
BALTIMORE. July 1 The big navy
dirigible C-8, commanded by Lieut. N.
J. Learned, with a crew of six men
and two passengers bound from Cape
May, N. J., to Washington, exploded
with terrific force just after landing
at Camp Holabird, near this city an
iz:6j p. m. toaay to adjust rudder
trouble. The explosion shook the
cantonment and the eastern section of
the city like an earthquake. The great
balloon instantly became a mass of
flames. Shooting flames and bits of
blazing fragments scattered over a
crowd of nearly 200 persons who had
gathered to isee the monster flyer and
many were blown partly across the
field. Seventy-five persons, mostly
women and children, were burned or
otherwise injured. None of the offic
ers or crew of the C-8 was hurt
According to the commander the
explosion is believed to have been
caused by rapid expansion caused by
heat. Some of the persons were blown
20 or 30 feet by the concussion:.
Houses a mile away were shaken.
The home of Mr. and Mrs. .Samuel
Pank, half a mile from the scene, was
badly damaged. Mrs. Tank was se
verely injured.
Relief was organized immediately
from the Camp Holabird hospital and
GO persons went there to have their
wounds dressed.
Samuel de Luca, a Young Men's
Christian association officer, who was
standing on the railing of the car
when the big Bag burst, was flung
several feet out of the range ot the
fire, badly burned about the hands
and legs.
Joseph Stacks, 14 years old, and
Joseph Kudek, 13, who were burned
about the face and body, figured in
one of the ireakish effects which tho
explosion produced. They were driv
ing near the balloon in a little cart
behind a pony. The explosion blew
them out of their cart and threw them
some distance.

WASHINGTON, July 1. Congress
adjourned at midnight until next
Tuesday, July 8. after enacting all
appropriation bills needed by govern
ments agencies for the new fiscal
year.
Success crowned the efforts of Re
publican leaders to complete the
necessary measures, but only after
hours of delay which at times almost
threatened to block their plans.
Pass All Appropriation . Br;;t
The final bill, the army measure,
carrying $775,000,000; the sundry
civil bill, carrying $605,000,000; the
District of Columbia's annual budget
of $15,000,000 and a deficiency meas
ure of $25,000,000 all were complet
ed tonight and tomorrow will be sent
to the White Housp. President Wil
son will be unable to approve the
bills until he returns, but no embar
rassment to government departments
through delay in making funds avail
able is anticipated. .
With enactment of the final bills
tonight. Including measures passed
at the last session of congress, more
than $5,000,000,000 has been appro
priated for federal needs during the
new year which began today. Con
gress also has cancelled more than
$15,000,000 of war appropriations pre
viously authorized.
The recess of congress was accom
plished after many delays today with
controversies centered upon the sun
dry civil and army measures. The
recess gives congress a rust over the
Fourth of July holiday and when It
returns it is expected that President
Wilson will submit the treaty nego
tiated with Germany.
Prohibition Bills Go Over
Legislation for more strict en
forcement of war-time prohibition
also is to be taken up immediately
upon reconvening.
The vote in the house in favor or
the recess was 133 to 89, while only
half a dozen senators were in thflr
seats when the session ended in the
upper branch.
The army bill as adopted repre
sents a decrease of $114,000,000 from
'th9 amount carried in the senate bill
and provides for maintenance of an
average army of 325.000 men during
the fiscal year which began today.
The conference report was approved
in the senate without a record vote.
The house in accepting the confer
ence report on the sundry civil bill
approved the senate increase of ap
propriations for the United States
employment service from $200,000,

NOW ON TRAIL
OF LIGHT
WASHINGTON, July 1. Congress
and the department of justice moved
today to stop the sale of two and three-
quarters beer under the.war time pro
hibition act.
Prohibition leaders of the house, af
ter a series of conferences, obtained a
call for a meeting Monday of the judi
ciary committee, which is expected to
agree promptly ' on an independent
bill for enforcement of the war time
law, defining intoxicating liquor as
containing more than one-naif of one
per cent alcohol, and to recommend
passage of such a bill by the house at
the earliest possible moment. At the
same time the department of justice
made it plain its agents would en
force the act, according to its Inter
pretation that anything containing
more than one-half of one per cent
alcohol cannot be legally manufac
tured or sold.
Decision of Judge Rose at Baltimore
in the brewers and two and three
quarters beer cases, and of Federal
Judge Sawtelle at San Francisco
against the brewers and such beer,
threw the entire legal status of low
alcoholic beer into uncertainty. Either
tho Baltimore, the San Francisco or
one. of the many other cases expected
to arise soon will be appealed to the
suaieme court of the United States.
However, action by congress within a
few weeks at the most, is expected to
render a decision by the supreme
court unnecessary, so far as stopping
the manufacture and sale Is concerned.

One unidentified man.
An investigation by railroad and
federal officials is said to have devel
oped Oxfaci that the air controlling
the brake on the Westerner was cut
off befween-h3 engine tender and the
first car of the train, although it was
tested in the Buffalo yards an hour
before the accident. The finding of a
body, apparently that of a tramp,
wedged in the wreckage, back of the
tender is the basis for a theory that
a man stealing a ride on the blind
end of the baggage car accidentally or
deliberately turned the cock readering
the airbrake useless throughout the
length of the train.
It is certain, J railroad and local of
ficials agree, that the proper signals
were set against tlie Westerner and
that NO. 41's flagman did all in. his
power to warn the approaching train.
The rear coach of- No. W was
thrown from the track and shattered
and three cars ahead of it were de
railed and damaged. But it was the
Westerner that suffered most. The
baggage car back of the tender was
completely demolished. The second
car, a steel day coach, swung side
ways and the sides were crushed to
gether by the grinding debris and by
the explosion of the boiler of the
Westerner's engine Most of the fa

TOLEDO, July 1. The firs, tents
were pitched in Toledo tonight with
the arrival of the vanguard of the
great crowd for the Willard-Dempsey
heavyweight championship contest
Friday. They were brought by auto
ists. With months of training at their
backs the champion and the challen
ger are virtually on edge tonight.
Nothing remains but to hold this form.
Dr. Joseph J. Sweeney, official phy
sician for the Toledo boxing commis
sion, examined Willard and said he
found him in such remarkable condi
tion that he should be able to go the
full 12 rounds at whatever speed
Dempsey eets. He said Willard's
stomach muscles are three and a half
inches thick.
Willard took a light workout today,
boxing six rounds, and will repeat this
tomorrow. Dempsey took only some
setting up exercises.
Willard's weight was announced as
245 pounds and Dempsey's 196. Train
er Jimmy DeForest said the challen
ger probably would enter the ring at
195 pounds. s

Canada Has Great
Scheme to Bldck
Labrador Current
ST. JOHNS. July 1. The mam
moth project of diverting the frigid
Labrador current and bringing the
warm waters of the Gulf Stream to
the eastern portions of Canada and
the United States l3 again being ag
itated in Newfoundland.
It is proposed to dam the straits
of Belle Isle, at the northern ex
tremity of Newfoundland. It is this
gateway between th Atlantic, and
the Gulf of St. Lawrence that lets
in the cold Labrador current, clos
ing St Lawrence ports during the
winter months.
Such a change, diverting the polar
stream to the Atlantic and allowing
the warm waters of the torrid zone
to circulate freely around eastern
shores, would increase the value of
lands and natural resources by bil
lions of dollars. It would greatly im
prove conditions f living and public
health; would release-for industries
vast quantities of fuel now used for
heating purposes; and would greatly
augment the population,., commerce
and revenue of Canada.
The ' cost would be enormous, but
the project has been pronounced free
fronf engineering difficulty,.
The Labrador current sends a
large volume of water through the
Straits of Beilo Isle, thence south
easterly along the coast of Nova
Scotia, New Brunswick and the Unit
ed States, creating a cold current,
known as the "Cold Wall," between
the Gulf Stream and the North At-
flantic Coast.
The climatic effect of the Lahrador
current on Canada covers a vast ex
tent of territory. It brings winter
earlier, making spring later and ma
terially lowers the winter temperature.

WAR BRIDES AND PROVINCIALISM
T
nMK ALL.-fcSkKl.su editorial eye. evidently lias oeen trouuieu
with a sty or latne, or it w&um nave paia more neea io
these arriving battalions of war brides.
We can see a lot of interesting eventualities trailing
along just behind these troops of English and French women, who
kave married our soldiers, or have become married unto them, and
who are coining "home" to get acquainted with "his folks."
But of one thing we are certain, their coming will forever erase
our provincialism.
In one second class American city 27 French and English brides
arrived in a few weeks, recently.
In 27 families in this city will be a mother who can tell her chil
dren of new lands, new customs, new ideals; a mother who will have
cosmopolitan children, who will go out into the world unhampered by
the old narrow viewpoint of the typical American.
And yet, children who have a higher regard for their own country,
because they w ill know what sort of a world it was "over there"
when mother was a girl.
These thousands of brides are binding the freedom-loving peo
ples, not their governments perhaps, but the peoples, together, with
thousands of invisible w ires of love and sympathy, and, in time, En
gland and France will understand that America is not exclusively
populated by red Indians, just as we are discovering that the French
man is clean-minded, and the Englishman can really see a joke with
out a reading glass.
Insularity makes for suspicion, for bigotry, and for injutsice to
our fellows. . '
The wedding rings on the graceful fingers of ten thousan war
brides are links in a golden chain of understanding that will make
war between the great nations of the world forever impossible.
NATURE LOVING AT A DISCOUNT
THE AFFECTION for the shy, more or less, things of the wlia
wood i3 likely to be somewhat curdled by a too frequent con
tact with said things.
We know acity man who became a farmer. A farmer in
a mountain district where the grouse and chipunk and the bigger
squirrel and the diicken hawk and the screech owl flourished.
And for a time he was all enthusiasm over his close touch with
naturu.
Especially was he proud of his chipmunks; cute, striped, little
frisky fellows, who had v.o fear, who invaded his shed, and then his
kitchen and kept him company- with unfailing frolic.
la time he wondered why the bottom of his scratch feed sacks
so quickly merged with the top.
One day ho endeavored to put cn a boot, that had been standing
on the back porch for a week, and, inside,, he found two quarts of
chicken feed.
He did a bit of figuring like this: If one chipmunk, in one week
in one cf a dozen hiding places, can slow away four pounds of feed
worth four an I a quarter cents a pound, what will orty chipmunks do
in forty weeks? ,
The answer appeared to bo that nature might be cute and all
that, but she was too durn expensive for his income, so he secured a
divorce, without alimony, and now chipmunks no longer frolic in hia
boots, nor do moles and shrews make of his garden a camping
ground.
Nature, you understand, is a wonderful institution, and we are
not saying a thins against, her; but the old dame has a lot of children
who have expensive tastes, and these who become wedded to her do
well to remember this, and regard with suspicion a lot of hungry
guests that will come to visit their respected relatioa
LABOR KNOWS
IT SHOCKED the boudoir Bolsheviks who were calling the spir
its of proletariah revolt from the vastly deeps of war-troubled
waters to be told by the representatives of 4,000,000 organiz
ed workers, "Clean out, we want nothing of you."
A working-class revolt without the workers, a dictatorship of the
proletariat with proletarians is truly a hard play to produce.
Union labor knows Low gains are made and held. It knows the
infinite possibilities in the way of rallying labor, in a democratic
country, for forcible upheaval. It knows the impossibility of reor
ganizing the crushing chaos that follows such an upheaval. Know
ing, labor will have none of these tactics.
These tactics have been tried. They were tried in 18S7 and
again in 1S94. The I. W. W. tries them constantly, and organized
labor's heaviest indictment of the I. W. W. is its futility. It cannot
point to a single industry and say, "Because of us hours are shorter,
wages higher, labor is wielding greater power and is organized and
disciplined to hold and utilize its gains."-
Sporadic riots, "general 6trikes," and similar upheavals, do rare
ly win victories, but never organize and utilize them. These latter
require the long training, discipline and self-control " of democratic
organization. Union men and women know this. It is bred into
their inn,er consciousness. With moi e radicals than ever befor
among its delegates the convention of the American Federation ot
Labor gave I.olshevism the bounce with slight consideration.
This is discouraging to the revolutionists of pen and platform
who have "seen the Soviet in action," and are anxious to become
Trotzkys and dictate in the name of the proletariat.
Labor does not listen to those who preach the possibilities of
mobs and ghost dances.
We are informed that the government has made an average pro
fit of ten million dollars the year on parcel post insurance. This will
come in handy to pay a part of the annual loss of the franking graft.
If Russia falls down on the payment of many more credits grant
ed by American bankers, it may become our patriotic duty to estab-,
lish law aud order over there.
Root asserts that the collector of internal revenue holds the
brewers in tho hollow of his hands. In that case, this is the logical
time to signal for the squeeze play.
Senator Knox is afraid the league will be a super-government. In
.that case it will be able to check the criminal activities of supermen.
We are warned against a general demonstration by anarchists
during the first week or July. It was during the first week of July.
1776, that Americans first decided to break away from a tyranny not
as noxious as nnurchy. .. . ... .
The American Federation of Labor has refused to endorse So
viet Russia. Lc-nine's only hope is the American Federation of
Loafers.
THE SQUEALER
It is largely because America loads the world in construction
that foreign-inspired radicals urge a poliry of destruction.

AUTO ROAD TO TOP OF
FRISCO PEAKS IS MOVING
FLAGSTAFF, JULY 1. J. W.
Weatherford has been in Flagstaff
from Phoenix the past week figuring
with contractors as to the cost of
the scenic road from Flagstaff to the
top of the San Francisco peaks, r.ir.
Weatherford has a Tight of way for
the road , secured from the govern
ment two or three years ago: but.
owing to the war and other econom-!
ic conditions, posponed the com
mencement of the enterprise. He
feels that it is a good time now to
start things going.
An auto road on a good grade to
the top of the peaks would be a big
drawing caid for tourists and a trip
that few tourists coming through the
country would not take.
The view from this point some
13,000 feet above sea level could
not be surpassed in the whole south
west. It would bring to the- eye at
lease four different states, a wonder
ful panoramic view of the northeast,
the ' Grand Canyon and a sweep of
country so vast that it would almost
take one's breath away.
As a matter of fact very few old
residents of this section of Arizona
have made this trip and they do not
fully realize the magnificence and
scenic value of this sky-high vantage
point. It is second only to a trip in
an airplane, and i3 a project which
should be heartily endorsed by local
people.
MOUNTAIN LION PLENTIFUL
IN MAZATZAL MOUNTAINS
FLAGSTAFF. July 1. Tom Cline,
who pastures his cattle on the Tonto
Forest Reserve in Mazatzal range, in
the western edge of Maricopa coun;?-,
says the mountain lions have been
worse in that section than usual, some
stockmen losing 25 per cent of the
young calves and colts.
One old lion has ranged there for
more than a year and he kills a calt
about every other day.
Mr. Cline has just rounded up and
sold his yearling steers that weighed
about 550 pounds, at 7 1-2 cents a
pound. The bunch brought over $41
a head.
The range is exceedingly good and
more stock would do well if permit
ted. As it is the number must not be
increased so steers are sold as yea--lings.
These go to Colorado for pas
ture and later to be fed out for mar
ket. Mr. Cline gathered a bunch ol
fat, barren cows for which he hopes
to get 8 cents.
The range fees have been raised
to $1 a head, but even at this stock
men are doing well.
Mr. Cline says ranges will be good
all season as the early rains have
brought ample brouse, the principal
feed in that section. Phoenix Messenger.

in the mountains to which he had fled
immediately after the killing.
The killing is alleged to have
taken place at a dance on the Moqul
reservation, a revolver being the
weapon used. Kee Chee lived uua
the following day.
United States Commissioner M. A.
Murphy held the preliminary hearing
of the Indian, who in default of the
$2500 bond, is awaiting "time of hrs
trial in the local jaiL
It is a peculiar custom among the"
Navajos of bringing in their own rei-j
atives and turning them over to the
authorities when charged with crime, j
WTiile they will, usually do this of;
their own accord, it is seldom possiole
for white officers to make an arrest
directly.

Airplane Manufacturing Company or
Los Angeles ha sagrecd to furnish an
airplane and a. stunt aviator for the
occasion. The deal has been closed

will be made both days, and the con
tract with the company calls for
"sensational" antics, including such
stuff as looping the loop, daylight
fireworks, etc. It is not known
whether any passengers will be given
a lift heavenward or not. This attrac
tion has been furnished by the Elks
absolutely free to citizens and visi
tors at a tremendous expense and is
but another evidence of their deter
mination to make the clebration the
best ever.

STOCK SAND BONDS I
NEW YORK, July 1. Dealings In
stocks today were decidely mixed and
irrgeular as to standard shares, wnile
specialties of various descriptions
continued their upward course under
the guidance of porfessional interests.
There was no obvious factor of influ
ence other than the money situation.
Mixed collateral ruled at 8 per cent,
but as high as 12 was demanded for
all industrial security.
Texas and Pacific again proved su
perior to the heaviness ot otner rails,
mounting-to the new high record of
6SV& on absorption of the same sub
stantial character as has characteriz
ed its steady rise of recent months.
Food issues and relater can shares,
equipments .tobaccos, rubbers, ship
pings, coppers and equipments provid
ed the motive power of the session
at gross gains of 2 to almost 8 points.
United States Steel rose spiritedly
in the last hour to 1.09, its top price
in several weeks. Oils were restrain;
ed by the Mexican situation and In
dustrial alcohol was subjected to fur
ther pressure on reports affecting its
dividend. Sales amounted to 1,200,000
shares.
Attention was drawn to the foreign
exchange market by the heavines of
sterling, demand bills declining 4.574,
the lowest rate in almost four years.
In banking circles no explanation was
vouchsafed excepting the heavy offer
ings of bills.
Domestic and foreign bonds, includ
ing Liberty issues, were irregular. To
tal sales ,par value, were $10,800,000.
Old United States bonds were un
changed on call. .
THE GRAIN MARKETS
CHICAGO, July 1. Substantially
higher prices which prevailed today
for corn resulted to a great extent
from the fact that hog values had
climbed to a pinnacleof $21.75 a hun
dred weight. The corn market closed
unsettled at lc to 2c net advance
with September $1.78 to $1.78 and
December $1.56 to $1.5678. Oats
gained c to 2c and. provisions 35c to
65c
With the hog market ascending to
unprecedented levels, corn showed an
upward slant almost uniformly
throughout the day. The fact that li
quidation of July contracts on the part
of unlicensed dealers was at an end
formed an additional stimulus to buy
ers ,and so, too did more or less gen
eral doubt as to whether after all the
manufacturers of beer yould be
stopped. Moreover .estimates were
current that the 1919 yield of corn in
the United States would be hardly
more than equal to domestic needs.
Reports of excessive heat led to
doubt the concerning of oats in im
portant sections where the corn is now
in a critical stage. Buying of oats for
investment was said to have broaden
de out.
Provisions ascended with hogs anil
grain. The best demand came from
commission houses.

Mrs. Cooper, Age 72, Says She Never
Felt Better In Her Life Tan
lac Ends 25 Years Trouble
"The past winter was the first one
I have gone through in 15 years witn
out having La Grippe and I attribute
it to the way Tanlac built me up,"
was the remarkable statement made
by Mrs. T. A. Cooper of 1147 Irola
street. Los Angeles, in an interview,
recently.
Mrs. Cooper, who is well known in
the literary field, has been writing
for some of the magazines for years.
She also writes "movie" stories ano
is at the preesnt time writing a spe
cial story for one of our most popu
lar screen actiesses.
When asked if she was willing to
have her statement, regaring Tanlac
published Mrs. Cooper said: "Yes, In
deed, and jou may tell them thar
when I began taking the' medicine 1
only weighed 98 pounds; but, that I
now weigh 126, making an actuar
gain of 2S pounds..
"For 25 years I have had catarrh
in my head. Ten years ago the
trouble reached my .stomach ana
made me most miserable. I got so I
could not eat at all without bloating
all up and suffering for hours. The
gas would press on my heart anpr
bring on such awful spells of palpita-l
tion that I would almost faint. I was
so nervous the least noise would
startle me and make me tremble like
a leaf. 1 tried many different kinds
worse until I reached the point where
wors until I reached the point wnerc
I could not get around at all.
"1 was almost a confirmed invaiii
for a long time and not until last
fall when I got Tanlac was I able to
find anything to help me. Well, al
most from the time I began taking
Tanlac I commenced to improve. Of
course, when I found it was helping
mo I kept on taking it until now 1
can eat and drink just anything i
want. The gas has left my stomacu
entirely and my nerves are as goon
as eve", and while I am now 72 years
of ago I don't believe I ever fell
-stronger and better. The only medi
cine I keep in my house now is Tan
lac and the Laxative Tablets that
come with it. 1 consider it the finesv
treatment for stomach trouble and it
run-down condition there is and I will
bo glad to tell anyone who cares to
call me up what it has done for inl
and what I believe it will do for
them."

III, WHITER
ITALIAN PAPER
SCORES WILSON
ROME, July 1 Critical comment on
President Wilson's sojourn In Europe
is made today in the Tribuna, in dis
cussing hi3 return to the United
States.
"Seven months ago an immense
halo of popularity surrounded Presi
dent Wilson," the Tribuna editorial
says. "Europe awaited him as the
Messiah in a new era of history, while
now he leaves amidst almost general
indifference, appearing as an intruder
in our continental history, our Euro
pean civilization and our sacred
ideals.
"It has been a psychological drama.
as President Wilson believes, perhaps
sincerely, that he incarnated not only
the aspirations of America, but also
the aspirations of Europe. Instead
President Wilson, despite his pure in
tentions, failed of his object. He re
turns to America leaving behind him
a chaos or aisoruer, passion ana dis
illusion, since he could not conclude
peace according to his principles, but
by a compromise brought about by
the overbearing attitude of the strong
toward the weak."

Soldiers Hurt, Six
Horses Killed By
Douglas Lightning
Bisbee was visited with a heavy
shower last evening which consider
ably relieved the warm spell the city
has had during the past wpek.
At Douglas there was a much heav
ier storm along with some electrical
disturbances which killed six horses
at Camp Harry Jones and injured six
of the men who were out on the picket
line. The streets of Douglas were
flooded with some two feet of water
which filled the basements of several
stores and ran into the Copper Queen
store, the Club cafe and all the stores
which were below the curb line.
Electricity hit the flag pole on the
J. C. Penny bulding scattering pole
and brick from the building over the
street in front of the store.' T'n
lightning which hit and killed the
horses made a hole about six feet
deep in the ground.
The six soldiers were unconscious
from the effect of the shock for some
time and late last evening two of the
,men had not as yet regained consci
ousness. The rain commenced about 4 o'clock
i.i the afternoon and continued to
come down till about 8 o'clock.
