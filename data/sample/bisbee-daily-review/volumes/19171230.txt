lieed in southern Arizona for many!
years, was in the city yesterdey for j
several hours, conierring with D. C.
O'Neil on the advisability of construct

his fr.w.ds and patrons may enjoy all
the ease and comtort of life.
"When interviewed yesterday on
the proposition, Mr. O'Neil said that
neither he nor Mr. Cassady had any
thing to say. excepting that it would
be one of the most wonderful under
takings possible. That they would
endeavor to give their guests some
thing newer and more novel in amuse

had ever before experience-d. -when the
hotel and resort is completed.
There life will run along like some
grand, sweet song, according to Mr.
O'Neil, and he has decided to make
Billy Bask well, the genial clerk of the
Gadsden, manager -of the new hotel.
As Billy is noted for his gracious hos

he will be an important adjunct to the
hotel life.

surrounded by an admiring group of

for him to break away in time to
keep a hunting appointment with his

Confers With Oiheis With
View of Forming Perman

District to Handle Future
Loans.
W. H. Clifford of the Federal Re
serve bank at Dallas. Tex., was in the
city a few days ago on business per
taining to Liberjy loan matters. He
was in consultation with local bank
ers: Tom Ecan. secretary of the Com
mercial club, anl a number of others
who worked for the loan in the recent
campaign, with the idea in view of
perfecting a permanent Liberty loan
organization here.
"The only business the country has
today ts the business of winning the
war!" said Mr. Clifford. "Our gov
ernment has one of the largest jobs
on hand that any nation ever had.
We do not know w hen we will win the
war. but we do know that a lung as
the war lasts money must be raised
by the sale of war loans to finance it.
The business of selling these war
bond has become a big proposition,
and it is the wish of the treasury de
partment at Washington that Liberty
loan organizations throughout the
country remain intact, so as to be
ready when the loans are launched.
"The time for the next loan has not
been announced, but will probably be
in February.
"Arizona did her full share and
more in the two Liberty loan cam
paigns that have been put over, and
the .letdquarters at Dallas has noth
ing but congratulations to offer you.
We know that you will keep tip the
good w-ork. Cochise county raised al
most three times its quota on the
last loan.
"The time has ccme when every ,
man and woman in this country must
become identified with some line of
war work: not to work at it by fits
and jerks, but to make it a daily task.
Our soldiers and sailors enlist for
three and four year periods; surety
we can enlist for war work for as kxig ;

main at home and enjoy all the com-)
forts of life. There la no lark of op
portunity to do war work at home,
and consistent, earnest effort in some
war winning activity is the plain
duty ef every man and woman from
now on.
"If we win this war you most help.
Buy liberty bonds and war saving cer
tificates, and thus lend your money to
the government at 4 per cent in
terest the best secured loan on
earth; work for the Red Cross, the V.
M. C A. war section and food con
servation; dont be a slacker. Ask
yourself the question: "What am 1

science is not clear, get busy and do
your tead level best from now on.
Be a real, sure enough citizen of the

The local draft board at Tombstone
will release some of the registrants
who had been called to go with the
final 15 per cent and who have been
holding themselves in readiness tor
the past few months, and they may
not be sent at this time to join the

The government has decided that
the final 15 per cent will be class!
fied with all the other registrants
and the 15 per cent made up from
Class L which in many cases e in
cludes those selected originally for
the fifteen per cent.
The new order is as follows:
"It has been decided that there will
be no more formal calls for deferred
percentages of the present quota be
fore February 15- While boards
should, until they have enough men
finally classified in Class I. send for
ward promptly men selected under
the old regulations to make tip defi
ciencies in calls already made, the
result of this decision will be that
we shall be able to give the benefit
of the new classification system to all
men whose order numbers are so late
as to place tbem within deferred per
centages of the present call. Calls
will, however, be made very shortly
under the provisions of Section 149
for the special class of men there
mentioned. For the sake of compos
ing the public mind aud for the con

tion ought to be given wide dissemi

The class of men named in Section
149. and for whom rails will shortly
be made includes technical and other
experts and registrants highly skilled
In some special line of work.
As the work of classification will
have been accomplished by February
15. the registrants who will be called
to fill the final fifteen per cent will
be filled from Class I and may ex

HARVELOUSLY ON
WESTERN FROOT
FRENCH FRONT. Dec. i Cor
respondence of the Associated Press.!
One million casualties have been suf
fered by the German armies along the
front occupied by the French troops
during 1917. according to statistics
carefully compiled here. French ter
ritory amounting to many hundreds
of square miles has been freed from
German domination by the year's fight
ing and the German Crown Prince
Frederich has been compelled to suf
fer modification of leaving between
$0,000 and 70,lH prisoners from among
his best troops in French hands. His
cannon to the number of 1.404 have
been captured, and. in addition, thou
sands of machine guns and hundreds
of trench mortars.
Although the defeated Germans did
their utmost before with drawing to
turn the fertile fields and picturesque
villages of the Somme and Aisne re
gions into a desert waste, these acts
of Tandalism did them more harm
than it did the French, whose soldiers
were stirred thereby to an even strong
er determination than before to beat
ba k the German invader.

CENTRAL CONSUMERS CO., Inc., Louisville, Ky.
NEW YORK. 1W. 2 The move
inent of stocks dnrinc today's short
but active session was rather mixed,
despite Indications of general strength.
Low priced rails were In further
demand, especially westem and south
western issnes. while standard shares
laeged.
Trad in motors was extensive,
with extreme pains of one to four
and a half points in Studebaker. Gen
eral Motors. Willys-Overland and n
few accessories.
Equipments and the war division
as a whole tended toward higher lev
els. United States Steel fluctuated
fractionally, dosing virtually unchang
ed. Cains in specialties were reduced,
however, heavy selling ensuing on
rumors of a British marine disaster.
The hank statement disclosed im
portant changes in local monetary
conditions. Actual loans showed the
national decrease of J44.615.000. and
last week's severe drain on reserves
was partly made up by an increase of
?25.0u0.0t'O.
Bonds were active on an enlarged
inquiry for domestic issues. liberty

and 3's at 98.50 to 98.42. Total

GRAIN MARKET.
CHICAGO. Pec. 29. With railroads
handicapped by the cold wave and
with receipts consequently dwarfed,
the grain market today had an upward
slant throughout the session. Corn
closed steady at the same as yester-i
day's finish to ? higher. Oats gain
ed Vi to ISc net. In provisions,
there was aa advance ranging from
seven "to 45c.
Unfavorable conditions for thai
movement of the crop made the hard-)
ening of the corn market a foregone
conclusion. Bullish sentiment, though.
was held in check by ,rospecU that
government measures would before
long bring a Wit some degree of re
lief. Meanwhile, rural offerings con
tinued light and pit transactions kept
within hollda touuds.
Oats although only fairly active,
went to the highest price recorded yet
this season. The impetus came large
ly from reports of sales to the sea
board, liecember delivery made the
sharpest upturn and as a precaution
against a possible year-end squeeze
cn Monday, the exchange directors
this afternoon gave notice that no De
cember dealings would be allowed at
any figure exceeding five cents aboe
the current price of the May option.
Buying for stockyard interests lift
ed provisions after some weakness at
the start. Demand as based on
opinions that the cold wave would re
tard shipments of hogs to packers.

This motto of a famous society, written by Edward Everett Hale, is a good

"Happy New Year with the world still burdened with war, may seem hard

plan a Happy New Year; and "lend a hand" to make it so.
We extend this wish to all our friends

Overcoals
Are the Thing
Here is only one of the many late
styles in overcoats for men and young
men to be seen at this store.
They're built for comfort as well
as smartness; with patch pockets,
belts all around, convertible collar,
knee or calf length. The belt gives
a slight suggestion of the figure and
a snug "altogether feeling. Made
by

The fabrics in these coats are ex
ceptionally good, all-wool and in all
colors. You can't help but like them ;
they're all good to look at.

"When I bought my bot le of
Tanlac I felt Kke it was that much
money thrown away, so my wonJerful
recover has astonished me." saM
Mrs. P. A. Johnson, who residvs at
202 Third street. El Pao, Tevas. a few
days a;o.
"For eight years." she Di.tt-ii-ed.
"I have been physically brokort down
and have suffered lorrjies it ! rheu
matism, indisestion and nervousness.
My whole body emed to b? afiected
with thcumatism and my joluts were
swollen and pained ri so I wis al
most helpless. My less tun me so
bad 1 couldn't be;?r my Ii!t m them
and I haj to use crot.'hej and t.t
helped about. Nothing I wou'd eat
agreed with me and my stomach w
in sucii an awrul shspe ttiit 1 cjun't
stand anything ticht around me. For
months at a tune I i:ve1 on liijui I
diet and even this at time caused me
trouble. The gas on my stomach af
fected my heart so sometimes I felt
like every breath wo'iH b? my last
and my nerves were simply shattered
to pieces. I also suffered terribly
from constipation and headaches and
never knew what it was to sleep more
than two hours any nv'hL
"Honestly. I have spent three
fourths of my time during the past
two years flat on my bi'A in bed and
have taken meditin tiptil my hous
looks like a drug store. 1 have spent
many a dollar with li'il or no resu'.t. i
I was told my trouble was caused by
appendicitis and when I wns op?rared
on and sti!l suffered just as bad as
ever, I became disovra?e I and felt
that I would never get w!I. I could
just feel myself goir.s from bad tc
worse every dav. A friend of mine
urged me to try Tanlar and I am now
on my third bottte. have gained six
teen pounds and a hut and am al
ready feeling like a nerv wom.tn. It's
a positive fact, these three bottles of
Tanlac hare done me more so-id thaa
other treatment and meuioines that
have cost men hundreds of dollars.
The pain and swelling caused by the
rheumatism has entirely left me. 1
eat just any and everythin I want
without it hurting me and sleep every
aight like a child. My nerves are
steady as a clock and I really haven't
felt so well ia eieht jers and my
friends are all talkins about my won
derful improvement."

RESUME OF VMS 111 DISTRICT
AND STATE AT LARGE SHOWS GOOD
UNDERLYING SITUATION FOR 1918
i
Federal Helps in Fair Metal Prices and in Interpretations of ,
Tax Law Will Be Necessary Unless Given, Small Pro
ducers Will Be Wiped Out and Larger Concerns Much
Crippled.
Information front the different mining districts of the state brings out
the features:
Conservation is greater and more determined among workingmen than
erer before.
Growth along this line is continuing steattily. caused by growing appre
ciation of the need of the government cf loyalty on the pert of all citizens.
inj greatly assisted by tte elimination to a very considerable extent of Aus
trian trouble makers. L. W. W. and other radical prxvCermaa agitators from
employment among the men.
High Grade Mining Compulsory
Production of metal is picking up. but not of ore tonnage, while develop
ment work continues to lag. These conditions are In the main due to the
necessity the producers are under to mine less quantity and more quality,
their higher grade ores, in order to sell copper on a 13 -cent market, and to
uncertainty as to the near future price the government will fix for the metals
they are mining, upon which price will depend the exact number of mining
and development work campaigns wiiich can be followed.
Income Tax
The income tax law interpretations
another factor in the hesitancy on Uie
as to fdtnre steps. UntU ther know
to pay. some producers are compelled
Decisions in either this matter or in
putting them out of business.
Workmen Are Loyal
Except for adverse conditions recited, Arizona would at this time be in
exceptionally fair way to output more copper and sflTer early in the new
year than ever before ia er history. Sufficient American labor is avail
tble in tt-e vsriic'' min:cg districts to attain this result, provided the prices
fixed will permit mining the lower grade ores, and the efficiency of the labor
steadily increasing. A good deal of it is made up of recruits drawn during
the summer and fall from the agricultural sections who have since made
good miners. They have drawn other men from their former homes and
are making competent miners of these. Coming as they did. they have been
wary or the agitators and have helped much in building up the strength
with Tilth conservative union men and unorganized men are now Jointly
opposing all attempts to bring back disturbance of labor conditions in the
state.
Only the Chanca Is Required
Condition of nines and new development in the state is the most favor
able in the history of the Arizona copper industry for important gains in
production, provided the producers can have the fair co-operation of the
government. This is true despite some falling behind in development in the
larger mines; damage sustained during the strike period and some encroach
ment that a part of the producers have been compelled to make upon their
higher grade ore bodies; some because of the price fixed for the metal, and
so:ne because of combination of this circumstance and a period of short or dis
turbed labor supply.
Equipped for Maximum Results
Offsetting this is the greater plant equipment possessed by the copper
industry in the state, all of which has been brought to the utmost in facility
for efficiency during the present year. Unite! Verde smelter. Humooldt
smgelter. International smelter at Miami. New Cornelia plant at AJo. are
instances in point, with improvements brought into effect within the last
six months representing possible gain in the- output of upwards of S.OOO.WH)
pounds of copper the month. Harden and Stsco smelters of the A. S. & R.,
the Douglas smelters of Copper Queen and Calumet & Arizona. Shannon
and Arizona Copper company plants at Clifton, have also lifted their capaci
ties and efficiency to seme extent, providing way for an additional 5.000.000
pounds gain the month in output if given the chance. The latter must be
considered as including an advance In the price of copper that will take care
of practically 2 cents per pound which has been added to cost in the last
i
quarter through lilglier fuei and other supply charges, exclusive of taxes,
and that will take care of advance in wages that must come with advance
in the price of copper, and which may be necessary whether the price or
cctpper is raised or not. Unless shoes, clothing and food prices go down,
present wages will not long suffice the Arizona worklngman with a family,
a fact that Is realized by mine operators, but before which, tn view of de
uncertainties of government action in price and tax matters, they are as
helpless a the operative. There must also be assurance of adequate deliv
eries of fuel and other supplies over the railroads, a matter that has as yet
made no acute disturbance of operating conditions, except among some ot
the smaller shipping camps, but which has occasioned a great deal of con
stant worry and some attendant loss of efficiency ever since the spring
months.

DOUGLAS MUST MAKE
CLEAN-UP OR GAMP

EE M
Government Officials Do Not
Mince Words in Stating
Condition of the City AH
Sorts of Crime Prevail.

Alexander Boy Backs Or. E. A. Edwards J
DOUGLAS It has been announced
that the city authorities will cooper-:
ate w-tn the military and department
of justice -officers in driving from
Douelas the various forms of vice
which have keen increasing at an
alarming rate in recent months. It is
not probable that bootieggiag is in
creasing, for illegal liquor traffic
has been "running full blast" .here
ever since the state prohibition law
became effective. A shake-op in the
police department some time ago
failei to cut down the bootlegger's
activities an iota.
The military authorities, aided by
the department of justice men. have
been waging a relentless warfare on
liquor, prostitutes, gamblers, drug .
fiends and others whose presence is a
detriment to the community, and. des
pite their lack of familiarity with the
section, have made a splendid record.
Swarms of Undesirables
Not witbstan ding the energetic ef
forts made to clean np the city, the
influx of undesirables has almost
swamped those who nave been doing
all within their power to suppress im
morality, and more drastic measures
have been made necessary- Wednes
day afternoon a conference was held
by representatives of the military, tne
federal and city authorities, and plans
laid to deal with the situation in an
effective manner. There will be no ,
half measures from now on.
"Douglas is rotten to the core. said
a man connected with the federal gov
ernment recently. "The average law
abiding citizen may not know it. but
this city is in a v.orse condition mor
ally than any other place in the south-'
west. In my capacity as a federal of
ficer I am charged with doing, what
ever I can to remedy the present state '
of affairs and I propose to go ahead
with every means I know to help make '
this city acceptable to the govern-'
ment as a place to train soldiers.
"The nation is involved in the great
est war of all time. Its very exist
ence is at stake. The men it sends to
Europe to make sure its existence as
a democratic government must go
abroad with every atom of strength
and vitality. To send them to France
with their bodies sapped by the in
fluence of alcohol and poisoned by
disease would be to invite disaster to '
American arms. The war department
has set out to protect the manhood of
its soldiers, and it will not permit
them to be stationed in any communi
ty where conditions are such as to'
imperil their efficiency. If the people ,
of Do-JElas want to Save soldiers
ttainfd here, they must unite their
efforts with those who are striving
to make the city clean, and see tiat
the work is successfully performed.
"I is certain that soldier will not
be kept long in a community where
their welfare is endangered. It is
about time for the people of Douglas ,
to ake up to this fact." i
Must Improve Conditions
This is plain talk and it is plain
truth. There are indications that a
larger number of soldiers than ever
before stationed ia Douglas toon will
be in training h"re. but they certainly
will nut be sent to this place if eon-!
ditions ere not improved.
This talk of drawing a deadline on
a specific street between tae down
town sections if the city is not made
clean, is aside from the intentions.
Nothing like that will be done in a
small place like Douglas, but some
thing a great deal more drastic will
be dene, ar.d will be done speedily un
less the city gets busy and takes its
bkirts from the mir and that will b
the removal from here of every sol
dier. Do yon think this would not
be done? W-eiL you are badly mis
taken. One instance ran be cited to
"unfool" you.
The Palo Alto Case
At Palo Alto. CaL. several weeks
ago there was a clash between state
and military authorities. The state
became is-sistent in regard to a cer
tain thing and the point at issue was
not as serious as the one under dis
cussion here and the war department
was in:ormed that certain conditions
would not be modified.
Did the war department comply?
Not rou' h. It ordered a whole division
to change its training place, and. in
stead of being placed in cantonments
in California they were shun led
across the continent to Charlotte.

Alexander Roy Predicts Very Heavy Gushers
For the Chino Valley Oil Fields .
Dr. Edwards, Vice-President of the ARIZONA OIL AND REFIN
ING COMPANY, asked ALEXANDER ROY for a signed statement
The statement is printed below and. is worthy of careful study.
t
ARIZONA OIL AND REFINING COMPANY,
Phoenix, Ariz.
Gentlemen:
In regard to giving you a statement of the possibilities of the
Chino Valley oil fields after my recent visit to that section, I am only
too happy to state that from my viewpoint on the subject, this is going:,
to be an exceptionally rich field. I predict this from the depth of oil
sands encountered in the first well.
Of course, we all know that in testing out an oil field, it is always
best to sink three or four wells and get the full average production of
what each well will make, but there is a greater opportunity here in
sinking to a lower depth, as the oil sands which have been cut are only
the upper miocene sands carrying the paraffin oil. I feel that if we
go through the lower miocene to the asphalt oil we stand an excellent
opportunity of getting some very heavy gushers, as the flow and
seepage from beneath the mountains in the neighborhood is bound to
be very great.
There is ample territory to drill on and I am asking you for a
lease of 1 60 acres for a few of my friends to go in on. 1 would prefer
a northside of the anticline, but this is more for convenience of work
ing than that I estimate there will be a greater volume of oil there than
on the southern side of the anticline.
I feel that you have a good proposition that has all the ear-marks
of a winner. You will have to exercise considerable care in getting
through the water at the 300 so as not to drown out your well. How
ever, I think that you have at your command men who understand all
about this, and it is not necessary for me to comment upon it.
I would advise you to place one well on each ten acres so that
your tract would give you about 64 of these wells. If you are only
going to open miocer.e oil or paraffin oil, you can calculate out what
sort of an investmert this would be, but I would advise you to
sink one or two wells to the lower asphalt oil, as I firmly believe that
the great flow from the mountains in the neighborhood would surpass
any ideas that you have on the subject. Yours very truly,
(Signed) ALEXANDER ROY.
ACTUAL OIL DEVELOPMENT
The ARIZONA OIL AND REFINING COMPANY-are going after
the oil the oil which was found in the first discovery well the oil
which Dr. Etienne A. Ritter says should be there the oil which E.
Ronald Sager says is there somewhere the oil which Dr. E. A. Ed
wards the noted geologist in charge of the operations of the ARI
ZONA OIL AND REFINING COMPANY is going to find the oil
which Alexander Roy consulting geologist for many of the great
Arizona mining corporations says in a recent interview "you should
strike paraffin oil at 1 800 feet but if you will go 2000 feet further
you should get a gusher."
The ARIZONA OIL AND REFINING COMPANY have a complete
equipment which is now on their ground in the Chino Valley oil
fields of Arizona. They are not going to buy an outfit which, by
the way, costs from eight to ten thousand dollars but they already
have it the Company has a substantial treasury of spot cash also
has our word in black ar.d white that we will raise at least another
$25,000 for actual development account to carry the well to a depth
to strike the "gusher territory" which Alexander Roy talks about.

WEEKLY NEWS LETTER YOUflG
liEH'S CHRISTIAN ASSOCIATION
OF WARREH IMnG DISTRICT
For Borne of the "doubting Thorn-1
ases," who try to kid themselves into
believing that the T secretary who
goes Oversea has a soft berth, we
clip the following press dispatch front
Paris, under date of November 29th:
"Refreshments and amusements were
provided for the first American
troops stationed for train lag in the
first line trenches by the American
Army and Navy Young Men's Christ
ian association. This work began in
a cow shed in a tittle village just be
hind the fitmt lines, under the direc
tion of Ira D. Shaw, s former Colum
bia university football player. The
equipment to begin with consisted
only of a small supply of chocolate.

the hut on their way "up the line.'
Later, the cow shed was abandoned
for a large habitable room with a
splendid topea fireplace. The associa
tion headquarters in Paris largely
augmented the supply ot refreshments
and provided mags lines, writing pa
per and a talking machine, which was
on "active service' from early morn
ing until late at might. Each evening
groups of tired, wet American infan
trymen and their French comrades-in-arms
flocked to the room for a bit ot
entertainment. The barking ot the
75s need by the American as the
sneJls started for the German lines
could be heard plainly within the hut.
Nearby were dugouts for shelter when
the German shells came tot) close tor
comfort. Not many kilometers from
this advance hut was another that
ortsinally was a French barracss. It
was gladly turned over to the Amer
ican association, which served there
both French and American soldiers. It
had a canteen, writing material and
two coal fire which were kept sup
plied by French soldiers. The T. M.
C A. secretaries did ont confine their
work to the huts, but went altrf&st to
the front trenches with newspapers,
msgaxlnes. tobacco and other sup
plies. Even John Nelson has taken on a
new hope since the "scoop" about
Henry Aiken and his bright prospects
of wedded bliss durins 1918. John
says there are many ot them he can
get "just for the Axln."

Clifton-Morenci Situation
The year has been anything but a
kindly one to the Clifton-Morenci dis
tricts. They hao practically five
months of strike The latter and the
nltmate provisions of the president's
mediation board, may have settled the
labor situation for several years to
come. However, the Clifton-Morenci
population is largely foreign and pe
culiarly susceptible to the pro-German
aritatnr. Another thing, these dis-l
tricts are Rw grade and the present
price of copper leaves them exceeding
ly narrow margin on which to op
erate. Despite the discouragements
that have thus beset them from va
rious angles, the Clifton-Morenci ope
rators have r!ven for expeanMon and
not in vain. The Shannon manage
ment has bpn particularly active tn
research for increased and desirable
ore resources, both in the home prop

Globe-Miami District Active
The strike period broke into general
mining and development activities in
tte Globe-Miami districts second only
to that prevalent in the Verde dis
trict. Resumption has been slow,
as much because of price and tax in
terpretation problems as because of
the attitude of the operators against
other than loyal American forces in
all operating divisions, following the
Bisbee plan in this respect and adher
ing strictly to the ruling ot the pres
ident's mediation board as to the re
placement of persons known to have
anti-government. pro-German inclina
tion. Old Dominion mines and plants
are back to normal output and will be
able to sustain this in the event of
copper remaining at present price. On
an increase, this and some other
mines in the district would be able to
lift their output somewhat higher,
through reaching into more of their
low-grade ores. Miami Copper com
pany may make 5.000.000 pounds this
months and in January should attain its
normal capacity of near six million.

Tombstone, and has been here for th.v
past several days, having several'
cases before the local superior court.;
It was told on Cleery today, by several
of his friends, that when the news'
spread throushout the city that the
local folk were about to start a bis
dri.e. that Rill became highly nervous
and immediately began to scan the
available scnediles aud time tables,
and take hasty note of the various
reads leading out of town. However'
one of Cieary's friends, so it is told. ;
quietly went up to 1U1! and notified
him that the drive on in Tombstone
today was only to be a Red Cross '
crive. The news of the reinstate-
ment of former Governor 11 ant by the
supreme court is said to tave been
joyfully received by Cleary and it Is

One of the best developed properties
;n the Cherry distritt is owned by the
Verde Inspiration company. There are
several parallel uveitis traversing the
property, which have been extensively
developed. The Etta mine Is an ex
ample of what can be done with the
mines of the district, it having pro
duced over a half million dollars in
gold by amalgamation. As depth is
attained on the veins, the gold values
tave turned into pood grade chalco
pyrite. In the case of the Verde Inspi
ration mine, several deep shafts have
been sunk on different portions of the
veins. The 20-ton stamp mill has
handled sufesfully all the ore that
has been mined. The plan is to in
crease the capacity of the stamps and
rs install a complete concentration
and cyanide equipment. There are
about J0.OH tons jf oxidized gU ore
bloc-lied out and there is much more
ground that has not been developed
that will carry this same quality of
gold ore. The ore t hat has been mill
ed will average about JliOO a ton in
gold. Already in the deepest workings
this g'ald ore has becua ta turn Into
the characteristic chalccpyrite. which
will cause phe company to add the flo
tation process to the mill methods.
