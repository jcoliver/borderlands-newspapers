armistice are reported to have started

power of granting or denying to the

Meanwhile the great battle which
has as its purpose the driving-of the
Germans from French and Belgian
soil conlinues from the Meuse river
to Belgium. Everywhere the Ger

the vast sack is being cleared of
enemy forces.
Sedan, famous as a fortress in the
Franco-Prussian war and the back
bone of the German line of retreat
from the southern portion of the bat
tle front, is partly in the hands of
the American troops and with its fall
will vanish all the dreams of the Ger
mans of being able to fall behind the
line 67 the river Meuse and hold a
footing on French soil west of the
Luxenmburg border. Also by the cap

ment as the result of widely cir

which might confirm the false an-'

"Any such report Is absolutely

In what is reported to have been a
premature explosion of part of the

to set off at the end of their shift, two
men were killed and one badly injured
early - this morning at the Denn-Ari-zoua
mine. Andy Johnson was the

The other bodies had not been brought

It was not possible to obtain exact

Borne of them exploded prematurely.
They were working in a drift on the

SAGE RECEIVED HERE
(Special to The Review)
TUCSON, Ariz., Nov. 7. Convinced
that in no other way can they have
hope of winning out against Thomas
E. Campbell, the democratic state cen
tral committee is planning t initiate
a contest in the courts, it was inti
mated broadly in messages received
here from Phoenix tonight. At pres
ent, it was stated, the committee ap
parently is casting about for some
method of bringing action. Should this
be aone the same weary months, of
legal bickering witnessed when Camp
bell was deprived of office two years
ago, probably would be re-enacted, but
with different result.
A message received from Phoenix
late tonight said that even with all
outstanding precincts going against
him, Campbell had a sate lead of 350
votes over Colter, at the least.
COLTER CLAIMS DROP
After maintaining that Colter was
elected by more than lOo votes, early
yesterday evening, Leroy Ladd in a
messeage received here at 10:30 last
night stated that Colter was still in
the lead by 44 votes. He urged politi
cal workers here to be cautious in the
extreme and intimated that the ballot
boxes should be guarded, etc., as the
result would be close and in grave
doubt. It wag believed here that this
might presage a contest.
The statement was made here late
yesterday by several Colter men that
they believed Campbell was elected.
However, with the receipt of Ladd's
message last night, they renewed their
solid front and claimed Colter yet had
I a chance.
Everywhere, however, when tho
chance of a contest being brought was
mentioned, there were expressions of
great distaste for the idea.
BOTH CLAIM ELECTION
PHOENIX. Ariz., Nov. 7. No reli
able compilation of figures on the gov
ernorship contest has been attempted
by either the republicans or the demo
crats. The former have reduced their
claims of the election of Thomas E.
Campbell to figures below 250. The
democrats are claiming the election of
Fred T. Colter by less than 100. Com
plete returns on the governorship elec
tion have been received from only one
county, Cochise, where Colter was giv
en a majority of S29. The majority in
this county for Campbell with only
two precincts missing is 2798.
There are only the most fragmen

the vote for other state officers or

LONDON, Nov. 7. 11:18 p. m.
According to the Press Associa
tion up to 5 o'clock tonight neith
er the British nor the French gov
ernments had received any news
of an armistice being signed.
The British government was in
telephonic communication with
Versailles and says the Press As
sociation, it could be stated defi
nitely that the rumor was un
founded. WASHINGTON. Nov. 7. Late
tonight the American government
had not been advised of the out
come of the meeting between
Marshal Foch and the German
armistice envoys, arranged to take
place within the French lines at 5
o'clock this afternoon. Paris time.
The state department author
ized from time to time during the
evening reiterations of an official
denial .ssued by Secretary Lans
ing at 2:15 p. m.. of the false re
port of the signing of an armistice
which had thrown Washington
with other cities of the country
into an uproarous premature
peace celebration. Official dis
patches added nothing to informa
tion received during the day an
nouncing that the German repre
sentatives were approaching the
western front.
Mr. Lansing's statement, supported
by a similar one from Secretary Baker
and displayed on newspaper bulletin
boards failed to check the wildly en
thusiastic demonstration which start
ed when an afternoon paper appeared
on the street with the false story
spread across the first page in black
type. The report spread over the
city by word of mouth and telephone
and soon bells were ringing, whistles
blowing and the streets thronged with
people.
For a time the citizens' committee
which had planned demonstrations in
anticipation of peace within a few
days held their balance and announced
their determination to await an of
ficial announcement. But exictement
on the streets rose to hysteria, crowds
assembled before the White House
and government departments and soon
the committees were as wild as any
body else and the demonstration wa
under way. Floats and banners were
paraded on Pennsylvania avenue and
other broad thoroughfares bands play
ed and banners were hoisted.
Before the White House a cheering
mob surged the gates callins for "Wil

table to see what it was al! about
and his appearance on the veranda
was the signal for an outburst that

but be quickly disappeared within the
White House doors apparently realiz
ing bis presence was. lending weight
to a report of a momentous happening
of which the government had no con
firmation, x.
On the question of whether the
German delegation is empowered to
act without communication from Ber
lin, regardless of what demands are
made in the terms offered by Marshal
Foeli, depends whether an immediate
cessation of hostilities may be in
sight.
Marshal Foch is fully empowered to
act for the entente allies and America
for the supreme war council at Ver
sailles already has laid down the
terms and no changes are to be tol
erated. It has been assumed, based
on the usual' practice of negotiations
in agreeing upon an armistice, that
the Germans' also are fully empowered
to sign for their government.
It is regarded ' as possible that
since the German delegates did not
know the terms of the armistice until
they met Marshal Foch they might
have planned to await at least a per
functory word from , Berlin before
closing the negotiations. With mili
tary' telegrams and wireless at their
disposal- little time would be con
sumed in this reference.
There is reason to believe that in a'
despairing hope ' of retaining . some
shadow of control over the : future
government of Germany, no matter
what form that may take, the kaiser
and the military leaders will Insist
that the reichstag, representing, tbe
German people, assume full share of
responsibility for the humiliating
armistice and peace terms which must
be -accepted. For this ' reason the
official .view here is that the armis
tice commissioners would go through
with the form of communicating with
their government
The inclusion of General Winter
feldt and other members of the Prus
sian military class among the German
envoys attracted attention here.. ..
General Winterfeldt was a military
attache for Germany at Paris before
the war. It was recalled today in
September, 1913, he was severely in
jured in an automobile accident at
Griselles.
GERMANS SEND WIRELESS

jy today over the unfounded report
that Germany had agreed to armistice
teims which meant unconditional sur
render. The celebration seemed a
combination of Fourth of July, elec
tion night. New Year's eve,' Thanks
giving day and Christmas.
The excitement which seized the
city's millions at the word "peace"
was picturesque and ear-splitting, but
as realization grew that it was- pre
mature, its tragic side came forward.
Not all the celebrators had joined
in the hilarious flag-waving, horn
blowing, impromptu parades. Thou
sands of fathers, mothers,' wives and
sisters went into every church with
open doors to offer prayers of grati
tude because tbey. thought the light
ing had ceased.
These were some of the results of
the "peace" report:
Police Commissioner Enright or
dere the city's giant sirens to sound
the tidings and al the other whistles
and bells in the city followed suit.
Mayor Hylan ordered all city offices
closed for the day and issued a proc-

"the end of the world war," but later
directed that the pageant be post
poned until it is known that the war
is over.
- Thousands of offices, business
places and factories suspended opera
tions so their employes could make
merry.
f toek exchanges closed at 2:30 p.
m. and Wall street son was deserted.
Every person in New York not
lame, halt, blind, sick or in jail, joined
in the demonstration. Schools were
dismissed early and children paraded.
Vehicle traffic in the principal thor
oughfares was suspended because
motars and wagons could not force a
path through the densely packed mul
titudes. ,.
Hours aftrr,the report fo an annls-1
tiee had bean officially denied the
citj was a bedlam. It seemed New
toraers were much more eager to
credit reports of peace than believe I
the war not yet over.

For years dentists have been
telling us that its acid mouth that
ruins the teeth, yet this acid that is
powerful enough to eat through the
harder than bone enamel of the
teeth and decay them, is tasteless.
It's presence can be detected only
by chemical tests.
No chemical test is needed to
tell you that you have acidstom
ach. Indigestion, belching, heartburn,
sour stomach, food-repealing, that
miserable puffed up feeling after
eating, intestinal pains, headaches,
etc. These are all Nature's warn
ings to you. They are sure signs
of superacidity.
Acid stomach prevents proper
digestion and assimilation, thus
causing the blood to become thin
and impoverished as a result of
which people become sallow-skinned,
emaciated, sick and bad look
ing. .
Acid-stomach rauses stomach
and intestinal fermentation, pro
during poisons and toxins which,
absorbed into the blood and car
ried throughout the system, causn
auto-intoxication. Insomnia, nerv
ousness, irritability, mental depres
sion, melancholia, dizziness, verti
go and oftentimes, valvular heart
trouble and heart failure.
Acid-stomach causes irritation
all alcng the intestinal tract irri
tation so severe and aggravating as
to frequently result in catarrh and
even cancer of the stomach.

cess if this acid-stomach is allowed
to tear down and use up day after

will at once hand you back your
50c.

Young Elizabethans
"Young Elizabethans whose early sing
ing was stilled by the war." This is the
title of a lecture being delivered in this
country by a young English-soldier'poet,
and it is a most true and touching title.
Alas, for these eager souls, these dreamers
with heart of flame who have left the class
ic shades of Oxford and the English lanes
and cricket fields and hearths to go and
die in the sodden ditches before Ypres and
in the famous meadows before Cambrai.
It is estimated that at least a dozen Eng
lish and Australian and Canadian poets of
more than passing worth and promise have
died already in the great war. "Elizabeth
an Singers," these, in all that that immortal
term implies. Who knows what swelling
notes, what deathless chants ' might have
been seme day sung by the young song
bird whose throat was slit by German
steel, somewhere along the Somme. Joyce
Kilmer showed wondrous promise, and so
did Sassocn. Our own Allan Seeger
wrote in his youth a poem or two that will
never die. But few men are given to write
anything worth while before their forties.
Kipling was the one exception of this age,
just as William Cullen Bryant and Poe
were of the age just behind us. It will
never be known how many and how great
poems were stilled by war before they
were born' in the souls .of these singers
slain.
BRITAIN'S GREAT CONTRIBUTION
(From the Kansas City Star.)
Turkey's surrender is a British victory
which all the nations allied against the Cen
tral powers will acclaim with the greater
heartiness and joy because the opening of
the war against the Turk was attained by
military and naval disaster.
British courage and British persever
ence were undaunted by the failure at
Gallipoli, which in addition to being a sore
setback to the empire's arms was rather
too spectacular to leave any comfort to its
pride. The attack on the straits was under
the eye of the entire world, the repulse was
complete and. seemed to be final. When
the fleet sailed away the apparent verdict
was that Germany's fabric of a Mittel Eu
ropa was real, had proved its solidarity and
that the theaters of the war were again con
fined to the fronts in being. But Britain
did not accept that verdict. Not for a mo
ment did the empire abandon its purpose of
breaking the threatening spearhead that
Turkey's adhesion to the Teutonic alliance
had directed against India.
The frontal attack had failed, but Tur
key's long flank in Asia Minor, although
far more difficult of access and a move"
ment against which involved enormous
tasks of transport and communication, lay
open. That forbidding road that Napoleon
had failed to penetrate Britain set itself to
follow, and across the baking sand of
Syria and the waterless tracts of Arabia its
indomitable armies toiled and fought, not
as on the European fronts under the en
couraging notice of the world, but unseen
of friendly eyes and for long periods of
a time almost unheard of.
General Townshend's campaign which
at first held out strong hope of a juncture
with the Russian army, operating down
ward from the Caucasus terminated un
successfully at Kut, but Allenby's forces,
operating across Palestine and the expedi
tion to Mesopotamia slowly repaired this
disaster and everywhere forced Turkey's
boundaries back. It was this great flank
attack, almost unparalleled in war, before
which Turkey fell. Allenby's progress had
reached a point that, when Bulgaria's sur
render released the Allied army in Mace
donia, placed Turkey within a vise. With
victorious armies at her front and rear, in
Europe and in Asia, cut off from her allies

and facing certain defeat there was nothing
for her to do but surrender to the energy,
the persistence, the unyielding determina
tion of a foe that never quits, whom no
disaster can discourage and who never
fights better than after a reverse.
The Turkish bag is Britain's almost ex"
clusively and if this were her sole contribu
tion to the final victory the debt her allies
would owe her for it would be almost be
yond estimate. Turkey was the
bridge over which Germany expected to
march to the conquest of Asia. Britain
destroyed that bridge and thereby definite
ly shattered the grandiose project of Mittel
Europa with its threat to all Western na
tions and its certain menace to future world
peace. Well done, Britain!
TO FACE THE TRUTH
(From North American Review.)
It is abundantly clear today that the dis
inclination of the world to face the truth
is mainly answerable for this war which
has brought us to the brink where we look
into a frightful abyss. A mad nation, had
before all men in book and lecture and de"
generate revelry registered its arrogant
purpose to rule or ruin the world. It
seemed the easier course to disregard the '
warning.
Even after the rude awakening of our al
lies we slept on comforted with an elusive
dream of peace through a compromise with
barbaric greed and crime, when our dreams
should have been nightmares, though if we
are to apportion the responsibility for this
error, a heavier burden will rest upon
France and England than upon ourselves.
For they, far better than we, could see the
blackening war cloud and hear the mutter
ings of the disastrous storm which was so
soon to burst upon the world.. France,
whose frontiers touched the frontiers of
Germany, though alive for years to the
menace of its aggression, was for the mo
ment lulled into the almost fatal diversion
cf staging the farce and burlesque of the
Caillaux trial" before a wondering world.
England turned a deaf ear to Lord Roberts,
as he pleaded in vain for his country, by
the addition of a few hundred thousand
men to her expeditionary forces, to make
ready against the evil day to come "the
Day" of the brutal toast, when German
world dominion in all its terror was to rise
on the ruins of the British Empire. His
beseechings were but "devilish speeches"
and his "scheme" was "more than anything
else a plot for the destruction of Liberal
ism and for the abolition of civil freedom."
The hero who had added so much glory
to English arms was covered with obloquy
in the court of public opinion and was
threatened with the ignomy of a cancella
tion of his pension. All the civilized peo
ples of the world, deaf to the voice of truth
in varying degrees, were guilty of an aw"
ful error.

ernment ought to take over the entire sup

United Press Pulls Greatest
Fake Beat of 'the Age and
Arouses Entire Nation to
Ill-Timed Enthusiasm
(By Review Leasee Wlrej
NEW YORK, Nov. 7. False re
ports that Germany had acecpted the
terms of the armistice and that fight
ing had ended threw the country In a
delirium today and turned out to be
the greatest hoax of recent years.
Official assurances that the report
was false failed to check the almost
liotous demonstrations which swept
over many American cities and mil
lions of Americans will, not know how
they were fooled until they read the
morning papers.
A dispatch cabled from France to
the United Press and picked up and
circulated through the country by an
other news agency declared the armis
tice signed at 11 oclock this morning
and fighting ended at 2 o'clock this
afternoon.
None of these unfounded reports, of
course, was received or distributed by
the Associated Press, which, on the
contrary, was able by investigation
conducted through official channels to
establish that the story was a hoax.
Offlciaf dispatches from France to
the state department at Washington
testify that the German commission
ers were not even to meet Marshal
Foch until 5 o'clock this afternoon
and dispatches received tonight from
the American army on the Sedan
front show that at 6:30 p. m. the
troops were advancing.
After cabling to France and receiv
ing an official reply. Secretary Lan
sing from the state department In
Washington issued this statement:
"The report that the armistice with
Germany had been signed Is hot true.
When it reached the department of
state this morning an inquiry was at
once dispatched to Paris. At 2:04
o'clock this afternoon a telegram in
reply to that of the department was
received from Paris. It stated that
the armistice had not yet been signed
and that the German representatives
would not met Marshal Foch until 5
p. m., Paris time, or 12 noon, Wash
ington time."
The false report was not easily
overtaken by the truth and as it
spread through the country it gath
ered momentum until demonstrations
approaching hysteria ruled in many
cities. Business was suspended,
schools were closed, bells were rung,
whistles shrieked, prayers were of
fered in churches, parading citizens
jammed the streets and the scenes
usually attendant on New Year's eve
and election night were intensified.
The New York stock exchange as
well as the curb market, were closed
at 2:30 p. m., after a hurried meeting
of the governors. A market which at
first appeared to be unresponsive
suddenly developed activity which
shot up some of. the so-called peace
stocks from 2 to 12 points. Ex
changes in other cities were similarly
affected. 1
Here follows a copy of the cable
gram received by the United Press a?
its New York office:
"Unipress, New York:
"Paris: Armistice allies signed 11
morning; hostilities cease 2 afternoon.
Sedan taken morning by Americans.
(Signed) "HOWARD.
"Simms."
(Unipress cable code address for
United Press;' Howard is Roy W. How
ard, president of the United Press,
and Simms is William Philip Simms,
Paris correspondent of the United
Press.)
To grasp the situation it should be
borne in mind that Paris, being to the
east of the United States is about
six hours ahead of New York time.
Although it had been announced that
the armistice was signed at 11
o'clock and that fighting had ceased
at 2 o'clock, it was a fact that the
Gorman commissioners were not to
be received by Marshal Foch until 5
o'clock three hours after the hour re
ported as the end of the fighting.
The state department's cable of in
quiry to France was not dispatched
until after the reports had been called
to the department's attention and
when a reply came, saying the armis
tice had not been signed and the fight
ing had not ceased more time had
elapsed.
At 3:35 o'clock In Paris it was offi
cially announced that four German
officers bearing a white flag prob
ably would arrive at Marshal Foch's
headquarters some time tonight. That
announcement was one hour and
thirty-five minutes after the hour re
ported as the end of the fighting and
Associated Press dispatches filed with
the American army on the Sedan front
at 6:30 oclock tonight showed that
an hour and a half after the German
commissioners had been expected the
troops still were fighting their way
forward. This dispatch said clearly
that the American army was consoli
dating its positions and preparing for
a further advance.
Then it was 6::iu o'clock tonight in
London the foreign office pronounced
unfounded the rumor that the armis
tice had been signed and at that ho.ir
no word had been received In the
British capital that the German dele
gation had crossed the French lines.
It should be borne in mind that it
was then four hours and a half after
the hour reported as set lor the ces
sation of hostilities and more than,
seven hours alter the hour reported
as the signing of the armistice. Gov
ernment teleuiapli lilies coilucct Lou

( MiiMmm t w
!. 'w'fcii'M flit 'ksSS ii " s
far from the place fixed for the meet
ing of German commissioners with
Marshal Foch, and London, therefore,
is certain to receive prompt reports
when a truce is arranged.
Tonight as the clocks in France
were turning toward midnight there
still was no word that the German
commissioners had appeared at Mar
shal Foch's headquarters and much
less affixed their signatures to an
armistice.
The hoax recalled to the public
mind others which had fooled the
country if not . the world. One was
the alleged discovery of human oe
ings on the moon and the other was
Dr. Cook's olaim of discovery of the
north pole. A news hoax, however,
more closely paralleling today's wa,?
the one perpetrated on the country at
the death of Pope Pius X. It was an
nounced by the United Press some
hours before it occurred, but as the
dispatch did not specify the hour and
minute a great achievement in giving
the news to the world was claimed.
In the present instance, however,
there will be abundant official evi
dence to guide the public. The armis
tice, being a historic -document, will
bear the hour and minute at which the
signatures are set upon it, and the
hour at which hostilities are to end
likewise will be officially recorded
and announced to the world.
No one, of course, can say with cer
tanty when the armistice witt be
signed or when the fighting will
stop. Official proof, however, and
the hours rolling steadily onward are
ample evidence that it was not signed
at 11 o'clock this morning and that
the fighting did not stop at 2 o'clock
this afternoon.
Moreover it never Las been expect
ed that the terms of armstice on the
western front might le accepted at
one brief meeting. Many questions
are involved now which were not in
volved when armistices were granted
to Austria. Bulgaria and Turkey. One
of the principal point concerns the
disposition of the German fl.-et, so
vital to England. Now that ths fleet
is in the hands of the revolutionists,
it is not improbable that the German
plenipotentiaries may not at once be
enabled to give the assurances the
allies will demand. It should be re
called in connection with this point
that Great Britain insisted on having
one of her admirals present with Mar
shal Foch at the meeting with the
commissioners and that Germany
sent Admiral Von Hlntze.
So far as is known tonight the
erroneous report was published in
only two cities in Kurope in Ixmdon
and in Brest, France. The London
newspaper later withdrew its edition
and printed a retraction. The publi
cation in Brest was by a newspaper
which received the report from the
United Press.
A question being asked tonight by
many is why the naval censors passed
the dispatch for publication If It was
not true. The answer is that censors
do not pass upon the trujh or falsity
of dispatches; they are only concerned
with whether they contain Informa
tion likely to be of value to an enemy,
or damaging to the entente military
forces.

in a statement tonight that the offi

termine "the relative strength of the
two parties in the house." He added
that tin re was little reason to doubt
that the "democratic control of sen
ate will remain unrhanged."
"We sJiall he obliged," said the
statement, "to await the official re
turns to determine the relative
strength of the two parties in the
house. The result in the senate seems
to depend upon final returns from
Michigan and New Mexico. There is
little reason to doubt that the demo
cratic control of the senate will re
main unchanged. The result through
out the country is so close that it
may fairly be said that the elections
constitute a drawn battle between the
two parties."

BY REVIEW
NEW YORK, Nov. 7. Wall street
experienced one of the wildest and
moat bewildering sessions in its
ariej experience today, the stock
market responding feverishly to un
confirmed reports of t'je signing of
tho peaca armistice with Germany.
Tiie liiiancial community accepted
these reports and gave itself over to
a delieium of bullish enthusiasm.
Practically all the leading stock
issues, excepting thoss of the dis
lintive war group made extreme ad
vances langiiig trom 2 to 13 points,
the rise being largely retained at the
very active close.
Stocks opened at gains of 1 to 3
points, cables from neutral points
telling of revolts and mutinies in the
German army and navy inviting
further extension of long accounts.
Rails and oils were among the first
shares to make strong response, hih
class transportations mounting to the
year's best prices at gross gains of
to 7 poiuis. Mexican Petroleum
rose almost 13 points and related
shares 2 to 5. Moltys, coppers and
peace specialities fiuisned at net ad
vances of 2 to 4 points. Total sales
amounted to 1,150,000 shares. Rail
way bonds gained 1 to 4 per cent,
arious foreign issues 1 to 2, but
Liberty issues were barely firm.
Total sales, par value, aggregated $16,
300,000. Old United States bonds
were unchanged on call.
GRAIN MARKET.
CHICAGO, Nov. 7. False reports
that Germany had already signed an
armistice brought about a savage
whipsaw market today in the corn
trade. After prices had plunged
downward about 6 cents a bushel, a
violent upturn ensued and the close

sensational advance, and were steady
ing while evideuo) as awaited that
genuine basis existed for current talk
that grain exports would soon be
greatly enlarged. Suddenly a big
selling drive developed, and word
went round that the armistice had
actually been signed. Especially for
small dealers there was no chance to
stop for inquiry, and many holdings
bad to be sacrificed on the rapid de
scent of values. The lack of any con
firmation of the armistice signing
finally became too apparent, thouga,
for even the most radical bears, and
the result was a complete change of
sentiment. As the session came to an
end prices shot straight for the
zenith.
Oats swayed with corn, but within
a narrower range. :
Provisions were relatively inactive

RUSSIANS ASKING
FOR FURTHER AID
(Fy Review Leased Vire)
WASHINGTON, Nov. .7. Further
and immediate aid from the allied and
American governments in ridding Rus
sia of Bolshevik! control and re-estab
lishing order is asked in an appeal ad
dressed to President Wilson by the
consolidated Russian provisional gov
ernment at Omsk and delivered to
Secretary Lansing today by Boris
Bakhmeteff, Russian ambassador to
the United States.
After describing the reign of ter
ror inaugurated in Central Rirnsia by
the Bolsheviki and asserting that con
trol by this element is made possible
only through German influence, the
appeal says aid already extended to
Russia by the allies will be in vain
if "the new help arrives too late." It
adds that every hour of delay, "threat
ens with innumerable calamities Rus
sia, the allies and other nations."
The provisional government ex
pects the aid of the allies and the
United States and "considers itself in
the right to demand insistently upon
such help," says the appeal, which is
signed by Nicholas Avksentieff, presi
dent of the provisional government,
and Peter Vologodsky, premier.

WITH THE FRENCH ARMY IN
FRANCE, Nov. 7,;4:30 p. m.. (By the
Associated Press.) Persistent rain
and deepening mud, although making
communications more difficult do not
appear to have checked pursuit of the
Germans retreating toward the BeV
gian frontier. The advance continued
this morning over the geater part of
the French front with such rapidity it
was impossible to follow it with pre
cision. Latest reports are the French
cavalry is moving toward the Meuse
and the infantry toward Mezieres.
General Debeney's forces also were
close upon the German rear guards
occupying numerous villages and car
rying their advance toward Hirson.
Capture of this important railway cen
ter will bring about final crumbling
of the transportation organization of
the German armies in France.
Subsequent operations may become
a race between the armies in retreat
and those Jn pursuit to Ais Lachappele

ARMISTICE HOAX
Warren District Slows Up to
Discuss Fake News About
Peace and Mine Work Al
most Ceases
The hoax perpetrated by the United
Press on the United States when that
news service declared an armistice
had been signed between the allies
and Germany suspending all hostili
ties, had the effect of causing the
wheels of the mining industry in the
Warren district to pause and almost
cease to move for several hours yes
terday. The result cannot fail to he
evident in the output of the big mines
in this vicinity, which are engaged in
turning out copper at top speed for
the use of the allies. But for the
Associated Press' denial of the re
port, received by The Review, a cele
bration would have been held here,
comparable to those heldy elsewhere.
The miners of the "WarfVn district
true patriots in every, respect, have
been working at top speed for a year
and a half to supply the allies with
copper for munftions and other war
uses anj at the same time provide
commerce with the essential metal. '
When the rumor first was received
here yesterday morning that an armis
tice had been signed, it passed from
person to person, and the whole city
seethed with excitement When an
extra edition of a newspaper wat
Issued carrying this "news" it was
telephoned to every mining shaft in
the district. As the men underground
received the news, according to the
statement of some of them last night,
thoy decidsd amonj themselves that
they would celebrate the occasion by
taking a holiday. The Review's bul
letins came just in time to save the
situation and prove to the men that
their efforts still were needed by the
country.

Mrs. Tobolt Astonished at
Results of Tanlac
Gains 20 Pounds
"Som wonderful things happen in
this world, and the way Tanlac has re
stored health and built me up is one
of them," said Mrs. Paul Tobolt of 916
California avenue, Butte, Mont.. In one
of the most interesting and remark
able statements yet published in con
nection with the Master Medicine.
"My trouble started about two years
ago," she continued, "and I have simp
ly been a nervous wreck ever since
until now. Last January 1 went to the
hospital where I was told that my
whole system had become poisoned by
an affected appendix, that an opera-1
tion was my only hope and it was I
doubtful if this would save me. So I
arranged to have my children cared
for. in case I should not see them
again, and submitted to the operation.
Well, the operation was done with so
much skill, and I was so carefully
nursed that I finally got out of the hos
pital, and was home with my husband
and children again. Then I picked up
wonderfully for a little more than a
month when' I began having terrible
pains in my back over my kidneys.
Jly . appetite left me, and nothing
tasted right. I was constipated, had
fearful headaches, and was so nerv
ous I could hardly sleep. I fell off
until I weighed less than a hundred
pounds and was so weak that it was
an effort for me to get about at all.
Finally my husband suggested that
I try Tanlac, as it was being so much
talked about, and the results have as
tonished us both. I couldn't see much
improvement on my first bottle, but
with the second my appetite got bet
ter. I commenced to feel improved
and was surprised when I got on the
scales, 'to find that I had gone up to
108 pounds. Well, the third bottle did
wonders for me, relieving me. of all
pain and headache and making me
want to eat up everything. . 1 now
weigh 118 pounds making a gain of j
more than 20 pounds on three bottles '
and I'm wondering what my fourth !
bottle which I have just started tak-!
ing, will do for me. I sleep like a 1
healthy child, never waking at night
at night at all and feel like I could I
eat five or six meals a day. I dismiss-!
ed my hired help, four weeks ago, aft-1
er 18 months steady service, and since I
then I have done all my own house-1
work, cooking and everything. I have
no more dull, drowsy had feelings and
life is a pleasure to me. I can't praise :
Tanlac enough for what it has done :
for me."
