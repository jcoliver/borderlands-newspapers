Hun Treaty, Denied Senate,
In Hands o fN. Y. Interests
WASHINGTON .June 3. Senator
Lodge, chairman" of the senate for
eign relations committee, told the
senate today he had seen in the hands
of the business interests in New
York a copy of the treaty with Ger
many, given out by an American rep
resentative at Paris, but withheld by
the state department from the senate.
The first suggestion that the treaty
text was available in New York was
made by Senator Borah, Republican,
of Idaho, when a request was made
by Senator Johnson, Republican of
California, that his resolution asking
the state department rbr the text be
allowed to go over until the woman
suffrage amendment was disposed of
by the senate.
Senator Swanson asked the author
ity for this statement, and It was then
that Senator Lodge announced he had
seen the treaty. Senator Swanson
said an Associated Press dispatch had
tated that President Wilson had
agreed not to make the treaty public
at present and argued that the John
son resolution would amount to a re
quest that the president break his
word. Publication abroad, he said,
was due probably to the fact that
some one else had broken faith.
Senator Swanson urged that the
resolution be referred to the foreign
relations committee. Senator Lodge
said that would da a farJce.
Philadelphia Seat of U. S.
Bomb Plots, Police Discover
PHILADELPHIA, June 3. A twenty-four hour Investigation by agent
of the department of justice and thtl police failed to develop a clue to the
identity of the perpetrators of the bomb outrages here last night when
the rectory of a Catholic church and the home of a private citizen were
badly damaged. Neither was there advanced any tangible reason why
these places were selected for destruction. Several men were arrested
on sutpicion but all were releaad.
Most of those working n the case seemed to agree that one gang was
responsible for the outrages in Philadelphia and seven other cities, the
bomb explosions here last December ana the mailing of the infernal ma
chines in New York In April. It also ha been established with a. fair
degree of definiteness, according to the police, that Philadelphia is the
headquarters of the violent, radical of the east and their emissary who
blew himself to atoms in front of Attorney General Palmer's home in
Washington was sent from this city. t .
There was a gathering here last Sunday of a score of radical agitators
from throughout the east, according to Superintendent of Police Robinson,
but none of them could be found today. One theory Is that final plan for
the widespread bomb explosions were made at this meeting.
The police department today issued warrants for the arrest of per
sons posting red lettered notices of a general strike throughout the city.
The call Is for a "general strike to free all political prisoners" -and It la
the opinion of the police that the agitator aim to inaugurate nee a strike
similar to the one that is sweeping Canada.
SENATE TO ADOPT i'SKSE.

Vote Yesterday
WASIHGNTON, June 3. Final ac
tion in the senate on the bouse reso
lution for submission of the Susan
B. Anthony woman suffrage constitu
tiouai amendment" was breveyed' to
day by debate, principally by suffrage
opponents, and by discussion of the
peace treaty. The resolution was made
unfinished business and it is believed
that before adjournment tomorrow the
last roll call will be reached with adop
tion apparently assured.
When managers of the resolution
which was "adopted by the house two
weeks -ago, 304 to 89, gave up hope
of a vote today, Chairman Watson of
the senate woman suffrage committee
announced that he would Insist upon
holding the senate in session tomor
row until the final vote was reached.
Senator Watson spoke less than a
minute in support of the resolution.
Senator Lenroot, Republican of Wis
consin, also urged its adoption. Sen
ators Reed of Missouri and Underwooit
of Alabama, Democrats, and Borah,
Republican of Idaho, made the princi
pal addresses against the measure.
The senate rejected, 58 to 17, an
amendment by Senator Harrison,
Democrat of Mississippi, limiting ben
efits of the proposed equal franchise
to white citizens, an amendment by
Senator Underwood, left pending when
the senate adjourned, would provide
that popular state conventions instead
of state legislatures should act on the
proposed addition to the constitution.

Senator Swanson said neither the
British nor French parliaments had
been given official copies.
"Because Germany broke faith is
no reason for .the. senate to ask the
president to break faith," said Mr.
Swanson.
"Regardless of any agreement I as
sume that when the president learns
that New York interests have It in
their possession', the president will no
longer feel under obligations to keep
faith," Senator Borah interrupted.
"I think the treaties in New York
did not come from the Germans."
Senator Swanson suggested that the
committee investigate.
"I don't want any investigation,"
said Senator Porah. "Iwant the pres
ident to know that those people in
New York are using it, in a semi-public
way, for their private informa
tion. .
"If the president maie an agree
ment not to give it out, there is no
reason why the president should not
advise us of that fact. If it is a fact.
If it is true that copies have gone
into the hands of special interests, I
think the president would feel reliev-l
ed of his agreement and give us the
treaty."
Senator Johnson Interrupted to
urge that the debate be closed and
the woman suffrage resolution be
passed and the incident was closed.

The following summary of condi

"There are 5000 soldiers at Chihua

there are 8000 men under Gen. Miguel

Santa Rosalia at noon Monday from

Villa's men have retreated to the hills,
just as they left for the hills after

"Between Parral and Jimenez,
where the railroad was destroyed by

XPECT ARREST OF

Head of Pittsburg I. W. W.
Confesses Identity Of
Leader In Plot
PITTSBURGH. June 3. Arrest
of the man who manufactured
th bombs which exploded late last
night near the homes of federal
Judge W. H. S. Thompson and .
W. W. Sibray, chief inspector of v
the bureau of immigration, is Vxi
pected soon by authorities who
are Investigating the outrages.
Police officials said tonlghVthey
had secured the name of the
bomb maker from John Johnson,
head of the I. W. W. organization
at Pittsburgh, who was arrested
today after a fight with officers.
Authorities refused to- disclose
the-name of the bomb maker.
WASHINGTON, June 3. Investiga
tion of the bomb explosions in eight
cities which were intended to kill
public men, has convinced secret serv
ice chiefs here that the outrages had
a common' source, and that they prob
ably can be classed as an unsuccess
ful attempt on the part of a still un-'
known anarchistic group to resume a
campaign of terrorism begun with the
May day attempt to deliver a series of
infernal machines through the mails
out of New York.
Washington police toda'y devoted
their efforts to re-asBembling frag
ments of the man who was killed last
night at the door ,of Attorney General
Palmer's home while attempting to
plant his cargo "of explosives. Mr.
Palmer himself dismissed the incident
today as "utter failure to terrorize the
country and stay the hand of the gov
ernment," which purpose he ascribed
to the authors of the outrages.
Police at New York, Philadelphia,
Pittsburg, Cleveland, Newtonville,
Mass., Boston and Paterson, N. J.,
were engaged in the widespread hunt.
Detectives were sent from Washington
to the first two named cities in order
to connect up operations.
The hat of the Washington bomb
planter, purchased in Philadelphia,
and other details indicated a possibil
ity that the consignment of explosives
had been sent out from there. An
other connecting link, in the view of
authorities here, was the similarity
of the anarchistic handbills found near
the cene of the explosions In sev
eral cities-.'
Government experts on explosives,
after surveying the site of the ex
plosion here, and the partially demol
ished dwelling, came to the conclusion
that two separate bombs exploded,
probably when the man carrying them
tripped over a stone step at the en
trance. -

German Counter Proposal To
Pay Hundred Billion Marks
Total Indemnity Favored
French Only Ones At Peace
Conference Who Object To
Softening of Peace Terms
PARIS, June 3. The ecoflomic dif
ficulties of Germany, as exposed in
her counter proposals are being se
riously considered by the inter-allied
leaders. Acceptance of the German
counter offer of 100,000,000,000 marks
Indemnity and a change in the provis
ions regarding Silesia to give the Ger
mans .certitude of receiving the ne
cessary amounts of coal for east Ger
man industry are, according to re
ports in well informed quarters the
most probable of any changes in the
treaty. ,
These favoring acceptance of the
German offer are found in the British
and American camps, while the
French representatives are inclined
to stand firmly upon the original pro
posal of the total reparation fixed by
mo r-i-uiiuiuic I'UiiuiUH.'MUU.
To Accept Indemnity Offer
The offer of a hundred billion
marks by Germany surprised some
of the entente financial experts who
think that with some concessions aa
to the payment of interests which is
not included in the German proposal,
the otter is perhaps acceptable.
These exports argue that from the
viewpoint ifworld credit arrange
ment it might be better to base the
future of the plans of the entente
governments upon a deiinite sum of
one hundred billion marks voluntari
ly offered than upen an indefinite as
sessment, which the Germans might
accept only under protest.
No attempt has been raade among
the American delegates to disguise
their anxiety over the situation. The
commissioners, however, still hope
that the role of mediators selected by
them will prove guctesstul in the end.

REPARATIONS
TO BE MADE 1
TWO
THE BISBEE DAILY REVIEW, WEDNESDAY, JUNE 4, 4919
street car petition
tabled; attorney
puzzled by meaning
Application and petition of resi
dents of Bisbee received by the cily
council several weeks ago and request
ing that the council order the Warren
Biabea railroad to construct their
street ' car railroad to the western
boundary of the city, was laid on the
table at the meeting of the city coun
cil last night. Star Williams, attor
ney of the district, represented the
petitioners, and Sain H. Kyle, city at
torney, presented an opinion for the
council, . .. -,
In the opinion of Mr. Kyle the street
railway company has fulfilled the
terms of its franchise with the city
la that the tentative agreement or con
tract entered into by the city and the
railway company was made prior to
the extension of the city limits to its
present western boundary. Although
the election granting the franchise
was not held until after the city limits
had been extended, Mr. Kyle held that
the original contract was not altered
and that it cannot now be altered
without the consent ' of the railway
company.
1 Following considerable, discussion
Mr. Williams demanded that the may
or or some member of the council de
fine to him the term "tabled."
"I believe that I understand Eng
lish," he declared, "and tabled to me
means nothing but that it is laid on
the table." t
The attorney referred several times
to a petition signed by more than 1000
citizens, and at the close of the discus
sion declared that if "the wish of
1000 citizens has no influence with
you (the members of the council)
I am determined to take this matter
further and to higher authority.
Mr. Williams argued that in spite
of the reports of the railway com
pany that they have lost money dur
ing periods of the past and that the
desired etxension is not justified at
this time, he believes fhat the com
pany has earned profit through the
. operation of the lines. . During his
argument he made the statement that
all he requested is thatihe city coun
cil require ffte company to fulfill the
terms of their franchise.
"Those terms have been fulfilled,"
declared N. C. Bledsoe, councilman.
"They have not," retorted Williams.
"I have the goods here In my pocket.
I defy anyone to show where they
have been fulfilled."
Mr. Kyle in his report declared that
the terms of the franchise had been
entirely fulfilled, in that the franchise
agreement as reached for. the city
limits as de'i'ned on th -vest prior to
their extension to the present line.
Williams insisted following the vote
to table the motion, in seeking to se
cure from the council an expression
as to whether the petition would be
reconsidered again in the near future,
requesting time and again a definition
of the term tabled. Finally Council
man Bledsoe moved that the council
prooeed with its business. The mo
tion carried, and discussion ended.

WAR IS DECLARED ON
FALSE FIRE ALARMS
The city of Bisbee went on rec
ord officially last night as pro
tectors of the public's peace of
mind and money.
False fire alarms at the rate of
five for the past month have
caused the citizens no end of wor

'i hey have also cost the city sev
eral dollars in hard coin, for each
run of the depart me at means a
certain outlay in money.
Consequently the council decid
ed to assist in putting an end to
false fire alarms. They will pay
the sum of $10 tor any person who
, will secure the arrest and convic

an alarm.

The letter contained a single

COLUMBUS, June 3 Charles E.
Morris, secretary to the governor, who
received the message from Mayor

I Just wanted to sleep all the time, for
that was the only ease I could get, when
I was asleep. I became a nervous wreck
ust from the awful suffering with my
head.
I was so nervous that the least noise
would make me jnmp out of my bed. : I
had no energy, and was unable to do
anything. My son, a young' boy; had to
do all my household duties.
I was not able to do anything until I
took Cardui. I took three bottles in all
arid It surely cured me of those awful
headaches. That has been three years
ago, and I know thecure is permanent,
tor I have never hadfany headache since
taking Cardui.
Nothing relieved me until I took Cardui.

THRILLING MELODRAMA
"THIN ICE," AT THE
EAGLE TODAY ONLY
Shannon Fife provided Corinne
Griffith's latest picture, entitled "Thin
lee," at the Eagle theater today. It
is a melodramatic number deoling wlih
a girl-wife who 13 compromised by
foul means by a bucket-shop operator
and whose efforts to etxricate herself
and her brother from this man's toil9
thai-make the picture powerful Indeed.
The climax. In particular, is well work
ed out, containing, as it does, one sur
prise after another, the while main
taining the suspense at high pitch.
Miss Griffith Is appearing in the
featured role. Again, does she wear
some perfectly exquisite gowns, al
ways making a,stunning appearance.
Henry G. Sells leads the supporting
cast w ith a likable characterization of
the hero, while Jack McLean, as the
weakling brother, and L. Rogers Lyt
ton, as the heavy, are good.
"Thin Ice" is a good melodrama, in
tricate, cleverly evolved and well de
veloped. (Peter Milne in Motion Pic

Earning Power
Put your money to work for you where it, will be as safe as in a SAVING- BANK with a hundred per cent greater
earning power. Refining is the sound, substantial manufacturing end of the oil business where never a dollar is
lost. And it offers the most PROFITABLE investment you can find anywhere, in or out of the oil industry.
1 1
A Gambling Eliminated
There no gueis work to oil refining. We know from actual test and
experience what we can make from the Texas crude oil ; the same as
the miller can-weigh your wheat, or corn, and tell you how much
flour, meal and bran you will get, and give you the value of it. There
is no gamble or specula'tion in the matter. Oil and oil products are
as staple as wheat and corn, the price is as well established -the mar
ket is world-wide the consumption is greatly in excess of the sup
ply the law of supply and demand assures ever increasing profits
from the manufacture of refined petroleum products.
The only essential to remarkable success ie an ample supply of cride oil and proper
management. The Panther City Oil &. Refining Co. possesses those elements to a
degree that bespeaks a brilliant future. Note on the map that two of tne pipe lines
that lead into Fort Worth from the Great Ranger and Burkburn.ett fields cross our 51
acre refinery site, on which our plant, of 1000 barrels initial capacity, wilt be erected.
Read the letter reproduced herewith it speaks for itself. We are going to BUY, from
the producer our supply of crude oil and REFINE it, taking the BIG and SURE profits.
The production company, after taking all the risks of getting oil, sells his output for
$2.25 per barrel...-The refinery converts this iame oil into refined'.Petroleum products
t a net profit of $5 per barrel. There is more money: in refining a barrel of oil ihan
in producing it and there is never a dollar lost in the refining end.

Teeth
An animal with 2500 teeth the duck-billed dinosaur, lived in Wy
oming eight million years ago, stood 45 feet nigh and.lo'oked like-a ,
kangaroo. See his petrified skeleton in the American Museum of Nat
ural History next time you, visit New York. He will have more visitors '
after Froadway is dry. .
A scientist, addressing an assemblage of- Jong-haired men and short
haired 'women selects the duck-billed dinosaur as his text. HJcints
out that as man becomes more civilized, he has fewer teeth. Bventually
he will lose them all. This" generation finds its-jaws, tod short not
enough room for the wisdom teeth. Remember when you cut yours?
Cracker-barrel philosophers of small towns used to talk about dig
ging graves with out teeth. Either by eating too much or neglecting
the masticators. Rheumatism, tuberculosis, bad blood, stomach disor
ders, even insanity frequently caused by unclean teeth.
The English marveled at our doughboys shining ivories. Tooth
brushes are responsible for that have much to do with the difference .
between ruddy-cheeked Yanks and sickly cockneys of the London slums.
"Born within the Chimes" and without prophylaxis.
Teach your children to keep their teeth clean. Tell them it will
mean less castor oil.Tnore happy play, fewer visits of doctors with bitter
medicine. Dental experts examining school children say 59 per cent of
them have diseased teeth and gums, the common cause of "growing
pains."' Small wonder the bright lad is the exception.
The toothbrush habit is recent. Even as late as 1754 the polished
.Lord Chesterfield had never heard of one. The fine gentlemen of those
days wore wigs and oiled their hair, but had to fumigate their mouths
with arquebusade water. . Like the period before bath tubs and running
water, when the French perfected perfumes. They had to to get near
each other.
Why do Americans have the best teeth in the world? Why did the.
dandified kaiser insist on an American dentist? The Indians taught us.
Dr. Marshall H. Seville of Columbia University digs Into ruins, dis
covers: Long hefore Columbus was born, even 1500 year3 ago, the
Aztecs had perfected dentistry to an art. They filled cavities, mafle
crowns and bridge work. Aztec dudes had conspicuous holes in their
teeth filled with inlays 'of gold or turquoises as perfect-fitting a job
as you could get today. They left records showing that they even used
coca, from which cocaine is extracted, as a local anaesthetic.
Many centuries later, in 1796, it was an event of much comment when
Josiah Flagg, advertised: "Transplants both live and dead Teeth, sews
up Hare Lips, Extracts stumps. Lines and plumbs Teeth with virgin
gold. Foil or Lead. Fixes gold roofs and Palates and artificial Teeth,
greatly assisting the pronunciation and the swallow. Also Chew-sticks,
which are to be sold' both wholesale and retail", that they may be more ex
tensively used. Dr. Flagg has a method to furnish those 'Ladies and
Gentlemen or Children with artificial Teeth, Gold Gums, Roofs or Pal
ates, that are at a distance and cannot attend personally."
You Can't Grin at God and Get Away With It
There was a time when the whole earth was "of one language and
one speech."
There were no "foreigners' no "cjptlanders." .
And to most of us this would seem like an ideal condition.
Put these "natives" must have gotten "heady" they were going to
show the Lord that they could make a name for themselves and that
they'd never be scattered abroad "uponthe fact of the whole earth."
And so they started to build a tower, whose top was to ''reach unto
heaven" when, probably, they thought they could grin at God and defy
him. "
And to save them, God "confounded their language," so that they
couldn't understand one another's speech and they Btopped building
their city, and it was called "Babel" confusion.
, And the people became scattered their tight little organization was
defeated.
Babel, Babylon or Berlin no matter what the city or its place in
Jtime or history cannot defy God and get away with it.
Confusion always follows. There's a law for nations as there is
for Individuals, that prosperity comes permanently phly as the decrees
of God are fulfilled. '
' No league whether of nations or of individuals that laughs at
the Almighty can prosper. " , .,
.. And this is a good time to remember it, when groups of men and of
nations are attempting to build powers, "making a name unto them
selves" they are simply preparing for 'themselves confusion of tongues
and scattered resources. " ' '
A premier's lot is hard. He must convince his own people that the
peace terms wtll ruin Germany, and -must convince Germany that they
really won't hurt her.
When Count von Brockdorff-Rantzau writes a note about the peace
terms, he tells how utterly they will smash the fatherland. Does he"
consider that an argument against, the terms?
The shipping board favors privae ownership of the merchant fleet
under federal control. That's fair enough. All other private property
is under federal control.
' Congressman Kahn predicts that the American people will receive
a great many surprises when they jitudy the peace treaty carefully. Our
guess is that the American people won't cen read it, much less study it.
President Ador declares that Switzerland can enter the league with
a proud and erect head. No doubt. But tan she hold the pose after she
gets In? ...
We have a large, overgrown hunch that the German people will in
sist that the government sign or resign.
'Senator Sherman thinks it treason to try to understand Wilson. At
pny rate a few of those who are treasonable do understand hini.
Wc are glad to hear that the Finns, and Esthoniaus are about to
clean up the Bolsucviki. but we wonder how much of Russia they have
been promised for the job. And how much of China.
Merman Kohlsaat of Chicago suggests that the Senate "interpret"
the league articles. Wby not? It's a cinch that each nation strong
enough to get by will do Its own interpreting, anyway.
Wo fought to make the world safe for democracy, and Japan kept
China out as long as possible because she feared the "moral awakening
ofjfyur ;bmlrd million poople." next door. " . ,

DOUGLAS, Juae 3 The annual
meeting of the stockholders of the
Douglas Country club was held last
evening at the club house and was
well attended by members interested
in the election to fill three vacancies
in the board of directors, caused by
the expiration of their terms of office,
and the transaction of other business
of importance to the club. The polls
were open from 8 o'clock until 9 and
a count of the votes showed the elec

and H. M. Gallagher to hold office for
three years. The last two succeed
Robert Rae, who has been president of
the club, and E. C. Robinson, who has
ably served as chairman of the golf
committee.
The secretary's report of the con
dition of the club showed an astonish
ing growth in membership since the
signing of the armistice, and particu

the retiring . president and his mem:
bership committee during this. time.

STOCKS AND BONDS .
NEW YORK, June 3. The specu-
lative fabric which professional In-
terests have for weeks been weaving
on the stock exchange was virtually
torn to shreds today in a session
which bordered on semi-demoraliza-
tion at the close and during which
more than 2,000,000 shares changed
hands.
Opening irregular, the market re
lapsed to the extent of 5' to 6 points
in certain issues as the result of active
realizing, professional selling and ap
prehension as to the money outlook. I
The downward' movment was substan-1
tially checked through the aggressive
operations of strong pools. On the
rebound there were recoveries rang
ing up to 10 points in various special
ties. Standard rails were under rath-;
er constant pressure throughout the
session.
Later the money situation became
the dominant, factor, call loan rising I
to 11 per cent, which Drougnt a ae-
luge of stock on the market both for
the long and short account under
which prices gave way In precipitate'
fashion. Foremost in the slump were

American International corporation,
United States Alcohol, Atlantic Gulf
and West Indies and General Motors.
United States Steel broke from 109
