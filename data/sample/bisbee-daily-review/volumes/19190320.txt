MILLIONS OF DOLLARS
WORTH OF RAILROAD
WORK IS POSTPONED
Curtailment of Expenses to
Hold Up Many Planned
Improvements
(Hv Review Leasd Wire)
WASHINGTON, March 19. Instruc
tions issued today by the railroad ad
ministration will result in the tempo
rary suspension or postponement ol
.millions of dollars, of railroad improve
ment -work, because of the financial
predicament caused by failure "ot con
gress to pass appropriations for the
administrations revolving fund. The
suspension ot work applies to many
new stations, under erection or plan
ned, spur tracks, road bed improve
ment?, elevated tracks and construc
tion of bridges and buildings.
, Railroad administration officials
said comparatively few men would be
thrown out of work but admitted that
the railroad improvement program,
planned for this year partly as a
means of employing large numbers of
laborers during the readjustment per
iod, probably would not be carried
out. The program railed for the ex
penditure of more than a half billion
dollars for additions and betterments
alone.
Approval Withheld
The orders specified, that if corpor
ate officers of railroad companies
withdraw or withhold approval of any
improvement project for financial rea
sons or otherwise, the proposals are
to be sent to the railroad adminis
tration for further review. .Railroad
officers here today said that approval
had been or would be withheld for
hundreds of improvement projects.
In cass wjre this approval is not
given, procedure Is to be as follows:
"Work not sjitfd3liall not be com
menced without Jtjirther approval by
the division offciidil expenditures.
As to projects already started and ac
tually under way, please see that no
further work ifirtipne except when
necessary to ensure" safety; where the
project is so fao?WOPlted that to stop
work would be more expensive than
to continue it, and where a job is cov
ered by bona fide contract and stop
ping the work would seriously demor
alize conditions, especially as to
working forces."
Action Follows Conference
The action was taken following a
conference of railroad administration
.officials with the railway executives I
advisory committee, of which Howard
illictt is acting chairman. The
order to regional directors was
i;;ned by T. C. rowell, director of the
division of capital expenditures. !
As a result the entire program for
improvements and additions this year
will be reviewed with a view to cut
ting down expenditures. The budget
for capital expenditures on all rail
roads hist vear calif d for theoutlav
of 1,27,000,000, of which only $573,-1
000,000 was spent, leaving $705,000,-1

PEACE COMMISSION
BELIEVES LEAGUE IS
: MONROE DOCTRINE AID
Did Not Lose Sight of Amer
ica's Sacred Covenant, but
Accepted View League Will
Assure Security of West
N. E. A. Special to The Review
PARIS, France.
The American Peace Commission
did cot lose sight of the Monroe doc
trine in working cut the League of Na
tions conventions. '
It is firmly held that the princi
ple of the Monroe doctrine will be
strengthened rather than superseded
by the League of Nations.-
The Monroe doctrine prohibits all
outside powers from taking possession
of any part of the western - hemisphere.-
' .
Whatever the formalities, it is held,
the practical effect of the League of
Nations will also be to ensure the se
curity and stability of the western
hemisphere as well as the rest of the
world.
It is pointed out that the moment a
foreign power lands the first soldier
on the territory of any other power,
there will be war. The act itself will
amount under" the League of Nations
to a declaration of war, involving dis
cipline of the offending nation by the
league.
The actions of the league of nations
toward internal ' troubles in small or
backward states, is something that
is frequently debated, and will of
course depend on the wording of the
final conventions.
The league, it is conceded, might
have an effect on what has. in later
years come to be regarded' as a re
sponsibility of the United States under
the Monroe doctrine, namely, polic
ing or preventing disorder where nec
essary in America.
In other words, if revolutions and
counter revolutions in Mexico should
become serious enough to be regarded
as international in scope," would the
league of nations have to. O. . K. an
expedition to restore order by Amer
ica? Or cbuld the league designate
any other country than the United
States to restore order? In short,
would the league ever interfere in in
ternal troubles, or would the league
permit interference or any kind, by
any nation? ...
This is one of the important sub
jects upon which sentiment in America
will probably make itself felt before
a final agreement is reached.
It vitally affects America's future
foreign policy as does the question of
whether America will be willing to
take on a mandatory over-Armenia or
some other secticon of the near east
where American guardianship is desired-
by the people themselves and
therefore by powerful allied circles, i

Review Carrier Boys Will
Own Paper Routes and
BecomeBusiness Managers
Commencing April 1. newspapjr carriers of The. Review will be
come sole owner of their routes. - In other words, each boy carrying
papers will become a business man, owning his route and subscribers
on it, and responsible to himself for the number of subscribers he has
and the service he gives the subscribers.
The plan is not new. It has been tried out before and has proved
successful. It gives the bojf something to work for, adds to W initia
tive and offers him practical business experience at an age when he
needs it
The plan is simply this: Each boy owns one route or district.
He buys his papers under contract from The Review, makes his own
deliveries and collections, nd attends all soliciting on Ms route. He
collects from his customers 25 cents each week in advance. The dif
ference between what he collects and what he pays The Review tor
papers, is his net income or profit. Incidentally, he will make more
money than formerly.
To assure the success of this plan The Review respectfully re
vests th co-operation of aM subscribers. In inaugwraitng the new
pia" it is the desire of The Rev.ew lo g.ve the carriers as clean a
shcel 3i possible. For this reason, each patron of The Review is
requested to call at the office and pay op back subscription accoun-.
to April i.
After April 1. subscribers will be requested to pay the carriers
when the boys make regular weekly collection trips. If, however, any
patron prefers for good reason to make payment at the business office.
The Review will accept the payment, crediting route boy as such pay
merits are made.
Patrons of The Review will fmj that under the new plan, deliver
ies and service will improve. The success of his business will be "up
to"' each route carrier. Your co-operation is requested to encourage
and assist the boys who are just launching their new businesses.

HERE IS RESOLUTION
DEMANDING SENATOR
REED'S RESIGNATION
'Preamble Accuses Solon of
Sneering at President
in His Speech
(By Review leased TYlre)
JEFFERSON CITY. lo.. March.19
The - preamble to the resolutions de
manding Senator Reed's resignation
discusses the conditions under which
Senator- Reed was invited to address
the legislature and state that 'much
to the surprise, the discomfort and the
disapproval of the democratic repre
sentatives," Senator Reed referred to
President Wilson in "a most sneering,
sarcastic - and disrespectful manner"
and that by hi a utterances plainly indi
cated It is his opinion that President
Wilson "In his advocacy of the league
of nations was encouraging and advo
cating the adoption of an English
policy to the detriment of the United
States and that the statesmanship of
American patriots and American lead
ers was second to that of the states
men of Great Britain."
Speech Called Insult
"It is charged that Senator Reed's
address was an attempt "to belittle
and belie" the leadership of the demo
cratic party and its accomplishment
in the last six years and was an ef
fort on his part "to bring dissensrou
and Btrife" into the ranks of the party,
and that the speech was "a direct in
sult to the party and the people who
bad given him his political prestige
and made it possible for him to ac
quire any degree of prominence as a
democrat and a statesman."
These resolutions were then
adopted:
Kesoivea, jy ine aemocrais oi iub
house of representatives in confer-1
ence, that we do hereby denounce the I
distinguished senator aanot entitled
to claim any title or standing as a
democrat, In. the democratic party
from Missouri, and suggest to him
that it be is so confirmed in his opin
ions, that the democracy of Missouri,
as well as the people thereof, are not
advised and have no convictions upon
the subject of the league of nations
an nnt n harmnnv with the lead-
.v,n rt Tr-ocirlont Wilirm that he!
CIDUly A .....-... " , .
resivn his position as senator and-J
again Bubmit himseir as a candidate
for the high position which he now
occupies , to the entire dissatisfaction
of the party which nominated and
elected him, and again submit himself
as a candidate to fill the vacancy
which would be occasioned by his
resignation, and be it further
Praise Wilson
"Resolved, That we deplore the fact
that Missouri should have had in the
senate of the United States a mem
ber thereof who has so consistently
and persistently for the two years,
prompted as we believe, feelings of
personal hate and Jealousy, attempted
m thwart the nurooses of President
Wilson not only in matters of peace j
but in matters of war when individual
opinion and individual pride should
have been surrendered to the express
will of the majority so that unity
could have prevailed; and be It further
'Resolved, That w again express
our confidence In the congress, pa
triotism and wisdom of our president,
Woodrow WllBon. and express the in
tention of following in the settlement
and adjustment of all questions grow
ing out of the recent war until we
are convinced by the judgment of fair
er minded men, prompted by higher
niotives and cleaner purposes than the
Honorable Jamea A. Reed, that the
president of the United States la
wrong and that his policy should no
longer be pursued and that he should
no longer be followed."
The resolutions were presented to
the conference by Representative
Frank H. Farris of Phelps county, one
of the 1 democratic members of the
house who withdrew from the cham
ber yesterday afternoon while Senator
Reed was speaking.

JAPANESE ANTI-U. S.
PLOT IN SIBERIA
(Continued from Page One)
time to time, and strict observance of
them by the American commander has j
aioused some of the hostility. i
Much of the hostility in Vladivostok
toward Americans is attributed in well j
informed circles here to the activity
of Japanese agents. It has been re-1
ported that about three weeks ago a
Japanese publicity agent arrived in
Vladivostok. Within a few days, these
reports say, articles began appearing
:n the - nawspapers ot viaaivosioK
whicb are said to be under aJpanese
influence, reflecting upon the United
States and its Siberian policy.
Situation Clearing
State department officials said to
day that the situation as regards Jap
anese influence was clearing. The
ar party in Japan to which much ot
ihe friction was attributed in reports
regarding this country has been ser
seded by the peace party.
Other reports attributing the hostile
teeling toward Americans to Japanese
uilluence asserted that while at the
outset of the Siberian operations,
Japan and the United States each
agree to send 7000 troops to Vladivos
tok. Japan sent 72.000. The willing
ness of the peace party in Japan to co
operate has been shown according to
these reports, by the decision of the
party when it went into power recent
ly, to withdraw some of these troops
Deserters Seek Aid
. Disputes of warfare over the Siber
ian factions, each with its appeal fci
allied support, also has been the cause
of the ill feeling, it was said today.
General Graves in accordance with his ,
Instructions, has avoided favoring any
party or faction. These instructions
it was said, at the state department,
embodied the objects for which Amer
ican troops were sent to Vladivostok.
These objects were set forth as solely
to protect military stories in tnai ctiy
and vicinity, to render whatever aid
they could to the Czecho-Slovaks
whose assistance to the allied nations
during the war was fully appreciated
by the United States and to protect
the Siberian railroad.
Deserters and mutineers of the Sem
enoff and Horvath forces have appeal
ed to General Graves for protection, it
was said, while those remaining loyal
to these two generals also had asked
for assistance in handling the situa
tion. General Graves has Intervened
only to Bave unarmed men from
slaughter without provocation.
Imperialists at Heart
It Is fully understood by officials
that General Semenoff and General
Horvath are imperialists at heart and,
it has been pointed out, if the Amer
ican troops gave aid to them the Uni
ted States could fairly be charged with
Mvorins the restoration of the impe
rial form of government for Russia, j
In well-informed circles it also has !
been said that General Knox, com- j
mander of the British forces in Vladi-:
vostok. had not been at all times in
full accord with the attitude of thea
United atates ana uau uijeu uyu
General Graves the advisability ot tak
ing a definite stand for one political
faction in order to aid in the firm es
tablishment of one government in Si
beria. But the policy of the United
States, officials said, has been and is
still, that the Russian people must de
cide as to their own form of govern
ment and that government must be
answerable to the Russians.

Warren District Residents

The local chapter of the Red Cross
is asking for salvage. In fact the
members are thinking in terms of sal
vage for it is important that Bisbee
do its part in thj drive which is being
waged throughout the Pacific division.
Each household is a possible contribu

In every house which could be given
to tUe lied Cross and made a means
of helping someone or bringing in
some needed funds.
The peace which is in sight is no
closing chapter to Red Cross activi
ties. On the contrary it is a stimulant
offering opportunities for service
which have not been developed here
tofore. Seven Red Cross snop3 have
been opened in California since the
signing of the armistice and greater
activity than ever is urged that the
needs may be met speedily and effici
ently. But some people do not know what
is meant by salvage. So here is a
brief list of the things which the Red
Cross counts as salvage and for which
the call is being sent out over this
district, as well as over the entire
Pacific .division. Salvage includes old
books, bric-a-brac, clothing, hats, shoes
for men, women and children, glass
bottles, jars, household furnishings,
jewelry, leather pillow tops, kid
gloves, metals, tinfoil, horseshoes,
rags and rubber. In short, anything
and everything which can be devoted
to greater usefulness or turned into
money will be welcomed by the Reo
Cross.
If you have any salvage and can
not take it to the Red Cross shop
yourself if it be clothing or if it be oth
er salvage if you cannot take it to
Mr. Woods, whose shop next to the B.

INDUSTRIAL BOARD
AND STEEL MEN MEET
TO REDUCE PRICES
Cost of Metal Products to
Be Cut; Gray Leads
Steel Delegation
x (By Review LeasoO Wire
WASHINGTON. March 19. Initial
steps toward bringing about a reduc
tion of prices and stabilization of the
basic commodities -were taken today
at a conference of representatives of
the steel industry with the depart
ment of commerce's recently organ
ized industrial board. The steel men,
headed by E. H. Gary, chairman of the
Iron & Steel Institute, met with the
board, and later held a, separate con
ference. Another meeting with the
board will be held tomorrow.
The attitude of the steel manufac
turers toward, the board's proposals
was not announced.. The board, how
ever, in a statement issued after the
joint conference said that while "an
actual decision on a lowered scale of
prices" had not been reached, "satis
factory progress had been made."
Chairman Peek of the board was
quoted as sayirrg the steel men had
shown an entire willingness to "co
operate in making effective any pro
gram that will hasten. the return to
normal conditions."
It was generally understood that the
.actor of labor costs entered largely
into the discussion by the manufactur
ers of the board's proposals for stabil
ization of the industry and possible re
duction of prices.
The statement issued by the board
follows:
"After meeting with leaders of the
iron and steel industry, representing
approximately 90 per cent of the coun
try's production, the industrial board
announced this' afternoon that satis
factory progress had , been made .but
that a final decision on a lowered
scale of prices would not be reached
until after full consideration of all
phases of the subject."

What a fuss and a flutter and a chatter and a clatter there is when
mother prepares to buy her new spring hat! "What a lot of talk with
sister as to what's what this year; what a lot of running downtown to
look into store windows and what a rustle of papers as the very latest
styles are look up! !
Father looks on with a sort of a cynical grin. He's been all through
this before year after year until it's become as old to him as the story
his partner tells new customers about the Irishman who died and went
to heaven and met various other nationalities there.
But father, like the good scout he is, digs deep into his jeans and
comes across with a good sized bill. It means fewer cigars for daa
especially since the new tax has shot the prices up but he never kicks
about that. .
He simply pats mother on the shoulder and says : "Get a real nice,
pretty hat this year."
And mother smiles a "Yes" and carefully tucks the money away
in her time-worn pocketbook as she and sister fall to in another discussion
of ribbons and bows and other technical matters that make mere males
cough and reach for a newepaper in which to bury their ignorance.
The turmoil over mother's new spring hat generally lasts about a
week. From day to day her taste wavers from a blue sailor to an old
poke bonnet and back to a wide brim, etc. But suddenly there comes a
surprising silence.
Finally she goes to father and says:
-Tm not going to get a new hat this year. I'm going to make over
my old one it's plenty good enough. And I'm going to use the money to
get something for the children!"
. And rf atner smiles a little cynically he's been through this same
thing year after year, you know and then he pats mother affectionately
on the shoulder and says: "What AGAIN, my dear?"
. - sJ-' Swat the Fly
;
To rid a town of flies, everybody must do his bit. ' '
There are many kinds of flies all harmful;
Flies breed in filth, feed on it, live in it, and contaminate everything
they lay their hairy little legs on.
It is a very good thing to swat, trap, or poison flies, but it is still bet
ter to prevent their breeding: .
By keeping stables clean.
By removing all manure at least twice a week.
By keeping garbage in receptacles, with close-fitting covers which
should be emptied and washed out frequently.
By building only fly-proof sanitary privies . when sewers are not
available.
The time to begin a campaign against flies is before anv have been
seen in March or in April of each year. ,
A pair of flies born in April may give .origin to millions by August.
Do not let those millions' come into existence. Keep the first pair from
breeding. . - -. '
Strict cleanliness and immediate destruction of all filth are the best
measures against flies. '
Outhouses, homes, markets, bakeries, and all food establishments
should be screened against flies.
Remember: No filth, no flies, less disease.
When A Bulldog Gets Busy
A bulldog was going down the street in a perfect peaceful and happy
state of mind when he was suddenly set upon by three dogs who sought Jo
put him out of business. ' L V
Mr. B. D. never uttered a growl or a bark but got busy and when
the smoke of battle cleared away the three dogs were-running heme
"high" yelping at the top of their lungs. . . .
The conqueror had suffered perhaps greater physical pain than all
three of , the ordinary dogs put together, but never a word of complaint
did he; utter. Just licked his wounds and went on bis way.
Neither did he crow over his success.
It' suddenly came to us' why folks have such a profound admiration
for bulldogs.'' It isn't their ugliness nor their ability to fight nor their
stick-to-il-iveness. It is their thoroughness. When they have a job
to do, they 'get it over with a3 quickly as possible and forget it.
And, it is that same trait in humans that attracts us to them. We
have a great respect for the man who goes about his work, no difference
what the odds, completes it and then goes peacefully on his way.
It is to such that the laurels of success come in great abundance.
The Silver Lining
Press reports of March 7, show inquiry for block of 10,000,000 pounds
of copper, the largest order in nearly five months.
Copper users' yards are bare of stocks and upon receipt of any orders
for goods, they must enter the market.
It is sometimes hard to see the silver lining to a cloud such as has
recently passed over the copper industry, but it is there.
As a matter of fact electrical development, automobile and gas engine
development and general industrial development are now ready to enter
upon an ero of expansion such as ye never dreamed of a few years ago.
Copper is one of the metals that will be used more and more, for it
stands for permanence. The maximum use of copper will be developed
as the public is educated to see the advantage of using it for many
purposes not now attempted.
Lead has, shown signs of life with an advanced price and inquiries
are increasing for copper. (
Freedom from labor troubles and protection and co-operation from
state and national governments will soon help this great employing in
dustry of metal mining to again gain its stride.
Washington Monumet for France
"What more fitting memorial to the gallant sons of America who
fought and died abroad could be devised than an exact reproduction
cf the Washington monument, to be erected, through voluntary contribu
tions by our whole people, upon the famous battle field in France?"
This question is put by 'George Harvey In his weekly. It is a happy
suggestion. The Washington monument fs a splendid piece of work.
No cne who has seen it looming through the mist, or who has watched
the play of sun upon it on a brilliant day, or who has caught a glimpse
or its lorty summit in the rays of searchlights at night, can fail to carry
the picture in his memory.
France sent to America the Statue or Liberty Enlightening the World.
It would only be a gracious act for America to erect in France a reproduc
tion of the noble monument at Washington. Kansas City Star. ..

URGING PROGRAM
British labor, with the only recog
nized rcpresentati"es of labor in the
peace congress, has been particularly
active in urging international regula
tions.
Developments of the past few weeks
in labor, particularly in Great Britain,
have made it likely than an even more
detailed program of labor conventions
will be referred by the peace congress
to the body which is to meet in Wash
ington. . The program which British labor
representatives have submitted to the
international legislation commission
seems likely to be referred with slight
amendments to the October confer
ence. This includes:
Non-employment of children under
15 in industry, six-hour day and two
hours study for children between 15
and IS. and no night Sunday or holi
day work. , .
Continuous weekly rest of 36 hours,
Saturday half holiday and work drfy
of not over eight hours for all workers.
Prohibition on night work by women
or taking work home after a regular
day's work, barring women from dan
gerous or unhealthy work.
Rest period of ten weeks before and
alter childbirth.
- Unemployment insurance.
Special code of laws protectug sea
men. ilecogniiion of right of labor to or

Limitation of restrictions on immi

POSTPONED BV WAR
Smelter Builder and Concen
trator Contractor Examines
Properties; Plans Are An
nounced for Big Extensions
Important mining district construc
tion work, which has been in abey
ance to major extent in' all of the Ari
zona districts since 1916, is indicated
as about to be resumed on extensive
scale.
It is learned that plans calling for
the expenditure of several million dol
lars are complete and that only the de
livery of materials and the assembling
of the necessary skilled construction
forces stand in the way of immediate
beginning of work.
During the last week both A. G. Mc
Gregor, foremost among smelter build
ers in the country and responsible for
the designing and construction of all
the big plants put up in Arizona in
the last several years, and David Cole,
responsible for a great deal in concen
trator construction, have been through
the city on their separate ways to dif- i
ferent mining camps.
McGregor was en route to Jerome,
where he is outlining improvements
which will carry increased capacity as
well as higher efficiency for the new
United Verde Extension smelter. Cole
came here from Globe, en route to
Prescott. At Globe he had submitted
final plans for the construction of a
new mill for the Iron Cap. At Pres
cott he was to take up Arizona Bing
namton plan's for a mill and a tram
way involving several hundred thou
sand dollars new Investment.
The Iron Cap mill is the first large
new concentrator construction to de
velop since 1916. when the Shattuck
mill at Bisbee for the handling of
lead-silver ores was put underway.
Iron Cap was at that time compara
tively in the prospect stage. Since
them it has developed as one of the
most attractive mines in the state and
is looked to with continuance of its de
velopment program to make a large
and very rich mine. In 1918 under the
call of the government for all the cop
per that might possibly be produced.
Iron Cap went at its ore with colors
flying and jumped its production from
around 200,000 pounds per month to
1,000,000 pounds. Since then it has
had considerable recuperating to do
along the line of reaching into new
ore, but it has made fine headway
with this.
The mill now planned for, Iron Cap
and which will be equal to putting
through 600 tons of ore daily, will very
much assist the property to higher
output of metal and higher economic
operation. In the mine there is much
are standing of an excellent concen
trating character and grade whlcii wtn
be made use ' of to much advantage
along with the "direct smelting ore
which the Iron Cap has thus far con
fined itself to in great measure. The
mill and other incidental work in con
nection herewith will mean expendi
ture before through of something like
a million dollars. Above that will be
larger employment, bith on the surface
and underground, which willbe made
way for over a period of many years.
At Jeromd there is like picking up to
be done on the extensive work associ
- 1 ;h preparations for steam shov
eling cf a considerable United Verde
u.c., and wmcn will get- fully under
way just as soon as the readjustment
are worked put that the uncalled for
strike of last month precipitated. In
all there is probably five million dol
lars worth of construction in sight at
this lime. in the mining districts that
is. that much work for completion the
present year, which will still leave;
i seme of the pob s far from finished. ;
i With further decline in the price of i
! materials and improvement in delivery i
!a great deal more of work can be ex-i
pectea to come out, the conduct of

j not economically possible.

DEBATE Otl LEAGUE
OF NATIONS HEARD
BY 3000 111 BOSTON
Senator Lodge and President
Lowell of Harvard Are
Speakers
(Continued from Page One)
statement that although be had al
ways been "an inconsistent republi
can" and frequently had been in agree
ment with Senator Lodge, he could not
agree with his views on the league of
nations covenant anl still less with
those of-his senatorial colleagues.
Dr. Lowell maintained the correct
ness of the covenant in principle, argu
ing that while "very defective in its
drafting" and ''easily misunderstood,"
it should be "accepted and improved."
He described it as an experiment
in open diplomacy.
To meet certain objections raised.
Dr. Lowell advocated the insection of
clauses in the covenant permitting
withdrawals from the league on rea
sonable notice, stipulating that no for
eign powers shall acquire any posses
sions on the American continents and
making it perfectly clear that immi
gration and tariff problems are to be
regarded as purely internal affairs.
Gov. Coolidge Presides
Gov. Calvin Coolidge presided, in
troduced the speakers and held the
watch. Senator Lodge led off, speak
ing for an hour. He. received a noisy
reception and was interrupted with
applause.
Senator Lodge, in opening his ar
gument said that he was not against
a league of nations, but was anxious
to have the free nations of the world
unite te secure peace and bring about
"a general disarmament." He also de
nied the charge of inconsistence be
cause of speeches in 1915 and 1916,
favoring "in general" a league of na
tions. . "The question before us." Senator
Lodge said, "the only question of . a
practical nature, is whether the league
that has been drafted by the commis
sion of the peace conference and laid
before it, will tend to secure the peace
of the world as itstands. and whether
it Is just and fair to the United States
of America."'
In answer to the charge that there
had been no constructive criticism of
the" league of nations, Senator Lodge
exclaimed:
"My first constructive criticism is
that this covenant ought, to be re
drafted." . This is essential, he added,
because the sanctity of treaties Is
vital above all else.
Dr. Lowell laid the premises' for his
argument by asserting that to be ef
fective a league of nations to pre
. vent war must provide for compulsory
arbitration with penalties for the of
fender that no nation would venture
to incur. Punishment should be meted
out not by a council of the league but
automatically by the agreed and im
mediate attitude of the members of
the league who had bound themselves
to resist the aggressor. Then he an
alyzed the proposed covenant to es
tablish that, though there were faults
in the drafting, it offered the mini
mum essentials of an effective anti
war league.
Pact Misunderstood
"The covenant of Paris," he said, "is
very defective in its dnrfting. It is
easily misutiderstobd, and has in fact
been widely" misunderstood. Let us
remember that in its present shape it
is intended only as a draft subject
to correction."
He summarized the provisions of
the covenant and concluded that the
obligations assumed by the members
of the league were "to do, or abstain
from, definite acts, either continuous
ly, or on the happening of events de
bcribed; never under the orders, or by
direction, of any organ of the league.
.The members agree to preserve one
another's integrity and independence
absolutely, not because directed to do
so by the league.'
"On the other hand.' he continued,
the executive council is limited to
consultation, . and recommendations
which the members of the league are
under no obligation to accept.
No Authority Given
"The fear cf a super-sove reign body,
to which we are asked to sacrifice our
independence, is the creation of an
overheated imagination. Xo organ of
the league has any authority to give
commands to this country that need
give us a moment's anxiety. The only
substantial powers that any such body
is to possess, beyond making recom
mendations, are derived from an unan
imous decision in an international dis
pute from an unanimous decision in an
international dispute, contrary to
which a nation may not go to war; and
trom the right to forbid an increase
in armaments or to "direct the duties
of a mandate m case wo first agree
to the reduction of armaments, or to
the assumption of ihu mandate."
Sums Up Arguments
Mr.I-owell sumir.'d up his review
of the league in these word;:
"The Ftrrn.-th of such a league lies
in !h(- bI:g-if'ons assumed directly by
the several members of the league;
and this is both the most effective
and least adventurous method of pre
vent in.? war.
"The opponents ti the league," he
continued, "set up an imaginary scare
rrow of their own creation and then
tired at it i!h i;rca satif ri tiou to
themselves. IC the I'nited S'ates is
not Rubjeet to the orders t executive
f ouncil. it ! senseless to talk of our
being ruled by a body in which we
havp onlv one. vote out of nine."
He discussed the various objections
that had been raised, saying in part:
"An objection brought forward by
the opponent of the league is that
Asiatic immisratjon, the policy of a
protective tariff, or some other mat
ter o fvital domestic interest may be
brought before the cxtci'the council
for inquiry and decided against us

Importance of

(By Review Leased Wire) '

FATE OF MRS. GLENN,
Oil TRIAL FOR LIFE,
IN HANDS OF JURY
Judge's Instructions Empha
sizes Case; Murder Scene
Re-enacted in Court
(Ky Review Leased "Wire)
PHOENIX, Ariz., March . 19. At 3
o'clock this afternoon the jury retired
to consider the evidence in the trial
of Mrs. May Glenn, accused of the
murder cf her husband, Robert Glenn,
at a party in their home last ;Christ
mas night. .
The feature o the closing hours of
the trial before the matter was1 left
to the jurymen was the pantimimic re
production of the defense's version
of the tragedy which marked the Cli
max of theChristmas revelry.
Attorney F. C. Struckmeyer, arrayed
in the bloodstained coat worn by
Glenn the night the bullet ended his
life, armed a juryman with the revol
ver identified as that which sped the
bullet and reproduced for the men in
the box his understanding of the af
fair. During the rehearsal Mrs. Glenn
buried her face . in her handkerchief
and wept.
County Attorney Laney declared in
his argument that no evidence had
been introduced to warrant a plea of
self defense. He added that some
time had elapsed between Glenn's
striking his wife and the firing of the
shot. This, he asserted, indicated pre
meditation. In his instructions to the jury. Judge
Stanford impressed on them the fact
that "evidence that the deceased was
of a quarrelsome and violent disposi
tion toward the defendant is, of itself,
no justification."
Later the judge added, "if, after she
had secured herself from danger she
takes the life of her asasilant in a
spiiit cf revenge or for some unlawful
purpose, she cannot claim exemption
from punishment on the ground of self
defense.
"If you believe from the evidence
beyond a reasonable doubt that imme
diately after the defendant had been
assaulted by Robert Glenn she with
drew out of his reach, and that he
stopped trying to assjjult her further,
and that then she formed the inten
tion oi going into the bed room men
tioned in the evidence and getting a
pistol and shooting Robert Glenn with
it, and that pursuant to such inten
tion she did get such pistol and shoot
and kill him with it, then there is no
self defense in the case and you should
find the defendant guilty."

RETURN OF RAILROAD i

OWNERSHIP IS URGED
Senator Pomerene Declares
Federal Control Should
Not Be Extended
(Bv Review Leased Wire)
CHICAGO. March 19. Senator Pom
erene of Ohio, a democratic member
of the senate Interstate commerce
committee, speaking here tonight be
for the the American Railway Engi
neer's society, opposed extending the
period of government control .over
railroads beyond the 21 months pro
vided by coiisress. He asserted that
the proposed five-year extension was
urged only for the purpose of experi
ment Senator Pomerene also urged early
restoration of the functions of the In
terstate Commerce commission, with
increased powers and the fixing by
congress of a fair standard return
upon capital invested for the rail
roads. "Government control," he asserted,
"was intended for war purposes and
it ought not be continued for peace
purposes, unless some assured, not
speculative or -conjectural advantage
can be gained thereby.
Can't Afford Experiment
, "I, submit, the principles of common
honesty suggested that this property
which ddes not belong to the gov
ernment and which does not belong
to Mr. Hines, director general, should
be given back to the owners within a.
reasonable time, and the people of the
country have sufficient confidence in
government ownership to try it, let us
pass the necessary legislation confis
cating this" property and pay for it as
an honest government ought to pay
for it. But we cannot afford to take
five years to evolve plans and while
we are evolving the plans keep in the
government's possession property
which was tifrned over to it as a war
measure for the purpose of experimen
tation." Senator Pomerene criticised the rail
road administration for ignoring the
Interstate commerce commission in
rates it made and for what he called
''reprehensible" orders setting aside
laws.
Changes Nothing New
"Not one of them," deciared the
senator in referring to the ; admin
istration's orders, "was issued out of
regard for the convenience of . the
public. Not one of them helped, to
win the war. All of them aided in
arousing a spirit of discontent among
the people. -1 deny that the director
general had the power to issue these
orders repealing statutes, but i he
had the power, right poiicy should
nave forbidden it."
Without doubting that the money
was needed. Senator Pomerene said
that in ordering the 25 per cent freight
rate increase more time should have
been given to permit shippers to ad
just their business to meet the ad
vance. This increase, he said, was a
good thing for the railroads, but it
resulted in the bankruptcy of many
people.
Senator Pomerene expressed a, be
lief that the public recognized the
need for a general advance in wages
for railroad employes, joint use of
terminals, interchange of equipment
and greater control over routing of
freight, but said that tehse changes
in operation have proved nothing new.

LEAGUE OF NATIONS
ONLY WAY TO STOP
WAR, SAYS MAURICE
Former Chief of British Arm
ies Declares Majority
Favors Plan
(Ey Review Leased Wire)
NEW YORK, March 18. Because
"there is some hope of making war
impossible through a League of Na
tions, but no hope of doing it any
other way," Major Gen. Sir Frederick
Maurice .former director of military
operations of the British general staff,
declared here tonight that he favored
the project. The general, who held
his military portfolio from 1915 to
the early part of 1918. added his opin
ion that "a great majority" of the
British people were enthusiastic for
the league plan.
Arriving in this county for a stay
of several mont'is General Maurice
told interviewers that for the first
time in history the British people had
been at war, "and they don't like it."
Previous conflicts involving the em
pire, he said, had been fought "with
the fleet, gold and a proportionately
small army, "but this time the whole
nation had been engaged. For every
American mother who had lost a son.
he added, 15 British and 20 French
mothers were in mourning for the
same cause, and this had a tremen
dous influence on popular sentiment,
at least in Great Britain, for an in
strumentality offering a chance of
preventing future wars.
In France, where Sir Frederick re
cently traveled extensively, he assert
ed the desire was paramount to make
Germany impotent as securety for
France's future safety. But he pre
dicted that as soon as the terms of
the league covenant were settled
French opinion would be more fa
vorable than at present.
The general reported England "al
most unanimously opposed to con
scription," but said it would be neces
sary for a, few months, to replace the
regular army disorganized by the war.

TRIAL OF HUSBAND
Man Who Killed Roosevelt's
Big Game Hunting Partner
Face Court; Five Letters
Base Story
...... .
special to tne Review
N. E. A.
LONDON, England.
Norman Cecil Rutherford, colonel j
of riding field ambulance. Is on trial
for the murder of his wife's-friend.
Major Miles Charles Cariston Seton!
big game hunter in Africa, shooting
partner of Roosevelt.
Fourteen bullets were pumped into
the body of Major Seton and they
lound Colonel Rutherford standing
over the dead man with a smoking
revolver. It was empty and the col
oned said:
"I only wish I had another builet
for myself."
The police took from the colonel his
traveling bag. In the bottom were
-ive letters from his wife.
They tell a tragic story of a worn
m's love, of her struggle against
loubt and her final determination to
eek her freedom.
The first one of July 27, says:
"Your long letter came this evening.
The few words at the end rend my
Tear. Darling, have you ever known
ae mericless and refusing forgiveness?
Jnlv come back to me to helD me to

he most vital part of me bow, for in

aave suffered tortures both mental
md physical, that must shortly in
the end have killed- me.
"Love me with the Btrength of your
being, and I will not fail.' Come back
to me and I will be waiting as ever."
The next one aftec an interval of
two months, told of s begging suit for
divorce and said:
"You complained of "me once for
not being sufficiently candid with you.
This time I will be, as I have been
through hell this last week alone.
"H went and put the case before
them. They asked me to go on, and
conjured m to go in the box, but I
refused refused with tears, as I
thought I still loved you.
VrtTmr T I .1 wn 1 ln,TA -1 '
. , , i
atoin of faith in you or trust in your :
promise
"This is my last word. I have strug
gled to show I have trusted and" loved,
but the end is inevitable and in com
mon justice I may tell you so."
Again after an interval of six weeks
a further letter contained the follow-
ing:
"I want to gain my freedom with as
little suffering to you as possible, and
if for the children's sakes you will
agree to carry the thing through with
as lime puoiicuy as yossiDie, i wm
hand over to you the three elder chil
dren. I should not feel that you were
utterly broken. Please make the rest
of my task as easy as possible, for the
sake of all that I have so far borne
for you."
The next letter dated November 7
acknowledged a letter of the accused
of November 3. It contained the fol
lowing: "You intend to fight me for the
children, but you will never get them.
"You know well that through your
awful temper .and freqment ill-usage of
me you have suffered greatly in the
eyes of your children..,,
"Your love for me-nag been of the
wrong kind; jotir love has always
been artificial. The remainder of my
life will be a t -rse' to you forever
more." The last letter was dated. November
29, and said: ------
"My dear Norman: The children
were all delighted with their war sou
venirs, which now adorn the library.
"I am very unhappy. Dr.' D. is
going to write to you about divorce !
pdoceedings. He imagines, after much
discussion, that I still care for you.
Candidly, other men have never been
more, than an episode in my life, but
you were life itself.
"That does not alter the fact I
would give anything for a merciful
. Providence to get me out of it. I do
not think anyone realizes that love
such as I gave you can never com
pletely die. I am convinced that your
nature can never change."

One-half of the war gardens were opened for the employes March 1st.
Tne BOil ws in excellent condition, having been plowed about ten inches
deep with a tractor. The remaining gardens were opened as soon as ready,
the last being assigned during June.
SEASON AND SEED
The first part of the gardening season was very unfavorable for plants
such a3 pptatoes, cabbage and beets, as it was - too cold at night. However,
it was favorable for vegetables such as radishes, onions, lettuce, etc., and
largercrops of these were raised. The summer and tall seasons were favorable
for rapid growth of vegetables that ordinarily do best at this time and very
good crops were raised.
The total number of gardens planted was 686; 435 gardens were re
tained by those originally assigned gardens;- 251 gardens were re-assigned,
some pf them as many as eight times; 110S assignments In all were made.
The chief reason for gardens being given up was. due to men leaving. Detailed
reports were made by 75 .gardeners, and a general survey was made of all
gardens, noting the approximate amount raised.

LONDON. March 19. During debate
in committee in the house of commons
today on the military service bill Win
ston Spender Churchill, minister of
war, opposing the amendment limit
ing the operation of the bill to De
cember 311919, instead of April 30,
1920, emphasized the fact that the
British regular army had virtually dis
appeared and that it was necessary to
keep men whom the bill retained with
the colors for overseas garrison. Mr.
Churchill said he had every hope, how
ever, that the British foreign estab
lishment would be on voluntary basis
before the end of the year.
The army of occupation, he added,
was on a different plan and could not
depend on voluntary recruiting.
Conditions in Europe were getting

tnus conclusively proving, tnat tnin-i
! ness, weakness, debility and neuras-
thenia are almost invariably due toj
nerve starvation. Feed your nerves j
and all these symptoms due to nerve ;
starvation will disappear. ;
Eminent specialists state that the j
best nerve food is an organic phos-.
phate known among druggists as '
Bitro-Phosphate. a five-grain tablet of

j Being a genuine nerve-builder and not j
a stimuiaut or habit-iormmg drug, i
Bitro-Phosphate can be safely taken
by the weakest and most delicate suf

are often Bimply astonishing.
Weak, tired people regain strength
and vigor; thinness and angularity

Mining and Financial News
BY REVIEW
NEW YORK, March 19. The stock
market today was governed by the
same influences that have character
ized the operations of the past few
weeks, professional interests were in
absolute control, but some divergence
of sentiment was reported between lo
cal tradrs and "the Western con
tingent." Shipping held their supremacy of
the previous session at gains of one
to four points, secondary equipments
ranking next at similar advances, fol
lowed by sugars, electrical Issues,
leathers and the usual unclassified
shares.
Oils, motors, industrial alcohol, to
baccos and several of the better
known utilities were hesitant or
heavy and rails retained their listless
attitude. United States steel fell .a
fraction under yesterday's minimum
and continued under pressure until
the final hour, when heavy buying ef
fected a sharp rally at a net gain of
1.
Reactions of one to four points
from top levels 'featured the later
dealings, the setback coinciding with
an advance in call money to six per
cent, due to withdrawal of bank loans,
an irregular tone prevailing at the
close. Sales amounted to 925,000
shares.
Trading in bonds was moderate and
featureless, steadiness ruling in Lib
erty and other domestic issues, for
eigns yielding slightly. Total sales,
par values, aggregated $10J50,000.
Old United States registered 2's eased
Vs and coupon 2's rose V on call.
GRAIN MARKET
CHICAGO, March 19. Cora prices
averaged lower today, influenced by
prospective competition from Argen
tina. . The close was unsettled, at lc
decline to lc advance, with May
$1.43 to $1.43 and July $1.3514 to
$1.35. Oats finished 14 off to up,
and provisions varying from 50c de
cline to a rise of 30c.
In the oats market values were up
held by reports that many Illinois
farmers had abandoned the idea of
seeding spring wheat and instead
plant a normal acreage of oats.
; Provisions sympathized with the
weakness of corn.. Lard, though, was
an exception owinsj to scantiness of
offerings. ! -

PLAN TO POT CIVIL
SERVICE BILL TO VOTE
Warren District Club Pro
poses Election on Law
Defeated in Senate
Owing to the failure of the Soldiers
and Sailors' Civil Service bill, known
as senate bill Xo. Ill, to pass the leg
islature, it, is the intention of those
fostering the bill to have it initiated.
At the semi-monthly meeting of the
Warren District Soldiers' and Sailors'
club, held at the Odd Fellows hall last
night, the "report of the local commit
tee sent to Phoenix for the purpose of
watching the progress of the bill was
read.
The report stated that the bill was
introduced into the senate by Senator
T. A. Hughes, ana indications were
that the bill would safely pass, judg
ing from the way In which it was re
ceived. A committee of three, con
sisting of Col. Power Conway, Capt.
Victor Harding and Lieut. Stephen B.
Rayburn, met with the local commit
tee and made a careful examination
.of the bill, and then endorsed it in
the name of the Great War Veterans'
society and a letter was addressed to
the four legislators of this district..
Later during that week Senator
Hughes said he suspected that a move
ment was on foot to kill the bill, but
he insisted, even threatened, he said,
to have a record made of those mem
bers who dared vole against the bill.
Recommend Initiative
The committee's report recommends
that the returned service men put
their shoulders to the wheel and put
the bill over as an initiative measure.
If the bill is put to the vote of the
citizens it will receive the support ot
everyone, the report concludes.
In a brier'taTR-made by Senator
Hughes, be said -b.ewas.-SO anxious for
the bill to pass, that he did all in his
power to maker.it a law. Senator
Hughes quoted at length the advance
ment of civil service methods in Great
Britain and this, country. He strong
ly condemned .the -"spoil law" and
policy of holding state employes in
their jobs as long as their political
friends saw fit.
"Under civil service law," said Sen
ator Hughes, "an employe could hold
his or her job only as long as they
were competent and that might mean
they would have a life job. You men
here who fought and gave everything
for your country deserves the right
of trying for a state job, in fact you
are entitled to it more than any other
person, end under just laws at least
5000 returned men should be employed
by the state.
"I am determined to support this bill
and use every Influence I can to see
that it is not killed. It is because I
think the bill is just and because of
its emergency, that I am going to help
the bill."
Four Committees Named
Four committees were appointed by
the members of the club and it will
be their duties along respective
lines to make the ciub a great suc
cess. Following are the names of the
four committees appointed last night:
Entertainment, Messrs. Campbell,

ment, Messrs. Egan, Ross, '-McKean

that a membership of several hundred
will be attained before many weeks.
