W ITH THE AMERICAN ARMY ON
THE MARNE, July 16 (By the As
sociated Press). French and Ameri
can forces lighting together have re
ceptured the village of St. Agnan, hill
223, to the northwest and La Cbapelle
Montbodon. In co-operation with the French, the
Americans launched a heavy counter
pttack this morning between these two
villages, driving the enemy steadily
back.
On the American right, the French
made rapid progress, and all through
the section the Germans were fiercely
attacked by the allied, with the re
sult that they have withdrawn for a
considerable distance.
Comparatively large forces of Amer
icans have been engaged, especially In
the region of Descrivec, where they
were brought up to support the at
tacking French. Within a short pe
riod the Americans were hotly engag
ed in the righting.
In counter attacking operations dur
in the day the Americans increased
their number of prisoners materially,
and at this hour it is possible to an
nounce that the entire operation is
going well and that all conditions are
extremely satisfactory.
Throughout the Germans fought
with the utmost stubbornness, being
loath to give up ground but there de
clared to have been unable to with
stand the storming of the allied troops,
whose advance was preceded by a4ter
rific fire. Only to the south of the
Bois Des Rochet did the enemy suc
ceed in holding his ground tempo
rarily. GERMAN LOSSES SEAVY
WASHINGTON, July 16 The war
department tonight received informa
tion from the American military at
tache at Paris of heavy losses sus
tained by the German assaulting arm
ies to the west and east of Rheims i
and of the failure of the enemy Id
make substantial progress against the
allied resistance during the last twenty-four
hours. No late cable dispatch
es had been received from either Gen
eral Pershing or General Bliss.
The war department isaued this
statement.
"At midnight the war department
was not in receipt of late cable dis
patches from General Bliss or General
Pershing, but it was in communica
tion with the military attache at Paris.
Information from this last source does
not deal specifically with the day's
point of attack and defense, but brings
information of heavy losses sustained
by the enemy's attacking forces and
and of his failure to make substantial
progress against the allied resistance
during the past twenty-four hours.
General Pershing's communique for
yesterday had not been received at the
department late tonight. In the ordi
nary course it would have come this
morning, but probably has been de
layed by the crowded condition of the
cable.
So far as was known tonight no in
formation as to the losses among tne
American troops in yesterday's fight
ing has yet been received.

SAYS DISPATCH FROM THE FRONT
PARIS, July 1 6. The German offensive has taken on
a great scale equal to that launched on the 2 1 st of March,
says a dispatch filed from the Marne battle front today at
noon by the correspondent of the Temps.
Fighting continued this morning, the dispatch says, in
a violent storm of thunder and lightning. The weather was
clearing at noon. An impression of confidence throughout
the armies is indicated by the latest dispatches from various
parts of the battle front.
Elite German armies are engaged along the sixty miles
of fighting ront, the correspondent adds, including three
divisions of the imperial corps guards with picked regiments
from Bavaria, Wurttemburg, Saxony and Silesian Prus
sian. The battle has been baptized "friendenssturm" or
"storm of peace," the correspondent reports.

TRY TURNING MANEUVER
WITH THE FRENCH ARMY IN j
FRANCE. July 16 (By The Associated j
Press). Having met defeat in every
effort to advance today east of Rheims,
the Germans turned their attention
toward pushing the advantage they
had gained west of that city. Strong
columns which crossed the Marne
tried throughout the day to ascend the :
river on both banks toward Epernay. j
Their powerful dashes were met stead-
ily by the French who contested every
foot of ground. '
Battles proceeded simultaneously on
the right and left banks of the river.
The German line of advance appears ,
to be venteuil on tne nortnern DnnK
and Oeuily on the southern bank. The
position is somewhat confused tonight
and it is bard to tell where the op
posing columns are. The Germans de
sire by this movement evidently to
turn the strong position, formed by
the forest and mountain of Rheims
from the south, as an effort at a front
al attack would probably lead to dis
aster. The general impression tonight
is that the position is favorable for
the allies, whose tenacity and prepar
edness unquestionably surprised the
Germans, upsetting their plans for a
rapid initial success.

one of the bullets went through the
young lady's hat and the other through
her tie. Mrs. James was arrested and
was tried In Tombstone. An effort
was first made to get a change of

denied. The case was called for trial
on Monday, May 13th, and it took four
days to try the case. The Jury reache.l
a verdict on Friday but were unable
to report the verdict into court be
cause the defendant was shaming a

WASHINGTON. J ily 16 Govern
ment demand for steel has reached
such proportions, it was learned today,
beeause of the growth of the war pro
gram, that the war industries board
fears present sources of supply soon
will prove inadequate.
At today's meeting of the board man
ufacturers were warned that those who
have obtained steel on priority orders
for war work and later were found to
be re-selling it to non-war manufac
turers would have their supply cut off
This practice was probably in vogue
the board learned.
Chairman Hurley of the shipping
board, conferred today with officials
of the war industries board regarding
the requirements for the shipbuilding
program. Production of ships is show
ing such a marked improvement that
it may be possible to turn out five
ships a year from each way in some
yards, four ships in other yards and
lesser numbers tlscwhere.
If efforts to bolster up the efficiency
of the weaker new yards are success
ful It is evident to officials' that the
size of steel plate mills must be in
creased or the shipping program will
be delayed by lacK of material. A
shortage of steel already is being felt
in some yards.
Addition to steel mills now being
made will add 750.000 tons to the an
nual output in a few months, but on"i

cient to take care of the increased
demand.

The statement Bays:
"Today the Germans, who have not

The German offensive east nnd

Rheims "the situation is unchanged."
The only claim made to any success
by the Germans is that there were

ATTORNEY 0. GIBSON
FILES LETTER
VITHJOARD
Calls Attention to Previous
Removal Petition Still Pend
ing in Supreme Court ; They
Are Liable for Contempt
When the county seat removal peti
tions were filed in Tombstone on Mon
day, Attorney O. Gibson of Toaibstone,
filed the following letter with the
board calling their attention to the
condition of the previous case, that i3
now pending in the supreme court and
stating that the board was liable lor
contempt if they took any action in
the petition that was filed on Monday:
July 15. 1918.
To the Honorable Board of Supervis
ors, of Cochise County:
In the outset I wish to say that
this letter is written in a spirit of
friendliness for the board, i.eatizins
that any duties you may have to per
form, in regard to the matters ois
cussed, are thrust upon you by law,
and that you have no option but to
perform them, except as you are re
strained from doing so by order of
court.
I desire to call your attention to
the condition of the case of the un
dersigned against yourselves. In
which a writ of prohibition issued,
restraining you from taking any ac
tion upon the petition filed in your
office during May, 1917, asking that
an election be called to change the
location of the county seat of Cochise
county.
Permit me to say, first, that said
case is now. pending upon appeal, in
the supreme court of the state of Ari
2ona. The proceedings in said case may
be tersely stated as follows:
The clerk's notice to voters that
said petition had been filed was dated
June 11, 1917. June 12, 1917, I ob
tained an order, directing that c
writ of prohibition issue, and a writ
was issued by the clerk, on June 24th,
and served promptly by the sheriff.
A hearing was had upon this peti
tion November 7, 1917.
On November 10, 1917, Judge Bax
ter, who heard the case, filed his writ
ten decision, dissolving the writ of
prohibition.
On December 12, 1917, Judge Baxter
fixed the amount of supersedeas bond,
for the purpose of superseding his or
der of November 10, 1917.
December 15, 1917, said bond was
approved by Judge Baxter, and the ap
peal in said case was perfected, a no
tice of appeal having been filed a few
days previous to the approval of said
bond, and the supreme court, there
fore, acquired jurisdiction of said
cause.
On December 17, 1917, you held an
official session for the purpose of con
sidering said petition, and on said
hst mentioned date entered your
order dismissing aid petition, lor
certain irregularities brought to ydur
attention. The said order of prohibi
tion having been restored to full force
by the supersedeas bond, approved
December 15, 1917, two days before
your session was held, your act in dis
missing said petition was nugatory
and void, and you were technically in
contempt of court for considering said
petition.
My position in the matter is that
the petition filed in May of la.-t vear
is still before you, name having never
been legally disposed of.
Section 4, of Chapter 5, of the Acts
of the First Regular Session of 1915
jrovides that:
"Any number of petitions for such
removal may be so bigned, and when
filed in the office of the board of su
pervisors shall be attached together
and deemed to be one petition."
In the view I entertained of the
matter under Section 4 just quoted,
it will be necessary to attach the prior
petition to the new petition just filed,
and since you are prohibited by the
order of June 12, 1917, from consider
ering the old petition, and since the
old petition is by law made a part o:
the new petition, you are prohibited,
by the writ of prohibition, from tak
ing any action on the new petition as
separate and distinct from the old
one. until the decision of the appeal In
the case aforesaid.
I brought the case aforesaid in
good faith, and have prosecuted same
in that spirit up to this time, and
now notify the board that I propose
that the writ of prohibition, issued
out of a court of record of this state,
shall be respected, until the supreme
court has passed upon the question
involved; and if the board takes any
action upon the petition lately filed,
I shall ask the supreme court of Ari
zona tor a citation against each mem
ber of the board for contempt of the
supreme court, wherein the jurisdic
tion of said case is now lodc-d, for
taking such action.
Respectfully submitted.
O. GIBSON.

the fiif.t day may have upset the en
emy's calculations could not be guess
ed by the meager accounts received
toilav that cave anv specific informa
tion f a military character. It ap
pears certain American forces nave
held this door against the enemy,
nmmntlv restoring the e-eneral trend
of their original lines wherever the
rush of yesterday had swept tnem

the east of the: original American po-sni-.ns.
There the enemy apparently
w firmlv Indeed across the river and
heavy pressure is being brought by
Franco-American rorces to eject mm.
The German position here appears
somewhat precarious. It was agreed
that inless they were able without
great delay to extend their advance
ami widen the dent. General Foch
misht swing a flank assault from the
American positions to tne wesi in au
effort to trap the army of General
Lcchm, which Berlin claims crossed
the river here.
The official report from Paris to
night showed the Franco-American
forces had recaptured St. Agnan and
the heiehts dominating the Marne val
ley behind the German advanced posi
tinnd Thin led to the hope among
officers that a wide flanking move
ment would be possible wnicn would
clear the south bank of the river of the
enemy and probably result in import
ant captures of prisoners. The fact
the defenders are hitting DacK nara
appears to make it certain that the
Germans have been able to make only
limited improvement of their position.
This is the first great battle in which
the Americans have engaged. If any
confusion developed, the swiftness and
certainty with which counter attacks
were sent home shows that it was
quickly overcome.
Many officers believe the real on
ject of the drive was to widen the
German line along the Marne so a
later blow could be delivered with
Chateau Thierry and the line north
west of there as the center of attack
and reduction o the Compiegne sali
ent as its objective.
In the event, a coincident attack
southe of Amiens aimed directlv at
Compiegne, it was thought, would have
been delivered and if Compiegne fell,
the German advance could either be
directed against Faris or the scene be
shifted for a fresh blow at the channel
ports through the British lines to the
north.
So far as the nresent drive goes,
much satisfaction is taken here in the
fact that the- German right ran into
an abrupt check against the Americans
who still hold what will be the very
center of assault i a new thrust at
Paris is to follow the present effort.

MANCHESTER, July 16 (By
The Associated Press). -r-Amer-ican
troops which came J ere to
day were greeted , with the great
est enthusiasm. The Star Spangled

the Dragoon Guards and the band
accompanying the troops respond

delivered an address of welcome
as the men marched through the

"I am sure." he said in part,
"you are worthy comrades of your

ing themselves with glory in
France."
where the enemy made immense en
deavors to advance as far as possible
south of the Marne towards Mont
mirail, which it was his intention to
reach In the course of the first day's
fighting.
The Franco-Amercan resistance,
however, prevented the Germans from
executing tfis plan. The strength of
their effort is shown by the fact that
they engaged fourteen divisions ap
proximately 170.000 men in the first
line in this part of the battle field.
Behind these were prpbably four
teen additional divisions, some of
which, owipe to the losses sustained
by the nen in the front line were .cone
pelled to take part in the fighting.
On the eastern side of Rheims where
the Germans met such a severe, check
vesterday, they also had about four
teen divisiens in the front line with a
similar number in reserve. In conse
quence of the na'ure of the fih'iiig
there the Germans suffered terrih'y
and their troops were obliged to halt
for the purpose of rorganizing.

BERLIN, via London, July 16. On
the Marne front the enemy has deliv
ered violent counter attucks, says the
German official communication issued
this evening. "There were some lo
cal successes to the southwest of
Rheims."
"To the east of Rheims the situation
is unchanged."
BERLIX. via London, July 16. The
Germans claim the capture of 13.000
prisoners, in the official communica
tion from headquarters issued today.
The army of General Von Boehm, it is
added, crossed the Marne between
Jaulgonne and east of Doimans.
The statement says:
"In some sectors fighting activity
has revived. East of the Ayette an
enemy night advance was repulsed, as
was also a strong enemy attack east
of Hebuturne. Between the Aisne and
the Marne and east of Chateau Thier
ry there were lively artillery duels.
"In minor enterprises and during an
advance across the Marne to the south
west of Jaulgonne we broke into the
enemy's lines and brought back some
prisoners. ,
"Yesterday to the southwest and
east of Rheims we penetrated into
part of the French positions.
"By their devastating effect, the ar
tillery, mine throwers and gag throw
ers, together with our tanks and flame
throwers, opened the way into the en
emy's positions. The army of Gen
eral Von Boehme has crossed the
Marne between Jaulgonne and east of
Dornians.
"At daybreak pioneers transported
storming troops across the river and
thereby created the foundation for the
success of the day. The infantry storm
ed the steep, slopes on the southern
bank of the JIarne a-:d under their
cover the constructions ol bridg?s was
carried out.", t ' , ' . "
"In steady fighting we thrust
through the stubbornly defended wood
ed country "of the first positions and
drove the enemy back toward bin rear
lines at Conde-jla-Ciiapello-Monthodon.
"Xorth of the JIarne we also wrest
ed from the French and Italians their
first position between the Ardre nid
the Marne. In the evening we were
fighting to the east of the Chatilloii-
j Cuchery line.
I "The. armies of Generals Von Murda
! and Von Rinon attacked the enemy in
t hampagne from Prunay, east of
Rheims, as far as Tahure, and in in
encounter with the enemy, who was
avoiding our attack, we captured the
first French positions.
"To the south of Mauroy and-Moron-villiers
we pushed forward across the
Cornillet-Hoghberg-Keilberg ridge of
heights to the crater field of last
year's battle as far as the Roman road
to the northwest of Prosnes and into
the wooded country south of Fichtel
berg. "To the east of the Suippes
wrested from the enemy the field of
the Champagne battle between Auber
ive and southeast of Tohure.
"On our front of attack cast of
Rheims the enemy is holding his sec
end positions to the north of Prosnes,
Souwain and Perthes.
"In spite of low clouds and a high
wind our aerial fighting force was ac
tive. From a low altitude our avia
tors with bombs and machine guns at
tacked in the battle on the ground.
Yesterday they brought down over the
battle field thirty-one enemy airplanes
and four captive balloons.
"The number of prisoners brought
in up to the' present amounts to more

CHICAGO, July 16 Soaking rains
and biff receipts did much today to
weaken the corn market. Although at

ied. . Advices that the moisture supply
had been so heavy and widespread
that it was likely to head off any dry
weather talk for a considerable while,
led to general selling. Oats were gov

Increases in the stock of ribs where

Arizona Responds Quite
Magnificently to Fourth of
July Suggestion of Wilson
Reports that have come to the Ari
zona council of defense show that Ari
zona gave inagnilioent response to
the president's suggestion that resi
dents of foreign ancestry or birth join
in the celebration of the Fourth of
July as a new independence day for
the peoples of the world. The fourth
was more generally celebrated in Ari
zona than ever before and in nearly
every community there was partici
pation of the foreign element of ths
population, wiio marched in Fectlons
of the parades, presented emblematic
floats, mingled in the main exercises
of the day or held patriotic meetings
of their own. At no point dyl there
appear a single feature of discdW, the
celebration pledging the people of the
state as a whole to the nation's serv
ice, without regard to race or lan
guage. The new regulations of the depart
ment of labor for the importation of
Mexican labor demand provision of
fair wages, good housing and sanitary
conditions, with temporary lifting ol
the illiteracy, head-tax and contract
labor features of the immigration laws.
Indeed, no alien of this sort shall be
admitted unless under contract for hi3
work. If the alien fails to work for
two weeks he may be arrested and de
ported as a trifler. An interesting fea
ture of the regulations is that each
Vlexican laborer shall open a postal
savings account, in which shall be de
posted by his employer, taken from
wages, the sum of 25 cents a day, pay
able when the laborers leave the coun
try. After the deposit reaches $100,
only i a month shall be so withheld.
The number of Mexicans available this
year has been' materially lessened by
pro-German propaganda south of the
line, telling that poor wages are paid
and that every laborer is liable to
conscription in the army.

EARNING POWER
German Owned Concerns
Made Great Dividends for
Stockholders According to
Testimony Given
(By Review Leased Wire)
NEW YORK, July 16. Details of
huge earnings by a group of German
established chemical companies In this
country were offered as evidence to
day in the state attorney general's in
quiry based on suspicions of the alien
property custodian that the transfer
of controlling interest In the concerns
from German to American hands was
a "dummy transaction." During the
last five years, the government show
ed the Niagara Electro-Chemical com
pany of Niagara Falls, N. Y.. one of
the corporations involved in the inves
tigation reported average annual earn
ings of 1142 per cent and dividends of
1010 per cent. The Roessler & Hass
lacheri Chemical company of New
York earned 46 per cent and the Perth
Amboy Chemical company of Perth
Amboy, N. J., 59 per cent in the same
period.
COCHISE COUNTY WILL
FURNISH EIGHTEEN MEN
The local board of Cochise county
has received notice from General Crow-
der that they will be called upon to
furnish eighteen men to report for
duty between the 5th of August and
August 10th. These men will leave
Tombstone and will entrain for Camp
Fremont, for training. This camp is
located just across the bay from San
Francisco and these will be the first
Arizona men to be sent there.
The state has been called upon to
furnish 180 and it is estimated that
these men can be furnished by the
various boards from class 1 of the
original draft on account of the. re
classification. No men of the class
of 1918 will be drawn to- fill this quota
but any desiring to volinteer may do
so, and be included in the call.
Maricopa county beads the list in
the number of men to be called under
the above selection and Cochise county
is second. The following Is the ap
portionment of the various counties in
the state: Apache, 3; Cochise, 18;
Coconino, 10: Gila, 15: Graham, 7:
Greenlee. 8: Maricopa. 30; Mohave, 7;

Women's comniitties In county coun
cils of defense, covering most of the

ally on the conservation of babie?, and
expects to save 100.0'iO of them to their
parents and the nation this year. The
work Is official, under the Children's
bureau of the department of labor.
Plans under way include: better birth
registration, better administration of
clean milk laws, establishment of chil
dren's health centers, improvement of!
pre-natal conditions, betterment of;

One state council of defense urges!
that there he no gossip regarding per-1
sons suspected of disloyalty. It is far'
a county council or the authorities for
quiet investigation.
In the work of county councils of
defense all over the nation it has been
found both just "and advisable to in
clude women as members in all com
munities. The women form a link with
the Red Cross and similar organiza
tions, they do the work of welfare
committees better than men could and
they have a keen insight into the con
ditions that should surround the young
soldier that serves to help any com
mittee on which they may Maveme.ni
bership. In arizona especially, this
rule is recommended.
In several states, the councils of de
fense have found it necessary to pass
resolutions urging employers to keen
their conscripted employes constantly
up to the day of their induction into
service. The question of temporary
employment of men out of work when
called to the draft has been settled
very satisfactorily at many points by
county councils.
URGES MORE CARE
IN HANDLING GARBAGE
Greater care In the handling cf
garbage of the Warren district, both
on the part. of the people themselves
and the city. Is urged by Dr. R. B. Dur
fee, city and county bacteriologist.
This situation is one demanding con
stant care and attention, be said.
He emphasized upon the fact that
no decomposing matter should be
thrown out on any dust or ash heap
or any place but in the garbage can.
Such refuse as bit3 of meat, coffee and
tea grounds and the peelings of vege
tables, was what he referred to. Mat
ter of this kind will soon become of
fensive and in time dangerous, espe
cially now in the warm weather when
a few days retention of garbaga will !
cause it to be a nuisance to everyone j
in the neighborhood.
City officials as well as the people I
should see that no garbage or rubbish
accumulates, furnishing a place for !
flies to breed, he said. This may be
done by disposing of the garbage as 1
soon as possible and keeping the cans j
clean and free from all decaying mat- i
ter. Care should be taken by all gar
bage cans are not emptied on the
ground instead of in their sacks for it j
is in and around the garbage can that
flies find a condition favorable for
their breeding.

ANOTHER JOB
"Billy" Spear, editor of the Phoenix
Republican, is a glutton for punishment.
Compelled, like all other newspapermen,
on account of proverbial poverty, to stay
away from the coast on account of an in
crease rather than a summer decrease in
railroad fares, the Phoenix editor sits in his
Phoenix furnace and writes kindly of Mc
Adoo, the cause of all his misery, as fol
lows :
"Phoenix owes a debt of gratitude to
Mr. McAdoo, or, perhaps, rather to the rail
road men under him who tell him how to
direct railroads and get him to do things
which they were afraid to do themselves'
when they were running the roads. They
were afraid of the people and of each other.
They were afraid to fix higher rates for the
people were already greatly "het up"
against the roads. Anyway, the railroad
administration should be the recipient of
the gratitude of fhoenix for the delightful
climate we are now enjoying; or else for
our self-adjustment to the climate. Many
of us who in years past felt we could not
stand the Salt River valley climate, or, at
least, a part of it, say two weeks or a month
of it some time between June 1 and August
I, find this year that it is quite bearable,
thanks again to the railroad administration.
"It doesn't make us half as hot to stay
here and see the summer through as it doe3'
to think of paying full legal mileage, with
the 8 per cent tax added, to which is to be
added the Pullman fare with still 10 per
cent more computed on the whole thing.
In comparison with that, we find the mid
summer climate of the Salt River valley
equable and almost frigid.
"Then, again, we miss the railroad sum
mer posters, pictures of the seashore with
its human mermaids basking on the beach,
illustrating what can be accomplished in
conservation of clothing. We do not see
the cooling mountain tops and placid lakes
and inviting trout streams. There are none
of these things to lure us away from our
own old reliable climate. Psychology does
not lend its aid to dissatisfy us with a tem
perature of anywhere from 1 00 to 1 1 0 in
the shade. Blessed be Mr. McAdoo for
the removal of all these temptations which
in the past have assailed our morals and
our purses. We shall have more money
at the end of the season and we shall not
return then worn out with strenuous vaca
tions. ,
The Salt River valley, too, will gain a
better reputation abroad. Throngs of
Phoenicians at coast points will not be there
to advertise a degree of heat at home which
exists only in their imagination or which
they offer as. a pretext for anything."
REAL PROTECTION FOR BOTH
(From rhoenix Gazette)
At the regular election in November will
be offered to the voters of Arizona an op
portunity to vote an amendment to the
state constitution which will provide for
state liability insurance and for workmen's
compensation. This is a subject of the very
greatest importance and one in which there
are but few people living in the state who
are not interested.
Of course the parties most interested
are the laboring classes both skilled and
unskilled and the large employers of
labor. But there is hardly a business that
is not interested, directly or indirectly, and
most of the individuals not engaged in
dangerous occupations are affected.
The petitions for the submission of this
amendment have been circulated by repre
sentatives cf the employer class and of the
labor class through agents o.f the unions
after favorable action by the unions. The
amendment, which provides stipulated
compensation for injuries incurred during
employment, takes away none of the rights
of civil action now enjoyed by anyone. The
provisions of the amendment are purely
elective and a person injured while at work
miy accept compensation as provided in
this amendment or may elect to bring a
civil action under the existing laws. Sim
ilarly the employer may avail himself of
the insurance provided by the state under
this amendment or he may elect to carry
his own insurance and abide by the present
laws.
It would be difficult to frame a fairer law
to aH parties concerned is the opinion oF
representatives of both employes and em
ployers who have examined the amendment
and are familiar with it. One of the finest
features of the amendment is the elimin
ation of the ambulance-chasing attorney
who heretofore has prospered from the mis
fortunes of others. This amendment will
force him to seek other lines of business.
Up to the present time there have been
no valid objections offered to the amend
ment. Favorable action by the voters is
confidently expected.
e
PATRIOTISM
Didn't you thrill with patriotism when
you read of the successes won by American
soldiers around Chateau Thierry and else
where along the Marne?
Didn't you feel proud of being an Amer
ican and of having relatives or friends who
might be there on, the front line giving a
good account of themselves and their coun
try; and weren't you proud to belong to a
nation of such men ?
It may be that the American troops will
be pushed back from their present posi
tions; thousands may be captured, but of
one thing we all may feel assured: There
will be no cowardice, no lack of willing
ness to serve their country and humanity
in this crisis.
Germany adopted the course of deriding
our war efforts, our fighting men and the
effect their induction into the battle line
would have. Speakers and writers in the
German press have belittled everything
American until the average man or woman
behind the Hun lines' dismissed us with a
shrug cf the shoulders, as being inconse
quential in the final settlement of the war.
America, extending her efforts in all.
directions for the quick fruition of her war
program, well can afford to smile patiently
and "dig in" just a little harder. The Huns
may have been taught to disregard our
fighting qualities and look upon America
as a nation of penny-grabbers, caring for
nothing except money, but the shock troops
upon which the Hun high command de
pended so greatly for success, these have
learned to respect , the Yanks. They have
learned that the Germans are as lightly re
garded by their adversaries as they, in turn,
have been taught to look upon Americans.
While the Yanks are not all from Mis
souri, the Missouri attitude of "show me"
permeates their ranks, and mind what we
tell you :
It will take an awful lot of "showing"
by the Germans to overcome those Yan
kee soldiers, who are proving themselves
invincible.
CITED
Stars and Stripes: The temporary adop
tion of French war orphans and the chil
dren of war-maimed soldiers under the
Stars and Stripes plan received a fine im
petus last week when an infantry regiment
Avhich we are fortunate in being able to
designate more specifically as "an Ohio
regiment" took fifty-four mascots.
The regiment made a campaign for
francs which was directed by the chaplain
and two buck privates and forwarded a
cigar box full of more or less tattered paper
money. It was a generous offering. But
the money was gathered just after payday,
and we are assured that its collection didn't
impoverish any of the 3600 men concerned.
Yet it will provide comfort and education
for a year for fifty-four children at a critical
period in their lives, and appreciably lessen
the difficulties of many widowed mothers
and little brothers and sisters.
The memory of this Ohio regiment will
be cherished long in France.
ENTENTE AND TEUTONIC
RESOURCES
The entente allies excluding Russia and
including only those British dominions
which are self-governing and only the
United States proper have 11,000.000
square miles of territory, 303,000,000
people, and $495,000,000,000 of national
wealth.
The central powers have 1,250,000
square miles of territory, 147,000,000 peo
ple, and $134,000,000,000 of national
wealth.
The entente owe an aggregate debt of
$69,000,000,000, which is about 14 per
cent of their total assets. The central pow
ers owe $37,000,000,000, or 28 per cent of
their national wealth.

Attorney Leslie C. Hardy, of Hardy
& Hardy, of Nosales, who is recover
ing from his recent illness, will short
ly depart for California where he will
enjoy a visit by the sea. Mr. Hardy
is one of Arizona's brightest young at
torneys. He has a wide circle of
friends throughout the state who will
be glad to learn he is on the road to
complete recovery. j
It seems Arizona has suffered les3
from drouth during the last two years 1
lhan most parts of the Southwest.
While it has been very dry in mast
parts and grass has been very short, j
me percentage or came tnai uave mea
has been Hsht. One reason for this is
that Arizona has principally browse
ranges and when plenty of water and
salt is provided for the cattle there
are very small losses. Many of the
cattlemen realize this and wells are
being put down on most of the ranges.
Thirteen officers of the 302nd cav
alry have been ordered to Camp Per

the small arms firing school. The of

" W. B. Fonda, deputy cattle Inspector
for the Douglas district, was at Ber

day, where he went to inspect a shitv
ment of cattle made by the Glenn
brothers. The shipment amounted to
193 stock cattle and they were tfvhl
to F. N. Hall of El Taso. Mr. Fonrta
says that as a result of abundant rains
the country around Bernardino Is in
fine condition with abundance of grass
growing.
There is considerable speculation in
Cochise county as to the reason of
the government for sending . back
Capt. Harry Wheeler, former sher
iff of Cochise county who left for
overseas some time ago. The order
for his return came shortly after the
receipt of a telegram from him ac
cepting full responsibility for the I.
W. W. drive at Bisbee and some
think this Is the reason for his re
call. Others think that he is being
brought back to stand trial and
some believe that he is being brought
back at the. request of the defend
ants In the deportation cases as a
witness. He would be indespensibta
and valuable evidence would be lotf
were he to lose his life. There is cn
other repoit that he is being brought
back to organize defense units for the
border because of -his familiarity with
conditions.
On account of the shortage of wheat
the government is now taking steps
to get a check on every bushel of
whest threshed. L. L. Ijtythe. county
agricultural agent for Pima and Pinal

from She Washington office of the bu-!
reau of markets to provide every i
thresherman in his counties with rec
ord books and blanks upon which re

now working in the St. David section
are running the road in a new location

which will take the road in that local

now would always leave it exposed to

Louis Hohstadt and his eight year
old 6on, Robert, returned last night to
Douglas from a trip to the grand can
on and Williams, Ariz. At the canyon,
mornings and evenings, it was so cold
that overcoats were comfortable.
There were a large number of people
at the resort including perhaps fifty
automobile parties who were camping.
Robert shocked anu surprised his
father one morning by wandering
down Bright Angel trail with a photo
grapher and staying all day while M;
Hohstadt anxiously searched the trail
with the big telescope at the rim and
looked elsewhere for his adventurous
son. The latter returned at a o'cIcck
in the evening after having had a
swim in a pool supplied by water from
the Colorado river. That the biy did
some stunt is evident from the fact
that it is a seven-mile trip each way
down Bright Angel trail and the des
cent is 5UU0 feet. Most people pre
fer tc make the trip on mules and
many who attempt to walk it have to
be helped back on buircrs. A fourteen
mile hike with a 5000-foot drop in one
day is certainly quire an achievement
for an eight year-old hoy. Maybe ha

IN FIVE PARTS
SAN FRANCISCO MAN
SAYS IMPROVEMENT
IS JUSTWONDERFUL
Blake Declares Tanlac Has
Proven Better for Him
Than Health Resorts;
Friends Are Surprised at
Change
i
Like a vast forest fire, springing
from a single spark, the fame of Tan
lac has spread from a single testimon
ial given in its behalf a little more
than three years ago, until over Ten
Million bottles of the medicine have
bi-en sold and its praise Is now being
heard all over the United States and
Canada.
William L. Blake, a well known hotel
man, residing at 1767 Page street. San
Francisco, California, In telling of the
remarkable results he obtained from
the use of Tanlac, recently, said:
"About six years ago, I was unfor
tunate enough to have an attack of
ptomaine poisoning and since that
time I have never been able to eat any
thing, that didn't give me misery. Gas
would form on my stomach, causing
swelling and intense pain. I finally
gtot to where I was afraid to eat any
thing and lost nearly all my energy
and grew so weak and thin and un
comfortable, that I cojld not walk
without becoming ent.rely exhausted.
I was advised to go to the springs
In Lake county, which I did. I spent
quite a. while there, but did not get
any relief. No mrdicine had een
helped me and I didn't know ..hat 10
try next.
"On my return to San Francicco, 1
read several high endorsements on
Tanlac, and started taking it. Before
I had finished the first bottle, it had
begun to straighten me out. I kept on
taking It, until now I am able to ;at
just anything I want, pastry, solid
foods many things I haven't touched
for six long years. My nerves are in
better shape, my strength has come
back to me, 1 am in better condition
every way and am picking up all the
time. My improvement seems voudsr
ful to me, and even my friends are
surprised at the great change in rre
since I started taking Tanlac."
Tanlac Is sold In Bisbee by J. M.
Ball, in Douglas by Douglas Drug Co.,
in Paradise by G. A. Walker, in Bowie
by Bowie Drug Store, in San Simon bx
J. B. Cooke, in Willcox by A. A. Nichol
son, in Lowell by Lowell Drug Co., in
Benson by C. F. Moss Pharmacy, and
in Gleeson by B. A. Taylor. Adv.
just returned from El Paso where he
took the examination. He expects to
leave soon for San Antonio, Texas, to
report for duty. He was in the Spanish-American
war and had a commis
sion as captain and was in Cuba. He
has made several attempts to get Into
the present war but his age has kept
him back until he was accepted a few
days ago. His many friends in the dis
trict are glad to learn that he has suc
ceeded in getting ifnto the service. He
will be in the same. organization that
Chas. W. McKean of the C. & A. com
pany was given a commission a short
time ago. -There are a few others in
the district who will enter the same
organization.
PUGS GIVE BENEFIT
CPv Review Imaged Wire)
NEW YORK, July 16. Prominent
pugilists met in bouts at Madison
Square Garden tonight in a benefit to
buy athletic equipment for soldiers.
The feature bout, between Jack Demp

was called off as Dempsey sprained an

Packy McFarland of Chicago, gave a

WOMAN'S DEVOTION TO HOME,
Home duties to many women ap
pear more important than health. No
matter how ill they feel, they drag
themselves through their dally task,
overdo and pay the penalty in head
aches, backaches, dragging-dowr. pains
and nervousness; they become ir
ritable, and finally discover that some
form of female complaint has fastened
itself upon them. When a womau
gets into this condition there is one
tried and true remedy made from the
roots and herbs of the field, Lydia 3.
Pinkhara's Vegetable C o m p o u ad.
which, for more than forty years has
continued its great work among
women in restoring health after ntany
other remedies have failed. Adv.

BUY SUPPLY OF GOAL
FOR WINTER USE
AT ONCE, URGED
B. L. Smith, chairman of the Bis
bee fuel board, has issued the follow
ing statement:
"The state fuel administration for
Arizona has advised the local fuel
board that there' is a practical cer
tainty of a shortage of fuel during the
coining winter months, and it la cer
tain that there will be extreme diffi
culty in obtaining coal, with a proba
bility that It may be Impossible to do
so after the winter shall have set In.
It is therefore, urged upon the people
of Bisbee that everyone lay 'in their
coal now before the winter demands
make coal scorce.
"This should be dona first as a
patriotic duty to aid the government
in avoiding a freight blockade during
the coming winter, so that our war In
dustries may not suffer as they did
last winter, and second, to prevent
suffering In your families, .which will
be highly probable In the event sun
plies of coal are not provided early.
"Attention is called to the fact that
turing the freight blockade and coal
fauiina of last winter the fuel admin
istration adopted the policy of supply
ing coal for domestic use before di
verting it for other purposes, but in
sainuch as everyone has been constant
ly urged to buy coal during the sum
mer and have had ample no' ice of the
impending shortage, it is not probable
that such course will be pursued next
winter, but on the contrarv. it is prob
able that all coal required for the es
sential war industries will be firt
supplied and then If there Is any left it
will be assigned for domestic use for
those who have neglected to lay In
their winter supply. And if there Is
none left after supplying these essen
tial war industries, those who have
failed to provide their winter's fuel
may suffer.
"Th fuel administration also calls
attention to the use of lights, say Ins
that if display illuminations are not
kept within bounds and limited to the
hours of darkness, the suspension of
the so-called lightless nights order
will be revoked and even more string
ent restrictions will be ordered against
all forms of outdoor lighting."
"It is of the hlchest importance that
the people of Arizona comply with the
request of the Vnited State.9 fuel ad
ministration, because the state fuel
board has no cal mines within thWr
jurisdiction, and therefore cannot con
trol a sinele ton nf coal at the point '
of production and will be unable to
provide any community with fuel ex
cept with coal allotted bv th l'nl!d
States fuel administration: therefore
you should buy your coal now." j
