many's submarine raiders, which some
sixteen days ago made their first ap
pearance in American waters since the
declaration of war, apparently still are
ranging off the Atlantic coast, though
no reports of additional sinkings bad
been reecived at the navy department
late today to add to the official toll of
eiphteen craft sent to the bottom.
The last announcement from the de
partment concerning the operations of
the raiders came last night and told
of the sinking of the American steam
er Pinar Del Rio Saturday morning off
the Virginia capes. The master c a
Prazilian steamer arriving today at an
Atlantic port "said he had sighted a
submarine this morning seventy-five
mi'es off the New Jersey coast and
had seen an American transport open
fire on the U-boat, but at the depart
ment 'ate tonieht it was said no con
firmation of this encounter had been
received.
Two Crews Missing
Survivors of the Pinar Del Rio ar
riving at Norfolk said after they
abandoned their ship they sxw the sub
marine which sank the Rio send down
an American sailing vessel and a
schoner, but so far as known their
crews have not yet been landed and
the navy department said jit had no
reports to confirm these statements.
Observers here were not inclined to
agree with the theory of the Rio's
survivors that the vessel which they
saw near the submarine was a "moth
er" ship. They believed rather that
It probably was a freight steaaicr
which the raider had overhauled and
lcept within range of its guns with a
view of replenishing its stores at leis
ure before sinking the craft.
Even if the raiders are accompanied
hv a "mother" shiD, it was said the
latter vessel would hardly make its
appearance in the shipping lines where
it would be in imminent danger of
encountering the swift destroyers and
other patrols vigorously seeking the U
boats. Assuming that the raiders destroyed
the schooner Edna, immediately after
they arrived off the coast, officials
estimate that the raiders have been
away from their base now about 35
days and believe that they can remain
out some weeks longer by replenish
ing their stores and supplies from ves
sels which they sink.

held back the enemy just sufficiently

him.
Only at one point was the real
French line forced to recede and that
was in the neighborhood of Ilessons-Sur-Matz.

The headlines of the tournament in
cluded about half of the best boxers
in England, now all in khaki. Among
them were Sergeant Jimmy Wilde,
Sergeant Rolph of the Canadians, Sid
Burns. Corporal Billy Fullerton, and
several others whose names were well
known at the National Sporting Club
in pre-war days.
There were no purses, the prizes
being simple silver and bronze medals
worth abcut 15 each. Had the com
petition taken place at a London are
na and been open to the public, the
program would have been worth about
S25.000 to the promoters. But the pub
lic was not admitted, and the price of
admission to the soldier spectators
ranged from twelve cents to one dol
lar. The latter amount corresponded
to the $30 seats in the old days of the
National- Sporting Club in London.
There was an enormous attendance
cf officers and men, together with a
great many soldiers' families. It was
probably the first time in the history
of the ring in which men, women and
children attended a match of cham
pionship calibre.
Despite the keenness of the fighting
there was enly cne bout in which any
blcod flowed. The majority of the
men taking part were so physically
fit. owing to their military training,
that they were able to stand ur in the
ring and give and receive punishment
with a degree of fortitude seldom seen
in professional boxing meetings.
An impressive feature of the entire
comnetition. frcm the standpoint of
he American spectators, was the
-.Ti'.pulously strict and fair refereeing. I
Molding and clinching were stopped j
immediately, one warning only being
given. Any pair who stood up and en-j
gaeed in "shadow-fighting" also re-,
ceived a first and last caution, j
There were fourteen contests altogeth-i
er, each of six rounds. The Aldershot
Command won the meet, taking thir
teen of the fourteen events.
Commander Walcott, head of the
American branch of the British Ad
miralty Intelligence Department in
London, was the chief referee.
Cicero Martin, a summer res'dent c( j

a female cinnamon bear last Friday,

i spot and killed the mother bear and
two small cubs. When ho tried to
climb the tree in which he had fo.u.d

efforts. His small dog, which he
thought had been killed Friday, re
turned to the summer honi'? lata Sun

in search of burros. At the top of

ledge in which he thought iiii'!i l.e
mineral deposits. While looking ever
the ledge, in dense undergrowth, he
came on a bear.
Martin was armed with a pistol only.
He drew this, and fired point blank
at the animal a few yards awry. The
i bear sat up and licked its paw. Thfn
it charged. Martin climbed the tree
as the bear made snatches after him
When he had reached a safe plac-i he
again fired at the bear, this time hit

bear ran oft into the Underbrush, and
Martin discovered that the nialo ac
companied the female. He .Iii:iUl
down from his tree, went to his horo
and returned home.
Saturday morning Martin, accomp
anied by half a dozen others, includ-
ing Mrs. Martin, went again t ) the
head of Ramsey canyon. On this ttip
they were armed with rifles, and koivi
after reaching the head of Wiscoi'hin
canyon they jumped the fems'le bear.
When they had killed her they discov
ered the cubs, which were too iarge !c
capture. They also were killed.
Sunday Mr. Martin had on exhibition
at his home thn hides of the three
bears. The female weighed over 400
pounds and is one of the larges of
the type found in the Huachucas found
in recent years. Many visitors in tlia
canyon from the Warren district saw
the pelts.

THE LOYAL RED MAN.
From the Celeveland Plain Dealer:
Many criticisms have been made of the
Indian romances written by James Feni
more Cooper. His pet red men, like
Uncas and Chingachgook, were derided be
cause of their alleged heroism, their fidelty
and their sentimental acts. They were
called stage Indians and in every way un
true to nature. In England the Cooper ro
mances were accepted without serious
question. The Cooper Indians were looked
upon as the genuine article. Perhaps, in a
measure, our English cousins were wiser
than we were.
Anyway, there seems to be no question
of the Indians' loyalty and fidelty and
usefulness today. In every reservation
the first families of America are flying the
service flags. The red men have bought
liberally of Liberty bonds, they have given
freely to the Red Cross. There are In
dians in the National Army some of them
are in the trenches on the western front.
One of the reservation tribes offered its
famous peace pipe, a tribal heirloom, to be
sold to the highest bidder for the benefit
of the Red Cross.
That great awakening of loyalty and
service that is sweeping over the country
hasn't missed the red men.
THE TERRIBLE DEPTH BOMB.
Herman Whitaker in the Independent
New York : Of all the enginery of de
struction produced in the war, there is no
weapon more terrible than the depth
bomb. The explosion of one lifts a col
umn of water thirty yards wide fifty feet
above the sea. One that was discharged
nearly two hundred yards away from a
30,000-ton ocean liner heaved her up six
inches in the water. So terrible are they
that destroyers only drop them when run
ning at high speed to insure a "get-away, '
and even then the iron floor plates of the
boiler room are often lifted by the concussion.
Two significant headlines appeared in
the papers recently that will have a direct
bearing upon the war. One was the an
nouncement of a billion bushel wheat crop
and the other was the declaration that a
revision of the draft lists has been ordered
by the provost marshal. Wheat is an ally
of the allies. Germany must fight practi
cally without wheat. In a short dash this
might well not have much' effect, but in a
long race it is bound to play a vital part.
So a billion bushels of wheat go into the
scale against Germany this year from the
United States alone. The revision of the
draft lists means that thousands of exemp
tions and deferred classifications will be
recalled. . Uncle Sam wants men by the
hundreds of thousands and he wants them
right away. These two answers to the suc
cess of the last German offensive serve
notice on the rest of the world as to just
where this government stands at this phase
cf the war and as to just what part it will
play later in this mighty game. It is in
June of next year that the effect of these
answers will be really felt.
Along with its discussion of wars, state
politics, crime, progress and the problems
of humanity in general, this column would
wish at this time to say a word about the
C. & A. band cf this district. This hand has
inaugurated the pleasing custom of giving
a concert in the Warren park every Sunday
evening between the hours of 7 and 8
o'clock. Last Sunday some hundreds of
men, women and children assembled upon
the grass, the benches and in autos in close
rows about the fence, and enjoyed a won
derful hour. The bandstand is entirely
covered this year with vines. A cool
breeze blew frcm the mountains. Tie
music was soothing and helpful. Neighbors,
friends and sweethearts chatted together.
And the band played on. A good band is
a public institution and a benefit. It al
ways has troubles of its own. Member?
come ana go. W ork, business and sickness
intervene often between the bandsman and
his place in the parade or the bandstand.
But the public does not often think about
this side of it. One of the C. & A. band
bcys told the editor the other day that they
needed four or five additional members
light now. Any employer of help in the
district who needs a man ought to co-operate
with the band leader and hire, if pos
sible a man who can coax seductive strains
from a horn. Help the band, every chance
you get. That Sunday evening concert
al&ne is worth the price of admission to the
grand stand.the quarter stretch and the or
chestra circle.
The passing of Charles W. Fairbanks,
former vice president of the United States,
last week, attracted but little notice in the
press beyond the bare telegraphic an
nouncement of his fatal sickness and his
end. Yet Fairbanks was entitled to more
space than this. For fifteen or twenty
years he was a power in the republican
party and a leader of Indiana politics.
Twice he sought his party's nomination
for the presidency, and, holding always the
delegation from his own state, a pivotal
state, his candidacy was seriously consid
ered. But Roosevelt's influence the last
time gave the prize to William Howard
Taft. Fairbanks was not a popular or mag
netic leader. He was a conservative. He
was often referred to as the "human ice
berg." But he was a man of parts. Sane,
silent, substantial. His acts spoke louder
than his words. He had a keen and well
balanced mind and a capacity for hard
work. He sat always in high councils, but
was not an orator, hence lack of standing in
the popular mind outside of Indiana, where
his attainments were better known. But
for the fact that this nation is engaged in
a life and death struggle the passing of
Fairbanks would have engaged more at
tention from the country at large.
Government control of railroads has not
so far proved an unmixed blessing to the
general public, nor has it brought about that
Utopian dream of a perfect existence pre
dicted by the government ownership ora
tors of past and present years. In fact, the"
much muligned rule of the railroad manag
ers has been vindicated, in a sense, so far as
the public's dealings with railroads are con
cerned. Freight rates have been advanced
under government control arid so. have
passenger fares and Pullman rates.. All
trains have been taken off that were run
for the convenfence and comfort of the
traveling public, by the railroad managers,
rather than for profit. These rigid econo
mies are all explained and excused by the
assertion that they are war measures. And
no one is making complaint. Everything
to win the war goes. The greatest troop
movement ever known in the new world is
under way now and will doubtless continue
all summer. Freight and mail and passen
ger deliveries are slow, uncertain and hard
to be pleased with. But the war comes
first. However, there has been nothing so
far developed by government control of
railroads that would justify it or vindicate
it for a moment except a stern war neces
sity. ,
It is beginning to be more and more ap
parent, even to a landlubber in the mountain-bound,
desert-locked fastnesses of Ari
zona, that the Germans have a submarine
base somewhere on or just off the Atlantic
coast of the North American continent.
Else their submarines could not operate for
more than a day or two in these waters. Of
course the coast line, of this continent em
braces several thousand miles, and to find
this base is not an easy task. But it will
and must be found and destroyed. 1 his
submarine dash to America is only a flash
in the pan. It burned us, it is true, but it
accomplished no vital purpose in the Great
War..
A special correspondent, cabling from
France, declares: "in this difficult and crit
ical hour all eye3 are turned toward the
American troops which have already come
and those which are to follow. For every
body now agrees that if the allies are to
be saved at all it must be by American help.
And they are going to be saved. There are
over half a million American soldiers in
France now and there will be a million by
fall."
Some of the best known and most au
thoritative of the Paris military experts are
calling for a counter offensive. They argue
that the defensive style of fighting for the
past ten weeks has been a losing game and
that a mighty counter stroke is all that can
hold the aj!ied lines with three deep salients
extending into them at vital points.
Legislative Gossip
'
(.Special to The Hevlew)
Saturday afternoon in the house was
a splendid illustration of how a lef !
lalure ought not to behave. The young
St member of. the press gallery as he
mopped his brow in a sweltering at
mosphere, called it "a kangaroo ses
sion" and yearned for an overripe tev
mato when a member went too often
to the bat. It happened there wasn't
very much at issue. Under considera
tion iu the whole committee was Mrs.
Marsh's bill for the confiscation of
autos or other vehicles or means
whereby liquor might be brought into
Arizona. The author had told it was
a war measure, designed primarily to
protect the solciier jova in the board
er camps from a present flood of mor-a'e-destroying
squirrel whiskey. Yet
the house played horse with it for a
couple of hours before recommending
it for passage. The speaker took oc
casion to suggest that a glass of beer
might just hit the spot, considering the
temperature, winle Foster intimated
rat a well-regulated barkeep might
have social standing above the boot
leggers who now seem to clutter up
the highways. He acknowledged he
had accepted prohibition simply be
cause it seemed the will of the ma
jority, even though it had invaded the
.icjie. where he had seen the woman
of t he house celling booze. The chap
lain was permitted to tell a flivver
story that did not seem to bear intim
ately on the bill and there was grave
discussion whether burros might be
included in the "conscription of
wealth" involved. Johns said he had
been told by two superior court judges
that the bi!l is unconstitutional, be
sido being without the governor's call
Die original limitation of 200 miles
from "any military or naval establish
ment of the United States within the
State of Arizona" was extended to 100
milts and there was rare selt-restralnt
in a failure to consider the "naval"
feature. A couple of members thougnt
the fci 1 would discourage the passage
of trans-continental tourist travel, till
assured, on the word of an assistant
attorney general, that, the state could
have no jurisdiction on interstate
transportation, even of nightcaps for
auto drivers. Any money derived is
to "go to the counties.
Stnator Hall's last legislative action
was, 'Move we adjourn. It was
brought out by a half hour or mor9
of ante mortem inquest into his many
personal pnd ro itical per.ections. with
about all of his colleagues joining in
an oratorical rendition of, "For he's a
jolly good fellow." Hall already had
acknowledged a delightful presenta
tion speech made by Winsor and had
told that lie was g;au to go to France,
pcssil.ly "to make the world safe for
the democratic par;y, and assuredly to
he'p in making the world safe for
Arizona labor ?nd even for Arizona
capital." Rutherford had offered him
a tribute of poesy and Claridge one of
mere rhyme, the latter taking well in
its hope that an Irish kaiser soon
wou'd sit on Berlin's throne. The dem
ocratic members agreed that Hall ha-1
bundnnt bravery, even fcolhardiness,
n sitting as a republican in Arizona's
legislature. Then, on the motion of
Hall's colleague. Wilkinson, the at
taches, constituting "the third house,"
v.cer instructed to secure a proper
service flag on which the senate might
proudly display its single star.
In a bill that comes from the adju
tant general's offices. Johns has takea
to the house !. material modification of
the high school military training act.
The statute makes training compul
sory, tut without a penalty. . If the
new bill passes, any school that fails
to obey shall he cut off from state
funds. The cadets must be uniformed
jnd there shall be a company in any
schcol wherein are fifty or more boys
above the age of 14. In such schools
one of the instructors shall be a per
son capable of giving such instruc
tion. The socialistic members of the house
ior several days past have managed to
fight eft' a vote on the anti-loafing bill,
which bad been reported back without
iecommendation from the committee
on labor. Primarily, they have stated
their objection as being that the bill
was aimed at the masses, rather than
the classes and that conscription of
wealth should be included in the con
scription of labor, that only asset of
the poor man. Johns, Cureton. Green
and others tried to show that the bill
plays no favorites and is intended par
ticularly to clear the park benches and
pool rooms of idlers, many o them
vicious, and to help In securing a bad
ly needed labor supply. The objec
tions usually are founded on assertions
of tiie loftiest patriotism, hut a!l clear
ly are designed to kill the measure,
which has been under a process ot be
ing talked to death in a long-drawn-
out sessions of the committee of the
whole. The supervisors of Coconini
countv have sent an approving men
ace concerning the bill.
Senator Rutherford, thinking of the
governor s message, said trial eiguty
citizens of Jerome had been called to
help in getting the city's quota of sol
diers off to the war in proper shape.
Only two of those called had failed
to "respond, by name, Branson and
Waldroop. The latter is the man whose
tarring-and feathering especially wa
objected to in the message.
A house bill by Houser that calls
for the Knwish language from all men
employed in railroading and mining
lia had some consideration by a com
mittee of the conservative Mexican so
cletv. la Una I'rotectora l-stim.
which has strong re presentation local
ly in a counc il of defense branch that
.as just turned over $1,000 to the Red
Crc:ss as the financial results of a p
triotic celebration. There seems little
liklihood of passage; o! the bill.
Introduced by Fluke, the house has
a new joint resolution calling for a
referendum of the anti-capital punish
ment measure. It is simple and is tm
elerslofid to have been drawn by the
attorney general's office, with full as
surance tlt.it it would stand a test ot
the courts, something that had been
feared in the senate, in which a sim

VauAin has a new soldiers' voting
bill, a substitute for house bill 3. It
abolishes the voting commissi:1!! and
puts the machinery in the hands of
the supervisors of the several coun
ties.
In the senate the present speciil
session is called "The Kesolutionary
War." Winsor observed that "knock
ing the stuffing out of the I. W. W.
has been the most popular indoor sport
while the kaiser must need a gas mas!
to withstand the Arizona cloud of pa
triotic resolutions."
In consideration ol cne senate sol
diers' right3 bill. Wilkinson had added
a section exempting ail persons ia mil
itary service from poll or schcol tax
and from taxation of joint property of
himself and wife that is assessed at
$3,000 or les3.
Representative Walton states he did
not have the Bisbee people in view
when he spoke of taxpayers who yet
were criminals. He referred to sever
al alien enemies convicted in Arizona
lately. In fact, he believes mast of
the convictions for disloyalty iu this
state have been of taxpayers.

ANNOUNCES HIMSELF
AS OUT FOR SHERIFF
In another column of this issue will
be found the announcement of William
S. Brakfield,. better konwn to his many
friends in the coulity as "Billie" Brak
field, of his candidacy for the nomi
nation for the office of sheriff subject
to the action of the voters at the
Democratic primary to be held on Sep
tember 10th. Mr. Brakfield has been
a resident of the county for over six
teen years. When he first came to
the county he was engaged in the cat
tle business in the Sulphur Springs
valley and later in the San Pedro val
ley. He was at one time a member
of the county rangers and as such
made a record in ridding the county of
the numerous cattle thieves that in
fested it at that time. For the past
four years he has been acting as a
deputy sheriff at Lowell and is well
known throughout the district. In
making his announcement he states
that he is standing on his record as an
officer and is willing to submit to the
will of the voters that record in asking
for their support.
. Mr. Brakfield is qtlite well know
throughout the county and is known to
the majority of the residents of the
Warren district, and there Is no doubt
but that he will make a good race for
the nomination of sheriff on the demo
cratic ticket. He is married and ha3
j-roperty interests in the district.

Reply to Hunt
The Clifton Man Brings the
Governor Back to Main
Point at Issue in Another
Open Letter That Strikes
Homes and Spares Not
The Hon. Geo. W. P. Hunt,
Governor of Arizona,
Phoenix, Arizona.
My Dear Governor Hunt:
I have received your letter of June
4th, in which you comment upon my
open letter addressed to yourself upon
the subject of your recent message to
the Legislative.
In the initial paragraph of your let
ter you charge me with re-opening a
subject, the discussion of which at this
time would appear peculiarly untime
ly; Judging by the reception which my
letter received throughout the state,
you are certainly entitled to say that
it is untimely, but for whom?
Your reply characteristically and
adroitly sidesteps the main issue and
seeks to divert public attention from
it.
My letter did not re-open the con
troversy which led to the strike in the
Cllfton-MorencI district in 1915. I of
fered no justification for the attitude
of the companies relative to their em
ployees at that time, nor did I bring
any charges against the employees
relative to their attitude toward their
employers. These are old wounds
which I had no desire to re-open, and
it would be far from my intention to
say anything now which would disturb
the cordial relations which have ex
isted between the majority of the work
ers in this district and the officers ot
the companies since that distressful
time, a relationship which I earnestly
hope will be strengthened and built
up. I do not believe that the public is
at all interested at this time in a repe
tition of the history of that strike, or
In a discussion of the points which
were at issue, and while you gave be
a tempting opening to "take you down
the line" on thas subject. I will spare
the patience of the public and your
feelings, and will only touch upon
those matters particularly referred to
by you In this connection.
The occurrences to which I had ref
erenc had nothing to do with the caus
es of the strike, but had solely to do
with the relationship between one
one group of strikers and another, and
with a condition of mob law and vio
lence which existed in the district dur
ing a period lasting over several
months.
In your message, after describing
with lurid literary vividness, presum
ably, of course, without exaggeration,
the Bisbee deportations on June 1?,
1917, you asked the questsion, "Can
this dastardly crime be equalled any
where in the revolting annals of labor
disputes?" I answered that question
and that answer cannot be successful
ly refuted. . .
It matters not what the nerlU of the
controversy were, nor would It matter
were the various charges and insinua
tions contained In your letter in ac
cordance with the facts. Tho point
now is that what you define as a "dat
tardly crime" had been equalled, yea,
far outdistanced, in this Btate atid

(under your own administration; and
j waiving aside any iDsiiiua,:on of COn-
tions carried on during tho months of
October, November -and December.
1915. (I will leave that to your own
conscience). he fact remains that with
all the power necessary at your com
mand you did not stop th.in.
You cannot pull the wool over the
eyes of the public by setting up a man
of strow and knocking him down, or by
disporting yourself amid irrelevant
matters.
Stick, to the point. Governor. Can
you deny that the deportations I refer
to did take place in the Clifton-Mor-enci
district under your own adminis
tration.
Can You Deny?
Can you deny that these deporta
tions were carried out with a barbar
ity unequalled in the 'revolting annals
of any labor dispute in this state?
Can you deny that you were aware
that unlawful deportations were being
carried out in the Clifton-Morencl dis
tricts?
Can you deny that you did not put
a stop to them?
I ask you whether teh perpetrators
of these outrages were company thugs
and gunmen, or were they men wear
ing hat bands bearing the motto "Hur
rah for Governor Hunt?"
Can you deny that you have at all
times failed to call the attention of the
legisalture to them, and have failed or
refused to recommend or secure legis
lation calculated to prevent their repe
tition? If you presume to deny any of the
above facts, then it will be my un-!
pleasant duty to expose before the eyes-
of the public a full statement of facts
connected with these deportations in .
the Clifton-Morencl district, continued i
throughout the months of October, No- j
vember and December, 1915, and other j
facts proving that lawless conditions ;
continued in this district during that
time, and that while Governor during '
all that time, with channels ot accurate
information open to you, and untram-1
melted in your power, you failed to 1
take the necessary steps to put a stop
to these atrocities, and you failed to ,
have the laws of the state upheld, and
that you failed to have peace and order
maintained.
The mere statements of certain Indi
viduals that they were not molested is
but a puerile and totally inadequate
defense.
Were You Present at Bisbee?
You question my aathority to ac
curately describe the Clifton-Morencl
deportations because I did not myself
witness them; May I respectfully ask
if you were present at the Bisbee de
portations, which you describe with
such blood-curdling details, or how di1
you get your information?
Stepping aside with you for a ma
ment to discuss the immaterial and
Irrelevant matters introduced by you
for the obvious purpose mentioned
earlier In this letter.
You reier to the ignominious flight
of the managers and their residence
in another state. I have no doubt that
our action caused wou chagrin, as our
escape to a state where life unmolested
was possible, called public attention to
the obstacles to peace obtaining under
your regime, and denied you the cor
templated pleasure and satisfaction of
incarcerating ue as your guests at pub
lic expense in a place where, like
criminals, we would have been sub
ject to gubernatorial visitations with
cut recourse to the proiectcion of th
law.
But why Ignominious? Is it not as
honorable to ride on a lemtive as in a
private care?
If . you were in goal and wanted to
Department
escape, would yon consider it igno
minious to get out through the win
dow if you couldn't get out through t!ie
door?
Does not the very manner of your
going reflect discreditability not up
on the mangers but upon the lawless
conditions obtaining in the district at
the time, under which pear-able citi
zens were not permitted to come and
go as they pleased; does not this fai t
alone cast back in your teeth your in
sinuation that my description of con
ditions was exaggerated?
You refer to your executive policy
at that time, and again you take to
yourself the credit for having pre
vented the introduction of hired
strike-breakers and would-be assassins
into the Clifton-Morencl district, w.wn
all the time the public knows, and
you know yourself that there never
was any attempt made by the com
panies to do any of those things; In
fact, the very reverse, for the man
agers, acting upn instructions from
headquarters, publicly announced at
the outset that no attempt would be
made to operate, no strike-breakers or
gunmen would be introduced, and
thi9 policy was str'.riiy adhered to
thrcughcut. Nay, more, did not the
managers, being denied the common
right under the law of prviding their
own watchmen to protect their com
panies' property, accept the conditions,
imder auress and meek'.y turn every
thing over to the sheriff and p.iy him
large sums of money for guarding it.
for the very object of avoiding came
for disorder or violence? And anv
credit for the fact that no bloody mas
racre occurred, the possibilities of
which you apprehended, wa3 due not
so much to any precautionary meas
ures which you Inaugurated, as to the
policy announced and practiced by the
companies, and because these man
agers withdrew themselves and staff?
from the neighborhood so that no color
could be given to any rumor that ihc
intended to try to break the strike,
hence in laying the flattering unction
to your soul that your policy prevented
the companies from doing certain
things they themselves had publics
announced they would under no cir
cumstances do, you clothe yourself m
peacocks'feathers and place a halo
round your head, to which the fa?ts
do not entitle you.
Real Farts of 1915 Strike
These facts were never ascertained
by the "impartial investigators" who
visited the district and who wrote up
your story in certain easetrn maga
zines and ournals. Investigators who
showed their impartiality by neglect
ing to ascertain the companies' side
of the case, nence they couid enly re
peat that catching refrain about a
wonderful governor who would not
permit certain people to do what those
people had previously and continuous
ly declared they had no desire or in
tention of doing.
If ever there was a labor dispute in
which the employers used every pos
sible means to avoid giving cause for
bloodshed or disturbance the 1915
strike in this district was that one,
while imported agitators, uninterfered
with, were addressing the strikers,
advocating taht they seize and strins
up the managers.
As far as peace and quietness in
thlst district were concerned, the con
trast between conditions during the
1915 strike aiid those which obtained
throughout the three month's strike
of last year, when another was gov
ernor, certainly does not reflect very
creditably on the manner in which you
gave effect to the policies of which
you boast.
You refer with condemnatory em
phasis to our refusal to arbitrate, a.
most, misleading statement. What we
did do was at the very outset to state

HEAVY RAINS ASSURE
RELIEF TO STOCKMEN
iN STRICKEN AREAS
DALLAS, Texas, June 10. The long
drought which has prevailed in West
Texas for two or more years, causing
little less than disaster to the cattle
raising industry of Texas, has been
partly If not wholly broken. Three !
good, soaking rains fell in that dts-'
trict within the first seventeen days
of May. Grass is now coming out,
water holes have been partly filled !
and a general spirit of optimism pre
vails with the cattlemen, many of ;
whom staked fortunes on the effort to j
hold out.
Ranchmen, who had waited from
month to month for the rains shipped
thousands of cattle out of this district
to other ranges. Many dollars we're
spent by tiie stockmen on feed to keep1
alive those few cattle that remained
on the ranges. They declare that had j
the rain been delayed another six i
weeks, the plains of Texas would have !
been practically deserted of cattle.
All of Texas west of a line drawn I
north and south through San Antonio i
constituted the drought district, prac
tically all of which is devoted to the !
cattle raising industry. Part of the
district, however, contains some agri- j
cultural land, devoted mostly to truck j
farming.' Little cotton or corn is j
grown.
The' drought began in some sections
late in the summer of 1U14, and almost
ever since the cattlemen have had a
fight on their hands to save the herds i
with which the ranches were populat- j
ed at that time. In 1915 the situation i
grew more serious and the rainfall j
was far below normal. Early in 1916
a large part of the district had fair ;
rain, hut thprn wprp Til nn v lar areas I
w hich had none and others where the
rain fell so rapidly that it did
little
good. Throughout the summer ot
1916, all through 1917 and well into .
1918 conditions grew steadily worse, j
Pioneers of West Texas declare it J
was the worst dry spell that has fall- j
en over that section in a century. Dust j
storms which swept the section a few I
weeks prior to the rains were the ;
worst and most severe experienced in
a generation. In San Angelo the lul .
storm was so severe that all outside ,
work had to be suspended and the sky
was so dark that it was necessary to ,
use electric lights for indoor work. :
A general influx of cattle which had ;
been shipped out of West Texas is ex- j
pected to begin soon. Cattlemen, how-:
ever, point out that it will require '
years to stock the ranches as before "
the drought Jiit the 'ranges.
CAPITOL ADDITION

state veterinarian w ill have two rooms
and the sheep sanitary commission i-t

NO OLD MATTER.
Postmaster Bailey wishes to impress
on people that it is useless to put

trmd. Some neop'e have been acting
on the supposition that any magazines,
no matter how old, is acceptable for
sending to soldiers at the cheap rate
and they have been wasting postage.
as tti government will not mail such
matter.
