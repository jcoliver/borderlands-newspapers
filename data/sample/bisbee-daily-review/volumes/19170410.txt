Seizure of Ships Expected To Be Interpreted As Act of War
By Austria, and Soon Bulgaria and Turkey Also Are To
Align Actively Against U. S. Switzerland Takes Over
American Interests In Austria.
(By Review Leased Wire.)
WASHINGTON, April 9. Austria-Hungary, ranging
herself unreservedly with Germany, has severed diplomatic
relations with the United States, precipitating a situation
which generally is expected here to lead to war.
Baron Erich Zwedinik, the Austrian charge d'affairs,
asked the state deDartment today for passports for himself, his
staff and th Austrian consular force in this country; and'
simultaneously American Minister Stovall reported from
Berne that Austria had announced the break in relations to
the American embassy in Vienna yesterday.
- j , Ships Seized As Act of War.
Immediately the treasury department ordered the seizure
of all Austrian merchant ships in American harbors. The
Austrian crews were taken off and sent to immigration sta
tions and American guards put on board. The measure was
explained as purely one of precaution, but it is realized that it
may be interpreted by Austria as an act of war.
Bulgaria to Split Too
Whether Bulgaria and Turkey are
preparing to - follow suit still is un- J
v known- tour officials generally believe
that sooner or later they will do so,
Bulgariac Minister PansrefofT called l
Vn Secretary Lansing late uxlay to
ask if this government had any infor
mation from Sofia, but was told none
had been received. Both Bulgaria and
Turkey are believed here to be weary
of the war; but German domination of
the centra European alliance is ex
pected to drive them; as It drove Aus
tria, to break with Germany's new
enemy.

AUSTRIAN SHIPS AND
CREWS HELD III II. Y.
BY U.S. AUTHORITIES
(By Review Leased Wire.)
XEW VORK. April 9. Four Aus
trian ships, one or them a passenger
liner, that have been self-interned
here since the beginning of the war,
were seized by custom officials to
day acting under instructions from
Washington. The officers and crews
of the ships, numbering in all 68 men
were interned at Ellis Island.
The four ships seized were the pas
senger steamer Martha Washington,
8.212 tons, built in 1908; Ida. 4.720
tons, built in 1906; Dora. 7.037 tons,
built in 1913, and the Himalaya, 4.938
tons, built in 1910. Hurried examina
tion of the vessels led the officials to
believe that none of them had been
damaged seriously.
The comparatively few men found
on board is accounted for by state
ments that some of the crews had
been discharged.
An unconfirmed report in marine
circles was that negotiations between
the American Steamship company and
owners of the four ships looking to
their purchase hpd been under way
for some weeks, and that If permitted
the purchase might now be consummated.

BOSTON
End Brings Relief To Long
Severe Sufferings of Former
Secretary of State Under
Cleveland.
(By Review LeaseC Wire)
; BOSTON, April 9 Richard Olney,
statesman, once secretary of state and
always a noted student of internation
al affairs, died at his home in the
Fenway, in the Back Bay district at
8:45 o'clock last night. Word of the
passing of the great citizen was not
gi"n to the public until today.
The end came after a protracted pe
riod of intense suffering which failed
to shake the courage that marked his
82 years. .
Richard Olney served successively
as attorney general and secretary of
state during the administration of
President Cleveland, and although at
the head of the state department for
the short period of one year and nine
months only, he won reputation as a
statesman of commanding ability and
force. His greatest triumph was his
successful insistence upon arbitration
of the boundary dispute between
Great Britain and Venezuela.
Imperturbly disregarding the warn
ings that a rigid maintenance of the
Monroe Doctrine might plunge the
United States into war with Great
Britain, President Cleveland and Sec
retary Olney carried out their own
ideas of diplomacy. In his famous
message sent through Ambassador
Bayard to Lord Salisbury, British sec
retary of state for foreign affairs. Mr.
Olney, premising the Inalienable right
of the United States to intervene in
questions affecting the territorial in
tegrity of South American countries,

representatives and senators with
whom he had conferred before regard
ing the issue. J. P. Morgan, in Wash
ington on other business ror a few
hours, paid a five minute call on Mr.
McAdoo. The bond issue was dis
cussed incidentally, it was said, and
Mr. Morgan remarked that he thought
the country was in a condition readily
to absorb a large issue.
Here's Program
Mr. McAdoo's formal announcement
Of the program, made at the conclusion
of a day of conferences, reads as fol
lows: "The administration will ask con
gress for authority to issue $5,000,0oil,
000 dollars of government bonds to
meet the situation created by the war
with Germany. The proposed bonds
will be exempt fiOm taxation and bear
interests probably at three and one
half per cent per annum. Two billion
dollars of these bonds will be required
to finance, in part, the expenditures
involved in the proper organization
and preparation of the army and navy
and the conduct of the war generally.
Of course, a large amount of addition
al revenue will have to be raised by
taxation, but this part of the problem
is under consideration by the ways
'and means committee of the house of
representatives. It mill naturally take
a reasonable time to discuss and agree
upon the new items for taxation,
which should not and. I am confident
will not become the subject of par
tisan treatment.
Three Billion to Allies
"Three billion dollars of the pro
posed issue of the bonds should be
used to supply credit to the govern
ments making common cause with us
against German to enable them to se
cure essential supplies in the Tnited
States and carry on the war with in
creased effect.
"The most serviceable thing we can
do immediately for the common cause
is to furnish credit to these i foreign
governments, who in conjunction with
us are fighting Germany. This finan
cial aid ought to he extended at the
earliest possible moment. It will be
trebly valuable and effective if extend
ed now.
"The purpose is to purchase the ob
ligations of the foreign governments
to which credit is given euch obli
gation to bear the same rate of inter
est. and in other essentials, to con
tain the same terms and conditions as
the bonds of the United States.

NEW YORK. April 9. The many J
disturbing features of the past week!
were ausmented today by additional
unfaviyyble crop reports, arratie and
spectacular movements in the com
rpoffilel markets and announcement
of Shstria's rupture with this govern
ment. Early quotations wore mainly
higher, but these gains were largely j
in the nature of short covering, the j
market losing all its advantage in the
general liquidation of the last liour. j
Banking interests expressed dis
appointment at the absence of defi
nite advices from Washington regard
ing prospective government issues .
and the question of taxation. i
Exchange markets strong and active.
During the forenoon U. S. Steel and
various other industrial of the same
class, as well as munitions und equip
ments made gains of 2 to 4 points.
Shippings and metals were less re
sjKmKive hut strong. Rails were hea
vy. Total sales CS.".,oOu shares.
. The heaviness of stocks extended
to the bond list, numerous domestic
issues receding from half a point to
a full point, but the international
group was strong. Total sales, par
value, t6.450.000. In government
bonds the only feature was a two
point advance in the coupon fours on

ing -Anew today the high price record,
wheat values had a severe break due
largely trt realizing by holders who
believed that the government report
showed the winter crop at the worst
stage and that some improvement had
taken place. Heavy calling of mar
gins tended further to increase bear
ish sentiment as did talk of govern
ment measures to stop speculation iu
foodstuffs. Fluctuations which cover
ed an extremely wide rane, as much
sr. 10 cents in some cases, were fol
lowed by an unsettled close at net
losses of 3 to 5'4. with May at 2.16
to 2.07, and July at 1.84 i to 1.85. Corn
finished it3!) to 4 down and oats off
l1) to. 23 at 24. but provisions up
12. to 32 cents. j
At 'first crop reports, especially i
from Kansas, were of a continued
pessimistic character. About the mid
die of the session, sellers began to be
in a decided majority, and from that
time on the market was on the down
grade, veil onlv brier transient ral
lies. ' ... . j
A: ide from somewhat more hopeful :
winter crop reports, there was late ;
gossip of a possible huge increase of 1
spring wheat seeding. The posting ,
of doines'ic visible supply figures ;
showing a big falling off in the total .
available stock had only a temporary .
;effect.
, Corn, like wheat, reached new top '

Oats, merely duplicated in a restricted
way the action of other cereals.
Fresh top notch quotations on hogs
were reflected by provisions. De

The fighting on Villy ridge was car

during the day three German battal

Surprised Germans.
It was said everywhere along the
attacking line that the Germans ap
peared to have been taken by surprise
and only in a few instances did they
put up a strong light. One reason for
this was that they had been fairly
duzed by the British artillery fire of
the last ten days.
Guns By Thousands.
From the high ground overlooking
Arras a panoramic view of many miles
of the British attack was presented.
The concentration of guns for fills
operation probably was the greatest ;
for a given amount of front since thej
war began. Almost countless guns
had taken pan In the bombardment
since the beginning but it was nut
until last night that niany maskid
batteries joined in the grim chorus.

FLAGS AND BREWERY GULCH.
Just why Alain Ktreet should have, to a greater or less
extent, a monopoly on the flying of flags above places
of business is a matter of much conjecture. Sunday
afternoon thousands of loyal, patriotic Americana march
ed from two ends of the Warrent District, to the city
park. They marched through Brewery Gulch and the
thing they noted was the bareness of the business
houses of anything which would indicate their affilia-'
tion with such a country as the United States.
A letter, addressed to the Review on this subject, sev
eral days ago, is particularly applicable at this time.
"Have you ever noticed how very conspicious our old
"Brewery Gulch' is'by the absence of Old Glory from the
following places: Busy Bee, Cafe Odeon, Tirol Store,
. Royal Confectionery, New Edelweiss, Uncle Jim's, St.
Elmo, French Kitchen and several- other places along
that famous old thoroughfare.
"At this particular time I have wished that I had the
power to make them respect, and also to display, the
stars and Stripes.
"For, almost by their display you shall know them."
The writer of the letter is unknown to the Review
His sentiments, however, are exactly ours. We would
delight in his appointment as the custodian of the dis
playing and the respecting of Old Glory. We feel that
the flag of our country be would properly handled, under
his direction.
On the other hand it is hardly just to condemn all
because they -have not displayed- their flags. Some have
no flags and have forgetten to purchase. Others have
legitimate excuses with which the general public is, un
doubtedly, unacquainted On the whole, however, there
is yo excuse for not flying the colors of the United
States and the more so when the proprietors of busi
nesses are natives of countries whose interests at the
present time, are Inimical to those of the United States.
BETTER ROADS.,
Recent announcement was made through the columns
of the Tombstone Prospector that the Cochise Tax Pay
ers' Association has decided to get behind a bond issur
which would provide for a road from Rodeo, New Mexico
to the western line of the county One of the greatest
needs of the state's largest and most prosperous county
is at last, in all probability, to receive actual attention.
The proposed bond issue is to be voted for under a law
passed by the last state legislature, known as House
Bill 175. AH of its provisions are not known in detail
but some of them distinctly aid in the promotion of better
roads in the various counties.
In the first place the proposed bond issue would enable
the people of Bisbee and Douglas to pave part of the road
between the two large centers of the county. The bond
issue, after being voted and sold, would be under the
control of a commission of five men, appointed by the
board of supervisors. An interesting thing, in connec
tion with these commissioners, is the fact that they
sene without salaries. It is not likely, in consequence,
that some perfectly good balloonists will be put on the
board to supervise the building of good roads.
Douglas and Bibbcc should, at once, get behind the
project of paving the road between the two cities. The
condition of the road Is worse than rotten. It is nearly
impossible for anythiug of a permanent nature to be
done alone the lines of improving the oresent system or
. - - . - - ,
roads. The highway must be paved and the drainage
system must be greatly improved to take care of the
water which occasionally falls on the western slope of t'lvi
Sulphur Springs Valley.
"SCOOPS."
Time was when "scoops" were the order of the day
in newspaper work. That time has, practically speaking,
passed. When a news story "breaks" in afternoon time
it is sent to every newspaper in the country having day
wire connections. This also applies to stories which
break during the night for morning wire connections.
For an Arizona newspaper to cry "scoop" consequently
and it, a morning paper, is rather laughable.
, It is the Yuuia Sun. It is a four page paper. The
plant probably has one linotype. Here is what is nays
editorially:
"As evidence of the superior newspaper service given
by the Morning Sun it is only necessary to state that yes
terday morning this paper contained the vote and full
and complete particulars of the passage of the war re
solution by the house, and the vote was not taken until
three o'clock at night. Washington time. Other morning
papers of the 6th reaching our desk, notably the Tucson
Star, contained only the information the house was
"likely to pass" the resolution before morning. After
noon papers Thursday bad absolutely no news wort'j
printing on the subject. Just as the Sun said in a recent
editorial comparing afternoon with morning papers, the
afternoon papers both Wednesday and Thursday, when
the war resolution was pending in the senate and house,
respectively, could only give a "snatched" liner item
that the measure was up for dissension. The Wednes
day night news, and details of the passage of the resolu
tion in the senate, with the vote, was printed In the Sun
Thursday morning. The great big afternoon "greased"
wire papers failed, as usual, to get the news until it was
twelve to twenty-four hours late, while the smaller after
noon dailies with the little seventy-five or one hundred
word service were the veritable jokes they always are
in a news way.
"The Morning Sun's tremendous scoop in two of the
biggest news itemB published in- this country since the
Civil War declaration, is only in line with its daily grind
of scoops. And these scoops are not against the smaller
country dailies (for we do not consider them even men
tionable in the same breath with the Sun in this regard),
but they were scoops against such papers as the Tucson
Star with what it calls its great leased wire A. P.
service.
"It is the same old story, to get the news when it is
news, and to get all the news and the details of all the
news in Yuma. Either this or live in the dead past."
It is a fact, not generally admitted by morning news
papers, that the afternoon press has the greatest number
of "breaks" of news. The great part of the news of the
world occurs in the day light hours. Conseqquently, the
afternoon newspapers have first chance at the stories.
The morning papers follow with the stories in more de
tail and supplement the fast handling of the first in
stance with accurate work of the later editions.
In the case of the Yuma Sun, it Is to laugh. It seems
funny that every paper in the state, not having a leased
wire service from the Associated Press, should 'hoot' it.
Witness the "Sun. Apparently, the Sun does not know
that some papers get out mail editions. Apparently the
Sun, published somewhere along the Colorado River, does
not know that the Arizona Star has such an edition. We
are holding no brief for the Star but we would venture
the assertion hat the Star's home edition bad the result
of the house's action in detail. Every other paper on the
Associated Press 'leased' wire in the state, for the
morning report, received the report, including the Star.
It was received, however, too late for any mail editions.
The Yuma Sun is such an imposing newspaper: its
array of news, not credited to any news agency; its won
derful editorial columns, its four, bright, big, promising,
gifted pages, and its undoubted influence in Yuma, is
envied. We wish we could talk ourselves into any such
a state of auto intoxication as prompted the reprinted

WOMEN'S CLUBS AND CONSERVATION
One of the big things women's clubs throughout the
country have been doing Js cleaning p and beautifying
their communities. We find them fighting billboard nui
sances, organizing movements for attractive and clean
back yards and supporting every effort for making their
towns more pleasant and wholesome places to live in.
The Federated Women's Clues of Iowa are fulfilling
this mission on a large scale for the beauty spots of their
state. They have started a campaign for the conserva
tion of the natural scenery of Iowa. It is to be their
big work for 1917. V
The federation numbers 19,000 members. Through
them and associated clubs the campaign will be carried
i
into every city and town in the state.
Leaders have been put in each of the eleven congres
sional districts of Iowa. They form a committee whose
work will be to study the natural scenery of the state,
to arouse sentiment for the conservation of the beauty
already there and to urge the establishment of recreation
parks. Roadsides will be beautified. Waste land along
the important motor highways will be converted into
attractive landscapes and resting places.
Most of us approve of such work. We want our com
munity, our state and our country to be beautiful. But
we need to be pushed a little before we do anything about
it. More power to the women's clubs that are doing the
pushing!

a company of Reserve Signal Troops
in the Territory covered by the corn

quired will be nominal In time of
emergency every maie citizen is liable
for military service and the Mountain
States company believes its employes
prefer to render their military service
along the lines of their telephone ex

who volunteer will be required. Those
who are not, will also have a patriotic
service to perfornf in keeping open
the channels of telephone communica
tion throughout the country. Enlist
ment in the Signal Reserve Company
is entirely voluntary on the part of
the employes of the Mountain States
company. The company is interested
in seeing that the employes who de
sire to volunteer for military service
arte placed where they cun best serve
the country.

ized as u unit of the Signal Corps
Reservei will be charged with the pro
viding of semi-permanent telephone or
telegraph systems from brigade or di
vision headquarters to higher head
quarters, orto the base of operations
Telephone men are expected to learn
that service in this company will
prove invaluable in serving their country'-
A telegraph company will be
commanded by a capiani and made
up of the following: Two master sig
nal electricians: seven first-class ser
geants: 11 sergeants; 17 corporals;
2 cooks; 49 first-class privates and
12 enlisted men. The equipment will
consist of eight motor trucks and 11
motorcycles. Each company will be
divided int two plautoons, commanded
by a first lieutenant, and each platoon
will be sub-divided into two sections.
The section is the working unit in tbe
company organization.
Summer Training
The term of enlistment in the Sig
nal Reserve Corps is four years. Ap
plicants must be citizens 'ot the United
States or must have declared their in
tention to become such, and be from
18 to 45 years old. The regular army
physical examination will be made be
fore applicants can be enlisted. In
time of peace the reserve corps will
be given 15 days' "held training each
summer. Signal companies of the reg
ular army will instruct the reserve
corps. The men will be called for this
service so as to interfere as little as
possible with the regular work of the
telephone company. The Mountain
States Telephone and Telegraph Com
pany w ill grant leave of absence with
full pay to any employe who is ac
cepted as a member of the reserve,
and this absence will not curtail any
vacation to which the employe may be
regularly entitled under the general
rules of the company.

Transportation to and from the
summer camp of instruction will be
furnished by the government, with al
lowance for meals during the journey.
While at the camp subsistence and all
necessary uniforms and equipment will
be furnished by the government and

cordance with their rank and work in

ties the Signal Reserve Corps may be
called into service by the President as
part of the regular army.

Jose Andrado Is Arrested On
Charge of Assault With a
Deadly Weapon Within
Short Time After Trouble
In Tin town. '
Jose Andrade is held in the Lowell
jail awaiting preliminary examinatitn
on a c!iarge of assault with a deadly
weapon as the result of a cutting af
fray at Tintown late Sunday night.
His alleged victim. Celso Orozco, la
lying seriously wounded at his home
in Tintown. The Mexicans are sr.i-'i
to have become uarrelsome while un
der 'the influence of liquor. . In the
fight that resulted Orozco was slash
ed acrcss the chest. Deputy Sheriff
Billy P.rakelield and Constable Joel
Hodges hurried to Tintown on hearing
of the trouble, and in a- few minutes
had found Andrade in his home and
placed him under arrest. He denied
any knowledge of the affair, but was
positively identitied by Orozco. who
was first taken to the C. & A. hospi
tal, as the kr.ife-wielufer. Andrade
will be given a preliminary hearing
before Judge J. L. Winters Thursday
afternoon.
What is your opinion of a man who
would raise the flag of a foreign na
tion over his home at a time when
thousands of fellow citizens were par
ading through the streets to show
their faith in Old Glory? Perhaps it
sounds inconceivable that anyone
could do such a thing, but now is the
time when inconceivable things art
beginning to become realities, and the
incident of the foreign flag is an ex
ample. At noon Sunday, while hundreds of
people were walking to the Lincoln
school and to Lowell, where the two
divisions of the patriotic parade were
forming, a Gag. either that of Austria
or Germany, was hoisted on a pole on
-Ad dn ii md Jt.vaoii. "I!H looi s
dently feared the federal laws more
than public opinion, for above the for
eign flag floated an American flag.
But the American flag was but a few
I inches in diameter while the other
, emblem was at least three feet long
and almost as wide.
Foreign Flag Lowered
It was not long before the foreeign
flag was noticed. High up on the hill
it seemed to hurl an insulting chal
lenge to the loyal Americans ' who
thronged the streets. A dozen men
rust ed up the hill to haul it down,
but ahead of them were four young
fellows in khaki, members of the
first Arizona Infantry who had come
up from Naco to participate in the
celebration. As they drew nearer
they saw the tiny American flag at
the top of the pole, but atfew inches
above the interloper. The big foreign
flag waved idly in the breeze and
flapped lazily around the pole, but
the smaller emblem of red. white and
blue was flying gaily and confidently
in the wind above, its tiny red and
white stripes and its blue field and
white stars seeming to shout out:
"I may be little, but I'm really bigger
than my unwelcome friend and you
don't have to notice him at all."
Old Glory Still Wave
The soidiers did notice the other
flag, however, and with angry words
they brought it down. High up on
the pole the tiny flag still waved and
sent out its message of loyalty. With
a rousing cheer for it. the soldiers
ran down 'the hill again and once
more mingled with the throng of oth
er true Americans. Several blocks
away an old. white-haired man. bent
with age. stood looking intently at
the tiny flag. Suddenly he turned to
a friend who was passing by and
shouted: "Just look at that littie
feller wave! Ain't he the bravest lit
tle chap you ever did see? Why, he
makes more fuss than six of them otU
er flags, an" he ain't no bigger than a
minute:" . Atjd chuckling with glee,
he doffed his battered hat and bowed
low to the little flag, which, caught in
riuu.vis 'azMjq suiauBi). titppns
around and waved back a cheery
greeting.

the arbitration of the entire dispute.
Always Firm
Mr. Oliu-y's firmness previously had
become familiar to the American pub
lic, though his action in the great
Chicago railroad strike and subse
quent riots, when as attorney general
he upheld the right and duty of the
government to employ troops to crush
the disorder.
In refutation of charges that this
attitude indicated his hostility to lab
or unions. Mr. Olney. in a special
brief filed in a federal court in Penn
sylvania in the case of a railroad
trainmen's strike on the Reading rail
road, only five months after the end
of the Chicago strike, upheld the right
of labor to organize and urged that all
labor troubles should be arbitrated.
Great Lawyer
Mr. Olney was born in Oxford. Mass.
In 1S35. His father was a textile
manufacturer and banker. In the
years following his graduation from
the Harvard law school in 1858. Mr.
Olney won high distinction in his pro
fession and became an authority on
matters of probate, trust and corpor
ation law. His sole appearance in
public office before going to Wash
ington was in lS7ii. when he served
one term in the Massachusetts house
of representatives.
When, in 1964. he permitted the
presentation of his name at the Dem
ocratic national convention as a candl
date for the presidential nomination,
he received 38 votes, including the
solid support of the Massachusetts
delegation. President Wilson urged
him to accept appointment as ambas
sador to Great Britain and later of
fered him the position of governor of
the federal reserve board, but in each
instance Mr. Olney declined.
His public utterances always com
manded thoughtful attention and at
tracted widespread comment. Long
after his retirement from his compar
atively brief career iu public office,
Mr. OIney's counsels were eagerly
sought by members of the Democratic
party.
FANNICE WARD STARS
AT CENTRAL THEATRE
Jesse L. Lasky Actress Fea
tured In "The Years of The
Locust" 4
Fannie Ward, the brilliant Lasky
star, who has achieved such a remark
able success in the photodramatic
field, is to be seen at the Central thea
tre Tuesday in the Jesse L. Lasky
production of "The Years of the Lo
cust." adapted by Harvey F. Thew
from the story by Albert Payson Ter
liune. Miss Ward in her brief photodra
matic career, has risen to the distinc
tion of being one of the screen's most
versatile artists. One moment she is
a little girl as in "Tennessee's Pard
ner." and "Witchcraft." and another
a beautiful and accomplished young
society woman. As the latter she is
seen in "The Years of the Locust."
The story of this thrilling, drama
has to do with a young woman who
was unfortunately wedded to a swind
ling stock broker. How his ruin is
accomplished, how to escape the law
he is supposed to have committed sui
cide, and how his wife is married to
the man whom she really loves, only
to have her first husband appear on
the scene, is brought about in a se
ries of unusual scenes, which swiftly
take the audience from the drawing
rooms in fashionable New York
homes, to the dirt and heat of a South
African diamond mine.
The story contains a remarkable
coincidence, of dramatic and human
interest, in the fact that Miss Ward's
former husband was Joe Lewis, a
South African diamond king, and in
the wedding for1 the photodrama. she
wears the same gown and veil which
she wore in real' life when she was
the most sought after actress in Eng
lish society. Her weddine with the
diamond king was one of the social
sensations of that season.
"The Years of the Locust" gives
Miss Ward an opportunity to display
many of her latest costumes and
gowns and she runs the gamut of fem
inine adornment during the many mi
usual scenes of this photodrama,
from morning negligee to ball gown,
with even the latest mode of London
riding habit thrown in, for good meas
ure, and the charming star's opportun
ity to display some of the wardrobe
for which she is so famous, is one of
the chief attractions of the photodra
ma. Included in the cast are Jack
Dean, the distinguished actor, Walter
Long, who has appeared in a number
of Lacky productions, Charles Ogle
and a number of other members of
the all-star organization. The play
was made for the Lasky Company un
der the direction of George H. Mel
ford, and abounds in beautiful set
tings and excellent photography. It
is a Paramount Picture.

WILSON CHAMPIONS
ARMY DRAFT PLANS
(Continued From Page One)
in the senate until a section authoriz
ing agencies .to obtain recruits for the
army was reached. Chairman Cham
berlain said it was considered neces
sary to get men and instanced the
f8ct that recruiting for the national
guard had not been successful.
"Recruits have flocked to national
guard headuarters ever since the Ger
man ambassador was sent home." de
clared Senator Wadsworth, "but now 1
hear the war department has sent out
orders forbidding the guard to accept
recruits."
Senator Nelson, a veteran of the
Civil war. declared himself in favor
rf a fall frr volunteers
j "I venture to say," he haid, "that if
the President ails for a volunteer army
of 600,000 men and says that it is go
ing to Europe to fight, there would be
no trouble at all. What tie boys
dread above all is to be stationed in
camp with . nothing but drills and
guard duty. What they want is to
march and fight and to meet the
enemy." . ,
The senator added, however, that he
did not believe it necessary to send
an army to Europe.
Senator Stone urged an increase in
the pay of privates to four or five
tims the present amount. He said
that " 'might increase the army bill
$1,000,000,000 a month, but was worth
it because the men who would go to
war would leave behind dependents."
"I don'tMhink this is a business
matter," said Senator Vardaman. "It
is a matter of patriotism."
"We are about to vote $3,000,000.-
000 to the President." replied Senator
Stone. "Very well. I shall vote for it.
but I wouldn't hesitate so far as I
am concerned to compensate the men
who go to the front not purchase
them, not as a bounty, but that it
mieht be the best naid armv in the
world." I
Before the bouse military commit-J
tee Secretary Baker stood firmly for '
the general staff plan. ,
.. "Would you prefer," Representative j
Anthony asked, "authority to raise a
volunteer army within thirty days '
rather than to raise the 500,000 under
a selective draft that might take-' six
months?" . ..'
-'I prefer the- selective draft ' sys
tem," replied the. Secretary..
Mr. Baker approved a suggestion
that instead of authorizing two in
crements of selective draft forces.
500,000 to an increment, .the bill au-1
thorize the President to call as many
such increments from time to time as j
ie deemed necessary to prosecute the '
war. Mr. Baker said the only provis
ion of the administration bill which !
would militate agajnst the rontinu-
ance of the national guard units as ,
such after they had been drafted in
the federal servire, was that the way ;
was to be opened for national guard
officers o promotion to any part of
the new army. This provision was
inserted in justice to the officers of .
the guard and to provide an elastic j
and homogenous military structure. I
Mr. Baker explained also that the
department had been unable to per
mit national guard recruiting to pro
need beyond the peace strength of the
commands because of the shortage of i
i equipment wiiich it could supply im- i
mediately.
The department s reserve
stock was absorbed by the recent bor
der mobilization.
ln lne Benate u,e 1J1S appropna-
tion bill, designed to carry on the ex-
,stinf military establishment made
rapid progress. It has passed the
""
ate committee carrying a total of
$278,000,000 which is additional to the
$3,000,000,000 now asked for the army
to meet the war emergency.
The bill now contains one section,
inserted by the senate committee,
which has a direct bearing on the
war emergency. It does away with
the grade of brigadier general entire
ly, submitting a senior and junior
division of the grade of major general
instead. The grade of brigadier cor
responds to the abolished grade of
! commodore in the navy.
The new section also proposes that
similarly, aepanmemai commanders
will become generals and provision is
made for the grade of lieutenant gen-
eral which has vanished from army
lists wit h the retirement of General
Miles.
With armies in the field of the size
now in contemplation this procedure
becomes urgently necessary in order
that high command ran be properly
assicned and adjusted.

Down in Pennsylvania the wood
from the old covered bridges is much
esteemed as material for the making
of violins. For this wood is time
seasoned, time -cured. And unless
it is made from time-seasoned wood
a violin lacks in tone.

time-cured, lacks in fragrance.
That, friends, is why we time-cure
for long months alHeaf for the OWL
Cigar. That is why we constantly
keep on hand at least $1,000,000 .
worth of mellowing tobacco. And
,.. why our curing experts never allow
any portion of their guarded leaf to
be made into OWL Cigars until it is
exactly "ready" in OWL fragrance.
' These measures guarantee that
your every OWL Cigar will be a
