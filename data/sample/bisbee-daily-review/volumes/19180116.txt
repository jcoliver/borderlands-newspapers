GOOD WiSHES
OF RUSSIANS
English People Issue Mani
festo to Dorminant Party
of Russia, Asking Co-operation
for Great Cause.
l!y Rt-Mw M'lr)
LONDON, Jan. 13. The British
Labor party in a message to the Rus
sian people made puMic tody an
nounced that the British people accept
ed the Russian principle ot self-dwer-mination
ot peoples and no annexation
for the British euipire. particularly in
the middle east. Africa and India.
Themessagewhich was issued by the
labor party in conjunction miih the
parliamentary committee of the trades
union congress, says:
"We have reached a crlMs in the
r. The cegotiatii-ns at Urest Ut
ovsk have been interrupted because
the Germans have refused to admit
the principle -of self-determination ot
peoples and the doctrine of no annex
ations. In thus acting the central
powers are speaking clearly in the
name of a militarist state.
England Must Speak
"In this crisis the British people
must speak because the Russians can
only succeed in their great and peri
lous task it supported by the people
everywhere. The British people must
proclaim to Russia and the ceutral
powers that its aim is Identical with,
Russia's, that we, too. see no solution,
for the evils of militarism except self
determination and do indemnities.
-In applying this Russian principle
to our own case, we are conscious ot
the problem raised, but we do not
shrink therefrom. The British people
accept the principle ot no annexa
tions for the British empire. This ap
plies in our case to the middle east.
Africa and India.
"We wish to remind the Russian
people that Great Britain, taught by
the loss of the American colonies in
the eighteenth century, was the first
modern state to grant complete self
determination to any group ot its in
habitants, for example, the dominions
of Canada. Australia. South Africa
and New Zealand. We accept the
principle also for India and other de
pendencies of the British empire,
though we believe that the record ot
the British government here gives lit
tle occasion for reproach.
Respect Sovereignty
-We Intend to meet this by more
rapid development ot self government
e respect the sovereign Independence
of the Turkish people in their national
home, but we believe that the domi
nation of their government over other
people is a hindrance to their own na
tional development.
"We adjure the peoples of central
Europe to declare themselves or makes
their governments speak for them in
answer to Russia and ourselves. We
call on them to renoun.-e annexation
in Europe with the same good faith in
hich we are renouncing them in Asia.
We call on them to gve the same self
determination to the French. Alsatian,
Italian. Polish and Dunish members
of the! rsiates as Russia has given to
Finland. Courland. Lithuania and Rus
sian Poland."
The manifesto concludes:
-The family in'eret ot dynasties
or the desire of the German. Austrian
and Magyar governing classes to dom
inate other classes and nationalitios.
must no more be suffered to prevent
selfMenuinaiion in central Europe,
and thereby imperil it in Europe as a
whole, than the Interests oi British im
perialism or British capitalism must
be suuVred to do elsewhere.
"lYoples of central Europe: This
citastrophe ot the human race, this
tatal schism in the civilized world can
onlv be ended by the defeat ot mili
tarism on both sides and by the vic
torv on both sides of moral and Intel
lectual fair dealing. If the world is to
bo saved, it must be saved by gtvvl
faith and reciprocity on the part ot the
all. Do not fail us now. IV not let
vour governments drive the British,
people, as they are driving the Rus
sian people, into the terrible choice
between continuing the war and aban
save the world.
-If this choice is forced upon us. we
shall choose, as Russia chose. We
shall continue, but the responsibility
will be yours."

" ' - - . .
l M9 de!egal attending the biennial
convention of the United Mine Work-1
j ers of America which openea nere io-
day.
! "There must be no hall way aneg
iance on the part of the coal miners
in giving the best that is in them for
the preservation of the ideals ana
principles cf a democratic people." ex
claimed President Frank J. Hayes, in
addressing the men.
Let us in this convention firmly
resolve that every atom of energy we
! (n contribute to the winning of the
J war be given gladly, freely, and in the
same loyal spirit as those who go out
jio give their lives, tl is a matter of
! particular pride that approximately
1 20.000 members of our organization
have enlisted in the aailitary forces
i of our nation. Our hearts go with
them across the sea and we know taa
these heroes of ours, who have faced
the perils of the mines year in and
ear onr, risking their lives in the
j prodatcion of coal, will not be found
wanting when they fare the foreign
foe.
No less patriotic were the declara
tions of William Green, secretary
treasurer.
The convention is expected to adopt
strong resolutions backing up the gov
ernment in the present crisis.
Union Suits Reviewed.
Both President Hayes and Secre
tary Treasurer Green devoted consid
erable space in their reports to the
legal fights against the union In one
case, the Coronado Coal company won
$600,000 verdict against the union
in tne ieoerai court at r on ku.hu.

In the other cases the miners were
enjoined in West Virginia from solicit
ing men to join the union, nl the lat
ter contest the supreme court yester
day cited officers to appear March 4
to show cause why they should not be
declared in contempt of court for vio
lating an injunction order
President Hayes said that the union
was confident that it could show that
it was not guilty of contempt.

Secretary Green brought much ap
plause when he declared the justices
of the supreme court had not caught
the spirit of the. times. "They cannot
hear the voices of progress, of demo
cracy and of human richts." he said.
It was explained by Mr. Green that
the $S00.00 verdict would be appeal
ed. An $S"0.000 bond is required to
take such action, he said, and added
that he oposed to paying one penny
f either judgment or costs in the
case. If the court orders judgment
executed and the attachment of the
funds and property of the union is be
gun, so be it." said he. "This will
bring the situation home directly to
the membership and to the attention
of governmental authorities and tbe
public as well"
The reading of a letter or cordial
greeting from President Wilson in
which he said he had no doubt the
miners would ri.e to the occasion in

showing the receipts amounting to $2.272.S3..80. and disbursements, with a
balance on hand at the close of business on December 31st. or $369,666.42.
The report is interesting inasmuch as it shows a considerable net gain in per
capita over the previous year. 1916. or a little more than 540O.OOU. The re
ceipts in 1916 were Jl.S7S.967.i9. Not only does it prove that Cochise county
is handling more business each year, but that the county is growing richer,
there being at present no outstanding indebtedness, and the Sl.0o0.000 road
bond issue to be sold soon will be the only indebtedness against the county.

Wednesday Morning, January 16, 1918.
Tha can from England to the United States to rush
troops to France mast be met with every ounce of effort
this nation can muster. The Briton is not an alarmist,
nor is he a coward. That a supreme test on the western
front is near at hand is generally conceded by the leaders
of the allied nations.
With our railroads ie bad shaps to begin with, new
comes blizzard after blizzard across the northern, middle
and eastern states to paralyze traffic. The transportation
of coal is now the all absorbing problem of the new year.
Families are suffering ior fuel; ships are waiting for it;
factories are closed down and every branch of Industry
in the north and east is at a standstill because of the
scarcity of coal. And tnus again does the weather favor
the Hun by bringing our war work to a standstill.
There's one thing ycu must give it to Germany for;
she is consistent; she always runs true to past form.
Her naval forces, acting, of course, under direct orders
from Berlin, torpedoed another English hospital ship last
week. And Vcn Hindenburg is engaged In razing three
hundred more French towns and cities to the ground.
And the same day the same foreign dispatches carried
the kaiser's speech to the Poles in which he praised his
own "exalted work" as being inspired of God and de
clared it would continue to the end. .'
The Kaiser and his Socialists might well be the title of
any new text book on socialism gotten out at this time.
The leaders of three different and powerful groups of
socialists in Germany are working hand and gUve with
the war lord in his fc-oa policies of war and his hypocriti
cal cant of peace. Consider, if possible, the contrast be
tween a socialist assembly in some back hall of a crowd
ed district of a great city and the council chamber of
the imperial palace at Potsdam. What tie binds these
two places together? What honest principle f socialism
or what one of its worst or best creeds' can dovetail in
with the policies of the most autocratic and cruel and
arrogant ruler upon earth today?
The Briton, always flew to stsrt, is always slow to
quit until he has gained his end. During fifteen centuries
of war he has always been a finish fighter and has seldom
bee a beaten. His indomitable answer to the German re
moval of a million and a half troops from the Russian
to the western front has been the decision to raise a
half million more men to meet them. These, with the
American forces in France and on the way, and the
French reserves, and Cve allied superiority there for a
year past, may be depended upon to hold this front, at
leapt, in the face of a Hunni.sk. offensive ca a great scale
sure to come soon. This war is to a finish. Britain and
France realize it. and America must realize it. Tie Rus
Eian desertion and deozuch must be endured. It si.nply
means a greater effort. England has already set her
lips to meet it. America must redouble her work of
preparation.
DUTY AND OPPORTUNITY OF THE AMERICAN OF
GERMAN BIRTH.
Speaking to a great audience the other night In the
strong German city of Milwaukee, Otto H. Kahn. a Ger
man himself, but an American citizen above all. uttered
the following high and patriotic words that should be
Engraved upon the hearts of every foreigner who has
been adopted and givea freedom and the opportunity for
wealth and happiness in this land:
I do not apologize for, nor am I ashamed of. my Ger
man birth. But I am ashamed bitterly and grievously
ashamed of the Germany which stands convicted before
the high tribunal of the world's public opinion of baring
planned and willed war; of the revolting deeds committed
in Belgium and northern France, of the infamy of the
Lositania murders, of innumerable violations of The
Hague conventions and the law of nations, of abominable
and perfidious plotting ra friendly countries and shameless
abase of their hospitality, of crime heaped upon crime
in hideous defiance of the laws of God and Mien.
I cherish the memories of my youth, but these very
memories make me cry out in pain and wrath against
those who have befouled and discredited the spiritual soil
of the ol Germany in which they were rooted.
Long before the war I had come to look upon Pros,
sianism as amongst the deadliest poison growths that
ever eprang from the soQ of the spirit of man.
When the war broke out In Europe, when Belgium
was invaded, I searched my conscience and -my judg
ment in sorrow and anguish, the powerful voire of blood
arguing against the still, small voice of right.
Now. America, the never defeated, has thrown her
sword into the scale, because to do so was indispensable
for our honor and our safety, the preservation of our in
stitutions and oar very destiny. To cooperate towards
the successful conclusion of the war is the one and su
preme duty of every American, regardless of birth, of
sympathies and of political views.
The American of German, descent who, at this time
of test and trial, does not serve the land of his adoption
with the utmost measure of single minded devotion and
with every ounce of fc's power, perjured himself when
he took bis oath of allegiance and proves himself guilty
of treacherous duplicity. Thank heaven, the number of
those lukewarm in their patriotism, or failing in loyalty.
Is very small, indeed, far too small to affect the record
of Americans cf German birth for good citizenship and
s-rvice to the country in peace and war.
It is not enough for us Americans of German descent
to do our duty by our country and onr fellow citizens,
however fully and unreferved!y. if we do it in resigned
and oppressed silence. I believe we should speak out
We must give voice to our inflexible loyalty and to our
deep conviction of the justice of America's cause.
It is hard, indeed, for us to arraign publicly the coun
try from which we sprang and to tarn against our own
kith and kin, however deep our detestation of their
wrongdoing, under the spiritual and actual sway of the
Prussian caste, and however sincere our allegiance to
America. It will be easily understood by all fairminded
men that right thinking persons will shrink from so
speaking and acting is to lay themselves open to the
accusation of being time servers or popularity seekers,
and to expose their motives to cnisconstrurtton.
These scruples are honorable, and they are felt by
many whose patriotic loyalty and devotion are beyond
all question. But, to cy thinking, they are stamped out
by the iron tread of the times.

"The workers of Arizona are to be congratulated on

fostered the establishment and enlargement of the I'ni

"I do not appeal to your charity charity is not at
issue; I do not appeal tc your patriotism that has been
tried and proven true; but I do most earnestly appeil to
yon to support to the full measure of your ability the
present thrift campaign. It meaas saving, not spending:

Alleged German
Spy Is Sent to
Baltimore Jail
Ry Review Leased Wire)
BALTIMORE. Jan. 15. Lieutenant
Walter Spoermann. charged with be
ing a German spy. arrested on the avi
ation fiield near Norfolk last week,
was brought to Baltimore today. He
was rushed from the railroad station
to the United States marshal's offict
and thence to jail.
Two hours prior to his arrival, his
brother Frederick H. C. Spoermann.
who was arrested here last night, was
sent to jail also.
Another man. Marina Aisch. of this
city, was arrested today, and there
was considerable activity at the feder
al offices with rumors that other sus
pects were being bagged.
Aisch. it developed, held some pap
ers belonging to Lieutenant Spoer
mann. He himself volunteered the in
formation to the Baltimore police.
Tne papera were seize!, bat little
apparently of incriminating nature
was discovered from them. Aisch ex
plained that he had been acquainted
with Spoermann for some time, and
that Spoermann temporarily left a suit
case containing the papers for him.
There is much secrecy among the
government officials as to the number
of persons arrested in connection with
the case, though reports to Washing
ton indicate seven or eight are In cus
tody. The woman whose friendship with
Spoermann led to his apprehension at
Norfolk is not nnder arrest. It was
through Spoermann's fascination for
her that he was traced from Baltimere
to Washington and finally located in
Newport News.
She was a violinist for a Washing
ton hotel and Spoermrpt nas In fre
quent communication with her
Interception of mail to the woman
resulted in the naval intelligence oper
atives finding him in the employ of a
construction contractor at Langley
aviation field near Norfolk. " This was
about two weeks ago.
An enemy alien permit was issued
to Spoermann several months ago and
the record showed statements from
him that he had come to America
with his brother, Frederick, in 1910.
These statements, so far as could be
ascertained, were never rerified by
federal agents. Papers seized in his
rooms here in Baltimore last week,
along with those indicating dealings
with Bernstorff and Boy-Ed. indicate
that he had "report ed tor service" in
Germany after the war began in Aug
ust, 1914.
This would apparently dispute Spoer
mann's statements on his alien record
in 1910, except that he could have re
turned to Germany surreptitiously, re
ported for service there and later re
entered the United States without de
tection. Door

Things baked with economical
Cottolene are digestible and whole
some. For instance, pie crust made
with Cottolene really is wholesome.
Both top crust and bottom crust
are flaky and flavory.
Cottolene makes delicious cakes, too.
Rercember always: You use tme-tkird
Ust of Cottolene than of expensive
, butter or other shortenings. This is be
cause Cottolene sets the highest possible
standard for purity and rkkucis.
RECIPE
Saucer Pies
1 caps flour teaspoon salt
X teaspoon baking powder
24 cup Cottolene Ice water
Sift together floor, baking powder and
salt. Chop in chilled Cottolene with
knife (reserving 1 tablespoons). Add
just enough ice water to form soft dough.
Roll in thin sheet and spread with re
maining Cottolene. Roll like jelly rq!l
and chill. Then stand roll on end, press
down with hand and roll again. Cut to
fit small saucers and U whh desired
filling. Finish with strips of pastry ai
