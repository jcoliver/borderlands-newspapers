The announcement is the result
of conferences held by copper

HA&Hi.uiu., July 10. The suc

re-establishing order In Siberia and in
overcoming armed opposition from
former German and Austrian prison

preparation of plans by the entente
and the United States for the organ

force to campaign in Siberia.
It was stated authoritatively today
that none of the plans considered liad

(f.y Review Tensed Wire)
WASHINGTON. July 10. A gradu

Administrator Hoover In a letter to
Senator Simmons, chairman of the sen

in reply to a request for Mr. Hoover's
views on the revenue bill.
While condemning profiteering In
war times as "hateful." Mr. Hoover
declared that there is a distinction be
tween moral and economic profiteer
ing. "On the mora! side," .he wrote, "the
nation is endeavoring to draw a dis
tinction between a profit commensur
ate with the effort, or capital employed
and stimualtive to enterprise and pro
duction, and the profit that Is abnorm-
ally large due to war conditions."
I Even under this stimulation plan.
Mr. Hoover points out. excessive
profits may be made by the low-cost
producers in a given line of industry
and points to sugar as an example.
Max'mum prices which would insure a
profit to high-cost producers were
agreed upon but at this level of prices,
he said a minority of the beet sugar
factories "will be earnrng profits oi
from

is a serious threat to the right flank of
the Lulpartans in the vicinity of Mon
aster. This Is evidently appreciated
by the enemy and will have the effect
of tuingiiig to the side of the cilies
many from the hill tribes, which are
auirtig the finest fighters In the world
ff. ery fresh success of the allies
will hearten the south Slav races, who
are already in revolt against their
Austrian rulers.
A further short advance will bring
the allies to lierat. the chief town of
southern Albania, and it is significant
that Austrian official statements ad

'Confidence in government circles

victory cannot be dragged away from
us. We have vanquished in the east
and we shall conquer in the west.

BRITISH AIRMEN
inuAk
WESTERN FRONT
WITH Tilt: BKiTISii AIl-MV IN
FRANCE. July 10, (By tne Associated
Freso). Superiority m the air rests
with the lirilisii living men tnuay.
Theie have been times when a siigut
addition to either one side might up
the balance but now bntisn airmen
are supreme.
The liruish have houuded hostile
pilots umil tag greater part ol their
uatties have occurred east of tne uer-
man lines and in numerous engage
ments great numbers of hostile mat-Dines
have been destroyed. One lirii-
ibh aviator alone has sent 2a crashing
to the earth in the last tew montns.
1 be work of bombing squadrons has
been growing and the liriiish are
reaching furtner and further into tier
man back areas. Day and night squa
drons of British planes Dave kept up
an almost endless boinDardment oi im
portant positions uud their accuracy in
bomb dropping is testified to in scores
of photographs of destructive hits.
Airdromes and other vital oDjeclives
have been elfectually bombed. The
loss of life among German troops in
concentration camps has been heavy.
Captured documents bear testimony to
mis and prisoners admit it.
'1 he British sometimes come within
fifty teet of the ground to loose bointis.
The Germans seldom venture below
10, mm feet because of anti-aircralt
defenses. A pilot who attacked two
German trains near lleruues obtained
a direct bit on the first train and then
blew up the track in tront. Diving
on another train, he knocked two
trucks off the track with explosives.
Having stalled these trains he rakea
them with his machine gun. Incident
ally, he opened fire witn his machine
gun on seven other trains shortly ait
erward with good results.
There have been few Infantry bat
tles recently on the British front in
which airmen could play a striking
part, but In the combined Australian
American attack south of the Soiume
cn July 4. the British pilots did out-j
standing and invaluable work. Germaa
infantry columns, concentration
points, ammunition trains and bat
teries were heavily bombed through
out ehe engagements and numerous
machine gun and battery crews were
knocked out by these low-flying ter
iors. Even individual infantrymen
were run down and shot by pilots who
swooped and swirled over the field
like dragon flies.
An example of the methods employ
ed was seen southeast of Lamolte-Kn-Santerre.
Here a British pilot blew
up a German lorry and blocked a
highway crowded by inarching troops.
He theu began a whirlwind of machine
gunfire against the unprotected rifle
men, who probably suffered more casu
alties in the next five minutes than
tbey did in all the rest of the battle.
1 he German airmen were doing a lot
of low flying that day. as is their cus
tom during battle and they were thor
oughly outfought, many of their planes
being destroyed.
Out of scores of aerial combats re
cently, there have been some that pro-d-jf-ed
unusual features. On July 4 a
battle royal was fought between the
British and twenty hostile pianos.
Despite the fact that the British were
greatly outnumbered, they came out
victorious. Three of the enemy mat-hires
had been destroyed and another
driven down out of control when the
fishtina; ended, while all the British
returned safely.
On July 1, near Braye a British cap
tain, who was leading an offensive
patrol, dived cn a German biplane and
pumped a stream of bullets Into it
while sitting directly on its tail. The
enemy went down almost immediately
in 1 lames. The captain then fired at
another German, who went clown ver
tically, but what happened to the Hun
was not determined. Then the cap
tain, w ith three other planes, attacked
a grent German fleet of about forty
machines.
The captain so riddled one enemy
scout plf.ne that one of its wings fell
off and crashed like a stone. He next
wheeled on another scout and shot it
down out o" control with bursts ffoin
above.

BODY OF 1TCIIEL
VIEWED BY MANY
NKW YOKK, July 10 Silent, mad
dened citizens in seemingly endless
lines marched through the rotunda of
the city hall tonight past the fla.j;
draped cotfin in which reposed the
body of Maj. John Puroy Mitchel.
The coffin had been sealed before
it was brought to the historic building"
to lie in state where the bodies of
Abraham Lincoln and U. S. Grant once
lested. Those who passed before it
lelt no shame in the tearB shed for
the young officer who left the mayor's
chair to serve his country and fell to
his .death in a Louisiana aviation field j
last Saturday. I
There was no shade of black vith-
iit the city h.ill. On the wall was hun?
au American tlac. flanked by the col
ors of the allies. A soft epotii'at
played on the flags and another on
the coffin. Beside which was a stand
of United States flaps.
A service flaee of white with a nar
row black border, bearing a siiiKle
golden star, was draped beside the
casket, while another gold service
Ftar on a shield was hung between
the center pillars of the building.
At tiie stroke of a a troop of mount
ed policemen galloped into city hal !
park r-iv'nK warning to the thousands j
gathered there that the body of Ma-
jor Mitchel had arrived from the home j
of his widowed mother to lie in state j
in the building wi'.ere he ruled the
affairs of the city for four years. I
At 5:50 the iron gates of the city i
hall were thrown oprn and word was
carried to the waiting throng that the '
tod - of Major Mitche ll was ly'ng in ;
state. From then until lar into .nc
night, men, women and children filed
past the coffin at the rate of 20 a
minute paying a final tribute c re
spect. I
The first in line was a little boy in
a sailor's suit. He was followed by j
!n aged women, dressed in black and !
behind her was a bareheaded woman I
with a baby in her arris. Then came
a flood of New York s citizens of ev
ery race and every walk in life.

Mining and Financial News
BY REVIEW
KEW YORK. July 10. Midsummer
auimess prevailed during me greater
part of today b stock market session,
but the final hour wag enlivened by
sn active selling movement, -with num
erous net losses.
United States Steel and related In
dustrials as well as shippings and
various specialties were carried down
In the sharp decline.
Standard rails were at their best In
the later dealings, but forfeited their
moderate gains with many of the low
priced transportations.
The cost of new corporate financ
ing was emphasized by reports that
the forthcoming issue of Hethlehera
Steel notes upuld be offered at a 7Vi
per cent basis exclusive of the syndi
cate's commission. These and other
adverse conditions were discounted by
the United 'ates steel June state
ment, showing an increase of almost
600,000 tons in unfilled . orders, the
first gain since last January.
Sales amounted to 310,000 shares.
Bonds were steady on light trad
ing, Liberty Issues makinr partial re
coveries from their early setback.
Sales, par value, aggregated $4,750,000.
Old United States bonds were un
changed. GRAIN
CHICAGO, July 10 Subnormal tem
peratures throughout the corn belt
more than offset in the corn market
today the bearish Influence of the gov
ernment report. Largely as a result
the finish, although unsettled, was
to cent net higher, with August
$1.55 to $1.55. and September,
$1.56.
Oats lost M to cent. Provisions
closed unchanged to 10 cents down.
Oats gave way In sympathy with a
break In prices at Winnipeg, where
longs were said to be unloading. The
government crop report had but little
effect on oats.
Realizing by stockyard Interests
weakened provisions. Advances in
the value of bogs caused only a tran
sient bulge.

PLATINUM
To the average layman and laywoman
the word platinum brings no association to
the mind other than that of jewelry. That
to a considerable extent the outcome of the
war depends upon our supply of the metal
occurs to very few. Yet such is the case,
and, recognizing this, congress has just en
acted a measure limiting the sale, posession,
and use of platinum under license from the
director of the bureau of mines. Charles
H. Herty, editor of the Journal of Industrial
and Engineering Chemistry, explained the
other day why platinum is of such vast im
portance, why it is being desperately sought
tor all over the world.
"What the country needs," he said, "is
to be awakened to the fact that without
platinum we can wage no war and that to
use platinum at this time for the purpose
of human adornment is well-nigh criminal.
"A few days ago the appropriation com
mittee voted $5,000,000,000 to be used for
artillery for Pershing's army. That artillery
isn't worth a red cent if it is not furnished
with propelling force and high explosive
force inside its shells to, make the kaiser
aware of our presence. To get that force
platinum is absolutely necessary, not as
platinum, but as a catalyst in the manufac
ture of sulphuric and nitric acid. It is also
essential in airplane manufacture. A
catalyst is a chemical body needed in the
formation of certain chemical compounds.
Platinum is the catalyst in the manufacture
of sulphuric and nitric acid. A quantity of
the metal can be used indefinitely for the
same process. It loses nothing in the for
mation of the gases and always maintains
the same bulk and form.
"It is true that there is another way of
making sulphuric, acid, the lead chamber
process, which has been largely used in the
manufacture of acids for fertilizer. But
there are several things that work greatly
against this plan. First, our supply of lead
is not sufficient to warrant using it for
making munitions on any large scale; sec-
ond, it takes almost a year to put up a lead
chamber sulphuric acid plant, whereas a
platinum contact process plant can be put
up in about six weeks. It took the du
Pont people exactly that length of time to
build such a plant recently. And, third,
the product furnished by the platinum pro
cess is the strongest and best.
. "The importance of nitric acid is equally
great. In the past we used to manufacture
that product solely by treating Chile salt
peter with sulphuric acid. Today there are
good reasons why this method is not the
most efficient. First of all, we must again
resort to our supply of sulphuric acid, and,
secondly, we have not the ships to spare to
brng the saltpeter from Chile, nor do we
know how long we can count upon Chile
to supply us. Today the government is be
ginning the manufacture of nitric acid by
the platinum gauze process. Several large
plants are being erected in Ohio and in Ala
bama, for the purpose cf fixation of atmos
pheric nitrogen. To make nitric acid you
mix ammonia pas with air and allow the
mixture to pass over a fine platinum gauze.
The chemists of the bureau of mines have
tried various substiUites for platinum, but
the results are not comparable to the acid
rrd by the platinum rau process. .
"We have at the present time enough
platinum to supply, let us say, 2,000,000
men. We can keep on making munitions
for that number. As I stated before, the
metal is not consumed when used as a
catalyzer. 'Why worry, then?' you may
ask. For this reason: We must not limit
either the number of men fighting or the
amount of munitions for them. At the
present time we can supply a certain
amount, but not a bit over that amount.
"The sources of supply for platinum are
Russia and Colombia. In the past the
United States used to get 90 per cent of its
supply from Russia which, by the way,
controls 95 per cent of the world's supply
of that metal and less than 1 0 per cent
from Colombia. Our domestic supply is
well-nigh negligible, meeting less than 1 per
cent of our needs, and experts hold out no
hope of any increase in the domestic production."
RUSSIA
Nothing but bad news comes out of Rus
sia. Herman Bernstein, special correspond-'
ent for the New York Herald, recently
returned from a six months' stay in Russia,
confirms all of the worst that has been
looked for from this unhappy and betrayed
land. ' He declares that Trotzky is riding
around in the former czar's automobile.
(How the I. W. W. will enjoy this, for 'tis
one of their fondest and oft-quoted dreams
come true). That the bolsheviki drinking
wines in palaces and the former nobility
working at menial tasks. (More I. W. W.
stuff). Bernstein declared further that
chaos, under the sway of the bolsheviki,
has grown steadily until Russia has prac
tically been transformed into a German
colony, the people betrayed, humiliated,
disheartened, the country dismembered and
falling to pieces.
Mr. Bernstein declared that "'the bolshe
viki have removed their mask of socialism
and style themselves communists now.
But they are enslaving Russia more thor
oughly than the kaiser could have done
without their aid, for they are posing as
Russians and as liberators of the prolet
arat." He quoted a letter from Vladimir
Bourtseff, "one of Russia's foremost cham
pions of liberty," in which appeared this
paragraph :
"For Russia is actually helping now the
Germans against the allies, and if nothing is
done- to offset this perhaps tomorrow Rus
sian armies under the command of Lenine
and Trotzky, Hindenburg and Hertling,
may be forced to advance against the
allies." , '
It is declared that the Fourth of July
parade on Fifth avenue in New York
eclipsed all of the many splendid and stir
ring pageants that have swept up and down
that famous thoroughfare since the war be
gan. For ten hours the tramp of marching
feet and the glitter of flags and emblems
swept ceaselessly by in the bright July sun
shine. Every nationality under the sun was
represented there. Black and white and
yellow and brown. American, French,
British and Polish soldiers marched under
the stars and stripes. Loyal German
Americans were there in strength and
cheered their new country's flag of freedom
as they marched along. All day long New
York watched them, "passin by." It was
not a mere parade, a ceremony, a pageant,
it was a national heartbeat.
After all, the people who have to stay
at home during vacation time are not so
much to be pitied as one might think, that
is, if they live in Bisbee. It is true that
these gay and glad vacationists may bask
upon the beaches and see the waves break
on the shore, and they are in the land of
gardens and flowers and orange groves and
picture studios and cement roads and wine
and honey, as it were. Yet, still, it is mighty
hot on the coast. While here in Bisbee
these July days are cool and pleasant. A
little wind and a little rain every other day
to drive the heat away. And so the stay-at-homes
may be dull and may grapple with
care and see only the mirage of water, yet
they do not swelter; neither do they melt
and run away.
Cr.to Sells, commissioner of Indian af
fairs, has compiled some statistics in regard
to the part played by the original Amer
icans (Indians) in the war, that are amaz
ing in their sum total of achievement. The
Indians have bought $13,000,000 in Lib
erty bonds, which is $40 per capita for
every Indian in this courtry. There are
5000 Indians in the army, and their record
for soldierly qualities and their adap'.itude
to training are class ore. Again, the Indian
women are helping in wonderful fashion in
Red Cross work. Take him all in all. the
Indian is a patriot and a .taff on the hi!l for
his Great White Father in Washington.

GEOPiGE WILSON TELLS
FRIENDS ADVENTURES
Word has been received from George
Wilson, better known as "Lefty," stat
ing that he is now tn France. Wilson
is well known in this city, Tombstone
and Douglas.
The following is the letter written
to his father and mother here:
"Somewhere in France.
"As I am off of duty today I thought
I would write you a few lines. I am
setting along fairly good. The tobac
co here is very high so send me a
good supply cf cigarette smoking to
bacco and a pound of chewing tobac
co. I had a fine trip across the ocean
and did not get sea sick once but
about three-fourths of the men did
The band 'was with us add we had a
good supply of books on hand to read,
so the trip was not so very monot
onous, although evpry morning we did
exp?ct to see land but later our hopes
would drop. Mail only goes out every
three weeks so you will not receive
letters from me very regularly but 1
will write whenever possible. If any
of my friends want to write to me my
address is: 'Headquarters company.
113th F. A., American Expeditionary
Force.'
"Do not abbreviate the last three
words, they must be written out in
full. We are having a great deal of
trouble with foreign money as we can
not toi'nt it. I sent a boy In the
store with a ?5 bill, American money,
and he brought me a whole bag full
of change. I though I was getting
about $25 back, but it wasn't. I must
bring this to a close but will write In
two or three weeks.
"Vour son,
"GEORGE WILSON."
CUNNINGHAM RECEIVES
FIRST YEAR'S RENTAL
M. J. Cunningham, cashier of the
Bank of Bisbee, received a check yes
terday yes, yes, of course, he receives
many, but this check was different,
and .Mr. Cunningham viewed ;t with
some pride. It was from tu& United
States government and for thj small
sum of one dollar. But then it was
rental, principal and interest for one
pair of binnoculars that Mr. Cunning
ham had sent to the navy department
as per request of all good citizens
of the republic.
With the development of the war
on the U-boat binnoculars, field
glasses and every species of telescope
are in demand by the navy depart
ment. The lenses for these glasses
were manufactured almost exclusively
in Germany before the war, hence they
are very scarce. The United States
government has appealed to the coun
try at large for field glasses, and it is
said that it has met a most liberal re
sponse. As Mr. Cunningham said
yesterday, "If people only knew of the
urgent demand for any kind of a glass,
they would not hesitate to ransack
trunk and drawer for their old gk'Ees
and tend them in."
TO SUBSCRIBERS
The bills for the month of July sub
scriptions are now being made out in
the Keview office and the subscribers
are very respectfully requested to give
this their attention at their earliest
possible convenience. It. wa?, at oue
time, tho practice of tho Review to
collect ull sulHit-riplion accounts by
the carriers. This method was ineffic
ient and not suited to the best inter
ests of the customer or paper. Last
summer thr. system. was changed so
that all accounts were run from the
first of one month to the first of the
next and the bills for any one month
presented after tho first payday in
tliKt month. If all tho subscriber
will pay at the office the service will
lie bettered because we then can hear
first hand the difficulties of the indi
vidual subscribers and work out a w;iy
to make the service 100 per rent ef
ficient. Therefore, in conclusion, we
wish to ak nil of our suhscriliers to
pay their subscription bills at the of-
1 '..' and not tone us to send out col
lectors monthly. The benefit will be j
mutual. We tliank you.

Friends in Tucson have been advised

Kenny, who was a well known Pima

for service in the ambulance corps.
Kenny was with section of the am

While commission merchants of
Phoenix are shipping in an inferior
grade of potatoes to be disposed of to
consumers in Phoenix and the Salt
River valley, potatoes of a vastly su
perior quality are being shipped out
of Salt River valley, the cars passing
each other in transit. Just why thj
producer of potatoes in Salt River val
ley has to seek a market for his pro
duct in Denver and other places while
the people of Salt River valley have to
put up with potatoes of a poor quality
brought in from Imperial valley is a
question that the growers in this
vicinity would like to have answered.
With the demand for potatoes in Phoe
nix at tbi3 time being so great, local
growers are forced to ship their su
perior quaHy outside of the state to
find a market when there are not
enough potatoes grown in Salt River
valley to supply the demands of Phoenix.

of co-operation by which inter-mountain
states may not be subjected to the
same general scheme of rate increases
that apply to all sections of the coun

exist in the inter-mountain states may
be met with special regulation.

measurement of hearing. In a Marca
issue of the Journal of the American
Medical . association Dr. Brownfield
published an interesting article which
described his invention and its ability
to detect malingering or pretended
loss of hearing.
I Not long after this article appeared
in print me surgeon general's oftice

the instrument filled a long felt need
for the detection of pretended loss of

1 The importance of a machine for
i detetbing pretended loss of hearing
in war times Is shown in the foiiowm.;
I statements quoted from Dr. Brown
I field's article in the medical journal,
j "Aurists have long felt the need of a
I more accurate test tor the faculty of
'hearing. The present war with its
j prodigal use of high explosives has
made the need more keenly felt than
ever, and especially as the damage
done to the auditory apparatus is ouen
only -temporary it becomes imperative
to have an accurate test to detect
those who falsely claim permanent in
jury for the purpose of avoiding fur
ther military duty. The necessity for
such a test will be even more press,
ing at the close of the war, when loss
ol hearing may be either pretended or
exaggerated in order that a pensioa
may be secured." '

WOMEN RAPIDLY ARE
REPLACING MEN IN
STORES OF CITY
"So many men have joined the. army
and those between the ages of 31 and
45 years who remain l.ere, must be
employed in some kind of productive
work, according to the new orders is
sued, makes male help scarce," said
M. J. Brophy yesterday. "It makes
it necessary for stores to engage wo
men clerks."
A large number cf me.i employed in
the local stores already have gone to
join some department In the govern
ment service or have obtained produc
tive employment. On inquiring wheth
er the call for women clerks has met
with willing response, Mr. Brophy
said that women- are being employed
as fast as the men leave and the vac
ancles which are filled by the women
are ably managed. He a '.so stated that
in nearly every department of the
store women were taking orders from
customers and preparing the goods for
delivery, just as the male clerks had
done hitherto. -
There are about wo hundred em
ployes in the Phelps Dodge store and
nearly half of this number are women.
In all the other stores of the dist
rict women take a large lead over the
number of men employed. Women are
becoming competent clerks and in the
office branches also, they work re
markably well.
Good results are accomplished In
every line and plans for women in
industry are being worked out with
great care.

Attorney General and County j
Attorney Ross to Make Test '
of New Law Regarding!
Transporing of Whiskey
With five prospective claimants or
automobiles seized under the amend
ment to the prohibition law. preparing
to lay clainj to the cars and claiming
that the cars were used without their
knowledge and consent. County At
torney Ross is on the side of the state,
preparing to uphold the constitutional
ity of the new law and tc enforce it
energetically.
The county atorneys are being
backed un by Attorney General Wiley
Jones, who has taken up the matter
of the enforcement i the law and the
preparation of complaints under the
law, with the several county attorneys,
by letter.
The attorney general states that un
on any appeal of a defendant he will
take upon himself the responsibility
of defending the constitutionality of
tne law before the supreme court.
Attorney General's Letter
Attorney uenerai Jones' letter to
county attorneys. Is as follows
"I enclose a copy of the law passed
at the recent session of the legisla
ture which authorizes and directs the
confiscation of an automobile or other
vehicle which may be engaged at any
tftae in the unlawful transportation of
Intoxicating liquor within the state of
Arizona.
"It is your duty and mine to rigldlv
enforce this law regardless of opposi
tion o. any claimant to an auto or
Sther vehicle so engaged. As strenu
ous efforts will be made bv claim
nts of automobiles caught in an un
lawful transportation to vigorously
contest the validity of the law. I sug
gest that In drawing the information
for prosecutions under this law that
the automobile or other vehicle be de
scribed with such accuracy that the
court may pronounce judgment of con
fiscation by proper description of the
machine In such judgment. If you as
attorney general obtain a judgment of
confiscation of any such vehicle caught
in such unlawful transportation, I will
certainlv take upon myself the re
sponsibility of the law before the su
preme court upon any appeal taken by
tne oeiennant.
"This law is now in full force and
effect under Its emergency clause and
its prompt, vigorous and successful
enforcement will be most effectual in
making bootlegging In Arizona a thing
or the past. While the sheriffs
throughout the state report that in
mnking captures of liquor they have
ascertained that the price of such
liquor has gone up over one thousand
per cent, through our enforcement of
the prohibition law in Arizona, we are
justified in hoping that the effectual
enforcement of this new law, will ad
vance the price higher than' that of
radium within the state at an early
date, and drive the curse of bootleg
ging from Arizona.
Yours verv truly,
WILEY E. JONES.
"Attorney General."

GRANDMOTHER WAS THE DRUG
GIST In the early days of our country
grandmother was the drugzist. anil h'-r
drugs consisted mostly of roots and
herbs gathered from the fields and for
ests. There was peppermint for indi
gestion, mullen for coughs, skulli-ap
for nervousness, thoroughwort for
colds, wormwood for bruises and
sprains and so on. They wer suc
cessful remedies, too. It was frVm a
i combination of such roots an.l herbs
that Mrs. Lydia E. Pinkhum of Lynn.
Mass.. more than forty years aico.
originated her now famous Vegetal !e
