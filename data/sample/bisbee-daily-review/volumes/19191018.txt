ATTEMPTS BY SECRETARY VII
TO AVERT GOAL
Cabinet Labor Head Invites Scale Committee of Operators
and Miners to Second Conference in An Effort
to Settle Controversy; Invitation Accepted
But Success Doubted.
' WASHINGTON1, Oct. 17. Failing
after an all-day conference to avert
a strike of nearly 500,000 bituminous
coal miners, called for the very eve
of winter, Secretary of Labor "Wil
son tonight invited miners and op
erators to send their full scale com
mittees to Washington next Tuesday
when another effort to bring peace
In the Industry will be made.
Both sides accepted the invitation.
This did not offer any great hope,
however, for representatives of the
operators stood firm in their deter
mination not to negotiate any de
mand for a six-hour day and not to
deal with the unions unless the
strike, set for November 1, was
called off.
John L. Lewis, acting president
of the United Mine Workers of
America, showed that he was labor
ing under a terrible strain when he
left the meeting. Speaking to a
group of reporters, he said he had
told Secretary Wilson that the 32
members . of his wage scale com
mittee would be here Tuesday to
meet an equal number from the
other side, but that it would be use
less to reconvene the joint Interstate
wage conference "unless the opera
tors changed their stone-wall atti-l
tude" and indicated a willingness to
frame another agreement.
Thomas T. Brewster, chairman of
the ..operators of the central compe-j
titive coal fields, which embraces
the state of Illinois, Indiana, Ohio
and western Pennsylvania, after sit
ting through the day at a table with
Secretary Wilson .and Mr. Lewis,
hurried away from the secretary's
office and refused to talk. An hour
or two later he sent' word to Mr.
Wilson that his scale committee
would be on hand for the joint con-,
ference. At the outset Secretary1
Wilson, sitting between Lewis and
Brewster, urged them to resume ne-j
gotiations and reconvene the joint,
wage conference, pointing out that
he was making this effort by direc
tion of the president's cabinet. Lewis
indicated the grounds on which the
miners would negotiate, and after
a recess, Brewster returned with a
written statement outlining the con
ditions under which the operators'
would do the same. These were:
Indication of a willingness on the
part of the miners to carry out the
existing contract, which former Fuel
Administrator Barfield declared was
"still In effect."

continuation of work pending nego
tiations. '?

ABDICATION OF KING H. C. L. PREDICTED WHEN
ATTORNEY GENERAL PALMER LINES UP WOMEN OF
U. S. AGAINST PROFITEERS AND FOOD HOARDERS
WASHINGTON, Oct. 17. At
torney General Palmer-and his of
ficial associates in the fight on
the high cost of living determined
today to enlist the aid of the
women of America.
By appealingto the . comptroll
ers of household finances
throughout the country it is
hoped to inaugurate an epoch of
real economy which will offset
the "buy , now" propaganda . of ;
tradespeople. Furthermore, an
attempt' will be made to discour
age the frequent changes in
styles dictated by makers of
women's apparel and thereby ef
fect a saving in clothing. An
other important decision taken at
today's meeting was to release
more surplus supplies held by
the government, if it can be done
without embarrassment to the de
partments involved. Secretaries
Faker and Daniels and Chairman
John Barton Payne, of the ship
pine board, were invited to the
conference for the first time for
tht nurpose. Mr. Baker being
unable tc attend, the attorney
general and Mr. Daniels will con
fer wilh him next week. Mr.
Daniels reported that he had
sugar enough to run the navy
six months, but ' before he re
leased any of it wanted to be as
sured of ample replacements.
L
STRIKE
standard of eight hours a day, six
days a week.
On the heels of this, Brewster's
statement, addressed to Secretary
Wilson, sharply attacked collective
bargaining.
"As pertinent to the questions in
volved," he wrote, "the operators
deem it advisable that the coal op
erators of the central competitive
field have adhered to the princi
ples and practices of collective bar
gaining for 33 years with the largest
body of organized labor in the
United States and it is our opinion
that our scale negotiations have
broken down and that our contract
has been abrogated by the miners'
union in their call for a strike No
vember 1, because the present sys
tem of collective bargaining does
not fix equal responsibility under
the law upon the employer and the
labor union.
"Our experience teaches us that
no set of employers should agree to
a system of collective bargaining
which does not make both parties to
the contract equally liable and re
sponsible for the observance ' of the
terms of such contract."

that he and all other members of the

CHICAGO, Oct. 17. Eamonn de
Valera, addressing a reception com
mittee today during a brief stop en
route westward, declared an Irish
consulate would be established in
New York to look after commercial
interests of Ireland.
Valera left here for Milwaukee.
Indicative of the broad scope
which Mr. Palmer's efforts are
taking was the request of Chair
man Payne to release any surplus
building materials which he has
on hand, especially lumber need
ed for home building. The ship
ping board, it was learned, prob
ably will need, however, all of
the supplies which it has pur
chased. Co-operation of the housewives
has been the subject of extended
conference between H. E. Figg, of
the department of Justice, and
Mrs. Edward P. Costigan, who
offered the government the full
resources of the Consumers'
league and the League of Women

Four Specialists in Conference
With Dr. Grayson Agree
That Operation May Not Be
Necessary; Swelling Gone
WASHINGTON, Oct: 17. Definite
Improvement in President Wilson's
condition was noted in a bulletin is
sued tonight from the White House by
Rear Admiral Grayson and the four
physicians called in consultation. The
prostatic condition was said , to be
greatly Improved and no operation will
be necessary.
The swelling of th prostate gland, a
recurrence of which today served to
retard the president's recovery, was
said to have been relieved so much
that a simplified form of treatment
could now be Instituted. The general
condition of the president, it was said,
remains good.
Tonight's bulletin was signed by
Dr. Grayson and by Dr. John Young,
the Johns Hopkins hospital specialist;
Dr. H. A. Fowler, a Washington spe
cialist; Dr. Sterling Ruffin, a Wash-
Ington " physician," andR"eaYAdmiral
Stitt, head of the naval hospital here.
It said:
"The president's prostatic gland
swelling referred to in previous bulle
tins is definitely improved and is caus
ing little discomfort, so that the treat
ment has been simplified. The kid
neys are functioning normally and the
heart action is excellent. The temper
ature, pulse and blood pressure re
main normal."
Although no operation was regarded
necessary at this time by the physi
cians called in for consultation, Dr.
Grayson requested Dr. Young and oth
er physicians to meet him tomorrow
to continue the study of thee case. Dr.
Young returned to the White House
early tonight, observed the patient
again and had a long conversation
with Dr. Grayson. An air of distinct
relief was displayed at the White
House after the consultation and it
was unofficially stated that as a result
of the treatment given today it now is
believed that it will be possible to
keep the trouble arising from the local
ailment In such obeyance as not to in
terfere with Mr. Wilson's recovery.

for the grand jury and in two
other cases jail sentences and
fines have been imposed. The

That there is no cause for a re

ters of the United Mine Workers
of America here today.
"Since the call for a strike of

Italian Dirigible
Will Attempt Rome
S. America Flight
ROME, Thursday, Oct. 1C (By the
Associated Press.) Celestine Usu
elli, one of the pioneers of aviation
in Italy, claims to have invented a
new dirigible 380 yards long and 80
yards wide and provided with six mo
tors of 500 horse power each, with
which he intends to fly from Rome to
South America, 'stopping at Dakar,
1 West Africa.
The dirigible, v Signor Usuelli
claims, is capable of transporting a
weight of 20 tons and can attain a
speed of 45 miles an hour with ' one
motor, 52 miles with two motors and
72 miles an hour with all six work
ing. Using one motor alone, it is
said, the dirigible can navigate for
six days and cover more than 5000
miles. Signor Usuelli asserts the
dirigible is so constructed that it can
float on water. He expects it will
take six days to fly from Rome to
South Africa.
LABOR BEGINS
Injunction Asked Restraining
Pittsburgh Mayor From
Preventing Meetings on
Streets of City
PITTSBURGH, Oct .17. Organized
labor today began its legal battle in
the courts for the right of free speech
and assemblage which the steel
strikers claim has been denied them
by public officials of Pittsburgh and
Allegheny county. A bill in equity,
asking for an injunction restraining
Mayor E. V. Babcock, the director of
the department of public safety, the
superintendent of the police and com
missioner of police from preventing
labor meetings was filed in the coun
ty court and the hearing will be held
here next Tuesday. It was also
given out that a large number of
damage suits would be filed against
corporations and public officials for
alleged false arrests of strikers, as
saults and unlawful search of houses.
The bill of complaint was sworn
to by J. L. Beaghen, a general organ
izer for the American Federation of
Labor. It recites that the plaintiff
and the American Federation of La
bor had proved their "unquestioned
loyalty" to the United States during
the war. The bill states that labor
union meetings have been held from
time to time, but that since October
6, the defendants have "wilfully,
wickedly and in disregard of their
oaths" refused to. permit the plaintiff
or any organization affiliated with
the American Federation of Labor to
hold meetings.

VOTED DOWN
Action Defeated Without the
Formality of Roll Call Be
ing Taken; Ballot on Last
Two Reservations Soon
WASHINGTON, Oct. 17. After a
brief debate and without the formality
of a record vote, the senate today
threw out two more of the amend
ments written into the peace treaty by
the foreign relations committee.
The two amendments had been in
troduced by Senator Fall, Republican,
New Mexico, and had as their common
purpose curtailment of the power of
the American representative of the
reparative commission, an Interna
tional body set up by the treaty to fix
end-collect Germany's reparation.
The vote came sooner than had been
expected, the leaders agreeing to it as
part of a plan to complete the consid
eration of amendments as soon as
possible so that the senate might get
down to the real work of drafting a
ratification resolution. Only two of
the committee's 46 amendments now
remain to be considered and it is hop
ed lo bring tAenTId' 3 'Vote' eSflJ tffxT
week. They both relate to equalization
of voting strength in the league of na
tions.
Action on the two Fall amendments
came at the end of a session which
had been enlivened by a sharp debate
over the dispatch of American troops
to Europe for service in connection
with the Silesion plebiscite and by a
new move from administration quar
ters to meet the objections of Irish-!
Americans to the league covenant.
During the day some progress was i
made in the formal reading of the
treaty text, and the foreign relations i
committee took under advisement an
offer from Col. E. M. House to appear
before It.
In anticipation of a roll call, both
sides had mustered their forces in the
senate chamber as the time for action
on the Fall amendments approached.
As the resolution was put, however,
Senator Hitchcock of Nebraska, the
administration leader,, asked Senator
Fall whether It was his purpose to
request a roll call, and the New Mexi
co senator replied that it would be i
useless since he .realized the measures

CHICAGO, Oct. 17. The story
of how they repaired their dam
aged airplane in a Nebraska corn
field was obtained from the "fly
ing parson," Lt. B. W. Maynard,
and his observer, when they
passed through Chicago today. Ex
cept for the breaking of a crank
shaft in Nebraska yesterday, they
believed they were makingi better

CONFEENC
N
Withdrawing Former Motion, Employers Take Initiative
and Offer Resolution to Permit Capital to Use Own
Discretion in Dealing With Arbitration
Committees of Non-Interested Men.
WASHINGTON, Oct. 17. Without
reaching a decision on recognition ot
the- rights of workers to bargain col
lectively an issue which has been
the subject of two days' debate the
national industrial conference tonight
closed the second week of its delib
erations. Adjournment was taken
until Monday, when there is every
indication that the conference will
make a new start, a definite program
for procedure being in process of
formulation.
Withdrawing their motion made
yesterday to recommit the declara
tion on collective bargaining, the
employers took the initiative today by
offering a substitute resolution which
would protect their right "to deal or
not to deal with men or groups of
men who are not his employes."' The
withdrawal came as a surprise to
representatives of the public group,
Who were prepared to support it and
had expressed their willingness to
agree to amending of it.
The motion to adjourn until Mon
day, offered by Thomas L. ' Chad
bourne, a public representative, and
chairman of the central committee of
15, carried with it recommittance of
both declarations as to collective
bargaining to the central committee.
This committee will meet to discuss!
the two declarations if possible and
also to consider the new program,
which it was understood provides
that the issue of collective bargain
ing remain in the background until
some common ground can be reached
on the disputed propositions.
AtttyTETfrariiinuB of ttenate. Sam
uel Gompers, president of the Ameri
can Federation of Labor, who- re
turned to his seat in the conference
at ,the afternoon session after a
three days' illness, brought the dis
cussion to a climax with a heated
and eloquent reply to L. F. Loree,
president of the Delaware and Hud
son railroad and a representative of
capital.
Denying the assertion of Mr. Loree
that labor had taken advantage of
the war to force important conces
sions from the government, Mr.
Gompers declared that labor had
been actuated by the most intence!
patriotism during the war, and that
labor had made good its oledere of
co-operation tendered President Wil-j
son even before the nation entered
the world' conflict. But, emphati
cally declared Mr. Gomners, notice
ably weakened bv his recent illness,
"the masses of labor of the United
States have at last found their abil
ity to articulate through organization
and the time has come when in
America labor is determined to gain
a fair share of the rewards of its
toil."
Shaking with emotion and his
voice quivering, Mr. Gompers bitterly
was tightened and the engine was
ready.
"O. K., warm her up," said
Lieutenant Maynard.
Kline climbed into the cockpit
and manipulated switch and throt
tle until satisfied that the big
power plant was ready for his
chief. Then he scrambled into
the rear cockpit and dozed be
side Trixey. the German police
dog, while Maynard took up his
share of the race, fighting the
bumps in the air and worrying
about the route.
One reason why they are break
ing records is that Maynard does
a lot of things not taught or
countenanced in the flying schools.
Coming into Grant park ho had
too much altitude, officials Bald,
and according to the Hoyle of fly
ing, should have gone around the
field again.
Instead Maynard did a danger
ous looking skid one way, then
the other way and set hla -Mane
down. This doesn't taV6 long.
When time came for Maynard
to leave, he didn't run down to
the other end of the field and
"take off" into the wind. He
merely "gave er the gun" and took
off from that part of the field
where he happened to be square
ly across the wind. It was more

assailed Mr. Loree for his assertion
that there were, elements in American
labor that planned overthrow of the

Mr. Loree in his address demanded
that the government be given the
same access to the records and cor
respondence of labor unions that It
now has to those of corporations and
that generally the same regulations
that now surround capital be extend
ed to the labor unions.
Adjournment without a vote on the
collective bargaining issue was op
posed vigorously by the labor men.
Mr. Gompers demanded that the
gathering remain in session "until
the resolution is disopsed of." and
Daniel J. Tobin and W. G. Lee, the
latter chief of the railway trainmen,
held up the specter of numerous
strikes and impending strikes, now
in abeyance pending the outcome of
the conference, to induce the dele
gates to taek immediate action.

FRENCH WILL
FORCE ISSUE
Declaring that his action was
taken to force the issue la the com
plications -which have arises oat of
the tactics of I. C. E. Roberts, mem
ber of the board, in their attempts
to appoint a highway commission,
and to have some work performed
upon the eountyv toads which hate
been totally neglected since the Kins
has mixed the deal, R. N. French,
county attorney, issued a quo war
ranto yesterday to have the members
of the second commission transler
all papers and oUier matters in its
possession to the third commission.
While it is not believed that this I
proceeding will clear the atmosphere!
to any appreciable extent, It will at
least force the King and his assist
ant to take a definite step in clear-
' ing up the highway muddle. In the
meantime, however, the second com
mission is working . steadily on the
. preparation of a legal cas4 , against
the boar dof supervisors, with Frank

sion that there are three highway
Commissions in the field, a glance
through the records has revealed that
there are really four, as is shown by

ON THE THEORY THAT HE IS TOO
BIG TO MISS HUSSAR FROM THIS
CITY TURNED DOWN BY MARINES
The flest advertiser of the service, the U. S. Marine Corps, haa
sprung a new one in which this city ia mentioned as being the
home of the hero of the story. "Here it is as taken' from the
press agent of the Marine Corps af El Paso: "The bigger they
are,.the harder they fall for the marines." That's the conclusion
arrived at by Sergeant Alme Athenour yesterday when he was
forced td tarn down the application of William II. West (suppos
edly of .Bisbee,' although the city directory does not "contain his
name) because .William had humps on his back, from walking
under door tops. The would-be marine was six feet and eight
Inches tall. Which is seven inches over the prescribed height.
Sergeant Athemour and Corporal Thad Forney weie sitting in
the new marine recruiting station at 226 Mesa avenue Wednesday
morning when the room suddenly grew dark.
"Who shut the .door?" snapped the sergeant. Then he looked
op and aaw before him a human mountain. It spoke. It was
William.
"I wanta Join them devil dogs," said a voice so small that it
sounded liko a Ventriloquist doll, so the sergeant said.
Althenour looked over the recruit and thook his head.
"How much do you weigh?" he asked.
"Bout 200."
"Never- got Measured V
A yard stick, measurement of William showed six feet and a
fraction over eight inches.
"Sorry, can't take you," said Athenour.
And William took his hat and walked out without a word,
while the building shook.

iiee'ds voice, of course: -but other at
tributes exert so pronounced an In
fluence Upon sueceis or failure that
they will ever seem to me to be of
flr&t importance. To lnf. especially
in opera, presuppose . the possession
of voice by the oe.ndidr.te fcr oper
atic honors. I think It was because
I took this view of voice that I gave
prior heed to other factors without
which voice even if it be a great
one Is of small account.-
After I had jrlven up vaudeville
and had been studying with my New
York maestro for several wee!. L
went one morning to his studio. It
was a cold February day and a cat
ting wind blew me into the door
way from the street. I was still
shivering when I alighted from the
elevator and entered the inviting
ballv.ay where I removed my outer
wraps.
My ' raaetro seemed unusually
serious. My lesson had gone on
lor perhaps half an hour when he
paused, as he always did, to explain
what he knew it waa necessary at
a given moment I should learn.
"Rosa," he said, "there are two
'..ings which tha singer who would
go far must constantly heed."
I nodded. When my teacher be
gan his talks I was always . more
than glad to listen.
"Intelligence," he said, "is more
necessary than voice. And perse
verance in the application of intel
ligence that Is next Important.
Without the other each Is like a
ptrjon denied a staunch friend. But,
when they are combined, intelligence
and perseverance-carry us onward
toward the place our ambition has
carved out of future longings.

Whereupon, he again pointed out
the precise manner which the best
traditions decree these notes Should
b'j sung; the deliberate repose of the
style which is necessary shall be
preserved at those point.". There
was nothing wrong with the voice
ir.ielf, my maestro explained. It was
only in the way I ut'iiied it. and
my delivery of the text which re
quired correcting.

did persevere and for v months, in

That Is merely a single illustra

reach a desirable pofnt lit musical

BY CONDO
NEW YORK, Oct. 17. The results
of several of the football games to be
played on eastern gridirons tomorrow
will have an important bearing upon
the final standing of teams of this sec
tion at the close of the season. Pitts
burg and Syracuse, with records un
manned by defeat, meet at Syracuse,
While Cornell and Colgate clash at
Ithaca under similar conditions.
Chief interest will probably center
in the outcome of the struggle in the
Syracuse stadium for both Pittsburg
and Syracuse have powerful elevens,
ambitious schedules for the remainder
of. the season and two of the shrewd
est coaches in the history of the game.
The contest is likely to be one of the
hardest fought of the season with
Coaches Warner and O'Neill figuring
prominently in the result.
Colgate appears to be a slight "favor
ite to win from Cornell, due princi
paly to the defeat administered to
Brown a week ago.
The other important games in the
east Saturday follow:
Brown at Harvard, Swarthmore at
Pennsylvania, Boston Colleeg at Yale,
Rochester at Princeton; Penn State at
Dartmouth; Williams at Columbia:
Amherst at Trinity; Haverford at La
fayette; Albright at Lehigh; Holy

INCREASED PRODUCTION WORLD'S
GREATEST NEED
Increased production is the paramount need of the world.
Inadequate production is the basic cause cf the high cost of living.
Until world production is restored to normal, it is a question
whether standard living can be as high as it was in the years before
the war. '
High prices are but a way of manifesting a world shortage of
consumption goods. . . ; " , '
"We may eliminate all profiteering however defined sell all
the supplies the government still possesses at public auction, compel
the emptying of all storage warehouses, and we might lemporarily
reduce the level of prices by perhaps 2 or 3 per cent, though the
result would undoubtedly be higher prices a few months hence than
otherwise would be the case," says Prof. Moulton of Chicago.
Produce, produce, produce, must be the slogan of all patriotic
citizens.
Production will make us a busy people. Busy people are hap:y
people. Happy people are good citizens.
Strikes and labor agitation for abnormally short hours, higher
wages and less work are the main cause for decreased production.
WHY COPY AFTER RUSSIA?
The Plumb plan for disposition of United States railroads i3 that
the "workers must own the roads." The I. W. W. and Bolshevik idea
is that the workmen must supplant the present owners and managers
of all industries and be giwn the "full" return of their labors.
Lenlne and Trotzy accomplished this result in Russia and the
workmen ran the industries into the ground and themselves out of
a job.
Disciples of Lenine and Trotzky are preaching the same doctrine
to American workmen, but they do not explain that it is now neces
sary to try and bring back capital and managers to Russia to put life
into the industries wrecked under the workmen's management.
The reason for the failure cf the experiment is simply this:
Human nature is the same in Russia as elsewhere. Everybody
favored the socialistic regime when no one had anything to lose by
It. That is, everyone favored equal division when they had nothing
of their on to divide. Put as soon as a man obtained a little eco
nomic headway, he wanted to keep it; he did not want to divide it;
he resented being compelled to give up what he had made.
Lenine himself has ssmmed it up in a nutshell. He said, "As a
worker, the peasant is a socialist; but as a corn seller, he is bur
gcois." The rank and file of American workmen are well-educated men.
Surely they can see where the present prog-am of the radical labor
leaders and politicians will bring them.
Now is the time to listen to reason before we have a duplicate
of the Russian situation in this country.
WORLD PEACE AND INDUSTRIES
Earliest possible ratification of the peace treaty and covenant of
league of nations is of utmost importance fro the stabilizing of indus
tries and extension of American commerce. ,
Pending the battle in the senate, unnecessarily prolonged by a
bmall handful of ambitious men under the leadership of western rad
ical progressives, industries are not expanding and business drags.
Taking Oregon as a guide, where senators are elected by direct
vote of tho people since ten years, both senators, one a Republican
and one a Democrat, both prominent on committees, are supporters
of tho treaty.
With European nations needing peace and reconstruction, with
Great Britain unde'r the stress and strain of industrial revolution,
with our own country breaking up in mobs and strikes, it is time
to act. 4
The early ratification of the treaty and league of nations will
mean a great International steadying hand placed on the shoulder
of discontent, and a club to use against Bolshevism and anarchy.
Ask the most radical socialist or most vicious labor agitator what
he thinks of the peace treaty and league of nations he will tell you
it is the one thing to be defeated if the world is to be Russianized.
In the name of peaceful development of our great nation, for the
resumption of world commerce on normal bases, the highest patriotic
duty before Americans is to lay aside partisanship for world peace.
DRIVING BUSINESS AWAY
Newspaper dispatches recently carried a story' of a prominent
moving picture actress flying over New York, and the statement that
her managers carried 1100,000 insurance on her life during the flight.
Tho point that interests American business men is that American
insurance companies were not ready on short notice to carry aerial
accident insurance, hence the matter was arranged by cable without
delay, through Lloyds, the famous English company.
America today netds one hundred more insurance companies, but
there is no chance of getting them for the simple reason that we
have so many restrictive laws here that it is almost impossible to
start a new company and capital cannot be interested.
England is much more liberal and encourages tho insurance
industry. The only kind of regulation which should apply to insur
ance companies is such as will keep them financially sound for the
protection of the injured. Aside from this they should be encouraged
to expand in order to handle American business.
Competition and experience will take care of the rate question.
Cases similar to this one occur every day on account of American
companies being tied hand and foot with regulations which prevent
them from meeting new conditions hurriedly.
The laborer is worthy of his hire, provided he is one who can he
trusted to do good work without conr.tant and minute direction by
the boss.
; When labor desires a raise.it must fight for it. But when capitnl
desires more, it merely multiplies the price by two.
If the flight of military plane across the continent accomplished
nothing more, at least it gave our poor minds a rest from considera
tion of the seuate's stupidity.

INSPECTION RESULTS
OF MIAMI DAIRIES
MIAMI, Oct. 17. E. W- Wright, the
Miami sanitary officer, has just re
ceived from W. A. Barr, state dairy
inspector at Phoenix, reports on sam
ples of milk taken from each of the
dairies which serve milk to customers
in Miami. Two or three cf the dairies
teceived excellent showings from an
alysis of milk taken as samples, the
greater number averaged fair, while
a few were poor. Nearly all showed
up well in quality of milk as to rich
ness butter fat but some fell down
in purity. In one very small dairy the
analysis showed an alarming number
of bacteria, which was due to the fact
that the dairyman had allowed a pile
of manure to accumulate near where
he milked his cows. The sanitary of
ficer has forced a general clean up of
this particular dairy and warns all
dairymen that samples will be taken of
milk from all' dairies in future at least
once a month and no warning will be
given of the time of taking these
samples. After analysis by the state
dairy commissioner the dairies which
do not come up to the requirements
as to richness and purity will be fined
heavily, and if they appear unable to
reach the requirements of the state
dairy law offending, dairies will be
closed and forbidden to sell milk in
M iami.
PHOENIX TO RAISE
$50,000 FOR Y. M. C. A.
PHOENIX, Oct. 17. In an effort to
lift the burden of debt which has hung
over the Phoenix Y. M. C. A. since its
organization, it was decided last might
at a meeting of the board of directors
to hold a campaign to raise $50,000.
The campaign will be held from No
vember 12 to 18. J. O. Sexon, secre
tary of the "Y" stated last night that
the debt which has been hanging over
tho institution has held back its ac
tivities to a great extent. It has been
till the "Y" could do to meet the in
terest on the debt. $30,000 of which
has been in existence since the build
ing was erected. Ten thousand dol
lars was added .to the original debt
when the second story was put on. The
other $10,000 which it is planned to
raise, will be used in enlarging the
boys work department. This depart
ment is suffering from lack of space,
its work being greatly handicapped at
a time when there is a great demand
for it. Mr. Sexon stated last night
ihat he was aware that he had a great
campaign on his hands, but that he
was confident that the people of tho
city would support the local institu
tion as they have in the past.
ciation was completed by six residents
of Mesa,whc for some time past have j
been working on the plans. They are:
George A. Johnson, manager of the
Toggery; H. L'. Chandler, manager of
the South Side Gas and Electric com
pany; W. R. Stewart, Mesa realty
man; W. E. Walters, cashier of the
First National Bank of Mesa; L. J.
Barden, Mesa capitalist, and G. W. Sil
verthorn, attorney of Mesa and city
counsellor. The" association is capi
talized for $250,000, all of which has j
already' been subscribed, according to
the announcement. It consists of 2500
shares of a par value, of $100 each.
According to estimates furnished by
realty exports,vthe initial capital of the
organization will permit of the con
struction of upwards of fifteen resi
dences of the best type. Following
this initial construction the regular
revenues of the company will permit
of tho construction of several addi
tional homes each month, so that a
continuous program of construction
for the entire year will be assured and
to that constant building operations
for those seeking homes in Mesa will
be a matter of definite future.
county had been dismissed as a de
tail. Suddenly during the week they
were' confronted with the record of
delinquency, some extending as far
back as 1913, and it is said that oth
ers who have been delinquent for
many years more are due for an
awakening. As the result of the cour
teous notes requesting the money,
there has been a stream of taxpay
ers, who never before paid, in the
county treasurer's office, and the
checks already received amount to
more than $10,090, money that the
treasurer would, in all probability,
never have, received had he not asked
for it.
Underwood demands immediate action on the treaty on the ground
that every senator now knows how he is goiug to vole. Isn't that
too sensible to be sUtetmaiuhip?
MESA PLANNING BUILDING
ASSOCIATION FOR HOMELESS
MESA, Oct. 17. Relief for the
homeless is in sight today and immed
iate relief for many families who have
been seeking homes in this city is
assured within a short time, through
the report issued this morning that
organization of a building and loan as
sociation for this city has been com
pleted, and that work on -new homes
will be started within the next few
weks. The organization will be known
as the South Side Building and Loan

coupled with an attachment upon (he
three Balmer claims in which the
company held a half interest by pur
chase of Ihe Belmer interests in the
claims. '
The suit was filed by Richey &
Richey, as attorneys for William L.
Wakefield. As a first . cause of ac
tion, the plaintiff alleges that the
company at tempted to hold the per
sonal mining tools and camp equip
ment of Ira Lambing and Wakefield,
on the Lambir-g-Wakefield claims,
for which damages of $500 is asked.
A payment was due, itis alleged, on
October 9, together with a payment
of $70 per month called for by the
contract. ' The payment en the prop
erly was to have been around $13,000,
of v.hich Wakefield was to receive
seven-tenths.
On Ihe failure to meet Ihe pay
ments, notice was served by Richey
& Richey on the Consolidated Na
tional bank (hat the contract to pur
chase was canceled. Notice was also
served on the Iteiniger-Freeman Min

DELINQUENT TAXPAYERS IN

RED CROSS XMAS SEAL
CAMPAIGN OPENS SOON
PHOENIX, Oct. 17. With Governor
Thomas E. Campbell as honorary
chairman an Col. Epes Randolph of
Tucson as active chairman, the Red
Cross Christmas seal sale campaign
was received this morning at the of
fice of the association here in a wire
from Miss Carol F. Walton, execu
tive secretary. Miss Walton and
Stanley C. Wood, state director, went
to Tucson last Saturday and have
since been conferring with Col. Ran
dolph in regard to plans for the com
ing drive. A chairman is to be ap
pointed for each county of the state
and these county chairmen will work
with the state chairman towards mak
ing this drive the most successful
of any year.
Col. Randolph is well known all
over Arizona as the president of the
Arizona Eastern and Southern Pa
cific of Mexico railroads, and the fact
that a man of his executive ability
has been secured as chairman is very
gratifying to the association. Gover
nor Campbell has written the Anti
Tuberculosis association expressing
his appreciation of the valuable work
they have accomplished and pledging
the support of the stale board of
health in their campaign against the
great white plague.
Misses Walton and Wood are in
Douglas today, and after returning
here Tuesday evening for a day, will
leave for Prescott Friday evening to
assist in the organization of the work
there.
OUT OF TOMBSTONE
The roads are all to be fine, they say,
With four commissions to pave the way
Four that Adams and Roberts know.
One for work and the rest for show!
Sure, when -the job has been finished quite,
The county lanes should be out of sight.
With twenty commissioners on the rail.
And none of them certain of his soul.
Four commissions, all brave and true;
What will Adams and Roberts do
When they have to put up with one alone,
To haul the stand and crush the stone.
To fix the pavements and mend the ruts
That Adams has made with his "ifs" and "buts"
With the words he mouths and the song he sings:
. "Adams and Roberts Highway Kings!"
PEPY'S DIARY IN BISBEE
Oct. 17. Up betimes, and with only half a night's rest, to go to court at
Lowell, where a shooting affair was tried, wi;h a deputy sheriff on the short
nd of the string. Did hear Mr. French, the cour.ty attorney, and Mr. Mur
ray argue learnedly about the law, which would have been mighty interest
ing if I had not slumbered through most of the discussion. Remained there
so long, however, that I could gather little news, but was heartened by a
slight libation which I stumbled upon in a most gratifying and satisfying
way, v.hich will make my wife cause to lecture me tomorrow, but I am glad
she cannot pull my hair much more, having wreaked sad havoc with that
adornment of my youth. To "Chesterfield" Webb, who sells cigarettes, hav
ing a most wonderful and entertaining flow of language, and a pleasing per
sonality withal Wish he knew my wife. Did see three mighty hunters
come in from the hills. With their guns, shooting jackets, valises, shells,
boots and a most potent run- for snake bite that they had, they came, after
careful computation, to more than six hundred pounds avoirdupois. The
results cf Ihe hunt were eight ounces of duck, four ounces of dove and an
ounce and a half of quail, which maketh me to believe that the birdies got
the worst of the deal. To the job man, who told me how he had bought a
dress for his wife, and hew she did not like it, and lnw she brought it back
to the store, and exchanged it for a silk shirt for him. Think now that
there are wives and wives. To the Y, where I played a little billials, and
then to the Y. W., but afeared to enter, mindful of the libation I had had a
little while before, and having no cloves. Thence to the office, where there
was much work, but little cf interest," except that I was cautious all night
long as to how those hunters were going to divide the spoils. So to bed.
still wondering if thi cashier has really aa engagement ring, which. will
bother me, I think, until'I learn the truth.

Hints For Planning Heals
MENUS FOR ADULTS PREPARED
By LOUISE SPORLEDER,
Home Demonstration Agent.
If one who boards regularly at the
restaurants will listen to the orders
of men and women, this is what he
will hear, especially at luncheon:
One large T-bone steak.
One order French fried or shoe
string potatoes.
One serving apple pie.
Coffee.
This from the man).
Vhile from the woman:
One combination salad. .
Potatoes.
Possibly some meat.
Ice cream, or cake, or fruit.
While at first glanc -we might
think that the man had ordered more
sensibly, yet we will find that the
woman's order was better , suited to
bodily needs.
Muscular activity greatly increases
an individual's energy requirements,
while the sedentary occupations, such
as bookkeeper, cashier, teller, stenog
rapher and operator demand little
more food than would 'be needed ir
the person were sitting at rest.
Muscular work is usually graded as
light, moderate, active, or severe.
Light exercise is that which is inci
dent to sedentary occupations, requir
in gabout one calorie per pound of
body weight per hour. Hence the man
pf sedentary occupation will require
2400 calories per day.
"Moderate" exercise signifies oc
cupations which involve active use ot
some .parts of the body while sitting,
standing, or walking, as in the case
of carpenters, mail carriers, house
workers, and others. Such exercise
means an expenditure of from 1 3-4
to 1Y2 calories per pound of body
weight per hour.
"Active" exercise is sufficiently
great to develop muscular strength,
as in farmers, masons and black
smiths, and requires, during active
working hours, an expenditure of
from 1 3-4 to 2 calories per pound
per working hour.
"Severe" exercise indicates very
heavy muscular work, such as that
done by lumbermen, excavators and
stevedores. As much as 3 calories
per pound of body weight per hour
is required in this case, or 4000 ca
lories per day for the average man.
Estimated:
Sleeping, 8 hours,-. cal. per pound.
Sitting or standing, 8 hours, 3-3 cai.
per pound.
Light exercise, 8 hours, 1 cal. per
pound.
Moderate exercise, 8 hours, 1 cal.
)BEZ
per. pound.
Active exercise, 8 hours, 2 cal. per
pound.
Severe exercise, 8 hours, 3 cal. per
pound.
One can easily' determine how many
calories he will need per day, pro
vided he is of average weight and
height.

The most Wholesome and the most nourishing of all foods, is today
the only economical food.
BREAD has not increased in price like other foods. Your loaf to
day costs only a few cents more than before the war an advance
that represents the increased cost of labor more than anything else.
So BREAD, the Staff of Life, is within the reach of everybody.
Eat BREAD MORE BREAD instead of the richer, higher priced
foods, and you will cut down the high cost of living, and be health
ier and happier.

NEW YORK, . Oct. 17. Trtding in
stocks today was dominated to a great
er extent than at any period by the
unrestrained operations of pools in
specialties, particularly miscellaneous
issues of comparatively obscure origin.
Dealings in stocks of that descrip
tion frequently overshadowed the de
mand for recognized leaders. Some
of the latter, notably steels, were in
clined to react, but came forward in
the general rally of the last hour.
For the first time this week the
money market evinced a tendency to
relax. - Call loans opened at yester
day's ruling rate of 10 per cent, but
dropped to 6 per cent when a promi
nent local bank offered large sums at
the latter figure.
Time funds held firm at 7 per cent
bid, but so far as could be learned, no
loans were made tt that quotation,
even for the shorter terms, although
commercial paper; was freely purchas
ed at 514 to 5V2 Per cent.
In eluded, among the many strong
but "hitherto inactive specialties were
Pullman Car", National Aniline, Cali
fornia Packing. Blown Shoe, Endicott
Johnson, Haskell Barker, Transue and
Willims, Steel-May Department Stores
and Bosch Magneto at gains of 3 to 10
points.
Better known industrials, motors
and specialties were represented by
Pierce Arrow, Stutz, General Motors,
American Woolen, Hide and Leather
preferred, Central Leather, Industrial
Alcohol and National Lead.
Shippings were active, mainly on
the strength of Atlantic Gulf and
United Fruit and rails owed their 00-
casional prominence to Southern Pa -
cific, which made an extreme gain of
almost 3 points. Sales amounted to
1,325,000 shares .
Liberty bonds were lower on the de-
cline of the 3's, and, the domestic
list as a whole was irregular, foreign
Issues holding steady. Sales, par value
aggregated $12,750,000. Old United
States bonds were unchanged on call.
DUN'S WEEKLY REPORT
NEW YCRK, Oct. 17. Dun's tomor
row will say:
No important branch of enterprises,
either In the producing or distributing
field, wholly escapes the deleterious
effects of fhej.icontinued widespread
unrest of labor which, prevents the i
general expansion of commercial aa
tivity that
stimulate.
stable conditions would
lines in the east have aggravated an
already serious unsettled situation,
causing freight embargoes and further
delaying deliveries of essential com
modities and the threat of a walkout
of bituminous coal miners on Nevem
ber 1 is another disturbing element.
With many thousands of workers idle,
outputs are not alone restricted and
paucity of supplies intensified but In
creased firmness is imparted to
prices and Dun's list of representative
wholesale quotations which recently
disclosed a preponderance of declines,
now shows more advances than reces
sions. Considering the different handi
caps that beset business. It is remark
able that so many advices are of a fa
vorable and optimistic tenor.

t46. THE CORN MARKET
CHICAGO, Oct. 17. Expected cur
tailment of receipts did a good deal
today to put new strength into the
corn market. Prices at the finish al
though unsettled were lc to lc net
higher, with December $1.24 to
$1.24 and May $1.22 to $1.23. Oats
closed unchanged to c up and pro
visions varying from 12c decline to
75c advance.
Traders in corn seemed much Im
pressed by an ' official announcement
that railways would classify wheat as
preferential freight This was taken
to indicate that the movement of corn
to primary markets would be neces
sarily restricted, andthat manyy short
sellers of -corn might experience diffi
culty in fulfilling contracts. Bulls
asserted also that farmers were syste
matically holding back shipments and
that with cotton near the highest
price ever known and with other com
modities toward the top, no important
decline was to be expected in grain.
During the last part of the day, how
ever, some reaction took place owing
to fresh concern over President Wil
son's health, especially ' the chance
that surgical treatment for him might
be required.
Firmness of oats came chiefly from
continued export bidding. Profit tak
ing sales, though increased on the
bulge.
Provisions were strengthened by
upturns in the value of hogs and corn.
Besides, packers bought lard rather
freely.
WOOL MARKET
BOSTON, Oct. 17. The Commercial
Bulletin tomorrow will say:
"Business has been somewhat brisk'
er this week, more especially on scour

FI PKS FOR
IN THE DISTRICT FIXE
The Fair Price board for this local
ity met yesterday and the list printed
herewith is the one which was passed
upon by the board and which will be
adhnd to by all concerned. By
mean? of this list it is hoped to elim
inate any chance of gouging or over
charging by any merchant in the dis
trict. Any one wno Is charged over
the schedule following should imme
diately report it to Dr. Bledsoe, who
is the people's representative on the
board, and a complete investigation
will be made at once. The list given
below, it was stated by E. D. Camp
bell, secretary of the .board, will hold
good for the next ten days to two
weeks. As the market varies, the
list will have to be revised either up
ward or downward, said Mr. Camp
bell last night, but at the present
these prices will hold good.
"Due consideration has been given
to the class of service rendered by
the grocers in particular, so as to
differentiate between the cash and
carry and the full service grocers,"
said Mr. Campbell. "The consumer
must also take into consideration the
grades of merchandise. Descriptions
of groceries as listed" are specific,
but it is almost an impossibility to
fully describe in the limited space
alloted a list of this kind the various
grades for dry goods and wearing ap
parels except in the most general and
broad terms. However, as already
stated, we expect this present list not
to vary from the figures quoted for
at least ten days to two weeks."
