CHICAGO, Sept. 6. Two .men
of the name of Wilson were taken
into custody today in connection
with the planting of a bomb in the
federal building on Wednesday
and both have been identified as
having been in the postoffice

killed four persons and maimed
many others. The city police do
not charge that either man was
implicated in the plot, but States
Attorney Hoyne said one of the
Wilsons was the man who placed
the bomb.
John W. Wilson was arrested

NEW YORK. Sept. 6 Jules
Jusserand, the Frenech ambassa
dor, in an address before the ban
quet of the Franco-American so
cieties asserted that "the enemy
is doomed," and we "shall choose
and appoint the day for peace."
The banquet was part of New
York's celebration of the 161st
birthday anniversary of the Mar

anniversary of the first battle of
the Marne.
M. Jusserand paid tribute to
America's efforts in the war,
showed the insincerity of former
German peace offers and predict
ed that the enemy's next peace
offensive "will fail as well as his
other offensives."
Tonight's meeting was only one
feature of the program. At an im
pressive ceremony in the city hall
were read messages from Amer
ican and allied leaders, all ex
pressing confidence in ultimate
victory.
One from Marshal Forh assert
ed that, if the allied dead open
their eyes "they would see the

were from President Poincare,
Marshal Joffre, General Pershing.

ing, requiring 36 hours and 56 min

time was consumed in an overnight

ing been driven 150 miles out of
his course yesterday at Pittsburg.
Australian Troops Cross Som-
me on Wide Front South of
Peronne; Huns Burn Stores
of Munitions and Supplies
WITH THE BRITISH ARMY IN
j FRANCE. Sept. 6, (By the Associated
I Press.) Substantial advances again
&fe reported all along the southern
part of -the line. The Australians
have crossed the Somme on a wide
front south of Peronne and have driv
en into enemy territory. St. ChristI,
Brie, Les Mesnil, Doignt and Athies
wood all have been taken. Progress
is reported east of these places.
The enemy has been driven from
east and northeast of Peronne. Over
the whole area from which the Ger
mans are retreating on this large sec
tion of the front many fires are rag
ing and numerous explosions have
been heard. Villages are aflame be
tween the British positions and the
Hindenburg line here and in the
northern areas the Germans are burn
ing quantities of materials.
The British have reached the
Athies-Ham road and are on the east
ern outskirts of Bussu. At Nurlu there
has been heavy fighting. Strong Ger
man forces, fighting desperately with
machine guns and trench mortars
have caused the British to pause.
Along the whole front from the
southern extremity to the Bapaume
Cambrai road the enemy artillery fire
is dwindling away, indicating the Get
mans are making strenuous efforts
to get their guns back of the Hinden
burg defenses.
In the Queant area the British, aft
er severe fighting, occupied the ridge
, south of Moeuvres and captured more
German posts around Havrincourt
wood. South of Havrincourt wood the
advance north and south of Equan
court met with heavy resistance. Just
east of here the whole town of Fins
is aflame. This resistance probably
was offered to give a chance to the
destruction squads in Fins.
British posts west of the canal Du
Nord, north of Inchy, have been push
ed forward, but patrols on the west
bank of the canal were heavily fired
upon from the east bank. One of the
j British patrols crawled across a dam
aged bridge and captured an enemy
outpost asleep. The British pounced
upon the sleeping Germans and cap
tured them.
In the north, where the British are
reported to be making advances, more
fires are raging. In many places
north of the Sensee river the Germans
for several hours have been firing
thousands of gas shells so indiscrimi
nately as to make it appear that they
are trying to get rid of them.
A number of fires have been report
ed in the area south of the Esatires
Armentieres road. There have been
three counter attacks against hill 63
and the surrounding positions. Two
of these broke down completely, but
during the third, north of the hill, the
British were compelled to fall back
slightly.

While no one in Arizona was re

exist in the federal labor agencies,
there were 145 of the sorest men in
Bisbee and Douglas yesterday morn
ing that could have been discovered
in all the land. They had gathered at
the behest of the federal agencies in
this county, prepared to go to Port
land and Astoria, Ore., to work in in
dustries directly connected v.ith for

at the depot in Bisbee and the re

Postpone shipment to Tuesday of next

"CROAFF, 6 P. M."
This message, evidently a night let

acted on by him at Douglas, while at
the same time he sent, through the of
fice of the trainmaster at Douglas, a
wire to the conductor of the stub train
on which the Bisbee contingent was
to ride to Osborn, instructing him
that the men were not to be carried.
R. J. Wilbert, local member of the
Bisbee-Douglas community board who
was in charge of the men here, had
a stormy session for a time, but prom
ised to do what he could to straighten
the matter out. He and Mr. Ashurst,
after conferring by telephone, took
the question up with Governor Hunt
in Phoenix, to learn whether there
was any responsibility for this delay
In Arizona. The governor replied that
Mr. Croaff was doing all that he could
to expedite the shipment of the men
as originally intended. No one In Ari
zona was responsible in the least for
the disconcerting incident.
Late yesterday arrangements were
made whereby part of the state con

Overwhelming Defeat for Ad
vocates of Booze Witnessed
in Senate; Goes Next to
President
(By Review Leased Wire)
WASHINGTON. Sept. 6 The
$12,000,000 emergency agricultural
appropriation bill, with its rider
for national prohibition from neJ
July 1 until the American-armies
are dt mobilized after the end of
the war, was passed tonight by the
senate without a roll call.
Before final passage of the
measure, the senate voted. 15 to
6. to retain the prohibition rider.
A final effort to postpone the ef
fective date of the "dry" legisla
tion to Dec. 30. 1919. was defeated.
The bill now goes to the house, and.
because of the many amendments in
serteJ by the senate, it undoubtedly
will oe sent to conierence. i romui-i
to agree to the "dry" rider so that !
there will be no possibility of chaaces:
being made by the senate and house'
managers.
Senators voting asatnst retaining
the "dry" legislation in the bill were
Brandegee of Connecticut. Gerry ofi
Rhode Island, Phelm of California.!
Pomerene of Ohio. Ransdell of linis
iana and Underwood of Alabama, w hile j
it was announced that many members'
absent and paired favored the amend
ment.
As returned to the house the pro-!
hibition clause a compromise effec-!
ed last week by the senate "wet" and '
'dry" leaders would stop the sale of j
all intoxicating beverag's next June'
30 except for export, medical, sacra
mental and other than beverage pur
poses, and would pronmit me manu
facture after next May 1.
The compromise prohibition "rider"
was regarded as me most imporiani
provision of the emersency agricul
tural bill. It is a substitute for that
of Representative Randall, adopted by I
the house last May prohibiting use
of the br.l's appropriations until tne
president should exercise his author
ity In th food control law to stop
manufacture of beer and wine, as well
as whisky, during the war as a food
conservation measure.
After the passage of the bill the
senate conferees all regarded friend
ly to the legislation were appointed: I
(lore of Oklahoma. Smith of South,
Carolina. Smith of Georgia. Ken) on
of Iowa an l France of Maryland.
How long the bill would be in con
ference was regarded doubtful. Pro
hibition advocates believe it soon will
go to the president, who participated!
in conferences culminating in the son- j
ate compromise for extension of the :
effective date. The war revenue bill j
and house plans for a recess were ad- j
milted obstacles. I
Eleventh hour efforts to extend ihe'
time for manufacture of beer nnd winei
and disposal of stocks of intoxicating'
beverages were furibx. The sen.ite
rejected without a roll call an amen I
ment by Senator Phelan of California1
to make th" provision effective Vac.
30, 1919.
The senate rejected. 3fi to lf. an 1

i commission to report to congress the

ti l which J'd the cieViM m had
been reached at conferences be
tween Iresident Wilson and rep
resentatives of the fuel, food and
railroad adininistratif.i? and th
war industries board.
Factors which influenced the
decision to prohibit the manufac
ture of beer after December 1. the
food administration announce
ment said, were "the further ne
cessity of war industries for the
whole fuel production capacity of
the country, the considerable
drouth which has materially af
fected the supply of feeding stutrs
for next year, the strain upon
transportation to handle neces
sary industries and the shortage
of labor caused by enlargement
of the army program."
Warning was issued to manu
facturers of all beverages and
mineral waters that for the same
reasons there will be "further
great curtailment, in fuel for the
manufacture of glass containers,
of tin plate for cups, of transpor
tation and of food products m
such beverages."
Action along this line, it was
said, has been expected by the
brewing interests in view of thet

NEW YORK. Sept. 6. Another im
portant step toward the conservation
of credits for all but essential and
productive purposes was taken to day
when the stock exchange adopted a
resolution authorizing daily investiga
tion of its members' loans.
This action. It Is generally believed,
will result in a further pronounced
curtailment of speculative activity, if
not a gradual reduction of brokers'
loans to nominal dimensions.
Authorities pf the exchange were
Quoted as saying the situation pre
saged nothing of a disturbing nature,
but publication of the resolution was
succeeded by a volume of selling, in
which many important mocks fell 3
to 5 points under final quotations of
the previous day. During the morn
ing moderate unsettlement occurred,
especially in the transportation group
because of the dissatisfaction express
ed at Director General McAdoo's form
of rental contract.
United States Steel bore the brunt
of the onslaught as usual, suffering
an extreme setback of points iv
110, from which it rallied a point.
Other industrials, equipments and
numerous specialties forfeited 2 to 4
points, but rails recovered moderately
at the end. Total sales amounted to
820,000 shares.
The bond market developed a reac
tionary tone as stocks yielded, but
losses in that division were relatively
light. Sales, par value, J7.75.000. Old
United States bonds were unchanged
on call.
GRAIN MARKET.
CHICAGO, Sept. 6. Corn developed
noticeable strength today, influenced
more or less by scarcity of contract
supplies in store here. The market
closed form. c to c net higher
with October $1.58 to U-hS'A. and
November $1.56 to 1.56. Oats
gained a shade, to e. In provisions
there was a loss of 25c to $1.
Reports showing that the stock of
corn in Chicago elevators contained
only 184,000 bushels of contract grade,
put the bears at a disadvantage from
the outset. In addition, country con
signtnent notices remained light, and
receipts here jvere small. Frosts last
night in lower Michigan and western
Nebraska tended also to stimulate de
mand, as heavy rains of late and the
unseasonably cool weather were said
to have hindered the new crop from
maturing, and to have Increased the
likelihood of damage. Eastern millers
and commission houses with south
western and Omaha connections were
conspicuous buyers. A reaction which
took place during the last hour was
due to realizing.
Oats were upheld by the strengtn
of corn. Most of the trade was local.
Slowness of cash demand led to
sharp liquidation in pork and ribs.
Both staples underwent a maxicum set
back. Lard displayed relative firm
ness, owing to a moderate call for
spot.

Another I. W. W. trial will be staged, be
ginning September 24 at Wichita, Kansas.
The "workers" are charged with attempt
ing to hamper and slow down the output
of oil and coal in the Kansas-Oklahoma
fields; also with sabotage and interference
with supplies needed by the government.
About thirty leaders will face trial. The
case against them is very strong, as several
trunks full of their literature were seized by
government agents at the time they tried
to stir up strife and call strikes in the oil
and coal fields. They were most unsuc
cessful as they admitted in their letters and
statements, the workers refusing utterly to
be led by them from the path of duty. Then
the leaders called for more agitators and
more literature. Then the government
hawks swooped down on them, and the
cases now in court at Wichita are the final
result. The Kansas authorities evidently
used more advanced and successful meth
ods in the very beginning of this effort to
create a reign of terror than were practiced
by Arizona authorities a year or more ago.
In one of the captured letters a wobbly
complains that "we are arrested and frisked
by the cops as soon as we land in any town.
If a man has an I. W. W. card it means he
goes to jail. It would be a good plan, to
organize some new kind of union to get by
these big guys." A little over a year ago
I. W. W. leaders showed their red cards
broadcast over the state of Arizona with
much pride and boastfulness, and certainly
with impunity. All the strikes in the cop
per mines of the state last year could have
been saved if the police of every camp and
city, backed by state and local authority,
had arrested every red card man and thrown
him in jail. We were too lenient with them
in this state. They had too many friends
among the politicians. But up in Kansas
they nipped the entire conspiracy in the
hud. The plot against the Kansas-Oklahoma
oil and coal fields was a part of the
great plot, against the coal, oil, copper and
lumber output of the west that meant so
much to Germany. Another letter found
on a wobbly in Kansas said: "If we work
fast we can have everything here so they
can't turn around without asking us what
to do." It is easy to recognize the wobbly
boastfulness here. With the mass of direct
evidence against them, the Wichita trial of
these wobbly leaders is sure to put the fin
ishing touch to the great work done at the
Chicago trial.
One of the most encouraging signs of
the times is the governmental declaration
that Browning machine guns are now be
ing furnished the army at the rate of from
fourteen to sixteen thousand a month. It
is aso stated that most of our army divisions
in France have been supplied with the
Brownings. With the Germans depending
almost altogether upon machine guns in
their defense and retreat, this vast output
of Brownings, a far superior gun to any
the Germans can muster, is most vital right
now, for it means that in machine gun duels
our men will be able to surpass the Ger
man at his own game. All through the war
the German has had the advantage over
the allies in the matter of machine guns.
The American Lewis gun, purchased in
large quantities, helped balance the scale
for the British, and lately the French have
been making a fine machine gun in great
quantities. With the Browning gun out
put at its present state the allies will soon
out class the Hun at his favorite outdoor
sport. It has been stated that in a recent
struggle the Germans had a machine gun
to every soldier in line, depending upon
them altogether in lieu of rifles. The allies
have captured some seventeen thousand
machine guns in the past month.
Some kind and thoughtful sympathizers
of the wobblies convicted at Chicago last
week write to the editor of the Review
to rail him to task for misquoting the lines
at the head of the editorial last Sund-iy on
the Landis sentence. The lines in question
were, "The mills of the gods grind slowly
but they grind exceeding fine." The wob
bly sympathizer encloses a verse about the
"mill of god" which he fondly imagines and
even alleges was the proper quotation the
editor had in mind. The fact is the quota
tion was taken from Homer '.s Illiad and was
written several hundred years before the
Christian era, having to do with the Greek
gods alone and not our God. This par
ticular line of Homer has been paraphrased
and plagiarized and parodied and copied by
scores of writers ever since it was written,
but the original stands as written, a master
piece without a rival and without a peer.
It applied so exactly and so well to the
Chicago sentence that this editor could not
forebear to quote. The quotation stands in
the face of any literary wobbly sympathizer
whatever.
WHAT EIGHT BILLION
DOLLARS REALLY MEANS
(From a Bulletin of the Rureau of Internal Revenue.)
To collect within a few months eight
billion dollars is the task confronting the
Bureau of Internal Revenue. This is the
amount the new revenue bill now being
framed is expetced to yield. It is difficult to
realize the immensity of this sum, and yet
eight billion dollars is less than one-sixth of
the annual income of the United States. If
divided according to population it would
mean a per capita tax of $76.76 Or more
than $336 per family. The amount of
money in circulation August 1, 1918,
among a population cf 106,012,000 was
$52.44 per capita.
The total value of all crops on Ameri
can farms in 1910, the latest census year,
was five billion dollars. The total value of
all live stock on farms January 1, 1910,
was slightly less than three billion dollars.
In one year, therefore, the taxpayers are
called upon to (pay more than the aggre
gate value of all farm crops in the United
States in 1910, plus the value of all farm
animals.
The tax amounts to practically one-third
of the total value of manufactured products
as reported to the Census Bureau in 1914
$24,246,435,000. The value added to
raw materials by manufacture, which rep
resents the wealth produced by manufac
turing was in 1 9 1 4, $9,878,346,000 or only
23.4 per cent more than the proposed tax
levy.
These figures are represented, not with
the view of preparing the American people
for heavy sacrifices, but to bring home to
them a sense of their responsibility in the
way of necessary economies. The new rev
enue bill is being drawn in a manner to im
pose the least burden possible. Every man
will be assessed according to his income
each will be called upon to do his share.
The amount of federal taxes collected
from all sources during the last fiscal year
was $3,694,000,000. In collecting more
than twice that sum this year, the Bureau of
Internal Revenue is anticipating no unusual
difficulties, but is prepared to benefit by
past experience. The force of office and
field employes has been increased from ap
proximately 4,500 to 9,000 and the entire
administrative machinery put in readiness
for its task. t J 5J$3?3
"In normal times federal taxes are in
consequental and impose no burden on the
taxpayer," said the Commissioner of In
ternal Revenue, Daniel C. Roper, in com
menting on the work ahead of him. "Their
collection is a simple matter, involving
principally routine work. But this year we
are engaged in a war upon which depends
the safety not only of the United States, but
of the world. I believe the majority of
taxpayers now understand and appreciate
more than ever the objective the collec
tion of a fund every dollar of which goes to
the support of American arms and the
speedy conclusion of the war."
HIS LIFE TO HIS COUNTRY
(From the Literary Digest.)
Private Edward J. Farrell of New York
City, who was killed in action July 13, in
his will, which was made public by a friend
recently, included this paragraph:
"To the little old United States I give my
life willingly, because she is the grandest,
greatest, and freest country in the world.
And I hope to God that the day will come
when she will be indeed 'America for Amer
icans' of undivided allegiance."
Philadelphia North American: Labor's
attitude apparently is that it is willing to
work or fight if it may pretend it doesn't
have to.
HUNT'S MACHINE IS
IN BAD CONDITION
FOR THE PRIMARIES
Phoenix: Signs are many that the
Hunt machine is breaking up.
The candidacy of Colter has been a
serious disappointment. The latest
hantr on to quit the Apache Senator
is John Dunbar, who has gone over to
Usborn, where the money seems to be
(lowing more freely than in the Col'er
camp. With Winsor, Roberts and Dun
bar all disaffected over the Colter can
didacy, the machine is lumbering alon
undjr the direction cf Leroy LaJd and
Louis Lowenthal, trying to pack the
I. W. W. load, but having rough going
Sutter has profited more than Osborn
by the division of the Hunt camp
and the Cochise senator will now prob
ably carry Maricopa county.
Hunt is remaining faithful to Colter.
Roberts has been lukewarm ever since
the governor refused to approve nim
as p. successor. Homer Woods of
Prrscott is still loyal and doing every
thing he can for Colter In the north,
with the result that the forces there
have betn fairly well held together for
the man from Apache county.
The result depends largely on Co
chise. Gila and Greenlee counties. If
Colter can hold down Sutter's Cochise
plurality to less than a thousand and
sweep Gila and Greenlee counties by'
larce pluralities, he will win. :
The general concensus of opinion Is'
that the fight is still between Colter
anj Sutter, although friends of Osbori
have been trying to create the impr?s
sion that the secretary of state Is in
the running by reason of the dhision
in the Hunt camp.
The following counties will probably
be carried by Colter:
Apache. Navajo, Mohave. Coconino.
Yavapai, Pinal, Greelee and Gila.
Sutter will get Maricopa by a small
plurality, Cochise and possibly Pima.
Osborn will probably pet Graham,
Santa Cruz and Yuma, the later be
ing dependent on Mulford Mansor, who
is having the fight of his life there
bfth for Osborn and for himself as he
is opposed for the namination for state
senator.
The political prognosticators all nd
mif (hat mistakes ar liable to be
made in figuring up the line up. The
SUTTER SAYS HIS
ELECTION
CERTAIN
(Special to The Review)
rilOEMX, Arix., Sept. 7. Senator
Fred Sutter, candidate for the demo
cratic nomination for governor, today
gave out an interview here in which
he claimed that he will be nominated
next Tuesday and gave a forecast of
how the counties will vote.
In his forecast Sutter claims six of
the fourteen counties for himself. He
conceeded two to Osborne and two
also to Coulter ;two he says are in
doubt and two .more are practically
a stand-off letween himself and Coul
ter. He declined to estimate the plu
rality in the counties but is decidedly
the most optimistic candidate in the
field at this time.
The counties which Sutter claims
for himself are Navajo, Maricopa,
Pima, Greenlee and Cochise. To Col
ter he gives Apache and Mohave coun
ties. Osborne he says will carry San
ta Cruz and Yuma. Yavapai and Gllu,
het says, are a standoff between him
self and Colter. He classes Graham
and Pinal as doubtful.

Haymarket riot bomb tome thirty
years ago. States Attorney
Hoyne said tonight that this Wil
son had been identified to his
satisfaction as the man who ran
from the postoffice a few minutes
before the explosion.
Both Wilsons proclaim their in
nocence, despite long questioning
by the police and federal and
county detectives. Mrs. Spies was
also taken into custody as was
Mrs. Minnie Wymann, at first
said to be a sister of Haywood,
but later described as a friend of
the I. W. W. secretary.
Mr. Hoyne's statement says
that Harry Wilson was seen near
the federal building ten minutes
before the explosion, carrying a
package that seemed to be heavy.
He said another witness says he
saw him place a bundle by a radi
ator near the Adams street en

before the explosion. A receipt
found in his pocket showed that
he had paid the expenses of an
an I. W. W. meeting last Sunday

attention to the fact that the men had
in most cases given up lucrative em

work for the government. Most of

Doan's Kidney Pills off and on for j
several years and they have always I
given me good results. Whenever I
take cold and it settles on my kidneys,
my back begins to ache so, 1 coula

to float before my eyes. I surely feel
miserable when I get these attacks,
but Doan's Kidney Pills quickly re
move every symptom of the trouble.
I can then do my work and 1 feel
fine."

I am taking this means of telling
the voters cf Cochise county know my ,
position as regards the I. W. W. and !
other pro-Germans. I have been asked
this question frequently and my re

citizen and that the welfare of my
country is receiving my first consid
eration. I do not consider an I. W. W.
anything but a pro-German and
against the government. I wish to
make my position clear and will state
that I am making this race for sheriff
of Cochise ccipnty depending upon the
votes of the loyal American citizens
and that the I. W. W.'s can cast their
votes for the candidate in this race
from whom they can expect considera
tion as they will not get it from me
if I am elected sheriff.
Trusting that I have made myself
clear on this point, I remain.
Yours very truly,
