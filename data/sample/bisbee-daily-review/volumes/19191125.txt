the percent of wage advance needed
to meet higher living cost, great sig

in 1917, should not exceed the present

UNITED AMERICANS, FORMED TO
FIGHT RADICALISM IN STATE
Declaring that the great menace to
American institutions iry Is not
Bolshevism or any of its forms, but
rather the indifference of Americans
themselves to the principles of their
government, and that this indifference
has jesulted in the unrest which has
beenaparent in various pans of the
United States, Frederick Vining
Fisher, noted author, lecturer and
scholar, delivered a rousing address
yesterday Afternoon to more tnan it0
prominent business men at the Y. M.
C. A. The lecture was delivered in
advocacy of the "United Americans,"
a patriotic society which is being or:
ganized to combat radicalism and to
give to non-service men and women
the same opportunity to advance the-
principles of Americanism as is given
to ex-service men by the Aemrican
Legion. .
Dr. Fisher's talk was a comprehen
sive survey of conditions in the
United States and the remedies which
must be applied to such social sores
as . have become apparent. He laid
stress upon the fact that Americans
will not tolerate government by the
labor unions, by radicals, by religious
bodies, or by any one set or clique
of men, but will demand that govern
ment by all the, people.
"Upon this principle," he said, "the
foundations of our government have
been laid, and these foundations have
become. In the short space of 140
years the foundations of government
for every free people on the earth. To
day there are but two iwrnis of gov
ernment the dictatorship of Russia,
and the democracy of the United

"Whatever may happen to me,"
the rebel leader is quoted as saying,
"I do not have to worry about my

In a telegram to General Dieguez,
Mrs. Angeles asked that her hus

SUGAR SHORTAGE IN DISTRICT
ACUTE; RUSH TO BUY CAUSES
UNEQUAL DIVISION IN BISBEE
That the necessary limiting of
sales of sugar during the present
shortage has caused an orgy of hys
terical sugar buying on the part of
about half the population of the
Warren district, and that if there is
any hoarding it is on the part of the
consumer and not the wholesaler or
retailer, were facts disclosed yester
day by inquiries into the generai
local sugar situation.
Inquiries yesterday also' revealed
that, far from a tendency to profiteer
in sugar on the part of lotfal mer
chants during the present unavoid
able sugar shortage, the current
price of sugar in Bisbee Is lower
than In other surrounding Arizona
cities and towns.
"There is a popular fcnpiession in
this city that there are on hand in
the district large stocks of sugar,
running as high as two carloads,"
said a local authority on the subject
yesterday. "This is not the case.
The limiting of sales to two pounds
to the buyer about two weeks' ago,
has caused an outbreak of hysterical
buying on the part of about half the
population of the district. These
people have been buying two pounds
in Bisbee, then two pounds more in
Lowell, and then a third two pounds
in Warren, repeating if they can.
"The result is that half the peo
ple in the district have been getting
all the sugar, while the other half
are facing a shortage. Although
sugar In any quantity is not in the
hands of the wholesaler or retailer
in this district, it certainly is in the
hands of the consumer."
Radical elements, it is said, have
been expressing belief that whole
salers and retailers are holding sugar
from the market with an idea of
boosting the price. - This is refuted
both by the comparatively low price
of sugar in Bisbee, and by the fact

that there is but a very small quan
tity of sugar in (lie hands, of the
local dealers.
The Phelps-Dodge Mercantile com
pany stopped selling sugar several
days ago, owing to the tendency of
the commodity to find its way into
the hands of about one half the
consumers, while the other half went
short. Yesterday was the last day
lor holding the sale of sugar in
abeyance, and this morning it will
be on sale again at . the Phelps
Dodge store.
The purpose of the company in
holding up sales for a few days was
in order to give every consumer a
fair start in purchasing. Inquiry
proves that the Phelps Dodge Mer
cantile company, in its Bisbee, Low
ell and Warren stores combined has
now on hand a supply of something
less than 250 sacks of sugar, which
is a very limited supply.
In spite of this limited quantity,
thci Phelps Dodge stores will sell
sugar again this morning at the same
price which they were charging be
fore the temporary holding up of
BUgar sales. The amount for each
purchaser will be limited, as before,
to two pounds. Every consumer will
be given a chance to get a fair
start in the buying, beginning this
morning.
Selling of sugar on this allotment
basis is declared to be absolutely
necessary,, as the local sugar situa
, tion is grave. Statistics -show that
more sugar has been shipped into
Bisbee district during this season
than for two seasons previous, ft
is not considered probable that the

BIGGEST NEWSPAPER FEATURE
of the Year Begins In
TODAY'S REVIEW
"I would rather have this book published than anytning that
has ever been written about me," were almost the last words of the
late Theodore Roosevelt, when Joseph Bucklin Bishop was com
piling, under the ex-president's supervision, Roosevelt's letters to his
children. :
Mr. Bishop has now completed this work, and today the RE
VIEW, together with a lrge number of larger newspapers through
out the country, begins the giving, to the public of these letters
for the first time, in serial form... The REVIEW has secured
through the N. E. A., the exclusive publication rights for these
letters in this district.
Public libraries in ll parts of the country report that the de
mand for all books on Roosevelt exceeds the supply... Inquiries oan
ceriing the letters of Roosevelt have been . pouring in from thou
sands of readers. It has been impossible to get the .letters In
Bisbee in book form. The REVIEW is therefore offering its read
ers not only the greatest newspaper feature of the year, but a
feature otherwise unattainable in this district.
The letters, covering twenty years of Roosevelt's life, while
his children were growing from babyhood to young manhood or
womanhood, reveal ever 'the big-hearted tenderness of Roosevelt
the husband and father, showing a side of the Rooseveltian char
acter t'o which the public has hitherto had no access... They show
how netiher the battlefields of Cuba, the heaviest affairs of state
nor the fiercest political battle could interfere in the least with
his joyous love for his sons and daughters, and his enthusiastic
sympathy with all their activities.
Be sure not to fail to bealrf today to read in the Review the

MIAMI, Nov. 24. The Superior &
Boston have started regular ship
ments from the ore body recently
discovered in the foot line vein, hav
ing already shipped two cars. The
first car gave a return of 35 oz. of
silver per ton and 9 per cent copper,
and mine samples indicate that the
second car will run about the same
in silver, hut will go around 14 per
cent or 15 per cent copper.
Work along the strike of the foot
wall vein has not disclosed the ex
tent of the ore shoot as yet, as the
west face shows four feet of copper
glance. t
This is one of the most important
happenings in the Copper Hill dis
trict in some time, as it not only
shows that valuable ore deposits are
to be found on the property of the
Superior and Boston, but that the
management has outlined and Is car
rying out an effective development
program. Besides the development
work that led to the discovery of
commercial ore in the foot wall rein,
the company is carrying on a great
deal of development work in other
parts of the mine which is of Dig
importance and will be watched with
much- interest.

MESA FACING FAMINE
OF THANKSGIVING SWEETS
MESA, Nov. 24 Cakes and candies
for (he Thanksgiving dinner and
evening, will be more scarce this
year than ever in the past. This was
the prediction this morning of local
bakers, candy manufacturers and
dealers, and "grocers. Lack of sugar
in all parts of the country, and the
actual famine conditions in the west
and. southwest, are pointed to as,1
reasons for the scarcity .of .sweets.
Candy manufacturers throughout
thi3 tcrlitory are raced with the pos
sibility that they will have to resort
entirely to syrups and other substi
tutes to be able to meet "any of their
former trade, while' it is possible
ihat the chocolate cream iind other
candies which require large amountsj
of sugar, will disappar for at least a
snort time. ) . , "
Bakers of ihe city fear that lack
of sugar will prevent their making
i-ny eupcial - effort to cater, to the
needs of the. T'nafckpgiving public. It
ii highly probable, they state, that
no cakes nor pies, nor candied cook
ies, so popular for holiday occasions,
will bu produced .this week...
SONORA 'PROHIBITION" LAW
IS PARAGON OF WETNESS
NOGALKS, Nov. 24. Upon the
publicist ion of the new Sonora liquor
regulation law in the official puper
of (hat state, Sonora will become six
per cent "wet," generally speaking.
Wiiile the law is designated as a
prohibition law, popular interest in
Ihe measure has been aroused by
what it permits and on the Arizona
side or the line it is regarded by the
thirsty as a beneficent permissory
law rather than a drastic prohibitory
law, for it is said by experimenters
that one may "get fou and unco
happy' on a six per cent baek-itction
brew.
Moreover, while the manufacture
and sale of intoxicating beverages
containing more than six per cent of
alcoholic eonlent is prohibited, wines
made from grapes, cidr, and cham
pagne are specifically exempted from
tin inhibition, so the Vin Sisters are
singled out for favor by the Sonora'
government.
While THANKSGIVING DAY is
distinctively American, its scope has
broadened since that November day,
at Plymouth, when the Pilgrim Fath
ers with grateful hearts for their
deliverance Trom the shackles of
civil and religious servitude, render
ed tribute to Him who had guided
them to distant shores and a land
destined to become the refuge of
the oppressed of all the world. Tuily
they had much to be thankhi! for.
and in reverent spirit they acknowl
edged their dependence upon that
power, the wisdom of which passeth
all human understanding. From
their sturdy stock conies the nucleus
of the virile American nation of. to
day and to it we owe those con
cepts of government and human con
duct which have set us aside and
marked us as a people peculiar unto
ourselves. Since then wc have
passed t-hrough the fiery furnace of
war several times, triumpning be
cause our cause was just, r.nd iO-
finin'g our national spirit in separ
ating the dross from the finer metal.
On each occasion" we have emerged,
not only conquerors in a physical
sense, but imbued with better and
higher Ideals of the duty we owe
to society and government. Our ma
terial progress has kept pace with
in fact, exceeded our spiritual ad
vancement until today it is our proud
and indisputable boast that we are
the richest and most powerful , na
tion in the world. If we use, as in
the past, . these instrumentalities in
the proper way, we may go forward
to our destiny in hope and confi
dence that the perpetuity of Our in
stitutions is assured. If we misuse
this Gcd-given power, then we have
just reason to face the future of ap
prehension. The past year has given us mani
fold reasons to be thankful. From
a feeling of Insecurity brought about
by the close of the Great Conflict,
and the necessity of re-adjustment
to new conditions, we have finally
found ourselves, and placed our feet
on solid ground, sustained by the
thought that the Puritan spirit still
animates our body politic and makes
for that which is good End worth
while. Bountiful harvests have been
our portion; our mines have yield
ed their treasure- and provided em
ployment at good wages for every
man who desired it; farmers and
merchants have prospered and we
have been a happy and contented
people; the relations of labor and
capital have been amicable betoken
ing approach of a better understand
ing of the rights of each; seditious
organizations have not openly sowed
the seeds of discord, and those who
oppose the government have found
this is not the fertile field it once
was for their nefarious work. Many
of our sildier boys have returned to
us and again taken their places in
civil life. Their fidelity to the frov
ernment has had a heartenin? and
strengthening effect upon those dis
posed to lean toward the crop of
isms which seemed -wiih startling
suddenness to find root in the soil
which we believed to be indigenous
only to the growth of sane civiliza
tion. The mothers and fathers of
these boys have just cause to re
joice and be glad over ihe roiurn
of their loved ones, but vhile wc
join in their paeau of thankfulness,
we should let memory turn in sol
emnity to the poppy-covered fields
of France where sleep our honored
dead, thanking. God that it was
through their great sacrifice we aie
permitted to observe this lime-honored
occasion.

Audience Held in Grasp By
Superlative Excellence of
Great Artist's Display
Of Technique.
BY MARY F. G. CUNDIFF
Kudolph Ganz, the Swiss pianist, in
concert at the Grand theater last even
ing was accorued a most enthusiastic
wetcome by a group of listeners which
ixed the capacity of the house. From
tne moment the artist played the first
notes of the Liszt "Variations a Bach
Motive," until the final notes or the
immortal "La Campanella," he held
me audience In his grasp by superla
tive excellence.
Mi. Ganz has no mannerisms. Ob
viously his rt is a serious business
and he needs nothing of the unusual
to recommend It. . He plays with a
delightful simplicity, with extreme
delicacy, giving each note its rull
value and always a clarity and dis
tinctness which is conspicuous.
The program last evening was es
pecially enjoyable. In his well chosen
numbers there was a freshness and
one listened with rare pieascre to
compositions heard in concert not
often enough.
The heaviest number was the Mac
Dowell ' Sonata Eroica Op. 5f" in
five movements. In its varying moods
Mr. Ganz was faithful to the theme,
giving tone pictures as sharp as if pro
duced with brush and canvas. In the
music of the American composer there
is a particular significance and the
setting forth or the Jieauty of it is
timely as well as attractive.
Two original compositions, one a
"Cappiicio" Tor the right hand alone,
were especially attractive. One mar
veled at the skill of the artist as the
wonderfully expressive fingers of a
single hand brought out the theme
with exquisite shading and apparent
ease.
The program last evening left the
appetite whetted for more while giv
ing a certain satisfaction on Its indi
vidual merit. The Musical Eventst
club of the "Warren district is to be
congratulated on its initial event and
the music lovers will eagerly antici
pate those in prospect. Even the
most stout objector to the use of su
perlatives might easily weaken and
become extravagant in describing the
art of Rudolph Ganz.
No job of printing too email, none
too large. If yoa want it done right

HIGH GRADES
IN PRACTICAL
MINING COURSE
That the oral examinations which,
when passed successfully, will result
in certificates of ability and person
ality for the holders, and which, with
the written eiatniifations to follow
will complete the work of the 1919
class in the Copper Queen Practical
Mining couise, are preceding rapidly
and successfully, was the announce
ment made yesterday by G. S. Dickin
son, educational director for the Cop
per Queen companies. A particular
item of congratulation, according to
Mr. Dickinson, comes from the fact
that shift bosses and miners who are
taking the examinations are making
high grades, although the examina
tions are thorough and, in school boy
phrase, "stiff."
The examination board is headed by
Mr. Arthur Notman, mining superin
tendent of the Copper Queen compa
nies, and includes several other ex
aminers. Mr. Notman propounds the
questions, which cover all the sub
jects of the year's course, and he and
each examiner grades the answers as
they are made. From these grades
Director Dickinson compiles the aver
ages. It is believed that the oral exami
nations will be concluded about De
cember 4 and that the written exami
nations will begin about December 8.
All the men of the night shift will be
examined in the written tests at one
sitting, which will be held in the high
school. The men of the day shift will
follow. Writing materials will be fur
nished to the students. The examina
tions will cover, as in the case of the
oral tests, the matter included in the
seiies of lectures which makes up
the course.
About 64 men are eligible for the
examinations, while this year's class
is averaging about 158 members:

BY EARLE (GREASY) NEALE
Coach of Marietta Football Team
Baseball is my profession because
that is where I get my living, but if
the choice was left with me I'd say
football every time. I'd rather coach
a football team than play baseball.
Once a footballer, always a foot
baller. The old fight and spirit make
the game, and keep a fellow in love
with it forever.
Football is 40 per cent coaching and
physical ability. The other 60 per cent
of fight and determination you suc
ceed in instilling into the players be
fore your big games. I have talked
to players before big games and had
half of them crying. Then they went
out and mopped up the grjeiron with
the other fellows.
There is a lot of difference between
football and baseball. In football you
win if you have the materia and the
best coached club. In baseball it is
uncertain. You can try as hard as you
will in baseball and yet not accom
plish much if the breaks are going
against you.
It is easier for me to coach a foot
ball team than any otb.er branch of
athletics. To begin with you must, of
course, have good material. Then you
must give the men plays for their size
and speed. If it is a light club you'll
give them plenty of open plays. If
heavy they'll get plenty of line plays.
If both heavy and fast a mixture will
do.
I coach my men to catch the foot
ball with their hands much as an out
fielder catches a baseball. I haven't
had a punt dropped on me In five
years. ,.-,.
I have one system of defensive play
that I use for all opposing formations.
I have only one defense for forward
passes.
I never taught my men to "get" a
star player of the opponenls. I teach
them only one thing and that is to
win that it is no use to play on a
loser.

A THOUGHT FOR THE DAY
"Small aid is wealth
For daily gladness; once a man be done
With iiunger, rich and poor are both as one.'
-EunpeUes.
THE SUGAR SHORTAGE.
IT IS A SIGNIFICANT FACT that the price of sugar is lower in
Bisbee than in any other surrounding cities. This is a practical,
unanswerable refutation of the insinuation that local wholesalers
or retailers are holding back sugar with the purpose of raising
the price in face of the present shortage. Hut few cases of profiteer
ing in this commodity have come to the attention of the authorities
in other Arizona cities, and with the price even lower here, there
can certainly be.no profiteering in Bisbee.
The allotment of a maximum of two pounds of sugar to the con
sumer here is unavoidable. There is really a big shortage of sugar
in the Warren District. The bankers have been cut down to the
minimum supply with which they can conduct their business, so im
portant to the community.
If the twe pound allotment is taken philosophically by r.U con
sumers and reasonable economy practiced in the household, iMsbee
will pull through the present shortage with a minimum of discom
fort. Hysterical buying, hoarding by the consumer and attempts to
beut the a'lotment plan will not serv2 to alleviate the situation.
THE I. W. W. IN PHOENIX
IT WAS TO BE SUSPECTED that in a state whose major industry
is metal mining the I. W. W. would still be organized, even though
quiescent, says the Phoenix Gazette. We take the declaration of
Gannon, alleged secretary for the I. W. W. in this state, about a
statewide sliike with a grain of salt, as also his assertion that the
I. W. W. are well organized. Experience in the past has shown that
while the I. W. V. are quite capable of starting a strike in one or
more camps, the "statewide" character of the movement exists- only
in the hopes of a few leaders and that said movement soon runs up
agaiurvt a stone wall of Americanism on the part of workers and
communities.
However, Gannon speuks true to type. He says that "it is only
by assuming an aggressive attitude, constantly and repeatedly ask
ing, seeking, fighting for more money and improved conditions that
we can he of greatest benefit to our members." Interpreted in the
light of I. W. W. history and doctrines, 'this means continual indus
trial unrest until, total anarchy Bolshevism is achieved.
Thi constitution of the I. W. W. and other literature are freely
and openly circulated in Phoenix and. we assume, el.sewhere n the
state, without interference on the part of any authorities. That con
stitution still asserts that the working class and the employing class
have nothing in common and that the struggle must go on until the
wage system is abolished, until the workers of the world organize as
a class and take possession of the machinery, of production. . That
is the Utopia that was realized in Russia, with the result that the
machinery of production was scrapped and millions of people re
duced to a hell in life by force of mercenary toldiers in the pay ot
despots whose mildest governmental measures are murder and rape.
Governors in this and other states av asserting that the I. W.
W. must be cleaned up; that they are an outlaw organization which
must go. Arizona is a good field in which to carry on the cleanup
begun in the state of Washington.
No. 4, Cactus Way. Phoenix, where the I. Vr. W. maintains a
hangout, and its ramifications are again respectfully called to the
attention of the federal officials.

A THANKSGIVING PRAYER
THE FOLLOWING Thanksgiving prayer, officially endorsed by the
Inter-church World Movement of North America for use in the
churches of all Protestant denominations participating, bears a
lesson, in its sober dignity, its optimism, and its unostentatious
expression of love of God and country, for the malcontents, the
calamity howlers, and the labor trouble breeders who are at present
agitating the nation:
"Almighty God, Who in earlier days led our fathers forth into a
largo inheritance, give us grace, we humbly beseech Thee, to pass
thiough these days of tiniest and turmoil in confidence and courage
that what has been so well begun will come to rich completeness.
"Bless our land with the fruits of honest toil. Save us from the
discord which misunderstanding brings. Keep our feet in "the path
of righteousness. Teach tis to love liberty and justice and to prac
tice them to the upbuilding of the entire world as well as our own
native land. Fashion Into one people the multitudes brought hither
out of many countries and make them true Americans.
"Give us grateful hearts for the abundant harvests of the year.
In the time or our prosperity temper our self-confidence with the
recollection that 'every good and e ;?ry perfect gift is from above.'
Let no anxiety rob us of the consciousness of Tnine abiding love.
In the day of trouble suffer not our trust in Thee to fail. Be patient
with us when our purposes break down or our endeavors seem of
no avail.
"Go with us into Thanksgiving Day. Teach us to give thanks for
all the blessings of the time, to dread nothing but the loss of Thee
and to perceive the sut. of Thine enduring love forever shining
behind every cloud.
"Bless us all at the Thanksgicing Board. Be with those who
cannot be with us as well as those who can. Make us, wherever we
may be, one in that unity of hope and faith and love which neither
time nor distance can destroy. And send us forth into the future
with Thanksgiving faces and Thanksgiving hearts eager to labor,
strong to endure, and useful to the land we love. Amen."
CHEER UP,
F COURSE its gloomy weather. Tut it can't last, because it is
: not typical Bisbee weather. It is an even wager that the sun
will be shining today. What are three days of continuous rain
in Bisbee ' healthy young life? We need a little unusual
weather of this kind once in a while, just to remind us of the splen
did clinyite we generally enjoy here in Bishee to make us appre
ciate the blessings of such a climate, and keep us from taking it too
natch for grunted. And :?loomy fat c-j luU short tempers won't hav-'
any effect cn the weather pods. So forget your troubles, stop worry
ing about that rheumatism which , may bo brought on again, and if
the sky is leaden again tod:'-, just smile and s;ty: 'We ci.n't have

Nov. 24. Up late, after some trouble with the baby, whose stomach had
been crammed with candy on the day before, and to whom I gave a number
of pills and things that finally brought relief, both to me and the child. To

citvairg a tale about the two young women who own a cigar stand, and how
they were robbed of $3.50 in pennies, the thieves bfcing able to find nothing
else, which made us both believe that perhaps the real money had been hid

"makes her head save her heels" the
strain need not be great.
There are so many things that can
be done several days before THE

several days before needed, and the
turkey dressed and ready for stuff
ing two days.
On Thanksgiving morning allow
plenty of time for everything. To
have to work in a rush at the last
minute arranging the center piece
and setting the table will spoil your
own enjoyment in the dinner. You
know it's really a lot of fun to get

INTRODUCTION
Most of these letters were written by Theodore Roosevelt to his
children during a period of more than twenty years. A few others
are included that he wrote to friends or relatives about the children.
He began to write to them in their early childhood, and continued
to do so regularly till they reached maturity. Long before
they were able to read" he Bent them what they caUed "picture let
ters," with crude drawings of his own illustration of the written text.
. .
Deep and abiding love of children, of family and home that was
the dominating passion of his life. The children always had an old
fashioned Christmas in the White House. In several letters, descrip
tions of these festivals will be? found.
Through all his letters runs his inexhaustible vein of delicious
humar. All the quaint sayings of Quentin, that quaintest of small
boys; all the comic aspects of the guineapigs and others of the
large menagerie of pets that the children were always collecting; all
the tricks and feats of the saddle-horses these, together with every
item of household news that' would amuse and cheer and keep alive
the love of home in the heart of the absent boys, was set forth in
letters which in gayety of spirit and charm of manner have few
equals in uiterature and no superiors. No matter how great the
pressure of public duties, or how severe the strain that the trials and
burdens of office placed upon the nerves and spirits of the president
of a, great nation, this devoted father and whole-hearted companion
found time to send every week a long letter of this delightful char
acter to each of his absent children.
The strong, vigorous, exalted character of the writer stands re
vealed in these as in all the other letters, as well as the cheerful
soul of the man which remained throughout his life as pure and
gentle as the soul of the child. Only a short time before he died, he
said to me, as we were going over the letters and planning this
volume, which is arranged as he wished it to be: "I would rather
have this book published than anything that has ever been written
about me." JOSEPH BUCKLIN BISHOP.

It's me quickest pain killer known,
so be sure when you even suspect

It won't blister not even the tend

Use Begy's Mustarine, always in
the yellow box, to ease the pain of
rheumatism and gout.
Just rub it on for lame muscles,
sore feet, stiff neck, cramps in leg,
sprains and strains.
Get out the box promptly when
you have neuralgia, nuritis, lumbago,
backache, headache, earache, tooth
ache, or any ache anywhere.

made of real yellow mustard and
other pain destroying ingredients.

box equals 50 blistering Mustard
