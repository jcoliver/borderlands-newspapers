Captain Smith, Eastern Bound
Airman, Closely Pressed by
2 Competitors; All Expect
Reach Destination Tonight
CHICAGO. Oct. 1C Interest In the
great transcontinental air race at the
close of the third day centered to
night in the hitherto unmatched con
test of Lieut. E. W. Maynard. leader
of the westbound flyers, and Capt. L.
H. Smith, pace setter for the contin
gent from the west, either of wnosi
can reach his destination tomorrow,
winning first honors in the cross
country flight
Captain Smith, however, no longer
leads the eastbound group, for two
of his rivals, Lieutr E. C. Kiel and
Maj. Carl Spatz, overtook him late
today at Bryan, Ohio, where the trio
remained for the night. So either of
the three, good fortune attending
them, might easily first resell the
finish at Mineola, whence the west
bound men started. '
Lieutenant Maynard, the "flying
parson," whose matchless flight!
across the United States for three
days has thrilled aviation -enthusi-j
aets, tonight still easily led the west-7
bound contingent, although Capt am;
H. C. Drayton was a good second, 100
miles or more behind. The "sky
pilot" had chosen Salduro, Utah, 2183
miles from Mineola, as his night stop,
having left Salt Lake City at 5:30 p.
m., mountain time. He planned to
start from Salduro tomorrow morning
determined to reach San Francisco,
518 miles distant, before sunset The
"parson" continued to hold an advant
age over Captain Smith and his two
companions from the west, who had
covered 2051 miles from San- Fran
cisco when they stopped at Bryan,
Ohio, for the night. The lieutenant
had lost the morning due to a broken
radiator at Cheyenne, Wyo., and his
mileage for the day with Salduro as
his night control was only 487, while
Captain Smith, traveling from Omaha
to Bryan, Ohio, today, had covered'
591 miles.
Lieutenant Maynard left Cheyenne
at 12:35 p. m., mountain time, and
reached Salduro at 6:03 Pacific time.
Captain Smith left Omaha at 7:43 a.
m., central time, and stopped at Bry
an,' Ohio, at 4:50, central time. May
nard has 518 miles to reach the coast
and Smith 650.
Captain Drayton, second of the
westbound flyers, apparently had a
chance to make the best distance fot
one day when he reached Rawlins,
Wyoming, at 4:13 p. m., mountain
time, after covering 673 miles. He
planned to go on to Salt Lake City,
which would have made his day's
travel 960 miles, but finally, decided
not to attempt the additional "287
miles and remained at Rawlins.
Lieutenant Kiel ' and Major Spitz,
the westerners who overtook Captain
Smith at Bryan, Ohio, were nearly
matching Captain Drayton, for they
had covered 723 miles since leaving
St. Paul, Neb., this morning. Cap

Of course everybody knows

that Bisbee is in Lowell and the

WASHINGTON, Oct. 10. All of the
time set aside by the senate for con
sideration of the peace treaty today
was taken up by Senator Norris, Re
publican. Nebraska, with a tiiree
hour attack on the Shantung settle
ment and a half an hour's reading of
the printed text
When the Nebraska senator halted
Tor a moment with his speech only
two-thirda through, Republican Leader
Lodge gave him a breathing spell .by
suggesting that the senate shift to
the reading. Senator Norris will con
clude tomorrow. .
SenatoiTTJodge also may speak and
the senate will meet an hour earlier
than usual In the hope of speeding up
the treaty consideration.
The agreement for 11 o'clock open
ing was taken to indicate that the sen
ate will begin next week to put in a
longer working day with the hope of
clearing away the big speech, making
program. At the suggestion of Senator
Lodge the senate also adopted the
agreement to take up the Shantung
amendment Wednesday, but this does
not mean that they will be considered
under the five-minute debating rule or
that a vote is any nearer than It was
yesterday. Senators explained that
this procedure would enable the body
to revert to the section embracing the
Shantung provision, as the reading by
Wednesday may be way ahaed of it.

Hudson Tied Up
Account of StriKe
NEW YORK. Oct. 10. All ferries
plying across the Hudson river sus
pended service at midnight when the
crews walked out in sympathy with
the longshoremen's strike.
The longshoremen's strike by which
the port of New York has been vir
tually tied up and as a result of which
more than 40,000 men are idle, became
associated with great possibilities to
day when tho national adjustment
commission ruled against the coast
wide longshoremen on their demand
for an Increase of from 65 cents to $1
an hour.
The decision of the board was ren
dered following an all day session. .
with the object of capturing Mex
ico City before attempting opera
tions in the north.
The complete organization of
the 'junta de gobernacion" was
announced in dispatches carried
by the courier. The purpose it
has will be to take over the civil
administration of the territory aa
fast as it is occupied by troops.
Forces of ru rales in each district,
according to the plan, will be en
listed to police the districts and
release the military forces for
further operations. The enlist
ment of a large number of desert
ers from the Carranza forces, who
had been conscripted into the
army, has brought the forces un
der Villa and Felipe Angeles up
to nearly 100.000 men, the courier
further reported.

thirty kilometers from Riga, and oc-
! cupied Shlotsk, which is outside the
demarcation line, according to a re
port issued by the Lettish bureau at
Riga. The report adds that the at
tack was repulsed with sanguinary

The forces of General von der Goltz
include imperial German troops with
tanks and airplanes, says the report,
which adds that the Germans attempt
ed to bomb Riga, but were repulsed.
A state of siege has been pro
claimeed at Riga, as a precautionary
measure. Reserves are being formed
among those who are unable to go to
the front. Soldiers who were starting
toward the front were pelted with
flowers.
The Lettish bureau says the Ger

from Riga, and the shore of the Gulf
of Riga, and occupied the coastal
town of Schlotsk, and also attacked
the coastal town of Dubbelm, thirty

Previous advices from the
Baltic region have failed to mention
the commander of the Russian army
i nthe western provinces
The withdrawal of General von der
Goltz and the German troops under
his command from the Baltic region
of Russia has frequently' been de
manded. The supreme council at
Paris some days ago sent to Germany
was was considered in some Quarters
an ultimatum on the situation, threat
ening to cut off provisions and to In
flict other penalties if the German
government did not hasten the with
drawal. The German government all long
has claimed that Von : der Goltz's
troops were rebellious, desiring to re
main in the Baltic region, and that
they had persistently refused to re
turn to Germany and that Germany
had not the means at its disposal to
compel them to do so.
The latest German note on the
subject before the supreme council
in Paris declared that the pay of the
troops had been stopped and their
supplies and munitions cut off and
that General von Everhar naa Deen

same mistake that was not

cal men sumrP'jned as jurors
to Tombstone stand a good
chance of getting a free trip to
that place and 53 pay beside,
without doing a stroke of work

It is all because the. worthy

the national industrial conference

the . employers group declaring for
the principle of the open shop and
affirming that "no employer should
be required to deal with men or
groups of men who are not his em
ployes or chosen by and from among
them."
The latter principle created quite a
stir in the conference' and was con
sidered by some of the delgates as
approval of the stand taken .by Judge
Elbert H. .Gary, chairman of the
United States Steel corporation, in
refusing to meet the steel strikers.
Other principles enunciated in the
declaration of the employers includ
ed: .
Acceptance of the right of strike
or lockout, excepting in the case of
government employes; opposition to
sympathetic strikes and lockouts; In
sistence on the function, of manage
ment in directing idustry; emphasis
of shop unions as opposed to the in
dustrial councils proposed by organ
ized labor and a declaration that co
operative relations between capital
and labor should be worked out In
individual establishments with due
regard to local factors, Instead ot
along the lines of entire industries, as
suggested by labor.
"Hieh industrial efficiency" was
stated by the employers as the touch'
stone of sound Industrial relations.
After receiving the proposals of the
emDlovers. an hour's recess was
taken to permit the committee of 15
to brine in a report on the "one reso
lution" which, it was announced, was

Equalization board, means that such
over indulgence in sweets "must now
be curtailed in some sections of
the east for the next three months."
George A. Zabriskie, president of
the board, in a statement to the
press, declared that although the
talk of "shortage" persists, it was
a fact that from last January to
September, inclusive, 500,000' tons,
or 18 per cent more sugar had bean
delivered to American consumers
than for the same period in 1918.
The normal increase in consumption
for the period named, he said, would
have been 4 per cent.
The west should secur immediate
relief from the harvesting of an
average beet crop, said the state
ment, which will be in full swing
within a week. ?
After October 15 and until Jan

west of Pittsburgh and Buffalo(
and north of the' Ohio river will
have to depend upon the sugar beet
producers. Considerable more beej
sugar will be marketed this year

PITTSBURGH, Oct. 10. Senators
investigating the steel strike put in a
busy day in the Pittsburgh district,
and viewed everything from the In
candescent metal in rolling mills to
the culinary equipment in the homes
of mill workers. They discussed
strike conditions with plant supprin
tendents and hald informal caucus
with strikers in the back streets of
Homestead and Clairton.
Chairman Kenyon said they want
ed to b sure and hoar both sirt-s,
and volunteer and voluble interpre
ters made It easy for the foreign
born elements among Ihe strikers fo
get heard.
At Homestead just before the party
arrived there was an exchange of
shots between strikers and nn armed
workman, but the committee did not
get up to the front in time to see any
thing of the fracas.
In the mills of the Carnegie com
pany visited at Duquesne and Home
stead, officials would concede that
only a small number cf men were on
strike. At Clairton. however, the
senators were told, that 1500 men out
of 5000 normally employed remained
out. Strikers in the street meetings
with the senators denied these claims
and in polyglot fashion asserted that
many thousands of men were missing
from the scene of their usual duties.
Chairman Kenyon at Homestead
broke his party up into details of one.
which resulted in each senator gath
ering a crowd running up into hun
dreds at every front porch .where he
stopped. Senator Sterling of South
Dakota with a cluster of youngsters
hanging on his coat tails, was taken
into two or three homes In one block,
while one man acting as usher would
observe at each door, "Here's the way
some more of Judge Gary's high paid
help has to live."
Senator Kenyon called in a sten
ographer to take down some state
ments made by Mrs. Joseph Pentedi.
wife of a husky Hungarian mill fore
man, who refused to strike. She had
been visited. Bhe explained, by a
committee of strikers, and urged to
get her husband to stay away from
work. Pentedi, rather shamefacedly,
said that he had done so for a couple
of days "because I was afraid and
she was afraid."
At Clairton, some hundreds of
strikers crowded around the senato
rial party, under the leadership of
P. IL Gogan, secretary of a local
strike committee. There was some
wonderment among the committee
when Slavs still unable to speak Eng
lish gave their names as ".Tosepn
Powell" and "James Smith." but the
senators finally accepted the names
as an Indicaion of a first step taken
toward Americanization.

GIRLS HEAR
CALIFORNIA
If. 1. WORKER
The Business Girls' club of the
Y. W. C. A. met at a supper last
night and heard an interesting and
instructive talk by Miss Esther Day
man, Pacific coast girls' work sec
retary. Miss Dayman discussed th
position that women hold In the in
dustrial world today and told of th
movements that are now in progress
to further that position.
One of the most interesting fea
tures of the industrial movement
among women is that known as tha
Federation, an organization of wom
en wage earners. Miss Dayman
pointed out that the men- workers
have had such .an organization ' for
a long time and are far ahead' of
the women when it comes to or
ganizing for their own benefit.
Under the confederation the wom
en engaged in various Industrie
form themselves into clubs for the
sake of congeniality and advance
ment. The federation council meets
once a week and the entire federa
tion from time to time. In other
words it is a union of all women
wage earners.
The Business Girls club here has
not advanced to this stage, but Miss
Dayman pointed out , that their ex
pressed purpose was the same which
is for "the understanding, friend
ship and backing of all women" and
to "dignify labor among women in
industry."- Within the Federation
group are three trade divisions,
commercial workers, mercantile work
ers and factory workers.
The supper was well attended and
marked the inauguration of a series
of similar events which the , girls
all feel will be well worth while.

regarding the reportec aftvance of the

Riga. It has been believed that he
started three or four days ago on h!3
return to Berlin. It was known, how
ever, that there had been skirmishes
between detachments of Lttish and
German and Russian troops and the
indications were that it was the in
tention of the Germans to advance
through Letvia to co-operate with the
White Russian army who are fighting
the Bolsheviki. It is known tkat tne
Lettish troops lack the erganizatitn
to meet the German troops and that
therefore they had asked the aid of
Esthonian troops.

FAGE THREE
DDROTHYBERRY
BOUND OP TO
HIGHER COURT
PHOENIX, Oct. 10. Dorothy M.
Berry, charged with passing bogus
checks, was bound over to the supe
rior court, following a preliminary
hearing in Justice De Souza's court
on Thursday morning. Checks for
$69.90 and $10 .50. drawn on the First
National Bank of Nogales, dated
Sept. 9, and given to Korrick's store
in return for merchandise and a pair
of shoes, were introduced as evidence
by the state.
Miss Eland, a saleswoman of trie
New York store, testified that slie
sold Miss Berry clothing on Sept. 9
and received the larger ot the checxs
in return. Roy Hockey, shoe sales
man, explained that Miss Berry
bought a pair of pumps from him on
the same date tor $10.50, and asked
for a check from the bank at No
gales, as she had none in her posses
sion. The cashier gave her one on
the Glendale bank, which she mar
over.
Ed. C. Carter, general manager of
Koiriek's, then took the tand to tes
tify that the two checks had been
returned marked "no funds" from the
Nogales bank, and that Miss Berry
had never made them good.
A detailed statement of Miss Ber
ry's account of the First- National
Bank of Nogales from. May 20, the
day it was opened, until June 13, j
when it had dwindled to 22 cents, was!
given for the state by C. E. Wheeler,
assistant cashier ot the institution,
lie testified that Miss Berry depos
ited 5300 May 20, and $90 June 1, ana
that she had drawn this money out
in almost daily checks varying from
$1 to $50. The ledger sheet of the
young woman's account at the ban
was shown as evidence, with the pro
viso that it could be withdrawn.
Miss Berry, defendant In the case,
was the fifth and final witness in tne
hearing. With very few interrup
tions on the part of her attorney, W.
T. Sprowls, or County Attorney
Laney, she told how on July 12 sbe
loaned $500 to a Lieut. S. P. Bouvi
are, who came to hor on the verge oi
tears and told her he had gotten in;o
trouble over a delinquency in the of
ficers' mess funds of which he had
charge. The officer. Miss .Berry
claimed, gave her a solemn promrse
to get the 'money for her in a few
days. On Sept. 2, she stated, a letter
came to her from Lieut. Bouvlaru
stating that he had deposited $500 to
her credit at the Nogales bank on
August 25. She was unable to pro
duce the letter as evidence, saying
that she had destroyed it as of nu
account before her arrest.
Some Admissions.
That she had given 'the checks so
Korrick's in good faith based on tlie
officer's , statement, was the defense
made by the young woman. On cross
examination by the ec""- attorney
Miss Berry admitted that she had
given a check to a prescription druggist-
in Tucson after she had been
advised that her bank account was
reduced to a few cents, drawn on trie
Nogales bank. She also admitted
passing two checks at the Gadsden
hotel. Douglas, between the date wheh
she knew she had practically no
money in the bank and the date s,e
received the statement of a deposrt
from the army officer.
"Isn't it true," County Attorney
Laney asked with finality, "that you
left a train of spurious checks in your
wake wherever you went?"
"I don't think it is kind of you ?o
say that," the young woman replied,
drawing herself with a show of great
dignity.
During the coures of the cross e
amination of the defendant, she al
times flatly refused to reply to hrs
questions, and when requested to
write her . signature replied that she
would not do 30, since he already had
her signature on the two cueefcs.
When asked if she had cashed a
check with a G. L. Wands in Los
Angeles, she denied any knowledge
of such a person. She declared tliat
she was raised in.'New .York and had
lived all over the country, intimatlns
that she had come to' Arizona for tier'
health. She said she received money j
from her sister nd from an aunt. j
Unable to furnish bond. Miss Berry!
is still in the toman's quarters of tne)
county jail, attended by a matron.
The above story, of course, has nul
bearing on. the propriety of a deputy !
sheriff spending the night in-tne j
same room with Miss Berry at the
Gadsden hotel in Douglas, under tne :
plea that he was guarding hor. j

THE BRITISH RAILWAY STRIKE
T
HE first real battle in the struggle between Labor and the
present social state, in western Europe, has been joined. On
Saturday fthe negotiations between the railway men and the ;
British government collapsed, and the great strike was called
for midnight. Twenty-four hours later it was In full swing; and
it is difficult to see exactly where it will end. At present the
railway men have requested the transport workers to hold their
hands, but the younger element there, as on the railways, is keen
to force the issue. Mr. A. Smith, the general secretary to cho
latter union, has announced that he has the utmost difficulty In
keeping the omnibus, tram, and taxi men out of the fray, yet it '
is just such threats which lend additional color to the statements
which have been made by various members of the cabinet that
the issue is not one of Labor at all, but of revolution. Mr. Lloyd
George, in a telegram expressing regret for his inability to attend
the celebration of the return of the soldiers, at Carnarvon, has
vigorously denounced the action of the railwaymen. Never, he
declares, has he seen a strike entered into so light-heartedly anil
with so little justification, or with such an entire disregard jof
public Interest. It is no question, he insists, of a struggle be
tween the railwaymen and grasping employers. It is a struggle
with the state which is running the railways at a heavy loss
which loss is borne by the general taxpayer, and must eventually
be passed on to the public in the shape of increased fares and
charges. Nor, he goes on, is there any cause for the action of
the union, inasmuch as no reduction of wages can possibly take J
place until next year. Yet the strike was forced without notice
and in contempt of the week's notice demand by the men's con
tracts. Such being the case, he maintains, the strike is not an
economic one but a political one, and has been brought about by
the success of the extermists in gaining control of the union or
ganizations. In consequence, he concludes, the government is de
termined to resist the effort with every means at its disposal.
In answer to this Mr. J. H. Thomas, who represents- the rail
way men, replies that It is useless to attempt to maintain that
a strike which has been answered with such alacrity is not based
upon real grievances. To say that the disagreement Is not over
wages, he argues, is to ignore the fact of the obvious discrepancy
of men working side by side on similar jobs, the one at forty
shillings, and the other at seventy-one shillings a week. Under
such conditions, he declares, even if the executive had not called
a strike the men would have taken the law Into their own hands
and walked out. Mr. Thomas' argument, though it may be sound
as far as it goes, does not really answer the question. To begin
with, he does not explain to what extent this discrepancy in wages
occurs, and so give the public the means of deciding whether, on
the actual question of wages, the whole business , of the country
is to be brought to a standstill over the grievances of ten men
or a thousand, of a hundred men or ten thousand. The argu
ments of Mr. Thomas have been spplemented by those of Mr.
Cramp, the President of the National Union of Railwaymen. Mr.
Cramp admits that the men cannot hold out for a month, but he
declares that is a matter of no moment whatever, since ages be
fore a month Is over the country will be in a condition of starva
tion, and the government compelled to surrender. Being perfectly
certain of success the strictest orders have been issued against
picketing. The government will be allowed to run every' train it
can without interference, the men being perfectly conscious that
no "scratch" service can be instituted which will be In the least
effective.
WESTERN BEET SUGAR
T
,HE PAPERS are full of sugar shortage stories and state that
the western beet sugar crop will soon be pouring in to re
lieve the situation.
Whether there is a real shortage as critical as some would
have us think or whether the whole scare was brought on by the
move to prosecute profiteers in different lines of industry we do
not knew. v
The main point brought out which interests westerners is the
fact that due to increased consumption of sugar there is no prospect
of production increasing faster than demand.
Probably no Section of the world has the opportunity to de
velop the beet sugar industry to such a degree as western states.
No stone should be left unturned to encourage this industry
at this time as it is a land developed, a valuable adjunct of stock
business and a great employer of labor, not to mention a com
munity builder.
Rapid development of the candy industry in western states Is
a direct result of our sugar industry and with the elimination of
the special five per cent excise tax on candy this industry would
grow more rapidly than ever.

ALLEGED BOY FORGER
CAUGHT AFTER LONG CHASE
TUCSON, Oct. lO.-r-A man hunt
led" by Murel Berry) sixteen years
old, an alleged forger, closely tal
lowed.' by Victor Myerson, pf the
White, House store, started at the
Tucson National Bank about 4:30
yesterday afternoon, and with a hun
dred people following,' proceeded up
Congress street, turned the -corner
of Scott. 6ped toward fhe Santa Rita
raced through the Clark garage, up
the Tucson Seed company store.
There, Berry, the fugitive, apparently
disappeared.' No one saw where he
went. Mr. Myerson waited, sure ne
had the youth in the vicinity.
"There's a pair of boots sticking
out." said a little girl, in the back
of the store.
Myerson pounced on a pile of
sacks and. drew forth the fugitive,
shook him, called a taxi and took
the boy to the city hall. There
Berry was charged with the forgery
of a check given for goods bought
at a store run by Mr. Myerson' s son
in Meyer street, yesterday noon.
In his possession was found a pile
of checks already forged in the
names of a dozen prominent citizens
of Tucson, all drawn on the Tucson
National Bank.
When I was a boy and went to church,
9 I only went there to pray
To sit quite still in my Sunday clothes.
To hear what the good books say
To sing a hymn and recite a psalm
To nod through the sermon long
But now I go for amusement's sake,
And the tune of a popular song!
The preacher talks on the nations' league,
While a- saxophone murmurs low
The hymn is gone, but I listen now
To some jazz from a burlesque show.
There's a movie film in the deacon's room,
And a pool hall dowj below
But, nevertheless, I sometimes wish
For the church that I used to know!
PEPY'S DIARY IN BISBEE
Oct. 10. Up early, to go to Lowell with the boss, whom I met in a res
taurant eating waffles, and he told me some funny stories, although I think
I can best him. Back to Bisbee early, as our business was postponed, which
pleased me mightily, as it gave me a chance to stay home while my wife
marketed. This she did for about two hours, being well content to get away
from the children. The baby skinned her nose in the meantime, and several
dishes were broken in an attempt to get the jam, and then, she returned with
just what I cannot stomach for a meal. So glad to come to work. To Judge
Hogan, with whom I talked briefly, and then to the Y. M. C. A., where I met
Miss Gregovitch, who writes notes for the paper, and with whom I visited
pleasantly, though hungry. To Brewery Gulch, where I talked baseball witn
my barber, who also' shaved me well, at which I was well pleased, although
thinking that I should have gone to him before I went to the Y. Much gossip
this day about the coming boxing matches, with hopes that Dalton will
appear here. To Mr. Brooks, who is a right merry wight, and made me
laugh heartily at his quips. Noted here that I must remember some to put
in the paper, for I think he will not know I have stolen them if I wait long
enough, or else he will believe that I have the same book that he has. To
the depot, where I looked for news, but found none. Some near beer today,
but drank it with a wry face, so I doubt but that I have won the seller's
ill will. Worked steadily in the office, and thence to bed, thinking that the

AUTO OVERTURNS TO AVOID
CRASH WITH FIRE TRUCK
PHOENIX, Oct. 10. A sensational
flirtation with death was witnessed
by many passersby at the corner of
Fifth avenue ,and Madison street,
about 7 o'clock last night when a
Ford automobile in which H. B. Tan
nehill, Arthur Meyers and Tyer Ben
kee were riding, completely over
turned. Number 3 company fire truck was
making' a fast run east on Madison
street in answer to a false alarm,
when the Ford was almost directly
in front of the truck, turning iito
Madison street from Fifth avenue.
In order to avert the impending col
lision, Tannehill swerved his car too
sharply and it overturned. The oc
cupants were thrown out and es
caped with only minor injuries. Tan
nehill said a billboard at the inter
section of Fifth avenue and Madi
son street obstructed his view, and
he didn't know the fire truck was
so near.
Fire Chief Simmons said autoists
were constantly imperiling their own
lives as well as the lives of fire
man by refusing to heed the signals
of fire trucks on the run.
"Every automobile driver should
stop when he hears the first clang
of the fire gong and ascertain wheth-

A company was formed in this
city Thursday evening, the purpose
of which is to place on the market
an artificial stone which to all in

place of mother earth's product The
material from which this substance
is manufactured has been found near
Douglas in the shape of an exten
sive deposit or stratum which, when
treated under a special process
known only to those who formed the
company, is. claimed to be superior
in v some respects to the genuine
stone used f- building purposes. In
appearance the product of the fac
tory resembles white stone and by
tests has been proven to be fully
as well adapted to stand the wear

NEW YORK, Oct. 10. Bull pools
were in undisputed control of today's
stock market, the broadest and most
active session in several weeks, their
further operations in miscellaneous is
sues being well supported by exten
sive buying of representative steels,
coppers and rails.
The demand for steels preceded, the
publication of United States Steel ton
na.?e figures for September, showing
an increase of about 175,000 tons and
seooned to have its basis in favorable
reports from mill centers.
United States Steel made an ex
treme gain of 2 points to 1124, its
. best price since the inception of the
stri te and affiliated shares, especially
Harvester, Sloss-Sheffield, Crucible
and Hepublic were 2 to 5 points higher.
The same considerations probably
accounted for strength of steel and
electrical equipments, where gains of
2 to 7 points were made by General
Electric, Westinghouse, Pressed Car,
New York Air Brake and Baldwin Lo-
comotive.
V UnFon Facific overshadowed the
other rails, its 3 point rise being ac
companied by the heaviest transac
tions 5n many weeks. Mexican Pe
troleum featured the oils at the new
high of 2504. Sales 1,675,000 shares.
Bonds, excepting utilities, were
steady to strong on diversified deal
ings. Total Bales, par value, $12,450,

Labor -unrest and Inefficiency are
apparently the only clouds on the com
mercial horizon now that living cost
agitation has waned and prices seem
to have reached an equilibrium. Some
old strikes as for instance that in the
steel industry have lost much of their
power for unsettlement, but those of
longshoremen at New, oYrk and San
Francisco, haveaimed a new blow at
the country's export business, while
printers and pressmen continue appar

try at the country's largest city, to the
benefit of other centers where union

Still the country's trade despite ob
stacles and : uncertainties as to addi
tional ultiate costs forced by unrea
sonable labor deands sees to forge
ahead slowly'' few cities, but so

CHAPTER VI Making a Discovery.
At the close of the preceding chap
ter I spoke of a young girl who was
preparing for grand opera and who
held hopes for a career. She sang
for me one afternoon and, as I
briefly stated, shocked me by her lack
of voice and other operatic requi
sites This girl was about twenty-two,
and she had been in New York for
four years. She told me she had spent
nearly- five thousand dollars on her
musical education,, so I was prepared
to be impressed.
But when I heard that piping voice
my heart sank. I hardly dared
breathe. When she finished . I had
to turn my head away so she couldn't
see my eyes.
'"Well?" she asked, in a significant
tone.
. ,1 was aware she expected me to
enthuse, but I couldn't. She had
nothing to Justify studying singing
with expectations of earning money
by it. Just a small, pretty voice.
For opera she would have required
several times as much as she had
In order to have been heard in an
auditorium. She wasn't particularly
- musical, either, and had no more
temperament than a piece of wood.
I doubt, also, if she Mad the physical
strength Which one must . have in
opera.
She stood there waiting for me to
speak.
"What shall I say?" I asked in
-; a feeble way.
-"Say? What do you mean?"
' I was embarrassed, of course. But
, I finally decided to give my opinion,
truthfully. It-is unkind, I feel, to
delude people by false compliments.
. Itfo one ever can be helped by such
a course. If we are to progress we
, tnust be told of our weaknesses,
otherwise they never can be con-
So I followed what I
thought my better judgment.
Never will I forget the look of
scorn "on that girl's face. She
wouldn't nermit me to finish.
"You don't know, she Interrupted.

"My teacher is an authority, and he ;
tells me ..."
It was a story I afterwards cams j
to know onlv too well. The poor.
misguided and trusting pupil over
and over again. Led on ana on Dy
a teacher who was unworthy to be. '
called a teacher ... for the sake
of getting his fee.
A few weeks later I had another
experience somewhat similar. In this
Instance, however, the singer had so
big and unwieldy a voice that her
difficulty was learning to control it.
Seemingly she was of grand opera
calibre, but her defect was lack cf
endurance. She could sing two or
three songs; never more, I discov
ered this only a short time ago, when
this singer made her opera debut
(after acquiring a splendid vocal
technique) in which she barely lasted
to the end.
This c-iri. however, had brains.
She realized that heV opportunity
lay in concert; ana sne is singing in
that field now, successfully.
It was at this time my own les
sons began, after one of our pe
riodic visits to New 'York.
For the benefit of others I would
like to say. here, how great is the
difficulty of finding the teacher who
has both knowledge and sympathy.
Some instructors do very well with
certain types of young men and
women, but fall completely with dif
ferent ones.
Tt is a safe rule, however, to be
cautious and to look askance at the
teacher who makes reckless predic
tions of what the prospective pupn
may expect to do professionally, in a.
short time.
My own experience is so far out
side the one usuld to singers that it
cannot be taken as coming within
any rule. I am 1 told. I was the ex
ception, which possibly is true. I
do know, from -observation and what
I have been tola by experts who are
honest, that more fine voices are
ruined by the desire to "go quickly"
than in any other way.
Rome wasn't built in a day. and
, a singer is, not. .either. ,

at the state fair Charles F. Willis,
consulting supervisor of the depart
ment of industrial relations of tne
Phelps-Dcdge corporation of Bisbee,

This collection, containing as it
does many- specimens impossible or

very finest collection, of copper ores
extant. It includes many . rare ana
beautiful crystaline. azurites and
malachites which run the gamut of
the color, scale in blues and greens.
These crystals are often cut for beau
tiful jewels. According to Mr. Willis
there are no known deposits at pres
ent of those '. rare mineral exhibits,
except in minor ocojurrences. Of tne
specimens at hand, some of them
measure two and three feet across,
and for beauty surpass anything in
this line ever found.
Willis was former superintendent
of the mineral department at the fair
and Ja very much , interested in see
ing that the complete mineral collec
tion of 1100 specimens which was
moved from the old quarters to the
new mineral building at the fait
grounds shall be properly displayed
and labeled. Since the close of the
last fair he says he has collected 300
additional specimens in order to se
cure for the state a complete refer
ence ' collection. ..." These additional
specimens were sent to the Univer
sity of Arizona and Mr. Willis is now
asking for their return. He was In

Dr. Edwards' Olive Tablets Get
at the Cause and Remove It
Dr. Edwards' Olive Tablets, the sub
stitute for calomel, act gently on the
bowels and positively do the work.
People afflicted with bad breath find
quick relief through Dr. Edwards' Olive
Tablets. The pleasant,. sugar-coated
tablets are taken for bad breath by
all who know them. 1
Dr. Edwards' Olive Tablets act gen
tly but firmly on the bowels and liver,
stimulating- them to natural action,
clearing the blood and gently purifying
the entire system. They do that which
dangerous calomel does without any
of the bad after effects.
All the benefits of nasty, sickening,
griping cathartics are derived from
Dr. Edwards' Olive Tablets without
pipingjiainor any disagreeable effects.
Dr. F. M. Edwards discovered the
formula after seventeen years of prac
tice among patients afflicted with
bowel and liver complaint, "with the
attendant bad breath.
Olive Tablets are purely a vegetable
compound mixed with olive oil; you
will know them by their olive color.
Take one or two every night for a week
and note the effect. 10c and 25
