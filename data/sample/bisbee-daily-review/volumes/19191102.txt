Secretary ' Putnam announces that
the Y. M. C. A. will extend the privi
leges of the association to the drivers
and mechanicians in the El Paso to
Phoenix automobile race, on their ar
rival in Bisbee this afternoon.
Through the courtesy of the local 'Y'

ming pool and fuil privileges will be
extended them, so that they may
clean up and rest up from their first
long grind.
They're off!
At 6 o'clock this morning the great
rat of southwestern sporting events,

time to be taken by the racers In
reaching Bisbee vary by an hour and
a half, it is the belief of the majority
of those who are acquainted with con
ditions between here and El Paso
that the first car will come up the
Naco road at about 2 o'clock. The
first car Into Bisbee in the 1914 race,
which was driven by Hugh Miller,
made the trip from the Texas city in
7 hours and 31 minutes, waich, if ac
complished today, will bring Ihe first
car about 1:30 o'clock in the after
noon. K ,
When the cars reach Bisbee "they
will be checked at the east end of
the E. P. & S. W. depot, when they
will be taken In charge by J. A.
Kempton, chief of police, who will
have complete jurisdiction over them
until they are checked out nmiorror
morning. From the checking station
they will be taken to the central sta
tion, which will extend along the
Thelps Dodge store and warenouse.
There they will be kept in a roped-in
enclosure, while six guards, working
iu two shifts of three men each, will
watch them until they are checked
out in the morning. The chief had a
gang of men busy stringing wires for
t-Uctric lights' along the side of the
building yesterday afternoon.
The first car will leave. Bisbee at
6:30 o'clock tomorrow morning, and
the others will follow at five-mmute
intervals. From here to Tombstone it
in expected that the racers win aver
age a mile a minute. All traffic com
ing into Bisbee along the Tombstone
canyon roac! is warned to arrange its
schedules that it may get into this
city before 6:30 o'clock, as the road
will be cleared at that time and kept
free from vehicles until the last car
has left It is expected that at least
30 of the cars will arrive'here.

be shunted into the valley road this
morning, and all persons are asked
10 avoid using the Bisbee, Lowell,

brought at the instance of Col. Chas.
W. Harris, "to determine which is
the adjutant general of Arizona,"
was ordered here today by Superior
Judge Stanford. He made the order
on the motion of Will Ryan attorney
for Captain Ingalls.
Ryan based his motion on the fact
that the combination of the safe con
taining records of the adjutant gen
eral's office was in the possession of
Colonel Harris and that Captain In
galls has been refused it. Ryan con
tended the safe might contain evi

Given More Time on Treaty
PARIS, Nov. 1. The supreme coun
cil of the peace conference held a
long discussion today, of the' date for
the formal ratification of the German
peace treaty. No positive decision
was reached, but it is said to be un
likely that the date would be earlier
than November 20.
PARIS, Nov. 1. (By The Associ
ated Press.) Demand will be made
of Germany that all violations of the
armistice shall be made good. This
has been' decided upon by ( the
supreme council which has completed
the protocol to the German treaty.
The protocol provides that Ger
many shall surrender cruisers and de
stroyers to replace those sunk at
Scapa Flow, and also surrender float
ing dry docks, lighters, cranes, tugs,
and other naval equipment equal in
value to that of the firBt class battle
ships destroyed, which Germany can
not replace
There is no provision in the proto
col as to how the warships and naval
supplies shall be divided among the
allied and associated powers. Ger
many has been asked to send a com
mission to Paris to sign the protocol
and attend the formal ratification of
the treaty.
The supreme council has completed
its reply to the Bulgarian request for
cl anges in the peace treaty, and will
probably submit it to the Bulgarian
representatives tomorrow, granting
ten days for the signature. '
BULGARIA'S TIME EXTENDED
PARIS, Nov. 1. Bulgaria has been
granted the delay asked for before
making her decision on the peace
treaty. The supreme council today
gav e itsconsent to her request for ad
ditional time, made by the Bulgarian
delegation.
The supreme council today consid
ered the reply which Is being framed
to Bulgaria's objections to certain
clauses of the treaty submitted to her
plenipotentiaries.
According to the Temps, the council
likewise considered the terms ot a
note which soon will be sent to the
Jugo-Slav . and Rumanian govern
ments, 1 setting forth the status of
those governments with regard to the
Bulgarian treaty, and informing them
that it does not seem possible to al
low them to sign the treaty so long
as they have not given their assent
to the treaty with Austria.
With regard to the (rate ror putting
the German treaty into effect, the
newspaper says it appears now that
it will be an impossibility to arrange
for that function to take place No

CHICAGO, Nov. 1. Although to
night found nearly all the nation's
vast bituminous coal fields closed as
a result of the miners' strike, effec
tive Friday midnight, thousands of
non-union miners were at work, and
ir. scattered districts where contracts
still were in force, union miners re
ported today as usual. Figures com
piled tonight and based chiefly upon
union leaders' claims, although in
many cases conceded by the opera
tors, showed that 435,820 men were
on strike.
Stops Soft Coal Production
In its physical aspects, the strike
apparently had largely stopped pro
duction of soft coal, but with large
non-union fields in Pennsylvania and
Kentucky in particular, still operat
ing at somewhat near normal, and
with a number of smaller fields also
operating with union contract miners,
the actual affect upon production
could not be definitely stated.
The first day of the strike was All
Saints day, also Saturday, a virtual
holiday in many mining regions, and
the full power of the United Mine
Workers of America, which ordered
the strike, will not be fully gauged
until Monday.
Coal operators claimed thousands
of non-union miners were producing
coal in the usual quantities, although

I N LEG ON BEGINS THIRD
ROLL GALL CAMPAIGN IN BISBEE
TODAY FOR NATIONAL RED CROSS
With a complete organization form
ed for every section of the Warren
district, the L. A. Engle, Jr., post of
the American Legion, under the di
rection of Commander Dan Angius,
will begin this morning a member
ship drive for the American Red
Cross. The drive will continue until
Armistice Day, November 11, when it
is hoped that 10,000 members at $1
each will have been added to the rolls
of the local chapter.
The Third Red Cross Roll Call, as
this campaign- will be known, has
been placed under1 the direction of
the American Legion because, as was
pointed out yesterday, no" set of men
Is so fitted and' so eager to conduct
the' drive, as the ex-soldiers and the
ex-bailors 'who have learned by actual
experience . the worth, of the Red
Cross. Magnificent as the work of
the organization has been in every
land and under every condition of
difliculty and peril, it was not until
its sympathies were enlisted by the
greatest war of history that it was
service and to achieve the results
which proved it to be the greatest
"humanitarian institution ever con
ceived by human brain or made a liv
ing thing by human abilify. And it is
a striking thing that the American
lied Cross, the greatest organization
of its kind in the world, should have
achieved its greatest success in car
ing for the American soldier, the
sturdiest, keenest and bravest fight
ing man to be developed In modern
times.
It is because of these facts, as out
lined by Dan Angius, chairman of the
campaign, that the local post of the
American Legion has taken hold of
the drive with enthusiasm. Sub-committees
have been selected for the
various parts of the district, as well
as for the different mines, while an
intensive drive is to be conducted in
Bisbee itseir. Ira B. Joralemon, the
newly elected chairman of the Bisbee
chapter of the American Red Cross,
will cooperate to the greatest extent
with Chairman Angius, and the head
quarters of the Red Cross here are to

The most unusual situation was
that in Utah, where tae majdrrry of
the mines were reported still at work
today. That condition resulted from
conflicting instructions to the miners.
John H. McLennan, Utah representa
tive of the union, called off the strike
4S hours ago, at the same time an
nouncing that he had received a tele
gram from John L. Lewis, head of the
organization, that the strike was off.
That was repudiated today -hy Mr.
Lewis. Then Mr. McLennan rescind
ed his order. Many miners were evi
dently confused, and reports today
said that the miners in that state gen
erally were at work. Reports were
to the effect, however, toat about
1,000 were on strike.

COCONINO CITIZENS WANT
CANYON SUPERINTENDENT OUT
FLAGSTAFF, Nov. 1. Immediate
withdrawal of the young man named
Peters as superintendent ' of the
Grand Canyon national park, is de
manded by citizens of Coconino coun
ty, irrespective of political party, as
a result of the tactics pursued by
Peters during the visit of the king
and queen of Belgium to the canyon.
Who Is responsible for Peters' ap
pointment we do not know, but we
do know one thing, they made a bad
mistake, and one tliat should be
remedied at once, if there is to be
co-operation between the Grand Can
yon National park, and county, city
and state officials.
At the Grant Canyon, state, coun
ty and city officials who were on
the reception .committee named to
receive the king and his party, were
given no consideration whatsoever.
Peters took it onto his shoulders to
"run things" and that he . did so is
iretty well conceded by everybody
who visited the canyon.
When the king's train pulled in
and the committee of 'fcfficrals and

COMMUNITY PROGRAM.
Much time is being devoted to the
development of a speical community
program consisting of the twenty va
riety scheme to be given in the gym
nasium of the Y. M. C. A. on Satur
day evening, November 22. This
event of surprising features is being
supervised by S. A. Worcester, with
whom there will be associated the
social work committee under the
chairmanship of H. E. Ross, coordi
nator of the opportunity school of
the public scrfools of Bisbee. No ef
fort is being spared to make this
program the par excellent one of the
season, and th eway the fellows are
digging in to attain proficiency in
the various events augers well for
the highest possible success of this
entertainment. The minstrel feature
alone will be worth miles going to
see and in value worth ten times the
price of admission to see the whole
entertainment. Admission fee will
be 25 cents. The proceeds goes to
the development of other, community
programs throughout the season. The
faithful efforts of those ' in charge
of this entertainment we believe will
be heartily supported by the entire
community. Tickets are on sale and
can be procured of the following per
sons: Alonzo Crittenden H. J. Paul,
C. F. Butler, Murray Davidson, II. E.
Uoss. Mesdames Hatter, Lytle, Osier,
Joint, Cummings, Misses Gregovich

This is William O. Jenkins, American consular agent kidnaped at

ment insisted that Mexico use all the forces at its command to obtain

paid. He lias now been released for the second time.
Postoffice Girls
Entertain Friends
About 80 of the younger set of
Bisbee and Douglas were entertained
by the girls of the local postoffice
on Friday evening at a charmingly
appointed Hallowe'en party given at
the Woman's club.
Ghosts and cats were mingled with
orange and black crepe td attain a
stunning effect in the decorations.
The music- for the affair was fur
nished by Becker's orchestra.
A feature of the evening's enter
tainment was the fortune-telling of
Madame Cananea, who displayed a
startling, if sometimes humorous
knowledge. of the past and the fu
ture. Cheese dreams and coffee were
served at the close of the evening
and the party ended with a general
verdict that the postoffice girls
proved themselves to be exceptional
hostesses.

my health was awful.
My mother bought me a bottle of
Cardui, and I began to improve after
taking the first bottle, so I kept it up
till I took three ... I gained, and
was well and strong, and I owe it all
to Cardul.
"I am married now and have three
children . . . Have never had to
have a doctor for female trouble, and
just resort to Cardui If I need a tonic.
I am glad to testify to what It has done
for me, so as to help others."

Had they not kept their blood rich in

of Bellevue Hospital (Outdoor liept.), Ntw

are fagged out by worry, work and other
strains might readily build up their strength,

supply of iron in their blood.
As ati example of the superb physical
condition that may be obtained by a mrn of

and who keeps his blood filled with strength

Jack Dempsey, who used Nuxated Iron as a
part of the training which gave him such
marvelous development that he is now recog

liaps the superior of any famous athlete of
ancient times. In connection with his use of
Nuxated Iron, Dempsey says: "Xuxated

What is declared to be perhaps the
iroadost fcitsantee over offerel in the
history of the automobile tire is that
lately announced by the Gates Rub
ber company of Denver. The Gates
Half-Sole tire is guaranteed to wear
5000 miles without a puncture. Jf the
tire should fail to deliver the guaran
teed mileage because of any defect in
workmanship or materials an adjust
ment will be made on a mileage basis.
The guarantee does not apply to the
worn casing over which the Half
Sole i3 mounted. If, for any reason,
the casing does not stand up the Gates
Half-Sole will be removed and reap
plied to another casing to be furnish
ed by the customer.
In commenting upon the guarantee,
J. W. Hendry of the Lowell Ali.ior
company, said yesterday:
"Increase the guarantee on Gates
Half-Sole Tires from 3500 to 5000
miles. Price will remain the same and
puncture proof feature will still stand
gxd. ,
"When Mr. Gates announced this
extremely broad selling policy at a
special conference held Wednesday,
October 8, he made It possible to offer
the motorist tire economy heretofore
undreamed of.
"Surely this is a proposition that
every car owner will be keenly inter
ested in, especially since he is look
ing for a means of avoiding the pur
chase of expensive tires this fall. v-
"The unusual performance of Gates
Half-Sole Tires on the cars of over
1,000,000 motorists warrants us in
making this lemarkable guarantee."

Persons using oversize' tires on
their cars must be careful to see that
their speedometer is adjusted for the
tires they are using or they will find
themselves in trouble with the speed
cops, according to Ed Simmons, man
ager Cochise Motor Co.., who is the
local dealer in Fisk tires.
Asked the cause of this he explain
ed: "Oversize tires are those built In
larger sizes for standard size rims.
It has been the practice of many auto
mobile companies to equip .their cars
was as small a tire as. possible to re
dnce the original cost. Frequently car
owners find that the original tire
equipment of their car does not re
turn anything like the mileage they
expect. This Is a result of under' siz
ing the tires. Many cars using a 32x
3 tire are examples of this.
"Although the fault lay at the door
of the car builder the; trouble was al
ways blamed to the tire manufac
turer. As the result, overside tires
came Into existence and are today In
very general use. Many 32x3 rims
are-equipped with 53x4 tires. This
gives a greater capacity to the tire
and greater rim diameter. And this
greater rim diameter is the thing that
leads to trouble with motor cops." Mr.
Simmons states. "The motorist fre
cuently finds that he will be accused
of driving 35 miles an hour while his
speedometer is tested. The car driver
hns forgotten the diameter of his
wheel is greater bv several inches
with the oversize tire, and for every
revolution his car travels much fur
ther. He will do well to have the
rnedometer on his car adiustert bpfnre
his next trip for there will be little
Vconomv in his tire bills if he must
heln sunnort the anti-sneedr courts.
"Tt should also be, borne In mind

a prominent mining engineer is
now making a thorough examination
of the Bleeson and Jaeger proper
ties of the Shannon Copper com
pany. He is expected to complete
his examination and submit his re
port to the Shannon management in
from two to three weeks.
It depends to a considerable1 ex
tent on the report ot this engineer
as to the future of Shannon. Presi
dent Amster has already stated that
' the Gleeson mine could be sold to
day for between $600,000 andi $800,
000. It cost the company $80,000 in
"1903.
i The Gleeson mine' has a large
tonnage of ore developed, with suf
ficient machinery to carry along the
work there. The ore from this mine
is valuable, for fluxing purposes.
The engineer's examination now un
der way is to determine if this mine
can be worked In conjunction with
the Jaeger property. If the Gleeson
i mine proves cf too low grade it
may be sold.
President Amster is of the opinion
j that if the Gleeson property had a
, smelter it could produce copper to
day at a profit.
The company has no exact data
as to the value of the Jaeger prop
erty. , While some rich ore has been
uncovered it is not enough to form
any conclusion as to the value of
the mine. The engineer's report Is
expected to clear this matter up to

FOR WORTH, Tex., Nov. 1. Oil
men In this section predict that the
price reduction on Burkburnett crude
from $2.25 to $2.00 per barrel will
not remain In effect for many days.
It is claimed that the reduction Is a
direct result of overproduction and
lack of pipe lines and railroad trans
portation. That- the transportation promises
to improve materially within two or
three weeks is indicated by pipe line
developments from the field to re
fining centers. The Texas-Enipire
company's eight-inch line from Burk
burnett to Waurika, Okla., has been
built across .Red River and will be
ready to deliver oil to tank cars
within a week. This line will be
continued to Healdton.
The Gulf Pipe Line company's six
Inch line has been laid about 75
miles out of Burkburnett toward Fort
Worth and will be ready by Decem
ber 1st, to serve the small operators.
The Sinclair eight-inch line from
Burkburnett to Healdton is down for
a distance exceeding 50 miles, and
Woodburn Oil Corporation four-inch
line from Burkburnett to Devol, Okla
home, will be ready for business in
less than ten days.
Other than the pipe line relief
promised, the railroads are making
a desperate ffort to clear, up freight
congestion in the oil fields in order
that tank car service may be im
proved. In the meantime numerous
wells are being held on the sand
waiting transportation outlet.
There are 30 varieties of water
lily. .!
Steadily, continuously and as good
as modem machinery and expert
workmen can build them, they are
coming out of the Oakland factories
the second hundred thousand Oakland
Sensible Sixes to be dedicated to the
efficient and economical service of
discriminating automobile buyers.
These are the cars which are hand
led for ttiis district by the F. J. Keogh
and company Garage, in Lowell.
They are being mac.nnett and as
sembled with greater competence and
'.skill than were the first one hundred
thousand. For experience is a master
teacher.
They are destined to furnish, depen
dable transportation at an unusually
low cost and to perpetuate the rec-
1 ord of : the first hundred thousand,
j which In the continued and varied
: service of their enthusiastic owners
i have proved both their ability and
their thrift.
When first introduced four years
ago, the Oakland Sensible Six was the
pioneer of scientific lightweight con
j struction. Today, with more than
i 100,000 Sensible Sixes in use, the Oak
lland is the leading exponent of the
field that it so successfully pioneered.
The merits of the Oakland Sensible
Six, the practicability of its light
weight construction, have been con
clusively demonstrated through con
slant and arduous use.
! Economy is a paramount Oakland
Sensible Six feature. Owners regu
larly report returns of from 18 to 25
miles from the gallon of gasoline, and
1 from 8,000 to 12,000 miles on tires,
i Combined with this economy is the
efficiency of the famous ' overhead
valve Oakland engine, developing 44
full horsepower an efficiency which
completes the comfort, reliability and
"value of the car.
In addition to the Four Door Sedan,
the Oakland Sensible Six is built in
three other body types the commo-
jdious five-passenger, touring car ,the
active three-passenger roadster ,and

there is no reason, it is thought,
why, Ajo should not have a refinery
on the ground to continue to ship
the refined products as before.
Bythe time the leaching plant has
treated all of the carbonate ores an
other 5,000 ton unit will have been
added to the flotation plant, which
will thenceforth treat 10,000- tons
per day. In other words, from' the
time the first unit of the flotation
plant is in opcratioi,. New Cornelia
will begin treating 10.000 tons of
ore every day and continue at this
rate, at least, for many years.

however, that lie Is working on the

Education is the key to successj
Without education, no man or woman
can reach the top of the ladder.
Books form the groundwork of one's
education. Without welldirected,
diligent reading few persons can
hope to become really educated or
cultured. Self education can become
one of the pleasantest habits and cer
tainly it is of all habits the most
profitable. Education knowledge
means power. It generates ability,
and ability means advancement. Rec
ords inform us that half of our most
successful men never received a
college education and that many of
them never completed even the com
mon school course. '
Edison, Eastman, Frick, Shedd,
Farrell, Wilson, Simmons, Carnegie,
Ford, Duke, ' Douglas these, and
many others who have risen from
the ranks received a very moderate
amount of school education. But
most of them have become educated
men men of knowledge, men of pow
erful mentality,. 'men of keenest ob
servation, men1 of the soundest judg
ment, men who have studied nature
as well as business. Andrew Car
negii had a tutor even after he
graduated to a 't Fifth avenue man

captain? of industry find time to readi
By becoming better educated than
the average and by keeping your
mind on helpful subjects you will
not only qualify for higher financial
rewards for positions of wider re
sponsibility and influence and power

WHAT MAKES AN IDEAL HUSBAND?
"TENDERNESS," SAYS HELEN WORTHING
WHAT KIND OF MEN MAKE
THE BEST HUSBANDS?
What do YOU think?
The Daily Review has asked a
number of charming women to
name the points they think an
ideal husband should possess. To
day Miss Helen Worthing, starring
at the new Capitol Theatre, New
York, gives her answer.
What do YOU think? What Is
the most important characteris
tic a husband should possess?
Write your opinion in 200 words
and mail it to the Woman's Page
Editor. The best opinions will be
published. Miss Doris Kenyon,
star of "The Girl In the Limou
sine," will give her answer tomorrow.
BY HELEN WORTHING.
The one quality in the loye of a
man for a woman that the wife most
appreciates in her husband is a deep
domantic tenderness. The rock on
which most marriages split is the
failure' of the husband to continue
to be the loverv Men have been
trained to think -of themselves . as
masculine' as gruff, aggressive,
warlike, competitive beings whose
duty is primarily to go out into the
world ' and fight for a living for
themselves, and Incidentally, for wife
and children.
In the early years of adult man
hood, men so far forgot this as to
bent to the tenderer urgings of their
natures.
Lovers are not ashamed t admit
that tenderness and sweetness are
an essential part of their natures.
But after marriage, the tendency of
the average man is to forget that he
is his wire's lover and regard him
self nurely as the head of his house
and the provider of his family. He
loves his wife yea but he Is more
or less furtive aboiit it and ashamed
to admit that he was "foolish"
enough to make love to her.
But a woman never, forgets the
days of her courtship and she yearns
often in silence for her husband to
be more the lover of her youth.
The man who has cour age enough
to remain a lover to his wife is the
shining exception. I think that
tenderness is the one most essential
characteristic in a husband.

nun to have a chance to picture the
Ideal Wife
First: The Ideal Hutband must b.
truthful and faithful. This is what a
woman most craves in her man. Every
womai:- likes to thiiik of her husband
as Her Man, the sense of personal
possesion is a far greater satisfaction
to the female heart than men ever

a little daily affection and tenderness
is very dear to a woman's heart, so
this is the next step in the foundation
of happiness in the home. The lovable
woman car. always be trusted, but
woe to the man that deceives her!
That reminds me of a conversation I
had many years ago. with a woman
70 yefrs of age, who had had four hus
bands. At that time, she was having
troubles with Husband No. 4, aged
60, a3 he had the habit of slipping
eway Irom home, giving great anxie
ty to this, husband-loving, faithful old
girl, which necessitated her going
alone, on stormy nights, in her boat,
scouring the island resorts, trying to
locate her man, whom she generally
found sleer-ing comfortably in what
will be known in years to come, as the
prehistoric days, when they had
plzrcB called saloons! In a Heart to
heart talk with this plucky o;d dame
on the subjtct of ideal husbands, she
confided to mo that she liked her first
husband beft. because he never failed
to kiss her when he left the house.
That remark made a lire-long impres
sion on me. Since then In my obser

where this mark of affection was

With no desire to intrude on the

point of disorder to ask: how much
longer is this infernal "Ideal Hus

to give general satisfaction around
the house just as I m, and my home

ries started, however, rny wife eagerly
seizes the Review each morning,
opens it first to" that diabolical series,
and soon I notice her appraising me
over the coffee with a cold ana disap

st of "suggestions" Zor me to follow
in. order. to become ideal. One last
prayer: please don't sr-HS any article
advocating that the Ideal Husband
should not smoke in the house. ' m

would be t!ie last straw.

IDEAL HUSBAND SHOULD
NOT BE TOO IDEAL
Dear Editor: Bisbee. Nov. 1.,
Your series puts me in mind of a
line from that keen observer of hu
man nature,' Pliny the Younger: "His
unly fault was that he had no faults."
My ideal, husband would be. one who
was not too ideal one who had u
fault or two; not' serious-faults, of
course, but "just a few little discrep
ancies to show that lie was human.
I uo not believe any woman iikes tho
p:ilk-and-water husband any more
than she likes the husband who has
such exacting standards-of rectitude
that ho will olten make her miserable
ia trying to enforce thein. ..The. fault
less husband is generally a iaiili-find-inj,
h isband. The human race in the
aggregate is far from perfect; lots not
try to force upon the busy home-pro-,
viding modern husbana, with his com-I'k-x
worries nnd cares, too arbitrary
.1 standard of perfection. Let's have
l:im with his little weaknesses which
we can condone and sympathize over
and let's make it our mission to com
fort and sustain him, and cheer his
business cares away when he comes
home from the day's work. And let's
let him have his little outinss with
'the boys." Sincerely.

iETTERING HEALTH OF GHILDHE
Parents Urged to Take Heed of Number of Defectives in
Schools; Only 35 Per Cent of Children in Central and
Lowell Schools Normal; Condition Not Peculiar
to This District; Local Schools Take Lead
(The Review has arranged to pub
lish a series of articles by Dr. Dur
fee for the parents and children of
the Warren district, on various de
fects found in school children de
fects 'of nutrition, teeth, eyes,
throat, breathing, ears, skin their
causes, and the measures to be tak
en for their prevention or elimina
tion. The first of these articles, on
defects of nutrition, will appear in
an early issue of the Review next
week. Editor).
Determined that the standai J of
health maintained among the school
children of the Warren District , shall
be second to none. in the country,
the ; local school authorities have
launched, through Dr. R. B. Durfee,
school physician, an aggressive and
comprehensive campaign for the
teaching of hygiene, and stimulating
of interest in the subject, to every
child under their care.
Physical examinations -began two
weeks ago have revealed some as
tonishing, but by no means unusual,
conditions of health among the local
school children. The large percent
age . of defective children found does
not indicate a condition peculiar to
the Warren District, but a condition
to which the . school authorities of
this district are brave enough and
progressive ' enough to call attention
with a view to correction.
In' furtherance of this campaign of
hygienic education end correction,
the school authorities are anxious to
have the fullest co-operation of the
parents, both in correcting defects
at home, and in urging upon their
children the necessity of school at
tendance and attention to the school
hygienic program.
"We are trying to make our
schools the best in the country
from the standpoint of the health
and general physical condition of
the children,"., says Dr. Durfee. "Not
as good aa the average school, but
better. The conditions physical ex
aminations of school children in the
Central and Lowell schools have re
vealed are not peculiar to the War
ren District." They are quite gen
eral. But the Warren District
schools wish tc take the lead in
making these conditions known, and
in taking active steps to correct
them."
Negligence on the matter of health
in other schools. It is pointed out,
often serves to keep the parents in
ignorance of their children's physical
defects and what is necessary to
correct them, to the serious detri
ment of the - children in mature age.
The Warren District school authori
ties have decided to commit no sin
of omission in the matter, but to
give health conditions the widest
possible publicity.
"Parents must not be alarmed un
duly over the percentage of defec
tive children found in the schools,"
says Dr. Durfee, "nor entertain any
idea that these defects are contagi
ous. They should send their chil
dren to e;1ioo1 to get the benefit,
among the many other school bene
fits, of a training in hygiene, and
of the physical examinations through
which these defects are made known
and corrected. It is the hope of the
school authorities that the parents
will co-operate with them in every
possible way ' in the health work
which has been' undertaken."
Last week the Review published
the results of Dr. Durfee's examina
tion of 402 white school children
examined in the Central school. Of
these 275, or 88 per cent were .found
Of 763 white children so far
given physical examinations in
the Lowell and Central schools,
488, or more thr.n 65 per cent,
have been found defective.
The percentage of defective
American children in the schools
is higher than the percentage of
defective Mexican children.
Of the hundreds of men turned
down in this district during the
army draft, 85 to 90 per cent
were rejected because of physical
defects which could easily have
btfen corrected in childhood.
This condition is not peculiar to
the Warren District, but is wide
spread throughout the schools of
the country, Th Warren Dis
trict school authorities have pro
gressively decided to set the ex
ample, and have launched a vig
orous campaign to make the dis
trict lead in the standard of health
among its children.
The school authorities of this
district are taking the lead in
making the health of the children
a paramount and scientifically ad
ministered issue in the school cur
riculm. They need the co-operation
of every father or mother
who has a child in school. All
parents should read the accom
panying article carefully.
defective, and of these latter 138
cases were classified as defects of
nutrition. This week physical ex
aminations were conducted in the
Lowell school, and resulted as fol
lows: Total number white chil
dren examined 361
Total number normal 148 or 40
Total number defective 213 or 5
Defects of nutrition 109 or 30
Defects of teeth .".142 or 397c
Defects of eyes 29 or 89c
Defects of throat 8 or 2
Defects of breathing . 28' or 7
Defects of ears r 4 or, 1
Defects of skin .'. "f'or 2
From these figures it will be seen
that the condition discovered in the
Central sehool is but little better in
the Lowell school. An interesting
comparison is that ' in the Central
school, while 34 per, cent of the 402
Anglican children examined were
found to have defects of nutrition,
only 2S per cent of the Mexican chil
dren in the school had defects of
nutrition. In the Lowell school the
percentage was 30 per cent for white
children and only 18 per cent for
Mexican. This is attributted not to
poorer -feeding of American children
than Mexican, but to the operation
of the law of the survival of the
fittest among the Mexicans,' with
whom those unfitted for existence
have now mostly , succumbed, while
with the American the weak units
have survived through better facili
ties for offsetting their handicaps.
Next week the Warren school
children will be examined, and the
work will be continued until every
school child in the district has been
given a physical examination.
Heretofore it has been the custom
in the Warren District schools, as in
most other schools in populous
centers, to examine the children and
make certain recommendations as to
their general condition, but the local
school authorities have decided that
this is not enough. ,
"We are . now ,. going after the
health betterment of the children on
a wholesale scale," says Dr. Durfee,
"in an effort to stir up a keen,
working interest in the subject on

THE NEWSPAPER AND THE COMMUNITY
IT IS the mission of the newpapet to serve the needs of all
within the community in which it circulates. Similarly, in
order that it' may serve well, it is the .mission of the com
munity to serve the newspaper with its patronage, with appro
bation; of the newspaper's aims, and constructive criticism on the
way in' which the newspaper sets about to . fulfill these aims The
interdependence of the community and its newspaper is one of
mutual benefit.
The newspaper, like most of life's essentials, is so much a
matter-of-fact daily occurrence that the tendency of the average
reader is too often to take it for granted as an item of routine,
like eating one's breakfast, or- going through the morning's mail.
The newspaper in its wider and more beneficial relations, to the
community is seldom though of. '
The newspaper is in manyrespccis the mirror of the com
munity . the reflection of its culture and erudition, its business
and civic life, its social and physical advantages in fact, all the
characteristics by which it may be judged by the outsider. And
the newspaper gives the community what the community puts into
it, with always a little, and often a great deal, more.
In 90 cases out of 100 the outsider, particularly the home
seeker, forms his opinion as to the desirability of any certain city
or community us a dwelling place, from that city's newspaper. The
newspaper's value, is thus threefold it keeps the finger of the
reader on the pulse of the world and abreast of hisN own civic life
by furnishing him the foreign, national and local news; its adver
tising columns serve as a valuable medium for informing his
neighbors of his wants, or what he has to exchange in merchan
dise, property or talent, thus facilitating social and commercial re
lations and stimulating progress within the community; and lastly,
it occupies the wider field of advertising the community abroad, and
holding up the mirror of the community's culture and progressive
ness to the world at large.
Readers appreciate the news given them by their local paper;
they appreciate its value as a local advertising medium. It is the
newspaper's broader meed of service as nn expression of them
stives to tne world outside that llie.v r.re prone to overlook.
Subscribers to the Review in Eastern cities show this paper to
their friends, and attention is attracted to the Warren District. The
Review is found in chamber of commerce offices and libraries
throughout the southwest, where home-seekers come for informa
tion. From its columns are formed the outsider's opinions as to
Bisbee's social, civic and economic life.
The newspaper thus serves the community both within and
without. That it may serve well without, and be a. credit to" the
community which it represents, it is the duty of the newspaper to
make itself . as attractive as possible. Making a newspaper attrac
tive costs money, which can come to the newspaper only through
subscriptions, patronage of its advertising columns and its com
mercial printing department. The newspaper, unless it be operated
at a loss, can give the community but a limited margin more than
the community puts into it. The dependence is mutual; the debt
is on neither side. .
JOHN BARLEYCORN, PRIVELEGED OUTLAW
THERE is ffod for thought in the , appeal just issued by Com
missioner Roper, head of the bureau of internal revenue, to
'law-abiding citizens, churches, civic organizations and welfare
societies" to aid in the "enforcing of the prohibition enforce
ment law." ,
The citizens of the United States, through their representatives
in state legislatures have in no uncertain terms condemned that
frayed and frowsy social outlaw, John Barleycorn. The congress
of the United Slates has not only passed a law for the enforce
ment of the people's expressed wish in the matter, but only a few
days ago repassed the law over the veto of President Wilson. Now
Commissioner RopCr is obliged to call upon unofficial organizations
of citizens to prevent, as he puts it, "bringing into disrepute the
American form 01 government."
The implication is obvious either the American citizen wants
his prohibition with a string attached wants it for the other fel
low, but not for himself or the expressed will of the great ma
jority of the American people i3 being flouted and held in con
tempt by an inconsiderate minority, and the foundation of major
ity rule upon which the entire American government rests is being
openly challenged and defied.
That the national prohibition law is being flouted, and flouted
in all parts of the country, no one who has at all observed the
situation in the last few months will deny. In almost any city, of
size in these United States anyone who "has the price" can get not
only liquor, but whiskey, brandy, or any other variety oft- he high
powered brand. In some cities, it is said, whiskey is being sold
openly to total strangers over saloon bars. The only difference is
in price. What prohibiting prohibition has done has been solely a
matter of pocketbook prohibition.
In established "dry" territory of some years standing, such as
the state of Arizona, flouting of the state prohibition! laws is as
old as the laws themselves, and still flourishing. The coming of
national prohibition has had no appreciable effects on the now
'ancient and honorable" profession of bootlegging. It is taken as a
matter of course in this state, and inesumably in all other dry
states, that '"anyone who has the price can get it." Here again,
the steadily mounting price or "the stuff" has been largely the
measure of its proamnion. In one Arizona city the price of alleged
whiskey recently dropped i'i a pint, because of the inroads made
on its traffic by the growing popularity of "white mule!"
Commissioner Roper is right in his appeal the wrong of it
lies in such an appeal being necessary. It i3 time the prohibition
law was rigidly enforced in spirit by the people themselves. It is
time that not only John Barleycorn, but all the "substitutes" for
him with which some of his former devotees are now voluntarily
depriving themselves of their reason to the detriment of society,
were swept into the discard and kept there.
Unless, of course, the American people wish to insult them
selves by making a mock of their own laws.
This is a free country, and our foreign element is free to think
and live as it pleases as long as it doesn't get too free with the
rough stuff. '
1 This is a free country now. Once let those who demand greater
freedom get their hands on the reins and it will, be free no longer.
P;irenls are showing keen interest in an rloctric spanker which
is being txhibited in New York.

PEPY'S DIARY IN BISBEE
Nov. 1. To town early, having some business to do, which took but a
short time, and then to the office, feeling'much like working after a long
sleep whei ein I dreamed I was a county supervisor and was directing a dozen
highway commissions at once, which made my wife say that 1 was very
listless. Much talk this day of the dances last night, and I saw the cashier
waltzing with the -assistant, whose little brown slippers shone on the floor,
hey weie so highly polished, and so did her fingers, from getting some of
ihe polish on them, too. To my assistant reporter, who told me a story
bout the women in her house, and of how angry they were with each other.
U'itif they met, when they kissed each other, as women ever do, and forgot
abcut the quarrel until the visit was over, when they began again. To Lowell,
where I saw a stately dame behind a cigar counter, and 1 bought some cigaref
from her, but she awed me so mightily that when I started to smile at her
pimply grinned and slipped out in the street. I think I like them less grand
and more cling.ng. Wore my new overcoat today, which I purchased from
the telcgiaph man, and well pleased with it, although there is a button miss
ing on the sleeve, which 1 must have replaced. To Mr. Murray, with whom
I recited limerick, and he had some of his own composition which, pleased
me mightily, as well as to see a grave and learned lawyer stoop to such l'ght
amusement. Did talk also about free verse, and how I hate Amy Lowell, and
her ode to herself in a bath tub, which truly seems the last theme in the
world for a poet, she weighing so much. Much work today, although the
office is in good shape since Mr. Goodrich came back, and no complaints from
any woman about the diary, which heartened me, although'a woman's murmur

in Paris that night and sang and
marched, but the wild, spontaneous
outburst of joy and enthusiasm
which characterized the signing of
the armistice and the cessation 6f
actual killing was lacking.
The showing which the American
troops made in the allied victory
parade in Paris on Bastile day, July
14 of this year, was a glorious one,
according to Rev. Fry, who was an
eye-witness.
"The sentiment of the French was
naturally in favor of their own na
tive heioes. marching with flags and
regalia denoting the sectors on which
they had defended their country and
its homes against the invader," said
Rev. Fry. "But after this local pa
triotism, the Americans came in for
the greatest applause. It was gen
uine applause, spontaneously called
forth in sheer admiration of the ap
pearance of the American picked
troops. From a military standpoint
their showing was the best in the
parade. They were truly splendid."
The biggest problem confronting
the Y was keeping the men contented
after the armistice was signed, as

the long montns since woveuiuei

mobilized, with a large percentage
of the men necessarily held to per
form the tremendous post-war tasks
confronting the American army.
?The armistice i cnughfr ' American
war activity at high tide" said Rev.
Frv. "The Germans knew this.
which was one good reason why they
were so willing to sign. The amount
of supplies pouring in at the time
of the armistice was enormous.
Cleaning up and straightening things
out after fighting ceased was a task
of almost incredible dimentions.
"Every man in the service of sup
ply wanted to get up to the front
riniinir the actual fighting, but they
all knew they had at big and neces
sarv riutv where they were and stuck
to their posts. When the fighting
ceased, however, and they knew their
last chance for actual combat was
gone, they became restless and
wanted to get back home. They had
stayed back building barracks, dig-p-inc
ditches, handling supplies and
performing other unromantic duties
for many weary months always with
a glimmer of hope that some day
they would get their chance in the
first line trenches. When the armis
tice came this hope was gone. Yet
man yof these unsung heroes were
forced to remain at the central rec
ords headquarters at Itourges until
September 1, or nearly a year after
the war ended, and even then some
of them were sent to Paris for fur
thr service.

stopped, said Rev. Fry. and had the

weeks launched war on a scale mile

The Germans knew this, and sensed

Rev. Fry was one of the first to
heed the call to the service of his
country when the United States en
tered the world conflict in the spring
of 1917. He volunteered for Y. M.
C. A. service, was accepted, and left
his pulpit in Bisbee for the" broader
field of army welfare work. From
Bisbee he went first to Camp Cody,
the huge training camj? at Deming,
New Mexico, where he spent a month
in "Y" work. From there he went
to Fort Bliss, near El Paso, Texas,
where he spent six months in the
service. His opportunity for service
overseas then came, and he arrived
in France in March. 1918, when the
Germans were at the height of their
final, colossal thrust for victory.
In the year and a half of continu
ous work with the army in France,
Rev. Fry was at many important
allied bases over a wide stretch of
territory ; he was in Paris at the
time the mysterous "Big Bertha"
first began shelling the French me
tropolis; he was in Paris at the time
nf ih hisr allied victory parade, and
ha,a iviipn (icrnianv signed the
pea
rinr.la.res Rev. Fry, was the quiet
self-sacrificina heroism and devotion
to duty which characterized the men
in the service of supply.
"These boys were all wild with
impatience to get to the front" said
Rev. Fry. "Their devotion to duty
under the circumstances was heroic.
They had a great and vital task to
perform behind the lines a task as
necessary as that ot the men in the
trenches but a task without the
glamor and dramatic stimulus of
actual battle. They suppressed their
impatience and stuck to their drab
and arduou swork in true soldier
fashion of sacrificing personal incli
nation to the exigencies of duty.
Here and there the bonds of re
straint were burst and some men
-deserted" to the front to get a
hand in the actual fighting. These
would come back and report later,
and we could not blame them much.
In the service of supply the Y. M.

in furnishing amusement to the men

IT'S NEVER YOUR CHURCH
IT'S YOU
If you want to belong to the kind of
a church
That's the kind of a church you
like
Don't go and pack your clothes in a
grip
And start on a long, long hike.
You'll find elsewhere what you left
behind ,
'Cause there's nothing that's really
new; i
It's a knock at yourself when you
knock your church
For it isn't the church its you.
A church is not made by those arraid
Lest someone else gets ahead;
When everyone works and nobody
shirks.
You can raise your church from the
dead.
And if you work Tor the Lord not
nraise.
Your brother will help you, that's
true:
Your church then will be what you
want ito be.
I'nr it's never your church it's
you.

Wants Council Job as
a Matter of Civic
Pride
BY FRED TURBYVILLE
N. E. A. Sports Writer.
CLEVELAND. Nov. 1. One more
fight not more than two and John
ny Kilbane -will retire with the
championship of the featherweight
ranks. N
Kilbane made this announcement
today as he rested between political
speeches. Kilbane is, running for
councilman on the Democratic ticket
in the First Ward.
"But I'm not retiring on account
of politics," said Johnny. "It is be
cause of bad hands and the fact
that there seems to be no oppon
ent worthy of a championship scrap.
(The council job only pays $1000 a
year.)
"My hands are giving me lots of
paiit. They hurt me in every fight.
After my recent bout with Eddie
Morgan I had to stick them in a
bucket' of cracked ice and keep them
there an hour.
"I won't fight again until after
election, Nov. 4. I will box in one
or two more bouts and then I'm go
ing to retire. I have not signed up
for any fights."
And If Kilbane sticks 'to his word
hfi-irW-r likely retire 'wltlTlnVBelC"
for there appears no fighter in the
ranks of the feathers today capable
of giving him any sort of a trial,
lie has whipped all of them and
with ea'se.
He is one of the greatest cham
pions of all time unfortunate only
in the fact that he has so far out
classed hi3 field that interest has
larked because close contests were
never the order.
Kilbane has held the title seven
years. He won it in a 20-round de
cision bout with Abe Attell. He has
stood ahead and shoulders above all
others since then. In 1913 Johnny
Dundee fought a ten-round draw with
him, but he since outclassed Dundee.
In 1917 he was knocked out by
Benny Leonard, a lightweight. It
was the only knockout' he has suc
cumbed to in the 14 years of fight
ing. He has fought 133 bouts. He has
won twenty over the knockout
route. He has far outclassed his op
ponent time after time, but 'did not
use a haymaker on him because of
his bad hands.
Kilbane's hands are very brittle.
He broke the right one on Johnny
Albanese in 1911. The left one
cracked against the chin of Monte
Attell the same year. He won the
title with a pair of hands that great
ly pained him. Bonesetter Reese
could do nothing with them.
And despite thi3 pair of hands
the most brittle, of all ringmen
Johnny Kilbane has never called off
a fight because of them.
"In all my boxing- days I have
cancelled but one bout and that was
because of a sudden attack of acute
Indigestion. I was to Fight Ritchie
Mitchell that time," said the cham
pion. Stung by criticism of sport writ
ers and fans Kilbane . occasionally
would display his knockout punch,
but it eenerally hurt . him worse
than the fellow who was on the re
ceiving end.
Kilbane is one of the most won
derful boxers of modern times. His
defense is almost impregnable. In
14 years of boxing he began at 16
he has few scars His hands are
the worst. They are knotted and
gnarled. His left ear has a very
small cauliflower. It is hardly notice
able. There is a scar above the
right eye, but he got that in a boy
hood accident and not in the ring.
The featherweight champion is
very popular throughout the country
and particularly In Cleveland. He Is
one of the cleanest fighters we've
ever had and a credit7 to the game.
His wife and kiddies often went
with him to other cities where he
was to box. He had them with him
rn the Pacific Coast. He was mar
ried before he won the title.
Friends have tried to coax Johnny

252 for one game has set a mark
which, will not easily be surpassed.
uBt as George Mieyr says, the aver
age bowler is always an optimist, and
each one is hoping that his next
game will be one that will be famous
in the annals of the local alleys.
The C. & A. team established a

There's only one thing that wor

that was the handshake.
"At first they nearly killed me
gripping my hand," said Johnny.
"But I beat 'em to it now. I get
the grip first and then with my
other hand over his I sort of push
back his thumb and he can't squeeze
this old broken fist."

in one of "the hardest ring : battles
ever staged" in southern Arizona, "and
who meets Russell Chambers or
Douglas here on Friday night, will
arrive in Bisbee tomorrow and will
begin immediately to complete his i
training. This information was con
veyed to O. S. French, manager of
the Bisbee Athletic club yesterday in
a letter from Bob Sweeney, Celmars'
manager, who declares that the

match between him and Chambers j
had been arranged, and will be in
first-class shape when he steps into j
the ring. Sweeney will accompany i
his man to Bisbee.
With Kid George actively in train
ing with him Chambers began yes
terday his intensive course of sprouts
for the bout. George has had a world
of experience in handling men and
it is believed that his instructions tu
the Smelter City boy will improve
him greatly during the remainder of
the, training period.
Tickets for the program will be
placed on sale today and may be ob

queror of Al Mauch on Friday night.
Collins is working hard also, and
with Ford's challegence to fight
Collins on a winner-take-all basis,
the fans are due to a real fight ac
cording to predictions made yester
day.
Betting on the main event on Fri
day night has been more brisk and
spirited than in any other fight for
some time according to those who
are watching the wagers. For two
or three days there has been plenty
of Celmars money in sight with more

well as against his "rabbit punch,"
at which be hns shown himself to be
an expert.

COWBOY SPORTS
TO BE FEATURE
OF STATE PI
PHOENIX, Nov. 1. "The cowboy
sports program of the Arizona state
fair will be staged in a more satis
factory manner from the spectator's
standpoint than ever before," is the
prediction made by Jack Barber, who
will have charge of this picturesque
feature depicting life on the Arizona
cattle ranges. In order to avoid any
confusion or danger in the staging
of the bull tieing and calf tieing
contests I.arber has had the entire
inner field of the half-mile track en
closed with a high paige wire fence.
The corrals and chutes have been
placed on the r,de opiosite the grand
stand and when the animals are re
leased they will be roped and tied in
lull view of all grand stand specta
tors. Another advantage of this arrange
ment is that it wiil permit the cow
boy program and the race program
to be carried out simultaneously. The
broncho busting, however, will be
staged on the mile track directly in
front of the grand stand and the re
lay and pony express races will be
carried out on the half-mile track.
Interest among rough riders who
are gathering here from all parts of
the west centers in the championship
events. A purse of $2000 will be split
among the. winners of the bull tieing
contest and another $2000 among the
winners of the calf tieing contest.
One hundred entries are expected in
the latter event, and in the former
fifty teams will be entered. Tryouts
will be put on every afternoon of fair
weeK wnn me exteiuiuu ui otiui
day. Clay cGonnigill, famous rough
rider of El Paso; Lloyd Sanders, not
ed trick rider; Vera McGinnis, rated
as the mbst accomplished woman
trick rider of the world; Skeeter Bill
Robins, note das a bull-dogger; Hen
ry Walters of Cheyenne, who climbs
underneath his mount from one side
to the other while on the dead run,
are some of the stars who will par
ticipate in the rodeo events.
A big bunch of accomplished riders
and ropers are coming down from
Prescotl, Globe. Tucson, Willcox,
Skull Yaliey and other range centers
of the state will be well represented
i nthe contests.

FORT WORTH, Tex., Nov. 1.
With a daily production of 90,000
barrels of oil being taken out and
an estimated production of 100,000
barrels additional for which there Is
no outlet, Burkburnett continues to
be the wonder of the oh corld. For
the past 90 days the production has
been so far in excess of the trans
portation that operations have been
severely. Handicapped. f
' A recent' gaugers list of wells' in
the Northwest Extension of the field
showed wells capable of making 147,
000 barrels daily from which only
60,000 barrels daily can be taken.
The total North Texas .production,
including the extension, the town-
site, Electra, Iowa Park and Petrolia,
has been running right at 100,000
barrels daily, although with sufficient
outlet for the oil that is now avail
able the production would be easily
twice that amount.
680 ILLS IN
THEE FIELDS
FORT WORTH, Tex., Nov. 1.
There was found by careful check
to bo 680 well in Ranger. Desde
mona and Stephens county fields,
producing a total of 139,000 barrels
of oil daily during the first week of
October.
Ranger has 310 wells with a pro
duction of 4,000 barrels; Desdemo
na 175 wells with a total production
of 30,500 .barrels, daily and the vari
ous fields In Stephens county had
195 wells with a delivery,, of 44,500
barrels of oil every 24 hours.
Fifteen new wells were drilled to
the sand during the last 15 days in
September in the Ranger field; 16
in Desdemona and four, in. Stephens
county during the same period. Ran
ger scored only three dry boles, Des
demona seven and Stephens one.
Several wells were drilled in each
field to the sand depth, but were
not brought in because of no trans
portation facilities to remove the
oiL Wet weather also delayed oper
ations in all three fields, particular
ly in Stephens county, where there
are, no railroads and all material is
hauled by trucks and teams. If it
were possible to take all the oil be
ing produced in the three big fields
the ' daily production figures would
be materially increased above 139,000
barrels.

The Red Cross, while fulfilling America's obligation to the stricken peoples of Europe, must
respond to the call at home to meet the greater peace-time responsibilities revealed by the
cessation of war. This means:
AT HOME
I. Organization of the nation's Health forces by co
operation with existing agencies and by independent
action in unorganized communities. Education of house
wives, school children and other groups in food pre
paration, home hygiene and care of the sick.
II. Expansion of Home Service in those communities
where no similar service exists to provide the same help
to civilian families that has been given families of our
fighting men. (In ninety per cent of the Home Service
communities there existed no similar agency,) Provid
ing an Information Service to explain facilities offered
by the government and private sources. Inspiring co
operative effort to make communities safer and better
places in which to live.
III. Emergency relief in epidemics and disaster.
IV. Permanent duty with the Army and Navy.
V. Helping the nation's fighters back to civilian life.
VI. Child welfare work.
VII. First Aid.
IN EUROPE
I. Relieving distress among war sufferers and help
ing their countries recover from the war.
II. Distribution of surplus stores donated by the
American army.
.III. Helping the war orphans in Europe through the
Junior Red Cross.
"The master-problem of civilizatiin is to engage as many people with as much enthusiasm in the upbuilding processes of peace
as, by the traditions of the ages, it has always been possible to enlist in the destructive adventure of war... When people shall
have learned to sacrifice themselves as readily on the altar of the commonwealth as they sacrifice themselves on the altars of
war, the world will be savedand not until then." . . .,
