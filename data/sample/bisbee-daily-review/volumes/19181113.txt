WASHINGTON. Not. 12. Control
of the German fleet by revolutionists,
factions of whom are reported to
have urged resistance to the allies
and United States, may interfere with
the carrying out of the amended armi
stice provision that vessels designated
to be interned be ready to leave Ger
man ports seven days after cessation
of hostilities.
At the end of the 7-day period, which
will expire at midnight next Sunday,
the designated units of the fleet, the
armistice provides" must be complete
ly disarmed. . Prompt action, even
under normal conditions, would be re
quired of the German naval forces to
disarm vessels of the battle cruiser
and battleship type within seven days,
naval experts said. In some quarters
tonight fear w&s expressed that with
the German navy in a disorganized
condition owing to the revolution, the,
necessary preparations for turning'
over the vessels might not be com
pleted in the period specified.
Action to be taken by the allies and
the United States in event the ves
sels were not prepared for surrender
at the expiration of the allowed period
was not indicated tonight by officials.
In such an event only two courses
were regarded as open either exten
sion by agreement of the associated
governments of the time period or
forcible seizure. Should forcible
seizure be necessary it was thought
resistance by the disorganized crews
would be a. hopeless endeavor.
In discussing today the naval terms
of the armistice. Secretary Daniels
said the alied and American navies
were prepared fully to deal with any
situation that might arise. He said
that no intimation of the reported de
fiance from the revolutionists had
come through any naval channel. i
Pending completion of the sur
render of the ships demanded and

while any submarines remain in Ger

there will be no relaxation in the pro

dicated by officials. . It is regarded

East of the Meuse, regardless of the

ANNUAL NEED OF

For Many Years, According
to Present Calculations of

That Sum or More "
(By Review Leaded Wire)
WASHINGTON, Nov.- .-Government
financial needs for many
years are almost certain to run
above $4,000,000,000 annually, treas
ury experts estimate, and most of
the money will be raised by taxa
tion. Consequently students of
government finances think the
taxes imposed last year and paid in
June probably will not be lighten
ed materially by the advent of
peace.
Secretary McAdoo today warned
that taxes necessarily would be high
for many years to pay off war debts,
and that additional government loans
would be required.
Roughly, treasury officials and con
gressional leaders in charge of rev
enue legislation figure this way:
Ordinarily government expenses,
which run around a billion dollars a
year before the war, will now amount
to at least $2,000,000,000 annually for
many years and for two or three years
after the war may be double that fig-

Eighteen of the articles as original
ly prepared by the supreme war coun
cil and as read by President Wilson
to congress were changed under the
limited authority for alteration given
the supreme commander in dealing
with ttc enemy envoys The state
department today received and made
public the amended articles with the
exception that no information had
come as to bciw the changes were
brought about. , Apparently- most of
them were concerted in response to
appeals of the German spokesmen,
though several besides that touching
submarines make the terms more
drastic than before
Instead of 50,000 railroad cars to
be surrendered in evacuated terri
tory, the number is made 150,000. On
the other hand, the number of ma
chine guns to be delivered by the
Germans ii reduced fiora 30,000 to
25,000; the German troops in east

stead of being required to surrender;
provision is made for considering
food needs in Germany in (he taking
of means of transportation, and a spe
cific reference to the regulation of
repatriation of German prisoners of
war at the conclusion of peace is
added.
In response to the German fear of
anarchy in Russian provinces after
evacuation, the time or evacuation is
changed from immediately to "as soon
as the allies, taking into account the
Internal situation of these territories,
shall decide that the time for this has
come." Territories, which belonged to
Austria-Hungary before the war are
added to those which must be evac

an armistice commission to which
Germans will be admitted, to carry
out details under the direction of the
victorious military authorities and in
accord with appended notes, which
were drafted during the conference be
tween Marshal Foch and the German
delegates. The additions and changes

order that the foe may be unable

Although the British, Belgian, French
and American armlet have rested on
their arms, they, nevertheless, are on
the alert for any eventuality and
thus it is purposed they Bhall remain
until the peace which will make the

Germany for an early peace. Starva

many, which once boasted that it
would throw a circle of Iron about
the British isles and starve the people
into submission, today Is begging not
alone for peace, but for bread.
Magnanimity lies in the out
stretched bands of the allies. The
German people are not to be permit

tenance is to be given, but in doing
so undue privations are not to be
visited upon the peoples of the de

Germans have swept. '
In Germany proper . the new gov
ernmental regime apparently is hold

has ended except for a mutiny by the
sailors. It is asserted that the north

ern Germany, are In the hands of
the mutineers, who have called upon
the sailors to defend the country
against the "unheard of presumption"
contained in the allied armistice
terms.
Amendments of the armistice terms
to Germany show that the allies are
more exacting in their demands than
was at first reported. The Teutons
are to be stripped entirely of their
submarines, those wolves of the sea
which have caused such devastation,
instead of 160 as first was stipulated.
A reduction in the quantity of some
of the military equipment to be de
livered up is made, but instead of
50,000 railroad cars, 150,000 must be
surrendered.
The treatise of Bucharest and
Brest-Lltovsk, It is stipulated, must
be renounced and the evacuation of

WASHINGTON. Nov. 12. De
mobilization of men in the military
and naval services of the United
States after their return from
France will be carried out large
ly on a basis of the ability of trades
and occupations to absorb them,
under a plan being worked out by
the labor, war and navy depart
ments and the war industries
board. It vftis said today that the
plan wyi be submitted to President
Wilson soon.
. The war industries board has sent
questionnaires to employers in all in
dustries asking the needs of each for
men and the answers will show where,
when and how rapidly jobs will be
ready for discharged soldiers and sail
ors and what trade are most in need
of them. Supplementing this informa
tion will be that received from draft
boards and community labor boards
which are to co-operate in the work.
The war labor policies board and
the United States employment serv

lab4r department's end. The war de
partment is expected to establish a
new bureau to convert the activities
of Provost Marshal General Crowder's
office to this end. ' General Crowder
was suggested by some officials as the
man best qualified to deal with the
task of preserving the balance of pow

PHOENIX, Art., Nov. 12 To all
united war campaign workers: I
wish to call your earnest attention
to the following telegram just re
ceived from Dr. John R. Moit. di
rector general of the united war
work campaign. This message m
of the most importance to , all
workers in the united campaiga:
"No matter how near or how
distant permanent peace may be
the long period of demobilization
and the period which will precede
demobilization will present great
er need than ever for the service
of the seven co-operating organ
izations and therefore that the re
quested over-subscription of 50
per cent is most necessary."
"Our advisors of the American army
and navy concur in this judgment. I
have conferred on the subject with
the war department and President
Wilson and they strongly emphasize
the need of importance of this work
for the period to follow the cessation
of hostilities. A letter from President
Wilson will appear within two days
expressing his satisfaction that our
plans have been enlarged to render
this great patriotic service. The
months following victorious ending of
war will be accompanied with special
dangers. We need not be solicitious
for our soldiers and sailors when they
are drilling and fighting and confront
ing the great adventure of life and
death but rather when this great ex
citement is withdrawn and discipline
relaxed and hours of leisure multiplied
and temptations are increased. The

with whom we have consulted agree

FOCH AMENDS TERMS.
(By Review Leased Wire)
WASHINGTON, Nov. 12. Amend
ments of the armistice terms made by
Marshal Foch after his first meeting
with the German plenipotentiaries, as
announced tonight by the state de
partment Include the delivery to the
United States and the allies of all
Germany's submarines, instead of 160
specified in the original draft of the
armistice.
Another amendment specifies that
"the countries on the left bank of the
Rhine evacuated by the Germans shall
be administered by the local troops
of occupation," Instead of by the local
authorities under the control of the
armies of occupation.
Instead of the immediate withdraw
al of German troops from Russia, as
originally provided, the amended
terms specify that they shall be with
drawn "as soon as the allies, taking
into consideration the internal situa
tion of these territories (of Russia)
shall decide that the time for this
has come."
Reduction is made in the amount of
certain military equipment to be de
livered by the Germans to the associ
ated governments, including 25,000 In
stead of 30,000 machine guns and 1700
airplanes instead of 2000.
The number of railway cars to be
delivered, however, is increased three
foldfrom 50,000 to 150,000. It Is
against the delivery of this amount of
rolling stock that Dr. Solf, the Ger
man foreign secretary, has protested
to President Wilson, aserting that the
distribution of food in Germany to the
civilian population will be greatly
hampered.
Another amendment provides that
"The allies and the United States
should give consideration to the pro
visioning of Germany during the arm
istice to the 'extent recognized as necessary.
To assure the execution of the arm
istice convention "under the best con
ditions the principle of a permanent
international armistice corn-mission is
admitted." This commission will "act
under the authority of the allied mili
tary and naval commanders In chief."
An amendment to the naval clause
provides that all vessels designated to
be interned shall be ready to leave
German ports within seven days of
the signing of the armistice. Direc
tions for the voyage (to either neutral
ports of those of the allied countries
to be designated) will be given by
wireless.
Other amendments include:
"Renunciation" instead of "aban
donment" of the' treaties of Bucharest
and Brest-Litovsk and on supplemen
tary treaties.
Evacuation by all German fcrces op
erating in East Africa within a period
to be fixed by the allies instead of
within one month.
German troops are required to with
draw immediately from Austria-Hungary
as well as from Roumania and
Turkey.
Evacuation by the enemy of the
Rhinelands (left "and right banks)
shall be so ordered' as to be completed
within thirty-one days in all, after the
signing of the armistice, instead of
nineteen days.

Why Compare Beef and Coal Profits?
Swift & Company has frequently stated that its profit on beef
averages only one-fourth of a cent a pound, and hence has practically
no effect on the price.
Comparison has been made by the Federal Trade Commission of
this profit with the profit on coal, and it has pointed out that anthracite
coal operators are content with a profit of 25 cents a ton, whereas the'
beef profit of one-fourth of a cent a pound means a profit of $5.00 a ton.
The comparison does not point out that anthracite coal at the
seaboard is worth at wholesale about $7.00 a ton, whereas a ton of
beef of fair quality is worth about $400.00 wholesale.
To carry the comparison further, the 25 cent profit on coal is 3V
per cent of the $7.00 value.
The $5.00 profit on beef is only 1 per cent of the $400.00 value.
The profit has little effect on price in either case, but has less effect
on the price of beef than on the price of coal.
Coal may be stored in the open air indefinitely; beef must be kept
in expensive coolers because it is highly perishcble and must be
refrigerated.
Coal is handled by the carload or ton; beef is delivered to retailers by the
pound or hundred weight.
Methods of handling are vastly different. Coal is handled in open cars; bef
must be shipped in refrigerator cars at an even temperature.
Fairness to the public, fairness to Swift & Company, fairness to the packing
industry, demands that these indisputable facts be considered. It is impossible to
disprove Swift & Company's statement, that its profits on beef are so small as to
have practically no effect on prices.

Utterances of Wilhelm As
War Dragged Out Its Course
LONDON. Nov. 12 Prominence is t will creep hito the hones of the enemy.
oK-on Tiv thA HHtish newsDaDers to
some of the utterances made by for
mer Emperor Wiliam while the war
was in progress. In the year 1914 he
said:
Before the leaves fall from the
trees we shall be back again in the
dear fatherland. Exterminate first
the treacherous English and wlk
over General French's contemptible
little army. The warlike spirit still
lives in the German peqple that pow
erful spirit which attacks the enemy
wherever it finds him regardless of
the cost.
"You, my troops, are my guarantee
that I can dictate peace to my ene
mies. Up and at the foes! Gods
goodness will guide the German
people through battle to victory to
the goal appropriated for the German
people by Providence. I have drawn
the sword, which without victory and
without honor I cannot sheathe again.
We stand with our hearts toward God.
To rne dust with all the enemies of
Germany. Amen!"
In the year 1S13 the German ruler
said.
"Our brave soldiers have shown
themselves to be invincible in battle
against nearly the whole world. The
war drama now is coming to its
close."
To the King of Senussi, he said:
"Our common enemies whom Allah
will annihilate to the last man shall
fly before thee. So be it."
Regarding the United States, the
emperor declared:
"America had better look out alter
itiu-hari'Kt has been taken. What
a magnificent success on the road to
victory lias been gained with God s
help!
'Germany is invincible in spite of
the superior numbers of o'ir enemies
and every day confirms this anew.
Germany knows her strength and he
relies on God's help
"The foe is defending his native soil
foot by foot. This is the resistance of
despair, but it must be broken. He
has prepared his soup and now he
must bup it. I look to you to see to it.
"All Germany contemplates with
prido her brave sons whose deeds,
with God's help, will be a landmark
on the road to final victory."
In 1917 the head of the German na
tion said:
"If the enemy does not want peace
then we must bring peace by batter-
inr in with iron ftst ana sninms
sword the doors of those who w ill not
have peace.
"Victory in the coming year will
again be on our side and on that of
our allies. If only we cast the burden
on the Lord, He will smite the foe

prototype of perfidious England.

j Meaning of the Armistice
What doe3 the armistice mean to the
American people, and the people of the
world? This question is one asked fre
quently and can be answered in no better
manner than with the' words of President
Wilson, in his address to congress, Mon
day afternoon, after he had completed the
reading of the terms of the armistice.
The president said:
"The war thus comes to an end; for
having accepted these terms of armistice,
it will be impossible for the German com
mand to renew it.
"It is not possible to assess the conse
quences of this great consummation. We
know only that this tragical war, whose
consuming flames swept from one nation
to another until all the world was on fire,
is at an end and that it was the privilege
of our own people to enter it at its most
critical juncture in such fashion and in
such force as to contribute in a way of
which we are all deeply proud, to the great
result. We know, too, that the object of
the war is attained; the object upon which
all free men had set their hearts; and at
tained with a sweeping completeness which
even now we do not realize. Armed im
perialism such as the men conceived who
were but yesterday the masters of Ger
many is at an end, its illicit ambitions en
gulfed in black disaster.
"Who will now seek to revive it? The
arbitrary power of the military caste of
Germany which once could secretly and of
its own choice disturb the peace of the
world is discredited and destroyed. And
more than that much more than that-.
has been accomplished. The great nations
which associated themselves to destroy it
have new definitely united in the common
purpose to set up such a peace as will satis
fy the longing of the whole world for dis
interested justice, embodied in settlements
which are based upon something much
better and much more lasting than the self
ish competitive interests of powerful states.
There is no longer conjecture as to the ob
jects the victors have in mind. They have
a mind in the matter, not only but a heart
as well. Their avowed and concerted in
tention is to satisfy and protect the weak
as well as to accord their just rights to
the strong.
"The humane temper and intention of
the victorious governments has already
been manifested in a very practical way.
Their representatives in the supreme war
council at Versailles have by unanimous
resolution assured the peoples of the cen
tral powers that everything that is possible
in the circumstances will be done to sup
ply them with food and relieve the dis
tressing want that is in so many places
threatening their very lives; and steps are
to be taken immediately to organize these
efforts at relief in the same systematic
manner that they were organized in the
case of Belgium. By the use of the idle
tonnage of the central powers it ought
presently to be possible to lift the fear of
utter misery from their oppressed popula
tions and set their minds and energies free
for the great and hazardous tasks of politi
cal reconstruction which now faces them
on every hand. Hunger does not breed
reform; it breeds madness and all the ugly
distempers that made an ordered life im
possible. "For with tRe fall of the ancient govern
ments which rested like an incubus upon
the peoples of the central empires, -has
come political change not merely, but rev
olution; and revolution which seems as
yet to assume no final and ordered form
but to run from one fluid change to an
other until thoughtful men are forced to
ask themselves, with w'hat governments
and of what sort are we about to deal in
the making of the covenants of peace?
With what authority will they mcetus, and
with what assurance that their authority
will abide and sustain securely the inter
national arrangements into which we are
. . . - , i
about to enter r lhere is here matter tor
no small anxiety and misgivings. When
peace is made, upon whose promises and
engagements besides our own is it to rest?
Let us be perfectly frank with ourselves
and admit that these terms cannot be sat
isfactorily arranged at once. But the moral
is that there is nothing to give us pause.
It is only that we must be patient and help
ful and mindful above all of the great hope
and confidence that lie at the heart of what
is taking place. Excesses accomplish noth
ing. Unhappy Russia has furnished abund
ant recent proof of that. Disorder immedi
ately defeats itself. If excesses should oc
cur, if disorder should for a time raise its
head, sober, second thought will convince
us that our action can only hinder.
"The present and all that it holds, be
longs to the nations and peoples who pre
serve their self-control and the orderly
processes of their governments ; the future
to those who prove themselves true friends
of mankind. ' To conquer with arms is to
make only a temporary conquest; to con
quer the world by earning its esteem is to
make permanent conquest. I am confident
that the nations that have learned the dis
cipline of freedom and that have settled
with self possession to its ordered prac
tice are now about to make conquest of
the world by the sheer power of example
and of friendly helpfulness.
"The peoples who have but just come
out from under the yoke of arbitrary gov
ernments and who are now coming at last
into their freedom will never find the treas
ures of liberty they are in search of if they
look for them by the light of the torch.
They will find that every pathway that is
stained with the blood of their own broth
ers leads to the wilderness, not to the seat
of their hope. They are now face to face
with their initial tests. We must hold the
light steady until they find themselves.
And in the meantime, if it be possible, we
must establish a peace that will justly de
fend their place among the nations, remove
all fear of their neighbors and of their for
mer masters, and enable them to live in
security and contentment when they have
set their own affairs in order. I, for one,
do not doubt their purpose or their capa
city. There are some happy signs that
they know and will choose the way of self
control and peaceful accommodation. If
they do, we shall put our aid at their dis
posal in every way that we can. If they do
not, we must await with patience and
sympathy the awakening and recovery that
will assuredly come at last."

AFTER THE FIGHTING
Let us not make the mistake of imagin
ing that the war is over and the fruits of
victory are ready for the plucking the mo
ment peace is dcelared. As Herbert
Hoover said, in a recent statement:
"Our objects in the overthrow of all
autocracies in Europe and the establish
ment of government by the people is but
part of our great burden. For beyond this,
when these immediate objects are attained,
we still have before us the greatest prob
lems that our government has ever faced,
if we are to prevent Europe's immolation
in a conflagration of anarchy such as Rus
sia is plunged in today. '
"We must nurse Europe back to industry
and self-support, and we must ourselves
avoid entanglement in the process,"
It is indeed a huge task, and one which
we cannot avoid if we wish to press our
unselfish prffgram to its logical conculsion,
making the victory sure and lasting, and in
suring the peace and prosperity of man
kind hereafter.
The menace of widespread anarchy is
only too evident. There is grave danger
that Austria-Hungary, in the intoxication
of new freedom and the difficulties of po
litical reconstruction, may go the way of
Russia. The Bolshevik movement is grow
ing rapidly in Austria. There is danger
that Germany may revert to internal strife
subversive of present order and protentous
for the future. There are perplexing prob
lems of race and territory in Turkey. There
are dangerous under-currents of discontent
in the ranks of labor in allied and neutral
countries.
Order, which is Heaven's first law, is
the first duty of peace. Order must be re
stored everywhere. That is a task second
in magnitude only to the task which the
forces of civilization are just now finishing.
Having crushed the greatest military men
ace in history, we must now crush the men
ace of political and social confusion.
We must begin by helping to police and
control every country that needs it, until
the nations concerned can get on their feet
and manage their own affairs. We cannot
shirk that duty even if we would like to,
because our own safety and happiness are
involved.

BELGIUM STATES
STATUS CHANGED
(By Review Leased Wire)
WASHINGTON, Mov. 12. The Bel
gian legation in an official statement
today announced that Belgium will no
longer submit to a status of "guaran
teed neutrality" like that which ex
isted before tne war. It aspires "to
complete independence; to the rights
common to all free peoples."
A return to "the status quo of 1839,"
the .statement said, "will entail a per
petual intrusion by Germany upon the
domestic life of the nation and create
a situation "intolerable to public opin
ion and certain to cause serious diffi
culties." "The note of June 24, 1917," said the
statement, "addressed by the Belgian
government to the pope in reply to the
pontifical message, advances as one
of indispensible conditions of a just
peace aa far as Belgium is concerned
'political, economic and military inde
pendence without condition or restric
tion." " ,
"Belgium must be allowed freedom
to determine her own destiny; she
must be free to adopt of her own voli
tion, a policy which shall keep her
outside of the great international com
petitions and permit her if some new
danger should threaten to meet and
necessary measures to defeat the hos
tile designs directed against her.
"The future of the country will de
pend on the wisdom and the will ot
the nation as well aa upon the con
stant interest of all the great powers,
in a free, strong Belgium. The interest
of the powers in the maintenance or
her Independence is in itself a sub
stantial and durable guarantee to
which treaties add but a formal ex
ternal confirmation. What weight and
what confidence, for example, could
Belgium attach to the renewal by Ger
many of an agreement which has been
so brutally and cynically broken?
Such a promise would be purely de
risive. "Moreover, the events ot the last
four years render a return to the
status quo of 1S39 impossible. It would
entail a perpetual intrusion by Ger
many upon the domestic life of the na
tion. The enemy, the invader, the oc
cupant of yesterday, would not fail
to keep a Jealous watch over the exe
cution of the obligations which he had
imposed upon the country and would
subject it to a regime of superinten
dence and investigation intolerable to
public opinion, and certain to cause
serious difficulties."

Our boys in France are the most home

the American soldiers desire nothing more

BY REVIEW
NEW YORK, Nov. 12 The calm,
matter of fact manner lu which to
day's stock market regulated lis af
fairs from war to peace was doubt
less a surprise to many who expecied
that the first post-bellum session of
the exchange would of necessity be
attended by sensational incidents.
With the exception of United Slates
Steel and a few other popular indus
trials of the pronounced war type,
prices were 1 to 3 points 'higher at
the opening, rails, shippings, oils ami
motors guiding the movement.
' Before the end of the first hour
most advances were materially re
duced and by midday virtually ail
gains were changed to actual losses
of 2 to 5 points, pressure centering in
munitions and allied equipments. The
last half of the session was charac
terized by a moderate revival of the
first hour's activity and more insist
ent liquidation in which the entire 1st
participated. Washngton's reminder
that some of the hardest problems
of the war await solution gave mo
mentus to the latter decline. x
Oils went through their ustial gyra
tions, Mexican Petroleum making an
extreme loss of 114 points from its
early gain of 3 points.
Motors, coppers and tobaccos end
ed at recessions of 1 to 4 points, also
the various specialties which follow
in their train and rails of high and
low degree forfeited more than their
,manr substantial gains of rhe first
hour. Sales amounted to 1.100,000
shares.
Bonds were irregular, foreign issues
j yielding part of their advance. Total
sales, par value, aggregated $10,
175,000. Old United States bonds were un
changed on call. -

Oats gained to ?i. The outcome in
provisions aried from 55c decline
to a rise of 30c.
Not withstanding that fighting with
Germany had ceased, a majority of
dealers in corn showed from the out
set a preference for the buying side
of the market. Recent setbacks
amounting to more than 50 cents a
bushel seemed t have left but little
inducement to sell, and commission
houses on the contrary had numerous
orders to purchase. Owing to ab
sence of selling orders, the market
advanced readily, but later was de
pressed by reports that a grain block
ade existed in the east. Rallies, how
ever, soon set in, and the market in
the last hour had again a pronounced
upward slant.
Oats sympathized with corn, and
followed the trend of that cereal.

MERCHANT MARINE
WASHINGTON. Nov. 12 Or
ders to rush recruiting men for
the crews of merchant ships were
sent today to shipping board
ag-nts in all parts of the coun
try. "We shall want thousands of
men for our floets," Chairman
Hurley said. "Our recruiting serv
vice and training ships will keep
right on preparing men for jobs
on merchant ships.
"The service is training at pres
ent 4 1 00 apprentices a month and
we are planning to increase its
output. The shipping board will
them because of past associations.
Thus it was that "Doc" Clifford
knew the man who climbed over the
railing in front of the Phelps Dodge
store after he had spoken Monday.
In the same manner he knew the wo
man who waved from the audience
and held up for the "Doc's" view a lit
t!e bundle of wriggling smiles.
A year ago the man would have
said, "Ho do you do. Dr. Clifford?"
But times change.
"Hello, Doc," he shouted as he grab
bed the parson's fist. "Come on down
and see the wife and baby."
Doc went down and met the wife
and baby. He talked with them for a
few moments, was hurled on through
the crowd, and so far as the rest of
the Warren district knew, he forgot
the man and the woman and the bun
dle of wiggling legs and arms.
Doc went to his Imtel and rested 15
minutes. Then took the stage to Tomb
stone. He spoke for an hour in Tomb
stone, clambered into the. automobile
again and returned to Bisbce. Again
he spoke, this time at the city park.
Six o'clock saw the Doc in Camp
Lowell, that little army post near Lo
well where soldiers of the United
States do duty for the benefit of resi
dents of the Warren district. He talk
ed to the soldiers for an hour, and
taught them to sing that popular song
of the trenches, "Katy."
Then for an hour the Doc disappear
ed dropped out of sight. No one mar
veled. He had a right to the rest if
he wanted it. He had been going
since before daylight. He had spoken
at four meetings, twice to thousands
in open air meetings. He was entitled

wanted it. Everyone agreed to this,
ami none sought to disturb him.
The Doc came into the doors of the
hotel smiling. I lis friends looked up
startled; they had thought he had
been in his room. The Doc was more
enthusiastic than he had been during
the whole of the peace celebrations of
the day. He was flowing over with a
story not of the trenches, but of Ari
zona and Tucson and Bisbee and the
Wayen district ami the working men
of rae district. He spoke rapidly, earn
estly, enthusiastically.
"Just been to a christening." he told
his friends. "Just christened a wrig-
glin little bundle of smiles."
Then the Doc told of how he mar
i ried the working man and the working
) girl in Tui son long before he left the
! little church of the old Pue.blo to see
service abroad. He told of the man's
climbing over the railing to meet him.
and of his seeing the woman and the
baby in the audience. When he had
i concluded his meeting with the sol-
diers. he told them, he had slipped
j quietly off to the home of his old
I friends of Tucson, the couple whom he
:had seen in church, and whom he had
married. There, in the Bisbee home
of this couple, the Rev. Dr. Clifford
iof a year ago. transformed to the Doc
Clifford of today christened the first
born of this couple.
"And that isn't the best part of the
story," continued the Doc. "When 1

that he had changed his mind about
the United war work drive. He had
intended giving one shift to the cam

FOUR BILLIONS
ANNUAL NEED OF
OUR GOVLRNfvlENl
(Continued from Pago Onto
ure. It the $16,b3U,Ou0,uuu ot Liberty
Bonds already l&sueu are increased iu
vomme uy later loans to 25,ooi,UUU,
UUU tne interest on this sum would
amount to aoout $l,uou,uuu,uuu a year.
In addition, it prouaoiy will be the
government s policy to establish a
sinking lund to pay off the bonds at
maturity, and this would require aoout
$l,230,0uu,uuu. These three items
would niaae an aggregate near $4,2aU,-
0UU.0U0.
To offset this, there would be nearly
a half billion dollars coining in an
nually lroin the allies as interest on
tneir loans, which now amounts to $7,
uuo.uoo.uuo and are likely to run mucu
nigner; and revenue from customs and
miscellaneous sources, which last
year amounted to about $450,uoo,ouo.
With allowances tor w ide variations
in these calculations, there would still
remain aoout tnree and a half billion
Uo.lars to be raised iroiu internal rev
enue taxes. Last year $3,t43,UUU,UU0
came from internal revenue, including
$2,775,000,UU0 trom income and excess
profits taxes. This year these figures
prooably will be more than doubled.
Factors which make this system of
estimates highly tentative, officials
point out are that the war is not yet
definitely over, so far as expenses is
concerned and that war debts both of
the American government, the public
and the allied governments to the
United States cannot be figured until
then.
The method of applying taxes after
the war also are receiving attention.
If the schedule of income taxes now
being framed in the new revenue bill
works out well, it is considered prob
able that the bulk of after the war
revenues will come from income lev
ies, which next year will yield probab
ly (2,300,000,000. Excess profits taxes
probably would automatically be
abandoned after the war, and liquor
revenues will stop if the constitutional
prohibition amendment is ratified, and
sooner with the passage of the "war
time" prohibition bill. It is almost
certain that the multitude of uiinor
taxes now levied on transportation,
insurance, admissions, club dues, and
special taxes on certain businesses,
now yielding comparatively little rev
enue and very difficult of administra
tion will be abandoned. Tobacco anc
estate taxes probably will remain, it
is said.

My mother bought me a bottle of

taking the first bottle, so kept it up till I
took three ... I gained, and was well

if I need a tonic. I am glad to testify to

PROGRESS
WAR
vORK DRIVE
Returns on Cards Up to Date
Indicate That People Are
Alive to Necessity of Rais
ing Fund
Reports oi the team captains of
work accomplished in the first day of
the united war work campaign were
received at the first of the regular
nocn-day workers' luncheons, held yes
terday noon at the Y. M. C. A. lounge
rooms. Reports show that nearly all
of the teams have started work, that
i the canvas of cards is progressing
rapidly, and indicate that before the
end of the week the majority of the
cards on which the campaign is being
conducted will have been returned
with results.
One of the features of the meeting
was the tone of subscribers reported
by the workers. Ia only one instance
did the workers find residents of the
district who believed that because an
armistice had been signed the funds of
the drive were unnecessary. When
the workers explained that two years
of reconstruction and policing in Eu
rope will demand the attention of
troops of the United States, the objec
tions were removed, and the subscrib
er gave liberally. On the whole work
ers reported that they have been meet
ing with extraordinary spirit of will
ingness on the part of the residents
of this district.
With organization work only partial
ly completed reports from over the
county indicate that more than $33,000
of the county's quota of $70,500 is al
ready raised. In this district it is dif
ficult to state what had been suo
scribed up to yesterday noon, but a
conservative estimate of all subscrip
tions reported to date in the district
will reach almost $12,000. Douglas
has already over-subscribed its quota,
making the total of their assigned $27,
500 from their war chest. In addition
they have pledged to raise an addition
al fund to bring their total to at least
$40,000.
The first district to go over the top
from the small outside towns has been
Bowie, which on Monday wired J. N.
Gaines, county director, that the $163.
90 quota has been raised and over
subscribed, with a total to date of
$170.60. Mrs. J. K. Symonds, chairman
of this districts wired for more sup
plies to take care of additional pledges
which will swell the Bowie quota by
several more dollars, Reports from
the other outside districts are that the
captains and chairmen are working
and that all of them will raise their
quotas.
An instance of how the residents of
the Warren district are responding to
the call for funds for united war work
was told at the offices of the commer
cial club, where war work headquar
ters are made, yesterday. One of the
district's citizens called at the head
quarters for a button. He was in
formed by J. N. Gaines, county di
rector, that only those who had
pledged were given buttons.
"Then give me some pledge card3,"
he demanded.
He filled out two cards and tossed
them across the desk to Mr. Caines.
"I guess that entitles me to two but
tons," he declared.
The two cards read for around
$1000, divided equally between himself
and his 'wife. He received his two
buttons.
The second meeting of the team
captains and workers at regular lunch
eon wiU be held at the Y. M. C. A.
loungo rooms this noon at 1 o'clock.
At this meeting the first comprehen
sive report of the accomplishments
in the district will be read when team
captains will 'despond to the roll call
with the total amount they have col
lected and tne number of pledges rep
resented in this total. It is pointed
out that the sum pledged is not the
gauge for team work, but the number
of pledges received.

FROM
HUNS fiOW !il
UNITED STATES
Lieutenant Isaacs, Who Was
Formerly Stationed at Ft
Huachuca and Was Cap
tured by Submarine, Safe
According to advices received here
Vic-jjr Issars, of the I'nited States
l navy, and a son-iii-hrv of Maj. G.'n.
j Diiaisey Cabell, and escaped German
prisoiiL-r. has readied the I mted
Suites. Lieutenant Isaacs was sta
tioned at t"t. Huachuca for a number
of months and made frequent visit
to the Wiirren district and is quite
well known here. The story of his
return U (.Tveu under a New York
date line of November 11th, and is as
follows:
NEW YORK. Nov. 11. Victor
Isaacs. I. S. N.. an officer on the
American transport President Lin
coin, sunk by a German submarine on
May 31, who is credited by other ser
vivors with having surrendered him
self to the l"-boat commander in order
; to save hU captain from capture, re
turned Sundav to Cw. L'niled State?,
after escaping from a G iman prison
and swimming the Rhine. He made
his way to England by way of Switz
erland snd embarked there on a I'rit
ish liner.
Lieut. Isaacs, an Annapolis gradu
ate, whose home is in fresco. Iowa,
declined to discuss his experiences,
stating that he was obliged first to
report to the navy department.
Flees Detention Camp
It was learned, however, from other
lassengers, that with 12 other Ameri
can and Priiish prisoners, he broke
away from the German detention
camp at Vflllngen, rSlden, on Oc
tober 6.
After climbing over the electrically
charged wires that guarded the camp,
they separated, and on October 13,
Lieutenant Isaacs rervhed the Rhine.
Finding no other way !c cross that
river, he plunsed In and swam it, and,
by traveling at nl:;ht managed to
reach the Swiss frontier.
Of the other 12 prisoners who made
the dash for liberty. Lieu tenant Issacs
said he had heard three besUes him
self reached Switzerland.
U-Boat Takes Isaacs
When the President Lincoln was
sunk, .ho submarine went alongside
the boats and demanded that the exp
lain or other officer of aigh rank be
turned over to them. The ship's of
ficers had removed their epaulets and
t!'e Germans, exasperated that an of
ficer did not immediately surrender,
threatened to hold an entire boatload.
Then Lieutenant Isaacs gave himse'.f
up. remarking that it "was the for
tunes of war."
Unbearable Treatment
Questioned concerning his treat
ment, he replied hat the only treat
ment ghrn him by the Germans that
even resembled decency was on the
!ubmarine and that "was nothing for
hem to be prend of." He said the
Germans were then overbearing and
arrogant, believing they were winning
the war and holding the I'nited States
and the allies in contempt. After
landing, ho added, the treatment he
jeccived was almost unbearable. The
tnod was scanty and of poor quality
ind his captors delighted in venting
their, anger on him and other pris
iners.

OFFICERS' TRAINING
GAMPS DISCONTINUE
BY BAKER'S ORDER
NOVEMBER LIST WILL NOT BE
CALLED AND GRAVE DOUBT AS
TO WHETHER PRESENT STU

EXISTS AT PRESENT
(Bv Review Inea TVIre)
WASHINGTON, Nov. U'. Orders
were issued today by the war depart
ment discontinuing accepting of ap
plicants for the central officers' train
ing camps and stopping the organiza
tion of any new classes. There are
now approximately 100,000 men in
training at' these camps operating on
a monthly class basis.
The November classes will be dis
continued and a decision is expected
as to whether present classes shall be
continued to graduation. None of the
additional training camps for officers
t hut had been planned wil be estab
lished. Ti:e future of the student officers'
trui::iiii? units in universities and
other schools also now is worked out.
Secretary Baker said today that th.;
question of the best way to stop this
work with the least disruption to the
institutions Involved i being consid
ered by the college official associat
ed v ith the government in the work
and also by the general staff. A
policy will be worked cit. the secre
tary said, that will turn the colleges
back to their regular pursuits as
quickly as possible without causing
losses to the institutions.
Mr. Baker indicated that no definite
decision has yet been reached as to
the future of various army divisions,
new completely organized or beins
formed at cantosraents in this coun
try. Asked if these organizations
might see service in Europe he said
he could not answer.
In this connection, however, it was
learned that orders already issued ef
fectually check the development of
those divisions which have not yet
teen fully rganized. Transfers of
officers and other steps necessary to
completing organization "have been
curtailed.

more clearly than ever what a mis
