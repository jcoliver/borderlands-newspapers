in Which Order of Being Brought Into Service Is De

Aware of Their Classification and Know They Must Join

(By Review Leased TVlre)
WASHINGTON, June 27 Near
ly 800,000 young men of twenty
one who registered for military
service last June 5 had their or
der in the draft classes fixed to
day by a second national draft
lottery held with formal ceremony
at the senate office building.
Just 1200 numbered slips rolled
into capsules enough to cover
the list of new registrants in the
largest local district in the coun
try were drawn from a big glass
bowl and the numbers recorded in
serial order. Under the law all
the new registrants go at the bot
tom of the classes to which they
may be assigned, and the order in
which the number appearing on
each man's registration came from
the bowl determines his place in
the list of additions.
The task was done in about two
hours. After a brief explanatory

WASHINGTON, June 27.
Pledges for the installment pur
chase of more tban a half billion
dollars of war savings and thrift
stamps have been received in the
last two weeks by war savings
workers throughout the country,
and this probably will be doubled
tomorrow, designated by Presf

thrift and war savings stamps
have been less than the govern

about $300,000,000 since last De

bond bill, authorizing eight billion
dollars of Libery bonds in addition to
all heretofore authorized, was framed
today by the house ways and means
committee, in preparation for the next

essary. Authorization is outstanding
for $9,000,000,000 in bonds and the
next issue probably will be arounl
$6,000,000,000. .
Besides authorizing $8,000,000,000
more "bonds for domestic purposes the
bill, which was approved by the com

Senator Expresses Doubt as to
Truth of Statement That

WASHINGTON, June 27. Debates
on the Fail amendment to the twelve
billion dollar army appropriation bill
rioviding for extension of the draft
a.jes to 20 and 40 years, was resume I
in the senate today, Lut considera
tion of the measure was so delayed by
the 1'ght on the suffrage amendment
resolution that 8 vote wag not reached.
Leaders tonight hoped to dispose of
the amendment and possibly pass the
b'.ll tomorrow.
At the conclusion of the brief dis
cussion today. Senator Fall said he
expected his effort to extend the draft
ages would be fjtile and the general
opinion of senators seemed to be that
the amendment would be rejected.
Senator Reed of Missouri, democratic
member of the senate military com
mittee. Lodge of Massachusetts, Cum
mins of Iowa, in urging upon the sen
ate the necessity for immediate exten
sion of the draft ages challenged the
opinion of Secretary' Baker and Gen
eral March, chief-oi-staff. that the leg
islation Is not needed at this 'time.
The Missouri senator, however, said
he would bow to the decision of the
war department officials.
"Before we are through with this
war we will have to put five to seven
million troops in Europe, I think," con
tinued Senator Reed. "Bachelors of
30 and 40 should be called before the
married men of 21 to 30."
American newspapers said that tha
senate "have handled the war like a
good political paper handles its' party
affairs,' adding that the people of the
country need not be boosted up about
our side of the case."
Stories that Austria is about to fall
to pieces, that food riots are frequent
and that the country is about to re
bel were regarded bv Senator Reed as
"part of a skillfuly laid plan to lull
the world Into slothfulness."
Senator Lodge, urged that the draft
age limits be extended n5w, declaring
that it would eliminate possibility of
delay, which he asserted had been
"our great trouble," in the conduct of
the war. He opposed lowering the
draft limit below 21 but ravored its
extension to 40 years.
Senator Cummins of Iowa said that
if the senate had adopted the resolu
tion offered last month, calling for in
formation from department officials re
garding man power needed, for mili
tary, industrial and agricultural pur
poses, it now would have informa
tion that "would make it Imperative

Extensive Hearings of Effect
of Prohibition .as War
Measure Held by Commit
tee Before Report
(T!v Review Leased Wire)
WASHINGTON, June- 27. Carrying
an amendment providing for national
prohibition as a war measure, but not
fully effective until June 30. 191. the
$11,000,000,000 emergency agricultural
appropriation bill was reported late
today to the senate. The present plan
is to call it up after the army bill Is
disposed of and a bitter fight is ex
pected by many senators.
The prohibition amendment offived
by Senator Norris of Nebraska, as a
substitute for that by Senator Jones
of Washington, was adopted today by
the senate agriculture committee,
eight to three. It prohibits the s?le
of distilled spirits and the manufac
ture of wine or the removal of liquors
now held in bond after June 30, 1919.
The manufacture of beer would be
stopped three months after passage of
the bill.
The amendment was approved by
the committee at t three hour essicn
during which opponents made futile ef
forts to have it amended bo as to per
mit the manufacture and sale of beer
for six and then four months after en
actment. Efforts to have the committee re
commend passage of prohibition legis
lation in a separate measure also era
unsuccessful.
Extensive hearings on the question
of prohibition during the war were
held by the committee. The proposal
was opposed and approved by , high
government officials and others.
Chairman Hurley and Bainbridge
Colby of the shipping board were
among the chief opponents, because of
the effect they feared the taking ot
beer from the workmen would have on
the ship building industry.
Secretary Daniels disagreed with
the view of shipping board officials.
Mr. Daniels, who did not appear as an
advocate of prohibition, but at the re
quest of the committee said that aft
er the sale of liquor was stopped
around the Mare Island navy yard and
the new port torpedo station, the work
men showed greater efficiency, the
outputs of both plants increasing.
Senator Sheppard of Texas, and oth
er pr6hibition leaders were confident
tonight of the passage of the prohibi
tion amendment. They said that since
the senate last year adopted by a two
thirds vote the resolution to submit
to the states a prohibition constitution
al amendment, a majority vote in sup
port of the present proposal easily
could be secured. Opponents, how
ever, expected a strong fight to be
made in view of the fact that the con
stitutional amendment now is awaiting
action by the states.
The new amendment provides:
"That from and after June 30. 1919.
after the approval of this act, and dur
ing the continuance of the present
war. for the purpose of conserving the
man power of the nation and to in
crease the efficiency In the production
of army, war munitions, food and
clothing for the army, it shall be un
lawful to sell, for beverage purposes
except for export, any distilled spirits
and no distilled spirits held in bond

there as the spokesman of his coun

of the new-born Russian democracy
to the great republic overseas.
Kerensky within a few days will zo
to France and thence to the United
States. His friends say the former
premier does not like the word inter

Russia but prefers the phrase help
and reconstruction. How Kerensky
escaped from Russia and how his com

consideration, and before being put
into operation will require much con

The revival of the plan of sending
material aid to the distressed country,
such as seeds, agricultural imple

them with sufficient forces to safe
guard these resources from falling in

upon the approval of the allies ami
the consent of the Russian people.
It has been suggested the govern
ment might take advantage of a visit
from former Premier Kerenskr to the
United States as a means of Informing
itself of intimate details. So far as
could be learned today, a visit from
the former premier still was an un

LOAN ISSUE OF

(Continued from Pace On)
position to make plans before hand for
the fourth liberty loan in the fall." said
Mr. McAdoo. This authorization is
greater than wodd be issued in the
fourth loan but ir the practice which
was adopted successfully in the third
loan of making allotments in full upo.
ail over-subscriptions is followed, it
will be necessary to have a substantial
margin to cover any possible over
subscription." Under the new bill only banks and
trust companies which are qualified
government depositories would be al
lowed to take subscriptions for further
by any outward signs, of preparations
by the Germans.
Although the infantry operations ex
cept by the Americans in the Belleau
wood have scarcely risen in import
ance above patrol encounters recently,
the Germans are trying out with artil
lery the stability of the British and
French positions on various sectors
from Flanders to the Marne. South
west of Armentieres on the Lys sector,
and between Givenchy and Robecq,
the British lines have been heavily
shelled with guus of all sizes and with
considerable numbers of gas projec
tiles. The French have been receiving
similar visitations between the Oise
and Aisne rivers especially in the re
gion north of Villers-Cotterets, where
the recent German offensive reached
its greatest depth in the attempted
dash to Paris.
When or where the next offensive is
to be launched cannot be foretold, but
it is expected that it will be started
and carried oat in an ambitious man
ner, for it seemingly is realized that
time now is working against German
arms in the west and that hasie is
necessary. This fact is being deeply
impressed on the German high com
mand, especially as it daily is witness
ing the arrival of increasing numbers
of Americans on the battle front and
is coming to realize that they are foe
men of the highest merit.
For the moment the Germans seem
resigned to their loss to the Americans
of the Belleau wood, northwest of
Chateau Thierry. No counter attacks
have been made in an endeavor to re
gain the lost ground. The latest ac
count of the Americans' victory shows
that the troops from overseas, in ad
dition to killing or wounding maiy of
the enemy, took 311 prisoners, eleven
machine guns and ten automatic rifles
and a Jar go quantity, of ammunititou
and other war stores.
All is quiet along the Piave vhe-o
the Italians are secure in the positions
from which they drove the Austriaus.
In the mountain region there has been
considerable fighting in which the Ital
ians seem to have had the upper hand.
Announcement has been ma'le by
Secretary of War Baker that a regi
ment of American troops from the ex
peditionary forces of General Pershing
has been ordered to the Italian front.
On their arrival, which is expected
shortly, the Austrians will have fac
ing them men from Italy, the Uniied
States, England and France.

BUDAPEST SITUATION
AMSTERDAM, June 27. 1 udapest
advices received here say that iu the
lower house of parliament Wednesday
Dr. Alexander Wekerle, the Hungarian
premier, drew a gloomy picture of con
ditions in Budapest. The premier said
most of the factories had ceased, work
and that the non-appearance of the
newspapers had resulted in a regret
able spreading of false rumcrs which
had fanned the agitation among the
working people.
BRITISH OFFICIAL
LONDON. June 27. The war office
communication issued tonight says:
"Casualties were inflicted on the
enemy during the night in patrol en
counters in the neighborhood of Boy
elles. "There is nothing further to report
except artillery activities by both sides
on certain sectors."
FRENCH OFFICIA
PARIS. June 27 The war announce
ment tonights says:
"There was no infantry activity. The
artillery fire was intermittent on vari
ous sectors between the Oise and the
Aisne." 1
AUSTRIA IS HOPELESS
PARIS, June 27. Austria is in seri
ous difficulties but there is great
danger in hoping too much from
them, says a French official summary
commenting on the situation in the
dual monarch. Little hope is seen in
the possibility of a successful revolt.
Austria cannot negotiate a separate
peace and it would be "bad policy to
extend a hand to her now."
BRITISH AERIAL REPORT
LONDON, June 27. An official com
munication on aerial operations to
night says:
"Seven German machines were
brought down by our airmen on June
26 and two others were driven down
out of control. Two of our airplanes
are missing."
GERMAN OFFICIAL
BERLIN, via London, June 27. The
official communication from general
headquarters today says:
"There is no change in the situation.
Lively enemy activity has been dis
played north of the Scarpe and on the
Somme, west of Soissons and north
west of Rheima. The enemy's observ
ers have again been seen on the
Rheims cathedral.
"During the night the artillery ac
tivity increased again on the rest of
the front; also' between the Aisne and
the Marne in connection with infantry
reconnaissances.
"On the east bank of the Meuse we
carried out successful reconnaissances
north of SL Miehiel. A strong enemy
attack was repulsed.
"Five airplanes were shot down out
of an enemy bombing cholon which
during the lat two days has raided
Karlsruhe and Offenberg.
"Yesterday our bombing squadrons
attacked Paris and the enemy's rail
way junctions and airdromes on the
way there."
The announcement by the German
high command that enemy observers
have been seen on Rheims cathedral
is usually the preliminary to a bom
bardment of that edifice. The French
authorities have denied that the cathe
dral was ever used for observation
purposes.
There is little left of the edifice but
the west front and the pillars.

NEW YORK, June 27. Speculative
stocks, particularly, secondary indus
trials, equipments, oils ad a wide
variety of unclassified issues, aug
mented recent advances in today's
broader trading, but standard shares
were irregular, when not actually
heavy.
The demand for rails was a?nin re
stricted to Heading and a few relative
ly unimportant transportations, while
transcontinental were under further
pressure and United States steel re
acted from its new maximum for the
current movement of 110, closing at
a loss of a substantial fraction. Sales
650.000 shares.
The general bend market was eas

strong on purchases attributed to cor

GRAIN
CHICAGO. June 27. Severe hot
weather southwest and a dangerous
lask of moisture thereb rought about
advances today in the corn market.
Prices closed nervous. to cents
net higher, with July $1.46 to $1.46
and August $1.49 to $1.49. Oats
gained to lc. In provisions the
outcome ranged from 10 cents decline
to a raise of 15 cents.
Anxiety prevailed over the small
ness of stocks of corn available in Chi
cago for delivery on July contracts,
especially as a reduction of the move
ment from rural sources appeared
.probabje. owing to the greater neces
sity of cars for newly harvested wheat.
Later, however, sentiment became
more or less unsettled as a result of
good rains in Iowa.
Unconfirmed talk of export business
gave an upward slant to the oats
market. -
Strength of hogs and grain made
provisions average higher.

A TRIBUTE
(Major Kelly, in Daily International)
In the early days he traveled through
Arizona by stage, soon becoming interested
and interesting others, with him in copper
properties at Morenci, Globe, in Yavapai
county and Nacozari, Mexico. All these
properties have become great producers
and from these camps have not only come
vast amounts of wealth, but from them
have also come many of the distinguished
mining men of Arizona, who were trained
under the direction of Dr. Douglas. Among
these may be named Dr. L. D. Ricketts, C.
E. Mills, Walter and J. S. Douglas, J. S.
Williams, jr., P. C. Beckett and A. T.
Thomson. In the development of copper
in Arizona and in the introduction of new
methods of treatment Dr. Douglas was the
acknowledged leader until a few years ago
when his health, beginning to fail, he gave
up work, relinquishing the presidency of
the Phelps Dodge corporation to his son
Welter, though still being retained as the
president of the operating board of that
company.
The citj' of Douglas was named after
the distinguished man who has just passed
away. It was he who planned the construc
tion of the El Paso & Southwestern railway
from Bisbee to El Paso and selected the
spot now occupied by this city as the place
for diverting the Nacozari railroad to Naco
zari, Mexico, to serve the Moctezuma Cop
per company, an enterprise which he had
built in Mexico to great proportions. It is
known that he always took much interest
in the growth of this city and he hai done
much to provide in the early days many
conditions to make lite easier and more and
more comfortable for the citizens, and
especially for those employed at the smelter
here. The citizens of Douglas have every
cause for deep regret and sorrow because
of the death of Dr. Douglas. Many there
be here and in Bisbee, who can look back
with appreciation to the many kindnesses
and care which resulted to their individual
benefit; the loss of Dr. Douglas will be sin
cerely regretted in all sections of Arizona
and by all classes of citizens, for be it said
that no other man did more for' the devel
opment of this great mineral state than did
Dr. Douglas, who far many years devoted
his great energy and distinguished scientific
knowledge to the welfare of this state.
In Bisbee, Douglas, Morenci and every
other camp in which Dr. Douglas was inter
ested may be seen public libraries, gymna
siums, churches and schools which have
been created as a means of promoting a
high class citizenship by this good man who
was ever planning for the best interests of
those in his employ.
INCREASED EFFICIENCY TO BE
REWARDED
The bonus system for employes recently
announced by the mining companies oper
ating in Bisbee and Douglas, will go into
effect on the first of July, coming. The
plan is a decided innovation in the ordin
ary methods and was put into effect for
several reasons. The plan proposes that
each man in the employ of the company for
one year shall receive an additional bonus
of $ 1 00, with $ 1 0 extra for each additional
year of service up to a maximum of $250,
when no additional bonus will be paid.
At the present time a man gets his daily
wage, $5.35, irrespective of his age, his
skill, his length of service or any of the
other factors that go to make up his indi
vidual effort and the skill which he has
acquired of a bonus, however, it is recog
nized to some extent that a man who has
been in the employ of the company 'for a
year and longer is worth more to the com
pany for his individual effort and the skill
which he has acquired than a new man, a
thing that is not provided for by a standard
and fixed scale of wages.
In January, 1 91 8, the companies of the
Warren district announced that every man
who had been in their service continuously
for one year would receive $100 bonus,
with $50 for six months' service, and the
Phelps Dodpe corporation at thai time paid
$ 1 8 1 , 1 20 to 3,286 employes. W hen it is
considered that the average number of em
ployes for the year was 3773 it will be seen
that two-thirds of the men had been with
the company six months or a year.
The bonus is not given as a reward for
staying one year with the company. But
labor turnover i3 costly; we all appreciate
the cost of breaking in new men, the costs
from accidents caused by new men and the
many other factors caused by a constantly
changing crew of workmen that increase
, cost. The fact that a workman stays with
the company a year or more decreases the
rate of labor turnover, and to a consider
able extent the company is giving the work
man the saving resulting- from thai decrease.
OUR POPULATION SHAKES OFF ITS
GERMAN BRANDS
Chicago Tribune: New names for old!
New names for old!
Daily grows the number of German
sounding surnames which are being trans
formed by the touch of a judge's pen into
cognomens which bear the label, "Made
in U. S. A." Sixteen people petitioned
the circuit court yesterday to have their
names changed, the reason for most of the
desired changes being self-evident.
For instance, there is Joseph Marcus
Kaiser, who asks that he be called Mr.
Kaye hereafter. William and Ernest
Schwartz have decided that they will trans
late their name to Black. Mr. and Mrs.
Helmer Smidt wish to increase the tribe of
Smiths and so also does William Schmidt.
An abbreviation is all that Raymond P.
Schandelmeier asks for. He wants to cut
his last name to Myer. Other names which
will have the sound of the fatherland cut
out, if the judges grant the wishes of their
owners, will be Schulz, Smaltz, and Apple
baum. Mr. and Mrs. Paul Saunders will
take the place of the first, Francis J. Small
will appear instead of the second, and Luis,
Elizabeth, and Dorothy Appleton will sub
stitute for the last.
WHAT BRITAIN HAS DONE
John Masefield, the English novelist,
writes a3 follows to the New York Times
to set that paper straight on Britain's ac
complishments and sacrifices in this war:
In your issue of today,' in the leading
article, headed "Changing the Draft Ages,"
your leader writer uses the following
words
"Great Britain, which has put 7,000,000
men into uniform and into war work at
home, and must have lost a good many
more than 1,000,000 men at the front,"
etc.
Will you allow me to say that your lead
er writer would have been more accurate
had he written, "Great Britain, which has
put nearly 8,000,000 men into the armies
and navy, and hardly -less than another
8,000,000 men and women into war work
at home and abroad, and as actually lost
in the field and at sea more than 2,500,000
men, besides some hundreds of thousands
incapacitated through sickness," etc.?
If preparations already under way may
be taken as a criterion, the ccming Fourth
of July will be celebrated by the Frenc't
in a manner which is unprecedented.
Maurice Damour, a member of the chamber
of deputies, has written a long article for
the Journal calling upon all Frenchmen to
join in the celebration. He writes: "The
Fourth of July is as much a French hol
iday as American. It is a world holiday.
France must not content itself with a few
official manifestations. The whole people
of France must celebrate. All the houses in
Paris, and the provinces must be decor
ated with French and American flags. Pro
cessions must be organized in Paris. Flow
ers must be deposited before the statue of
Washington and the American flag must
be raised at the same hour in all cities
towns, and villages of France. In all the
schools at the same moment, the teachers
should explain the meaning of the celebra
tion and the reasons why France and Amer
ica should remain united forever. Let us
celebrate July Fourth, which in I 776 saw
the birth of American liberty and one of
the noblest nations of the world."
No excitement attended the drawing of
numbers to decide the order in which the
class of 1918 shall be inducted into the
army. The scene in Washington was dif
ferent, quite, from that of the first draw
ing. The same equipment was used, but
the country has grown used to war and
the men, having ascertained their classifi
cation, know their induction into service
will follow within a short period. The
exact order matters little.
SIGNATURES SECURED
fiCHUM
GO ON BALLOT
Compensation Amendment to
Appear on Election Tickets
This Fall for Vote of the
People
PHOENIX. June 27. Proposed
amendment to the constitution to pro
vide compensation for injured work
men will appear on the ballot this
(all. In less than three weeks more
than 8744 signatures were made to tha
petitions for this measure to get it be
fore the voters, and are continuing to
come in.
The general confidence in and desir
ability of the measure has been riven
expression by not only the mining dis
tricts, where the largest numbr of
those coming under the protection of
the proposed amendment are, but also
from the farming and cattle coun
tries.
Means Strike Decrease.
In the mining districts it is realized
that the measure affords definite
terms and payments that are hitrher
man provided in any other state in the
union and that it will do awav with
me lawyer who In the past has been
the only real radicals of the clas. who
advocate keeping up strife between
employer and employes be excepted.
For these the present laws are hrer.rf
and meat, because they have accomp-
usnea more than any other single
thing, with the aid of the ambulance
chasing lawyers, in making inisun l?r-
standing and grief between employer
ana employe.
The personal injury lawyer and .he
labor radical of the class w ho wanted
a state-wide strike on May 1 with
which to tie up the copper so vital to
the government and its allic in the
war against the kaiser are, of course,
opposed to the proposed compensation
measure, because it will kill strife.
On the farmer's end the Interest in
and favor for the proposed amend
ment is due to both fairness toward
employer and employe and to realiza
tion that the working of the amend
ment would cut down general taxes
materially by reducing court expenses,
and at the same time free the rourts
of the congestion which has kept the
farmer, business men and cattiercen
waiting in line with legitimate ousi
ness. Neither the farmer nor the work
man pays any or the cost of the com
pensation provided under the proposal
amendment for injuries sustained, the
cost of this insurance being carried by
the employers, who will save the ex
penses of litigation and dissatisfaction
as well as sharing with the farmer
and general property owner and 'iior
chant in saving taxes. '
New Life for Small Enterprises.
One thing the proposed amendment
will do if adopted will have far-reaching
result. That is .in enabling small
capital to undertake the development
of new mineral areas. Under the pres
ent compensation law and employers'
liability law the leaser and those of
limited means who desire to develop
mining properties are confronted with
the fact that If they have an accident
of even comparatively minor character
they may be put out of business and
besides this lose every dollar they
have. This is the first thing they have
put up to them when they try to inter
est needed capital. It is a point that
has prevented a number of important
enterprises being undertaken in th
state in the last several years that
otherwise might today be turning
large payrolls and taxes to general
channels in the state.
Outrage Practiced
The small operator has no way out
except that he purchase insurance
from regular companies at from four
times to eight times what the insur
ance will cost him under the proposed
amendment. The latter, in addition,
frees him from all -responsibility,
which the regular insurance company
does not do. More than that, there are
cases on record where these regular
companies have made settlements of
insurance at a trifle of the full amount
provided for. The mine operator hab
gained nothing by this, and the bene
ficiary of the workman has suffered
as outrageously as have many of tho.se
who have gone into court with dam
age suits at the behest of personal in
jury lawyers, who have collected from
50 per cent to all of the awards ob
tained and put it in their pockets, leav
ing the rightful beneficiary to suffer.
The proposed amendment will change
all of this with its state guaranteed
insurance and its guarantee against
the meddling and mulcting of unde
sirable lawyers, agitators and grafters.

GAINED 15 POUNDS
AND TROUBLES END
Only Weighed 126 Pounds
When He Began Taking
Tanlac Now Weighs
141 Pounds
Besides getting complete relief from
my awful suffering 1 have actually
gained fifteen pounds, so you may
know by that what I think of Tanlac, '
said Nicholas Zimmerman, recently.
Mr. Zimmerman is employed at lac
Anderson ship yarns ana lives in Kirn
land, just across the lake from Seat
tle, Wash.
"For years," he continued, "my
stomach was in such a bad condition
that I could hardly digest anything.
What I would eat seemed to lodge
about half way down my chest, form
a lump that felt about as big as my
fist, and would just stay there. Tbe
pain was terrible and I could hardly
bear to touch myself at the pit vt
my stomach at all. I coukli.'t work,
and was just barely able to s'.ay
around my little place, where I raised
chickens. My back, right under my
shoulders hurt me, and 1 had such
fearful headaches that I couldn't keep
still. I got so I could hardly eat any
thing and was so nervous I could
scarcely sleep at all. I had fallen eff
until I weighed only one hundred urd
twenty-six pounds, and was in such
a bad fix that I hadn't bcn able to
do any work for sometime.
"Then Tanlac came along and after
reading some of the testimonials de
scribing cases similar to mine I decid
ed to try it and it has almost made a
new man of me. Before I had finisu
ed my first bottle I commenced to
feel good results and ever sinca laen
things have gone along fine with mo.
I don't believe I have had a headache
since I finished that first bottle and
my nerves are steady as a clock. 1
sleep as sound as a dollar, my appe
tite is great, and I can eat just t.ny
thing I want without suffering a par
ticle afterwards. I have been back on
the Job now for six weeks, never miss
ing a day, and I don't mind my work
in the least. I nbw weigh one hun
dred and forty-one pounds, which
gives me a gain of fifteen pounds. I
simply feel splendid and Tanlac gets
all the credit. Tanlac is great medi
cine, and I can conscientiously recom
mend it to everybody because of what
it has done for me."
Tanlac is sold in Bisbee by J. M.
Ball, in Douglas by Douglas Drug Co.,
in Paradise by G. A. Walker, in Bowie
by Bowie Drug Store, in San Simon by
J. B. Cooke, in WIllcox by A. A. Nichol

GOVERNOR IS STILL ,
HOLDING TWO BILLS
The sabotage and vagabond bills,
enacted by the special war session of
the legislature, are still in the hands
cf the governor and have not yet re
ceived tbe official signature to .make
them laws or the veto to consign them
to the waste basket. The bills were
transmitted to the governor on the last
day of the session, June 19, and the
governor may hold them for 10 days,
which brings them up to next Satur
day. At tbe end of that period if they
have not been veioed they become
laws without the gubernatoral signa
ture. These two bills caused more dis
cussion than any other measures pre
sented at the sesion, not excepting
the soldiers' voting bill, which was
bandid from senate to houise and house
to senate without ever being debated
in either branch to any extent. Also
these two bills are the only ones that
have, caused the governor auy hesi
tancy. In an ef!ort to kill these bills their
opponents offered and secured the ad-
opticn of sonic amendments that ap
pear f bsurd. but which the champions
of the measures claim will not inter
ierc with their effectiveness in ac
complishing their purpose. An amend-j
meiil to the vagabond bill gives jihe
state the right to take ever and oper
ate any property that Is not bcinj; op
erated to its full productiveness. The
satotaRC bill, in'ended to apply to in
dividuals who preach or practice sa
botage, was amended to include "or
porations, companies and organiza
tions. Each bill was opposed in h:nh
branches by those members known as
adminis; ration supporters and by somo
who claim to be "labor representatives."

TO GET RID OF
(By Review Leased Wire)
AMSTERDAM. June 27. The ram-
,paign for the removal of foreign Sec-
ietary Von Kuehlmann is growing in
strength. Emperor William Is willing
to dismiss him and Chancellor Von
Kc rtlingi s not disposed to retain him,
according to dispatches received hero.
In the reichstag and in the press
anger at his confession of hopeless
ness in victory for the central powers
and his display o" vacillation in his
second spee'eh In trying to avert the
consequences of his first speech is
rising.
In a violent attack on the foreign
minister in the reichstag Tuesday, Dep
uty Haase, independent socialist, says
Vorwaerts, suggested that on the re
ceipt of a certain telegram Chancellor
Von Hertling hurried to the house to
openly hand Von Kuehlmann the
"silken cord."
Deprly Haase described Von Hert
ling, Von Kuehlmann and yon Payer,
the vice chancellor ns "fig leaves to
hide the nakedness of the military
government." and asked why the real
ruler of Germany, Von Ludendorff, was
net made chancellor.

WASHINGTON, June 27. Efforts
to bring the house resolution propos
ing submission of the Susan B. Anth
ony equal suffrage amendment to the
constitution to a vote in the senate to
day failed.
' After three hours of debate and pra
liminary jockeying the resolution was
withdrawn with a promise that next
week the fight would be forced to a
conclusion. Some of its supporters,
however, expressed belief that action
might be- postponed indefinitely.
Opponents asserted that a vote to
day was being demanded because
Senator James of Kentucky, was un
able to be present and could not se
cure the customary privilege of bein
paired. Managers of the resolution
charged its opponents with filibuster
ing to prevent a, vote because, with
Senator?; Jainet iabsejit, , they lacked
votes to defeat the' resolution.

Few set speeches on the -resolution

o'clock, when the army appropriation

Senator Reed of Missouri. In the de

the suffrage leaders to arrange a nair

"the first fruits of suffrage are to set
aside courtesies and decencies of sen

nearly an hour and a half, but mostly
on the army bill.
Chairman Jones of the senate wo

DESERT GATE NOW
CLOSED AT NEEDLES
According lo word received here,
such intense heat prevails on the des
ert west of Needles, as has never
been known before. Officials of Need
les have deemed It advisable to close
the gate to anyone who is westward
bound and owing to the scores of pros
trations which have been reported by
auto tourists, stringent meas-jres have
been enforced against any one ventur
ing into the desert. 1
The situation Is considered vital
and In order to avert any repetition or
these accidents measures had to bo
adopted. Reports from Needlos state
that the temperature in the afternoon
has been been as high as 123 degrees
and even in the shade there is no
marked deference.
Many were overcome on the desert
while motoring and in one instance a
young woman succumbed shortly af'er
reaching San Bernardino. No atteiffpt
should be made to pass through the
zone where the heat is so Intense, even
at night, for fear of an accident which
might cause delay and prove serioii3,
leaving the unfortunate ones exposej
to the sun during the day without
help.
delay" would result not only indispos-1
Ing of the suffrage question but the
army and other important measures '
Senator Jones said he withdrew his 1
motion but only until after the im
portant slipply bills are passed.
Disappointment over the outcome
was indicated by friends of the resolu
tion. Mrs. Enimeline Pankhurst, the
English suffrage leader, was an in
terested spectator iu the senate gal
lery. Alice Paul, chairman of the national
woman's party, in a statement tonight,
charged President Wilson with re
sponsibility for the failure to secure a
vote. "We face this second postpone
ment only because President Wilson
failed to work with sufficient earnest
ness and determination for the amend
ment," said the statement. "Is his
support mere pretense? the patience
of American women cannot be much
longer taxed."
