PRICE FIVE CENTS
Nation Is Calm On Eve of Military Registration Day;
Plot to Transmit Information to Germany Discovered.
ss
SETS SENT
Three Msn Accused of Having
Conspired To Keep Kaiser
Informed of Uncle Sam's
Activities. '
REW YORK, June 4. Evi
dence that two complete
high powered wireless in
stallations! assembled here
from various sources, were
shipped piecemeal to Mexico,:
supposedly for use of a Ger
man spy system in this coun
try, was unearthed today in
connection with the arrest of
' three men on charges of con
spiring to send mail, contain
ing military information, sur
reptiously from the United
States to Germany through
members of Norwegian ship
crews.
It was intimated by the United
States commisioner before whom the
plotters were arraigned, that it was
through their instrumentality that ad
vance news of the impending arrival
in England of the American destroy
ers flotilla was sent to Germany be
fore it even became generally known
in this country that it sailed. Sev
eral hundred letters have been seized
and are being translated in the ex
pectation that they will open the way
to full revelation of the alleged spy
plot.
The prisoners are Harry A. Perissi
and Irving Bonaparte, both said to be
American-born, employed by a Ger
man electrical company here, and A.
E. Melchar, said to be a naturalized
citizen from Sweden. They are
charged with conspiracy to induce
members of the crewp of the steam
ships Bergenhefjord and Krisianiaf
jord, both chartered to carry regular
United States mails, to take letters
and packages from this country de
stined for Germany, in violation of
the law prohibiting tempering with
the United SUres mails.
When the three were arraigned be
fore Commissioner Hitchcock, bail
was fixed at $2,500 for Perissi and
Bonaparte, and $20,000 for Melchar.
That others are implicated and that
the men under arrest are willing to
tell all they know was indicated by
counsel for Bonaparte who said his
client was willing to help the govern
ment in every way in his power.
A -fourth man was detained pend
ing investigation of evidence con
necting him with others, particularly
in the wireless part of the alleged
plot. He is Ferdinand H. Adams, a
German citizen, employed by an elec
trical company h-"e.
May Be Court Martialed.
WASHINGTON. June 4. If three
men arrested in New York in the
mail plot case are connected by the
evidence with the forewarning which
reached Berlin regarding the sending
of American destroyers, court mar
tial is one of the possibilities facing
prisoners.
No comment on the case was forth
coming tonight from the war depart
ment. If the charges are made that
the men actually transmitted or at
tempted to transmit to Germany in
formation as to movements of the
American detsroyers. it was believed
they could be turned over to the army
for trial, and in the event of convic
tion would be condemned to death,
as the articles of war give a military
court no alternative for that sentence.

OFFICERS TO ARREST ALL VVHQ
INTERFERE WITH
All United States Attorneys and their assistants and all United
States Marshals and their deputies have received special instructions
from the Department of Justice to promptly arrest and vigorously pro
secute all violators of the Act of Congress providing for registration
on June 5th, 1917, commonly known as the Selective Conscription or
Draft law
The law requires all male persons between the ages of 21 and 30.
both inclusive, to register on Tuesday, June 5uh. 1917. It is made a
misdemeanor punishable by imprisonment for not more than one
year for any male person between the said ages to fail to register.
The law also makes it a misdemeanor with the same character of
punishment for any person who presents himself for registration to
falsely answer any of the questions propounded to him. Furthermore
the law prohibits any persor from evading registration or from aiding,
assisting, counselling or advising another to evade registration. All
of these acts are punishable by imprisonment for not more than one
year.
Special attention will be paid to those who endeavor by public or
private speech, or in any other manner, directly or indirectly, to keep,
prevent or discourage others from registering.
The law further provides that upon prosecution and conviction of
any one failing to register, he shall thereby as a matter of law become
registered and subject to selection for army service.
I hereby request all peace officers of the State. Counties and
Cities of Arizona, and all members of patriotic organizations and all
loyal citizens, to promptly report on or before registration day, if pos
sible, to the office of the United States Attorney at either Phornlx or
Tucson, any all violations of this law which may come to their notice,
and especially the names of all persons who shall declare their inten
tion not to register, cr to aid or advise others not to register.

MAXIMUM PRICE
FIXED FOR CORN
(By Review Leased Wire).
CHICAGO, June 4. Board of Trade
directors fixed a maximum price for
corn late today, as was done with
wheat several weeks ago. The price
txied was $1.65 on all contracts of
corn Tor future delivery. There was
less excitement among the brokers
than on the occasion of the similar ac
tion taken on wheat some weeks ago.
The fofllowing resolution was adopt
ed at the directors' meeting:
"Resolved, That on and after Wed
nesday, June 6, 1917. until further no
tice, members tf this board in making
contracts for the purchase or sale by
grade alone, of corn to be delivered in
store, either for immediate or future
delivery, shall not, in entering into
such contracts, exceed the price of
$1.65 per bushel. Be it further
"Resolved, That sny man trading in
violation of the foregoing shall be
guilty of a grave offense against the
good name of ine association."
Joseph P Griffin, chairman of
board of directors, said:
"In order that this action of
the
the
directors in fixing a maximum price
for all corn contracts may not be mis
interpreted. I would have it understood
that the step was taken for purely pre
ventative reasons. While it is a fact
that governments and consumers are
liberal buyers of corn for present and
future delivery, there is no present in
dication that this buying has reached
proportions that might result in un
duly enhancing values.
"It is the policy of the administra
tion at Washington to prevent the
price bf foodstuffs reaching an abnor
mally high level and the action of our
directory in fixing $1.65 as the maxi
mum for corn contracts is simply in
support of the policy of President Wil
son and his advisors."

(By Review Leased Wire).
WASHINGTON, June 4. Prohibi
tion legislation was approved by the
senate finance committee today as a
new feature of the war tax.
Prohibitive taxes upon distillation
of whiskey and other spirits for bever
age purposes with a ban upon their
importation were agreed upon by a
substantial majority of the committee.
Taxes fixed by the house on beer and
wines were left unchanged though
they have not yet been finally ap
proved. General suspension of beverage pro
duction by distilleries and use of
liquor now in bonded warehouses
probably would be the effect of the
new tax section if enacted into law.
Manufacture of alcohol for industrial
mechanical or medicinal purposes
would not be affected by this measure.
In addition to the present tax of $2
a gallon on liquor, a tax of $20 a
bushel (from $30 to 90 a gallon) upon
all grain, cereal or other foodstuffs,
used in manufacturing whiskey or
other distilled spirits for use as
beverages, was written into the bill.
Senator Simmons said the increase
would be prohibitive upon manufac
ture while the law is in effect, or dur
ing the war. Increased taxes of $3
per gallon upon molasses, syrups and
substitutes used in distillation for
beverage purposes also was agreed
upon. Permits for exportation would
be given only for war purposes upon
appl'cation by a nation a war with
Germany.
As supplementary legislation the
committee further approved an amend
ment prohibiting importation Into
this country. Porto Rico and the
Philippine Islands of distilled spirits
made from any foodstuff except for
Industrial, meuical or scientific uses.

celebrate one of the greatest
days in the history of the na-j

man between the ages of 2 1
and 30, inclusive, will register
for service in the great army

prepare for in order that the
cause of liberty and democracy
may rise and crush the menace
of plutocracy and militarism.
In accordance with the plea of the
President, the governor and city and
county officials, arrangements have
been made to make the day one that
will be long remembered as a day
given over to patriotism. Every fea
ture of the big celebration will be for
every resident of U Warren District,

a solemn promise by the people of
the district to stand by Old Glory, in
peace or in war.

STRIKE IS SETTLED
JEROME, June 4. More than two
thirds of the fifteen hundred striking
copper miners returned to work to
day and others were being put on as
fast as arrangements could be made
to resume normal operations.
The United Verde and fifteen small
mines were affected by the strike
called May 24 to enforce demands
for recognition of the union, wage In
crease and changes In working con
ditions. Acceptance of the operators' pro
posed settlement by a vote of 467 to
431. it was said, did not indicate ac
curately the position of the men gen
erally. John McBride, conciliator for
the Department of Labor, said a few
men Influenced foreigners to vote
against calling off the strike by mis
representing the terms. Some mem
bers of the Industrial Workers of the
World said the settlement was un
satisfactory to them because it
amounted, in their opinion, to recog
nition of the union, which the or
ganization opposed, although Its mem
bers voted with the union for the
strike. The recognition of the union
and certain methods of checking, de
manded by the strikers, were not in

wages, based on the Miami scale of
$5.25 a day for underground workers,
was given by the operators, alone
with recognition of an employes

not discriminate against strikers, co

Patriotic Meeting.
At one of the largest mass meetings
ever assembled in the city or Bisbee.
Doctor It. B. Von Kleinsmid, president
ofthe I'nlversity of Arizona, and
Judge Fred Sutter of this city spoke
on "Registration, Red Cross and Lib
erty Loan." Prior to the speaking,
the C. & A. band entertained the 'great
crowd with stirring patriotic airs,
' eluded with' the plea that all the peo
j pie must do their bit to bring the war
! to a successful close,
i Judge Sutter was next presented,
and his first remarks, asking the peo
' pie of America to stand by the govern
; ment in the present crisis were greei
; ed with tremendous applause.
"The present government can only
be helped and maintained by loyalty
and patriotism," he said. "No matter
what we thought of the policies of the
government before the declaration of
, war by tie United States, all past
i differences must be forgotten at this
time.
Urges Bond Puchases.
; "I do not think that the German peo
! pie as a whole would have insulted
i and attacked the American people, as
has been done," said Judge Sutter.
! "The blame lies entirely on the heads
' of the war lords and autocrats who
i control Germany."
j Judge Sutter also advised every
I one to do his or her share whether
j by fighting, subscribing to the loan
! or joining the Red Cross He conculed
! by baying that no matter whether a
1 person was a citizen of this country,
i or whether he was not as long as he
j lives here he should be loyal under
j all circumstances. Judge Sutter's re
: marks were received with vigorous
! applause.
' Mr. Ross then presented Doctor Von
! Kleinsmid.. The Doctor opened his
address by enlarging on the obliga
j tions of citizenship. "No man can be
Store
of two nations,"- he said. -"Every coun
try in the world is represented in the
United States. No matter whether
man is Scotch, French or German,
when he makes his home in this
country, he should be, and is for this
country."
U S. Must Win.
"We are a wasteful people," he con
tinued. "And there is need for con
servation, a dire need for saving."
Doctor Von Kleinsmid remarked on
how he was present in Washington,
D. C. and in the gallery of the lionise
of Representatives when both the
French delegation, headed by General
JotTre, and the English delegation,
headed by Alfred J. Balfour, were pre
sent and how, when General Joffre
spoke on the gratefulness of France
to the United States on entering the
war, the people were frantic with en
thusiasm. "Germany did not think the United
States could enter the war, on account
of cur being a commercial nation, and
our unpreparedness," he said. "We
must make Germany pay and pay
dearly for the mistake that she has
made."
The Doctor said that President Wil
son, in a conversation with John R.
Mott. the general secretary of the
Y. M. C. A's or the United States, de
clared that the three great factors in
winning the war would be the army,
the Red Cross, and the field Y. M.
C. A.
"I am looking forward to the regis
tration report of Wednesday morning,
anxiously," said Doctor Von Klein
smid. "I know that the American
young man will not fall down in this
crisis. Bl all means we should fill up
the First Arizona infantry first. Every
one must help, whether it be the
father, mother, sister or brother."
"Let's Wake Up."
"The people of the United States
will not be downed, and will not meet
defeat, except through carelessness
and indifference," he declared. "Pat
riotism demands that we find our place
in the nation, when we are needed,
abd that time is now."
The doctor said that he did not be
lieve that the people of the west un
derstood the gravity of the situation,
on account of being so far removed
from the trouble, but he said that they
would soon come to realize the terrible
thing that it meant if Germany should
win, and demanded indemnity.
"Let's wake up," he said. "England
and France, and all our allies are
about exhausted, and we must have
the men ready to do their part. Let
us not depend on Roosevelt, and his
few but have ready an army of a mil
lion men, prepared to put in the field.
Urges Co-operation.
The doctor states that the schools i
of England and France were only en
rolling one third of their normal cap
acity. He said that trained men wil!
be sorely needed after the war for re
construction work, and that this na
tion must prepare to furnish the men.
"America must conserve her belief
in the dignity and truth of civilization,
and must be the example of the entire
world as a shining light or demo
cracy," he declared. "As we stand
on the tlireshhold of the greatest crisis
that the country has ever faced, we
are not afraid, but must bend every
atom of our energies toward helping!
the great Liberty Loan, the Red Cross,
and foremost, the registration."
In closing, he remarked that the
cities that are going to house the
camps of the newly mobilized army
must clean up. both morally and phy
sically. . He said that there must not
be a repetition of the Spanish Amer
ican war, when nine men died of di
sease to one killed in battle. Doctor
Von Kleinsmid will leave this even
ing for Douglas where he will make
an address.

NATION IS CALM ON
EVE OF REGISTRATION
(Continued From Page One)
In working out details of registra
tion plans, government officials have
found state, city or county govern
ments eager to take part. As to the
success of the project, huge as it is,
officials have no doubt. The whole na
tion is at work 'on the job. It is the
people's business the business of the
individual citizens to carry it through
and they are doing it.
Men Should Be Proud.
Secretary Baker, in a statement to
night, sa id the country's young men
should rejoice for the opportunity
coming to them tomorrow to register
for a war in defense of democracy.
"The opportunity which is offered
on registration day to the young- men
of America .is unparalleled in our
history," said th eseeretary. "We are
in this war to save the early funda
mentals of political and personal lib
erty, not only for ourselves but for
future generations. Until a complete
victory is won for these principles,
there can be no holding back, and no
turning back.
"We shall need all the energy and
all the resources at our command
to be exevted, not against the Ger
man people nor with intolerance or a
personal racial character, but with
resolute determination to devote to
the success of the unselfish cause
which we are defending, all that wr
have to offer. For these young men
the day should be one of rejoicing
for the chance which comes to them,
and one of serious responsibility, be
cause in the isueyis involved the very
future of democracy."
CATHOLIC LADIES TO
DANCE AT VISTA PARK
On account of the 'heavy sale of
tickets the Catholic Ladies' dance
which was to have been given at the
City Park this evening will be staged
at Vista Park, Warren. The enter
tainment will start promptly at 8:30
o'clock.
Proceeds from the dance will go
to the support and to the completion
of St. Patrick's church. The Catholic
ladies have labored to make of the
dance a tremendous success and their
efforts promise to be crowned with
success. Refreshments, of all kinds,
will be served at the Park during the
dance.
vogue in New York, and these is
every promise that during the coming
bull market which all authorities
agree is at hand, they, in common
with the main " c opper issues, will
reach a high level.
Mr. Killick was enthusiastic over
the business outlook for the whole
country, and is confident that Bisbee
will soon feel the wave of prosperity,
which is now at hand, and which will
doubtless sweep the country.

CHICAGO GRAINS.
CHICAGO. June 4. Wheat rose
sharply today owing in the main to
tbefact that hedging sales of the
new crop have been scarce. The
market closed firm 4 to 9 net higher
with July at 213 and September at
193. Corn finished Vi off to a like
advance, oats down to 7U and pro
visions 20 to 43 cents decline.
Absence of hedging was accounted
for by reports that the ripening of
the new crop in the southwest held
to be fully 10 days late. The delay
to harvesting, was said to be offset;
by an improvement of uualitv and by
a material enlargement of yield. j
Com shorts found themselves bad-1
ly squeezed at oni time. Favorable
weather had led to free speculative j
selling and when attempts were made
to even up for tomorrow's holiday,
the market bulged about three cents
above Saturday's finish, showing a
gain in some cases of as much as
fifteen cents within a week. The
market closed with most of the ad-
ia:iee wiped out.
Seniituert as to cats was very
bearish as a result of continued
favorable crop reports.

Sometimes perhaps to "get rid"

As far as economy goes, you can soon decide.
The question is simply: does weak or erratic

because theu- technical department was "able to secure unK

That's because Zerolene is correctly refined from asphalt-
base crude by methods especially developed by the btandaro

Less wear and more power because Zerolene keeps its lubri

REGISTER TODAY!
For the first time since the civil .war the men of -the
nation, between twenty ane and thirty, inclusive,
will be called upon to register for the defense of their
country. Today will be the first step toward secur
ing the first contingent of the national ,army, which
will mean the defeat of autocracy and the further
elevation of the standard of democracy throughout
' the world.
Some apprehension is felt in many circles that
trouble will occur today. It is with considerable sat
isfaction that the people of Arizona can look about
them, on the eve of this momentuous occasion, and
feel that nothing of the kind will take place in this
fair state. There may be some slackers; there may
be some who will endeavor to avoid their bounden
duty, but in the great majority the residents of the
forty eight star, will respond en masse.
Practically every business in the Warren District
will be closed throughout today. There can be no
excuse for not regictering. There could be none if
all businesses were in full operation. In order to -eliminate
any possible excuse the merchants, manu
facturers and others have closed their doors in order
that there may be a freer and more complete regis
tration. Today will live long in the history of the United
States as another step in the line with complete
democracy; where every man bears his burden, no
matter of what description, equally with his fellow
men.
Bisbee and the Warren District, with other cities
and other states, are on trial today. Let no man
shirk his duty.
REGISTER!
HEADING INTO TROUBLE WITH THE DRAFT.
Even if the situation be permitted to develop normally
there is reason to fear disturbance over the draft, says
the Chicago Tribune. If advantage Is taken of it by
radical propagandists, anarchists, terrorists, and enemy
agents the disturbance may look like a massacre.
The cloud the size of a man's hand is revealed now,
and if it grows there will be trouble. The draft law will
be applied whether the objectors like it or not. Any one
who increases the size ofthe objection and thereby the
size of the trouble will have to be dealt with and will be
dealt with.
We should advise people to sink their personal opin
ions on this subject just now The law is in operation.
It is a just law. The principle of universal military ser
vice is as sound as the principle of general taxation. For
4 person to declare his exemption from the one is as
iolerable as for him to declare his exemption from the
other.
Both are needed to maintain the state, and the state,
Jiaving adopted them as principles, principles of equity
and fairness, must maintain them. The ordinary pro
cesses of law are sufficient to enforce the payment of
taxes. Extraordinary processes will be used to enforce
the military obligation.
Opposition to the draft will be met by rifle fire. Wo
are convinced that any preliminary gentleness in dealing
with the situation will only make the results more costly.
Men responsible for exciting foolish or selfish people to
mob resistance of conscription ought to be shot. They
not only ought to be, but are quite sure they will be.
We do not wish to put 'too much emphasis on tin
possibilities of trouble, but there are many elements of
disorder to be considered and it would be unwise for
people to ignore theni. In the civil war we had draft
riots when the cause of war was plain and the war wa
at home.
The cause of war may now be confused in the minds
of people and the war itself is far away. The people
wanted it to stay far away and they find it is coming up
to them. Our progress into it has lacked dramatic se
quence. We take a step and nothing happens. We take
another step and nothing happens. Thus wnr seems to
be safe territory. When it it fou:id not to he a revulsion
df fueling nwy sliaka this p: ic 'd natst n and out of that
r-.vilsion spring ve.v m-it-jus disorders.
Therefore the cniinn ' i t;iators is a wiw o-ie and
n..nitive measures will widely, lie verv prompt and very
tr 'ive. Mildness v.;!l nre:;;: only nialm?.
We should ad'-ise the socialists to ccusidsr mure can-
iU'ly the propaganda they say they will spread with a
new earnestness. They say that they will not deal with
Uie war except to do hat may be don? to bring it to
an end. They call it a "capitalistic war." That cheap
false phrase is maddening to certain elements who thin!;
of themselves as constantly manipulated by an embodied
something representing money they want.
To the extent that socialists promote this idea just
now they are contributing to the troubles of the state.
They are, to this extent, working with the anarchists
whose principles they do not accept.
Socialists believe in the highly organized state. An
archists in no state! Yet socialism may make nearly as
much trouble for the state as anarchy. J
The state will assert itself, and if the trouble comes;
citizens must reconcile themselves to measure which J
may be sentimentally distressnig. I
It may be unpleasant to an amiable American citizen
to be told by a soldier at a street corner that be cannot
go down a certain street and hear, down that street, a'
fusillade. We need not turn away from the unpleasant
thought It will serve as a warning now and it will pro
pare the mood for what certainly will occur If the warn
Ing be not accepted.
There are enough soldiers in the country to handle
draft riots an dthe temper of the military will not be
lenient The law which is to be enforced is just. There
would be a tolerance of great injustice if it w;re not the
law. It would be a great injustice to permit opposition
to it
Universal service is an obligation of citizenship which
leaves the citizen no power of selection. It is not his
business to say what he shall do. The men elected to
represent the citizens have said what the citizens shall
do and, with the state in danger, the citizens must do it.
The selective draft is the most effective fashion in which
the nation can operate at present and the nation intends
to operate.
Conscientious objectors had better examine their con
sciences and their objections more. Disturbers had bet
ter consider the prospects more carefully.
Trouble will be dealt with in a very unpleasant fashion
quickly, we hope.

BIG THINGS AND BIG PEOPLE.
In 1S52, four years before the Gadsden Purchase wes
made, copper was mined in the Ajo mouptains. Thirty
per cent chalcorite ore, which cropped on the surface,
was taken from the ground, freighted to San Diego and
thence shipped around the Horn to a smeltery in Europe.
Sunday, after over half a century, a giant copper pro
ducer turned out its first cathode refined copper and
added another big red metal unit to the industrial
strength of Arizona.
Hail to the New Cornelia!
Bisbee shonld feel proud of the development in the Ajo
mountains, since it was Bisbee men who superintended
the work and Bisbee capital which made the New Cor
nelia possible.
In 1911 the attention of .Captain John C. Greenway.
general manager of the Calumet and Arizona Company.
was directed to the Ajo country- H was then a veritable
desert, traversed only by the hardiest prospector and
the nomadic Papage and Yaqui. Captain Greenway was
interested, and his company, in turn, decided on action.
What Is now the ground at the New Cornelia was
churn drilled and the ore -on the property determined
The Calumet and Arizona then financed the property and
in February 1916 work on the construction of the plant;
was started. Fifteen months later we find the leaching
plant completed and successfully making refined copper
from low grade ores.
In the making of this big property, which will turn out
eighty pounds of copper a minute, or 36.000.000 pounds of;
the metal a year the company has put out $7,000,000 In
this day and time, when the government is speaking in
terms of billions, the amount may seem trivial but whenj
it is considered that many promotions are made which.
pretend to be able to make" a mine with $100,000 the.
outlay of the parent organization is viewed in a more ,
tangible light. '
To the stockholders and directors of Calumet and Art :
zona the thanks of a young state are due. A hitherto
unproductive part of a big commonwealth lias been
landed on the side of progress. To Captain Greenway.
whose untiring efforts, sound judgment and remarkable
foresight made all of this possible and an established
fact, the people owe a debt of gratitude.
Big things are done only by big people.
TAX SLACKERS.
There are many kinds of slackers. The one who tries
to dodge his military duty is only the most obvious type
of offender. There are others nearly as contemptible.
And among them Charles W. Eliot, president emeritus of
Harvard, gives special distinction to the tax dodgers.
After men, our government needs money. A denial of
funds would mean disaster as surely as would a denial
of soldiers. Tax-slacking is a sort of financial mutiny.
And ifs not merely an isidious blow at national success.
's a blow at the slacker's own character.
Tax-dodging doesn't consist only in the secret evasion
one's financial obligation to the government. It i
found just as clearly in demands for special legislation
favoring large classes of people who should properly
are the tax burdens. Says President hi lot:
If the great majority of voters who are of niiderate
narrow Incomes use their control of taxation to avoid
paying any taxes themselves, they surely will lose their
self-respect, and therewith those sturdy, indpend.-nt.
Jionest and just qualities which alone benefit free men.
their own selfish and mean action they become- moral
pauperized. The action of the American democracy mi
the income tax already shows shjus of this insidious cle
uiordlizatiou."

Flashes of the expectant audience
contentedly munching popcorn and
peanuts and drinking pink lemonade,
are shown with views of "behind the

The elephants are seen being led in
to the ring. There is big Jumbo, who
weighs just hundreds of pounds, and a
little baby Jumbo who walks just
ahead of his mother, and seemingly
very proud of posing for the movies.

How Time seasons Soldiers
and stiellows Tolsacco
The raw recruits "hayfoct" and
"strawfoot" in the awkward squad.
But they are good material. A year or
two passes. And now you see sea
soned soldiers trim erect. Time
and discipline have done their splen
did work.
Peculiarly the OWL Cigar is
much the same.
A stock of selected leaf joins the
great OWL leaf reserve the leaf
reserve which always totals $1,000,
000 in value. And quite often more.
Under the keen eyes of watch
ing experts this leaf cures and mel
lows for many months. Finally, after
more than a year, it reaches the
"peak-point" of OWL fragrance.
Time-curing has done its work.
Time-curing has blended and mel
lowed the selected OWL leaf to the
very turn of fragrance. The OWLleaf
is "ready" for your OWL Cigars.
Why don't you try an OWL Cigar
and see how really fragrant a smoke
time-curing can produce.
