Body to Prepare Program
Informal Meetings of Confer
ence Probably Will Begin
Monday With Informal
Discussion by Delegates
PARIS, Jan. 11. (By Uie Associat
ed Press.) The first "meeting of the
supreme inter-allied council since the
American delegation arrived in Paris
is expected to be held at the French
foreign office tomorrow.
This will bring together President
Yi!son and the premiers of the three
other principal powers David Lloyd
George, Georges Clemenceau and Vic
torio Orlando who will probably be
accompanied by their foreign minis
ters Balfcur. Pichon and Sonnino.
It is understood that Colonel House
will also attend with President Wilson
and Secretary Lansing as be had
served as the president's representa
tive on the council until the president
arrived here.
This supreme council is distinct
from the inter-allied conference, a9
the supreme council is confined to the
president and premiers, whereas the
inter-allied conference is made up or
the full delegations of five members
of the great powers and a lesser num
ber from other powers.
Arrange Preliminary Program.
For this reason the full American
delegation will not attend the meet
ing Sunday.
,The purpose of the meeting is to
arrange a preliminary program for
Monday when the other nations will
be represented and full delegations
will be present. The matter of rep
resentation and Monday's meeting of
the inter-allied conference have been
the subjects of informal discussion
among the various national represent
atives, but so far no official announce
ment has been made.
The arrival of the Japanese and
Chinese delegations has brought to
the front the possibility of the asser
tion by the former of the right to rep
resent the latter, and it may be that
this will be one of the questions con
sidered tomorrow.
inter-Aallied Conference.
It is expected that the inter-allied
conference will assemble early Mon
day, though the exact time and dura
tion of the sessions have not yet
been finally fixed. Sessions, more or
less formal, will likely last several
days, with M. Clempuceau as tempo-
rary presiding officer, pending the ar-j
rival of belated delegations and the
launching of the conference in its full
membership.
When that stage is reached Presi
dent Poincare will attend for the pur-
pose of delivering the welcome to ,
the delegates, and Georges Clemen-

tinuation of government control, or
early relinquishment of the roads to

promptly enacts remedial legislation.
"Mr.-McAdoo's policies are my poli

through the existing railroad organiza
tions," he telegraphed today to region
al directors, Immediately upon an
nouncement of his appointment, which
wa9 made by President Wilson by

also declared for a "square deal for

Before the senate interstate com

WASHINGTON, Jan. ll.-How un

was put into practical use during the
war was disclosed today by navy de
partment officials, giving to the pub
lic another of Its secrets, carefully
guarded so long as It might be of
value to the enemy. Government of
ficials regard this development, origin
ated in private research by James H.
Rogers, a scientist of Hiattsville, Md.,
as one of the war's major scientific
advances ot the kind. In practical
use, the new system so far is employ

Make Campaign Issue
The idea of combining the several
hundred private lines into a few fed
eral concerns has been considered by
Mr. Hines but he said the questions
relating to the subject were so nu
merous and perplexing that it was con
fusing to try even to list them. He
believes, however, that It will be an
advantage to have the railroad prob
lem discussed during the next presi-1
dent la 1 campaign basing this on the I
feeling that sentiment of the nation is
not sufficiently crystallzed to permit
congress to enact legislation that i
would be satisfactory. I
The director general said be favored j
discussion and testing of federal con-
trol over a period that would give .
needed Information to the country, aft
er which congress would be able to
act with greater safety. While he ad-
vocated immediate return of the rail-
roads to their owners if the extension
is not granted, he pointed to possible
labor difficulties and financial prob-i
lems of the roads
as arguments
against this plan.

ARCHANGEL, Jan. 11. (By the
Associated Press.) The latest in
formation obtained by agents of the
allied intelligence department and
from bolshevik prisoners has devel
oped a number of facts about the
personnel and organization of the
bolshevik! on the north Russian
front. This Information Indicates that
the allied and American troops are
opposed by a force, which, while not
of high morale Is at least fairly well
organized. It Is officered, not by Ger
mans as at the commencement of op
erations, but for the main part, by!
former Russian and Lettish officers
of considerable training.
The bolshevlkl have as general offi
cers and battalion and company lead
ers, many officers of the former Rus
sian emperor's army who were either
forced to serve on pain of death or
Imprisonment, or who are serving foi
high pay. The bolsheviki do not trust
these men and to nearly every one is
attached a "commissioner" whose
principal duty seems to be to spy on
the officer and report him for pun
ishment if he shows signs of waver
ing. Gittls Opposes Americans.
Opposing the Americana ana allies
on this front is the bolsheviki sixth,
army with general headquarters at
Vologda, whose commander-in-chief is
General Gittls, formerly commander
of one of the Lettish brigades In the
old Russian army. His chief of staff
is former General Parskl, once com
mander of the old Russian twelfth
army corps, who now is military ad
viser to the bolshevik government.
The sixth army is In turn divided

WESTBURY, N. Y., Jan. 11. Jac
ques Lebaudy, known as "Emperor of
the Sahara," was shot and killed by
his wife as he entered her home,
"Phoenix Lodge," here' tonight.
Madame Lebaudy, who Is popular in
the fashionable Long Island colony,
fainted after the shooting. News of
the tragedy was conveyed to Madame
Lebaudy's attorney by her 18 year old
daughter, Jacqueline, who notified
Sheriff Seaman, of Nassau county,
Sheriff Seaman at once established a
guard over Madame Lebaudy.
According to Sheriff Seaman, the
eccentric millionaire, who ' was a son
of the late Max Lebaudy, the "Sugar
king" of France, had been separated
from his wife for several months.
j Puts Guard About Home
! About a week ago. Sheriff Seaman
said, Lebaudy visited Phoenix Lodge
I and created a scene. Madam Lebaudy
then employed a guard at the home,

His body, pierced by a bullet, was
found at the foot of the grand stair
case of the house. A black grip lay
beside the body.
The home, where the shooting oc
curred, is within 1000 feet of "The
Box" where Mrs. Bianca de Saulles
shot and killed her husband. John
Longer de Saulles, on August 31, 1917.
Lebaudy, whose escapades had fill
ed columns in New York newspapers,
made for himself the title of "Emper
or of the Sahara," in 1903, shortly
after his father died, leaving him an
estate, the value of which was esti
mated at 112,000.000.
Establishes Kingdom .
Conceiving the idea of establishing
a great maritime city, and a "king
dom" on the coast of Africa, Lebaudy
sailed from, France on his yacht "Fras
quita." accompanied by three follow
ers. After landing and taking formal
possession of the shore under the title
of Jacques I. emperor of the Sahara,
he returned to Europe and collected
a colony of nearly 600 persons whom
he transported to bis kingdom.
Difficulties with the French, Span
ish and Swiss governments followed,
and Lebaudy hauled down his flag,
three bees on a field of purple, and
returned to France. A French man-of-war
later took off some of his col
onists, who had been left on the Afri
can coast.
In 1904 Lebaudy issued a statement
from Prussels "renouncing his crown"
but a year later it was reported he
sacrificed a payment of 1,000.000
francs due him, from a sugar trans
action because the check was not
i made out to "Jacques 1, Emperor of
Sahara."

OBJECT OF LEAGUE.
LONDON, Jan. 11 The main ob
ject of a league of nations, which the
peace congress should create, is to
prevent future wars, if possible,
through arbitration and conciliation.
Viscount Bryce. former BritiKh ambas
sador to the United Slates, declared
today. While the congress may not
be able to fix all details, it should
nettle upon principle and appoint com
mittees to arrange the Cetails. he de
clared. In a statement to the Asso
ciated Press, Lord Bryce said:
Enforce Joint Will
"The creation of some commission
or league of nations, disinterested in
their aims, trusting one another and
strong enough to enforce their joint
will, is a fundamental necessity in or
der to carry out the settlement of Eu
rope and the east, which is the task
of the conference, and to determine
the future of the German colonies.
"The main object of this league, be
cause providing for the welfare of the
regions liberated from Turkish tyranny
and safeguarding the new free states
which are to arise, will be to prevent
the outbreak of future wars. To do
this some method of settling disputes
other than war must be provided and
that, we are all agreed, must be found
in the methods of arbitration and con
ciliation. These methods must be j
studied and organizations for under-!
taking them must be provided. I

MAY EXTEND ARMISTICE.
PARIS, Jan. .11. (Ivas.) It is
probable that new conditions for an
extension of the armistice will be
offered Germany at the meeting to
morrow of the supreme war council,
according to the Matin.
The Figaro says the first discussion
of the peace conference will involve
the general question of territorial
agreements. Immediately afterward
it will deal with a settlement of ter
ritorial questions pertaining to the
eastern border of France, the French
representatives setting forth, their
views on the recovery by formal claim
of Alsace-Lorraine and the modus
vivendi they will recommend for the
left bank of the Rhine. The news
paper concludes:
"It is believed that within a maxi
mum of two and one-half months, con
sequently in March, the plenipotenti
aries will have settled in' all the de
tails of the preliminaries of peace
and the conference will have fin
ished its work. The congress will
have only to work out a settled pro
ject." .
PRESIDENTS QUARTERS.
PARIS, Jan. 11 (By the Associat
ed Press.) The Paris "white house"
has gotten down to a working basis,
which now resembles the organization
of the executive mansion at Washing
ton. It is a matter of remark that a
groat deal of the formalities and trim
legs which the president found when
he came to the Murat palace has
gradually disappeared. As he Is there
as a guest, the president has been
reluctant to change the household ar
rangements, but he considered it
necessary to dispense with some of
the formalities usual to French no
bility. Discard Liveries.
When President Wilson arrived
there was a formidable array of- foot
men dressed in flaming red knee
breeches, with stockings and long
tailed coats. All these rancy liveries
have been put away; the palace at
tendants, now going about in the
customary civilian dress of the whits
house employes ' In Washington.
The president Is using motor cars
assigned by the army and driven by
men in khaki. The only real sugges
tion of military - is the guard about
the palace, much In the same manner
as the cordons of troops about the
white house. .

fHv Review lra Wire)
WASHINGTON, Jan. 11. Great
Britain lt was stated authoritatively
today, has never suggested to the
United States proposals for a truce In
Russia and consequent admission of
delegates of the Russian soviet gov
ernment to the peace conference as
stated today, by Stephen Plchon, the
French foreign minister.
Officials recalled that Great Britain
was the first nation to declare against j

llgerenta and to neutrals, asking that
the bolshevlki be regarded as enemies
of all governments. Later it was
stated that replies received by thei
state department indicated that the
civilized nations of the world were ar
rayed definitely against the bolshevlki.
Will Assist Russia
The United States repeatedly has
made It plain that It would aid in the
rehabilitation of Russia and the re
storation of a government of law and
order In that country as far as com
patible with its policy of non-interference.
It has furnished substantial
aid to the governments at Omsk, Arch
angel and in the Don Cossack region.
Arms, ammunitions, food, clothing
and medical stores have been furn
ished when the governments to which
they were sent proved their good in
tentions and their desire for a restor
ation of law and order. In every
case lt was made plain to the people
of Russia, however, that the United
States was friendly, but that they
themselves had to throw off the yoke
of bolshevisra.
Concerning the Russian question,
the French delegates are said to be
In unalterable opposition to the ac
ceptance of any suggestions from bol
shevlki circles. In the absence of
Russian official delegates, the French
will favor consulting all the prominent
Russians possible.

Important task of stabilizing labor

"Industrial dislocation and warfare,"
which It has been feared might result
from unemployment during the period

of stoppage of war work.
An appeal to President Wilson to

Senator Ptellnghuysen or New Jersey,

ranged for 1920, and for succeeding
years
Chief of the Innovations which is
planned by the treasury will be the is
suance of long-term securities into
which war savings stamps and certifi
cates may be converted. DetaiU of
the securities are now being worked
out. In addition, the treasury depart
ment is now working on plans to
issue war savings certificates of $100
and $1000 denominations to make it
unnecessary for purchasers ,ot these
amounts and their multiples to buy
adhesive stamps.
One of the chief objectionable fea
tures of war savings securities as
they have, existed in the past, has
been (n connection with their value
as colateral for loans. Owners of cer
tificates heretofore have taken them
to the postoffice and cashed them, if a
small sum were needed urgently. Sel
dom have they been taken to banks
and deposited as security for a small
loan.
Under the new plan however, this
objectionable feature of war savings
stamps will be eliminated. As fast
as stamps and certificates collect, the
owner may convert them into the long
term securities which the treasury
will offer. In turn, these long-term
securities, like Liberty bonds, will of
fer suitable and unsurpassed colateral
for loans at banks. Trafficing and
dickering in stamps and certificates
will be ended and safer investments
assured.
Thrift has been drilled into many
Americans in the past year. The na
tion has learned to save, to put pen
nies, nickles and dimes away for
purchase of war savings securities.
The government does not intend that
this lesson of national thrift shall
have been in vain, and to this end
the treasury department is exerting
every influence to make attractive
the war savings securities.
Thrift is commendable. Thrift is
an attribute which has made nations
independent. It is a habit which has
made men rich. Americans in the
past have been spendthrifts.
Now, the government comes for
ward first with lessons in thrift and
finally with an invitation urging the
public, with attractive offers, to con
tinue thrift, to make thrift perpetual,
a part of the national habit, and tra
dition. If one-half those who prac
ticed the lesson through the war have
profited In experience, the govern
ment's efforts will not be without
avail.
Stealing Thunder
Republicans in their annual love
fest at Chicago, have started out in
their characteristic attitude to rob
the domocratic party of its thunder,
for the next national campaign.
Speeches, addresses, harangues and
documents have had their share in the
republican plan, but the height of
thunder stealing came on Friday,
when leaders of the-party began boom
ing General John J. Pershing for pres
ident in 1920.
This idea, of running General Pcrsh
Ins for president, is not new and did
not originate with the republican con
vention. At the first of the year one
cf the large American magazines car
ried a poster bearing the general's
photograph and the inscription "For
President, 192u." Kvery man and wo
man who lakes an in-live interest in
politic has thought seriously of a
Pershing boom. Tradition of the
United States offers political hooks
en which to Iihiik a Pershing presi
dential hat. And the soldier of the
United Slate will swing a gigantic
vote to (lie hero of the war
I "or thee reasons it is ualural that
i any convention should consider the J
possibilities of General Pershing as a
candidate for president. In spite of
the fact that his home Is in Wyom
ing and that he Is a western man
from a sparcely populated district, he
will make excellent presidential tim
ber. The republicans know these
facts; and knowing them, they seize
an opportunity to launch a republi
can torch-light procession featuring
the American hero.
It Is here that the height of thun
der stealing must be recorded, for.
General Pershing is a democrat The
public learns little of the politics ot
army officers, except when, as In the
case of General Leonard Wood, poli
tics Is blamed for some misfortune.
Perforce, officers must hide party af
filiations under military capes, to es
cane some of what General Wood
learned.
This too, the republicans knew, and
they were aware that the public, not
knowing General Pershing's afflcla-
tlons, would welcome him as a re
publican possibly, if his name were
mentioned at the right moment By
a fortunate combination of circum
stances, time and convention, oppor
tunity was presented. And, its good
politics to grasp at opportunity.
General Pershing with army and
civilian sentiment backing him, can
probably have the nomination on
either ticket if he chooses, and with
out great stretching of points he could
run as a republican. His father in law
was a staunch republican of the old
school, but the boy Pershing .grew up
to rote' the democratic ticket. Be
cause of past affiliations, the demo
crats are entitled to his name and
candidacy, and it Is highly probable
that should he accept the nomination
it will be from the hands of the party
with which he has cast his vote.
Leave it to the republicans to start
propaganda and steal thunder. They
are already considering. General
Pershing as a possible candidate; but
is it possible that they have over
looked considering him as a possible
candidate against the republican nom
inee? Knowing republicans, you know the
answer.
Lloyd George on Top
The expected has happened in Brit
ish politics. Only, as one might say,
it has exceeded expectations. Lloyd
George's coalition government has
been returned to power by tremendous
majorities. Parties are virtually wiped
out. There is little partisianship in
what remains. The fusion group that
fought and won the war has its num
bers and prestige vastly increased.
It is a great victory for broad pat
riotism ver narrow partisianship. It
is a great vindication of the compro
mise policies that made it possible to
throw the full force of the British em
pire into the scale of war. It is also
a great personal triumph for the pre
mier. The long and short of it is that.
David Lloyd George, is today stronger
than ever before. He is the British
government and can go to the peace
conference with a clear mandate from
the British people to wTite tuo peace
terms according to his known princi
ples and policies.
This means that the British junk
ers are beaten. Lloyd George is a
democrat of democrats. Unless he is
greatly changed he will certainly not
make an Imperialistic, autocratic
peace, for the benefit of only the
wealthy and powerful. He will not
tolerate old-fashioned, secret, crooked
diplomacy. He will do his level best
to make the world, and every part of
it, safe for democracy, and clinch the
victory by giving the allied nations
what they have been fighting for.

RATE INCREASE IS
GRANTED. B. L CO.
AFTER HEARING
Following a hearing held yesterday
afternoon at 2:30 o'clock in the city
hall, the state corporation commission
granted, the petition of the Bisbee Im
provement company that it be granted
the right to increase its minimum rate
on large quantities of power con
sumed. The hearing was held before
Commissioners Amos A. Betts and D.
F. Johnson, who came here yesterday
morning for the purpose of holding
It, and left last night for their head
quarters in Phoenix.
The facts as set forth in the petition
for the increased rate was that sev
eral years ago a rate of two and one
half cents per kilowat had been grant
ed to consumers of more than 6UU0
kilowats of power per month. A dis
count of ' 10 per cent for cash has
beati allowed consumers of between
boot) and 10,000 kilowats per month,
w hile consumers of more than io.ooo
kilowats were entitled to a discount
of 15 per cent for cash. The largest
factor in the manufacture of electrical
power is fuel oil and during the last
two years the increased cost of oil
f. o. b. Bisbee has been 93 per cent.
The petition requested that an In
crease of the minimum rate from two
and one-half to three and one-fourth
cents be allowed and the system ot
discounts be done away with, entirely.
In support1 cf this petition a letter
signed by every one of the consumers
affected was received by the coaimis
sion, acknowledging that they were
receiving power under the existing
rate for less than it cost to produce
it.
The hearing yesterday was Lricf,
verbal testimony to support the writ
ten statements being introduced. The
commissioners recognized the justice
of the petition and granted the in
crease requested. ,
In rendering their decision, the com
missioners made it plain that the new
rates apply only to the consumers
mentioned. There will be lio increase
in the rates for electric light or pow
er to the general public or to business
people using less than 6000 kilowats
ot power per month.
This was the first case docketed by
the corporation commission in the last
two months, Mr. Betts said, because
of the Influenza epidemic over the
state.
This was Mr. Johnson's maiden case
in his home county of Cochise. Prior
to going to Phoenix as state treasurer
in the first state administration, he
was a resident of Douglas, having
been employed by the Phelps Dodge
company as a bookkeeper and latterly
having been city clerk of Douglas. He
also is a iormer newspaperman. He
has many friends in this county and
was kept quite busy yesteroay after
the hearing greeting them.
Johnson took office as a member of
i he commission January 6. In com
menting upon his accession to office
he said yesterday that he felt under
obligations to r.o particular element
for his nomination at tne primary and
intended to make his administration
one of a square deal, througaout, for
every person, class or element with
whom his duties brought him into of
ficial contact.

Campbell is expected to arrive in the
city at noon today and will .be at the

SHIP TURNED BACK TO
U. S. WITH BISBEE MAN
That William W. Stapleton, former
ly a miner at the Czar shaft of the
Coppc r Queen branch of the Phelps
Lodge company, did not get in touch
with the Hun is not to be ascribed to
any lack of desire on his part. The
armistice came too soon, by just a
shade. Stapleton, who has returned
to tl:c district and will be hack on his
old job in the immediate future, said
his organization had set sail for Eu
rope.' Midway across the Atlantic,
a message flashing the news of the
signing of the armistice an J ordering

ADMISSION:
E CULTURE IS
LATE BOWIE PLAN
That grape culture will be one of
the large industries of the northern
part of Cochise county, and that farm
ing and its allied industries are fast
coming into their own throughout
these districts, is the statement ol
William Delbridge, of Bisbee, who has
recently returned from a tour of the
Bowie-Willcox-Sain Simon districts of
the county. Grape culture on a large
scale, declares Mr. Delbridge, is al
ready practically assured.
In promotion of this Industry, de
clares Mr. Delbridge. a tract of 2000
acres of valley land near Bowie has
been cleared and is now being placed
on the market. It is the plan of the
promoters to prepare the land fully
before inducing settlers to take up
their tracts. Tracts will be ten acres
in size, and the entire 2000 acres will
I be supplied with irrigation, water.
lights and telephone connections irom
a central plant. Schools, churches,
parks and amusement features are
also being arranged.
The site of the tract which has been
selected for grape culture is four
miles from Bowie on the main line
of the Southern Pacific railroad. When
the plans are worked out. it is antici
pated that 200 families will have been
interested in the tract, and. declares,
Mr. Delbridge, several families from!
California have already declared their
intention of settling on the tract.
In connection with the plans for
grape culture near Bowie, Mr. Del
bridge declares that there are yet
many acres of land available in the
San Simon district and other parts of
the north end of the county, some of
which have artesian water. Plans are
being completed, declares Mr. Del
bridge, for complete advertising of
the district and for interesting more
farmers in the possibilities of the
county's fertile lands and valleys.

Miller Gains 20 Pounds
Taking Tanlac Wife
Regains Health Too
"No one could see the wonderful
changes that has taken place in me
during the past few weeks and doubt
Tanlac being a great medicine," said
W. H Miller, while in a Bartell drug
stoie, recently. Mr. Miller superin
tends the general repair work of the
Puget Sound Dredge tt Bridge com
pany and lives at 25 Sea view avenue,
Seattle. Wash.
"I bave picked up 20 pounds," he
continued, "and I feel like I would be
doing anybody, who is suffering like I
was. a good turn by putting them on
to Tanlac. I have had so much trou
ble with my stomach for the past ten
years that I could hardly eat or sleep.
I had no appetite at all and what I did
eat would ferment, causing gas, bloat
ing and misery. I was constantly
belching up my food sour and undi
gested, and my condition kept getting
worse in spite of all I could do.
"I finally got me some Tanlac and
soon found it was helping me. So I
stuck to it until now it has complete
ly cleared up my trouble. My appetite
is splendid and my stoaiach is in such
a good condition that I can eat just
anything I want and all I want without
suffering a particle afterwards, and
I simply sleep like a log every night.
I had gone down to 150 pounds and I
now weigh 170, which is a gain of
20 pounds.
"My wile, whose condition was just
about as bad as mine in every way, is
now taking Tanlac, too, and it is doing
the same good work for her it did for
me. I couldn't ask for better results
than we have gotten from Tanlac and
I don't hesitate to recommend it to
everybody."

Out of the valley of death to re

Alcock was a member of the "Con

the first days of the great world war
were known, and after fighting for
nearly H months and being wounJed
twice, was so badly passed at the bat

Recently he tame to Arizona to re

spent the winter of "14-'15 the
trenches were the worst I ever saw.
Just three feet of parapet and that

In these trendies we froze and at

During the four months spent at Mes

the ridge, but without success.

famous Hill 60 was blown up by our

Lots of water we drank came from

several months.
"The war has dealt hardly with
my family. I lost all my cousins on
my father's side except one. He was
stationed in Ireland because he was
too old to go to the French front. My
sister, who will be remembered as
Cecil Alcock by many Bisbee friends,
lost her husband. Captain Goff. He
was wounded in France, afterward
dying in a hospital.
"Our Bisbee friends will be glad
to know that both my father and
mother. Mr. and Mrs. James A. Al

and as happy as could be expected j
utder the circumstances.
.Mr. Alcock carried with him a war
has in which he had numerous souve
nir of the experiences he had passed
through in France and afterward in
England. Most highly prized was an
inviU'tion to ' Buckingham palace,
where he, in company with other
wounded soldiers, was presented to
the king, queen and other members
of the royal family of Great Britain,
including the Princess Royal, the
Princess Maud and others, all of
whom had autographed the invitatloa
for him.
"It seems Impossible to me that I
am alive today, I saw so many of
my comrades mowed down around
me," said Mr. Alcock in completing
his description of his experiences.
He has written a book on his ex

GRAIN MARKET.
CHICAGO, Jan. 11. Reports that
Great Britain and France haJ can
celled big contracts for food supplies I
in the United States did much today'
to emphaslza bearish sentiment re la-1
tire to corn. The market closed
heavy, 2Vfec to 4c net lower, with
January $1.40 to 1.40 and May
$1.32 to 11.32,.
Oats lost c to lc.
In provisions the outcome ranged
from 87c decline to an advance of 2c.
Weakness in the corn market
hinged chiefly on statements by an
official of the food administration
that all possible steps were being
taken to reduce the high cost of liv
ing, and tbat Argentine and United
States prices of corn should be
brought nearer together. The selling
impulse due to this talk was greatly
intensified later by the news of the
action of Great Britain and France
regarding food contracts. In addi
tion, a rumor that the Argentine strike
had been declared off was circulated,
and the prospect aphis' appeared to be
for a broadening out' of the crop
movement. About the only important
demand came from , shorts who were
collecting profits.
Oats weakened with corn. Les
sened inquiry from eastern shippers
was apparent.
Provisions were depressed by the
downward tendency of grain and hogs.
The holding up of British orders for
meats was also a bearish factor.

Magnates of the Three Eye league
will be well represented at the special

cure early action for the coming
year and the preliminary steps will
likely be taken at the, Chicago confer

spective members and a strong and
compact circuit is in prospect.
L ecmington, Peoria, Decatur, Spring-re:-;,

ii i...:y be found desirable to take in
one or two cities of Indiana, former
members of the Central league.
The opinion appears to be general
that the Three Eyes should reorganize

that something definite will develop
from the Chicago conference.

A.A.U. Organizes
For Coming Year
(By Review Leased Wire)
NEW YORK, Jan. 11. Samuel J.
Dallas, president of the Amateur Ath
letic Union of the United States yes
terday announced the foil list of com
mittees appointed by him to look after
A. A. U. affairs for the ensuing year.
They include finance, championship,
legislature, record, registration, bas
ketball, gymnastic, playground and
recreation and a special committee fcr
re-districting the various associations
of the A. A. U. .
In making the announcement. Presi
dent Dallas said that he looked for
an unusually successful.- yea in ath
letics and expected these committees
to be very active. The redisricting
committee is one committee in par
ticular that will hive considerable
work to do this year. This commit
tee Is expected to formulate plans for
new associations to be made up from
terirtory taken from some of the as
sociations which are considered too
large at the present time to accomp
lish good results. It is felt that great
er interest in amateur athletics in th
United States can be secured by mak
ing two or more new district associ
ations from the territory of several of
the larger associations now having
more territory than they can proper
ly manage.
In discussing this matter yesterday,
Mr. Dallas said, "The Metropolitan as
sociation at the present time com
prises the states of New York, Con
necticut and New Jersey north of
Trenton. The officials of the associa
tion feel that there is room at least
for -three and possibly four new dis
trict associations in the present Met

a Western New York association.
"Cleveland and Columbus In Ohio
are really too far from the Allegheny
Mountain association headquarters In
Pitsburgh, to obtain the best results,
and it might be advisable to develop
a new association around these two
important cities. Portions of Ohio,
Indiana and Illinois could be linked
together with perhaps Cincinnati or
Indianapolis as the headquarters.
"Several new associations might be
organized in the present territory of
the Western Association, which at
present covers an area of many thou
sand square miles. The same might
be said of the Southern, Inter-Mountain,
Rocky Mauntain and the three
Pacific coast associations.
"Amateur athletics can be controll

tory manner with smaller territories

present plan is,' I think, a step in the
right direction, and will greatly bene

Curtailment cf Production Starts With New Year and Leading
Properties Already Are Producing at About 80 per Cent
Capacity; Steps to Prevent Over Supply- Expected to
Prevent Shutdowns of High-Cost Small Properties
WASHINGTON, Jan. 11. The production of copper in the United States-
In 191S was slightly larger than in 1917,
estimates collected by B. S. Butler,
Tcy. At an average price of about 24.75 cents a pound, t.he output of 191S
bad a value of $473,000,000, as against values of JalO.000,000 for 1917 ana
$190,000,000 for 1913.
The production of blister ard LaV:e copper from domestic ores was
1,910.000.000 pounds In 191S, against l.SS6,000,COO pounds in 1917 .and
1,224,000,000 pounds in 1913.
The supply of refinrd copper (electrolytic. Lake, casting and pig) from
primary sources, domestic and foreign, for 1918 is estimated at 2.450,000,000
pounds, compared with 2,302.000,000 pounds for 1917 and 1,615,000,000 pounds
for 1913.
The imports of copper In all forms for the first 11 months of 1918
amounted to 5C5.SG? COO pounds, against 556,000,000 pounds for the 12
months of 1917.
The exports of pigs, ingots, bars, plates, sheets, rods, wire, and like cop
per products for the first 11 months of 1913. as determined by the same
bureau amounted to 692.759.000 pounds; the exports for the 12 months of
1917 were 1,12C,082,000 pounds.
At the beginning of 1918 about 114.000,000 pounds of refined copper
was in stock in the United States. Adding tbis quantity to the refinery
output of the year shows that the total available supply of refined copper
was about 2,564.000,000 pounds. Subtracting from this total the exports for
the first months and the estimated exports for the last month shows, on
the assumption that there was no change in stocks, that the supply avail
able for domestic consumption in 1918 was considerably more than the
1,315,000,000 pounds available in 1917.
Curtailment of copper production has started and leading properties
are producing at the rate or about 70 per cent of capacity In the opinion
of the best posted authorities. At the beginning of December the mines
were producing at about 80 per cent and further curtailments will be made
in the new year. While reticent to discuss the matter, copper. men ad
mit that Uie curtailment was started with a view to keeping down the
supplies of the metal during the present period of inactivity on the part of
consumers and many companies have stopped work on their low grade ore
bodies.
Some interests point out that it is better to sell only 50 per cent of the
capacity of the properties at a small profit than to produce at or near 100
per cent and make sales at a !os. There have been no shutdowns of smaller
high cost properties as reported, and the steps for curtailment already
taken are believed to eliminate such action. Had the properties operated
at capacity and buyers continued their policy of holding the stocks of copper
in the early months of 1919 it would have become topheavy and material
declines in prices for the metal misht have resulted. Good export orders
In the next 12 months are regarded as a certainty and when foreign
contracts are placed domestic consumers will follow, so that the outlook is
said to be encouraging over a long period.
A representative of one of the selling agencies In discussing the cur
tailment of production, says:
"Although none of the officials of copper companies has made a state
ment about reduced output, the December production totals will record de
creases, according to tJ;e information which has come to us. Curtailment
of production at this time is logical in view of the prevailing conditions.
"Whereas there would have been no difficulty in keeping the properties
operating at the rate they did in the summer, the action taken by the
managements will work out more satisfactory in view of the fact that the
demand at present is limited and is likely to continue so for perhaps a
month or more.
"Stocks of refined copper at present are not abnormally large. In
fact, they are smaller than on many occasions in years prior to the war in
Europe. But if the copper companies had continued capacity operations
the surplus would have been increased materially and such a situation
would have worked cut. to the disadvantage of producers as well as con
sumers. "We know that there are large contracts coming from Europe during
the coming twelve months, and there w-Ul be no difficulty to increase the
production in thi3 country if conditions warrant such a ntep. However, at j
present it arpears to me to be the better policy to sell only perhaps 50 '
per cent of the country's capacity at a small profit rather than have pro
duction at capRcity and make some sales at a loss.
"The dpmand for copper is coming, although for a time there Is likely
to be a tendency to hesitate on the part of domestic buyers. When the
foreign buying starts, however, the domestic users will come Into the
market. It has been the history of the copper industry since its inception
that consumers in this country duricg periods of uncertainty have hesitated
about placing their orders, and as a result the foreign users were enabled
to get the metal at a low figure.
It ia not probable that this will be repeated in the future, mainly be
cause of the Copper Export association. Incorporated, which will handle
practically all the export business of the leading producers, and is in a
position to fix a price and hold for that figure. The competition which
foreign buyer? could bring about in the past has been eliminated, and the
position of the copper producers in this country at present is better than
It has been at any time in the past, except during the war when there was
not enough of the metal to go around."
Reports have been published that a number of the smaller-high-cost
copper producers will shut down their properties shortly after the first
of the new year. In well informed quarters It is stated, however, that
the poliry of curtailment now in force, and which might, be increased, will
eliminate such a stpp. as it will enable the smaller companies to sell
their reduced production at a profit, although the margin will be smaller
than it wf? when copper was selling at 26c per pound.
Closing dov n of t opper mines always has been an expensive propo
sition. Tumps must be kopt working to keep down the water, and when
the market p ta to a point where resumption of work Is desirable, a con
siderable amount of money must be spent before production is resumed.
In addition the difficulty of getting the proper workers also must be counted-

B1NGHAMT0N HAS
BECOME PRODUCER
n'C PAST YEAR
MAYER, Ariz., Jan. 11. A very in
teresting folder has been mailed to
the stockholders of the Arizona Iling
hampton Copper company, by its pres
ident, W. H. Reynolds, setting forth
the results of a recent meeting of the
company's directors and including a
report on the company's mine by
Horace V. Winchell, a very well
known mining engineer and geologi.-st
who made, recently, an exhaustive ex
amination of all of the holdings of
the company.
Kor more than two years this com
pany has been operating a copper
mine six miles northeast of Haver,
there being an cil flotation mill at
the mine, with a daily capacity of
about 150 tons. The report shows
that over 90.000 tons f ore have been
milled and 922 tons of high grade
shipped to the smelter which shows
a total production of close to 5,000,000
pounds of copper which represents a
recovery of nearly 3 per cent. It has
been profitable to treat ore as low
grade as 2l,4 per cent. The ore con
tains small values in silver.
According to Mr. Winchell's report,
there are in reserve about lOO.'iOO tons
of ore assaying 3 per cent copper, or
better, and about 150.000 tons of a
lower grade, all above the 600-foot
level. The trine has been developed
on the ore zone for a distance of 1I"0
feet. On the strength of the recom
mendations of this engineer, the com
pany is now putting down a new 3
corapartment shaft a short distance
from the old one which will reach a
depth of 750 feet by June 1. It is
then expected that an entirely new
mill will be built with a capacity of
303 or more tons, using the sale flow
sheet as used in the present mill.
The oil flotation process has been
found to be especial!;." well adapted
to this class of clialcopyritc copper
ore.
As to the future or th- mine, this
geologist states: "The oxidized zone
extends to the depth of about 60 feet.
Beneath this there is a very shallow
zone of secondary enrichment and be
low that the ore is primary. The
geological character and probahle
genesis of these ores is such as to
indicate Indefinite downward exten
sion and there is every reason to be
lieve that future developments to

of even larr ore bodies than tiiosp

Alaska Gold Has
Held Own in 1918
SEATTLE, Wash., Jan. 11.
Alaska's gold fields, the first big dis
covery cf which 20 year3 ago flashed
IYia northern territory to the front as
a mineral producer and lured hun
dreds of Ftampeders north, gives
every promise of increased production
tn 1919, according to a review of
Alaska mining in 191S, issued here by
S. 1.. McPherson, secretary of the
Alaska bureau of the Seattle Cham
ber of Commerce.
Gold, coal, copper, silver and other
mines of Alaska were hit hard by the
war. "There is no truth in the re
port, however, that no mining was
done in Alaska in 191S" Mr. MiPher
pon said. "Despite the shortage' of
labor an-.l transportation, the high cost
of materials and supplies, mining de
velopment ia Alaska during 191S
showed material progress in the open
in;; t.' many new properties and the
enlargement of plants and equipment."
Copper miners were busy during
the year, according to the review.
The Kennecott Copper corporation
started driving a tunnel to connect the
world-famous Bonanza mine with the
Mother Lode workings. During the
year the corporation employed about
550 men and although paying the
highest wages in the history of lode
mii ing in Alaska has operated short
hand u due to the shortage of labor.
In the Prince William Sound district,
the report said, coper mines were
seriously handicapped by the lack of
transportation facilities. Despite this
handicap the Grandby company built
a tramway 2S,3t-.0 feet long the long
est in Alaska from the Midas mine
to tidewater on Valdez bay and
equipped the mine for a larger output.
Two Alaska gold districts, the Wil
low creek in the Susitna and the To
lovann near Fairbanks produced about
tL'OH.POO worth cf j.old during the year,
the review said. Circle City, Alaska's
old reliable placer camp, had one of
its most prosperous seasons. Rich
pay v.a.t reported struck on the Tolat
liii river in the Kuskokwim country,
on Nb.on Cork and on WetketcUum
creek. In the famous Nome country
on the Seward peninsula, shortage of
water was felt by the operators. Dime
creek., a new camp, wis one of the
most active mining districts on the
peninsula in 191$.
In the Alaska coal country much
wt.ik wa dune dunlin- t'ie year, the
review st.ued. The Alaska enqlneer
commission let contracts for the de
livery of ('.MM tons of Nc:K!"a 'il
from properties recently opened on
the liri" of the Seward F:tir!:a:'. Ss gov
ernment railroad. "This marks the
betiniiini;." Mr. McPher-stui said, "of
real development in Alaska's vast In
terior etiul fields."

m YEAR DINNER
If MINE REVIVES
m
TUCSON'. Ariz., Jan. 11. That it is
still possible to revive the thrilling
era of early Arizona mining camp life
that time now known it. the com
mon parlance as "the goti old days"
was effectively demonstrated at Sil
verbell on New Years' eve when a
celebration true to the form of the
wild and woolly west was given by
Julius Kmttschnitt. jr., general man
ager of the southwestern division of
the American Smelting & Refining
company.
The entire entertainment was in the
manner of a complete surprise to the
out-of-town guests, whose introduction
to the party was to say the least, excit
ing and unique.
Through Darkness on "Speeder"
Throuiih the darkness they were
whirled from one "switchback" to an
other through the hills on the com
pany "speeder," a high powered mo
tor which shoots along the railroad
track at a rate of speed sufficient to
startle the nerves of a Barney Old
field and with the roar of an airplane
climbing altitudes. To further ac
centuate the effect, Ihe "speeder's"
lights were dimmed and the guests
were hurled through the blackuess at
a terrific velocity, their terrified ex
clamations being lost in the deafening
noise of the motor. .
After a quarter or an hour of this
stimulating and nerve-racking sport,
the speeder slowed down before the
Union shaft of the A. S. & R. com
pany's properties, where a huge spot
light directed the way to a mine cage
in Which a drop to the 200 foot levol
fairly took away the breath remaining
to the agitated guests, a number of
whom had never before been in a
mine. "
Tread Mazes by Lantern Light
At the 2n0 foot level, the guests
were met by a serious faced Mexican
miner who led the way with his mine
lantern through intricate mazes of
darkness, occasionally lighted by tall
candles set In natural grottos of an
other spotlight and to bursts of palpi
tating music which swelled out in the
warm, underground air to the strains
of "Keep Your Head Down, Frltzie
Hoy."
"Receiving-Line' 340 Feet Below
And there 340 feet beneath the
earth was the "Receiving Lino" head
ed by Mr. Edward Thornton, the gen
ial superintendent o? the A. S. & R.
properties at Silverbcll, and hi
ili.irniing wife, together with a score
of other Silverhellltes who welcomed

party.

BONUS SYSTEM OFFERS MINERS
OPPORTUNITY TO BUILD HOMES
WITHOUT FINANCIAL TROUBLES
Payment of Second Annual Sums Calls to Attention Close
Analogy Between Bonus and Recently Inaugurated Third
Addition to Warren; Eight Years Will Build and Pay for
$2000 Residence Under Offer Made Company Employes
No Curtailment of Forces in District; Records Broken on
Sacramento Hill; C. & C. Shaft Enlarged to 1000-Foot
Level and Station Is Forming; Ten Million Expended in
State During Past Year in Improvement to Mine Properties
In the recent payment of the second annual bonus to hundreds of em
ployes of the mining companies of the district, a situation was brought to
light showing the clcse analogy between the annual bonus and the recently
inaugurated third addition to Warren, which is intended exclusively for em
ployes of the Phelps Dodge and C. & A. companies, and more particularly
for the men working underground. The annual bonus which is intended as a
reward for faithful service, not only will take care of the interest on the
average investment in house and lot in the addition, but will in the course
of a -period of years pay the principal.
In the view of the fathers of the new- addition, who are anxious ti
help the men help themselves to acquire a home, designed and built along
the most modern lines, and of the best materials, the average investment
should be about J2000 to 12500. Were It to be larger, they argue, too great
a draft upon the resources and income of the purchaser would be involved.
Instead of creating a feeling of satisfaction in acquirement of ultimate Inde
pendence, there would be liklihood of creating a feeling that "someone had
a mortgage" on the purchasers. While It is understood no arbitrary limit
has been set. yet those applying for and being granted loans are advised not
to involve themselves too heavily.
One Hundred Monthly Payments
Taking $2000 as the aver.re to be expended, the loan would be mad
bearing interest at 6 per cent per annum, but to be repaid In 100 monthly
payments.
Anyone possessing mathematical intelligence could see in a moment
that with each monthly pavment. not only interest but principle would de
crease. However, taking $120. which is the interest on $2000 at per cent
as the basic figure and allowing that to run to that figure throughout the
period of the loan, it can be appreciated that the fi.-st year's bonus for em
ployes would come within $20 of paying the interest. The second year's
bonus would lark but $10 and the third year would cover that amount.
As the sura of the bonus increases by $10 each year until the fifteenth
year when the total of $250 would be received as the annual bonus, and the
employe would be retired with a pension, it would be easy to calculate the
result. At the end of the eighth year, the bonus would have brought the
employe a total of $1160. At the end of twelve years, his bonus receipts
would have amounted to $19r0 and at the end of fifteen years it would have
reached the respectable total of $2230 or more than his home would have
cost him.
Not Pushing Building Project
The home1 would be paid for in a fractcior. more than eight years, each
monthly payment marking a decrease in the principal, as well as a' steady
decrease in the amount of interest payable.
While about eighteen houses either have been completed or are under
construction in the new addition, no effort is being made to push the pro
ject at the present time. During the war period materials and labor were
quite high, but there is no reason why this condition should obtain after the
close of the war. l'y waiting a few months, material can be bought much
more elkeaply than now, it is believed. In fact, every Indication points to
material prices having passed the peak and being on the downgrade at the
present time.
Plans Being Prepared
Grading, the laying of sewer and water pipes, installation of electric
light poles and changes in the telephone system to provide adequate accommo
dation for the hundreds of empolyes of the two big companies who are ex
pected to want to take advantage of this premier chance, either are under
way or contemplated for the immediate future. The physical surroundings
of the addition will be in keeping with its every other feature, insofar as
convenience for the home makers is concerned.
In the houses themselves, all modern conveniences possible to be in
stalled for the money involved, and as many "built in" pieces of furniture
carrying an appeal to the housewife as can be devised, will be features.
No Curtailment of Forces
The Copper Queen branch of the Phelps Dodge corporation here, has
not begun to discharge any of its employes, notwithstanding1 rumors to that
effect which were current on the street during the week just ended.
T.'ie present policy of the company in employing workmen is to hire only
returning soldiers, or men who previously worked here for at least two years
and within the last two years.
Break Records on Sacramento Hill
All records in stripping in the steam shovel operation on Sacramento
hill were broken Wednesday, January S. when 433 carloads of rock were
loaded in the 16 hour day. This mounted to more than seven thousand yards
of material or an average of a trainload of four cars every nine minutes.
The best previous record day was when 6000 yards of rock was loaded. i
December was the best month up to date in results at Sacramento hill.
During that period approximately 140,314 cubic yards of material wss moved.
The work was carried on every day in the month, with the exception of
Christmas. The daily average moved was about 4S0O yards.
At the rate cf loading attained Wednesday, which, however, wss ex
ceptional, the record for January would 'be 1S6.000 yards. It is not ex
pected to reach that figure, but the total probably will be considerably in
excess of December.
Thursday's record for an 8-hour day was the best yet. as an average of
a trainload of four cars loaded every five minutes was maintained.
C. & C. Shaft Enlarged
The work of enlarging the C. & C. shaft of the Phelps Dodge Corpora
tion from the surface to the 1000 foot level lias been completed and work
has been started on cuttinn laree pumping stations on the SOO-foot level.
Within a short time everything will be in readiness to continue sinking the
shaft to the 1S00 foot level.
. The new bead frame and hoist have been installed, the latter having
sufficient capacity to carry work to the desired depth, or even lower, should
that prove desirable.
Mine operations in the Phelps Dodge properties in the Warren district
during the last eleven days have gone smoothly, the average amount of work
being done. However, since the necessity for removing vast quantities for
smelting. In order to turn out copper for the al'ies. has been removed, repair
work and a small amount cf development have been undertaken.

Women Demonstrate
"Carry on" Spirit
No better example of the "carry
on" spirit shown by all the indefatig
able women wlio have given their
thought and time to war work than
a little episode that occurred a week
ago at the country club. Unusually
cold, pipes frozen and no convenient
source of water did not daunt the
hostesses, Mrs. C. S. Thompson nd
Mrs. C. H. Hunt. That was just a
dififculty to be overcome by & car
loaded down with cans and bucket
of water (sad to relate water splashed
dresses and shoes a little at each
bump) a sack of coal and fire logs
to make the great fire-place the more
cheerful and not forgetting the tea
and cakes. This should not discour
age future hostesses, but rather, be an
example of "surmounting insurmount
able difficulties," as one of the host
esses expressed It.

State Survey Nurse
to Work in Dietrlct
The Anti-Tuberculosis society of
the district has secured the services
of the state survey nurse, Mrs. John J.
Lane for a month. Her program a
mappd out. Is to work, along educa
tional lines with the school children.
A certain portion of the money raised
from the sale of the Red Cross seals
last year is to be used by the local
branch of the society in Its work her.
The apportionment of four hundred
and forty-eight dollars from the fund
will be partly used at this time.
Showing a membership of 11.670. a
circulation for the year of 24.638 vol
umes and an average circulation of
S6.9 volumes for the 284 business days,
the annual report of the Copper Queen
library gives a striking illustration of
the amount of reading done in the
Warren district. The report has just
been compiled and issued by C. O.
Vail, librarian, and it shows in addi
tion to work regularly conducted 450
books and a large number of maga
zines have been collected and dis
tributed to soldiers.
The report discloses that for 76 days
during the latter part of the year the
institution was closed because of
quarantine regulations, greatly reduc
ing the year's attendance and circula
tion. In spite of this, an estimated
reading room attendance for the year
of 85.475 is reported, while the aver
age dally attendance is reported at
293. The report shows that only 52
book were lost during the year, and
that ot this number 19 were paid for.
Following U the report in detail:
Total number of volumes In
the library 8,809
Circulation for the year 24,683
Circulation per volume 2.8
Average dally circulation, 284

Average daily attendance, 291
days 293
Tb.e library was closed by quaran
tine 13 days In February and 63 days
In October, November and December,
a total of 76 days. This makes a de
cided cut in the year's circulation as
well as reading room attendance and
all other activities ot the library. The
library has been active in war work
during the year. About 450 books have
been collected for the soldiers, also a
large number of magazines. The bul
letin boards have been in use for war
bulletins and a large number ot food
conservation booklets have been giv
en out. The patrons of the smoking
and game room have given up that
room for the use of the Red Cross.
Of Interest to Women
(Continued from P Two)
ducting large buniness operations,
without feeling a lack of knowledge
du to previous inexperience. It grew,
from a small beginning nntil ., now
there is a fund of $25,000, which per
manently endows a lectureship chair.
Scholarships in the class amounting
to $10,000 also have been established.
Some of the women members have
been exceptionally wealthy, andtbese
have been in many cases particularly
keen to learn.
Although last season was not one
of great ittivity In various branches
of sport in which women took part,
yet' eood showing waa made by
those who did continue their activi
ties .along those lines. Among the
champions of the year are Miss Molla
Bjurstedt, In tennis; Mrs. L- G. VogeL
amateur trapshooter; Miss Clare Hay
wood, in billiards; Miss Clare CallJ
gan Finney, swimmer; Mm. Ad Top
parwein, professional trapshooter, and
Miss Eleanor Sears, who is claimed
to be the foremost woman athlete in
the country.
Those famous words of Solomon
or some other more modern wise man,
"Go west, young man," may be heed
ed most advantageously by young wo
men these days. The progressive west
is the ideal place for the women who
woul4 "do something," either in poli
tic or business.
Woman fairly shines in the politics
of our west. One of the latest bits
of news of which the suffrsgets (bay
well be proud comes from West-
port, Oregon. Clackamas county.
where Weiport is located, claims the
youngest woman county treasurer in
the United States and local political
sharps say she is the only woman to
hold such a position.

BONUS SYSTEM OFFERS MINERS

WITHOUT FINANCIAL TROUBLES
(Continued
tarding influences, new equipment with value of more than $10,000,000 has
been brought into mining service in Arizona during this year.
The largest single item in the total, rep-resents the new United Verde Ex
tension smelter in the Verde district. A large amount of money was spent
in the same district in bringing in higher capacity and greater- efficiency
at the United Verde smelter, work that continues, in progress with splen
did results attending,
Douglas smelters of the Phelps
expenditures for betterments that have much increased efficiency of plant
operation. At Miami, completion was made pC important addition (to
Miami Copper company power plant, and at the Inspiration there was con
siderable expenditure for mine equipment betterments, as there was also
at the Old Dominion and other properties in the Globe district. These ex
penditures made larger production of copper immediately available, at the
same time providing permanent gains in plant efficiency.
New Milling Operation
The' year added two new concentrators of large tonnage to the number
cperating in the state, while several smaller plants were erected and put
in operation, inclusive of those on the World's Fair and Flux mines in the
Patagonia district. One great new plant was brought under construction,
that of Phelps-Dodge in the Warren district, designed to treat Sacramento
hill steam shovel ores. The two large plants put in operation were those
of Ray Hercules and Shattuck copper companies. Both have come into
the delivery of excellent results, following the period of minor alterations
and readjustment common to breaking in of new equipment.
Steel and machinery for the Phelps-Dodge mill are arriving on the
site, where grading is far along and some construction under way, but
speed originally planned for this work and preparation of Sacramento hill
for production has been slowed down by reason of federal requests and re
quisitions of materials from time to time.
Conservation Advanced
Progress made in improvements by both smelting and milling enter
prises in the state in 191S represent long stride in conservation. All the
expenditures have meant greater recovery of values, coupled in the main
with lesser requirements for man power and the making available of lower
grade 'ores, points upon which the mines, mills and smelters were com
pelled to concentrate during the war period. Experimental work in ail
divisions is unceasing and there is much that will be brought into practice
within the next few years that will have advantage for the mining industry
generally. With these advances there is proportionate gain to ore .reserves,
because of the making available of lower grades than previously amenable
to profitable treatment.
Information was received yesterday from Clifton of the drawing of the
fires of the Shannon Copper company smelter. The mines of the company
started closing down last Saturday and have now finished the shutting of all
openings. Tbe smelter fires went out last night.
The announcement is made officially that the Shannon company has
been operated at a loss during the past six months. This was due in part
to increased freight rates of 25 per cent, increased wages and a stagnant
market. Like other operating companies, the Shannon has on hand a large
accumulation of copper stocks for which as yet there is no market. General
Manager Bennie stated that the operations would be suspended temporarily,
and that upon the future copper situation would depend a resumption of
the company's work in the district.
Closing of the Shannon leaves out of employment in the neighborhood
of 600 men, for whom there is no immediate work at Clifton or Morenci.
This number of idle will be increased by reductions in working forces
which it is anticipated the Arizona Copper company at Clifton and the
Phelps Dodge property at Morenci will be obliged to make under the cir
cumstances now surrounding the metal market, it is not believed, however,
that either the A. C. or the P. D. will have to entirely close down.
With the men out at Globe because of sabotage, practiced at the Old
Dominion, resulting in the breakage of machinery and compulsory closing
down of the entire property, more than 1500 copper mine workers are today
out of employment in two camps in the state, with probably a total of 500
more dropped from all the other camps during the last two weeks of gradual
slowing down. .li1Ll
Dispatches from Butte yesterday states that the Anaconda Copper com
pany had put in effect a 25 per cent reduction in working forces. The an
nouncement of the curtailment was accompanied by the statement that it
might at a later date be necessary to raise the reduction to a full 50 per cent
of all employes, and that the latter should take steps in preparation for un
employment. Later dispatches from Butte said that the reduction in workVng forces
would apply generally to mines in that district and did not coue unex
pectedly. There have been a number of men laid off in the last two weeks,
and although there was no announcement, and it is now evident no fixed
policy in association with these earlier curtailments, the reductions carried
with them the conviction that it was only a question of time until a material
and uniform grading down of working forces would occur.
From all the information available from Butte, the Anaconda policy was
adopted on the initiative of that company alone and as a matter of neces
sity in the face of a huge copper surplus, a falling market and the require
ment of immense sums of money to carry production along without income
from metal sales.
While the Anaconda moved alone in the initial steps, other Montana
properties have promptly followed in its footsteps and it is considered that
like policy will be adopted by the large producers in which Anaconda is a
heavy stockholder. Inspiration Copper company and Greene Cananea are
two of these.

The British government has report

can producers are about 35,000 tons,
a decrease from the figure of October

that the invisible supply in this coun
try is large. Stocks of zinc ore are
superfluous in the Joplin district and

which quutatiou has siuce then been
maintained, was manifestly an arbi-
trary matter, for American and Mexi-j
can producers could, and would, hav
undersold that price sharply if they
had been able to arrange with the
steamship companies for carriage of
the metal, which Uiey could not do.
The talk that there has been about
maintaining prices, large orders in
prospect, etc., has been a sort of cam
ouflage of a disagreeable situation.
The matter that has been most in the
minds of the producers has been the
orderly liquidation of governmental
stocks. In the early days following
the armistice some of them resented
the cancellation of orders and in an
obtuse way though, that they were
accomplishing something helpful when
they obtained rescindment of cancel
lations and could continue to put
metal into tire hands of the govern
ment. It was soon seen, however,
that the accumulation and holding of
large stocks by the government would
"be a menace to the market, and the
present thought, economically sound,
is to see that such stocks are dis
tributed as soon as possible, with the
minimum of disturbance. The plans
that are being urged are based on the
idea of a regular disposition spread
over a period of a year, say, the dis
tribution to be managed pro rata by
the producers in connection with the
sale of their new product.
It will be best to defer discussion of
the conditions that have produced the
present situation until the statistics
of production in 191S, and other sta
tistics, are available. It looks, how
ever, as u me worm s output oi un
will show only a small increase, if
any, as compared with 1917. while the
total for copper and lead are all hut
certain to show a decrease. Zinc will
surely show a decrease. Thus, the
producing of these metals was not
overdone. On the other hand, the
curtailment of "non-essential con
sumption" was probably carried tco
far.

E BIG BOG COPPER
HAS
GOOD
FUTURE
Fo'iowme is a partial report on the
property of the Big Bug Mining com
pany by O. K. Ferguson, M. E., who
is thoroughly familiar with conditions
pertaining to mining in the Yavapai
schist belt. Local stockholders may
b; i.il-.'iested in knowing that condi
tions at the mine are encouraging as
depth is being attained, and those at
the mine are looking forward to the
reaching of commercial ore bodies in
the near future. The appearance of
considerable oxide and sulphide at
the present depth of about 70 feet,
running well in copper values, with
some gold and silver values strength
en the supposition that the Big Bug
Copper company will enter the pro
ducing class. -
Summary of report by C. E. Fergu
son, consulting engineer, follows:
The report has for its basis an ex
amination of the holdings of tlie Big
l'.U4 company by the author in com
pany with Dan lwis and A. E. Rice.
The holdings of the Big Bug Copper
company are on the east side of Cop
per mountains in the Agua Fria min
ing district, about 20 miles south of
erome and about five miles east of
the town of Mayer.
Among the proven properties in the
same schist belt may be mentioned
the Jerome mines, the Arizona Bing-
bampton. tiie Blue Bell and De Sota
cf the Arizona Consolidated, the Hen
rietta and Butternut of the Calahan
interests, the Kay Copper and nu
merous others in different stages of
development. The immediate sec
tions embraced by Copper Mountain
and South Copper Mountain comprise
one of the oldest mining localities in
Arizona, and has been worked in a
desultory manner for over 35 years
What is sail to be the oldest smelter
in the state is located on the Agua
Fria river a short distance from the
holdings of the Big Bug. This crude
plant was erected to trwit the rich
surface ores exposed on Cupper moun
tain. A location notice on South Cop
per mountain, which is perfectly
nugible at present, is dated January
13, 1JS3, and as.?eits that Jacob Mul
ler, Sam Foram and Chris Anderson
located ihis property at that early
date. T'lis locution embraced a por
tion of the Big Hug Copper company
ho'dingj and proved that this ground
was deemed worthy of location by the
old-time prospectors, who were obliged
to confine their attention, to high
grade deposits. With the advance of
the times and the introduction of
modern metallurgical methods many
deposits then considered worthy are
now being worked at a profit. The
holdings of the Bia Bug Copper com
pany consist of 19 claims. The pres
ent directorate is Frank Thornton,
Carl K uib, vice-president; A. E. Rice,
secretary and treasurer; Uri Embody
anl M. M. Stoddard, geologists.
The holdings of the Big Bug Cop
per company are located very nearly
in the geographic c enter of a wide belt
of mineralized schist extending from
Jerome on the north to the iiradshaw
mountains on the south. This schist,
which is the basel rock of' the dis
Irict, is, according to Rickard. geologi
cal agent, quoting this authority
further. It is composed of volcanic
tuffs and tlows (metamorphosed) to
gether with elastic sediments, which
in this district are both argeiiaceous
(clayey) and silicious. Into these
consolidated oceanic sediments a
batholith are masse of intrusive igne
'ous rock was pushed. The batholith
was granite. From it tongues and
dikes penetrated the sediments which
by metamorphisej became schist.
The marginal phase of the granite
was diorite. This was intruded into
the schist so freely as to constitute
a large portion of its bulk. Into this
rock there penetrated copper bearing
solutions forming lines of bodies of
copper ores at the contact of the
schist and diorite.
The evidences of a wide spread of
mineralization are abundant on the
surface of tlie Big Bug Copper com
pany property and tuunifest them
selves in iron and copper stained cop
per, and a pitted or honeycombed
structure due to the oxidation and
leaching sulphide minerals. At a
number of places there are attractive
showings of carbonated ore on the
turlaee. In general, as far as an ex
perience.! miner can observe on the
surface indications, the conditions for
ore deposition on the Big Bug prop
erty are entirely similar as on other
producing properties in the schist
belt. In the 50-foot shaft where sink
ing is now being done the showing is
especially good, considering the shal
low depth. Stringers of high grade
oxides and carbonites have been
picked up and continue to come in
showing increased strength at depth.
Although the zone is as yet one of
strong oxidation ami leaching some
primary sulphides have already been
encountered which would encourage
the expectation of finding sulphide
ores at a very reasonable depth. Pos
sibly either the first 200 or 3M0 feet.
A iiantity of scrub timber on the
property furnishes fue l for camp pur
poses. The power line of the Arizona
Power company' passes near the
property and plenty of electric power
is thus available.

The shaft has reached a depth of
about 75 feet and is to be sunk to
the 30'Moot level.
Another very promising company is
the Little Egypt, which is developing
a number of claims almost within the
city limits of Mayer. A tunnel is be
ing driven from the creek side toward
an old shaft. Sufficient ore Is being
taken out of the tunnel work to pay
working expenses. A steam hoist has
been installed at the old shaft which
will be sunk to the Goo-foot level.
U". D. Malioney of Jerome has taken
a new lease of lite on the Western
Copper company which is developing
the old Pultun mine, lying between
the Binghaiiipton and the Big Bug
prpeities. A shaft is to be sunk on
the east side of the property.
Ore has been encountered in the
shaft of the Kay nine at the 600 level.

developments. Work has been com
menced on the north shaft which is
20'0 feet from the main shaft. At
this place an ore body of considerable
tize has been opened up on the 70
foot level.
The Kay mine, located at the south
ern eiki of Black canyon, is now shar
ing its notoriety with the Orizaba, an
old mine located about eight miles
southeast of the Kay on an ther belt
of copper. It has been owned for
some time by J. K. Truman of Phoe
nix who developed it to the lOii-foot
level. It has recently been taken over
by N. L. Amster of Boston, who has
organized the Orizaba Development
company. A very complete mine
equipment lias been installed. On the
100-toot level, a body of ore has been
cut through that will average better
than 4 per cent copper across a face
34 feet wide. It is believed to be one
of the big copper mines of the state.

' VERDE SQUAW MAY

BELIEVE BOOSTERS
JEROME. Ariz., Jan. 11. Feverish
activity prevails at the Verde Suuaw
these days, for indications in the
i
: 8liy round of shots may disclose high-
. , k ,.,.,.
This crosscut has already proved
that the Verde Squaw- is an immense
low-grade mine. There is every rea
son to believe that only a little more
work will prove it is a high-grade
mine as well.
The crosscut has already passed
through 50 feet of schist, quartz and
porphyry mineralized with chalcopy
rite and black copper sulphide. At
least 20 feet of the 50 is good concen
trating ore. In fact it could be sorted
and shipped at a profit were the Clark-dale-to-Mesa,
railroad, the survey for
which runs right by the Verde Squuw,
completed.
J. M. Mahoney. W. R. Hughes and
John Cougin. who have bad years of
practical experience in the L'mted
Verde mine, visited -the Verde Squaw
a few days ago and advised that a
drift be run to the west on the best
part of the mineralized belt mention
ed above. Their belief, based on ob
servations at the V. V. is that the
crosscut has merely passed through
the lower end of a big ore body. The
! depth, they gay. is ample, though
there is no doubt that the ore is much
richer a few hundred feet deeper.
Their advice will probably be follow
ed within a few days.
For the present, however, the
crosscut is being pushed ahead with
all possible speed. It seems th-it ev
ery round of shots opens better indi
cations. Several watercourses have
been intersected and yesterday the
face entered what is believed to be
the downward extension of an im
mense iron bldwout that outcrops
above the Boulder ledge. The forma
tion is mainly quartz and it is red
with iron oxide. Some blac k sulphide
also appears and the formation looks
so good for silver that samples are
being assayed today especially for
their silver content.
Aside from the 5o-foot mineralized
area, the crosscut has passed through
two narrower zones on whic h drifting
is amply justified. The Verde Squaw
company is now embarrassed with a
multiplicity of places to work; each
one promises great riches in short or
der. i lie pian ior me present is to coi.
tinue the crosscut through the blow-
out and then if no high grade is found
to drift westward in the most promis
ing place. Every mining man w ho has
inspected the recent development at
the Scm-iw savs now- that ii i a
cinch" that the biK strike is not far!
away. Few think that it will be
necessary to sink any deeper, though
the management realizes that this is a
possibility and is prepared to lace it.

CURTAILMENT BEGINS

TUCSON. Ariz., Jan. 11. A coa
siderable number of lueii are ex
pected to be thrown out of employ,

through reduction of forces attending

in the state.
That several of the larger mines
will make curtailment is now coming
into evidence. The reduction of forces
begun with the opening of the mouth,

MANGANESE MINERS
ASK FEDERAL RELIEF
At the netting of the manganese
producers recently in Washington res
olutions were passed, representing the
opinion of delegates from 22 states,
that the spirit and intent of the min
erals control act should be carried
out as a matter of justice. The sco
re tary of the interior was asked to
render a final decision as to what
might be done, and in response to a
committee appointed to ascertain his
views he explained that he felt that
further legislation was necessary to
give him full warrant to act under the
changed conditions. He suggested
that the minerals act be amended so
that it might be applied for the liqui
dation of losses incurred by the pro
ducers of the war minerals.
It is a fact that millions of dollar
have been spent by patriotic men in
this country in the erection of plants
for the production of potash and ln
developing other mineral resources,
trusting in tjie faith and honor of the
United States government, and that
under no circumstances would they
have spent a dollar on these enter
prises in the face of the foreign com
petition which would have prevented
suc-h industries being developed
profitably. They were urged and per
suaded by many government agencies,
including the department of the In
terior, to tise strenuous efforts to pro
vide these esseutials for the nation,
and it was universally understood that
they would be protected by the war
minerals bill that was then pending.
How can the administration explain
its shortcoming if this obligation is
not frankly and honestly met?
America should be made industrial
ly independent. The collapse of these
industries, now that they have been
c ailed into being, would exert a dis
couraging influence upon the people.
It is necessary that they should be
recompensed for the money they have
lost, but back of that lies a patriotic
effort for the national welfare that
should meet with evidence of appre
ciation, and the only way to do this
is to sustain the industries. It was
stated at the meeting by Mr. Lord of
the department of labor that a test
of national strength is the ability to
meet any emergency, through, co
operative effort, and that these re
sponses by the mining people of the
country should not be neglected by
the government. The industries were
entitled to a chance to do their part
for the future development of the
country, and the government was in
duty bound to see that they had that
I chance. When the resources ot
i America bad been shown, in any in-
stance, to be inadequate, it was time
to see about importations to make
good the deficiency. That applies to
any industry. We do not want state
socialism, but protection to the pro-
due live power of the country is not
I socialism: it is the protection to op-
portunity for private effort in order
to make ourselves self-sustaining. It
might seem, in a narrow view of self
interest, to some of the larger indus
tries that they were being benefited
by having cheap foreign raw materials
accessible, but in the end they were
preventing the growth of the country"
and of other industries that would
make a combined demand that would
more than offset the advantage of a
little reduction in the first cost of a
portion of th?ir supplies.
As one means for insuring a balance
of protection and encouragement of
the related industries Mr. Lord in
sisted that it was as important that
there should be unity of action among
the owners of the mines as among
the employes. Organization of the
metal industries for mutual help would
react advantageously upon every
phase of the work. It would inspire
confidence among the workers and
facilitate cooperation for the highest
industrial euds; it would terminal
that kind of competition that makes
the operators tbe easy victims of their
own system through the effort to grab
the market away from others. In this
system are the elements of self-destruction
that create panics and pros
tration of business. A sane protec
tive policy can be developed only by
association of the interests that con
stitute tbe commercial strongLh of
the country, and such association
should have power to direct and regu
late, and not merely to pass resolu
tions that depend upon the initiative
of some one outside to make them
effectlv e.
While steps are being taken to se
cure an amendment to the minerals
control act in accordance with the
expressed desire of Se-cretary Lane,
this, if passed, woulj result only in
reimbursing the miners for their out
lay, it would have no effect upon the
contintiar.i o of operations. It would
leave us whir; we were before the
outbreak of the war.
In 1917 the; domestic; product was
only about one-sixth of the total con
sumption of mangauese. This year it
had grown to one-third, and next, year
it would come close to supplying our
total requirements. During the first
six months of this year, according to
a communication from the United
State's geologk'al survey, the output
of this country was 13t.5.4 tons of
manganese ore. containing about 35
per cent of the metal, and ore of that
give!" was being shipped in October
a" the rate of L'S.Oon tons monthly, or
:::t,'ieo tons per ear. Manufacturers

ENGINEERS OF VERDE
RETURN FROM SERVICE
Practically all the United Verde
engineers who obtained leave of ab
sence to go to war will be ack on
the job within a few days. The lat
est to return is Chief Engineer Clar
ence V. Hopkins. Tom Macleod will
be back Sunday and Superintendent
H. DeWitt Smith is due to arrive with
his family on Monday.
Engineer Hopkins received notlri
cation to report at Washington a few
days after the armistice was signed.
His commisison as captain was the
last issued to any civilian. He ex
pected to go into training at Camp
Humphrey, Virginia, and then assist
in the rehabilitation of France, but
by the time he arrived at the capital
Uncle Sam had decided to train no
more engineers. Therefore Hopkins
was given his discharge in time ror
him to attend the grand naval review
in New York. That spectacle, he
says, compensated him for the trip.
Macleod was in training a month
or two at Camp Humphrey but he
has also been discharged and is on
his way back to Jerome.
In the final days of the war Super
intendent Smith was notified to re
port at Dayton, Ohio, for training to
fit him for a high position jn the avia
tion service. Before he arrived there
he was notified that the boches had
been licked without his assistance so
he went on to New Jersey with Mrs.
Smith and their children and has since
been visiting relatives.
