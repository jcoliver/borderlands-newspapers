PEACE CONFERENCE
BRISTOL, Dec. 1 1 (By the
Associated Press). The -war
bill of the allies against Ger
many 'is 24,000,000,000
pounds, according to the prime
minister, David Lloyd George,
who presented this and other
interesting facts before a large
gathering here today. The
cost of the war to Great Brit
ain was eight billion pounds.
Before the war the esti
mated wealth of Germany,
said the premier, was between
15,000,000,000 and 20,000.
000,000 pounds sterling, so if
the whole wealth of Germany
were taken, there would not
be enough to pay the account.
Therefore, he "used the words :
"Germany should pay to the
utmost limit of her capacity."
When the prime minister was ad
dressing an overflow meeting:, he said
Great Britain would be guilty of a
great folly if she gave up her navy.
A voice interrupted: "Then watch
"Wilson!"
The premier replied:
'Well. I hope to meet him in a fort
night, I will tell him what you say."
"Wherever the request comes from,
we are not going to give up the pro
tection of the navy, so far as Great
Britain is concerned."

BY NO MEANS ENDED
WARNS GENERAL BLUE
URGES PEOPLE OF NATION TO
TAKE ALL POSSIBLE PRECAU
TIONS AGAINST DISEASE WHICH
AGAIN IS SPRINGING UP ALL
OVER THE COUNTRY
WASHINGTON, Dec. 11. Warning
to the country that the influenza epi
demic is by bo means ended and that
all possible precautions against the
disease should be taken, was issued
tonight by Surgeon General Blue of
the public health service.
Reports received by the service
show a recrudescence of the disease
practically from one end of the coun
try to the other and in bis statement
Dr. Blue advised the closing of the
public schools on the first sign of the
reappearance of the epidemic. He said
the disease apparently now tended to
occur more frequently among school
children.
"Our main reliance," Dr. Blue said,
"must still be the observance of pre
cautions by the individual person. He
should cover up his coughs and
sneezes and insist that others do the
same."
Information reaching the public
health service shows that in California
increases in the number of cases are
reported from San Francisco and
many other cities.
In Iowa there has been a marked
Increase in the number of cases. The
situation continues serious in Nebraska.

WASHINGTON, Dec. 11. Abandonment cf nineteen construction pro

MWOO PROPOSES
Oil RAILROADS FOR NEXT FIVE YEARS

i
Declares This to Be Only One
in 1 Al t' ' '
and Practical Alternative Ul
Situation
WASHINGTON', Dec. 11. Ex
tension of the period of govern
ment control of railroads for five
years, until January 1, 1924, was
recommended to congress today
by Director General McAdoo.
Advantages of this, Mr. McAdoo
said, are that it would take the
railroad question out of politics
for the present, give time for
earning out an extensive pro
gram of experiments and provide
opportunity for a fair test of uni
fied control to indicate the perma
nent solution of the railroad
problem.
"The president has given me per
mission to say that this conclusion
accords with bis own view of the
matter," Mr. McAdoo said in conclud
ing -a letter addressed to Senator
Smith of South Carolina, ,and Rep
resentative Sims, chairmen, respec
tively, of the senate and house inter
state commerce committees.
Perils of Present.
Mr. McAdoo explained that to con
tinue government operation for 21
; months after formal declaration of
! peace under present conditions, would
i mean disruption of morale among em
j ployes and officers, and could not
enable the government to go ahead
with improvements and purchase of
! equipment. Another alternative, the
'. prompt return of the railroads to
j private control, will permit a return
i to the old wasteful competition "and
i be prejudicial both to the public, and
to the roads themselves, and the diffi
culty of obtaining immediate legisla
tion providing a permanent solution
is apparent," said Mr. McAdoo's let
ter. Only Wise Alternative.
"There is one, and to my mind only
one, practical and wise alternative,"
Mr. McAdoo continued, "and that is
to extend the period of federal con
trol from the one year and nine
months provided by the present law
to five years or until the first day
of January, 1924. This extension
would take the railroad out of poli
tics for a reasonable period. It would
give composure to railroad officials
and employes. It would admit of the
preparation and carrying out of a
comprehensive program of improve
ments of the railroads and their
terminal facilities which would Im
mensely increase the efficiency of the
transportation machine. It would put
back of the. railroads the credit of
the United States during the five
year period so that the financing of
these Improvements could be suc
cessfully carried out. It would offer
the necessary opportunity under
proper conditions to test the value of
unified control and the experience
thus gained would of itself indicate
the permanent solution of the rail
road problem.

LONDON, Dec. 11. (British wireless
Bervice .) During the war 13 spies
were shot in the Tower of London, ac
cording to the report now current.
1 Carl Hans Lody, alias Charles A. Ing-

Omaha, Neb., was the first to be exe

death, but both were reprieved, the
sentences being commuted to long

named Rowlands. Rowlands was exe

Journeys between London and Rosyth,
Scotland, and obtained information re

is declared, never reached Germany.
The other woman spy was Eva de

NATION'S CROPS EXCEED ANY
(By Review Leiwed Wire)
WASHINGTON. Dec. 11. With a
total value of $12,272,412,000, the na
tion's principal farm crops this year, were
worth more, based on prices paid to farm
ers December 1, than in any year in the
history of American agriculture. Decem
ber crop estimates today, of the depart
ment of agriculture, showed that this year's,
total exceeds that of the former record year,
1 9 1 7, by $6 1 4,380.000. There also was a
marked increase in acreage, the 355,895,
722 total, exceeding that of last year by
10.700,000 acres.
These crop figures were looked, upon
with satisfaction by officials, as showing
that the nation'will be in even a better po
sition to fulfill its pledge of 20.000,000
tons of foodstuffs to Europe next year than
had been expected.

President Wilson will make to the
American troops, probably as soon
after his arrival in France as pos-
sible is expected to be one of the
n.ost important delivered during
his stay in Europe, and is being

not yet been determined.
The president, it is announced, will
visit devastated districts in France
and, although the present plans are
tentative, all depending upon his per

into foqpier German territory. Visits
to Metz and Strasbourg are extremely
probable,
President Wilson will lunch with
President Poincare on Saturday soon
after his arrival. The plans for Sunday
have not yet been made known. On
Monday President Wilson will hold a
reception in the Paris city hall, to
which a host of officials have been
invited.
The Associated Press is in a posi

Wilson, will visit Italy, but no date
has been fixed A hundred invitations
or more for the president to visit va

countries are being received daily.
Naturally these are being held pend

he will unquestionably need all the

That is almost half a billion bushels less

The wheat crop is larger than the five

Almost all of the crops were worth more

Commercial Club Smoker for
New Organization to Pro

People
As a stimulus to good fellow
ship, civic prfcie and co-operation,
district development,' personal ac
quaintance and . business condi
tions, the Warren District Lunch
eon club will be inaugurated to
day at noon, when some 40 busi
ness and professional men of the
district will meet at the Copper
Qaeen hotel In the first of a se- .
ries of weekly luncheons. The
club will be1 founded on the prin
ciples of advancement of the dis
trict, and is being organized
through the Warren District Com
mercial club.
At the first meeting , of the club
nothing but the routine of" organiza
tion will be undertaken. Included in
this routine will be the election of the
first president, secretary and treasur
er and the appointment of the first
program and membership committees.
"Active plana for the future meet
ings of the club will be made follow
ing the naming of the first program
committee. These plans will include
a regular program for each luncheon
hour. The programs will consist of
discussion of civic problems, district
activities, and similar questions which
demand the attention of the citizens
of the citizens of the Warren district,
addresses or remarks by prominent
visitors who may be in the district,
and other interesting subjects. Occa
sionally, that the tone of the meet ings
may not become too monotonous, a lit
tle of the vaudeville or comic will be
introduced.
Among the features of the organiza
tion will be that of electing a new
president every three months. One
of the aims of the club is to enable
every man who attends its luncheons
to speak from his feet.. By the rotat
ing of the presidency and other of
fices, and by the Introduction of va
rious subjects in which every man is
interested this can be accomplished.
Changing of the officers often. It has
been found in the experience of other
clubs, has increased the interest in
the club meetings and tended to add
life and enthusiasm to the luncheons.
The luncheons will be served in the
dining room of the Copper Queen ho
tel, where one part of the room will
be turned over to the club every
Thursday noon. The luncheon wiy be
the regular 'hotel daily luncheon and
will be served to the members at the
regular luncheon price. Members of
the club will be charged at the rate
of 35 cents a week for membership,
and an additional 25 cents on days
when they attend the luncheons. The
forfeitures received from this small
fund will be expected to take care of
all expenses of the club, including the
entertainment of guests, the payment
for guests' lunches, printing and sitni
lar costs.
Following the luncheon today a
membership committee which will be
chosen at the luncheon will take up
the extension of the membership
throughout the district, with an aim
to having every business house and
every professional man's office repre
sented each week at the club meet
ing. The first luncheon is merely for
the purpose of organization and selec
tion of officers.

In making this announcement the
newly elected executive of the senior
league said that there had been gen
eral discussion regardins; the non-recall
of waivers, limitation of player
rosters. 1919 schedules, number of
gamfe and other details, but that the

SACRAMENTO. Cel.. Dec. 11.
Eleven jurors had been accepted tenta
tively in the industrial Workers ot
tiie World conspiracy trial in the
United States district court here when
court adjourned tonight.
There was a prospect that one of
the 11 jurors would be excused when
court reconvened tomorrow. United
States District Judge H. F. Rudkin
announced that the juror, Samuel A.
Palandech. a restaurant proprietor,
had received word that a bother had
disappeared in New Mexico and that
Palandech desired to take up the
search immediately if he did not re
ceive word of his relative's safety
overnight. It was agreed he would
be excused if no further word was re
ceived. Many prospective jurors were ex
cused in rapid succession this after
noon and two special venires were
exhausted because a number of those
summoned for service stated they had
formed an opinion in regard to the
case which they could not discard
easily.
S.'ience says that old age begins
with weakened kidneys and digestive
organs.
This being true, it is easy to believe
that l-y keeping the kidneys and diges
tive organs cleansed and in proper
working order old age can be defe.-red
and life prolonged far beyond that en
joyed by the average person.

The Farmer Receives More Than Five
Thousand Dollars a Minute From
Swift & Company
This amount is paid to the farmer for' live stock, by
Swift & Company alone, during the trading hours of every
business day.
All this money is paid to the farmer through the open
market in competition with large and small packers, ship
pers, speculators and dealers.
The former, feeder, or shipper receives every cent of this money
($300,OCOan hcur, nearly $2,000,000 a da', $11,500,000 a week) in
cash, on the spot, as soon as the stock he has just sold is weighed up.
Some of the money paid to the farmed during a single day comes
back to the company in a month from sale of products; much does
not come back for sixty or ninety days or more. But the next day
Swift & Company, to meet the demands made by its customers,
must pay out . another $2,000,000 or so, and at the present high
price levels keeps over $250,000,000 continuously lied up in goods on
the way to market and in bills owed to the cftmpany.
This gives an idea of the volume of the Swift & Company busi
ness, and the requirements of financing it. Only by doing a large
business can this company turn live stock into meat and by-products
at the lowest possible cost, prevent waste, operate refrigerator cars,
distribute to retailers in all parts of the' country and be recompensed
with a profit of only a fraction of a cent a pound a profit too small
to have any noticeable effect on the price of meat or live stock.

Class War
Samuel Gompers, leader of organized
labor in this country, is back from Europe,
where he successfully concluded a mission
in a most high and patriotic cause. He is
vice-president of the National Civic federa
tion. In the last issue of the Review, the
official organ of this body, appears an edi
torial warning against the danger of bol
shevism and the extremes of all radical and
socialistic movements that is as strong as
any yet sounded on any printed page. In
part, it says:
Uninformed people in America and
other countries may fondly imagine that
events in Jar-away Russia do not threaten
their safety and institutions. A greater
mistake could not be made.
Having achieved what they consider
success in Russia, the bolsheviki and their
organs (no opposition newspapers being
allowed) began threatening that they
"would carry the class war to every coun
try in the world." This notification should
have been taken seriously, but it was not.
For years socialists and the I. W. W. have
been preaching the class war. They had
the design but lacked the means. The bol
sheviki have the financial resources, and
the socialist party spokesmen and 'their fol
lowers in the United States are now boldly
avowing themselves bolshevists.
How many of our people here know that
the bolsheviki have control of 800,000.000
rubles in gold, which is part of what they
found in the Russian treasury as a reserve,
when they seized power? But this is by no
means all. They found also 800.000.000
francs in gold which had been transferred
from Rumania before the revolution. In ad
dition, they have confiscated immense
sums in private funds and have appropri
ated great quantities of jewels and other
valuables. ,
This constitutes a campaign fund for in
stigating the class war whereverthey can.
They are using it effectively. ''Lenine is
flooding the Scandinavian countries with
propaganda money," cables Bassett Digby,
the Stockholm correspondent of the New
York Globe and the Chicago Daily News.
"The bolsheviki have their own printing
works near Berne and 10,000,000 rubles
are admitted to have been placed in the
Swiss Bank to the credit of their propa
ganda," cables Julian Grande, the Berne
correspondent of the New York Times. In
England. Italy, France and other countries
the bolshevik movement has suddenly
sprung into widespread activity and shows
signs of being well financed. "We are fe
verishly awaiting the eve of the western
European revolution," reecntly exulted
The Red Army, a bolshevist Moscow daily
newspaper.
What of America? Many of the bol
shevist leaders and the most powerful
are men who went back from here to Rus
sia in 1 9 1 7. No observant person can have
failed to notice the systematic outbreak of
bolshevist agitation here. Expensively
manufactured magazines have suddenly
made their appearance. The Class Strug
gle, published in Brooklyn, every line of
which is a bolshevist incitement or distor
tion, is art instance. Book after book is
being run off the press. "We know." says
The Red Army, the word democracy is as
sociated with the word republic only to
cheat the people." The book writers
promptly take their cue. "There is a war
beneath the war." insists Walter E. Weyl.
in his recently issued book, "The End of the
War," in concluding which, he says: "It
will be a wider conflict than that which
now rages (the great world war), and the
alignment will be by classes and interests,
rather than by nations.'
From Montreal comes this Associated
Press dispatch: "Lumber camps in Can
ada are veritable hotbeds of bolshevik and
I. W.'W. propaganda, according to the
Rev. Thomas Joplin, field secretary of the
Shanteymen's Christian association, who
has just returned from a tour of the camps.
He declares thousands of inflammatory
pamphlets have been distributed in the
camps urging the workers, most of them
foreigners, to resist all authority, 'by dyna
mite if necessary.' "
"We have sent out in all directions the
call of the international workers' revolu
tion,' triumphantly announces Lenine in a
signed statement.
There are only a few signs of a brewing
menace. All of the forces of civilization
that do not want an unleashing of armed
anarchy will do well to reflect upon their
meaning and hasten to act.
CONSCRIPTION MUST
GO, SAYS BRITISH
PREMIER IN SPEECH
(Continued from I'm!1'
Tip-
or
rend-
terms
That expression that has designated the
Balkans as the powder magazine of Europe
still applies. After four years of war, this
magazine still sounds, as inflammable and
dangerous and more potential as a cause
of trouble than ever. How will the Serb
feel towards, the Bulgar, who stabbed him
in the back? How will the Greek feel to
wards this same Bulgar, 'who 'took and
tried to hold Macedonia? And the Ruman
ian, bruised and beaten, through the treach
ery of the Slav, to the northward? And
the Pole, what will he do after three cen
turies of slavery, with his freedom full
blown in a day? And the Jugo and Cze-cho-Slavs,
each now a separate state, burst
ing with ideas and ideals and pent up na
tionality? The two great masters of all
these little states, and closest neighbors,
Austria and Russia, are in the midst of
riot, revolution, chaos and famine. How
will Italy act towards her small charges
to the eastward? Greed and love of
power are the natural and general
attributes of all races and nations. Will
Italy rise above these and be humble
and kind, remembering her own bondage
under the Austrian yoke? She is not act
ing as though she would do this. The Bal
kan pot still boils. It's settlement seems
further off than ever. In fact, not the Bal
kans alone, but the world at large, is a
powder magazine today. Leaders of wis
dom, tolerance, force, fairness, unselfish
ness and foresight are needed by all the
allied nations now, more than at any time
in the world's. history. Tremendous ques
tions, all of them intensely inflammable,
remain yet to be settled.
Holland is getting into a more and more,
uncomfortable and unenviable place in the
world's books every day. As a neutral,
she exchanged allied foodstuffs for Ger
man gold and preferred that her ships rot
in port at German command than to be
used by the allies. She played always he
cheap and mean part, absolutely servile to
wards the Prussian in all essentials. And
now, she gives an asylum to the arch crim
inal of modern times. When the crash
came it was towards Holland that the Pots
dam gang did turn. Why? The fallen
prince and potentate has an unerring in
stinct in flight from righteous wrath.
Henceforth all Hoh'enzollern plots will be
hatched in Holland, under the protection
of the Dutch government. That is. until
the allied hand shall be stretched forth to
pluck these plotters away. And a good
shaking for the small and sordid and self
ish kingdom of Holland would not be amiss
at the time that Wilhelm is taken away.
In view of the declarations of President
Wilson upon the subject of freedom of the
seas, unusual interest attaches to the speech
of Premier Lloyd George, in which he
touched on Great Britain's intention of re
taining her great navy. The British navy,
Mr. Lloyd George said, had in the past
protected the Island empire from invasion
and would do so again. "Our navy is a
defensive weapon and not an offensive
one; that is why we do not mean to give
it up." Insofar as England is concerned
it is evident that "freedom of the seas" is a
mere phrase, nice sounding, but which can
not be translated to mean abolition of the
sea power she has built up so painstakingly.
Here is the entire story of the U. S. A's.
part in the great war, all' in a few words in
a nutshell: A regiment at Seichprey in
March of nineteen-eighteen ; A division at
Cantigny in May; three divisions on the
Marne in June; six divisions in July; an
army corps at St. Mihiel in August-September,
and two armies all told, from Lc
Cateau to Ponta-Mousson in November.
The dragon's teeth that Jason sowed in
Asia Minor did not spring more quickly
into armed men than did that regiment at
Seichprey.
Great Britain would require consc
tion in tne imure m any snape
form, Mr. Lloyd George said, depe
ed not UDon the opinion which he now
whlt'i were maue.
Continuing, the prime minister said:
DRIVEN TO CONSCRIPTION
"What drove ns to conscription was
the existence of conscription armies
on the continent that inevitably
rushed the world into war. They
could not have great military ma-
ti1n tliprri u-ithont tpmntinz the
men at the head of them to try their
luck with those machines. The Ger
mans always felt there was nothing
to resist their perfect military ma
chine. "If you want a permanent peace;
if you want to prevent the horrors
of "this war being repeated you must
put an end to conscript aimies on
the continent of Europe.
"The nrst thins to clo is to pe
vent the repetition of blunders of the
navf hv mnkine It Impossible ot have
those great conscript armies In the
future.
Navy Purely Defensive
"Wa Hil nnt have thn macllinerv for
war. Our navy is a defensive weapon
and rot an oltejisive one; ana xnai is
why we do not mean to give it up.
We have kept these islands free from
invasion for centuries and we mean
to take no risk in the future."
w.r I.lnvH C.pnTefi rieelnred that tha
decision which would be taken in the
next few months at the peace con
ference was going to leave a mark
upon the world. The ages to come,
he said, would be able to reap the
fruits of it.
Deals With Indemnity
The Dreniier next dealt with thr
question of indemnity. He declared
the war had cost Germany less man
it had cost Great Britain. It had
cost Great Britain, he declared, 8,000.
Aim nnft nrmnrU a picantic sum. The
German bill, he beiievet'.. was six cr
seven billion pounds. He contenaea
It was indefensible that the person
who was iu the wrong and had lost
should pay less than the person who
was declared to be in tne rigm anu
had won.
States rive Points
Tim nrnmirr sM RriMsh Imuerial
commission had been appointed to In-
pay, and that he had received its re
port. He summarized nis remarits on
this point as follows:
First:. As far as justice is concerned.
wr h.v. an uhcnlnto rivht In (ieniand
the whole cost of the war from Ger
many. -
"Second: Wo propose to demand
the whole cost of the war from Ger
many.
"Third: When we come to the exact
ing of it we must exact in such a
way that it does not do more narm
m the rnuntrv that receives it than
the country that is paying it.
Fourth: The -commission appoint
ed by the Pritish government believes
that that can be done.
"Fifth: The allies are in exactly the
camA hnat VA JlIll mil ifl OUT de
mands all together and whatever they
are, they must come in iront 01 me
German war debt."
The prime minister continued:
"The first consideration in the
minds of the allies will be the inter
ests of the people upon hom the
Germans have made war and not in
the Interests of the German people,
who have made war and have been
guilty of that crime."
Deceives German Empire
With regard to the former German
emperor, the premier said:
"There is absolutely no doubt that
be has committed a crime againsi in
ternational right and there is abso
lutely no doubt that he ought to be
held responsible for it, so far as the
European allies are concerned."
The premier said he hoped that
America would take the same view,
when President Wilson arrived, as
to the demand that would be put for
ward, on the part of the European
allied "to make the kaiser and his
accomplices responsible for this ter
rible crime."
Referring to a letter, said to have
been written by a British general to
a French general, in which the Brit
ish officer was quoted as saying it
was proposed to establish a British
national army of twenty divisions
based on conscription but that "the
cabinet would not touch this until
after the" elections and then not un
til this league of nations nonsense
has been discussed at the pence con
ference," Tremier Lloyd George de
clared:
"Tho cabinet never heard of the
scheme. So far as the cabinet is con
cerned it is purely an expression of
the opinion of some general."

(Bv Review Incased Wire)
WASHINGTON', Dec. 11. All South
American countries have been asked
by the United States to join in its sug
gestion to Chile and Peru that the in
terests of Pan-American unity demand
and amicable settlement of their con
troversy over the provinces of Tacna
and Arica. Acting Secretary Polk of
the state department, announced this
today, explaining that it had been er
roneously reported that Argentina
alone had been approached on the
subject.
Secretary Polk made it clear that
the American government was not of
fering its good offices to compose the
trouble between the two South Amer
ican republics, but at the same time
let it be known that if such good of
fices were requested they would ex
tend promptly. This information was
conveyed to all the South American
republics with the suggestion that
each make similar representations to
both Chile and Peru.
The American government was re
ported as being particularly desirous
that conditions in the western hemi
sphere be, settled during the meeting
of the peace conference at Paris. The
-Tacna and Arica dispute, it was said,
is the only serious disagreement now
existing in the western world. i
ASK FOR EXPLANATION
BUENOS AIRES, Dec. 11 The Chil
ean government has sent a message to
the government of Argentina, asking
the latter to explain its offer of media
tion In the controversy between Peru
and Chile, The message inquires
whether mediation would be confined
to clearing the present crisis, which
grew out of the disturbances at Iqui
que, or whether it would contemplate
a settlement of the old question of the
provinces of Tacna and Arica.
The Chilean newspapers assert that
the government of Chile would accept
intervention with the object of set
tling the lquique trouble, but would re
ject it in the Tana-Arica dispute.

purpose of serving efficiently the
paramount needs of the war and at
I the same time furnishing the best pos
I sible service to the public, whether
I such operation tended to prove or
disprove any theory of railroad con
trol, no master what It might be. I
have formed no opinion myself as to
what Is the best disposition of the
railroad problem because the test has
not been sufficient to prove conclu
sively the right solution of the prob
lem. I believe that a five-year test
will give the American people the
right answer. An ounce of experi
ence is worth a ton of theory.
Doesn't Mean Ownership.
"There are those who may say that
an extension of five years for such a
test will mean government ownership.
Personally, I do not believe it. But
whether such a test would indicate
that the ultimate solution shall be
! government ownership or a modified
form of private ownership under ef-"
fective federal regulation, should not I
cause us to hesitate or refuse to act."
"If congress does not extend the
time for government contro, said
Mr. McAdoo, 'tlie railroads should
be returned to private management
at the earliest possible moment."
Practical difficulties of continuing
government operations under exist
ing authority, he pointed out, are the
growing conflicts of authority be
tween state and federal jurisdictions.
Inadequacy of the half billion dollar
revolving fund for financing Improve
ments, inability to force railroads to
pay for cars and locomotives without
litigation, and to require terminal
improvements.
Prosperity in Balance.
"Upon the efficiency of the trans
portation machine in America," said
Mr. McAdoo, "depends in great meas
ure the future prosperity of the na
tion. Involved in this property is the
extension of our foreign trade. We
produce so much more than we con
sume that markets must be found for
that surplus. Those markets are the
competitive markets of the world.
We must be able to enter them upon
equal terms with any other nation.
Our transportation system., both on
land and water, must, therefore, func
tion at the highest point of efficiency
and at the lowest possible cost, if we
are to get our reasonable and fair
share of the world's trade and in turn
be able to keep a prosperous, con
tented and happy population at
home.
Competition Is Hurtful.
"To attempt to continue federal
control under the inadequate provi
sions of tbe present federal control
act and for the very brief period it
authorizes, would be to multiply our
difficulties and invite failure. On
the other hand, I am convinced from
the experience of the past year, that
the return of the railroads to the old
competitive standard would be hurt
ful alike to the public Interest and
to the railroads themselves. This
course, however, will bring fewer
evils in Its train than the unsatisfac
tory if not impotent federal control
provided for by the present act. The
railroads were taken over as a war
measure. They have been operated
mount purpose of winning the war.
1 think it will be generally admitted
that the war service has been suc
cessfully rendered and I am sure that
'experience of great value and benefit
has been gained, not only for the
publio but for the railroads them
selves during this brief test."
Conference Called Today.
A conference of representatives of
interests; affected by transportation
will be held here tomorrow and rri-
day at the call of the United Chamber
of commerce to formulate a statement
of principles wMch may Berve as the
basis for popular dlscusbion of the
nation's future attitude toward rail
roads and other transportation agen
cies. The conference will be informal
and development of a definite pro
gram is not expected at this time.
President Is Puzzled.
President Wilson in Ws recent ad
dress to congress said he was unable
to decide what should be done with
the railroads, and asked congress to
take up the question for discussion
Immediately. He declared that unless
action was forthcoming he would be
forced to turn back the railroads to
private management.
Acting under this plan, the railroad
administration had been preparing to

relinquish control of the railroads, and
it was the general understanding that
the administration would wait two or
three months before actually starting
the relinquishment proceedings to
give congress a chance to act. Re
cent developments have shown the
difficulty of determining a final policy
at this time, however, according to
railroad administration officials.
Managers Want Roads.
Most railroad owners and managers
are said to have urged that the roads
be relinquished, but under some sort
of remedial legislation giving them
power to pool their resources and
eliminate wasteful competition. There
have been no important advocates of
restoration of the old conditions, ac
cording to officials. On the other
band, the friends of government own
ership have just begun to renew agi
tation for retention by the govern
ment of permanent control, and later
purchase of the railroads" property.
When the railroad control bill was
enacted, Mr. McAdoo urged that tha
period of control not be limited to 21
months after the formal close of the
war, saying this would not give op
portunity for a real test of govern
ment management. At that time he
expressed himself aa opposed to gov
ernment ownership.
Recently he again expressed dis
appointment that government man
agement had such limitations, saying
that there was danger of the railroad
question becoming a political issue
in the elections of 1920. This would
be unfortunate, he said, because the
railroad question was purely economic
and should not properly be entangled
with political issues.
CREATES NO SURPLUS
PHILADELPHIA, Dec. 11. Recom
mendation by Director General Mc
Adoo that government control of rail
roads continue until January, 1924,
was no surprise to the railroad execu
tives of the country, it was learned
today. The railroad executive advis
ory committee, which is in confer
ence here on problems relating to the
return of the roads to private opera
tion, had intimations from Washing
ton that the administration was con
sidering the advisability of recom
mending an extension of government
control.
The railroad beads, however, read
with great interest the Washington
dispatches, especially the reasons giv
en by Director General McAdoo for re
commending the continuance, but i
none of them would express his
views.
The advisory committee is made up

NEW YORK, Dec. 11. A proclama

the people of the United States to
contribute money to sustain the Ar
menian, Syrian, Greek and other war
sufferers In the near east, during
the winter, was made public here to
day by the American committee for
Armenian and Syrian relief. This
committee, with the American com
mittee for relier in the near east,
will conduct a campaign to raise a
minimum of $30,000,000 from January
19 tn 19. in finance this relief pro
ject, which is approved also by the
French government, me presmeni s
proclamation, dated at the White
House on November 29. in part,
reads:
"It Is estimated that about 4,000.000
Armenian, Syrian, Greek and other

home lands. The vast majority of
them are helpless women and chil
dren, including 400,000 orphans.
"I therefore again call upon the
people of the United States to make
even more generous contnouiions

centage of Fatalities, Not Over One
Death Out of Every Four Hundred

of Health. The Chief Danger Lies
in Complications Arising, Attacking
Principally Patient in a Run Down
Condition Those Who Don't Go to
Bed Soon Enough, or Those Who
Get Up Too Early
! NO OCCASION FOR PANIC
: Spanish influenza, which appeared
in Spain in May. has all the appear
lance of grip or la grippe, which has
swept over the world in numerous
epidemics as far back as history runs.
I Hippocrates refers to an epidemic in
Ul2 H. C, which Is regarded by many
to have been influenza. Every cen
, tury has had its attacks. Beginning
i with 1831, this country has had five
jepidemics, the last in 18S9-90.
THE SYMPTOMS
i Grip, or Influenza, as it Is now
I called, usually begins with a chill, fol
! lowed by aching, feverishness and
sometimes nausea and dizziness, and
a general feeling of weakness and de
gression. The temperature is from
1 100 to 104, and the fever usually lasts
from three to five days. The germs
attack the mucous membrane, or lin
ing of the air passages nose, throat
and bronchial tubes there is usually
a hard cough, especially bad at niclit,
often times a soar throat or tonsilitis.
and frequently all the appearances of
a severe head cold.
THE TREATMENT
Go to bed at the first symptoms, not
only for your own sake, but to avoid
spreading the disease to others take
a nurcative. eat plenty of nourishing
food, remain perfectly quiet and don't
worry. Quinine, Aspirin or Dover's
Powder, etc.. may be adiuinistere.l by
the iiIivmIi ian's directions to relieve
the aching. But there is no euro or
specific . for influenza Uie disease
must run its course. Nature herself
will throw off the attack if only you
Veep up your strength. The chief
danger lies in the complication which
may arise. Influenza so weakens the
bodily resistance that there is danger
of pneumonia or bronchitis develop
Idk. and sometimes inflammation of
the middle ea'. or heart affections.
S Ui.r these reasons, it Is very Import-
ant that the patieut remain in bed un
til his strength returns stay in bed
at least two days or more arier me
fvpr ha left vou. or if von are over
60 or not strong, stay in bed four days
or more, according to tne severny oi
the attack.
EXTERNAL APPLICATIONS
, In order to stimulate the lining of
tha nlr nnsanees to throw riff the eriD
germs, to aid in loosening the phlegm
and keeping trie air passages open,
thus making the breathing easier,
virir'B VnnnRnh win he found effect
ive. Hot. wet towels should be ap
plied over the tnroat, cnest ana oac
between the shoulder blades to open
the pores. Then VapoRub should be
rubbed in over the parts until the skin
Is red. spread on thickly and covered
with two thicknesses of hot flannel
cloths. Leave the clothing loose
around the neck as the heat of tne
body liberates the ingredients in the
form of vapor. These vapors, in
haled with each breath, carry the
medication directly to the parts af
fected. At the same time, VapoRub Is
absorbed through and stimulates the
skin, attracting the blood to the sur
face, and thus aids in relieving the
congestion within.
HOW TO AVOID THE DISEASE
Evidence seems to prove that this is
a germ disease, spread principally by
human contact, chiefly through cough
ing, sneezing or spitting. So avoid
ing crowds common drinking cups,
roller towels, etc. Keep up your bod
ily strength by plenty of exercise in
the open air and good food.
KEEP FREE FROM COLDS.
Above all. keep free from colds, as
colds irritate the lining of the air pas
sages and render them much better
breeding places for the germs. I'se
Vicks VapoRub at the very first sign
cf a cold. For a head cold, melt a lit
tle VapoRub In a spoon and Inhale the
vapors, or better still. Use VapoRub in
a benzoin steam kettle. If this is not
available. UKe an ordinary teakettle
Fill half full of boiling water, put in
half a teaspoon of VapoRub from time
to time keep the kettle Just slowly
boiling and inhale the steam arising.
NOTE: Vicks VapoRub is the discov
ery of a North Carolina druggist, who
found how to combine, in salve form.
Menthol and Camphor with such vola
tile oils as Eucalyptus. Thyme. Cu
bebs. etc., so that when the salve, is
applied to the body heat, these ingre
dients are liberated in the form of
vapors.

ISOLATION

FOR THIS NATION
BAL.TI.A1UKE, Aid., Dec. 11. "The
day of isolation in the United States
has passed for good or ill, and I pro
foundly believe it is for good. This
republic must confront itself with ev
ery problem that touches the people
of every portion of the world." de
clared Secretary of the Navy Daniels
in an address at a banquet given here
ed the emergency hospital closed. The
city will now care for its patients in
dependent of the county, declared the
board and county health authorities,
who believe the same mistake is being
made here as in Denver, San Francis
co and other cities in the United
States, where the ban was lifted when
the epidemic was in the same stage as
it is in this city. Since the city has
taken this action, despite our opposi
tion, it can care for its own cases and
we will care for ours," said the super
visors. "The city was determined to
open the town and it has done so. We
can only hope that history will not re
peat itself and Phoenix suffer as other
places have suffered by taking this
en' j action too soon." The county, on
fr recommendation of its health depart-
t ment. will maintain a ward at St.
Joseph's hospital. Patients who could
not be removed from the emergency
hospital to their homes were taken
there last evening. The county will
continue to conduct its emergency
hospitals in Mesa. Tempe, Chandler,
Buckeye and Glendale. John D. Loper,
appointed by the board of supervisors
as their representative to have charge
of the emergency hospitals during the
epidemic, may be forced to resign if
the schools open on Monday.

BY REVIEW
NEW YORK, Doc. ' 11. Aside from
i oils, rotors and other speculative spe-
cialties, which registered gross gains
i cf 2 to 8 points, today's stock market
presented no features of interest.
Trading was light, easier money con
ditions failing to stinrulate public
support.
The petroleum group contributed
far more than its usual quota, Mexican
recording a gross gain of 8 points
after an early setback. United States
Steel and associated issues were
steady to firm during the early and
intermediate periods, but fell back
later. Rails were apathetic through
out. Motors were irregular, mainly
in consequence of the uncertain move
ment of Studebaker, which suffered
from further selling pressure in con
rection with the company's proposed
financing.
Metals, tobaccos, leathers., fertiliz
ers and the distilling issues lacked
definil! tendencies on greatly re
duced operations, becoming moderate
ly unsettled, however, in the general
reaction of the last hour. Total sales
amounted to 540,000 shares.
Dealings in bonds were without
especial feature, both domestic iiiid
foreign issues showing moderate ir
regularity. Liberty bonds eased
again, but held above recent low rec
ords. Total sales, par value, aggrv
gated $9,650,000. Ola united states
bonds were unchanged on call.
GRAIN MARKET.
CHICAGO, 111.. Dec. 11. Corn ad
vanced in alue today on tho correct
assumption that a cut might e made
in the government estimate of the
191S yield. The market closed firr".,
i to net higher, with January
1.31 to 1.32 and May 1.30 to
1.30V4- Oats finished V&c off to -o
up and provisions varying from 12c
decline to rise of 15c.
Although the government crop re
port did not become public until after
trading hours, the fact was well un
derstood beforehand that the revised
figures from Washington in regard to
corn production this season were
likely to show decided shrinkaco as
compared with preliminary estimates.
The consequence was something of a
bulge all around in prices, especially
during the last 15 minutes. Earlier
in the day free buying, of January de
livery for a leadiug elevator company
was a notable feature, but the bullish
effect on the market as a whole was
partly counterbalanced owing to per
sistent selling of May on the port of I
commission houses with country con-;
nection.
Oats held within narrow limit.
Trade was light, mainly local.
Expected resumption of hog ship
ments to Chicago tomorrow largely
offset in the provision market the
influence of the immense government
of meats and lard 'to the seaboard.
COTTON MARKET.
NEW YORK, Dec- 11. Cotton
closed steady at a net decline of 20
to 74 points.

NOTES FROM RED CROSS SHOP
A dull business week at the Red
Cross shop partially because of the
weather and greatly because of the
lack of certain kinds of clothing that
the people most need, suits of clothes
for men, extra trousers and dress
skirts are much in demand, also toys
for the Christmas sale and any fancy
thing that you may have tired of that
will help the Christmas display.
The shop hopes to have a display of
bags, boudoir caps and aprons which
people are requested to make and send
in.
The plant or the Esmerald Isle com
pany, in Mohave county, is now turn
ing out 2500 pounds of electrolytic

COCHISE PIONEER DIES
IN YUMA MONDAY
The following item taken from the
Yuma Sun of Tuesday recalls to the
pioneer residents of Tombstone and
Cochise county or one they well
knew:
"The death of Ward Pliest occurred
yesterday morning, Monday, December
9, at the home of his youngest daugh
ter; Mrs. Adel Priest Lindeman, on
Orange avenue. .
"With the passing of Mr. Priest one
of the Arizona pioneers has taken
the long trail to eternity. came
to Yuma 24 years- ago and had resid
ed in this vicinity until death cfaimed
him. Although he had not been well
for several months past, he was not
seriously ill until a little over a week
ago, when his oldest daughter. Mrs.
Gertrude Kirkpatrick. was sent for. All
of his four children were with him sit
the end.
"Ward Priest was born at Marietta,
Ohio. December 31, 1848. He came
to California in 1869 and in 1S7S
he came on horseback across the
desert to Tombstone, the year of the
silver strike. He struck it rich in
the silver district and made a for
tune on his mines. In 18S0 he re
turned to California and married
Adele Frairy, who was the first
woman to cross the Colorado river
on a train when they went into
Tucson on a freight. In 1894 they
came to Yuma ana invested in real
estate.
"The old Priest home in West Yuma
is one of the landmarks of the town.
Mrs. Priest died ten years ago and
since that time Mr. Priest has lived
with his children here in Yuma.-
"There are four surviving children.
Mrs. Gertrude Kirkpatrick, Ray Priest,
Mrs. Adele Lindeman and Henry
Priest. All are married and live in
Yuma with the exception ot Mrs.
Kirkpatrick, who .moved to San Diego
about a year ago."

ALL THAT IS NEEDED: LOCAL
TALK OF PETITION TO CON
GRESS FOR APPROPRIATION
the Lisbe
rai'.road station is anchor-
ted mid stream with all lights doused.
Folks who go to the train to meet ar
rivals both wonder and cuss. The po
lice are in no less bad case,. Only
the he.irts of the bootleggers and some,
other furtive individuals make happy
.response to the inky darkness thrown
j over the station platform by the black
t hadov ot the depot building.
In former days, not long ago, the
alighted in comfort and wun visum
knowledge of their whereabouts,
Those waiting for them went forward
and gave greetings by sense 'of sight
and not of feel and hearing, and per
haps sometimes of smell.
Recently the railroad administration
let out another link of conservation ,
and the nif,bt baggageman or any oth
er man has become a minurf quantity
at the depot. The latter runs as dark
as a weir regulated tomb after the de
parture of the night train for the west.
So there is no one about to turn on thf
the platform liht. and no one can get
at it to turn it on because it's inside
the locked baggage room door. A 32
cent appropriation would be necessary
to get the push button outside of the
door at a sufficient height to be out
of the reach of boys, but very handy
for a policeman who would lje glad to
use it at train timcand turn it off
thereafter. A petition to congress is
being prepared; alio the necessary let
ters to the raiiroad administration de
partments and the various Washing
ton committees involved and in a year
or so it is confidently believed that
there will be brighter nights in the
depot latitude, consequent upon get
ting that appropriation through.
FIRE IN BASEMENT
JUNIOR HIGH SCHOOL
Both divisions cf the Hisbee fire
department were called out last eve
ning shortly after 6 o'clock to answer
an alarm turned in from box 45 on j
Quality Hill caused by a fire ii the;
basement of the new Horace Mann, j
Jr.. high school. The firemen had j
considerable difficulty in putting out
the fire which had started in a pile
of excelsior, paper and other packing !
that had been taken from the funii-j
ture boxes and the coal stared there, j
It took consistent work on the part j
of the fireman for abor.t 30 minutes j
to get the fire out. There was not 1
much blaze, but tha basement was I
filled with smoke and there was no :
ventilation and the men had to take j
turns in oing In to fight the fire and
then come out into the fresh air. The '
entire building-was filled with smoke. !
but there was no damage done to the i
building or contents except what coal
and kindling was consumed. It is the
opinion of the firemen that the fire
was from spontaneous combustion.
The department did good work and I
are entitled to considerable credit. i
