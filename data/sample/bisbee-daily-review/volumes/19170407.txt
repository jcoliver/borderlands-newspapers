ALL ARE RINGLEADERS
IN VAST CONSPIRACIES
AGAINST UNITED STATES
(By Review
WASHINGTON,
April 6. The
arrest of sixty alleged ring lead
ers in German plots, conspiracies
and machinations in the United
States was ordered today by At
torney General Gregory immedi
ately after President Wilson had
signed the war resolution.
' Every man whose arrest was
v ordered is a German citizen; is
known by the department of jus
tice, it was authoritatively stat
ed, to have participated actively
in German intrigues in this coun
try, and is regarded as a danger-
ous person to be at liberty.
Held During War
Bail will be refused in each
case, it was said, and the entire
group will be locked up unless
there is a change in present
plans, for the duration of the war ,
More Arrests Coming
TKffl cations are that a number
of other arrests will be ordered
""within the next few days.
The men are placed in three groups
Those who have been convicted of
violation of American neutrality in
furthering German plots of various
sorts are at liberty under bond await
ing the action of higher courts; those
who have been indicted by federal
grand juries for similar offenses and
are at liberty on bond awaiting trial.
and persons neither indicted nor con'
victed but whose activities have been ;
under surveillance.
Invokes War Act
For the first time in more than a
century arrests of alien enemies un
der the attorney general's order will
be made without reference to the
courts or bonds granted. The Presi
dent is. authorized to adopt this
course in time of war under an act
oT congress passed in . 179S and not
invoked since the war with great
Britain in 1812. .

WASHINGTON, April 6. While a

man merchant vessels which vere j

or who have been active in German
propaganda or because of their ac
centuated leanings toward the Ger
man government are regarded as like
ly to work against the interests of the
United States during the war.
200,000 Reservists in U. S.
How many German reservists
are in the United States, a high
official said tonight, has neveY
been accurately determined. This
official's belief was that the num
ber ranged between 150.000 and
200,000. The great majority, it
was said, are men in middle life
I or beyond or men who have been
in this country for so many years
that their sympathies are consid
ered transplanted to the United
States, there are however, it was
said, between 15,000 and 18.000
young Qerman reservists in this
country in the prime of life who
have been here so short a time
not more thaa from three to five
years that they may be properly
regarded as potential sources of
trouble. Upon them the secret
service and the bureau of investi
gation have concentrated much
energy.
Many are Paid Spies
For obvious reasons the
ment of justice withheld the names
of persons apprehended but it was
gajd that virtually all of them could
be classed as quasi-officials of the
German government. Many, it is al
leged, were the instrumentalities
through which Captains Boy-Ed and
von Papen carried out their activities
in this country against the allies. A
few of them, it was said, could be
classed as spies.
The department is prepared to con
test to the highest court any effort
made to liberate under bond or by
habeas corpus proceedings, the men
under arrest. The manner in which
the arrests were ordered made by
u. s. marsnats, rortnwitn, without
reference to the courts is a wartime
step unauthorized in time of peace.

WASHINGTON, Aprik 6. The United States today accepted Germany's
challenge to war and formally abandoned its place as the greatest neu
tral o fa world in arms.
President Wilson at 1:18 (official time) o'clock this afternoon signed
the resolution of congress declaring. the existense of a state of war and
authorizing and directing the chief executive to employ all the resources
of the nation to prosecute hostilities against the German government to
a successful termination.
NEWS FLASHED TO U. S. SHIPS OVER WORLD
The act ws done without ceremony and only in the presence of mem
bers of the President's family. Word was flashed immediately to alt army
and navy stations and to vessels at Sea, and orders for further precau
tionary steps were dispatched.
ORM ALLY PROCLAIMS WAR
By proclamation the President announced the state of war, called
upon all citizen to manifest their loyajty, and assured Gsrmans in this
country that they would be unmolested as long as they Sehaved them
selves. Orders were issued soon afterward for the arrest if. sixty ring
leaders in German plots and intrigues.
. ARMY PLANS AWAIT CONGRESS.
Complete mobilization of the navy, calling all reserves and militia to
the colors, was ordered by Secretary Daniels, as soon aith war reso
fution was signed. The war ! department, already having taken virtually
! every step contemplated before the
ied, waits on congress. Secretary Baker conferred with Chairman Dent
of the house military committee and arranged to appear before the com
mittee tomorrow to discu&s the general staff army plans and consider the
war budget of more .than .three .bil-lions.
The President went over the great
preparatory measures with the cabi-
net, discussing what has been accom-depart-
plished and dwelling, it is understood.
upon arrangements for co-operation
with the entente allies. Plans for co-
operation are said to have taken de-
finite shape though there will be no
announcement ton the subject for the
present. The seizure of German ships
laid up in American harbors was the
subject of interested comment and le
gal officiars of the government began
consideration of the question of
whether the United States can confis
cate the ships outright or must pay
for them after the war.
Captured Ships Invaluable
In any event, as soon as tney can
be made seaworthy, the fine merchant
fleet thus acquired will give America
a merchant marine that rtmld not be
duplicated in several years and add
more than 600,000 to the tonnage
available for the transportation of
supplies and munitions to the allies.

"which each of our enemies regards,

Count von Reventlow finds that the

Bracken directed for William Fox,

rounding up this number of red men
for work in the film, and the. chase
consumed the greater part of .twe
weeks. j
Mr. Ross's first plan was to get his ;
material from the Onandaga Reserva
tion in Syracuse, X. Y. He made a
person.-'.I trip to the place, and had a
long conference with Chief Isaacs,
head of the tribe, but was finally
forced to give ut) the project.
Their iwas only one thing left to
doinJ 'Ross did it. He made jour

agencies he could find, and rounded
up hi? men by twos and threes. Only
after several days spent at this work
was he able to get enough to give a

encampment that- was needed for the
film. , I

EAR 10 REPORTERS
LONDON", April 6. Lloyd George
today gave t"j the American newspa
per correspondents, on behalf of the
British government.' the following
statement:
"America has at one bound become
a world power in a sense she never
was before. She waited until she
found a cause. Worthy of her traditions.
The American people held back until
they were fully convinced the fight
was not a sordid scrimmage for power
and possessions but an unselfish strug
gle to overthrow a sinister conspiracy
against human liberty and ' human
rights.
"Once that conviction was reached
the great republic of the west has I
leaped into the arena and she stands
ntw side by side with the European
democracies who, bruised and bleed
ing after three years of grim conflict,
are still fighting the most savage foe
that ever menaced the freedom of the
world. i
"The glowing phrases of President
Wilson's noble deliverance illumine
the horizon and make clearer than
ever the goal. we are striving to reach.
"There are three phrases wqich will
:U;n J 'jut forever in the story of cru
rade ihe first is that 'the world must
be safe for democracy,' the next, 'the
uenace to peace and freedom lies in
the existence of autocrtic government
backed by organized force, which is
controlled wholly by their will and not
by tile will of their people, and the
crowning phrase is that in which he
'eels res that 'a steadfast concert for
peace can never be maintained except
'v partnerships of democratic na-
"These words represent the faith
which inspires and sustains our people
in the tremendous sacrifices they have
made and are still making. They
also believe that the unity and peace
of mankind can only rest upon democ
racy, upon the right of those who sub
rait to authority to have a voice in
their town government; upon respect
for the rights and liberties of nations
both great and small and upon the uni
versal dominion of public right.
"To all these the Prussian military
autocracy is an implacable foe. '
"The imperial war cabinet, repre
sentative of all of the peoples of the
British empire, wish me on their be
half to recognize the chivalry and
courage which call the people of the
United States to dedicate the whole of
their resources to the greatest cause
that ever engaged human endeavor.
RUSSIAN MARTYRS
OF FREEDOM BURIED
WITH HIGH HONORS
PETROGRAD. April 5, (via London)
The victims of the revolution were
colemnly buried today in the historic
Field of Mars. As thu corns draped in
scarlet bunting, were lowered one by
one into the tremendous grave that
had been dug in a corner of the field,
a series of salutes one for each vic
tim boomed across the ice-bound
Xeva, from the fortress of St. Peter
and SL Paul, where the last ministers
of the fallen empire are confined.
Regimental bands flanked the square
field and thousands of persons joined
in a mass for the dead.
The sombre aspect of the city was
relieved by innumerable flags and
streamers of flaming red, some of
which -were edged with black bands
of mourning. Banners of every de-
scription bearing the familiar devices
f the new republic, were carried by
each pedestrian. Each column bore the
bodies of the victims who had lived
in their district of the city.
The tremendous funeral cortege
wended its way thrVmgh a city almost
empty of spectators. Virtually every
woman and every child who was able
to walk marched in the procession.
Perfect order prevailed. Stores were
closed and all traffic ceased.

Saturday Morning, April 7, 1917
This idea of raising Uncle Sam's army through the
regular channels bas a broad appeal particularly be
cause it is based upon the idea of selecting the leaders
from those efficient in military affairs rather than e(T
cient in civil life or politics.
There are a few men willing to raise a big uait of
volunteers who undoubtedly are qualified to be leader,
in America's new "army possibly Colonel Roosevelt and
some of his aides, included but it does not follow that
all business leaders are competent to lead a body of men
in war. '
Undoubtedly the war department will find satisfactory
places for all these volunteer leaders perhaps in othct
capacities in wfiich they could serve their country even
better than in the trenches in France. Undoubtedly, too
these men will be just as willing to serve in such capa
cities. .The very fact that they are willing to go and
fight shows they will do their "bit" no matter what the
government specifies it shall be. And they will do er
gladly.
There is need of those with such fighting spirit right
now as witness the number who rather invite the ser
vice which, because of their trade, may keep them at
home.
All can't be industrial soldiers, manufacturing tho
weapons of death; the vital need is for fighting men, and
every man who can be spared from the industrial work
should jump at the chance 'of fighting in battle.
There is a peculiar sentiment often expressed amon
certain classes here of late, that the rich men shou'd
be in the first line of trenches. Such expressigns are
not typical of Americans. The burden ef this war should
and must fall equally upon the shoulders of all no just
American wants another to die by duty that rests equally
upon all, that he may live. Then further, the hypothesis
of these slackers. is wrong.
The rich and poor always have fought American bat
tles with equal loyalty. The heaviest burden naturally
will fall upon laborers, because they are in the greater
number. But the ranks of the others will be just as
thinned after this war.
"War is agreat leveler" and the distinctions which
have been held up to criticism in peace, will disappear
in was many of them permanently.
The European nations in this war for instance, have
advanced socially by strides that in peace might take
generations to accomplish.
RETREATING TO VICTORY.
It has no doubt been good military tactics for the Ger
mans to shorten their line in northern France. Von Hin
denburg knew precisely what he was doing, and in a
general way the retirement seems to have been accom
plished pretty successfully according to program. But an
observer can't help being amused by the explanations
given out from Berlin.
We have an entirely new outlook, and a new set of
phrases. The German nation has been assured that the
army is ''retreating to victory." It is a novel notion,
difficult one would think to "put over" on a nation fed
for three years with the doctrine that there was no vic
tory except in advancing. But it succeeds. The nation
obediently bails the victorious retirement as. the tu
preme Hindeuburg triumph.
"We are now getting the enemy out of their trenches,"
boasts one of the "high German military authorities."
Which is quite true. It is true also that the Geruiaus
have got themselves out of their trenches at the sanic
time, and that the enemy is overjoyed to get out of his
trenches for so pleasant a purpose as pursuing retreating
Germans. , .
The German general staff is jubilaut over liaviug "dis
couraged the British and French campaign plans." That
is to say. the plans laid for driving the Germans out of
that territory are foiled by the Germans' voluntary with
drawal. The sober New York Times, apropos of this reason
, log,- remiirks:
"According to this theory, the Gcrmaus can discomfit
the Britbli greatly by retiring to Berlin. Such a theory
has never been put forward with such tolciuoity fiucc
Juliu Phoenix related how he overcame his cucuiy by
throwing Mniself down on his back and pulling the en
emy dou on Vup of liiu:"
ARGENTINIANS IN OUR NAVY.
Twelve young officers of the Argentine navy recently
came to the United States to spend a year here perfect
ing their professional training. Finding that war was
imminent, and they would have a chance to get into
action, ten of them immediately enlisted under the
Stars and Stripes. Three will serve on battleships, four
on submarines and the other three in the aviation corps.
These men, it should be understood, have acted with
the consent of their own government. That means
something, in view of the fact that there has been a per
sistent effort to persuade this country that Argentine
is pro-German. Their example will no doubt be followed
by hundreds of other military officers in various Latin
American countries.
' The present situation offers them excellent opportuni
ties to learn present-day warfare in the effective school
f experience. It enables them, too, to fight for the demo
ratic ideals common to all the American republics.
They realize that, in bearing arms along with their Yan
kee neighbore, they are battling for their own liberties
.nd their own national existence.
Our government and people should welcome all such
recruits as warmly as our own volunteers have been
welcomed in Ftance.
SAVING FARMERS $100,000,000.
It will be a new experience, and a pleasant one, for
the farmers of the United States to get loans at S per
ent That rate has been fixed by the federal farm loan
'iard to prevail throughout the country rerardles f
'oral rates In tthe different sections It Is hirfcer-tMi
he rates paid for similar loans in most foreign coun
tries, but so much lower than our farmers have been ac
customed to that it comes as a godsend,
e present avera-e interest rate in the United Stntes
"'d to be 7.4 per cent. It Is estimated that whsn the
vm ?eH into eod n;n"iur order .merVan farmer'
vave $100,000,000 a year in inte-es 'hfr-es. T'1"
ft ravin? will be in the WcFt ind Sbuth, where the
new rate just about cuts the old one in two.
Mr-n:r with this boon the farmers will cf course hare
fct advantage of letting their loans run anywhere r-in
ve to forty years and of pay'n; off the principal in an
nual installments if they choose. Both the low interest
rate and the liberal time conditions ought to be effective
'mmediateiy in starting a wave of agricultural expan
sion in this country.

PASSING ON THE TORCH. '
It must be a source of pride to every American th-
ve Un!ted States was first union? the nations of Vhe
world to give recognition to the Russian revolutionary
T-crnment That act waa in harmony with the best
traditions of the American people. '
Our country is quick, as a rule, to welcome any ac--esslon
to the. ranks of democracy in any quarter of the
world, but seldom have we had so fortunate an oppo'
1 nity and taken such fine advantage of it. The exan
le we set has already been followed by "most of the
mportant powers. If the provisional government con
t'nues in the wise, strong and humane policy it his
hown so far, it will soon be recognized by all but Rus
sia's enemies.
The Russian people will never forget the high com
pliment paid them by our prompt and warm hand-clasp
of international fellowship.' It will remain a great event
'n Russian history almost as great, perhaps, aa was
the recognition of our infant republic by France. Future
-enerations of Russians will learn of it with gratitude.
It is a new and, let us hops, a lasting pledge of friend
ship. For( our part, we have merely done Our duty and
passed on the torch of liberty to another great people.
Perhaps the Russian nation will in its turn have the sat
isfaction some day of passing it on to some scill newer
democracy. '
KANSAS BACK YARDS.
This home-gardening business, after all, may have two
sides to it. No doubt it's fine for the Individual and tli ."
community to raise a profusion of vegetables in the
back yard. But like poultry raising, it may have ita dis
advantages. There is a story they tell in Kansas. A citizen of a
Kansas town who was fond of pumpkin pie decided to
cut the cost of living by planting pumpkins. The vines
grew so luxuriously that they spread all over his own
yard and then proceeded to sprawl over adjacent lots
and clamber up neighboring porches and choke up the
surrounding streets and alleys. '
It was fine for the neighbors, in a way. They helped
themselves freely to the pumpkins that trespassed ou
their own property. And yet the vines were a nuisance.
This year, it is said, they sent a petition to the town coun
cil askiug that the guilty citizen be forbidden to grow
garden stuff. The petition was withdrawn only on the
condition that be should build a high, tight wire fence
arouud bis lot to keep his crops within bounds.
A strauge story, mates! But that was in Kansas,
where agricultural marvels are the normal thing. It
can't be used as a valid argument against tho plantiug of
garden seeds in the back yard by ordinary Americans
tit lug iu ordinary states.
The mobilization of the National Guard in most of the
states last year was a work of difficulty, confusion aud
delay. Now it goes like clockwork. The guardsmen are
veterans. Their Mexican experience was valuable train
ing iu preparation for more Important service.
Out of 4.000 graduates of the Mustat uubctts Institute of
Technology who Lave replied to a request for eorolluicnt
for ecial services for war. ouly eight have refused to
put themselves at their country's service. If the same

became excited. He waved his arms
around like a windmill, glared at the
judge and then proceeded to execute
what looked to be a crss between a
Siauu se war dance and an tpiliptic
fit, taking in the greater part of the
court room with this "testimony."
Judge Thomas looked at the interpre
ter in amazement.
"He says he attacked the three men
beat them up and then took the gun
away from them," said the latter,
without the trace of a smile.
The court was convinced.
"Tell him that he is the best mov
ing picture acior I have ever seen,"
said Judge Thomas. "And tell htm
: also that he has the best imagination
J I have ever encountered."
When this was translated to Villa
; he snickered for half a minute and
then (Started to "talk" again. But the
judge interrupted him and to'd him
tiirt, as he did not actually have the
gun in his possession when arrested,
t'.p case against him was dismissed.

HEAT WITH
Foreign-born Woman, Convicted
nf nesetratinft Flat. Promises
To Respect Old
There probably is no stauncher pat
liot in the Warren District today than
Mary Raginovich, a native of Austria
unless, perhaps, it be C. M. Gregovich
who was born in Scrvia. This state
ment may sound strong, but anyone
who was in city court late yesterday
afternoon will verity it. The story of
these two patriots is a rather stormy
one, but it has an ending that should
be an inspiration to every foreign
born resident.
Miss Raginovich and Gregovich are
next-door neighbors. Wednesday
evening they became involved in a
heated argument that developed Into
a physical encounter. Each tells a
uitt'erent story. Gregovicn claims
tnat he started to put an American
flag over his door and that the woman
cursed him and the flag, accused him
of being a spy and finally grabbed
the flag from hiin and tore it in two.
The Serbian declares he slapped the
woman for her act and would have
treated her worse were it not for the
fact that she was a woman.
Complaint Issued
Miss Raginovich dtnies this story
She claims that she and Gregovich
were struggling for possession of the
flag and that Gregovich was the one
who tore it in an attempt to take the
flag away from her.
Wednesday evening Gregovich told
L:-ut. Fred C. Wright, First Arizona
Infantry, of the incident ani the of

court charging the woman with dese
crating and reviling the American
flag. The court room was filled with
spectators yesterday afternoon when
the case was tried.
Both Gregovich and Miss Ragino
vich were both considerably excited
during the trial, and the woman was
so vociferous in her denial Of the
charge that she was frequently forced
to sit down in herx'hair and keep qui
et. The preponderance of evidence
was against her and Judge Thomas
fined ber J300 and sentenced her to
serve six months in the city jai.
All Ends Happily
"Owing to the fact, that you are a
woman." said Judge Thomas. "I will
suspend the sentence and remit the
fine; but only on condition that you
take this flag home, mend it carefully
and always respect it. It is your jag
as long as you are in this country and
you must always respect it."
The woman sprang forward, folded
the tattered flag in her arms and
cried:
"Oh Judge, I do love it, I do love it.
It's the best flag in the world."
And. still crying her love for the
lai, she danced out of the room and
' urried home to men it and hang it

COPENHAGEN, April 6, (via

Austria Hungary and Turkey will
remain neutral for the nresent at

Looking Forward
to Motherhood
Well Known Preparation
Keves Much Snfferin?.
Re-
The freatest crisis in the life of a
woman is when she becomes a mother.
All be- physical strength is taxed to
the limit at such a time. It is neces
sary that she prepare her system for
4m great event in order to preserve
her future health. j
Thousands of mothers have placed
tale reliance upon "Mother's Friend." 1
Ibis preparation is applied externally ;
wd is eetnpoaed of special penetrat
ing, softening oirs which prepare the
noseles and tendons for the unusual
train. Naturally the tendency is to
relieve th pain and danger at the
crisis, leaving the mother in a healthy
condition. -
The expectant mother should pro
nrre a bottle o "Mother's Friend"
from her drngirist, apply it night and
morn in j:, and after beprmicjr its use, '
write for free book for users. Much
practical information is contained in
it Just address Bradfield Regulator
Company, Dept. II 394 Atlanta, Ga,
and the hook will be mailed to you at
It . . I : x l! S
FIVE BILLION FOR
1 FIRST YEAR OF WAR
(Continued From Page One)
of the issue.
Radical revision of the present In
come tax is considered as among the
probabilities of the war revenue
measure to be placed before congress.
This revision probably will concern
both extremes of the scale, involving
the lowering of the preseat exemption
of $3,000 and $4,000 in individual In
comes of $25,000 and over.
The opinion prevails among mem
bers of the ways and means commit
tee that the government'? revenue
from this source alone could be
brought without undue hardship to
anyone up to $1,000,000,000 annually
and possibly more. The income tax
at present rates will yield appicxi
mately $325,000,000
Revision of the excess profits tax
likewise seems certain. The present
measure, which allows an exemption
of $50,000 and taxes net earnings of
corporations in excess of eight per
cent annually at the rate of eight pel
cent is designed to yield $226,000,000
annually. Experts have recently hee:i
studying somewhat similar methods
of taxation in Great Britain and
France and a parallel measure in ef
fect in Canada which imposes taxes
up to 25 percent on net earnings.
One estimate is that the govern
ment could obtain $1,000,000,000 annu
ally from this source. Other propos
als included increased taxation on
whiskey, beer and tobacco and revis
ion of the estates tax.
BERLIN SCORNS PEACE
AMSTERDAM, via. London. April 6.
A dispatch to the Handclsblad from
Berlin quotes the Vossiche Zeitung
as leclaring that the meeting of the
German and Austir.n monarchs and
statesmen at German headquarters
does not justify rumors of ew peace
offers.
i "The Vossiche Zeitung even asserts
.that Great Britain made a suggestion
(of peace negotiations through Austria
jto Germany, but it adds that Great
j Britain's strength is still unbroken
and that such a suggestion should be
viewed with great distrust."
