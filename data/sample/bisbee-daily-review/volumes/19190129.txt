Belgians to Report Next
Gen. Jan Christian Smuts, the South
African leader, and Gen. Louis Botha,
the South African premier, already
have been heard on the question or
German East Africa, and now it only
remains to obtain the viewpoint ot
the Belgians who are about to present
their ideas of 'their interests in the
colonies adjacent to Belgian colonies.
It appears to be the generally ac
cepted views among those having in
terests ia the matter that Germany's
colonies should not be returned to
her.
This in turn has developed another
crucial question, namely whether Ger
man sovereignty over these colonies
should pass to the powers who may
receive them or whether they should
be entrusted to a league of nations
which would exercise international
control while giving a mandate to
such powers as administer the par
ticular colonies.
Consider Larger Problem
This larger question, affecting the
senenu aununistration or tne colonies.
was considered by the council today.
as well as the particular interests in
volved, and the discussion v ill bo con
tinued tomorrow morning.
German East Africa is the most im
portant territorial possession involved,
as it has upward of 7.000,000 inhabi

PREACHER FACES
MURDER CHARGES
(By Review LfasJ Wil-e) I
SACO, Maine, Jan. 2S. The state's '
case against Henry H. Hall, a lay
preacher, charged with having beaten
and choked his wife before throwing
her from a railroad bridge into a shal
low brook, resulting in her death the
next day, was outlined to the jury by j
uie yruseLuuou louay. me seiecuuu
of a jury occupied only two hours.
Two cf the state's witnesses were
heard.
Much stress was laid by the prose
cutor on what he termed Hall's indis
cretions with several women while
pastor of a church at Wells Depot. He
said witnesses would testify that the
preacher had . been warned by mem
bers of the parish to be more careful
in his conduct.
It would be shown further, it was
stated, that Hall had remarked to sev
eral persons that he did not intend to
go through life with a sick wife on
his hands
Ernest J. Matthews, a railroad sec- j
tion .foreman, testified to having seen
Hall near the bridge on June 11.
He said Hall told him his wife lost
her balance and had fallen to the
rocks in the middle of the brook and
that Hall did not show any signs of
grief.

likely to be reduced by increased con

Europe following several years of

the United States is expected to give
an exportable surplus of 330,000.000 to

Following the appointment of T. O.

man of the Armenian relief fund,
which includes aid for the Jews, Syri
ans and other peoples of the Near
East, it became evident yesterday that
the campaign for the raising cf $35,

with a swing that will carry it over
the top in short order.
Mr. McGrath was busy yesterday
laying plans for the campaign, choos
ing his assistants and otherwise lay
ing the groundwork for a red hot
workout in the name of world charity.
"When interviewed last nisht, the
county chairman said he had not de

plan of campaign, its duration and
other features of public interest.

It is the desire of the local com

on the same night, this being the one
feature for causing naming of a def

be secured, but whether on the same

The matter was discussed Monday
night by a committee composed of
J. G. Potter, J. L. Denton, R. O. Owen

decided to renew the challenge and
urge that both games be arranged for
the same day and as early as possible.

Hard to
Two different .dispatches in the news yesterday morning on the con
duct of the government in disposition "of men who for the past year
have been held in prisons and detention camps, offer two divergent
views which are hard to reconcile.
The first dispatch, from Leavenworth, Kans., tells of the discharge
from a government penitentiary of conscientious objectors, honorably
reinstated, paid in full, and restored to rank in the army.
. The second dispatch, from Salt Lake City, Utah, tells of the re
lease from a detention camp of two interned Germans, on condition that
they return to Germany immediately.
Conscientious objectors have been the greatest object of ridicule in
the men who have been drafted into the United States army. In camps
they have caused , more trouble and greater lack of discipline than any
one other class. They have received from the public nothing but con
demnation.'. When it was announced they would be court martialed and
sent to prison, the public applauded. They went to the military deten
tion houses, the objects of public disapproval.
The second class did not meet with public, scorn. Interned aliens
were regarded by the public as enemies of the nation. Lecause they were
Germans and proud of it, the public resented , their freedom, and they
were incarcerated because they were dangerous.
But the feeling of the layman when he heard of the interning of con
scientious objectors was entirely different than his emotions when he
read of the detention of alien enemies. The fact that the conscientious
objector generally was a citizen of the United States dictated the dif
ferent emotions. The scorn of the one, was contrasted with the hatred
of the other; the one was put up to view as a man who would not fight,
the other as a dangerous fighter. -
Why, then, should the conscientious objector, convicted before a mili
tary court and sentenced to prison, receive any different treatment than
the interned German? At the most, should not his punishment be equal
to that of the alien enemy?
Why, after he has refused to fight, after he has refused to serve his
government in non-combatant capacities, should he be returned to the
rank and file of civilians with the same honorable discharge, the same
status, as the man who has dared the dangers of German barbarism on
the battle fields of Europe?
It is hard' to conceive the man who refused to bear arms for his
country, standing on the same plane as the man who endured months
of hardships in the army. ,
Her First
The first woman elected to serve In the New York assembly was
regarded with the amount of suspicion and curiosity inevitable to her new
position, and a very ljvely interest wasfelt regarding the first legis
lative measure which she might propose.
At last it was presented. The fateful moment arrived. And what
was the bill? Was it to provide that every cannery in New York be
fitted with lace curtains and carpets, or to insure that no man retain a
job which any woman wants? Neither! She introduced a bill to ex
tend the open season for duck snooting! And there Is this evidence
of common Interest in the subject it was opposed by only two votes.
Probably those two men don't like duck, anyway.
Women will, of course, look to the interest of children and of female
employes. . That Is .not because the men have neglected them, but be
cause until everything has been done that should be, it is everybody's
duty to help. ,
Nobody would have . been surprised that a man should introduce
a bill in interest of sport, or of game protection. Any one who is sur
prised at a woman's doing it belongs with those old-timers who think
Standard Time is Ungodly because it is not based on sunrise in Podunk:
As women become more familiar figures in our legislative bodies
it will develop that after all their Interests are no more opposed to those
of men in politics than in family life, hysterical antics to the contrary
notwithstanding. Tucson Star.
Presidents
The estate of $500,000 left by Theodore Roosevelt is a very moderate
fortune by New York standards, but for a president one of unusual size.
It ranks Mr. Roosevelt indeed, as probably the country's richest chief
executive since Washington, and the fact has a suggestive interest. Many
a ruler of a petty republic has become a multi-millionaire, but no mil
lionaire has ever been president of the world's greatest and richest
republic, and this notwithstanding the altered scale of personal wealth"
under which the comparative magnitude of an accumulation of 11,000,000
has decreased- '
The Roosevelt fortune was different, moreover, in being mainly an
inherited fortune. Its possessor may have added to it In his lifetime, but,
as in the case of other presidents, most of his personal earnings in a
period of 40 years of public life! were absorbed in the support of his
family. No other president has ever enjoyed such advantages of re
munerative publicity as Mr. Roosevelt, and besides his salary from of
ficial positions his income from his books and from editorial work must
have been large. Yet it is a fair inference that If theser had been the
sole sources of his support he would have died a poor man, as Cleveland
died, and also most of their predecessors in the White House.
This has been the common financial fate of presidents, and the ex
ample of Mr. Roosevelt probably merely proved the rule that the. office
of president is not economically productive in any logical proportion to
Its exalted state and onerous political qualifications. New York World.
A Trade in
Utah's recently re-opened negotiations with Arizona for the acquisi
tion of "that part of this state lying north of the Grand Canyon, runs
against one obstacle which its predecessors did not encounter the aero
plane. If all the dreams come true and many of the dreams about
planes have been realized, and then some, it will not be long before every
ranchman and rangeman will be the owner of an aeroplane, a legiti
mate successor of the Ford, with which he can scorn the Grand Canyon
and Lee's Ferry. "
As the Ford has annihilated rural distances, so will the coming aero
plane annihilate that mighty gash in the earth made by nature, or Cap
tain John Hance.
It will, we suppose, be a long time before cattle can be carried to
market over aerial highways eo that trans-canyon traffic will have to be
carried on through Utah, but the settler can reach his county seat at
Flagstaff or Kingman with his tax money and then in most cases he
would be flying light. There are lots of machines now in use that
would easily carry ills load.
The latest Utah proposition carries something new, a proffer of the
exchange of San Juan county for scraps of two of our counties. In the
end, in pcint of .numbers, we w&uld be the gainer, emerging from the
deal with fifteen counties whereas wc now have only fourteen. Arizona

what was termed by delegates the
keystone resolution of the session

The convention adjourned to meet
in Tucson next year.
Side by side with this action went
three other resolutions, one favoring
the establishment of an unsalaried
state highway commission to direct
the construction of a system of roads
and a second recommending increas
ing the present 10 per cent road tax
to meet available federal road and
forest road funds thus to take care
of the unemployment problem, and a
third urging county action in highway
building.
Fear Political Intrigue.
The resolution urging the establish
ment of a commission to direct the
6tate highway department brought out
considerable discussion, the burden
of the debate being that the delegates
feared politics in the naming of the
members and their subsequent activ
ities. . This point finally was cleared
when an amendment carried provid
ing that, in the event of its establish
ment, the commission's members
should serve without salaries. The
resolution suggested that five com
missioners be appointed by the gov
ernor with the consent of the state
senate, not more than three of whom
at any time should be members of
the same political party. Five-year
terms were suggested for the corn-
missioners. while it was expressly '
stipulated that members of the same i
political party should not be appoint-1

terminated in favor of Bennett, the de
fendant, who was awarded S20.
In tlie superior court, however, the
jury today returned a verdict of ?74."7
in favor of the plaintiff Ward and a
supplemental verdict in the some
amount in favor of the defendant Ben
nett. Immediately the question arose as
to who should hear the court costs.
The plaintiff contended that inasmuch
as a judgment for the amount ho
claimed had been returned in his fav

of costs. The defendant put forth a

SEALEV PROPOSES
MINERS HOSPITAL
(My Review Leaded Wire)
PHOENIX, Ariz., Jan. 28. A bill to
revise the entire school system of the
state was introduced in the senate to
day by Senator Hicks, the measure be
ing captioned senate bill No. 27.
The bill purports to embody the re
commendations of the state commis
sion on education and it is stated in
the lobbies of the legislature that con
siderable controversy is expected over
the proposed legislation. It is pointed
out that argument is almost certain
to arise from the fact that there have
been two commissions appointed un
der the act providing for a comiuis
ison, the first named by Governor
Campbell when he was acting as de
facto governor and another appointed
by Governor Hunt when he returneu
to office.
Conflict of Opinion
State Superintendent of Education
C. O. Case states that the report of the
commission transmitted by the gover
nor is not the report of his commis
sion, although, he says, the copy sent
to Senator Hicks so states. The bill
is the most ponderous that has been
introduced in either house. It is con
tained on 70 typewritten pages.
Hospital for Miners
Representative Sealey introduced in
the house a bill providing for the es
tablishment of a state hospital for
!miner3 anrt making an appropriation j
of $-50,000 for that purpose. The mea- i
sure PrPs,-'s to create a commission j
of three to be named uv llle gover-;
nor' t0 select and purchase a site, or j
t0 accePt a Bift of a site in the name j
of the state.

end of the war, when Maj. James
Douglas left France, he was in charge
of the transportation system of the
Ke Cross.
With the departure of

store system or uie organisation.
In this work he was aided, by the
way. by Capt. Tom Colins, formerly
with the C. & A. company in this city,
but now a resident of Michigan.

Major Brophy electrified his hear-
I ers by his description of the American
ril in France, 'particular!- as ex-
mplified by the semi-civilian at
taches cf the army during the gloomy
days of last spritig when each day
! brought discouraging news of the ad
vance of the Germans toward Paris.
Re! using the counsel of the French
officials, who wished to nave the Red
Cross stores removed from the en
dangered French capital, the major
iMid many others were ready to go
out and fight, if need he, to save the
city from the boche.
ou know, the first battle. of the
Manie in 1914 was won by rushing
ecry man able to carry a gun out of
Paris to meet the boche. They held
hi ni. Well, there wore a lot of us in
Paris ready to duplicate the trick.
We were slightly superanuated, as far
as active service went,, but we were
ready to make a try jit it. anyway.

ran into a bunch of British troops,
retreating, and so lagged out with

MANY CATTLEMEN TO

By Review Leased Wirt)
PHOENIX. Ariz.. Jan. 28. Chamber
of Commerce officials announced to
day that they expect 500 cattlemeu
from all parts of the state to attend
the annual convention of the Arizona
Cattlemen's association, which will
open its sessions here February 11.
Chamber of Commerce officials point
out the increasing importance of this
organization which is stated to repre
sent livestock in Arizona whose as
sessed valuation jumped from $22,000.

dow so that the people here may study
each separate piece.
"Following the American advance
and again in a trip made in December
to Belgium, I had an opportunity to
study closely the terrifie damage
wrought by the boche to the captive
territory. Our own artillery, perforce,
in order to overmatch the Germans,
had to batter down forests, towns and
to practically destroy cultivated' fields.
Where fighting had been intense the
walls of towns would be almost level
ed, only a few empty shells standing
to mark the former living place of
thousands of prosperous people. I saw
Albert, where the artillery lire had
been so heavy that even the dead had
been blasted from their graves in the
cemetery. Meziers, a strong point
which offered stubborn resistance to
the Yanks in their advance, also was
leveled. This was an important rail
way center and its fall marked the be
ginning of the end for the boche.
"Strange to say, when I reached
Metz, I found food plentiful, in spite
of stories reaching us that, the Ger
mans were starving.
France Begins Farming
"In December, when 1 made a trip
through Flanders, to Ypres, Lille and
into Belgium. I had a chance to ob
serve the terrible destruction, as well
as to see what the French govern
ment was doing to re-estabHsh its peo
ple on the land. Of course in the em
nattle area where there u:is srs rep
ly space to stand a house so well had
the earth been plowed up by shells
and the subsoil thrown up in great
hummocks, rapidly becoming over
grown by weeds. No agriculture was

COURT CONSIDERS
GLOBE FLU CASES
tlly Review Leased Wire)
PHOENIX, Ariz., Jan. 2S. Argu
ments have been concluded in the
state supreme court on what are
known briefly and familiarly as the
Globe "Hu cases," and decision now
is being awaited.
These two actions, the Globe City
Health Board vs. Charles Alden and
the Globe School Board vs. the Globe
Health Board, arising, out of the ac
tion of the health board in closing
schools, theaters and other public
places during the influenza epidemic
have attracted considerable comment
in law circles at the capital. Lacking
precedents in law to follow, the Judges
are carefully studying the arguments
and authorities submitted, first by the
health board against the Alden theater
and then by the school board against
the health board for ordering the clos
ing of the institutions of learning.
. The cases were considered of such
urgency .they were placed before oth
ers on the calendar at the urgent tele
graphic pleas of the attorneys engaged.
j were finished the American casualties
j easily would reach 300,000. However
j the official list from Washington
j places the total much lower and that,
after all, is what we must be governed
bv.
In speaking of the conditions he had
found to obtain as. late as December
in recaptured territory in Alsace Lor
raine. Major Brophy said that rail
communication was non-existent. The
inhabitants were on a strict govern
ment ration, all supplies being hauled
in camions by the French for the civil
ian population. Destruction of rail
road bridges by the boche in his re
treat made it seem certain that many
months must pass before they could
be rebuilt.
Red Cross Endina Work

the time he left France to wind up the
affairs of the Red Cross in France by
March at the latest, insofar as a cen
ter of supply was coneernpd Sinh
j part of the supplies as might be neces-
saiy io tne immediate welfare of
France would be distributed among
the people by the rrcfects of the va
rious villages. This would include
numerous hospital units, the beds and
furniture from which will afford the
people an opportunity to re-establish
semblance of home life in some locali
ties. .Much of the Red Cross impedi
mentia will be removed to the Balkans
where there is urgent need for it and
there have -been reports recently that
some will be sent to Russia to aid the
starving population.
In speaking of the aftermath of the
war. Major Brophy said no rapid re
juvenation of the nations involved
might be expected at this time, par
ticularly in view of the incomplete
ness of peace negotiations, "until
peace has been concluded, there will
be small chance to rehabilitation on
a large scale being undertaken," 'he
said.
Relative to the situation in the Uni
ted Sattes, Major Brophy expressed an
optimistic view, saying that while a
period of dullness naturally must fol
low the closing of the war and demo
bilization of the army, it will not be
long before the national elasticity re
asserts itself and the business world
be rejuvenated.
Major Brophy reached Los Angeles
January 7 this year, joining his wife
there a year and three months to the
day after his departure from Bisbee.
The major is looking well and as hara
as the proverbial nails.
Follow ing his arrival here yesterday
afternoon, he began to pick up the
threads of his Arizona interests, mak
ing a brief trip to Douglas in company
with M. J! Cunningham, and returning
several hours later.

! ' GRAIN MARKET.
! CHICAGO, Jan. 28. Correct antici-
ration that the February minimum
daily average price of hogs would be
reduced from the January level
brought about radical upturns today
in the value of corn. The market
' closed unsettled, 2 to 4 cents net
higher, with May $1.194 to $1.19V
and July $1.16i4 to $1.16. "
Oats gained to 2 cents and pro-
visions finished unchanged to an ad-
vance of $1.
Although formal action as to the
hog price minimum had not been
taken at Washington while the board
of trade here was in session, the great
majority of dealers expected the old
I Mure to be maintained, and they load-
i ed ud with corn. Much of the flyman 1
represented covering by snorts, but
there was also considerable invest-
ir.ent bv.yinc
Meantime, it was con-
ce-Iel ou all sides that the market of
'ate had been depressed far below the
January hog basis, as well as to a 1
point where Argentine corn was no
longer cheap. The bulge that re
sulted sent the market up 6 cents in
seme cases. Owing to delay of the
Washington conference in reaching a
settlement, however, the extrema ad
vance was not. all held.
I Oats ascended with corn.
In provisions, the active deliveries
rose to the maximum limit for a
j single day.
