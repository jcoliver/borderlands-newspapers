(Special to the Review.)
AJO. Ariz.. July 5. As a result of a
meeting of business men who formed
an oreanization known as the Citizens
and Property Holders' Association of
the Ajo Mining District, whose pur
pose Is to stand firmlv behind the riV
ernmentand to establish and maintain
concord in the great centers of produc
tion that -are so necessary for the suc
cess of the munition output, the Work
men's Loyalty league was formed this
morning at a mass meeting held In the
New Cornelia Copner company's plant.
The enthusiasm exhibited proved that
loyaltv to the government far exceed
ed the selfish, personal desire of the
aeitators that are in the ramn attempt
ing to formulate a strike In whirh the
hand of the alien enemy is shown. The
anpeal to . the workers will be flistrlc:
wide. All the people of the camp are
of the opinion that if the workers are
dissatisfied it was not discovered until
a delecation of I. W. W. representa
tives visited the camp.
The workers here want to decide
questions of sueh Importance for them
selves and among tberrselvs. Thev
say that thev are th'nneh with minor

were accounted for at the meeting
within the plant and it is reported on

PHOENIX. July 5. Former Gover
nor G. V. P. Hunt may go to Globe to
act as the personal representative of
President Wilson in an effort to set
tle the strike situation there and else- i
where throughout Arizona.
Former Governor Hunt is in receipt j
of a telegram from President Wilson,
in which the president says:
"I have been very much concerned '
to hear of the possible serious misua-1
derstanding between the miner3 and '
operators in the copper mines and I
would deem it a very great public ser- 1
vice on your part if you would be gen
erous enough to do what you could to
act as mediator and conciliator. I
know how confidently I can appeal to
your public spirit."
Ex-Governor Hunt has wired the
president that he is perfectly willing
to act and feels confident that he will
be acceptable to the miners, but
would like to know whether he will
be acceptable to the operators. In an
interview today ex-Governor Hunt
stated that in case be goes to Globe
he will urge upon the men that this is
not a proper time to insist upon their
i demands of recognition of their union
and will appeal to their patriotism not
to attempt to tie up a great industry
upon which the nation is dependent
at this time of need.

Every Defendant Will Be Put
On Stand To Satisfy Jury
That Each Is Innocent, Is
Promise of Counsel.
(By Review Leased Wire).
SAN FRANCISCO. July 5. With a
brief opening statement byHttorney
Maxwell McNutt, the defense today
opened its case in the murder trial of
Mrs. Rena Mooney, which grew out
of the bomb explosion here last July.
Three witnesses were then put on the
stand In an effort to impeach the testi
mony of Mrs. "Nellie Edeau, one of the
state's star witnesses. McNutt said
the defense would prove an alibi for
Mrs. Mooney.
"We will show that Mrs. Mooney
was on the roof of the building in
which she resided instead of at a point
nearer the scene of the explosfon
which state witnesses said they saw
here," declared McNutt. "We will
prove this alibi with witnesses and
photographs."
Announces Defense.
The defense, he . asserted, would
prove further that Warren K. Billings,
under sentence of life imprisonment
for one of the bomb murders, was not
on the roof of a building with a suit
case, as was testified to by Mrs. Es
telle Smith, a state witness.
"We will bMjw that the man with
the suitcase on the top of the building.
4.000 feet away from the explosion,
about half an hour before it occurred,
was Thomas Dodge, a professional pho
tographer." said McNutt. The state
contended that the bomb was contained
in a suitcase and that Billings original
ly had intended t'J launch it from the
top of a building but that lateness in
the starting of the parade caused a
change in the plan.
McNutt said the defense would also
prove that a box of epsom salts found
in the basement of Edward Nolan's
house, one of the defendants in the
bomb cases, was not for use in the
making of explosives, as the state con
tends, but for bathing purposes.

FRENCH FRONT IN FRANCE,
Wednesday. July 4. (Bi 1 HE ASSO
CIATED PRESS )-After their stronir
est offensive since Verdun the G"r
mans found themselves today thrown
back everywhere along an eleven-mile
front on the Chemin des Dames, leav
ing the ground thickly strewn with
their dead and having failed to take
even one French soldier prisoner.
The Germans came forward in the
closest formation and in successive
waves, preceded by the famous "shock'
troops who were mown down by the
French fire.
At the first onslaught in the vicin
ity of Cerny and on the California
plateau the French were obliged to
give way but their yielding was only
momentary and a counter attack rem
edied the slight dent immediately and
in addition gave them possession of
some German trenches in the vicinity
of Cerny, whicJi they held. "
The German infantry appeared to
have all the dasli taken out of them
by the French defense and made no
attempt to regain the lost ground by
the French reaction. The nrtillety
throughout today, however, maintained
a sweeping fire but its effects were
minimized by the enemy's lack cf ob

James li. McClintoc!:, t'le well- I
known newspaper man and so:- :
dier. summed up liis conclusions on
the strike in a remarkably clear and
forceful article for My paper, the El
Pa:4 Herald, in which it appeared
Wednesday evening, as follows:
The big strike in Bisbee is not
an appeal from inadequate wages,
for the local scale lias been 2 cents
higher than in ar:y other mining
caiiip of tiie nation; it is not a pro
test against exccssie labor, for
the miner, under the Arizona laws,
really puts in only about seven
hours; it is not against poor work
ing conditions, for the two leading
companies here " are notable for
the care taken of their men; it is
not for union control, for the local
unions have no voice in the con
duct of the sttike and resent the
intrusion here of a movement by
them deemed antagonistic to their
own interests.
This last point is emphasized by

Today this league numbers six
teen hundred members, every one
of them underground men. Twelve
hundred of them by actual count
marched in the big Fourth of July
parade.
It was the prompt and emphatic
answer of the formation of this
league that struck the fatal blow
at the success of the strike right
at the beginning. The Loyalty
league was formed to pledge sup
port to the government and to af
ford protection to all the men in
this district who wished to work.
The league members argued
that there, was' no cause for a
strike; that no recognized union
labor organization was behind It;
that, in fact, it was an outlaw
both in the eyes of union labor
and the eyes of the average cit
izen and the eyes of the govern
ment. So tJie.y took action. The

of many militarists to the republican

Nevertheless, fear is felt that he will

(By Review Leased Wire.)
WASHINGTON, July a. Convinced
that many desirable men are holding
back their applications for the sec
ond officers' training camp because of
a misconception of the requirements.
Adjutant-General McCain issued a
statement tonight making it clear
that "Intelligent and forceful" men
are wanted even if they are under 31
years of age and without military
training.
General McCain's statement was
given out through the public informa
tion committee with a request that th
newspapers give it prominence. It
follows:
"The statement that mature men
will be given preference for the sec
ond series of officers' training camps
seems to have been misunderstood in
some quarters. This preference will
only apply where qualifications are
equal. There is no intention to bar
cut applications by men under thirty
one. In fact, examining officers have
been instructed to regard the ages of j
25 to 35 as the most suitable. There
is also some misunderstanding about
the necessity of previous military
experience, 'through desirable, is not
strictly necessary."
Applications for these camps will
close on July 15.

AGITATORS ATTEMPT
TO CAUSE STRIKE IN
BIG TEXAS SMELTER
(By Review Leased Wire).
EL PASO. Tex., July 5. Representa
tives of the Industrial Workers of the
World who arrived here yesterday,
made efforts today to get the local
workmen to join the proposed strike
of mine, smelter and allied workers
throughout the southwest. Little head
way was said to have been made.
There is said to be no doubt of the
intention of these men to agitate a
strike here of the industries closely
allied with the copper production in
dustry in the southwest.
The El Paso smelter, the largest in
the southwest, is said to have attract
ed the I. W. W. delegates.
"Obrero Mexican," a Mexican news
paper published here, issued an ap
peal to Mexican mine and smelter
workmen not to have anything to do
with the I. W. W., saying it was a
scheme to get their jobs from them.

showed a healthy increase, in spite of
the fact that it was change day.
Hunt Appointment Uncertain.
The "wobblies" went wild with joy
yesterday when they heard that for
mer Governor G. W. P. Hunt had been
offered the position of conciliator in
Arizona by President Wilson. Around
union (?) headquarters members of
the organization were offering bets of
five to one that if Hunt took the job
every demand of the metal .Workers
would be granted. "Hunt will take
care of us," was the cry of the strike
leaders. But again their belief was
given a jolt, for the former executive
in a statement to a representative of
the Associated Press in Phoenix yes
terday declared that he did not know
whether he would accept the appoint
ment as conciliator ,or not, unless he
was acceptable to the 'operators, and
that if he did he would turn his efforts
toward inducing the men to go to work.
Hunt declared further in this state
ment that he considered it ill-advised
for the strikers to attempt to force
their demands at this critical period.
Circulars, claimed to be issued by
the metal workers and the local
branch of the International Union Vf
Mine, Mill and Smelter Workers, an
nouncing that the international union
would consider all men who continued
to work in the mines unfair, were dis
tributed by the "wobblies" yesterday
in the hope of influencing some of the
men who ignored the I. W. W. Organ
ization to "quit work for fear of being
branded "scabs" by the I. U. of M. M.
& S. W.
This ruse also fell flat, for last night
Charles H. Mover, president of the In
ternational Union of Mine, Mill and
Smelter Workers, made this statement
in Denver: "The Industrial Workers
of the World have gained conti'jl of
our local union at Bisbee and we will
have their charter revoked within -18
hours.
"We assume no responsibility for
the action of that local I believe that
is what I telegraphed Governor Camp
bell and I thought it would be under
stood fpom that what the situation
was.
"We are going to revoke that char
ter just as soon as I can get a man
down there tj check up their book;."
Thus is the only real union organ
ization of miners in. the district, cr.st
out of its family and branded as dis
loyal on act'ount of allowing itself to
become dominated by a roving, unsta
ble gang of agitators who, not recog
nized by any union themselves, g.-ve
vent to their feelings by attempt!:ig
to cowe those who do not bow ij tTirT
will by calling them "scabs." Moycr
has many friends among the miners
of the district and his determined ac
tion in the matter is expected to be
followed by steps that will sever the
real union from the clutches of Lie
labor outlaws.

Deputy Sheriff Percy Bowden
Catches Young Butcher In
The Act. Faces Federal
Pen.
The Fourth ot Juiy wasnt' a very
happy one for L'ouis Bauer, of Dougias,
for It was on Independence Day that
he lost his liberty, according to Deputy
Sheriff Percy Bowden, who was here
yesterday. The day opened up bright
enough for him and kept rosier, for he
was making money. But in the late
afternoon his sun set suddenly and
darkly as he viewed the horizon
through pris'on bars. Yesterday he was
still in jail .and with the penitentiary
doors yawning in his face.
Bauer's downfall came because he
couldn't resist the lure of easy money
profit that comes from selling whis
key in a dry town. He is a yoiyig
butcher and until recently was en
gaged with his brothers in running u
market on lower G avenue, in Doug
las. Some time ago they closed the
market and since then Louis has been
working for the Douglas market and
has also been iu charge of the slaugh
ter house, about two miles from tov. n
on the international line and near the
army camp.
For some time Deputy Sheriff Percy
Bowden has suspected tnat Bauer
selling whiskey to soldiers at the
slaughter house. Wednesday afternoon
with some assistants he lay in wait
near the place and watched soldiers
come and f,V. Then he sent in a sol
dier to buy a bottle of whiskey, which
he succeeded in doing without any
trouble, according to Bowden. The r.r
rest of Bauer followed a few moments
later.
Army Supplies Found.
A search of the place revealed about
three cases of Atherton whiskey and
i a large quantity of supplies that be-
iVmged to the United States army.
There was a sack of ammunition and
a lot of hard tack and other provisions,
such as coffee, pepper, etc., in suffi
cient quantities to last an entire troop
a month. The government property is
said to have been brought there as
payment or security for whiskey t.y
several mesa sergeants of the Seven
teenth infantry. It is reported that a
number 'of arrests were made at t!:e
camp last night as a result of the raid
yesterday.
Bauer was allowed to spend Wednes
day night at his home, due to the ill
ness of his wife. He was guarded by
a deputy sheriff and yesterday pat
baVk in jail. Following his arrest he
was turned over to H. Howe, a special
officer of the department of justice,
and will be prosecuted in the federil
court under the recent act of congress
making It a penitentiary offense i'o sell
or give away liquor to a soldier. He
will be arraigned before U. S. Commis
sioner Beumler. This is the first ar
rest under the new federal act, t it
military officers say it is but the be
ginning of a crusade that it is believed
will soon stamp out tne practice of
selling liquor to soldiers.

CHICAGO GRAINS.
CHICAGO, July 5. Overtopping of
all previous high prices continued in
the corn market today, notwithstand
ing that the record-smashing has been
going on since last Saturday uncheck
ed. Urgency of demand largely was
due to reports that distillers would
be allowed to grind all corn of which
they had ownership July 15. " The
market closed nervous 214 to 2r;i net

514 to 8 cents, closing unsettled, July

ished to 1 up and provisions un
changed to fifteen higher.
Wheat advanced mainly as a result
of the strength of corn. Advices were
at hand that wheat in the southwest
had been adversely affected by hot
winds during the last week and that
the North Dakota crop had suffered
from drought. Very little busness wsgs
done as traders were awaiting devel
opments in regard to government con
trol. Active call from export inter
ests proved a big factor in lifting the
oats markjet Considerable selling that

NEW YORK, July 5. In all depart
. ments extreme weakness developed in
the last hour, on an accurrenoe of a
rather general liquidation inspired
chiefly by the insistent talk of German
peace proposals, were up to this time
lacking of official confirmation. Local
operators recently have been rather
pessimistic as to the markets future
tendencies and todays news increased
their initiative. Labor troubles in
various industries also fostered unfav
orable comment and the conspicuous
slackening in the public demand also
brought forth reiterated remarks that
the public generally is more than well
supplied with steel of various kinds.
The German chancellors speech in the
Reichstag scheduled for today and not
disclosed as yet. is awaited with con
siderable interest, and naturally to
day's many peace rumors were given
more credence. The motor shares were
the chief sufferers in the declining
movement, fresh liquidation asserted
itself as being Induced by apprehen
sion over the status of future trade.
The possibility of important interna
tional political events, has for the time
being changed the complexion of
things in general, and in conjunction
with the rather strained technical posi
tion of the market, leads us to be
lieve that it will be rather difficult to
bring about any substantial improve
ment in prices, until something more
optimistic is in sight.

Numbers On Registration Cards
Will Not Govern In Drawing of
Men for Service In Draft Army
Considerable excitement was caus
ed on the streets today by the an
nouncement of a list of numbers that
wore supposed to have been drawn in
connection with the army draft and
immediately there was a scramble and
digging down in pockets to see if the
owner of a registration certificate
bore one of the numbers on the list
that was given out. As a consequence
quite a number found that they had
ihe certificates bearing those numbers.
Among them were Albert J. Detloff,
manager of the Orpheum theatre: Lef
ty Wilson of the same place; E. C.
Tracy, of the Central theatre; W. T.
McGlynn, of the Imperial Confection
ery; Harry Hayes, proprietor of the
Antiseptic barber shop; O. L. Mize,
of the Bisbee Auto Co.; R. E. Boat
right, Tom Moran, John Rock, Wayne
Northington, Walter Sheppard; Ivan
Johnson and Evan Wile,
Some began to worry and prepare
for making arrangements to go to the
front, but their, worry and prepara
tions are for naught.
The official registration board of Co
chise county, composed of Sheriff
Harry C. Wheeler the executive officer.
Ray B. Krebs, county recorder and Dr.
C. H. Hunt of this city, has not re
ceived one word of instructions in re
gard to making the drawing and only
a few days ago did they receive their
appointments from Governor Camp
bell. Under the instructions that were
sent at that time, there is now being
made in Tombstone the serial num
bers that will be used in the draft a3
will be seen by the wording of the in
structions that are printed below. The
serial numbers on the cards will not
be completed until some time tomor
row and the board expects to have
them in the hands of the adjutant gen
eral of the state of Arizona, Saturday
morning when they are required to be
in.
The numbers on the registration
certificates that are now held will not
be the numbers that are to be drawn
and could not govern for the fact that
alone in the Bisbee precinct there are.
for instance, 10 certificates bearing
the number "11" which was one of the
numbers published. In the first ward
in Bisbee there were six different men
registering and each numbered his
cards consecutively so that there are
six with the same numbers in the first
ward; in the second ward there are
two cards, one number "11" and an
other numbered "11A", and in the
third and fourth wards there are two
more, making the total of ten for the
Bisbee precinct.
The serial numbers that are now be
ing made will govern the draft and
therefore those who thought they had
been drawn had their worry for noth
'r.K. Tha public will be informed
vhen the drawing is to be made and
according to the instructions given
belcw the lists will be posted and pub
lished with the serial numbers.
The following taken from the official
'rrtructions sent to the registration
board and received by them since the
first of July fully explains the matter
of the numbering and the regulations
thereof:
Sec 9 Duty of Local Boards to Num
ber Registration Cards:
Immediately upon its organization,
and, if practicable, within three days
thereafter, each local board shall num
ber each and every registration card
then in its possession, beginning with
No. 1 and continuing consecutively un
til all registration cards are numbered.
These numbers shall be known as "se
rial numbers" and must be entered
in the face of each registration card
in red ink between the words "Form
1" occurring at the left-hand top of
the card, and the words "Registration
card." The local board will at the
same time give the same "serial num
ber" to the corresponding copy of each j
registration card which it numbers.
The registration cards should not,
for the purpose Vf assigning such "se
rial numbers," be alphabetically ar
rangement of such registration cards.
As additional registration cards are

Section 10 Local Board to Make and
Post Lists of Persons Whose Regis
tration Cards Are in its Possession:
Concurrently with the numbering of
the registration cards as above pro
vided each local board must prepare
four duplicate lists of the names of
alUpersons whose registration cards
are in the possession of such local
board. Such lists must contain the
names Of all such persons arranged in
the order of their consecutive "serial
numbers" that is, the number in red
ink on their respective registration
cards beginning with No. 1.
The local board shall retain one copy
of such list. It shall, immediately
upon completion of the list post one
copy in a conspicuous place, accessible
to the public view, in the office of the
local board; it shall at the same time
make one copy accessible, in the office
of the local board, to the press, with
a request for publication: and the
clerk of the local board shall send one
copy at the same time by registered
mail to the Provost Marshal General
in Washington.
Each local board must thereafter
daily prepare in the same manner four
duplicate lists of the names of all per
sons whose registration cards are
thereafter received or made out by it
each day, and the name of each person
on such lists must be given its "se
rial number" in the manner hereinbe
fore provided; and each local board
must daily retain, post offer for pub
lication, and mail copies of such addi
tional lists so containing the "serial
numbers" as above provided.

THE LOYALTY LEAGUE.
If there is a blemish upon the nanle of Arizona as a
patriotic state because of the copper mine strikes that
now hang low like a plague stricken mist over the state,
it will not be the fault of the sixteen hundred members
of the Workmen's Loyalty League of the Warren District.
These miners have pledged themselves to support the
government in the prosecution of the war and to fight, if
necessary, for the protection of their homes and for the
inalienable right of a man to work unmolested if he so
desires.
This answer of the Workmen's Loyalty League to the
anarchists and trouble makers and town destroyers Uiat
are still moiling around here trying to shut down the
copper mines sounds good, looks good and IS good whole
some news for the state to hear. There are plenty of
honest men in the mines of Arizona. All they need to
do is to organize themselves in themselves and by them
selves with their own and their country's -interests solely
before their eyes.
Bisbee is proud of this Loyalty League. She was proud
of its mebers when they marched in the sunlight of
Fourth of July morning down her streets. They looked
and marched like soldiers then. They ARE soldiers.
Their courage and patriotism have been tested and found
not wanting. They are on duty. They have enlisted and
come out in the open to fight their own and their country's
enemies. They have done much good in this district and
they will do more. They mean what they say in the
resolution they have adopted. Every man of them is a
miner or a mucker, and every man is in this fight for
right and decency to a finish.
ARIZONA STRIKES HOSTILE TO NATION.
(El Paso Herald.)
These strikes which are paralyzing the copper produc
tion in Arizona are a dead loss to the state. Even more
than that, they are a loss to the nation at a time when
it cannot afford to lo6e any valuable product. They are
a loss to everyone. They are a loss to the country which
needs copper, to the mine operators and their stock
holders who need dividends, to the miners and mechanics
who need their wages, to the government that needs
taxes, and to the host of people who supply the miners
and who need their business.
At Bisbee, one, of the demands infor a flat wage rate
of $6 a day. but that is no tremendous matter. The miners
are receiving wages not far from $6 now. If copper
keeps on going up they would have the $6 wage in a
comparatively short time. It is not the issue in the Bis
bee strike. In the other strikes wages are also of minor
importance. At Globe and Miami they are not included
in the demands.
Other demands vary from camp to camp. Those which
concern conditions of labor could have been settled very
.easily without strike by conferences with the employers.
It might have taken a little time to convince the operators
of the propriety of the requests, but it might have been
done. If the element of distrust and apprehension had
been kept out of the mine operators' minds, there is little
doubt that most of the demands would have been con
ceded in the course of a few parleys, whether or not t'ie
operators were really in favor 'of them, for the last thing
in the world the mine operators want at a time like this
is a strike if it can be avoided without, in their view,
plugging the whole future of the business into a morals
of trouble.
It is because most of the demands would probably have
been granted by the mine operators under different cir
cumstances that the strike is a total loss to Hie miners,
even should they win, for they will have been depriving
themselves of wages which they might have earned while
ngotiating with the operators for an amicable and satis
factory understanding.
How much Is that wage loss? Arizona's part in the
production of nearly half of America's copper represents
a monthly wage distribution of more than $6,000,000.
The Bisbee. Globe-Miami and Ciifton-Morenci-Aletralf
miners and others striking witli them will lose the greater
part of that $6,000,000 if all three strikes run a month.
Incidentally, the copper mines of the state disburse an
other $7,000,000 a month for supplies, fuel, steel, timbers,
machinery renewals and improvements, taxes and other
fixed charges. It is that $7,000,000 which persons no:
directly cannocted with the mines will lose, in great part,
if the strikes continue a month. But many of the miners
will lose more than their wages, because they are stock
holders and profit sharers of the companies as well as
employes. Particularly is that true of men in the War
ren District around Bisbee.
Wages have almost doubled since the first months of
1915. At that time the average wage for miners in Ari
zona was $3.25 to $3.50 a day. With t,he great increase
in the demand for copper and in its production which
followed, sliding scales of payment were inaugurated
both in the Warren and the Globe-Miami districts.
This brings us to the point. The overshadowing issue
in all these strikes in the copper camps of Arizona is
whether the Industrial Workers of the World are to force
the mining companies under their domination. The com
panies are not afraid of their men, or of any fair minded
men. They fear the evil work of the I. W. W. which
aims to take the mines away from their rightful, lawful
owners and hand them over to the L W. W. leaders who
would thus become the head men in charge of these
wrongfully acquired properties.
The I. W. W. leaders are very frank about it. A sneaker
at Bisbee declared in public that this strike was merely
the opening wedge of a movement to take the mines
away from their possessors. In these circumstances the
operators naturally realize that to concede the demands
now made would merely invite another attack. If the
strike at Clifton, Morenci, and Metcalf is under the I.
W. W. direction, it has not become evident. But the situ
ation is much the same. The unions are trying to force
the issue with the mining companies at a time when it
ought not to be forced on issue which might very well
until the United States is at peace and in less desperate
need of copper.
Workers must live, they must receive what they rea
sonably consider a fair wage, they must not be subjected
to oppression at company stores or robbed for hospital or
other "dues" often thus miscalled, and they must have
safe mines in which to work, with proper ventilation,
proper timbering, and the usual safety precautions.
But this is not the time to force the question of union
ism. It is not the time to force the question of the closed
shop or to rob the stockholders of their property as the
L'W. W. would do. That is placing a mild construction
on the intents of the I. W. W. There is more than a sus
picion that the real purpose of the I. W. is to paralyze
the United States in time of war and thus force the
country to lose the war, no matter what sacrifice, in lives
lost, defeats on the battlefield might entail.
The miners of Bisbee and of Globe and Miami will
awaken one of these days and realize they have been
hoodwinked by clever spellbinders of th I. W. W. They
will find they have lost the confidence of their em
ployers, blackened the name of organized labor and lost
their money. For their pockets are being picked right
now. .We have It from Charles H. Moyer, president of
the national Mine. Mill and Smelter Workers, that the
Industrial Workers of the World had no money when
this campaign started, but now they seem to have plenty
of money. We have it from another source that one of
the first things the I. W. W. organizers did was to levy
cssessments on all the miners. They may have re
ceived financial aid from sources hostile to the United
States or they may not. They will not, it will be seen,
finance a long strike. It will be a quick victory or none.
Already the I. W. W. leaders are beginning to drift out
of Bisbee to visit Globe and Miami where more collections
have been or will be taken up. If the strike lags at
Globe and Miami they will again drift and keep drift
ing. They will go with the coin in their pockets and
their fellow laborers of the southwest will be left holding
the bag and the bag will be as empty as their pockets.
The best word The Herald can give these thousands
of miners is the advice that they cut loose from the agita
tors right now and get back on the job and then if vir
tually important conditions need changing, go to the
bosses like men. under the right leadership and in a fair
spirit, and ask for it.
Has it ever occurred to you that the pick and flower
of our young men, ten million of them, are now waiting
with sublime calmness the results of the selection of the
first five hundred thousand for the draft. Most of them
are holding positions in the industrial world for which
they worked and studied and trained to secure. Most of
them live in happy and comfortable homes with loved
ones. But their government, established by the law of
ballots and majorities, has called them, and they are pre
pared to answer without question. The acceptance of
this tremendous conscription, the attitude of 95 per cent
of our people towards it, these are concrete testimonials
to the greatness of the Republic. Privitation, hardship,
labor and deadly danger await this army now being called
from comfort and security, but these young men and their
families and associates know full well that the Republic
is in danger, aud that comfort and security at home are
only possible through prompt answer to the call of duty.
"Vive Sammee!" shouted the French populace when
the first American soldiers landed on the quay." And thus
tt was that our boys were given a nickname for the war.
The name "Sammee" has come to stay, declare tiip cor
respondents. The English "Tommies" and the French
'Poilu" and the American "Sammees" will lanibast the
"Huns" from now on Hill they holler "nuff. "
The Russians hit 'em hard enough on the eastern 1 ne
to call Von Hindeuburg over there. The British are about
due for another smash at Arras and back will come Hin-
denburg. Then the French will strike again at Laou and
"Hindy" will have to go down there. AND THEN, w.iec

velopments, apparently interested
not at all in the nebulous demands
on which they were called out and
with few manifestations of bitter
ness toward their former employ
ers. Unkempt Agitators Control.
It is a study in psychology, rath
er than in economics. There is
no commanding leader. The sit
uation has been controlled by a
group of a half-dozen rather un
kempt sort of men, gathered in a
lodging house room, full of zeal in
their propaganda .possibly sincere,
frank to state that their aim is the
tearing down of all property rights
and the substitution of a condi
tion where the meanest and least
schooled yokel shall have the
same voice and the same wage as
the gentlest bred scholar or the
most skillful artisan. They seem
to care little for their own de
mands, which call for a miner's
wage only 15 cents a day above
the rate now paid on the basis of
30-cent copper, for no reduction of
wage when c'opper falls, and for
a variety of rather minor internal
regulations.
War "Wall Street's Fight."
They cast aside as immaterial
any consideration of the war that
threatens the very life of the na
tion whose protection they have
claimed, casually referring to it as
"Wall Street's fight." While it is
possible that the nation-wide agi
tation is fostered and even fi
nanced by traitorous or alien in
fluences, it is hardly likely that
the local representatives have any
direct knowledge of such condi
tions, or even interest in it. They
are happy in their day of leader
ship and in its opportunities to ex
change the soap box for the ample
forum of a city park, so geneiVusly
provided by money that mainly
came from the corporations whose
industry they seek to destroy.
Theyre Regular Soap Boxers.
They are orators no doubt of
it. But their patter is that of the
usual run 'of soap box agitators,
full of references to the "grinning
of the people by the bloated mon
opolies that arc sucking the life
blood of labor. Bisbee has been
as well fed up on that sort of
thing lately as niost western com
munities, but the shirt-sleeved and
suspendered apostles have a con
stant audience of faithful disci
ples. Call Themselves "Wobblies."
The strikers are to be divided
about equally into two classes
those who wanted to strike and
those who did not. A proportion
of the willing quitters already
were members of the I. W. W., who
rather rejoice in taeir self-given
appellation of "Vjibblies." They
are tf the type from which conies'
the tramp. Most of them are of
recent arrival, , put at work as
"muckers," with little reference to
qualifications underground, lor tue
mining companies have needed all
the men they could secure to fill
the maws of the immense furnaces
to be fed in the smelter town of
Douglas.
Are Called "Floaters."
In the mining parlance, these
men are known as "floaters" or
"ten day men." Here it happens
that a very large percentage are
aliens. Very generally they are
nVt voters, a fact due partially to
their itinerancy. Very much in evi
dence among them are individuals
plainly lacking in education, thrift
or ambition, who look forward to
the golden day when by lajv all
men shall be declared equal in
earning value and in social stand
ing. It is a common enough type.
The Very Same Old I. W. W,
It is the same that was driven
from San Diego by its business
men a few years. ago; that raided
the hop fields of northern Cali
fornia and that lately used force
in the invasion of Everett, Wash.:
that occasionally captures rail
road freight trains; that estab
lishes "mulligan" camps by the
roadside but never establishes
homes.
Hold Property Rights in Con
tempt. Contemptuous of property rights
and destructive by habit, its lead
ers yet claim to be advocates of
pure socialism and indignantly de
ny charges that they are anar
chists. Mouthpieces of the profes
sionally poor, they are followed by
Uieir kind. In instance, thi,s morn
ing, before the Copper Queen's
office building, a passerby was
stopped by a stout young man.
who, with metropolitan expertness
in the craft of "mooching," asked,
"Couldn't you spare a bit of
change to a hungry man?"
"But why ate you begging when
there is work for every man?"
The outraged mendicant's retort
was quick and to the point: "l.'ye
suppose I d rat?" Despite his lofty
assumption of willingness to
starve for principle, it is probable
he would not work at all.
Miners Fear To Be Called "Rats."

Compelling a man to save, and we doubt if any law
couid make the thriftless provident.
In this matter of saving you must either take
the advice of those who know or learn by your own
experience that it does not pay to live right up to
your income, spending every cent you earn, regard
less of that future which may not be such a time ol
prosperity ior you as the present is.

BROOKLYN. July 5. The Brooklyn
team celebrated the raising of the Na
tional league pennant by beating New
York. President J. J. Tener delivered
an address.
When the National league president
and Manager John McGraw met at the
park, Tener reached out his hand and
said: "How are you, John?"
McGraw shook the executive's hand
but apparently was too much surprised
to do more than mumble some unintel
ligible reply.
Brooklyn batted all three New York
pitchers hard. Hickman, besides mak
ing a home run, had a busy day in
center.

FORD BREAKS WINDOW.
Quite a little excitement was caus
ed about 7:45 this morning when the

tleman from over the Divide. It will
cost him about $200 to repair the dam
age. ABOLISHED.
The city council of Douglas voted
unanimously Tuesday night to abolish

will give all women there time to
move. While a majority of the alder
men opposed the closing, looking upon
the district os a necessary evil and its
abolition as a source of danger to the
omniunity, the step was taken out of
deference to the military authorities,
who asked for the abatement of the
district.
ROAD COMPLETED.
Advices have been received here
that the new road has been completed
from Ft. Huachuca to Canille around
the north point of Huachuca Moun
tains. The road was built by the For
est Department of the government.
The road cost $5,000 for the two miles
With the Russians holding their
gains in Calicia against Austro-Ger-man
attacks the indications of strong
er activity in the other war theatres
are multiplying.
On the wt-etern front the British
have advanced and the French artil
lery is active from north of the Aisne1
to the Meuse. The artillery activity
has increased on the entire Austro
Italian front; there has been local
activity in Roumania and on the Mac
edonian front the Germans havp taken
the offensive on a small sector.
Around Erzezany and near Lipnica
dolna on the Narayuvka north of
Rrzezany, the Austro-Germans have at
tacked the Russians in attempts to re
gain the territory lost early In the
week. Their efforts against Russian
advanced posts east of lirzezany were"
checked by the Russian artillery fire
and two. attacks near Lipnicadolna
! were broken up.
Farther south along the Hungarian-
Rumanian border and in Rumania
greater activity is reported. There
have been reports recently that the
fjuinanian army, reequipped and re
formed, was ready to assume the of
fensive and it is probable they are to
follow in the path of their Russian
neighbors.
In an attack against the German
lines southwest of Hollbeke. in Flan
ders, along the Ypres canal and on the
northern end of the recent British ad
vance against the Messines Ridge.
Field Marshal Haig's troops have driv
en the Germans back on a front of
600 yards. Major-General Maurice, of
the British army, declared Thursday
that the British army in France had
not lost a gun since April. 1915. and
that since the beginning of the war
the British had captured 739 guns and
lost only 133 of which 37 were recap-
I tured.

by the army trucks going to and from
Nogales as well as by the ranches in
that section and is a great improve

used.
BROKE ARM.
Francis McAllister, a youth of about
twelve years old had the misfortune
to break his arm on the Fourth. He
with a number of other small boys
were on the road between Johnson Ad
dition and Lowell when two ma
chines tried to pass and in getting
uway from them he slipped and fell
off the bank into the creek and in so
doing, broke the small bone near the
wrist on his left arm. The injured
member was set at once by Dr. Walk
er of Lowell.
WOMEN TO BE STOPPED.
As a result of the terrible heat on
the Mohave and Colorado deserts, Dis
trict Attorney Duckworth at San Ber
nardino yesterday issued instructions
to officers at desert points to halt all
altomobile parties containing women
and children and, if necessary to en
force the order, to arrest the driver.
No women and children are to be per
mitted to cross the desert between
Barstow and Needles by automobile
until after the weather changes. In
some of the sinks on the desert the
heat is so oppressive that children
could not survive should mechanical
trouble develop with automobiles.
FILINGS INCREASE.
Following the passage of the amend
ment to the homestead law by con
gress last December, entitling entries
on tracts of 640 acres of government
land, there has been a rush for such
land in the state of Arizona. Accord.'
ing to information given out by the
land office, there have been 1,281 fil
ings under the act. known as the
homestead stock-raising law. This
means that within the last six months
more than 640,230 acres of land have
been claimed by stock raisers in Ari
zona. But in spite of this great rush
there are still a large number of rang
es to be taken up. Under this law th
usual requirements for cultivation are
waived, and a stipulation for $S00
worth of improvements has been sub
stiutted. LETTERS TO FRANCE.
A letter to "the boys" in France
will be carried by a two-cent stamp,
