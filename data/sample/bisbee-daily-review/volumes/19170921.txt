Early in the war, when copper sold

The price agreed upon today was
set after extensive investigation of

"Three important conditions were
imposed by the board," said the an- j

Co-operation of labor in assuring the

The resolution will be put before L'e

Cause of Unrest.
The action was taken after a stir
ring speech by Secretary of Labol
Wilson, who declared that the spirit
of unrest among laboring men was
due in large measure to the general
impression that business has been
making excessive profits in which la
bor has not shared.
Should Be No "Swag."
"Has it ever occurred to you busi

"that the story has gone forth that
you are not patriotic; that you have
been profiteering? And did It never
occur to you that the workingman has
figurede to himself be will insist on
getting his share of the swag? My
position is that there should be no

The action of the farmers is due to a
number of causes, chief of which is
the scarcity of corn for feeding pur

farmer feels the government has
placed an arbitrary price upon his pro
duct at a time when the law of supply
and demand is in his favor, without at
the same time fixing the prices of oth

Remarkable Feat.
If the attacking forces maintain th
positions to which they have advanc

complished one of the most remark
able and important achievements in
recent months. The German infantry
made the most determined resistan.-e
in their attempt to regain this vital
ground and their artillery retaliated
heavily against the British big gun.-s.
Menin Road.
This phase of tUe battle of Flanders
which bids fair to become known as
the battle of Menin road, because it
centers in the territory astride the
Menin road, began at 5:40 o'clock.
The infantry advance was preceded
by a barrage of greater depth than ev
er before witnessed. Five distinct
barrages, in fact, were dropped ahead
of the men as they began their jour
ney into this difficult terrain. The
tremendous curtain of bursting steel
did its work well, and the troops push
ed forward rapidly toward their ob
jectives. Ground Improved.
Fair weather lately had im proved
the ground somewhat but the mu 1
still lies deep ever wide reaches of it
and the whole territory is covered
with water-filled shell holes, tangled
barbed wire and shattered trees. Tlie
German defenses consisted largely of
concrete redoubts scattered in profu
sion over the entire country and froni
these they have been able to pour a
stream of bullets into the ranks of the
advancing troops. Every little elev.i
vation also held its machine-gun em
placements and all the woods were lit

The British encountered hard fight

Associated Press Correspond
ent Declares that Accom

Greatest Feature of Flanders.
(By Review Leased Wire.
Another concentrated effort by the
British to break down the German de
fenses east of Ypres is under way.
A British drive along a front of eight j
miles between the i pres-Cominea and
the Ypres-Staden railways was started
at dawn Thursday morning. At night
fall the British commander reported
the occupation of important positions,
the capture of more than 2000 prison
ers and the infliction of heavy casual
ties on the Germans.
Prepare for Days
Heavy artillery preparation for days
had been going on. with exhaustive
raids in anticipation of a tremendous
infantry assault, and when the British
left the trenches they were preceded
by row upon row of barrage fire,
reaching into the German lines to a
greater depth than on any previous
occasion. Concrete redoubts, hun
dreds tf machine guns, barbed wire
entanglements and marshy ground
faced the British in their storming op
erations, but the heavy guns have cut
down many of the barriers and the
British went forward steadily, gain
ing all their objectives and penetrat
ing the German lines in places for a
mile or more.
Will Mean Much
The Associated Press sun corre-
spondent at the front declares that if
the British maintain the positions to ,
which they have advanced "they will j
nave accompiisnea one 01 me most
remarkable and most important
achievements In recent months."
Germans Attacic
On the French front no important
fighting is reported, except a German
attack southeast of Cerny, which was
checked by the French fire before the
enemy reached the French lines, and
French attacks near Hill 344 and east!ar
of Sanrtgneux which broke down with-!
out success, according to the Berlin I
war office.
Russians Resist
The Russians are determinedly re
sisting the attacks of the Teutonic
allies on the Riga front. After a
strong infantry -attack of the Ger
mans in the regton east of Lemberg,
Lett troops in a counter-attack drove
the enemy back with heavy losses. In

BEAT SUGAR ID
AGREE TO EIGHT
CENTS FORSWEET
Producers of the Country
Come to Agreement With
The Food Administration.
Distributing Plan Wlil Be
Worked Out
(By Review Leased Wire.)
WASHINGTON, Sept. 20. Beet su
gar producers in conference with the
food administration today reported a
unanimous agreement under which
the stable retail price of sugar will be
about eight cents a pound. They will
sell to wholesalers at eastern refining
points at 7 1-4 cents a pound, cane
basis, and the retail price, it was stat
ed, would normally be not more than
3-4 cents higher.
International Committee.
At the same time, the food adminis
tration announced that an internation
al committee of five had been named
to arrange for the purchase and distri
bution of sugar needed by the United
States and allied countries. This
committed, acting through the food
administration under authority of
President Wilson's proclamation plac
ing the sugar industry in this country
under license will control a large pro
portion of the world's sugar output.
American Members.
George M. Rolph, head of the food
administration's sugar division; Earl
D. Babst, president of the American
Sugar Refining Company, and William
A. Jamison of Arbuckle Brothers, are
the American members of the commit
tee. The allied nations are represent
ed by Sir Joseph White, and Sir James
Drake, British sugar men.
Distributing Plan.
Details of the sugar . distributing
plan will be worked out by a food ad
ministration commission consisting of
H. A. Douglas, Detroit; E. C. Howe,
Denver; W. H. Hannam, San Francis
co; S. H. Love, Salt Lake City; W. H.
Petricken, Denver; S. W. Sinshelmer,
Huntington Beach, California; and W.
P. Turner. Detroit.
Cane Sugar Question.
Inclusion of the big Cuban cane su
gar producing in this allied distribut
ing scheme will be discussed with the
food administration tomorrow by the
Cuban minister. Dr. Manuel de Ces
pedes. Cuba's participation in the
plan is expected.
Producers Agree.
American cane sugar representatives
it is believed, will take action similar
to that of the beet sugar producers.
Most cane producers already have
agreed to 7 1-4 cent price or its equiv
alent but this is not regarded as final.
The objections of about 10 per cent of
the beet sugar men were the compos
ed at a conference tonight.
Effective October 10.
The new sugar price will become ef
fective in the west, October 10, when
the 1917 crop reaches the refineries
and in the east aboht two weeks later.
The present price of beet sugar to
wholesalers is about 8.4 per cents a
pound.
Action Is Patriotic.
"This patriotic action on the part
of the beet sugar producers of the
United States," said a food adminis
tration statement tonight, "demon
strates conclusively the value of this
industry to the country in coming for
ward with new prices at a time when
sugar naturally would be selling at
much higher levels."

Prisoners Taken
in Numbers From
German Trenches
(By Review Leased Wire)
LONDON", Sept. 20t The Reuter
correspondent at British headquarters
has telegraphed the following:
Many Prisoners.
"Quite shortly aljler the opening
of the attack, one unit reported 60
prisoners had come in;, another had
reported 50. It is reasonable to count
upon a very considerable haul of pr'.s
out-ra.
Tanks Employed.
"Tanks were employed in limited
numbers for the grouud does not favor
their use, but some of these machines
were esen by the airmen moving t
the assistance of the infantry whero
the latter were teniporaril yheld up.
Flyers Take Part.
"The flying men are taking a great
part of the battle and are carrying
out a much more tluborate and co
ordinated offensive than on any pre
vious occasion.
Germans Surprised.
"The first advance the British rn'd
very rapidly, meeting only light skir
mishes. The Germans confess that
they were sin prised at asutb a quick
ly delivered attack.
Gallery Gives Trouble.
"Schiller Gallery, a long line of pill
boxtb, gave considerable trouble, but
i
i
i
the dash of our men was irresistible.
Shell Holes Alive.
"Our walking wounded report that
the shell hole and pill box yielded its
quota of anything between a dozjn
and 30 prisoners. Some surrendered
without firing a shot; others mude
stubborn resistance by fire and bomD
throwing.
Many Surrender.
"As our barrage crept toward them
the occupants of these defensive posi
tions issue dwith fixed bayonets, mani
festly in accordance with previous
orders to receive the attack. But
many when they saw our infantry
sweeping toward them surrendered.
The larger proportion of the prison
ers are quite young and chiefly liavar
ians.
Consolidating Guns.
"Under cover of a heavy protective
barrage, the work of consolidation has
been strenuously progressing through
out the afternoon. Our lighter batter
ies have been gotten forward in won
derful fashion.
Casualties Not Heavy.
"The casualties are not heavy, con
sidering the success achieved."

They needt have no fear their sacrifi
ces will be wasted he-e.
"Unless the en'cui'j allies are arle
to import the supplies necesrary for
the armies and the population, vic
tory may slip from our united grasp.
Profits and Proficiency
"I now am able to limit the profits
derived by those engaged in the food
Industries of the United Kingdom. We
examine the books and apply a sys
tem of cost and expense. I expect
to hear that Mr. Hoov.?r has taken
similar steps, so we will be abl? to
assure the people that, the existing
hich prices of iniponei food do not
represent profiteering.
Watching Price.
"I am anxiously wa1 chins the price
and the available supply across the
water of foodstuffs for cattle, upon
which high levels depends largely the
price of meat and bacon. Unless the
existing high levels are reduced the
poorer classes in the United Kingdom,
France and Italy are faced with many
privations."

soon to register all food traders here
and that if a few persist in disobey

letters that are being received da '.yi

Scarcely a day passes that scores of

lowing letter from William Breed of
Lonview, Tex., which is published,
word for word, just as it was writ
ten: L'ongview, Tex., January 13, 1917.
To Whom It May Concern:
On November 25, I bought one bottle
of Tanlac and commenced taking sani!
according to directions. I weighed
only one hundred and thirty pounds.
In ten days I gained seven pounds,
and I am gaining at the rate
of five pounds a week ana wev;n
one hundred and fifty-five pounds
at the present time. Tanlac beats
any medicine that I have ever
taken to build up a run-down system.
I would not take $100 for what it has
done for me. It is the best medicine
that I have ever taken for catarrh of
the head and I have tried several dif
ferent kinds Vf catarrh medicines. My
catarrh is nearly gone, also my stom
ach trouble, of which I have been suf
fering for more than twenty years, has
almost disappeared.' When I com
menced taking Tanlac I could not do
a day's work, but now I believe I can
do as much work as any man.
Very truly,

The Price of Coal
Bisbee citizens will watch with close interest the in
vestigation by the city council of the retail prices of
coal in this district. The ordinary plug citizen is get
ting positively savage. His bread, meat, sugar, lumber
and drygoods have gone up to prices that he is now
standing upon tiptoes to reach with the tips of hit
fingers, and his purse groans like a dying man every
time he reaches upward for something to keep the
breath of life in his poor carcase.
Now comes the coal man and hits him the finishing
blow. Coal is selling in Bisbee right now for seventeen
and eighteen dollars a ton. That is an awful price to
pay. It is too high. President Wilson fixed the price of
New Mexico coal at $2.40 per ton at the mine. The
freight rate from Dawson to Bisbee is $5.63. That would
make this coal cost eight dollars per ton in the railroad
yards at Bisbee. Smewhere between producer and
transporter and consumer some one is making ten dal
lars a ton on . coal, less the cost of hauling it to the
cellar.
Coal is selling in El Paso at $8.50 per ton and it costs
only $2.40 more for freight per ton to Bisbee than It
costs to haul New Mexico coal to El Paso. In other
words, after adjusting the difference in freight rates coal
is selling here for seven dollars more per ton than In
El Pasv
.No wonder the Bisbee council is. investigating the
prices of coe. It is a necessity in winter. The work
ing man must have coal no matter what the price. If the
president of this nation, in the midst of the tremendous
work and responsibilities entailed by the war, finds it im
portant enough to stop and investigate and regulate the
coal prices, then the Bisbee council can find the time and
bow to the importance of the matter of fuel.
Cost of production, freight rates and war have had all
the odium of high prices fixed upon them, but some one
else is also getting his or their dig out of the consumer.
The prices for necessities are beyond all reason. If the
war raises the cost of production three cents on the
pound the final cost to the consumer is hoisted to six
cents.
The submarine menace has made transportation by
sea more costly, and the demands of the allies have nat
urally raised the prices on all commodities and necej
sities. War times mean high prices the world over, and
have always done so. High prices mean higher wages
and more demand for labor. But where the consumer
rears back on his hindless and begins to howl is at that
point where the prices pass all reason and boundaries.
England qnd France, importing their wheat, are pay
ing less for bread than we are here in America, the home
of wheat.
If the cost of producing navy beans has increased and
the war times conditions warrant an increase of two
cents per pound for this mainstay of the poor man, no
one objects, but why tack on seven cents per pound ad
ditional charge, alf in the name of the war? Who gets
the additional five cents?
If a man gets killed in a boiler explosion or dies from
drinking bootleg whisky, no one lays his death to the
war.
The Review trustH that from the council's investigations
of the price of coal something definite and material may
be accomplished that will result in relief from the intol
erable burden of high prices. If there is no other remedy,
let them establish a municipal coal yard, buying so many
cars of coal a week and selling and delivering this coal
at actual cost plus a profit that is fair and reasonable so
that any private individual may compete with this yard i
and still make a good living. t
The actual figures on this coal proposition are stag
gering, and so, no doubt, would be figures on a dozen
other necessities that are being sold at tremendous profits
somewhere along the line.
Boy, page Mr. Hoover; also the coal committee of the
Bisbee city council.
FREE SPEECH AND SEDITION.
(From the Douglas Dispatch.)
Whenever an Industrial Worker of the World, a pro
German pacifist or would-be anarchist lets his love for
the kaiser overcome his caution, and villifies the United
Stated until he lands in jail, the first thing he does is to
raise a sickly howl about the rights of free speech being
denied him. This misguided individual who yells through
the prison bars, and on street corners that the American
government has encroached upon the privileges of free
speech shows an utter ignorance of what free speech is.
There is a distinction between free speech and sedition
that anyone but a Prussiamaniac ought to be able to see.
Free speech does not mean that a man is permitted to
utter any words that his tongue can frame. He cannot
jump up on his hind legs and advise those unfortunate
enough within the sound of his voice to take a shot at
the president. He has no license to preach treason, ex
tol the cause of Germany, belittle the entente allies as
powers whose triumph would be a curse to tbe world,
denounce the selective conscription law, urge resistance
to the statutes of the United States,, advocate measures
designed to cripple this country in its conduct of the
war, and give aid and comfort to the enemies of America.
Some of those who rail at the government for its inter
ference with their program of treason know that they
have no right to say things that they shout from the
houestops, others, encouraged by the adroit and cunning
seditionists, really think the government has no right to
put a limit on any disloyal utterances that they feel like
spouting. The former should be punished without a
show of mercy, the latter should be muzzled as one would
muzzle a snapping dog. Both classes ought to be in
terned. There is nothing more treacherous than the poisoned
spoken or printed word directed at the nation or its
course when it is engaged in a struggle to maintain its
existence as a democratic country. The 'mouthings' of
those who would rather see Germany win than the Unit
ed States are more despicable and of deadlier influence
than the work of the paid spies of the Berlin government
possibly could be. One can understand the motives of
the spy, but the motive that impels the tattling traitor at
home is beyond the ken of a patriotic mind to compre
hend. In a resolution adopted by the so-called People's
Council for Democracy and Peace, framed after the gov
ernor of Illinois had blocked their meeting plans at Chi
cago, there were these words.
We urge the people of the United States to repudi
ate this violent assault upon tbe rights of free speech
and free assemblage, and, as the only effective answer,
we call upon them to organize in peaceable law
abiding assemblage to adept legal methods to protect
their rights and liberties.
They did not seem to realize that there are about 100,
000,000 Americans banded together for that very purpose,
and that they are united in order that no treacherous
element shall make it so that those rights shall not ob
tain. According to this council it would be perfectly
legitimate for the German military general staff to hold
a meeting on American soil to map out plans for an Amer
ican invasion, provided the meeting might be without dis
order. Governor Lowden, in reply to the resolution
aptly said:
Such a conspiracy (as a pro-German peace meeting
In America) ought not, when the nation is battling for
its life, to find shelter under a claim of freedom of
speech. If we lose this war, real free speech will be
lost, and this society, which now claims privilege,
will contribute to that result. A treasonable conspi
racy is none the less a crime because it is staged in
public. A crime is not less a crime because the
world is taken into the confidence of those who com
mit it.
There are people right here in Douglas who daily are
making seditious statements and who would cry 'free
speech' were they silenced. The admonition to Germans
in the United States made by Attorney General Gregory
when war was declared against Prussia should apply to
everyone else in the country as well. "Obey the law;
keep your mouth shut," he said, and it would be well for
all to heed it.
Indications now point to another call for half a mil
lion men. Three hundred thousand have already been
summoned in the draft. Six hundred thousand are now
under arms in militia regiments and the regular army.
Looks like a million men for France next summer. A
million, fighting with the Tommies and the I'oilu, can j
just turn the trick.
Rippling Rhymes
I (By WALT MASON.) j
REST
All summer I have been Out West,
where people go from home to rest,
among the snow-capped hills, to be
away from office chairs, and city noise
and business cares, and all the work
day ills. I saw a million, less or more,
and most of them found rest a bore,
and longed to be back home, where
each could for bOme dorrars chase, and
plan new business schemes and place
more gray hairs on his dome. So few
of us know how to rest! By mad am
bition we're possessed to nail anOther
er bone, to add one large round dollar
more, one shining doubloon to the
store that we already own. We can
not lay our harness cOwn, forsake the
hot and bustling town, and have a
restful time; we fear that while re
pose we take, some other fellow, more
awake, might beat us to a dime. And
so vacation finds us sore; we walk the
mountains or the shore, and fume ana
sigh and fret: we yearn for cares we
left behind, and tell our wives the
beastly grind is still the tone best bet.
Alas, we've never learned to rest, to
let our work slide galley west, to
slumber and -relax; we do not like to
pace lifeB road unless we bear a
galling load upon our creaking backs.

The I. W. W. is as dead as an Eastern herring so far

against Bisbee is still as strong as ever. Agents and

they will spread their poison in every section of the

D. A. Davis, one of the secretaries
in charge of Young Men's Christian
association work with the American
forces in France, recently visited
British and Canadian fronts, and there
had the fact impressed upon him anew
that the work of a field Y. M. C. A
man is that of an "unarmed soldier.-
Concerning his visit to the front, Mr.
Davis, a Syracuse university graduate,
writes in part as follows:
"The work which the British and Ca
nadian secretaries have done in the
most dangerous and difficult position
is really beyond all praise. I visited
some huts which were within a thou
sand yards of the Germans and where
practically no one was allowed in the
day time. The place was constantly
under shell fire and the day I was
there shells were landing on all sides.
Several of the orderlies who wee
serving in different Young Men's
Christian associations in this section
of the front have been killed or in
jured. "In another Young Men's Christian
association which I visited, 15 of the
huts or dugouts had been destroyed
by shell fire. I visited one cellar
within a few hundred yards of the
Germans which was also under shell
fire, where one of the services which
the men are rendering was selling
eggs. Fifteen thousand eggs a week
are being sold .the amount of the sales
being limited only by the number of
eggs which could be obtained.

SAN FRANCISCO, Sept. 20. F. E.
Rigall of Grayville, III., continuing his
testimony today in the trial of Frank
C. Oxman, accused of attempted sub
ornation against Thomas J. Mooney,
under sentence of death for murder,
implicated District Attorney Charles
M. Fickert and his chief assistant,
Edward A. Cunha, in the alleged
"frame up."
Rigall charged that Fickert bad
given him $15, and that Cunha, after
Rigall had complained that Oxman
had failed to "come through" with a
promised check for $25, had asked
him:
Feared Quarrel.
There is no danger of you fellows
falling out and spilling this thing, la
there?"
Rigall testified that Oxman promised
him the money in return for perjured
testimony against Mooney whose con
viction grew out of a bomb explosion
here July 22, 1916, which killed 10
persons.
Rigall showed letters and telegrams,
purported to have been written by
Oxman, inviting him to testify against
Mooney.
Pertinent Questions.
Why did you not submit these let
ters to the district attorney, to Bert
Cochrane, counsel for Mooney, or to
the judge?' 'asked Attorney Samuel
M. Shortridge, representing Oxman.
You knew Mooney was battling for
his life. Why did you not submit
that evidence to Edward A. Cunha,
assistant district attorney, when you
told him previous to Oxman's testi
mony that you would 'come clean?'"
Didn't Trust Cunha.
"I did not exactly trust Cunha and
was afraid of the others, so I took
the letters back home," the witness
replied.
He admitted that be was arrested
several times for disturbing the peace
and that on one occasion he gave the
officers the name of F. C. Oxman, "be
cause I was a member of the Gray
ville city council and did not wish to
start a scandal."
Complimented "Frame Up."
Asked why he had sent a wire of
congratulation to Cunha after the con-
iction of Mooney, Rigall stated:
"I was not congratualting him on
the conviction but on the splendid
frame up.' "
Was "CockfEyed."
The term "cock-eyed" appearing in
some of his telegrams to Oxman, the
witness explained as meaning "half
drunk." he declared he was "cock-
yed" a portion of the time he was
enroute from Grayville to San Fran
cisco to accept Oxman's alleged Invi
tation to giv false testimony against
Mooney.
Details of Offer.
Details of a supposed offer of $250
from Oxman if he "went through"
with counterfiet testimfiny against
Mooney were offered by the witness.
"I never inteded to give such testi
Imony," he declared. "I wanted to
get back home and wash my hands
of the whole affair."
Admits Fraud.
"You would make a dandy witness,"
District Attorney Charles M. Fickert
told him on one occasion, the witness
stated. He admitted that he "started
out to work a fraud on the district at

Man Tells of Tributes Paid
Educational System in District
Bisbee and the Bisbee school system
has been boosted all over the country
in an unsuspected way, according to
a letter received yesterday by G. E.
Kellogg, local manager of the Moun
tain States Telephone company, and
written by R. R. Ellinwood of the Elli-
son -White-Chautauqua system. Ellin
wood says in part:
"Several times I have had in mind
to write and tell you that Bisbee got
valuable publicity of exceptional kind
as a result of its first Chautauqua.
Every day throughout the remainder
of his tour Dr. A. E. Turner mention
ed the model system of schools of '
your city and paid a glowing tribute
the Supt. Philbrook for his all-the-
year-round plan of getting utmost ef
ficiency out of the school plant and
organization. Many of the talent and
employes took photos of Bisbe and the
Warren District which have been en-:
joyed by hundreds of people, for no
scenery is quite so picturesque." i
This is interesting news to everyone
interested in the Bisbee schools, for
whole-hearted publicity of this sort Is
after all, the best sort of publicity, i
Advertising of this sort can't be

The process of heating water for domestic purposes has been rev
olutionized in the past few years through the introduction and
perfection of gas fired water heaters, until today it is no longer a
a problem to secure an abundance of hot water quickly and econo
mically, in any dwelling, large or small.
Today, in the countless thousands of homes where gas fired water heaters are in
stalled, an abundance of hot water is available for any purpose. By some types of heat
ers the water is heated instantly at the turn of a faucet, by others, within a few min
utes after lighting the heatets, and all without labor, inconvenience or discomfort ind

THE BISBEE DAILY REVIEW, FRIDAY MORNING, SEPTEMBER 21, 1917.
Mining and Financial News
BY REVIEW
NEW YORK FINANCIAL.
NEW YORK. Sept. 20. After a
period of uncertainty, with narrow
and Irregular movements, the stock
market pained strength today and be
gan, a deliberate but well maintained
advance. Early declines were made
up and net pains of moderate propor
tions were established, with occasion
al rises of 2 points or more. Total
sales were 820.00 Oshares.
Except in the last hour the market
showed less buoyancy than during
yesterday's upturn. The compara
tively small volume of orders on hand
at the openinp led to a temporary re
newal of selling operations but de
mand caused the bears to reverse
their tactics and poin In the bidding.
There were no new factors of gen
eral application to offer an obvious
explanation of the movement Steei
stocks led the market .
The feature was the strong aemanii
for United States Steel which sold
at more than 7 points above the low
price of this week. The coppers, held
back by uncertainty as to the price
to be established for the metal, show
ed early heaviness but later made a
moderate advance.
The bond market did not reflect
the strength. of stocks. The tone was
irregular. '' Total sales, par value. 13,
320.000. TJ. S. 2's registered declin
ed and the 3's per cent on call.
Liberty bonds sold at 99-98 to 100.
GRAIN MARKET.
CHICAGO. Sept. 20. Frosty weath
er made the corn morkex average!
higher. Closing prices were unsettled
at the same as yesterday's finish to
Vt up with December 119. to 119
and May 116 to 116. Oats gained
to nef. The result in provisions
varied from 5 decline to an advance
of 35.
In the final corn dealings decided
breaks took place which nevertheless
did not deprive the market of good
support Hardly anything but the
weather conditions and the related
crop outlook received the least atten
tion as market factors. Frost had
penetrated as far southward as Ne
braska and there were predictions of
additional frost tonight in Iowa. A
prospect that much needed sunshine
and warmth would follow the cold
wave did a good deal to lessen bull
ish sentiment.
A strike of grain 6hovelers gave
Independent firmness to the oats mar.
keL Indications were the strike
would not prove serious.
Announcement that the government
was requesting country shippers to
give wheat preference until further
notice were expected to diminish
somewhat the movement of other
grain. Wheat receipts continued lib
eral in the northwest but scanty in
Chicago. All requests here for red
winter wheat were taken care of.
Packers buying formed the main
source of strength in provisions.
COTTON MARKET.
NEW YORK, Sept. 20. The cotton
market here closed strong at a net
advance of 46 to 83 points.

Aguinaldo's Son
to Fight for U. S.
SAN FRANCISCO, Sept. 20. Mi
guel Aguinaldo, son of General Emilii
Aguinuhio, Filipino rebel, whose cap
ture was made by the late Genera!
Frederick Funston, has been commis
sioned a second lieutenant in the
Philippine national guard, and is
about to enter the officers' training
camp near Manila to qualify as a reg
ular army officer. Words of youn.
Aguinaldo's military aspirations was
brought by G. A. Butz, manager of 1
j Manila hotel, a close friend of tin
j younger Aguinaldo, who arrived here
recently.
j "Miguel Aguinaldo was commission
ied a second lieutenant in the Philip
pine national guard by Governor Gen
eral Harrison a few days before I let
I Manila," said Butz. "At the saw
;time his father declined to accept p
post of high command."
! HE'D BLOW THE WHISTLE.
i "Suppose," read Capt. John T. Tuf
fey, Jr., Instructor of the Sixth Com
pany of the Ninth Division, at Fort
Harrison, from "Small Problems of In
fantry," "that your advance guard had
been surrounded; that you' knew the
approximate loqation of 'the enemy
and his number, but his position was
strongly held, and darkneis was com
ing on. What would you do?"
' "I'd let it be known that I was a un
ion man, and then I'd blow the whistle
and go to supper," volunteered one
fellow. And then, when he was
"bawled out" for' his flippancy, he had
another answer just as good and much
more apropos ready. Indianapolis

TO JAIL FOR CONTEMPT.
Frank W. Doan, the well known

ing, not as a visitor, but as a prisoner.
So did Fred Farrel. his client also

Douglas for conducting a disorderly
house and sentenced to pay a heavy
fine or serve 14 months in jail.
Through his attorney he appealed thv
case to the superior court, and the
rial was scheduled to . begin at 9
o'clock yesterday morning. At that
i our the jury was in the box and the
court was ready, but the defendant
and his attorney were not present.
Judge Lockwood thereupon ordered
tench warrants issued for both men
end excused the jury until 10 o'clock.
Doan and his client arrived at 9:15,
whereupon Deputy Sheriff Percy Bow-
den served the warrants on them and
they were placed in jail. When ar
raigned at 10 o'clock each man wa3
lined $25 for contempt of court. Far-
fell's bond of $250 had been declared
forfeited when he failed to appear at
9 o'clock. The case against Farrell
was continued until September 2S.

during the past few days over 100
young men have crossed the line in
unfrequented parts near Nogales and

were having trouble with tahe men
trying to beat their way south, ana ,
that on Tuesday one crew stopped the ;
tarin near Carboy and put off ten
young Americans who were stealing a
ride and made them get off. The con
ductor tt)ld tbem 'that he was not
runlng a slacker train."
Further reports are to the effect that
Hermissillo and Guaymas are at tne
present time harboring seeral hun
dred of men that have gone there to
avoid the draft and that at many of
the mining camps along the railroad
there are many others. One young
