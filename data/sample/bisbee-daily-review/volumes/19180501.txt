by von .srnim's army against the al
lied lines on the Flanders battle field
yesterday afternoon and evening met j
with no more success than the en- j
emy's futile and costly attempts earl
ier in the day to break through and
capture the hill positions west of
Kemmel.
Not only did the British and French
maintain their positions at virtually
all parts in the face of the furious on
slaught tut during the night they
re-claimed several bits of territory on
which, the enemy had succeeded, in
getting a hold.
Locre had again fallen into German
hands late yesterday, but th-a' French
once more made a dashing counter
drive, and thrust the enemy out of this
important place.
Huns Pay Heavy Toll
The allied lines in Flanders this
morning were to all intents the same
as when the Germans surged forward
yesterday. End in front of the defend
ing positions gray uniformed men lay
in great numbers, representing the aw
ful prica paid by the Germans.
North of Kemnvel the British and
French, countering in conjunction also
pushed forward somewhat during the
night and bettered their positions. At
one time yesterday the eCrmans actu
ally had ponrs men on the lower slopes
of both Mont Rouge and the Scherpen
berg. after they succeeded in driving a i
small wedge into the French lines be- '
twen these two elvations.

numbers of men in an attempt to posh .

In the meantime tne flanks .vsre"

was waged astride the Kemmel-Lac- j

no weak spot. !

FOR DAY RECORD
(By Review Leased Wirej
WASHINGTON, April 30. Liberty
loan subscriptions yesterday totalled
-174,433,00, the record for any single
day in the campaign and the begin
ning of what the treasury hopes will
be a banner week to drive the loan
far above the three billion dollar
minimum. The campaign total tonight
was 12,457,714.000, not including to
day's business which appeared large,
judging by reports from all parts of
the country of a final intensive can
vass. 'i he most nota '-.o feature of tho dis
trict records was the spurt of the
Atlanta district from 37 to 58 per cent
in a single day, bringing it within 7
per cent of the New York district
which now stands second from the
bottom in percentage of quota sub
scribed, although its total, $92,022,700,
is the greatest of any district.
Frisco Over Top
The San Fracisco district with an
official percentage of 88 and fifth po
sition in the percentage list, sent word
tonight that the 100 per cent mark
had been passed with subscriptions of
$211,000,000 or a million more than its
quota, and that later official reports
show it is entitled to the honor of be
ing the fourth district to go over the
top. If this proves true, the race for
fitth place in this honor contest ap
parently will be between the Chicago,
Dallas, Boston and Cleveland districts.
St. Louis still is striving to attain
honors in the population quota con
test. Ae report from there tonight
said that the district had attained a
percentage of 92 on the face of returns
at hand and that 29 counties in Arkan
sas with large money subscriptions
had failed to make any report Only
sixteen counties in the entire district
ihave failed to reach their money
quota ten of them are in Missouri,
five in Arkansas and one In Tennes
see. Reports of large sales in sec
tions of the Kansas City district pop
ulated by persons or German percent
age continue to pour in.
Chicago Has Record
Chicago continues to lead in honor
flag awards with a total of 3,243.
Other districts reported tonight that
they had awarded flags as follows:
Cleveland, 1,816; San Francisco,
885; New York, 710, and Philadelphia
259.
Maine was added to the honor
states today.

From the Harvard groiuids.and I I:r

fre in sarnie somewhere. The iiiany
cung nun in uniform give Caui-i-ridge
much the appearance of a ;-reat
naval center: certainly, it lis not like
the university city of old. Most of
:l.e Harvard halls and dormitories thnt
cciild he spared were turned over to
the radio students, whose area of l.:;
tation (xtends ctcse to t!ie famous
'G.1J C-jaFt." fi'.l-d now largely with
Hsr.'ard b::ys working their way

Old Hall Crowded
Memorial Hall, perhaps the most
famous of all the Harvard building3,
end wherein generations of- under
graduates have dined, is the main
eating establishment for the ladio
army. Three times a day fifteen hun
dred of them niarrh into Memorial
Hall like a well drilled regiment of
bluejackets and set up a ciatter aj
they cat, thnt would do honor ta any
battalicn of acedemic students.
But this old hall has its quiet period
for on pay da,y, which conies twice
a month only a handful go there to
dine. The radio boys walk with pe
"gJiost" and go him one better by
taking an eight-minute subway jump
to Boston, where they come up for
air and a change of scenery.
The radio students notably -ire or
derly. They are scattered over a
wide area, many of them lodging, fn
private homes without official re
straint. yet police and military records
reveal blank blotters so far as they
relate to radio students.
Finishing School Only
This being a finishing school only,
these who are able to copy ten words
a minute in the continental coda,
whit h is much slower than the Morse,
or regular te'eraph code, are ad
mitted for the sixteen weeks course.
To be sent out for service rft sea
they must be able to receive twenty
two words a minute, their minimum
grading. There are many experts
among the teaching force whose speed
runs up to 32 wonls a minute, but be

Complacency
Is America doing everything humanly
possible to have more than a million men in
France by the end of this year? Trie ques
tion is being asked with persistence by
newspaper writers and public men general
ly in the east these days. Secretary Baker
is back from France with the same air of
complacency he had during the machine
gun investigation, and with the same slug
gard action that accompanied that muddle.
Last January he declared that the war de
partment could put a million and a half of
men in France this year if transportation
facilities were provided. No one knows
whether they are provided or not, but it is
certain they have been largely increased.
And it also seems to be certain that large
bodies of men are leaving training camps
for embarkation. And it is also just as cer
tain that most inadequate provision i3 be
ing made for men to take their places.
Baker has delayed for weeks in asking
congress for more men and an increase in
the draft age. He is still undecided, he
says, as to what he wants. And at such a
time as this!
No one else seems to be undecided as to
what is badly needed. Pressed back, fight
ing with their backs to the wall, the allied
armies are calling for more men. Ex
President Taft declared in Philadelphia last
week that America must raise five million
men. He saw four more yearj of war
ahead, he said. , " 1
"For God's sake," Mr. Taft declared to
the Chamber of Commerce in a luncheon
addiess, "face the facts and prepare for
three or four years more of conflict. There
will be ten or fifteen more Liberty Loans.
It is better that all of us lay all our wealth
and all our children upon the altar of sac
rifice than that the war should go the wrong
way." 1
It is estimated that we have one million
and six hundred thousand men called to the
colors. And provision has been made to
call eight hundred thousand more men this
year. This will be a total of half of the
quota estimated as necessary by so well
known and informed a judge as Ex-President
Taft.
If Baker were only not so complacent
in his general demeanor and so optimistic
in his predictions he would stand better be
fore the country. The war ha3 reached a
desperate crisis. America is playing but a
small part upon the stricken field. Her
part is yet to play and, it is predicted upon
every hand that when she does enter the
game in earnest, she will play a leading
part. Therefore every public man in this
country, and especially every man vested
with a part in our war program, should be
anything but complacent; should never be
undecided. He should be alert and seri
ous; he should act instantly; he should
count time as the most priceless thing of
all right now. We cannot quibble or delay
or hesitate, unless we would fight Germany
alone.
Every man and every gun to France at
the first possible moment; this should be
our only watchword. Baker s attitude is
bad; his state of mind is worse. Somebody
should jar him out of this state of com
placency before it is everlastingly too late.
Jack Munroe, former Montana miner
and heavyweight pugilist, who made such
a poor shoving against Jeffries in a fight
for the championship, made a much better
showing in the great war. He is in
America now, one of the few survivors of
the famous Princess Pat's Canadians, to
aid in recruiting more Canuck regiments.
Munrce is over the draft age, but that made
no difference to him. But few pugilists
cf note have volunteered for active service,
hence Munroe's action and record stand out
all the more in contrast with that of the
fighting men of the squared circle. Most
of the pugilist volunteers are acting as box
ing instructors only. They are not carry
ing a gun. Ritchie, the lightweight king,
is a shining exception. Jess Willard won't
fight, either in or out of the ring. He should
be barred from any public exhibition. Only
two or three professional baseball players
of reputation have volunteered. A few
have been drafted and others have resisted
the draft. But football is one line of ath
letic sport, and one alone, that has respond
ed almost to a man to the call to arms. It is
estimated that ninety per cent of the fa
mous gridiron warriors of the past ten years
are warriors now in the allied cause. It
is to be doubted if any other athletic sport
has contributed ten per cent of its member
ship outside of those taken by the draft.
After the war football will take a high place
in the nation's affections because of its un
doubted tendency to breed patriots and heroes.
BUSINESS AND PATRIOTISM WALK
HAND IN HAND
Some idea of the depth and breadth to
which patriotism has penetrated the busi
ness life of the eastern cities may be gained
from the text of a tailor 'a advertisement in
a New York newspaper. This tailor ha3
veritably turned hij yardstick into a sword;
yea, he would hew a path to victory with
his shears. He starts his advertisement
with this stirring epigram: "A Liberty
Bond Puts the 'You' in U. S. A." Then
he goes on to tell the world, paying at lcait
two or three dollars an inch for the space
and the words :
"Are you just a Boo-Hoo Patriot? Docs
a lump swell your throat and a tear pearl
your eye, as you read of our "boys over
there" fearlessly facing the Black Blank
of the Great Beyond? Man alive, that's
not patriotism it's only emotional auto
intoxication. True-blue patriotism in
dulges neither in weak emotion nor wast
ed motion. It works, it doesn't weep; it
suffers, it doesn't snivel; it renounces, it
doesn't repine; it fights, it doesn't falter.
The prcof cf Patriotism is to buy Liber
Bonds to cast into bullets to hew a heroes'
lane to victory."
The above is something more than a
mere advertisement ; it is a national appeal.
Business and patriotism will mix finely if
the spirit guide the hands in the mixing
thereof. .
THE WEST ALWAYS AWAKE
Some of us here" in the East have been
wondering whether the West has "waked
up" to ihe war !
The West didn't have to wake up to the
war or anything else. The West never has
been asleep, when it came to national needs
or world help. The West always is ready
to get on the firing line and give more than
is asked of her.
She has the spirit as well as the sense of
service. She centers the best hopes of that
democracy whose fate this day hangs in the
balance. Her so-called "fads" of yesterday
are today's foundation stones. She is the
Gibraltar of Americanism, and the man
who questions her loyalty only reveals his
own ignorance.
In a German city of twenty thousand
population there is today only one doctor
and one surgeon to care for the sick and
the afflicted. The doctor, asked if he had
time and strength to care for all, replied
that he had not. "But the government's
orders," he explained, "are to care for only
those who can help the empire. Those per
sons over fifty-five years of age who are
sick we ignore entirely." Laconic, heart
less and characteristic of the German poli
cy of today, which is strikingly similar to
that of a pack of timber wolves.
It now develops from first hand infor
mation from Gen. Leman, the Belgian hero
who held up the Germans at Liege that
precious week, and vjfio has just been re
leased from prison, that Germany was not
told of the battle of the Marne until Feb
ruary of 1915. In other words, the nation
was kept in ignorance of a great defeat
from September to February, a period of
five months. And we in America talk of
our press censorship. Precious little we
know of such a thing.
"The war is in desperate straits," said
Maj. Gen. Leonard Wood in a Liberty Loan
address to a large crowd in Denver the oth
er night. "From the front there comes only
one word for us and that is 'Hurry.' We
must get ready as fast a3 possible. It is a
war of attrition. The side which can give
the most men will win. Five million is a
conservative number of men we must
raise. Half or more will be sent abroad;
half will be in training here to make up the
wastage, which will be terribly heavy."

QUEEN U'lLIIELMINA'S COUNTRY MAY BE FORCED INTO WAR
r
A military expert stuns up Us war
situation in the following cheerful, but
practicil manner:
Von Hindenburg continues his cease
less slaughter of German power by de
veloping a double offensive towards
Amiens and Ypres.
No success of tactical importance re
sulted trom the Amiens operations, but
tho capture of Mont Kimmel in the
northern area of operations has cm
phasli ?d the German threat against
Ypres. The net result of Ib-i week's
operations, however, has not given to
the Gen.ians sufficient territory to
justify their Tosses. The capture of
Amiens is as far off as ever, and the
fall of Vrres would not have Import
ant strategic consequences for the
Germans as long as the British lines
hold immediately to the west.
The sruall sectors of territory oc
casions! ;y yielded by the Allies are far
more worrying the the nerves than
their importance justifies.
It is uncomfortable! to read of the
German advances, but if these little
victories were not won there would be I4
no tern w" at ion to Von Hindenbure to
continue the merciless slaughter of his !
own troops.
There ere two possible ways by
which Von Hindenburg can win the
war in ihc west first, by separating
the French and British armies and an
nihilating one or tire other of them;
second, by wearing down the morale
of the Allies. The first method has
been practically impossible with the!
appointment of General Foch to the ,
supreme command of the allied forces, i
To win by the second method is Von
Hindenburg's purpose in incessantly
hammering at the western lines for
petty gains. If attacks of this charac
ter keep up long enough, it sometimes
happens demoralization sets in among
armies on the defensive. No indication
of such a situation has been shown on
the west front; and by continuing to

BY REVIEW
NEW YORK, April 30 Prices rose
1 to XVt points at the brisk opening
of today's stock market but reacted 1
to 3 points before noon, thereafter
pursuing an uncertain course with ir
regular and partial recoveries at the
close. The initial advance was the
direct result of the repulse of tr.
Teutonic forces.
Declines were facilitated by ad
verse rumors, among which was an
unsubstantiated report that the Wash
ington authorities intend to impose
further restrictions upon the coun
fry's exchanges, particularly those
dealing in cotton and foodstuffs.
United States Steel featured the re
versal and subsequent improvement.
The steel corporation's' quarterly
statement and its accompanying an
nouncement of the maintenance of the
"extra". 3 per cent dividend on the
common stock were not issued until
after the market's close. Salas
amounted to 550,000 shares.
Bonds were extremely variable, in
cluding Liberty issues, which com
prised the bulk of the larger edalings.
Total sales (par value) aggregated
$9,250,000.
United States bonds (old issues)
were unchanged on call.
GRAINS
CHICAGO. April 30 Renewed peace
lalk counted to a material extent to
day as a bearish factor in the corn
market. Prices closed nervous k to
1 net lower, with May 127"4 and
July 148 to HSVi. Oats finished un
changed to Ti down. In provision's
the outcome varied from 85 decline to
a rise of 10 cents.
Bears had the advantage In corn
almost the entire day, but especially
so after reports became public that
Austria was making a fresh peace
offer to Italy. Forecasts of warmer
weather likely to facilitate planting
tended also to put the market on the
down grade. Lowest quotations of the
session were touched after the peace
gossip had been made the most of to
further the interests of the bears.
Auspicious weather an dcrop con
ditions as well as the new peace move
nulled support away from oats. Sea
board demand was conspicuously ab
sent. Severe declines in pork continued
to result from liquidation by holders.
Offerings of lard and. ribs, though,
were relatively scarce.

HOUSES AUDIENCE
VIVID 'ADDRESS
Frank G. O'Dell, Federal
Bank Officer, Makes Stir
ring Address ; General
Swinton Assures America.
Twelva lnndred "residents of the
Warren district who last night packed
the Orpheum theater from the stage
to the doors, cheered themselves
hoarse and clapped their hands until
they burned, when they heard two
messages of the war one from the
heart of an American, and the other
direct from the trenches "over there."
The first message was that of Frank
G. O'Dell, chairman of the federal re
serve bank of Omaha, and the second
was from Major General E. D. Swin
tou, inventor of the British tank and
secretary of the British war cabinet
Both messages breathed of the war,
hut greater still both messages
breathed of a new spirit in America,
a new spirit in the ranks of the al
lies, and a new spirit in the front
trenches of the British, French. Por
tugese and other arms who are now
fighting as they never fought to stem
the tide of "hell-hounds" who are
pressing hard to break the strength
of battle lines before the Americans
can reach them. " "
General Swinton brought a message
of cheer to the Warren district from
the front line trenches. In opening
his address he belied anew the lack
cf I.ritisli humor; throughout his ad
dress he betrayed a sense of the com
ic which at times almost convulsed
his audience. His recitation of Ger
man (and he called them hell-hounds)
autrocitics. his statement of the man
ner in which the Prussian has de
graded war, and his word picture of
t.'ie crimes Hun soldiers have commit
ted against women and children, held
the audience entirely.
In closing the general assured resi
dents of this diFtrict that the allies
in France will hold the Prussia non-
silaught until tinally America san send
its great forces into the battle. He
praised the American in training
camps. He spoke of them as the pick
of the laud, as, "we would say, in
England, the strawberries on the top
cf tlie ho."
"And," he concluded, "they're dam
rood strawberries too."
1 As a last word, the general declar-
I .-1 '10 flirt nllloa ni ho "harffiny on
until hell freezes over, and when hell
freeies over, they will be there on
top of the ice."
Mr. O'Dell did not mince words in
his address. He complimented this
district fcr tjieir glorious work In
the Liberty oLan campaign, but call
ed on the residents to do more to
put their shoulders and hearts behind
this war business and give their ev
erything to see it through to a suc
cessful finish.
The speaker painted in words poetic
for their simpleness and directness
the leaving of thousands and hundreds
cf thousands of American boys for
France. He pictured their work in the
battle lines, their fight for democracy,
and finally the return of most of these
boys to the United States. The holi
day which will be declared upon their
return, the closing of the stores and
mines and factories and schools and
churches, the business houses, and
the demonstration of welcome, Jie
drew.
"This is your duty here and now,"
he defiantly cried out to his audience.
"This is your part to make this a fit
land for these young war heroes to
iive in, to see to it that there af6
no slackers, no pacifists, no pussy
footers, no spies sneaking about- in
the country to see to it htat the en
tire land is loyal."
Mr. O'Dell shattered to bits any
ideas heretofore Jield of Prussian su
periority, when he recited In brief
but pointed statement the achieve
ments which have been beneficial to
humanity since the Franco-Prussian
war. He characterized the Prussian
leader in his true light, decried the
atrocities which they have commit
ted, and concluded his address with a
hope for pure and unadulterated loy
alty and service and sacrifice through
out this country during the war.
General Swinton and Mr. O'Dell will
leave this morning for Douglas where
tliey will appear tomorrow night. They
will be accompanied by J. X. Gaines,
chairman of the Liberty Loan cam
paign for this district. They speak
under the arrangements of the Lib
erty Loan committee. .

the battle of Flanders, where the
ground everywhere is covered with the
gray-clad bodies of German dead, and
the British and French are holding
securely to all their positions.
From Saturday until well into Mon

continued their efforts to break the
British lines on the Ypres salient ajid
to press back the British and French
from the high ground to the south
west but everywhere fheir efforts
I were fruitless. True, they gained their
objective an dagain captured Loc.-e,
but a counter thrust forced them out
again and at last accounts the French
i were holding the village.
In the hilly region just to the north

I the enemy at several points, notably

War Council Meets
While the present halt in the battle
possibly indicated the near approach
of the throwing into the fray of the
great reserve Etrmy which General
Foch has gathered, that such is the
intention of the supreme commander
of the allied forces has not become
apparent. It is not improbable, how
ever, that at a meeting of the inter
allied war council in Paris Wednes
day, which will be attended by the
American, French, British and Italian
representatives, measures having in
view the turning of the tide of battle
will be uppermost in the discussions.
In all the various war theaters ex
cept the western the situation remains
relatively calm, so far as fighting is
concerned All along the front in
Italy reciprocal bombardments con
tinue and small maneuvers by reoon
noitering parties are being carried out.
In Macedonia, the Serbians in the
region of Monasti ragain have entered
an enemy position and annihilated the
garrison. They also have been suc
cessful in repulsing an attack by lul
garians, which had as its object the
recapture of positions of Vetretsk tak
en by the Serbians a week ago.
Austria Seeks Peace
The emperor of Austria Hungary is i

He is said to have appealed to Italy
to consider the proffer in her own in

fear concerning the entry of the

"We must hurry and obtain a solid

That beautiful, even shade of dark,
flossy hair can only be i'ad by brew

it fades, turns gray or streaked, just
an application of two of Sage and Sul

recipe improved by the addition of;

can always be depended upon to;

Everybody ' uses "Wyeth's" Sage

it darkens so naturally and evenly!
that nobody can tell it lias bi n :i

or soft brush with it and draw tis
through the hair, taking one small
strand at a time; by morning the
gray hair has di.ppeared, and after
another application it becomes beau
fuily dark and appears glossy and

GREAT ALASKAN PLAY
CENTRAL FILM TODAY
The synopsis of "The Kingdom of
Love," the Alaskan film at the Cen
tral today, indicates that the film is
replete with interest, as there are ex
citing incidents in number and many
chances for Jewel Carmen to portray
her ability as an emotional actress.
The synopsis follows:
Into the north, among the gold seek
ers, comes a father and a daughter
f Jewel Carmen). The father had left
his wife and son destitute. In this
rough company the girl meecs and
turns aside many temptations. Years
later ccmes a youth and a minister.
Both are attracted by this girl who
has grown beautiful. One day the
youth gets a letter. He must return
home. His mother is 11! and needs
him and money for an operation to
save her life. The lad shows the
letter to the girl who discovers that
the youth is her brother. Waivinc
aside every thought of self and with
out telling the lad who she is, she
goes to the town dance hall and to
get the money for her mother of rs
herself in marriage to the liiphost
bidder. A vile old miner tries to bid
her in but tlie minister offers more
and gets her.
He borrows the money from the ;
dance hall proprietor on condition j
that if he does not pay it back within
a certain time he is to be the willing i
slaxe of the proprietor. The ninisier
goes to dig gold. The dance ball
proprietor. Vvhose business lie Hiss
hurt, conspired to put him out of the
way hut the girl heroically saves the
minister. The dance hall man is killed
in the fight to get the minister and
the minister is free of his debt. Of
course he marries the girl.
