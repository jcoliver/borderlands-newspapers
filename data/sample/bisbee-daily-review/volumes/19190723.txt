With the arrest of 44 more citizens

early this morning for Douglas, ser
vice of warrants here having been
practically completed last night.
Eighteen residents of Douglas, In
cluded in the Brown charge, will be
formally notified of their arrest on
the sheriff's arrival.
A touch of color was added to the
situation with the advent here yester
day afternoon of two motion picture
men, who shot a quantity of film
about the police court and city
streets, wherever the defendants on
the Brown charges gathered. The
city received the camera men in hol

afternoon placed a huge- placard over
its locked doors reading:

WASHINGTON'. July 22. The kid
naping of Lawrence L. Shipley, an
American citizen, by Mexican ban
dits near Fresnillo, Mexico, last Sat.
urday, was reported today to the
state department. Shipley is a nat
ive of Yerington, Nev.
The department had no other de
tails on this latest attack on an
American citizen in Mexico but the
official announcement of the occur
rence said an investigation had been
obtained.
The report, coming as it did, close
ly after the attack and robbery of a
boat load of American sailors near
Tampico and the receipt of informa
tion yesterday of the robbery ot
about $10,000 from the Puerto Lobos
station of the Atlantic Refining com

circles resulting from attacks on
American citizens and property in

FLETCHER BEFORE HOUSE
WASHINGTON. July 22. Al
thought about fifty American citi
zens have been killed or outraged In
Mexico since 1917. not a single arresti
or conviction is known to have re
sulted. Henry P. Fletcher, U. S. am
bflssador to old Mexico, . told . the
house rules committee in a hearing
to day on the Gould resolution pro
pesing appointment of a committee
to investigate relations between the
two countries.
The ambassador laid before thd
committee a report compiled by the
state department in response to a
senate, inquiry, showing that since

deportation scenes were Carl Wai
len, veteran International 'Film Ser
vice man of Mexico, Cuba, New York,
San Francisco, and way points, anu
O. A. Aultman, star camera artist for
the Pathe service. "The celluloid ex
perts were delighted at their arrival
in the district on a day offering 6uctt
splendid opportunity to "shoot" the
Warren District Business men, profes
sional men, miners and mine officials,
in the very act of struggling in thu
meshes of the law. The alleged
"kidnapers" proved accommodating,
but it was all done without a make
up and both Wallen and Aultman de
clared the chief value of the pictures
will be the portrayal throughout thu
United States of what the hardened
Bisbee "criminals" look and act like
without their eyebrows blacked ana
minus their false mustaches.
Through the courtesy of Thorleif
Olsen, manage!- of the Slag Dump
garage, who placed at their disposal
a big Oldsmobile car, the movie men
were able to make speedy trips from
spot to spot, missing nothing that
went on in connection with the depo
tation cases. They "shot" banker
and business men tacking up "gonw
to see the sheriff" signs over their
office doors as they hastened to tho
police court to get their warrants ana;
offer their "liberty bonds" in ex
change for the privilege of continu
ing to walk the streets of the district
they developed and built up; they
"shot" the defendants as they
thronged the police court, and as they
received the warrants charging them
with kidnaping.
"The setting was thrilling enougn
to make a director of the woolieat
western thriller that ever thrilled In
the breats of the erudite but unin
formed Easterner turn green with
envy," was the unanimous verdict of
the movie men. "And the best part of
it is there was no stage business
about this. We caught 'era all with
their make-ups off."
Wallen- and Aultman will remain in
Bisbee and vicinity for several days
filming incidents of the deportation
cases. Today they will go to Doug
las to shoot scenes at the prelimina
ry hearings to be conducted there be
fore Justice Jacks.
250 attacks of a serious nature have
been made on American citizens in
Mexico.
Relations , between, the two coun
tries have, . however, Mr. Fletcher
said. Improved during the last three
years. He added that there was a
"wonderful submisison" to Carranza
rule in all the sections which the
government controls. Although de
clining to express an opinion as to
the policy either past or future ot
this country towards Mexico, the
ambassador in effect opposed sug
gestions advanced by members of the
committee looking to withdrawal by
the U S. of recognition of the Car
ranza government.
At present, Mr. Fletcher -said, there
was no revolutionary leaders In
Mexico with sufficient following to
overthrow the existing government
and set up a stable one.
"Would the permission of this gov
ernment to all Mexicans to secure
arms and ammunition furnish these
anti-Carrahza leaders aid?" asked
Chairman Campbell.
"That would have the effect of in
creasing the turmoil in Mexico," re
plied the ambassador, "whether 'It
would ultimately result in a govern
ment more stable, thin this ne,
more able ' to discharge its interna
tional obligations or not, I am - not
prepared to say."
Ambassador Fletcher said he had
noticed no special anti-American sen
timent or discrimination against na
tionals of this country in favor ol
those of other nations. Mexican
newspapers, however, during the
war, he said, were very hostile to
warda the United States.

tional Guard organization, which was
part of the 40th division. He had
done recruiting duty for the regiment

Mrs. Smith said soon after her mar
riage she heard Smith was harsh with
his men and' that some of thm sent
her word of their troubles with him.

be less severe, but "he seemed to de
light in his attitude."
Soon after the regiment went to
Prance. Smith obtained charge of the
prison farm near Chelles-Sur-Marne,
according to his wire.
This farm became known among sol
diers as the "Hell Hole of France,"
according to reports.

gan the congressional Inquiry into the
prison camp, according to dispatches
received here, said,, he had been in
formed the ' only ' punishment Smith
had received for harshly treating sol
diers was dishonorable discharge from
the serves. . Mrs. Smith today said
Smith wtoU her not long ago he had
been sentenced to 18 months' impris
onment In addition to losing his com
mission. Threats against Smith by returned
soldiers had bn made to her, Mrs.

and another white man slashed ' se
verely by a razor, wielded by a ne
gro. All of the negro assailants es
caped. The outbreaks were sporadic ana
confined to a single vicinity in the

of the city.
Tonight's casualties brought the
number resulting from the rioting to
seven persons dead, 11 believed to be
fatally wounded, and scores injured.

RILL EOR DRY
E
House Vote Nearly 3 to 1 In
Favor of Stringent Measure;
Wets Are Forlornly Hoping
For Veto By the President
WASHINGTON, July 22. By a
vote of nearly three to one, the
house, weary of talk on prohibition,
today passed a bill for its enforce
ment, with provisions and penalties
so drastic as to bring from the men
who framed it the prediction that it
would forever suppress the liquor
traffic on American soil.
One hundred members, 52 Demo
crats and 48 Republicans, refused tOj
support it. Against the even hun-j
dred, the prohibitionists, putting upj
a solid front to the very last, polled '
287 votes, and just as the result wasj
announced a little girl in the gallery,!
too young to know what it "was all '
about, leaned over the railing and
waved a tiny American flag. It was
not a signal for that, but the house
broke into applause, the galleries,
only half filled, meanwhile looking
on In silence.
The cloak rumor persisted, that all
of this legislation might end on the
shoal of a presidential veto, al
though the general view was that it
would be signed as passed.
Before the house put the, bill on its
final passage one final but feeble
hand was reached forth to strike It
down and put in its place a briefer
and more liberal measure.
This took the form of a three-par
agraph bill by Representative Igoe,
Democrat, ' Missouri, : introduced some
days ago, and offered in a former mo
tion to re-commit, which meant Us
substitution for the general enforce
ment measure, if the house saw fit.
But the house did not. Mr. Igoe's
motion was defeated 255 to 136. and
this vote analyzed meant that at
least 36 members who favored a
more libera.l bill took the more dras
tic one later when there was no oth
er choice.
There were no unexpected revers
als In the individual vote. Represen-I
tative Husted, Republican, New
York, who voted as a member of the
judiciary committee to . report out
the bill, was . recorded against it,
while Representative Clasen, Repub
lican, Wisconsin, who signed the mi
nority report was recorded for it.
Representative Pou,, Democrat, North
Carolina.- an ardent prohibitionist,
voted against the bill after having,
pointed out that law so severe as'
not to permit a farmer's wife to make
a bottle of blackberry wine for herj
own u. would never he enforced.

COPPER
SLIDING SCALE IS INCREASED Br
75 CENTS PER DAI, THOUGH PRICE
Notices to Be Posted Today Advising Workmen of Warren
District and at Douglas Smelters of Increase; Step is
Taken By Copper Companies On Account of High Cost
Of Living; Raise In Globe-Miami Mine District Also
Notices will be posted today advis
ing workmen at the mines in the War
ren District' and at the smelters at
Douglas of an increase in wages, ef
fective July 16th, Grant H. Dowell,
general manager of the Copper Queen
branch of the Phelps-Dodge corpora
tion, announced here last evening.
The former sliding scale based on the
price of copper is maintained in prin-
ciple, but on account of the continued
, high cost- of living, the companies
I have decided to pay wages for the
! latter half of July, based on a quota
: tion of 24 cents per pound for copper.
The wage scale is based on the
price of copper for the previous
month. While the average for the
past three or four months has been
well under 18c per pound, the com
panies have been paying on the 1S
cent basis. The quotation for June
was under 18c, and a strict obser
vance of the scale would have given
no increase in July. The companies
appreciate living costs have not de
clined as expected, and feel that it is
no more than right to raise wages
now, which has been done by announc
ing the adoption of a higher quota
tion than the actual, and the quota
tion of 24 cents, announced by the
r - . i . . .
companies as me uasis ior wages aur
ing the latter half of the month ap
pears eminently fair.
This will mean an increase under
the sliding scale of 75 cents per day
in most cases and 60 cents per day
in case of Mexican employes.
In addition to the increase, if the
quotation for copper goes above 25
cents, wages will be further increased
in accordance with the sliding scale.

OF JULY
UNDER 18C.
Butte miners last week received an
increase of wages, and agreed to a
wage for the coming year of $5.75
per day, regardless of the price of
copper. But the companies here and
at Jerome and Globe-Miami have con
cluded to establish a differential of
50 cents per day between the miner
and the mucker, not by paying the
mucker less, but the miner more. Un
der this arrangement the mucker will
receive the 75 cent raise, making his
daily wage $5.60 for the last half of
July, and the miner will receive $1
raise, making hla wage 50 cents higher
than the mucker, or $6.10 per day.
Other underground men and mechan
ics will alos receive an increase of $1
per day.
All employes paid a monthly salary
will be given an increase of 15 per
cent of their base rate.
The recent strength shown in the
copper market indicates liberal buy
ing ,and a much more rapid liquida
tion of existing stocks . than was
thought possible a few months ago.
No doubt this will stimulate produc
tion again and more men will
be needed in this camp. This new
wage is by far th highest ever paid
miners in Arizona, or any other cop
per camp, when copper was not selling
well above 25 cents per pound, and
with living conditions here the best
in the west, it should not be difficult
for the companies to secure the com
petent miners needed.

SENATE REJECTS
WILSON REQUEST
ON HUH TREATY
"WASHINGTON, July 22. An em
phatic negative was returned by the
senate foreign relations committee
today to President Wilson's request
that it approve provisional appoint
ment of au American reparation rep
resentative on the international rep
aration commission without waiting
ratification of the peace treaty.
While the president was renewing
his talks with Republican senators
at the White House and the senate
was beginning another day of speecn
making on the treaty, the committee
introduced a resolution declaring no
power exists to execute provisions of
the treaty in advance o" its ratifies
tion. This was interpreted as no?
only refusing assent to the appoint
ment but as declaring the presiden.
will be exceeding his authority should
he act independently.
.What the president might do In
view of the committee action had not
bee revealed tonight, but most of his
advisers predicted there will bo no
appointment for the present. In max
ing his request the president had de
clared it essential k American bus
iness interests for this, nation to be
represented on the commission which
will have charge of the entire rep
ration program to be demanded o
Germany. The resolution was pro
pared by Senator Knoxr Republican,
Pennsylvania, and was substituted by
an eight to seven vote for another
expressing no opposition to the pret
ident's power to act.
The league also was supported by
Senator Johnson, South Dakota, ana
Breckham, Kentucky, both Demo
crats, the former declaring his only
objection was that the covenant did
not to far enough in forcing mainte
nance of peace and the latter 'urging
that it at least must be given a trial
and could be perfected later.

I want to tell everybody about Tanlac."
said . Mrs. Margaret Jurich. of 522' O

representative recently. Mrs. Jurich has
been a resident of Sacramento for the
past nine years.
"For the last year or two I have been
suffering from a generally rundown con
dition." continued Mrs. Jurich. "It jusj
seemed like everything I would eat would
sour in my stomach and bloat me up with
gas and I would be in perfect misery for
two or three hours after eating, and
sometimes the gas would press so around
my heart that I would get terribly weak
and feel go faint that I could hardiy stand
up. I was also troubled with awful pains
in my right side in the lower part of my
back and I got so I couldn't sleep well
at night and would be so nervous some
times that the least little thing would
upset me completely and make me very
Irritable. I was bothered with constipa

certain times in every month that I wou'3
just suffer agony and would not be able
to do my housework at all. Then, too.

my feet felt cold all the lime and some
times I would feel numb all over.
"I was in just this condition when a
friend of mine told me about Tanlac and
wlunt it had done for some of her friends.
so I decided to tryit. and it certainly
started right in to helping me irom the
very first. Vly appetite picket! up won
derfully and I quit liaving- tro'.Uile with
my stomach, and I -haven't -been bother
ed with gas pressing on my heart since.
I am not troubled with constipation lik
I was and my blood, circulation has im
proved, because my; feet don't feel cold
now and I don't have that numb feeling
any more. My headaches are a thing of
I the past, and so are the pains I used to
have In my side and back and I am not
nervous like I used to be and I sleep
like a child at night. Tanlac has cer

Even the best recipe can't make allowances for the
way sugar will harden into candy or for the failure of
a jelly to "jell".
Thousands of women are finding the ideal preserving
syrup is a blend of i Karo (Red Label) with xt sugar
instead of all sugar. Preserving done this way is always
uniform jelly that really "jells" jam that is neither
too syrupy nor too thick.
It gives you preserves with the natural fresh fruit flavor.
This fine, clear Karo Syrup has a natural affinity for
the juices of the fruit. It blend3 the fruit with the sugar
makes your syrup rich and heavy, and holds jams and jellies
firm and mellow, with not the slightest tendency to "candy"
in the glass.
For Cooking, Baking and Candy Making Karo (Red
Label) is used in millions of homes. In all cooking and
baking recipes use Karo instead of sugar. It is sweet, of
delicate flavor, and brings out the natural flavor of the food.

LINCOLN MS BORDER TITLE FROM
GUHDY IN FAST 1D-RDUND BATTLE
Crowd of 1500 Bisbee Fans Witness Bout of Furious Action,

Til say they fought." was the uni

association at the Grandn.hen.ter.
The preliminaries, out.sfae of that by
the two Ziimsteg brothers, age 11 and
13 respectively, were tame and the men
not well matched. The fans were more
than recompensed, however, by the great
exhibition put up by Lincoln and Gundy
from the tap of the gong In the first
round to the finish at the tenth. Lin
coln was given the decision by P.eferee
George, but to all the fans it was a toss
up from the starf to the finish, Lincoln
having the shade the best of it in the
majority of the rounds.
Gundy of El Paso, who up to last night
was the champion of the border in the
featherweight class, was a real match
for the clever and hard-hitting Lincoln
of Los Angeles. Xot a round went by
but both boys fought hard and displayed
real science. Some or the cleverest in
fighting seen in any fights in this vicin
ity was shown in every round. A knock
out was the only way that either fighter
could i ave been stopped, and the clev
erness and ring generalship of both pre
vented the K. O. being slipped out.

during last night. Gundy, who has won
the majority of his victories by K. O.'s
directly traceable to the stomach route,
was working on Lincoln's stomach over
half of the time but to no visible effect.
Lincoln proved that he was the cleverest
boxer of the two by the quick getaways
and blocking of terrific haymakers aimed
for the jaw and stomach by Gundy. In
the sixth round Lincoln succeeded in go
ing through Gundy's guard and landing a
stiff one on the left eye, which while
not cutting in. blackened Gundy's orb
as a souvenir of the entertainment.
A return match of Oundy and Lincoln
should prove a real event, as 1xth boys
are clean, hard fighters, end mix real
cleverness and ring generalship in with
their puncHes. The bout last night was
the. second decision , that Lincoln has
been awarded in Bisbee fights. The oth

July fight with Eobby Burns.

Public Needs and' Public
Obligations
THE ability of a public utility to ' serve the, public
depends upon the attitude of the community toward
the utility.
The initial appearance of a needed utility in a community
is always cordially welcomed. It is recognized not only
as filling a decided want, but also as an evidence of the
growth and development and prosperity of the community.
So long as appreciation of the utility finds expression in
the public's willingness to grant to the enterprise revenues
adequate to meet its honest requirements under efficient
management, so long will the utility be able to serve the
public satisfactorily. ' :
But there must be mutual understanding and mutual ' confidence.
Neither a public nor a private enterprise can build permanent success
upon revenues derived from a public that has no faith in nor respect
for the institution. t
The utility's obligation is to serve; the public's obligation , is to create
such conditions as will make it possible for the utility to serve.
The Telephone Company is subject to the same economic laws and
principles as those governing other industries. The permanency and
adequacy of telephone service depend upon the same factors as are
involved in the security and permanency of every other established
industry. -
; i
i
Mutual understanding of each other's needs and mutual willingness
to supply such needs will insure adequate and efficient service to the
public and financial security to the Company.

AGAIN THE DEPORTATION CASES.
THE PRELIMINARY hearings in the deportation cases went
over yesterday in the justice court of V. C. Jack to allow the
justice to go to Bisbee find take bonds of nearly three hun
dred defendants, many of whom had been previously arrested
and relased under bond. The reason lor this extra work on the part
of the justice and the inconvenience to defendants was because the
original complaints were faulty and had to be redrawn by the county
attorney. Lack of witnesses needed by the defense delayed the com
tion of several cases this week and lost one entire day. With the
great number of cases filed by the county attorney and with the
slow progress being made with the preliminary hearings no one may
estimate the time these cases will require for even their preliminary
disposition in the justice court to say nothing about the heavy drain
they will make on the funds of the county which we are informed are
to pay the expenses of, the indigent witnesses called to court. .
During the continuance of these preliminary hearings the county
attorney is necessarily kept away from his office and allowing his
deputies to attend to the duties of that office during his absence.
These duties themselves are monumental when it is known that
some eighty or ninety criminal cases are awaiting trial in the .supe
rior court in Tombstone.
It is not lor' this paper to say who shall be prosecuted in . this
county for crime;' that is a matter for which the entire responsibility
must rest on the county attorney. He ha3 caused proceedings to bo
instituted which if carried through will cost the county a great dea
of money and will keep alive animosities which will result in na
benefit to the county.
It is well known that the deportation of the I. W. W. members
and their sympathizers occurred and that some one was responsibla
for it; this goes without saying; the law may have been violated by
those responsible for the deportation, but the general belief in this
county has not been that one hundred or two hundred or perhaps
more than twenty-five men had any knowledge or imagined what was
going on in Bisbee until the train pulled out of Warren on July 12,
1917. Many men had been commissioned as deputy sheriffs during
the strike brought on by the I. W. W. in Bisbee, but we doubt if only'
a very few had been informed of any deportation plan.
It will be remembered that the United States department of jus
tice started the first criminal cases against those accused of being
responsible for the Eisbee deportations; the government caused to
be indicted twenty-two men. The government has a great more
money than Cochis-3 county to wage a prosecution against those
charged with the Bisbee deportation, but it would appear that the
government officials felt that all that would be possible would be to
try those it regarded as probably the most responsible for what oc
curred. The government indictments were quashed and these cases
are now in the United States supreme court on appeal. Besides this
criminal prosecution of the government hundreds of damage suits
have been filed by the men taken out of Eisbee against about every
one in Bisbee who are suspWoned of having any money, including
all the mining companies. .The total of these claims for damages we
are told amount to several million dollars and they must all be tried
at the expense and time of the courts of this or some other county
in the state.
As stated a few days ago we have always regarded the deporta
tion at Bisbee as an incident of the war. While we believe that the
I. W. W. leaders boldly planned to stop copper production in Bisbee
for the purpose of injuring the government during the time of its
strenuous need to win victory over the Hun we have never believed
that many pf the individual I. W. W. members were aware of this
purpose to serve the Germans; only the leaders were on the Inside
and in league with the German propagandists. On the other hand
we do not believe that any considerable number of those who carried
a gun in Bisbee on July 12, 1917, kaew what was coming off when
they were called on by the sheriff to help him secure and guard the
men taken out of Bisbee that day. That the deportation was care
fully planned there can be no doubt, but to say that every man who
responded to the call of the sheriff had knowledge of it is to stretch
the imagination beyond reason, ia our opinion. iDouglas International).

HERE'S THE ALIBI; BUT HOW ABOUT
THE EXPENSES?
C, OUNTY ATTORNEY R. X. French stated this morning that
the Daily International was in error in stating that faulty
j complaints had been used in the original arrests of defend
ants in the deportation cases. He said that rearrests and
new bonds were made necessary because of the use of wrong forms.
He said that originally three classes ot complaints were drawn and
printed covering the different character of cases and that the forms
used as the basis for the arrests were not the ones intended to be
used. This paper is g'ad to print the explanation of Mr. French about
how the additional expense and the time required for taking new
bonds occurred. (Douglas Daily International).
AU. S. AERIAL LEAGUE.
IF THE project of the Aerial League is Carried out, the United
States will soon see the use of the aeroplane as a pleasure
vehicle, and for those who can afford the experience an aero
plane trip will be one of the recreations open to consideration
when planning a vacation. The league, apparently taking its model
from the Glidden automobile tours, proposes to offer the vacationist
a choice of aeroplane tours ranging 'from one day's flying to four
teen or fifteen; the machines are to bo acquired from the surplus
stock which the United States government now has on sale, and
there are in the country many thousand former army and navy fliers
to provide the drives lor this aerial pleasure coaching. Whether or
not these "pioneer aerial tours" would find pioneer aerial tourists
enough to make the project pay its necessarily heavy expenses and
bhow a reasonable profit is another question. Considered practically,
comparatively few persons will yet get atourd an aeroplane with as
little hesitation as they will climb into a motor car, ,

committee, were unable to be pres

inite intention to so conduct the or
ganization as to make it the greatest
possible force for real progress in
the state and nation, was evident
throughout the meeting. No section
alism, no politics, no personal stuff,
just plain honest-to-goodness patriot
ic Americanism was the keynote.
One of the first matters to be tak
en up by the committee was the state
headquarters, which is to be located
in Phoenix, and where the state ad
jutant will be permanently stationed.
For this purpose it is the intention
of the Legion to erect here a suitable
building. The state commander, An
drew J. Martin, was authorized to ap
point a committee on the building
project, to devise ways and means
and raise the money necessary. The
committee will have a member from
each county, and will report to the
next meeting of the executive com
mittee, to be held here October 12.
The state adjutant was not select
ed, but it was decided to set his sal
ary at ?200 per month. Applications
for this position will be received by
the state commander up to August 1.
Iyouis S. Douglas, post commander
of the Jerome Post, was appointed
state finance officer. He is the son
of .1. S. Douglas. Ed Carrol, yard
master at Winslow, was appointed
sergeant-at-arnis. Tom E&"u ot Eis

rian of the Legion. Egan is secretary
of the Eisbee Chamber of Commerce.
Copies of the proceedings of the
state conference at Tucson and the
constitution adopted there will be or

placing before the vote of the share
holders an amendment to the articles
of incorporation permitting the asso

of cement, received the unanimaus
vote of 20 members of the council
present.
The second resolution, calling for
the expenditure of not more than
-$150,000 by the association for the
purchase of a cement plant now own
ed by the Phoenix Portland Cement
company, received one dissenting
vote.
Called by Secretary Van der Veer
for the purpose of taking action on
the recommendation cf the county
highway commission that the asso
ciation take over and operate the
cement plant and supply material for
constructing the $400,000,000 worth of;
county roads, the meeting of the
council or legislative body of the
project convened at 11 o'clock this
morning.
Frank R. Stewart was elected as
temporary chairman and E. E. Jack
acted as secretary. The first 'roll
call showed only 18 of the necessary
20 or two-thirds of the membership
present. Soon afterward two mere
members arrived and the majority
was thus attained. No proposed
amendment can be placed before the
Waters users before first receiving
the approval of two-thirds of the
council members.
Introduced by the chairman, Eu
gene Hackett, member of the county
highway commission, explained the
reasons why the commission had
proposed the taking over of the ce
ment plant by the association. Ha
told how after the people of Marico
pa county had given their approval by
a 9ier cent vote of $4,000,000 road
program, the commission had writ
ten to all the cement plants this side
of the Mississippi river asking
about the possibilities for getting ce
ment for the county road work.
"The replies we got from the ce
ment people.' Hackett explained,
"were as amusing as Charlie Chap,
lin. Most of them were evasive and
many advised us to wail and buy ce
ment later on when it would be
cheaper. Some advised us to buy
nearer home. The upshot of ihe re
plies was that they were unable to
supi'ly us with the needed cement
at the present time. The price gen
erally was quoted at $4 a barrel, f.

CARSON AND THE AMERICAN
MISSION.
New York World.
I!y his offensive remarks In regard to
the I nited States. Sir Kdward Carson
proves himself a fair rival of the "Amer
ican mission" whose visit to Ireland has
excited his wrath. Their common ob
ject in life seems to be first to stir up
bitter strife among the Irish people and
then to create ill-feeling among outsiders.
This is the one point on which they are
in agreement. It Is Ireland's
misfortune to suffer through the actions
of the agitators who lead Its hostile fac
tions. Until Irishmen themselves learn
to settle their quarrels at home, it would
be wiser for them not to embroil other
peoples whose sympathy they profess to
desire.

by the speaker; that where a real

BY REVIEW
STOCKS AND BONDS
NEW YORK, July 22. Stocks ral
lied substantially today from their se
vere setback of the previous session,
to the discomforture of an over con
fident short interest, which semed of
the opinion that technical conditions
favored a reversal.
Unusual activity was shown by the
second or low grade rails, over half a
score of which joined In the general
rise at gains of one to two points, but
dividend-paying rails were apathetic,
though decidedly firm. General news
was more encouraging and distinctly
helpful to the long account Call
money denoted increased ease. Metals
were quoted at yet higher prices.
The market paused for a brief pe
riod in the later dealings, but gath
ered renewed strength in the final
half hour, closing prices among the
leaders, including U. S. Steel being at
or within a fraction of the day's max
imum quotations. Sales amounted to
1,245,000 shares.
Trading in bonds was irregular on
smaller dealings, the Liberty group
holding steady and internationals
varying.
Total sales, par value, aggregated
$12,750,000. Old U. S. registered
bonds gained V on call, others were j
unchanged.
THE GRAIN MARKETS
CHICAGO. July 22. With hog
prices equalling the topmost level
ever touched, the corn market devel
oped corresponding strength and clos
ed firm, lc to 3c net higher, with
September $1.94 to $1.95, and De
cember $1.65 to $1.65. Oats gain
ed to lc and provisions 12c to
60c. Corn followed the steep ascent
maintained by the hog market. Even
if there had been no other impetus
than the action of hog values, buying
of corn would have been greatly stim
ulated. As a matter of fact, however,
the bulls put much stress also on re
ports of crop damage said to have al
ready resulted from pervailing dry,
hot weather. Advices from the south
west told of leaves curling and of bot
toms firing because of the lack of
moisture. At the same time, forecasts
gave no indication of relief during the
next two days.
Despite want of export demand,
oats took an upward swing with corn.
Country offerings were mainly held
higher than the market.'
Provisions derived strength from
grain and hogs. Business, however,
was of only a scattered sort

ed steady at a net advance of 33 to

To many motorists even among- those
who profess to know by first name every
working- part of their oar the construc
tion of tires is wholly unknown. This is
particularly true reardine cord tires. It
is not; uncommon to find a full fledfed
"motor bue" who insists on havine cord
tires 'because they ride easier and last
longer." yet he hasn't the sliKhtest con
ception of what constitutes the difference
between a cord tire and a fabric.
The ,Fisk Rubber company of OhJropee
Talis. MasB., makers of Fiek Cord Tires,
are authority for the following definition
of the cord principle.
"The cord tire 'is a comparatively new j
departure in tire manufacture. It follows
upon years of experience in the making j
of fabric tires, during which time care- i
ful scientific study was given to thp most J
trivial detail of tire construction. The
effect of speeds, loads, traction surfaces,
heat of friction and the composition of
materials all figured into the development
of the present day tire.
"Out of all this comes the cord principle
which is an even greater Btep forward
than was the invention of the first pneu- I
ma tic tire.
"Kisk Cord Tires are made up of layer
on layer of parallel diagonal cords, each
layer alternating in direction. But before
the carcass 1b '.built up, each layer is
treated with a preparation of gum rub
ber sufficient in quantity and properly
compounded to make a soft pliable cush
ion of rubber between each layer of cords
When the completed casing is finally vul
canized. "It's all in the principle, combined, of
course, with correct manufacturing prac
tice. All of these factors are carefully
worked out in the making of the Flsk
Cord tire to the extent that mileages

And in his simple shaving kit may still be seen his equally simple

never been bettered in heft, or shearing width, or right shav

At such times when his old servant failed him, Washington
