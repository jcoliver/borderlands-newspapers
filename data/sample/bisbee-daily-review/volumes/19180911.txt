Cochise county sprang a number

supporters were surprised and dis

Colter, who, though not carrying
the county apparently will run but
little behind the local governor
ship candidate. Osborn was a bad
third.
Sutter's friends were counting
on his going out of thi8 county
with a heavy lead. Early in the
voting they commenced to con
cede his defeat.
The sheriffs race which was a
close second in the public interest,

Capt I. R. McLendon, Cc
,om-

Field Artillery, Writes Facts
for History
NEW YORK. Sept. 10. The
story of the first shot fired by the
American expeditionary force in
the war with Germany a shell
sent schrecching into the German
lines about as dawn was breaking
on Oct. 23, 1917 is contained in a
letter sent to The Associated Press
by the commander of the Indiana
battery which performed this im
portant action in American his
tory. Alex Arch of South Bend.
Ind., a sergeant in this unit bat
tery C of the Sixth field artillery
is the veteran soldier who. ac
cording to this letter, yanked the
lanyard of the pioneer gun so
speak for the United States on the
soil of France.
Newspaper correspondents who in
spected the gun on the day lt was
fired wer permitted at the time to
say In their cablegrams only that this
sergeant was from South Bend. The
honor of firing this first shot had been
claimed by another member of the
same battery. Capt. Indus R. McLen
don, In command of battery C, in writ
ing of this event, expresses his con
viction that the people of the United
States should have available an au-
thoritative account both because of the i
significance of the deed and because I
SERGEI
ARCH
in his opinion credit should go to the'purpoie of enabling all Mexican's to
man whom the officers of battery C
say it is due Sergt. Alex Arch. Ser
geant Arch or South Bend is the man
who puJled the lanyard and sent the
first American shot into the hostile
lines on the morning of Oct. 23, 191 r,
at five minutes past 6, Captain Mc
Lendon says.
"I was present during all the filing
of that morning.
"In the gun drill the bunner, a cor
poral, lays the gun for direction only;
cannoneer No. 1 sets off the rang"
and at the command of the chief of
section, fires the piece. The chief of
section merely repeats the command,
'fire,' which is ordinarily given by the
lieutenant who acts as battery execu
tive officer.
"On this particular morning. Arch
had a special gun crew made up of
the other sergeants who were in com
mand of gun sections in the battery,
all or whom were anxious to have a
hand in the job. Arch himself set off
the range and acted as No. 1, pulling
the lanyard at my command Tire.' "
Twenty-four shots were fired that
morning. Captain McLendon continued
and added:
"The firing of he first shot was
an event which our division command
er. General , considered worthy of
special mention and record, and order
ed the shell cases of the first eight
shots sent to his headquarters with a
iew to their preservation. Later the
commander-in-chief ordered the gun
which fired the first shot to be with
drawn from service and I understood
that It has been, or will be, sent to
the states to be kept as a relic of the
great war."

EL PASO. Tex., Sept. 10.-
rush of Mexican laborers return
ing to Mexico for fear of being in
ducted into the United Slates
army, caused Brig. Gen. J. J.
Horn brook, district commander,
to issue a proclamation today as
suring the Mexican nationals that
the act of regtration Thursday
would not induct them into the
army. At the Mexican general
consulate today it was stated an
average of 300 Mexicans daily
were applying for; passports to
return to Mexico. Many are com
ing from Kansas, Pennsylvania,
California and other interior
states where they have been en
gaged in farming, mining and oth
er essential occupations.
General Horn brook's proclama
tion, in Spanish, was printed to
day in all Mexican, newspapers
and shown on moving picture
screens in the Mexican quarter in
an effort to stop theexodus of
Mexican laborers.
Fcr several days German propagan
da have been busy circulating rumors
among the Mexican population about
the registration. These rumors are
baseless, malicious and untrue. As a
resuit some of them are quitting un
iisur.lly profitable employment, sacri
ficing their property and other inter
ests and leaving with their families
for Mexico.
This proclamation Is issued for the
clearly understand the policy of the
United States government in this mat
ter. The selective conscription law re
quires the registration of all male res
idents on Sept. 12. 1918, between the
ages of IS and 21 and. 31 and 45. Reg
istration, however, is not conscription.
Rumors that Mexican citizens will
be drafted are false.
This applies like-. !
wise to aliens of all other countries
Do not sacrifice your interests because
of false German propaganda. Regis
tration is required, but that means
protection for aliens from the draft.
All that is necessary for a Mexican
citizen to do to secure exemption is
to establish his Mexican citizenship.
Officials, attorneys and other patriot
ic citizens will assist those Mexicans
who do not understand our language
to prepare their questionaires in which
their claim for exemption will be prop
erly set out.
In order to properly establish your
Mexican citizenship, those who can
do so should have with them their
birth certificate. In the event that
this certificate is not at hand, it is
suggested that you secure affidavits
from two reliable witnesses concern-1
ing your birth place or such other evi-1
dence as Is available. Citizenship can j
also be established by the fact that j
you have been properly matriculated i
at your nearest Mexican consulate.
Ibor at this time is being paid
unheard-of prices. Employment Is I
plentiful. Business conditions are good I
and the country is prosperous. Those!
who remain in addition to benefitting
themselves will be "doing their bit"
toward winning the war against an-1
tocracy. ft is the desire of the gov-
ernment to continue to extend to Klex-
leans all the rights and liberties which I
have heretofore influenced them to
come within our borders. )
Do not be deceived by these or oti.er :

ROLL GALL FOR
MEMBERSHIP FOR
RED GROSS SOCIETY
HENRY DAVIDSON ANNOUNCES
DRIVE FOR ADDITIONAL MEM
BERSHIP TO BE CONDUCTED IN
WEEK OF DECEMBER 16 TO 23;
EVERYONE TO BE SOLICITED
Henry P. Davison, chairman of the
war council, announces that in the
week of December 16 to 23, inclusive,
there will be a Christmas roll call of
the whole American people for mem
bership in the American Red Cross.
Mr. DavlBon authorized this state
ment: "From December 16 to 23, lists
will be open for every American :u
every corner of the world so that it
may be known that the whole nation
at home and abroad is registered for
the cause. The American Red Cross
wants again to give the world notice
not only that America can fight, but
that to the last man, woman and child
we stand for mercy, honor and good
faith among nations.
"At the close of the Christmas mem
bership campaign of 1917, there were
22.000.UOO Americans enrolled in the
American Red Cross. There are also
8.000.000 members in the Junior Red
Cross. This year both as a Christmas
observance and as a renewal of the
nation-wide pledge of loyalty, the
American Red Cross will again put be
fore everyone the duty of standing by
the flag; for the American Red Cross,
in this great fight for peace, repre
sents the whole spirit of what we are
fighting for.
"This will not be a call for money.
It will be a summons, to Americans
everywhere to line up for the Amer
ican ideal. We can not all" fight but
this one thing everybody can, do. The
American Red Cross membership fee
is $1. Half of this remains with the
local chapter to be used foe expenses
and for relief of our soldiers and their
families; the other half goes to the
national treasury.
"There will be no allotment of quo
tas to a community. The quota in ev
ery district will be the limit of its
adult population. When the roll call
comes every American, old- or young,
will be called on to register and add
the weight of his name to the Red
Cross message. Let us answer with
one voice to the word of President
Wilson when he said 'I summon you to
the comradeship.' "
HEED THE WARNING
Many Bisbee People Have Done So.
When the kidneys are weak they
give unmistakable warnings that
should not be Ignored. By examin
ing the urine and treating the kidneys
upon the first sign of disorder, many
days of suffering may be saved. Weak
kidneys usually expel a dark, ill-smell-liig
urine, full of "brlckdust" sediment
and painful in passage. Sluggist kid
neys often cause a dull pain In the
small of the back, headache, dizzy
spells, tired, languid feelings and fre
quent rheumatic twinges.
Doan's Kidney Pills are for the kid
neys only. There Is no better recom
mended remedy.
Bisbee people endorse Doan's Kid
ney Pills.
- J. R. Covington, miner. School hill,
Bisbee," says: "Doan's Kidney Plls
can't be beaten' and I gladly-recommend
them. - Three months ago my
back was in bad shape and when I
tried to bend over, sharp pains would
catch me and I could hardly straigh
ten again. My kidneys were weak and
bothered me a whole lot, too. Doan's
Kidney Pills soon cured me."
Price 80 cents, at all dealers. Don't
simply ask for a kidney remedy get
Doan's Kidney Pills the same that
Mr. Covington had. Foster-Mllburn

BY REVIEW
NEW Y'ORK. Sept. 10. Stocks were
nervous and unsettled again today. thi3
condition being geuerally ascribed to
the more stringent regulations respect
ing bank loans. Considerable liquida
tion was witnessed In the first hour,
many ' stop loss" orders being uncov
ered. Shcrts were Inclined to enlarge their
commitments, but selling of that char
acter was minimized by the attitude
or the exchange authorities, who open
ly discouraged professional operations
(or either account.
The tonnage report of the United
States Steel corporation for August
disclosing a nominal decrease, was
hardly a market factor.
In keeping with Us custom of many
years, steel furnished a preponderant
share of the dealings at an extreme de
cline or 1. Allied shares were 1 to
3 points lower at their worsL Rails
figured conspicuously in tne reversal.
Coppers. chippings( oil motors and
a varied assortment of specialties for
feited from 1 to 2 points, but hardened
with steel and other leaders in the
final hour, when many losses were
fully or largely recovered. Sales
amounted to 500.000 shares.
Bonds were irregular. Liberty issues
rallying after early concessins.
Dominion of Canada Ss of 1931 gain
ed a point, other Internationals show
ing no material change. Total sales.
t.ar value, aggregated $6,925,000. Old
United States bonds' were unaltered
on call.
GRAIN MARKET.
CHICAGO. Sept. 10. Big breaks In
the value of corn took place today ow
ing to the bearish Influence of the
government crop report, together with
failure of predicted frosts, and as a
result of railroad embargoes against
Ruffalo and Minneapolis. The finish,
although steady, was 2c to 3c net
lower, with October $1.54 to $1.54?i
and Nocember $1.53Ti to $1.54. Oats
lost c to lc. In provisions the out
come varied from 40c decline to 35c
advance.
Weakness in corn was pronounced
from the outset. The main Initial im
pulse to sell came from the govern
ment estimates of yield 72.000.000
bushels above what the trade had
looked for. Bearish sentiment through
out the day was also emphasized by
reports that the territory in which the
croo might be seriously injured by
frost had again scored a lucky escape.
In the final hour attention centered
chiefly on notices that railway con
gestion was acute at Minneapolis, and
was also affecting traffic on three
roads into Buffalo. Discouraged hold
ers made a consequent general rush
to sell and last prices were nearly at
the lowest point reached.
Oats, like corn, were bearlshly af
fected by the embargo, and by the
, government report.
! Provisions averaged lower with,
j despite a new high price record for
hogs.

The Germans Hold
Let us face 'the situation squarely. The
allied drive has slowed down and now bids
fair to stop short of any considerable dis
aster for the German armies. We had
just as well swallow our disappointment
and set our teeth and prepare for a long
series of grim fighting for short gains. That
is, unless Foch still elects to strike a giant
blow. This column admits intense disap
pointment over the failure of the British
astride the Arras-Cambrai road to take full
advantage of the panic the beaten German
troops in this sector and push on for a fin
ishing stroke. To stop these victorious
troops short of Douai on the north east and
Cambrai on the southeast seems to lose the
greatest fruits of that victory. Mangin still
threatens the Hun with disaster between
LaFere and the St. Gobain forest, but the
Germans are massed here with guns and
men and no progress at all was reported by
the French Monday. The Germans, it
seems, have elected to stand on the Hinden
burg line and their artillery thunders con
stantly now from that front. But the Hin
denburg line is pierced east of Arras and
southeast of LaFere and it is still possible
for the allies to hurl them back from this
famous defense line. But any check of the
allied advance this year short of Douai,
Cambrai, St. Quentin, LaFere and Laon.
means that our offensive has succeeded
only in pushing the enemy badly and shat
tering his powers of defense without, how
ever, having scored a real victory. The al
lies have simply won back this year that
which they had lost this year. The line
reverts back to last spring. A year of hard
fighting has left the allies right where they
began. BUT, it has used up that entire
million of reserves which the Germans
brought last winter from the Russian line.
A million Germans will march no more
and fight no more for .the kaiser. And he
will need them badly next spring. The al
lies have exacted full revenge for the re
verses of last spring, and there are no more
German reserves. It is the German who
faces the crisis now. And for him it is not
past, even though he seems to be stationary
now. Foch can strike and may strike with
tremendous force any day. He has a half
million eager Americans in leash. That
one more great battle will be fought before
snow flies may be expected as a certainty.
And that battle will decide the location of
the fighting line for winter.
To change suddenly from a policy of an
nihilation to a policy of self defense, that
is the change recorded by the clown quince
of Germany in a brief space of time. This
- young fire eater, who eagerly and joyfully
pointed the long range cannon on Paris and
. killed the first baby in this bombardment,
has been tamed and chastened since the sec
ond battle of the Marne. He would no
longer seek fresh conquests and fields of
destruction, but merely hold on to what he
has gained. Well, he may hold for a while,
but not long, brethren, not for long.
The French have LaFere almost in their
grasp. If they can win this city now, after
many desperate and futile attempts in the
past had failed disastrously, the achieve
ment will be a pretty clear index of the real
increase in the strength of the allies and the
corresponding decrease in the German
powers of resistenre. Be sure that the en
emy will leave nothing possible undone to
hold La Fere.
Baron Burian, speaking for the Central
Powers, has launched the first peace offens
ive of the early fall season. The baron
thinks it is a shame for the war to po on
with ronsrejurnt slaughter. If the baron
and his friends and co-laborers had been as
anxious for peace in th summer of 19! 4
as they are now, there would have been no
war. And no one heard the baron or any
of his German masters speak for peace in
the spring "when the allies were being
pressed back; that is for no peace except a
victorious peace.
That Hi- Y Night Course
i
The Hi-Y night course, which begins at
the Y. M. C. A. next Monday night to con
tinue for the winter season, will be more
complete and therefore more valuable this
year than ever before. It is so planned as
to offer no duplication with the course ob
tainable at the Bisbee high school. Among
the courses to be taught by most compe
tent and experienced teachers will be chem
istry, electricity, naturalization, machine
shop and lathe work, stenography, assay,
geology, mathematics, French and Spanish.
Every practical and helpful course to better
things for the ambitious man may be stud
ied at the Hi-Y night school. If opportun
ity, as they say, knocks but once at every
man's door, then it is knocking now on the
door of every man and boy in this district
who desirejs to, make his head help his
hands in the battle with the world, or if he
simply desires to make his hands more cun
ning and skillful and thus not depend upon
main strength and endurance alone. Do
you remember the immortal lines that
Ingalls wrote about Opportunity? In part
they run:
"Master of human destinies am I.
Cities and fields 1 wa'V,
I penetrate deserts and seas remote.
And passing, once I knock unbidden on every door.
If sleeping, wake! if feasting, rise.
They who follow me reach every state mortal desire
And conquer every foe save death.
It Is the -hour of fate!
But they who hesitate,
Condemned to penury, want and woe.
Call in vain and uselessly implore,
I answer not and I return no more."
Somehow the magic and compelling
words above seem to have been written to
point the moral and adorn the tale of this
very Hi-Y night course. Anyway they ap
ply. And only the sluggard will fail to an
swer the summons at his door next Mon
day when the course opens.

CARL HAYDEN OF ARIZONA
(From the Los Angeles Times.)
Carl Hayden, representative in congress
from Arizona, is forced to face his own
record in his campaign for re-election. Hay
den formed, with Randall of California and
a few others, the pacifist group in the na
tional house of representatives. Hayden
voted against the declaration of war against
Germany and his vote on other administra
tion war measures won for him the opposi
tion of the National Security league.
Arizona has never been noted for its paci
fist disposition and it is not easy to under
stand how a man of Hayden's type was
ever elected to congress by an Arizona
constituency. It is enough to make the
"Arizona Kicker" turn over in his grave.
Hayden voted against five of the six ad
ministration war measures ; his vote on the
other . has never been satisfactoriljr ex
plained. The republicans of Randall's Cali
fornia district have already repudiated him,
and his chances in the general election are
remote. It is to be hoped that the republi
cans of Arizona will do to Hayden what the
republicans of California have done to Randall.
Chicago Tribune: The soul of the I. W.
W. movement, as expressed in court by
Haywood and his co-defendants and un
denied elsewhere, is forceful interference
with normal, necessary, and extraordinary
measures for the public good; that if the
majority will not go their way, they will not
let the majority go its own way. Thus the
democracies of the world, were the I. W.
W. not put under some restraint, would
find themselves clinging ;to a pendulum
swinging between the extreme of royalist
and anarchist tyranny. A tyrant is no
more pardonable because he is a workman.
Tyranny is equally vicious in monarch and
man. And just when we find ourselves
employed with all our force and all our re
sources in impressing the doctrine of popu
lar government upon , the greatest tyran
nies, we discover ourselves menaced by a
smaller, but no less sinister, tyranny at
our very doorstep.
Rain, always the Germans' friend, has
come to their aid again. Incessant rain
storms have made the battle fields a quag
mire, except on the plateaus north of Sois
sons. Only once in the entire war has the
rain leen anything but the enemy of the
allies, and that was during the Austrian of
fensive on the Piave last spring when the
river was flooded and part of the advancing
armies cut off.

I Smith Feel Like New Man
I
Since Taking Tanlac
Suffered Thirty Years
One of the strongest and most con
vincing evidences of the popularity
of Tanlac throughout America is t;ie
large number of letters that are be-P
ing received daily from well known
men and women, telling of the re
markable results they have derived
from its use.
Among the many received in the
past few days is one from John Smith,
313 Eighth street. Richmond. Califor
nia, which is especially interesting.
Mr. Smith states that he had suffered
for twenty years, with his stomach,
liver and kidneys, and had reached
the point where he wished each
breath would be the last. He also says
that when he began taking Tanlac
he weighed only one hundred and forty-eight
pounds, but that he now
weighs cue hundred and sixty-two
making a gain of eighteen pounds
and that he ieels like a new man. Fol
lowing is his letter in full:
"To whom it may concern: I, the
undersigned, can truthfully say that
the wonderful medicine know n as
Tanlac has done more for me in thir
ty days time, than any other medicine
I have ever taken before in all my
life. I have been a sufferer from stom
ach, liver and kidney troubles for
twenty years. I have taken six bot
of Tanlac, and today I feel like a new
man.
"Before I started using Tanlac it
didn't make any difference what I
would eat or drink, it distressed me
so much that I wished the next breath
would be my last. Also when I start
ed taking this wonderful medicine, I
only weighed cue hundred and forty
eight pounds. Today 1 weigh one
hundred and sixty-six pounds have
gained eighteen pounds already and
am stiil gaining. Also before taking
Tanlac I couldn't sleep either night or
day, but now I average about nine
hours steady sleep and I have an ap
petite like a horse. I am now fifty
years of age and I can't praise Tanlac
too much for hat it has done for
me."
Tanlac is sold in Bisbee by J. M.
Ball, in Douglas by Douglas Drug com- j
pany, in Paradise by G. A. Walker, iu

Going on an afternoon hike is not
quite s easy a task as a number of
well-known Pisbee women imagined it
would be.
A company of about ten men and
women, among them being Miss Mar
garet Hoban, manager of the woman's
ready-to-wear department of the
Phelps-Dodge store; Miss Murphy of
the Fair store, and Mrs. Madigan and
daughter, Miss Anne, decided early
Sunday afteruoon to take a hike over
the rangp of mountiins near Lime's
peak, a proposal to which all yielded
and made what little preparation was
necessary. They started on their
climb about 4 o'clock, taking with
j them lemonade only.
After walking to the end of Quarrv
canyon, they took a narrow trail lead
j ing off to the left, making a way to the
j mountains ahead. When they climbed
;Ovrr two ranges of mountains on the
ether side of Lime's peak, they no-
ticed dark, heavy clouds shadowing the
sky. and some of the party resolved
I to turn back, b't the urging of the
i others, who were determined to climb
just one more range before returning
i home, the number was not broken, and
I ail continued to climb. At 8 o'clock.
when they wanted to return, they had
I lost their way. and did not know where
; to turn. Miss Hoban and a number of
women took the lead, leaving thoso
I who did not want to follow with them,
i It was 12 o'clock, and yet Miss Ho
I ban and her company were climbing
i with blistered feet and hands filled
1 with cacti thorns, never thinking to
turn back or rest for a few moments.
At 3 o'clock Monday morning they nt
last found themselves stepping on the
Higgins hill trai!. which runs from
the various leases on the mountain.
The ethers who remained behind, did
not get home until 6 o'clock.
No one was hurt, with the exception
of Miss Hoban, who fell a short dis
tance down the White Pear cliffs, at
the foot of Lime's peak, slightly bruis
ing herself, and Miss Murphy, also,
who was unable to return to work
Monday morning owing to the fact
that she was busy removing thorns
from her blistered feet and hands.
ADVICE TO AUTISTS.
Automobilists from Bisbee, it ap
pears, have been experiencing difficul
ty in ascertaining how to avoid a
rough stretch of road south of Higley,
on the state highway. This may be
avoided, according to Secretary
Welch of the Phoenix chamber of
commerce, who writes the local com
mercial club in regard to the matter,
by taking the first left hand turn lead
ing west after turning north at the
Little Ilutte, which is approximately
twenty-five miles south of Chandler
The rough stretch of road mentioned
is about five miles in length.

SOLDIER WRESTLER TAKES UP
CHALLENGE ISSUED BY DAGO
JOE AND WRESTLING MATCH
PROBABLY WILL BE STAGED
HERE IN IMMEDIATE FUTURE
That proud challenge of Dago Joe
to all wrestlers in this neck of the
woods did not go long unanswered.
Yesterday the husky form of George
('oiistantiu, the .Greek demon, filled
the doorway of the newspaper man's
den from pillar to post. The Greek
advanced to the desk with a tread that
shook the building, and in a soft, low
voice expressed his desire to come at
;rips with this Dago Joe person, any
old pli.ee. any old time, for either dol
lars or glory.
The Greek Demon is a soldier w'th
'he Twenty-second battalion of the U.
S. guard3 at Ixwell. He can be found
there in person or by mail, and his
t( mis are simple enough and broad
enough to .suit anyone who really
wants to wrestle. Best two out of
three falls, for a purse and side bet.
or for either one. this is the Greek
Demon's i style. His face is set in ce
ment and his eye is steady, and his
manner of speech indicates that he Is
very much in earnest.
The next move is up to Dago Joe,
over in Frisco, on the Pacific coast.
If he comes out here he will get a
warm reception in the desert, so saith
George Constantin, formerly of Greece
rnd nk Vnanud for hts prowess, ''The
Demon!"
