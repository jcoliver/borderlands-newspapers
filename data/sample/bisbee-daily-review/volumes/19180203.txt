THE BISBEE DAILY REVIEW, SUNDAY MORNING, FEBRUARY 3, 1918.
HOOPES
SOUNDS
FIRST CULL FOR
THE THIRD LOAN
J. V. Iloopes. deputy governor of the
I. S. Reserve bank mt Dallas, sound
ing the first preliminary call for the
third liberty Joan, has written the
banns of his district to prepare them
for the work ahead. Xo orator or writ
er can excel this banker in making a
strong and stirring appeal to true Am
erican hearts. 'Through courtesy of
the Bank of Bisbee the Review takes
pleasure in printing the full text of
the first call for the third loan as fol
lows :
"As the time approaches when the
Third Liberty Loan is to be raised, we
believe it timely and appropriate to
draw to your attention certain facts
which we consider of more than pass
ing interest and importance.
"The government is finding it nec
essary to call upon us three times
within a year to provide by subscrip
tions to Liberty Loans, and on several
occasions by the purchase of United
States Short Term Treasury Certifi
cates, -sums of money hitherto consid
ered of fabulous proportions. These
facts should impress upon us as no
mere words could do. the intense seri
ousness, the stern necessities of the
situation one unparalleled in the his
tory of this count rj or indeed of the
world.
"Continued acquaintance with the
more serious aspects of life is apt to
bree dindifference. and to distort our
mental vision. As the soldier shud
ders with horror at his first sight of
carnage but later becomes hardened
so are we apt to become complacent
under conditions which call actuaily
lor increasingly syenuous effort.
"The Liberty Loan with its original
accompaniments of novelty and noise
appealed to our national love of a new
sensation, in the Third Campaign
much of the novelty will be lacking,
but the serious purpose behind the
campaign will have grown in serious
ness and importance. Our money was
needed when both the first and second
liberty loans mere floated, but it will
be more than ever needed when the
third loan is called for. Our army has
grown, our national payroll has grown
the needs of our allies have grown, the
needs of ou rallies have grown, the
necessity of for ever banishing the
unspeakable menace of Prussianism
has grown. No longer can we hope
that the entrance of this country into
the struggle will induce an early peace
More arrogant, more desperate than
ever the German government puts for
ward its impossible claims upon the
rights and life of humanity, and to ter
ritories to which they can have no
title.
"Our government in its growing
need is calling upon us to give up our ;
luxuries, is conscripting the lives of
our sons, is controlling trade. labor.
knd prices, with an ever increasing
earnestness and firmness of purpose.
"The test of our iersonal strength
of character and determination Is at
' hand. I appeal to you very earnestly
as a leader in your community to urge
upon your fellow men both before anu
: during the next liberty loan campaign
a steadfastness of purpose, an unsel
fish patriotism which shall reflect the
spirit of a man who having set his
hand to the execution of a necessary
task would rather lose that hand than
' draw it back. This is the spirit of our
' President, of our Allies it is surely
our own."

The class of moving pictures fur

agers have announced several spoken
rU.vs to come this month that are
Broadway successes with popular ar-j
lists in the cast. There is no greater
comedian upon the stage today thanj
Max Mcman. wao conies soon in a
erect farce. -Nothing But the Truth."
Three or four other shows of the

The board of supervisors of Cochise
county will meet in regular session, in
Tombstone on Monday next and be
sides auditing the usual monthly bills
will open the bids for the purchasing
of the $1.HH.000 road bonds that were
ordered issued by the election held in
the county on Dec 4. The bids will
be opened in the afternoon at two
o'clock and it is understood there are
several representatives of eastern
bond purchasers in the county making
investigation of conditions, etc., and
there is little doubt but what the
bonds will be sold at a large premium
The bonds are to draw interest not to
exceed 5 1-2 percent and are to run
for a period of twenty years and fifty
of the bonds are payable on the first
of January of each year. As each bond
is for the sura of $ 1.1K)0. 15.000 will be
paid on the first of each year com
mencing on January 1st 1919. The in
terest bearing coupons are payable on
the 1st of July and the 1st of January
each year.
The board expects to be able to sell
the bonds at a rate of interest less
than the 5 1-2 percent and that there
will also be a good sized premium of
fered. The clerk of the board has al
ready filed in his safe a number of
bids that have been sent in from out
side buyers. There is a possibility
that one of the local banks will put in
a bid for the bonds.
As soon as the bonds are sold the
county road commission will get busy
and there will be some active work
started on some permanent roads in
the county. The first of whic whill
be the paved highway from Bisbee to
Douglas. .

"THE HAN WITHOUT A
COUNTRY" IS WONDER
PHOTOPLAY OF TIME
Two thousand soldiers who were be
ing transferred from Fort Slocum to
Fort Hamilton, take part in "The Man
Without a Country." the Thanhouser
film which Jewel Productions. Inc..
brings to the Royal theatre for the
last time today. The "Sammies" are
shown at their quarters, lining up for
roll call and marching to the train w ait
ing to take them to their new station.
Lieut. Col. Maulden. commandan; of
Fort Slocum. was so interested in "The
Man Without a Country" that he gave
Director Ernest C. Warde a force of
men to help him and every assistance
in his power to make the patriotic fea
ture a success. "The Man Without a
Country" is a real picture of real army
life and shows just how sons and
brothers will look every hour of the
day after they have marched away to
do their hit. While at Fort Slocum. di
rector Warde thanked a group of of
ficers for the effective co-operation
they had given him. whereupon T. E.
Major replied: "We are glad to help
A picture like this one you are putting
on will do more good than a thousand
patriotic speeches. Motion pictures
have a wonderful influence and in this
instance no one can deny that their
influence is being exerted foi the good
of the Nation."
"IN OLD KENTUCKY"
AT ORPHEUM SOON
"How many reels in you show?"
was the question put to the manager
of "In Old Kentucky" by a typical
young American recently as he looked
at the pictures in the front of the thea
tre. -When told it was not in the pic
tures, but the play was given by real
live people, he retorted: "You can't
fool me: I'm from Missouri. How can
you have horses on the stage?" The
manager, to humor him. took him to
the back door and showed him the
real live horses and scenes hack of the
stage. The young.-ter looked up and
said: "You must be from "Old Ken
tucky' the way you showed me."
This show will be at the Orpheum

Sunday Morning, February 3, 1918.
The article in this issue of the Review from "One Who
Walks," should be read and considered and talked about
and acted upon by the property owners of this district.
Sidewalks, streets and lights are imperative needs for
the further progress and permanent prosperity of this
community. They cost money, and the property owner
must pay. it is true, but they bring returns to this same
property by increasing the value of his holdings. In a
district such as this they present knotty problems.
Neither Lowell or Warren are incorporated. But it is
impossible to conceive that the man and woman on foot
shall continue forever to walk in the streets. The flow
of traffic between the divide and the street car barns
in Warren is heavy enough to warrant serious considera
tion of this problem and great efforts and sacrifi to
overcome it. Streets, street lights and sidewalks are
fie standard emblems cf civilization. Every city must
build them: every community that pretends to be per
manent and have civic pride and an attraction for worth
while people must have them. This passing the buck
to the county or the copper companies or the city council
or the Commercial club will not get them.. The burden
rests upon the average citizen himself; upon the prop
erty owner who is afraid of taxes. With proper and
permanent improvements all property in the district will
double In value and the increase in population will be
more permanent and less of the "floater" variety. "One
Who Walks" has struck vital chord upon the Warren
district keyboard.
W. R. Stubbs. former governor of Kansas, is now a
candidate for United States senator in the Sunflower
state. This editor has the privilege to know Stubbs
more than passing well, having gone through three cam
paigns with him. and his candidacy is worthy of more
than passing telegraph notice, even to Arizona. Men
of the calibre and force and experience of this redheaded
Kansas statesman are badly needed in the United States
senate in war time. Stubbs is a big, strong man through
and through. He is of the Geddes-Xorthcliffe-Hoover-Sims
type. He DOES things. He has courage and the
instinct of initiative and skill of organization. Our
salvation in this war lies in the calling and using of
men like Stubbs to the front in legislative hall and exe
cutive department and fighting line. In time of peace
Stubbs opponents, both in and outside his party, might
well be considered as having claims for the place; but
in time of war Stubbs has instincts and training and
natural forces that place him in a class by himself in
his claims for this office. He measures up to war
standards and emergencies and a great crisis. His polite
and well meaning and ordinary opponents do not! Kerr
is the Stubbs platform, like himself, brief, strong and
straight to the point:
"Let us take no possible chance of losing. Let us
dedicate our wealth, treasure, bodies, souls and lives
to the work that is ours to do."
Spain's attitude in the Great War is not one to reflect
either glory or credit upon this ancient and almost
decadent nation. Five or six hundred years ago, in the
cars of her greatness, she, as a Catholic nation, fought
England. Germany and Holland in religious wars thSt
tovered a period of a century. But for two hundred
years past England has been her ally, her saviour and
her friend. It was the Duke of Wellington and an
English army that saved Spain from the French under
Napoleon after years of costly effort and sacrifice. And
England kept faith with Spain after the Napoleonic
dynasty fell. It-is truj that Spain and France have
gone to war many times in the past one thousand years,
but since Napoleon's time they have been friends. The
Sfianisb. people favor the allies. But in court circles of
Spain still cling that old autocracy that have dragged
Spain so low and blackened her record with so many
cruelties and fatal blunders, and these men are the sin
ister tools of German intrirue and have led Spain to
gross acts of violation of neutrality. German submarines
have coaled and provisioned in Spanish harbors, and
the allies have the absolute proofs of these things. Span
ish ships have been sunk by submarines. But Spain, of
fieially. still is pro-German. How unlike little Portugal,
also England's ally in the Napoleonic wars, who came
out bravely and devotedly against the Hunnish terror.
Sunday Morning Sermon
"Then Paul answered, what mean ye to weep
and to break mine heart? for I am ready, not
to be bound only, but also to die at Jerusalem
for the name of Jesus." Acts. 21-13.
The tears of a friend, ah. they hurt worye than all
our own suffering, sorrow and misfortune. The great
apostle had gone to Caesarea with a company of friends
to strengthen and cheer certain of the faithful there be
fore he departed for Jerusalem. And then came a certain
prophet who took Paul's girdle and bound his own hands
and feet with it and declared that the Holy Ghost haa
told him that thus should the Jews of Jerusalem bind
the owner of that girdle and deliver him to the gentiles
and to prison.
Paul heard this prophet, unmovea ana unafraid. But
the company of his friends and followers wept and "be
sought him not to go. And it was then that this stern,
strong Jew, possessed of fiery resolution, and a heart
that had carried his weak body through peril, prison
and pestilence, and a spirit that made him immune to
any fear except that of God and any emotion except
failure to preach God's word and serve well His cause,
was moved for the only time in his life of which we have
a record. "What mean ye to weep," he asked, "and break
mine heart?"
Somehow, Paul seems greater here in his weakness
than ever he was in his supreme strength against Jewish
high priest, Roman consul or the mist of death. We ad
mire him for his eloquence and scorn before the high
priests; we reverence him for his sublime faith on the
road to Rome and his high courage in the arena, but
we love him and bow before him when he confesses that
his friends tears break his lion heart
Paul the preacher, hero and martyr, is a symbol and
a creed and an ideal to be worshiped from afar. But
Paul the man. broken and undone because of the grief
of those who loved him. ah, he is one of us; we know
and 'understand this Paul, and can thrill in full and tnie
appreciation of his g res tress.
He was not a superman after all; not a demigod. J':s:
a mere mortal with a frail body and a broken heart and
a deep love for his friends, like other men. even if he
had a tongue of fire and a spirit unconquerable and a
commission direct from heaven by an angel hand.
We try to be brave and ambitious, or selfish and cruel
or unyielding and -successful in spite of all men an!
things that may hamper and hinder ns on the way to
our goal. Whether the object be worthy or unworthy,
we press on and resolve to win to the height or des
cend to the depths, cost what it may; interpose who will.
Our hearts are flint, our lips set. our purpose fixed, our
nerves steeled, and then! A friend weeps, and we" are
all undone. The rock in our breast suddenly becomes
a heart and these tears break that heart with grief, and
we turn from the goal of ambition or the pit of despair
to the rosegarden of friendship and love and there find
more happiness than can be found this side of heaven
above.
Thank God for the tears of a friend and loved one.
If we are weak they make ns strong; if we are proud
they make us Iiumble, They win soften a heart that
death and demons cannot touch. They make us so much
better than we really are. They are pearls given into
our unworthy hand. How fine it is to have a friend
that cares. How grand it is to know that some one loves
us enough to weep. Tears are more eloquent than
words and more loving than a caress. They break our
hearts, it is true, but they are balm for our soul.
Man, made in the image of his Maker, never ap
proaches so near that Maker or is so worthy of Him as
when he weeps for a friend or inspires a friend to weep
for him. But you must love if you would be loved; you
must weep if you would see tears shed for you. The
kindest, gentlest hearts are bravest and greatest in th:s
world below.
"What mean ye to weep and break mine heart?" de
manded Paul of his friends, "for I am ready, not to be
bound only, but to die." Paul's heart did not fail him
on the long desert road or in the tempest at ea or in the
prison celL It did not fail him when he facet the Jewish
mob or Agrippa. the king, or the Roman cross. It did
not fail him in danger, disease, intense suffering and
death. But this great, loving, devoted, noble heart broke
before the tears of a few fishermen and peasants gath
ered on the shores of the sea at Caesarea.
A poor man's tears and a preacher's broken heart.
Upon these is the Church of Christ founded, and surely
it will endure forever and a love that passeth all un
derstanding be its reward.

with the last blow of the pick deliv

duty to push and encourage the cotton
n-en in their efforts to unfurl white

of the mesquite. When one thinks
w?zt a pic and can of powder have

I submit that in no other city of Bis

such lack of sidewalks as Us people
have cheerfully made the be.it of

they hve r-Mliied the difiiculty o
stree't and sidewalk building of per
manent character under our topogra
phical conditions. These difficulties
have in the main been overcome by
ihe science of road b-ildiug and I be
lieve we are entitled to a change.
Even if we have nothing more than
a curV with tlie natural rook and grav

keep us out of ihe tratk of the auto

experienced in the pasl. there will aw
occasion for thanklulness. s?uch of
this wcrk as has been done in Tomb
stone Canyon has been a r.a

Let me add turther that while this
matter if providing sidewalks would
cvw4 money, and I aiu not in favor of
public expenditures upon civic improve
ments as a rule during the period of
the war. the returns from the side
walks would provide a real measure
of conservation. Sidewalks in Bis
liee's city limits aione would meaa
more than their cosi saved every year

Valley Oil fieids.
He has become chief assistant to
Dr. Edwards who is personally in
charee of the drilling operations on
the Arizona Oil Refining Company's
prrperty.
-Venture Mac" will be in charee of
the field operations tor th Arivinj '
Oi! Company, besides giving Dr. El
wards the benefit of bis years of ex-!
perience as an r il driller.
It was the Chino Valley oil tirxirri
that brought Mr. VcTrmrtt r.way
from nn o the r-ot ;os on th Pa
cific oast. He lilies oii Nicris. dotes
on them, loves them, and isn't going
to !.? lei! out of :t bitreest one yet.
"Sure. th'T's oil ir. Chino Valiey."
he a"rted confidently several days
.aco. Dr. Edwards s-iys there is and
that's good enough for me. Now you
are going to see little Mac horning in
where he can do the most pood for
hrise";f and grab off the biggest hunk
cf coin. I've fusse around Ion?
enough let several fortunes pet away
from rpe. because I was too s;cw to
grab Them, but ttis time I'm going to
sh a little speed and co:n:uon sense.
Millions are coin; to be made in Chino
Yalk-y. and one or two of them are go
ing to he mine cr I il know the reason
w hy.
!i"iore he rame to Chiao Valley he
was sales aeeut for the Venture Re
fining company. He is the man who
pushed Vent-jre gasoline to the top in
California, lief ore he went with the
Venture concern he -.as with fhe Pu
erte oil company in a similar capaci
ty, r-ei'ore that he was a driller in
dozen fields.
-How did I hsr-ea to come to Chino
Valiey r h reminisced. -Well. I had
a good job in Los Angeles, but it was
only a job. snd the life I was living
made it impossible for me to get ahead
1 knew that the time was co'Jing alone
when I ocefct to think shout niakin;
a stake. So I went to T. V.". Oakey.
general sales manager of the Ventura
eomnany. and told h:m my troubles.
- ( want to get out into some new
oil field where there's a chance for a
man of experience to get in on the
ground floor and make a few dollars
for u-.yseif. instead of for the other
fellow." I told him.
- "If you're in earnest about this.
Mac." he teplied. "go ever to Jerome.
Somewhere around tcre is a va'ley
where they're going to drill for ciL lr.
Edwards is over there, cr.d he thinks
he's going to find cil. Connect your
self with some company that he is
identified with " '
-So 1 to:.k thnt advice, and here I
am. As I passed ihrouch Jerome
Junction it s'cfc me that it would be
the finest place, in the world for an
oil fieid. Thins of it. A railroad run
ning right thro'.h the middle of the
field, ani a'! tfc"e big copper mines
only a few nr'les away.
You may ak me w hy I so so trach
on Edwards" judgment. Weil. I was
up in Tafl before anybody ever found
oil there.'' Thev were drilling up in
the hills, and finding nothing. Ed-.
wards aJvi.-'.-l tteai to go down into
the Tat. but they thoTght he was crazy
Finally to:::e dam fool did go down in
the flat, and he get a gusher that
started the Taft extitetnent.
'Edwards fc-ows oil fonr ati'in. He
has hid an almost nnctir.r'v success in
find'ng ril. and I'm goin to string
in wi'h hirn. I'm going to sticfc until
Chino Valiey is the biggest oil field in

OPINION BY JONES
OH LIABILITY GF
OFFICERS TO DRAFT
THOENIX. Ariz.. Fe'. 2 Replying
to an incuiry frrvn Wahingion regard
ing the liability of state of.'icers to
draft. Attorney General Wiley E.
Jones has transmitted the following :
opinion to Gov. Hunt:
"In answer to your ietter of recent
date, wherein yo'i state that yoa hare
an inquiry from Washington authori
ties touchins the conscription tow go
ing on. and asking what persons are
state officers, under a proper interpre
tation of the laws of Arizona. I would
state the following: ,
"While your s;atute is not so plain '
and decisive upon that subject as we
could wish. I incline to the opinion
that, in addition to all persons named
under the head of execntive officers
and civil officers, under Paragraph 49
Revised Statutes of Arizona. that
all deputies and assistants of snch of
ficers, who give their entire time to
the dnties of such office, to have regu
lar office hours fixed bv statute,
whose appointments are filled with
the secretary of state prior to en
trance on official duties, and whose
salary or compensation is paid out of
a fund raised by taxation, are state of
ficers; this of course, includes ail
judges of the supfem? and superior
courts of the stme of Ari'f.na. and the
members of the legislature of the state
"If r.eressarv in the future. I can
designs"? ly officii! title those includ
ed in the above interpretation of ottr
law" !n this connection the attornev
general calls attention to the fact
that co-mv officers whose tdnces can
lx filled by appointment if they are
drafted, are rot exempted from the
selective service art.
The lrr.preceder.ted storms' in the
rat hive paralyzed business and all
smrts of manufacturing worse than
anything the V.aier could do. The sit
uation shc.T-s how easily the whole
fphric of the ration can be torn asun
der bv a Fhoriae of fuel. It has nev
er before been brought so powerfully
to ot:r pnprecintion.
There will te no public building hill
this session of congress thus saving
about il ).('.',(.. Any new construc
tion must be based on imperative j
necessity.

The ARIZONA OIL & REFINING COMPANY is a
success because it has everlastingly kept at it. It is a
success because the company has actually started opera
tions. The Company has the finest equipment possible- It is
all naid for. It is estimated tht it cannot be duplicated .
under $20,000.
The Company has a substantia.! treasury and the next

The following geologists have reported on the Chino
V alley oil fields: Dr. E. A- Edwards. Dr. Elienne A. Rit
ter, E. Ronald Sager, Alexander Roy, L. P. Morgan.
At last comes a State Institution the Arizona Bu
reau cf Mines, connected with-the University of Arizona
at Tucson. The report of this latter institution is con
servative. It isn't boosting anybody, but it boosts the Chi
no Valle' oil fields.
Now it is only a matter of drilling and the ARIZONA
OIL & REFINING COMPANY is drilling they are not
eoing to drill but they are drillir.g and will continue to
drill.
We predict right now that on February 8 when we
take an account of stock of the actual sales made that
the entire bntance of the cacitalizaiion cf the ARIZONA
OIL & REFINING COMPANY will have been oversub
scribed we are in a position to judge we have felt the
pulse of the buying public from Maine to California
they are buying ARIZONA OIL & REFINING COM

On February 8th, Application Will Be Made to the New York Curb for Listing-
This will make a wide market for the shares. We predict an advancing market for the shares we predict a TREMENDOUS advancing market for the shares. Here is the one
argument the one point where this company is different there is no promotion sto k no pxi siock to umoaaea on me puouc wurn
tlie stock is listed. The only source if supply for the shares will be from :he stockholders themselves who own the shares who hare
bought and paid for them. The puoiic the stcc kholders in a compauy if they believe in an enterprise don"t sell on an advanoins mar
ket and an cdvancing market aiways accompanies an opeiatirg corap-my especially an oil company tia" is ac'uaiiy drilling in a proven
lield. !f there is no one to sell their shares and tin re are plenty of buyers acl buyers at t'.ie market w ill carry the stock to hi&h figures
even before oil is actually struck. x
We predict and believe we are conservative that ARIZONA OIL Ai RKK1MXG COMPANY sJiarcs will sell on the streets of PllOKNl.X

The faithful old horse that has been
hauling the Wells Fargo delivery wog
on around the streets of Pdsbe? for the

where he should be pensioned and one
of younger years be secured to t.ke
his place. He is old and feeble and
is covered with scars like a veteran
and his back is rapidly losing its hair.
He is to be pitied and it is to be hrped
that the company will see to it that
he is given a needed rest for the bal

before this have brought the matter

January Prodvction
Of Metal From Mines
In Distiict Is Large
Warren District Production Leads all Other Camps in the
State for the Month Just Past February Promises to
Yield Big. Fuel Oil Situation Is Giving Operators Some
Concern. Small Development in State Is Being Rapidly
Curtailed.
The Warren district will lead all others in Arizona in copper output for
January, making from its own ores around 15.000,004 pounds. The figure
will be close to the best in its history. From the melters at Douglas there
will probably be a record output of mm', notwithstanding some delay
early in the month. February, although a short month, now bids fair to
duplicate the high showing of January.
Digging Ore for the Soldiers. .
Except for the Clifton-Morenci district and Miami district shortage due
to delayed recovery from strike effects, and to save losses in these and
other districts by delays in transportation. January production in the state
at large would hare been around S3.000.000 pounds. As it is, it will probably
total upwards of 70.000,000 pounds. Operating forces in the different dis
tricts as now in employment measure up well in loyalty and appreciation of
the larger obligations which have come upon them through the fact that
the nation is at war. and are everywhere stretching a point in their daily
work to assist the managements to gi tJie government ail possible metal.
The requirements of the government for its own war work and that of its
allies continue to absorb the bulk of the country's total copper output. Or
ders for future delivery to private consumers are made with the proviso that
there will be delivery only in such part and at Such times as the government
directs- Present deliveries to the trade are but a small part of that which
h has asked and in greater part contracted for. That there will be any
easing in demands for copper for war uses is not indicated. The miner is
justified in feeling that for a long time to come two-thirds of every pound of
ore he digs is going direct to the aid of those fighting the world's battle
for freedom.
Supplies Shortage Is Greatest Present Danger.
More cause appears to exist at the immediate time for fear that operations
will be disturbed this year through supplies distribution than because of
labor trouble, although enemies of the country are not lacking in any one I !

Fuel Oil Administrator Looked to For Help.
The fuel oil situation gives occasion for immediate concern. It is hoped
that with the active taking over of this division by Administrator Mark
Requa of the fuel administration he will find a way to ease the present
plight of the Arizona copper producers, who as a whole have been going on
very scanty supplies from day to day. Their storage capacity is not at this
time in use to the extent of a third, and supplies on hand cover the needs
of days only. Shutting down of power and other plants because of lack of
fuel for the copper industry in the state would of course not mean the loss
of a single day's production of copper, but of a number fo days' production.
Shutting down by reason of lack of fuel involves just as much loss of Time
and money as shutting down by cause of strike. The same output of ore.
which cannot be made up, is lost and there is most of the other trouble at-
tending abrupt closing down to contend
western man and doubtless familiar with copper country conditions, which
is a fortunate fact. It may save the copper districts from experiencing the
hardships Imposed upon eastern industrial centers by fuelless days. If Mr.
Requa holds an adequate number of tank cars at the service o fthe mining
districts and keeps them moving, there will be no trouble, for there is no
shortage of oil on the coast. Che trouble has been in a shortage of tank
cars. Building of more tank cars is an urgent need before any of those now
available to Arizona territory are released ;i response to pressure for more
service In the east always provided the copper is wanted, and there does
not seem room for doubt but that it is most urgently required by the govern
ment. Government Takes Labor From Mines.
The supply of labor in the Warren district and in all other districts of the
state is at this time fairly easy. Of certain classes there is an excess. Short
age has come about among mechanical forces, however, which is yet to be
made up satisfactorily and for the making up of which the outlook is not
bright- Ship-yards calls for men at higher wages on government work than
the copper producers can possibly pay on a 23 H cent copper market are mainly

DRIFTS START SOON
RelK.rt of the superintendent of the
off the ore body as depth was gained
The ore in the bottom ot the shaft
is reported six feet wide, running up
to 6 percent copper with good values
in gold and silver, which assures smelt
ing ore with the opening up of the new
level.
According to report, the Henrietta
drift running to the north is now in
515 feet and has uncovered additional
ore. The Butternut south drift is rn
4?5 feet uncovering ore values, and
the north drift is in 356 feet. The
face in this drift is rather lean of ore
but a crosscut tunnel running west 12
feet to the foot wall has discovered
returning copper values. The walls
there are exceedingly hard and prog
ress is slow.
Or. Murray, secretary of the compa
ny, is quoted in Puluth as saying:
"We are not going, to open up the
' smelter urtil it is certain that we can
' furnish a thousand tons a day from

much to run the smelter with 300 tons
as it dos with 1.000 and to open only

TOM COWPERTHWAITE
GIVES TALK BEFORE
Y. M. G. A. MINE CLUB
i
The Mining rlub of the Y. M C. A.)
1 had an especial treat Thursday even-;
ing. Mr. t'owperthwaite explained the ;
way he had orsatmed the V. 4k A.
safety deaprtment and the principles
on which he is running it. H said
' thtat he was perfectly willing for any-
thin he had sa;d to go in the paper. ,
; and some of it follows:
i A safety inspector needs all the ;
' power he can gel. If he Is general '
I manager or superintendent he can put
; any idea he may get into force without ,
i bothering to collect data for a long I
time. The next best thing is to have'
: all the biggest bosses on committees.
: That way. things wrong can be rerae-:
I died on the minute.
J For instance, one afternoon. Mr.
iCowperthwaite found three dangerous ,
places in one afternoon. The superin- i
tendent was on the commission and 1
ordered the carpenters to go fix that I
at once. Before the shift was over j
all three holes were sale. Getting ac-.
tion that quick may have saved
three men's lives or prevented bad ac-1
cidents. That kind of safety first gets '
results. I
Mine committees, in his scheme, are '
made ip of bosses. He is not willing
to put miners on the committee, for j
fear a boss might get "down"" on some ,
fellow who suggests a safety plan the '
boss does not care for. And besides. '
if the bosses are on safety commit
tees the prevention ot accidents be-
comes part of their regular business, I
In 191S only two bosses had a clear i
record on accidents: this year 14 have. '
The first half of 1917. ot course, was :
tar safer than the second, but the ;
whole year 191? had not so many ac- '
cidents as 191$. partly because the .
men have not been rushed so much. '
hit largely on account of the safety ,
organization. v !
Most accidents occur about 11 or 1 '
p. m. A poor boss will insist on tell-
ing only one thing at a time, and hav- (
ing that done before he gives away
his next move. That means that the;
miner has time to burn until about j
li o'clock, when the shifter tells htm
hat to do. He kills time, moving.
lagging around. Then, when it's near-,
ly time to shoot he has to rush like
fury to get anything like ready. Vnless
the miner is cooler and more far-
seeing thin the shifter he will be 1
bound to pull a bonehead and knock !
a rock the wrong way. upset his ma- i
chine or do something else to get hurt.
It makes thincs worse for the shifter.
to bawl him out. i
A man who is bossing ought to be
an artist in handling men. If he is
crabbed or hot-headed it's almost ira- j
possible for him to make good as any- 1
thing but a rawhider. A good shifter !
gets things done and demands a fair ;
day's work of a man. but takes it for '
granted that the fellow will either do j
it or ieave. It's poor taste tor any .
boss to fire a man on account of some j
grudge. If he does people can tell j
that the boss tudment on other ;
things is apt to be just as poor. The
good old gulden rule is about the b sr j
instruction a shifter can get as to the i
way to get along. If a shifter likes to
be bawled out himself, he should do it '
to the men under him: otherwise, not. i
The safety record of each shift boss ;
in the C. & A. mines Is kept and
checked up . A prize of $t0o was giv- J
en last year for the best record, but
that is not a permanent policy. Any-'
way. a shifter hates to have his record ;
beaten. The man who wins talks tj
his men. knows how they do things '
and prevents many unsafe practices, j
He knows tt if some fellow has been
carrying powder around in his pock- J
ets. mixed up with fuses and caps, j
and dangerously near the flame of his '
miner's lamp. One man whose record j
was- very low said that naturally an
other would have a clean safety rec
ord. "Why. he goes around crying tor .
it." That kind gets it. And a fellow
who rawhides his men loses out on
the amount produced as well, because,
he has to break in too many green
hands. That makes more work for the l
older men and increases their acci
dent rate at the same time. j
New men naturally are hurt oftener
than old. The danger point is about i
six months, when a new man think
he knows far more about the job than '
his boss. Married men have less
long layoffs than single, and foreign
ers who cannot speak English give aj
large accident rate. The C. A. is
now employing 90 per cent Amert-,
cans.
Records are kept in all manner of
ways. The number, as well as the oer-!
rentage, is recorded in the safety t
data. A foreman will wilt into his
seat when the safety man remarks.!
"Ton have had nine serious accidents
during the last six months."
Of direct causes f accidents, those
that the company could have prevent
ed are about 2 per cent. Carelessness
of the man Injured or of fellow-workmen
and trade risks account for the
rest. The company Is perfectly will
ing to pit its record against others.
The lecture was one of the most
enjoyable In the series. It appealed
especially to the old -experienced min
ers, who knew what he was talking
about and are not pleased when a
mucker starts warming up caps with
s safety lamp, or wten some one mis
takes a fuse in a missed hole for a
mesquite root and sets fire to it.
The laving off of men who break
safety rules Is unpopular, but prevents
accidents. One fellow who was laid
off for three days told Cowrerthwaite

OLD SILVER KING IS
EXPECTED TO REOPEN
RICH LOWER LEVELS
SUPERIOR. Arix.. The Superior
Sun says:
Ileveiopments at the Silver King
during the past few meek have great
ly strengthened The Sun's belief that
the old premier silver producer wil!
early be numbered among the big ship
pers of the Superior district and that
during the next few years the value of
its output will exceed the total value
of all mineral extracted during the en
tire life of the famous property.
Old-timers who were on the ground
during the palmy davs of Silver King
have persistently held that god val
ues would be found at the 250 foot
level, and that between the 250 ami
the 450 foot levels large bodies of com
paratively high grade silver ore would
be encountered. Influenced by the
statements of these pioneer miners,
the management has explored that 250
toot level and the statements of the
old-timers have been verified to a very
satisfactory degree. I this level
some exceedingly rich gray copper and
silver ore has been opened, which com
pares very favorably with similar ore
found on the estate of the Magma Cop
per company.
The management has now decided
to unwater the shaft below the 450
foot level and explore the 2'0 feet of
ground between the -50 and 450 foot
levels. It is claim-si that in sinking
the shaft in early days large hoiies ot
comparatively rich silver ore mere en
countered below the 50 foot level but
that the ore below the 450 foot level
was so much richer that the 2H) feet
above the 450 foot level was only
a very heavy tonnage of good milling
scratched. It is believed that there is
ore in the unexplored territory in
fact with modern treatment plants
values far in excess of those found in
the early days will be taken from the
mine in the workings above the 450
foot level.
During the past tew weeks experi
mental runs of the mill have been
mad. It has been discovered that a
number of chajiges to the plant will
have t be made which will require
from to 40 days. New riipuent
has been otdered for the mill and It
mill be installed as soon as it arrives
and the mill will then be started.
There U a very heavy tonnage of mill
ing ore on the dump, and with th.-x
mined at the 250 foot level there will
be amole ore for the mill until output
ting is started from the tone between
the 250 and 450 foot levels.

On both the front and rear of each

while blue lights mill show on the
semaphores when the tracks are

something is wrong and will stop

save considerable time, as it has
been necessary in the past to sent
brakemen ahead of trains to prevent

The installation cf the system ill
greatly facilitate handling of ore
trains throughout the mine and win
expiate danger to a minimum, as it t
one of the most practical safety first
systems in operation.
A swinging arm containing a big

Another recent but enthusiastic
member of the Y. M. C- A. has been
lost to us. Amos McLennon has taken
unto himself a wife, and as always is
the case after such an event we hav
little hope or seeing his smiling face
around the building. Newlyweds al
ways believe in keeping to themselves.
R P. Hale of the store department
of the Copper Queen and incidentally
one of the favorite piano players and
a royal entertainer, has been very
much indisposed the last week, due to
a case of the grippe.
The new bookshelf in the library
table fills a long-felt want. The con
venience of a good book makes the
reading so much easier. The sermons
of Billy Sunday seem to be taking
first place just now.
At tonight's session or the Travel

ture, entitled "With Pershing Out of
Mexico." He saw and photographed
the famous withdrawal.

put off doing what you know you need
and can easily get?
Mr. Cowperthwaite's "Safety First"
lecture caused a sensation among
those who heard it. He was pretty
hard on a poor shift boss, but judging
by the expression of pleased amuse
ment on the faces of those present
they were the good kind. Next week
Mr. Dosher is scheduled to dissect a
