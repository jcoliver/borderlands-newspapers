UNDATED WAR LEAD (By the As
sociated Press). Whether as a result
of weariness after two weeks or In
cessant fighting or because of the
greatly increased strength in man
power and positions of the enemy
forces on the Soissons-Rheims front
have notably decreased their efforts
to clear the salient.
If the pause in the offensive is at
tributed to weariness, the armies of
the German crown prince also must
be worn out for despite reinforcements,
thev have lacked the hardiness to
throw back their antagonists.
The fourteenth day of the great al
lied offensive saw little activity on the
part of either of the contending forces
J except in the nature of reciprocal
bombardments.
Tuesday night witnessed violent at
tempts by the Germans to expel the
Americans and French from the valu
able positions they hold north of the
Ourcq in the region of Fere En Tarde
ncis, and along the western side of the
salinet near Oulchy Le Chateau. where
Scottish troops are holding with the
French the wedge that has been driven
eastward into the enemy line. These
efforts were entirely fruitless. A
watchful eye is being kept by the Ger
mans on the Americans standing at ue
apex of the battle line near Fere En
Tardenois, and the enemy guns are
showering their positions with great
quantities of high explosives and gas
shells. The enemy also continues
jealously to guard with huge effectives
the extreme eastern and western flank
of the salient to ward off possible
surprise attacks.
The latest Berlin official communi
cation asserts that more than 4000
prisoners have been taken by the Ger
mans in the last few days and that
since July 15 in excess of 24.000 allied
troops have been captured.
Whether the Germans have chosen
the spot where ultimately they will
face about and give battle to the allied
forces is not apparent. Great fires be
hind the lines, possibly might indicate
the destruction of further villages
which it is intended to evacuate and
press on northward to a chosen battle
line.
With the approach of the commence
ment of the fifth year of the war, the
German emperor evidently realizes the
seriousness o the situation. In a proc
lamation to his army and navy he tells
his men they are facing the hardest
struggle of the war but they will be
able to foil "the desperate efforts of
the enemy."
What may result in aggravating the
already serious situation between the
Germans and the Ukrainians is the as
sassination of Field Marshal von Ech
horn, the German dictator in the Uk
raine, and his adjutant. They were
billed by the explosion of the bomb
thrown by a native In Kiev.
GERMAN OFFICIAL
BERLIN, via London, July 31. Ger
man troops in the fighting of the last
few days took more than 4000 prison

their captures to more than 24.000

today. Altogether twenty skeletons
were found. Some of the older Mari

WAR EXPENSE

(By Review Leased Wire)
WASHINGTON, July 31. War ex
penses for July were somewhat less
than for June and May, amounting to
about $1,482.01)0,000, as compared
with $1,512,000,000, the record for
June, and $1.50S,000.000 for May, the
treasury department tonight an
nounced. The outlay for July, how
ever, was approximately the amount i
estimated in advance by the treasury
and expenses for August probably will
be higher, it was said.
During July the government's daily
outlay was about $4S, 000,000. An aver
age of $38,000,000 daily, was for ordin
ary expenses of the army, navy, ship
ping board and other agencies and
$10,000,000 daily in loans to the allies.
Total ordinary expenditures for the
month were about $1,157,000,000 and
loans to allies $325,000,000.
Receipts from sale of war saving
stamps today passed the half billion
dollar mark, of which $200,000,000
came in this month.

(By Review" leased Vlre
WASHINGTON. July 31. An odd
calm fell ever the Aisne-Marne battle
area today with only tne thunder cf
the guns to tell of new and more ter
rible gusts of the war storm to come.
Paris and Beriin both noted It. The
infantry had paused for breath while
the artillery pounded new roads of ad
vance for General Foch's victorious
armies.
Just what the luli may prove waa
not apparent. Possibly the enemy is
already on the move after the decisive
defeat he met in the battle which be
gan Saturday and centered on the
American positions along the north
bank of the Ourcq. Here the Amer
ican third division and the now famou
Forty-second division, the Rainbow di
vision, composed of former national
guardsmen of many states, have made
good their positions against the en
emy's best fighting unit3. They have
met. outfought and forced backward
by their fierce ardor picked Prussian
and Bavarian divisions brought fresh
lc the field with orders to hold the
line of the Ourcq at all costs.
That line ha3 been broken. The
American spearhead, driven forward
again, finally broke the fighting edge
ot the enemy defense. When support
ing columns surged forward across the
Ourcq to consolidate the ground so va
liantly won and held by the first rush,
enemy hopes of clinging to the present
line dwindled. Holding the apex of ths
allied line at the center, the Amer
icans had paved the way for the dash
ing capture of Chalmont Butte to t;e
westward by the Franco-British forces.
Allied guns now dominate the enemy's
lines from this height foretelling new
inroads to his positions and the strong
probability that he will be compelled
to fall back to the Vesle line.
The victory was given new signifi
cance by General March, who told the
newspaper men at his mid-week con
ference, that each army now was bent
on the destruction of the other: all
lessed strategic objectives having been
Bwept away on both sides.
The mission of each is to kill; to de
stroy the fighting power of the other.
It is the ultimate military objective
that both are seeking and there cai;
be no halting short of the goal.
As General March never before has
talked at these conferences In general
terms, when he turned today fruiti the
pin-dotted map where the turn ana
sway of the battle was outlined in
detail, and for the first time disclosed
the true significance of the struggle
in the narrow confines, his words car
ried conviction on his hearers.
"Whatever the enemy's objective
was at the start of the drive," he said,
picking his words carefully, "and what
ever our hope was In the counter of
fensive on the flank of this salient,
it is now perfectly evident that these
aims have been set aside.
"The objective of each army is tha
other army; each one of them wants
to kill as many of the others as pos
sible. "The holding back of the jaws (of
the salient) by the Germans at Sois
son3 and near Rheims has made it
practically impossible for us to expect
a bag. They have had two weeks now
to withdraw from the dangerous points
down near the Marne, and the objec
tive of each army is the other army."
The chief of staff had prefaced this
new conception of the great struggle
With a careful outline of the battle
positions, showing that since last Sat
urday another ten miles had been cut
out of the length of the battle line by
allied successes. It Is now barely fifty
four miles around the flattened salient
in which the enemy has massed al
most a million men as against seventy
fonr miles when the counter assault
was set in motion. From Chateau
Thierry the Americans have made tne
maximum advance, covering fourteen
miles to reach the positions where
they rested today, preparing for new
advances.
Coming to the army being trained
here to support the men at the front
General March said he had ordered
six new divisions created. Again
regular regiments will be used as the
center on whic h each division is built.
The chief of staff made Jt plain that
It Is a monthly program of increase
upon which the war department has

of seventy-five cents a day with ma

Davies, federal labor mediator, were
accepted at a mass meeting and smel

trict held here tonight and a threaten
ed strike was averted. The original
demand of the men was for a wage in
crease of $1.10 a day.
JEROME, Ariz., July 31. Danger of
a strike of mine and smelter workers
in the Verde copper district was past
tonight in the opinion of labor leaders
and representatives of employers. The
change in sentiment, it was said, be
came apparent after Hywell Davies,
federal labor mediator had offered a
fiat increase of 75 cents a day in
wages and also had agreed to order
a material reduction in the rent of
houses and in water and light rates.
A telpprnm frnm William R Wilsnn
secretary nf labor, annealing to the
men to do nothing that that would in
terfere with the production of copper
which was received today, was also
said to have apparently had much
effect.
Orders for a striki to begin at 3:30
o'clock this afternoon were rescinded
by the Clarkdale and Verde smelter
companies. The Jerome committee.
which had been in conference all day
at Clarkdale with Mr. Davies, did not
return here until after the hour the
night shift had reported for duty.
DETAILS OF ADJUSTMENT
Word was received in the city last
evenins of crder by Federal Adminis
trator Davies for an- advance of 75
cents a day in wages in the Jerome
district as compared with wages prior
to July 1. This brings the Jerome
wage to $5.90 the day 5 cents higher
than Bisbee. Much more than offset

district and which does not obtain In
the Jerome camp.
When, upon advice of the federal
mediator, an advance cf 50 cents the
day in wages was made by copper
producers in the state early in the
month, following the advance in the
price of copper, Jerome mines an
nounced that inasmuch as there "as
some quesliou about a 50 cent advance
being enough for that camp they
would await an investigation and rul

that he would Investigate all local con

conforming with his findings. His de
cision of yesterday was the result. In
tendering It, Judge Davies in effect
ruled that the advance of 25 cents
over the flat advance of 50 cents maue
in other parts of the state was deemed
just because of local conditions In

part a compromise between a bonus
plan offered by the companied in con
nection with their willingness to make
advance of 50 cents or any other figure
the federal administrator might pro
nounce. The bonus plan offered was
the same as is in effect in the Warren
district and means something more
than 25 cents the day extra pay fcr
men who continue in employment a
year or more. The Verde district men
expressed preference for the advance
on a fixed basis payable daily, which
the 25 cents over the advance in other
districts in the state represents.
In making acceptance of the order
of the federal administrator the Verde
district companies yesterday arc un
derstood to have accompanied their
acquiesence with formal pretest, the
latter filed as have been other pro
tests made by operators since the ex
ercise of government control, the lat
ter in effect if not in stipulated terms.
The protests merely serve to continue
the attitude cf the companies as as
serting their rights to the continuance
of private control and- are understood
to be only for the formal purpose ol
making record for reference and ad
justments in the event of government
steps such as have been taken with
reference to the railroads, telegraph
and telephone lines.
Expressions here and as learned
from other coppei" districts in the
state last night indicated satisfaction
with the Jeroine decision, accompanied
by belief that justice had been done
and that it had been accomplished in
a way fiat protected other districts
from any feeling of discrimination or
from eause for dissatisfaction. Infor
mation from Jerome was that the larg
majority of the men there received the
news cf the 75 cent advance with
much favor, the greater number not
having had sympathy with demands
for the dollar advance and few hav
ing believed that the government's ad
ministrator would authorize more fian
the 50 cent advance made in ot'ier
parts of the state.

COMPLIMENTS AMERICANS
(By Review leased Wire)
LONDON, Aug. 1 "Nobody can con
template without profound admiration
the vigor and heroism with which
the Americans have fought in every
stage of the battle," writes the Daily
Mail correspondent with the American
army on the front in France.
"Ir bravery were the only test for
winning bur affections, then the Amer
icans merit the highest possible es
teem. But it is not bravery alone that
has given the Americans during the
last ten days their repeated successes.
Fiercely as they fight, they neverthe
less right intelligently and profitably.
"There are units which have had
much more experience in battle than
ethers, but when the battalions which
have manned quiet sectors are thrown
into the furnace they fight as well as
their more experienced comrades.
There is one unit, which, since the
German offensive began, has won mi
dying renown, fighting at one of the
most important points on the line, al
though it had previously experienced
only trench raids and gas attacks.
Such an achievement gives a vivid in
dication of the fighting value of tho
Americans."

headed toward the border. ,

BY REVIEW
.NEW YORK. July 31. The stock
market's lukewarm response today to
the record breaking statement of the
I'nited States steel corporation, issued
after the close of yesterday's session,
was considered striking proof of the
utter lack, of public interest In se
curities.
Steel eclipsed all other issues, furn
ishing abut 50 per cent of the day's
moderate dealings.
The stock recorded an extreme ad
vance of I'm points, retaining little
more than half its gain.
.Affiliuted equipments rose 1 to 6
points, oils 1'4 to 3 and gas shares
added 2 to 3'4 points to the previous
day's gains. '
There were desultory advances of 1
to 4 points in Distillers Industrial
Alcohol, Sugars, Malting preferred, In
ternotional paper 'and Burns brothers
coal.
American telephone rallied on re
laxation of recent pressure, but West
ern Union declined another fraction.
Rails and other standard stocks were
listless and inclined to ease. Sales
amounted to 300,000 shares.
Bonds were firm, liberty issues stif
fening after early heaviness in the
4'4's. Total sales (par value) were
J5,S25,000.
Old United States bonds were un
changed on ca!ls registered 2's gam

GRAIN
CHICAGO, tluly 31. Month end
profit taking by longs more than
wiped out in the corn ma'rket today
an advance due largely to rapid fall
ing off in arrivals at leading primary
markets. The close was weak ',i to
Tc net lower, with August II. 537 to
J1.54 and September $1.54" to $1.55.
Oats finished '& cent off to 2lic up.
In provisions the outcome ranged from
20 cents decline to 65 cents advance.
Heavy selling forced a sharp break
in corn prices during the last hour.
Relative lightness of receipts with
prospects of further decrease In the
movement from the country had much
to do with shaping the temporary up
ward course of values. A bullish flur
ry in July oats resulted from belated
covering by shorts. August and Sep
tember oats weakened with corn.
Nearly all deliveries of provisions re
flected the strength of the hog market.

The Army Y. M. C. A. j
In these days of war an institution stand
ing head and shoulders above the rest in the
actual service is rendering to the soldiers
in the training camp and in the field is the
Young Men's Christian association. Or
ganized hastily but effectively tq meet the
enlarged demand for its services it occupies
a niche hard to be filled by any other insti
tution or aggregation.
At the beginning, the Y made mistakes
as any other body of men must, when called
upon very suddenly to undertake a vast
new effort. However, the men at the head
of the movement had brains, tact, the de
sire to sacrifice self unselfishly upon the
altar of country, and above all else, the con
suming desire to get in close daily contact
with the men in training for war to give
them the best advantages surrounding con
ditions would allow. With such men at the
head of the Y movement, the problems
offered, while difficult, were as certain of
solution as the night follows the day.
Gradually there was an assembling of
men of high attainments in the pulpit, the
school room, from all walks of business and
specialists in athletics. Unavoidably there
were some "square pegs" among them who
failed to fit the niches of usefulness they
had been chosen to occupy. Kindly but
with rapidity, these men were shifted out of
the scenario and new men, more capable
of bearing their share of the burden, with
a broader understanding of humanity, re
placed them. With might and main these
men work for the betterment of the embryo
soldiers, striving to make them better
men morally, mentally and physically.
Earnest effort to cooperate with the
army in every field of activity where
cooperation is possible is evident at all
times. The army at first was suspicious of
the Y but this feeling has been replaced by
one of friendship for the institution and its
workers. We use the word workers ad
visedly for there is no opportunity for a
drone to hang onto the skirts of the Y in
the army. He simply does not fit in with
the scheme of things and is dropped.
No one must get the idea that the Y. M.
C. A. men in the training camps are satis
fied to be there. They, like the men of the
army, show a disposition to feel that the
period in the training camp is but a proba
tionary one which necessarily must be en
dured before they can hope to "go across
to do all in 'their power to make the men
actually fighting as happy and comfortable
as lies within their power.
Exultation and exaltation are the emo
tions exhibited by a Y. M. C. A. worker no
less than by the soldier, when told he may
go overseas to get in the thick of things.
But in his heart of hearts each man in the
Y uniform knows he is serving when he
works in the training camps, even as the
soldier knows he is serving while in train
ing. Each has given up his daily avocation,
his home hopes and opportunities, to serve
his nation in his peculiar way.
And do not get the idea that the Y man
is a slacker in any sense of the term. Al
most without exception it will be found that
in some way these workers do not come up
to the army standard and so cannot enlist
or be drafted for service in the front line,
or tHey are men of more or less mature
years who yet preserve a great part of their
physical vigor but who, on account of their
a?e, would not be accepted. We person
ally have known men in the Y service who
tried again and again to get into the army
itself and without success.
To the man who has been accustomed
to observe the tactics of denominations in
civil life, each claiming to represent the true
religion and in many instances decrying all
others, there is r. peculiar beauty in the
workings of the Y. M. C. A. under war
conditions. Such a thing as sectarianism is
not rr-cosnied. Mn of all prote.-tant faiths
work together. The Baptist, the Methodist,
the Presbyterian all preach a common gos
pel of the love of Jesus Christ. They spend
not too great a part of their time in preach
ing, rather depending upon the example of
a Christian life, lived before the soldiers,
and a wholesome routine of amusements
to influence them in the path of righteous
ness. In a no less marked manner are other
institutions doing fine work in the training
camps and in the field. The Knights of
Columbus, representing Catholicism; the
Christian Scientists, the Jewish Board for
War Welfare Work, all may be numbered
among the elements working toward a com
mon end the betterment of the soldiers.
To the man accustomed to the everyday
things of life, who has become inured to
the idea that each religious sect or denom
ination isa thing separate and apart from
every other one, it comes as a surprise,
though a pleasant one, to see protestant and
Catholic, Jew and gentile working together,
holding meetings in one another '3 assembly
halls, trying to interest and amuse thous
ands of young men, who, severed from
home influences might drift into lives of
dissipation were these good influences
lacking.
The Y is doing the greatest volume of
work only because it has more buildings
and more workers than the others. The
workers of all these institutions, cooperat
ing with army chaplains, the ministerial
association of the nearest town to the camp
or cantonment, with the war camp com
munity boards and with good people gener
ally are trying to make such conditions that
our boys after the war will return to the
nation stronger in every respect than when
they left, better fitted to become the fathers
of the next generation and to impart to
their children and their children's children
the strength of body and character they
have attained in the war for liberty for
mankind.
GIVE THEM HELL
In whatever words the though was ex
pressed in pre-historic times, when the
vocabulary of man was limited, it is more
than likely our ancestors had arrived at a
verbal means of making known the give-them-hell
idea before they had traveled far
on the road to civilization.
The chronicle of the world has more to do
with fighting fighting between tribes, be
tween countries, between nations than it
has with anything else. The battles re
counted in the old testament are not the
least interesting reading in the book. ' The
battles of history is the literature with the
greatest appeal to a boy in his first search
for knowledge.
There is something in the three words
"Give them hell" that expresses the spirit
of battle better than any other phrase that
has yet been invented.
No doubt that the commanders in the
world's first battle used the term in spur
ring their men to victory. No doubt Leon
idas used it to cheer his 300 steadfast
Spartans at the battle of Thermopylae. No
doubt Hannibal used it, and Caesar, our
own Captain Travis at the seige of the
Alamo and Joe Wheeler in the Civil war
and the war with Spain.
No man read the bulletins from the fight
ing front yesterday, telling of the slashing
blows being administered to the German
crown prince's army, who did not feel in
clined to say: "Give them hell," and a great
number of men did say it.
From now on there will be a growing
temptation to use the expression as news
comes from time to time that the allies have
the enemy on the run.
It was just nine years ago this week that
George Bleriot, the French aviator, made
the first flight across the English channel
in his new monoplane. The world gasped
in wonder over the unparalleled event.
Little did any one dream on that summer
morning of 1909 that when this portly
sandy moustached Frenchman climbed
down from his machine upon the chalk
cliffs of Dover, that he marked the begin
ning of an epoch. How could he know that
thousands of English battle planes would,
in a few years, cross the channel to come
to the aid of la Belle France? And yet,
on that morning, Bleriot spoke of the ter
rible possibilities for war and destruction
that lay in the airplane. But he had no
vision of a Frenchman who was to destroy
fifteen German planes in fifteen days, as
Lieut. Coeffard did during the recent series
of battles in Picardy.
Another report lifts been made that the
Germans are dropping poisoned candy over
Paris. Apparently they have discovered
there are still some childhen left there.

DOCGLAS, July 31. Right ca the
heels of .a report that Gen. P. Klias
Calles, who for nearly a year has been
military governor c( Sonora while he
was prosecuted his campaign agairst
the Yarquis. and C. G. Soriano, acting
governor during this period, have had
a qi urret over the beer ouesl.oa as a
result of which Calles removed Sori
ano frcm office, Mr. Soriano himse'J
arrived here this morning. H's home
is in Agua Prieta and he has consid
erable property interests in Douglas.
He is accompanied by his brother in
law, Ives G. Lelevier, former Mexican
consul here. Both will leave on Fri
day for Ocean Park to join their fam
ilies and remain with thein until Sep- j
tember. Soriano admits he .has had
a disagreement with Calles. In fact,
he ha3 brought with him copies of a
proclamation to the people of Sonora
which he had printed in Hermosillo,
July 19, in which he explains his side
of the controversy in detail. The gist
of his appeal is that Calles and the
army are usurping the powers of the
civil officers of the state and that
Calles is becoming a dictator.
Believes in Beer
Also he admits he is not a prohi
bitionist. "1 believe in the use of beer and
wines at the table," he said here this
morning. "You cannot abolish a cus
tcm centuries old with a decree. 1
don't believe General Calles will shut
off thes ale of beer in Hermosillo and
Guaymas at least until fall. It is so
hot down there now, day and night,
that one must drink large quantities
of liquids of some kind. The water is
not gocd and upsets the stomach
when taken in large quantities. Beer
is much preferable."
In his proclamation Mr. Soriano
goes on to say that the military
authorities at Caiianea confiscated ten
cases of alcohol which Soriano had
permitted for the use of the American
drug store at Cananea, which scld it
to the mining companies of the district
fcr medicinal use and making fluid ex
tract. This drug store, it might be
explained, is operated by J. P. Fer
guson, the Douglas druggist. That
was the beginning of the trouble be
tween the civil and military. author
ities of the state.
The military authorities. Mr. Sori
ana asserts in his proclamation, have
claimed the right of search of any
house or business establishment they
might wish to enter, which, of course,
is denied them under the constitution
of Mexico, and have gone ahead and
exercised it in several cases. After
(Jalles had formally authorized his
officers to make such searches and
arrests, Mr. Soriana says, he issued
an order to the mayors of all cities
in Sonora tnat the law and the consti
tution was a higher authority than the
military governor of the state and that
they should abide by the law.
Three days ago Governor Soriano
made an address in the plaza at Her
mosillo to the people of the city, ex
plaining the differences that had
arisen between him and General
Calles. After he had spoken for forty
minutes, two generals, Arnulfo Gomeb.
who is well known in Douglas, and
Torres, who is now in charge of the
campaign against the Yaquis. walked
up to the speaker's stand, pistol in
hand, and, backed by twenty-five other
army officers, also armed, threatened
Soriano, and demanded that he cease
speaking.
Chief to the Rescue
Then Polaco. chief of police, pulled
his gun aud threatened to shoot the
tir.st officer ho laid his hand on So
riano. The clash which was impend
ing was Drevented when a woman in
the audience grasped Soriano's coat
tail and rushed him out of the crowd.
At the hotel another woman, a mem
ber of an influential family, stepped
up to the proprietor and told him to
charge all expenses of the governor
at the hotel to her. This incident, say
Soriano's friends, shows what a strong
following he has iu Sonora. especially
among tne tames, wno are

DO NOT BELIEVE IT.
A lyuotype operator went to tne

he had stolen some green corn from
his grocer, and that, when he got re
ligion, his conscience hurt him until he
had to send on the money. One of our
Ivnotype men scoffed when he read the
Item. He said that a mixture of re
Iigicn and green corn might give one
of his trade a headache or a stomach
ache, but that it could not make his
conscience ache, because that is an
unknown quantity.

GENERAL JOHNSTON IS

BOYS COMPOSING PERSONNEL OP
34TH DIVISION STRUCK BY PER
SONALITY OF THEIR COMMAND
1NG OFFICER WHO SETS GOOD
EXAMPLE TO THEM
The more the men see the com
ma.ider of the :;4lh division the better
they like him. He inspires confidence
and respect and gives evidence of a
smcerelv of pi.rpose that adds to the
volume of patriotism, says Trench and
Camp.
At a monger mass meeting of the
casual camp held at the stodium Fri
day night. General Johnston informed
the n;"n that he obeyed the rules of
health as laid down by the medical
department of the army, and asked
every i-'oii who would do likewise to
rise to his feet. Net a man remained
seated.
During the progress of his patriotic
address he offered the timely sugges
tion that as the Lufitaniu was the
first big shin sunk by the Huns that
an appropriate slogan for the 34th
division would be "Kemember tne
I.usitania." Cheer upon cheer greeted
this suggestion, the idea being adopt
ed with a vim and enthusiasm that
bodes ill to the hounds of Hunlnnd
when the 3ith division gets a swipe
at them.
The brief address given by General
Johnston at the casual camp competi
tive dri:l Friday afternoon added an
other v.;realh to the commander's
friendship banquet.

CAPT. SAMUEL BROWN, BROTHER
OF R. BROWN OF THIS CITY,
MAKES IMPORTANT DISCOVERY
IN DEVELOPING OF X-RAY PIC
TURESWAS RESIDENT HERE
According io a copy of the Cincin
nati Times-Star, that was received in
this city a few days ago, Capt. Sam
uel Urown. a brother of R. Hrown, of
the Miners' Store of this cily, has
made some important developments in
the taking of pictures by X-ray. Dr.
Brown was employed at the Copper
Queen hospital a number of years ago
as an interne and left here to go east
to take a course. That he has made
good is evident from the following
which is taken from te above paper..
"CAMP SHKKMAN Chillicothe, O.,
July 10. The base hospital at this
cantonment was today the center of
attraction for medical men throughout
the country. As a result of the an
nouncement that Capt. Samuel Brown,
of New York city, who is stationed
here, has discovered a new plasic
photograph in X-ray work, physiciaiis
everywhere will undoubtedly hear of
Camp Sherman. Captain Brown spent
five years in the Cornell university
laboratory in reasearch work. The new
photograph is made by combining posi
tive and negative plates. Since the
establishment of the department at the
base hospital. Captain Brown and his
assistants have taken 4911 X-ray photo
giaphs of soldiers' injuries."
NEED MORE TROOPS
(Tiy Review Leased Vv'ire)
PARIS, July 31. In well informed
Rumanian circles it is said the Ger
man high command has asked the
commander of the German troops sta
tioned in Rumania and in the Russian
districts how many divisions can be
released for the western front.
Field Marshal von Mackensen in
Rumania, recording to a dispatch to
the Havas Agency from Berne, replied
that it would be lmsafe to remove any
troens, owing to the excited condition
j of the Russian population. The dis
patch adds that Von Mackensen nas
! directed the Rumanian government to
; proclaim a state of siege.

TQ MAKE ONE MORE
ASX FORBIDS
PRESENT LAW ALMOST IMPOS
SIBLE TO WORK UNDER COSTS
GONE TO SUCH EXTENT DOUBT
IS EXPRESSED AS TO COMPLE
TION OF HIGHWAY AT PRESENT
The Cochise county highway com
mission was in session Monday and
for nearly Ihree hours thrashed out
the problem of whether Cochise coun
ty will get any roads built under the
million dollar bond issue now, or not
until after the war.
After a thorough investigation of
the all-absorbing topic, and with lega;
advice on the every angle of a mos
cumbersome road law that is surround
ed by red tape, so as to make it easi
ly to operate under, the commission
finally decided to try once more, and
consequently set September 14 as the
final show down for the matter.
Up to the present time the commis
sion has been seriously handicapped
by the lack of funds, and even at this
time only half of the bonds are sol !.
but the work that has been done cov
ers organization of the commission
and surveying, and continuous efforts
to let contracts for the Bisbee-Dcug'.a
garding and draining, and so far only
the grading of section three, from
Douglas to Forrest, has been let.
The delay of selling, or getting buy
ers for the bonds from November un
til March seriously handicapped the
commission In getting bids which
might have saved thousands of dollars,
but red tape, and lack of money, are
alone responsible for that condition.
On September 14 the commission
will call for bids for the paving of the
road from Bisbee to Douglas, and the
grading of sections one and two. and
the draining of the entire distance
They will also call for bids on section
one of the Tombstone-Benson road,
which is from Tombstane to CurtU
Flat.
The commission, in addition to work
done up to the present, has also let the
contract for widening the paving he
tween Risbee and Lowell, through
Johnson addition, which is now being
done. If the grading contract is let
far the Bisbee-Douglas stretch. th.
paving on it will not be done until
it Is
on Draught
