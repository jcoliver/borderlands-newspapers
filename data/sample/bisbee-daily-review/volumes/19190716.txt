, WASHINGTON, July 15 Ex
emption from military service of
Edsel Ford, son of the Detroit
automobile manufacturer, was
the subject of an attack in the
senate today by Senator Sherman,
Republican, Illinois, who said
young Ford was "a presidential
pet," and had been saved from
serving in the army by an abuse
of executive power.
The Illinois senator asserted
that as a member of the commit
tee considering the Ford-Newberry
senatorial contest, he had ask
ed Secretary Baker for a copy of
the proceedings in the Ford ex
emption proceedings, but that the
request had been denied on the
ground that the hearings wrre not
a public r'trrC. ' V- -
Mr. Sherman said he desired to
establish that Henry Ford had
been defeated In the senatorial t
election because of the "con-'
tempt" of the people of Michi
gan over his son's exemption.
MOUNT CLEMENS. Mich., July 15.
A great change has come over Henry
Ford's view of International relations
since he blossomed out as a pacifist :
propagandist in 1915, for now, accord-1
ing to his testimony in his $1,000,000
libel suit against the Chicago Daily
without delay if the present plans for j
a League of Nations fails.
The Henry Ford, who in 1916, was
opposing the sending of the National
Guard to the Mexican border and urg
ing the United States to take the lead
in disarmament, asserted today that
he is now for "preparedness to the
hilt," If it appears that this new war is
is necessary. He took the position as
a witness, that now is the time to es
tablish universal peace, and that if the
great war which ceased In the field
last November does not result in a
league which will assure that peace,
there can be no better time than the
present to renew the strife.
According to Mr. Ford, most of the
pacifist propaganda distrubted broad
cast in his name .was written by Theo
dore Delavigne, a publicity agent, em
ployed by him to educate the public,
os he put it, as to the waste and horror
of war and to Its Heedlessness. More
often than not, Mr. Ford said, these
arguments were sent out without his
having read them at all. He repeat
edly stated, however, that he assumed
full responsibility for the propaganda.
and In his answers to questions pro
pounded by Attorney Elliott G. Stev
enson, representing the Tribune, he
re-affirmed all of the essential sent!
ments put -in print by Mr. Delavigne.
He interposed one Important quali
fication regarding the use of the word
"preparedness." What he meant, he
said, was "over-preparedness." In

Stevenson pointed out that in not one

CONVENTION
SUNDRY CIVIL
APPROPRIATION
BILL FIGHT ON
WASHINGTON, July 15. Consider
ation In the house today of the sundry
civil appropriation bill as remodeled
to meet the objections raised by the
president In vetoing it, precipitated a
partisan battle, which finally prevent
ed further progress on the measure
and ended only when the Republicans
forced through a motion to adjourn.
The discussion began when the rules
committee brought in a special rule for
the immediate consideration of the ap
propriation changed to provide $12.
000,000 for the rehabilitation of
wounded soldiers and sailors, instead
of $6,000,000, as originally carried.
Democrats opposed the resolution,
declarin If it were adopted and the
sudry civil bill would be passed, It
would enable the Republicans to evade
placing themselves on record as being
opposed to the president's veto, and
therefore, opposed to an Increase In
the appropriation for the vocational
training board. They contended that
a president's veto, according to the
constitution, would have to be reject
ed or accepted by a record vote.
Republicans argued, however, that
such a course was backed by prece
dent and would expedite action on the
measure. Speaker Gillette overruled
a point of order raised by minority
Leader Champ Clark, and the resolu
tion was adopted by a substantial ma
jority. Debate on the appropriation bill
itself resulted from attempts of Demo
crats and Representative Madden, Re
publican Illinois, ' to Increase the vo
cational training opproprlatlon. It
was contended that the first duty or
the country was to provide for its In
jured soldiers, regardless of the ex
pense, and that $12,000,000 was en
tirely inadequate. The amendments
were opposed by Chairman Good of
the appropriations committee, who de
clared that even $12,090,000 was more
than the vocational board had ever
asked for.

July 12, 1917, as organizer of the A.
P. of L. He saw the defendant Woo
ten on that day. He went on to state
that he was deported on that day. He
declared that Wooten had a 30-30 rifle
and caused him to be put in line. He
said: "Wooten and others were at
the P. D. store when a Mr. Baer took
me over there and Wooten ordered
me to get in line, or in center of a
circle formed by armed men. Woot
en asked if I had not declared his
business unfair and I told him that
the American Federation of Labor
had done so. After I was ordered in
line others were placed in the circle

Said when he entered the car he saw
John C. Greenway and Dr. Bledsoe in
the guard line, also Sheriff Wheeler.

I was ordered into the circle by
Wooten with Freeman Crouch. Wit
ness did not remember who was in
the circle with him. After ten more,
the order was given to fall in line,
six or eight of us. After leaving the
store I did not see Wooten again;
don't remember who were the men
put in line at depot; stopped at Hob
brook shaft, enroute to Johnson' Ad
dition; men were added to the line
at both places. At Lowell Bill
Cleary, Chas. White and others were
added to the line; at Lucco'h place
others were brought into line; stop
ped at top of hill near Bakerville and
thence to the Warren Park; at the
park others were there ahead of us;
knew some of them but don't remem
ber names; don't know if Wooten
was at the park; did not see him;
Cunningham and Sherman walked
ahead of me.
Continuing witness said he went to
Wooten's place to demand a union
house card, as chairman of the griev
ance committee of the union, and
acted with other committee mem
bers; the committee was one of the
Warren District Trades assembly,
composed of various unions. Witness
thought miners union was represent
ed but was not certain; committee
was named by motion; don't know
where records of union meeting are;
about July 12th the union office was
visited by so-called members of the
Loyalty League aad papers were
scattered.
The witness said the I. W. W.
strike was called on June 27th; a
week later some electricians went
out. Witness said carpenters and
painters were 'Striking for better wa
ges; were receiving $5 for eight
hours and demanded $6; the I. W.
W. strike included miners only.
Witness was questioned at more
length regarding strikes of the va
rious unions which disclosed that on
ly a few had struck as unions. Only
about 30 regular union miners were
not members of the I. W. W. Metal
miners union.
Witness said the I. W. W. strike
was called because of bad workiug
conditions; heard men complain of
hot places and dusty places in mines
and hard work; flat rate of six dol
lars per day was demanded. The
wage was $6.15 when strike was call
ed on the scale fixed by varying
price of copper. A demand was made
for representation on the hospital
management which are maintained
by the working men and managed by
the companies; do not know it the
hospital fees of men maintains the
hospitals. Witness said at one meet

to means of preventing the I. W. W.

troble and promised to try to get a
copy of the constitution and by-laws
of state trade assembly.
Witness was asked cause for de
claring Wooten's business unfair;
said he thought the reason was that
Woden belonged to the building ex
change and was working against car
penters and painters. The builders
exchange was advertising for scab
carpenters and painters; the striking
of carpenters and painters' union was
sanctioned by trades council. The
witness mentioned other businesses
in the district which were declared
unfair. At the time the witness went
to demand a union card from Woot.
en he was only man in Bisbee carry
ing a card in clerks' union, which is
sued card.
Short Court Recess
After a short court recess the cross
examination of Brown continued.
Witness said clerks were not on
strike; they were extinct as a union
at that time; I don't know if the
carpenters and painters had a right
to call for Wooten's card which had
been issued by the clerk's union;
Wooten asked me for my credentials,
I told him I did not have them with
me. I left and never returned. The
trades assembly ordered me to se-i
cure the card by law, but I had done I
nothing when the deportation oc-
curred; purpose of declaring Wooten
unfair was to prevent union mechan
ics from trading with him; I thought
Wooten was a good man, former un
ion man and I thought he could be
shown the error of his way; never
talked to any man declared unfair
but Wooten.
Witness said he knew Bill Cleary
who was put into line of deported
men at Lowell; heard Cleary speak
in park; he said he was not repre
senting either the trades assembly or
the Squaredealer newspaper, but
spoke of the men on strike.
Witness reached Columbus July
12th, went back to Hermanos, then
back to Columbus on July 15th, Left
Columbus on Oct. 19. Witness said
he had a conference with Bill Cleary
at Columbus; he was there, probably
six weeks. Went away and came
back; it was after Cleary's return
that I talked to him about affidavits
prepared for each deported man to
sign telling of his past history; Em
bree had charge of the affidavits.
Was only detained in Columbus 8
days and after that men began to
leave. Witness said he advised men
to remain together because I believ
ed something would be -done to re
turn the deported men to Bisbee, I
felt that all had a right to be return
ed.
Witness said that in addition to
Bill Cleary two other lawyers, Fred
Moore and Mr. Struckmeyer, visited
the camp, but that he had not talked
to them. Witness said that while at
Columbus he wrote to Wiley E. Jones
at Phoenix. He thought a Mr. Gib
bon was at Columbus at the time
camp broke up. Said he returned to
Bisbee and went to Tombstone to
report on draft call. My impression
was that I could remain in Bisbee on
ly two days.
Freeman Crouch's Testimony
. Freeman Crouch, who said he had
been deported from Bisbee," said he
had heard Wooten make remarks as
to why Brown had been in the "ring."
Witness 6aid he was already sur
rounded by armed men when Brown
was put in the ring and some one
said, "you have no business here;
what are you doing here, I rown?"
Wooten then said:
"I'd like to know why; he told me
my place was unfair." He said while
at the ball park he had seen a man
approach other men and talk with
them and take notes. He thought
the men were being offered work. No
one came to offer work on that day,
he said, but a few days previous a
man from the Holbrook mine of the
'S GUEST, COMMONER'S HER
Phelps Dodge corporation had come
to his home and told him he would
give him until Friday to return (O
work; that if he hid not return by
that date the company never would
employ him again.
He .said he had favored striking as
the men never did get what they
were entitled to," and said that "ac
cording to law" he was in favor o!
picketing.
No other testimony was offered by
the prosecution, and none by the defense.

won in straight heats and the time,
2:03Vi, 2:03 and 2:05, was fact.
Goldie Todd was a heavily played fav

Murphy made it two victories for
the day by capturing the 2:15 pace
with Sanardo.
Belleal Cantara was picked to win
the 2:15 pace, but South Bend Girl
showed her heels to the field and won
off the reel.
The 2:12 trot, raced on the half mile
track, was stubbornly fought and went
four heats before being decided. It
turned out to be another upset, for
the favorite, Miss Woodbine, was
never dangerous, and P.eter Billiken,
won the .first .third and fourth heats.

and Preserves
Good home preserving is now easy to
accomplish. Even the housewife who
"never has any luck" with all sugar pre
serving can put up fruit perfectly if she will
first make her preserving syrup with xt
Karo (Red Label) and X sugar instead
of sugar alone.
By this method you can always have the
finest, most delicious jams, good clear jellies;
and preserves with a rich, heavy syrup.
Karo is a fine, clear syrup, with a natural
affinity for the fruit juices.
It blends the fruit with the sugar, doing
away with one of the great difficulties of
putting up fruit at home, and just about
cutting the work in half.
You can depend on it that fruit put up
by this method will never grow tough or
"candy" in the glass.
For Cooking, Baking and Candy Making Karo
(Red Label) is used in millions of homes.' In all
cooking and baking recipes us Karo instead of
sugar. It is sweet, of delicate flavor, and brings
out the natural flavor of the food. .

officer any control in the affairs of the organization, and we believe
this line of stuff is distasteful to the common membership." ,

tend the meeting and evidently did not understand the situation here.
There was considerable prejudice engendered, particularly in
Maricopa county, over the apparent effort of .officers to monopolize
control of the organization. The officers themselves recognized this
and the great majority of them were in' favor of letting the dough
boy get it out of his system aad run the works, eliminating all of
ficers if necessary from any active part in the management. ;
When the convention assembled at Tucson this sentiment was
rampant. The officers accepted in good grace and took seats in the
back row. What was the result? All but one of the delegates to
Minneapolis are officers, not because they are officers, but because
of their recognized ability and experience in these matters.
There was more than guff in the revolt of the doughboy and it
worked out well all around. The honors were pretty evenly divided
between the men with the bars and those without, which is as it
should be. (Tucboh Citizen.)
PREPARING TO PAY.
MATHIAS ERZBERGER, vice chancellor and minister of fi
nance in the German government, tells the National As
sembly at Weimar that Germany must endure heavy taxes
to meet the expenses of the republic and pay the war
debt. The needs, he says, must bo divided henceforth between home
and indemnities. "I am firmly resolved," he declares, "to tread the
hard path of economy." The war finance system is to cease and a
regular budget plan will be established. Germany has, among other
difficulties, a floating debt of 72,000,000,0000 marks. And so the
minister of finance says: "It is the duty of propertied peoples not
only to bow to a state of compulsion, but to achieve an inward con
viction as to the necessity of giving up all riches and all that is su
perfluous." Among the other things which might be mentioned as superfluous
are the money, goods and works of art which Germany stole from
Belgium, France and Italy. An inner conviction of the necessity to
surrender that loot would relieve the allied and associated powers
of the disagreeable task of searching it out. Regarding the aban
donment of the war finance system, the sooner it is abandoned the
better it will bo for the Germans. It was based on the expectation
that Germany would win the war and so force the Allies to pay all
costs. Germany ran up a charge account which it never expected
to pay, and is now faced by the disgraceful necessity of liquidating
the debt.
We cannot weep over the plight of the Germans. They are get
ting only a fraction of the" hardships they inflicted on invaded coun
tries and their portion, as fixed by the peace treaty, is mild by com-'
parison ith what they proposed to do us and cur associates in the
war had victory perched on the soiled escutcheon of Prussia.

THE WORLD'S CREDIT FOUNDATION. j
UK MODERN business world is built on credit, and the most
of modern civilization is built on business.
Credit, hitherto built on broad foundations according to
tested principles, is now a vast inverted pyramid with its
apex on the shifting sands.
Gold payments, the accepted test of national credit stability, have
everywhere beer, suspended. The refusal of the Bank of England td
redeem its promises in gold has always been a sign that the last
bulwark against universal banruptcy was cracking. That bank has
paid out no gold for five years.
No nation 13 meetiug its obligations. Billions of dollars of paper
money have llowed over the world with a flood that has lifted the
price level to demoralizing heights. All these are promises to pay
gold. None of these promises are now being met. Business relations
are maintained on the hope that the payment Is but deferred. But
that hope has been so long deferred that the busiaess heart is very
sick.
Other billions, unimaginable ten years ago, have been issued an
bonds. Those of Germany, Austria, Turkey and Russia seem cer
tainly lost. But the threads of the credit web interlace closely all
across the world. Tearing out such great sections strain aid threaten
its stability everywhere.
Moreover most of these billions were borrowed to buy things to
destroy and be destroyed, and have done their work. The world
went to the verge, if not over the verge of bankruptcy to buy fuel
for a frightful bonfire. The money is spent. That security is de
stroyed. Great financiers in every land now say the only way out lies
through greater debts, because Europe has destroyed so much more
must be given it. Oniy by stretching the thin and torn web of credit
over the whole world can it be rebuilt.
It cannot be rebuilt upon the old materials. They arc gone. It
must be built upon faith in the power of proples to govern themselves,
produce wealth and keep their promises.
Destroying that faith invites a universal smash. Tearing down
the fabric of production means universal misery. To attempt to ex
ploit that production for immediate personal profit, runs the risk or
killing the faith upon which production rests.
A new age caa grow from the old only if the soil is not destroyed.
Social institutions are of long evolution. Breaks in the chain make
necessary long new processes of preparation.
To ho concrete, it is a bad time to start profiteering and smash
ing u lions, if the world's credit is to be restored to life. Rccipro
tally, because industry and production, as organized today, rest on
credit, it is a bad time to start a fracas that will smash credit. The
world's future bancs on the f.iith that men a id wonun will continue
to work and produce wealth. If that faith fails, the rest will bring
little hope or comfort to this generation.
The reactionary and the revolutionist alike are arousing cosmic
forces that might easily l.e nianagrcl and directed in other times but
that tod;iy ran as easily wrfH; tho h.-st of what the pats has gained,
the present possesses or the future promises.
STATE TO GET 300

AGED MAN FOUND
DEAD ON THE DESERT
YUMA, July 15. Alone in death,
even as he had been in life, and with
no one to minister to him in his dying
moments, C. A. Pitkin, an aged man,
who resided alone on his ten-acre
ranch, four miles north of this city,
passed away possibly late Thursday,
on the desert near his home. The
body was discovered by R. C. Wood, a
neighbor yesterday afternoon. The re
mains were in a bad state of disinte
gration and indication are that death
had occurred more than ?.6 hours be
fore. Autopsy showed that death was
from natural causes. Deceased was a
familiar figure on the streets of
Yuma. He came to the city every day
brinsing his lunch. He read the daily
papers and early in the evening walk
ed back to hi3 ranch. He was a mem
ber of the First Baptist church of
Yuma and regularly attended the Sun
day morning service. Following the
service he would eat hi3 lunch at the
church. Mr. Pitkin resided in this
vicinity for a number of years. About
a year ago he secured ten acres of
land on the mesa and after building a
little home there started to improve
the ground for cultivation.

two men remaining had spit all the

got on the bucket and given the firing

NEW YORK, July 15. The board of
boxing control in an official statement
tonight announced that but 47 seconds
of the third rest period had elapsed in
the Dempsey-Willard bout when Wil

ring as a token of defeat. The board
also decided the bout ended in the
third round. These decisions were
made as a result of numerous inquiries
received from all parts of the country.
The statement, which was signed by
Adam Empie, secretary to the board,
is as follows:
"A report having widely circulated
that Mr. W. Warren Barbour time
keeper appointed by this board for the
Wiliard-Dempsey contest, had written

Barbour has written no such letter and
further that the statement reported to
be confined in the alleged letter is
contrary to the fact, as only 47 sec

given by Willard's seconds.

statement concerning the situation in
Korea was given out today by the mis
sion on the relations with the Orient
of the Federal Council of the Churches
of Christ, in America, of which Com
missioner William Havener is chair
man and Sidney L. Gulick i3 secretary.
"The reports of atrocities against
the Korean population and especially
against the native Christians that
have been coming from Korea for sev

dant detail by a special teport about
to be issued by the mission on rela
tions with the Orient of the Federal
Council of the Churches of Christ in
America.
"The commission wishes to make
clear that while it has no jurisdiction
to speak on the political issues at
stake at Korea, yet, as representing
the Christian sentiment if a majority
of the American churches it cannot
remain silent when a defenseless peo
ple are made the victims of massacre.
"After nearly three months' study
of the Korean situation, this com
mission Is Issuing a statement based
on the examinationof about 1000
pages of manuscript reports of com
mittees, letters aul the personal ac
counts of responsible eye witnesses to
the events attending the Korean dem
onstrations in favor of national inde

charge that the Japanese colonial sys

Koreans is thoroughly russian in Its
military severity and Its treatment of

"The recent movement for indepen

their country from national extinction
and for the elemental rights of justice,
such as the use of their own language,
freedom of the press, of speech and as

by Japan.
"They hoped by peaceful demon

conquerers to attract the attention of
the peace conference to their cause.

the Japanese 'banzai' or to our 'hur

violent attempted, nor were arms
borne by the revolutionists. In scores
of cases these defenseless demonstra
tors were fired upon by Japanese
troops and killed or wounded by hun
dreds. In other instances, native high
school students of both sexes who had
joined the processions In behalf of
Korean liberty, were imprisoned and
tortured. The stripping and beating
of girl demonstrators and the brutal
treatment of Korean women by Japan
ese soldiers were frequent while bands
of armed Japanese thugs were turned
loose upon the Korean crowds.
"From March 1 to April 11, 361 Ko
reans were known to have been killed
and 860 wounaed. The indignities to
a few foreign missionaries and espe
cially the arrest and. imprisonment of
the Rev. Eli M. Mowry, are already
known in America. The latest reports
are to the effect that the arrest and
torture of suspected persons by the po
lice were continuing and that a reign
of terror prevailed.

federal council's commission has met
with an appreciative response from
the following cablegram just re

premier of the imperial cabinet:
" 'I desire to assure you that the re

of the Japanese government in Korea

declared on various occasions, the

in Korea at the time of annexation,
nearly ten years ago. calls for sub
stantial modification to meet the alter

the two Indians had confessed to the
murder some time ago, but both en
tered a plea of not guilty.
Former Senator Hubbell, brother of
the murdered man was in Flagstaff
to attend the trial and in speaking
of it. said:
"There have been a number ol
murders of a similar nature in which
the body of the victim had been
burned or attempt made to burn the
body. I believe that the murders
have not been committed altogether

STOCKS AND BONDS
NEW YORK, July 15. Pools ana
speculative interests generally were
again in undisputed control of the
stock market today, resuming their
bullish operations in the face of devel
opments which ordinarly would have
given rise to no little concern. Absc-
ute demoralization in the foreign ex
change market as indicated by the
acute weakness of rates on London
and Paris and increased discrimina
tion against the industrial collateral
caused only occasional interruption in
the market's further advance.
Yesterday's favorites, notably Cruci
ble Steel, Baldwin Locomotive and
Stutz Motors were again prominett,
but less sensational in their move
ments. Numerous miscellaneous shares
contributed to the increased dealings.
rails also manifesting strength, but
losing ground later, when leaders re
acted one to two points.
Shippings were under persistent
pressure, reflecting the disturbing con
ditions in that industry and oils var

response to the general advance quot

3 to almost 12 points were made by
American, Sumatra and Lorillard To

Steel common, Crucible Steel, Gull

CHICAGO, July 15. It was a see

from 2c decline to a rise of 60c.
Traders In corn displayed much
more caution on both sides of the mar

Bulls were inclined to go slow in view
of the current agitation against inflat

other hands, bears suffering from re

nerve to attempt to press prices down
