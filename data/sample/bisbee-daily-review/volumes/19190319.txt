PARIS. March 18 (By the Associ

made at the close of a conference to
day between President Wilson, David
Llcyd George, the British prime min
ister and M. Clemenceau, the French
premier, that no final decisions had
I .een taken. but that all the main qus-
uons surrounding the Deace confer
ence had been discussed, that the
meeting had been entirely satisfactory
and that there had been no change in
the plans previously announced, which
contemplates the the completion . of
the peace treaty within the next two
weeks, including the league of na
tions.
The conference was an extended
one, lasting from 3 o'clock in the af
ternoon to 6 o'clock in the evening. It
had been intended that the meeting
should occur at the "White House"
but the program was changed and the
conferees met in the apartment of

headquarters.

delegation and M. Loucher. French
minister of reconstruction, visited the
apartment of Colonel House.
Great interest attached to the meet

It developed that no differences in
opinion existed on the financial terms
of the treaty. While no authoritative
statement was made there is reason to
believe that the territorial question
of the league of nations figured in the
deliberations. No final decisions were
reached but the genera.1 trend of the
discussion was favorable and tended
to dissinnte any apparent divergencies
in viewpoint.
That general satisfaction was felt

SAN FRANCISCO, March IS. "The
cost of the war in money alone was
;i97,000,O00,O0i or $11,000,000,000
more than the total property value of
all of North .America," Secretary of
War Newton D. Baker told a gather
ing at the Commonwealth Club here to
day following his arrival with Gen
eral Peyton C. March, chief of staff,
to inspect Army posts here.
"The deaths from wounds in bat
tle numbered 7,300,000 and the total
deaths, in all the armies reached a
grand total of 9,000,000," he said.
Referring to the proposed League of
nations. Secretary Baker said:
Unless such an organization was
formed under some name and under
some constitution, anarchy bred by
disease, hunger and despair, would
overwhelm the earth.
"No child born In the text hundred
years will escape paying a consider
able portion of the debt this war has
brought about."
Secretary Baker and General March
left late today for San Diego.
But for the signing of the armistice,
the secretary told the club members,
Germany's armies would have been
surrounded and captured. He con
tinued: "Germany did not surrender because
ot industrial or political chaos at
home, but because she was militarily
beaten and she was beaten by an army
of young Americans who a year before
had been behind counters and follow
ing plows, practically none of whom
ever had heard a shot fired In anger."

Regulations Governing Con

of Life Insurance
(By Review Leased Wire)
WASHINGTON. March 18 Secre
tary Glass today approved regulations
governing conversion of soldiers and i
sailor's war-time insurance to stand
ard forms of government life insur
ance. The policies will be ready for
issuance soon and the work of issuing
and maintaining the policies is expect
ed to make the war risk bureau the
largest life insurance agency in the
world. - ' '
A treasury announcement explain
ing that the forms of policies which
may be obtained at option in exchange
lor term insurance of war-time, are:
ordinary life, 20 payment life, 30 pay
ment life, 20 year endowment, 30 year
endowment, and endowment payable
at the age of 62.
Premium Rates Low
"The premium rates for these con
verted policies are lower than those
charged by private insurance com
panies," said the announcement. In
previous' announcements it was said
the rates would be 30 per cent lower.
"The policies contain exceedingly
liberal provisions, continued the an
nouncement, "providing for cash and
loan values, paid up and extended in
surance and further providing that the
insured will be paid for life a monthly
income in the event that he becomes
totally and permanently disabled. All
of these policies are incontestable
from the date of issue and are free
from restrictions as to residence,
travel or occupation.
'"The holders of the policies will be
eligible to share in and receive divi
dends from gains and savings and the
proceeds of the policies are exempt
from all taxation.
Payable Monthly
"Premiums on the new forms of gov
ernment life insurance are payable
monthly but may be paid annually,
semi-annually, or quarterly. The
monthly premium, due the first oi
each month may be paid at any time
during the month."
Secretary Glass expwssed the opin
ion that the "usual values and liberal
provisions" of the new .forms "should
encourage all holders of war-time term
insurance to convert as rapidly as
their financial circumstances will per
mit and in any event to continue with
out fail the largest possible propor
tion of their present insurance.
An opinion by Attorney General
Palmer that insurance might be paid
to the estate of deceased persons to
day removed the last obstacle to is
suance of the new policies.

WASHINGTON, March 18. Re
plying to a recent statement by
Representative Mann of Illinois,
Representative Longworth of Ohio,
republican, issued a statement to
day asking the former republican
floor leader to "keep his hands off

JESS WILLARD BEGINS
TRAINING FOR TITLE
BOUT WITH DEMPSEY
Managers of Champ and Chal
lenger Complete Prelim
inary Agreements
(By Review Leased Wire)
NEW YORK, March 18. At an in
formal conference here tonight the
managers of Jess Willard and JacH
Dempsey discussed 'the heavyweight
championship contest, scheduled for
July 4, with Promoter Tex Packard,
preparatory to arranging for prelim
inary training. WillaTd was represent
ed by Ray Archer, Dempsey's plans
were explained by Jack eKarns.
Both managers stated they were in
this city prepared to engage sparring
partners for their principals and each
carried a list of heavyweight boxers
from which it was said they would be
selected. Archer said that he was pre
pared to take at least two such help
ers back to Lawrence. Kans., with him
when he leaves for Willard's home
town at the end of the week.
Willard Already Training
According to the champion's man
ager, Willard already has begun light
physical work and is a trifle below 260
pounds in weight. He is particularly
desirous of getting sparring partners
of about the height and weight of
Dempsey and specif ies they must be
fast, hard-hitting two-handed punch
ers. Willard will not use the heavy
type of partner with whom he trained
when he was preparing for Johnson in
Havana.
The champion will do all of his worK
at his home in Lawrence until six
weeks before the bout when, accord
ing to the terms of his contract with
Rickard. he will move to the scene of
the titular battle. n the interim, how
ever, Willard will find time to star
in a moving picture drama in which he
will appear as the hero. He will be
filmed doing his actual training work,
will take part in a ring battle and pre
sumably will also stage a ricture res
cuing the beautiful heroine from im
pending danger. Willard's stipend for
submitting himself to the camera will
be J 10O.000, it is reported.
Dempsey to Take Rest
Dempsey expects to leave for Palm
Beach tomorrow for a week or ten
days of rest before engaging in an
athletic-vaudeville tour of a month dur
ing which he will swing as far west j j
as Kansas and then, by a southern j 1
route, return to the east. Before he j
leaves he expects to purchase a large j
farm near Freehold. N. J., where thej
challenger will do such training as;
may.be necessary before moving onj
to the scene of the bout. Kearns said j
that Dempsey "weighed 197 pounds, at j
present, and would enter the ring at
between 192 and 195 pounds." according
to the altitude at which the bout is
stased. ' j
He will begin- serious training on
May 1 and will have as sparring part- j
tiers the largest and heaviest men who :
can be engaged in order that he may
become accustomed to boxing with
men as near as possible the physical
standard of Willard. Andre Anderson
is the only one mentioned to date. I
Rickard plans to return to his Texas
oil fields tomorrow and will te ao
sent from this city for several weeks.
He stated positively tonight that he
would not announce the site of the
contest, the referee or other data until
April and that he did not expect to in
vestigate any prospective fight sites
while away.

Shots were fired at policemen
from tenement houses while they
were struggling with leaders of
the parade and tonight the police
exchanged shots with occupants
of a house who made an effort to
prevent them from arresting a
man who had thrown a stone at
an officer. There were two other
conflicts in which no shots were
fired..
Twenty-one men arrested during
the early rioting were held under
$500 bonds each on charges of in
citing to riot. Four men arrested
because of tonight's disturbances
will be arraigned tomorrow.

THE BISEEE DAILY REVIEW, WEDNESDAY MARCH 19, 1919.
CBv Review Leased Wire)
NEW YORK. March 18. Delegates
from all the ailed countries are bring
ing a comparison of methods of re
habilitating war victims at a four
" day international conference on re
habilitation of the disabled, which
opened here today under the auspices
of the .Red Cross. Out of the con
ference, it Is expected, will te de
veloped for each country new methods
for the restoration to society of all
the injured, comprising the best ele
ments of the varoius methods now in
use.
Plans for extension of the work to
the hundreds of thousands of persons
crippled every year in industry also
are to be taken up at the conference.
Today's session was given over to
short outlines of the rehabilitation
plans of the various countries, speak
ers including some of the most prom
inent exponents of the movement in
the United States, France, Italy,
England, Belgium and Canada.
Dr. Bourillon Speaks
Dr. Maurice Bourillon,. president of
the permanent Interallied committee
on war cripples, director of the
w French national institute for crippled
T soldiers and known as "the grand
- father of reeducation," was the first
speaker.
France he said, so far as possible,
is training the disabled to resume
their pre-war trades, but that where
this is impossible they are being
trained for new vocations according
to their preferences and abilities.
New laws, he said, give them pensions
and five years preference in civil po
" sitions in the national government.
Belgium's work was described by
Prof. Louis Alleman, director of the
government institute for cripples at
Port Villez, France. The Belgian
work so far, he said, had been con
ducted by civilian organizations, but
a bill providing for national rehabili
tation of soldiers "will undoubtedly be
pr.ssed soon.
Italy's Work Described
Prof. Vittorio PuttI, a famous Ital
ian orthopedic surgeon .and director
of the Rizzoli institute at Bologna,
described Italy's plan, which includes
15 days compulsory attendance by
each convalescent soldier at a voca
tional training school. This brief
. period, he said, was sufficient to con
.vvince virtually all the men of the-ad-i
visability of taking a complete course.
Preference in' certain government po
sitions also has been instituted in
Italy as a means of providing places
for wounded soldiers, he said.
F. Gerald Robinson, deputy minister
of the Canadian department of sol
diers civil. reestablishment and W, E.
Segsworth, director of vocational
training in the department, described
the three-part Canadian plan of re
habilitating her wounded the ward
occupations designed to keep the bo!
diers cheerful during convalescence;
the curative workshops where heavier
work is given and the industrial re
training schools to which the men are
sent when physically he'aled.
England's Plan
England, said Mrs. Ethel Wood, sec
retary of the local war pensions
committee of London, is offering vo
cational training not only to the
wounded, but to soldiers who were
minors when they enlisted, to uni
versity, students, whose courses were
interrupted and to widows of slain
soldiers.
America's program, as built up
from the experiences of the allied na
tions, was outlined by Col. Frank Bil
lings, chief, and Lieut. Col. Joseph
L. Miller, assistant chief of the divis
ion of physical rehabilitation in the
surgeon general's office.
Under the American plan. Colonel
Billings said, no soldier will be dis
charged from the Army intil he has
fully recovered physically and all who
t desire will be given full vocational
. retraining.
j Some difficulties are being encoun-
tered, he said, in obtaining sufficient
Instructors for the retrainng work.
The 48 reconstruction hospitals now
operating, he said, have only 1200
. women reconstruction aids, 600 enlist-
ea instructors ana luo commissioned
f officer instructors.

ers would boycott Arizona, showing
no more Arizona scemes. Later ad
vices were received that a delegation
of picture producers was on its way
from the coast to explain their oppo
sitino to the bill.
The peice of legislation which has
raised this latest storm provides in
the first place for the licensing of
all moving picture producers doing
business in the state.
Another clause would give the cor
poration commission authority to send
investigators into the home office, no
matter where located, of any com
pany operating in Arizona "and thor
oughly inspect and examine its affairs
to ascertain its true financial con
dition." Film companies also would
be required to file heavy bonds to
maintain exchanges in the state and
make a complete report of their ope
rations to the corporation commis
sion. The bill attracted very little atten
tion in the legislature. It was passed
through the house, but at first failed
in the senate. Thereafter the upper
chamber was bombarded with tele
grams from moving picture theatre
owners protesting against the killing
of the bill, so it was revived, passed
and now awaits the governor's "ac

Hollocher stood fourth in the sea
son's averages of regulars, with a bat
ting average of .315. He played in 131'
games and garnered a total of 161 safe
wallops.
In the fielding end of the game, his
work in the short field was even of
higher quality than his ability as a
swatsmith. He accepted 749 chances
during the season, - is credited with
278 putouts, and 413 assists. He made
53 errors, closing the season with a
fielding average of .929. His average
! would have been considerably higher
were it not for the fact that he covers
more ground than the ordinary shart
stop, getting errors on chances that
other players would not accept.
Hollocher is 5 feet, 8 inches tall, and
weighs 160 pounds. He throws right
handed and bats left.

And the State Will Pay
The state of Arizona has an attorney general who is furnished with
three assistant attorneys general. These gentlemen are supposed to have
charge of the state's legal business. That is what they are paid for.
Possibly they ought to be paid more. Possibly there should be more
assistant attorneys general. But that is beside the. point and is wholly
a subject for legislative consideration.
The attorney general and his assistants are supposed to represent
the tax commission as its legal advisers. But the tax commission wants
another lawyer. The attorney general does not appear to meet the com
mission's requirements. Possibly his notions of law are at variance with
those of the commission. If so, that may be his fault, or conceivably it
may be the commission's fault. The commission has some tax legisla
tion on hand and seems to think the attorney general should not handle
it. Possibly the commission wants a lawyer who .will handle that legis
lation with a little more enthusiasm than the attorney general has shown!
And possibly, the attorney general's lack of enthusiasm, if he does lack
enthusiasm for that particular legislation, is not blameworthy. We do
not know.
Bu the tax commission wants another lawyer and the legislature
has passed a law which authorizes the commission to employ its own
lawyer or lawyers, and the governor is thinking the law over and may kill
it or pass it into the body of our laws.
We do not know how much the commission is to be allowed to spend
on lawyers. Possibly the amount is limited, but it may be unlimited. If
it is unlimited, so much the better for the lawyers. If it Is limited, so
much the worse for the commission and the lawyers.
The subject is Interesting. " Certainly the porporation commission
also ought to be empowered to hire Its own lawyers if the tax commis
sion is given that power. The corporation commission is the most Im
portant commission we have. But let us not overlook the commission
of agriculture and horticulture. The attorney general is no fanner. Should
not that commission have its lawyer? And there is the board of control,
which tops them all. Who shall advise it ? Surely not the attorney
general.
The board of regents of the University have a world of money to
spend. How can they spend it economically and efficiently without we
give the board its own lawyer. And the livestock sanitary board ought
not to be forgotten, to say nothing of the sheep sanitary commission.
Then there is the state land department. Why allow it to plow the
unchartered fields of legal mystery and controversy with no other guid
ance than that of the attorney general?
It is large as well as interesting. The supervisor of dry farms should
not be expected to take his legal problems tothe present attorney gen
raL And, we have a bee inspector. What menfber of the legal pro
fession will volunteer to sting him and how -much will it cost? The
state veterinarian should have a lawyer who is expert in horseback
opinions, even if it does cost something. . r . .
Altogether the prospects of the legal profession are looking up. Of
course, the attorney general should not be left without official duties,
but give the other, lawyers s. chance. We can allot the state historian
to the attorney general as his particular client, and between them they
can write history as well as make it. .
It was a long time ago that the Savior said, "Woe unto you lawyers!
for ye took away the key of knowledge!, ye entered not in yourselves,
and them that were entering in, ye hindered."
The tax commission seeks the key of knowledge of the legal myster
ies that encompass it and does noJ think the attorney general has it. But
if the key is lost, some of the lawyers must have it; so give them all a
chance to produce and the state will pay.
' '. Metropolitan Menaces
New York announces with pride that its population now is 6,000,000
or approximately 6 per cent of the total population of the United States.
Every year New York adds 250,000 to its total.
Nearly 65 per cent of the people of America live in cities or in
towns of considerable size. "
About 35 per cent live in small towns, villages or on farms.
A few generations back the cities and towns made up 35 per cent of
the population and the farms, small towns and villages 65.
The drift to the cities increases year by year.
Where will it end?
London is about to absorb a large part. of the district about its present
limits. When it does so its population will be nearly 10,000,000 or 20 per
cent of that of the Eritish Isles. .
In New York one office building that covers little more than on
acre of ground space but towers high, has a work day population of
,22,000 and a daily traffic that is an incoming and. outgoing flow of
250,000 persons. 1
To transport the food and fuel required each day by a city like New
York requires hundreds of trains and thousands of cars. Much of the
food comes from points a thousand or more miles away. Much of the fuel,
too, comes from sections hundreds of miles distant.
A French scientist made possible such cities as London and New
York when he invented the method of food preservation we know as
cold storage. New York could be cut off from communication with the.
rest of the world for a few weeks and live. So could London. Before .
cold storage was known such populations as these cities have today '
would perish if their lines of supply were cut. for a week. '
By a wierd trick of fate the man who invented cold storage, and
made possible as dd no other man who ever lived the feeding of
grouped millions of men, died of starvation.
The abnormal growth of cities is becoming a world menace. Nowhere .
is this menace assuming such proportions as in England and America.
How is it to be checked or abated?
Possibly by economic law. Sooner or later the waste that attends
the transportation of hundreds of millions of tons of fuel, raw material,
food, etc., from far distant points to cities like New York and London .
and the retransportation of the manufactured goods back over the same '.
routes for distrubtion and consumption must force correction ' i
Today the big cities get their poww from coal. Hydro-electric energy1
is only beginning to be developed. We hae great natural elements of
power in our rivers, in the ocean tides, in the sun and in the air. There
i3 no telling when science will harness one or the other of them so as
to minimize the present importance of coal. When that time comes
there will be lessening instead of increasing in the population of big
titles.
.Man by nature is gregarious, but such incoascionable congregating ,
of peoples as the last half century has witnessed is appalling in its
suggestion. It is unhealthy and protehtious. It draws the energy of
a nation into small units and snaps the streugth of the' whole structure
at its .source, the farm.
New York's 6,000.000 should not be considered with price but as
evidence of peril. So, too, with London's plan of a city of 10,000.000.
The world is too big lor such herding of humanity. What is not
appreciated but what is a fact is that the larger the cities grow the
greater the source of waste and the higher the cost of living for all.
There can be no general waste that does not affect all people to some
degree. Nothing that is abnormal tends to the general good.
The American girl would like to knoV how many entangling alliances ,
the Crusaders are making over there.
Marshall may have been the first presiding officer to declare the
Senate adjourned "sine Deo," but this isn't the first time the Senate

WHEN IS BEER NOT
BEER? ASK INTERNAL
REVENUE OFFICIALS
Here's Chance for Some One
to Become Famous : When
Is Brew Intoxicating?
(By Review Leased Win)
WASHINGTON. March 18. Answer
to the question of when beer is le
gally beer and whether it may legally
contain 2?i pef cent alcohol without
being legally considered intoxicating
was sought today by internal revenue
officials in existing statnes, court de
cisions and administrative legislations,
but with no definite conclusion.
Pending a decision by the legal di
vision of the bureau and an opinion by
Attorney General Palmer, Commission
er Roper declined to say what he
would do in case New York brewers
carry out their announced intentions
of resuming manufacture and sale of
beer containing 2 per cent alcohol
under President Wilson's recent order
permitting the making of "near beer."
Internal revenue bureau officials held
a number of conferences and the bu
reau's legal experts argued that all
precedents of acts of congress and
revenue bureau practices point to the
rule that if beer contains one-half of
one per cent or more alcohol it is in
toxicating and is taxable as real beer.
Therefore, it was argued that the
president's order of last September 16,
forbade the use of grains or other food
products in making beer with one-half
per cent or more of alcohol.
Commissioner Roper, however, de
cided to fortify himself fully and ar
ranged to call on the department of
justice for an opinion.
In any event officials said, the manu
facture of beer with more than one
half per cent alcohol is prohibited aft
er May 1 under the food conservation
provision of the act of November 21,
1918. It' was understood that New
York brewers, however, did not agree
with this view.

The breweries in Connecticut will re
sume the manufacture of beer contain
in 2 per cent alcoholic content imme
diately, it was announced late today
following a meeting of the Connecticut
Brewers' association here.
WILL NOT MAKE BEER,
SAY MILWAUKEE MEN
MILWAUKEE, Wis., March 18.
Milwaukee brewers will not change
their attitude because of the action
of New York and New Jersey brewers,
who are going to make 24 per cent
beer on the assumption that the in
ternal revenue department had no
right to decree that only half of one
per cent beer shall be brewed, H. J.
Stark, secretary of the Pabt Brewing
company said today.
JEFFERSON CITY, Mo., March IS.
At what he termed a "school" on the
League of Nations proposal. United
States Senator James A. Reed of Mis
souri today presented his views on
the question at a joint meeting of the
senate and house of the state. legis
In opening his argument against the
league constitution as at present
drawn. Senator Reed asked how many
legislators had read the constitution
of the league. He estimated that
about one in six held nip hands.
' Visionary ,' "worse than autocracy,"
and "British plot," were some of the
expressions used by him in char
acterizing the league constitution,
which, he declared, with the exception
of slight modifications was a British
document.
Cheers for Wilson .
At one point Senator Reed was in
terrupted by cheers for President Wil
son. "I am glad to hear cheers for him,"
Senator Reed resumed, "but the pres
ident is wrong."
Cries of "no, you're wrong," again
interrupted.
The league constitution is the "most
strangely constructed document ever
put together," Senator Reed declared,
and continued:"
"Great Britain laid this plot, I un
hesitatingly charge it If she can
make our soldiers fight her fights
why shouldn't she want it?"
Was No Remedy
He said he had been asked what his-
reniedy was, and declared he did not
have to answer that question. He
compared himself to a physician, say
ing one serum might kill, but he !
would not be bound to find a cure!
for it.
"I have no remedy for war," he de
clared. "When you get so you won't
fight to defend your homes there will
be no more war."
He urged complete disarmament and
dismemberment of Germany, ' and
closed with an impassioned pica to
preserve, "not the flag of the bol
shevists, not an international flag,
but by the living God, our flag, the
American flag."-
Tonight Representative Tolson an
nounced that the 16 representatives
planned to introduce in the house to-J
morrow a resolution endorsing tne
league and supporting President Wil
son in his k efforts to have it es
tablished. ,
AMERICAN DOCKS IN
FRANCE TO BE SOLD
PARIS. March IS (By the Associ

houses, hospitals and barracks built
by the American expeditionary forces,
to the value of $165,000,000, will be
sold to France for the best figures the
American liquidation commission can
obtain. None of these can readily or
profitably be removed, and the only
alternative is to sell at the best bar
gain. The liquidation commission is now
negotiating for the disposal of various
surplus properties belonging to the ex
peditionary forces. Hundreds of thou
sands of uniforms have been dyed, so
that they may now serve other armies,
such as the Belgian, Polish and some
of the Balkan states.

After Taking Tanlac Thirty
Days He Says He's in
"Pink of Condition"
"I have picked up at least 20 pounds
in the past 30 days by taking Tanlac,
and now I'm just in the pink ot con
dition all around." This statement
was made by William M. Edmonds, a
well known employee of the Seattle
Street Car company, living at 760
North 74th. street. .Seattle, recently.
"My stomach," he continued, "has
been giving me all kinds of trouble
for years. What I ate seemed to do
me harm instead of good, as it would
sour on my stomach and cause me so
much misery. I could hardly get my
breath at times on account of the gas,
which would press on my heart and
cause it to palpitate fearfully. I was
badly constipated, my kidneys were
in bad shape, and I was never free
from pain in the small of my back. I
couldn't sleep at all well and would
lay awake for hours every night before
getting a wink of sleep. I also had
rheumatism in my arms and legs, and
my knees would bet so stiff at times
that I could hardly bend over.
' All my efforts to find relief failed
until I began taking Tanlac, but this
medicine has certainly put me in great
shape. My appetite was never better,
everything tastes good and my stom
ach is in such a good condition that I
can eat anything. And since the gas
has stopped forming . I'm never both
ered with palpitation, shortness of
breath or other signs of indigestion.
My kidneys don't bother me any more,
all the pain has disappeared, and 1
sleep fine every' night.
"My wife has been taking Tanlac j
for headache and a run-down condition
and her first bottle has helped her j
so much that she told me to brine hen
another today. It certainly is 'great to
do what it has for me and is the one
medicine" I don't hesitate to recom
mend." Tanlac is fold in Bisbee by J. M.

BY REVIEW
NEW YORK, March 18.Trading on
the stock exchange today was note
worthy, chiefly for the fact that the
early and intermediate sessions were
punctured by frequent periods of
apathy, in striking contrast to the high
pressure of the past fortnight.
Activity was most marked in the
final hour, when a temporary demand
for high grade rails infused strength
to the general list, but this inquiry
flattened out when other leaders react
ed one to almost five points on brisk
selling for profits and offerings for
the short account. ' 4 14
Apart from shippings, which were
particularly conspicuous with Atlantic
Gulf at an extreme advance of five
points and Marine preferred's gain of
ZVt, unwonted activity was displayed
by minor equipments, and low priced
motors and oils, again including St.
Clair.
United Cigars, California Packing,
National Biscuit and Sears Roebuck
registered two to seven point advances
at their best, but these were largely
cancelled in: the later dealings, when'
United States Steel featured the I
sweeping reversal on its sharp decline
to 94U. Sales amounted to 1,025,000
shares.
Domestic bonds, including Liberty
issues, were steady firm, the foreign
division evincing further irregularity,
however, on the continued weakness
of Paris evchange. Total soles, par
values, aggregated $10,400,000.
Old United States registered 4's rose
14 per cent on call, others unchanged.
GRAIN MARKET
..CHICAGO, March 18. Reports of
the virtual settlement of the shipping
strike at Buenos Aires weakened the
corn market today after values had
touched new high records for the sea
son. Thecl089 was unsettled, lVc
net lower fo an advance of 2c, with
May $1.4ff& to $1.42 and July $1.34i
to $1.35. " Oats finished c to lc up
and provisions with gains of 47c to $1.
Opinions that oats would be largely
substituted for corn as feeds strength
ened oats.- Sharp advances in the hog
market made provisions jump to the
maximum limit.

3 THE EISEEE DAILY REVIEW, WEDNESDAY MARCH 19, 1919.
COUNTY ROAD BOND
TO BE PUFUPTO
PEOPLE BY BOARD
.Supervisors to Hear Voters;
Urge Forest Reserve Be
Opened to Visitors
Members of the board of supervis
ors will hear residents of various sec
tions of the state on the question of
issuing road bonds for emergency
employment on Tuesday, April 8 The
forest supervisor at Tucson, in charge
of forest reserves within Cochise
county, will be requested to take Im
mediate action toward securing forest
funds for road construction In Cochise
county.
These were the salient developments
and features of the meeting last night
in the Y. M. C. A. of the Warren dis
trict community labor board. High
way legislation was discussed, means
of increasing jobs in the district and
county were considered, and members
of the legislature and board of super
visors were heard on possible plans
for aleviation of the employment
question.
Announcement that the board of su
pervisors will consider the advisability
of issuing bonds was made by C. W.
Roberts, member, after a conference
with I. C. E. Adams chairman of the
board of supervisors.
Doubts Public Opinion
Mr. Roberts had already explained
that machinery provided by recent
legislative amendments to the high
way commission bill of 1917, make
possible the raising of funds by bond
issue within little more than a month.
He doubted public opinion as to where
the roads should be constructed, and
for this reason suggested that expres
sion be had from every district in the
county.
The resolution to the forest super
visors was adopted following a report
by W. R. Ashurst, federal employ
ment agent, that a fund of about S9,
000,000 is now available for forest
reserve road work in this state and
New Mexico and that Cochise counfy
13 entitled to a certain amount of this
fund for improvement of roads and
construction of new roads upon the
reservations. The resolution call3 at
tention to unemployment conditions,
the urgent necessity of alleviation
and asks immediate action. Upon
will urge upon the forest officials the
same consideration asked in the res
olution of the community board and
citizens.
No Further Cut
. Reports of employment conditions
within the district by representatives
of two large corporations showed that
Phelps Dodge Corporation and Calu
met & Arizona Company are main
taining their force at the same levels
as last week, and that no additional
curtailment is considered. Phelps
Dodge Corporation has returned lt4
former soldiers and sailors to their
old positions while Calumet & Ari
zona has received back 90 former
service men, all of whom have been
employed
The resolution adopted . last night
follows:
"Whereas, there is at this time
gTeat numbers of unemployed men In
the state of Arizona and especially in
Cochise county, and
"Whereas, There is great need of
roads into the national forests to open
up said forests in Cochise county, to
open its resources and make said
forests accessible ot the people for
pleasure and recreation, and
"Whereas, It is understood there
is federal money available for the pur
pose of roads and trails in- said for
ests, now, therefore, be it
"Resolved, The Community Labor
Board and the citizens of Bisbee and
Coachise county respectfully request
and urge the forest supervisor of Cor
onado National forest to take such
steps as may be necessary to imme
diately begin the construction of roads
and trails within the boundaries of the
several national forests within Cochise
county, to the end that idle men may
be given employment.
"Respectfully submitted,
"J. C. White, chairman Cochise
county community labor board; R. J.
Wilbert. secretary; W. R. Ashurst, examiner."

"The New Co-Ed," a comedy play
presented by the junior class of the
high school at the auditorium last
night was a rousing success. Each of
the characters played their parts well
and the play throughout was full of in
terest. The characteristics of nobility, up
rightness, loyalty and martyrdom; and
the evils of hate, selfishness, jealously
and passion were portrayed by students
during the play which is woven around
college liie. As usual, love scenes,
parties, frolics and all the other good
things which go to make college life
a place of haven instead of a place
where one devours bdoks and dreams
of trigonometrv, were depicted.
The theme of the play showed where
the New Co-Ed entered the college a
stranger to alL She is readily re
ceived with open arms by all, except
one girl, who sees in her coming the
chance that her ' beau will fall in love
with her because of her loveliness.
True, Dick Bradley falls in love with
the New Co-Ed, and this sets aflame
the jealousy that is in the heart of
another one. However toward the end
everything is smoothed out and with
the -dropping of the rinal curtain, love
is seen to conquer and the play closes
with everyone happy and surprised
when the wedding of Dick Bradley and
the New Co-Ed is announced. Punch
Doolittle, who does some clever de
tective work; and George Washington
Watts, the faithful old colored servant,
deserve especial credit for their oddi
ties. Following is a list of the charac
ters: Letitia (Letty) WilHs Madeline

With an average or eight homes'
being quarantined every day because '.
of the prevailance cf influenza in fam-'
ilies, local physicians are of the opin-j
ion that Bisbee is undergoing a slight
recurrance of the epidemic. Dr. Brow n ;
said yesterday that the public cannot :
be told too strongly the need fori
fresh air, and to avoid congregating
in places where persons who have
colds sneeze and rough openly. The
doctor said that although pneumonia
has-been somew'iat suppressed per
sons taking cold should seek medical
aid to prevent the symptoms becom
ing more grave, thereby lessening the
chances of influenza and possible
pneumonia.
