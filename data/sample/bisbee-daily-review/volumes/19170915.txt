The crest of Monte San fiabneie,
commanding the plain of Gorizia to
the south and southeast and the Eri-

tured by the Italians, after three
weeks of the most bitter fighting, the
Italian embassy at Washington an

This news of the victory, probably
the greatest feat of the Italian army
thus far la the war, precedes the lat

statement from the Italian war office
says tha; on Thursday the fighting on
the entire Austro-Italian front was im
peded by heavy rain.
Effort Begins August 25
The Italian effort to capture San
Cabriele began after the taking 'of
Mont Santo, directly north, by Gen
eral Cadorna's troops on August 25.
Several times the Italians had reached
the summit of the great mountain, so
important to their future progress east
of Gorizia as well as on the Carso,

the slopes of the rugged rock in the

tions from the Austrians after suffer

Conflicting Statements
Except along the Casemates plateau
on the Aisne front, there has been no
marked activity tn the other fighting
fronts. A German attack against the
French positions on the Casemates

with heavy losses. Berlin says Ger

BRITISH NAM
FORCES TELL OF
Interesting Account of Eight
Encounters Between Eng
lish Ships and Submarines;
British the Victors.
(By Review Leased Wire.)
LONDON. Sept. 14. Stories ot
some recent successes of the British
navy against German submarines
were given to the public tonight in
a series of brief descriptions of eight
encounters in which eight and possi
bly nine U-boats were accounted for.
These eight sea battle pictures were
so as to cover the whole ground of
anti-submarine activities.
Anti-Sub Activities.
In one case there was a battle be
tween'an auxiliary cruiser and a sub
marine, in another an engagement be
tween a seaplane and a submarine,
then a battle between two submarines
in which the British submarine
captain proved himself the better man,
and finally two tales of successes of
armed merchantmen against the ene
my. . .
"uiser Hit
"First, from one of, our auxiliary
cruisers a f Ttiz was seea approach
ing on the sirboard beam. It jumped
out of the water when a hundred
yards off and struck the engine room
near the water line, making a large
rent and flooding several compart
ments. A starboard life boat was
blown into the air, pieces landing on
the wireless aerial. Soon after a
periscope was observed just before the
port bow. Several shots, some evi
dently effective, were aimed at the
U-boat.
Attempts Escape.
"The U-boat wallowed along for a
space with the stern almost vertical
and oil squirted from its side and the
crew came on deck and waved their
hands. At this sign of surrender
'cease fire' was ordered, whereupon
the enemy started to make off at a
fair speed, hoping to disappear in the
mist. Fire again was opened, a -loud
explosion took place forward and,
falling over on his side the enemy
sank. Two survivors were picked up.
Sub Sighted.
Second, one of our small craft sight
ed an enemy submarine at a distance
of 10,000 yards. She maintained her
course and five minutes later the
enemy submerged and shortly, after a
periscope appeared close on the star
board bow for a few seconds and then
disappeared. The helm was ported and
when over the place where the peri
scope was seen, an explosive charge
was dropped.
Submarine Hooked.
"The ship circled around and drop
ped another charge. The explosion
of this charge was followed after two
or three seconds by another much
more violent explosion which shook
the vessel from stem to stem. The
water became black over a large area
and a considerable quantity of thick
oil came to the surface.
Sub Against Sub.
"Third, one of our submarines sight
ed an enemy submarine on the star
board, but after seeing him through
a periscope for a few minutes, lost
sight of him. Our boat came to the
surface again and three hours later
saw the enemy on the starboard beam
two or three miles away. The enemy
altered bis course and again was lost
to view. He again was dected, our
to view. He again was detected, our
course was altered as necessary and
when a favorable position was obtain
ed, a torpedo was fired. A splash was
observed close to his stern and a few
seconds later the enemy was seen with
his stern out of water, smoke hang
ing around it and the conning tower
half submerged. A minute or two
j later he disappeared.

Kerensky Faces Serious Crisis
In Cabinet Extreme Fac

May Disrupt Country.
(By Review Leased Wire.)
PETROGRAD .Sept. 14.-5:50 p. m.
The political equilibrium, which the
country had expected as a result of
the collopse of the rebellion, has not
yet been reached. The cabinet crisis
continued all day. The evening news
papers agree that Premier Kerensky
is In a very difficult position, the Bir
jeviya declaring that his resignation
is not yet excluded from the possibi
lities. The cause of the trouble is an acute
revival of the old struggle for power.
Premier Kerensky persists that the
entry of four constitutional democrats
into the cabinet is indispensible, butl
opposition to this is growing among
members on the left. Kerensky also
is negotiating for the entry into the
cabinet of representatives of the Mos
cow industrial workers, and these de
clare that they will not accept port-
of olios if the constitutional democrats
are expelled. "
The - social democrats ' and social
revolutionists while continuing to op
pose the constitutional democrats de
clare that Ihey are also against the
ofrmati'jn of a purely socialist cabinet.
Problem Complicated
The problem is complicated by the
attitude of the Petrograd council of
deputies, as last night's meeting the
Bolshevikis for the first time gained
an overwhelmis. majority of 279
against 155 in for of an extremely
radical program.
This program declares that not only
the constitutional democrats but also
all representatives of propertied
classes must be excluded from power;
that the policy of compromise must be
abandoned, as it is merely a cause of
counter-ret'jlutionary plotting and fhat
exceptional powers of - repression
claimed by the government must be
relinquished.
Want Republic
It also demands the immediate
delaration of a democratic republic,
the abolition of private property and
land, with the transfer to peasants of
all stock and machinery on estates;
control by the working classes over
production, nationalization of the chief
branches of industry, "merciless taxa

of all war profits.

(Special to the Review.)
MINNEAPOLIS, Minn., Sept. 14.
Improvement in the grain shortagle
situation which for a time threatened
io force the closing of many local
flour mills, was reported today by
leading grain and flour men.
Plant Huge Crops.
Members of the Minneapolis Cham
ber of Commerce said that late re
ports indicate farmers of the north
west, expecting a price of at least $2
a bushel for next year's crop, ar
making preparations for planting one
of the largest crops n history. Har-
vesting and fall plowing have delayed
marketing of the crops and the delay
had led to reports that farmers are
holding tack their wheat because of
dissatisfaction with the government
price, according to grain men.
Plowing Cause.
"Plowing is the chief cause of the
light wheat movements," said G. F.
Ewe, former president of the cham
ber of commerce. "Knowing they will
get the government price anyway, the
farmers are doing their fall plowing
instead of rushing their wheat; to
market."
Frank L. Carey, representative ot
the government food administration,
and other grain experts supported
this view.
S.&..y V;agre.
John J. ilttiiiKh, secretary- of the
chamber of commerce, said that since
the new crop year opened, September
1, a total of 5,112.520 bushels of wheat
have been brought here as compared
with 5,952,000 bushels iu the same
period last year, showing a shortage
of 839,480 bushels. In previous years
a stock -of 7,000.000 bushels usually
has been stored here at this time, so
it was said the present supply is
meagre.
Reports Are Wrong.
NEW YORK, SepL 14. Alarmist
ports of the possibility of a flour
famine In the east are without found
ation, according to statements made
here tonight by Julius H. Barnes,
president of the food administration
grain corporation, and James F. Belt,
general chairman of the milling divi
sion of the food administration.
Tide Is Turning.
"The tide of flour is turning to
ward the east and will soon be upon
us," Mr. Barnes said. "Total receipts
in New York yesterday were 38,000
barrels and it requires some 25.000
barrels to supply this city. The food
administration has 70,000 barrels in
New York for sale to bakers, there
fore there will be no flour famine in
New York."
Price Generous.
Mr. Barnes declared the vast ma
jority of growers realize that the price
fixed by the government is not only
fair but generous. He explained that
farmers in the northwest who ordin
arily have rushed their crop to mar
ket at the earliest possible moment
in the fear that prices might
decline now understand there is no
such danger and are taking advantage
of the fine weather to do all their
fall plowing. Conditions In the south
west are the same. Mr. Barnes stated.
Not Alarming.
Mr. Bell declared no reports have
been received which would indicate
an alarming condition so far as wheat

Helping Germany
"The men who are speaking, writing

war now and against everything that
is being done to carry in the war are
rendering more effective service to
Germany than they could render In

declared the former secretary of state
amidst cheers. "It is impossible to

Likes, Like, Like
"As time goes on and the character

Bisbee is writing the final chapter in the history of the I.
W. V. Movement in the Warren District. With the same
systematic methods which characterized the wholesale depor
tation of approximately 1,200 I. W. W. members and sym
pathizers on July 1 2, Sheriff Harry Wheeler, his deputies and
the citizens of Bisbee continued arresting the deportees yester
day as fast as they arrived in the district irom the detention
camp at Columbus, N. M. One hundred have been arrested
since Wednesday, when the exodus from the exile camp at
Columbus started westward toward the Warren District.
Sixty-Five Arrested.
Sixty-five were arrested at Douglas, Osborn, Forest
Ranch and along other roads entering Bisbee yesterday. As
rapidly as they are arrested by deputy sheriffs they are brought
here and formal charges of vagrancy are made against them
in the police court.
One Fails.
Only one man, R. G. Noble, failed to fulfill the police
court s cnoidtion and he was found guilty on a charge of vag
rancy yesterday by Judge Thomas and was released on bond.
The usual penalty fixed by the police court is 90 days in jail.
Married Men Stay.
Six married men, whose families live in the district, were
told yesterday by Sheriff Wheeler that they may remain in the
district so long as they behave themselves and comply with
the laws. However they are expected to leave, as it is known
that none of the operating companies will give any of them
employment.
Slackers In JaiL
The twelve slackers, who failed to report for examination
for the selective draft, were held in jail after being permitted
to gather their belongings, and they will be taken to Tomb

whelming majorities of both houses of
congress. When such a decision has
been made the duties and therefore
the rights of all the people of the
country immediately change. It be
comes their duty t'j s:op discussion on
the question decided and to act, to
proceed immediately to do everything
in their power to enable the governor
of their country to succeed in the war
upon which the country has entered.
Contempt Earned
"A nation which declares war and
g'jes on discussing whether it ought
to have declared war or not is impo
tent, paralysized, imbecile and earns
the contempt of mankind and the
certainty of humiliating defeat and
subjection tv foreign control. A de
mocracy which cannot accept its own
decisions, made in accordance with its
own laws but must keep on endlessly
discussing the question already decid
ed, has failed in the fundamental re
quirements of self-government.
For or Against
"But after the decision in favor of
war the only issue left for the individ
ual citizen is whether he is for or
against his country. From that time
no arguments against the war in which
Uie country in engaged are enemy arg
uments. Their spirit is the spirit of
rebellion against the government and
laws of the United States. Their ef
feet is to hinder and lessen that pop
ular support of the government in car
rying on the war which is necessary
to success. Their manifest purpose Is
to prevent aetAm by continuing dis
cussion. They encourage the enemy.
They lend to introduce delay and ir
resolution into our councils.
Traitors at Heart
"The men who are speaking and
writing and printing arguments
against the war now, and against
everything that is being done to carry
on the war, are rendering more effec
tive service to Germany than they
could render in the field with arms
in their hands. The purpose and effect
of what they are doing is so plain that
it is impossible to resist the conclu
sion that the greater part of them are
at heart traitors to the United States
and wilfully seeking to bring about
the triumph of Germany and the hu
miliation and defeat of their 'own
country."' ' .
Export to North
to Be Regulated
(Ry Review Leased Wire.)
WASHINGTON. Sept. 14. Shipment
of certain foods to Canada and New
Foundland under a ruling tonight by
the exports administrative board
hereafter will require the same form
of license demanded for their export
to other countries. Heretofore they
have gone forward under blanket
license issued by collectors of cus
toms. The purpose of the order, it was
explained, is to provide means of
closer cooperation between the Amer
ican and Canadian food aministrators
and to put the United States in posi
tion to conserve its supplies if short
ages appear likely. The foods nameo.
are wheat, wheat flour, butter and
sugar.
Shipments now in transit are ex
cepted in the order, which also makes
provision for small shipments by pro
ducers and dealers living close to the
border. Collectors of customs are dV
rected to permit shipments to go
through without license when not in
excess of the following quantities:
Wheat, 125 bushels; flour, 23 bar
rels; butter, 125 pounds; sugar, 25
barrels.
Shipments of food in the amounts
that may go to Canada without license
will be permitted to go forward to
Mexico under the same terms. Com
plaints have come to the exports board
that weekly market purchases have
been held up on the Mexican border
by zealous collectors when no export
license could be shown by the pur
chaser. SWEDE ELECTIONS.

Whiskey and Wine
Dumped Into Bay
(By Review Leased Wire)
DOUGLAS, Sept. 14. More than
five hundred carloads of whiskey and
champagne and other wines, valued at
$3,500,000, were dumped into the bay
at Guaymas, Sonora. under orders of
the state authorities on August 28 last,
according to a statement today by Ives
G. Lelevier, Mexican consul nere.
Photographs of the scenes attending
the confiscation and destruction of the
liquor, together with the official no
tification of the act, were received by
the consul this morning.
Accumulation
The beverages thrown into the
ocean were the aeVumuUlions t
shipments to Sonora se.izd by the
state since the abolition of the liquor
traffic on January 1, 1915, and the
stocks on hand which were taken over
when the prohibition decree became
effective. Every government ware
house in the state has been emptied
of liquor, it is declared, and the infor
mation to Mr. Lelevier says that, so
far as the authorities are aware, there
is not a drop of intoxicants in the
state.
Calles Determined
The message to the consul said that
P. Elias Calles, still the chief author
ity in Sonora, is determined that
liquor never again shall be sold in the
state or be permitted to come within
its borders.
HOOVER DENIES.
(By Review Leased Wire).
WASHINGTON, Sept. 14. Reports
that the government is contemplating
requisitioning wheat on the farms to
keep flour mills going were denied
tonight by Herbert Hoover, the food
administrator. Mills generally, Mr.
Hoover said, are running on full time,
although some are handicapped by
shortage of grain.
Except in limited areas where anti
war and pro-German' propaganda is
carried on there has been no disposi
tion by farmers, Mr. Hoover said, to
withhold wheat from the market.

there was a representative showing
of advances ranging from 1 to 3 points
and although these gains were scaled

was a material improvement. Total
sales 415.000 shares.

GRAIN MARKET.
CHICAGO, Sept. 14. General sell
ing of corn resulted today from as
sertions that Germany's peace terms
had been handed to the pope. The
market, which for the most part had
been advancing until the peace talk
became current, turned then sharply
downgrade. Closing quotations were
heavy, to 1V4 net lower at 11S-&
to 11874 December and II614 to 116
May. Oats finished to down.
In provisions the outcome ranged from
30 decline to a rise of 35 cents.
Except during a brief time at the
opening, corn showed decided strength
throughout the first half of the ses
sion. Initial weakness was due to
prevailing warmth and sunshine, but
"forecasts of conditions adverse to
crop progress led soon to a an out
burst of bullish sentiment which was
increased by numerous reports, that
damage from frost had been gTeater
than the trade as a rule has hereto
fore believed. It happened thus that
the market was In a position for lib
eral profit-taking by holders when
peace gossip began to circulate. The
fact thai the peace reports include
specified references tp absolute inde
pendence for Belgium tendd. further,
, to handicap the bulls.
Export purchases amounting to
$00,000 bushels failed to prevent oats
from sagging with corn in the late
trading.
Supplies of wheat gained a little
volume but not sufficiently so to over
take the demand. Active buying for
October 'lard gave the provision mar
ket a lift. The close, however, was un
settled by much profit-taking on the
part of the holders.

NEW YORK, Sept. 14. There wa
an undercurrent of firmness display
ed in the stock market today with
the steel shares inclined to exhibit
more resilency. The tenor of the
news from Russia was indicative ot
stability of provisional government
and wag the inspiring influence in
the demand for stocks today.
Indications of a rather well liqui
dated condition also induced a better
demand and it seems to be the con
census of opinion now that the mar
ket is in a position to respond read
ily to the developments interpreted In
a conservative way.
However, until the ' situation be
comes more clarified the tendency may
be rather irregular with the possibi
lities favoring gradual betterment.

Suffering Described As Torture
Reliered by Black-Draught.
Rossville, Ga. Mrs. Kate Lee Able, of
this plaae, writes; "My husband is an
engineer, and once while lifting, he in
jured himself with a piece of heavy ma
chinery, across the abdomen. He was
so sore he could not bear to press on
himself at all, on chest or abdomen. He
weighed IG5 lbs., and fell off until he
weighed 110 lbs., in two weeks.
He became constipated and it looked
like he would die. We had three different
doctors, yet with all their medicine, his
bowels failed to act : He would turn up
a ten-cent bottle of castor oil, and drink
it two or three days in succession, lie
did this yet without result We became
desperate, he suffered so. He was swol
len terribly. He told me his suffering
could only be described as torture.
I sunt and bought Thedford's Black
Draught. 1 made him take a big dose,
and when it began to act he fainted, he
was in such misery, but he got reSief and
began to mend at once. He got well,
and we both feel he owes his life to
Thedford's Black-Draught."
Thedford's Black-Draught will help you
to keep fit, ready for the day's work.

WATCHING TILL THE TAIL DIES.
This is the last round of Bisbee's fight with the I. W.
W. The serpent's back is broken; only its tall still
wiggles. When the government cut the rations at the
Columbus stockade the other day the wobblies were
seized with their - last convulsion as a body. Of the
twelve hundred that Bisbee sent there two months ago
less than-four hundred were left last week. From best
reports now obtainable this week will see the last of them
out of Columbus. Only small per cent of the deported
. men ha ve returned to Bisbee and only a small per cent
of these have" stayed here.
Right now the district is threatened with the return
of possibly one hundred or one hundred and fifty out of
the original twelve hundred deported. Pretty good show
ing when it is considered that over 1200 were sent away.
But at that this district cannot afford to relax its vigilance
for a moment.
Thursday morning thirty-four tried to come back in a
body. They were the van guard of the last remaining
remnant "Maybe we can get back in," they argued;
"maybe Bisbee is asleep at the switch." - But "maybees"
of this kind don't grow here in September. Bisbee wa?
very much awake. Captain Harry Wheeler and his dep
uties met these wobblies and promptly placed them un
der arrest. Half a hundred citizens, most of whom were
business men, also went to meet these wobblies and to
lend moral support to the alert tnd determined sheriff.
Friday morning ten more drifted in, when one hundred
were expected. But they did not come. The Thursday
news was bad. They will drift in here in lots and drib
lets of ten and twelve for the next few days. And thej
will drifj out again. Either this or they will serve a jai.
sentence at hard labor. No compromise or relaxation
here with the thugs and toughs and pickets and Intimida
tors and soapbox orators and loafers and shirkers and
traitors that compose this crowd.
Ninety per cent of those trying to get back here the
past few days are not American citizens. They cannot
get work in this camp. Therefore they cannot stay here
If they did not come here to work, why did they come?
There is plenty of work all over the country for stron;
men to do.
Recent governmental action has placed the I. W. W
beyond the pale. There are just two classes of them
now. The first are traitors and the second are vags. It
is the jail for both of them.
Warren District and Bisbee are clean of agitators and
loafers and conspirators. And the spirit of the people
here still burns bright and undimmed to keep them so
Sheriff Wheeler is on the job night and day. He still
has the active and strong support of every class of citi
zens. City officials here in Bisbee are co-operating with
the sheriff . The breakage and floatsam of the Columbus
camp that are drifting upon the whirlpool of public opin
ion will find the same determined, united, firey resistance
J.ere in Bisbee that was manifest in the memorable drive
of July 12.
This district was as intense and wide awake Thursday
and Friday mornings of this week as it was on the morn
ing of July 12. The same soft spoken, cool, courageous
competent sheriff was In command. The same do or di'
spirit of three thousand members of the Citizens and
Loyalty Leagues.
The wobblies knew it. They met it face to face and
were afraid. They moved on with the same shuffle and
shamble and srrowl.
Bisbee is fronting four ways watching for wobblies. 1'
one stays here he will stay with a pick in his hands dig
ging the roads while he serves a jail sentence.
The spirit of July 12, when danger threatened, wai
finer But "the spirit of today, that refuses to waver or
grow dim,' is finer still. Fight It out on this line If Jt
takes all summer and far into the winter, is the slogan of
the district, and it will win.
Bisbee broke the serpent's back with the deportation
stick; and Bisbee is watching still, alert and ready, and
will continue to watch until t!ie tail dits at sundown.
IDAHO SENATOR HITS FROM THE SHOULDER.
Senator James H. Brady of Idaho favors the arrest and
deportation of leaders of the I. W. W., according to a re
port made following a conference with the department
of labor.
Senator Brady was formerly governor of Idaho, which
state is now deeply interested in the I. W. W. menace, a3
continued operation of its mines depends on a quick and
entire settlement of the trouble.
Senator Brady's views are expressed in the following
report :
"Senator Brady conferred recently with the officials
in the department of labor in regard to the I. W. W. men
ace in the western states. The senator pointed out that
this menace seems to be extending and that the depart
ment of labor ought to begin immediate steps to handle
the situation in every part of the country. As the im
migration act of February 5, 1917, gives the secretary of
labor the authority, to arrest and deport any alien who is
teaching disbelief in organized government, or who be
longs to any organization such as the I. W. W. which en
tertains and teaches disbelief or opposition to organized
government. Senator Brady pointed out that there was
ample authority In the department of labor and ample
machinery to destroy the I. W. W. movement. The de
partment of labor not only has the authority to arrest,
but the decision as to whether any certain alien shall be
allowed to remain in the United States or be deported
will be determined by the bureau of immigration and not
by jury. Since it is stated that much over 50 per cent
of the membership of the I. W. W. in the United States
at the present time is composed of these aliens, would
have a very salutory effect."
THE LINGERING GUEST
'Pears like trouble's never done,
Won't be up an' gone;
Sometimes, too, can't find a one
You can blame it on!
Then it hits a feller double
When he knows he made the ti'ouble!
II.
Yit, I'm thinkin' trouble's best
Fer some folks a-livin';
Who, with all the world's joy blest.
Never give thanksgivin'"
Yit it ain't fer me to blame 'em;
It's old Trouble's task to tame 'em!
Frank L. Stanton.
THE WAR AND THE DOCTORS.
It is proper the war department should exempt bona fide
medical students from military service until they have
completed their studies. It is likely that any particular
young man will be of more use to the nation as a doctor
either at home or with the army, than he would be as a
private in the ranks or a petty officer. But along with
this exemption there should be an acknowledged right to
draft medical men whose studies are completed. Other
wise the exemption is illogical and unfair.
Doctors are seriously needed for the army. The plans
of the war department are said to call for 30,000, and ul
timately perhaps for 50,000, allowing no more than the
customary number in proportion to the number of troops.
There are 150,000 physicians in the country. They are
said not ( have volunteered in anywhere near adequate
numbers.
The government cannot safely depend on volunteering
alone, as long as there Is any doubt about filling the
complement It should have authority to commandeer
the services of whatever part of the medical profession
may be necessary.
This branch of the military service is arduous, but not
particularly dangerous. And it is a matter of life and
death to the men fighting our battles.
Missouri Democrats have started a movement to re
call Senators Stone and Read. That is the best news
that has come from Missouri since the war started.
Berlin is still selebrating the capture of Riga. Sounds
like the head of a household coming home and boasting
of having taken candy from a crippled newsboy and being
congratulated by his family.
ALLEGED IJI RIOTERS
TO BE TRIED IN
T
Brief State Notes
Governor Campbell yesterday ap
pointed as members of the board of
state medical examiner3. Dr. "Colt I.
Hushes, Dr. A. L. Gustetter and Dr.
D. L. Connor. Dr. Connor is an osteo
path and the two other allopathic
physicians. The retiring members of
the medical board are Dr. George W.
Martin of Tucson, Dr. I. E. Huffman
of Tucson and Dr. C. T. Sturgeon of
Globe. Dr. Huffman is now in the
i
army as surgeon. '
Our old friend Gen. Weyler, better known during his
Cuban campaigns as "The Butcher", has bobbed up again,
this time in command of troops sent to suppress a strike
in Spain. He Is classified by the foreign correspondents
as pro-German. That sounds perfectly natural. Wey
rer"s little ways of brutality dovetail with the Prussian
ways to a hair.
Every good American should be told, and told plainly,
that the Hearst papers in San Francisco, Chicago and
New York are preaching treason. Hearst has carried
his anti-British sentiments to a point where he is pro
German, and hence anti-American. He hires able writers
to present his poisonous doctrines, therefore he is all the
more dangerous. Those- who read and support and be
lieve his papers are his dupes and they aid him in his
campaign against the best efforts of this government to
win the war with Prussia.
With France and England, not only unbeaten, but
stronger than ever before, with separate peace with Rus
sia farther off than ever, with America preparing for a
long hard war, Germany faces a winter of despair. Her
lines still hold, it is true, but the offensive power Is gone
and they are bending back and cracking in many places.
America's millions of fine fighting men and America's
stream of food and money and munitions and airplanes
are beginning to flow towards France. At last the Prus
sian ts impressed with the magnitude and thoroughness
of this peaceful country's preparations for a big fight to
a finish. He has one la it hope to keep his spoils and his
system and his pride, and only one. That is to preach
peace. Every Prussian agent has his implicit orders. He
Is to spare neither expense, pains or truth in his cry for
peace. But It is a false cry. It rings false. The
treachery note predominates it. The only peace Prussia
wants is a Prussian peace. With more than a year f
this whine for; peace, she has never promulgated her
terms. Let every real American say it over and 'over
again, proclaim It from the housetops, pronounce it,
preach it, practice it, there can Ik no peace until th"
Prussian Is beaten on the battle fields. Only friends ami
well wishers of Germany or fools will talk peace at this
time.
T'J more chap'.ers in the history
of Gila county's toleration of rioters
and wobblies were written Thursday,
one when Justice of the Peace E. H.
McEacheron arraigned and L'ound
over for trial at Miami on charges of
rioting of 15 nore men, and another
when 54 alleged rioters appeared be
fore Superior Judge Shute, were ar-
ragned and given until 10 o'clock this
morning to plead. The law allows a
prisoner one day in which to deter
mine what his plea shall be and the
prisoners' counsel tc'ok advantage of
the opportunity to spar for time.
Under $2000 Bonds
The men who appeared before Jus
tice McEachron were a:l held under
12000 bond just louble the security
demanded in Globe to insure their ap
pearance in court Among the 15 are
several men, midely kn'own as agita
tors of the I. W. W. class.
Those who were hed for trial and
pu: under bonds are Frank Pancich,
Mike Strukum, Reese E. Skull, Jim
Tosey, Dee Crawford, Frank Allen, Ed
Ealda. George Cekovlch, Alf Cordy,
Bud Ellis, J. C. Neely, Mike and
George Abramovich, Pete Bigovich and
M. Soulages.
The men wh'j were arraigned be
fore Superior Judge Shute and given
until 10 this morning to plead were:
P. W. Gallentine, Lou Riddle, JacR

To Call Outside Judge
The men were represented by At
torney Tom Fiaunigan of the Miners'
union, who will have as associates
counsel. Sen. Worsley of Tucson, and
by Attorney Frank McCann. As each
man's name was called and he re
sp'jnded he was given a copy of the
complaint against him, all of the com
plaints being substantially the same,
and charging them with rioting on the
O. D. picket line on July 2, 3 or 4.
McCann, who represents, for the most
part, the I. W. W. element among the
prisoners, notified the t'Jurt that his
clients would individually enter de
murrers to the complaints. Judge
Shute thereupon gave notice that if
the demurrers were to be filed with a
view to proving the actual merit of
the complaints, he would decline to
p'ass upon them and call in an outside I
judge to sit in the cases.
Ready With Pleas
Flannigan. jn the other hand,' noti
fied the court that at 10 this morning
his clients would be prepared to enter
pleas of not guilty, and that they
would demand separate trials
The arraignment of the alleged riot
ers yesterday marked the opening ol
the superior court for the fall term.
There w,ere many vcfendants on hand
to face b.otlegging cnarges and they,
like the other prisoners, were given
until today to ple.id.
The state corporation commission
has consented to the issue of $1,000.
000 in bonds for the financing of the
Apache Railroad company, which is
preparing to build 71 miles southward
from Holbrook Into the Black Mesa
forest and to a large deposit of bitu
minous coal. Eventually $3,000,000
will be spent, the cost being estimated
at $45,000 a mile. Construction Is to
be started October 1 and is expected
to take about a year. The Santa Fe
Is understood to be joining in the.
project and to have some interest in
a tie-plckling plant that is to be built
at Holbrook.

The governorship question will be
before the state supreme court for
trial in about a month. Just now
Campbell's attorneys are working
through the briefted transcript sub
mitted by the appellant and already
have filed objection to its sufficiency.
The transcript is an enormous volume
of typewritten matter, covering the
testimony of a trail that consumed
several months. The Democratic side
is under charge of E. C. Struckmeyer

Carlos Gonzales, a 15-year-old youth!
brought to the city late on Monday;
night from Wenden for treatment for(
a rattlesnake bite, owes his life, if he
yet survives, to Madame Schumann
Heink. He deserved her ministratious,
for he suffered the bite while trying
to perform a service in his superstit
ious way for Mrs. Frederick Schu
mann, the daughter-in-law of the fa
mous singer.
On Monday morning, Mrs. Schu
mann, at whose home seven miles
north of Wenden, Madame Schumann
Heink was stopping, after her appear
ance at Wenden the night before, was
stung by a scorpion. The boy who
was present and had heard that the ,
poison of a rattlesnake was a famous
antidote for a scorpion sting, ran cut
in search of a snake. He found one
not far from the house an. dkilled it as
he thought. But when he stooped to
pick it up to extract the poison from
its glands, the snake struck hint on
the wrist. j
The boy flew to the house with the
story of the happening and Madame
Schumann-Henik sucked the wound
until all the poison that had not al
ready gone into circulation had been 1
extracted. The boy was then hurried
to Wenden and brought in on the late
train on Monday night.

Today, in the countless thousands of homes where gas fired water heaters are in

MAY FILL FIRST ARIZONA
According to advices received here
yesterday from Phoenix there is a
possibility that the drafted men of
Arizona will be used to fill the First
Arizona regiment. It was feared for
a time, especially since the selected
men had been sent to Camp Funston,
at Fort Riley, Kansas, and that the
First Arizona had been ordered to
Linda Vista, that the regiment would
be filled but by drafted men from
other states in nearer cantonments, so
that the regiment, though bearing the
name of the First Arizona, would be
made up in considerable part of men
who are not residents of the state.

Texas Governor
Will Testify On
His Impeachment
(By Review Leased Wire)
AUSTIN, Texas, Sept 14. The
much discussed question as to whether
Governor James E. Ferguson will tes
tify in his own defense before the sen
ate high court of impeachment, was
settled this afternoon when his chief
counsel announced that the governor
would be ready to take the stand next
Monday.
J. P. Davis, assistant private secre
tary to the governor, concluded his tes
timony late today. Mr. Hanger then
said his next witness was to be the
governor. Mr. Hanger said he would
prefer not to break the governor's tes
timony by adducing 'only a small part
of it today, so court agreed to the re
cess immediately until Monday.
Davis was on the stand all of to
day. His testimony was that he did
not know anything of the $156,600 cur
rency loans with which the governor
settled a large part of his indebted
ness this year except that $40,000 of
the money was turned over to him for
deposit in the American National bank
of Austin.
While he was on the stand a deposit
slip .was introduced showing that on
April 25. 1917. the governor himself
deposited $35,000 in currency in the
Temple State bank, where the gover
nor formerly was president.
LEFT FOR TOMBSTONE.
Quite a number of Bisbee young
men left this morning for Tombstone
where they were called for examina
tion on the fourth call of the draft
board. All those whose order num
ber reads from 3500 to 4000 inclusive
will be examined in Tombstone today.
A few of those examined today will bo
necessary to fill the quota of Cochise,
county of 677. Dr. Hunt left this
morning to be there in attendance. It
is thought that this will be the last
call made until after the Cochise coun
ty quota has been sent to Comp Fun
ston. When the board will then call
the balance on the list of 2750 for ex
amination so that they will be ready
should a second call for men be made,
or an order issued to fill up the First
Arizona infantry, as well as her por
portion of the regular army.
