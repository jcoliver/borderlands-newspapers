Long Waited Battle, Delayed
By Illness Of Brother Of
Villa, Set For Dawn Today
General Angeles In Supreme
Command Of 4,400 Men;
Federals Number But 1 ,000
JUAREZ, Mexico, June 13. A
skirmish occurred between feder
als and advanced forces of Gen
eral' Angeles at 4:30 o'clock this
afternoon. Several troopers were
killed on the federal side.
EL PASO, June 13. A courier who
arrived tonight from the rebel head
quarters near Zaragosa, less than ten
miles from Juarez, reports that the
rebels have 4400 men, all armed with
rifles and each man supplied with 300
rounds of ammunition. Two field guns
and eight machine guns are included
in the rebel fighting equipment.
At the time the courier left the camp
the intention was to attack Juarez be
fore daylight tomorrow morning. The
courier, who is well known here, a re
liable man., though a strong partisan of
Villa, declares there is not the slight
est doubt of the ability of the rebels
to capture Juarez.
Villa Second in Command
Angeles Is in supreme command of
the expedition, though Francisco Villa,
with a body guard of 300 men, is pres
ent in person.
The force is divided as follows:
The Brigade 'Pablo Lopez, under
command of fiartin Lopez.
The Brigade Jose Rodriguez, former
ly commanded by Hipolito Villa, undef
General Michel.
I Hipolito Villa is at Villa Ahumada
suffering from cerebral congestion and
iri a serious condition. He is attended
by a bodyguard of 400 men.
According to the courier Angeles
has absolute information as to the
number of men in the Juarez garrison
which he claims is less than 1000,
though the federals claim 2500.
Says Federal Force Under 1000
The rebel estimate of the Juarez
force follows:
Six hundred and eighty men of the
original garrison; 90 from Villa Ahu
mada; 30 from 1 Moctezuma and 130
from Casa Grandes.
This information was obtained from
two women spies captured at Villa
Ahumada. One- of these women was
brought north and sent into the fed
eral lines with a message urging the
garrison to come out and fight and
avoid shedding blood of non-combatants
in the city.
The courier also brought a report
of the destruction of the Mexican Cen
tral railway line by the rebels includ
ing the drawing and burning of 78,000
railway ties between Moctezuma and
Chihuahua City and the similar de
struction of 35,000 ties between Chi
huahua City and Santa Rosalia, to the
south.
Brother's Illness Delayed Attack
.' The delay in attacking Juarez is ac
counted for by the-statement that Gen
eral Angeles was awaiting the arrival
of Villa, who was delayed on account
of remaining behind to arrange for
medical aid for his. brother.
Fifteen men of Martin Lopez's com
mand were sent in close to the Juarez
defenses on the east late today and
brought in a report of a skirmish with

CONSUL DEPRECATES
SIZE OF VILLA ARMY
EL PASO, June 14 Shortly after
midnight Consul General Andres G.
Garcia issued a statement in which
he said the number of troops claimed
by the rebels was vastly exaggerated.
The consul geaeral said the Villa
forces did not exceed 1600 men and
that he had information direct from
the camp to the effect that Villa has
not joined the main body of his forces.
"If the rebels attack, we are prepared
to give them a hot reception," the con
sul general added.
At midnight Juarez was quiet and
there had been no shooting.

FELIPE ANGELES, Mexico, June 13.
(By the Associated Press..) General
Felipe Angeles, commanding the
forces against the Carranza govern
ment in northern Mexico, granted a
four-hour interview to a correspondent
of the Associated Press at Zaragosa-
Tanned and sunburned from many
days in the open since he crossed the
International boundary line last De
cember to join with Francisco Villa,
General Felipe Angeles was found in
the best of health and spirits. He is
all confidence, likewise his men,
about the outcome of their cause.
Martin Lopez With Angeles
With General Angeles at his head
quarters, situated 12 miles southeast
of Juarez, is, Martin Lopez, his next
in command; Ramon Vega, and Gen
eral Holguin.
The forces of General Angeles are
the most surprising ofall. These men,
not boys or old men, are big and
strong. Some of his men are carrying
not only their full side arms, but have
extra rifles.
On of his chief lieutenants,.. when
asked about Juarez said:
"We can take Juarez in three
hours."
The confidence of the men is as great
as that of their leader.
When General Angeles was asked
what he intended to do about Juarez,
he said:
"I do not know whether to take the
city or not- If I told you, that would
be military information and of course,
I have nothing further to say about
Juarez."

FORT WAYNE. Ind., June 13. Will
H. Hays, chairman of the national

an address here tonight rejected the
challenge of Homer S. Cummings,

that the Republicans make a partisan
issue of the League of Nations. He
said:
"The conclusion of the treaty of
peace, including all its provisions
when we know what they are is in no
sense a pSttisan question. It is an
American question. In the same spirit
in which Republicans during the re
cent war measured their every act by
how they could contribute most to ef
fective war action, so now they are
determined to n)eet this new phase of
the war problem in that revived spirit
of fervent Amtilcsnism which is the

SENATE TO BACK
TREATY IS CLAIM
8 G. O. P., With Democrats,
Enough To Vote Down
Knox Resolution
WASHINGTON, June 13. Senate
leaders drew their lines more sharp
ly today for the next phase of the
treaty fight, to begin early next week
around the resolution of Senator
Knox, Republican of Pennsylvania,
proposing to put the tenate on rec
ord against accepting the league of
nations as now interwoven with the
terms of peace.
After a series of conferences " and
much informal counting of votes there
were various predictions as to the
course the struggle would take. Both
sides were optimistic, but were pre
dicting a long and stormy debate.
Whether opponents of the resolution
should carry their fight to the point of
parliamentary obstruction so as to pre
vent a vote until after signing of the
treaty at Versailles was discussed at
a conference of Democrats, attended
by Senator Hitchcock of Nebraska and
several other members of the foreign
relations committee. Afterward the
senators present gave conflicting
views as to the method of procedure
but agreed that it might be shaped
largely by developments.
No Filibuster, Says Hitchcock
Senator Hitchcock said no filibuster
would be resorted to and that there
would be no serious opposition to
bringing the measure to a vote. He
predicted that every Democrat except
Se'nator Reed of Missouri, would be
against it and that they would be Join
ed by about eight Republicans, giving
a safe majority to vote it down.
Other senators at the conference
made clear their intention to fight the
resolution at every step.
Supporters of the measure have con
tended that if more than one-third ot
the senate membership goes on record J
in its favor, tne result win ne a warn
ing that the treaty as framed cannot
secure the necessary two-thirds when
presented for ratification. If a vote be
blocked, it would be no surprise if an
effort were made to accomplish this
purpose through a round robin.
The first fight over the resolution
is expected to center about the sec
tion stricken out in committee which
would have declared it a policy of the
American government that it should
co-operate in removing any future
menace to the peace of Europe.
Would Weaken Resolution ,
Senator Fall, Republican of ' New
Mexico, cast the deciding vote on this
question in committee but reserved
the right to support the provision in
the senate. Opponents of the resolu
tion are expected to favor the section's
restoration with the hope of weaken
ing the resolution.
The measure's supporters, however,
predict that the European section will
not be restored. Even if it were, they
say, the resolution, because of its oth
er features, still would have the sup
port of Senators Borah, Republican of
'Idaho, and Johnson, Republican of
California, who led the fight to amena

opposed to any participation in Euro

committee has completed the
work of framing the letter cover
ing the reply to the German coun
ter proposals. It recalls that the
j principles upon which the treaty
is based are such as to preclude
the allies from making fundamen
tat concessions.

the government will not particl
pate in a blockade against Ger
many in the event of the refusal
of Germany to sign the peace
treaty.
PEACE MEET SUMMARY
(By the Associated Press.)
The council of four devoted both its
sessions Friday to revision of the text
of the peace treaty, preparatory to its
presentation to the German peace dele
gation. Premier Orlando ot Italy, was
not present, having left for Rome
Thursday night to discuss at a secret
meeting of the Italian parliament the
work of peace conference and to reach
a decision on some important matters.
Baron Sonnino. the foreign minister,
represented Italy at Friday's meetings.
The rewriting of the treaty ot peace,
as announced in Paris dispatches, was
rendered necessary by the discovery
of errors and inconsistencies in the
draft as at first presented to the Ger
mans. Some of the changes to be made
are of a highly important nature, but
most of them are of a minor char
acter. Reparations Unchanged
The latter is particularly true of the
reparations clauses, which will be vir
tually unchanged in the new draft. But
the financial provisions will be amend
ed so that the reparations commission
will be given discretion to allow Ger
many to gather a working capital for
the resumption of war industries in or
der that Bhe may meet the require
ments of the allies.
The plebiscite in Silesia and
changes in the Polish frontier neces
sitates new clauses, while a revised
draft of the provisions on the Danish
frontiers is expected.
Holland has Joined Switzerland.
Norway and Sweden and Denmark in
refusing to take part in a blockade
against Germany should the latter re
fuse to sign the peace treaty.

AJO, Ariz.. June 13. Col. John C.
Greenway, general manager of the
New Cornelia Copper company. Is
about to realize the greatest- dream
of hia life.
Col. Greenway, who is in the east,
is said to haveN raised $12,000,000 to
build a railroad from Ajo to the gulf
and one from Ajo to Tucson, which
will give all of the miners of Arizona
an outlet to tidewater.
After Col. Greenway built the
great plant at Ajo "and made such a
huge success of what some consid
ered a doubtful experiment, he an
nounced that he had one further am
bition, which was to build a railroad
from southern Arizona to the Gulf of.
Calofirnia and establish a great port
there.
His dream seems about to be real
ized. The surveying party which Is
locating the right of way is nearing
the Mexican border; the company
has the necessary concessions and
Col. Greenway is finding no difficulty j
in financing his. proposition.
Because- of his nation-wide reputa
tion as ah engineer, his ability for ex
ecuticn and his high integrity, Col
Greenway is said to have at his dis-:

The increase of the cost of trans-1

Since the . armistice was signed,
plans for the construction of the
Tucson, Phoenix & Tidewater and the
Verde Valley railroads have been
held up. pending a drop In steel, but
it Is learned that the Phelps Dodge
interests, who are behind the Tucson
phoenix & Tidewater, and James S.
Douglas, who is behind the Verde
Valley, have concluded that steel is
not scheduled to take a further drop
and are going ahead with their plans
for the consideration of these roads.
The survey of the Tucson, Phoenix &
Tidewater runs from Tucson to a
point about 15 miles west of Flor-
ence, where it crosses the una ana
follows the north bank to Chandler,
an(j on to Mesa and Phoenix, where
the terminal facilities have been se-
cured. At Mesa, it will connect wri:

2000 men. at Nogajes, Sonora, which
they cannot move."
At this point the general stopped
for a moment in hi interview and
there was a- mischievous twinkle
around his eyes, for General Angeles
cannot talk) very long without his
humorous side appearing in hi-smjle.
"And, general, was it not for the
best, that those 2000 men at Nogales
were not permitted to move through
American territory?"
In answering, he said:
"Well, there was only one Amer
ican in Parral when I took the city.
He is still there and in good health.
Camp Followers Absent
"I have plenty of money and look
around at my men, are they not good
ones? We pay for everything we get;
we are not robbing anybody, the ranch
folk in the valley are getting paid for
everything we obtain."
There Is one conspicuous factor, or
one conspicuous "absent" factor at
General Angeles' headquarters and
the usual camp followers which
have always heretofore accompanied
the armies of the revolution.
When asked regarding General yilla
iGeueral Angeles said:
"He is very well.
nd how is that old wound in his
knee, general?" he was asked
General Angeles laughed and said:
Claims Villa Never Wounded
"The fact of the matter is that Gen
eral Villa never had such a wound.
When General Pershing was in Mex
ico after him, it was told over and
over of how General Villa was wound
ed in the knee and how his men car
Tied him,' drove him in an old coach
and how a physician, alleged to have
been captured by General Villa, ws
told he must either save the leg or
die. That is all nonsense. General
Villa never received any wound after
the Columbus raid. The general's legs
are like they always were, perfectly
all right."
"And General Angeles
can I tell
them over the Associated Press wires
tonight that you are here and that
; Generals Holsuin, Ramon Vega and
' Martin Lopez are also with you at
'our headquarters?'
Yes." the general answered. "You
can say that I am here; that is all
j I wqnt to say now about military af
. fairs."
I Speaking of Martin Lopez, the gen
eral said: .
Whitewash for Martin Lopez
"Martin is a youngster, well edu
cated and the most humiliating thing
to I1U! is the fa(.t that hc iias been
narKed like Gt!Ueral Villa, with
crilnes an(1 depredations he never had

COMMENCEMENT OF
LORETTO ACADEMY IS
ATTENDED BY MANY
St. Patrick's hall was filled to ca
pacity last evening when the com
mencement exercises of Loretto acad
emy were held. Four students were
graduated from the high school and
nineteen received, diplomas signify
ing that they had completed the work
of the grammar school. The diplo
mas were awarded by the Rev. C.
Mandin, rector of St. Patrick's ca
thedral. From the opening chorus, which
was sung by the members of the vo
cal class, to the last number on the
program, the work of the students
was exceptionally well done. Partic
ularly interesting were the piano and
violin numbers presented by the ad
vanced pupils. A group for violin,
interpreted by John Downs, was most
enjoyable. Madeline Hankins at the
piano gave excellent support. The
valedictory was given by Edward Ray
mond Kelly and the salutatory by
Freda Elizabeth Suttey.

TERRIBLY SWOLLEN
Sufferinz Described At Tortort
Reliered by Black-Draught. ' !
Rossville, Ga. Mrs. Kate Lee Able, of :
Bus plane, writes: "My husband is an
engineer, and once while lifting, he In
lured himself with a piece of heavy ma
chinery, across the abdomen. He was
so sore he could not bear to press on
himself at all, on chest or abdomen. He
weighed 165 lbs., and feU off until he
weighed 110 lbs., in two weeks.
He became constipated and it looked
like he would die. We had three different
doctors, yet with all their mtdicine, his
bowels failed to act. '.He would turn up
a ten-cent bottle of castor oil, and drink
It two or three days In succession. Hi
did this yet without result We became
desperate, he suffered so. He was swol
len terribly. He told me his suffering
could only be described as torture.
I sent and bought Thedford's Black
Draught. I made him take a big dose,
and when it began to act he fainted, he
was in such misery, but he got relief and
began to mend at once. He got well,
and we both feel he owes his life to
Thedford's Black-Draught."

12 Wonderful Ingredients
Like all new enterprises Flaxolyn lgan
small. But it grew astonishingly when
people learned through druggists and the
newspapers about its 12 wonderful ingre
dients which simply make over the human
system.
Sales grew so rapidly that in February
we were tens of thousands of packages
oversold. Shipments to druggists were
weeks late. Customers were disappointed.
But early in March Flaxolyn entered a
fine, big factory with an enormous capacity.
So now the demand can again besupplied.
Flaxolyn does not benefit simply one
body organ. It corrects and builds up ihe
whole system nerves, stomach, kidneys,
bladder, liver, lungs, small intestines and
colon. After three doses you probably will
feel the improvement. After a month you
will begin to feel like adifferent human being.
Note that Tlaxolyn docs not contain a
whit of anything harmful. Prohibition will
not affect Flaxolyn, for it contains no alcohol.

Lowell, Ariz., April 20, 1919. "For about 15 months I have been trying
everything that is on the market for eczema, with very little benefit. Final
ly one of ray friends advised me to try Number 40, which I did. I have now
used nine bottles and am sure It has done me lots of good and in time
think it will cure the disease, which is deep seated, and may take from 12
to 18 months to eradicate. I have great faith in Number 40 and am going
to stay by it. I do not hesitate to recommend it to any of my friends. I
know of two men working with me who are now taking it with splendid
results." Yours very truly, George N cholson; Witness to Signature. George

MONTHLY PREMIUMS
ARE ADDED BY U. S.
TO WHEAT GUARANTEE
NEW YORK. June 13. To preserve
a natural flow of wheat from the
farm, periodical premium-covering
storage charges will be added to the
basic price at various guarantee mar
kets, according to an announcement
here tonight by Julius II. Barnes,
United States wneal director.
These premiums will not be intro
duced during July, when the basic
prices prevailing for the last year
will remain in effect. ' For each suc
ceeding month, jhewever, premiums
will be announced thirty days in ad
vance. ' a
Mr. Barnes also announced railroad
rates from inter-mountain and Pacific
coast territory to Galveston and New
York will be reduced to 56 ecnts per
hundred, the equivalent of 33.6 cents
per bushel. Tbia reduction, Mr.
Barnes explained, is intended as a re
lief to the producers in those sec
tions as the grain corporation cannot
pursue its' practice of making effect
ive a $2 blanket minimum price or
all wheat at inter-mountain points,
but will be obliged to confine itself
to paying $2 at Pocatello, Great Falls
and Salt Lake City, leaving the rest
of the western territory to base on !
the commercial market moat readily
reached by it.
To assure a larger flow of. wheat
to the Gulf ports, Mr. Barnes said he
had decided to seek an executive or
der increasing the Numbep One base
price at New Orleans and Galveston
from $2.20 to $2.30 per, bushel. He
added he expected this change would
become effective July 1.

ident Wilson by the Northwestern
Conference of Farmers here today.
Resolutions adopted included one

JAPAN GRASPING AT
MASTERY OF TRADE
IN EASTERN PACIFIC
SYDNEY. June 13-Japan has made
great strides in developing her trade
with Java since the beginning of the
war and i3 now extending her com
mercial advantages there, says R. Dry
ver, or Sourabay, Java, an expert upon
far eastern affairs.
"The cutting off of European sup
plies by the war," said Mr. Drvver.
"forced Java to rely upon Japanese
and Australian markets and these
trade routes will not now suffer from
the resumption of European activities.
To my mind the east should be inde
pendent of the west in trade. Japan
ese concentration in the Pacific puts in
strong light her ambition to secure
commercial mastery in eastern wa
ters." Mr. Dryver recently was commis
sioned by the Dutch government to in
vestigate the government of the
Philippine islands with a view to dob.
sible changes in the government of
Java which would affect 40,000,000
Javanese. He will recommend a num
ber of changes but, said it would not
be an easy matter to treat the Jav
anese as the Filipinos were being
treated because there was a marked
difference in intelligence between the
two racs. This was in favor of the
Filipinos.

WILLARD TO MEET
DEMPSEY'S RUSHES
IN A 20-FOOT RING
TOLEDO, June 13. Jess Willard
and Jack Dempsey will meet in their
world's heav5"weight championship
contest here July 4 in a twenty foot
ring instead of the regulation 24 foot
enclosure, it was announced by Tex
Rickard, promotor, tonight, after he
had obtained the consent of both men.
Rickard said that reducing the size of
the ring will enable him to save 400
square feet at the ringside to install
additional press senate, the demand
for which has exceeded all expecta
tions. ' You can make it fifteen feet square
fcr all I care." was Depmsey's reply
to Rickard's proposal.
When Willard heard of the chal
lenger's remarks he said:
"It does not make any difference
to me what size you make the ring.
The smaller it is the harder it will be
for Dempsey to get away from me."

Mrs. Mary Goose and Riley
"Will the poetry of James Whitcomb Riley live?"
A Kansas City newspaper asks this question, and it is an interesting
one too; for it involves all literary appeal in the matter of popularity
and duration. Only Riley's child verse will live.
His poems intended for the mature mind will not live.
This last classification of his work, for the most part, is of rural life,
and while it has a refined, artistic and healthful appeal to "fond recol
lections," yet most of us of any rural recollections at all, fond or other
wise, are fast passing.
Most of us today are of city birth and rearing, and will be in increas
ing numbers in generations to come.
And then again rural life is changing the telephone, the gas power
engine, the automobile, the truck and tractor has put another phase upon
it from the time of which Riley sung.
All these appliances are having a tendency to make the city man
and farmer one people, and in another generation or two neither will
know much of the rural life now.
The reason Riley's Child verse will live is that all children are alike
in the sense that up to a certain age they are not affected by time or
conditions. -
Any verse or song that appeals to one generation of children will ap
peal to all generations of children of about the same age.
The children of today are just like their grandparents at the
same age.
Children are absolutely natural end that is the reason, by the way,
that we like them. ...
And somebody said that the reason children were natural was that
they were sure of dinner.
There are numberless examples of the fact that what appeals to one
generation of children will appeal to all generations, but the best is per
haps the- verse of Mrs. Mary Goose who lived in Boston in the early part
of the 17th century and who is now commonly known as Mother Goose.
It seems that she entertained her grandchildren by improvised vers
es; that her son-in-law, a printer and publisher, saw that what would ap
peal to his children would appeal to other children that children were
all alike and he brought them out in hook form.
And he was right even unto this generation and all generations.
Goat Getting
Tho milk cow with her luxurious tastes lias about secured the col
lective goats of the American housewife, and the houswife is now re
versing the process and securing the nanny of the dairymen hy adopt
ing a sure enough goat.
Five milk goats give as much milk as a big cow, and their feed costs
a third as much.
Goat's milk is nearly all cream, cheese made from it sells for $1 a
pound, and more demand than cheese.
No better butter Is made than that from goat's milk.
A goat is a cow wrapped up in hand size package.
Almost any suburban family can pasture a goat; few can maintain
a cow. '
The goat gives about the quantity of milk needed by the average
family, and its feed problem will never harass the family purse.
' Likewise the milk of the goat is the ideal food for babies, and many
a child that can be nourished on no other food is saved by goat's milk.
As an Indication that the housewives are discovering some of those
things e note that a Washington state milk goat breeder recently
shipped three cars of goats to Portland, Ore., the heart of the ' great
dairy county, and sold the three cars to the women of the city in two
days. Even auto tourists find the goat a convenience. Anchor Mrs.
Goat ia her pen on the trailer, and carry your fresh milk right along
with you.
But dad's worn out galluses and ma's antique corsets are not con
sidered the best maintenance ration for the modetn milk goat. A goat
will eat anything, if it must, hut rich food pays in a goat's system as in.
a cow's.
The good old argument against goat's milk because of its odor and
strong flavor came entirely from the crush, weeds and can heaps the
goat browsed from. A goat is a genius all right, but even a genius needs
something more than an empty catsup bottle to build a quart of cream on.
Reversing Advertising
- What -a 6trange appearance the newspapers would present if you
and I "were compelled to advertise our money just as merchants now
feature their merchandise.
For Instance, this might be one of the ads:
"I have come money saved up I want to spend. It is guaranteed by
the government! I solicit your merchandise in change for my money.
I will give you as much money for your merchandise as any other per
son; will furnish you a pocketbook to carry it in or will deliver it if de
'sired. Try me. See my money before letting someone else have your
merchandise."
If such were the way of doing business, merchants would have to
employ "readers" of the papers and men to follow up the ads. The cost
of doing business would be bundreds of times what It is now.
The Rhenish -people wish peace "based on a reconciliation of all
peopleH." Peoples may eventually be reconciled to the inevitable. They
will never bo7 reconciled to one another.
We try to force our ideals on Europe without proper regard for
the fact that the man who owns a 200-acre farm can afford to use
better machinery than the fellow who gets his living from a garden patch.
I'utting up a front isn't necessary after one arrives at the front.
The reason that the average woman isn't as happy as the average
man Is because she pays more attention to what the neighbors say.
His manners and clothes are better, but under the skin man is
much the same creature Ire was before he learned to cook his food.
Every father knows that a weed is more hardy than a cultivated
plant because .it has to make its own way without petting, and yet he
shields his son from hardship and calls it love.
Doubtlebb you have uoticcd that an educated man is one who kuows
something of dead languages and very little about his own.

PHOENIX ELECTION ON WATER
BONDS SET FOR JULY 19
PHOENIX, June 13. "Better water
for a Digger Phoenix," is a slogan to
which the city commission gave force
yesterday when it passed an emerg
ency ordinance calling an election
on July 19 on a proposition to vote
bonds in the sura of $1,300,000 for the
installation of a water supply, not only
to meet the growing needs of the
Phoenix of today, but to provide the
Phoenix of the future.
The question of introducing a grav
ity water system has been under dis
cussion for some years and after the
most painstaking inquiry the commis
sion reached the conclusion that the
Verde project was not only the best,
but a most ideal one.
The bonds will bear interest at the
rate of 4 1-2 per cent and will mature
in 40 years, but will be payable at the
end of 20 years when the city may
take them up at the rate of $65,000
a year.
With this as the paramount issue,
the commission has undertaken the
greatest public improvement ever con
templated in this city the construc
tion of a gravity supply of pure water
for Phoenix from the Verde river at a
joint about 33 miles from the city.
The commission is convinced after
years of study that the construction of
such a water system is an absolute
necessity to guarantee future needs,
both physical and commercial.
That the finest supply of pure water
for personal consumption and commer
cial purposes to be found anywhere in
the United States is available for this
city is the substance of reports from
leading consulting and analytical
chemists who have conducted exhaus
tive research into this phase or the
situation.
PLAN NEW LI8RARY
PHOENIX. June 13. If the commis
sion of state institutions will give
State Librarian Cronin the room he
needs in the new wing of the capitol
building, he will establish a library
there of which Arizona will be proud.
Mr. Cronin in the last two or three
years has visited the chief state lib
raries of the country and he has long
had in mind all the improvements he
would like to make upon those he has
seen.
There arc not only the law books to
be taken care of and to be arranged
with reference to the convenience of
those desiring to consult them, but
there ought to bo a place for the filing
of departmental publications of all the
states, which is regarded as a neces
sary adjunct to any up-to-date library.
CULTIVATED LANDS IN

niOENIX. Juni; 13 The area of
land under "cultivation in iIaricppa-(
couuty has increased ' practically ;100.
000 acres since 1914. aud -prospects are
very flattering for the addition of 75,

the Phoenix chamber of commerce.
The cultivated land now under irri
gation, as tuou by the report, totals
an acreage of 290,500. The Gillespie J
project on the Gila river, work on
which already has started, will add
75,000 acres, to the present acreage.
Those who are in close touch with the
situation predict that with the exten
sion of the present and other projects
a total of 400,000 acres will be reached
within the next two years.
It is interesting to note that the
area equals that of the lands under ir
rigation and cultivation in southern
California south of the Tehachapi, ex
cluding the region within the Imperial
valley.
The following table shows the vari
ous projects and the acreage now un

POWER PLANT RE-OPENS
WITH NEW EMPLOYES
PHOENIX, June 13. Operations at
the Roosevelt dam power plant, the
only one of four plants operated by
the water users' association affected
by the walkout of electrical workers
last Saturday, was resumed yesterday
morning. An entire new force of em
ployes is In charge.
By last evening, conditions had
again resumed normal in all sections
of the valley. Sufficient power was be
ing supplied for all purposes, and the
emergency steam plant of the Pacific
Gas & Electric company, pushed into
operation last Sunday, was shut down.
Likewise, sufficient water was being
propelled over the spillways by the
great water wheels to supply every de
mand of farmers. For the 'past three
days, ranchers have been securing
only about 80 per cent of tho normal
supply. Activities Ht thf Roosevelt
plant were resumed, in planty of time
to prevent crop damage it; is helicved.
' hViUUhc i-Woain'K of -trfc Uoosvvelt
plant, the strike incident has been
closed insofar as the water users are
concerned. The 17 striking employes
have all been discharged and new
operators secured to take their places.
Guards still arc being maintained at
all four plants. Officials of the asso
ciatiou declined to state the number
of guards eugaged, other than to say
that "a sufficient number" were sta
tioned at the different plants.
All plants have been closed to visit
ors as an additional precautionary
feature, it was announced yesterday.
This precaution will remain effective
for an indefinite period.
"So far, the association has had no
grievances whatsoever with any of its
employes, present ov past," eaid one
official yesterday afternoon. "De
mands have been made on us only by
outside people, people whom we refuse
to recognize or have anything to do
with."
MORMON TEMPLE AT MESA
IS FIRST OUTSIDE OF UTAH
MESA, June 13. The news to the
effect that the authorities at the gen
eral conference of the church of Latter
Day Saints, just closed at Salt Lake
City, had approved the proposition to
build a temple- of that faith in the
town of Mesa, was read with a decided
interest by the people of this commun
ity. President J. V. Lesueur, who lias
just returned from the conference, was
asked concerning the temple, its ad
vantages, etc., and in answer gave the
following interesting information re
garding edifices of this character over
the country:
There are four temples in Utah, and
none elsewhere in the United States.
A temple to cost $150,000 is now being
erected in Hawaii, and one costing
$600,000 in Canada. Marble for this
latter building is being hauled a -distance
of 250 miles, and wheri com
pleted the Canadian temple will be a
marvel of beauty. Of the four build
ings in Utah, the cost price ranges
from several hundred thousand to $5.
000,000, the last figure being the cost
of the magnificent Mormon temple in
Salt Lake City.
Mr. Lesueur states that the central
church authorities will mate dollar
for dollar any amount raised for the
building of the temple at Mesa. The
start is made with $100,000, and the
members here and elsewhere in Ari
zona and probably other portions of
the southwest will be called upon by
the finance committees to raise a like
amount. Should the membership suc
ceed in raising $200,000, a similar sum
would be appropriated by the general
church.

STOCKS AND BONDS
NEW YORK, June 13. This a day
of severe liquidation on the stock ex
change with trading influenced by the
money situation. Declines registered
early in the session were extended
when the final hour, the interest rates
on both mixed and industrial collateral
rose to 12 per cent, a new high record
for the year. This advance, illustra
tive of restriction of funds for stock
market purposes, reflected the neces
sity which has arisen for making
money supplies available in other di
rections. The situation was not one to encour
age pool interests to support the spe
cial stocks which were foremost on
the rise of last week. Shares of vir
tually all groups were unloaded freely
under the activities of the bear fac
tion, the occasional short covering not
being sufficiently important to check
the decline except during momentary
periods.
Prices for the motor shares dropped
1 to 12 points, oils 1 to 8, shippings 2
to 51,. and rails 1 to 2. United
States common declined 2 to 105
and other steels from 2 to 3
