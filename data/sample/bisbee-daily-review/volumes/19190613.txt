the feeling is intense.
Advance forces of General Angeles
were reported in skirmishes with
Mexican federals at 1 o'clock along
the Mexican side of the Rio Grande.
Through the courtesy and kindness

sociates the support set forth in their
original letter.

RADICAL GOVERNMENT
GERMANS' ONLY HOPE
PARIS, June 22. (By the Associat
ed Press.) The attitude of the Ger
man delegation on the signing of the
treaty is not clear, because the dele
gates as yet are unaware of the exact
nature of the instrument they are
called upon to ratisfy, owing to the
conflicting earlier reports on the ex
tent of the. modifications accorded
them.
The French believe that neither the
present delegation nor the present
government will sign, but they look
lor the immediate installation or a
radical socialist administration which
wm accept me ireaiy.

Union Officials Now Claim
General Tieup By Monday;
A. F. L. Backs Phone Strike
CHICAGO, June 12. Despite claims
of union officials that 18,000 telegraph
operators were idle today and that the
tie-up would be complete by Monday,
commercial telegraph business, partic
ularly between the larger cities, is be
ing handled on, practically a normal
basis, according to reports to the com
mercial companies here today.
Officers of the Commercial Tele-
I graphers' Union - of America, which
, called the strike to enforce demands
ithat the workers, be permitted to or
J ganize, "bargain collectively and ob
i tain adequate wages," were elated
over an announcement from St. Louis
that unionailrpad telegraphers were
ordered to discf nt'nue handling com
mercial business after 6 a. m. Satur-'
day. The order was issued by E. J.
Manion. president of the Order of Rail
road Telegraphers and affects 80,000
operators, it was stated.
Whether the railroad operators will
be called out on sympathetic strike
will depend upon developments of the
next few days, it was stated.
A. F. L. Backs Strike
The strike leaders gained further i
confidence through adoption by the '
American Federation of Labor or a i
resolution pledging moral support to1
the strike called for June 16 by the
International Brotherhood of Electri
cal Workers. The union men claim
the brotherhood has a membership of
more than 100,000, which includes the
bulk of the union telephone operators
throughout the country. Charles Ford,
secretary of the brotherhood, denied
reports that some of the members al
ready had walked out in sympathy
with the striking telegraphers.

FIGHT ON LEAGUE
SET FOR MONDAY
WASHINGTON, June 12. The reso
lution of Senator Knox of Pennsyl
vania, a former Republican secretary
of state, to have the senate declare
definitely it cannot accept the league
of nations interwoven with the peace
treaty, was put on the calendar of the
senate today for consideration early
next week. .
In' reporting the measure the foreign
relations committee amended it, how
ever, to strike out the section which
would have declared it a policy of the
American government to co-operate in
combatting any future menace to the
peace of Europe. The provision was
eliminated by friends of the resolu
tion after it became apparent that oth
er wise favorable committee action on
the measure might be endangered.
On the motion to amend, as well as
on the final vote for a favorable re
port, all the Democratic members
voted in the negative and in each case
they were joined by Senator McCum
ber, Republican of North Dakota, a
league supporter. On final approval
the vote stood eight to seven.
Two unsuccessful motions to post
pone action by the committee until
next week were made by Senator Pitt
man, Democrat of Nevada, and when
Senator Knox later asked unanimous
consent to present the favorable re
port to the senate, the request at first
was blocked by Senator Robinson,

JAPS ADMITTED TO
"Big Four" Now "Big Five;'
Presentation of Treaty
To Huns Delayed
PARIS, June 12. (By the Associat
ed Press.) A complete accord has
been reached in principle on all ques
tions connected with the reply to the
German counter proposals. This state
ment was made in responsible quar
ters tonight.
French and American peace confer
en.ecircles) &re ; highly- gratified at
this favorable, turn alter the prolonged
differences' of the past fortnight, verg
ing on a deadlock. The accord in
cludes the Silesian question, the pro
posed admission of Germany to the
League of Nations, and reparations
which were the chief subject of dif
ferences among the delegates.
The agreement in principle leaves
only the details and drafting, which
it is said, could be accomplished by
Friday night, though the expectation
is that actual delivery of the docu
ment to the Germans will not take
place before Saturday night.
The agreement concerning the ad
mission of Germany to the League oi
Nations is the same as drawn by Lord
Cecil and Colonel House., with the
omission of the fourth condition, re
quiring Germany to abandon compul
sory military service. M. Clemenceau,
president of the conference, contested
this condition as likely to precipitate
the same question in France and the
council finally dropped it. No time
has been fixed for Germany's en
trance, but if she conforms to the con-1
ditions,' it is expected that she will
be represented at the first meeting of
the assembly,
about 25,000 words.
Baron Makino, Japanese delegate,
today joined President Wilson and
Premiers Lloyd George, Clemenceau
and Orlando and the council, known
as the "Big Four," will hereafter be
styled the "Big Five."
The decision adding Baron Makino
to the council is explained by the fact
that his government might be given
an opportunity to full concurrence, if
full adherence is expected. His en
try into the council meeting today
necessitated rearrangement of the en
tire reply, article hy article. .
The conditions for the admission of
Germany to the League of Nations,
embodied in the report of Lord Cecil
and Colonel House, are:
First Establishment of a stable
government.
Second Signing of the treaty of
peace.
Third Loyal execution of the peace
treaty.

PARIS, J une 1 2. Marshal Foch and General Weygand
had two conferences yesterday with Premier Clemenceau at
which they discussed the question of an immediate resump
tion of hostilities and a concerted advance by the allies, says
Marechal Hutin in the Echo de Paris. N
The general opinion is, the writer adds, that Count von
Brockdorff-Rantzau has committed himself too far to be able
to sign the treaty. It also is believed that the Scheidemann
-riinistry will be swept away to make room for a ministry of
moderate Independent Socialists which will be joined by
Mathias Erzberger, chairman of the German armistice com
mission. This ministry, it is declared, would be disposed to
accept the allied conditions, which it probably would seek to

HUNS RESCUING WAR SUPPLIES

villages east of the zone have been postponed so that the boys can have
ample time to escape internment. The city of Duisberg has paid its em
oloyts until October. The great industries and banks and other business
houses have takfh all necessary measures.
"The aviation school at Paderborn has moved to Gotha, the large train

musical) purposes, was disclosed yesf
terday, ..when, a . letter outling the

sponsible to one man at the head t)f
the organization. The director 'will

U. S. TO RETAIN FUEL
CONTROL AFTER WAR
. - 0
SEATTLE, June 12. A plan has
been worked out by the federal fuel
administrator to "administer fuel"
after peace is declared, which has the
approval of President Wilson, accord
ing to a statement issued tonight by
Dr. Harry A. 'Garfield, fuel adminis
trator. The statement was Issued through
the office of David Whitcomb, former
executive secretary of the fuel admin
istration, upon the return today of
Mr. Whitcomb, with Dr. and Mrs. Gar
field from a trip to Rainier National
park.
The statement follows:
"With the actual coming of peace
the federal fuel administration ceases
to exist. I hope, however, that there
will be a plan, not to continue the fuel
administration, but to continue to ad
minister fuel part of a general plan
under which the government shall
continue something of that intimate
relation with industry which was ere
ated during the war. Such a plan we
have worked out and it has received
the approval of the president."
REBELS ON THREE SIDES OF CITY
JUAREZ, June 12 After a day of
anxiety, rebel troops are reported on
three sides of the town at distances
variously estimated at from two to 20
miles, the latter estimate being that
of the federal commander. Gen. Fran
cisco Gonzales.
In the downtown district stores re
mained open as usual today but there
was a noticeable absence of custom
ers. Many of the more well to do resi
dents have already sought refuge in
El Paso and others are prepared to go
on a moment's notice. Among the mer
chants, such as remain here, there is
apparent a feeling of confidence that
a change in government will not work
, to their disadvantage. This is espe
cially noticeable among the Amer
icans, of whom there are many in busi
ness in Juarez. These people declare
frankly that they have friends on both
sides that they are friendly to both
sides and they hive the fullest confi
dence that Gen. Felipe Angeles will
treat them as well as the Carranza
authorities. '
False Alarms Cause Scurry
Several times during the day there
have been reports that the rebels were
coining, which caused a scurrying in
doors, but each time the report proved
false.
The military authorities are reticeut
about the whereabouts of the rebels,
fut the general belief Is that to the
east of Juarez they are just beyond
rifle range, of the federal trenches.
This belief is cdnfirmed by observers
with fild glasses who watched the
dust clouds moving from the southeast
indicating the presence of a consider
able force of mounted men.
Five hundred federal cavalry who
left iu that directiou early this morn
ing have not reported up to 8 o'clock
Jlonight. but General Gonzales claims
to have bcn in coubtant touch with
'tin. Oi through rucuera.

Launch Arizona Recto Drive
PHOENIX, June 11. To bring
under irrigation and ' cultivation ;
more than 2,000,000 acres of-land
in Arizona, to save and. use every
drop of water, that falls on; every i
: Arizona ': watershed to bring J uSi-jj'
der pvatermiore than double J the
present amount of ' land" irrigated .
.'in .the -v' Salt '.'River - Valley; , to )
, solve the problem of possible ; dry,
'years; to stop the destruction' of :
valuable land by water-logging.
These. kere the features ofa gi
gantic proposal outlined toJ the
Maricopa County Realty board to
might by George H. 'Maxwell, ev
exutive director of . the national
. reclamation association, and up
on which the board, immediately
prepared to launch a reclamation
campaign.
"There are now 300,000 acres of
land under irrigation and culti
vation in the Salt River valley.
1 That can be doubled," said Mr. -;
Maxwell. .
"A . million more acres can be
.irrigated from the Colorado river.
The Gila river, properly con
'Iseryed l and j utilized, would irri
,' gat'eji'&OO.odo i -'acres' more. ?f . ;
I "Two, million acres is "an ultra-'-conservative
. estimate of the to
..vtal'i area ; reclaimable in Arizona.
-(Fixing , the ; annual gross produc- -V
tibn- of the land alone at $100 an .
acre, we would have $200,000,000 -added
every year to our agricul
tural products, and that does not
take account of the enormous
value of the power that would be
developed."
Following Mr. : Maxwell's ad- ;
dress,it was decided to name ten
representative members - of ... the "
board to confer with him on his .
proposal to organize for the open
. Ing of the campaign to "conquer

NATION WIRE STRIKE ! FIGHT OVER LANDS
IS BRANDED FAILURE
(Continued from Page One)
Commercial Telegraphers' Union of
America, who is directing the strike
from headquarters here, after a .num
ber of long distance telephone con
versations with eastern representa
tives declared assurance had been giv
en that the broker operators in ..New
York would join the strike as soon as
developments warrant.
Complete Failure, Says W. U.
Meanwhile officials of the Western
Union Telegraph company claim that
the strike has been a complete failure
so far as that company is concerned,
and officials of the Postal Telegraph
company assert that traffic is being
moved without interruption.
The Association of Western Union
Employes, which represents 65 per
cent of the employes of the Western
Union, received telegrams from all
sections of the country saying all
workers were reporting for duty, de
spite the "propaganda of the strikers
to spread the trouble."
Fewer Postal employes were out to
day than yesterday, according to re
ports to the Chicago office.
President Konenkamp charged that
the attitude of Postmaster General
Burleson had brought on the strike
He said that Mr. Burleson had been in
formed before the strike was called
that all controversy would be cleared
up if he would permit the right of col
lective bargaining and establishment
of a tribunal to fix fair wages.
Postal Conditions Better
The Postal Telegraph, company, in
Chicago, which was hard . hit by the
strike yesterday, reported 'conditions
greatly improved today.
Delivery service of both the West
era Union and Postal was greatly
hampered here by the strike of mes
sengers. President Konenkamp of the
union declared the action of the or
der of aRilroad Telegraphers was r
very important step..
The first arrest thus far reported
to headquarters since the strike begar
was that of Philip Cohen, head of thf
Messenger Boys' union In process of
organization. He was arrested for
picketing at one of the local telegrapr
offices.

PAVING
CONTRACT
FOR BISBEE GOES
TO LOS AH
F. V. McPeak of Los Angeles, con
tractor in cement work, was yesterday
afternoon awarded the contract for
paving of the. streets of Bisbee. The
preliminary work will start at once,
and actual construction work will be
started whenever the council shall dic
tate, probably before July 1. Henderson-
Watson Lumber company were
awarded the contract for furnishing
cement whici will be used in the pav
ing. The award of the contract followed
more than a week's delay, during
which members of the city council,
and, the city engineer were estimating
the figures" submitted in the three
bids, and attending to other details
incident to the award. Bids had been
received from McPeak, from Oswald
& Co., of San Francisco, now working
on the Bisbee-Douglas highway, and
from Warren Brothers of Phoenix. .
The award yesterday was made to
McPeak after a motion to give the
work to Warren Brothers had failed
to secure a second. Councilman A. I.
Rosok opened the meeting by moving
that the bid of Warren Brothers be
accepted. In support of his motion
he cited the fact that the company Is
a resident of the state and a taxpayer
of the county, and that they were will
ing to abide by certain agreements
as to specifications. He failed to re
ceive a second to his motion.
Councilman Bassett Watkins then
moved that the bid of McPeak be ac
cepted, since he himself is a "strong
believer in concrete paving." The mo
tion was seconded, carried four to one
and was made unanimous on the mo
tion of Councilman Rosok.
The bid of McPeak is in the neigh
borhood of 100,000, and provides that
the work shall be completed within
200 working days following the actual
biginning of work. Mr. McPeak will
meet with members of the council and
the city engineer within the next few
days for the purpose of arranging
final details, when he will announce
his program. He is now in the city
from his headquarters in Los. Angeles.

Included In the program for reorgan
ization are an executive department,

ment, agricultural department and
civic department. Included under the
heading of the latter department will

The report of the committee on re
organization follows:
Text of Committee Report '
Bisbee, Ariz.,
June 4, 1919.
To the Board of Directors of the War
ren District Commercial Club: .
Gentlemen:
We, your committee on reorganiza
tion, appointed at the meeting of the
board of directors of the Warren Dis
trict Commercial club, held Wednes
day, May 28, to take up with the sec
retary the plan of reorganization and
recommend such parts of his plan of
reorganization as we saw fit, beg leave
to respectfully submit the following
findings.
We find that in this community, ow
ing to limited field of operation, it
would be advisable for the club to
maintain an executir; department,
highway department, traffic depart
ment, agricultural department, and
Vivic department. The scope of these
various departments as to their opera
tion is as follows:
Scope of Departments
' Executive department: This de
partment 'will consist of the board Of
directors. The president of the organ
ization will act as chairman of this de
partment. .
ITighway department: The purpose
of this department will be to promote
the b'rl'Ung and improvement of high
ways throughout this section; co-operate
with logging automobile routes; to
advocate the installing of tourists'
camping grounds, and to co-operate
with the highway commission.
Traffic department: This depart
ment will be maintained for the solv
ing of the problems of the shipper; ad
justing disputes between the shipper
and transportation companies; give
advice as to rates and routes; to act
as representative of the interests of
shippers before the railroad commis- j
sion and the interstate commerce com-1
mission. We would further suggest
that this department hire, during his
leisure hours, an experienced traffic
man from one of the mining com
panies to check shippers' bills of the
members of this organization. We
feel that, due to a lack of knowledge
as to tariffs and rates, and further
due to inexperience, that a great deal
ot. money could be saved the shippers
in this community by maintaining an
expert along these lines in this depart
ment. :
Agricultural department: This de-
partment will be maintained for the
purpose of developing and encouraging
profitable agriculture, stock raising
and horticulture, the organization of a
farm bureau and to promote close re
lations between the city and outlying
farming districts, to conduct farm dem
onstrations and to work in co-operation
with the farm agents. We would
further suggest that this department
take up with the proper state depart
ment, and find out the entire proce
dure on farm loans, the method of ap
plying for loans, the percentage allow
ed, what Is required by the board of
appraisers, and everything in general
relative to what is necessary for an ap
plicant to do to secure a loan on his
farm. It would further be the duty
of this committee to advocate and pro
mote new roads in the valleys and to
advocate rural delivery, and to help in
general the farmer to find ready mar
ket for his products.
Civic department: This department
would be organized to promote worthy
and suppress unworthy appeals for
charity; to conduct activities to pro
mote community health and happi
ness; to advocate district playgrounds
and to promote vocational education.
The further activities of this depart
ment would be along the lines of sani
tation. Improving of streets, housing
conditions, and to look after in general
the health of the community.
Your committee on reorganization
desires to further recommend that
election of a new board or directors
be held July 15, 1919, and after which
new officers will be elected .from the
newly elected board of directors.
f Respectfully submitted,
J. J. BOWEN, Chairman,
M. J. CUNNINGHAM,
L. J. OVERLOCK.
CANANEA IS COMING
EN MASSE TO HELP
DISTRICTCELEBRATE
AH Cananea will come to the War
ren district on July Fourth, to join in
the local celebration. No plans for an
elaborte celebration will be made in
the Sonora camp. Thi3 was the an
nouncement of visitors in the district
yesterday from Cananea, one of whom
came here to inquire into the details
of the district's celebration.
E. C. "Blackie" Saunders, of Can
anea, manager of the Cananea Athletic
club, and an inevitable follower ot the
boxing game .announced on his arrival
that he has cancelled arrangements
for a boxing exhibition to have been
held in Cananea, July 4, and will come
here with the entire club membership
to watch the sports which will be
staged in this district. Saunders spent
yesterday with friends in Biebee and
Lowell. ; -
Cananea, declares Saunders, who is
an employe of the Cananea Consoli
dated Copper company, is in better
condition at the present time than at
any time in many months. The mine3
are again working a large force of
men, and began shipping copper sev
eral days ago. Two more units of the
big smelter will be blown . in about
June 15, and on that date the produc
tion of the company will be largely increased.
Meanest Man In
World At Large
Again in Warren
The meanest man in the world
is again at large in the Warren
district. He began his campaign
of crime and horror on Wednesday
night. The scene of his deeds ia
Warren. He is using strychnine.
And, officers of the law and a
detective employed for the par
pose are hunting for him.
His first victim of this summer
was the pet airedale of U. S. Rat
tery of .Warren, foreman of the
Junction mine. Rattery kept the
dog inside his yard. She was the
family pet, a dog old enough to
have good .habits, and a dog well
broken of all bad habits. He and
his family are mourning her loss,
for she was to them, a valuable
animal.
During the early . summer
months for the past several years,
the dog poisoner has been busy in
Warren and Lowell. Officers are
determined this year to' catch the
culprit, and they promise no end
of misery for him when he is apprehended.

Jitney Operators Wrathy; Petitions
For Motor Law Referendum Vanish
Jitney operators of this district
and of Cochise county who laid off
work one whole day last week for
the purpose of circulating pjeti
tions to place the jitney regulation
law passed by the last legislature
before the voters for referendum,
have gone to all their pains and
work for nothing, according to the
report yesterday telegraphed the
county attorney's office at Tomb
stone and brought to this city last
night by M. I. McKelligon, assist
ant county attorney.
The petitions, signed with sev
eral thousands of names and ready
for presentation to the secretary
of state, were stolen from the bed
room of Charles R. Francis of
Douglas, the telegram declared.
No trace of them can be found.
The thief entered the bedroom
through, a window, and took noth
ing but the missing papers.
Jitney drivers of the district
Joined a concerted movement of
rent car drivers of the state in
the securing of signatures for the
petitions which would call a refer
endum on the bill. The bill pro
vided that jitney operators should
file with the corporation commis
sion a certificate showing that
necessity for their operation ex
isted, that they should file also a
schedule of route, and finally that
they should file a schedule of
prices. Under the law they would
not be permitted to loave their
routes during hours of schedule.
The jitney operators objected to
the law on the ground that it
would force them to quit business
whenever they should have to file
a certificate of necessity.
During one whole day 50 or
more jitney operators in-this dis
trict quit work and each armed
with a petition, they- made the'
rounds of the district securing
signatures. When the names of
signers Were counted it was dis
covered sufficient had been se
cured in the one day, and Charles
R. Francis was commissioned to
take the petitions to Phoenix for
filing.
FRANCIS REPORTS LOSS
PHOENIX, June 12. A refer
endum petition brought here by
Charles T. Francis, member of the
legislture, from Bisbee, for filing
againstthe bill passed by the leg
islature, placing automobiles ply
ing for hire in the state' under
the jurisdiction of the corporation
commission, has been stolen, or
has disappeared, according to the
statement of Mr. Francis tonight.
As today marked the close of the
period . within which referendum
petitions could be filed, the regu
lations governing jitney busses
and auto stage and truck lines
will go into effect without further
opposition.
The failure of another referen
dum petition was announced to
day by R. E. McCillen, acting secv
retary of state. This was filed
against the land lease law and
the official canvass showed that
the petition carried only 2118
names, whereas, it was said, 2598
signatures is the 5 per cent of the
total of registered voters required
to refer any measure to the peo
ple. The status of the land lease
law, as an emergency measure
not carrying the executive signa
ture, still is undecided, the refer
endum petition having been filed
by its opponents in an effort to
block It should it be upheld in the
courts.

Observing The Unities
The French government is showing great resourcefulness in finding
Appropriate lodgings for the reluctant visitors who have found it necessary
to become its guests while transacting distasteful but unavoidable
business with the peace conference. The Germans were bidden to
Versailles, the history and associations of which seemed to designate it
with particular poetic fitness as the abode of the wrecked conspirators
who had essayed to follow the footsteps of Bismark and Moltke.
When the Austrians arrived the government was not for a moment
at a loss. It remembered that at St. Germains Louis XIV had provided
shelter for refugees as friendless and throneless and kingdomless as the
Austrians now are. It wah here that James II was lodged with the luck
less infant prince who was popularly supposed in IJngland to have been
smuggled into his father's palace in a warming pan. St. Germains was
just the place to drop- the curtain on the last act of Austrian empire as
It had there been rung down on the vanished power of the Stuarts.
And now, In a properly descending scale, the Turkish mission is to
be housed in a mere villa at the obscure village of Vaucresson, a place
with as little tradition and background as the Turks themselves but
furnishing, as we may suppose, a correct notion of what the French gov
ernment regards as commensurate with Turkey's Importance. But it
begins to look a little discouraging for the Bulgarians, whom we may
expect to see lodged in a kitchenette flat a couple of flights up over a
grocery store.

Certainly Not
The Same Old World
Students of a Lincoln, Neb., medical school have been found out.
They ywere caught cheating in their examinations and it is said that
arrests and.puniahments will .follow. nTh$ crime the young men commit
ted was in the employment of, an agent who stole the examination ques-.:
tlons and left them where the students could get hold of them.
Now that we are old and full of, years we can ese the enormity
of the felony which the young medical students committed. It was
very wrong in them to employ an agent to steal the questions, and let us
hope that having gone that far in the dark path of wickedness they
were overtaken with repentance and refused to commite the further sin
of Icoking at the questions with the expectation of cheating in the.
exams."
We who are older, who vent through school and college and uni
versity without breaking the rules, walking always in the path of cir
cumspection, closing our eyes to every temptation to "peak" and resist
ing every inclination to fudge on examination day
Well, what Is the age coming to, anyway cheating in school exami
nations like that?
Are You An Associate Scout?
' This is Boy Scout week. Both the week and ihe scouts have been
widely advertised. Every intelligent person knows who and what Boy
Scouts are how helpful is the physical and mental training given them
and how uplifting are the ideals the leaders in the organization com
municate to their boy charges. All wise and patriotic persons believe
in the principles and practices of the Boy Scouts and are most anxious
that their sphere of influence be extended.
Boy Scout effort is limited. There are said to be about 10,000,000
boys in the United States of scout age. Only about 375,000 actually' are
scouts. It is greatly desired to increase the number of Boy Scouts to at
least 1,000,000; more if provision can be made for them.
President Wilson, in appreciation of the Boy Scouts, proclaimed this
weeK Boy Scout Week and former Secretary of the Treasury W. G. Mc-,
Adoo is chairman of the citizens' committee for the nation. The gover
nors of Texas, New Mexico and Arizona followed the president with
state proclamations.
What is desired of adult people is that they enroll as associate
(members of the Boy Scouts. Men. women and children are eligible.
The cost of associate membership is $1 and the money is to go to field
work for Boy Scouts.
The organization makes better boys. It is a good organization to
belong to and a good one to help along. El Paso Herald.
Jimmy's Post
A little New York boy from the East Side went to France early in
the war. During one of the battles he was hit by a shell and mortally
wounded. It was evident, when he reached the hospital, that he could
live but a short time.
He was lying on his little white bed nearly gone when one of his
"Pals" happened along. Stooping over the boy he whispered, "Jimmy,
where were you hit?"
Jimmy opened his eyes and answered, "I was hit at my post." With
these words on his lips he died, apparently satisfied in the knowledge
that he had been "hit at his post."
What more glorious death is there for any man than being "hit
at his post?"
The world has little time for the man or woman who quits, who
forsakes his or her post in tiraa of danger or of peril.
Stick to your post, no difference what the odds. Perhaps, the very
fact that you stick will cause the opposition to lose heart and quit the
field.

tfpthingLeft But A Grease Spot
The "positive announcement" is made in official circles in Washing
ton that President Wilson will not ask Postmaster General Burleson for
his resignation from the cabinet on account of the muss he has made
of wire control. ; 1
The announcement, however, was hardly necessary. It has been
known all along that if there was a member of the cabinet who had a
lead-pipe cinch on his job, next, of course to Secretary Baker, Mr.
Burleson was that man. And the reason for this general belief through
out the country comes not so much from anything the president has
said, as from the fact that Mr. Baker and Mr. Burleson still hold on in
spit of all the things that might have been expected to detach them
from their jobs in the last two years.

PHOENIX GROWS RAPIDLY
i-iiutniA, June iz. .Phoenix is
making rapid growth 'in population,
as well as additional business estab
lishments, according to data recently
compiled by the local chamber of com
merce.
The government census , figuTes for
the year 1919 showed this city to have
a population of 11,134. 'The estimated
number of residents, which .was gain
ed through official sources, shows a
population of 30,332 for 1918, or a
gain of 19,198 in eight years. Those
who are in close touch with the situa
tion here are of the opinion that the
gain will be much larger during the
next eight years than in the past. -The
population of Maricopa coun
ty and the state have also shown
very substantial growth. The govern
ment census reports sh&w a popula
tion of 20,457 for the county in 1900
and the estimated figures for the end
of 1918 show that 70,254 people re
side within its boundaries. The state
has practically doubled in population
dulrng the past seven years. The
census bf 1910 showing a population
of 204,354, and the recent data shows'
409,203.
Preparations are to be made in the
near future for the gathering of the
government census for 1920 and it is
anticipated that this city and county,
as- well as the remainder of the state,
will show even more a decided In.
crease than during the past two years.

.FkORIA. Ariz., June 12. Fire, said
to have been caused by spontaneous
combustion, last night destroyed the

barn was lost, as were a car of hay
and a car of wheat standing on the

Five acres at $6,500 an acre is $32,500 as a fair value of just one-fifth of our,

Here is our proposition. We need a little more help. Just a handful of

be a gamble, but with hundreds of wells on every hand how can anyone lose
on this investment. Buy now!
M. & P. Burk Well In; Reported 3,500
of Our Lease We have' spoken of our
map again. Have you ever been offered a chance to play the oil game with
any better experienced oil men in any such close-up, proven territory? In a
company whose capitalization is only
the heart of the Burkburnett field which we have just acquired and is com
pletely surrounded by big gushers. About 900 steps directly north is the M.
& P. Burk. which just came in reported 3,500 barrels. . The stock has jumped
away out of sight and prices of $1,100.00 a share are being refused.
Rrimemher a three thousand barrel well net to we stockholders based on
par with our low capitalization of $45,000 means an estimated income of
$7,200.00 per day less the small operating expenses, or 100 per cent every
seven, days. These are facts and figures. Bear in mind that Floyada people
announced 400 per cent dividend to be paid in twenty-one days. We are drill
ing two deep wells, not shallow wells, but right next to the big gushers.
Half Interest In Humble Company Sells for Twenty Million ($20,000,000). See
the Map. The Burk-Waggoner is only a mile east of us. This well came in
running 50 barrels every fifteen minutes. The property just sold out paying
every one back $33.00 to every $1.00 invested. Thrift No. 2, about the same

this new well. , Our derrick is erected now. It is all paid for, so is the lease,
and we are in possession of a' big portion of the drilling fund. If you get in

fast Why? Because we are drilling on proven acreage in -a- field where
leases have already been Teportd sold for $25,000.00 an acr. And because 25

. y .
AUCKXAND, New Zealand. May 2
(Correspondence of the Associated
Press.) iThe battalion of Maoris, New
Zealand, fi.borigines, who fought in tha
Gallipoli '.campaign and afterward in
France, has been welcomed home with
a great fea st, hakas (war dance) and
tangi, or lament for those who fell in
battle.
The acting prime minister, Sir
James Allea, told them, "You Naoris
hold a proud position. You have not
one conscript." From the time of Its
formation eajly in the war the Maori
battalion was maintained at a strength
of 1200 entirely by voluntary enlist
ment. .
Great quantities of mutton, beef,
pork and othcir food had been baked
in earthen evens for the occasion.
About 2000 Maoris in all shared in this
feast. There were several poi (a na
tive delicacy) dances.
The tangi was a scene of much emo
tion. The soldi errs Bat by tribes en
circled, by sorrowing natives. . Led by
their chiefs,- tbe mourners grieved
with low, wailing chants for those of
their race who will aever return. All
the treasured heirlooms of the tribes
had been brought from their safe
keeping for the welcome. There Were
Jade ornaments, mats, chieftains' head
dresses and beautiful kilts. The chiefs
of the various tribes, delivered speech
, es of welcome couched in florid South
sea language, after which there was a
haka by the famous Arawa tribe and
the speech of welcome by Sir James
Allen. x
SOCIALIST UPHEAVAL
HEARING IN FRANCE;
SOLDIERS OPPOSE IT
PARIS, June 12. The political up
heaval in France, predicted as an aft
ermath of the war, appears to have be
gun. After the modification of fac
tional lines in the Socialist party, the
former extremist minority has become
the majority. " , ' .
The new Socialist majority, taking a
far more extreme position than the
element led by Albert Thomas and
Marcel Sembat, former war minister,
does not yet onnly pronounce for Bol
shevist principles, though in the ma.
Jority there is a still further extrem
1st minority that demands immediate
adherence to the doctrines of Lenine.
Several new political elements ap
pear to be in the making and in some
of them the soldier will, for the first
time, make his Influence felt. s.
Soldier candidates are likely to be
numerous. There is already talk of
Colonel Raynal, the hero of the fort
of Vaux, as a candidate against the So
cialist leader and Bolshevist svmpa-
thizer, Jean Longuet, grandson of Karl
Marx. M. Caillaux, whose candidacy
for re-election In the Sarthe has been
announced; may also have a soldier op
ponent. General Mangin's name has
been mentioned in this connection but
probably without authority...-

NEW -YORK,'- June 12. The money
'situation again 'today Caused a decline
in. the final hour of .'trading bnv.the
toc kexcTharige".'.' A rise .167 9" percent
for call loans . unsettled prices 3 at d
Itimie when they iwere. pursuing b. vigor-
ibHSvUpward course -and the arlif "gains'
sionwere largely reduced or' ehtirely
lost'. "
The advance in the '.interest -rate
from the normal 6'per cent was the
third of itf kind In three consecutive
days" and was interpreted in some
quarters as a rebuke to professional
interests who are seemingly inclined
to ignore the federal reserve bank's
note of warning against speculation.
During the greater part of the ses
sion prices were marked up steadily
with speculation becoming very broad,
numerous shares which commonly do
not figure to a notable extent in the
dealings, advancing 4 to 5 points.
The enthusiasm which was mani
fested for the long side . of the ac
count was attributed almost entirely
to the fact that speculative interests
were disposed to take into account the
numerous favorable factors in the
general situation, including brilliant
crop reports and revived inquiries on
a large scale for copper and steel.
Sales, 1,400,000 shares.
Bonds inclined upward with Victory
3?i's establishing" a new high record
at $100; total sales, par value, ag
gregated $11,400,000. Old United
States bond3 unchanged on call.
THE GRAIN MARKET
CHICAGO, June 12. Demand for
corn broadened out to an unusual ex
tent today owing lorgely to unfavor
able crop conditions and to talk of
falling off in rural consignments. The
market closed strong, 3c to 4c net
higher with July $1.71 to $1.71 and
September $1.64 to $1.65. Oats
gained lo to 2c and provisions
10c to $1.35.
Highest prices yet this season were
reached in corn by the July delivery
which with other months closed at
cirtually the top level of the day. Ex
cessive moisture with prospects of
more wet weather, le dto more bullish
prospects on domestic crop losses. At
the same time serious results from
drought in France and Great Britain
attracted a good deal of notice. SteepJ
fresh upturns in the value of hogs J
tended to further stimulate buying off
corn, a disposition which toward the
last was greatly increased on account
of advices that shipments from first
haud next week undergo a big cut.
About the only important selling was
to realize profits.
Oats trade was much enlarged, and
the sentiment bullish. Adverse crop
conditions appeared to be chiefly re
sponsible. . Lard soared to a new top record
price and carried other provisions sky
ward. Most of the impetus came from
the strength of grain and hogs.

SUFFERS 40 VEARS
HAD LOST ALL HOPE OF EVER
BEING WELL AGAIN TANLAC
RESTORES HEALTH
Mrs. Olive M. Brown, a highly es
teemed resident of Calistoga, Calif.,
called at the Owl Drug Store in Los
Angeles, recently, and made the state
ment that Tanlac had completely re
lieved her of a case of stomach trouble
from which she- had suffered for 40
years.
Mrs. Brown's statement, while in
deed remarkable, is by no means unus
ual as many thousands of well known
people all over the country, have testi
fied to having used the medicine with
the same wonderful results.
"For the first time in years," said
Mrs. Brown, "I am able to eat what I
want without any bad after affects,
and I must say Tanlac is a perfectly
grand medicine. I suffered with indi
gestion and constipation all the time,
often had severe pains in my stomach,
and was seldom free from headache. I
had suffered so long that my nerves
were all shattered and I had lost about
all my strength.
"I have tried every kind of medicine
and have been under treatment many
times, but could only get relief for a
little while at a time, and then feel
worse than ever. In fact, the older I
got the worse I suffered and I had long
since lost hope of ever getting relief.
Finally a lidy friend of mine, who had
taken Tanlac. persuaded me to try it.
and as I said, fo rthe first time in all
these years. I can eat what I want and
never suffer any whatever from gaa
and pains in my 6tomach. My head-

It isn't nge, it's careless living that

The kidneys ore the most over

When they break down, under the

These sharp crystals toar and scratch
the delicate urinary channels causing
excruciating pain and set up irrita

deadly Bright's Disease.
One of the first warnings of elnsr
sish kidney action is pain or stiffness
