IN DEATH PLAN
Suspect Declared to Have Told Fellow Prisoners He Would j
Kill Wilson After Receiving Instructions j
From I, W. W.
KANSAS CITY. Mo.. Feb. 1 L Pietro Pierre, alleged
I. W. W. leader, was arrested today by federal officers in
Cleveland, Ohio, according to messages from them. He
was charged with conspiring against the life of President
Wilson, say local government agents and held on $10,000
bond.
Pierre was released from the federal penitentiary at
Leavenworth, rCans.', October 14 last, after serving a year
and a day for opposition to the selective draft. Shortly be
fore his discharge from prison Pierre is alleged to have told
fellow prisoners he had been chosen to attack the president,
and to have added that he would go to Chicago for final in
structions at I. W. W. headquarters there.
The alleged plot also included the murder of William
G. AIcAdoo, former secretary of the treasury, according to
the secret service men. R. Bobba, a Chicago LAV. W., is
said to have told Pierre he had been chosen to do the
work.
The scheme is said to have involved a number of an
archists and to have been revealed through loyalty of two
Italian convicts serving sentences in the federal penitenti
ary at Leavenworth. The two prisoners were cell mates
of Pierre, and to them he is said to have confined his secret.
Bobba will be held under observation at the prison, it
is stated. He is said to be a well known I. W. W. agitator
in the Arizona mining camps. In July, 1917, he was a
leader in the Globe strike.

j poiut the Question of secret asrve-
tnents.
Although the independents lost In
their contention that Germany should
pave the way for the emiiv worl.t in
going definitely on record in favor
open diplomatic asreements, they
rose belatedly to make the acceptance
of the constitution as a whole unani
mous, despite the inclusion of the
clause they had opposed.
This paragraph a part of the sixth
clause of the constitution reads as
originally conveived and now ac
cepted. Wanted Clause Altered
"As soon as the Oerruan empire is
represented in the leasue of nations
with the aim to exclude secret agree
ments, all agreements with the na
tions allied in the league must hav
the acquiescence of the national as
sembly and the state commission."
The state commission corresponds
to the federal council, or sccoid
chamber.
The independents sought to have
this clause altered so that Germany
might unequivocally go on record a
lesfally bouud euter into no secret

states may do in the future. The tixht

Den berg Supports Claust
Dr. Dernbers in supporting the
clause as it was finally adopted said
that it was impossible tor Gernvauy
to hope to make agreements with
other nations, if they adhered to se
cret methods while Germany, by its
own constitution was duly bound to
publish all the terms in detail.
IV. Haase replied that one of th
great objects of the revolution had
been the elimination of secrecy. He
contended that Germany could well
afford to lead the way to peace by
the path, of openness, no matter what
others did. ar.d as an evidence of the
sincerity and genuineness of her re
form. Count von Brockdorff-Rantfau as
sured Dr. Haase that b." w-ould never'
make a secret treaty or agreement.
but Dr. Haase replied that ther was
no assurance how long he would be
in power. He ridiculed Dr. IVrn

The independents at first raised

Thousand Soldiers in Peace
Mission Squad Busier'n the

By EDWARD M. THIERRY
IX. E. A. Staff Correspondent. Paris)
It's an honor to be a member of
the soldier guard at the headquarters
of the American Peace Mission.
But it's frightfully hard on the right
arm.
An honor guardsman does more
saluting in 15 minutes than the aver
age doughboy does in a week.
Generals. of all descriptions and col
onels and majors and captains an.
lieutenants ran in and out all day at
the Hotel Crillon. where the Peace
Mission lives and works. It's almost
as bad at No. 4 Place de la ConcorGe.
That's next door to the Crillon. The
peace mission occupies the entire two
buildings.
The crillon was a topnotch hotel,
operated right up to the time Presi
dent Wilson arrived. Then the Uni-

ted States took it over. The other
building used to be a hotel before the
war. Until last fall it housed the
American Red Cross.
Guards are on duty day and night
at all the doors. They salute me
chanically, just like automatons.
There are plenty of real officers.

The peace mission honor squad com

At first it was thought 140 men

sion needed clerks, linotype operators,
orderlies, stenographers, hotel man
agers, filing men. cooks, mechanics,
cigar salesmen, electricians, private
secretaries and the like. ,
- Everything is run by soldiers. The
peace mission even has its own photo
graphic room. Anybody getting a pass
to enter peace headquarters has to
have his picture taken by the soldier
photographer.
The directory of headquarters looks
like that of a skyscraper back home.
On every floor one stumbles over
hundreds -of clerks and secretaries,
pcunding typewriters, holding confer
ences, putting papers into files, taking
papers out of files or racing upstairs
and downstairs with messages and
memoranda.

Only a small part cf the hearing
today was devoted to bolshevik prop

he had seen a few evidences of these
efforts in the United States. He men
tioned an article by Premier Ienine

American magazine, and said he had
seen several articles in the New York
Times, written by Arthur R. Ransom,
an English writer, whom he described

Arizona's Financial Spree
, Legislators of Arizona appear to be infected with the same financial
extravagance that recently has prompted congress to plan spending in
the next fiscal year ten billions of dollars. Not a day passed but news
filters out of the state house of some newly planned expenditure.
This means enormous taxes this year and next. It means added
burdens for the citizens of this state.
Already plans for appropriations have reached large figure, and
the legislature has been in session just twenty-six days. Proposed ap
propriations of the future will be much larger, since they must of course
Include the general appropriations bill for all state agencies for the next
two years.
The mania for spending seems to have taken hold of each member
of each branch. Not satisfied with, confining themselves to necessary
expenses, they turn their imaginations loose to find new measures carry
ing appropriations.
And topping all proposed measures is the widely-heralded bill to
issue thirty millions in bonds to build roads.
Here is just a partial list of appropriations already proposed, some
of which are passed, some of which have been defeated, and many of
which are still under consideration:
To provide expenses for the current legislative session.
To appropriate 1363.75 covering a deficit in the state law library.
To provide funds for burial of ex-soldiers, sailors and marines and
their relatives and dependents.
To appropriate $600 for copyrighting and publishing a state anthem.
To provide $4300 relief for the governor's office.
To create a board of charities and appropriate $10,000 for its ex
penses. To provide $2400 relief for auditor's office.
To create, a state highway department, and appropriate funds for
a half-dozen or more state employes.
To appropriate Ji00,0nO for extermination of predatory aninrals.
To provide $10,000 to encourage drilling for ofL
To appropriate $15,000 for the northern Arizona fair.
To appoint and compensate deputy court reporters.
To increase salaries of superior judges.
To create a commission for the care of orphans and appropriate funds
for the commission's expenses, etc.
To create and provi3e expenses for a state library commission.
To appropriate JS-53 to cover a deficit in the appropriation for this
year's automobile license tags.
To appropriate 54s.5 relief for business houses of Willcox.
To provide moneys of undetermined amount for the Arizona Soldiers'
Settlement fund.
To appropriate $2550.95 relief for the board of trustees of the North
ern Arizona Normal school
To appropriate $10,000 to entertain soldiers in few York city.
To appropriate $20,000 to bridge Oak Creek in Yavapai county.
To raise the salaries of Tarious county officers.
To appropriate $250 relief to a Phoenix printing house.
To provide $10,000 for the erection of a Luke memorial
To appropriate $250,0-00 for a miners' hospital.
To appropriate a half-million dollars to sustain state institutions for
the remainder of this fiscal year.
To raise salaries .of state legislators.
This is a partial list; some of the measures are meritorious, others
less worthy; many other measures introduced carry special appropria
tions and many other appropriations have been proposed. But. it is list
enough to show that in twenty-six days the legislature has planned ex
travagant spending of state funds.
If they add to this the general appropriations and the proposed
thirty millions road bond issue, laying aside all other proposed appropria
tions, the burden on the people of the state will be more than excessive.
It will mean enormous taxes, money which normally would be available
for reconstruction and ' expansion of business. Nobody would complain
if the expenditures were necessary and legitimate.
What hurts is feeling that the money is being needlessly appropri
ated, is being foolishly spent and wasted, and that the taxpayers will
have to foot these bills.
Where is this sort of thing to end? The money must be found. It
doesnt grow on bushes. It must come out of the pockets of the people.
Money that ought to be spent in improving mines and industries, in
paying wages and making farms more productive is being diverted to
an sorts of extravagancies proposed or conducted by persons with
theories, who do not have to foot the bills.
The people of Arizona haven't yet realized what is being done with
their money. When they do the legislature will hear from them. No
public men and no. political party can afford to be responsible for a
continuation of this money spending orgy.
The ultimate result of continued extravagance by those now in
office will be not only the defeat of legislation proposing gigantic road
bond issues,.but defeat of politicians who support this financial spree.
Praise for the Doughboy
'
Give the doughboy, the tough, grim, hard, swearing, sweating, work
ing pri.-fte his share of the praise for aciomplishments abroad. He is
the hero of the war. He did the work; he won the battles.
To be sure, give credit where it is due. Praise the officer. His direc
tions, his orders, his technical knowledge of military activities, were the
motive power behind the doughboy. But the doughboy did the work.
Arizona's doughboy's are returning home each day, some of then crip
pled and broken in health, many of them bearing wound stripes. Give
them their dues. They did the work.
Others of the Arizona doughboys are breezing in from the American
camps, where battles were fought "on this side in preparation for greater
struggles in Europe. Sing their praise. They did the work.
Don't bestow all the honors on the men who commanded. Remem
ber the men who received and carried out the commands. Theirs was
the risk and theirs is the' glory won. 1-'
The doughboyC ho served on this side of the great pond deserves the
same praise as the doughboy who served 'over there.
But above all remember the doughboy. When you meet him on the
street, shake his hand and tell him how glad you are to see him home.
When he sends word ahead he will arrive, get your friends out as a com
mittee of welcome. Let him know he has been missed and make him
know how glad everyone is he has returned.
Remember the doughboy and when he returns in sufficient num
ber get out the band and the whole town in one rippin'est. snortin'est.
shoiuin'est. holiday celebrations ever staged in his old home village.
And sicg his praise; he did the work.

LABOR PROTESTS
I BILL
Governor's Suggestion for In-
dustrial Department
Is Endorsed
(By Review Leased 'Vire
PHOENIX. Ariz Feb. 11 The exe
cutive board of the Arizona state fed-
i eratlon of labor today sent to the low-1
er house of the legislature a vigorous
protest against senate bill 52. which
ouia provide ior tne tormation of a
state arbitration board.
I The labor federation communica
tion, which was read and referred to
the committee considering the bill,
said in part:
"We have been directed to address
your body that senate bill 52, an act
to create a state board of arbitra
tion, was found by our board to be
so inconsistent, inapplicable and ap
parently drafted by some one wholly
ignorant of industrial" and legal ques
tions that we do not deem it worthy
of serious consideration either by this
board, representing the workers of
the state, or by the legislature, repre
senting the people."
The communication was signed bv
Thomas J. Croaff, president and Geo.
D. Smith, secretary of the state fed
eration of labor.
Governor's Plan Endorsed
Two other communications were re
ceived from the federation. One en-
aorsea a suggestion in Governor
Campbell's message to the legislature
urging the establishment of an indus
trial department in the state ana
read:
"We are directed to address your
body urging the establishment of a
state labor or industrial department
with a commissioner in charge, ap
pointed by and responsible to the gov
ernor, the said commissioner and de
partment to be endowed with the du
ties and functions of a state depart
ment of labor."
The third letter flatly disapproved
of any attempt to alter the workmen's
compensation, laws of the state, say
ing: "We deem it unwise at this time, on
account of the existing unsettled in
dustrial conditions, to participate in
any movement looking toward a
change in the workmen's compensa-
tion laws. This action is taken afte

j ToiScience of Good Cooking
- -4tifi Art of Correct Service
i BY BIDDY BYE.
j Welf-cooked food is not the only
t
essential to "a good meal." The serv
ing of what is cooked quickly, daint
ily, quietly, easily is an art which
must be mastered by every woman
who values the good temper, good
manners, and even the pood health of
her family.
Scientific experiments have proved
I that the process of disrestion is aided
oy me good numor ot tne person eat
ing; hindered, or even stopped, if the
eater is irritated or hurried. A sense
of comfort and pleasure at meal time
is almost as important as food itself.
In most homes, meals are served
without the help of a maid. The table
must be laid with special provision
for several members of the family to
J help in sen ing. The diagram here
with shows the proper method.
At each place, the fork or forks are
lail at the left or the plate, tines up.
A dinner fork and salad fork are the
usual ones required. They are laid
about an inch apart and an inch in
from the edge of the table. The knife
is laid at the right of the plate, with
the sharp edge inward. Spoons are
put -at the right of the kuives. If a
soup or bullion spoon is used, it Is
laid, bowl up, farthest from the ri.uht
of the plate. However much or little
silver is used, good form demands
that it be arranged in order of use;
those to be used first put at the out
side, farthest from the plate.
The napkin, folded or m a ring, is
placed at the left of the forks. The
glass for water, ri:;kt side up, is put
at the right, just above the top of the
knife. The bread and butter plate,
with butter knife laid across it, is set
a little above and just back of the
forks. The dioncr plate may be put
at each plare or piled before the per
son who serves the meat, or main
dish, as desired.

Government Condemn
ed by Delegates
iBy Review leased Yire
PHOENIX. Ariz.. Feb. 11. The
Question of the control of the public
aomam. including m Arizona 21.000.000
acres of unappropriated unreserved
public lands, sprang to the fore at the
opening of the twelfth annual session
of the Arizona Cattle Growers" asso
ciation today and promises to be the
leading problem throughout the three
days' meeting.
Two speakers dealt exhaustively
with this matter today, the associa
tion's president, Charles P. Mullen of j
SKuil valley, and Uwicht B. Heard,
memlier of the executive committee
and formerly president of the National
Livestock association.
President Mullen, in his annual ad
dress, said in part:
"A question of great moment is that
of the passage by congress of a law
providing for the control and use of
the public domain by stock raisers. To
my mind this is one of the most vital
questions to come before this conven
tion. It has been demonstrated con
clusively that to obtain the maximum
production of meat, there must be
some control of the unappropriated
public domain.
Rangers Overstocked

the fact that the ranees are over
stocked by the cattlemen, hut that the
sheepmen are encroaching on the cat-

j Proposed Measure Sets Aside
$100,000 to Aid Rec
lamation Service
t!y Review Leased Wire'
PHOENIX. Arts.. Feb. 11 Legisla
tion was introduced in the state sen-
to the statutes providing a code for
ate today to set aside $100,000 to aid
the reclamation service of the United
States department of the interior in
making surveys of feasible irrigation
projects in Arizona. The measure
also looks to the drafting of plans tor
the storage and diversion of water and
naming each county a reclamation dis
trict with duly appointed deputy land
commissioners. Under the bill author
ity would be delegated to execute con
tracts with the federal Interlal de-
Ipartment's reclamation service.
Hushes introduced an amendment
the systematic administration and pro
tection of state lands and vesting the
necessary powers In a new depart
ment to be known as the state land!
department. The bill also would cre
ate the office of state land commis
sioner. Devine brought in three bills, all in
tended to broaden the powers of the
state corporation commission. The
first is designed to give that body a
firm grip on the dealings of brokers
and the other two would bring the
investment companies more closely
under the jurisdiction of the commis
sion. Teachers with a record of honorable
service, and delinquent children under
the age of 14 years were the subjects
of two bills Introduced respectively
by Hicks and Hughes. One measure
would allct a pension of $600 a year
to teachers after 25 years service and
the other would appropriate $50,000
to build a home for the care of chil
dren under the care of the juvenile
courts. For salaries. $30,000 also
would be provided, together with what
ever appropriatiens the different coun
ties would allow. v ,

for 15 n inute service iK-tween Ei-.?ee
and Lc-wriL Its ra:? as filed is ten
cents.
ThL-. Schideler interprets to mean
that he and other "independ
ents'" will be classed under what he
says is a recent ruling of the corpora
tion commission, as 'fiy-by-nightersr'
whose rale must be 140 per cent of
that of the regularly established stage
line. That would mean a ten cent rate
between here and Lowell on the new
stage line and a 45 cent fare on all
other cars, he said. This would mean
putting the independents practically
out o business, he declared.
Claims Better Service-
Shideler farther claimed that he and
other independents were giving better
service than a 15 minute Bcbedule
would imply as the average distance
traveled by ten of the cars had been
found to be 500 miles daily or 50
miles per car which would mean an
average of a car every eight minutes.
The new incorporation, on the other
hand, is understood to have the argu
ment that few if any cars have shown
tip for service before 10 o'clock in the
morning, occasioning much Inconven
ience to the public.
But old P-T. is dead, I sez to myself.

placed a 30 per cent tax in kind on

Mexican paper mills were unable to
supply the demand for paper. At the
time when the decree was abrogated.

DEATH RECORD HERE
SLIGHTLY INCREASED
Tq total number of deaths in the
Warren district during 1913 wa3 S96,
which was exactly 60 greater than the
total for 1917, which .svaa 336. accord
ing to figures compiled by Dr. R. B.
Durfee, city and county bacteriologist.
The increase was largely due to in
fluenza pneumonia, according to statis
tics. However. Dr. Durfee is probing
i into the question of tuberculosis ia
j the district but has not advanced suf
'ficiently to give any definite state
, ment in that regard,
j One peculiar feature he noted in con
tnection with the 1918 death record
i was that while pneumonia had shown
jan Increase, tuberculosis had de
creased In the district to a marked ex
tent.
i IRBY IS ARRESTED.
' Cleve lrby, an' automobile man at ;

GADSDEN ORE STRIKE
. NOT LARGE BODY
While highly encouraging, the re
! cently reported strike in the 1200 foot
; drift of the Gadsden mine at Jerome
! was not to be ranked as a large dis
jcovery, it was learned on reliable
authority yesterday. The drift passed
J through about 30 feet of oxidized ma-
terial, including some native copper,
j It still is the belief of men associat
ed with the management that the main
fault about 1700 feet distant from the
1200 station, is where are in quantities
will be encountered. If at all. The
jstrOuBB of the body of oxides is con
