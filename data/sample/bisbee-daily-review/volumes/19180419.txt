excuse therefor, they would be unable

any agreement with you. or le able to
do anything with you. Now. I have
known these gentlemen who have
made this statement, for a long time,
and I feel satisfied they would not say
this unless they believed it to.be true.
Now. I want to do justice, and will
give you an opportunity to explain the
matter if you think you can
Mr Schwamm thereupon stated that
he war, in debt to the Bank ef Douglas
to the amount of about J1S.000; that
part ef this Indebtedness was overdue
and that the Bank of Douglas had been
asklne him for pavment. and that he
failed to subscribe because he was not

Judge Lockwood then stated to him
that ii was a well known fact to the

OIL WELL IN GHINO
VALLEY SINKS FAST
Reports received at the general of
fices of the United Chino Oil & Refin
ing company at Phoenix on Thursday
arc to the effect that the first well
which the company is drilling in the
Chiao Valley, in their efforts to prove
up that field for oil. was down to a
depth of 342 feet and that the hole is
in excellent shape. To use the expres
sion of the general manager of the com
pany, "It is as straight as a gun bar
rel." The report further states that the
drill has passed through the flint-like
blue limestone formation which has
made the drilling so slow from the sur
face and that they have now penetrat
ed 75 feet of oil shale, similar to that
showing in the Verde River, where it
passes through the Chino Valley, and
highly impregnated with oil. This is
considered, according to experienced
cil men, a decidedly favorable condi
tion at the depth attained.
From indications which have alrea
dy been encountered, the United Chino
drivers expect to cut the water within
the next few days, and Immediately
case it out At that time, they will
discontinue the use of the huge six
teen inch bit with which the hole was
started In order to make sure of being
able tc go the required depth to, reach
the cil sands, and will use a smaller
bit. This will mean much more rapid
progress in the drilling, and the man
agement of the United Chino expects
within, a very short time to make a
mighty interesting announcement in
connection with the pioneer work they
are doing toward bringing the Chino
Valley of Arizona into the oil produc
ing lnrelight.

Regarding the rate of interest on

"I do not believe that it is necessary
to raii-e the interest on the bonds in
order to sell them. I do not believe
that the patriotism of America is ex
pressed in the rate of interest on a

that the American dollar is a fugitive
that must be chased by high rates of

HARD FIGHTING
CONTINUES WITH
ALLIES GAINING
(Continued from Page One)
ris, the British by a counter stroke
' succeeded in pushing their lines for
' ward toward the village.
Use Troopa Over
The Germans have been bringing up
fr-sh divisions to the Ballleul e.or,
but the most promising sign is that
they are beginning to use for the sec
ond time the troops which had' such
herd fighting in the early days of the
offensive. For the last few days the
high command appears to have de
parted from its usual careful methods.
In order to save time and push for
ward quickly before the allies are able
to get up more reinforcements, the
enemy seems to have been sending
troops into the attack without any
more specific plans that tbey trust
get to a certain general objective.
Junior officers have been directing
much of the righting and going ahead
ton their own initiative. The result
of this has been quite apparent, for
the enemy undoubtedly has been mes
sing affairs at numerous points.
Dead Cover Ground
The most noticeable feature of the
captured documents and letters Is the
continued reference to the great cas
ualties ever since the Germans began
the offensive. They carefbshrdlufwyp
the oifensive. They certainly were
excessive in the first days of the big
push and now the northern battle
fielcr are covered with the bodies of
enemy dead.
Tho Germans are continuing to push
forward cautiously into the positions
the British have evacuated east of
Ypres and the defending artillery has
been playing havoc with the advanc
ing trocps. Twice the enemy massed
to come into the Poligon wood and on
each occasion they were smashed by
artillery fire. The Germans did not
actually get under way for the occu
pation of the Passchendaele defenses
fo- many hours after the wftndra'-tal
was completed.
The country from which the British !
pulled back is an awful mud hole and 1
it will take the enemy a long time to '
mar. the new positions and get his ar-j
tillery forward through the mud.

SOX DROP TWO
(Bv Review IT.seJ WirO)
CHICAGO, April 18. Two pitchers,
Messer and Roberson were cut off the
roster of the Chicago Americans . to
day, both having been released ta the
Minneapolis club of the American association.
!
j Active work to assure the success
of the Warren District Chautauqua,
which opens on April 20, and contin-1
ues for one week, have been begun :
by the committee of guarantors in '
charge of the entertainment. An-;
nouncement was made yesterday of
tlfe show-grounds, of the character of
entertainment to be given and of the
first active drive in the disirict to
interest the public in the Chautau
qua and its performers. The first ad
vertising of the entertainments was .
i posted when a siring or penanta an-,
nonncig the attraction and dates was ;
hung between the Phelps Dodge Mer- j
cantile company's store and the post-,
.'orfice building. j
Attractions of the Chautauqua this .
y?ar will be staged on the around j
hack of the Phelps Dodge store In j
Lowell, instead of on Quality hill, cs !
last year. Several reasons have teen j
given for this change of location. In-,
eluding the facta that the new grounds
is centrally located on the car lines, j
that adequate grounds for the show 1
and for the parking of car.-i trau be j
had, that the long climb of stairs toj
the tents will be eliminated, and that i
the newly chosen spot is ideally lo-1
cated from every standpoint of serving
the most people of the entire district, ;
The sale of tickets and active cam
paigning in the behalf of the attrac
tions will commence on April 23, or a
day later, when the final advance man
of the chautauqua will arrive in the
district. At the same time additional
meetings of the committee will be
called, the Chautauqua parade for the
opening night will be arranged, and
other details will be taken up.
The tenor of the chautauqua this
year will be that of the war. In near
ly every attraction the war has found
its play and phase, and even in the
artistic and musical numbers the con
flict is reflected. , In the appearance
of speakers the war has had an es
pecial reflection, with the result that
nearly all of the lectures are on war
subjects, while some of the lecturers
are among the best known war critics
and experts of the world. The en
tire program is one of patriotism and
nationalism, and will be of high value
to residents of the district In its
teachings and preachings.

Would you have fried springer for j
your Sunday dinner?. i
Since February 23, when a ban was
placed by the fcod administration on
the slaughter of hens and on the sale
of live or freshly killed hens, this dis
trict has tasted few pieces of chicken.
"Half a bird fried" has almost disap
peared from the memory of the restau
rant h?bituant; the waiter would stut
ter and splutter if he attempted to
Fine out the words to the cook.
But now that time is over. This
dis'.rfct, every district In the good old
United States, may have its fried,
springer for Sunday evening dinner.
The fcod administratis says so, and
here is the official ptalement:
"Restrictions 'hgaiast the sale of live
or freshly killed hens w'll be lifted on
Arrll 20, the food administration ar-
nunces. ;A regulation prohibiting li
censed dealers from buying or selling
this lype of fowl, in force sii e Fer

fective until April 3. Weather con
ditions have brought about an -early
laying and hatching period, hdvover.
aid the food administration believes
that the regulation has served .a
purpose. '
"In order to Lest out the effect of
the prohibition, 4no,uirIes have been
made in the principal cbickenYaislrg
states as to the result on production
of eggs and chicks. Replies received
from 23 states, which produce ibout

has had an.-extremely beneficial ef
fect. Ten -states, which account -for
only a minor part of the nation's
poultry stocks, report either no par
ticular benefit or opposition by the
producers. "
"It is estimated that In the New
York. Chicago, and Hoston markets
alone at least three' and a third mil
lion hens capable of producing eggs
and increasing the country's l locks
have been saved, due to the hearty
co-operation and support of the producers.

LIBERTY BOND SLACKERS
Purchasers of Liberty Bonds may be
slackers. The possession of one or more
bonds does not entitle the holder to exon
eration from the stigma of being a slacker.
Only when a person has purchased Liberty
Bonds to his full ability, can it be said that
he is not a slacker.
Liberty Bond slackers have been found
in the Warren District. They are of the
under-purchasing variety, of the clique and
caste which buys one-tenth what it should
buy in order to stand on the curb and boast
of possession of Liberty Bonds. They have
made their money in this district, have lived
here for many years, have been supported
by the district. They refuse to assist the
district, and thereby aid the nation to their
fullest ability, when they are called on to
lend to the government.
Discovery of Liberty Bond slackers in
the district was made when it was an
nounced that the Honor Roll of bond pur
chasers will be published. Committees
canvassing the districts began to receive re
quests not to make public the subscriptions
they received. The banks were over
whelmed with similar requests.
Why should not a resident of this dis
trict wish his name published in the Honor
Roll? W hy should he wish to retain secret
his subscription to the Third Liberty issue?
Why should he request his pledge to this
greatest of causes suppressed?
In the face of the government's request
that every name and pledge to the Third
Liberty issue be published in community
Honor Rolls, there is but one answer to
'these questiens. The man who Would
keep secret the sum he has subscribed is a
self-convicted Liberty Bond slacker. He
knows deep down in his own heart
that he has not pledged to the government
as much as he can afford. He is conscious
that he is shifting the burden to others.
And, he knows that if his subscription is
published others will know he is a slacker.
In the face of these facts, he takes advan
take of "banking courtesy" to request that
he be protected from a public whose right
it is to know.
Officers in charge of the Third Liberty
Loan campaign for this district have an
nounced that they will publish all subscrip
tions which come into their hands. They
have declared themselves in favor of rec
ognizing the government's request. In the
end, they will probably have in hand every
subscription made in the district through
any source. Among their duties is the dis
covery of slackers in this drive. They do
not believe that any purchaser of Liberty
Bonds is due the "courtesy" of suppression.
Rather, they believe each individual should
buy to the limit, and be proud to have a
place in the Honor Roll. And, they are
looking with suspicion on those who have
requested that their names be not pub
lished. Now is no time for procrastination, nor
for doing just your bit. The call of the
government is for everything you can
spare. Give it freely and gladly ! Be proud
that your name is on the honor roll, if it be
for one small bond or many large ones! Be
sure you have purchased to the limit!
THAT TEMPORARY ROAD
Ten days more will see that short strip
of make-shift and temporary roadway just
outside Lowell and detouring the'highway
to Warren, where repairs are being made,
in a practically impassable state. It has
been used now for a week. In that time it
has become actually dangerous, especially
for light and small cars.
1 he arlo!;e character of the ground over
which it runs is such that traffic has cut it
into many rvti. 1 lundreds of automobiles
are passing each other daily on the strip
The dust becomes so deep that the ruts are
partially hidden. M hen a small car of light
weight sinks down into the ruts it is some
times impossible for it to turn out for a
passing vehit 1c.
7 he road ohould not be made perma
nent, for the new highway will more than
supply demands. But, pending the corn-
Losses of positions sustained by the
British armies and French in the great of
fensive may have been prepared for in Feb
ruary and may have been deliberate stra
tegic moves. At any rate, as late as March
I , the allies were prepared to sacrifice por
tions of their lines in the drive. Tha, offi
cial British war document, "The War in
February," a report of progress during that
month and a forecast of days to come,
speaks of the German plans for an offen
sive, and hints broadly at allied plans to
meet the drive.
"The movement of troops continued
steadily (onto the Western front) into
February," toys the statement, "by which
time it was known that Germany had
grouped a great number of divisions, per
haps over 1 70, from units taken out of
Russian and Italian lines.'
This statement of facts was made
twenty-one days before the offensive was
actually launched, and indicates at the
least that the allies were amply forewarned
of possibilities of such an offensive. Con
tinuing, the report says:
"There is no real foundation for the
supposition that Germany can predomin
ate in men, munitions and guns on the wes
tern front, or, at any rate, predominate in
such fashion as to overwhelm the entente.
The accumultaion of men ha3 been carried
on steadily, but early in February Germany
had not yet a superiority over the French
and British alone, quite apart from the Bel
gians, Portuguese and Americans. The
number of German divisions may possibly
increase, but even as things are now, Ger
many cannot hope to marshal numbers
enough to dominate the situation entirely,
and it must be remembered that after she
has made her supreme effort she will, as far
as man-power goes, be exhausted.
She may go into the battle with her full
strength, but it will be her final strength.
What gaps are torn in her line will almost
certainly be permanent gaps. She will not
have adequate reserves to fill themt"
The report here launches' into discus
sion of reserves of the French and British,
forces and strength of. the Americans and
the possibilities of when and where the
Germans might attack. It predicts possible
offensives on several fronts and then de
clares :
"The allies have prepared their defen
sive -on modern conditions and they are
ready to lose portions of their lines under
the first impact of the assaults. The loss of
such territory will have but a slight bear
ing on the battle, the results of which will
be decided on what follows the first move
ments of the offensive."
Granting that the German offensive
has fully started and with the possibilities
of the battle waging for the remainder of
the summer as did Ypres, these statements
of the British war office are refreshing.
They at least give assurance that much of
the territory so far taken by the Germans
was sacrificed for a purpose, and that the
allies have still in their hand the trump
cards.
To pacifists and German sympathizers
who dare still prate of Germany's just and
gentle peace terms is referred the Prussian
"peace" treaty with pitiful Russia, which
gives you a clear idea of just what Ger
many considers a nice and friendly peace
aggrement. By the terms of this generous
peace Germany takes one-third of Russia's
railways, three-quarters of her iron ore,
four-fifths of her coal deposits, fifty-six
million of her population, three hundred
thousand square miles of her territory and
574 breweries. Quite a nice little peace, if
you please. Lenine is one great little peace
maker. Just one more such peace and
Russia will look like a Sandwich Islander
on a clam shell.
Editor Jaynes of the Tucson Citizen,
who recently resigned from the state coun
cil of defense under pressure from Gov.
Hunt, refers to the incident in his newspa
per a3 follows: "The editor cf 1 he Citizen
will feel terribly bad to be removed from
the council of defense by a governor who
writes such sweet missives to members of
the I. W. W. and subscribes to stock in a"
pacifist magazine."
Stories from the battle-fields in 'Han
dera telling about the people made home
less should certainly be a stimulus toward
the purchase of Liberty bonds by the
American public.

Investimation Shows That No
Reliable Prcof Was Shown
Where I. W. W. Were
Knowingly Being Em
ployed.
I'M-jKNIX. pril 18. .Indignant
over what they considered to be charg
es of employment of I. W. W. In vio
lation of the wishes of the federal
government, mining men of the state
I converged upon the executive com
mittee of the state council of defense
at the capitol building' Wednesday,
and demanded a thorough sifting of
the reports upon which the committee
based a resolution last week in which
it was said that reliable reports were
In its hands to the effect that em
ployment was being knowingly given
i. W. W. in the mines.
Besides the execuUve committee
there were present to meet the min
ing men representatives of organized
labor. The latter, who had assumed
th-9 gathering of information for the
cun?il. following the introduction by
Dwisht B. Heard of the reports cur
rent upon which the executive com
mittee based its resolution, presented
I-tters from various secretaries oil
mine unions in several districts and
also presented, verbal statements, in
which it was declared that I. W. W.
were employed and a list of some
twenty names submitted in corrobora
tion. In none of the statements, how
ever, was there affirmation of other
t! an belief that the mining companies
in some instances knew the men to
be. I. W. V. The entire testimony
In this respect boildd down under
(lueslioniiig of the mining men io the
admission that all of the reports were
gossip and nothing more and that
"reliable information did not exist.
Such summary was made of the
matter by Federal Administrator Davis
shcrt'y brfore adjournment was taken
at 1 o'clock, when be was asked to
express his view of the matter as de
volcped in the meeting. "It la nothing
but a gossipy situation," the adminis
trator declared. He said, however, he
felt that the getting together might
no, have been in vain, as it had en
abled a closer lookin from both sides
and might be productive of a better
general understanding. This state
ment followed a declaration made by
G. H. Dowel), spokesman of the min
ing men. who declared in response to
the statement of a labor leader that
the agreement with " Secretary of La
bor Wilson's commisson was not being
lived up to by the mining companies.
that the mining companies were ab
solutely living up to the agreement,
in both letter and spirit that it was
working well and that with the as
sistance of organized labor in the
state it would continu? to work veil.
Demand of labor leaders to know
whether there would be agreement to
a meeting between the mining men
and organized labor representatives to
settle -iifferences was answered with
tin direct assertion that the agree
ncnt with the commission of Sec
retary Wilson had removed differ
ences, that they did no exist and
that any meeting outside the request
and conduct of the federal .administra
tors would be a direct slap in the
federal face and a violation of the
agreement. Judge Davis" subsequent
remarks indirectly upheld this atti
tude. Outcome of the session amounted to
withdrawal of the executive commit
tee of the council of defense from "he
position that ''reliaby information
as , available to support the gossip
of employment of I. W. VA'., assertions
to the contrary and of known trans
portation of I. W. V. into the state
to undertake employment having been
riddled during the morning by brief
rjuestions tersely put by the mining
men. The assemblage of the mining
men to demand the proof of the inti
mations in the resolution was, there
fore, conclusive in its result in bury
ing the falsehood and in clearing the
atmosphere of much general insinu
ation that has been going around, to
gether with clearance of the board 8
of reports that differences existed be
tween employers and employes in the
state.

At the meeting of the Women's Lib

held Wednesday night at the court
houve, the committees who have been
at v crk since the campaign opened
made their reports, which show that
up to last night a total of $12,500 had
been subscribed by Tombstone with a
nun Ijii of the biggest buyers yet to
place their subscriptions. This means
tha. Tombstone has over-subscribed
it? qncta to date of over one-hair, the
quota being $8,553. The women pledge
themselves to work unceasingly until
the closing date of the campaign, when
they expect to add at least one or two

due the Old Camp on the completion
of its quota. A star is added to the

Three men dug their way out of the
new highly tooted Douglas city jail
lasi night and made their escape. A
Mexican boy tossed a piece of string
up to nine prisoners in the cell. An
old axe was tied to the end of it. With
apparent ease the prisoners made a
hole through the east side of the wall,
big enough for a man to crawl in or
out of. In digging tfie hole through the
celt wall no steel or iron to reinforce
the concrete was encountered. Accord
ing to the contractor, the specifica
tions for the new jail called for rein
forced concrete steel rods three feet
apart.
Why the other six men didn't escape
is unknown. Any man in the cell, un
less it is one alleged bootlegger who is
rather ample, could have gone through
the hole without difficulty.

tirao was lost in investigating the

Schwertner was accused of hoarding
flour and selling it without substitutes
and as required by the regulations,
and when confronted with the possibil
ity of a 13,000 fine and two years' im
prisonment as the maximum penalty
which might be inflicted, he expressed
his willingness to retire from business
and dispose of his stock on hand in
any manner which the food admlnistra
tion might suggest, rather than stand
a trial.
Accordingly a stipulation was enter
ed into whereby Schwertner Is Imme
diately to turn over to the government
his entire supply of flour and sugar,
and ic allowed thirty days in which to

Mining and Financial News
BY REVIEW
NEW YORK. April IS. The slock
market's extreme dependence upon the
war situation was strikingly empha
sized during today's operations. Trad
ing was dull and narrow in the first
half of the session. Hut it broadened
and strengthened later on news that
Kreuch troops had reinforced the Brit
ish along the northern battle front.
Shorts scrambled to cover and bulng
for the long account was evident in
the general advance of 1 to 3 points.
A few of the speculative issues gain
ing 3 to 5 points.
1'nited States steer featured the
raUe, being confidently absorbed in
the usual large individual blocks at
an extreme gain of 27s, virtually all
of which was held. Other equipments,
coppers, shippings, oils, sugar and a
miscellaneous variety o folw priced
specialties scored gains of 1 to 4
points.
Sales amounted to 535,000 shares,
the largest turnover in almost a
month.
Iomestic development had no direct
bearing upon the market. The re
ports of several leading copper pro
ducing companies varied, but quarter
ly statements of the independent steel
companies were mainly favorable.
Monetary conditions were conflicting,
call loans suffered while time 'funds
were in freer supply, tbaugh quotab'ly
unchanged. Ilonds were irregular.
Libertv issues were active but vari
able. Sales, pat value, aggregated
$j.750.0'K. 1'nited States bonds, old
issues unchanged on call.

Selling pressure which developed in
the last half of the session and which
became especially pronounced in the
final hour, formed a direct contrast
with the lock of aggressiveness at first
displayed on the bear sid of the corn
market.
Assertions that exporters had with
drawn bids counted materially u a
depressing factor in the oats trade.
Provisions weakened with hogs, cot

STEP LIVELY! CORNS
QUIT WITH "GETS-IT"
The Great Corn-Looiener of the Age.
Never Fails. Painless.
Watch my step? What's the use? I
go "right side up without care," even
because I use "Gets-It," the painless,
off-like-a-banana-peel corn remover. I
tried other ways galore, until I was
blue in the face and red in the toes.
No more for me. Use "Gets-It." . It
never fails. Touch any corn or callus
with two drops of "Gets-It," and "Gets
It" does the rest. It's a relief to be
able to stop cutting corns, making
them bleed, wrapping them up like
packages and using sticky tape and
salves. It removes any corn clear and
clean, leaving the toe as smooth as
your palm. Y'ou can wear those new
shoes without pain, dance and be
frisky on your feet. It's great to use
"Gets-It
"Gets-It" is sold at all druggists

a bottle), or sent on receipt of price

If the peoples of the earth are not to become toiling
millions for the Prussian Junkers and the Prussian Krupps,
if they are not to be terror-ridden slaves at the mercy of a
German Kaiser's will, Prussianisnvmust be driven back
within its own borders and kept there.

Not only English freedom, French free
dom is at stake. Our own cherished institutipns,
our free government, all that our fathers fought for,
all that free peoples prize, is threatened by an enemy
that would impose his own hateful Kultur on every
free institution in every liberty-loving land.
That is why the war must be fought
on European soil. We are fighting in Europe now
that we may not have to fight in America, on the .
very thresholds of our own homes, later.
We are fighting for the safety and
liberty of our children, our homes,
our country. No price is too great to pay for
v ictory. . a
Americans, you are called upon to
back our armies in France, to furnish them the
guns and shells and ships and airplanes, the enor
mous quantities of every sort of supplies that they
must have to defeat the Prussian armies and drive
them back across the Rhine.

Juice of Lemons!
How to Make Skin
White and Beautiful
At the cost of a small jar ot ordin
ary cold cream one can prepare a full
quarter pint of the most wonderful
lemon skin tfjftener and complexion
beautifier, by squeezing the juice of
two fresh lemons Into a bottle con
taining three ounces of orchard white.
Care should be taken to strain the
juice through a fine cloth so no lemon
pulp gets in, then this lotion will keep
fresh for months. Every woman knows
j that lemon juice is used to bleach and
remove such blemishes as sallowness,
freckles, and tan and is the ideal skin
softener, smoothener and beautifier.
Just try it! Get three ounces of
orchard white at any pharmacy and
two lemons from the grocer and make
up a quarter pint of this sweetly fra
I grant lemon lotion and massage it
! daily into the face, neck, arms and
! hands. It naturally should help to
soften, freshen, bleach and bring out
the roses and beauty of any skin. It
Is wonderful to smoothen rough, red
hands.

MOST HUMAN ILLS
TRACED BY SCIENCE
TO COMMON CAUSE
Remarkable Demonstration of
This Theory Is Found in
Dallas Woman's Case
. Science has discovered that most of
the many ins that attiict humanity are
traceable to a disordered condition ot
the stomach and intestines. Keep
ihtbe organs healthy and active and
you will remain strong, sturdy and
well, as nature Intended you should be.
Then it you are a victim of stomach
foubie, or any of the numerous dis
agreeable symptoms resulting from it,
tfo experience of others in your owu
city or community who have testified
to (be benefits they have obtained
trim the use of Tanlac, should appeal
very forcibly to you.
Ariong the many strong endorse
ments recently received Is the follow
ing from Mrs. Josephine Harman, a
highly esteemed elderly lady residing
at J.4.1 Ferris street, Dallas, Texas,
who says:
"I am feeling much better in every
ay than I have in years and it's all
because of what Tanlac has done for
me. Before I began taking it, I couldn't
eat anything but what my stomach
would fill up with gas and cause mo
all kinds ot misery. My appetite was
so poor I seldom wanted anything to
cat rnd I had severe headaches and
pains in the back of the neck. I was
constipated and irregular much of the
time. I also had rheumatism so bad
in my feet and ankles at times I could
hardly get about. My kidneys both
ered me a great deal and the small of
my back hurt me so I could hardly
bend over. In fact, I was In an awful
fix and while I doctored and tried
many different medicines nothing
seeniea to help me.
"I kept reading and hearing so much
about Tanlac that I decided to try it
j and I can see now I made a mistake
: in not getting it before. My .appetite
I picked up and I began to rest better
! at night right away. So I kept on tak
ing Tanlac and Improving right along
until l'ow I can eat anything and en
joy it, and all my pains and other dis
tressing feelings are gone. I sleep fine
now, get up in the mornings feeling
good and its been a long time since I
blcpt well before. Tanlac has made
me feel a whole lot younger and I can
tin 1.11 mv hniiRPwnrk and feel Rtrnnz
! enough to do more. I'm telling every
body how well I feel since taking Tan

DOUGLAS FAIRBANKS
AT CENTRAL THEATRE
Douplas Fairbanks, who plays th9
leading role in the Triangle feature,
'Reggie Mixes In," at the Central thea
tre today, yielded to the persuasion of
film magnates when he was told they
would let him dc all the wild stunts
he wanted to. "The Lamb" was the
mildest sort of starter. In it, he had to
have a rattlesnake crawl over him, and
hat. to encounter a savage wolf and a
ferocious mountain lion face to face,
jiu Jitfui three Indiana armed with
knives, 6oar In an aeroplane and oper
ate a machine gun.
In "Reggie Mixes In" he outdoes all
previour startling performances, with
a fipht in which he wrestles, falls,
crawl ctAPper nnrt Tilunppa thrnuch
i fifteen minutes of physical combat
with V E. Lowery, an actor of power
ful physique, who gives the athletic
young star a tussle of very evident
reality. Fairbanks comes out of the
battle with a goodly portion of his
clothes missing, and with his well-
known good looks entirely missing.
tut a joyous victor nevertheless.
