(By Review Leased Wire).
WASHINGTON, Mar. 1. Heads
of the country's leading railroad
systems met here today with the
council of national defense to ap
prove plans for giving the govern
ment the full cooperation of
transportation interests in the
event of war. They came at the
call of Daniel Witlard, president
of the Baltimore A. Ohio, and a
member of the council's advisory
committee of seven. Tonight they
were returning home to work out
cooperation details with com
manders of the country's four
military departments.
The executives present a council on

After a call on Secretary Baker the
railroad mm heard army officers on
transportation problems and then dis
cussed the situation among themselv

Secretary Baker told them the trans

important the military will face. Of
the country's state of defense, be
said:

"We have gone on in thin country
for a Ion? time in the somewhat com

Ocean is 3.000 miles wide, the Pacific
15,000 or something like that, and that
we are separated by nature as well as
by traditions and our own desires
from any sort of difficulty. But we
have grown a lot wiser in the last few
years on that general subject; and
w-bile I a" quite sure that you regard
the state of peace as most desirable,
we are nevertheless concerned as to
the means of accomplishing its con

Moving of guardsmen to the Mexi

WASHINGTON, Mar. 1. With Re
publican leaders joining the Demo
crats in suppressing dilatory tactics,
and hopes high for avoiding an extra
session of congress, the Senate ad
journed near midnight tonight under
an agreement to vote finally on the
$500,000,000 naval bill at four o'clock
tomorrow afternoon.
There still were some Republican
senators insisting upon an extra ses
sion wbo refused to concede that the
army and sundry civil appropriation
measures and the conference report
on the postoffice bill would be permit
ted to pass.
The armed neutrality bill is to be
taken up early tomorrow morning.
Republicans, it was declared, were in
duced to yield their filibuster on the
naval bill through patriotic motives
and on account of the reply of tbe
President to the Senate resolution

(By Review Lased Wire)
PHOENIX. March 1. The house
this morning put the. general approie
riation bill through and sent it to the
senate. A bill wss introduced in the
house by Mr. Flake for the abolition
of the Tempe normal school and the
transfer of the property of the school
to the University. The Vaughn bill
establishing a municipal civil service
system was indefinitely postponed.
The principal event of the day was
the favorable recommendation of the
whole committee of the house, of the
McKay minimum wage bill for women.
It vac amenrirtft hv rpduHnir the min
imum wage from $12 to $10 a week.
The house refused to accept the sen
ate amendment tv the "red light"
abatement bill, consisting of the addi
tion of a referendum clause.
The senate passed a bill prohibiting
the use or sale of wood alcohol for
any purpose. It also passed a bill
prohibiting the sale of or manufacture
of tulapai, tis-wine or corn beer by
Indians.
The senate committee of the whole
recommended for passage the creation
of a school for the deaf, dumb and
blind, but amended the bill by strik
ing out a reference to the proposed
site, the old experimental farm near
Phoenix. The most important work
of the senate of the day was favorable
action by the senate Of the country
classification bill which divides the
counties into five classes and fixes the
salaries of county officers in all of
them.

bill.
I The Democrats, it was said, would
'be satisfied with the passage of the
naval and armed neutrality bills,
hopeful that the President would call
an extra session of congress late in
the spring or early in the summer to
clear up the rest of the appropriation
tangle If indeed the international de-
, velopment might not require a special
session earlier than that time.
I Before negotiations for an agree
ment on the naval bill were begun.
Senator Swanson appealed to Repub
lican leaders to desist from what he
believed to be obstructive tactics to
1 prevent passage of the measure. Ma
ny questions asked by Senator Weeks
and Lodge regarding minor items
prompted his statement.
Senators Weeks and Lodge flm-
claimed any intention to filibuster and
said they hoped the bill would pass
before adjournment.
"But," added Senator Lodge, "there
Is a very strong sentiment on this
side, with which I am in sympathy,
that congress ought to be in session
soon after March 4. Congress ought
not to be temporarily abolished, in
this grave situation the whole gov

ought to bo here. I am not aware of
any filibuster against this bill."

BUENOS AIRES. March 1. The

caused stupefaction everywhere.
EI Diario, commenting on the revela
tion of the German plot says:
"Carranza certainly knew Of the
German proposal before his dispatches
of felicitation to the German emperor,
which indicates he was not adverse to
the idea. However, the proposal had
no basis. Germany is bankrupt, and
offered doubtful financial aid.
"The Germans misunderstood Japan
if they supposed such a grotesque piO
position possible. It has served to ex
pose the German movement against
the United States and has opened the
eyes of the American congressmen,
who now will give President Wilson
the necessary powers to defend the
country efficaciously against an ad
versary unworthy Of consideration."

WASHINGTON, March 11
Aroused by the disc losure of Ger
many's plot to unite Japan anil
Mexico with her in a war upon

vinced by. official evidence of Its
authenticity, congress today aban
doned the delays and obstructions
which have checked President

with the submarine menace.
Bill Only Half Good
The house, after a ten-hour de
bate and by an overwhelming
majority, passed a bill to empow
er the President to arm merchant
ships and providing for a hundred
million dollar bond issue. The
bill, however, does not contain
the grant of authority to use "oth
er instrumentalities" which the
President specifically desires and
would prevent government war
insurance for munitions ships, a
prohibition which the President
does not approve.. '
Senate to do Better
When the house bill hi received
in the senate tomorrow, the sen
ate bill which the administration
fully commends, will be substitut
ed, and that is expected finally to
be accepted y both houses as the
law.
Official announcement was made at
the White House today that the ad-

its provision for "other instrumental
ities." In the senate an attempt to
ask the President to disclose the gov
ernment's source of information of

co and Japan on tbe supposition that
it came from one of Germany's ene

WASHINGTON. Mar. 1. Count
von Bernstorff, the former German
ambassador, was instructed from Ber
lin to arrange the dismantling of Ger
man war-bound ships in American
harbors at the same time he received
the Zinimermaun note for transmis

This additional thread in the mesh
of German intrigue spun around this
country, while Germany was still pro
testing friendship, was allowed to be
come known today with the inference
that full and detailed instructions
were sent BernstorlT from Berlin to
make war by this country impossible.
They refused to disclose any other
elements in the German plot but in
dicated that it was general and whole
sale. The next step expected from
abroad is a complete statement by
Mexico of her attitude. Despite the
long chain of suspicious circumstanc
es tending to connect that country
with Germany s intrigues, officials ex
pect an indignant repudiation by tbe
Carranza government
It is assumed also that Japan wilt
take advantage of the opportunity to
reaffirm her loyalty to the entente
and her friendship for this country.
The text of the German instructions
have been shown to the Japanese am

myself that he holds me in higher

Senator Stone concluded by saying

was adopted without a record vote.
Senator Fall. Republican, bitterly
denounced the Democrats for their at

Democratic senators by suggesting

Pathe Gold Rooster Photoplay
Is Featured Today and
Tonight at the Royal.
One of the most charming screen
stars engaged for the l'athe Gold
K'joster program is Miss Mollie King,
who is featured with William Courte
nay in "Kick In," to be shown at the
Royal theatre today.
Mollie King was born in New York
City on April 18, 198. "My first stage
appearance was at the age of eight
months and I've been on the stage
ever since," she says.
She played in several Broadway suc
cesses and was a feature at the Win
ter (jerden after a two year tour of
the Orpheuui Vaudeville Circuit where
.lu- and her sisttr, Nellie, did a sister
;u i. She lias been starred in several
of the productions jf the World Film
( orpi'ration and is well known to mo
lion picture audiences throughout the
country.
yis'j King is of fair complexion with
r -i'Jish blond hair and hazel eyes.
She weighs 115 pounds and has a face
Allien in addition to being beautiful,
is mobile that it can express any
?:uotion that a human countenance
f-r.n register and still retain its beauty.
M iss King can sing and dance eharni
ii;iy as millions of vaudeville fans
throughout the country can attest.
"After leaving school, I acted as un
derstudy for Elizabeth Brice, in the
musical comedy 'The Winsome Wi
dow,' playing her star's part on many
occasions." Miss King continued. "I
was then 15 years old. Afterwards I
played a season in vaudeville with
my sister Nellie, filled an engagement
with the passing slow at the Winter
Garden, and then supported Sam
Bernard in 'The Belle of Bond
Street:' "
Miss King comes from a theatrical
family. Her brother Charles King is
known throughout the world as a
member of the famomi team of Brice
and King, and her sister Nellie is a
vaudeville artist.-
The state corporation commission
will probably issue an order within
the next two weeks for a sleeper on
the night trains between Douglas and
Phoenix, as the result of a vigorous
campaign conducted by the Warren
District Commercial Club, the Doug
las Chamber of Commerce and other
organizations, mis miornniion was
contained in a letter from the corpor
ation commission rend at the meet
ing of the board of directors of the
commenial club Wednesday evening.
About two weeks ago Dr. Bledsoe,
representing the club, '-presented to
the commission a number of petition
signed by scores of travelling men.
urging that, an order for a sleeper be
issued. The petitions were circulated
in this vicinity by Secretary Billy
Delbridge of the club, 'who has been
one of the most active workers on the
plan.
The commercial club directois rec
ommended to the board of supervis
ors, at the meeting Wednesday night,
that the road between Don Luis and
Naco be put in, first-class condition at
once. Travel over this road is unus
ually heavy, and the highway Is paid
to be in bad shape. The board of di
rectors also recommended that the
Double Adobe road, between the rail
road and Forrest Station, be worked
over. This action was taken at the
request of Sulphur Springs valley
ranchers, who presented a petition
urging the improvement work.
The proposed paving of Subway Al
ley was also taken up and the follow
ing property owners appointed mem
bers of a committee to confer with
the city council on the matter: Chas
McDonald, Sam Frankcnburg anc'
Georce Heneger.
Secretary Delbridge was instructed
to write an article on various trips
out of Bisbee for publication in Motor
Age. The magazine has requested
such an article, to be accompanied by
aa illustrated map. The map will be
prepared by City Engineer McNeish.

REFUSES TO TURN j
COCHISE RESIDENT ;
OVERTO OFFICERS
Gov. Campbell Turns Down
Request That Extradition
Papers Ce Issued for Man
Wanted in Wyoming.
Governor Tom Campbell has turned
down the request of Cheyenne offic
ers that be issue extradition papers
for William II. Frazce, whom the Wy
oming officials claim is -wanted in
that titate on an old charge. Frazee
came to Cochise county about four
years ago. it is said, and secured
work on th" HiHid ranch in Pu''nr
Sprinc-? vallev. In hs new position
Frazce gained the friendship and le
spect of evervone with whom he rn:ne
in contact. . Two years aeo Cheyenne
officer:? asked Governor Hhni to Issue
extradition panels for Frazce In or
der P'nt t!cv mifbt Tirosnci'te hi"' n
the old ch.ine. This' wr.s denied.
Soon after the sufifyne court plac
ed Mr. Canbell in fbe trovernor's
chair, the Wyoming officials again p.t
tcmtited to have him turned over to
them. Governor Campbell investigat
ed the case and found that Fin zee's
life in Cochise had been straight and
that he was as respected and trusted
as any man in the county. The gover
nor then turned down the Wvoming
officers, expressing the belief that to
turn Frazce over to them on the old
chrrgo would be little short of perse
cution. The fact that a reward was
offered for his arrest, on the ancient
charge, is believed to be the motive
that is impelling the Cheyenne offic
ers in their endeavor to extradite
Frazee.

GERMAN INTENTIONS.
Since the great blaze in Europe started there have
een many people in the United States, well advised on
11 of the phazes of the Continental situation, who de
lared that the welfare of America was wrapped up with
lat of the Allies, and particularly with Great Britain
nd France. The great majority of the people of this
ountry, however, have been neutral 'in thought and in
icf and many have firmly believed Germany and Austria
ere being made the footballs of Great Britain's jealousy,
his is not counting the large number of Americans w ho
re either of German or English parentage. But it is
ard to conceive, at the present time, how any man or
oman, who calls himself or herself an American, can

THE LAST STRAW.
A certain woman in Bisbee receives letters from rela
tives in Germany. Of late these letters have been dv
ieted until the reading matter has been reduced to a
minimum. In the last letter which she received, a post
cript read: "Save the envelope, it might be an inter
esting souvenir."
The Bisbee lady was curious and decided to investigate
the envelope thoroughly. She steamed the stamp and
after it had been lifted from its place, in plain writing
but small, she read: "Germany is slowly starving to
death".
Judging by all of the information which is leaking out
of the Central countries this is in no way overdrawn.
Germany is actually starving. As a last resort Prussia

"Peace and good will between the United States and

TROUBLES.
It never rains but it pours. Troubles are heaping tip
on Uncle Sam. From every point of the compass except
the north, he faces danger.
It's bad enough to be on the verge of a conflict with
Germany. It doesn't add to our ease of mind to "have
the Japanese immigration problem become acute again at
this particular time. Mexico we have always with us,
and ill-natured Mexican pranks we are used to; but we
might have been spared Carranza's acceptance of the
German propaganda, his hypocritical plea for an Ameri
can embargo on munition shipments and his open affilia
tion with German army officers.
It looks as if Mexico may develop into a frank ally of
Germany. At best, the Mexican menace will keep a larg
part of our military forces busy and tie up resources that
could lie used to better advantage elsewhere.
And then comes Cuba. That delightfully irresponsible
island seems to have no animus against us. It has be"'i
freed by Uncle Sam, and pacified by him twice, and
doesn't iniud being pacified a third time. But how up
fortunate that the job should loom up just now! There's
much ground for thinking that, while Cuba has no love
for Germany, German emissaries have-been at the bot
tom of the disorder attending ,the disputed Cuban elec
tion, and that possibly German money has financed tile
incipient revolt.
We might take care of Germany, Mexico, Cuba and
Japan all together, if we had time enough to prepare.
But they may not be considerate enough to wait.
GOOD SHELLS.
American munition manufacturers are going to have a
fair chance to show what they can do in making shells
for Uncle Sam. The inability of the British firm of Had
fields to fulfill its contract, owing to a government pro
hibition, has' led to au order for 14.1'iK) 14-inch shells be
ing placed with three American firms.
The price is $500 s hcl!t making a total of nearly $'J,

tut the shells may be worth il. if they are deliver d
promptly and are up to bpecilications. For it will mean
that, there arc three American munition firms able to pro
duce shells for our battleship guns as nearly perfect as
any in the world.
Thus far no American firm has shown itself ah! to do
this. All samples submitted to the government have
lnen below the Hadlield's samples. The Midvalc Steel
Company made the bctt Niiowing, with 7:5 per ceut of its

! Bisbee-A jo Secretary Returns
from Seven Weeks Trip
'With Interesting Mory or

Mining and Financial News
BY fltVlFW LEASCD WIRE
Walter Holm, secretary of the Cis-bee-Ajo
Copper company, has returned
1 to this city alter a trip 01 seven weeks,
I upon which he visited practically
j every large city in the east. Mr. Holm
I brought back an interesting story of
! the high cost Of living in the east that
should make ilisbee residents glad
that they are living here instead of in
New York or Chicago.
Holm says that the first night he
was In New York he slept in a Turkish
bath because he could find no other
place. The next day he visited six-
i teen hotels before being able to se
cure a room, and then had to pay
! rates double those of a year 'or so ago.
i He also learned that potatoes are not
included in meals in eastern restau
rants, but are quoted as 13 cents
extra, and that even bread and butter
!are now listed on the menus." Holrfi
I was in New Y'ork during the recent
! food riots and watched mobs of hun
, pry women storm the Hotel Asfor.
Twenty-five thousand extra policemen
have been put on In New Y'ork during
the last few weeks, he declares.
Holm reports that there is a uni
versal fpeling in the east that the
United States will soon declare war
on Germany.
"Folks in Bisbee may complain of
the high cost of living." said Holm,
"but if they were in the east and had
to pay the exhorbitant prices ivr food
prevailing there, they would soon
come to the conclusion that Bisbee is
as cheap a place to live in as any
other in the country."

NEW YORK, Mar. 1 During the
greater part of today's listless session
stocks were under pressure, further
liquidation and short selling being
prompted by the disclosure in respect
to Germany's intrigue to ally Mexico
and Japan against the I'nited States.
I'art recoveries from lowest levels oc
cured in the last hour but numerous
losses of one to three points were
registered at the close. Disappoint
ment was shown at the reduced divi
aends reported by some of active cop
per companies and the failure of
Utah Copper directors to increase the
extra disbursement.
United States Steel, which sold
minus its regular and extra dividends
of three percent, showed an extreme
loss or lMt points at 1:!, but made
up more than half its reversal.
Reading, New York Central, Union
and Canadian Pacific, and Atchison
reflected the heaviness of representa
tive rails. Total sales 432,000 shares.
New low records for some interna
tional issues accounted for general
heaviness of the bond lit. Total
sales, par value, 3,340,000. U. S.

BEFORE BREAKFAST.
Says we will both look and feel
clean, sweet and fresh
and avoid Illness.
SaiiiUiy scLeiue has of late made
rapid strides with results that are of
oM hlessin?
to humanity. The let
est application of its untiring research j
is me recuiuiuruuaLiuu mat ii is
necessary to attend to internal sanita
tion of the drainage system of the hu-
ninn i.t i- a it i In tha Hralna tf t VlO
house. !
Those of us who are accustomed to I
feel dull and heavy when we arise
splitting headache, stuffy from a cold,
foul tongue, nasty breath, acid At.itu
ach. can. instead, feel as fresh a a
daisy by opening the sluices of the
system each morning and flushing out
the whole of the internal pois'onous
stagnant matter.
Everyone, whether ailing, sick or
well, should, each morning before
hrp:ilffat rlrink a fl:isi nf rul hnt I
water with a ttraspoonful of limestone ;
phosphate iu it to wash from the stom-;
ach. liver and b'jwels the previous
j day's indigestible waste, sour bile aud '
! poisonous toxins; thus cleansing,
sweetening and purifying the entire
ilinu-ntary canal before putting more
food into the stomach.
The action of
hot water and limestone phosphate on
in empty stomach is Wonderfully in-
igorating. It cleans out all the sour
fermentations, gases, waste and acidity
iiid gives out a splendid appetite for
breakfast. While you are enjoying
your breakfast the phophated hot
water is quietly extracting a large vol
ume of water from the blood and get
ting ready for a thjroui;h flushing of
ill the inside orsans.
The millions of people who are both
ered with constipation, bilious spells.
.;tomach trouble, rheumatic stiffness:
others who have sallow skins, blood
lisorders and sickly complexions are
urged to get a quarter pound of lime- j

you can wear It with the assurance that you are perfect'y fined and
