WASHINGTON'. Aug. 4.The Cum
mins bill to restore the rate making
poweis of the interstate commerce
commission during the remaining pe
riod of federal control was reported
out today by the house interstate com
merce committee by a vote of 6 to 5.
The measure which already has
passed the senate, was amended by
the committee in one important re
spect, in that it would confer on state
commissions the same authority over
intrastate rates that the federal body
now has over interstate rates.
Chairman Esch said that the wide
spread demand from carriers that the
interstate commerce commission be
given its former right to fix rates
through outhority to approve and sus
pend those initiated by carriers as
provided in the bill, was due largely
to the present uncertainty over the
whole question of freight tariffs.

L It demands the "gequine. coKJPera'
tion and partnership based on a real
community of interest' an4 'participa
tion in control" of which President
Wilson spoke to congress and which
the statement says, has been "ignored
by labor and the private ownership
of the railroads."
"We ask," it says, "that the rail
roads of the United States be vested
in the public; that those actually
engaged In conducting that industry,
not from Wall street but from the
railroad offices and yards, and out on
the railroad lines, shall take charge
of this service for the public."
Briefly labor's plan demands: that
- private capital be eliminated from the
railroads; that the private owners re
ceive for than vrnment bonds
' "with a fixed interest return for ev
ery honest dollar that they fcave in
vested;" that the tripartite control,
heretofore referred to, be established
'in a corporation which shall lease the
roads, and in which the public, the
operating managements and labor
shall be represented equally; that
"the public, the operators and the
wage earners share equally all rev
enue in excess of th guarantee to
, private capital, by granting to the
operators and the employes one-half
the savings which are expected to be
made by such a perfected organization
and to the public the other half as
consumers, either by increasing serv
ice without adding costs or by reduc
ing costs."
"'This role originates with labor,"'
says the statement, "because labor
happens to have a firm organization
through which it may become a real
ization." -
According to the constant stream of
letters received by Chief of Police
Kempton, Arizona might well be term
ed tne vort of missing men .and
also women. Seldom a day passes
that he does not receive a letter from
some anxious relative inquiring as to
the whereabouts of a son, uncle,
brother or, perhaps. Just a friend.
They all seem to come to Arizona
and then forget there was ever such a
place as the ea6t and even Califor
nia. .
The latest missing man to be re
ported to Chief Kempton is an absen
tee of 10 years named George Sturg
ess, supposed to be about 80 years of
age, and last heard from a decade
ago in Arizona.
'His niece, Emma E. Sturgess ' of
Glendale, Calif., is making anxious
inquiries for" him. He was a miner
and may have wandered into some of
the Arizona mining camps.
Another missing . relative is Richie
Valine, a young woman of Calexico,
Calif. Miss Semasco Campbell is
making inquiries for her, but failed
to enclose a description.
The chief stated yesterday it is a
hard job to locate missing people in
Arizona, due to the fact that when
the average delinquent leaves his na
tive hearth he invariably changes his
name. According to police usage still
in vogue In many of the mining camp3
of the state, it is not good form to in
quire as to a person's right name, thus
making, identification hard and leav
ing relatives still on the anxious list.

Fred Bechdoldt, well known
writer, both in fiction and in
facts, arrived in Tombstone yes
terday and will remain here for
several days, during wr-ich" time
he will gather data and material
for a story on Tombstone, dating
back from the early days when
Ed Schieffelin first set foot here,
until the present day.
The story will appear in the
Saturday Evening Post, the au
thor having been especially as
signed to Tombstone by that'
magazine. Mr. Bechdoldt is no
stranger to Tombstone, having
visited the old camp two years
ago to obtain local color for a
fiction story", on which he is at
present at work. While there he
remained as the guest of Sheriff
Harry C. Wheeler, an old time
friend, and obtained considerable
data for his story.'
At that time he entertained an
idea of a special story on Tomb
stone whose history would fill a
book and 'finally succeeded in
making arrangements with the
Saturday Evening Post for a spe
cial article, the data for which
there is only one Tombstone in
the world could furnish for the
history of its early days is a story
complete in itself, as depicted by
Alfred Henry Lewis, in "Wolf
ville Tales."
Mr. Bechdoldt does not intend
to go into detail, however, merely
covering the facts as concerning
the old camp. He is being as
sisted in the collection of the data
by the Tombstone Commercial
Club and by Judge J. F. Duncan
and a number of the pioneers
who will furnish him with events
and dates of their happenings as
they actually occurred. Following
. his visit, here the author intends
to spend some weeks in writing
the story and it will appear in the
Post at a near future date.

BENSON BRIDGE H
ISHEOIW;
LOSS $28,000
During the severe flood which raged
down the San Pedro Sunday as the
result of phenomenal rains in the dis
trict drained by the San Pedro river,
the Benson-Dragoon concrete bridge
was completely washed from Its moor
ings and the structure collapsed into
the tortfent & total loss.
The bridge was completed last year,
at a cost of over $28,000, and was a
re-inf breed concrete, two-span Luton
arch type structure, and had so far
withstood the onslaughts of torrential
waters that swept down the stream,
until Sunday morning, when a chang
ing in the channel threw the entire
force of the water against Jhe center
piers which- collaps"ed and hundreds
of tonte of concrete went down.
County Engineer Smith, who had a
force of men at work trying to divert
the water in its proper channel, was
en route to the bridge, when he learn
ed at St. David of the loss. He will
go there to make arrangements for1
the diversion of traffic over the St.
David bridge, opening up an old road
down this side of the river to connect
with the Dragoon road.
The board of supervisors are ex
pected, to take action for rebuilding
of the bridge, which is a complete loss
It is possible the abutment on the
Benson side may be saved, but until
the county engineer investigates this
will not be known. ...
The bridge had been built to fill
a long felt want or the farmers and
people of that district.
Striking cigar makers deny respon
sibility for increased prices. Perhaps
they can explain how wages can go up
and prices down.

Lively Rattlesnake
Entertains Crowd
J. B. Williams, of the Central Drug
company, and Fred Johnson qualified
as snake doctors at Mr. William's
pharmacy last night, to the enter
tainment of a crowd that filled the
store and blocked the sidewalk. The
? reptile operated upon was a lively
-: rattler about four feet long, and with
seven rattles and a button.
Earlier in the day Mr. Williams and
Mr. Johnson had caught .the snake on
the prairie about three miles below
town, using only a common walking
cane. They brought it to Eisbee,
where the operation of removing its
fangs watf performed.
After it had been rendered harm
less the snake was placed in the show,
window. Still full of '"pep," It es
caped when the window was left
open a few inches and, springing into
the crowd gathered, around, caused a
general ecatterment. The snake was
recaptured and placed in the window.
Rattlers are said to be unusually'
plentiful around Bisbee this year.

which time he will thoroughly inves

with a view of taking over some local

who wish to develop at the present
high price of silver. Mr. Carney, while
spending over 20 years in Arizona
has never visited that district, but
owing to the demand forv silver prop
erties naturally turned to Tombstone,
where he intends to at least find one
property to place at the disposal of
his Interested capital, and has already
been 'placed in touch with local peo

claims awaiting capital. Mr. Carney
believes i from first hand Information

is merely in its infancy with regard
to development, and says he is confi

mark, where it will. remain for. years,
the Tombstone district is bound to
forge to the front with new produc

owners ht properties who have been
unable to prosecute . development

SENATOR C. M. ROBERTS.
Roberts, of this county, ia clipped from the Prescott Courier
of August 2nd:
"Former State Senator C. M. Roberts, of Cochise county,
accompanied by former State Senator Homer R. Wood, were welcome
callers at the Courier office last Sunday. The Courier felt honored by
the presence of these two very representative citizens, good men and
Democrats. In reply to a direct question made by.the Courier man.
Senator Roberts said that he is an aspirant for the Democratic nomina
tion to be governor of Arizona at the coming primary election in
this state. No abler, more worthy or more representative citizen
and Democrat will be an aspirant for that honor. , Senator Roberts
is a big, strong and determined man, strong both physically and
mentally. His reputation for courage and unflinching devotion to
duty is unquestioned. What is needed in a governor of a great state
is clearness of vision, honesty of purpose, and , the courage to carry
out that purpose, and Senator Roberts ha3 all ot these. He is an
Arizonan from the ground up. which also means a man typical of the
west, from the ground up. May their tribe ever, increase. It gives
us much satisfaction to know from first hands that we have so suit
able a man. in our list of aspirants for this most important position
in the gift of the people of this 6tate. As a pilot who takes the great
ship through calm aud storm is the man who is governor of a state;
upon his virility, judgment and coolness of head, backed by bravery,
depends the safety of the people. It is a most important position,
and one which only a man of unquestioned physical as well as moral
courage can properly fill. - We must have, such a man for this posi
tion, aad Senator Roberts is one such man in the field for the posi
tion! and this is said in no disparagement of any other aspirants..
Politically Senator Roberts is and has been a winner. He is at
present one cf the capable county supervisors of Cochise couaty. He
has over been a leader. - He was a member of our constitutional con
vention and was elected to the first and third Arizona state senates.
Should he be nominated, he will be elected governor of this state
by a big majority. There is no question about this at all."
THE SALVATION ARMY.
THERE HAS BEEN a big change in the public attitude to
ward the Salvation Army since the first decade or two of
its activities in America. In the beginning it suffered little
short of persecution; It wai the butt of hooligans in the
cities. It was considered the height of slum and small-town humor
to heave a rotten vegetable at the bass drummer. Merchants pro
tested against its street meetings and sometimes obtained prohibi
tion by ordinance. Even some of the churches deemed the work ot
the army as a species' of emotional ;and'' questionable evangelism.
Others looked upon it with amused tolerance.
But the practical character of the Christianity of the Salvation
Army slowly dawned upon the public. Wherever vice flourished and
misfortune prevailed there it set up its banners and waged its war.
The down-and-out man or woman learned. that there was help and
comfort to be had from the Salvation Armyand no questions asked.
It established workingmen's hotels children's homes, rescue and
maternity homes, nursery shelters, slum posts, farm colonies. It
engaged in prison work and offered not only prayers but advice,
assistance in discharge and situations after discharge. It established
an unusual Christmas celebration for the poor and provided dinners,
clothing and toys.
The early estimation that the Salvation Army was a joke or a
fanaticism had passed away ere the world wai began. but probably
until it entered upon its war service the be&f understanding of its
ideals and unselfishness existed among the folk "to whom it admin
istered. But in France more than 2,000,000 young Americans were
made acquaiited with the same type of fearlessness that had stood
Salvation Army lasises in stead when they entered the enemy saloons
with their tambourines. It was a different peril in France, but it
was faced as unflinchingly, as uncomplaiuingly and with the same
lack of thought of material reward. Two million young men ot all
classes now acclaim the organization.
So the Salvation Army has . proceeded on its way cultivating a
material soil for implanting the seeds of its doctrines. Thus it has
won its place against great odds. Thus it has gained the esteem and
confidence of the people. There are -countless persons whose charity
or benevolence is restrained by lack. of knowledge as to how to go
about dispensing it. The Salvation Army knows. . Money placed in
its hands lifts the fallen, makes the world better for the unfortunate,
brightens life for the physically or morally exhausted. It is the great
medium for reaching and alleviating the lowest depths of misery.
GOVERNMENT NEWSPAPERS,
(Arizona Gazette)
WILLIAM J. BRYAN suggests that "some day all news will
be issued through government channels, and will have
the approval of the proper authorities before it is
printed."'
Mr. Bryan will probably have trouble in winning any large num
ber of American citizens to his point of view. If there is one principle
which, more than any other, characterizes American institutions and
express the American attitude toward public affairs, it is freedom
of the press.
American newspapers have their faults, as editors know only
too well. But generally speaking, these faults are the "defects of
their virtues" they merely represent the over-doing of things which
are in themselves too valuable to be sacrificed. ' '
This fact was so clearly recognized during the war that there
was no censorship imposed on the American press, In the European
sense. Whatever censorship existed was voluntary. It was the only
instance of the kind on record. The newspapers censored themselves.
And they did it so thoroughly and honestly that the government pro
fessed itself more than satisfied.
The government itself did undertake to guide the newspapers by
issuing during the war, a publication giving an official version of
the Washington news. Anybody who wanted it could get it. It never
attained any great circulation or any great influence. The people
preferred to get the war news,' like other news, from daily papers
fami'.iar with their life and wants, and experienced in giving it to
them. Apparently tho people feel still more that way in normal times.
It would be a fine, varied, complete, human, interesting news
paper, wouldn't it, if everything in it had to be submitted to govern
ment censors before it saw the light of day!

LOS ANGELES,' Aug. 4. A relic of
i their barbaric - past, yet such a part
I of thpir tribal j existence that it can
J not be discarded,- he .annual snake
dance of the HCpi Indians will be held
mis year August 20 and September 6
at the.Hopl Indian reservation in
Eastern Arizona, according to an an
nouncement made here recently.
The ceremonies surrounding the an
nual festival are so weird and barbaric
that thousands of tourists and pleas
ure seekers, bored by the common
place and seeking something different,
pay the Hopi reservation a visit.
Preceding the snake dance, which
continues for nine days, the Indians
hold a musical concert, participated
by two bands, equipped only with
flutes. After playing several selec
tions, the music ends with a footrace.
When the snake dance starts, war
riors of the tribe are dispatched to the
desert to bring in the reptiles. They
are accompanied by musicians whose
performances on quaint musical in
struments are supposed to lure the
snakes into the hands of the warriors.
After capturing several snakes, gen
erally,, rattlers, the warriors re
turn to the village where the reptiles
are placed in stone jars. Incantations
accompanied by music and weird'
dances around the jars then continue
for nine days. '

ENGINEERS CONDEMNS
IRRIGATION PROJECT
PRESCOTT, Aug. 4. In view of a
report recently compieted by Homer
Hamlin, consulting engineer of the
United States reclamation service it
is doubtful it the .proposed storage
dam for the irrigation of 95,000 acres
in Paradise and Deer valleys, near
the mouth of the Verde river, will
ever be built.
The plans call for the construction
of a dam, a few miles below Camp
Verde and the creation of a lake
which, at its high stage, would extend
up the river to a point about half a
mile this side of .that settlement.
Much local interest exists in the Paradise-Verde
project, not only because
it would bring 95,000 acres of extreme
ly rich land under cultivation, but also
because the lake, only 25 miles from
Jerome, would provide splendid fish
ing and waterfowl hunting for sports
men of this section.
Hamlin declares that the supply of
water from the Verde river available
for Paradise and Deer valleys is not
sufficient for 30,000 acres, and he sees
j no chance for the development of a
supplemental underground supply. He
declares further that the impounding

Arata is hopeful that before the cam

located a formation in which it will

All the holes being drilled are cross-

of Arizona. From Lordsburg west the
range has recently been visited by
heavy rains, and the result is a blan
ket of verdure that makes the coun
try for miles and miles seem like one
large lawn.
As far west as. ochise the plains
are covered with nothing but grass,
with very little brush, and
no trees to obstruct the view.
From Cochise to a few miles
east of Tucson the country changes
to hills and arroyos, and the brush
and cactus are thick, with a luxuriant
growth of edible waeds. About Tuc
son jnd for miles north the landscape
again changes, .and one of the most
wonderful niesquite growths any
where in the country exists. The
green leafy branches of one bush in
tertwine with another until passage
through the jungle seems an impos
sibility. A slrange feature' is the fact that
the usually vegetable growth does not
extend very far into New Mexico.
Somehow the rains which have caused
southern Arizona to spring into a
spiingtime radiance seem to have
avoided utterly the sister staie on the
east. There the brown plains are

"Oh, You Arizona.'
Sung In California
Hassayampa Day
"I love you California, but Oh, You
Arizona!" was the song of songs
when Hassayampa day, the annual
get-together of all Arizonans who may
be sojourning in California either as
visitors of expatriates, was celebrated
at Venice Thursday. Mrs. Dave Fos
ter wis among the Bisbee people
present and, according to a letter her
husband has received from her, the
Arizonans had a fine, large celebra
tion, with about 3,000 members pres
ent. One feature of the day was a
speech by Norman Johnson which
got "under the hides" of the Holly
wood motion picture colony.
An address of welcome was made
by the president, Mrs. Linda Scolt.
wno spoke from the bandstand. She
was followed by Judge John J. Hawk
las, of Prescott, who tpoke of the
invigorating helpfulness of people of
one state coming together after the
trials and separations caused by the
war. He urged the people of Ari
zona and California to force upon
their senators tho great necessity of
confirming the League of Nations,
which he called the greatest thing
since the birth of Christ.
Norman Johnson, who spoke next,
described the wonderful changes that
prohibition had brought in Arizona.
He congratulated California on her
adoption of prohibition. He said that
one of the things that had impressed
him most in this state is its beautiful
women and (impressively) its beauti
ful men.
"If the lovely, dainty, painted-up
doll-men whom I have seen in Cali
fornia should walk throUgh the
streets of an Arizona town they
would be mobbed" he declared.
George W. P. Hunt, ex-governor of
Arizona, at present living in Redondo
Beach, declared that Arizona has one
of the greatest standards of citiren
ship in the United States a citizen
ship born of great vicissitudes and
sacrifice during the days of the strug
gle to build up that state.
After lunch, which was served on
the tables near the 'water, a special
program was provided by the Venice
of America hand, which played some
old and new Arizona airs, ringing in
some of those of California. '
At 3 o'clock a dance for the kiddies
of Arizona and Venice took place.
From 2 until 7 p. m. half rates to all
concessions were granted to people
wearing the Arizona badge. From 7:3i
until 12 p. iu. the members of the
Hassayampa society danced at the
Venice pavilion.
Mrs. Lida Scott is president of tho
society and C. H. Wild is secretary.
Vice presidents are Captain Charles
A. .Montgomery, Judge John J. Hawk
ins and Mrs. Julia Cunningham.
To Probe Charges
Against Attorney
In the superior court at Tombstone,
Judge A. C. IrfK-kwond yesterday ap
pointed five members of the Cochise
county bar to investigate the charges
preferred against W. K. Abraham, an
attorney of Douglas, for alleged pro
fessional misconduct. The complaint
was filed by Col. Johnson, alleging un
professional and unethical conduct on
the part of Abraham, and Judge
Lockwood appointed Harry E. Pickett
anJ A. M. Smc ot Douglas. John E.
Sanders, E. J. Flannigau of Bisbee
uid O. Gibson of Tombstone to in
vestigate. The filing of the charges by Col.
Johnsou is the second episode in tjie
action taken against Abraham when
last week the military authorities re
fused to allow a service of civil
papers upon (ol. llawkius in Canjp
Harry J. Jinn, for alleged libelous
statements. The matter ill stand
until the investigation committee
of members of the bar renders its
report to the court.
Many a man would trade his educa
tion for the financial success ot an
"ignorant idealist." it is to be itared.

Nothing Like Plain Bitro-Phosphate to

According to a noted French Scien
tist, the most effective remedy for
nervousness, - insomnia and ailments
due to depleted nerve force, is a form
of organic phosphate known among
druggists in this country as Bitro
Phosphate. It is described as a substance which
is similar in composition to the. phos
phorus naturally found in brain and
nerve cells and, therefore easily and
quickly assimilated, the work of creat
ing nerve force, strength and vigor
begins immediately it is taken into
the human system.
There are many reports of aston
ishing results from its use, some
showing remarkable improvement ev
en in stubborn cases of long" standing
nerve weakness. - As there are many

been split into two hostile camps,
all over a long-standing feud that
has existed between a pedigreed
cat of Persian ancestry and a

BY REVIEW
STOCK8 AND 430NDS
NEW YORK, Aug. 4. The stock
market experienced a drastic down
ward revision of quoted values today,
the entire list yielding as a result of
adverse developments over the double
holiday.
Extensive liquidation which had its
inception in transportations reflected
the extension of the railroad shop
men's strike and the unexpected atti
tude of the railroad brotherhoods.
From rails the decline soon spread
to shippings, steels, equipments, oils,
motors and the several specialties
which recently featured the bullish
operations of pools and cliques, par
ticularly tobaccos and leathers.
Gross declines among rails and
shippings ranged from 3 to 10 points
high grade or dividend-paying shares
evencing no bette rthan secondary or
reorganized properties.
Selling continued ib enormous vol
ume, to the end. Sales, 1,900,000
shares.
The relation of the railroad 'shop
men s strike to leading industrials was
indicated in the case of the U. S. Steel
corporation, some of whose . plants
Were forced to shut down almost com
pletely, Railroad bonds reacted in sympathy
with stocks and other domestic is
sues, as well as international, .were
irregular to heavy. Total sales, par
value, $12,650,000. Old U. S. 'bonds
unchanged.
THE GRAIN MARKETS
CHICAGO,- Aug. 4. Values reeled
wildly downward today in the grain
and provisions markets. Holders of
all the commodities on the list en
gaged in a strenuous effort to unload
quick and thus escape being caught
in the whirl of the movement against
high cost of living. Corn closed flur
ried 4J,ic to 7 c net with September
$1.79 to $1.79i4 and December $1.484
to $1.48. Oats lost 2Vi cents to 3
cents and provisions $1.10 to $2.25.
Heaviest breaks shown at the end
of the day in the corn market were
December delivery which at the last
minute was still falling rapidly, after
having dropped about 25 cents . a
bushel since less than a week ago.
Inasmuch as . the ' December is the
principal future trading equivalent of
the . 1919 corn crop, the shrinkage in
values whlcn has taken place during
the last week might be figured at con
siderably more than half a billion dol
lars. - Actual cash prices for corn
available for immediatede livery, how
ever, have not been cut more than 10

logues were received from one of the

ed in the "Big Five," showing that in
addition to meat and meat products,
the -concern was handling all kinds of
faney groceries, salad oils, canned
goods, etc., leaving out the only things
on 'which -the average grocer loses
money flour and sugar. . The obvious
conclusion Is that the packers are not
only after control of the meat mar
kets, but all branches of the food ln
duslry.. . - . ' - , -
