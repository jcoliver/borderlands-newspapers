Would Raise One-third of
1919 Expenditures by Tax

'By Review Leaner! X"!re)
WASHINGTON". June 6. Secretary
McAdoo today recommended in a let
ter to Chairman Kitchin of the house
ways and means committee that the
new revenue hill he drawn to raise
&,O0,0u.0U0 bv. taxation, one-third I
of the estimated $24,000,000.0(10 expen
ditures in the fiscal year, 1919.
He also recommended that a war
profits tax be established at high rate
to be superimposed upon existing ex
cess profits taxes; that the normal in
come tax on unearned incomes be
raised and that heavy taxation be im
posed on luxuries.
Prepare for Liberty Issues
The suggestions weer given in re
sponse of a letter from Mr. Kitchin
and constitute! an outline of the treas
ury's ideas not only of taxation to meet
the nation s huge war expenses in th?.
future, but of preparing the wav for
fctta;;;
erty bonds are exempt, said the ,
retary will tend to make ihese bonds
better investments and to permit then
to compete with industrials and munic
ipal securities bearing higher rates of
inteerst.
Mr McAdoo made no attempt to
specify the means of carrying out hi.
suggestions in revenue legislation and
did not intimate what articles might
be classed as "luxuries" for heavier
taxation. He stated, however, that in
many cases the present excess profit
taa do not reach real war profits,
for instance where a corporation with
bie earnings made directly out of the
war has also a big over-canitalizatioa,
and. t"erfore, an apparently low rata
of profit.
Maintain Presetn Ratio
After explaining that his estimate of
$24,000,000,000 expenditures in the
fiscal year starting next July 1, is
based on expenditures fn the nast, nnd
a calculation or the rate of increase,
Mr. McAdoo said, it would constitute
unsound financial policy to raise ?20.
000.000,000 of the sum by flotation of
Ijberty loans, to make up the deficit
'that would follow if there were no in
crease in the 14,000.000.000 revenue ob
tainable under existing law.
About one-third of the $12,500,000,
000 or $13,000,000,000 expendtiure this
fiscal year, ending June 30. will come
from taxation and this ratio he sug
gested, should not be reduced.
"If I may offer a suggestion as to !
the ervenue measure, wrote the secre-
tary, "I should recommend :
"(1) That one-third of the cash ex
penditures to be made during the fiscal

These expressions came in the midst
of a sharp debate precipitated by the
reading by Senator Brandeeee. of Con
necticut, of a newspaper editorial crit
icising the navy department for not
earning shipping Of the presence of
the submarines.
Commenting on this. Senators Lew-j
is and Lodge agreed there was no com-r-lnint
against the navy, though they
had vety different theories as to what
possibly d.-ew the submarines to Amer-
ican shores. Senator Lewis said the
attack was invited bv false statements
'n congress and elf.where regarding
the nation's unpreparedness; while
the Massachusetts senator suggested
the "loose brags and boasts" about t' e
number of American troops trans-
poried overseas had contributed to the
apnearance of the raiders.
"tie mis discussion was in pro:
ress Secretary Baker sent to congress
a request for a $16,000,000 appropria-j
tion for sixteen new baloon and air-1
plane stations along the Atlantic and I
gulf coasts, to supplement the army's I
preparations for its part in repelingi
submarine or air attacks. Equipment
for the stations is said to be on hand,

In connection with the warning of

disclosed late today that a radio mes-
sage was sent broadcast by the navv

shipping and shore stations that j
enemy submarines might appear at
anv port slong the Atlantic coast. At
that time, the news that the enemy

GREEN GOODS SPILLED
Now it is not the kind that the gov
ernment is trying to put a stop to the
handling of. but is the kind that the
government is trying to put the stamp
of Increased productcion thereon. It
was vegetables. The Chinaman from
Fairbank had his wagon loaded with
vegetables and was making a sale to
a man on Naco road near the Slag
Pump aGrage, about six o'clock la3t
evening. The team was stanums on
the side of the road hitched tr the
wagon when along comes two jitneys,
one crashes into the other and Ihe
latter hits the team, the team starts
up Naco road, running over the man
purchasing the vegetables and when
near the Brewery Gulch entrance to
the subway, they get even by hitting
another jitney and turn the wagon over
and spill the goods. The wagon was
slightly danjaged and the horses es
caped with a few cuts, while all three
jitneys bear evidence of being in the
affair. The man was not seriously injured.
Gl
TAKES PEAK FROM
SACRAMENTO HILL
They shot the peak off "Sac" Hill
yesterday afternon but wait! That is
hardly the description for this feat.
The fact Is, the peak jijst shivered un
der the sudden' expansion of some
7,000 pounds of powder and Xhen set
tled down on itself, like a man does
when he is stood against the wall
and shot.
The powder was buried ove,- eighty
feet under the peak so that this sec
tion of the hill might be thoroiiRhly
broken up for the steam shovel. But
the full effects will not be apparent
from the roadway until the shovels
work awhile on the mound of debris
that was a P?ak of solid rock yester
day morning.
Many people drove around through
the mine workings behind the hill to
view the "shot," which was fired at
2.30 yesterday afternoon on the dot.
It was an impressive moment, stand
ing there looking at that great peak
outlined against a clear blue sky and
waiting for the blast. Suddenly the
peak seemed to raise a few feet In
the air and wave wildly as though it
were the steeple of a church shaken
by a high wind. Then came the deep
boom of the explosion; then the sud
den settling down of the mass; then
the great clouds of dust that frolled
down the mpuntain like smoke.
Sac Hill will look vastly different
after a few more davs under the shov
els. It's stone cap is gone.
A big crop of forage feed has been
planted in the Sulphur Springs valley
this season, which will insure a lot of
extra stock feed in the Willcox country
this year.

NEW YORK, June 6 Stocks drifted
rather aimlessly during the greater
part of today's dull and uninteresting
session but je-acted one to four points
in the late dealings when support of
the usual favorites was not forthcoming.-
Foreign developments and the war
situation as a whole exerted little ef
fect, business being viewed with furth

were a more potent factor.
Reduction of dividends by several
mining companies was not unexpected
in view of the refusal of the war
board to advance coper p.rires.
Rails were under partial restraint
because of the apprehension expressed
bv important holders of such securi
ties respecting the proposed powers of
the director general and their possible
effect on guaranteed net incomes.
Lowest quotations were registered
in the broader selling of the final hour,
shippings, industrials and specialties,
notably tobaccos, yielding to general
pressure. Sales 530,000 shares.

GRAINS
CHICAGO, June 6. Torrential rains
in Iowa together with resulting floods
did much to bring about sharp ad
vances which took place today in the
ccrn market. Prices closed strong 3
to 3 cents net higher, with .July
J1.35, to $1.35 and August 1.36.
Oats gained to. 16 cents. Provi
sions finished unchanged to 20 cents
lower.
Oats developed strength with corn.
In rovislons the effect of the grain
buK-e was only transient. Before the
session was ended the temporary gains
were more than counter balanced by
weakness of the hog market.

That Bonus Plan
MINING COMPANIES WILL PAY EM
PLOYES BONUS.
(From the Douglas International)
The announcement yesterday by the
Copper Queen and the Calumet and Ari
zona mining companies that hereafter and
dating back to July 1st, last year, all em
ployes of every nationality and in all de
partments would be paid a bonus of $ 1 00
when their emplo3nent has been continu
ous for one year is a fine exhibition of con
sideration for the men who are doing the
work for these industrial organizations.
During the holidays last year substantial
bonuses were paid to all of the employes
who had been with the companies for six
months and one year, respectively.
Here is the answer to the ravings of the
radicals of the state who are continually
howling about the corporations being con
stantly bent on grinding the workingmen
into the dust. These companies have shown
in this fine act that they are considerate of
the increased burdens which have come to
all classes of their employes and have de
sire and willingness to help them in this
emergency. The bonus will come to all
men who continue in the employ of the
companies for one year and then for every
additional year $ 1 0 additional will be add-
ed to the bonus until the annual payment
on this account shall reach $250. Those
who are absent from their jobs on account
of sickness will not have their bonus mon
ey effected by that fact and they may ab
sent themselves by permission of the com
pany without sacrificing their bonus claim.
This action amounts to extra compensa
tion for those who remain faithful to the
enterprises in which they are engaged; it
is a recognition, of the fact that a man "who
stays at work becomes more valuable than
the one who is continually on the go and is
here today and gone tomorrow.
WITHOUT CORPORATIONS WHAT?
(From the Kingman Miner)
A number of the newspapers of Arizona
that pander to the farmers, stockmen and
agitators, are venting their spleen against
the corporations, especially those engaged
in mining. How foolish this propaganda
is can be readily seen by a look over the
situation. Mining pays one-half the tax of
the state; it furnishes close to 70 per cent
of the haulage of the railroads; it has made
possible the operation of business enter
prises that could exist under no other con
dition; it furnishes employment to more
men at better pay than all the other em
ployes of the state; it has been the means
of opening the wilderness and making it
safe for the farmer and stockman; it has
been the great uvilizer and has done mote
for' humanity than all the other producers
Immediately following the decision of
the government not to allow an advance in
the price of copper at this time, the copper
companies of the Warren district an
nounced that the bonu3 given the workers
last January was to be made a permanent
plan. All that is necessary for the employe
to enjoy this benefit is that he have a year's
continuous service to his credit. And there .
is no quibble or technicality or short change
trick in the generous and sincere gift. Reg
ular vacation period, sickness, injury, these,
when in regular certified form, do not bar
participation.
It is simply a cash present for faithful
service that comes at Christmas time, just
when it is needed the most. And best of
all, it is voluntary and it goes on year after
year, dependent upon neither change of
management or conditions. No law or
threat or menace or strike brought about
this announcement. It stands as a simple,
concrete, practical, kindly, sincere 'declar
ation of good faith between operator and
miner, and if it be profiteering and tyranny.
Jet the radical and the agitator and the poli
tician of the baser sort make the most of it.
of the,world. Had rt not been for mining
there would not today be a railroad west
of the Mississippi river, nor would there
have been a great chain of states on the
Pacific coast. Alaska would have been a
terra incognito, given over to snow and ice
and the poor Esquimaux. And what would
Arizona be today were the mining corpora
tion banished from its confines? Even
Governor Hunt, who has been against the
mining companies, made his money from
these self-same companies at Globe. And
today, it is the mining companies and the
miners of Arizona that are furnishing the
sinews of war for the state. Every mining
camp goes over the top in every campaign,
whether it be for Liberty Bonds, Red Cross
or Thrift Stamps. When it comes to the
big donations it is from the mining com
panies or the men who are engaged in min
ing that the money willingly comes. Ari
zona needs them all farmer, stockman,
miner and railroad, corporation and indi
vidual. The fact that some of these little
nincompoops have no stock in a corpora
tion should not blind them to the good that
corporations are doing. We need them,
one and all, n4 matter what line they may
be engaged in. If we are unable to have a
corporation of our own, we should be glad
to note that our neighbor is prospering in
one.
In this issue of the Review is presented
that much mooted picture of Gov. Hunt
between and in the embrace of two of his
wobbly friends. State Senator Winsor, a
Hunt henchman, has sacriligiously likened
this photograph to Christ s crucifixion be
tween two thieves. Another Hunt senator
has declared that it is no one's business with
whom and in what posture the governor
has his picture taken. Maybe not. It is all
in the viewpoint, anyway. Hunt and his
followers see no harm in the governor hug
ging a wobbly before the camera. The wob
blies themselves are proud of it. They had
a cut made from the photo and printed it in
one of their I. W. W. pamphlets. But there
are people in this country and in this state
that do see harm in a chief executive hob
nobbing with traitors and enemies of so
ciety. Anyway, Hunt can deny with his
voice and quibble with his pen about his
real feeling towards the I. W. W., but this
picture shows Hunt in his happiest and
most natural state. The camera does not
lie. It reproduces the just and the unjust;
the ugly and the beautiful; the good and
the bad, as they appear when the shuttter
flashes to expose the sensitive plate. As '
direct and conclusive evidence the camera
has never been successfully assailed, re
voked, disputed or thrown out of court.
This is not the first time by any means
that fair France has been threatened with
destruction by the barbarians. Some fif
teen centuries ago the Mohammedan
hordes overran Europe and half of France
and were only checked and beaten at the
Loire by the brave warriors of Charles Mar
tel, known as Charles the Hammer, at
Tours. France was in worse straits then
than now, and she prevailed then, even as
she will prevail again. Writing of the bat
tle of Tours and its importance to the rest
of the world and to posterity, Gibbon said :
"But for it perhaps the interpretation of the
Korean would how be taught in the schools
of Oxfcrd, and her pulpits might demon
strate to a circumcised people the sanctity
and truth of the revolution of Mohammed."
American soldiers now walk the paths of
glory one thousand years old. We cannot
conceive at this time of the part we elected
to play when we took up arms against the
Hun and sent the flower of our youth to
France. But posterity will view with ear
nest and constant eye the picture of today
and will fix its value in the history of the
world. Consider, our soldiers before Mont
didier hold ground that Charlemagne's
legions held when they took that city from
the German barbarians more than one
thousand years ago.
Bisbee war' workers are making a deep
drive for sale of thrift stamps. Ladies of
. the Red Cross who are selling stamps at the
banks complain of lack of courtesy in some
cases from those approached who have al
ready purchased stamps. Smile, you,
smile, whether you buy or not ! These ladies
are engaged in a trying, unselfish patriotic
work and are entitled to the uttermost of
politeness from all they approach.
George Cicel, chairman of the govern
ment's publicity bureau, is so nearly a so
cialist that he is compelled to deny that he is
one. I le is too close to the line for the job
he holds.

Colorado Firm Closes Deai on
$250,000 Worth of Bonds
on Which They Had Ob
tained an Option.
-Chairman Vance Johnson oC the
board of supervisors was in Tomb
stone yesterday to attend a meeting
of the board of supervisors and the
board of equalization. He brought
back the good word that the clerk of
the board, A. C. Karger yesterday
morning received a telegram from
Keele.r brothers, the Denver capital
ists, that they would, take up the op
tion that they had on $250,000 of the
Cochise county . highway bonds and
wanted the deal closed as soon as pos
sible. With this sale ther now re
mains but 250,000 of the bonds to be
sold. The Phelps Dodge corporation
a few weeks ag purchased a half mil
lion of the bonds,
it is understood that the balance of
the bonds may be purchased by the
; banks of Cochise county and some by
1 private individuals. The bonds draw
5 per cent interest and are a eilt
I edge security. . The board has received
a number of inquiries about them and
there is now but little doutt that th-;y
will be sold before many months.
Willi the money now available for
the proceeding of tlfe work, the coni-
mission intends to rush the operations.

"Everybody Ought to Know
About Tanlac; It Is
Wonderful," Says
Peterson.
Statement after statement is now be
ing made in connection with Tanlac,
the "Premier Preparation," which is
accomplishing sucn remarkable result
throughout tho United States and Can
ada. Arthur Peterson, general man
ager of the mines of the Seven Star
Gold Mining company, Unionville, Nev.
who is spending the winter at the com
pany's offices 212 Main Street, Salt
Lake City, Utah, in relating his ex
perience with the medicine said:
"I can recommend Tanlac as the best
medicine 1 have ever tried, and since
taking it I feel better than 1 have in
years.
Mr. Peterson was born in Salt Lake
City, but lived for six years in El Paso,
where he was captain of companies 5
and 6 of the fire department, end it
was there he realized the wonderful
powers of Tanlac.
"When I began taking Tanlac," Mr.
Peterson continued. "I was all out of
shape, suffering from stomach troubie
so I couldn't eat anything scarcelv
without hurting. me. I had very little
appetite, and the, gas on my stomach
would Dioat me up and Keep me in
misery for hours after meals. I was
constantly taking something for con
stipation, had fearful headaches, an l
was very nervous, Mr rest was very
poor. I was tired all the time, and
would get up in the mornings feeling
as worn out as if I hadn t gone to
bed. This condition had been going on
for three years, and I had gotten to
where I never felt like doing any
thing. "I was then living in El Paso, and
so many people there were talking
about the good Tanlac wns doing that
I got me a bottle, and from the very
first I began to feel better. My stom
ach stopped bloating in a short time,
my head quit aching and my consti
pation and nervousness disappeared. I
have not been sick since I finished
my third bottle of Tanlac a year ago.
My appetite and digestion are still per
fect. I sleep good and am feeling fine.
Tanlac made a new man of me and
anyone wishing to do so may call me
over the phone, Wasatch 2619 or Wa
satch 2101 J and I will take pleasure
in verifying this statement. Every
body ought to know about Tanlac it
