SHANTUNG IS AS
VITAL TO CHINA
AS IAS ALSACE
TO FRANCE, SAYS
CHINESE VISITOR

Expert to the Chinese Peace
Delegation at Paris, Here on
Visit With Bisbee Friends
GIVES JAPAN WEAPON
TO MENACE THE U. S.
Says Shantung Contains the
Metals Japan Needs for a
. War With This Nation, Also
Strangle Hold Upon Pekin
Declaring that the possession of the
province of Shantung by the Japan
ese is as vital a question to the re
public of China as the possession of
! Alsace-Lorraine by the Germans
again would be to France, Dr. V. K
Ting, technical expert for the Chinese
delegation at the peace conference
at Versailles, who Is visiting friendb
in Bisbee, gave a complete resume
of the Chino-Japanese controversy to
- the Daily Review yesterday in an in
terview. . Dr. -Ting took no excptlon to the
course pursued by President Wilson,
. aaylnr that h. Jylteverf tba .the. pres
sure brought to bear by England
and Japan was sufficient to nullify
any attempts of the president to ef
fect a' different settlement
Vast Economic, Military Value
"The Importance of the presenta
tion of Shantung to Japan," said Dr.
Ting, "lies in the commercial pos
sibilities of the privince and the
country near it, while this same com
mercial worth has also a military
value of much importance to the
Chinese government.
"The province of Shantung in
cludes the port of Tsingtau and rail
road facilities to Pekin, tapping the
only line between Pekin and the vast
Iron and coal deposits along the
Yangste-KIang river. The Japanese
nave already agreed to return the
country surrounding the port, but
this offer means absolutely nothing,
as they hold, and intend to hold, the
port itself and the railroad running
from it. The - country ther have
promised to return is valueless wun
out these facilities, while the posses
sion of them by Japan forms a con
tinual menace against the peace and
safety of China. Let me show you.
Japs Already Menace Pekin.
"The Japanese already hold, by
military occupation, a large part of
Manchuria, to the north, and through
this they already menace Pekin.
With the railroad in Shantung and a
convenient, port, they also menace
the capital from the south, the two
spheres of influence forming a .pin
cers with Pekin in the Jaws. ' The
gravity of the situation is not less
ened by Ihej declaration of Japan that
these parts of China are merely be

DEATH LIST GROWS; DEMOLITION
OF ENTIRE SECTION OF TEXAS
f CITY LEAVES APPALLING SCENE
CORPUS CHRISTI, Sept. 18. Rapid
growth, of the death list resulting from
the hurricane and tidal wave that
swept Corpus Christ! and nearby
points caused the belief among the re
lief workers and local officials tonight
that the total dead would approximate
500 persons.
Much of the shore line of Corpus
Christ! and Nueces bays has not been
explored by searchers, while only a
small proportion of the wreckage in
this city has been moved. This and
the continued absence of many per
sons unheard from since the storm,
was responsible for the rising esti
mate of fatalities.
A thorough survey of the demolish
ed section of the city today by the
Associated Press correspondent show
ed block after block of the beach resi
dential section without a vestige of
the former beautiful homes that lined
Corpus Christ! bay.

CHICAGO, Sept. 18. Ex
plosions in a downtown con
duit today threw manhole
covers high in the air, en
dangering pedestrians, and
was followed by crippling of
street car and lighting ser
vice. Columns of smoke
rose from the manholes and
it required the services of
200 electricians to repair
the damage to high power
cables, the insulation of
which had been ignited.
Printing presses were tem

TREATY UP
SENATE TODAY
Text of Treaty Making Book
As Big as New York Phone
Directory, Must Be Read in
Course of Endless Dispute
- WASHINGTON, Sept. 18. Repub
lican leaders made reply today for
the first voting test next week on
the German peace treaty and Its
league of nations covenant.
Word was sent to Senator John
son of California , author . of an
amendment to equalize the voting
power of Great Britain and the
United States in the league of na
tions and first up for consideration
to return here at once so that de
bate on the amendment might pro
ceed Monday, with. the hope of sign
ing or rejecting It by the end of
the week.
Until this message to the Cali
fornia senator was sent by Senator
Borah of Idaho, after a conference
late In the day with Chairman Lodge
of the foreign relations committee,
the report had persisted around the
capitol that Senator Johnson might
be absent several weeks. Senator
Lodge declared there would be no
vote on amendments this week, and
opponents of the league were pre
pared to resist attempts to force
one by Senator Hitchcock of Ne
braska, leader of the administra
tion's fight for ratification.
The treaty will be called np for
consideration tomorrow, after a two
days' interruption, for continuous
consideration, Actual 'reading of
the pact, which was Btopped short
Tuesday after article three of the
league covenant had been reached,
Is considerably more of a Job than
might be Imagined. The printed
text makes a book almost as big
as a New York city telephone di
rectory. Every line of it must. be
read, with endless debate on some
sections, running, perhaps, into
weeks. ,
In the downtown district utter de
molition of some of the city's most
important industrial and public
plants marked an area extending lor
six blocks along the water front and
more than a block in width, while be
yond that block extending back to
ward the bluff section, every commer
cial establishment was damaged over
a corresponding area two blocks wide.
The tremendous property damage is
becoming daily more apparent. Promi
nent business men and other trained
observers predicted tonight, that $20,
000,000 would be a conservative esti
mate of the monetary loss in Corpus
Cbristl alone, on which it is reliably
stated, not more than $350,000 Insur
ance would be paid.
It was declared unofficially tonight
that a number of bodies not included
in available figures bad been burled
today across Corpus Cbristl bay, near
Portland.

The "Characteristic" of the treaty,

Had the world not already been rent

For one thing, continued the ,presl-
dent, the treaty attempted to Inter-

of Europe. He said that in effect it
proposes to "cut out" every influence
of national privilege.
Discussing the labor section of the
treaty, he declared there would be set
up a new standard of labor for the
whole world, under which laborers
would be "regarded as human."

TREATY OFFERED

State; Army to Be Reduced;
Navy, Air Force Surrender
WASHINGTON, Sept 18. A sum
mary of the Bulgarian treaty of
peace, cabled to the state department
by the American mission at Paris,
shows the pact to follow the same
general plan as the Austrian treaty.
"Many clauses are identical with the
Austrian treaty," says the summary,
"except for the substitution of names,
such as the league of nations, labor,
penalties, prisoners of war, aerial
navigations, and graves.
"Regarding the change In the Bui
garian frontiers, the important
changes are to the south, where Bui
garia cedes western Thracri to the
principal allied and associated pow
ers, and agrees to accept whatever
disposition of this territory the pow
ers ultimately decide, but it is stipul
ated in four places to Serbia's ad
vantage.
"The Bulgarians are required to
recognize the independence of the
Serb, Croat and Slovene state, and
provisions are made to change the
nationality of the inhabitants of the
territory formerly Bulgarian ana
transferred to other states Provi
sions are made for protection of the
minorities of race, language, na
tionality and religion. Within three
months the Bulgarians are required
to demobilize the army and substi

garian army is reduced to 20,000
men, exclusively for the mainten
ance of order and frontier control.
The manufacture of war material is
confined to one establishment, the
other establishments to be closed or
converted.
All warships, submarines, , or air
forces must be surrendered. Bul
garia is required ' to pay as ( repara

francs in gold within thirty-seven
years. Provisions are made for the
creation of an inter-allied commis

sums remitted for reparation coming
through this commission to the re

will be hundreds of signers bv nieht. if nrwt

The recall petition follows th Wal form a a i-it-ocfKi'UnJ

is Dasea and wnich the voters that sign claim can be substan

qualified voters to put Supervisors Adams and Roberts in
the political graveyard. The charges, are in three main sub
divisions, under the head of the Incompetency clause, and
pertain to the alien and peon labor law, the Bisbee-Douglas
road and the Benson and St. David bridges.
Conjecture was rife yesterday in the Bisbee-Lowell
camp of the insurgents who elected Roberts and Adams as
to who their successors would be in the event of. the success
of the recall. -Among those mentioned were Vance John
son, laundvyman of Bisbee, an ex-member of the board of
supervisors. Wm. Coxen, a railroad man of Bowie, employ
ed by the S. P. R. R. Co., T. B. Grace, of Douglas, Wm.
Robinson of Bisbee, well known .lser and said to b,- he

One prominent leader of the recall movement stated1
last night that as far as the question of the highway engineer
was concerned, that while he was and alwnvc
against J. C. Ryan, politically, he and scores of others were
not keen for Supervisors Adams and Roberts' appointee to
the post of highway engineer, when they named Sid Smith,

that while Smith personally was a good fellow, that he was
a new comer to the county and to his knowledge had never
voted and that his assistant, Mr. Stull, had been imported from
Cananea and that there was plenty of local talent available
for that position instead of importing it. Continuing he
said, it is simply a subterfuge of Supervisors Adams and
Roberts to hide their real actions since they have been elect
ed, and to throw us (the party who elected them to office)
a political sop to hide their trails in not carrying out pre
election promises made by them.
The new highway commission will hold a meeting this
afternoon when an official statement of their side in the con
troversy is expected to be issued to the public.

President Wilson, giving eleven
reasons why it could not comply
with his request to postpone the
steel , workers' strike called for
next Monday. ; The letter lso re
cites the history of the movement
to better the conditions of the
workers and expresses faith in
the president's "desire to bring
about a conference" with em
ployers. "We regrtt that for the first
time your call upon organized
labor cannot meet with favorable
response," the letter states. "If
delay were no more than delay,
even at the cost of loss of mem

would urge the same to the full

Immediate strike. But delay
here means the surrender of all

PITTSBURG, Sept. 18. The na

and steel workers late today voted
down a motion to rescind the action
taken at Washington calling a strike
of all workers in iron and steel mills

Some ot the committeemen said

John Fitzpatrick of Chicago, chair

It is said the national committed

Jap Occupation Menaces U. 8.
"The second phase of the problem,
and one which affects the United
States in a particular manner, Is the
fact that the possession of Shantung
gives Japan control of the coal de
posits of the province and the iron
deposits of the Yangtse-Kiang valley,
which have been partly developed
and which' are of great extent. Japan
has very little iron, and her Import
ance as a nation depends upon her
ability to import either crude ore or
steel. . Her reliance upon this ability
to import is so great that when the
United States, during the war, pro
hibited the exportation of steel, the
Japanese found themselves at a1
standstill.
"Through the possession of Shan-,
tung, however, this difficulty will be
removed. Japan will have at her dis
Dosal all the Iron ore and coal she
needs. She has already entered ex
tentively into the development of the
deposits along the Yangtse-Kiang
valley, and, with the railroad in her
hands, her soldiers holding strategic?
positions, and all her energy directed
to the definate possession of the
country forever, she can well afford
to hold to these things while deceiv
ing the world with a promise to re
turn a tract of land which is value
less.
Japan Will Become Arrogant. ,
' "The objection has been Taised that
Germany held the same land without
any attempt on tho part of the Chin
ese government to dispossess her.
The answer is simple. Germany held
thi finrt and province under an
atrreement bv which the land was
given her in reparation for the mur
der of several missionaries. She de
veloped the country very little, and,
in late years, did practically nothing
with regard to increasing her hold
upon It or stretching her sphere ot
influence so as to Include other ter
ritory. Again, she . was a foreign
nation, with interest and enemies in
EuroDe. and Shantung meant little
tn her. Janan. on the contrary, is
close at hand. China is a large field
for her activities. She needs the
coal and iron that China has. Her
imports of these necessities are con
stantly increasing in volume, and
when she has firmly fastened her
self to Shantung, the United States
will quickly perceive a change in her
attitude towards this country, for
with coal and iron she is independ
ent, and with independence will come
arrogance. This has been the 6tory
in the past, and this will be the story
in the future."

thorough examination and went un

do her any good at all. Every time
she ate anything she would suffer
something awful with gas and
cramping spelling afterwards.
"Sometimes she would be so nau

in Portland
That's the' history of service from Goodrich
De Luxe Truck Tires on .the large fleet of the
Jones Lumber Company, of Portland.
But aside from this very liberal mileage re
turn De Luxe Tires are. rendering a distinctly
noticeable and more valuable service to the me
chanism of the truck. !
Mr. Jones says: ;:';
"We like the De Luxe Tire for the extra
cusnion it affords on the rear where the bulk
'of the load is carried. We also find that this
'extra layer of rubber minimizes the wear and
tear on the gears, bearings and worm."
Thus in De Luxe Tires you get not only the
economy of greater mileage, but added truck

MR. WILSON IN SHIRT SLEEVES
BL T. shrewedly remarks that when "Mr. Wilson drops into
slang he reminds us of a nice girl trying to swear," and he
adds that "shirt sleeves and a silk hat make a queer com-
bination." They not only make a queer combination but one
which arouses even in the plainsman's simple breast an acute pain.
Col. Roosevelt could employ the devices which Mr. , Wilson rather
laboriously is using in his western speeches, but they carried be
cause they were his own. He could bust a broncho and therefore
he could wear chaps. Mr. Wilson in chaps oratorical chaps well,
we think the conjunction is not happy.
But does this matter? We think it does. "Manners maketh
man," was the old proverb, and manners, in this - proverb, meant
what we mean by morals. We do not think Mr. Wilson's disposition
to call names and to make accusations against the opposition as
pro-German or bolshevist reflects a favorable light upon his very
lofty claims. Both are the cheapest slanders without any respectable
support. It is patently insincere to bracket the United States and
Germany as willfully outside the league. Germany has asked to be
in the league. Mr. Wilson and his international colleagues at Paris
have refused her entrance. There is no resemblance between such
a situation and that which America would occupy even if the treaty
should fail of our ratification. The intent obviously is merely to
borrow opprobium from War feeling against Germany in order to
discredit Mr. Wilson's opponents. The charge of bolshevisni would
be ridiculous in a matter less important.
Also we do not think sincerity is a characteristic of Mr. Wil
son's declaration that the treaty must be accepted in toto or re
jected. This is the language of a stubborn, or let us adopt one of
Mr. Wilson's favorite words and say "wilful," partisanship. It is
not true. The treaty need not be swallowed whole or rejected
whole. Other treaties have been amended. Reservations have been
made before. It seems it is oily when Mr. Wilson creates that we
must humbly receive or blasphemously refuse.
As a matter of fact, the principal reservations proposed do not
affect 90 per cent of the treaty. They do not alter any of the terms
impo6cd upon the defeated natibns. They leave intact all those
safeguards and reparations demanded by England and France. They
leave the whole general plan for the league of nations untouched
except that they make clear and unmistakable to the governments
with which we are about to undertake ' a difficult experiment, that
certain interests and securities deemed' by us essential to our wel
fare are not to be held, by implication or unforeseen interpretation,
surrendered or infringed, any more than Britain's essential para
mountcy on the seas is affected. They allow for a full and fair at
tempt to erect the new mechanism of international relation with
our sincere participation but at the same time with a clear under
standing that if the forces' of imperial ambition and natural egoism
which have brought about so many evils in Europe, and which we
see operating today, are found at work beyond our effective regula
tion or control, then we shall be free to retire.
Mr. Wilson places certain reliance upon the work of his and
his associates' hands. He makes prophecies and promises which
no statesman willing to consider human fallibility would make. We
are unable to adopt this certitude upon Mr. Wilson's invitation, and
we wish only to provide as well as we may against future misunder
standings. The reservations, in our opinion, are chiefly important
and of vital importance in making clear to ourselves as well as
to the world that America enters the league with her eyes open.
ANOTHER BLOW DELIVERED TO JUSTICE
IN the reprehensible action of the angry mob at Pueblo which
lynched two Mexicans, who were being 'held in connection with
the murder of a patrolman, we see not only a flagrant violation
of justice, but an action which can only intensify the strained
relations between the United States and Mexico. '
Mob rule ii addition to being incompatible to law and order,
and an unconscionable violation of the laws which grant all persons
a fair trial, is at all times, at the most, inaccurate in retaliation,
chiefly because of the blinded passion leading those who would take
the law in their hands. As a result, oft times, the lives of innocent
persons merely held on suspicion in connection with crimes are
sacrificed and the guilty go unpunished.
That adequate punishment will be meted out to members of 11k
mob responsible for the lynching is promised in a statement
given out by the governor of Colorado, and justly sp, as jt leaves a
blot on the name of the fair state of Colorado and the city of Pueblo,
which only a rigorous hunting down and bringing to justice of the
ring leaders of the mob can rectify.
In addition, from an international standpoint, it will be exceed
. ingly difficult for the Mexican government to understand why such
threatening representations are made to her because of the depreda
tions committed against Americans in baadit-infested districts of
Mexico, when Mexico's nationals are lynched in the orderly state of
Colorado, and by a body of citizens at that not bandits. Such in
cidents can only make more marked the misunderstanding between
the two countries. Globe Record.
FROM BAD TO WORSE-.
IT would appear, even to those least inclined to stand 'with the
alarmists and the Calamity Janes, that there is grave danger that
the very evident intention of the radical elements in the
miaers' unions to try to nationalize the coal mines may make a
bad situation in the coal industry worse. Low production of the
present is blamed to car shortage and labor difficulties. And dur

CALIFORNIA MAN BUYS $30,000
HERD CATTLE NEAR PHOENIX
PHOENIX, Sept. 18. One of the
largest cattle transactions in the
valley in some time was announced
by C. W. Bowers, president of the
Merritt Bowers company of Tulare,
Cal., who stated that he had pur
chased the entire shorthorn herd
of the Bartlett-Heard Land and Cat
He company, numbering 146 head.
The Merritt-Bowers company is
one of the largest livestock con
cerns on the coast and have pre
viously purchased large consign
ments of Arizona cattle. Practical
ly all of the stock bought yester
day has been sold in California
with the exception of a carload of
two-year-old heifers, which will be
sent direct to Riverside for exhibi
tion, from there o Los Angeles and
later to San Francisco.
"In shipping the two-year-olds to
the coast for exhibition," stated Mr.
Merritt, "we are not going to try to
conceal the fact they are from Ari-!
zona. We are proud of it and are
going to be sure that wherever
they go on exhibition, everyone will
know where they were raised. We
always have thought this the finest j
place In the country in the world
for that matter, and thi3 herd will
certainly prove our contention."
The consideration for the cattle
was in the neighborhood of $30,000,

Campaign of awakening to the prob
lems of the after-the-war. service. It
is hoped that there may be great ex
pansion in all the general missions
of ; the .Church. But the greatest
emphasis is to be laid on the home
field. Church leaders believe that
the greatest effectiveness is obtained
generally when specific problems -which
are at hand have 'been' solved.
And so from one end of the country
to the other there is to be a rebuild
ing on ; more comprehensive plan of
church activity than ever. One re
sult will be that the Seamen's
Church Institute scheme. will be ex
tended to all the important ports of
the country. Doubtless Captain
Huntington's idea will wave i-its
counterpart in 'some "of the new in
stitutes. The School Record. '
To the seaman, who might other-.
"wise never gain the'knowledge neces
sary to pass his examination for a
navigator's license, the school eomes
as a welcome aid. Under .the navi--gation
laws a man must have two
years' sea "experience before h can
take his examination, but many men
have been at sea for years and even
then failed to pass. At the school,
however, the necessary training Is
given and a few weeks dded to the
two years' sea experience is all that
is necessary in most cases for the
applicant to qualify for his,.-license.

BY REVIEW
STOCKS AND BONDS
NEW YORK, Sept 18. The crisis
in the steel labor situation was again
the overshadowing influence In to
day's nervous stock market, other con
siderations and developments, includ
ing several of favorable import,' re
ceiving scant attention.
In financial circles it was still be
lieved that the views of the conser
vative element among the labor lead
ers would preyail, but advices from
Pittsburg and other industrial centers
seemed to offer little encouragement.
Trading was lighter and more cir
cumscribed than at any recent period,
but the trend during the greater part
of the session was downward, leaders
for the most part recording lowest
prices of the week.
United States Steel was under con
stant pressure, losing about 1 points
at its lowest and recovering more than
at the close. Associated issues and
allied equipments followed the same
course, though fluctuating within a
broader radius.
The money market tightened, open
ing at 4 per cent for call loans and
closing at 6 per cent, hut conditions in
foreign exchange was more favorable.
Liberty 394 's and 4$i's were active
and strong, but domestic Issues and In
tern'ationals developed moderate irreg
ularity. Total sales, par value, were
$18,500,000. Old United States bonds
were unchanged oil call.
THE GRAIN MARKETS
CHICAGO, Sept 18. Indications
that farmers wera adopting the pro
ject of holding back grain and live
stock to obtain higher prices gave an
advantage to bulls In corn despite con
tinued thhreatening labor develop
ments. Corn closed strong, 2c to
4c net higher, with September $1.47
and December $1.24 to $1.25. Oats
finished lc to 2c up. In provisions
the outcome ranged from 80c decline
to a rise of 47c.
Although at first uncertainty dom
inated corn and there was much spec
ulative selling based on prospects of
industrial disturbances, it was not
long before buyers W6re in a majority.
Dificulty in covering short sales
tended to lift the market after the
first rise and there was a general dis
position to attribute this chiefly to an
altered attitude of producers. Besides
scarcity of rural offerings, a strength
ening of foreign exchange counted
j somewhat against ihe bears, as did
revival of export business in rye and
barley. Rainy weather also was a
bullish factor.
Oats ascended with corn.
Provisions were., weak. Packers
sold lard and foreign demand was
low.

"Your telegram guanateeing Bis-

for relieving our monds of this detail,
let me advise you that so far you are
the first Arizona city" to agree to

expect the others will be in by tomor
row night, but Bisbee is first.
"If there is anything that we can
do to assist in raising your $100, don't
hesitate to call on us. We expect to
have a crowd of boosters through
Bisbee pulling for the race about the
end of the month, and I trust that I
shall have the pleasure of making
your acquaintance at that time."

White Sox Player
Former Bisbeean
Anent the coming world's series it
will be of interest to Cochise county
fans to .know that "Chick" Candill,
first baseman for the White Sox. is
a former resident of Bisbee, having
worked , here and at Cananea for
more than a year. Johnny Twomey,
who delivered this bit of information,
refused to conjecture at the time

Sentence Former
Police Chief Today
Juan Robaes, former chief of police
at Cananea, who is declared to have
also acted as chief organizer for the
I. W. W. across the Mexican line, was
arrested yesterday on a charge of dis
turbing the peace and found guilty by
Judge Hogan. Sentence will be pro
nounced this morning.
According to the police, Robles went
to the home of his divorced wife, from
whom he has been separated for two
years, and attempted to pull her child
from her arms, following numerous
threats that he would kidnap the Infant.
Running to form and with charges
such as wife beating, attempted child
stealing, the intimidation of defense
less women and the like placed
against their names on the police blot
ter, the number of I. W. W.'s to see
the inside of a jail lately was in
creased to four yesterday when Domi
nic Cotero, confessed Wobbly, and
possessor of a notorious notebooK, was
arrested on charge of having abus
ed Carlota Bent, a tenant of his. Ac
cording to Xiie police, Cotero entered
her residence and cursed and threat
ened the woman without provocation.
The arrest was made by J. A. Kemp
ton, chief of police.
The other I. W. W.'s to have faced
a judge are John Harvey, Charles
H. Bentley, accused of vagrancy, a
charge which seemed to be substan

to pay dues to William D. Haywood,

INFORMATION TO THE MEXICAN COLONY
OF THE CITY OF BISBEE, ARIZ.:
THE PATRIOTIC COMMITTEE of Bisbee wishes to inform
the public, that in respect to certain rumors that have been
circulated among the Mexican laborers that The Phelps Dodge
Corporation, Copper Queen Branch, and other merchants of
this city have contributed with a big amount of cash money
for our Patriotic celebration, and we wish to say, that it is not
true. At the same time we will say that the only donation re
ceived for this celebration, was from Mr. W. M. Appal, fore
man of the Copper Queen warehouse, which consisted of 35
cases of soda water, and 200 lbs. of ice.
The same party also promised the Committee, to pay the
police officers, to keep order at the place of celebration, for
which we thank him very kindly. ; ; j
In case that Mr. Appal would bring us any amount of
money now that our celebration is over, we will not accept a
cent, under any circumstances.
It is our duty to publish that the Committee' was short
$36.00 in expenses which we, the undersigned will pay of our
' own money. , i
