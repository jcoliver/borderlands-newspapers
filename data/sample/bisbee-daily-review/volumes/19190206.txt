STORY OF FOE'S
FAILURE TOLD
BY ARMY STAFF
Figures Give Inside Reasons for German Defeat After
Supreme Effort to Crush Allies in One
Final, Huge Onslaught
(By Review Leased Wire)
WASHINGTON', Feb. 5. The
story of Germany's supreme ef io: i
for military victory in the spring
of 191S. of American intervention
on the western front and of the
ultimate crushing defeat of the
enemy and the apparent annihila
tion of nearly one-half of his fight
ing force was graphically told in
figures made public today by the
war department. They dealt with
the 'Title strength' 'of the allies
and the German ' forces on the
western front in monthly periods
from April 1 to November 1, and
were prepared, by the- intelligence
division of the general staff of the
American army in France.
By rifle strength was meant the
"number of men standing in the
trench ready to go over with the
bayonet- When Germany struck
its' great blow last spring, it had a
million and a half men so classi
fied against an allied total of "a
million and a quarter. By June 1
the Germans reached their peak
with 1.639,000 rifles, but despite
the terrific pressure they were ex
erting against the allied lines.
American aid was overcoming the
handicap and made possible the
counter blow delivered in Jaly.
Allied Strength in
July 1,496,000
The allied strength on June 1
was 1.496.000. Shortly afterwards
the allies reached a total of 1,547,
000 composed of 778.000 French,
515,000 British and 254.000 Amer
icans. America's contribution had
risen from 65,000 in ApriL On
July 1 Germany's power had be
: gun to wane and for the first rime
it was definitely inferior in rifle
strength with 1.412,000. compared
to 1.556.000 for the allies.
DISCHARGES FROM
HAW ARE BEGUN
iBv Rvtew leased Wirr-)
WASHINGTON. Feb. 6. Read Ad
miral Victor Blue, chief of the
reau of navigation, wrote Chairman
Padgett of the house naval commit-1
tee today, that the navy department
had directed to 'date the release of 40
per cent of the reserves, 40 per cent
of the men who enlisted for the war
only and 20 per cent of the men who
since the beginning of the war had
enlisted for the regular four year per
iod. Commanding officers of ships and
stations hare been directed. Admiral
Blue said, to give preference in mak
ing releases to men with dependent
families and men desiring to complete
their education. He exnlained that if
the number of applicants exceeded
that number of men the nary could
spare, discharges would be decided by
lot.
The admiral wrote that the bureau
was very desirous of completing the
demobilization of the navy personnel
ss quickly as possible . but that it
soon would have to place in commis
sion some 38 to 40 large vessels to be
used as transports in bringing home
troops from France and that in addi
tion a number of cargo ships had to be
manned. Activities of the navy could
not be interfered with, he 6aid, and
provision must also be made for ac
tivities la prospect.
Admiral Blue estimated that by Feb
ruary 20 half of the remaining person
nel on rtore would have been dis
charged. New enlistments in the navy now
are at the rate of about 1600 a week,
the admiral said, but he added that
the full effect of new enlistments on
demobilization plans would not be felt
for several months, as the new men
would have to be trained before they
could be sent to ships.

Up to September 1 the allied
strength continued to gain despite
the desperate counter attack
which was being driven forward
all along the line. In mid-October
the American strength had risen
to an estimated force of 350.000.
On September 1 the allied line
was at its greatest strength with
1.6S2.000 against Germany's 1,3.1!),
000. While the allies had shrunk in
rifles to 1.4S5.0O0 on November 1
Germany's last hope was gone as
she faced that army with only
866.000 bayonets.
Germans on Decline ;
Americans Increase
The sudden decline or the Ger
man forces beginning in June and
again apparent in the swift drop
during October was accounted for
by the fact that she had drawn
' into the lines during the spnag
every available reserve, expecting
to smash her way to victory be
fore -winter came. The reserves
were used up in the German at
tack and the allied assaults which
followed, while the American
force continued to increase. In
a rough wa the American rifle
strength has represented about 20
per cent of the total American
force in France continuously. This.
accounts for the fact that with a
total of more than 2,000,0o0 men
in France on November 11 the
rifle strength in October was esti
mated at around 350,000 men. A
similar situation, was shown in
staff reports as to the total allied
strength, reckoned as "ration
strength, which was continuously
greater than that of the German
army throughout the spring and
summer last year.

" We are now recording another promise. Note it, and
note at the same time that we will redeem this new prom

This is the promise. We will have that drill biting

WASHINGTON. Feb. 5 Considera
tion by the house today of the annual
naval appropriation bill brought forth
more criticism of President Wilson,
some members asserting that he was
endeavoring to force the auihorizaiioa
of a new three year building program
without taking congress into his con
fidence as to events at Paris, which
made ucu legislation necessary at
IhiA time.
Discussion aloes this line followed
receipt by Chairman Padgett of the
naval committee of a cablegram from
the president expressing satisfaction
with the unazimous decision of tnc
Laval committee to recommend the
new construction program.
There was Litle debate on the bill
itself, opposition to the proposed in
crease in naval ships was voiced ci
rectly by only one member. Represen
tative Little of Kansas, republican,
who declared the construction would
add to the country's financial burden
"at a time when we have no enemy in
the world.
Representative Graham of .Illinois,
republican, declaring a desire for a
big navy, said the new program was
"not extraordinarily large for our fu
ture safety," but added that in voting
for the expansion it would be humiliat
ing to hi iii if it appeared that he did
fo "under the whip and spur that is be
ing administered by the president.
AGREEMENT REACHED

At a meeting of the county highway
commission with the board of super

something approaching a complete un
derstanding relative to road work was
reached by the two bodies. J. J. Bow
en of Blabee, Harry A. Clark of Doue
las. members of the highway commis
sion, and J. C. Ryan, engineer for the
proposition, gave no details on their
return, except that Mr. Bo wen said a
supplementary meeting between the
two bodie3 would take place in Bis bee
Monday, when the highway commis
sion holds its regular meeting.
The commission now is advertising
for bids on a bridge over Silver creek,
east of Donglas. and for grading the
approaches to the structure. Within
the next ten days bids will be adver

Proposed Sale of Arizona Land
To Utah Assailed; Review Upheld
Disbee. Ariz . Feb. 3. 1919.
The Uisbee Daily Review.
Ever since the move was started bv
the state of Utah to acquire a piece
of Arizona I have been looking for
some Arizona paper or public-spirited
citizen to start-a protest against that
propesKjen.
, Your editorial in tlii-s morning's
paper is the first thing I have seen
and it is commendable and should fce
backed up by every Arizonan.
There are a good many reasons
why the people of Arizona should not
part with that portion cf Arizona
north of the Grand canyon.
The Grand canyon is within the
boundaries f Arizona entire and gives
Arizona distinction over any other
state on that account. It is a wonder
ful asset to Arizona at present and is
going to be more so in the near fu
ture. The great complaint seems to be
that the country north of the canyon
is not properly administered by Ari
zona and that if Utah had it she
could give the citizens of the strip
better protection from outlaws, tramp
sheep and cattlemen and such. To
remedy this let the Etate of Arizona
create a new county up there, calling
it Grand Canyon county and that
solves the whole matter. The country
is rich and large enough to support
a county government and while popu
lation is rather scarce there are
plenty of people to run and support a
strong county
Besides, that would be an impetus ;
to business and settlement and soon
there would be good towns scattered .
over the county.
This section of Arizona is a high
plateau country, averaging 6000 . feet
alMtuie, and is broken by deep can-
vnns whiiA mnp-h i ' ( cror! n V c- rni-n.r
J ZD T f ' -" -J v
many other portions. j
The formation for the most part is i
sandstone and limestone and much of I
the country is covered with the !
species of timber known as stag bark '
juniper, or what is generally known!
in these parts as cedar. j
The country is a '.grazing country, I
given over mostly to cattle and sheep, j
There is some good farming land, j
however, and in the future much more'
will be done in that respect. Two!
national forests lie within the bound
aries of the strip and much good tim
ber grows which will some dav be a
' source of revenue for th? country.
Oil has been prospected for, but
none found. Very little mineral has
been fo-ind.
Should it he fr. :.:id impracticable to
lorra a new county out of the strip
another way by vthku the problem
could be solved would be the con
structing cf a bridge across the Colo
rado rier, makin? the country ac
cessible to Kingman, the county seat
Again, 1 am opposed to giving over
any part of Arizona to Utah for the
reason that it will mean the propaga
tion of Mormonism. Utah once tried
to force the dismemberment of 'Ari
zona, but she failed ia this and now
she Wisnts to tujole and wheedie us
into seilins or trading it off.
Utah offers us in exchange for the
strip what is known as San Juan
county, Utah. V"e do not want Sau
Juan ccuntr. Utah. That county is
6u per cent Indian reservation and it
appears to me that Arizona has moc
Indian reservation territory now jhan
what she is entitled to . Arizona now
already has more Indian reservation
in area and square miles than all the
rest of the United States put together.
We want a country that we can de
velop; one on which we can prospect,
run stock, take up homesteads and
make settlement and increase our
population.
I am glad you entered a protest.
Mr. Editor, against the El Paso Her
ald's suggestion. Well could it come
from Eisbee, Cochise county.
Dear old Cochise, which has always
been in lead when the welfare of Ari
zona is concerned, I hope you lead
out in a protest against this move to
filch a part of Arizona. - W
Yours for Arizona in particular and
the good of the whole people con
cerned in the matter.

LEWIS DEFEATS WYLIE
WAR MSOMHff
DETAILS GIVEf
Oi" particular interest to every man
who has been in the army. nay or.
war work where he was entitled to
government insurance, is an announce-'
men; made from Washington by Col.
Henry l .Lir.dsiey of the war risk in-;
surance bureau. Rates soon are to:
be made public. Attention was tailed j
to the article by Thomas Blair of this i
city, who for several months woikedi
vvii.i me government m writing war
risk insurance.
"i have been asked by practically
every man returning to the Warron:
district whether th- insurance would j
cany on or not. This article is thej
first announcement I have seen which ;
answered the question," said Mr. !
Blair. 1
The article- says in part: I
There will be six different kinds of j
insurance ordinary, life, 20-paymeut '
life, 3i-payment life. i'O-year endow-J
meat, 30-year endowment and endow-i
ment payable at the age of 62. All!
policies wiii contain clauses providing
that ia case of permanent total dis
ability of the insured man the govern
ment will make monthly payments to
him aud premium payments will cease.
None Need Be Destitute.
This amounts virtually to old ase
pensioning and disability insurance
and insures that no man who has
served in the army or san need ever
be destitute if he carries the govern
ment insurance.
All policyholders will participate in
dividends and earniugs of over 3"
per cent from the insurance fund will
go into dividends. Since the reserves
will be invested in government securi
ties, most of which will pay ia the
neighborhood of 4li per cent, it is
certain that there will ce large divi
dends to he returned periodically to
policyholiers.
Collections of premiums will be
made through postmasters in each
community.
Colonel Lindslev sr.-irjul tnAtx- iioi
" -""i i
the rates would be so low that offi-j
cials of private insurance companies
which assisted ia drafting the rate!
scneoule had admirted that they
could not compete with them.
Not More Than $10,000.
Any man now in military or naval
service holding government term life
insurance can obtain the new forms
tut the amount will be limited to his
present holdings, which, in no case,
are more than $10,000. - The govern
ment urges ail men to continue to
carry their present policies but to
convert these as soon as they are
financially able within the next five
years.
The government itself and not pri
vate companies will carry these con
vened policies, it was emphasised to
day in denial of reports that the insurance-business
bul-c up or, the lives
of lighting iusn during the war would
now be turned over by the govern
ment to private concerts.
The "war risk bureau todav reported

When Swift & Company paid, sdy, 13
dollars per hundredweight for live beef cat
tle last year, their profit was only, 13 cents I
In other words, if we had paid $13.13, we
would have made no profit , .
Or, if we had received a quarter of a cent
per pound less for dressed beef we would
have made no profit.
It is doubtful whether any other business is run on
so close a margin of profit.
This is bringing the producer and the consumer
pretty, close together which should be the object of any
industry turning raw material into a useful form.
This remarkable showing is due to enormous volume,
perfected facilities (packing plants strategically located,
branch houses, refrigerator cars, etc.), and an army of
men and women chosen and trained to do their special
work.
This, and many other points of interest, are found in
the Swift & Company Year Book for 1919, just published
which is brought out for the public ks well as for the
25,000 Swift & Company shareholders.
The Year Book also represents the packer's side of
the Federal Trade Commission investigation, upon which
Congress is asked to base action against the industry.
Many who. have never heard the packer's side are
sending for the Year Book.

Greed in Utah's Offer
Comparison of the district in Utah and the district in Arizona, whic.1
Utah would trade through committees meeting in Phoenix this week,
show that little is to be gained by this state and much by our neigh
bor if the deal is consumated. San Juan county, which Utah would cede
to Arizona, is poor and unproductive territory. "The Strip" along the
northern border of Arizona, which Utah is asking, is rich although un
developed. Utah's greatest gain in securing control of the strip would be por
tions of two 'national forests in the state of Arizona. Both of these
reserves are rich In timber, especially in cedars, and offer fertile, green,
abundant grazing lands.
Utah's loss In ceding San Juan county would be chiefly Indian
reservation and barren lands, which offer little in timber and much less
in grazing fields and ranges for cattle.
The forest reserves of the northern part of the state are one of Ari
zona's greatest assets. The largest standing pine and spruce forests of
the United States are located along the Grand Canyon of the Colorado.
Throughout the district which Utah would secure are beautiful standings
of pine, spruce, juniper and cedar. This timber will some day be a great
asset to the state.
Utah want3 some of Arizona's timber lands; Utah wants an oppor
tunity to claim one side and an interest in the Grand Canyon of the Colo
rado; Utah is seeking to unload a part of its Indian reservatoins on Ari
zona in exchange for rich forest reservations,
Utah's need for Arizona's grazing lands is reflected in a protest from
residents of the strip." in which the governor of Arizona is requested to
take steps to keep Utah cattle and sheep off Arizona ranges.
Utah's selfishness in the proposed trade is mirrored in Utah's active
and aggressive methods in seeking to "put over" a pet plan through the
"rush act" now being played by a committee from the northern neigh
bor. Arizona's residents along the strip have already objected strenuously
to Utah's proposaL Isolated as they are, handicapped in communicating
with their county seats, they are satisfied to remain under Arizona
government.
Their protests alone should end Utah's prospects of consummation of
this deaL But the evident-greed cf the Utah proposal added to the de
sires of the residents along the strip, should at once put the stamp of dis
approval on the scheme. Arizona's committee should listen to Utah's
delegates respectfully and then send them home to think up another
land-grabbing game. '

Paving Bisbee Streets
-
At least seven weeks must elapse before the citizens of Bisbee
can Tote whether or not they will pave the main streets. During this
period the city attorney will prepare ordinances calling for an election,
publish the ordinances, and in other manners make ready for the polling.
The city engineer meantime will complete his surveys and estimates,
and preiare for the letting of bids.
After the election has been held, if the city rotes bonds for the
paving, many days and perhaps weeks must elapse before bids can be let
to contractors, and before contractors can begin actual construction.
Three months, and perhaps more will elapse before actual work will
be started, providing, of course, the taxpayers authorize the work.
This seems a long time to wait, especially when demand for jobs
is fast becoming greater than demand for men. But at the end of that
time Bisbee, always foremost in meeting emergencies, will have out
stripped every other city in the state in supplying employment through
public construction for tiding over a period of depression.
More Freak Legislation
Of course every Arizonan is interested in publicity for the state and
in supplying Arizona with proper means of securing favorable publicity.
But we do not think that the citizens of the state are more interested
in notoriety than important legislation.
For this reason, few Arizonans "give a whoop" if the legislature
ceases discussion of minor measures and confines itself to business.
The house has been working on a measure to adopt an official song
for the state. Does Arizona need an official song? '
In a Kansas training camp over a year ago a few Arizonans sat
in one of the Y. M. C. A. huts listening to a vocalist from Kansas City
who had been sent to entertain the "boys." She sang "I'm from Ari
zona." Every soldier from Arizona sat up proudly when she started the
selection, and at the close Arizonans led in the applause. The song
was of the state from which the soldiers were proud to come. They
would have yelled and cheered as vociforously for any other song
which smacked of the state last admitted to the union.
Any song of the state, under the circumstances, would have been an
official song. And under similar circmustances any song of Arizona will
be official if the setting is proper.
One state, recently becoming prohibition territory, has before its
legislature a measure to regulate the price of "bootleg" whisky.
Bootleg and song can be companions only under certain conditions;
and this is not the condition of which you are thinking.
But the legislature ha3 more important matters to consider.
Timely Exposure
. - s
Exposure by Governor Campbell of the manner in which state funds
have been squandered by the commission 'of state institutions, comes at
a tinu-Iy moment. A bill is now before the legislature having as its
purpose the abolishment of the state commission and the reinstatement
of the old board of control.
Whether Governor Campbell introduced his evidence before the house
as a political move or not. he acquainted the citizens of Arizona with a
deplorable condition at a moment when the state i3 considering how its
various institutions may best be handled in the future.
The evidence which he handed the legislature in his message is
damning. A large deficit today and demands for an emergency appropri
ation of almost a half-million dollars, to nfeet the expenses of state
institutions .for th r.ext four or five months, are sufficient argument in
themselves azainst the present method.
The report is one dark blot on the record of the commission. Every
item in the governor's message, save one, is a blow at the commission
theory as it has been constituted in the past.
The one bright spot deserves mention; the University of Arizona is
the only institution which bids fair to live within its original appropria
tions. .
But the fact that administration of the state institutions has cost
Arizona a half-million dollars more ..than appropriated for this purpose
looms as one great charge which in the end will result in the abolition
of the commission. The state cannot tolerate, the taxpayers cannot
sustain commisbions which throw the people's money to the winds.
Arguments of efficiency, or greater accomplishment in lesser time, of
more central control, dwindle to nothing when the financial repbrt of
the commission is read.
tax fund to be administered under
the supervision, of the state highwav
engineer, while the other half of the '
total levy would be placed at the dis- j
posal of the county supervisors. ' The
bill declares the matter an emergency
and would exempt it from the refer
endum provision of the state consti
tution.

Frank Luke, jr., who fell fighting the
Germans as a member of the United
States aviation force, was proposed
by Waters in a new bill introduced
today.
An amendment to the civil code was
introduced by Phillips, who proposed
regulations to govern community prop
erty in the event of the death of a
husband or wife. The measure would
provide that in the event of "the tieaia
of one, half thr community Drooertv
would go to the other, the balance be

deceased, or, if there was no will to
be apportioned among the next of kin.
If there be no will and no next of kin,
the whole property would revert to
the surviving husband or wife.
Other bills introduced in the house
were:
Bill 77 by Delbridge, providing that
a judge shall give the court clerk from
10 to 20 days' notice to draw a grand
or trial jury; that the grand jury

NEW BILL AIMS TO
CIB LOAN SHARKS
OSv Review Lt-a.scd YViif)
PHOENIX, Ariz.. Feb. 5. Three in-
teresting bills were introduced in the
state senate today, one providing for
a board of arbitration between em
ployers and employes, another plan
ning to curtail the activities of what
are designated as "loan sharks' 'and a
third by Buehman to raise the legis
lators remuneration from the present
$7 a day with milea:, the salary be
ing limited to 60 days, to $1000 for a
two-year term with 20 cents mileage
one way. ;
Claridge introduced the arbitration
measure. It would provide a board oi
three members appointed by the gov
ernor, subject to confirmation by the
senate, one to be an employer, one to
be an employe and a third to he a
member of some labor organization.
They would hold office till January,
1921. and after that date members
would be appointed for one, two and
three terms.
The measure aimed at usury was
fathered by Hughes. It defines a Kiua'l
loan as one uiuier $300 and sets that
figure as the limit of principal indebt
edness of any one person to a money
lender, with interest at the ptneral
legal or contract interest rate of the
state. Proof that usurious interest
had been charged would mean the
forfeituie of the debt by the money
lender. The inU-rcst rate set in the
bill is 3 1-2 per cent per month, while
a provision would permit the lmrrowcr
to pay iiH liif- Tnd'lit'dncss at any

Dr. Edwards Olive Tablets the substi

NEW YORK. Feb. 5. Coppers were
the issues around which today's dull
zr.l irregular securities market
rtvolved. American Smelting making
i gross decline of bU points on an-
nouncement of a reduction in the
quarterly dividend from lVs to 1 per
cent.
This action occasioned some sur -
prise. Kindred stocks were heavy,
evidently in the belief that returns to
shareholders are likely to suffer sim
ilar revision, together with the widely
recognized fact that prevailing con
ditions in the metal industry are uu
certain, at best.
In the main, however, the market
seemed disposed to throw off some of
its recent heaviness ana short cover
ing was again impelled in such lead
ers United States Steel, shippings, to
baccos, distilling, food and utility
Issues, at extreme gains of 1 to 3
points.
Oils anJ motors offered better re
sistance to pressure and rails were
firm. Sales amounted to 375,000
shares.
A firmer tone ruled for time and
call funds, the latter rising to 5 per
cent in the final hour.
New maximums were scored by
French municipal issues, but domestic
bondi including the Liberty group,
eased. Total sales, par value, aggre
gated $14.S50,000. Old United States
coupon and registered 4s gained i
per tent on call.
GRAIN MARKET.
CHICAGO, Feb. 5. Heavy selling
of corn resulted today from shrinkage
of demand from feeders and owing to
enlarged rural offerings. The market j
ciosed unsettled 2S4 to 3T net lower,)
with May $1.13Tg to $1.14 and July
n.lOs to ?1-107. Oats finished 1
to 134 off, and provisions down 22c
to 90.
Sentiment regarding corn became
almost unanimously bearish'and there
were but few traders who showed a
disposition to accumulate holdings
evea at the sharp declines which were
registered.
Sins pointed to a better movement
of the crop than has been the rule of
late and weather conditions for such
a purpose were said to be ideal. On
the otheriand, rallies due to a ship
ping lockout at Buenos Aires and to
gossip that . seaboard exporters were
buying here did not attain much force.
Oats receded with corn. Big stocks
and the slowness of export call ga-e
an advantage to the bears.
Provisions reflected the weakness
of grain. On the breaks, however,
packers and foreigners were said-to
have bought.
COTTON MARKET.
NEW Y ORK, Feb. 5. Cotton closed
at approximately the lowest point of
the day, although the tone was steady,
net unchanged to 55 points lower.

GOVERNOR PROCLAIMS
ROOSEVELT MEMORIAL
Declaring the death of Theodore
Roosevelt to be a world loss, Governor
Thomas E. Campbell has issued a
proclamation setting aside Sun Jay,
February 9, as Roosevelt memorial
day, to be observed generally by the
people ot the state.
The proclamation says in part:
"He was not only a great man. but
a national inspiration, raising the
standard in American political life
and by precept and example changing
the mental attitude of the people and
instilling in them the true obligations
or citizenship. His character, rugged
and energizing made a peculiar appeal
to the west. His loe for this broad
expanse of country with its promise
of future greatness beyond the ken
of human understanding found lasting
expression in that great engineering
achievement, the Roosevelt dam. the
living waters of which have made glad
the heart of the Salt River valley and
caused the desert to blossom lie the
rose.
"It is, therefore, meet and proper
that as a nation and a state.' we
should pause and pay tribute to our
peerless leader who, although depart
ed this life, has lef; a marked impress
upon bis country's life and historv.
The congress of the United States has
set aside Sunday; February the 9th,
as the day when it shall conduct serv
ices in his honor. '
. "Now, therefore, I. Thomas E. Canit-
bell, governor of Arizona, bv virtue
of the authority vested in me by law
do hereby set aside Sunday,.February
the 9th, as Roosevelt Memorial day
and urge the people of the various
communities on that occasion through
the medium of public meetings and
church services to pay honor to the
memory of this Great American."

Labor conditions consequent to
the return ot" American soldiers
from France and the cantonments
and the apparent inability of in
dustries to absorb ail of them,
present a grave danger to the na
tion in the view of V. R. Abhurst.
United States employment agent
here. This statement was made
by Mr. Ashurst in announcing a
meeting of the community labor
board to be held at the Y. M. C. A.
tonight at 7: CO o'clock, at which
time the problem of placing re
turned soldiers in industry and the
economic welfare of the county as
a whole, will be discussed.
"The boys are coming home and
we have no positions at which we
can place them." said Mr. Ash
urst. "If we wish to avert a great
calamity, we must get busy auu
make place3 for that portion
which may come to Bisbee. If we
are goiug to do anything, we must
do it now. Nest summer will be
too late.
"Our meetings therefore assume
more than casual importance to
the country and community. I
wish the representative citizens
would attend in larger numbers
than 'hitherto. I might suggest
also that the pastors of the local
churches attend. Suggestions will
be welcome and mav prove helpful."
I
In compliance with a request from '
the I'nited Stales department of labor
the Bisbee Central Labor union adopt
ed a resolution urgius; the state, conn-,
ty and municipal oftuiais to resume
all work which was abandoned for the
duration of the war, thus giving em-
ploy nit nt to men who otherwise might '
be forced out of jobs owinji to la-k .
of work.
T':ie resolution follows:
Whereas. The I'nitei States govern-j
ment. through Its department ot" labor. 1
has decided to encourage as much as i
pcosible the resumption of ali work
which was discontinued by reason of
the war; and.
Whereas. Because of such cessation
of work thousands of employes were ;
deprived ot their positions and obliged!
to seek employment at c;her cccupa--ticus;
therefore.
Be it Resolved, Tha: now. war hav-.
j ing ended, this body urge upon the
state, county and municipal officials,",
to resume at once the work which
was discontinued soon after the war;
began, and further, j
Be it resoled. That this body ur?.e ;
these officials to begin ail new workj
possible so as to give employment to
the" citiiens of this state in order to 1
avoid a depression iu business; aud. j,
Be it Resolved. That a committee
of five be appointed by this body to
present this resolution to the proper
authorities at once.
Afraid of Wife,
Pays for Decree
Then Makes Up
"Judge, I wouldn't live with that
woman another minute. I'm afraid
of her," said a Mexican entering
the court room of Justice of the
Peace James Allison Monday, lu
one hand the man carried a butch
er knife while from his wrist a
trickle of blood was running. He
claimed that his wife had at
tempted to kill him with the knife.
He did not wish to have her ar
rested, however, a divorce was
what he wanted.
Judge Allison told "him to see a
lawyer. The man did so and aft
er a short time came back with
the triumphant announcement
that he had given a lawyer $25
as a retainer and suit for divorce
would be filed at once.
Yesterday the same man ap
peared. He looked embarassed and
after a moment or two stammer
ed out:
"Judge, you kuow I feel sorry
for that woman. I guess I don't'
want a divorce after all." The
court again directed him to see
his lawyer and the man retumea
shortly afterward, poorer by the
amount of his retainer which had
gone for nothing, but on his way
home to make up his family, dif
ferences. REVIEW WANT ADS
