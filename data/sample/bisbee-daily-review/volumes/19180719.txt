AROUND SOISSONS
ON THE FRENCH FRONT IN
FRANCE. July 18 (By the Associ
ated Press) Evening. The French
American attack along ttv broad
front north of the Marne, was an
absolute surprise. Many German
officers were captured while
asieep and number of the men
were taken while harvesting rye.
The greatest stupification was cre
ated among all the enemy troops
holding the lines at the sudden at
tack. Some of the prisoners de
clared they had been told that it
was impossible for the allies to
carry out any operation in the way
cf an offensive for some time.
Many tanks participated in the
attack, having been able to take
ift their positions during the ter
rific storm which prevailed.
The American troops, co-operating
with their French comrades in the as
sault, did brilliant work.
Around Courchamp. northwest of
T'jntean Thierry, the Germans' resist
ance was more obstinate than on any
other part of the Paris line. In this
region the allies captured 10 cannon,
numerous machine guns and large
numbers of prisoners who have not
yet been counted.
The allied troops showed wonderful
spirit and advanced singing. A bat
talion of infantry "crossed the river
Savieres breast high in water.
UNDATED WAR LEAD BY THE!
APSOCITED PRESS. From the re
gion west of Soissons to the north
west of Chateau Thierry, American
and French armies have begun a
strong offensive against the Germans,
which possibly may have a marked in
fluence on the future of the world
war. It its initial stage the movement
has been rewarded with great success.
All along the twenty-five miles the
French and American troops have
dashed in brilliant fashion across po
sitions held by the Germans, killing,
wounding or capturing thousands of
the enemy and taking towns, villages
and large quantities of guns and other
war supplies.
Nowhere, according to last accounts
from the front, has the enemy been
able to stay the progress of their as
sailants, although counter attacks were
resorted to on some important sectors
after the first stages of surprise oc
casioned by the unexpected attack had
worn away.
To the Americans alone in the re
gion west of Soissons came 4000 pris

were taken by the French. Before all

French their guns and machine guns

OX THE FRENCH FRONT IN
FRANCE. July 18 (By the Associated
Press). When the entente allies' at
tack began at dawn today the Ger
mons were surprised and offered slight
resistance in the advanced lines, many
immediately throwing up fheir arms
and sliouting "Kamerad."
The barrage fire preceeded the
waves of infantry, but one of the heavi
est storms of the year drowned the
noise of the shells.
Most of the Germans had taken shel
ter in their dugouts' from the deluge
and the entente allied troops were
among them with grenades and bay
onets before they had time to turn
around.
Many prisoners are coming In.
The entente allied troops are dis
playing the utmost fervor in the at
tack, their desire being to strike a
strong blow in return for the recent
German assault.
It is the first occasion this year that
the entente allies have counter attack
ed on such a big front. Their opera
tion directly affects the position of the
German western flank and probably
will cause the German crown prince
to hurry some of hla reserves to the
scene of the fighting from the Marne
and the Champagne where yesterday
and today everything was quiet.
The Germans have widely announc
ed that their armies were engaged in
an offensive war movement. This op
eration eives them the other side of
such warfare In which the allies have
taken the initiative.

READING HIGHLY PLEASED
(V.v Itfv!-w Wire)
WASHINGTON, July IS. Lord
Reading. British ambassador to the
United States today expressed to The
Associated Press his gratification at
the success of the Franco-Ai.ierican
troops in their offensive launched be
tween Chateau Thierry. and Soissons
"I am very gratified," Raid the am
bassador, "by the news of the battle to
day and especially by the admirable
work of the American troops. That
was what we all looked for, but it wej
none the le.-.s gratifying to know that
our expectations had been realized."
'Continued from Page One)
from General Pershing." Mr. Baker
said, "official confirmation of the op
ening of the counter offensive along
the line indicated in the newspaper
dispatches. American troops are par
ticipating both as complete divisions
and as uuits in association with tlu
French.
"The first objectives seem every
where to have been attained. No accu
rate count has been made but it is
clear that many prisoners have been
taken and many guns and much war
material.
The most promising consideration
of the counter attack, officers be4iec
aside from renewed proof of the fight
ing qualities of the new American
armies is the fact that General Foch
now has sufficient force to unloose a
major counter stroke, for the blow to
day is nothing less than that, however,
limited Its fixed objectives for today
may have been. The supreme com
mander now has shown clearly that a
definite turning point has been reach
ed where his resources in men and mu
nitions are great enough for him to
assume at least an aggressive defense.
Whether the present counter stroke
will enlarge into an allied offensive
cannot be known until the events of
the next few days are known. If the
present Franco-American thrust
should realize all the possibilities seen
in it by observers abroad and force
the Germans out of the whole Aisne
Marne salient it seems highly probable
to officials here that General Foch
might feel warranted in expanding
that success through offensive opera
tions dn other fronts. A narrower con
struction on today's events fixes the
stopping of the German drive west of
Rheims as the purpose of the allied at
tack. Iu that case it is nlready certain
that what was accomplished today wil!
go far toward ending any menace the
German assault may still have.
It was suggested tonight that a
thrust on the British front on a wider
scale than anything attempted there
since the great German assault began
last March might develop as a" com
panion piece to the Franco-American
effort. In that case it was said, it
would bo clear that the tide of battle
had definitely turned and the German
drive of 1918, their greatest military
effort of the war and the campaigu
on which they have counted to achieve
victory by arms, had been defeated.

J fRv Review Leased Wire)
LONDON, July IS. Renter's corre
spondent at French headquarters in
France suggests that the complete sur
prise of the enemy by the Franco
American attack was due partly to
lack of vigilance, owing to violent
thunderstorms and the rain and wind
which swept the whole country be
tween the Aisne and Marne during the
night. The German first lines, the
correspondent says, made weak resist
ance and mnay prisoners were taken
in the first hour of the attack.
The correspondent predicts stiffer
fighting Friday when he believes
masses of unused German troops be
yond the Aisne will be brought up.
"The operation may be regarded as
a big diversion of the enemy salient
between the Aisne and the Marne
with a view to arresting his advance
toward Epernay and Rheims," says the
correspondent. "It was the first time
since the German offensive began on
March .21 of the development of an in
dependent .maneuver which obliged
the Germans- to give battle on ground
of General Foch's choosing. The
changed situation is largely due to the
progressive diminution of the enemy's
superiority since March and the ar
rival of a powerful American contin
gent on the allied front."

GAIN IMPORTANT POSITIONS
LONDON. July 18 The great
counter attack in which the French
and American troops are participates
between the Aisne and the Marne has
succeeded extremely well, according
I to the latest advices received here to
night, and the situation for many rea
sons is considered extremely promis
ing. Owing to fie fart that there was no
artillerv preparation, the pctlon was
a complete surprise for the boehe, and
the enemy artillery reaction wa very
weak. On the ether hand the French
counter battery work was exceedingly
effective. Enemy aviators entered Into
the action and attempted to impe-?
the advance, using their machine guns
at a low altitude.
Notwithstanding this, the counter at
tack was not wcrthv for the reason
that the French offensive accomp
lished a great deal more than wns
achieved hv the German drive on both
sides of Rheims.
The length of the front over which
an advance was made was practically
the same, and the French and Amer
icans .working together advanced in
six hours virtually double the distance
covered by the Germans in three days.
So far as known at present the
junction line between Soii-sons and
Oulchy Le Chateau and also the junc
tion line between Soissons and Fisnies
are under direct observation and fire
from the new French positions on the
Crise ravine. These two are the only
lines bv which the Germans in this
salient between Soi-isons and Rhe:ms
can be supplied. It is possible, how
ever, that the Germans may .have suc

The Fifth Offensive
' It is too soon yet to write with certainty
about the fifth German offensive. In fact,
after three days of fighting, the situation
is most confusing to this column. This
drive is vastly different from any of its
predecessors. . Reports from the battle are
vague and conflicting, both those from Ber
lin and those from Paris. While the head
line writers are claiming a great victory for
the allies, and more especially for the
Americans, and consequently a disastrous
check for the Prussians, this column can
not see it that way.
While the Germans made a demonstra
tion along a sixty mile front from Chateau
Thierry to the Argonne, yet it does not de
velop that they made any determined effort
to advance except as a few points along
this line. And at most of these places
where they tried to break through they
seem to have been more or less successful.
Only east of Rheims were they really held
in check. But at a most vital part of the
line along that intense salient that runs al
most straight into the French positions
from Rheims to Chateau Thierry, the fur
thest advance of the enemy, he crossed the
Marne at many places in spite of all re
sistance, and advanced as far as six miles
before being checked. Now this advance
tends to blot out the Rheims salient for the
allies and, if held, may well force their re
tirement from the cathedral city. And this
may well have been the object of this last
drive.
An offensive that takes and holds ground
to a depth of six miles cannot be much of
a victory for the defenders.
Now comes the question of the cost.
The. allies claim to have inflicted immense
losses upon the Germans. . Let us hope
that these claims are borne out by the facts.
But it is very hard to accurately compute
your enemy's losses during a great battle.
They can only be estimated by the casual
ties inflicted upon certain units.
Really, getting right down to the fact,
it seems that the allied claims of success are
based mainly upon the fact that this drive
did not gain as much ground as the previous
strokes.. This was expected to be the great
est German effort of the war. And based
upon this belief, the success in stopping
them so soon, may well be counted a vic
tory. But it has not yet clearly developed
that Germany has jhrown her full strength
of offensive into this drive'. It seems to
have been, in most places along the line,
an artillery rather than an infantry battle.
If the offensive is stopped finally where
it now stands, it will undoubtedly result in
an allied triumph. But a further advance
on from the Marne in that Rheims-Chateau
Thierry salient means the loss of precious
ground for the French. It means another
German step towards Paris; a better posi
tion; a stronger place for the jump-off of
the next drive.
Not until the allies inflict losses that will
enable them to make a real counter stroke
against these advancing hosts can they
make any claims except for a valiant and
undiscourasred defense. General Boehm
has thrown an army of some 50,000 men
across the Marne and their bayonets are
thrust into, the allied lines for a depth of
some six miles. The correspondents write
that they are in a precarious position if the
allies can counter attack with real force.
BUT, they still hold their positions. They
form a menace to the present allied line.
The only real counter attack the first
three days of the batttle was that made by
the Americans. This was a bright light in
the haze. In fact, the showing of the
Americans was a feature of the week's bat
tle. It is too soon to judge, and certainly
'too soon to boast, but the promptness and
firey energy of that American counter at
tack at Fossoy should be a revelation to the
allied generals in the matter of combatting
a German drive. To counter AT ONCE
seems to be the most effective plan of hold
ing ground. The Americans held about
ten miles of the sixty mile battle front, and
they certainly fought as well as anyone
along that line. They lost some ground
and gained back part of their lost positions.
The world was watching these troops fight
ing their first great battle. The result must
be thrilling to Paris and London and most
depressing to Berlin.
Make no mistake ; in one sense this last
offensive has been a real allied success.
They have held a German drive that was
a month or more in the making. BUT.
was it a major German effort? It is too
soon yet to tell.
NOTE: Since the above was written the
night dispatches; narrate a Franco-American
(Say, that compound word sounds
good!) offensive upon a scale of consider
able magnitude has been launched on the
north leg of that German salient that tips
Chateau Thierry. The German gains are
on the south leg of the same salient. The
allies made fine gains. Their thrust will
doubtless still further disrupt the great
German drive. In fact, as the hours go by,
the German effort seems to bear a decided
resemblance to the late Austrian offensive
against Italy. Quick counter attacks on the
largest scale possible and with every ounce
of power of the defenders seem to be the
antidote for the German poison germ. The
real succesj and significance of this recent
counter stroke cannot be gauged at this
time. Events are coming on thick and fast
in France. More and more does the ad
dition of that quarter of a million American
troops loom up as a factor that may soon
turn the tide in the 1 9 1 8 campaign.
GIVE THE PUBLIC THE FACTS
(From fie Tucson Citizen)
When the board of pardons and paroles turns
a man tr woman cut of the state prison, the
public and particularly t.e residents of the county
from which the prisoner was sent up. seldom
hear of the release, unless some newspaper re-
porter happens to stumble on it. '
On Monday there was published in Tha Phoe
nix Gazette the story of the parole of Dr. Rosa
Boido of Phcenix. The story was just thirty
' days old. On many occasions prisoners sent up
, from Pima county have boon back peratiing the
streets for several weeks before the pub'ic gen
erally was advised throug'i the press of their
pardon or parole.
These are matters which should be given full
publicity. A law should be passed by the next
legislature providing that when application is
made by a prisoner for a pardon or parole, notice
of the hearing should be published at least ten
days in the county from which he was scnt'up.
The law should also provide fiat when paroles
are granted, a report of the same should be sup
plied the newspapers at the capita and the news
papers in the county frcai which the prisoner
was sent up, together with a short statement of
the reason for the action.
The rirdcn and parole board may have good
reason for its action in these cares and nAy
.-fare no intention of concealing anything from
ihe public and can show its good faith by volun
tarily . furnishing this iniormation to the press
and through it to the public.
In this same connection might be men
tioned the pardon of Mrs. Ernie James,
sent up for murderous assault for five years
from Cochise county and set free by the
pardon board after serving thirty days of
her sentence, and thi3 unknown even to the
judge or posecutor or jury or people of
the county at large until days after she had
gone free. It would seem' that a board of
pardons should do its work in due form
and process and in the full light of publicity,
like a court of law. Neither conviction or
pardon should be arrived at without warn
ing or deliberation or all the form and cere
mony of law. t
It was estimated the other day by an ex
pert that when the German drive started
last March that the British had a million
men in the battle line, the French a million
and a quarter and the Belgians and Portu
gese about 100,000. making 2,350,000
allied troops in all. Opposed to these were
2,500,000 Germans, with a quarter of a
million available in reserve. Well, here
was nearly a half million balance in favor
of the kaiser. But since that time a quar
ter of a million Americans have been placed
in the battle line, and certainly more than
100,000. English and 100,000 Italian
troops. A second quarter of a million
Americans will be available for battle by the
middle of August. So we have more than
restored the balance of power on this front."
It is estimated that at the most Germany
cannot muster quite three million men on
the western battle line this year. The allies
will surely have well over three million by
September. So Germany MUST strike a
shattering blow now or give up the offen
sive forever in this war. These figures are
not official, but they are at least authorita
tive and as nearly correct as available at
this time. They are given here to correct
some wild guesses and apprehensions re
garding the German strength, and too much
pessimism or optimism regarding the
American strength. Another thing; we
have 1,100,000 men in France but of these
not more than 800,000 are fighting men.
One-third of these are now at the front and
another third will be available by August
1 5 and the remainder by January 1 .
Political Gossip
! With his nomination nptitlntm filed
in the office -of the secretary of state,
and with the end of the first lap of his
tour of the state In the interest of his
candidacy for nomination In the demo
cratic primaries as governor. Senator
Fred Sutter, of Bisbee and the Warren
district, returned to his home yester
day a' noon to spend the next two
days resting and preparing for the
final preliminary tour of the state.
While on the trip which he has Just
concluded he visited Pima, Maricopa,
Yavapai, Apache, Navajo, Mojave and
Coconino counties. On his next trip
he will make a complete tour of the re
maining counties of the state.
Senator Sutter returned to the War
ren djstrict satisfied completely witn
his first political trip through the
state. In every district, he reports lie
found, a people willing and ready to
listen'to him and to be convinced. In
terest in the five-cornered govemor'3
race, he found, is fast beginning to
take shape and residents of every p'art
of the state are now preparing to "go
to bat" for the men of their choice.
"In every city in which I stopped,"
said Senator Sutter last evening, "I
found the sentiment for me very
strong. 1 have many active supporters
in all parts of the state, and I find
that citizens in every village, town and
city are assisting me. I was really sur
prised at the ready reception 1 re
ceived and the number of unsolicited
pledges of support.
"I have been making my campaign
strictly on my record and my ability.
I have invited discussion of the many
problems with which the government
of thi3 state i3 confronted, and I have
remained staunch in the defense of tho
planks of my platform in all my' rela
tions with the voting public. I have
never adopted the policy of changing
my attitude on public questions to suit
the occasion, and I will not waver from
the stand 1 have taken to gain one or
ten thousand votes.
" Each of my opponents has strength
In some or another part of the state,
and I have met many staunch sup
porters of one or another of the fiv
of us in the race. How the stale will
decide in the democratic primaries ia
beyond the guess or estimate o! even
the most astute Arir.ona politician, but
I am firmly convinced that when the
returns are counted on September lo.
I shall be nominated by a tidy vote."
Dusiiicss conditions abcut the state,
declares Senator Sutter, aro excellent.
In the Salt river valley the farmers
are meeting with the success they de
serve after their years of toil to make
their project what it has become. The
cotton crops throughout the Roosevelt
propect district are flourishing and
hcanhy. Farmers are cutting rich
yields of wheat and corn and maiz-3
and hay. Cattle are in prime condition.
The melon crops are heavier than ever
in the past and shipments of canta
loupes and watermelons this year will
shatter all termer records.
In the north Senator Sutter reports,
conditions of the business men aie
prosperous. Mojave county is experi
encing a healthy growth in the mining
industry. Sesides, the cattle ranger
are in tine shape and the cattlemen
this year will have a record sersun.
In Apuche, Navajo and Coconino coun
i.es me cattle are thriving a:u ranges
are good with pro-pecta for be.ier
grass in evidence. Yavapai county is
continuing tne healthy mining and cat
tle growtn hich has marked iia pro
cess in tne past several yeais, aru is
snowing in its business activity grer.t
results in development. On July 4, Sen
ator Sutter was a guest at ihe cele
bration staged in Pieeeott and at
tended bv many cattlemen and cow
boys. He met and talked with many
ot me cattlemen ot the county at tn.s
time. Pima county is more active and
prosperous than he has ever seen it,
bays Senator Sutter, and Tucson is
one of the booming, busy and prosper
ous cities of the state.
Throughout the state politics is be
coming more and more active each
day, declares Senator Sutter, and in
spite of the war conditions and the
interest people are taking in the great
werk of the Americans on the French
front, citizens of the state find time
to discuss the. merits of the various
candidates for state and county of
fices. I find a sentiment throughout in-,
state," said the senator, "that employ
er and employee are partners in the
winning of the war and in advocating
and encouraging measures and princi
ples which will assist the l'nite:
States in the prosecution of the war.
It is a sentiment of harmony, co-operation
and mutual trust which will go
far toward assuring maximum effort
ar.d production in all branches of in
dustry in the state. The same senti
ment seems to be crystalizing in the
race ior governor, and conservative
working men are preparing to suppori.
conservative candidates In all otilics.
I believe that the choice of the demo
crats for all offices this fall will be
made bv all citizens co-operating to
secure businesslike, statesmanlike,
economical, thorough, fair and Amer
ican officials."

Norton Recommends All
Insurance by Companies
Be on Co-operative Basis
Millions of dollars would have been
saved property owners ?n cities of Ari
zona during the last ten years if they
had (riven heed to effort started by
Fire Chief Barney Norton of this city, j
advocate of cooperative insurance for
the protection of property in each in
corporated community, who is now
completing, figures on fire insurance
premiums paid by Arizona people in
the last fiscal year and reaching an
astonishing total.
"I still advocate cooperative local in
surance with proper control," says
Norton. "It would save to the state
hundreds of thousands of dollars each
year for usage in the development of
Arizona. Classification, fair to all, set
forth clearly, for which the aniend
pent now offered to provide state in
surance for injured workmen offers a
good example and will have the same
influence in keeping money at home,
could be so arranged as to both fully
protect and advance the interests of
all concerned. While the foreign cas
ualty insurance companies probably
do not draw as much frcm the state
annually as do the fire insurance com
panies, I would say that between the
two, protecting her prcperty and her
injured workmen, Arizona would keep
more than two million dollars at home
each year that is now absolutely lost
to it and given to the development of
other parts of the country."
MEAT OFFERING
QUITE SERIOUS
WORLD PROBLEM
Population of World Increas
ing More Rapidly Than
Supply of Meat for Feeding
Additional Mouths
WASHINGTON, Jtfly IS. With the
population of the world Increasing fast
er than- the growth in the meat supply,
government experts forsee a serious
problem to be solved in the not far dis
tant future.
The situation in the United States
has reached an interesting stage. With
in the last ten years, the population
has increased about 18 per cent while
the herds of the nation which brought
the meat industry to its present high
development have declined 20 per cent
In Europe the condition is even more
serious because of depletion due to the
war. Australia and New Zealand con
tinue to produce great quantities of
meat, but the distance to the congested
centers of population adds much to the
expense of marketing. South Ameri
ca's vast field3 and splendid herbage,
therefore, are being looked to as the
source of supply, now as well as after
Die war.
Argentina is today the most import
art beef producing country In the
world, according to a review of meat
packing in South America by the Latin-American
Division cf the Bureau of
Kcreign and Domestic Commerce. Ur
uguay also is becoming a center of the
industry and Rraz.il. Paraguay, Colom
bia and Venezuela to a less extent.
Out of a total of 915.047 tons of beef,
mutton and lamb produced in 1915. Ar
gentina produced 436.405 tons, N?w
ZealEnd and Australia 252,175 tons,
the United States $0,522 ten?. I"rua
guay 43.S95 to,ns, Brazil 3.".. 571 .tons,
Canada 21.723 tens and other coun
tries the remainder.
Development of cattle breeding in
South America has been a direct re
sult of the discovery of refrigeration.
Until the practice of freezing meat was
introduced, South American commerce
in meat was negligible, being confined
to the shipment of low grade smoked
cr salted beef, for which there was
little sale. When American and Brit
ish capital established plants in Argen
tina and Uruguay, and later in other
countries for freezing or chilling meat
so that it could'be shipped frech
across the ocean, commanding high
prices and being in great demand, nat
ive ranchmen began to improve their
stock by the introduction of thorough
breds. As a result, millionaire ranchmen in
Argentina and Uruguay are almost as
plentiful as millionaire oil men in Ok
lahoma. Frozen meat is being used
extensively by the allied armies and
the flow of gold in the world s com- j
merce has been showing an increasing
trend toward South America. ,
Heat packing in Argentina has been !
so successful because it was spared
the hardships which a new industry
usually encounters. Profiting by Am
erican experience, the plants were es
tablished along modern lines without
costly experiment. A market already
ha1 been created in Kurope by the
shipment of frozen meat from the Un
ited States. Argentina is now seekine
to increase her herds to keep p?.ce
v ith the capacity s of the parking
bouses, while Brazil Is endeavoring to
augment the number of packing hous
es to handle the plentiful supply of
stock. The Brazilian government is
giving every encouragement to breed
ers to improve their strain of cattle.
CoU mbia has offered a subsidy of
10.00 lbs. to the first packing house
established in that country. Colombia
has approximately i. 000,000 head of
cattle, which can be exported now only
on the hoof. American, British and
Swedish firms are reported to be in
vestigating the sibsidy . offer.

The Huns really believed that
America was so obsessed with busi
ness activities that we would not
fight when the show-down came.
Furthermore, that if we did attempt
to ser.d an army, we would lack the
spirit and morale so necessary to a
successful compaign.
The first contact the Germans had
with the Americans was when the
Marines, battling like veterans, swept
the Huns back at Cantipny and
Chateau Thierry. All alonj? the
line the Jlarines have upheld their
'First to Fiphk" slogan.
A prominent officer of the Ma
rine Corps recently made the re
mark that it is the spirit that is
early instilled in the Marines that
semis them to certain victory.
The wonderful intensive training
given the Marines in their camps
in America, and in France before
t':icy pro to the front line, has been
remarked upon by the Army offi
cers during this war on a number of
occasions.
Every mode ci modern war-fare
is gone into, and the men are taught,
through their drills, to practice as
they are expected to fight. The
methods pursued by the Marines,
end the results accomplished, are rU
trading thousands of young r.."n in
to this Branch of the service all
over the country, and the Los An

BY REVIEW
NEW YORK, July IS The news
that American t roups had victoriously
advanced in the western front promot
ed an almost unpuralloled outburst of
enthusiasm on the r'oar of the stok
exchange today, llrokers yelled and
cheered and bought stocks. Prices
soared.
Thc market, which took a sharp up
ward trend almost at the opening, re-1
mained active, with still rising prices.!
until the closing hour, when as ;he
success of the allied drive beca'ne
more ful'ty known the buying became
still more vigorous.
The spirit c- . optimism spread
throughout the financial district, bank
ers and brokers remaining at their
offices lonp a iter the close of the
market in their desire to receive late
war bulletins.
A highly significant feature of the
bond market was the acticity and
strenpth of foreign war flotations, es
pecially Paris sixes, which rose three
points. Issues or this class have al
ways been extremely sensitive to
changes in the foreign military situa
tion. The advance in Ftocks encompassed
all the active issues in the several war
groups, as well as numerous special
ties of a semi-war character.
MARKET IS BULLISH
NEW YORK. July 18. The stock
market assumed bullish proportionsto-
uay on lue surninj war n, me url,

and American forces. -

night and the main substantial gains
were held, despite occasional selling
for profits.
I'nited States Steel as ustfal over
topped il! other stocks, contributing
more than 25 per cent of the total
transactions at its final price o 10S'-4.
which represented a net gain of 3vs
points.
Baldwin locomotive, Mexican petrol
eum. Industrial alcohol, American
steel foundaries, Reading and Cana
dian Pacific embraced the other promi
nent stocks at extreme pains of 3 to
5 points. Sales amounted to 610,000
shares.
French municipals were the feature
of the firm bond market. Paris sixes
advancing three points. Total sales,
par value, aggregated $6,100,000. Old
United States bonds were unchanged
on call.
GRAIN MARKET
CHICAGO, July is Rapid down
ward plunges took place in the corn
market today owing largely to sweep-
in:? success of the entente offensive.!
Prices closed heavy. 3. to 4Vi net
lower, with August $1.55 to $1.56
and September $1.56 to $1.56.
Oats lest to cents. In pro
visions, the outcome varied from a
shade decline to 5 cents advance. Gen
eral selling by all classes of traders
developed as soon as the magnitude
of the allies success had been placed
be von d reasonable doubt. The ex- j
treme break from the top level of the
day amounted in pome cases to 54
cents a bushel. Seaboard buying and
dry weather reports from Canada kept
the oats market relatively steady.

Thos. H. Ince's great cinema spec,
tacle "Civilization." one of the most
astounding and daring productions the
world has ever known, will be shown
at the Eagle theater today and tomor
row, this picture was over one year in
the making, containing some of the
most expensive settings ever used in
Diotion pictures, over 40.000 people em
ployed, entire cities built and destroy
ed. Ten thousand horses in thrilling
cavalry charges. Forty aeroplanes in
great air battles. A submarine de
stroys and sinks a loaded passenger
ship in mid ocean and the wonderful,
gripping story holds you tense and
breathless from start to finish. It will
be remembered at a previous show
ing of Civilization in Bisbee the top
price of admission charged was one

at the Eagle at the regular admission

A BAD MAN WITH A REASON
Most or the villains we have had in
photoplays from the very beginning of
the film industry have been the "utter
villains of tradition. They have been
bad iust on general principles. Doug
Ins Fairbanks, however, his come to
the rescue with an innovation in "The
Good Bad Man," a Triangle feature
which he wrote himself, and in which
he is starred at the Central today.
The bad man here is a most likable
young chao, whose depredations take
ecentric channels. For instance, he
holds up the Pacific Limited, and robs
the conductor of his ticket punch.
Again, he holds up the town grocer
and robs him of quantities of food
which he bestbws upon a friendless
little orphnn who lives on the out
skirts of civilization.
Chuni drilling is now golns on at
the Little A.io mine.

Near Ray Camp
FLAGSTAFF. - July IS. Hundreds
of pounds of hoarded supplies of sugar
and flour were confiscated and four
Mexicans, whose names for the pres

sult of a raid conducted by govern
ment officers at Sonora. a Mexican

trict, i
The clean-up of the Mexlcun hoard
ers was one of the most successful
ever carried out in this RtatJ. and its
effect will be to implant a wholesome
respect for Vncle Sam's food adminis
trations in the breants of those cer
tin foreigners who were inclined to
look upon them as a joke.
Hoarding was something akin to
bootlegging .with these simple minds.
It was perfectly legitimate an long as
one could get away with it. but that
viewpoint has been altogether
changed. Sonora today ran take fcnu
ine pride, in strict compliance with nil
the regulations, for Sonorans have dis
covered that the food control act really
i has teeth. Neither jr(too fines nor
two-year imprisonments look inviting
and they have promised the officers t.
i be "muy bien" in the future.

under the personal direction of V. E.

Mexicans and negroes. For some time
past it has been regarded as a hot-bed
of food violators and has given the
officers considerable trouble in other
re.ipccts. Though it was felt that there
was more or less violation of the food
regulations, however, it was difficult
to secure concrete evidence. Finally
this was obtained quite by accident.
On July 6 the county food adminis
trator issued a certificate to one, Leo
cardio I'once, allowing him fifty
pounds of sugar for the manufacture
of ire crjam. On the same night
Ponce's place of business was visit
ew by officers in search of liquor.
Among other things they found the
fifty-pound sugar certificate and with
it 250 pounds of sugar. This was sack
ed in ten-pound bags and hidden away
In ess cashes.
It was this circumstance that led
Mullen to call for federal assistance.
The federal food administrator for Ari
zona sent a secret service officer to
the scene and the raid was carried
out by the officers visiting several es
tablishments simultaneously.
What action will be taken against
the hoarders has not yet been deter
mined. All are held under surveillance
and in the meantime Scnora is patrio
tically inclined.
On July 16 the federal food adminis
trator for Arizona issued an order
closing the place of business of
Charles Quam, proprietor of the Amer
ican Kitchen at Mesa for three days
and imposing a fine of tH to be paij
to the Red Cross.
In a hearing held before S. J. Buck
ingham, county food administrator for
Maricopa county. Quam was tound
guilty of having violated certain regu
lations of the hotel'and restaurant di
vision with reference to the serving
of sandwiches and the sale of bread.
This was deemed to be in unfair com
