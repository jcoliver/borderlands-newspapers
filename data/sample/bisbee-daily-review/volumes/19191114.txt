SENATE ADOPTS
ERUATIDN T
TENTH ARTICLE
Amendment Which Pres. Wil
son Said Would Cut Heart
Out of Covenant Is Passed
By a Majority of Thirteen
WASHINGTON, Nov. 13. Squarely
joining the issue with President Wil
son, the senate adopted today a reser
vation qualifying the obligations of
the United States under article ten
of the league of nations covenant.
A solid Republican lineup, rein
forced by four Democratic votes, put
the reservation across exactly as it
came from the foreign relations com
mittee, and in virtually the language
which the president declared .'on his
(western tour would 'cut' the heart out
oi the covenant, and mean theVejec
tion of the treaty. The vote by
which the reservation won was 4G to
33.
The fight for reservations having
thus been carried to a climax, the Re
publicans presented for future action
a cloture proposal designed to bring
final action on the question of ratifi
cation within a week. A less sweep
ing measure, proposing limitation on
the reservation debate only, had been
put in by the Democrats earlier in
the day, but rejected, when the Re
publicans voted to sustain a point of
order against it.
A vote on the question of clamping
down a cloture on debate will come
Saturday morning, and the Republi
can leaders say it will depend entirely
on the Democrats whether the wove
rallies the necessary two-thirds to
make cloture effective. The Demo
cratic leaders were not ready tonight
to say how they would vote, betng
fearful that agreement to so sweeping
a program might Imperil their
chances to secure actron 6h a ratifi
cation resolution of nter own.
The article, ten reservation as
adonted by the senate follows:
"The tnited states assumes no ob
ligation to preserve the territorial in
tegrity or . political independence of
any other countrv or to interfere with
controversies between nations

the Esch railroad bill. Each of the
provisions approved has far reaching

all of the provisions provoked sharp

In brief, the provisions approved

WASHINGTON, Nov. 13. (By the
Associated Press.) Large orders for
arms and ammunition placed by Mex
ico in Belgium and Spain, in prepara
tion for the possibility of American
intervention, came to light today
when the state department let it be
come known that the government had
j taken steps to prevent their shipment.

during the after-the-war transition
period, no such direct action is prob
able at Madrid.
The order in Belgium was placed
with the Fabrique Nationale d'Arms
at Liege, probably under the direction !
of Candido Aguilar, Vexcan minister
of foreign affairs, and President Car-
ranza's son-in-law, who went to
Europe recently, after stopping here
and placing a wreath on George
Washington's tomb at Mount Vernon.
The orders in Spain, which included
rifles, millions of rounds of ammuni
tion and a large number of machine
eruns. were negotiated through the
Mexican minister there, Eleseo Arrc
dondo, former ambassacor to the
United States, and President Carran
za's nephew.
The Spanish munitions, according
to information in the hands of the
government, began passing Into Mex
ico more than a vear ago. when the
European war still was going on and
in violation of the inter-allied em
bargo. Rifles and ammunition and
some sample machine guns are re
ported to have passed Havana on
their way to Mexico as rate as June
of this year
For later shipments, cargo space
had been reserved for October 19 on
Holland-American steamers sallin?
out of Antwerp, and further space had
been reserved for Tampico, Vera
Cruz and Puerto. Mexico, on Deeem-
ber 3.
The United States has been denving
shipments of arms and. ammunition
Into Mexico for manv months for the
reason that they srenerlly fell Into
the hands of bandits and often were
used against Americans. Soon af'er
the end of the war th Mexican so-1
ernment asked for the release or j
munitions bought in this country In I
1917. but it was refused.
Such information as has now come
into the hands of the eovernment
show that Mexico alreadv was turn

ALL FIGHTERS ON
EEI1 TRAINING IN EARNEST
Preparations for the fight program
which Is to be presented to Warren
district fistic fans at the Grand the
ater on Nov. 21 by the Bisbee Ath
letic club, under the management of
O. S. French, went on apace yester
day, especially among the boxers
themselves. All the eight boxers
who wi'l take part in the various
evrnts hava begun' their training, and
several of them are working out in
TMr.bi-p, with the Knights of Colum
bus gymnasium as the favorite place
of exercise. .
George Caldwell, the Albuquerque
middleweight who will meet Kid
George ia the main event, wived yes
terday for his transportation, which
was sent to him immediately by
Manager French. Caldwell will
leave for Bisbee today, it is believed,
and will begin training as soon as he
?cts here. With Caldwell in town,
every fighter on the program will bo
in the district by the lirsf of the
week.
Of interest to the fans will be the
announcement that Al Williams, who
refereed the Chambers-Celmars fight
here on Nov. 7. signed articles with
the Bisbee Athletic club yesterday to
rereree all the bouts here on Nov.
21. Williams made a very favorable
imriession here when he appeared
as third man in the ring when Cel
mars and Chambers fought, and his
work in Douglas, where he has ref
ereed all the bouts lately, has been
of a generally High character. His
willingness to referee all the four
bouts on the coming card will, it is
beiieved, stimulate the sport as
nothing else would.
While Williams will referee all the
bouts, the decisions in each battle
will be made by two judges, thus
taking .away from the reieree any of
the burden of making awards. This
plan has been tried by Manager
French in the main events, and it
has met with such general encour
agement that he will extend it to the
semi-final and the preliminaries.
Eldie Hughes, the hard-musled
and well-built challenger of Bob Col
lins, began working out yesterday at
the Knights of Columbus hall with
Kid George, who admitted after the
v.oikout that the boy from the South
west Fhaft carries a .punch- that
comes over like a blow from a dou-b'.e-jack.
Hughes appeared to be in
-;ood form yesterday, and undoubted
ly will be in excellent condition when
he meets tho pride of the Briggs
shaft in the person of Collins. The
latter will also be in the pink of con
dition, and his friends are banking
on his increasing cleverness and his
unquestioned ability to hit to bring
home the bacon. This fight looks as
good as the main event.
Kid George is working out daily at
the K. of C. hall. He wants this one
fight to settle any question of supe
riority between himself and Cald
well, and he is going to take no
chances with the Albuquerque middle-weight,
who is known throughout
the country as one of the best men
of his class now in the ring. George
has a reputation also to sustain, and
his fight with Caldwell is beginning
already to attract attention through
out the west.
Frank Ford and Al Mauch are
rounding into shape for their mill,
and Kid Higgins and Georgie Burns
of Lowell are also training every day.
In the general excellence of the card.
Manager French believes that he has
prepared the best program by great
odds that has been offered in Bisbee
for years, and that his belief is cor
rect is shown by the fact that reser
vations lor seats are being made al
ready, although the date is nearly 10
days away.

HAPPY WOODS MATCHED '
Happy Woods has been matched to
box Caveman Carlson in Tucson
Thanksgiving day. Carlson sent in a
challenge several days ago, and Karl
Moh&n, Happy's manager, announced
as soon as he saw it that he was will
ing. Art Shannon closed the match
with Carlson's manager Wednesday
noon. Carlson is a newcomer in the
game and his record is almost as good
as Happy's. Both are srrong, rugged
boys with mighty wallops. Carlson's
manager wanted the fightto take
place in Douglas, but it was decided
that as a financial proposition it
would draw better in Tucson. Art
Shannon figures that this match will
pack the house. He has had new
bleacher seats erectd and said that he
will have more by Thanksgiving. They
will probably be needed.

But it was a long time before 1 got
to go. 1 was in camp on this side for
17 long months. All of us were very
impatient, but things weren't so slow.
There was always some excitement
in camp. For four months 1 was with
the guardsmen who were on duty on
railroad bridges in West Virginia, and
then we were sent to Camp Shelby,
Miss., and was in the replacement di
vision the Thirty-eighth thirteen
months. I had a little boxing there.
Melvin Sheppard took a great Interest
I in me, but I didn't have a boxing in

I fought a big fellow from Indiana

the ring after the first round. Frank
Moran was over at Spartansburg then

a while we'd- get a little excrtement
along with the hard work. I was

a lieutenant fa fellow guardsman
from Virginia) had caught me with a
gang of fellows rolling the ivories. I
was the only sergeant in the bunch,
and Major Short thougnt tt would be
agood lesson. to "bust" me.
but later made me a sergeant.
Colonel Osborne asked me to ex
plain why it was there were so few
arrests on my beat.
"Other sergeants bring up three or
four a night," he said.
I told him I didn't believe in making
arrests unless there was a serious
charge to make. I never had to take
my gun out of my holster. When the
soldiers got too rough I used my fists,
and if they got unruly, I used a club.
One night I tried to arrest four fel
lows who were raising a rumpus in a
cafe. They started a fight, and I
knocked all four down with my fists.
Another fellow came running up, and
I let him have it, too.
He got up and dusted off his cloth

"What in h 1 is the matter with
you, Martin? I came up to help you."
So we dragged the four two apiece

The Phoenix Indian school football
tram suffered its second reverse of
the season at Miami Tuesday, when
tht) University of Arizona second
team walked off with tnerong end of
a 2S to 13 score.
Although outweighed several pounds
to the man, the redskins played a
plucky uphill battle, ancr for a sine,
it appeared that they were to emerge
vi'ttricus.
The forward pass materially aided
the Indians in scoring both touch
downs and they were able to do little
on line plays against the heavy uni

The game was the feature or the

The Hayden fight fans who gather
ed at the Rex theater last Friday
were treated to a whirlwind show.
Two knockouts and a decision
brought the scheduled 20 rounds
down to nine, but those nine rounds
were crowded with action, and there
was not a thill moment during the
evening.
The men w?re evenly matched, with
the exception of Kid Shirley and
Young Connely. The Kid put up a
game fight, but was hopelessly out
matched. The promoter of the fight
Is not wholly to blame for this, as he
had arranged the match by letter and
( Connely was underrated by the peo
ple who sought a fight for him.
1 The preliminary between Tex Wat
son and Glen Grant was the best fight
of the evening for the spectators, as
the boys mixed every minute, Watson
gaining a well-earned decision.
; The semi-final, Kid Shirley versus.
Young Grant, came to a Budden finish
In the second round when Shirley
took the count following a tremen
dous jolt to his jaw.
The final was a return matcn be
tween Louis Mendoza and Joe Con
way. Mendoza took the fight to Con
i way's corner right off the bell and
,'kept him there. It looked as though

badly punished, made a lucky swing
and connected with that rortlon of

A THOUGHT FOR THE DAY
"If we are not stupid or insincere when we say that the'good or
ill of man lie3 wilhin his own will and that all besides is nothing to
us, why are we still troubled ?" Epictetus.
THE INSECTS OF THE HOUR
1
DRALLY unclean men cannot for long live in juxtaposition with
men who are morally clean, any more than oil will mix with
water. The men of the American Legion post at Mesa have
taken a commendable step in the adoption' of a. resolution de
manding that the authorities take action for the ousting from Ari
zona of all I. W. W. and other radicals and denouncing the I. W. W.
murders of war heroes marching in an American Legion parade in
Centralis, Wash., on Armistice Day.
Arizona manhood, including so many of the brave men who of
fered their all for their country, and who are now, through the
Anterican Legion, striving to serve their flag as well in peace as
they did In war, cannot tolerate propinquity with the moral leper as
exemplified In the I. W. W. This state belongs to its strong, clean,
courageous men, and there is no room for the rodent-souled, flag
besmearing, American-murdering traitor within its borders.
As for the I. W. W. member himself, he is a man who has never
been touched by sunshine, love, laughter, sympathy or any of the
sentiments which bind humanity together in a common cause of
happiness. His sole business is seeking to destroy humanity's equi
librium and wreck its quest of happiness through -dark and cowardly
means, and in sheer evil delight in destruction and pain.
Should the milenniuin come tomoirow, the I. W. W. member
would bite himself to death in thwarted wrath over having nothing
left upon which to vent his hatred and spleen. He does not want
to see humanity betteTed; he battens like a maggot in parasitical
feeding upon all that is good in humanity.
The 1. W. W. has gained courage through listening to his own
noise. He has been emboldened to commit murder, and in so doing
has signed his own death warrant. The Centralia lesson has been
a ccstly one, but if has driven home to decent Americanism the
truth about the I. W. V., and decent Americanism needs only to
know, to act.
The I. W. W., having brought the issue to a head through its own
vile act, is in a fair way now to being stamped out. And those who
have been foolishly led, through mere noise, to believe that the evil
thing known as the I. W. W. ever represented, a real factor in Ameri
can life, beyond isolated and cowardly murder, will do well to con
sider the words of Edmund Burke, Briiish champion of the American
revolution, spoken apropos of another matter, but peculiarly appli
cable to the case of the I. W. W. today:
"Because half a dozen grasshoppers under a fern make the field
ring with their importunate chink, whilst thousands of great cattle,
reposed beneath the shadow of ,lhe oak, chew the cud and are silent,
pray do not imagine that those who make the noise are the only
inhabitants of the fi.?ld; that of course they are many in number or
that, after all, the yare other than the little shriveled, meagre, hop
ping, though loud and troublesome, insects of the hour."
BISBEE'S SPLENDID SCHOOL SYSTEM
TlIK report of the Bisbee truant olt'icer, published in this issue
of the Review, discloses that less than one-tenth of one per
cent of the children of the Bisbee schools indulged during the
last month in that supposedly popular pastime of the American
schoolboy known as "playing hookey."
Vho answer is simple good school system, in which an appeal
is made to the individuality of the child, and in which this individu
ality is developed, not stunted; result, no "hookey."
The Bisbee child gees to school not so much because of an alr
tight disciplinary system which forces him to go there though in
organized governmental efficiency tha. Bisbee schools are second to
none in the southwest as because in the school he finds, both in
subject mailer y.nd in methods of teaching, that which attracts him.
In the old, stern days of birchen rod and the "Three Its" learned
by rote, "hookey" was the rule( rather than the exception, in many
cases. The fault has never been with the child, but always with the
educational system.
Going to school, if the school is properly and rationally con
ducted, will be a natural attraction, not a natural repulsion, to the
child. The theory that it is natural for the growing organism to be
adverse to the acquisition of knowledge is a worn-out myth, belied
by the inquisitive spirit displayed in every normal child.
The faculty of the Bisbee schools are to be complimented not
so much for the discovery of this truth, which should be patent to
the dullest mind, as for that intelligent application of it which has
given this city an educational system which must be the pride of
every Bisbee citizen.
"DRY" ARIZONA
TO throw a civic stone while living in a civic glass house, the
city of Globe, Arizona, and it. authorities, should feel the
blush of shame at that 10,000 gallon haul of "moonshine" and
those 115 warrants which are the result of a two-day raid
conducted there by federal authorities. The finding of that much
liquor in one city in "dry" Arizona would be bad enough, even if
t life local authorities had found if; but, after Arizona has been sup
posedly dry under the state law for half a decade, to have the United
States representatives tep in and clean up the city alcoholically
under the impervious noses and sightless eyes of the local guardians
of the law is indeed a blow to the civic pride of Globe.
But if "misery loves company," Globe may take consolation in
the fact that she is not alone in her guilt, and that the federal
authorities are presumably men of persevering energy, with a wide
range of territory under their jurisdiction.
Globe has been guilty of the crime of being found out. There
is much more work ahead o fthe federal authorities, unless they are
anticipated by other authorities.
To the shame of "dry" states be it said, federal prohibition Is
a different matter than state prohibition.
A law. on the statute books, either municipal, state or federal,
which is not jnoant to be enforced, is a travesty on the right of
majority suffrage, upon which the American commonwealth ' is
founded.
A genius is a man with some ability who hasn't acquired (he

PEPY'S DIARY INBISBEE
Nov. 13. Up late, after working haid, and found that the head-line on
a perfectly good story of mine had beer, teetotally jazzoii, which put me in
such bad humor that even a short lecture from my wife concerning my own
shortcomings failed to stir me much. To town, where I heard much specu
lation about Douglas, the Philadelphia of the border, where the alarm
clocks are muzzled and sleeping towders sell at a premium; and whether
she is going to make a definite showing in the Red Cross drive, and much
betting that she will not get close enough to the quota to hit it with a
.30-.30. To the police station, where Bill Sherriil was still fighting the
Armistice Day program at Warren park, being in nearly the two hundredth
round, and still going strong. I think he will get the decision. Did hear
this day that a Bisbee genius is working on a mechanical referee that is to
be set up at all boxing contests and which will render automatic decisions
that are guaranteed to give satisfaction to each and every spectator. I fear
much that he is in the wrong town. To the Knights of Columbus hall, where
I watched Kid George work out, and I much impressed with him, so that I
think his battle with Caldwell will be a small edition of the Argonne Forest.
Bisbee now takes her place at the head of Arizona's musical ranks with a
wonderful series of recitals which I think I shall attend, especially if
Schumann-Heink appears, as I would rather listen to her make a speech
J than Galli-Curci trill '"Carmen" in a cabaret to the accompaniment of a
saxophone, which, indeed, would be a wonderful thing to hear. The sport

top with a -score of 117, and a friend of his at the Y .has advised him, I am

the expectation that he may notget any spares but out to twist over a
strike or two. To the office, where I met Mr. Zeh of Cananea, and we had

STOCKS AND BONDS
NEW YORK, Nov. 13. When call
money rate sbroke to six per cent in
the final hour of trading today, the
stock market rebounded from its row
levels and closed at appreciable ad
vances throughout the list. Trading
was heavy before the close, and many
stocks, notably motors, oils, steels,
equipments, affiliated incustrials, and
scores of ' miscellaneous specialties,
showed gains-for the day of rrom 5
to 20 points. Sales approximated 2,
200.000 shares
Rates for call loans held at 16 per
cent until about 2 o'clock. Then they
broke to 12 and rapidly went to 6, the
the normal rate. This wa3 believed
' to mark the passing of the stringent
money period. Leaders in the spirited
rally which followed were the ssues
which broke most severely yesterday
and day before.
The market wa steadier at the
opening today, but the initial high
rates for call money caused an
avalanche of selling in the next hour
or so.
One of the leaders of the spirited
rally was General Motors, which open
ed at a 15-point rise, only to lose its
advantage and finally advanced by
leaps and bounds to 3rr, an trireme
recovery of 45 points. Mexican Pe
troleum, in which support seemed al
most altogether lacking yesterday,
rose more than 30 points.
Trading in bonds was confusing,
recessions in industrials bemg Bal
anced by the strength or ras. liber
ty issues made up part of their early
heaviness. Total sales, par value,
$17,850,000. Old United States, bonds
were unchanged on call.'
NEW YORK, Nov. 13. Indications
that stable conditions in the money
market may soon be restored and con
current signs that the 'bears" or
short interest .had over-extended their
position, caused a vigorous rally in
the stock market today.
In several noteworth ymstances
from one-third to one-half of the re
cent severe price depreciations were
recopered. while !n a few isolated
cases the rebound was carried to
greater lengths.
This improvement was not effected,
however, until several of the better
known speculative shares were de
pressed to lower levels than those
reached in the demoralized markets
of the two preceding sessions.
The unsettlement which succeeded
the early rally was mainly due t.i the
first auotations for call money, ihete
being fixed at the new maxin.uais of
15 to 16 per cent.
The 16 per cent rate prevailed unMl
the last hour, when offering of sur
plus supplies by brokers, whos
money holdings exceeded their re
quirements, forced the rate down to
12 per cent, with 6 per cent the nor
mal rate "ruling at the close.
GRAIN MARKET
CHICAGO. Nov. 13. Corn advanced
in price today, strengthened by the
upward movement of the New York
s'ock market and by scarcity of rural

THE PRICE IS MOT
THE MOST
important consideration of an automobile, but VALUE
IS. This sums up the policy of the Dort Motor Com
pany in perfecting the DORT CAR. The price of the
DORT is not PROHIBITIVE, but it is sufficient to
include important features that cheaper cars do not
have. At the same time it is much lower in price than
other cars which possess those features. It will, there
fore, satisfy the purchaser who has paid more for a
car in the past, while to him who has paid less it will
prove an unexpected revelation.
A VISIT TO THE BISBEE AUTO COMPANY
to inspect the newly arrived DORT CARS will well
repay the prospective automobile purchaser.

Judge llogan yesterday afternoon on
charges of disturbing the peace.
According to IVtroln.iin C. T. Hag

created a disturbance' late Wednes

loud talking and a brand of singing
that could be heard far down the
Naco road.
The boys were found guilty by
Jude Hogan and were fined $10
each. The fine was suspended, how
ever, under promises of good behav
ior hereafter on the pari of the
boys, the judge making the point
that the suspension of the sentence
came chiefly because of the youth
of the defenders.
To Discuss Roads
At Board Meeting
The attention of the residents of
Cochise county was called yesterday
to the meeting of the boarJ of su

will come up for discussion. It is
rumored that Supervisor Roberts has
a joker in his sleeve which he in
tends to slip in the deck during the
meeting a supposition which is
strengthened, in the opinion of many,
by his announcement that he will
be a candidate for the governorship
at the next election.
