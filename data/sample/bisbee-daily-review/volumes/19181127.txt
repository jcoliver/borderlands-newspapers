WASHINGTON, Nov. 26. News
from France today that the 27th and
SOthe divisions, which have been fight
ing with the British fourth army, have
been withdrawn with only approxi
mately 11,500 officers and men in
each, does not seem that these or
ganizations have been reduced to less
than half of their normal strength in
the severe fighting on the British
front before the signing of the armis
tice. Army officers recalled today that
only the infantry and machine gun
units of these divisions went into ac
tion with the British forces, the ar
tillery being used elsewhere. It also
was regarded as more than probable
that the infarttry and machine gun
units were reduced in number so as to
make the division conform in size to
the British with which they were
operating.
The British divisional unit numbers
about 12,500 men. The 27th division
is the New York National guard di
vision commanded by Ma. Gen. John
F. O'Ryan, the only National guard
officer to have served through the
war with that high rank. The 30th
division was composed of the Tennes
see, North Carolina and South Caro
lina National guard and was known
as the '"Wildcat" division.
Both these organizations say heavy
action with the British and were high
ly commended by British officers
for their desperate fighting when
Marshal Haig's armies were smashing
the Hindenburg line in northern
France early in the fall and later en
gagements. Their losses undoubtedly
have been heavy, but it is not regard
ed as probable-that half their original
strength figured in the casualty lists.
So far as known here no date for
the return of these or any other di
visions from France has been fixed.
Secretary Baker said today none of
the divisional organizations would ar
rive home before Christmas as the
transport facilities will bo used in
moving casuals and sick and wound
ed. When the divisions do return from
France they will bear little resemb
lance in enlisted personnel to the
same divisions when they started
overseas. Application of the one army
theory to all the forces and the sys
tems of replacement employed to fill
gaps in front line organizations will
be found to have obliterated to a
large degree the lines which before
their departure divided the divisions
into national guard, national army or
regular organizations.
This fact was sharply illustrated to
day by news from France that the
76th division had reached its embarka
tion port on the other side with a full

Apology Made by Peruvian
Government and Chile Re
calls Its Consul Who Made
Inflammatory Reports
Hj- Review leased Wire)
NEW YORK. Nov. 26. Difficulties
between Peru and Chile, which result
ed yesterday in recall of consular rep
resentatives by each nation from the
principal cities of its neighbor, have
been overcome by an apology on the
part of the Peruvian government,
Carlos Castro Ruiz, consul general of
Chile announced here tonight.
A cablegram informing him of the
Peruvian apology was received to
night by Mr. Ruiz, according to his
statement from the Chilean minister
of foreign affairs.
The message, the consul asserted,
authorized him to announce that the
Peruvian officials admitted -that in
making reports of outbreaks against
their citizens in Inquique and Antofa
gasta, Chile, they had acted on mis
information. This was furnished, he
said, by the Peruvian consul at Iqui
que, whose authority had been can
celled for this reason by the Chilean
government.
The apology sent from Lima, Mr.
Ruiz added, was wholly satisfactory
to the Chilean officials and "brought
the misunderstanding to an end."
The consul general stated a series
of messages received from Santiago
today denied reports of anti-Peruvian
demonstrations in Chile. The cable
grams further announced, the dis
missal of the Peruvian envoy in Iqui
que "had provoked in Peru a certain
agitation that influenced my govern
ment to withdraw its consuls."
Despite a border dispute between
the two countries, Mr. Ruiz declared,
Chile had "the utmost sympathy for
Peru and had taken steps to watch the
irontier so as to prevent Peruvian rev
olutionists from receiving arms or am
munition from compatriots. residing in
Chile." His government, he add, had
taken active measures to assist Peru
in maintaining a stable government.

Statement Issued From Wash

Same Terms in Cash
(By Review Leased Wife)
WASHINGTON, ' Nov.
2Sv-The
United States government -has re
fused to approve the proposed
transfer to a British syndicate of
the vessels now under British veg
istry owued by the International
Mercantile Marine corporation.
Bainbridge Colby of the shipping
board, in making this announce
ment tonight, said the government
had offered to take over the owner
ship of these vessels upon the
tetms of the British offer.
The vessels concerned in the British
syndicate's offer number approximate
ly 85 of an aggregate tonnage of 730,
000 gross tons. They include some of
the most important now. engaged in
the trans-Atlantic service, such as the
Olympic and many others of familiar
names.
This formal statement was issued at
the office of the shipping board:
"Announcement was made at the
shipping board that the International
Mercantile Marine corporation had to
day been advised of the government's
disinclination to give its approval to
the proposed transfer to a British syn
dicate of the American ownership
which has for years been vested in
the International Mercantile Marine
corporation of the latter's vessels now
under British registry.
"Bainbridge Colby of the shipping
board, stated an offer by a British
syndicate to acquire from the Interna
tional Mercantile Marine corporation,
the tonnage in question had been un
der consideration for some time. The
offer was expressly conditioned upon
its approval by both the Lnited States
and British governments. The nego
tiations, he stated, had been carried
on by the International corporation
with entire frankness, so far as the
government is concerned, and the de
cision now reached is due to the re
luctance felt that an ownership which
has so long been held in this country,
covering so important a tonnage,
should at this time, and under the
conditions now prevailing in shipping
throughout the world, be suffered to
pass out of American hands.
"The vessels immediately concerned
in the syndicate's offer are approxi
mately 85 in number and aggregate
730,000 gross tons, or, in their dead-
I weight equivalent, about 1,000,000
tons. They include some of the most
important vessels now engaged in
trans-Atlantic service, such as the
Olympic and many other vessels of
large type and familiar names.
"The government has announced its
willingness to take over the owner
ship of these vessels upon the terms
! of the British offer, whirh is consid-
j ered a fair price for tonnage of this
l exceptional character.
j "Notification has bepn sent to the
International Mercantile Marine cor
poration of the government's de
cision." Negotiations for the sale of the
'. ships have been under way for some
weeks anda few days ago the ship
ping board requested the International
Mercantile Marine corporation to take
no further steps looking to consum
! mation of the deal until the govern
ment could reach a decision.

Conference
(By Review Leased Wire)
PARIS. Nov. 26. (By the Associat

gates and their staffs of specialists
arrive in Paris for the peace congress
they will find a complete chancellery
organized for them. This Is being
arranged under the direction of
Joseph C. Grew, former counselor of
the American embassy in Vienna, who
came to France with Colonel House,
but who now is specially concerned
with preparing for the American dele
gation. Divisions of international law,
geography, economics, personnel and
intelligence already have been organ
ized and when the staffs arrive every
man will have his place in divisions
ready to function. ' '
The divisions of international law
and of geography probably will be
the most important branches in bear
ing directly on the work of the peace
congress. The geography section will
be concerned with the boundaries of
new Europe. For this purpose it has
assembled an exceptionally complete
collection of maps showing all stages
of development and change In the
various counties affected by the war.
The international law section em
braces legal advisers who have as
sembled much material on all inter
national questions which will be
placed before the congress. The in
telligence section deals especially
with present conditions in the various
countries.
Much of this preparatory work has
been done by an executive commit
tee under Colonel House.
The initial work of this committee
was done with a large force of ex
perts at the American Geographical
society in New York, but the results
are taking practical form in the

IN EARLY DAYS OF ITS GATH

TWO VIEWPOINTS SEEN
IDEALS SHOULD COME BEFORE
TERRITORIAL ASPIRATIONS IN
SITTING; CHIEF AMONG THESE
IS TO PREVENT FURTHER CON
FLICT BY LEAGUE
(t!y Review Leaned Wire)
PARIS. Nov. 26, (By the Associated
Press.) A league of nations is likely
to figure before the peace conference
at an early stage of the proceedings,
instead of being relegated to the close,
after the territorial aspirations of the
various powers are settled.
Two distinct viewpoints have devel
oped on this subject. The American
view is that the coming congress will
not be like the Vienna congress
which devoted itself principally to ar
ranging what each power should re
ceive as a result of the Napoleonic up
heaval. According to the American
view the present war was based on
certain high ideals and was not a
struggle for territorial gains. There
fore, iu is maintained, ideals should
come before territorial aspirations in
the deliberations of the congress, and
these ideals having been defined
should thereafter be the main guide in
national aspirations. One of the chief
of these ideals, it is pointed out, was
to, prevent future warfare.i and a
league of nations has been generally
and officially accepted as the most
practical organization for accomplish
ing that ideal. It is therefore held
that this should be one of the first
subjects considered and should set a
standard of ideals for other subjects
following.
It can be stated this American view
of procedure has found warm sup
porters In England and France though
there is also another viewpoint which
clings to the old procedure under the
Vienna congress, whereby indiviiiuil
aspirations for territory have first
consideration.
Those urging that territorial ques
tions should come first say it is high
ly desirable to sign a peace treaty
embodying the essential details - at
the earliest possible moment as to
terminate the official war period un
der whichtroops are held for the dura
tion of the war and railroads, tele
graphs and other public utilities are
similarly affected until peace Is de
clared. According to this view an
early peace agreement on essentials
would release the armies, including
the American troops holding the oc
cupied regions.
Having secured an early agreement
on territorial and other practical de
tails it is suggested the larger gen
eral questions, like a league of na
tions, could come up later for extend
ed discussion either by the peace con
gress or a separate international con
gress to formulate the working details
of the league. This view is chiefly
held by those favoring the old Vienna
congress procedure of individual
claims first, while the American view
point is distinctly favorable to es-

NEW YORK, Nov. 26. George
W. Wickersham, attorney general
in the Taft administration, in an
address tonight before educators,
lawyers, bankers and mediants
engaged in international trade
who are members cf the council
on foreign relations, advanced
the opinion that the constitution
makes it mandatory upon Vice
President Marshall to assume the
office of president it Mr. Wilson
leaves the United States to attend
the pe?ce conference.
The former attorney general quoted
Section 1 of Article 2 of the United
States constitution whi'h, he said,
prescribed the made of procedure in
event of the president "removal lroni
olfice. his dealh. resignation or in
ability to discharge the duties cf said
office." He maintained that ab.-ence
of the president irom the seat of
government and the country 'consti
tutes an inability to disc!! arte the
pewers and dulies of his office" with
in the meaning of the law.
According to Mr. Wickersham. the
two main fun'tions the president has
lo perform i.i connection wiih a ses
sion of coneress, pi which time he
held "it is the piesident's duty to be
at the sent of icovernnient." are:
"First, from time to time -lo Khe to
congress information as to the stace
of country and recommend to their
atteii'ion such matters as he shall
consider necessary.' and. second, 'to
consider bills which .-hall have passed
the house and somite and" if he ap
proves, to Hsu them and if he disap
proves to veto them." "
The ten days provide! lv Ihe law
wherein the president must return a
biil or it automatically becomes law,
according to Mr. Wicker-ham, was
intended "to uive citizens interested
in ihe bill an opijortuiiity of com
niunicatins their views to him.' Thus,
the president, he contended, is ex
pected always to bo in a position to
feel tiie pulse of public sentiment,"
ar.d "if he is not within the country
he cannot litly discharge those
duties."
A thirl consideration, the sneaker
continued, "subsidiary to the others.!
tut none the; less important," is the i
reference to the exerc ise by the prrs-'
idem of a function in on!ic-tinn with!
legislature. In c ase of disagreement :

"That these questions in the past
never have arisen for actual decision
is a tribute to the wisdom of our
presidents in conforming with the
traditions of their great office, with
rhat unbroken custom wh!i h ripens
into law, and in not suffering the
whisperings of personal ambition to
lead them to depart from the paths
of accustomed action, thereby avoid

CONSTANTINOPLE, Saturday. Nov.
23. The proposed independent states

"The Turks are a proud race and
would resent such control, but it is
inevitable. For myself, I prefer
America.

strive to enforce these principles in
Turkey.
"Regarding the Turks, many say,
with Mr. Asquith (former premier of
Great Britain), that the Turks are
ended in Europe. They must mean
the Turkish government, because I
suppose nobody has advocated driv
ing the Constantinople Turks from
their homes.
"That a substitute for the present
government would solve the problem
is a question. Even if an interna

where it is surely doubtful if it could
succeed in Constantinople where racial

MEETING IN GOTHAM; WOMEN

(Ly Review Le:tse-1 Wk-e)
NEW YORK. Nov. 2ri To rrevent
a recurrence of the clash between
socialists and soldiers and sailors
which followed the meeting in Madi
son Square Garden last night, police
reserves were hurried tonight to a
hall in East .'-"itty-eiahth street in
which Internationalists had gathered
to denounce capitalism.
Several hundred men in uniform
gathered outside the hall. They
roughly handled one young woman
wearing a miniature red flag in her
hair while taking it from her. After
t!:e meeting started the soldiers and
sailors demanded entrance, but were
held back by the police. Representa
tives who entered the hall singly came
back and assured the men outside
that the red flag was not being dis
played and that no disloyal utterances
had been made.
There was but one disturbance in
the hall during the meeting. This
was when a soldier and several civil
ians removed a red necktie from a
man standing at the rear.
The police lined the streets for a
block in bolh directions to protect
the internationalists when the meet
ing. ended. Women with red flowers
or red ribbons on their hats were
addressed roughly by the uniformed
men, who demanded the offering color
be removed. No attacks were made
on women, but several men were
chased by sailors and- a few were
beaten.

THE TYRANNY OF MAJORITIES
Peace hath her problems, no less than
war, and in every nation on earth today
these peace problems loom to the front.
With the fall of the extreme of autocracy
rises the menace of the extreme of democ
racy. In Europe- this danger is real. The
bolshevik over there have enslaved Rus
sia and are rampant in Austria and Ger
many. In free America they have appeared
and broken out, only to be sternly sup
pressed by law and frowned upon by the
general public. Nevertheless, eternal vigi
lance must be maintained against them.
They are despicable, but not to be de
spised. Governor Lowden of Illinois, in a
speech in Chicago the other day, spoke
significantly and upon matters of vast im
portance when he said:
"A free people can never content itself
with just celebrating a victory. Eternal
vigilance is still the price of liberty. The
average man has a responsibility which he
never bore before. The future of the world
is in his keeping. He, not kings, must de
cide what the morrow shall be. He can
make it, as the men of America have made
it fcr our own land, a day of joy and op
portunity for all; or he can make it a hide
ous nightmare, as the bolshevik have made
it in Russia, wherein men, women and
children long for the return of kings.
"It is. often said that ours is a govern
ment by the majority. It is that, but it is
something more. Our fathers thought
that there were some rights so sacred that
even a majority should not suspend those
rights. Among them wa3 religious free
dom. It was provided that even the ma
jority could not take from the individual
his life, his liberty, or his property except
by due process of law.
"It is thus seen that ours is a government
of liberty and justice, and not merely a
government by the majority. It is true
that the majority administers the govern
ment, but the moment that majority de
parts from the principles of liberty and
justice, that moment the majority threat
ens the very foundations of our govern
ment. "In the view of the fathers, despotism
was equally hateful, whether the despot
ism of kings or the despotism of the ma
jority. We have just endured the horrors
and the sacrifices of the greatest war the
world has ever known to rid humanity of
the tyranny of kings ; and now civilization
is threatened with that other tyranny, the
tyranny of the mob. It doesn't matter in
the least to civilization by what right the
tryant claims to rule, whether, as in the
case of a Hohenzollern, by divine right, or
a3 in the case of Lenine and Trotzky, by
self-appointment. The results to human
ity are precisely the same in either case.
"Arduous indeed have been the last two
years, but equally arduous are the years be
fore us, if we preserve the fruits of our
heroes' victories. We have seen the fall of
great and powerful nations, because they
denied the supremacy of the moral law;
because they had dethroned justice; be
cause they had pinned their faith to might,
not right. And if the nations of the earth
have not learned in the awful sacrifices of
the last four years that 'Righteousness ex
alteth a nation, but sin is a reproach to any
people,' these sacrifices have been in vain."
THE CABLE SEIZURE
(Chicago Tribune.)
The armistice virtually ended the neces
sities of military censorship. The surrender
of the German fleet is the complete act of
German surrender. The allied forces soon
will be on the Rhine and in control of the
gate fortresses to Germany. Military
censorship of news, consequently, loses its
reason for being.
All during the time when military oper
ations were being conducted and when
there was necessity for censorship, the
cables were free. Such news as might be
sent was carried by them without govern
ment intervention in the method.
Now that fighting has ceased and that
international and national politics present
the gravest question our government seizes
the cables. George Creel goes to Europe.
Burleson takes charge of the system of
transmission of news and opinion, and if
congress yields to amazement it is small
wonder.
If the cable systems were inefficiently
managed why did it take the government
all the time of the war to discover the fact ?
Why was it necessary to wait until fight
ing had ceased and international politic
had begun? Why did the necessity arise
five days after the armistice went into ef
fect ? Why did it arise at the moment
President Wilson made known his inten
tion of going to Europe?
Congressmen would be extraordinarily
credulous if they accepted the stated gov
ernment reasons for the assumption of con
trol of the cables at th time. They are
justified in the suspicion that an amazing
attempt to influence American opinion has
proceeded to the extent of seizing the
mechanism by which information, upon
which opinion is based, is transmitted.
George Creel's record in dealing with
news and with the public is one of aston
ishing partisian enthusiasm. He says he
does not intend to censor the news that
this is not his task. He does not have to
censor. With Burleson holding the lines
and Creel, with his staff of assistants stuff
ing them, censorship would be a superac
' tivity.
Intelligent men in congress fear this
new and strange government act, and just
ly, because they fear that President Wilson,
going abroad, will be able to override all
congressional restraints, reduce congress to
a condition of total inutility, and thus be
come virtual dictator of the fate and fu
ture of the American nation, possibly com
mit it to policies with which congress would
not agree if it were not first made help
less.
Every circumstance of the taking over
of the cables at this time give3 substance to
the fear that a manipulation of American
opinion will be undertaken and that by the
manipulation of opinion the coercion of
congress will be made not only possible but
easy.
The political danger of such an under
taking is apparent.
THE KEYS OF METZ
(Christian Science Monitor)
The keys of Metz, saved in 1 870 by the
engineer Dietz, were recently handed to
M. Clemenceau, in view of the expected
fall of the fortress and its return to France.
Each of the keys has this peculiarity, that
each carry an ace engraved; the ace of
clubs, the ace of hearts, and the ace of
spades. The key with the ace of hearts
bears also the letter S, showing it to be
long to the Porte Serpennoise; the ace of
clubs carried the letter P, for the Porte de
Paris, the ace of spades the letter D, for the
Porte Diedenhofen, or Thionville. M.
Clemenceau intends that the keys shall be
handed back to the Metz municipality.
Meanwhile he has deposited them for safe
keeping at the Ministere de la Guerre.
WHEN A MAN DIES
Dinsmore Ely, Chicago aviator, was kill
ed in France last spring. His last letter to
his parents, dated Paris, . April 3, closed
thus:
"And I want to say, in closing, if any
thing should happen to me, let's have no
mourning, in spirit or in dress. Like a
Liberty bond, it is an investment, not a loss,
when a man dies for his country. It is an
honor to a family, and is that the time for
weeping? I would rather leave my family
rich in pleasant memories of my fife than
numbed in sorrow at my death."
CLEMENCEAU AND THE FOURTEEN
POINTS
(Manchester Guardian)
This is given me as the truth of what M.
Clemenceau said when the draft of Presi
dent Wilson's original note with the four
teen points was handed to him. He said:
"Quatorze points! Mais cela c'est un peu
fort le bon Dieu n'en avait que dix."
(Fourteen points; That is going pretty
strong the good Lord only had ten.)
In the recent election the ' republiacns
have quite materially increased their
strength in the legislature. The downfall
of the Hunt machine came none too early,
as Huntism in Arizona has been steadily
grinding away the democratic majority in
the state.

UNUSUAL DEMONSTRATION OF

BRUSSELS, Sunday, Nor. 24 (By

famous church of Salnte Gudule, dur
ing a service of thanksgiving for Bel

The old church was crowded, and
the royal family, members of the cab
inet and the diplomatic corps were
present. The service was the most
impressive and beautiful ever seen in
Brussels, most of the gerat congre
gation being moved to tears.
At the conclusion of the te deum,
a band which had been especially pro
vided, started to play the Belgium na
tional anthem. But their over
wrought emotions quickly carried
them to cheering, which was probably
the first time in history such a thing
occurred there.
The king and queen and Cardinal
Mercier were all acclaimed In mighty
volume. Then came the ringing cry
"vive L' Amerique!" and a moment
later, as Minister Whitlock passed
down the aisle the audience broke

The secretary of state added that
the hostility of the Czechs and Hun

reports that efforts would be made by
the Czechs even to take part of German-speaking

Dr. Bauer continued, that the peace
conference must aid in the settling of
the difficulties of the new republics
and lead them toward prosperity. He
said he and other members of the

FOOD HOLDS OUT
VIENNA, Thursday, Nov. 21. (By
the Associated Press.) The fcod sit
uation is still a general topic of con
versation. It it evident there is
plenty of food in the hotels and res
taurants for those persons who are
able to pay the equivalent of from two
to five dollars for each meal. The
poor have been unable to obtain rice
or macaroni. That this class of the
population is still alive' is due simply
to their endurance.
According to Dr. Welter Otis, an
American, food conditions were never
as bad as now, bcth in Vienna and
the country districts. On the farms
there still are a certain number of
hogs which are being fattened with
milk. This milk. Dr. Otis said, was
really needed for the sick, but the
farmers earned more money by feed
ing it to their hogs. He added the
milk supply would cease as soon as
the coldest weather sets in in the mid
dle of December.
John Arthur Weiss, another Amer
ican, says there is possibly enough
fcod for another two months.
Speculation in food during the war
has been one ot the chief causes of
the poor suffering. It is sad that

BY REVIEW
NLW YORK, Nov. 26. Disreard
' a.uh widely divergent elements as
j easier money and reports of adili
! tibial withdrawals of war contracts.
toiiay's stock market speedily recov
ered from its heavy opening, record
ing many material advances over the
previous session's general declines.
Sii-'ns of an eany relaxation of
money were afforded by the further
appearance of time funds from in
terior banks with offers of Rix and
seven months' loans at 6 per cent.
Call loans were freely offered at 5
per cent on mixed collateral. Trad
ers seemed to view the railroad sit
uation as precipitated by Secretary
McAdoo's coming retirement with less
misgivings and confident accumula
tion of high class transportations re
sulted at extreme advances of 1 to
3 points.
Shippings also scored material ral
lies. Mercantile Marine preferred ad
vancing almost 5 points, despite an
nouncement of another halt In the
deal by order of Washington, allied
shares gaining 2 to almost 3 points.
Most of the steels and equipments
reeistered substantial upward prog
ress with coppers, the latter issues
ignoring rumors of further pilce cut
ting. Sales amounted to 650.000
shares.
The one adverse feature was the
bond market, where quotations shaded
generally on further pressure against
Liberty issues, the fourth 4 Us making
another new low record at $97.08.
Total sales, par value, aggregated $13,
675.000. Old United Slates bonds
were unchanged on call.
METAL MARKET.
NEW YORK, Nov. 26. Lead Un
changed. Spelter Steady. Spot, East St.
Louis delivery offered at J8.50.
GRAIN MARKET.
CHICAGO, Nov; 26. Anxiety ,.f
shorts that new restrictions on trad
ing were contemplated brought sharp
bulges today In the corn market.
Prices closed strong; 3!s to 5 net
higher, with December 1.258 nd
January 1.26 to 1.26V4- Oats gained
1 to 1 and provisions finished un
changed to 50 cents up.
Uneasiness on the part of shorts
in corn resulted chiefly from semi
official investigation of the question
whether short selling of corn might
not advantageously be banned as
already the case with cotton. Scru
tiny on this line was construed in
some quarters as a threat of drastic
measures asainst speculative shorts.
A series of flurries to cover resulted,
and although sharp reactions inter
vened, the market closed at virtually
the top level of the day.
Oats were firmer with corn. Rural
offerings to arrive were iikht, and re
ceipts smaller than generally had
been looked for.
Provisions averaged higher owing
to the upturns in corn.
COTTON MARKET.
NEW YORK, Nov. 26 Early ad
vances in cotton were followed by
sharp recessions under liquidation
and scattered Southern selling. Jan-

The storm of the past few days will
be of a very material benefit to the
various roads in the county that are
under construction and also the old
roads. County Engineer Barker has
been at work on nearly all of the roads
of the county out with drags and
scrapers putting the roads in good
shape. A few. days' sunshine will
give the county some excellent roads.
AGENT AT WARREN.
As a matter of convenience to the
residents at Warren, the El Paso &

purchase tickets and check their bag
gage out of Warren station, instead
of having to go to Lowell or Bisbee

ALL IN.
All whisky at the city jail is now
out of the bottles and in real old
fashioned whisky barrels, such as one
saw in days of long ago. There is sup
posed to be $S00.00O worth of it and
the transfer of the material has been
a big job. The corridor of the city
hall is lined with the filled barrels
today and looks like a section of s
Kentucky distillery. The red eye will
be shipped to Phoenix for the. gov
ernment. However, tbf aroma will
remain for some days to come and old
timers with a longing heart will be
welcome to come around to get a
sniff. Douglas International.

PREPARATIONS BEING
MADE FOR CHANGE IN
COUNTYJFFICES
GEORGE HENSHAW OF WILLCOX,
IS TO BE CHIEF DEPUTY UNDER
SHERIFF JAS. M'DONALD; TWO
WARREN DISTRICT APPLICANTS
AFTER BOARD CLERK POSITION
Preparations are being made in
Tombstone for the change in admin
istration in some of the county offices
that is to take place on the first of
January- Commencing at the door of
the court house, as you go in to the
treasurer's office. This is at present
occupied by Treasurer Harry S. Ross
and his assistants. A change will
be made here. Mr. Ross the present
ecunty treasurer will leave fcr Phoe
nix, to assume his duties as state
treasurer, having been elected to that
position at the recent election. It is
understood that he will take some of
the help that he now has in the
1 office with him to that city. His for
mer deputy. Vaughn Wood, is now in
Phoenix, acting as secretary of the
state tax commission. The position
of county treasurer will be filled for
the next two years by Guy C. Welch,
who is present sheriff of the county.
He has been filling that position since
the resignation of Sheriff Wheeler,
when the latter went to France. He
had been filling the position as under
sheriff or chief deputy since Mr.
Wheeler was elected, seven years ago.
Mr. Welch has not made any an
nouncement as to who will be his as
sistant in that office.
The supervisors come next. Two
members have been elected, I. C. E.
Adams of Lowell, who will hold of
fice for four years, being the hold
over by reason of the fact that he
received the highest vote at the re-
cert election and Chas M. Roberts of
WillrnT whom, if ir understood, will
make his home in Tombstone. The
T '
other member of the board will be
J. M. Sparks of Douglas, who is the
holdover. The retiring members are
Vance M. Johnson of this city "and
John Rock, of Tombstone. When the
board is organized it will elect a chair
man from its members. This dis
posed of. the matter of the selection
cf a clerk will be made. So far there
have been two names mentioned for
the position, Oscar Doyle, of Lowell,
and Charles Mahan of this city. Oscar
Doyle was at one time acting deputy
clerk of the board and has some ex
perience with the work. He is a dis
tant relative of I. C. E. Adams, while
Charles Mahan is a son-in-law of Mr.
Adams. A peculiar circumstance
comes with this situation. While Mr
Doyle was acting as assistant clerk.
,as he was a member of the state
legislature. The law provides tnat no
member of the legislature shall hold
an elective or appointive office in the
state while he is a member of that
body. This question was raised by
State Senator Roberts, now supervisor
elect and as a consequence Doyle was
compelled to resign as was William
Graham, who was acting as a dep
uty . sheriff at Lowell under Sheriff
Wheeler and John Merrill, who was
acting as a court baliff. Roberts will
now have a chance to place Doyle
back in the office. A. C. Karger will
be the retiring clerk, and he has
f.he reputation throughout the state
of being the most efficient clerk of
any of the boards of supervisors. He
has hosts of friends throughout the
county, who will miss him from the
office of the board. Mr. Karger stated
yesterday that he had mode no defi
nite plans for the future, but expected
to continue to make Cochise county
his home. His able assistant, E. C.
Porter, will engage in some sort of
business in the county.
At the end of the hall comes the
recorder's office, there will be no
change here, as Mr. Krebs was re
elected to fill the same office, and
will no doubt keep his same force of
competent deputies. His record in
the office is one of courtesy and ef
ficiency. ' Sh-rifTf. Office
Next comes the sheriffs office and
jail. Sheriff Guy C. Welch will re
linquish the title and that office to
James F. McDonald of this city, the
former deputy marshall. Mr. McDon
ald has not yet made the official an
nouncement as to who will be his dep
uties stationed at the different ports
of the county. He has selected as
chief deputy or under sheriff, George
Henshaw of Willcox. Mr. Henshaw
has been a resident of the county for
a number of years. He was at one
time in business in this city and
then moved to the northern part of
the county. For the past few years
he has been connected with the Nor
ton & Morgan Commercial company
at Willcox, until a few months ago,
he went into the insurance business.
Mr. Henshaw has been in Tombstone
for several days making arrangements

No Other Changes
In the other offices upstairs in the
courthouse there will be no changes.
County Assessor Edwin Hughes was
re-elected to his office by the high
vote on the ticket. J. E. James was
re-elected to fill the office of clerk
of the superior court, with the next
to the highest vote. He has filled
the position capably for two terms
and his conduct of the office and the
care of the records is well known to
the citizens of the county.
In the superior court Judge A. C.
Lockwood will continue to mete out
justice, as he has been doing for the
past six years.
Across the street from the court
house will be found the office of the
county superintendent of schools and
to the credit of the voters and tax
payers of the county, there will be
no change in this effice as Miss Toles
was the only Republican elected to
an office on the state and county tick-
et in this county. She and her as
I .
sistant. Miss Helen Benedict, will con
tinue to supervise the schools of the
county and the record of the office
needs no recommendation here.
YAVAPAI COUNTY
REACHES QUOTA IN
WAR SAVING STAMPS
THAT IS ONLY SECTION OF STATE
WHICH HAS GAINED DESIRED
TOTAL, HOWEVER, COCONINO
SECOND BEST WITH COCHISE
STANDINGS FIFTH IN LIST
PHOENIX, Ariz.. Nov. 26. Yavapai
county is the only" county in the state
which has reached quota for the war
savings stamps. For the whole 12
months the amount per capita which
should be raised is $20, so for the
first 11 months the amount per person
in each county which should ha,ve
been invested in thrift stamps is
$18.18 and no county but Yavapai has
been able to report such progress.
Yavapai has done even better than
keep pace with its monthly quota,
for n ithat banneT county the entire
$20 per capita is already invested in
war savings stamps witha balance
of 84 cents to the good.
Coconino is the second best county
In the state with respect to the pur
chase of thrift stamps. Coconino has
averaged 115.15 per person and so is
about 3 per head behind the courrty
quota. Greenlee is the third county
in standing in the state and Maricopa
is the fourth. Then follows Gila,
which is almost tied with Maricopa,
Pinal, Cochise. Mohave, Yuma, Pima,
Santa Cruz, Graham, Navajo and
Apache.
The whole state has about two mil
lions and a quarter still to invest in
war savings stamps during the bal
ance of the year in order to meet the
expectations of the government offi
cials. The fact that some of the most
largely populated counties in the
state have maintained a higher aver
age than some of the more lesser pop
ulated ones alone has made possible
as good a showing as is made. All
these figures are up to November 1.
If Arizona fails to make quota for
the thrift stamps it will be the first
patriotic movement in which it has
not met requirements and all sections
are getting busy, according to reports
at state headquarters, to avert this
catastrophe. Cochise, in particular, is
making a great rally to meet its quota
with special drives participated in by
the leading citizens of Douglas.
