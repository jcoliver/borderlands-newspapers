The fight was between three Ameri

Two German machines also went to

Once . a lieutenant answered an
alarm fcr cne enemy machine which
was reported to be flying low. When
he approached the enemy, five addi

been "sitting" up obive, dropped down
from the clouds and attacked .the
American plane which was driven by
Lieutenant Cunningham, who despite
odds put up a desperate fight. One of
the German machines ran home after
emptying: its machine gun. The Amer
ican kept up the fight and then the
machine gun on the airplane piloted
by Lieutenant Cunnigham jammed ad
he was forced to withdraw. The Ger
mans did not follow him but took to
flight.
Cunningham returned with ten bul
let holes in his plane.
Later in the day, in response to an
alarm that thre German machines

kilometer inside the American front,
three Americans went out. They weii
out to open the attack when four ad

eGrman side of the line.
Cy noon there had -been several ex
amples of this new German trick, and
Americans answering later alarms
went out in twice the number of Ger

In the house of commons since the

do not give him time for constant at

this afternoon that the cabinet had de
cided to entrust to a commission of
two judges the investigation of the
charges which General Frederick B.
Maurice, former chief director of mili

fice made, that the cabinet had de
ceived th" country in parliament about
the army in France.
Of all the remarkable and unexpect

none surpasses th-3 situation precipi

generals of the army. Genera Maur

This was a direct challenge to all
roles of military discipline and tech

"a very prave step." and Indicated his
willingness to suffer the consequences.

for the forced deportations, violated
federal laws forbidding conspiracy to
deprive citizens of their constitutional
rights. The penalty provided by law Is
a fine of not more than $5,000 and im
prisonment for not more than tan
years.
The department of justice has been
investigating the deportations since

BY REVIEW LEASED WIRE.
NEW YORK, May 7. Industrials
dominated today's active stock market
almost to the exclusion of all. other
issues. Enthusiasm engenered by
the outcome of the Liberty campaign
was again the paramount influence.
Vnited States Steel pot into Its stride
at the start and before the end of
the session recorded an extreme ad
vance of 2 points to 1034 on sales
or about 300,000 scares.
Kindred industrials, like Bethlehem
Steel "A and "B" were 2 to 3Vi
Eisner following declaration of the
regular dividends.
Copper awakened from their long
torpor at pains of 1 to 2 points, oils
advancing 2 to 5 points, and motors
and sundry specialties were 1 to 3
points higher.
Ralls were scarcely more than
steady until the final hour, when Read
ing an dother coalers, together with
Vnion and Southern Pacific, were
rushed forward at net advances of 1
to 14 points. Sals amounted to
920,000 shares.
Call money lacked the ease which
was expected to result from the end
of the Liberty drive, most loans being
made at 5 to 6 per cent
Bonds were firm, (except Liberty
Issues, which displayed slight Irreg
ularity. Sales par -value aggregated
$4,925,000. United States Bonds, old
issues, were unchanged on call.
GRAINS
CHICAGO, May 7. Excellent field
conditions tended today to put corn
prices on the down grade. .As a re
sult the market closed unsettled at
the same as yesterday's finish to 1
cents lower with May 1.27 and July
1.46 to 1.4SV. Oats declined to
14 cents net. In provisions the out
come ranged from a setback of 12 to
5 cents advance.
Breaks in the value of corn began
at the opening of business and despite
numerous small rallies, continued to
recur throughout the session.
Oats gave way with corn ana as a ;
result of the bearish crop outlook.
Provisions averaged tower n conse
quence of the grain weakness.

C.&A. Will Play
Queen Nine Today
Full of confidence as a result of
their Carrison finish which gave them
a ten-fnning victory over the Junction
Mriggs team .Sunday the C. & A. ball
club, piloted by Manager Youngman,
will tackle the Copper Queen nine
this afternoon at Warren Park.. Hos
tilities open at 5:30 sharp.
The C. & A. boys have been prac
ticing faithfully for the clash and if
preparing will give them victory they
i will finish on top, for these youngsters
' are out every afternoon on their own
time keeping in shape.
Johnson or Curley will probably
start on the slab. Johnson pitched a
great game in the league opener but
'since has been troubled with a sore
' ?rm and has not done any slab work.
! Curley has nitched good ball in each
start to date. In addition to this duo
the C. & A. have Snhellenbarger, for
mer Pomona college chueker. The
latter has a world of stulT in practice
and good control but has difficulty lo
cating the plate In a game.
Bidwell Goud Hurler
Hasty Bidwell, Los Angeles semi
pro, will be seen in the outfield today
although he is rated by many who
have seen him work as one of the best
hurlers that has appeared in uniform
this season in Blsbee. Bidwell doe
not care to pitch and when one con
siders the ragged support that has
generally been accorded flinger3 cn
the C. & A. team and the condition of
the grounds which scuffs up a base-
' ball and makes it hard to throw it may
be that Bidwell Is using good jud;?-
. ment in resigning from slab dutj
Manager Youngman will change hir.
infield around for the game and in all
probability will play second base with

"Honestly, I've been trying for
twelve years to get the relief three
bottles of fiis Tanlac has given me,"
Uleclares J. L. Flockenstein, a well
known city emplove of Denver. Col
orado, living at 1232 Olive street, re
cently.
"Yes. twelve years ago." he contin
ued. "I was tolil I had appendicitis
and they wanted to operate on me. I
kept taking medicine. thinking I
would get over my trouble but 1 just

no good and I had an awful burning
and pains in and about my stomach.

medicine because nothing Iielppd me.
I was blue and despondent, had no
ambition and was just getting clean
down and out.
"I was so miserable I just felt like
I must get some relief, somehow, and
when I saw so mur.h in the papers
about Tanlac I decided to see if it
would do me any good. Well. It's
fine. My awful pain and distress
went away with my second bottle. ;
My appetite is good now; I eat hearty
and sleeo like a log. I may have
gained some in weight, too, I don't
know about that, but I do know I feel
like a new man. and Tanlac is the
cause of it. If anyone will inquire I
certainly will tell them what this
medicine will do. I'm satisfied there's
nothing eoual to it."
Tanlac is sold In Bisbee by J. M
Ball, in Douglas by Douglas Drug Co..
in Paradise by G. A Walker, in Bowie
by Bowie Drug Store, In San Simon

Morris on first. Brown will operate
at short and Janssen at third. The lat
ter Is t. better hot corner guardian
than shortfielder, while Brown looks
like real class at short. He is also a
sweet hitter and has a great army
while he covers considerable acreage
on the inner defense.
KincPid, Gait and Bidwell will car"
for the gardens while Meachem is
delegated to handle the piicher's
shoots behind he rubber. Noona-i
will perform as utility man.

The Oueen team will probably pitch
Campbell, a wet delivery flinger who
has a spitter that breaks a fcot when
it is going right. Manager Fred Carries
has a "lot of confidence In this hurler
and will probably give him a chance
to show, although he may switch to
Ferd Hanson at the last minute. Han
son bfted tho C. & A. in easy fashion
in their first meeting.
Dcke I.ebrandt will catch, with
Hesse at first, Carnes on second r.n 1
Krii'baum at short, and Jake Wilson,
third. Stadelii, Bob Whaling and
either one of the right handed pitchers
or Tonneson will make up the out
field. . Carnes is after two or three more
men. and when these land, does not
believe the other teams will have a
chance to beat his club.

Sidney Osborne, secretary of state, in
announcing the declaration of principles
of his candidacy for the Democratic nom
ination in a letter to a Warren district
friend the other day, followed the lead of
Tom Campbell, Republican candidate, and
adopted a win the war platform as the car
dinal principal of his campaign. His an
nouncement was brimming with loyal and
patriotic terms. He also took a decided
stand against the I. W. W. Mr. Osborne
has been called a Hunt candidate, and, in
deed, his record is that of a Hunt man, but
many of his friends deny that he seeks the
gubernatorial nomination as a Hunt man.
Certain it is that Osborne, in his announce
ment, did not make any strong bid for the
support of the more radical of the Hunt
followers in the state. He denounced the
I. W. V. agitators in plain terms and like
Tom Campbell, in his great and patriotic
declaration, placed the winning of the war
before all faction, class, differences and
fued. Loyalty and earnest, unfailing effort
to leave nothing undone to (promote the
government war program should be the
great principle and prominent plank in
every party and candidate's platform. It is '
about time other gubernatorial candidates
were coming out plainly and squarely and
fearlessly before the people.
Consider the work the banks and bank
ers of this country are doing for the gov
ernment in "the war. Time was when
bankers used to be referred to as cold and
selfish and pompous and unapproachable.
It is different now. The banker is a busy
man. The bank counter is as sociable as
the old sugar barrel in the corner grocery.
They come, not as spies, but in battalions,
to. the banker for about everything nowa
days. He must handle liberty bonds, must
the banker, and handle them in install
ments; he is, the treasurer of the Red
Cross, the French Orphans, the allied
wounded and the allied blind. He sells
baby bonds and income tax blanks and
about everything else that is going or com
ing across the field of war activities. The
extra bookkeeping and added responsibili
ty and widened scope of business, all with
out extra remuneration, on the part of the
banker, big and little, since the war began,
forms no small part of the fine and flowing
tide of patriotism that rolls across the land
today.
A splendid improvement to the district
is that bithulithic roadway over the hill
from Lowell to Warren. It connects up
the Lowell and Warren paved roads and
affords a fine driveway for a heavy volume
of traffic between the business and resi
dence ends of the district. Now for the
Slag hill paving and a connection from the
depot to the paving in Johnson addition.
And then for the Douglas-Bisbee road. The
highways over which passes the heaviest
volume of traffic should come first and
when they do come they should come in
the form of permanent paving only. It
has been proved time and time again that '
nothing but paving upon a concrete foun
dation will stand in this country for a long
enough time to pay for putting it in under
a heavy volume of traffic.
It has been over a week since the Ger
man infantry has been thrown forward in
an effort to break the allied lines. That
last repulse west of Ml Kemmel must have
been a severe blow to German morale. For
six weeks past the Germans have been
burying their dead and sending their
wounded back in endless trains from the
front. Nothing more trying upon the
nerves than this sort of thing. When the
reaction sets in not even German discipline
nor the kaiser's flamboyant speeches or the
stern dictates of the general staff may pre
vail. All of which does not mean that the
German drive is over. Far from it. There
is every indication that the massed waves
will again advance to the slaughter. But
there is every reason to believe that the
fierce, confident, impetuous vigor of the
attacking forces will never again reach the
point from which it has surely receded.
Announcement of the annulment of all
summer round trip rates on the railroads
comes as a severe blow to many people in
Arizona, especially the women and chil
dren who have been in the habit of going'
to the coast or the mountains during the
heated term. However, it effect3 Bisbee
less than any other community in the state,
unless it be Flagstaff. Of course, many
residents of this district journey to the
coast every summer for pleasure and the
great benefits of sea bathing, and the can
cellation of the cheap rates is a privation to
all of these who have been barely able to
make the expensive trip with the aid of the
round trip rates. But it is not a positive
hardship. Really, Bisbee is a summer re
sort. The nights are always cool here, and
the mornings are wonderful, even during
the hottest weather of the summer. And
in July, just when the heat is really becom
ing unbearable, the rains come and cool
the air every other day. We have no lake,
no ocean beaches, no golden orange
groves, .but so far as the climate is con
cerned, it is as cool and pleasant in Bisbee
in the summer time as it is on the Pacific
coast. But for the Arizona communities
not so fortunate- in the matter of altitude
this cancellation of summer trip rates 13 a
serious matter. And the worst part of all
is, cheap summer rates within the state
have also been cancelled. The state cor
poration commission has protested this
latter order, but it is not apt to do much
good, for the U. S. government, not the
railroad management, cancelled those
cheering, happy, health and pleasure giv
ing summer rates; cancelled them in the
cause of the war, which demands every
foot of car space and every foot of track
and every pound of steam for war work.
With the cancellation of round trip rates
to the coast it may be expected that many
more southern Arizona people than- usual
will spend the heated season in the Warren
district, a mile high above the desert heat.
The Wise, strong man prepares for the
worst As well as hopes for the best. One
of the best informed of the American critics
has just written a most serious article on
the German offensive in which he consid
ers the possibility of an allied retreat across
the Somme and the giving up of the chan
nel ports of Calais and Boulogne. It id
possible, he declares, but not probable.
But it must be considered by all brave men.
The Germans are very strong and have a
powerful and a seemingly inexhaustible
supply of shells. They have the advan-
tage of rail communications behind their
front. Another advance on the scale of
the west of LaFere will jeopardize the en
tire allied line. It will force a considerable
withdrawal. But it will not win the war.
It . will not be a death blow. American re
serves will win the war next year. The
allies new face what Germany did last
summer and the summer before. Then
came German reserves from Russia and
the Germans lashed forward again harder
than ever. But there are no more reserves
for Germany. Her cards are all upon the
tables. All her first line troops, all her
landwehr, all her class of 1919 and many
from the 1 920 class have been thrown into
the furnace. That she should gain and
threaten with these forces may be expect
ed. But with the allied armies unbroken
and the allied morale unimpaired, the tide
will turn next spring with the million and
more of American reserves carrying the
stars and stripes for America's full one
third in the offensive, if Foch does not suc
ceed in turning it before that time with a
counter stroke.
About the only announcement from
Berlin for over a week was the claim of a
victory over the Finns. Yes, the Germans
can beat the Finns. They can beat the Bel
gians and the Serbs and the Roumanians.
Their sweeping victories have been over
the small nations, and their blackest crimes
have been committed upon defenseless
peoples. They have bluffed Holland and
intimidated Norway and Sweden, and now
they have, during the interval of burying
their dead on the Flanders fields, defeated
the Finns. Finnish grist goes into the Ger
man mill. But they have France yet to
beat, and England and America. The go
ing on the western front has always been
rough. It is rough still. Upon all other
fronts, however, the German war car has
rolled along as though upon a boulevard.
What many people really thought was
Sidney Osborne's campaign slogan in the
gubernatorial campaign was really only
the echo of Tom Campbell's Win the War
slogan, called across the (mountains and
the valleys of the state last week.
GAVE HIS ALL
FOR THE WAR
One of Phelps Dodge Direct
ors Has Two Sons Wound
ed in France.
Lieutenant William H. Osborn. who
is among the officers mentioned in
General Pershing's casualty list as
having been slightly wounded in ac
tion, is a son of Mr. and Mrs. William
Church Osborn of this city. At the
home of Mr. Osborn it was said last
night that word of Lieutenant Os
born's having been wounded in action
had been received from the War De
partment. Lieutenant Osborn is 24 years old
and a graduate of the 1917 Officers'
Training Camp at Plattsburg. He was
one of the first Pittsburg men to be
ordered to overseas duty and left
New York more than six months ago
with about 1,000 other young Platts
burgers. He was born in this city and
is a Princeton graduate of the class
of 1916. For a brief period Lieuten
ant Osborn served in the New York
Division at Camp Wadsworth. It was
said yesterday that he was serving
with the marines under General Doy
en. Earl Dodge Osborn, an elder broth
er of Lieutenant Os horn's, was wound
ed in France last fall when serving
in the American Ambulance Service.
For bravery under fire he received
the French War Cross. New York
Times.
The William Church Osborn referr
ed to above by the New York paper
is general counsel and one of the di
rectors of the Phelps Dodge corpora
tion. He has given both his sons, his
all, to the war. And yet there were
people who used to say this was a
rich man's war. But the lie has been
given to this assertion so many times
and so emphatically that one seldom
hears this false and foolish express
ion any more.
ELKS SELL MANY
BABY WAR BONDS
IN PIONEER WAY
(Continued from Page One)
of paddle salesmen for one or an
other game.
Many Attractions
Every attraction of the poneer Arl-
iona practically is offered in the Elks-
Wild West carnival. Six crap tables
and six roulette tables form the cen
ter of the gaming devices. Paddles are
sold for each of these attractions
eight paddles to the turn of the wheel
or the throw of the dice.. War stamps
are the reward of the lucky. A wheel
of fortune buzzes on tne of the walls.
Salesmen circulate through the crowd.
Presently a string of game-wild
patrons rush' madly to the wheel.
There is a burr of catch and pins, a
rapid scanning of paddles, and the
crowd disappears to make room for an
other rushing just as madly to the
table.
The scene recalled to the eyes and
minds of pioneers memories of days
gone by. Some there were in the hall
who looked with misty eyes on the
wheels, for they are historic wheels,
wheels over which many residents of
this district have won and lost Urge
sums. Behind one of them was a
typical dealer of roulette his black
Blacky Daw whiskers immaculate, his
eye keen, his fingers nimble as he
sent the small ivory ball on its mission
among the field of numbers.
His name? well, you have one
guess.
Yama Yama Da"ce Tonight
Last night the dance hall was well
filled from the time of the opening of
the wild west attractions. Men and
women came and went. They would
dance a few numbers, watch a few
numbers, and return to the games and
noise below. The music was good. So
was the floor.
Tonight the music will be the same
and the floor will be better and,
Vania Yama costumes will be the or
der of the day. They-have been offi
cially accredited and passed on by
the costumes conservation board of
the government. Just one change has
been ordered. Because of the preval
ence of fair faces i nthe district the
board has put thn taboo on masks
Every one in the district, however, is
expected to attend dressed in the
YamaffeYama costume. But the board
will tfdi eject those not costumed.
Good Sale of Stamps
Monday night nearly $1,000 worth
of stamps had been disposed of
through the wild west attractions. Last
night the sales amounted to more than
double those of the first night and
it is expected that as tbe public be
comes acquainted with the attractions
and learns of the fun in store, at the
club rooms, larger crowds each eve
ning will assist in the sales of tho
stamps.
t Fills Hte Book
Ono man stood beside a roulette
wheel several hours, buying a paddla
at each turn. He was fortunate. Fi
nally he counted several little cards in
his hands.
"Well." he said. "I'm done for the
night. I've just filled my certificate.
Here's $100 worth of baby bonds that
I've purchased this evening."
Others in the audience followed the
fame practice, and each man and w.om
an who entered into the sport of th-
evening did so with the aim of filling
one or more certificates to assist the
government.
Additional Music
Music attractions were numerous
lust evening and will bo as numerous
the rest of the week. On the lower
floor the Jxiretta ' orchestra" was
added to the lists, while halfdoEeni
caharet entertainers furnished num
bers at frequent Intervals.
This evening the Klks club rooms
will be open as they were last night
and the night before to everyone In
the district. They will be open eery
night this week. Wild west will con
tinue undtbtiirlifd mid attractions W
niu uninterrupted a guard on th
doors with scatter guns and buckshot
is running off inquisitive officers to
Insure safety and frivolity. Each man,
each woman, has an invitation to at
tend. Wolfville Days
" Wolfville days! How much that
sayw, what multitudes of things it
brings to mind. One sees a picture
of pretty women and daring men. The
roulette wheel, whirling, bright lights,
gay laughter and snatches of song.
These were in the days when joy was
unconfined, with little or no conven
tions, when men would fight at the
drop of a hat and stake all for a smile
from soft eyes.
Now those days are only memories
in the dim vistas of the past But they
have been dwelt upon and talked over
and dreamed about. Wonderful stories
have been written concerning these
exciting times, and greedily they have
been devoured by every boy and girl
as soon as they are able to read,
thrilling stories that keep one's Inter
est until the bitter end. Not only for
children but by every man and woman
who have red blood in their veins.
For men were brave and honorable
and whe nit came to some gun plav
they were ever ready, if the phrse,
"a good old scout." had been coined
in those days it would have been word
thread bare from much use. Fortunes
were lost and made in a night.
So in Kisbee we have all thesa
things presented to us in imitation
at the Elks club. So realistic do they
seem that it is very hard to believe
that the years havn't been rooled hack
and that some "shooting iron will
soon take an active part.
Many Women Attend
The' women were there in gala at
tire with flushed faces, gambling, and
with a sincere hope that the Goddess
Chance will be kind and continue to
smile for the rest of the week." For
the very best cause in the world, "a
Thrift stamp that will be a war bond
bye and bye.' A note of pathos is
felt when the thought comes of our
fighting men who have so many needs.
But soon it flees with the knowledge
that we are doing all that we can by
buying these baby bonds. Only joyful
thoughts can remain where lichts are
so bright and music is so gay. Stories
that you have heard come flocking up.
and you rub your eyes and expect to
see a dance hall girl come trippin?
in.
The frocks the women wear and the
trim busines ssuits of the men brins
us back out of yesterday. But tne
spirit is the same for human nature
never changes and the primeval is ever
Istent. only glossed and vaneered by
civilization. The fascination of it
holds one spell-bound; the click of the
dice and the sound of shuffling feet
overhead and then an occasional "bet
ting on the red breaks the silence."
Men and women mingling, bending,
above the roulette, earnest, grave and
serene, all good sports, and ?ood
losers, too.
Then to go above and watch the
dance brings ones fancies back 60 or
70 years. A man goes around and
takes up a dime after each dance,
which is very interesting and also very
modern. This is a splendid idea of
charging a dime for each dance, be
cause there are a great many neople
who only care to dance a few dances
during the evening. . This makes It
possible, then they may have mote
money for the gaming table that be
ing the real days of '49.
This week of frivolity at the Elks
club promises to be a memorable
event. Money isn't wasted when buy
ing Thrift stamps, so to squander it
with a lavish hand on these worthy
things- is commendable and jiit look
how much fun one gets doing it.
EL PASO HAS MANY
SOLDIERS IN CAMP
There are thousands of soldiers in
El Paso. They crowd the streets, busi'
ness houses and the hotels, and they
are seen everywhere. Their activities
make the city seem a seething crowd
all the time, and ther training activi
ties at the camps offer a csasinm
source of amusement to residents of
th-9 city.
This is the word brought back to
Bisbee by Tom A. Egan, secretary of
the Warren District Commercial club,
who spen the latter part of last week
in the Pass City on business, and wno
returned here Monday evening to at
tend the Elks' war stamp carnival.
Soldier is not El Paso's boast,
though, says Egan. On the border, n
declares, purity squads have become a
habit ana have invaded the spirit of
the people, and Et Paso now has a
purity squad which is equal if not su
perior to the organization recently
launched in Douglas. Their activities
are numerous and they have been ac
credited with doing much to clean up
the city and make it a more congenial
and wholesome place for soldiers.

Wear your fighting clothes
The business men of this
country can help fight this
war by wearing the right
business clothes.
When you wear clothes
that are all wool, carefully
tailored and made to wear a
long time, you save labor,
materials and money that
are necessary for war work.
Part of our duty is to tell
you how you can help the
cause in clothes and the oth
er part is to have the clothes
that actually do save for
you and the country.

MISS TALMAOGE STAR
IN CENTRAL PICTURE
ENTITLED "SCANDAL"
Portraying the role of the worst
spoiled girl In America, Constance Tal
madge as Beatrix Vanderdyke in
"Scandal," the new Select production,
gives an exceedingly clever study of
the pampered New York debutante,
self willed and high tempered, but
strangely appealing in her moments oi
sweetness. The picture will be shown
today at the Central theater and prom
ises to hit the high water mark in
popularity.
The scenario which Is an adapta
tion for the screen from Cosmo Ham
ilton's famous novel, "Scandal," tells
the story of Beatrix Vanderdyke, a
poor little rich girl, who hardly knows
her own parents, so busy are they
with social obligations. She is left
to her own devices and the adoring
chaperonage of Mrs. Keane, an Eng
lish woman of breeding and charm,
but too weakly fond of her charge to
act as. a curb on Beatrix' impulses.
fight was decided.' The Americans had
won the battle of the night.
No, this was not on the western
front, but it migh tjust as well nav
been, so far as appearances were ccn-
icerned. It was near the end of the
! filming of the great William Fox play,
j'Tor Liberty." at the Eagle theater
I again today, in which Gladys lirock
j well is the star, and a most wonderful
! battle was fought. It was' all" done at
! night, and only the flare of the burst
ing bombs showed the movement and
struggles of the soldiers' and the vic
tory of the Americans.
And this meant the deliverance of
the heroic American girl whose love
I affair dominated the story and who
I was placed in the terrible position of
' a woman who, loyal to her country
i and .to her lover, was caught in the
German Empire wtien all the horrors
of the beginning of the war and its
continuance crashed down upon her.
