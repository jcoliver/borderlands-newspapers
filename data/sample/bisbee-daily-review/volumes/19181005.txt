TEUTONIC ALLIES
DRIVEN BACK ON
BY OUR VICTOR
UNDATED WAR LFAD. (By the
Associated Press.) Nowhere are the
armies of the Teutonic allies being
permitted to rest.' Oo the fronts in
Flanders, France. Italy. Albania and
Turkey the enemy still continues to
lose ground, or is being compelled to
throw strong reinforcements into his
battle line to hold back his opponents.
In Belgian Flanders, the Belgians,
British and French troops are still
driving forward, although their speed
has been somewhat lessened by rea
son of the bad condition of the ground.
The enemy is swiftly evacuating the
salient between Armentieres and
Lens, and the British now .are stand
ing only a scant six mfles southwest
of Lille over a front of about four
miles between Wavrin and Equing
hem, at the former place having gain
ed a position astride the Lens-Lille
railroad.
Notwithstanding violent counter at
tacks and a line strengthened by fresh
reserves the British between St. Quen
tin and Cambrai have materially
pressed eastward from the region of
Le Catelet. and to the north have
improved their positions in Cambria
so well that apparently trs Important
town soon must fall. Taken ail in all,
the situation of the Germans in the
region seems to be critical and the
crisis at hand. Far to the rear aerial
observers report the roads, congested
with retreating troops, who are being
harassed by the machine gun fire of
the airmen. As in Flanders, fires are
everywhere to be seen, and it is evi
dent that the enemy, realizing that he
must give further ground, is vigorous
ly applying the torch.
Around Rheinis the French have
further etxended their gains north and
northwest of the catbeara city, where
they are all along the Aisne canal.
To the east In Champagne American
forces are fighting with the French
between the Suippe river and the Ar
gonne forest, in addition to holding
their original battle line inside and
east of the Argonne forest. West of
the Argonne. with the aid of French
tanks the Americans have taken the
important height positions of Blanc
Mont and the Medeah farm and press
ed further northward.
Simultaneously the French have ad
vanced their front eastward around
Challerange and gained better posi
tions for their operations up the rail
way toward Vouziers and in keeping
the Germans inside the northern por
tion of the Argonne forest by an en-
filading fire through the Aire valley. !
while the Americans press northward
through the forest, driving the enemy
before them. The latest reports are
the the Americans have advanced al
most two miles in the forest and on
the eastern side of the great wood are
slowly pressing northward. Through
out this entire region the Germans
are resisting most stubbornly.
In the mountain region In northe
Italy the Italians on several sectors
have attacked and defeated the Austri
ans, while in Albania the Austro-Hun-garians
are in fast retreat before the
Italian armies. Italian cavalrv is
working far in advance of the infan
try, harassing the enemy. The Sem
enl river in western Albania has been
crossed and the enemy supply center
invaded.
Reports are to the effect that Aus-
tro-Huneard again is seeking peace,
having invited Holland to request the
belligerents to participate in negotia -
tions. The Hungarian premier, who
has arrived In Vienna with a number
of Hungarian statesmen, isquoted as
saying that the Hungarians "again are

AMERICANS PERFORM HEROIC
DEEDS IN SMASHING LINE
(By Review Leased Wire)
LONDON, Saturday. Oct. 5. New
details of the story of the breaking of
the Hindenburg l:ne between Cambrai
and St. Quentin are given in accounts
of the fight received from British cor
respondents. The representative of
the Mail, after referrir.g to the Cana
dian, British and Australian and New
Zealand divisions as Units "whose
daily life was heavy fightinj," says:
"Other divisions had as hrd fight
ing and as glorious a triumph. The
Americans also broke through the
Hindenburg line. Allied airmen had
photographed every tunnel mouth md
every surface feature at low altituds
and these photographs were carried
into action by the American officers
as they advanced through the mist.
"The heat and confusion of the bat
tle robbed the gallant Americans ot
some of their proper reward. It was
not until yesterday that it was seen
how much the Americans had done.
Never have the Germans been seen
In such thick swarths of dead as

cases of heroism now are available.

WITH THE AMERICAN ARMY
NORTHWEST OF VERDUN. (By
the Associated Press.) The American
aviators again covered themselves
with glory and performed almost the
impossible in today's drive. Dawn
broke with mists heavy over the
trenches, and the country across
which the Americans were to go, and
it was hours before the weather clear
ed suTYiciently to permit of any ob
servation to speak of.
The splendid liason that marked the
day's operations and which was near
ly ideal under the circumstances was
due in great part to the work of the
aviators, who rountless tfmes risked
their lives in reconnoitering attack
ing the retreating Germans and bring
ing back reports. To this was added
the fact that the German fliers seem
ed for once inspired by daredeviltry
and bravery equal to the American av
iators and during the entire morning,
particularly in the center of the ac
tion, they swooped over the heads of
the -American infantry only a few
hundred meters above the earth, using
machine guns with telling effect until
driven off.
Chiefly because of this daring, the
German losses were unusually heavy,
and even the American anti-aircraft
batteries accounted for seven ma
chines, which they brought down with
out trouble at the short ranges they
could use. One more German plane
fell to the prowess ct an infantryman,
who was carrying an anti-tank gun,
captured a few moments before, and
which he turned on an aviator just
overhead, bringing him down in
stantly. The Americans resumed the attack
this morning west of the Meuse, and
advanced their lii';s from two to five
kilometers. They captured hill 240,
north of Esermoat. and the villages
of Gesnes, Fleville, Chehery and La
forges. In the face of heavy artillery and
machine gun fire, Illinois. Wisconsin,
western Pennsylvania, Virginia and
West Virginia troops have forced the
enemy back to the Kricmhllde posi
tion, scuth of Forest wood.
After artillery preparations the
J- met leans went over the top at 5.30
and before mid-afternom had attain
ed all their oojectives.
The fighting was of the bitterest
sort, continuing at last accounts at
nearly every point. The Germans sd-
parently were surprised by the attack
which had been expected by them two 1
nights ago. They retreated slightly at i
first without any gfeat artillery ac-1
any gffeat artillery ac
tion or resistance, but then stiffened
and fought like desperate men
throughout the remainder of the day.

LIBERTY LOAN IS
ONE-HALF SPEED
Reports From All Sections

By Review Leased Wire)
WASHINGTON. Oct. 4. The nation
is marching toward its $6,000,000,000
Liberty Loan goal at just a little more
than half the speed required to main
tain a daily subscription rate of $313,
0o0,000. Bond sales officially tabu-
lated from reports of banks were an
nounoei1 tonight by the treasury a3
JS55.132.000. or an increase of $229.-
000.000 in the last 24 hours. This
represents results for the five work
ing days up to last niht. At the
standard rate of $315,000,000 a day,
the record bv this time should have
been $1,575,000,000. National head
quarters today issued a reminder that
only 13 working days remain before
the subscription period end. Oct 19.
Epidemics of influenza have com-j
pelled the abandonment of public loan
meetings in scores of cities, and has
made victims of hundreds of canvass
ers and speakers, but reports to heaj
quarters today told of the quick
change of tactics in many communi
ties by substituting house to house
canvassing for mass meetings.
Oregon and Montana today joined
Iowa in the list of states which have
oversubscribed their quotas.
In proportion of quota already sub
scribed, the St. Louts district leads
all other districts with 42 per cent, and
Boston, despite its being hit hard by
influenza, follows with 2S per cent.
The New York district, though pro
ducing the greatest aggregate of sub
scriptions, is sixth among the eleven
districts reporting. In the whole
country the loan is just 14 per ceut
subscribed.
Subscriptions and percentages of
quotas by districts are as follows:

Atlanta 3.128.050 .016
Kansas City (no report).
Rural districts throughout the west
seem to be farther progressed toward
their goal than urban communities, al
though some farming districts have
delayed the opening of their cam
paigns to let farmers get pressing
work out of the way.
To stimulate farmers even more.
Secretary Houston tonight issued an
apnea, saying:
"The fourth Liberty Loan will not
fail for ick of support of American
farmers. One of the most striking
features of the third Liberty Ian was
the support given it by the farming
snd rural populations. But now we
have a greater effort to make. With
out stint or limit let us buy Liberty
Bonds that we may attain our objec
tive a righteous and lasting world
peace."
Among the records of states or com
munities reported todav was that of
Oregon, which has rolled up 30 per
cent oversubscription, with more sub
scribers than it had in the third loan.

FRANCE, Oct. 4. There is tangible

rear of the breached Hindenburg line
are congested with traffic, and rail -
ways are j;;mm..d with material mov-

roads British aviators have observed
a straggling stream of civilians who
are being hurriedly sent sent from

pecially along the Beaurevoir line, in
the region east of Le Catelet.
The Germans have launched six
powerful counter attacks during the
past twenty-four hours. As a result
of one of them, the Biitish withdrew
for a moment frcm Beaurevoir itself
and from Montbrehain to the western
outskirts of the village. .
For these attacks the Germans used
two divisions which had been released
frqm the line through the capture by
the French of St. Quentin. All other
counter offensives failed utterly. At
the end of them bodies of German
dead were piled hii.h as a result of
the rifle, machine gun and shell fire
and the British were in possession
of vilal lines of the German defense.
The breach that has been made in
the system of defense here is a nar

armored cars which went out to it last
night reconnoitered deeply uround

The health officers so far have
taken no definite action in regard to
the matter of placing quarantine res-'
illations, but should the epidemic be
(,tn spreading there is a possibility
that some such steps will be taken.
Dr. Brown, city health officer, has
written a statement to The Review to
be published prior to the report of the
cases that are now listed, advising the
citizens of the city to report any con
tagious disease and especially any
symptoms of la grippe or influenza.
The article is as follows:
On the approach of winter and the
gathering of the children in the
schools, we. as doctors, parents,
teachers and guardians, must be on
the alert to detect and control in
their incipiency all communicable dis
eases. In these times of stress we
can ill afford to have an epidemic of
anv kind. It is imperative that we
maintain a 100 per cent efficiency. I
fear that some have been a little lax
In reporting and isolatiug communica
ble diseases. I admit frankly that
it works a hardship on the individual
to be shut in for a few days, but I
am sure when the p'ople realize the
Importance of keeping a strict watch
on these diseases, they will willingly
submit to the inconvenience that being
under modified quarantine for a few
iays will cause them. We have a
state law and a city ordinance de
manding that all communicable dis
eases be reported to the health author
ities immediately upon discovery, and
if there is not a doctor in attendance
it is obligatory upon the parents, or
those in charge of the place where
the individual may be stopping, or liv
ing, to report same. For the informa
tion of the public I am giving here a
list of diseases that are communicable
and that are required by law to be re
ported to the health authorities, as
follows:
Report These Diseases
Bubonic plague, chicken pox, den
gue, diptheria, German measles, hy

drophobia, malarial fevel, small pox,
measles, scarlet fever, typhoid fever,1
yellow fever, whooping cough, infan
tile paralysis, epidemic cerebro spinal :
laeniuius, mumps, tuberculosis.
We have at this time a few casus
cf diptheria in the city; some of them
were not reported to me for almost
a week after ttey had been under
treatment, consequently they were
net isolated until after the active
stage of the disease was over and
possibly others had come in contact
with and contracted it. Now I pub
licly upreal to the doc'ors, parents
anj others whos? I'uty it is to report
tlitfe diseases to me promptly The
law -tates that even suspicious cases
must be reported and held under ob
servation until correct diagnosis is
made. I am placing every case of
diptheria reported under quarantine
and am not releasing anyone until I
have secured two negative throat cul
tures. This seemingly works a hard
ship on soma individuals, but it must
be done or we will have an epidemic
of diptheria in Hisbee that will not
only cost a great deal in time and
money, but perhaps human lives as
welL " Some throats clear up mucn
more promptly than others; some
clear up in ten days or two weeks,
while others do not clear up for sev
eral weeks, hence the importance of
keeping everyone under quarantine
until we get the negative throat cul
tures. In this matter, as in all others, that
pertain to the health and happiness
of the people of Bisbee, I earnestly
solicit the co-operation of each and
everv citizen of the town. I want
to give you the best there is in me
wbile I am city health offirer, but
without the co-operation of the peo
ple I must necessarily fail.
I note that Spanish influenza has
made its appearance In at least two
communities in this state, namely
Flagstaff and Winslow. I wish to ad
monish the people and the doctors
Of the city to keep a sharp lookout
lor the appearance of this malady and
report same to this office promptly
in order that we may take every pre
caution against the spread of it here.
The symptoms of Spanish Influenza
re very much the same As those ot
la grippe, beginning with a chill, or
chilly sensations, malaise, headache,
pain in the back and limbs, fever and
catarrhal symptoms.
Watch for these symptoms and call
a doctor promptly upon their occur
rence. By concerted action among
the people, doctors and health au
thorities, we can prevent not only
a serious epidemic of influenza, but
an epidemic of any of the communi
cable diseases.
O. D. BROWN,
City Health Officer.

HUNDREDS ARE
KILLED IN
EXPLOSION
(Continued from Pase Ona)
trians were numerous automobiles
whose drivers also sought safety.
There is no hospital at Morgan. In
addition to the twenty-five doctors
sent from here with several ambu
lances, all surrounding cities and
towns were called upon to provide
medical assistance.
Fire apparatus was summoned from
Rahway, New Brunswick, Perth Ani
boy and even as far away as Eliza
be tii.
South Amboy, located a mile and a
half from Morgan," felt the full force of
the first explosion, which shattered
nearly all the window glass in the
place. As explosion followed explosion,
the population became panic stricken
and fled.
Eight bodies were placed tonight in
the morgue at South Amboy and oth-
f6 "'ST.'"?.
shortly before midnight. It is be
lieved that several more men were in
the building where the original explo
sion occurred, and that these were
biown to atoms.
The plant, which is being operated
for the government by the Gillespie
company, employs several thousand
men and women, working in three
shifts, but officials said that tonight
there were only about 500 men in
the plant when the explosion occurred.
The plant was engaged in loading high
explosive shells.
Following the first explosion, gov
ernment officials telephoned to near
by camps for soldiers to serve as
guards and several hundred, with a
detachment of coast guards, were
rushed to Morgan.
The plant, which covers an area of
twelve square miles, comprises many
small buildings, situated along Ches
sequake creek. The first explosion
occurred in one of these buildings in
which T. N. T. was being made and
the flames, spreading to other strue
tuies, caused a series of further
blasts.
Explanations regarding the cause
of the explosion vary, but according
to one account, excessive heat was
applied to a vat or T. N. T. Anothe-r
account had it that a shell, which
was being lilted, fell and exploded.
The first blast was terrific. It shat
tered nearly all the glass in Snut:i j
Amboy, one and a half miles away,
and was felt for a radius of .'.early
ten miles. !
The fire was stiil burning at a late
hour, but was said to be under con- j
tii'i. The property damage has not i
ijetii estlmatea.
The structure first blown up was
sacn a roaring furnace and a cordon
was thrown around it to prevent rela-
j lives of men employed at the plant

could make no efforts to recover the j

Constan THE BISEEE DAILY REVIEW, SATURDAY, OCTOBER 5, 1913.
THREE
Mining and Financial News
BY REVIEW
i NEW YORK. Oct. 4. In its chiet
characteristics, today's stock market
Xresented no new features of interest.
Shares likely to be adversely affected
by an early termination of the war
atain denoted weakness in contrast
to the strength of many other issues.
Backwardness of rails was again dis
appointing, and combined with the
heaviness of United States Steel de
tracted to no small extent from what
otherwise afforded a substantial basis
for a forward movement of wide pro
portions. Regardless of the restrictions re
cently set up by banking interests and
the extraordinary requirements of the
current Liberty Loan drive, traders
evidently experienced little difficulty
in securing loans for an extension of
their speculative commitments.
These again comprised for the most
part shippings, oils, motors, coppers,
tobaccos, sugars and numerous utili
ties, the latter group probably deriving
their strength from the better outlook
lor financial assistance.
. Many of these stocks registered best
Quotations of the current movement,
and a few mounted to highest levels of
the year. Sales amounted to C00.O00
shares.
Trading in Liberty Bonds was again
very extensive, mainly at accessions,
especially the third 4 i-4s. Local trac
tion issues rose in sympathy with
stocks of that class, but internation
als were easier. Total sales, par value,
aggregated 5S.875.000. Old United
States bonds were unchanged on call.
GRAIN MARKET.
CHICAGO, Oct. 4. Corn traders
showed a disposition today to mark
time and to await development in the
war situation. Prices closed unset
tled, 4c lower to lc advance, with
November $1.30rg to $1.30? and De
cember $1.2S to $1.2S?i.
Oats gained T;c to l?ic and provi
sions 10c to 75c.
Nervousness waa evident throughout
the day in the corn market, notwith
standing that transactions were the
lightest in some time. Liquidation by
holders seemed to be at an end for the
time being, but bulls who held that
peace selling had been premature. diJ
not appear ready for an attempt to
force any radical upturn in values.
On the other hand, shorts were clear
ly more disposed to collect profits
than to incur new risks.
Under the circumstances it took but
small orders to affect the market
either way. A temporary break about
noon carried some prices below yes
terday's inside fiures, "but reports of
a better shipping demand rallied the
market at the last.
Government buying gave strength to
oats. Besides, receipts and country
offerings lacked volume.
Shipping S3les together with the
fixing of a minimum hog price for Oc
tober, lifted provisions. At first, how
ever, pork fell the maximum daily lim
it, an extreme setback of Jj within a
week.
COTTON MARKET.
NEW YORK, Oct. 4 The cotton

Heroes of Yesterday
And of Today
Details of the fighting of last Saturday,
Sunday and Monday to crush the Hinden
burg line from Cambrai to St. Quentin are
just coming to light. Greater valor and
prowess and courage have never been
shown by the human race since Joshua first
set his hand to war. People who have ar
gued that the world was degenerating under
modern conditions of society and industry
are buried under the fall of all the logic of
the structure they have carefully built. And
after all, there was a natural error into
which to fall. In the old times men crawled
out of the cradle on to the back of a war
horse and were enured to toil, danger and
hardship from their youth up. The use of
arms was universal. All difficulties of
transportation and labor had to be perform
ed by the strength of the arm. That those
times should have produced giants in
strength and palladins in courage was per
fectly natural. But none of the exploits
and deathless deeds of the heroes of old
excel those of the English, Australian, Ca
nadian, French and American troops in that
Cambrai-St. Quentin sector the past ten
days. Horatius, who held the bridge at
Rome, excelled the British sergeant who
held the brjdge near Sequehart in neither
courage or execution upon the bodies of
his enemies. Roland and Oliver at Ronces
valies, those matchless heroes of French leg
endary history, did not fight one wit fcetter
or die more greatly than did hundreds of
their French ancestors at St. Quentin. Never
a fighting Saxon of them all of the old days
of England's glory, neither Richard of the
Lion heart or Edward, the Black Prince,
or Sir John Chandos or the Red Guards at
Waterloo struck harder, dared more or
killed as many foemen, man for man as
have the men of the 46th English division
on the Brevoir line or the Canadians north
of Cambrai or the Australians and Ameri
cans at Catalet and Gouy. Scots who ha
wi' Wallace bled, did not shed, or cause
their foes to shed, a drop more of blood
than the Scots who ha' wi' Douglas Haig
bled this day and time. A thousand years
from now men will tell the tale of the ides
of September-October, 1918, in France and
poets will rhyme and minstrels sing it and
their children will carry it on and yet on
with shining eyes and voices that will never
cease and the ears of the world will never
weary of hearing the verse .aid the song
and the tale.
And the men who have wrought these
deeds unexcelled, they are neither knights
or men-at-arms, trained to war from their
youth up, but are simply men from the
shop and farm and store and office of the
English shires and the American states.
They are the sons of the average man.
But blood will tell. French and English
tradition and pride of race carry them on;
American institutions and society and the
miracle breath of freedom keep the Ameri
can soldier abreast of his allies of an older
race. And so it is that those croakers who be
wailed the decadence and degeneracy of the
race are undone by the headlong valor and
Titan deeds of the allied fighting men of
today as they beat the Prussian fighting
men back in the greatest, the most momen
tous and the bloodiest battles of all the
history of the world.
Before this column counts Bulgaria out
of the war entirely those 250,000 German
troops reported to be in Bulgar land must
be accounted for.
The situation in Bulgaria is still obscure.
General Pccoff, a Bulgarian general who
escaped from the western army into Aus
tria, gives out the statement that many of
1 1 io soidiers and civilians of Bulgaria did
rot want an armistice and expresses the
hope iii it German troops may yet turn the
tide in that country against the allies. They
will hive to hurry if they do, for the allies
are, entering Bulgaria in large numbers and
at great speed without beat of drum or
sound of trumpet. The Serbs are already
in Nish. That rail line to Turkey will be
cut at once. It will be quickly checked to
the Bulgar as to what he shall do. If Ger
many persists in keeping her spoon in this
Balkan dish then the Bulgar will either
have to fight his former ally, the Hun, or he
will have to take up again' the burden of
his war with the allies where he laid it
down. And he will have to resume with
three-fourths of Serbia gone and at least
half of his own country and all Kis strong
positions under allied control. And that
Turk rail line will be cut to the south, no
matter what Germany may do.
Lens
While the occupation of the French coal
city of Lens by the allies may well be out
ranked in strategic importance and ultimate
results and conditions as they affect the
trend of the war, yet to this column the tak
ing of Lens stands out as the bright and
shining triumph of the entire conflict. For
three years, off and on, the name of Lens
has appeared in the dispatches as the great
goal of the allied arms. Two years ago
there was a season of three months when
the Canadians were expected every day to
take Lens, but they never did. Hope shone
bright and then flickered and went out.
The heart beat high and then turned sick.
The days, captained by the weeks and led
by the months, went by in campanies and
debouched upon the field of time and still
the black eagle of the Hohenzollerns waved
over ill-fated Lens.
The tide of war ebbed and flowed. Cit
ies were taken and lost; fields wre won
and surrendered; provinces were entered
and evacuated; kingdoms captured and
won again, but still Lens remained the
same, a French city held by the Germans,
and the bravest troops in the world camped,
vain and impotent, before its gates and
mines and towers.
Lerls, with its five millions of tons of
coal output a year, and its lone bulwark in
terposing between the allied armies and
a long stretch of rolling plain, eastward,
clear past Douai, was a prize so rich in ma
terial gain as well as sentiment that it come
to be looked upon as the impossible attain
ment of the war by the combined resources
of the allied nations. Lens had come to
be to the allies what Verdun and Ypres
doubtless are to the Germans who have
beaten against their walls inviolate, so
often and in vain.
And now Lens has been taken! Lens,
the mighty has fallen. Woe is Germany
this day. Its fall is the stroke of doom to
Prussian power. Mark well the hour, for
it shall witness the swift movement of many
armed men marching eastward across the
plains with the Hindenburg line behind
them.
The military critics and generals and
statesmen and historians may all agree that
Lille and Cambrai and Laon and Metz are
the main pillars of the Hindenburg line, but
to this column Lens always stood as the
largest, strongest, most potent pillar of all
the German structure in France.
The taking of Lens not only means coal
for France and cold for Germany, but it
means a flame in the French heart that will
burn hotter than any fire made from coal.
Lens was not alone the greatest coal field
of Europe, but it had come to be the great
est psychological spot in the field of the
European war.
Her dumps are black with slag and her
chimneys are black with smoke and her
buildings are black with powder stains and
her hills and ridges are black with the fury
of war, but the hope and promise for the
future that her conquest by her own peo
ple and their friends from the heavy hand
of the invader shall be as white as the gar
ments of the redeemed as long as men shall
speak of the great war. .
NERVE
(Kansas City Slar.)
The German government has had the
nerve to protest against the use of shot
guns by American soldiers. This protest
comes from a government that has thrown
aside every restriction of international law
intended to mitigate the horrors of war;
from a government that began the bom
barding of unfortified towns, the use of
poisonous gas, the bombing of Red Cress
hospitals, the sinking of merchant vrssels
without warning by submarines, the sack
ing of villages and the shooting of hostages.
And a government guilty of such prac
tices comes forward with an air of inno
cence and protests against American sol
diers using shotguns!

swarms of machine Runs open fire.
The Americans discovered the trick
a few days after the Germans put it
in operation and consequently the
Americans now avoid the decoys. It
has been estimated that only one in
three of the German balloons are oc
cupied by observers.
One of the most important suc
cesses yesterday was In the fighting
on the height in which Meadah farm
is situated. (This point was captured
by American troops aiding the French
in Champagne.) This height gives
the allied artillery command of a
wide stretch of territory which slopes
westward toward the river Suippe
and the valley of the"Suippe and the
river Arones, north of Moronvilliers.
Guns posted on the slopes of Meadeah
height will be able to bombard the
rear of the German positions on the
monts of Champagne, east of Rheims,
and to enfilade their lines of retreat
toward the north.
The German reserves brought up to
defend that height and who could not
do it are continuing today to make
vain counter attacks in an effort to
stop the allied advance.
West of Rheims, General Berthelot's
army now holds the entire line of the
Alsne canal between Rheims and the
river Aisne, excepting bits in the sa
lient of Sapigneul-Moscou and near
the road from Loivre to Courcy. The
canal has been crossed at La N'euvn'.e,
La Godat and Loivre while the posi
tions in the region of Betheny have
been improved.
With one after another of their lines
of communications cut by the allied
forces operating in Champagne, com
bined movements northward in that
region and eastward from St. Quen
tin would make their position gravely
critical. The enemy protection against
such a maneuver is a line secondary
to the Hindenburg position that passes
by Fresnoy and Soissons with a sharp
angle from LaFere along- the valleys
of the rivers Serre and Oise.

THE WIHP CROWDS
EAGLE THEATRE
A record crowd greeted the great
thrill picture, "The Whip," yesterday
at the Eagle theater, great numbers
being turned away that were unable
to obtain seats. The picture from
start to finish was a real thriller and
kept the crowd on edge the entire ev

a close draw between the great train

at the climax that caused the audi
ence to shout and applaud. In. all it is
a picture that all red blooded people
like to witness and one continual
round of action. The picture will be
at the Eagle theater today for the last
time. From there it goes to the Cen

be shown Sunday continuously from 1
o'clock to 11. . All those not having

Amos Shreve. 19 Tank Hill, says:

There was a dull ache in my back over

it would never let up. My back was
as sore as a boil. When I bent over
or tried, to lift anything, sharp pains
would catch me. Doan's Kidney Pills
soon relieved the pains in my back
and after I had used them awhile, I
was cured of all the trouble."

AT THE CENTRAL THEATER
Have you ever had ambitions for a
career on the stage? Have you ever
laid awake nights making plans as to
how you were going to get your
chance and felt that if you ever did
get it you would certainly "make
good" and become a star?
Well, Bessie Love, the Pathe star,
plays a girl with such ambitions in
the Pathe plays, "The Great Adven
turer," which will be at the Central
theater today only. And in this charm
ing photoplay you will see how one
young girl found her chance and
"stole away the show" from those who
had much more experience.

ater in the rip roaring comedy. "The
