CHICAGO. Dec. 5. There was op
timism in the east today that soft
ccal production was slowly increasing
in spite of the miners' strike and
surface indications that changes for
the better were anticipated among
the oDerators. but in the west there
was little improvement and closing
of industry and reduction of business
hours continued.
One-third reduction in passenger
service now has been ordered on
nearly all the government controlled
railroads of the country. The eastern
and southern regional directors today
f rcnrlv tha samo notion as the
directors of the north, central and
southwestern regions took yesterday
on the ordering a one-third reduction
in "train miles," which meant can
cellation of many trains and much
luxury equipment.
Two famous 20-hour trains between
New York and Chicago, the. Twen
tieth Century Limited and the Broad
way Limited, were ordered sus
pended. Tonight traffic men were busily
engaged in . preparing the shortened
schedules. The Chicago, Milwaukee
& St. Paul system had arranged for
cancellation of 36 trains. More than
a dozen fast trains on the Missouri
Pacific, the Frisco and the M., K. &
T. systems were ordered eliminated.
The reduction in tae north, central
and southwestern regions is effective
Monday, in the southern Tuesday and
in the eastern regions Wednesday.
Coal was said to be about 45 per
cent of normal production, and while
fuel administration officials and op
erators were apparently optimistic,
no definite break in the strike was
announced. .
Delegates at a sub-district conven
tion of miners in West Virginia,
called upon 10,000 miners in four
counties to return to work even
Ihough dissatisfied with tTSe 14 per

Governor Cox of Ohio, after a con

to be continued Monday, said pros
pects were good for opening some
of Ohio's mines soon., -' '
Only a few men returned to work
in Missouri, where Governor Gardner
had called out state troops and ap

U.S. CONSULAR AGENT
RELEASED BY MEXICANS;
SITU ATIONSTILL GRAVE
At Same Time American Embassy Notified of William Jenkins' Freedom, Word Is Sent That
Check for $500 Had Been Deposited With Civil Authorities at Puebla, and Doubt
Is Raised As to Whether He Was Released Unconditionally O n Diplo

SEN. PALL
CONFERENCE ST
WHITE HmiSE
President Wilson Receives
Two Delegates From Senate ;
Proves to Be In Touch
With Mex. Situation
WASHINGTON, Dec. 5. William O.
Jenkins, the American consular agent
imprisoned at Puebla, Mex., was re
leased Thursday night.
The American embassy in Mexico
City reported his release in an offi
cial dispatch received by the state de
partment this afternoon and almost
at the same time news dispatches
were received from Mexico City which
said a check for $500 had been depos
ited with the civil authorities at Pu
ebla. .
This difference in the two reports
seemed to raise some doubt as to
whether .Jenkins was released uncon
ditionally on he "" diplomatic " repre
resentation of the United States gov
ernment or whether he had been re
leased on bail, as the Mexican au
thorities contended he could.
The state department, however,
took the view that Jenkins had been
released on its diplomatic representa
tions and issued this statement.
Department's Statement
The annuoncement by the state de
partment follows:
' The release of William O. Jenkins,
the American consular agent at Pu
ebla, Mex., was reported late this af
ternoon from the American embassy
at Mexico City.
"The secretary of state announced
that a dispatch from the embassy
stated that Third Secretary Henna of
the embassy, who was sent to Puebla
in connection with the department's
representations for the Immediate re
lease of Jenkins, had reported that
Jenkins was released from the peni
tentiary last night.
"Jenkins was abducted October 19
and the American embassy was im
mediately instructed to take all pos
sible measures to effect his release
from the bandits who had robbed and
kidnapped him. Jenkins was released
on ransom, returning to Puebla Oct.
28; was taken to a hospital on yiat
date and was arrested Nov. 15 by the
Mexican authorities and taken ' into
custody.
Reason for Release
"The release of Consular Agent
Jenkins was brought about by urgent
diplomatic representations made by
this' government and the resulting in
vestigation made by General Pablo
Gonzales. Gonzales was sent to Pu
ebla by the Mexican government to
Investigate the facts in the case. The
investigations by General Gonzales,
who was at Puebla on December 3,
had then practically substantiated the
position tuken by this government on
behalf of Jenkins.
"Two peons from Santa Lucia ad
mitted to General Gonzales that they
had made declarations against Jenk
ins under threat of execution. Other
; witnesses testified they had been
compelled to make false statements
I against Jenkins under duress. One
witness was threatened with a pistol,
another suspended by a rope and still
j another beaten until he made his dec
laration against Jenkins. These facts
I are shown in the court records in the
! case."

TODJy
Court Refuses to Instruct the

Intimating It Believed
Pandolfo Guilty
CHICAGO, Dec. 5. Evidence was
completed in the Pan Motor fraud
trial and arguments were begun to
day. Judge Landis refused motions
by defense lawyers to instruct the
jury to find the defendants not
guilty.
" "It is only for the court to end ne
prosecution where there is no'evi
dence at all against the defendant
not to put his own interpretation on
evidence which admits of two Inter
pretations," said the judge, in the
absence of the jurors.
He contended that in the case of S
C. Pandolfo the evidence not only
made it possible but necessary to
convict him, in his opinion. He dis
cussed the case of the other 12 de
fendants, ending with the eight di
rectors of the corporation who live
in St. Cloud, Minn., the site of the
Pan plant.
'I have a lot of sympathy for what
you said about these eight men," he
told Senator R. IT. Brower. "I am
not saying what I do as a juror,, but
as a judge I cannot dismiss them
now."
"One thing I must say I cannot un
derstand; that is the professions of
enduring confidence which these
men have expressed in the author
of all this.
"There is another thing I want to
say, and that is that the nffirmativa
willingness of the corporation to
take Liberty bonds for its stock is
not nice. I'll go farther than to pay
it isn't nice. It is a contemptible
way to sll stock.''

The men were taken to jail, each
one charged with conspiracy and in

Those, who were unaple to furnish
bail, and they constituted the ma
jority, .were taken tonight to the
county jail at Washington, Pa. All
were foreigners, it was said, except
seven.
The raid was the culmination of a
campaign by the authorities to rid
the community of men who, they said,
have been suspected of being impli
cated in bomb explosions here. It
I was carried out soon after another ex
plosion had startled the town early
today. Felix Burkhardt, a carpenter
employed by the American Steel and
Wire company ,was the victim, his
building damaged but none of its oc
cupants hurt. Shortly after the ex
plosion Lithuanian hall was sur
rounded by policemen. -i n-o con
stables forced their horses up to the
steps leading from the street to the
building ,and riding down the center
aisle, they ordered the men assem
bled there to leave. As they emerged
from the building they were - taken

for an unknown number of mounted
and heavily armed Mexican bandits,
who last night raided and looted a

bandits, alter the raid, immediately
crossed the Rio Grande into Mexico,
whence they are supposed to have
come. They carried away all the
provisions in the store, but aside
from binding and gagging the store
keeper, did not molest anybody on
the ranch, according to reports.
Texas rangers from Laredo were
en route for the scene late tonight.
The identity of the bandits still is
undetermined. A number of Mexican
federal soldiers are reported garri

The feature of the third day of The Review's straw vote on presidential
favorites was the strength shown by Frank O. Lowden, governor of Illinois,
who, though far behind Senator Hiram Johnson and General Leonard Wood
for the Republican nomination, received a number of ballots, and is makinj
a good showing in the district.
Another surprise is the fact that so far no votes have shown up for
Governor Coolidge of Massachusetts, for whom a boom was recently started
as a presidential possibility.
Hiram Johnson continues to lead both for the Republican nomination
and in total number of votes received for any one candidate. General Wood
is second in total number of votes received, and is giving Johnson a close
race for Republican honors. More Woods -coupons have been received in
.nis office than for any of the Democratic candidates!
William G. McAdoo continues to lead in the Democratic race, but appar.

NEW YORK, Dec. 5. Alexander
Berkinan and Emma Goldman. Amer
ica's two most notorious anarchists,
spent tonight at Ellis island. They
were surrendered to the immigration
authorities at noon upon the demand
or the department of labor to await
depot tat ion to Russia after preach
ing their doctrines in the UniirU
States for thirty years.
While they were on the way to the
island, accompanied on the govern
ment ferryboat by a few of their most
devoted followers, their counsel.
Harry Weinberger, was appearing
before Federal Judge ' Mayer with a
petition for writs of habeas corpus
in a last effort to nullify the depor
tation decree. The writs were grant
ed and are returnable Monday. Wein
berger said lie would insist that his
clients be produced in court before
Judge Mayer, who sentenced them
to two years for obstructing the draft
law.
There was no way of determining
tonight whether the legal proceedings
would delay the departure of Berk
man and Miss Goldman for Russia.
The government has not announced
when it expects to have a ship avail
able to carry them away and Wein
berger declined to state whether he
would take their cases to the United
States supreme court if the lower
courts decide against them. It was
pointed out, however, that the 130.000
in Liberty bonds used as bail for
them would be available to carry on
a lr-gal battle if it is considered worth
while.
The habeas corpus decision was
based upon the contention that Miss
Golumau is an American citizen .by
marriage, that the constitutional
ight of free speech has brought with
in the pale of the law any radical
utterances they have made and that
deportation to soviet Russia would be
illegal because the United States
has not recognized the Bolsheviki.
Meanwhile I:erkman and Miss
Goldman will be held at Ellis island
with 82 other radicals awaiting de
portation. After they were surren
dered taoday. searched and inspected
by doctors, Berkman was put in a
room with seven ringleaders of the

Warden Joe Prochaska has issued a

which he is urging a break" of diplo

callers were informed that William

generally as relieving somewhat relations-between

It is true that the Dort is more than ordinarily
economical in the use of gasoline and oil.
Its tire mileage, likewise, is visibly higher than
is usual.
The sum of your savings in these three points
will run up to an appreciable amount in the
course of a season.
But you will find the most noteworthy econo
my of the Dort in such items as overhauling,
tuning up and replacements.
It requires the minimum of service attention to keep
it in f.t condition and continuous service.
Two factors are chiefly responsible for this. They
typify the Dort idet In manufacture.
Ore is the skill and painstaking precision which
characterizes every step in the process of production.
The other is the extreme simplicity and accessibility
of Dort construction.
Tho first provides yoa with a cr that is certain to
travel smoothly, ably, quickly and reliably for a long
time.
The second makes it possible for you yoursilf
without expert and expensive assistance to adjust,
tune-up or "dope" up any part when that should be
come desirable.
Your poprecition of the Dort will grow with every
mile you drive it and every month you own it. Terms
to suit.

A bonus system to be adopted by
the E. A. Tovrea company, as an
nounced by Mr. Tovrea. president of
that company and also hdid of the
Arizona Packing company, will be of
considerable benefit to Ihe employes.
Each e:iploe who lias been with
the company a year or more will re
ceive on Christmas day a $100 share
of stock in the Arizona Packing com
pany, which has a new half million
dollar packing plant being constructed
near Phoenix. This plant will have
a capacity of l.'toO hogs daily.
Under Mr. Tovrea's bonus system
each employe will receive a bonus of
six per cent on salary drawn during
thf year. If the bonus amounts to
$90. the balance of fluwill be charged
to the employe on the books of .the
company: If the balance amounts to
$120, the $20 will be credited on the
books. . .
Ucvause of the big "future Mr. Tov
rea sees in the Arizona Packing com
pany, he is anxious to have every
employe a stockholder. The stock of
the company will pay seven per cent
up to the time the new plant is in
operation, and it is believed it will
pay annual dividends of 15 t 20 per
cent.
The gift of the shares to -his em
ployes trails no strings, Mr. Tovrea
Stated, and added that the company
would bo willing to buy back the
share at $100 the day after Christmas
from any employe who prefers not to
keep it. The company also holds the
right to buy in the stock at any time
as the corporation is a closed one,
with no stock on the market.
Football and the changing hues of
autumn foliage have their share of the
president's attention on the day after
revolution had broken out in Colom
bia and his gre.it ambition to launch
the Panama canaT project was in
jeopardy.

Homesick for Sagamore Hill

DEAR TED: " ' . '
Three cheers for Croton! It was
first-class.
On election day I saw the house,
and ii was all f,o lovely that I felt
fairly homesick to be back in it. The
Japanese maples were still in. full
leaf and were turning the most beau
tiful shades or scarlet imaginable.
The oid barn, I am sorry to say,
seems to be giving away at one end.
Renown now behaves very well
about automobiles and indeed about
everything. He is, however, a little
touched in the wind. Bleistein, in
spite of being a little shaky in one
foreleg, is in splendid spirits. an,d
eager for any amount of go. When
you get on here for the Christmas
holidays you will have to try them
both, for if there is any fox hunting
I am by no means sure you will find
it to take Bleistein than Renown.
Sister is very handsome and good,
having had a delightful time.
That was a funny trick which the

she makes the house feel like home

Joy Over a Football Victory

DEAR KERMIT:
Tonight I was preparing to dic
tate "a message to congress concern
ing the boiling caldron on the Isth
mus of Panama, which has now be
gun to bubble over, up came one of
the ushers with a telegram from you
and Ted abcut the football match.
Instantly I boited into ' the next

when we came to the Rah! Rah!

Vice-Mother of the Children
White House, November 15. 100P,.
DEAR KERMIT:
Didn't I tell you about Hector,
Srlc- :nd Sailor Boy (dogs) when 1
saw them on election day? They
were in excellent health, lying around
the door of Seamon's house, which
they had evidently adopted as their
own. - Sailor Toy and Brier were ex
ceedingly affectionate; Hector kind
ly, but uninterested.
Mother has gone off for nine
and as usual I am acting vice-
mother. Archie and Quentin are re
ally too cute for anything. Each
night I spend about three-quarters
of an hour reading to them. I first
of all read some book like, Algonquin
Indian Tales, or the noetTy of Scott
or Cacaulay. Once I Iliad them Jim
Bludsoe, which perfectly enthralled
them and made Quentin ask me at
least a hundred questions, including
one as to whether the colored boy
did not find sitting on the safety
valve hot. I have also been reading
them each evening from the Bible.
It has been the story of Saul, David
and Jonathan. They have been so
interested that several times I thave
had to read them more than one
chapter. Then each says his prayers
and repeats the hymn he is learning,
Quentin usually jigging solemnly up
and down while he repeats it. Each
finally got one hymn perfect,
whereupon in accordance with pre
vious instructions from mother I
presented each o them with a live
cent piece, Yeserday (Saturday) I
took both of them and Ethel, to
gether with the three elder Gar
field boys for a long scramble down
Rock Creek. We really had great
tun.

A President's Poor Protection
White House, November 28; 1903.
DEAR KERMIT:
It was very sad at Uncle Gracie's
funeral and yet lovely, too, in a way.
for not only all his old friends had!
turned out. but all of the people con-,
nected with the institutions for which'
he had worked during so many ,
many years also came. There were
a good many of the older boys and!
employes from the Newsboys' Lodg-j
ing House and the Orthopaedic Dis-j
pensary, etc. Uncle Jimmy possess
ed a singularly loving and affection
ate nature and I never know any one
who in doing good was more careful
to do unostentatiously1. I had no
idea how much he- had done. Mother
with . her usual thoughtfulness had
kept him steadily in mind while I
have been governor and president; i
and I now find th?.t he appreciated
her so much, her constant remem
brances in having him on to visit us
on different occasions. It was a les-,
son to me, for I should probably
never have thought of it myself; and,'
of course.when one does not do what
one ought to do, the excuse that one
erred from thoughtlessness instead
of wrong purpose is of small avail.
The police arrangement at the
church were exasperating to a de
gree. . There were fully 500 police
men in the streets round about, just
as if there was danger of an attack
by a terccious mob; and yet though
they had throngs of policemen in

Hundreds of Arizona stockmen are
in danger of losing their title to
brands because of their neglect to
file applications for re-recording In ac
cordance with the new law, delates
Ed. W. Stephens, secretary of the live
stock sanitary board of Arizona
Out of 20,000 brands recorded dur
ing the past 20 years, approximately
one-fourth only have bene filed for re
recording. December 12th has been
fixed by law as the final date on
which applications for re-recording
may be filed with the livestock board.
After that date it will be necessary for
the owner of the livestock to secure a
new brand and pay a $5 fee for the
same. All brands which have not been
re-recorded by that time will be sub
ject to re-distribution and distributed
to applicants in the order filed with
out regard to their previous use.
From the above it will be seen that
immediate action must be taken by
stockmen if they would avoid endless
confusion, not only with reference to
their own brands, but to the live
stock industry in general.
All applications for the re-recording
of brands should be addressed to Ed
W. Stephens, secretary of the live
stock sanitary board of Arizona, State
Capitol, Phoenix.
Secretary Stephens desires to make
clear that those who have already fil
ed applications need have no concern.
It will tak eseveral weeks to complete
the work of re-recording and there
may be some delay in the matter of
receiving certificates, but those on
.file on or before December 12 may
rest assured that their interests will
be fully protected.

A THOUGHT FOR THE DAY
"How much time he gains who does not look to see what his
neighbor says or does or thinks, but only at what he does himseir,
to make it just and holy." Marcus Aurelius.
THE CITY PAVING
THE rapid -progress which has been made on the city paving job
despite recent inclement weather should be a matter 3f pride
with Bisbee citizens. Likewise a matter for civic pride is the
cheerful, ungrunibling nature with which the citizens have
borne the inconveniences to motoring and pedestrianism involved
in the torn-up condition of the streets during the past few weeks.
Pouring of concrete in Main street began yesterday, and, says
City Engineer Halleck. if the weather gods are propitious, the pav
ing job should be entirely complete by January 6 one month from
today. The engineer has been quick to take advantage of the sun
shiny days following the recent storms, and the work in all par
ticulars is progressing at a rapid rate.
The handling of a $200,000 paving job through the heart of the
busiest section of the city, in the midst of all kinds of traffic, and
under adverse weather conditions, is no sinecure, and City Engineer
Halleck is to bo complimented on the big amount of werk' already
dene aa well as the precision and efficiency with which the work
is now progressing.
L
LEGION FOR CLEAN SPORT
THE greatest boost the boxing game in this section could receive
has been given it in the official public endorsement of the
sport by L. A. Engle Post of the American Legion. The ex
service men have always stood for clean sport one of the great
est and most beneficial factors in their army training. And in endors
ing the boxing game as conducted under the state boxing bill, the
Bisbee Legion has announced that it is taking this action because
the sport has been conducted on a clean basis by the promoters. In
this the Legion has spoken truth, and it is up to the promoters to
continue to deserve the reputation given them by the ex-service men
by continuing to keep the boxing gam on a clean, high plane through
out the state.
DEMOCRACY BEATS BOLSHEVISM AGAIN
THERE arc sure signs that the world is recovering from the men
tal disturbances caused by the great war.
The greatest of these mental disturbances i Bolshevism.
Thoughtless people did not seem to realize that the new order
in Russia was purely neurotic a clear case of nerves on the part of
the semi-barbaric people of the Muscovite Empire. And our own
neurotics, in parlors and without, could not see in their state of mind
that Bolshevism was nothing more nor less than a swing from one
autocratic 3jstem of government to another autocratic system of
government.
If the violent swing of the pendulum is not moderating in Russia,
it assuredly is in the western lands. In the election in Massachusetts
and France recently the Bolshevists were everlastingly snowed
under.
Now we hear from Winnipeg. Some months ago the Bolsheviks
started a general "strike" in Winnipeg with the clearly proved inten
tion of taking over the local government. Having in mind the ex
periences during a like effort in Seattle last January, they met with
some successes at the beginning. For two weeks or more, the situ
ation in Winnipeg certainl was fierce; the whole populace seemed
to be on "strike." But presently the forces of law and order, and
also of justice and righteousness, began to get the upper hand and
the thing called "strike," misnamed for civil war, slowly died "down
and out.
. But the municipal election was approuching. The Bolshevists,
notwithstanding their repugnance to democracy and any expression
of majority rule, determined to grab the city government by the
orderly method of the ballot box. They nominated a candidate for
mayor, one S. J. Farmer, while the friends of democracy renominated
Mayor Gray, who went through the revolution staunchly fighting the
Bolshevists at every turn.
Thus the issue was clean cut. The election has just been held.
In a total of something like 25.000 votes. Mayor Gray has won by a
rousing majority over 2000 at latest accounts.
The people can always be depended upon for sanity in the long
run. m
LENDING TO EUROPE
EUROPE must hae American goods. Otherwise Europe's years
of poverty will be multiplied and eventually America will be
made poorer, too.
When one country buys goods from another, it pays in
gold or in exported goods of its own or by selling transportation
space on its ships. Europe has no gold for export, very littlo goods
and limited shipping space.
There remains credit. If Europe can borrow money in America
to pay for American goods, the present critical situation can be met.
The transaction .is familiar to every small town where the local bank
loans money to buy raw materials or semi-manufactured goods. Then
it turns out the finished product. Alter the finished product is sold,
the mill repays its loan out of the profits.
Europe wishes to copy that process. But, there is a difference
in Europe's case. Europe wants to spend American money in Amer
ica to take out of the country American materials. That means
making Europe America's own rival lor America's products.
Borrowed money usually is spent more extravagantly than earned
money. Europe's needs, too, arc more Immediately pressing than
America's. Therefore, unless checks are devisd. the Europeans
would use their American loans to bid up American prices. So, the
cost of living would advance again.
American loans' to help Europe shouldn't be used against the
American people. Nevertheless, the loans must be made if Europe
is to be made self-supporting within a measurable number of years
and without an international catastrophe. Therefore, fair prices
must : be established by government ..regulation which is the only
effective means. There, must be a limit, too. to the quantity of
American goods sold abroad. This limit would force, the Europeans
to scatter their purchases. Thus, Americans wouldn't suffer a do
mestic shortage of any product by going to Europe's assistance.
Germany can t pay what she owes until she gets on her feet, and
if tjlie get n her foot she may refuse to pay it.
THE PLEASANT WAY
A pleasant way is the Christmas way,
With youngsters dancing upon it,
And the lift and lilt of a music gay.
And the joy of the world to sun it.
A pleasant way, as it keeps its faith
In the old dreams and the fine.
With childhood brimmed and the rosy wraith
Of the love that grows divine.
A pleasant way, whjpre the plodding throngs
. Go by with hop and skip,
And .always breathing the song of songs
And whistling with puckered lip.
A fairy way for the hosts of strife
To find when the time draws near.
So beautiful with the dreams of life,
And sweet with the Christmas cheer.
PEPY'S DIARY IN BISBEE
Dec. 5. Up early, and to work in the house, having Vorae things to do
that I could better accomplish at home. So all the doors closed, to keep
my wife from wrecking my plans, and my fingers busy with the typewriter
all morning, which made her think so well of me that she went out of her
way to. prepare a pleasant lunch, which made me come to town later with
the thought that a married man's life is not so hard, after all, if he knows
how to take a little sweet, with ell the bitter that comes his way. To Mr.
Cassidy, with whom I talked about the opposing chances of Leonard Wood
end Hiram Johnson, and we ended the discussion with the decision that
Charlie Roberts has as much chance for governor as Emma Goldman has
for a place in the Intcrchurch World movement. To Lowell, where I talked
with Mr. Seeley about the prtze fights, and the bets, but find that there is
little money being wagered, but things may chaie before that date. To
Brewery Gulch, where I found a crowd much distracted between a dog fight
and a toy ballocn that had broken its string and was soaring towards Tucson.
To the postoffice, where I congratulated Mr. Bailey upon the exquiiifce,
choice he has displayed in the choosing of his lady clerk3, which I think
is one of the reasons why the postoffice is so crowded throughout the day.
To Main street, where 1 watched the workmen getting ready for the pave
ment, and much pleased at the comments I heard on the sidewalk, together
with praise for Mr. Halleck, .who was very busy on the Job. The town quiet,
with the exception of a story about Mr. Faust, who is said to be in trouble
Egain. which is not news. To Mr. Massey, who is outlining a big story for
me, and he is so good about it that I, too, think it will be worth reading
when it is printed. To bed early, having a cold, and much pleased at find
ing the hot water bottle again between the sheets.-

"A WORD AS TO CLOTHING.
Clothing worn in the house in win
ter should not be thick and heavy,
as the body is then kept too warm,
perspiration forms, and chilling oc
curs when going out-doors. It is
much better to wear thinner clothing
and put on thick wraps when going
outside.
Woolen material is best in winter,
as it is a poor conductor of heat. It
lalso absorbs moisture and checks
the. evaporation of perspiration.
Several thin, loosely woven gar
ments, are wanner than a thick one.
The advantage results from the lay
ers of warm air inclosed between
lhe meshes of the material.
Undergarments, when made of
wool, frequently, irritate the skin, so
merino, which is a mixture of wool
and cotton, is generally used in its
place for this purpose.
Underclothes should be frequently

STUFF FDR-USE
B
By FRED TURBYVILLE
They're 'stealing baseball's stuff
for use on the gridiron. They're
now talking about the "breaks" in
the game and they are right, too.
More games have been won and lost
through breaks than . ever , befoie in
gridiron history. In almost every im
portant game there has been a beak
that tuned victory into defeat. In
stances are numerous.
Getting down to the cause is not so
difficult. The forward pass and
many tries for field goals made many
breaks. '
In one of the greatest t games of the
year, the Illinois-Ohio battle, for the
western ' championship, there were
breaks, two of them, in that game
Illinois apparently had cinched vic
tory with its touchdown in the first
period.1 The teams were, evenly
matched and after one . aadhing run
down the field by,.Ste'rnaman of Illi
nois, there was no scoring- until in j
the second half. i
And then, with defeat staring them
in the face and the hearts of the j
Ohio State crowd mighty heavy. Chick
Harley made good on a forward pass.
It was a long one and into a corner J
of the field. Harley had missed pass i
after pass. No one thought this one j
would succeed. There was no one on
hand to take it. But from somewhere
a crimson warnor tore loose ana .
raced madly toward the falling ball. :
He got it. Ohio scored a touchdown i
on the next play and then kicked a I
goal, putting them into the lead one
point. They then appeared certain
winners, for the time was getting
short and the teams resumed their
death grip in the center of the field.
They might have gotten by with a
victory, but they tried a place kick
from almost the middle of the field.
Here came another break. The kick
was blocked and the ball rolled for
yards and yards back of the Ohio
team. It must have bounced and roll
ed 20 yards. An Illinois player final
ly fell on it and the next minute
Fletcher kicked a field goal and time
was up. i ' . -. - :
There were breaks In the Yale

game. They counted. The breaks
went to Pittsburg against West Vir

ginia against Princeton.
Many of the breaks have been
made by the team benefiting, the
same as a good team makes its
breaks in baseball, but it seems more
noticeable in football where for years
and years the spectators have been
accustomed to seeing the team
tsrongest physically, the one fastest
and most proficient in all lines, win
its games. The game is getting trick
ier year by year, They're talink more
chances than they formerly did and
when they take chances "breaks" are
going to come, fpr or against the
ones taking chances.
This largely has been responsible
for the many upsets in football this
fall. The same probably will be true
o fthe season of 1920.
Football is a changed game.

ON GRIDIRON
Bowling Results I
Four matches were bowled on the j
Y. M. C. A. alleys last night. In or-
der that no local contests might in- i
terfere with the big Douglas cup j
match tonight, the tournament games
scheduled for tonight Were bowled j
last night at 6:30, when the C. Q. j
Supply Department bowled the E. P.
& S. W., wHile the C. Q. Shop and the ,
Pickups battled on the other alleys, j
The latter match aroused a great deal
of interest among the spectators, and
when the Shopmen won, overcoming
a handicap of 103 pins, the enthuiasm
was unbounded, especially among the
members of the P. D. Store No. 2
team, who were on hand waiting fori
their match with the Hopefuls; for if
they were successful in their coming
match it meant that they would ad
vance to second place over the heads
of the Pickups. As it later developed,
however, thij hope was unfounded,
for the Hopefuls won out after a
hard fought contest and the Hopefuls
and P. D. Store No. 2 retain their
relative positions.
In the other early match the E. P.
& S. W. won from the Supply Depart
ment with the assistance of a handi
cap which overwhelmed their oppon
ents. The match Jaetfeen the C. Q. mine
and P. Dv Stone fio. 1 teams was won
by the former.
The scores of the evening matches
were as follows:

MEYER BOOT CALLED OFF;
KRAW1ER LINGOLN SUBSTITUTED
All the bitter disappointment which
was occasioned by the announcement
of Promoter French yesterday after
noon which conveyed the news that
Happy Woods was forbidden by his
physician to enter the ring with
Johnny Myer here December 11, was
completely dissolved late last night
when a second announcement by
French carried the tidings that Ralph
Lincoln and Danny Kramer woukl
meet in the main event. No better
match could iiave been signed up had
Matchmaker Frank Loughery looked
the world over at his leisure and if
fans who have already purchased
their tickets for the fight are not
satisfied, it is doubtful whether it is
within the power of man to help them
reach that state of mind.
Lincoln and Kramer met in Tucson
several weeks ago in one of the fast
est and most1 . vicious fights ever
staged in that city, newspaper ac
counts stated. Kramer won on a foul
after the referee had repeatedly warn
ed Lincoln. The Tucson Citizen bit
terly denounced Lincoln for his rough
tactics, but in a subsequent articlo' ad
mitted that the fast little bantam
weight had fought clean In all pre
vious fight3 and suggested another
meeting with Kramer. Lincoln ex
pressed an eager desire to redeem his
lost reputation and when he cteps
Into the ring hero it can be safely

Fight Not Arranged
Owing to the indisposition of Pro
moter O. S. French, who is suffering
with grippe, the proposed trip to
Douglas to arrange fo ra finish fight
between Frank Loughery and Kid
Palmer in Naco on Christmas day
was canceled yesterday. It is ex-
of a scheduled ten round bout. Prac,
tically all of his opponents during the
last few months have gone the k. o.
route and unless Lincoln displays all
of the skill he is noted for in his
fight here Dec. 11, he may wake up
to find the janitor sweeping out the
Grand theater.
Reason for Wood's sudden with
drawal is given by his manager as in
fected eyes. In his fight with Deraa
ries last week his left eye was opened
and during training this week it was
reopened and became infected. His
physician prtmounced his condition as
serious and forbade him entering the
ring for several weeks.
The remainder of the card will be
as formerly announced, unless unfore
seen obstacles arise, with Bob Collins,
the hard hitting Bisbee heavyweight,
and Kid Johnson who disposed of
some of the best in Arkansas appear
ing in the semi-final six. round go.
Tony Ochoa, of Tucson, and George
Burns, of Lowell will mix six rounds
providing one or the other, both of
whom carry a healthy wallop, does
not land on the spot he aimed for.
Battling Herrera and Young Griffo
will be seen in the curtain raiser.

UNIVERSITY OF ARIZONA'S
FINE FOOTBALL RECORD
The lid having gone down on foot
ball at the University of Arizona, a
summary of the season's games puts
the Wildcat eleven close to the best
in the southwest. Arizona lost but
one game, that being to Pomona.
The varsity blanked all their oppo
nents but one and never failed to
score in a game. Of the' three Cali
fornia elevens on the varsity sched-
ule this year, Pomona won, Whittier
forfeited and Occidental was defeat
ed. Pomona won from Occidental
20 to 7, while the Wildcats whipped
the Tigers 27 to 0. The University
of Southern California defeated the
Tigers by a similar score to Ari
zona's victory over them.. Occidental
won from Whittier, Throop and Red
lands. Throop won from Redlands
7 to 6. Pomona went down at the
hands of U. S. C. These two elevens
divide honors in southern California
for the best team. Redlands will
likely claim the third best.
In New Mexico and Texas, the re
sults are likewise complicated. The
University of New Mexico has the
best record in that state. They won
from the Texas Miners 56 to 14, and
the Wildcats walloped the Miners 46
to 0. Arizona put down the New
Mexico Aggies 33 to 0.
These scores place the U. S. C,
Pomona, University of New Mexico
and Arizona as the four best elevens
in the southwest, but farther- details
would have to be worked out to clas
sify these, teams.
The season's results for the Ari
zona team follow:
Arizona 59; Temple Normal 0.
Arizona 60; Phoenix Indians 0.
Arizona 20; Camp Harry Jones 0.
Arizona 33; N. M. Aggies 0.
Arizona (2); Whittier 0.

BY REVIEW
STOCK 8 AND BONDS
NEW YORK, Dec. Announce-
mfnt that the eovernment had decid-!
ed to abide by the decrees of the
lower courts in one of the long pend
ing Southern Pacific oil land cases,
was the outstanding feature of to
day's professional and irregular stock
market.
The news, which preceded the open
ing of the session, was followed by
wild trading in Southern Pacific at
an extreme rise of 14 points to 109.
The convertible 5 per cent bonds rose
8V& points and Associated Oil, a
Southern Pacific property, 15 points.
Many other stocks were favorably in
fluenced. ,
Rallies of the last hour were fea
tured by motors and the principal
food shares, reinforced almost at the
end by the greater strength of United
States Steel and violent advances in
Mexican and Pan American petro
leums, the oils gaining five points
each, while General Motors retrieved
the better part of its severe loss.
Sales amounted to 1,050,000 shares. j
Bond dealers reported a better de-
m f -v nroo(Tnant (ociloc Kilt Yt a
was not apparent in dealings on the
exchange, where heavy transactions
in Liberty and Victory bonds were
again showing irregularity. Total-
sales, par value, $22,400,000.. Old
United tSates bonds were unchanged
on call. ;

Denies Govt. Placed j
Tax On Silver Ore
"Theie has been no increase in thej
tax levied on silver ore or bullion j
exported from Mexico and there is;
no likelihood of such an increase," j
the Mexican consul and inspector ofi
customs at Xaco, Sonora, is quoted!
to ha-.'o stated. I
"The Mexican government," he i
claimed in the interview, "has adopt-j
od a policy calculated to attract
American capital into Mexico, and
such a tax would certainly send
away investors." ,
Explaining that such a. statement
of tax increase must have been cor
rupted from a previous bill passed
which provided that 50 per cent of
all bullion exported must be sold to
the Mexican government. New York
silver quotations on the day of re
ceipt to govern the price paid, the
consul claimed the bill to be a guar
antee of a market to the producer.
Such a market also saves the export
tax, which Mexico levies on silver
ore and bullion.
This bill was made necessary, the
consul asserted, by the shortage of
silver currency in Mexico, and has
no other object than to supply this
deficiency.
