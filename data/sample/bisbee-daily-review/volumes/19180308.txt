Weapon Available
American naval officials appear to
be satisfied that the weapons with
w.iich they expect to crush finally, the
Bui.marine menace are forthcoming.
Increased numbers of patrol vessels of
various types, appliances and devices
to make them more effective against
uncler-water craft and the increased
skill of navy personnel are among the
things upon which they" count. It has
tsken time to devise and build the
weapons but they are beginning to be
come available.
When the United States entered th

United States Is
Protesting Taxes
Levied in Mexico
(By Review Leaded Wire)
WASHINGTON. March 7. Mex
ico has been resquested by the
American government to dilay
enforcement of and reconsider its
decree of last February 22. im
posing heavier taxes on oil pro
ducers and cancelling oil Hases
made since April 30. 1917. Both
American and English operators
in th Mexican fields have pro
tested that the new tax virtually
is confiscatory. As a large part
of the oil supply for the British
naval forces comes from Mexico
anv interruption of tiie output
would be a serious obstacle in the
conduct of the war .teaiflst the
Central Powers. Consequently
both the United States and Great
Britain regard the decree as a
subject for diplomatic handling
in view of the report that Mexican
.olficials are determined to en
force it immediately.
Ambassador- Fletcher at Mexico
Citv is understood to have includ
ed this subject in the list of pend
ing questions requiring adjust
ment before there can be an
agreement between the two gov
ernments for a freer exchange of
foodstuffs and other commodities
which Mexico needs.
The new tax is levied against
land owners who operate their
own properties and upon all rent
als or leases and- royalties paii
by those developing the land.
Upon leases amounting to five
pesos a year per hectare approx
imately acres the tax is 10
per cent, leases from five to ten
pesos per year, twenty per cent
and leases exceeding ten pesos a
year, fifty per cent.
Most leases are made on a
rental and ? royalty basis and in
addition to taxes cn rental fifty
p?r cent of all royalties must be
raid, either in money or oil as
tbe department of finance may
determine. Heavier tixps also
are imposed on the land owners.

WASHINGTON, March S Troop
and supplies for General Pershins's
forces now are moving to France on
scheduled time, it was learned today
on high authority. While figures mar
not be published, it was stated posi
tively that transportation requirements
cf the army are being met by the ship

ships was declared to be satisfactory!
It Is felt strongly that the opening
of major operations in what President
Wilson has predicted will prove the
decisive offensive of the grent war
will not be mucn longer delayed.
In Flanders indications this year are.
that the ground will harden early in
spring permitting either side to und
ertake the enterprises planned.
In previous years April has seen of
fensive operations set in mction by the
allies. For that reason many officers
here seem to anticipate raiding ana
minor assaults before the middle o
next month which will show in them
selves that the ground is being
mapped, useful knowledge obtained
and local strategic advantages estab
lished by one side or the other in pre

FIGHT THE KAISER NOW !
Bisbee has a Woodrow Wilson club and
a Citizens Non-partisan league, both organ
ized Tuesday night and each having iden
tical purpose the highest possible manner
of support of President Wilson and the na
tional government.
Both organizations are, in effect, politi
cal, the non-partisan league's purpose be
ing to put a non-partisan ticket in the city
primaries and election, and to elect it; the
Woodrow Wilscn club to further the
principles of the democratic party in sup
port of the present national administration.
To get the effective results which it is the
aim of each to obtain in support of the
government, both should work together.
The non-partisan league's non - partisan
ticket in the city election should . also be
of the Woodrow Wilson club.
During the war period we have no time
for petty local political strife cf any kind.
The emergencies of the hour demand that
as good, loyal citizens we get together and
stay together in every community. This
is not possible if we let petty politics and
ambitions slip in to take our attention frcm
the main object standing . together as a
solid unit for the best effort in local govern
ment, good government, that we can pro
duce in aid of the general government.
Concerted " action is what we need as
a nation, and every little helps in this
matter, just as every little helps in our Red
Cross, war loan and other war-time eii
deavcrs. We have no time for, and should have
no patience with, any other course than that
of standing together harmoniously. We
can do all the politics we want to after the
war, as we did before. But during the war,
cut out such interference with local unani
mity. Leave the fighting among our
selves to another day, uniting now in fight
ing the kaiser.
Pick the best available men frcm both
parties, as the non-partisan meeting of
Tuesday night sought to do, and then sup
port them unanimously, regardle33 of
whether you like some of the individuals or
not. Let the only point be whether they
are men who deliver results. Every man
on the non-partisan ticket bears that stamp
not one of them but is and always has
been a result getter in the conduct of his
affairsin this camp.
CORRECTING CHILD DIET.
If the war does no more for the United
States than outline and introduce in the
country a plan for the rearing of more
healthy men and women, if it brings heme
to the people of this nation the lesson that
children must have balanced rations as well
a3 balanced sleep, balanced education and.
balanced play it will have accomplished a
great end. Investigation of men of the draft
age has disclosed one of the chief causes for
physical' defects in mal-nutrition of the
youths cf the nation.
Steps toward the correction of this evil
have already been taken in many parts of
the country. The studies of the United
States public health service have shown
that school children, more especially of the
poorer communities, suffer frcm lack of
correct nutrition. The noon-day meal is
sometimes entirely eliminated. Frequent
ly it consists of the wrong character of
food. The result has been, says the health
service, that early mal-nutrition has reflect- j
i . if .1 ,,t i
ca itseit in the grown man to a marked de
gree. Now the health service is considering a
national program of co-operation with state,
county and municipal" authorities for the
purpose cf safeguarding the health of chil
dren. Properly balanced school luncheons
furnished at the schools at cost, or below
cost, they have discovered will tend largely
to promote health and development
in the southwest has brought to the atten
tion of the service schools at El Paso, Texas.
Here, hot, nutritious meals are served the
children for one cent and richest and poorest
are served alike for the single maximum and
minimum charge. With short trial, the
plan has proved itself strikingly effective
and happier, healthier, more satisfied chil
dren have resulted.
THAT FOOD PROBLEM.
.The nation's surplus of polatoes is now
estimated at more than 100,000,000
bushels. The canners of the country have
been advised by the United States food ad
ministration to hold for war purposes "such
quantities of canned corn, peas, tomatoes,
string beans and salmon as they may have
on hand."
The result of tieing up the produce of the
canneries of the nation can result in one
thing only an advance in the price of these
goods on the wholesale and retail market.
The surplus of potatoes will not last They
will spoil with time. Their presence on the
market has effected the price but slightly.
For efficiency, why dcesn't the govern
ment buy the potatoes and evaporate them ?
They would largely take the place cf
canned goods now withheld from the mar
ket. The soldiers like potatoes as well as
bread. Germany is living principally on
evaporated potatoes, and they are excel
lent food.
"The food administration is charged with
the duty of helping to provide our army and
navy and our associates in the war with
these goods," says the announcement to
the canners.
But, evaporated potatoes are more nu
tritious, better food than canned peas,
string beans and salmon, and their evapor
ation would be little trouble with no waste.
Prices in canned goods have advanced al
ready far enough. A little aleviation now
would be welcomed by the entire nation.
THRIFT STAMPS BUY '
You, Mr. Citizen, and every other man,
woman and child in the United States is
called on by Uncle Sam to purchase before
the end of this year, your share of war sav
ings and thrift stamps. Your share is $20,
for the year. When you have subscribed to
that amount, you have your full quota. But
there is nothing to prohibit your purchas
ing more than a full quota-not until you
have $ 1 000 worth, when the government
says you shall buy no more.
But each little stairjp you buy has a ,
purchasing power for the soldier in France
or preparing to leave for France. Each day.
when you have an extra quarter, or half
dollar, and you purchase one, or two, or
four stamps, you are aiding just so much in
equipping the army. Here is what the lit
tle stamps represent in commercial value
to the United States, in fighting value to
the soldier, and in comfort, equipment and
munitions :
One little thrift stamp will buy a tent
pole, or five tent pins, a waist belt or hat
cord, shoe laces" or identification card.
Two thrift stamps will buy one trench
tool or a pair of woolen eloves. '
Four, thrift stamps will buy two pairs of
canvass leggins. .
Six thrift stamps will buy five pairs of
woolen socks or three suits of summer und
erwear. Twelve thrift stamps will buy a steel hel
met. Sixteen thsift stamps and a small addi
tional sum will buy one war-savings stamp,
and war-savings stamps will purchase as
follows :
One war-savings stamp will buy one

LOU JACOBS RETURNS
WITH MUSICAL JAZZ
Lou Jacobs is back in town and it ;
eeins somewhat like the old days for
he has brought a show that went over
ar the Orpheum last night with a 1
runch and a riot of "Jazz" that sent ,
tue patrons away saying all kinds of '
nice things. '.
The offering last night was "For-1
ward. March." it might Just as well !
l ave been named "The Goose Step
Dackwards," for when It comes to
musical comedy there is nothing In a j
rame. There is much though in the
way Jacobs produced the Bhow and the ;
way his song birds put it over.
Vou may be prejudiced against a
large chorus girl but when they line
up in such an array of beauty and put
the pep into their work, you simply
Lave to love them. Jacobs has the
best looking chorus ever brought to
Lis bee.
The principles could easily get by
in a $1.50 or $2.00 attraction and the
"iazz" orchestra is a feature that sim
ply brought the audience to their feet.
There are sonu beautiful song num
bers in "Forward March" and the cos
tumes are most dainty and fetching.
The bill will be lepeated tonight and
tomorrow night the bill will be chang
ed to one of the late New York non
sensical oddities, "Watch Your Step."

JUDGMENT WAS AFFIRMED.
The supreme court of Arizona has
affirmed the decision of the lower
court in the case of the superior and
Pittsburgh Mining company, appel
lant, against Steve . Davidovitch or
Steve Davis, appellee, from Cochise
county. The appellee had secured a
verdict for $10,000 against the appel
lant for personal injury, involving the
loss of an eye. After tfca trial. th
defendant moved for a new trial oa
the ground of newly discovered .'vi
dence that Davidovltch had been blind
of one eye before the accident in
which he claimed to have been injur
ed. The lower court, inquiring into
this evidence did not find it suffi
ciently convincing and denied the no
tion. The judgm-ent of the lower
court was affirmed.
