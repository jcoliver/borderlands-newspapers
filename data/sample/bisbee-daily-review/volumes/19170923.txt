ULTIMATUM
T BERLIN
DEMANDING
RETRACTION
Argentine Asks Germany to
Disavow Actions of Lux-
burg and to Reaffirm Its
Former Promise to Respect
Ships.
(By Review Leased Wire.)
BUENOS AIRES. Sept. 22. The Ar
gentine government has sent an ulti
matum to Germany.
In its note the government demands
for a' formal statement from the Ger
man government of its attitude to
ward the behaviour of its minister,
Count von Luxburg and a repetition
of the promises made respecting Ar
gentine shipping, in connection with
the Toro settlement.
No Message Received.
The Argentina government has re
ceived no official messages from Ger
many since the disclosures by the
American secretary of state except a
verbal statement by an undersecre
tary of the foreign office made througH
Dr. Molina, Argentina's representa-j
tive at Berlin.
Foreign Minister Speaks.
The Argentina foreign minister
made a statement in, the chamber of
deputies tonight regarding the situa
tion and it was said the radicals had
prepared a resolution which they In
tended to introduce, declaring a state
of war already exists with Germany.
Waits On Berlin.
The government is awaiting anx
iously Berlin's response before decid
ing on a rupture of relations or a
declaration of war, and according to
the foreign office, if the German gov
ernment shows appreciation of Count
von Luxburgs action Argentina will
consider it an insult and declare war
immediately. If no confirmation of
this report is forthcoming, only a rup
ture of relations is likely.
Would Shake Cabinet.
A declaration of war would result
in a shakeup in the cabinet, several
of the ministers maintaining no cause
for zr exists, although a majority of
the ministers and the public generally
are willing to follow the government
even Into war. A great mass meeting
was held todaj adnt here was a unan
imous call for an immediate break
with Germany.
Tie foreign minister told the depu
ties the Argentina government was
translating 400 telegrams sent by the
Sweden legation, many of which were
transmitted for the German legation.
Heated Is Debate.
A heated debate on the question of
whether to declare war or only to sev
er relations continued in the chamber
until midnight. The discussion was
full of excitement at times and two
deputies challenged each other to a
dueL
Chill Approves.
SANTIAGO. Chili, Sept. 22. The
Chilean, papers are discussing the vote
in the Argentina senate relative to a
ruptin; with Germany. They charac
terize as disloyal and impolite Count
von Luxburg's conduct, and fined jus
tification for te attitude of the senate
In their view, the Argentina's senate
action indicates that solidarity ought
to exist among the American nations
for the defense of their dignity and
honor.
GERMAN DESTRUCTION.
(By Review Leased Wire.)
PARIS, Sept. 22. The newspaper
Les Nouvelles of Maastricht an
nounces that 25 per cent of the Ger
man garrisoning Belgium have been
recalled, the German authorities pro
posing to nse these "blind, maimed
and halt" for the creation of new units
for the fighting front.
It adds that the Germans' have de
stroyed the famous Cockerill steel
plant near Liege. Several other plants
have been destroyed and it is said the
same fate awaits all Belgian factories.
MITCHELL ASKS RECOUNT.
(By Review Leased Wire.)
NEW YORK, Sejt. 22. Mayor
Mitchell tonight made legal applica
tion for a recount of the ballots cast
in the mayoralty primary election
Wednesday. He announced his ac
tion was taken to settle any doubt ai
to his nomination. Revised returns
show that the mayor has a majority
of 595 votes over William M. Bennett
for the republican nomination.
Mine Operator
Explains Wages
Under New Price
"The understanding as tJ wages
readied between the government
and coper producers is that the
rate of wages paid for the month
of August will be maintained while
the price of copper is fixed at 234
cents. In cases where sliding
scale contracts are in force, the
sliding scale will not be carried
down when the wages under it
would be fixed at below the Au
gust rate. In all cases where ad
vance in wages tiver the August
rate have been since granted, such
increase mus; be maintained."
Walter Douglas.
Much comment has been heard on
the streets of the Warren district re
garding the effect the fixing of a price
for copper would havet on wages here
and elsewhere. This, in spite of the
fact that the dispatches carried the
infotraation that the producers had
agreed to maintain the wage scale in
effect at the time of fixing 'of the price
for the metal.
In the Warren district, where wages
are the highest of any copper camp in
the world, the miner for the next four
months will be assured of a wage of
$5.35; muckers and carmen will re
ceive, under the same arrangement,
$5.10 a day.
As Mr. Douglas inferred In tne
quoted statehent, the producers of cop
per metal in the United States, in or
der to do their share for the govern
ment and for the cause, Iield wages
at a point higher than their contracts,
based on the sliding scale of c'opper,
really called for.
LINE TO PIECES
Russians Are Forced to Retire
To the Eastern Bank of the
Dvina. Operation Will
Mean Little for Invader.
(By Review Leased Wire.)
In the midst of Russia's internal
troubles has come another German
s-troke on the Russian northern front,
resvting in the capture of the bridge
head and town of Jocobstadt, on the
Dv.ua. and the enforced retirement: of
the Russians to the eastern bark of
the liver.
Gain Much Area.
The Germans gained possession of
new territory on a front of approxi
mately 25 miles and six miles in depth,
enabling them to jfhsh their lines to
the west bank or the Dvina in this
area. They took only 400 prisoners,
but gathered in 50 guns from the
abandoned positions.
Dramatic as this suddenly developed
operation waB, it seems unlikely to de
velop anything comparing in import
ance in its effect upon the general
military situation with- the desperate
battle on the Flanders front.
Germans Hard Hit
Loath to give up the valuable ridges
the British wrested from the niThurs
day, the Germans continue desperate
counter-attacks. This figthing has
been very disastrous to the Germans.
The German command Beems parti
cularly reluctant to surrender the
slight elevation west of Gheluvelt,
close to the Ypres-Menin road. Fierce
fighting developed there Saturday, the
engagement centering about the posi
tion known as Tower Hamlet
Struggle Continues.
Press dispatches indicated that up
to mid-afternoon there had been no
cessation of the struggle, the tide of
battle flowing back and forth within
a narrow area.
Berlin's Modest Claims.
Berlin's official statement makes
no claim of any ground recovered
from the British. It records the fight
ing of Friday, the day following the
initial British dash, as marked by con
tinuation of British attacks along the-Langemarck-Hollebeke
front, which
were repulsed, describes Saturday's
engagements as fighting of a local
character which resulte din German
successes.
Ottend Attacked.
Meanwhile, as a complement to the
land fighting in Belgium the warships
of the Belgian coast petrol have bom
barded Ostend where German naval
works were shelled with results pro
nounced satisfactory. British aviar
tors continued their extensive bomb
ing operations behind the German
lines, Ostend being one of the points
successfully attacked by the aviators
as well as the fleet.

Unless Pope Again Seeks to
Bring up the Question the
U. S. and Allies Will Not
Consider Such Proposals.
(Bv Review Leasea Wire
WASHINGTON, Sept. 22. Thare
wlii be no turther discussion of peace
at this time by the United States and
the entente allies unless i is forced
by a Iresh appeal fro mPcp Benedict.
This wa sclearly indicated both at
the state department aui by allied
diplomats today, after publication of
the unofficial texts of the replies of
Germany and Austria to the papal ap-
peal. There was nothing unexpected
in either response, although the Aua-
trlan note aroused some interest be
cause of its apparent sincerity.
May Try Again.
Officials believe that, heartened by
the replies of the central powers, the
pope will make a fresh attempt to
bring the belligerents together at the
peace table. If he does, it was indi
cated that, while his note would re
ceive courteous consideration, it
would strike no responsive chord un
less referring directly to the points
involved In President Wilson's reply
to -the first communication from the
Vatican.
Austria Sick of War.
Notwithstanding the apparent sin
cerity of Austria's reply, some diplo
mats held the opinion that Germany
was responsible to a large measure
for its character. Many government
officials, however, think Austria's re-
WITH
OR
sponse was the cry of a governnutinftuS.Lled on tne tlL'r(' Hot his Inten-
sickened by war and perhaps indicat
ed a growing spirit of revolt against
German domination.
Using Austria.
Those who held Germany was re
sponsible for Austria's attitude point
out that it was not inipossiblet hat
Germany herself, wearied and weak
ened, was using Austria to force fur
ther the wedge of peace while she
stood in the background to gain some
advantage as might come to the "not
too eager to yield."
SUB ACTIVITIES
MINIMIZED BY
MANYDEVICES
Admiral Benson Reports that
Loss to Vessels is Less than
One-half of One Per Cent
At Present.
(By Review Leased Wire.)
WASHINGTON, Sept. 22. UnTes:
some new outbreak of submarine ac-j
tivity developes, many officials are
satisfied the situation is fairly well
under control. Encouraging result
have been obtained convoying of
fleets of merchant craft, the loss hav
ing been reduced to less than one. half
of one per cent. The employment of
smoke screens, kite balloons and oth
er detection device's also has shown
good results and" progress is being
made with the reduction of smoke
from merchant men by painting ships
to make them almost invisible at a
tance through a periscope.
More Publicity.
In discussing submarines today, Ad
miral Benson, acting secretary in the
absence of Secretary Dapiels, indicat
ed the department's intention to make
known more of its accomplishments
hereafter than in the past.
Admiral Benson said the depart
ment had been unable to find any sup
port for reports that German subma
rines either had begun operations off
the American coast or were preparing
to do bo. t The department, however,
is ready for any emergency.
The "Smoke Pot"
The "smoke pot" a device to throw
a screen over a vessel wnen a suoma
rine appears, has been highly success
ful in some cases.
Experimenting continues with many
other devices. Thomas A. Edison is
still at work on Investigation to which
he devoted himself at the outbreak of
the war.
SENATE HIGH
COURT FINDS
IN FAVOR OF
TEN CHARGES
Impeachment of Governor
Ferguson of Texas Appears
Assured. Eleven of Charg
es Fails to be Apporved.
(By Review Leased Wire)
AUSTIN, Texas. Sept. 22. Governor
James E. Ferguson today was im
peached by the state senate, which
sustained ten of the 21 rharees in the
j biI1 of impeachment returned by the
lower bouse committee of the whole.
One Enough.,
The vote on the first article that
he usea $5,500 of state funds to settle
a personal obligation was sufficient
to convict A two-thirds vote was
i necessary. The ballot was: ayes, 21;
noes, 4.
Next Tuesday at noon, the senate
formally will pronounce its judgment.
Conviction carries with it. It is under
stood, disbarment from future offices,
but this condition possibly will be am
eliorated. Hobby Is Governor.
Tonight the governor is severed
from the position to which he was
twice elected. Acting Governor Will
iam P. Hobby, an editor of Beaumont,
assumes the full power of office. Hi?
tenure w-ill extend to January, 1919.
Ferguson said he did not know
what his future plans will be. It Is
probable that he will go to bis ranch
for a rest.
Ferguson Cheerful.
Mr. Ferguson received his defeat
cheerfully. He joined in the laughter
when his old friend and supporter,
Senator I. E. Clark, stubbornly an-
tion to vote "no on each of the twen
ty-one charges.
To friends who surrounded him
when the last article had been dispos
ed of he said:
"Everything will be all right."
Four For Acquittal.
Senators Clark, Hall, Parr and
Woodward ' stuck? with the governor
from start to finish. But on the votes
counted, those on the most serious
charges against him, they alone were
with him. The rest of the court vot
ed solidly to uphold the charges pre
ferred by the house board of manag
ers.
Speaks For Himself.
Governor Ferguson this morning J
went before the senate high court and
argued that he be acquitted of the
charges against him.
Comparing himself to "Daniel In the
Lion's Den. fighting for his life." Gov
ernor Ferguson today staged his last
great effort to clear himself of the im
peachment charges against him.
For two hours he faced the senate
high court and throng of spectators
and pleaded for acquittal. When the
governor concluded, recess was taken
until 10:30 p. m.
The Sustained Charges.
Article one charging misappropria
tion of $5,500 of Canyon City normal
funds was sustained 27 to 4.
The second charge that the gover
nor profited from the deposits from
Canyon City normal funds was sus
tained 26 to 5. The third article,
charging that Governor Ferguson tes
tified that he did not owe the Temple
State Bank any money, when as a
matter of fact he had transferred his
notes to the Houston National bank
temporarily was not sustained, IS to
13.
The fourth article, that the trans
fer of the notes to the Houston Na
tional Exchange bank did not relieve
him of responsibility for them was not
sustained, 18 to 13.
The fifth charge, that the governor
told the March investigating commit
tee he had no debts in the Temple
State Bank when, as a 'matter of fact,
he owed the bank $11,200, was not sus
tained, the vote being 14 to 17.
On the sixth article charging the
governor derived a profit from state
funds deposited in the Temple Stale
Bank, the senate voted to convist, 24
to 7.
Article seven, charging that the
governor assisted in depositing $250,
000 of state funds in the Temple Stat?
Bank for profit was sustained, 26 to 5.
Article eight, that the governor
sought to have state highway funds
deposited in Temple bank for profit
was not sustained, 9 to 22.
The ninth article, that the gover
nor deposited funds in the Temple
Bank that could have been placed in
the treasury was not sustained, 15 to

CARDINAL IS
CRITICAL ON
WILSON PLAN
TO END WARS
Gasparri, Papal Secretary of
State, Says President's Sug
gestion Is Dream. Would
Abolish Conscription.
(By Review Lease Wire)
ROME. Sept. 22. The reply of the
entente allies to the peace note of
Pope Benedict now is being awaited
by the Vatican, after which the pope
will again address a note to all the
belligerents. The pontiff will point
out that the questions on which all
agree really represent the beginning
of a new order of 'bings in the world
and a new era cf peace for humanity.
The secondary problems, he will say,
can be adjusted easily a.id better
through good will and friendly dis
cussion than by force of arms.
Gasparri Indicates Views.
It is understood the next papal note
virtually will embody the views ex
pressed by Cardinal Gasparri, the
papal secretary of states, to the As
sociated Press today In commenting
upon the situation after the publica
tion of the reply of the central empires
to the pope's note.
Wilson's Proposal a Dream.
"President Wilson's proposal to re
duce armaments and impose interna
tional arbitration by force through a
society of nations' is a dream," said
Cardinal Gasparri. "An international
army to force the verdicts of the court
of arbitration? In which country
would it be located without being in
fluenced by local politics and preju
dices? The moon is the only place
possible.
Suppress Conscription.
"AH the other inconvenieces and ob
jections could be avoided by suppress
ing conscription with the provision
that it could not be re-established
without a law approved by the peo
ple, which in normal conditions would
be imprbable, indeed morally impossi
ble. To this some would object that
certain governments first would de
clare and then present a bill to parlla-j
lucm lur me nuuyuuu ut vuubuiiiuuu
and the formation of a large standing
army, which parliament undoubtedly
would pass from patriotic motives. All
this would be pissible, but it would
be difficult as such a government first
would have to violate a treaty signed

WASHINGTON. Sept. 22. con
ferees on the war tax bill today
agreed on Vine of their chief points of
dispute in considering war excess prof
its taxation the definition of invested
capital and then struck a serious ob
stacle in bouse demands for drastic tax
increases, which threatened tonight to
result in final disagreement.
A Sunday session of the conferees
t'j settle minor points was arranged.
Compromise Definition
A compromise definition of invested
capital, said to provide a system of
allowance for borrowed funds and also
intangible assets was aproved by the
conferees.
Want Great Increases
Discussion W exemptions and grad
uated taxes rates, however, developed
the demand of house representatives
for radical increases of the senate
rates and a much greater levy on war
profits. It was understood the house
members insist upon adding between
$250,000,000 and $500,000,000 to the
$1,060,000,000 senate levy.
May Withstand Demands
Senate conferees were reported to
have expressed fear that a higher to

would impair business, and agreed to
withstand the house demands, even to
reporting final disagreement
House conferees were understood to
feel that the house membership is

Active During
Flanders Battle
(By Review Leased Wire.)
LONDON, Sept; 22. The official
statement from British headquarters
tonight reads:
"During the day heavy fighting has
again again taken place south of the
Ypres-Menin road. The enemy fought
with great determination but without
success to regain possenssol of Tower
Hamlets ridge. Three strong counter,
attacks north of Tower Halets were
completely repulsed by the "Durham
troops.
Raid Is Broken Up.
"A raid attempted by the enemy
early this morning in the neighbor
hood of the Arras-Cambrai road was
prevented from developming by our
fire. We carried out a successful raid
east of Monchy-le-Preux and captured
a few prisoners, without loss to our
troops.
Great Air Activity.
"Aerial officials: On September 21
the weather improved, causing greater
aerial activity. A great deal of suc
cessful work was done with aerial,
our airplanes and balloons ranging
the guns on hostile batteries, troops
in the trenches, shell holes and other
targets. Our flying machines continu

Bombing also continued. Four tons
were dropped by our airplanes on
enemy airdromes and billets in the
vicinity of Lille, and alrdormes south

OBJECTOF VISIT
Viscout Reading In This
Country to Align all of the
Allied Nations in a Great

(By Review Leased Wire.)
WASHINGTON. Sept 22. Ameri
can and British officials are working
on a program providing for closer eco
nomic co-operation with a view t'j
uniting for war purposes the entire
resources of this, country and Great
Britain and her possessions.
As confidential agent of the British
government Viscount Reading, ford
chief justice of England, is handling
negotiations here. While tremendous
in its scope. Lord Reading's mission
here is only a part of the comprehen
sive structure of unity of resources
which Great Britain is building. The
resources of all her dominations and
of all the allies to be formed, so far
as possible, in a compact whole, from
which all the allies may draw.
One purpose of Lord Reading's mis
sion is to ascertain what supplies this
country may furnish the allies.
Indications are the allies will re
quest a volume of materials bounded
only by America's ability to produce
and the trans-Atlantic transportation
facilities.
A detail of the program under con
sideration is the manufacture on a
huge scale of munitions here for the
allies.
The munitions requirement, how
ever, form but a small part of the to
tal. Coal, copper, iron and steel, food
stuffs and clothing are needed in tre
mendous volume.
DISCUSSION IN BERNE.
BERNE. Sept. 22. The heralded
discussion of the American embargo
began today in parliament when Pres
ident Scbultheis. answering an inter
polation on the increased cost of food
stuffs and their increasing scarcity,
said that war rationing changes im
perilling Swiss economic life had tak
en place on the entry o fthe United
States into the war.
The president gave a summary 8f

COOPERATION
FIGHTING OF
SEVERE SORT
RAW NEAR
MENIN ROAD
Germans Attempt Counter At
tacks In Order to Win Back
Lost Ground. British Beat
Back Thrusts of Foe.
(By Review Leased Wire.)
WITH THE BRITISH ARMIES IN
FRANCE AND BELGU'M, Sept. ZZ.
(By Associated Press.) Hard fighting
developed during the night at various
points along the front of the new Brit
ish offensive east of Ypres as a result
of several heavy counter-attacks by
the Germans. But while ."ocal battles
are still continuing, the enemy was
thrown back in most places with se
vere losses.
Situation Unchanged
Generally speaking, the situation re
mained unchanged. One of the heav
iest counter-attacks made by the Ger
mans was west of Gravenstafel ridge,
about a mile and a half north of the
Ypres-Roulois railway. The enemy
surged forward from an elevation in
mass formation and hurled themselves
against the British along a front of
nearly a mile. It is reported that the
Germans advanced under a white flag,
and If they did they were fully re
warded for their treachery, for tn.,
repulsed with very heavy losses.
Assault Determined
The assault here was most deter
mined and- sanguinary fighting fol
lowed. At one' point the rushing en
emy penetrated the British line for a
distance of a fifth of a mile, but was
quickly driven out at the point of the
bayonet, and the whole .attacking
force was compelled to retreat leav
ing the ground strewn with dead and
wounded.
Another small encounter which the
enemy attempted in an adjacent sec
tor was broken by artillery fire before
the Germans came even in contact
with the British infantry.
Other Counter-Attacks
Shortly after 8 o'clock last night
the Germans launched strong counter
attacks on a mile and a half front
stride the Ypres-Menin road, along the
British defenses east of Inverness
Copse and Dumbaton Lakes. The
fighting here was severe, and at latest
reports was still raging on the risht
in the neighborhood of Tower Ham
lets, which have been the scene of
almost continuous strift since the of
fensive began. On the left of this at
tack the British line was reported in
tact but no news bad been received
about the situation on the right up to
the time of the sending of this dis
patch. East of Langemarck
A hostile counter-attack east of
Langemarck was shattered by the
British artillery, and in the same sec
tion the British improved their posi
tions in the neighborhood or Shuler
farm. When the advance began on
Thursday the British purposely push
ed by on both sides of a oerman re
rtrtnht at Schuler farm and left it in a
pocket.
This was because of the marshy na
ture of the ground around it which
made infantry work difficult.
Gain Foothold
At one point the Germans succeeded
in gaining a foothold, forcing the Brit
ish to retire. The position is of minor
importance and will have little effect
on the present situation as a whole.
Outside of this !"ocal battle, things are
comparatively quiet along the front of
the new offensive at the latest re
ports. Artillery Effective
Evidence continues to accumulate
showing the tremendous effect of the
British artillery work before the open
ing M the offensive. One German of
ficer, taken prisoner, who had fouijht
on all the fronts and participated in
the battle at Arras, declared that the
British bombardment during the twenty-four
hours prior to the attack was
the grea-.est he had ever experienced.
The Germans appear to have suffer
ed heavy casualties rrom gas as wen
as from ordinary shell fire. One drum
mer captured Thursday said that two
battalions in his regiment were in
process of relieving when the British
gas came on them. Twenty men out
of fifty in his command were gassed.
and more in proportion In other com
panies. The majority of the men af
fected died. The gas was highly con
centrated and the men could not get
their masks on in time. The drum

That Make Higher-Priced Garments Envious
THE WHISPER OF CHANGE that rumors the dawn of
a new style is first heard at "THE FAIR" The shifting
scenes, in the mirror of Fashion, are sharply outlined in the
Salons of Style on our Second Floor. The new Garments,
the new Accessories, and the new ways To Wear them, are
most authentic if you have seen and heard about them at this popular Women's Garment Store.

small amount will do when expended in our garment department.
SUITS COATS FROCKS $25.00, $27.50 AND $29.50
Silk Underskirts $335
Re-priced for Monday
WOMEN WHO are most familiar with present
market conditions, the scarcity of silks, and their
consequently advancing cost, will need no urging
to take advantage of this opportunity to secure a
silk underskirt for less than its real value.
These are made of soft quality heavy Taffeta,
in a full range of the wanted plain colors, as well
as changeable effects; deep flounces that are
pleated or ruffled. These are a THIRD under
value at Monday's sale price $3.35.
NEW SWEATERS
For Women, Misses and Children
WISE, INDEED the woman, or mother who
buys Wool Sweaters Now. For everyone knows
that it is hard to tell when Wool Sweaters will
be lower priced present indications are that they
will be much higher as the season advances.
Our Fall lines are here, for women. Misses and
children they were ordered many months ago,
which makes it possible for us to price them to
you at much below" their present market value.
We were never better prepared to serve your
needs for Sweaters and those who choose now,
will make a substantial saving.
WOMEN'S SWEATERS FROM $5 to $12.50
MISSES' and GIRLS' SWEATERS, $2.50 to 7.53
INFANTS & CHILDREN'S SWEAT'RS 1.50 to 3.50
SEE THEM Proud as peacocks, they are and
not one whit abashed in the presence of garments
that cost much more.
It really does one tood to look at such an assembl
age of garments at the moderate prices we've at
tached to them When one reads so much and hears
so much of "HIGH COSTS" and "ADVANCING
PRICES" and the scarcity of everything. Come,
see the savings you can make.
FOR IN TRUTH the materials in thU season's
garments that we've marked $25.00. $27.50 and $29.50
positively seem richer, colorings lovelier, styles more
alluring and the garments actually more wearable
and more wantable in every way than those of prev

We know Bisbee women are going to have even
greater regard for a department that can furnish
such garments, at such prices, under prevailing conditions.

1009 SLACKERS MAR
There are more than 1,000 slackers
in Arizona.
While no definite figures were avail
able Friday in ihe office of Col. Fred
S. Breen, directly in charge of the
draft work in this state, he announced
f ervat;ve estimates of th enumber of
men who have failed to respond to the
summons of local boards.
A large per cent of these slackers
are Mexican and other alien residents,
it was pointed out. In many instances,
these men have failed to report be
cause of their misunderstanding, of
the draft regulations. It is believed
that not more than 15 or 20 per cent
of the total number of slackers are
Americans.
The number of deserters in the state
is approximately 250, according to thfc
announcement Friday morning. Men
of this classification are subject tc
court martial, and upon conviction, to
the death penalty.

OF MARSHALL, TEX.,
26 POUNDS
Popular Young Railroad Man
Says Hs Has Found Out
From Experience What
Tanlac WiU Do.
"When I finished taking my third
bo:tle jf Tanlac nearly three years
ago, I had entire relief from nry rheu
matism and found that I had actually
gained twenty-six pounds in weight be
sides. 1 threw my crutches away and
went to work, and I have he'd my
weight and have been well ever
since."
The abov remarkable statement
was made to the Tanlac representa
tive in Marvin's Pharmacy a few days
ago by Harry L. Knight of Marshall,
Texas. Mr. Marshall has for a num
ber of years been connected with the
bridge building department of the
Texas Pacific railroad and was always
at his post of duty until he became
so disabled by the rheumatism that
he was forced Vo stop work and seek
relief. Mr. Knight is a nephew of
former Adjutant General A. J. Scott,
who was formely of Atlanta, Ga., but
now of Tioga. Texas, and he has many
friends, especially anftng railroad peo
ple, in this section of the "Lone Star
State."
Continuing his statement, Mr.
Knight said: "Yes, sir, I have found
out value of Tanlac by taking it my
self. I certainly appreciate what It
did for me and I'm glad to make this
statement and give others the benefit
'of my experience With what I consider
the best and most useful medicine yei
discovered.
"Three years ago I was taken with
what is called articular rheumatism In
a very severe form. I was laid up
with it and remained in a hospital at
Marshall for three weeks. I got no
relief and had about given up. I just
suffered as much as a mortal could,
it seemed to me, and no treatment or
medicine gave me any relief. I had
intense pain in the joints of my lower
limbs and my feet were so swollen I
couldn't wear my shoes. I had to use
crutches and even then it was agony
for me to navigate. I lost twenty
pounds in weight and was badly run
down. I. was extremely nervVms and
this made my suffering worse, as my
pain was principally in my swollen
joints, and it was torture for me to
move about at all.
"Well. I read about Tanlac in the
Dallas News and decided to give it a
trial. I just began to improve on my
first L'-tt'.e. and. as I have already
said, when I finished my third bottle
I was entirely relieved, threw away
my crutches and went back to my old
ioh with the railroad. I picked up
twenty-six pounds, which was six
pounds nore than I had lost. I have

Sunday Morning, September 23, 1917.
They do say that Edison has Invented a device that de
flects torpedoes from a thip. Almost too good to be true.
But passengers upon a liner recently in port from Liver
pool, declare that a torpedo headed straight for the side
of the big ship was deflected and thrown up out of the
water in a most extraordinary manner. The Edison lab
oratories neither deny or affirm. Here's hoping!
Misfortunes hardest to bear never happen, declared
an old philosopher, and he was right. Take the case
of the Russians. Just as we begin; to give up all hope
for them, after a disgraceful and cowardly retreat, they
brace up and fight back with warlike determination.
Every time we begin to prepare for the worst, which is
to say, a separate peace between Russia and the Hun,
the blamed Russians fear back and growl at Wilhelm
and continue to occupy his armies on the eastern front.
After the fall of Riga it looked as though Petrograd
would go next. But Instead we find the Russians fight
ing fiercely in the north and far to the southward.
Chief Three Bears of the Yellowstone Park reservation,
speaking for the "onehundred and one tribes," has ap
pealed to the Great WMte Father at Washington to allow
them to guard the Mexican border while the troops now
stationed there be sent to France. In a .most remarkable
and eloquent message, this chief says: "Fifty thousand
men who know the horse as no white man ever knew It;
50,000 Indians who, when their hearts are in a cause, as
our hearts are in this cause, would die for it as no other
nation. Mr. Secretary of War, call us to arms! Let us
guard and fight for our country. We stand ready to pro
tect the 1,400 miles of border between the United States
and Mexico, and we promise you that not an aliCn foot
shall cross that border to pillage br destroy. We beg of
you to give us the chance to fight."
A "dimmer court has been established in Los Angeles
that specialties in cases against autoists who violate the
state law regulating headlights on their cars. It is a
good court and its work most beneficial in the preserva
tion of life njsd property. Such a court is needed in the
Warren District and 3uch a law is needed In Arizona.
There is probably no more dangerous, crowded, crooked,
narrow tboroughlare in the world than the one from
Bisbee to Warren. With ditches on either side, or moun
tain walls, and with only room for cars to scrape past each
other, a dazzling, glaring, blinding pair of headlights are
as dangerous to life as a crazy man with a loaded gun. A
few Cochise autoists have dimmers on their cars. To meet
one is a pleasure. One bows in the dark to these good
Samaritans of the road. But the large majority hurl
their Gila monster headlight cars at high speed down the
canyon like dragons seeking whom they may destroy.
You American mothers who have given a son and you
wives who have given a husband to the war, and think
the burden of fear is greater than you can bear, listen o
this story of sacrifice by an English mother: Mrs. A. Mo
Gill, a widow of Croydon, near London, has given ten
sons to fight for their country. Of these six have been
wounded, one taken prisoner and one discharged on ac
count of illness. Three of her sons are officers, two
non commissioned officers and one has won a medal for
bravery. Ye gods, what a woman! Mot.'ior of heroes,
daughter of the empire. Firm must have been her hand
and great her soul to have rocked such cradles. Her
cottr.ge with its rose covered porch Is a shrine. Ten
soldiers have passed through the gate of that little Eng
lish garden to enter the terrible trenches of France. Ten
brave 1 men, ( each in a different regiment. Imagine, if
you can,' that mother's feelings when the dispatches an
nounce a fresh offensive. Six have come back through
that garden gate, carried back to rest and recover from
their vounds. One will never come back. And the
worst of the war vet to come.
SUNDAY MORNING SERMON.
"Jehovah, make me to know mine end
And the measure of my days, what it is;
Let me know how frail I am."
Psalms 39:4.
All the noted characters of the Old Testament, except
David the Psalmist, were so austere, so devout, so stern,
so exalted, so inspired, in their words and ways anion?
men that it is hard to judge them by mortal standards.
Moses, the prophet and leader, walked In majesty all his
days, and in death he was more majestic and mysterious
still. If he ever had any of the 'iti.e faults and failings
of mankind his writings did not betray them, nor did any
other chronicler of H0I7 Writ set them down. Aaron,
his brother prophet, was also singularly free from the
errors and follies of the flesh. And so was Joshua,
Samuel, Elijah and all the other forty prophets of the
school at Ramah. Saul, first king of Israel, was grand,
gloomy and peculiar. Solomon was written of only as
being most wise, majestft and rich.
And so it is we are always in awe of these stern, great
old personages and afraid to even conjecture as to their
possible weakness and little sins. Theirs was the straight
and hard path. Our poor weak feet falter at its close
confines and steepness.
But David the shepherd boy, king, warrior and singer,
ah, he was the glorious, rinful, sainted, shining hero of
the older of the two Great Books that go to make thj
Only Book. Somehow he seems to have been of the
same clay and same passions and impulses and hopes and
fears and strength and weakness of the simple pilgrims
who walk this mortal path today.
He is first pictured to us as a yellow haired, blue eyed
boy without a speck of majesty or austere saintliness.
Just a regular boy with his harp and sling and shepherd's
crook. Even after he slew Goliath and became a na
tional hero it did not seem to affect his boyish simplicity
and modest demeanor. His love for Jonathan Is one ot
the sweetest stories ever told. As a king he was still
the same David, simple, kindly, affectionate; absolutely
devoid of affectation. He walked and talked and had his
being more like the men of today than any other biblical
character.
And this same David sinned most grievously. Thi
most gifted of men and the most devout, he was also
the most sinful. The weakness of the flesh was his,
and also the weakness of the spirit before temptation.
His humility and his sincere repentance saved htm.
Most of his Psalms are devoted to petitions to Jehovah
to forgive him his sins. . He had experienced all the
grandeur and grief, the luck and losses and the best and
worst of life. He had ascended to the heights and de
scended to the depths, and then with his seat firm upon
his throne and his crown fixed serenly upon his head, he
called aloud to Jehovah to make him know the end and
measure of his days. He prayed that his, frailty he
shown to him, and not his strength and his glory. "
That was the finest thing about David. He retaime-J
the modesty and simplicity of his shepherd bearing all the
days of his kingship. He was the humblest and the
meekest great man this world has ever known except the
Nazarene.
We have a little good fortune; our small talents and
weak efforts are rewarded with wealth; the multitude
applaud us, and straightway we become swollen with
pride and haughtiness takes hold 'upon us. Instead of
calling to the Master to measure the handbreath of our
days, we become possessed with the wild and foolish idea
that we are going to live upon this earth a thousand years
at least we act that way. We devote our ways to busi
ness and our words to fame. We pile our gains up ii
shining piles and add to our parasangs of land and build
our houses as high as the tower of Babel was intended
to go. '
It Is not of our frailty, our weakness, our mortality,
that we think, rather it :s of our power and invincibility.
And then comes "a flash of the lightning, a break of the
wave," and we cower before the majesty of the Master
and are greatly afraid.
It Is too late, then. Better be like David, who asked
about the measure of hU life and prayed to be told how
frail he was while He was yet in- the zenith of his glory.
It counts for something then. The cry of fear wrung from
a selfish heart is not to be heard in the skies, but th?
man who folds about him the golden mantle of his
earthly fame with meek hands and lifts his eyes towards
heaven and calls in contrite tones to ask to be told how
frail he is, that man will be heard from the Great Whit"
Throne to the farthest glory kissed rim of the Dclcctabk'
Isles.
"France demands the return of Alsace and Lorraine."
This is the frank and heroic declaration of the French
premier recently made in the chamber of deputies. And
all the world except the Central powers applaud this
brave stand. French land, French blood. Taken by a
conquerer in order that the fester of war might never
heal. Taken upon the demand of the German people
and against the advice of the great Bismarck and the
wishes of the present kaiser's father. The most sacred
and glorious traditions of France hover over the land of
iost Provinces. Joan of Arc, the Maid of Orleans who
save France came from lxrraine. She is the bravest
and most wonderful figure that has ever appeared upon
the screen of history. Her I'ttle village of Droniremy is
the heart of Prance. And the gentle, kindly, thrifty Al
satians are part and parcel of the Gallic heritam-e from
Clovis, the first kjng of Gaul. Germany has never stated
a specific peace condition, with all her whining for peace.
France, England. America have all spoken out plainly '
and greatly and in the voice of all humanity as to the j
only possible peace to whiJh they will submit at the red I
end ruthless hand of the Prussian autocrat. I

A tall, red-eyed young man walked

started down the aisle on his mission.
But he soon forgot what he was go
ing after. He baa never been in tne
Phelps Dodge store before, md he
was "seeing' things."
A pleasant looking' woman stood be
hind a counter sorting boxes of hand
kerchiefs. The young man addressed
her.
"Nice looking handkerchiefs,? ha
said.
"They're mighty nice handkerchiets,
too," was her reply.
"May I examine 'em?" the young
man asked.
"Certainly," came the response.
"They are something we have Just
gotten in. and we think they're really
most attractive. See, they are hand
embroidered Irish linens, and Irish
hand-embroidered."
"And I'll wager," said the young
man, "that the lady who is selling 'em
is Irish, too!"
"She is; and her name is Miss Keat
ing," smiled the pleasant looking wom
an, never dreaming that she had given
herself away to a newspaper man!
And Knitting, Too!
Upstairs three lit;le girls sat knit
ting under the direction of another
pleasant looking woman. By subtle
hints, the newspaper man discovered
that her name was Mrs. E. D. Yenmy.
"Sort of a kindergarten knitting
class?" he asked.
"Yes," she said, "that is, on Satur
days. Saturday afternoon I teach all
of the children who care to come down
how to knit and how to crochet. The
rest of the week I have classes foi
women from 1 until 5 o'clock. In ad
dition I teach them the Red Cross
system of knitting, and to crochet
any particular design that they care
to work on."
Advertising Mr. Hickson.
The young man was getting interest-
wear department and enagged Miss
Hoban In conversation.
"Occasionally I read "'Vogue,' " he
stated, "and I see where the eastern
women will wear nothing but Hick
son models this far west; do they?"
Miss Hoban looked at the young man
reprovingly. "We keep not only
abreast of the east, but occosionally
a little ahead of it," she announced.
"That gown of prune-colored velvet
behind you happens to b ea Hickson
model, while I can show you Hickson
models in almost everything tailored
that women wear. Here, for exampje,
is something very new and very smart
in a street dress. Notice the tendency
toward the military lines." and she
exhibited a stunning creation in navy j
blue stitched in red, and bearing red
buttons. "These," Miss Hoban then
produced a garpe-amethyst afternoon
gown and a peach colored evening
dress with a silver net hung over the j
bodice, and with the hem edged in
which are popular in the east ttt
now, and which are equally popular ;
in Arizona."
The young man gasped. He was
ever his depth. "I guess I had better
be goin," he remarked helplessly.
"All right," said Miss Hoban cheer
fully.. But first come over here and
see what's new in fur. People are,

This particular piece is of Dudson seal
The shoulder piece, as you see, is
wide and long scarfe. Both the scarfs
and muff are lined with 'nigger crepe

And Hats.
Walking toward the stairs, the
young man noticed the new hats,
"What's the smartest things in head

Vance.
"Black beaver sailors," she said,
"in addition to turbans of burnt goose,
Then purple hats, Chenille hats and

And Other Things.
As he was leaving the store, the
young man walked to the eastern win
dow and looked for a long time at the
exhibit there. It contained brown vcl
vets, brown satins, brown Georgette
crepes .and brown broadcloths from
different mills; and they matched per
fectly. In addition, there were shoeJ,
hosiery and gloves; all of the same
color.
The young man turned and walked
away. He had forgotten all about his
original purpose in entering the store.
He had forgotten all about the time-
he had spent there when he should
have been doing something else. In
fuct, he had forgotten everything save
that he wished he had been born a
girl. After all, 'tis pleasant to write
about beautiful handkerchiefs and
beautiful furs and beautiful dresses
and beautiful hats and beautiful
gowns; but it isn't half as pleasant
as being able to wear 'em!

MRS. W.H.BRDPHY IS
NAMED AS MEMBER
OF
Prominent Local Woman Se
lected for Important Posi
tion In American Defense
Society. Work Is Outlined.
Mrs. W. II. Bropliy of Bisbee has
been named by the committee at
Washington as a member of the
American Defense Society. It is a
high hon'jr, and also entails much la
bor and responsibility. She will serve
lor this section upon the Woman's
National committee of this great or
ganization, and will undertake exactly
the same work here that Mrs. Robert
leasing and Mrs. Theot.Vre Roosevelt
and scores of other able and patriotic
women are doing in their states
throughout the east and north.
The first task for this new member
of the Defense Society from Cochise
is 'outlined in the following statement
from the New York bureau:
"The first thing you can Co is to
concern yourself with the desperate
activities of the German empire in
this country. Some of these activities
are political; others are attempts at
dynamiting our war plants, spreatrng

um of peace talk or infecting our pt
ple through deadly germs sold, tr giv

"If you are an American citizen, if
you believe in the ideal of life, liberty
and happiness for which our fore
fathers gave their lives in the Revolu
tion ; if you are not at the front then
it is high time that you aid in patri
otic American wrk at home by en
rolling in an organization like the
American Defense society, which is
made up of citizens who, without
thought of personal gain, are giving
their time, enthusiasm and money to
the cause 'of American liberty."
Big Patriotic Carnival
It is proposed to hold during the
month of October a series of theater
parties, carnivals, fairs, garden par
ties, etc., throughout the country, and
in this behalf Mrs. Brophy has been
asked to serve with Mrs. J. W. Har

NEW YORK. Sept. 22. Supreme
Court Justice Daniel F. Cohalan of
this city tonight issued a statement
in reply to a reference to him con
tained in the exposure by the commi
tee on public information at Washing'
ton in regard to the eGrman propa
ganda and plots in this country prior
to the break in diplomatic relations.
His statement said in part:
Didn't Know Von Igel
"How much England has had to do
with the publication of the unsigned
statement of an unnamed third party
of my alleged view, 1 do not kn'ow.
But I do not know and I cannot under
stand how my name was connected
with any papers ot Mr. von Igel, as I
never met or knew him, and nevei
beard of his existence until the time
of his arrest I never sent or request
ed the sending of the remarks which
are attributed fj me."
Viereck Has Alibi
George Sylvester Viereck, editor of
Viereck's American Weekly, which he
called the Fatherland before the
United States went to war with Ger
many, disclaimed all knowledge of the
entries contained in the exposure on
German propaganda. His statement
says in part:
Disclaims Any Knowledge
'I have not the faintest idea what
entries referred to In Von Igers pa
pers mean. Berore our country de
clared war I received hundreds of let
ters from many sources offering inven-
ions for sale to the German govern
ment. I may have received offers to
sell quantities of picric acid. I know
nothing abont bombs except In the
snhere of metaphysics. I turned all
such inquiries over to the German em
bassy.
America First
The legality of the munitions trade
has been established by our govern
ment . My action, therefore, Implies
no discredit to me. Between the
United States and Germany there
could be only one choice for me. The
motto in my weekly is my own also:
'America first and America only.' But
I don't surrender the right of free
speech. Criticism is not merely a
civic right, but a civic duty. I did not
wish America to go to war, but now
that the country is in It, I hope she
will come out of It with honor the
sooner the better."

in conjunction with all civilized na
tions. Then it would not always be
possible to induce parliament to vote
large military appropriations."
Economic Boycott.
"Under conditions we propose, the
nation attempting to violate a treaty
with the civilized world would be lm
mediately threatened by a general ec
onomic, commercial and financial boy
cott. Only a mad government would
run such a risk.
Disarmament Follows.
"The suppression of conscription
would lead automatically and without
any disturbance of public order to dis
armament, namely, to the end of mili
tarism, bringing beneficial conse
quences for international peace and
also the restoration of economic and
financial conditions in the countries
exhausted by the present war.
Vatican Against Policy.
"The Holy See always has opposed
conscription. We always refused to
introduce it In our own army, when
the pope was a temporal soverign.
Kngland and the United States are
the most splendid examples of how
great powers can exist without stand
ing armies, but even these two coun
tries, despite their colossal resources,
once war was declared, required a
long time before being able to form
a large army. If all states were in
the same condition during the time
necessary to prepare weapons such a
long period would elapse as to render
it possible for friendly intervention
with a view to avoiding contlict.
Advocates Referendum.
"Finally, the whole world, in addi
tion to the suppression of obligatory
military service, should proclaim the
principle that no head o fa state .eith
er emperor or king, or the president
of a republic should have the right
to declare war without first consult
ing the people, preferably through a
referendum or -Ji liNst through thf.
parliament .
Cardinal Gasparri concluded:

of victor and vanquished, no question

Peace Talk.
The complete text of the German
and Austrian replies to the papal
peace note shows that neither lays
own any definite terms as the basis
for peace. There was no officially
expressed comment in Washington,
but it was said that no expression
would be made as the documents re-
ealed no reason for alteration of the
position of the United States, its aims
or Its intentions.
An official expression from the
British foreign office pointed to the 1
ac of any mention of "restoration" j
or "restoration" in the German reply.

ident Wilson is easily over come as

In reply to Governor Campbell's re
quest that the mining companies of
the state try as far as possible to give
Arizona credit for the full amount of
the second issue of liberty bonds, the
Calumet and Arizona Mining company
of this district has informed the gov
ernor that the next purchase of those
bonds by the company would be whol
ly credited to Arizona. The reply to
Governor Campbell was sent by Gen
eral Manager Green way after he had
conferred with the other officials ot
the company. j
The imminence of a call by the pres-!
ident and secretary of the treasury for 1
renewed subscriptions to the Red '
Cross and liberty loan, respectively,
moved Governor Campbell, early in j
August, to address a letter to the gen-1
eral managers of the larger mining !
corporations throughout Arizona, In !
which he set forth that many of these
companies have offices in New York j
and other cities outside of Arizona. j
The subscriptions to the two causes
mentioned, while very large in the ag-:
gregate, were so distributed as to fa- j
vorably affect the pro rata fixed for i
other states In which many of these i
companies have central offices and i
distributing headquarters, and Cover- j
nor Cambpell foresaw that the second
call would occasion a serious drain up-1
on the resources of many small busi- j
ness organizations and individuals in I
moderate circumstances, which would i
make it more difficult to collect the j
pro rata of Arizona than In the case 1
of the first call. j
If other companies of magnitude will
respond In equally generous terms, the '
work incident upon the collection of':
Arizona's shares will be largely minimized.

unsettled at the close by a renewed

Peace talk played a part in the
course of the market. Bethlehem
Steel sold down nearly 5 points. The
other steel shares also howed weak

the outstanding feature being the bet

NEW YORK, Eept 22. As a result
of overnight developments, peace sen
timent seems to have gained headway,
and this was reflected In a willingness
on the part of holders in the so-called
war ahares to reduce commitments.
Weakness was most conspicious in
that type of securities and of course
imparled declining tendencies to other
departments except in the case of
rails, where light gains were record
ed. Expectations of reassuring advices
from Washington regarding the eco
nomic situation and expectations of
a rather liberal price fixing policy
to be adopted by the adimnistration
in regard to the steel products were
subordinated as market factors to the
peace tolk, that is constantly making
Its nraaonxa fait
It now looks as though we are V
a period where as far as fluctuations
are concerned, there will be many
cross currents and the tendency dic
tated by the international political
developments. Though on the whole
some moderate betterment would not
be surprising in anticipation of the
successful flotation of the next in
stallment of the liberty loan.

THE SWEDISH ELECTIONS.
STOCKHOLM. (Correspondence
of The Associated Tress.) The great
political event of this year in Sweden:
Is the general election for the cham
ber, which, lasts from September 1
to September 21. elections being ton
iO.uc.iea in
deliberate and leisurely
i fashion in this country. The main is
sues are the questions of universal
suffrage for all citizens over 21 years
old. Including women, and the foreign
economic policy of the government.
In the latter respect, the existing gov
ernment is being attacked by liberals
and social democrats, although all
parties are solid for neutrality.
A eignificent feature of the three
last general elections .has been the
squeezing out of the liberal party by
the conservatives and social demo
crats, and probably this will be more
marked this year. The best-informed
newsoaners predict slight socialist
gains. The socialists probably will bo
the strongest of the three parties In
the chamber, but It is doubtful wheth
er tbey will be strong enough to form
a government. The result is likely to
be a coalition of some kind.
Liberals condemn the economic pol
icy of the government on the ground
that it has not done Its utmost to pre
vent the exportation of necessities.
The present government's main
argument for its continuance Is that
the presence of M. Branting in a lib
erasocialist government would be
viewed with suspicion in Germany.
The present government is not ex
pect to resign even in the face of a
considerable adverse showing at the
polls, and even a hostile vote in the
inew chamber, which meets January
"il5, might not force resignation, as
I the senate will continue heavily con
ies i nerval ive and a vote of both houses
is required to compel the dismissal of
the ministry.
WOMEN "ROUGH IT" IN FRANCE.
LONDON. Five American women.
five French women, and 10 English
women, who volunteered for farm
work with the national land council,
have been sent for a month to "rough
if as fruit pickers in the orchards
about 20 miles from London. They
live in' a barn and work from eight in
the morning to six at night. The fruit
is all hand picked from iong ladders
and the work is not easy.
They get eight cents an hour, th
same as the regular fruit pickers who
come Into the fruit district each year
from the East End of London and who
sleep in freight cars along the sid
ings. The big upper floor of their barn
dormitory is curtained off into 20 com
partments where the girla sleep on
straw. They board themselves; each
has her own teapot and dishes, and
prepares her own breakfast and lunch
eon. Dinner they have together, as
sessing themselves 14 cents each to
cover the cost of the material, while
one of their number, chosen in turn,
is called the "orderly of the day," and
stays in to prepare the dinner, which
usually consists of a stew, suet pud
ding, bread and syrup or Jam.
Their working costumes are of vor
iou8 types, each according to the
wearer's fancy. One American girl
designed and made for herself a uni-
form consisting of ritlng breeches,
gaiters, a riding coat and a slouch hat.
The French girls affect blouses and
knickerbockers. One of the English
women has a remarkable head dress
picked up years ago in an Italian vil
lage. SILVER IN ISLANDS.
MANILA. Philippine Islands, Sept.
22. Increased business in the Philip
pinesfl coupled with the rise in the
price of silver has made bullion in
pesos worth 15 per cent above par to
day, has caused a scarcity of silver
coin. Chinese merchants are discount
ing currency.
IDEA ABANDONED.
.AMSTERDAM, Sept. 22. The Ber
lin correspondent of the Rheinische
WestfaUsche Zeitung of Tssen, leans
from an "especially well informed
quarter," that the German government
has abandoned the idea of giving Alsace-Lorraine
the status of an inde
pendent federal state.
Experience the Best Teacher
It Is generally admitted that experi
ence is the best teacher, but should
we not make use of the experience of
others as well as our own? The ex
perience of a thousand persons is more
to be depended upon than that of one
Individual. Many thousands of per
sons have used Chamberlain's Cough
Remedy for coughs and colds with the
best results, which shows it to be a
thoiOughly reliable preparation for
those diseases. Try it. It is prompt
and effectual and pleasant to take.

sufficiently long to reach to a little above the
knees; many others to a little below. Some,
however, are of uneven lengths being shorter
in front than at the sides and back. The skirts
are designed to conform to them, being simple
instead of elaborate in design.
Materials most popularly used are Velours,
Broadcloths, Serges, etc. Furs constitute the
principal trimmings. One very popular suit is
tailored Silvertone, a very beautiful material,
others are strictly tailored models.

The New Styles in Waists for
Fall and Winter, 1917-1918
One feature of the new Fall season is
the showing of what might be called suit
waists waists in shades to match the
prevailing colors in suits; if not exactly
matching the suits the waist may be se
lected to attractive contrasting tones.
On this account colors in Navy, Russi
an, Green, Battleship Grey, Khaki, Bur
gundy and Brown promise to have good
run on public favor. Waists portraj'
ing these shades, when speckled with
dashes of bright trimmings, scintellat
ing beads, or silk in embroidery, present
to the eye creations of sombre loveli
ness that are rare indeed. Come, see,
and examine the other little things about
them that we have not space enough to
elaborate on here.

THE BISBEE DAILY REVIEW, SUNDAY MORNING, SEPTEMBER 23, 1917.
PRICE FIVE CENTS
MINES, MINING, LOCAL STOCKS AND COPPER
Fifteen Millions
Will Be Spent By
Mining Operators
Calumet and Arizona Completes Big Ore Drift From Cole
Country to the Central Hoisting shaft Work Uncovers
Several Fine Bunches of Ore. Smelters at Douglas Run
ning Normal Globe Works Gradually Resuming.
Fifteen million dollars will not cover the cost of new underground fa
cilities which mining companies of the state have brought to completion this
year, or will finish before the end of December. Some of this work has been
under way upwards of. two years.
The Calumet & Arizona, in this district, provides, probably, the most no
table single instance of big work brought to completion thus far in the year.
It is found in the long haulage drift from the Colo shaft area for the de
livery of its ores by electric tram and which Is now In operation, after more
than two years of work. It is a strong link in the efficiency chain which
C. & A. operating heads have worked out tor me conuuct oi uiiuergrounu
mining and development divisions, with a manner of thoroughness and suc
cess that is not exceeded In any of the great mines of the world, and to which
extensions are constantly being made. While money, labor and engineering
skill put upon the Colo drift connection represent a large aggregate, the re
turns in higher efficiency and lower costs will well repay all of the expendi
ture. Since the drift was started there have been, too, findings of new ore
resources in Colo area, not unexpected by the mining division, but neverthe
less unattained at the time of beginning the drift, that greatly add to the
working value of the haulage way. Nor has the development, big as it is,
of this area as yet near reached its climax.
Electric Pump Starts.
Another enterprise of large importance is in the C. & A. mechanical de
partment, where they are just starting up the electric pump in the junction
shaft. Installation of this pump was in some part experimental, and that
stage is not yet entirely concluded, but has advanced to a point where com
plete success seems assured". The pump installed required much figuring of
intricate character, for the amount of work called for exceeded, that to which
attention had been previously asked from electric pump manufacturers in
association with mine requirements. It will send the water from the 1800
level to the surface and has a capacity of 1500 gallons the minute. The to
tal junction pumping requirement is at this time 3200 gallons the minute.
Under recently completed connections, this junction pumps are handling all
of the water of the producing mines of the district with exception of the
Czar's copper water, which goes through the Copper Queen, precipitation
plant. Success of the electric pump will mean that the steam pumps will
be replaced with electric design in the junction. In such event a no small
gain will be made in doing away with the steam pumps which are now of
necessity carried to the bottom of the shaft, with unwelcome contribution
of heat to the mine.
In each of the large copper producing districts of the state there is more
or less of this general manner of underground improvements continually go
ing on. It comes to be looked upon as routine, yet it requires unremitting
study, tremendous expenditures and the continuous employment of large
forces of skilled underground men on work which pays its profit only after
years of operation.
Smelter Active.
. The great smelters of the Copper Queen and the Calumet & Arizona min
ing companies have been able to continue this month at normal capacity.
There have been no departments closed down and ore in the bedding plants
has been sufficient at all times to meet needs. Shipments from the mines
continue to be such as to warrant the expectation that the month will con
clude as satisfactorily as it has thus far gone.
From Globe it is learned that the International smelter fired up its first
reverberatory the end of last week, and that it is now going very satisfactor
ily. Miami, Inspiration and some Old Dominion ores are going (o the plant.

Oatman, Ariz., Sept. 22. New de
velopment work is receiving an im
petus recently which has resulted in
greatly accelerated activity. The Ar
izona Moss Batk Mines company has
completed its organization and taken
over the Moss Back property. Work
has already been fitarted preparatory
to sinking the shaft from the 330-foot
to the 530-foot level.
The new company is fully financed
to do the work as well as to build
a mill, if the showing warrants such
a proceeding. Charles W. Maier of
Chicago, is president of the company;
Allen Paull of Wheeling. W. Va.. is
vice president; M. W. Kemperly, sec
retary and treasurer; Will H. Hoi
comb of Los Angeles, organized the
company.- He is also heavily inter
ested in Mexican mining properties.

three shifts put on again at the com

news the camp has had for several
months. The further announcement
that the vein of ore that has been
opened up in the Butter Nut mine
at the 200-foot level, is 50 feet wice

mining men here. It is stated that

carrying good values, but the com

financial difficulties, and the property

spring the mine was unwatered by
the present owners and the showing
found there was so pleasing that they
have paid off the indebtedness and

Mayer, Ariz., Sept. 22 The Arizona
Binghempton Copper company has
completed a month's run with, the
first and second units of the new
flotation mill at the mine, five miles
east of this place. New work on the
600-toot level has encountered exten
sions of the large shoots of copper
that are being stoped on the 400-foot
level. The ore is a chalcopyrite with
some tetrabedrite and iron pyrite in
the Yavapai schist.
Senator W. H. Reynolds of New
York, and a number of the stockhold
ers of the United Verde and United
Verde Extension companies, are in
terested in the company. The find
ing of ore on the 600-foot level proves
the permanency of this mining dis
trict which is only 18 miles soutn
of Jerome, on the same strike.
The Copper Queen company, of
Paris, Texas, has an adjoining mine,
which is being extensively developed
on the 300-foot level in. two shifts.
Twenty-five thousand tons of milling
ore have been blocked out. The com
pany plans building a flotation mill
at the mine.
The Big Ledge Copper company, of
Duluth, has announced that work will
be resumed at the smelter in Mayer
on October 1. The plant is to be en
larged with the 6econd smelter, one
reverberatory and two converters,
which will give a total capacity of
about 1,000 tons. The plant will be
completed about January 1. The com
pany will put on three shifts at its
two principal mines, the Butter Nut
and Henrietta, two miles from Mayer,
on October 1. By the time the smel
ter is ready for ore, both properties
will be developed to supply the full
capacity. The main ore body in the
liutter Nut mine has developed into
one of the largest shoots of milling
ore in the state. At the 200-foot level
it is 50 feet wide, a chalcopyrite ore,
which can be cheaply handled by flo
tation. The company plans install
ing a flotation mill at the mine for
a large capacity. A wire tram has
been purchased to carry the ore from
the mine to the railroad, half a mile
distant. The Big Ledge Copper com
pany has recently purchased the
Great Western Smelter, which Is a
consolidation of the two companies.
The resumption of work on such a
large wale by this company means
to make a permanent camp of Mayer.
It is the plan of the company to en
courage the development of mining
prospects in this vicinity by afford
ing a market for custom ores.

THE WESTERN VULCANFING SHOP
Johnson Addition, Lowell, Ariz.
Three of the largest and richest
mines in the state of Durango, Mex
ico, heavy producers of copper matte
and gold and silver bullion in the
past, will be reopened,, more than
3,000 Mexican laborers will be given
employment in mines and smelting
plants, and one of the richest mining
districts in northern Mexico will be
revived, if plans and negotiations now
being carried on by American own
ers of the mines and El Paso consuls
materialize. The negotiations had
reached an advanced stage Thursday
night and it is considered certain that
the mines will be reopened inside the
next month.
The three mines, located in the
Magistral districts near the small min
ing towns of El Oro and Inde. are the
properties of the National Mines &
Smelting company, the Guadalupe
Mining company, and the Inde Gold
mining company. Officials of all three
properties are now in El Paso cbn
ferring with Consul General G. M. Se
guin and other Mexican officials. They
have presented their plans for reop
ening, the plans having been approved!
and negotiations are now being car
ried on to complete the pact where
by the companies will operate under
a guarantee of military protection.
To Have Protection.
According to the plans submitted,
the mining companies request of the!
Mexican government the stationing at I
the mines of a force of soldiers large!
enough to guarantee peace. If such
a force is provided, declare the min-i
ing companies, they will start work!
at once, will employ at least 3,000 1
Mexican laborers and miners, and will j
combine to work the mines and pro
duce matte and bullion as long as J
they have peace. A large train of;
motor trucks from the mines at El!
Oro and Inde will be Installed to carry
the matte and bullion from the mines;
to Hermanas, the nearest railroad sta
tion, and to carry supplies from the
plants.
Thinks Mine May Reopen.
Consul General Seguin, in an effort
to guarantee the mining companies :
the protection which they are asking,!
wired General Francisco Murgia, corn-
mander of the government forces in '
Chihuahua, advising him of the mines' j
proposition. He received in reply (
from the Mexican general at Chihua- i
hua City, Thursday evening, a tele-i
gram in which General Murgia stated
that inasmuch as the district of Mag
istral is in the state of Durango and j
therefore outside his military juris
diction, he has wired the secretary!
of war, at Mexico City, submitting the !
request of the mining companies and
asking for instructions in the matter. I
"I am sure." declared the consul j
general, "that the request for pro-i
tection will be granted and that thej
mines will be reopened under protec-'
tion of federal troops. General Ama-j
ro, commander of the government!
Silver Forges Ahead. j
The fullness with which copper has
occupied the center of the stage in 1
mining interest in Arizona during re- j
cent years has prevented the momen-1
turn In silver interest that has been '
attained in some other of the old sil
ver states, but silver is nevertheless I
coming to the front by leaps and '
bounds from border to border of thei
copper state. j
Chloride District Active. '
Properties carrying silver are in
demand under any manner of attain
able arrangement. They are wanted
under lease, bond and option or on '
direct purchase terms. Hundreds of ;
prospectors and miners have turned !
their attention wholly to silver in j
the last few months, and notably since !
August 1, when the real unlift in the
price set In. Copper operators will
find part explanation in this fact of;
the shortage of labor reported from '
all the copper districts, for many of
their miners have bustled not only :
to silver districts in this state, but
to those of every other western state, j
Chloride has received many of them,'
and some are already engaged in prof- j
itable leasing operations. The latter
opportunity at this time in the Chto- i
ride district, however, is practically;
cleaned up, for every old-time prop-j
erty is operating under the manage- j
ment of owners or leasers. The ac-j
tivity prevalent is the greatest in the ',
history of the district, with indica-j
tions favoring the output of more I
metal in 1918 than in any previous
year.
Silver A By-Product
While Chloride and contiguous ter
ritory will perhaps be the largest sin
gle producer of silver in Arizona this
year, the by-product of silver from
the ores of the large copper produc
ers of the state will much exceed the
total output of the white metal by
mines in which it predominates. The
bulk of Arizona's silver production
last year came from copper ores and
it is known that the copper miner
are now turning more attention to
the extraction of silver bearing cop
per rock than ever before. Endeavor
along this line will hardly become ap
preciable in results until in the first i
part of next year. With labor condi-
tions such in 191S that efficiency can!
be attained, there will be no doubt
about Arizona lifting the total of its i
silver output in no less sensational
degree, proportionately, than it has
advanced its copper output since 1914.
While silver mining in the state may,
not produce near the value of reve-;
nue for the federal treasury under!
the piotit tax for war purposes that;
copper does, the increased mining of
the metal will provide a no insignifi
cant additional sum for federal, state ;
and county treasuries, which, added
to the enormous revenues derived
from taxes on copper profits should '
put the state high up in the ranks
of those leading in volume of contri-,
butions to war and general tax funds. .

stinct, a kindly-hearted, loose-limbed
man, with shoulders broad as a door,
ready to bear any burden, and legs
willing to the last pace of the most
gruelling march. Gahey was an Irish
man and a soldier second to none.
Once one of his mates was asked:
"What kind of a fellow is this Ga
hey?" "Ole Gahey!" he replied. "He's
one of the best pals a man could have.
He would give you the very sugar
from his tea!"
"What kind of a fighter Is her was
the next question.
"Fighter! God, you should see him!"
was the answer, and the man's tone
and the expression on his face spoke
volumes. Gahey was indeed a great j
fighter, a handy man with bayonet and I
bomo. No raid in which his battal-l
ion took part was perfect without him.
To see him standing on the parapet of:
the enemy trench, his bayonet glint-)
ing as a flaring star-shell lit up thej
conflict, and to hear his loud laugh
and louder voice echoing through thej
night were a tonic to his mates and a(
terror to his foes. His ringing tone
as he shouted: "Clear thim out o' it,
my buckos, clear thim out o' it," be-
fore throwing a bomb into a dugout,:
was something to be remembered.!
And little Charlie Sader (comedian on
the London stage before he took upi
realistic work on the more serious j
stage where war's tragedy has a long
season.- remembered Gahey's words
when giving a performance in a con-;
cert behind the lines. Charlie imper-j
sonated Gahey flinging a bonfb on a;
German dug-out and shouted out in a
brogue that could be cut with a blunt
hachet: "Clear them .out o' it, my:
buckos; clear them out o' it" All the(
audience yelled with delight and thej
man who yelled loudest was Gahey,!
D. C. M.
One night a week later, found Ga
hey again on a German parapet. When
with his accustomed exhortation he
had flung a bomb on the German dug
out, he turned round to his mates.
"Is Charlie Sader here?" he asked.
"I'm here, Gahey," came the answer.
"Well I hope ye've made a note iv
what I've said." Gahey remarked.
"There's money in it after the war,
and you and me'll go half and half in
the profits."

ti, nmuKivA rhara'-tpr of the C, T-
man defence works is well shown in
the two photographs which illustrate
the formidable nature of the obstacles
that the allied trt'ops on the wen' err.
fron: have to overcome. A British
coriespoadeut writvs: "The wiioie ic-
mans launched an attack against a
trench in which Gahey's battalion was
stationed. The Britishers went out to
give battle in the open. Gahey had a
hard fifteen minutes with his favorite
weapon, the bayonet, and he gloried
in the job. Suddenly he came to a
dead stop, when a young German, a
boy of 17 or 18 rushed at him and
tried to run him through. Gahey
waited until the steel almost touched
his khaki, then he stepped quietly
aside, reached out with a long arm,
caught the German by the coat collar
and gave him a gentle slap over his
hindmost parts after the manner of
an irate mother reprimanding her
child.
"Away back with ye behind our
lines, ye little vagabond," said Gahey.
"Away back and be made a prisoner!
Sendin' you out to fight! Your mother
should have more sense. . . Now
be a good little boy and do as I tell
ye. Go back and be made a prison
er!" Gahey had a thirst which he never
could properly assuage despite his
earnest endeavors to humor it.
"The thirst' wan put into me the
day that I first saw light," he often re
marked. "Drouth alwaj-s comes be
fore drinking, and I'm not responsible
for the drouth. . Some people like wa
ter and some don't. I'm one of thim
that has no love for water. If God
sent barley and hops He didn't send it
for no purpose; He sent it for the
use of men like me. Then there's the
Bible, and what does it say? What
but this: 'Take a little wine for the
stomach's sake.' I saw it down in
black and white with me own two
eyes."
Considering that Gahey spoke in
this strain it is not surprising that he
liked his rest-billet to be near an es
taminet. Being a man who could car
ry his liquor as a gentleman should,
he was never seen the worse for
drink.
Gahey, in addition to his profession
al qualities, was noted in his battalion
as a keen and successful collector of
souvenirs. Officers and men going
home on leave generally bring s6uv
enirs with them to meet the demand
of their relations and friends. In the
battle area, leave, when it comes,
may find the departing soldier without
a souvenir, and, of course, he wants to
take something home with him; but in
nine cases out of ten he cannot get a
souvenir at that particular moment
for love or money. It was a different
story in Gahey's regiment, for he was
always in possessian of a stock o?
souverirs, consisting of such things as
German helmets, knives, belts, and
damaged bayonets. These were the
by products of many a night's raid and
and reconnoissance, collected with un
failing zest and a keen eye for the
rarer kinds of curio.
He carried a little black clay pipe,
"the best I ever sr.w in Ireland or out
of it," as he often said. When going
out on his nightly prowls he left his
pipe with a mate, telling him to treat
it tenderly until he came back. He
loved his pipe more than his life.
He is still alive, for like the prover
bial cat he is in possession of nine
lives. He fears nothing and nobody.
Gahey, D. C. M, a hero of Mons, is a
worldly soul.

Just a couple or quiet, rather goou ;
looking young fellows, they are, typi
cal perhaps of the best in Young j
America. They haven't been in the
department very long and some of j
their fellow workers haven't been s
quite sure in their estimates of them.
Cut the Old Sage of the department,
the chap whose judgment of each new
come has always been alike unspar
ing and unfailing, rendered his opin
ion soon after they came.
'They're boys w ith a lot of stuff," ; j
he said. j
The verdict of the Old Sage was cor- j
rect. The two young fellows have
proved beyond any doubt or refutation
that they are "boys wUn a lot of
stuff." For the both of them joined
Uncle Sam's aviation corps. Very
quietly, without any swagger or boast-
ing .they went down and tcok their
examinations for entrance into the i
"suicide squad." Safe for the present j
from the draft, they disdained to take
advantage of the chanca to enjoy the
comforts of civilian life. And with
equal disdain they refused to pick out
a soft snap in the army or navy, such
as their education might enable them
to obtain.
They have chosen instead the Great
Adventure. Pioneers they are, the
blood brothers of they of whom Kip-
line wrote"
Came the whisper, came the vision,

It seems queer, hard to believe, that
it is the quiet, earnest young chaps
like these who are to be the heroes
of the tomorrow that is now so near.
Yet from among the like of these are
to come the Thaws, the Lufburys, the
Norman Halls of the red summer of
1918.
They know that the odds against
them are big; that death in new and
strange and awful forms will claim
many of their kind. But unafraid, de
precating both praise and sympathy,
they are going forth into the Great
Adventure. Men who write of the
deeds of the tomorrow will crown
their names with epic phrases, but to
day they are still the quiet, unassum
ing young fellows with whom we have
associated in shop and offic-e. Only
now, for the first time, we know them
for what they art "boys with a lot
of stuff."

(By WALT MASON.)
Thrice is he armed, the sages say, who hath his quarrel just;
thrice armed, therefore, is Uncle S..m, who's out to win or bust. For
never since the world began has nalion gone to fight with nobler pur
poses in view, with rause more truly right. We covet not a perch or
rood of any foreign soil, no treasure chests of friend or foe do we de
sire to spoil. We were not hunting for a scrap, peace was our end
and aim, we heaved a sigh of true resret when v.e broke in the game.
We sighed in pity when we saw the old earth painted red. we suffered
wrong with patient hearts, and laid away our dead. But patience can
not always last, nor pity still endure, when wrong is heaped on bitter
wrong; such ills the sword must care. And so we took our harness
down, and strapped it on our breast, and reached for claymore, helm
and lance, r.nd trusty arbalest. And now the fateful die is thrown,
and crimson war shall last, till autocrats and lords of war are relics
of the past. And ever as wc pot ;he foe, and bag the kaiser men,
true inspiration shall we find, agrrin, and yet again, in that great
truth the sages wrote in volumes filmed with dust: "Thrice is he arm
ed," so runs t!;e rede, "who hath l:u quarrel jujt."

his dream later, but that he prophe-;
hook to Mr. Slosson's "Major Proph
ets of Today." Mr. Slosson quotes
this much of the poem:
its roots take hold in hell;
Xo peace or praise can heal it,
Cut a Ftranger heals it well.
JSeas t-hall be red as sunsets.
And the kings' bones float on foam, ;
And heaven be dark with vultures,
The night our son comes home. '
Few persons foresaw in 1905 when
this poem was written that the "Seas
'shall Ik? red as sunsets" and thai the
two gr at Saxon nations should broth-
ers be in the world's supreme clash
of arms. And. as Mr. Slossons points
out, Chesterton lost faith and repu
diated his prophecy in these words:
"I have come to see that our hope.--of
brotherhood with America are the
same jn kind as our hopes of broth
erlicoi! with any other of the great
independent nations of Christendom."

What Fight Ye for?
Right Rev. J. E. Cassidy, V. S., to
Massachusetts guardsmen, St. Ma
ry's Catholic Cathedral, Fall River,
Mass.
When men ask you, "What fight
ye for?" tell them, in tones that shall
wake up the dead of '76: "I fight for
liberty, for freedom's sake, lor right
eousness, for all my country's flag
ever represented. I fight for peace,
that ji'stice may prevail, that fright
fulness and inhumanity may not pos
sess the earth."
And here, if you will allow me
time, I would give answer to thosj
who would seemingly discredit your
sacrifice by telling you that this is
an unpopular war.
What war was ever popular in the
sense that they would have It? Was
the War for Independence popular?
Was the war for the preservation of
the Union popular? Was the Spanish
War popular? Popularity is no meas
ure of righteousness. Fighting wi'h
and killing each other is popular only
with ravages, and brave men do not
anticipate with joy the slaughtering
of their brethren. Someone has tru
ly said that war is hell, and hell is
hardly popular with anyone.
We abhor war, but we thank God
that we have not yet arrived at that
decadent and degenerate condition
wherein we would suffer anything
rather than fight. God forbid that
we should ever consider peace more
honorable or more desirable than
righteousness! God forbid that we
should purchase peace with dishonor!
God make us ever abhor war, but
God keep us from ever becoming too
cowardly to fight!
There is something else which
should be said and I trust I am not
amiss when I say it. There are too
many of varied ancestry, too many
of ancestry. If you will, like to mine,
Irish-Americans, whose judgment is
blinded by their hatred toward Eng
land. Let them beware lcvt their
animosity toward England be inter
preted as disloyalty to the United
States.
Out of the loins of a Fenian, arrest
ed in arms against the English, 1
enme. I was nursed at the breast of
as true an Irishwoman as ever came'
out of Ireland. Indelibly written in
my soul is the story of England's rule
of blood and iron in Ireland. But
what has that to do with the honor
of my own country? Incidentally and
accidentally we may lie fighting for
England just as England, now is fight
ing for us, but essentially and funda
mentally we are not fighting for Eng
land, we are fighting for ourselves.
Had Germany by its own overt acts,
repeated again and again, not made
it impossible for us to keep peace
with honor, had she respected our
rights, had she not murdered our cit
izens, she might have beaten Ens
land to her knees and we would not
have interfered. We did not go to
war to save England we went to war
to save ourselves, to save our sover
eign rights, to save all and everything
that a nation in honor prizes. You
men of all births, for there are men
of many bloods and births bearing a;

War's Great Poem
by American Boy
Every war has had its great poem;
a stirring,- blood-thrilling, soul-burning
verse that has had as much to
do with the fame and glory of that
war as the bayonets of the men on
the battleTield. Homer's Illiad is the
torch by which we see the Trojan
war. Macauley's "Horatius at the
Bridge." depicts the grandeur that
was Rome. The "Song of Roland" is
the life-blood of old France. Paul
Revere's ride breathes the spirit of
our revolution. "Sheridan's Ride"
and the "Battle Hymn of the Repub
lic" were the great poems of the
Civil war. "The Song of the Camp
is better known than most events of
the Crimean war. Byron's "Water
loo" is the epitaph of Napoleon. And
the world war now raging it, too,
has its great poem; a verse worthy
of even its towering eminence above
all other wars. An American wrote
it; a young American soldier of for
tune who fought in the Foreign Le
gion. He wrote of smiling skies and
spring flowers and wove his gar
lands into the very spirit of the bat
tlefields of France. Allan Seeger was
his name and he kept his "Rendez
vous" at Belloy en Santerre, July 4,
1916. Here is his song:
I Have a Rendezvous With Death.
I have a rendezvous with death
At some disputed Hurricade,
When spring comes 'round with rust
ling shade
And appleblossoms fill the air.
I have a rendouzvous with death.
When spring brings back blue days
and fair.
It may be he will take my hand
And lead me into his dark land;
It may be he will pass me still
I have a rendezvous with death
On some scarred slope of battered
hill, .
When spring comes 'round again
this year.
And the first meadow flowers appear.
God knows 'twere better to lie deep
Pillowed in silk or scented down.
When love throbs out in blissful sleep
And hushed awakenings are dear;
Pulse nigh to pulse and breath to
breath ;
I have a rendezvous with death
At midnight in some flaming town.
When spring comes tripping norta
this year;
And I to my pledged word am true
I shall not fail that rendezvous.

bitter against England, because two
years ago (this letter appears to have
been written about June 1. 1915, which
would make the date referred to the
early summer of 1913) a certain at
tack was made against bim over com
mercial matters in Great Britain and
It was only by appealing to the United
States department of state and a writ
of habeas corpus before the lord chief
justice of England that he escaped
successfully. He was in Eng
land and France at the outbreak of
the war; he has access to the great
sources of British and French offi
cial information. He wants to go
across to Europe and serve secretly
for Germany."
Of the completeness and skill of
Germany's spy system In this country,
a glimpse is afforded through the
voluminous correspondence of Dr.
Theo. Otto, of Allentown. Pa. Dr.
Otto's special concern was to ascer
tain the nature of the contracts for
munitions and arms upon which the
various factories In the neighborhood
were engaged and report them to the
German embassy. His wortc was such
as to earn him special commendation,
for which he expresses himself In one
of his letters as duly appreciative.
He was able, he states, "in my capa
city as a physician to establish re
lations with officials of almost all of
the munitions factories situated in
this vicinity." Either Dr. Otto sub
stitutes fancy for fact or he was able
to obtain curiously exact information
in many instances, such as the num
ber of foreign government Inspectors;
the character, caliber and quantity of
guns ordered by foreign governments;
and other valuable details. Of the
Traylor Engineering Co, of Allen
town, he writes In April of last year:
"An English Inspector is present in
the department,, and he most rigor
ously tests the work; but I was as
sured that he seemed to be Incompe
tent, inasmuch as he had been repeat
edly duped. Obviously the manage
ment of the concern attaches Impor
tance to creating a belief that all pro
jectiles being produced were Intended
for the United States government."
This, he comments, is belied by the
pressnce of foreign government in
spectors.' In these activities there was, of'
course, nothing illegal. Dr. Otto is
still practicing his profession in Al
lentown. He clams to be an Ameri
can citizen, though his claim is not
clear, and declares himself thorough
ly loyal to this country.
Closely related to and to some ex
tent under the guidance of Von Igel
was the German and Austro-Hunga-rian
labor Information and relief bu
reau, with central headquarters at;
136 Liberty street. New York City,
and branches in Cleveland, Detroit,
Bridgeport, Pittsburgh, Philadelphia,
and Chicago. The head of this en
terprise was Hans Liebeu, from whom
it took its familiarly accepted name
of the "liebau Employment Agency."
During the trying days which followed
the arrest of the Welland canal con
spirators it was unwaveringly assert
ed that the Liebau concern . was a
bona fide employment agency and
nothing else, with no object other
than to secure positions for German,
Austrian, or Hungarian workmen
seeking employment. That was for
publication only. In Von Igel's pa
pers the truth appears, ' brought out
by the refusal of the Austro-Hunga-rian
embassy to confine its subsidies
to the bureau.
That the Austro-Hungarian embas
sy bad taken official cognizance of
the bureau previously, however, is
disclosed in the letter written by the
Embassador to the Austro-Hungarian
minister for foreign affairs which was
found in the possession of James F. J.
Archibald by the British authorities
August 30, 1915. In this letter the
ambassador stated:
"It is my impression that we can
disorganize and hold up for months,
if not entirely prevent, the manufac
ture of munitions in Bethlehem and
the middle west, which, in the opinion
of the German military attache, is of
importance and amply outweighs the
comparatively small eypefrdituife of
money involved; but even if the
Btrikes do not come off it is probable
that we should extort, under pressure
of circumstances, more favorable con
ditions of labor for our poor, down
trodden fellow countrymen. So far a3
German workmen are found in the
skilled hands, means of leaving will
be provided immediately for them.
Besides this, a private German em
ployment office has been established
which provides employment for per
sons who have voluntarily given up
their places and it is already working
well. We shall also join in and the
wildest support is assured us."
The following representatives on be
half of the bureau's efficiency were
made, under date of March 24, 1916,
in a letter to the 'German ambassador.
Von Bernstorff.
"Engineers and persons In the bet
ter class of positions, and who had
means of their own, were persuaded
by the propaganda of the bureau to
leave war-material factories."
The report comments with uncon
cealed amusement upon the fact that
munitions concerns innocently wrote
the bureau for workmen (which, of
course, were not furnished) and con
tinues in reviewing later conditions in
the munitions industy.'
"The commercial employment bu
reau of the country have no supply
of unemployed technicians.
Many disturbances and suspensions
which war material factories have had
to suffer and which it was not always
possible to remove quickly, but which,
on the contrary, often lead to long
strikes, may be attributed to the en
ergetic propaganda of the employ
ment bureau."
Von Igels close connection with the
enterprise is indicated by a number
of items. For example, there is a
notation to the effect that H. Hanson
had established a Liebau branch of
fice in Detroit, an entry of $60 paid
to a Dr. Max Niven, of Chicago, in
February, 1916, for the "labor fund"
and an inquiry addressed by a bu
reau official to Von Igel, asking
whether the Bosch Magneto Works
manufactured if Uses for shells, the
bureau having evidently been applied
to for work for the Bosch plant The
reply, in the negative, stated that the
company was "universally known for
it.s friendly attitude for the Germans."
Several lines of communication be
tween the German diplomatic service
and the Irish revolutionary movement
are indicated in the captured docu
ments. John Devoy, of New York
City, sow editor of the Gaelic Ameri
can, a violent anti-British paper, was
one of the active agents of this con
nection., Significant entries appear
here and there; references to mes
sages from the German embassy at
Washington and the German consu
late at New York; mention of a sec
ret code to be employed in communi
cating with him and of a "cipher De
voy"; also a notation, the details of
which remain undiscovered, concern
ing "communication re manufacture
hand grenades." Devoy it was who
acted, for a time at least, as go-be-J
tween for the German secret service
dealings with Sir Roger Casements
executed by the British for treason.
There are sevral references to money
and messages for Sir Roger Casement
or, more briefly, "R. C." and one rec
ord of a check for $100 for Casement,
evidently bandied by Devoy.
Devoy's intimate connection with
the German cause is disclosed in two
letters to Ambassador von Bernstorff.
the texts of which follow:
New York, April 8, 1916.
The following communication from
confidential man John Devoy was
duly transmitted:
"Letter dated March 22, delayed by
censor, seems conclusive that first
messenger arrived safe with proposal
to send supplies and that" cable was
suppressed. Second also safe. Third,
with change of plans, due about April
15."
John Devoy further requests that
the following telegram be dispatched
to Sir Roger Casement:
"No letter now possible. All funds
sent home. Sister and M.'s family
well."
Should Sir Roger be absent or ill,
then J. D. requests that the telegram
be delivered to John Monteith.

To His Excellency,
the Imperial Ambassador,
Count von Bernstorff,
Washington, D. C.
New York. April 15, 1916.
Herewith enclosed a report
received by us today from John De
voy. Kindly order further steps to
be taken.
The important parta of the report
were sent there today per telegram.
(Signed) K. N. Sr.
To the Imperial Ambassador,
Count von Bernstorff,
Washington, D. C.
In view of the involvment of these
prominent Irish-American leaders in
the Casement plot and its German
ramifications, it is little to be won
dered at that they should have en
deavored to shoulder upon the Ameri
can government the responsibility for
the arrest of Casement. The Gaelic
American, Devoy's paper, and the
sympathetic German-American press
charged this government with having
on the strength of information ob
tained from the seized von Igel pa
pers, advised the British government
of the revolutionary plot and Case
ment's part therein.
The department of state and the
department of justice promptly re-'
futed the charges. When the von Igel
papers were seized In New York the
district attorney and bis assistants
busied themselves in a search for in
formation to sustain the indictments
which they had obtained against von
Igel, and overlooked for the time be
ing the great mass of other evidence
which pointed incriminatingly to oth
ers. Department of justice officials ad
mit that the papers relating to Case
ment were sent to Washington the
night before Casement's arrest was
reported, but they were not received
by the attorney general until the af
ternoon of the day upon which the
British authorities picked up the Irish
leader, and were not presented to the
state department until 7 o'clock that
evening. Meanwhile, Casement had
spent several hours in an Irish prison.
It is not improbable that the signa
ture at the bottom of the extraordi
nary message which follows is in the
"cipher Devoy" referred to in the
Von Igel papers. New York Supreme
Court Justice Daniel F. Cohalan has
long been prominent in Irish-American
circles, though he has never been
didectly identified with violent action.
That Judge Cohalan, however. Is
held in high favor by the pro-German
element of this country is evidenced
by the fact that Vlereck's Weekly, in
making selections recently for the
most important political offices in this
country, puts him forth for the posi
tion of United States senator from
New York.
The communication as translated in
to Von Igel's record is typewritten,
line for line, below a cipher, except
for the signature which remains un
translated from the original cipher
figures. It is dated New York, April
17, 1916, numbered 335-16, and in
scribed at the top "Very Secret."
"No. 335-16.
"Very Secret.
New York, April 17. 1916.
"Judge Cohalan requests the trans
mission of the following remarks:
"'The revolution in Ireland can
only be successful if supported from
Germany, otherwise England will be
able to suppress it. even though it be
only after hard struggles. Therefore
help is necessary. This should con
sist primarily, of aerial attacks in
England and a diversion of the fleet
simultaneously with Irish revolution.
Then, if possible, a landing of troops,
arms and ammunition in Ireland and
possibly some officers from Zeppe
lins. This would enable the Irish
ports to be closed against England
and the establishment of stations for
submarines on the Irish coast and the
cutting off of the supply of food for
England. The services of the revo
lution may therefore decide the war.
"He asks that a telegram to this
effect be sent to Berlin.
"5132 8167 0230.
"To His Excellency,
"Count von Bernstorff,
"Imperial Ambassador,
"Washington, D. C."
Along this same line is a code mes
sage by wireless to Banker Max
Moebius, Oberwallstrasse, Berlin,
which is interesting chiefly as show
ing the code method of important
communications practiced by the Ger
man official plotters in this country.
The code translation was found with
the copy of the message among von
Igel's papers. The original is a Ger
man dispatch which, being translated
into English, sounds like an innocent
business transaction, viz:
"National German ia Insurance con
tract certainly promised. Executor is
evidently satisfied with proposition.
Necessary steps have been taken.
"HENRY NEUMAN."
Not so innocent and harmless as it
looks, for what the message really
means is this:
"Irish agree to proposition. The
necessary step's have been taken."'
Canada was also the object of
solicitous interest on the part of Ger
many's representatives in America as
was rtartingly proven in the plot to
blow up the Welland canal. Another
lesser but not unpromising enterprise
against Canada was foregone by Von
Igel because the volunteer plotter was
too old, "though he has the best o!
good will," and also because of his
known connection with the Gaelic
American and the Indian Revolution
ists. Such is the indorsement upon
the letter, signed only "X," who thus
sets forth his qualifications for fo
menting disorders in Quebec.
"As honorary president of the first
Independence club started at Mon
treal about the time of the Boer war,
and of which the Hon. Honore Mer
cier, now minister of colonization in
the government of the Province of
Quebec, was one of the vice presi
dents and later president. I am well
known among the members and jour
nalists In that organization.
There is now in the place of the In
dependence club a secret society based
upon its principles, aiming at the to
tal separation of Canada from the
British Empire. It includes
all the former members of the Inde
pendence club and men. high in Can
adian political life. The adherents
are for the most part French and Ir
ish Canadians. I am daily
in connection with one of the lead
ing men in the separation movement.
Hon. J. Hall Kelly, who is a membei
of the legislative council of the Pro
vince of Quebec and also a member
of the governmeat."
Information carefully and exten
sively set forth in the secret docu
ments of the German officialdom was
sometimes wide of the facts. For e:i
ample, a lengthy memorandum of
March 1, 1916, transmitted by the
secret agent, Capt. Boehm, dealing
with the Mexican crisis, appears to
have been largely the work of some
fervid and projective imagination.
The momorandum purports to outline
President Wilson's expected message
to congress. It predicts that the
president will attribute Mexico's anti
American activities direct to German
money and Incitement; that he will
call upon congress to support him in
radical measures (the prophet ever,
attemps to paraphrase the language
to be employed in the message); that
congress will indorse the president's
stand, following which upward of 150
German spies and agents provoca
teurs were to be arrested and the am
bassadors of the central powers to
receive their passports.
For all this, Capt. Boehm's author
ity is thus indicated over his own
signature:
"The following nemorandum was
just given to me by an acquaintance
returning from Washington. The 'ac
quaintance' is a skillful journalist
who has good connections. I can not
vouch for his reliability, but I know
that he hates the present administra
tion and fights it. His informant is
a former secretary of the American
embassy at Rome now in Washing
ton." Capt Boehm himself was too loose
of tongue for the good of his service,
it would appear from a report of th
German military information bureau
dated March 21, 1916.
"('apt. Boehm decided to leave
ter reports received here were sul
mifted to him to the effect that mem
bers of the press were Informed as
to his personality and the purpose of
his being here. Too great confidence
in the silence of his fellow men, es
pecially the . members of the Ameri
can Truth society, Was
probably the cause of his becoming
quickly known here."
So the notorious American Truth
society, which so strenuously denied
its pro-German associations, figures
as Indirectly linked up with Ger
many's secret representatives. This
society is still extant and Jeremiah
A. O'Leary, its moving spirit, is now
the editor of Bull, recently shut out
of the mails for publishing seditious
matter.
Many Inventors, some of them ob
viously cranks, are represented either
by correspondence or notation as hav
ing plans involving the use of sundry
devices of destruction. One entry of
the sort merits special attention be
cause of the notoriety of the individ
ual involved. Here it is, .translated
from the German record of corres
pondence: "June 15, 1915. Sender, G. S. Viei
eck. Contents, Inquiry as to bombs;
supply offer. Told to send further
details."
Possibly the further details are in
dicated in another entry of four
months later.
"Sender, Viereck. Contents, offer
of picric acid."
Picric acid Is a constituent of many
high explosives. Mr. Viereck is some
thing of a high explosive himself, hav
ing been editor of the virulently pro
German weekly Fatherland, of New
York,, now changed in title (but not
In purpose) to "Viereck's Weekly."
Just what interest Dr. L. A. Dessar,
of 25 Broad street, New York City,
had in German aerial warfare is a
matter for speculation.
In the Von Igel archives appears a
letter from R. L. Scoville. of Sewick
ley, Pa., and New York City, urging
the merits of the Semple aerogrenad".
Dr. Dessar evidently forwarded the
letter where he thought it would do
the most good, viz. to Von Igel.
Carefully preserved (for what pur
pose one can only conjecture) are two
letters written early In 1916 by T. J.
Dowling, of 107 Franklin avenue,
Hartford, Conn., to Count von Bern
storff, the German ambassador, ex
plaining a little plan of the writer's
to get rooms near various munitions
factories and blow them up. Specifi
cally, he expressed willingness to de
stroy the Scoville Manufacturing com
pany and the Chase Mills, of Water
ville, Conn.; the Remington Arms
company and the Union Metalic Cart
ridge company factories in Bridge
port, Con., and when that was com
pleted he thought that he might go
out to Port Huron, Mich., and blow
up the Grand Trunk tunnel near that
place. As all these constructions are
still standing, it is obvious that Mr.
Dowling's plans failed to commend
themselves to his distinguished cor
respondent. His present whereabouts
are not known.
Other would-be destroyers of Ger
many's foes were less definite. Fami
ly pride was the energizing motive of
Mr. C. J. Waldron of Medusa, N. Y.,
who wrote that, being a direct de
scendant of Baron von Waldron, he
was deeply interested in the German
cause, wherefore he proffered (April
10, 1916.) a shell of bis own inven
tion. It was not accepted.
A note of grim humor is supplied by
William J. Ruff, of Quincy, 111. .whose
letter of July 26, 1915, to Capt. von
Papen suggests new methods of blow
ing up trenches and planting mines
for ships. "My sole idea," explains
the ingenuous Mr. Ruff, "is to help
and save lives" (!) Nothing in the
von Igel archives supplies evidence
that Mr. Ruffs singular liJ4 saving
practices were adopted.
Of more direct military interest to
this country is the espionage enter
prise hinted at in a secret code mes
sage of April 11. 1916, signed "13232
46729 46919." addressing von Igel to
this effect:
"Herewith respectfully send an ex
tract regarding the troops stationed
in California and the armament of
the coast fortifications."
Journalists, lecturers and publish
ers were liberally employed by von
Igel and his associates for the pur
pose of German propaganda. Among
those thus tainted with the stigma of
dishonorable professional conduct are
two magazine writers and war cor
respondents, James F. J. Archibald,
now in Washington, and Edwin Emer
son, said to be in Africa. The follow
ing curious entry appears in von Ig
el's records:
"Pure War Expense.
"Edwin Emerson $1,000
"Faid Play (Mr. Braun) $2,000
"Fair Play ( " " ) $1,500
"Marcus Braun $1,000
"J. Archibald $5,000
Coneerining the identity of the last
entry there might be room for doubt
but for a signed receipt from J. F. J.
Archibold acknowledging the sum of
$5,000 from the German embassy
for propanganda work. What return
Archibold ever made in service is not
clear, except that certain war corre
spondence for which he contracted
with New York newspapers was so ob
viously prejudiced on the side of the
central powers that they declined to
accept it.
That Emerson also overdid the cause
to which he sold his pend and pro
fessional honor (the record indicates
that he was paid $1,i00 for "traveling
expenses") is suggested by the fact
that he was expelled, or alleged to
have been expelled, from Berlin for a
violent attack upon Ambassador Ge
rard. Emerson has had a picturesque
career in many parts of the world,
and once cabled to a New York news
paper a picturesque but imaginative
account of his own death in the Far
East under5 painful and Interesting
conditions. He was born In Dresden,
of American parents, and is now
traveling under American passport ob
tained by false representations.
"Fair Play," that misnamed organ
of Teutonic Inspiration, appears to
have been subsidized auite dispropor
tionately to its value, since it received
in all $4,500 in the course of a few
months in 1915. Marcus Braun. who
appears as its editor. Is known as a
political leader anion? the Hungarians

ine innges oi int? puuni ai iuu nunu. j
He Is supposed himseir to be a Hun
garian. His associate in Fair Play
was one J. P. Bryan.
Even with such liberal support
"Fair Play" did not fill the bill, for
in January, 1916, a letter was written
by F. Schroeder, a German newspaper
correspondent in Tokio, to the German
diplomatic representatives lamenting
the lack of a genuinely influential
weekly In New York devoted to Teu
tonic interests, and suggesting that
one Borsodl mfght be the right man
to conduct such a publication.
Frequent hints of George Sylvester
Viereck's Journalistic activities ap
pear, and there are a few notations of
"Pearson: Subject, Press," which may
refer to Pearson's Magazine, of which
the editor, Frank Harris, is strongly
I pro-German, or may indicate a secret
j agent named Pearson, who is the sub
ject of other entries.
The lecture platform Is represented
i by Ray Beveridge. the California art
ist, and sister of Kuehne Beveridge,
the prominent sculptor. In one entry
Privy Counsellor Albert acknowledges
receipt of $3,000 from the embassy tt
finance Miss Beveridge's lecture tour.
German war pictures were also tft
be furnished, though the alleged scope
of the lectures was to be comprised
in topics allied to Red Cross work.
Other figures of more vauge import
drift into light here and there in the
Von Igel papers or the bureau of In
vestigation reports. Col. E. G. Wood
ford, an old British hater, appears to
have received sundry suras o fmoney
for services unspecified. The follow,
ing letters found in the Von Igel
papers refer to Col. Woodford:
Near York, April 4, 1916.
His Excellency Mr. von Igel,
New York, N. Y.:
' According to a letter received here
today the imperial embassy is of the
same opinion as myself that money i
should not be paid to Woodford.
Please act accordingly and inform!
Woodford, if he should show up there i
again, that Berlin has received the
letter regarding the sum to be paid
and has besides again been asked by
telegraph whether money should be
paid.
Until answer is received from Ber
lin, nothing more can be paid.
(Singed) PRETZELL.
Colonel Woodford appears, however,
from the following letter to have re
ceived the sums promised:
New York. April 10, 1916.

War Work Being Done In

By the National Y. W. C. A.

Bear Its Part In Raising Mil-'

ed Upon to Raise $7,000 of
This Sum "Hostess
Houses" for All Training
Camps, Training, Protection
And Chaperonage for Girls.
Work Is Done Only By
Government Invitation and
Co-Operation.
Few people know anything about
or begin to realize the vital importance
of the great work undertaken by the
National Y. W. C. A. in connection
with the war. Nor do they have but
a dim Idea of the tremendous task
ahead and its wide scope and far
reaching consequences for good. More
than a million men will be mobilized
this winter into cantonments stretch
ing in a line from California to New
York. Thousands of young women
will also be called to shop, factory
and business house by the war. The
moral problems arising from these
war conditions are multiplied over
those confronting the nation in time
of peace.
' The Y. W. C. A. has stepped into
the breach heart and soul and wIJI
do all it can to grapple with this
social vortex of the war. Its first
great effort will be directed towards
the social and moral side of the can
tonments. It has been called upon
by the governments of the United
States, France and Russia to aid in
this work. It does not make a move
or enter a camp without direct invi
tation and co-operation of the war de
partment and the officials of that
camp.
H must raise a million to carry on
this work. California, Nevada and
Arizona - have been grouped for the
Pacific coast field and will be called
upon' to raise $175,000 of this sum.
Arizona, with only three Y. W. C. A.
institutions, will be asked for $10,400
and of this sum Bisbee, with her fine
1'. W. C. A. record, will furnish $7,000.
Mrs. Walter Douglas ,the other day,
by request of Miss Moyer, secretary
of the Bisbee Y. W. C. A., addressed
the members in which she set forth
the plans and purposes of this great
work. Mrs. Douglas is a member of
the Pacific coast field committee, has
made a close study of this problem
and is bending her energy and devot
ing her thought to this work which
three national governments regards
as vital to placing first class and ef
fective armies in the field. In her
address she makes remarkable dis
closures, gathered throughout Ameri
ca and Europe. Her facts regarding
how much has been done and how
much more is planned are astounding.
Then again, every step and movement
of this work has been and will continue
to be intensely practical. Silly and
false stories have already been cir
culated and printed about this move
ment, but here is the real and wonder
ful and gripping story of it all as set
forth by Mrs. Douglas in her Y, W. C.
A. address:
THE ADDRESS.
Miss Moyer has asked me to tell
you about the special war work of the
National Young Woman's Christian
association, which we have been re
quested to do by the war department,
and which every association will wish
to have a part in, to its fullest pos
sible extent
The first week in June, Mrs. Speer,
our national president, received from
the war department commission on
training camp activities, an urgent
letter requesting that the association
furnish 30 expert workers with wom
en to train local committees to cope
with the problem of women in the
training camps.
As this work promised to be very
extensive, covering a large field and
for a long period of time, a war coun
cil was organized for emergency war
work, to co-operate with the Ked Cross
and the Y. M. C. association. Our
pait, being to help the men by help
ing the girls and not to interfere witli
the work of either of these associa
tions. Mrs. James Stewart Cushnian was
appointed as president and'as she had
to give all her time to this she was
forced to give up her work as presi
dent of the N. Y. City association,
and the Metropolitan barU. That
work has been taken over by Mrs.
Fellows Morgan, wife of the president

The friendly relations existing be
tween the two i associations are ex
pressed clearly and strongly in a let
ter I shall read to you from John R.
Mott, secretary of the International
Y. M. C. A. committee, to Mrs. Cush
man in which he expresses his deep
interest in this great war work to es
tablish a zone of moral safety around
the training camps.
Our organization is peculiarly fitted
to take over this work as it is the
largest national organization of wom
en in this country, having a member
ship of over 365,000 women. This
comprises women of all classes, the
immigrant, country girl, girl in indus
try, the girl in business, the student,
and the woman of leisure. Every one
of whom can contribute her bit, and
help in this work. Our trained work
ers were ready in the beginning to
take over a great deal of useful work
amongst which was a detachment 61
500 trained nurses, who were ready
to go into the field at once.
A constructive program has also
been outlined for work along lines of
war recreation in all departments and
a spiritual helpfulness.
Train Women to Be Police Officers.
The national board is represented n
the national war council by five wom
en, the association is also represent
ed on a committee organized by Mayor
Mitchell of New York, called the
Mayor's Committee of National De
fense, and at least five of the sub
committees have representatives from
our association in the industrial, food
aid, survey of nurses, employment and
social welfare departments. The com
mittee on social welfare is trying out
an interesting experiment looking to
wards a trained corps of police offi
cers. These women to take the place
of men principally in the large centers
where ammunition plants and factor
ies, for war work have brought togeth
er a large number of women .
Among the organizations which we
have been requested to assist is tKt,
state council of defense for California,
They ask for a synopsis of our em
ployment plan to send out as bulletins
to their county chairmen.
Local Work In American Campa,
At what was, I think, our first meet
ing of the war emergency council,
Mrs. Cushman received a telegram
from the officer in charge at Platts
burg .asking her to send that day two
experts to help him solve the choatle
conditions that existed at Plattsburg,
where the mothers, wives, sisters and
sweethearts of the men in training
there, were simply swarming the
camp. Everyone thought she had somt
claim for assistance from the com
manding officer. Mrs. Cushman re
ceived this telegram at 4 o'clock and
at 4:45 was the last train for Platts
burg, she turned to Miss Schooley,
who was present, and asked her to
secure one of the other expert work
en and leave on the 4.45.
Miss Schooley left the council, rush
ed home, put some things into her bag
and fled to the station, accompanied
by Miss Shafer. Unfortunately Miss
Shafer's legs were not as long as Miss
Schooley's so she missed the train,
and' Miss Schooley, single-handed,
raced the commanding officer a tew
Lours later. He simply told her the
situation that these women were over
rvjiring the camp, and wh''e he ap
pieciated their desire to see as much
as they could of their men before they
left for the front, it was Impossible
tc have women in the camp and ask
ed Mibs Schooley to uandle tin situa
tion. That she was successful is evidenc
ed by the facts she told of on her
visit to Santa Barbara, when sl'.e gave
a talk on what "War Means ti Girls."
In the first place The made a sur
vey of conditions at the Plattsburg
camp and discovered not only were
the visiting women coming tlicre but
the girls in the town. In numberless
hordeB wandered along the road from
the city to the -camp from 7 in the
morning untill 10 at night. There
was no place where any womeii could
rest of be fed or sie their men and
they were lined up outside the walla
of the cantonment in the hope of
catching a glimpse of the men in the
few intervals between work, the first
being at 7 a. m.
The First "Hostess House.'
Miss Schooley sent hurried calls for
financial assistance to the council
which were responded to by Mrs.
Henry Davidson, wife of the president
of the Red Cross, who gave the money
($10,000) to build the first Hostess
FBOPOSED MILLION DOLLAR
WOMEN AND GIRLS.
House. On the morning of the lOtn
day at 8 o'clock there were 195 wom
en sitting in rockers on the front
porch of this building and meals wera
being served from the tiny kitchen
ette, which had only been designed
for light housekeeping, to over 1,000
people.
The house was so cosy and homelike
that it was crowded with men when
they had a spare moment because they
knew that their mothers, wives and
sweethearts when thsy came to the
camp could be found there.
Among the services rendered by this
tittle house was a prepared list of all
the available, respectable boarding
houses and accommodations in Plaits
burg to which women might be sem.
As this house has been proved such
a useful type, although it was con
structed from a rough sketch made by
Miss Schooley to meet the needs of the
moment, it is planned to build them
for all the camps .except that uiis
building having been so successful,
the new buildings will be about three
times the size of this one at Platts
burg. The Plattsburg Hostess House con
tains a large general reception hall,
a small cafeteria, large fire places in
both these rooms which take in six
foot logs .and on cold nights are very
cheery. They had a rest room with
cots where women could lie down,
a dressing room and a kitchenette.
The only three Hostess Houses thus
far constructed are at Plattsburg,
Voungstown, N. Y. and Allentown, Pa.
Within the next six months the fol
lowing houses will be erected:
Junction City, Kansas.
Ayer, Mass.
San Diego (Linda Vista), Presidio.
(San Francisco), CaL
American Lake, Washington.
Demlng, New Mexico.
Law ton, Oklahoma.
Fort Worth, Texas.
Yaphank, Long Island.
Arizona has most of her draft quota
stationed at Junction City and the
First Arizona militia will likely Soon
be sent to Linda Vista.
These houses have proved the per
fect solution of the visiting relations,
ilthough in a great many of these
:amps the Y. M. C. associations have
:ood buildings and writing rooms for
he men but there is no place for girls.
?or an example, at Plattsburg, the
iecretary who was doing single-handed
the work for all these men was ab
solutely distracted. He was a capable
and efficient young man to handle
:he men's problem, but he said to
Miss Schooley, "what am I to do, the
lace swarms with girls I can't put
;hem out and they don't seem to know
hey should not come in."
Conditions at Fort Riley.
At Fort Riley.where General Leon
rd Wood is in command, and our
rafted men have gone, the army en
losure occupies 30,000 acres and is
arranged to accommodate 100,000
nen. The principal problem there is
i large amusement concession which
-ias established itself next door to the
government ground ground and em
ploys an army of girls. These girl
vill have to be protected in therr
iesure hours, as they work about 10
ours and have 12 hours to get into
Jiischier. I understand this conces
sion is on the order of the '"Zone" at
the exposition, and these girls need
a proper place to eat and sleep and
suitable recreation and if possible b
induced to give some of their leisure
to constructive war work along the
lines where they can help.
At Charleston.
At Charleston where we also re
ceived a hurried call for two workers
to go to camp and make surveys, tho
situation was made critical by a large
uniform factory, starting work in the
navy yard and several other kinds of
factories. The influx of women wts
several thousand. tf.iese gins come
largely from the country, never before
in a city; they are earning more
money than they ever had in their
lives $15 to $23 a week. These girts
had absolutely no place to sleep, the
management of the factories taking no
part in preparing accommodations for
the workers, but they are gradually
being interested in the welfare of their
women workers. Iteds have been
shipped by carloads and everything
done as rapidly as possible to amelior
ate the condition of these women
practically made homeless.
A definite social question still to be
answered is found in the fact that
these women work 10 hours shifts,
one shift by day and one shift by night,
in buildings which have no fans, no
screens and no rest rooms. The more
immediate question has been that of
housing them adequately and safely.
The commandant of the navy yeard
and the officers of the Y. W. C. A.
have worked together well in this re
spect. Each woman employed at the
navy yards is turned over to the Y. i
W. C. A., which places her in a good ,
home in the city. The Confederate
College for Women has been used as
a wormitory for 40 girls working dur
ing the summer vacation period, and
will be replaced when college opens
this fall, by a house of about the same
capacity, now being remodled. A
recreation house has been equipped '
at Sullivan's Island, a pleasure resort
near Charleston. There the women
may meet men friends under proper
conditions.
In California.
In California the camps at Linda
Vista, Mare Island, Presidio and San
Pedro are having surveys made at
the present time by Miss Suothwick
of Santa Barbara and as soon as her
survey has been completed we expect
to erect as many Hostess Houses as
possible and send paid and volunteer
workers to these places to look after
the girls and women and direct their
activities into useful and norma!
channels.
You all probably know of the work
which is being done on the border
San Antonio, El Paso and Douglas
where the association is now at work.
The comparatively small needs in the
little towns along the Mexican border
and the limitations of funds and work
ers directed our attention to the larg
er cities where hundreds of girls with
little or no home influences made nec
cessary a positive answer to the ques
tion, "What are you going to do about
it?"
Special Opportunity of the Y. W. C. A.
The special opportunity of the
Young Women's Christian association
was to guide these young girls into
good relationship and to help -them
to find higher Ideals for their lives.
At one of the three most important
centers San Anotnio the special
workers can use the splendid equip
ment of the association in organizing
Girls' clubs, where the girls feel the
responsibility of upholding the digni
ty and hoor of the club and sharing
with the next girl something of the
new interests brought her through
the war.
The plan carried out in San Antonio
is being followed in general in El
Paso, first in importance as to its
number of troops. With a 12 months
"out of door climate" the city offers
a splendid setting for an enthuiastic
Recreation League. Organized to
inee the girls "where they are."
Club at Douglas.
In Douglas, Arizona, no Y. W. C.
A. has been established, but through
'.he interest of many of its people
and through their feeling of responsi
bility for the girl "who had nothing
planned for her," a Y. W. club is now
busily at work. It is already over
i
flowing it modest headquarters, which '
must as yet remain in the small, but
only available building, in that busy
and crowded city. For the girls wfco
are in school, for those at work in
the stores, for the teachers and the
nurses in the army hospital, for the
matron and the girl employed in the;
kitchen for all of these the dub;
exists. Iits first announcement de-,
clares that the Y. W.'s club throws'
open its doors to every girl and wom-j
an in the city who wishes to become ;
a member. The mission of the club
is to be a house of friendliness aed ;
good cheer with the latch string on
the outside. Come as often as you '
will. A cordial welcome awaits you. i
This league hopes to be a construe- j
live force for good among the girls j
and young women of the city. The
Y. W. C. A., the Women's club and tlfc j
D. A. R. working together, were re- j
cently able to check the plan to staiv'
a dance hall which threatened tempta
tion to the young people of that city,
and the association is therefore most
eager that this league shall be th
right gind of substitute for girls all
through the city.
Foreign Work.
Besides the work which is pouring
in on us at home we have had calls
from the foreign field in France. Wfc
have Miss Dingman, a wonderful work
er, who is bringing to France the ex
perience of industrial members in
American associations. She was ask
ed by the national committee of the
French government to go over and
make an industrial survey, and take
with her two other experts.
She is making a wonderful survey
of the industrial conditions amongst
he French girls where three and one
half million girls will be needed to
carry on the ordinary industries ot
the country.
In Russia we have two workers
These expert workers were requested
a month ago by the then existing gov
ernment of Russia to do the same
thing for them as we are doing for
France. As the industrial condition
there are in such chaos, it is almost
reared that hard as it Is to spare more
workers for foreign fields that these
' two women will need more help be
fore they get the industrial conditions
of girls straightened out in Russia.
The finance committee has prepar
ed a careful statement of the work,
as the estimated budget, which I will
not read in detail, comes to one mil
lion dollars, absolutely nedessary
more can be used, if it is raised.
Most Important of All.
The Hostess House and the recrea
tions for girls engaged in war work
are our two most important necessi
ties. Houses thus far estimated have
been small buildings costing about
five hundred dollars each. Larger
ones, made imperative in the large
camps, have not yet been estimated
in accurate figures, but will cost in
the neighborhood of from $15,000 to
$19,000 each.
In apportioning the sum necessary
to carry out this work the Pacific
