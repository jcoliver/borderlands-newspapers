FIGHTING FRENCHMEN j
WITH THE BRITISH ARMY IX
FRANCE, Aug. 26, (10 p. m., By
the Associated Press.) The Ger
man retirement is continuing along
many parts of the battle front to
night. British are overwhelming
the enemy's rear guards in heavy
fighting.
Reports indicate that at least one
counter attack has been broken up
by the British artillery concentrat
ing its fire on massed enemy
troops.
UNDATED WAR LEAD. BY THE
ASSOCIATED PRESS. While the Ger
mans were busily engaged in defend
ing themselves against the attacks of
the British and French armies from
the Ancre river to the region ol Sois-
ons. Field Marshal Haig early; Mon- '
Jay mominir'struck tinotTieT BUrprtae''
blow over a new front north of the
old battle zone. The new offensive ;
was launched from the east of Arras ;
on the Scarpe river and southward
to the. Cojeul. All along the front
the British pressed forward at some
places to a depth of more than two
miles and captured a half dozen or
more villages, among them Monchy-Le-Preux,
Guenappe and Wancourt.
Across the Cojeul the new British
attacks on the old battle front,
brought them to the villages of Mory
and St. Leger, and farther south the
small town of Fevreuil, one and a half
miles northeast of Bapaume, from
which the British pressed on eastward
about a mile. Farther south the Bri
tish are reported unofficially to have
reached the western outskirts of Thil
loy in the nipper movement they are
carrying out against Bapaume. With
Haig's men now standing well within
gun range of the town it seems likely
that the Germans will be forced to
evacuate Bapaume in short order.
Additional gains also have been
made by the British east of Albert and
on both sides of the Somme river. In
fact, notwithstanding the efforts of
the Germans through the use of large
reinforcements to hold them in check,
the British and French all along the
line from Albert to Soissons have ma
terially bettered their positions and
carried further forward their plan of
making the Picardy battle ground un
tenable for the enemy.
The French again are hammering
away at the environs of Roye, one of
the strong points of the Somme-Oise
front the capture of which doubtless
would cause the giving up by the en
emy of the entire salient from the
Somme in the north to Noyon. Fres-noy-Les-Roye
to the north and St.
Mard to the south of Roye both have
been captured by the French, despite
the desperate resistance of the Ger
mans and Roye, like Bapaume in the
north, apparently is in danger of be
ing pinched out of the line in an en
veloping movement. More than 600
prisoners were taken by the French
in the operation.
The Germans have thrown further
heavy counter attacks against the
French in the region north of Sois
sons, where the French continue their
pressure northward in maneuvers
which seriously threaten to outflank
the Chemin Des Dames and Laon sec
tors and to put the entire German line

LONDON, Aug. 26 The British

The outstanding feature of the
exploit was the heroic determina

They were heavily attacked as
they flew to their objectives; they
knew that equally stern fighting
would await them on their way
back, but nothing daunted them.
"It takes more than the risk of dan

Final Vote Will Be Taken Not
Later Than 4 O'Clock This
Afternoon.. According ..to
' Agreement
(By Review Leased Wire)
WASHINGTON, Aug. 26. By
unanimous consent the senate
agreed tonight to vote not later
than 4 o'clock tomorrow after
noon on the administration man
power bill extending the draft
ages to IS and 45 years. Debate
will be limited after 1 o'clock.
, Discussion of the military com
mittee's work or fight amendment
was in progress when the senate
adjourned. Other important ques
tions in controversy left over for
settlement tomorrow included sev
eral proposals for exempting or
restricting the service of youths
under 21.
Free education of boys under 21 who
enlist or are drafted is provided for
in an amendment by Senator Reed of
Missouri, adopted during today's de
bate. Under its terms youth would be
permitted to enter educational insti
tutions at government expense for a
period equalling their military service,
not to exceed two years.
In discussing the Thomas "work or
fight" amendment which was added
to the house draft of the bill by the
senate military committee. Senator
Jones of Washington and Cummins of
Iowa, both said they believed the pres
ent law covers all the exigencies whi-h
the amendment is intended to touch,
the latter adding he believed some re
strictions such as through heavy tax
ation should be imposed on employer?,
imposing unfair conditions on their
employes. ' '
.While adding that Uie existing law if
construed properly would have the de
sired effect of meeting the present
situation and making all persons with
in draft age engage in occupations es
sential to the prosecution of the war.
Senator Thomas of Colorado said that,
in view of interpretations made by Sec
retary Baker the evil growing out of
exemptions for industrial reaso.is
would be increased, instead of dimin
ished, unless some additional legisla
tion is enacted.
Senator Thomas said he did not
believe the duty of the soldier at the
front, although in most cases more
dangerous, is any different that that of
the producer at home and that there
should be no distinction. He denied
that tHere were any nights except
those of fundamental origin, such as
trial by jury that should be allowed to
continue when the destiny of a nation
is at stake. Because the war is oOim)
miles away. Senator Thomas declared,
the American people apparently do
not realize the stupendous task thai
is ahead.
Senator McKellar of Tennessee in
terjected that in order to be fair, he
believed the amendment should apply
alike to the employer and the em
ploye. Senator Fall of New Mexico, pre
sented a substitute for the Thomas
amendment, providing for registration
)f all men up to 60 years of age who
under regulations prescribed by the
president would be classified for mili
tary and industrial service. Another
substitute, offered by Senator Hitch
cock of Nebraska, proposes that men
shall be subject to reclassification in
event the reasons for thei rexemption
or deferred classification cease to ex

WASHINGTON, Aug. 26. Dif
ferences between the treasury and
the house ways and means ccu:ir
niiltee as to the levying o' a 3
per cent differential on unearned
incomes appeared tonight to be the
only obstacle to completion of the
drafting of the revenu bill. Steps
toward an agreement were consid
ered at a conference between'
Chairman Kitchin and Secretary
McAdoo. Another will be held to
morrow. Mr. Kitchin tonight in
dicated the committee might not
be able to report the bill before
Friday instead of Thursday as hed
been planned, because of the tern-'
porary disagreement.
Coincident with negotiations
started in the senate between pro
hibition and anti-prohibition lead
ers to postpone the effective date
cf the war time national proht
bition measure, provisions of the
revenue bill dealing with taxes on
Intoxicating liquor became known.
The session of the .committee today
was marked by an attempt by Repre
sentative Moore, republican, of. Penn
sylvania, to attach to the bill an
amendment authorizing the appoint
ment of a joint congressional commit
tee to co-operate with the president in
eliminating waste and extravagance in
the conduct of the war. The pl.ui,
which would have authorized a joint
committee of six members of the sen
ate and seven mer.ibe"s of the house
to confer with th-i piesiueiit and heads
of departments on all matters relating
to war expenditures reporting to con
gress, was rejected hv the committee
by a trict party vote.
' In the controversy on the unearned
differential. Secretary McAdoo has
conttnded that failure to make thJ

The boy is said to have been with
his twin brother at the time of the
accident, but it was said last night
that a number of boys in that vicin

had been driven away on several occa

' DOUBLE HEADER AT

C. & A. TAKES FIRST GAME BY
SCORE OF 3 TO 1 WHILE SEC
OND WENT TO JUNCTION
BRIGGS BY SCORE OF 11 TO 2
BIG CROWD OUT
A large crowd, as usual, gathered
to see Sunday's double header base
ball game between the Junctlon-Briggs
and A. & C. teams. In which a score
ol three to one brought the C. & A.
team out as the victors of the first
game and the Junction-Briggs as the
winner? of the second by a score of
eleven to two. Oswalt pitched both
games for the Junction-Briggs, but
Curley hurled a fine game of ball and
outpitched him in the first game, giv
ing no chance for the Junction-Briggs
to gather much from his delivery. He
shut them out for seven innings and
would have deprived them of their
score had it not been for errors.
When Berkel hit a grounder to Cur
ley bringing Oswalt home he also fix
ed for himself a fine place on first,
but Pittman ended the inning by giv
ing a liner toward center which Smith
made use of and called the base hit,
off. The C. & A. team was the first
to score and that was in the sixth in
ning. A dandy three bagger was Young
man's contribution to hitting and Bi
john shone in his fielding and speedy
head work. Younman came home with
a score on Krigbaum'g hit. The C. &
A. made their last run in the eightn
when Curley scored on Krigbaum's
gly to Bijohn.
The second game favored the Junction-Briggs.
It Was in the sixth in
ning that a change of ball was seen
and Toner could only reach first but
with Wilson's hit to Johnson be made
his stop on third and Berkel walked.
Johnson and Toner started the sev
enth inning fine and Wilson with his
hit scored Johnson and Toner follow
ed him.

''Keep your stomach in good work

RUSHING AID TO THE CZECHS.
The Allied expedition into Siberia, of
which American forces are taking an im
portant part, really presents one of the
most dramatic races against time that the
great war has produced. To achieve the
success hoped for it, some 500 miles of ter
ritory must be cleared of bolsheviki and
armed German prisoners of war who have
been turned loose by the treacherous bol
sheviki; the railroad must be linked up be
hind the armed expedition and tunnels
that are being blown in by the bolsheviki
must be cleared. And all this must be ac
complished before winter sets in, some time
in October, else the allied cause may suffer
an unfortunate setback.
The public has heard of the Czecho
slovak forces battling against the bolshe
viki, and which the allied expedition will
attempt to back up. But the inside story,
of that heroic band of soldiers who have
offered their all for liberty makes up one
of the most dramatic stories- of this dra
matic war.
The Czechs force is made up nearly al
together of soldiers who deserted from the
Austrian armies to fight Austria and force
freedom and recognition for oppressed Bo
hemia. The revolution left them stranded.
If they stayed on the east front and were
gobbled up by the Germans or Austrians
they would have been hanged as traitors.
The bolsheviki wanted to get rid of them.
So a deal was made that they were to sur
render all but one-tenth of their arms and
be allowed a free and unrestricted passage
to Valdivostok, where they were to take
ships for France, to again battle against the
Huns and for liberty. So the pilgrimage of
the lovers of liberty began. When they
got into Siberia the red guard began to ob
struct their passage. The Czechs were
traveling in small parties: These were aug
mented by fellow countrymen who escaped
from Siberian prison camps. Several
times they have had to fight their way
through bolshevik and Geirnan forces,
made up of prisoners armed by the bolshe
vik. Nothing braver in all the war by any
heroes or set of heroes of the allied armies
has been witnessed than this resolute re
sistance of these Czechs to German con
quest. Some fifteen thousand odd members of
this force have reached Vladivostok. An
other fifty thousand are strung out from
the Ural mountains to Irkutsk and Lake
Baikal. But the two parties are separated
by a stretch of territory and railroad about
520 miles long in the control of the bolshe
vik red guard and armed ex-German pris
oners. More German prisoners have been
armed to assist the bolsheviki and the situ
ation of the Czech army on the other side
of Lake Baikal is most perilous unless aid
can reach it before winter sets in.
"No peace that satisfies Germany can
ever satisfy us. It cannot be a negotiated
peace. It must be a dictated peace and we
and our allies must dictate it." Senator
Lodge of Massachusetts.
A NEW WAR INDUSTRY RECORD.
tVlt.'A till: KJ IIM II' raid )
Hi" plaudits that uo to llie shipbuilders
are rrjti -.l!y des"rved by the copper miners
of Arir.ona, wh:; in the month of July
broke toother r'r oid production. I hey
are !;iknK out copper ore at the rate of
800.000,000 pounds a year, which is con
siderably ir"re than ever before wp.s mined
by any state in the union; far more than
Arizona ever produced in previous years,
and Aiiona has lmr j-rn the leader. At
the current price of 26 cents a pound the
copper will be worth $208,000,000. I low
ever, I he year s average will not be 26 cents
a pound, for until recently the pric? w-is
23J, ? cents n pound. 1 he men of the smelt
ers deserve credit squal to the miners, for
as great as has been the production of ore
the smelters have kept right up with it and
are turning out every pound into copper
at a rate truly marvelous.
A fact worthy of notice is that the profit
of the companies is small, owing to the high
costs and moderate revenue, while the
wage3 of employes are higher than ever
before were paid in the histry of the in
dustry. Of all the millions that copper
production brings to the companies most
of these millions are paid out to employes
and by them are distributed in the channels
of trade. No wonder Arizona is rich..
Copper is just as much a war industry a3
shipbuilding, for it is now announced that
practically every pound of copper mined
goes into a war industry and contributes di
rectly to the prosecution of hostilities
against Germany.
The Stars and Stripes of France, the of
ficial soldier publication over there, graph
ically describes a scene witnessed by the
writer of German prisoners being placed
in their cages at the rear of a recent battle
field. There were some eighty of
them, and they were unmercifully guying
one of their own officers who had been
taken along with the rest before he could
get away from his rear rank position. These
prisoners were postiviely cheerful over the
opportunity afforded of telling this Prus
sian lieutenant just what they thought of
him and his little ways and his present hu
miliation. Incensed at the jests and sar
casms he suddenly drew a pistol he had
concealed on his person and fired at an Eng
lish officer in charge of this particular
cage. The Englishman was not mortally
wounded and, in his turn drew and fired on
the Prussian, killing him. The German
prisoners shouted with joy over the grew
some incident.
The Abbe Wetterlee in his recent book,
"Behind the Scenes in the Reichstag,"
throws a light upon a most interesting
phase of German character and trend of
thought and ambition in the days just be
fore the great war. The abbe contends and
declares that the unspeakable German
crown prince was immensely popular with
the military and the masses and the '
politicians at that time; more so
than his father, even, because of his
well known war views and inordinate
noisy ovations every time he appeared in
public. While on the other hand the kaiser,
who was believed to be too peaceful and
tame, was given scant attention by the
masses of war-mad and proud German citi
zens. Thus saith the abbe. Wonder how
those crown prince worshipers and shout
ers feel now as they draw their belts to the
hunger notch and mourn their dead and
view the close-coming of black disaster.
An American congressman recently re
turned from France declares that American
soldiers are not giving quarter to German
machine gunners who stay and serve their
guns until the very last and then advance
with uplifted hands and cry, "kamrad."
And this is as it should be. Why should
these devils be allowed to lurk under cover
and pour a stream of death into advancing
Americans, each gunner it may well be,
killing from ten to sixty soldiers, and then,
having done their very worst, surrender and
go serenely to a comfortable prison camp?
If they elect to fight to a finish, let it be a
finish. The Americans are bayoneting
these fellows at their guns without qualm
or mercy. More power to them!
Senator Vardaman of Mississippi, a
wild-eyed pacifist of the militant type of
opposition to his government, was defeated
for nomination, but Senator Norris of Ne
braska, a republican and a woolly type of
a Iamblike pacifist, unfortunatly, was the
winner in his state primary. Still the Ne
braskans beat William J. Bryan's brother
for the democratic nomination and thus of
fer a real American against Norris for the
November election. Nebraska may yet be
free from the taint and blight of the politi
cal pacifist.

One of the greatest military critics of the
present war declares that in the present
fighting ground taken by the allies west of
the old 1 Jindenburg line counts for nought.
I le maintains that only the capture of pris
oners, guns and material count for any
thing in the list of real successes. We can
begin to gleat over ground captured when
we occupy positions east of tin: 1 linden
burg line. Sounds practical and full of
common tcn:c, whn you come to consider
it.
TOMHsTOXE. Aug. 26 Forty draft
ed men from Cochise county left
Tombstone at 4:30 this afternoon
midst cheers of the people of Torao
stone, in a special car provided for
that purpose by the local board, the
men having reported to Secretary Kay
Krebs yesterday afternoon.
They were allowed to so as they
pleased until this morning when they
reported again for instructions.
In honor of the boys who were lead
ing, a dance was given last night at
Cape Hall, which was attended by a
larte number of people, and accord
ing fo reports the boys were shown a
rood time, upholding the reputation of
Trmbstnne for the send-offs to the
drafted men who have entrained In
this city. .
The boys go to ("amp Pike. Ark.,
where they will go into training.- On
the special car in which they wi'l
travel until they get Into camp, the
bi vs have virtually littered both sides
vi'h parasraphs such as "Cochise

ninchers will get thern. Watch 'em."
To one slater 1n Mexico, danger.
All sharp-shooters." "JS.OO a mudVdig
kct will gtt the kaiser." "It's a long
way to Iierlin. but we will get there.''
If you get there before we do, you'll
have to go some." The car was labeled
in big chalk marks, '"From Cochise
county, Arizona, to Renin, via Camp
Pike."
Over one window was written the
"Famous Four" Monohan. Thompson,
Ptetsrn and Maddern, of Bisbee.
Rofore the train pulled out boxes
filled with candy, cigars and cigar

Clerk A. C. Karger of the hoard of
supervisors handed out soldier hallo's
to the drafted men who left today for
Camp Pike, and they will vote in the
Primary of September l'th, according
to tiie soldier voting law. An opinion
rendered some tinio ago in Maricopa
county held that the soldiers suffrage
law would be omplied with in intent
by pr'stnting each with a ballot be
fore their departure for camp.
The law states that ballots must be
mailed to soldiers not less than 40
days before the date of the primary,
but makes no provision for those who
leave for amn within that 40-day pe
riod. The opinion held th.it the pro
visions or the law were aimed at se
curing for the drafted soldier the right
to vote and the manner in which the
ballot was given to the soldier was of
secondary importance. It states that
it would be legal for the county re
corder to present personally, to each of
the men leaving, a primary ballot, and
the same ruling will apply to conting
ents which leave before the primary.

Secretary Gallatin, a firm opponent of
internal taxation, prevailed to such an
extent 'during the second war with
England, that only the smallest share
of the revenue needed to finance that
struggle was the result of the tax sys
tem inauagurated by Alexander Ham
ilton. At the last moment Gallatin decided
for levying an internal tax and made
this recommendation to congress. He
told congress that in refusing to grant
a renewal of charter to the I'nited
States bank, the government had lost
the source from which it had been
able to borrow monev most remlilv

had to think only of fighting, where
as the British had both fighting and
bombing to attend there. The odds
were all on the German side, but the
British aviators reached Mannheim
and did their Job. .
Newspaper editorials point out that
the bombing was well worth the risk,
for Mannheim is the center of the
great chemical industry, and the raid
is believed to have done damage
which will compel the German armies,
for a time at least to do without sup
plies of war chemicals from that quar
ter. The British aviators did not suffer
without hitting back, the newspapers
also point out, for three German fight
ing planes were beaten down.
Officially It is noted that the Ger
mans are making most determined ef
forts to protect their towns by concen
trating large numbers of fighting ma
chines and anti-aircraft guns. Com
menting on the raid, a British air of
ficer said today:
"We suffered losses, but we won a
splendid victory. We set out to bomb
Mannheim and no German efforts
could frustrate our intention."
ized from internal taxation was about
$18,000,000, but as the total cost of
the war was $180.oiin.ooo. it may read
ily be seen how small was the part the
Internal revenue system played in
meeting this obligation.

WANTS TO FIGHT FOR
UNCLE SAM BUT
NOT FOR MEXICO
WARREN DISTRICT YOUTH OF
MEXICAN PARENTAGE ESCAPES
FROM MEXICAN GUARDS AT
NACO AND REPORTS READY
FOR SERVICE
Charles C. Vega, was born in the
Warren district but of Mexican par
entage, had a narrow escape from be
ing forced into the Mexican army to
fight against the Y'aquf Indians and
from being listed as a deserter from a
call of the national army of the United
States and the Cochise county local
board listing him as having evaded the
draft.
The facts are as follows: The rirst
working on Sacramento hill, decided
that he wanted to pay a visit to friends
in Naco, Sonora, he states that he re
ceived a passport and that night, wliiU
attending a dance in that town, lost
it. He was picked up by the captain j
of the guard there and was held !n
cuminicado for five days. He was
held in a house by a guard camping '
about, composed of twenty-four men. t'
He was informed by the captain of tiie
guard that lie was going to be sent
to the Mexican army at Hermosillo io
fight against the Yaqui Indians. He
protested and stated that he wds an
American citizen and that he was born
in the United States and that he could
prove it if given a chance to call i.p
Bisbee on the phone or be allowed to
sent a letter out. He was denied this
and was told that they knew him and
that he was Jose Vesa and that he
had been a member of the Vil a army
and that they could prove it.
Friday night twenty men of the
guard were called down to the line
and he was lert with four guards about
the house, he pretended to be asleep,
and about 2 o'clock in the morning
he discovered that they were all asl?ap
so he stole out and succeeded in mak
ing his way across the line and bavk
to Bishop. He arrived here Satur
day morning late, after wa'king all
the way irom a point about two miles
east of Naco, where he had crossed
the line.
Sunday, while he was reading ;ue
Review, as he reads English, he saw
that his name was in the list to re
port to the local Cochise county board
to leave for Camp Kearny on Septem
ter 5. He at once reported to offi
cers in this city that lie was ready
to o, but wanted to go to Doming for
a day or so to visit his father there
and ether relatives in Tyronne, N. M.
He had not received his card as yet
calling him to go, but stated that he
would be back here on next Monday
morning to report, that he was willing
o fight for the United States, but
that he did not intend to fight for
the Mexican government as that was
i.ot his country, fort that the United
States was. He drew what little time
he had coming from the company yes.
terday and left last night on his way
to see his relatives before returning
and joining the forces of the United
States.

Seems Like the Skin Is on Fire.
There is a harrassinff discomfort
caused by Eczema that almost be
comes a torture. The itching is al
most unbearable, and the skin seems
n fire with the burning' irritation.
A cure from local applications of
salves and ointments is impossible,
because such treatment can only al
lay the pain temporarily. The disease
can only be reached by going deep
dtwn to its source.
The source of Eczema ii ia the
blood, the disease being caused by an
infection which breaks out through
the skin. That is why the most satis
factory treatment for all so-callej
skin diseases is S. S. for this rem
