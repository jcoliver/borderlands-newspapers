These seven men and others will be known some day as the pioneers
in the Arizana oil fields. Whether their judgment has been good In
coming to the front and stating their belief that oil can be produced in
commercial quantities in the Chino Valley Oil Fields, is to be demon
strated. If in their judgment they believe it can be developed, and there isn't
any of these men who would allow their name to be used if they did
.not believe it sincerely, the public should back them with their "bit."
The public of Arizona will back, and are backing any earnest endeav
or to drill for oil in the Chino Valley Oil fields where oil has already
been discovered.
If you don't think there is any excitement on the oil situation in Ari
. . ozna, read the Jerome papers, the Prescott papers. Already rigs are
going up. Already relinquishments on oil lands are selling for a pre
mium. There is a boom coming. Hundreds of companies will be or
ganized and OIL WILL BE STRUCK IN CHINO VALLEY.

Mexican Death
Head Troop Is
At Juarez Now
(By Review Leased Wire)
EL PASO, Tex., Nov. 30. The mili
tary situation in Chihuahua state as
sumed a new phase ytsierday with the
arrival of General Francisco Murguia
and his main column which be took
with him to Coahuila.
With him was the famous "Death
Head Troop" which was admitted by
Villa followers at Ojinaga to have been
the hardest fighting command they ev
er encountered. The arrival of Mur-
! guia was the causae for open rejoicing
in Juares last night
Because t bis aggressive tactics.
General Murguia is expected to take
the field at once and assume the of
fensive against Villa and band. Gen
e5ral Hernandez, who was forced to re
turn to Chihuahua City after his brief
campaign againsta Villa, will probably
' be left in control there and eGneral
Murguia will take his entire column
of 3.00 men into the field with him.
If Villa follows his former tactics, he
will re '.ire to the mountains for the
present leaving Murguia in rtmtrol of
the state. However, Villa sympathiz
ers here insist that Villa is now head
ing a new movement which, they claim
is nation wide and that he will meet
Murguia in the open as he offered to
do personally several months ago.
Parisians Will
Live On Rations
(By Review Leased Wire)
PARIS, Nov. 30. The cabinet today
approved of the measure of Victor Eo
ret, minister of provisions, regulating
the distribution of bread. Closer re
strictions have become necessary be
cause of insufficient harvests and the
limitations of tonuage for importa
tions. The basic principle of the new ra
tioning is that none except agricultur
alists consuming their own crops may
have a greater ratfon than the soldiers
at the front. Individual bread cards
will be established for towns of more
than 20,000 population and the state re
quisitions all cereals.
Bread will continue to be sold by
weight, but the form and weight may
vary. Fancy bread may be sold by
the piece, but it must be made of the
same flour as the ordinary article and
differ only in form and the manner of
baking.
Pastry shSps will continue to close
two days of each week and must not
use bread flour. Pastry cooks and con
fectioners are forbidden to sell any
thing for consumption in their shops
and bakers are forbidden to bake or
sell pastry.
Restaurants, hotels, tea houses and
similar establishments are ftrbidden
to make or sell pastries or cakes. Res
taurants where meals cost more than
four francs must not serve a customer
with more than 100 grammes, about
one-fifth of a pound, at each meal. The
cheaper restaurants tarf serve 300
grammes.

Lansdowne Is
Denounced
(Continued From Page One.) I
"The most important thing to say
in regard to Lansdowne's letter,";
Lord Robert said, "that he spoke only ,
for himself. Before writing it he did:
not consult or have any communica-j
tion with any member of the govern-1
ment, and the members of the gov
ernment read the letter in the news-,
papers with as much surprise as any-,
body else. j
Not England's Views
"It does not represent our views, I
nor has there been any change or
modification in the slightest degree1
in the war policy of this country.;
Our policy Is still what it always has ;
been and as described by the author-1
ized spokesmen of the country, name-:
ly, Premier Lloyd-George. Asquith, ;
Bonar Law and Balfour. It has been
put in different words by them, but;
perhaps is best summed up In the.
recent utterance of Premier Clenien
ceau that the war aim for which we
are fighting Is victory."
Regretted Everywhere
The letter of the Marquis of Lans-j
downe continues to be deprecated or
frankly denounced in all governmen-;
tal quarters. J. Austen Chamberlain,:
former secretary for India, in a speech j
at Northampton tonight, said that hej
and his colleagues, both In and out;
of office, viewed the letter with un-
feigned regret. It was unfortunate:
and inopportune, because at present j
moment, when Italy and Rumania'
were invaded and Russia was in the
throes of revolution, nothing ought!
to be said or written that will throw j
doubt on the loyalty of Great Britain!
to her allies. Mr. Chamberlain also!
declared that there must be no re-j
strlctlons of the rights of the bellig-'
erents at sea, such as Great Britain
had exercised and the United States
now was exercising. j
Liberals Wait American Opinion I
Although at present the attacks ,
against the Marquis of Lansdowne
are mostly vocal, there appears to be!
a considerable body of liberal opinion !
which w eleomes his letter and much j
interest is being exhibited in what'
the press of the United States has to,
say on the subject. There also is a !
great deal of curiosity as to what
support the Marquis, of Lansdowne
may have had among the political,
leaders, it being believed that he
was not likely, to publish such an!
appeal without some such acquies-,
cence. According to some rumors.;
Earl Loreburn, former lord high .
chancellor, and the Earl of Rosebury
were consulted before the letter was
given to the press. . i
The Weekly Nation expresses the'
opinion that the war policy of Vis-j
count Grey, former foreign secretary.'
is identical with the Marquis of Lans-'
downe's views.
An interesting point of view of
some of the political discussions bear-,
ing on the letter is that it points to
a possible alternative government and
policy to that of the existing govern
ment. The Marquis of Lawnsdowne was In
terviewed by the Daily Express con-'
cernlng his letter and said :
"I should like it known positively
that the letter was entirely my own. I ,
consulted nobody about it. An ab
surd idea has been spread that the sug
gestion was made by other people. I
wish to deny that." i
Lord Lansd'jwne declined to discuss
the opportuneness of the letter or the
possible effect in discouraging people
concerning the purpose and prospects
of the war and added:
'I have really nothing to add or re-;
tract and can hardly allow myself to
be catechized about It- The subpect
is necessarily tt'j controversial."

FOOD SITUATION IS
GROWING SERIOUS
SINCE U.S. EMBARGO
CHRISTIANIA. Nov. 30. (Corres
pondence of The Associated Press).
The food situation In Norway has
grown from bad to worse, especially
since the American embargo was Im
posed. So long as the commercial re
lations t'ould be maintained between
Norway and the United States, the im
port of food was about big enough to
meet the consumers' demand. Except
for the steadily increasing prices of
all articles of food everything could be
bought a before, the jnly form of ra
tioning being sugar which could only
be bought from government stores two
pounds at a time.
As a matter of fact, the government
and especially the food minister had
been too optimistic. When cable
grams from Washington staled that
the American government was going
to place an embargo on different ar
ticles the answex from the Norwegian
government to the press, asking how
this would affect Norway, was that it
only meant that Norway should guar
antee that nothing would be re-exported
t'j Germany, and then Norway
would get all it needed.
At last, during the la.st two months
it has dawned on the government that
Uncle Sam means business and that
Norway cannot expect special favors
as a favorite friend.
After the impor.ation of grain and
flour stopped the government estab
lished a grain mouoply taking charge
of all grain imported and produced
here. The farmers are not allowed to
sell their crops to anyone but the gov
ernment and at a fixed price. The
nation will be put on flour and bread
rations, every person, adult or child,
being allowed 25 pounds of bread
monthly, or 16 pounds of unsifted flour.
The people, however, are instructed
to mix potatoes in the bread dough.
With this year's crop and the imported
grain in storage, Norway has enough
flour till February or March. It is
hoped here that ihe Cdited States will
grant export licenses for some of tbe
grain bought there by Norwegian im
porters and the Norwegian govern
ment which now is ready for shipment.
Norway is dependent on imported
sugar as no sugar is produced here.
The consumption of sugar is still un
limited. Candy factories turn out as
much candy as before and no sugar
card is in use here, as in Sweden.
Last summer an ordinance was pass
ed putting motor vehicles and motor
craft on ratfons of gasoline. The re
sult was that automobiles were used
more freely than ever. The American
embargo again forced the authorities
to action and the sale of gasoline for
use in private cars was entirely stop
ped beginning October 1. Taxicabs
were only permitted to operate from
6 a. m. to 8 p. m. and the streets in the
city are now as quiet and free fi'Jin
noise as they were twenty years ago.
The supply of kerosene is becoming
very low with no prospect of replace
ment. For fishers this is disastrous
as all along the coast they are using
kerosene-driven motor boats. The
country population and the poor peo
ple in the cities using kerosene for
light and cooking are bard hit, as ev
ery family is only allowed two gallons
a month. '
The scarcity of fat is felt more and
more every day. The majority of tbe
population have been using margarine
instead of butter, but now that the raw
stuffs lor this product are not allowed
to be exported from the United States,
the margarine production is reduced
every week. Grocers have been forc
ed to put their customers on allow
ance, nobody receiving more than a
pound at once. Norway is facing a fat
shortage and the nation will have t'J be
rationed.
As for fuel, the people are put on ra
tions, except those who can take care
of themselves and afford to pay the
prices for coal and coke imported from
Great Britain.
Everybody asks, "why does not the
government entirely stop exports if
thereby more favorable importing
conditions can be established with the
allies?" But no official answer is
given.
MEXICAN GUNBOAT
FIRED ON FISHERMEN
(By Review Leased Wire.)
SAN PEDRO. Cal., Nov. 30. Protest

with customs officials by Antone Zan

west coast of Lower California.
He said tbe gunboat fired scores of
shots during a. chase which began
while he was fishing outside the three
mile limit and lasted several hours.
Captain Zankich and his brother re
cently applied for a license to fish
within the three mile limit, he said but
were refused.

Saturday Morning, December 1, 1917.
Great Britain is contributing $3,000 a day to the sup
port of her Y. M. C. A. work in the different fields.
The weather man reported it was ilve below in Michi
gan one morning this week. And still the Arizona skies
smile with summer brightness to warm the chill of the
nights and the snap of the mornings away.
Whether to raise a few billion next year by bond issue
or additional taxation will be the great problem the next
congress will have to solve. Both plans have- their ad
vantages. Either methoJ will result the same the peo
ple must pay.
Cleveland H. Dodge's message to the people: "The
time has come when men and women of means can no
longer satisfy their consciences by giving only a portion
of their incomes to the great causes indispensable to our
government in the prosecution of the war. All the in
comes left after paying living expenses and taxes must
go, and in addition safe deposit boxes must be opened
and big slices cut into the principal."
Seven hundred girls ct the Kansas State Agricultural
college, through Miss Elizabeth Wadley. a student, have
asked for the names of seven hundred soldiers, so that
each girl could remember one on Christmas. "We can't
do very much," Miss Wadley told Lieut A. A. Werner,
statistical officer, "but all the gfri know how to bake
good cake and pies and make good candy. The girls near-
i
ly always, have a little spare time on their hands each
day, and they can knit wristlets and heavy socks, because
the boys will need them this winter."
The situation in Russia seems to be like this: Lenine,
the German agent, holds the seat of government and
issues the proclamations and speaks In a German tongue
as one having authority. The bulk of the people are
scared half to death. The radicals and anarchists are
all running wild. The soldiers under arms are up in the
air. General Kaledines, head of the United Cossacks,
the real fighter? of the nation, is still anti-German, and
he has the nation's gold reserve and grain fields and
warehouses under his hand. Who will prevail in the end?
Many things have conspired to keep Bisbee below the
average in size this past week and In the amount and
quality of its local reailing matter. In the first place
local advertising has been light to the point of funeral
sadness. A national holiday did its part. The telegraph
editor is on a vacation and a reporter is in attendance
at court in a neighboring city. As a climax painters came
and took possession of the editorial rooms and one has
to write in a No Man's Land of debris and with a gas
mask on. Quite a tale of woe, friends and brethren.
Congressman Harden: "I feel proud of the manner in
which Arizona has responded to the call to arms for de
fense in this war and proud of the manner in which the
people have come forward in meeting every call made
upon them in the matter of gelling Liberty bonds, aiding
the Red Cross and helping the Y. M. C. A. war work
endeavor and in every other way. I understand that Co
chise county has "gone ever the top" in answr to every
call and that Douglas a'one bought more of the second
Litterty bond issue than was apportioned to fie entire
county and that Bishce bought more than Tlouglas, send
ing the total to three million dollars to meet an appor
tionment of i,118,000.
British casualty lists snow 120.000 men killed, wounded
or missing for November. It Is a tremendous total. The
French lost almost as many and the Germans and Italian!
certainly more for the month. That means a half millior
men for the month. Other wars that have lived dor
through the ages as terrible epochs of blood and slaughter
were mere feu'l compared to this struggle. This month's
casualty list exceeds t!i:it of either side during the four
years' struggle of the Ciil war, and that was regarded
as the bloodiest war of modern times. uuIcks Napoleon's
wars lie excepted. At Lcipsfr, Napoleon's most costly
battle. It Is estimated that nearly 2f0.0"fl men fell. Three
times tbut nmuler sleep at Ypres. and probably four
titut'c as many full at Verdun.
PEACE TERMS TO RUSSIA.
The following are the kaiser's terms of peace to Rus
sia as reported by those close to the intimate channels of
information:
Poland to be independent under Teutonic "protection."
Austria to get an indemnity from Russia.
Bulgaria to get Dobrudja and to control the mouth of
the Danube for Austrian and German "commercial pur
poses." Turkey to regain all the territory overrun by Russian
troops and to be accorded trade routes to Persia and the
Caucasus previously held by Russia.
Britain is spending thirty-three millions a day on the
war. This is her highest mark. She has spent sixteen
billions already. Germany, it is estimated, has spent
twenty-three billions without counting. her loan; to her
allies. Bankruptcy stares the German empire squarely
in the face, even though the kaiser might get peace to
morrow. Two years hence he will face a debt that it is
impossible to contemplate without a shudder for the con
sequences. No wonder he promised his people that Ameri
ca should pay an indemnity that would go far towards
canceling his war debts. And America will pay in shot
and steel and shell.
A Bisbee man cast about for some time in his mind
as to the beet Christmas present to send bis old mother
back borne in New York state. And what do you think
he finally decided upon? Twenty pounds of sugar; no
more, no less. He bought the sugar in Bisbee without
any particular strain except the raising of the two dol
lars. The last word he had from the old home was that
they had had no sugar ir. the house for three weeks and
that it was impossible to buy it on the market. Effete
New York, center of cemmerce and wealth, is out of
sugar, but the wild and wooly west still uses two heaping
spoonfnIl8 in its coffee ind it able to send a little back
to the home folks as a Christmas token.
Rippling Rhymes
(By WALT MASON.)
THE CHEERFUL MOTORIST
I crawl beneath my balky car, with
fifteen kinds of wrenches, ajid tin
ker where its vitals are, 'mid gas and
grease and stenches. When done I
am a sight to see, a sight for sore-eyed
dragons; and passing horses shy at
me. run off and bust their waning. I
skid into a muddy ditch, and hail some
passing granger, to bring bis mutes
along and hitch, and haul me out of
danger. I wallow round in squashy
mire, cold rain upon me drizzling, re
moving from the wheel a tire, and use
some language sizzling. Sometimes
the lamps won't shed a ghost or thtir
accustomed splendor, and then 1 run
in IV) a post and break a costly fender.
A farmer stops me now and thei., ana
asks me, in his dander, to pay for run
ning down his hen, his sheepdog or nls
gander. O'er arid hills I jaunt along,
through meadows cool and ferny, and
something's always going wrong, wher
ever I may journey. But when I moto
honie again, - from my adventures
shocking, and mingle with familiar
men, you ought to hear me talking! "I
had the finest time," I yip. while truth
grows vague and hazy; "no accident
on all the trip my car is suu a
daisy!"
For several weeks the German general staff has known
that part of the western front was held by American
troops; in fact, has captured some of them. But the
silly American censor, with his bead in the sand like au
ostrich, will not let the correspondents abroad send any
real news about our forces. Only foolish and inconse
quential items are allowed to pass. It is like the old story
that every newspaper reporter knows so well of when a
house is robbed or a man is killed and the chief of police
refuses to give any particulars to the press for publica
tion for fear the guilty wretch will be put on his guard
as a result The Germans who are fighting Pershing's
men know where they are stationed; why should not
the American public know?
Grand news! The Rainbows are in France. Citizen
soldiers from every state in the union are in that magic
land where so many brave men have fought and died and
won immortal names. Consider for a moment: More
United States soldiers are now in France with arms in
their hands than Washington had in all his armies during
the Revolution. We have sent more men abroad to fight
with the English'than England sent here to fiht us during
the entire war of 1812. General Pershing now has a
larger army than Napoleon had at Waterloo. No figures,
of course, are given out by the war department, but it
is pretty well known tl at over 130,000 men are in
France with U. S. A. shining on their belt buckles. And
we do not call themian army at ali in this war; merely
i.n expeditionary force. It will be the middle of next
summer before we have an army "over there."
In New York the other night police stopped the soldier?
from dancing after a party at which they were guesti
and some woman's society the hostesses. It seems there
is a law in the state that prohibits soldiers from dancing
in the armories. The rules and regulations and restrio
tions against the enlistel men are so many and cover so
many things and are increasing so fast that the poor sol
dier boy will soon have to sit and suck his thumbs when
he is not drilling or working in camp. Under the inten
sive training methods of today the soldier must work
like a truck horse. ' In battle he has the machine gun tc
face with its deadly stream. Seems like the present ad
ministration is overdoing the regulation business in the
navy and army. The man who fights hard, plays bard
They cannot take all his play away and have much fight
left
During the Soinnie offensive a year axo last spring
the British battled for three weeks for Delvillc wood.
But in the end they took it and drove the Germans steadi
ly back and buried the German dead by the thousand.
They are fightinp the same way today for Bourlon wood.
In the end they will take it, maybe in a day; maybe in
three weeks. It is the British way. They fight always
to a finish. In that same Somme offensive tliey struggled
for a month before the Germans yielded Conible. Von
Hindenburg sacrificed thousands upon thousands of his
picked troops in a suorenie effort to save that village.
But the British crowded up close and actually took that
bloody town by inches. They are fighting that same way to
day for Fontaine. And they will take It. The German resist
ance here merely swells the number of the German dead
that must be buried by the British as they press on. For
a week; even three of them, the German is a g'Hid fighter
at the hand-to-hand gain:, but as the iliiys wear ou he be
gins to falter and lose his strength and skill. The liritish
soldier gets lietter as the flubt continues. In trench
fighting the German is good the year 'round, and he
never reems to grow tired of the mud and ditch fame.
But three weeks of a steady diet of the bayonet turns
the Bocae btuuiav't and, he quit 10I4.
STATE DIRECTOR PICKS
CHAIRMAN TO HEAD
THE THRIFT WORK
With the appointment of a chair
man in every county of Arizona to

sta?e was sent the following tele
gram notifying them of their appoint
ment as agents for the sale of war
savings certificates and stamps:
"Your bank has been appointed by
Secretary of the Treasury McAdoo nr
ngent for sale of war savings certifi
cates and stamps. You can purchase

plies. Sale opens December 2.
"HARRY R. TRITLE,
State Director or War Savings for
Arizona."
Ity this thrift campaign it Is pr:
posed by the government to raise $2,
000.000,000 bv appealing directly to
the people to invest in war savings
certificates. People who were unable
to assist in the Liberty loans, even
through the low installment plan, will
have a chance under the plan of this
thrift campaign to loan monfy to the
government o help win the war by
buying stamps at 25 cents each.
Ttfese stamps will be placed on sale
on December ''. and a sounder invest
ment is impossible to secure. A few
pennies invested every day in these
stamps will speedily roll themselves
up. thanks to the compounding of the
interest, into a substantial sum in
dollars, and each investor ran enjoy
he pleasing satisfaction of feeling
that, he is doing something lo help the
brave boys at the front.
Let the idle pennies work.
GOVERNOR CAMPBELL
VETOES PLAN TO
STOP ROAD WORK
Work on the highways and. bridges j
of Arizona should not be discontinued .
during the war, but should be actively
prosecuted, according to Governor !
Thomas E. Campbell in a communica-'
tion to Thomas Madtfrck, state en-,
gineer. i
Governor Campbell declares that in i
his judgment there should be no cessa
tion in the proper maintenance of the
highways of the state until the price
of road material reaches a prohibitive
figure. The surplus of labor in the
mining camps also could be well util- !
ized in I'oad work, the governor de-'
clares. j
Following is the letter of the gov-:
ernor to State Engineer Maddock : 1
November 28, 1917. i
My Dear Mr. Maddock:
Replying to your communication of ,
October 19, embracing the subject of i
state highway activities' during the
course of "jur present war: j
After mature consideration of the j
same, u is my juugmeui, iu uue wiui
the policy consistenly annunciated by
me, that the work on state highways
and bridges should be actively prose
cuted and that roads, now part of the
state highway system, should be main- j
tained and improved to the highest de-
gree 'of utilization by the traveling pub
lic. Until such time as material and
labor have reached the point in cost, 1
where the former is carried beyond our ,
ability to purchase the same at reason
able, average war prices and the latter ,
has been enlisted in the several de
partments of military activities or in
dustrial pursuits, let us keep on at our .
present rate of momentum. ;
From information received,-1 believe :
that, at the present time, there is a
surplus of lab'or in several of our min
ing districts, part of which we can ab
sorb for use in state highway work. It
is my desire that as much of this labor
as can be economically absorbed be
employed. !
I wish you to understand that I ap-'
predate the spirit which impelled you
to bring this most important sugges-.
tion IV) my attention, and shall be glad :
to bear that you. as the head of one
of the most important of the depart
ments of the state, will be glad to pur-,
sue with diligence and satisfaction, the
policy herein outlined.
Sincerely,
THOMAS E. CAMPBELL,
Governor.

The process of heating water for domestic purposes has been rev

a problem to secure an abundance of hot water quickly and econo
mically, in any dwelling, large or smalL
Today, in the countless thousands of homes where gas fired water heaters are in
stalled, an abundance of hot water is available for any purpose. By some types of heat
ers the water is heated instantly at the turn of a faucet, by others, within a few min
utes after lighting the heaters, and all without labor, inconvenience or discomfort, ind
at a reasonable cost for gas.

As the session progressed the market ;

thoughtful considerations, along with
a repudiation or Lord Lansdowne's

i Hie result that initial losses in great

of the actual property loss from the
great floods which have swept over
Mirth China within the last two;
months and finally engulfed this city in .
an inland sea which threatens to re-1

Chinese government railways have
already expended several millions of
dollars in repairing damages. The
Peking-Hankow Railway is now able
to handle through business between
the two cities by the use of a ferry
across the Puto river.
The railway connecting Tientsin and
Shanghi suffered less loss than the !
Hankow railway, but the first thirty (
miles of the line south of Tientsin is

days under the direction of Roger S.
Greeue, the director in China of the
Rockefeller Foundation. It consists
of 1.000 model one-room huts, each of
whirh is capable of housing a family
of five. Relief camps have been hasti-;
