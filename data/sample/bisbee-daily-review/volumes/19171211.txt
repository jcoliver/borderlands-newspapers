THE RIGHT OF

Supreme Court Declares That
Operators May Prevent
Conspiracies to Bring Non
Union Men Into Unions.
(By Review Leased Wire)
Wi
ASHINGTON. Dec. 10. Deci
sions defining in general terms
the rights of both organized
.labor and the employer tvera an
nounced by the supreme court today.
While the right of workmen to organ
ize for lawful purposes was reaffirm
ed, the court held that employers le
gally may operate their plants as
"open plants" and prevent conspira
cies to bring their non-union employes
into labor organizations.
The opinions were made in the
cases of the Hitrhman Coal and Coke
company and the Eagle Glass Manu
facturing company of West Virginia,
the court deciding that both were en
titled to operate their plants as "open
shoos," and upholding injunctions is

spiracies in restrain of trr" were
ignored by the Kupreme cou-. opin
ion. In Hitchman Case.
In the Hitchman case the mojority
of the court held that the officials of
the miners' union "deliberately and
6Jv!sediy selected that method of en
larging the union membership which
wouU inflict injury" upon the com
pany and its loyal employe and de
clared that the conduct in so doing
was "unlawful and malicious." The
court also declared that "it is erron
eous to assume that all measures
which may be resorted to in the effort
to unionize a mine are lawful if they
are peaceable that is if they stop
short of physicial violence or coer
cion through fear of it."
Coercion Unlawful.
It added that "the purpose of the
defendants to bring about a strike at
the mine in order to compel plaintiff,
through fear of minancial loss, to con
sent to the unionization of the mine as
the lesser evil was an unlawful pur
pose." Three Disent.
The court divided in the Hitchman
case, six to three. Justices Brandeis.
Holmes and Clrjr'k dissenting. No
formal dissenting opinion was an
nounced, except a brief statement
made by-Justice Brandeis who said he
believed the union had a right to do
the things to which the other mem
bers of the court objected.
Contempt proceedings instiuted laet
month by the Hitchman Coal and
Coke company against Prerident
Frank J. Hayes of the miners' union
and 15 other officials and members
for alleged violations of the injunc
tion, are pending and, according to
the company's counsel, will be press
ed. The court today granted the de
fendants 60 days in which to present
their case.
Gompers Criticize Decision.
Today's opinion was characterized
in a statement issued tonight by Pres
ident Samuel Gompers of the Ameri
can Federation' of Labor, as "far
reaching and unwarrantable." He
said through John Mitchell, former
president, and William B. Wilson, for
mer secretary-treasurer of the miners'
international union, are stigmatized
as conspirators. Despite the opinion,
he declared, the work of organizing
the workmen of the country in order
to "reach our goal for better concept
of not only political, but industrial
democracy," will oontinue unabated.
Defend Union.
"To hold that the United Mines
Workers of America is an unlawful
organization or that it is a conspiracy
is to hark back to the doys when em
ployers were monarch of all they sur
veyed and their employes were serv
ants or slaves," Mr. Gompers' state
ment said. "The miners' union und
ertook by perfectly lawful methods
and mean?, to reach the unorganized
and underpaid miners of West Virgin
ia, so that they might be treated as
men and as citizens with responsibili
ty of maintaining families upon an
American standard.
"In its petition the Hitchman Coal
and Coke company did not have the
right to claim that there was any viol
ence or unlawful conduct on the part
of. the representatives of the union to
organize the coal miners.
Claims Wage is Low.
"The scale of wages paid the miner

HALIFAX. N. Dec. 10. A roar-j
ing blizzard, the third to strike this j
sorely afflicted city since the blast
from the exploding' munition steamer
made 25,000, persons homeless fourj
days ago. burst from the northwest j
late today. Raging with all the fury I
for which these northern winter'
storms are noted, it' all but crushed
the hearts of the brave band of work
ers struggling against overwhelming !
odds to alleviate suffering.
For a while contingents of the Cana
dian army toiled doggedly amid the
ice-shrouded ruins for the uarecover
ed dead but were obliged to withdraw.
Pungs bearing hospital supplies and
food to the numerous relief stations
were stormed - bound. The crippled
lighting system broke down' again,
leaving, the city in darkness.
Driven to Coper.
Burial parties who had volunteered
their sen-ices when the medical au
thorities announced that the recover
ed dead must be disposed of at once,
were driven to cover. From the devast.
ed arear hundreds of men and women
patiently seeking their dead gave up
their task and sought shelter. Re
list trains reaches the city, in the
height of the blizzard but the workers
found themselves helpless.
In tents, barracks, private homes
and public buildings, thfl 'homeless
have been given shelter. Reports from
the six thousand -wounded stated that
for thm at least the storm brought
no added danger, so well had they
been provided ror.
Housing is Question.
So serious is the problem of hous
ing -and feeding those already in the
city that a strict embargo was issued
tonight against the admission of all
persons not conne ted with relief or
reconstructive work. Military guards
were detailed to stop newcomers at
Truro. Among the first to reel this
stringent, but necessary step were
many Americans who were baited at
St. John.
The citizens and the authorities gen
erally recognize that the multitude
of visitors who have been flocking in
since railway communication was re
established are moved by the best
of intentions. The city appreciates
their generous desire to help. But
there are simply no accommodations
lor them. In a community of 65,000
inhabitants, 25,000 have been made
suddenly homeless. These must llrst
be provided for as well as the army
of workmen needed to clear away the
debris and rebuild the city.

The project is part of the regular
plan of the department, it is under
stood, for tbe tactical organization of
the expanded regular army.
Th-ire is no present intention of em
ploying mounted troops with General
Pershing's forces, although the gener
al slaft is reported to have recom
mended the creation of from three to
five cavalry divisions. Employment
by General Byng, leader of the recent
British surprise attack of mounted
trooo.f, points the way to the conclus
ion that it may be advisable later,
when the transportation is easier, to
send over cavalry in such numbers
as th4 American staff may think wise.
Should the German line be broken by
a drive in which American troops
participated, it is not to be doubted
that General Pershing would need
mounted forces to drive home his at
tack lr. the open country beyond.
It was emphasized that formation
of the cavalry division at El aso re
flected no uneasiness as to the border
situation. Winter has required the
withdrawal of the mounted troops
from the northern expansion camps.

about unification of the rail
roads during the war.
The fact lhat the president has de

situation with Senator Nes'.ands.
chairman of the sena.e interstate com
merce committee. He probauly will

delivered before the Chi is-mas holi
days.
Full Intentions Unknown
Indications tonight were tiwit tlv
president has confided to none or hi
associates his full intention and of
ficials were doub.ful as to just what
he may ask. Some were of th-j opin
ion that be might request action in
line with the suggestion ot the inter
state c'omemrce commission thai anti
trust and anti-pooling laws be sus
pended during the period of the ar.
Others pointed out that the coanp-n-e
commission's report also carried :!ie
suggestion that additional legis:ai:on
might be needed were the government
to decide to take over opera. ton of the
rads.
The "president's advisers are divided
in their views as to what is n?cesar'
to be tioriC Most of tnem. hoeer,
have come out for overn:ueat opera
tion and some 'jt the strcnj.-e.st stip-
; por:ers of this proposal declare the
executive already under the army ap
propriation act has power to take
over the railroads lor operation und-r
an administrator.
hTe position of the railiVads tufi
selves was set forth today in a )e'tr
to Senator Newlauds from Fairfax
Harrison, chairman of tbe railroad
board.
Position of Railroads
The railroads, Mr. Harri-ou de
clared, do n'Jt seek a repeal of any
legislation, believeing the co-operative
use of facilities recently put into ope
ration will bring about max. mum ef
ficiency. Neither do they fete a
lean from the governnent. he said,
though government aid is u.--keJ in ob
taining for them ou their 'own Individ
ual cn?di: new capital needed.
Further measures to make the resds
more efficient, Mr. Harrison suggest
ed, would be an increase in rates, pri
ority for transportation of new ma
terial, appointment of a traffic man
ager for government freight and ex
emption rrom the drart rjr railroad em
ployes. Oppose Federal Operation
The railroads' opposLicn to govern
ment operation is well understood
among officials who hare lllo.vcd the
situation, but some surprise was ex
pressed tonight at their objection to
suspension of provisions against pool
ing traffic and profits. In tbe opinion
jf many officials a complete co-ordination
of rail systems canno; be ac
complished unless the roads poo; their
traffic which of itself involves a pool
ing of profits.
Pooling Advantageous
The advantages iu pooling have
been pointed to as the chief argu
ment for government operation, since
Uie government directing the lines
could pool traffic without violating in
hibitions imposed n'Jw for the protec- .
tion of the public.
in its special report to congress,
made public a few days aeo, the inter
state commerce commission held out
two alternatives ror relief of the
transportation situatiou. One was the
suspension of an. i trust laws and the
other government operation. Com
missioner McChord in a supplementary
opinion. hk h it has been sa.d since
is approved by other members, em
phatically urged government operai.jn
as the only measure.
Administration Possible
Those within the government who
believe the railroads themselves can
handle the situation, if given free rein,
do no; oppose legislation to make full
pooling compulsory. If such a course
were pursued, they admit, it might be
advisable to name a government rail
road admilstrator who would see that
the wishes of the government were
carried out.
Before seeing the president today.
Senator Newlands held a conterence

board, at which Mr. Harrison's letter

FEDERAL FARM LOAN
BOARD RECOGNIZES
RAISEJH INTEREST
Board Increases Rates From
Five to Five and One-Half
Per Cent Private Sources
May Increase Their Rates.
WASHINGTON. D. C. Dec. 10. The
general upward movement f inter
est rates was recognized today by the
federal farm loan board by raising
the rate on government lo&us to form
ers from 5 to 5, per cent tn antici
pation of a later increase in the pres
ent 4i per cent rate on farm loan
bonds. Decision probably will be
reached tomorrow whether to raise ih&
bond interest rate a'- this time, or to
reduce the selling price, wnich here
tofore has been at a premium of 1
per cent.
In spite of the decision reached by
the farm loan board. Secretary Mc
Adoo said today he hoped future issues
of Liberty bonds would bear 4 per
cent, the same as the second I'Jnn.
' Private Rates Follow
One of the immediate effects of the
higher farm loan rate, it is expected,
will be to encourage a similar advance
of private mortgage loan rates on
land, which now range rrom td 2
per cent above the government loans.
Reports reached the treasury i'jday
that several insurance companies with
big loans on middle western farm
lands, had decided to make no new
loan, in order to keep assets liquid and
would refuse to renew many expiring
mortgages. . This it was pointed out,
would tend , to increase the cost of
available loans.
Business Gigantic
The farm fjan system has placed
nearly $30,000,000 in loans since it be
gan operations six months ago and ap-j
plications for $300.00Q.00 are pending.
Private loans outstanding on farm
lands in the entire country are esti
mated at nearly 14.000,000,000.
The new interest rate announced to
day will not apply to loans approved
by any ' of the farm !jan banks,
tt'jugli not actually completed.
DEATHS ON INCREASE
AT TRAINING GAMPS
WASHINGTON. Although health
conditions generally in the national
aimy and national guard camps show
ed improvement during the week" end
ing November 30th, the number of
deaths materially increased.
The report 'jf the division of field
sanitation made public today shows
there were 164 dea:bs .among the
guardsmen, as compared with 97 the
previous week and 79 among the draft
man, as against 60 the preceding wees.
One hundred and thirty-four of the
guardsmen and 29 of the draft men
died of pneumonia and nine of the
former and 15 of the latter died of
meningitis.
Only two divisions reported an in
crease in cases of measles and the
number was small. In the divisions
where there has been an epidemic of
measles the disease apparently has
been brought under control.
Reports from all but one of the di
visions show a decrease in the number
of new cases.

St
Wilson May Ask
Laws of Congress
To Unify Lines
(Continued From Page One.)
sion and the railroad war board, com
posed of railway executives, differ as
to the necessity of legislation in order
to mee: the urgent requirements or
the war. The Commission insists that
unification of operation shouldt be
conducted either by the carriers or by
the president.
"The railroads, on the other hand,
claim that there ia no necessity for
legislation; that the unification of the
j railways already arranged for under
! the railroad war board is pi'jeeeding
! successfully and will be further per-
fected ; that they do not ask for the
I repeal of the anti-trust and anti -pool-,
ing laws as relating to them; that
' they do not ask one billion dollars
; from the government or anybody else."
! Harrison's Letter
j Mr. Harrison's letter to Senator
! Newlands follows:
I "The American railroad system has
i not broken down. On the contrary it
1 has in recent months handled 60 per
' cent more business than in 1915 witta
jout material enlargement of plant.
I "Some misconception seems to ex-
is; as iv the immediate requirments
of the railroads in their present situa
tion. Their chief operating troubles
are a volume of traffic greater than
the capacity of the plants in certain;
limited territories, aggravated by ex
cessive use of preference orders, and
their now serious malady of 'dilu'Jon'
of labor, which is general throughout
the country and common to all indus
try. Nevertheless, the railroads under
present management are prepared to
lurnish all the transportation which
the existing plant can prouuee under
any form of management.
What Railroads Don't Ask
"I They do ask one bilhvm dollars
from the government or anybody else
at the moment; they could not imme
diately invest in plant and equipment
if they had it. because of the dif
ficulty in getting materials and labor.
That figure represents, in round fig-
I ures what ought to be spent in every
year for several years to bring the
American railroad plant up to capacity
handle efficiently the growing
traffic. About $600,000,000 per annum
on theaverage has been spent for a
number of years for road and equip
ment, which at present prices, would
be equivalent to about one billion dol-,
lars for road and equipment. j
"2. They do not, a; this time, ask
for repeal of the anti-trust andanti-1
lAoling laws as relating to them, for
they do not consider such relief in
uediately necessary to increase unifi
ed operations.
"The co-operative use of facilities
will be continued in such a way as to
obtain maximum efficiency.
The present system of voluntary
unification is adequate for this. No
interest has declined, or will decline,
.'jr selfish or other reasons, to respond
to the requirement of the present co
perative organization.
What the Railroads Do Ask
"3. The Immediate appointment of
a traffic officer to represent all im
portant departments in transporta
.ion matters with who mthe railroads
can deal, to secure active government
co-operation, the prompt and orderly
transportation of the government traf
fic and avoid the excessive use of
preference orders, which congest traf
fic instead of facilitating it
"4. Most of the railroads need more
locomotives, immediately and enougn
new cars to replace those worn out.
There are approximately 3.800 locomo
tives and 33,000 cars still on order
undelivered for American railroads.
The railroads expect to provide the
capital. Priority orders are essential
for delivery of such equipment.
"5. Approximately 5000 locomotives
and 150,000 cars, in addition to those
now on order, are necessary to meet
the requirments of next year. This is

ery year and at present prices repre
sent a cost of approximately $500,000,

are able to purchase their quotas of
such equipment without, aid. it is ap
parent that because the United States
has necessarily Occupied . the invest
ment market for war loans, as evi
denced by tne recent request of the
secretary of the treasury that no new
private financing shall be undertaken
without conferences with him, the rail
roads generally cannot next year pro
vide through their usual channels for
:he capital requirements for the ac
quisition of equipment and other pos
sible additions to plant' They invoke,
therefore, the co-operation and aid of
the ogevernment through the treasury
department and the federal reserve
board to secure for them, on their own
individual . credit, the new capital
found by the governerant to be neces
sary not only for nelargement of plant
but for renewing maturing obligations.

f Penny Pinching Not
It ai nr.,..- c
I have learned that the intelligent
housewife the woman schooled in really scien
tific domestic economy no longer throws away a nickel to
save a penny.
A good way to illustrate this point
would be through comparison of baking
powders.
Experience has taught mc and mill
ions of other women that it doesn't pay to buy
cheap baking powders. They cost a few cents less, but in the
long run they aredecidedly the most expensive. Because of
the low gride materials employed ia their manufacture they
cause many bake dzy failures and gTeat loss of expensive
ingredients. The housewife throws out, in wasted materials
many times the amount saved on the cost of the baking pow
der. This is not economy, bat extravagance. , .
True economy in hiking powder
demands the highest quality at the lowest price.
Only baking powders that rr.cst these demands should be
used. Only baking pcvvd?r lha; nsde of the highest class
ingredients so perfactly p oportioned that it not only produces
maximum leavening powsr but d.J Unserves it.
Besides, the baking powder that
meets the modern demand for economy should
be economical in use full rtrennh economical in cost
secured at a moderate rice.- The housswife should be able
to effect a saving when buying ?id another saving when
using and she shodd cavj materials it is usef with.
That is economy in its highest form.
Complete economy. The only kind of econ
omy the housewife chock! ;tsnipc ' - .
I have proved positively by exhaust
ive experiments and comparative tests that
Calumet Baking Puwder h beet sched to these savings. It
possesses the surety, the parity and 2odness that make .
constant employment of utmost baking economy possible.

ENORMOUS CORN CROP
WILL REDUCE PRICE
OF MEAT AND MILK
(Ily Review Leased Wire)
NEW YORK. Dec. 10. Lower prices
in meat, milk and other commodl.ies
as a result of tlie euormous crop 'of
corn which it is expected will be dis
tributed throughout the country ty
January 15tii. was forecast by Feder
al Food administrator Hoover in a
statement tonight. He declared that
this extraordinary crop is '"the certain
economic remedy for high prices."
Mr. Hoover attended several confer
ences here today at which the food
ituatlon was discussed with federal
and state officials. Plans to appoint
food administrators in every city and
county of New York state were form
ulated at tme of these meetings.
Mr. Hoover's statement said:
The real fundamental and eco
nomic relief is the coming of the corn
crop, the greatest crop we have known
in many years. It is now practically
four weeks behind time, due to many
causes. I expect that by January 15th
this great crop will have been started
on the way tt) the consumers through
the various channels.
"This crop is not tmly plentiful,
but will be sold at a reasonable price.
The cost of corn is dropping every day.,
n proportion to the cheapness of corn
fj the farmers we shall have reflected
lower prices of such commodities "as
milk and meat. One of the delays in
the movement of the corn crop has
been the shortage of cars.
"Corn is really one-half of our food,
and this extraordinary crop of ap
prtximately three and a quarter billion
bushels is the certain economic rem
edy for high prices."
As to the regulation of price of all
commodities by the government, Mr.
Htfjver said that either prices must be
regulated or there must be a continu
ous wage increase and added:
""In other words, wages must as
cend according to the prices of the
necessities of life. I mean that the
high cost of living must stop, or we
must have a continuous ascending
wage scale. A continuous increase in
wages usually undermines national ef
ficiency and of the two evils it is ev
ident we must make an efrort to regu
late the prices."

ed by Fc'od Administrator Hoover, po
licemen made their appearance and
"searched" for liquor "imported" into
District of Columbia in violation of
the Sheppard prohibition law, and the
many bottle "found" resulted in some
amusing explanations.
Use Airplane
As a means of presenting to the as
sembled company several jf the large
number of prominent men present, a
unique device was used. A miniature
airplane buzzed overhead the length
of the hall and after it disappeared be
hind the curt8!n two cabinet members
dressed as American aviators came
out. They declared that ' they sus
pected "camouflage" was being used
to hide some of the guests, who then
were introduced. Food Administrator
Hoover das described as "the man wh'j
has the world eaJng out of his
hands."
Sell Saving Stamps
Another novel feature was a sale of
war savings stamps conducted by
Frank A. Vanderlip of New York,
chairman of the treasury department,
and Henry Ford of Detroit, a member
of the cbmmtite. A big sum was real
ized. The dinner was brought to a clMse
with a spectacular pageant preceding
President Wilson's address.

Tuesday Morning, December 11, 1917. '
The mobilization of the. world's greatest civilian
"army' for service during the war is the purpose of the
big Red Cross membership campaign, to begin through
out the country December 17. ,
Sergeant Blinman, now in Bisbee as a recruiting offi
cer for the. British army, was one of the heroes of the
Messines Ridge battle.. Attention, friends! It is an honor
to salute this brave Britisher.
The increase of the United States army from 110,000
men in Aj.ril of this year to 1,300,000 at this time is a
great showing for the year. And the same increase will
have to ue made next year. England has three million
soldiers in France.
This is a meatless day. Are you going to observe It
like a good American and a good sport, or are you going
to be a hog about it and selfishly ignore the earnest ap
peal of your country to do your individual bit for the
soldiers who are fighting the Hun?
Every indication points to a lively and unhappy
Christmas for the Bolshevikl leaders. The Cossacks,
about the only fighters :n Russia nowadays, have started
a campaign against the traitors who are about to deliver
their country to the kaiser. Is it not strvge that the Cos
sack, regarded for centuries as the most cruel and dread
ed and powerful tool of autocracy, should now be the sole
hope of a real democracy in Russia?
It is declared in hign quarters that the danger of a
successful German offensive on the western front was
never greater than now. The allied appeal to America to
hurry has been more urgent of late, and oar government
5s speeding everything to the limit. No one doubts that
Germany will make one last effort to gain a decision be
fore America can place enough troops on the firing line to
offset her armies releasfd fium the Russian front.
While there is no particular military importance to
the capture of Jerusalem by British troops, it is glorious
news just the same, coming as it does Just before Christ
mas time.. Christ's city is restored to the Christians.
And there is a sentiment about It that tells powerfully
all over the Christian world against the German. For,
' be it understood, Jerusalem had to be wrested from Ger
many's ally, the unspeakable Turk. In other words, the
kaiser, with his hypocritical cant about God being with
him, has held, through his tool, Turkey, the Holy City for
the infidel and the heathen.
For the benefit of German sympathizers and citizens
of German birth or parentage who still favor the father- .
land over that of their adopted country, it might be well
to call attention at this time that the German government
is paying fifty cents a day for workers in the coal mines.
Skilled labor in Germany receives eight dollars a week.
Contrast these wages ith the five and six dollars a day
paid in Bisbee and . three and four dollars paid else
where. This free land is the worker's gooo dream come
true. He came here from every nation of Europe to bet
ter his condition. Americ has two most kind to him
and kinder still to his children. How he can think or act
or talk the traitor is past comprehension. Could he con
ceive of a worse punishment than to be compelled io go
back to his beloved Germauy and work for fifty cents
a day? .
A Bisbee man just returned from a trip declares thai
everywhere he went, on trains, in hotels and on tu
streets, the talk was of war, war, war. lie saw many
troop trains, and gave it as his opinion taat the troop
movement is increasing rapidly The war is coming
closer to us every day. It presses in home In a hundred
ways and will not be denied. This country's effort is
gaining momentum and t-pecd. So far the German pro
paganda to delay and hamper and restrict our prepara
tions has failei' utterly. With every hour of activity our
ardour will increase and our determination grow more
grim and rnlute ind the chances of success of ."lis
propaganda diminish. Since the president's last message
any ta'k of peace is trehon. Every citizen should ap
point himself a committee of one to see to it that the
pati'ist is citbe: tu-ottUd or sent to prison.
TEAM WORK VS. THE MACHINE.
Capt. Edward Lyell Fox in the Forum.
I stood in the dreary barrack yard of the German in'
fantry Kaserne at Frankfort-am-Maln. It was during this
war. With me was a German cavalry officer. Major Von
Wernecke. Across the yard from us stood a sloppy line
of new recruits. I had just come back from the front in
France and had seen the machine like efficiency of the
kaiser's host. I knew that before many months had
passed that line of barrack yard gawks would be march
ing with all the rigidness of the German army. I marvel
ed how it was accomplished. I asked Major Von Wer
necke, who was in charge of the training.
In an airy manner. It never occurring to him that he
was disposing of the personality of men, he said, "We
take away their name and give them a number. As Hans
Schmidt a man ceases to exist. We strive," and the
major cynically smiled, "entirely to destroy all their in
dividuality. They become cogs in a machine," and his
manner took on that objectional Prussian boastfulness,
" a world invincible machine, as you have seen."
A year later in our conferences at that West Point
of the civilian army, the officers' training camp, I re
membered his remark. It came to me in shocking con
trast. Our Instructor was reading to us from the regula
tions of the United States army. He read aloud, "Offi
cers will keep in as close touch as possible with the men
under their command and will strive to build up such
relations of confidence and sympathy as will insure the
free approach of their men to. them for counsel and as
sistance."
We won't use the word machine, for a machine has
no soul. Rather, we will use "team work." It is familiar
to Americans; they are used to it in both football and
baseball. They see it when a "double steal" is pulled off j
in the ninth inning with the score close. They see it j
when the 'varsity eleven holds for downs on its 3-yard
liae. That spirit of the American schools tad universities
is the spirit of the national army. Team work? In Ger
many it is unknown. In their universities they have no
chance to develop it; they have no sports that require it.
Their army is machine perfect. Ours will have perfect
team work.
WELL ARE YOU?
J. Horace McFarlanJ in the New York Independent
asks these vital questions:
Are you a civic mendicant, receiving the unequaled
benefits of American citizenship without giving anything
but the taxes forced from you? Are you a civic whiner,
always complaining about the way "they" who govern
you do things, despite the fact that "they" is really you?
Are you a civic coward, afraid of losing worthless
friends, or of "interfering with business," if you call at
tention to inadequate service or poor methods in public
school administration, or in the street cleaning, or in
some other portion of .the public service? - - -
Are you a civic -sneak, trying to avoid Just taxation
by evasion or downright dishonesty, and thus putting
upon your neighbor part of the burden which is yours
Are you a civic waster, considering that the water supply,
the food and fuel you buy, the service of collecting garb
age and refuse, the city's parks, and in general the com
munity service for which you pay or do not pay. Is to be
used less carefully than if it was not related to the pres
ent needs of the fighting world?
Are you a civic "uplifter" to use Doctor Ellito's good
word who throws refuse into the streets, who fails to
keep home premises pleisant in the eyes of his neighbors?
Do you. In your business, spread the virus of civic small
pox through either using or permitting the placing of the
advertising signs which assault the eyes of your defense
less neighbors?
Determine the status of your citizenship. By search
ing self -inquiry find out whether you are a negative, and
therefore half bad citizen; whether you are a selfish and
destructive citizen, pulling down what others are en
deavoring to build np, or whether you are truly a con
structive citizen, jealous tor the quality and the honor
of the government of which yon are a part.
Secretary of War Baker and General Crozier, heal
of the ordnance department, are pretty sure to be a
storm center during th present session of congress.
Congressmen want to know what has been done and is
being done new to supply adequate artillery, machine
guns and shells for the armies, formed and in process of
formation. The utmost secrecy prevails about the prog
press of this work. No cne knows just what has been
done except Baker and Crozier. and they won't tell. For
fear, maybe the Germans will find it out. Baker says it
Is alright, but congress wants to KNOW! It Is certain
that there is no artillery for any of the western army
cantonments for the men to drill with. Not even machine
guns. Crozier says the visible supply has been sent to
France for our troops o.er there. Three billion dollar?
were given by congress for ordnance. Artillery has be n
our weakest point Tremendous energy and the utter
most in efficiency were required to repair this fatal de
ficiency. What has been done? Is everything being done
now that is possible? Both congress and the country
would like to know. If all is well, we should worry about
what the Germans find out about it. If all is not well,
we want to clean house.
Modem medical science has not yet found mefns di
rectly to prevent pneumonia or masles or meningitis.
There are minor epidemics of all three of these diseases
at the army training .-amps. But if an army camp had
an epidemic of smallpox, the medical men In charge
would consider themselves disgraced. That is because
vaccination is made compulsory as a matter of rotit in-.

At 8 o'clock Saturday night quite a
number 'jf their friends were on hand
at the depot to say goodbye to K. L.
Cadwell and family, who were about to
leave on the gas car for their new
home in A Jama, Ga., says the Ajo

there and played several patriotic airs,
including "Dixie."
Mr. Cadwell and his wife were very
popular here, and the family, whicn j
includes three children, will be great
ly missed at Ajo. Mr. Cadwell has been
superintendent of the T. C. & G. B. R.
R. since its Construction, nearly two
years ago. and not long ago he was
made assistant superintendent of ihe
New Cornelia Copper company. Be
fore coming to Ajo he was superin
tendent of the Warren Street Rail

is electricity, and he feels that tois :s
a si ep upward.
He also has great execu:ive ability,
as well as pleasing manners in deal
ing with the public. A young man, a
brilliant future is undoubtedly ahead.
His Interest in electricity began
when he was quite young, at WiIc'jx, :
where his father, Fred E. Cadwell, in
stalled and superintended an electric
light plant. His father was later post
master of Douglas for about fifteen
years, and is now in the undertaking
business there.

Armistice Operates
Vrom the Baltic sea to the mouth ot
the Danube the armistice between the
Russians and Rumanians and Austro
eGrmans is still in Operation. The
agreement for the cessation of hostil
ities between the Rumanians ana tlir
Teutonic allies covers the region from
the Dniester river to the mouth of the
Danube, according to the Berlin war
office. An unofficial dispatch front
Jassy, the Rumanian capital, says the
armistice is to continue for tnree
mVmths and that the Teutons have
agreed to all the proposals made by
the Rumanians, except that providing
that their troops shall hot be removed
to other fronts. This proposal is still
under discussion.
Teutons Move Forces
That the Aitro-Germans are reliev
ing men from duty "on the eastern
front and throwing them into the lines
in France and Italy daily grows nior
apparent by reason of the almost con
tinuous augmentation of their foices
in these regions. The belief prevails
that the enemy is preparing for a great
offensive on the western front.
The Italians have definitely stir p!d
the attempted drive of the Aitro
Gcrmans toward the Italian plains
and the Germans have failed thus far
to follow up their success of last week
against General Byng's army on the
Cambrai sector in France.

Stating that military expediency ;
and the ruthlessness of the present;
ruling regime of the German empire ;
was alone responsible for the terrible
war in Europe, Dr. James A. Francis
spoke to several hundred people at :
the Y. M. C. A. auditorium on Sunday:
afternoon. The speaker's subject was
"What Uncle Sam Stands for in This
War."
Francis said America should have
declared war on Germany inside of 24
hours after Germany invaded Belgium
but "we appealed to reason." Ger
man agents blew up our munition fac
tories and we appealed to reason.
Germany destroyed unarmed liners On
the high seas, killing innocent women
and children; a!ie killed American ,
citizens without shadow of excuse and
we appealed to reason. After all of
this we elected a president woh kept '.

Hie process of heating water for domestic purposes has been rev
olutionized m the past few years through the introduction and
perfection of gas fired water heaters, until today it is no longer a
a problem to secure an abundance of hot water quickly and econo
mically, in any dwelling, large or small.
Today, in the countless thousands of homes where gas fired water heaters are in
stalled, an abundance of hot water is available for any purpose. By some types of heat
ers the water is heated instantly at the turn of a faucet, by others, within a few min
utes after lighting the heaters, and all without labor, inconvenience or discomfort, ind
at a reasonable cost for gas.

GRAIN MARKET
CHICAGO, IVc. 10. Severe cold
that hampered teaming from farms
and atso handicapped the railways
tended to make th corn market aver
age higher. Prices closed unsettled,
January $1.20 to $1.20', and May
S1.19. with the range as a whole
varyine from c off to sc compared
with Saturday's finish. Oats gained
ll to lc and provisions SO to 50c.
Cent traders gave first attention to
the outlook that continued low tem
peratures means considerable slowing
up on the crop movement and further
more implied an increase of feeding
demand. On the resulting bulge in
prices, however, buxinpr was not of
aegregate character an3 it was point
ed out that the prevailing cold
weather was ilne for the continuing
of corn. Something of a setback fol
lowed owing in part to prospects
that embargo on shipments to the
east would lead in the near future in
a rapid accumulation of stocks htre.
The fact' that offerings were readily
absorbed in the l;ite dealings evoked
a fresh rally as the season came to
an end.
Oats opralleled the" action of corn.
The visible supnly total showed a de
cided falling off on account of large
reductions at seaboard points.
