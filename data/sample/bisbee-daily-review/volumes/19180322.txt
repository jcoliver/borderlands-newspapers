and that despite anti-submarine

some facts, which taken in con

tions of Sir Eric Geddes, and the
ofiieial fisures published here to
day by the British embassy, will
show the pre82nt ship 'construc
tion situation as clearly as the
Eritish have shown the rate' of
destruction. The British official
figni-js show more than 11,000,000
tons of -ships destroyed since
submarine warfare began and
only 6,000.000 tons of ships built
to take their places. They show
that the rate of submarine de
struction steadily has decreased
from tfc I' heights it reached when

a nw and unmsTicted campaign
of ruthlessness and forced the

FRENCH
WITH THE AMERICAN ARMY IN
FRANCE. Marcu 21 tty the Assd
Press! The raid into the Uerm&n po
sitiotn east of Lnneville last night by
American tnd French troops was car
ried under cover ot darkness and as a
haze Lepan to roll in over the hills fac
ing the American lines on that partic
ular portion, of the Rector.
From an observation station L-h up
in a tree tup, the correspondent -va'ch
ed the artillery preparation. It le,;ia
soon after dusk, orange colored hirsts
of flame where the American guns
were tiring showing In certain pines
in th wood round about. From the
hillsides across the vaiiey the German
gun retaliated.
For more than half an hour, the bril
liant bluisbwhite flash of their jrans
was like jumping electric sparks nerc
and there. Soon the reports of the ex
plosions became a deatening roar that
rolled in from everywhere as the nunr.
far and near ca.ne into action. Tlii3
was the time for the barrage. From
the fpoot where the shells fell a oon
stsnc red glow ' showed through the
darkness. At the same time th Ger
man guns increased their tire.
As the barrage lifted the ro;u- be
came quiet ymt at the nioiu'Ui ifc&
Americans and French went over th
trip. The noise of the German guii3
sounded like some one beating z Mg
bass drum.
Soon nearly all the firing ceased a.vl
almost immediately the rattle of nt
chine guns find automatic rifles ocean.
Occassicnally ritle fire broke in and
then all was fairly quiet for nearly half
an hour, except for occasional bursts
of rifle fire end short bursts of auto
matic ritles. 1
The- first members of the raiding
party to return to the American front
line were the stretcher bearers. When
all the raiders had returned, dull ex
plosions sounded from within the en
emy lines and occasionally there -were
bursts of flame showing where dug
outs were being blown up.
. Thi raiding party came back miui
staincvd and some were smeared with
blood. They reported they had secured
no prisoners beer use the Germans had
fled .is the Americans and French
dropped into their trenches.
Some of the. Germans were shot
whue they were trying to get away
and ethers were killed ty the Ameri
can iiheiis. One German whe had
placed himself between, the first and
second lines with an automatic rifle
was discovered by an American soldier
who ihaileuged him. The German
turned to draw a revolver. The Amer
ican promptly killed him and went on
further into the enemy lines.
The patrol got much information ol
value and except for the lack of pris
oner the laid was pronounced a suc
cess fromvery point of view by both
Frenoa ami American officers.
Mobt of thcii.fa. iitrymcn who partici
pated in the raid came from New York
although there were some from New
Jersey. Some oi the engineers who
accompanied the party as pioneers
were lroru California.

Common garden sage brewed into
a heavy tea, with sudphur and alcohol
added, will turn gray, streaked and
faded hair beautifully dark and luxur
iant. Mixing the Sage Tea and Sul
phur recipe at home, though, is trou
blesome. An easier way is to get the
ready-to-use prenaraticn. improved by
the addition of other ingredients, e.
large bottle, at little t-(t. at drug
stores, known as "Wyetb's Sage and
Sulphur Compound." thus avoiding a
lot of muss.
While gray, faded hair is not sinful,
we all desire to retain our youthful
appearance and attractiveness. . By
'arkening your hair with Wyeth's Sage
and Sulphur Compound, no one can
tell, because it does it so naturally,
so evenly. You just dampan a sponge
or soft brush with it and draw this
through your l.air, taking one small
strand at a time; by morning all gray
hairs have disappeared. After another
application or two your hair becomes
beautifully dark, glossy, soft and lux
uriaut end you appear years pounger.
Wyeth s Sage and Sulphur Compound
is a delightful toilet requisite. It is
not intended for the care, mitigation
or prevention of disease. . Adv.

His People A livays Know
Where Sen. Smith Stands
Arising in the U. S. senate the other day
to a question of personal privilege, Senator
Mark Smith of Arizona thus made his posi
tion clear upon the Harold Steinfeld effort
to evade the national army draft :
"Mr. President, I beg the indulgence of
the senate at this time for a moment to
make a statement in the nature of personal
explanation, if not of privilege. There is
a ycung man in my town, Mr. Harold Stein
feld, within the draft age and who has
stood a physical examination and has been
favorably passed on more than once by the
local board. Mr. Steinfeld's father is the
owner and manager of a large mercantile
business and is reputed to be a man of great
wealth. The local board passing on young
Steinfeld's claim for exemption as manager
of this mercantile business refused to grant
the exemption. Appeals were taken then,
and at this end of the line great influences
from prominent men outside of Arizona
have been attempting to save him from
serving his country in this time of its dire
necessity.
"I have received many letters of protest
against Mr. Steinfeld's evasion of the draft
and charges that I have been instrumental
in keeping him out of the army. Such
accusations are utterly false. On the con
trary, I have told General Crowder and the
assistant secretary of war that I could see
no reason why Mr. Steinfeld should avoid
the draft any more than dozens of other
young men from Arizona, who are now in"
the army under the draft and are giving that
loyal service which our country expects
from its able-bodied young men. I merely
make this statement thus publicly so as to
silence the misrepresentations being made
against me at home by persons whose
motives for the circulation of such false
hoods, are, of course, unknown to me. I
hope it may never justly be said that any
man can avoid the performance of his duty
to his country by reason of his wealth or all
influence that can be brought to bear in
favor of his evasion of duty."
' At last the United States and England,
acting together, have moved to press the
Dutch shipping into service. And by this
act we have helped Holland when she. could
not help herself. Do not be deceived by the
fact that Holland refused to agree to the
seizure of her ocean tonnage. She did not
dare to agree, no matter how badly she
might have desired to do so in order to se
cure foodstuffs. Germany held the sword
over her and clouded her sky with threats.
A million tons of Dutch shipping had been
tied up for months. Germany had threat
ened to sink every boat that left harbor.
If transferred to the allies Germany threat
ened to make war upon Holland. That
has been the situation since early in the
year. And the neutral nations actually suf
fering for food. Fortunately over half this
tonnage lay in English and American port3
when the Prussian bully declared it out of
action, so it was kept there. Now Uncle
Sam and John Bull have taken possession
of it under international law, agreeing to
reimburse the little kingdom in full after
the war, and propose to use it to carry food
to and fro across the Atlantic, for neutral
ps well as allied peoples, in the face pf the
kaiser and his personal ally, the devil. This
is the Dutch ship question in a nutshell.
We beat Germany to these ships. She"
would have sealed them in port for the
pcricd of the war if she could, and let the
neutrals starve. Holland's alternative, then
was war or famine. This is the German
way. Simple as a tiger in a jungle path,
cruel aj a soft nosed bullet.

FACING THE FACTS.
It is a stern, hard, but none the less true
view that Arthur Brisbane, especial friend
of the workingmen, and formerly himself
inclined to socialism, takes of the Russian
situation in a most forceful editorial on the
first page of his Washington Times as fol
lows :
The Russians listen in mournful silence
to the reading of President Wilson's en
couraging message, and after mournful
listening the Coviets vote to accept Ger
many's peace and obey Germany's orders.
Poor Russia is about as capable of gov
erning herself apparently as- a steam roller
turned loose on the highway "with power
on" and no driver.
Trotzky, the little soap box gentleman,
made a big mistake when he took himself
for a steam roller conductor, and knows it.
Typically Russian is the reply of that big
country kneeling in the mud in front of Ger
many -and calmly cabling to President Wil
son "its warm sympathy and confidence
that the time is not far distant when the
masses will overthrow capitalism and es
tablish a socialist society which alone is
capable of giving a lasting and just peace
and assuring the welfare of the toilers."
Considering the sample of efficiency that
socialism and "the toilers'' have just given
to the world in Russia, there is something
very pleasing about this message.
President Wilson, of course, will answer
nothing or answer kindly and gently.
. He might, however, assure those "toil
ers" that voted for liberty and then ran
away fiom the enemies of the country, that
at least two things are necessary in govern
ment. One is intelligence and the other is
courage.
Russia must acquire at least one of the
two. Until she does, she will be governed
by Prussia unless the allies change condi;
tions for her.
A correspondent writes a talc from
France more thrilling than any battle. It
has to do with a meal eaten in the trenches
with American soldiers. A meal cooked
by a southern darky who hashed his pota
toes to rag time and concocted chicken
gravy in the real old southern style. The
narrative of how this child of New Orleans,
transplanted to a foreign soil, was able to
steal a chicken for his young masters' mess
cught to make better reading than the tak
ing of that cavern in the Chemin des
Dames. His strategy, his cunning, his
speed, his judgment, all vere doubtless
brought into play with all the tense earnest
ness that Joffre used at the Marne. If that
darkey ever comes back to live again by the
Mississippi, where it joins the sea, his story
of the theft of that chicken from a citizen
of Toul ought to outrank the greatest of
Joel Chandler Harris stories of the South
in its absorbing interest and its strange plot.
Douglas International: The resignation
of J. P. Henderson of Tombstone, as dis
bursing officer of the Arizona draft board,
should be very satisfactory to the good citi
zens of Tombstone, who went after his
scalp when he was appointed to the posi
tion through the influence of Governor
Hunt. The citizens of Tombstone believed,
and we believe they had a right to believe,
that Henderson was notoriously pro-German
in spirit, or at least that he was not in
sympathy with the endeavors of hi3 coun
try and her allies to win the war. Good bye,
Mr. Henderson.
C. M. Wilchar, four-minute man, declar
ed to an El Paso audience the other day,
that "the cost of running thd war in
Europe is falling heavier on the rich rr.rtn
than cn any other." And then just to drive
home his point and clinch it in the mind of
any doubter or skeptic, the speaker im
pressed upon his hearers the necessity for
making their income tax returns before
ApnlL
Plunder, not peace, is what Germany de
sires. Her words are words of peace, but
her acts are those of a rapacious robber
brought to bay and standing, p3tol in hand,
over his plunder, asking only to be allow
ed to go his own way with what he has
taken. The course that officers take with
such a malefactor will be the course that
the allies will take with this national robber
61 toddy.

privates of a cavalry repiroent sta
tioned at Douclas, Ariz., were found
guilty of second l??ree ninrder at
Silver City. X. M., for the killing of
P. E. Burke, a Douplas service car
driver. The killing occurred January
4. at Rodeo, X. M., wher? Burke had
driven tL'e ruen from Uouslas. Ev
idence introduced at the trial tended
to show the crime was the outcome
of a dispute over Burke'B r?fusal to
purchase liquor for the soldiers. The
two men were taken from a freight
train upon their arrival in El Paso on
the morning' after the tragedy.

months has been operating in the
Altar district, according to informa
tion reaching here yesterday. The
outlaws were under tie leaderahlj"of
Erasto and Daniel Valdez. the latter
being- wounded and captured In the

band was scattered.
Tuesday night a son was born to
Mrs. J. W. Hhineberger, daughter of
Mr. and Mrs. B. W. Holland in Tomb

an of-'icial card from Mr. Rhlneberger,
who stated briefly that b.9 had arriv
ed overseas safely with Uncle Sam's
torces, having sailed some time ago
from an Eastern port.
Mr. and Mrs. H. O. Hammond ol
Douglas, will leave on Friday next
for Verde, where they will make their
tuture home. Verde is the name of
the new town which is coming on the
map along with the new smelter be
ing constructed by the United Verde
Kxtensicn company, now nearing com
pletion. Mr. Hammond has resigned
the position of chief chemist at the
Copper Queen smelter here to accept
a similar position with thu United
Verde Extension. He has been a resi
lent of Douglas for more than eight
rears and' has worked for the Queen
all the time.
Police officers yesterday arrested
'n Douglas the 15-year-old son of Joe
Massey on a charge of stealing $300
frcm his father. The Massey lad and
Joaquin Coi'ello were accused of break
ing cpen the.eldr Massey's trunk

attempting to leave the city. The Co
rello boy took $50 of the money, it
as said, and up to late last night had
not been found. The police found

police and Southern Pacific official I
yesterday he had lost $S65. .The mon-1

At Monday's meeting of the board
of supervisors of Yavapai county, the
"bootlegger bill," presented by H. D.
Dowell, representing the Thlel Detec
tive Agency of Los Angeles, for a sum
over $4000, was Katly disallowed. The
official action taken was based on
grounds that the account was not au
thorized, although the claim bore the
endoisement of County- Attorney E. J.
Mitcuell and Sheriff J. F. Young.
Tei thousand dollars, representing
the payroll fund of the American

Express company at that point, it was
ascertained today, following the disap
pearance of J. G. Eades, express agent
at that point. He disappeared Mon
day afternoon. Investigation followed
an inquiry by a smelter official as to
the arrival of the money. There is no
clue to Eades' whereabouts.
Le.non extract jags have become so
frequent in Phoenix during the past
thre-j weeks that efforts are now be
ing made to prevent the sale of a cer
tain well known brand of this partic
ular flavoring. This is the newest
phase of intoxication that the Phoenix
police department has had to contend
with, according to the statement made
public by Police Chief George O. Bris
bols. The popularity of the drink has
assumed proportions that equal, if not
surpass, the whisky drinking habit, it
was announced.
The Camp Harry Jones army quar
termaster's office yesterday afternoon
received word that the lumber con
trac's for the two cantonment3 to be
built here had been awarded and that
construction work would po forward
just as soon as th? material can be
delivered. This announcement was
made by Gen. De R. C. Cabell, Arizona
district commander, at a meeting o:
the directors of tha Douglas chamber
of commerce and mines held last night
to discuss the sewerage problem at
the army camp. General Cabell did
net say to whom the contrac'a had
been awarded, but his statement gave
positive assurance that there would
be nc further delay in the erection oi
he two regimental quarters in Douglas.

Members of the Y. M. C. A. educa
tional committee mot yesterday after
noon at the association for the reg
ular weekly -discussion of tire mining
course, means of improving present
classes and to take up plans for in
creasing the number of subjects
I taught.!
A great deal of interest is being
taken in tha mining course and the
classes attending the lectures every
Thursday afternoon and evening are
steadily g-rowir.g. Miners and muck
ers are coming, more and more to
realize that by attending this course
Jtheir chances of improving .their
work and thereby securing promotion
are enhanced.
Too the results of this course, are
being noticed more as time passes in
,. ton , .rt
men who attend. These are wonderful
possibilities to such- p. course both
from the companies viewpoint and
that of the employes as it helps to
bring the nten in closer personal con
tact with the men higher up in the
employ of the mines and tends to
;P've tnem a

i early morning when the white sheets
of paper crackle with electricity as
! they take the print of type and pre
pare to cany to the .world the story of
the past twenty-four hours.
' Murray came to the Review in De
cember, 1!U2. Ho has been with the
Review since. He has also been with
Bisbee since. He made this his home.
He married In this city. He earned
his money in Bisbee, and spent it in
nisbee. And. though he sometimes
speaks of Indiana es his home, he has
really become nn Arizonan. a resident
of Cochise couhty and of Bisbee. He
will leave the service of the Review
with the Arizona men, wiil enter the
service of the I'nited States with the
Cochise county contingent, and when
the war is over and he is mustered
out. he will return again to Bisbee.
Murray has made many friends in
this city and district. I-ist night he
spent the early hours, in bidding them
farewell. Early this morning he
wiped down his press, over which he !
has guarded for the past five and one-
half years, for the last lime,
pulled
back the lever which starts the flow of
whit3 paper over the inky type, and
for the last time until he shall have
concluded his work as a soldier,
watched the morning's news pile up
in nedtly folded sheets. Therun over,
he dropped the curtain over his press,
turned ouc the lights and clambered
aboard the Golden State Limited. He i

TAKE 'GASGABETS' IF .
' HEADACHY, EiLIGUS
AND CONSTIPATED
Best for liver and bowels, bad
breath, bad colds, sour
stomach.
Get A 10-cent box.
Sick headache, biliousness, coated
tongue, head and nose clogged up with
a cold always trace this to torpid
liver; delayed, fermenting food in the!
bowels, or sour, gassy stomach.
Poisonous matter clogged in the in
testines, instead of being cast out of
the system is re-absorbed into the
blood. When this p'jison reaches the
delicate brain tissue it causes conges
tion and that dull, throbbing, sickening
headache. .
Cascarets Immediately cleanse the
stomach, remove the sour, undigested
lutni biiu iuui KHAea, iukb ihc c.vras.Tuc uadockj cm dumb rt
bile from the liver and carry out alii
the constipated waste matter and pois-
ons in the bowels. j
A Cascaret tonight will surely '
straighten you out by m'ornlng. They
work while you sleep a 10 cent box
c'ear- stomach sweet and your liver ;
