Konenkamp Announces That
He Will Call Out All Of
Union Men ; Few Affected
Not Enough W. U. Men In
Union To Make Much Of a
Difference, General Belief
SAN FRANCISCO, June 6. June 11
has been decided upon aa the date for
the beginning of the nation-wide
strike of telegraphers, according to
a telegram said to have been received
by Patrick O'Connor, president of a
local union, from L. L Marshall, first
vice president of the state organiza
tion of the Commercial Telegraphers'
Union of America.
WASHINGTON, June 6. President
S. J. Konenkamp, of the Commercial
Telegraphers' Union of America, an
nounced tonight that he would call a
nation-wide strike of members of the
-union upon reaching Chicago tomor
row. He said that neither the date of
the proposed walkout nor whether it
would affect ' both the Postal Telegraph-Cable
company and the West
ern Union Telegraph and Cable com
pany had been decided.
The strike, president Konenkamp
said, ' would be called in support of
union employes of the Western Union
in ten southeastern stateB, who were
requested by him to leave thIr work
last night following return by order
of Postmaster General Burelson of
the wire systems of the country to
private operation.
. Not Serious, Say U. S. Officials
' Postoffice. department officials,
while intimating that, whereas the
wire systems were now being operated
by the companies, the department was
not directly concerned in the contro
versy, expresses the belief that the
strike if called would not seriously af
fect communication. Western Union
officials here pointed to the statement
in New York today of Newcomb Carl
ton, president of the company, that
out of 40,000 employes eligible to join
the Commercial Telegraphers' union,
only 710 were members.
Leaders . in congress, despite the
postmaster general's order, returning
the -wires to private operation, went
forward with their plans for legisla
tion for repeal of the wire control reso
lution. Charge Burleson "Passed Buck"
Reopening the hearings on the bill
by Senator Kellogg, Republican of
Minnesota, for repeal of the wire reso
lution, the senate interstate commerce
committee, questioned J. C. Kingsbury,
vice president of the American Tele
phone and Telegraph company, as to
legislation necessary to protect the
wire companies During the hearing
some members of the committee
charged the postmaster general, con
fronted by a strike. Issued the return
order for the purpose of "passing the
buck."
Mr. Burleson, in a letter to Chair
man Cummins of the senate commit
tee, declared his order had been mis
interpreted and that actual control of
the wire systems bad not passed from
the department, but only 'operation
had been relinquished. '
The committee agreed to amend the
Kellogg bill o as to continue existing
telephone toll rates in effect for 90
days after the wires are returned in
stead of 60 as originally proposed.

Maimed U. S. Heroes Hold Athletic
Carnival; Men Who Left Legs In
Argonne Forest Speedy On Bases
DES MOINES, la., June 6.
Wounded heroes of European bat-
tlefields, some of them with only
one leg or an arm and a few
without any legs, today played
baseball, ran races and took part
in other novel events of a track
and field meet at Fort Des Molnea
which is said to be the first ath
letic carnival ever held exclus
ively for wounded soldiers.
When a downpour of rain broke
up the baseball game between
the one-legged men and . one
armed men, the two thousand
spectators were . well satisfied
that while the wounded soldiers
may be handicapped, they decid
edly are not down-hearted. In
fact, one lad, who left a leg in
the Argonne forest, seemed to re
gret that a little more of his leg
had not' been amputated.
"If that stump had . been a lit
tle shorter, I'd won that last
race," he said; after finishing
second in one event. "It got in

Her testimony and that of Steve

ruling of Judge J. C. Tucker that the
defendant might introduce testimony
to show actual conditions along the
Mexican border, leaving it incumbent
upon the defendant to show that the
wrter of the alleged libelous editorial
headed "Ford is an anarchist," had
such knowledge in a general way at
the time he wrote the editorial.

WASHINGTON,' June 6. Resolu

the text of the treaty with Germany
and directing the foreign relations
committee to investigate how copies
of the unpublished document have

were adopted by the senate without
a roll call.
Action on the two proposals came
unexpectedly during a lull in the
stormy debate they had aroused, and
scarcely a score of senators were in
the chamber when, in quick succes
sion, the resolutions were put to a
vote. Their passage itself, however,
was no surprise, as it generally bad
been conceded that each would have
a majority.
The request for the treaty will be
referred by state department officials
to President Wilson and Secretary
Lansing In Paris and pending a re
ply no official opinion is available
here as to whether the text will be
forthcoming. . y

Under the investigation resolution
introduced at the request 'of the

will meet Monday to formulate plans
which may include the summoning
of members of the American peace

Strike Leaders Admit They
Seek To Quit; Soldiers
Deciding Factor
.
WINNIPEG, Man., June 6 With un
ion leaders late tonight admittedly
making every effort to reach a settle
ment, the end of the Winnipeg strike
seemed rapidly approaching.
Opposition of the returned soldiers
seemed to have decided the struggle.
Delegations of union men announced
if the strike leaders rejected any
"fair offer to settlement" by Monday,
they intended to "go back to their
Jobs." -
R. B. Russell, one of the "Big Five"
strike leaders, said: "Certain mem
bers' of the citizens' committee were
blocking a" settlement." '
One of the union leaders said to
night . forms have been prepared to
ascertain whether employers are will
ing to take back all men and women
who participated In the general strike.
It was pointed out at the city hall the
federal government had flatly refused
to reinstate postal employes who left
the service and that the city has taken
the same attitude regarding the fire
men on strike.
CITY NOW QUIET
WINNIPEG, June 6. Comparative
calm again spread through Winnipeg
this afternoon after three of the most
vivid days in the city's history.
The proclamation of Mayor Charles
F. Gray, forbidding public parades,
received the endorsement of nearly
every faction involved in the general
strike.
. Winnipeg's police force was supple
mented todayv by more: than ,1300 re
turned , soldier constables and a cav
alry unit of more than 100 war veter
ans.
Mass meetings were held by strik
ers and their sympathizers at Victoria
park and by returned soldiers at the
auditorium.
Brigadier General H. D. B. Ketch-en,
addressing the returned solders' mass
meeting, declared that the Winnipeg
strike can no longer be considered a
union labor protest, but that it is an
attempt to overthrow the government.
"Rest assured the dominion govern
ment and the military are not idle,"
he said, and intimated the government
is taking step3 to deal with Bolsne-
vism and revolution. .
"When the government does act, iu
connection with the Winnipeg up
heaval, I am sure you soldiers all will
agree that when I intimated today that
action was impending to deal with rev
olution and Bolshevism, I did not tell
you all."
Mayor Charles F. Gray spoke again
today. He asked for more constables
and he got them. Gray said the city
will have 3000 returned soldiers oh its
emergency police force before present
mobilizaton plans are completed.

Give Battle Against It
In Committee
WASHINGTON, June 6. Argv
ments for repeal of wartime prohibi

enforcement of that and constitution
al prohibition were heard today by the
house judiciary committee.
Wayne B. Wheeler, counsel for the
Anti-Saloon league, discussed legal
phases of the bill for enforcement of
prohibition now before the committee'
It was the intent of the amend
ment, he declared, to wipe out the li
quor traffic, "which has no inherent
right to exist," and the only difficulty
would come when a state attenpted
to permit something which the consti
tution prohibited.
"When that comes," he added, "we
will meet in the courts."
Mr. Wheeler was asked to give the
position of the Anti-Saloon league on
the question of refunding to dealers
taxes paid on liquors they had no
opportunity to sell.
"This is a matter that does not
concern us; it is more a question of
policy for the government," he re
plied. "Every liquor dealer who goe
Into business does so with the knowl
edge that his co-called property
rights can be taken away from him
and that he has no redress. But I
want to say that we have no desire to
destroy the property he Is unable to

NINES DEFENDANT IN
$30,000 ARIZONA SUIT
PHOENIX. June 6 Bringing a
$30,000 action for damages for the
benefit of the children of the deced
ent, James A. Glover, administrtor of
the estate of Martin B. Xaroney, to
day filed suit in the superior court
against Walker D. Hines, director
general of railroads, and the Arizona
Eastern railroad company. The suit
is based on a fatality which occurred
in March, 1919, when Maroney died,
it is alleged, as the result of injuries
received in coupling engines on the
Arizona Eastern tracks.
The plaintiff contends that the ac
cident was caused by the negligence"
of the railroad company. He alleges
that the rails on the turning table onj
which the switch engine was resting!
were higher by three inches than tnc
traek cn which the other engine was
standing, and which at the time con
nected with the track on the turning
table.
At the time of his death Maroney
is said . to have been earning $160
monthly. His children, his heirs at
law, are asking for an amount total
ing $30,000.

Woman Tells Tragic Story
Mrs. Austin told her tragic story
in -a low,, but clear voice in which
there was a quavering note denoting
the effort she was making at self con
trol. She said she was born in Ver
mont 58 years ago and went with her
husband and one son. Charles, to Se
bastian, nine years ago.
Mr. Smith's testimony served as u
preface to that of Mrs".' Austin. He
was at Sebastian, a mile and a quar
ter frcm the Austin ranch, working
as a corn cutter with Mr. Au.stin a id
the latter's son, when a band of Mex
ican raiders appared. They robbed
the general store and a detachment
of them rode away, taking the two
Austins with them in a cart.
Mrs. Austin told of her terror when
the detachment numbering five men
eutered her house and of the ol-jr:3
of her husband and son to reasjuro
her. The bandits took a shotgun ar.d
a rifle and some ammunition and then
rode away with Mr. Austin and nis
son still in the cart.
Finds Bodies of Husband and Son
"I must have become unconscious,
and when I came to the dog was lick
ing my face" said the witness. "When
I could muster the strencth I followed
and found the bodies of my son and
husband. They wfrc doad mvrciur
cd." Spilth's testimony showed that he
telephoned to nearby villages, giving
notiYe of the raid on Sebastian. The
ti'-arcst troops, bo said, wfn 12 mil-s
away. Two of tho band whi.-h kilied
the Austins, were afterward captured
and hanged.
Mr. Conrad identified himself ls a

produced a detail map of.wtlie llrour.s

up automatically under- the senate
rules and it was disposed of within
less than a minute with only a few
scattered "noes." It had been oppos
ed stubbornly during the two weeks
of debate by the president's support
ers, and the general expectation had
been that the vote on it would he
close.
In suggesting the Kellog substitute,
Senator Lodge said the Hitchcock
resolution apparently had been "has
tily drawn" and that his object was
to improve the language of the meas
ure. With this Senator Hitchcock
immediately took issue, saying the
substitute wes quite different in con
tent because it did not name Sena
tors Lodge and Borah; Republican of
Idaho, as having made the charges
that the treaty is in private hands in
New York.
His own proposal, continued Mr.
Hitchcock, would show, by naming
the two senators, where the informa
tion came from that started the in
quiry. "1 am amazed," continued the Ne
braska senator, "at the position tak
en by the senator from Massachu
setts. Yesterday he wanted immedi
ate actibn. Yesterday and . the day
before he was for this resolution
And now the senator, who was so
anxious to make statements here
about the treaty being in New York,
wants some one else investigated."
Lodge Thinks Veracity Questioned
Referring to inferences that the
treaty was in the hands of financial
interests. Senator Hitchcock drew a
pointed reply irom Senator . Lodge.
"I didn't say that," shouted the for
eign relations chairman. "Does the
senator question the truth of what I
say?"
"No," retorted Senator Hitchcock,
"but I think we ought to have another
investigation to find out what's hap
pened during the last 24 hours and
what new light the senators on the
other side of the chamber have seen.
"You can beat my resolution if you
want to. You can put in that vague
substitute. But the people of the
country won't be satisfied with that
kind of an investigation."
Senator Lodge denied that he de
sired to evade investigation and as
sured Senator- Hitchcock that he
would "get all the investigation he
desires."
Senator Borah said he thought the
other resolution would be broad
enough to give the "committee access
to "the whole field" of investigation.
Lodge Has "Secret Covenant"
There was much speculation tonight
as to the turn the inquiry may take.
Senator Lodge told the senate yes
terday that he could not reveal the
source of his information about the
treaty copies, and Senator Borah Is
understood to take the same view.
In " some quarters it was suggested
that subpoenas might be issued - to
representatives of any financial In
terests suspected of having -private
channels for securing such informa
tion. Another opinion was that the
inquiry would begin at the other end
and would seek to locate, first any
possible "leak" among government
officials or attaches.
In this connection much comment
was caused by an Associated Press
diPDatch mentioned in the senate dur
ing the day by Senator McCormick,
Republican of Illinois, saying it was
understood in Paris that the Berlin
government was sending copies of the
treaty to members of congress. So
far as could be learned, no such cop
ies have arrived here. Senator Eo
rah has announced his intention of
making the treaty public as soon as
he receives a copy, but he said to
night he had been unable so far to
obtain one. -

PEACE MEET SUMMARY
(By the Associated Press.

. There are many.evidences of iin
patience among the prominent mem
bers of the peace conference. T Pre

vision of opinion, and differene among
the British experts working on repara:

is attending the meetings of the re
parations commission.
The Italians are showing great un
easiness over the unsettled Adriatic
proble mas Premier Orlando insists
that it must be settled before the Ital
ian parliament meets June 18. The
council of four considered the Adriatic
problem today . but ; no decision was
reached.
A general drive all along the line
for a 6peedy completion of the reply
to Germany has been noticeable for
.the last two days. The experts have
j been meeting constantly and there is
a general disposition to wind up dif
ferences which ; a - member of the
.American delegation said would be

mitted there were.- three or four vital
points upon which the council of four

proposals to the treaty by Thursday

, the latest dispatches from Paris,
j It is understood the allied and as
' sociated governments had decided to
adopt a middle course, as oetween the
fixing of a definite sum to be exacted
from Germany, a proceeding strenu
ously objected to by the French a3
.likely to lead. to a political upheaval
'due to the disappointment of the
French public, and rthe provisions of
the draft of the treaty handed the
Germans, which the latter have de
clared means economic slavery. .The
reparations to be demanded for cer

all of them, as -the, only sum for the
total losses which he French have,
declared themselves willing to' agree'
to mounts to a figifre the experts de
l clare Germany- will be unable to pay.
It is probable the Germans will be
allowed some working capital and ton
nage for overseas trade with which to
earn the sums required of them.
The clauses of the treaty concern
ing responsibilities' punishment of the
former kaiser and the disposition of
Germany's overseas colonies, likely
will stand as set forth in the original

On .Silver Cycle Snares at $1.50
SILVER CYCLE is a sensational stock BECAUSE it is in the
SENSATIONAL neighborhood-, IN BLOCK 75.
The least bit of extra news of new development will be the means
of taking up every share that is offered at $1.50.
WE BELIEVE THAT NEWS IS NOW ON THE STREET
It came over the wire, is absolutely authentic and reads as
follows:
"Wichita Falls, June 2. Meadows Barker well in
Block 75, adjoining Silver Cycle, on the east, came
in today with a good flow of oil. The well has not yet
been fully completed and the drillers say It will be a
sensational well. P. J. McKeown."
This telegram in reference' to the MEADOWS BARKER will
mean the heavy, buying of SILVER CYCLE and should over
subscribe the reservations which Brokers are offering at $1.50.
Just how much of the stock can be bought EVEN . NOW at $1.50,
is hard to estimatcand many are holding it for higher prices.
SILVER CYCLE SHOULD BE SELLING at a price SOMEWHERE
NEAR her rich neighbors.
UNITED OIL is doing today what SILVER CYCLE ought to be
doing a short time from now. UNITED' OIL is sending out
dividend checks of 75 per cent. SILVER CYCLE Is 200 YARDS
FROM UNITED OIL.
GOLDEN CYCLE adjoining SILVER CYCLE is not only drilling
another well but is repairing the damage done by fire on her
first well. THEY tell us that the GOLDEN CYCLE'S first well
is really BIGGER THAN THE BURK-WAGGONER.
SUMMIT PET. OIL adjoining SILVER CYCLE brought in a
BIG WELL last week which started the ball rolling for SILVER
CYCLE.
MEADOWS BARKER the news just received on MEADOWS
BARKER should sell every share in sight of SILVER CYCLE
and we. dcubt if 25,000 SHARES can be bought from all the
brokers combined.
SILVER CYYCLE OIL COMPANY, headed by J. A. D. Smith, who
put OCEAN OIL on the map, is a REAL OIL COMPANY. This
company already has production in the "shallow" fields. This
company owns over 500 acres. Its capitalization of $150,000 war
rants the Company in guaranteeing the tl-rilling of Three Wells cn
their acreage in, Block 75. SILVER CYCLE OIL COMPANY IS
TODAY DRILLING THE FIRST ONE IN BLOCK 75.. SMITH
believes that this first. well will be "in" by the 17th of this month.
IT SHOULD BE A BIG WELL.
THE COMPANY HAS ANNOUNCED THAT ON JUNE 17TH THEY
WILL LIST THEIR SHARES ON THE EL PASO STOCK EX
CHANGE AT $3.00 A SHARE
(On the same date they will apply for listing on the New York
Curb and the Los Angeles Stock Exchange).
WE BELIEVE that tht market on SILVER CYCLE will be abave
$3.00 before the 17th. . THE LAW OF SUPPLY AND DEMAND
should place this stock at HIGHER FIGURES.
WE BELIEVE when the Company brings in their well in Block 75
that the SHARES WILL SELL AT 10 FOR 1.
THIS IS OUR VIEWPOINT. Looking at it frorr a Broker's
standpoint we have been favored in our judgment of STOCKS and
we have no hesitancy In recommending the immediate purchase
BY WIRE OF SILVER CYCLE AT $1.50 FOR A 10 TO 1

allow the defense to obtain affidavits
that these witnesses were necessary,
court adjourned until later in the day,

EVERETT TRUE
BISBEE WAR HEROES
OF 89TH TO REACH
HERE THIS MORNING
The vanguard of a score or more
of Tisbee fighters .with the famous
and battlescarred S9th Division of the
American Expeditionary Forces over
seas, three Bisbee war veterans will
arrive in this city on this morning's
train from El Paso, where they have
Just been demobilized at Fort Bliss.
In a telegram to his father here,
Walter Freeman, one of the boys,
last night wired that he is on his way
home from El Paso, accompanied by
two Bisbee comrades in arms, Dan
Angus and Ferdinand Fitzweir.
Whether other of the Bisbee boys are
due to arrive this morning, Freeman
does not state in his telegram.
All three of the returning boys saw
service with the 89th, which Governor
Campbell went to New York to greet,
and accompanied back to the demobi
lization point at Fort Bliss, in the
Argonee Forest drive, the first drive
of last mid-summer on the Vesle, and
other points where the famous divis
ion saw some of the war's hottest
action.
Freeman is a well known boxer,
who,' after defeating some of the best
athletes in . thi3 district, carried his
laurels overseas with him, winning a
number of bouts at boxing carnivals
staged by the A. E. F. in Paris. A
movement already has been started
by his friends to secure the staging
of a bout between Freeman and Rus
sell Chambers, another returned soldier-boxer
of this district, as a fea
ture of the athletic program in con
nection with Bisbee's Fourth of July
celebration.

BY A, E. GELDHOF.
N. E. A. Washington Bureau,
. 1128-1134 Munsey Building,
WASHINGTON, June Uncle
Sam is building a giant fence along
the Mexican border!
It's 1200 miles long, and while its
posts are of wood and other building
materials, Its rails will be American
soldiers. '.
Assistant Secretary ol War Crowell,
until recently acting secretary ot war,
ha3 given me special authorization to
tell for the first time the facts about
this big fence, placing all the informa
tion at the army's command at my
disposal.
The huge harrier Isn't a fence In the
real sense of the word, though its pur
poses is the same.
It's a, double row of cavalry patrol
stations, barracks buildings and mls
cellaneaus structures, stretching from
Brownsville, Texas, on the Gulf of
Mexico, to Arivaga, Ariz., on the edge
of the great desert
At each of the 50 outpost stations
one troop-of cavalry about 100 men
will be on guard all the time, patroll
ing the border between stations.
Some distance back from these pa
trol stations will be another series ofl
12 posts which will constitute a sort
of "second line of defense." These-12
posts will be larger, and each of them
will serve as a base for four or five
of the patrol stations on the boundary.
The complete system will house 10,000
soldiers. ,
The whole project will cost the war
department approximately $6,750,000,
according to an estimate made by
Lieut Col. O. P. Chamberlain of the
construction division of the army.
The 12 main posts probably will be
given the name "forts," 'but the war
department emphasizes the fact that
they will not be forts in reality, but
merely army posts, such as Ft. Bliss,
Ft. Ringgold and the other "forts" al
ready onthe border.
In explaining this project, Assistant
Secretary of War Crowell declared it
is primarily for defense . against the
elements, and not againat- the Mex
icans. It is admitted, however that
the patrol stations are for the pur
pose of guarding the border against
invasions by bandits . aud cattle
thieves. - -
There are at present about 10.000
soldiers on the border all cavalry
with the exception of the 25th Infan
.try, at Camp Stephen G. Little. These
men have been out of luck' during the
war with Germany. Not only were
they denied the privilege of going to
the front and getting a crack at the
Germans, but they have been living m
tents for about seven years with few
comforts and many hardships'.
Maior General Cabell, commander
of the southern department of the
army, has spent almost his entire mili
tary career on the border. . He is typi
cal of most of the other officers.
Since the armistice was signed these
soldiers have , been making their com
nlaints heard, with the result that the
war department decided to do some
thin for them.
The forces on the border are not to
be enlarged now but when these bar
racks are completed it will be ai easy
natter to accommodate twice or three
times the number of men now there, If

that is the way all tasks should be
handled. It's skill that counts in this
world with skill and sincerity, moral
fibre and cheerfulness, you can't lose.
Francis X. Bushman as Paul Don
aldson in this brilliant Metro photo
play, to be seen at the Eagle theatre
today only, certainly handles the job
he undertakes to do "with neatness
and dispatch.". The story has surpris
es every minute both for the hero
ana tne auaience. .tsut of course,'
there's nothing a man with red blood
in his veins wouldn't do if pretty Ger
aldine Ames ordered him to. (Bev
erly Bayne plays Geraldine.)
Much of the scene of "With Neat
ness and Dispatch" is laid on a great
estate where no man is permitted to
enter. The maiden aunt of Geral-I
dine and Mary calls it "Eden." But j
neither of the girls is disconsolate;
when the right kind of man succeeds 1
in "breaking into Eden," even if he ;
has to use a jimmy to do it. Romance :

When the Brain Saw Light
You read that a western ranchman buys an airplane for locating
strayed cattle. Another farmer installs a wireless outfit to keep in
touch with the Chicago grain market. Italian government is operating
1700 motor plows they do the work that required 20,000 yoke of oxen a
year ago. '
Wonderful is the progress of agriculture, dramatic, in the march
of time, the invasion of soil tilling by chemists, bacteriologists,
scientists.
Not long since plowing was done with a crooked stick. Even as re
cently as 100 yeaijs ago all plows were made of wood. Grain was cut
with a sickle, gathered in the arms; thrashed by flail and winnowed
in the wind.
Even Abraham Lincoln probably would have had heart failure at
sight of a tractor hauling five plows.
The sewmg machine, was invented some 60 years ago. Previous to
then sewing, one of the fundamental manual arts, had been done by
hand since cave men pieced skins into garments with catgut thread
through a bone needle.
Thirty years later came the typewriter. Another manual art, writing,
took its first step forward since the dim dawn of civilization.
Tool makin even antedates writing and sewing, going back to the
flint-chippers of the stone age. But for thousands of years men handled
tools the same way, with no thought of a possible better one. Then
came Taylor, the efficiency man, who showed hpw to drive' a nail with
fewer strokes. It had never occurred before to anyone that a nail would
drive more easily if it were sharpened.
Taylor also taught blicklayers how to carry more bricks on a hod.
Up to that time they had carried the same number as the Egyptian
masons who toiled thousands of years before Cleopatra.
Consider modern methods on the farm, in the home and in the
factory. You realize that the human race practically stood still for
centuries.
Progress wa3 impossible until the coming of steel plows and the
application of steam.
In the old days the best brains could be developed and trained
only if the owners belonged to the nobility, who had no time except
leisure time. Poor- men, like Aesop the fable genius, were all slaves too
.tired after the day's work to turn thought into action.
With the coming of steam and steel plows, fewer slaves were needed.
The machinery displaced them did their work. Then the vast brain
lying dormant in the masses sa,w the light, pronounced it good, and
hastened to produce more labor-saving inventions.
Sirloins and Pork Chops Though Heavens Fall
Mr. American Citizen insists on one thing; that he eat regularly.
Js'ofthat ho lunch, or guzzle noodles, or attempt to beguile his insides
with rice and a soup bone. . '
No Bir, when he says eat he means a good, thick 6teak, or a trio
of pork chops, with eggs, potatoes, and butter, and white bread, and
coffee, and pie with a lard crust, and plenty under and above said crust.
And he doesn't give a hoot if pork chops are $1 each.
They tried to sell him horsemeat, but they didn't.
They endeavored to show him the delights of a savory whale
steak, but they didn't. ' i
And they didn't induce him to try the cheaper cuts of meat and
spice them up French style.
No siree, he wants his pork chops well, and his steak rare, and his
Frerich fried, and hi3 eggs, and four slices of bacon.
Buthcers tell'us that when pork chops were 50 cents a pound they
sold as many pounds as they did when they were 20 cents.
The demand for fresh eggs was about as eager when they were 85
cents as when they were 50 cents.
About as much cream" is used In America at 20 cents a half pint
as when milk sold for a nickel a quart.
We insist on having enough to eat of the best cuts; enough butter
fat3, enough wheat bread, enough cane and beet sugar, and enough
fresh xegetables. '
After all is there a better way to spend your money than to insure
you continued efficiency, and the proper nourishment of your children?
And those who insist that an honest-to-John Yank can be nourished
on coolie grub, or on mush, beans, boiled hoofs and horns, or the third
cutlet from the tip of the cow's tail can guess aain. lie doesn't even
care for fish except one in a while.
Wherever food prices may climb Mister American Workingman will
be found "ascending right alongside; breathless and disheveled, porhaps,
but there.

fested with these destructive pests
since January 1. The farmers with
small holdings and homesteaders are

let the ladies in on choosing the next
president.
In order to ratify the amendment
in time for the 1920 elections at least
25 state governors would have to sum
mon the legislatures in special ses
sion! The chances' are that that will NQT
be done!
As a result, the women in the 23
states already enjoying full or presi
dential suffrage as a result of state ac
tion, will be the only ones to partici
pate in the next na-ionaf elections,
while their sisters who have just at
tained the vote by federal amendment
keep on waiting patiently.
Five states, Louisiana, Kentucky,
Maryland, Mississippi and Virginia,
hold legislative sessions in 1920, and
might be expected to give five ratify
ing votes except that they are all
part of the "solid south." the strong
hold ot anti-suffrage and cannot reas
onably be counted on to endorse rn
amendment.
Six other "states, Georgia, Massa
chusetts, New Jersey, New York,
Rhode Island and South Carolina, hold
annual Instead of bi-ennial legislative
sessions, and so might possibly add
six votes of ratification. But, even
should the five southern states and
the six annual session states all ratify
the suffrage amendment their total of
11 votes would still leave 25 state rati
fications needed to complete the 36 re
quired. And all of the" 25 would have to be
summoned in special session to vote!
Therefore the old-time politicians
who count .on "influence" and "con
trol" and "tied-up 'votes will not have
to He awake nights worrying over the
unknown quantity of the women's vote
THIS election.
At the same time, while suffragists
will he unable to take full advantage
of their new franchise privilege in
November, 1920, the vote of women
will be of considerable Importance in
that election.' .
Fifteen states grant their women
full suffrage, their total female popu
lation of women eligible to vote num
bering 7,303,288, with a total of 137
electoral votes.
Eight other states grant women
presidential suffrage, with approxi
mately 4,000,000 women voters and 97
electoral votes. Two more states give
women the vote at presidential pri
maries. ..The grand total of women who may
freely approach the 1920 ballot boxes,
independent of the federal amendment
are in number, 13,000,000, controlling
263 electoral votes and representing
25 states of the union.
The suffrage amendment has been
finally accepted by congress and
the Benate in 1919 was drafted by
Susan B. Anthony in 1875, and Is
known as the Anthony amendment
It was first introduced in the senate
in 1878 by Sargent ot California.
Thirty times 6ince it has been intro
duced, and defeated or tabled.
The United States senate has passed
on suffrage four times. In 1887 suf
frage received. 16 ayes and 34 noes:
In 1914 it received 35 ayes and 34

One carload of apricots went out
last night and another will go out to
night. It is possible there will be
regular daily shipments east from now
on until the crop is worked off.
Vegetables for theniost part wers

mand for most of the stock on hand,
with supply sufficient to meet it. This
is the first day in several that this
condition has prevailed, the complaint
being formerly that it was impossible !
to get enough vegetables to supply the I
demand. i
Berries of all varieties were scarce.
There is no relief in sight. Canta
loupes were ip heavy demand with a
supply far too small to fill the orders.
The cantaloupes coming in are choice,
but no fancy stock has yet been re
ceived. Prices remain firm.
Some peaches were in market along
with a scattering of plums and other
back doors, though it is not believed
the same person, or persons, were re
sponsible for all of the robberies.
The thieves drank a quantity ot
sweet milk at one of the grocery
stores and buttermilk at the othei-,
and took a bunch of pennies from
each store. At the De Luxe about
50 pennies and a half dozen boxes of
candy comprised the loot. Officers say
both robberies were committed by
persons familiar with the places.

Lowell. Ariz.. April 20. 1919M ' For about 15 mouths. I have been try
ing everything that iH on the market for cczoma. with very little benefit.
Finally one of my friends advised me to try Number 40, which I did. I
have now used nine bottles and am sure it has done me lots of good and in
time think it will cure the disease, which is deep seated, and may take
from 12 to 18 months to eradicute. I have great faith in Number 40 and am
going to stay by it. 1 do not hesitate to recommend it to any of my
friends. I know of two men working with me who are now taking it with
splendid results." Yours very truly, George Nicholson. Witness to tUfiature
George i,evinline. Number 40 for the tflood is. demanded in depraved con
ditions of the, system, especially of the blood and general bad health. In
chronic enlargement of glauds, enlargement of liver and spleen and in
chronic: malarial poisoning. Removes the causo of disease by stimulating

I WILLARD FLOORED BY
HIMSELF IN GLASSY
. DISPLAYJD F BOXING
TOLEDO, June 6. Jess Willard and
Jack Dempsey will meet in their
heavyweight championship contest
here July 4, whether there is a clear
sky or a driving rainstorm. Tex
Rickard, promoter of the contest,
made this announcement tonight in
denying reports that the contest might
be postponed until the next day be
cause of inclement weather.
Rickard announced that although
the contest is a month away, the ad
vance sale had reached the astonish
ing total of $300,000. This indicates,
it was said, that the total gate receipts
will exceed 600,000.
It became known tonight that Wil
lard Is after Clay Turner, the Indian
light heavyweight, Harry Greb of
Rittsburg and Bartley Madden, an
oth"er light heavyweight, to work with
him. It is contended that the cham
pion has boxed with the sparring
mates already in camp so often that
he knows all their moves and that
this is harmful in his preparation for
a gruelling contest.
The champion intended to do five
miles on the road . this morning, but
he became lost in the outskirts of the
city and covered seven miles before
reaching home. In the afternoon he
boxed six rounds, three each with Jack
Hempel and Walter Monahan, worked'
with the pulleys and wrestled. The
champion fell to the floor of the ring
during his set-to with Hempel when
he missed a punch and became over
balanced. The crowd' of spectators
roared over his spill.
Johnny Kilbane, the featherweight
champion, fttarted a lively argument
today on the advisability of training
in the sun for a contest to be fought
in the sun. Kilbane, who trained for
five 20-round contests in the open in
California, claims it is unwise for
Dempsey and Willard to work with !
the blazing rays of the sun beating
down on their unprotected heads.
"No boxer ever lived that could
train under the burning heat for sev
eral weeks and not have his vitality
sapped," Kilbane said. "The idea that
a boxer should train in the sun to
harden himself to conditions likely to
prevail when he goes into battle is
wrong. They should train in the cool
of the day and then they will not be
robbed of their energy."

Its 12 Wonderful Ingredients
Simply Make You Over
There are remedies which act on the liver5, remedies which help
the nerves; remedies which influence the stomach and intestines.
But never before has such a remedy as Flaxolyn been
compounded.
It acts on the stomach, the large and small intestines, the
bladder, the kidneys, the stomach, the liver, the lungs, the nerves.
It gives the human machine a general overhauling.
You begin after the first few doses to feel like a new person.
Flaxolyn is a powder and extremely convenient and easy to take.
It can harm nobody. It contains no drugs to form habits, no
alcohol to stimulate.
Dr. H. H. LunU. the well known Alsatian physician, spent 20
years developing the Flaxolyn formula. He broke his health
down. Was stricken with nervous collapse. His own remedy,
Flaxolyn. cured him. This is one of the rare cases where a
doctor took his own medicine.
There are 30 Flaxolyn powders in a packaije. Take one pow
der in a wine glass of water 30 minutes before each meal. Stir
slightly until dissolved.

TRADE IMPROVEMENT SEEN
NEW YORK, June 6. Bradstreet's
tomorrows will say:
Wholesale and retail trade' and in
dustrial conditions are more uniformly
favorable than at any previous time
this year and the chief source of com
plaint in distributive trade now is
that present, active demand is reval
Ing past ultra conservatism in recog
nizing shortages of merchandise in
many lines. Especially Is this noted
in retail lines which have spurted un
der the stimulus of summer months.
The only lack of favorable uniformity
is that noted in crop reports from the
south where continued rains are put
ting cotton further in the grass, and
from the southwest, where harvesting
of a bumper, wheat crop is interfered
with by the same trouble. On the
other hand, much needed rains have
helped .spring wheat and newly plant
ed corn, and farther east, Warm weath
er has quickened growth on farms
and in gardens. The tenor of whole
sale trade reports is as good as ever
in all line3 and better in some hither
to lagging trades.
Weekly bank clearings $6,997,663,-
00C.
THE WOOL MARKET QUIET
BOSTON, June The Commercial
Bulletin tomorrow, will say:
"The week has been quieter both
here and in the west, although some
some ' business in the fine and half
blood wools at prices about on the
present level . of cost for- the iew
wools. Buying in' the west has con
tinued with less eagerness at about
the level of values prevailing a week
ago.
"Foreign markets are all holding
firm with competition fairly steady at
the river Plate The goods market is
on a farm basis."
Scoured basis: Texas, fine, 1
bontha, $1.501,53; fine 8 months.
$1.301.35. ; "
THE GRAIN MARKETS
CHICAGO, June 6 Reduction of
holdings to comply with the 200,000
bushel maximum limit in force after
tomorrow did muthtoday ,to weaken
the corn market. 7 Prices closed ner
vous, lc to lc net lower with
July $1.68 to $1.69 and September
$1.59 to $1,659. Oats lost c
to lc. Provisions finished all the way
from 35c decline to a like advance.
Although occasional rallies took
place, in corn, they failed to hold for
auy considerabl etime. It was cvi
dent that there were more big longs
than shorts. A side, too, from prepa
rations to meet the maximum limit
rule, bears had the advantage owing
to auspicious weather conditions and
to a sharp break in the value of hogs
Moreover, unrest In the labor world
appeared to exert a distinct weaken
ing influence and so likewise dil re
ports that food needs abroad were less
urgent. In addition, Argentine offer
ings so this country were said to be
on the increase.
Oats gave way with corn and as a
result of the excellent crop outlook
Seaboard buying had but little coun
ter agency.
Exaggerated talk of government re
selling put a weight on the provisions
market and intesified the depressing
effect from downturn' of grain and
hogs. Packers bought on the breaks.

been reluctant to venture far down the
street when crowds were thick to find
a jitney in which to ride.

bee have been working on the plan to
relieve ' this ' situation for several

state.
Artenuff was nervous and appre
hensive all the time that the sheriff
was with him, declares McDonald. He
was seeking eternally to draw out the
sheriff and to secure from him a state
ment which would indicate how far
the investigation, ofi his wife's dis
appearance had gone tn Arizona.
Officers under McDonald will begin
a systematic search on the Artenuff
ranch in the vicinity of Stark as soon

discover tne Doay or tne missing wo

has been buried some place on this
ranch. 'Artenuff, however, did not in
dicate what disposition of the body he
had made.' , ;
In the hat hand of ArtenufTa .hat
was a note after he bad killed him
self. The message did not state, where
the body had been hid. , It was a ramb
