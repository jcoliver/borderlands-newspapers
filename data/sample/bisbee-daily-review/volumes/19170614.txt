! victims to the explosions. In one instance alone ten children
were killed in a street and 50 were injured.
British airplanes ascended- immediately after the signal

the Liberty Loan apparently

one-half days before the closing of the

Announcement was based on actual

accompanied by the two. per cent of
subscriptions required.
A tremendous eleventh- hour drive
throughput the,nation, officials hope,
will bring the final count of dollars
well beyond the $2,000,000,000 mark.
The only tangible evidence on which
to base an estimate, however, are the
returns from the reserve banks at the
close of business last night. These
show total actual subscriptions of $1,

15 GERMAN PLANES
DEAL DEATH DURING
RAID OVER LONDON
(Contini'eo I'rom i'age One)
I think we are safer here than any
where else."
After a few moments the judge an
nounced: "I understand the raid has
ccme as far 83 this tut now has gone
away, so we will proceed with the
case unless it returns."
A squad of at least five airplanes
appeared over the east end district,
although it is impossible to say
whether one or more of tfiem was
not British, as the Bn'fish aircraft
were pursuing the Germans and were
flying at a great height.
Foreign Population
s Calm During Raid.
The east end stood the strain of
the raid well and there was no panic
such as one might expect to find
among a population of this class,
which is largely foreign. Business
was at a standstill in many sections
for a few minutes and great throngs
gathered about the wrecked buildings,
but they were orderly crowds, bent on
seeing what damage the Germans bad
done. And there was plenty 6f dam
age to, see, for scores of buildings had
suffered and more than one was still
smoking from fires which the engines
were working upon.
Throughout the bombed area there
was a steady movement of ambulanc
es, collecting the injured and rushing
them to a hospital. Ope hospital,
which has teen used largely for
wounded soldiers, probably got more
patients than any other in this sec
tion. These soldirl's ' did yeoman's
work as the injured arrived, not car
ing for those hurt, but in giving
comfort to relatives and encourage
ment of the fate of those being car
ried within.
Murder Of Women and
Children Accomplished.
While the damage done in the east
end was widespread it is probable
that the monetary loss will not be
heavy, for many of the buildings
wrecked were those of small business
men. The raid had been over but a
short time when .the king motored
through the district His promptitude
j in thus - manifesting sympathy with
those an acted apparently was deeply
appreciated. Later the king visited
the hospitals.
The main result of todav's raid, a
. in past cases, has been the killing of
civilians, including many children. No
I military damage w as done. It was not
I a case of accurate dropping of bombs
I when once the planes were ov r the
j city. In the east end, for instance,
j a tomb could not have len dropped
I without doing damage.. The course
! the ra:ders took can eas:!y be faced
I by the damaged buildings, which in
I many cases are close together.
, In some places a whole block of
buildings is lacking ever;' wndow ;:nd
much other damage was done. One
school in this district had a lucky es
cape. There were a thousand pupils
in that schxri and fifteen minutes af
ter the little ones returned to the
building from recess a bomb fell
where hundreds of them had been
gathered.

THE BISBEE WAY.
In Bisbee's participation in the Liberty Loan, the
people of this community may well take unto them
selves just and deserved pride. The workingmen of
the Warren District have, particularly, distinguished
themselves, their home and their country by the man.
ner in which they met the request for subscriptions to
the Loan. It Is indeed a pttriotic service.
Cochise county was allotted $796,000 by the Federal
Reserve bank in Dallas, Texas. Bisbee, alone, has
oversubscribed the amount. Douglas also oversub
scribed the amount and no figures are obtainable from
the other region of the county.
We take particular pride, however, in the fact that
the workingmen of the Warren District have risen to
the occasion so well. 1500 men, in the employ of the
Copper Queen Branch of the Phelps Dodge Corpora
tion, in Bisbee, subscribed for $193,500 of Liberty
bonds. Calumet and Arizona has not reported, as its
subscription books will not be closed for some time,
but its total Is expected to compare favorably, in pro- (
portion, to the other subscription.
The manner in which the pecple of the District
responded Is proof positive of the sentiment in the
region. It Is solidly patriotic, the exceptions -being
the proof of the general rule.
- If all communities can report as favorably as can
Bisbee, the issue in the great struggle now going on
can never be in doubt. It is a united country which
has responded to the call for silver bullets, with
which to puncture the armor plate of German autocracy.
CONSTITUTIONAL GREECE.
Constantine IL King of the Hellenes is gone. ConstT
tutional monarchy is again established in Greece and
Prince Alexander, second son of the former sovereign, is
at the head of the European cradle of democracy. Again
Wilhelm, war lord of the Central Powers, remains, at his
demesne and wonders whether the entire world will not
Same against the fame and fortunes of modern autocracy.
To many people of the Western Hemisphere Greece and
its position has been an enigma since the opening of
general hostilities in the present war. Greece has been
charged with every kind of activity: from that of being in
league with the Entente Allies to being the catspaw of
the German Emperor. And there is considerable argu
ment to be advanced on each side.
To the little country in Southeastern Europe, known
in history and in the classics and the actual cornerstone
of democracy, the modern world owes much. It was there
that the candle of liberty burned brightly when "Omnia
Gallia est divisa in partes tres"; when the Vikings made
inroads in France and when the wild hog and the un
tamed savage romped and made merry on the downs of
England; when America was, perhaps, in the hands of It
latest cave dwellers.
From their earliest kown history the Greeks have been
devoted to constitutional government and that the na
tional integrity of belief should have come down to the
present day, in the face of its many rebuffs, seems in
credible. Greece has been the football of nations, the
stepping stone of conquerors and the battlefields of kings.
In spite of that the Greeks, in whatever part of the
world they may be found, revere their ancient traditions
and seek for their beloved Hellas that liberty of thought
and of action which characterized the triumphant Greece
of old.
Modern Greece's history has been written in blood. Its
Christianity has been butchered and plundered and has
been saved time and again because of the country's
strategic position.
In 1421, after years of domination at the hands of the
Turks, preece revolted. During the several years which
followed the Turks massacred thousands of people in
that fair country. This, however, whetted the appetite
of the Greeks. But for the intervention of the European
nations,' notably England, France and Russia, by the Lon
don Protocol calling for an armistice, Greece would have
lost. The Sultan refused and the battle of Navarino Bay
followed on October 20. 1827. in which the Turkish and
Egyptian fleets were destroyed. In the London agreement
of 1S30 Greece was declared an Independent kingdom.
Prince Otho, of Bavaria, was made king.
Under King Otho. .however, constitutional government
was not a reality and the Creeks wanted democracy
After years of restlessness the Greeks, animated by a
regenerated Italy, struck for a constitutional Greece In
1S62. King Otho failed to receive the support of the
great European, nations and was forced to leave the
country. The choice for the new sovereign fell upon the
second son of the King of Denmark, who became George
I, of Greece. England ceded to Greece the Ionian Islands,
seven in number, and the star of that country seems again
to be in Hs ascendency.
Crete became the nest stumbling block of Greece, in
that the famous Island desired liberty from the oppres
sion of the Turks. This gave the war party in Greece
the opportunity sought and trouble was instigated in
Macedonia. On the 17th of April, 1897 the Sublime Porte
declared war against Greece and the campaign which fol
lowed was the series of reverses against Greece. The
Turk advance was stopped when Russia promptorily de
manded an armistice. Greece was forced to pay an in
demnity. of $18,000,000 and in 1898 Turkey was obliged,
by the powers, to release Crete. Prince George, who has
Just abdicated the Greek throne as Constantine, was made
Governor General of that Island. '
During the several Balkan wars Greece was into trouble
as much of the time as any other nation. In i the last
war, which spelled defeat for Bulgaria at the hamls of
the Greeks and Serbs the two allied Balkan nations en
tered into a defensive treaty against Bulgaria. It pro
vided that should either Greece or Serbia be attacked by
Bulgaria the other nation should respond to the call and
support the other.
This obligation entered into by the Greeks has been the
chief cause for dissention on the part of the, liberal party
in Greece, especially since Bulgaria entered the European
war on the side of the Central Powers. Constantine,
however, was swayed either by an honest desire for neu
trality or by the influence weilded by his wife, the sister
of the German Emperor, and his son, the Crown Prince
and pursued a middle course.
Gradually the gulf between the liberals, led by Veni-
telos, and the King's party widened and during the last
few months its width has seemed insurmountable. The
bridge broke In Its entirety Tuesday and the liberal party
of Greece is again in command. Constantine, with the
Crown Prince, will leave Greece, never again, in all prob
ability, to set foot on the. soil of his father, and of his
adopted race.
European politics are complex at best, but European
politics, mixed with those in the Balkans, constitute a
question over which the most emminent statesmen of the
day are wont to wrangle. Consequently when the present
status of Greece is considered there will be many opin
ions and all or none may be rglht
On the face of the action, however, it appears that an
other true democracy has been added to the list now in
actual or theoretical opposition to German Kaiserism.

THE MOLOKANS.
Thirty seven Russian religious zealots, called Molo
kans, or Molokani, have been released from the Maricopa
xmnty jail on $100 bond, each, to appear in court and ans
wer to the charge of evading the federal registration law.
The actions of this sect of people, who in every other
way, are commendable and desirable citizens., is, and will
remain, one strange episodes of America's entrance into
the war.
.Apparently, understanding everything regarding the
registration law, the Molokans, through their leader, de
clared that two years ago the Holy Ghost had appeared to
one of them and, in a revelation, had advised them not
to register when the time came. On that ground all of
those amenable to the federal statute refused to sign the
uecessary blanks on June 5 and were committeed to jail.
The Molokans may be properly termed the Protestants
Jf Russia. They do not subscribe to the tenats or teach
ings of the Orthodox Greek Church, which is the domin
ant religion In that country. They call themselves Spirit
ual Christians. They are rationalists, basing and practice
on the Scriptures interpreted by the individual judgment.
This leads to much diversity of opinion among them but,
apparently, the Phoenix colony acted as a whole unit on
the matter of registration.
That the Molokans are desirable residents is acknow
ledged. That their religious doctrines are absurd, as ap
plied to their present case, would also seem to bex ap
parent The federal department of justice, represented
by the United States Attorney for the District of Aribona.
low has charge of the case. There are some miligating in
fluences in the affair in view of he persecutions of the
Molokans in their native country and in view of their
peculiar religious beliefs.. On the other hand it would
seem that, with their acceptance of American laws and
American largess, these strange people might, at least,
accept the revelation of the Holy Ghost as interpreted
by American clergymen and laymen. Otherwise, they
must suffer as an American must suffer, for a transgres
sion of the law.
On none of the war fronts has been
an engagement of noteworthy import
ance. Nearly 100 persons were killed
and more than 400 injured in a mid
day bomb dropping raid by some 12
to 15 German airplanes over London,
particularly the east end, where live
the poorer classes of the population.
Ten of those killed and fifty of those
wounded were children 'in a school in
in the east end.
General Pershing and the members
of his stiff were greeted with enthu
siasm when they landed at Bologne.
The American commander and his
party proceeded to Paris.
Aside from raiding operations by
the British troops in France and inter
mittent artillery duels between the
Germans and French in Belgium in the
region of Craonne there has been lit
tle activity along the French front
Minor operations continue on the
Austro-Hungarian-Italian fronts.

Trade Commission.
(By Review Leased Wire)
WASHINGTON, June 13. Announc
ing failure of its plan to relieve he
news print paper situation, and pre
dicting panic prices unless the gov
ernment steps in, the federal trade
commission today asked congress to
authorize a government pooling
scheme to insure an equal distribu
tion to consumers and a fair profit to
manufacturers.
Under the new plan all producing
plants would be operated on govern
ment account and a federal agency
would be created to get a fair price
and effect fair distribution. The Can
adian government would be asked to
create a similar agency to act jointly
with officials in this country in dis
tributing the big Canadian output The
recommendation is the outcome of
months of investigation by the com
mission which undertook the inquiry
in response to a senate resolution. The
commission hopes for action on its
recommendations at this session of
congress as it regards the situat.'jn
facing publishers as a war emergency
requiring speedy relief measures.
The commission also submitted to
the senate today a report on book pa
per which showed that book paper
manufacturers have made enormous
profits within the last year. The com
mission announces it is considering in
stituting proceedings against certain-
practices which exist in the industry.

THE WHISKEY TAX.
Some rude critics are pointing out that the joy of the
prohibitionists over the heavy tax the senate finance
committee proposes to lay on grain used for distlling
liquor is prematire. This tax of $20 a bushel on the grain,
the critics say, wil have one good effect the conservation
of many million bushels of grain for use as food. But
it will not stop the whisky-drinking, because there is
laid to be' enough whisky now stored in bond to last the
country for about three years.
The real benegclaries of the measure, say the critics,
will be the distillers, dealers and speculators who hold
this vast quantity of whisky. The tax amounts to about
$5 on every gallon of liquor made. Every gallon already
in bonds will therefore take on the much additional value
Thus congress. If it passes the bill, will make the whisky
interests a gift of several hundred million dollars.
Evidently the matter will bear looking into a little

BY REVIEW
(By Review Leased Wire).
"NEW YORK, June 13. The market

primarily on the, overnight decision of
the directors forTthe United Steel Cor
poration to declare another "extra"

stock for the current Quarter, virtual
ly Insuring, It Is believed, full divi
dend returns of 17 per cent on the
common shares roc the caienaar year,
United States Steel was absorbed
In countless lots of 1.000 to 20.000
shares, the price rising to 134, an
overnight advance of 3?4 points, and
closing at 133: At, its top steel
equalled 138, including recent divi-
dend payments, and exceeded Its pre -
vious maximum ty of a point.
General increase of demand was
manifested in all parts of the railway
division, the inquiry ranging from
nigh grade Investments to .many of
the low priced or recognized roads.
Fxtreme gains of one to over three
points marked the trading In these
stocks, but these too; were partly re
duced on realization.
Total sales 1.245.000 shares.
Yet another low record for rubles
and slight easing of lires were the
features of the exchange market.

CHICAGO GRAINS.
CHICAGO, June 113. Optimisitio
forecasts from the Dakotas, Minneso-
ta, and some other sections tended to
cause a decline in wheat today. The
market, although steady, at the close
was to 2 cents net lower with July
at 231 and September at 207. Corn
finished to 2 up and oats gained
to 1. The outcome In provisions j
was a seioacn oi tyi 10 a ccius.
A leading authority on wheat esti-
mated the 1917 production in North
and South Dakota and Minnesota at
160.00O.0C0 bushels as against 88,000,
000 bushels last year. There also were
continued favorable reports from Can
ada. '
Advices from Missouri, Kansas and
ether winter wheat states pointed to
a harvest above the average.
Corn rallied sharply from an early
selling rush that was due to expected
warmer, veather. '
Firmness in the oats market devel
oped In the main from signs of a lib
eral export demand. July delivery
was In especially good request.
Liquidating sales by holders weak
ened provisions. Most of the pressure
was on lard and ribs.
