to reduce confusion to a minimum.
To this end attention was directej
today to various sections of the regu

arisen and it was suggested that the
local boards and the press co-operate

ASHINGTON, July 16. A wran
gle over President Wilson's ap
pointment of Herbert C. Hoov
er as food administrator occu
pied virtually all today's debate in tne
senate on the food control bill, ou
meantime considerable progress on
compromise amendments was made by
the leaders in bi-partisan conferences.
For more than two hours Senator
Reed criticized Mr. Hoover, declaring
his residence abroad had kept him out
of touch with American ideals. Sen
ator Phelan replied, defending the
food administrator as a patriotic and
efficient official.
Board Decided Upon
The Democratic and Republican
leaders agreed in their conference
upon changes in the bill expected to
command general support, including
an amendment creating a board of food
administration instead of one man
control, provided in the house meas
ure. Most of the leaders also agreed
upon limiting the control legislation to
food, feeds and fuels, the fuels to in
clude gasoline and kerosene.
Another conference will be held to
morrow by the leaders with a meeting
of the senate Democratic steering com'
mittee planned later for final negot'a
tion toward a complete compromise.
OVEMENT was started in the district yesterday for the wis
ing of fund through public subscription for the erection of
monument in the square in front of the postoffice to the
memory of Orson P. McRae. The Workmen's Loyalty league,
the Citizen' Protective league, the Commercial club, Sheriff Harry
C Wheeler, Mayor Jacob Ericksan and the city government are en
gaged in support of the-movement and will further it with all the
effort then can put forth.
The Workmen' Loyalty league will take a particularly strong
part. It is the nope of all who are interesting themselves that the
subscription will be closed this week. Organization to that end was
completed last night and subscription paper will be in circulation
today.
Not less than ten cents nor more than twenty-five cent will be
accepted on the subscription papers. The name of each contributor
is desired, in order that the complete list may be placed in the cor
ner atone of the bronze monument to the patriot, which i planned.
By placing the subscription at the nominal sum which na been fix
ed, every man, woman and child In the district can have the honor
of taking part in the erection of the monument, lt this way the spirit
of the movement is the big thing with each indivdual and not th
money. '
- It is felt by those advancing the plan that not only doe the dis
trict owe the recognition to the loyalty and true patriotism of Orson
P. McRae, but that it owes it to itself. The monument will be a re
minder during all the remainder of the history of the district of the
patriotism of .which its people are capable as Americans, unto the
very last step in the. 'sacrifice of life.
In Arizona the monument will stand as marking the first life to
have been given from among it American manhood in the present
war given in conflict with enemies of the country and wholly in
the spirit of service to the flag.

Local Boards' Limitations.
Officials here are anxious that local
boards make it clear everywhere that
no question of exemption of any reg
istered man for any other cause than
physical disability or depednent rel
atives can be taken up before the loc
al boards. The whole matter of in
dustrial exemptions is left to the su
perior boards, one of which has been
created in each federal judicial dis
trict. No individual case where exemption
is desired because the registrant is
engaged in an industry classified as
vital to the conduct of the war, will be
taken up uutil that individual has been
called up for examination by his local
board, found to be without dependents
and physlcially fit for military duty
and certified to the superior boards.
After that, application to the superior
board for exemption on other grounds
will be admissible. The registrant or
his employer may file necessary af
fidavits with the superior board seek
ing exemption and the case will be
heard promptly.
Absent Registrants. j
Another point on which there has
been much debate has been the status
of the registrants absent from their
registration districts. Scores of re-

Breach Widens in
Shipping Council
(By Review Leased Wire.)
" WASHINGTON. July 16.-The gov
ernment's merchant ship building pro
gram was halted today when Major-
General Goethals, manager of the ship
ping board's .fleet corporation, post
poned his plan to requisition all steel
merchant ships under construction and
to let contracts for building two gov
ernmentowned shipyards for producing
fabricated steel ships.
At general Goethals' office it was
stated the postponement was due to
a request by Chairman Denman of the
shipping board for a short delay to
give the board time to go over the
program. This was denied at the
shipping board, although the state
ment was made that General Goethals
had been asked to supply additional
information concerning his plans.
Issue Near Head.
Today's development was regarded
as bringing to a direct issue the
question of who is to have supreme
authorityjn carrying out the building
program Chairman Denman or Gen
eral Goethals. Authority to spend
$750,000,000 for acquiring a great mer
chant fleet, given to President Wilson,
provided in an executive order be
tween the shipping board and its cor
poration, the board is being authorized
to acquire vessels by purchase and
the corporation to take charge of the
building.
Denman "Horns" In.
In announcing his program last Fri
day, General Goethals apparently as
sumed that as manager of the corpora
tion be would be given a free hand,
but Mr. Denman in a statement to
night assumes responsibility for the
shipping board, whose members are
directors and stockholders of the cor
poration. Differences Exist.

Lieut. C. O. Bailey ,a surgeon in the
medical corps, was one of the doctors
who examined Cafado after his body
was found. He found tonight that the
sentry's throat had been cut oy a very
sharp instrument "undoubtedly a
knife."
Cafado Was Called
According to the testimony present
ed to the board of officers a corporal
kin company with a private who was
to relieve Cafado, walked along the
track to within 75 feet of where he
was stationed and called him several
times but received no response. They
returned to camp for a searchlight, as
it was a stormy night and before they
returned the train passed.
The board of officers believed that
bad Cafado been alive before the train
passed he would have responded to
the calls of the men who were looking
for him.
Excitement Prevail
Intense excitement prevails through
out the district tonight over Carat? o-s

agents here are also detailed to the
case.
Cafado was a close friend of another

About half the mines in the Flat

i Luther Price, after being brought
I to the county jail, upon surrendering

developed a case of small pox. The

j where he got the case. He had es-
taped from a prison case in Greenlee
county some weeks before while serv-
ing a life sentence in the state penil
tentiary for murder and had voluntari
ly given himself up.
On Sunday Dr. Hunt drove to Light
in an effort to trace the small pox. He
arrived at the Price family home and
found that six cases existed in the
family. From the information he
gathered, it would appear that one
of the sons, William, on May 16, had
remained in Douglas and had been ex
posed while there. After he returned to
the ranch he exposed the other mem

MICHAELIS APPOINTMENT
DEATH OF PARLIAMENTARIAN
(Bv Revjew Leased Wire.)
COPENHAGEN, July 16. If the
Herman nress correetlv reflects nublic
i opinion on the event, the appointment
1 ct George Michaelis as imperial chan
: cellor will be associated with the death
' of the movement to parliamentarize
j the imperial chancellorship by giving
! Reichstag members seats either in tha
cabinet or in a new controlling body
I to be created, such as the proposed
imperial council of representatives.
The press of Bavaria and other
: states was quick to point out that a
parliamentary ministry could not be
introduced without upsetting the whole
federal character of the empire, which
finds expression in the supreme bun
desrath. The alternative idea, which
Dr. von Bethniann-Hollweg actually
considered for a time, namely the in
stitution of an imperial council con-
sisting of five representatives each of
the government, the bundestrath and
the reichstag, to serve as a connect
ing link between the government and
representatives institutions of the na
tions, had been proposed, according to
the Catholic newspaper Germania.

NEW YORK. July 16. The cleavage
between rails and industrials assumed
wider proportions in the stock market
today, the former evincing a disnosi
tion to supplement last week's gains,
while the numerous equipments and
specialties almost without exception
were heavy when not actually weak.
War prices and taxes again enter
ed largely into speculative calcula
tions.
Money conditions distinctly favored
the short account, call loans rising to
10 per cent, the high rate of the year
United States Steel was the pivot
around which the market revolved
Steel made an extreme break of 34
points to 119, it lowest price in two
months. Bethlehem lost i and simi
lar Issues dropped from 2 to 4 points
Utah Copper was weakest of the
metals .breaking five points.
Trans-continentals were the sustain
ing features of the railway division.
Canadian Pacific gaining two points
at its best and Union Pacific 14. FT
nal prices were from fractions to two
points above minimum.
Total sales, amounted to 870,000
shares.
Bonds -were irregular throughout,
minor rails inclining to heaviness. Full
lots of the Liberty issue sold at 99
46-50 to 99 40-50. Odd lots varied from
part to 99. Total sales, par value ag
gregated $2,S60,000.
U: S. bonds of old issues were un
changed on call, the coupon 3's ad
vancing 1 per cent on a single sale.
CHICAGO GRAIN MARKET,
CHICAGO, July 16. Sharp breaks
in the value of corn today resulted
from inference that on the subject of
peace the German Reichstag was de-
fy'ng the Kaiser.
Wheat finished unsteady at V to i
advance with $2.05 for July and fl.95
for September.
Oats lost to 1 and provisions 10
to 22.
Houses with eastern connections
were prominent in selling of corn
which was generally regarded as for
the most part liquidating by longs.
Corn available for immediate ship
ment touched a new high price record
today despite the weakness which de
veloped in future deliveries. The
fresh top value was on No. 2 wheat at
$2 a bushel, an advance of 3 cents
since Saturday.
Wheat hardened a little in price, ow
ing perhaps to a falling off in the
United States visible supply total.
Enlarged offerings pulled down oats.
Provisions were under pressure.

NEW YORK. July 16. There was
scattered liquidation in the industri
als. There was nothing startling in
the international news. More atten
tion was directed to price fixing and
taxation program. The bank state
ment Saturday which was exceedingly
poor helped to have an unsettlement
effect on sentiment The sudden tight
ening in money was a surprise.
The rails displayed considerable
firmness. Occasional rallies due to
short covering may be witnessed from
time to time, but the general run of
influences of the moment do not lend
encouragement to the inauguration of
bullish tactics and we believe that the
liquidating movement has not culmi
nated. IXGAN & BRYAN.

mine strikes and there was plenty ol evidence to support
It. No tribe or tool or talker is too small or too large or
too evil for the uses of the Prussian propaganda to save
fie Berlin dynasty from its impending destruction.
THE LAWLESS APPEAL TO THE LAW.
Beyond the pale of the law themselves in all their
acts, principles and propagandas, the I. W. W. horde
deported from Bisbee, now seek, not only the protection,
but the aid of the law. In other words, having been
rudely awakened from their dream of crippling Americiu
Industries during the term of the war, they ask the pro
tection of the government while they resume their nefari
ous task. And they would also invoke the law to assist
them In securing indemnity for their deportation.
It is as though the Germans should ask indemnity
from France for having occupied and devastated her ter
ritory. It required a lot of work and trouble for those
German spoilers to wreck all those fair villages. Ol'
course they should have pay.
It was very patriotic and unselfish on the part of
these German allies to come to Bisbee and stir up labor
troubles and promote and conduct a strike. And then.
Just when they had things going all right, to be driven
away! Of course they were not working or drawing any
pay (that is the rank and file were not, with the leaders
it was different), but they should have pay just the same
for their layoff in New Mexico, even though their tranv
portation was provided.
PROOF OF THE PRUSSIAN.
Many well-meaning and perfectly sensible people
merely laugh when the charge is made that the I. W. W.
agitators are in the employ of Prussian agents and are
encouraged and directed in their recent propagandas by
these enemies of the nation. "It is silly and absurd,"
they say. And that is what Germans all over this coun
try said when the first exposure was made of the German
plot to Incite Mexico to declare war upon the United
States. But it proved to be true. And this -last charge,
unreasonable and far-fetched as it may seem to some
folks, will also be proved true.
The Prussian engine of war is stalled right now and
the powers that be have decided that the one way out is
to either create dissension among the allies or hamper
their efforts from the inside of their own countries. Ger-j
man thoroughness is well known and its far-reaching
influence is only bordered by the horizon at the edges
of the earth.
No agency is too insignificant, no organization or
means too small. It is by the combination of the many
atoms that results are hoped for. A whirling dervish
in Egypt, a Hindu juggler, a Turkish eunich, an Arab
camel drivers' association, the coffee planters and banana
packers of South America, the German professors of
scores of universities throughout the world, the silk
workers of Marseilles, the cabbies of London, the canoe
men of the Yukon. German spies and agents have been
found in all these guises and in ail these lands.
1 Is it reasonable, then, to suppose, that this wide-
spread and highly organized system would overlook such
i apt pupils and fruitful soil as the I. W. W already avowed
enemies of all the greatest and best things that civiliza
' tion stands for?
1 The recent Socialist convention at Stockholm was
a Prussian assembly, organized, financed and animated
from the central battery at Berlin. The United States
government refused passports to the American delegates
and the Socialists and anarchists and pacifists and I. W.
i W. outfit of the country howled like wounded wolves at
i
Washington's tyranny.
A Prussian agent that neglected such tools as the
I W. sharpened and poisoned and placed ready to
his hand by years of outrage and treason and destruciton,
would be called back to Berlin and flogged at the cart's
tail.
And all through tho mountain section of the west,
where the'I. W. W. vermin liave propagated with, the
greatest fecundity of reecnt years, lie the great copper
mines, the most vital industry in the prosecution of mod
era war known to the world today. Would a well-in
fromed Prussian agent overlook this rich opportunity to
serve his country earnestly and well?
The strikes from the Canadian border to the Mexican
line were organized too thoroughly and carried out with
too much precision and by too much the same methods
not to have been planned by a master hand. They smack
of the Prussian spie and agent school at colse range and
miles away.
It is not an idle charge, this charge of German in
fluence behind the copper strikes. It is a stern, grave
charge, and it is backed by an overwhelming weight of
evidence that bhould well make all Americans consider
well this menace. The patience of this country and tho
slow wheels and many 6tops of its governmental machin
ery are proverbial, and well our foreign enemies know it.
They have weighed their chances and the time their
ready tools and agents migiit have to accomplish the ends
they have been set to bring about. Only one thing, so
far, has upset their dark conspiracy, the patriotism and
ndomitable spirit of the red-blooded people of the west
The intolerable shame of a passel of vagrants and
impudent agitators upsetting and demoralizing camps and
cities in a week that long years of toil and effort and
-money and manhood have been spent to build up coutd
not lone endure. And so it was that the mask was lifted
and the people and local authorities arose to instant ac
tion.
These strikes are a Prussian Plot and the disguise
was so thin that it was an insult to American'intelligence
It was so botd that it was positively impudent. Th
tools chosen were brazen in their effrontery. Only th
thoughtless have lpn deceived for a moment. The
has Yieen made in the American congress that
VllOl fc,
rnv.ar, influence aid SiObcy were beiud tie coppe
American naval officers and a rapidly increasing
number of all classes of people in England are demanding
an allied naval offensive against the U-boat bases. That
Is the one real solution of the submarine problem that
has so far been presented. As to whether it can be
accomplished or not, no one will know "until it has been
tried. It will doubtless be costly, axgue its supporters,
but the need for it is so imperative that the cost cannot
be considered. It is a bold stroke, and bold men love
to play the game that way. It is only bold strokes that
win wars. Of course Secretary Daniels opposes it. - But
then that was to be expected. The secretary is not of the
aggressive type. The British admiralty hesitates to em
ploy this means, but the B. A. is one of the most conserv
ative organizations In the world. The B. A. might well
profit by the success of the stroke that Bisbee made last
Thursday morning when she struck at the root of the
evil. All hard things look harder than they really are.
"To h 1 with the government" was one of the slo
gans of the I. W. W. during its propaganda here in the
Warren district. And yet this much maligned government
is feeding these disrupters now. They are even petition
ing this government, with mock bumiilty, to aid them in
their further efforts to hamper its conduct of the war.
But the activities of the I. W. W. have all been In one
direction for the past ten years, and that has been in
the opposite direction of good citizenship and the better
ment and the honor and glory of this country. Its repu
tation is evil in the land. And as a result the dangerous
rabble in the New Mexico detention camp has gained
sympathy only from the sob squad, which we have with
us always in the person of a few individuals who save
tbeir tears only for those stained with crime.
A definite idea may be gained of the efficiency and
energy of congress under war time stress from a para
graph of a recent news dispatch from the capital. It nar
rated how a certain senator made a long and exhaustive
speech on the food bill while exactly three Democratic
and five Republican senators were present in the cham
ber, and not one of them were paying the slightest at
tention to the statesman who was talking for a place in
the Congressional Record and free distribution in his dis
trict. Consider this bombastic foolishness and criminal
waste of precious time while the president and the nation
are demanding instant action on the food bill. Even a
great war cannot rout petty politics from its hold in con
gressional halls.

Not in recent years, perhaps, has
the coming of any public character

America's foremost leaders of ad

the Taniac treatment. He never
ceases to surprise you with the infi
nite variety of his knowledge, and its
absolute correctness and thoroughness.
In several of the larger cities, he has
done a great deal of relief work among
the poor.
Mr. Cooper is a firm believer In
practical philanthropy and his relief
work is familiar to charity workers
over the country. His Southern rep

workers, one thousand dresses of ex

children. In San Antonio the follow

sand dresses to the poor of that city
and a few days later four hundred of
the garments were provided by him
for the poor women and children of
GalveFton. Ladies prominent in so
cial life and many prominent citizens
of these places assisted and co-operated
with Mr. Cooper's representatives
in this worthy cause.

A police court judge in El Paso bids fair to solve the
I. W. W. problem for the southwest in a most satisfactory
manner. In the case of a man brought before him
charged with vagrancy, the judge asked this man as to
his habits, connections and means of livelihood. The
man replied that he was an I. W. W. "Fifty dollars." said
the judge, "and have him work it out" A dose like this,
repeated when occasion arose, and always given in time,
will go a long ways towards curing the disease. The
only trouble Is, that in this southwest country right
now, with demands for labor greater than ever before
in the history of the country, there are more loafers
and idlers than there is jail room.

The expresstve sign language of the western Indians
would be a great thing on the Flanders battle line, say
the experts who have been studying the needs of the sit
uation. A command simply caunot be heard two feet
distant when the drumlire begins. A system of signs
carefully studied and intelligently given would have saved
many bad breaks by the allies and given thcui many
opportunities to profit by the bad breaks of their foes.
And now especially, with American troops bivouacing in
French villages, a comprehensive sign language would be
of inestimable value a3 establishing some means of com
munication between the "Sammies" and their hosts and
brothers in arms.

WHEN MARRIAGE IS A FAILURE
Surely marriage is a failure when
Its essential purpose, the raising of a
family of children, proves impossible.
In the childless home the married
pair, though sometimes m'ore or less
unconscious of the fact, grow disap
pointe dand lonely. Lacking the best
tie to hold them together they are
likely to drift apart, hence many sep
arations and divorces.
If every wife, whose physical state
prevents motherhood, would but try
that great remedy, Lydia E. Pink
ham's Vegetable Compound, there
would be far fewer childless homes.
