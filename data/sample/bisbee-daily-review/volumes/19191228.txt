WILSON TO VETO
BILL IP STRIKE
CLAUSE PASSES
THE CONFERENCE
Gompers to Present Attitude
of Railroad Brotherhoods
on Cummins Act
HOUSE TO REJECT
SENATE MEASURE
Union Men Quote President's
Statement Upholding Right
to Use Power
WASHINGTON, D. C, Dec. 27.
The attitude of organized railway em
ployes toward the anti-strike provi
sion of the Cummins railroad bill will
be formarlly stated in a declaration
of principles to be drafted by the
heads of all the brotherhoods at a
conference here Monday with Presi
dent Gompers of the American Feder
ation of Labor.
Labor leaders declared today that
"nothing drastic was to be expected,"
but the general view among organized
workers was that the affiliated trades
would stand by the railway machin
ists' union, which voted to quit work
if congress enacted the anti-strike
provision. Senators and representa
tives now in Washington expressed
the opinion, however, that the house
never would accept the bill as it came
from the senate and that even if It
should pass, President Wilson would
veto it.
Labor leaders called attention to
this statement by the president in his
message to congress four weekB ago:
"The right of individuals to strike
is inviolate and ought not to be in
terfered with by any process of gov
ernment, but there is a predominant
right of tfte government to protect all
of its people and to assert its power
and majesty against the challenge of
any class."

DECKER HITS AT
OFFICE WARRIORS
Says His Office Kept Spain
Out. of World War "Despite
the Ambassador"
WASHINGTON, Dec. 27. Full in
vestigation of the controversy ovei
awards of decorations for war serv
ices to naval officers brought to a
head by Rear Admiral Wm. S. Sims'
recent protest against the tentative
list issued by the navy department,
will be made by congress and by the
department. ,
Representative Lufkin of the house
naval committee, today conferrea
with members of the senate commit
tee and stated that a joint commit
tee would take up the entire ques
tion when congress reconvened.
Representative Lufkin said Secre
tary Daniels, Admiral Knight, Admir
al Sims and other officers would be
called before the joint committee.
Changes made by Mr. Daniels in the
board list of awards as well as the
action of tlTe board .in each case, will
be examined, he said.
The names of Admiral Henry B.
Wilson, who commanded American
naval forces in French Waters during
the war, and of Rear Admiral Henry
T. Mayo, who was in command of the
Atlantic fleet during the period of
hostilities, were auded today to the
list of officers who have written the
secretary regarding the awards.
Kept Spain Out
Admiral Decker's letter notes that
he had been awarded a navy cross
under the published list in recogni
tion of his services as naval attache
at Madrid. "
"In my opinion," it says, "this
award is entirely inadequate to the
services that were performed by the
office of the naval attache and those
who worked with me. The effect of
this work was to keep Spain from en
tering the war against us at the time
of the enemy March offensive of 1918,
also a reduction of the submarine ac
tivities off the coast of Spain.
Hits at Shore Sailors
"If my estimate is correct," is con
tinued, "my services and the services
of those who worked with me, in
spite of the opposition of the ambas
sador, is certainly greater than the
work done by any single battleship in
the war or by any official stationed
on shore duty in an administrative
capacity."
Conference for Armistice Be

DORPAT. Friday. Dec. 26. A last

conference, extending far into Christ
mas morning, when the conference ad
journed after abandoning the attempt
to complete the "preliminary armis
tice" and with the question of peace
still in the balance.
According to the Esthonians, Joffe,
Russian Bolshevik delegate, departed
with the threat that he would bring
up additional divisions to compel the
Esthonians to submit to the Bolshe
vik terms. This would probably re
quire several weeks, and in the mean
time, the Esthonians say they will
keep careful watch to determine
whether the Bolsheviki will live up
to their agreement, and whether it is
possible to conclude "peace."

nary old jam, to spread on his
bread," said Meyers. "There was
plenty of marmalade, but he
wasn't satisfied and soon the first
note grew into a tune.
"Things happened 'thick and
fast.' First, the ship began to list
because the bilge pumps were
stopped while the chief engineer
worried about jam. Then some
thing went wrong with the oil feed
to the fires, and the first thing any
body knew the ship was out of
control. We had no heat and
drank all the ship's rum."

THREE BUTTLES
STANDING OF TEAMS II Mil
IN SEVEN DAYS
FOR J. MEYER
Johnny Meyer, Bishee welterweight
who has never teen beaten, is ubout
to achieve, foue second time in his
carr, the unusual feat of battling
in three different bouts within the
space of a single week.
Last night arrangements were made
with Meyer here by Art Shannon,
Tucson promoter, to meet Al Mc
Manus in a ten round main event in
the Old Pueblo on the night of Wed
nesday, December 31. Meyer Is also
signed for a six - round semi-final
with Ralph De Motte on the after
noon of New Year's Day in Douglas,
and has in .prospect a main evpnt
ten round bout with Chet Netf in
AJo on January 6.
Some months ago Meyer participat
ed in three bouts within a week, and
won every' one of them. He hopes
to repeat this unique record on this,
occasion.
The Bisbee welter will meet Mc
Manus In Elysian Grove, on the
night following the meeting of Kid
Palmer and Happy Woods in the
armory in the same city of Tucson.
He regards the? match as an import
ant one, and is determined to knock
McManus out, as such a feat will be
a considerable feather in his cap,
owing to the fact that McManus has
been appearing in main events in
various pVrts of Arizona during the
greater part of the year now ending.
Meyer figures that he has the edge
on McManus. as McManus fought a
draw with Pena in Ray on Christ
mas Day, while Meyer whipped Pena
soundly in six rounds in Tucson on
Hallowe'en night, and declares that
had the bout gone one more round
he would have knocked out his man.
McManus has also fought draws with
Ralph de Motte and Chet Neff.
Meyer believes that he will be In
perfect shape, after his fight with
McManus, to take on Ralph de. Motte
in Douglas the following day, but has
arranged with the Douglas promoters,
in the event, of his getting hurt, to
substitute Johnny Hughes of this
city as de Motte's opponent.

CALDWELL B 0 UT
Backed by a formidable record, In
Pacific coast boxing circles from Port
land to Los Angeles, Jack Rooney has
ntarted his training in Bisbee for his
ten-round bout with Walter Caldwell,
the New Mexico middleweight, in the
Opera house on the night of Thurs
day, January 8.
Rooney carries the title of Pacific
coast middleweight champion, but
calls attention to the fact that there
are other claimants, including Cliff
Jordan, with whom he fought a four
round draw in Los Angeles early in
the present month. Rooney has
fought the best men at his weight
158 pounds up and down the Pacific
coast, and has never been knocked
out. After several victories In Port
land, he set a record of eleven
straight wins, nine of them by the
knockout route, in Eureka. Calif. His
draw with Cliff Jordan was his last
fight before coming to Bisbee to take
on Caldwell.
Caldwell is no in Albuquerque,
where he meets Denver Jack O'Brien
in a 15-round bout which he is confi
dent of winning, on New Year's day.
He will return here on January 2,
and work out daily until the date of
his bout with Jordan.
A classy boxer wll make his bow to
Bisbee fans in Dick Cote of Los An
gees, who is matched to meet Kid

A THOUGHT FOR THE DAY
"Thy purpose firm is equal to the deed;
Who does the best his circumstance allows
Does well, acts nobly; Angels could no more."
Edward Young.
DEATH-DEALING IGNORANCE
TWO fatal automobile accidents have occurred it Arizona within a
month, cn near Yuma and the other a Christmas night tragedy
in which a wife and mother lost her life on the Bisbee-Douglas
highway, both caused by the blinding glare of undimmed auto
mobile headlights. The regrettable irony of those two accidents is
that in neither case was the owner of the death-dealing headlights
the victim.
The latest tragedy, a particularly sad one, should strike home to
every user of an automobile both in this city and in Douglas, who
has not equipped the headlights of his car with so-called "dimmers",
for it points to a risk run by every motorist on the Bisbee-Dougla3
highway. It should strike home with double force to those intelligent
motorists who properly dim their headlights, for it is they who run
the greater risk the risk of falling a victim of the other man's folly,
ignorance or negligence.
On Christmas night a happy family, husband, wife and children,
were motoring to their home in Douglas, with no thought of the grim
death rushing to meet them with no thought beyond the joyful
spirit of Christmas.
Then, according to the husband's story, an auto appeared from
the opposite direction, its glaring, undimmed headlights flashing
into his eyes and blinding him. The result: his car swerved from
the roadway and overturned, pinning his wife and himself beneath
it. Kis wife wes killed. He was seriously injured. The motorist
whose blinding headlights had cost a human life continued serenely
on his way, most probably, as the Associated Pres3 account of the
tragedy says, in complete ignorance ot wiiat had occurred.
Thus a happy Christmas party ended in that most tragic ot
death.; the double Io3s to children of a mother, and to a husband
of a wife. And the culprit, it seems, is to get off without even suf
fering the pangs of conscience which would follow knowledge of his
deed!
Arizona has plenty of motor laws. So has Cochise county. In
Bisbee a new ordinance for the regulation of motor traffic has just
been passed. But in state statute, county, or city, there is no law
compelling the proper dimming of automobile headlights.
Let anyone who is curious stand in black dancness on the side
walkless residential street through Tombstone Canyon any part or
this street from Castle Rock to the Tombstone end of the city limits
will do fur the purpose of darkness and count the number of auto
mobiles with blinding headlights which pass up and down the street
in the course of half an hour. He will come to the conclusion that
the Almighty must haVe set up a special guardianship over this dark,
winding thoroughfare, used alike by pedestrians and sight-bewildering
autoists, as the only possible explanation of why the auto head
lights do not garner in at' least from three to a half dozen victims a
night.
A motorist who is so ignorant, or so wilfully negligent and care
less of the lives of others that he will not of his own volition properly
equip his headlights in this regard, may not be expected to remedy
the dimserous omission when the facr. of the danger is pointed out
to him. What is needed is a law to compel the use of dimmers on
headlights, carrying teeth in a penalty provision of imprisonment
without the alternative of a fine. It would not, in fact, be going too
far to revise the state laws tc include in the category of manslaughter
the taking of a life by a motorist when it is proved that undimmed
headlights were the cause.
Blinding headlights have taken a toll of two lives in Arizona
within a month. It is high time for state, county and city officials
to get busy and lock the stable before any more horses are stolen.
HITTING THE NAIL ON THE HEAD
THE "anti-red" resolution passed by Bisbee Lodge No. 671, B. 1.
O. Elks, which is published elsewhere in this issue of the Re
view, hits the nail squarely on the head in regard to the I. V. W.
menace.
The resolution, besides breathing a spirit of that sincero and
whole-hearted Americanism wnich scorns equivocation and com
promise, is remarkble for the thoroughness and simplicity of the
treatment which it urges for any and all classes of disloyalists.
Deporting the disloyal aliens has been persistently urged from
a variety of sources, and already has been carried out to a certain
extent in the case of the most conspicuous examples of sedition, but
its administration has been f;r from complete.
But the resolution of the Bisbee Elks proposes, in brief: that
Congress pass immediately a law providing for the deportation ot
all alien members of the I. V. W. and other "red" organizations; for
the darstic punishment of all persons, particularly American citizens
of birth, who belong to or uphold the aoctrines of such organizations;
and that congress immediately appropriate sufficient funds to carry
out the provisions of such a law to the letter.
The simplicity and thoroughness of the remedy proposed by the
Elks is that it makes mere membership in the I. V". W. a crime, and
that it provides sufficient money to see that the crime is promptly
and properly punished. There can be no equivocating, beating about
the bush or legal jockeying about the matter.
The resolution is to bo sent to the governor of Arizona and this
state's representatives in both houses of congress. It will be en
dorsed warmly by the Arizona representatives at Washington, ot
course. But it is to be hoped that these gentlemen of congress suc
ceed in gettipg it past the endorsing stage.
IS DEATH A SLEEP?
!N the Willard Parker Hospital. New York, Mrs. Dora Mlntz has
wakened ifter sleeping three weeks. Nothing appeared to be
wrong with her. Blood tests showed no disease germs. Doctors
finally dlagonized her case as "lethargic encephalitis." which, they
say, is a general term and cannot be accurately defined.
During Mrs. Minlz's sleep the doctors permitted an interesting
experiment. M. Hoffman, violinist, had a theory that music could
restore her to consciousness. He played "Kol-Nidre," a Jewish
hymn, with which elio was familiar. She stirred, showed signs ot
waking, then sank again into stupor. Finally time to. naturally, as
if she had slept only overnight. -Is
death a similar sleep?
That the cells of the body live on after the body is dead, is sug
gested by an article in the Journal of Experimental Medicine. Dr.
Albert H. Kboling of the RockrMW Institute for Medical Research,
wrote it.
Ebeling toils of a piece of flesh cut from a chicken's 'heart Jan.
17, 1012. by Dr. Alexis Carrel. After seven years, it is ill alive.

Bi.sbee's fame is going to spread over the world like restaurant syrup

right.
A Mexican, who scorned to be searching for his equilibrium, when
joined by Officer SJicrrill, who had promised to help him find that force,
said ha was going to look for a flyi.ig white mule after he had found the
first object of his search. Incidentally, he lost his equipoise by the de
natured alcohol route.
But it's the flying white mule in which we are interested. Wings, beau
tiful wingr, champagne color, he claims. It was late Christmas night wheu
he first saw it, he tells us, soaring over Brewery Gulch. Soaring for hours
at a time with an occasional flap of the wings, but never coming below the
haze that ma: ked the glow from the lights. Green eyes, too. the Hying
white mule had for the super-animal looked down about the Mexican once
with tJiose eyes.
"Espiritu de inula blanca," heerk.d and says he called to passersby to
enjoy the remarkable sight but they laughed at him, gibed him and passed
by without even looking for the flying white mule and left him alone, sitting
on the curb, to drink in the beauty, grace and phenomenon of the animal
o.' the land gone to the sky.
But. the animal neighed, whined and bellowed as it flapped its wing.
iu protcs to Officer Sherrill's coming and flew noisily into darkness.
It was then the Mexican sought his level ad the power to maintain
that level and with tho suggestion of Sherrill walked to that whit? stone
building next door to the fire station. He slept here through the night with
dreams ot" corralmg that white mule, dreams cf saddling It and flying aw,
to conquer tha lost green monster.
But we're1 staving up lnte nights to sec that flying white mule. Have
you seen him? The flying white mule! Whai is ho? From where dees ht

Old Timers of Bisbee
VII George Dunn
Christianity Up to the Minute
(This is the sixth of a series of ar
ticles on the "old-timers' of Bisbee
and the Warren District, which are ap
pearing daily in the Review. The se
ries will conclue in next Tuesday's
issue with the story of John E. Lath
am, ("Brocky Jack") probably the old
est living Arizona stage driver, who
recently left Bisbee to return to 11 ia
native state of Tennessee. Ed.)
Among those pioneers who came
into Arizona when the territory was
little more than a name, and who,
drifting southward, saw Bisbee grow
from a handful of prospectors to one
of the great copper camps of the
world, George Dun, son of the dis
coverer of the district, should hold a
prominent place. Associated with his
father, Jack Dunn, in many of the ac
tivities of the latter, and having an
intimate knowledge of the mm and
things that preceded the founding of
lfisbee. he ha sa special knowledge of
the history of the Warren district, and
is a special link binding this age to
that of the Apache, the stage line
and the bad man.
George Dunn was born in New York
City in 18G5. At the age or 16 years
after having attended the public
schools of New York, he came to Fort
Bowie, v.hcer hi3 father was a scout in
the employ of the United States army.
He secured the mail contract here,
and for tv. o years drove the mail
stage. It was during this period that
the last stand of the Apaches was be
ing made, and Dunn haa many oppor
tunities of assisting the authorities in
running to earth the last of the "hos
tiles, 'as the Apaches were known
familiarly.
because of the fact that he held the
mail contract and was in close con
tact with governmental activities, he
had an opportunity in 18S6 of bring
ing Geronimo and his savages under
a whio flag a feat which would have
brought the activities of the Indians
to a close a full two years before the
actuad surrender of the famous chief,
had not Americans who were selling
liquor to the Indians frustrated the
plan.
The stcry, which is only one of a
score of tne same kinw that Dunn
can recount of the Indians, is as fol
lows :
One day he was driving his stage to
Fort Bowie, and had come within
three miles of the fort when he saw,
In rounding a bend of the road, three
Indians standing motionless in it.
Two had rifles and the third was
armed with bow and arrows. Dunn
reached for his revolver, but the In
dians raised thtlr hands in the air and
walked dowa tr the stage. They
spoke to Dunn in Apaches, which he
could not understand and then point
ed down the mountin towards the fort.
Dunn sensed that they wanted the pro
tection of the mail stage in getting
ino he for and so he drove on, the
Indians following. At the sutler's
store Dunn met his father, who was
well acquainted with the Apache
tongue, and who, after interrogating
the savages, brought them to head
quarters. Here it was ascertained that
the Indiaps were runners for Geroni
mo, who was about at the end of his
resources and who wished to surren
der. Preliminary arrangements for
his surrender were made immediately
and Qeronimo and his tribe came as
near to Fort Bowie as the John
Slaughter ranch. Here the savages
were sold whisky by two Americans,
and alter drinking heavily, the
Apaches arose in the night and stole
away.
For two years after this Dunn spent
his time with a government pack train
and was employed thus when the fa
mous chief surrendered in truth, came
in with his wives and people, and com
posed himself to the thought of going
into exile in Florida. Dunn was fold
that the trip was to begin and was
then requested to drive a two-seated
buckboard in which Geronimo was to
be carried to Bowie station. Dunn
was not experienced in handling four
horses or mules, but he was under
orders, and finally the vavalcade was
drawn up, with a carry-all or escort
wagen preceding the buckboard. In
the escodt wagon were Geronimo's
squaws, while the old chief and two
other Indians were in the rear seat of
the buckboard. During the confusion
preliminary to the start, Geronimo diB
uppeared. A quick investigation found
him in the escort wagon, huddled
among the squaws, whom he refused
to leave. His reason was his fear that
during the ride to Bowie station in the
buckboard some outraged settler
might shoot him from ambush in re
venog for the wrong done by him and
his people. From that time Dunn has
called Geronimo a coward.
Dunn worked for th egovernment
in various capacities until 18S9, when
he took up his permanent residence in
Bisbee. His father had returned to
Connecticut in 1885, where he had)
died. Although he had discovered the j
ore deposits of Bisbee, and had stak
ed George Warren to make locations
for him, the duplicity with which he
had been treated by his partners had
resulted in keeping him from any
great participation in the financial re
turns from the district. His son, how
ever, looked upon the matter philoso
phically, and even now refrains from
untoward criticism of those with
whom his father was associated. He
took up the life of a prospector, for
which his love of the great outdoors
fitted him, and sinec then has taken
care of his various claims in southern
Arizona, with Bisbe a3 his headquar
ters.
Dunn still cals himself a young man
and in health, strength and intellect
he is. He is perhaps the best known
of the Bisbee pioneers in the district
and numbers his friends by the hun
dreds. He retains a great respect and
live for his father, and, with the other
first-comers here who knew Jack
Dunn, remembers him as a man of the
highest integrity and courage. His
mother died in Bisbee in 1909. Mr.
Dunn is not married except to the
Huachuca mountains, which he consid
ers the fairest section of earth in "the
world.

ORIGIN OF THE CHRISTMAS
TREE
For several centuries after the birth
of Jesus Christ, Christmas, our hap
piest season, was to His followers one
of heroic ordeaL His birthday was j it points to the sky
the fall of the oak before the mighty
blows of the apostle. . the Story of
Jesus simply told and how -sin, not
human life, is the sacrifice He asks.
" 'And here. said the . apostle, as
his eyes fell on a young fir tret,
Standing straight and green with Its
top pointing toward the stars, amid
the divided ruins of the fallen oai,
here is .the living tree, with no stain
of blood upon it, that shall be the
sign of your new worship. See how
Let us call it
first celebrated in the second century,
it is said by order of Telesprorus, who
shortly after suffered martyrdom, the
observance of the anniversary of
Christ's nativity being one of his of
fenses. But though the initiator of the
observance diei the observance lived
lived through flame and sword.
After two hundred years, in the reign
of Diocletian we read of a vast multi
tude of Christians assembled, of
windows and doors barred by the
Pagan emperor's order of torches
applied to the crowded building, and
the burning alive of hundreds or
the tree of the Christ-child. Take
it up and carry it to the Chieftain's
hall, for this is the birth-night of the
White Christ: You shall go no more
into the shadows of the forest to
keep your feasts with secret rites oi
phame. You shall keep them at home
with laughter and song and rites of
love' "
Thus did "the hour ' of darkness,
the Dower of winted, of sacrifice, and
i mighty fear" vanish before the glad
radiance of redeeming love, and tne
Pagan oak, whose roots were fed
with blood, fall before the fir tree
which "points to the stars."

MANY NEW YEAR
PARTIES PLANNED. j
With Christmas day a more or less
substantial memory, the holiday sea
son still holds much enjoyment in
the antitcipation of festivities inci
dent to the welcoming of the New
Year. The unanimous verdict seems
to be that a finer Christmas has sel
dom been recorded and not often old
Santa's pack been so heavily laden
with gifts or the distribution been
more satisfactory. In . fact it seems
to be -a sort of an echo of Thanks
giving in many an instance where the
long coveted has come within the
grasp. In consideration of these
things, the forecast for the New Yeai
is unusually bright ushered in with
the hand of contentment and warm
with, rose colored tints.

GOOD BS TO
IFCOPPER BY
SH COMPANY
Before January 13 the Shea Copper
company will be shipping 25 tons ot
high-grade silver-copper-gold ore daily
to the United Verde Extension smal
ter. The prooceeds should more than
pay the cost of development on the
present scale.
Temporary ore bins att he foot of
the dump are almost finished and a
road is being built which will afford
easy access to the bins. Completion
of bins and road is all that is holding
up shipments now.
Extraordinarily good ore is coming
iro mthe raise that Is being made
from the 320-foot level to the inter
section of the easfc-and-west with he
norh-and-south vein. Every shot av
erages right around $250 a ton. The
main values are silver, of course, but
the ore carries eight per cent copper
jnd runs about $20 in gold to the ton.
Not enough work has been done to
determine just how much of this ore
there is. The raise has been all in
ore pracvtically all the way from the
320 and tlrere is no sign of a wall.
Today the raise is up about 100
feet from the 320k. Unless all geology
fails, the mineralization wil be much
heavier there.
A few days shoud carry the raise
to the intersection of the two ledges
as a round of holes is shot every day.
EL PASO FIELD
EL PASO, Dec. 27. Geeod news
wasught to many El Paso stockholders
in the El Paso Ranger Oil company
Monday by a telegram announcing the
extension of the Eastland field by
striking oi in the Greenwood and
Tyrrell well.
1 This well is two miles further from
j Eastland than the property of the
El Paso Ranger and the El Paso Ran
jiger land is in a direct line with the
j new well.
"With oil in the Greenwood and
Tyrrell well," said R, M. Dudley, field
manager for the El Paso Ranger com
pany, there is hardly a shadow of a
doubt but that there is oil beneath the
land of the El Paso Ranger company.
This latest strike virtually proyes our
properly."
A report in El Paso Tuesday was
to the effect tliat the Greenwood and
Tyrrell well was flowing 2500 to 3000
barrel's a day.

East Texas Fields
Attract Interest
CARTHAGE, Tex., Dec. 27. Oil op
erators are taking a new interest in
the Bethany oil fields in eastern
Texas. The Southwestern Oil and Gas
company is planning to run a plptuine
from Greenwood to the gas field near
Bethany to handle the gas production
of the Gulf Production company's big
wells in that section.
llhe Gulf Production company is
now redrilling its big gasser. This
well, known as the Augers No. 2 near
the Boggy church site, is jnst north
of the discovery well on the headright
tract. It was the first deep well to be
drilled below 2700 feet in this terri
tory. The Texas company is arranging to
drill an offset to this weel on the
south and the Gulf Production com
pany is buying up a large number of
acres around the well.

Quality Goes ClearThrough
I r::!
Continued improvement has been
shown in the copper market during
the bird week of December( says the
Boston Financial News, and some
large transactions have been recorded
with the quotations on this business
lSV&c per pound tor spot deliverq, 18
to 19c for first quarter next year and
a nominal range of from 19 to 19Mc
for the second three months of 1920.
Thp latter prices have been bid; but,
so far as can be learned, sellers have
J not shown a willingness to book ord
ers so far in advance.
This is believed to be due to a gen
eral view in the trade among the sell
ers that higher prices will, prevail at
the time deliveries would be made,
and as present indications are that the
metal will advance from the present
levels it is taken to be the best policy
to hold off accepting all the future
business that is available at the pres
ent time.
One of the features of the market,
which has attracted considerable at
tention, has been the attitude of some
of the smaller dealers. These inter
ests have either withdrawn from the
market or have put their quotations
above those of the leading selling
agencies. The few that are sfill in
the market are holding firmly for the
prices named by the large dealers.
This is especially significant when
it is recalled that ony a short time
ago these same small sellers were
shading the market and caused many
consumers to postpone buying in the
hope that prices would crumble. Ap
parently the suppl available at low
figures has been absorbed and the
technical position of the market has
been strengthened to this extent.
In addition to the good business
from domestic consumers there has
been considerable improvement in the
export demand. Since the beginning
of the month the Copper Export as
sociation has been receiving inquiries
on a lerger scale than in some time.
It is estimated in the trade that for
eign sales during the 15 days of De
oember have involved approximately
50,000,000 pounds. Of this total Japan
purchased almost one-half and the re
mainder was taken by England,
France and Germanw In the order
named.
Of course this amount is consider
ably under what would have been nor
mal shipments for a similar period in
a normal year before the war, but in
view of the many reports of the large
surplus of the metal carried in the
various countries, especially those in
volved in the past war, the buying is
attracting considei'abel attention. It
is mainained that if the various sories
abou the big surplus tbroad had been
accurate, European nations would not
be in the domestic market at the pres
ent time.
Consumers are known to be optimis
tic regarding the future of the market.
INT
HES
ARE
After a suspension of more than a
week of its mines and smelterB in
Montatna, thereby throwing out of
employment 12,000 employes, Anacon
da copper has resumed operations in
all departments, now that sufficient
supply of coal is assured. While it is
almost Impossible for any mining com
pany which has bene shut down to
start immediatey operations on the
same scale as existed before such a
suspension. Anaconda's closing was
of such a short duration that not
much trouble is anticipated in getting
back o its former normal capacity.
This closing, however, should be
reflected in the copper output for De
cember, when production figures are
published in the first week of next
month. In November, Anaconda re
ported production of 14,120,000 pounds,
and it is almost sabfe to assume htta
December's total should not be much
higher than 10,000,000 pounds, unless
the management should take meas
ures to increase output during the re-
maining days of this month.
Because of the decreased production
I which has been going on for some
time, and the' rather dark outlook
which the mining companies were fac
' ing, couplied with a limited demand
(for the matal, reports eminatlng from
i certain quarters were to the effect
that proppects of a reduction in the
$4 tier annum rate were probable.

Permit Requested
for Drilling Close
to the Royal Duke
EASTLAND, Tex., Dec. 27. An ap
plication has bene made by the Prairie
Oil and Gas company to the railroad
commission for a permit to drill a
well within 65 feet of the Hanks No
1 of the Royal Duke Oil company in
the Pleasant Grove (Uistrict of the
Ranger-Eastand oil field.
, Thos is the first case of this nature
to come up lor discussion and settle
ment since the rule 27 went into ef
fect on November 26, The rule is
"No well shall be commenced nearer
than 300 feet to any other drilling or
producing well or nearer than 150 feet
to any property line." An agreement
will be reached within the next sev
eral days.
The Prairie Oil and Gas company
holds a lease on 88 acres of the Hanks
tract and the Royal Duke company
holds a lease on 8 6 acres forming an
"L" along the north and the west
boundaries of the Prairie Oil and Gas
company's lease. The company desires
to drill an offset to the HankB No. 1
which is flowing 1800 barrels of oil
daily.
If it is decided that the drilling of
this well will in no way injure the
adjoining lease it is possible that the
permit will be granted.

To drive a car, providing it's a reliable and reasonable
priced ' car such as the Dort, is plain COMMON
SENSE, and in accord with the spirit of the times.
To be without the time saving and health-preserving
benefits such as a car affords, lessens activity and lim
its usefulness.
Dort buyers who in the past years have paid much
more than the Dort price are enjoying full satisfaction
in Dort ownership.
Not alone because Dort up-keep and operating ex
pense is comparatively trivial, but because in looks,
power, strength, simplicity and stability the car meets
requirements.
You will like your Dort for its eagerness to do
things your way for its power, flexibility, simplicity.

couldn't wish themselves big, for then they would have been
'p heavy for the leaf to carry.
"What shall we do?" they cried, when all at once they
heard a buzzing over their; heads and a beautiful purple
dragon-fly lighted beside them.
- "Just hop on my back and I'll carry you safely to, shore,"
.e said, which he did, and-the" children couldn't ,-thank him
enough. I

Tips of the Town
i ... i w
RED RADIGALS
The following resolution, denounc
ing the I. V. W. and kindred radical
organizations', ."and urging their
prompt national suppression, was
adopted at the last meeting of the Biis
bee Lodg of Elks:
He It Resolved by Bisbee Lodge ot
Xo. 671, of the Benevolent and Pro
tective Order of Elks:
That we view with deep concern the
spread of disloyalty and of seditious
sentiment promulgated by syndical
ists, 1. V. W.'s and the Bolshevik!.
We believe that the time has ar
vived when Americans should assert
themselves and drive from these
shores all disloyal aliens, and ade
quately punish those who betray
their country by disloyal acts. We
hereby call upon the United States
congress to immediately enact a law
providing for the summary deporta
tion of every alien in this country who
is a member of the 1. W. W. or any
other organization of like teachings
and tendencies;
That the law should further provide
for the immediate cancellation of the
citizenship papeis of any naturalized
citizen who shall affiliate with any
such organization; and, for drastic
punishment of all persons, especially
American citizens by birth, who be
long t or uphold the doctrines of
such organizations.
We believe that no person should
be permitted to issue or to circulate
any writing or pamphlet which has
for its apparent object the undermin
ing of American institutions or the in
citing of rebellion.
We further demand that congress
forthwith appropriate sufficient
money to carry forward properly and
pomptly the deportation of undesir
able aliens. Be it further
Resol.ed, that we believe mat ade
quate laws should be enacted to sup
press the activities of any persons,
citizens or aliens, who by any means
may be endeavoring to create ill-feeling
between the United States of
America and any friendly nation.
It is further ordered that a copy of
these resolutions be rorwarded to
Governor Thomas E. Campbell, and to
the senators and representatives from
this state in congress.

Exalted Ruler.
