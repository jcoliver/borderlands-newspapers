FRANCE, Aug. 9, (By the Associated
Press.) The British and French divi
sions have gained more ground in the
great battle raging in the Amiens
Somme district. The latest reports ap
pear to show that the Germans are re
tiring in great haste.
The scenes on the battle ground
over which the allies already have
passed give evidence of this haste in
abandoned guns, stores, and even regi
mental and artillery maps and papers.
Aerial observers report larg?
streams of transports and men hurry
ing eastward in full retreat.
Beaucourt fell to the allied forces
this morning and Le Quesnel also was j
taken after hot all-night fighting. i
The cavalry is working far back to-1
ward the Somme and is still roundin? j
tip villages, while tanks and crmoreu j
cars are running over the country j
clearing a way for the troops cj- killing
iiorses drawing enemy supplies. Thd
drivers of motor trucks and lorries are '
chasing parties of Germans here and ,
there, scattering them or running I
them to earth.
One of these armored cars ran into :
a town yesterday while a German
corps was having lunch. It turned
its guns through the corps' quarter
windows, killed some of the staff andlon,.twf imPrtal" sectors on the Lys
then chased others who escaped from '
the house. At Hosier another rr i
set an enemy train on fire
A group of cars met, far inside the !
enemy lines, a German supply column
and halted it. Four mounted German
officers came up to see what the trou
ble was and were shot from the cars
which then proceeded to make quick
work of the column.
At Framerville the cars engaged a
train loaded with the enemy and final
ly set it afire. Tanks entered this
town soon afterwards, helped the arm
ored cars clean it up and then hoisted j
flags on the roof of the building w hich
had been German corps headquarters. !
One car met a high German officer I
riding in an automobile along the road
The officer was killed and his macu:ne !
captured.
All along the line this afternoon
snipers and isolated machine gun bul
lets were extremely busy, but these
were being silenced one by one as the
advance proceeded.
It is reported that two regimental
commanders have been captured in
one sector.
Since daybreak the Germans have
been making an extraordinary effort
to blow up with field gun fire ammuni
tion and other dumps which they had
to leave so hastily yesterday.
Their aim was exceedingly poor.
The scene at Bayonvillers today is
typical of the rest of the battle area.
Broad fields of crops or brown grass
fringe the town and spread for mile3
over the flat surrounding country.
Abandoned German field guns are here
with little piles of empty shell cases
and the bodies of Germans are lying
here and there, telling the story of
what happened. Lying off on the side

Over a curving front of more than

As on the first day of the of

en miles was evacuated by the enemy
while to the north of Kemmel the Bri
tish advanced their line over a front
exceeding 1000 yards.
These maneuvers seemingly in
dicate the Germans either con
sidered their ground insecure or
that Crown Prince Rupprecht's
army has been materially de
creased in strength to rush rein
forcements to the battle zones
where the German armies in the
south are being sorely barrassed.
After the British had penetrated the
Picardy salient to a depth of nearly
thirteen miles in the center toward
the important railroad of Chaulnes,
the northern and southern flanks of
the battle front gave way before the
pressure respectively of the British
and French.
On the north the British captured
Morlancourt and pressed on eastward,
while on the south, northwest of
Montdidier, Pierrepont, Contoire and
Arvlllers were taken by the French,

of more than eight and a half miles. '

CHICAGO,' Aug. 9 William D.
Haywood, characterized by gov
ernment counsel as the "swivel

set America's military program,
stoutly denied on the witness
stand late today that lie had ever
advocated violence and reasserted
his views that essenf'al social re
forms must be brought about by
Industrial rather than political
methods.
The general secretary-treasurer of
the Industrial Workers of the World
struck a comparison between th
wage slave of today and the chattel
slave of the period before the Civil
war."
'The black man of the south before
the war was better off," he asserted.
This slave had but one master who
owned his body. But this master fed
him well. He was1 well boused and

Haywood reviewed the stormy career
of the I. W. W. from Its organization
in 1905 by members of the western
federation of miners, the American
labor union, the Social Trade and La
bor Alliance and similar organizations
up to the industrial strife of 1909. He
reaffirmed his belief in the I. W. W.
preamble to the declaration of prin

termed the small political power of

said. Then he pointed to the long

NEW RULES OF
CLASSIFYING
Secretary Baker Not Satisfied
With Present System and
Intimates Another May
Come Soon
(By Review Leased Wire)
WASHINGTON, Aug. 9. New draft
regulations under which the govern
ment would do the selecting rather
than leaving it to the registrant, are
under consideration by the war de
partment. This was disclosed today
by Secretary Baker after he had ap
peared before the senate committee to
urge prompt enactment of the new se
lective service act extending the age
limits to include all men between the
ages of 18 and 45.
The war secretary made it plain that
he is not satisfied with the present
system which the registrant must
claim deferred classification, as many
men with dependents hesitate for pa
triotic reasons to make such a claim.
In this connection Mr. Baker said he
was inclined to the opinion that the
marriage relation will in itself consti
tute deferred classification.
What Mr .Baker has in mind is to
lay down a set of questions which the
registrants would answer and then
have rules which would take care of
the classification. He is understood to
regard this as the fair and equitable
system.
The discussion on the draft ages be
fore the senate committee. Mr. Baker
said followed much the lines taken by
General March, chief of staff, and Pro
vost .Marshal General Crowder. The
committee, he added, did not indicate
any disposition to question the neces
sity for the change.
"There was some discussion," Mr.
Baker said, "as to whether it was the
intention of the department to extend
the work or fight order to include
classes of persons in various profes
sional occupations. I told them there
was no present change of the work or
fight order in contemplation. I said
that when I decided the baseball case
I thought perhaps other forms of
amusement and entertainment mlnht
require an extension of the order to be
on a parityith the baseball situation,
but that, was not in their mind.
"They had heard from outside
sources that the department was con
sidering bringing professional classes,
like lawyers, newspapermen and per
sons who were not actually engaged in
producing war supplies under the or
der." "The committee," Mr. Baker con
tinued, "was especially interested in
the effect of the extension of the draft

WASHINGTON, Aug. S.Tbe
startling rapidity of the British-,
French advance in Picardy, coup
led with new success in Flanders
and on the Vesle, produce 1 an im-'
prosicn among some army offi
cers that a decisive-moment, per
haps the final battle, was apr
proaching.
The German hlh command seemed
to stand fa:e to face with a vital de
cision. Either his reserve must be
rushed in and pitched battle risked,
or all he has gained at staggering cost
abandoned and a withdrawal beeun
without delay.
While no American troops are
known to be involved In the PicarJy
thrust, the capture of Fismette. the
suburb across the river from Flames,
on the Vtsle,' apparently is a part o"
the great general scheme of attack.
Coupled with developments in Pic-
many officers that Marshal Foch is
evidently challenging the enemy to
fieht It out now or to withdraw.
The French and British have gone
ahead with such rapidity in Picardv
that the German retreat must have
reached the proportions of a route n
places. The whole bottom of the great
Picardy salient has been flattened out
in two days. If he is forced to with
draw the last menace to Paris will be
removed. '
The sudden stroke on the Lys line
in Flanders which General Haig coup
led with the Picardy drive today, ap
pears to make it clear that the enemv
is rushing support from the north to
block the holes In his line torn by
the British-French thrust. The Flan
ders front was founj to be lightly held
and good results were obtained.
The failure of the German drive on
both sides of Rheims and the defeat of
the armies of the German crown
prince drew heavily on the reserves in
the north. It is regarded as certain
now that the mass of Prince Rup
precht's reserves must be rushed to
the Picardy salient, even If the Flan
ders bulse is surrendered.
It- appears the impending German
Irive in Flanders has been completely
checkmated before it started. The en

has been placed in jeopardy and he

AMERICANS REPEL THREE FIERCE GERMAN
ASSAULTS AND TAKE NORTHERN SUBURB OF
FISMES IN RETALIATION AGAINST HUN RAIDS
WITH THE AMERICAN ARMY OX THE VESLE FRONT. Aug. 9 (By
The Associated Press, 7:30 p. m.). Three vicious but ineffectual thrusts
were made last night and today by the Germans against the line 'west of
Rheims. The net result was a smart repulse by the French, against whom
the most determined attack was made, and the inclusion of the northern
suberb of Fismes in the American line In addition to about a hundred
prisoners.
Throughout the night and day the operations In the Soissons-Rhelms
sector were characterized mostly by artillery fire, in which the Germans
shifted their long range guns from time to time to reach villages and
roads which' they themselves traversed a week ago. Cloudiness continued
to interefere with aerial activities although both sides were busier than
during the past few days.
-The Americans rushed over the river, leaping, running and crawling
icross the debris cf a heavy bridge which was blown up by the Germans,
its piers and other timbers so falling, however, as to make the ruins
available. '
In the village a rather weak resistance was encountered. The German
force, which .had been left there had been unable to retreat' to their own
lines because of the heavy artillery fire and when brought Into the Amer
ican lines the majority were wounded.
A great many of the defending force were killed.
A German lieutenant led a party of less than thirty men in a thrust
igainst w hat probably appeared to be a weak point. A machine gun sec
ion caught the party under its fire and annihilated It.
The only general action today was when the French and Americans
aid down a box barr?ge and carried out a reconnaissance. There was
some belief that the Germans had withdrawn from a large part of this
position "and it was desired to learn if the enemy was still there.

AMERICAN SHIP
(By Review Leased Wire)
NEW YORK, Aug. 9. Behind th
arrest by federal officials today ol
six officers of the sieamship Y'adklu,
a former North German Lloyd linef
,tak-n over by the United SU'.?s ship
ping beard lies the tory of a strange
"joy ride" -shich the vessel Is said to
have taken through the Mediterranean
after having recently landed a cargo
of supplies for the allied armies.
On this cruise, which constituted a
"side trip" on the return voyage the
officers are said to have made merry,
stoping at various ports and Rellln
the ship's valuable stores In order to
supply themselves with wine and
spare cash. On arriving in this coun
try several days overdue, their alibi
is alleged to have been that subma
rines had driven them from their
course.
This "explanation," however, Is said
to have been discredited when the
officers cf a Spanish ship to whom an
offer had been made at sea to sell the
Yadkin's coal became suspicious and
reported the matter on ttieir arrival
to the United States shipping board.
When the Yadkin eventually reached
this country the ship's stores, valued
at thousands of dollars, were practic
aly exhausted, it is charged.
Details of the Mediterranean cruise
are furnished In a confession said to
have been obtained by Henry Ward
Beers, assistant United States district
attorney, from Edwin M. Reddy of
Tompkinsvllle, chief officer of the Y'ad
kin. On the Mediteranean rvoyage the
Y'adkin Is said to have stopped at
Genoa, Gibraltar and other ports. At
one port, it Is charged, 3100 tons of
coal were sold for only $1225.

"The Marne defeat," says a Berne news-pi-er,
"has produced unspeakable scenes
of dispair in Berlin. Such outbreaks of
utter discouragement and downhearted
ness never before were witnessed."
Contrast this with the heroism and the
inflexible purpose of the people of Paris
who have been bombed from the clouds
and bombarded by the long range gun and
heard the roar of the enemy artillery as it
destroyed the fairest provinces of France,
all this for four terrible years. Consider
their courage, their serenity, their sublime
patience and faith in the face of three great
defeats this year. What an illuminating in
sight into the character of these two
peoples !
INDUSTRIAL AND FINANCIAL
TOTALS THAT ARE ASTOUNDING
A New York financial authority makes
the following statement of the present in
dustrial and financial side of the war:
Tremendous activity exists in every line
cf industry connected with the war, prov
ing the energy and determination in which
this country is conducting the struggle.
Steel of course leadi in importance, because
it is the most-essential material in war..
The government is steadily expanding its
quota of the output; and only a small per
centage is granted for other purposes. The
largest tonnage at present is for shp steel,
but the orders for all war materials are upon
a growing scale. The Steel Corporation's
earnings for the last quarter were simply
phenomenal, amounting to $153,000,000,
of which over $90,000000 will go to the
government in taxes. Steel wages have
again been increased, and are now double
what they were in 1915. Textile industries
are correspondingly busy, and though not
making such extraordinary profits are still
enjoying much prosperity. For all raw
materials there is an excellent demand ; and
while scarcity is often les3 pronounced than
during the early stage of the war, prices
are maintained at high record. Wages are
generally advancing; costs of production
rise in consequence; then the demand for
still more wages is repeated, and so the
seiious practice runs on. Apparently noth
ing can stop this rising tendency of prices
except exhausted buying ipower and imper
ative economy. The latter is already ap
pearing, sometimes as a patriotic neces
sity, but chiefly because in many families
buying power i3 on the decline, luxuries are
entirely omitted, and in many instances the
consumption of essentials i3 materially cur
tailed. Economy, however, is not popular
either with those enjoying war profits or
war wages ; and war industries will certain
ly be active for months to come. It should
be remembered that the bulk of the $24,
000,000,000 which this government ex
pects to raise by loans and taxation during
the present fiscal year will be almost en
tirely spent in this country. Trie tide of
war inflation is still running strong, in spite
of mere frequent reactions.
The Ways and Means committee at
Washington i3 actively at work drafting a
new tax bill. Almost daily statements as
to what is proposed are given out for the
evident puipose of inviting criticism and
testing ' public opinion. Not less than
$8,000,000,000 of revenue is claimed to be
wanted for the fiscal year. It is hoped to
raise about $3,000,000,000 of this sum
from excess profits taxes; but that source
of revenue has already been largely util
ized. Hence many new taxes' seem likely
to be applied and others heavily increaied;
but the schedules are far from decided upon
and discussion will probably scale down
some of the most radical proposals; so that
ihere is good reason to hope for a simpler
and morc ra'ional bill than the one existing

pared to accept a radical increase in taxes,
to meet which widespread public economy
will be imperative. Congress will doubt
less seek to avoid financial suicide by over
burdening productive industry. Thus far
the war has cost Grefet Britain $40,000,
000,000 in four years, and the United
States since entry about $13,000,000,000,
of which $6,500,000,000 were loans to our
allies. We are now spending money at a
higher rate than any other country, our ex
penses being figured at $50,000,000 per
day, and those of Great Britain at over
$35,000,000 per day. It ij now announced
that another loan will be issued about the
middle cf October, the campaign to com
mence in the last week of September, the
amount named being $6,000,000,000.
AT LAST!
From Amsterdam comes the following,
credited to the Berlin correspondent of the
Cologne Volks Zeitung: "American troops
who have been employed in battle have
shown themselves to be thoroughly 'good
fighters." After being told for a year that
the Americans could not get over to France
in force and then being told for the pajt
three months that they couldn't fight after
they got there, the German people at last
are getting a word here and there of th
real truth of the American effort in this
war, which i3 the real, menacing and ever
increasing peril that hangs over the German
empire today.
La Liberte,' a Parisian newspaper, said
yesterday that Field Marshal Foch appeared
to be twenty years younger and positively
radiant, so pleased was he with the suc
cess of his strategy, which was resulting net
alone in the winning of battles but in the
relief from pressure of parts of the allied
line least able to withstand it. Foch's
mental attitude is not to be wondered at.
Shortly after the March offensive of the
Germans, the great French strategist was
made supreme commander of the allied
armies. It became his task to coordinate
the millions of men and the vast stores of
war' material held by the members of the
entente, so that they might best be utilized
against the Hun. In the meantime he had
the task of stopping the German onrushes,
wearing down the offensive power of the
central powers and at the same time sav-.
ing his own forces from loss as much as
possible. How well Marshal Foch has suc
ceeded in his task the whole world knows.
The Press, instead of chronicling steady
lossea in territory, men and material, each
day brings news of victory and encourage
ment to us and to our allies. Germany's
vaunted chock troop3 have been met and
defeated not only by the seasoned veterans
of France and Great Britain, but by the
Yankees, whose prowess Berlin affected to
despise, only a few months ago. No won
der Marshal Foch is happy.. Is not the
greater part of the civilized world coupling
the names of Foch and Freedom ? He has
performed a feat which establishes his place
in history as one of the greatest of strate
gists cfall times, a military man whose en
ergies have bent themselves to the side of
right and justice, liberty, freedom and
quality for all mankind.
Bending over the cots of the wounded
American soldiers in the field hospitals be
hind the lines,- the attendants heard cons
tantly repeated, this one refrain: "We can
lick 'em ; those Dutch are no fighters when
you get up to 'em; man for man and gun
for gun we can beat 'em every day." In
delirium and pain; in anguish, speaking
with twisted lips; slightly wounded and
speaking with a grim smile, the doughboys,
over and over again, kept saying, "We can
lick 'em." , The ruling passion, strong in
deiath and strong in life, possessed them.
They had met the Prussian in full force,
hand to hand, at odds and evens, up hill
and down, in wood and on open plain, and
had fought him to a standstill and finally
drove him back, had these new and untried
troops from the states and the fact obessed
them. The thought of it predominated all
fear and pain and fatigue. It was their
glory song after the fight was done. A
wonderful song. It thrills from French
battle plains to every city spire and country
lane in America.
Trotsky, the little rat faced bolshevik
minister of war, is reported to have issued
an edict declaring France and England his
enemies. Our allies can well be proud of
their enemies. Trotsky, however, is late
with his edict. He has bren an enemy of
the allies ever since he entered the knucr's
service nearly a yaer ago. But he has been
a greater r.emy of Russia than ever he was
of the allies.

staff could not save.
The guns abandoned here are in
shallow pits three feet deep. Little
holes nearby, covered with curved irn
slabs, show where the German gun
ners lived before they were killed or
ran to save themselves.
Harbonnieres nearby was shelled to
pieces. Debris lies all over the streets.
Hera the allied forces found the house
which the German mayor had oc
cupied. The whele top had been knock
ed off and several' shells had hit the
walls, but there were evidences that
he had stayed until the last moment.
Further southward the ground here
and there had been ploughed by the
shells and the bodies of men . and
horses were lying where they fell.
In many open places the ground
was literally dotted with German
corpses.
The allied casualties were extreme
ly light. For instance, one ba'ialion
in the thickest of the fighting had
only six men killed and four officers
and sixty men wounded during an
advance of eleven miles. These men
were tired when they finished the tas:i
before- them, but today they pushed
forward again.
In the north It appeared, that the
stoutest resistance developed, the Ger
mans firing a great number of shells,
especially across the Somme in the
region of Chipilly. However, War
fusee;Abancourt, Bayonvillers and
Harboniere3 are in the control of the
British.
The German trenches throughout
the whole length of the front were ex
tremely narrow, and poorly construct
ed. This was not caused by :acu oi
material, a! kinds of which are being
discovered and used. Aside from the
loss of ground and men this is most
serious to the enemy.
The allied aircraft today ' heav::
bombed the German rear and carried
out a great number of other flights,
observing the enemy's movements,
and keeping his machine within the
German lines. -This forenoon the ab
sence cf German planes was especially
marked.
The British and French guns ham
mered away at the enemy all day, mov
ing fQrward whenever required. But

"I told the committee." said the war

low the president to defer in class

have always considered that 19 was
the probable minimum and I have
come to the 18 minimum only because
it seems necessary to get the men.
"Not that I think men of IS are
necessarily too young. I think that
history shows that boys from 18 to 19
are immensely valuable, but I think
there is a sentiment in the country
which will look with very much more
anxious regard on the boys from 18 to

Mining and Financial News
BY REVIEW
NEW YORK, Aug.9. Gratifying war
news and prospects of a nearly amic
able adjustment of the dispute be
tween the railroads and federal auth
orities gave an upward impetus to
stocks today.
Active rails scored extreme gains of
1 to 2 points, that range also apply
ing to industrials and specialties.
United States steel pointed the way
throughout, its extr?me advance of 14
points to 111, the highest price in
several weeks, and retaining a'l but a
small fraction.
Baldwin locomotive advanced 2 c,n
the strength of reported divided action
in prospect.
Other firm to strong features in
cluded marine preferred, . American
locomotive, railway steel springs. New
York Air Brake, Great Northern, Mex
ican Petroleum and tobaccos. Sales
amounted to 320,000 shares. '
Exchange was firmer all around.
Sterling and Francs higher and like
wise rates to neutral centers, Spain ex
cepted. Liberty ZM's sold at a slight pre
minimum, touching 1100.02. Foreign
flotations also stiffened fractionally.
Total sales, par value, aggregated $7,
450.000. United States bonds, old is
sues, unchanged on call.
GRAIN
CHICAGO, Aug. 9. Corn eased
clown in price today! owing largely to
improved weather and to the gratify
ing character of the war news. The
close was unsettled, c to lc net
lower, with September $1.61 to
$1,613 and October, $1 .63 to $1.63.
Oats finished to down, and pro
visions off 17c to 50c.
Aggressive selling was emphasized
somewhat by bearish influences re
garding the government report, but cs
a rule the report was looked on as
hivino hwn Hiarnuntpd in advance.
The smallness of the receipts led to
a little demand at one time, dui was
more than offset later by bulletins tell
ing of the great success of the latest
drive against the Germans. Partial re
coveries that took place ofter midday
had no better basis apparently than an
effort by shorts to secure profits.
Oats ranged lower with corn. Liberal
arrivals of oats added to the selling
pressure.
Weakness of provisions was attribut
ed in some degree to the federal
trade commission's report advising
control of the packing industry. Talk
was current also that cool weather
would cause the hog movement to in
crease. NEW YORK COTTON MARKET

To Our Subscribers
Cj Owing to increased cost of labor, materials, and everything con
nected with the newspaper business The Review has found it neces
sary to discontinue the practice of having the routs carriers collect
subscription accounts. .
CJ This practice was unsatisfactory and inefficient as mistakes were
frequent and the results of this system were unsatisfactory both to the
subscriber and the paper.
( Therefore: We request that all subscription accounts be paid direct
to the business office of The Review. This will eliminate a large
source of error and we are sure the benefit derived from this course
will be mutual.
I Subscriptions not paid in a reasonable length of time will be dis
continued. Cf We will appreciate your cooperation in our efforts to give you the
very best possible cervice and conserve at the same time.

AT LEAST 25,000 RELATIVE TO
DRAFT HAVE BEEN HANDLED
BY BOARD MEMBERS AND THIS
COUNTY HAS BEST RECORD IN
STATE FOR EFFICIENT WORK
(Special to The Review;
TOMBSTONE, Ariz., Aug. 9 Ap
proximately 1775 Cochise county
young men are serving Uncle Sam in
war work of some kind, according to
figures made public by Ray B. Krebs,
secretary cf the local board today. Of '
this number about 200 are serving in
a non-commissioned capacity, while
the remaining 1575 are in military
service.
Of the above number 1117 are mem
bers of the dralt. The others are
volunteer service men, a majority o?
whom are serving in the navy.
The total registration for this
county is now 7057. Of this number
230 were registered June 5 cf this
year.
These men were classified as fol
lows: Class 1, 1S96; Class 2, 170;
Clas3 3, 123; Class 4, 1317, and Class
5, 3306. Class 5 is composed of men
physically unfit for service and men
already in military service.
Cochise county's first contingent
left for camp September 4, 1917. The
party consisted of thirty-four picked
men, a number of which are commis
sioned officers. The second party left
September 19, 1S17, and consisted of
250 men. A like number left on Octo
ber 3. The first quota of colored regis-
tranta lfft Rishee Novf niher 15 From I
November 15 to date there has been;''n Street, at 7
very few days that men have not been
entrained by the local board.
That the local board, consisting o
Dr. C. H. Hunt, chairman; Ray Krbes,
secretary, and H. L. Hutchison, chief
clerk, has been one of the busiest
organizations in the county since its
organization is evidenced by the num
ber of Interviews had. W hile no of
ficial record has been maintained it is
estimated that fully 25.0u0 inquiries
relative to the drait regulations have
been made of this board.
In addition to the work of examin
ing local drafted men. the board has ,
aiso carrieu mis woik among approx
imately 3000 others, transferred ano
referred here fr:ni other counties and
states.
At a recent meetinz of the lr.r- 1
and district boards held at the Santa
Rita hotel, in Tucson one of the of- :
ficials stated that Cochise countv ha 1 I
the best records in the state. He also
stated that while Cochise countv did
not have a very high percentage of
class one men. that thev had furnished !
their full quota and that when the
time came for more men he believed
they would be ready a3 needed.
