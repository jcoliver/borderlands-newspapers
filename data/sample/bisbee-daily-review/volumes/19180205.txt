H EAST VERY
CRITICAL IS
THE 0P1HI0N.TUEL OIL NOW
Fuel Administrators of States;
Tell Dr. Garfield That Cer-j
tain Points Have Only a
Day to Day Supply.
Bj- Review Leased Wire)
WASHINGTON. Feb. 4. A critical
coal situation throughout the east was
pictured to Fuel Administrator Gar
Ceid today by a half doxen fuel ad
ministrators called to Washington for
a conference.
So serious is the shortage in some
states that a number of administra
tors urged that there be no suspen
sion of the Monday closing order until
conditions are better. In these states,
it was declared, the people are only
a day ahead with their coal supply.
The administra'or for New York
city said apartment bouses and tene
ments had exhausted their supplies
and that coal was not available to fill
the demand. New Hampshire with a
three-day supply had the most favor
able report to make of all the states
represented. Pennsylvania. Maryland.
Delaware and Michigan repotted they
were dependent on day to day ship
ments. Suspension Discussed
Suspensions of the Monday closings
will be discussed tomorrow at a con
ference between Dr. Garfield and Di
rector General McAdoo. Tonight fuel
administration official appeared in
clined . to doubt that the order would
be lifted.
Because of another cold wave over
the east, accompanied by high wind
which drifted snow badly, the rail
roads today failed to establish the
coal hauling record for which officials
had hoped. By largely disregarding
general freight on the lines, however,
the quantity of coal delivered was re
ported a little higher than on pre
ceding d2ys.
On the Other Hand
Railroad administration officials
continue to insist that the interfer
ence with normal loading and unload
ing activities by the Monday closing
at freight teimiua'.s did more to dis
rupt the smooth working of the car
riers than the susper.iion of business
contributed to help. At the urgent
bugge-ion of the la'iroad administra
tion, mary shippers today kept their
earns and trucks a; work in railroad
yards li teiiicve the sst quantities of
freight which are glutting the termi
anls. Reports from A. H. Smith, regional
director for the east, on car move
ments today indicated a change in the
tide from a preponderance of east
bound traffic to a greater Dow west

WASHINGTON. Feb. 4- Govern

to oil in a proclamation by President
Wilson tonight putting under license
the manufacture and distribution . o
11 fuel oils. No mention is made of
other oils or oil products, including
gasoline and kerosene, but they. too.
probably will be put under control
soon.
Authority under the proclamation is
to be vested in Mark L. Requa of
California, recently named as chief of
the fuel administration oil division.
Licenses must be obtained before
February 11 by all manufacturers and
distributors whose gross sales of fuel,
including gas oil. amount to more thsn
100.000 barrels a yean-
A series of regulations drawn by the
fuel administration establishes in the

they are given regardless of contracts
outstanding.
Action Necessary
Difficulties of transportation, it is
declared in the president's proclama
tion and a statement prepared by the
fuel administration, making licensing
necessary that essential industries be
supplied. Operation of the control will
cut the supplies of the less essential
industries where lack 'of transporta
tion creates a shortage. The prefer
ential list is set forth as follus:
Railroads and bunker fuel.
Export deliveries or shipmnets for
the army or the navy.
Export shipments for the navies and
other war purposes of the allies.
Hospitals where oil is now being
used for fuel.

SECOND DAY OF
Mayor Calls Conference But j
No Headway Is Made In! I
Settlement. Violence Con

(Br Revter l-ased Wire)
ST. LOUIS. Feb. 4 The second day
of the street car strike here was
marked by increasing violence, nu
merous riot calls and aimost com
plete paralysis of traction transporta
tion. Efforts also were made to bring
about a settlement. No cars wer
operated tonight.
Mayor Kiel, acting on advice of the
city counsellor, who assured him that
he had authority to intervene, sent
formal summonses to the United Rail
ways company and to the officials of
the local union of the Amalgamated
Association or Street and Electric
Railway Employees to send represen
tatives to his office this evening.
Mayor KipI. before the conference,
said he would suggest an immediate
resumption of car service and that
the question of wages and hours be
left to a later adjustment. The labor
union obeyed the summons.
Official Decline Invitation
The plan or the mayor to bring the
two sides together in conference was
frustrated by the refusal of the Tint
ed railway officials to participate in
the conference. Instead. President
McCulIoch of the street car company
sent a letter to the mayor saying that
the dirtors of the company would
meet tomorrow and decide on a course
of action. He could say in advance,
however, according to the letter, that
the directors would be willing to sub
mit to he state public service com
mission whether they could or should
increase the wages of motormen and
conductors.
Not more than SO cars were oper
ated at any one time today, though
normally more than 1100 are operated
during the Monday rush hours. Thou
sands walked to and from work, other
thousands failed to report at facto
ries and stores, and hundreds of serv
ice automobiles and auto trucks did a
rushing business.
The rioting, which began soon after
the company started its cars, increas
ed in intensity as the day wore on
In the main the rioters contented
themselves with damaging cars.

for the deferred payments the board
decided to put the question before
the county attorney for advice. The
board will meet next Monday and

PARIS, Fob. 4. "I am no ua.lor.
I have asked to be judged, and I am
milling to die; but not as a traitor."
Thus spoke Bolo Pasha, who was
brought to trial by court martial to
day on a charge of treason in having
been a chief factor in German propa
ganda in France. Bolo's quick wit
and repartee mere features of the
silting, as he tried to extricate him
self from the conslusions of the re
port of aptain Bouhardon of the Pa
ris military court, who took the preli
minary testimony, and asked for ex
planations by Colonel Yoyer. the pres
ident of the courtmartial.
Otherwise than for the nervous
fumbling of his monocle. Bolo was
impassiveluring the reading of Cap
tain Bouchardon'a report of the in
vestigation, dealing with Bolo's activ
ities in Switzerland and affairs al
lied to have been carried out ia. the
I'nited States. The report dealt ex

Adolpb Pavenstedt. who formerly wss
connected with a Xew York bmking
house, but now is in Georgia intern

Bolo's counsel was that Bolo's activi
ties had been wholly in the interest
of the entente, powers.
Caillau Is Witness.
When former Premier CaiKanx was
callej. a witness for the defense. Bolo
said he would waive CaiUaux's testi
mony, but Darius Pochere. a co-de-dendant.
objected to this, declaring
that Caillaux's testimony must be
heard, if net in the present case. Uien
on behalf of himself.
During the reading of Cap'.ain Bou
chardon's seport. Bolo appeared some
what bored, but when called upon by
the president of t!'.e court martial to
explain discrepencies in his previous
testimony, the pjpsocer soon became
voluble. He spoke with a patronis
ing air to the prosecuting attorney and
the president of the court and admit
ted many discrepencies and altogether
was considered to have had the bet
ter of the repartee.
On being questioned by Captain Mor
net. the prosecutor, why. considering
the volume of business transacted by
him. h kept no books or records. Bolo
replied:
"I am master of money. not its
sclave."
Bolo asserted that the money he re
ceived from Abbas Hilmi former khed
Ive of Egypt, through Filippo Cavalil
nie. an Italian who is alleged to have
taken $4ihi.ihk to Bolo Pasha's hotel
in Paris, in Aprir." 1913. was tn repay
ment of a loan made to the khedive in
1M4. Bolo asserted that he obtained
the abdication of Abbas Hilmi and de
clared that he used a!l his influence
to have the former khedive exert his
energi-s in the interest of the entente.
Bolo's explanation ir his activities
in Switierland had not been completed
when court adjourned tor the day.
Courtroom Crowded
The courtroom was crowded when
Bolo appeared, but the assembly made
up principally of witnesses or Interest
ed parties, as the general public was
excluded so far as was possible. Bolo
was accompanied by his fellow defend
ant. Darius lYn-here. and listened stol
idly and unmoved to the reading of the
long indictments, which charged him
with having maintained communica
tion with the enemy and with treason.
A conspicuous figure in the courtroom
was Madame Bolo. who was surround
ed by a number of friends who will
testi'y during the proceedings.
As soon as the Indictment had

an adjournment, taking the ground
that certain witnesses would be un

a number of civilians wre;kii!ed o

The communication says:

the attack was a sudden one and the
Germans placed a heavy barrage along
the Ameikan line of several kilome

avidity a u.l with their T.Vs tore up
the German from trenches, blew up
several of the dugouts and cut tletr
barbed wire entanglements, causing
damage hih it will require several
days to repair. L'ttle damage was
done the American positions. Seem
ingly the Americans outgamed the en
emy on his initial point gf assault,
and later even extended their xonct
of bombardment over a wide region.
On the other battle fronts the opera

minor character, although the artil

In. France. After weeks of watchful
waiting there still is no indications
that the Germans contemplate at an

Liniments Will Never Care.
If yoa are afflicted with Rheuma
tism, why waste time with liniments,
lotions and other local applications
that never did cure Rheumatism, and
never will?
Do not try to rub the pain away,
for you will never succeed. Try the
sensible plan of finding the cause ef
the pain, and go after that. Remove
the cause, and there can be no pain.
You will never be rid of Rheuma
tism until you cleanse your blood ef
the germs that cause the diseases.
S. S. S. has never had an equal as a
blood purifier and scores of sufferers
say that it has cleansed their blood oi
Rheumatism, and removed all trace
of the disease from their system.

looking to restraining the commission
from meddling further in the afi'aits

It would not be so bad if someone would insist upon
putting sense in the press censorship. But that is to
much to expect in these parlous days.
The first thought of the men in the cantonments is
the tub and the razor which is enough to make her
very sore as she fondly imagines he is thinking of her
Consider the case of little Servia in contrast with
Russia. It was only upon the assurance and even the
insistence of Russia that Servia dared to resist the
Austro-German demands. Once in the war Servia .fought
bravely and successfully against the Austrian, and was
only overwhelmed when on Mackenson made his drive
with the combined Teutonic and Bulgarian hordes while
the allies stood supinely by. With her entire country
overrun, her king and court fugitives and her people
dispersed or worse than slaves, this little nation has
never whimpered or whispered of any peace except peace
with victory- The remnants of her army fight still at
Saloniki and her rulers and her people talk only of final
victory or death. Bpt Russia, the big blunderer, blnb
berer, blatherskite and bnncoist, quit cold and went all
to pieces under the test. And Rumania, also betrayed
by Russia, still wishes to fight on with honor. And
Belgium, all but destroyed, talks only of a peace that
her children can point to with pride. Blood will tell.
And the Russian blood oh, well, Trotiky and Lenine
are the natural heirs and of course they succeeded to
the house, the estates and the incumbrances.
A Bisbee workingman came to the Review editor the
other day to comment upon the Socialist editorial of
last week. Take it all in all. lie liked it. he said, but
was inclined to take exceptions to the impression con
veyed that the Socialist movement is a menace. "So
cialism cannot be a menace," he argued, "because it
comes from the ranks of the workers." It ought not to,
that is true, and it could not, as this worker says, if
only the man who works promulgated and interpreted
its doctrines and conducted its activities and guided its
affairs. But, unfortunately, no matter what state it
comes in direct from the workers, it is diverted by lead
ers WHO DO NOT WORK to purposes of their own.
In the name of the worker and the deed of the leader.
The cause is of the worker and the effect is of the lead
er. The worker wants to better his condition; so does
the labor leader. So the leader stirs up a lot of trouble
and raises a row and attacks industry and tears down
this and hammers at that, opposing blindly every form
of wealth and organization and industry and govern
ment. He does better his condition, gaining notoriety
and pay for his efforts, but the condition of the work
ingman is worse, after it is all over, than it was before.
And when the honor roll of humanitarianism was ca -led,
lo, Bisbee's name led all the rest- Yes, Bisbee!
Little old Bisbee. in a canyon of the Mule mountains,
ringed about by the desert and deep in the heart of the
wiM and woolly southwest, leads all the cities of these
United States in her love and kindness and unselfish
devotion to the orphan children of France. Leads a!l
cities in her giving in proportion to her population. And
leads in actual adoptions over most of the large cities
of the union. Consider, Los Angeles adopted 141 French
orphans and Bisbee 101. Cleveland, seventh city of the
union, adopted only 27. St. Louis, the fifth city, and set
tled by the French and named after a French king
adopted only 31. New York City, two hundred times as
large, adopted only eight times as many orphans as Bis
bee. Omaha, Denver. Seattle, San Antonio, Minneapolis,
all cities of 100.040. or more, adopted less than Bisbee
"Write me as one who loves his fellow men," said old
Abou Ben Adhem to the angel. And then the angel
came again, you. remember, "with all awakening light,

lo. Ben Adhem's name led all the rest."
Germany is in worst shape than she really is. Be sure
that Germany's real skeletons of impending disaster will
never be allowed to shake a bone in the closet so the
world can hear until that disaster breaks a storm.
A SERIOUS CHARGE.
(From Boston Commercial.)
John R. Rathom. editor of the Providence Journal, is
probably the most efficient servant of the government
not on the public payroll. His service in exposing Ger
man spies and plots has won for him the warmest grat
itude of the American people.
He has delivered the goods in every case where he
has made charges and it is safe to say that probably no
man in the country today is more feared nor more
cordially hated by the kaiser.
These facts give a grave seriousness to the following
charges which he makis against Secretary Baker and
the attitude of the government, as at present adminis
tered. against spies:
"I do not see how we can hope to win this war with
a pacifist, a professed pacifist, an out-and-out pacifist
at the head of the war department. Mr. Baker is an
honest and well-intentioned man. but he makes no at
tempt to disguise the fact that he is a pacifist.
"He has appointed to important posts in the depart
ments under him a number of rabid socialists, a ma
jority of whom are rabid pacifists and some of whom
are German pacifists. There are altogether too many
Germans on guard in our governmental departments.
There are too many Germans at our army camps, and
but little progress is being made toward stamping them
out.
"Three were recently taken at Detroit with full proof
of their guilt, but for some reason or other they were
allowed to go. A great many German spies who have
been under arrest have been freed, nobody knows why
"We shall never make progress asainst German spies
in this country until the present system, which is dead
wrong, is changed. The practice is now. when evidence
is found to indicate that a certain man is a German spy.
to look into the law books and find out if there is not
some clause in some law which makes it possible not
to arrest him. If no such clause can be found, the next
step is to look into the ancient laws and see if there
isn't something in them which might prevent the man
from being arrested."
These are serious charges. Judging by past experi
ences, Mr. Rathom has the name, the date and the place
to back them up.
Our treatment of spies is such as to encourage rather
than discourage them. If caught, the worst that can
happen to them is that they will be sent south to winter
at some healthy place end while possibly they will b!
kept interned .during the war, at its close they will be
free.
They have nothing much to lose if they are caught
and much to gain if they are not. so they continue to
ply their nefarious trade. Xo other nation in the world
is so lenient with spies. The bumanitari?nism which
prompts such treatment of spies entirely overlooks the
danger of their presence to the American people.
The charges of Mr. Rathom are either true or false
and the burden of proof is on the administration.

Take the story of strikes and disorders in Germany
with a grain of salt; yes, a handful of salt. And do not
build upon them at all. Here is Berlin's last word ol
these strikes: "The government has taken the neces
sary measures against a further extension of the strike.'
Simple and brief, this, but words of terrible omen and
menace, nevertheless. "Necessary measures" may mean
anythingrom the bayonet point or bullet to the prison
cell or execution. German measures, as the world has
come well, to know, are not. those of gentleness or coer
cion. The iron hand is the only hand the German knows.
And again, the German censorship is ironclad and ab
solute. The leakage is so slight as to he almost neglible.
If the strike stories sent out from behind the kaiser's
lines are even partly true, they were allowed to go be

HOLLAND TO BE PUNISHED.
Germany's government and its controlled newspapers,
are angry because Holland Jias agreed that our govern
ment shall have the use, for a time, of the eighty-two
Dutch ships which have been lying at our ports for seven
months, says the New York Times. Owners of the ves
sels have been blacklisted at Berlin. Holland, it is as
serted, is guilty of a breach of neutrality. This com
plaint comes from a nation whose submarines have sunk
150 Dutch ships- and not less than 1000 belonging to.
other northern European neutrals, at the same time kil
ling thousands of sailors. Two days before the agree
ment was signed in London, the submarines captured a
Dutch vessel loaded with food and towed her to a Ger
man port. The world knows how much respect Germany
has shown for the rights of neutrals. With the com
plaint there is a threat. Says the Frankfurter Zeitun;:
"If neutrals sell themselves to our enemies, then the
fight against this neutral tonnage of which the Western
Powers will avail themselves is one of the duties to
which our navy must and will devote itself with re
doubled energy and success."
It can be forseen tht Germany's submarines w i!
strive to sink the Dutch ships. But not many of them,
while controlled by our government, will go within reac.'i
of the pirates. A majority are to make trips to South
America. Australia, and Java. Five, however, will carry
food for Switzerland to a French port, and a consider
abel number will be required for the transportation of
150.000 tons or food to Belgium. These will be in danger.
The record shows that Germany does not hesitate to
sink Belgian relief ship3. even when they bear her writ
ten guarantees of immunity. And so there will prohably
be additions to neutral Holland's list of 150 vessels sunk
by her kind neighbors while she was supplying: them
with food.
The German government knows that Holland con
sented unwillingly and after long delay, for two reasons.
In no other way could she get the grain and other com
modities which she needs, and only hy permitting use
of the ships could seizure of them be prevented. Seimre
would have deprived her of the ships for a long time:
under the agreement she regains them after one round
trip. But Germany will show no consideration for Hol
lands need or the desire to avoid seizure. Undoubtedly,
she will sink the ships if her submarines t an find laern.
and their sailors will be fortunate if the pirates are mt
instructed to tink "without trace."

TO THE PEOPLE
OF BISBEE
Oil Talk No. 1
By M. W- LANG
I have just coma from the PECOS VALLEY OIL
FIELD. New Mex ico, and 1 want to tell all you goody
people of Bisbee what we have down there.
EMINENT -GEOLOGISTS tell us that we have,
what will ultimately be the largest oil field in the
SOUTHWEST.
We have proved that there is oil there in commer
cial quantities. Scattered all over the PECOS VALLEY
are water wells that have from 50 to 1 50 feet of oil in
them. This oil is of the highest quality, containing from
30 to 40 per cent gasoline.
An experienced and successful oil man of Okla
homa, after going over this field, had this to say: "If
any county in Oklahoma had one-half the oil and gas
indications as has this field, there would be a rig on
every 10-acre tract within thirty days."
The structural formations, the surface indications
supported by the numerous showings of oil and gas in
many of artesian wells has convinced geologists that
one of the largest inter-continental oil fields will be
developed in southeast New Mexico.
Read What Some of the Most Eminent Geologists Have
to Say About the PECOS VALLEY
Mr. C. A. Fisher.
iCursuiting Geologist of High Standing.)
"I have no neMiar.ry from my study of t! e P-ho? Valley Field, in
reccmtiieihlirg that steps are justified for th necessary expenditure
warranted, to fuliy te?t the c.-m.-:err:al saturations ol" the cil bearing

Mr Kobt. T. li !1.

"Th tieelcgica! me-.sures known as the carTTor.u'erous limestone,

saturated with asphnltunt and selphur oil. and there is every indica

Mr Milton M.-TVhnrter.

For 2 Cents Per Share Now
ON OR BEFORE SUNDAY, FEBRUARY 10TH, THE PRICE OF
THIS STOCK POSITIVELY WILL BE RAISED, AND THEN AN
OTHER BIG SPECULATIVE OPPORTUNITY WILL HAVE SUP
PED BY YOU
Complete Equipment Purchased
The UNITED CH1NO OIL & REFINING COMPANY, owning
outright a vast territory in the CHINO VALLEY, the prospective oil
producing field of this state, and controlling more than one thousand,
five hundred acres, stands ready to place before you today the evi
dence that they have done what they have said they WOULD DC
and that is SPEND THEIR STOCKHOLDERS MONEY TOWARD
THE ACTUAL DEVELOPMENT OF THEIR PROPERTY.
We have ALREADY BOUGHT a standard drilling equipment
which is complete in every detail, and when we say COMPLETE
we mean just exactly that.
There will be no delays in our development campaign, through
lack of proper equipment, or through inferior equipment not capable
of doing the work. We have a COMPLETE EQUIPMENT, used for
drilling deep wells for the SANTA FE RAILROAD in the Northern
part of this state an equipment which a mechanical expert pronounc
ed the most complete he has ever handled in his life an equipment
absolutely guaranteed to go FIVE THOUSAND FEET, if necessary
for drilling. .
Our derrick lumber, absolutely new material for a STANDARD
84 FOOT DERRICK that will handle three strings of pipe is bought
and paid for and when this goes to press is ?t the railroad station- near
est to our property m the CHINO VALLEY, from where it will be
taken by motor truck to the field.
ALL OF THIS EQUIPMENT including heavy bits and reamers
EVERYTHING ON EARTH WE NEED.
The Advice of an Expert
Further, this company is not going to take long chances by simply
putting down a well at the most convenient spot. We have made
it a point to acquire land in various sections of the valley, and we have
arranged to have TWO OIL EXPERTS from the producing fields of
California, make a thorough study of the valley, and spot our well
for us on what they believe to be the place with the most logical in
dications for bringing in oil in commercial quantities. THESE MEN
KNOW THEIR BUSINESS and we honestly believe that a well, dril
led on the spot they choose will result in OIL and in STUPENDOUS
PROFITS FOR YCU, if you ccme in on this proposition NOW.
An Old Time Expert in Charge
We have closed a contract with Mr. H. M. Johnson to take charge
of our drilling campaign. There can be no doubt as to the ability of
Mr. Johnson. For the past twenty years he has been in PRACTICAL
association with the Doheny oil interests in Mexico and with the
UNION OIL COMPANY in California, and he is giving" up a hand
some salary in Southern California and joining in with us. taking a
LARGE PORTION of his salary in stock, because after investigation
he believes the CHINO VALLEY of Arizona is to become a big oil
producing district, and because he KNOWS the men back of the
UNITED CHINO OIL & REFINING COMPANY are spending the
stockholder's money toward DEVELOPMENT he knows we mean
BUSINESS, because he KNOWS the equipment we have purchased
and the aggressiv manner in which we are pushing this proposition.
We Mean Business
Just as certain as we live, we are going down into the ground
after the oil. You can gamble your last dollar that the UNITED
CHINO OIL & REFINING COMPANY is going to prove, absolutely,
whether or not there is oil to be had in commercial quantities on its
large acreage in the CHINO VALLEY.
Be a Pioneer for Big Profits
THE CHINO VALLEY has every indication for BIG OIL geol
ogists, including the representative of the UNIVERSITY OF ARIZO
NA, state that the field certainly is worthy of development and it
is a conceded fact that there HAS BEEN OIL IN THE VALLEY, be
cause it was discovered there several years ago in a test well, which
was lost through improper handling. It certainly seems that it is only
necessary to DRILL to have oil reward us and that we are positively
going to do.
What more can any man or woman ask, who has an atom of the
"take a chance" spirit in his or her make-up, and where the profit pos
sibilities are so enormous? WHY LISTEN DO YOU REALIZE
THAT WHEN WE STRIKE OIL, a small Fifty or One Hundred Dol
lar investment of j-our part, at the present price, WILL MEAN AN
INDEPENDENCE FOR YOU?
Remember, it is in the unproven field that the great big profits
are always made by the moderate investor. A district that is already
proved up does not offer you a chance to make a lot of money from
advance in shares. AFTER THE FIELD IS PROVED, it takes lots
of money to buy shares and then there is a greater chance for them
to DECREASE in price, than for them to INCREASE.
Buy NW-Right. Today
The thing for every-blooded men and women in this state to
do,, if they have a few dollars to spare, is to BUY SHARES NOW,
in the cleanest and most legitimate oil sDeculation ever offered to you
BUY NOW shares of the UNITED CHINO OIL & REFINING
COMPANY.
DON'T FORGET that the BIG MONEY that the small investor
has made in every oil field in the United States, was made by share
h6lders in the legitimate companies. BEFORE the field was developed
and proved. In these fields, shareholders who invested ONE HUN
DRED DOLLARS, have waked up some mornine to find that they
were worth FORTY-ONE THOUSAND DOLLARS and in some in
stances even more.
You can bank your last dollar on the men who are behind this
company they live in Arizona they have their entire interests here
they hold responsible political and economic positions which they
MUST uphold, by personally seeing to it that you get a CLEAN RUN
FOR YOUR MONEY. If "we fail to get OIL, you can rest assured
that it won't be because we don't go down into the ground after it
because WE ARE GOING DOWN.
Shares Will Positively Advance in Price by Feb. 10th
YOU OWE IT TO YOURSELF, TO YOUR FAMILY, TO YOUR FUTURE, TO AT LEAST TAKE A SMALL BLOCK OF STOCK
IN THIS COMPANY, FOR THE POSSIBLE PROFITS THAT WILL MEAN SO MUCH TO YOU IF WE STRIKE OIL. FRANKLY
WHAT IS $50.00 OR $100.00 TO YOU IT DOESNT AMOUNT TO MUCH. BUT HOW WOULD YOU LIKE TO HAVE SEV
ERAL THOUSANDS OF DOLLARS THAT SHOULD RESULT FROM THIS SMALL INVESTMENT IF WE STRIKE OIL
WOULDN'T IT DO YOU MORE GOOD THAN ALL THE MONEY YOU COULD SAVE BY YEARS OF PERSONAL SACRIFICE?
THINK IT OVER IT IS WORTH THINKING ABOUT AND IS IS WORTHY OF IMMEDIATE ACTION ON YOUR PART. RE
MEMBER THIS YOU CAN SAVE ALL YOUR LIFE. BUT YOU'LL NEVER MAKE A FORTUNE UNLESS YOU ARE WILLING
TO TAKE A CHANCE.
Place Your Order This Payday Sure At 2V2C Per Share Now
THE PRICE OF THIS STOCK WILL BE RAISED ON OR BEFORE THE TENTH OF THIS MONTH. YOU CAN PLACE YOUR
ORDER NOW, EITHER THROUGH OUR AGENTS OR WITH THE OFFICES OF THE COMPANY DIRECT, AND IF YOU CANT

The 100 Per Cent Advance Means That on the Morning of February 8th You
Will Pay 20 Cents for Arizona Oil & Refining Company Shares
lCc DOWN AND 10c WHEN WE STRIKE OIL IN COM
MERCIAL QUANTITIES
The ARIZONA OIL& REFINING COMPANY is a
success because it has everlastingly kept at it. It is a
success becarse the company has actually started opera
tions. The Company has the finest equipment possible. It is
a!I oald for. It is estimated that it cannot be duplicated
under $20,000.
The Company has a- substantial treasury and the next
few days will complete we believe the financing of this
Company. ,
The following geologists have reported on the Chino
Valley oil fields: Dr. E. A. Edwards, Dr. Etienne A. Rit
ter. E. Ronald Sager, Alexander Roy, L. P. Mprgan.
At last comes a State Institution the Arizona Bu
reau of Mines, connected with the University of Arizona
at Tucson. The report of this latter institution is con
servative. It isn't boosting anj-body, but it boosts the Chi
no Valley oil fields.
Now it is only a matter of drilling and the ARIZONA
OIL & REFINING COMPANY is d.-illing they are not
poing to drill but they are drilling and will continue to
drill.
'e predict right now that on February 8 when we
take an account of stock of the actual sales mads that
the entire balance of the Cucitalization of the ARIZONA
OIL & REFINING COMPANY will have been oversub

snares. Mere is the one
argument the one point where this company is different there is no promotion stock no pool stock to be unloaded on the public when
ih stock is listed. The onlv source of surply for the shares will be from the stockholders themselves who own the shares who have
bought and paid for them. The public the s:okholders in a company if they beiive in an enterprise don't sell on an advancing mar
ket and an advancing market always accompanies an operating company especially an cil company that is actually drilling in a proven
field. If there is no one to sell ttieir shares and there are plenty of buyers and buyers at tiie market will carry the stock to hiph T.sures
even before oil is actually struck.
We predict and believe we are conservative that ARIZONA OIL i- KKKIMNG COMPANY sJiares will sell on the streets of PHOENIX
at 40c to 50e a share within the nest 30 days and perhaps sooner.
Then This Is the Last Opportunity to Buy Arizona

lovers of Eisbee and vicinity there iias never appeared in this city
an attraction more worthy of the paircuape that has everywhere been
accorded this most excellent comedy. The Denver newspapers durin?
the engagement there were unanimous in their unstinted praise and
the numerous persocal requests caused a return engagement, a never-before-heard-of
event in Denver. The New York papers during all
of the past season and the Chicago papere during the entire summer
of 1916 were also unanimous. This is the only attraction ever known
to ir.afce two transcontinental tours in one season. It appeared at
tie Broadwey Theater, Denver, for it second engagement the w(.)k
closing Jan. 15th. The original cast and production will appear in
Eisi.ee Tuesday and Wednesday. February 12 and 13. Prices 50c to

presented in Bisfcee.
