Campbell-Hunt Contest
FURTHER ARGUMENT
INVITED BY COURT

Found for Campbell, Mak

(By Review Leased Wire)
PHOENIX. Jan. 9. In sustaining
motion of Attorney Ives to eliminate
a portion of pleading of Judge Sloan,
in the latters application- for a writ
to compel George Hunt to give up the
executive office to Governor Camp
bell, the supreme court today gave
its opinion that the only officer au
thorized to canvass returns and issue
election certificates is the Secretary
of State.
The matter stricken out or the com- i
plaint is explained as merely pre
cautionary, and placed in pleading
because the Campbell attorneys un
derstood that Hunt "attorneys were in
tending to attack validity of Secre
tary Osborn's certificate, as a basis
for claim upon appurtenances of ex
ecutive office. In striking out this
extra matter, court, in the opinion
of Judge Sloan, has justified ,use of
certificate of election,- as basis for
such claim.
Hunt's contention, after certificate
had been issued, was that the secre
tary was not empowered to issue said
certificate, that the constitutional
provision defining his powers was not
self executing, null and void in ab
sence of legislative enactment. It
was also contended that governor's
commission to elective officers was
the only valid title.
With every matter before it relative
to governorship contest disposed of
by this decision, supreme court will
next take up mandamus hearing pro
per. The court, speaking through
Chief Justice Franklin stated, how
ever, that respondent might submit
ndditional argument and authorities
touching preliminary motion.
Judge Sloan considered the deci
sion victory for Campbell, that it
sustained his own contention that Os
born's certificate was proper evidence
of the title of the big sombrero to
the second floor suite labeled "Gov
ernor's office." "The hearing on the
writ is to be held tomorrow," he said,
"and the respondent can put in all
the additional arguments he wants to,
but the burden of proof will rest with
him, to show is there isany other
qualified canvassing tribunal than the
secretary of state."
Legislature Organized
PHOENIX, Jan. 9. Completion of
-organization and appointment of com
mittees was the only work attempted
by the Third Arizona State Legisla
ture today. Following the appoint
ment of attaches and naming of com
mittees both houses adjourned until
Thursday morning, by which time it
is believed the governorship problem
will have been solved by a supreme
court decision as to bo is entitled to
hold the office.
C. P. Hicks of Yavapai county was
elected secretary of the senate and
Alfred Tripnel of Maricopa, assistant
secretary. Rev. Bertrand C. Cocks of
?icopa was made chaplain of the
senate.
Nine additional ballots for Campbell
were found today in the bottom of a
ballot box. The ballots had been re
jected by the election board. This
raises Compbell's net gain from the
inspection to 164.

CHICAGO, Jan. 9. Thomas Costello,
who, according to State Attorney
Hoyne, was the "directing genius of
the system for exacting tribute from
vicious resorts, gambling dens and
troni policemen who. sought promo
tion," has made a confession in con
nection with the graft charges which
led to the arrest of Chief of Police
Healey and others, Hoyne 'announced
tonight. Lieutenant Agustus Martin
While also has confessed, Hoyne said.
According to Mr. Hoyne, Lieutenant
White in his admission, laid most of
the blame on Costello, and Costello,
according to Mr. Hoyne, said that
Chief Healy was the person respon
sible for the system.
Healy," said Mr. HOyne, "has been
quoted as saying that he saw Costello
two or three times in the last ten
years. According to Costello s confes
sion and reports of my detectives who
have shadowed every move of the
chief for months, they saw each other

the chiefs share of the tribute to the

bribery and conspiracy against Chief
of Police Charles Healy.
The chief, during whose administra

the city, wrote what is probably his
last communication to the city coun

appropriation of $50,000 to analyze
beer and other drinks taken in saloon
raids. Chief Healy's resignation ef
fective January 11, has been accepted
by Mayor Thompson. His successor's
name will go to the council Thursday

The chiefs bond, which was set at
$100,000 last night, was reduced to

SUFFRAGISTS

HOUSE
Leaders of Women's Congres
sional Union Adopt What is
Termed as Beginning of
"Militant" Campaigning.
DECISION FOLLOWS.
CALL ON PRESIDENT
Wilson Reiterates His Person
al Idea Toward the Cause,
But Declines to Pledge His
Party to Any Course.
(By Review Leased Wire)
WASHINGTON, Jan. 9. Woman
suffragists after another futile appeal
to President Wilson today for his sup
port of the Susan B. Anthony amend
ment, announced plans for retaliation
by picketing the White House with
silence sentinals." Their purpose is
to make it impossible for the President
to enter or leave the. White House
without encountering a. sentinel bear
ing home device pleading the suffragist
cause.
The move was acknowledged to be
a step in the new policy of militancy
which began with the coup in the
House gallery on December 6, when
suffragists unfurled a "votes for wo
men" banner while the President was
making his opening address.
After the women had their audience
today, they returned to headquarters
of the Congressional I'nion and pledg
ed $3,000 for the "silent sentinel" cam
paign.
Headed by Miss Maud Younger and
Mrs. Sara Bard Field, 300 suffragists
from the Congressional Union went to
see the President ostensibly to pre
sent memorials on the death Of Mrs.
Inez Milholland Boissevain. Because
of the affair in the House gallery there
was some difficulty in arranging the
audience but the President consented
to receive the women. Whn they
made it the occasion to renew their
pleas that he support the suffrage
amendment the President expressed
his surprise, reniainded the spokes
man of the party that he had not been
appraised of their full purpose and
was not prepared to say any more
than he had on previous occasions. He
repeated that he believed, personally
in their cause but as the leader of his
party he could not commit it to action
it had not endorsed. The President
added he could not understand why
women failed to realize that the Demo
cratic party had done mOre for suf
frage than the Republicans.
I do not need to tell you where my
own convictions and my own personal
purpose lie," the President said, "and
1 need not tell you by what clrcum-
scriptions I am bound as the leader
of a party. As the leader of a party
my commands come frOm the party
and not from private personal con
victions. My personal action as a
citizen, of course, comes from no
source but my own convictions, and,
therefore, my position has been so
frequently defined and I hope so can
didly defined, and it is so impossible
for me until the orders Of my party
are changed to do anytning other than
I am doing as a party leader, that I
think nothing more is necessary to be
said. .
"I do want to say this: I do not
see how anybody can fail to observe
the utterances of the last campaign
that the Democratic party is more in
clined than the opposition party to
assist in this great cause, and it has
been a matter of surprise to me and
a matter of very deep regret that so
many of those who were heart and
soul for this cause seemed so greatly
to misunderstand and misinterpret the
attitude of the parties. Because in
this country as in every self-governing
country, it is only through the in
strumentalities of parties that thing'
can be accomplished. They are not
accomplished by the individual voice
but by concerted action and that ac
tion must come only as fast as you
can concert it. I have done my best
and 6hall continue to do my best to
concert it in the interest of a cause
in which I, personally, believe."

High Officials.
ADVERSE REPORT IS
EXPECTED TO HOUSE
Motions Citing Financier for
Contempt Pending Prob
ably Will Be Dropped When
Report Is Made. ,
(Bv Review Leased Wire)
WASHINGTON, Jan. 9. Although
Thomas W. Lawson promised .today
to disclose "names and amounts" In
volving men high in official life, if
Congress ordered an inquiry into the
alleged teak in jtnee oft President
Wilson's peace note, there- were in
dications tonight that the House rules
committee was about to drop its in
quiry on the Wood resolution for such
an inquiry and return' the resolution
to the House with an adverse report.
Democratic memDers or the com
mittee freely expressed their weari
ness over the proceedings of the past
days and their .conclusion that no
proof had been brought out so far.
Lawson continued today to defy the
committee, refusing over and over
again to give the names' of the men
he said he had been told profited by
the "leak" after suggesting that he
could name an official higher up than
any yet mentioned. Four motions to
cite him before the bar of the House
for contempt were pending when he
left the witness stand early in the
day were considered by the commit
tee in executive session. No decision
was reached but -some of the mem
bers indicated later that Mr. Lawson
would not be recalled and if it was
determined to report the Wood reso
lution unfavorably the contempt pro
ceedings would be forgotten.
The hearing will continue through
out tomorrow, at least, to give sev
eral of the men mentioned in the vari
ous reports and rumors related be
fore the .committee an opportunity to
make statements.
During the day's examination Mr.
Lawson frankly admitted that he was
not particularly concerned with the
so-called leak itself but his purpose
in agitating the subject primarily
was to bring about a thorough inves
tigation of the New York stock ex
change that would lead to incorpora
tion and federal control.
Departing from the direct line of
the investigation, chairman Henry
asked:
suppose congress should pass a
law requiring all these stock ex
changes to be incorporated and re
quiring that all transactions be made
a matter of public record, would not
that have a good effect?
I do not think so," the witness re
filled. "As it is today, every transac
tion is recorded. I do not see what
could be gained."

(By Review Leased Wire)
WASHINGTON. Jan. 9. The Shep
pard bill to abolish saloons 'In the
nttionnl capital after November 1,
1917, was passed by the Senate late
today and now goes to the House
where Its friends .claim it is assured
of passage. The vote in the Senate
was 55 to 32.
While the measure prohibits the
sale of liquor in the District of Col
umbia, it permits personal use. An
amendment which would have sub
mitted the proposal to the referendum
of citizens of the district was de-j
feated just before passage by a tie I
vote of 43 to 43. ' i
For the bill itself there were 28
Democrats and , 27 Republican votes
with S3 Democrats and 10 Republicans
against it. 'All the Progressives
vbted for passage.
The prohibiting language of the bill
says that after November 1, "No per
son or persons or any house, com
pany, association, club, or corpora
tion or lus agents, otnclal clerks, or
servants directly or indirectly, shall
in the District of Columbia manufac
ture for sale or gift, import for sale,
offer for sale, keep for sale, traffic
In. barter, export, ship out of the Dis
trict of Columbia or exchange for
for goods or merchandise, or solicit
or receive orders for the purchase
of 'any alcoholic liquors for beverage
purposes of for any other than scien
tific, medicinal, pharmaceutical, me
chanical, sacramental, or other non
beverage purposes."
Another section says the measure
shall not be construed to prevent the
"manufacture, importation, exporta
tion of sale," of denatured, methyl
alcohol or of ethyl alcohol for scien
tific, medicinal and like purposes, but
their manufacture and a sale are lim
ited to licensed druggists of manufac
turers. The so-called locker system
is specifically forbidden.
All common carriers bringing liq
uors into the Distrist are required to
keep a record of the shipper and con
signee, who must make affidavis that
they are for personal use.
Heavy penalties are provided for
violations, including a provision aimed
at physicians who prescribe liquor
for patients without cause. A right
to sue for damages on the person who
is injured," in person or property" in
consequence of intoxication is given
to blood relatives.
Efforts absolutely to forbid manu
facture in the district and export
from it were beaten without a rec
ord vote. An amendment hy Senator
Phelan which would permit sale of j
"wine, ale, beer and porter," also was I
defeated. i
There was evident a
spirit of bit-1
terness on the part of many senators
and a feeling of tension that was only
broken a few times when amendments
were offered or suggestions made
that the Senate and the galleries i
thought humorous. The spectators,
half their number women, made only
one real demonstration, that of hearty
approval when the final vote was an
nounced. Twice during the debate,
however, the noise became so' great
that President Pro Tempore Saulsbury
had to threaten to clear the gal
leries. While the Sheppard bill was under
consideration in the Senate legisla
tion to prohibit liquor traffic In
Hwail was ureed before the House
territories communities by represen
tatives of the anti-snloon league of

The invasion of Ktuuania by the
troops of the central powers con
tinues to progress, despite the efforU
'of the Russiajis and the Rumanians to
hold them back. Berlin reports that
the invaders moving eastward into
Moldavia from the Transylvanian Alps
region are gaining ground step by
step, while the force of Field Marshal
van Mackensen, driving northward in
Moldavia, has won additional ground,
reaching the Puma river sector. In
this lighting the Teutonic allies, ac
cording to Berlin, have taken 9,544
prisoners and captured three guns and
ten machine guns. Petrograd admits
that the Russians along the line of the
Putnii and Sereth rivers have fallen
back but says the maneuver was car
ried out without hindrance. A slight
retreat on the Kassina river by the
Russians also is recorded by Petrograd
but it is asserted that south of the
Oituz river and near Rekosa, on the
Suchitza river,, attacks by the troops
of the central p'owers were repulsed.
There is still vicious fighting going
on in northern Russia in the region
of Riga. Berlin says the reports of
Russian attacks on both sides of the
River AA and between Freidrichstadt
and the Mitau-Olai road.
The Russians, however, have re
captured an island in the Hvina river
north of IHoulsk, which was taken
from them recently. Petrograd re
ports also the repulse of German at
tacks south of Lake Babit, west of
Riga.
In the other theatres, according to
the various official communications,
bombardments and minor engage
ments by patrol parties continue to
prevail. Greece has been given 43
hours by the entente in which to com
ply with their demands for the with

Thursday, beginning a three days' en
sai;ement. mu.-t be inevitably associat
ed in the public mind with that other
Clune film triumph. "Kamona." Not
only was it made by the same pro
ducers but the same methods followed
in the construction of Helen Hunt
Jackson's wonderful sAry.
Like the other story. i "The Eyes of
the World" is a romance of Southern
California, and the producers have
put into their second great achieve
ment the same labor of love that was
mingled with the necessary commer
cialism in the making of the former
subject l'jr the screen
Having set such a hih standard
with "Ilamona", the Clune company
know that it could not afford to invite
disparaging comparison by turning out
an inferior sti' ces.--.or, so it spent
money freely and the undivided ener
gies, for six mouths, of its great studio
force in L'.is Angt les and on tht
scenes of the book in the valleys aaj
mountains of S;in Bernardino and Riv
erside counties to insure an output
worthy of its subject. The same pho
tographers who imtiit- "Kaiiiosia" a
work of such rare beauty were en
trusted with the mission.
Three "t the prominent members of
the "Kamona" cast are in "The Eyes
of the World". 'I lies- ar Monroe Sal
inhury, who played A!e.-.s:t:dro, the
Indian lover. Lurline. 'who enacted
Senoia Moreno, the Spanish matron,
and Arthur lavares, who was Senor
Ortega. These artists werf chosen for
"The Eyes of the World" cast liVit
merely because their characterizations
in "Kamona" were so remarkahle but
because they really lilted parts in Mr.
Wright's slory.
Clune v. as I he first of the big pro
ducers to discounige the idea of the
sto k company, which led to so many
causes of mis-casting'. For each pro
duction he picks his aciVrs from the
wiliest lield. How much belter this
is than the old way, was seen in the
wonderful selcitioii of types anil the
line quality of acting iu "Kamona."

Almost everyone knows that Sage
Tea and Sulphur, properly compound
ed, brings back the natural color and
lustre to the hair when faded, streaked
'or gray. Years ago the only way to
get this mixture was to make it at
home, which is mussy and trouble
some. Nowadays, by asking at any
drug store for "Wyeth's Sage and
Sulphur Compound," you will get a
large bottle of. this famous old recipe,
improved by the addition of jther in

Don't stay gray! Try it! No one
can possibly tell that you darken your
hair, as it does it so naturally and
evenly. Y'ou dampen a sponge or soft
brush with it and draw this thiugh
your hair, taking one small strand at
a time; by morning the gray hair dis
appears, and after another application
or two, your hair becomes beautifully

Two robberies occurred in the
Warren District last evening within
a short time of each other. The first
happened in Warren and the last in
Lowell. In neither case were the
highwaymen apprehended though
good descriptions were obtained.
Theodore Bergquist of Warren, who
conducts a small store there, was the
first victim. His assailant approach
ed, pointing a revolver at him, and
ordered him to throw up his hands.
The robber took $16 out of his pocket.
He missed a much larger sum in one
of his hip pockets.
T. A. Mize, cashier of the Bisbee
Auto Company, was the other victim,
1 he robher in this instance used a

PROGRESS IN EAST
Berlin Maintains Central Pow

Up the East.
(By Review Leased Wire)
BERLIN", Jan. 9. (Wireless to
Tuckerton). The military critic of
the Overseas News Agency In an ar
ticle concerning the fighting in Ru
mania says:
'The eastern part of the southern
bank of the Sereth river together
with the town of itraila fell Into the
hands of the central powers, January
"i, and combats of January after the
conquest of Fokshani. headed the fate
of .'the western bridge head of the
southern Screth position. Great Rus
sian thrust, launched at the eleventh
hour in an attempt to regain tho
southern bank of the Sereth was with
out effect in spite of great violence.
The Russians were sanguinarily re
pulsed on the entire kilometer
front, succeeding in pushins forward
at only one small position. The con
quest of Fokshani made this small
success of no effect.
Northwest of Fokshani the Rus-I
sians have been thrown from strongly
fortitied positions on the Moldavian
hills, and their second line of de
fense on the canal between Fokshani
and the mountains has been pierced.
The conquest by a storming band of
one thousand meter high summit
of a mountain was one of the most
brilliant deeds of the Rumanian cam-
ian troops and cost the Russian de
fenders, the most important point of
support of their right v.ing position.
The assailants, having coriqoered the
dominating mountains have secured
iberty of motion against the plain.
The troops of the central powers on
the whole front are rapidly and vic
oriously moving ahead."

CAMPAIGN CONTRIBUTIONS.
There's nothing really radical about the new measur
framed in the United States senate for the control of
campaign expenditures. The amount that may be spent
in behalf of a presidential candidate is limited to $1,500,
000. That amounts to only about a cent and a half per
inhabitant. Looked at in that way, it's little enough. It's
about 8 cents per voter nothing alarming in that, either.
Few votes can be bought for. eight cents apiece. An i
judged by common standards, it looks like little enough
to pay the usual legitimate costs of rental for headquar
ters, clerical hire, stationery, postage, hall rent, speakers'
expenses, etc.
Even that low f gure may be cut down, however, in the
future. In spite of the much larger population that has
to be reached, there appears less and less excuse for foirj
political funds. It becomes obvious that the voters can
be reached and informed regarding all the issues of the
campaign without resorting to the old spectacular meth
ods and lavish distribution of money and publicity mut
ters. Costly excursions and torchlight processions have al
most vanished. Less money is spent on "getting out the
vote." Bribery, once an important item, under whatever
disguise, is now almost unheard of. Even political meet
ings 'iave become less essential. The reading of news
papers 'is now so general, and they present the facts ami
arguments of the campaign so fully and clearly, that
campaigns are today really fought out in the papers.
Public speeches are still important only because of the
wide audiences they obtain when printed next day. Al
most the , same effect would be gained by botli sides
merely giving out statements for publication. In fact,
the last campaign was waged primarily by this very
method. .
Newspapers today are almost universally so fair that
they willingly give space to any statement from either
side important enough to be classed as news, confining
their own viewpoint to the editorial column. Statements
that are not news, but mere partisan appeals to voters or
answers to an opponent, can be properly printed as paid
advertisements, and are being printed so more and more.
It all tends to make campaigns more rational, calm and
honest, as well as less expensive.
TRAVELING BY EAR.
In dark London, nocturnal tram car passengers ara
learning to locate their stops by sounds. They know the
particular clicks of the wheels on the rails, the gratings
and rattlings, the ear-piercing sound made when rounding
the curves for every section of their journey to and from
home or work or play. The long, smooth stretches, Ww.
tumps, all have their special sounds and feeling. The
passenger knows them and gets off at the right place.
It is said there are fewer mistakes than there were ia
the days of the powerful arc light.
It's just another instance of the fact we are already fa
miliar with in blind people. People wJio could use all
their senses for their own guidance and in formation noi
only neglect their other senses, but fail to use their eyes
to their fullest powers. Those who must of necessity
use only the other senses of hearing and touch develop
them to great skill and accuracy. Why must we wait
until we are deprived of part of our gifts before we learn
their value? Why not take the trouble to cultivate all
our powers right now while we have Uiom all?
HOLIDAYS FPR CONVICTS.
North Carolina still has its convict camps, but its trcat
incnt of the prisoners has changed vastly. They were all
iven Uiree holidays during Christmas week.
The Christmas vacation applied to 2,900 men. The or
dinary prisoners were excused from work during those
days. The trusties were permitted to go home. .More
remarkable still, they were all given J1U checks to take
Jiomc.as Christmas gifts to their families.
That Christmas bonus was conferred on 1113 prisoners,
at the instance of (Jovcruor Craig. The governor admitte-1
that there might lie no legal authority for it, but insisted
that it he paid just the banie, tid promised that if the
state failed to authorize it he would pay the $0,150 out of
his own pocket.
'Rather different, isn't it, from the time when civilized
nations used to brand criminals with a hot iron and chain
them in solitary cells for life? Dut a heap more sensible,
for scores of these North Carolina convicts are in pro
cess of becoming good, useful citizens.
THE AMATEUR ACCOUNTANTS.
January once was sacred among humorists to jo'-ccs
about broken New Year's resolutions concerned with
male appetites for alcohol and tobacco. Now it is t'.ie
amateur accountant who reigns. A writer in the New
York Tribune, for example, has this to say on the last
day of 1916:
"Tomorrow morning approximately 92,000.000 people in
these United States will make another stab at keeping
personal and household accounts for the coming yecr.
One month from tomorrow there will be approximately
73 of these left in the race. Of these, GO will be groggy
but still game and willing to lump the difference between
the actual balance in their pockets and the theoretical
balance in the bocks under "General Expenses" or "In
cidentals" and start again for February. The remaining
thirteen, who came out even, will be either professors of
accounting in business schools, or out and out unreliable."
What a sense of hope this conveys to the starters!
And what comfort in the realization that the thirteen
who come out even aren't fairly in their class! Thev
are either professionals or they cheat. We had long
vaguely suspected some such thing, but kept on morbidly
blaming our weakmindedness for our lack of success.
Then Stevenson :mid it wasn't the arrival that counted,
but keeping on theroad. Suppose we do get groggy
after a month of unaccustomed intellectual activity. So
leng as we stay game, we're all right. A certain school
room which sent out a very high percentage of successful
people was found to have across its front wall in big let
ters: "Not Failure, but Low Aim Is Crime."
And since. every other publication in the country is
giving advice to the accountants at this time, let us not
be remiss in our duty. Here is cur platform:
To account is better than not to account. To start is
better than not to start. Even if you keep at it but one
month, that record gives you more to go on than not'.?.
And if you stuck it out six weeks last year, perhaps you
can run three months this time, and longer next. One
great difficulty with the amateurs is that they think ac
counting, unlike everything else in life, ought to come out
right the first time. Not so. Like any other habit, it
must be formed out of many failures.
There's nothing that gives one" a better moral brace
than facing tfie result of an inquiry, however brief, into
one's economic habits. They indicate the progress made
toward self-control, common sense, human kindliness and
everything else.
CIVIL EMPLOYEES CO-OPERATING.
The employees of New York City and there are 87,000
of them are organizing themselves for the purpose of
co-operative buying. Ways and means for putting the
system into effect as soon as possible are being dis
cussed, committees are appointed and the whole thing
is moving with an order ar.d deflniteness that speak for
success.
The Civil Employees Co-operative Purchasing Associa
tion, as it is to be called, will have for its immediate aim
the unceremonious extractiou of the retailer's profit from
the high, cost of living. Later it expects to do better yet.
Although the project is new, wholesalers are taking no
tice and have already sent their agents to confer with
committee heads. Distributing agents will be located in
every building. Not a department will be left out, from
teachers and firemen to street cleaners. The mayor him
self will have his chance to save in the co-operative buy
ing. The Law Department has had such a co-operative store
system for some time. Although it has been run by crude
methods it has netted a saving of 15 per cent. It,, has
handled butter and eggs, onions, grape fruit, and lately,
Christmas candy in large consignments.
The plan has heen tried with more or 'less success in
various groups or communities in the United States. But
it has never been attempted on anywhere near so larg?
a scale in this country. England has lev the way wit'i
her consumers' associations and co-operative stores. It it
succeeds and there seems to be no reason why it should
not it will lie a big thing that city employees in ether
cities may be expected to follow. And not only city em
ployees, but those of all branches of government. And
eventually it may be taken up by the employees cf various
industries in short, by any economic group whose mem
bers have natural facilities for co-operating in such matters.
WOMEN IN WASHINGTON.
Miss Jeanette Rankin, the first woman congressman. Is
to tiring witli her, when she reaches Washington, the first
woman secretary that any member of congress has ever
had. It's perfectly natural and lilting. It sort of goes
with the job. It preserves the appropriate atmosphere,
whether that atmosphere be regarded as one of states
manship or of politics.
There are woman secretaries in every other. line of
business why not in lawmaking? There are thousands
of women employed by men and preferred to male secre
taries he-cause of their faithfulness and efficiency. The
only weighty reason that can be given for the hitherto
unbrokcu regime or mule .secretaries at Washington i.-;
that meu arc more useful politically to their statcsmcn
bosscs than wouicu would be. They look attiT tll.'ir
employers' pulitical fences, keep the "boys" lined up aii'l
perforin valuable services in campaigns. Lut this con
sideration loses all its force when applied to u states
wouiuu. Miss Rankin has proved herself a wonder as a practical
politician. Iter new secretary is credited with similar
tiilcnt. The combination harmonizes with the sentiment
of the state iliey represent which is 'enthusiastically
feminist. These two women will probably show Wash
ington something new in the political line. And before
they get through, there may be a demand in Washington
for women secretaries even on the part of male states
men from non-suffrage Mates.

Give His Charge to the Jury
Today Private Life of De

SAN FRANCISCO, Jan. 9. Trial
of Franz Bopp, German consul gen
eral here, and four aides for conspir
acy to dynamite entente munitions
ships and trains, closed l;4e today
in the United States district court
here, Judge Wm. H. Hunt will give
the jury his charge tomorrow. U.
S. District Attorney John W. Pres

bitter attack on the private life of
Charles C. Crowley, chief secret agent j
of the German consulate, and as a !
consequence left the federal building
guarded by deputy United States mar
shals. Friends feared Crowley might I
attempt a personal encounter which I
seen.ed imminent in the court room
when attorneys for the defense re
strained Crowley.
Preston's back was turned to Crow
ley at the time, and he continued to
announce his points without becom- j
ing aware of Crowley's agitation.
Charges by the defense that agents
of the British government were be

by Preston as "false and slanderous." j
convictions entail maximum sen
tences of three years imprisonment
and $15,000 fines each.

spread before the jury on a black-,
board as Preston made his plea- j

quit the case." He upheld Louis J.
Smith, defendant, and government in

immunity for his story.
Smith said he was hired at $H00 a
month and he operated with Crowley
in Tacoma and Seattle trying to
bomb munition ships and that they
attempted dynamiting in eastern
Canada.
The defense admitted that both
Smith and Crowley were employed as
consulate agents, but not for dyna
miting and charged that- Smith was
at the time in the pay. of British
agents seeking to involve Crowley and
the consulate by leaving a trail of .
dynamite.

AMUSING EXPERIENCE
IS HAD BY ATTORNEY
OVER LOST BLANKET
Mexican Steals Navajo Blan
ket and Is Caught and Hires
Frank Doan to Defend Him
for Taking Doan's Blanket
Attorney Frank Doan of Douglas
was In the city yesterday on his way
to Tombstone, he stopped here long
enough to tell a good story on him
self. Several days ago some one stole
a Navajo blanket off of the clothes
line in his back yard. He reported
the matter to Deputy Sheriff Cross
and stated to him that he would give
the officer who caught the thief and
recovered the robe a $5 hat. A few
moments after he had mads this offer
Cross caught a man with the blanket
trying to sell it in one of the pawn
shops. The robe was identified by
Mr. Doan and the Mexican who had
it in his possession was locked up
charged with the theft. Soon after
this Mr. Doan was in his office and
a woman came in and gave him $10
to defend a Mexican who was under
arrest. He took the fee but was sur
prised to find out that he was defend
ing the Mexican who was accused of
taking the blanket. The Mexican
claimed that it was given to him by
another and this was the plea that
Doan put up to the judge but It was
of no avail, his client was convicted
and sentenced to serve 180 days on
the county road.
The amusing part of the transac
tion is that Doan is $5 to the good,
has recovered the blanket, and paid
Deputy Sheriff Cross his new hat.

Criticises the Police for Not
Catching Bootleggers and Is
Offered Chance to Catch
Them at Salary of $100.
Rev. Hubert L. Sparks, pastor of the
First Baptist church of Douglas, was
quoted as making the statement that
liquor was being sold in an open man
ner in that city. "We must either
l get rid of our bootleggers or of our
city police force," he said, according
j to the news article in question.

ment Monday night, when the motion
j of Alderman W. T. Boyd that Rev.
! Sparks and any member of his con
i gregation be might designate be em
j ployed as regular members of the city
police department with salaries fixed
at $100 per month was passed unau
j imously.
j An effort to notify Rev. Sparks of
: his appointment in order that he
might come down to the city hall and
be sworn in immediately, proved abor
tive. Chief of Tolice VV. S. Kirby said
that he stood ready to swear Rev.
Sparks in at any time and would
welcome his assistance in the difficult
work of keeping the city clean. He re
fused to express himself further on
the matter.
A number of the patrolmen are said
to be trembling in their several shoes
for fear Rev. Sparks will clean up
the city in such short order that their
services will be required no longer.

Final quotations proved to be al
most the lowest of the day, despite
estimates that new export business
amounts to fully 1 .000.000 bushels.
Actions of the British government in
withholding all information as to
prices at Liverpool tended to deter
speculative buying in Chicago. Bulls
were discentered to some extent by
the fact that reports concerning the
European visible supply seemed like
wise to have been suppressed.
Regardless of large sales of corn

stomacn trouuie.
Ten years ato a friend told me to trv
Thediord's Blitk-Uiauclit, which I did,
gnd I found it to be the best family medi

I keep Black-Draught on hand all (he
time now, and when my children feel a
little bad, they ask me for a dose, and it
does them more good than any medicine
they ever tried.
We never have a long spell of sick
ness in our family, since we commenced
using Black-Draught."
Thedford's Black-Draught fs purely
regetable, and has been found to regu

"PUBLIC OPINION" IS
THEMEFOR SCREEN
Blanche Sweet Plays Leading
Role in Good Photoplay :
at the Royal Today.
"Public Opinion," which appears at
the Royal today, Blanche Sweet's new
est photoplay for the Jesse L.Lasky
Feature Play Company, opens for the
screen an entirely new tbeme. In thi.
mefodrama of social conflict. Miss
Sweet appears as a young woman
nurse wrongfully accused of murder.
The hand of justice, unseen ' in the
very day world but ' visible in film,
stalks through the drama to the cli
max, finally pointing the way for the
freedom of. the accused and the convic
tion of the guilty.
In characters of this sort Miss
Sweet already occupies in 'the memo
ries tf motion picture enthusiasts a
unique place. Her remarkable per
formance in the dual personality in
"The Secret Sin" and again In the
Lasky-Belasco production "The Case
of Becky" mark her as one specially
suited for the portrayal of the occult.
Not the least distinguished feature
about "Public Opinion" is the manner
in which the story keeps entirely
away from the sordid.
New York Tribune asserts that Se
cretary Lansing will resign, McAdoo
will return to business in New York.
Baker will be shifted to department of
justice, Gregory will be appointed to
Court of Appeals, and Red held will re
sign. CMDSfAl
OH HER HANDS
Too III to Walk Upright Operation
Advised. Saved by Lydia E.
Piokham't Vegetable Compound.
This woman now raises chickens and
does manual labor. Read her story: -
Richmond, Ind. "For two years I
was bo sick : and weak with troubles
from my age that
when going up
stairs I had to go
very slowly with
my hands on the
steps, then sit down
at the top to rest.
The doctor said he
thought I should
have an operation,
and my friends
thought I would not
live to move into
our new house. My
daughter asked me
to try Lydia E. Pinkham'a Vegetable
Compound as she had taken it with good
results. I did so, my weakness dis
appeared, I gained in strength, moved
into our new home, did all kinds of
garden work, shoveled dirt, did build
ing and cement work, and raised hun
dreds of chickens and ducks. I can
not say enough in praise of Lydia E.
Pinkham'a Vegetable Compound and
if these facta are useful you may pub
lish them for the benefit of other
women." Mrs. M. O. Johnston, Route

GRANDMOTHER KNEW
There Was Nothing So Good for
Congestion and Colds
as Mustard
But tliC old-fashioned mustard-plaster
burned and blistered while it acted. You
can now get the re'ief and help that
mustard plasters gave, without tlie plas
ter and without the blister.
Mustcrole docs it. It is a clean,
white ointment, made with oil of
mustard. It is scientifically prepared,
so that it works wonders, and yet
does not blister the tendcrest skin.
Just massage Mustcrole in with the
finger tips gently. See how quickly
it brings relief how speedily the
pain disappears.
Use Musterole for sore throat, bron
chitis, tonsilitis, croup, stiff neck,
asthma, neuralgia, headache, conges
tion, pleurisy, rheumatism, lumbago,
pains and aches of back or joints,
sprains, sore muscles, bruises, chil

DR. CALDWELL'S SYRUP PEPSIN
EFFECTIVE AS A REMEDY
FOR CONSTIPATION.
Among oliler people the various or
gans of the b'jdy have a tendency to
slow up and weaken, and this is usual
ly first manifest in a pronounced in
activity of the bowels.
Good health Is dependent on regular
ity in this important function; when
ever there Is the slightest indication
of constipation a mild laxative should
be taken fj relieve the congestion and
dispose of the accumulated waste.
Cathartics or purgatives should not he
employed, however: they are too vio
lent In action and their effect Is only
temporary.
A mild laxative such as the com
bination of simple laxative herbs with
pepsin, knbwn as Dr. Caldwell's Syrup
Pepsin. Is the ideal remedy. It is
gentle in its action, bringing relief In
an easy, -natural manner, without grip

"MISTER 44" IS THE
ORPHEUM ATTRACTION
Excellent Metro Picture, Feat
uring May Allison and
Harold Lockwood.
"Mister 44," a Metro picture pro
duced by the Yorke Film Corporation,
with Harold Lockwood and May Alli
son in the steller roles, is the big fea
ture attraction at the Orpheum theatre
today. This is one of the finest pro
ductions in which these popular stars
have ever appeared, and it is one of
the most entertaining features ever re
leased on the Metro program. There
is a wealth of beautiful and wonder
fully picturesque mountain scenes,
w here much of the action takes place.
There are glimpses of city life in the
lactory district and among the slums,
while in striking contrast are scenes
enacted at an exclusive country club
in which scores of prominent society
tolk actually participated.
"Mister 44" is a story of distinctive
American romance, with a wholesome
and refreshing appeal. Mr. Lockwood
and Miss Allison have a distinguished
supporting cast which includes such
well known artists of the screen and
stage as Lester Cuneo, Franklin Hall,
l'onda Landowska, Aileen Allen, Belle
Hutchison, Lee Arms and Henry Otto.
Mr. Otto also directed the production,
rie also produced "The River of Ro
mance," in which Mr. Lockwood and
Miss Allison were starred by Metro.

O'BYRNE ARRESTED.
PHILADELPHIA, Jan. 9. Charged
A-ith aiding and abbetting Harry K.
Thaw in an alleged assault upon Fred
Jump, Jr. in New York and with at
.empted kidnapping, a man said to be
3eorge F. O'Byrne and described as
Thaw's body guard, was arrested at
a railroad station here as he was
about to leave the city. He was held
pending requisition from) the , New
i'ork authorities.
While admitting, according to the
letectives, that he is acquainted with
Thaw and that he had been with the
Pittsburger in this city until last nisht,
.he prisoner denied that he is O'Byrne
or that he is the man wanted in New
York. He declared that he had ab
solutely r.v kncv.ledse i-I t-c clr.es
jpon which he was taken into custody
and said that he had been with Thaw
only as a friend. - H said his name
was Oliver Brower, that he was a pitts-
burg salesman, and that he had known
Thaw for some time.
Barney Flood, the New York detec
tive, who assisted in making the ar
rest, however slated tonight that the
lescription he had of O'Byrne fits the
prisoner in all details and that he is
onvineed he is the man wanted. In
-.upp'jrt of this belief Flood said that
the police had found in the prisoner's
pocket a telesrani dated December 2H
from the authorities of Long Beach.

to act as a private bodyguard for the
Pittsburger while he was here, said
that Thaw had left the city last night
for Washington and that he intended
to leave the capitol tonight for Pitts
burg. Efforts to locate him so far
proved futile.

WHEN YOU WAKE
UP DRINK GLASS
OF HOT WATER
Wash the poisons and toxins from
system before putting more
food into stomach.
Says Inside-bathing makes any.
one look and feel clean,
sweet and refreshed.
l
Wash yourself on the inside before
breakfast like you do on the outside.
This is vastly more important because
the skin pores do r.tot absorb impuri
ties into the blood, causing illness,
while the bowel pores do.
For every ounce of food and dr'r.k
taken into the stomach, nearly an
aunce of waste material must
carried out of the body. If this wabte
.uateriai is not eliminated day by day
it quickly ferments and generates
poisons, gases and toxins which rre
absorbed or sucked into the olood
stream, through the'lymph duels which
should suck) only nourishment to sus
tain the body.
A splendid health measure is to
drink, before breakfast each day, a
glass of real Jiot water with a tea:
spoonful jf limestone p'loi-phate in it,
.vhich is a harmless way to wash
these poisons, gases and toxins from
the stomach, liver, kidneys and
bowels'; thus cleansing; sweetening
and freshening the entire alimentary
canal before putting more food into
the stomach.
A quarter pound of limestone phos
phate costs but very little at the drug
si'jre but is sufficient to make anyone
-in -enthusiast on inside-bathing. Men
and women who are accustomed to
wake up with a dull, aching head or
have furry tongue, bad taste, nasty
breath, sallow complexion, others who
have bilious attacks, acid stomach or
constipation are assured of pro
nounced improvement in both health
and appearance shortly.
