About Shipbuilding. j
Hy Review leased TVlrei i
LONDON. March 20. One of the i
most important statements made- to 1
the country recently wa the speech
deliered in the House of Commons to-!
dav by Sir Eric Campbell Geddes. first !
lord of the admiralty. He appeased j
the demand which has become general j
recently that the country should be j
told the exact amount of sbitipinc loss- j
es ami he also announced th! apnoinr- j
ment of Great Britain'3 foremost build- j
er. Lord Fierrie, as controller general
of merchant ship building. I
Lord Pierrie will not meiiiber !
of the board of the admiraiy but he i
will have direct access to the premier j
and the war cabinet. His appointment '
it is indicated, will be received withj
the greatest satisfaction. - ,
Sir Eric's speech was s. simple
statement of facts, with no oratorical !
sentences, but h2 was listened to more
atteniively than the most elo uent or- j
ators in thegov eranent.
Denies Hun Claim
Tin amount of tonnage sunk in the !
last ;welve months was 6,000.000, saiu
Sir Eric, instead of 9,500,000 as the
Gertunns claim. ,
The total allied and neutral tonmss
is now 42.000.00J. Sir Eric stated, the
fact that it is at this figure being
largely due to the new construction by .
the United States and th seizure of
Gorman ships. ' !
Tii; output of ne-.v tonnage, ecii'in
ved the first lord, was very low, in
1915, and reached its lowest point in
191!. This decline had been coincident
with the increased output of munitions '
and before the intensified submarine
war began Great Britain was 1.300,00.)
tons to the bad. During the last quar
ter of 1917, said Sir Eric, the allies
were averaging 100,0'tO tons monthly
of making their losses good and were
then replacing 73 per cent of their lost
tonnage.
Many New Yards
At the present time, the fifst lord
went on, forty-seven ship yards with
209 berths were engaged on ocean-going
merchant vessels. The ship yard
work-was completely disorganized dur
ir,g the first two years of the war from
various causes, he explained, but nev
ertheless there had been an enormous
accouplishment by the ship building
industry. The output for the last quar
tons as against
ter of 1917 was 420,000
213.000 tons for the last quarter of
1916, while during the last quarter of
1915 it had been only 42.000 tons.
When the controller of construction
took ever the ship yards there were
fifty large merchant ships in various
stages of construction upon which j
work had been stopped for lack of rf-1
ficient material or of labor, said the :
first lord, and in many cases they were
congesting the ship yards.
It was well within the capacity of
the- allied yards and even ot the Brit
ish yards. Sir Eric. declared, to make
good the world's losses if given an ad
equate supply of men and maaterial. i
In the fourth quarter of 1917 the for-'
eign construction was 512.000 tons, he
stated, giving a total output of 932.00J j

Nearly One Million Tons Added to Merchant Marine of Al
lies for Use, in Shipping Foodstuffs and Caring for Nether

(By Review Leased Wire.)
WASHINGTON, March 20. Upon Holland's refusal in the face of Ger
man threats, to put into effect her voluntary igrstment for restoring her
merchant mraine to normal activity, the United States government tonight
requisitioned all Dutch ships in American' waters. At the same time Great
Britain was taking over Dutch vessels in British ports.
A total of 77 ships of probably 600,000 tons was added to the American,
merchant marine by t'ne requisitioning. Another 400,000 tons are put into
the allied service by Great Britain's action.
Most of them will be used in the food carrying trade betwen the United
States and Europe.
President Wilson's proclamation taking over the ships was issued only
after word finally came from London that Holland's delayed reply was a re
jection of the British-American demand. The government waited more than
48 hours beyond th time when Holland had been requested to make a deci
sion as Jo whether she would carry out theoriginal pact or submit to requisi
tioning. Every effort was made to avoid drastic action, as transfer by agree
ment was sought, rather than by seizure, although the latter is an ixercise
of sovereign rights according to international law and practiced by all nations.
TO REIMBURSE OWNERS.
At 6 o'clock tonight it was disclosed that President Wilson during th
day had been informed of the delay in the Dutch reply, with the request that
he Indicate whether the requisitionirg should proceed. He decided to await
the formal reply, which proved unac--

od were l,200.0t) tons which were the J
lowest since the intensive sumnariue
war began. 1 , .
British Hardest H 'f -'
Groat Britain had lost on the aver
aceo f 26U.OOO tons monthly during
the last quarter of 1917 and had built
14n,mi tons monthly, the first lord an
nounced. British shipping had suffer
ed the most, he pointed out, but th
l?iitis"a had contributed the greatest
naval effort of the allies and had ens
taineJ the greatest attack, and should
not bemoan their scars. Sir Eric de
clared that the German statement of
the allies shipping losses for January
was an exaggeration of 113 percent.
Since he had shown up these grossly
false icturns for previous months, he
added, the German s'atement had not
been issued and was overdue?
Tue lirst lord s figures on the world
tonn.-ge w-(re reached after deducting
lake craft and a considerable amount
of small craft. His figures on the ton
nage sunk included vessels damaged
and ultimately abandoned. The fig
ures on losses Included those due both
to enemy action and marine risks.
Much P.epair Work
The output of repair work, contin
ued Sir Eric, had increased in Febru
ary. 1918. as compared with August,
J PIT. by j0 per cent; ten times more
navil crau were docked for repairs in
the last, quarter of last year than in
peao9 time, and more than 3,000 ships
were -dealt with in that period. The
men so employed might have produced
a half million tons of merchant ship
ping if they had been engaged in build
ing.
Tne three main factors in the build
ing problem, said the speaker, were,
first, patrols and other craft to de
stroy submarines"and safeguard ships
at sea, second, salvage and repair
work; third, the building of new mer
chant ships It would be simply pro
viding sheep for the butcher's knife to
put ail the industry's energies into the
building ol new ships he remarked.
Sir Eric admitted that the disap
pointing results for January and Febr
ruary building gave Justifiable cause
for anxiety, e denied the charge that
the admiralty was an ungenerous god
mother to merchant shipping. The
naval service he declared," had often
subordinated its interests to merchant
shipping. The drop in the curve of
merchant tonnage losses was attribut
ed by the speaker mainly to the effi
ciency of the patrol and anti-submarine,
craft and to the valuable convov
work of other vessels.
Output Is Inci eased
The great effort in construction and
repaii work had been made, the first
lord pointed out, concurrently with the
enormouF increase in the output of mu
nitions. The output of guns and am
munition in 1917 was nearly double
that of the previous year and the out
put of airplanes was two and one half
times as large, while arrangements
were in progress during 1917 provid
ing lor great increases this year.
The first lord defended the shipping
controller and the admiralty against
charges that ship building had been
delayed by chants in designs of. ships
on the stocks. The reasons for the
changes were, he said, to secure in
creased speed that submarine attacks
might be evaded, to secure greater
comfort for the crews, to simplify the
designs, to convert ships into oil tank
ers and to provide additional heavy
gun mounting.
Shortage of Material
The yards had suffered from a short- i
age of material during the summer I
months of 1917, he admitted, but today I
the material position was satisfactory j
anu me mocks m tne yarns were more
satisfactory than for years. The need
today was for skilled labor. He hoped J
within a lew weeks it would be for un
skilled label only
Tns delay in the oirtput for Januarv
and February was largely due to re
pairs and the conversion of ships into
oil talkers, which class the Germans
hnd set themselves to sink. The net
audition to lanor in the last seven
months had been
unskilled.

TOMORROW USHERS in the new Spring models and accessories. Never be
fore has such a splendid array of THE NEWEST fashiens been presented in this
town.
, THE Oriental note strongly dominates the Spring Fashions, except where
military makes itself felt, as in the Scotch Plaids and the cap-like small hats and
military lon,g coats.
SOFT tones cf rose, old blue, dull green and leaf brewn will be the rule. Chinese
blue is particularly good C3 it was this winter, then there are the new grays, tans and
the. ever popular navy and black.
ELABORATE drapr d gowns of 30ft silk, or silk and net. are being shown for aft
ernoon' wear. A very goc d cotton season is before us, featuring ginghams and voile3
in plaids, figures and foulard designs. N
HATS ARE BOTH small and large, but the former are the most popular and are
distinguished by eccentricity of line and tri-imir.. Lustrous straws and tailor-made
trimmings are the thing, f 'owers being rather small or elsn used rather sparingly.
SKIRTS measure in many instances less than two yards and the shoe top length
stays with us.
UNDERWEAR sho'v-s a tendency to be much closer fifted and the knickerbock
ers and paiamas have found popular favor. '
THE Eton Jacket ha returned and all short coats arc to be fashionable. Also the
sleeveless Sport Jacket in velvet or silk is one of the most decided new features.

the really spectacular plays of the
past few months, will be the offering
at the Orpheum theatre tonight. In

In the masnificient special produc-l

is dramatized. When the men at the
front di.'paired of victory and laid ,
down their arms, a noble band of wo-;
men. the "Battalion of Death." toos
their pieces in the trenches and fought 1
the Huns. This great story by June
Mathls. "The Lesion of Death," im
mortalizes this moment and shows the
scenes of rejoicing when Russia threw
off the yoke of the Czar. The superb
actress, Edith Storcv. plays the part.
of the Princeff Marya. who leads tne
women warriors into battle. The part
calls for dwmatic fire, and Miss Stcrev
rises to great heights in it. "The Leg
ion of Death" is a production long to
be remembered.

War's Curse and Blessings
What has been the most striking effect
of the war upon the United States? The
pacifist would answer that it has cost us
billions in money and will cost us thou
sands of lives, and this sacrifice all for noth
ing. The traitor and disloyalist would
answer that we went to war with Germany
' without cause. But the average American
citizen, after some study of many printed
pages upon the war, and after some thought
would answer that the war has not, so far,
been an unmixed curse to this nation.
He would answer that the sacrifices have
not been in vain. The war found this na
tion mad in the pursuit of the dollar ; found
it fat and lazy and rich. Found it waste
ful. Found it indifferent to any future ex
cept the squandering of its own great re
sources. He would answer that his nation
has gone into training for speed, strength
and endurance. That it changed from ex
travagance to close economy. That it has
thrown off its shameful garments of dloth
and selfishness to put on the shining rai
ment of hard work and sacrifice. That this
war i3 a furnace from which this republic
will emerge pure gold, leaving the dross and
slag and worthless elements behind in the
ashes.
These gains are only in ideata and in sent
iment and in spirit, argues the materialist.
Well, there have been material gains, too.
The war has brought to America the most
marvelous expansion of her banking power
ever known to the world before; it has
changed her from a debtor to a creditor na
tion; it has brought both a sensational and
tremendous development of her foreign
commerce and the creation of a merchantile
marine that will pour a golden stream into
her lap for years to come; it has engender
ed an all important and long needed chemi
cal industry that will result in more bene
fits than the pen can set down; it has
doubled our metal industries and metal
values; it has increased our agricultural
products from values of fourteen millions
to twenty-one millions.
Yes, and there is another and distinctive
material advantage from the war. It has
called hundreds of thousands of young men
from every walk in life and subjected them
to severe training and discipline, thus mak
ing them more manly and resourceful and
valuable to their kin and country for years
to come. It has called hundreds of thou
sands of men to learn skilled trades. It has
called thousands of women from the ex
treme of ease and the extreme of toil to do
a noble work, and not one of these but that
will be more useful to society as a result.
No, this war is not an unmixed curse. No
great work, toil or sacrifice is ever a curse
unmixed with blessings. Men must die and
women must weep when nations war, but
out of the red gleam of the battle and the
pain of the hospital's narrow walls and the
rivers of tears will come a finer, stronger,
truer race and another tier of solid rock
foundations upon which the pillars of this
republic may rest in both honor and pride
as well as mere security in the years yet tt
come.
Weigh them well; the pacifist's pitiful
plea, and the patriot's deathless glory.
' Which will you have for a heritage ?

many's explanations do not explain. To
cut a man's throat cannot be compensated
by a click of the heels and a polite phrase.
Pro-German talk has been too dangerously
like the following:
At recess, playing in the yard,
Willie strangled Susie hard;
Suisie died in dreadful pain.
Said teacher, "Don't do that again.'
Willie killed his baby sister ;
After while the teacher missed her.
Sister, dying, made some noise,
Teacher said, "Boys will be boys."
Governmental authorities of both Eng
land and Scotland have notified the English
premier that Australian soldiers are marry
ing English and Scotch girls at the rate cf
eight hundred a month and ask the premier
if the British government will furnish trans
portation for these wives to Australia after
the war. It is confidently expected that the
government will gladly do this little thing
for the brave Anzacs who have fought so
well for oldvEngland. It is also declared
that the Australians have a decided partiali
ty for the Scotch lassies over their English
sisters. Well, why not? "Her face it is
the fairest that ever . the sun shone on,"
goes the old song about Annie Laurie, the
Scotch maid of Maxwelton. Bonny and
brave and sensible and true are the girls of
Scotland, if one may believe in the old
songs and great stories of that land. And
he who does not believe is a misfit in the
grand scheme of things. They are a long
headed lot, those Australians who would
pick Scotch girls to adorn their far off
homes in the Antipodes. And they have
working as well as winning ways. There
is no better blood in the wide world than
Scotch blood, and it is not her old heroes
and kings and professors and mechanics
and shipbuilders that have alone furnished
all the light for Scotland's glory, her won
derful lassies lighted most of these lamps
that will never grow dim. The Australian
soldiers who take Scotch brides back to the
other side of the world with th
sing with Harry Lauder :
"I love a lassie, bonny, bonny lassie, -And
she's purer than the lilies in the dell:
She's sweeter than the heather,
The bonny, bonny heather,
Mary, my Scotch bluebell."

On the first page of a great newspaper
of the southwest yesterday appeared, alcng
with the big black headlines about ;he
Flanders fighting and the sinking of sub
marines and the making of shells and Ine
finesse of diplomats quarreling over lad
that has been conquered and land that is to
be restored, a three column heading in type
just as large and just as black the announce
ment that it is Time to put out roses and
trees.." This line was like a flower in a bat
tle field; it was a soft breath to blow away
the smoke and a soft hand upon a wounded
soldier's brow. By all means let the citi
zens of the southwest set out some roses.
Nowhere in the world do they grow more
beautiful than in this clime. So, along with
our war gardens and our shipments cf cop
per and our response to the second draft
and our Red Cross bandages and our thrift
stamps and our wheatless days and our un
swerving determination to fight to a finish,
let U3 put out a few roses. It is necessary
to plant grain and dig copper in order to
live, but the rose, queen of flowers, is an
extra", it pays its way with its fragrance
and its beauty. .In the midst of war let us
have more roses so that we may be worthy
to win and be great and merciful in victory.
Here is a strange and fantastic irony up
on the fateful trend of the world war. Rus
sia, the firat nation to mobilize against Ger
many, in defense of little Rumania, and by
that act drag her allies into the war, was
the first and only nation to quit cold and
desert these same allies. And now Ger
many, having seized the fairest portions of
Russia and all her important sea ports and
lands adjacent thereto, offers the allies all
they are fighting for in the west if they will
ratify the dismembership 'and slavery of
this same Russia. And the allies say, "No!" .
This comes of having a conscience and a
cause, both high above mere personal ad
vantage and material gain.

A special writer from Washington to one
of the New York dailies declares that the
final collapse of Russia, the evidence that
Cermany is bent on conquest wherever
possible, the knowledge that Austria-Hungary
was using diplomatic camouflage in
expressing sentiments that appeared to be
at varience with Germany's desire to rule
the world, the veiled threats of the Prus
sion autocracy to the Scandinavian nations,
have brought to Washington a full realiza-.
tion that the future of democratic institu
tions depends upon the sword, and not on
peace by understanding with Germany on
the other side of the peace table. "We have
been going on the principle of 'Live and
Let Live," " said one of the foremost men of
the government. "From now on we are
going on. the principle of 'Live or Die.' "
Lenine, the Russian, or rather, the Bol
sheviki, premier, signed the Brest-Litovsk
peace treaty and then in the next hour de
clared that he did not expect to keep it.

WITH THE AMERICAN ARMY IN
FRANCE. March 20 (By the As
sociated Press) The first division oi
the (American expeditionary forces
to arrive in France was addressed by
Secretary of War Baker today .
"It would seem more fit," said the
.secretary, "and I would much prefer.
instead of addressing you, to listen
to your experiences. Your division
has the distinction of being the first
to arrive in France. May every man
in your ranks aim to 'mak the first
division the first In accomplishment.
With you came a body of marines,
tl'.ose well disciplined ship shape sol
diers of the navy.
"When your division arrived. It was
regular' In name, judged by the high,
standard set by our regular army.
Some sixty per cent of the privates j
were recruits and even a larger per-i
tentage of the otficrs came from the j
reserves. Had .we chosen we could ,
have sent to France at the outset a j
veteran regular contingent While j
this might have bean a source of mo-1
mentary fratification it was contrary
to the long view vl our responsibility j
in giving adequate military - assist j
ance to the allies and out of keeping j
with the broad plan of our staff to use
our professional soldiers of all grades
in training a large army which should j
have units of even quality of efriciency ;
in order to assure dependability upon j
all parts, which is a requisite to-, sue-j
cessful action. j
"Yours was the first experience in ;
being billeted and in all the initial ;
cetiils of adjusting yourselves to the
new and strange conditions. In this, ,
as in developing a system of training,
you were ths pioneers blazing the ;
way, waich succeeding contingents i
could profit by your mistakes. j
"L'ay after day and week after .
week you had to continue the hard
drudgery of instruction which Is ne-,
cessary to proficiency in modern!
war. You had to restrain your impa-i
tie nee to go Into the trenches under j
Geneial Pershing's wise demand for'
that thoroughness, the value of which ;
you now appreciate as a result of ac
tual service In the trenches." j
.Secretary Eaker had his baptisms

a German shell burst within less than !
fifty yards of his motor car. He was,
notl njured. , j
The secretary went into the:
trenches in a sector where American
troops face the enemy nearby. The
Germans maintained an active fire
with heavy pieces and machine gun.
Nevertheless, ' Mr. Baker made his
way to an advanced sap, entered and

The United States and her assist
ants in the war have come into ap-l
proximately one million tons of much
nedetf shipping which to aid in
;rosecutinR the war against the Teu
tonic allies. !
Having bwn unsuccessful In r-
o tinj; arrangements with The Neth
erlands government for he taking;
over of Dutch vessels lying the Amerl-i
can and albed ports, the United States
.mi Creat Hriiatn have ordered all
such venseU seiwd in accordance wilii
international Ihw and out into serv-.
ce for the benefit of the allies. j
Holland, 'n the face of Gejniiiii
threats and intimidations, lung Imd
hesitated voluntarily to relinquish the
desired iiierc-Vant marine and nothing
remained hut fcr the felted States
and Great Britain to act within their
soverign rights and seize the ships,
full compensation for the use of dea-(
truction whi'-h Is to be given. '
Expect New Sub Attacks.
Not alone will the owners of the
vessels, many of which have lain idle
for months, now begin acain to derive
revenue from them, but all the peo
ple of Holland will benefit by the
seizures, inasmuch as the country will
be permitted to receive ample food
stuffs from abroad and alfo be pro
terted in carrying out her colonial
trade.
As a result of t'.e action of the
American and British governments
Germany now may be expected to le
gin a ne.igtened campaign of frightful
ness with her I'-boats which doubtless
will be met by a more intensive pro
gram f defense against sinkings on
the part of ilfo all'cs.
All along Hie western front, tiie ac

(By Review Leased TVIre)
LONDON, March 20. In a general
reply to criticisms raised In the debate
Premier Lloyd George said that snip
building haU not been stopped for lack
of steel or steel plates. The difficulty
had been largely one of labor. - Every
man in the home service skilled in
ship luilding had already been taken
from the army, but when it was de
manded that twenty thousand men
should be withdrawn forcibly from
the field operations a very serious re
sponsibility was involved. Many of
these men were essential to manning
batteries and were the mainstay of
complete organizations.
-We cannot take the risk of destroy
ing ihe efficiency of the army in the
field at a very critical and perilous
moment,' added the premier, "where
the skill of these men is essential to
the successful conduct of particular op
erations.
The government believed, continued
the i iemier, that by special exertion
the deficiency of 120,000 tons monthly
in British shipping could be made
good, thereby making it impossible for
the enemy, who wasu nable to defeat
the allies in tlw field, to defeat them
by. the process of destroying their
trad?.
"This woud do more to shorten t.'ie
war than any individual effort the
country cuuld put forward," said the
premier, "because it .would bring home
id ttii enemy that however long he
went on with the war he would never
be able to defeat us."
Ex-Pr?uiier Asquith, welcoming the
publication of the shipping output and
the losses, said that so far from dis
quieting the country or giving infor
mation to the enemy, it would have
the best possible efort in regularizing
the position and enabling th country
to face the facts without panic or
suspicion. Mr. Asquith made the in
teresting revelation that Admiral Sir
Jo:.n Jellicoe had been removed from
'command of the grand fleet at his
own request with the express object
of dealing with the submarine men

Permanent Results
I believe every man ought to learn all that he can. When any portion
of the knowledge acquired proves to be of unusual benefit in his own case,
I consider it his duty to advise other persons of that fact, especially so.
when his own experience is confirmed by the experience of many others,
similarly situated.
For these reasons, I wish tc make a statement which I am certain will
prove valuable to these who may see fit to act upon the information of
fered. I have lived In this camp for something over a year, .having been
called here to Uke pastoral charge of the Christian church. For about
ten years bofore coming here. I had suffered almost continuously from
serious stomach trouble, due, as physicians said, to too much acid. At
times, the burning sensationr were hardly endurable. Jn addition to tills.
I was rarely free Irom rheumatic pains thru my shoulders and the back
of niy.neck.
It seems to be natural for one to refer to liis own afflictions, and in
speaking cf these with different ones on the streets in Bisbee, 1 was very
often recommended to take a course of Vitolox. These recommendations
were so frequent and persistent, that I finally decided to give it a trial.
I took a course of three bottles. That was about eight months ago. Those
'unpleasant symptoms which annoyed me so long disappeared entirely and
have not been felt for several months.
I like fair play and aim at all times to cive credit where credit is
due. As this remedy. Vitolox. is made erc in Bisbee, I went to the man
ufacturer and tcld him what it had done for me and expressed a deire
to make a statement for publiration. He requested me to ixistpone the
matter until time had proved the results to. be permanent. That seemed
so rea.-onable that I have thought more of the medicine and t.'ie man. too,
ever since.
While I am leaving Itisbee for another field of service. I want to leave
this statement for the pood it may no others here and elsewhere.
