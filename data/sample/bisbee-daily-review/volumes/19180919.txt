OF GERMANY, SENT TO AID
BULGARS, TO RETREAT
UNDATED WAR LEAD, (By
the Associated Press). British
and French veterans have made
another successful smash at the
HincXinburg line. Sweeping for
ward on a front of 22 miles, they
went ahead from one and one-third
to three miles, taking many pris
oners. The most important aspect
of the advance is that it makes
more certain the capture of St.
Quentin, which the Germans have
been ordered to hold at all costs.
This important city is virtually
surrounded on three sides and its
fall seems only a matter of days..
Field Marshal Haig's third and
fourth armies charged over the
trench system occupied by the
British before they were pushed
back by the Teutonic flood- last
March. They captured, in wide
sectors, the outer defenses of the
Hindenburg line.
The British assault was over a front
of sixteen miles from Holnon, west
of St. (fuentin, td Gouzcacourt, north
of Fpf.'iy. In their advance which
readied a. .depth of more than three
miles at some points, they took more
than" 6000 prisoners.
Not only did the blow bring nearer
the capture of St. Quentin, which the
Germans are struggling desperately to
hold, but it went far towards wiping
out the only bulge in the British line
which resembles a salient. Epehy at
the apex of t'.ie bend, has been taken
anud the same fate has befallen Gouz
cacourt and Hargicourt which stood at
the ends of the wing.
The importance which the Germans
attach to the territory wrested from
them is indicated by the announce
ment that they launched determined
counter attacks as soon as they could
he organized, from Hargicourt to the
Omfgnon rivulet.
The success of their efforts remains,
somewhat obscure, but it is not be
lieved they can recover the ground
they have lost.
While the French advance was less
spectacular than that of the British
with whom they co-operated, they
were equally successful in gaining
their objectives. They moved forward
on a front of six miles to an average
depth of one and one-Uiird miles, add
ing several hundred prisoners to the
I'ritish bag. They now hold the south
ern outskirts of Contescourt, less than
three miles from the suburbs of St.
Quentin.
This city, where the troops of Von
Goeben scored a great victory in 1S71
is one of the buttresses of the Douai-Cambrai-St..Qunetin-La
Fere-Laon line
behind which it has been announced
the Germans would not fall back.
With the French in the outskirts
of La Fere, with St. Quentin invested
and with the British battling dogged
ly for Cambrai, the great Hindenburg
defense system is in danger of being
breached at three of its strongest
points. Once ousted from it the Teu
tons will have' back of them no strong
fortifications until they reach the
Maubeuge defenses.
Taking of St. Quentin remains a
difficult task, however, for the Ger
mans are in strong defensive posi
tions and a captured order from Gen
eral Von Margen to the fourteenth re
serve corps emphasized the import
ance of the terrain they hold. He or

ONSLAUGHT OF OUR MEN
WITH THE BRITISH ARMY
IN FRANCE, Sept. TS (By The
Associated Press.) The British
troops made a. powerful attack
against the German lines to the
wst and northwest of. St. Quen
tin today, and most important re
sults were achieved. A deep ad
vance into the enemy territory
strengthened the already powerful
grip the British have on St. Quen
tin. one of the mo;;t strongly fortl
fic.l parts of the Hindenburg line.
To the south the French co
operated in whit is likely to prove'
an operation of vast portent, with
re-ipect to the Hindenburg defen
sive pofitlon. '
The zone in volved in the British
movement lay, roughly, between Hol
non, on the south, and Gouzaeaucourt.
Within a few hours Peizlere, Temp-leux-Le-Guerard,
Epehy, Ronssoy and
Vi'leret V( re behind the advance
British forces, and bitter fighting was
'n progress at many other points in
the forward zone. More than 3.000
nrisoners have already been sent to
the cages.
That hard fighting would be en
countered in this sector was a fore
gone cr.nelusion. The main enemy op
position came from machine guns and
artllU-ry. The counter barrage which
the Germans sent over in reply to the
British bombardment was much more
severe than the enemy had been able
to provide in the recent fighting, and,
as an additional new feature, the Ger
mans maintained a heavy barrage over
the back areas with high velocity
guns, which they had concentrated for
the purpose.
The shelling of the back areas dur
ing an attack is to be expected, but a
barrage has seldom before been at
tempted, and then without great suc
cess. The German infantry surrendered
quite frequently in places. In fact. In
the center of the attack, where the
Australians were working, a consider
able number of gray coats deliberately
charged through the barrage to give
themselves up.
Todey's operation cannot be con
sidered as a major operation, as com
xsred with recent battles. The ob
jectives sought, however, were impor
tant, both from -the defensive and of
fensive standpoint. The assault be
gan at dawn. Unfortunately rain be
gan to fall about 2 o'clock, and when
the British went over the top the
ground was already slimy and bard to
negotiate, especially when the ridges
wr reathed and the men had ta
charge up them. Tanks accompanied
the troops and rendered invaluable
service in the early stages of the con-
fid, which waxed warm from the!
start. j
T1k British preliminary bombard-1
ment was brief and was followed by !
the customary barrage for the protec
tion of the advancing infantry. The
Germans immediately replied with a
vicious fire from large numbers of
guns concentrated behind the St.
Quentin canal.

Peace Made by Her Serf
Kingdom
(Fly Review I'h.- Wire)
WASHINGTON. Sept. IS. German
disclaimers of knowledge of Austria's
intention to despatch her proposal for
non-binding discussions of peace are
being made in the face of information
in possession of the American govern
ment that the German government
was fully aware of its ally's purpose.
It is not known that Germany gavei
her specific approval to t.'ie Austrian
move, but officials are satisfied that
if approval was withheld it was sole
ly for the reason that a doubt was en
tertained as to the success of the un
dertaking. That-the German government was in
full sympathy with the Austrian pur
pose is regarded as established from
the record. Officials today called at
tention to the fact that this latest pro
posal was really nothing more than an
elaboration in many words of one of
the Initial peace efforts launched by
both Germany and Austria. December
12, 191C. On that date not only Ger

them to transmit this overture to the

case, the special interest of the pope
was solicited and 'the neutrl states

It was said at the state department

"I must say frankly that I have not

Responsibility for Good Service
IT IS tremendously important in these days of stress that the public be
given food telephone service. It is vital to the Government's prog
ress. The responsibility for telephone facilities rests with the company; but
the public has a partnership in the responsibility for good telephone service.
There are three human factors involved in a telephone call, represented
by the person calling, the operator and the person called. The quality of the
service depends upon the cooperation of all three.
The operator can make the connection but no words can be heard at one
end of the line if they are not properly spoken into the transmitter at the
other end of the line ; if they are not spoken distinctly to ..itantive listener.
The public can serve the service by answering promptly, speaking dis- .
tinctly into the transmitter, and listening attentively.

Merely Confirmed
More than a few misguided or thought
less people in the allied nations had held out
against all the evidence and all the testi
mony of word and deed and believed still
that Lenin and Trotzky and their unspeak
able following might have acted from mot
ives of patriotism at the beginning of their
career of crimes and dishonor and all along
had been honest in their betrayal of Russia
to the Prussian by disbanding its armies.
But now at last the unassailable proof is
that they acted as paid German agents from
the very beginning and that their system of
betrayal of their own country and opposi
tion to all the aims of all the allies was com
plete, thorough, skillful and German con
trolled at every step along the way. This
column has always contended that such
was the case and has had more than one
argument, bitter and otherwise, on the sub
ject. Neither Trotzky or Lenin had any- "
thing but a certain low cunning with which
to cover their tracks. Their every move
was calculated to help Germany. Their
course in this respect was too consistent
and too determined and too regular to indi
cate anything but a devoted partisanship to
Berlin. This column has always contended
that whatever price Germany paid fhese
two agitators and conspirators, it was too
little, considering their service to the kaiser
and his staff. They still hold tenaciously
to their place in charge of what little affairs
and government of Russia been left
from the wreck, ruin, storm and. plague'.
And they can be depended upon to hold out
to the end. Germany's agents are always
as resolute as they are unscrupulous. The
Russian situation will remain hepeless un
til Czecho-Slav, and allied bayonets drive
Lenin and Trotzky and their cut throats
and plunderers and German masters away
or kill or imprison them. Depend upon it,
Lenin and Trotzky :have received their
thirty pieces of silver from the high priests
at Berlin and they will give Russia over to
German crucifixion unless they are staid by
the allied sword.
A lady subscriber sends the editor of the
Review an exceedingly well written and
courteous letter in which she quotes from
the scriptures to support her theory that the
Lord was against Sutter in the recent pri
mary campaign. Now this column could
be ungallant enough to retort that "the devil
can quote scripture," but that is hardly the
proper way to acknowledge such a polite
epistle. And anyway this column holds no
brief for Senator Sutter. It does not feel
called upon to continue to stir up class and
political strife by explaining his defeat. It
supported him simply because it considered
him the ablest and most forceful man in the
race and because it believed his election
would be more beneficial to Arizona as a
whole than that of any of his competitors.
In reply to the lady subscriber this column
would say that it is both surprised and sor
ry to note one of her apparent intelligenc-2
and her fair minded manner of address in
voking the scriptures to aid her in support
of such a cause. As between the principles
represented by Sutter and by Colter in the
recent primary, this column is firm in its
belief that both the major and the minor
Jprcphets and all of the apostles except
Judas would be on the side of Sutter, and
this column turns not a little to the scrip
tures itself in search of both comfort and
support.
I och has, it is now estimated by those in
position to know, just one million Ameri
can soldiers at his hand ready to use for
any blow he elects to strike this coming fall.
Hie figures show that seven regular, -twelve
national guard and fourteen national draft
army divisions are at his disposal for front
line service And besides these arc more
than a half million of newly landed troops
and diivers and workmen and cooks and
other non-corr.batants necessary to a mod
ern army behind the lines. Four army
corps and two divisions organized and
ready to strike. A million armed men! It
is a wonderful record for America for the
year. Go ahead, Ferdinand, any time
you're ready.
German Morale
All this talk of loss of German morale
makes this column tired. There is abso
lutely nothing to bear it out, that is, nothing
that is real and tangible. Only results, and
not theories, count in war. The actual
facts show that the German soldiers are
fighting almost as well as ever. Anyway,
they have succeeded in stopping and hold
ing Foch's offensive dead in its tracks for
a week past with the allied soldiers still a
fraction short of their real objectives of
Douai, Cambrai, St. Quentin, La Fere,
Laon and Lens. That the allies Will even
tually take every one of these pillars and
bastions of the Hindenburg line is as cer
tain as that the dawn follows the darkness.
But it now appears that they will have to
fight hard for them. This folly that counts'
upon broken German morale to give them
up after weak resistance is well calculated
to under estimate the achievements of our
troops at the front and to overestimate
what we have done to equip our battle
lines and supply them with the manpower
and ammunition necessary to break
through. The plain facts are, that our real
fighting and our real fruits of victory lie
just ahead of the allied line3. Not until we
can take Cambrai and St. Quentin will we
be able to drive the Hun from the Hinden
burg line and force him either to spend the
winter in the open or fall back to the Meuse.
Our winter quarters are yet to take. And
just how hard that job will be is shown by
the taking of Noyon a few weeks ago. The
German troops, after having suffered five
weeks of defeat, held that town to, the last
man against a division that is the pick and
flower of the French armies. It was a
division that had been cited eight times for
valor and had won three, legion of honor
crosses for its flags at Verdun, on the Som
me and in the Champagne battles. This di-
vision surrounded the town on three sides
and from this semi-circle advanced for the
final blow,' The Germans fought from
street to street and from house to house,
and they even resisted after being bayonet
ed and had to be given the butt as they lay
on the ground. No quarter asked or given
was the rule at Noyon.. And yet these
"bear" stories about brokenGerman mor
ale continue to be printed and told and be
lieved. The German morale is not what
it was. The Prussian pride has had an
awful blow lately. The German defeats
have been so many as to become monoton
ous during the past two months, but there
is nothing to indicate that the German
troops at the battle front will not still fight
desperately and well for'some time to come.
Both Bulgarian and Austrian troops have
been noted on the western front. And so
it was that Foch ordered a blow on the
Salonica front from whence they were
drawn. The stroke landed with crushing
effect and its result may well make Aus
tria and Bulgaria pause to consider before
they send more cannon fodder into the in
satiate maw of that western front. And by
the waj the Austrian troops got a taste of
American steel at St. Mihiel the other
day. Wonder if they will send a testimon
ial to those German military critics who an
nounced so blatantly and confidently that
the Americans could not fight.
Those Bolsheviki societies they started to
form in America, and their sympathizers
and well wishers and defenders, what has
become of them? And how do they feel
about it since the exposure of the shame
and real motives of these cheap and ruth
less traitors has been submitted with abund
ant proofs to the world? The Bolsheviki
pay roll was audited and paid from Berlin,
and every one who had observed closely
the activities of this organization had
known it for a long time.
Prescott Courier: The Printers' Bulletin
says 1 000 country newspapers went out of
business last year and that 1 000 more wili
go out this year. Probably half went otit
because of poor collections and the increas
ed cost of production, the other half because
of the effort always in evidence to start
newspapers where no field exists without
killing off some paper already in the field
and the increased cost of production.
Dallas News: Personally wr arc in favor
of taxing heavily every newspaper that has
an excess of war-prophets.
PYTHIAN SISTERS
THANKFUL FOR BIG
HELP OF PUBLIC
iC. & A. BAND DOES GRACEFUL
ACT BY DONATING ITS PART OF
RECEIPTS BACK TO FUND FOR
AMBULANCES FOR COUNTIES
OF THIS STATE
The dance Riven by the Pythian sis
ters of the Lily Temple, Tuesday night
at the Warren park for the benefit of
the ambulance fund was a grand suc
cess. .The Pythian sisters wish to
thank the public for its generous pat
ronage and willing response to the
noble cause for which they had work
ed and in assisting them in every way
in order that the dance might be a
success.
The proceeds of this dance will go
toward the $0650 ambulance fund.
These ambulances are to be purchas
ed and named after the fourteen coun
ties of the state and will be sent to
France at once by the Pythian sis
ters of Arizona, through the Keil
Cross association, equipped and redy
for service on the battlefield. The
material and labor for preparing these
ambulances will be furnished by the
Pythian sisters. Word has been re
ceived. Trom nearly all of the Temples
of the state wiiich shows that at pres-
; ent there is sufficient money on hand
to purchase and equip twelve ambu
lances. Those who have not yet sent
In the returns of their amount for
this fund state that they are Still
working and adding more to the
amount which they already have.
There is no dcubt that when all the
temples have sent In their returns
there will bo a fund large enough- to
purchase the entire number of ambu
lances. Since there are a few counties in
the state that have not an organized
Temple, and the fact that there ore in
some counties two organizations, the
over amount in the ambulance fund
of these organizations will be turned
over to the county lacking an organ
ized Temple and by doing this an am-
Ubulance will be sent to France from
each county in t.'ie state. The pro

GADSDEN HOTEL IS
RAIDED BYDFFICERS
Sensation and scandal reigned
throughout Douglas late Monday night
and yesterday morning, when the re
port became common gossip upon the
streets that the Hotel Gadsden had
undergone two raids by the police in
less than four hours.
The raids were the culmination of
numerous reports reaehing the head of
the police department within the past
t-AO weeks to the effect that much
drunkenness and disorderly conduct
was rampant in tho hotel, and that
"booze parties" were being held
nfehtly throughout the establishment.
After carefully investigating the re
ports. Chief of Police Jones, assisted
by Patrolmen Kirkpatrick, Ross and
Boozer, swooped down upon the Gads
den twice within four hours Monday
night, and as a r'sult the police drag
net closed in on the following:
F. J. I.angan, manager of the Gads
den, charged witb being drunk and
having whisky in his possession. He
nrido the required bond and was re
leased. R. V. Kelley, charted with having
whiskv in his possession.
M. L. Burkley, charged with being
drunk and disorderly, and now being
held in jail by Chief Jones for im
personating himself as a federal of
ficer. II. S. Percival, charged with being
drunk.
J. H. Welch, also placed under ar
rect for being druuk and being unable
to make bail, was compelled to spend
the rest of the night in jail.
Welch was later fined $25 'and the
charge of impersonating an officer
against Buckley was dismissed. He
was fined for being drunk, as were
the others arrested.

FIVE
WJHRBI DISTRICT TIES STEPS
TO PROTECT INTERESTS IN THE
. COURT HOUSE REMOVAL HATTER
Residents of the Warren district in
terested in the progress and well be
ing of their community, have been
invited to attend a meeting at the Bis
bee City park Friday evening next at
8 o'clock, when the county seat re
moval question will be discussed and
considered. The Warren district has
been forced to take a hand in the pro
posed court house removal through
the activities of Douglas, and tho
Warren District Commercial club, act
ing in conjunction with the mayor and
city council; have called the meeting.
At the meeting a permanent organi
zation for the prosecution of the work
will be perfected, plans to be follow
ed will be outlined, propoed sites for
the court house will be discussed in
Bisbee, Lowell and Warren, and other
matters will be taken up. A speaker
to explain the status of the question
at present and to explain the legal
questions involved will preside at the
meeting, but the discussion will be
general and everyone will be request
ed to give ideas and Join in the or
ganization work.
Following is a brief statement of the
history of the case by C. W. Allen,
president of the Commercial club, and
chairman of the club's committee
working in co-operation with the may
or and city council.
"A year ago last spring Douglas
started a movement to change the lo
cation of the county seat under the
county seat removal law of our state
statute. A committee from Douglas
came to Bisbee to confer with the
Warren District Commercial club, ask
ing co-operation to secure the county
seat for the Smelter City. Under the
very unsettled conditions the Warren
District club did not consider the
time opportune for the removal of
the county seat or for the agitation
of the matter and discouraged the
project as best it could. However, a
committee was named and was par
tially successful in securing a site for
this district in order that it mignt
not be caught wholly asleep. The
matter was then temporarily dropped
as far as Bisbee was concerned.
"Douglas in the meantime, disre
garded Bisbee's admonitions that the
time is inopportune, went ahead, is
sued and secured signatures for peti
tions to bring the question up at the
election and carried out a complete
program and campaign agitating coun
ty seat removal throughout the coun
ty. It is understood they have three
sites selected for submission and
there is a feeling about the county
that unless the Warren district acts.
Douglas will possibly secure the coun
ty seat. ' Indications of today are that
the county seat will be removed,
through the activity of Douglas. The
Warren district has a better chance
to get it than Douglas.
"We have been forced into the
fight, but through fairness to the peo
ple of the northern part of the coun
ty and of this district, the Commercial
club has decided that the voters shall
have an opportunity of designating I
this district as one of the proposed ,
sites and of voting on this district's,
proposed site. We wish it to ie;
known that the Warren District club
would not have taken a hand in the '
matter had it not been forced to do j
so, and that now that we have taken
an interest in the matter it is in the
interest of the people of his district,
to assure them an opportunity of ex
pressing themselves as to the loca
tion of the new county seat and coun
ty buildings. The Warren District
has not antagonized the northern part
of the county In this fight and be
cause of thiB attitude will secure
much support from these voting pre-
cincts.
"The Warren District Commercial
club, acting In co-operation with the
mayor and city council, has called a
meeting of the citizens of this dis-j
trict to be held next Friday evening
at the City park at 8 o'clock for the
purpose of perfecting an organization,
to arrange committees to secure the
necessary signatures on petitions, to
acquaint the citizens of the district
with the proposition and to discuss
the possible sites in the district at
Warren, Lowell and Bisbee. In be
half of the Warren District Commer
cial club, and in behalf of the mayor
and common council, every citizen of
the district interested in the welfare
and progress of the Warren District
is urged to attend the meeting. We
will have on hand a speaker to explain
the present status of the matter and
will arrange for a general discussion
in which everyone may have his or
her part."

mittee are E. S. Roundtree and Jesse

BARBED WIRE FENCE
FOR BOUNDARY LINE
Gen. D. C. Cabell, commander of the
Arizona district, returned ' Saturday
night to Douglas from Washington,
where he was called to make a report
on the recent disturbance at Nogales.
He had been gone two weeks.
As a means of preventing border
friction in the future. General Cabell
recommended that a barbed wire
fence two miles long be built at the
boundary line both here and at No
gales. He was told that this recom
mendation would be carried out. The
fence will be built of high iron posts
imbedded in cement with wires
stretched every six inches. It will be
an effective barrier against smuggling
and fugitives of all sorts.
. The plan was agreed upon between
General Cabell and General Calles,
governor of Sonora, at their confer
ence at Nogales following the shoot
ing. General Calles as well as Gen
eral Cabell favored the idea. With the
fence in place, all persons will have
to pass through the international gate.
This will do awaywith ordering per
sons to halt here and there which
causes misunderstandings.
General Cabell made a report not
only to Gen. Peyton C. March, chief of
staff, but to the assistant secretary of
state and the assistant secretary of
the treasury, all of which departments I
are interested in border affairs. His i
report and recommendations seemed I
to be' entirely satisfactory to the
Washington officials.

in the Y. M. C. A. gymnasium was
pronounced a great success by the

The great event was to have com
menced with a boxing exhibition by

which resulted in a draw.
Between matches the Y. M. C. A.

the poisons which are swept from the
tissues, by the blood are not eliminat
ed through the kidneys, disease of one
form or another will claim you as a
victim.
Kidney disease is usually indicated
by weariness, sleeplessness, nervous
ness, despondency, backache, stomach
trouble, difficulty when .urinating,
pain iu -loins and lower abdomen, gall
stones, gravel, rheumatism, sciatica
aud lumbago.

PREFERRED
SETTING TAXES
(By Review Leased Wire)
WASHINGTON, Sept. 18. Income
tax provisions of the new revenue
law, affecting both individuals and
corporations and designed to raise $2,
376,000,000 of the measure's $8,000,
000,000 total, were approved today by
the house. No changes were made in
the rate proposed by the ways and
means committee and with considera
tion of the income tax sections, virtu
ally concluded, the house tomorrow
will take up the war excess profits
provisions, estimated to yield $3,200,
000,000. Two important modifications in the
inncome tax sections were made by
the house at the request of the ways
and means committee. Liberty bonis
of future issues shall be subject to the
reduced income tax rate of 12 per
cent instead of the normal 18 per
cent rate. Another permits corpora
tions and Individuals, in calculating
their Income, to deduct all interest
paid or accrued. A provision limiting
such deductions to the excess of "inter
est received free, as on Liberty bonds,
was eliminated.
During the day's debate, in which
Majority Leader Kltchin took steps to
expedite the bill's disposal, expressing
hope for its passage not later than
next Saturday, many amendments not
approved by the ways and means com
mittee were rejected. At the outset
the house defeated, 132 to 61. the
amendment by Representative Monta
gue of Virginia, democrat, to exempt
future issues of state, county and mu
nicipal bonds from federal income
taxation. Telegrams of protegt against
this section of the bill sent by many
mayors and "other local officials to
representatives, arrived after the
house had acted.
Efforts to extend to corporations
and partnerships the 15 per cent al
lowance given individuals for contri
butions to charity also were defeated
after lively discission. Representa
tive Robbln8 of Pennsylvania, repub
lican, and several other members
urged that corporations and partner
ships should in all fairness be given
the same privilege as Individuals for
donations to the Red Cross, the Y. M.
C. A., and other organizations engaged
in far welfare work.
In approving the corporation income
tax sections. Representative Long
worth of Ohio, republican, said that
the 18 per cent tax proposed three
times the present rates is less than
the 30 per cent British tax.
Representative : McKeown of Okla
homa, democrat, offered but the house
promptly rejected, an amendment to
have the lower rate apply, to funds
held and "actually needed" by a cor
poration. Provisions of the bill for allow
ances to oil and gas operators and
miners for depletions of their proper
ties, were temporarily passed over to
day by the house.

al hundred thousand dollars to buy a
newspaper in one of the chief cities
of the nation, which Mr. Palmer de
clared was fighting the battle of the

The Washington Times bought from

The cause of the wreck continues
a. puzzle to railroad and government
officials, inasmuch as the track where
the collision occurred is protected by
the block signal system Whether
either of the two train crews failed
to observe signals and ran into the
block a a result of carelessness or
whether some one had tampered with
the block signal clearing both trains
in the same block, probably will not be

8Y REVIEW
NEW YORK, ' Sept. 18 Reaction
from the recent heavy liquidation car-
ried some prominent issues steadily
upward in the stock marker, today.
presumably on the theo'y that a gen-
tially oversold con. ill 1011 existed. The
pressure which enforced the down-
ward movement of many of the spec-
ulative shares during the past veek
was absent, and professional buying
in various quarters, together with lib-
eral short covering, furnised a foua-
dation which had not been in evidence
for some time. Another influential
factor was the gratifying war news.
Many of the stocks advanced 1 to 4
points, some reaching new high
ground.
The upward swing was preceded,
shortly after the opening, but profit
taking from last night's closing ad-;
vance, as there was no confirmation '
of yesterday's rumors, which sent the
market uo on reports that the German j
emperor had abdicated. These losses
were quickly recovered, active pur-
chasing of oil stocks, which have been
persistently strong of late, imbuing
the general list with strength. Sales
amounted to 250,000 shares. -
. French government 5Vb established
a new high record at 100. Liberty
Bonds displayed a good tone, and
other issues were not essentially
changed. Total sales, par value, were '
$6.700."00.
United States bonds, old issues, un-
changed on call. j Hancock 5.Vi

GRAIN MARKET. I Inspiration , oW2
CHICAGO, Sept. 18. Likelihood of Kennecott
de-ay on shipments from the interior ; Keweenaw 80
more than counterbalanced in the corn ' Lake 5
market today the bearish influence of'l-a Salle 2V
a renewal of peace gossip. The finish Miami 2S1h,
was unsettled, varying from V4c net Mohawk 55'4
decline to c advance, with October Mayflower ,. ., 24
$1.JS to $1.52 and November : Nevada, ex. div 20V-i
Sl.40'4 to $1.49.
Oats eained Ac to Kc to c and
rwisions 2r to 85c. A majority of
traders finally adopted the opinion
that during the next few days a de-
crease In the movement of corn from t
rural points would not be surprising. (
In this connection it was said country
railroad agents were not yet familiar
with the' process required to obtain
permits for shipments and that a fall-,
ing off in arrivals here might be look-!
ed for. instead of the enlarged re-
ccipts which yesterday were preai'ted. I
Another bullish factor was a killing!
frost in northwestern Iowa, but esti-
mates quickly became current that
mere than SO per cent of the whole ,
United States crop was now safe fro-n
frost, and that within a week 10 per
cent additional would be out of dan-
ger. Bears then made the most of .
ppaee talk until general attention fo-1
cussed on the prospect of diminished
supplies. I
Liberal sales to Georgian Bay ports
strengthened oas.
Improved casa' demand gave an up--
ward slant to provisions.

of motorists use ZEROLENE.

from selected California asphalt-base
crude, it burns clean
and goes out with exhaust.
