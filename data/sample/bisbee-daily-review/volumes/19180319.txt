LONDON, March 18. The foreign
office tonight issued a statement era
bodying a protest of the entent pre
miers and foreign ministers assem
bled in London against Germany's ac
tion in the name of German peace, to
ward the Russian people. The protest
concludes:
"Peace ia loudly advertised, but un
der the disguise of verba! professions
lurk the brutal realities of war and thl
untempered rule of a lawless force.
"Peace treaties such as these we do
not and cannot acknowledge.
"We are fighting and mean to con
tinue fighting, in order to finish once
for all with this policy of plunder and
to establish in its place the peaceful
reign of organized justice.
Battle For Freedom ,
"As incidents of this long war unroll
themselves before our eyes, more and
more clearly do we perceive that the
battles for freedom are everywhere in
terdependent; that no separate enum
eration of them, is needed and that in
every case the single, but all-sufficient
appeal is to justice and right.
"Are justice and right going to win?
In so far as the issue depends on bat
tles yet to come, the nations whose
fate is in the balance may surely put
their trust in the armies, which, even
under conditions more difficult than
the present, have shown themselves
more than equal to the great cause en

Belief of Allies
(Hy Review Leased Wire)
WASHINGTON, March IS.
American miliiary observers hav
reached the conclusion that Ger
many's constant massing of men
on the western front is for de
fense and tr-at the lcng heralded
Teutonic offensive never will
materialize unless It develops as
a defensive Stieasure against the
growing pressure of the allied and
American lines.
This view, held for weeks by
some officers, is expressed offi
cially in the war department
weekly review of operations at
the tattle fronts. Fresh German
divisions an reported arriving in
the west, the review says, and the
density of the enemy forces h
nearly reached the point where
congestion of lines of communica
tion may interfere with flexibility,
of maneuver.
The review records the first un
assited American assault upon
the Germans, the trench raid at
dawn of March 11, wh-?n the ep
emy was driven out and hi 3 posi
tion penetrated for a distance of
300 yards. The Americans are
now in the trenches along the al
lied line at five different points

Referring to secretary Baker's
arrival in France, the review says
h? has had interviews with the
principal French authorities and
is about to undertake a careful
inspection of American schools,
training areas, rest camps and
sectors at the front.

ACTION AT FRONT
(By Rttvh-w leased Wire)
WITH THE AMERICAN ARMY IN
FRANCE, Saturday. March 16 (By The
Ass'd Prssl Lieutenant Colonel Mat
thew A. mley of an Infantry unit .on
the Luneville sector, whose home Is
in Council Bluffs. Iowa, and Major Wia
J. Donovan of another unit on the same
sector, whose home is in Buffalo, have
been cited for bravery in French divis
ional and army corps orders. The ci
tation carries with it the French war
cross.
Major Donovan's citation says: -"A
higher officer who showed bril
liant military qualities notably on
March 7 and 8, giving during a violent
bombardment a iemarkable example
of bravery, activity and presence of
mind."
Major Donovan, on March 7 and 3,
although his own unit had just been
relieved, steadiad a new unit which
had never been ii. the trenches before
during a heavy and accurate shelling.
A French officer who was in the
trenches at the time reported to his
superiors that Major Donovan was
"the best officer under fire he had ev
er seen."
Until the United States entered the
war. Major Donovan was a lawyer in
Buffalo.
Lieutenant Colonel Tinley's citation
says that "during a violent enemy at
tack he directed with coolness, calm
ness and experiance defensive opera
tions and thanks to the brilliant way
in which orders were given before and
during the fight, he succeeded in keep
ing the line intact despite the efforts
of-the enemy, who was aided by pow
erful artillery."
This incident occurred during a raid
March 5 northeast of Badonviller when
the Germans knocked the American
positions almost to pieces with shells
and then attacked in waves. Although
.the American forces were shaken by
he artillery fire. Lieutenant Colonel
Tinley gathered them together and or
ganized them and .when the German
infantry appeared it met with a hot re
ception. After a sharp fight the ene
my was forced to withdraw.

GERMAN SAYS SUB
WARFARE WINNING .
- WAR FOR ENTENTE
(F!y Review taMd 'Wire)
AMSTERDAM. March 1S1 .In the
course of a speech before the imperial
trades association. Dr. Karl Helffertch
formerly secretary of the Imperial
treasury, accusing Great Britain of
waging war for an economic over
throw of German, world competition.
according to advices from Berlin, as
serted that things had turned out dif
ferently than Great Britain had expect
ed. .
"By means of the U-boat war," he
said, "we laid the axe to the root of
Great Britain ? strength with incom-
paratively greater. effectiveness tnan
did Napoleon with his continental in
terdiction. But we must not overlook
how systematically and successfully
Great Britain has executed her econ
omic program.
"By the institution of her black list,
by intimidation and violence, by her
application of the thumb screw of Ima
ger, she also rootricted economic inter -course
of our neutral neighbors with
us. .
By sequestration and forced liqu.-
dation. by abrogation of treaties. ro'
bery of our potents, destruction of our
settlements, squandering of our stocks
of goods and by every kind of chican
cery and oppression? . Great Britain
sought everywhere to destroy our econ
omic interests.
"If final peace is to return to us
what our enemies have taken and de
stroyed; if it fails to restore us free
dom 'in our work and our support of
enterprise in the world, then the Ger
man people ara crippled for an im
measurable period, .When Mr. Bonar
Law, in a recent speech, proclaimed
for the hundredth, time that the on
unalterable war aim of the allies' was
the destruction ol German militarism
I replied to him: Long live the Ger
man people's 'ainiy."'
After referring to what he called
Lloyd George's blasphemies in the
name of freedom at the City Temple
and his "daring at the moment of the
oppression of Holland to hail the free
dom of all peoples' as a war aim well
pleasing to God," Dr. Helfferich "con
cluded: ,.
"The peace which we need above all
is an economic peace. We have, how
ever, first to win. If It must be, then
the German people will endure this
final .extreme test. We all are confi
dent of the issue. We demand restor
ation for all violations of law and all
acts of destruction. We demand in
demnification for all damage done and
we meet the plan of ' differentiation
with a demand. for the most favored
nation 'treatment aud equal rights:
the pla'n of exclusion with a demand
for the open door and free seas, and

N'CW YORK. March IS. A new and;
mere complicated phase of the int-orn-.
atianal situation was injected in to -
day's stock market. Rumors of a
protest by Hollanl at the propose !
rommandeerinR of Dutch ships by this
government formed the basis of heavy
selling. Important rails and Indus-
irials reacted 1 to 3 points and some
specialties considerably more, tie
eelline assumiue wide dimensions in
the final hour.
Many stocks ordinarily classed
cmonK the leaders were scarcely
quoted on toward the close. Cana
dian Pacific was heavy to weak
throushout. extending last week's
seven? reversal by 3. points. Other
rranscontinentals. also errain carriers
and coalers were down 1 to 2 points
with shares of eastern roads.
Amen? specialties. American Suma
tra Tobacco which "may be adversely
affected by the Dutch situation, broke
4 K points. S"rars and oils were into

Bjnds. both rails and industrials,
were sympathetically depressed and
Liberty issues also reacted. Total

Vnitei States bonds, old issues, were
unchanged on call.

Though the metal have failed of re
warding him with millions through
many years of consistent standing by
them with work and money invest
ment, the minerals may be by way of
handing Bob Mennessy the return in
seven figures or bettter which I hia
due. and which there is probobly no
body in the Warren District that its
people along with the prospectors and
miners of southern Arizona generally, j
would rather see in possession of the
same. It would make them all happy t
to see "Bob" walking around with a
check book good for a million bucss.
The possibilities in this line were
very modestly referred to yesterday
by Mr. Hennessy upon his return from
a visit to ranch property which he pur
chased a few years ago in the general
! vicinity of Ft. Worth, Texas. That
country is now having a great oil
j boom. Forty miles from the Hennessy
i ranch they recently brought in a big
gusher, and eighteen miles from the
million dollars flat for his one-eigbta
interest. He gave as his reason the
declaration that a million dollars was
more than he would know what to do
with at one time, and figured that he
couldworr y along for a while on S54o
a day.
.45 1 "Eastarn Texas is in good shape, but
n the plight of Western Texas is pitia
.06 1 ble," said Mr. Hennessy yesterday in
.05' commenting on general conditions.
.15 "The government must take hold there
.03 and provide a way to give the people
.04 assistance, if we are going to measure
...jup properly on the practical side of
l.S3the business of efficiency and conser

j they are hopeful of oats and of feed.
3 25 But they are. bankrupt. .They held on
-- to their cattle until the last, hoping
2 j against hope, that relief would come
"jj'j about tn ope way or another, and they
'8j put -every dollar thejr bad and every
'I- j dollar they ctjuld borrow Into holding
'j.jbn. .'Many found when they were con
fronted with 'absolute necessity of let
"il 1 ting go that they had. nothing to let go
t j of, their cattle having got so thin that
" they could not, stand shipping. So
"2. j these ratchets' are .bankrupt today.
I Relieved of this plight they would add
i products of the soil and' in cattle this
' 7ear ttnd tnia must somehow be man-
1 aged- We cannot afford as a nation to
let resources of any kind slip through
our fingers during tbe war."
Robert Hennessy has been resl-
1 dent of Bisbee more thaat thirty years.
I For a number of these he has been en
i gaged in the undertaking business.
I Rheumatism a few years ago fastened
I upon him and in seeking relief from
i the trouble he went to Texas. His In
i terest in ranch property there was one
! of the outcomes. Since then he has di

residence in the district he has be?n

I character wherever anil whenever it
! was brought to his attention anil to
whatever lengths his pocket ixxk
would permit.
. He has enough mining stock certifi-

! which netted hopes only, to start a
bon-fire that would make his Satanic
j Majesty wonder who was setting up
the opposition. In between, it needs
1 be said, he made some business invest-
intents in mining shares which helped
quite a little, and also some profitable
realty investments in tne city. He nas
not been downright poor for a long
time, but not so strong in the opposite
direction that he would not find plenty
of time to appreciate a million or so
from the oil possibilities of his Texas
holdings.

BOOKS.
With cargo space on ocean carriers at an
almost priceless value, General Pershing
has set aside capacity for one hundred thou
sand books a month for the soldiers of our
national army in France. A strongly writ
ten book is almost as valuable to a man, be
he soldier man or civilian, as meat and
drink. Anyway, our general must so be
lieve or he would not give a square inch
of space from our frail bridge to France for
mere books when the demand for shells
and food is greater than can be met.
And the general is surely right. The
printed page is a comforter, guide and
friend to whoever' will turn to it for help.
It will keep a soldier man out of mischief;
it will make him an officer and a gentle
man; it will add to his courage and give
him an inspiration like a flame. It will cure
him of the blues and bring his home across,
the waters. It will tell him of the deathless
heroism of the men who have fought
through the ages fcr la Belle France. It
will unfold and spread before him the pic
ture of Roland's last fight at Roncesvalles ;
of Big Fere's battle with the eleven Burgun
dians; of how Bayard, the good knight,
without fear and without reproach, held the
bridge; of DuGusclin in the lists at Bor
deaux; of .the immortal Jean of Arc, the
soldier maid, who saved France ; of Ney, the
bravest of the brave, at Waterloo. Ah, the
printed page ii a paneca for pain; it is sun
light in the gloom ,and it is a white, strong
hand that leads a man up and on to the best
that is in him.
The Cbpper Queen library in Biabee
wants to raise a hundred books as its quota
for the soldiers. Go today and take one
book; three from your library shelf and
give it as a message and token from your
sheltered home to either soothe or inspire
a soldier lad over there. Trie better the
book, the better the deed. Bring or send it
to the library during the day or to The Re
view office at night.
TUCSON OUGHT TO
BE WHEAT TERMINAL.
(From the El Paso Herald.)
Tucson ought to be made the wheat
terminal for Arizona in justice to the wheat
growers of the state who are entitled to the
best prices they can secure for their prod
uct. Los Angeles now is the wheat termi
nal for Arizona. Arizona farmers are paid
$2. 1 0 a bushel, less the freight from the
point of production to Los Angeles, which
makes the net prices something under $2
a bushel, generally $1.80 to $1.85, depend
ing on the distance. This is considerably
less than the $2 guaranteed price which
President Wilson and Food Administrator
H. C. Hoover intended farmer should
have.
Tucson is centrally located, has good rail
road facilities and good storage facilities as
well, and should be made the shipping term
inal for the state. The general public inter
est would be quite as well served and that
of the wheat farmers of the state much bet
ter served. A price to the farmer of $2.10
less freight to. Tucson would give most
grain grcwers a price of $2 a bushel and
some a few cents over. A few cents a
bushel on thousands of bushels is import
ant. Suggestion has been made that there be
three wheat terminals in Arizona, Phoenix,
Tucson and Safford. This i3 scarcely prac
tical, for if there were to be three terminals,
why not more? Or why any at all? It
has also been suggested that Phoenix be
made the terminal, as being the center cf
the larcrest wheat growing district in the
state. That would be unfair to wheat grow
ers of Safford and the Gila valley who
would be obliged to scrd their grain a long,
roundabout distance by rail and conse
quently would receive much lcs; for their
crops than the Phrerix and Tucson farm
ers. Conversely, establishment of the term
inal at Safford would wcrk a hardship on
the Phoenix growers, besides placing the
terminal at a place not on a main line rail
wav. Td-.icn b lIvs mcst ce'.-.Lraily located phiz
to be found for a grain terminal, being fair
iy near lo equadistant between the Gila
valley and the Salt River valley. Most cf the
grain in the state is raised in those two val
leys. While a considerable amount is raised
in the Santa Cruz valley between Noga'es
and Tucson, it does -not seem very large in
comparison with the yield of the other two
valleys. The northern part of the state need
not be considered, for its wheat production
is not large enough to figure in the total
nor in the selection of a grain terminal.
Arizona's state food administrator, T. A.
Riordan, is understood to have recommend
ed to the national food administration that
Tucson be made the terminal point and to
have set forth the reasons therefor, reasons
which are evident enough to those who are
engaged in wheat farming in the stale. It
is desired that every possible acre of wheat
be grown in Arizona and every other state
this year and nothing will be more of stimu
lus to Arizona than the higher price which
transfer of the terminal to Tucson will
make available. The farmers ought not to
be charged that extra freight to Los Angeles
.when it can be avoided.
It is understood that the national food ad
ministration has to consider what effect
' such authorization might have as a prece
dent, ' especially in other parts of the wejt
where distances ara long and freight rates
high, but Mr. Hoover can afford to give a
great deal of thought to any course, which
promises to benefit and encourage the farm
ers to produce more wheat for ourselves and
our allies.

the Past Week
TROTZKY AND LENINE.
The New York Times, in a masterly edi
torial upon Trotzky and Lenine, those p
harlequins who suddenly strutted across
the Russian stage, declares of Trotzky, the
mouse who played with the tiger:
"Trotzky is gone, the absurd little figure
that strutted so pathetically through his
burlesque tragedy. Not for. generations
will history forget the brisk, sleek, know
ing cockney, jauntily stepping forward to
confront the German colossus and worst.it
with witty turns of phrase and confident
similes, and before history he will always
wear the look of dismay, the dropped jaw,
the startled eyes, with which he received the
buffet that tossed him out of the way when
the time had come to make an end of non
sense." And of Lenine it says:
"Lenine reigns alone; he still drives his
betrayed people into the path of shame and
surrender, with that unflecked consistency
of resolve that finds its base either in cor
ruption or in a devotion to theory which is
literally mad, which has a well-known-pathological
origin.
"He will not reign long. This can be
said even though we receive with reserve
the reports of an arousing sense of nation
alism in Russia. He cannot reign long be
cause the shameful peace into which he has
beaten and goaded that people is bound to
bring about a situation in which there is
no room for him. Russia may never regain
strength enough to save herself from the
foreign master to whom Lenine surrender
ed her, but she will certainly receive her
peace of degradation in a different spirit
from that which she followed him along the
path to it; and whatever her future may be,
it will not be a future that he can command.
When his brief hour ends, he will have the
staisfaction of knowing that he did more to
the human race than was ever done by one
man in any such short time since history
began to be recorded in the tombs alons' the
Nile." .

Road Work Will
Not Be Stopped
At a special meAMng of the board of
supervisors of Cochise county, held
yesterday in Tombstone, which was at
tended by State Engineer Attwood and
L. C. Whitney of the State Institutions
Commission, an amicablcf agreement
was reached whereby the state work
on the highway between this city and
Tombstone will be continued.
There was some misunderstanding
on both sides regarding the matter and
when both sides met in Tombstone
yesterday in the office of the board of
supervisors it did not take them long
to settle them. Mr. Attwood stated
that the state was more than willing
to meet the board half way and that
thoy wished to see the road work com
pleted into Tombstone as soon as pos
sible. Thisview met with the view of
the board of supervisors and there will
be no cessation of the work, so that
bootleggers and other violators of the
misdemeanor class will have a place
to spend their summer months in as
sisting in building the scenic road be
tween this city and Tombstone.
It has not yet been definitely declJ
ed who will be seut down from Phoe
nix to take charge of the work but it
is understood that IL C. Perkins, who
has been appointed as Division Engi
neer by State Engineer Attwood, wii!
be the man who will have charge of
the work. Mr. Perkins has already
made a visit to Cochise county and has
inspected the work that has been done
and has conferred with the members
of the road camp forces so that they
understand each other and that there
will b eno change in the organization
if 'hat fen-e.
The fact that an amicable agreement
has been reached by the "hoard and the
stain officials will be pleasing, news
to all of the traveling public in the
southern part of Arizona and tourists
as well. It will Uke hut a few months
more work to complete the work into ,

PARAMOUNT STAR IN
THE SUNSET TRAIL IS
ATTRACTION AT EAGLE
Miss Vivian Martin, Paramount':!
winsome, captivating, diminutive star,
will ppear in "The Sunset Trail" at the
Eagle theatre today. This is a fascin
ating, thrilling, intensely interesting
story of a little mountain girl whos-3
unshakable faith brought happiness
and contentment to a home that "went
- 'wrong." "The Sunset Trail" is a pleas
ing photo-drama that is bound to ere-'
ate more than ordinary interest bo
cause it is a mountain story built along
distinctly different lines, with a most
unusual and unexpected twist at the
end. Whatever you do, don't miss "The I
Sunset TraiL" j
If you've watched Miss Martin's ,
meteoric screen career, you know that j
she is one of the sweetest, most win
some of the younger screen stars a ;
little artiste who leaped into Instant 1
popularity when she first appeared in
Paramount pictures. With Vivian Mar-:
tin at the helm, you may be assured
that jour pleasure ship will be steered
clear of the disappointment shoals. '
She's the little girl you'll always come .
back to see.
CAMP FUNSTON BAND
MAY TOUR IN WEST
.. .... . ,
The big military banc composed of
national army soldiers in training at
Camp Funston may soon come to the
barren District, according to a letter
received here yesterday from Carl
Spangler, of Hayden, who is a member
of the organization.
According to Spangler many of the
boys belonging to the band are from
Arizona and they are anxious to make
the trip to this state. While it is not
thought possible that the entire band
of 100 pieces will visit this city, it is
believed that about 30 musicians will
make the trip.
Through concerts which they have
already put on in the middle-west the
boys have raised sufficient money to
pay their transportation here and ex
pect to be able to earn sufficient mon
ey on a concert tour of this state to
meet all living expenses and transpor
tation. Private Spangler stated in his letter
that a most excellent musical program
has been especially prepared by the
musicians for a tour of Arizona.

TRENCH FEVER HAS

(By Review Leased Wire)
PARIS, Sunday, March 17. In an
nouncing tliat it has definitely de
termined that the disease called
trench fever is transmitted by lice.
th3 American Red Cross research
committee sets forth other facts re-j

"The disease is a hitherto unknown

although called trench fever, may be '
transmitted by lice brought from
countries where no trenches ever ex
isted, as subjects bitten by lice hatch
ed from eggs brought from England
developed the same as those bitten by
lice from the trenches.
The fever has been resopnsible for
great loss of man power at the front,
and the discovery of its cause is r
garded as of incalculable value to all
the allied armies, as preventive mea
sures may now be applied as in the
cas of the mosquito after that insect
bad been proved a carrier of yellow
fever germs. The volunteers infect

It was decided to include three
teams in the-league, all local clubs.
These are the Junction-Briggs, C. &

Carnes will pilot the latter outfit on
the playing field while GUI Pittman
will lead the Junction-Briggs players
with Mickey Morris in charge of the

j A tentative schedule has been diaft
i ed and the probable date for the open
! ing game is April 14 although the play
ing dates have not been formally
adopted. It was decided to divide the
playing season into two races with
the winners of the first half season
i of play clashing with the victors dur
ing the second half In a post season
series.
The matter of umpires was taken up
and efforts to sign Kitty Braahear
and Jimmy Toman, both former coast
league arbitrators, will be made. Two
such competent officials in charge of
th- play should help much to make
for better baseball this year than last
season.
Plan Season Tickets.
Two games will be played each
week with one on Sunday and the oth

in first place will play the club in

There is no foundation for the alleged
violations of law attributed to our Com
pany by agents of the Federal Trade
Commission and I want to say emphatic
ally that Swift & Company is not a party to
any conspiracy to deiraud the Govern
ment Nor has Swift & Company been
guilty of improperly storing foods or of
making false entries or reports.
Conferences of packers, where prices
have been discussed, have been held at
the urgent request and in the presence
of representatives of either the Food
Administration or the Council of National
Defense. And yet the packers have been
accused of committing a felony by acting
in collusion on Government bids !
We have done our best, with other
packers, large and small, to comply with
the directions of the United States Food
Administration in all particulars, including
the furnishing of food supplies for the U. S.
Army and Navy and the Allies, now be
ing handled through the Food Adminis
tration. We will continue to do our utmost.un-
der Government direction, to increase our
production and assist the Food Adminis
tration. We consider ihat the opportunity
to co-operate whole-heartedly and to our
fullest powers with this branch of the
Government is our plain and most press
ing duty.
The Trade Commission Attorney has,
'by false inference and misplaced empha
sis, given to disconnected portions of the
correspondence taken from our private
files and read into the Record, a false and
sinister meaning with the plain purpose
of creating antagonistic public opinion.
The services of the packers of the
United States are most urgently needed,
and I regret exceedingly that we should at
this time have to spend our efforts in
defending ourselves against unfounded,
unproved, and unfair assertions such as
are being daily made public.

good. The road from Tucson via of
Benson. Tombstone, through Bisbee,
on to Douglas and the east is in very
good shape.
FROM RANCH.
Sam Coleman was in the city yes
terday from his headquarters on the
Lower San Pedro river. Ke states
that cattle in that vicinity are In very
good shape and will winter without
much loss. He still has the scar on
his forehead where it deflected Ui-2
44 bullet from the gun of a Villa
Lindit in Mexico over a year aso.
The force of the bullet knocked him
rnconscious and, th?y left him for
ucad, but Sam says he fooled them
end came back to life after they had
gone. He does net care for a similar
experisnce. c
IT WAS SOME COLD.
Sunday night was one of the coldest
experienced for several weeks. Ice
formed in exposed places in Warren
and in Tombstone Canyon. The ther
mometer at the E. P. & S. W. depot,
which is in a sheltered place, regis
tered 33 degrees above. Tne lowest
point reached before during the month
was 40 on Saturday night. In Warren
ice formed over all water that was left
standing. It is. feared that some dam
age was done to .the fruit trees in
Tombstone Canyon but so far none has
been reported. There was not as much
cold wind In that locality as there was
in the vicinity of Warren.

ed statements inimical to the interests
of the United States in the war and

act, and. if convicted, will be interned

NO ArtORE ENLISTMENTS.
Those who have been on the fence
and unable to make up their minds as
to whether or not to volunteer and en
list in their favorite branch of the ar
my will be chagrined to learn that no
more volunteer enlistments in the ar
my will be allowed to men of Arizona.
This applies to registered men only
The local board received orders from
Provost Marshal General Crowder yes
terday requiring them to cancel all vol
untary calls into the service. The only
way that registered men in Arizona
can get into any branch of the army
now is to be lucky enough to have or
der numbers near the top of the list.
This order does iot apply to the navy
or marine corps. Enlistments in these
branches of the service are still open.
No reason is given for the order from
the provost marshal general, but It Is
known that an enormous number of
men have volunteered from the baby
state, in proportion to Its quota.
