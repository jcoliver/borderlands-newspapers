Of Leaders In Cold Silence
. BERLIN, Wednesday, May 21. (By '
the Associated Press.) The majority :
Socialists held a demonstration of pro-1
test against the peace terms in the
wuneimpiatz today. The crowd, in
contrast with earlier meetings, re
ceived the speeches of leaders in
frigid silence.
Chancellor . Scheidemann said he
hoped in the interest of humanity to
attain a peace by understanding on
the basis of the German counter pro
posals. A peace of conciliation only
will be possible if Germany is in
cluded as an equal in the league of
nations. The league,: he -declared, was
a necessary essential but' the govern
ment was against the present form, 1
which made the Germans the slaves '
of other nations. He concluded by
calling for cheers for the league. ;
Herr Mueller for the Independent
Socialists, said the Socialists of all
countries must regard peace as impos-
sible under the present treaty.
Frau Juchacz said if the allied peace
terms were carried out they would
perpetuate a war of hunger. I
The Independent Socialists also held
a demonstration. !
"SLAVERY" PROTESTED
PARIS, May 22. (By the Associated

Paris indicate that German opposi
tion to the peace treaty centers chiefly
about the inter-allied commission on

for the purpose of collecting indemni
ties. The Germans, it is said, re
gard this provision as an infringement
of their sovereignty and declare that
submission to a foreign commission
with such broad powers would mean
nothing but slavery.

WARM DEBATE AS
WAR RISK PASSES
Soldier Insurance Delayed By
Wilson, Says Mann;G.O.P
To Blame, Is Retort .
WASHINGTON, May 22. Passage
by the house late today of a deficiency
bill providing urgent appropriations
of $45,044,500 for war risk allowances
to soldiers' and sailors' families and
Civil war pensioners made another
speed record for the new house, which
yesterday adopted the woman suffrage
resolution. The first sharp partisan
I clashes of the session between Repub
licans and Democrats occurred today
! during discussion of the deficiency
bill. v
The measure authorized appropria
tions of $39,615,000 for allowances due
May 1 and June 1 to about 700,000
families of soldiers, sailors and ma
rines, $3,000,000 for delayed Civil war
pensions and $2,429,500 for adminis
tration of the war risk insurance bu
reau. It was passed without a dissent
ing vote after considerable partisan
discussion. Republicans and Demo
crats making counter charges of re
sponsibility for payment delays.
I Republican Leader Mondell, Demo-
cratic Leader Clark and others par
t ticipated in the partisan maneuering,
' which followed a statement by Repre-
entatie Mann of Illinois, former Re
oublican leader, that President Wil
son's absence abroad might prevent
the bill'B appropriation from becom
ing available until the middle of
June.
Republican Filibuster Blamed
Representative Byrnes of Tennessee,
ranking Democrat of the appropriation
committee, charged that Republican
senators through their filibuster of
last March were responsible for hold
ing up the war risk allowances. The
Tennessee representative declared the
Republicans now "should remedy the
wrong' 'and urged that the bill be
passel at once instead of being put
over until tomorrow as proposed by
I Representatie Good of Iowa, chairman
of the appropriations committee..
After the bill had reported Repub
lican Leader Mondell moved to ad
journ until tomorrow but on a rising
vote of 7 7to 73, the Democrats, who
happened at the time to have a ma
jority in the chamber, defeated the
move. Democratic Leader Clark then
asked unanimous consent for imme
diate consideration of the measure
and Mr. Mondell assented. The meas
ure was passed In less than an hour
without a roll call.
Mann Accuses Wilson
During the partisan ' skirmishing.
Representative Mann charged that
President Wilson was responsible en
tirely for delay in the appropriations
and the hardships of soldiers' families
due to failure to receive their May 1
checks. He added that the president
had neglected or refused to call con
gress sooner because of fear that the
league of nations would be discussed.
Democrats sharply retorted that the

The Company Of
The Future
Temporary offices at the Copper Queen Hotel have been opened for
the convenience of my friends. As our quota is limited, I would ad
vise all of them who are interested to call at my office without delay
where I will take pleasure in giving the information they desire.
We wish to advise our friends that in justice to the organizers of the
company we had allotted portions of the unsold stock to certain dis
tricts. These allotments are not as large as we wish we could make"
them, but we are having to turn down applications for stock from
eastern people in order to protect the home people.
The quota set aside for all of the various districts is being absorbed
very rapidly, and by this we mean that it is only a question of days.
In making reservation for their Warren District friends the members
of the board feel that they are offering them a real investment As
soon as the stock .is all sold we have no doubt of its advancing' in
price. This advancement will be stable because of the enhanced value
of our properties since we purchased them and-the sound character
of our organization. We hope careful investors will realize the op
portunity that is,.thus given nnrr avail themselves of it before it is
too late. . "

BEING CONSTRUCTED
PHOENIX, May 22. Active and
definite preparations for the construc
tion of the Arizona Packing com
pany's plant, the huge new concern
recently announced to make Phoenix
ita headquarters are now under way
and engineers are engaged in laying
out the site for the plant and the rail
road facilities it will require.
The plant will be located on the
Tempe road, five miles east of the
city. A tract of CO acres has been
purchased for the site. Railroad con
nections have been arranged by run
ning a half mile spur track from the
Arizona Eastern's lines, and ample
side track will be available Inside the
plant. The plant itself Is to face on
the Tempe road.
The plant will center about a main
building of reinforced concrete, four
strieg In height, with dimensions or
20Q by 250 feil. Around U will be
grouped other and smaller buildings.
The plant will also include large stock
yard . accommodations. When the
plant Is completed it will employ 250
to 500 men. The plant will use both
steam and electrical power, with a
200 horsepower capacity independent
of any other agencies. The total cost
of the plant will be $500,000.
( Will Establish Townsite
Coincident with the erection of the
big' plant; it is announced, the com
pany will provide ample living accom
modations, for its ' employes on the
site it has purchased. A townsite will
be laid out adjacent to the plant, and
acre tracts with homes are already
being planned for the company's em
ployes. A remarkable large number of prom
iuent stockmen and business men
from all parts of the state have be
come interested in the new packing
industry, realizing that the establish
ment of such an enterprise will stab
ilize the industry throughout the state

LETTERS OF FORMER
ARIZONA SOLON AIRED
IN L. A. DIVORCE SUIT
A Los Angeles dispatch under date
of May 22 says:
"Although a prolific writer of burn
ing love letters, Assemblyman Wil
liam J. Graham of Arizona did not be
lieve that his honeyed words should
be preserved to posterity because 'they
surely cause trouble.'
"Therefore, he is alleged to have
written to Mrs. Loula. Frame, 624
Hyde street, wife of John Frame, he
admonished to her to be sure and de
stroy them, but Mrs, Frame could not
destroy the burning . words and they
fell into the hand3 of her husband. .
"Frame, however, did . not get the
letters until his wife sued for divorce,
charging cruelty. He then broke fnto
her private trunk."
One of the letters quoted in the Los
Angeles story is as follows:
Mrs. Loila Frame: I have not done
a single thing that I did not tell yon of.
I have been too close to you to feel
me so much and you make a damn
poor stall In your letter. I was and
am heartsick at your actions for I felt
we would be pals all of our lives. I
expected you to be just square with
Billy. I am awful sick and tired of
this legislature and want no more of
it. Loula, I feel miserable, but if I am
wrong I would be happy enough to be
repaid for the suffering. Hon, I surely
worshipped you, and ho matter what
happens you can always look back and
say 'Billy honestly loved me." I feel
too bitter to write much. I will prob
ably be home in a couple of days. If
you lack incentive your 'own pride
should make you cherish the respect I
hold for you.' But as to your sarcasm
concerning married women or other
women, I will say it is very far fetch
ed bunk and you know it. One lesson
I have learned and that is that when
a man's love won't hold a girl he Is a
fool to try to hold her. Well, bye, bye,
Hon. I certainly Ibved my little pal
and I guess I do a little yet. Lots of
love. . BILLY.
Graham, now a resident of Phoenix,
at one time held the office of con
stable at Lowell and subsequently
served as a deputy sheriff of Cochise
county. He was elected representa
tive to the first Arizona state legis
lature in 1912. Graham was also well
knbwn in baseball circles, here, offi

THE DIVIDEND NOTICE of the JAGGERRS-WLALACE OIL CORPORATION which is
being published from Maine to California., created just as much sensation among those familiar
with Burkburnett stocks as did the BURK-WAGGONER when she came in a gusher and stock
holders who paid $75 for their stocks were paid $3,333.33 for their shares. One share of
BURK-WAGGONER cost one of our clients $75 and he received $3,333.33. There has been
no GUSHERS to create a sensation for JAGGERS-WALLACE, but in a quiet way this Com
pany during the past year have been getting production. They have been accumulating valu
able property. This Company paid $330,000.09 in cash for their interest in Block 101 with
three producing wells. They have since brought in another well which brings their production in
Block 101 up to approximately 2,500 barrels.
We learn from an associate that they paid $95,000 for the FIVE ACRES in Block 86 and
the TWENTY ACRES in Block 71 and this" was before the fancy prices Were paid in these
blocks. '
: r J AGGERS-WALLACE has 102 acres in thi RANGER FIELD surrounded by production.
They have one well producing approximately 600 barrels a day.
They will have another well in the Ranger Field in production within the next fifteen days
and within the next fifteen days will have anothsr well on the sand in Burkburnett
Their production today is 3,000 barrels daily at least, which means $6,000 NET IN CASH
DAILY OR $180,000 A MONTH. This' production will be increased monthly and as a prom
inent Arizona man said, within three months they should be producing 7,500 barrels daily.
' The Dividend.
Explained.
We have received wires asking for an exact explanation of the Company dividend an
nouncement: It is perfectly plain to us. If you own 100 shares of Jaggers-Wallace now, or if
you own 100 shares up to May 30, 1919, you will receive from the Company an additional 100
shares. THAT'S YOJJR STOCK DIVIDEND. You will receive also on June 1st a cash dixi
dend of Ten per cent This cash dividend is an extra additional dividend to; the Company
regular 20 per cent cash dividend. After June 1st you will be a stockholder of record for 200
shares and when the next cHdidend is paid you will receive a cash dividend on the 200 shares. -
We are reliably informed that the Company will pay after June 1st dividends monthly and
if their production is held up to 3,000 barrels, and in our mind the production will be increased,
the dividend will be 10 per cent monthly instead of 30 per cent yearly.
We have announced that your order for stock should be registered with us by Tuesday,
May 27th, in order to absolutely assure you of your becoming a stockholder of record. We as
BROKERS, want to see you on the books of the Company before June 1st If you wire us your
reservations we will immediately notify the Company, whose head office is at Fort Worth;

this dividend. ,

Something Besides Hustle
' This morning you jumped out of bed 15 minutes before breakfast,
rushed to the train or the trolley 15 minutes after your breakfast and
you've been rushing ever since.
There hasn't been a single minute during the day when you quietly
collected your thoughts you've been too busy collecting money or
making it some other way.
You don't know your wife and your children don't know you al
though you're "working your head off for the folks at home.
You have taken your share, of Liberty Bond3 and you contribute
cash to most of the worthy causes in your community.
You're a "hustler" full of "pep"
But if every man in this country were like you, business, families,
civics and philanthropies would go a-glimmering.
For these are kept alive and made strong not so much through
money, but because some people are giving time and thought to them.
There's such a thing as "ideals" in business although we're just be
ginning to find it out. And ideals don't grow without culture any more
than do strawberries.
And family life needs more than a check book even with a wife's
unlimited drawing privilege. Your children need YOU more than they
need' YOURS.
Our cash balances in social and economic organizations may be
all to the good, but if the average citizen gives no attention to the
increasingly perplexing problems in our country, thinking that the money
he gave is sufficient, then we are in a fair way of having these problems
handled to our detriment by partisan politicians and unscrupulous agita
torsfor they'll see to it that they get the backing they need to put
through their schemes while you're "hustling" on your own job.
Better put a little more "heart" into it. It will make the whole
Job better and bigger. And you'll enjoy it more as you go along instead
of waiting until you "retire". Which process would be sure to finish
you in short order. '
Cheer Up, Man
Cheer up, Man, it's not so bad as your looks imply. It's pretty
serious, of course, but cheer up. The sun's still shining and your family
is well and happy and business is pretty good, so, for heaven's sake, take
it a more cheerfully. Of course, of course, we know all about that aching
back and the callouses on your hands and all that, but it isn't going to
do you a bit of good to fret and 6tew and worry about it. It's got to be
done, you know. ' .
time and down-in-the-mouth and disgruntled and crusty and cross about
time and down-inthe-mouth and disgruntled and crusty and cross about
it, but why take it out on the wife? You don't want her to do it, do you?
Surely you haven't back-slid so far as to want her to groan and moan
and perspire her way through it, do you? On the level, old top, it's not
so terrible bad as- your long face and your trembling frame would in
dicate. ' f
Of course no man likes to do, we know that. But- you know
that thousands of men will do it all summer and that ought to be some
consolation to you. Besides it surely must be some slight comfort to
realize that it is good for you.
You know what we're referring to, of course we're referring to the
job of mowing your lawn!
When a Bad Memory is Better Than a Good One
f
If you tie a string around your finger, that's w,hat they call
mnemonics or the art of improving the memory.
There are times, however, when we don't want to remember at all.
vTnere are people (the kaiser, for instance, and the Prussian governor of
Belgium) we. would like to forget.
There ought to be tricks in forgetting just as there are tricks in
remembering.
We have all done mean little wrong things we would like to forget
The same scientists who are studying mnemonics and how to improve
the memory ought to Bhow us how to wreck our memories those we
don't want.
i If we could tie a string around the finger and forget, how easy that
would be. Then Pill Higgins, sore at Lizzie Jones because Lizzie Jones
says she'll never, never, never marry him, could just tie a string around
his finger and fix it up to forget Lizzie Jones forever and ever.
Alter memonics, the art of improving the memory, is well de
veloped, we should like to see a new science, the art of improving our
"forgettery," come along.
New Classification
The ages of man have been classified a great many times and in an
equally large number of ways, but the one that appeals most to us
follows: ,
First was the Individualistic period. The timewhen the cave man
went out with his club and conquered or killed all wfco crossed his path,
lie tolerated no one who was not stronger physically.
Second, came those thousands of years in which our policy was to
"live and to let live." We didn't kill or maim those who opposed us.
We ignored them. We allowed them to live.
' Third, the newer order of things that has come as a result of the
war, the slogan of which is "live and help others to live."
We have awakened to the fact that weaker nations and weaker men
and women must be given a chance to work out their destinies along
with the stronger. '
We are approaching an UtQia.
The more we study the peace treaty, the more we are persuaded
that it does almost as much to Germany as she would have done to us
if she had won.
Senators do not cuss the peace treaty as freely as they cussed the
league constitution. They have learned not to talk too much before
putting their ear3 to the ground.
The world is full of men who will keep their word when keeping it
means a loss to the other fellow.
American Reds will fall by the wayside when they learn that Trot

decision, notice of which has just been
received in Phoenix, the commisioner
of the general land office at Washing
ton has affirmed the refusal of the
local office to grant mining claims
situated in the Grand Canyon reserve
to Ralph Cameron, well known mining
man. The case has eben pending in
various courts of the United States

claims located in the Tusayan na
tional forest and within the confines
of the Grand Canyon, at the time of
the application a national monument,

claimed because the plaintiff alleged
they contained valuable deposits of
platinum.

were the United States Platinum com
panyand Charles H. Kerk, secretary
of the J. Bishop Platinum works. In
his complaint, Cameron appealed from
the decision of the local land office

THIN, FRAIL
FOLKS NEED
PHOSPHATE
Nothing Like Plain Bitro-Phosphate
to Put on Firm, Healthy Flesh and
to Increase Strength, Vigor
and Nerve Force.
Judging from the countless prepara
tions and treatments which are contin
ually being advertised for the purpose
of making thin people fleshy, develop
ing arms, neck and bust, and replacing
ugly hollows and angles by the soft
curved lines of health and beauty,
there are evidently thousands of men
and women who keenly feel their ex
cessive thinness.
Thinness and weakness are usually
due to starved nerves. Our bodies
need more phosphate than is contained
in modern foods. Physicians claim
there is nothing that will supply this
deficiency so well as the organic phos
phate known among druggists as bitro
phosphate, which is inexpensive and
is sold by J. M. Ball in Bisbee' and
most all druggists under a guar
antee of satisfaction or money back.
By feeding the nerves directly and by
supplying the body cells with the
necessary phosphoric food elements,
bitro-phosphate quickly produces a

"My little daughter Jean, has gained
ten pounds on Tanlac and now she's
the very picture of health," Bald Jim
Snell, well known poultry and truck
farmer of Raleigh, Tenn.
"When Jean was only 7 years old,"
continued Mr. Snell, "she was taken
with something like nervous stomach
trouble, and there wasn't a day or
night she didn't suffer, until we got
Tanlac for her, and she's now 15 years
old. Her stomach was In such a baa
condition she had to live on toast ana
eggs and milk, and she couldn't eat
any kind of meats or vegetables. She
complained of pains in her stomach
all the time and would spit up half di
gested food. She was nervous and
woulci toss and roll all night, for she
couldn't sleep well at all. She waa
bilious and her complexion was bad,
and she looked pale and sickly all the
time. We gave her most every kind of
medicine we could think of, but no
thing helped her.
"After hearing of some of the good
work Tanlac was doing, we got some
for Jean, and it has done wonders
for her. She actually looks and acts
like a different child, and she's .taken
only two bottles of the medicine. She
commenced picking up as aoon as she
started Tanlac, and she has gained ten
pounds. She never has indigestion
now, and eats just anything she
wants ever such things as beans and
' other vegetables, and meats of all
kinds. Why, she ate corn for dinner
yesterday, and it was the first time
in eight years she dared taste corn,
and she eats boiled bacon that's cook
ed with vegetables. She's not nervous
nor bilious now, and sleeps like a
baby, and we never hear anything out
of her from the time Bhe goes to bed
until she gets up in the mornings.
Her skin has cleared up and her
cheeks look fresh and rosy. You can
Just look at her and tell she's enjoying
good health."

Capital $300,000.00 All Common Par $10.00
Read this oil ad carefully through and think while you are reading. We have already
production whicn we have just brought in amounting to Seven Hundred Barrels a day.
Why are we still selling at par? That's what we want you to read carefully. Listen:
The Greater Texas Oil Company of Dallas organized Ninety Days ago, with a very
large programme comparatively. We had leased many pieces of property to try to get
something good and here is what we picked out for our company. . .
2 1-2 acres just three hundred yards south of the School House in the townsite of Burk
burnette, " - ' 1 '
A five'acre lease in block "72". Can you beat it? ' ? , .
A ten-acre lease in Iowa Park between the discovery Zinc and the city. ,
A fifty-acre lease in Archer county, right against the American Ace holdings. !
A five-hundred acre lease in Reeves county, which you know is beginning to look like'
very valuable property. , -. ' ' ' .
A six hundred and forty acre lease in Grimes county a wildcat, but taken only after
a thorough and ecientif ice investigation of it's possibilities. ;
First: Now since our campaign was started some six weeks ago, we have gotten two'
producing wells in Burkburnette. Ah average of 700 barrels a day.
Second: Block "72" has become the most valuable piece of acreage we possess.
Third: Iowa Park is forging ahead as the prettiest oil country in the state, for the high
est grade oil, and it is only eight hundred feet deep. Wells are producing in . twenty
days after drilling starts. t
Fourth: The American Ace is getting .20 barrel wells right along at six hundred feet,
just over the barbed wire fence from our Acher county property.
It takes fifteen days to drill here. Consider this. If we. could use the money from the
sale of the Oil we are now producing, we would not have . to sell another share of
stoc. But we guaranteed the stockholders 100 per cent of the Oil as H came in iintil
they received 100 per cent of their investment, and we are keeping our word.
WE ARE NOW AT THIS MINUTE DRILLING IN TWO PLACES ON ' OUR
BLOCK "72" PROPERTY. LOOK AT YOUR MAP.
We have, guaranteed to our stockholders thirteen wells, and in order to do that and;
do it quickly we must have more money because it takes every cent of the money.'
from the sale of stock to carry out the present drilling programme. We are going to
start five wells in Iowa Park immediately and four in Archer county. - ..-.-
There is the whole thing in as short a story as we could give it to you. Now We
have about a hundred thousand dollars worth of stock yet to sell at par We must
reserve the right to return any overscrip tion,. and we must advise you to get in and
get in quickly. Remember Block "72". Look it up on any map. Greater Texas
Oil stock is selling faster in the city of Wichita Falls than anywhere. Just think about
that a minute That's right under the gun you know.
Two wells will not be started but will be finished soon in Block "72". We are con
fident the Oil from these two wells alone will make our stock at least Five to One.
HURRY.

STOCKS AND BONDS
NEW YORK, May 22 For the
first time in several weeks .trading on
the stock exchange today was marked
by an absence of excitement and vio
lent fluctuations. Dealings were com
paratively moderate, falling consider
ably under the heavy daily totals of
last week.
The bond market participated to an
unusual extent in the day's less spec
tacular operations, various domestic
issues, notably low priced speculative
rails and several of the foreign flota
tions, denoting a confident inquiry.
Slee'.s-. especially the independent
division, were active and strong at
gains of 1 to 6 points, their advance
being accelerated by reports that the
government contemplated large orders
for rails and other equipment.
Oils were the mainstay of the early
and intermediate periods, rising two
almost 4 points and motors were re
sponsive to better trade conditions,
though easing later on heaviness on al
lied specialties, such as rubber Issues.
Metals and utilities made pronounc
ed headway .the former being featur
ed by National Lead and United
States Smelting and the latter by ex
press shares, American, Adams and
Wells Fargo gaining 6 to 14 points,
but rails, tobaccos and leathers were
Irregular. Sales amounted to 1,235,000
shares.
Liberty issues augmented the gen
eral strength of the bond market, with
local tractions. Total sales, par value,
aggregated $14,500,000. Old United
States bonds were unchanged on call.
THE GRAIN MARKETS
CHICAGO, May 22J Authoritative
opinions that the 1919 corn crop is
now two weeks late did a good deal to
offset bearish factors In the corn mar
ket. Prices closed unsettled, c net
lower to c advance, with July $1.638
to $1,631,4 and September $1.586 to
$1.58. Oats finished unchanged to
Yzc higher and provisions unchanged
to 40c down. '
Corn traders who were friendly to
the selling discovered that buying or
ders jcame into play whenever values
made a decided tip. In this connec
tion .bulls laid chief stress on a state
ment from a leading crop expert that
much corn, especially in the big sur
plus producing states, might have to
be replanted unless weather conditions
which have been too cold and wet
were changed without further delay.
Scantiness of receipts here and at
other large centers tended also to
bake harden, and No. 2 yellow for im
mediate, delivery commanded the high
est price yet this season.- On the
other hand hog quotations were sharp
ly lower and there were reports that
a cargo of Augustine jcorn coming
west by special train would cost 20c
under May contracts in Chicago de
livered. Gossip, that foreigners were buying
futures helped to give comparative
strength to oats. Provisions fell with
hogs.

the North, the earliest producer in the district. Splendid surface showing.

different from previous mining booms ths money invested in Divide stocks is going
into the ground for honest development work.
BECAUSE The stock is practically certain to double and treble in value within a few
days after it is listed on the San Francisco Exchange.
BECAUSE At fifteen cents a share it appears impossible for you to lose.
BECAUSE The officers and directors are live wires, successful business and mining
men, who do not dabble with failures.
Officers of the company are

Alfred C. Kuhn, Y. M. C. A. song
leader, who for nearly two weeks has
been organizing community sing-songs
in the Warren District, left last night
for Phoenix, where he will remain for
a dav before visiting other cities in
the state.
Mr. Kuhn said yesterday that he
deeply appreciated the reception and
many kindnesses he has received here
and praised the work of the Y. W. C
A. and Y. M. C. A. "This is one of
the strongest association towns I have
ever visited.- In fact the work repre
sents bigger responsibilities, better
results than does the Y. M. C. A. at
El Paso," said Mr. Kuhn. Mr. Kuhn's
work with the association terminates
on June 1. He will then go to his
home at Albuquerque, N. M.. to be
come pastor of the First Christian
