SPIRIT RECEffT
Allow Themselves to Be
Driven Back With Objec
tives Still Far Away; Lack
ing Initial Push
(By Review Leased Wire)
LONDON, June '.9. Reciter's
Rome correspondent says that ac
cording to report the Austrian em
peror, who is at the front, is dis
appointed at the results obtained
in the present offensive and,
jealous of the excessive credit the
Germans took for their share in
last year's offensive, is determined
to make another desperate At
tempt to overwhelm the Italians
unaided, before asking for Ger
man assistance.
The Teutonic allies apparently have
lost their spirit of do-or-die. Their at
tacks everywhere lately have lacked
the tenaciousness of days gone by.
Instead of ploughing through allied
line with stubborn indifference to cas
ualties so long as an objective was
gained, they now waver and then halt
in the -faee of the artillery and rifle
fire of the men barring their way
with the points they were trying to
gain still far beyond their reach.
Ambitious attempts by the troops
of the central powers in the past few
weeks have proven this. The opening
of a gateway to Paris through the west
ern front, running from Montdidier to
the Marne, failed completely; the
offensive on the Italian bat
tle 1 ine launched by the Au-
strians seemingly has failed miserably
in the mountain regions, and apparent
ly has almost been stopped along the
Piave, while a stroke started by the
Germans against liheims broke down
in its inception without the enemy tak
ing a yard of territory.
And in these various attempted en
terprises the high commands of the
German and Austro-Hungarian armie3
have seen their men literally mown
down until battlefields have been clog
ged with dead or wounded as recom
pense to the allied troops for the small
)its of terrain they yielded.
I The Austrian offensive in the Ital
ian theater is still in progress along
J he Piave river but in the mountain
region after the sharp reaction by the
Italians, British and French troops
who in counter attacks pushed back
the invader from the points he had
reached in his initial rush, the enemy
evidently is fearful of again trying out
the mettle of the defenders.
On the Piave numerous attempts
have been made by the Austrians to
gain further bridgeheads on the west
ern bank of the stream but the Italians
everywhere are holding them with
their gun fire and also doing sangu
inary execution within the ranks of the
enemy across the river with bombs
and machine gunfire.
The Austrian war office asserts that
the Austro-Huugarian troops have
crossed the Fossetca canal at some
points where Tuesday it was claimed
they had made advances and also that
several Italian lines at the southern
foot of the Moutella plateau, the key
to the Venetian plains, have been
pierced. Koine, on the other hand de
clared that all the weak attempts
made in the Montello region were
completely repulsed.
More than 9000 men have been tak
en by the Italians since the offensive
began and many guns and seveml hun
dred machine guns have been cap
tured. That iutensive air fighting also
has taken place is shown by the fact
that fifty enemy planes have been shot
down. Only two of the allied ma
chines have failed to return to iheir
base.
The attacks of the Germans near
Rheims resulted disastrously to th?:n.
Hardly had they left their trenches
after one of the most terrific bombard
ments with shells of all calibre includ
ing gas projectiles ever experienced
on the western front, nearly 40,000
men were faced by the reinforced
French armies and literally cut to
pieces and forced to fall back precipi
tately. Only at one point, to the east
of Rheims, did the enemy succeed in.
penetrating the French lines. Here
they were ejected almost immediately.
The German official communication
describes the attack as a demonstra
tion of artillery and mine throwers.
Little activity has prevailed on the
remainder of the western front, ex
cept the usual, reciprocal bombard
ments and operations in the nature of
patrol engagements.
The success of the recent naval at
tack by the British on the German sub
marine base at Zeebrugge seemingly
was more successful than anticipated
Twenty-one destroyers, a large num

(By Review Leased Wire)
WASHINGTON. June 19 Employes
of the war and navy departments to
day were drawn into the net set by
the department of justice for war con
tract brokers, through indictments re
turned by a federal grand jury here,
charging four men with trying to col
lect on a duplicate bill for $187,000
submitted by a dry dock company for
repairs to a government vessel. The
case does not involve fee profiteers,
but grew out of the investigation into
their practices.
The four indicted are Clyde C.
Waltman. a yoeman in the navy de
partment's bureau of supplies and ac
counts, Charles Waltman, his brother;
Benjamin W. Peake, a soldier sta
tioned! at Fort Megis, Wash., formerly
of Berea, N. C, and D. Malvin Mow
ery, a stenographer employed in the
signal corps, formerly of Lancaster,
Pa.
With free access to the navy de
partment files, Clyde C. Waltman and
Mowery were said to have obtained a
bill for $187,000, rendered by the
Morse Dry Dock and Repair company
of New York, for repairs to the gov
ernment vessel Canadaigua. After the
hill was alleged to have been taken
from the files, the company was told
it was lost and was asked to submit
a dnnlicp.te. which was paid. Before
the men presented the original bill for
payment, they were arrested.
The scheme failed, it is said, because
rn unnamed sailor who heard of tin
r.lot informed the government. All
four men have been arrested and re
leased on bail.
Definite proof of specific payments

over to the sheriff was denied today
by Judge F. A. Griffin. Granting of

Judge Griffin said the death warrant

in an effort to obtain a new trial for

LABOR ASKS RETRIAL
ST. PAUL. Minn., June 19. Resolu
tions calling upon President Wilson
and the governor of California to use
their powers to obtain a new trial for
Thomas J. Mooney were features of
the session today of the American
Federation of Labor convention.
Mooney is under sentence of death
in California for alleged participation
in a preparedness day bomb outrage
in San Francisco.
The Mooney resolution which was
passed unanimously, asserted that un
less Mooney is to go to the gallows
with the belief prevailing that his con
viction was obtained through perjured
testimony, a new trial must be given.
An appeal to the governor of Cali
fornia asks that executive to "dispel
the impression that a grave miscar
riage of Justice Is being allowed with
the knowledge of the authorities."
In an address to the convention to
day, M. Justin Godart, assitsant secre
tary of war of France and head of a
French war mission to the United
States, declared that a union of
French and American workers will be
one of the results of the conflict in

NAVY REFUSED BAD
MEAT FROM PACKERS
(By Review Leaped Wire)
NEW YORK. June 19. Men of the
American navy and the naval reserves
would have been served with great
quantities of decayed meat, but Jo- the
vigilance of inspection officers who re
jected it as unfit for humau consump
tion, according to evidence given here
today before the federal trade com
mission. The testimony was brought
out during the inquiry which the Com
mission is conducting into chnrgss
that Wilson & Co., packers, sold ''bad"
hams to the government.
Naval officers also testified h Jt the
packers had asked "exorbitant" prices
in bids to furnish hams to the na-'y,
with the result that a coinmr.ndcering
order was issued at prices fixed by
' government
After Capt. Charles Williar's. navy
pay director, had described his refusal
to accept 492,074 pounds of hflins.
which he said were "musty, mouldy,
marrow-sour or just plain sour."
Thomas K. Wilson, president of the
company , denied that his firm had ever
knowingly delivered tainted meat to
the army or navy.
The packers' testimony was supple
mented by that of Walter J. Reese and
H. Hirschfelder, agents at Philadel
phia and San Antonio, who denied
having attempted at any time to dis
pose of unsound meat to the goveri
ment. Captain Williams, who is stationed
in Brooklyn, where he directs ship
ment of food and clothing to the en
tire enlisted personnel of the navy, de
clared that "violent protests" had been
made by officers in charge of tha
Great Lakes training station near Chi

Jones' Amendment Proposing
Abolition of Booze for
Period of War Storm Center
in Nation J Capitol
WASHINGTON. June 19. President
Wilson is understood to have declined
today to interpose active opposition,
for the present at least, to the Jones
amendment to the $11,000,000 enierg-
encv agricultural annronriation bill
providisg 'or absolute prohibition dur -
ing the war.
The president is said to have taken
the position that, while he would have
preferred precipitation of the prohibi
tion question by separate legislatiou.
he wo;ild not at this time interfere in
the matter, at least so long as it does
not hold up final enactment of ;ii3
emergency agricultural bill or other
necessary legislation.
Should it interfere with such legisla
tion it is understood, the president
might step in and csk that the amend
ment be eliminated.
Senator Smith of South Carolina,
acting chairman of the senate agricul-
tural committee, the president, and
Daiabridse Colby, representing Chair-
mm Hurley of the shipping board,
conferred on the question today.
Mr. Colby told the connniliee that
to take beer away from ship yard em
ployes would reduce their efficiency
and result in a reduction of new
ship tonmj:e of about 25 per cent.
In spite oft his opposition prohibi
tion lepders expressed confidence that
the amendment would be favorably re
ported to the senate.
The opposition of the shipping board
to the amendment came as a surprls'j
to dry leaders, some of wTiom were
inclined to believe that it reflected
the attitude of the president. Mr.
Colby said he believed prohibition at
this time would prove a detriment to
the ship building industry, as many
workmen think beer drinking is u:i
harmful and is essential. He said
that despite arguments that prohibi
tion legislation is necessary for tho
conservation of food, it is advocated by
prohibitionists and not by food con
servationists. Former secretary of state B-yan
the principal witness for the prohibi
tionists told the committee he favored
absolute prohibition, but thought it
had to be brought about gradually,
instead of precipitately, as the Jones
nmendmcnt provides. He predicted
that even if the amendment Is defeated
national prohibition Is sure to come.

IMMEDIATELY ACT
UPON DRAFT BILL
New Classification Expected
to Provide 250,000 Addi
tional Men for Army;
Crowder Urges Action
(By Review Leased Wire)
WASHINGTON. June 19. With
drawal by Secretary Baker of his op
position gave fresh impetus today to
consideration of the proposal before
congress to extend the draft age limit
so that the war department will have
available at no distant date ample
man power to carry out President Wil
son's program of an army of unlimited
size for the war on Germany.
Officials in the office of Provost Mar
shal General Crowder immediately be
gan preparation of statistics showing
results which may be expected if the
! draft is extended to various ages, be
tween IS and 45 years, the limits fixed
in a bill by Senator France of Mary
land, republican. It is expected that
this information will be presented
soon to the senate military committee
which is considering the France bill.
Early reports on the results of the
reclassification of men by local boards
indicated that more than 250.000 men
will be added to class one by this
means, as against the original esti
mate of 200.000. Operation of General
Crowder's "work or fight" regulations
which become effective next July 1
also is expected to add to the total
in the first class. Each district is ex
I pected to have near the national aver
age of 2S.7 per cent of its total regis
tration in class one when the re-clasxl-fication
has been completed.
These estimate were pointed to to
day by some officials as bearing out
their contention that there is no imme
diate necessity for changing the age
limits. General Crowder. however,
does not share thi3 view, and recently
told the senate military committee
that extension of the age limits was
necessary because at the planned rate
ef calls class one would be exhausted
early next year.
Members of congress from mining
districts were informed today by Gen
eral Crowder's oft ice that there will be
no reconsideration of the decision not
to grant deferred clasilication to
miners as a class. This will leave the
matter of miners' classifications wttJi
tho local boards as heretofore and in
some quarters the decision was be
lieved to have been influenced partly,
at least, by the small number of fight
ing men left in class one.
Announcement of definite rulings on
what are to be termed vuseful employ
ment under the work or fight regula
tions is expected soon. An opinion
upon the status of baseball players is
now awaiting General Crowder' de
cision. Amplifying his statement, withdraw-
jing his opposition to extending the
j draft ages. Mr. Baker said today that
the only reason for his having hesi
tated to submit a recommendation to
congress on the subject was a desire
to learn the resulting effect upon vital
industries of the country.
The war secretary indicated that
any recommendation he makes on the

Necessarily. American Ambassador
Morgenthau was obliged to leave
Constantinople and since that time the
relations between the two govern
ments have been just short of at 'uul
formal enmity.
Recently there have been vigorous
demands in congress for a declaration
of a state of war between the United
States and Turkey and Bulgaria, but
President Wilson and the state de
partment have rt regarded thi steu
as necessary or desirable, since iher
hes been no actual collision between
American and Turkish and Bulgarian
trcops.
On the face of. the reports from
American Minister Caldwell at Teher

that the sacking of the American hos
pital, a Presbyterian institution. orr
the protest of the Spanish consul in
charge as representative of American
interests, furnished the necessary
provocation for open hostilities be
tween America and Turkey.
The advices, however, were meager
and the minister explained that he
was only transmitting reports of mjt
ters not of his own knowledge.
American doctors and nurses wh.i
have brn stationed in the hospital
were believed to have left Tabriz be

that city, reported to the department

ever, because of the peeu'iar and un
certain relations between Turkey and
Persia, the assertion by the former of
tiie right of suzerainty over Persia
and the recognized inability of the
latter to resist the Turkish troops,
there is little douht here that the
Washington government will hold that
the responsibility for the outrages has
passed to Turkey and that if the first
reports are substantiated the exi-stenc e
of a state of war between Turkey and
the United States must be declared.

Jud?e W. H. Sawtelle of Tucson, 405
foreifrn-born soldiers, natives of twen
ty different nations, this morning it
the ball park received their full citi-
lenship papers.
It was an impressive ceremony.
Seldom are men admitted fo citizen
snip unuer such inspiring circum
stances. On one side, stretched the
full length of the ball park, wore the
four regimental bands which relaed
Opposite them was a double line of
soldiers also reaching the entire
length of the rrounds. These were
the men who have heen busy the last
week in the preliminary work of be
coming citizens. To the music of
four regimenal bands which relayed
each other In furnishing music these
columns, in single fire, marched past
table placed in the middle of the
field where each mau received bi3
papers. Many civilians saw the cere
mony, which was to have been held
last night but had to be pos;noneG be
cause it was impossible to have the
men sworn in in time.
Worked Into Niqht
This operation was not completed
until 10 o'clock last night. Each man
had to take the oath of allegiance
separately. Then Judge Sawtelle
swore them in in groups, each group
being made up of the natives of one
country. This rra'le twenty groups to
be sworn in. Each man then signed
the required paper.
The court was assemWed again thi3
morning in the Armv Y. M. C. A.
building. Here General Cabell mad
the address to the men. The talk was
delivered in the language which sol
diers understand and the men liked it
immensely. At its conclusion they ap
plauded General Cabell with vigor.
General Cabell pointed out to the
men clearly what it means to become
American citizens and the grave re
SDonsibilityt that rests upon them in
.the present crisis.
' "Greater . love hath no man than
that he can lav down his life for his
country.' he said.
In taking the o?th of allegiance
last evening, a considerable number
of the soldiers with odd or urnro-
nouncable names hnd them changed to
i
, American nams. This was prirticular
ly true of Greeks. Syrians and Turks.
A Rumanian had his name change-
to Jack Morgan:
"Why didn't he do it rirht and make
it J. P. Morcan?" remarked one of
the men in khaki in the rooin.

"Thus Did'st Thou
The Vase at Soissons"
In reading of the German advance upon
Soisson3 and plunder of all that country
side and destruction of all property, this
editor is reminded of an old tale, or legend,
of ancient Soissons, that is printed as abso
lute truth by no less authority than Guizot,
in his History of France. Clovis, first king
of the Franks, wa3 camped for awhile at
Soissons, and that was some 1 500 years
ago. Now Clovis was a Christian king, and
he had in his camp certain holy relics of
the mother church at Rome, brought to him
by an embassy sent by the pope. Among
these relics was a most beautiful vase,
blessed by the pope himself. One of the
chieftains of Clovis" army, a gigantic,
uncouth, ruthless brute, of the Hunnish
rvrje. and. it mav well be. of Hunnish blood,
raiar-d riis riAttl ayp In nnrp wantonpss. one
day during a court ceremony, and smashed
this holy vase. Clovis was scarcely secure
enough on his throne then to offend this
great chief, and so he swallowed the
affront. But, some months later, safe in
his own capital, and sure of a united and
devoted nation, as a result of his wife and
strong rule, Clovis at a similar court cere
mony to the one at Soissons, called this
chieftain before his throne and then rose
up to his full heighth and struck him life
less at his feet with his battle axe. "Thus
did'st thou the vase at Soissons," exclaimed
Clovis as he struck the mighty blow. "Thus
did'st thou the vase at Soissons," General
Foch will one dav sav to the Hun when
the allied armies have reached their full
strength, and Foch, like Clovis, long pas
sive under wrong and biding his time,
judges that the time has come to strike.
And the result will be the same as it was
in Clovis' court that day when the bar
barian fell, a lifeless lump of cjay before
the shining axe.
A FUNNY THING'
"A funny thing happened in Everett,
Washington," according to a letter written
by Herbert Mahler of Chicago, one of the
defendants in the I. V. W. trial now in
progress at the lake metropolis and read
before Judge Landis at a recent session of
the court. The "funny thing" was what
happened after the owner of a certain box
factory in the state of Washington became
actively a leader of the vigilantes. A quo
tation from the letter says:
"He was a chesty guy until Sunday
night. He owned a box factory worth
$50,000. He isn't so chesty now, as all he
owns is an ash pile that is worth about 50
cents. 'Vengeance is mine, saith the Lord.'
I am going down to join the Holy Rollers,
as God is with us, the oppressed; or pos
sibly it was the cat."
Writing to C. L. Lambert, George Speed
and W. D. Haywood from Everett, .Mahler
told of a so-called labor fight going on
there, saying:
"The fight will continue 'a la cat. Would
have wrecked the jail but the sheriff gave
permission to speak. This fight is just the
beginning of the attempt tq drive the I. W.
W. out of the lumber industry.
"We must win at any cost and give this
burg such a whipping that no others will
want to start anything with us. We need
men ar.d money-as the fight will not be
easy. Any of th boy3 who are footloose
can be used here but we expect to get most
of our men from the harvest fields."
RAILROAD IMPROVEMENT
Henry . Clews, he New York banker,
sums up the railroad situation as follows:
"Not a few light, power and local trans
portation issues are selling ai exceedingly
low prices, and dividends have often been
imperilled, if not impaired, by the advance
in wage and other expenses, while charges
for service remained unchanged. It is not
unlikely that a turn for the better is at hand,
because the action of the federal govern
ment in regard to the railroads was a signifi
cant example, and will no doubt hasten ad
vances in charges for gas, electricity, street
. railway fares, etc., in compensation for the
increased cost of doing business. The
national railroads are marking steady prog
ress. Better gross earnings are often re
ported, and net returns are guaranteed by
the government.
"The administration has also made lib
eral preparation for necessary improve
ments and equipment, having authorized
expenditures of $946,000,000 during 1918,
of which $206,000,000 will be for freight
cars. $199,000,000 for locomotives, $38,
for bridges, trestles, etc., $31,000,000 for
rails and tracks. $62,000,000 for shops.
$98,000,000 for yards and sidings. $47.
000,000 for main tracks, $28,000,000 for
passenger cars and $22,000,000 for sta
tions, not to speak of a hos'; of other out
lays. Such vast expenditures, necessitated
by prolonged starvation, mean intense ac
tivity in the steel industry fcr many months
to come. Railroad shares have in conse
quence shown decided steadiness and not
a little strength at times. The market for
industrials has, however, been somewhat
spotty; increased expenses and heavy taxes
having in not a few instances materially
affected dividend paying properties.
"The question of taxation is still a seri
ous problem One-third of the cost of war
is apparently to be paid out of taxes and
these are to be doubled. There is general
willingness to meet this great additional
burden ; but there is nevertheless much crit
icism concerning the injustices and confu
sion of the present law; also a fear that
unless the new taxes are judiciously ap
plied, they will dry up the sources of rev
enue and new capital. For some reason
there is much distrust in the competence of
congress to draw up a fair and effective
measure and much more confidence is
exhibited in Secretary McAdoo's proposals,
severe as they seem to be."
Austrian socialists are very bitter now
against Philip Scheidemann, leader of the
German socialists, for refusing to support
them in their revolutionary movement
against the house of Austria when the
latter decided to continue the war to the
bloody end at any cost. But what did these
Austrain socialists expect of Scheidemann ?
He is Emperor Wilhelm's tool in all things
that affect the house of Hohenzollern, else
he would not be permitted to live in Ger
many. He TALKS socialism but he ACTS
autocracy. He, as well as most of the Ger
man socialistic leaders, are merely stool
pigeons for the German militarist party.
They encourage and aid a Bolshevik in
Russia or any radical uprising in Italy or
England or an I. W. W. in the United
States, BUT IT DOES NOT GO IN GER
MANY! These Austrian dupes had plenty
of evidence regarding Scheidemann long
before he threw them down, but they
would not see it.
"The eagles in France feel only con
tempt for the vultures at home, but do not
fear them." These ringing words, cabled
by Captain Harry Wheeler, now an Amer
ican soldier in France, is the brave little
ex-sheriff's answer to the wobblies and poli
ticians and agitators who have been yelp
ing so loud lately about the Bisbee depor
tation. As for the responsibiltiy of that
act, the captain assumes it himself, and
speaks of it with pride and declares that he
would, under the same circumstances, do
the same thing again. I le will come home,
he says, when the war is over, if he is still
alive, and gladly and proudly stand with
his friends to "undergo any tribulation the
politicians and I. W. W. sympathizers can
inflict."
If you are inclined to complain about
your ice bill down here in the desert these
hot days, stop and consider the case of the
Chicago consumer. At least 70 per cent
of the ice used in the great northern metro
polis is natural ice, and yet the price for it
is 50 cents per hundred, just the same as
for the artificial ice. An investigation de
veloped the fact that it cost 60 cents per
ton to cut and store natural ice. And yet
it retails for $10 a ton. Pretty nice little
profit in this game.
Douglas International: Representative
Francis, of this county, was one of the
members in the legislature, who fought the
measure introduced and intended to prevent
idling and loafing in the state. The bill is
a good one and when enforced will prevent
the wobblies from herding in any industrial
center for the purpose of stirring up trouble
and strife between the honest workmen and
their employers.
Legislative Gossip
(Sjwlul to The Review!
j There had been expectation o an
:a-ljour.imcnt yesterday and many :'
Iths members had made plan for flit
ting by night, most of them by auto.
In the morning only four bills re
maiaed on the senate calendar and
i only a couple on that of the home.
I Hut there came lack of agreement.
witlv a bit of hard talk in the house
ci.neeriiing the cavalier way in which
the senate had been ditching liou-e
bills. Finally, around 5 p. in. it be
came evident that even a night session
would not accomplish the result sought
and so the adjournment was till 'J this
morning.
The day would have been the final
one had there not come deadlock over
the way in which the soldiers' vote
should be counted. In the senate was
being held a house bill. No. 3, in which
registration was abolished and the
election was placed wholly in the
hands of the, county supervisors, for
the benefit of simplicity. The senate
substituted another measure of radi
cally different sort, on the basis of
Colter's senate bill No. 1, rather cen
tralizing the administration of the vot
ing machinery. This bill roused ire In
the house and promptly was indefinite
ly postponed, with a few remarks from
members concerning the superior
character of their own measures in
the hands of the senate ehief clerk.
Representative Goodwin's claim that
the senate had acted for political reas
ons, to advance the claims of a cer
tain candidate, seems to have had
some effect on the rejection vote of
seventen to twelve, for in the twelv
were included the administration fac
tion of the democracy. On receipt of
the news, the senate proceeded to in
sert its own measure for the body of
house bill three and to send it back to
the house which again rejected it. The
senate offered the oliVe branch by ap
pointment of a conference committee
and the houso followed suit this morning.

Tho hr.nsuv In tho eleventh hour, kill
ed the senate dairying bill, leaving
th:.f unction of the Governor's call with
out consideration. There had been
acquiescence in a request of the l'a
Hfie Creamerv company for elimina
tion of a paragraph calling for tho
weighing and testing oi miia ai uir
farms, from which it is gathered daily
in this valley on hundreds of miles
of motor truck routes. When final vote
was taken, there was sudden opposi
tion from Greene of Maricopa, himself
a farmer, who did not like the plan oi
turning over the product of nearly
40,000 cows to the direction of a sin
gle man. Foster offered a suggestion
that the matter go to the counr ll of
defense, with a 1 12,000 appropriation,
but this was not favored. Itecona '.dela
tion was moved.

For a while there appeared i pros
pect that all Americanization e.toit
woud be left in the hands of the now
council of defense, with an appropria
tion of S3000 for investigation if the
educational needs of the state. The
senate in the morning had refused to
agree with the house in amendments
made, la the afternoon, however,
Hutherford managed to get the nat
ter reconsidered and the bill passed
as amended. It provides irgnt scnooio,
with an appropriation of $25,000, to
lie handled by the state superintendent
of public instruction. There is no
limit cn the amount any one county
may receive under the appropriut;c:i.
Rather unexpectedly, the senate
passed the vagabond bill, sponsored at
urst by Eddy in the house, where its
father eventually voted against its
passage. There was objection lrom
Doth sides of the "two schools of
thought." The socialistic end disliked
any degree of compulsion on employ
ment, while the conservatives object

strike and that which aemanued top

clearly is unconstitutional and cannot
be enforced.
The governor "came through" very
promptly with his signature on the
council of defense bill, though there
had been speculation over w hetln r ho
would sign it at all or would let it be
come a law by time expiration. It in
understood he thought the bill no.
what it should be, a view held tisc;
by Senator Wilk.nson.. who voieu
against it. and by Chairman Uwight U.
Heard ct the present council, who Mad
uiged upon the legislature adoption ot
the plans of the council ot imljn.il
defense. So now there is a prosix.-L-t
that the new council of sixteen nu m
bers will have organization wit.iin n
few weeks. Any delay there may liv vill
come through the failure or the super
visors to do their part of the naming
of the membership. All the boards oi
supervisors meet during the first veek
of July, in regular quarterly session.
The governor also signed the .Marsli
auto confiscation law. Concerning this,
iheie was intimation that Senator
Rutherford, representing a county
wherein prohibition never was popular
and where the supervisors have re
fused to pay the bill of a prohibition
detective force, had a deep design
against the law when he ottered an
amendment making the buyer eqv.iliy
guilty with the seller. This provision,
now in the law forbidding the sale of
tobacco to minors, is said to be re
sponsible for the practical failure ot
the statute. The dealer, under the
Rutherford plan, would be sate from
the te: tnnoi:y of the purchaser and the
use of detectives would hiV : to lie
eliminated.

GRAIN MARKET
CHICAGO, June 19 Hot weather
and drought impairing the promise of
a record breaking crop of oats had a
conspicuous part today in forcing
sharply higher prices on grain. The
close was strong with corn up 1T to
27c net. at $$1.43" to $1.46: July,
11.47". Augusct oats gained to 3c
and provisions 20 to 65 cents.
Oats took the leadership away irom
corn, both as to volume of business
and as to upturnR in value. The prin
cipal bullish factor was the govern
ment weekly report, which showed ac
tual damage had been done in Kansas,
Missouri and Montana and that rain
was needed in some of the central
states. Reactions proved unimportant
and the market closed at the topmost
of any of the day.
Corn . sympathized with the advice
en Oats, although no injury to corn
was mentioned in the government advices.
Provisions rose with grain, despite
weakness of hogs.

mining proposition connected with it.
tut there is also a resort hotel propo
sition that will undoubtedly come out
of it that promises to become a most
wonderful asset for Arizona and that
is the construction and operation of
a large hotel of the better class for
tourists and local traffic. The mere
fact that the company is now building
a road on a 10 per. cent scale that
will be seven miles long and can be
used by trucks and motor cars of all

and the almost certain venture of a
modern hotel built of pine logs on

K
El
ETffltY
AD
(By Review Leased Wire)
PARIS, June 19. Because of the in
creasing number of American soldiers
In France end the increasing decree
of American participation in the war.
the government has decided to' create
a new secretaryship for Franco-Amor-ican
war co-operation. Tlie new de
partment, which will form part of the
premier's office, will be headed by
Capt. Andre Tardieu, who, however,
will remain as French hieh commis
sioner to the United States. He will
divide his time between Taris and
Washington.
Premier Clemenceau sent this after
noon to President Poincaire the follow
ing letter with the draft o a decree
wWh. when signed, will be effective
tomorrow :
"The development of Franco-American
war co-operation makes it nere
sary to give thorough unity of dtrwo
tion to all measures looking to its com
pletion this as well in France as in
the United States. ,
"The creation in 1917 of a high com
mission of the French government at
Washington has assured this unity of
direction for all matters to be set
tled in the United States. A central
'. office of Franco-American a'fairs has
since December, 1917. and under the
direction of the- undersecretaries of
the prime minister's office, has under
its care certain questions to be treated
itf France.
"Just now the American forces are
increasing considerably, and a continu
ous increase is expected in the next
few months. These' considerations
have led me to the idea that the cen
tralization of efforts is necessary and
that it is expedient to strengthen still
further the direction of our co-operation
with the United States, in plac
ing in the same hands the bulk of the
questions concerned. If you approve
of my point of view I have the honor
to ask you to si?n the following de
cree: " 'First: There shall be at the prime
minister's office a secretaryship for
Tranco-American 'war co-oneratioi.
" 'Second. The secretarv for Franco
American war co-operation is com
missioned to bring to its maximum
efficiency war co-operation between
the United States and France. We
will have the authority to obtain to
that effect from every eovernment de
partment or service all measures to
co-ordinate the work of military pre
paredness accomplished in the United
States with the execution of the work
carried otrt in France; to supply all
the needs of the American forces in
France as well as French needs in the
United States; to establish and follow,
in accord wih the American govern
ment, and especially toward neutral
countries, the policy of the interallied
agreements, and to supply all alliel,
neutral or enemy countries -with infor
mation concerning Franco-American
co-operation. He shall execute all de
cisions on the above matters, refer
ring when needed to the prime min
ister. " 'Third: To fulfill the objects of
this mission, the secretary for Franco
American war co-operation has at his
disposal (1) the services of the high
commission of the French republic at
Washineton and New York; (2) the
centra offices of Frnr.co-American af
fairs organized by the decision of De
camber 19. 1917; (3) the American
department o missions office; (4) I
French missions with the Americans J
in the interior zone. . J
" 'The general in chnree of Ameri- J
can affairs with the generil-in-cniT or
the allied armies shall act as head of
the military department of the secre
tary for Franco-American war co-operation
:
'"Fourth: The organization of the
secretary's office shall be settled by
later decision.' "
Nothing definite is known about the
organization of the new bureau, ex
cept that Vaptain Tardieu will be in
fhnnro Ho w1l take iin his new
auarters as soon as he selects his !
staff, which will include at least one
American liason officer.

AUSTRIA
NEARING
BREAKING POINT
(By Review Leased Wire)
AMSTERDAM, June 19. Matters iu
Austra are rapidly approaching thi
breaking point. The Vienna Arbeiter
Vseitung says that representatives of
the government-owned mines, printing
works, mint, telegraph and posts se
cured an audience with the premier,
L'r. Von Scydler, and the finance min
ister. Dr. Von Vinner, on Friday.
Deputy Gloeckel, acting as spokes
man for the men said, the lowering of
the workers' efficiency was attribut
able, not to ill-will but entirely to
under-feeding and that the state em
ployes needd an increase In wages of
50 per cent in order to live at all.
Dr. Von Vinner replied that the ut
most limit of expense already had
been reached and that the state couid
not possibly bear a heavier burden.
All he could promise was "further
decision" next fall.
The Arbeiter Zeitung in a heavily
consored article, speaks of dire dis
tress outside of Vienna and in places
w;here war industries have been es
tablished. In many communities it
says, the people have had no potatoes
for four months and that no fats or
flour have been distributed. Children
are going to school hungry. In one
place near Vienna bread supplies suf
ficient for two days are supposed to
last for a whole week. The news
paper complains of the paucity of sup
plies from Ukraine. The rest of the
article was censored.

BRITISH JACK KNIFE
WEAPON OF AIL USES
BEHIND ERITISH LINES IN
FRANCE, May 13. (Correspondence of
The Associated Press) Every soldier
in the British army In France is pro
vided by the government, as part of
his overseas kit, with a jack-knife.
The military jack-knife is built for
Kervire If ban nn v Ihrpo narta a
Diaae ot biietneia steel, a can-opener, !
and a "marlin-spike." The whole thing
clasps into a solid steel or bone han
dle four inches long, which is provid
ed with a ring so that it can be hung
to the belt.
The can-opener is an indispensable
part of the provision for a
soldier's
well-being at the front. Several im
portant items of his daily menu are
supplied to him in sealed cans.
The Sheffield blade has numerous
uses too obvious to need attention, but,
it Is noticeable that Tommy Atki'us
frequently uses it for purposes of eat
ing in preference to the table knife in
bis kit.
Tho knife-bladn is ulso used , con
stantly as a wood-cutter. In the
trenches the lighting of a brazier is
frequently a difficult operation owing
to the vital necessity of avoiding
smoke. The Germans have a strong
antipathy to smoke, and the sight ot
it rising from the British trenches
arouses In them disturbing evidences
of envy, hatred, malice and uncharita
blrness. It is well, therefore, to avoid
smoke. So the v.rod for the brazier
must be split up into thin sticks and
shavings, and for this purpose the of
ficial jack-knire is the ideal instrument
. When the soldier is withdrawn from
the trenches it is his first duty to
make himself and his belongings clean
and presentable for inspection. Tom

greatly puzzled by the marlinspike at-!
tachment which they found on every I
British prisoner's jack-knife. They i
made great caoital out of a storv that '
it was used to souse out the eyes ot
German wounded. In the offirial re-:
port of the l.ritish Prisoners of War '
Commission, several instances of this j
fable are recorded. j
Captain Beaman testified before the
commission that he was berated by a ''
German colonel fr permitting his men .
to use their marlinspikes on the eyes
of German wounded. Captain Browne
told the commission of listening to a
1'hlan major who was giving a lecture
and vho exhibited a liritish Jack-knife
showing the marlinspike attachment,
and describing it. as u'jd fnr torturing
German prisoners'. The srory appears
to hay been delihera'ely rooked up
by tho German military authorities for
the consumption of their troops'. '

small mongrel from a terrible
death. The deg becomes his ever
lasting friend and together they
wander off.
When night overtakes thei.t, tha
pound of music from a nearby dance

at once decides to ciiter, and there
upon conies face to face with a
sweet, innocent girl trying to suc

the unfortunate Charlie, :i!id a new
