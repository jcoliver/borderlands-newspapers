PRESIDENT WILL BE CONSULTED
BEFORE SENATE
FUTURE POLICY
Senator Fall and Hitchcock Selected to Discuss Mexican
Situation, Admittedly Critical, With President Wilson
Today; Dr. Grayson Gives Permission for Inter
view; Secretary Lansing Says Administration
Is Prepared for Any Emergencies
WASHINGTON, Dec. 4. StepB to
obtain a personal interview with
President Wilson before framing a
senate policy in the strained rela
tions with Mexico were decided on
today by the foreign relations com
mittee. The decision was made after Sec
retary Lansing had appeared before
the committee and, it was said by
members, had discloaed that because
of the president's illness, he had not
been consulted by the state depart
ment in its handling of the recent
developments which have brought
relations between the two (govern
ments to a serious stage.
At the White House tonight, the
president's physician. Dr. Grayson,
said he saw no reason why the com
mittee's representatives, if they ur
gently desired it, could not see the
president tomorrow. It was indicat
ed that the two members selected.
Senators Fall. Republican. New Mex
ico, and Hitchcock, Democrat, of Ne
braska, would endeavor to do so.
In deciding .to take its problem di
rect to the president, the committee
divided along party lines, six Repub
licans voting for the proposal and
five Democrats opposing it. The ac
tion came at the end of a day of dis
cussion of Senator Fall's resolution,
which would ask the president to
withdraw diplomatic recognition of
the Carranza government.
.It was said by Republican mem-,
bcrs that although the committee did
not discuss In detail the extent to
which the president's illness might
Cummins Concludes
Three-Day Talk On
His Railroad Bill
WASHINGTON, Dec. 4. After
speaking three days, Senator Cum
mins, chairman of the interstate
commerce committee, concluded late
today a detailed explanation of his
railroad bill, designed to meet condi
tions wit hthe return of the roads to
private ownership and control.
Discussing the anti-strike provision
of the measure, as proposed by the
committee, Senator Cummins de
clared "there had been an industrious
effort to misrepresent the bill. He
denied that it interfered in any way
with railway employes or officials
who desired to quit work.
Emphasizing that he was not op
posed to labor organizations. Senator
Cummins said the committee, insert
ing the anti-strike section, felt that
"the civilization of America cannot
continue or endure unless organized
society can find some plan to pre
serve industrial peace and order."
President Wilson's message to
congress Tuesday, he declared, was
a direct endorsement of the proposed
legislation.
AMBASSADOR B0NILLAS DENIES
HE OR MEXICAN CONSULS IN
U.S. SPREAD RED PROPAGANDA
WASHINGTON, Dec. 4. Denial of charges by Senator Fall that he had at
tempted to spread Bolshevist propaganda in this country was made tonight by
Mexican Ambassador Bonlllas, who declared that he "had not at any time done
anything to foster, encourage or aid, actively or passively, directly or indi
rectly, any of the disturbing elements referred to, either in the United States
or Mexico."
Ambassador Bonillas said his government not only did not wish to
foment disorder in the United States or spread radical doctrine, but had
taken energetic steps to prevent its spread in Mexico. The ambassador's
statement follows: ,
"I have been informed, through the press, of the accusation made by
Senator Fall before the United States senate to the effect that this embassy
and some consulates, with the knowledge and approval of the president of
Mexico, have endeavored to stir seditious acts in this country and have been
engaged in anarchistic or Bolshevik! or I. W. W. propaganda.
"Senator Fall's charges greatly surprised me, for the hurtfulness of
them must be obvious to all. Fortunately, I have great reliance in the sound
judgment and high sense of honor of the American senate and of the Ameri
can people, and therefore I cannot believe that these false- and Injurious
accusations will be seriously considered for one moemnt
"I hav been the ambassador of Mexico and residing In Washington as
such for two years and eight months, and I have not, during that time or at
any other time, done anything to foster, encourage or aid, actively or pas
sively, directly or indirectly, any of the disturbing elements referred to either
in the United States or Mexico. By disturbing elements, I refer to the Bov
cheviki, anarchists, and the I. W. W., and I have no knowledge of this being
done by any of our consular or other agents of the Mexican government."

I have interfered with the discharge
- of his duties, the point was brought
j out that should the Mexican, situation
continue to become more critical
some question as to the executive's
physical capability might result. j
In opposing the request for an in
terview the Democrats are iu.ler
stood to have based their' arguments
on a statement to the committee by
Secretary Lansing, who was said to
have declared that the administration
was carrying out a well defined pol
icy of dealing vigorously with Mexico
and to have questioned the wisdom
of any precipitate action at this time.
The decision to take a more decisive
attitude against invasion of American
rights in the southern republic, Mr.
Lansing was quoted as saying, was
reached some months ago and now
it was about to develop, whether the
Carranza regime would accept or dis
regard It. He was said to have added
that the administration was prepared
to go to whatver length necessarj to
enforce that policy.
Neither the secretary nor the ad
ministration senators, however, were
reported as expressing directly any
opposition to the " Fall resolution.
Several attempts to postpone action
on it came from the Democratic side,
and Senator Hitchcock, acting Dem-.
ocratic leader of the senate, suggest
ed a substitute by which the senate
merely would endorse the Plate de
partment's course In the matter and
declare In advance Its support of the
president Bhould he decide to break
off diplomatic relations.

Shortage of Sugar
In Phoenix Is
Very Acute
PHOENIX, Ariz., Bee. 4, News
paper inquiries today indicated
that three fourths of the Phoenix
stores had no sugar for sale at all
and that wholesale stocks were ex
hausted. The remaining one fourth
of the retail stores were putting
very small supplies 'out for sale
each morning and a rush of buyers
took these in the early hours. The
condition was said to be rather
general in central Arizona and
there was no hope for relief before

FOIL BANDITS
Guards Preceding Auto Carry
ing $15,000 Pay Roll of El
Tigre Mine in Mexico
Drive Off Masked Men
DOUGLAS, Ariz., Dec. 4. Two par
ties of federal troops were reported
tonight in Agua Prieta to be in pur
suit of four masked bandits who this
morning about 5 o'clock attempted to
hold up the stage bound for El Tigre
mine, with $15,000 in American gold
and currency aboard. One of three
mounted guards riding ahead of the
stage, a private in the Mexican fed
eral army, was killed and another,
Capt. Pedro Garcia, was shot in the
hand. The stage, with three other
federal soldiers in it, -was a consider
able distance in the rear, concealed
from the view of the bandits by a
turn in the road. The unwounded
guard, fighting from behind his
horse, held the 'four, masked men at
bay while Captain Garcia rode Dack
to get assistance. As the three sol
diers left the stage and came forward'
on the run, the bandits fled over the
hills in a northerly direction.
Parties had been started out from
Agua Prieta to intercept the men
should they make an effort to cross
the border. The body of the dead
soldier was taken to Esqueda and
Captain Garcia was brought to Agua
Prieta to have his wound treated.
The payroll money was sent from Es
queda to El Tigre later' In the day.
It Is not known whether the robbers
were Mexicans or Americans, al
though it is rumored that they were
Americans. Only a month ago a de
serter from the American forces sta
tioned on the bo ei.rdrn company with
a half breed Mexican, robbed the
warehouse of El Tigre mine at -Esqueda.
They were apprehended after
a few hours, and last week were tried
and sentenced. The American was
sentenced to serve eleven years in
prison and the half breed seven years,
according to local report.

He admitted today that false en
tries had been made in the fiscal
agency books of the company, to
show his income to be less than it
really was.
"I did this to cover any chance
losses which might occur." he ex:
plained, "such as the theft of money
by a stock salesman or the like."
He was again Questioned about the
transaction of May SI. 1918, whereby
he was to receive 100,000 shares of
tha company stock at half of the sell
ing value.
"Is it true you told a federal trade

in this arrangement?" asked Attor
ney Ben Epstein for the prosecution.
"Yes. it may have been true," re
plied Pandolfo. ,

eggs and poultry uid dealers in and
manufacturers of butter, cheese,
oleomargarine, condensed milk and
like products, catsup and condiments

congress, also were issued against
the United Dressed Beef company,
the Western Meat company of San
Francisco, and the Nevada Packing
company.
Instances cited by the complaints
of concerns over which the Chicago

JOHNSON AND WOOD ALMOST

DISPLAY SLIGHT INTEREST
Filled-in coupons continued to pour into the Review political editor yes
terday, and at the end of the day the Warren district voters had almosft
brought the race between Hiram Johnson and General Leonard Wood, in
the Review's straw vote contest, to a tie. Only a few votes separated the
two Republican favorites, the California senator being slightly in the lead:
Democrats are apparently . not as interested as the Republicans, judging
from the small number of votes cast for potential presidential candidates
of that party. Of the few votes cast by Democrats in this district William
McAdoo and President Wilson received the majority, the present chief tx
ecutive being a alight favorite.'
The lack of interest In the vote displayed by the local Democrats i
explained by one member of the party as being due to the uncertainty ct
who will be the national selection should President Wilson refuse to run
again. It is mainly for this reason the uncertainty as to who will be the
most popular candidate that the Review inaugurated the straw vote. Whilo
this district is not a deciding factor in national politics, the final results

presidential election, and it behooves every voter in the district to get busy

action of th supreme court when
that court dismissed the appeal upon
motion of Attorney General Jones.
There is nothing left for Torres in the
courts of the state to save him from
the noose, and should he hang, he will
be the first to meet capital punish
ment since the people voted back that
method of execution in- 1918.
There has been a misunderstanding
among the Mexican population as to
the Torrez case, the attorney general
said, and that he wished to clear up
the matter.
"Torrez is not a Mexican except in
blood," he said. "He is an American
citizen, born in Arizona. His father
was born in New Mexico and his
grandfather was a citizen of New
Mexico, and therefore an American
citizen. Torrez was in prison until a
short time before he killed Deputy
Sheriff Melick at Williams. We had
permitted him to go on parole. He
killed the deputy May 31 last."
Mrs. Mary Powell, who occupies a
room at the hotel Just over the lobby,
.heard an argument between Roessler
and another man at 2 o'clock yester
day morning. The voices quieted
down and there was no sound from
below until more than an hour later,
when Mrs. Powell heard the loud talk
ing resumed. Shortly afterward the
shots were fired.
Movie Serials Outdone When
McNeal Officers Give Chase
, To Two Alleged Bootleggers
After a chase that would have been
a "thriller" even in a serial movie.
Constable Hal Smith and Jud Kelly,
of McNeal, captured P. W. Wells and
wife, alleged bootleggers, yesterday
afternoon about a mile from McNeal.
The chase started at Webb, where
the officers have had the Wells' home
under suspicion for several weeks,
and when Wells and his wife started
to town yesterday afternoon in their
automobile, the two officers followed
them in a light roadster. Wells ap
parently became suspicious and when
a good stretch of highway was leach
ed, "opened up" his throttle and left
the two officers in the lighter car far
behind. Near the city limits of Mc
Neal the fugitive attempted to pass a
loaded wagon and In making the de
tour his car skidded and crashed into
the heavy vehicle. The crash wreck
ed both wagon and automobile, and
when Smith and Kelly, who had been
wishing their small car to its utmost
speed, arrived, they found Wells and
the teamster engaged in an angry con
troversy as to who was to blame for
the collision.
In a ditch at the side of the road
the officers found a five gallon keg
, of bootleg whiskey .the top of which
Jiad been smashed in. Near it were
several broken demijons which also
had contained raisin whiskey, they
said.
Wells and his wife were taken back
to Webb and their home searched for
a still. Failing to find any evidence
of such apparatus in the house the of
, f icers brought Wells and his wife
i back to McNeal, where they were

Decision to lease he old Hodgson'
house in Howell avenue, opposite the
Copper Queen hoiel, us a permanent
headquarters, endorsement of boxing
in Arizona, endorsement of the Red
Cross Christmas Seal campaign, and
election of a new vice post comman
der, were among the important ac
tions taken by L. E. Engle, Jr., post
of the American Legion at its regular
meeting in Maze hall last evening,
which was attended by move than
200 ex-service men, and proved one
of the most interesting and busiest
seasons held since the local post was
organized.
The meeting was called to order
shortly after 8 o'clock by Post Com
mander Dan Aangius, and began with
the reading of a formidable array of
communications, to which the as
sembled soldiers listened in solid
comfort while the cigars and cigar
ettes were passed around.
The first communication was from
Colonel Epes Randolph of Tucson,
head of the Red Cross Christmas Seal
drive in the state .asking the sup
port and public endorsement of the
Legion in the move to raise funds
through the tale of seals with which
to fight tuberculosis. It was stated
in thecomniunication that $6,500,000
is the quota to be raised by the na
tion in the sale of seals, of which
Arizona's quota is $75,000. The Le
gion unanimously endorsed the sale,
and pledged the support of its mem
bers. A communication was read from
Governor Thomas E. Campbell com
mending the L. A. Engle post for the
passage off resolutions Jeondemning
the I. W. W. murders of ex-service
men during an Armistice day parade
in Centralia, Wash.
Telegrams sent by Colonel John
C. Greenway, delegate of L. A. Engle
post to the national convention of
the American Legion in Minneapolis,
were read, informing the local post
ot the progress of the convention.
The resolutions adopted by the na
tional convention, condemning radi
calism, urging deportation of aliens,
and advocating other principles of
Americanism, also w ere read.
A communication was received
from the revenue department staling
that dances and other public social
entertainments given by posts of the
Legion are not exempt from war tax.
Another from Washington specified
the clothing equipment which ex
service men are allowed to retain
after discharge.
Prof. E. Q. Snider, chairman of the
committee on a permanent home far
the L. A. Engle post, reported that
the Thelps -' Dodge corporation,
through General Manager G. H. Dow
ell, had agreed to give the Legion a
five-year lease on the old Hodgson
house, with option for renewal of
the lease, at a rental of $50 a month.
Chairman Snider and other members
of the committee urged acceptance
of the proposal, as the Hodgson
house is centrally located, and Mr.
Dow-ell had stated that the. Legion
might remodel it to suit its conveni
ence. It was stated that the exten
sive grounds of the building could
be used f'v social purposes during
the spring, summer and fall months.
It was also pointed out that sub-rental
of certain rooms at the top of the
building would make the building
self-supporting. Establishment of a
kitchen in the place was advocated,
lor the brewing of "mulligans." and
the furtherance of an informal, so
cial "get-together" atmosphere at the
meetings of the post. It was also
proposed to construct steps leading

from the building into Main street.
The recommendation of the com
mittee was unanimously adopted, and
the executive commiitee of the post
wus. empowered to sign the lease at
once. Mr. Dowell, members of the
committee reported, stated that the
Lesion might take possession of the
building January 1.
A resolution endorsing the boxing
game as conducted in Arizona, and
opposing repeal of the present law
permitting ten round boxing in this
state, was unanimously passed. The
resolution included a provision that
copies of it should be sent to Gover
nor Campbell, in view of his recent
pronouncement against boxing, and
to every post cf the American Legion
within the state. The resolution
commended the boxing game as a
manly sport which had been of great
moral and physical benefit to the
service men in all camps and at the
front during the war, and declared
that the game had been conducted in
a clean and sportsmanlike manner
in Arizona under the ten-round state
boxing bill.
It was reported by the employment
committee that the Copper Queen
branch of the Phelps-Dodge corpora
tion here has given employment to
over 600 soldiers since the first of
the year, over 300 of whom were new
men; and that all other mining com
panies in the district had been em
playing in' proportion. Ex-service
men were always given preference in
employment by all the mining com
panies. It was pointed out, however,
that conditions in the copper market
are unusually slack at present, and
members of the committee suggested
that other posts of the Legion
throughout the state and elsewhere
be notified by letter that it is not
advisable to send ex-service men
here looking for work in the mines.
A good many, it was said, had been
coming to the district recently with
this expectation.
Commender Angius stated that he
had come in contact with a number
of ex-service men . who said they
were willing to work on the streets
here during the present paving work,
but were unable to get jobs. He said
he w-ould take the matter tip with
the city authorities, to see if there
were not some street jobs available
for them
Tj recommendation of the execu
tive committee that Tom Connors be
named to the post of vice post com
mander was unanimously accepted by
the men of the post, and Mr. Connors,
after a brief speech, took his seat
beside Commander Angius, amid ap
plause. The Armistice Day committee re
ported a surplus of something over
$187 on the day. Over $1400 was
taken in at the boxing bouts in War
ren Park, but the expenses were
within $67 of the total receipts.
A communication was received
from the Douglas post of the Legion,
asking for a series of three basket
ball games, the first to be played
in Bisbee, second in Douglas and the
place for the third to be decided by
toss of coin. As L. A. Engle post has
no basketball team, the matter vas
referred to the athletic committee,
to decide whether a team shall be
organized or not.
Commander Angius announced that
the football season is over, and asked
that football suits be turned in to
him. for U9e again rlext season.
The finances of the post were re
ported in good condition, with nearly
$500 in the treasury. "

A THOUGHT FOR THE DAY
"Truth, crushed to earth, shall rise again
The eternal years of God are hers;
But Error, wounded, writhes with pain,
And dies among his worshippers."
William Cullen Bryant.
AN ALL-IMPORTANT MEETING
TOMORROW in Phoenix will be formed the state brganization or
the United Americans, the new patriotic body which has lor
its purpose the presenting of a united front or Americanism
against the I. W. W., the Bolshevik, the anarchist and the
whispering sympathizers, with such. Delegates will be present at
this meeting from all parts of the state. It is to be hoped that the
meeting 1s the largest and most harmoniously enthusiastic ever held
in Arizona. Every Bisbee delegate recently named by the local
bn.nch of the United Americans should make it his business to at
tend, even if considerable sacrifice is entailed in so doing. The
stigma of I. W. W. doctrine has more than once been felt in Arizona,
although the state has on each occasion indignantly repudiated the
intruders. Now is -the time for Arizona to show to the world, through
tho Btfcte organization meeting of the United Americans in Phoenix,
that the citizens of this state stand unitedly against all efforts to
ward disloyal radicalism within this state's borders.
RED CROSS SEALS
FOR health, for happiness, buy Red Cros Seals! This is the
slogan of the Red Cross in its annual Christmas Seal sale,
through which the "greatest mother of them all" is conducting
its annual war against tuberculosis. And it is a shibboleth
which is particularly applicable to this state.
Though Bisbee is remarkably free from tuberculosis patients,
the state of Arizona is not. The healthful, dry air of this state,
famed the world over, brings hundreds of tuberculosis patients to
the state every year. Therefore the war on tuberculosis is a special
concern of Arizona. And citizens of the Warren District are also
loyal citizens of Arizona, with its best interests at heart. Besides
the larger and more altruistic motive of helping humanity througu
the purchase of Red Cross Christmas Seals, they have the additional
motive of pride in slate, bringing a desire to help .the state in its
fight in behalf df the tuberculosis invalids who flock to it, attracted
by its splendid climate.
The Red Cross Christmas Seal sale opened December 1. It is
up to Bisbee citizens to establish a record for sale's of the seals in
' this city.
Buy some Red Cross Christmas Seats today. And when these are
gone, buy some more. Red Cross Seals will make it possible to
employ nurses to care for Arizona's sick. Join in the fight against
tuberculosis, and help make Arizona, in spite of its influx of the
sick, the healthiest state in the American Union.
FAIR PRICES AGAIN
ARIZONA is to be organized today for a war on profiteers, and
the maintenance of fair prices for all the commodities of life
within every city in the state. State, county and federal offi
cials are to meet in the state capital today with the state fair
price commissioner to organize fair price boards in every community,
and provide machinery for the enforcement of the rulings of such
boards as to what are fair prices. The Arizona Merchants' Associa
tion, with which nearly 1Q0 per cent of the merchants in Bisbee are
affiliated, is backing up the authorities and the fair price boards
with its whole-hearted support. Arizona has had but a minimum or
profiteering, and the organization of fair price boards should, give
the pople of the state confidence in the prices asked and put a final
quietus on all gougings of the private purse in future. -
GIFTS YOU'D LIKE TO GIVE
HERETOFORE at Christmas time you've been giving Christmas
gifts that folks like to receive. Why not change things about
this year and now, when you are planning to do your shopping
early, arrange to give presents that you'd like to giv, instead
of woirying about getting the sort of things that folks will like to
receive. It would simplify matters so greatly and, furthermore, it
might have a very pleasing effect on yourself and surroundings for
the next year. Let's explain just what we mean:
Instead of giving Susie Soprano, who goes to pieces on the high
C every night, some new music, which she would like to receive,
give her just what you'd like to give her a Maxim silencer!
Instead of giving Cousin Hariy a comb for his beard, which lie
would like to receive, give him what you'd like to present him with
a safety razor and complete instructions for looking like a human
being.
Instead of giving Neiehbor John J. Borrower a box of cigars,
give him what you'd like to give him the bill for the repairs which
were made on your lawn mower after he had borrowed it every week
during the summer time. N
And so on down the entire list you have made folks to whom
you must give something.
Talk about giving practical and useful Christmas presents!
These sure would be those!

We know it must 'be true,
That Radicals in prison
Will not consume their stew

That these same red fanatics
Have resolved to speak no word.
We might believe the rumor
That a Radical won't eat,
For there may be some good excuse
In prison bread and meat.

We simply stand and balk,

of the death, pust in what should

one who we thought was enjoying per

deaths were caused by what physi

namely Bright's diseases, heart fail

SIZING UP A TRAGEDY
"Look here," stormed the customer,
pointing to the tureen. "What is the
meaning of that fly in the soup?"
"I regret, sir," said the waiter, po
litely. "I cannot supply you with the
desired information. I am only sup
posed to serve the soup, not explain
ingredients." ,
"But a fly, man,' persisted the cus
tomer, "a fly! How did it happen?"
"I am sorry to say, sir,' 'replied the
waiter, "I have no idea how the poor
creatuer met its fate. Possibly it had
not taken any food for a long time and
fluttering near the soup, found the fla
vor particular pleasing and eating too
heartily, contracted appendicitis or
somekindred ailment, which, in the eb
senec of an opportunty for the appli
cation of the X-rays and the resultant
operation, caused its untimely end."
PEPY'S DIARY IN BISBEE
Dec. 4. To town early this day to meet some pioneers, after my wife
had given ,a lot of directions about my health, which would have been all
right if she had not insisted upon rubbing turpentine on my chest, so that
my old friends were appraised of my coming long before 1 reached the
house. Many tales this day about the early times in Bisbee, when there
were no more baths than there are today and when a man could buy a
pound of sausage without mortgaging the old homestead. To Judge Allison,
who also had some information about the early days, also some about his
oil company, in which I think that he is more interested. To the cigar store,
where I watched the young lady mix me a hot chocolate, and whom I com
plimented in my best, but she gave me a surly look, so that I will have to
mention now that I saw a hole in her stocking when she walked to the cash
rtgister. The assistant cashier did tell today of her new boudoir set, with
a pink cap, and pink pajamas and pink slippers, which it seems are to be
worn at the breakfast table. But if her house has as many cracks in it as
mine she will come down to breakfast , in an overcoat and will save the
boudoir set for about July 4. Much favorable comment this day about the
paving in Tombstone canyon, tempered, however, by the thought that when
we have saved some shoe leather by walking on it the price, of footwear
will go sky-larking again. To Chief Kempton, who is mighty elated that he
has twelve burros in his pound, and that none have escaped since they were
locked up. I hear also that be is trying to sell them, so that rumor about
the soap factory must have been false, although it was the basis of many
an interesting hypothesis. To the office after a hard day's grind, where 1
found a lot of bills and no money, which is the main reason, I think, why
I am always humble. To the house early, finding my wife making out her
list of Christmas presents, which so disheartened me that I went to beci
without even asking for the hot water bottle, so that I spent a chill night,
heartened, however, by the thought that she is going to get only half of
what she thinks she is, while some one in California may send me a bottle
of cocktails.

NfcW WAY IU AIVltmv,MINI4t.
A new Americanization agency lias
been found in the kindergarten. The
! discovery in this institution's value
j in the work of Americanizing the
j otherwise foreign portion of American
cities, has been made by a number of
business men.
Letters telling the success of kin
dergartens, maintained by manufac
turers for the children of their em
ployes, have been received by the
United States bureau of education.
Teaches Honesty
The great benefit of using this
means to reach the foreign element is
that it taeks the children at the most
impressionable time of life and trains
them in honesty, efficiency and moral
ity. Here little foreigners may .learn
American's songs and history and at
the same time absorb its democratic
spirits.
Another benefit pointed out is that
the kindergarten engages the inter
est of the foreign mothers. Teachers
have time to visit their pupils' homes
and meet the mothers on a ground of
common interest. This leads to the
mothers being persuaded to come to
the monthly mothers' meeting at the
kindergarten, wheer they meet other
mothers intrested in the same prob
lem of bringing up their children in
the right way.
Consider It Nucleus
One manufacturer has written:
"We consider the kindergarten a
nucleus from which to develop all
phases of welfare work. We believe
that kindergarten work is of untold
value in the development of industry,
loyalty, patriotism, civic and social re
sponsibility." Another typical statement is:
"I would sooner clos our schools
than the kindergarten. We consider
it the best form of training our young
people have . . . teacbes loyalty,
discipline .application and industry,"
A COMMON PARADOX
"So you're still carrying a mort
gage on your house, are you?"

PAVED JIH
If storms, due Bisbee this winter,
can schedule their visit to this city
later than January 6, the main street
here will be paved by that date.
Good weather and no breaks in the
work, or in the one ce-ment mixer,
will see the street workers finished
here within a mouth, claims City En
gineer Halleck.
Continued fair weather will permit
the first cement pouring on Alain
street this afternoon or tomorrow
morning. Grading up to the subway
has been completed.
The Tombstone Canyon road should
be opened by Tuesday from Gibson
Hines Lumber company to the city
limits, Halleck estimates. It is open
now except for a stretch near the
Lincoln school.
The cement pouring, on Main street
should not take more than six days,
according to the engineer's figures.
Curing of the cement takes three
weeks before the surface will hold up
under any heavy traffic. In a drier
climate the cement will harden much
more rapidly.
Preparations for pavement of Naco
road, in front of the City Hall, have
been started with the readjustment of
the gas and water pipes by those
companies for the proper level with
the new street pavement.

L. E. Montgomery was well known
here. More than a year ago he left
the Copper Queen company to enter
work in government offices. About
three months ago he was injured in
an accident, the results of which con
fined him to bed. He has not been
able to get up since the fatal injury
and physicians declared his death
was caused by the injury, which had
affected certain ligaments in his
neck.
'Mr. Montgomery is survived by his
wife, Grace; his father, both of New

Bisbee.

Musterole Works Without the

There's no sense in mixing a mess
of mustard, flour and water when you
can easily relieve pain, soreness or stiff
ness with a little clean, wfiite Musterole.
Musterole is made of pure oil of
mustard and other helpful ingredients,
combined in the form of the present
white ointment. It takes the place of
mustard plasters, and will not blister.
Musterole usually gives prompt relief
from sore throat, bronchitis, tonsilitis,
croup, stiff neck,' asthma, neuralgia,
headache, congestion, pleurisy.rheuma

UPSETS RULE
THIS YEAR IN
SPORT REALM
BY FRED TURBYVILLE
When Kid Gleason said "the best
team lost" he probably meant "what
looked like the best team lost.
It has been thus throughout 'the
, sport season of 1919 and continues
on up through the eleventh hour.
The win of Jack Dempsey over Wil
lard;. the triumph of White Sox over
Cleveland, New York and Detroit;
the triumph of Reds over. Giants; the
triumph of Reds over White Sox, and
the triumph of minor college football
teams over the big fellows all might
be classed as upsects since a major
ity of observers in the sport world
had expected just the opposite in re
sults. And now that the football season is
oer the upsets have been taken over
as a part, of the boxing game, that
probably accounting for the unusual
interest being taken in all ring shows.
First comes Johnny Noye , of ,St.
Paul and scores an unexpected win
over the sensational Lew Tendler of
Philadelphia. The trpset took place iin
Denver, where the critics credited
Noye with giving the easterner a hard
drubbing.
S3 when Noye started east the fans
sat up and looked interested. Noye
stopped off in Cleveland to loosen up
against Cal Delaney who was not con
sidered a real topnotcher. And Noye
took a beating. He said he had an off
night and continued on to Philadel
phia to meet Tendler in his home
town. Tendler knocked him out in
two rounds.
Consider the case of Frank Moran
and Homer Smith. Homer is a native
of Mihlgan and had been winning in
every start- It was believed he was
headed straight for a match with
Dempsey. Moran, a veteran, took his
measure in the third round.
And then the sensational Martin
Burke of New Orleans he had to quit
to George Chip in the tenth round
round at New Orleans. He claimed a
broken rib caused him such pain he
.could not continue.
- The old fellows like Moran and Chip
are dangerous if they are fn any kind
Of shape and it seems that both veter
ans are as fit as the proverbial fiddle.
Moran appeared to be In the pink
when he polished Smith off at De
troit The old time cunning was there
and he hit hard with straight and
hook. . Chip, though not a real heavy
weight, is little lighter than Burke,
and he probably knew too much for
the younster.
The fast traveling Noye, Smith and
Burke must now start all over if they
hope to prosper in the fight game. A
knockout defeat is a hard thing to
live down, but you've got to give these

From the moment the . referee, B J. their willingness to meet really tough
opponents.
Angle, called time, Carpentier
the battle entirely in his own hands
Beckett never had a chance of hit
ting the agile Frenchman, who land
ed blovs with enormous strength
whenever he felt inclined.
Amid absolute stillness most of the
spectators could hear the terrific
crack of the swing that put Beckett
to sleep. There was a roar of cheer
ing as Carpentier assisted- Beckett
to his corner, where the Englishman
opened his astonished eyes and saw
his opponent being carried on the
shoulders of the enthusiasts around
the ring and the Frenchman was
smiling happily.
The contestants presented a not
able difference in appearance when
they stripped and were introduced
Beckett swarthy and muscular; Car
pentier white skinned, with slight
figure. Carpentier looked about him
as though accustomed to his sur
roundings; Beckett seemed some
what nervous.
Peer and peeresses, members of
the house of commons, high officials
of state, many women, most of them
in evening gowns, and the prince of
wales looked the fighters over criti
cally as they squared up.
As a fight the contest was not spec
tacular. Carpentier was fast on his
feet, dancing in and out and playing
havoc with the Englishman from the
first lead. With lightning swiftness
Carpeniier's left leaped out and
caught Ceckett on the face, and a
suppressed sigh was audible all over
the house. A quick breakaway fol
lowed a short clinch and the French
man landed two more hard lefts.
Beckett, wilh a sort of bulldog de
termination, forced Carpentier almost
to the ropes. But this was a diver
sion for a moment only, for the
Frenchman stepped back and then
forward,, and, with all his strength
and the full weight of his body,
swung his right to the Englishman's
jaw and Beckett went down and out.
The beting was heavy before the
contest, odds of seven to four being
laid on Beckett, and most of those
present were losers, although Car
pentier had plenty of supporters.
BOBBY WAUGH IN DISFAVOR
As far as Bobby Waugh, the Texas
fighter is concerned. Globe and Mi
ami have ceased to exist, profession-1
ally speaking, says the Globe Record.
Determined that the sporting public
shall be protected in the future
against such fiascos as the Robinson-
Waugh bout proved to be Saturday
night, the management of the Pas
time Athletic club, which sponsored
the last fight, announced yesterday
that. Waugh never would appear again
in this district under the auspices of
this organization.
For Willie Robinson, the manage
ment, as in the case with the major
ity of the fans, entertains only the
kindest sentiment.
to Waugh's disbarment, the manage
ment of the athletic club shed an illu
minative light upon the poor showing
made by the Texan. Waugh, accord
ing to the matchmaker, utilized the
preparatory period largely to sympa
thize with Robinson and to admitting
to admiring friends that Leonard's
days were numbered.
Then, it is said, Bobby had peculiar
training ideas. He is said to have
substituted cigarettes for sparring
and booze for road work.

(Kid) George has been selected to
act as the third man in the ring
when Johnny Meyer and Happy
Woods face each other in their 10-
round bout in the opera house in this
city on the night of December 11.
George, who had a large following
here duting his career as a middle

Loughery-Celmars bout and the Nick
Gundy-Ralp Lincoln bout in Bisbee
with excellent satisfaction to all who
saw those matches.

preparation for his match with
Happy Woods, the hard-hitting1 Tus

Monday to give the local fans a

Frank Loughery yesterday after
noon sent a telegram to Phoeni
challenging the winner of the Rus
sell Chambers-Eddie Huse bout, to
be read at the ringside in the capital
city tonight.
Local fans are wondering where
Russell Chambers acquired the title
of "welterweight champion of the
border states." The bout tonight in
Phoenix is advertised as a titular go,
Huse being Pacific coast welter
weight champion, while Chambers is
credited with the border states title.
Bisbee fans are unable to reconcile
Chambers' claims with the fact that
Frank Loughery gained a decision
over him on the occasion of the last
meeting of the pair, in the ring at

8V REVIEW LEASED WIRE
STOCKS AND BONOS
NEW YORK, Dec. 4. In its salient
characteristics today stronger and
broader stock market was largely a
duplicate of the preceding session.
The substantially higher range of
many Issues resulted mainly from
further Involuntary covering of short
contracts.
Disregarding the increasingly acute
conditions in the coal strike and the
Mexican situation, traders seemed to
derive much encouragement from the
easier trend of money, the better tone
of the bond arket and temporary re
laxation of the tension in foreign ex
change. Favorable trade conditions facili
tated the operations of pools in vari
ous stocks, especially motors and
their acfcessories; oils, steels, equip
ments and food and tobacco shares.
In these groups extreme gains of 3 to
13 points were featured by General
Motors, Texas Company, Mexican Pe
troleum, Middle States Oil, Crucible
Steel, United Retail Stores, Tobacco
Products, Sugar and Corn Products.
Coppers were moderately responsive
to a better demand for the metal and
textiles, Industrial Alcohol and sev
eral of the chemical isues improved
for like reasons, but rails remained
sluggish or heavy. Sales amounted
to 1,150,000 shares.
The general bond list moved for
ward with Liberty and Victory issues,
but eased slightly at the end. To
tal sales, par value, aggregated $24,
250,000. Old United States bonds
were unchanged on call.

PITTSBURGH, Kan., Doc. 4 Kan
sas got a toe hold in the coal mining
business today.
Toward storm-swept southwest Kan
sas, where the mercury is hovering a
few degrees above zero, is speeding
tonight the first car of coal mined by
volunteer workers in the strip pits of
the Pittsburgh field. It was billed
out of Pittsburgh this afternoon to
the mayor of Coluwater, Kans., and
was expected to be followed tonight
by other cars destined for sections
where the coal famine is most acute.
The dirt walls of the pit were
frozen solid and at the bottom were
treacherous reaches of ice and ice
covered pools of water. It was a day
that ordinarily would have brought a
halt to mining operations.
The first contingent of volunteer
miners, which arrived yesterday, was
augmented today by the arrival of
600 additional men. Officials an
nounced t.hey would be put to work
tomorrow. O. S. Hubert, general
manager of operations, said he ex
pected to have a majority of the
steam shovels in the district work
ing full time tomorrow or Thursday.
Distribution of the coal mined in
the strip pits by the volunteers will
be made through the mayors of the
various Kansas towns and cities
where the coal is sent. Gov. Henry
J. Allen announced today.
Kansas guardsmen continued ' to
guard the strip pits today while the
federal troops remained encamped
on the grounds of the state normal
school here.
Among the volunteers who reached
Pittsburgh today are business men,
clerks and college students.

Jt is true that the Dort is more than ordinarily
economical in the use of gasoline and oil.
Its tire mileage, likewise, is visibly higher than
is usual.
The sum of your savings in these three points
will run up to an appreciable amount in the
course of a season.
But you will find the most noteworthy econo
my of the Dort in such items as overhauling,
tuning up and replacements.
It requires the minimum of service attention to keep
it In fit condition nd continuous service.
Twj factors are chiefly responsible for this. They
typify the Dort ideal in manufacture.
One is the skill and painstaking precision which
characterizes every step in the process of production.
The other is the extreme simplicity and accessibility
of Dort construction.
The first provides you with a car that is certain to
travel smopthly, ably, quickly and reliably for a long
time.
The second makes it possible for you yourself
without expert and expensive assistance to adjust,
tune-up- or "dope" up any part when that should be
come desirable.
Your appreciation of the Dort will grow with every
mile, you drive it and every month you own it. Terms
to suit,

Th nation and especially the, south,
was at about this time shocked by
the fact that the president had casu
ally invited.. Booker.. T. Washington,
Negro educator, to lunch with him. No
putlic moment was ever made of
Rooevelt on this act, which his closest
friends always looked upon as an er
rir of judgment. But in this letter to
a man who knew the old southern ne
gro as did nonoe other , the president
: expresses the somewhat wistful hope
that sectionalism might lose Its bit
terness through an appreciation of the
child-like qualities of the real negro.

MY DEAR HARRIS:
It is worth while toeing president

that kind of an autograph gift. When
I was younger than she is, my Aunt
Annie Gulloch of Georgia, used to tell
me some of the brer raDbit stories,
especially brer rabbit and the tar
baby. But fond though I am of the
brer rabbit stories I think I am eveu
fonder of your other writings. I doubt
if there is a more genuinely pathetic
tale in all our literature than "Free
Joe." Moreover J have felt that all
that you write serves to bring our
people closer together.' I kriow, of
course, the .ordinary talk is that an

A Ride and a Pillow Fight
White House, October 19, 1903.
DEAR KERMIT:
- I was much pleased at your being
made captain of your eleven. I would
rather have you captain of the third
eleven than playing on the second.
Yesterday afternoon Ethel on Wyo
ming, mother on Yakenka and I on
Renown, had a long ride, the only in
cident being meeting a large red aut
omobile which much shook Renown's
nerves, althouh he behaved far better
than he has hitherto been doing about
automobiles. In face, he behaved so
well that I leaned over and gave him
pathized so much with your delight
in physical prowress and have been so
glad at the success you have had, thai?
sometimes I have been afraid I have
failed to emphasize sufficiently the
fact that of course one must not sub
ordinate study and work to the culti
vation of such prowress. By the way
I am sorry to say that I am falling
behind physically. The last two or
three years I have had a tendency to
rheumatism or gout, or something of
the kind, which makes me very stiff, children to spend the afternoon at Dr
trainer's 1 do not know. Rather to
my surprise, Ronald has won golden
opinions and really is a very nice dog.
Pickney loves him, and he sits up in
the express wagon just as if it was
what he had been born to.
Quentin is learning to ride the pony.
He had one tumble, which he remark
ed philosophically, did not hurt him
any more than when I whacked him
with a sofa cushion in one of our pil
low fights. I think he will very soon
be able to manage his pony by him
self. Mother has just taken the three
Renown is behaving better about
automobiles and the like. I think the
difference is largerly in the way
I handle him. He is a very good-natured
and gentle horse, but timid anl
not over-wise, and when in a panic
his great strength makes 'him well
nigh uncontrollable. Accordingly, he
is a bad horse to try to force by any
thing. If possible, it is much better
to give him a little time and bring
him up as gently as may be to the ol

I am really greatly pleased at your
standing so high ir. your form, and I
am sure that this year it is better for
you to be playing where you are in
football. I suppose net j year you will
go back to your position of end, as
you would be hardly enough for play

against teams with big fellows. I re-

Yesterday I felt rather seedy, hav

unpleasant reminiscence of the San

the afternoon in the house lying on
the sofa, with a bright fire burning
and mother in the rocking chair, with
her knitting beside me. I felt so glad
that I was not out somewhere in the
