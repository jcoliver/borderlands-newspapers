Money Is Pledged By Mining Companies to Committee of
American Legion; Large Sum Also Raised By the Central
Labor Union; Bacon and Vegetables to Be Sold to the
First Comers; No Profit to Any Except Ult. Consumers
Having received backing to the ex
tent of 120,000 through the efforts of
the food committees of the American
Legion and the Central Labor union.
Mayor Jacob Erickson last evening
sent in an order for two carloads of
army surplus supplies, to be. disposed
of to the people of Bisbee at prices
based on cost plus freight. One car
load "will consist of bacon and the
other of canned vegetables.
Mayor Jacobson already had se
cured advance orders for about $6,-
000 to apply on a carload of bacon.
which will cost a little more than
$11,000. Orders for several hundred
dollars more were taken yesterday
by R. J. Wilbert. chairman of the
Central Labor union's food commit
tee, who kept his office open all day
in the Philadelphia hotel building on
O. K. street.
The American Legion's food com
mittee, which was appointed Thurs
day night,' lost no time in getting
busy, with the result that several of
the mining companies of the district
offered backing of $20,000 for tho
project. Those on the American Le
gion's committee were Ira Joralemon
Tom Egan, John Rock, W. S. Beeman
and James Corretto.
Mayor Erickson said that the sup
plies were not on hand at the army
post In El Paso at present, but tha
it was expected they would be re
ceived by the middle of the week.
The "mayor said the goods would
either be sold from the car, or would
be placed in the city hall building
and disposed of there. The first
comers, those .who put their money
on the counter first, will have their
pick of the supplies. There will be
no profit In the deal for anyone but
the consumers.
The members of L. A. Engel post,
American Legion, were anxious to
have the experiment of civilians using
army food tried. They said they had
gotten fat on these supplies and while
they might not be of as fancy brand
as some now being sold at a much
higher price, they considered them
good and wholesome and predicted
they would effect a material saving
for the consumer.
Besides the car of bacon, the car
load of tanned vegetables ordered by
Mayor Erickson consists of the fol
lowing: Straing beans ..'.8,400 pounds
Sweet corn 8,400 pounds
Green peas 8,400 pounds
Tomatoes j. .'. 11.880 pounds

FIIOENIX. Apg. 9. W. B. Cleary,
formerly of Bisbee, and who accom
panied the train carrying the Wob
blies out of that camp on July 12,
1917, has written to local parties here
to the effect that he is coming to
Phoenix to take up the practice of law.
He has also suggested that those ad
vocating "one big union" in labor cir
cles enter the Arizona political con
test next year with a candidate for
governor.
Cleary has been making his home
In California for the past two years
and has devoted much of his time to
the interests of I. W. W. defendants
in criminal courts. He recently made
a speech to the strikers in the Los
Angeles shipyards when he advised
thom to tear-up their various union
cards and take membership in the
"one big union," according to a Los
Angeles paper.
Clary may be planning to become
the "one big union" candidate for gov
ernor next year. This would give him
an opportunity to Tesume his "soap
box" oratory in the state.

hausted. Mr. wilbert will again be
at his desk today in the Philadelphia
hotel building from 9 until 3 o'clock

Mr. Wilbert requests that as many
persons as possible who want to pur
chase food file, their orders so that
there will be less confusion in dis
tribution when the two carloads of
supplies arrive.

ceived no advices as to when or how
consumers may order food and have
It delivered by parcel post. This plan
was announced last week In Wash
ington, but so far no instructions

JENA, Germany, Aug. 9. Prof Ernst Heinrich Haeckel, professor
of zoology at the University of Jena, and famous throughout the world
for his research work supporting the theory of evolution, died here
today.
Haeckel's principal claim to fame in the popular mind lay in his
advocacy of the modern monistic philosophy, his most popular works

tory of Creation," being widely read in the United States and Great
Britain, as well as throughout continental Europe.

Spokesman for Peace Envoys
Says Troops Will Not Leave
Budapest Until Hungarians
Have Been Entirely Disarmed
PARIS, Aug. 9. (By the Associated
Press) "We are at a loss to under
stand why the allies and the Ameri
cans above all should criticize Ru
mania for its action in defending the
Bolshevik! in Hungary," said Nicholas
Misu, of the Rumanian peace delega
tion today.
"We feel that we have done the
peace conference and the entire world
a service by giving the Hungarians
an opportunity to set up a responsi
ble government; further, we were
forced to march against Budapest.
"Then, when other armies refused
to move against the Hungarian
Bolshevik!, we moved alona We
shall move our troops from Budapest
when the Hungarians have been thor
oughly disarmed and no longer
threaten our very existence.
"Meantime, we hope the whole
world will take pains to learn the
truth about the peril which forces us
to fight for our lives. We have never
left the peace conference and shall
obey its orders, but we cannot sign
the Austrian treaty if it contains no
provisions for the . protection of mi
norities. We believe it wrong for
the big powers to force such condi
tions on the small powers.
"We favored a clause proposed for
the League of Nations, which would
have guaranteed the rights of all per
sons, regardless of race or religion
and believe that such action should
be taken by all the nations, acting
together and imposed upon all alike,
rather than upon a few small powers
by the great powers." .
M. Misu said that the central pow
ers took 2000 locomotives from the
Rumanians, leaving them only 200, of
which 80 -were really in good repair.
Rumania probably will get back about
1000 locomotives in the armistice
terms it is enforcing againBt Hun
gary. M. Misu declared. These are
necessary for reconstruction.

EE PROBE
TUESDAY NEXT
J. C. Ryan, county highway engi
neer, has been invited to attend the
session of the county board of super
visors which on Tuesday will begin
an investigation into the washing out
during last Sunday's flood of the new
$30,000 concrete bridge across the
San Pedro river near Benson. Mr.
Ryan, under whose administration as
county engineer the bridge was built,
believes the bridge could have been
saved had proper precautions been
taken.
Mr. Ryan came back from Benson
in rapid time and reported the roads
in first class shape. He said work
of grading was now under way to
build a temporary bridge across the
San Pedro to take the place of the
structure washed out.
No ford has been found so far and
farmers the other side of the San
Pedro are forced to make a detour of
about eight miles and use the bridge
at St. David in order to get across
the San Pedro.
Enjoyable Program
For 'Y' Secretaries
One hundred lads of the Junior Y.
M. C. A. gave a welcome-home lunch
con in the "Y" gymnasium yesterday
noon in honor of Earl V. Thompson,
boys' secretary, who is just back
from the school for boys' secretaries
conducted at Estes Park, Colo., in
July. Songs, wrestling mafches, an
oriental dance and quantities of good
things to eat, served by the Mothers'
club, made the occasion highly enjoy,
able.
Gerdard Downs scintillated as the
toastmaster, and interesting talks
were made by Mr. Thompson and by
John Salmons. Mr. Thompson gave
an interesting account of his work
at Estes Park and of the plans laid
for work among the younger boys.
In the principal wrestling bout of
the day, Albert Odinetto threw Albert
Goldbaum. Little Louis Gregovich,
dressed as a Turkish girl, gave an
oriental dance and had the spectators
completely fooled until he unmasked.
Entries Monday In
'Y' Tennis Tourney
Miss Martha Greeley, girls' secre
tary at the Y. W. C. A., will begin
tomorrow accepting entries for the
forthcoming tennis tournament for
men and women. The entrance fee
is 25 cents. Women will file their
entries at the Y. W. and the men at
the Y. M. C. A., with L. H. Hall.
Women's singles, men's singles, wom
en's doubles and men's doubles, and
mixed doubles, will be played off.
A handicap system for the women
tennis players will be worked out, as
well as for the men, so that the be
ginner will have a chance against the
more expert player. The new tennis
net purchased for the Y. W. C. A.
from the entry fees of the last tour
nament will arrive in time for the
forthcoming matches.
With the end of the rainy season,
it is believed there will be much
greater interest in this tennis tour
ney than there was in the last, when
storms often interfered with the
games.
Well, vne can get an idea from Eng

Carload of Buicks
On Way to District
Ed Plumb, the Lowell agent for the
Buick and Cadillac cars, received
word yesterday that a carload or
Buicks, containing five machines,
bnoum De on hand by the fifteenth
of the month. No Cadillacs are in
sight for the present. Both these
popular cars are snapped up almost
as fast as they are received, three ol
the forthcoming carload of Buicks
navmg already been spoken for.
Of the shipment, three are five pas
senger and two seven-passenger ma
chines. The smaller car is selling
ror $1,725 this year, and the Buick
"Big Six" for $2,050. During the
week Mr. Plumb delivered two
Buicks, one a five-passenger machine,
to A. W. Hudson, mining engineer,
and the other, a seven-passenger car,
to Hugh McLeod of Bisbee.
Mr. Plumb expects to be in his
new garage by Sept. 1. His place
will have a frontage of 75 feet and
will have the largest showroom in
the Warren district.
W. L. Smart of the Chevrolet
agency will also have a large show
room in the same building and will
open up a service station about Sept.
1 with a complete stock of new parts
and other materials to the value ot
about ?4,000.-
MINTS TO
FROM BALTIMORE
W. ,G. Canion, president of the
Canion Air Brake company, arrived
in Bisbee early this morning from
Baltimore to attend a meeting of .the
stockholders committee here this aft
ernoon.. Mr. Canion, who lived In
Bisbee for some years, is known as
an inventive genius and those who
have examined his new air brake say
it is a highly effective device.
As long as the Austrian cabinet has
determined to resign, why not resign

BUILDING
IV
E
Apartment houses of a modern
type are to be the next development
for Bisbee and Warren, judging from
the inquiries received at the Warren
District Commercial club. Secretary
Thomas Egan said yesterday that
considerably more than half of the
inquiries from prospective residents
asked as to the apartment house fa
cilities here.
Already some of the local business
men in both Bisbee and Warren are
talking of constructing some modern
apartments. It is believed there would
be little difficulty in financing the
project and that all the apartments
would be spokeri for long before their
completion.
Many households "prefer apart
ments to bungalows or cottages, ow
ing to the fact that they have no fur
naces or stoves to attend to and in
a modern building have almost all the
conveniences of a hotel. It is be
lieved the next important building
movement in the district will be along
the line of high-class apartments.

TEAMS - LINE UP
IN BISBEE AND
DOUGLAS TODAY
Several carloads of Bisbee baseball
enthusiasts will accompany tho regu
lar Bisbee team to Douglas today,
where it will clash with the nine from
the Nineteenth infantry. Scott, the
crack first baseman of the local ag
gregation, who has been in Ray, ' is
expected in time today to get in the
game. Arthur Walsh, who sprained
his ankle some time ago, also may
get in the line-up. '
Roy Brashear, manager of the Bis
beeites, has two more good players
in sight from Los Angeles who will
be in next week. They would have
been in the line-up today but for a
mix-up in telegrams. However, the
local men believe they will call a halt
today on their recent losing streak.
Toner and Price will be the battery
for the Bisbeeites. Next Sunday the
local team will play the Nineteenth
infantry aggregation at Warren.
While Bisbee is away, the "Lowell
team, greatly strengthened by the
addition of four crack players from
El Paso, will line up against the First
cavalry nine at the Warren grounds.
Rain checks given at last Sunday's
game will be honored today.
The Bisbee Cubs, under the man
agement of Al Kobey and composed
entirely of amateurs, also has a game
away from home today, going against
the Willcox team.
Oswald Burns 'Em

Joe Oswald, for two years pitcher
with the Lowell team, is going strong
in the Sioux City team of the West
ern league and is justifying all pre
dictions made for him by his local
ad irers, according to a card received
from him yesterday by C. C. Earth
man. Oswald says he went up into
Dakota last week and pitched two
winning games against the Chamber
lain, S. D., team.
In the first game Oswald shut out
the Dakotans, 8. to 0, pitching a no
hit game and striking out 21 men. He
won his second game, 3 to 0, allow

History:
has Earth yielded the riches that Texts and the Southwestern Oil
Fields have put into the hands of man. The great Bonanzas of the
past California of 49, Pikes Peak, Butte, Cripple Creek, all dwarf
into insignificance by comparison. Measured in .Dollars, no mineral
wealth drawn from the Earth in a given time, can approach it. It en
thralls the imaginaion. With, such a resource added to the mineral
assets of Arizona, an era approaching the fabled millenium would
open before us.
Is such a thing possible? Perhaps it is.
The men behind the United States Oil and Refining Company of Ari
zona are putting their Dollars into an effort to find out why the oil
area3 of Texas cannot be expanded a few degrees of longitude to the
westward and take us in, too. They believe it can be done and they
ask YOU and other red blooded citizens to help out, HOW? By
Subscribing for the Company's
"promotion" stock at 10c per share.
i
This Promotion Stock is a special privilegeand a rare opportunity to
get stock with this Company at ONE FIFTH the current price of the
Treasury Stock (50c) as fixed by the Arizona Corporation Com
mission. This low price, 10c, is only possible because the promoters
surrendered four-fifths of their promotion stock to the Bank of Bis
bee as Trustee, conditioned that it be marketed at 1 0c a share solely
for development purposes. And in this way you may become a
shareholder with this company at a time when developments are well
advanced and prospects highly attractive, BECAUSE!, Drilling is just
about to be resumed. A few shifts will carry the well, already down
300 feet, into oil sands that tested high in physical and chemical prop
erties, as revealed in a test well near the present well site. The Com
pany now has casing and full equipment to continue drilling without
interruption to any depth necessary to prove the field. It has large
land holdings aggregating 1 0,000 acres, both in the Bowie Basin and
the highly promising Deming Quadrangle, New Mexico, in the same
geological structure.
You may buy this Stock at 1 0c a share from J. L. Powell, Secretary of
the United States Oil & Refining Company, and L. J. Overlock.
Broker, and we believe it to be almost an obligation of the loyal citi
zens of this District to support an enterprise of such high local im

A Sketch of the Little City Across the Rio Grande
Which Seems To Be the Favorite Shooting Up
Place of the Mexican Revolutionist.
Copyright, 1010. The International Syndicate.
VER Ince Francesco Villa, the
bandit, came down from the
mountains and expressed his de
termination ot avenging the
death of Madero, who was for a time
president of Mexico, the City of
Juarez Just across the Rio Grande
from El Paso. Texas, has been the
bull's eye for his shot. .
Villa's Sport
Villa is a sort of lovable villain with
the Mexicans and although, according
to the U. S. press he has several times
been captured and killed and has lost
as many arms and legs as a centipede
possesses, yet only recently he came
Into Juarez with his men and as usual
assisted in shooting up thetown. Nearly
every house In the city bears marks of
his work from time to time. Several
work from time to time. Several
times he captured the city and each
time many buildings were ruined and
a number of people killed. Recently
he paid another visit. Several shots
were fired across the river and our
men were put on guard on the Ameri

as they called It. General Pershing's
men had a skirmish and several of our
men were last. It was then thought
better to withdraw and for a while
Villa was quiet. But after a time he
began again and his first bit of activity
was to shoot up Juarez. Whether he
thought this a particular easy mark or
whether he felt that his coming so
close to the United States was' an In
sult to that nation or whether the last
raid was the result of German propa
ganda In Mexico If not known: per
haps it Is a mixture of all three. How
ever, Villa is a menace to the pence
of Mexico and a trouble maker for the
United States as well. That he Is fear
less, no' one doubts, end his savage
treatment of prisoners often equals
that of the Huns. A man without the
slightest education, yet with a per
sonality which draws the Mexicans to
his standard he Is continually fighting.
At one time he was friendly with Car

war with Mexico, in fact, it has never
wanted a war and has been forced
Into It when the behavior of other
nations has reached a point where our
country could only mnintin its honor
by taking up arms and many people
believe that Mexico will never be
finally settled until the United State's
soldiers cross the Rio Grande and
make the natives understand that
America can stand no more.
From time to time the Juarez dif

more settles down to business, but with

across the "silvery" Rio Grande, a

Sketch of the Town
The city itself is a town of the State
of Chihuahua and is fertile for stock
raising an. frui cultivation when It
has time between Villa's raids. Its
population In normal times Is about
7.000 persons, but very much smaller
auring tne snooting up season when
cmi-
H Is named after Benito Pablo Juarez,
one of the Mexican presidents, a man
born In 1808 and of Indian parentage.
He .was educated by a wealthy Mexi
can and studied law. Mexico was in
its usual state of revolution and
he became enmeshed in it and
finally its president for a time. He
lived la Juarez several years and the
house In which he lived is still pointed
cut as a show place. There is also a
very fine monument erected In his
memory which is really worth a trip
from El Paso to see. History tells us
that Juarez was a man of unusual at
tainments for one of his birth. He
was absolutely fearless of danger and
was usually sincere in his reforms.
The town is truly Mexican and once
across the bridge one might as well be
in the heart of Mexico from the ap
pearance of the people and the old
adobe houses. Of course, there is a
plaza' and a market place for they
exist ' in every Mexican town. The
market place Is a poor excuse of a
sales place for ill-smelling "jerked

The plazas are where, the Mexicans
who are "ne'er to wells" sit around
and are perfect examples of Dickens'
"Micawber," who was always "waiting
for something to turn up." There is
a jail which is always well-filled. The
postofflce was runled -by Villa's men
and at present the business is done
in a sort of shack,. A peculiar situation
arose in posting letters during one of
Villa's occupations which made mall
coming from there rather interesting.
pretty soon comes to the conclusion
that any nation whose national sport
is the Inhuman torture of animals can
not amount to much as a nation.
There U perhaps some skill In killing
the bull (who never has & chance) by
striking him, at a certain vital spot,
Uit there certainly Is bo- true sport In
driving blindfolded old horses direct
ly in front of a maddened ball and
allowing them to be disemboweled
while the populace applauds. As the
boys ar as delighted with this process
as our own boys are charmed with
baseball one feels that the kindness ot
the future generation of Mexico Li
hopeless.
. Chicken Fighting
Chicken fighting is another brutal
sport in Juarez and men will go about
carrying roosters to which spurs hava
been tied seeking matches and when
one Is found there Is blood and bets,
for while the chickens often fight to
death the men bet every cent they
have, although their families may be
starving. Unfortunately betting on
chicken fights is not confined to Mexi
cans, as the writer has seen many
Americans In the game.
Fine Race Track
The great race track at Juarez Is
known throughout the world and with
Its massive grandstand and wonderful
track it Is really a splendid setting for

Some of the most famous horses In
the world have made records there
and the sporting fraternity and tho
men who really own good horses have
rubbed shoulders there. Of course,
the race track people stay In El Paso,
for there Is no fit place to stay la
Juarez, and go to and fro each day
during the season.
As might be expected Juares has
many gambling houses, frequented by
Americans and the shooting up seems
to have found its way Into- their blood

uncommon in which the American
sport plays a part.

Important changes In the card for
the Loughrey-Chambers fight at the
Warren ball grounds Aug. 22 were an
nounced yesterday by the Warren
District Athletic club which will add
considerable class to the preliminar
ies before the main bout. In place
of Queno and Lundy, oris of the six
round curtain raisers will be between
Koob and Lundy.
Koob surprised the "fans" at the
Douglas fights a week ago when he
pulled a remarkable "come back,"
After being knocked down and taking
the count he managed to get to his
feet before the gong rang and In the
last round won from his Indian op
ponent by a knockout. Koob and
Lundy, both willing boys, should
show the local enthusiasts a whirl
wind scrap.
A six-round bout also has been ar
ranged between Johnny Hughes and
Vaughn, while the other six-round
preliminary will be between Johnny
Meyers and "Dusty" Rhodes. Jack
McDonald of El Paso will referee.
There will be considerable wager
ing on the main event. Chambers' ad
mirers at Douglas having announced
that they would come well heeled,
while a number ot Bisbee sportsmen
who have seen Loughry in action will
not miss the chance to get a wager
down on bjm.
The Warren District Athletic club
is being congratulated on the ex

has arranged and predictions are
made that a record-breaking crowd
for this section will be in attendance.

GORMAN-, Tex... Aug. 9. A new
period of development is opened to
the citizens of Gorman through the
achievements of the neighboring; oil
fields. Numerous new buildings are
being planned with an idea of hous
ing . new concerns rapidly being
drawn to this city. The new hotel
recently leased by competent and ex
perienced parties will be open to
patrons in the early fall. Numerous
supply houses are opening here for
large operators are inclined to be
lieve that Gorman is the coming city
of the Gorman-Desdemona district.
Business is in a congested condi
tion, but business men cooperating
with the chamber of commerce be
lieve they will soon destroy the
hindrance to progress. The Katy
railroad is coping with the present
situation in such a way as to hasten
supplies to and from the field as no
other railroad in the oil fields ot
Texas have been able to do bo, so far.
Owing to the unlimited water sup
ply, it is believed by the citizens of
Gorman that their city will be an
ideal spot for manufacturing. The
Chamber of commerce has invited all
manufacturing concerns interested to
look over the situation. There is also
an unlimited supply of oil and gas for
fuel used here.
The Mutual Machine and Tool Co.
has completed its building and is now
installing machinery and will begin
operations in the near future.
Final arrangements have been
made by Warren Waggoner for the
new loading track for oil shipments
from the Duke field.
The Waggoner-Terrell well No. 2
is now two feet in the sand and is
producing 2000 barrels of oil dally.
The company plans to ship this oil
from Gorman, but local refineries are
making every effort to secure the oil
for the refineries here. Should they
succeed, the deal will prove a very
profitable one to the stockholders of
the Gorman refineries. j
The Gorman Gas Co. has three miles!
of Its line laid from the Central
Texas gas well toward Gorman. This
company expects to have the mains
in this city started within a few days
and it is thought that the line will
be ready for operation within the
next 60 days.
The county bond issues, which the
people of Eastland county are ex
pected to vote on within a short
time, indicate the great and perman
ent development of the county. The
chamber of commerce of Gorman is
campaigning to have the issues
passed.
The well on the Perry land, one
and a half miles southeast of Gorirr a,
is at a depth of 1600 feet.
The Moorman well, owned by the
Humble company and situated seven
miles south of Gorman, has a showing
of oil.
BOIL POOL
EXTENDS WEST
WICHITA FALLS, Texas, Aug. 9.
Gradually the field at Burkburnett is
extending further northwest, while op
erators of the southeastern part of the
field are meeting with failure.
At 2000 feet the T. P. Roberts well
of the Horse Shoe Bend Oil Associa
tion has been abandoned as dry, it is
reported. The well is more than two
miles from fne west extension of the
Waggoner pool, past the bend in the
Red river, and is practically in the
North Clara district.
There are three holes in block 75,
Renner tract, all dry below 1800 feet.
Burk Bethol No. l.Vogel, is dry at
1900 feet, block 74, Re! river valley
lands.
On the other hand the northwest
blocks are showing up excellently
and acreage is rising in price north
westward. Clint Woods' No, 1, in
block 18, Greenwood subdivision, has
been completed extending the pool
somewhat. Oil men claim that the
field will go northwest a great dis
tance and they are planning opera
tions accordingly.
Proof that the Waggoner pool is by
no means playing out is in the pro
duction of the Skelly Oil Company's
No. 2 Waggoner, a 1800 barrel well,
which came in a few days ago. Wells
have been drilling and completions
have been made steadily in this
block, since the Waggoner pool was
opened and such a big producer in the
midst of bo many other producers
shows what the pool is made of.
The pipe line situation, while slow
ly improving, is not what it should
be, and is greatly hindering speedy
operations. New wells are being com
pleted and shut down after the tanks
are filled, awaiting long delayed pipe
line connections.

The board of directors of the Co

met during the week to pass on loans
for the association and general trans
action of other business. The earn
ings of the association have proved
highly gratifying to the stockholders,
who borrow money from the associa
tion. The large earnings have cut
down their time to pay out from 100
months to around 76 months which
has made their interest cost very
moderate, being a little over 5 per
cent per annum on monthly balances.
If rated on yearly balances this would
be less than 4 per cent per annum. '

We believe that the people of Fisbec will welcome the announcement that the well
known brokerage house of Douglas, Hatfield & Bradford, has decided to open an office
in this city for the benefit of the many people who are interested in stocks and bonds.
We believe that with the readjustment of industries after the war that there will
be a more active participation in this form of investment. Truth is, as every one knows,
that the ordinary safe investments were not available during the war, and Industries,
in the very nature of things could not make much progress during the war period.
It is common knowledge that the government urged, implored all but command
ed industries, aside from war projects, to forego any further development. Private
enterprises, too, of a nature that could wait, were discountenanced. The purpose, ot
course, was to concentrate energies, wealth and man power upon essentially war works.
But now the country has turned again, with vigor and public spirit to the definite
consideration of industrial developments and the revival of all enterprises. To this
combination of public spirit and natural advantages should be attributed the country's
substantial and wholesome growth in ihe past.
And this blending of energetic, progressive spirit in the country, as concentrated
in its industrial bodies with the many nd diverse resources and possibilities and at
tractive features of our industries as investments will keep the future investor inter
ested in all stocks.
Coming to Bisbee with years of experience in the stock market we are in a posi
tion to render an unusual service and advice in stock investments.
Mr. Bradford has been in this county for many years operating the brokerage office
at Douglas in the Gadsen Hotel building, and Mr. II. F. Rice, who is to conduct tho,
affairs of the Bisbee office comes from Ft. Worth where he has had a wide experience
in this line of business and will be rleascd to meet all those interested in the stock
market.
We are specializing in legitimate oil stocks, especially in the Texas oil fields, and
with our special daily quotations from our correspondents at Wichita, Dallas, Ft.
Worth. El Paso and Ranger, we are in a position to advise at any time on tho condi
tions of the various oil stocks which will be listed on our boards daily.
New York and Boston curb stocks and' bonds are listedVdaily from information re
ceived from our correspondents in those cities.
We welcome you to visit our office tomorrow on Main street, opposite the Post
olfice, and we are always at" your service.

BENSON SHELTER TO OPEN FIRST
OF SEPTEMBER; BUILDING flR SPUR
BENSON, Aug. 9. The work on
the Arizona Smelting & Power Com
pany" plant her Is "progressing rap
idly and k is now expected that the
smelter will be in operation about
the first of September. A force of
men and teams are at work now in
grading for the installation of the
new railroad spur from the Southern
Pacific lines. This work will be com
pleted within the next few days. The
work of concreting the smoke cham
bers and lead to the stack has been
completed. The big compressor has
been installed and is ready to be
started. The boilers are in place and
ready for the fires to be lighted. The
oil tank is in shape and a spur will be
continued on to it so that the oil can
be unloaded direct into the tank.
Large cement water storage tank has
been completed and already filled
with water.
The assay office and general office
; has been; fixed up by. the carpenters
and the painters were put to work
-painting the interior today. The
present furnace is capable of smelt
ing 200 tons of ore a day. Some ore
has already been received and is on
the platform and other ore 'has al
ready "been contracted for and ship
ments will commence within the
next two woeks. - - -
tTh dynamos that will furnish tUo
lights for the smelter and .for the
power lines that are to furnish power
and light for the city are on the way
and are- expected to arrive within'tho
next 10 days. . ;
R. L. Lee, who has charge of the
work at the smelter and who will
be tn charge as superintendent has
been there for several weeks. He
has recently returned from Water
bury, Connecticut, where he was shell
inspector for the Government in a mu
nition factory. He was with smelting
companies in the United States and
South America v for over eight years.
When seen by a Review representa
tive at the plant touay he was very
enthusiastic over the work that had
been accomplished and was of tho
opinion that the smelter would be
blown in about the first of Septem
ber or very soon thereafter.
Martin Fishback, who is the mana
ger of the company, is away at the
present time in the East on business
connected with the company.
To the untiring efforts of Charles
Goetz,. the enterprising Benson mer
chant, is due tiie credit for the re
sumption of work on the smelter. He
went East and spent his own money
and interested others and in the en
terprise with him. He is secretary
and treasurer of the new company. He
is greatly pleased with the showing
that has already been made and
states that after a few months' trial
and a success made of the present
plant, plans have already been made
for the increasing of the capacity to
1000 tons a day.
The smelter will afford a ' market
for the ores xt the Johnson district,
but' also for a number of mines on
the San Pedro river below Benson.
VERDE EXTN.-IN
FINE CONDIT
Stockholders In the United Verde
Extension' Minin company this week
received "their regular quorterly divi
dend, accompanying which was the
following statement from James S.
Douglas, president of the company.
Since our annual report to stock
holders as of January 1st, production
operations of the 6melter were stop
ped on February 13th, due to the low
price of copper. The works remain
ed closed down till June 9th, when
the blast furnace was blown In and
since then we have been making
about 70 tons of copper dally,
of Phoenix, which is expected to
rank among the great copper mines
of -Arizona. Mr. Hicke says that
the formation on the Coleand Good
win property is very similar to that
of the Kay, and he believes it will
develop into a good mine. P. J. Hick
ey, Jr., who has had years of ex
perience in copper mining, will direct
the work of development as superin
tendent for the Arizona-Globe com
pany.- ' He has had a small force em
ployed for some time doing prelimin
ary work and will have a larger
crew out of the property today.
The Cole and Goodwin property is
more than a prospect. The vein has
been developed by a shaft to the
depth of 470 feet, by drifts and cross
cuts fore than 700 feet in extent.
Several thousand tons of ore have
been blocked out. The shaft is to
be retimbered and all openings put
in condition for the more extensive
development that is planned. The

Van Dyke Shaft 280 Feet Deep.
The sinking of Van Dyke Shaft No.
1 is still proceeding steadily nd the
shaft has now reached a total depth
of 280 feet. Progress is averaging
about four feet per shift, but, it has
been interferred with during the past
few days by running into large boul
ders of granite contained in- the con
glomerate. These boulders vary in
size from that of an apple to a dia
meter of four feet, and by the method
of sinking employed it is possible to
work oround a majority of these
boulders and send them . to the . sur
face whole. In the case of larger
boulders it, is necessary to break them
either by ' plug ; and feathers or by
blasting. To date it has not bee a
necessary to resort to blasting.
Manager Rice "states that he does
not anticipate a very thick stratum
of these boulders for while drilling
Hole No. 1 there were only one or
two strata of boulders encountered
in the conglomerate before reaching
ore. As the shaft becomes deener
the management anticipates easier
working conditions, for according to
the log of "Hole "No. 1 the softest
formations lie immediately above the
ore.
The shaft Is making a fair amount
of water, but to date it has not been
necessary to install pumps, the water
being handled by bailing. What
water is being made is seeping in
from the sides of the shaft and prac
tically none is being made in the bot
tom. Plans are' being completed' for
the putting in of a water ring arid
pump at somewhere between 300 and
330 feet from the surface in. the upper
reaches of the shaft will be caught
and pumped to the surface. This will
make for better working conditions
and increased speed.

INN
MEN
C. K. Jacobson, Fo? Eleven Years a Miner, Tells Conditions
In Bisbee Which Led to the Elimination of the Invading
. Trouble-Makers By the Miners Who Had Sons and Brothers
In the War So That Needed Copper Could Be Furnished U. S.
"The I. W. W. flocked Into the
Warren District In tne summer
of 1917 for the purpose of caus
ing trouble In the m:nes."
"Their so-called 'strike' was
not a strike, but a revolution
aimed at the overthrow of the
United States government at
war."
"No vote was taken on the
strike it was cajled by about six
of the I. W. W. leaders. Had a
vote been taken, less than 20 per
cent -of the men In the mines
would have voted in favor of a
walk out."
"Decent labor was not only
satisfied with working conditions
in the district, but was anxious
to accomplish the utmost in the
production of war copper."
"When the limits of tolerance
had been reached, decent labor,
by due process of law, removed
the I. W. W. trouble-makers from
the district."
"By doing this, labor not only
made possible ' a maximum pro
duction of copper needed by the
American boys at the war front,
but undoubtedly saved the War.
ren District from, a reign of in
timidation and violence, includ
ing 'bloodshed and heavy loss of
property and life." .
"Thus underground men of the
Bisbee mines put the so-called
deportations across... Without
these miners it would have been
impossible to rid the district of
the I. W. W. menace."
If you should ask C. K. Jacobson
; .. 1. r i
msucc, iur eieven years a miner
in tne Warren District, and one ol
me men now facing charces of ttd
naping in the courts of Cochise coun
ty ror his participation in the "de
portations." the above is the pith of
wnai ne win tell you. And Jacobson
Voices the' sentiment of 99 per cent
of both miners and citizens in the
district. " '
Jacobson ia in a position to know
whereof he speaks, for it was he who
made a man-to-man canvass of the
district at the time of the I. W. W.
strike back ins 1917. and found a re-
marKaDie unanimity of sentiment
among the miners in favor of 'remain
ins at work; It was he who sent
telegram to Charles H. Moyer, presi
uem or me western Federation of
Miners, and received in reply an em
pnauc assurance that the I. W. W.
strike in the Eisbee mines was "not
sanctioned by any bona fide oreanlza
tion of labor"; it was he who pleaded
strenuously, but in rain, with the
radicals against calling the strike;
ana ne, rinany, who induced large
numDers or the men to brave the
threats of the I. W. V. and return
to work after the strike had been
called.
I. W. W. Labor's Greatest Foe.
From extensive first-hand experi
ence with the I. W. W. and its meth
ods of violence in California, Jacob
son knew the breed. For years a
union miner, he recognized the I. W.
W. as organized labor's greatest foe.
He was 'working in the Southwest
shaft in the Warren District when. In
the early summer of 1917, he scented
trouble from afar. ;
"Shortly after the United States
entered the great war, and began
sending American boys overseas to
face death on the battle feild. every
hobo in the country seemed to start
flocking into the Warren District"
says Jacobson. "They were men who
had never worked if thev mniH hein
patriotic miners during that troubled
summer of 1917. But he admits
readily enough his share in remov
ing the I. W. W. menace from the dls
wti. ana lr pressed, will tell the
story.
Working shoulder to shoulder with
Jacobson in his fight to stamn nut
the growing I. W, W. dinger before
ever the strike stage was reached,
was his friend and fellow-miner Tom
J. White, now Lieutenant White ot
me united States Marine Corps, eta
nonea in me west Indies then
worxer in the Briggs shaft in this
district. Both men of vision, Jacob-
ison ana. wntte saw the firBt approach
ui irouDie, and put their heads to
gether to avert it.
I. W. W. Deaf to Reason.
"I tried to talk the invading rad
icais out or the strike," said Jacob-
son, i told them thev were otrib-
ing at the wrong time; that there was
noming to their so-called "demands

wanted to strike, they had made up
their minds to strike under any cir

was to it.
wnite and I knew the sentiment
or me men fn the mine. We knew
mey wanted no strike. We knew
mey were satisfied with conditions

their wages and general working con

"Despite all this, the
called. Not by the men if n Hai?t
had been taken, the strike would
have been lost by over 5 to 1 but!
termined that the Briggs shaft was
a good place to begin our effort.
"Thus we began a man-to-man can
vass of the men who prior to the
strike had been working In the Priggs
shaft. In three days we talked per
sonally to 150 men. We found that
practically every one of them wanted
to return to work that all of them
were simply-"laying low", as Tom
and I, were doing.
"So we went ahead and had posters
printed, announcing tha there would
be a meeting of the Briggs miners in
Brophy's Hall at Lowell on the even
ing of Sunday, July 1. We scattered
these posters all over the Warren
District." .
Jacobson paused and smiled remln
iscently a smile not devoid of the
battle glint.
"That was some meeting," he
chuckled. "I thought we were in for
a licking that night."
"Wobblies" Turn Out in Force.
Then came the memorable Sunday
night and the meeting but a meet
ing different from that planned by
Jacobson and White.
"The street in front of Brophy's
Hall was jammed," continued Jacob
rnLv, "Yes" Iiteray jammed with
Wobbhes. One would have thought
that every I. W. W. in the United
States had come down to give that
meeting a send-off.
"The result, naturally enough! ws
that the men we really wanted the
decent laboring men were afraid to
come into the hall. Tom and I sat
at the door of the hall, armed with
a quantity of strike ballots. Eight
men in all ran the gauntlet of the
I. W. W. crowd and came up. To
each we handed a ballot. Of the
eight, when we examined the ballots
later, we found that several had voted
against the strike called by the Wob
blies, and one infavor.

Recognize I. W. W. Blow at Labor
"Decent laborine

where they stood." said Jacobson.
They recognized that the T. w w

that it had not the sanction of the
American Federation of Labor; that
is Was a blOW Struck at lahnr tint tnr
labor; and they returned to their jobs.
c-very aay saw more and more men
returning to the various shafts.
Thus began a 1 general wakin-nn
to a realization of what the I. W. W.
really are a general -unmasking of
the enemy within the gate.' And hon-
est indignation began to gather force
in the breasts of the miners.
But the arrogant I. W. W.. flushed
with' their earlier taste nf viMnrv
"The men who, on July 12, 1917.
rid the district of labor's enemies,
were all duly authorized by the- sher
iff. Everyone of us was deputized.
"I should say that ninety per cent
of the men working in the mines were
in on the deportations took an ac
tive part in rounding up the Wobblies
and their sympathizers, and shipping
them out of the district. Possibly
the percentage was higher than this.
The only working miners who were
not in on it were those who could not
possibly get awa from their jobs.
Allied Crafts Help Round-Up.
"Besides the '-"miners and muckers,
men of the allied crafts took part in
the round up. ' These included ma
chinists, boilermakers and electri
cians, all of whom had voted, by an
overwhelming majority, to remain on
the job when the I. W. W. strike was
called. . ;
"The deportations were conducted
with admirable ! order and lack of a
display of animosity, or any rough
handling on the part of the deporters
a fact all the more remarkable
when it is known that what the min
ers had. for days been feeling in their
hearts was a desire to take ' tho
principal leaders of the Wobblies out

was the existence :of this sentiment
on both sides that makes me say that
Sheriff Wheeler's timely action un
doubtedly saved bloodshed. j
"Now the I. W. W. are trying to'

"Kidnappers" Worked in; Mines for!
Years. i
Jacobson seized a list of the men i
now 'charged with "kidnaping", and
began picking from it, at random, the ;
names of miners. The first dame his,
eyo fell upon was that" of a man who
had worked in the Warren district j
mines . for , 23 years. The next mani
had worked here 16 years, a third
17 years, and a. fourth 40 years. Downj
one .column of the list the terms of:

- "Of the 1100 or more I. W. W. mem
bers, sympathizers and agitators in
the Warren district, only between 400
and 450 were working in the mines
on the 4ay before the . strike. Of
those thus working, nearly all were
tough characters; men, as I know
personally,, carrying the 'Red Card'.
"The question is what were these
700 other non-working I. W. W. mem-j
bers and sympathizers doing in the
district? Simply causing trouble.
There was plenty of work in the
mines. There were jobs for. every
one of them. . Why were they not
working before the strike was called?
I. W. W. Call Gompers Scab.
"I have seen the I. W. W. in action
for years in California. Out there
they are continually talking about
blowing up somebody or something.
They are no friends of labor. The I.
W. W. has said, not once,' but hun
dreds of times, that 'Samuel Gompers
is the biggest scab in the country.'
All labor leaders of consequence have
condemned the I. W. W. and all labor
Journals. It has had its fight with
the American Federation of Labor,
the Western Federation of Miners,
and every other bonafide labor or
ganization of any proportions. Even
such men as Eugene V. Debs and
Victor Berger have condemned its
purposes and its methods
"The I. W. W. invasion of the War
ren District in 1917 was part of their
scheme to create a nation of I. W. W
They thought they say' their chance
while the government's hands were
tied in the war. Beyond this they
had no interest in the war they did
not care anything about the ideals In
volved in the war, Just so they achiev
ed their selfish purposes.
I. W. W. Gone, Splendid Record Made
"But the loyal miners of the War
ren district has sons and brothers in
that war. Furthermore, they were
otism and honest labor ideals. That
is why, as war supporters and patri
ots, the decent laboring men of the
district by legal means drove the I.
W. W. with his anti-war schemes
forth. And, finally, they justified the
"deportations" by their splendid war
record of copper production through
out the eighteen months :'o the sign
ing of the armistice wnn Germany,
after they had removed from ihe dis
trict the alien I. W. W. menace."

T
PROFESSIONAL BAD SPORTSMEN.
HE FOLLOWING editorial, appealing in the Denver Labor
Bulletin is from the pen of W. J. Ghent, who, as former sec
retary to Victor Berger, evidently got his fill of radicalism
in its various forms, and knows whereof he speaks:
"PROFESSIONAL BAD SPORTSMEN
"When an I. W. W. or Other Super-Radical Stubs His Toe He Runs to
Some High-Brow Journalistic Mama For Consolation.
"The I. W. W.'s and their cousins-in-arms, the super-radicals of
the metropolitan areas, are anything but good sportsmen. They do
not play the game according to the long-accepted rules.
-They declare themselves the makers of their own morality; they
dismiss all notions of rights as mere 'bourgeois notions and maintain
that power is the only determiner of right; they assert their defiance
of the government, its laws and its courts; they proclaim that anything
they choose to do in the holy name of the working class (of which,
by the way, they are in no sense representatives) is justified merely
becanse they choose to do it. They set themselves up as a sovereign
power, ready and eager to combat the assumption of sovereign powe?
on the part of the government.
"It is all very thrilling to those who take it seriously. But it is
not o be so taken. ' A good sportsmaa should be a good loser.
"Do these "revolutionists," when the government accepts their
defiant challenge and lay hands on them, philosophically gulp their;
medicine?
"They do not. Their first act is to utter a series of vociferous
protests against the alleged violation of their rights, and their second
is to run and tell their trouble to The New Republic and The Nation.
The mothering sympathy and ministration of these two journals in
such cases is lavish and unfailing.
"The 'revolutionist' with a bumped head knows as well as the
child with a stubbed toe just where mollycoddling comfort is to be
had, and he seeks it as promptly and as eagerly as does the other.
v "This pitiful sequel is not what the world has the right to ex
pect. When a 'revolutionist poses as Ajax defying the lightning he
should' live up to his pose. If the lightning, resentful of this defiance,
shies a bolt in his direction and keels him over, his first thought
should not be to set up a howl and his second to run to some high
brow journalistic mama for consolation.
"He should, if he is the real stuff, stoically accept the result he
courted; he should pick himself up, pull himself together and re
mark: "Well, Mr. Lightning, that's one on me. guess I didn't
really appreciate what might happen.'
"After which, a wiser and a better man, he may profitably re
flect that the Ajax pose, while ecstatically thrilling to the Reginalds
and Esmeraldas. of the coteries, is not without danger and is apt to
prove highly ridiculous as well.
"The catch-phrases, holy words, postulates and premises of these
fervent 'revolutionists are ridiculous enough in the first place. But
even an absurd cause may tak? on a semblance of dignity and worth
through the unflinching, consistent, live-or-die cfevotion of its dis
ciples. "These 'revolutionists,' however, are anything but consistent.
They want the game played according to one set of rules for them
selrts and a quite different Bet for the other side.
"It spite of the old adage that a person cannot have his cake
and eat it too, they demand a cake which, though voraciously .con
sumed, perpetually renews itself.
"They want to defy the constitution in security and to appeal to
it in danger.
"They want to disregard the observance of laws and standards of
right that, lay restraints upon themselves but to hold the other side
to strict construction aad accountability.
"They want a free hand in the use of force in furthering their
own aims, but an abolition of force on the part of those who disagree
with them.
"They have no conception of a mutuality of right; what is justifi
able for them is wrong for everybody else.
"They want all the advantage in a game intended to harm others;
and when they themselves are hurt they howl.
"They are therefore the professional bad sportsmen. Every con
cession made to them means the impairment of the rights of man
kind as a whole everywhere."
CHURCH.
THIS IS a free editorial advertisement for all the churches in
this town.
It is written to those of us not in the habit of attending
church.
Today let us put on our good clothes and go to church some
church and even though we may not be subscribers to any sect or
creed.
Omitting all spiritual arguments from consideration just now, let
us go to church today with the idea of studying the church as an in
stitution and what it means to the individual and to he community
in material benefits.
The church has existed for a good many centuries.
It would not have existed for all this time without having some
place in the schemeof nature and for benefit to humanity.
To those of us w ho go" to church today, and who have not been in
the habit of going, we think that the general attendance will be
found' made up of the industrious, thrifty and more prosperous of
the community.
And if this is true, why, the church has had some effect in mak
ing them so.
While it is true that all prosperous people do not go to church,
yet the church haa In its time had its effect upon these through
their parents in giving them the right start in life or through tho
general establishment of good order and prosperity, and thereby in
creasing community opportunity.
The church has at all times stood for gciod morals, honesty and
justice.
And all of these are the devices that go to make industry, thrift,
prosperity and happiness.
Good morals are at all times good economics ail generally ac
cepted moral practices were good economics at some one time or
place.

months of the war.
battle raged practically without In
terruption from July 18th to ftov.
11th, 1918. The story of a few of the
divisions has been touched upon be
fore, but now for the first time it is
possible to present a connected and
unified narrative of it from official
sources.
Wat Great, Final Offensive
It was in this great final, offensive
that Marshal Foch paid the American
forces the compliment of letting them
bear the brunt of the German counter
offensive, "a veritable hell of cannon
fire, and this narrative describes
them smashing through line after
line of the enemies defensives and
driving Grmany'B proudest troops
'into positions of such peril that the
petition for an armistice was the
only logical solution.
In this story I have attempted to
tell along general lines of thq Meuse-
Argonne battle. It is manifestly im
possible to give adequate space to
every phase of that battle or the role
played by every individual unit. Some
of the official reports on this opera
tion had not yet been completed when
I was visiting this battlefield for in
formation in April, 1919, and there
fore the statistics are as complete
only as they could be made at that
time.
American Army Achievement
The Meuse-Argonne battle will al
ways stand out as the supreme
achievement of the American army In
France. Other operations, such as
the assistance we lent the French
In stopping tjie great Oeifinan;"dr!yt
toward Paris, and the suppression, of
the St. Mihlel salient, are no doubt
' more spectacular in the public eye,
but the part which the American
army played in the last - great offen
sive of the war is that by which it
will be judged in future years.
There is a paragraph in the In
fantry drill regulations to which the
attention of all soldiers is called. It
reads about as follows:
"The ultimate purpose of all mili
tary training is success in the battle.
This purpose should always be Kept
uppermost in mind and all efforts
should be directed to this end."
Wat Crowning U. S. Effort
Taking this axiom in , Us larger
sense we may apply it in this way
the ultimate purpose of all training
in the camps at home and in France,
completed by the training .in actual
warfare which our troops received at
Cantigny, at Chateau Thierry and
later at St. Mihiel was the battle
lasting from September 26th to No
vember 11th in which we broke
through the German lines, forced
him to retreat behind the Meuse
river and with the aid of our Allies
compelled him to demand an armis
tice. It wascnly on September 26th,
when the First American Army took
its place alongside the Armies of its
Allies, that we were prepared for the
supreme effort, to which every of
ficer and soldier in the A .E. F. had,
looked forward. For the first time
in our history large units of foreign
troops were operating under Ameri
can command. All operations that
preceded the Meuse-Areonne battle
were preparatory and if they stand
out by themselves it is only as an
earnest effort- of what the American
army as a whole could do.
No such concentration of American
trocps had ever been seen before in
our history, while the character or
the fighting was as bitter as any en
gaged in by the troops of our Allies
throughout the entire war. Yet the
young American Army, functioning
normally for the first time in all its
different branches. accomplished
what six months before had seemed
Impossible.
To view the Meuse-Argonne battle
in its propor lifcht let us go back to
tlie early days of the Toul sector and
glance at the various stages of devel
opment from that day in the latter
part of October, 1917. when Ameri
can troops rirst appeared 'in the line.
These troops of the First Division,
had been trained with the aid of
French troops and when they reached
the front Iine.tbev were engfr enough
to show their fighting qualities. Fnt
each successive experience proved
that there was much to be learned
about modern warfare that could not
be taught in a training camp.
Cantigny Was Development step
Thr. Ei.mnH Ktpnnine-st one in the
development of the American Army
was Cantigny.. where thf same troops,
the First Division, first took part in
an offensive action. The Commander-in-Chief
thus describes that affair:
"Although local, this brilliant ac
tion had an electrical ttfect, as it
demonstrated our righting qualities
under extreme battle conditions, and
not altogether invincible."
By this succesful stroke at Cantig-
the closing! ny our Allies saw full proof that the
This gigantic j American army was a mighty force
in the making.
U. S. Soldier "Arrives"
This proof was confirmed at Bel
leau Wood and at Chateau Thierry on
the Marne. It was confirmed with
great emphasis because American
troops (2nd and 3rd Divisions) were
thrown into the fight to block the
German advance on Paris at a mo
ment when the situation was most
critical and when the French people
looked to us for protection. That
these divisions did stop the enemy
and when the time came played a
prominent part in driving him back to
the Vesle river gave our troops justi
fied confidence in themselves and
prepared them for what was to fol
low. The American soldier ' had
"arrived" in the estimation of his
French and British comrades but the
American Army had yet to be tried
out.
Because of the brilliant work of the
First Division at Cantigny and the
Second at Belleaa Wood these two
units were given the place of honoi
together with a French division as
the spearhead of the great counter
offensive of July 18th. In the fight
5ng which followed several other
American divisions won glory for
themselves - and their commanders.
Our troops in the Chateau-Thierry
sector operated under the command
of the Sixth and Tenth French Armies
mam learned of our plant this opera
tion was carried out with the great
est success and despatch to that 27
hours after the attack' began the St.
Mihiel talient had disappeared.
- Frontal Attack Necessitated.
The enemy's line from the North
Sea to Switzerland now presented no
weak spot, as all salients had been
reduced, first the Chateau Thierry
salient, then the Montdidier salient
and the pretuberance farther north in
the direction of the channel ports,
and lastly the St. Mihiel Balient. With
no more salients to reduce the Al
lied High Command was compelled to
stage a frontal attack. And in view
of the general situation, the lowered
enemy morale, the depletion of his
effectives and other things, it was
determined to launch a general of
fensive along the entire line. It was
certain that the enemy would put up
his strongest defense at the two
wings of his line, that it, in the region
south of Lille and around Verdun.
At these points his defenses were
the strongest and the most numerous.
It was certain, too, that the troops

Pivot of Important Operation.
This battlefield stretching between
the Argonne forest and the Meuse
river has played a prominent role in
the war since its beginning. It has
been-the pivot of important . opera
tions elsewhere rather than a field
of maneuver. - In 1914 when the Ger
man armies pouring south from Mont
medy reached the line on which the
battle of the Marne was fought the
pivot of that line was the fortress of
Verdun. Even though it was sur
rounded on three sides, all German
efforts to crush this pivot failed. In
September 1914, the French armies,
fighting along the heights of Sivry,
7iV
V r m : ' ; -n test -
pivoted on two points, Montfaucon,
west of the river, and the twin
heights of Ornes on the east. Be
cause of the fact that they are splen
did observatories these positions are
of particularly great value from
military point of view. It will be re
called that the Verdun battle began
on February 21, 1916, and continued
with almost no let-up until late that
year. As .the result of heavy fighting
and stupendous . losses he Germani
succeeded in getting as far south as
the forts of Douaumont and Vaux.
After capturing these positions they
penetrated to the village of Fleury
and even got into the fosse of Fort
Souvllle. This was the extreme point
of -their advance.
On the .left bank of the 'Meuse the
! rrman nnprfltfnne Krninct Varrlnn
did not begin until the month of
May, 1916. These operations had for
their primary purpose to join up the
line with the advanced . line on the
right bank of the river and . second
arily to close in on Verdun by cap
turing the formidable heights of Hill
304 and Dead Man's Hill. The Ger-!
mans did succeed in taking these
heightsat the cost of great sacrifices
but they were unable to hold thent.
The French losses, too, had been
very heavy on both sides of the rlv.er.
During the battle every division in
the French army passed through, the
fire at 'Verdun. Whole regiments
were wiped out even before coming
in contact with, the German infantry,
so great was the artillery fire. Vet

in the Meuse-Argonne battl e.
The First American Army, (which
was to have taken over the sector 'at
Fismes) was then forming at La
Ferte scus Jouarre. The plan then
contemplated was tq make thi3 army
yery small, containing about six divi
sions. However on
never functioned as an army because
the Staff was transferred to Ligny-en-Barrois
for the St. Mihiel opera
tion. St. Mihiel First Independent Action.
We now come to the St. Mihiel bat-
losses and of all the Allied armies
the young American army was the
only one which could support the
necessary losses. It is a source of
great pride to the American army
comrrtanders that our troops who had
just completed their final test in the
battle of St. Mihiel were chosen for
this difficult operation. We knew the
difficulties we had before us and we
i knew also with what desperation the
enemy would oppose us but we felt
confident in victory. That we won is
due to the brilliant leadership of our
chiefs and, a3 one division has put it

most important part in throwing back

Stellung. the Kriemhilde Stellung and
the Freja Stellung, that the Ameri
can army launched its attack.
All these linos of defense followed
the heights, depending on the natural
strength of the positions on which
they were built. The llindenburg,
Ilagen and Kriemhilde Stellungs
were the principal lines of defense;
the others were local lines destined
to defend "particular positions. iThe
principal lines ' above-named were
solidly concreted and wired the lat
est word in defensive warfare as ex
perience since 1914 had taught it.
Was Crux of All Hun Operations
One may ask why the German de
fensive system' was constructed in
this way. The answer i3 very simple.
To win the war Germany must have
undisturbed access to the inexhaust
ible coal fields of northern France
and Belgium as well as to the iron
mines of Lorraine and therefore she
had to build her defenses so as to
cover these territories. In addition
she- had to protect the . great double
track (in places four track) railroad
line running from Lille to Metz along
the Franco-Belsian frontier. This
line was as important to her as either
the coal or iron fields for the rea
son that by it she could move rapidly
large numbers of troop3 from one
front to another. This ability to
shift troops and supplies by interior
railway lines was responsible more
than anything else for Germany's
early successes, both in offense and
defense. In other words from a mili
tary point o'-view Germany's strategic
success depended on the Lille-Metz
railway line and her economic suc
cess on the coal fields of Belgium
and Franco and the iron field of Lor
raine. Without either one or the
other she was doomed, to defeat.
This main transversal line of com
munication, was fed In the north by
the immense railroad system running
through; Liege and in the south by the
lines running through Luxemburg.
Owing sto the topography these are
the main arteries running Into France
from the north and northeast and It
was through these two main arteries
that all Jroops and all, supplies came
'into France.
Foe Forced to Shorten Line
When the lack of man-power com
pelled' the' German high command to
envisage the approaching necessity
cf a shortening of the line and this
lack of man-power became evident in
May, 1918, the question of carrying
out successfully this shortening of
the line became all important. Ow
ing to the fact that the territory of
Holland juts southward into Belgium
close to Liege the great percentage
of German troops in France must re
treat by the southern artery above
described. Therefore the German
army must necessarily hold to the
last in order to guarantee the suc-
CeSSiUl wimuranaroi iroups'iuiiuw
west and north. In fact, the Meuse
Argonne front was the hinge j on
which the entire German retreat
swung and being the hinge it was
solidly fortified to resist all attacks.
It is a source of great pride to the
American army and its chiefs that we
were given the honor of attacking
this point in the German line, which,
we knew, would be more solidly held
and more desperately defended than
any other. Marshal Foch paid us the
compliment of giving us the most
difficult and perhaps the most tin-
grateful task in the great offensive
that continued almost without inter
ruption from July 18th to the signing
of the armistice. By continually
pounding on the system of fortifica
tions lying between the Argonne ana
the Meuse the American army was
first able to lessen the enemy's re
sistance on the French and British
fronts and secondly, our perseverance
was crowned with the greatest sue
cess hoped for. When we succeeded
in bringing the great main commun
eating line under fire of our light
guns the enemy had to withdraw be
vond the Meuse. Only then did he
see disaster staring him in the face
To stave off this disaster he signed
the terms of the armistice.
The Battle From the Enemy's Side
It is very evident from all informa
tion obtained that the German high
command knew of our preparations
for an attack on a large scale. The
Germans Air Service and Information
Service- had warned them that we
were making preparations for a big
attack but because of the fact, that
we had only two weeks before re
duced the St. Mihiel salient they be
lieved that our principal effort would
be directed against Metz. Orders
captured Sept. 26th showed that the
enemy was preparing to meet an
American attack east of the Meuse
and he therefore had massed large
forces to protect the Briey iron basin
and the Metx area.'
The importance to the Germans of
holding the line from the Argonne to
the Mens is no better shown than In
the following secret order of General
von der Marwitz, commanding the
Fifth Army, which was captured.
Secret Order of General Von Der
Marwitz, Commanding the German
Fifth Army, Dated September 15th.
"According to information in our
hands the enemy intends to attack
the Fifth Army east of the Meuse in
order to reach Longuyon. The ob
jective of this attack is the cutting
of the railroad line Longuyon-Sedan
which is the main line of communica
tion of the Western Army.
"Furthermore the enemy hopes to
compel us to discontinue the exploita
tion of the iron mines of Briey, the
possession of which is a great factoi
In our steel production.
"The Fifth Army once again may
have to bear the brunt of the fighting
of the coming weeks on which the
security of the Fatherland may de
pend. The fate of a large portion of
the Western Front, perhaps of our
nation, depends on the firm holding of
he Verdun front. The Fatherland be
lieves that every commander and
every soldier realizes the greatness
of his task, and that everyone will
fulfill his duty to the utmost. If
this is done the enemy's attack will
be shattered."
It will be seen from this order that
the enemy judged correctly our in
tentions, first to cut the Longuyon
Sedan railroad line, and secondly, to
harass and if possibye discontinue the
exploitation of the Briey iron mines.
Concerning the first. General von der
Marwitz says that the railroad lin
is the main line of communication of
the western army. He further says
that the possession of the Briey iron
mines is a great factor in the steel
production of Germany. These two
were of prime importance to Ger,
many's success in the war. Her en
tire defensive system in northern
France was based on this great rail
way system since by this means she
had always been able to shift troops
quickly from one front to another. In
modern warfare the success of any
defense' depends to a great extent
upon this ability for rapid move
ment.
Held Four-Fifths Europe's Iron.
The Briey iron basin contains four
fifths of all tho iron ore in' Contin
ental Europe. In the remaining fifth
there must be included the ore in
Sweden, Russia and other regions. It
follows, therefore, that Germany to
be successful must hold on to and
be able to use' this iron basin. The loss
of it would have meant a speedy end
to the war. i
It is readily seen, therefore,' that of
all sectors of the Western front that
which the Americans were to attack
was .to the enemy the most important
and the most vitaL The strategists
on the side of the Allies knew that
the war would be won when the
Longuyon Sedan railroad had been
cut and that the cutting of thfs line
would soon force the enemy to give
up his hold on the Briey iron basin.
That is to say, if the enemy had not
signed the armistice he would have
been forced in the new attack plan
ned for November 14th to surrender
unconditionally On November 11th,
the date the armistice. . was signed,
this railroad line was already cut and
American and French troops were
massed for the new attack which
would have isolated Metz. Our in
telligence reported that the enemy
had only one fresh division on the
entire western front with which to
block our attack.
Huns Used 46 Divisions in Vain.
From September 26th to November
11th the enemy used 46 different di
visions in the line againts us. Of
these, 13 were engaged a second time
and two a third time. Of these 46
divisions 15 were first class shock
divisions, so that the enemy threw In
against us one third of his total
forces in France. On the front west
of the Meuse 15 German divisions
were engaged from, the local reserve.
Twenty-three diviisons came from
fronts, 17 from the French front, five
from the American line and one from
the British front. East of the Meuse
as far as Fresnes, or to the eastern
limit of the First Army sector, six
teen enemy divisions were engaged
from the local reserve and three from
the French front.
Looking at these statistics in an
other way. we see that only four
enemy divisions were withdrawn to
the French front, one division was
withdrawn because of the Austrian
armistice and four went to the other
American front. Twenty-seven divi
sions went back to the local reserve.
These figures show conclusively the
value of our attack to our Allies' of
fensive in Champagne and In the
north.
Another reason why the American
attack was of vital importance to the
Germans was that it threatened one
of the two main arteries of supply
leading from Germany into France
In order to safeguard the troops op
posing the French and British armies
it was imperative for General von der
Marwitz to hold his positions, doubly
so because reduced man-power was
compelling the German high com
mand to shorten its front and the
only way to shorten the front was to
swing the entire-line in a northeast
erly direction on von der Marwitz's
army as a pivot. If this pivot should
crumble before the line had been
swung back the German' armies faced
disaster. '
Every Branch Rear Service Exhausted
Allied experts have figured that on
the German side a division was not
entirely withdrawn from the line un
i til it had total losses of 3,000. This
rule had heretofore been followed
closely but in the last few weeks of
the Meuse-Argonne battle-, there was
no attempt to keep the German troops
in sufficient reserve and everything
was thrown in without regard to for
mer standards. There were evidences
os early as last May that the Ger
mans were beginning to suirer irom
lack of man-power. A specialist in
the French army predicted threo
month9 before the time when the
Germans mit in their class of 1920
that such a move would be made
This class began to appear in the
front lines in October but strict or
ders had been Issued by Ludendorff
to withdraw these young men and
keep them at the recruit depots as
thev were to hvae been used, being
tho only material available, for of

divisions un to some semblance of
fiehtine strength the Germans too
the other alternative that of dissolv
inn a ereat number of divisions. This
began last May and continued steadily
so that by November 1 thirty-one di
visions had thus been broken up. In
addition to this reinforcements were
sent into the line during the course
of the Meuse-Argonne battle from all
sorts of auxiliary services, telephon
itsts, heavy artillerymen, etc., in an
endeavor to fill up the gaps in their

Americans Struck at All Points.
In . the last few weeks of the
Meuse-Argonne battle our chiefs ob
served the phenomenon of the Ger
mans sending their reinforcements
directly into the line instead of fol
lowing what had been formerly the
invariable rule of withdrawing a shat
tered division for replacements and
training behind the lines. In several
cases the units of a division oppeared
at different places in the line. This
was due to the urgent necesisty of
stopping the gaps with whatever
troops were available at the moment.
Our attack never slackened. Each
day brought an advance in one part
or another of the battle line and each
day brought a threat from a new quar
ter for the Germans. Consequently
it was necessary for the German
command to move quickly whatever
troops were available to. the threat
ened point.' This continued shifting
of troops within the battle area
caused great confusion. One notable
instance of this was when the 45th
Reserve Division which had been
resting in Alsace was entrained for
Flanders on September 27th. The
seriousness of our attack west of the
Meuse could then be judged by the
enemy and. he was able to stop three
trains carrying troops of this division
and divert them to the Argonne front.
The troops of this division, therefore,
appeared simultaneously at several
places opposite us, making the prob
lem of control and supply of these
units increasingly difficult.
In various other instances the re
serve regiment or a division was
shifted out of its sector to aid a divi
sion on its flank. All these things
showed the great need of man-power
behind the enemy's line. On Novem
ber 11th, the day the armistice was
signed, the enemy had 41 divisions
in reserve. Of these 41 divisions only
one had been out of the line for the
necessary period of rest, that is, one
month. The others had either been
just taken out or had been rested
from a few days to a week or two and
according to the generally accept
standards were unfit for offensive ac
tion.
Hun Morale Lowered.
It is seen from the above that on
the day of the opening of our great
battle, which was launched in con
junction with attacks by our allies
along the entire front, the Germans
had at their disposal only a limited
supply of reserves, a supply which
was fast dwindling. In addition to
thi3 there must be considered the
fact that the German morale since
early in August had appreciably low
ered so that the German fighting man
of September 26th was by no means
the same man who advanced against
the British and French on March 21
He had lost faith in his cause and he
knew that the great peace offensive
had failed. War-weary and disheart
ened as he was, he faced the disagree
able task of endeavoring to stave off
complete defeat at the hands of the
enemy numerically superior and sup
ported by the faith in victory that
only a long series of successes can
give. 1 . . .
It is certain that up to November 1
the Germans expected to break down
our offensive by the stubbornest ma
chine gun and aiftillery defense that
has been known since the beginning
of the war. The enemy delivered
only local counter-attacks but he took
full advantage of every position which
could be organized for defense. When
our new attack of November 1 began
the enemy still hoped to hold us off.
To do this he threw in three new di
visions on November 1, three more
on November 2 six on November 3
two on November 4 and three on
November 5. Then he saw that
withdrawal behind the Meuse was in
evitable and he attempted in the next
few days to extricate his badly tang
led troops from the vety dangerous
position in which they found them
selves. In this connection, it Is a
point of interest to note that the Ger
man communique on November 1 ad
mitted for the first time in four and
a half years of war that their line
hnd been broken through. The Brit
ish at Cambral broke through the
first two German lines but the third
held long enough for the necessary
reinforcements to arrive.

Five Divisions Previously Used
Tho German line from the Argonne
to the Meuse on September 26th was
held by five divisions. From east
to west they were the 7th Reserve
Division, the 17th Reserve, the First
Guard, the Second Landwehr and the
9th Landwehr. Only one of these
'divisions was a first-class unit, the
Guard Division, which, having suf
fered severely at other points on the
front had been sent to the Meuse
Argonne region for what was expect
ed to be a rest. This division was
commanded by Prince Eitel Friede
rich, the Kaiser's second son, who
had the rank of major-general. This
division came from the Russian front
in the latter part of 1917 and early
last year went through a course ot
training in open warfare for the great
March offensive. Later it took part
in the advance to the Marne where it
had hard fighting. It crossed the
Marne on July 15th in the attack
agoinst Epernay and Chalons but suf-
ferred severely in the heavy fighfingj
that preceded the breaking up of that
offensive. ' Because of the brilliant '
part that this division had taken in
the Chemin des Dames offensive of
May 27th Prince Eitel was raised to
the rank of major-general.
The Seventh Reserve Division took
part In the Somme offensive near
Lassigny and also in the Aisne bat
tle. Since March 21 it had lost large
numbers in killed and wounded while
over 2,000 prisoners from this unit
alone had fallen into the hands of the
Allies. Its losses up to September
2Cth totalled more than loO per cejit.
It came to the Meuse-Argonne front
from a sector north of Soissons where
it had been engaged against' General
Mangin's army.
The 117th Reserve Division made
up of many men of Polish and Alsa
tian birth, was regarded more as a
holding than as an attacking divi
sion. It had been in Italy and early
this year had been considerably used
up by hard fighting in Flanders and
in the region of Peronne.
One Division Simply "Disappeared"
"But "of the five German Divisions
holding the. line-: west 'of the Meuse
September 26th perhaps, the most in
teresting is the Second Landwehr
which had spent "more than a year in
the Argonne Forest where there had
been no fighting since the unsuccess
ful French offensive in 1915. This
division, made up entirely or men
over 35 years of age came mostly
from Wurttemburg, had . had prac
tically no losses during all this time.
This division was never relieved as
a unit, it was merely sacrificed and
finally vanished. In the desperate
fighting in the. forest of the Argonne
against the 2Sth and 77th American
divisions the -'Second Landwehr lost
MeMvily as the fighting went on day
-d n:s"ht without rest, o-r October
28th, or a month and two days after
the battle started, this unit of old men
had been so torn to shreds that it
simply disappeared, its place being
filled by units on its flanks which
had gradually taken over its sector
to fill up gaps in its ranks.
i wo other Guard Divisions were
engaged against the Americans, the
Fifth which had already met the
Americans in the Chateau Thierry
region and the Third which had suf
fered very heavy losses, particular!
amung us oincers, in ine ngniing m
the early part of the year. Of the
other first-class divisions, engaged on
the Meuse-Argonne front especial
mention should be made of the 28th,
the Kaiser's favorite, and the 13th.
The former had always lost heavily
wherever engaged but it had always
distinguished itself. The 13th had
seen hard service from the beginning
of August, 1914, up to the time it en
tered the battle line against us. It
.had often been reconstituted but had
always been filled up with Prussians,
It was engaged in Belgium at the fall
of Liege, in Champagne, in Artois, at
"Verdun, on the Somme and on the
Chemin des Dames.
Hindenburg's Old Regiment Also
Present. :
The 52nd Division, another first-
class unit engoged against us, had a
notable, record in the Aisne offensive
this year. It was particularly dis
tinguished in the German aimy be
cause of the fact that it had only one
deserter on record. The 37th Divi
sion, which was also used, was re
garded as one of the best German
fighting units. It contained Hinden
burg's old regiment, the 147, and had
always been kept up to the highest
standard.
It is with such units as these just
named that General Von der Marwitz
built up the backbone of hi sdefense
hoping by making our advance as
costly as possible and by defending
every -hill and every wood to the last
man that the American offensive
the first great major operation in
hlch the young army from across
uie sea was engaged would come to
an end as had so many other offen
sives in this war. That he failed Is
due to the remarkable fighting quali
ties, the spirit and the determination j
of the American fighting men. '

2400 hours of service during the per

pride. .
FAMED CONTRALTO TO
SING IN BISBEE
The news that Carolina Lazarri, a
young but consiiciously successful
contralto is to be included in the
programs of the winter series spon
sored by the Musical Events Club will
be welcome to those who have been in
touch with the recent history of the
world of music. Madame Lazarri's
rise in favor of the music lovers has
been a real sensation. Few thought
that it was possible to produce a con
tralto of such excellence at this time.
But out of a somewhat depleted num
ber of contraltos came the wonder.
To har her in the district this year
gives promise of much enjoyment. In
dfd one would hardly suppose it pos
sible lo secure an attraction of such
calibre in the initial season. But it
is only a pledge of the earnest pur
pose of the club and the standard
nhich has been set for the course.
The value of such a season in the
district cannot be" estimated in any
but a vague way. While the imme
diate enjoyment will doubtless be
more than sufficient to repay the
subscribed, there will be a permanent
benefit, a broadening of the back
ground of the music lovers and a
more definite idea of the leavening in
fluence of good music in a comm
unity. No one can - afford to stand
(it ill, his vision'should be enlarged by
every means at hand and surely good
music is a-potent factor in the up
building of the fouresquare man or
woman. .

NEXT RIG DRIVE
In the steps already taken as pre
liminary to the Red Cross Drive for
funds in November, it has been de
finitely proven to the Pacific . Divi
sion , management that California,
Nevada and Arizona are proud of
what the American Red Cross has
done, and that this Division ot the
! nation's organization is behind its
peace program with heart and soul.
"We are ready to do anything the
Red Cross asks ot us," is the familiar
statement in letters that reach Divi
sion Headquarters daily from organ
ized bodies, including churches, Sun
day Schools, labor organizations,
libraries, fraternal organizations and
women's clubs. Contact has been es
tablished with these organizations,
each of which is being asked to name
committees with whom the Red Cross
may officially communicate to for
ward Red Cross projects.
Pledges of loyalty and co-operation
in the Red Cross plan which'. promise
the unqualified support of organized
bodies in the three states in the Di
vision, constitute a series of com
ments which run on the back page
of eah edition of the Pacific Division
Activities. These comments are tak
en at random from letters responding
to the request for Red Cross commit
tees in each . of the organizations
named.' The names', of committee
members themselves - also appear in
the list. ,
It is interesting to know that fra-
ternal organizations whose meetings,

j program affairs pertaining to frater
Davis will also speak i nalism aud the social life of the
lodge always find time to devote to
the Red Cross. From these organiza
tions the Red Cross has always re
ceived a hearty support.
Co-operation with the libraries
promises most important assistance,
as it is the library which constitutes
a telling point of contact with the en
tire community, particularly In rural
districts.
Labor has voiced itself in sympathy
with the Red Cross throughout the
war and letters from local unions
signify that this interest is unabated.
Church and Sunday-school support,
which has never failed, continues to
be an outspoken commendation ot
what the Red Cross has done, carry-
I ing with it a pledge for future inter
I est.
Women's clubs are looked to for
! certain continuation of the unquali-
fied interest they have maintained in
all Red Cross projects.
It is an inspiration to the manage-
, ment to read the comments from all
over the Division. It is effective
;proof 0f the loyalty of Chapters to
'.their pledge to the American Red
I Cross, that it is held so precious by
these outside organizations.

GIRLS RESERVE
LATESTFAGTQH
EE LIFE
With impressive services Wednes
day night, 132 girls were initiated
into the Girls'. Reserve, one of the
newest and most important of the Y.
W. C. A. branchpSj
Rev. Mr. Harshman gave a talk to
the girls that was instructive to both
them and the audience. Mrs. C. H.
Hunt told of the history of the Girl
Reserve movement and asked that the
mothers of the district cooperate
:
with the Y. W. C. A. in this move-
ment, so helpful to young girls. Rev. j
Mr. Kirchbaum also gave an instruc-:
tive and interesting talk, after which '
Miss Martha Greeley awarded the
arm bands, after telling of the work 1
so far accomplished in the ' Warren j
district. I
The girls sane a number of songs.
one of which, an original song by the !
Polly Anna - Corns of the Lincoln i
school, deserves special mention.
.acn corps leaaer loia oi me ,oi it :
so far accomplished by her corps, ,
gave the code of her corps and the I
flower by which it js symbolized. j
The Girl's Reserve was formed in
New York City and within a short ,
time has grown to, 60,000 members. !
Each corps of which there are seven I
in Bisbee has various committees of
which the following are the most im-1
portan't: A "scout" or membership I
committee, an "outings aid tourings" I
committee, which is responsible for
hikes, parties, etc. a "service squad," j returned men keep up their govern
which encourages more serious work, j ment insurance.
etc. " , r
A Girl Reserve Council is formed I WINS WRESTLING BOUT .,.
and meets once every so often and
talks over the work, makes plans for
the future and reports on the work
of each particular corps. Each corps
selects a girl as , representative on
this council. "
In telling some of the history and
facts about the Girl Reserve move
ment, Mrs. Hunt said:
. "The Girl Reserves is a national
movement of the Y. W. C. A . for
younger girls. It includes in its mem
bership grade school. Junior High and '
young employed girls, between the
ages of 10 and 18.. !
"The object of ,the "movement is to
give girls through, normal natural ac
tivities the habits', insights and ideals
which will make them responsible and !
capable women. This organization!
was planned and. developed by Miss j
Gertrude Gigin, the National Girls
Work Secretary in November, 1918. In '
less than a year wa have in the Unit-1
ed States 1000 corps and over 35,000 (
Girls Reserve. It . embodies the spirit
of the Camp Fire and Woodcraft;
Guild and in short the best features t
of seven of the Jarger girls' move-,
ments. '
"The insignia is the blue triangle,
thus making them a part of the inter
national movement for girls and women.-
.Then the activities are center
ed around those . four sides of girls;
development which always needs em
phasis and especially now when girls
must be prepared for responsibilities
in the years to come. These four
points are health, knowledge, service
and spiTit. A sound " body, trained
mind, a sense of responsibility togeth
er with a vivtd, understanding spirit
which gives them color and balance to
life are the trtie necessities for a well
rounded; true girl and womanhood.
"The honor system is used and all
the four main factors are emphasized
in obtaining them. The winning of
such an honor means a worth-while
accomplishment. A habit broken, a
friend made or something definintely
attained. When 40 honors are won a
cheveron is given' and this is em
broidered on the Girls' Reserve arm
band in Copenhagen blue. Each
group is called a corps which has. its
own code, color ' and flower. Corps
colors differ and these too are, em
broidered on the arm bands."

Bf RED CROSS
The Pacific Division of the Amer
ican Red Cross announces 1 that ; a
Treasury Department decision ' has
just been made, allowing for very lib
eral terms in the matter of reinstate
ment of lapsed insurance as follows:
1. Lapsed insurance may be rein
stated within 18 months after month
of discharge, on the man's application
and statement that he is in as good
health as at date of discharge, and
upon payment or premium due first
teon after d.arget a"d mlnm
tuvcinig muni u ui x riuaiaifuicui.
2 Aftep the'period of 18 months
cf lapse, the man's insurance may.
still be reinstated during a 'further'
period of 12 months. , " For three
montns or this 12 months period, the
man's statement as to physiial cotu4
dition is still taken as sufficient evi-
dence of his insurability but. after
a formal report from a reputable
physician is required , in verification
of the mans statement that he; is in
as good physical . condition as at
uaLc uioLuaigc.
"he Red Cross wishes to call at-
tention to the fact that during the
time that the insurance is counted.as
lapsed, the man is not insured, so its
members are urged to see that, the re
turned service men ask immediate rer
instatement and "do not neglect , this
because they may ask reinstatement
at any time."

It won't do. You can fuss all vou like
with yjour 191.8 wardrobe but you need sonic
' new clothes. "Made-overs" won't' fit the
1919 program, because:
Tight sleeves were in vogue last Fall,
while "bell" sleeves will be in fashion this
year. As the latter are shorter, you'll need
longer gloves to go with them last year's
oik; button gloves won't do at all.
Skirts are also much smaller this rear
than last year looks as though the mincing
walk had come to stay awhile. If you can't
walk, "slit 'em" that's what many well
dressed women in Newport are doing this
vear.
Feathers are indicated.' Happily your
good feathers can be dyed or renovated and
you can make a saving from which you can
buy one of the new style hats.
You will need some new and pretty
things for litis Fall's home and social wear.
For you know that the Fall of 1917 and 1918
were "lean" years for replenishing ward
robes patriotic women were too busy doing
war work to bother about new clothes.
Weil that's all over and it's patriotic
nowiJ for alert, progressive, prosperous .
Americans to look the part ! If our women .
folks will set a good example the men will
soon follow and the Fall of 1919 will be
bright and gay in every wa'.
Now, don't say that you don't know just
what to buy to look your prettiest this Fall,
because fashion, value and price are beckon
