GREATEST DAY IN HISTORY.
President Wilson Proclaims Signing of
Armistice With Germany.
Washington, Noc. 11. Sign
ing of the armistice with Ger
many was proclaimed today by
President Wilson, who also an
nounced its terms at a joint ses
sion of congress.
The terms herald the end of
the war because they take from
Germany the power to renew it.
Just before he went to the
capitol the president, in a pro
clamation addressed to his fel
low countrymen, said:
"The armistice was signed this
morning.
"Everything for which Amer
ica fought has been accomplish
ed.
"It will now be our fortunate
duty to assist, by example, by
sober, friendly counsel and by
material aid in the establishment
of just democracy throughout
the world."
Stripped of its malicious pow
er, the military autocracy, its
masters driven to exile, stands
before the world's court of jus
tice, having subscribed to terms
of surrender which probably
will be recorded in history as
the most drastic and complete
ever measured out to a defeated
foe.
Reading of the ful text of the
terms discloses measures the
United States and the allied gov
ernments have taken to guaran
tee that Germany's acceptance
shall not be a scrap of paper
and to insure the destruction of
the military which once could
secretly and of its single choice
disturb the peace of the world.
When President Wilson con
cluded his exchange of notes
with Prince Maximilian, then
chancellor, administration offi
cials declared that if his course
did not bring about what they
hoped would be more than an
unconditional surrender it might
bring about a revolution in Ger
many. Pointing today to the Hohen
zollern dynasty, dethroned and
exiled, the people's revolution
sweeping Germany, and the
terms of the armistice, these of
ficials felt their predictions am
ply fulfilled.
Having lifted the yoke of mili
tarism from the people of the
central empires, the allies nov
turn to tasks of humanity and
mercy to bind up their wounds
and feed the hungry, meanwhile
seeking to guide them to a place
in the fame of nations from
which they cau take a part in
assuring that another such days
of bloodshed and horror need
never come again.
Evacuation, reparation and re
stitution are the keynotes of the
armistice.
Here are the principal things
Germany must do, cr, powerless
before the victorious allied ar
mies, will have done for her.
TERMS OF THE ARMISTICE.
The strictly military terms of
the armistice are embraced in
eleven specifications which in
clude the evacuation of all in
vaded territories the withdrawal
of the German troops from the
left bank of the Rhine and the
surrender of all supplies of war.
The terms also provide for the
abandonment by Germany of the
treaties of Bucharest and Brest
Liitovsk.
The naval terms provide for
the surrenderof all submarines,
56 destroyers, six battle cruis
ers, 10 battle ships, eight light
cruisers and other miscellaneous
ships.
All allied vessels in German
hands are to be surrendered, and
Germany is to notify neutrals
that they are free to trade at
once on the seas with the allied
countries.
Among the financial terms in
cluded are restitution for dam
age done by the German armies;
restitution of the cash taken
from the national banks of Bel
gium and return of gold taken
from Russia and Rumania.
The military terms, include
the surrenderof 5,000 guns, half
field and half light artillery;
30,000 machine guns, 0,000 throw
ers and 2,000 airplanes.
The surrender of 5,000 locomo
tivcs, 50,000 wagons, 5,000 mo
tor lorries, the railways of Al
sace Loraine for use by the allies
i and stores of coal and iron also
are included.
The immediate repatriation of
all allied and American prison
ers without reciprocal action by
the allies also is included.
In connection with the avacua
tion of the left bank of the
Rhine, it is provided that the
allies shall hold the crossings of
the river at Coblentz, Cologne
and Mayence, together with
bridge heads in a o0 kilometer
radius.
German troops are to retire at
once from any territory held by
Russia, Rumania and Turkey
before the war.
The right bauk of the Rhine
land, that occupied by the allies,
is to become a neutral zone and
the bank held by the Germans
is to be evacuated in 10 days.
The armistice is for iiO days,
but the president spoke of the
war as "coming to an end."
The allied forces are to have
access to the evacuated territory
either through Dantzig or by
the river Vist-ila. The uncondi
tional capitulation of all German
forces in East Africa within one
month is provided.
Improvement in Cattle Industry.
The allocation of herds of cat
tle to ranches which were able
to take care of additional cattle
and marked improvements have
resulted in some improvement of
conditions in the cattle industry,
according to Kirk Hart. A sur
vey of range conditions revealed
the fact that some of the ranches
could take care of small herds
belonging to cattlemen not so
fortunately situated and these
have been allocated to such
ranches. Several sales of can
ners and other grades have tend
ed to ease conditions.
There has been no improve
ment, however, in general range
conditions in the southern part
of the state, and the special
committee of cattlemen and busi
ness men appointed some time
ago to devise measures of relief
is still engaged with that pro
blem. The range expert dispatched
by the federal government to
make an investigation in this
section, has been unable to come
being ill of influenza in Montana,
and Professor Taylor of the Uni
versity, a member of the com
mittee, is also ill of influenza, so
the committee is marking time
at present.
It has been ascertained that
ranges of northern Sonora can
take care of approximately 100,
000 cattle, and that herds can be
sent over in bond and kept there
under the terms of the bond for
one year. The price would be
$4 per year, which is considered
by cattlemen to be very reason
able, but apparently there is no
way of securing a guarantee
from Mexican authorities of the
protection of herds sent to Mex
ico. Prospector.
KEEP UP WAR WORK.
Washington, D. C., Nov. 6, 1918.
State Council of Defense,
Phoenix, Arizona:
I earnestly beg you not to re
lax your efforts in the slightest
degree on account of the possi
bility of an early armistice.
Even if an armistice should be
concluded this does not mean
that the war is over, and in any
case of emergency will not be
over for a long time. Most of
the work which you have been
called on to perform must go on
undiminished, and I hope every
man and woman in the council
of defense system will stay on
the job. In a few days will
write you as to the outlook for
future work.

UNITED WAR WORK.
Great Agencies Planning for
Work Than Ever.
Mor
Phoenix, Nov. 11 State head
quarters for the United War
Work Campaign had anticipated
that there might be complica
tions in the cam paign work when
any announcement of peace came
and so there was general sur
prise among the workers when
it was found how generally peo
pie appreciated that the demand
upon the seven welfare agencies
banded in the United War Work
Campaign will be much greater
with peace than with war. Al
ready these seven great agen
cies, the Y. M. C. A., the Y. W.
C. A , National Catholic War
Council, Knights of Columbus,
Jewish Welfare Board, War
Camp Community Service, Am
erican Library Asssociatiou and
Salvation Army, are planning
for more active work than ever
in keeping homesick soldiers de
tained overseas when they long
for America, happy until demo
bilization is completed.
Dean Emery, who is attorney
for the United States Shipping
board and. therefore, in a posi
tion to speak authoritatively,
when in Phoenix recently as a
national worker for the United
War Work Campaign, expressed
the belief that it will be at least
two years before all of the Am
erican army in Prance is back
home again. He said that over
two thirds of lhat army had
been taken to Prance in English
ships and that with peace Eng
land would have to use all of
those ships to relieve conditions
in her own kingdom. The many
ships America has built and is
building are cargo carriers, poor
ly fitted to haul troops. Mr.
Emery expressed the belief that
if they started to bring troops
home immediately it would take
very much longer to get them all
back to America than it did, u -der
stress of great need, to get
the in to France and it took over a
year to get them to Prance at that
America will probably have to
act as the watchdog for the Huns
until all peace conditions are
met. France is expected to de
mobilize first, then Eogland, for
those nations with their millions
of dead soldiers need man power
worse than any nation save Ger
many. All these things combine
to make experts with military
knowledge that there is in store
for the American army a long
period of watchful waiting which
is far more wearing upon the
morale of the soldiers than ac
tual fighting.
The seven welfare agencies
banded in the United War Work
Campaign, which is the only
campaign to be made by them in
a year, are planning hundreds
of things to help and keep the
men as contented as may be
when they long for home and
are kept in the service. Exten
sive educational courses are to
be conducted for it has beeu
found that the soldiers take an
intense interest in studies and
other serious things of life. For
relaxation thousands of physical
directors with ample apparatus
will not only help keep the men
fit but keep them amused through
athletics. Theatrical companies
by the score will be used to en
tertain the soldiers in their leis
ure time while movie films will
be used by the thousands of
miles. Then, every three months,
each soldier has eight days of
furlough under army regula
tions. Great bases are main
tained by these agencies where
these meu, denied by reason of
time the chance to go home
when on furlough, may enter
tain themselves. One of these
furlough bases alone has cost
just one of these seven agencies
many millions of dollars so far
for the service must be accom
modated to the slender purse of
the private soldier.
A few moment's thought will
convince anyone that the task
for the seven organizations with
peace is much greater and more
costly than with war for as Dr.
J. R. Mott, director-general of the
campaign, has said, it is a much
bigger task to look after the men
when they have peace leisure
then when but a f ragmentof their
time is devoted to relaxation.
CONSERVATION IN FEEDING
ASKED BY U. S. FOOD
ADMINISTRATION.
PROGRAM FOR MILL FEEDS
DIFFICULT PROBLEMS MUST BE
OVERCOME BY THOROUGH
CO-OPERATION.
The thorough co
operation of Arl-j
iona farmers in thai
line and distribution!
of mill feeds during
I he coming year is
sought in a state-
meut issued by the L'nited Slates Food
Administ ration and released to the
press of Arizona today by the federal
food administrator for thin state.
This statement, which was prepared
by Herbert Hoover, points out some
of the peculiar problems which have
arisen and outlines the mill feed pro
gram for the coming year. The state
ment fu.lows:
Owing to the extension of the
drouih area, the shortening of the
corn nop. the larger animal popula
tion of the country, -and the allied
demands upon us for feeding stuffs
for their own animals, because of
their own shortage In production of
feed grain, it is necessary that we
should exert every effort in the proper
conservation of feeding stuffs during
the next twelve months.
It is necessary that we should ship
a larger proportion of wheat as com
pared with flour durins the next
twelve months than during the laat
twelve months to the allied countries,
because their own shortage of feeding
stuffs is sucji thai if they are to keep
alive tluir dairy herds. they must
have a larger supply of grain wheat.
Already the milk supply of the al
lied countries has teen limited prac
tically to the supply of children and
other vitally necessary national ub.,
and any failure on our part to supply
them with necessary feed stuffs for
their dairy herds means that we
shall cut into the actual safety of the
children amongst the allies.
On the other 'hand both our own
populations and the allies are depend
end upon our production of animal
products, and we do not in any way
wish to stifle this production. What
we must secure is the utmost elimin
ation of waste by the careful feeding
of animals and the use of all the
roughage available.
One .f l he difficult problems is the
distribution of wheat mill feeds, and
this is made more difficult by the fact
that the food administration, in an
endeavor to protect the farmer, is
maintaining an artificially low price
on these feeds. One consequence is
that a great deal of mill feeds are
now going unnecessarily into work
animals or beef production.
Every farmer will recognize that
the wheat mill feeds are vitally neces
sary for the dairy cattle, to some ex
tent for the poultry nnd young pigs.
Owing to the absorption of mill feeds
at local points near the mill consid
erable sections of the dairy industry
are practically without infll feeds and
our dairy production is therefore in
danger.
With view to correcting this so far
as possible the food administration
desires to appeal for the assistance
of the farmers of the country in the
use and distribution of wheat mill
feeds.
In this view we are asking every
buyer of wheat mill feeds outside of
the acute drought areas to sign a
pledge of honor not to use the wheat
mill feeds for any purpose except the
essential use in dairy, young pig. and
poultry production, and not to pur
chase or hold at any one time mora
than CO days supply.
Unless we ran secure this careful
and specialized use of mill feeds our
dairy production in the congested
eastern areas of the l'nited States is
bound to fall and to jeopardize the
food supply of our people in tha' sec
tion. Otherwise it will be necessary
to release the prtC9 restrictions on
mill feeds and allow them to take
their natural course.
With a view to securing this co-operation
from the farmers all over tha.
country in the interests of their in
dustry as a wholf. we are instructing
the mi'ls and all dialers 1n feeds to'
secure from the buyer of wheat milt
feeds the following pledge:
"In order to assist the food admin
istration in the distribution of mill
feeds, I hereby undertake on honor
not to use wheat mill feeds for any
other purpose t:3:t the feeding of
dairy cattle, poultry, young pigs and
young calves, or ihe preparation of a
weekly bran mash for work animals.
I will not feed any more wheat mill:
feeds than is custi-inarlly fed to such
animals and I further agree not to
have at any one time more than a
t.o-day supply of vhat fee-Is on
hand." E. D. MILLER. Editor and Prop.

MAY REOPEN CHURCHES, MOVIES
ArizOQa State Board of Health.
Phoenix, Aiizona, Nov. 11,-19(8.
The question of opening up
churches, theatres, and schools,
in this state is a serious one. It
seems that iniluenza is with us
to stay the greater part of the
winter, and must be reckoned
with. This being tc ne, ic is l
rendered the height of folly to
plan to keep schools, churches,
theatres, etc., closed indelinite
y, but on the other hand, we
certainly do not wish to open
them up and again cause a rapid
spread of the disease.
Prom all the facts that we can
get, it seems that influenza will
keep extending until at least 40
per cent of the population has
had it. This being true, the
problem is to have the disease
spread gradually, so that there
may be enough well people to
care for the sick at any certain
time and at any certain place.
The second part of the prob
lem is that of developing sue
cessful immunity against the
disease. This may be done in
either of two ways, to wit:
Having a mild form of the
disease, or taking the vaccine.
At a meeting'of those physi
cians who had experience with
the epidemic in the northern
part of the state, there was an
unanimous opinion that 90 per
cent of those who had three in
jections of the vaccine, are pro
tected against any serious at
tacks of iniluenza. Believing
these facts, it becomes our duty
to recommend and urge univer
sal use of the vaccine upon the
population of the state.
The State Board of Health
will give permission to the local
health officer to allow the open
ing of schools, churches, thea
tres, etc., in any community
where the following precautions
have been takeu, (providing the
epidemic has sufficiently sub
sided.) 1. There must be a universal,
thorough cleanup of streets, al
leys, yards, and other places
needing same. This must in
clude a general survey against
flies and fiy breeding places.
2. A thorough scrubbing with
hot water and soap or other ap
proved method of cleaning, of
floors, walls, chairs, (backs and
arms especially) and other fur
niture, doors, door jambs, door
knobs, etc., of all buildings,
schools, churches, theatres, and
other places where public meet
ings are held.
3. Posters must be printed
and distributed and attached to
houses where influenza patients
are. (Copy forwarded some
days ago.)
4. Conspicuous posters must
be put prominently in all public
places, calling attention to the
dangers of coughing, sneezing,
spitting, hand shaking and kiss
ing, the use of dishes, glasses,
and other table ware which have
not been thoroughly washed in
hot water since their previous
use.
5. Inspection must be made
by competent persons appointed
by local health officer to ascer
tain if the food and drinking
places are giving proper atten
tion to the washing of their
dishes and glasses, and other
utensils used in the preparation
and serving of food and drink.
6. Receptacles must be placed
upon the streets at such places
and in such numbers as may be
necessary to serve as sputum
basins. If deemed best they
may serve to gather other re
fuse. A prominent sign should
be over each receptacle, calling
attention to the necessity of spit
ting in the receptacle and not
upon the sidewalk or street or
other inappropriate place.
7. An effort must be made to
induce everybody to take the in
fluenza vaccine. That which we
have developed here in Phoenix,
seems to be the best. This effort
must be honest, serious, and
systematic. Teams should be
developed for the purpose of a
systematic canvass of the town
and other districts affected, urg
ing everybody to take at least
three injections of the vaccine.
8. When satisfactory evidence
has been presented to the State
Board of Health, that all seven
things have been done in the
spirit in which they should be,
and the number of cases of in
iluenza has sufficiently decreas
ed, permission may be obtained
for opening up churches, schools,
theaters, etc.

My Dear Colonel Carnahan:
Permit me, on my own behalf
and that of the residents of No
gales, to express to you the pro
found gratitude which we all
feel for your unfailing kindness
in providing for Nogales the
greater and more interesting
part of the most historic cele

splendid organization of musi
cians. You also provided a mil
itary parade that will go down
in the annals of Nogales as the
most magnificent ever held here.
In every respect you were most
responsive to our repeated re
quests for aid and without you
and the gallant officers and men
of your command the transcen
dent event we were all celebrat
ing would not adequately have
been observed.
Please accept for yourself and
your command my sincerest
thanks and congratulations.
Very sincerely yours,

The Woman's Tonic
You can rely on Cardui.
Surely it will do for you
what it has done for so
many thousands of other
women! It should help.
"I was taken sick,
seemed to be . . . ,'
writes Mrs. Mary E. Veste,
of Madison Heights, Va.
"I got down so weak,
could hardly walk . . .
just staggered around.
... I read of Cardui,
and after taking one bot
tle, or before taking quite
all, I felt much better. I
took 3 or 4 bottles at
that time, and was able to
do my work. I take it in
the spring when run
down. I had no appetite,
and I commenced eating.
It is the best tonic I ever
saw." Try Cardui.
