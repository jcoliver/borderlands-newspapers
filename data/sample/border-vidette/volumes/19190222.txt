The Spirit of Friendship.
This store looks upon its patrons not
merely as customers but as friends.
People purchase here because they
have friendly feeling for this store.
The cause which develops this friendly
feeling:, may differ, in fact, they are
sure to differ. One's friendship for
the store is the result of finding good
values; another's is the result of effi
cient service and courteous treatment,
and so on.
Naturally this friendshiply feeling on
the part of our patrons is reciprocated
on our part. And this spirit of mutual
friendship is an impetus for greater
service and an incentive to ever-increasing
endeavor to make this store
a place where every visitor will feel
perfectly at home.

Six feet of snow in the White
mountains and a serious short
age of fuel at Ft. Apache were
reported to the United States
weather bureau at Phoenix re
cently, in a communication from
George J. Henry, observer.
A splendid rain visited the
lowlands Tuesday night, while
the mountains were covered with
a mantle of snow. Reports from
outlying districts indicate the
storm was quite general, which
is encouraging news for stock
man and farmer, as well as the
community in general, Patago
nian.
The Navajo' County Fair asso
ciation of Snowflake recently
purchased one thousand acres
just northwest of the town,
where the future fairs will be
held. Preparations are already
being made to make the second
annual fair better than the in
itial one held in October of last
year.
Efforts to oust Thomas Edwin
Farish and to abolish the office
of state historian have failed.
The bill introduced by Senator
Whiting to accomplish this has
been indefinitely postponed in
the senate, while in the house
another bill on the subject has
been introduced by Peterson to
continue the office.
In connection with the visit of
the Utah delegation to discuss
the purchase from Arizona of
land north of the Grand canyon,
it is interesting to recall that a
considerable portion of the north
ern part of Mohave county was
withdrawn by the Government
in the year 1910, on the recom
mendation of the U. S. Geolo
gical Survey, as a possible oil
bearing area.
Former county attorney C. B.
Wilson, of Coconino county and
county attorney Kirk T. Moore,
of Pima county, arc in Phoenix
working out details of the court
action they may bring jointly
against either Yavapai county
or state auditor Jesse Boyce for
a settlement of the muddle at
tending the congressional grant
of 1,000,000 acres to Arizona for
the payment of railroad debts
that had been fastened upon the
territory by congressional ac
tion. At the next University assem
bly at the University, which will
be on March 2, at 3 o'clock in
the Auditorium, there will be a
Memorial Service for the mem
bers of the iaculty and student
body who have given their lies
for their country, either in mili
tary service or other forms of
war work. These Sunday as
semblies are open to visitors,
and are looked forward to by
many residents in the neighbor
hod as well as by the University
community.
Had congress attended to the
business of the country, entrust
ed to its care, instead of wasting
days, weeks and months criticis
ing the president and his cabinet
officials, who are doing their
duty, the country would be in
better condition. Finhead pol
iticians, not all republicans we
are sorry to say, have gabbed,
jangled, resoluted and run
around in a circle to attract at
tention. In the mean time our
president has gone the even
tenor of his way and despite the
sorry spectacle of congress, he
has accomplished much for hu
m anity.
Con Cronin, state librarian,
has prepared for submission to
the legislature a bill to appro
priate $10,000 to build approa
ches to Lee's ferry, Coconino
county, which is the only cross
ing for many miles either way of
the Colorado river in the Grand
canyon. It developed at the
conference of the Utah delega
tion with the Arizona officials,
that there were three possible
crossing places over the great
chasm of the canyon. One is at
Lee's ferry, where the Utah men
estimated to build a bridge and
the seconcPis at the mouth of
the Grand wash. A bill already
is pending before the legislature
for an initial appropriation of
s7 ,(!()() for work at this point.
HONOR OUR HEROES.
A bill has been introduced in
the State legislature to appro
priate a certain sum of money
foe the erection of a monument
in honor of Lieutenant Frank
Luke, Jr., of Phoenix, who died
in the service of his country
and who was one of the most
celebrated fliers of the Ameri
can army.
While every honor is due the
name of Arizona's best known
hero of the war, we do not think
that jt is either fair or courteous
to the other Arizona men, who
gave up their lives during the
emergency, to erect a monu
ment, at State expense, to any
one in particular.
Frank Luke, Jr., through his
exploits, his sensational and
heroic death, stood out above all
other Arizona soldiers and sail
ors. His was a service that en
abled him to make the most of
his opportunity. He shed a
lustre on the name of his native
State that few men can equal.
But even that does not warrant
the appropriation of money with
which to build a monument to
himf to the exclusion of all
others.
Arizona's contribution to the
war amounted to more than 15,
000 men. Each and every one
did his part. He was sent
whever his services were most
needed and that more of the
men from this commonwealth
did not add glory to their names
is not their fault. Circumstance
and fortune good or evil had
much to do with it. Arizona,
however, did contribute a num
ber of soldiers and sailors who
will never return to the arid des .
erts and blooming valleys of the
rState. They went and will
never return. Their contribu
tion was fully as great as that
of -Frank Luke, Jr. They died
that their country might live.
All honor to the men who
served Arizona and America well
and who paid the supreme price
for that dut.y ! Let Arizona honor
them! But let the State honor
all of them and not select one
or more than one to the exclu
sion of the others.
Instead of a memorial hall,
proposed by Governor Campbell
and which, should it be erected,
would soon be used as an over
flow office for the capitol, and
instead of a monument for Frank
Luke, let the State legislature
appropriate a good sum to erect
a monument to all of the soldiers
of Arizona who died in the ser
vice of their country.
Put, at the top of such a mon
ument, the statute of a "dough
boy" the emblem of the Ari
zona fighting prowess and on
the bottom of the shaft incribe
the names of all the men who
died that Arizona might be a
better and a safer place in which
to live. Such a monument erect
ed and placed on the capitol
grounds in Phoenix, would be
an appropriate and lasting testi
monial to the offering of this
State that Democracy might not
perish. Arizona Star.
ARIZONA STATE FAIR NOV. 3-8.
The 1919 session of the Ari
zona state fair, which was an
nounced this morning, will be
gin on Monday, November U.and
continue throughout the entire
week, is to be the biggest and
most attractive state wide expo
sition which the'fair commission
has ever undertaken and, to
ward that end, plans are being
made to create a more general
interest in the big amusement
and educational event in all
parts of the state, says the Ari
zona Gazette of February 12.
In other words it will be the
intention of the managers to put
on such a varied and interesting
program of sports, speed events,
displays and amusements of all
sorts that the enterprise will no
longer be regarded as a semi
local affair, but will be one de
signed to attract the attention
of practically every person in
the state of Arizona and the ad
jacent commonwealths.
As a concrete example of the
intention of the fair managers
to make this the biggest boost
show that has ever been staged
in the southwest it has been de
cided to put on one of the most
comprehensive speed programs
ever staged in western America,
the events to include both auto
racing and harness and running
races. In order that this part
of the big entertainment can be
carried out on a somewhat larger
scale than has prevailed during
years past the racing events will
be in charge of a commission
composed of five interested mem
bers selected from various parts
of the state, in charge of T. E.
Pollock of Flagstaff, who has
been selected as chairman of
this commission. The four re
maining are to be selected in the
near future, and upon the com
pletion of the organization, the
details of the racing program
will be worked out. Heretofore
the speed events have been in
charge of one man-, who has
been designated as the superin
tendent of speed, but it was felt
that better results could be ob
tained if the department was en
larged so as to take in practi
cally all parts of the state.
One of the features which has
already been tentatively decided
upon in connection with this
program will be a road'i'ace open
to all auto drivers who care to
participate, a substantial purse
to be hung up, and conditions
made such that a revival of this
popular pastime of years gone
by will be apparent. The route
is yet to be selected, but what
ever city is designated as the
terminating point, the driver can
rest assured that the route will
be placed over some good strip
of road which will enable the
contestants to make, a good run
ning record.
Owing to the fact that the fair
of 1918 had to be called off be
cause of the prevalence of the
influenza last fall, it is believed
that a larger sum of money will
be in the hands of the fair pro
moters this year and that a cor
responding better progrom of
sports and displays can be pro
vided. The fair commission this year
consists of C. K. Pishon, chair
man; H. A. Clark of Douglas,
member; J. B. Ryland of Tuc
son, treasurer, and Charles Price
of Mesa, secretary.
MUST GO STRAIGHT THROUGH
(By Speaker Champ Clark of
Missourt.)
"It goes without saying that
there must and will be another
big bond issue. Having put our
hands to the plow we must not
look back. We cannot afford to.
Because while the world war is
really over, it is not tecnically
ended until President Wilson is
sues a proclamation to that ef
fect. We still have a huge army
overseas and while it should be
brought home as soon as ships
can bring our soldiers back, un
til they get back, they must be
fed and clothed and otherwise
cared for.. It would be an ever
lasting shame not to do that.
So people should subscribe for
the impending loan and pur
chase War Savings Stamps as
readily and liberally as they
subscribed for past loans. It's
for the support of our soldiers
and nothing is too good for
them."

W.-.Y AMERICAN TROOPS ARE AT
ARCHANGEL.
Just now nagging republicans
in the senate and through the
press are making much ado over
the fact that allied troops and
a few .thousand American sol
diers are at Archangel in north
ern Russia where they are be
sieged by bolsheviki.
Before Russia dropped out of
the war, hundreds of millions in
supplies, war munitions and
clothing were sent to Vladiostok
in eastern Siberia and to Ar
changel, in effort to supply Rus
sia so she could keep in the
fighting game.
For over two years ships rush
ed to those ports and unloaded.
Then came the crash and Russia
was out. German troops tried
to reach these supplies. Troops
were dispatched for protection
but the U boats were so busy
ships could not be spared to haul
the stuff away.
The bolsheviki now want these
supplies and are fighting like
brigands to secure them.
When warm- weather returns
and ocean ships can safely na
vigate the Arctic ocean, it is
probable these deposits will be
brought away. Then the guard
troops will withdraw.
Now this is the plain truth.
Could it have been foreseen that
Russia would collapse these sup
plies would not have been ship
ped but when it was too late,
the facts became know and Am
erica . entered the war to help
stem the tide. Fair minded
Americans know this and the
nagging tactics for political pur
poses, will react on the repub
lican politicians who love party
more than country. Messenger.
600,000 ACRES FOR SOLDIERS.
Nearly half a million acres of
land in Arizona for returned
army and navy men and others
who are looking for well irrigat
ed, first class farms, is the key
note of an immense co oidinated
project which is being worked
out under the direction of An
drew Kimball, Arizona repre
sentative of the agricultural de
partment of the federal railroad
administration.
Mr. Kimball said that for some
time past he had been working
to bring together and harmonize
the interests of the different irri
gation projects of the state, so
that when the time came for ac
tion, as, he said, it had come
now, with Secretary Lane 3
$100,000,000 soldiers' settlement
proposition before the country.
rthe united power of all would be
behind the movement to force
recognition of Arizona's claims
at Washington.
The Arizona Cattle Growers'
association adopted a resolution
which had been drafted by Mr.
Kimball and Geo. H, Maxwell,
executive director of the Nation
al Reclamation association. This
resolution asks congress to ap
point the commission named by
the Newlands river regulation
amendment to conserve waters
the crest of the watershed. It
continues.
"This association urges the
construction without delay of the
Upper Gila, San Carlos, Camp
Verde, Horseshoe, Charleston,
Sentinel and Parker reservoirs
and all other practical irrigation
projects and reservoirs for flood
water storage in Arizona."
Unanimous endorsement of the
plans for the reclamation of
large areas in the state for set
tlement by returned soldiers,
sailors and war workers was
voiced by the cattlemen.
The faculty of the University
has been strengthened by the
appointment of Miss Helen S.
Nicholson as instructor in the

graduate of Vassar, and took
her Master's Degree at the Un

She is an experienced teacher of
Spanish, having lived in Porto

Nogales Boosters on West Coast
Having Time of Their Lives.
People of Hermosillo, Sonora's
capital, and Gua.ytnas, on the
bay, have maintained their in
ternational reputation us prince
of entertainers. The Nogales
Boosters who have just visited
those towns on their way to the
West Coast of Mexico, will all
testify to that fact.
The Chamber of Commerce
trade excursionist, two Pullman
carloads, with diner and baggage
cars, got away from the border
soon after noon, last Wednesday,
in their special train, which was
in charge of Colonel Ben Ashby,
the vetern passenger conductor.
This is the first time many ot
the excursionists have visited
the wonderful country to the
south of us, and that all are
having a great time goes with
out saying. Bracey Curtis, Dr.
Guste.tter, Bill Haley, Joaquin
Legana, Alan Gillespie, Joe
Wise, Harry Karns, Ferd. Van
Mourick, and others of that no
ble bunch of boosters, will see to
it that there are no dull moments
on the long trip, and if any fail
to have a good time well, it
served them right. It was there
for them.
In his speech at Hermosillo,
in response to Governor Calles'
address of welcome to the No
gales boosters, Hon. Frank J.
Barry, of this city, said:
"It is not necessary for us to
tell you how heartily we appre
ciate the generous welcome you
have given us. For many of us
this is the first visit to your
splendid country. All our lives
we had heard and read wonder
ful tales of Mexico and there
had developed in our imagina
tion visions of romance and
glory and dazzling splendor.
Now that we have seen your
country we are amazed at its
peerless beauty, its vast stores
of developed and undeveloped
wealth; but most of all our
hearts have been captured by
the charm and hospitality of its
people. We find historic roman
tic Mexico fully equal to the
ideals we cherished and up to
our expectations in glory and
beauty and richness; and now
we all agree that this has been
the most delightful and satis
fying journey of our lives.
"We come tc visit you not as
strangers but as neighbors. An
imaginary line separates the ter
ritory which is designated in
the geographies as your country
from the land which is called
America; but there is no bound
ary line, not even an imaginary
one, between your ideals and
ours, your aspirations and ours,
your destiny and ours. We are
neighbors, and we are neighbors
cherishing the same principles.
You believe as we believe that
all men are created equal. You
have repudiated the theories of
monarchic government just as
we have, and both of us believe
in the inalienable rights of life,
liberty and the pursuit of hap
piness. We both believe, in the
language of a great American,
Abraham Lincoln, in govern
ment of the people, by the peo
pie, and for the people.'
"And so being thus neighbors
in geographical location and be
lieving as we do in the same
fundamental political principles,
why can we not also be neigh
bors in feeling and in interest?
We visitors from America want
to be your neighbors in every
sense. We should have no mis
understandings, no differences.
Are we not neighbors on this
great American continent, a
hemisphere dedicated by fate to
Liberty and human justice?
And, neighbors, Liberty knows
no geography. It is from hea
ven. No monarch, no nation, no
power has the right to fix its
limits. It is your most cherish
ed ideal as it is ours. You have
spilt your blood in its cause as
have we, and neither you or we
shall ever deny to Liberty the
home made for her by blood and
sacrifice on this continent.
'"This continent, your land
and our land, is the land of the
future. With its resources and
its peoples fate has marked it as
the home of the greatest civili
zation the world has ever known,
where individual rights and hu
man justice are to be sacredly
guarded. The dawu of this
great civilization is at hand. In
the twilight of the new era we
see the two sisters, America and
Mexico, united by the bonds of
mutual interest, inter dependent
yet independent; standing upon
the common ground of justice
and law; and holding aloft the
shining shield of Liberty. And
as we watch the great sun of
the new civilization break over
the hill tops of misunderstand
ings and mistakes, the whole
continent reflects its kindly rays
of brotherhood, cordiality, lol
erance and love.
"My friends, Mexican and
Americans, this is no dream.
This is no phantom vision.
Every man of us, if he loves his
own country and wishes its fut
ure to be great, has the duty to
see it becomes a reality. We
have made the right start. We
are not here as strangers but as
neighbors. Lot us ba friends.
Let us be more. Our interests
are common. Destiny points her
iin'ger in the same direction for
us both. Let us be brothers.
Let us love each other."

OTTO HEROLD LOSES PAJAMAS
The only calamity that has
happened on the otherwise per
fect trip of the Nogales Cham
ber of Commerce trade excursion
to the West Coast of Mexico,
happened to Otto Herold, vice
president of the First National
Bank. Mr. Herold, Wednesday
night, while seated on the side
of his bp.rth, deftly engaged in
getting ready to retire, opened
his suitcase and took out a pair
of pink pajamas, and as he did
so, Bill Haley, who had been in
the baggage car to get a drink
of water, returned to the sleep
er, and as he opened the door to
the sleeping car, a gust of wind
whipped Mr. Herold's new paja
mas from off the berth, carried
them the full length of the sleep
ing car, and then blew them
through a ventilator. Herald.

ranged, at the request of the

tion, for an increased acreage
during the coming season.
In order to make possible in
creased acreage of sugar beets,

Manufacturers' Association more
labor is necessary and that Mex

adaptable to the work.

A WARNING TO TAX-DODGERS.
Commissioner Daniel C. Roper
has issued the following state
ment as t the Internal Revenue
Bureau's attitude toward those
who attempt to evade taxation:
"Any person who deliberately
conceal tas. liability, or who
falsities a return in order to re
duce or evade any Internal Rev
enue t:-.x, or who deliberately
p.bet- such concealment or fraud
finds arrayed against him the
entire strength of this Bureau,
pressing for the full civil and
criminal pentalties. That is the
attitude to vard the tax evader,
expressed in one sentence. Whe
ther
lie
is a moonshiner, a
stealthv trafficker in habit form
ing drugs, a juggler of income
figures, a delinquent in making
the sworn return the law re
quires, cr a Revenue violator of
any k'tid, the Bureau is charged
wi'h the duty of hunting him
out and exacting the full punish
ment provided in the law.
'Toward tiie taxpayer who
means to comply with the Inter
nal Revenue laws, fully and
honestly, the Bureau extends a
helping hand. Co operation with
the taxpayer is our watchword
and objective. One of the most
difficult of the many problems
in tax collecting is to classify
those who fail to fulfill the obli
gations imposed by law.
"There are three distinct
classes of delinquency with
which we have to deal. First,
the taxpayer who had reasona
ble cause brought about by ex
ceptional conditions beyond his
control; secondly, the man who
did not look up or did not realize
his obligations; and thirdly, the
person who wilfully evaded com
pliance with the law.
"As for the man who shows a
reasonable cause within certain
lines established by the Bureau,
no penalties are asserted. All
other delinquents are more care-
fully investigated before prose
cution is bsguo. Many of these
offenses are caused by ignorance
and negligence. Failure to mak.e
the reports required by law may
iu some cases warrant severe
penalties, as where the delin
quent continues his delinquency
after being warned of the penal
ty for failure to make return.
"But there is no relief for the
man who wilfully evade, wilfully
neglects or wilfully falsifies. He
is classed with other lawbreak
ers in the eyes of the Bureau
and is vigorously prosecuted in
the courts.
"There is no other course open
to the Bureau, in meeting fairly
and squarely the 'demand of the
willing taxpayer. The Bureau
is fulfilling its part of this con
tract with the people this con
tract that means so much in the
practical, effective and just ad
ministration of the Internal Re
venue laws."
TRES DE MAYO MINE.
Doctor O. B. Bachman, a min
ing operator of experience, who
in 1916 took over the Tres de
Mayo mines, situated out in the
Patagonia mountains, on the
west side of the range, about
opposite the Mowry, but was
obliged to abandon work at the
beginning of the war, on ac
count of the general uncertainty
prevailing, has returned to San
ta Cruz county, and will resume
operations in the Tres de Mayo.
Doctor Bachman is accompa
nied by Mr. H. C. Wikoff, from
Pasadena, California, who is in
terested in the project, and the
two are associated with another
Pasadena gentleman of means.
Mr. F. J. Merritt, who has taken
an interest as a legitimate in
vestment. Work will be resum
ed shortly, and it will be pushed
with vigor, as the parties have
every faith in the property and
ample means for its develop
ment. The Tres do Mayo (Third of
May) is a lead silver proposition;
and in the workings there are
exposed large bodies of high
grade rock that will yield richly
in those metals.
Upon the cropping on a bit of
virgin ground, at the north end
of one of the claims Mr. Wikoff
broke off with his bootheel rock
that assayed $1,200 in lead and
silver per ton. Oasis.

exceeding $5,000 dollars, are
now being sent out rrom the in
ternal revenue collector' office.

than March 15, 1919. The forms
for corporations and individual
incomes in excess of $3,000 will
be mailed out as soon as they
are received from the depart
meat. FEBRUARY 22, 1919.
MINES AND MINERS.
(Santa Cruz Patagonian.)
The Consolidated Copper Co.
is cross-cutting for the ore body.
The Mowry mines are operat
ing steadily with an increased
force.
The Flux mine is being placed
in conditon for a large tonnage
of mill dirt.
The Three R property is un
der examination by one of the
largest mining companies in the
state.
The Castle Butte property has
been taken under optiou. When
the property is developed it
should make one of the large
mines of the district.
Buck Reid, secretary of the
Flux company, and Jack Me
Gregor, who is interested" in
the same company, were in town
Tuesday on their way to Bisbee.
Hiram Whitcomb, general
manager of the World's Fair
mines, was a visitor in Nogales
last week and gave favorable re
ports of operations at his prop
erty. W. D. Gray, who is doing de
velopment work oi the Colle
cello mine adjoining the Three
R. property, was in Patagonia
Tuesday and reports favorable
progress.
Ore is now being hauled to
town from the Hosey property.
This is an excellent grade of
copper silver ore and it is re
ported that the operators have
a good tonnage of it.
Colonel R. R. Richardson is
displaying at hi3 offiae, samples
of high grade copper ore re
cently uncovered on the 700
foot level of the Three R mine.
The ore assays 75 per cent.
A number of mining men have
been looking over properties in
the district during the pg.st
week, including examination of
properties by parties from Je
rome, Arizona, and New York,
J. F. Johnson, who is operat
ing a silver property on Bear
creek, in the Huachucas, was in
Patagonia Tuesday. Mr. John
son states the prospects of de
veloping a producing mine, are
encouraging.
William J. Mitcheli, superin
tendent of the El Paso mine at
Mowry, has recently installed a
new air compressor on the prop
erty. Development work is pro
ceediag satisfactorily and it is
reported good ore is being un
covered. The Fierce-Gardner property
is looking bigger than ever. The
vein is eight feet wide in the
bottom of the shaft and is widen
ing as work progresses. This
property has shipped two cars
this week and has a third about
ready to be loaded.
Mr. Schreiver and G. F.
Stuckart, vice president of the
Anthracite Trust Company of
Scranton, Pa., who are inter
ested in the Southern Arizona
Mining and Smelting Company,
were in this district on business
last week. They have returned
to their home in the East.
The World's Fair mine is de
veloping large tonnages of fine
ore. The company's mine mill
has been closed down on account
of the big Fairbanks Morse en
gine breaking a cylinder head.
As soon as the power plant is in
operating condition this prop
erty will be turning out a good
tonnage of excellent grade con
centrates. Arizona is the premier copper
mining state. It produces an
nually one third of the copper
output of the United States, be
ing about one sixth of the en
tire world output. The value of
the state's copper production for
the year 1918 was over 200,000,
000, while the annual output of
gold, silver, lead aud zinc aggre
gated Si 3,000,000.

Company, which property is lo
cated near Harshaw, was trans
acting business in Patagonia

sociates are heavily interested
in the Trench holdings at present.

About
Gone
Many thousands of
women suffering from
womanly trouble, have
been benefited by the use
of Cardui, the woman's
tonic, according to letters
we receive, similar to thin
one from Mrs. Z. V. Spell,
of Hayne. N. C. "I could
not stand on my feet, and
just suffered terribly,'"
she says. "As my suf
fering was so great, and
he had tried other reme
dies, Dr. had us
get Cardui. . . I beRwi
improving, and it cured
me. I know, and ray
doctor knows, what Car
dui did for me, for my
nerves and hearth were
about gone."
TAKE
The Woman's Tosic
She writes iurther: " I
am in splendid health . . .
can do my vork. I feci I.
owe. it to Cardui, for I was
in dreadful condition."
If yea are nervous, run
down and weak, cr suffer
from headache, backache,
etc., every month, try
Cardui. Thousands of
women praise this medi
cine for the good it has
done them, and many
physicians who have used
Cardui successfully with
their women patients, for
years, endorse this medi
cine. Think what it means
to be in splendid health,
like Mrs. Spe'.l. Give
Cardui a trial.
