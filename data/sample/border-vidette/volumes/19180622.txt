A PROCLAMATION.
"This war is one of nations
not of armies and all of our 100,-
000,000 people must be econo
mically and industrially adjust
ed to war conditions if this na
tion is to play its full part in the
conflict. The problem before us
is not primarily a financial prob
lem but lather a problem of in
creased productiou of war essen
tials and the saving of the ma
terials and the labor necessary
for the support and equipment
of our army and navy.
"Thoughtless expenditure of
money for non essentials uses
up the labor of men, the pro
ducts of the factories and over
burdens transportation, all of
which must be used to the ut
most and at their best for war
purposes.
"The great results which we
seek can be obtained only by the
participation of every member
of the nation, young and old, in
a national concerted thrift move
ment. I, therefore, urge that
our people every where pledge
themselves as suggested by the
secretary of the treasury to the
practice of thrift to serve the
government to their utmost in
increasing production in all fields
necessary to the winning of the
war to conserve food and fuel
and useful materials of every
kind to devote their labor only
to the most necessary tasks and
to buy only those things which
are essential to individual health
and efficiency and that the peo
ple as evidence of their loyalty
invest all that they can save in
liberty Bonds and War Savings
Stamps.
"The securities issued by the
treasury department are so many
of them within the reach of
everyone that the door of oppor
tunity in this matter is wide
open to all of us. The practice
of thrift in peace times is a vir
tue and brings great benefit to
the individual at all times. With
the desperate need of the civil
ized world today for materials
and labor with which to end the
war, the practice of individual
thrift is a patriotic duty and a
necessity.
"I appeal to all who now own
either Liberty Bonds or War
Savings Stamps to continue to
practice economy and thrift and
to appeal to all who do not own
government securities to do like
wise and purchase them to the
extent of their means. The man
who buys government securities
transfers the purchasing power
of his money to the United
States government until after
this war and to that same degree
does not buy in competition with
the government.
"I earnestly appeal to every
man, woman and child to pledge
themselves on or before the
twenty eighth of June to save
constantly and buy as regularly
as possible, the securities of the
government and to do this, as
far as possible, through mem
bership in war savings societies.
The twenty -eighth of June ends
this special period of enlistment
in the great volunteer army of
production and saving here at
home. May there be none en
listed on that day.

PATAGONIA DISTRICT SHOWS
GREAT ACTIVITY.
The Patagonia district is re
turning to its own. Almost all
of the old mines are working,
even the old Mowry being open
ed up, and miners are working"
where a year ago there was
nothing but jack rabbits and de
serted shafts.
The Three R mine is working
fifty men and developing new
copper silver ore.
The Andes mine, nearby, own
ed by R. R. Richardson, is com
pleting a tramway from Flux
Canyon to the mine. Incident
ally, a tunnel is being driven
1000 feet through the mountain,
cutting the ore all the waj The
tunnel is now in 245 feet. The
ore will be taken through the
tunnel.
The World's Fair is getting in
shape and is building a road to
give direct communication from,
the mine to the Flux Canyon, a
cut off of about six miles which
will save twelve miles of haul.
The new owners of the old
Flux are getting out a good
grade of silver-lead and a new
mill is being installed.
The owners of the Mowry are
getting it in shape to open up
the low grade ore body in the
lower levels.
In the Harshaw county, R. R.
Richardson is shipping from the
old Hardshell silver lead mine.
The old Trench has about forty
miners at work in two shifts, A.
W. Clark being behind Hoy in
the operation.
In the Duquesne country the
Westing house interests are work
ing six trucks and eleven teams
of six horses each getting out the
ore which is hauled to Mexico
and sent to Naco. There are
about 235 men working there.
The ore is copper-gold and some
zinc. About 150 tons a day are
being shipped from the dozen
claims the Westinghouse inter
ests holds, including the Du
quesne mine.
Three miles from there the
Santo Nino leasers are getting
some rich silver ore. Citizen.
U. S. AIRMEN VISIT TUCSON.
Four hundred and eighty Am

the medical corps, numbering
thirty five. When they came
and whither they are going is

The aviators enjoyed a plunge
in the Y. M. C. A. pool and a
lounging period in the deep

FROM THE FRONT.
Joe Halstead Is a Very Busy Man
Somewhere in France.
The following is from an in
teresting letter written by J. R.
Halstead, Sergeant of the 20th
Eagineers, in Prance, to his
mother, Mrs. J. D. Halstead, of
Phoenix:
Somewhere in Prance, May
12th, 1918.
M.v dearest Mother:
Of all the letters that I have
written home this is the one that
I desire most of all to have you
receive, as this is "Mothers'
Day," and I am thinking of
my dear mother and home. You
are with me in my thoughts
mother and I would give most
anything to see you. Being so
far away and everything so un
certain, makes one realize just
how dear a mother is. Even
tho' I can't be with you this day
but am far away, you are with
me in my thoughts.
I have not written to anyone
for about lifteen days, as I have
been gone from the office all
that time. You see I am the
supply Sergeant of a very large
district, and it is different here
than in the States, as there I
was only Sergeant of the 3rd
Ba. 20th Engineers, but here I
am the supply Sergeant of all
the troops in our district.
All of Prance is laid off in
districts and one Headquarters
control each district. Our dis
trict is quite a large one and we
have troops coming into the dis
trict all the time. We will soon
have them going out, but sup
pose they will keep coming in
all the time. There are troops
of all kinds in the district but
we have to look after them just
the same. I made a complete
round of all the troops in the
district this trip and then had
to go away back to the coast
after some auto parts. You see
freight shipments are so very
slow here that we go by auto
mobile for anything we need in
a hurry.
Tne troops are all working
day and night so if any thing
breaks down it is up to me to
get a new part and if we don't
happen to hai'e it in stock in the
supply office I have to go after it.
1 have been to all the big
Quartermaster, Engineer, Or
dinance and Signal Corps ware
houses in Prance and am posted
on the condition of their stocks
so I most always know just
where to go after what I want.
Many times I will be called by
the night orderly and have him
hand me a message from some
outfit saying that they need
some small part of some ma
chine or if from our troops that
are sawing, saying that their
saw mill has broke down and
they need such and such parts
and I have to get up, call the
driver, leave a note with the
orderly to give to the Major say
ing where I am going, and away
I go. I sometimes make two
hundred miles before the office
knows that I have gone as it
will be in the night. We have
saw mills blown up, on partly
blown up by shell tire and a
great many times I have to work
two or three days, day and night
getting the necessary parts to
get them started off again.
It may seem funny to you all
to think that we would be saw
ing lumber close enough tc the
front to have mills destroyed by
shell fire, but if you knew what
a little amount of timber there
is in France you would readily
understand it. If the timber is
left there it is soon completely
destroyed by the heavy bom
bardments so after it we go. A
mill will be blown up and within ;
a few hours another one will be
setting alongside where the
other one was going ahead the !
same as if nothing happened.
We use portable mills of 10 M
foot capacity and they can be
quickly moved to place or to
new location. Use all circular
saws and none of them over 60
inches as the timber is all small
and there is no need of larger.
We saw trees here into timber,
trench props and RR ties that
would only make firewood in the
states, but that is all they have
over here so we have to use it.
I will have to close mother as
I am leaving again in a very
few minutes. It is now 5:10 a.
m. I got up early so I could
Mr. Hearst's Critical Analysis of
Mr. Roosevelt and His Political Purposes
Editor Los Angeles "Examiner"
MOUNT CLEMENS, Mich., May 13. Mr. Roosevelt,
though notably less able and less respectable, is em
phatically the Asquith of American politics. He is
out of power and he is greedily eager to get back into
power, and he does not scruple at any methods, no matter
how unfair to the Administration or how harmful to the
country, in order to accomplish his purely selfish political
purposes.
The attack which Mr. Roosevelt now makes upon the
Administration is just as baseless as the attack which As
quith made upon Lloyd George, and it will prove to be just
as futile in its effect upon the Administration and just as
ftal in its effect upon Mr. Roosevelt.
The immediate causes of Mr. Roosevelt's present out
burst are two in number.
The first cause is the fact that the magazine which
hires Mr. Roosevelt at $1 per word to make vicious
attacks upon the Government of the United States during
war time was excluded from the mails in one issue for a
wholly false and absolutely unjustified attack upon the Pres
ident of the United States and the diplomacy of the United
States, calculated to bring our country and our people into
contempt and consequently to injure our cause.
Mr. Roosevelt did not write this particular article, but
it is conceivable that any menace to the existence of a mag
azine which pays so liberally for political slander arouses a
natural concern on the part of Mr. Roosevelt for his own
profitable, if not patriotic, contract.
The second cause of Mr. Roosevelt's immediate agita
tion is the fact that the small and lonely New York news
paper which is supporting Mr. Roosevelt's perpetual aspira
tions for the Presidency was recently rebuked as a public
enemy by the representatives of the United States Govern
ment for printing as news certain articles which had no
foundation in fact, and which discredited the officers of the
United States Army and held them up to ridicule and con
tumely, without the slightest basis of truth or justice in the
allegations.
In any other country in the world, in critical war times,
traitorous publications like Mr. Roosevelt's magazine and
Mr. Roosevelt's newspaper, whose only objects in printing
falsehood were petty political spite against the President
and partisan surport of the aspirations of a rival candi
date, would have been wholly suppressed as treasonable.
Our Government, however, is lenient with such offend
ing publications and with Mr. Roosevelt himself because the
Administration properly believes that in a republic the right
cf free speech and free publication should be preserved,
even though there be occasional disloyal abuses of this right,
as in the case of Mr. Roosevelt and the magazine which
hires him and the newspaper which politically supports him.
That the United States Government was entirely right
in its denunciation of Mr. Roosevelt's New York newspaper
was conclusively proven in the suit which arose out of the
resignation from that newspaper of its editor, Mr. Frank H.
Simonds, well known throughout this country for his patri
otic articles on the war.
falsehood, and intended for the information and assistance
of the Administration and not for its discomfiture and de
struction. For years the Hearst publications have advocated pre
paredness and have Leon denounced as jingoes by the short
sighted for doing so.
For years these publications have advocated the ex
tension of West Point and Annapolis and the establishmenl
of national universities throughout the country to provid
trained officers for the army and navy in time of need.
For years these publications have advocated the cor.
struction of the greatest navy in the world and creatioi
of a nationally owned merchant marine to act as an auxil
iary navy in time of war.
Every since tho beginning of the European war tht
Hearst publications have advocated universal service, and 1
personally went to Washington and wrote in the Washing
ton Post a signed article appealing to my former associates
in Congress to vote fcr universal service and at least make
our own country safe for democracy.
Ever since the beginning of this European war the
Hearst publications have dilated upon the formidableness
of the German military machine and the necessity for im
mediate and immense effort on the part of our country if we
were to defend ourselves against that machine and even
tually overwhelm it.
If the advice of the Hearst publications had been taken,
we would be applying today in a determining way the
supreme force which the President now calls for and we
would be winning today the glorious victory which we will
assuredly win in due time anyway, in spite of delays, in spite
of obstacles, in spite of partisan obstruction and in spite of
treacherous attack in the rear by selfish politicians ani
mated by personal ambitions.
Let me say in conclusion that the attack upon the Ad
ministration, and the incidental attack upon the Hearst pub
lications, which are only seeking to secure justice for the
Administration, emanates from the reactionary influences
of Wall Street. The New York Tribune, which supports Mr.
Roosevelt in his unpatriotic activities, is owned by the Mills
and Reid estates, two of the greatest and most sinister oi
New York financial forces, and not even wholly Americar
in character, as the Mills and Reid families are both inter
married with the English aristocracy.
The Metropolitan Magazine, which hires Mr. Roosevelt
at a dollar a word, as professional vituperator of the Presi
dent, is owned by the Whitney estate, which is administered
by Harry Payne Whitney, grandson of Henry B. Payne, the
Standard Oil magnate, and son of William C. Whitney, the
New York traction magnate.
Nor is it unusual to find Mr. Roosevelt in such company
or in the financial favor of such influences.
Mr. Roosevelt in 1912 ran for President as a candidate
of the Steel Trust and to defeat Mr. Taft, who had prose
cuted the Steel Trust.
Mr. Roosevelt was financed by Mr. Perkins of the Steel
Trust, and when Mr. Perkins of the Steel Trust refused to
finance Mr. Roosevelt and his party in 1916, Mr. Roosevelt
Mr. Simonds clefinitelv stated and showed that his aesire shamefully betrayed his Progressive party into the hands of
to retire from this disloyal paper was due to the fact that
this paper habitually invented news and concocted cables
in its own office for the purpose of manufacturing false
material with which to attack the Government of the United
States and the army of the United States for small and self
ish political purposes.
Of course, Mr. Simonds would not willingly remain con
nected with any disloyal publication, no matter how profit
able that connection might be, but there is apparently noth
ing in Mr. Roosevelt's makeup to prevent his connection with
any publication, no matter how traitorous, as long as that
connection will serve to line his purse and further his un
scrupulous methods of promoting his personal political as
pirations. Mr. Roosevelt's attempted reflections upon the Hearst
publications are unimportant.
It is sufficient to say in reply that whatever criticism
the Hearst publications indulged in was constructive criti
cism founded upon established fact, not upon manufactured
ADVERTISEMENT
the reactionary Republicans.
Mr. Roosevelt has always been a badly camouflaged
instrument of these sinister financial interests from the time
that he personally, as President, allowed the United States
! StapI rnrnnratinn. in tliiCTfinr. violation of t.hp nnti-trnst lnwa
of the nation, to absorb the Tennessee Coal and Iron Com
pany, down to the time of the recent election in New York
City, when he followed the lead of the Steel Trust and the
Standard Oil Trust and declared against the nominee of his
own party who had been regularly nominated by the Re
publican voters in the open primary, which Mr. Roosevelt
had always advocated.
As Mr. Roosevelt and his unfounded allegations were
overwhelmingly repudiated in the New York City election,
and as Mr. Asquith and his unfounded allegations were ovei"
whelmingly repudiated in the House of Commons, so Mr.
Roosevelt and every political and public traitor should be
overwhelmingly repudiated whenever such an one sets him
self disloyally against his constituted leaders and against
the best interests of his country for the meanest of all mo
tives petty jealousy and personal gain. 0

E. Moyza, of Amadoville, Ari

I515-5t. Register.
Recent reports circulated in Ari
zona and other states to the effect
thai further need tor wheat conserva
tion is unnecessary are declared erro
neous in a special message by Her
bert Hoover to the paople of Arizona.
The message read? as follows:
"Every aspect of the wheat situa
tion both present and prospective, in
tensifies the need for the greatest
possible limitation in the American
consumption of wheat and wheat prod
ucts, if present testrietions should
be in the slightest degree relaxed it
wouid result in serious want (or the
people of the allie.l nations before lha
new ci op can reach the market.
"The fcod administration estimates
on the first of June a total available
supply until the new harvest of about
fifty-six million hushels. Of this, thir
ty million bushels must be exported
before new wheat is available tor ex
port. If we aie to maintain the ab
solutely necessary shipments to our
army and the Allies, that leaves about
twcnty-slx million bushels for domes
tic consumption for the next two
months. Normal American consump
tion is something ovc-r forty million
bushels a month, so that the most
liberal consumption at home should
be only one third of normal.
"The new harvest will not be gen
erally available in flour until the mid
dle of August or early in September,
although in the extreme south it will
be somewhat earlier:
"At a meeting of the federal food
administrators in Washington, repre
senting all forty-eight states, it was
th? unanimous view that even if the
harvest does prove abundant it will
be the first duty of the American peo
ple to place every grain they can save
into storage as against possible bad
years ahead. In consequence there
should be no anticipation of unlimited
wheat bread until the war is over.
"Some of the most inconvenient re
strictions can no doubt be modified
with the arrival of a large harvest, but
if we are honest with ouiselve3 we
will maintain restrictions requiring
the use of some substitutes in both
domestic and commercial bread."
The Spirit of Friendship.
This store looks upon its patrons not
merely as customers but as friends.
People purchase here because they
have friendly feeling for this store.
The cause which develops this friendly
feeling, may differ, in fact, they are

cient service and courteous treatment,
and so on.
Naturally this friendshiply feeling on

on out-part. And this spirit of mutual
friendship is an impetus for greater
service and an incentive to ever-increasing
endeavor to make this store
a place where every visitor will feel

I decided I would give Elack
Draught a thorough trial as I knew it
was highly recommended for this
trouble. I began taking it. I felt
better after a few doses. My appetite
improved and I became stronger. My
bowels acted naturally and the least
trouble was soon rishled with a few
