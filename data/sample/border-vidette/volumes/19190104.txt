The Spirit of Friendship.
This store looks upon its patrons not
merely as customers but as friends.
People purchase here because they
have friendly feeling for this store.
The cause which develops this friendly
feeling, may differ, in fact, they are
sure to differ. One's friendship for
the store is the result of finding good
values; another's is the result of effi
cient service and courteous treatment,
and so on.
Naturally this friendshiply feeling on
the part of our patrons is reciprocated
on our part. And this spirit of mutual
friendship is an impetus for greater
service and an incentive to ever-increasing
endeavor to make this store
a place where every visitor will feel
perfectly at home.

ARIZONA NOTES.
Items of Interest Culled From Our
Exchanges.
A rich and victorious nation
stands solidly back of war sav
ings stamps. They are as good
as gold cr be'ter, "for they bear
interest, which gold does not.
Arizona creameries will here
after be limited to a profit of five
cents a p und on butter by a
new maximum marcin establish
ed by the food administration,
it is announced. Heretofore the
butter margins have applied on
ly to wholesale and retail deal
ers.
That the school laws of Ari
zona are antiquated and inefti
eient. is the almost unanimous
decision of the leading educators
of the state. So there is to be
offered to the January Legisla
ture at least one bill that will
seek to find a better system,
even though it may need refer
ence to the people at the next
general election.
Col. John C. Greenway, gen
eral manager of the Calumet and
Arizona Mining company, who
secured leave of absence from
his directorate in order to serve
in the United States engineers,
has been released from the hos
pital in France, where he was
taken after being severely gas
ed by the Germans, and now is
reported to be en route to Ari
zona. War savings stamps that are
to be put on sale Jan. 1st, are cf
an entirely new size and design.
The new stamps are half the
size of the old ones and will be
sold at the same price, $4.12,
maturing in 1921. They are of
dark blue, and carry upon them
a likeness of Benjamin Prank
lip. The new thrift stamp cards
will also be ready for distribu
tion at the same time. They are
half the size of the former ones
and will tit a vest pocket.
Many counties in western Kan
sas are arranging rabbit drives
for this winter in the interest of
the Ked Cross and young vege
tation. It is said a canning com
pany has offered 15 cents for
2,0C0,0OO jack rabbits and 12
cents for cottontails. The dif
ferent between jacks and cot
tons is about the same as be
tween heifers and steers, a few
cents before the manufacturer
gets hold of them and none at
all afterward. Cattleman.
Postmaster General Burleson
in announcing reduced telephone
charges as part of government
control of telegraph and tele
phone lines will have the ap
proval of the people. Under
private ownership these utilities'
charges were constantly increas
ing. Telegraph rates have not
been advanced of late but the
ever increasing telephone rates
were becoming a source of an
noyance to business men who
rely on the telephone to save
I ime and travel.
Many tourists are passing west
ward over the Borderland route
and all of them are taking note
of the road work now being done
on the Borderland, and they will
be living witnesses of the ex
cellence of this route. It is more
than likely that a section of the
work being built by Toohey
Brothers will soon be opened for
use between Curtis Plat and
Tombstone. The intention is
now to have them complete the
work fully from the Benson end
so that the public can get the
earliest use of it. Prospector.
U. S. Civil Service Examination.
The United States Civil Ser
vice Commission again announ
ces an examination . for the posi
tion of stenographer and type
writer in the Field Service, at
Nogales, Arizona, on January
11, 1919.
There has been difficulty in
securing a sufficient number of
applicants for this position and
therefore all qualified persons
are urged to enter the examina
ticn.
Application blanks and furth
er information may be obtained
from the Local Secretary of the
Board of Civil Service Examin
ers at the United States Immi
gration Office, in Nogales.
THE PATAGONIA DISTHI'JT.
The Morning Glory is going
ahead with development work
and t?ood ore has been encount
ered. The World's Fair mine is im
proving steadily under the man
agement of Mr. Hiram Wbit-
comb.
Development work is continu
ing with gratifying results at
the Hosey property. It is re
ported that some good ore is
being encountered and that ship
ments will be made soon.
Work at the Exposed Reef
mines is going on steadily and
the operators expect soon to be
in shape to take out ore. Quart
ers have recently been built at
the property for the men.
Development at the Hermosa,
under the direction of Ed. Bohl
injrar is progressing satisfact
orily. The mine bad not been
worked fo. many years until
Col. R. R. Richardson acquired
a lease on it recently.
The 3-R sale has not yet been
concluded, but it is reported that
the near future will witness the
coming into the district of the
Magma Copper company. Their
advent here will improve con
ditlons here more than anything
that has occurred in mining cir
cles since mining started here.
The Pierce Gardner lease at
Harshaw is improving with de
velopment. The vein of high
grade ore which was but five
feat wide at the beginning and
of about $50 in value per ton has
widened to seven feet and values
have increased to above $130 in
silver and $12 in gold. Both
men interested in the lease are
deserving of success after their
many years of work in the min
ing industry. Patagonian.
THEY ALSO SERVED.
There are some thousands of
soldiers here, others in the Big
Bend country and still more at
Camp Cody, Columbus and Doug
las, who are bitterly disappoint
ed that they did not get into the
lighting before the armistice was
declared. Their feeling is shar
ed by more than a million other
soldiers in cantonment, camps
aud stations, throughout the
United States.
These men at Fort Bliss and
elsewhere, who never got across,
did their duty fully and it was
no fault of theirs that the order
which would have taken them
over the Atlantic aud into bat
tie never came.
All of thes men ought to read
the letter from Major General
Leonard Wood, himself one of
the disappointed ones, handed
to every man mustered out at
Camp Funston. It follows:
"In the performance of mili
tary duty to one's country in
time of war it is not for the citi
zen called to the colors to select
the kind of service to be done
by him. One who has willingly
and loyally responded to the call
to arms, and who has put his
best efforts, mental and physi
cal, into training, and performed
all military duties required of
him to the best of his ability,
standing ready always to make
the supreme sacrifice of life it
self, if need be, has done all that
a good citizen and soldier could
do to insure the successful pro
secution of the war.
"Although I appreciate how
keenly you feel the disappoint
ment of your failure to secure
duty overseas in the actual bat
tie area, I know you rejoice to
gether with all Americans in the
prospect of a righteous and just
peace imposed upon the enemy
and the termination of the terri
ble conflict which has involved
the whole civilized world. You
have done your best. You have
cheerfully and loyally discharg
ed the clear duty of every citi
zen in time of war and your
work has been a part of the
great national effort which has
aided in securing a victorous
peace.
"You are discharged from the
army because your services are
no longer required in the pre
sent emergency. You will re
turn to your place in civil life
all the better for the training
you Lave had, and I feel sure
you will take with you a better
and higher appreciation of the
obligations of citizenship, in
cluding the obligation of every
man to be trained, prepared and
ready to render service to the
nation in war as well as in
peace." El Paso Herald.
LAND FOR RETURNING SOLDIERS
Much interest is being taken
by a number of returned soldiers
in the proposed Soldier Settle

mation regarding land resources

of the State, and the Committee
hopes to have all data revised
and compiled at an early date.
It is requested by the Commit
tee that all soldiers, who desire

known in California mining and
sporting circles as a prince of
good fellows, a competent min
ing engineer, and champion polo
player. When England entered
the great war, Colonel Besley,
then a captain, joined the Eng

Thursday morning Captain W.
J. Dawson, one of the oldest
best known mining engineers in

erties in which he and his asso
ciates are interested. Captain
Dawson was a personal friend of
such illustrious mine operators
as Marcus Daly of Butte, Mon
tana, and Col. W. C. Greene of
Cananea. It is understood that
Captain Dawson and his asso
ciates, have secured a number of
valuable mining properties in
Souora, which give promise of
developing into dividend payers.
With plenty of capital and Capt.
Dawson's great experience, we
predict big things for the min
ing district in which the captain
is taking a personal interest.

By GERALD STANLEY LEE.
I had n friend once named Old BUI
Bpertr. who wris tlie curator nnd found
er of i!:e John Qnlncjr Adams Memorial
In Quinry, Mass. He conceived the
Idea of making the house Into a ma
norial and, wiili liis genius ns a col
lector of old furniture, Blled it with
tilings to see.
People came from i verywhere, and
tit twenty-five rents :ip:ece tliey went
about (o sop the things Hill had eol
lecird and hear Hill talk.
Bill fell very superior to most col
lectors. "Just collect rs," Bill maid,
collect anything.1
Bill ur-ually could people up wheti
they rmne in the Ioor. but when he
wasn't quite sure ultout people, and su
peotcd ho d!d;i't mint to bother with
them very !or.sr. he us?d to tnUo them up
to the ottic to size them up quick. Ho
would show then, a bushel IvisUetful of
something they couldn't quite see, and
then he would wave his hand with a
flourish and nay In an impressive tono
ats thy ;icid lo look closer, "This la
tl.O I.ar?re.t Collection tf Burnt Matches
in tlie World!"
Hundreds of cc.'.tee'.ors didn't break a
amiic. tii'tl Fwid, nud Just looi.od awed.
Then BUI knew, of course, that h
needn't bother to show them film heat
things.
Some of the people wToe are proposing
to s"o ot:t into the streets Ued Cross
Christr.-as Roll Call Week and father up
everybody to join the Red Cross, seem
to think that the main thin there la
to tell people about the Ited Cross la
that if they pay a dollar to belong they
will belong to the Largest Collection of
People Who Have raid One Dollar la the
World.
I felt a little superior to this at Brat
end betran thinking how I wouldn't do It.
I?ut when I began thinking what the
biggest Collection of People In the World
could do by Ju."t beins the bigxest and
by all wanting the same thins: with a
different one dollar, It became Impres
sive. It would ever, be impressive If forty
million people In America all wanted the
same thinjr with the same Dollar!
All wanting the same llilntc would be a
nation praying all the a-rown-up people
ef a nation with their little half con
scious children round them praylnjr!
The doiiar a man joined with, would
not be a mere one dollar. The dollar
would be a receipt lo every man In
America that 35.SS0.P99 other men or
women belonged to him. and that he be
longed to them in getting what he want
ed for three million so'.dler boys and for
their children at home.
!
Worty million people all the grown-up
people In this country pick out three
million men and say to the three million
men they have picked out, "You go and
die for us, you ro and bo saviors of the
world and die on our croi?K for us!"
Then what do the forty million do?
It would be be something if we would
ill line up the whole forty million of
us to a man. with our little pallid insipid
speechless dollar biils In our hands from
Maine to California Christmas Week and
use our two dollar bills a year as ballots.
Stand up in line and be counted and
cable to the men across the ica that
we vote one carfare once in two weeks
to" stand by them, to stand by the souls
and bodies of the children of the men
who have made a standing offer to die
on our crosses for us!
Who wants to be left out of this line
ly Christmas Kve?
What man would want to be !ood up
In a row of those who are left out while
all cf the children of the world file by
and look at him. v.-hil the little children
of nine hundred thousand dfad men in
Entrland file by and look at hlra. or the
children of the soldiers of France giving
their lives to protect the skyscrapers of
New York?
For that matter It nee.-i not take so
many children. What man who let him
self be left out would feel safe In his
own house with hie own children climbing
up Into his lap belisvins In him safe
with hlt owr. -by pulling on his face,
jabbing his small trustful fisla In his
eyes If he let himself be left out?
Of course. It seema a little like a
mockery to cable over to France Chriet
mas Eve that we elve one carfare once
In two weeks to the children of the men
we picked out to die for us, but It would
be a start.
Nobody needs) to think It would be a
big thing Just to belong to the F.cd Cross,
but It la going to be a big thing te be
left out.
