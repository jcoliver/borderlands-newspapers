COURTESY.
The Spirit of Friendship.
This store looks upon its patrons not
merely as customers but as friends.
People purchase here because they
have friendly feeling for this store.
The cause which develops this friendly
feeling, may differ, in fact, they are
sure to differ. One's friendship for
the store is the result of finding good
values; another's is the result of effi
cient service and courteous treatment,
and so on.
Naturally this friendshiply feeling on
the part of our patrons is reciprocated
on our part. And this spirit of mutual
friendship is an impetus for greater
service and an incentive to ever-increasing
endeavor to make this store
a place where every visitor will feel
perfectly at home.

Items of Interest Culled From Our
Exchanges.
Cantaloupe shipments out of
the Salt River valley total to
date for the season' 591 carloads,
as against 514 carloads to date
last year.
Congress has passed a bill ap
propriating 32,000 to pay dam
ages to Douglas people injured
by stray bullets in the battles at
Agua Prieta.
The government is calling for
25,000 young women to join the
United States Student Nurse
Reserve and hold themselves in
readiness to train for service as
nurses.
A big increase in postal re
ceipts at the Tucson postoftice
for the first half of the year 1918
is reported by Postmaster J. M.
Ronstadt. The increase over the
first six months of 1917 is $11,
558 76.
For violating the regulations
of the restaurant division of the
food administration, Chas. Quam,
proprietor of the American
Kitchen, of Mesa, was fined $100
and his place of business closed
for three days.
Con P. Cronin, state law and
reference librarian, has been
named by Governor Hunt as the
representative of Arizona at the
twenty-eighth annual meeting of
the national conference of com
missioners on uniform laws to
be held at Cleveland, Ohio, Aug.
22 to 27.
Almost simultaneously with
the announcement that the price
of copper would be made 26
cents, an advance of 2i cents,
came the announcement of the
Phelps Dodge Corporation of an
increase in the wages of the
miners employed by their organ
ization.
Dr. Rosas Boido, convicted by
a jury in Judge Stanford's divi
sion of the Superior Court in
Maricopa county on a charge of
performing a criminal operation
and sentenced to serve two years
in the state prison at Florence,
has been paroled by the State
Board of Pardons and Paroles.
Charles F. V. Petersdorff, at
one time city engineer of Tuc
son, will very shortly return to
his home entirely clear of any
charges against him on the part
of the federal government. The
indictments, charging him with
complicity in the Hindu con
spiracy, for which he was ar
rested some months ago, have
been dismissed. Likewise, his
bondsmen have been released.
A big appropriation bill of
congress carries with it an ap
propriation of 1,800,000 for the
remodeling, extension and im
provement of Whipple barracks.
It is probable that old Fort
Whipple will be made a con
valescent camp, and there are
really few places that are more
suitable than that altitude for
certain ailments, and no more
pleasing surroundings than the
pine-clad hills of old Yavapai.
A bulletin issued by the Amer
ican mining congress, Arizona
chapter, says that acceptance of
the advance in wages in the
mining districts of the state is
indicated to have been in the
spirit of a joint achievement on
the part of operators and oper
atives and with other favorable
outcomes of the cooperative
spirit that has prevailed this
year has made for a greatly im
proved situation in the state at
large.
Arizona has passed the Two
Million Dollar mark in the sale
of War Savings Stamps. On
August first from reports of the
Post Office and banks in the
State to the State Director's of
fice, the figures show $2,029,019
maturity value sold, over Four
Hundred Thousand Dollars worth
of stamps were purchased in
July which, considering the
weather in some parts of the
State, was very good. Cochise
county sold over One Hundred
Thousand Dollars worth. Green
lee, Coconino and Gila counties
also made creditable showings.
It is hoped that August will
prove another good month.
CIDNEY P. OS BORN has been Secretary
of State have you ever heard a criti
cism of the conduct of that office?
Hundreds of thousands of dollars and
millions of important details have been
handled there without a bobble, because he
applies Business Sj'stem instead of Political
Buncomb.
OSB
ORN KNOWS HOW
Let's stop experimenting Let's run
this state as a big business, with a com
petent manager who is "First of All for
Arizona."
BORN FOR
Primary,
KEEP TRACK OF OUR BOYS.
Communities are urged to keep
track of their men in the service
and to recognize their deeds of
merit whenever they are report
ed in the official or unofficial
dispatches. This suggestion is
made by the military morale
section of the office of the chief
of staff.
It is suggested that local com
munities establish an honor roll
for the recognition of all acts of
bravery and heroism. Each local
community is urged to select a
reader who will closely scan all
of the official and unofficial re
ports from the front for the
mention.of men enlisted from
that locality.
Letter of recognition of acts
of bravery or heroism are to be
written to the ones deserving
them, these letters to be not
longer than one page and to be
of a character to make them
desirable for reserving. Similar
letters are to be written to the
next of kin and copies sent to
the local newspapers.
This and many other matters
will be taken up by the state
council of defense as soon as the
county councils have been form
FOR
GOVERNOR
GOVERNOR
Sept. lO
ed. The work of the state coun
cil is being somewhat held up
by not having these county
councils, it is stated at head
quarters. As soon as the coun
ty councils are established the
work of the state council will
proceed more rapidly.
FOREST SERVICE HELPS.
Range has been provided on
the Black Hills National Forest,
S. Dak., for 2,500 yearling steers
from drought stricken sections
ot Arizona. Fifty four cars were
required to carry the cattle, and
it was necessary to leave behind
a large number of stock which
were too weak to travel.
This action is in line with the
policy of the Forest Service
looking to the fullest utilization
of the national forest range dur
ing the war emergency. Fences
to prevent cattle drifting from
ranges will be constructed and
watering places will be improv
ed on the Black Hills area by
the Forest Service and the own
ers of the stock in cooperation.
It is planned to feed t he-stock
next winter, and after a second
season on the range, to ship
them direct to market. Ex.
Hon. David P. Johnson, the
popular candidate for member
ship on the Arizona Corporation
Commission, was a visitor at
Teinpe today. Mr. Johnson has
many democratic friends at this
place who are enthusiastically
supporting his candidacy. They
believe his qualifications for the
office are superior to those of
any other candidate in the field.
For ten years he held one of the
largest and most responsible
positions in the state that of
chief office man for the Copper
Queen Company, which is cer
tainly a splendid testimonial as
to his business ability. He has
acceptably filled the office of
state treasurer for two terms
and served as state examiner for
one term. He is thoroughly ac
quainted with the various busi
ness interests in the state with
which Corporation Commission
has to do, and in addition to all
this he has at all times proven
himself to be a courteous and
obliging official, with whom it is
a pleasure to do business. Tem
pe News.
DEFICIENT RAINFALL.
Due to the spotted distribution
of the rains throughout the
vicinity of Tucson, the cattle
men have not been benefitted by
the rainfall as much as in provi
ous years. The reports show
that during the month of July
last year there was an average
of around 12 inches of rain,
while at the present time it is
safe to say that there -has not
been one third that amount for
the month just ending.
In nearly every case the cat
tlemen varify the statement that
the prospects for this year will
not come up to the standard un
less the month of August turns
out to be exceptionally rainy.

FROM "OVER THERE."
Judge Prank J. Duffy, last
Wednesday received an interest
ing letter from his son. Sergeant
Francis Duffy of the American
Expeditionary Forces, "some
where in France, in which Fran
cis said:
"This is the first chance I
have had to write a letter.
"We left the United States on
June 13th and were on the water
la days. We certainly had nice
weather coming over, did not
even have a bad wind storm and
very few men were sea sick.
We had a large convoy, and a
couple of days before we got to
England several small battle
ships of some kind came out to
meet us so we got there with no
danger of submarines. Every
one had to wear a life preserver
all the time while on the ship,
but no one thought of having
any trouble. We had a mando
lin, banjo and violin, so we had
lots of music. We were in Eng
land a couple of days at a rest
camp, then came to France and
stayed another day at another
rest camp, and then traveled
two days and nights on the train
and here we are. We are about
two miles from town, and cer
tainly have a fine place for a
camp. There is a big swimming
hole about a mile from camp,
and there are farm houses all
around. There are lots of pine
trees and the people have them
tapped for pitch. It makes me
think of the maple trees in Wad-dintfton."
JOE TEMPLE RETURNS SOUTH
H. J. Temple, general super
intendent of the Southern Pa
cific of Mexico, with head
quarters at Einpalmo, arrived
from Tucson yesterday and this
morning went south in the pri
vate car "Sonora," his traveling
home.
Mr. Temple looks the picture
of health, notwithstanding the
fact that he wortts like a beaver,
early and late, with seldom a
vacation at the beaches in Cali
fornia, where most people go for
the summer. He and his estima
ble family have a pleasant home
at Empalme, near Guaymas,
where they spend most of their
time, when official business does
not call Mr. Temple out on the
road.
For more than a quarter of a
century Joe Temple has been
J with tfie reatr Southern Pacific,
nevertheless, he's more than
half human, and always ready
and willing to meet the public
more than half way. As a re
sult, he enjoys the fullest confi
dence of everybody.
Men of Joe Temple's ability
and sterling worth, are rapidly
"passing out of the picture."
They'll be missed.

In other states certain meat re
strictions are still retained, but
with an abundance of beef, pork

THE BIG MILITARY PARADE.
The deferred parade and re
view of the 35th Infantry, about
two thousand men, under com
mand of Colonel Frier, last
Thursday afternoon, was a great
success in every way, and will
be pleasantly remembered a long
time by our people, thousands
of whom cheered our brave boys
as they marched through the
streets, headed by the famous
35th Infantry band.
Had the day been selected by
Colonel Frier himself, it could
not have been finer.
The column started from Camp
Stephen D. Little, promptly at
three o'clock, marched south on
Grand avenue to the Banks
bridge, which was crossed to
Morley avenue, following that
thoroughfare to Park street,
thence to Grand avenue, and
down that street to Camp Little.
At the Town Hall, Colonel
Frier and his aide dismounted
and took station in the review
ing stand, and reviewed the
finest body of soldiers ever seen
in Nogales, the fighting 35th,
soon to take their position on
the firing line "Over there."
In the reviewing stand, be
sides Colonel James Frier were
Mayor James A. Harrison, ex
Mayor H. M. Clagett, U. S. Col
lector of Customs C. L. Hardy,
United States Consul E. W.
Lawton, Superior Judge W. A.
O'Connor, Colonel Allen T. Bird,
chairman of the arrangement
committee; J. B. Bristol, secre
tary of the Chamber of Com
merce, and Councilman Wirt G.
Bowman.
All along the line of march,
Uncle Sam's fighters, who pre
sented a splendid appearance,
were applauded.
When they leave Nogales
they'll take our best wishes with
them. AUGUST 10, 1918.
Stand By Wilson -Win H12 War.
Representative Scott Ferris,
Chairman of the Democratic Na
tional Congressional Campaign
Committee, speaking at the Iowa
Democratic State Convention
said :
"There is but one issne before
the Nation this day. That is to
lift aloft the banner of demo
cracy and maintain the freedom
of mankind and to stamp out
once and for all German mili
tarism and German autocracy.
There may be other ways to
achieve this, but I know of only
this one. That is to stand by
the regularly constituted otln ers
of the Government, stand by
them to the end !
" 'Stand by the President'
should and will be the shi bboleth
of this campaign. Stand by the
flag, stand by the country, stand
by the President, for these, dur
ing war times, are synonyms.
"During the Civil War Presi
dent Lincoln and his every pol
itical adviser said, 'S:and by the
President, stand by the Hag, and
stand by the country. ' The Na
tion obeyed the summons. Dur
ing the Spanish American War,
President McKinley, Theodore
Roosevelt, and every political
adviser, said 'Stand by the Pre
sident,' and the country obeyed
the summons.
'Today, in a war that is more
far-reaching than all the rest,
when the Nation in which we
live is trembling from turret to
foundation stone, there is but
one appeal that should be made
and needed by every citizen of
the land, of whatever political
party, of whatever creed 'Stand
by the flag, stand by the coun
try, stand by the President.' "
