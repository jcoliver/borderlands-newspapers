America's foreign trade in
1917 reached the unpredented
total of $8,953,000,000, of which
$6,294,000,000 was exports and
2,659.000,000 imports. Exports
in June, the last month of the
fiscal year, totaled 676,000,000,
the highest of any month in the
country's history with the ex
ception of last January. Im
ports during the month were
valued at 307,000,000.
An appeal is being made by J.
H. McClure, local agent of the
Southern Pacific company, to
all local shippers, for heavier car-
loading. He states that in the
past the reason for car shortage
is that whole cars have been
used to ship only half of their
capacity. If the public will co
operate, McClure asserts, things
will loosen up and there-will be
less tieups on the road Citizen.
According to information from
Prescott, Judge Lyman of the
Superior Court, Division No. 2,
of Maricopa county, sitting in
Yavapai county, has rendered a
decision in the county salary
case of that county, holding the
salary law passed by the last
legislature to be inapplicable to
county officers incumbent at the
time of the enactment of the
law. In some of the counties,
boards of supervisors have al
lowed the increased salaries.

With over forty experienced
forest officers on their way to
France, and these only partially
replaced by inexperienced men,
the National Forests of the
Southwest are running short

made to district Forester Red

asking for special care on the
part of the public in handling
their camp fires, matches and
tobacco while on the forests.
To the members of the First
Baptist church of Tucson, who
have enlisted in the service of
the United States, a roll of honor
was unveiled Sunday morning
at the First Baptist church. The
pastor, Rev. John H. Clifford,
gave a patriotic address and the
audience sang several songs.
The names engraved on the roll
include Lloyd Andrews, F.

Attorney General Wiley Jones
in an opinion delivered to Ad
jutant General Harris, denied
tne power of the governor to
remove mm irom omce or to
abolish the office. Generally the
opinion is based on various
statutes which provide that of
ficers shall continue in the dis
charge of their duties and in
custody of public properties un
til their successors are elected
or appointed and qualified. Gov
ernor Campbell on Saturday
night asked for the resignation
of the adjutant general and on
the following Monday declared
his office to be vacant.

Patagonian.
The Value of Army Training.
Much of the adversion to the
draft which was manifested in
the early days of the call was
due to a misconception of the
nature of military life and tne
hardships it entails.
Few men are cowards, but all
men like comfort. To one com
fort may mean a town house and
a country house.a nock of motor
cars and a yacht. To another
a tenement room opening on a
fire eacape, and on the shady
side of the street. The one is
as loath to exchange his com
forts for, the problematical hardr
ships of the camp and the trench,
as the other.
That it is dread of the loss of
liberty, the rigors of discipline,
the life by command and by rule,
and the petty discomforts of the
camp rather than the actual or
deal of battle that deters men
from the enlistment is shown by
the fact that voluntary recruit
ing always swells with the pro
bability of active service. The
a&sertion that the marines are
"always the first to fight" has
been the most effective enlisting
slogan of the whole recruiting
period. ;
Had the youth of our land en
joyed the advantages of compul
sory and universal military train
ing there would be manifest to
day none of this reluctance to
enlistment which appears in
many quarters. Young men
would know that the process of
making a soldier results in the
making of a man a man sound
m mind and body, trained to
meet emergencies, to face peril
unflinchingly, to obey orders
and to carry himself intelligent
ly and resourcefully when no
orders are forthcoming. The
trained mind will be backed by
a sound body. The weaklings
of our city streets are built up
to manhood by the physical ex
ercise which comes with the
months of preliminary training.
Our slouching farm hands will
be transformed into erect and
commanding figures of men. No
man ever enjoyed the advantages
of military training even
though forced upon him and
regretted it. What it has done
for the cockneys of London has
been the marvel of all England
Had we begun at least three
years ago giving this training to
the youth of our land we should
have had now the nucleus of
an army trained in body and
mind for war. Much of the
scandal attending the present
rush for exemptions would have
been averted. But while we
have wasted valuable years the
time to take up universal train
ing is here and now. Tucson

AMERICAN EFFICIENCY.
German efficiency has been
held up as a degree of excellece
unattainable by a democracy.
The accomplishments of the
United States since April 5th
last seem to refute the truth of
the claim. In the short space
of time since that day the Unit
ed States has accomplished the
following:
Declared a state of war as ex
isting between this country and
Germany.
Seized 91 German ships and
begun repair work on them.
Authorized unanimously a war
fund of 7,000,000,000.
Appropriated 600,000,000 for
merchant shipping and as much
for air fleets.
Agreed to loan our allies 3,
000,000,000, and advanced them
a large proportion of that sum.
Passed a selective draft law,
and in a single day registered
nearly ten million men for milita
ry service. '
Enlisted 600,000 volunteer
soldiers in the regular army and
the National Guard of the
States.
Sent a commission to Russia
to aid democracy there and a
body of railroad men to Russia
and another to France to advise
and assist in railroad transporta
tion in those countries.
Begun the construction of 32
camps for our soldiers.
Sent to England a fleet of de
stroyers and to France a detach
ment of troops.
Authorized and now enforcing
embargo whereby our enemies
will receive no more food or
material from us.
Passed a food conservation
law.
Organized many volunteer
commissions and boards which
are aiding the government and
the people in speeding up the
work, conservation of food, and
other national movements.
Drafted by lot 687,000 men for
military service.
While the (jovernmant was
accomplishing these things the
American people have loaned
the United States two billion
dollars and offered a billion
more, over four million citizens
subscribing go the loan. In ad
dition they have given over
100,000,000 to the 'Ameri
can Red Cross and 3,000,000 to
the Young Men's Christian as
sociation.
All these things were accom
plished while our soil was not
invaded or even threatened with
invasion and without any dis
turbance of business conditions
WHAT IS GOOD GASOLINE ?
In an article, dealing with the
Bureau of Mines tentative gaso
line specifications, Oildom for
March, 1917, says: "In these
specifications gravity is omitted
entirely as a basis for test, vola
tility being the basic property
for determining the grade and
usefulness of gasoline."
Volatility is just another
term for boiling points," said
Mr. J. E. Balsley, district sales
manager of Standard Oil Com
pany, in discussing these pro
posed specifications.
' Motor fuel efficiency depends
on the boiling points or volatil
ity of gasoline, just as the Bu
reau of Mines indicated. ' These
boiling points must be in a con
tinuous chain, an unbroken,
gradually rising series- low boil
ing points for easy starting, me
dium boiling points for quick
and smooth acceleration, high
boiling points for power and
mileage.
"Needless to say, gasoline hav
ing this correct series of boiling
points cannot be made by mix
ing or blending. There are too
many intermediate points to be
provided to make the unbroken
chain. On the other hand, in
straight refinery gasoline, the
continuous chain of boiling
points is developed naturally
during distillation."
A WAR IN EARNEST.
' I hope none of you think
that this war into which we have
entered is going to be either
short or cheap or bloodless, or
that we are facing an exhausted
enemy; that is not the way we
feel here about it. The spirit
in which we look at it is as if we
stood alone against our antag
onist at his best. No other way
is safe; from our point of view,
no other way is possible.
"Now that means sacrifice for
us all. Ten Cabinet boys are on
the job now, in either the army
or navy; we have tried to do our
share. It means that we have
got to pay taxes; we have got to
take up loans not one, nor two
nor three nor four, perhaps
please do not feel as if two
thousand million dollars was a
very enormous contribution to
ward this job. It may be only
the beginning; it is certainly on
ly the beginning, so far as we
can now forsee. Do not let us
treat it as if that would put an
end to it. Seven thousand mil
lion is a big sum but it may have
to come once and again. Let us
hope it may not have to come a
third time. Two millions of men
are a good many, but they may
not be enough, there may be
more. All that lam saying this
for is to have you feel and teach
that this is a serious job a job
which is going to take courage
and brawn, but we have got to
clean it up, once and for all, and
make it safe to be a free peo
ple." Secretary of Commerce
William C. Redfield, to the So
ciety of Automotive Engineers
at Washington.
TOMBSTONE -NOGALES.
The suggestion that the state
highway be changed so that one
line goes to Nogales from Tomb
stone and the other to Vail
through Benson, is a mighty
good business proposition in
view of the faot that it would
materially aid the proposed mili
tary highway by taking in Doug
las, Bisbee, Tombstone, Fair
bank, Elgin and Patagonia to
Nogales: then up to Tucson and
make the distance six miles
shorter and cut oat the bugaboo
of the Empire Ranch.
The distance to Tucson would
alone be shortened twelve miles
and serve the localities of Curtis
St. David and Benson and the
Robinson Pomerene district.
This idea has the original en
dorsement of Lamar Cobb, pre
decessor of Tom Maddock, state
engineer, and it is also said to
have the endorsement of Mr.
Maddock.
Both routes would then avoid
the almost impassable Empire
Ranch, where one is lost to all
accommodations in the way of
supplies. The Tombstone Pros
