Interesting News Items Clipped From
the Patagonian.
The World's Pair mine has
been closed down for a few days
this week as a result of the
breaking of a cylinder head in
the engine.
The first car of ore from the
new Mowry strike has oeen
shipped and others will follow
as soon as it can be hauled in.
C. B. Wilson has one eight horse
team and one truck on the haul,
which equipment will be inci eas
ed as the facilities for getting
out the ore are improved.
The copper silver ore recently
brought in by J. C. Longstreet
from the Silver Pick claim, men
tion of which was made in a
recent issue of the Patagonian,
assayed 71 per cent copper and
52 ounces in silver to the ton.
Since this ore was uncovered a
cave in has destroyed 50 let of
shaft and much labor will be
necessary before the work of
development can prccaed on this
property.
J. and Neil McDonald have
been informed that the Eastern
gentlemen who are prospective
purchasers of the Augusta mine
will arrive in the district about
May 1. The Augusta, also call
ed the Hosey, is located about a
mile northwest of the American
Boy, and in former years ship
ped many carloads of high grade
copper ore, especially in il)V)
and 1910, at which time the
property was under bond to
William Kemp of Tucson and
the Calumet and Arizona com
pany.
H. H. McCutchan recently fin
ished hauling the gallows frame
and machinery, to the Copper
Ledge property of Shannon and
Dowd. This material is now in
place. The raise has been com
pleted and sinking will proceed
at once. This property, which
joins the Exposed Reef on the
southeast, eives promise of de
veloping into a real producer
with the completion of the work
now under way. Mr. Dowd was
in Patagonia Monday on busi
ness in connection with his property.
P. B. Hathaway of Los Ange
les, interested with August Bro-
dine in the Golden Rose group,
spent a few days in Patagonia
during the week looking after
his mining interests. The Golden
Rose is a copper-silver property
located at the old Weiland camp,
one mile northeast of the World's
Pair, which is being developed
under the direction of August
Brodine. Mr. Hathaway return
ed to his California home Wed
nesday morning and made the
statement that he was pleased
with the outlook on the Golden
Rose.
The Pierce Gardner lease on
the Black Eagle mining claim is
producing its two cars of high
grade silver ore each week with
almost monotonous regularity.
The ore body on this property is
fully measuring up to expecta
tions. It is reported that the
mine at present is looking better
than ever, and an 11 foot face of
high grade ore has been opened
up from the 50 foot level. The
mine at this date has practically
no dump, which speaks for itself
with regard to the size and rich
ness of the ore shoot.
Prank Reichert brought en
couraging news from the Alto
district last Monday and reports
mining conditions as rapidly im
proving. Among recent devel
opments in this section Mr.
Reichert mentioned the fact that
the Trudy now has a four-foot
face of milling ore in the lower
tunnel, still being 05 feet from
the winze in the upper tunnel.
which, when reached, will give
the Trudy a back of from 35 to
40 feet of high grade silver ore.
Mr. Reichert says operations
on the Bland have been resum
ed, a contract having been let
for a 100 foot cross cut, which,
when completed, win give a
depth of 270 feet. McGinley
and Smith are the lessees of this
copper silver property and are
expecting good results from pre
sent operations, owing to the
showing so far made.

took a bond and lease on the
Mammoth mine, has already put

few more cows than were under
actual permit, and let me say
right here: these cattle in many
instances were not counted,
merely estimated from the calf
branding. No man would kick
very much if his cattle were in
grass knee deep even if he waa
charged 60c per head per year;
which is exactly 3c per acre,
allowing 20 acres per animal;
but it was shown that nearly
every user of the reserve had to
buy high priced feed with which
to keep his cattle alive. Could
the forest reserve ranges be
transferred to the state and be
subject to state land lease every
man would welcome the change.
Then we could send our indivi
dual check once a year to Phoe
nix, pay for our land at the rate
of 3c per acre (which would be
60c per bead per year, base upon
the allowance of 20 acres per
animal,) and we would not be
harassed and dictated too, and
intimidated by forest reserve
employes. We would then be
master of our own airs and nob
obliged to bow our heads or
bend our knees in suppliance to
orders and regulations issued in
Washington, D. C. Our cattle
would not be counted, nor would
we be charged for the few fence
posts we used in improving oar
holdings. Another bowl was
long and loud regarding the ad
vanced rate on leased land, be
ing now almost double what we
pay the state for the same class
of land, but in this the worst of
seasons, our fathers in Wash
ington, D. C, being ignorant of
existing conditions in this sec
tion, have raised the price from
5c per acre to 8c. Who ever
heard of such an injustice being
dealt to a long suffering and
patient people? We users of the
National would be Porest in this
section have submitted to injus
tices which no prince, king or
potentate would ever think of
imposing upon their subjects,
but the "worm will turn," and
unless I misread human nature
the old time practices of forest
reserve employees are drawing
to a close, and the cowmen are
going to rise up in just and
honest indignation and demand
their rights, and like the fall of
all dynasties (our avowed en
emy.) The would be National
Porest must fall; and happy will
be the day; then we can assemble
at the Santa Rita and make
merry. Yours for the freedom
and management of our own
affairs.

a force of men to work and will
vigorously prosecute develop
ment work on this copper-silver
property, which for the present
will consist of sinking. A. splen
did plant is already installed on
this property and it is Mr. Hol
land's opinion that he will de
velop a real mine on the Mam
moth within a short time. For
merly this property was handi
capped by water, but this trouble
has been entirely overcome and
all indications point to the fact
that development work will pro
ceed without interruption.
The American Boy mine, which
has just been taken over by A.
P. Gross of Duluth, was located
a number of years ago by Geo.
Clarke, the old pioneer of So
noita Valley, and the recent
transfer of the property is grati
fying toMr.Clark's many friends
who are pleased to know that
Mr. Clarke, as well as his part
ners, Jens Peterson and Carl.L.
Scheler, have at last "come into
their own" after many years of
hard work. The American Boy
is located near the Hosey prop
erty, in the Santa Rita moun
tains, about lO miles from Pata
gonia, and during the process oi
development has yielded con
sideiable high grade ore which
was shipped to Douglas and El
Paso.
Those in a position to know
predict that when the work con
templated by Mr. Gross is com
pleted the American Boy will
occupy a prominent place among
the producers of this district.
John Costello, who has also
transferred his property to Mr.
Gross, located the Costello group
in 1907, and in connection with
others has expended in the
neighborhood of 5000 in devel
opment work, which resulted in
uncovering shipping ore in two
places in the Deep Down claim.
Considerable ore has been ship
ped from this property, prin
cipally silver-lead. Mr. Costello
has received an initial payment
of $1000 from Mr. Gross.
CATTLEMEN HOWL.
Don't Like the Way Some Forest Re
serves Are Managed.
Oro Blanco, Arizona. At the
meeting of the Southwest Cattle
Growers' Association, assembled
in Tucson on Friday, April 4th,
it was the general opinion ex
pressed among the cattlemen
present that the Forest Reserves
in Southern Arizona should be
abolished. Never before have I
heard such a general howl from
the users of the reserve. In the
first place it was apparent that
the forest reserve people bad
sold, and received, the money
for something they did not have;
grass and water, those being the
two most important things to
every cowman's existence. If
any man on earth hates to give
up his hard earned cash and re
ceive no value for same, that
gentleman is the cowman. Give
him his money's worth in any
thing, from grass and water to
a poker game, and he is satis-
tied. The big squeal which re
sounded through the halls and
corridors of the Santa Rita was
over the increased grazing fees
and the unjust fines which were
being imposed on account of the
! Forest Ranger having counted a
CLIMATE SUPREME.
Honest to goodness, the clim
ate of this particular section of
the Great Southwest has got
everything in the climate line
backed off the boards. Sunny
California, when compared to
Santa Cruz county, looks like a
selling plater compared to a
stake horse. It's a 20 to 1 shot
that we have more sunny days
in a year than does the Golden
State or even far-famed Italy.
Be honest, you people who
have traveled far and near and
most of you have did you ever
see more beautiful mornings,
more sunny noons, more perfect
twilights or more balmy moon
light nights than are experienc
ed right hereon the Borderland?
Why, it's "worth while" just
to be alive and breathe the pure
air of this wonderful country of
Ours a country that is incom
parable from any point of view.

LOOKING BACKWARD.
Looking backward over the
two years that have lapsed since
that memorable day, April G,
1917, when President Wilson
signed the joint resolution of
Congress that formally aligned
America with the Natioos of the
earth that were fighting to save
civilization and liberty from be
coming a mere memory, it is
difficult to conceive that the span
has' been so brief.
Mortal mind rinds it difficult
to grasp the immensity of the
stupendous events that have
transpired in that brief time, for
every day has been filled with
glorious deeds, each worthy a
page in history; deeds of devo
tion, of sacrifice, of duty done,
deeds that will grow brighter
and more glorious in the per
spective of the years; deeds that
time will illumine until they
shine' with a brightness unpar
alleled in all the ages.
The wonderful story of Amer
ica's accomplishments since her
might was hurled into the breach
to stay the onrush of the horde
of Huns that spring day two
years, ago is a record of the
achievement of the unparalleled,
of the seemingly impossible, and
will form the brightest chapter
in the world's history. The
names of those men who by their
deeds of sacrifice, of patriotism
and of devotion to duty furnish
ed the theme for this wonderful
story Will form a roll of honor
to be inscribed on tablets of
memory that will never perish.
The wonderful story of Amer
ica and the World War the
greatest of all the ages will be
told in song and story, will be
illustrated with . the painter's
brush, and the figure that will
stand out in greatest relief, that
will loom largest on the horizon
of history, growing with every
passing year and an inspiration
for every American youth, will
be that of the courageous, the
indomitable but patient Presi
dent, Woodrow Wilson.
Inspired by partisan and sel
fish ambitions traducers are at
tempting to defeat the very pur
poses of this man who now sits
at the peace table, seeking to
achieve the full fruits of the vic
tory, that has been won at the
cost of so much blood and treas
ure; seeking to bring to a war
worn world an era of lasting
peace. Washington and Lincoln
had their traducers, little men
who sought to detract from the
greatness of men they could not
even imitate; men whose purity
of purpose and towering intel
lect they could not appreciate.
But like Washington and Lin
coln, Wilson will grow in the
love and admiration of his coun
try and the world until his figure
towers alongside those of the
greatest men of all time Wil
son, the father of the new freedom.
Highway to Nngales Needs Repairs.
The Prospector road hound re
cently drove over the Border
land from Tombstone to Turner,
then through the gap and on
through Empire ranch to the
half way point by that route to
Tucson. The road was very
good, the poor part being from
Turner to the Santa Cruz line in
Cochise county. A few rocks
which could easily be removed
in a fjew days by a repair gang.
The.one noticeable new thing
besides the improvement of the
roads towards Elgin and Sonoita
after you' leave the Borderland
was the new "refreshment and
supply station" recently erected
and being operated by Mr. and
Mr3. Johnson, at the corner
where you leave the Borderland
for Elgin. This enterprising
couple have what they are
pleased to call "The Rain Val
ley Inn.," and here one can feed
both himself and his machine
or he may get a bed if he wishes
to rest. Everything about the
Inn and store are neat and clean.
This little Inn will be the scene
of many a chicken dinner on
Sundays and will be another
asset to the Borderland route.
The Johnsons are people who
know how. The repair of this
road from Turner to the Santa
Cruz line should be done as soon
as possible, as a big travel is
going over this route, not only
to Tucson but to Patago-jia and
Nogales as well. Prospector.
TIME EXTENSION GRANTED.
Phoenix. April Collector
of Internal Revenue Franklin
has received the following in
tructions in regard to an exten
sion ol time for the tiling of cor
poration reports:
"In view of the short time be
tween the date on which forms
were available and the due date
(March 15) of calendar year re
turns required under the Reve
nue Act of 1918, notice was given
through the public press and
otherwise that tentative returns
accompanied by a first install
ment of one fourth of the estim
a ted tax due would be accepted
on that dale, and that in such
cases forty-live days would be
given in which to file completed
returns.
"In the case of corporations
which tiled a tentative return on
or before March 15, a further!
extension, where needed, to June
J5, 1919, in which to file com
plete returns is hereby granted,
but all such corporations will be
required to pay on or before
June 15, a sum sufficient, with
the amount paid on March 15, to
equal one half of the tax due as
shown by the completed return,
together with interest at the rate
of one half of 1 per cent per
month on any deficiency in the
first installment.
"It is not deemed necessary to
grant an extension of time be
yond the forty five days origin
ally granted for the completion
of personal returns, except on
special request therefor, where
sufficient reasons are given, but
the above ruling as to interest
in deficient installments applies
to them.
"The time for filing returns of
information, fiduciary returns,
withholding returns, returns of
partnerships, and personal ser
vice corporations required to file
returns on a calendar year basis,
and all other returns required
under the income tax and profits
tax provisions of the law which
are not the basis for the assess
ment of the tax, is also extended
to June 15, 1919.
