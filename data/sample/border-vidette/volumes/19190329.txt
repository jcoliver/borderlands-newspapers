MINING REVIEW.
Developments of the Past Week in the
Different Districts.
a (Santa Cruz Patagonian.)
An unusually attractive pros
pect has been "brought to light"
by Messrs. Ismond, McCall and
Stafford. Surface exposures
show good silver values and the
indications are that these gen
tlemen have located an excellent
silver property.
One very interesting and pe
culiar feature is that the gangue
or vein filling is largely barite
(barium sulphate) which appar
ently "carries" the silver values.
This means that it will pay any
one who has a barite, deposit
upon their property to investi
gate it for silver possibilities.
A number of prominent min
ing companies were represented
in this district this week, among
them being Mr. Heron of the
famous Tigre Mining Company
of Sonora, Mexico.
At this time there is a demand
for silver properties or good
silver prospects. The silver
content of ores in this district
has been largely overlooked:
lead and copper has been sought
after, and when these lead or
copper ores had a silver content
it was cot appreciated. Now, with
the price of silver high and lead
and copper low every one should
seriously prospect for silver
not only for new ore bodies, but
old stopes and workings should
be explored for their silver pos
sibilities. A. P. Gross, one of the large
northern iron mining operators,
recently in the district wires
that he is now ready to develop
two of the properties examined
by his engineer. He will soon
start work upon the American
Boy property, owned by Messrs.
Clarke, Petersen and Scheler,
and the Deep Down property,
owned by John Costello.
Gray Brothers have given a
lease to Ricardo Zazueta and
Aurena Rivera, on the Roanoke
and Papago claims of the Col
licello group. On the former
claim a vein was recently un
covered which is reported to
a.ssay 1.6 ounces in gold, 53
ounces silver and 65.12 per cent
lead. The Papago is a copper,
gold-and silver proposition. The
leasers are now sinking a winze
in the tunnel on the Roanoke
and expect soon to be shipping
oie regularly.
The Collicello group ' adjoins
the Arizona-European property
on the south, and is only a mile
from the Three R mine. W. D.
Gray, one of the owners of this
property, is enthusiastic over
recent discoveries and is sure it
will soon develop into a real
mine.
Prank Reichert, in from the
Alto district Monday, makes the
statement that McGinley and
Smith of the McGinley Mining
Company are busy with develop
ment work, at present being
engaged in driving the lower
tunnel on the Trudy and expect
to strike the main vein within
the next 10 feet. This company
has just completed 100 feet of
tunnel and shortly expect to
contract for a 200-foot extension
on the same work. The Trudy
is a silver property. Develop
ment work is also going forward
on the Bland, owned by the same
company. "Black Jack" Garden
is manager of the McGinley in
terests. Mr. Reichert also states the
camp is anxiously awaiting news
from the Grund Brothers of St.
Louis, who are expected to take
over all of the Baca Float in
terests. If this deal is consum
mated it will mean big things
for the Alto district.
Bracey Curtis, president of the
First National Bank of Nogales,"
who is interested with E. E.
Bethel in the Chief property,
adjoining the famous World's
Fair, in company with Mr. Be
thel visited the property Sunday
last. A decision was reached to
at once employ a force of men
and begin development work on
the Chief on quite an extensive
scale. It is the intention of
those interested in this property
to sink a deep shaft. A. H.
Glidewell will be in charge of
the work.
George W. Peirce, superinten
dent oi the Hardshell mine, ac
companied by his son, Gowen
Peirce, motored to Tucson Tues
day, where they remained a
couple of days in the interest of
the Hardshell Mining Company.
While in Tucson they consulted
with the engineer of the Amer
ican Smelting and Refining Co.
in regard to the purchase of
more machinery for the Hard
shell. E. E. Bethel of the Washing
ton Trading Company, one of
the most enthusiastic supporters
of the mining business of the
Patagonia district, is a busy man
these days looking after his
various interests. Mr. Bethell
makes the statement that the
outlook for tbe surrounding
country in a mining way never
looked hr ijrbter"than at present,
and wit.) the coming of new cap
ital into the country and new
properties being opened up, Pa
tagonia must of necessity pros
per during- the coming season
as never before.
RED CROSS WORKERS NEEDED.
The Red Cross needs more
trained Home Service Workers
in small towns as well as in the
cities.
A limited number of students
can still be admitted to the 4th
San Francisco Red Cross Insti
tute of Home Service, wljich
opened March 24th. This is a
six weeks intensive course in
social work.
Preference is given to those
students who are recommended
by their local Chapters. but
others will be admitted as far as
there is room. a
The course consists.of lectures
by experts at the State Univer
sity and of practice work under
expert supervision. Applica
tions will be reeeived by the
Red Cross at room 357, Flood
Building, San Francisco.
GET CREDIT ON HOMESTEADS
Soldiers and sailors who serv
ed in the world war will be en
couraged to take up homestead
land by the department of the
interior. Notice has just been
received at the local land office
that a law has beeu passed by
which returned service men will
receive credit on any homestead
or other filings they may make
in the future for all the time
during which they were in mili
tary service. The law passed
some time ago in this connection
only gave credit for service to
those men who had made appli
cation for homestead entry pre
vious to their entering the army,
navy or other branch of military
service. Messenger.
JUAN CABRAL GETS TWO YEARS
In the district court at Tucson
last Saturday, General Juan
Cabral. Sonora revolutionary
leader, entered a plea of guilty
in the district court to the charge
of conspiring with others to ex
port munitions of war to Mexico,
and was sentenced to serve two
years in the Leavenworth, Kan
sas, prison and pay a line of
$10,000. Federico Piatt, former
ly prefect of the district of Can
anea, Sonora, co conspirator with
Cabral and others, was sentenc
ed to a year and a day in the
Leavenworth prison. He was
shown marcy by the court be
cause of the reputation that,
while he was a Mexican official,
he was considerate in his treat
ment of Americans.

week will be the Czechoslovak
band, a musical organization
from the plucky little land ofij
Bohemia, which aided the Allies
so ably in the great world war.

their appearances on those cir
cuits, indicate that they are a
remarkable group of musicians.
They will give two full concerts
in Nogales on May 8.
The entire program will be
stronger than ever before, and
to help put it over no pains or
expense will be spared.

ARIZONA NOTES.
Items of Interest Culled From Our
Exchanges.
Arizona leads every state in
the union in paying up its pled
ges in the united war work
campaign with 96 per cent of all
subscriptions in. This statement
was made today by Director S.
E. Lind. It was further an
nounced that the department of
Arizona being the southern,
comprising Arizona, New Mex
ico, Texas, Oklahoma, Arkansas
and Louisiana, leads all others
in paying its pledges.
More than 274,000 acres of
land have been returned to vari
ous Mexican communities by
President Carranza, acting un
der the new constitution or the
republic and executive decree.
President Carranza has author
ity to restore the land to former
owners or make outright grants
to new claimants. In the Feb
ruary -list it was'noted that of
eighty two tracts returned only
nine were by restoration.
Col. Charles Harris, state ad
jutant general today denied the
report that he was considering
launching suit against Governor
Campbell for stopping money
allotments to the military de
partment. The colonel said he
had legal advice that by so do
ing the Governor had laid him
self open to a charge under the
penal code, '"but," continued the
adjutant general, "that is a mat
ter for the attorney general and
not for me."
Land withdrawn from home
stead entry recently in northern
Arizona near Fredonia and not
far from the Utah boundary, has
just been restored to entry ac
cording to information recently
received at the Phoenix land
office. The land was withdrawn
temporarily pending survey and
classification. This having been
accomplished the land is now
again open . to entry. The land
consists of one township, but
out of this there have been taken
a townsite and a number of
homestead, settlements.
George AMacdonald of the
state land department, held a
land sale at the Court House
yesterday in which more than
thirty thousand acres of land
lying along the Gila river in the
eastern part of this county was
sold to the public, says the
Yuma Sun. This is the second
land sale within the month at
this place and in toto more than
130,000 acres of state lands has
been disposed of. When the
big project is put in on'the Gila
near the Maricopa line the land
which is now being sold will be
very valuable, and the land pur
chasers of today will lind that
their money has increased many
fold. E. D. MILLER . Editor and Prop.

HARVEY'S MINSTRELS COMING.
With "Spareribs" Jones, "Slim
Jim" Austin, "Snowball" Elliott
and "Nervous" Cannon and
"Sleepy Eyed" Whitmore the
comedy of Harvey's greater min
strels would be superior to other
similar shows without Clarence
Powell, Ed. Tolliver and Frank
Kirk. After all there cannot be
too much comedy in a minstrel,
provided" of course it is the clean
cut and irresistible kind.
Manager Harvey is justly proud
of all the talent he has secured
and although it is expensive to
pay high salaries" to so many
clever people, yet it is a lot of
satisfaction to the manager to
feel assured that no matter
where the Harvey greater min
strels plays, it is going to please
the patrons.,
.However none of the above
coterie of experts are funnier
than Frank Kirk as" he is play
ing his banjo and singing with
a lighted cigar in his lips, that
he apparently swallows the cigar
and continues to sing s smoke
pours forth from his mouth like
lava from a volcano.
Kirk's performance is clever
but likewise is the woik of
Alonzo Moore, the man of much
mystery, the Wbitraores in their
dancing number and the Means
couple in their classy but strange
work of surprising stunts.
The popularity of the minstrel
form of entertainment will never
die out as long as such com
panies as the Harvey minstrels
of forty really taLented people
provide entertainment they do
in the- manner they do and for
the popular prices they do. A
noon day parade is made daily,
the wardrobe for the men and
women far exceeding anything
ever worn in a similar parade.
This company will be at the
Lyric theatre Friday and Satur
day, April 4 and 5, with a pop
ular price matinee Saturday.
THE HOME BUILDER.
In another place there appears
the financial statemente made to
the Bank Comptroller by the
Nogales Building & Loan Asso
ciation at the close of business
on March 4 last, say the Oasis.
The showing made by the
splendid institution does not run
up into an imposing array of
figures, as does, that of other
financial institutions, for the
reason that the capital stock is
cancelled and withdrawn as it
matures: but the value represent
ed by the matured and cancelled
stock has become a comfortable
home, or handsome building that
is useful tohe owner and orna
mental to Irogales. Within the
twenty-six years that the Noga
les Building & Loan Association
has been in existence and opera
tion there have been many good
substantial buildings erected as
a result of its beneficent m
lldence, and many families now
live in comfortable and attractive
homes that have been built under
the building and loan association
plan from money that otherwise
would have been expended in
rents, without the owners having
anything to show for the cash.

STORAGE DAMS NEEDED.
There are yet several zood i0
cations on the rivers of Arizona
for the construction of storage
dams to conserve the surface
water supply in the " Gila and
San Pedro rivers and prevent it
from running unused to the se
in flood time.
The dam at San Carlos on the
Gila was suggested to be the
first one to be constructed under
the government reclamation act,
but those who favored the dam
at Roosevelt got the first, appro
priation. Another available site
on the Gila river is at Guthrie
between Duncan and Solomon
ville and where the Morenci
Southern Railway connects with
the Arizona and New Mexico
line, ten miles from Clifton. On
the San Pedro river at Charles
ton, this county, is an excellent
site for a storage dam which if
erected would impound enough
water, during the winter season
to reclaim and supply with water
for irrigation many thousands of
acres of fertile land between
Charleston and where the San
Pedro goes into the Gila.
The people of Arizona should
use every effort to push these
projects to the attention of con
gress with the purpose of hav
ing the work started as early as
possible. Sun.

pleased to learn that there is at least
one dreaded disease that science has
been able to cure in all its stages, and
that is catarrh. Catarrh being greatly

giving the patient strength by building
up the constitution and assisting na

they otter One Hundred Dollars for any
case that it fails to cure. Bend for list
of testimonials.
