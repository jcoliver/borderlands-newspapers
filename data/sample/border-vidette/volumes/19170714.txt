The nation-wide hunt of the
past two or three years for a
domestic supply of potash has
been rewarded by a discovery
of importance, and as in the case
of many other valuable deposits,
the find was made in Arizona.
The deposit lies in a valley or
basin, a out thirty miles above
Parker, on the Colorado river.
Potash enters largely into the
manufacture of explosives and
munitions of war, and at present
the demand far exceeds the sup

It is reported that the drift on
the 200-foot level of the Arizona

breaking into ore stringers, in
dicating that a large ore body
will soon be uncovered. Owing
to the nature of the formation
the miners are only breaking
about four feet daily in two shifts
All of the drift at this point
must be timbered. It is thought
as the drift progresses the forma

that the timbering can be elim-

President Chailes Moyer of the

The Miners' Loyalty league has

BUREAU OF MINES.
Course in First Aid August 6th.
and 8th, at U. of A.
7th,
The demand has come so heavi
ly for Opportunity to get first
aid training that the Arizona
State Bureau of Mines will give
an intensive course in First Aid
on August Oth, 7th and 8th at the
University of Arizona at Tuc
son. This work is practically re
quired of all men who are enter
ing the government service
either as officers or enlisted men
and the takiug of such training
in advance is of great assistance
to these men. Tne recent call
for men to enter the fall Officers
training camp requires that the
men have such a course although
there is little opportunity for the
men to get it before the call to
camp comes on August 27th.
First Aid has been playing a
very important part during the
past year in the training of men
for war service although it has
been of great service for many
years in industrial organization.
The time is coming shortly when
every man employed in what are
called hazardous occupations
will be required to show certifi
cates of proficiency in first aid to
the injured.
The entrance of the Reserve
Officers Training Corps into so
many of the colleges of the Unit
ed States and the fact that First
Aid is among the required sub
jects shrows a great many stud
ents deficient and unable to re
cei ve the benefits offered by the
Reserve Officers Training Corps
and this course being given by
the State Bureau of Mines at
this time will allow many of
these students to make up that
deficiency.
The course is open to all men
over 18 years of age and there
are no requirements except the
ability to understand the English
language.
There is no charge for the
course and it is probable that
special rates will be made for
those desiring to take the course,
at Tucson hotels and rooming
houses.
The work will be under the
direction of S. C. Dickinson,
Safety Engineer of the Arizona
State Bureau of Mines who has
been doing this work with the
United States Bureau of Mines
for several years.
The work should prove ex
tremely pepular for never has
the need of first aid training
been so pronounced as at the
present time. Further particu
lars relative to the course may
be obtained from Charles F.
Willis, Director of the Arizona
State Bureau of Mines, Tucson.
Through the courtesy of M.
J. Kingsbury, superintendent of
the Southern Pacific of Mexico,
with headquarters at Empalme,
who for many years has been a
member of the American Asso
ciation of Railroad Superinten
dents, we publish the following
communication which will be of
interest to many readers of The
Border Vidette:
"At the meeting of the Ex
ecutive and Advisory Committee
of The American Association of
Railroad Superintendents held
at Room 300 Union Station, St.
Louis, Mo., June 3rd, 1917, the
loliowing action was taken:
"Since the meeting of the Ex
ecutive and Advisory Committee
on December 8th, 1916, when
Minneapolis, Minnesota, was
selected for the 1917 annual
meeting to be held August 8th,
9th, and 10th, our Nation has
become involved in a great war
to vindicate the principles of
peace and justice in the life of
the world, as against selfish and
autocratic power. This fight for
the liberty and self government
of all people has brought us face
to face with a situation in which
thoughts of industrial advance
ment must be secondary to suc
cess in the war, and where all
conceptions of self advantage,
personal interest and even of
life itself, must be subordinat
ed. It was pointed out that a num
ber of associations, in the inter
est of conservation of transpor
tation; energy and forces, have
indefinitely postponed their 1917
annual meeting. Therefore, af
ter mature consideration of the
matter, the following resolution
prevailed :
Whereas, this Nation has
become involved in a conflict
for the defense of democracy,
which means the right' of those
who 5;ubmit to authority to have
a voice in their own government.
and,
Whereas, we are confronted
by perhaps one of the gravest
situations ever imperiling a free
people, rendering it necessary
that the transportation forces
be conserved in all directions,
. Resolved, that this Associa
tion, pledging as it does its loyal
ty and support to the Govern
ment in defense of liberty, just
ice, and humanity, also offers its
service to the President of the
United States in whatever man
ner he sees fit to use it, and,
Resolved Further, that the
annual meeting at Minneapolis,
Minnesota, which was to be held
on August 8th, 9th, and 10th,
1917, be indefinitely postponed."

An incident happened at a

which goes greatly to the credit
of a Yuma Indian. The Indian
came to the home with some
water melons and asked the lady
which one she wanted. She
selected a fine melon, thinking
she was going to purchase it.
"How much V" she asked. "Me no
take pay," came the retort.
"Last winter you give me bread
and coffee." The lady then re
membered that one cold day last
December an Indian, none other

something to eat, when she gave
him a cup of coffee and some
bread. A finer sense of gratitude

Life
Was a
Misery
Mrs. F. M. Jones, of
Palmer, Okla., writes:
"From the lime 1 en
tered into womanhood
... 1 looked with dread
from one month to the
next. 1 suffered with my
back and bearing-down
p?.ia, until life to me was
a misery. I would think
1 could not endure the
pain any longer, and 1
gradually got worse. . .
Nothing seemed to help
me until, one day, . . .
I decided to
TAKE
The Woman's Tonic
" I took four bottles,"
Mrs. Jones goes on to
say, "and was not only
greatly relieved, but can
truthfully say that I have
not a pain. . .
"It has now been two
years since I tooUCardui,
and 1 am still in good
health. . . I would ad
vise any woman or girl
to use Cardui who is a
sufferer from any female
trouble."
If you suffer pain caused
from womanly trouble, or
if you feel the need of a
good strengthening tonic
to build up yourrun-down
system, take the advice
of Mrs. Jones. Try Car
dui. It helped her. We
believe it wiH help you.

Miss O'Daley His Interesting Night
Classes.
One of the most marked indica
tions of progress shown by our
foreign neighbors is the interest
they are taking in the English
language. Three months ago
Father Von Goethen, upon the
requests of his parishioners,
started a class for men, women
and children. The position of
instructor was given to Miss
O'Daley, a woman of great abil
ity who has devoted much of her
life to the mastery of the mo
dern languages. Aside from the
regular class in English. Miss
O'Daley has many English
speaking students who are learn
ing Spanish, French or German.
Originally the class was to have
been in two sections, one for the
men and one for the women who
desired to learn. Owing to un
avoidable circumstances, namely
the impossibility of securing the
services of a second instructor,
Miss O'Daley unselfishly took
the responsibility of both sec
tions and at present the class
contains 30 members. Herald.

WHEAT BRINGS $3.62 1-2.
Probably the highest price
ever received by an Arizona
grower for wheat was that paid
this week to John Hendricks of
this place by the Mesa Milling
Company, $3.62 per hundred
for a carload of choice milling
wheat. Mr. Hendricks sold all
of his crop of wheat with the ex
ception of the carload at $3.60
per hundred. Mr. Hendricks
took particular pains witlj, his
wheat crop while it was growing
and had men out in the field
pulling the weeds, not permitt
ing auy of them to ripen, which
accounts for the high price paid
by the milling company.
Mr. Hendricks harvested 1,
292 sacks of wheat from 80 acres.
Prom 80 acres of barley 1,000
sacks were harvested. In all he
had in 400 acres of wheat and
barley and harvested 4,650 sacks
of graiu. This is by far the best
crop yield yet reported this sea
son. Mr. Hendricks farms in
the Kenilworth district. All
harvested with Deering combin
ed harvester in 31 days. Flor
