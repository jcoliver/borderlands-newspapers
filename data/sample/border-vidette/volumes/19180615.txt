George W. Harben, assisted
by Judge George H. Crosby, of
St. Johns, is engaged in ab
stractiDg the titles to 80 tracts
of land, which are to share in
the loan to complete the Lyman
dam project in Apache county.
When this work is completed
the state treasurer will turn over
the sum of $320, 0C0 which the
state will advance as a loan for
the completion of the project.
An important financial trans
action in connection with a ship
ment of 862 head of cattle occur
red at Benson on Wednesday in
which respect for the acumen of
P. H. Meyer, a callow youth of
about 26 years was developed in
the minds of a Tucson firm of
cattle brokers, the sellers of the
cattle. The cattle train was de
layed at Benson while Mr. Meyer
wrote out a check for $20,000 in
favor of the Serranos.
Within a mile of Benson there
has been completed a roadway
bridge that for substantialness
and artistic construction will
take rank with the best of such
public improvements in the state.
The bridge spans the San Pedro
river a short distance east of
town on the Benson - Willcox
highway traversing the county
from this place to the New Mex
ico boundary. The bridge is of
reinforced concrete and has been
constructed at a cost exceeding
$26,000.
Under a new agreement the
army will handle all mail for the
expeditionary forces after it
leaves United States ports. The
post' office department will de
liver the mail to military author
ities at the port of embarkation
in this country and receive it
from them at a port in France
for dispatch to the United States.
The domestic money order ser
vice to the troops will for the
present at least, continue under
the diiection of the post office
department in France.
The resolution of Senator Ma
honey, bringing together Ariz
ona and Utah on a bridge across
the Colorado river near Scanlon's
ferry, is beginning to take effect.
C. W. Lynch, of the board of
supervisors, has received notice
from the governor of Utah that
a meeting will be held at St.
George for the purpose of dis
cussing the subject of the bridge
with the people of southern
Utah and Mohave county, whom
the bridge would greatly benefit.
Of course nothing can be done
at this session of the legislature
or congress, but when the new
legislative bodies meet in Utah
and Arizona matters will have
come to a head and progress can
be made.
DOUGLAS COPPER OUTPUT.
The production of copper in
the two Douglas smelters during
the month of May amounted to
a total of 24,170,000 lbs., divided
as follows: Copper Queen 16,
142,000 pounds; Calumet & Ari
zona 8,028,600 pounds. This
shows that the mining industry
in this section is about normal.
The figures include all custom
business received from mines,
other than those of the Warren
district.
The Old Dominion at Globe
produced 3,239,000 pounds.
The Humboldt smelter, oper
ated by the Consolidated Arizona
Smelting company produced 2,
000,000 pounds of the red metal.
GET RIGHT MEN.
It is about time the cattlemen
paid close attention to who goes
to the next legislature. It would
also be a good idea to keep a
weather eye on the governor
ship. The mining companies
want the cattlemen taxed more
heavily and they will try to get
into office, the people who will
attend to the business for them.
The cattlemen are strong enough
to put in anyone they want; and
all they have to do is to get to
gether and vote as a unit. Cat
tlemen have never played pol
itics, as cattlemen, but it is time
they start in as a matter of pro
tection. Cattleman.
While it is appreciated that in
parts of Arizona Spanish neces
sarily must be used to a large
extent, the Council of Defense
finds food for thought in a late
proclamation by Governor Hard
ing of Iowa. It recites that Eng
lish is the official language of
the United States and of the
state. There is a guarantee that
every individual may worship
God according to the dictates of
his own conscience, "but this
guaranty does not protect him
in the use of foreign language
when he can as well express his
thoughts in English, nor entitle
the person who cannot speak or
understand the English lan
guage to employ a foreign lan
guage when to do so tends, in
time of national peril, to create
discord among the citizens or to
disturbe the peace and quiet of
the community."
"Every person," the governor
writes, should appreciate and
observe his duty to refrain from
all acts or conversation which
may excite suspicion or produce
strife among the people, but in
his relation the public should so
demean himself that every word
and act will manifest his loyalty
to his country and his solemn
purpose to aid in achieving vic
tory for our army and navy and
the permanent peace of the
world."
So the governor gives out a
few war time rules that Eng
lish must be the only medium
of instruction in public, private,
denominational or other similar
so.hools; conversation (especially
directed against Germany) on
trains, in public places or over
the telephone, should be in Eng
lish, including church services.
PATRIOTIC WIFE.
It sometimes happens that a
man overestimates his own im
portance, which was evidently
the case of a Bozeman, Mont.,
man of draft age, who presented
the following letter to the Gal
latin county exemption board:
' Dear United States Army
My husband ask me to write a
reckomend that tie supports his
family. He can not read, so
don't tell him. Just take him.
He aint no good to me. He aint
done nothing but drink lemmen
essence and play a fiddle since I
married him, eight years ago,
and I gotta feed seven kids of
hisn. Maybe you can get him
to carry a gun. He's good on
squirrels and eatin. Take him
and welcurn. I need the grub
and his bed for the kids. Dont
tell him this, but take him."
What Did You Do in the War.
A Chicago paper has asked of
every American, What are you
doing to help win the war? Are
you going ahead as usual, intent
on your own personal interests,
quieting your conscience by say
ing. The government has nt
called me?' But your country
called you the day war was de
clared. The defense of your
country is identical with the de
fense of your home. The attack
of the German army is identical
with the attack of thugs against
your home, your wife, your
daughter. Are you going to let
your neighbors defend your
home without any assistance
from you? Are you that kind
of a selfish coward who lets
some one else fight his battles
for him? When the war is over,
will you change the subject
when some one asks, 'What war
work did you do? Will you then
have your self respect or will
you live ashamed of yourself
and despised by your fellow
men? Will you be honorably
accepted by or dishonorably dis
charged from Society? If you
cannot serve in the army or
navy, you can help in some
other department. There is
plenty of work for everyone, in
cluding YOU."

A meeting was held Sunday
night in the Wilson building, in
Patagonia, to select committees
and lay plans for the Fourth of
July picnic to be held unuer the
auspices of the Red Cross or
ganization for the residents of
the entire county. The program
to be arranged will be an elabor
ate one, and every effort will bo
made to make the day one of
patriotism and pleasure.
A committee from Nogales met
with the local committee Thurs
day evening to arrange for co
operative effort on our next In
dependence Day. Other resi
dents of the county in outlying
districts also will be asked to
help make the picnic a success
by their effort and attendance.
The picnic will not be a Pata
gonia affair, although held in
the beautiful grove on the So
noita grant; but is to be a coun
ty day, and no other arrange
ments should be made for that
day.
Barbecued beef and other re
freshments will be plentifully
supplied, and sports will be ar
ranged so the time will not hang
heavily upon your hands. Pa
triotic addresses will be made,
and a general spirit of patrio
tism will be in the atmosphere.
Patagonia is ideally located
for an affair of this kind, being
about the center of the county
and easily accessible from all
points. There is plenty of good
water and shade, and the hos
pitality of the Patagonians is a
well known quality of genuine
ness. Patagonian.
FREE LEGAL ADVICE.
All men who are subject to
duty in the National Army
should assume that they will be
called upon to serve, and should
take time to properly arrange
their business affairs so tiiat
after they leave their home they
will have nothing to worry about.
The national government and
the state of Arizona have pro
vided several measures fcr the
protection of the men who enter
the army. Every man should
thoroughly understand these
measures. There are legal pap
ers that should be made out be
fore leaving; if one has prop
erty, arrangements should be
made to protect it.
All the lawyers of Santa Cruz
county have volunteered their
services to give free legal ad
vice to every man about to en
ter the National Army. It should
be the duty of every man to talk
his affairs over with a lawyer so
that by no chance will he leave
his affairs in disorder.
The army wants you, when
you enter its service, to be free
in mind to give your military
duties full attention, and does
not want you to have home wor
ries to distract your mind. You
will have nothing to worry
about in a business way if you
will take care in arranging your
affairs before leaving.

gust. Bumpless Roads of the Future.
Those of us who ride in auto
mobiles, and that means nearly
everyone, are interested in good
roads, particularly those that
are smooth.
Extensive tests recently com
pleted in the laboratories of the
Standard Oil Company have
opened the probability of a
bright future of bumpless roads.
In the past oiled roads have
had a decided tendency to break
down in places and become very
uneven after a short time. The
trouble was that earlier road
oils contained only a percentage
of asphaltum. The tests of the
Standard Oil Company have
proved that asphaltum offers
many times greater resistance to
the forces of traffic and the ele
ments than road oil containing
only a percentage of asphaltum.
Engineers are recognizing this
fact and are using Calol Asphal
tum (E grade) in their opera
tions. The result is that the
bumpless road, instead of being
a total stranger to the motorist,
is becoming a well known friend.

tered into womanhood
... 1 looked with dread
from one month to the
next. I suffered with my
back and bearing-down
pain, until life to me was
a misery. I would think
I could not endure the
pain any longer, and 1
gradually got worse. . .
Nothing seemed to help
me until, one day. . . .
1 decided to
TAKE
The Woman's Tonic
"1 took four bottles,"
Mrs. Jones goes on to
say, "and was not cr.ly
greatly relieved, but can
truthfully say that 1 have
not a pain. . .
' It has now been two
years since 1 tookCardui,
and I am still in good
health. . . I would ad
vise any woman or girl
to use Cardui who is a
sufferer from any female
trouble."
If you suffer pain caused
from womanly trouble, or
if you feel the need of a
good strengthening tonic
to build up your run-down
system, take the advice
of Mrs. Jones. Try Car
dui. It helped her. We
believe it wttl help you.

TIME
E
Now is the time to learn how to ccok in comfort all the year round
the time to buy a New Perfection Oil Cook Stove.
An oil cook stove assures that your kitchen will stay cool even in the
hottest summer weather, because the heat of the stove is concentrated
on the cooking.
There is no smoke or odor ; no dust or dirt. And you have all the con
venience of gas. Lights at the touch of a match and heats in a jiffy.
More convenient than coal or wood. Better and more economical cook
ing all the year round. O
The week after next will be New Perfection Oil Cook Stove Week.
Look for the Big Blue Discs in your dealer's window. Go in and ask
about oil cook stove comfort and convenience. -:
