States Steel corporation strikes
no uncertain note. At a time
when hesitatitioD and timidity
characterize the general attitude
of business men, it is pleasant
to read his confident assertion
that this country is "in an era
of prosperity undreamed of."
"What we need to do," he says,
"is simply to get to work and
not talk about unemployed.
Pessimistic talk will do more to
bring about unemployment than
it will to prevent it. As for the

TO ALL LOYAL AMERICANS.
The following letter of, ad
vice from the Arizona War Sav
ings Committee to citizens of
the State who have purchased
Liberty Bonds, is worthy of the
deepest consideration:
"If you have not sold and do
not intend to sell any of your
Liberty Bonds, this letter is not
intended for you.
"If you have sold or contem
plate selling any of your Liberty
Bonds, read and study this fetter
corefully, then put your Liberty
Bonds in a safe place and KEEP
THEM.
"Speaking recently on the
subject of the selling df Liberty
Bonds, which has been taking
place, the Secretary of the U.S.
Treasury, said :
'Our boys at the front in the
service of their government
have never quit. If you sell
your Liberty Bond, you quit at
a time when the government
needs your continued suppoitf.
Every time you quit by selling
your Liberty Bonds, you hurt
the credit of your government
and make it more difficult to
finance the war. The cost of
the war continues until peace is
signed, and our gallant boys are
brought back to American soil.
"We wish to urge upon every
one of you not to sell your Lib
erty ouuua unuei any cuuuuj-
stances. If you are. without food
or are about to be dispossessed
from your home, then is the time
to consider borrowing money on
your bonds, but not until then.
"This also applies to War
Savings Certificate Stamps and
Thrift Stamps. Do not sell
either. ,
"Always remember that if the
boys who sailed from this coun
try for Prance, after arriving in
Prance had turned and come
home without fighting, we would
not be talking about holding
Liberty Bonds, but would pro
bably be getting together all we
own in the world, each and
every one of us, for the purpose
of handing it over to the kaiser
in the form of taxes.
"If Liberty Bonds sell at less
than par on the Exchanges, it is
simply because a lot of people
are dumping them on the market
instead of holding them as they
should do. These bonds will
eventually sell at par or above,
and your money is safer in them
than it would be in any other in
vestment. "If in the future, the roll is
called for holders of Liberty
Bonds, be sure you have your
badge of honor in the. form of
your original Liberty Bonds."

FOR EASTERN READERS.
For the benefit of our many
readers outside of Santa Cruz,
county who have never had the
pleasure of visiting this particu
lar section and, by the way,
they are scattered from Cali
fornia to Maine and from Cana
da to the Mexican border we
want to say that Patagona is
beautifully located in the Sonoi
ta Valley, between the Santa
Rita and Patagonia mountains,
says the Santa Cruz Patagonian.
The latter range, a short dis
tance east, of town, rises to a
height of 2000 feet above the
valley and, being heavily tim
bered, forms a background un
surpassed for beauty. To the
west are the Santa Ritas, which
culminate in Old Baldy at an
elevation of 9423 feet. These
mountains are also well forested.
The elevation of Patagonia is
4053 feet, the climate arid, with
warm summers and-mud winters.
Owing to the dryness of the at
mosphere, cool nights and a
more or less constant breeze the
summer weather is not unpleas
ant, while the winters are un
surpassed anywhere in the
country. A more healthful all
the year around climate would
be difficult to find.
Patagonia offers inducements
to home-seekers in the way of
reasonably priced lots and acre
age adjoining the townsite.
Think it over, you of the
show-bound East; wouldn't you
like to own a home in this land
of perpetual sunshine in this
land of opportunity?
RECLAMATION BOOM BEGINS.
A recent dispatch from Phoe

days an Arizona delegation will
leave for Washington to lay be
fore Secretary of the Interior
Franklin W. Lane, a concrete
proposal to place returned sol
diers and sailors and other set
tlers on reclaimed lands in this
state. This announcement, made
by leaders in the movement fol
lowing a meeting of the Phoe
nix Rotary club, marks the com
pletion of the plans for what is
said to bethe greatest reclama
tion project in the history of
the state.
George H. Maxwell, credited
with being the father of Ari
zona's largest irrigation projects;
Andrew Kimball, Arizona repre
sentative of the agriculture de
partment of the railroad admin
istration, and Frank Olmstead,
reclamation engineer of Los An
geles, have brought almost to
completion the draft of a plan
which will place half a million
acres at the disposal of new set
tlers. The meeting also marked the
anniversary of the passage, six
teen years ago, of the national
reclamation act, in speaking of
which Mr. Maxwell said:
"The Roosevelt dam cost $10,
000,000. It made possible the
development of the Salt River
valley and in that valley the cot
ton crop of last year was valued
at $14,000,000. This is a final
answer to the question, does re

AMERICANS WELL ENTERTAINED
Nogales Boosters in Mexico Treated
Like Brothers.
The following story from Ma
zatlan, Sinaloa, Mexico, wired
to the Nogales Daily Herald, will
be of interest to readers of The
Border. Vidette, throughout
the United States, who are in
terested in the southern repub
lic: Mazatlas, Feb. 25: At no
point along the line have the No
gales Chamber of Commerce ex
cursionists been more royally
welcomed as they were welcom
ed here .last night. Governor
Iturbeof Sinaloa met the special
train at Culiacan yesterday, and
officially welcomed the excur
sionists to the state and to the
capital.
The train arrived here yester
day afternoon, and never has a
train load of people been wel
comed with more sincerity than
was the special bearing the
Chamber of Commerce boosters.
Literally thousands of people
were gathered at the depot as
the train pulled in and the noise
of the cheering people and the
music of the several bands that
were gathered together, was so
intense that one could hardly
think.
All of the inhabitants it seem
ed, turned out to greet the Am
erican business men and on
every side could be heard "Viva
Los Americano?." It appears
that the people of this section
have been eagerly waiting for
days the arrival of the trade
boosters, and everyone in the
town seemed to be glad to have
the Americans in the town.
As soon as the excursionists
left the train,. Bracey Curtis,
president of the Chamber of
Commeree, was met by the pre
sident of the town, and he and
the governor, in the name of the
state of Sinaloa and the munici
pality of Mazatlan, welcomed
the visitors.
At night the
were the guests of
at a banquet and
the state capitoi.
excursionists
the governor
ball given id
This was un
of the finest
questionably one
affairs that has ever been iven
in this section of the West Coast.
The banquet was an interna
tional affair. Governor Iturbe
and other prominent men of Sin
aloa addressed the excursionists,
welcoming them to Mexico, and
said the trip was the beginning
of a new era of prosperity for
the two countries. The gover
nor emphasized the fact that
such excursions could do noth
ing less than react for the mu
tual benefit of the people of
Mazatlan, Sinaloa, the West
Coast of Mexico, and for the
people of Nogales, Arizona. He
told the excursionists he was
glad to meet them as friends,
glad to know them as business
men, and added that he hoped
the friendship thus begun would
continue. )
Frank Barry made an address
for the vilitors, in which he
thanked the governor for .the
kind words of welcome, and said
that he was assured that the
people of Nogales, x Arizona,
were eager and anxious to know
the people of Mazatlan, Sinaloa,
better and he was assured that
the people of the northern city
would be glad to welcome a dele
gation from Mazatlan.
Everybody in Mazatlan enter
ed into the spirit of the meeting,
and those residents in the south
ern city all expressed the keen
est appreciation for the visit
from the Chamber of Commerce,
and all the party are satisfied
that the welcome in Mazatlan is
an expression of the feelings all
along the west coast.
The party spent Monday in
Culiacan where they were ten
dered a reception and dance.
The reception was most cordial
and everyone of the excursion
ists will start back tomorrow
feeling that their list of friend
has grown.
According to the present plans
of the excursionists the special
train will leave Mazatlan early
tomorrow morning. Several stops
will be made on the return trip,
and they should arrive in No

THIS TELLS HOW TO
FIGURE INCOME TAX
Squarely Up to Every Individual
to Get Busy by March 15
or Suffer Penalty.
"Don't wnit until tlie final im date,
March 15th, for paying your Income
Tax and making your return. Avoid
the last minute rush. Any person can
figure out his liability today as well as
he can next week, and if there Is any
point on which he needs advice he can
now get in touch with a Ilevenue man."
This word of advice Is from Alfred
Franklin, Collector of Internal Reve
nue, 1'hoenlx, Ariz., who is collecting
the Income Tax In Arizona and New
Mexico. -Collector Franklin Is giving
without charge every aid of his ofllce
I and his enlarged field force to help the
people get their payments and their
returns in hy March 15th.
But the Income Tax men will not
pull your door-bell or your coat-talla,
according to the Collector's announce
ment. It is squarely up to every Indi
vidual to figure out his own case and
to get busy If he comes within the
scope of the new Revenue law.
Did You Earn Thla Much f
Every unmarried person who receiv
ed Income averaging $19.25 a week
during 1D1S and every married couple
who Jointly received Income averaging
$38.50 a week should seCure at once
from-the nearest Deputy Collector or
the nearest bank a blank Form 1040 A.
That form contains the Information he
will need to enable him to figure his
correct net Income and any tax that he
owes the Government.
The law requires that every unmar
ried person who had a net income of
$1,000 or over and every married per
son whose net Income wns $2,000 or
over (Including the income of husband
or wife, and the earnings of minor
children, If any) must make a return
on or before March 15th. And this re
quirement does not hinge on whether
the person owes n tax.
Taxable Income.
An Individual must Include under
gross Income all gains, profits and In
come derived from salaries, wages, or
compensation for personal service of
whatever kind and In whatever form
paid, or from professions, vocations,
business, sales or dealings in property
of all kinds. Interest, rent, dividends,
or profits derived from any source
whatever. Very few Items of income
are exempt.
Deductions include ordinary and nec
essary business expenses. Interest paid
or accrued on Indebtedness, taxes of
all kinds except' Federal Income and
excess profits taxes and assessments
for local benefits, losses actually sus
tained, debts ascertained to be worth
less, and depreciation on buildings, ma
chinery, fixtures, etc.- used In business.
A further deduction Is allowed for con
tributions to corporations operated for
religious, charitable, scientific or edu
cational purposes or for the prevention
of cruelty to children or animals to an
amount not exceeding 13 per cent of
the taxpayer's net Income as computed
without the benefit of the contribution
deduction.
The taxpayer is not allowed to de
duct any personal, living or family ex
pense, any amount spent for improving
property, or any exiense of restoring
property or making good its exhaus
tion for which an allowance is claimed
under depreciation.
Figuring the Tax.
Before figuring the normal tax the
dividends are deducted as credits from
net Income, together with the personal
exemption. As In previous years, divi
dends of domestic corporations are ex
empt from . normal tax when received
bj" the stockholder.
The normal tax rates for citizens
and residents are as follows: On the
first $4,000 of net income In excess of
the credits the rate Is G per cent ; on
any further taxable income the rate Is
12 per cent. .
The surtax rates apply to net In
come of each Individual In excess of
$5,000. The personal exemption and
the dividends are not deductible before
computing surtax. In the case of re
turns by husband and wife, the net
income of each Is considered separate
ly in computing any surtax that may
be due. Form 1040 should be used for
making returns of net income exceed
ing $5,000, and the instructions on that
form will show how to figure the sur
tax. Business House Returns.
Employers and others who paid
wages, salaries, rents, interest or sim
ilar determinable gains In an amount
of $1,000 or over during 1918 to any
person must file an information return
with the Government. Blanks may be
secured from the Collector.
Every partnership must file a return
showing Its Income and deductions and
the name and address of each partner,
with his shnre of the profits or losses
during the past year. Personal service
corporations will file similar informa
tion for 1918.
INCOME TAX PAYS
FOR PUBLIC BENEFITS
"Viewed In Its largest and
truest sense, the payment of
taxes Is payment for benefits
received or expected. Only from
a narrow and essentially selfish
and shortsighted viewpoint can
the individual propose to himr
self the evasion of tax liability
as a desirable course of action."

er of Interna Revenue.

Internal Revenue Bureau
Has Every Available
Officer in Field.
SEVERE PENALTIES IF, YOU
DELAY BEYOND MARCH 15
Willi the lue (lute for Income Taxes
only a few week away, the collection
of this f u r- re a eh 1 1 1 g tax on 11)18 In
come's lias started off with a bang.
Everybody Is figuring income tax.
Payment and sworn statements of
income must reacli Internal Revenue
offices on or before March lf, anil there
are severe penalties for delinquency.
Residents of New Mexico and Ari
zona are required to make their rei
turns and pay their taxes to Alfred
Franklin, Collector of Internal Reve
nue, Phoenix, Ariz., or to any of his
deputy collectors who are now doing
free advisory work on Income Tax.
"Pay your Incon.e Tax by March
15," Is the slogan of the Internal Reve
nue Bureau, which lias sent every
available officer into the field to help
the public to understand the require
ments and to prepare the returns.
Who Must Make Return.
It Is estimated ttmt many thousands
of single and married .persons in this
section of the United States who have
never before made annual returns are
required to do so this year.
Income tax returns must be made
between now and March 15 by persons
who come under the following classifi
cations :
Any unmairlcd person whose 1918
net Income was $1,000 or over. Wid
ows and widowers, divorcees and mar
ried persons who are living apart from
their husbands or wives, tire for the
purposes of the Income Tax classed
as unmarried.
Any married person living with wife
or husband whose 1918 net income was
$2,000 or over. Ti e Income of both
husband and wife must lie considered,
together with the earnings of minor
children, if any.
Revenue Bureau Offers Aid.
Each person in the United States
who Is In either of these classifications
must get lutsy at once If penalties are
to be avoided. He should secure a
blank Form 1040 A for reporting net
Income up to $5,000, or Form 1040 If
his net Income exceeded that amount.
Forms are being distributed by Collec
tors and their Deputies, also by banks.
By following the instructions on the
forms a correct return can be prepared
at home. If a person needs advice or
aid, the Deputy Collectors In the field
will furnish this without charge.
The new Revenue law places the In
come Tax duty on citizens and resi
dents. Tlie Internal Revenue Bureau
Is sending It3 men to work right with
the public to get the tax and the re
turns In. With active co-operation,
every tax due March 15 will be paid
and every return required by law will
be In the Revenue offices on time.
Exemptions Allowed.
A single person Is allowed a personal
exemption of $1,000. If he is support
ing In his household relatives who are
dependent upon him; he may claim the
status of the head of a family who has
the same exemption as If married.
A married person, who lives with
wife or husband, is allowed a personal
exemption of $2,000. The head of a
family Is entitled to claim a similar
personal exemption.
An additional exemption of $200 is
allowed for each person under eighteen
or iucapnble of self support, who was
dependent upon and received his chief
support from the taxpayer.
A husband and wife living together
ore entitled to but one personal ex
emption of $2,000. If they make sep
arate returns, the exemption may be
claimed by either or divided.
Accuracy Required.
Absolute accuracy is necessary In
making up income figures. Any per
son .who is working for wages should
find out exactly how much he received
during the whole year 1918. Fees,
bank interest, bond interest, dividends,
rents received,, and all other Items
must be reported- correctly. Mere
guesses are not accepted, for they are
unjust alike to the taxpayer and the
Oovernment, and defeat the proper ad
ministration of the law.
"The payment of Income taxes
takes on a new significance
which should be understood by
every citizen. The taxation sys
tem of this country is truly pop
ular, of the people, by the peo
ple and for the people. Every
citizen is liable to tax, ami the
am. unit of the tax is graduated
according to the success and for
tune attained by each individual
In availing himself of the oppor
tunities created and preserved
by our free institutions. The
method and degree of the tax is
determined by no favored class,
but by the representatives of the
people. The proceeds of the tax
should be regarded as a national
Investment," Daniel C. Roper,
Commissioner ou Internal Reve
nue. :

CONDITIONS BETTER IN MEXICO
Wearied witli continued dissen
sion, the policy of the Mexican
government is undergoing a
change that bids fair to bring
about peace in our sifter repub
lie, says The Messenger.
Claims for indemnity present
ed by the United States govern
rnent ar now under considera
tion by the Mexican congress
and oppressive measures in the
oil region are receiving attention
with a view of fair settlement.
The Mexican government has
returned to their owners more
than a thousand properties, con
fiscated immediately after the
revolution, which resulted in
Carranza's coming into power.
The list of restored properties,
as received in Washington.shows
that with a single exception only
Mexicans or Mexican companies
have been favored. The excep
tion was the PVench company,
El Boleo, which operates mines
in Lower California.
One of the most significant
features of these restorations,
officials here said, is that many
former supporters of Diaa and
Huerta and even ro.yalis.ts are in
the list. This is taken to mean
that Carranza is intending to
placate the various factions op
posed to him. In the list is a
Russian who became a Mexican
by naturalization, and who, ac
cording to officials here, was one
of the most active agents of
Huerta in getting arms and am
munition into Mexico to supply
the Huerta army.
Others whose properties have
been restored include:
Olegario Molina, governor of
Yucatan under the Diaz admin
istration, who now lives in Cuba;
Emilio Rabasa, former governor
of Chiapas, deputy and senator
who has made his home in New
York since his flight from Mex
ico; Rafael Reyes Spindola, edi
tor El Imparcial, a government
organ under the Diaz regime,
who fled from Mexico and has
lived in New Orleans since Diaz
was overthrown; and Enrique
Mondragon, general in the for
mpr Mpxinan federal armv. who
was forced to leave the country
by the Madero government and
has been in Cuba and Spain
since then.

MORNING GLORY DEVELOPING
The Southern Arizona Mining
and Smelting Company, of which
E. R. Shaw is vice president and
general manager, is doing con
siderable work on the Morning
Glory mine in the way of devel
opment, at present being engag
ed in cross cutting.
The Morning Glory is one and
one-quarter miles- west of the
Mowry mine, on the- north side
of a shallow gulch that drains
nortwest into Alum Gulchat an
elevation of about 5,600 feet.
The deposit was discovered in
the late eighties by David Neal,
who, with A. S. Henderson, took
out considerable silver ore.
Later the property was aban
doned, to be relocated in 1895 by
Richard Farrell, from whom it
was acquired in 1908 by C. B.
Wilson, who at present is heavi
ly interested in the property.
A consideiable part of the ore
is said to yield about 17 per cent
copper and 15 ounces to the ton
in silver. Patagonian.
