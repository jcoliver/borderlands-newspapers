Interesting News Items Clipped From
the Patagonian.
John Hoy has recovered from
his recent illness and was in
Mexico this week looking after
his mining interests.
Prank Reichert was in Pata
gonia last Monday from Alto
and reported mining conditions
in his section as improving.
The Rhea Mining Company,
with property near Patagonia, is
now cutting a station on the 230
foot level, from which point the
company will run a drift.
Gus Holmes of Pittsburg, Pa.,
a mining engineer, and Mr. Cairo
of Phoenix, interested in mining
property in the Salero district,
were in Patagonia early in the
week.
Tuesday's freight brought in a
car of mining timbers for the
Layman Syndicate, to be used at
the Blue Nose mine, and a cai
of oil for the Hardshell Mining
company.
Richard Roe, Chester and Er
nest Brodine spent Sunday in
Patagonia, coming down from
Jefferson Camp, where they are
developing the Golden Rose, a
promising silver property.
Wednesday morning Charles
Mead took out a large load of
supplies, consisting of tools, ore
cars, powder, etc., to the Eureka
mine on the Baca Float, now
being worked by Ferguson &
Collie. '
The last load of machinery for
the American Boy was hauled
out to the mine Wednesday by
Rafael Amado. A 12 horse team
was necessary to handle the
heavy hoist, which weighed sev
eral tons.
George F. Wieland, mining
man of Jefferson Uamp, is build
ing a new cottage on the rear of
his property on Main street in
Patagonia. The new home will
later be occupied by Mr. Wieland
and family.
The Layman Syndicate, oper
ating the Blue Nose mine under
the direction of B. B. Smith, has
finished cleaning out the old
works and is now drifting on the
160 foot level. The outlook is
encouraging.
The building of Gardner Hall,
suspended some time ago on ac
count of a shortage of material,
was resumed Tuesday morning
and it is expected the new place
of amusement will be completed
within a short time.
The brick cottage belonging
to Ed. Hainline is rapidly near-
ng completion. This week Geo.
N. Curtis is building . the flues
and finishing the masonry work.
It is understood this property
has already been leased for a
long term.
H. H. McCutchan has been
busy during the week hauling
umber and supplies to the Hosey
mine, now being developed Dy
Eastern capital. The machinery
has been installed at the new
shaft and sinking will now pro
ceed without interruption.
Sam Parent, one of the own
ers, and u. J. renner, leaser on
the Twentieth Century property
n the Santa Ritas, were in town
Monday after supplies. They
brought in some fine looking ore
and report that their ground is
rapidly developing into a real
mine.
The San Rafael valley, one of
the beauty spots of Southeastern
Arizona, will this year produce
enormous crops 01 corn, beans,
maize, sorghum and other pro
duce. The rains have been
abundant in this section and the
farmers and cattlemen are en
thusiastic over the present out
look, since the promise is lor fat
cattle and abundant yields to the
tillers of the soil.
It is reported that arrange
ments are practically completed
which assures the erection of a
mill in the Santa Ritas by the
Bland Mining company. It is
reported there has been $20,000
worth of development work done
on the Bland property and that
enough milling ore has been
blocked out to justify the erec"
tion of a mill to handle it in an
economical manner.
There is net a vacant house
for Vent in Patagonia. On the
other hand there are several
families in town who are anxious
to rent homes and become per
manent residents of the best
town in the Southwest. This is
a condition that exists in few
placts in the country. The
growth of the town justifies the
erection of more substantial cot
tages which could be rented for
normal prices and thus increase
Patagonia's population and pros
perity. The Castle Butte mine, locat
ed two miles west of Patagonia
and owned by E. H. Evans and
James Keating, has been taken
under bond and lease by George
W. Pierce, who plans an exten
sive development campaign on
this well known and promising
property. Mr. Pierce is now in
Pasadena, Cal., where he will
make preliminary arrangements
for the contemplated work. The
Castle Butte is in the south end
of the Wrightsou district on a
tributary of Temporal Gulch. It
was first located in 1879 and
since that time has produced
considerable ore carrying good
values in copper and silver.
MEXICAN OIL WELLS.
It is not generally known that
the world's greatest oil wells to
day are located in Mexico.
One well that was producing
50,000 barrels of petroleum daily
for eight years has been closed
by flooding.
This well in measured capa
city turned out 120,000 barrels
crude oil per day in a steady
stream for eight years.
Another Mexican well at Cerro
Azul, brought in February 10,
1916, has a tested capacity of
310,000 barrels daily.
On 'Account of limited pipeline
it has been throttled down to a
flow of fifteen thousand barrels
per day.
While the English capitalists
have oil interested in Mexico,
America investments are sbill
larger.
The joint interests of our coun
try and Great Britain in oil sup
plies from Mexico make friendly
relations important.
Oil may be the means of allay
ing all troubles on the waters of
international strife between the
two republics.
MORE RAIN.
Heavy rains continue to fall
all over this section. Monday it
rained practically all day at Will
cox, throughout. the valley and
surrounding mountains. Reports
from every section confirms
that the rain has been general
and abundant. The cloudy
weather and continued heat pres
age a continuance of precipita
tion. The farmers have finer
crops than ever in the history of
this locality. The dry farmers
who depend upon the rains for
a crop have now the best show
ing for years, and the promise
of a great crop is indicated
everywhere. The grass in the
valley foothills and mountains is
in many places a foot high and
plenty of wild hay will be cut
this year. A great many cattle
were shipped out the last eigh
teen months and the ranges will
have a chauce to recuperate.
The future prospects for the
valley in every line of industry
has never been better. Willcox

DO IT THE SCIENTIFIC WAY.
County agricultural agent W.
W. Pickrell has issued an appeal
to the farmers and cattlemen of
Santa Cruz county for coopera
tion in improving agriculture
and stock raising. The fears of
old timers that the introduction
of scientific methods is largely
poppy cock should be dispersed
by the record of improvement in
other counties of Arizona and in
other states where scientific
farming is doing much towards
producing larger and better
crops on the same acreage and
to putting to use lands previous
ly lyiog idle.
Scientific farming means sim
ply the learning of facts devel
oped by other farmers who have
proven the facts by experience,
experiment, or by chance. The
science lies largely in assemb
ling proven knowledge and elim
inating disproven theories. The
same applies equally to scientific
cattle raising.
Agent Pickrell has establish
ed local headquarters with the
Chamber of Commerce in Noga
les and at the offices of the San
ta Cruz Patagonian. Request
for assistance may be left at
those places and will receive Mr.
Pickrell's attention. Local farm
ers and cattlemen are requested
also to lay before the agricultur
al agent any new or unusual
facts that come to their notice in
the pursuit oL their respective
professions. The agricultural
agents while disseminating
knowledge gained by their in
tensified training are also desir
ous of "learning as they teach."
A STEP FORWARD.
Announcement has been made
that the contracts for the land
under the projected San Carlos
diversion dam had been approv
ed by the Secretary of the In
terior, and a representative is
now on his way to Arizona to
have them signed. This simple
item spells water for 62,000 acres
in the lower Gila valley and
means the permanent establish
ment of another great irrigation
district for Arizona. -
For many years the claims of
the Indians and the white own
ers have clashed and no result
could be obtained. Last spring,
however, a ten day conference
was held in Los Angeles, Cal.,
between representatives of the
Indian Service, the Interior De
partment and the white settlers
of Florence and Casa Grande.
This resulted in a decision to
settle the differences of both
sides and to hasten the construc
tion of the much-needed diver
sion dam on the upper Gila. By
this settlement, the white set
tlers will receive water for 27,000
acres f land and the Indians
water for 35,000 acres.
Casa Grande, located some
eighty miles west of Tucson,
bids fair, with the impetus given
it by the construction of the
diversion dam, to become another
great farming center in Arizona.
It has land the richness of which
is unexcelled in any portion of
the country. Its cantaloupe crop
this season has proved the re
gion as a potential center for the
growth of this class of produce.
It has the advantage over Phoe
nix that it is located on the main
line of a great transcontinental
railroad. It has already gone
far. With water in abundance
it can go still further. Star.
LEGISLATIVE DISTRICTS.
The new law governing the
Legislative Districts of the va
rious counties of the state is
now effective and it is very likely
that the Cochise Hoard of Su
pervisors will take the necessary
steps at its next meeting to dis
trict the county since big danger
lurks in any failure to do so. If
the Board should overlook this
or any other board in the state
should do so, there would be no
legislative representation in the
legislature which convenes in
January 1921, since the mem
bers could not be elected under
the old method. The law is
plain and it is mandatory upon
the various Boards and this
matter should under no circum
stances be overlooked Prospector. She mxAtt Wx&cttt

Many thousands of
women suffering from
womanly trouble, have
been benefited by the use
of Cardui, the woman's
tonic, according to letters
we receive, similar to this
one from Mrs. Z. V. Spell,
of Hayne. N. C. "I could
not stand on my feet, and
just suffered terribly,"'
she says. "As my suf
fering was so great, and
he had tried other reme

get Cardui. . . I began
improving, and it cured
me. I know, and my
doctor knows, what Car

nerves and health were
about gone."

She writes further: ' I

can do my work. I feel I
owe it to Cardui, for I was
in dreadful condition."
If you are nervous, run
down and weak, or suffer
from headache, backache,
etc., every month, try
Cardui. Thousands of
women praise this medi
cine for the good it has
done them, and many
physicians who have used
Cardui successfully with
their women patients, for
years, endorse this medi
cine. Think what it means
to be in splendid health,
like Mrs. Spell. Give
Cardui a trial.

MAY BUY PATAGONIA MINES.
It was rumored in Nogales this
week, that Ed. Bush, manager
of the San Xavier Glance mines
and other properties situated in
the Twin Bnttes district, Pima
county, from which he realized
a large fortune, has taken over
the Three R mines in the Pata
gonia mountains owned by Col.
R. R. Richardson.
It is also reported that Mr.
Bush and associates are negotiat
ing for the purchase of the
Buena Vista, and other claims
owned by the Arizona European
Mining Company, of Nogales.
These claims, from which con
siderable ore has been mined,
adjoin the Three R on the south,
and if purchased by the Three
R people, will greatly enhance
the value of their property.
Ed. Bush, who visited Nogales
this week, is one of the best
known, most successful practical
mining men in the country. He
thoroughly understands the big
game, and his advent into the
Patagonia district, will be most
welcome. With sufficient capi
tal, the Buena Vista and other
claims owned by the Arizona
European Mining Company, can
soon be developed into a dividend-paying
proposition.
Mr. Bush has seen both the
Three R and Buena Vista prop
erties. He's not buying a pig in
a bag.

SEVERAL CROPS IN ONE YEAR
It is difficult to over estimate
the advantages which the climate
of Arizona possesses over that
of less favored regions when the
possibilities of truck gardening
in this state are considered. In
southern Arizona it is quite pos
sible to produce as many as
three, and sometimes four, good
revenue producing crops on the
same land in a period of twelve
months.
The following are some pro
fitable relations suggested by
Professor F. J. Crider, Horti
culturist of the Agricultural Ex
periment Station of the Univer
sity of Arizona:
Lettuce, planted in the fall
and off the ground in spring in
time to be followed by canta
loupes, which in the latter part
of July or first of August, may by
succeeded by corn for silage or
cowpeas. With this combina
tion it 13 not difficult to obtain a
profit of two to three hundred
dollars per acre with the added
advantage of being able to grow
a good cover crop.
Spinach, cabbage, or cauli
flower, all good money crops,
may be planted in the fall and
followed by early Irish potatoes
or string beans, which, in turn,
give place to a cover crop of
cowpeas or a late crop of me
lons. Other combinations may be
worked out to meet the require
meats of particular soils and
markets, and, with the use of
shorter season crops, the land
may be handled in such a way
that it is possible to produce as
many as four crops in the same
year.
