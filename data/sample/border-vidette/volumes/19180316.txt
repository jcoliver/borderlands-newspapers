ARIZONA NOTES.
Items of Interest Culled From Our
Exchanges.
Approximately five thousand
American Indiaas have enlisted
in the army for service against
Germany, according to a state
merit from the war department.
Also, the Iadians of the United
States have subscribed more
than nine million dollars to the
Liberty loans.
A Canadian order in council
provides for the free admission
into Canada of meat cattle until
February 7, 1919, when import
ed by bona fide residents of Can
ada under regulations by the
minister of customs. Cattle, ex
cept for breeding purposes, are
ordinarily dutiable at 32 per
cent. Packages containing dutiable
gifts sent to members of the
Expeditionary Forces temporari
ly serving in England will be
delivered free of duty, provided
the contents are bona ride gifts,
the Quantity is not beyond the
personal requirements of the ad
dressee, and that the parcels
are addressed for delivery to the
regimental address of the re
ci pient.
The people of Florence cer
tainly heeded our admonition to
"do their derndest" and went
away "over the top" in thrift
stamp sales in the big drive con
ducted last Saturday by the,
ladies and school children of
Florence when thrift stamps to
the amount of 1886.20 were
sold. And how the kiddies did
work. The old saying "worked
like beavers" wasn't in it with
the way those youngsters kept
you digging up the q-jarters.
The state health ofiicer has
ordered that every school child
in Arizona be vaccinated. This
will affect 4000 pupils in Phoe
nix and more than 10,000 in the
state. Each, child must show a
satisfactory scar or submit to
vaccination. A certificate from
a physician will not be accepted
as evidence. The penalty will
be expulsion from school. The
order is issued as a general
health requisite, as smallpox
prevails in various parts of the
state.
Arizona has reported to Pro
vost Marshal General Crowder
that the classification of regis
trants in this state is complete,
thus making what is expected to
be a record. That Arizona is
the first of all the states to com
plete the classification and will
be so announced in a few days,
is the prediction at the office of
the adjutant general. Only three
or four days ago, Colonel Harris
received notice from Washing
ton that no state had completed
the classification, and the state
ment carried the inference that
the work was far from being
completed.

Washington, where he and Mr.

were entirely successful. Mr.
Coker states that Messrs. Reed

that they will come to the Flor

vice. Patrons desiring long dis
tance connections with the above
named places will not have to
wait, as under the old system,
until El Paso, Bisbee, Douglas,
Nogales and other points are
cleared from the line. Some
times a heavy run of business

IMPORTANT.
The United States Govern
ment has again called upon the
State of Arizoca for assistance
and it is believed that the State
will respond as readily to this
call as it to all previous calls.
Tiie Arizona State Bureau of
Mines has been asked to gather
samples of light volcanic rocks
that are capable of developing
good strength. There are many
types of such rocks in the State,
such as visicular basalts, vol
canic tufa, valcanic ash, vol
canic scoria, the essential being
lightness combined with
strength. It is probable that the
porous lava flows will best
answer the purpose.
As this rock is to be used in
the manufacture of concrete
ships, it can be readily seen that
a large tonnage will be neces
sary, that it be situated close to
a railroad or within easy truck
ing distance.
Samples of rocks of this type
should be sent at once to the
Arizona State Bureau of Mines,
Tucson, Arizona, with some
description as to the extent of
the deposits, and proximity to
railroad, with information as to
whether a spur track could be
built.
The campaign to raise a sec
ond 100,000,000 has been an
nounced by the American Red
Cross for the week beginning
May 6. To date nearly 90.000,
000 has been appropriated for
war relief work.

A margin riot less than two

and white or in color; if jn color
not more than four different
colors should be used. One of
these colors must be the partic
ular blue to be noted on the W.
S. S. already in use. Not more

prevail. No name, word or
mark exclusive of the design it
self may appear on either the
face or back of the poster, ex
cept the designer's symbol, which
must appear only on the back
with letter (A) (B) or (C) to in
dicate the class entered. The
margin must be free from marks
of any kind. The identifying
symbol or word on the back of
the design must not contain the
initials of the designer.
The posters selected by com

to serve the purpose for which
they are intended, will be used
by the government in the thrift
campaign. Prizes for the best
posters are offered as follows:
Class A. First prize of 12
war savings certificates having
a value of 00.00.

In addition to the foregoing
awards and mentions, a national
jury will award a national prize
of honor, to consist of a ribbon.
The higest of all awards will
be given to a single individual
in each class, who is necessarily
a prize winner from one of the
groups. Thus the nation's
champions in poster designing
among school students will be
chosen.

The Spirit of Friendship.
This store looks upon its patrons not
merely as customers but as friends.
People purchase here because they
have friendly feeling for this store.
The cause which develops this friendly
feeling, may differ, in fact, they are
sure to differ. One's friendship for
the store is the result of rinding good
values; another's is the result of effi
cient service and courteous treatment,
and so on.
Naturally this friendshiply feeling on
the part of our patrons is reciprocated
on our part. And this spirit of mutual
friendship is an impetus for greater
service and an incentive to ever-increasing
endeavor to make this store
a place where every visitor will feel
perfectly at home.
