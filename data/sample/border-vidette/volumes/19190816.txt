COURTESY.
The Spirit of Friendship.
This store looks upon its patrons not
merely as customers but as friends.
People purchase here because they
have friendly feeling for this store.
The cause which develops this friendly
feeling, may differ, in fact, they are
sure to differ. One's friendship for
the store is the result of finding good
values; another's is the result of effi
. cient service and courteous treatment,
and so on.
Naturally this friendshiply feeling on
the part of our patrons is reciprocated
on our part. And this spirit of mutual
friendship is an impetus for greater
service and an incentive to ever-increasing
endeavor to make this store
a place where every visitor will feel
perfectly at home.

NO ASSESSMENT WORK IN 1919.
House Passes Joint Resolution Sus
pending Labor on Mining Claims.
Congressman Carl Hayden in
a recent letter to the press of
Arizona says:
"I am glad to advise you that
the house has passed a joint re
solution to suspend the require
ment of assessment work on
mining claims during the year
1919, which is the same as the
exemption granted by congress
in 1917 and 1918 except that this
new act provides "that no such
suspension shall be granted to
any one claimant for more than
five claims." The joint resolu
tion also applies to oil placer
locations, which was not the
case heretofore.
The full text of the resolution
reads as follows:
Resolved by the Senate and
House of Representatives of the
United States of America in Con
gress assembled. That the pro
vision of section 2324 of the Re
vised Statutes of the United
States which requires on each
mining claim located, and until
a patent has been issued there
fore, not less than 100 worth of
labor to be performed or im
provements aggregating such
amount to be made each year,
be, and the same is hereby, sus
pended during the calendar year
1919. Provided, That no such
suspension snail be granted to
any one claimant for more than
five claims: Provided, That
every claimant of any such min
ing claim in order to obtain the
benefits of this resolution shall
file or cause to be filed in the
office where the location notice
or certificate is recorded, on or
before December 31, 1919, a no
tice of his desire to hold said
mining claim under this resolu
tion.
"Sec. 2. That this resolution
shall not be construed to alter,
modify, amend, or repeal the
public resolution entitled 'Joint
resolution to relieve the owners
of mining claims who have been
mustered in the military or naval
service of the United States as
officers or enlisted men from per
forming assessment work during
the term of such service,' ap
proved July 17, 1917."
PAY OIL IS FOUND IN FOLDS
Along the sea coast are some
times found long stretches of
level strata of oil bearing sand,
but in all such cases the oil is
never in paying quantities.
It is rather a common belief
that oil occurs in great under
ground lakes, but this is far
from true, fpr it never does. Oil
in commercial quantities is al
ways found in strata of sand
ranging from a few feet to
several thousandVfeet in thick
ness. Oil is not usually found where
it is formed, but being lighter
than water it migrates to the
higher portions of the folded
statum or passes through other
layers until it reaches a layer of
sand that is. overtopped with im
pervious sandstone.
From the study of all existing
fields geologists have learned:
1. That oil and gas in com
mercial quantities always occurs
in the higher parts of these
folds.
2. That oil and gas are al
ways found in sandy or water
layed deposits of sand, sand
stone, limestone and shales.
3. That water is always pres
ent in the same stratum as oil,
but lower down.
4. That the oil bearing stra
tum has always a layer of sand,
limestone or shale above and
below it so hard and impenetra
ble that the oil cannot pass
through. Tucson Post.

SUPPORT LEAGUE OF NATIONS.
The Covenant of the League
of Nations will create a situation
which will at least greatly re
strict and lessen the chances of
war between nations. Disputes
between individuals are settled
by our courts and we assume as
a matter of course that no one
shall turn to physical force. The
present war has brougt before
mankind, more vividly than any
thing else in history, the folly
and waste and crime of war.
We see its terrible devastation;
we see its terrible suffering. All
civilized mankind will struggle
for years to come under the bur
dens of this war. With our ad
vance in education, with our
means of disseminating informa
tion, we certainly have reached
the point where public judgment
should support an understand
ing between nations that, tends
to throw up barries in the path
of forces gathering for war.
That the covenant of the Le
ague of Nations itself presents
a real constructive method which
undoubtedly will greatly tend to
restrict war must be admitted by
all. As such, all should give it
help and support.
Andrew J. Peters,
Mayor of Boston.
As a result of the co operation
of Judge A. C. Lockwood and
Sheriff Jas. McDonald, a dance
hall ban for girls under 18 years
of age, who go unaccompanied,
has been ordered, and both offi
cials have issued letters stating
their views on the matter,
the concensus of opinion being
that young girls who go to pub
lie dance halls unaccompanied
should be barred, owing to so
many delinquencies which have
arisen during the past few
months, accrdited to the public
dance. Tombstone Prospector.

State Report Shows Month of July
Wettest in Twenty-One Years
With one possible exception,
the month of November, 1905,
tast month was the wettest in
the twenty one years of records
kept by the weather bureau in
Phoenix. This became known
with the recent publication of
the bureau's regular crop and
range summary, which says:
"Complete returns from co
operative stations throughout
the state show how general and
abundant was the rainfall dur
ing July and how favorable a
month it was for stock and
ranges. Southern Pinal county
reports more than 11 inches
since July 1; Elgin, Santa Cruz
county, Williams, Coconino, 10.47
inches, while the average for 72
stations scattered over the state,
was 5.16 inches.
Reports for the week ending
August 4, show still further im
provement in stock and range
conditions which were already
better than normal. The ob
server at Pinto, Apache county,
states that cattle and ranges
have never been better; Pine-
dale, Navajo county, reports
cattle fattening. In both these
sections cattle suffered severely
last winter.
"A factor of some importance
is found in the lighter stocking
of the ranges this year, a con
dition which improves the pros
pect of good winter forage.
"Moderate to heavy rainfall
and below normal temperatures
have characterized the past
week. Crops generally over the
state have progressed well un
der these conditions, showing
normal development or better.
In dry farming sections the pros
pects are excellent. No mention
is made of damage from insect
pests. As a result of the heavy
rainfall, cotton grown in the
Salt River Valley has continued
to rank on heavy soils though
there has been little shedding.
Weeds also have become more
troublesome. On sandy soils
comprising perhaps one fourth
of the acreage the abundant rain
has been a decided advantage,"
PATAGONIA ANTIQUITIES.
Through the activity of Con
P. Cronin, state librarian, the
state will come into possession
of an interesting find in Patago
nia. Some workmen engaged in
making excavation for Col. R.
R. Richardson came upon a
a burial urn containing human
bones. Mr. Cronin heard of it
and, being an old friend of Col.
Richardson wrote him soliciting
the urn and its contents as a
contribution to the antiquities of
the state. A letter from Colonel
Richardson, said that the urn
had been sent.
Mr. Cronin is making an effort
in every direction to establish a
collection of these relics of the
prehistoric times before they are
all gone. For nearly a half cen
tury these articles have been
removed until the best are now
all gone or are in private collec
tions within the state. Gazette.
HEIGHT OF RED MOUNTAIN.
Robin Montgomery and R. O.
Swayze of the state engineering
party, on Sunday determined
the height of Red Mountain, one
of the high points of the Pata
gonia Range lying southeast of
town. The mountain was shown
to have an elevation of 6354 feet
above sea level, or 2301 feet
higher than the valley. Pata
gonian. The value of gold, silver, cop
per, lead and zinc mined in Ari
zona in 1918 was $202,134,880,
the greater part of which was
for copper, according to V. C.
Heikes of the United States
Geological Survey, department
of the interior. Arizona con
tinued to be the largest producer
of copper in the United States
and will probably maintain its
position in 1919, but with a
greatly reduced output during
the first six months, when cur
tailment of production followed
the reduction of the prices of
metal.

NOGALES STEPS FORWARD.
The city- fathers of Nogales
are working on a plan to change
from the town to the city, a
change which has been long
needed in the border metropolis.
There is not a city in the South
west that has witnessed a more
steady, prosperous growth than
has Nogales. Strategically
situated as it is, Nogales should,
and without doubt will, be the
largest port of entry on the
Mexican border. Wich the com
pletion of the S. P. de M. R. R.
to a connection with Mexico City,
thus eliminating the roundabout
journey now necessary to reach
the Mexican capital, exports
will increase many fold and No
gales will profit thereby.
One of the great advantages
of a change in government will
be the ability of the new govern
ment to proceed with the many
improvements that modern cities
are now making. Nogales has
need of paving in particular,
and other improvements, all of
which will be facilitated by new
clothes which the city
are preparing for her.-Star.
