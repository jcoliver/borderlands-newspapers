The Spirit of Friendship.
This store looks upon its patrons not
merely as customers but as friends.
People purchase here because they
have friendly feeling for this store.
The cause which develops this friendly
feeling, may differ, in fact, they are
sure to differ. One's friendship for
the store is the result of finding good
values: another's is the result of effi
cient service and courteous treatment,
and so on.
Naturally this friendshiply feeling on
the part of our patrons is reciprocated
on our part. And this spirit of mutual
friendship is an impetus for greater
service and an incentive to ever-increasing
endeavor to make this store
a place where every visitor will S.-s
perfectly at home.

Within a short time it is re
ported, work will be begun on
the construction of a barbed
wire fence along the boundary
line between Calexico and Mex
ican. On motion of Congressman
Carl Hayden, the bill to incor
porate the American Legion, was
amended in the House to include
Andrew P. Martin of Tucsod,
as one of the incorporators.
Harry Wheeler, former sheriff
of Cochise county, was bound
over at his own request, for trial
before the Superior Court, on a
charge of illegally deporting
citizens from Bisbee in 1817.
The Patagonian is informed
that material for derrick, etc.,
has been sent out by the San
Pedro Oil Company, and that
drilling will be in order within
a reasonably short time. Every
thing indicates that the company
is in apposition to push the pro
motion of this enterprise with
all reasonable haste.
Information has reached Phoe
nix recently to the disturbance
of many deserving democrats
that Hon. Mark A. Smith had
been slated for appointment for
federal judge under the pending
bill crrating an additional judi
cial district in Arizona. Almost
all other democrats, that is,
democrat lawyers, had been
mentioned in connection with
this appointment, except Mr.
Smith, who it was supposed
would round out his public ca
reer in the senate.
Bronze plaques will be award
ed the New Mexico and Arizona
counties through which the fast
est and second fastest time per
mile is made in the El Paso
Phoenix road race in November.
One plaque will be awarded to
the county through which the
automobile that registers the
fastest time per mile. The other
plaque will be awarded to the
county through which the auto
mobile making the second fast
est time per mile is run. Three
New Mexico and Arizona coun
ties will be .eligible for these
plaques. These are Dona Ana,
Luna and Pyramid counties in
New Mexico, and Cochise, Santa
Cruz, Pima, Pinal and Maricopa
in Arizona.
MAY YET BE ACCOMPLISHED.
Some time ago Col. Richard
son took up the matter of a land
ing field for bi planes at Pata
gonia. Efforts have not been
altogether fruitless. Several
places have been casually in
spected which would make good
fields. Col. Richardson is now
negotiating with Val Valenzuela
for a field, with hopes of sue
cess.
A landing place for bi planes
here would be of great benefit
to the town. Biplanes may, and
perhaps will, ply direct from
Tucson. The line will be of
special service to mine prospec
tors and others, and can but re
sult in giving our town and re
sources wider publicity, which
means more money invested
here. Patagonian.

THE JUNIOR RED CROSS
To the School Children of the
United States:
Two years ago, as President
of the United States and as
President of the American Red
Cross, I addressed to you a let
ter in which I advised you to en
roll in the newly organized Jun
ior Red Cross, and I explained
to you some of the ways in
which the Junior Red Cross
would help you to be useful to
your country and to the child
ren of those countries which
were associated with us in a
great war against a powerful
enemy. Millions of you did join
the Junior Red Cross and work
ed hard and what you did is
warmly appreciated by the
whole country.
Now, by the blessings of God
and through the faithful per
formance of duty by our soldiers
and sailors and soldiers and sail
ors of the countries by whose
side we fought, a great victory
has been won and the war is
over, but I am sure that you
wish to continue to be useful to
your country and to children less
fortunate than yourselves.
Therefore, I am writing to
you at the opening of the new
school year to advise you again
to join the Junior Red Cross,
which has planned a work for
peace times even larger and
more systematic than the work
done during the war.
The Junior Red Cross will in
struct you in ideals and habits
of service, will show you how to
be useful to your school, how to
aid the older people in your
community in their efforts to
promote the health and comfort
of the people among whom you
live, and how to help children
who are still suffering from the
effects of the great war in for
eign lands invaded by the
enemy.
The recent war was the great
est of all wars, not only because
more men and nations were en
gaged in it than in any other
war of history, but also because,
as a result of it, people have
seen a vision of a different kind
of world of the past, a woild In
which nations shall unite for
purposes of peace and good will
as they formerly united only for
war against an armed foe. In
working for the children of
other nations you will come to
understand them better and they
will understand and appreciate
you more.
Your education will not be
complete unless you learn how
to be good citizens, and the Jun
ior Red Cross plans to teach you
simple lessons of citizenship
through its organization and its
activities. It is your generation
which must carry on the work
of our generation at home and
abroad and you cannot begin too
soon to train your minds and
habits for this responsibility.
By doing what you can to make
happier the people of your own
neighborhood, your state, your
country and also the people of
other lands, you will make your
selves happier.
(Signed) Woodrow Wilson.
JUST A STORY.
The celebration of Diez y Seis,
which is the well known Mexi
can Independence Day, should
be more appreciated by Ameri
cans. Citizens of Mexico hold in
sacred commemoration the great
day when Maximiliano was
overthrown by Benito Juarez
and others. In the Palacio Na
cional (museum) Mexico City,
stand two carriages, one just be
hind the other. The one in
front is a beautiful thing, trim
med in gold. The other is just
a plain closed carriage. If you
would know the sacredness at
tached to the Mexican patriots,
take a seat in Palacio Nacional
and watch the natives pass
these carriages. Usually with a
sullen look or acowl they greet
the carriage of gold, which once
conveyed the usurping monarch,
Maximiliano. But the other
carriage, in which once rode
Benito Juarez, the patriot, is
saluted with uncovered head,
often with a bow, and sometimes
with a sign of the cross. All
day long this goes on, and sel
dom do you lind a native so
ignorant of the history of Diez
y Seis, or so forgetful as to pass
without saluting with uncovered
head the Carriage which convey
ed their hero of liberty, Benito
Juarez. Patagonian.
BOXES AT STATE FAIR.
A new policy has been adopt
ed by the state fair commission
this year in the sale of grand
stand boxes. Heretofore it has
been the plan to have all boxes
placed at a uniform price, and
raffled off, each applicant having
an even break for the choice se
lections. This year they will be graded
in price according to their de
sirability, and sold on the basis
of first come first served. The
boxes will be placed on sale at
10 o'clock Wednesday morning,
October 1, at the offices of the
state fair commission, located in
the basement of the Fleming
building under the Phoenix Na
tional Bank.
Under the new classification
the boxes will be priced at $33,
$30 and $25. Each box is equip-
ed with six seats and tickets
will include admission to the
grandstand, bqt not to the fair
grounds. They are good for the
entire six days of the fair.
In order that out of town pa
trons of the fair may be well
taken care of the commission
will reserve certain boxes to be
sold to guests.
No checks for reservations
will be accepted by mail ahead
of the date set.

WILL RAISE MERRY HECK.
The Arizona Corporation Com
mission, composed of Chairman
Amos A. Betts and Members
David F. Johnson and F. A.
Jones, held an interesting ses
sion in Nofjales last Monday,
and considered many applica
tions for permits to run taxicabs,
jitney lines, truck autos and
transfer lines in Nogales and
auto-stage lines between Noga
les and Tucson and Nogales and
Sisbee. In the matter of better
auto stage service between this
city and Tucson, after hearing
testimony, pro and con, the Com
mission held its decision in re
serve thirty days, and ordered
the two lines now running, to
render weekly reports, showing
each day's traffic, etc., upon
which a ruling will be reached.
The Young Men's Business
Association and the Nogales
Chamber of Commerce, insist
that Nogales is entitled to a bet
ter auto stage service, and pro
pose to raise merry heck, and
put a rock under, if they don't
get it.
"Better give Nogales, the best
town on the border, too much
auto stage service, than not
enough," say Nogales and Tuc
son business men.

ing from Washington, to the ef
fect that Senator Marcus A.
Smith has introduced a bill un
der the terms of which the
United States will pay to the
State of Arizona an annual
rental of two cents per acre for
all lands included in the forest
reserves.
If this measure becomes law,
the state will receive a consider
able revenue, amounting in all
to something Dear a quarter of a
million dollars annually, which
will be applied to the general
fund of the state.
It is Senator Smith's idea, as
explained by him to Senator C.
H. Rutherford on the occasion
of the lattei's recent visit to
Washington, the state is entitled
to this rental in view of the fact
that it is practically impossible
to locate homesteads within the
forest reserves. While the law
provides for the location of
strictly agricultual lands within
forest reserves, it has been
found in practice that the privil
ege is of little value as the for
estry department is naturally
averse to such locations as are
also the cattlemen who have
grazing privileges within the
forest limits.
It is understood that the mea
sure has strong support in the
committee and there is every
probability of its early enact
meat. Jerome News.

STOMACH TROUBLE
Mr. Marion Holcomb, of Nancy, Ky., says: "For quite
a long while I suffered with stomach trouble. I would
have pains and a heavy feeling after my meals, a most
disagreeable taste in my mouth. If I ate anything with
butter, oil r grease, I would spit it up. I began to have
regular sick headache. I had used pills and tablets, but
after a course of these, I would be constipated. It just
seemed to tear my stomach all up. I found they were
no good at all for my trouble. I heard
THEDFORD'S
recommended very highly, so began to use it. It cured
me. I keep it in the house all the time. It is the best
liver medicine made. I do not have sick headache or
stomach trouble any more." Black-Draught acts on
the jaded liver and helps it to do its important work of
throwing out waste materials and poisons from the sys
tem. This medicine should be in every household for
use in time of need. Get a package today. If you feel
