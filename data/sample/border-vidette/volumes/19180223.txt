Another of the members of the

has been called to war service.
Professor C. A. Turrell, profes

head of that department, has
been appointed a member of the
Advisory Committee to the Com

of that committee.
Every man who has been sent
from the United States to do
overseas duty has been supplied
with a full Red Cross outfit.
For this reason, Red Cross head
quarters asks that persons do
not send knitted garments direct
to the men. All contributions
should be sent to the Red Cross.
This will eliminate confusion and
duplication, and make knitted
garments go further by proper
and careful distribution.
George W. Barnes, formerly
live-stock specialist of the Uni

extension service, and well
known to the Mesa farmers, has
resigned his position to engage
in the cattle business in Navajo
county. With him will be asso
ciated L. L. Botes, now super
intendent of the dry farm ex
periment station of the Univer
sity at Prescott, who will give
up his present position within a
few months to engage in this
private enterprise.
Every man, woman, and child
in this country, who wants to
serve theJcountry, can serve it
and serve it in a very simple
and effective way, Secretary
McAdoo says. That service is
to lend your money to the Gov

ed to the Government is a help
at this time and practically
every man, woman, and child by
making some trifling sacrifice,
some denial of a pleasure, or
giving up some indulgence, can
render the Government that sup

Prominent Pioneer Elected to Board
of Historical Society.
James G. Colter, father of
Hon. Fred. T. Colter, state sen
ator and democratic national
committeeman, has recently been
elected vice president of the
Pioneer's Historical Society, at
Prescott. Probably no other of
our pioneers enjoys the promin
ence and wide acquaintance in
all sections of Arizona, as does
Mr. Colter of A pao.be county.
Crossing the plains from Wis
consin in the early seventies, he
introduced the first reaper and
threshing machine in the state.
As many of our older readers
know, northern Arizona, and
particularly that part which is
now Apache county, was not
then the settled, peaceful com
munity one finds today. Where
prosperous farms, numerous irri
gation projects, well stocked
ranges, orchards and thriving
towns now greet the visitor,
were then the hunting grounds
of roving, desperate bands of
Apaches. Savages under the
leadership of Chiefs Geronimo
and Victoria periodically attack
ed the whice settlers, either kill
ing or driving away most of
their cattle and horses. Of those
who came to build their homes
in this new country, numbers of
them met their death in these
Indian raids, James G. Colter
himself being wounded. With
splendid health and vigor, Mr.
Colter, Sr., is truly seventy five
years "young," is very active,
and his feats in the saddle still
arouse the envy of even the
younger generation. Of late
years his time is divided be
tween Prescott and Phoenix,
spending the summers in the
nortbern city. His jovial, mag
netic personality has made
friends whom he numbers by the
thousands, and who never lack
for real entertainment when,
with his wonderful store of
knowledge and tales of frontier
life, they can strike this pleas
ant old pioneer in a reminescent
mood.
State Loans Money in Santa Cruz.
The state of Arizona at last
has acted favorably upon the
applications for loans made by
Santa Cruz County's farmers.
The good news comes at a time
when the money will do the
most good. At this time of the
year plowing and planting is be
ing planned and cattle may be
bought for less money than later
when the cattle are in good con
dition. The Patagonian is in receipt
of a letter from State Treasurer
David F. Johnson, which states
that in all seventeen loans were
approved, totaling $30,350 in
Santa Cruz county.
The money will be forthcom
ing as soon as the applicants
furnish the state treasurer with
satisfactory abstracts of title.
The state took a step in the
right direction when it adopted
the act permitting the borrow
ing of state funds by the farm
ers or tne state, as the short
time loans from the banks were
hard at times to meet when due
owing to the fact that the farm
er does not realize on his crops
but once a year, and he was
compelled to renew his notes or
pay them at the end of six
months, and other securities was
required than a mortgage on his
land.
We believe the benefit to the
farmers will be felt at this time,
when the country needs all the
foodstuffs that can be produced.
By giving the farmer money to
make improvements, buy ma
chinery and stock, he is enabled
to clo moie work and raise more
crops than he otherwise would
be able to produce. Patagonian
The initial step in the estab
lishmentof permanent highways
for Maricopa county was taken
Monday when petitions for the
appointment of an advisory high
way commission and for the
calling of a special election to
vote on a $2,000,000 bond issue
for good roads, were submitted
to the board of supervisors.

Sanitariums for the treatment
of soldiers suffering from tuber
culosis, are to be established at
New Haven, Conn., and at Fort
Whipple, Prescott, Arizona, in
addition to those to be built at
Asheville, N. C, and Denver,
Colorado, says a dispatch from
Washington.
It is understood that they will
cost about $550,000 each.
Whipple Barracks lies about
two miles south of Prescott, the
line of the Santa Fe, Prescott
and Phoenix railroad running
through the reservation. These
barracks are intimately connect
ed with the history of Arizona,
having been constructed in 1864
and were the headquarters of
General Cook during his Indian
campaign in this state.
The barracks consist of sev
eral massive stone barracks and
more than a dozen handsome
and substantial officers' quarters.
A station and postofiice were lo
cated on the grounds. The last
troops to occupy the barracks
were removed about eight years
ago, since which time the
grounds and buildings have been
in charge of a caretaker.
ENLIST IN THE ENGINEERS.
The man who boasts red blood
today has fight in bis eye and if
he is keen and spirited as well,
he has something else in mind
be has adventure. The one
branch of the service that em
bodies all that is adventurous,
inventive and skillful, is the en
gineer corps. Working cheer
fully under any difficulty, put
ting over with relish the jobs
that the other man calls im
possible, injecting "pep" into
everything tackled, and, when
the call comes for a fight, let
ting loose the stored up ardor
that has made the branch fam
ous since wars were known
that's the real manhood the
real "engineer."
The 31th regiment of engi
neers at Camp Fremont, Calior
nia, is a new organization in
name only, for its backbone is
taken from the old 3rd regiment
serving until lately in Hawaii.
There they made a record of
daring and accomplishment that
would fill the heart of a fiction
writer with self pity. They
turned out surveys under almost
impossible conditions, left the
other branches in the dust on
hikes and athletics, and withal
filled themselves with health,
manliness and clean fun. These
men are receiving their reward
in promotions to fill a few of the
many non commissioned berths
open in the new organization.
Under officers who have heart
and soul in the game, they are
now training for an early chance
to match Yankee brains which
they typify with the soulless
thing called "kuJtur." Any man
who thinks that he has the ne
cessary qualifications may apply
to Major J. A. Dorst, room 1U12
Santa Fe Bldg., San Francisco.
FIFTY FIFTY BASIS.
Important rulings by the food
administration at Washington,
affecting consumers, bakeries
and eating places in the observ
ance of the new wheat conser
vation rules, have been received
by the federal food administrator
for Arizona.
The official list of authorized
substitutes for wheat flour, to
be purchased by the consumer
on the fifty fifty basis, has been
extended to include not only
milo maize and feterita but all
grain sorghum flours and meals
This is a matter in which the
extension service of the Univer
sity of Arizona has been vitally
interested and the new ruling
should greatly stimulate the pro
duction of substitutes peculiarly
adaptable to the wheat conser
vation program in this state, it
is pointed out.
Victory bread, which is defin
ed to mean bread containing
twenty per cent or more of sub
stitutes for wheat Hour, should
not be sold at a higher price than
white bread.
Half Million Dollars Will
at Prescott.
TO EXPEDITE COURT BUSINESS
Senator Henry F. Ashurst of
Arizona has obtained quick ac
tion on his measure to establish
another federal court in Arizona.
The suggestion was made only
recently and already the senator
has had his bill passed by the
senate. With this good start,
the new court may be considered
almost as good as established.
The principal benefit is not
merely to relieve Arizona's one
overworked fefleral judge, W.
H. Sawtelle, but to expedite the
court's business in the interest
of the public and to effect a sav
ing of time and money. It is es
timated that the saving of money
now paid out for caring for pris
oners over periods of months
until the court can consider their
cases would go far toward pay
ing the cost of another court.
For instance, the court labors
through a session at Tucson and
goes thence to Globe. Prison
ers have been accumulating at
Globe, Phoenix and Prescott,
while the court has been in ses
sion at Tucson. They will have
been held at the government's
expense a long time before the
court reaches Phoenix and Pres
cott and by the time the Pres
cott docket has been cleared, it
is found that a number of pris
oners have been held a long time
at Tucson.
The saving of traveling ex
pense for the judge, officers of
the court and witnesses will be a
very important item. It is 200
miles from Tucson to Globe and
497 miles from Globe to Pres
cott. By dividing the state into
two districts, with one court
holding sessions at Tucson and
Globe and the other at Phoenix
and Prescott, court business will
be greatly expedited, long dock
ets cleared and the total cost to
the government made little if
any greater than it is at present.

REGULATION OF EXPORTS.
Wo. T. Haley, special agent
for the War Trade Board, with
headquarters at Nogales, has
received the following circular
from the War Trade Board,
which will be of interest to those
desiring export licenses:
The War Trade Board has
announced that the ruling under
which the exportation of food
grains, flour, butter and sugar
might be licensed by collectors
of customs at points of exit,
when the quantities shipped
were less than 125 bushels of
food grains, 25 barrels of flour,
12a pounds of butter, and 25
barrels of sugar, has been re
scinded and withdrawn. In or
der, however, to provide for the
needs of those persons in con
tiguous countries who have be
come dependent upon the United
States for their daily sustenance
the board has authorized the
collectors of customs, in their
discretion, to license the expor
tation of small quantities of
foodstuffs and feedstuffs, when
such exportation involves mere
ly frontier traffic on a small
scale by persons living near the
border, such as that arising out
of customary retail purchases
for their own needs."

'SOME FISH.
Frolic Arrives at Port of Guaymas
With Two Toms and Halt
Monday night A. IvI. Conard,
president of the Sonora Con
solidated Mining & Smelting
Company, accompanied by Fred.
Alford, mine sup3rinlendent,and
Mr. Grant Mills, a well known
capitalist from Tillamook,
Oregon, returned from a ten
day's visit in the south country,
which included a fishing excur
sion to the historic Tiburon
Island, near Guaymas, the bay
city.
The delightful sail from Guay
mas to the Island and return,
was made on the "Frolic," for
merly a famous pleasure boat of
Portland, Oregon, now owned
by the Pacific Coast Fishing and
Canning Company, of which Mr.
Conard is president.
The gentlemen report having
had a glorius time, not with
standing the fact that "Com
modore" Conard got sea sick,
and "Admiral" Mills failed to
bag a big buck deer.
After being out a couple of
days, the "Frolic" returned to
Guaymas bringing with her tspo
and one half tons of tine fish,
several of which measured seven
and one half feet. In order to
convince doubting: Toms, at
home, "Admiral" Mills had
"Commodore" Conard of the
good ship "Frolic," take a
number of pictures of the enor
mous catch, which in the
language of "Admiral" Mills,
was some fish.
When in Guaymas, the Conard
party stopped at Hotel Albin,
where they were royally enter
tained by Mine Host Willoughby,
the Irish consul at .the bay city.
Consul Willoughby took his
guests to a grand ball, where
they were shown every courtesy
by the civil and military author
ities, who made them feel at
home.
On the return trip to the
States, the fishermen stopped
several days at the ranch home
of Mr. and Mrs. I. E. Bowers,
near Noria, where they inspect
ed a big tract of land in which
they are interested. They also
visited the camp of the Sonora
Consolidated Mining & Smelting
Company, where Superintendent
Alford is arranging to resume
operations in the Cobre Grande
mine.
Tuesday afternoon Messrs.
Conard and Mills departed for
Los Angeles, from where the
latter gentleman will go to his
home in Oregon. He promised to
return next June, at which time
he intends to take another shot
at that Tiburon buck, or one like
him.
Mr. Conard, who now resides
in Los Aogeles, will return to
Noria in about ten days.
JOE TEMPLE ON THE JOB.
H. J. Temple, general super
intendent of the Southern Pacific
of Mexico, whose headquarters
are at Empalme, after spending
several days here on company
business, departed for the south
this morning, his private car
"Sonora," being attached to
the Guaymas train. Super
intsndent Temple was accom
panied by Mrs. Temple, a most
estimable lady, who has many
friends in Nogales. During the
many years of internal strife in
Mexico, Joe Temple has been
constantly on the job, . many
times where bullets tired by the
warring factions, endangered his
-life. He has taken chances few
men occupying his high position
would have taken, and his cool
ness and splendid judgment on
several occasions, prevented
great loss of life and Company
property in Sonora, especially
when Pancho Villa and his devils
invaded that state.

K. OF C. WAR FUND.
The Nogales Council Is Starting Big
Drive for Money.
The Nogales Council of the
Knights of Columbus is starting
a drive for the purpose of rais
ing funds for war purposes of
that organization and while their
appeal will be principally to
Catholics there is no reason why
non Catholics and those of other
denominations should not con
tribute to this fund should they
be so inclined. A quota of $650
was assigned to the Morales
Knights of Colnmbus as their
contribution to the War Fund,
the full amount of which has
already been forwarded, . al
though it was necessary to bor
row money to be able to do so.
The present drive is for the pur
pose ot paying baclf money
loaned and to increase the No
gales contribution, if possible,
to double the assigned quota,
says the Herald.
This war is not one of either
political or icligious affiliations.
but a war ot all the people lor
all the people. That the Catho
lics have not been remiss in
their duties as American citizens
is borne out by the fact that 40
per cent of our National Army
is composed of Catholics and
this out of a 16 per cent popula
tion of our country. The Noga
les Council Knights of Columbus
has contributed fifteen of its
members to the army up to this
date and all of its members have
contributed freely and generous
ly to Y. M. C. A., Red Cross,
Liberty Loans and other popu
lar war subscriptions.
The Y. M. C. A. required and
has raised, through the genero
sity of the American people 35,
000,000 for the urosecution of
their war activities. The Knights
of Columbus propose and have
approximately completed a war
fund of only 5,000,000 with
which they expect to do much
more than their proportionate
amount of work among the sol
diers through the fact that
chaplains and secretaries are
mostly volunteers, drawing no
pay whatsoever.
In regard to the work proposed
and being ' done at our army
camps and "over there" this is
as broad in its scope as that of
Y. M. C. A. or any other
organization engaged in camp
activities and is not dedicated
alone to the men of Catholic
faith.
PRAISE COLLECTOR HARDY.
Co-Operation of Officials Prevents
Loss of Valuable Products.
Local merchants, commission
men and producers of vegetables
in Sonora are elated over the
quick adjustment made of a tem
porary tieup in moving perish
able goods from Sonora to the
Nogales port. Owing to the re
cent announcement by the War
Trade Board that import licenses
would be required nearly one
hundred carloads of vegetables,
consisting of peppers, beans,
onions, etc., were held across
the line awaiting delivery to con
signees in Arizona and else
where. The matter was taken up by
Col. Hardy of the customs office,
who acting in conjunction with
the local War Trade Board office
and officials of the Nogales
Chamber of Commerce, succeed
ed in getting permission from
the federal authorities at Wash
ingcon to continue the vegeta
bles to destination, the consign
ments including all cars then in
transit from points in Sonora to
Arizona.
Nogales merchants are parti
cularly pleased vith the celerity
by which the shipments were
expedited and are loud in praise
for the prompt action taken by
Collector of Customs, Col. Chas.
Hardy. Herald.

WILL SEND 190 MORE MEN.
Not more than 190 men will go
from Arizona to Port Riley on or
about March 4 when the final 15
per cent of the first quota is
called, according to an announ
cement made recently at the
office of Colonel Charles W.
Harris, adjutant general.

lowing the receipt from Wash
ington of an answer to the tele
gram of Governor Hunt and
Colonel Harris which had insist
ed that Arizona had not been
given full credit for men sent to
the training camps. In a call

been sent, for which apparently
no credit had been given, the

Arizona officials to "send the
balance of men due."

GALLEO HER FAMILY
TO HER BEDSIDE
Six Tears Ago, Thinking She Might Die, Says Texas Lady, Bat New
She Is a Well, Strong Woman and Praises Carded For
Her Recovery.
Royuo City, Tex. Mrs. Mary KH
man, of this place, Bays; "After the
birth of my little girl... my aide com
meaced to hurt me. I had to go back
to bed. We called the doctor. He
treated me. . .but I got no better. I
got worse and worse until the misery
was unbearable. .. I was In bed for
three months and suffered such agony
that I was just drawn up in a knot. . .
I told ruy husband if he would get
me a bottle of Cardul I would try It. . .
1 ' coinmencsd taking it, however, that
3venins I called my family about
tne. . . for I knew I could not last
aiany days untfess I had a change for j
the better. That was six years agt
and I am still here and am a well,
strong woman, and I owe my life to
Cardul. I had only taken half tbs
bottle when I began to feel better.
The misery In my Bide got less... I
continued right on taking the Cardul
until I had taken three bottles and f
did not need any more for I was well
and never felt better In my life I
have never had any trouble from that
day to this."
Do you suffer from headache, back
ache, pains in sides, or other discom
forts, each month? Or do you feel
weak, nervous and fagged-out? If bo,
give Cardui, the woman's tonic, a
trial. J. 71
