the year ended Dec. 31, 1917,
had earnings equal to $10.93 a

the preceding year.
The Arizona State Bureau of
Mines has issued a bulletin on
manganese which serves as an
excellent guide to prospectors
for that mineral, giving field
methods of identification, etc.
This bulletin is for distribution
and may be obtained by writing
the Director, State Bureau of
Mines, Tucson, Arizona.
William G. McAdoo is such a
matter of fact talker when he
does get off on to an imaginative
flight it is worth considering.
When he told the Texans the
other day that "there is not
room enough in this great world
for the German flag and the
American flag and we are going
to make the American flag fly
over Berlin before we get
through," it was not bragga
docio such as some other promi
nent person might have said.

The United States Pood Ad
ministration has refused to issue
a license to Joseph Schwertner,
of Willcox, Arizona, following a
hearing on the charge of hoard
ing flour and violations of the
"fifty fifty" rule. He was found
to be holding 60,000 pounds of
wheat flour. Schwertner has
agreed to dispose of all of his
stocks of licensed commodities
within a month and to turn over
voluntarily to the Government
the 60,000 pounds of flour as
well as 23 sacks of cane sugar
which he had in stock.
The largest land deal closed in
the valley of late years is that
of the sale of the S. P. Morgan
ranch, consummated last Wed
nesday week, for $11,600 for 480
acres, George Tweedy, of Lios
Angeles, being the purchaser.
The land is in the shallow water
belt and the pumping plant is
delivering about 2,000 gallons of
water per minute. Mr. Morgan
made a success of his farming
venture and has demonstrated
the possibilities of the valley

worked together. Casa Grande

Friendships like those posses
sed by Former Division Engineer
Mathews of the Southern Pa
cific, among the employes of the
division, throw into the shadow
the things which men strive for
in this workuday world money,
honors, power. The employes
of the division have presented to
him as a token of their regard,
a five-hundred dollar Liberty
Bond and a silver service. This
was an intimate expression as
between a man and his friends,
but it is permitted to others to
marvel, "What a beautiful thing
is friendship!"
To a Phoenix woman, Mrs.
Minnie E. Smith, on Tuesday
was awarded a patent for a di
rection signal for automobiles.
The invention embodies among
other features a signal arm
adapted to be controlled by a
foot-operated mechanism to in
dicate the course the machine is
to take. The signal arm is
placed above the hood and is to
be illuminated at night by a
small light connected with the
engine battery. Mrs. Smith has
lived in Arizona for more than
twenty years. She is a widow
with one daughter. Pern, 19
years old. They reside at Five
Points, in Phoenix.
Miss Margaret Cronin, the 15
year old daughter of State Lib
rarian Cronin of Phoenix, is the
proud possessor of her commis
sion as an authorized junior four
minute man. The commission is
duly issued from Washington by
authority of the government, and
is signed by W. McCormick
Blair, national director of four
minute men. Miss Cronin is a
student at the Adams school in
Phoenix, and will join the forces
of four minute men now doing
duty in Phoenix, speaking prin
cipally at schools. Already she
has delivered several talks at
the Indian school and other
schools in the city and county.
Two per cent of the enlisted
personnel of the divisions and
detached units of the Regular 1
Army, national Guard and Na
tional Arrny, excepting the
Coast Artillery and various staff
corps, will be designated to at
tend the fourth series of officers
training schools, which will open
May 15th. Admission has also
been granted to some men who
have had at least one year's mili
tary training under army officers
at educational institutions which
have earned government recog
nition. W. G. McAdoo, director gen
eral of railroads, is asking that
all suits for personal injuries,
claims for freight and damage
be brought in the jurisdiction
where the cause of action arises.
At the present time many suits
are brought in courts far remote
from the residence of the plain
tiffs for the purpose of getting
into a jurisdiction more favor
able for the plaintiff. This is to
be tabooed by the government
while the railroads are under
the present control. All suits
must now be brought in the
counties where the plaintiffs
reside.
The first stage of the fight
waged by Senator Mulford Win
sor for the development of water
for the reclamation of approxi
mately half a million acres of
fertile land in the Wenden re
gion has been won. The State
Land Department has appro
priated $20,000 for the putting
down of demonstration wells in
that area under the direction of
A. L. Harris, an irrigation en
gineer of Phoenix and Los An
geles. At the last legislature
Winsor secured an amendment
to our Land Act that made pos
sible to appropriation for this
purpose.
FLUX GETS NEW MACHINERY
New machinery for the Flux
mine is arriving. Already two
large engines have been unload
ed from the cars preparatory to
removal to the mine, and more
machinery is on the way. Mr.
Fred. Kollberg and associates,
who have taken over the prop
erty on a bond and lease, are
going to work with the deter
mination to make a paying mine
of this extensive property , which
has thousands of tons of ore
blocked out.
The Flux mine, at one time
called the Goshen mine, is 4
miles south of Patagonia and
two and a half miles from the
railroad, about a mile within the
mountains from their north edge,
in the head of Flux Gulch. It
is reached by a good wagon road
of easy grade.
It was worked about 1882, and
several thousand tons of ore
was shipped to the Benson smelt
er. Later it was taken up by
Col. R. R. Richardson and part
ners under the present location
title, which date's from January,
1897. During that year it pro
duced nearly 1000 tons of ore.
Still later, through purchase,
the title passed to Colonel Rich
ardson, who has just given a
bond and lease to Bisbee capi
talists. The mine is developed by more
than 5000 feet of work". The
work consists mainly of tunnels,
shafts, drifts, crosscuts, and
stopes, and is distributed on four
levels, 70, 100, 125 and 260 feet
below the surface. Patagonian.
ADDING TO THE FOOD SUPPLY.
An important work taken up
by the Maricopa County Council
of Defense, is the planting this
summer to milo maize of every
possible acre, including about
4,000 acres of land that is new
or without winter crop. It is
appreciated that the wheat crop
of Arizona will not be sufficient
to even feed the population of
the state.
Milo will fill in the gap very
nicely, maturing in the fall, tho
some of the acreage may be
planted at once, maturing that
much earlier. Where water for
irrigation is availa ble,it is urged
that milo be planted on every
available plot, for hay and feed
will be short next winter, while
milo Hour has been demostrated
to be excellent. Guardian.

FRANK POWERS' BANK
Famous Old Silver Bonanza Sold tS
Eastern Capitalists.
The World's Fair mine, in
Alum Gulch, near Harshaw, has
changed hands, and the mine
will start work immediately,
says the Santa Cruz Patagonian.
This is good news for Patago
nia, as the World's Fair is one
of the richest silver properties
in the district, and Mr. Frank
Powers, who has owned the
mine for many years, has not
been doing the amount of work
that the rich property warrant
ed. As Mr. Frank Powers ex
plained Wednesday, he did not
have the capital necessary to
carry on the work on the scale
that it should he done, and a
company can do the property
justice.
The parties purchasing the
mine are from the east. Mr. A.
A. Holland, an expert metallur
gist, is in charge of the work of
sampling the ore, and a Mr.
Smith is in charge of the devel
opment work. Mr. Holland,
when seen Wednesday was not
ready to give the details of the
sale, but said at a later date be
would give the public all the in
formation that was to be given
out.
At this time it might be well
to give a short history of the
World's Fair mine, which has
been known for its high-grade
silver ore for many years.
The World's Fair is near the
center of the western part of the
Harshaw district, two miles west
of Harshaw, on Alum Gulch, at
an elevation of about 4680 feet.
It was located in 1879 by a man
named McNamee, who shipped a
considerable quantity of ore from
it and is said to ha e abandoned
it in 1881. In 1883 Wm. Moran
relocated the property and in
1884 sold it to Frank Powers for
$100. Mr. Powers is reported
to have soon shipped a few car
loads of ore of 50 tons each,
which brought from $8000 to
$25,000 a car, and by 1903 it was
said that $600,000 worth of ore
had been blocked out in the
mine ready to ship. Since its
acquisition by Mr. Powers it has
been worked at intervals only,
but has always produced con
siderable rich ore, which was
mined or milled and shipped as
desired. In 1907, for instance,
the production was $74,210 worth
of ore, in lead, copper, gold and
silver. During the year 1910
the production was $42,730.82.
In 1912 a shipment of a few car
loads, mostly very rich ore, is
reported to have been made to
the Selby smelter in California.
Early in August, 1914, the mine
was said to be shipping two car
loads of rich ore a week to
Douglas.
The property comprises a
group of eight claims and is re
ported to have produced more
than $1,000,000, of which over
$500,000 was in high grade ore.
The mine contains about 15,
300 feet of drifts, tunnels, stopes,
shafts, and winzes.
The new owners are welcome
to the district, and the World's
Pair mine, already famous as a
producer, bids fair to become
still more so, if the intentions of
the present owners are carried
to completion. It is understood
that a mill and all necessary
machinery and men will be used
to make the mine a big pro
ducer. A good road, with easy
grades, is to be constructed to
make freighting easy.
The Cochise county road bond
issue of $1,000,000 has been ap
proved by the Capital Issue
Committee in Washington and
the bonds can now be issued and
sold with the approval of the
United States government. This
is indeed a victory for the coun
ty as the government, through
thiscominittee.has turned down a
number of bond issues through
out the United States in the past
few months. E. D. MILLER. Editor and Prop.

POLITICAL ANNOUNCEMENTS.
QEMOCRATIC TICKET.
Election, Monday, May 27, 1918.
For Council :
James A. Harrison,
George H. Fiedler,
Wirt G. Bowman,
GrcoRGR W. Dunbar,
E. R. Butleu,
W. H. Smith,
T. M. Fokd, Jr.
Vote the straight Democratic
ticket.
George W. Dunbar, the real
estate man, who is a candidate
on the Domocratic municipal
ticket for town trustee, since
coming to Nogales, has added
many thousand dollars to the
taxroll of the city. He and the
company he represents can be
depended upon to at all times
guard the interests of every
property owner. By voting the
straight Democratic ticket you
will cast a vote for a man who
will be present at all meetings
of the Council, a man who is not
identified with so called factions,
a man who will at all times do his
duty for Nogales, as he sees it.
George H. Fiedler's name
on the Democratic ticket, for
town trustee, is a guarantee that
for the next two years, Nogales
will be represented, where mat
ters of interest to the whole
town are concerned, by a man
who has had wide experience in
the conduct of affairs for the
city and county. In the past
George Fiedler has given gen
erously of his time and exper
ience to the taxpayers of No
gales. If elected with the other
candidates on the Democratic
ticket, May 27th, his past ex
perience will be invaluable to
the town during the next two
years, which promise to be history-making.
With James A. Harrison a
member of the Nogales Town
Council, the affairs of the town
for the next two years, during a
time when capable, loyal Amer
ican citizens should be on guard
everywhere, taxpayers will have
no cause to worry. Ex-Senator
Harrison, who is now serving on
the council, is one of the county
and city's big taxpayers. He is
interested largely in. the town's
welfare, and will in the future
as in the past, be found at all
times "on the job," casting his
vote for a bigger and better No
gales. The voters of Nogales
will make no mistake by voting
for Senator Harrison. His re
election on the Democratic ticket
is assured.
The election of W. H. (Will)
Smith, to a seat at the Town
Council table, May 27th, is con
ceded by everybody who has
had business dealings with him
during the many years he has
been serving the city, as Judge
or Clerk. Always accommodat
ing, courteous and efficient, Will
has made a host of friends, Re
publicans and Democrats, who
will vote for him for any office,
city or county, he may desire.
His long experience with affairs
of the city, will make him a
valuable member of the Town
Council. In persuading him to
become a candidate, the Demo
crats had in mind the town's
welfare. Will Smith is a con
sistent Democrat, as such he
will represent all of Nogales.
Wirt G. Bowman is one of
Nogales' most successful, pro
gressive businesss men. The
Bowman hotel, the Nogales
Theatre, the mammoth business
houses on Grand avenue and the
elegant Bowman manshion on
Cavalry Hill, are evidences of
his lasting faith and confidence
in his home town. No man in
Nogales is more interested in
the welfare of Nogales. He is
independent of all private in
terests and will devote his time
for a greater Nogales, without
having to take orders from an
man or any set of men who have
axes to grind, for their own mo
tives. As a candidate on the
Democratic ticket to be voted on
May 27, he should receive the
support of all factions, be they
Republicans or Democrats.
R. E. Butt.er, cashier of The
Nogales National Bank, who is
a candidate on the Democratic
ticket for Town Trustee, is in
every way qualified to represent
the taxpayers of Nogales. For
a long time "George," by which
name he is known by his friends,
occupied a responsible position
with the First National Bank of
Nogales, resigning to accept the
cashiership of the Nogales Na
tional Bank. Mr. Butler enjoys
the fullest confidence of every
one with whom he has business
dealings. He is thoroughly com
petent and reliable, at all times.
Taxpayers will make no mistake
in electing him a member of the
Town Council, on May 27th.
Like the other gentlemen, whose
names appear on the Democratic
ticket, Mr. Butler is a loyal De
mocratic American citizen, who
believes in giving every man, or
corporation, a square deal.
The Spirit of Friendship.
This store locks upon its patrons not

merely as customers but as friends.
People purchase here because they
have friendly feeling for this store.
Tho cause whk-h develops this f.-iendly
feellntr, may differ, in fact, they are
sure to differ. One's friendship for
the store is the r es n It of rinding good
values; iifiot lei's is the result of effi
cient .-erviie and courteous treatment,
and so on.
A vote for T. M. Ford, Jr.,
is a vote for an experienced busi
ness man who will devote his
time, without money and without
price, to the upbuilding of No
gales. He is manager of the J.
D. Halstead Lumber Company,
with which he has been connect
ed for a number of years. Be
sides being an expert bookkeep
er and account, Mr. Ford, who
seeks a place on the Common
Council, is a high class, honor
able gentleman. He will repre
sent the people in a -careful,
painstaking manner, at all times
mindful of the taxpayers' inter
ests. When matters of import
come before the honorable Com
mon Council for consideration,
Councilman Ford will be found
casting his vote for Nogales, not
for Tom, Dick or Harry. Mr.
Ford is a consistant Democrat
entitled to the hearty support of
every Democrat in Nogales pre
cinct number one. Don't forget
him on election day.

Many thousands of
women suffering from
womanly trouble, have
been benefited by the use
of Cardui, the woman's
tonic, according to letters
we receive, similar to this
one from Mrs. Z. V. Spell,
of Hayr.e, N. C. "I could
not stand on my feet, End
just suffered terribly,"
she says. "As my suf
fering was so great, and
he had tried other reme
dies, Dr. had us
get Cardui. . . I began
improving, and it cured
me. I know, and my
doctor knows, what Car
dui did for me, for my
nerves and health were
about gone."
TAKE
Hie Woman's Tonic
She writes further: ' I
am in splendid health . . .
C3n do my work. I feel I
owe it to Cardui, for I was
in dreadful condition."
If ycu are nervous, run
down and weak, or suffer
from headache, backache,
etc., every month, try
Cardui. Thousands of
women praise this medi
cine for the good it has
done them, and many
physicians who have used
Cardui successfully with
their women patients, for
years, endorse this medi
cine. Think what it means
to be in splendid health,
like Mrs. Spell. Give
Cardui a trial.
