The body of a two-headed calf
of Hereford strain, was shown
at Clovis, N. M., this week by
E. W. McGuire, a rancher living
seven miles east of Farwel!,Tex
Both heads were perfectly form
ed. The calf lived three days
after birth, being fed by Mr.
McGuire. He has sent the heads
and hide to a taxidermist for
mounting.
The committee on transporta
tion of which Col. Epes Ran
dolph of Tucson is chairman,
has added to its comprehensive
reports on file with the Arizona
Council of Defense by compiling
a list or all auto truclrs in the

There has not been much said
about the cotton crops of Casa
Grande valley, but when the
harvest comes the report will be
good. More people have been
growing cotton than one would
suppose, considering the late
ness with which the idea was
aunched. The several fields
that were planted seem to bear
witness to the fact this valley is
an ideal cotton section. uis

The sheriffs of all counties
have responded promptly to re
quests of the Arizona Council of
Defense for lists of all motion

George J. Stoneman, of the Pour

An effort Is being made by the
Arizona Live Stock Sanitary
Board to simplify the brands of
the state by reducing the num

thousand brands recorded it is
estimated that only about half
are in actual use. A letter has
ust been sent out by Secretary
Stevens asking the stockmen to
relinquish such brands as they
no longer use, so that the diffi
cult matter of securing new
brands will in a measure be obviated.

OUR COUNTRY.
This is the country of our
birth, the fairest land on all the
earth. Here freedom is a living
thing, no fake invented by a
king. No galling yokes are on
our backs, we groan beneath no
unjust tax, the government is
all our own and not the ukase
from a throne. The great re
public of the west! The haven
of the worlds oppressed, the
vital text of all who plan a
worldwide brotherhood of man,
America! Ten million eyes are
grazing where tier Danner nies,
nd countless hearts forever-
more make plans to reach tne
reemao's shore. Besides the
Gangers' sullen flow, and by the
winding, storied Po, wherever
men are tired and worn, where-
ver heartsick toilers mourn,
wherever life is sad and gray,
the eyes of thousands turn this
way. And that their eyes may
to us turn, and that our beacons
till may burn, informing all
pon this sphere that freedom's
till existing here, we take once
more tne sword ana orana to
battle for our native land. For
reedom, in the people's sight,
f we surrendered what is right,
would be as dark and foul a
thing as though invented by a
ing. Walt Mason.

All Men in
2200 Cooks and Bakers Wanted.
Twenty-two hundred men are
wanted in the army for duties
which do not involve a great
deal of peril. They are wanted
for cooks and bakers, according
to the following orders from the
adjutant general received at the
recruiting office in Phoenix.
In order that the training of
bakers and cooks for the in
creased forces may be started at
once it is requested that 1700
privates to be trained as bakers
and 500 to be trained as cooks
be transferred to the quarter
master's corps at once.
These should as far as possi
ble be from men who have had
experience as cooks or bakers in
the army or in civil life. If not,
they should be men of good phy
sique, strong and robust, who
are willing to be trained as bak
ers and cooks.

The gravity of the task which
faces members of the local draft
exemption boards is called to
their attention in solemn lan
guage in a communication sent
broadcast by the war depart"
ment and made public by Pro
vost Marsal General Crowder.
General Crowder's communi
cation, mailed to all boards,
reads as follows:
"You are entiring on a difficult
task, the gravity of which fa be
yond anything that can be said
in the way of discussion. -You
realize the significance of what
you are to do and you know that
a responsibility heavier perhaps
than any you "have ever faced,
is upon you.
"War demands individual sa
crifice to the common cause. No
people ever approached war with
a calmer appreciation of that
sacrifice or a firmer resolve to
bear it and to present them
selves to be classified for service
in the place to which it shall
best serve the common good to
call them. This calm determi
nation could not exist were it
not lor the conhdence of the na
tion in its institutions. In this
particular confidence is found
the very spirit of the selective
service law. The most sacred
rights of country, home and
family are entrusted for adjudi
cation to local citizens and ofti
cials, nominated by state gov
ernors and approved by the pre
sident. "The most equitable rules that
could be devised have been pres
cribed for your guidance a'nd the
administration of these rules and
the sacrifice that-is offered by
your neighbors is entrusted to
your hands.
"From every one is demanded
a sacrifice. But here is one
thought to be !tept always in
your-mind. The selected man
offers his life. There is -no
greater giving than this; an
that thought should guide you
always. There may be a "few
who will urge upon you claims
for exemption or discharge that,
whatever may be your inclina
tions of sympathy or affection,
you will know ought not to be
granted. It will strengthen you
to remember that for every ex-,
emption or discharge that is
made for individual convenience
or to escape personal los3 of
money or property, or for favor
or affection, some other man
whose time would not otherwise
have come, must incur the risk
of losing his life.
"There can be no room for
hesitation in such a case.
"Another freedom thought is
this:
"You are
adjustment
tween two
versy.
"You are agents of the gov
ernment, engaged in securing
men for the government and
there is no controversy. You
are acting for the government.
There is not one exemption or
discharge in the law or regula
tions that is put there for the
benefit of any individual. All
are there for the benefit of the
nation and to the end that the
whole nation may be a team in
which each man shall play the
part for which he is best fitted.
"Therefore no one has a vest
ed right, by himself or by attor
ney to urge, by argument or
pleading, his individual case
upon you. You should rigidly
exclude this. Ordinarily you
should act on the affidavits. If
you desire more proof you may
get it. But no claimant has a
right to submitother proof than
that called for by regulations or
than that you may call for.
"There should be no rule like
those of court procedure; no
technical rules of evidence.
You "should proceed to investi
gate cases about which you are
not satisfied exactly as you, an
individual, would proceed to in
form yourself about any fact
about which you are in doubt.
"Last of all, it is important to
say a word about your own sac
rifices. The place to which you
have been called is one which no
man would seek save in the per-
highest
real
formance of one of the
of patriotic duties.
There is not, in any
sense, any remuneration. Be
cause thousands of citizens urg
ed members of local boards
should not be placed in a posi
tion of performing their erave
duties for pay, the regulations
provide that ordinaily, the ser
vice shall be uncompensated.
Because it was not desired that
any ma be prevented from ren
dering the service by the neces
sity for earning his daily bread,
a small remuneration was pro
vided. "The nation needs men and
needs them quickly. The hours
will then be long and the work
absorbing. The duty is always
to take and never to give, and
human nature is snch there will
be little praise and some blame.
The sacrifice of many of those
whose characters are to bo de
sired is no greater than that of
men who are to decide them and
your only reward must be the
knowledge that at great person
al sacrifice, you are rendering
your country an indispensible
service in a matter of utmost
mement."
ADJUTANT GEN. HARRIS FIRED.
not a court for the
of differences be
persons in contro-
The removal of Adjutant Gen
eral Charles W. Harris of the
Arizona National Guard, was
sought last Saturday, by Gov
ernor Campbell in the following
letter addressed to Col. Harris:
"Colonel Charles W. Harris,
adjutant general of Arizona,
state house, Phoenix. Sir: Your
resignation as adjutant general
of Arizona, effective August 1,
1917, is hereby requested. You
will turn over all state property
under your jurisdiction to Capt.
Oscar F. Temple, who will be
instructed to receipt for the
same. Sincerely, Thomas E.
Campbell, Governor of Arizona."
The only statement made by
Governor Campbell with refer
ence to the letter requesting the
resignation of Colonel Harris
was that "after August 0, when
the entire national guard will be
in the federal service, there will
be no duty for the adjutant gen
eral to perform. If later Ariz
ona should be called upon to
raise another regiment of state
troops, I shall want another ad
jutant general."
The action of the governor is
said to have been precipitated
by certain reports which the ad
jutant general has made regard
ing the strike situation and
which have been characterized
by the governor as "seditious."

CALLES GOES TO NEW YORK.
The copper situation in Son
ora was reflected yesterday in
the significant departure of
Governor P. Elias Calles, gov
ernor of Sonora, for New York,
says Thursday morning's Tuc
son Star. He was accompanied
by Raul R Dominguez, Mexican
consul of Tucson.
Since the withdrawal of the
copper companies from Sonora,
under the pressure of exorbitant
taxes and attempts to exact
taxes for land relinquished years
ago, Governor Calls has been
in active correspondence with
the copper officials at the border
apparently with no result.
The trouble at several points
hava been settled, but the big
companies have given no indica
tion of returning to Sonora.
The departure of Gov. Calles
for New York is taken as an in
dication that Governor Calles
has decided to carry his invita
tion for a return to his state to
the headquarters of the mining
companies in New York.
Later. This morning Gen
eral Calles, who has been pro
moted commander of the mili
tary forces in Sonora & Chihua
hua, left for Magdalena, accom
panied by his staff. It is said
that he will in a few days de
part for Chihuahua to take the
field against Villa's army of
rebels. General Soriano, one
of Carranza's most capable offi
cers, has been appointed Gov
ernor of Sonora.

No Difgrace for You To Be Drafted.
Is your number far up in the
list, as drawn in the lottery at
Washington? If so, it is your
privilege to fight to uphold the
sacred principles of humanity,
oppose tyranny and maintain the
honor and dignity of the United
States. If not, your turn may
come later.
Reports are current that draft
ed men, not only in this county,
but all over the country, are,
many of them, using all kinds of
personal influence with exemp
tion boards to be released. For
every man exempt, this means
that the next man lower down
the list will be called. It is not
a disgrace to be drafted, but it is
a disgrace for a drafted man
to try to use his position, his
wealth, or his inflnence to avoid
service to his country when lit
is drafted.
There are many legitimate ex
emptions, and in such cases
where service in the army means
that the wife and children are
left without support, exemption
upon the ground of dependents
is perfectly proper. In some sec
tions of the country drafted men
have sought to employ lawyers
to plead their exemptions before
exemption boards. Questioning
the propriety of such employ
ment, the Illinois State Bar As
sociation has adopted a resolu
tion to the effect that it is con
sidered unprofessional for a law
yer to appear before an exemp
tion board and plead for the
exemption from service of any
individual drafted. Guardian.
The cattlemen of the South
west are not selling their heifers
and young cows as freely as
they formerly did. This will
tend to materially increase the
number of range cattle in the
country. Every effort should be
made by cattlemen to increase
the capacity of their ranges in
order to enlarge herds, and
money loaners should be more
liberal in letting legitimate cat
tlemen have money to make ne
cessary improvements on the
ranges to increase these herds.

Sis Years Ago, TLinkirg She Might Die, Says Texas Lady, Bat How
She Is a Weilj Strong Woman and Praises Cardoi For
Ker Recovery.
Roj-3e City. Tex. Mrs. Mary KI1
uiau, of this place, says; "After the
birth cf my little girl... my side com
uoaccd to hurt' me. I had to go back
to bod. Vi'e called the doctor. He
treated mo... 'out I got no better. I
Sot tvors e and worse until the misery
T23 unbearable ... I was In. bed for
i.hvee months and suffered euch agony
.hat I ira3 just drawn up In a knot. . .
I told my husband if he would get
r.c a bottle of Cardui I would try it. . .
I commenced taking it, however, that
2V02izc; I called my family about
S3... for I knew I co-.ild not last
jja:;y days uiArrs I had a chance for
the better. That was six years ago
and I am etlll here and am a well,
strong woman, and I owe my life to
Cardui. I had only taken half tha
bottle when I began to feel better.
The misery in my side got less... I
continued right on taking the Cardui
until I had taken thiee bottles and I
did not nsed any more for I was well
and never felt better in my life... I
have nevfer had any trouble from that
day to this."
Do you suffer from headache, back
ache, pains in sides, or other discom
forts, each month? Or do you feel
weak, nervous and fagged-out? If eo,
give Cardui, the woman's tonic, a
trial. J. 71
