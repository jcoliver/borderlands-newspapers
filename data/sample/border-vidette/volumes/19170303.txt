A bill setting aside territories
in Cochise and Santa Cruz coun-
ties to be known as the Hua-
cnuca oi-ate uame rreserve, nas
passed the United State Senate,
according to notification received
by Supervisor Johnson of the
Coronado national forest.
The Satnoan mine, lying south
of the Lucky Boy east of Chlor
ide, is soon to be tapped by a
tunnel 1400 feet long at a depth
of approximately 700 feet. The
bore will bring the rich vein
known to exist within easy tran
sportation and do away with
packing.
The mill of the Leviathan
Mines company is now turning
out forty per cent molybdenum
which is sold at Yucca at $1000
per ton. It is expected that the
ore values will greatly exceed
this when the present plans for
the new flotation plant are in
operation, and that values as
high as 70 per cent of 90 will be
reached.
W. J. Mitchell, representing
the Standard Metals Company,
which has recently taken over
the old Mowry mine, says plans
are going ahead satisfactorily
for the early operation of this
famous old property. About the
first part of next month every
thing is scheduled to be complet
ed on the deal and immediately
work will start.
The board of supervisors of
Navajo county has called a bond
election to pass on the proposi
tion of issuing 125,000 worth of
road bonds for this county. It
is generally conceded that the
issue will pass in which event a
number of bridges recently con
structed in the county over the
many difficult little rivers will be
connected up with good roads..
Development has begun on
the Black Cat group of claims
about four and a half miles
southwest of Salome. The vein
outcroppiugs are plainly visible
for a considerable distance on
the surface and are twenty-five
feet in width, with the copper
values running in varying values
from $8.00 per ton to $100. A
road is being constructed from
the railroad to the mine.
A franchise has been granted
for the immediate erection and
operation of an electric light
plant for the town of Tombstone.
The initial cost of the plant will
be $15,000. Streetlights will be
installed at the street intersec
tions, and Tombstone will begin
to assume city airs. Oil burning
engines will be used tor the
generation of alternating cur
rent. E. Lj. Wright secured the
franchise for J. B. Downey.
The largest shipment of beans
recorded in Arizona were receiv
fd in FlaerstafT bv Babbitt Bros.
from a little settlement eighteen
miles south of fcsnownake in Na
vajo county. Sixty thousand
pounds is the weight of the ship
ment. The beans were raised
on some of the dry farms in that
section, and represent some of
the same varieties that won
prizes at the Denver Interna
tional Dry Farm congress in
1915.
Sir Gilbert Parker, M. P., one
of the notable figures in the
British Empire, will spend the
winter this year in Arizona, after
an absence of some six years. Sir
Gilbert is known all over the
world for his splendid novels,
while his services to the British
Empire in a political way are no
less noted. Since visiting here
before Sir Gilbert has been an
enthusiastic booster for the Salt
River valley and Castle Hot
Springs, which he also visited.
Frank W. Turner, Sam Smith
and W. P. McComas are back
rom their trip into Sonora,
Mexico where they went to in
spect some valuable mining
properties. They went as far
south as Boludo, and everywhere
were most courteously received
by the natives who appeared
anxious to have the American
mining companies in that sec
tion resume operations. Mr.
Turner expects to go back to
Mexico in a short time. Tempe

BIG PARADE FOR STOCKMEN.
El Paso Makes Extensive Preparations
for Convention.
A military review in which
fully 35,000 troops of all aims
will participate will be one of the
imposing leatures of the annual
convention of the Panhandle and
Southwestern Stockmen's as
sociation which will be held in
El Paso March 6. 7 and 8. next.
The review will be the greatest
in point of numbers of men par
ticipating ever held in the south
west and there will be an added
interest in the pageant from the
fact that in the long line, which
will pass through the streets of
El Paso on that occasion, will be
the Veteran infantry, cavalry
and artillery regiments which
made up the punitive expedition
which went into Mexico in
search of Villa and which have
but just returned to American
soil after an arduous ten months
in the mountain fastnesses and
on the deserts of the southern
republic.
This will be the first time since
the Civil war that the people of
the United States will have had
an opportunity to see so many
men under arms in one body.
and particularly will it be the
first time the residents of the
southwest will have had such an
opportunity.
The review will be held on the
morning of the first day of the
cattle convention Tuesday,
March 6, and will be the leading
feature of the week of festivities
which has been planned for the
visitors.
For delegates and other visit
ors who arrive early the com
mittee having in charge the en
tertainment of visitors has
planned cabaret shows at the
Hotel Paso del Norte and the
Sheldon on Monday night, March
5.
Fallowing the review on Tues
day the convention will hold its
first business sessien at the Texas
Grand theater. The evening will
be given over to dancing at the
hotels and Little Plaza, which
will be brilliantly lighted and
otherwise made ready for the
host of merrymakers expected.
All delegates to the conven
tion will attend the Rio Grande
frontier day sports as guests of
the Chamber of Commerce,
Wednesday afternoon, March 6.
The sports will be staged for the
first time that day. An espe
cially good program will be put
on for the occasion.
Purses aggregating $4000 have
been provided for the conte
stants in the Frontier day sports
which will consist of bronco bust
ing by the best riders in the
country, both men and women;
steer roping and riding, bull
dogging, trick and fancy riding,
etc., including a number of
events arranged for soldiers of
all branches of military service.

'OUR DUTY IS PLAIN."
President Wilson Asks Leave to Use
Armed Force.
Washington, Feb. 26 Pre
sident Wilson, addressed a joint
session of congress today at 1
o'clock and expressed the hope
that it will be unnecessary to
put "armed force into action"
but he specifically asked autho
rity to supply American mer-
; chantmen with defensive arms.
with means of using them and
to employ any other instrument
alities, as well as sufficient cre
dit, to enable him to provide
adequate means of protection.
This without being specific,
was a request for the use of the
army and navy and money to
make them effective.
He said he already had implied
authority but wished specific au
thority before congress adjourn
ed. He said he was unable to
specify his plans. "The form
in which action may become
necessary cannot yet be fore
seen, said the president. "I
believe the people are willing to
trust me to act with restraint.
"No one doubts what it is
our duty to do. We must defend
our commerce and the liyes of
our people with discretion, but
clear, steadfast purpose. The
only method and extent remain
to be chosen upon occasion if
occasion should indeed arise.
"Since it has unhappily proved
impossible to safeguard neutral
rights by diplomatic means
against unwarranted infringe
ments they are suffering at the
hands of Germany, there may
be no recourse except to armed
neutrality, which we shall know
how to maintain, and for which
there is abundant American
procedent."
Behind American rights, the
President said, he was thinking
of the rights of humanity, but
throughout he proclaimed a
peace policy, if peace is possible.
He said American wanted none
but rights of peace. No course
of my choosing or their's will
lead to war, war can come only
by wilful acts and aggression of
others.
"We are speaking of no selfish
material rights but of rights
which our hearts support, whose
foundation is that righteous pas
sion for justice, upon which all
law, structures of family, state
and mankind must rest, as the
ultimate base of our existence
and liberty.
"I cannot imagine any man
with American principles at his
heart hesitating to defend these
things."
London, Feb. 27 Eight Am
erican negroes, members of the
"Laconia's" crew, died from ex
posure, according to a Queens
town dispatch.
Washington, Feb. 27 The
sinking of the British steamship
"Laconia," with loss of Amer
ican lives, is regarded by the
government as a clear cut viola
tion of American rights accord
ing to authoritative expression
obtained after a conference be
tween President Wilson and
Secretary Lansing. No further
investigation is considered neces
sary. HEAVY TONNAGE INTO MIAMI.
A great part of the tremerdous
freight tonnage coming into
Miami, is the material and sup
plies being shipped in by the big
mining companies. This freight
runs above $125,000 monthly for
the Inspiration Consolidated Cop
per Company alone.
This figure is a conservative
estimate, based on actual calcula
tions at the office of the auditor
of the Inspiration Consolidated
Copper company. Thousands
of tons of timber, dynamite, fuse,
tools, nails, and other necessary
articles are brought in every
month. Added to this is the
new machinery for the enlarge
ments of the various plants,
which is constantly coming in.
New equipment for the mines
and carloads of oil to be used in
i the flotation process of separa
tion are also included In this
colossal estimate. Silver Belt.
TOMBSTONE IS BOOMING.
It has been many moons since
such a general renovation of the
buildings in Tombstone has been
in vogue as it is now. On all
sides we see both residential
and business property being
either built anew, not even in
cluding the big work of the
Bunker Hill on the hill. The
Can Can restaurant is being re
built; the old Warnekros build
ing next to the Huachuca Water
Company office has been rebuilt;
the Tombstone Lumber Yard is
making improvements; the Ma
sonic hall is having many im
provements made on it; the new
electric light plant will soon be
installed and the town complete
ly wired. Work on the streets
from one end of the town to the
other will soon be started. There
is rumor of an up-to date thirty
room hotel being constructed by
outside capital; lots and build
ings are changing hands and &
general air of prosperity covers
the town and it now looks as if
some thirty thousand dollars will
be spent on the c6urt house in
improvements in the near future.

$40,000
For Cantonement
In Yuma.
Buildings
In the army appropriation bill,
which passed congress Friday,
is $40,000 for the construction of
cantonement buildings for the
regular army troops to be main
tained permanently in Yuma.
The item appears in the general
appropriation for similar build
ings at various border points,
and it is made available on ap
proval of the bill by the presid
ent. Already the city council
has taken up the matter of site
and the question has remained
in statu quo pending the passage
of the appropriation and further
instructions from the war de
partment to Colonel Wilson,
commanding the Fourteenth
here. Now the matter will pro
bably be pushed to completion.
The site proposed is on the Yuma
mesa, and Mayor Michelsen
thinks there will be no trouble
in securing it. It is the purpose
of the city to furnish the grounds
on a lease for a given period
with privilege of extension, and
without cost to the government.
A detachment of cavalry is to be
sent here in addition to the in
fantry troops if plans made some
time since have not been chang
ed. Sun.
Schweitzer Gets $2 5,000 Contract.
The town of Casa Grande has
just awarded a contract to the
Schweitzer Machine company of
this city and Phoenix, for a
municipal water light and power
plant, the contract Drice being
$25,079.00. says the Tucson Star.
"Casa Grande is situated in
one of the most fertile valleys of
the west and during the past
few years their representative
citizens and business men have
shown a progressive spirit that
would reflect creditably upon the
largest cities, and a spirit which
is rarely found among the small
er communities," said Mr.
Schweitzer.
"It is reported that capital
from eastern points has been suf
ficiently interested in the future
of Casa Grande to invest in a
large and very modern new
hotel, which will doubtless be
erected in the very near future.
Another new addition worthy of
note is a new up to date garage
building of brick, with a modern
glass front, which will be erect
ed and occupied by a live garage
and repair concern at an early
date."
Chief Forester Graves, head
of the forestry service, herefrom
Washington, held a conference ,
today with John Metz, of the
Merchants Bank & Trust com
pany, and Charles F. Solomon,
of the Arizona National bank,
and told them what would be
necessary to secure the construc
tion of the Oracle road. He told
them they must secure the co
operation of the two counties
and the mining companies in the
construction before the forestry
service could act. A SPLENDID ADDRESS.

NO PARTY LINES.
Republicans and Democrats Hasten to
Support President.
Washington, March 1 Arous
ed by the disclosure of Ger
many's plot to unite Japan and
Mexico with her in a war upon
the United States, and then
convinced by official evidence of
its authenticity, "congress today
abandoned the delays and ob
structions which have checked
President Wilson's efforts to be
clothed with express authority
to deal with the submarine men
ace. The house after a ten hour
debate and by an overwhelming
majority passed a bill to empow
er the president to arm merchant
ships and providing for a hun
dred million dollar bond issue.
The bill, however, does not con
tain the grant of authority to use
"other instrumentalities" which
the president specifically desires
and would prevent government
war insurance for munition
ships, a prohibition which the
president does not approvjed.
When the house bill is receiv
ed in the senate tomorrow, the
senate bill, which the adminis
tration fully, commends, will
be substituted, and that is ex
pected finally to be accepted by
both houses as the law.
Official announcement was
made at the White House today
that the administration stands
behind the senate bill "first,
last and all the time." With its
provision for "other instrument
alities." In the senate an attempt to
ask the president to disclose the
government's source of informa
tion of the attempted intrigues
with Mexico and Japan, on the
supposition that it came from
one of Germany's enemies, was
defeated after a sharp and sen
sational debate. Instead, the
senate merely asked for official
notice of the authenticity of the
despatch of instructions from
German Foreign Minister Zim
merman to German Minister von
Eckhardt in Mexico City. The
president transmitted it imme
diately with the statement that
it would not be compatible with
the public interests to reveal
further details concerning it.
Members of both houses of
congress, some skeptical of the
authenticity of the astounding
revelations of Germany's in
trigue, others feeling that it had
been permitted to become public
for its effect in congress and
throughout the country met the
situation with mixed emotions,
which with a few possible ex
ceptions as the day's develop
ments were unfolded, solidified
into a decision to stand behind
the president.
Congressmen classed with the
so called pacifist group in the
house who have been opposing
a grant of authority to the pre
sident on the ground that it
would be a step toward war, an
nounced that they would vote
for the armed neutrality bill in
the belief that to arm the pre
sident with power to protect
American rights might be the
way to- avoid war.
Republican senators who have
been filibustering against the
armed neutrality bill, not be
cause they were opposed to it,
but to force an extra session of
congress, declared their convic
tion that the situation demanded
the united support of the pre
sident. A congress badly divided, and,
in its dying moments, with its
legislative programs at sixes and
sevens and charges of playing
"politics" flying from every side,
suddenly took on a new aspect.
It was as if the cry "America
first" had rung through the nails
of both houses and the response
had been almost instantaneous.
All proposed amendments to
the measure except those added
in committee were rejected by
the house under an avalanche of
votes. Never since questions
arising out of the European war
began to agitate the house al
most three years ago has there
been such a display of patriotic
non-partisanship as was witness
ed today in the chambers. De
mocrats and Republicans, even
most of the members who here
tofore have aligned themselves
with the extreme pacifist group,
joining in fighting for the bill.
presentative of the Supreme;
Council, Knights of Columbus,
delivered an interesting, very j
instructive address at the
Knights of Columbus Club last
Monday evening. After the
address the Nogales Quartette
composed of Messrs. De Riemer,
Bohrer, Bruner and Handy sang
a number of songs which were
greatly appreciated by those
present. Prom here Mr. Bagley
went to Tucson and other towns
in the state, where he will ad
dress Knights of Columbus
clubs. During his stay in No
gales he was the guest of Attor
ney Prank Barry.
During Mr. Bagley's address,
he said :
"I consider the work of the
religious prejudice committee of
the Knights . of Columbus the
most important of all their un
dertakings, not only for the
good of the order but for the
members of all religions.
"Unless we understand each
other thoroughly we are in dan
ger of a wrong conception of
each other's aims and beliefs.
This committee is striving to
correct misstatements and to
refute untruths. It is endeavor
ing to make religious prejudice
unpopular, and to bring about
harmony and tolerance."
25 YEARS EACH.
Joe Davis and Jeff Spurlock,
convicted of robbing the Golden
State Limited train at Apache
on the night of September 7,
1916, were sentenced by Judge
William Sawtelle in the United
States court yesterday mornirrg
to serve 25 years each in the
federal penitentiary on McNeil
Island, off the coast of the state
of Washington, says the Tucson
Star.
Both men received sentence in
silence. Davis, who is noted at
the county jail for his liveliness
and ready jokes, wore a solemn
countenance as be faced Judge
Sawtelle. Neither man had any
comment to make as the two left
the court room under heavy
guard..
The men were found guilty on
all five counts of an indictment
charging them with train rob
bery. Judge Sawtelle sentenced
them to 25 years on the fifth
count, 25 years on the fourth,
five years on the third and three
years each on the second and
first counts, with announcement
that all sentences are to run
concurrently. This means that
Davis and Spurlock, in serving
out the first 25-year sentence,
will automatically serve all the
other sentences, the actual limit
of confinement being 25 years.
State Senate Repudiates Colodny.
The action of the Board of
Regents of the University of
Arizona in dismissing L Colodny
from the faculty of the Univer
sity, has been upheld by ad in
vestigating committee of the
State Senate. The investiga
tion was at the request of Mr.
Colodny, but the report showed
that his claims were absolutely
without ground. The following
is the report of the committee:
"Your committee on education
and public institutions, having
received from the Senate a com
munication from Mr. Colodny,
alleging unfair proceedure in
his dismissal, wish to report that
we have investigated this matter
and causes leading up to the
same, and find that the dismissal
was absolutely necessary in or
der to maintain the dignity, re
spect and best interests of the
University."
The members of the Committee
on Education and Public Institu
tions who investigated the mat
ter are Senator Whipple, of
Greenlee, Ferguson of Santa
Cruz, Colter of Apache, Maho
ney of Mohave, and Goodell of
Pima.

A GOOD Bl LI
Mining on Indian Reservations Means
Much to Miners.
Thai the Hayden bill to per
mit mining on Indian reserves, a
measure that will add about 20,
000,000 acres to the mineral
lands of this state, is in fair way
to become a law, is the informa
tion received from Represent
ative Hayden by the chamber of
commerce, says the Tombstone
Prospector. The bill passed the
house on September 4, and now
stands a good chance of passing
the senate, opposition of a num
ber of powerful members of that
body having been overcome.
Arizona will profit more than
any other state as much, prac
tically as all others put together
by this bill. There are now
19,551,000 acres of unallotted In
dian lands on the reservation
and to this land the bill opens
the way for the prospector and
mine market. It applies only to
the metal mining rights on such
lands, however, so the operation
of the bill will not release to
possible private development the
coal lands believed to be an im
portant part of at least one In
dian reservation in this state.
For a long time it has been
possible to graze cattle on forest
and Indian reserves by payment
of fees. It is on exactly this
principle that the mineral bill
will work. Indeed, it was the
fee or leasing feature that arous
ed the opposition of such men
as Senators Shafrofch, of Colo
rado, and Smoot of Utah.
The prospector who has locat
ed a tract of mineral Jancl pays
to the interior department for
the Indian reservation fund, 25
cents per acre the first year, 50
cents per acre for the second,
third, fourth and fifth years, and
from that time on, $1 per acre
per year. If the mine becomes
a producer, the fee then is to
constitute 5 per cent of the gross
output, payable monthly to the
Indian bureau.
The bill, should it become a
law, will double the mineral pos
sibilities and in time, the output
of this state.

First Snow Fall in Twenty-Four Years.
Last Sunday morning the
people of Florence were given
an unusual surprise when they
arose to find the ground covered
with snow to a depth of an inch.
Daniel Stevens is authority for
the statement that it was the
first snowfall to be recorded in
Florence since 1883, at which
time a four inch-fall was record
ed. Prior to that a nine inch fall
of snow is told of having come to
Florence in 1879. Out at the
Red Hills three inches fell at
Shepherd's ranch, thirty miles
east of Florence half a foot fell.
The snow was followed by a
warm rain and rapidly disap
peared, the rain fall amounting
to .85 of an inch.
Many children in Florence had
never seen snow except at a
distance and it proved a real
treat for them while it lasted, and
some snowballing was indulged
in at the expense of the snow
balled. But it was lots of fun.
For the farmers and cattle
men the snow was a God send
coming just when it was needed
most. The ground was given a
thorough soaking and grain and
grass will be greatly benefitted.

Yon Need a Tonic
There are times in every woman's life when she
needs a tonic to help her over the hard places.
When that time comes to you, you know what tonic
to take Cardui, the woman's tonic. Cardui is com
posed of purely vegetable ingredients, which act
gently, yet surely, on the weakened womanly organs,
and helps build them back to strength and health.
It has benefited thousands and thousands of weak,
ailing women in its past half century of wonderful
success, and it will do the same for you.
You can't make a mistake in taking

The Woman's Tonic
Miss Amelia Wilson, R. F. D. No. 4, Alma, Ark.,
says: "I think Cardui is the greatest medicine on earth,
for women. Before I began to take Cardui, I was
so weak and nervous, and had such awful dizzy
spells and a poor appetite. Now I feel as well and
as strong as I ever did, and can eat most anything."
Begin taking Cardui today. Sold by all dealers.
