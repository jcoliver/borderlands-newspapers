war department, the regimental
coQimanders of the national
guard in nine western states

The cattle ranges in the coun
try surrounding Benson have
been in worse condition for
grazing this spring than in
many years, the grass? and vege
tation being held back by the
drought and the unusual late
ness of the season. A number
of owners have lost cattle, some
of them dying from the lack of
sufficient forage growth on the
ranges. It is hoped that the
mesquite bushes, which are be
ginning to put out, win relieve
the situation until the rains and
warmer weather cause grass
and vegetation to come out and
restore normal conditions. Ben

THERE IS NO FOOD SHORTAGE.
All this stillyrot about short
age of foodstuff in this country
is circulated either jay the ignor
ant which comprises fully half
the people, or it is advertised by
designing food speculators.
There is plenty of wheat to last
until harvest. In fact harrest
is now beginning in Texas and
southern states and it will be
but a lew weeks until Oklahoma
will be threshing grain. Within
sixty days most of the winter
wheat will be cut. It is estimat
ed by conservative government
experts that there will be 2,000,
000,000 bushels of surplus
wheat this year when the spring
wheat crop is harvested. The
shortage can exist only in the
amount of export wheat. The
same may be said of every other
kind of product. The United
States will have plenty and to
spare. We may not be able to
supply all demands or fill every
order but that there will be a
great abundance, is assured.
The farmers of the nation are
alert and any and all crops that
bid fair to find a market, will be
produced. In the meantime, swat

REGISTRATION DAY.
On Junej5th AIIJAmericans Between
21 and 31 Must .Register.
June 5. the day of registration
named by President Wilson in
his proclamation in which he
quotes sections 5 and G the army
bill specifies that all men shall
register in the precincts wherein
they have their homes. All men
between the acres of 21 and 31
must register. Registration shall
be between the hours of 7 a. m.
and 9 p. m. "The power against
w,hich we are arrayed has sought
to impose his will upon the world
force," the proclamation de
clares. "To the end it has increased
its armament until it changed
the face of war. In the sense in
which we have been wont to
think of armies, there are no
armies in this struggle. There
are entire nations armed, thus,
men who remain to till the soil
are no less part of an army in
France than the men beneath
the flag. It must be so with us.
It is not an army that we must
shape and train for war, it is a
nation. To this end our people
must draw close in one compact
front against a common foe. All
must pursue one purpose. The
nation needs all men, but it
needs each man, not in the field
that will please him, but in the
endeavor that will best serve
the common good."
Immediately after signing the
army bill President Wilson
directed that an expeditionary
force of approximately one divi
sion of regular troops under
command of General John J.
Pershing proceed to France at
as early a date as practicable.
LOCAL ITEMS.

The accidental killing of little
four-year-old Georgia Gonzales,
last Sunday afternoon, by an

An unconfirmed report was
received in Nogales the forepart
of the week to the effect that
Henry Bartning, formerly local

Friends of Edward Titcomb,
president of the Nogales Rifle
Club, and Edward J. Ralph,
customs broker, who have gone
to San Francisco to make a final
effort to enter the officers' train
ing camp, hope they'll be suc
cessful. If given a chance, both
will make good in the service of
Uncle Sam.
Colonel George Beebe, form
erly of Elgin, this county, ac
companied by Mrs. Beebe, is a

Last Wednesday United States

Board upon its arrival here next
Monday. Today committees ap
pointed at last night's meeting
are busy as bees, and splendid

NO FAVORITES.
An Associated Press dispatch,
from San Francisco, dated May
16th, and received by the Herald
says:
"Army authorities today said
they had received many letters
from rejected candidates and
said further that no favoritism
was shown. It is utterly untrue
that some candidates failed be
cause examining officers bungled
the records. Many were reject
ed because they attempted un
successfully to get in through
political on other influence."

Test fer Gasoline
Thf: specific gravity test is worthless,
as a test of gasoline quality.
So says the U. S. Bureau of Standards.
Boiling points comprise the only real test, be
cause easy starting, quick acceleration, maxi
mum power.depend absolutely on boiling points.
The gravity-hydrometer tells you nothing about
the boiling points of gasoline.
RY&P CROWN
ihe Gesome o Quai(y
is straight - distilled, and thus has its boiling
points in z. gradually rising, unbroken chain
low boiling points for easy starting, medium
bctling points for quick and smooth acceleration,
high boiling pointc for power and mileage
No mixture can contain an unbroken chain of
boiling points the hundreds of intermediate
points are' missing. Be sure and get Red Crown.
It's pure gcsoline not a mixture.
