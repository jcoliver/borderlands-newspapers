Lest there should be some who
think the oil boom is dead in
this locality, it may be stated
that the men behind the project
are still working to make it a go.
The delay in getting a sufficient
amount of land signed up to
justify the installation of ex

held back operations. However
some considerable acreage has

Work on the highways and
bridges of Arizona should not be
discontinued during the war, but
should be actively prosecuted,
according to Governor Thomas
E. Campbell in a communication
to Thomas Maddock, state en
gineer. Governor Campbell de
clares that in his judgement
there should be no cessation in
the proper maintenance of the
highways of the state until the
price of raw material reaches a
prohibitive figure. The surplus
of labor in the mining camps al
so could be well utilized in road
work, tne governor declares.

A PATRIOTIC APPEAL.
The Arizona Council of De
fense and the United States Pood
Administration join in the fol
lowing resolution, which is given
publicity throughout the state to
encourage increased production
of wheat as a patriotic service:
Whereas, it appears from the
survey recently completed by
the Arizona Council of Defense
of all foods and feed grown in
Arizona that the quantity of
wheat is far below the consump
tion of this product in this state;
and
WHereas, we feel this is in a
sense a reflection upon the pa
triotic citizenship of Arizona
which has never failed in re
sponding to any call made by
our government; and resolution,
which is given publicity
Whereas, in order that Ariz
oca may be relieved from a place
in the class which consumes in
excess of production a commo
dity which our government is
depending upon as a vital ele
ment in winning the war with
Germany; and
Whereas, the government
fully realizes the dire need of
our allies for more wheat, and
to stimulate production in Amer
ica, has guaranteed to all pro
ducers a minimum price of 'two
dollars a bushel for 1918 wheat
at primary terminal markets,
which we are advised by a re
presentative of a bureau of mar
kets should be equivalent to a
price of approximately three
dollars and fifty cents per nun
dred pounds on wheat of the
quality of Early Baart, f. o. b.
Phoenix, or Tucson, Arizona.
Now, therefore, we believe
it the patriotic duty of the farm
ers of Arizona to release to the
government for use to our allies
and our soldiers in Europe addi
tional wheat tothe extent of
one-half million bushels. This
means an increased acreage
within the state of fifteen thous
and acres, or an increase of fifty
per cent in the present acreage
in this vital crop. Fortunately,
we find that there is within the
state an ample quantity of first
class seed to cover the need of
this production.
All farmers are urged as indi
vidual service to their country
in its time of need to plant
wheat even though it be but a
small plat. In many sections of
this state this planting must be
done within the next thirty days.
We realize that in asking the
farmers of Arizona to perform
this patriotic duty, they may
sometimes fprego a greater pro
fit which could be made in other
crops, but we are convinced that
they will respond to this appeal
in a spirit of patriotic duty - and
show Arizona squarely behind
the government and our boys at
the front.

TO FLY AFTER CATTLE.
Cattle ranching on the South
west plains with airplanes was
the suggestion made by B. F.
Panky of Lainy, N. M., who is
the owner of one of the biggest
cattle ranches in the southwest.
In an interview given out at El
Paso this week Panky said the
airplane could be used to great
advantage in making a general
inspection of the wide range
country, much of which was im
passible to automobiles, and add
ed that transportation by horses
was too slow for the modern cat
tle industry. He said he has
given an order for an airplane
to be constructed according to
his special needs and which he
will use on his New Mexico
ranches. Exchange.
With an average of one bond
purchaser to every three and a
half individuals, Pinal county
led the nine northern counties
of Arizona, and undoubtedly the
rest of the state as well in the
recent Liberty Loan campaign.
The official report, recently com
piled, shows that. Pinal county's
subscription of $700, 150 was dis
tributed among 2,01 individuals.

tions which will place the men

ors are to be made.

der, the following State central

OF INTEREST TO REGISTRANTS
Local Board for the County of
Santa Cruz, State of Arizona,
Nogales. Arizona.
November 30th, 1917.
All Boards:
Please note the following in
structions of Provost Marshal
General :
"Please cause the broadest
and most extensive and con
tinuous publicity to be given
through the. Adjutant General,
Local and District Boards, the
newspapers and by all possible
means of warning to all regis
trants who may have changed
their place of abode and Post
Office address to communicate
immediately with their Local
Boards where they are register
ed and furnish their present
addresses so that questionaires
which will begin to be mailed
December 15th, will reach such
registrants without delay. Re
gistrants are bound by law to
keep themselves advised ot all
proceedings in respect to them
and failure to do so may result
in their losing right to claim
exemption or discharge.
"Please request newspapers
to give this warning broad and
continuous publication from this
time until the process of mailing
questionares has been accom
plished." (Signed) Cuowdek."
no news from the soldier
means that he is all right.
Although the failure to receive
letters from men in the service
is not pleasant to relatives and
friends at home the adage "no
news is goods news" never was
more true than at present. The
report of every casualty at home
or abroad is immediately wired
or cabled to officials at Wash
ington, being relayed from there
without loss of time of the emer
gency address of the soldier or
sailor affected. It is also at once
released for publication in the
newspapers. No news of casu
alties has or will be held up.
No man in the service has re
ceived orders not to write home;
he has been urged, on the con
trary, to keep in touch with re
latives and friends. The forces
in France ha ve at their disposal
post cards giving general infor
mation in regard to health and
the receipt of letters and par
cels, which may be dispatched
without payment of postage.
Care is also taken to see that
mail intended for soldiers and
sailors reaches them promptly.
Where the regimental and com
pany designation of a soldier is
not known it may be secured by
application to The Adjutant
General's Office, Washington, D.
C. In one week 1,674 letters
with insufficient addresses were
received at this office. On 1,232
the addresses were completed
and they were forwarded, 123
were returned to senders, 58
went to the dead-letter office be
cause senders' addresses were
not given, and the balance were
held with the view, that the ad
dresses might be completed later.
A VICIOUS RUMOR.
"Among the many absurd and
vicious rumors put into circula
tion these days, probably through
pro-German influences, is one
that the United States proposes
to confiscate money on deposit
in banks. The absurdity of the
statement is obvious on its face.
These rumors are wholly with
out foundation and probably cir
culated for an evil purpose. The
government has no power to
confiscate the money of deposit
ors in banks." From statement
of Secretary McAdoo.

mann made a canvass of the
main streets of Nogales today,
talking war saving certificate
and thrift stamps He has tine
success and is satisfied thai
when the citizens get the war
savings habit, the campaign for
saving certificates and war
stamps will "go over big" in
Nogales.
Of the first twenty persons
approached by Postmaster
Schuckmann to purchase war
saving certificates, every one
responded. All that I need is the
time to crefc about and I will sell
forty daily," said Postmaster
Schuckmann.
Joe Berk of the Modern store
has the right idea and it is a
bully one for all firms to follow.
Mr. Berk took a $5.00 saving
certificate for eVery employe iu
his store, paying for the same
and allowing his employees to
reimburse him a little at a time.
Such schemes as inaugurated by
Mr. Berk promdte the saving
habit among the clerks and is
what the government is aiming
at.
Postmaster Sshuckmann visit
ed the public schools and at a
conference with Superintendent
of Schools Madden it was agreed
that a campaign for thrift stamps
would be inaugurated among the
school children. It is to be hoped
that the parents of children aid
in starting the campaign which
means mush to the children in
addition to helping the govern
ment. Herald.

A. F. Kerr, the president and
Mr. Gillespie, but Mr. Land
continues a stockholder and will
remain a member of the
directorate.

Father Van Goethen in London.
In a card addressed to the
management of the Airdome
Theatre, Father Van Goethen
gives -a short description of an
air raid on London. The following
is his card:
Dear Friends: By November
1st I was in the capital of Bel
gium, "le Havre" and in Paris.
London was raided during the
two nights I spent there. It
was a sad sight to see the great
city turned into complete dark
ness and thousands of people, I
among them, flocking to the tun
nels for safety. Children and
women were crying, even faint
ing through fear. It was a sight
I will never forget. Pray for
me. Love to all.

Telling Points in Wilson's Address.
"The intolerable wrongs done
and planned against us by the
sinister masters of Gemany, have
- , . , i
long since oeeome too grossly
obvious and odious to every true
American to need to be rehears
ed." "Our object is, of course, to
win trie war and we shall not
slacken or suffer ourselves to be
diverted until it is won."
"We know what the price of
peace will be. It will be full,
unpartial justice to our enemies
as well as our friends."
"Autocracy must be shown
the utter futility of its claims to
power or leadership in the mo
dern world."
"Our present and immediate
task is to win the war and noth
ing shall turn us aside from it
until it is accomplished."
"We intend no wrong against
the German empire nor interfer
ence with her internal affairs."
"The hand of God is laid upon
the nations. He will show them
favor, I devoutly believe, only
of the rise to the clean heights
of His own justice and mercy."

Surely it will do for you
what it has done for so

"I was taken sick,

writes Airs. Mary E. Veste,

"I got down so weak,
could hardly walk . . .
just staggered around.
... I read of Cardui,
and after taking one bot
tle, or before taking quite
all, I felt much better. I
took 3 or 4 bottles at
that time, and was able to
do my work. I take it in
the spring when run
down. I had no appetite,
and I commenced eating.
It is the best tonic I ever
saw." Try Cardui.
