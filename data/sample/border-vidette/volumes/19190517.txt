Items of Interest Culled From Our

EarlJC. Patterson, formerly
located at the Three R mine, is
now employed by the Evans
Mercantile Company in Patago
nia. Thecommanding officer at Ari-var-a
appeared before the Board
6f Supervisors at their last re
gular meeting, asking for road
improvement work. TKe road
near Arivaca Creek is becoming
impassable for army trucks.
The U. S. government spends
about ' $8000 per month in Tuc
son for supplies for troops sta
tioned at Arivaca.
Mayor Corpstein, City Mana
ger Thompson and the city com
missioners of Phoenix, have
been cited to appear before the
state corporation commission to
show cause why they should not
be punished for contempt for
the alleged failure to carry out
the orders of the state commis
sion in reference to water ser
vice to points outsWe the city
limits.
At last Arizona is on a penny
basis. A long time ago the old
timers viewed with alarm the
cutting down of the price of
drinks from two bits to a bit.
The country was beginning to
be settled. Then came five cent
beer; then near bear, and pretty
soon no beer. The country is
settled. The cent is here to
stay. We are down as low as
we can get.
After inspecting the prelimin
ary lines of the projected Ben
son road, I. P. Fraizer, division
engineer for this district, under
the highway department, stated
Wednesday that he believed the
the road could be finished for
150,000. . The road as outlined
leaves the Empire ranch six
miles east of Vail and passes by
the Pantano station of the El
Paso & Southwestern after it
crosses the wash on a high
bridge.
Never in the history of Casa
Gande has there been such a
building boom, barring, of course,
the reconstruction of Main street
after the fire, in the spring of
1915. Everywhere throughout
the little mainline city buildings
are going up, foundations lor
other buildings are being laid
and plans being" drawn up for
bungalows to rent. Casa Grande
is the place to come and put your
money into city improvements.
Casa Grande Bulletin.
Among the lists of names in the
American army during the war
those who answered to the name
of Smith numbered the most.
These totaled over 51.000. Sec
ond on the list stood the John
sons who numbered 29,000.
Joneses and Greens tallied each
22,500. There were 9,000 Browns
and 4,500 Cohens. Seventy-four
George Washingtons were re
gistered, 79 Robert E. Lees and
two Abraham Lincolns. There
were also two Caesars and one
Woodrow Wilson.
The department of the interior
has proposed to erect commun
ity buildings throughout the
country as memorials to the Am
erican boys who gave their lives
for their country in the great
war. The erection of stone mon
uments or elaborately carved
shafts for this purpose is disap
proved. These would be suit
able for a cemetery, it is said; a
memorial for the men who fell
in Prance will not be erected to
mark where they lie but to pre
serve their memories.
It is reported on reliable au
thority that a shortage of ap
proximately 20,000 Mexican
currency, has been uncovered in
the Mexican customs depart
ment at Agua Prieta,and the
work of placing the responsibili
ty for the missing money is now
under way. One of the em
ployes of the customs depart
ment was arrested Tuesday and
is being held pending further
investigation. An effort is be
ing made to recover the embez
zled money, but it is feared this
will not meet with much success,
though it is believed the guilt
will be fastened on the proper
person or persons.

and will be the most important
step forward in the general civil

LEAGUE COVENANT HAS TEETH
In a copyrighted editorial in
the Philadelphia Public Ledger,
former President Taft shows
that the covenant of the league
of nations is strong and enforce
able, and in no wise contravenes
the policies or interests of the
United States.
Regarding the misconception
to which critics of the covenant
have given currency, Mr. Taft
said :
"The attitude of those who
favor the covenant has been mis
construed, increasing the con
fusion in the mind of the public
inrespect to the inestimable value
of the covenant as it is. Were
the alternatives presented ex
actly as it is, or of postponing
the coming of peace and continu
ing the state of war until the
conference could reconvene and
make other provisions for peace,
I should without the slightest
fear as to the complete safety of
my country under its provisions
vote for it as the greatest step
in the betterment of interna
tional relations for the benefit of
the people of the world and for
the benefit of my country in re
corded history".
Answering the contention that
the covenant is without provi
sion for enforcement, Mr. Taft
continued:
"The proposed league has real
teeth and a bite to it. It fur
nishes real machinery to organ
ize the power of the peaceful
nations of the world into econo
mic and military action, which
by its very existence and cer
tainty will keep nations from
war and will force them to the
acceptance of a peaceable settle
ment. This will dispense with
the necessity for the exercise of
economic pressure or force."
FAITH IN THE FUTURE
Mining men are not discour
aged by the unfavorable condi
tions of the past several months.
They are looking for a great
expansion soon of the mining in
dustry of the United States.
Mine owners of the Southwest
are confidently expeeting a re
vival of the mining industry on
a big scale. They are basing
their conclusions on reports
brought by several operators
who have recently returned from
New-York and who have peen
in touch with some of the leading
metal men of the nation.
Gold has practically gone ont
of circulation, and silver now Js
hbout as precious a metal ms
gold, from a monetary atand
point, because of the double
standard. It is a question if there
is enough gold and silver com
bined to go around.
It is claimed that there is less
real metal in this country today,
in proportion to the outstanding
obligations than there was in
George Washington's time after
the rerolutionary war, and then
there was practically none.
Mining men predict as a re
sult the coming of a period of
mining expansion based upon
the world-wide search, probably
in many cases financed by gov
ernments, for properties which
will produce precious metals.
The mines of Arizona will feel
the impetus when the combing
process for mines begins and
Eastern capital, which is already
looking to the Southwest for in
vestment, starts flowing this
way. Patagonian.
Something like 9400 foreign
medals have been awarded to
members of the American expe
ditionary forces. More than
8000 of these were French de
corations, the remainder being
about equally divided between
British and Belgian decorations.
