nut acreage this year has grown
to 1,000. The product is con

Plans under which all wound

lities to care for 101,281 men.
Fifty thousand men are expect

as each war savings stamp so

That the teachers of public
schools in Arizona which have
been closed for so many weeks
on account of the epidemic of
Spanish influenza should receive
full pay, regardless of whether
the schools were open or not, is
the opinion of C. O. Case, state
superintendent of publ'c instruc
tion, and that he also believes
that the laws of the state pro
vide for full payment of salaries,
will be good news to the many
teachers who have been serious
ly inconvenienced through the
closing of the schools and the
nonpayment the salaries.

ployed by the Arizona Anti
Tuberculosis association as state
survey nurse. Mrs. Lane has
been prominent in survey work
in different points of Arizona in
connection with the influenza
epidemic. Through house to
house visits she lias been able
to get a fairly accurate idea of
the amount of influenza existing
in the community, and has re
commended the measures most
needed locally in abating this
disease. Under her direction
spraying stations have been
opened, serum treatments have
been given, emergency hospitals
have been started and unsanit
ary conditions have been brought

MAY LOSE CONSIDERABLE.
Details of the plans for gov
ernment purchase from dealers
of surplus stocks of wheat flour
substitutes were made public
yesterday by the federal food
administrator for Arizona.
Incidentally, it was revealed
that Arizona dealers stand to
sustain a considerable loss.
While this is regretted by the
food administration, officials point
out thae this was unavoidable, in
face of the sudden change of
conditions attendant upon the
signing cf the armistice, and
Arizona merchants were called
upon to make this additional
sacrifice as a matter of patriotic
duty.
Under the plan of purchase of
victory flour and other compul
sory wheat flour substitutes, the
cereal division offers the follow
ing prices for stocks delivered
in carload quantities at seaboard :
Victory flour $10.50; barley
flour, $8 straight; or patent rye
flour $9; dark rye flour $7.50;
white corn meal flour $8.50; yel
low corn meal flour $8; cream
corn meal $8; other corn meal
$7.50; but in no case higher than
actual invoice cost, plus freight.
With Galveston and San Fran
cisco named as the nearest point
of delivery for Arizona, it is
patent that Arizona dealers will
stand a loss in making shipment
of substitutes. It is, therefor,
suggested that they reduce prices
on victory and other substitute
stocks, thus giving the public
advantage even though loss may
be incurred, and thereby dispose
of stocks more readily than
through sale to the government.
Many dealers have already
taken this course. It is believ
ed that all stocks of substitutes
including victory flour can be
disposed of with slight loss,
within thirty days if this plan is
carried out.- Prospector.
CONDITIONS IMPROVE.
The weather bureau reports:
Generally fair weather and mod
erate temperatures have prevail
ed over all parts of the district
and have been favorable for all
livestock. Light to heavy show
ers occurred in all sections near
the end of the week, resulting
in the replenishment of the wat
er supply to satisfactory extent.
Rainfall was particularly heavy
on the higher elevations, in the
Apache Indian Reservation, and
in western New Mexico. The
increased water supply has re
sulted in the extension of the
grazing area, relieving the more
or less crowded sections near
established water tanks.
Shipments to market continue
and some movement to Califor
nia and Mexico to feed. A mod
erate number are also being put
on pasture in Mohave county
where conditions are exception
ally favorable. The Arizona

ARIZONA MAKES GOOD.
Figures heretofore made pub

They embraced only subscrip

quarters in San Francisco. Only
now are the complete figures
available, here given for the
first time.
Southern district Cochise

Northern district, 9,286,550;
Arizona total subscription, $15,

Overshadowing :;!1 other nccoinpltsh
ments of ill' American people under
Ihe leadership of Food Administration
Is the history of wheat export In tho
past sixteen months. Our wheat ex
port progi in proved conclusively to
the world that America was lu this
war from start to nnteh and willing to
make any sacrifice that will hasten
victory or maintain the health and
strength of people overseas, upon
whom rested the heaviest weight of
our war.
Now thru pressure on ocean tonnage
Is f axed by the stopping of large movement.-;
of troops to Europe, we may re
lax our efforts to save wheat, 'i'lm ac
cumulated surplus In Australia, Argen
tine and other hitherto Inaccessible
markets will become available, and
probably no more than our normal sur
plus will have lo leave this country.
Wc In America snd ihe nations which
have won the world for freedom will
be enabled to eat their normal wheat
loaf at Ihe common table of the peo
ples of democracy.
We entered the past crop year with
ft wheat supply which gave us only
20.000.000 bushels available for ex
port. When the crop year ended, we
had sent 1-1 1 .(Hx,(KX bushels of wheat
to Europe. The American people had
saved out of their normal consumption
121,000,000 bushel.
A survey of export figures shows
that the eoiiHervatlon of flour brought
about by die W be ties meals, wheat
less days. Mjbst i t ui Ion In our kitchen
and bakeries, enabled us to send to
our armies and Ihe allies 38,000,000
barrels of white Hour wheat figured
as flour. Mail we exported only our
vlsiblu surplus, we would have been
able to ship less than 4,900,000 barrels.
Before ihe 1st of December our sur
plus had gone overseas', and an addi
tional .'h;,O00,O0 bushels had been tak
en from the slock reserved for home
consumption and added to Ihe surplus
already shipped to the allies. It seem
ed hardly possible that we could bring
our total export above ItJO.OtiO.OOO
bushels by July 1. Bui In January the
late Lord Kbondda. then British Food
Controller, cabled that uulcss wo
could send mi additional 7.0O0,00O
bushels he could not take responsi
bility for assuring his people that they,
would he fed. The American people
responded by sending So.ooo.tsio bush
els of wheat, saved from their horn
consumption, between the first of tho
year and Hi ad vein of the new crop.
By October 10, 1018, We had already,
hipped 0.1,900,303 bushels since July
1. Absolutely the only limitation upon
our wheat exports since the latest har
vest has been the scarcity of ocean
tonuuge. If exports continue at th
present rate, by July 1 of next year
we will have sent more than lt-".7,."00,-uuo
bushels to Europe.
Thus are we making good America's
pledge that the bread rations of Allied
Europe shall he maintained.

shows that even In ihe enemy
country clear thinking students
did not undervalue the strength
of the American republic. Only
in Ills confidence that we could
not land In Europe sufficient

was this German mistaken.

Mm
Says G5 year CU Kentucky Lady. Who Tells How She Was Relieved
After a Few Dosea of Slack-Draught.
Meadorsville, Ky. Mrs. Cynthia
Higginuotham, cf thi3 tov.-n, says: "At
my age, which is 65, the liver does
not act so well as when youns. A few
years ago, my stomach was all out of
fix. I was constipated, my liv.-r
didn't act. My digestion was bad, and
it look so little to tippet ine. My ap
pctUe wa3 gone. I v.-.-.n very wc-ah...
I decided I would give Black
I3rsught a thorough trial as I knew It
was highly recommended for this
trouble. I began tah.ng it. I felt
better after a few dotes. My appetite
improved and I became stronger. My
bowels acted naturally and the least
trouble was poon rSsbted with a few
dopes of Black-Draught."
Seventy years of successful use htl
made Thedford's Black-Draught a
standard, household remedy. Every
member, of every family, at times,
need the heir that Black-Draught can
give in cleansing tho system and re
lieving the troubles that come from
constipation, indigestion, lazy liver,
etc. You cannot keep well unless your
stomach, liver and bowels are in good
working order. Keep them that way.
Try Black-Draught. It acts promptly
gently and in a natural way. If you
feel sluggish, take a dose tonight.
You will feel fresh tomorrow. Price
