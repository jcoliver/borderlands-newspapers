THE HOPE OF THE WORLD.
The hope of the world hangs
on the League of Nations bound
up in the Peace Treaty.
For the first time in the human
story many diverse peoples have
come together, and, dropping
their differences, have agreed
upon a plan to attain and to
keep the boon of peace.
All the details of that plan
may not be perfectly wise. In
so great and so new an experi
ment they could not be so or
could not to all minds seem so.
But they have agreed, these
peoples; they have united in a
solemn protest against the sav
agery of war, they have entered
into a solemn covenant for peace,
good will and progress.
There has never been anything
else so good in man's affairs,
nor so full of promise. It is, in
effect, the formal recognition of
the supremacy of love over hate,
of friendship over force.
To peck and pick at this great
document, to sniff and sneer, to
go over it with microscopes ard
test tubes seeking to find flaws
to shriek against, is at this junc
ture of the struggle for right
eousness sorry business for an
American.
What defects the plan may
have will be developed when it
is put to work. No human in
tellect is wise enough to say in
advance what these will be.
The whole thing is experiment.
Changes can be made as prac
tice shows them to be needed.
But for these days the duty is
clear. If the Senate shall reject
the treaty or tinker it or serious
ly amend it, then the United
States of America stands in the
position of striking to earth the
aspirations of mankind for a
greater unity, closer ties, better
understanding, warmer friend
ship. After the world's terrible trav
ail,' after all the blood and hor
rors, darkened homes and ruin
ed lives that we have seen to be
the product of hate, men that
can lift hand against any testa
ment of good will, no matter
how defective, seem the incom
prehensible marvels of the age

THE AMERICAN LEGION.
As America had its Grand
Army of the Republic after the
Civil War, so it has the Amer
ican Legion a national organiz
ation of American veterans of
the World War.
The spirit behind the Legion
is distinctly the American spirit.
Every one of its members serv
ed the nation in war with only
one thought.to protect this land.
Those who now sleep in France
fought to protect and save Am
erica. To save England was to
save America. There was no flag
of the League of Nations none
but the Stars and Stripes. On
the battle front and in the camps
and trenches there was just one
thought whip the Germans and
then avenge the sinking of the
Lusitania, and save America.
The same spirit which inspir
ed the soldiers in war inspires
them in peace. The American
Legion typifies patriotism. To
that organization the United
States comes first. It is worthy
of confidence and support of all
Americans New York Herald.

Popular Santa Cruz County Cowman
Weds California Lady.
The friends of the genial cat
tleman, Tom Gumming (and the
expression embraces nearly
every man, woman and child in
Santa Cruz county,) will be sur
prised to learn that at Tucson,
yesterday evening, the gentle
man was united in matrimony
with Miss Josephine Sykes from
Berkeley, California, the beauti
ful university town of Califor
nia, where the lady was born
and reared, says the Thursday
morniug's Oasis.
Yesterday morning Mr. Cum
ming went to Tucson, meeting
his bride upon her arrival from
her home yesterday afternoon
and at evening they were united
in holy wedlock by Rev. W. J.
Dixon of Grace church. They
will arrive at Nogales this morn
ing on the train from "ye old
pueblo."
The wedding now announced
is the culmination of an acquaint
ance of three years, the ac
quaintance ripening into love
and matrimony. As stated above
the lady is a native of Califor
nian. The groom is a native of No
gales, his parents having been
early pioneer residents here and
he has lived in what is now
Santa Cruz county. He is head
of the firm of Cumming Broth
ers, a well known trio of cattle
raisers in the Santa Cruz Valley;
and he was one of the Santa
Cruz county contingent in the
big war, "going "over there"
with the 158th Infantry, in which
Arizona organization he attained
the rank of sergeant in the sup
ply company and in I Company
with the regiment he saw sev
ere service and acquitted himself
gallantly. It is but a few weeks
since be returned from France
and to civil life. He is a 32nd de

In their new relation Mr. and
Mrs. Cumming carry the best
wishes of a host of friends.

weakness and dizziness,
. . . and the pains were
very severe. A friend
to d me I had tried every

Cardui ? . . T I did, and
