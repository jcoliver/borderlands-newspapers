ARIZONA'S LEADING CITY.
Phoenix, Arizona, is the most
prosperous city of its class, in
the entire southwest. The Pirn
cotton industry is largely re
sponsible but Salt River valley
is also rich in fruits, grain, al
falfa and dairy stock, there be
ing at least 79,000 head of dairy
stock in the valley.
Located far distant from any
of the cantonments, there has
been do war stimulus Hun
dreds of young men have joined
the colors and more are to fol"
low. Phoenix has a population
of 30,000 inhabitants and is one
of the cleanest and best govern
ed cities in the United States.
The climate is conducive to al
most continuous farming. Two
crops of grain or six of alfalfa
can be grown annually. The
city is well advertised by the
tourists that spend the winters
here and by our home people
who travel much during the
summer months of July and
August.
It is not so hot as to make it
necessary to leave but most peo
ple earn enough in ten months
to be able to take a vacation.
This naturally is taken during
the so called heated term. The
city is growing by leaps and
bounds, yet not booming. It
will soon be double its present
size. The Messenger.
USE MORE RICE.
Rice is one of the best sub
stitutes to use in preparing
wheatless and meatless meals.
Because it has little individual
flavor it takes on the taste of
the dish with which it has been
combined.
This quality makes rice an ex
cellent foundation for milk and
cheese dishes, or combination
with meat, chicken or fish.
Rice can be combined with
any vegetable, made into a va
riety of deserts, used to thicken
soups or mixed with wheat flour
or corn meal in making bread.
Even a spoonful left over can
be stirred into bread, mixed in
chicken stuffing or dropped in
the soup pot. Left over rice
may be browned in fat for break
fast or made into cakes by add
ing eggs, a little milk, flour to
thicken and a teaspoon of baking
powder. Try these rice cakes
for breakfast with syrup.
THE MAN WHO LOSES.
We heard that old, old chest
nut again the other dav: "Yes,
ybut I know a man who lost a lot
of money in mining." The say
ing is about on a par with that
other once popular fallacy:
''More money is put into mining
than is ever taken out."
We. all know men and women
who have lost money in mining.
We also know people who have
lost money in every human pur
suit and in every industry, great
and small. We know people
who would lose in any venture;
people who have the not uncom
mon faculty of getting rid of
money and who will back any
grafter who comes along, no
matter how transparent his
Same. We have losta lew hard
earned dollars ourselves, on
smoke consumers, etc.
The reason is lack of judg
ment the inability to discrimi
nate between the wheat and the
chaff between the honest man
and the rogue. Because we
bought stock in a smoke con
sutner company which did not
exist, is no reason why we should
condemn the manufacturing in
dustry. Because our frieud
Jones made a failure of farming
is no reason to suppose that all
farms are failures. Neighbor
Johnson, who entered the mer
chandising business, also went
broke. However, we do not con
demn the practice of buying
goods and selling them at a
profit, except as the high cost of
living hits us personally. And
Smith, across the street, put the
money his father left him into a
bank venture. He lost it, and
the failure was b'amei to a dis
honest cashier, though most of
us know bettar. But none of us
lambast the banking business
for Smith's failure.
Mining seems to be the only
industry which is condemned be
cause people have lost money in
it. And yet mining, when con
ducted along business lines and
by hard headed men of experi
ence, has been proven time and
again to contain less hazard
than many of the so called con
servative industries. The fact
is when a man enters mining he
is playing for Dig stakes. If he
makes good, his gains are enor
mous and out of all proportion
to the money invested originally.
And it is this phase which gives
it its fascination and which im
pels people to speculate without
proper investigation.
The successful man, with
money to back his judgment,
who invests in mining with the
same care, the same cautious in
vestigation, that he displays in
other investments, invariably
makes good money .from the
industry. It is never said of
him that "he lost money in min
ing." On the other hand, the
pursuit of the precious and base
metals has made more wealthy
men of struggling laborers, than
any other line of human en
deavor.
Nevertheless, the censure di
rected against mining because
of the man who lost, is out of
all proportion to the grudging
credit which is accorded it be
cause of the many who have
won. Salt Lake 'Mining Review.
JUVENILE PATRIOTISM.
The school children of Okla
homa have a pledge all their
own, that might be adapted for
the use of Arizonans. It is: "I
hereby pledge renewed allegi
ance to my flag and to the re
public for which -it stands. I
pledge myself as a true, loyal
American to be active in support
of my government in all its plans
and efforts. I will help stamp
out the enemies at home, whose
every act or word means more
graves in Prance. I recognize
the danger from the slacker. I
realize that every breeder of se
ditiou is as great a menace to
our homes and freedom as our
enemies across the sea. I there
fore pledge myself to report any
disloyal act or utterances that
comes to my knowldge."

OUR GREAT MINING INDUSTRY
Mining is one of the West's
most important industries and
the following figures of produc
tion in a few western states for
1917 offer the best arguments
for state and national policies
encouraging to increased pro
duction. Utah's total mineral produc
tion for 1918 was about $115,000,
000 principal output.
Wyoming - produced $80,394,
610 with oil and coal in the lead.
Nevada, $53,000,000 with cop
per and gold leading.
Idaho, $54,000,000 with lead,
sliver and zinc the principal
metals.
California, $11,457,682, princi
pally gold and copper with over
$100,000,000 in oil production.
These figures are simply illus
trative and do not include Ari
zona, which produced nearly
three times as much copper as
Utah, nor Montana, which is one
of the greatest copper states in
the Union, nor New Mexico and
Colorado which are great metal
producers.
It would probably be safe to
say that the eleven states west
of North Dakota and Texas pro
duced nearly $1,000,000,000 in
new mineral wealth in 1917.
When you consider that in
creased production is a vital ne
cessity in carrying on the war, it
is apparent that measures to en
courage the development of the
mining and smelting industry
are important. Miner.
SONORA RANGERS.
A recent press dispatch dated
Douglas, Arizona says:
"Sonora has decided to revive
the old fiscal gendarme system
employed for preventing smug
gling along the border in the
days of Diaz, Mexican Consul
Lelevier announced. General
Kosterlitzky eleven years ago
headed these guards in Sonora,
with his headquarters in Her:
mosillo.
"Headquarters for the new
guard will be in the same place,
which is near the center of the
Sonora boundary on the north
! and therefore most convenient.
Gen. Carlos Plank, a Cananea
man well known here, will be in
command. A force of 300 men
is being recruited. Picked men
are desired, as it is the purpose
to make of it a thoroughly effi
cient force. It will relieve the
line riders and soldiers now used
for this purpose. It probably
means that smuggling things
iu and out of Sonora will be
much more difficult in the future.
Rights of Soldiers to Be Protected
Arizona men who have joined
the colors will not forfeit any of
their rights they may have se
sured in public lands of this
state nor suffer the cancellation
of any certificates of purchase
through default in the payment
of installments.
An opinion to this effect has
been made by Wiley E. Jones,
attorney general, who has re
plied to an inquiry made by Wil
liam A. Moeur, state land com
missioner. The attorney gen
eral advises the land commis
sioner to take no steps against
any of the soldiers in this re
spect. His letter to Mr. Moeur
is as follows:
Hon. W. A. Moeur,
State Land Commissioner,
Phoenix, Arizona.
Dear Sir: I am just in receipt
of your letter of yesterday call
ing my attention to Section 64
of the Public Land Code, pro
viding for the cancellation of
certificates of purchase in the
case of default of payment of
installments.
You ask if Congress has pass
ed an act protecting men in the
service from the cancellation of
any contracts they have made.
I cannot answer this inqury at
this moment, not having such
act of congress, if passed, be
fore me; but, as attorney general
I would suggest, and as a mem
ber of the state land department
I would advise and urgo that no
steps be taken to declare or
claim a default -at this time
against any of our soldiers who
have gone to the European firing
line in obedience to the mandate
of our government. I think
such action as above suggested,
should be taken by the land de
partment as a just and patriotic
course iii encouragement of
those who are performing their
patriotic duty at this hour in the
service of oar country.
Very respectfully,
WILEY E. JONES,
Attorney General.

HEART TO HEART TALK.
Zero Coal Test for Motor Oils of In
terest to Motorists.
The following by P. R. Mel
chert, automobile engineer of the
Standard Oil Company, will be of
interest to readers of The
Border Vidette, who use
lubricating oils:
We know that correct lubtica
tion is the most vital factor in
the operation of a motor car.
During this cold weather we
fiDd that our motors do not
respond as quickly as is the case
during the summer. Lubricating
oil is partly responsible for this
condition. This annoyance of a
sluggish and inefficient motor
can be largely eliminated by the
use of the correct oil.
For correct cold weather
lubrication the Cold Test of a
motor oil is a most important
feature. Upon it depends very
largely the flexibility, power
developed, fuel consumption,
and wear and tear of the motor.
The Cold Test of an oil is the
lowest temprature at which it
will flow; for instance, if an oil
has a Cold Test of 30 it will pour
at that temperature and become
solid about 5 lower.
Oils that congeal when the
wheather is at freezing point, or
at 32 F., are not suitable for
lubrication during cold weather
because the resistance offered to
the sheering of the film is high,
for we learn that the value of a
lubricating oil depends upon its
fluidity at the temperatures at
which it is used; that is, a fluid
oil or one having a good Cold
Tast (preferably Zero) will offer
very much less resistance to the
sheering of the film than a thick
or sluggish oil or one which has
a poor Cold Test and is in the
condition of jelly in the crank
case.
We know that all gasoline
engines start hard in cold
weather because the fuel does
not vaporize as readily at this
time as it does during warm
weather, taxing the batteries to
their limit. If poor Cold Test
lubricating oils are used, the
additional power necessary to
turn the motor over is very
materially increased, which
means rapid draining of the
batteries and, consequently,
expensive upkeep.
Again, if an oil of poor Cold
Test is used or one that con
geals in the oiling system during
these cold mornings, it will not
lubricate the motor correctly
because it is too thick or slug
gish to pass between the close
fitting bearings, and if used in a
motor which is partly or wholly
lubricated by splash, this oil will
not be splashed to the cylinders,
pistons, and wrist pains in
sufficient quantities to insure
adequate lubrication until the
motor has been run from 15 to
30 minutes and the temperature
of the motor has thinned the oil
down, during which time exces
sive wear of the moving parts is
taking place which means not
only expensive adjustments and
repairs, but also excessive fuel
consumption, and a sluggish and
inefficient motor.
This also applies to force-feed
oiling systems, for oils of poor
Cold Test offer considerable
resistance to the passing of the
oil through the pipes and hollow
crank shaft to the bearings, and
the oil does not circulate freely
enough until it has thinned
down.
Another condition which
shows the inefficiency of poor
Cold Test oils very plainly to
the operator is the necessity for
frequent gear shifting.
Eastern refiners and motor car
manufacturers recommend light
oils for winter and medium oils
for summer lubrication, realizing
that oils of poor Cold Test can
not be used successfully during
cold weather. They are compell
ed to do this because light East
ern oils have a better Cold Test
than medium-bodied Eastern oils.
Motor oils correctly manufac
tured from California Asphalt
Base Crude have a natural Zero
Cold Test, making them the
correct oil for use at all seasons
of the year.
Using Zero Cold Test oils
gives the necessarry margin of
safety so that during this Cold
Weather there is no danger of
burned out bearings or exces
sive wear of moving parts,
caused by lubricating oil congeal
ing in the ciling system.
ANOTHER PIONEER GONE.
William N. Lester Suffers Stroke of
Paralysis and Dies.
William Noah Lester, well
known pioneer citizen of Nogales,
was striken with paralysis at his
home on Elm street last Friday.
He was immediately taken to
St. Joseph's hospital where
everything possible was done to
save his life which from the first
was despaired of, on account of
the advanced age of the stricken
man, who was 73 years old.
He passed away Wednesday
morning, his son, W. A. Lester,
of California, who with his wife,
arrived Tuesday, being at his
father's bed side when the end
tame
The funeral was held jester
day from Marsh's undertaking
parlors, interment being in the
Old Fellows cemetery. A large
number of friends, many of whom
had known "Bill" Laster since
his coming to Notjales more
than twenty years ago, followed
the remains to their last resting
place.
Since coming to Nogales,
deceased had engaged in the
business of contracting and
building. He was a stone mason
by trade, and was highly
respected by all.
Deceased is survived by two
sons, G. R. and W. A. Lester,
of California; three brothers,
George W., Thomas and Jesse
Lester, and two sister, Hattie
and Anna.
In their loss they have the
sympathy of this community,
where their father and brother
was well known and well liked,
for many years.

MADE THEIR KICK STICK.
At the adjourned meeting of
the Town Council last Thursday
evening, the proposition of cover
ing the town arroyo between
the Crawford and Elm street
bridges, was again taken up,
and it was decided to reject all
bids and readvertise for bids for
covering only that part of the
arroyo south of the Escalada
building to the Crawford street
bridge.
In behalf of protestants, At
torney S. F. Noon appeared be
fore the council and stated that
before submitting to the pro
nosed civic improvements, the
protesting property owners
would carry the matter into
court.
The property owners rom the
south end of the Escalada build
ing do not feel that the improve
ment will justify the price each
would have to pay, hence their
very strenuous objection.
At the meeting held Thursday
evening, uity . Hingineer Liittie
was ordered to complete the
work on Hudgin street, and to
establish the grade on West ave
nue, between Walnut and Oak
streets.

Many thousands of
women suffering from
womanly trouble, have
been benefited by the use
of Cardui, the woman's
tonic, according to letters
we receive, similar to VrAz
one from Airs. Z. V. Spell,
of Hayne, N. C. "1 could
net stand on my feet, and
just suffered terribly,"
she says. "As my suf
fering was so great, and
he had tried other reme
dies, Dr. had us
gel Cardui. . . I began
improving, and it cured
me. 1 know, and my
doctor knows, what Car
dui did for me, for my

about gone."
