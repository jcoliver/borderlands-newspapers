ARIZONA NOTES.
Items of
Interest Culled From Our
Exchanges.
A strike made this week on
the Arizona-European group,
near the Three R, returned re
markably jood assays in copper,
silver and gold. A big crew of
inn are to be pnt at work at
once on development.
Second crop of potatoes that
will keep for winter use will be
planted in Salt River valley about
the middle of August. The crop
will then mature in November
when the weather is cool. The
spring crop is planted in Febru
ary. It is dug in June and at
that season the crop must be
sold or used speedily because of
the heat.
The maximum price of baled
alfalfa in the history of the Ala
mogordo, N. M. section was re
ached the past several months,
when most any kind of hay
brought around $35 per ton in
Alamogordo. The price was
broken considerably when the
new crop was baled and put on
the market. The growers are
realizing $18 per ton now, deliv
ered at warehouse or station.
Old High Cost of Living got
another jolt in the short ribs last
week when the merchants of Ray
held a second meeting within
the past month and lowered the
prices of food stuff. On the
first of June the merchants de
cided to reduce the prices on the
necessities of life and a list of
prices was sent out to the natrons
of the stores announcing the new
prices. Some of the articles
have again been reduced.
Owing to trouble at the power
house in Nogales, forcing a
diminution in the amount of elec
tric power, the oil ilot&tion mill
at the Three R mine was tem
porarily closed down this week.
Only enough power is furnished
to run the pumps and compres
sor, and while awaiting repairs
at the power house, the mine
continues its regular shipments
of high grade ore to the smelter.
Workmen say the 8th level is
opening up in splendid ore.
J. D. Rountree, the well dril
ler, had a narrow escape last
Fnday, when driving down the
big hill at the head of the San
Rafael valley the brake gave
way and the four-horse team
ran off' the grade, throwing Mr.
Rountree under the wagon. The
front wheels of the heavily-loaded
wagon passed over him, but
fortunately no bones were brok
en. He was taken to Patagonia
for medical attention, and re
mained a few days at the Com
mercial Hotel.
Work is progressing rapidly
on the highway between Bisbee
and Tombstone and will be com
pleted to the Government Draw
within a short time. The grad
ing work has been stopped for
the present and the entire crew
is now engaged in the work of
surfacing. No more material is
being hauled from the old Ex
tension dump, as the haul became
too long, and instead surfacing
is now being hauled from a cal
iche bed alongside of the road
about three miles from the pre
sent camp. Prospector.
Plans for the four-day 700-mile
endurance run of Southern Ari
zona motorcyclists have been
completed, and the race will
start from Douglas on the morn
ing of July 1. The race is for a
purse of $600. There are 25 en
trants, among them S. P. Bouch
er, now of Douglas, formerly
of Patagonia, where he was en
gaged in mining at the Mowry
for some time, and J. J. Vestry,
also of Douglas, well known in
the San Rafael valley. Mr.
Boucher, writes The Patagonia,
the racers will be through Pa
tagonia on the 1st of July and
again on the 3rd. All they ask
is plenty of room as they expect
to be "going some." Each rider
must average at least 25 miles
per hour for the entire 700 miles.
Repairs must be made and gas
and oil taken on running time.
The race is limited to Arizona
riders only. Motorcycle men
say this will be the hardest race
ever pulled of in Arizona. Pa
tagonia n .
The shipping of cattle oat of
I parts of Southern Arizona is a
i hard proposition,, especially in
I the Sonoita, San Rafael, Pata
! gonia and Elgin districts. There
are no loading pens at all at Pa
tagonia, where thov are most
I needed, and at Sonoita there are
no telephone nor telegraph con
nections at all. The people down
there certainly need stock yards
and scales at Patagonia. All the
Sonoita and San Rafael valley
people have a two or three days'
drive to Sonoita station, where
things are just as inconvenient
as they possibly can be. It is to
be hoped that the railroad peo
pie will take the matter up at an
early date and put in some good
yards at Patagonia. Arizona

Governor Campbell has named
the following men as a commis
sion on unporm legistration :
Harold Baxter of Phoenix who
succeeds A. A. Worsley of Tuc

the vacancy caused by the re
fusal of W. B. Cleary of Bisbee
to qualify, after being appointed
by Governor Hunt. The com
mission will go to Saratoga, N.

ASSESORS AND SUPERVISORS TO
MEFT AT NOGALES.
The state tax commission has
called a meeting of the county
assessors, members of boards of
supervisors and state tax com
mission to be held in the court
house at Nogales during the
week beginning July 23, at 10
o'clock in the morning.
At this meeting the valuations
on all classes of property in the
state will be discussed; the object
being to gather information
which will aid the state board in
securing a just and equitable
equalization. Unusual import
ance attaches bo the conference
this year in view of the greatly
increased valuations anticipated
on most classes of property.
Formerly the commission has
required the attendance of all
the clerks of the boards of sup
ervisors and ordered that the
assessment rolls of each county
be brought to the meeting, but
this year the commission, as an
experiment, is leaving the clerks
and the rolls at home, thus elim
inating a considerable expense,
which, in the past, has been
the cause of much criticism.
Special invitations have been
issued to the representatives of
nearly every class of property,
but the commission extends a
general invitation to every tax
payer in the state to attend this
conference, as the subjects to be
discussed will be of vital interest
to everyone.
The chamber of commerce and
board of supervisors of Santa
Cruz county are preparing to
make the visit memorable to
those attending the conference
and the commission anticipates
a large attendance. Messenger.

MAKfe PERSONAL APPEAL.
Recruits Asked For the First Arizona
I nfantry .
Governor Campbell, Dwight
I B. Heard Chairman of the Ari
i zona Council of Defense and
I Captain John C. Green way,
Chairman of the Committee on
public defense and security, are
joining in an appeal to the citi
zens of the state to join in a
campaign to recruit the First
Arizona War Infantry to war
strength. They are sending out
a joint personal appeal to four
thousand citizens of the state
asking each to get at least one
credit for the regiment:-
The appeal, which is signed
by all three men is as follows:
''We need your assistance to
bring the First Arizona Infantry
to war strength.
Twelve hundred additional
men are needed between now
and August 5th. Unless these
are supplied the regiment may
be dispersed and the State of
Arizona be without a represen
tative unit in the National A rmy.
"The shortage of time requires
immediate action. Knowing
your public spirit, we appeal to
you to obtain promptly the ten
tative enrollment of at least one
recruit, using the enclosed form.
"Do not confine yourself to
one if you can obtain more, and
if possible please arrange to have
local physician volunteer his
services to make preliminary
physicial examination as per
enclosed sheet.
"We feel that Arizona's good
name is at stake and it will be
an undying disgrace if Arizona
cannot provide at least one re
giment for her country.
"We are writing you this per
sonal letter asking you to do this
especific work as a matter of
national .service, knowing that
we can rely on your prompt ac
tion." MEXICO LED THE WAY SOLVING
FOOD PROBLEM.
The United States is confront
ed by much the same sort of
food problem that was the case
in Mexico City and other centers
of population during the revolu
tion. Steps are being taken in
the former country to regulate
the handling and the prices of
food commodities, but so far as
observation goes the plan, so
successfully followed in the sis
ter republic does not appear as
yet to have been advanced. It
is that of the establishment of
stores under government control,
where food is sold at an advance
over actual cost or just sufficient
to pay the cost of distribution
and handling. The Mexican of
ficials purchased directly from
the farmers, wherever possible
and then sold to all applicants at
rates far below those demanded
by the average dealer. Stocks
of grain, beuns and other arti
cles that were being hoarded
contrary to law were taken over
by the government at cost as
shown by invoices and put on
sale. All wholesalers were re
quired to present documents
showing cost of their various
commodities and were allowed to
sell at a profit of twenty per
cent. Retailers were permitted
to realize a profit of twenty-five
per cent. Price lists were post
ed, giving the maximum rates
chargeable for all commodities,
and those demanding more than
this were punished. Mexican

Test tor Gasoline
"The specific gravity test is worthless,
as a test of gasoline quality."
So says the U. S. Bureau of Standards.
Boiling points comprise- the only real test, be
cause easy starting, quick acceleration, maxi
mum power. depend absolutely on boiling points.
Tbe gravity-hydrometer tells you nothing about
the boiling points of gasoline.
RED CROWN
7c Gasoline of Quay
is straight distilled, and thus has its boiling
points in a gradually rising, unbroken chain
low boiling points for easy starting, medium
boiling points for quick and smooth acceleration,
high boiling points for power and mileage.
No mixture can contain an unbroken chain of
boiling points the hundreds of intermediate
points are' missing. Be sure and get Red Crown.
It's pure gasoline not a mixture.
