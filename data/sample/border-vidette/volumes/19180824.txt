A GRAND SUCCESS.
Nogales, Sonora Chamber of Com
merce Royally Entertain.
The return "Get - Together
Meeting," of the two chambers
of commerce of the line cities,
which was held in Nogales, So
nora, Sunday afternoon, the
commercial body of the sister
city being hosts to the like or
ganization of the Arizona town,
may be tersely described by the
first line of the triple caption to
this article: "A Grand Success."
And, surely, the gentlemen of
the Nogales, Sonora, chamber
showed themselves rare enter
tainers. For their guests they
had planned an elaborate enter
tainment, and everything went
off just as planned; while the
visitors were simply delighted
with the attention given, the
lavishness of the entertainment
and the completeness of the pro
gram. At the time appointed the mem
bers of the Chamber of Com
merce of Noeales, Arizona, gath
ered at the Town Hall, and wait
ing automobiles took them over
to the rooms of the Camara de
Comercio (Chamber of Com
merce) in Nogales, Sonora.
There they found gathered mem
bers of that body. The visitors
were greeted cordially and right
at home.
The gathering was called to
order by General Alvaro Obrti
gon, president of the entertain
ing body, who welcomed the
visitors in an eloquent speech,
in which he touched charmingly
upon the growth of fraternal
feelings between the people of
the two republics, auguring a
continued expansion of that feel
ing through just such gather
ings. A response to the address of
the general was made by Attor
ney S. P. Noon, who spoke Span
ish, and acquitted himself with
credit and to the gratification of
all present.
Then, after a half hour of so
cial conversation the assemblage
was invited to take automobiles,
with which International Street
was lined, which they did. There
were two dozen or more of the
vehicles, and they were filled
comfortably by the gentlemen
embraced in the imposing party.
A tour of the city was made,
all of the principal streets being
traversed; and then the proces
sion made its way to the home
of Mr. A. C. Villasenor, about
two miles south of town, on the
main highway that follows the
line of the railway, where there
was served in Mexican styles a
most delicious barbecue, the
beef being young and tender,
roasted to a turn, while the con
comitants were truly appetizing,
being despatched with a relish
by all. An orchestra discoursed
sweet music and a photographer
got a number of negatives of the
assemblage, from various points
of view. After the savory viands
had been despatched Mr. Prank
Barry made a short and eloquent
address, thanking the hosts for
the fine entertainment given,
and assuring his hearers that all
that had been done was appre
ciated very highly by the guests.
He predicted a bright future for
the two republics with both pop
ulations working in the great
cause of democracy.
To Mr. Barry's address Mr.
Ben Trasvina, vice president of
the Chamber of Commerce of
Nogales, Sonora, responded (in
English), and the gentleman
struck a responsive chord in the
hearts of all by vouchsafing a
prediction that the imaginary
line separating the two nations
will disappear one day in the
mutual understanding and re
gard of the two people, and their
common devotion to the cause
of democracy.
It was now nighfall, and the
assemblage returned to the vari
ous machines, which brought
them back into town, all going
to the Hidalgo Theatre, where
there was exhibited the new and
very interesting cinematogra
phic film, made at the expense
of the state of Sonora, for ex
hibition purposes (in the United
States) depicting life in Sonora,
it resources, its educational in
stitutions, its social diversions.
More than an hour was taken
in presentation of the great at
traction, which was admired by
all and applauded frequently.
That shovn the entertainment
was ejnded, and the guests re
turned to the American side of
the line, all feeling that they
had been entertained most lav
ishly and hospitably. It was a
great success. Oasis.
ARIZONA NOTES.
Items of Interest Culled From Our
Exchanges.
Corporal Harry C. Carpenter,
Phoenix, Arizona, was reported
severely wounded in the second
edition of the days casualty list
for the United States army over
seas, issued by the war depart
ment.' The new state council of de
fense has perfected its organiza
tion in the election as secretary
of Harry R. Tritle, one of the
owners of the Phoenix Gazette.
Chas. S. Greene, who was secre
tary of the old organization, was
asked to remain as assistant sec
retary. Provost Marshal General
Crowder, Wednesday issued an
order requiring ail men attain
ing the age of 21 since June 5,
last, to register. The order was
designed to quickly provide
Class 1 men for the September
draft. It is expected that about
150,00 will fall under this ruling.
Hearing of the demurrers to
indictments of Douglas and Bis
bee men charged with conspir
acy to violate the laws of the
United States in connection with
the deportations last July a year
ago will begin some time this
month at Prescott, where the
federal court is now in session.
Prospector.
In spite of vast outlay for
bonds, War Savings Stamps,
Red Cross and other war work,
New York's State Banks, priv
ate banks and trust companies
had on June 20, $148,000,000
more resources than in 1917.
This means not only general em
ployment but general thrift.
People are saving money. The
good effect of that will last.
The attention of voters is call
ed to the fact that the registra
tion books for the primaries of
next September 10, will close
Friday night, August 30. No
one who has not registered can
vote in the primaries. Both Re
publicans and Democrats owe it
to their country and state to
take interest enough in the prim
aries to express their choice at
the polls.
A summing up of the damage
done by the late storm shows it
to have been confined in this
valley almost wholly to the can
al system and to the farms be
low the Cave Creek and Para
dise valley washes. The canal
breaks will cost about $15,000
and work upon them is being
rushed in order that water can
be furnished the cotton when
needed. Phoenix Gazette.
Because of the order stopping
army recruiting pending the ap
plication of the proposed new
draft law, many New Mexican

Indications of widespread and
systematized propaganda in the
Middle West and in some sec
tions of the West designed to
obstruct the transfer of machin
ists, tooltnakers, and other skill
ed workers to essential war in
dustries have been brought to
the attention of the Unitpd
States Employment Service. It
is not known definitely whether
false rumors circulated among
workingmen are the work of
German propagandists or are
merely due to misunderstanding.
The matter is being thoroughly
investigated.
AMERICAN FOOD
SAVINGS LARGE
United States Sent Allies
141,000,000 Bushels
of Wheat.
CREDIT DUE TO WOMEN.
Allies Got 844,600,000 Pounds Mora
Meat and Fats in 1917-18
Than in Year Before.
In spite of a subnormal food supply
In this country the American people
have been able to ship to the Allies
as well as our own forces overseas
141,000,000 bushels of wheat, besides
844,000,000 pounds of meat, during the
year ending June MO last. This has
been made possible by the whole
souled co-operation of the people,
who, besides practicing self-denial,
have speedeil up production and re
sponded nobly to the appeal from
abroad.
Food Administrator Hoover, In a
letter to President Wilson, gives a
brief summary of the results of food
conservation in the United States and
of the activities of the Food Admin
istration to this end. The conserva
tion measures have been put through
practically on a voluntary basis which
Is regarded as a splendid tribute to
the patriotism of the American people.
Meat shipments were Increased 844,
000,000 pounds during the first liscal
year, as compared with our meat ex
ports during the year before America
entered the war.
"The total value of those food ship
ments," Mr. Hoover wrote I'resident
Wilson, "which were In the main pur
chased through or with collaboration
of the Food Administration, amount
to, roundly, $1,400,000,000 during the
fiscal year."
In 1910-17 the United States sent
the Allies 2.1:5,r0O.0OO pounds of
meat. In 1017-18, with voluntary con
servation practiced In America, and
aided by extra weight of animals, we
sent the Allies 2.011,100,000 pounds of
meat, an increase of 844,GO0.0OO
pounds.
Wheat Saving Enormous.
When the Food Administration be
gan operations in the summer of 1917,
tlds country was facing a large deficit
In wheat. Counting in all carry-over
wheat from the 1910 crop, we had at
the beginning of the 1917 harvest year
Just enough wheat to take care of
America's normal consumption, not a
bushel of surplus.
At the close of the 1917-18 harvest
year the Food Administration's official
reports showed that our total wheat
shipments to the other side had been
141,000,000 bushels. Every bushel
shipped was wheat saved by the
American people from their normal
consumption.
In cereals and cereal products re
duced to terms of cereal bushels our
shipments to Allied destinations were
340.SO0.0O0 bushels, 80.900,000 bushels
more than the amount sent In 191G-17.
Included in these llgures are 13.900,
000 bushels of rye and the 141.000,000
bushels of saved wheat. In addition
we sent the neutrals dependent on us
10,000,000 bushels of prime breadstuffs.
"These figures do not fully convey
the volume of the effort and sacrifice
made during the past year by the
whole American people," the Food Ad
ministrator wrote. "I am sure thnt
all the millions of our people, agricul
tural as well ns urban, who Slave con
tributed to these results should feel
a very definite satisfaction that In a
year of universal food shortages In
the Northern Hemisphere, all of those
people Joined together against Ger
many came through to the new har
vest, not only with health and strength
fully maintained, but with only tem
porary periods of hardship.
"It Is difficult to distinguish be
tween various sections of our people
the homes, public eutlng places, food
trade, urban or agricultural popula
tions in assessing credit for these
results, but no one will deny the dom
inant part of the American women.
SUGAR SHORTAGE HITS
SPAIN AND PORTUGAL
In Spain and Portugal sugar price
are soaring. Both countries have been
seriously affected by the short beet
sugar crop in Europe and the lack ol
ocean tonnage to move Stocks of can
sugar Isolated In far away ports.
Granulated sugur, home grown, was
being sold in Barcelona, Spain, during
the early summer at 19 cents a pound.
The price of brown sugar in Lisbon,
Portugal, fixed by governmental order,
was $1.04 to $1.12 a pound.
By comparison the price of beet
sugar in Sweden is 14 cents a pound.

FRED T. COLTER.
A Brief Sketch of the Life and Achieve
ments of a Popular Candidate
for Governor.
A personal history sketch of
no man in Arizona is more in
teresting than that of Senator
Fred T. Colter, of Apache coun
ty, Arizona, who is a candidate
for the democratic nomination
for governor.
Senator Colter was born in I
Nutrioso, Arizona, thirty nine
years ago, and has always lived
in his native state.
Few men are more virile than
he, and his successes as a priv
ate citizen have been no less
fruitful than the many things
accomplished by him in a public
way. Intense energy has born
him on the tide of success.
Starting in life poor, with his
originality and independent me
thods of thinking, with that
marked trait for development his j
originality is noticeably strong, i
His intentions always being for
the betterment of man and
things, he is yet that type of
man that thinks for himself.
Whatever wisdom or knowl
edge comes to him from other
sources, he has a peculiar facul
ty of picking the sound from the
unsound, retaining the good and
rejecting the bad. Being a self
reliant man it is certain that he
will never, as governor, be in
fluenced or controlled by any
faction or person.
Unlike many men who have
made a success in life, he did
not try to amass wealth to hoard,
but being modest in his achieve
ments, his interest has been in
humanity and in the betterment
of civilization, business and pro
duction. Therefore, he built re
servoirs, cleared land, made
fences, reclaimed the desert and
then when the pioneer work was
done, instead of guarding it
greedily he divided his land into
parcels so that others might
reaiJ the results of bis hard
work.
Besides the reclamation and
development of many acres of
land he laid out the town of
Colter, where his home now is,
and it is one of the show places,
in the shape of a modern live
stock farm ranch in the state.
All his labors in this direction
have been for the purpose of
assisting the settlers in obtain-
ng homes. 1 He is engaged in
banking and general merchan
dise business. ,
During all this period of the
development of the resources of
this state, Senator Colter took
great interest in public affairs
and improvements, knowing that
such improvements mean much
to civilization, thereby increas
ing industry, good roads, educa
tion and development of the
place in which he lived, not only
his town, but the county and
state. He was supervisor of
Apache county for five years.
He was a member of the consti
tutional convention and a state
senator for two terms, which
position he holds at present; D3
sides being Democratic National
Committeeman having charge of
President Wilson's campaign,
giving Wilson a majority of 13,
000 votes in Arizona.
In the legislature he took par
ticular interest in measures of
public welfare that had been
most neglected.
In the constitutional conven
tion he endorsed woman's suf
frage and prohibition when the
latter was very unpopular. He
has done much legislative and
public work for farming and
ranching. He succeeded in get
ting through the famous irriga
tion bill, which makes it possi
ble to organize irrigation dis
tricts and sell bonds for the
development of irrigation and
reclamation of land. This law
makes it possible to develop
many acres of arid land by
pumping and storing water
which was otherwise impossible,
except through private capital.
Mr. Colter has always taken a
marked interest in all laws that
have tended to the development
of all the natural and industrial
resources of the state.
He was a member of the sheep
sanitary board; the state fair
commission; president of the Na
vajo and Apache li vestockman's
association; vice president of the
Arizona Cattle Growers' associa
tion and a member of the impor
tant committee on forest reserves
and public grazing of the Na
tional Livestock association. In
the legislature he has done a
great deal towards the passage
of good roads legislation. In
fact he has always been a leader
in these movements, and when
good roads were mentioned, his
name was always spoken in con
nection with the legislation. He
was a leading official of several
state and national highways.
TheseaccomplUhed things show
Senator Colter to be possessed
of broad ideas and constructive
statesmanship. As governor of
Arizona his service to our young
state will be valuable, and he
and his friends and supporters
are facing the outcome of the
approaching election with the
utmost confidence.
Tom Turner, ex sheriff of San
ta Cruz county, who for the past
year and a half has been in Cal
ifornia, where he owns a ranch
and a big bunch of white face
cattle, has been a Nogales visit
or a couple of days, on business
and pleasure. Tom is in the
market for a bunch of cattle, for
shipment to his California range.
While here he enjoyed a visit
with his daughter, Miss Jewel
Turner, one of our efficient
school teachers. Friends of Tom
will be pleased to learn he is
prospering. He was one of the
best sheriffs ever elected to of

TEMPE NORMAL SCHOOL.
The school year at the Tempe
Normal Sehool will begin Mon
day, September 0, with every
prospect of a very large attend
ance. The school is equipped
not only for regular and special
teacher training but for course
in all lines of vocational train
ing and high school work. There
has never been a time in the
history of our nation when the
necessity for general and special
education was so manifest as at
present.
The state of Arizona has al
ways taken an advanced stand
on all matters) pertaining to edu
cation, and through her public
school system and state aduca
tional institutions is thoroughly
prepared to meet the special de
mands of the present emergency .
The Tempe Normal School of
fers courses leading to teachers'
diplomas not only in the regular
work but in manual training,
home economics, agriculture,
commerce, art, and kindergar
ten. Special courses are also of
fered, without regard to teacher
training, in wood work, machine
shop, forge, Sat metal work,
domestic science, agriculture,
anim;.l husbandry, blacksmith
ing, tool and automobile repair
ing, and all practical work by
half time classes, night school
classes, etc., as required by the
Smith Hughes Vocational Train
ing Act will be offered. In offer
ing this work, the regular aca
demic subjects in English, his
tory, mathematics, languages,
and sciences will not be neglect
ed, and students may complete
the regular high school courses
and prepare for university work
as usual. For all of this work,
the equipment is strictly up to
rate. The shops, laboratories,
and library are among the best
in the Southwest. The classes
in agriculture have the advan
tage of a forty acre farm stock
ed with thoroughbred cattle,
swine, sheep and poultry, with
abundant opportunities for de
monstration work of all kinds.
We would suggest that stu

with the Tempe Normal School.
It is important that students
should register as soon as school
opens or as soon thereafter as
possible. The President of the
school will be pleased to send
you bulletin and detailed infor
mation upon request.
GET READY TO REGISTER.
A telegram from Phoenix,
dated August 21, says:
"If there are any over zealous
or "under" zealous patriots in
Arizona who have been worry
ing for fear the proposed "18 to
45" draft regulations will or will
not go into effect they might as
well take their cue from General
Crowder and quit worrying.
"The adjutant general of the
army is sure the regulations
drafting men from 18 to 45 years
will go into effect. So sure is
he that yesterday Col. Harris,
adjutant general for the state of
Arizona, received some 40 odd
mail sacks from Washington
containing 53,000 of the new
questionnaires to be filled out by
draft registrants between the
ages of 18 and 45.
"The new questionnaires are
substantially the same as those
used in the first draft, what few
changes there are seemingly be
ing made for the purpose of sim
plification in compiling data from
ths questionnaires."
COBB WITHDRAWS FROM RACE
Lamar Cobb, former State En
gineer, has withdrawn from the
Governorshi p race in favor of
Sidney P. Osborn, Secretary of
State. Cobb's withdrawal from
the race was announced this
week in the following letter:
"Phoenix, Ariz., Aug. 22, 1918.
To the Arizona Gazette,
Phoenix, Arizona.
Mr. Editor: I desire to an
nounce to the public and espe
cially to those most loyal friends
who have been supporting me in
the contest for the Democratic
nomination for Governor that I
am not financially able to place
my candidacy before the people
in such manner as would war
rant asking them to continue
their support. Therefore, in jus
tice to them with assurance of
my most sincere appreciation
for their efforts in my behalf, I
withdraw from the contest that
they may lend their assistance
to such candidate as may have a
better chance of winning than I.
I hope that the light I have
been making may have some
small influence in elevating the
standard of political affairs in
our great State of Arizona.
Believing that the interest of
the whole people of Arizona will
be served best by the nomina
tion of Sidney P. Osborn, I in
tend to cast my vote for him.
Yours very truly,
Lamar Conn."
Cobb is the second candidate
to withdraw from the race and
to endorse the candidacy of Os
born. W. A. Moeur, State Land
Commissioner, announced his
withdrawal last week, and de
clared he would give his un
divided support to the Secretary
of State in his campaign for the
Governorship. The withdrawal
of Cobb leaves but three candi
dates in the race for the Demo
cratic nomination. They are
Fred. Colter, Fred. Sutter and
Sidney P. Osborn.
Harry Creighton, special agent
of the U. S. Treasury Depart
ment, has been a visitor here
this week, on official business.
Mr. Creighton was located at
Nogales a number of years, as a
representative of the govern
ment. He has a wide circle of

That the illicit manufacture of

mit that if the moonshiners are
of the same class who have, with
the aid of revenue officers, made
the hunting of clandestine dis
tillers one of the most exciting
of pastimes in the south, the
new phase of the war against

years ago, my stomach was all out of

didn't act. My digestion was bad, and
it took so little to upset me. My ap
petite was gone. I was very weak...
I decided I would give Elack
Draught a thorough trial as I knew it
was highly recommended for this
trouble. I began taking it. I felt
better after a few doses. My appetite
improved and I became stronger. My
bowels acted naturally and the least
trouble was soon righted with a few
doses of Black-Draught."
Seventy years of successful use has
made Thedford's Black-Draught a
standard, household remedy. Every
member, of every family, at times,
need the help that Black-Draught can
give in cleansing the system and re
lieving the troubles that come from
constipation, indigestion, lazy liver.
etc. You cannot keep well unless your
stomach, liver and bowels are in good
working order. Keep them that way.
Try Black-Draught. It acts promptly,
gently and in a natural way. If you
fee! sluggish, take a dose tonight.
You will feel fresh tomorrow. Price
