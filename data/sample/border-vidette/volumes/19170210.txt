CONGRESS HEARS PRESIDENT.
Head of Nation Tells Why U. S. Breaks
With Germany.
List Saturday, February 3rd,
President Wilson formally an
nounced to the country and the
world that diplomatic relations
with Germany had been severed.
Silent and attentive the na- I
tion's lawmakers listened with
rapt attention while President
Wilson told of America's course
in the now unsuccessful diplo
matic struggle to dissuade Ger
many from her campaign of
ruthlessness.
The President spoke as fol
lows: "Gentlemen of the Congress:
"The imperial German gov
ernment on the 31st of January
announced to this government
and to the governments of the
other neutral nations, that on
and after the 1st day of Febru
ary, the present month, it would
adopt a policy with regard to
the use of submarines against all
shipping seeking to pass through
certain areas of the high seas to
which it is clearly my duty to
call your attention.
"Let me remind the congress
on the 8th of April last, in view
of the sinking on the 24th of
March, of the cross channel pas
senger steamer Sussex by a Ger
man submarine withoutsummons
or warning, and the consequent
less of the lives of several citi
zens of the United States who
were passengers aboard her, this
government addressed a note to
the imperial German government
in which it made the following
declaration:
"If it is still the purpose of
the imperial government to pro
secute relentless and indiscrim
inate warfare against vessels of
commerce by the use of subma
rines without regard to what the
government of the United States
must consider the sacred and un
disputable rules-of international
law and the universally recog
nized dictates of humanity, the
government of the United States
is at last forced to the conclu
sion that there is but one course
it can pursue. Unless the im
perial government should now
immediately declare and effect
an abandonment of its present
methods of submarine warfare
against passenger and freight
carrying vessels, the govern
ment of the United States can
have no choice but to sever di
plomatic relations with the Ger
man empire altogether.
"In reply to the declaration,
the imperial German government
gave this government the fol
lowing assurances:
" 'The German government is
prepared to do its utmost to con
fine the operations of war for
the rest of its duration to the
fighting forces of the belliger
ents, thereby also insuring the
freedom of the seas, a principle
upon which the German govern
ment believes now, as before, to
be in agreement with the gov
ernment of the United States..
" 'The German government,
guided by this idea, notifies the
government of the United Estates
that the German naval forces
have received the following or
ders: "In accordance with the
general principles of visit and
search and destruction of mer
chant vessels recognized by in
ternational law, such vessels,
both within and without the area
declared a naval war zone, shall
not be sunk without warning
and without saving human lives,
unless these ships attempt to
escape or offer resistance.
" 'But,' it added, 'neutrals can
not expect that Germany, forced
to fight for existence, shall for
the sake of neutrals' interest re
strict the use of an effective
weapon if her enemy is permit
ted to continue to apply at will
methods of warfare violating the
rules of international law. Such
a demand would be incompatible
with the character of neutrality
and the German government is
convinced that the government
of the United States does not
think of making such a demand,
knowing that the government of
the United States has repeatedly
declared that it is determined to
restore the principle of the free
dom of the seas, from whatever
quarter it has been violated.'
"To this the government of
the United States replied on the
eight of May accepting of course
the assurance given, but adding:
"The government of the Unit
ed States feels it necessary to
state that it takes for granted
that the Imperial German gov
eminent does not intend to imply
that the maintenance of its new
ly announced policy is in any
way contingent uoon the course
or result of diplomatic negotia
tions between the government of
the United States and any other
belligerent government, notwith
standing the fact that certain
passages in the Imperial gov
ernment's note of the fourth in
stant might appear to be sus
ceptible of that construction. In
order, However, to avoid any
misunderstanding, the govern
ment of the United States noti
fies the Imperial government
that it cannot for a moment en
tertain much less a suggestion
that respect by German naval
authorities for the rights of citi
zens of the United States upon
the high seas should in any way
or in the slightest degree be
made contingent upon the con
duct of any other government,
affecting the rights of neutrals
and non-combatants. Responsi
bility in such matters is single,
not ioint, absolute, not relative.'
"To this note of the 8th of
May the Imperial German gov
ernment made no reply.
"On the thirty firstof January,
the Wednesday of the present
week, the German ambassador
handed to the Secretary of State,
along with a formal note, memo
randum which contained the fol
lowing statement:
" 'The Imperial government
therefore does not doubt that the
government of the United States
will understand the situation
thus forced upon Germany by
the Entente allies' brutal me
thods of war and by their deter
mination to destroy the central
powers and that the government
of the United States will further
realize that the now openly dis
closed intention of the Entente
allies gives back to Germany
the freedom of action which she
reserved in her note addressed
to the goverement of the United
States on May 4th, 1916.
" 'Under these circumstances
Germany will meet the illegal
measures of her enemies by for
cibly preventing, after February
1st, 1917, in a zone around Great
Britain, France, Italy and in the
eastern Mediterranean all nav
igation, that of neutrals includ
ed, from and to England and
from and to France, etc. All
ships met within the zone will
be sunk.
"I think you will agree with
me that in view of this daclara
tion, which suddenly and without
prior intimation of any kind
deliberately withdraws the so
lemn assurance given in the Im
perial government's note of the
fourth of May, 1916, this govern
ment has no alternative con
sistent with the dignity and hon
or of the United States but to
take the course which in its note
of the 18th of April, 1916, an
nounced that it would take in the
event that the German govern
ment did not declare and effect
an abandonment of the methods
of submarine warfare which it
was then employing and to which
it now purposes again to resort.
"I have, therefore, directed
the Secretary ef State to an
nounce to his Excellency, the
German ambassador, that all
diplomatic relations between the
United States and the German
Empire are severed and that
the American ambassador at
Berlin, will immediately be
withdrawn and in compliance
with this decision to hand to his
excellency his passports.
"Notwithstanding this unex
pected action of the German
government, this sudden and
deeply deplorable renunciation
of its assurances, given this
government at one of the most
critical moments of tension in the
relations of the two government's
I refuse to believe that it is the
intention of the German author
ities to do in fact what they have
warned us they will feel at lib
erty to do. I cannot bring my
self to believe that they will in
deed pay no regard to the an
cient friendship between their
people and our own or to the
solemn obligations which have
been exchanged between them
and destroy American ships and
take the lives of American citi
zens in the wilful prosecution of
the ruthless naval program they
have announced their intention
to adopt. Only actual overt
acts on their part can make me
believe it even now.
"If this confidence on my part
in the sobriety and prudent for
sight of their purpose should
unhappily prove unfounded; if
American ships and American
lives should in fact be sacrificed
by their naval commanders in
heedless contravention of the
just and reasonable understand
ings of international law and
the obvious distates of human
ity, I shall take the liberty of
again coming before the con
gress to ask that authority be
given me to use any means that
may be necessary for the pro
tection of our women and our
people in the presecutioa of their
peaceful and legitimate errands
on the high seas. I can do noth
ing less. I take if for granted
that all neutral governments will
take the same course.
"We do not desire any hostile
conflict with the Imperial Gov
ernment. We are sincere friends
of the German people and earn
estly desire to remain at peace
with the government which
speaks for them. We shall not
believe that they are hostile to
us unless and until we are oblig
ed to believe it; and we propose
nothing more than the reason
able defence of the undoubted
rights of our people. We wish
to serve no selfish ends. We
seek merely to stand true alike
in thought and in action to the
immemorial principles of our
people which I bad sought to ex
press in my address to the senate
only two weeks ago. We seek
merely to vindicate our right to
liberty and justice and an un
molested life. These, are the
basis of peace, not war. God
grant that we may not be chal
lenged to defend them by the
acts of wilful injustice on the
part of the government of Ger
many." Three R Flotation Concentrator Plant.
The new oil flotation concen
trator at the Three R is now
practically completed, and is only
awaiting the extension of the
power line to start up. It is ex
pected the power will be ready
to turn on within a few weeks,
as poles have already been plac
ed, and there remains only the
work of putting on insulation
and stretching the wires. The
new plant is the very latent idea
in modern concentrator construc
tion. It was built at a cost of
about $40,000, and is throughly
up to do- date in every particu
lar. It is built with a 100-ton a
day capacity, but it is believed
by different methods of speeding
up the machinery an output of
125 or probably even as high as
140 Irons a day can be run
through. The building to cover
the plant is also built with the
idea in view of enlarging by the
additions of another unit, every
thing being so arranged that the
entire plant can be doubled in
capacity with the minimum of
expense and labor.
Nearly 100 men are now on the
payroll at the Three R, and
while the completion of the new
concentrator will not require any
considerable addition to the force
as the mill works almost auto
matically, within, a short time
the mine force will probably have
to be increased. It is estimated
that there is now enough ore on
the dump to keep the new mall
going at full capacity for two or
three months. Patagonian.
Never in the history of this
community has there been as
much thievery going on as there
has been this winter. Twenty
five years ago few people locked
their doors. In front of every
meat market sides of beef and
other animals were left banging
out all night. Nobody watched
and petty theft was a rare oc
currence. Now, if you turn your
back everything that isn't nailed
down will be stolen. We're get

i aggressive membership enroll-
service and bespeak every effort
for complete and thorough or
ganization for possible needs.
Give this telegram full publi

FOR OUR NATIONAL HONOR.
The United States today is
closer to the brink of war than
she has been at any time since
the peace treaty with Spain was
signed at Portsmounth.
Germany has violated her
solemn pledges, and has served
practical notice upon this govern
ment that our ships and citizens
travel the high seas at their
peril.
This is in direct violation af all
international law and practice,
and is a repudiation of the pro
mises of the imperial govern
ment to this country.
There was nothing left for the
president to do, if the honor of
the nation is to be upheld, than
to hand Ambassador Von Bern
strff his passports and sever all
diplomatic relations with the
country that has broken faith
with us.
A united nation will line up
solidly behind President Wilson.
He has demonstrated that he will
go to any honorable length to
avert bloodshed; beyond such
lengths we would not have him
go. Arizona Cassette.

WOMEN'S WILSON UNION.
George J. Stoneman, of Phoe
nix, Chairman of the State De
mocratic Central Committee, has
received the following letter
from Mrs. Kate Trenholm Abra
hams, secretary of the Women's
Wilson Union, the headquarters
of which are at loth Street and
Pennsylvania Avenue, Washing
ton, D. C. :
"The Women's Wilson Union
has kiudiy given the use of its
headquarters in Washington to
the Women's Division of the In
augurate Committee.
"These headquarters contain
large rooms, most admirably
suited for the work necessary,
in the organization of the Wo
men's Section in the parade, and
also for the entertainment and
accommodation of the women of
the country who shall visit
Washington at that time.
"It is the intention of the com
mittee to have as large a repre
sentation of women and women's
organizations in the parade as it
is possible to enroll.
The will be forty-nine floats,
each representing a state of the
Union and the District of Colum
bia, several hundred women
horseback riders, girl scouts,
clubs and individual marchers.
"Will you kindly extend
through the newspapers, and in
any other way you deem advis
able an invitation from us to the
women of your state, asking
that they co-operate with us in
making the women's section most
successful, and also extend to
those who contemplate coming
to Washington a cordial invita
tion to use freely our headquait
ers during their stay in the city.
"Any further information will
be gladly given, if you will com
municate with us, or if you refer
anyone to us.
"Thanking you in advance for
any help you can give, I remain.

ARIZONA AWAITS CALL.
If a break comes with Ger
many, and the United States is
thrust into the world war, Ari
zona, the "Baby State," will be
the first to answer the call to
arms. Just as in 1898, the terri
torial troops were prompt with
their response to the appeal from
the White House. Now, the
"state which put forty eight
stars in the U. S. A.," is ready
and anxious to do all it can to
preserve the integrity of the
nation.
The officers of the Arizona Na
tional guard won great honor
and took a' perilous place in the
war with Spain, and now her
sons are anxious to rally . to the
support of whoever takes the
lead in organizing the forces.
There are 1200 men needed to
bring the national guard up to
war strength, but so confident
are the officers that this will be
done readily that they are al
ready talking of overflow organ
izations which will be sent to
the front.
According to Associated Press
dispatches, Capt. John C. Green
way, of the famous Rough Rid
ers, has again offered to lay
down the management of a great
mining company to serve his
country with the same zeal with
which he served nearly twenty
years ago. Governor Campbell
also has received an offer from
J. P. Denman, of Mohave coun
ty, of a full war strength, well
trained company, which months
ago began putting itself in read
iness for eventualities in Mexico.
While it is earnestly hoped
that the worsE will not come, the
great Arizona spirit is inspiring,
and everybody must commend
the readiness of our citizens to
offer their lives for the support
of the U. S. flag. No better
soldiers went against Spain than
the Arizonans, and in the ranks
of the Rough Riders were the
sons of the wealthy, tigthing
side by side with miners, ran
chers and cowboys.
A few hours after the situa
tion became critical, Tucson's
sons and daughters began active
work . getting the Red Cross
forces together, and as Soon as
needed the old Pueblo will be
able to send out her quota of
doctors and nurses to give first
aid to those who may become ill
in camp or wounded on battle
field. Tucson Citizen.

Patagonia Road to Be Improved Soon.
J. W. Larimore, county en
gineer, was in town Monday en
route to Canille. He reports
good progress on road work now
being done on Washington-Du-quesne
road and at the bridge.
The bridge is practically com
pleted and the approaches lead
ing to it will soon be finished.
It was necessary to make about
two miles of new road in order
to permit traffic on theDuquesne
road, the bridge changing the
old road from that camp. From
the bridge toward Patagonia
several miles of new road have
been completed and will be open
ed for traffic within a few days.
Engineer Liarimore estimates
that it will take about another
month to finish all the work
where the present camp is estab
lished; then the crews will turn
toward Patagonia. He says fur
ther that by the latter part of
June or the first of July, Patago
nians will have a good road all
the way to the county seat one
that none of us can kick about.
This road from Patagonia to No
gales is by far the most import
ant one in the county, and there
has been considerable complaint
that its improvement was not
undertaken before other new
work was started. Therefore,
news that it is the intention to
complete this road within the
next few months will be joyfully
received by citizens of this end
of the county, who have a con
stantly increasing business with
Nogales. Patagonian.

TO ERADICATE LOCO WEED.
Efforts are being made by J.
K. Campbell, a brother of Gov
ernor Tom Campbell, and other
Cattlemen of the upper Verde
valley, to have the United States
department of agriculture un
dertake the eradication of the
loco weed.
The loco weed is taking the
upper Verde, which was one of
the best t,tock ranges in the
state a few years ago. It is a
hardy perennial which is green
and luxuriant when other range
plants are dead. Stock find it
appetizing fodder, but after a
cow or horse feeds on loco weed
a few days they go crazy, lose
weight and unless placed where
they cannot eat it, eventually
die.
There is so much loco week on
the upper Verder that Campbell,
who is superintendent of the Del
Rio Cattle company, is now feed
ing 120 head of cattle inside.
The situation is sure to be even
more serious in early spring
when loco will be the only green
range feed.
Various efforts have been made
by the forest service and agri

U. S. IS WITH PRESIDENT.
No Politics When Honor of Nation Is
at Stake.
A Washington dispatch dated
last Saturday says:
Leaders in congress without
regard to politics expressed free
ly their approval of President
Wilson's course and of his ad
dress. Vice President Marshall said :
"If the president has to de
liver the other address he spoke
of, you will find the sentiment of
the country lias crystallized be
hind him on the address he made
today. The American people
are an easy going people but
when they get their backs to the
wall they will fight."
Senator Stone, chairman of the
foreign relations committee:
"I think there are two things
we should do now as far as it is
possible keep our heads level
and our mouths closed."
Senator Lodge, ranking Re
publican member of the rela
tions committee:
"I most thoroughly approve
and support the president in
giving the German ambassador
his passports and recalling our
ambassador from Berlin. It is
the right thing to do and is de
manded both by the honor and
the safety of the American peo
ple." Speaker Clark:
"I do not think there is going
to be any war. I do not think
the Germans will blow up any of
our ships. I think the president
stated the conditions exactly."
Republican Leader Mann:
"I do not see how the presi
dent could do any less. I am
very glad he did not purpose to
do any more."
Senator Kern, the Democratic
senate leader:
"I believe the American peo
pie are behind the president to
a man and congress certainly is.
There is nothing more to be
done, of cousse, until some tan
gible program is presented to
congress. The business of con
gress now is to await develop
ments." Senator Gallinger, Republican
leader of the senate:
"Of course if Germany sinks
an American ship or takes an
American life we shall have to
fight. But we should view the
situation calmly, dispassionately
and hopefully. The president's
message was admirable."
Senator Reed, Democrat:
"There was no alternative for
the president. A great nation
cannot permit a foreign poten
tate to mark out the lanes
through the ocean over which
he will graciously permit com
merce to be borne. A nation
which loses its self respect will
soon lose its independence."
Senator Smoot, Republican:
"I approve of the president's
position outlined in his address
and believe if the same attitude
had been taken by the president
a year and a half ago, we would
have sared the country a gieat
deal of humiliation and would
have been better understood by
the other nations of the earth "
Senator Cummins, Republican:
"I entirely approve of the pre
sident's course. I do not see
how he could have done any
thing else in view of the Amer
ican position. Whether or not
war comes depends, of course,
on whether Germany carries out
her threat. I agree with the pres
ident in the belief that Ger
many will not go that far." .
Senator Chamberlain, chair
man of the senate military com
mittee: "The president has done all
that could be done. Now it is
up to Germany."
Senator Brandegee, Repub
lican: "I .approve the recall of Am
bassador Gerard from Berlin and
the dismissal of the German am
bassador from this country. The
administration would have stulti
fied itself if it had failed to sever
diplomatic relations."
Senator Weeks, Republican:
"I think it is the best address
the president ever made. He
could not say more and he could
not say less."
Representative Flood, chair
man of the house foreign affairs
committee:
"The president's course was
wise and I am sure has the ap
proval of the country. I have
talked with many members of
the house and it is practically
solid in approving his course.
The president could not have
done less and was wise not to do
more at this time."
PLANT SUDAN GRASS.
The following information is
valuable to those who ace in a
position to plant Sudan grass in
Arizona:
Sudan grass has been success
fully grown on all of our station
farms this past year. Two of
these farms were dry farming,
one situated in the northern part
of the State at an altitude of 5,
000 feet, another one in the low
er plateau region in the south
eastern part of the State at an
altitude of 4,000 feet. On both
of these dry farms the Sudan
seed can be sown as paly in
spring as the late frosts will
permit, and will mature into a
good hay crop for the first cut
ting in about 75 days. We can
mature it for seed in these re
gions from 100 to 115 days. In
the irrigated sections of the
State Sudan can be sown from
March to the first of August and
mature a seed crop.
We made one planting in the
Salt River valley on the 19th of
August, and abtained 3.3 tons
cutting of excellent hay on the
26th of Oc ober. There is no
question about the adaptability
of this crop to Arizona condi
tions. It is meeting with par
ticular favor as a forage crop in
the dry farming sections J. P.
Nicholson, agronomist, Univer
sity of Arizona.

There is greater activity in the
Parker district just now than at
any time in its previous history.
Operators from practically every

addition to the usual percentage
of boomtime floaters and hangers-on
a substantial number of
moneyed men or their' represen
tatives have been included in the
recent arrivals.

It Always Helps
says Mrs. Sylvania Woods, of Clifton Mills, Ky., in
writing of her experience with Cardui, the woman's
tonic. She says further: "Before 1 began to use
Cardui, my back and head would hurt so bad, I
thought the pain would kill me. I was hardly able
to do any of my housework. After taking three bottles
of Cardui, I bcg?.n to feel like a new woman. I soon
gained 35 pounds, and now, I do all my housework,
as well as run a big water mill.
I wish every suffering woman would give
The Woman's Tonic
a trial. I still use Cardui when I feel a little bad,
and it always does me good."
Headache, backache, side ache, nervousness,
lired, worn-out feelings, etc., are sure signs of woman
ly trouble. Signs that you need Cardui, the woman's
tonic. You cannot make a mistake in trying Cardui
for your trouble. It has been helping weak, ailing
women for more than fifty years.
