GREAT RECORD FOR ALLIES.
During the past two months
the allies on the western front
have taken 185,000 prisoners and
put out of commission 600,000
more. i he accomplishment of
this great feat of arms was
brought about by the advent of
the big American army in
Prance. And this same Auaer
ican army has so heartened the
whole allied bunch that every
where they have gone ahead,
knowing that Uncle Sam will
back them with money, men and
materials, as well as feeding
them on the best grub in the
land. The fact that the United
States was able to transport to
France in the past six months
more than 1,500,000 men has as
sured the lighting men of our
friendly nations that we can
keep the balance in favor of the
allies with ease. As the days
go by the Americans will take
over more and more of the front
lines and give the other hard
fighters a breathing spell be
fore the crucial days come on.
BANK AT PATAGONIA.
W. P. Capehart, formerly as
sistant cashier of the Tucson
National bank, is establishing a
bank at Patagonia. Mr. Cape
hart went to Camp Logan at
Houston for Y. M. C. A. war
work training but was rejected
for physical reasons. He has
interested the citizens of Pata
gonia in the bank to the extent
of 50 per cent of the stock.
Citizen.
Use of platinum in jewelry is
prohibited after today in regula
tions issued by the war indus
tries board. No peraon, manu
facturer or dealer licensed by
the board may purchase or sell
platinum, irradium, and pal li -
dium or their compounds, or
have in their possession for more
than 90 days after October 1,
more than one ounce of the me
tals. The regulations in no way
apply to the sale of jewelry al
ready manufactured. Use of the
metals in dentistry, science and
other electrical work is not prohibited.
Mr. M. E. Musgrave of the
biological survey of the depart
ment of agriculture, in charge
of tlie force exterminating pre
datory animals in Arizona, was
in Patagonia last week making
preparation to clean out the
beasts in this neighborhood.
Twenty men are at work in this
state in this occupation.
J. R. Patterson and Lee Park
er, two of the men engaged in
trapping for the government, re
cently killed 51 mountain lions
in the immediate vicinity of Pa
tagonia. They also caught many
coyotes and wolves. Mr. Pat
terson will return soon and will
make Patagonia his headquart
ers. He will remain here about
18 months.
Cattlemen and others are cau
tioned against poisoning car
cases of dead animals or putting
out poison in any manner, as
the government trapper's dogs
are valuable animals and may
become victims.
The trappers are not highly
paid employes of Uncle Sam,
and cattlemen and ranchers who
lend assistance to them in the
way of furnishing saddle horses
and a place to sleep and eat
while in their neighborhood will
assist greatly in the work of
protecting stock from the rav
ages of predatory animals. The
trappers must pay their own ex
penses as they go and are not
allowed to accept bounties from
any source.
Government owned traps have
been tampered with by though -less
persons, and the public is
warned not to molest them nor
the animals found therein. The
men employed at the work will
see that persons caught in the
act of destroying government
traps; or molesting the animals
fount' in them will be prosecut
ed. Patagonian.
Be Careful With Fire in Woods.
The hearty co operation ol
sportsmen who are now prepar
ing for their fall outing in the
prevention and suppression of
forest fires is being requested by
the forest officers of the Coro
nado National Forest.
The rangers report, owing to
the light rainfall of the proceed
ing summer, an exceedingly dry
condition existing in the moun
tains. The green grass and
weeds normally found on the
forest at this time of the year
which retards the spread of fires
is now highly inflammable. It
is therefore necessary to exer
cise every precaution to present
fires from starting.
The man power available dur
ing ordinary years for lighting
forest tires has been heavily
drawn upon for military and in
dustrial purposes. It would
therefore be difficult to organize
fire fighting crews in case of
emergencies.
In view of these conditions
every hunter and camper should
consider it a duty of highest
patriotism in seeing that no
camp fire is left unattended and
that fires are completely extin
guished after serving their pur
pose. Forest officers will gladly ac
cord all possible information to
those desiring such regarding
trails and camping sites.
COWMAN ENTERTAINS.
Glenn Darrell entertained last
week a number of friends at a
dinner party. Mr. Darrell being
a bachelor and short on china
ware, they drew straws to de
termine who should eat off plates,
the losers taking saucers. Those
present were Mrs. V. P. Han
son, Mr. and Mrs. A. L. Hanson,
Misses Georgia and Evelyn Han
son, Mrs. Lynford Hanson, Dr.
and Mrs. lies, Mr. and Mrs. W.

A. C. Dalton, Master Howard,
Raymond, Shirley, Hettie, Lee,
Virginia M. Dalton, Mr. and

Reservations for box seats for
the State Fair to be held in
Phoenix November 11 to 16 in
elusive, will received now at the
office of the Fair Commission.
The sale of box seats, or rath
er the reservation, began Octo
ber first. All'boxes are alloted
by the equitable method of draw
ing for position. Under this
system all purchasers have an
equal chance and absolutely no
favoritism is shown. The num
ber of boxes are drawn from a
hat, and the boxes alloted as the
numbers are drawn. The draw
ing will take place November
ti rst.
There are 116 boxes this year,
each equipped with six comfort
able chairs. The cost of a box
is $25.00, this sum including ad
mission to the grand stand and
to the box for six persons each
day during Fair Week.
Already a number of checks
and reservations have been re
ceived by Secretary Boyce, and
as it is certain that there will be
more orders received than there
are boxes to be sold, it behooves
the prospective box holder to
get in early.

LITTLE SUGAR STORIES.
Fresh fruits aHd green vegetables
used freely in the diet will cut the de
mand for very swet-t desserts.
Serve very ripe sweet peaches,
pears and figs without the addition of
sugar, or with cream whipped up with
a little white sirup or honey.
If fruit is allowed to become soft
ripe on the trees It will acquire enough
sugar on Its own account to make It
very palatable for cunuing wlthont
sugar. Where fruit is abundant, can
ripe fruit in its own juice.
Too much sugar is used on the
American table with a consequent
of variety and piquancy of flavor. The
nutty flavor of grains, the distinottvc
flavor of fruits and the real coffee
taste ar too often smothered with too
much sugar.
Sirup made b reducing the Juice
f Rrapes. apples or iears to one
seventh of the original volume can b
used in preserving, !ti canning or on
the table 1n replace siipar to n great
titrr.t.
The sugar situation in Arizona
is extremely critical, and all per
sons are requested to save as
much as possible from their al
lowance, according to a bulletin
just issued by the hotel and re
staurant division of the food ad
ministration for the state. The
bulletin continues:
"No more than one teaspoon
ful (granulated) or two half
cubes or lumps should be served
to one person at a meal. This
quantity of sugar should take
care of coffee, cereal or fruit or
all three of them, provided the
patron orders the three. In
struct your waiters to mention
this when taking orders.
"The 2 pound-per-90 meal al
lotment should take care of all
cooking requirements except
baking. All sugar used in a
public eating place or club must
come out of the 2 pound-per-90
meal allotment requests for bak
ing purposes should be limited
to 70 per cent of the quantity
used during a previous specified
time for baking purposes only.
"Several restaurants have
been permitted to contribute to
the Red Cross for violation of
the sugar program, and a too
liberal service of sugar is apt to
be regarded by the Federal Ad
ministration as evidence that a
public eating place has too much
sugar in its possession and may
lead to its supply being cut off
altogether."
PASTURES IN MEXICO.
Arrangements have been made
to take American cattle into
Mexico and re-import them when
range conditions warrant their
return. There are a number of
big pastures along' the border,
on the Mexican side of the line,
that are well fenced and have
plenty of grass, with no cattle
in them. Arrangements hayo'
been made with both the Amer
ican and Mexican governments
to take cattle over and bring
them back. Owners of these
pastures will take cattle to pas
ture for reasonable rates, or
they will buy the cattle in num
bers from 5,000 head and up, if
time will be given on them.
Cattleman.

known cattle man of Pinal coun
ty, has taken an interest and

rillas Cattle company, owned by
Jack McVey, and will at once

You are reading every day of our
boys over there of Pershing's divis
ions charging into the blasting fire
of the Boche trenches; of small de
tachments smashing their way from
house to house through ruined vil
lages; of single-handed deeds of sac
rifice and valor.
One thought, one impulse only
fills their souls to fight and keep on
fighting, until the war is won.
They know that all America is back of
them; they know that they can count on us at
home to send them all the guns and supplies
they need to win.
There is ony one way we can do it.
u4Il of us must work and save and
buy Liberty Bonds, with OUT whole
souls, the zvay our men are
fighting over there!
No less will win. There is no other
way to provide the money the Gov
