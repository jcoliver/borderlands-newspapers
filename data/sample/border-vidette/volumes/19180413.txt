enlarged and remodeled. Citi
zens of Cottonwood seek to in
corporate the town and an effort
is under way to increase the
mail service between Jerome and
Cottonwood from three times a
week to six.
With a degree of definite satis
faction, tinctured with no exul
tation, Tucson receives the news
that Harold Steinfeld of Tucson
has been inducted into the Unit
ed States army. After a long
series of attempts the Tucson
boy has failed in his efforts for
exemption and the greatest in
stitution of democracy, yet tried
in the country, has been vindi
cated. We are speaking of the
selective service law.
The Arizona Cattleman says:
The season looks good for plen
ty of spring grass for southern
Arizona, and in fact, most of the
southwest. The spring round
up will soon be started and
many thousand cattle will be go
ing to the finishing ranges for
preparing them for beef. In
this part cf the country the
round-up will begin about the
loth of April, and by the first of
June about all the cattle will be
marketed.
All offenses in Arizona, except
treason, and that is a federal
offense, are bailable since the
abolition of capital punishment.
Some people are not aware of
this fact and also the further
fact that it is mandatory for a
magistrate or judge to fix bail
for any offense when application
for it is made to him. Therefore
it follows that any person ac
cused of crime, can obtain his
liberty through the legal pro
cedure above outlined.
According to information given
out by Mrs. Harry C. Wheeler
at Tombstone, her husband, Cap
tain Harry C. Wheeler, formerly
sheriff of this county, sailed for
Prance last week and probably
is "over there" by this time.
He was in charge of a detach
ment of signal corps men. Mrs.
Wheeler said she left Captain
Wheeler at the docks just before
his vessel steamed out. Pend
ing the return of the captain she
will remain at her home in
Tombstone.
The plans made by the Ariz
ona Council of Defense for the
building of silos and a conse
quent saving of summer crops,
brought through into the winter,
has brought most happy results,
especially in the Salt River val
ley and in the farming country
around Tucson. The University
of Arizona agricultural depart
ment suggests that the move be
extended to embrace stockmen
and dry farmers. Por fattening
cattle and sheep, it is declared
there can be no better ration
than silage and cotton cake
meal.
R. L. Slaughter, Jr., of Doug
las, has returned home after
service with the American avia
tion corps, Mrs. Slaughter com
ing with him. He answered the
call when the first selective draft
summons came, and went into
the aviation section from the na
tional army training camp. He
took the regular course and be
came J graduate flier, bat heart
trouble developed and he was re
leased from service. Mr. Slaugh
ter qualified in every way in low
altitude flights, but when he went
to the height of two miles, a
heart weakness was revealed.
A letter has been received by
a Douglas friend of Neill E.
Bailey, formerly a represent
ative in the state legislature
from Cochise county, that he
now is a captain in the national
army, having been assigned to
the directorship of inland tran
sportation. He expects soon to
be ordered to Prance. Bailey
was superintendent of the South
ern Pacific railroad of Mexico
for several years, with head
quarters at Naco, and later was
made superintendent of the Ver
de valley railroad. Prior to his
entrance into the army he was
engaged in mining in the vicin
ity of Jerome.
Scott White is now full fledged
receiver of the United States
land office, his bond having been
approved by the secretary and
all persons who have made en
tries of any kind and had them
suspended on account of the va
cancy in the receiver's office
may make their payments. The
Phoenix land office has on de
posit over 52,000 on account of
suspended applications which
shows something of the volume
of work in this office. Prom
$8,000 to $15,000 is received by
this office each month.

three months of 1918 approxim
ately 20,000,000 pounds of cop

LOOK UNCLE SAM IN THE EYE
"I am your Uncle Sam and I
am in a lot of trouble. The Ger
man Kaiser is trying to lick me
and he is trying to lick you.
He is murdering children over
in Europe, and if we were there,
he'd murder us.
"Several hundred thousand of
my boys have gone over there
to try to stem the tide of victory
for Germany, and now I am com
ing to you with the facts. I need
money. My boys have come
gallantly to me, but unless I can
send them something to eat and
guns and ammunition, they are
going to be slaughtered just as
the poor babies and women and
children over there have been
killed and tortured.
"My eyes are to dim, and my
heart to full to tell you all the
terrible things the Germans
have done to the French, Eng
lish and Belgian people. The
lump in my throat gets too big
when I think of it.
"I don't think about it because
the fight is too big and every
ounce of energy and thought
must be put into the fight. The
flood gates of German cruelty
and brute force are open wide,
and I am trying to help stop the
torrents.
"I want you, each one of you
looking me in the eyes, to dig
deep into your pockets and lend
me every cent you can put your
hands on. I need it my boys
need it. Some of my men will
see you and ask you to subscribe
to my Liberty Bonds. Do not
let them go away without a sub
scription from you, a subscrip
tion for every dollar's worth of
bonds you can subscribe.
"Look me in the eye."
ONE HUNDRED AND ONE.
CUT DOWN.
Cut down auto mileage and
save gas, tires and lubricants.
The army and navy can use
them. Cut down sugar consump
tion. France needs sugar. Cut
down on wheat bread. Corn is
good. The Allies need wheat.
Cut down on beef consumption
and help the poor here and the
armies abroad. Save milk for
the children; adults do not need
much. Cut down! If by doing
so you save money, there are
the bonds.
Kaiserite Busy in America Spreading
German Propaganda.
German propagandists have
been busy since the entry to the
United States into the war.
Falsehoods of every character
have been spread over every
section of the country with the
idea of abusing the confidence ol
the American people. So per
sistent has been the circulation
of these carefully moulded pro
German lies that an official ex
posure of them has been issued
as a painphlet, entitled "The
Kaiserite in America" by the
Committee on Public Informa
tion. 8 Jackson Place, Washing
ton, D. C. A copy of this pam
phlet may be had free if inquiry
will be directed to the Commit
tee. Tales have been current about
interned German prisoners be
ing fed five meals a day, about
Red Cross supplies being sold
to shopkeepers by dishonest of
ficials, by criminal waste of food
at training camps and many
other like falsehoods either de
signated to discourage volunteer
Red Cross work and the loyal
efforts of housekeepers to save
food or calculated to create a
troublesome distrust of the Gov
ernment. The circulation of these stories
is often due to the folly of a
citizen who wishes to appear to
have "inside information" and
who either innocently or inten
tionally starts a lie that rapidly
grows worse as it spreads. A
collection of such lies and their
refutation has been made by the
St. Louis Republic. A hundred
of them are included in "The
Kaiserite in America.
Save Wheat and Save Liberty.
Through voluntary co opera
tion Pood Administrator Hoover
asks the public to assist in sav
ing more wheat and fiour. In
obedience to a definite set of
rules he not only calls on eating
places and clubs, bakers and
grocers to restrict consumption,
but upon households as well.
The point has been reached
whereby universal agreement,
for our own sake and the benefit
of our allies, we must carefully
husband the wheat supply of the
country. The system of volun
tary rationing is on trial. It
imposes no hardship on any per
son. It does require the abso
lute stoppage of waste and of
self-indulgence both as a matter
of principle and expediency.
When millions upon millions
of people in other countries, be
cause of the exigencies of war,
are carrying bread cards and
are forced to count day by day
the exact number of ounces of
bread that they eat, Americans
everywhere can well afford
cheerfully to aid in cutting down
by half the national consump
tion. Nowhere else in the world
is food so plentiful as in the
United States or to be had in so
great variety. If we do not
save voluntarily the next step
will be compulsion.
Fcod Administrator Hoover,
armed with the facts of the
situation, calls the Nation to its
duty. That ought to be enough,
and the response should be
prompt and spontaneous.
The big mining companies of
Bisbee have at last decided that
the low grade coppers overlying
the rich ore bodies of the War
ren district have potential values
that will make that district one
of the most wonderful copper
sections of the globe. The work
of clearing off the overburden
and getting an ocular sizing up
of the ore bearing possibilities
of the camp is now under way
and the big mills will soon be a
reality. The tonnage to be run
through the mills will be above
10,000 daily and will give the
smelters a most desirable pro
duct to mix with the raw ores of
the mines. The development of
the low grade ore bodies will
add thousands of men to the
payroll of the Copper Queen and
Calumet & Arizona and make
the district one of the largest
employers of minersof any camp
in the world. Miner.
AN EXPRESSION OF THANKS
Mrs. A. M. Gillespie desires
to extend her thanks to the
public for the liberal patronage
extended the song recital given
under her direction Saturday
evening for the benefit of the
Red Cross, and at the same time
to express her gratitude to those
who assisted her in preparation
and rendition of the recital; al
though she experienced a few
disappointments from those who
promised their support.
If rushing the performance
the p3st week on account of low
funds, she feels repaid, however,
since the handsome sum of $150
was realized.
There is not much for sur
prise that the association does
not thrive when members of the
Red Cross entertain the same
evening that a benefit perform
ance is given, although the large
price of the tickets was paid. It
is not so much the small cash
which counts as the influence.
What organization can succeed
withou co-operation of mem
bers ?
There is uo time for competi
tion, jealousies and petty feel
ings. In this time of distress
"over there" is it a time to ques
tion the value received?
No one is independent these
days when we belong to our gov
ernment absolutely, and should
respond to every call for help;
especially for tne Red Cross.
How else are our soldiers to be
cared for.
If the call comes to give up
our husbands, our boys or our
property, we must submit un
questioningly. Therefore, with
whom, when or where, the Red
Cross should come first; and
then pleasure.
Mrs. A. M. Gillespie.

WHIPPLE COMING BACK.
President R. N. Fredericks of
the Prescott State Bank, than
whom no man has worked hard
er or more efficiently for the re
habilitation of Whipple Bar
racks, has news from Washing
ton that Major Fitzhugh Carter
will arrive at Whipple in about
two weeks to take charge of
affairs looking to the establish
ment of a big sanitarium for sick
soldiers; also that two men have
been ordered to proceed from
Sackett's Harbor to Whipple to
overhaul the ice plant and cold
storage plant at that post, and
see what, if any, additional ma
chinery and supplies may be
needed, and to order same. It
is hoped that this recognition of
the favorable location of the
post may lead to its permanent
garrisoning after the war, as it
is certain that this country will
maintain more of an army than
before the present war, for
sometime, at least. Prescott

PATRIOTS GET TOGETHER.
Thursday evening patriotic
members of the Nogales Cham
ber of Commerce, and their
friends, had a sure enough "Get
Together" meeting at the Santa
Cruz Club.
The meeting, which was for
the purpose of boosting the
Third Liberty Bond, was pre
sided over by Bracey Curtis,
president of the chamber of
commerce, who in a patriotic ad
dress explained the object of the
meeting, and made a strong plea
in behalf of the Liberty Bonds.
Speeches were made by the
following gentlemen : Judge W.
A. O'Conner, Hon. Leslie C.
Hardy, L. Hofmeister, president
of the Tucson Chamber of Com
merce; Mose Drachman, clerk of
the United States Court; Rev.
W. P. Smith, of the local Me
thodist church, and J. A. Le
garra, manager of Toe Red
House.
All the speakers pledged their
best efforts in behalf of the
Third Liberty Bond issue, and
Santa Cruz county's allotment,
289,500, will go "over the top,"
in tine shape.

There is more Catarrh in this section
of the country than all other diseases
put together, and for years it was sup
posed to be incurable. Doctors pre
scribed local remedies, and by constant
ly failing1 to cure with local treatment,
pronounced it incurable. Catarrh is a
local disease, greatly influenced by con
stitutional conditions and therefore re
quires constitutional treatment. Hall's
Catarrh Cure, manufactured by K. J.
Cheney & Co., Toledo, Ohio, is a consti
tutional remedy, is taken internally

The patriotic, meeting last
evening at Patagonia, which was
attended by many Nogales citi
zens, was a great success, and
to Mrs. Persis CoDmbs, principal
of the school, E'Jitor Keener and
all who assisted , unstinted praise
is due.
The program rendered by the
Patagonia school, would have
done credit to a town many times
the size of the little city on the
banks of the Sonoita.
One of the most delightful
musical numbers on the long,
interesting program arranged by
Mrs. Coombs, was a song by
Mrs. Gillespie, assisted by Miss
Ruth Mclniery.
After the patriotic program,
by the school, the meeting was
turned over to the Santa Cruz
County Council of Defense, pre
sided o?er by Editor Howard
Keener, who in a few well chosen
remarks, explained the objects
of the meeting.
The first speaker introduced,
was Collector of Customs C. E.
Hardy, who made one of the
best patriotic speeches ever
heard in the county. The speak
er made a strong plea in favor
of the Third Liberty Loan, the
Thrift Stamps and Red Cross,
the support of which means so
much for our boys ' over there."
Rev. W. H. Smith, of the Me
thodist church, made a wonder
ful address, during which he
took the cuticle off the Kaiser,
and other enemies of the liberty
loving peoples of the earth. Be
sides being an orator of the old
school, Rev. Smith is a clever
story teller.
During the organization of a
Patagonia branch of the Council
of Defense, and a heart to heart
talk in behalf of the Bonds, etc.,
excellent coffee and good things
to eat were served by the ladies
of Patagonia, who, as entertain
ers, can't be beat.
The Patagonia meeting was a
great success, in every way.
