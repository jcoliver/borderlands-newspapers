The Spirit of Friendship.
This store looks upon its patrons not
merely as customers but as friends.
People purchase here because they
have friendly feeling for this store.
The cause which develops this friendly
feeling, may differ, in fact, they are
sure to differ. One's friendship for
the store is the result of finding good
values; another's is the result of effi
cient service and courteous treatment,
and so on.
Naturally this friendshiply feeling on
the part of our patrons is reciprocated
on our part. And this spirit of mutual
friendship is an impetus for greater
service and an incentive to ever-increasing
endeavor to make this store
a place where every visitor will feel
perfectly at home.

methods for showing fanciers,
and even experienced handlers
of poultry the latest and best
methods for bringing to early
maturity the best of the stock.
Lessons learned in the hard
school of experience will be
given the farmers and poultry
breeders at first hand. Because
of this exhibit, the farmer is to
have an opportunity in December
to go to school to those who
have made a life study of the
best methods of rearing stock.
POULTRY DAY AT THE FAIR.
Poultry and poultry products
are to have an important place
at the Arizona State Fair which
will be held in Phoenix Decem
ber 2 to 9. An entire building
is to be given over to an exhibit
which promises to be the largest
ever shown in this state and
probably in the entire west.
Awards made at this exhibit
are to be highly valued because
of the keen competition. No
matter what strain of poultry,
the exhibitor may have to show,
the award will have been won
only after the keenest competi
tion. Poultry breeders from all
over Arizona are showing a de
sire to have a part in the coming
exhibit.
The government has sent out
an insistent and more than ur
gent request that the people of
this country keep more hens.
Laws have been made limiting
the killing of laying biddies.
As a result this exhibit is to
have a peculiar interest in that
it will offer the latest and best
TO THE GOOD PEOPTE OF SAN
TA CRUZ COUNTY.
I am reminded of the heroic
lines of Sir Walter Scott:
"Breathes there a man with
soul so dead,
Who never to himself has said,
This is my own native land."
It seems to me that a man
would possess a dead soul in
deed who would not be proud of
Santa Cruz county in the Fourth
Liberty Loan Drive.
I assured Mr. Hoopes of the
Federal Reserve Bank at Dallas
that this county would do its
duty, and you have more than
done it.
The 19th day of October is the
proudest day in the military his
tory of the United States be
cause on that day in the year
1781 Cornwall is surrendered at
Yorktown to Washington and
Lafayette; and our fourth drive
winding up on the anniversary
of such a day could not fail
while the American heart beats
true to the principles of the De
claration of Independence.
To Hon. Bracey Curtis and his
stalwart cohorts of drive work
ers particular credit is due and
I want to thank him and them,
and all who contributed to the
great success. Men's committees
and Women's committees, and
Mexican neighbors, individuals,
merchants, business men, bank
ers, farmers, cattlemen, miners,
laborers, mechanics of all kinds,
railroad section men and every
body who in any way helped the
great cause all over the county
of Santa Cruz and elsewhere.
You have helped to flash
across the sea to General Persh
ing and the boys over there the
only message worthy of a great
people:
"The Fourth Liberty Loan
Over Subscribed."
Respectfully,
W. A. O'Connor,
Chairman Liberty Loan Drive
Committee in and for Santa
Cruz County, Arizona.
LET ARIZONA LEAD
Roth aive ALL the money to the injured person none to the uninjured lawyer. Arizona's Amendment 100 will giv
lore and is better, but if you don't adopt it I may have to substitute mine. Things cannot go on as they have ben.
Progress is the word, and state insurance is PROGRESS."
VOTE THE DEMOCRATIC TICKET
The State Democratic Central
Committee are sending out from
their headquarters, Phoenix, to
every -voter in the state a copy
of the party platform that was
adopted by the Partj' Council at
Phoenix, October 1, 1918. The
platform contains the names of
all of the state candidates as
well as the names of the county
candidates of each county. It
also contains a written opinion
by the Attorney General, Hon.
Wiley E. Jones, relative to the
eligibility of the Hon. Fred. T.
Colter to hold the office of Gov
ernor. Accompanying the plat
form is a Statement of Facts
gotten out by Senator Colter as
well as a letter from him accept
ing the platform ot the party in
its entirely as an enunciation of
the principles and policies for
which he stands.
Every Democratic voter should
read the platform carefully as it
is an inspiring document and
should appeal to all who take an
interest in the progress of pol
itical science and the cause of
true liberty. In order to uphold
the hands of President Wilson
under the present critical situa
tion it is necessary to elect men
for office who will loyally sup
port the President in the pro
secution of the war and who are
in full sympathetic accord with
his policies in both peace and
war.
From the beginning of our
history American statesmen have
held consistently to the view
that the President in time of
war should have a Congress of
his own political faith to aid him
as Commander in Chief of the
Army and Navy. If the repub
licans score a telling victory and
elect republican Congressmen
and Governors in democratic
states, it will be viewed by the
nations of Europe from one
standpoint; they will draw no
fine distinction. A refusal to
sustain the President this year
will in their eyes be regarded as
a refusal to sustain the war. In
such a campaign no democrat
worthy of the franchise should
neglect his privilege to vote and
cast his ballot to hold up the
hands of the stalwart American
in the White House and see that
his friends and neighbors do the
same. If this democratic state,
which two years ago gave Pre
sident Wilson a majority of ten
thousand votes, should in this
election fail to give a decisive
majority to any democratic can
didate, it would be a rebuke to
the President and a repudiation
of his war policy. It is up to
the democrats of the state of
Arizona to approve or disap
prove the administration of Pre
sident Wilson. Democrats, do
your duty! Vote the ticket
straight.

On November 5th, Vice Chair
man Lou Koller and Secretary
Tom Wylie of the County Dem
ocratic Central Committee, will
deliver the goods.
Charley P. Lopez, is one of
the best peace officers Nogales
ever had. His re election to the
office of Constable, on the Demo
cratic ticket, is assured.
Last Tuesday President Wil
son sent to Hon. George Babbitt,
Chairman of the State Demo
cratic Central Committee, the
following telegram: "Congress
man Hayden has in every way
been loyal to the country. He
has supported my administra
tion most loyally, and I should
deem his defeat a distinct loss
to the cause we are all fighting
for."
Arcus Reddoch, the unbeat
able incumbent of the office of
county recorder since Arizona
became a state, is a nominee on
the Democratic ticket ' for re
election. That he'll be elected
no one doubts for a moment.
Arcus is acknowledged about the
best little county recorder in
Arizona, a fact everybody who
has business in the recorder's of
fice, well knows. Arcus couldn't
lose of he tried.
Howard Keener, of Patago
nia, successful newspaperman
and dry farmer in the San Ra
fael valley, is making a splendid
race for the office of County
Treasurer, on the Democratic
ticket. Mr. Keener has the abil
ity; he is honest and pains-taking
in everything he does. Vot
ers of Santa Cruz county will
make no mistake by casting their
ballot for Howard Keener for
county treasurer.
Oscar P. Ashburn, of Pata
gonia, nominee on the Democra
tic ticket for supervisor, can be
depended upon to serve the tax
payers in the same pains-taking
manner he served them when he
was a member of that honorable
body a number of years ago.
Mr. Ashburn favors good roads,
for every section of the county,
and those who are foi goods
roads, are not going to forget
him on election day.
Victor J. Wager, vho after
two terms faithful service in the
county assessor's office, . during
which he has made a state-wide
reputation for efficiency, is again
a candidate for re-election on the
Democratic ticket. A man of
Vic-Wager's ability could make
lots more money out of the as
sessor's office, but his friends
just won't let him go. They in
sist he must hold the job down
another term. He'll win without
opposition.
Voters of Santa Cruz county,
especially those who are inter
ested inthe public schools, have
long ago decided how they are
going to vote for school super
intendent, November 5. Since
Arizona became a state Mrs.
Josephine A. Saxon, a pioneer
resident of Nogales and vicinity,
where she taught school many
years, has served as school su
perintendent,most faithfully and
well. A lifelong educator her
self, Mrs. Saxon understands
fully the needs of our public
schools. Everybody knows and
loves "Mother" Saxon. Why
would onyone cast a vote against
her?
Amendment 100 Will Hold the Married Men
Robt E. Lee, Democratic no
minee for Clerk of the Superior
Court, is one of the most thor
oughly competent men for that
office in Arizona. For nearly
seven years Mr. Lee has served
as Official Court Reporter, and
Deputy Clerk in the same court.
Hundreds of judges, lawyers,
and, in fact everybody who has
business in Court, can attest to
Mr. Lee's wonderful ability and
splendid personality. He has a
thorough knowledge of the busi
ness of the Clerk's office. He
will be elected by a big majority.
Jas. L. Pinley, of Canille,
nominee on the Democratic ticket
for a place on the board of su
pervisors, is here circulating
among his friends Republicans
and Democrats. Jim Pinley is
one of Santa Cruz county's best
known successful business men.
As a rancher and farmer he has
made good, and as a member of
the board of supervisors, asso
ciated with J. A. Harrison and
Oscar P. Ashburn, he'll care
fully guard the interest of every !
taxpayer, no matter where he
resides in Santa Cruz county.
Jim was raised in this county
and knows the county's needs.
His election is assured.
Hon. W. A. O'Connor, Demo
cratic nominee for the high office
of Judge of the Superior Court,
is too well known to every voter
in Santa Cruz county to need an
introduction. He is one of the
county's pioneers. As principal
of the Nogales public schools,
as Probate Judge and ex-officio
county school superintendent, as
district attorney, and as Judge
of the Superior Court, which
exalted position he now occu
pies, W. A. O'Connor has made
an enviable record. He is a
high-class attorney at law, and
as a fair and impartial judge, is
held in high esteem in every
county in the great state of Arizona.

'NO TIME TO SWAP HORSES.'
In Mr. R. R. Ear b art, the
sheriff of Santa Cruz county,
who is the Democratic nominee
for re election, the people of
this political subdivision have a
fine officer with a record of one
who doss his duty, and his whole
duty, without fear or favor.
Mr. Earhart has been identi
fied with Santa Cruz county a
dozen years, and in that time he
has proven his worth in more
ways than one. In the days
when the Mowry Mines were
operating under the Curtis Do
nau management, Mr. Earhart
was in the employ of that corp
oration as master mechanic.
Then he was keeper of the prop
erty while it was in the courts b
number of years, discharging
the trust im nosed, in him with I
With the first election he was
elected County Treasurer, and
he was run so close in the elec
tion, and his majority was so
slight that he faced a contest to
demonstrate his right to the
office. He won, and in his in
cumbency he discharged the
duties of the post with such
tact, judgment and accuracy
that for the second term the
Republicans could find no one
who would try conclusions with
him, and he was elected without
opposition.
Takiniy thf. nomination for
sheriff two years ago Mr. Ear- f
hart beat one of the strongest!
and most popular Republicans
in the county, who had served
two terms.
In the present election Mr.
Earhart is standing upon his
record as a faithful and loyal
servant, and he is sure to win.
This is one of those cases de
scribed by Abe Lincoln, when
he said that "it is no time to
swap horses when crossing a
stream." Oasis.

been initiated.
IT PROVIDES:
State senators will continue to be
elected at large, as are United

No county will have a smaller re

Every 1500 votes, cast for the can

lower house of the state legislature.
Boards of supervisors, six months
before each election, shall district
each county according to the vote.

of Nogales, who is the party
nominee for State Representa
tive, says Wednesday morning's
Oasis.
He is one of the most capable
and efficient men in the county.
as his success in business demon
strates most lully. Mis career
in the international border region
goes back many years. For
more than twenty years be was
in the service of the Sonora
Rail way, filling the post of agent
at Guaymas, Ortiz, Torres, Her
znosillo, Carbo, Pesquiera, Mag
dalena, Ouijano and Nogales, a
record that would be hard to
duplicate anywhere.
Some six years ago Mr. Bow
man quit the railway service
and embarked in business on his
own account, first engaging in
cattle importation from Mexico,
handling many thousand head
within a few months, and mak
ing handsome returns. He en
gaged later in merchandising,
which he still conducts the
Bowman Mercantile Company.
Mr. Bowman is also a heavy
property owner, having improv
ed some of the choicest parcels
in the city. The Hotel Bowman
on Grand avenue, is one of the
finest buildiDgs in Southern Ari
zona, and his fine residence on
Cavalry Hill, is an ornament to
the city.
The gentleman is an all around
good citizen and a highly repre
setative man. He should be
elected.
