The Spirit of Friendship.
This store looks upon its patrons not
merely as customers but as friends.
People purchase here because they
have friendly feeling for this store.
The cause which develops this friendly
feeling, may differ, in fact, they are
sure to differ. One's friendship for
the store is the result of finding good
values; another's is the result of effi
cient service and courteous treatment,
and so on.
Naturally this friendshiply feeling on
the part of our patrons is reciprocated
on our part. And this spirit of mutual
friendship is an impetus for greater
service and an incentive to ever-increasing
endeavor to make this store
a place where every visitor will feel
perfectly at home.

ARIZONA NOTES.
Items of Interest Culled From Our
Exchanges.
With the filing of 12 more suits
for damages in behalf of men
deported from Bisbee in connec
tion with the deportation of 1,
180 striking copper miners and
their alleged sympathizers, July
12, 1917, the total number of
claims for damage on tile in the
office of the clerk of the superior
court in Tombstone was raised
to 28G. while the money involv
ed is $6,150,000.
The Hayden Rifle club now
has forty members. The local
club is affiliated with the nation
al organization. Assurance from
the government has been receiv
ed that guns and ammunition
may be had according to the re
gulations. Requisitions will be
made in the near future. Work
will begin on the range imme
diately in order to have every
thing ready for business when
the arms arrive
The tax showing in Maricopa
county is far better than in 1917,
the increase being in excess of
$15,000,000. The entire taxable
property of the state will show
an increase over that of last
year, although many of the busi
ness houses have been hard hit
by the war. Mining industries
and railroads necessarily show
big increases, and next year the
increase will be more pronounced
on account of the big prices of
metal, and increases in freight
rates.
Casa Grande, Red Rock, Sas
co, Picacho, Toltec, Oracle and
Mammoth have been transferred
to the jurisdiction of the Pima
county food administration,
through an order issued by State
Food Administrator T. A. Rior
dan. The change is said to have
been based upon the convenience
of the dealers of the Pinal coun
ty towns along the line of the
Southern Pacific, who are not
accustomed to buying at Ray,
the former center of control.
The action concentrates the pur
chasing power of these towns in
Tucson.
The record of Morenci, Ari
zona, in regard to enlistments
most effectually spikes the usual
stories that drift out regarding
mining communities. Morenci
has furnished for the cause of
democracy 232 men, and when it
is considered that at the last
general election there were but
800 votes cast by both men and
women, the number of enlist
ments stands out as a remark
able figure. Some publicity has
been made regarding unpatriotic
acts in some mining communi
ties, but nothing can be said
against the patriotism of Mo
renci. A report on acreage for 1918
for Arizona by counties has been
issued by L. M. Harrison, field
agent for the United States de
partment of agriculture. For
the state the acreage in nearly
all the leading crops is ahead of
last year. This is especially
noticeable in cotton, corn, wheat,
barley, beans, grain sorghums,
oats and potatoes. The state
estimates are corn 34,000 acres;
wheat, 38,000 acres; barley, 30,
000 acres; cotton, 92,000 acres;
alfalfa, 125,000 acres; beans, 20,
000 acres; grain sorghums, 30,
000 acres; oats, 11,500 acres;
potatoes, 5,420 acres.
Farmers in sections where the
acreage of wheat is unusually
large are urged by the depart
ment of Agriculture to provide
enough bins on the farms to
take care of their wheat when
threshed. This is said to be ne
cessary to save the wheat that
will probably pile up in certain
localities, because the large crop
is likely to put a heavy strain
on storage elevators and trans
portation systems. The wheat
should be stored in bins on the
farm, according to the Bureau
of Markets, which has issued a
circular containing plans and
drawings for a portable bin that
can be quickly built. Copies of
this circular have been distri
buted to county agents through
out the large wheat producing
sections.
NO AGE LIMIT FOR HIM.
J. W. Lively, a Cochise coun
ty rancher, 80 years old, who
has the distinction of having
voted twice for Abraham Lin
coln for presidont, being a vet
eran of the Civil War, has vol
unteered his services as a ship
caulker for the United States
shipping board. He is now wait
ing fr assignment but will not
go to Texas because the mos
quitoes are too big down there.
He prefers to work in one of the
Pacific coast shipyards. Because
of his advanced age, Lively was
obliged to give a guarantee that
he could do as much work as a
young man. "If I don't. I want
them to fire men without any
pay," he said this morning, "but
I am sure I can caulk as fast as
anybody. My father was a ship
builder on the Atlantic coast
and I learned shipbuilding in
my boyhood." Prospector.
Soldier and Sailor Insurance.
Secretary McAdoo has receiv
ed the following cablegram from
General Pershing:
"All ranks of the American
Expeditionary Forces appreciate
deeply the generous measure
the Government has taken to
provide insurance for their fami
lies, in proof of which more than
90 per cent of men have taken
out insurance. To wisely pro
vision for their loved ones heart
ens our men and strengthens
the bonds that unite the army
and people in our strong deter
minatioa to triumph in our most
righteous cause."
The Bureau of War Risk In
surance up to June 28 has writ
ten $21,566,000,000 insurance,
representing 2,570,455 applica
tions. The average amount of
insurance applied for is $8,387,
and in some in France and some
here, every man has taken out
insurance. In some units every
man is insured for the maximum
$10,000.
One of the American generals
says that this Government in
surance is an element of victory.
All Liberty Bond holders and all
purchasers of War Savings
Stamps may feel that they had
a part in this insurance the
most just and humane provision
ever made by any nation for its
fighting men.
State Council Defense Meeting.
The State Council of Defense
held its first meeting at Phoenix
last Monday. There were nine
of the fourteen counties repre
sented, A. C. Cooling of Oatman,
the member for Mohave county,
attending the meeting. The
other members were Charles E.
Adams, Pinal county; William
Neagle, Navajo county; Mrs.
Inez Lee, Graham county; W.
D. Claypool, Gila county; Jas.
L. Edwards, Yuma county; Mrs.
Theodora Marsh, Santa Cruz
county; Homer Wood, Yavapai
county; Dwight B. Heard, Mari
copa county; Governor Hunt is
chairman of the council. The
council did not complete its
work, preferring, we suppose to
await the arrival of the other
five members. Dwight B. Heard,
who was chairman of the old
council of defense, outlined the
work that the council had to do
and suggested a complete plan
of organization. The new coun
cil will be of great value in the
war work of the state and will
be of benefit in furtherance of
the national plan of extending
the work down to the smallest
county units. Miner.
Bonds of the Fourth Liberty Loan.
Bonds of the Fourth Liberty
Loan are now being turned out
by the thousands daily by the
Treasury's Bureau of Engraving
and Printing. The bonds are
similar in form and design to
those of the third loan, and
space has been left on each bond
for insertion of the exact terms
of the bonds.
It is believed that a sufficient
number of the bonds will be
ready to make possible imme
diate delivery of all bonds of
the fourth loan as they are purchased.
HAYDEN FOR REPRESENTATIVE
When you cast your vote at
the next election for congress
man see that you place an X
after the name of Carl Hayden,
who has represented the state
during the stormy period before
and during the entry of the Un
ited States into the war. Con
gressman Hayden has upheld
the honor and dignity of the na
tion and has backed the admin
istration in all its war purposes
and should be returned without
opposition. No man has been
more faithful than he, and no
matter what the opposition may
say he is the one man for the
place. In these days when de
mocrats are endorsing loyal re
publicans it looks out of place
for the republicans of Arizona
under subterfuge to try to boost
a less able and less loyal man
into bis place. To be true to
themselves the republicans
should give Mr. Hayden their
endorsement, because he has
been true to the state and his
country, and because they have
no one in the party who can
even make a race worth while.
Miner.
JAIL BIRDS MUST WORK.
Prison labor of Arizoua is to
be utilized in an effort to over
come, so far as it is possible, the
acute labor shortage in this
state.
Instead of able bodied men
spending their time idly in the
state penitentiary, they are to
assist in the industries of this
state, especially in the agricul
tural and horticultural industries
which are declared to be suffer
ing from a lack of help.
This was accomplished through
a resolution offered by Wiley E
Jones, attorney genera', a mem
ber of the state board of pardons
and paroles, and adopted by that
board at a meeting held at Flor
ence. Present at this meeting
besides Attorney General Jones,
was Curt W. Miller of Tempe,
chairman of the board. C. O.
Case, superintendent of public
instruction, the third member of
the board, is absent in California.
Seven Amendments to Go Upon Ballot
With the close of the final day
for the filing of petitions in the
office of secretary of state to in
itiate matters of legislation to
be voted on at the next election,
it was made certain that the
voters of Arizona, at the elec
tion in November, are to have
the privilege of casting their
ballots for or against seven
amendments, four of them con
stitutional and three statutory.
No petition lacked sufficient
names to place it on the ballot
next November. One received
nearly 16,000 signatures and one
nearly 13,000. Following are
the questions that are to be
voted on:
The workmen's compensation
act, a constitutional amendment,
petition contained 15,588 names.
Theanti vaccination act, a sta
tutory amendment, petition con
taining 7,313 names. Act to
make it illegal to vaccinate any
school child without the consent
of the parents.
The capital punishment act, a
statutory amendment, petition
containing 7,552 names, to make
capital punishment a legal sen
tence in the first degree murder
convictions.
The legislative redisricting
act, a constitutional amendment,
containing 12,825 names.
Three acts relative to the sale,
leasing and management of state
lands. Blade-Tribune.

The readers of this paper will be
pleased to learn that there is at least
one dreaded disease that science has
been able to cure in all its stages, and
that is catarrh. Catarrh being greatly
influenced by constitutional conditions
requires constitutional treatment.
Hall's Catarrh Cure is taken internally
and acts thru the Blood on the Mucous
Surfaces of the System thereby de
stroying the foundation of the disease,
giving the patient strength by building
up the constitution and assisting na
ture in doing its work. The proprie
tors have so much faith in the curative
powers of Hall's Catarrh Cure that
they offer One Hundred Dollars for any
case that it fails to cure. Send for list

CALLED HER FAMILY
TO HER BEDSIDE
Six Years Ago, Thinking She Might Die7 Says Texas Lady, But Nov
She Is a Well, Strong Woman and Praises Cardui For
Her Recovery.
Royse City. Tex. Mrs. Mary Kll
msn, of this place, says; "After the
birth of my little girl... my side com
menced to hurt me. I had to go back
to bed. We called the doctor. lie
treated me... but I got no better. I
got worse and worse until the misery
was unbearable...! was iu bed for
three months and suffered such agony
that I was just drawn up In a knot. . .
I told my husband If he would get
me a bottle of Cardui I would try it. . .
I commeaced taking it, however, that
evening I called my family about
me. . . for I knew I could not last
many days unltess I had a change for :
the better. That was six years ago
and I am still here and am a well,
strong woman, and I owe my life to
Cardui. I had only taken half tho
bottle when I began to feel better.
The misery in my side got less... I
continued right on taking the Cardui
until I had taken thiee bottles and I
did not need any more for I was well
and never felt better in my life... I
have never had any trouble from that
day to this."
Do you suffer from headache, back
ache, pains In sides, or other discom
forts, each month? Or do you feel
weak, nervous and fagged-out? If so,
