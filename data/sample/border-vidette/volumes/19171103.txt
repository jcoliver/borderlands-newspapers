The resolution passed by the
joint houses of Congress relative
to the elimination of assessment
for mining claims for the years
1917 1918 has caused many pros
pectors to wonder just what the
process should be in properly
filing and recording their inten
tion to hold the claim. The re
solution stated that the claimant
must file notice of his desire to
hold said claim under this reso
lution on or before December
31st of each of the years.
The Arizona State Bureau of
Mines in anticipation of this pos
sible confusion on the part of
the prospector, has issued spe
cial blanks for this purpose.
These may be obtained by writ
ing to C. F. Willis, director,
Arizona State Bureau of Mines.

Tnere is a chance now for any

ty securing a sufficient number
of stenographers and typewrit

ASKS SUBSTITUTION.
C. W. Crist Preaches Clean Plate and
Empty Garage Pail.
Charles W. Crist, special ro
presentative of Herbert C. Hoov
er, national food administrator,
spoke at the Santa Cruz club
last Saturday evening and at
the Congregational church Sun
day morning. He7 came here
from Sonoita, where he made an
address at tne County Pair.
At the Santa Cruz Club, among
other interesting things, Mr.
Crist said:
"This is my first trip to the
great southwest," he said and I
have been wonderfully impress
ed with your country and your
people. You seem to have con
siderable space in these parts
and I find it difficult indeed to
get used to distances," he added
laughingly.
"Conservation is an old word
now and the public has been
educated up to its meaning.
What we are especially empha
sizing now is substitution as well
as conservation. Wheat, meat,
dairy products, fats and sugar
are the five items for which sub
stitutions must be made, because
these are the products that are
needed in Europe if we are to
win this war.
"This organization work in
Arizona is being much better
conducted than in New Mexico.
There the campaign is being
carried on through the schools
while in Arizona the adults are
taking the lead. Considerable
rivalry exists between the vari
ous counties and between the
states. It goes without saying
that the state, county, or com
munity securing the largest num
ber of pledges in proportion to
the population can be regarded
as the most patriotic.
."The public should be warned
against the activities of pro
German propagandists which al
ready have cropped out in this
state. At Phoenix one person is
known to have distributed liter
ature in the form of folders in
serted in magazines for sale at
the news stands in which house
wives were warned not to sign
the cards if they did not want to
be drafted for service or heavily
taxed."
MUSICAL TREAT.
A. W. Lohn Delightfully Entertains His
Friends at Lyric Theatre.
A. W. Lohn, the popular pho
tographer who is local dealer
for the famous Edison Diamond
Disc, last Tuesday evening enter
tained hundreds of music lovers
at the Lyric theatre.
The big play house was crowd
ed with invited guests, who as
sembled to hear Madame Odette
Le Pontenay, the famous so
prano, assisted by Miss Dorothy
Hoyle. a popular violinist, who
is associated with Thomas Edi
son. Last Tuesday night's recital
was unique. It was a so called
"Tone Test" between Madame
Le Fontenay and Mr. Edison's
laboratory re creation of her
voice.
Madame LePontenay stood be
side Edison's latest and famous
invention, the New Edison.
When Madame LePontenay com
menced the first selection it was
easy to understand why she is a
favorite wherever she appears.
Her voice is luscious and sym
pathetic throughout its entire
register, a voice totally different
from the familiar tones of a talk
ing machine. Amazement, there
fore, was written on the faces of
the audience when Madame Le
Fontenay 's lips ceased to move
and the re-created voice con
tinued the same voice, enuncia
tion, tone color, identical in
every detail, with the possible
exception of volume. Madame
LeFontenay finished the song,
pausing from time to time with
the same result, and unless one
watched her lips it was impossi
ble to know when she paused.
Miss Hoyle gave similar illus
trations with her violin playing
with re-creation of violin solos
by Messrs. Carl Flesch and Al
bert Spaulding. Allowing for
the difference of tones in the
different violins, Miss Hoyle's
playing and the sounds that
emanated from the New Edison
were generally alike.

Catarrh Cannot Be Cured
with LOCAL APPLICATIONS, as they
cannot reach the seat of the disease.
Catarrh is a local disease, greatly in
fluenced by constitutional conditions,
and in order to cure it you must
take an internal remedy. Hall's Ca
tarrh Cure is taken internally and
acts thru the blood on the mucous sur
faces of the system. Hall's Catarrh
Cure was prescribed by one of the best
physicians in this country for years. It
is composed of some of the best tonics
known, combined with some of the
best blood purifiers. The perfect com
bination of the ingredients in Hall's
Catarrh Cure Is what produces such
wonderful results in catarrhal condi
tions. Send for testimonials, free.

The Redwine cow ranch, lying

prising nearly twelve thousand
acres, partly fenced, controled
by R. R. Redwine. in a few
years will become one of the
most valuable in this section.
With an abundance of good
feed and excellent water, well
and spring, the Redwine herd of
whiteface, is sleek and fat. They
come home for water and salt,
and all the happy Redwine
family does, most of the time, is
enjoy the "simple life," and
watch 'em grow.
The run from Nogales to the
Redwine Place, with Jake Red
wine at the wheel of the Red
wine Ford Special, was made
last Saturday in one hour and
twenty minutes, flat, which
Master Robert Redwine said was

uncle Jake, who formerly ran a
locomotive engine on the Oregon
Short Line.
There is plenty of milk and
honey, and everything, at the
Redwine cow ranch, where the
latch string is always out in true
southern fashion.
Wish we could go back and

good friends, the Red wines.

better, what more could a race
horse fan demand than the offer
ings of the State Fair meeting
at Phoenix November 12 17.

in purses for the harness races
and all the speedy horses on the
Grand Circuit, Great Western
and other circuits will be at the

another fast pacing race to be
known as the Capital City
Stakes. The purses for these
races are $2500 each.

STOMACH TROUBLE
Mr. Marion Holcomb, of Nancy, Ky., says: "For quite
a hong while I suffered with stomach trouble. I would
have pains and a heavy feeling after my meals, a most
disagreeable taste in my mouth. If I ate anything with
butter, oil or grease, I would spit it up. I began to have
regular sick headache. I had used pil's and tablets, but
after a course of these, I would be constipated. It just
seemed to tear my stomach all up. I foimd they were
no good at all for my trouble. I heard
THEDFORD'S
recommended very highly, so began to use it. It cured
me. I keep it in the house all the time. It is the best
liver medicine made. 1 do not have sick headache or
stomach trouble any more." Black-Draught acts on
the jaded liver and helps it to do its important work of
throwing out waste materials and poisons from the sys
tem. This medicine should be in every household for
use in time of need. Get a package today. If you feel
sluggish, take a dose tonight. You will feel fresh to
morrow. Price 25c a package. All druggists.
