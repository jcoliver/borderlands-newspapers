DON'T GET IN THE WAY
Are you dointr what you
all things, do not get in the way of the Government.
If we are going to continue to call on lahor, to call on
the supply of raw material, to take up shop room, to make
those things that we have been in the habit of asking for; if
we are going to continue to demand the things of luxury, of
comfort, of convenience that we have been in the habit of
demanding, the Government is going to fail to do this job and
you are going to paralize the blow when the Government
come to strike it, because it will not have equipped this army
as it shotild.
We must so handle our personal affairs that we do not
become competitors with the Government for those things
that the Government must have.
There are three things you can do with a dollar : You can
hoard it, you can spend it, or you can invest it. Now, a hoard
ed dollar is an idle dollar, and today, with capital needed, it is
a drag on a community, just as an idle man is a drag on a com
munity. An idle dollar is a slacker. But there is something
worse than a slacker. A slacker is not doing anything active
ly to defeat the N ation's purposes, but a dollar that you spend
needlessly, a dollar that employs labor or consumes material
in competition with the Government, is an ally of the enemy
it is a traitor dollar. " That is the way we have got to weigh
our expenditures. We have got to analyze day after day what
we are doing with our money.
When we buy things that are unnecessary, we are post
poning the day that these ships will be ready; that they will
be manned; that they will begin to take any great number of
our men to the fields of France.
Now, let us see what an invested dollar is like: You
pay this month or next S4. 12 for one of these WAR-SAVING
STAMPS. When you buy it, it is attached to a certificate
that has on it a place for twenty stamps. Your name is
written on the certificate and after you Jiave attached your
first stamp your rights are as complete as they will be at any
time, should you fill the certificate or any number of stamps
less than twenty. Now, what are these rights? If you hold
the certificate for five years you get Five Dollars from the
Government for every stamp attached. That means four per
cent interest; but if you want your money, you can get it at
any Post Office.
Do you realize that we are a nation of spendthrift peo
ple? Our savings do not compare per capita with those of
much poorer countries. Sweden has five times as much sav
ings per capita as we have in this country, and so has Switzer
land. We have fifteen million depositors in savings banks
and we shall shortly see thirty million holders of these War
Savmgs Certificates. That will mean something; it will mean
thirty million stock holders in .the United States, and thereby
thirty million better voters and better citizens.
Again, we say, do not. get in the way of the Govern
ment, because we want our army equipped as speedily as pos
sible;we want to make their sacrifice as effective as possible; we
want as many of them to return as possible; and we want to
give them all the protection that complete equipment in arma
ment can give so you see that you have larger duties of
citizenship than you have ever had before, and you should
control your expenditures so that you leave the Government
free right-of-way. The First National Bank of Nogales.
WHERE THE U. S. STANDS.
Nation Pledged to Righting Wrongs
and Safety of People.
Tn his recent address to Con-
erress. President Wilson outlined
fourteen specific considerations
forming a program for world
peace. They were as follows:
1 Onen convenants of peace
without private international un
derstandings.
2 Absolute freedom ot the
seas in peace or war, except as
thev may be closed by interna
tional action.
3 Removal of all economic
barriers and establishment of
equality of trade conditions
among nations consenting to
peace and associating themselves
for its maintenance.
4 Guarantees for the reduc
tion of national armaments to the
lowest point consistent with do
mestic safetiT.
5 Impartial adjustment of all
colonial claims, based upon the
principle that the people con
cerned have equal weight with
the interest of the government.
6 Evacuation or all ixussian
territory and opportunity for
Russia s political development.
7 Evacuation of Belgium
without any attempt to limit her
sovereignty
8 All French territory to be
freed and restored and repara
tion for the taking of Alsace
Lorraine. 9 Readjustment of Italy's
frontiers along clearly recogniz
able lines of nationality.
10 Freest opportunity for au
tonomous development of the
people of Austria Hungary.
11 Evacuation of Rumania,
Servia and Montenegro, with ac
cess to the sea for Servia and in
ternational guarantees of eco
noinic and political independence
and territorial integrity of the
Balkan States.
12 Secure sovereignty for
OF THE GDVERNME'IT
can to help win the war
Of
Turkey's portion of the Ottoman
empire, but with other national
ities under Turkish rule assured
security of life and opportunity
for autonomous development,
with the Dardanelles perman
ently opened to all nations.
13 Establishment of an in
dependent Polish State, includ
ing territories inhabited by indis
putable Polish populations, with
free access to the sea and politi
cal economic independence and
territorial integrity guaranteed
by international convenant.
11 General association of na
tions under specific convenants
for mutual guarantees of politi
cal independence and territorial
integrity to large and small
states alike.
"For such arrangements and
covenants," said the president in
conclusion, ''we are willing to
fight and continue to fight until
they are achieved, but only be
cause we wish the right to pre
vail and desire a just and stable
peace."
Such a program he said, re
moved the chief provocations for
war.
"The moral climax of this, the
culminating and final war for
human liberty has come," said
the president, in ending his ad
dress, "and they (people of the
United States) are ready to put
j their own strength, their own
j highest purpose, their own in-
tegrity and devotion to the
I test."
RIPE CHERRIES IN JANUARY.
As an evidence of the unusual
ly warm weather of the past
month, we are informed of a
cherry tree in the yard of J. W.
Prisk at Chloride, that has ripen
ing cherries on it. Some trees
around the county are budding
out and if the weather remains
warm for another week we ex
pect to see orchards in bloom.
Mohave Miner.
NEWS OF THE MINES.
The Castle Butte mine is now
working two shifts, and is taking
out very fine copper ore. This
is one of the best prospects in
this district, and the able man
agement of the property is
responsible for the advancement
it is showing, it being in the
hands of practical mining men
of wide experience, Messrs.
Miller and Scheerer.
The development work being
done at the Arizona-European is
in high grade copper ore, and
the property is expected to open
up on a large scale as soon as
possible. Much work has been
done and is being done there,
and when, future mining history
is written thel'Arizona European
will have its name in a prominent
place on its pages.
Churn drilling is still in pro
gress at the Mansfield mine,
under the able supervision of
Mr. C. A. Pierce, who says the
showings so far are very satis
factory. The work will be con
tinued to determine the size and
richness os the ore bodies on the
properties.
Mr. Paul Mclntyre is again
on the rural route mail service,
his brother: Ralph having retired
temporarily to his ranch in
Parker Canyon. Paul has had a
good rest and is feeling much
better than he did before taking
a vacation.
Mr. F. A. Shaw has gone to
New York to interest, if possible,
eastern capital in some of the
rich prospects in the Patagonia
district. He will return in about
two weeks.
John Hoy, manager of the
Trench mine, went to Bisbee
Sunday, returning with two
miners for work at the Harshaw
camp. Things are picking up
around. Patagonia, and good
miners have no trouble in
securing employment here.

FLOWERS AND COTTON.
T. R. Spaulding of the valley
brought to the city a branch of
Egyptian cotton from the 50
acre tract owned by Ihimsel and
J. H. Spaulding, which bore
flowers, squares and mature cot
ton all in great profusion.
It is claimed that the Yuma
project is the only place in the
western Hemisphere that can
make a showing like this in the
early days of January.
The tract from which this
plant was taken produced more
than 25 bales of long staple last
year. The amount of cotton
already picked on the tract this
year is conservatively estimated
at 27 bales. It has been picked
over four times at intervals of
about two weeks and is .now
ready for another picking.
"There seems to be as much
cotton coming now as when
started to pick." said Spaulding.
Egyptian long staple cotton is
now selling at about 70 cents per
pound in Yuma, at which price
many growers are holding for-a
raise. At 70 cents, a bale of
cotton is worth $350. Yuma
Sun.
TOM WILL BS PAID.
There is no question in our
mind but what the next legislat
ure will by special appropriation
bill provide for the payment of a
salary to former Acting Governor
Thos. Campbell for the time he
occupied the gubernatorial chair
of this state. Arizona is not a
cheap skate state and we are not
a cheap skate people. Campbell
was largely a victim of a com
bination of combines; he gave
his time and filled the job just as
well as anyone who knew him
ever expected him to and not to
'nav him the salary would be un
fair and too small to think
about. Prescott Courier.
NOGALES WANTS YOU.
The cattlemen of this vicinity
are in receipt cf invitations from
the city of Nogales requesting
their attendance at the annual
meeting of the Arizona Cattle
Growers' Association.
Nogales is reported to be
making big preparations for the
entertainment of the cattlemen.
Owing to the need cf close
co opera' ion between the stock
men "of Arizona during these
war times, it is predicted by the
state o.'fijials of the cattlemen's
association that the meeting this
year will be more largely attend
ci than any previous meeting.
Tiirt convention will open on
Admission day, February 14th,
a"'' ha ic session the loth and
16th.
oecietarv of the Interior
Franklin K. Line has been in
vited to attend this meeting and
other prominent men will bo
present.
To 'stimulate attendance, the
association is to give away to
the cattleman holding the right
register number, a' valuable
riding outfit.
Nogales has had some ex
perience in the entertaining of
conventions and its reputation
for hospitality is known all over
the state. Patagonian.
New National Guard to be Organized.
Under an order made by
Governor Hunt the reserve
forces of the state are to be
organized under the direction of
Adjutant General Charles W.
Harris who is now in Washing
ton. The governor's order to
create a reserve'bataliion is as
follows:
1. Whereas, the United States
of America is at war with the
imperial German government
and one of its allies, and having
in view the possibility of conse
quent danger and the necessity
for proper protection against
possible interference with the
execution of the laws of this
state by agents of the enemy,
and to protect persons and pro
perty from violence of organized
forces of any nature- whatever,
I, Gc
of the
eo. W. P. Hunt, governor
State Arizona, by virtue
of the authority vested in me by
section 4, article 5, constitution
of the State of Arizona, which
requires me to take care that the
laws be faithfully executed, do
hereby authorize the organiza
tion of such units of the reserve
batallions provided for by the
millitary code of the state, as
may be necessary to maintain
the peace and dignity of the
state of Arizona.
2. All reserve organization
which shall be organized shall
be organized by direction of the
adjutant general of Arizona, and
shall be governed by such
regulations as shall be issued by
order of the commander-in-chief
or in conformance with the mili
tary code of the State of Arizona.
(Signed) G. W. P. Hunt,
Governor and Commander-in
Chief.
TAG YOURJSHOVEL DAY.
As an aid to the educational
campaign to save coal, the
United States Fuel Administra
tion has decided on January 30,
1918, as national "Tag Your
Shovel Day." On that day
school children will tie tags,
bearing instruction for coal sav
ing, to every shovel in the coun
try. This tag should remind each
man, women and child who uses
a coal shovel that every shovel
ful of coal saved means just so
much additional "power and help
and support for the American
soldier and sailor on the firing
line.
C. M. Shannon, Fual Adminis
trator for Arizona, is asking
every teacher to make frequent
talks to the children, pointing
out the great good that will
result if every child 'does its
part, and also talks on coal con
servation in general. The valu
able help rendered by school
children throughout the country
in the last Liberty Loan drive
shows that much good can be
accomplished through them, and
if all will heed Jthe ad vice printed
on the tags to be put on every
shovel by the school children on
"Tag Your Shovel Day," it
will aid materially in making up
the shortage of coal, estimated
at 50,000,000 toms by U. S. Fuel
Administrator.

WAS A BIG SUCCESS.
Smoker Utidar Auspices of Santa
Cruz Club Enjoyed by Many.
The Santa Cruz Club smoker
yesterday evening was attended
by a large representation of the
membership, and however con
sidered it was a very successful
function reflecting great credit
upon the entertainment com
inittee, of which Mr. R. Li
O'Neill of the-Daily Herald is the
chairman, says Wednesday
Morning's Oasis.
The proceedings opened with
a short address by Mr. O'lSTeill,
who outlined in well chosen
language, the object of the
smoker, adding that it would be
repeated every month.
The entertainmeat began with
appropriate songs by a quartette
embracing Chaplin Eusey, of the
Thirty fifth Infantry, Mr. R B.
Stevens, Clifton Whiles and Mr.
Durfee.
Then there was a wrestling
match between a couple of boys
who were dubbed "Mutt" and
"Jeff," which was interesting and
exciting, the youngsters display
ing a sciene that was surprising
in those of their age ten and
twelve years respectively.
Professor Dickinson of the
Arizona Bureau of Mines (State
University) made a short and
interesting address upon "Safe
ty First."
Then came Consul E. M. Law
ton of Nogales, Sonora, who had
been featured to sing; but the
gentleman side stepped that per
formance and amused the audi
ence with some rich and racy
jokes at the expense of some of
the gentlemen present.
The next number was a boxing
match between Garvey and
Harrett of the 35th Infantry,
which was a clever exhibition of
proficiency in the manly art.
A violin and concertina duet
by local talent was the next
number.
Then there came a pillow fight
between "Mutt" and Jeff," which
was a scream from start to finish;
and their stunt was followed by
others of the same kind by sol
diers of the Thirty-fifth. Mount
ed upon a carbon cylinder the
contestants pummeled each other
heartily with their pillows, their
sallies evoking rounds of laugh
ter, appause and cheers.
Then a lunch was served, after
which there came singing and
smoking, with more singing and
more smoking, until the hour
was late, when, the gathering
dispersed, all highly gratified
with the entertainment of the
evening, as provided by Chair
man O'Neill of the entertainment
committee, who was assisted
most ably by Mr. Williams of the
Y. M. C. A.
BRING HOME THE BACON.
After almost a month spent at
the National Capital, on govern
meat business, Collector of
Customs C. Li. Hardy and Wm.
T. Haley, the well known" news
paper man, who has been
appointed special agent of the
War Trade Board, with head
quarters at Nogales, returned
home the forepart of the week.
Both gentlemen report having
had a busy time in Washington,
where there is something doing
every minute these strenuous
war times. Colonel Hardy has
the distinction of having been
re-nominated and confirmed as
Collector of Customs for this
district, all in one day; which is
going some even for Colonel
Hardy, who has a reputation for
never going to sleep on any job,
especially where the government
is interested.
The appointment of Wmilliam
T. Haley to the important,
responsibly position, for which
he is thoroughly competent to
fill with credit to himsel and our
Uncle Sam, meets the hearty
approval of everyone, even those
who desired the position for one
of their friends. Bill Haley has
the ability and is honest. Dollars
to doughnuts, he makes good.
J. B. Bible, who recently
acquired the famous old Auster
litz mine in the Oro Blanco
district from Dr. A. H. Noon and
sons, has been a guest at The
National a couple of days this
week. He is making arrange
ments to operate the old produc
ing property.
VEAL, BEEF, LAMB, MUTTON.
Last Tuesday Timothy A.
Riordan, United States Pood
Administrator for Arizona, is
sued the following order which
will be welcome news to Arizona
meat eaters:
From now until March 13
these meats may be served with
every meal on every day whether
"meatless" or otherwise.
Under the new ruling of the
federal food administration the
term "meatless" has been made
to mean "porkless" for Ari
zonans until March 13.
All this is explained in a tele
gram received by Timothy A.
Riordan, federal food administra
tor for Arizona from Herbert
Hoover which reads as follows:
"Washington In view of the
animal situation iu Oregon,
Washington, Idaho, California,
Nevada and Arizona due prin
cipally to transportation as
discussed in detail at recent con
ference of Administrators here
we have reached the decision
that states mentioned may re
raoVe restrictions until March 13
on eating of beef, mutton, lamb
and veal on meatless days and
with meatless meals.
"The new conservation pro
gram designates porkless Tues
day Saturday together with one
porkless meal etch dt.y. In other
words beef, mutton, lamD, and
veal will be permitted, but no
pork, bacon, ham or lard should
be eaten on porkless days or
with porkless meals in the states
mentioned which we wish
adhered to closely. Hoover."
The official explanation of this
action is that both cattle and
sheep raisers were faced with
the situation of general drought
conditions on the one hand and
the lack of transportation vacili
ties on the other. The stock had
to be marketed at once or perish
and this was the situation as
presented by stock men at the
recent conference By lifting the
ban on the four meats in question
a local demand in the western
states affected is thereby creat
ed, and thus the situation which
was fast becoming critical is to
be remedied, it is hoped.
IMPORTANCE OF COAL IN WAR
Ever since man has employed
metal in his weapons of war, the
forge lias played an important
part in history, but never before
were there such gigantic forge
fires as those of today in Pitts
burgh, Bethlehem and other
American manufacturing cities.
There the great furnance fires
are kept flaming and roaring all
day and night that the guns and
shells so necessary to the safety
and success of our men in France
may be supplied. These great
fires that consume millions and
millions of tons of coal are the
liberty fires of today. It is the
patriotic duty of every American
man and woman to do all in his or
her power to conserve the avail
able coal supply for these fires.
Every bucket of coal saved at the
domestic fireside is a bucket of
coal heaped on the fires of
liberty.
The United States Fuel Ad
ministration has urged upon the
American people the necessity
for conserving coal and asked
that. its use be entirely dispensed
with where possible. This re
quest if complied with will
strengthen our country in two
vitally important ways: First it
will make more certain the
supply of coal needed to manu
facture munitions, second, it will
relieve the railroads of the strain
of moving coal for domestic use
when there are other and more
important things for them to
apply their equipment to for the
successful prosecution of the
war.
Here in the western part of
the country the use of coal is
particularly serious, for it has
to be brought to us over many
hundreds of miles from Utah and
Wyoming. We have available
supplies of wood and oil and
these should be used in prefer
ence to coal wherever possible.
Oil heaters and Pearl Oil should
be more generally used, for they
supply an excellent, steady heat
at low cost and keep the house
comfortable in cold weather
without recourse to the use of
coal so vital to the world's cause
of liberty at the present time.
E. E. Noon, the well known
mining engineer, was a visitor
at home with the family a couple
of days this week, from the
Yellow Jacket mine in the Ore
Blanco district. Mr. Noon, who
is superintendent of the mine,
graduated a number of years
ago from the Arizona School of
Mines. He has since been con
nected with some of the big min
ing companies of Mexico, as
superintendent and consulting
engineer.

worth of treasury stock, the price
of which .is only 25 cents per
share. It's easily work fifty.

ARIZONA NOTES.
Items of Interest Culled From Our
Exchanges.
Governor Hunt has- announced
that he will not be a candidate
for the office next fall. He makes
this early declaration so that all
the boys in the state who have
an itching to fill the place can
begin their activities to land the
job. The governor probably
would like to spend a few da.vs
in the closing 5'ears ot his life in
the peaceful pursuit of content
meat and happiness, far removed
from the howling band of place
hunters and scheming poli
ticians. Winslow Mail.
The next annual meeting of
the Southwestern Cattle Grow
ers association will be held at
Nogales, Arizona, the same time
that the Arizona CattleGrower'.
will hold their meeting, on Feb.
14, 15 and 16. Extensive pre
parations are already being made
by the people of Nogales for
these meetings and it isexpected
the largest attendance of any
previous meeting will be had.
Many questions of vital import
ance to the cattle men will come
up at these meetings and it is
therefore important that every
eQW nfta in the country should
attend.,
Exploration of the Collosal
cave near Vail, east of Tucson,
has found evidence that the
cavern once was used as a rob
bers' roost, probably by train
bandits. Also found were ancient
Indian ceremonial altars and the
skeleton of an Indian, probably
that of a visitor who fell into a
crevice and thus lost his life.
No passage through the moun
tain was found, as had been re
ported by Indians, norwas there
found a stream said to exist.
The cave is immense in its
Spread 33!! 15 wandering have
been hardly more than entered.
Preparation for the big spring
drive goes on at high speed.
Men and airpla'nes, food and war
munitions are being rushed to
Europe and when the snow goes
off there will be something doing
all the time. Germany will know
that the United States is in the
war to stay until victory has
been achieved. The year 1918
ought to see the allied armies in
Berlin and that will be the result
if every man does his duty. The
farmers of America, the stock
man and those who raise flocks
or herds, or errow nroduce. will
do their nart. Others must. -Get

The readers of this paper will be
pleased to learn that there is at least
one dreaded disease that science has
been able to cure in all its- stages, and
that is catarrh. Catarrh being greatly
Influenced by constitutional conditions
requires constitutional treatment.
Hall's Catarrh Cure is taken internally
and acts thru the Elood on the Mucous
Surfaces of the System thereby de
stroying the foundation of the disease,
giving the patient strength by building
up the constitution and assisting na

they offer One Hundred Dollars for any
case that it fails lo cure. Send for list
