U. S. MEDICAL EFFICIENCY.
Mortality Only Eight Per Cent Among
Cur Wounded Soldiers.
Washington. D. C. Mortality
among American soldiers who
weie gassed was not nearly so
high as it is popularly believed
to have been. In fact, only 2
per cent of those seat to hospi
tals suffering from this form of
casualty succumbed, it is shown
by incomplete but accurate sta
tistics compiled by the War De
partment. Of the 74,573 cases
of gas poisoning treated in hos
pitals, 1194 were fatal.
The mortality in the grand
total of 231,172 cases of all
kinds treated in hospitals was
but 8 per cent. This low death
rate is considered a great trib
ute to the skill of the physians
and surgeons and to the effi
ciency of the army medical sys
tem as a whole.
Bayonets were more deadly
than bullets, these figures indi
cate. The total of those report
ed having been wounded by
bayonets was 181, of whom ten
died. That was six per cent.
The report covers 19,528 cases
of wounds by rifle bullets. Of
these 980, or 5 per cent, caused
death. The highest mortality
was due to airplane bombs. In
the partial statistics 141 casual
ties of this kind are included.
There were 36 deaths. Saber
wounds caused a mortality of 25
per cent in the total of 12 cases
listed.
Of the total of 222,252 men
admitted to hospitals for treat
ment for various wounds and
injuries as reported to June 1,
2919, 32,753 were victims of
shrapnel. Of these 2074, or 6
per cent, died of their wounds.
Hand granades were responsible
for the wounding of 870 men
and the death of 70. This was
but 7 per cent.
The total cases of men ad
mitted to hospitals for treat
ment of wounds inflicted by "the
enemy's military agencies," was
222,252. The total deaths were
13,866, or only 6 per cent. In
addition to these cases, there
were 8920 others described as
"casualties from external causes"
The highest mortality ascribed
to any particular - causation in
this group was 24 hours percent
in airplane accidents, but only
148 cases of this sort were in
cluded in the partial report.

No Assessment Work Required.
Every assessment pick stuck
in the air yesterday when it was
announced by an Associated
Press dispatch, that the resolu
tion suspending work on claims
this year was sent to President
Wilson. The resolution exempts
mine claimants in the United
States and Alaska from spend
ing at least $100 in labor or ma
terial on each claim located, but
not patented.
The previous resolution pass
ed by both houses, exempted on
ly five claims per person and
where two partners held indivi
dually more than five claims,
they could claim exemption on
only five jointly and be compell
ed to do the work on the re
mainder. Or, if they claimed
exemption on claims held indivi
dually, they must do the work
on the claims they held jointly.
In either case the joint resolu
tion did not quite cover the situ
ation. The new resolution, however,
covers all assessment work on
all claims and saves thousands
of hard earned dollars from go
ing into the pot holes over the
mining west. It has been re
gularly moved and seconded by
the perennial association of fri
jole eating desert rats, that when
the president signs the resolu
tion all members in good stand
ing pack into town for the win
ter and devote assessment money
and time in the search for likely
buyers of the particularly bo
nanza contribution to the world's
riches. Prospector.
ARIZONA NOTES.
Items of Interest Culled From Our
Exchanges.
Sixty different towns and post
offices in Arizona are represent
ed at the University this year.
Out of the 834 students enrolled,
615 are from Arizona towns.
The students coming from small
er places have, of course, receiv
ed their preparatory work in the
high schools of the state, some
in the normal schools and others
in the preparatory schools of
other states.
Now that the 8-R deal with
the Magma people is closed,
many questions are asked as to
when they will begin actual op
erations. The Magma people in
timated to Col. Richardson that
they would perhaps be busy on
the ground within ten days from
the time of passing papers,
which was last week. They will
open up first with the operation
of a diamond drill, and may con
tinue thus for several months.
Of course there's no use specu
lating as to the proportions of
their activities, as the Magma
long ago reached the point where
they do not play small games.

L. E. Barker has been ap
pointed highway engineer by the
Pima county highway commis
sion at a salary of $5000 per

county, and was associated with
Mr. Ryan for six years in road
work in the county. When Ryan
became highway engineer, Bar

gineer. He was put out by the
new board of supervisors at the
first of the year. Before coming
to Cochise county Mr. Barker
was engaged as locating engineer

now past and the decks cleared
for the next big event, Phoenix
is busying herself preparing for
the coming Arizona State Older
Boys Conference that convenes
there November 28 30, the three
days of the Thanksgiving vaca
tion. The numerous inquiries
that are coming into the con

Hornberger, Chairman, Charles
Donofrio, Dr. G.B. Couch, F. H.

ing made for every delegate to

service of the delegates, athletic
games, swimming, and other in
teresting forms of amusement
and recreation will be provided.
OUR SPECIAL EDITION.
(Douglas Daily International)
After a lapse, occasioned by
the war, the Daily International
is sending forth today its special
number entitled "1919 Greater
Progress Edition."
A vast amount of work, in
wtiting, editing and compiling,
has been accomplished by the
International in this production,
to say nothing of the task of
printing and publication. In this
number we have endeavored to
give a clear and truthful resume
of the resources and enterprises
of this city and county, and of
the state of Arizona, divested of
all coloring, and free from any
tinge of over enthusiasm.
In addition to supplying each
subscriber with a copy of this
issue, several thousand of extra
copies have been printed to meet
the extraordinary demands not
only of residents of this city and
section, but of public bodies de
siring to use them for promotion
purposes, and for the Use of ad
vertisers and others who wish to
spread the gospel of progress to
their correspondents all over the
country.
For those who wish to mail
them to friends outside of Ari
zona, the International has had
copies prepared for mailing,
wrapped and ready to address.
The more of these papers that
reach the hands of those not al
ready acquainted with the re
markable resources of Douglas,
of Cochise county, and of the
state in general, the greater will
be the benefits accomplished by
its publication. For this reason
the International does not hesi
tate to ask public spirited citi
zens everywhere throughout
southeast Arizona to send in
their mailing orders and have
them distributed liberally to
their friends in the old home
wherever they may be .
The edition is just seven times
larger than our regular daily
issue, and to meet the cost of
extra paper contained in it, the
selling price has been placed at
10 cents.
The cost of postage on the en
tire paper of seven sections, is
4 cents, making the total charge
on each copy mailed to friends
abroad, 14 cents.
As previously stated, the In
ternational will gladly address
and mail any desired number,
for anyone requesting it, at a
total charge of 14 cents per copy
The International has in the
past issued many similar edi
tions, but never before has it
bad the opportunity to cite so
many enterprises, or detail so
many evidences of progress at
home and in the country tribut
ary to Douglas, as are presented
in this number. As no special
edition was published last year
because of the war, there was a
wonderful accummulation of big,
progressive facts to chronicle,
all of which it is hoped, are
faithfully presented in this is
sue, making it the most remark
able document of its kind ever
presented to its readers by the
International.
It is the intention of this news
paper to prepare and publish
similar editions regularly each
year, depicting in photograph
and story, the great strides
taken by this city and the rap
idity developing country around
it, extending clear through to
the New Mexico line, and taking
in the entire progress of Cochise
county, Arizona in general, and
the state of Sonora in Mexico.
And those who have an ear to
the ground and read the signs
a right, predict that the issue of
October 31, 1920, will chronicle
a progress so great that the
present edition will seem tame
in comparison, gratifying though
it be to the International, and to
all who assisted in its prepara
tion, and to all loyal citizens of
Cochise county who rejoice in
these great proofs of progress.
Probably the record for a long
distance entry in the Arizona
state fair is attained this year
by Dutsie, a French Fox terrior,
brought here from Concepcion,
Chili, by her owner, George Mc
Masters, a South American im
pressario. The dog has travel
led approximately 28,000 miles
to enter the Arizona state fair. S3-

THE LEGION'S THANKS.
Reward Offered for Will Smith.
At a special meeting of the
city council of Nogales last Tues
day evening, a resolution was
passed offering a reward of $500
for the apprehension of W. H.
Smith, former city clerk and
treasurer, who is alleged to have
emblezzed about $16,000 city
funds. Notwithstanding the mys
terious actions" of Mr. Smith,
whose whereabouts are known
only to relatives and intimate
friends, many still believe in his
innocence. For many years Bill
Smith was one of Santa Cruz
county's most highly respected
honored citizens. His friends
say they will have to be shown
before they lose entire faith in
him. They say he'll make good
any shortage he owes Nogales.
Ridge Igo Post, American Le
gion, takes this method of giving
expression of thanks to all those
who so willingly and unselfishly
contributed to the Post's observ
ance of Armistice Day; and to
the public for the liberal patron
age extended.
The observance, on both even
ings, was a very satisfactory
success in every particular.
The Committee.
