The Spirit of Friendship.
This store looks upon its patrons not
merely as customers but as friends.
People purchase here because they
have friendly feeling for this store.
The cause which develops this friendly
feeling, may differ, in fact, they are
sure to differ. One's friendship for
the store is the result of finding good
values; another's is the result of effi
cient service and courteous treatment,
and so on.
Naturally this frieudshiply feeling on
the part of our patrons is reciprocated
on our part. And this spirit of mutual
friendship is an impetus for greater
service and an incentive to ever-increasing
endeavor to make this store
a place where every visitor will feel
perfectly at home.

stopped in Patagonia Monday

ports that the road bonds voted
on some time ago, are likely not

submitted for their purchase but
the premiums and other condi

clause requiring that they be
sold within the year, which is
close to the end. Patagonian.

Plenty of Work for Red Cross.
Surgeon General Rupert Blue
of the United States Public
Health Service sees plenty of
work ahead for the American
Red Cross despite the approach
of permanent peace. In this
connection he says:
"At no time since the Amer
ican Red Cross began minister
ing to a war stricken world has
there been more need for its ser
vices than at present. Providing
our soldiers and sailors with the
little comforts that cannot be
supplied by tho government, a
work which has always taken
precedence over every other Red
Cross activity, is as necessary
now as before hostilities ceased.
The American people are justly
proud of their Red Cross and
the way it has looked after the
comfort and assisted in protect
ing the health of the couutry's
fighting men. They will expect
the Red Cross to continue this
care without relaxation of effort
until the last man is back at his
own fireside. Furthermore, one
cannot think of the devastation
in Europe without the convic
tion that our Red Cross will
have to continue its relief opera
tions over there.

Mexicans and Americans, Mr.
Lawton fearlessly walked the
streets while scores of people
were being shot, and no doubt
prevented the loss of many lives,
when he finally succeeded in
persuading both sides to ceasa

sul and Mrs. Lawton will take
with them the best wishes of
many friends and acquaintances.

I
Washington, D. C. (Special.) Ac
cording to a report made to the United
States Public Health Service, the epi
demic of Influenza in Spain has al
ready caused an Increase in the preva
lence and dentlis from pulmonary tu
berculosis. A similar association be
tween influenza and tuberculosis was
I recently made by Sir Arthur Nowi
. holme, the chief inedicnl officer of the
I English public health service, in his
; analysis of the tuberculosis death rate
in Englund.
In order that the people of the Unit
ed States may profit by the experience
of other countries Surgeon General
Kupert Blue of the United States Pub
lic Health Service has Just issued a
warning emphasising the need of spe
cial precautions at the present time.
: "Experience seems to indicate, says
the Surgeon General, "that persons
; whose resistance has been weakened
; by an attack of influeuza are peculiar-
ttl In tll!w!f!lIoS!S. With
'J t
millions of its people recently alTected
wltli InflVmiza this country now of-
ifers conditions favoring the spread el
I tuberculosis."
One Million Consumptives in the
United States.
"Then you consider this a serious
jmenace?" was asked. "In my opinio
it is, though I hasteu to add it is dis
tinctly one against which the people
can guard. So far as one can estimate
there are at present ahout one million
eases of tuberculosis in the United
States. There- is unfortunately no
complete census available lo show ex
actly the number of tuberculous per
sons In each state despite (lie fact that
most of the status have wsils the dis
ease reportable. In New York city,
where reporting htts been in force for
many years, over 35,000 cases of tu
berculosis are registered with the De
partment of Ileaith. Those familiar
with the situation believe that the ad
dition of unrecognized and unreported
cases would make the number nearer
50,000. The very careful health sur
vey conducted during the past two
years in Kraminghaiu. Mass., revealed
200 cases of tuberculosis in a popula
tion of approximately 15,000. If these
proportions hold true for the United
States as a whole they would indicate
that about one In every hundred per
sons Is tuberculous. Kach of these
-constitutes a source of danger to be
guarded against.1'
What to De.
fti his statement te the public Sur
geon General Blue points out how
those who have had influenza should
protect themselves against tuberculo
sis. "AH who have recovered from In
fluenza," says the Surgeon General,
"should have their lungs carefully ex
amined by a competent physician. In
tact. It Is desirable to have several ex
aminations made a month apart. Such
examinations cannot be made through
tfie clothing nor can they be carried
out In two or three minutes. If the
lungs are found to be free from tuber
culosis every effort should be made to
keep them so. This can be done by

Danger Signs.
The SurgeoB General warned espe
cially against certain danger signs,
such as "decline" and "colds which
hang on."
These, he explained, were often the
beginning of tuberculosis. "If you do
not get well promptly, if your cold
seems to hang on or your health and
strength decline, remember Uiat these
are often the eurly signs of tuberculo
sis. Pluce yourself at once under the
care of a competent physician. Tuber
culosis is curable iu the early stages.
Patent Medieines Dangerous in Tuber
culosis. "Above all do not trust in (he mis
leading stateiuents of unscrupulous
patent medicine fakers. There Is no
specific medicine for the euro of tuber
culosis. The money spent on such
medicines is throwu away ; it should
be spent Instead for good food and de
tent living."

STOMACH TROUBLE
Mr. Marion Kolcomb, of Nancy, Ky., says: "For quite
a long while I suffered with stomach trouble. I would
have pains and a heavy feeling after my meals, a most
disagreeable taste in my mouth. If I ate anything with
butter, oi! or grease, I would spit it up. I began to have
regular sick headache. I had used pills and tablets, but
after a course of these, I would be constipated. It just
seemed to tear my stomach all up. I found they were
no good at all fcr my trouble. I heard
THEDFORD'S
recommended very highly, so began to use it It cured
me. I keep it in the house all the time. It is the best
liver medicine made. I do not have sick headache or
stomach trouble any more." Black-Draught acts on
the jaded liver and helps it to do its important work of
throwing oul: waste materials and poisons from the sys
tem. This medicine should be in every household for
use in time of need. Get a package today. If you feel
sluggish, take a dose tonight You will feel fresh to
morrow. Price 25c a package. All druggists.
