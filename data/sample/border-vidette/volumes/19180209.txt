From a letter received from
National Headquarters in New
York City, the Arizona Anti-
Tuberculosis Association is in
formed that it will probably lead
the United States in the per
capita sale of seals this year.
If this proves to be true," it
means that Arizona will be pre
sented with a pennant stating
the amount of the sale and that
it is the pennant winner. The
sale has already surpassed the
aim set by the Association to
sell a million seals. This triples
the sale of last year and exceeds
the total amount previously sold
in this state.
Possibility of a reversal of de
cision under which hundreds of

county this week before the su
preme court, when L. B. Whit

advanced the theory, that an
officer who accepts compensation
under a statute and treats such

of back salaries of county offi

OUR WAR AIMS.
"What we demand in this war,
therefore, is nothing peculiar to
ourselves. It is that the world
be made fit and safe to live in;
and particularly that it be made
safe for every peace loving na
tion which, like our own, wishes
to live its own life, determine its
own institutions, oe assurea oi
justice and fair dealing by the
other peoples of the world as
against force and selfish aggres
sion. All the peoples of the
world are in effect partners in
this interest, and for our own
part we see very clearly that
unless justice be done to others
it will not be done to us. The
program of the world's peace,
therefore, is our program."

IOO PER CENT EFFICIENCY.
Recently a representative of
the department of the interior
who was in Phoenix to inspect
the federal land office, said: "Of
the sixty-seven land offices in
the United States, the one here
in Phoenix is in the lead in effi
ciency. There are other offices
that employ a larger, force but
not one that exceeds this in the
volume of work handled in pro
portion to the office force em
ployed." This is quite a compli
ment. Climate conditions here
are favorable to efficient work,
besides our people in every line
are doing their best to conserve,
hence there is full hundred per

States land office here in Phoe

'A MINERAL KINGDOM."
Mining Activity in Mexico Returning to
Normal Conditions.
In the first interview given to
the press since his arrival in
New York about two weeks ago
to assume the duties of Consul
General of Mexico, Senor Adolfo
de la Huerta on Saturday gave
to a representative of the Indus
trial and Mining Age his views
on the revival of mining in Mex
ico, says the Industrial and Min
ing Age. The Consul considers
the mining outlook in the south
ern Republic as brighter than
ever before. He is particularly
enthusiastic as to the silver
mines of Mexico, the total pro
duction of which approximates
$4,500,000,000. He pointed out
the intensity with which mining
all over the Republic has devel
oped, calling attention to the
splendid fashion in which the
mines in the states of Hidalgo,
Mexico, Zacatecas and Guana
juato have entered an era of
great prosperity.
Before leaving Mexico for New
York, Senor de la Huerta stop
ped over in Sonora, his native
State, where he remained sev
eral weeks. He served for over
a year as the Civil Governor of
Sonora, being succeeded only
about five monts ago by the pre
sent incumbent, General Plutar
co Elias Calles. The splendid
record he made in the adminis
tration of the affairs of that
State, as well as the remarkable
role he played in the revolution
ary movement headed by Senor
Venustiano Carranza and in the
Department of the Interior, where
he served for more than a year
under the Constitutional Govern
ment, eminently tit him for his
work as Consul General. It is
certain, therefore, that his ad
ministration of the office will
bring about a better understand
ing between his country and the
United States.
Senor de la Huerta is a young
man of progressive ideas and
has an attractive and forceful
personality. He is the proud
possessor of a large gold medal
presented to him by the Mayo
Indians as evidence of their es
teem and in recognition of the
just manner in which he con
ducted affairs affecting their land
interests.
Questioned as to mining con
ditions in the southern Republic,
particularly in the State of Son
ora, Senor de la Huerta said:
"It is a source of great satis
faction "to me to be able to say
that mining activity in Mexico is
rapidly returning to normal con
ditions and that the outlook for
the industry is very bright. As
all those who have investigated
are aware, Mexico is a great
treasure-house of minerals. It
has other vast resources, of
course, but on account of its
great production of the precious
metals, it is best Known as a
mining country. While the de
velopment of all resources is
making good headway, mining
is leading in the rehabilitation of
the nation, and the future output
of silver to say nothing of other
metals, will make the production
of the past, great as it has been,
appear comparatively insignifi
cant.
"Throughout the Republic
mining companies which have
been operating on a reduced
scale are returning to normal
conditions, and companies whose
properties have been idle for
several years have resumed or
are preparing to resume opera
tions. The mine operators of
Mexico, native and foreign, are
keenly alive to the opportunity
afforded by the stellar position
silver has attained and can be
depended upon to exert their
utmost efforts to place the na
tion once more in the lead as a
producer of silver in the short
est possible time.
"Sonora is in itself a mineral
kingdom. Notwithstanding its
great output of silver, copper,
and gold in the past, the State
has hardly been 'scratched' and
it has yet to gain its greatest
fame as a producer of these me
tals. Sonora is leading all other
States in mining operations and
the future for the industry there
is very bright. I am certain that
there will be a continuance of
this improvement and that Son
ora in the future will be a great
er factor in contributing to the
yield of silver and other metals
by the nation as a whole than in
the past.
"At the great camp of Can
anea the Greene Cananea resum
ed operations early in December
and it is rapidly returning to
normal production. The Mocte
zuma Copper Company, controll
ed by the Phelps Dodge inter
ests, is working its mines at Na
cozari with a full force of miners
and is steadily increasing opera
tions at its Promontorio mines,
near Lampazos, in the Moctezu
ma district. The El Tigre silver
gold mine, also in the Moctezu
ma district, is adding handsome
ly to its already great produc
tion. The Las Chispas mine,
near Arizpe, is also rapidly re
turning to normal. The same is
true of many other mines. It
can be further stated that most
of the companies that have not
already resumed operations are
getting ready to do so, and many
new companies are preparing to
enter the field. Therefore, I feel
that I am justified in saying that
the mining outlook is now more
promising than ever before."
2,000 Men Experienced in Handling
Horses Wanted.
For work in the enlisted Vet
erinary Uorps, z.UUO men not
subject to call under the select
ive service law are wanted. They
will be assigned to duty in vet
erinary hospitals and for other
purposes in the corps. Service
overseas can be expected shortly.
There is particular demand for
veterinary and agricultural stu
dents, farmers, stablemen, and
others accustomed to handling
horses. A few men of the fol
lowing occupations will also be
accepted: Horseshoers, saddlers,
pharmacists, cooks, typist, and
stenographers.
Pay for enlisted men and non
commissioned officers range from
$30 to $56 a month, food, cloth
ing, and quarters. Applications
for enlistmen can be made at
any Army recruiting office.
Compulsory Military Training.
Many of the people of the Un
ited States are opposed to mili
tary training in the schools, and
especially is this the case among
certain elements of the trade
unions and pacificts. They claim
that military training in the
schools, or military training in
any form would eventually .re
sult in the Prussianizing of Am
erica. Just how this system of
"Prussianizing" would result
from this class of tcaining is not
quite apparent to the ordinary
individual. In fact such train
ing would only be a form of
athletics practiced by many of
the schools of the country to
day. It would result in the de
velopment of boys that under
the old system were allowed to
go through life poor wrecks of
men. Look at the young fellows
after a few months of military
training and you will agree that
it sets them up and brings out
all that is best in them. Their
figures are straightened and
their stride becomes quick and
their whole being is given an
alertness that they could not
have acquhed in any other way.
Leffevery school in the United
States have military training for
ten years and the youth of the
land will become 100 per cent
more efficient. Miner.
To Adopt Bertillon System.
The Bertillon figerprint sys
tem will be used by the Yuma
police department. This was the
announcement made yesterday
by Chief of Police Levy. After
giving the matter a great deal
of study and getting the advice
of experts, the head of the local
force has concluded that the
fingerprint system is the only
infallible way to detect criminals.
The fingerprint outfit will come
from Los Angeles. A fingerprint
expert was here recently and
gave Chief Levy many valuable
hints.
As soon as the system is in
stalled all members of the force
will be given instructions in the
use of the system. Sun. E. 0. MILLER. Editor and Prop.

INCOME TAX RETURNS.
Special Agent ot Internal Revenue Here
to Give Valuable Pointers.
Mr. G. N. Dernier, the special
agent of the Internal Re
venue Bureau, is here from
Phoenix, having his headquart
ers at the Town Hall'. He is
here for the purpose of assisting
people in making their income
tax returns, and will gladly aid
you in every possible way. Since
coming here Mr. Dernier, who
is a. deputy internal revenue col
lector, has been a very busy
man.
If you have not filed your in
come tax-returns, better do so
at pace, while the deputy in
ternal revenue inspector is here
It may save you a deal of trouble
and expense later.
The first thing to be under
stood is that the income tax ap
plies only to your income for tbe
calendar year 191 1. Your in
come for prior years and your
estimated income for 1918 are
not to be considered.
The war revenue act of Octo
ber 3, 1917, provides for a nor
mal rate of tax of 2 per cent on
net incomes of unmarried per
sons in excess of $1000 and upon
incomes of married persons or
heads of families in excess of
$2000.
If you are unmarried and your
income for 1917 was $1000 or
more you must get a tax blank,
fill it out and file it with the col
lector of internal revenue in the
district in which you live. If
married and your net income
was $2000 or more, you must file
a return with tbe collector. Re
turns must be in tbe hands' of
collectors not later than March
1, 1918.
A taxpayer is considered to be
the head of a family and entitled
to all tbe exemptions allowed a
married person if he is actually
supporting one or more persons
closely connected with him by
blood relationship, relationship
by marriage or by adoption.
Women as well as men must
pay an income tax. The com
bined net income of a married
couple in excess of $2000 is as
sessed. They may file a joint
return or each file a separate re
turn if desired. If a joint return
is filed either one may claim the
exemption or it may be divided
between them. A widow, a wo
man living apart from her hus
band, or a maid is assessed on
her net income above $1000.
' Net income" means gross in
come less certain deductions pro
vided for by the act. Expenses
actually incurred in carrying on
any business may be deducted,
but not family nor living ex
penses. In making out your return you
may deduct the following from
gross income:
Interest paid on mortgages
and notes and other indebted
ness, except indebtedness for
the purchase of tax exemption
securities.
Rent paid for offices or busi
ness places.
Taxes paid, except for local
improvement such as sewer and
water, in come taxes and excess
profits taxes.
Losses sustained in business
or trade arising from fires; storm
or other casualty or by theft; if
not compensated for by insur
ance or otherwise. If property
was purchased prior to March 1,
1913, the fair market price or
value on March 1, 1913, is the
basis for figuring the loss.
Losses sustained in specula
tions and side lines not connect
ed with ycur regular business,
but these deductions must not
exceed the profits from similar
transactions.
Debts ascertained to be worth
less and charged off within the
year.
Reasonable depreciation for
business structures but not for
your residence.
Depreciation for oil, gas wells,
mines, etc.
You must include under gross
income the following items:
Salaries, wages and commis
sions or compensation of what
ever kind for personal -services.
All profits derived from busi
ness, trade or commerce.
Profits from tbe sale of prop
erty, real or personal.
Interest on notes, bonds and
bank deposits, including savings
banks.
Incomes received from fiducia
ries, that is amounts received
from incomes of estates, trusts,
etc., through trustees, adminis
trators or executors.
Dividends on stock, whether
received as cash or stock. Only
dividends paid out of earnings
or profits accrued since March
1, 1913, are taxable.
Net partnership profits, whe
ther divided and distributed or
not.
Royalties from mines, oil and
gas wells, patents, copyrights
and franchises.
A PROCLAMATION
EXECUTIVE DEPARTMENT, STATE
OP ARIZONA.
Iu this, the sixth year of Ari
zona's Statehood, and the first
year of our country's participa
tiou in the war that has nearly
all Europe in its grip, it is in
every way fitting that February
14th, 1918, declared by the law
of this State a legal holiday un
der the name of admission day,
be observed also as thrift day
and made an occasion for a spe
cial effort on the part of every
Arizonan to support the National
Government in its financing of
the huge war organization that
is essential to the dethroning of
autocracy in Europe and the
safeguarding of our Nation and
the civilized world against the
tryanny of Prussianism.
Our country's success in the
present war, that Democracy
may survive to comfort and
gladden posterity, does not de
pend on armies alone, but on
the effective mobilization of our
resources.
To win the war is not only the
Government's problem, but also
that of every loyal citizen. Unity
and collective effort will bring
success. Personal self-denial,
plus personal patriotic effort by
every American, will make us a
nation invincible.
The keynote of our solemn
duty is Thrift. Thrift means
something sacrificed, something
saved, and thus freely given to
meet the country s need. It re
quires only a little effort by the
individual, but if universally
practiced, it will insure our ar
mies of that support which will
bring them victory.
Now, therefore, in the present
crisis, l, tjeo. W. f. Hunt, (gov
ernor of Arizona, by virtue of
the trust reposed in me by the
people of this State, do earnest
ly recommended that giving to
the Government through indivi
dual saving and investment in
Government securities be made
to characterize predominantly
the observance of admission
day, February 14th, 1918, the
sixth anniversary of Arizona's
entrance to the union.
I do. furthermore, urge that
admission day, as hereinbefore
designated, be celebrated by
fraternal orders, civic organiza
tions, public and parochial
schools, and by individual citi
zens in the manner above out
lined, to the end that all tbe
people of the State may aid in
making possible the country s
triumph in the present war
through the inculcation and ex
ercise of Thrift, and through
specific investments in War Sav
ings securities, as recommended
by the Federal Director of Wai
Savings for Arizona.
In Witness Whereof, I have
hereunto set my hand and caus
ed the Great Seal of the State of
Arizona to be affixed.
Done at Phoenix, the capital.
this 5th day of February, A. D.,
1918.

Governor of Arizona.

The cause which develops this friendly

Naturally this friendshiply feeling on

on our part. And this spirit of mutual

In a recent communication to
Secretary of War Baker, the
commander of the American Ex
peditionary Forces said:
"There has never been a sim
ilar body of men to lead as clean
lives as our' American soldiers
in Prance. They have entered
this war with the highest devo
tion to duty and with no other
idea than to perform these duties
in most efficient manner possi
ble. They fully realize their
obligation to their own people,
their friends, and the country.
A rigid program of instruction
is carried cut daily with tradi
tional American enthusiasm.
Engaged in healthy, interesting
exercises in the open air, with
simple diets, officers and men,
like trained athletes, are ready
for their tasks. Forbidden the
use of stronjr drink and protect
ed by stringent regulations
against sexual evils, and sup
-ported by their own moral cour
age, their good behavior is the
subject of most favorable com
ments, especially by our allies.
American mothers may rest as
8ured that their sons are a credit
to them and to the Nation, and
they may well look forward to
the proud day wnen on the bat
tle field these splendid men will
shed a new luster on American
manhood."
