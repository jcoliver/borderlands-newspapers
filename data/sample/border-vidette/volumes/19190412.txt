COURTESY.
The Spirit of Friendship.
This store looks upon its patrons not
merely as customers but as friends.
People purchase here because they
have friendly feeling for this store.
The cauae which develops this friendly
feeling, may differ, in fact, they are
sure to differ. One's friendship for
the store is the result of finding good
values; another's is the result of effi
cient service and courteous treatment,
and so on.
Naturally this friendshiply feeling on
the part of our patrons is reciprocated
on our part. And this spirit of mutual
friendship is an impetus for greater
service and an incentive to ever-increasing
endeavor to make this store
a place where every visitor will feel
perfectly at home.

CAN BE DEDUCTED.
Expenses incurred in advertis- j
ing and promoting the sale of
Liberty Bonds and War Savings
Stamps are deductable on the
part of individuals and corpora
tions as a business expense in
the computation of income taxes,
according to advice given out by
Commissioner Roper, of the In
cernal Revenue Department at
Washington. It is the intention
of the government to show every
consideration to those men and
women who have given their
time and means in previous loans
and to whom it looks for assist
ance in putting across the final
effort of the Victory Liberty
Loan.
It further explains the effort
on the part of the government
to show its appreciation for the
work of patriotic Americans, as
evidenced in the announcement
that medals struck from captur
ed German cannons are to be
awarded all of the workers in
the Victory Liberty Loan cam
paign, which will open on April
21st. The medal will bear on
its front an embossed design of
the Treasury Building at Wash
ington. The reverse side will
bear an inscription giving the
history of the emblem, with
space for the name of the win
ner of the medal.
DEFINITION IS CORRECT.
A correspondent sends in the
following communication:
I see you use the words"Boos
ter" and "Knocker" very often
in the paper. Are these the
definitions? This is what I
think you mean:
When the Creator had made
all the good and beautiful things,
in order that they might be
truly appreciated, He then made
the beasts, reptiles and' poison
ous insects. When He had fin
ished, He had left over scraps
that were too bad to put in the
rattlesnake, the hyena, the scor
pion or the skunk. So He
placed all these together, cover
ed it with Suspicion, wrapped it
with a Yellow Streak and called
it a "Knocker !"
Then, as a compensation for
this fearful product, He took a
sunbeam and put into it the
heart of a child, the love of a
mother, the brain of a man,
wrapped these in Civic Pride,
covered with Brotherly Love,
gave it a mark of Velvet and a
grasp of Steel and called it a
"Booster." He made him a
lover of fields and flowers and
manly sports; a believer in
Equality and Justice. .And ever
since these two were created,
mortal man has had the privilege
of choosing his associations.
These are the definitions, as I
understand them.

air Service needs men.
Golden Opportunity to the Young Men
Seeking Advancement in !ife.
Enlistment in the Air Service
of the Army opens up a wealth
of opportunities to the energetic,
active young man. It enables
him to wear the uniform of his
country the most honorable in j
the world while completing In.
education and becoming- an ex
pert tradesman, an.fi at the same
time affording him the advant
ages of travel.
It is possible at this lime for
men who are now in the army to
take their discharge, receive the
$60, that is allowed each dis
charged man, re enlist in the
Air Service for one year, then
be given one month's furlough,
and in most cases it will be pos
sible for that man to retain the
non-commissioned grade that he
has attained, and upon re enlist
ment, be allowed five cents per
mile to his home. Inasmuch as
he can obtain a one cent a mile
rate when going on a furlough
and return to proper station, he
can save from this amount a cer
tain nominal sum. For men who
have had service in the army,
it is believed that there is a de
cided advantage of the one year
enlistment, or until labor condi
tions have become more stable,
at which time, they can expect
more positive market for their
service in civilian life.
To the civilian who has not
been in the service, or who has
been in another branch of the
service, the three yeax enlist
ment holds most promising pros
pects. The Air Service has a
mechanical instruction school in
operation and is about to create
two or three others. The Air
Service Mechanics Schools en
ables the young apprentice to
complete his education and be
come an expert tradesman, qual
ifying him for large earnings.
The advantages of learning a
trade in a government school of
mechanical instruction over a
man's learning that trade ly en
tering a machine shop as an ap
prentice are incomparable. In
the first place he is sent to a
mechanical instruction school
where he is taught the principles
of his trade and applies these
principles to practical, work
which is given him at the same
time. The government pays him
his salary all the time he is
learning. During this time no
pay is deducted for sickness, he
has the privilege of furlough and
pass and his livelihood is a cer
tainty. Another point to be con
sidered is the question of retire
ment after thirty years' service.
After thirty years service, an
enlisted man is retired on three
quarters of the pay he is receiv
ing at the time his thirty years
are completed, and in addition
he is given allowances for heat,
light, etc.
The chances of advancement
in the Air Service are excellent.
A good, bright, energetic and
active young man with initiative
and force, should not remain a
private long, for which such
qualifications a man should soon
be promoted to grade of non
commissioned officer. The fol
lowing are the rates of pay in
the Army:
Private, 30; private, first
class, $33;, corporal, 35; ser
geant, $44; sergeant, aviation
mechanician, $66; sergeant, first
class, $51; sergeant, lirst-class,
aviation mechanician, $73.50;
master signal electrician, $81;
master signal electrician, avia
tion mechanician, $121.50.
In connection with this pay it
must be borne in mind that the
man receives in addition to
steady employment with short
hours and no "lay offs," free
clothing, free medical attention,
free hospital treatment, free
dental attention, free education,
free room and board, leave of
absence with pay, no loss of pay
while sick, life insurance at
moderate rate, free amusements
and excellent chances to travel.
The Air Service offers excellent
opportunity to men between the
ages 21 and 35 who have me
chanical inclination.
The desires of a man for al
most any type of work can be
fulfilled by an enlistment in the
Air Service. The following types
of tradesmen are required, and
men will be trained for these
duties: Radio mechanical work,
wireless telegraph and tele
phone, radio electricians, air
ptane mechanics, aero motor me
chanics, propeller makers, fabric
workers, magneto repair men,
instrument repair men, carpen
ters and cabinet makers, ma
chinists and tool makers, metal
workers and welders, copper
smiths and vulcanizers, photo
graphers, d raf tmen, bench me
chanics, chauffers. The main
qualifications to determine whe
ther or not an enlisted man will
be taught how to Hy are phy
sical qualitications combined
with necessary mechanical know
ledge to participate in flights.
After a man learns to By, he
will, if properly qualified from
an educational viewpoint, be
given a good opportunity to re
ceive commission in the Air Service.

At the recessed session of the
Nogales Town Council last Thurs
day evening, the following re
solution of respect to the me
mory, of the late Councilman
George W. Dunbar, was adopted:
Whereas, the Common Council
of Nogales, Arizona, has lost
one of its honored members by
the untimely death of George
W. Dunbar, be it
Resolved, That we sincerely
mourn his loss and we hereby
tender our condolence to the
bereaved family he left behind
to grieve for him. Mr. Dunbar
was one of our most progressive
citizens, always working for the
advancement of this community
in every way and alive to its
every need.
He was a builder, oie with
foresight to see the needs of the
future and to construct for it.
In a material sense he expressed
this constructive .spirit by open
ing new sub divisions of the
town of Nogales, and building
homes for its citizens to make of
Nogales a better city. In a spir
itual sense he was equally con
structive, and was always build
ing up that spirit of co operation
and unity among the citizens of
Nogales that would lead to a
public spirit which would make
of Nogales a better place in
which to live.
As a member of the Council
Mr. Dunfcfkr was conscientious
and weighed every proposition
advanced with a single regard
as to its effect upon the future
of Nogales. He was extremely
careful that his official acts
should not be tinged with selfish
interestes or motives, and this
scrupulousness coupled, with the
ability he had so often demon
strated in private business made
him a most valuable member of
the council, and we feel we have
suffered a distinct loss in his ab
sence from our deliberations,
smile and his s'pirit of optimism
on the streets of Nogales, and
to us the world seems darkened
on account of. his absence from
our midst.
Realizing that the same qual
ities which we, his business
friends and associates shall re
member with sorrow now that
he is no longer with us, must
have endeared him to his family
and relatives in a much greater
degree, and that their grief and
sorrow over his sudden death
must be overwhelming, we take
this method of expressing our
sympathy and extending our
condolences to them.
Be it further resolved, that
this resolution be spread upon
the minutes of this body as a
tribute to the memory of George
W. Dunbar, and that a copy
thereof, be forwarded by the
To wn Clerk to his bereaved fami
ly as a token of our sympathy.
This week Nogales was visit
ed by Mr. John W. Bogan, of
Tucson, who with his family re
sided in Nogales many years
ago, and his son Stewart, now
with the American army in.
Prance, was born here. Mr.
Bogan owns valuable cattle and
mining interests in the Oro Blan
co district, this county, and in
the Arivaca region. The gen
tleman is pleasantly remember
ed by all old. time residents of No
gales, and during his visit here
met many of them.

treat to the music lovers of this

presented with a total of forty
j five artists appearing during the
seven days. The big musical
feature, of course, will be the
coming of the Czecho-Slovak
Band under the direction of
Jarosfav Cimera. This organ
ization composed of musicians
from the plucky little land of
Bohemia has been winning mu
sical commendation in the East
and .their coming will be eagerly
anticipated by band music en
thnsiasts. Madame Helen Cafa
reliy, a Chicago opera singer
will appear as soloist in the
evening, singing a group of Bo
hemian foik songs. '
Another musical feature of
particular prominence is the ap
pearance of Mary Adel Hays,
noted New York colorature so
prano, supported by her com
pany of Recital Artists. Miss
Hays has one of the big color
atura voices of the country.
Other m'usical eventsof the week

world.
The lecture staff this year
looks particularly strong. The
war story is to be told by the
famous little Canadian Private
Peat, whose name is almost a
household word throughout the
country. Humorously and dram
atically he tells of "Two Years
in Hell and Back With a Smile."
Edward F. Treftz, formerly
assistant to Herbert Hoover and
Field Secretary of the U. S.
Chamber of Commerce, is one of
the leading lecturers of the pro
gram, his message on Recon
struction problems is big and
vital and of tremendous import
ance at this time. Another lec
turer of national standing is '
Adam Bede, formerly Congress
man from, Minnesota. He is a
man eminently fitted to discuss
present day issues in a sane
constructive manner. Other lec
turers are W. L. Mellinger,
bringing new light on the Mex
ican question; A. D. Carpenter
with a popular lecture on astro
nomy, Miss R. Louise Fitch and
Mrs. R. C. McCredie, discussing
the outlook for womankind in
the days ahead; Dr. Elliott A.
Boyl, with an inspirational lec
ture; Joseph Clare, "The Pastor
of Petrograd," with a great
story of the Russian Revolution,
and Henry Warren Poor with an
illustrated lecture on the closing
days of the war and present con
ditions overseas.
Straight entertainment will be
provided by Elsie Mae Gordon,
one of the most talented readers
and entertainers of the platform.
Edwin M. Whitney, of Boston,
comes with entertainment of an
unusual kind and quality. He
possesses sole rights from the
authors of "Turn to the Right"
i to present that big metropolitan
success in monologue form. Ed
win Whitney is probably better
known than any other dramatic
interpreter in the country and
his appearance on the third
night will be one of the big feat
ures of the weak.

The readers of this paper will lie
pleased to learn that there is at least
one dreaded disease that science has
been able to cure in all its stages, and
that is catarrh. Catarrh being greatly
influenced by constitutional conditions
requires constitutional treatment.
Hall's Catarrh Curo is taken internally
and acts thru the Blood on the Mucous
Surfaces of the System thereby de
stroying the foundation of the disease,
giving the patient strength by building
up the constitution and assisting na
ture in doing its worfc. The proprie
tors have so much faith in the curative
powers of Hull's Catarrh Cure that
they offer One Hundred Dollars for any
case that it fails to cure. Send for list
of testimonials.
