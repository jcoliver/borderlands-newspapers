Restoration to the public do
main from the Mohzano national
forest of 96,500 acres of land in
central and western New Mexico
and 27,700 acres in northern Ari
zona was announced recently by
Secretary Lane. The lands, gen
erally of grazing character, will
be subject to homestead entry at
and after 9 a. m.. February 11,
next, and to settlementand other
forms of disposition on and after
February 18.
American cattlemen operating
in Mexico have started a move
ment to organize an association
to prevent stolen cattle and
hides being brought into the
United States in bond and sold.
The plan is to have the sheriff
search the cars containing cattle
and hides for anything stolen
from the ranches owned by the
American ranchers in Mexico.
An inspector will also be em
ployed if the plan i carried out.
A gratifying condition is noted
in Arizona live stock industry,
notwithstanding the demands of
the war. In the past year range
cattle, on the tax rolls, have in
creased 136,174; sheep, 86,131,
horses 16C0, and mules 1332. It
had been expected that the pre
vailing high prices would have
served to deplete ranges, but
this does not appear to have
been the result. These figures
do not include the receipts of
cattle from the plains region,
shipped here on account of the
drouth. Cattleman.
Dean A. E. Douglas, astro
nomer at the University of Ari
zona, reports that the work on
the manufacturing of the neces
sary mechanical equipment for
the new $60,000 reflecting tele
scope for the University of Ari
zona, which was recently donat
ed to the University, has been
held up indefinitely. This is due
to the fact that the only plant in
the country which makes this
equipment is now engaged en
tirely in war works, principally
the manufacturing of gunsights,
and has been prohibited by the
government from doing any
private work until present mat
ters are cleared.
Two thirds of the stock of
eggs in cold storage in Arizona
must be disposed of by January
1, 1918, according to an order
which has been received by
Timothy A. Riordan, United
States food administrator for
Arizona, from W. F. Priebe, in
charge of the poultry and egg
section of the perishable foods
division. In a letter to the com
mission men Mr. Priebe indi
cates that there are altogether
too many eggs in cold storage at
this time, and asks their co oper
ation and that of their patrons
in securing large withdrawals
before the first of the year. The
tendency of such withdrawals,
it was pointed out, would be to
reduce the cost of eggs to the
consumer.
LANE GRANTS PERMITS.
Secretary Lane has issued re
gulations under which permits
may be obtained to prospect for
potash on public lands. For
some years all lands known to
contain potash have been with
drawn from public acquisition,
but the cutting off of potash
from Germany makes it neces
sary to develop this country's
supply of the valuable mineral.
Permits may be issued to citi
zens, associations and corpora
tions of the United States for
the exploration of not exceeding
2,560 acres each of land in com
pact form, the permits to be for
a period of two years. If potash
is discovered in commercial
quantities and quality, the per
mittee will be entitled to a pat
ent for one-fourth of the area
covered by his permit, the re
mainder to be subject to lease
by the government.

ARIVACA GETS BULLS.
R. L. Tankersley, the well
known cattle dealer, brought in
a car load of pure bred Hereford
yearling bulls this week from
Missouri, that he sold to the
Arivaca Land & Cattle company.
These are the best average ship
ment of Hereford bulls seen in
this part of the country. They
are big bone, good conformation,
and splendid mark.
Besides they come from the
best strain of Herefords in the
east and are different from any
bulls now on the Arivaca range.
President of the company, J. W.
Bogan, liked the bulls so well
when they arrived that he had
Mr. Tankersley wire at once for
another car load of the same
stock. These bulls will be taken
at once to the Arivaca ranch and
placed in pasture, where they
will be fed through the winter
on cake and forage feed. The
object of this company in bring
ing in their bulls at this time of
the year is to get them thorough
ly acclimated by spring, when
they will be ready for service.

NEW REVENUE WAR STAMPS.
The act of Congress of Octo
ber 3rd, 1917, to provide revenue
to defray war expenses requires
that adhesive war tax stamps
shall be kept on sale by post
masters: These stamps are not
good for postage, but are to be
used solely to pay the war re
venue taxes upon parcel post
packages on which the postage
is 25 cents or more, and upon
promissory notes, conveyances,
and other business and legal
documents as set forth in the
law.
As this law affects the parcel
post:
On and after December 1st,
1917, there shall be levied, col
lected and paid upon every par
cel of package transported from
one point to another in the Unit
ed States on which the postage
amounts to 25 cents or more, a
tax of one cent for each 25 cents
or fractional part thereof charg
ed for such transportation, to be
paid by the consignor. No such
parcel or package shall be trans
ported until a -stamp or stamps
representing the tax due shall
have been affixed thereto.
According to a law passed by
the recent congress all instru
ments for record must bear re
venue stamps in accordance with
the following schedule.
Surety and indemnity bonds,
fifty cents.
Conveyances: Deeds wherein
any real estate is transferred,
fifty cents for $100 to $500 in
valuation and fifty cents addi
tional for each $500 or fraction
thereof. This is exclusive of
any incumbrance on the prop
erty. By this is meant actual
and not the expressed valuation
in the conveyance.
Powers of attorney, twenty
five cents.
The law states that "Whoever
makes, signs, issues, or accepts,
or causes to be made, signed,
issued or accepted, any instru
ment, document, or paper of any
"kind of description whatsoever
without the full amount of tax
thereon being duly paid, is guil
ty of a misdemeanor and upon
conviction thereof shall pay a
fine of not more than $100.00 for
each offense."
YUMA COUNTY MAKES RECORD
One of the best agricultural
showings of the state is made by
Yuma county on the tabulations
of the Council of Defense. Most
of the county's agriculture is
very near the county seat and is
directly benefitted by the La
guna dam irrigation system, a
system capable of large exten
sion upon an immense acreage
south of Yuma and north of the
international line. Crops on thB
Colorado Indian reservation,
around Parker in the northern
part of the county, aggregated
2,590 acres, with 1,140 acres in
milo maize, 500 in cotton, 500 in
alfalfa, 100 in each of corn,
wheat, pasture crops and pink
beans and 50 acres in tepary
beans, all indicating that a con
siderable labor reserve has been
found among the Mohave In
dians. Outside the irrigation
project, there is a gross crop of
4,197 acres, of which 2,294 acres
are in alfalfa and 1,012 in cotton
The gross crop acreage of the
county was 35,234.
Make This A Liberty Bond Christmas
Urging upon the banks of Ari
zona the necessity of continuing
the work of distributing Liberty
bonds among as many investors
as possible, and placing these
securities in the bands of per
sons who will hold them through
the war, Governor Campbell has
addressed the following letter to
the various banks of Arizona:
December 1, 1917.
My Dear Sirs I am reminded
by the governor of the Federal
Reserve bank of the twelfth dis
trict that a continued effort up
on the part of our bankers for
the widest possible distribution
of Liberty Loan 4 per cent bonds
is necessaiy.
Our government requires every
dollar of new money available
for the purchase of its bonds
during the war, aifti the real
purpose of the Liberty .Loan
campaigns is a distribution of
these government bonds among
investors who will hold them
during the period of the war.
Officers and employes of all
banks are urged to constant ef
fort in the distribution of any
bonds they have an hand among
residents of their districts who
have not already invested.'
It is pointed out that the ap
proaching holiday season may
well furnish an incentive to the
purchase of these bonds. Every
effort must be made by letter,
advertisement and personally to
prevail on our people to buy
these bonds as Christmas gifts
to relatives and friends, instead
of the useless offerings so com
monly made at that time.
I have assured the governor
of the Federal Reserve bank of
the twelfth district that the
bankers of Arizona will respond
manfully to his appeal.
With best wishes, I am,
Thomas E. Campbell,
Governor.

County Attorney Charles L.
Hardy, never the-less and not
withstanding the fact that his
hearing is defective, wants to
fight the Germaus, or other
enemies of our Uncle Sam. The
physicians of the local exemp
tion board recently ruled the
popular county attorney off be
cause they discovered that his
right ear drum had been punc
tured. Mr. Hardy failed to un
derstand just how one's defec
tive hearing could interfere with
one's ability to fight. He went
to Tucson last week and made
application to join the regular
army. Nothing stirring, said
the recruiting officer; ' under
the law, no men were eligible
for enlistment in the volunteer
service who had been disquali
fied by the examining physicians
of dralt boards." Sunday Mr.
Hardy, who comes from southern
righting stock, returned home,
disappointed, but like all loyal
Americans, still ready and will
ing to do "his bit," whenever
and wherever needed.
IMPORTANCE OF TIN IN THE WAR
Each day war necessities are
educating the American people
to new habits of thrift. This
was pointed to today by the
local manager of the Standard
Oil Company, Mr. Bosch, when
he referred to economies being
made by his company to help
conserve the supply of tin.
Heretofore large quantities of
Pearl Oil (kerosene) have been
sold in one and five gallon tin
cans, but this practice is being
discouraged to save tin.
The same Pearl Oil heretofore
sold extensively in tins is car
ried in bulk by dealears and can
can be purchased from them at
a small money saving as well as
at a saving in tin for the na
tion's needs.
So important is this matter of
tin conservation that it is the
patriotic duty of every Amer
ican to conserve the supply as
far as possible, and one way of
doing this is to buy kerosene j
and like commodities in bulk in
stead of in tin cans.

"OVER THE TOP."
The Grand Santa Cruz Club Carnival
Is a Big Success.
The Grand Carnival for the
benefit of the Santa Cruz Club,
staged for last night and to
night, at the Town Hall, is go
ing "over the top" in leaps and
bounds, socially and financially.
The mammoth street parade
yesterday afternoon was easily
the most spectacular ever wit
nessed in Nogales, the most at
tractive feature being the cages
of wild animals and their train
ers. Many attractive floats and the
Fire Department headed by Act
ing Chief Curtis and ex-Chief
Mix, helped to make the parade,
which was led by those past
masters in the art of entertain
ing, Doc Gustetter and Bob Lee,
I a big success.
Last night the lid was off at
the Town Hall, where hundreds
of soldiers and civilans, vied with
one another in having good time
and assisting in "getting the
money."
From cellar to roof, the home
of the Santa Cruz Club, was
crowded with merry-makers,
who had the time of their lives.
"They rambled and they gam
bled till the dealers cut 'em
down," or until the strong arm
of the law, headed by Mrs. Wirt
G. Bowman, and her lovely
assistants, raided the place and
hustled the whole gang, dealers
and players, to jail. All were
released affer being fined tea
cents each. Chief Fowler, who
knows, says many of the offen
ders, should have te:n sent up
for life.
There were booths everywhere
presided over by the fairest of the
fair, and handsome, courteous
gentlemen, Bracey Curtis, Bob
I.ee, Harry Karns, George
Butler, Louis Hudgin, Mr. Corl,
Wirt Bowman, Mayor Clagett,
Leslie Hardy, and many others,
who took the money with the
grace of a Robin Hood.
There was dancing and feast
ing, and, yes, love making too.
There'll be more of everything
again tonight, at the same time
and place.
You'll be sorry if you miss any
part of it.
Come and have a bully good
time.
HEIRS GET BACA FLOAT LAND
The lands of Baca float No. 3,
Comprising 99,289 acres and valu
ed at a million dollars, which
have been in controversy be
tween the Baca heirs and the
settlers for years were awarded
to the heirs yesterday at 4 o'clock
by Judge Bledsoe in the federal
court, says Thursday's Tucson
Citizen. The lands are located
in the Santa Cruz valley. The
issue of process against the set
tlers will be withheld for a re
asonable time in order to give
the litigatants an opportunity to
arrange a compromise between
themselves.
The decision goes the whole
length and sustains the report
of Special Master Edwin F.
Jones in every particular. Judge
Bledsoe approved the master's
findings and declared that the
ground had been thoroughly
covered from all angles and that
in view of this he would not
grant a motion for an appeal
nor a writ of error. An appeal
might be secured by application
to the circuit court, he said if
the defendants and their attor
neys so desired.
The suits were entitled Watts
and Davis vs. George Atkinson,
and others; James F. Bouldin
and others, vs. Joseph Aguayo
and others.
In discussing the case Judge
Bledsoe stated that the statute
of limitations did not begin to
run until the government survey
was approved and filed, which
was done in 1914. He concluded
that the plaintiffs had not been
guilty of laches such as wfbuld
prevent the court enforcing their
rights.
Monday evening Mr. Harry C.
Woodruff, vice president and
manager of the United States
Graphite Company, accompanied
by Mr. Joe Polin, returned from
a visit to great producing gra
phite mines located in Sonora,
about twenty miles from Minas
Prietas. On account of the re
ported presence of "bronco" In
dians in the vicinity of the mine,
friends of Manager Woodruff,
advised him not to make the
trip at this time. "Woody" said
"nothing doing, boys, if our
superintendent.Fred Carruthers,
and the others, take a chance,
I too will take one." He did.
Made the trip without mishap,
and returned to Saginaw with a
splendid report of conditions at
the mine, which is bigger and
better than ever. DECEMBER 15, 1917.
