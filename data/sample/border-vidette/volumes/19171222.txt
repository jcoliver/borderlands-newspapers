In its campaign for the saving
of coal the Fuel Administration
declares the average American
home is superheated. Eminent
American physicians are quoted
as saying that a room above G8
degrees Fahrenheit is too warm
for health and exposes the oc
cupauts to catarrhal diseases
and pneumonia.
Over in California one of the
great American patriots sent
100,000 dozen of eggs to New
Zealand where they retailed for
54 cents per dozen. At the same
time this patriotic sold eggs to
the people of his own state in
large quantities, but the retail
price was 60 cents per dozen.

That agricultural lands in Pi
nal county are worth money was
again demonstrated this week at
the sale of state land held at
Florence, when a tract of land
was purchased by a Mr. Stevens
of Long Beach, Calif., for ap
proximately $21,000. Immedia
tely after the sale was conclud
ed and he had been announced
as the purchaser, Stevens was
offered $4,800 more for the land
than he had just paid for it.
The offer was refused.
Perpetrator of one of the most
brutal murders in the history of
Pinal county, B. Mandich, slay
er of L. E. Beck, shift boss for
the Ray Consolidated, was this
week sentenced to from 15 to 25
years by the superior court of
Pinal county. Mandich killed
Beck at Ray July 7th last be
cause he had been discharged
for unsatisfactory work, the
murder being committed with a
heavy lantern, with which Man
dich beat Beck to death, kicking
him at the same time with his
heavy shoes.
The secretary of agriculture
announced recently that further
advance of grazing fees on the
national forests will be deferred
for the present. He also an
nounced that no change will be
made at this time in the existing
regulations governiug the is
suance of grazing permits for
more than one year. The rea
sons for this course have been
set forth by Secretary Houston
in an identical letter to the sec
retaries of the American Live
Stock Association and the Na
tional Woolgrowers' Association.
More than half of the 1,250
colored men who completed the
course at the reserve officers'
training camp at Fort Des

missioned as officers in the army.
Nearly 100 colored physicians
and surgeons have received com
missions as officers in the Me
dicai Reserve Corps. A full
fighting force of 30,000 colored
soldiers, including representa
tives in all branches of military
service will constitute the Ninety-second
Division, to be detail

Gen. Pershing.
Under the Arizona statute an
employer is liable for injury sus
tained by his employe, regard
less of negligence if the employe
was not himself at fault. The
supreme court of the state re
cently affirmed judgment in favor
of a mine employe who was in
jured by the escape of compress
ed air used in ventilating the
mine, when he opened a valve
under circumstances which in
volved contributory negligence.
(Inspiration Consolidated Copper
Co. vs. Mendez, 166 Pacific Re
porter, 279.) The law is upheld
as being a valid measure, sub
ject to exemption of liability
where the injured employe has
been guilty of contributory neg
ligence or has disregarded plaip
warning of danger given him by
his em ployer.
Phoenix, Arizona, Dec. 14.
You won't have to figure but
your own income tax all by your
self hereafter. The government
is going to send out men to help
you. It will be up to you to
hunt up these men, who will be
sent into every county seat town,
and some other towns besides,
to meet the people. Postmast
ers, bankers and newspapers
will be able to tell you when the
government's income tax man
will be around, and where to
tind him. He will answer your
questions, swear you to the re
turn, take your money, and re
move the wrinkles from your
brow. Returns of income for
1917 must be made between Jan
uary 1 and March 1, 1918.
"The government recognizes,"
Collector of Internal Revenue
Lewis T. Carpenter said today,
"that many persons experience
a good deal of difficulty In filling
out income tax forms. It recog
nizes too, that taxpayers resi
dent at points where collector's
offices are not easily accessible
find it hard to get proper in
struction in the law. Next year,
when every married person liv
ing with wife or husband and
having a net income of $2,000,
and every unmarried person not
the head of a family and haying
a net income of $1,000 for the
year 1917, must make return of
income on the form prescribed,
there will be hundreds in every
community seeking light on the
law, and help in executing their
returns. My own and every
other collection district in the
nation will be divided into dis
tricts, with the county as the
unit, and a government officer
informed in the income tax as
signed to each district. He wjll
spend hardly less than a week
in eacb county, and in som
counties a longer time, very like
ly in the court house at the
county seat town. In cities where
there are collector's branch offi
ces he will be there, and in other
cities possibly at the city hall.
My office will in due time advise
postmasters and bankers and
send out notices to the news
papers stating when the officer
will be in each county. It will
be unnecessary for prospective
taxpayers to ask my office for
forms on which to make returns.
The officer.who visits their coun
ty will have them.
"It may be stated as a matter
of general information that 'net
income' is the remainder after
subtracting expenses from gross
income. Personal, family, or
living expense is not expense in
the meaning of the law, the ex
emption being allowed to cover
such expenses.
"The new exemptions of $1,000
and $2,000 will add tens of thou
sands to the number of income
taxpayers in this district, inas
much as practically every farm
er, merchant, tradesman, pro
fessional man and salary worker
and a great many wage workers
will be required to make return
and pay tax.
"The law makes it the duty of
the taxpayer to seek out the col
lector. Many people assume
that if an income tax form is not
sent, or a government officer
does not call, they are relieved
from making report. This is
decidedly in error. It is the
other way round. The taxpayer
has to go to the government and
if he doesn't within the time
prescribed, he is a violator of
the law, and the government will
go to him with its penalties."
In the House of Represent
atives, December 3, 1917, Con
gressman Carl Hayden, of Aii
zona, introduced the following
bill, which was referred to the
Committee on the Judiciary and
ordered to be printed:
Be it enacted by the Senate
and House of Representative el
the United States of America in
Congress assembled, That the
term "deportation" as used in
this act shall mean the accomp
hshment of involuntary remov
al, without due process of law
and either with or without ap
plication of physical violence, .of
any person or persons from one
State to another State, or from
a State to a Territory, or from
one Territory to another, or from
either a State or Territory to the
district of Columbia, or the re
verse of any of these.
Sec. 2. That it shall be un
lawful and a violatiou of this act
for any parson, company, part
nership, or corporation, either
acting alone or by collusion or
conspiracy, or in concert, . with
another or otbers, to depot, or
cause or accomplish the depor
tation xf another person or per
sons, whether such deportation
is accomplished or sought to be
J effected by means of threats,
menaces, demonstrations of hos
tility, or ptting in fear of the
person or persons sought to be
or actually deported, or by
means of physical violence di
rected against or applied to such
person or persons.
Sec 3. That any attempt to
accomplish a deportation as pro
hibited in section two of this aut
shall be held and regarded as a
completed offense ' within the
meaning of that section and
shall be dealt with in like man
ner as though such attempt had
been successful in the accom
plishment of its. object.
Sec. 4. That the violation of
any provision of this act shall
constitute a misdemeanor, and
upon conviction thereof the of
fenders, if natural persons, shall
be punished by a fine of not less
than $2,000, or by imprisonment
for not less than two years, or
by both such fine and imprison
ment, or, if a corporation, by a
fine of not less than $10,000, and
the directing officers of a cor
poration found guilty under this
Act shall also be liable as in
dividuals, without abatement of
the liability of the corporation
as herein provided.
The editor has been appointed
acting postmaster pending the
appointment of a regular com
missioned official. As he has
become hardened in the past to
criticism heaped on him because
he happened to run a newspap
er, perhaps the biting comments
he will receive when a postoffice
patron fails to ge,t the letter he
expects or his mail sooner in the
morning than he should, will
not seem so severe were he not
so fat, as one angry citizen ac
cuses, or was able to grin at the
wrong time. Anyhow, here's
greeting and the hope that your
mail will always be full of pleas
ant things. Chandler Arizonan.
Knew He Had Gbie for Good.
Mrs. Hannah Thompson, whose
husband until recently had been
employed as a Pullman porter,
interrupted the proceedings in
the Harlem court in a hurried
effort to obtain a divorce, says
a New York news letter. She
was quieted down until a case
then being heard was disposed
of, and then questioned by a
magistrate. When she had ex
plained that her husband had
left the previous morning it was
suggested by the court that
there was no reason to believe
that he would not return, and
that Mrs. Thompson had better
wart before considering any
such move as a divorce action.
"But I knows that man ain't
never comin' back," explained
the excited negress. I was in
bed this morniu' when I beard
him gettin' out very quiet and
creepy. He put on his best
clothes new suit, straw hat,
patent leather shoes and a light
coat over his arm and I lay
very still makin' out I ain't
awake yet. He walks right to
the door, makes a big low bow
towards me and says: 4 Good
bye, cold feet, good bye." Judge
that nigger ain't goin' to come
back."
To Earl W. Heller belongs the
honor of being the first drafted
man from Pinal county to go to
France. Mr. Heller, who was
made master mechanic of his
battery at Camp Funston,. left
the night of December 8th for
some port in France, having re
ceived his orders the day pre
vious. Copper Camp.

among shippers, warehousemen
and others with whom they

The campaign at this time is
the rerult of resolution adopted
by the Railway Fire Protective
association at its recent St. Louis
con vention.
Vice President and General
Manager W. R. Scott, in charg
ing Southern Pacific men to re
double their vigilance and adopt
even more effective measures to
safeguard supplies, says:
"Iidevelops that the respons
ibity of feeding not only our
selves, but our allies, rests large
ly upon this nation. As all the
materials, supplies and foodstuffs
necessary for our domestic use,
the use of our armies and our
navy must be necessarily trans
ported over our railway systems,
the necessity for fire protection
becomes a patriotic duty. Any
amount of insurance under pre
sent world conditions is incap
able of replacing food and ma
terials that are destroyed.
WILL EXPLORE RINCON CAVES
The newly discovered caves of
the Rincon Mountains will be ex
plored, mapped and studied by a
party from the University head
ed by Dr. Byron" Cummings,
Aichaeologist and Director of
the Museum, during the Christ
mas University vacation.
The party will consist of a
number of students and Dr. C.
J. Sarle, Geologist of the Uni
versity. These caves are report
ed to make the Mammoth Caves
of Kentucky dwarf to insignifi
cance by their extent and it is
with a view to getting the exact
extent that the search will be
made. Also the caves show
evidence of having been occu
pied by a former people, the
condition of which will also be
studied.

CARNIVAL NOTES.
Chief of Police Bracey Curtis
was there all dolled up as an
English gentleman, from Boston
town.
Senator Harry Karns is there
when it comes to selling beaati
ful flowers. Lbw -Koller will
say he is.
Over seventeen hundred dol
lars in two nights, most of it
just for fun, is a good record for
Nogales' fun-loving people.
Doc Ferguson knows more
about roulette, than most people
say he does. When the bank
roll was gone, he paid in con
versation. Paint or no paint, into the jail
you went, if you didn't look
good to Mrs. Wirt Bowman, chief
ot police and her night captain,
Mrs. H. Li. Corl.
Chief of Police C. L. Fowler
saw to it that everything went
off without a hitch, and Judge J.
J. Chatham made the punish
ment fit the crime.
The jazz orchestra brought the
bacon home. Ask Leslie Hardy,
Bob Lee, Harry Grac?, Jack
Schleimer, George Butler, Wirt
Bowman, and the rest of 'em.
Everybody did his or her "bit"
toward making the Carnival a
big success, but the ladies, God
bless 'em, were on the job from
start to finish. Each and every
one deserves a medal.
The most pleasing feature of
the Carnival was the crowning
by Hon. Frank J. Barry of love
ly Ruth Bowman, niece of Wirt
G. Bowman, as Queen. His cor
onation speech was a "hum
dinger."

federal food administrator for
Arizona, Santa Cruz county has
a membership in the national
food administration of 300 fami
lies. Warren Mc Arthur, Jr., man
ager of the state food pledge
card campaign attributes trie
success of the recent drive in
Santa" Cruz county to the effi
cient working organization per
fected under the leadership of
Mr. Bracey Curtis of Nogales
and this same organization will
be asked to assist in securing
the observance of the revised
food program calling for two
meatless days a week and bacon
less breakfasts for eveiy day.
The tabulation of the returns
by states show that though Ari
zona secured but 75 per cent of
her allotment of signatures she
stands hign in point of actual
results in comparison with her
neighbors and with eastern and
southern states.
Kansas with a percentage of
92 and Iowa with 91 were the
honor states as to percentage of
families enrolled. Arizona sec
ured 51 per cent of the families
as conrpared to 65 per cent by
California, 56 per cent for Colo
rado, 26 per cent for Nevada
and 34 per cent for New Mexico
and 56 per cent for Utah.

pears to even better advantage
in comparison with the figures
for New York City where only
48 per cent of the families were
signed up and New York state
where the family percentage
was only 27.

Many thousands of
women suffering from
womanly trouble, have
been benefited by the use
of Cardui, the woman's
tonic, according to letters
we receive, similar to this
one from Mrs. Z. V. Spell,
ofHayne, N.C. "I could
not stand on my feet, and
just suffered terribly,"
she says. "As my suf
fering was so great, and
he had tried other reme
dies, Dr. had us
get Cardui. . . I began
improving, and it cured
me. I know, and my
doctor knows, what Car
dui did for me, for my
nerves and health were
about gone."
TAKE
The Woman's Tonic
She writes further: I
am in splendid health . . .
-can do my work. I feel I
owe it to Cardui, for I was
in dreadful condition."
If you are nervous, run
down and weak, or suffer
from headache, backache,
etc., every month, try
Cardui. Thousands of
women praise this medi
cine for the good it has
done them, and many
physicians who have used
Cardui successfully with
their women patients, for
years, endorse this medi
cine. Think what it means
to be in splendid health,
like Mrs. Spell. Give
Cardui a trial.
