The Spirit of Friendship.
This store looks upon its patrons not
merely as customers but as friends.
People purchase here because they
have friendly feeling for this store.
The cause which develops this friendly
feeling, may differ, in fact, they are
sure to differ. One's friendship for
the store is the result of finding good
values; another's is the result of effi
cient service and courteous treatment,
and so on.
Naturally this friendshiply feeling on
the part of our patrons is reciprocated
on our part. And this spirit of mutual
friendship is an impetus for greater
service and an incentive to ever-increasing
endeavor to make this store
a place where every visitor will feel
perfectly at home.

Steps were taken by the state
board of education at a special
session yesterday which will
assure the tilling of some 05
vacancies in the state, caused by
the inability of school boards to
secure properly qualified teach
ers. Governor Campbell has issued
a proclamation designating Sun
day, October 5th, as "American
ization Day." The people are
invited to hold public meetings;
churches are asked to devote at
least one service to the discus
sion of the Americanizing of
foreigners within our borders.
Within the past week fifteen
thousand doses of Aggressin
permanent immunity blackleg
vaccine have been sent from
Arizona to three cattle outfits in
Sonora, Mexico. This indicates
that some of the big cattle out
tits of northern Mexico are using
up-to date measures in prevent
ing disease.
Inspector of Customs J. S.
Kelly has seized .3500 head of
cattle on the land of L. A. Glenn
at Silver Creek, on the ground
that the cattle had been smug
gled across the international line
from Mexico. The federal offi
cers are making a close investi
gation of the matter and one of
them stated that sensational de
velopments might come to light
at any hour.
Ed. W. Stephens, secretary of
the livestock sanitary board, has
a big job on his hands re record
ing the 20,000 cattle brands,
many of which have become ob
solete. Already more" than 3000
applications for re recording
have been received. The legis
lature appropriated $4375 with
which to do the work. This
fund is nearly exhausted al
though the work is only well
started. Cattleman.
The Pima county bond issue
was passed recently by an over
whelming vote on the figures of
the five Tucson precincts alone.
If the vote is sustained through
out the county, the decision to
issue $1,500,000 worth of bonds
for good roads throughout the
county was reached by a vote of
603 for the bond issue to 105
against issuing the bonds. The
total vote cast in the five pre
cincts of Tucson was only 708,
showing there was practically
no opposition.
The location of oil claims has
extended from the Whetstone
mountains, where the San Pedro
Oil & Gas company have control
of 12,000 acres, to the border.
Claims are now located on the
west side of the Huachucas from
the San Rafael grant east along
the border, and it is reported in
the vicinity, that a company is
preparing to drill in the vicinity
of the head of the Jacquin
Creek. There is said to be con
siderable locating south of thle
Canille mountains.
Dean G. M. Butler, of the col
lege of mines and engineering,
has men enrolled in his depart
ment who came from many dif
ferent states and colleges. The
states represented are as fol
lows: California 7; Texas 6;
Illinois 4; New York 3; Michigan
3; Oregon 3; Colorado 2; and one
each from Washington, Ohio,
Kentucky, New Mexico, Geor
gia, Alabama, Tennessee, South

Senor Cubillas, of the Sonora
Bank and Trust Co., Nogales,
and Senores Puente and Bringas
of Sonora, Mexico, were up last
Sunday on a tour of inspection
of the San Pedro oil fields, says
the Santa Cruz Patagonian, of
last week. These gentlemen,
says the paper, were much im
pressed with what they saw and
learned, and went away with un
shaken faith in the strong oil in
dications found, and with no
misgivings as to the final suc
cess of this latest and greatest
new enterprise of the South
west. It is said Sonora capital
ists are to become heavy invest
ors in the stock of the new com
pany.

RANGES IN EXCELLENT SHAPE.
A recent report from Phoenix
says:
Moderate showers have fallen
in the Grand Canyon district,
also in eastern Arizona and New
Mexico. Ranges continue in ex
cellent condition, generally cov
ered with an abundance of for
age of various types. Immedi
ately north of the Rim in Navajo
county pastures have matured
to a considerable degree, partic
ularly the lighter grasses. Con
ditions in the Fort Apache In
dian reservation continue excel
lent and very good in the San
Carlos reservation. That all
classes of stock are approaching
the dry season under the most
favorable circumastances is re
ported by practically all corres
pondents. From the border sec
tions it is stated that cattle
pastured in Sonora during the
summer are returning to their
home ranges in tine condition.
Roundups are progressing in a
number of places.
Where soil conditions have
been favorable nearly all crops
outside of irrigated sections are
reaching maturity or being har
vested. Where crop failure has
occurred this season it has been
the result of very poor soil or
lack of cultivation. Wheat and
1 oats harvest is progressing in
I dryland sections with good yields
in prospect. In nearly all parts
I of the state corn, milo maize,
1 kafjir and cane are making the
I best showing in years. The
potato crop in the Flagstaff sec
tion may be reduced considera
bly as a result of blight said to
have affected a number of fields.
It is not possible to estimate the
amount of damage this early.
Favorable weather has enabled
the cotton crop again to approx
imate a normal condition and
picking has gone forward the
past week without interruption.

INFLUENZA.
A Few Suggestions for Prevention by
by Doctor C. B. Wiley.
The losses of the U. S. array
during the late war was 113,000.
The deaths from influenza in six
months in U. S. was 450,000.
There is so much that is not
known, compared to the little
that is known about influenza
that one hesitates to advise. In
fluenza (it's self) is not a serious
disease, but it prepares the
lungs for the germ? frequently,
almost constantly, found in the
upper respiratory mucous mem
brances which grow and cause
the numerous fatalities.
Early cases of influenza are
mid therefore beware of people
whoonly have a "cold."
Health departments can not
control influenza. The people
must be educated to protect
themselves. It is up to the in
dividual. Influenza spreads just
as fast, and no faster, than the
modes of transportation of a
country. Slow transportation
slow spread; fast transportation
a fast spread etc.
The mask has proven a fail
ure, it may protect your mind.
It may give some protection to
the other fellow if it is made
well.
Influenza is with us all the
year. About every twenty or
thirty years is a pandemic.
Common sense suggestions for
your protection:
Hands: Wash hands before
placing any thing in the mouth;
after having money in hands;
after being in any public place
or gathering.
Mouth: Wash mouth and
teeth four times daily-morning-noon-evening
and at bed time.
Nose and throat: Wash out
with normal salt solution (one
teaspoonful salt to a pint water)
before going to bed.
Public gatherings : If you
have a "cold" keep away from
people you do not want to pass
the infection .on. Remain at
home.
Keep away from any person
who has a "cold." Dress com
fortable. Sleep warm. Keep
feet dry.
The above is written and pub
lished for the benefit of the com
munity of Nogales, hoping that
these few simple suggestions,
may help avert the spread of
fluenza.

SCOTT WHITE WEDS.
A telegram dated Williams,
Arizona, September 29, says:
"Scott White, of Phoenix, and
Mrs. W. H. Chapman, of Detroit,
Mich., were married here last
night. The honeymoon, of about
ten days, will be spent on the
Grand Canyon.
"The bridegroom, now receiv
er of the United States land
office for Arizona, has been a
resident of the southwest for
. nearly 40 years. For six years
he was sheriff of Cochise county
and thereafter for a time man
ager of theCananea mines under
the Greene regime. He also
served in an early territorial le
gislature and was clerk of the
district court at Tombstone. The
bride is of a wealthy Detroit
family."
Scott White formerly resided
in Nogales, where he has many
friends all of whom join The
Border Vidette in wishing
him and his bride a long and
happy life as man and wife.
Mr. George D. Ryall, son of
Mr. George M. Ryall, the well
known promotor who for many
years has been operating in So
nora, was a stopover visitor in
Nogales this week a couple of
days on his way to Mazatlan,
Sinaloa, from Los Angeles. The
young gentleman, like his father,
is a live wire. He will make his
home at Mazatlan, where he will
represent a number of big Amer
ican firms including the Califor
nia and Mexico Steamship Co.,
of which Swayne & Hoyt, Inc.,
of Los Angeles, are general
agents; Union Hardware & Metal
Co., and Haas Baruch & Co., the
mammoth wholesale grocery firm
of San Francisco. George is
recently back from overseas
where he saw service with the
United States Navy. He's full
of pep, and bound to win.
Property of Frank Hereford on Craw
ford Street Will Be Subdivided.
A large realty transaction that
will be of great interest to the
pecple of Nogales was consum
mated yesterday when the ne
cessary legal papers were signed
by J. Li Schleimer, president of
the Border Realty and Invest
ment Co. of this city, and Franlt
Hereford, a wealthy capitalist of
Tucson, says Tuesday's Nogales
Herald.
The transaction embraces a
large tract of laud consisting of
20 acres fronting on Crawford
street and extending to the In
ternational line. This property
has been considered for many
years to be one of the best home
building tracts within the cor
porate limits of the ci8y.
The Border Investment and i
Realty company which has been
incorporated by J. T. Schleimer
and his brother A. I. Schleimer,
with a capital of 100,000, will
inaugurate a vast selling and
building campaign for Nogales
by the turning of this property
into a residential district.
Mr. Schleimer is to be congra
tulated for interesting Mr. Here
ford in the great possibilities of
Nogales and it is thought that
the converting of this prominent
tract into building lots will par
tially relieve the home shortage
congestion which stares Noga
les in the face.
The tract in question is locat
ed directly opposite the palatial
home of Jos. Wise on Crawford
street and work will begin in
the near future for its beautifi
cation, such as the marking of
streets and other improvements.
This will be the first subdivision
in Nogales which will have con
tour streets and boulevards and
a high building restriction.
Mr. Schleimer was associated
with the late George W. Dunbar
for many years and was instru
mental in building over 50 homes
in Nogales and opening many
new subdivisions.
In the near future an exten
sive selling campaign will be
inaugurated and the public is
advised to look for a real build
ing boom.

STOMACH TROUBLE
Mr. Marion Holcomb, of Nancy, Ky., says: "For quite
a tong while I suffered with stomach trouble. I would
have pains and a heavy feeling after my rncals, a most
disagreeable taste in my mouth. If 1 ate anything with
butter, oil or grease, I would spit it up. I began to have
regular sick headache. I had used pills and tablets, but
after a course of these, I would be constipated. It just
seemed to tear my stomach all up. I found they were
no good at all for my trouble. I heard
THEDFORD'S

me. I keep it in the house all the time. It is the best
liver medicine made. I do not have sick headache or
stomach trouble any more." Black-Draught acts on
the jaded liver and helps it to do its important work of

use in time of need. Get a package today. If you feel
