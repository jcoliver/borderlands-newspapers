Capt. L. W. Mix, of Nogales
chairman of the committee which
raised funds and bought the
silver service for the battleship
Arizona is in receipt of a letter
from the manufacturers, Reed
& Barton, conveying intelligence
of the delivery of the goods at a
navy yard, to be delivered to
the ccmmander of the battleship
Arizona.
Governor Hunt of Arizona and
Governor Alexander of Idaho,
were early in the field in the
issuance of proclamations for
enrollment week of the United
States Bojts' Working Reserve.
Governor Hunt's proclamation
has been sent to all high school
principals and county school
superintendents, to be given
publicity in the schools.
Authority has been given for
the opening of two new state
banks. At Ray, the Merchants
and Miners bank has capitaliza
tion of $50,000. At its head is T.
M. Quebedeaux, with C. L.
Wolfe, as cashier. April 1 has
b en set as the opening date. At
Ciifton a new bank is the People's
Bank and Trust company, with
$50,000 paid up capital.
Improvements to the buildings
of the Tempe Normal school
provided for in a $50,000 appro
priation made by the last legisla
ture are being rushed tocomrle
tion and the new auditorium
will barring any unforeseen
delays, be ready for commence
ment exercises in May, according
to Leroy A. Ladd of the com
mission on state institutions.
It took the jury in the case of
B. P. Winsor, the Clarkdale
smelter guard accused of the
murder of Manuel Orosco, just
forty five minutes to declare the
defendant not guilty. A number
of reputable witnesses testified
that Orosco was of a quarrelsome
disposition and that officers had
frequently warned him he would
run into the wrong man some
time. The Food Administration has
the interes of the farmer at heart,
as is shown by the activity
they are taking to right a great
wrong and injustice that has
been done the Arizona farmer,
because the nearest wheat ter
minal has been Los Aogeles.
They have requested that Tuc
son be the Arizona terminal and
that the price be fixed at $2.15
per bushed at that point.
The Smith Hughes Act which
passed Congress Februay 17,
1917, and the provisions of which
were accepted by the last legis
lature, provides Arizona with
automatically increase until 1926,
when it will reach the perman
ent fund of $30,000. These
amounts must be matched dollar
for dollar by the state. For the
year 1917-1918, therefore, there
will be available for vocational
educational in Arizona, $30,000.
Several hundred thousand
head of sheep are being sheared
in the Salt River valley, a large
proportion held on the alfalfa
and early grain fields, though
the grass is starting on the
plains, favored by the late rayps.
More than half the flocks have
been brought in by rail from the
north, owing to the lack of feed
on the trails from the forest
reserves. Despite the high cost
of feeding alfalfa hay and oil
cake, the ewes and lambs will
be "turned off" much earlier
this year than ever before giving
even better profit than in ordin
ary years.
It would seem that the Salt
River valley is to have more
cotton growers on a gigantic
scale, if the incorporating of the
United States Rubber company,
under the laws of Arizona, means
anything. Those who know,
state that this large corporation
intends to clear up large tracts
of the desert land and raise
cotton, as the Goodyear Tire
and Rubber company has done.
The long staple cotton has
made the Salt River valley
famous throughout the world,
and it is hoped that more of our
desert land may be reclaimed in
this commendable way.
Cattlemen are rapidly coming
to the conclusion that it pays to
have a little farming land where i
enough forage feed can be raised
to save poor cattle in times of
drouth. Cattle are so valuable
these days that it pays to go to
considerable expense to save
every one of them.
As a result of a recent trip
made to Douglas by William T.
Haley of the war trade board at
Nogales arrangements have been
made with the British consular
service in Mexico to assist in
preventing the juggling of jute
bags, packing, etc., may be made
to points in Mexico without the
same being billed in care of Alex
Baird, Jr., British vice consul at
Douglas, or if the shipment is
for a poiDt farther south it
should be consigned in care of
John Davison, British vice con
sul at Guaymas.
Spring prices for cattle have
lately developed. Nine thousand
medium grade Arizona yearlings
are reported sold at $35 for one
and $13 for twos. Others at $40
and $11, and twos at $50 and
threes at $60. California is hold
ing some twos at $60 straight,
native cattle, although no sales
are reported. California is in
the market for stock cattle and
steers. In fact, the greatest
activity known in years in now
going on in the cattle trading.
Range and pasture is held high
and is hard to get.
Major Abbott Boone, U. S. A.,
has arrived in Douglas for a few
days' visit with his cousin,
Harry E. Pickett. Major Boone
has just completed three year's
service in the Philippines, and
is transferred from the Ninth
cavalry to the Fifteenth, which
left here a few days ago and on
expiration of leave expects to
join the regiment. Major Boone
was formerly in Douglas in 1912,
with a detachment of the Third
cavalry and is delighted to
ret-rrn for a visit. Major Boone
is a graduate of West Point,
1917. International.
An army surgeorn has found a
drug akin to iodioe and of valu
able antiseptic properties in the
greasewood of the Arizona
plains, otherwise known as
larrea Mexicana, creosote bush
and candle weed. That's nothing
especially new. The Mexicans
find in the greasewood leaf one
of their most common household
remedies, used as a poultice
externally or as an internal
lubricant, while experiment has
found that a decoction of the
leaves is of large value in the
cure of colds or even for the
relief of bay fever. Arizona.
Cattlemen continued negotia
tions Friday for large amounts of
cattle from Mexico and the Tuc
son district and it is estimated
that before the present move
ment is concluded the deals will
aggregate more than half a
million dollars. R. G. Brady of
Tucson as now engaged in
shipping about 500 head to
fattening ranges in Nebraska. H.
L. Robinson of El Paso is bring
ing across 2500 head from
Mexico, and J. C. Kinney has
contracted for more than 8000
head.
PROSECUTE TAX SLACKERS.
"Tax slackers will be prose
cuted as vigorously and relent
lessly under the War Revenue
Act as draft slackers were pro
secuted under the selective
service act. The aid of all good
citizens is invoked in bringing to
justice the man who deliberately
seeks to evade his just share of
the war burden."
This was the statement today
of Commissioner of Internal
Revenue Daniel C. Roper. With
only eight days left in which to
file income tax returns he has
practically completed the
organization of a huge dragnet
for bringing into camp all per
sons who fail to tile their returns
by April 1. Revenue officers in
every section of the country are
checking up returns with a view
to beginning prosecutionsagainst
tax dodgers. The word has gone
forth that such offenders need
expect no leniency.
"Through its educational
campaign the Bureau of Internal
Revenue has endeavored to cover
the field so thoroughly Ghat
ignorance of the law cannot be
consistently offered as an ex
cuse," said Commissioner Roper
today. "The press, the four
minute men, the State and
County Councils of National
Defense, the field force of the
Department of Agriculture and
other Government departments,
banks, post offices and hundred
of volunteers agencies have
cooperated in bringing home to
the taxpayer his duty.
"The man who failed to re
gister under the selective service
act was regarded by the War
Department as a slacker and
prosecuted as such. The man
who fails to file his income tax
will be regarded as a money
slacker', and when discovered,
as he will be, will be made to
suffer full penalties of the law.
"To the credit of the Nation it
may be said that I have gratify
ing and conclusive evidence that
these income taxes will be paid
by the great majority of the
American people cheerfully and
willingly. But the duty of the
honest man does not end with
the payment of his own tax. I
call upon him to aid in bringing
into camp the tax dodger. A man
so niggardly as to seek to evade
what his representatives in Con
gress have declared to be his
just share of a tax imposed for
the support of our arms is
deserving of no consideration
and will receive none.
"Congress has distributed this
tax justly and equitably. The
rate i 4 fixed so that the rich man
and the men of moderate means
are assessed, each according to
his income. No man can offer the
excuse that his neighbor escapes
what he is made to pay. There
fore, it is incumbent upon all
good citizens to aid in carrying
out the intents and spirits of the
law, which is that the burden
of the war tax be evenly distri
buted and every man compelled
to pay his just quota."
THE PATAGONIA DISTRICT.
The Flux mine started work
Wednesday morning with a small
force of men. As was reported
in the Patagonian last week, Mr.
F. B. Kollberg will manage the
work. It is the intention of the
new company to use the new
system of separating the values
from the mine that was patented
by Mr. Kollberg and is used
successfully in Bisbee and Ne
vada. The machinery has been
ordered, and as soon as it ar
rives the work will commence
on a larger scale.
That the opening of the Flux
will be of great benefit to Pata
gonia is apparent, as it is near
by, and if the new system
proves itself on this property,
it may revolutionize the mining
industry in this district.
The company has been organ
ized under the name of The
Flux Syndicate. Mr. F. C.
Kollberg is manager, and the
directors are: F. B. Kollberg, J.
M. McGregor and Tom Stafford.
Mr. Murray Saunders, who has
a bond and lease on the Hard
shell mine, has sent word from
New York that H. K. Welsh will
arrive in a day or two to start
operations on this famous old
property. Mr. Welsh will be in
charge of the work as superin
tendent. Mr. Saunders has se
sured finaneial backing, and it
is expected to develop the mine
on a large scale. A new shaft
will be sunk, and it is likely
that the caving system will be
the best to use on the property.
The Blue Eagle mine, owned
by Lou Stevens and the heirs
of his late brother, Harry, will
start work immediately upon the
arrival of Mr. F. A. Shaw from
New York. Mr. Shaw secured
an option on the property some
time ago and went to New York
and other eastern cities to inter
est capital in the mine. His
mission was successful, and the
mine will begin development
work under the management of
John Glasson, who lately was
superintendent of the Bradford
mine, which has temporarily
suspended operations. Santa

GROW MORE SPRING WHEAT.
The planting of an increased
acreage to spring wheat and the
production of an increased sup
ply of other food products and of
live stock, especially hojjs, is re
commended in its supplementary
food production program issued
by the United States Department
of Agriculture.
This program reemphasizes
and amplifies the food production
program for 1918 issued by the
department in August, 1917, and
other suggestions made in the
fall and the first of this year
regarding increased pork pro
duction and increased production
of foodstuffs in the South. Taken
in connection with the recocn
mendations previously made, it
suggests in full the proposals
which the department thinks it
desirable to offer with a view to
secure enough meat and dairy
products, cereals, sugar, and
other staple and perishable food,
wool, and cotton for the Nation,
its armies, and the allies. It
gives suggestion for the ap
proaching spring operations,
based upon the latest available
information as to the conditiou
of the fall-planted crops of
winter wheat and rye and as to
the number of meat and dairy
animals for 1917. They represent
the best thought of the specia
lists of the department who have
had the benefit of advice from
agricultural leaders throughout
the country.
SOME PEACE OFFICER.
Town Marshal Fowler's motor
cop, J. H. Jake, is a natural
born peace officer. He just
naturally feels the presence of a
thief, if one comes within a block
of him.
Last Wednesday Rumaldo
Limon, said to be an escaped
murderer from the state peniten
tiary, stole Mrs. Harry Hines'
automobile from in front of the
Catholic church and drove to
ward the Mexican line.
Jake was standing in front of
the police station when the car
tolled by with the escaped con
vict at the wheel. He immediate
ly gave chase, and notwithstand
ing the fact that his motor threw
a tire, captured his man before
he could cross the international
line.
Yep, Jake is sure some peace
officer. Marshal Fowler thinks
be is; so does Mrs. Hines.

she writes: "I had a
general breaking-down
of my health. I was in
bed for weeks, unable to
get up. 1 had such a
weakness and dizziness,
. . . and the pains were
very severe. A friend
to 1 me I had tried every

Cardui ? . . . I did, and
soon saw it was helping
me . . . After 12 bottles,
I am strong and well."

The Woman's Tonic
Do you feel weak, diz
zy, worn-out? Is your
lack of good health caused
from any of the com
plaints so common to
women? Then why not
give Cardui a trial? It
should surely do for you
what it has done for so
many thousands of other
women who suffered it
should help you back to

Ask some lady friend
who has taken Cardui.
She will tell you how it
helped her. Try Cardui.
