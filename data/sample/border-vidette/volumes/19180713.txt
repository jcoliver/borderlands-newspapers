Two horse? were taken last
Friday night from the corral at
the ranch of Clyde McPherson

of them was the property of

found. Patagonian.
The charge of murder aqrainst
J. T. Holmes for the killing of
Wm. Pemberton at Kyrene, was
dismissed in the justice court in
Phoenix, Sturday. This clears
Holmes of all criminal liability
for the shooting of the Pember

Col. Wm. McDermott has with
drawn his acceptance of the ap

week by Governor Hunt, as a
member for Arizona of the Na

his membership in several other
national patriotic societies would
occupy all of his spare time.
In accordance with instruc
tions leceived from the sugar
division of the food administra
tion, telegrams have been sent
by the federal food administra
tor for Arizona to all county and
deputy county food administra
tors stationed on the Mexican
border, asking them to take im
mediate steps to prevent the
sale of sugar to persons taking
it across the line.
J. J. Ward, who was sent to
the penitentiary last year with
his son Bufford for the shooting
of Mark Turney in the Whet
stone mountains, has been pa
roled and is now raising cotton
on a place near Chandler. He
has a fine crop this year and ex
pects to turn out a big lot of the
staple stuff. His son, young
Tom Ward, is in Tucson getting
a petition signed for the parol
of Bufford and many are sign
ing it.
To prevent further cattle rust
ling along the border between
El Paso, Texas, and Las Cruses,
New Mexico, the number of line
riders will be increased. This
was decided at a meeting of
Panhandle and Southwestern
Stockmen's Association officials
last Wednesday afternoon at El
Paso. In addition to the new
riders, the ranchmen of Dona
Ana county have agreed to
furnish men to operate with the
patrol. .

Officer Camacho of the police
department, stationed at Stone

been equipped with a traffic
whistle and he is trying to in
struct automobile drivers in the
use of signals. They know that
the right hand is extended when
the driver intends to turn to the

intends to turn to the left, but
many of them do not know that
they hold the hand straight out

The people having in charge
the petitions that have for their
object the initiation of the act
for the re establishment of cap
ital punishment in the state of
Arizona, now have enough signa
tures to put that measure upon
the ballot at the forthcoming
election. The establishment of
capital punishment is necessary
for the safety of the public and
it is to be hoped that the people
will see that it receives their ap
probation at the general election
next November.
Yesterday William Flanigan
brought in from the United East
ern its weekly shipment of bul
lion, which we understand was
above 50,000 in value. The
United Eastern is making a re
cord for itself these days in the
production of bullion. During
the month of June the bullion
shipments amounted to approxi
mately $200,000, the largest in
the history of the property. At
the present time this is the
largest producer of gold in the
United States, and will continue
to be the one big property for a
long time to come. Miner.
C. M. McCutcheon, world's
champion rapid fire pistol shot,
is stationed at Nogales, where
he is a member of the regular
machine gun company, giving
instruction in marksmanship.
Because of his high record as a
marksman he has been offered a
commission in the army as cap
tain. Mr. McCutcheon is aerad-

It seems Arizona has suffered
less from drouth during the last
two years than most parts of the
Southwest. While it has been
very dry in most parts and grass
has been very short, the per
centage of Cattle that have died
has been light. One reason for
this is that Arizona has princi
pally browse ranges and when
plenty of water and salt is pro
vided for the cattle, there are
very small losses. Many of the
cattlemen realize this and wells
are being put down on most of
the ranges. The Cattleman.

Outside of the intarest in cop
per and manganese there is no
more interesting situation at
present from the stock market
standpoint than is to be found in
the silver industry. The pre
sent price of one dollar an ounce
for silver is the highest price in
about twenty-five years. The
average price of the metal for
twenty years prior to the pre
sent war was 58 cents an ounce.
Silver is extensively required in
manufacturing processes, aside
from its use for coinage and
trade purposes. In 1908 the use
of silver in the arts grew from
about 23.800,000 ounces to about
29,890,000 ounces in the year
1915. Today the industrial re
quirements for silver are said to
be not less than 100,000,000
ounces, or more than half of
the silver output of the entire
world.
Arizona grades first in quality
among the states mentioned, ac
cording to market prices at
which the several lints are sold.
Arizona produced last year
24,000 bales of cotton. This
year's crop will be close to 50,
000 bales. This acreage now
is divided thus: Salt River val
ley. 70,000 acres, all long staple;
other districts, 5.000 acres, long
staple; Yuma districts, 17,000,
short staple. Total state acre
age, 92,000.
Fourteen thousand bales of
long staple were produced in
the Salt River valley last year,
and Yuma produced 8,000 bales
of short staple. Besides these
staples, there was produced in
Arizona (Yuma district), 200
bales of Durango cotton, which
soia at iii cents a pound, or a
little better than the short staple
cotton of Yuma and California
The short staple market for last
year s crop averaged 26 cents a
pound, as against 67 cents a
pound for the long staple as
grown in the Salt River valley
Seed last year sold on an aver
age at 58 a ton.
Mr. Harrison furnished a com
parison as follows: In 1914,
cotton seed sold at 15 a ton as
against 58 a ton this year.
Long staple in 1914 sold at 15
cents a pound, as against 70
cents this year. Long staple in
1915 sold at 22 cents and cotton
seed that year sold at 15 a ton.
Long staple in 1916 sold at 43
cents a pound and cotton seed
at 45 a ton. Yuma Sun.

Harvey Greer, 19 years of age
and a native of Tennessee, is
the kind of conscientious object
or that the country is proud of.
"I want to enlist." he told
Sergeant R. R. Mergenthal, of
the local U. S. Marine Corps re
cruiting station, at Stockton,
California.
"You're mighty young." re
plied Mergenthal, "why do you
want to enlist?"
"Because my conscience hurts
me," replied young Greer. "I'm
afraid the war might be over be
fore I'm twenty-one. Then the
boys would come home and ask
me why I hadn't been in it and
I object conscientiously to hav
ing no excuse to offer."

America's groat corn crop, exceed
Ins .'.otw.ooo.ooo bushels, will save the
world's food situation, officials of th
United States food administration be
Heve. .
Corn Is the nation's best food ceres',
housewives are beginning to re-alls.
It contains nil the elements needed ta
keep the body in a state of health and
when used according to the scores o
tried recipes, especially when com
blncd with an added portion of oil or
fut, will sustain Itfc Indefinitely. In
dlun warriors In colonial days lived on
parched corn alone for many days at a
time, and at Valley Forge parched
corn was at times the sole ration oj
the Continental soldiers.
Owing to transportation difficulties
caused by the wur the corn crop moved
more slowly to market this year than
ever before. Now, however, the cereal
is reaching the millers nnd consumers.
In the meantime the nation's surplus
wheat has been sent to Europe.
Today there arc approximately SO
bushels of corn for every American.
This quantity is greater by five bush
els than In former years.
Corn hns become the nation's main
stay In the crisis of war.
Just as this cereal saved the first
American colonists from famine on
many occasions. Just as It served as a
staple food during the War of the Rev
olution and during the Civil War, Kins
Corn has again come to the front ha
the nation's battle with autocracy.
Corn meal Is finding greatly Increas
ed use In the making of ordinary white
bread. Hundreds of housewives and
many of the Inrger bakers are mixing
20 per cent, corn meal with wheat
flour to make leavened broad. This
kind of a mixture is worked and baked
In the same recipes nnd with Ihe same
methods that apply to straight wheat
bread.
Corn bread using corn meal entlrev
ly Is gaining n creates popularity
tlinn ever before. Housewives are
coming to realize Hint every pound of
wheat saved In America means a pound
of wheat released for shipment to the
nations with which America Is associ
ated in the war.
There nre n score of corn products
that today possess unusual Importanco
for Americans. ( 'orn syri'p for sweet
ening corn cakes anil buckwheat cakes
BRd for use in Ihe kitchen Instead of
granulated sugar Is one of the lending
products made from corn.
Corn oil. excellent for frying and for
every oilier purpose filled by salad oils,
is appearing on the market In large
quantities. It comes from ihe germ ot
the corn.

"EQUAL RIGHTS TO ALL."
Democratic Candidate for Governor
Fully Explains His Position.
Mr.
not overlook this opportunity to
point out to you what, I believe
to be the paramount duty of the
Democrats of the State in this
great hour ot the world's crisis.
Every sign of these terrible days
of war and revolution changes
with time, and no politician dare
venture to conjecture the effect
of these changes; therefore, it
behooves us to search our hearts
through and through and make
them ready for a new day, a day
I hope and believe, of greater
opportunity, and greater pros
perity for the average mass of
struggling men and women, and
of greater safety and opportun
ity for the whole world.
Let the Democratic party,
therefore, forget everything but
the new service they are to be
called upon to render. The days
of political and economical re
construction which are ahead of
us, no man can assess; but we
know this, that every program
must be thoroughly purged of
selfish interest, that no party
must try to serve itself, but
every party must try to serve
humanity. The task is a very
practical one, meaning that every
program must be tested by this
question only; is it just; is it for
the benent of the average man
without influence or privilege;
does it embody in real fact the
highest conception of social jus
tice and right dealing, without
respect of person or class, or
particular interest?
This is a high test. It can be
met only by those who have
genuine sympathy with the
masses, a real insight into their
needs and opportunities. The
candidate who rises to this test
will receive the support of the
people, because he deserves it.
With personal regards, I am.
Very truly yours,

W. W. Edwards.
Douglas, Arizona.
Dear Mr. Edwards:
This is in reply to your very
highly appreciated letter of June
28th, from which I learn that
yourself and others have not,
from the reading of my platform
as published, been able to clear
ly understand my position on
the question that seems to be
uppermost in the minds of the
people at this time; namely, the
relationship now existing be
tween Capital and Labor, and
the future protection of the
rights of both.
In order that my position may
be more clearly defined, I take
this opportunity to say to you,
and others, that if I am elected
Governor, I shall exercise all
the ability I possess to be fair
to all the people of the State,
regardless of what their finan
cial, social or political standing
may be. I will exert my full
strength and ability to give am
ple and complete protection to
every dollar of capital invested
in legitimate business enter
prises. I will also see that the
laboring men and women of Ari
zona have a square deal, and
that every protection that law
affords will be exercised to the
end that those who toil in the
mines, on the farms, on the rail
roads, and in every other field
of industry, may be protected in
the exercise of their legitimate
rights. In other words, so far
as in me lay, I will protect and
encourage right and without
fear or favor, condemn and, if
possible, prevent wrong.
In my efforts to bring about
the things herein enumerated, I
will at all times use care and
deliberation, and following the
dictates of my nature, I shall
never be found assuming a
"straddling" attitude toward any
question affecting the personal
or property rights of the people.
I have always been, and am
now, a consistent believer in the
equal rights of the employer and
the employed, and feel that on
account of this neutral attitude,
I shall be better able to serve
both than another, prejudiced
against or in sympathy with one
side or the other.
While the question of Labor
and Capital is an important one,
and should receive its full meas
ure of consideration, yet I can
