Because there is plenty of fod
der in Arizona and a correspond
ing lack in neighboring states,
thousands of sheep and cattle
are being shipped into Arizona,
according to Dr. R. J. Hight,
state veterinarian, who says that
the state board is called upon
almost daily to grant permits for
the shipment of stock: from other
states into Arizona. Sheep es
pecially, have been coming into
the state rapidly during the past
month. It is estimated by Dr.
Hight that 25,000 sheep have
been shipped into Arizona from
New Mexico and Texas during
the past thirty days on account
of drouth in those states which
has destroyed the feed. The

The La Osa Cattle and Land
company of Pima county have
sold their big ranch and cattle
holdings to George Elliott, of
Midland, Texas, for $500,000
cash. The trade was engineer
ed by J. P. and Cliff Robertson
of El Paso and is the biggest
deal pulled off in Arizona for
several years. There are thous
ands of acres of patented land
and thousands of head of cattle
and horses in the outfit, besides
thousands of acres of leased
lands all highly improved with
spacious ranch buildings and
hundreds of miles of wire fence.
This big range is capable of car
rying many thousand more cat
tle than are now on it and it is
the intention of Mr. Elliott to
place more cattle there from his
big Texas ranges.
J. C. Kiuney, president of the
La Osa Company, handled the
business for his company, his
principal associates being Ra
mon Elias, Jose Camou and W.
B. Kibbey. The Palo Alto and
Las Moras ranches with their
big highly finished ranch houses
are included in the transaction.
The La Osa people still have big
holdings in Pima and Santa Cruz
counties and in Sonora and will
continde in the cow business.
The new comer was attracted to
this part of Arizona by articles
read in The Arizona Cattleman.
The Fifth Annual Southern

The Duquesne Mining and Re
duction Company is shipping
about 200 tons of ore a day. It
is possible that, owing to a
shortage cf cars at Zorrilla,
more of the ore than has been
shipped from Patagonia by this
company will be diverted this
way. The Duquesne concern has
sold the steam power plants
both at Duquesne and Washing
ton Camp to an El Paso, Texas,
wrecking company, which in
turn has sold the powerful en
gines to Texas ice factories. The
machinery was shipped this
week from Patagonia. Electric
power has been used in the Du
quesne company's reduction
plant, as it is more economical
in many ways. Patagonian.
What's the Use of Money Anyway Un
less We Win the War.
This is the reply to the man
who says, "I can do better with
my money than buying Liberty
Bonds."
He cannot do better. He can
not do as well. He means that he
can obtain a higher interest rate.
Let us suppose that everyone,
or even a large number of men,
talked this way. The loan would
fail. That would mean the defeat
of civilization, and the triumph
of Germany.
Tried almost beyond human
endurance, our allies might "lie
down," discouraged, disgusted.
"Unlikely," you say, "they will
fight on." This raises a point
which is not yet thoroughly
understood It is money that is
going to win this war. The
supply of bravery amongst our
boys and our allies is ample;
what they all need, what they
must have, is money.
What wquld be the result of a
wavering attitude on the part of
our allies? Germany would take
heart, possibly would make one
supreme effort, and open the
way for an invasion of this
Country, which our own fleet
might not be able to frustrate.
Even supposing that as a
result of her great effort, Ger
many was successful enougbt
merely to force a draw, and an
inconclusive peace, what would
happen? Her every energy would
be bent towards the object of
invading this Country at the
earliest moment possible in order
to replenish her bankrupted
stores of money and supplies.
Let us presume that Germany
has been so far successful that
tbe war is brought to our shores,
and our export trade is at a
standstill. Do you realize what
would be the condition of trade?
It would be paralyzed. Markets
would fall to pieces, industries
would be stopped, everywhere
there would be country-wide un
employment. Enormous indem
nities would have to be paid to
Germany to call off her armies;
taxes so enormous that they
would stagger the imagination,
would have to be imposed, and
the man who said, "I can do bet
ter with my money than buying
Liberty Bonds, would feel him
self to be the most foolish and
mistaken man on earth. His
dollar that he could "do better"
with, would be worth maybe
twenty five to fifty cents to him.
Truly What's the use of
money, anyway, unless we win
this war? She IJortlct Wx&zttt.

BULLOCK VISITS NOGALES.
This District May Get Branch Office
of Export Board.
"Last Sunday Alexander H.
Bullock, representative of the
war trade board at Washington,
was in Nogales for the purpose
of gathering data from shippers
and exporters, which he will
carry to Washington to present
to the War Board, after which it
will be determined whether a
branch of the license board will
be established in this district,
probably at El Paso.
The distinguished visitor was
entertained at dinner at The No
gales Cafe, by Mayor Clagett,
Collector Hardy, members of the
Chamber of Commerce, and a
committee of Tucson business
metn consisting of the following
named gentlemen, who motored
up from the old town with Mr.
Bullock: Alfred Goldsmith, L.
H.Sporleder, George Kitt and
E. JG. Sporleder.
After dinner Mr. Bullock ad
dressed a number of shippers
and'exporters at the Santa Cruz
Club, during which he said:
VTne only difficulty ih expor
tation to Mexico, will be with
goods that the United States and
our . allies are short of . Even
though we suffer ourselves, we
must back up our allies. I un
derstand there is not much flour
and sugar in Mexico. Flour and
sugar in this country and in the
countries of our allies is becom
ing more scarce each day. The
export board takes into consider
ation, amojDg other things, the
country to which goods is ship
ped. But shippers in this dis
trict are not so much contronted
with this as'the shippers on the
sea coast, fcr I believe that
goods shipped into Mexico will
be used by Mexicans and will
not reach the enemy.
"We are greatly in need of
many supplies, such as steel and
other materials. Our allies are
also short of these and we must
guard them carefully.
"Whether a branch office of the
export and license board will be
located in this district, will be
determined by the War Board
after my report is submitted,
upon my return to Washington.
There are only fourteen offices
in the country, all of which are
on the seaboard except two, one
at St. Louis, the other at Chi
cago. The expert board consists
of only four members as its
head. They are Melville Mc
Cormick, Dr. A. N. Taylor, T.
D. Jones and J. P. White.
"It is the desire of the Board
that there should be closer co
operation between the border
trade and the department at
Washington."
During the afternoon Mr. Bul
kck conferred with a number of
shippers. He was furnished
with interesting valuable data
by J. B. Bristol, secretary of the
Chamber of Commerce, Collector
of Customs C. E. Hardy, and
others.
In the evening the distinguish
ed visitor and the committee
from Tucson, motored back to
that :city.
B. SMYT.HE VISITS SONORA.
Mr. B. Smythe, well known
newspaperman of Los Angeles,
was a member of a party of land
investors from the Golden State,
who last Wednesday evening re
turned from Noria, Sonora, Mex.,
where they accompanied Fred.
Hilliker, the Sonora land man,
who during the past few years
has interested many investors
in the south country, where
there are splendid opportunities
for those who understand the
the farming game.
. Mr. Smythe who represents
the . Western Empire, was . de
lighted with the wonderful south
country, where he found every
thing 'quiet' and peaceable, not
withstanding the wild penny-aline
lies being sent broadcast,
by persons who know absolute
ly nothing about conditions in
the south country.
At the present time there is
unusual activity in the vicinity
of Noria, where Manager A. M.
Couard of. the Sonora Consoli
dated Mining & Smelting Co.,
has resumed operations in the
Cobre Grande mine, with Fred.
Alford of this city as superintendent.

Order to Show Cause Why Order of
Sale of Real Estate Should
Not Be Made.
The Spirit of Friendship,
This store looks upon its patrons not
merely as customers but as friends.
People purchase here because they
have friendly feeling for this store.
The cause which develops this friendly
feeling, may differ, in fact, they are
sure to differ. One's friendship for
the store is the result of finding good
values; another's is the result of effi
cient service and courteous treatment,
and so on.
Naturally this friendshiply feeling on
the part of our patrons is reciprocated
on our part. And this spirit of mutual
friendship is an impetus for greater
service and an incentive to ever-increasing
endeavor to make this store
a place where every visitor will feel
perfectly at home.

Up to midnight, September 12th, during a period of
82 months, we sold and delivered to tire dealers more
United States Tires than we sold to dealers during the
entire 12 months of 1916.
This phenomenal sales increase was made notwithstanding our
epoch-making sales increases of 1916 over 1915.
These record-breaking sales increases of 1917 over 1916 and
our record-breaking sales increases of 1916 over 1915 definitely and
finally prove three facts:
1. The supremacy of United States Tires.
2L The fact that the vast army of automobile owners who used
United States Tires in 1916 are using them in 1917 on the sheer
merit of their experience.
3. The fact that another vast army of automobile owners have been
won over to the use of United States Tires in 1917 on the sheer
nir tires over other tires that they have tried.)

Many thousands of

been benefited by the use
of Cardui, the woman's
tonic, according to letters
we receive, similar to this
one from Airs. Z. V. Spell,
of Ilayne, N. C. "I could
not stand on my feet, and
just suffered terribly,''
she says. "As my suf
fering was so great, and
he had tried other remedies,-
Dr. had us
get Cardui. . . I began
improving, and it cured
me. - 1 know, and my
doctor knows, what Car

nerves and health were
about gone.'
