A GREAT STOCK RANCH.
Frank M. King Interested in State of
Michigan Lands.
The following telegram from
Marquette, Michigan, will be of
interest to many friends of Prank
M. King, formerly proprietor of
The Border Vidette, now
owner of The Arizona Cattleman
of Tucson, and Mr. J. Y. Canon,
of El Paso, Texas:
Marquette, Mich. One of the
largest cattle ranches in the
United States is being develop
ed in School-craft county by the
recently organized Cloverland
Cattle company, which now owns
nearly 60,000 acres of cutover
lands. It is a stock company,
with J. Y. Canon, of El Paso,
Texas, and Prank M. King:, of
Tucson, Arizona, as the majority
stockholders and the men who
manage the project.
Within a few years the com
pany hopes to enlarge its hold
ings to 100,000 acres, comprising
four entire townships. The lands
are located near Hiawatha.
Included in the land now own
ed by the company is 20,000
acres of marsh lands, which will
produce thousands of tons of
hay suitable for winter feed.
No hay has been harvested this
year, as Mr. King and Mr.Canon
intend to devote all their time to
the task of building forty miles
of fence which will surround
their lands.
Messrs. Canon and King had
previously investigated the pos
sibilities of the country, but
when they arrived and went into
the proposition more thoroughly
they decided that there was an
opening for the profitable opera
tion of a bigger outfit than they
felt like financing, so they or
ganized the Cloverland Co.
They have bought 50,000 acres
of land, which includes their
original acreage of 25,000, and
are preparing to fence it, to be
ready for the reception of the
5000 steers which they will place
in pasture on the land early next
spring. l ne tract wnicn tney
will fence is well grassed and
well watered. About half of the
land is marsh or meadow cover
ed with a heavy growth of blue
joint and red top grass the other
half is hardwood upland and has
an abundance of clover, timothy
and blue grass growing on it.
They have seeded a great deal of
blue grass seed on the burnings.
Seven hundred head of Ariz
ona cattle are getting fat on a
small section of this tract, and
will be ready for market this
season.
At least 10,000 tons of hay can
be put up each year on this
ranch, for winter feed. A 15
mile ditch drains the land so
that it is possible to go on the
land with a team and mow the
wild hay.
The tract is seven miles wide,
and thirteen miles long, and
forty miles of fence will enclose
it. Four strands of the heaviest
galvanized barbed wire and
heavy cedar posts will be used.
There are eleven lakes, two
large rivers and ten good-sized
branches, besides numerous
springs on the place, and so dis
tributed that the cattle will have
to go but a short distance in any
direction for water.
TO TRAIN R. R. WORKERS.
Washington. The United
States railroad administration
calls attention of railroad offi
cials to the federal vocational
training law, passed by congress
February 23, 1917. These offi
cials are urged to establish part
time schools for railroad shop
apprentices and others who come
within the scope of the act.
In a circular issued to the rail
road officials it is stated that
"where it is found necessary in
order to facilitate this work,
railroads will be authorized, on
request, to fit up suitable study
or class rooms at the different
shops where such schools may
be held. Where such schools
are established, railroads will be
authorized to pay apprentices at
their usual rate for the time
spent in attending such schools.
Apprentices on roads where such
schools are established will be
required to attend not less than
208 hours per year.

A JOYOUS AFFAIR.
Nogales Chamber of Commerce En
tertain Their Sonora Friends.
The grand ball at the Santa
Cruz Club last Thursday even
inp; given by the Nogales, Ariz
ona Chamber of Commerce, in
honor of the Camara de Comer
cio of Nogales, Sonora, was a
joyous affair, being a success in
every way. Hundreds of mem
bers of the two civic organiza
tions, accompanied by their
ladies, were in attendance, and
everything possible was done to
make the grand ball one long
pleasantly remembered by all.

RENDERING PLANT BUSY.
OF INTEREST TO SHIPPERS.
Packing Company Will Purchase Many
Burros, Horses and Mules.
Relief for Calif ornia fruit ship
pers and lumber men is seen in
the announcement recently of
District Director William Sproule
in behalf of the United States
Railroad Administration that,
effective, October 20, all roads
under Federal control would
levy storage charges of ten dol
lars per day on refrigerator cars
not unloaded after five days
from which free time begins, and
a similar charge on cars of lum
ber held for reconsignment after
forty eight hours free time.
Both charges are in addition to
the present demurrage rates.
The new tariff has been filed
by J. E. Fairbanks, general sec
retary and treasurer of the Am
erican Railroad Association, in
behalf of all roads and under au
thority of the Interstate Com
merce Commission.
Following close upon the ap
pointment of Terminal Car Ser
vice Committees at all important
centers, this latest step to secure
prompt release of equipment and
speed up car supply is expected
to greatly facilitate the adminis
tration's efforts to supply the
needs of the shipping public.
One of the main difficulties the
California fruit shippers have
had to contend with in the pre
sent car shortage has been delay
in unloading cars at Eastern
points. Hundreds of cars, badly
needed in the West, have been
held in storage by brokers and
receivers. The same .thing to a
lesser extent has handicapped
Western lumbermen.
The newly levied penalties on
using cars for storage purposes
constitute a drastic effort to re
lease the car supply and meet
conditions brought about by ab
normal crops.

Another huge niche was carv
ed in the business annals of No
gales today when the plant of
the Arizona Packing Company
was set in operation at Nogal
itos, says Thursday's Herald.
Twelve butchers were engaged
in killing old mares, burros and
broken down horses for the ren
dering vats and the machinery
installed by J. W. Wilkey, the
well known mechanical engi
neer, worked smoothly.
A. J. W. Born, superintendent
of the plant, and W. D. Timm
who is field agent for the com
pany were pleased at the work
consummated today, 50 animals
being slaughtered. It is the in
tention of the management to
slaughter on an average of 125
animals a day, when the help
becomes more proficient in their
duties.
The plant which is a model of
neatness and sanitary in every
respect consists of two buildings
containing boilers for the gen
eration of steam used in the
digestor or rendering vats and
the main operating room. The
main operating room consists of
immense rendering vats, a press
and two drying drums. In all,
the new organization has spent
the sum of $50,000 in installing
the plant.
In addition to being a valuable
acquisition to the business en
terprises of Nogales, the new
plant is of unlimited worth to
the cattlemen of Arizona.
Thousands of wild horses, bur
ros and old mares now roaming
the ranges, eating feed needed
by cattle; running the fat off
cattle, drinking water holes dry
and tearing up the ranges with
their sharp hoofs will be slaught
ered for the rendering vats, the
removal of the worthless stock
being of great benefit to the
stock men.
It is estimated that one old
broom tail mare eats up the feed
of three steers, so the immense
value of the plant to the com
munity, can be realized. At the
present time, contracts calling
for 100,000 head of old mares,
burros and horses have been
placedy by the company, the
ranges being scoured from the
northern end of the state to the
Mexican line.
In addition to Mr. Timm and
Mr. Born, who are in active
charge here, Robert Cords, Jr.,
of San Francisco, and W. R.
Madden, a well known banker
of Dixon, California, are inter
ested in the project.
Advices from Patagonia, re
ceived late yesterday evening,
state that. Mrs. Jesse L. Gatlin
died in that place yesterday
evening and will be buried there
this afternoon, says Wednes
day's Oasis.
Deceased, whose maiden name
was Susie Jones, was a daught
er of Mr. and Mrs. J. I. Jones,
of Parker Canon, and she was
28 years of age. Besides her
sorrowing husband, she leaves
to mourn her loss two children,
a son, Lloyd Gatlin, aged 9
years, and a little daughter,
Jessie Gatlin, aged 3 years.
In their affliction the afflicted
family have the sincere sym
pathy of the entire countryside.
L. R. Hand ley, representing
the Mine and Smelting Company
of El Paso, has been a Nogales
visitor this week, in the interest
of his big supply house.

Life
Was a
Misery
Mrs. F. M. Jones, of
Palmer, Okla., writes:
"From the time 1 en
tered into womanhood
... 1 looked with dread
from one month to the
next. I suffered with my
back and bearing-down
pain, until life to me was
a misery. I would think
I could not endure the
pain any longer, and I
gradually got worse. . .
Nothing seemed to help
me until, one day, . .

The Woman's Tonic
' I took four bottles,"
Mrs. Jones goes on to
say, "and was not only
greatly relieved, but can
truthfully say that 1 have
not a pain. . .
" It has now been two
years since I tookCardui,
and I am still in good
health. . . I would ad
vise any woman or girl
to use Cardui who is a
sufferer from any female
trouble."
If you suffer pain caused
from womanly trouble, or
if you feel the need of a
good strengthening tonic
to build up your run-down
system, take the advice
of Mrs. Jones. Try Car
dui. It helped her. We
believe it will help you.
