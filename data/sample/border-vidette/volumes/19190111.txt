merely as customers but as friends.
People purchase here because they
have friendly feeling for this 9tore.
The cause which develops this friendly
feeling, may differ, in fact, they are

values; another's is the result of effi
cient service and courteous treatment,
and so on.
Naturally this friendshiply feeling on
the part of our patrons is reciprocated
on our part. And this spirit of mutual
friendship is an impetus for greater
service and an incentive to ever-increasing
endeavor to make this store
a place where every visitor will feel
perfectly at home.

It may be that the fight to
make the world safe for Demo

thing sure, is that the war will
not be Over until Bolshevism is
driven completely out of the

Mr. Louis B. Witney, recently
chairman of the commission of

Senator Henry F. Jhurst of
Arizona has introduced a resolu

open negotiatious for the pur
chase from Mexico by the United

north of 31 , degrees lititude in
the state of Sonora.
Cattlemen of Cochise county,
who because of the prolonged
drouth had been feeling dispirit
ed over the outlook for next
year, are beginning to take heart
and express optimistic views re
garding the spring season. The
snowfalls of the last few weeks
which have been far heavier
in the mountains than in the
valley, have caused this change
of heart.
The claim which the Thiel
Detective Agency of Los An
geles had filed against Yavapai
county and which later led to a
suit being instituted against the
supervisors following their re
fusal to pay the amount demand
ed by the sleuth firm, was set
tled by stipulation, the county
confessing judgment in the sum
of ?1,722 34, this amount being
$41.0 less than the amount origi

The Egyptian government has
filed an application with Dr. R.
B. von KleinSmid, president of
the University of Arizona, for
an expert date culturist from
the University staff. This is in
line with the recently adopted
policy of the authorities of
Egypt to bring to the assistance
of the agriculturists of that
country the experience of the
experts of dry farming which
are developed by the University
of Arizona.
There has been some confus
ion and controversy as to whe
ther or not the anti gambling
law approved in November is
November is yet in effect as law.
The secretary of state gives the
information that all the laws
adopted at the November elec
tion were put into full force and
effect by proclamation of the
governor on December 5. Also
that these laws carried the pro
viso that they were to be so put
into effect.
Late advices from Washing
ton indicate that no second fed
eral judge for the Arizona dis
trict is likely to be designated
for several years to come. The
bill now past the house and in
the senate is under a rule of
unanimous consent, hardly like
ly to be given. There is remem
brance among the Republican
senators of the action of Sena
tors Ashurst and Smith in hold
ing up appointment of Judge
Sloan to the Arizona federal
judgship until after the seating
of a democratic president, and
so politics again may enter into
the matter. Judge Sawtelle has
been to Washington to tell the
senators of the over loaded con

docket which has become the
more congested through a long
adjournment due to inlluenza

OUR RETURNING SOLDIERS.
Our soldiers and sailors are re
turning by the thousand. They
left homes and jobs to risk their
lives upon the field of battle.
That so many of them have been
spared to return is a blessing
and an occasion for joy. Yet if
this return is not to be fraught
with danger to themselves and
to their country, they must be
not only welcomed but must be
absorbed without delay into in
dustrial life.
There is mischief and discon
tent in idleness. Recognizing
these facts, the government has
established the United States
Employment Service, which with
the cooperation of national wel
fare institutions and local com
munity organizations of all kinds,
aims to take the returning sol
dier and sailor and the war
worker thrown out of employ
ment by changing conditions,
and put them in touch with the
jobs that need them and for
which they are fitted.
It is the intention to link na
tional and local efforts in one
great chain, and to prov'de a
bureau in each community where
information may be given and
obtained as to industrial open
ings throughout the country.
Qualified men are also stationed
at ail the army camps to ac
quaint the soldiers and sailors
with the facilities offered for
their use.
All the returning soldier or
sailor has to do is to apply at
the local bureau and he will be
given all available information
and aided to find a job.
Labor conditions throughout
the country are reported en
couraging. There are at pres
ent many opportunities and a
very small percentage of places
report any labor surplus.
This great employment ser
vice, which can put the employ
ers in touch from Maine to Cal
ifornia, and wiil do it without
charge, is one of the most useful
public institutions of our day.
GIVE MINERS A SQUARE DEAL.
Now that the war is over,
many restrictions on mining de
velopment should be removed.
Owing to government orders,
large producers were restricted
and many small producers sus
pended entirely.
Restrictions were necessary in
order to win the war, and the
mining industry responded with
superb patriotism.
Thousands of skilled men and
mining engineers were taken out
of development work and sent
to the front to help win the war.
Thousands of mines suspend
ed production and development
work to meet the government's
demand for man power. These
mines suspended financial oper
ation and closed up their prop
erties until after the war and
put tbir money into the war.
All restrictions hindering le
gitimate development should
now be removed and let the
work of opening new mines go
ahead. Patagonian.
As four members of the board

THE SANTA CRUZ CLUB.
President Gusietler Says the Organiz
ation Needs Financial Aid.
The Santa Cruz Clab has been
in existence for the past ten
years and it seems hardly ne
cessary to renifnd the residents
of Nogales that t he c.'ub has
filled a long felt want in the so
cial and business life of this
.-community. Whenever there lias
arrived any distinguished per
son whom the citizens of this
town desired to entertain in the
best of fashion, the only logical
place where this could be done
by the community as a whole,
was at tha Santa Cruz club. To
each of these occasions, the en
tire community was invited to
participate regardless as to whe
ther they were members or not.
During the period of the war
many of our members have been
away in the service of their
country, and other more import
ant matters of necessity dis
placed the activity that formerly
belonged to the Santa Cruz club.
This was as it should have been,
and the Santa Cruz elub is proud
of the fact that its members did
everything that could have beeu
expected of them. However,
this caused a considerable in
debtedness to our club and one
which we now must seek to wipe
out in order that the club may
again take its place as the na
tural community reception par
lor to its distinguished visitors;
not only this, but a community
of the size which
Noirales has - r
now attained, must have its so
cial recreations and the club is
the only and natural place where
that can be obtained. A com
munity whore nothing but busi
ness is the chief and only pur
suit of its people, would not be
a very healthy nor agreeable
community to live in.
Some eight months ago the
Santa Cruz clab, with the idea
of bringing to this town, talent
ed entertainers, entered into a
contract with the Redpath Ly
ceum Course to bring various
beneficial entertainers to this
town. To do this, the Santa
Cruz club must meet this obliga
tion and this can only be done
if every citizen who has been
directly or indirectly benefitted
by the Santa Cruz club will do
their part in purchasing season
tickets and also aid in selling
them. The price of the season
ticket is only $2.50 for adults,
and $1.00 for children under fif
teen years of age. This includes
the entire course which will be
brought here, and is well worth
the amouut asked. Ia othev
towns, to see entertainments of
like character, the same would
cost at least $1.50 admission for
a single performance.
The Santa Cruz club needs
your financial assistance in this
matter, and we ask the coopera
tion of every one who loves the
town he lives in.

A. L.. Gustetter, President.

pa rati vol. v easy to bring about conser
vation of staple necessities, but that It
rrould be fr more difficult to accom
plish an actual decrense in the use of
luxuries. The doubters took sugar as
an example, and declared that it would
be practically Impossible to bring our
consumption of sugar down to a point
that would meet only the food ueeds
of the people.
Now that demands upon ocean ton
nage will be lightened, European na
tions will be able to go farther afield
for foodstuffs, and will no longer bo
entirely dependent for sugar upon
North American supplies. Willi the
stocks now in prospect, we will have
sufficient sugar to place this country
back upon normal consumption if the
present short rations In Europe are
not materially increased. If the Eu
ropean ration is to be materially In
creased over the present low amount
It can be only through (he American
people's making it possible by con
tinued restriction to a greater or lesa
extent here.
The fact that the Food Administra
tion has been able to relax the volun
tary sugar ration Is in itself proof that
the ration of two pounds per person
per month was generally observed
throughout the country. This conser
vation allowed the Food Administra
tion to build up a reserve, and to tide
over the period of scarcity, until the
the new crops of Louisiana cane and
beet sugar were ready for distribution.
The records of the Food Adminis
tration show that In July, August, Sep
tember and October 195,000 tons were
distributed. Normal consumption for
that period is 1,600,000 tons. This
shows a definite, concrete saving of
over 500,000 tons. These figures ap
ply to sugar consumed on the table, in
the kitchen and In the various indus
tries, and show conclusively that in
the homes and public eating places of
America, where TO per cent, of all our
sugar is consumed, the sugar consump
tion 1ms been reduced by more than
one-third.
In the four-month period begin
ning with July, this country normally
uses 400,000 tons of sugar per month.
Last July 200,000 tons entered Into
distribution. In August only 225,000
tons were distributed. In September
the figures showed 279,000 tons, and
then fell to 230,000 tons in October.
There could be no more definite
proof thnt the American people have
given their loyal co-operation and sup
port of the war.

AN AMERICAN HABIT
THAT WAS EXPANDED.
Coming to the relief of the dis
tressed Is not a new sensation to us.
Having sent shiploads of food to the
famine sufferers of India as offhand
edly as the housewife hands out a cut
of the loaf to the wayfarer. It seemed
the most natural thing in the world to
succor Belgium, to take on the feeding
of a nation quite informally.
The test of peace Is to summon for
the healing of nations devotion equal
to that given the tasks of war.

METHODS OF DEMOCRACY.
The extent to which the United
States Food Administrator has
relied on the voluntary support
of the American people is shown
by a statement made by the
United States Pood Administra
tor speaking before the Senate
Agricultural Committee less
than three months after this
country entered the war. That
he was Justified In his implicit
confidence in the Rtrength of de
mocracy has been clearly reflect
ed by the measure of support we
have lent the Allies.
"If democracy Is worth any
thing," Mr. Hoover declared, "we
can do these things by co-operation,
by stimulation, by self-sacrifice,
by the patriotic mobiliza
tion of the bralr.3 of this coun
try. If it cannot be done in this
manner It is better that we ac
cept German domination and
confess to failure of our political
ideals, acquiesce in the superior
ity of the German conception
and send for the Germans to In
struct us In Its use."

treated rue... but I got no better. I
got worse and worse until" the misery
was unbearable ... I wa3 in bed for
three; months and suffered such agony
that I was Just drawn up in a knot. . .
I told my husband if he would get
me a bottle of Cardul I would try It. . .
I commenced taking it, however, that
evening I called my family about
me... for I knew I could not last
many days unft;ss I had a change for J
the better. That was afx rears a
and I em still here aad am a welL
strong woman, and I owe my life to
Cardul. I had only taken half the
bottle when I began to feel better.
The misery In my side got lees... 1
continued right on taking the Caretat
until I had taken three bottlea sad I
did not naed any more for I waa well
and never felt better la my life... f

give Cardui, the woman's tonic, a
