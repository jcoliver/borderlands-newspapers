PRESIDENT ASKS FOR WAR.
United States Accepts Challenge of
German Government.
Washington, April 2. Presi
dent Wilson tonight urged con
gress assembled in joint session
to declare a state of war exist
ing between the United States
and Germany.
In a dispassionate, but un
measured denunciation of the
course of the imperial' German
government, which he charac
terized as a challenge to all
mankind and a warfare against
nations, the president said that
neutrality no longer was feasi
ble or desirable where the peace
of the world was involved, that
armed neutrality had become
inefficient and was likely to
produce what it was meant to
prevent, and urged that con
gress accept the guage of battle,
with all the resources of the na
tion. "I advise that the congress
declare the recent course of the
imperial German government to
be in fact nothing less than war
against the government and
people of the United States,"
said the president; 'that it for
mally accept the status of bel
ligerent which has thus been
thrust upon it and that it take
steps not only to put the country
in a more thorough state of de
fense, but also to exert all its
power and employ all its re
sources to bring the government
of the German empire to terms
and end the war."
When the president had finish
ed speaking, resolutions to de
clare a state of war exists, were
introduced in both houses, re
ferred to appropriate committees,
and will be debated tomorrow.
There is no doubt of their pas
sage. -
The objects of the United
States in entering tfie war, the
president said, are to vindicate
the principles of peace and
justice against selfish and auto
cratic power.
vv i thou t selfish ends, for con
quest or dominion, seeking no
indemnities, or material com
pensations for the sacrifices it
shall make, the United States
must enter the war, he said to
make the world safe for demo
cracy, as only one of the cham
pions of the rights of mankind,
and would be satisfied when
these rights were as secure as
the faith and freedom of nations
could make them.
The president's address was
sent in full to Germany by a
German official news agency for
publication in that country. The
text also went to England, and a
summary of its contents was
sent to other nations.
To carry on effective warfare
against the German government,
which he characterized as a ua
tural foe, the president recom
mended. Utmost practicable co-operation
in counsel and action with
the governments already at war
with Germany.
Extension of liberal financial
credits to those governments
so that the resources of America
may be added to theirs.
Organization and mobilization
of all the material resources of
the country.
Pull equipment of the navy,
particularly for means of dealing
with submarine warfare.
An army of at least 500,000
based on the principle of univ
ersal liability of service and ad
ditional increments of 500,000
each as they are needed or can
be handled in training.
Raising necessary money for
the United States government so
far as possible without borrow
ing and on the basis of equitable
taxation.
All preparations, the president
urged, should be made in such a
way as not to check the flow of
war supplies to the nations al
ready in the field against Ger
many. Measures to accomplish all
these ends, the president told
congress, would be presented
with the best thought of the ex
ecutive departments which will
be charged with the conduct of
war, and he besought considera
tion for them in that light.
President Wilson's appearance
before congress was marked by
a great demonstration. Crowds
on the outside of the capitol
cheered btm frantically as he
entered and as he left. Congress
roared and cheer after cheer in
an outburst of patriotic enthu
siasm. From the galleries the only
members who appeared not to
be joining in the demonstration
were some senators of the group
whom he branded as "wilful
members who, by preventing a
vote On the armed neutrality bill,
had made the government of the
united States contemptiable."
Disclaiming any quarrel with
the German people and anything
but a feeling of friendship and
sympathy for them, the presi
dent declared their govern
ment had not acted upon their
impulses in entering the war nor
with their knowledge or ap
proval. '
It was evident, the president
added, that spies were here even
before the war began. That
the German government means
to stir up enemies at the very
door of the United States was
shown, by the revelation of the
plot to embroil Japan and Mex
ico in a war with the United
States.
Toward Germany's allies, the
president said the United States
would take no action at this
time because they were not en
gaged in -warfare against the
United States on the high seas.
The United States, he said,
was moving only against a gov
ernment which has thrown aside
all considerations of humanity
and of right and is "running
amuck."
The president expressed his
confidence in the loyalty of the
naturalized citizens and declared
if disloyalty dared raise its head
it would be only from "a lawless
and malignant few" and sternly
would be suppressed.
With a renewed declaration
that the nation must unselfishly
act, only for freedom, peace and
humanity, the president left the
questions with congress.
In closing the President said:
"It is a distressing and op
pressive duty, gentlemen of the
congress, which I have perform
ed in thus addressing you. There
may be many months of fiery
trial and sacrifice ahead of us.
It is a fearful thing to lead this
great peaceful country into war,
in to the most terrible and disa
strous of all wars, civilization
itself seeming to be in the bal
ance. But the right is more
precious than peace, and we
shall fight for the things which
we have always carried nearest
our hearts for democracy, for
the rights of those who submit
to authority to have a voice in
their own governments, for the
rights and liberties of small na
tions, for a universal dominion
of right by such a concert of free
peoples as shall bring peace and
safety to all nations and make
the world itself at last free. To
such a task we can dedicate our
lives and our fortunes, every
thing that we have with the
pride of those who know that the
day has come when America is
privileged to spend her blood
and her might for the principles
that gave her birth and happi
ness and the peace which she
has treasured.
"God helping her, she can do
no other."
While the president was speak
ing, word of the torpedoing
without warning of the Amer
ican steamer Aztec, the first
American ship to be attacked in
the barred zone, was passed
from mouth to mouth but the
president did not know of it until
he had finished.
While congress works tomor
row on the war resolution, the
cabinet will hold a war session
to which Major General Scott,
chief of staff of the army, and
Admiral Benson, chief of opera
tions of the navy may be invited.
The nation is on a war footiner
and now is only girding itself to!
take up the gauntlet that has
been so ruthlessly thrown down.
UNITED STATES AT WAR.
Washington, D. C, April 3
The United States really is at
war with the German empire
today, awaiting only the formal
recognition of congress. Every
agency was moving to gird the
nation against the government,
which President Wilson in his
address to congress characteriz
ed as "a natural foe to liberty."
The cabinet, at a war session,
was called to discuss the exten
sion of credits to the nations al
ready at war against Germany;
the raising of money by taxation
for use of the United States in
the war; the equipment of the
navy to the fullest state of ef
ficiency tp cope with the sub
marine than ace and the raising
of a great army on the principle
of universal liability to service
the first increment of which is to
be 500,000 men.
The council of national defense
and its advisory cammittee. in a
joint session, continued the work
of mobilization of the national
resources to "bring the govern
ment of the German empire to
terms and end the war," as the
president expressed it.
The war department and the
army general staff was ready to
present to congress its plans
for raising an army just as soon
as the legislative body asks for
it.
Work in congress on the reso
lution to formally declare a state
of war existing went rapidly for
ward. The senate foreign rela
tions committee approved as in
troduced, without change iu its
effect.
The resolution as approved
now is as follows: f ,
"Whereas, the imperial Ger
man government has committed
repeated acts of war against the
government and the people of
the United States of America;
therefore be it
"Resolved by the senate and
house of representatives of the
United States of America, in
congress assembled, that the
state of war existing between
the United States and the impe
rial German government, which
has thus-been thrust upon the
United States, is hereby formal
ly declared; and that the presi
dent be and he is hereby author
ized and directed to employ the
entire naval and military forces
of the United States and the re
sources of the government to
carry on wargainst the impe
rial government of Germany and
to bring to conflict to a success
ful termination, all of the re
sources of the country are nere
by pledged by the congress of
the United States."
Turkey Ranching Success In Arizona.
Turkey ranching is a new in
dustry born of the decreasing
production of turkeys on farms,
according to an article in the re
cently published 1910 Yearbook
of the United States Depart
ment of Agriculture.
Exclusive turkey ranching is
now found practically only in
the unsettled foothill regions of
California and in certain sections
of Arizona and other western
states. In these regions a few
persons are engaged in raising
a thousand or more turkeys a
season. The establishments
are located where the range is
unlimited and the natural food of
the turkeys, such as grasshop
pers and other insects, greeji
vegetation, and the seeds of
various weeds and grasses, is
abundant. Advantage also is
taken on these ranches of the
turkey's relish for acorns, and
where these are plentiful but
little grain need be used for
fattening in the fall.
The large flocks of turkeys
are managed much like herds of
sheep, being taken out to the
range early in the morning and
brought home to roost at night.
They are herded during the day
by men either on" foot or on
horseback, and by dogs especial
ly trained for the work.
Navajo county taxpayers will
On April 24 vote on the question,
of issuing road bonds in the
amount of $160,000. The money
derived from the sale of the
bonds, in case the issue is approv
ed, will be spent largely in build
ing roads to connect with govern
ment roads on the Wbiteriver
Indian reservation or in the
Sitgreaves national forest.
ARIZONA NOTES.
Items of Interest Culled From Oui
Exchanges.
The Old Dominion Copper
company is producing copper at
the rate of somewhat over 3,000,
000 per month, including the cop
per from flotation concentrates
which is shipped to the Interna
tional smelter.
The deal which has been pend
ing for several weeks over the
taking over of the old Mowry
mine, near Patacronia.. nnn nf
the most famous old mines in the
entire Southwest by the Standard
Metals Co., has been completed
this week. Work is to start up
at once. Churn drills will be
used in exploration work.
Federal aid in the amount of
$60,000 has been requested by
the state board of control to
hasten the repair of the bridge
over the Gila river at Florence.
The legislature recently appro
priated $50,000 for extending the
bridge over the river, and with
$60,000 from the government it
is believed a sufficient sum will
be available to insure the com
pletion of a bridge twice as loner
as the present sturcture. The
bridge has been rendered useless
by reason of the river washing a
new channel during the floods
of 1916.
Frank S. Jackson, formerly a
printer on the Daily Miner and
well known in Kingman and
Prescott, has discovered a copper-gold
mine in the Parker
country, Yuma county. He left
several months ago on a pros
pecting trip and had not been
heard from until he arrived in
Parker recently with samples of
rich copper ore from a find made
north of the Parker reservation.
Mr. Jackson is associated with
Phoenix people in the claims
and it is expected that, their de
velopment will begin before the
warm weather puts a stop ac
tive outdoor work in that region.
The British statesmen are
applying themselves to agricul
ture. They see themselves
made a self-supporting nation,
to a large extent, as the result
of this war. They are going to
plow up all their lands and crop
them to the end that they may
have enough to eat, if the tight
little island should be surround
ed with submarines. To begin
with they are going to use 2000
tractor plows, equipped with
headlights so they can plow at
night as well as by day time.
That is a new idea and it may
become popular the world over,
for it may enable the farmers to
do their work in the cool of the
nights instead of in the heat of
the days. Mohave County'

NOGALES RIFLE CLUB.
Last Thursday night, at the

urges citizens of citizen to at
tend worship tomorrow and offer

Whereas, the President, in his
wisdom and with the concurrence
of congress, has declared that a
state of Wo, r exists between the
United States .nd empire of

Whereas, it is desirable and
fitting that the citizens of the

in a public manner, their alle
giance and fealty to the Union,
and reconsecrate themselves,
their families, their possessions,
and, if need be, their lives at the
altar of their country.
Now therefore, in pursuance
of this, our bounden duty, I,
Thomas E. Campbell, governor
of Arizona, hereby designate
Sunday April 8, 1917, as "Loy
alty Sunday" and urgently re
commend that on the day thus

common welfare as a nation.
In witness whereof, I have
hereunto set my hand and caus
ed the great seal of the State of
Arizona to be affixed.
Done at Phoenix, the capital,
this 3rd day of April, A. D., 1917.

ARIZONA IS LOYAL.
In a recent statement to the
Arizona press, Governor Thomas
E. Campbell, voicing the senti
ment of all citizens of the state,
said:
"The declaration of war against
Germany was not unlooked for
we have as a matter of fact,
been in a state of war for the
past several weeks, awaiting
only the action of congress, who
alone has the authority to de
clare war with other countries.
I deeply deplore the break with
Germany and had hoped that
the great European conflict
might have ended without our
participating therein, but this
could not be and allow us as a
people to retain our self respect
and live up to the ideals we have
created as a nation the cham
pion of liberty and the protector
of oppressed humanity. My
hopes and prayers will now be
for a speedy termination of this
awful conflict with our own coun
try taking such a part as will
preserve and perpetuate Amer
ican liberty in the highest con
ception. I am sure of Arizona
she will do her part, worthily
and well. Already men in every
walk in life from the highest to
the humblest have tendered their
services to their country s call
and we are already prepared to
enlist and rocruit a number of
volunteers several times our
quota of the president's call for
500,000. The copper production
of the state has been offered to
the government at a greatly re
duced price from the present
market. Our other resources
will be likewise tendered if the
necessity arises. There is not a
doubt in my mind but that the
whole people of Arizona will
stand squarely back of the pre
sident and congress in their ac
tion and declarations and will
ingly and patriotically submerge
their private and personal in
terests to the benefit of our com
mon welfare. Let every true
Arizonan join hands this very
day and with shoulder to should
er, without distinction as to
class, creed or nativity, work
together to the end that all
humanity might be benefitted and
a nearer approach be gained to
ward the universal brotherhood
of man."

TUNGSTEN IS "KEY METAL."
The National City Bank of
New York, has called attention
to the importance of tungsten
as a key material in a pamphlet
mailed throughout the country.
Tungsten is the necessary
element in "high speed" steel
tools. There are several other
rare metals with practically the
same properties, but they hardly
count in practice. America gave
the world "high speed" steel,
the tungsten steel, which retains
its temper and edge even when
it becomes red hot through rapid
cutting into the carbon steel
which it is machining. By
means of it a lathe and a work
man can de many times the
amount of work that could be
done with the hardest tools of
ordinary metal.
It is a very important mate
rial. It is running short even
in -England now, and Sheffield
workmen are searching for it
when they leave their machines
after the day's work is done.
Tungsten steel is going higher
in price.
Tungsten is, therefore, an ab
solutely essential "key" mate
rial in modern manufacture. A
nation that can shut a competi
tor nation out of its supply of
tungsten can perhaps shut it
out of markets through forcing
up its manufacturing costs.
Tungsten might also win or
lose a war between countries
producing their own munitions.
BIG PRICE FOR STEERS.
f. W. Brown and J. P. Robert
son, cattle buyers of El Paso,
accompanied by Prank M. King
the Tucson cattle broker, were
in the Patagonia country this
week buying cattle, signing con
tracts for early June delivery at
$32, $37 and $12. About 1000
head were secured. The price,
$32 for yearlings, is slightly
higher than that paid last year
in this community, although few
if any deliveries were made in
the spring and in the fall these
prices prevailed.
Cattlemen are feeling relieved
now that warmer weather has
at last arrived. The cold weath
er and especially the freezing
nights, held back the grass, and
while no great suffering of stock
was reported, considerable anx
iety was felt. In some places a
few cattle were reported to be
dying. With the coming of
warmer weather, and the con
sequent springing up of better
nourishment, it is believed cattle
will pull thrpugh until rains
come. If the usual spring show
ers come and oldtimers in
this part of the state say they
never fail in the month of April
cattlemen should have the best
year they have ever experienced.
Among the Patagonia cattle
growers who signed contracts
for June delivery to Messrs.
Brown and Rebertson were: Jas.
Parker Sr., Geo. W. and Duke
Parker, J. S. Gatlin, Albert,
Jesse and Jas. L. Gatlin, Ernest
Best, Clyde McPherson, J. I.
Jones, B. Lewis and Pete Ber
ier. Patagonian.

just once. You put 2 or 3 drops on,
and it diies at once. There's noth
ing to stick. You can put your shoe
and stocking right on again. The
pain is all gone. Then the corn
dies a painless, shriveling death. It
loosens from your toe, and off it
comes. "Gets-lt" is the biggest sell
ing corn remedy in the world today.
There's none other as good.
"Gets-It" is sold by druggists
everywhere, 25c a. bottle, or sent on
receipt of price by E. Lawrence & Co.,
Chicago, ill.
Sold in Nogalea and recommended

It Always Helps
says Mrs. Sylvania Woods, of Clifton Mills, Ky., in
writing of her experience with Cardui, the woman's
tonic She says further: "Before 1 began to use
Cardui, my back and head would hurt so bad, I
thought the pain would kill me. I was hardly able
to do any of my housework. After taking three bottles
of Cardui, 1 began to feel like a new woman. I soon
gained 35 pounds, and now, I do all my housework,
as well as run a big water mill.
1 wish every suffering woman would give
The Woman's Tonic
a trial. I still use Cardui when I feel a little bad,
and it always does me good."
Headache, backache, side ache, nervousness,
tired, worn-out feelings, etc., are sure signs of woman
ly trouble. Signs that you need Cardui, the votnan's
tonic. You cannot make a mistake in trying Cardui
for your trouble. It has been helping weak, ailing
women for more than fifty years.
