Every day that passes brings
new proofs that President Wil
sen was right when he told the
Senate that there can be no es
cape from the effects of the war
until the United States filed its
acceptance of the terms of peace
with Germany; that is, until the
treaty ceases to be a mere me
morandum of an agreement and
becomes a binding contract.
J. W. Puquay of Gadsden was
in Yuma yesterday. He made
the statement that he had just
begun to pick his cotton crop
and that from the first picking
on an acre of ground he had
secured 1,800 pounds of seed
cotton. This would indicate that
he would get a total yield from
this crop of two bales to the
acre. With such crops and the
present price it is no wonder
that these valley farmers can
spend their summers on the
coast, coming home just in time
to bank the money from their
cotton crops. Yuma Sun.
Senator Mulford Winsor is bet
ter known as a politician and as
a prospective candidate for Gov
ernor than as a farmer." How
ever, farming is his delight. He
may grow some political thistles
at times but he is a real-farmer
and from the soil he draws the
sustenance with which he plays
the political game. He owns his
original homestead in Yuma
valley, 160 acres of the finest
land, worth $50,000 or more.
This ranch is in a high state of
cultivation. He also owns 320
acres near Gadsden, also under
cultivation. He owns land on
the Mesa, in the south Gila val
ley and up the Gila river. In
fact Mr. Winsor is one of Yuma's
big land owners and his farming
activities are very profitable.

THE JUNKERS OF THE SENATE
"The American people will
have to pay for the windows
broken by Senator Lodge and
his frienzied partisan associates
on the Committee on Foreign
Relations. They may as well
make up their minds to that first
as last," says the New York
World.
Continuing, the World says:
"It is not possible for a part of
the treaty making power of the
United States wantonly to insult
government after government
and nation after nation without
working irreparable mischief to
all the foreign relations of this
country. While all Americans
know that Lodge and his asso
ciates are merely playing poli
tics against the President, we
have no right to expect other
people to dismiss this sabre
rattling as merely one of the
hypocritical eccentricities of the
American system of govern
ment. "The world has a right to de
mand that the United States
Senate, being clothed with the
authority to ratify treaties, shall
be a responsible body and shall
not prostitute its power in for
eign affairs to ignoble partisan
uses.
"The course that Senator
liodge and a majority of the
committee have chartered is one
of complete irresponsibility.
"Nothing matters to them ex
cept the defeat of the Presi
dent, and no disaster of which
the human imagination can con
ceive is too heavy a price to pay
for that.
"Unless they aie brought to
their senses by the American
people, who will be the ultimate
Victims of this iasane policy of
malice and meanness, there is
an excellent chance not only that
the United States will come out
of the war with the open hos
tility of the great nations of the
world, but that there will be an
actual coalition against us. That
is what the Lodges are inviting.
"The Shantung affair is only
one case in point. Granting the
substantial justice of the Chinese
demands, the fact remains that
it was Japan, not China, which
ousted Germany from Shantung
at a time when this assistance
was invaluable to the Allied
cause. Japan had promised to
restore to China everything ex
cept the German railway and
mining concessions, and the
League of Nations provides a
tribunal under which these
pledges can be enforced. Tbe
action taken by the Senate com
mittee admittedly provides no
relief to China. It was not taken
to provide relief. The Chinese
case was used only as a means
of muddling the treaty and in
creasing the difficulties of the
situation with which President
Wilson must deal.
"If there is any difference be
tween the spirit of the German
Junkers and the spirit of Henry
Cabot Lodge and his nine Re
publican associates, we should
like to know what it is. Both
were ready to plunge the world
into war to gain their place in
the sun and both were equally
contemptuous of the conse
quences. With civilization still
in political turmoil and in a state
of economic chaos, these Sena
tors calmly create new causes of
dissection and seek to make a
final settlement impossible ex
cept by a new appeal to arms.
"Junkertum in Berlin is bad
enough, but Junkertum in the
United States Senate is intolerable."

MOTOR VEHICLE LAW.
Three New Amendments Are Added
to Law, Effective June 12, 1919.
THE Bordkii Vidette has re
ceived a letter from Secretary of
State Simms, enclosing a pam
phlet containing the amendments
to the Motor Vehicle Law, pass
ed by the recent session of the
legislature and which went into
effect June 12, 1919.
The three amendments are
given here, as follows:
Chapter 62 (Sub Senate Bill
134 ) This amendment provides
that before the Secretary of State
can issue a license and deliver
number plates to any person,
firm or corporation in the State
of Arizona, they must have a
certificate from their county as
sessor, stating that the personal
property tax on their motor
vehicle has been paid for the
current year, or is secured by
real estate in their county.
Chapter 156 (Senate Bill 171).
This amendment provides that
persons driving automobiles or
auto trucks on any State high
way must use the full arm signal
to indicate whether they are
turning to the left or right. On
enclosed motor cars, an automa
tic signal must be used when it
is not possible to use the arm.
Chapter 172 (House Bill No.
148). This amendment divides
the license year into quarterly
periods, so that a person apply
ing for license between January
1st and March 31st must pay the
full annual license, and those
applying for a license later in
the year, must pay for the un
expired quarters of the year.
These three amendments were
passed for the better operation
and enforcement of the Motor
Vehicle Law of the Statei The
one requiring the personal prop
erty tax to be paid before a
license can be issued by the Sec
retary of State, is an innovation
and is not generally understood
by the persons applying for
licenses; as a consequence much
delay is caused in issuing licen
ses on account of the length of
time it takes to get the certifi
cate from the assessor.
Each assessor has the certifi
cates in his office, and much time
would be saved if persons who
want motor vehicle licenses
would provide themselves with
such certificates before applying
to the Secretary of Scate for a
motor vehicle license.
Sincerely yours,
Mit Simms,
Secretary of State.
SENATOR WINSOR FOR THE
PEOPLE.
It is the policy of this paper
not to indulge in personalities
and to deal sparingly in its criti
cism of individuals. There are
issues big and important enough
to command our attention.
On the other hand we are more
than glad to command any one
who patriotically devotes his
energies to public service. Un
der this heading we mention
Senator Winsor, whose splendid
ability has often been brought
into play in behalf of the people
of this state.
He has recently returned to
Yuma from Washington, D. C,
where he has been spending
some months in behalf of a large
irrigation project for the Yuma
Mesa. Through Senator Win
sor's efforts Congress has pass
ed the necessary legislation for
the construction of this project.
This means forty or fifty thous
and acres of barren land turned
into farms for thousands of hap
py homes.
This is what you can call con
structive work. This is what
will make a greater Arizona.
In this connection we might
mention another notable achieve
ment of Senator Winsor's. We
refer to the attempt of the Santa
Fe to exchange thousands of
acres of absolutely worthless
land farming and grazing land
in the southern part. When the
Santa Fe was built the govern
ment gave it every other section
of land through which their
right of way ran. An exchange
of thousands of acres of this
land, not worth ten cents an
acre, for valuable land, was
about to be consummated. Mr.
Winsor was on the State Land
Commission. He went to Wash
ington and single handed fought
and won this fight for the people
of this state. The logic and
force of his arguments were so
telling that the Secretary of the
Interior made a ruling against
any future land exchanges of
this nature.
We merely mention these two
incidents to show that while
Senator Winsor has been labor
ing for the upbuilding of Ari
zona, doing those things that
will mean thousands of new citi
zens and increased wealth and
prosperity for this state, his
chief critics have been those
who have been exploiting the
state, taking millions of her
wealth forever from out of her
bounds. Tucson Post.
SIGNS EXTRA -SESSION PLEDGE.
Governor Thos. E. Campbell
has signed the "round robin"
sent by suffrage workers to gov
ernors of all states which have
not yet ratified the federal wo
man suffrage amendments. Tbe
"round robin" is a pledge of the
state executive signing it, to
call a special session of their
legislature to ratify the amend
ment as soon as a sufficient num
ber of other governors have pro
mised to do the same thing. In
other words as soon as ratifica
tion of the federal amendment
has been guaranteed by the sign
ing of the round robin the vari
ous governors pledge themselves
to call their respective legisla
tures in special session.
Governor Campbell is tbe sec
ond governor to have signed the
"round robin," Governor Ste
phens of California being the
first. The Arizona executive has
gone so far as to inquire into
the cost of an extra session of
the legislature lasting one day.
An estimate prepared by the
state auditor places the expense
of one day session at between
$3000 and $4000.

NOGALES-FAI RBAN KS HIGHWAY.
The Santa Cruz Patagonian
says: Messrs. Van Prank and
Montgomery, engineers, under
instructions from Phoenix, have
been at work for sometime on a
state highway from Nogales to
Fairbanks. It seems that the
particular location of the route
is largely up to the engineer in
charge, Mr. Van Prank, his
duty being to find the shortest
route which will enable him to
eliminate as far as possible short
curves and heavy grades.
With these objectives in view,
it is thought the line will lay
via. Patagonia, Sonoita, Hua
chuca, etc., that section between
Patagonia and Sonoita being al
ready practically adopted.
At Nogales this highway will
connect with the Nogales Tucson
highway, and at Fairbanks with
Tombstone, thence to Douglas
or Tucson. Thus when finished
the isolation of the Patagonia
section of country will come to
an end. The highway will also
be of great local value, render
ing Patagonia more easily ac
cessible by farmers, stockmen
and miners.
The U. S. government, it is
thought, will approve the line
now conceived, as it will be of
military value to the govern
ment, Mr. Van Frank hopes to see
men at work on the Patagonia
Sonoita section within a short
time.
George N. Sayre, for many
years connected with the United
States customs service, from
which he resigned last Decem
ber to engage in the cattle busi
ness, was a visitor in the city
last Wednesday from his fine
stock ranch situated west of No
gales about seventy five miles.
George reports plenty of grass
and water in his section and cat

Catarrhal Deafness Cannot Be Cured
by local applications, an thiy cannot reach
the diseased portion of the ear. There
Is only one way to cure catarrhal deafness,
find that Is by a constitutional remedy.
Catarrhal Deafness is caused by an In
flamed condition of the mucous linlnff of
the Eustachian Tube. When this tube is
Inflamed you have a rumbling sound or
Imperfect hearing, and when It is entirely
closed. Deafness is the result. Unless the
Inflammation can be reduced and this tube
restored to Its normal condition, hearing
will be destroyed forever. Many cases of
deafness are caused by catarrh, which Is
an inflamed condition of the mucous sur

tem. We will grlve One Hundred Dollars for
any case of Catarrhal Deafness that cannot

NO STOLEN CATTLE HERE.
M. H. Barr Denies Mexican Stock Have
Been Driven Across Line.
A recent dispatch from Phoenix
says: That there are no stolen
Mexican cattle on the American
side of the line in Nogales-live
stock inspection district, and
that in his opinion Colonel Car
nahan has been misinformed as
to the true situation, is the gist
of a letter received by Ed. W.
Stephen, secretary of the state
livestock sanitary board from
M. H. Barr, the board's inspect
or stationed at Nogales.
Barr's letter is prompted by
published statements that the
board was considering the ad
visability of securing a govern
ment appropriation for the erec
tion of a stock fence all along
the Mexican border from EL
Paso to the Colorado. The sec
retary of the board is now seek
ing to get in touch with cattle
interests to escertain if such a
plan would meet their approval,
and if so it is probable that a
conference will be held at No
gales in the near future.
Barr says that the American
cattlemen are glad to take the
Mexican chiefs around the Am
erican cattle ranges at any time
they may inspect the stock, but
when the plan was suggested
that Americans should have the
same privileges on the Mexican
side they did not favor it.
Barr further reports that the
range from which cattle seem to
be driven away by Mexicans is
now patroled by two county
range riders as well as soldiers.
In addition there is already in
existence a fence 50 to 60 miles
in length, and in the event the
proposed fence is built in the
Papago country, the total fence
line would be still further ex
tended.
Stephens has asked Barr to
make a full report on the situa
tion with reference to alleged
rustling activities, that the same
may be presented incase a hear
ing is ordered.

Six Years Ago, Thinking She Might Die, Says Texas Lady, But I.V.?
She Is a Well, Strong Woman and Praises Cardui For
Her Recovery.
Royse City, Tex. Mrs. Mary Kil
man, of this place, says; "After the
birth of my little girl my side com
menced to hurt me. I had to go back
to bod. "We called the doctor. He
treated me. . .but I got no better. I
got rorse and worse until the misery
wa3 unbearable I was in bed for
.hree montUs and suffered such agony
-hat I was just drawn up in a knot. . .
I told my husband If he would get
ne a bottle of Cardui I would try it. . .
commenced taking it, however, that
;vening I called my family about
ne... lor I r.new I could not last
aay days unfcss I ad a change for
the better. That was six years ago
and I am still here and am a well,
strong woman, and I owe my life to
Cardui. I had' only taken half tha
bottle when I began to feel better.
The misery in my side got less... I
continued right on taking the Cardui
until I had taken thiee bottles and I
did not ned any more for I was well
and never felt better In my life... I
have nevfer had any trouble from that
day to this."
Do you suffer from headache, back
ache, pains in sides, or other discom
forts, each mouth? Or do you feel
weak, nervous and fagged-out? If bo,
give Cardui, the woman's touic, a
trial. J. 71
