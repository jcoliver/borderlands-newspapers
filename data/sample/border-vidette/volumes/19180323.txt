ARIZONA NOTES.
Items of Interest Culled From Our
Exchanges.
Charles Korrick of Phoenix
today is credited with being the
man who caused the Pullman
company to change the German
names of more than 100 of their
sleeping cars to something pure
ly American.
The Eureka mine, in the Sal
ero district, is being operated on
a lease from the Baca Float
heirs, and will be ready soon to
ship ore. The lessees are now
looking for a freighting outfit to
haul the ore to Patagonia.
Lettuce harvest in Salt River
valley continues, Glendale being
the principal shipping point.
This head lettuce is sent out by
the carload to eastern markets.
Already thirty five carloads have
been sent and the entire crop
will reach fifty cars.
More than 100,000 head of
sheep will soon be grazing in
the Sacramento valley of Mo
have county. Heavy rains fol
lowed by warm weather has
made pasture good on that range
and sheepmen from higher al
titudes are going there for
shearing.
Thursday last the Thrift Cam
paign started in earnest in King
man, when Mrs. Mary Eleanor
CoheDour opened her office in
the postoffice and called upon all
patrons of that necessary gov
ernment appurtenance to fulfill
their patriotic duty and buy
Thrift stamps. And they really
bought. Her sales for the day
were $101.50.
Postmaster Francis reports
that the people of Patagonia are
waking up to the advantage of
war savings stamps, and says
the following have invested in
them at the Patagonia postoffice:
Charles W. Coombs, Jr., Louise
Stevens, Mignon Stevens, Geo.
F. Wieland, Helen E. Pattersou,
Allison Gatlin, Lupe Valenzuela
and Alice Ritchie.
The Bland mine is toincorpor
ate immediately, so stock can be
sold for the purpose of raising
money to develop the mine,
which is now in good ore, but
the work cannot be done with
profit until the proper machin
ery has been installed to sink
the shaft deeper and make the
work of getting out the ore
cheaper and easier. Patago
nian. The Cochise County Draft
Board announced today that or
ders had been received from the
adjutant's office at Phoenix that
no further special or voluntary
inductions will be allowed, hav
ing all been closed to regis
trants. This means that any
registered man who could have
previously selected any special
branch of the service as many
have done, will now have to
wait until he is called by the
board to be sent to Camp Funs
ton. Prospector.
The quantity of corn remain
ing on Arizona farms March 1,
1918, was 173,000 bushels or 20
per cent of the 1917 crop, ac
cording to the government grain
report issued today. Corn of
the 1916 crop on farms March 1,
1917, amounted to 77,000 bushels
or 10 per cent of the crop; and
of the 1915 crop, 96,000 bushels
or 16 per cent of the crop was
on farms March 1, 1916. The
proportion of the 1917 crop mer
chantable was 80 per cent.
About 86 per cent of the 1916
crop was merchantable; and of
the 191o crop, 8o rer cent.
Continuous and heavy rains
for 40 hours passed over every
foot of Yavapai county, smash
ing all previous records for
many years is amount of pre
cipitation for a single storm.
According to reports received at
the S. F. P. & P. office in Pres
cott, the downpour was the
heaviest south of Hillside and in
the Humboldt country. The
scene on the desert was remark
able, and a solid sheet of water
was in evidence at many places,
wagon and auto traffic being
forced to a standstill. From
none of the higher elevations
was a snow report sent in, and
the benefits mining and ranging
will receive are incalculable.
MORE TROOPS CALLED.
Eight hundred thousand men
are to be called to the colors
during the present year. During
five days beginning March 29,
95,000 men will be mobilized at
the various cantonments. Of
these 80,000 will be men of the
first draft and 15,000 of the sec
ond. Men will be called grad
ually in an effort to prevent in
terference with production, espe
cially on the farms. There will
be no sweeping withdrawal of
large numbers at any one time.
Care will be taken not to inter -fere
with harvesting.
The 800,000 men to be sum
moned this year represent the
number necessary to fill up all
existing divisions, to create all
the army corps and field army
troops to fill out the war ma
chine for which the frame work
already exists and to provide a
quarter of a million replacement
troops. When they have been
mobilized, which will not be
completed before the lirst of
next year, there will be more
than 40 full infantry divisions of
27,700 men and each and all the
additional units necessary. No
additional divisions of the na
tional army or national guards
will be created this year, al
though the program for the re
gular army, now composed of
eight infantry and one cavalry
division, may be enlarged.
The first purpose of the war
department is to complete the
first field army in France. Pro
bably this will be composed of
five army corps of six infantry
divisions each. It has been es
timated that with that force and
its necessary auxiliaries at his
disposal, Gen. Pershing would
be able to hold a 100 mile sector
of the battle front, relieving the
strain upon French man power
during 1918 to that extent. What
that would mean to France may
be judged from published state
ments of French officials that on
January 1, 1918, the Belgian
army held about fifteen miles of
the western front, the British
front, the British forces about
195 miles and the French 350
miles. Messenger.
They Need Comfort From Home.
According to Sir Walter Law
rence, an English veteran of
many hard campaigns, "The
man who gets a letter from
home is a 50 per cent better
fighter that day than the man
who does not. The great thing
is to write and write cheerful
ly." Just as good as a letter is
the town paper. See that it
goes to the man in camp or
abroad just as long as he can be
reached. It's a sort of commun
ity message to him. Maybe you
remember that old song, "Oh,
it's great to see a man from your
old home town." How much
greater it is in a foreign land to
receive kindly word that the old
home town is back of you and is
proud of you. So don't forget
to write the lads you hammered
on the back before they march
ed.away last fall to the training
camps. Graham Guardian.
COST FOR RECRUITS.
It has cost $4.22 a man to re
cruit in Arizona for the National
Army. This figure is somewhat
lower than the average over the
nation. In California the cost
was $4.41; in New Mexico $6.24;
Utah, $3 85, and Texas $3.88.
The smallest states seem to have
been among the most costly. In
Delaware the expense was $19.00
per man, in Vermont $13.12 and
in Rhode Island $13.00. In the
big state of North Dakota, it was
only $1.83. It is interesting to
note that the average per capita
is less than in 1862, when the
draft cost was $9.84. Sun.
Soldiers and Sailors who have
been buying Southern Pacific
land on the installment plan
need not worry about their pay
ments until the war is over.
They have until nine months
after thbt time before they have
to resume their obligations, ac
cording to B. A. McAllaster,
land commissioner of the com
pany. This applies both to in
terest and to principal.
RAILROAD MEN LOYAL.
"There is no group of men
anywhere in the world whose
loyalty, patriotism and sense of
obedience is greater than that of
officials of every grade in Amer
ican railroad life. "This is the
declaration made by President
William Sproule of the Southern
Pacific Company in an address
before the San Francisco Trans
portation Club, denying the ac
cusation that railroad officers
were not loyally responding to
government control.
Sprout said in part:
"I have read with dismay that
the charge has been made that
the railroad heads of this coun
try do not wish Governmont
control of the railroads in this
time of war to be successful, and
are trying to prevent its success.
I have faith that such a traitor
ous charge has not found lodg
ment in the public mind, for
there is no group of men any
where in the world whose loyal
ty, patriotism and sense of ob
edience is greater tnan that of
officials of every grade in Amer
ican railroad life. I can say
this as a railroad man to rail
road men who have given their
lifetime to the work.
"This charge is as damnable
as it is deceitful and is a gross
calumny upon the railroad men
of this great country, I adjure
you, even as I lay the duty of
thee upon myself, to stand firm
against touch or taint of dis
loyalty. In this time of the
Nation's trial let us stand firm
against even the carping criti
cism of the Government in which
it is so easy to indulge without
thinking of its evil effect. Any
country that is not loyal to its
Government in times of stress,
is not a nation.
"Let us help in every way we
can. The war must ba won. It
is the privilege of each one of us
to do his share to achieve that
great and imperative result."
BUY WAR SAVINGS STAMPS.
Every time you buy a War
Savings Stamp you weaken the
Hinderburg line.
Better to sacrifice luxuries
than sacrifice lives we can sure
ly Lend our money.
Invest in War Savings Stamps
In asking the people to invest
in War Savings and Thrift
Stamps, the government is not
asking them to contribute money.
It is merely asking for the use
of the money and is willing to
pay liberally for it.
The government simply wishes
to employ your money and pay
you for its service, just as it
would employ you and pay you
for your services.
You will get your money back
with interest compound interest
at the rate of 4 per cent per an
num. The stamps mature in five
years, but you can cash them at
any time you wish before the
date of maturity, and get in
terest at 3 per cent.
If you need the service of
your money before five years,
the Savings Stamps handed to
the postmaster will be the letter
of resignation and you wiil get
your money back, with addition
al payment for the time you
have permitted the government
to use it.
There is no red tape, no both
er, no uncertainty, no work. It
is the simplest, safest and most
satisfactory investment you can
make.

Catarrhal Deafness Cannot Be Cured
by local applications, as the-y cannot reach

Catarrhal Deafness Is caused by an ln

inflamed you have a rumbllns sound or
Imperfect hearing, and when It Is entirety

inflammation can be reduced and this tube
restored to Its normal condition, hearing;
will be destroyed forever. Many cases of
deafness are caused by catarrh, which Is
an inflamed condition of the mucous sur

COURTESY.
Service.
The Spirit of Friendship.
This store looks upon its patrons not
merely as customers but as friends.
People purchase here because they
have friendly feeling for this store.
The cause which develops this friendly
feeling, may differ, iu fact, they are
sure to differ. One's friendship for
the store is the result of finding good
values; another's is the result of effi
cient service and courteous treatment,
and so on.
Naturally this friendshiply feeling on
the part of our patrons is reciprocated
on our part. And this spirit of mutual
friendship is an impetus for greater
service and an incentive to ever in
creasing endeavor to make this store
a place where every visitor will feel
perfectly at home.

the committee on public infor
mation. It is a handbook for
ready reference on the great
war, and contains in some 300
pages a great mass of informa
tion simply arranged and clearly
stated. It is issued in response
to an insistent demand from
many students, writers, clergy
men, lawyers, business men and
the public at large for authentic
statements of the outstanding
facts concerning the war in al
phabetical arrangement.
Because of its special value
and the high cost of printing, a
small price of 23 cenj;s a copy
has been fixed by the govern
ment to cover the cost of pro
duction and distribution. It may
be obtained from the Committee
on Public Information, 10 Tack

making a big k ick about the
price of meat but the proprietors
of these places have not lowered

sell at 25 cents and menus carry
the same rate as when eggs sold
at 60 cents.
