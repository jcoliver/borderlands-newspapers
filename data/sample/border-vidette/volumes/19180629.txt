Under the Smith-Hughes Act
passed by the last session of
congress, a large sum of money
was allotted to the state of Ari

people in various trades, agri

and, the state, having appro

evident that much more atten

In a letter to Congressman
Hayden, Adjutant General Mc
Cain gives assurances that every
effort will be made to allow
drafted men or those inducted
into the service of the United
States and sequestered in can
tonments to cast their votes for
officers at state primary elections
or at the general elections fol
lowing. This will be in com-
nliance with the law of any
state which provides tor tne
soldier vote within the United
States. All soldiers who may
be authorized by law to vote,
will have a chance to mark their
ballots secretly in the canton
ments or within the naval reser
vations, and these ballots will
be promptly forwarded to the
officers of the state entitled to
leceive same.
The department of justice has
advised Thomas Flynn, United
States attorney that the depart
ment received from time to time
information showing that many
citizens of the United States
have escaped to foreign coun
tries in order to avoid military
duty.
Attorney General Gregory
states that it is the desire of the
department of justice that in
dictments should be returned in
every case of this character
where the facts in the opinion of
the federal attorney are suffi
cient to support an indictment.
The attorney general believes
that the indictments should be
returned regardless of the fact
that there is no immediate pro
bability of apprehending the
slacker who shirks his duty.
In all cases of this type com
ing to the attention of the de
partment of justice information
will be forwarded to the special
agent in charge of that work at
Phoenix and he will make a
thorough investigation of the
matter. In many cases the spe
cial agents will be supplied by
the department of justice with
information in the form of inter
cepted letters and other docu
mentary proof, necessary to es
tablish the fact of foreign residence.
No doubt many cases of local
slackers who have moved across
the Mexican border since the
passing of the draft act have
come under the attention of the
federal attorney and the sug
gested method of returning in
dictments in these cases will in
all probability prevent men who
have left this country to evade
service from ever returning to
their native land. Prospector.

While Arizona is the one real
copper state of the Union every
effort is being made to increase
production. Three new plants
will be brought in about the

33th Infantry. Commencing at
8 o'clock in the morning and
continuing during the morning a

Everyone should turn out to

Mr. Hearst Answers Colonel Roosevelt
G

u ggests Joint
M
R. ROGSEVELT has sent to the Senate tra thou
sand words of denunciation of the President
of the United States, of Secretary Baker, of
Postmaster General Burleson, and of the Hearst news
papers. He han caused this diatribe to be printed in the
Congressional Record and distributed broadcast among
our people at the very moment when the war i" reach
ing itr most arduoun and most critical stage.
I very sincerely believe that Mr. Roosevelt iz mak
ing a grave mistake in endeavoring to distract our
leaders, disturb the machinery of our Government, and
of our military operations, and spread doubt and dis
trust and dissension among cur people at this serious
time. Thiri is the time above all times for the sacrifice
of our personal aspirations and antagonisms.
It is the time for the exercise of our utmost com
bined endeavor, for the exertion of our most vigorous,
united action.
it is net a time for discussion and dissension and
detraction.
Ail loyal Americans, individuals and institutions
shouid join together, regardless of personal or political
prejudices, and work harmoniously to help cur Presi
dent and our people to win the war.
This the Hearst publications have earnestly and
consistently endeavored to do.
From the very first day of the Avar the Hearst
newspapers have believed that victory would be won
by the united effort and energy of all our people, and
not by the bickering and fault-finding: of a few of our
people.
The day before war was declared the Hearst
papers said that the MANAGEMENT of the war should
be confided to the Executive ; that while deliberation
and many counsellors were good in peace, un divided
authority and responsibility were necessary in war.
The day after war was declared the Hearst papers
urged "an army of a million men," '"the largest increase
that could possibly be made in the navy," and "in
numerable aeroplanes and seaplanes."
The leaders of both parties in Congress opposed
universal service, or any form of "selective conscrip
tion." But the Hearst papers circulated petitions from
the Atlantic to the Pacific, and collected more than
2,000,000 signatures asking Congress to pass the
Selective Conscription Act.
"Only by using the full strength of the nation.
AND EVERY MAN'S STRENGTH WHERE IT IS
MOST NEEDED, can the full power of the nation be ex
erted," was the definite verbatim expression of this pe
tition. 1 myself went personally to Washington to urge
my former associates in Congress to vote 'or selective
conscription, and on April 27 published a four-column
signed article in the Washington Post advocating it.
After the fight for the selective draft was won,
the Hearst papers called for the conquest of the air.
More than twenty editorials, some of them full pages,
urged the appropriation of the $640,000,000 for aero
planes and aviators, which was finally secur id.
Another urgent need was merchant ships. FOR
TWO YEARS BEFORE THE WAR the Hea t papers
fought with vigor and persistency for a Government
built merchant marine. But the bill providing for it
was killed by a filibuster, in which Senators Penrose
and Oliver, Elihu Root and Henry Cabot Lodge of
Massachusetts all friends of Mr. Roosevelt's joined.
But for this filibuster, we might have had at least
a year ago the ships required to defeat the submarine.
The selective draft, ships and aeroplanes having
been provided, the Hearst newspapers next petitioned
Congress "for temperance during the war;" to stop-.the
use of foodstuffs for making whisky. This legislation
was accomplished in sixty days, but the Hearst papers
had been making a sustained fight against whisky for
five years.
' To aid the First Liberty Loan, 914 columns of
news, editorials and cartoons were published in the
Hearst papers alone.
Many thousands of posters on the Liberty Loan,
drawn by Hearst cartoonists, were posted in all the
great cities of the country. One of them, published
May 24, 1917, was so effective that R. W. Woolley, di
rector of publicity of the Treasury Department, Wash
ington, requested copies for every Federal Reserve
Bank in the United States 7700 in number and they
were furnished free.
"Your work deserved unmeasured commendation,"
wrote the Government's Director of Publicity.
To aid recruiting to the navy, the marines and the
volunteer army, the Hearst newspapers created and
manned recruiting stations in the principal cities of the
Union.
In New York City MORE THAN HALF of the en
listments were made at New York American stations.
o cat
Proper Time
Secretary of the Navy Daniels sent, unsolicited, a
dispatch saying:
Yovur cc-opcration in bringing the job and the j
zrzan together has rendered the navy opportune artel
impcricnt acs:sfciTicc. '
Food control, the next great issue en the war pro- I
fram, divided the country and Congress.
The Hearst papers, and I, personally, urged ONE- i
MAN CONTROL, instead of a commission of three.
On July 24, 1917, in a signed statement in my news-
papers, I said : j
The President desires one mart instead cf a.
commission cf . three to exercise the power cf feed
conircl conferred by the food bill. The President L".

for etrr couiitry and cti- Allies is a mistake and
chotdd be stricken from the bill. . j
individual authority arid responsibility tnaha
for alacrity a.'td c. decency in pzzblic cervicc.
After two months, Congress passed the bill putting
Mr. Hocvcr in cole control of food.
The President's war message, later his reply to the
Pope and recent Memorial Day proclamation were
greeted by the Hearst papers as "historic documents
that should be preserved."
They were published in colors on calendared peper
and more than 100,000 copies of each were distributed
free.
The Government departments, Department of Edu
cation, New York Public Library and the Y. M. C. A.
asked for mere than 10,000 copies of these art reprints
for their various branches, and there, like all the others,
were furnished free. ,
Marshal JoTre's visit to the United States was com- j
memorated in a handsome volume, bound in vellum and
mounted in gold and enamel, containing the photo-
graphs, speeches and descriptive accounts of his vk,it,
and souvenirs of many cities.
This volume, officially accepted by the French Com
mission, was presented to Field Marshal Joffre in the
presence of his staff in Paris by General Pershing in j
benalf of the Hearst publications.
To promote the Second Liberty Loan the Hearst
newspapers devoted 1295 columns of news, editorials
and cartoons, and to aid the Third Liberty Loan the
Hearst newspapers devoted 1910 columns of news,
editorials and cartoons.
The subscriptions of the Hearst publications and
employes to the Liberty Loans have been over half a
million dollars; their contributions to the Red Cross
have been over fifty thousand dollars.
In all these matters the Hearst newspapers, "doing
right as God gives us to see the right," have tried to be
the most vigilant agents of the public interests by their
ACTS as well as by words.
Of Mr. Roosevelt and others like him, who find
unpatriotic occupation in denouncing the Administra
tion, and who seem more interested in their personal
ambitions and political prejudices than they are in win
ning the war, I would like to ask the plain question :
What have you done to give you the right to criti
cise the Administration and its splendid achievements,
or to justify you in assuming superior virtue and value
to the Hearst papers, which have consistently supported
the Administration and conscientiously endeavored in
every way to help the Government win the war?
As far as I can see, Mr. Roosevelt has clone nothing
but savagely and sensationally attack the President of
the United States and his Cabinet during this critical
war period, and has done this for partisan political pur
poses and, what is worse, for pay.
As far as I can see, one of the main objects of Mr.
Roosevelt's latest furious attack upon the Administration
was to aid and advertise those magazines and news
papers which pay him and support him and to reflect
upon those magazines and newspapers which do not hire
him or admire him.
As far as I can see, no matter what the motive of
these continued attacks may be, whether it be partisan
and personal, or well intended and merely misguided,
the result can only be harmful to our Government, harm
ful to the spirit of our people, harmful to the morale of
our armies, harmful to our country and our country's
cause.
After the war is over, therefore, or, better, after
this present crisis is over, I shall be glad to debate with
Mr. Roosevelt upon the public platform whether his
critical efforts or my constructive efforts have accom
plished the more toward helping America bring this
great war to a speedv and successful conclusion.
