HIGHWAY TO CAMPS IS BEING
IMPROVED.
Supervisors Harrison. Ash
burn and Finley, accompanied
by C. B. Wilson, viewed the
roads leading from Patagonia to
townsand camps in the south
eastern part of the county last
Monday. The party went out
by way of - Harshaw, Mowry,
Washington Camp, Duquesne
and Lochiel and returned by the
Valley route. It was the unani
mous opinions of the supervisors
that the roads in question were
in need of repair, and work on
the highways commenced Wed
nesday morning with four men
and two teams, beginning at the
hill in Patagonia near the school
house and continuing to the
southeast. While the county
road fund" is short of money it is
estimated by the supervisors
that approximately $4000 ran be
spent in improvements on the
roads in question.
The people of the district af
fected owe a debt of gratitude to
C. B. Wilson for the interest he
has taken in securing better
roads. ,
A good country road is always
to be desired and is a source of
comfort and convenience to every
traveler. Good roads attract po
pulation, as well as good schools
and churches. Good roads im
prove the value of the property,
so that it is said a farm lying
five miles from market, connect
ed by a bad road, is of less value
than an equally good farm lying
ten miles away from market
connected by a good road. A
larger load can be drawn by one
horse over a good road than by
two ovwa bad one. Good roads
encourage the greater exchange
of products and cpmmodities be
tween one section and another.

Don't Want Political Machine.
The action of Governor Camp
bell in vetoing the Highway Bill
will not find favor with the peo
ple of this State, especially when
it is learned that his objection
to the measure was caused by
the fact that the legislature
named the highway commission,
of which he' was to be a mem
ber, instead of allowing him the
power to name the entire com
mission. Mr. Campbell was elected to
office, not because the people
loved him more, but because
they loved the Hunt brand of
machine politics less. The very
fact that he vetoed the Highway
Bill because the appointing pow
er was not vested in him, makes
it clear that the republican party
is preparing the way for ma
chine politics, a proposition that
is certain to become unpopular.
Governor Campbell's further
contention that he was the only
agent in f.he State who could
transact highway business with
the Federal government is also
wrong. i ne iact is inat wnen
the government accepts a pro
position of road building in con
junction with the State, it does
so on a 50 50 basis that is the
work must be done under ac
cepted plans and specifications
by the government engineer, and
the State pays all bills up to the
completion of the work. If the
work is not accepted by the gov
ernment, it will not pay over its
haif of the cost. The governor
is not consulted in the matter.
He has nothing to do with it.
The whole transaction rests with
the State engineer or those ap
pointed by the highway commis
sion to carry out the work.
What the people of this State
want is good roads, not a politi
cal machine, and any delay in
building roads on account of
playing politics, will not be tole
rated. Road building should begin at
once and furnish work to return
ing soldiers and sailors and the
men who are losing their jobs in
the mines on account of the
over production of copper and
decreased selling price of the
red metal. Guardian.

G. W. Parker of San Rafael, has

INCOME TAX DELINQUENTS.
Internal Revenue Collector
Franklin made the following
statement today, which should
be good news to taxpayers who
have not filed their income tax
returns: "Owing 'to the very
short time allowed taxpayers to
file their returns, and further to
the fact that not all of the prop
er forms were received until a
few days ago there are a large
number of persons who did not
tile returns. In some instances,
of course, the taxpayers are at
fault, but others are to be ex
cused because of the .unusual
circumstances. The Treasury
Department has advised that re
turns may be accepted if the
taxpayer will attach a statement
to the return, setting forth bis
reason for delay. This state
ment will accompany the tax re
turn to Washington and will be
passed up6n by the Commission
er. If the reason is good and
sufficient there will be no penal
ty assessed. This gives all an
opportunity to get right with
the Government, and I hope that
those who are delinquent will
see that their returns are filed
immediately.1'
DIPLOMACY OF EARLY DAYS.
Although our forefathers achi
eved independence from Eng
land at the close of the Revolu
tionary war, the Bridish govern
ment made a motion to recon
sider in 1812.
Just before the battle of New
Orleans, which was fought after
peace was declared, but previous
to the news reaching America,
there was some shirt sleeve di
plomacy between Andrew Jack
son and the British general.
Pakenham, scorning the back-,
woods general and disdaining
ordinary courtesy, wrote:
Jackson, surrender New Or
leans! Jackson wrote back:
Pakenham, come and take it.
Pakenham wrote:
Jackson, I expect to take my
breakfast in New Orleans, Sun
day morning.
Jackson responded:
Pakenham if you do, you will
take your supper in hell Sunday
night.
PRESERVE WILD GAME.
At a recent conference of for
est supervisors of Arizona and
New Mexico, held in Albuquer
que, how to preserve the wild
game of the southwest), was a
main subject of discussion and
consideration. The national for
ests of Arizona and New Mexico,
embracing an erea of twenty
million acres of mountain forest
ed land, the chief range of the
game of the southwest, is in dan
ger of being stripped of its wild
game unless further legislation
is had in the matter of protec
tion, was the declaration of the
conference. The forest super
visors offered their full co opera
tion in working out an adequate
system of game protection on
the national forests, urging to
that end a creation of a system
of small game refuges, thus giv
ing a safe refuge to the breeding
stock of game animals.

WILL HE DO IT?
Governor Has Power to Give Arizona
Better Highways.
Phoenix. Ariz., March 20.
A chance remains that Arizona
may yet have what she wants
and most desires a medern
highway department, through
which can be secured an ade
quate system of state highways.
The chance, however, is a re
mote one, for it depends entirely
upon Governor Campbell, and
he has as yet shown no evidence
of caring is much for highways
as he does for his own power
and authority.
Before the legislature ad journ
ed, it passed Senate Bill No.
185, vwhich provides for a state
highway commission, to consist
of three high-grade business
men of, the state, of known in
tegrity and ability. These men,
under the terms of the bill, are
to be appointed by a state high
way board, consisting of the
governor, the secretary of state,
the state treasurer, the president
of the senate and the speaker of
the house, and it is generally
conceded by fair minded people
that these officers, who were
themselves chosen by the peo
pie, could be relied upon to
choose a high grade highway
commission. However, Gover
nor Campbell vetoed Senate-Bill
No. 17, which contained pro
visions similar to Senate Bill
No. 185, chiefly in fact, al
though he assigned other rea
sons, it is generally considered
that he did so entirely for the
reason, that the measure failed
to leave him in sole and unlimit
ed authority over the commis
sion. Therefore, it is assumed
that the same fate awaits the
late bill passed by the Legisla
ture, despite the fact that it
would provide the most modern
machinery for the management
of the State Highway Depart
ment, and would supply a splen
did fund $1,500,000.00 per year
for highway construction, and
enable the state to take full ad
vantage of the splendid federal
appropriations available for co
operation with the states. Gov
ernor Campbell's failure to rise
to the accasion and give his ap
proval to the legislation before
him will undoubtedly meet with
the severest condemnation, but
it is nevertheless more than an
even bet that his partisanship
and vanity will prevail, and that
there will be no highway legis
lation which does not acknowl
edge him as lord and master.
Anent the highway tangle, the
Republican newspapers of Phoe
nix the Arizona Republican and
the Arizona Gazette have has
tened, in their desire to square
the Governor with the people,
to give out a story to the effect
that Governor Campbell pro
posed to approve a bill in which
George Kinerdon of Jerome, Geo.
Olney of Phoenix and judge
Frank J. Duffy, of Nogales,
would be named as the state
highway commission, but the
legislature would not agree.
From an absolutely authoritative
source the truth of the matter
has been learned. As a result
of negotiation with two Demo
cratic senators the Governor did
agree to approve a bill which
would name Kingdon, Olney and
Duffy as commissioners, but
when the senators, after secur
ing the sanction of their fellow
senators to the plan, returned to
notify the governor, he advised
them that he could that make
up bis mind until later. When
the hour agreed upon for the
announcement of his decision
arrived the Governor stated that
he still could not make up his
mind, and he has not made it up
yet, so far as any member of the
Legislature has been able to
learn. In the meantime, the two
houses of the Legislature went
ahead and did their duty, and
Senate Bill 185, which is now
in the Governor's hands, is the
result. It is very evident that
the Legislature was willing to
meet the Governor on any reas
onable basis, but the Governor,
according to some, was ende
avoring to trick the solons into
yieiding to his terms, or accord
ing to others, his unstable mind
and vacillating character were
working true to form, and he
could not arrive at a decision in
time to effect the legislation
which was being considered.
Nevertheless the fact remains
that the Governor can give Ari
zona a highway, department if
he wants to, the bill is before
him there is nothing to keep
him from signing it.
WIRT BOWMAN GOING TO TEXAS
Will Personally Look After His- Big
Oil Interests.
Friday evening Hdn. Wirt G.
Bowman, state representative,
whose work in the Arizona legis
lature has been taking his time
the past two monlhis, returned
from Phoenix and now he is
engaged in arranging his per
sonal affairs so he can go to
Texas to give attention to his
oil interests in that state in the
vicinity of Wichita Falls, the
new oil fields which are attract
ing attention so great, viz.: the
Burk-Burnett field.
In conversation with The
Oasis reporter yesterday evening
Mr. Bowman stated that he had
acquired a good ly interest in two
very good locations, both within
a short distance of the famous
Humble well, for which the lucky
owners have been offered 20,
000,000 for a half interest, which
wonderful offer was turned down.
Of course they have a great
gusher that gives a remarkable
production and seems inexhaust
ible. In his own investments Mr.
Bowman has been very success
ful. Upon one location of 2i
acres in which he acquired a
one thirteenth interest his asso .
ciates have drilled one well
which is producing 800 barrels
of oil daily, and a, second is going
down. On the tract there is room
for four more wells. The thirteen
lucky owners have refused $300,
000 for the tract. (Wno will
maintain thirteen to be an un
lucky number.)
Another tract in which Mr.
Bowman is interested is adjacent
to the Humble ground, and in
that the gentleman and his
associates have great faith. On
all sides the adjacent ground is
oil bearing,, no less than five wells
producing very profusely the
Humble greatest of all. In that
ground Mr. Bowman and his
associates believe they will bring
in another Humble well very
shortly.
Mr. Bowman is giving atten
tion to his multifarious affairs in
Nogales in order that he may
leave them for a time and give
his entire time and attention to
development of his - Texas oil
interests and he expects to be
able to leave the lattei part of
tb,is week. Oasis.
MORGAN MAY HELP MEXICO.
A recent Washingtou dispatch
says: Information reached here
today through official channels
that Rafael Nieto, acting minis
ter of finance of Mexico, who
visited New York recently seek
ing a loan for rehabilitation pur
poses, is returning to Mexico
City to lay before president Car
ranza conditions under which J.
P. Morgan would undertake to
organize a British France Amer
ican group of bankers to finance
Mexico.
Conditions understood to have
been outlined by Mr. Morgan
were that Mexico should show
an inclination to pay at least
some of the interest on her for
eign debt, which has been un
paid since 1913; that the interna
tional group of bankers should
control the handling of the funds,
and that the Mexican goverment
should prove that conditions are
returning to normal and furnish
guarantees in the form of taxes
to repay any loans may be made.
In official circles here the re
cent invitation of Carranza to
Jose Ives Limantour to return to
Mexico is regarded as a favor
able omen. Limantour, who was
finance minister under Diaz for
many years, has been living in
France since the downfall of
Diaz. He is regarded here as one
of the ablest of Latin-American
financiers.

KILL FLIES-SAVE LIVES.
To rid a town of flies, every
body must do his bit.
There are many kinds of flies
all harmful.
Flies breed in filth, feed on it,
live in it, and contaminate every
thing they lay their hairy little
legs on.
It is a very good thing- to
swat, trap., or poison flies, but
it is still better to prevent their
breeding:
By keeping stables clean.
By removing all manure at
least twice a week.
By keeping garbage in recep
tacles, with close-fitting covers,
which should be emptied and
washed out frequently.
By building only fly-proof san
itary privies when sewers are
not available.
The time to begin a campaign
against, flies is before any have
been seen in March or in April
of each year.
A pair of flies born in April
may give origin to millions by
August. Do not let those mil
lions come into existence. Keep
the first pair from breeding.
Strict cleanliness and imme
diate destruction of all filth are
the best measures against flies.
Outhouses, homes, markets,
bakeries, and all food establish
ments should be creened against
flies.
Remember: No flies, no filth,
no flies, less disease.
SUMMER VACATIONS MAY 25TH
Summer vacations of the pub
lic schools of this city will com
mence on May 25th, according
to announcement made by G. H.
Madden this morning, says Wed
nesday's Herald.
This is later than the usual
closing day of the schools, Mr.
Madden said, but the delay wiH
permit the schools to make up
practically all of the time lost
during the present term.
The session of the school was
late starting this year, it was
announced, because the building
was not completed in time, and
the schools were not opened
until two weeks after the other
schools of the state were com
menced.
Considerable time has also
been lost, during this session of
the schools by reason of the
quarantine on account of the in
fluenza epidemic. Much of the
time lost, through this cause

YUMA VALLEY BARLEY.
Yesterday (March 13) a pros
perous farmer from the Yuma
Valley brought to the Commer
cial Club a barley sample, which
is rather remarkable. The bar
ley when it was cut was four
feet high and it was completely
headed on the 12th day of March.
Back east when farmers are just
thinking of getting ready Nfor
the summer crops, barley in the
Yuma Valley is ready to cut.
March is an early month for
barley, and the specimen receiv
ed by the Commercial Club is
one of the finest specimens whjch
has ever been received. Yes
terday a ne w sample of Peru
vian alfalfa was brought in.
This alfalfa is from 'a winter
crop. The last cutting was made
on the field about January 26thj
Now the alfalfa is 36 inches
high, and coing down under the
mpwer. The growth of alfalfa
at this rate in the dead of winter
is rather remarkable, but it is in
the Yuma Valley that things
can be seen actually growing.

The readers of this paper will be
pleased to learn that there is at least
one dreaded disease that science has
been able to cure in all its stages, and
that is catarrh. Catarrh being greatly
influenced by constitutional conditions
requires constitutional treatment.
Mall's Catarrh Cure is taken internally
and acts thru the Klood on the Mucous
Surfaces of the System thereby de
stroying the foundation of the disease,
giving the patient strength by building
up the constitution and assisting na
ture in doing its work. The proprie
tors have so much faith in the curative
powers of Hall's Catarrh Cure that
they offer One Hundred Dollars for any
case that it fails to cure. Send for list
of testimonials.
