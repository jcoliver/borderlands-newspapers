The Spirit of Friendship.
This store looks upon its patrons not
merely as customers but as friends.
People purchase here because they
have friendly feeling for this store.
The cause which develops this friendly
feeling, may differ, in fact, they are
sure to differ. One's friendship for
the store is the result of finding good
values; another's is the result of effi
cient service and courteous treatment,
and so on.
Naturally this friendshiply feeling on
the part of our patrons is reciprocated
on our part. And this spirit of mutual
friendship is an impetus for greater
service and an incentive to ever-increasing
endeavor to make this store
a place where every visitor will feel
perfectly at home.

ARIZONA NOTES.
Items of Interest Culled From Our
Exchanges.
The government has reclassed
as non mineral the Valentine
Script location in Pima county,
formerly adjudged mineral lands
at the request of the New Cor
nelia company, it was announc
ed today by United States land
office officials, saying the mining
company proposes to use the
lands as a millsite.
Believing that the world will
end between the 17th and 20th
of December in accordance with
the prediction of the French as
tronomer, Porta, not a few per
sons have committed suicide in
Mexico City, according to a spe
cial dispatch from the capital to
El Tiempo, a newspaper pub
lished at Cananea, Sonora.
The heaviest flow of waters
known in years is now rushing
through the canyons of the Hua
chuca mountains, as a result of
the heavy rains, according to
visitors in Bisbee from the
mountain districts. Water is
now running in Miller canyon in
the Huachucas all the way to
the San Pedro river, a condition
unprecedented in the history of
that section in over a decade,
even during the heaviest sum
mer floods.
Unusually heavy rains have
fallen over the southern and
desert sections of the range dis
trict, saturating the sou and
giving an impetus to the growth
of winter annuals. Winter ranges
have been greatly improved by
the downpour and stock have
suffered but little as temperat
ures have been moderate. For
tunately in the north where it
has been colder precipitation
was unimportant. Reports from
nearly all sections indicate that
little feeding of range stock will
be required during winter.
The Arizona Anti Tuberculosis
Association sent out a letter last
week to all churches and syn
agogues in the state, asKing
them to co-operate in making
Sunday, December 7tb, a Health
Day and bring the message of a
sound mind in a sound body to
their congregations. The asso
ciation has been receiving by
every mail replies showing that
Arizona ministers are interested
in this subject. On that day
ministers all over the state will
bear the message of Health and
Happiness to their people. They
will also announce the safe of
Red Cross Christmas Seals which
provide the finances for the
health program of the state association.

Barnes' Wild Animal
Wireless for Border Planes.
Wireless telephone sending
apparatus is now being used to
guide the aerial patrol of the
Mexican border line, according
to Colonel J. E. Hemphill, chief
signal officer of the Western De
partment, who is soon to leave
for the border to inspect the
wireless equipment. Four new
sending stations have been in
stalled, Colonel Hemphill says,
each with a radius of 100 miles,
says the Nogales Herald.
The object of the wireless,
said Colonel Hemphill, 'is to
enable the authorities to keep in
momentary communication with
the border patrol of airplanes
that is constantly maintained.
The Mexican border line within
the jurisdiction of the Western
Department of the Army is now
completely equipped with wire
less telephone sending appara
tus that will reach an Army air
plane at any place along the
border.
"The wireless will reduce to a
minimum the chances of a pilot
becoming lost, as the position of
an airplane and its general di
rection from the land station
can be fairly accurately gauged
with the Army's telephonic
equipment. As soon as the sig
nal corps of the Southern Depart
ment completes the installation
of its wireless telephone sets the
Army will have a row of stations
from the Pacific to the Gulf of
Mexico."

In sympathy with the state
ment issued from Washington
by President Wilson and Sur
geon Rupert Blue of the United
States Public Health Service, I
desire to call the attention of
the citizens of Arizona to our
tuberculosis problem. Over 150,
000 persons die annually from
tuberculosis. On account of in
fluenza and examinations during
the war there has been an in
crease of tuberculosis in practi
cally every State in the Union
during the past year. This is a
lerrioie waste oi lire when we
realize that tuberculosis is pre
ventable. Hundreds of people
afflicted with tuberculosis come
to this state every year, and
humanity demands that we do
everything we can to help these
sufferers.
Every year the National Tu
berculosis Association and the
various state associations sell
Kea oross Uhristmas seals to
finance this health program
This year a special effort is be
ing made to interest school child
ren and churches, and I wish to
call attention to December 5th,
6th and 7th, which have been
designated as special days for
the selling of seals and the
preaching of health doctrines in
the schools and churches. The
services of the Anti-tuberculosis
Association in the State were
invaluable during the influenza
epidemic last year, and I hope
that Arizona will respond with
characteristic liberality in the
purchase of Red Cross Seals and
in the observance of the days
mentioned.
In Witness Whereof, I have
hereunto set my hand and caus
ed the Great Seal of the State of
Arizono to be affixed.

Phoenix, December 2, 1919.
My dear Mr. Curtis:
I beg to acknowledge receipt
of your favor of the 5th ult.
The state at large has done
very well. Though not reach
ing the doubled figure we had
hoped, the national assessment
against Arizona will be over
subscribed by 40 per cent. Santa
Cruz passed the doubled assess
ment and Maricopa very nearly
reached her doubled quota of
$6000. I made personal report
of all this to National Chairman
Thompson the other day and he
considered it all very good. With
four counties yet to report, we
already have passed the mini
mum quota.
Very sincerely,
(Signed) Jas. McCeintock,
State Director.

Cattlemen Will Be Prosecuted.
The following telegram from
Phoenix, of recent date, will be
of interest to Arizona cattlemen
who have not re-registered their
brands:
"Secretary Ed. W. Stephens
of the State Livestock Sanitary
Board, gave warning yesterday
that costly litigation is certainty
in the near future for cattlemen
of the state who do not re regist
er their brands before December
12. The official added that in
dividual notices have not been
sent out, partly because many of
the 20,000 registrants are dead
or have been out of the cattle
business for years.
"The re-registration of brands,
according to Secretary Stephens,
is the first that has been made
since the Livestock Sanitary
board was organizer more than
25 years ago. The cost of re
registering is $5, and application
for the required blanks must be
made to the board here. After
December 12, the secretary said,
any brand not re registered, will
be recorded in the name of any
one applying for it. Cattle rust
lers could, if they so desired,
locate herds branded prior to
December 12 and have the brands
registered for themselves, it was
pointed out, involving court ac
tion. "In all cases involving trans
fers of cattle, made in good
faith and reported direct to the
board, wherein the time element
includes the re-registering date,
the Livestock Sanitary board
will protect the transfer, Secre
tary Stephens said."
Globe school buildings now
under construction will cost
$200,000 and new sewer system
$235,000.
