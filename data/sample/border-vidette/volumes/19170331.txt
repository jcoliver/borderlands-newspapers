C. W. (Doc.) Pardee, who has
been on trial in Prescott before
Judge Sawtelle of the federal
court for trie past week, charged
with attempting to aid Joe Davis
to escape from the Prescott jail
was found not guilty. The jury
was so convinced of Pardee's
innocence that the formality of a
ballot was done away with.
Governor Campbell has signed
the anti-tobacco bill which raises
the age limit from 18 to 21. The
bill also strengthens the exist
ing law further by making it a
misdemeanor for a minor to pur
chase, receive accept tobacco,
cigarettes, cigars, or tobacco in
any form, and the same penal
ties which apply to the seller
apply equally to the purchaser.
Even toe giving of cigarette
papers to minors is forbidden.
Renewed activity on some
mining property down the river,
which may have an important
bearing on the future of this min

thirty-five miles to the north of
Benson, at the head of Soza
Canyon, has been acquired by
Messrs. S. S. Culver, of Los An

Rieben, and they are now en
gaged in getting out the ore and
preparing to make shipments.

Arizona's school system is
second to that of no other of the
newer states and better than
that of a great many of the older
states. More money is spent per
capital for schools than in a
majority of the states and in
most instances we believe it is
better spent. The state institu
tions are a university at Tucson
which raokshigh in all respects,
a normal school at Tempe in the
sunny winter clime and another
at Flagstaff in the bracing snow
country of the state.
The first move of the Arizona
state authorities in case war is
declared, and the president asks
for volunteers, will be to fill up
the ranks of the First Arizona
Infantry, now on border duty.
Governor Campbell stated that
in so far as he was able to deduct
from the army regulations, that
Arizona would in case a half
million volunteers are raised,
only be required to put in the
field 2,400 men, that is 800 for
each member of congress. There
are, at present 800 members of
the First Regiment.

It is a fitting tribute to the valor
of those intrepid pioneers whose
bravery in subduing and finally
exterminating the hostile red
skins made possible the building
of the great West.
Several Patagonia citizens are
to became beneficiaries under
the new law. Geo. F. Weiland,
the Jefferson Camp mining man,
who has a splendid record of
many years' service in the Indian
campaigns, is eligible to the pen
sion. So is George Clark, an
other well-known mining man,
associated with Jens Peterson
in the development of the Ame
rican Boy mine in the Santa
Ritas above Patagonia. Mrs.
John Smith, widow of the late
John Smith of Critteaden, is
also eligible to the widow's pen
sion. There may be more Indian
war veterans or their widows in
this community who are entitled
to the pension provided in the
new bill, and if so they are urg
ed to immediately prepare their
discharge papers, or other evi
dence of service, to establish
their eligibility. The bill is said
to be rather liberal in pension
ing all who served in the Indian
campaigns from 1863 to 1891.
The military record of George
Weiland, as disclosed by many
official documents exhibited
since the passage of the Indian
war veterans' bill, is interesting.
When a mere kid he ran away
from his home in Pensylvania
and joined the Union army as a
drunitaerboy in 1862. His father
recured his release, on the min
ority clause, and gavethe young
ster a thorough licking for his
audacity. Later the young man's
ambition to became a, soldier was
gratified when the Government
needed men to fight the Indians.
He promptly enlisted and put
in some strenuous time back in
'76. Mr. Weiland, saw service at
the famous Powder River cam
paign, at the fcJig Horn ana in
the Black Hills. His first dis
charge was on account of sick
ness, but he afterwards re-en
listed and served another three
year term. Later he was iden
tified for many years with the
militia in New Mexico and Ariz
ona. He assisted in the capture
of the notorious Geronimo, and
was with the squad of soldiers
which escorted the infamous old
renegade to Florida, where he
was exiled. Mr. Weiland is not a
very old man yet, notwithstand
ing his great experience and
long and faithful service to his
country. Another national crises
is imminent. He has seen war in
all its phases, and is not anxious
to go, but willing if need be.
What a splendid example to the
youth of a united nation, now
that we hear so much talk of
submarines and that "kultur"
stuff. Patagonian.
ANGULO RANCH IS SOLD.
The Alamo Cattle Cattle Co.
have bought the ranch and cattle
belonging to Gabriel Angulo,
near Amado. The price was in
the neighborhood of $50,000.
There are about 1200 head of
good grade cattle and the ranch
is one of the best in that part of
the country.
Mr. Angulo has not made any
plans yet but will likely re en
gage in the cattle business as he
is a thorough cowman and has
made a success of the busi
ness. The Arizona Cattleman.
Every male person in the Unit
ed States between the ages of 18
and 45 belongs to the unorganiz
ed militia, whether he likes it or
not, and in consequence is sub
ject to compulsory military duty
in emergency. That in substance
is a law enacted back in 1800 and
which has never been repealed,
although it has been many times
amended, to suit mustering needs
of various stages ia the country's
history.
County Engineer Larimore has
finished work on the Washing
ton Duquesne road to connect
with the new bridge, ana this
week has commenced work on
the Patagonia road, says the
Patagonian. Two crews are to
be employed, pne at Bloxton, to
work towards the place where
the new road had been complet
ed this side, of the river, the
other from Sonoita to work to
wards Patagonia. When the
crew at Bloxton has connected
the work from that place to the
new road, it will turn towards
Patagonia. The engineer says
he expects to have a good road
all the way from Rain Valley
through Patagonia to Nogales in
as soon a time as good work will
permit. It. now looks as though
the prediction made by Mr. Lar
imore several weeks ago, that
this road would be completed by
the last of July will be fulfilled.
Road work in this county has
now reached the point where it
will necessarily be slower and
more expensive than any , here
tofore built. In the neighborhood
of Bloxton and on towards Pata
eronia is a routrh. mountainous
count, and from Sonoita this
way, especially in the vicinity of
Mr. Ashburn's ranch, is another
hard piece of road that will re
quire considerable work. There
is a possibility that the route
may be changed at Flux canyon,
below Patagonia, so as to go over
the hills and keep away from
the river. Hope is also express
ed that the road below Sonoita
may be so changed as to avoid
going under the railroad tracks,
which at present is one of the
most dangerous roads in tne
State. Nothing definite is known
about these proposed changes,
however, further thah that the
Supervisors and the county en
gineer have them under consid
eration. Bids for building the road
through Hellgate canyon to con
nect the Oro Blanco country
with Nogales, will be received,
but it is not believed the road
can be built for $20,000, the
amount specified in the call for
bids. This sum may be expend
ed in repairing the old road, in
case contractors are unwilling
to attempt to build the shortcut
for that figure. There is an
other little matter of about $20,
000 which may come out of the
original bond issue of $150,000,
and which seldom enters into
road calculations. It is the seve
ral thousand dollars over esti
mated cost of the new bridge and
the interest and cost of sale of
the bonds.
The Supervisors want it un
derstood they have no intention,
and never had any intention, of
abandoning the old road through
the great Harshaw mining coun
try. A notice having reference
to a proposed new road to con
nect with the San Rafael valley
road, was erroneously posted in
the wrong place, thus causing
many to believe the old Harshaw-Mowry
road was to be
abandoned.
The matter of bridges has not
been decided upon, but it will
probably be necessary to built a
few in this part of the county.
Bridges, however small, cost a
lot of money. It may be for this
reason talk of their construction
is avoided. But if the full benefit
of the new roads is to be enjoyed
throughout the rainy season as
well as in fair weather, bridges
or culverts will have to be built
in several places. The crossing
just out of Patagonia, on the
Harshaw road, where the late
Walter Furtune lost his life, is
the most conspicuous need of a
bridge in this part of the coun
ty. It is feared that unless this
crossing is bridged, the county
may sometime lose another
valuable Supervisor.
He was describing the priva
tions of a voyage from which he
had just returned.
"Then," he said, "I went down
to the cabin to lunch."
"Lunch!" exclaimed one of
his hearers. "But you told us
there was nothing to eat left on
board. What did you have for
lunch!"
"Oh!" was the reply. "It was
a very modest affair beef, wine
and an egg."
"Beef? Where did you get the
beef from?"
"Oh!" was the reply. "That
came from the bulwarks."
"And the wine, how about
that?"
"Oh, that came from the port
hole!"
"Oh, oh!" laughed the listener.
"Good, very good! But tell me
where did you get the egg?"
"Oh, that was the simplest of
all." came the reply. "The
captain gave orders for the ship
to 'lay to, and he gave me
one." Philadelphia Ledger.
PLANT A FEW POTATOES.
The Buckeye Valley News ad
vises every farmer, every man
who owns land, to put in some
potatoes. If not many, then a
few. Plant enough for house
use at least, and supply your
self with spuds even if you
raise none to sell. Even the
back end of your lot if you are
in town will help cut down the
cost of living during the coming
year if well planted and at
tended to; and if every farmer
will plant an acre, or two acres,
or even half an acre, the grand
total of the yield will be increas
ed wonderfully. Every man
should do his part, and plant a
few, as many as possible, but a
few anyway. They will be need
ed, and they will help the farm
and household.

PERSHING IN NOGALES.
Inspects U. S. Troops and Is Enter
tained by Citizens.
Major General John J. Per
shing, commanding the South
ern division of the United States
army, arrived in Nogales last
Tuesday, his private car "Te
che," being attached to the re
gular Tucson-Nogales train. The
distinguished visitor, who came
to inspect the troops stationed
in this district, was met by Col.
Sage, of the 12th Infantry, at
present district commander, and
other army officers, who were
guests at luncheon in General
Pershing's car.
After luncheon, General Per
shing made an inspection of the
troops, which he found in ex
cellent condition.
In the evening the general
was the honor guest at a dinner
given at the Nogales Cafe by
Colonel Sage, those in atteud
ance being Major General Per
shing, Colonel Sage, Colonel
Frier, Colonel Skinner, Colonel
Butts, Major Davis, Lieutenant
Collins, aide to Gen. Pershing,
Acting Mayor Captain L. W.
Mix, Superior Judge W. A. O'
Connor, Colonel A. T. Bird, E.
Titcomb and Mr. Gatter, of the
Espee.
After the dinner an informal
reception was held at the Santa
Cruz Club, which was attended
by a large number of citizens
and officers of the army.
Music was furnished by the
12th Infantry orchestra, and
after the reception dancing was
enjoyed. ,
The Santa Cruz Club Quar
tette, composed of Messrs. K. J.
Brunner, J. H. Bohrer, J. W.
Handy and Arthur H. DeRiemer,
sang a number of songs which
were greatly appreciated.

post, thence to Douglas, from
where he expected to go to Sam
Houston, Texas, where he will
make his headquarters.
TOO MANY FISH.
Mayor H. M. Clagett, Bracey
Curtis, president of the First
National Bank; E. Titcomb, pre
sident of Roy & Titcomb, Inc.;
Theron Richardson, cashier of
the First National Bank, Dr. A.
Lj. Gustetter and Ed. Ralph of
the Immigration Service, have
returned from Guaymas, where
they had the time of their life,
fishing.
All went well until a complaint
was filed by Guaymas fisher
men, to the effect that Mayor
Clagett's party were ruining the
fish business by catching hun
dreds of choice fish which they
gave free of cost to people who
formerly patronized the fish
vendors.
Upon agreeing to limit the
daily catch of each of the No
gales fishermen, to one hundred
and ten, the charge against the
Nimrods was dismissed, thanks
to the influence of John Mc
Pherson and Emery Chalfant,
two prominent Guaymas manu
facturers, who stand well with
the civil and military author
ities, to whom the Mayor and
party are indebted for courtesies
extended during their sojourn at
the bay city.
The gentlemen report having
had a glorious outing.

THE B'-ACK SHEEP.
My friend you worry too much
alout the black sheep in the
flock. You fail to notice the
great number of nice, white
fleeces on the hillside because
you don't take your eyes off the
black spot in the flock. I have
belonged to the best clubs and
we had black sheep among our
members there. I belong to one
of the oldest and greatest lodges
on earth and we have the black
ones with us there. We have
them in church, in society, our
puDlic offices and everywhere
else. There is no place on earth
the black sheep do not browse,
and I have just about come to
the conclusion that when we
cross the river and begin to
tread the golden streets and ad
mire the Jasper walls, the guide
will say to us, "There is Brother
Son and-So. He doesn't stand
well here. Don't believe any
thing he says." I expect over
there to find fellows who can't
take their harp out of an even
ing without putting up the price
of the instrument for security.
Why worry about the black
sheep? He doesn't control the
world. He doesn't even rule
things in your little community.
He won't cut any ice over yon
rlpr. The black sheen we are
i j - I : 4.u 4-1 . I
uuuuu lu uavt: wuu ua, jusu uuc
same as the cramp, colic and
the measles. All you have to
do is to keep your own fleece
nice and white and the black
sheep will not bother you.

today that acts on the new prin
ciple, not only of shriveling up the
corn, but of loosening the corn off

of! with jour iinsors. Put 2 (iropj of

night. That's all. The corn is
doomed sure as sunrise. No pain,
or trouble, or soreness. You clo
