Never in the history of Pinal
county were the county roads in
such line condition as they are
to be found at the present time.
This is especially true of the
new Florence to Casa Grande
road which was completed but
a few weeks ago. Since the
rains of the past two weeks the
roads have been gone over with
a drag and are now hard and
smooth and the Casa Grande
road is like a boulevard, and
that is true of all the roads in
the county that have been grad
ed up to turn water.
For the purpose of, unsealing

never been explored, I. T.
Sparks, traveling freight and

Eastern railroad and Wesley Hill,
proprietor of the Apache Trail

exploration trip in northern Gila
county. The cliff dwellings were
discovered last year and appar

explored by white men. They
are expected to yield important
revelations as to the life and
habits of the aborigines.
An important need of the
State of Arizona is a method by
which some of the many thous
and men employed in the mines
of the state can obtain the ne
cessary knowledge to enable
them to advance in their work.
It is proposed to have the State
Bureau of mines give corres
pondence courses to those who
are not able te attend tne uni
versity, the work being given
primarily for the miner and
prospector, and designed to
help a man better himsef in his
individual position. In addition
to this it is planned to conduct
miners' institutes in various
parts of the state.
Judge Frank Baxter last week
issued an order for a father to
adopt his own son who bad
heretofore been adopted by ano

incidents of court ever seen here.
The father's name is Arthur C.
Clevenger, and he lives at Swan
sea. He is a widower. His son,
Lloyd Clevenger, was adopted
by A. C. Purnell, a widower,
who now lives at Atkinson, Neb
raska. The latter now gives his
permission for the father to adopt
his own flesh back into the fami
ly, and on the petition of the
Arizona father, accompanied by
the permission of the Nebraska
father, Judge Baxter based his
action of re-uniting father and
son. The lad is thirteen years

Acording to advance figures
by Victor C. Heikes of the Unit
ed States Geological Survey,
recently made public, the metal
pruuui tion of ttie state of Ariz
ona during the year l'JIO ex
ceeded $200, CO ), 000. Mr. Heikes'
statement follows:
The output of gold, silver,
copper, lead, and zinc from
minos in Arizona in 191G had a
record total value of nearly $203,
000, 000, compared with $99,806,
349 for 1915. The notable out
put of copper and the high
prices of metals both assisted in
this increase "of 123 per cent.
There were record productions
also of gold, silver, copper, lead,
and zinc.
The production of gold from
Arizona mines increased from
$4,10(3.025 in 1915 to approxim
ately $4,427,000 in 1916, a gain of
over 6 per cent. The produo
tion of goLd from copper ores in
most counties was naturally
greater than in 1915, but there
was a marked decrease in the
output on bullion from amalga
mation and cyanide mills, par
ticularly in Mohave and Mari
copa counties. Several new
gold mines were add ad to the
list during the year, especially
at Oatman, but the production
was not sufficient to offset the
decline in the output of the
older properties.
The production of silver from
the mines increased from 5,649,
020 ounces in 1915 to a record
output of 6,823,000 ounces , in
1916. . As the market price was
much higher, the vnlue increased
from $2,864,053 to nearly $4,490,
000, an increase of nearly 57 per
cent in value. There was no
great change in the production
from the Commonwealth proper
ty, which is principally a silver
producer, so the increase is to
be credited largely to the re
markable output of copper ore.
The mine output of copper
surpassed all records and estim
ates, as increased from 459.972,
295 pounds in 1915 to approx
imately 693,000,000 pounds in
1916. The value of the output,
on account of the unusual
market, increased from $80,455,
152 to nearly $190,000,000. The
increase of 135 per cent in the
value of copper alone in Ariz
ona was therefore more than the
value of the total output of the
state in the previous year. All
the smelting plants of the state
were worked at full capacity,
and made much greater shipmets
of copper bullion.
The mine production of lead
increased from 21,738,969 pounds
in 1915 to a record production of
over 26,000,000 pounds in 1916.
The value of this output increas
ed from $1,021,732 to $1,768,000
or 73 per cent.
The production of zinc from
the mines increased from 18,
220, 863 pounds, valued at $2,
259,387, in 1915 to about 20.880,
000 pounds, valued at $2,374,260
in 1916, an increase of nearly 27
per cent in value. The greater
part of the zinc ore and concen
trates was shipped from the
Golconda and Tennessee prop
erties in Mohave county.
Dividends paid to December 1
amounted to nearly $34,000,000.

Arizona Legis'at Jre Sends Resolution
to Washington.
A resolution denouncing the
setting aside of 3,100,000 acres
in- Pima, Pinal and Maricopa
counties for the Papago Indians
and rocommending the abolish
ment or reduction of this reserva
tion was passed by the house
last week by an unanimous vote.
The resolution is directed to the
secretary of the interior and will
be transmitted to Washington at
once, where a hearing on the
matter is to be held before the
secretary of the interior. The
resolution as adopted by the
house and sent to the senate for
action follows:
"Be it resolved by the Legis
lature of the State of Arizona;
"Whereas, The president of
the United States, upon the re
commendation of the Interior
Departmentof the United States,
by order dated January 14, 1916,
set apari a large tract of land in
the counties of Pima, Pinal and
Maricopa as a reservation for the
Papago Indians, and;
"Whereas, The Indians for
whom said reservation is created
are few in number, and
Whereas, The reservation em
braces approximately three mil
lion acres and withaws said
lands from settlement and from
selection by the state under
grants made to the state and its'
institutions by congress, and
"Whereas, Tha,j$eservation as
it now exists is much larger than
is required for said Indians, and
the withdrawel of said lands
works an injustice upon the
state and its citizens, especially
upon the citizens of the counties
of Pima, Pinal and Maricopa.
"Be it ResefRr, That the sec
retary of the Interior be, and is
trerreby respectff ully requested to
recommend to the president for
his consideration the abolish
ment of said reservation, or that
it be greatly reduced in area."
MILITARY CAMP FOR UNIVER
SITY OF ARIZONA.
The University of Arizona has
recently received notification
from the Secretary of the Inte
rior, Franklin K. Lane, that
Pr.esident Wilson has authoriz
ed the setting aside of 500 acres
of the Coronado National Forest
for use by the University of Ari
zona as a military camp and
tactics station. The land is lo
cated near the entrance to Sa
bino Canyon, and was choaen
particularly because of its de
sirability as a place for encamp
ment in the early spring.
The movement for a location
for a military camp was initiated
by Dr. Von KleinSmidt, presi
dent of the University, who
made a trip east last summer in
order to interview cabinet offi
cials and others regarding the
matter.
Dr. Von Kleinsmidt recently
made a trip to the site in com'
pany with Forest Ranger Sel
kirk, for the purpose of making
plans to locate upon the land
and fix up a permanent military
encampment.
The land is well located, be
ing at a medium altitude, and
contains a spring of fine water
that is never dry.
With the announcement that
the mining companies of the
state had donated a fine mining
building, some unknown friend
had donated $60,000 for a new
observatory, that the national
government had set aside two
sections of land in the Catalinas
for a biological station, and this
last announcement that 500 acres
had been set aside for a military
encampment, makes the year
1916 a banner one in the pro
gress of the institution.
The congress of the United
States is to be congratulated
upon its very prompt endorse
ment of President Wilson's peace
note. The opponents of the pres
ident pretend the president's
action may lead us into the war.
Three months ago these same
opponents were urging the defeat
of President Wilson at the polls
because he didn't plunge us into
war over the invasion of Belgium.
Such hypocracy!
When the meeting of the ex
ecutive committee of the Demo
cratic State Central committee
was called to order at Hotel
Adams on Wednesday, there were
thirty four members present,
either i 1 person or by proxy out
of the thirty eight. Most of these
were present in person.
The call was read and the sub
ject discussed at length. Opinion
was nearly unanimous, the vote
on passing a resolution, the only
action of the committee, being
26 to 8 in favor of standing
squarely behind the governor in
the contest. At least three of
the eight were opposed to any
action whatsoever.
Good nature prevailed and the
discussion was frankly demo
cratic, devoid of abuse or im
punging of motives.
The following resolution was
then passed by decisive vote of
26 to 8:
Phoenix, Ariz., Jan. 10, 1917.
.At a meeting of the executive
committee of the Democratic
State Central committee the fol
lowing resolution was offered by
Senator Hughes of Pima county:
Resolved, That it is the sense
of this meeting that the call of
the meeting of the executive
committee was unnecessary and
that this committee, as a com
mittee, stand unqualifiedly be
hind Governor Hunt, as the
tepresentative of the democracy
of Arizona, in his contest for the
governorship of Arizona.
Carried by a majority vote.
Motion to adjourn was then
made and carried unanimously.
At considerable personal ex
pense the loyal democrats came
from every section of the state.
Only one county was not repre
sented, the county of Greenlee.

THE BOX CANYON ROUTE.
The Southern Pacific has again
taken up the project of securing
a line through the box canyon
of the Gila, Christmas to San
Carlos, and has asked commer
cial bodies interested in the
building of a main line' through
this section, to get behind the
movement. Announcement to
this effect came from. C. M.
Scott, superintendent of the Ari
zona Eastern, in an address to
members of the Phoenix Cham
ber of Commerce', last week.
There are two surveys through
the box canyon of the Gila, on
the low line and one on the high
line. It is understood that the
Southern Pacific is seeking to
secure a right of way along the
low line, which would be far less
exoensive to construct, and if
this can be secured, work will
be begun immediately. The
building of this connecting link
will be of incalculable import
ance to this district, as it would
not only place us on the main
line and in direct commnuica
tion with the large shipping
centers, but it is highly pro
bable that Winkelman will be
made a division point. The
fact that the project is being re
vived at this time, with what
seems to be good prospects of
success is another indication of
the recognition that is being
given this district by the big in
terests of the country. Winkel

High Cost of Living Pinches the Editor
Under the caption, "The Asy
lum for Him," the Newville New
Star says:
"The newspaper man is about
the only great producer who is
not sharing in the war-made
prosperity. Everything he buys
has gone up, and he still sells
his paper at the same old price
and takes a chance at that."
To prove this, he offers the
following:
"Please send a few copies of
the paper containing the obitua
ry of my aunt. Also publish the
inclosed clipping of the marriage
of my niece who lives in Lewis
ton. And I wish you would
mention me in your local column,
if it doesn't cost anything, that
I have two bull calves for sale.
As my subscription is out,
please stop the paper, as times
are too hard to waste money on
newspaper." E. D. MILLER . Editor and Prop.

THE ALABAMA TROOPS.
Governor Henderson Will Ask Govern
ment to Send Them Home.
Governor Henderson of Ala
bama, who has been here invest
igating the conditions of the
Alabama guardsmen, now sta
tioned at Nogales, before taking
his departure for Douglas, to in
spects the troops at that place,
issued the following report:
"At the present time Alabama
has 4,955 guardsmen on the bor
der. One brigade of infantry
located at Nogales, two batteries
of artillery at Douglas, Arizona,
and one regiment of cavalry at
San Antonio, Texas. The brig
ade of infantry arrived at Noga
les from October 22 to 29. There
has been an unusual amount of
sickness in the Nogales camp
and the various reports sent out
caused me to visit the camp for
the purpose of ascertaining the
present status and the cause
leading up to this condition. I
have been through the field and
base hospitals, I have visited
headquarters, talked with bri
gade, regimental and company
officers and with many of the
enlisted men. Every facility ha.s
been offered me to ascertain not
only the present conditions, but
a complete history of all matters
pertaining to the welfare of the
Alabama guardsmen. The mili
tiamen are supplied with , ample
clothing, and their quarters are
boarded up and floored. Each
tent furnished with stove and
fuel.
"In talking with the enlisted
men I find no complaint of the
supplies furnished them. There
is, however, a condition of un
rest and dissatisfaction among
the men. They have been mo
bilized more than six months
three months in Alabama and
three months in Arizona. This
brigade is made up of guards
men who were members of the
organization at the time the call
was made with such additions as
were necessary to increase the
brigade to the requirements de
manded for actual service. Al
most to a man the Alabama Na
tional guardsmen took the oath
required by the army regula
tions. This was done at great
personal sacrifice. They thought
their services were needed by
heir country and they answered
the call cheerfully. They have
now trained and undergone the
inconveniences of camp life for
more than six months, and feel
that they should be relieved
from further sacrifices unless
actual hostilities should become
eminent.
"While the diplomatic negotia
tions are being drawn out slowly,
the state militia is being held in
the mobilization camps without
prospect of real service, or any
thought, it would seeui, by the
department at Washington of
their personal or material wel
fare. With no prospect of hos
tilities, six months is too long to
retain the militia in camp. Their
service will be of much greater
advantage to their country if
used in the various vocations
pursued by them before enlist
ment. Added to this is the un
certainty of the length of their
detention and the many cases of
sickness.
"The altitude of this section
and variations of temperature
are radically different from that
of Alabama. This condition de
mands the exercise of different
care on the part of the individ
ual, than that which he has been
accustomed to in Alabama.
"The fatalities with the Ala
bama brigade at Nogales from
all sources have been fourteen,
eleven of which resulted from
pneumonia. The total number
of pneumonia cases has been 66
with a mortality ratio up to this
time of 16 6 10 per cent. At
present there are twenty-nine
cases of pneumonia in the hos
pital. "The total number of cases of
all character in the base hospital
is 206, of which are the 29 cases
of pneumonia, and these are the
only cases considered of serious
nature. In the Alabama field
hospital there are 53 cases of
measles and 44 from various
other complaints, none of which
are considered serious. There is
a marked decrease in the num
ber of measle cases.
"The inspection of the quart
ers of the regulars was made by
me for the purpose of drawing a
comparison. In my opinion the
National Guard is better provid
ed for in the way of quarters,
and the comforts of life than the
regulars stationed at Nogales.
"By a careful perusal of re
cords, I am convinced that any
lack of preparations for the
rigors of winter which may have
contributed to the unusual health
conditions in the Alabama bri
gade of the National Guard is
not due to any lack of foresight
or action on the part of the of
ficers stationed at Nogales, but
to the slow methods and inac
tivity of those in control, locat
ed a thousand miles or more
distant.
"I believe the Alabama bri
gade should be returned to Ala
bama and demobilized without
delay and will ask that this be
done. I leave for Douglas to
morrow to investigate conditions
with the two companies of artil
lery stationed there.

Charles Henderson,
Gov. of the State of Alabama.

"I want to telS you what wonderful benefit I have re
ceived from the use of Thedford's Black-Draught," writes
Mrs. Sylvania Woods, of Clifton Mills, Ky.
"It certainly has no equal for la grippe, bad colds,
liver and stomach troubles. 1 firmly believe Black-Draught
saved my little girl's life. When she had the measles,
they went in on her, but one good dose of Thedford's
Black-Draught made them break out, and she has had no
more trouble. I shall never be without
m
E2
in my home." For constipation, indigestion, headache, dizzi
ness, malaria, chills and fever, biliousness, and all similar
ailments, Thedford's Black-Draught has proved itself a safe,
reliable, gentle and valuable remedy.
If you suffer from any of these complaints, try Black
Draught. It is a medicine of known merit. Seventy-five
years of splendid success proves its value. Good for
young and old. For sale everywhere. Price 25 cents.

HONOR TO DEWEY UN EQUALED.
Fitting Expression to the Nation's Af
fection and Sorrow.
Washington, Jan. 17. Fun
eral services for Admiral Dewey
giving fitting expression to the
nation's affection and sorrow and
bestowing the highest public
honors that can be givan a na
tional hero were planned by offi
cials of the government today.
It was decided to hold the pub
lic ceremonies Saturday in the
rotunda of the capitol, and to
bring to Washington, for an es
cort of honor, all available forces
of both the naval and military
arms of the service. Congress
will be in recess during the fun
eral and under an order by Pre
sident Wilson the government
departments will remain closed
during the entire day.
The president sent a special
message to congress today an
nouncing the death of the aged
Spanish war hero and declaring
that the people and the gov
ernment will always rejoice to
perpetuate his name in honor
and affection."
Both senate and house adopt
ed resolutions of regret, appoint
ed committees to represent them
at the funeral and adjourned be
fore the usual hour to emphasize
their -expressions of regret.
Under the president's order,
flags on all government build
ings, forts and naval vessels

corps wear mourning with their
uniforms for thirty days. The

signal honor been paid a dead
hero as that provided for Ad

niel's order, sent broadcast by
the Arlington wireless station to
American vessels and shore sta
tions everywhere.
"It is with a feeling of gen

PRODUCTIVE PERIOD OF THE
DAIRY COW.
Cows gradually increase in the
quantity of milk yielded with
each lactation period until the
third or fourth calf is dropped.
After this time about two or
three lactation periods remain
about the same, and then they
begin to fail off appreciably in
the amount of milk. Thus it is
seen that the most useful period
of a cow is between the third,
fourth and possibly, the sixth
calf, and it is a t;ood plan to
try to purchase cows at the be
ginning of this period and sell
them towards the end of it. Un
fortunately, the other fellow has
the advantage of milking the
cows first, and if he is an in
telligent person, he will not sell
anything but the inferior milk
ers. On this account it is often
necessary to raise one's heifers
and test them out for y our self.
Good purebrecL- cows are al
ways retained in the herd as
long as they prove satisfactory
breeders. On the other hand,
ordinary or inferior purebred
cows should be disposed of when
they are about 31 or 12 years
old, for after this time they are
not as regular breeders and it is
just possible that calves from
old cows are not as good as those
from cows in their prime of life.
In a well managed herd one can
have the cows to average a calf
at 12 or 13 months, if only ood
vigorous animals are retained.
On the other hand, in most herds
dairy cows do not average a calf
for the herd in less time than 15

raised are not an inconsiderable

FISH HATCHERY FOR ARIZONA.
The House of Representatives
has passed an Omnibus bill au
thorizing the establishment of
eighteen new fish hatcheries in
the United States. The Omnibus
bill includes a bill introduced by
Hon. Carl Harden, which pro
vides that one of these hatch
eries shall be located in Arizona,
and $50,000 is authorized to be
expended for this purpose. It
is expected that this bill will
pass the senate in the near fut
ure, so that the new Arizona
hatchery should be in operation
within the next eighteen months.
Its establishment will greatly
improve the facilities for stock
ing the ponds and streams of
Arizona with suitable varieties
of fish and thus develop a source
of food supply which should aid
in the present struggle against
the high cost of living.
It has been demonstrated that
an acre of water on a farm may
be made to equal an acre of the
best land for producing food, and
the Bureau of .Fisheries is en
deavoring to stock the minor
ponds, natural or artificial, in
order to distribute fish food as
widely as possible over the in
terior of the country Assign
ment of fish by the Bureau are
made large enough to form the
nucleus for a brood stock for a
givin are of water, and are deliv
ered at the applicant's railroad
station by special fish transport
ing cars. Pending the construct
ing of the Arizona hatchery,
fingerling fish from other hatch
eries for distribution to individ
uals for stocking public and
private waters in Arizona will be
supplied by the Bureau of Fish
eries to those who apply. Blanks
upon which to submit a formal
application for fish will be fur
nished on request by Hon. Carl
Hayden, congressman for Arizona.
GOT HIS OWN.
"Ignorance of the law excuses
no man," is an age old saying
known in the highways and
hedges of most remote America.
However, this condition came
near costing Sam Jacobs, Tuc
son stationer and lover of good
things, valuables to the extent
of $130.
Several days ago Jacobs dis
covered that $130 worth of wine
he had stored in his cellar had
disappeared. He began a search
and soon located the guilty Mex
ican. He rushed frantically to
the police station to have a
charge of the theft filed and he
says. Constable Mills told him:
'Why, you can't have that
Mexican arrested; it was against
the law for you to have that
booze iu your possession."
Two or three days later he ac
cidentally told his attorney ab
out it, and was informed that as
he had brought the wine into
the state before the rersonal use
clause was abolished he could
reclaim it. He then went to the
city hall and in a few hours the
wine was deposited in his cellar.

NEW GAME LAWS.
The new Arizona game law is
much more restrictive than the
old statue and is designed to re
stock the hills as of yore. Though
passod by the people, the meas
ure was not favored by the Ari
zona Sportsmen's association,
which pointed out that a child
who goes hunting with his father
or who fishes on the bank for
bull heads and carp now must
pay a license fee of $1 25. The
law also protects doves and
white wings up to July 15, per
mitting them to prey unmolested
upon ripening grain.
Deer and wild turkey now may
be killed only in October, with a
limit of two each; ducks and
geese, October 15 to January 13;
quail, October 15 to December
31; trout, June 1 to Sept. 1.
A hunting license will cost
$125 for residents and $20 for
others, while resident fishermen
will pay $1.25 and uon resident
$10.
The land office is received from
twenty to twenty-five applica
tions a day through the mail for
live stock homesteads under the
new law recently passed, and
have about as many more pre
sented in the office personally by
the applicants. One of the re
quisites in making these applica
tions is an accom paying petition
for designation of the land as
being subject to entry under the
law. But few applications com
ing by mail have these accom
panying petitions, and they will
have to be supplied before any
action is taken on them.
