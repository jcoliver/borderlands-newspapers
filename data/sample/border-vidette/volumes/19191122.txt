The Spirit of Friendship.
This store looks upon its patrons not
merely as customers but as friends.
People purchase here because they
have friendly feeling for this store.
The cause which develops this friendly
feeling, may differ, in fact, they are
sure to differ. One's friendship for
the store is the result of finding good
values; another's is the result of effi
cient service and courteous treatment,
and so on.
Naturally this friendshiply feeling on
the part of our patrons is reciprocated
on our part. And this spirit of mutual
friendship is an impetus for greater
service and an incentive to ever-increasing
endeavor to make this store
a place where every visitor will feel
perfectly at home.

ARIZONA NOTES.
Items of Interest Culled From Our
Exchanges.
One of the important activities
of the business of farming is in
feeding live stock for the market.
But equally important for the
present day farmer is the feed
ing and fattening of his surplus.
For like every successful busi
nessman, the successful farmer
carries a surplus outside bis
business.
Morgan McDermott Post of
the American Legion has declar
ed in favor of universal military
training. This action, taken at
the last meeting, by a vote of 59
to 43, was reversal of a vote on.
the same subject of 13 to 16 in'
the negative. Andrew P. Mar
tin, state commander, led the
fight against training.
That Thomas Maddock, state
engineer, is defying the laws of
the state with reference to the
expenditure of highway funds,
and that in so doing he is aling
ing himself with the Bolsheviki
and the I. W.W. are the charges
contained in an opinion rendered
by Attorney General Wiley E.
Jones, made public recently.
Unless present plans fall down,
a new flouring mill with a daily
capacity of twenty five barrels,
is soon to be included among the
industries of Benson. C. M.
Plumb, late of St. David, but
now living in Benson, is figuring
on the establishment of the en
terprise. He has just returned
from the Gila valley where he has
been making some investigations
into milling matters, and comes
back encouraged to go ahead.
All records for cotton prices
were declared shattered when
at eight valley gins, a price of
86s a pound for long staple cot
ton went into effect, an advance
of four cents a pound over yes
terday. The new figure repre
sented a price of $430 a bale.
According to cotton men, this
made Arizona cotton the highest
priced in the world, and 30c a
pound higher than the average
1918 price for cotton of the same
price and grade.
Another step forward in the
mining industry this week was
taken, when the Blue Lead mines
were bonded to Mr. B. P. John
ston by E. E. Bethell. Mr.
Johnston has been investigating
the Patagonia fields for some
time, and finally became satis
fied that the Blue Lead was good
enough for him. The plans of
the new lessees have not as yet
been given out, but early ac
tivities will doubtless be the re
sult of the deal. Patagonian.
On account of the increasing
value of silver it has been found
necessary to coin new money in
Mexico, according to informa
tion from Mexico City. The
present coinage of silver in Mex
ico is worth more than its face
and as a result silver coins have
been hoarded until there is a
shortage. The new coins will
contain just half the amount of
the silver as is in the corres
ponding United States coin and
will be worth just half as much.
The highway, Fairbanks to No
gales, via Patagonia, promises
to become popular with the trav
eling public. Mr. Van Franks,
who has been supervising the
location of the highway, has, it
is said, succeeded in shortening
the road to Nogales consider
ably, and, better yet, has aban
doned parts of the old river road
and laid the new line where
there is no gtade exceeding six
per cent. This means better
time, of course, and greater safe
ty and pleasure to car drivers.
Patagonian.
What is considered a top price
for leases was made the other
day when Gerard & Co. of Mesa,
leased 80 acres east of Chandler
to some Japs for $50 an acre.
The land belongs to Ellis Pew.
The lease is for three years and
amounts to $11,000 for that
length of time. The new occu
pants will raise cantaloupes and
other truck on the place. A
peculiar feature of bow land
prices move is the fact that Mr.
Pew bought this same piece of
land for the exact amount he
secures from his three year lease
11,000.

Many thousands of
women suffering from

been benefited by the use
of Cardui, the woman's
tonic, according to letters
we receive, similar to this
one from Mrs. Z. V. Spell.,
of Hayne, N. C. "I could
not stand on my feet, and
just suffered terribly,'"'
she says. "As my suf
fering was so great, and
he had tried other reme

get Cardui. . I began
improving, and it cured
me. I know, and my
doctor knows, what Car
dui did for me, for my
nerves and health were
bout gone."

She writes further: I

can do my work. I feel I
.owe it to Cardui, for I was
in dreadful condition."
If you are nervous, run
down and weak, or suffer
from headache, backache,
etc., every month, try
Cardui. Thousands of
women praise this medi
cine for the good it has
done them, and many
physicians who have used
Cardui successfully with
their women patients, for
years, endorse this medi
cine. Think what it means
to be in splendid health,
like Mrs. Spell. Give
Cardui a trial.
