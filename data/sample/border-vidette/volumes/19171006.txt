MAY BUILD -CUSTOMS SMELTER.
Representatives of Eastern Capital
Visit Rich Mining District.
As a result of the visit to
Patagonia this week of F. R.
Shaw, C. W. Daughs, represent
ing San Francisco and New
York capital, a customs smelter
to be built at Patagonia is one
of the possibilities of the very
near future. These men were
sent here to obtain options upon
some of nearby properties if
possible, and also to investigate
the feasibility of establishing a
smelter. They are now compiling
statistics of the various mines in
the Patagonia district, with
special reference to the past and
present record of producers, and
also estimating the. probable
production of many good pros
pects in the district, provided a
smelter was located here to treat
the ores. When this mass of
information has been secured
and compiled, Messrs. Shaw,
Casab and Daughs will present
it to their Eastern clients, and it
is believed favorable action will
be take upon the pioposition.
Many things combine to make
Patagonia the ideal place for the
location of a customs smelter,
some of which are the very
favorable sites, the abundance
of water, lime and iroa, all
needed for a smelter, and more
important than all, there is at
the present time enough ore
being shipped from this district,
with that which could easily be
developed, to keep a small
smelter busy in this community.
Besides treating ores from
this immediate vicinity, a smelter
in Patagonia could doubtless
secure the ores from the Rose-
mont district, now being shipped
to El Paso and other smelters,
and in times of peace in Mexico,
should be able to get much ore
from Sonora. Already the pro
duction of the district, from the
big Duquesne and Three R, with
a dozen smaller shippers, is al
most enough to keep a 500-ton
smelter going, and the output
would probably be doubled if a
smelter was built here, thus
saving the freight charges to
distant smelters.
There is a large body of fine
lime on trie Southern Pacific
tracks a few miles east of town,
also lime in the ores of some of
the mines, especially the body
of lime at the Flux mine, which
would be less than two miles
from the smelter, if built below
town at one of the most favor
able sites, where the fumes
would not interfere with farm-
ng, and where a spur track of
only a few hundred yards could
be built to connect with the rail
road .
Perhaps the high price of
silver has something to do with
the proposal to start a smelter
at Patagonia, and to be a success
the smelter would necessarily
require two stacks, one for cop
per, the other lor lead silver
ores, Uhier or tne silver pro
ducers in the district is the
famous World's Fair, but there
are many more very near town,
n the Harshaw district which in
early days vied with old Tomb
stone in the amount of lead-silver
produced.
The Hardshell and Flux mines,
within ten miles of Patagonia,
have large bodies of low-grade
lead-silver ore. It would require
a concentrator at the mines, and
then a production of 50 tons daily
ot concentrates could be made.
The Trench mine, adjoining the
Hardshell, is now down 500 feet
with a fine ledge of lead-silver
ore and should soon be turning
out 100 tons daily. The Morning
Glory, near the Hardshell and
Trench, has a fine body of cop
per and silver ore, with a zinc
ledge in the same mine. The old
Mowry will soon be opened by
the owners. It has large bodies
of lead-silver ore with a great
record of production in the early
days. It is 13 miles from Pata
gonia, with a good wagon road
from th.e mine, all down grade.
The old Hermosa, Blue Nose and
American, all near the Hard
shell, would all go to producing
with a smelter at or near Pata
gonia. All three nave good re
cords as producers, mostly of
silver, with some lead.
The Alta, adjoining the Hard
shell, an old mine with a good
record, has produced rich silver
ore, .some lead and some copper,
with a little zinc, would also
start producing with a smelter
nearby. The Weiland and Coch
ran properties, situated eight
miles south of Patagonia, with
lead, silver and copper ores,
would commence working at
once with a smelter in the neigh
borhood. The Three R. mine, 8 miles
southwest of town, a straight
copper proposition, has 75 men
working. It has a fine concen
trator, and expects soon to be
treating 200 tons daily, putting
about 8 in to 1. The Arizona
European, adjoining the Three
R. on the south, has 15 men
working on a fine showing of
high gradfe silver and copper.
The Wandering Jew mine, 14
miles northwest of Patagonia,
has just completed a small con
centrator and is putting through
about 25 tons of ore daily, turn
ing out about four tons of con
centrates, lead, silver and cop
per. The McDonald mine (Pinal)
11 miles north of here, has about
25 men working, with a fine
showing of high grade copper
and silver. The deepest working
is only about 250 feet, on a fine
body of ore, from which a car is
shipped about once a week.
Many other mines would start
up and produce from one to ten
tons daily with a smelter at or
near Patagonia. Ores from mines
south of Tucson could be shipped
to a smelter here by a 40 to 60
mile haul; thousands of tons are
shipped from that country to El
Paso, Douglas, Hayden and
Sasco, that would have one third
the" hauld to a smelter at Pata
gonia. Patagonian.

Whereas, It is necessary for
the United States to raise, during
this, the first year of our War
with Germany, eighteen and
one half billions of dollars, or
about forty-seven of each one
hundred dollars that we earn;
Whereas. Our Government
must get this astounding amount
either by taxation of the people
or by borrowing from them and
is seeking through the sale of
Liberty Bonds, to obtain a part
of this huge sum with which to
carry on our share of the conflict
arfd provide means for our allies
to prosecute a tight which must
be won, if world democracy shall
survive:
Now Therefore, I, Thomas
E. Campbell. Governor of Ari
zona, under the authority in me
vested, do hereby urge upon all
those firms, companies, corpora
tions and citizens, who are
financially able to bear a share
of this burden, to subscribe as
liberally as possible to the
second issue of Liberty Bonds of
the United States which is offer
ed to the public, beginning
October first. 1917, and would
direct special attention to the
following facts in regard thereto
We are in this- War; we must
win and to do it, the money must
be found.
The more the Government will
allow you to loan to it, the less
you will be taxed; ease taxation
by buying a Liberty Bond.
Money is wasted on unneces
saries in our Country which, if
loaned to it, might turn scale to
Victory and save thousands of
precious lives.
Economize and save. Extrava
gance must stop.
When you buy a Lberty Bond;
you have what is as good as
money, to borrow on or to sell
and it pays good interest.
Taxes are a dead expense; they
never come back; they pay no
interess. You must be taxed if
you will not buy;
The civilized world is fighting,
that Right! may prevail and that
the world be made safe for
honest people to live in. Our
boys are giving their lives; our
allies, their lives and money, and
the least we can do is to support
their efforts.
Do your share. Duty demands
it, common sence advises it and
your Government expects it.
In Witness Whereof. I have
hereunto set my band and
caused the Great Seal of the
State of Arizona to be affixed.

tional army, which is designated
of those now training at Camp
Funston, Fort Riley, Kan. .where
the Arizona young men have
been sent, are to have plenty of
work to do in preparing for the
greater work in France, the re
creation side is not to be neglect
ed by the government.
According to information which
has reached Phoenix, there is to
be a small city constructed in
the very center of Camp Funs
ton, where amusements and bus
iness houses of all kinds will be
erected. Major Harry Howland
of the regular army has been,
placsd in charge of the building
of this White Way, as it already
has been designated.
There are to be, according to
present plans, Y. M. C. A., an
auditorium, department store,
postoffice, express office, tele
phone office, bank, newspaper
building, vaudeville theatre, mov
ing picture show, a theater to
be used by a stock company, re
staurant, lunch stands, shoe
shining rooms, barber shops.
Turkish bath houses, laundry
office, shooting galleries, bowl
ing and billiard halls, photo
graph studio, and many other
activities.
All of these are to be conduct
ed by civilians under the super
vision of the officials of the divi
sion, a certain per cent of the
profits to go to the regimental
funds. Also the officials will see
that proper prices are charged
for everything to be for sale in
this White City.
PROSPECTORS' SHORT COURSE.
A PROSPECTIVE OPTIMIST.
(Washington Star:) "I'm sur
prised to find you working over
a gun," commented the gentle
stranger at Crimson Gulch. .
"Well." replied Broncho Bob
"Three-fingered Sam is on a
rampage and he has drooped
some hints that he is particularly
irritated against me."
"But you ought to be an op
timist." "What's an optimist?"
"An optimist is a man who
smiles and believes that every
thing will turn out for the best."
"Well, I ain't an optimist this
minute, but I will be as soon as
I get this old 45 oiled an' some
cartridges into her.
The Short Course for pros
pectors and miners offered by
the University of Arizona at
Tucson this winter will extend
over a period of ten weeks, from
October 15th to December 22nd,
inclusive. It will include laborat

tests for all the important metals,
how to recognize valuable min
erals and common rocks at sight,
how to make assays for gold,
silver, copper, and lead, and
how to lay out mining claims and
to use transit and level for other
purposes. The geological work
will cover the origin, occurrence,
and characteristics of all classes
I of ore deposits, special attention
being given to outcrop features
and facts useful in prospecting.
This course is designed prim
arily for mature studeuts. The
only entrance requirements are

TEXANS HUNTING GRASS.
The drouth in parts of Texas,
has resulted in a rush for the
national forest ranges of Arizona
in an effort to save the cattle be
fore it is too late to move them.
Applications for space in the
forest reserves have deluged the
local forest headquarters. All
have been firmly refused, even
when evidence of luxurious
growth was given.
"That grass is thick, it is
true," was the general reply,
"but it is the last grass of the
season and there will be no more
this year. We must protect the
cattle already on the ranges."
In the section from Tucson to
the line, the grass has been ex
ceptionally good this year owing
to the heavy rains. There is an
abundance of cattle and they are
fatening. Arizona Cattleman.

More Sons to Battle.
Everybody turned out last
Wednesday afternoon to bid the
Nogales and Santa Cruz county
boys good-bye on their depart
ure for Camp Punston, to join
the forty-three other boys who
preceded tnem in the first and
second increments.
The thirty-eight boys compris

Santa Cruz county, who were
sent off with flying colors, cheers
and martial music ringing in
their eats, were the equal of any
in the National Army. Many of
them from our oldest, best fami
lies, and hundreds of relatives
and friends were present to wish
them "Good bye, good luck, and
a sale return."
As the long parade, headed
.by Grand Marshal Mix, follow
ed by the 35th Infantry band
and a company of soldiers, fol
lowed by the Boy Scouts, hun
dreds of citizens, acting as an
escort of honor to the brave
thirty-eight, and hundreds of
school children, passed through
the streets to the private car in
which the boys made the trip to
Camp Punston, hearty cheers
were given them by thousands
who wished them god-speed.
When Chairman Earhart of
the local selection board, called
the names of Edward Titcomb
John Jund, Joe Mclntyre, Car
los Joffroy, Pete Em brick. Geo
Sullivan, Grover Polk, Myron
McCarty, David Jones, Blanton
Taylor Wilkey and other well
known, popular young men of
this county, they answered
here," and at once took their
places in the car, while their
friends applauded, and the band
played patriotic music.
The places of those who failed
to report were promptly filled
by alternates, and when the
train pulled out, Santa Cruz
connty for the third time had
done her duty to her country, by
sending many of her bravest
and best sons to fight for the
grandest nation the world has
ever known, the United States
of America.

Corn Pain
Stopped Quick
Corns Lift Bight Off With "Gets-It"
Blessed relief from corn pains is
simple as ABO with "Gets-It."
When you've been limping around
tor days trying to get away from
a heart -drilling corn or bumpy cal
lus, and everything you've tried ha
only made it worse, and then you
put some "Gets-It" on and the pain
oases right away, and the corn peels
right oft like a banana skin
"ain't it a grand and heavenly feel
ing?" I
"Gets-It" has revolutionized the
corn history of the world. Millions
use it and it never fails. Ladies
wear smaller shoes and have pain
free feet. We old fellows and
young fellows forget our toes and
feel frisky as colts. Everybody
with a corn or callus needs "Gets
It." We will all walk about and
enjoy ourselves as we did without
corns. Get a bottle today from your
druggist, or sent on receipt of price
by E. Lawrence & Co., Chicago, III.,
25c is all you need to pay. .

ARIZONA POTATO MAGNATES.
Potato grrowers in the Salt
River Valley will no longer be
known as ranchers, bat rather
potato magnates, if all deals in
potatoes this season grade up
like one put through today by
John Schlalo, a potato magnate
of Glendale, according to the
Phoenix Gazete. This potato
magnate has twnnty-two acres
planted to potatoes in -great
demand, there being buyers on
hand to grab up the crop and
ship it away. Along came a
buyer and made Schlalo an offer,
cash for every potato in his
twenty two acres. His crop was
checked and it was found, at
three and one-half cents a pound,
the price paid, he had just $10,
700 due him from the buyer.
This amounted to $486.40 an
acre. Schlalo figured again to
see how much he had cleared on
his twenty two acres. Operating
expenses, including planting and
all oyerhead costs, amounted to
$80 and a few cents. The potato
magnate's profit was therefore
something over $100 an acre.
From 44,000 dairy cows in
Arizona at the end of 1913, the
number had increased to 81,000
at the end of 1916, and it is
estimated that the number will
be increased to 90,000 by the end
of 1917, an increase of more
than 100 per cent in four years.
Arizona dairymen claim this is
a record which connot be beaten
by any other state. The explana
tion is simple. Dairying is most
profitable where the winters are
mild, and Where protein, the
most expensive element in the
ration of the dairy cow, can be
procured the cheapest. In the
Salt River Valley, where three
fourths of the dairy cattle of
Arizona are found, the winters
mild and a high grade of alfalfa
is produced at a low cost. The
Board of Trade of Phoenix and
the Commercial Men's Associa
tion of Glendale have issued a
pamphlet giving details about
dairying in the Salt River
Valley. Post.
