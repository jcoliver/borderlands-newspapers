ANOTHER FEDERAL JUOGE.
Now that the war is over, a
determined effort is to be made
in congress at the short session
to put the bill creating an addi
tional judicial district in Arizona
through the house of represent
ati ves.
The bill has already passed
the senate. It is reposing in the
judiciary committee of the house
along witn a lot, oi otner similar
bills creating new judicial dis
tricts. The new district has been re
commended by Judge W. H.
Sawtelle, United States district
judge for Arizona. It would
provide an additional judge and
Arizona would be divided into
two districts with Phoenix as
headquarters for the northern
district. A gieat deal of the
federal business originates in
the southern counties and along
the border.
It is understood that Henry D.
Ross, judge of the supreme
court, is slated for appointment
as the new federal judge in case
the bill passes. His term will
not expire until 1922 and the
vacancy will be filled by ap
pointment of the governor.
Others mentioned for the ap
pointment are Geo. J. Stoneman
of Phoenix and C H. Ruther
ford of Jerome. Prospector.
Among the horrors of

FAMOUS PAINTER IN ARIZONA.
All the way from Toronto to
Phoenix to paint a picture of
Governor George VV. P. Hunt of
Arizona has come John Wycliffe
Lodes Forster, historical painter
of international reputation, ac
cording to the Arizona Repub
lican.
Mr. Forster has painted por
traits of such notables as Lord
Roberts, Earl Gray, Admiral
Strauss, Secretary McAdoo and
practically all the leaders in
Canadian public life. Mr. For
ster has come also to enjoy the
Arizona sunsets, says the Re
publican, and adds, anent the
prospective portrait of Governor
Hunt, evidently already in pro
cess of construction:
"The painter has visited the
state house several times, and,
of course, anyone observing
might have seen startling real
istic sketches, but they are only
rough beginnings."
PORT SAN FERNANDO.
The opening of the port of
San Fernando, near Sasabe,
which has been authorized by
the Department of Labor, will
greatly facilitate traffic and im
prove trade relations between
Tucson and the Altar district of
Sonora, according to Inspector-in-Cbarge
A. E. Burnett of the
United States immigration sta
tion. The new port will be in
this jurisdiction, as will the new
port of Ajo.
The San Fernando port will
be open to traffic as soon as im
migration officers can be placed
there. The staff will consist of
two inspectors. Quarters for the
inspectors and a customs office
will also have to be supplied.

Will
Lieut. Frank Luke of Phoenix
has been awarded the gold me
dal offered by Miss Margaret
Fisher of the American Film
company to the first Rockwell
Field aviator to bring down a
German plane. Announcement
of this was made at Rockwell
Field.
Lieutenant Luke won the me
dal by the narrow margin of five
days from Major Carl Spatz, a
veteran North Island trained
airman. Luke crashed his first
Hun plane September 12, a short
distance northwest of Verdun.
Major Spatz downed his first
Hun, a siuele-seated Fokker,
September 17, five miles south
west of Metz.
According to a letter received
from the commander of the pur
suit squadron to which Lieuten
ant Luke was attached, the
dashing Arizona pursuit pilot is
officially credited with destroy
ing 14 airplanes and 25 balloons.
Before he was posted as missing
following a fight over the Ger
man lines on September 26,
Luke was rated as America's
premier ace by the United States
air forces in France.
Lieutenant Luke won his re
serve military aviator license at
North Island February 1 and
sailed for France in March. At
North Island he showed excel
lent promise as a pursuit pilot,
and upon arrival in France was
immediately assigned to one of
America's free-lance aerial fight
ing squadroos. Luke's subse
quent achievements in the air
won him the Croix de Guerre
and the Distinguished Service
Cross.
Miss Fisher made the gold
medal offer to North Island train
ed aviators shortly after the out
break of the war. Lieutenant
Luke is reported by his wing
mates to have been taken pris
oner after he fell inside the Ger
man lines on September 29. In
event that it is found that he
had been killed, the Margarita
Fisher medal will be sent to bis
father at Phoenix.
WILL RESUME ROAD WORK.
All restrictions in the matter
of road work are off, according
to official notification received
here by State Engineer B. M.
Atwood from the United States
Highway Counc'l. Where ap
proval of projects has been de
nied the former action is re
scinded, and where applications
are pending the work may pro
ceed without further notice.
Bond issues, however, still are
under control of the capital is
sues committee. Where bond is
sues are sought for road con
struction permits for the issuance
and sale of bonds mu.st be se
cured. Thou;h applications for steel
must be made subject to the
government's requirements, the
state engineer has been assured
he will be furnished all the steel
the state will need for road con
struction. Arizona's Machine Gun School.
Orders have been received at
district headquarters from the
Southern department to estab
lish a Machine Gun school at
Fort Huachuca for line officers
of the Arizona district. It will
open not later than December 2,
and last eight weeks, being con
ducted on the same lines as the
one at Fort Bliss.
It will be under the supervi
sion of Col. C. C. Smith of the
Tenth cavalry, Capt. Francis N.
Boucher of the 17th cavalry be
ing in immediate command. He
will have as assistants four
graduates of the Machine Gun
school at Fort Bliss. Attending
the school will be eight student
officers from each of the follow
ing regiments: Twenty-fifth in
fantry, First cavalry. Tenth cav
alry and Seventeenth cavalry.
These officers will be men who
expect to remain in the army.
In issuing the order, Ma j. Gen.
D. C. Cabell, commander of the
department, explains that with
demobilization many officers will
have to expect to be reduced in
rank.
Through the passage by ma
jority vote in the election of a
legislative redisricting amend
ment (N"o. 102,) to the state con
stitution, it is believed there has
been attained a much nearer ap
proach to equality of county and
community representation than
ever before known in Arizona.
The amendment leaves to the
counties the same senatorial re
presentation as at present, to be
elected "at large," as at present,
and provides also "that no coun
ty shall have a smaller number
of representatives than that to
which it is now entitled." Two
senators each will be elected by
Cochise, Gila, Maricopa and Ya
vapai counties, all other counties
having only one each.
Hereafter each county will
have in the state house of rep
resentatives a member for each
1500 votes, or major fraction
thereof, cast in such county for
the office of governor at the last
preceding general election. Di
vision of each county into repre
sentative districts shall be done
by the board of supervisors,
each district to be balanced in
population with its neighbors as
closely as possible.
It now appears evident that
the strength ot 35 in the coming
house will be increased to 40 in
its successors. Maricopa coun
ty will gain three members. At
present it has six, contrasted
with seven from Cochise, which
has 5500 fewer registered voters.
It appears probable that Ya
vapai will remain with four
members, Pima with three and
Gila with three. Pinal and Co
conino are due to raise to two
each. Graham, Greenlee, Pinal
and Yuma remain at two each
and Apache, Mohave, Navajo
aud Santa Cruz at one each.
Colter Congratulates Campbell.
The following telegrams were
exchanged between Governor
elect Thomas E. Campbell and
Senator Fred. T. Colter:
Hon. Thomas E. Campbell,
Fleming Building,
Phoenix, Arizona.
My Dear Mr. Campbell The
official returns from the boards
of supervisors of the various
counties, as published in the
press, would indicate that on
November 5, you were elected
to the high office of governor
of Arizona. If these returns are
certified as correct by the secre
tary of state, as I assume they
will be, I take pleasure at this
time in congratulating you most
heartily upon your election. In
my entire public career I have
tried to be unselfish in working
for the best interests of Arizona,
regardless of politics or personal
feelings, and my one desire at
the present time is that in this
great era of reconstruction and
post war activities every impetus
be given to the real progress of
Arizona. In assuring you that
it is always my desire to co
operate in everything that is for
real betterment of Arizona, I am
sure that I am also voicing the
sentiments ot those who so un
selfihly assisted me in the cam
paign. Very sincerely yours,
(Signed) Fred. T. Colter.
Campbell Acknowledges Receipt.
Hon. Fred. T. Colter,
North Central Avenue,
Phoenix, Arizona.
My Dear Senator Colter Your
good favor of even date, deliver
ed by messenger, tendering your
hearty congratulations upon my
election to the office of governor,
just received. I acknowledge
same and I wish to express my
sincere thanks to you for the
unselfish and manly sentiments
expressed therein, and I want
to, at this time, accept your
tender of co operation and help
for a real betterment of the pre
sent conditions of affairs in our
beloved and native state. To
the same end do I dedicate my
whole service. Assuring you of
my high personal regard and
esteem, I am
Cordially and sincerely,

WAR SAVINGS STAMPS.
What They Are, What Th-y Mean,
What They Bring.
Thrift Stamps and Baby Bonds
are little things in themselves
but in the aprreirate. if the hope
and expectation of the Treasury
Department is reached, they will
equal in revenue producing pow
er one of the Liberty loans.
More than that. They will have
inculcated in many homes thrift
that thrift which has helped
so largely to win the war.
Obviously all people may not
own Liberty bonds and, equally
obviously, the smaller investors
wish to help the government in
its time of need, to help it in
proportion to their means. That
is why Thrift Stamps and Baby
Bonds were originated, to en
able all, rich and poor, to aid in
the war. To give the people of
more moderate means the ad
vantage the War Savings Stamps
were made the finest of all the
investments offered by the gov
ernment, the easiest to buy, the
easiest to pay for and the easiest
to sell. They are such fine in
vestment that the amount any
one individual may buy is limit
ed to $1,000. If there were not
such a limit the very rich would
take all there were because of
the investment advantages of
fered. To make them easy to handle
a unit system was devised. The
Thrift Stamp costs but 25 cents
and 16 of the stamps plus a few
pennies buys a Baby Bond which
on January 1, 1923, becomes
worth $5, though when bought
it does not cost that much. It
is the interest the government
pays from date of purchase to
date of maturity (January 1,
1923) which makes an invest
ment of $1.22 in November or
4.23 in December worth $5 after
four years. Thus 16 stamps
costing 25 cents each or $4 for
the whole 16 with 22 cents add
ed in November or 23 cents
added in December will produce
at the liberal rate of interest for
such class of investment which
is allowed by the government,
$5, in four years.
It was figured that on an aver
age each person would take $20
worth of these War Savings
Stamps or Baby Bonds, as they
are popularly known. In Ari
zona but one county so far has
met this expectation and some
counties have not as yet aver
aged $5 per person.
Thrift Stamps and Baby Bonds
are really just the same as so
much money. They can be re
gistered at the postoffice and
then only the real owner may
cash them but if they are not
registered anyone holding them
can go to any postoffice and on
10 days notice receive for them
in cash the money they cost. In
the case of the larger stamps,
the Baby Bonds, not only will
the bolder get back bis money
but he will get it back with in
terest as well. Thus the stamps
are really the same as cash with
the additional advantage that
the bigger stamps bear interest
while cash in the pocket does
not..
With the approach of peace
people may ask what is the need
of continuing the sale of War
Savings Stamps. Even with
final peace, which will not be
signed for some months, a large
army will have to be maintained
to see that the terms of peace
may be carried out. The cost of
the war will be felt for years
and War Savings Stamps will
help to foot the bill for winning
the war for a long time to come.
Every method of raising revenue
will have to be used, just as it
has been used during the actual
fighting. There will be at least
one more Liberty loan, heavy
taxation and Thrift Stamps for
a future period the duration of
which is not yet known, for an
army and navy must be main
tained for an indefinite period.
All experts are agreed in this.
You can lighten the burden of
taxation, help pay the bills for
winning the war and stand so
lidly back of your government
by purchasing Thrift Stamps
and Baby Bonds now just as in
in the time of battle.

hotel man, is a visitor in the

THANKSGIVING
DINNER IS
FOOD ADMINISTRATOR RiORDAN
SUGGESTS NOVEL IDEA FOR
CELEBRATION.
Thanksgiving, 1918, will be the
greatest in all history. This year this
memorable day set aside, oi old, lor
rejoicing and thanksgiving will be
made trebly significant through
events of victory and peace. So de
clares Timothy a. Rio r dan, federal
food administrator for Arizona, who is
exceptionally anxious that the occa
sion be celebrated in the new spirit of
American thrift.
To tbis end he sugg'-sls an all-Ari
Bona rnanksgiTing; every item of
which shall represent loiiie Arizona
1 1
product fud urges t'.at all house
holders said all public eating houses
join in the movement as a demonstra
tion to the world that Arvona is self
supporting.
By a state-wide adoption of this
plan, it is pointed out. thousands of
dollars will be saved v.'hich otherwise
would have been speat in transporta
tion of food commodities from other
riates.
There is p'enty of turkey in Ari
zona; Arizona turkeys are the fattest
and best flavored in the land. Yes,
and chickens too, instead of beef and
pork which arc needed for shipment;
plenty of gravy to save bill tor for ship
ment; wild rabbit and other game for
those who arc fortunate enough to
have them.
Pies will need only one crust filled
deep with fruit and vegetables. Cran
berries are taboo; current, grape and
apple jellies will take their place; na
tive nuts and cactus candy will round
out the menu.
Hotel and restaurant men through
out the state have pledged their sup
port in making the plan a success as
far as public eatint houses are con
cerned. Many of them have specified
their willingness to serve the official
Thanksgiving menu suggested by the
food administration, which is an fol
lows ;
Arizona Grape Fruit Supreme.
Cream of chicken.
Arizona Bine Ribbon Celery
Arizona Ripe Olives.
Chicken Patties.
Roast Salt River Valley Turkey.
Roast Salt River Valley Goose.

Arizona Currant Jelly.
Arizona Baked Apple.
Flagstaff Baked Potatoes.
Arizona Fried Kgg Plant.
Arizona Fruit Salad.
Tempe Fresh Date Pudding Orange
Sauce.
Arizona Almond Ice Cream.
Arizona Cream Cheese and Crispettes.
Arizona households have not been
forgotten and all loyal families are
expected to plan an all-Arizona
Thanksgiving dinner. The home eco
nomics division of the Food Adminis
tration has prepared a number of
menus to aid the housewife.
The first of these suggestions is a
dinner based on conservation lines
and yet suitable to households who
desire an elaborate dinner. It Is as
follows :
Arizona Fruit Cocktail.
Roast Turkey a la Maricopa.
Coconino Potatoes Patriotic.
The Vegetable Allies; Cochise Car
rots and Pima Peas Entrenched
in Apache Sauce.
Santa Cruz Milo Maize Biscuits.
Yavapai Apple Jelly.
Gila Tomato Salad Greenlee Garnish.
Graham Sandwiches.

Mohave Des (s) ert Navajo Nuggets
Cactus Candy Deglet Noor Dates
Special Envoy From Hawaii: Coffee
Demitasse.
A simpler bill of fare; quite as ap
petizing but not so elaborate as that
given above, is as follows:
Roast Duck With Potato Stuffing.
Mashed Sweet Potatoes
Creamed Onions.
Corn Muffins. Pickled Peaches.
Head Lettuce.
Pumpkin Pie. Cottage Cheese Balls.
The receipt for potato stuffing given
In the above menu is as follows:
Potato Stuffing - Two cupfuls
mashed potatoes; y cupful diced
celery; 1- teaspoon salt; teaspoon
white pepper; Vi teaspoon paprika;
few grains cayenne; 1 teaspoon sage;
1 tablespoon fat; enough hot mlk to
hold mixture together; combine all in
gredients and use as bread stuffing.
May be used with any fowl but is es
pecially good with duck or goose. .
To make cottage cheese balls the
following receipt is given:
Season cottage cheese with salt and
paprika or omit paprika and use fine
ly chopped pimientos. Add enough
cream to make a mixture that can be
moulded into balls.
Because of the diminishing of the
herds, Europe will face serious food
shortages for years after peace is
achieved. U. S. f ood Administration.
Your grocer is pledged to full co
operation in the food administration
program. Are you helping him to
keep that pledge?

received here by Frank Luke,
the father, that the daring young
lieutenant was killed in action

Luke was first reported as miss
ing, and for a long time hope
was held that he might be a
prisoner in Germany.
The message received here
was from the bureau of commu
nication of th9 American Red
Cross, lo states as its authority
a report coming out of Germany
from the International Red
Cross, and adds that these re
ports are invarfiably to be trust
ed. The American Red Cross
office in Paris, nevertheless, is
vigorously continuing investiga
tions in the faint hope that the
report of the airman's death may
prove unfounded.
Lieutenant Luke was last seen

the American lines in search of
German balloons, of which he
had always made a special prey.
Luke was credited with bringing
down 15 Hun planes and bal
loons in less than six weeks.

ering of the tax rate to 3D cents
on $100 was made possible by
increased valuation of mines,
which valuation is the result of
increased production. Without
mines, and to keep the State
with many advantages which it
now enjoys in educational facili

"I suffered with bearing

that when i would start to

nearly fall. Vas very
much run-down. I tcld

Cardui would help me. ..
lie got nib a bottle. . . It
helped me so much that
he got me another bottle.
I got a whole 1st better.
The dizzy spells and the
bearing-down pains ...
left me entirely."

ing Cardui a thorough
trial. It is composed of
mild, vegetable, ciedici-
ri ta nai ingredients, recog
nized by standard meci
cal books for many years,
as being ci great value in
the troubles from which
only women suffer. The
enthusiastic praise of the
thousands cf women who
have been helped by
Cardui in its pact 40 years
of successful use should
assure ycu of its genuine
merit, and convince yen
that i would be worth
