ARIZONA
The Democrats of Arizona, in
party council assembled, adopt
the following declartions to the
end that the people of the state
may be appraised of the policies
to which the party is committed:
1. The immediate purpose of
the Democratic party, the pur
pose which takes precedence of
every other, is to win the war.
The fate of true Democracy
everywhere depends upon its be
ing won. Its object is to rid the
world once for all of the threat
of violence and injustice which
must hang over it so long as
there is anywhere an autocratic
government which can disturb
its peace or dominate its for
tunes. The outrages against
right which Germany has com
mitted have directly touched our
own citizens and our own libert
ies, and they have done much
more than that. They have
threatened right and liberty
everywhere, and Germany must
be brought to terms by such o
victory as will leave no doubt in
the minds of her rulers and her
people as to what forces control
mankind. We entered upon our
present course in self defense to
resist a menacing assault, di
rected against our freedom and
our national integrity; we shall
not abandon it until our object
ive is definitely attained.
2. Because we mean to win
the war.it is our purpose to sup
port and sustain to the utmost
the administration of Woodrow
Wilson. His administration can
be better supported by those
who believe in it and trust it
than by those who are constant
ly eager to make a selfish use of
what they conceive to be its mis
takes. It is, therefore, our pur
pose to supply the administra
tion in our nominees with men
who are its real and unquestion
able friends.
3. We are confirmed and
strengthened in our support of
the administration, and are in
full harmony with it, not merely
b3cause we are at war and must
stand behind the only common
instrumentality through which
we can win it, but also because
the administration has deserved
our confidence by its record.
4. Our purposes look beyond
the period of the war. We re
cognize that the war must of ne
cessity be followed by a period
of reconstruction, to whose prob
lems it will be necessary that
the best, most sympathetic and
most liberal minds of the country
should be devoted. These prob
lems will some of them be new,
and manv of them, though old
problems, will wear a new aspect
and significance. They must be
aDoroached without regard to
old party catchwords, formulas
or prepossessions, in full recog
nition of the fact that they are
new and must be dealt with in a
new way. Many thousands,
perhaps a million, of our sol
diers will return with health im
paired, necessitating their em
ployment in suitable occupations
under climatic conditions favor
able to convaleni-ence. The
wonderful climate of the great
Southwest can best give this
aid, and of the southwestern
states Arizona is most bounti
fully equipped by-nature to play
a remedial part, freparauons
should be made by this state to
meet its obligation, and to give
employment' to our health im
paired soldiers. The wasting
waters of our torrential streams
should be harnessed to furnish
power for the great plants which
will arise for the refining of our
copper one-third or the nation s
production of that metal and
for its transformation into arti
cles of commerce, and for the
reclamation of our arid lands,
which will mean an inestimable
increase of agricultural products
and the essentials of life, more
factories and many industries.
We, theiefore, favor legislation
which will enable Arizona to
discharge its duty in this re
spect, and to co operate to the
fullest extent in the plan pro
posed by Honorable Franklin K.
Lane, Secretary of the Interior,
to care for our return soldiers.
5. As full a development as
possible of vocational training
must be undertaken, particular
attention being given to the re
habilitation of those who have
been in one way or another dis
abled by the war. Opportuni
ties for their industrial employ
ment must be sought and found
and they must be equipped to
take advantage of those oppor
tunities.
0. And not in their case alone
must the sympathetic aid of the
federal government be given to
the allocation of labor, the de
veloptuent of its skill and the
establishment of proper labor
conditions, but such services
must be rendered all laborers
and a systematic effjrt must be
made to raise the whole level of
the labor conditions and facili
tate the access of labor to em
ployment and the improvement
of its preparation and training.
7. We must seek to avoid in
the future the conflicts between
capital and labor which have
been all too frequent in the past,
and must seek to do so by meas
ures of co ordination. The
statesmanship of the country
must be devoted to this funda
mental and all important task
whose successful working out is
a condition precedent to har
monious democracy. Provision
must be made for the settlement
of all questions upon a single
basis of fairness and justice.
In the meantime we urge capital
and labor alike to submit such
differences as may arise to joint
conferences of their chosen rep
resentatives for peaceful solu
tion by agreement, or to the
mediation of federal officers for
adjustment with equal justice to
both classes.
- 8. The whole industry of the
country must be dealt with in
the most liberal and enlightened
manner. Arid and waste lands
must be reclaimed and agricult
ure in general further sustained
and encouraged. New indust
ries must be fostered and the
barriers removed which have
stood in the way of old ones, and
the thought of the nation devot
ed to every important processs
by which the industrial prosper
ity of the country may be se
cured, by methods which will
absolutely exclude monopoly.
The national administration
has proved itself constructive in
war as well as in peace. The
first Wilson administration
wrought the greatest civil re
forms of a century, successfully
meeting the most dimcuit pro
blems. In the President s
sec-
ond administration he encount
ers the present vast undertak
ing in which we have pledged in
thrilling unison our fortune and
our lives. Whether as the pro
gressive spokesman of industrial
and political advancement in do
mestic affairs, or as the militant
world-leader in humanity's war
for Democratic ideals, Mr. Wil
son commands our commence
and support. He is entitled to
the generous cooperation of men
of progress and vision wherever
found, and especially in theCon
erress of the United States. The
nation has traveled far under
his leadership and it cannot haz
ard the gains founded in equal
and exact principles of economic
and social justice made for Am
ericans and America institutions,
through changes whereby we
would be forced to turn to divid
ed counsels at this important
juncture. The future presents
the supreme test of American
statesmanship, aud we submit
that the people can best trust
the wisdom of President Wilson
and those who stand with him
who have shared with him the
unparalleled accomplishments of
the last six years.
Therefore, we commend to the
serious consideration of the peo
ple the election of senators and
congressmen in complete har
mony with the fresident, prim
arily upon the policies of the
war, but equally in accord with
him in questions of vital domes
tic concern. Upon this ground
we appeal for popular support
for our congressional nominee
as the man best equipped to
serve the national interests.
We earnestly endorse and com
mend the services of our three
Democratic members of Con
gress, Hon. Mark Smith, Hon.
Henry F. Ashurst and Hon. Carl
Hayden, in their loyal support

German Autocracy Must Go Before
Peace Comes, Says Wilson.
Washington, Oct. 14. Presi
dent Wilson today informed Ger
many that the only conditions
upon which an armistice can be
granted is that all atrocities on
land and sea must cease.
"When the time to consider
an armistice comes, the military
advisers of the United States
and its allies will be consulted
and no military advantage of the
armies fighting the central pow
ers will be lost."
The President also gave no
tice that autocracy must go be
fore final peace comes.
The text of the President's
answer follows:
"The unqualified acceptance
by the present German govern
ment and by a large majority of
the Reichstag of the terms laid
down by the President in an ad
dress to congress, on January
8th and in his subsequent ad
dress, justifies the President in
making a frank and direct state
ment of his decision regarding
the communication of the Ger
man government of October 8th
and 12th.
"It must be clearly understood
that the process of evacuation
and the conditions of an armis
tice are matters which must be
left to the judgment and advice
of the military advisers of the
United States and the Allied
governments, and the President
feels it his duty to say that no
arrangements can be accepted
by the government of the United
States which does not provide,
absolutely, satisfactory guards
and guarantees, which can be
given in their fundamental mat
ter of the maintenance of the
present military supremacy of
the armies of LTnited States and
its allies in the field.
"He feels confident he can
safely assume that this will be
also the judgment and decision
of the Allied governments.
"The President feels it is, al
so, his duty to add, that neither
the government of the United
States, nor, he is quite sure, the
governments with which the gov
ernment of United States is as
sociated as a belligerent, will
consent to consider an armistice
so long as the armed forces of
Germany continue the illegal
and in humane practices which
they still persist in.
"It is indispensable that the
governments associated against
Germany should know beyond
pread venture, with whom they
are dealing. The President will
make a separate reply to the
government of Austria Hungary.
"At the very time that the
German government approaches
the government of the United
States with proposals of peace
its submarines rare engaged in
sinking not passenger 6hips
alone but every boat in which
their passengers and crew seek
to make their way to safety, and
in their enforced withdrawal
from Flanders and France the
German armies are pursuing
their course of wanton destruc
tion which has always been re
garded as a direct violation of
rules and practice of civilized
warfare. Cities and villages, if.
not destroyed, are being strip
ped of all they contain, not only,
but often of their very inhabit
ants. Nations associated against
Germany cannot be expected to
agree to a cessation of arms
while a lot of inhumanity, in
spoilation and desolation is being
continued which they justly look
upon with horror and burning
hearts.
"It is necessary in order that
there may be no possibility of
misunderstanding that the Pre
sident should very solemnly call
the attention of the government
of Germany to the language, and
plain intent, of one of the terms
of peace, which the German gov
ernment has now accepted, con
tained in an address by the Pre
sident, delivered at Mount Ver
non on the Fourth of July last
as follows: 'The destruction of
every arbitrary power any where
that can separately, secretly and
of its single choice disturb the
peace of the world; or if it. can
not presently be destroyed, at
least its reduction
potency.'
"The power which has hit the
heretofore controlled German
nation, is in short here describ
ed. It is within the choice of
the (lei man nation to alter it."

In the autumn of 1877 he came
to Globe, Arizona, where he es
tablished a brickyard. He re
moved to Calabasas on January

ing and put in a pumping plant
Calabasas was on Baca Float
No. 3, and after the decision
against the settlers he disposed
ol his cattle of which he had
3,500 head, and other interests,

His first wife was Miss Julia
Jordan, whom he married in
1882 and who passed away in
1907. They adopted two sons,
Samuel and Joseph D. In 1908

ing and public spirited citizen.
His residence in the district cov
ered a period of 39 years during
which time he has witnessed
marvelous changes and had con
tributed his part lo the transior-mation.

DEMOCRATIC PLATFORM .
(Continued from first page)
of the administration of Presi
dent Wilson, and their patriotic
and faithful service in all legis
lation relating to the war and
its vigorous prosecution.
To the fighting forces of the
armies of the republic battling
or preparing to battle for the
freedom of the world, we send
greetings of pride and affection,
with the assurance that while
they are facing the foe in front
we will take care of snipers in
the rear; that we will support
the government in every effort
to protect the market basket of
their wives and mothers from
the profiteers, and that we will
not only support and sustain
them now, but remember them
with a nation's gratitude and
care when they come home
again..
We congratulate them on the
wisdom and the foresight of the
national administration in pro
viding a war insurance which
goes farther toward the proper
protection of the lighting forces
than this nation or any other
nation has ever gone befoie.
A sound policy of stateunan
ship will endeavor to create in
America a nation of independent
home owning people. The fed
eral farm loan law is a wise act
of domestic constructive legisla
tion which is making it possible
for industrious persons of small
means to acquire ownership of
farm homes. We favor the am
endment of this law in such
manner as to include within its
beneficent provisions farm lands
under government irrigation pro
jects, and the extensiou of the
legislation to include the giant
ingof preferential loans through
the rural credit system under
favorable terms aud conditions
to honorably discharged soldiers
and sailors.
The great task of winning the
war has brought women more
prominently to the front. In
state and national airairs, in
every undertaking for the wel
fare of the men in our fighting
forces, she has played a most
important part. In many indus
tries she has taken her place
side by side with men and is per
forming the same laborious tasks
Six years ago, the Democratic
State of Arizona gave to the
women of the State the right of
suffrage on equal terms with
men, and the wisdom of that ac
tion ' has been justified by the
part that the women of our State
have taken in meeting the public
problems that confronted them.
The worthy women of our State
and nation have given their sons
in the service of our country to
advance the lines of the world's
democracy with all the heroism
that marked the patriotic devo
tion of the Spartan mothers in
ancient times. And the sisters
and daughters of our fighting
forces have shown the same de
votion to patriotism and self sa
crifice. We heartily endorse the De
mocratic administration of the
State for its economical adminis
tration of public affairs, and
point with pride to the fact, for
which the Democratic party is
responsible, that every class of
property is now contributing its
proper share to the burdens of
government, thus insuring a fair
rate of taxation, and enabling
the State government to go for
ward without debt or incum
brance. We congratulate the farmers
of the State upon the circum
stance that they are able, as a
result of Democratic legislation,
to obtain State money at a low
rate of interest; and we favor an
amendment to our State land
loan laws that will enable farm
ers under government reclama
tion projects to participate in
the benefits thereof.
We endorse the party's policy
of building up and maintaining
a system of permanent state
roads, and pledge our legislative
nominees to a continuation of
that policy.
We call attention to the achie
vements of the party in estab
lishing and maintaining one of
the best public school systems
in the United States, and favor
the broadening and extension of
that branch of the system which
provides for vocational educa
tion.
The State Primary law, though
correct in theory, as it is at pre
sent constituted and operates is
a grave menace to the existing
and accepted theory of American
government, and fatal to the
securing to an unquestionable
determination of the choice of
political parties of candidates
for office. We believe that the
primary law should be so am
ended as to insure the registra
tion of electors as members of
the political party to which they
belong.
In these times of extraordin
ary stress, when whole hearted
loyalty to the government and
obedience to constituted author
ity is so essential to the cause in
which our nation's life blood is
being poured out, all forms of
lawlessness and of acts obstruc
tive to the government's efforts,
by whomsoever committed, must
be handled with an iron hand.
Wo condemn in unmeasured
terms the pernicious doctrines of
sabotage and direct action, as
advocated aud practiced by the
so called Industrial Workers of
the World, and pledge our can
didates, if elected, to effectively
do away with such practices in
Arizona, and to all methods of
usurpation Of the functions of
regularly constituted officials,
executive and judicial, to whom
the settlement of irreconcilable
grievances belong. We point to
the fact that it was during the
administration of the Republican
de facto Governor of the State
that such violations of the law
and of the Constitution became
most frequent, without his voice
being raised or the power of the
office he was occupying being
invoked to prevent them.
The Democratic party of Ari
zona presents as its caudidate
for Governor, the Hon. Fred. T.
Colter, a native son of the state,
a man of splendid business capa
city, well equipped by legisla
tive experience, and thoroughly
qualified for the performance of
the responsible duties of the ex
alted office for which he has
been named. And we denounce
in unmeasured terms the hypo
critical efforts of the opposition
to cast a cloud upon the eligibil
ity of our candidate for Govern
or, and we call upon all loyal
democrats and fair-minded citi
zens to condemn by their votes
this malicious attempt to dis
credit Democracy's chosen can
didate. Upon this statement of prin
ciples we enter the campaign
confident of the party's united
support of the Democratic ticket,
National, State and County, and
we invite the cooperation and
assistance of all good citizens.
