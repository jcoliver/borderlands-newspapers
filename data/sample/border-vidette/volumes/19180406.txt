for the nomination of Secretary
of State, on the Democratic

All of the mountains through
out the Mohave ranges are cov
ered with snow. The snowfall
on the Wallapais was the heavi
est of the year Wednesday last,
14 inches falling on the Copper-

of the big trucks of the Levia-
tan Mine company, bucked this
snow with a load of 5500 pounds
of molybdenum concentrates and
arrived in Yucca without mishap
during the heavy part of the
storm.

infringe on the rights of others,
his going and coming does not
excite comment.
On Tuesday the telegraph car

had been chosen as receiver of
the United States land office at
Phoenix. The news will be
pleasing to the thousands of
friends who know Mr. White as

for a number of years sheriff of
Cochise county where he made
an excellent record. Eater he
was with Col. W. C. Greene at
Cauanea mines in Sonora, Mex

A. V. Waggoner, formerly a
professor in the University of
Oregon, was in Kingman this
week looking over the field with
a view to putting in a decorting
plant to obtain the fiber from
the common Spanish bayonet or
yucca. Should he and associates
decide to nut the plant in here
it will necessitate the erection
of buildings and the employ
ment of a large number of men
and women. Adjuncts to the
plant would cost in the neigh
borhood of $100,000, and would
be of great value to Kingman.

Ideal spring weather now pre
vails and farmers are nearly
ready to begin cutting the first
crop of alfalfa. Within two
weeks haying will be in full
blast throughout the valley.
The cotton crop is nearly all
planted. The water supply in
the Roosevelt reservoir is in
creasing and lacks but 17 feet of
being as deep as one year ago.
When full to the spillways the
reservoir holds 225 feet in depth
of water. It is now above the
200 mark. This assures ample
water for the season and with
reasonable rainfall the big lake
may j'et till to the brim. Mes

cultivation last year through the
activities of a mining company,
was in Pima county through the
agency of the New Cornelia
Copper company. Providing
seed and stimulus, is secured the
cultivation of hundreds of ad
ditional acres by the Papago
Indians on their reservation,
where, the wheat crop having
failed, they were induced to put
in beans and later were so pro
tected in the market that they
received for the first time in
their farming history, a full
market price for their product.
This year the Indians are again
being encouraged to grow beans
and will have a much larger
acreage than in 1918.

BOB WHITES FOR ARIZONA.
G. M. Willard, game warden
of Arizona, has perfected a plan
for the propagation of the bob
white in the state. He has just
arranged with the game warden
of Oklahoma for the exchange
of a number of the gamble quail,
common here, for a number of
bob white quail, which are plent
iful in Oklahoma and other mid
dle western states. The ex
change is made on the basis of
one bob white for two gamble
quail, and Mr. Williard has ar
ranged for the trapping of fifteen
dozen of the latter. The birds
will be delivered to Mr. Willard
at a cost of 4 per dozen by the
trappers, while these birds are
quoted at $22.
The bob whites are to come
from Oklahama City and will be
liberated near Yuma, Tucson,
Buckeye, the Tonto Basin and
south of Phoenix. They will
not reach Arizona before fall.

The following from a letter
written by Sergeant J. Russell
Halstead, of the J. D. Halstead
Ijumber Company of Nogale-i,
and other places in Arizona, to
his father, J. D. Halstead of
Phoenix, will be interesting to a
host of Joe's friends, here and
throughout the state:
"It has been two months at
least since you received my last
letter.
"Things have been going along
so fast the past two months that
there has been no way to write,
so you are receiving this letter
just as soon as it was possible
to get it to you. You are in a
much better shape than I, as I
have not heard from anyone
since leaving the states. When
you are over here, you get no
news at all except the mail from
over there. So I wish you would
all "whip up," and write more
often and be sure and tell me
the news. You know there is
but little that I can tell you on
account of the Censorship, but
the letters from the States com
ing into here, are not censored,
so you can tell me all the
news.
"Could write you a very in
teresting letter if I was permit
ted to do so, but anyway I am
storing it all up, and will have
plenty to tell you when I return.
"We had a very nice trip
across. Only had a few rough
days, and as I never get sea
sick, it did'nt bother me at all.
I had a very nice stateroom and
the eats were very good, so
things were fine.
"We stopped in the city where
we landed for five days. The
troops were quarterd in an old
barracks built about one hun
dred and fifty years ago. Had a
high stone wall all around them,
so that the fellows were just
like being in prison. I was out
every day looking after our bar
racks bags and other supplies
that we shipped over with us,
so had a nice time, as I would
get at least three hours to my
self each day. The only trouble
was that I had no one with me
and couldn't talk to anyone as
they spoke nothing but French,
but I took a good look and let it
go at that.
"After leaving there, we got
the hard part of the trip. Came
across country on the train in
third class compartment cars
packed with eight men in each
compartment which was about
five by seven. We were four
days and nights like that and it
wasn't very warm without any
fire. You might think that we
went a long distance by the
length of time that it took, but
just remember that the train
service over here is not what it
is in the States.
"We landed in a small vallage
and opened up our office. I be
gan running around then and
since that time have driven over
two thousand miles. So you see
I have been on the go some.
Our office moved from the town
into our present location one
week ago and we are fixed up
fine. Have a store building rent
ed about the center of town
where we have our office and
are eating at the best mess I
have eaten at since coming into
the Army.
"We are in a town of about
one hundred thousand, so there
is something to see when we
have the time to look around.
I haven't had much time so far
as I am working about as long
hours as I did while in the
States. I hope it keeps up this
way, as the time passes faster
when there is plenty to do. I
have taken a number of good
pictures but cannot send any of
them to the States. Will have
to wait and bring them back
with me.
"This is sure a pretty country
and the finest roads that you
could imagine. Just like Cali
fornia everywhere. You run into
a small village about every three
or four miles and there seems to
be no speed limit, so you can
run as fast as you care to. I am
starting out tomorrow and will
make about three hundred miles I
before returning here. Y'ou know
how this kind of work suits me,
so you know I am well satisfied.
"I do my laundry work every
few nights, but my suit is some
riiity. I had enough clothes to
last me a year when we left and
had just bought a large barracks
bag to put them in, and of
course had everything in it, but
the clothes I had on my back.
Lo.-.t everything on the way
over.
"I am looking for mail every
day trom some of you. Be sure
and tell me all the news about
the business, as we hear nothing
over lie re."

THE PATAGONIA DISTRICT.
The Flux manager, Mr. F. B.
Kollbarg, is uegociating for the
purchnse of the old tramway,
which has been at the Flux mine
for many years.
The Castle Butte, which has
been taking a temporary rest, is
to start work immediately. The
mine recently shipped a carload
of good copper ore.
An air compressor and other
new machinery has been install
ed at the Arizona - European
mine, and the property is be
ginning to look like the "real
thing" in mines.
Joe Miller, one of the leases
of the Castle Butte mine, who
has been on the sick list for a
few days, is again around town.
He will be at the mine when it
resumes operations.
The showings in the Arizona
European mine are still good,
and ore will soon be shipped in
larger quantities from this prop
erty than has been sent to the
smelter in the past.
The Dixie, which is being su
perintended by Tom Stafford, is
about to cut the ore body be
neath the old shaft. This mine
has high grade lead ore at the
bottom of the old shaft, and it
is expected that the work of
getting out the ore will be much
cheapened by taking it out by
way of the tunnel, which is in
now about .'100 feet.
Reyes Morales met with a
serious accident last Saturday
on the new Washington Nogales
road, when his Ford turned tur
tle as a result of a broken steer
ing rod. His nose was almost
completely torn from his face
and his kneecap was badly lacer
ated. It is a miracle that he
was not killed outright, as the
machine took a plunge of about
eighteen feet over the embank
ment and turned upside-down,
smashing the top beyond repair.
Mr. Andrew Miles, a Texas
sheepman, looking lor a new
range after having traveled 2500
miles through New Mexico and
Arizona, says he has found what
he has been looking for in the
Sonoita valley along the eastern
slope of the Santa Rita moun
tains. He says this is the most
favorable sheep range in the
southwest. Mr. Miles is plan
ning to ship in about 200 head
of sheep and a well-drilling out
fit to insure a water supply for
his herd, provided he can pur
chase a piece of ground that he
has in view a few miles north of
Sonoita. When asked how the
cowmen would take to his plans,
he replied: "They get sore for
a little while, but soon get over
their grouch." Santa Cruz Pat-agonian.

UNCLE SAM'S COMMANDMENTS
President Wilson is about to
sign a bill which takes its place
in history at the most liberal le
gislation protection of a uation's
fighters ever known. It is good
enough, strong enough to be
called the National Ten Com
mandments, and is, in effect,
thus:
Thou shalt not evict, for non
payment of rent, a soldier's de
pendents, under penalty of $10,
000 tine.
Thou shalt not cut off a sol
dier's life insurance because of
delayed premiums.
Thou shalt not foreclose a
mortgage on a soldier's property.
Thou shalt not take away a
soldier's home on which he has
made part payment.
Thou shalt not sell a soldier's
property because of his failure
to pay the taxes, national, state
or local.
Thou shalt not settle a law
suit against a soldier during his
absence.
If a soldier sue, the courts
shall postpone action until he
can attend to it.
If a soldier have a mine, or
timber or farm claim, assess
ments on which are overdue, it
shall be held for him.
Honor thy soldier and thy
sailor, that thy days may be
long in the land of liberty.
No man hath greater love than
he that offereth bis life for the
world's sake, and it is-command-ed
that neither lawyers, nor the
loan sharks, nor the gatherers
of tithes shall fatten on him.
Congress is content to call this
bill a civil rights bill. It's the
divine rights bill. Washington

The Spirit of Friendship.
This store looks upon its patrons not
merely as customers but as friends.
People purchase here because they
have friendly feeling for this store.
The cause which develops this friendly
feeling, may differ, in fact, they are
sure to differ. One's friendship for
the store is the result of finding good
values; another's is the result of effi
cient service and courteous treatment,
and so on.
Naturally this f riendshiply feeling on
the part of our patrons is reciprocated
on our part. And this spirit of mutual
friendship is an impetus for greater
service and an incentive to ever-increasing
endeavor to make this store
a place where every visitor will feel
perfectly at home.

Life
Was a
Misery
Mrs. F. M. Jones, of
Palmer, Okla., writes:
"From the time I en
tered into womanhood
... I looked with dread
from one month to the
next. I suffered with my
back and bearing-down
pain, until life to me was
a misery. I would think
1 could not endure the
pain any longer, and I
gradually got worse. . .
Nothing seemed to help
me until, one day, . . .
J decided to
TAKE
The Woman's Tonic
"I took four bottles,"
Mrs. Jones goes on to
say, "and was not only
greatly relieved, but can
truthfully say that I have
not a pain. . .
" It has now been two
years since I tookCardui,
and I am still i:i good
health. . . I would ad
vise any woman or girl
to use Cardui who is a
sufferer from any female
trouble."
If you suffer pain caused
from womanly trouble, or
if you feel the need of a
good strengthening tonic
to build up yourrun-down
system, take the advice
of Mrs. Jones. Try Car
dui. It helped her. We
believe it wHl help you.
