PROMISING PROPERTY.
A property that promises soon
to develop into a producer of
silver is the Abe Lincoln, for
merly known as the Blue Nose,
which was recently taken under
bond and lease from the owner,
Colonel R. R. Richardson, by
James Layman, a prominent
miningv man of Jerome. Mr.
Layman lost no time in starting
operations on this old time pro
ducer, the first work being the
construction of a road to the
mine, located two miles from
Harshaw. This will permit of the
installation of the heavy machin
ery which has already arrived
in Patagonia. It consists of a
25 horse-power Fairbanks Morse
engine and a Sullivan air com
pressor. The main shaft on this
property is now down 150 feet,
and the terms of the lease call
for the immediate sinking of this
shaft to a depth of 250 feet.
The work being done at the
Abe .Lincoln is in charge of
Michael Hogan, an experienced
mining man.
Those who are acquainted with
the history of this well known
mine are confident it will "re
peat" and again become a pro
ducer of the white metal on an
even larger scale than in the
past. Patagonian.

MAMMOTH LETTUCE.
j
Did any one ever hear of Cal
ifornia or any other state ex
cepting Arizona producing let
tuce that weighs nearly three
pounds to each head. Well,
that's now grown in the San
Rafael Valley, a few miles from
Patagonia, and this week the
Patagonian received from Mrs.
George W. Parker two heads of
lettuce the combined weight of
which was five and three cpuarter
pounds.
The home place of Mr. and
Mrs. George W. Parker on the
headwaters of the Santa Cruz
river is one of the many beauty
spots of the great Southwest
where a welcome is always ex
tended to friend or stranger.
Besides the extensive cattle in
terests of Mr. and Mrs. Parker,
they find considerable time to
devote to agriculture, fruit rais
ing and gardening, and at the
present time there are at their
ranch growing crops, veget
ables, berne-s and flowers in
abundance, making the Parker
home a show olace well worth
visiting Patagonian.
WILL VISIT LOS ALAMOS RANCH
Lieut. Theodore Marburg, late

British army, who has just re
ceived his release from the Eng

Monday en route to Sonora,
where he will visit on the Kib
bey ranch, Los Alamos, near
Magdaena.
The young officer, who is the
son of a former U. S. minister
to Belgium, was in the latter
country preparing to enter Ox
foid,at the time war was declared.
He volunteered for service with
the British forces immediately,
and was sent to an aviation
training camD. After receiving
his commission as a flier, he was
wounded and suffered the loss
of a leg, but returned to the ser
vice and saw the finish of the
war with the British army.
Young Marburg, whose home
is in Baltimore, and who spent
several months in this country a
number of years ago, will pro
bably locate in Sonora. Star.
SILVER MAY SAVE THE DAY.
Mining is at low ebb. High
prices for everything but the
ore have brought the camps to a
standstill with the exception of
the gold at a fixed price. Lead,
zinc and tungsten have to meet
foreign markets, and without a
tariff they can not compete.
The announcement from Wash
ington that the authorities have
removed restrictions on the price
of silver comes as an oasis to a
desert traveler. Silver may save
the day until such time as con
gress is permitted to act and
deal with protection as a press
ing issue for the Wertern states.
If silver as a commodity, dealt
in by the world, goes to its
former bimetallic price, this
would mean the difference be
tween a slight profit on low
grade ores and a dead loss on
these same ores. Rocky Moun

A BIG BUSINESS CHANGE.
Don Ramon Vasc.ue Sells The Red
House to Joe Berk.
Yesterday (Monday) announce
ment was made of :i business
change in the line city that was
a real surprise; and it emplia
sizes the oLd adage that the un
expected is what happens, says
the Oasis.
After twenty nine years of suc
cessful merchandising in Xoga
les, Mr. Ramon Vasquez has
sold to Joseph lierk of the Mo
dern Store, the colossal empo
rium known long and well as
the Red House (La Casa Colo
rada,) and retires from business.
The transaction is the heaviest
in that line ever carried out in
Santa Cruz county; and the
transfer is reported to involve
$125,000.
When Nogales was young Mr.
Vasquez embarked iu business
here in a small way; but strict
attention to business resulted in
steady and substantial growth
until the Red House had become
one of the largest and most
widely known department stores
anywhere on the international
boundary, housed in a great
building of three stories and a
basement, housing one of the
largestand most complete stocks
of dry goods, ladies' dress goods,
men's and boys' clothing, boots
and shoes, etc., anywhere in the
Southwest. Mr. Vaquez now re
tires to take a well earned ease,
and enjoy a competence.
During the past seven years
there has been associated with
Mr. Vasquez one of the most
wide awake and thoroughly
trained managers in the United
States, who has contributed
greatly to the success and pre
stige of the establishment, Mr.
J. A. Legarra.
One $o active, with so wide a
knowledge of the country, its
people, their wants and needs;
and with a mastery of the mys
teries of trade that is perfect
and masterly, Mr. Legarra will
not remain idle any length of
time. In fact the change was
hardly announced before Mr.
Legarra was the recipient of
several flattering offers. He says
he will rest a little while.
All the old timers and many
others, will regret to see Mr.
Vasquez go out froi active bus
iness pursuits; but they all will
be cheered by th fact that, he
will continue to make his resi
dence in the line city.
The new proprietor, Mr. Joe
Berk, proprietor of the Modern
Store has been in business in
Nogales a number of years; and
he has achieved a high place
among the active, energetic bus
iness men of the city. To a re
porter Mr. Berk confided that
his plans are not matured en
tirely as yet, but Ite intends
making the Red House one of
the largest most .widely known
commercial establishments in
the country.
PASSING OF JAMES RENSHAW.
James Renshaw, father of H.
R. Renshaw of Nogales, and Al
fred S. Renshaw of California,
died this morning at the ripe old
age of 82 years, says Wednes
day's Herald. There is probably
not another man in this section
of the country that lived as in
teresting a life as the deceased.
James Renshaw was born in
Baltimore, Md., May 10, 1837,
and when but a small boy wasi
pupil in the Brook Farm School
in Massachusetts, where he was
taught by Charles A. Dana, the
famous publisher of the New
York Sun.
In 1854, he was sent by a
French colony organization of
New Jersey to find a suitable
location near Dallas, Texas, for
the establishment of a colony.
Mr. Renshaw, who was a talent
ed linguist, stayed at the colony
for two years, translating and
interpreting French.
He then went to New York,
studied and graduated from an
engineering school and was given
a commission in the United
States Navy, being attached to
the frigate "Susquehanna" light
ing aboard that ship all through
the civil war. In 1807, Mi. Ren
shaw resigned from the navy
and went to South America be
ing attached to the Argentine
government.
He returned to the United
States in 171 going into the
mining machinery business in
New York and later establishing
a business in Denver from where
he supplied mines all through
the western country.
For the past few years, Mr.
Renshaw has made his home in
Nogales tfrith his wife and son
Harry. The deceased was a
member of the Free and Accept
ed Order of Masons and the Mil
itary Order of the Loyal Legion
of Honor of the United. States.

My Dear Mr. Curtis:
Your letter of May 28, enclos
ing check for SQ'-i 50 as the bal
ance of your collections from J
Santa Cruz county is received,
and I thank you for it. It is
certainly a pleasure to write to
one county in this state 'where
the collections are over 100 per
cent.
The total amoujjt of your pled
ges according to the records in
this office is $12,292.20 and your
total credit paid is $12,360.79,
making you overpaid $08.50.
This is certainly a wonderful re
cord and I want to congratulate
your county and all of those who
made this record possible, for
their splendid work.
You are the only county in
the state that has made a 100
per cent collection record al
though some others are within
h per cent of it, but nothing
equals the record of Santa Cruz
county in this state.
Yours very truly,
J. O. SlOXSON.

ment was proven yesterday when
he refused to read his manifiesto
to the citizens of Nogales, So

all political factions were united,
cognizant of his views and that
their views were parallel with
his.
It was a unique setting that
was presented, when General
Obregon stepped on the porch
of the Hotel Abadie. located fifty
feet south of the International
border, and spoke to throngs of
Mexican citizens in the streets
below while groups of Amer
icans having no passports crowd
ed close to the wire fence on
the boundary line and listened
to the reading of the manifiesto.
Gen. Obregon touched on a
program that he would follow if
elected President of Mexico,
paying particular attention to
International situation. t
In the manifiesto it is stated
that all rights acquired by for
eigners in the Republic of Mex
ico will be respected and pro
tected. It is also stated that if Obre
gon is elected, that in the future
foreigners will be entitled to any
privileges they held and had
taken away.
Alphose Velez, president of
the Gaxiola party in Sonora,
made a stirring address regard
ing the candidacy of Gen. Obre
gon and was well received by
the Mexican citizens. The mani
fiesto of Gen. Obregon is being

vereignty as an autonomous na
tion. "Absolute respect to the so
vereignty and institutions of all
the Nations of the World.
"K'ull recognition of all for
eigners, legitimately acquired
rights in our country, in com
plete accord with our laws.
"To offer all sorts of facilities
and encouragement to capital

improvement of our natural re
sources, always bearing in mind,
the most practical and equitable
way of effecting a harmonious
conciliation of the advantages to
be derived by Capital, Labor
and the National Revenue.
"To see that all foreigners in
Mexico may, in the most ample
form, enjoy all the guarantees
and protection which our laws
afford them.

Army Officers May Cross Border
At the request of the adminis
tration at Washington, which is
endeavoring to promote better
relations between the United
States and Mexico, Colonel Earl
Carna-han, commanding the No
gales sub district, accompanied
by Collector of Customs Charles
E. Hardy and ex Mayor Wirt G.
Bowman, yesterday visited As
tolfo Cardenas, mayor of Noga
les, Sonora, and asked permis
sion for American army officers
in uniform, to cross the border
in Nogales, Sonora, on sight
seeing tours, says Tuesday's
Herald.
Presidente Cardenas received
the visitors graciously and said
that he would be more than
pleased to grant the request
made by the emissaries of the
United States government. Pre
sidente Cardenas presented the
American visitors to General Al
varo Obregon, who expressed
his gratification at being able to
offer his services to all visiting
American officers, who might
visit Nogales, Sonora, as did
Alberto Diaz, collector of cus
toms at Nogales, Sonora.
"Wn had a most pleasant visit
with Presidente Cardenas, Gen
eral Obregon and Collector Diaz,
said Collector of Customs Hardy,
this morning, and I am sure that
if our officers cross the line and
mingle with the residents of So
nora, the relations between Mex
ico and the United States, -particularly
in this section of the
country will be cemented into a
firm bond of friendship."
The news that officers in un
iform will be allowed to cross
the border will be hailed with
delight by the commissioned men
of the 25th Infantry, most of
whom speak Spanish, having
been stationed in Latin speak
ing countries.
No American soldiers have
been allowed into Mexico since
1912 when a presidential order
was issued making it a court
martial offense for any officer to
cross the Mexican boundary line.
