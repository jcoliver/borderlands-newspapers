Langstreth suggests that per
sods interested in cultivation of
the wily castor bean should visit
the Experiment Station and see
what has been done in this
branch of government supply
work. The climate of Yuma
seems to be ideal for growing
this valuable plant, and the pro
fit therefrom is large. Present
prices net the grower about S3. 10

MINING HELPS ALL CLASSES.
There are millions of people
in this country who have little
knowledge of the vast import
ance of trie mining industry as
affecting other lines of business
and occupation.
For instance, the Utah Copper
Company gives employment to
6,000 men. During its brief ex
istence it has paid nearlv $80,
000, 000 in dividends. But dar
ing this period it has paid $225,
000,000 for supplies, machinery,
labor, equipment, land, etc.
It has an average payroll of
$750,000 per month. This vast
amount is distributed through
various channels until every line
of industry and endeavor is
reached and beneficially affected.
The amount paid by the com
pany for labor in 1917 amounts
to twice .as much as the total
tax collected by Salt Lake coun
ty in the year 1914. Its assess
ment for national, state and
county taxes for 1917 equaled
the total taxes collected in the
state of Utah for the year 1914.
This is a fair illustration of
the record of scores of Western
mining companies which are
straining every effort to main
tain production under abnormal
conditions.
The beneficial results of min
ing are many and far-reaching,
and it is hierh time that the eo
ple of the United States come to
a better understanding of what
the industry means to them, and
to the nation. Yavapai.
Thousand Nurses Per Week Wanted.
An army of a million men
needs 16,000 nurses, according
to General Ireland, U. S. A.,
who has cablegramed the Na
tional Rsd Cress department of
nursing in regard to conditions
brought about by the present
offensive.
There is a shortage of nurses
in France according to this es
timate as we now have more
than a million men there and
less than 8000 nurses less than
half the number required in
times of actual warfare.
One thousand nurses per week
for a period of eight weeks is the
enrollment asked of the Amer
ican Red Cross by the Surgeon
General's office to meet this
shortage and replace those be
ing withdrawn from cantonments
for service iD Europe.
Miss Lillian L. White, direct
or of the Pacific division of the
bureatt of nursing, is conducting
a campaign to meet the quota of
this state. In former drives for
enrollment only registered gra
duates were accepted, but in
this emergency graduates who
have not registered are qualified
and the ruling prohibiting for
eign service by those with broth
ers in the army or navy has also
been cancelled.
Over 2600 nurses were enroll
ed by the Red Cross in July and
the papers of 1150 nurses for
service in military hospitals
were sent to the surgeon gen
eral's office. Approximately 300
nurses for foreign service per
week have been equipped
through the equipment center in
New York, but to meet this new
emergency call it will be neces
sary to double enrollments and
increase assignments to duty.
JUST AMERICAN.
Just today we chanced to meet
Down upon the crowded street;
And I wondered whence he came,
What was once his nation's name.
So I asked him, "Tell me true,
Are you Pole or Russian Jew,
English, Scotch, Italian, Russian,
Belgian, Spanish, Swiss,
Moravian,
Dutch, Greek or Scandinavian."
Then he raised his head ou high,
As he gave me this reply:
"What I was is naughty to me,
In this land of Liberty.
In my soul as man to man,
I am just American."

ARIZONANS MAKE GOOD.
Splendid Record of One Young Man
At Camp Kearney.
"Arizona can justifiably feel
proud of the 158th," said Lieut
enant Jess LeBaron of Camp
Kearney, in a recent visit to
Prescott, on furlough.
"Compared with regiments
from other States now gathered
at Camp Kearney, the Arizonans
stand head and shoulders above
them all," he said. "This ap
plies not only to the men physi
cally, but to their work. The
boys are full of pep and enthus
iastic over army life, and there
is not a one of them but who is
impatiently awaiting his chance
to get to France and mix it with
the Huns. '
"A short time ago the captain
of the company of which I was
a member told the 176 men that
27 of them would be selected for
immediate service overseas. He
asked those who desired'to vol
unteer for the service to take
two steps forward. Just 173
signified their desire to be among
the number selected.
"The other three were Mex
icans who did not understand
the statement. When it was ex
plained to them, they too, were
eager to be sent.
"When the Arizona boys get
in action 'over there' there will
not be a mother or father of any
of them but who will be proud
of the account they give of them
selves." SOUTHERN ARIZONA FAIR
The 1918 Southern Arizona
fair, to be held immediately be
fore or after the state fair, will
be "a la militaire," Sec. Herbert
Drachman announces. Just what
military units will attend the
fair is not known, owing to the
fact that all military forces at
present are more or less mobile,
but it is expected there will be
some cavalry and a band from
either Fort Huachuca or Nogales
Another feature this year will
be calf-tying, for which the prizes
will total $2,000. There will be
a calf tying contest each day of
the three day program and ex
perts in that sportive vocation
are expected to be here from all
parts of the southwest.
The automobile racing events
will be limited to local partici
pants. This part of the program
will be in charge of Dick Hard
ing, Jr., and Monte Mansfield.
The agricultural and horticul
tural exhibits will be in charge
of Ben Johnson of the Tucson
Farms company.
The directors of the Southern

railroad is now nearing its finish,
there being but a few miles re
maining to complete the road
into Yuma. The last part of
the road was quite difficult of
construction, there being at least
eighteen short tunnels and many
fills to complete to close up the
incomplete work. The road will
be a short line from the south
part of the state to the coast,
passing out through the desert
and across the mountains to the
ocean. The road was at one
time intended to connect with
the Burlington but the failure oT
that road to build into Yuma put
a damper on the project. It is
now possible that it will be a
nart ot the Southern Pacific.

SECOND BATTLE OF NOG ALES .
Many Mexicans and Americans Killed
and Wounded.
Like a thunder bolt from a
clear sky, cauqe the second bat
tle of Nogales, last Tuesday af
ternoon, during which probably
dozens of lives were lost and
scores of Americans and Mex
icans, many non-combatants,
were wounded.
The first battle of Nogales was
fought between American sol
diers commanded by Colonel
Sage, and Villa Mexican soldiers,
who were driven out of Nogales,
Sonora, by soldiers commanded
by Generals Calles and Obregon.
The second battle, which many
believe, had been brewing since
the first battle, was between
Mexican customs guards, Mex
ican solders, Mexican citizens
of Nogales, Sonora, and Amer
ican soldiers and citizens of No
gales, Arizona.
The first battle was started
when a Villa soldier fired across
the international line; the sec
ond battle started when a Mex
ican customs guard shot an Am
erican border sentinel, who was
performing his duty. v
Fighting began about four
o'clock Tuesday afternoon, when
a Mexican suspected of being a
smuggler, attempted to cross
into Mexico, near the U. S. cus
toms house. A. A. Barber, a
United States customs inspect
or, and an American border sen
tinel, commanded the man to
halt, at Liit same time pointing
their guns at him. They did
not shoot, but- a Mexican guard
appeared and deliberately open
ed fire on the sentinel, shooting
him through the lungs. He
died later at the base hospital.
Inspector Barber then opened
lire on the Mexican guard who
shot the sentry, and killed him.
The firing then became gen
eral, Mexicans shooting from
doors, windows, roofs of houses
and behind buildings. Their fire
was returned by American sol
diers on patrol duty, and an
apeal lor aid was sent to Camp
Stephen Little A call for the
Nogales Home Guard was also
sent out and Sheriff Earhart and
Marshal Lowe soon had their
men stationed on buildings along
the border.
Pour companies of the 3"th
Infantry and two troops of the
! 10th Cavalry, under command of
Liieut. Colonel Herman rushed
to the line, where a few minutes
later the Colonel received a
wound in the knee. After re
ceiving first aid he returned to
the fire line.
Captain J. D. Hungerford at
the head of a troop of the 10th
Cavalry crossed the line east of
town, and was shot and instant
ly killed.
Two of the U. S. troopers who
crossed the line and drove the
snipers from the hills back of
the Central Hotel, were wounded
Corporal Barney Lotz, Com
pany G, 35th Infautry, died of
his wounds.
Gaston Reddoch, the brave
lad who took the rifle of a wound
ed soldier, was fatally shot and
died later at the base hospital.
First Lieutenant L.W. Loftus,
Company G, 35th Infantry, also
fatally wounded by Mexican
snipers, died at the base hos
pital .
Soon after tha battle started
Felix B. Penaloza, mayor of No
gales, Sohora, was shot and in
stantly killed as he was enter
ing his automobile in front of
the drug store in Nogales, So
nora. Jesus Borboa, a well
known pioneer citizen of Sonora,
was also killed as he was cross
ing Elias street in front of his
home.
During the battle which lasted
until nearly sundown, when a
white Hag was hoisted on the
Mexican customs house, many
thousand shots were fired across
the international line, and many
residences were riddled with
bullets. That more people were
not hit is past understanding.
The international boundry was
closed to all traffic throughout
the night, and until about three
thirty o'clock Wednesday after
noon, during which time no one
was permitted to cross.
As a result of a conference
held Wednesday afternoon be
tween General De Rosey Cabell,
representing the Americans, and
General P. Elias Calles, repre
senting President Carranza, it is
believed there will be no further
trouble as a result of the second
battle of Nogales, which is re
gretted by all good citizens of
both countries.
Following the conference of
generals, the following official
statement for publication was
given out by General Cabell:
"I met with General Calles at
3 o'clock, having previously re
ceived a telegram from him ex
pressing regret at the unfortun
ate incident of yesterday after
noon.
"Upon meeting with General
Calles I expressed equal regret
that this incident should have
occurred.
"General Calles stated that he
had been directed by President
Carranza to come to Nogales im
mediately to take steps to stop I
the trouble here on his side of
the border. He expressed him
self as being satisfied that there
would be no further trouble as a
result of yesterday's unfortunate
occurrence."

FOURTH LIBERTY LOAN.
The campaign for the Fourth
Liberty Loan will begin Septem
ber 28th and close October 19th.
The result of the loan will be
watched with keen interest in
Europe, not only by our asso
ciates in the war against Teuto
nic powers, but by our enemies.
It will be regarded by them as a
measure of the American peo
pie's support of the war.
The Germans know full well
the tremendous weight and sig
niticance of popular support of
the war, of the people at home
backing up the army in the tield.
As the loan succeeds our en
emies will sorrow; as it falls
short they will rejoice. Every
dollar subscribed will help and
encourage the American soldiers
and hurt and depress the en
emies of America.
The loan will be a test of the
loyalty and willingness of the
people of the United States to
make sacrifices compared with
the willingness of our soldiers to
do their part. There must be
and will be no failure by the peo
ple to measure up to the courage
and devotion of our men in Eu
rope. Many of them have given
up their lives; shall we at home
withhold our money V Shall we
spare our dollars vhile they
spare not their very lives?

tle, or before taking quite
all, 1 felt much better. I
