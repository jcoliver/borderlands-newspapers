Abo'it thirty thousand acres
of the teparv bean will be plant
ed this yer in the Uuited-States.
of which 10,000 will be planted
in Arizona. The crop should be
around P.0.000,000 pounds. The
latest quotation is 28 cents in
Los Angeles.
R. .1. Selkirk of the locnl fore
stry office has been transferred
to the Coconino National Forest
Reserve and will take up his
new duties within the near fut
ure. The charier was made at
his request as he was seeking a
higher altitude lor Mrs. Selkirk's
health. They will move to
Flagstaff shortly.
A complete crop census map
of the state of Arizona is being
made by the Arizona Council of
Defense, under a plan devised
by Chairman Dwight P.. Heard,
which will show the entire crop
acreage of the state now in cul
tivation, and also an outline
map, showing what crops are
contemplated for the year 1018.
The miners of the llisbee dis
trict are ont on strike, with sev
eral thousand men affected. The
strike was not a popular demand
of the home miners but was en
gineered by parties from out
side. Sheriff Harry Wheeler is
on the job to preserve order and
protect miners who wish to
work. The Governor has re
quested a orobe by the Eederal
government.
The El Cajon mines, situated
about forty miles down the river,
have joined the ranks of the
shippers, a carload of ore hav
ing been started from here Wed
nesday for the smelter at Deal
ing, New Mexico for treatment.
This is initial shipment from this
property, consisting of about
thirty-five tous and the result is
awaited with interest by the
owners. Benson Signal.
The Southern Pacific played
an extraordinary part in assist
ing the Pacific coast to over
subscribe the Liberty Loan. Fig
ures made public at the general
offices of the company in San
Francisco, show that the total
amount subscribed by employes
on the Pacific System alone,
reached $1 ,i51P,000. Th's sum was
pledged in twelve days after the
call issued by President Sproule.
A change in the banking situa
tion, for which plans are all com
plete, is to be made in a very
short time, whereby the banking
facilities of Benson will be in
creased by the addition of more
capital and a broader field of
operations. The Bank of Benson
will disappear and in its place
and stead will rise the Cochise
County State Bank, with a cap
ital stock of $30,000.00 and sur
plus and profits of $4,750,00.
A five-million dollar company,
incorporated under the laws of
Delaware for the construction of
a plant similar to that at Ajo
and the operation of twenty-nine
claims of carbonate ores in the
Twin Buttes district, has been
announced in Tucson. Walter
Harvey Weed, the leading me
tallurgist and copper mining en
gineer of the United States,
heads the new corporation. He
will have the executive and ad
ministration power of the com
pany in his own hands.
Nearly 10.0CO acres of govern
ment land that was withdrawn
fiom entry by the reclamation
law has been restored and will
be open for homestead entry at
9:00 o'clock on the morning of
August "JO of the present year
and will become subject to set
tlement and all proper forms of
entry one week after date. All
contestants who have prefer
ence right to enter will be given
30 days in which to exercise
their rights, according to the
announcement yesterday of John
L. Irvin, registrar at the local
land oflic e. Phoenix On;'Ptte.
Lamar Ooub, lortner state en
gineer. who some time ago tvn-
i dered his services as an engineer
to thi war department, has re
ceived a letter from Representa
tive Cnrl Hayden informing him
that General William Black,
chief engineer of the army has
informed him that his tender
will not be accepted on account
of his being over the age limit.
In accordance with suggestions
made by Governor Campbell,
Provost Marshal Crowder in
formed the Arizona executive
that it is desirable as far as pos
sible for the same boards that
had charge of the registration in
the different counties, to act as
boards of review in the receiv
ing of applications for exemp
tion and in the other prelimin
aries of the actual draft.
Government Divides State In Two
Districts.
The government has divided
Arizona, into two districts for the
purpose of the selective draft.
In each district there will be an
appeal board which will decide
all controversies arising under
the operation of the law.
District No. 1 is composed of
the counties of Apache, Navajo,
Coconino, Mohave, Yavapai,
Pinal and Maricopa, fn these
counties on June 5th there 16,
690 registered. Pboenix will be
the headquarters of this district.
District No. 2 is composed of
the counties of Pima, Santa
Cruz, Cochise, Graham, Greenlee,
Gila. Tde number registered on
June 5th were 20,240. Tucson
will be the headquarters of this
district.
The appeal boards, it is un
derstood, are to be composed of
five members, a lawyer, a Doc -toe,
a representative of labor and
a manufacturer.
State Makes Loans to Farmers.
A loan which has just been
made by Nicholas Farrell of the
San Rafael valley from the State
Land Department at Phoenix,
should be of considerable in
terest to farmers in this county.
The State of Arizona, through
the State Land Department,
loans money on improved, pa
tented lands, free from incum
brance of any kind, at a rate of
0 per cent interest, for a period
from 15 to SO years, the loan to
be redeemed at any time after
three months, at the option of
the borrower. An appraiser is
sent from the land department's
office at Phoenix, although it is
now said Mr. McCorkle of No
gales has been appointed by the
department to act as resident
appraiser for this county, who
will appraise the lands, both
farming and grazing, and the
loan is made up to 50 per cent
of the appraised valuation. A
very substantial loan was secur
ed by Mr. Farrell on his home
stead, which is regarded as a
very fine place, having lots of
tillable land. Other homestead
ers who are in need of financial
assistance to carry out more
extensive farming operations
should take up the matter with
this department of the State
govern ment. Patagonian.
ANOTHER MARRIAGE OF Mc!N-TYRES-PARKERS
Miss Ruth Parker and Mr.
John R. Mclntyre, of Parker
Canyon, were married Tuesday,
June 26, at Tombstone, at the
home of Mr. and Mrs. R. B.
Mclntyre, brother of the groom
and sister of the bride. By this
marriage the last of the children
of these two old and respected
families are united. Another
concidence is that the four Mc
lntyre boys all secured their
wives from the hospitable Park
er home, two marrying daught
ers and the other two marrying
girls who were visiting at the
home. The newly married cou
ple will return to this county
within a few days and make their
future home at Parker Canyou,
where the groom is engaged in
business. A large circle of
frijflnits sincerely wish the young
couple much happiness and prop
erty. Patngoni3n .
THE FIRST ARIZONA
Must Be Recruiting to War Strength
by Aug. 4th. or Lose Its Identity.
I'nless the First Arizona is re
cruited to war strength by Au
gust 4th, the regiment will lose
its identity as an Arizona unit
in the national army and its of
ficers and men will be scattered
to the four winds among the re
giments filled by the selective
draft.
The efforts to recruit men for
the First Arizona have been cer
tainly discouraging. The regi
ment is still short 1,200 men and
the prospects of getting them by
August up to this time seemed
very slim, but a big drive has
been started by the Arizona
Council of Defense for recruits
and it is now pretty certain that
Arizona will have representation
by a unit bearing the State's
name in the new army.
The failure of the young men
of the state to respond has been
due in a great measure to the
belief that the regiment will be
left here for policy duty on the
border and will not see service
in France. This is not the case,
however. The National Guard
regiments are to be concentrat
ed in ten great cantonments and
intensively trained for service
with the first contingent of a
half million men to be sent to
France.
These men, who have exten
sive military training, will na
turally be first on the firing line
and will get there long before
the men chosen by the selective
draft. There will be more op
portunity for promotion and a
better chance to win distinction
in a state regiment like the First
Arizona, than in regiments filled
later by the selective draft.
It would be a lasting disgrace
to the State to have it said all
over the land that Arizona could
not raise a single regiment to
represent the State in France.
BRIGHT FUTURE FOR MINING
Before the conflict on the Con
tinent shall fairly cease, the ac
cumulated product of the mines
of the world for ages will be
scattered over the battlefields of
Europe in the shape of junk a
wicked waste of billions of tons
of base metal, says a writer in a
Los Angeles mining publication.
Millions of tons of steel rails,
girdling the universe, will have
been worn out. Thousands of
cities and towns will lie pros
trate heaps of ruins of brick
and mortar, of structural iron
and twisted wire.
The work of reconstruction
will begin before the terms
of peace are signed. Contracts
for new ships, for the rehabili
tation of railroads, buildings and
bridges, calling for great quan
tities of base metal, will have
been signed. Stocks of such
material in sight are almost ne
gligible. The gold and silver to
pay for them are yet to be ex
tracted from the earth. Stimul
ated by this unprecedented de
mand, the mining industry will
be found to be upon the eve of
a revival never before witnessed,
never so much as dreamed of.
There is nothing new in all
this the sole object in holding
up the picture to your view at
this time is to make you realize
anew the fact that mining is
soon to become the most allur
ing field of industry on the
American continent, that pros
pecting is worth while, and that
developing gives better promise
of assured and quick returns
than any other field of human
industry.
Tucson, Phoenix & Tidewater
railroad extension of the El Paso
& Southwestern railroad is to be
built immediately. Surveyers
have been at work on a new
route for the line which paral
lels the Southern Pasific, almost
to Casa Grande. The survey
that is new being completed into
Phoenix is what is known as the
final survey. As to the exact
ownership of the railroad there
has been some speculation, but
it is certain, say those interest
ed, that it is one or the other or
all three of the Rock Island, El
Paso & Southwestern and the
Tucson. Phnni & Tidewater.

Cardui, the woman's
tonic, helped Mrs. Wil
liam Eversole, of Hazel
Patch, Ky. Read what
she writes: "I had a
general breaking-down
of my health. 1 was in
bed for weeks, unable to
get up. I had such a
weakness and dizziness,
. . . and the pains were
very severe. A friend
toid me I had tried every
thing else, vfhy not
Cardui ? . . . I did, and
soon saw it was helping
me . . . After 12 bottles,
1 am strong and well."
TAKE
The Woman's Tonic
Do you feel weak, diz
zy, worn-out? Is your
lack of good health caused
from any of the com
plaints so common to
women? Then why not
give Cardui a trial? It
should surely do for you
what it has done for so
many thousands of other
women who suffered it
should help you back to
health. i
Ask some lady friend
who has taken Cardui.
She will tell you how it
helped her. Try Cardui.

Because, In straight-distilled gasoline the
boiling points gradually rise in a continuous
unbroken chain, giving easy starting, quick
and smooth acceleration, power and mileage.
Boiling points alone reveal gasoline quality.
Aa the U. S. Bureau of Standards states,
gravity tells you nothing. No mixture, how
ever cleverly concocted and no matter what
its gravity, can cor.tain the correct, unbroken
series of boiling points.
Hed Crown is guaranteed to be a straight
distilled refinery gasoline, the boiling points
of which form a continuous chain. RcdCrown
9 not a mixture.
