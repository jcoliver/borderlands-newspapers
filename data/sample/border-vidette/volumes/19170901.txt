districts in Arizona forage is
plentiful and stock are general
ly in good condition.
The death sentence, imposed
upon William Faltin, January
25, 1913, will be computed, it
was positively stated by Gov.
Thomas E. Campbell yesterday.
James S. Douglas, president
of United Verde Extension min
ing company, it was learned
here today, will leave for Prance
shortly to serve the American
Red Cross in an executive capa
city. Cotton picking has begun on
a small scale and one man on
the south side has 500 pounds
picked already. By the middle
of September picking will be
general throughout Salt River
valley.
Cochise and Graham county
cattle growers will meet at
Gouglas September 3 in semi
annual session and already that
prosperous border city is pre
paring to entertain the mem
bers in royal fashion.
John S. Merrill of Cochiso
county, a member of the second
state legislature has been ap
pointed as superintendent of the
Pioneer Home at Prescott to
succeed J. T. Mahoney of Win
slow who resigned because of ill
health.
Isaac Barth, the bean king of
New Mexico and state senator
from Albuquerque, who has 700
acres of beans planted this sea
son, has been spending some
time recently among the scenes
of boyhood days in Navajo and
Apache counties.
The cases of more than six
teen slackeis were heard and
disposed of in federal court at
Prescott since the court opened
in that city above a week ago.
The offenders were given sen
tences ranging in length from
one day to nine months.
Churn drilling at the Ruby
Copper Company's ground, near
the endline of Pinal, has been
temporarily interrupted, owing
to inability to secure competent
drillers. Engineer C. A. Pierce
reports that he now has exper
ienced drillers on the way from
California, and upon their ar
rival work will again be re
sumed.
The Arizona Consolidated Min
ing Co., which has all the An
derson properties at Greaterville
under bond, is doing extensive
development work, the result of
which promises to rejuvenate
this entire mining district. A
new hoist has just been install
ed and almost daily shipments
of mine materials and supplies
are arriving.
Dr. J. A. Stevens, veterinar
ian, returned from Bisbee Tues
day where he had been conduct
ing tubercular tests on cattle for
the last three weeks. He ex
amined more than 400 milch
cows in the Warren district,
and found the owners anxious to
co operate in the work. Of the
last 240 submitted to tests, eleven
were found to be affected, which,
Doctor Stevens says, is about
the average.
The Duquesne ore haul has
again started coming over the
road to Patagonia, after being
sent to the little Mexican station
on the other side of the line, be
low the Duquesne camp, for a
few weeks. The roads from
this place to Duquesne are now
just barely passable, owing to
the lecent heavy rains, which
for a few days completely tied
up traffic on this important thor
oughfare. The company will
ship probably between 3,000 and
4,000 tons per month from Pata
gonia, and will have the effect
of stimulating several different
kinds of business here. A short
age of cars on the Mexican rail
road is given as the cause for
the change. Patagonian.
The Tucson district board,
acting under its recent ruling
that married men should not be
exempted unless it was clearly
shown that the families were
wholly dependent upon them,
reversed forty-six cases from
Cochise county to which ex
emption had been granted. The
board also reversed the ruling
of the Cochise board in three
cases in which exemptions had
been refused.
A feature of the work of the
State Bureau of Mines, is its
publicity department, which is
in two distinct branches, its ser
vice within the state and that
outside of the state. The Bu
reau is not hampered by red
tape, and when important min-
ling information comes in that
Wiay be of particular value to
the people of the state, it is im
mediately supplied to the news
papers for publication. It is
particularly gratifying to note
that the papers use it promptly.
Fresh water fish may soon be
come more popular than meat in
Cochise county, according to M.
P. Cosby, district state game
warden, whose field work covers
Cochise, Pima and Santa Cruz
counties. Mr. Cosby, who was
in the city yesterday from his
home in Benson, declared that
Joe. V. Prochaska, state game
warden, is gathering data on all
ponds, streams and reservoirs
in this part of the state prepar
atory to stocking them with fish.
Mr. Cosby recently spent sev
eral days in the vicinity of St.
David, and said there are 100
ponds there in which fresh water
fish thrive. Bisbee Review.
Cottonwood, Yavapia county,
today stands as an eloquent ex
ample of what men and means
can do when proper energy is
employed in the right direction.
Where formerly but a postoffice,
one store and several substan
tial brick ranch houses and out
buildings went to make up the
little hamlet of Cottonwood,
there are today between thirty
and thirty-five places of busi
ness, catering to the needs of
several hundred workmen, em
ployed on the construction of
the United Verde Extension im
provements, transient visitors,
prospectors, investors and those
ever-watchful persons from nei
ghboring towns who daily motor
here to note every step of pro
gress made in the new town.
The Patagonia school will open
for the regular term on Monday,
September 3, and the teachers
are beginning to make pre para
tions for the work- The prin
cipal, Mrs. Persis Coombs, who
has been spending the summer
at Washington Camp, will return
to Patagonia next week, and for
the winter will occupy the house
recently vacated by the family'
of C. C. Chapman on Duquesne
avenue, owned by H. H. Mc
Cutchan. This year a special
effort will be made to enforce
the compulsory attendance law,
and all of the children of this
district will therefore be expect
ed to attend school regularly, or
their parents will have to an
swer misdemeanor complaints in
the Justice court. Patagonian.
THOUSANDS OF DUCKS.
Reports from different parts
of the country about Yuma, are
to the effect that literally thous
ands of ducks are already com
ing into this region. J. R. Keer
stated yesterday that while in
the valley during the forenoon,
he saw a flock which would
number no less than one thous
and basking in a newly irrigated
field of alfalfa. In the Bard
section the same condition pre
vails. It is not the season to
kill ducks, however, and unless
one of the "animals" attacks a
fellow and his life is in dauger,
he has no lawful right to shoot
it, no matter what damage they
may do his crop. Last year
there were so many ducks in the
Bard section that farmers lost
heavily on their account. A man
from the Imperial valley said
yesterday that every season they
infest that country to such an
extent thousands of dollars
worth of crops are destroyed.

Beginning with this session
the Nogales High School enters
upon a new era. The faculty
has been enlarged, the Junitor
High School organized, and
Supervised Study will be intro
duced. The enlarging of the faculty
permits us now to have a teach
er for each department. Here
tofore it has been necessary to
assign each teacher to at least
two departments.
The Junior High School has
been defined as an organization
of grades seven, eight, and nine
to provide by various means for
individual differences especially
by an earlier introduction of pre
vocational work and of subjects
usually taught in the high school
The organization of the Junior
High School in Nogales simply
means placing the seventh and
eighth grades under the manage
ment of the regular high school
teachers and allows these stud
ents to elect Latin, Spanish, or
Bookkeeping, in addition to the
regular work of those grades.
Within a year or two general
science and algebra will be in
troduced also in these grades.
The larger cities of the country
have introduced these subjects
into the upper grades and have
iound the work a success. Some
cities have called the organiza
tion the Intermediate school,
some the Junior High School,
and others have introduced the
work without giving it any spe
cial name. Nogales will be one
of three cities in this state hav
ing the Junior High School.
Globe has had it the past year
and Bisbee is organizing it this
year.
Playground equipment baa
been purchased and will soon be
installed for the primary pupils
as well as the High School. This
equipment includes giant strides,
swings, slides, horizonial bars,
flying rings, etc. The purchase
of playground equipment has
been under consideration for the
past three or four years but had
to be postponed from time to
time on account of lack of funds.
This year the Nogales High
School expects go be accredited
by the North Central Associa
tion of Colleges and Secondary
Schools. This association has
in its membership the leading
universities and colleges in ab
out twenty one states, member
ship requiring the meeting of
certain standards. The principal
high schools of the country have
met the requirements for being
accredited by the association.
The graduates of any high school
which is accredited by the asso
ciation are admitted to the col
leges and universities in the as
sociation without the usual en
trance examination. One of the
requirements that high schools
must meet is that the minimum
educational attainment of all
teachers of academic subjects
must be equivalent to gradua
tion from a college or university
belonging to the North Central
Association of Colleges and Sec
ondary Schools requiring the
completion of a four-year course
of study in advance of a stan
dard four-year high school
course. The teachers of the No
gales High School meet this re
quirement. Following is a list of the high
school teachers for the coming
year and the name of the school
from which each was graduated.
Mr. Raymond C. Gerber, Prin
cipal, Science, B. S. University
of Redlands.
Miss Maud PacPherson, Latin
B. A. University of Arizona.
Miss Louise Ohlbach, Mathe
matics B. A. University of Colo
rado. Miss Mary Corbin, Spanish B.
A. Occidental College.
Miss Anna Burt, English B.
A. University of Chicago.
Miss Jean Long, History B.
A. Stanford University.
Miss Elizabeth Jacobson, Com
mercial B. A. St. Olaf College.
G. H. Madden, Supt.
Railroad Will Tap New Timbnr Bait
The checking up work of the
preliminary survey of the pro
prosed Snowflake & White Moun
tain railroad is about completed.
Those in a position to know state
that grading and bridge building
will be started by October 1,
and that the construction of this
road will be rushed to comple
tion. It is estimated that train
service will be established to
Snowflake by July 4, 1918, or
not later than September of
1918.
The northern terminus of the
road will tap the Santa Fe main
line at Holbrook and the south
ern terminus at Cluff Cienega,
in the Sitgreaves national for
est, a distance of seventy miles.
This road will tap the finest
timber belt in the United States
and one of the finest bodies of
commercial timber in the world.
With a terminus at Cluff Cien
ega the road will be in the min
eral belt of Globe, Rice and
Clifton, giving an outlet to the
north from that section. This
road will become one of the im
portant railway lines in Arizona.

rangiag for a series of lectures
to be given in the extension

EUGENE S. IVES.
Eugene Semmes Ives, who
died suddenly in California Sat
urday evening, was a brilliant
and resourceful lawyer, who,
during his twenty years or more
residence in Arizona, made a re
cord in the judicial and political
annals of the state which will
live after him.
Senator Ives' career in Ariz
ona is full of interest. Locating
first in Yuma country, his legal
ability attracted the attention of
Colonel Randolph, and they be
came associated in mining and
other interests. Moving to Tuc
son, he became associated in the
practice of law with Mark Smith,
then the leading Democratic pol
itician of the state.
Senator Ives became general
counsel for the Southern Pacific
company's subsidiary corpora
tions in Arizona. He built up a
wide reputation as a corporation
lawyer and was the leading
counsel in a number of celebrat
ed cases, among them the South
ern Pacific-Santa Fe case involv
ing the Gila Canyon route, the
Steinfeld Zeckendorf case, the
California Development company
case and other large actions.
Senator Ives was a compan
ionable fellow, liberal to a
fault, resourceful before a jury,
public-spirited, and a loyal De
mocrat. He was a good fighter,
but hated to lose. He always
respected an opponent who put
up a good fight. This newspaper
opposed him in all of his polit
ical ambitions, but he was game
in politics and never took per
sonal offense in a political fight.
The passing of Senator Ives is
a great loss to Tucson and the
State. It is a loss to the Demo
cratic party whose cause in Ari
zona he so staunchly upheld.

a legal holiday, Monday, Sept
ember the third, nineteen seven
teen, to be duly celebrated as
aforetime.
In this most critical hour in
the history of the United States
and the civilized world, the
hopes and fears of humanity
center inevitably upon the at
titude of the forces of Labor to
ward the achievement of that
highest standard of efficiency,
without which Victory is im
possible. Therefore, this day affords a
most fitting and timely oppor
tunity to take stock of the re
sources of brain and hand, to
consider unselfishly how best we
can substantially evidence our
unfailing support to those who
will, at that very time, be mo
bilized to do battle for those
principles of liberty, equality
and fraternity which have bless
ed American Labor and borne it
upward to its present mighty
status.
Arizona's responsibility to do
her part in the present exigency
lies equally upon every member
of our citizenship. Snail we not
bury such differences as molest
our present industrial progress,
upon which so vitally depends
the success of the conflict, strain
ing our every nerve and sinew,
without thought of self, profit
or propaganda, until we shall
have won that to which we
strive worldwide democracy.
In Witness Whereof, I have
hereunto set my hand and caus
ed the Great Seal of the State
of Arizona to be affixed.
Done at Phoenix, the Capital,
this 27th day of August, A. D.,

the high cost of living have
been reduced to a minimum.

STOMACH TROUBLE
Mr. Marion Holcomb, of Nancy, Ky., says: "For quite
a long while I suffered with stomach trouble. I would
have pains and a heavy feeling after my meals, a most
disagreeable taste in my mouth. If I ate anything with
butter, oil or grease, I would spit it up. I began to have
regular sick headache. I had used pills and tablets, but
after a course of these, I would be constipated. It just
seemed to tear my stomach all up. I found they were
no good at all for my trouble. I heard
THEDFORD'S
recommended very highly, so began to use it. It cured
me. I keep it in the house all the time. It is the best
liver medicine made. 1 do not have sick headache or
stomach trouble any more." Black-Draught acts on
the jaded liver and helps it to do its important work of
throwing out waste materials and poisons from the sys
tem. This medicine should be in every household for
use in time of need. Get a package today. If you feel
sluggish, take a dose tonight. You will feel fresh to
morrow. Price 25c a package. All druggists.
