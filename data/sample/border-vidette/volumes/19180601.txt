G. W. Stroze, a Bisbee street
car motorman, was convicted in
the United Slates district court
recently on a charge of sedition.
He is a native born American,
but his father was born in Ber
lin. Witnesses testified that he
said that the president had sold
the country to the "Cousin
Jacks" and that all he owed the
United States was the difference
of the wage he could earn here
and elsewhere.
For the past month the Salt
River valley has been furnishing

The presence of smallpox in
two Mexican homes in the rural
district of Roosevelt, south of
Phoenix, has resulted in a com
plete stoppage of traffic with
Phoenix, under orders of the
county physician, who justifies
his drastic order on the ground
that the community could ill
afford to let the disease strike
one of the 500 men who are to
leave this city on the 27th for
Camo Cody. Guards have been
placed on the South Center
street bridge.
Mrs. Harry C. Wheeler, wife
of Captain H C. Wheeler, with
the American Expeditionary
Forces in France, has received
two letters from the Captain
within the past several days.
Both stated that he was getting
along nicely and has several
hundred reserve men under his
command, preparing them for
duty at the front. He states
that he is already tired of play
ing "feather bed" soldier away
from the front and expects or
ders for himself and command
to get into active duty at the
front soon. Prospector.
THE RATION BARD PLAN.
"The ration card system for the
flour and bread as adopted by
the Phoenix Retail Grocers' as
sociation and the association re
presenting Mesa and other
Southside towns, has proven to
be of such practical value in
limiting the consumption of
wheat to six pounds per person
per month that we shall imme
diately recommend it to Wash
ington with the request that it
be made statewide in applica
tion." This statement was issued by
the executive secretary of the
federal food administration for
Arizona, following a fully at
tended meeting of the merchants
of Phoenix and vicinity held at
the Water Users' building.
The purpose of the meeting
was to ascertain in what parti
culars the ration card plan could
be improved. Don t change it
in any particular, jo is gooa
enough as it stands. It is work
ing out with far less friction
than we ever supposed that it
would" was the concenses of
opinion.
One point emphasized is that
the plan has actually cut the
sale of wheat flour and bread in
half, and if this saving can be
effected over the state, there
need be no fear but what the
present supplies in Arizona will
suffice until harvest, despite the
fact that this state is supplying
the allies and the expeditionary
forces with 3,000,000 pounds of
flour, as its patriotic contribu
tion toward winning the war.
A resolution was adopted pe
titioning the food administration
to issue request that all grocery
stores be closed Sundays in the
interest of food conservation and
elimination of waste. Gazette.
It is a remarkable fact that
Arizona Indian boys now are to
be found scattered on scores of
the ships of the American navy.
Possibly because of the contrast
with the native conditions, the
navy has been especially popul
ar in the enlistment of adven
turous Indian youth, of whom a
dozen or more have gone to sea
from the Phoenix Indian school
alone. More of the redskins are
in the Arizona infantry regi
ment, the 148th at Camp Kear
ny, and are making good sol
diers. Originally there was a
solid company of them, nearly
all well drilled at the Indian
School.
During the civil war, two com
panies , of Pima and Maricopa
Indiana were enlisted as volun
teers and still later Indian in
fan try icompanies were recruited
at San Carlos and attached to
commands of regular troops. In
dians have always been a mate
rial part of the enlisted strength
of the Arizona National Guard
regiment, which, for several
years, was led by the Indian
School band. Arizona.
TOO HEAVY A CALL ON ARIZONA
Arizona thus far has sent ab
out 7000 men to the colors in the
great iwar. She has assessed
about 54000 for the last draft.
There was protest against what
appeared to be discrimination,
but her representatives were in
formed the Census Bureau had
figured out her population and
that the call must be on that
basis. Nothing availed a plea
that the state contains 40,000 In
dians, on reservations, and about
that same number of alien Mex
ican laborers, not to speak of
the large alien strength around
the mines. So, when the ex
emptions were made and the
aliens "all had been set aside,
about 40 per cent more than
Arizona's just proportion of fine
sturdy young fellows marched
away. The injustice of the sys
tem has been appreciated by
Provost Marshal Crowder, who
is supporting congressional ac
tion that will base the draft
quota of each district on men in
Class 1, instead of on popula
tion. Arizona.
WISE WERE THE PEOPLE.
Wise were the American peo
ple when they re elected Wood
row Wilson to the presidency
for the second time. Few men,
no matter how great they may
have made themselves in the
business world, could have
brought together such an organ
ization of men as now heads all
departments of the government.
And few men would have been
big enough to have called his
political antagonist to lead in
the investigation of the failure
of the aircraft board to make
good, which organization was
the the pet proposition of the
War Department. The calling
in of Charles E. Hugher to con
duct this investigation shows
that Wilson is bigger than his
party and bigger than any man
in public life today. Not only
has he been above political in
fluence, but all his acts and do
ings since the war began and
prior thereto have shown him
to be the one remarkable man
of the age. When history is
written the name of Woodrow
Wilson will be among the great
est men of the world in any
generation. Miner.
ANOTHER HOLIDAY.
Asking the co operation of all
people in making an entire sue
cess the day of registration June
5 of all young men who have be
come 21 years of age since June
5 of last year, President Wilson
has issued a proclamation which
has been sent to all local and
district boards of every state.
Councils of defense, both state
and county, all city, county,
state and national officers and
civic organizations have been in
cluded in the list of persons and
organizations called upon to ex
ert every effort to make the day
a holiday in character and bring
out a full registration of all eli
gible persons.

The Trench mine, near Har
shaw, is shipping high grade
silver ore, which is now being
hauled to Patagonia.
. The Hardshell mine is ship
ping ore. The output at pre
sent is not large, but it is esti
mated that in a short time the
mine will be sending out 50 or
more tons a day.
Brock Shannon, one of the
owners of the Exposed Reef
mine in Alum Gulch, has return
ed to Patagonia from Duncan,
Arizona, and will remain inde
finitely in this district.
"Shorty" Lewis is in from the
Viceroy mine, which has tem
porarily suspended operations,
awaiting word from the stock
holders in the east regarding
further development.
John Hoy, manager of the
Trench mine at Harshaw, re
turned last Saturday from a visit
to San Francisco, where he at
tended a meeting of the board
of directors of the Trench Con
solidated Mines Co.
Woody Rountree, one of the
men operating the Eureka mine,
was in Patagonia Tuesday. He
has lately taken an option on
the Bonanza group of claims,
near the Dixie, and work has
been started on the newly t.c
quired property to determine its
value.
The World's Fair mine is build
ing a wagon road of easy grade
from the mine to the railroad.
Right of-way has been obtained
from the owners of claims in the
Flux canyon, where the road is
being built, and the haul will be
materially shortened, as com
pared to the route through Har
shaw.
The Mowry mino is still re
timbering the old workings, and
much high grade manganese ore
is in sight, and as soon as the
shaft is properly timbered work
will begin on the ore bodies.
Mr. W. J. Mitchell, manager of
the mine, says the ore will run
as high as 45 per cent man
ganese. Patagonia is to be congratul
ated on its Second Red Cross
War Fund effort. Our quota of
the county's $4000 was over sub
scribed before noon on Monday.
At present the amount raised in
Patagonia is between $900 and
$1000, with some of the outlying
districts to hear from. It is the
first time that Patagonia has
been given a quota to handle,
and the way our committee went
at the work demonstrates that
we are willing to do our part
when it comes to raising funds
to secure for our soldiers the
necessary backing at home.
THE ECONOMY OF VICTORY.
No matter what this war costs
the government and the people
of the United States in the way
of money, it is going to be much
cheaper to win this war than to
lose it.
The commercial and financial
losses that would follow a Ger
man victory are not to be calcu
lated. All that we spent would
be lost, indemnities beyond cal
culation would have to be paid,
and along with these losses
would come a continuing loss in
foreign commerce that would
spell disaster.
With these material losses we
would lose our national liberty
and independence, our power to
secure our international rights,
our right to live in a world ruled
by the dictates of humanity aud
civilzatioc. Graham Guardian.
C. Louise Boehringer, of Yu
ma, has been appointed by Tim
othy A. Riordan, Federal Food
Administrator for Arizona, as
State leader of college women
and at once will start a thorough
organization among the college
women of the state to assist in
carrying out the food conserva
tion program, especially in the
homes.
Prohibition advocates tell us
that moderate drinking cuts fif
teen years off the average man's
life. This is probably the rea
son why that jocund young man
Chauncey Mitchel Depew, de
spite his eighty fourth birthday,
is hale, hearty and full of opti
mism. He has been a moderate
drinker all his life. So he is
really only sixty-nine years old.
Of course if he had been com
pelled by prohibitory laws to re
frain from the wine cup he
would doubtless now be ninety
nine, but he probably doesn't
worry about that. Galapage's
turtles live to be 200 years old.
because they nt;ver drink alco
holic beverages, but who wants
to be a turtle, and it is a ques
tion whether a turtle gets as
much fun oat of life as our
Chauncey has had during the
few years that his bad habits
have allowed him to live. Alco
holic liquors are poison, say the
alleged "scientists" who note
the effect of alcohol fumes on
guiene pigs. Mr. Depew has
been poisoned these many years
but hasn't found it out yet. Ex.
WAR IS
A soldier in the English army
wrote home: "They put me in
the barrack; they took away my
clothes and put me in khaki;
they took away my name and
made me 'No. 575'; they took me
to church, where I'd never been
before, and they made me listen
to a sermon ior forty minutes.
Then the parson said: 'No. 575
Art thou weary, art thou lan
guid?' and I got seven days in
the guardhouse because I ans
wered that I certainly was."

After one of the most active
municipal campaigns witnessed
here in many years, the Demo
cratic hosts of Nogales precinct
number one, last Monday swept
six out of seven candidates for
the Common Council into office
by handsome majorities. Wirt
G. Bowman, the highest, re
.ceived 398 out of a possible 080,
and the lowest 350. By the
small magin of seven, Mr. Bra
cey Curtis, Republican, defeated
Mr. W. H. Smith, Democrat.
From early morning until the
polls closed at 0 o'clock, party
leaders, men and women, work
ed like Trcjans, getting out the
vote,. with the result that of the
753 voters registered, 080 went
to the polls. Everybody was
anxious to cast a ballot, and the
voting was fast and furious.
There were a number of chal
lenges and several votes were
rejected by the election board;
a few were sworn in.
While there was great activity
among the party workers on
both sides, there was absolutely
no bitterness or personal feeling
evidenced at any time.
Fourteen of Nogales' best citi
zens were being voted for
seven on the Republican ticket,
seven on tha Democratic ticket.
Only seven candidates could win.
Seven must lose.
On account of having a perfect
campaign organization, and. be
cause there are more Democrats
than Republicans in Nogales,
the party of Jefferson and Wil
son swept everything before it,
winning six out ot a possible
seven.
Of the ballots cast, there were
263 straight Democratic voters
as against 189 straight Republi
can tickets, with 234 scratched.
The Democrats had kept the
faith, so had the Republicans,
men of both parties who never
before cast a straight ticket, did
so Monday last, and as always
is the case in Nogales, the De
mocrats won, thereby defeating
as good a bunch of Republican
citizens as ever ran for office in
any town.
For the splendid results much
credit is due the members of the
Democratic Municipal Commit
tee. These are they: Chairman
C. L. Hardy, Members Frank J.
Duffy, Dr. W. F. Chenoweth, T.
J. Wylie, J. A. Legarra, Lou
Koller, and Victor Wager.
The Ladies' Committee, of
which Mrs. James A. Harrison, is
the efficient, enthusiastic chair
man, also deserves great "gobs"
of praise.
Now that the election is over,
let everybody, Republicans and
Democrats, get behind the town
trustees, and work for a bigger
and better Nogales, the affairs
of which for the next two years,
will be conducted by the follow
ing gentlemen: Wirt G. Bow
man, R. E. Butler, George W.
Dunbar, George H. Fiedler, T.
M. Ford, Jr., James A. Harrison
and Bracey Curtis. They will
made good.
CHANGE OF TRAIN TIME.
Changes were announced in
the Southern Pacific time tables
that will affect the arrival of the
Tucson - Nogales trains. The
changes will become effective
tomorrow and are as follows:
Train No. 12 will leave Tucson
for Nogales at 8:35 a. m., in
stead of 8:05 a. m., arriving at
Nogales at 11.-10 a. rn.; return
ing, No. 11 will leave Nogales
3:05 p. m., instead of 2:05 p. m.,
arriving Tucson 5:40 p. m., in
stead of 4:40 p. m., as at pre
sent.
"OVER THE TOP."
Thanks to the untiring efforts
of workers in every section of
the county, and generous con
tributions from citizens of No
gales, Sonora, the Red Cross
drive in this section, went over
the top in line shape, more than
five thousand dollars having
been donated.
From every section of the
county excellent results were
obtained, as seen by the follow
ing list furnished by Mr. Bracey
Curtis:
Nogales, $3,229.22.
Patagonia, $830.00.
Washington Camp, $357.50.
Nogales, Sonora, $327.25.
San Rafael, $209.00.
Scnoita, $120.36.
Tubac, $76.00.
Santa Cruz county can always
be depended upon to do her
share for the good old U. S. A.,
and the drive to go over the top
with our quota in the Thrift
Stamps, is now holding the at
tention of everyone. Now is the
time that every true American
is expected to do his or her
duty, by investing in Thrift
Stamps.
OFF FOR CAMP CODY.
Last Monday the last contin
gent of boys in Santa Cruz coun
ty's Class One, entrained here
for Camp Cody, New Mexico,
where they will become a part
of the great National Army.
There were six boys from No
gales, one from Tombstone and
one from Los Angeles. Harry
E. Chenoweth acted as Captain
of the squad of splendid young
Americans all of whom carried
with them the best wishes of
everybody in Santa Cruz county.
Those who went from Nogales
were: Harry E. Chenoweth,
James D. Cumming, Frank Wil
son, Francisco Toden worth, Olaf
R. Pranzen and Al. H. Hale.
Hugo Mulkey went from Tomb
stone, and H. A. Cole went from
Los Angeles.
The boys were given a rous
ing send off by relatives and
friends who were at the depot
to wish them good bye and good
luck.
The kind - hearted patriotic
ladies of Nogales did not forget
the good things to eat, and the
boys went on their way prepar
ed "for the worst."
They are a fine bunch. All
will be heard from, when the
time to go over the top comes.

MEXICAN MASONS GENEROUS.
Lodges Make Liberal Donations to
American Red Cross.
The Masonic Lodge, "Alonso
Flores," No. 10, of Nogales,
Sonora, has donated to the
American Red Cross fund, rais
ing in Nogales and Santa Cruz
county, Arizona, the handsome
sum of $111, which was deposit
ed to the credit of the fund,
through Mr. Bracey Curtis, the
chairman of the Red Cross drive
committee, says the Oasis.
At the same lime there was
deposited with Mr. Curtis, in
the same capacity, the gratify
ing sum of 8100, contributed by
Hermosillo Lodge, No, 19, of
Hermosillo, Sonora.
Both of the lodges named are
of the Scottish Rite, and they
number in their membership
many of the most prominent and
best known citizens of the state
of Sonora.
In those and in other dona
tions to the Red Cross fund,
coming from the Mexican peo
ple, noted in these columns,
there is an earnest of the real
sentiment that exists on the
south side of International ave
nue in Nogales. Since Ameri
can newspapers have quit abus
ing Mexicans and their leading
representative men, the people
of Sonora have been quick in
seizing opportunities to show
their friendliness and sincere in
terest in the effort now exer
cised by the United States to
make the world safe for demo
cracy. FOR STATE SENATOR
