OUR MOTTO:- "THE BEST OF EVERYTHING."
THE THIRD LEGISLATURE.
Best Session Ever Held Is the Univer
sal Verdict.
Shortly after 3 o'clock this
morning (March 10th) the third
state legislature completed its
work, and after the usual period
of felicitation, expression of good
will and giving presents, ad
journed sine die. The general
appropriation bill which pro
vides liberally for all the instit.u
tions of the state and wipes out
the slate of indebteness, passed
and went to the governor. The
county classification bill which
fixes salaries of officials in the
various counties of the state was
the last measure to meet agree
ment. With the passage of these
two measures, the necessity of
any extra session is averted un
less something unforeseen hap
pens. The third legislature passed
many bills and the list of re
medial and beneficial measures
enacted shows the effect of good
work and concentration of ef
forts. This will go down in his
tory as the best and most busi
ness like session ever held in
Arizona either as a state or ter
ritory. The early weeks were
frittered away but the last half
was devoted to business. There
were no factions visible despite
misrepresentation of the daily
press, when the de facto gover
nor was selected, all went to
work with a will.
Senator Roberts of the senate
and John McCormick of the
house, as heads of the respective
appropriation committees, work
ed faithfully and effectively. In
this they were assisted by most
of trie members.
Bill creating a state commis
sion under direct control of the
governor, to have charge and
control of all the institutions of
the state was passed. It does
away with the board of control
and other boards.
Minimum wage bill for wo
men, fixing the gauge at $10 was
passed. Mrs. McKay champion
ed the bill in the house. When
it reached the senate it was
taken in charge by Senator Ma
honey of Mohave, one of the
best friends of labor ever sent to
an Arizona legislature.
The mothers' pension bill in
mild form, so ably supported by
Mrs. Marsh of Santa Cruz, was
rescued in the senate at the
eleventh hour through efforts of
Senator Rutherford and under
his skillful guidance it finally
passed.
Vaugn and Walton of Maricopa
by clever team work finally
secured the passage of the $30,
000 appropriation for a building
at the fair grounds, to house the
mining exhibit. The bill, under
suspension of the rules passed
both houses and was the last
measure to get through.
All the schools, the University,
the Northern Arizona Normal
school and the Tempe Normal
school were liberally cared for.
So were all the state institu
tions, asylums, prison and in
dustrial school.
It is impossible at this time to
give even an approximate list of
all laws enacted. Provision was
made to buy the gubernatorial at
Prescott.
The capitol building gets $125,
000 with which to complete the
building.
Schools for feeble minded; also
for deaf, dumb and blind failed,
although these measures held
favorable place on the calender.
Bills signed by the governor
during the night were in part as
follows:
Senate Bill No. 93. This bill
provides for a $3000 appropria
tion to complete and equip the
female ward at the state hospital
for the insane.
Senate Bill No. 72. This bill
provides for the Pinal Lumber
and Hardware company and
makes an appropriation there
for. House Bill No. 105, which
provides for the purchase and
restoration of the old guberna
torial mansion at Prescott.
House Bill No. 175, which
creates county highway commis
sions and makes an appropria
tion therefor.
Senate Bill No. 63 which re
gulates the buying and selling
of securities by brokers or
through exchanges or boards of
trade or other public markets.
This bill will also makes it ne
cessary for brokers to take out
state licenses. It also provides
that bucketing be defined and
prohibited, and fixes penalties
therefor".
House Bill No. 197. This is
an act to amend paragraph 4877,
title 49, of the revised statutes
of 1913, and will make assess
ment lists a part of the assess
ment rolls and provides that
tbey shall be return ad to the
assessor after a certain period.
House Bill No. 3, which fixes
a minimum wage of $10 for wo
men of the state and fixes, a
penalty for violation of the law.
This is considered one of the
most important acts of the le
gislature. Gov. Campbell presented Mrs.
McKey, mother of the bill, with
the gold pen with which the
measure was signed. His note
accompanying the bequest was
spread upon the minutes.
Senate Bill No. 64, an act to
revise the revenue laws of this
state relative to the assessment,
levy, equalization and collection
of taxes.
House Bill No. 192, which ap
propriates $2000 for the painting
of portraits of certain members
of the legislature.
Senate Bill No. 78, which ap
propriates $500 in favor of Con
P. Cronin for attorney fees in
connection with the 1915 legisla
tive session.
House Bill No. 148, which
provides for a game refuge, to
be known as the Blue Range
game preserve.
House Bill No. 159, which
provides for a game refuge to be
knowmas the Pinal Mountains
game preserve.
Hous.e Bill No. 194 provides
for a revision of and compilation
of the school laws of the state
of Arizona and creates a commis
sion of three tc carry out the
provisions of this act. A sum of
$600 is appropriated therefor.
Senate Bill No. 60, which
provides for the assessment of
certain irrigation districts to
conform with an' act of con
gress, entitled "An act to pro
mote reclamation of airid lands,"
passed August 11, 1916.
Senate Bill No. 60, creating
irrigation districts in reclama
tion projects and making lands
therein patented and unpatented
lands liable to assessment.
House Bill 194, providing for
a revision of the school laws and
creating a commission to investe
and report to the next session of
the legislature.
Several measures of merit
failed for lack of time but none
of these are of vital import.
Arizona will have no regrets
that the session is closed; neit
her is there cause for complaint
because of enactments made.

ARIZONA NOTES.
Items of Interest Culled From Our
Exchanges.
Tucson is to have a municipal
play ground and athletic park,
the city council having appro
priated at a recent meeting
$2,000 for that purpose. This is
a move in the right direction
and the investment will be re
paid in time a thousand fold.
The matter of an historical
pageant for Tucson has been
taken up by the luncheon club
of this city. The idea is to have
a pageant representing the four
historical eras through which
Tucson has passed, the Indian,
Spanish, Mexican and American.
Discussion revealed the belief
that this ought not to be held
earlier than year hence.
A, movement on foot here for
some time to acquire a city water
plant has taken a definite step
forward this week when the town
council of Williams decided to
obtain appraisement of the
property of the water company.
The application was made the
Arizona Corporation Commis
sion. The company holds the
sale price of the property at
$125,000.
The Botony Department of the
Experiment Station. Univer
sity of Arizona, has recently
issued a little publication enti
tled "Roses for the Home." This
treats, in particular, of perpect
ual or ever-blooming roses in
hybrid perpetual roses, ram
biers, and China and Bengal
roses. The varieties which are
named have been proved hardy
for Arizona conditions over a
period of several years time and
include some of the finest roses
that are grown. There is also a
fine list of hardy ever-blooming
climbing roses, which are always
appreciated.
The biggest tourist hotel pro
ject ever planned for Arizona,
carrying with it an expenditure
of $350,000, has just become
known. The Southern Pacific
railroad is going to erect on the
shores of Roosevelt lake the
biggest and most luxurious hotel
in the Southwest. It has been
announced that land to the ex
tent of several hundred acres
had been leased and that the
hotel would be completed within
the next nine months. As plan
ned by the Southern Pacific, the
new hotel will occupy the site of
the Webb Lodge, which at pre
sent does service as a hostelry
at the dam.
Woodrow Wilson 28th President.
THE YUMA VALLEY.
Woodrow Wilson is the 28th
president of the United States,
reckoning Cleveland's two terms
as separate ones because he
was the only president serving
twice who was not reelected.
Virginia leads in the nativity
of presidents. Eight of her
sons Washington, Jefferson,
Madison, Monroe, William Hen
ry Harrison, Tyler, Taylor and
Wilson have held the highest
office in the gift of the nation.
Ohio has given six native sons
to the presidency. They were
Grant, Hayes, Garfield, Ben
gamin Harrison, McKinley and
Taft.
Of all the vocations in life th6
law has furnished most presi
dents. Nineteen chief executives
of the United States were law
yers at the time they were elect
ed. Three are classified as
statesmen; two as soldiers, two
as farmers, one as a public of
ficial. Seventeen presidents have
been college men; one was grad
uated from West Point, nine had
no collegiate education.
English paternal ancestry has
predominated among all the
presidents. Fifteen were of
English extraction. Six were
Scotch-Irish, three were Scotch,
two were Dutch, one was Welsh.
The youngest president, at the
time of inauguration was Roose
velt, who was 46. The oldest
was William Henry Harrison,
who was 68.
Of all the presidents John Ad,
ams lived to the oldest age. He
was 90 when he died. Miner.
The Yuma Valley of Arizona,
under national reclamation has
forged rapidly to the front as
one of the rich and fertile re
gions of the Southwest. The
change from the old haphazard
methods which prevailed during
the period when private irriga
tion systems were operated to
the present condition of inten
sive and practical farming under
the government canals is mark
ed. This change is particularly
gratifying to the Reclamation
Service at Washington, D. C.
Last year's crop report is a
most interesting document, and
predicates in a measure the re
sults which will obtain when
100,000 acres are prepared for
crop. In 1916 the total area
cropped was 28,283 acres, and
the gross returns amounted to
$1,435,403, or an average of
$50.75 per acre. Alfalfa consti
tuted the most important crop in
acreage and gross returns, the
yield of hay on 10,880 acres be
ing $266,898, or $25 per acre,
and from seed grown on 8,100
acres the returns were $328,725,
or $i0.57 per acre.
The highest average return
was from cotton and seed, $600
per acre. On 4670 acres $2,289,
430 lbs. of cotton, or an average
of 490 lbs. per acre were pro
duced, and the gross value was
$397,420. The average yields
per acre of other crops were as
follows: Beans, $44; Truck, $74;
Indian corn, $24; Corn sorghum,
$25; Wheat, $22. The best evid
ence of better farming is shown
by the fact that the average re
turn per acre in 1916 was 45 per
cent greater than for 1915.
The Yuma project, with its
twelve months of growing sea
son, its abundance of water, and
comparatively cheap priced land,
offers a splendid opportunity for
the farmer who is looking for a
home where winter snows and
summer drouths never come.
Baca Land Grant Hearing Is Set Fcr
April.
April 10 has been set as the
date for the Baca Float assess
ment hearing before the state
tax commission, when owners
of land in Santa Cruz county will
attempt to secure a reduction in
back taxes. The hearing will
be conducted in Nogales.
Owners of land in the Baca
Float district have raised objec
tions to the assessments of the
past many years, the aggregate
of which is almost $1,000,000, It
is stated.
The ownership of these lands
has been contested for the past
several years, the matter only
recently being straightened out
by the courts. During the period
that the court battles were tak
ing place no taxes were collect
ed. Now the persons who have
been declared the legal owners
of the land are objecting to pay
ing the back taxes. Judge Camp
bell of Tucson is representing
the owners of the north half,
while owners of the south half
are being represented by Judge
Samuel L. Kingman, also of
Tucson.

There arc times in every woman's life when she
needs a tonic to help her over the hard places.
When that time comes to you, you know what tonic

posed of purely vegetable ingredients, which act
gently, yet surely, on the weakened womanly organs,
and helps build them back to strength and health.
It has benefited thousands and thousands of weak,
ailing women in its past half century of wonderful
success, and it will do the same for you.
You can't make a mistake in taking

Miss Amelia Wilson, R. F. D. No. 4, Alma, Ark.,
says: "I think Cardui is the greatest medicine on earth,
for women. Before I began to take Cardui, I was
so weak and nervous, and had such awful dizzy
spells and a poor appetite. Now I feel as well and
as strong as I ever did, and can eat most anything."
Begin taking Cardui today. Sold by all dealers.
