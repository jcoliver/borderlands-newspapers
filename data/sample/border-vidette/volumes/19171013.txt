THE TOWN SLACKER.
In every town, just as in every
lodge or church or club, there
are a few people who, the slack
ers always say, "think they run
things," or "want to run things."
Let us consider these men and
women who "think they run
things," or "want to run things."
Are they not the people who,
when there is a lot of committee
or detail work to be done, are
the only ones who will do it?
Are they not the only ones who
are willing to give their time
and their energy for a public
movement for the good of all?
When you analyze the whole
thing are not these people, who
"think they run things" about
the only people who have enough
interest in their town or their
lodge or their church to spend
their time and njpney for the
good of others?
If you are honest with your
self you will admit they are.
The next time you hear, any one
talk about the other fellow run
ning the lodge or the town or
church or the fire company ask
him to come to the next meeting
of one of these organizations;
see that he is appointed on one
of the committees which have a
lot of work for the good of the
order or the town and watch
him try to crawl out of the job
of working for nothing for the
good of others. You will find
that he is perfectly willing to
let the hard workers "think they
run things," or "run things."

Two Schools for Sonora Orphans.
A proclamation has just been
issued by General Calies, gov
ernor of Sonora, asking the peo
ple of the state to raise $3000
with which to build two schools
for orphan children.
It is the plan of Gen. Calles,
as outlined in the proclamation,
to build two schools at Hermb
sillo for the accommodation of
the orphans of the state. There
is one orphanage at Hermosillo
at this time, but it is said it is
not large enough to accommo
date all of the orphans of the
state, and the plan is to build
two additional buildings.
According to information' re
ceived from the capital of the
state, the two proposed school
buildings are to be the best in
point of modern convenience, in
Northern Mexico. It is planned
to install an electric light for
the buildings.

A Few Serious, Interesting and Simply
Told Facts About Our Country.
. ' f
The total yearly income of all
the people in this country is es
timated at forty billion dollars.
During the first year of the
war we must find eighteen and
one half billion dollars, or about
forty-seven dollars that we earn.
These figures are astounding,
but we can "get by," and if you
will read on you will see how
we are going to do it.
There are two ways, in which
the government will raise this
money by taxation and by bor
rowing money from you.
The more the government will
allow you to loan, to it the less
it will have to tax you right
now. Therefore, ease your tax
ation by buying a Liberty Bond.
Argument about facts which
have been mentioned is useless.
We are in the war; we must win,
and to do it the money must be
found.
This is how we are going to
find the money: By economiz
ing and saving.
Duty demands it; common
sense advises it, and the govern
ment calls upon you to do it.
Waste and extravagance must
go, and the money so saved
loaned to the government or
given up to them in taxes to
carry on the war.
Give up the money you waste
on the "un necessaries" of life,
and buy a Liberty Bond with it.
You will be putting by for a
rainy day and serving your
country at the same time.
Many people in the Eleventh
Federal District have money
they do not need until spring.
They should lotn it to the gov
ernment at good interest. It is
good business and good Americanism.
You do your part with your
money when you buy a Liberty
Bond. The bond is as good as
money; it is yours to borrow on;
to sell, or to do as you like with.
It pays good interest, too.
Taxes never come back; they
pay no interest; they are a dead
expense.
Again we say, ease out your
taxation by buying a Liberty
Bond.
Do not be scared at having to
find all this money. Billions of
it will be paid back to the farm
ers and workmen of this coun
try. Billions will be loaned to
our Allies at interest and will
form a huge national bank ac
count, which we can draw upon
later. This country is in the
position of a man who has to
deny himself in order to keep
his business going, but who will
make a fortune if only be has
sense enough to put up the
money when it is needed.
The patriotic appeal of the
loan is so clear that it does not
need to be hammered at.
Our boys are giving their
lives; our friends and allies their
money and their lives; the whole
civilized world is fighting that
Right and not Might, shall rule,
that the world shall be made a
safe place for honest men, wo
men and little children, to live in.
To keep insisting that you, as
an American, should support
such a cause, is quite unneces
sary. The answer to the call of
the Liberty Loan is to be found
in your common sense and in
your heart.
Think over very seriously and
very carefully these few serious,
interesting, and simply told facts
about our country, the war and
the Liberty Loan. Then do your
duty to yourself and to your
country Buy a Liberty Bond.

State fair dates November 12-17.
The "Boys Sports" will be one
of the more or less continuous
performances at the state fair,
November 12-17.
There will be a neck and neck
contest between dry-farming and
wet-farming at the state fair
this year, November 12 17.
The boys and girls whose club
work has hitherto attracted so
much attention at the fair will
break into the pig pen this year.
Handsome prizes are offered for
the best hog fattened by a boy
and the best one fattened by a
girl.
If the track records and world
records are not frightfully shat
tered at the Arizona State Fair,
November 12-17, the finest ag
gregation of horses and horse
men in the west, will all be
mightily ashamed of themselves
for they will be among "those
present" and will be held re
sponsible. The harness races
call for $15,000 more money than
last year. That is some induce
ment to speed.
'Britisher' Is Drafted Into Army.
The first alien to be forced in
to the ranks of the United States
army will leave today nnder
guard of City Tax Collector
Wood, specially detailed to tbe
local board, for Camp FunstOn,
at Fort Riley, Kansas, says tbe
Tucson Star.
The man is Garth Daniels of
Tucson, who said he was an En
glish subject and therefore con
sidered that he was privileged
to ignore the demand upon him
by the local board to appear for
physical examination. It is said
he wrote some letters to tbe
local board of a defiant nature.
The local board secured the ad
vice of the war department and
he is being sent to tbe camp
forthwith nnder tbe direction of
the department, which had is
sued orders that those who did
not appear' when called for ex
amination should be sent to
camp forthwith, regardless of all
claims.
William Krause, who register
ed and did not show up when
called to go with the third con
tingent, will lead a contingent
for Nogales today, the others
being four slackers belonging to
other points.
GET YOUR GRANDSTAND BOX.
The assignment of boxes in
the grandstand at the State Fair,
November 12 - 17, will occur
through the method of a public
drawing to be held at 10 o'clock
a. m. Thursday, October 25, in
tbe Chamber of Commerce rooms
in Phoenix, and under the au
spices of that body. Tbe cost
of a box for the entire week of
the Fair is only $25, the old time
price that prevailed before the
days of tbe high cost of living.
Those wanting boxes should
forward their money to B. W.
Zachau, secretary of the State
Fair Commission, Phoenix, stat
ing whether they will be able to
attend the drawing or designate
some one to draw for them.
Otherwise their names will be
given to the Chamber of Com
merce and some one will be de
signated to draw for them.
Drafted Men on Leave Go Next!
Places will be left in the fourth
contingent for all those who
have been discharged for periods
of from thirty days to six months
or more, according to orders re
ceived from Federal Agent
Breen at Phoenix by tbe district
board at Tucson.
It had previously been order
ed that those who had received
exemptions for periods extend
ing beyond the date of depart
ure of the last contingent would
go with the second draft if there
was a second draft.
Tbe new order means that if a
man's temporary discharge ex
pired even a year hence, he
would go to whatever camp
there is at that time as a mem
ber of the fourth contingent.
The significance of the order
is that there will be no second
draft, but that all registered
men will be examined and sent
when ordered. MEXICAN KILLS GREEK.

A BIG MASS MEETING.
Soldiers and Citizens Back JAmerica's
Boys at the Front.
At the patriotic meeting held
last night at the Lyric Theatre
the mammoth drive to back
A'm erica's boys at the front was
started off in fine snap, and
Santa Cruz county's quota $294.
400 is going to be taken in re
cord-making time, if- the pace
set last night by The First
National Bank of Nogales,
Frank Diamos, of The Nogales
Theatre, and soldiers of the 35th
Infantry, is maintained.
The big local bank subscribed
$70,000, ' the soldier boys under
Colonel Frier, commander of the
Nogales district, $50,000; Mr.
Diamos pledged $10,000, Wirt
6. Bowman $1,000, and others
declared themselves ready and
willing to back our boys with
their last dollar, if necessary.
The meeting was presided over
by Judge Frank J. Duffy, who
in a few appropriate remarks
introduced Colonel Frier com
mander of the American forces
in this district.
Colonel Frier made a splendid
talk daring which he told of how
members of the 35th regiment
and other soldiers of the Ameri
can army were doing their "bit"
for their country.
Attorney Frank J. Barry ex
plained the Liberty Boud, and
made a strong plea to the patrio
tic citizens of Santa Cruz county
for their subscription to the
Bonds, in order that our boys at
the front may receive the support
they must have to win the great
war now raging in Europe and
on the high seas.
Mr. Barry was followed by
Judge W. A. O'Connor, who told
a number of interesting stories
and explained the wonderful
political organization controlled
by the German kaiser, who has
gone blood-crazy. Judge O'Con
nor also told how the kaiser bad
"taken in too much territory,"
when he said he could whip the
whole world.
A short talk on patriotim, was
made by Mr. Ritterhouse, of
California, the silver-tongued
orator of the Pacific coast.
Music was furnished during
the eveing by the 35th Infantry
band and the Soldier Quartette.
Through the courtesy of Man
ager Frank Diamos, pictures of
"The Battle of the Somme,"
were shown at The Nogales
Theatre.
A PRETTY WEDDING.
Last Satusday night Colonel
Abelardo Rodriguez of the Mex
ican army, with headquarters on
the Yaqui river, Sonora, and
Miss Luisa Montijo of San
Francisco, were the high con
tracting parties at one of the
most elegant weddings witness
ed at the Church of the Sacred
Heart in many years.
Hundreds of admiring friends
and acquaintances of the happy
bridal couple, were unable to
crowd into the church.
After the wedding ceremony,
a reception and wedding supper
at the home of the groom's
brother, Mr. F. F. Rodriguez,
was enjoyed by relatives and
friends of Colonel and Mrs. Rod
riguez, who early Sunday morn
ing motored to Tucson, where
they took the westbound train
for California.
With them went the best
wishes of a host of friends.
"Conditions in Mexico Bright."
A press dispatch from Chica
go, dated October 11th, says:
Reports of a bright outlook
for the permanency of the Car
ranza government in Mexico
were brought here yesterday by
Gen. Alvaro Obregon of Mexico,
who arrived on his way to Wash
ington. He is accompanied by
Major Harvey W. Miller, U. S.
A., who met him at the border
and will go with him to Wash
ington. "Conditions in Mexico are very
good," General Obregon said.
"There are some, desultory ef
forts to harass the government,
but the Carranza regime is firm
ly established."
Obregon visited Colonel James
Ryan, commanding officer at
Fort Sheridan, with whom he
had been acquainted on the border.
Tuesday morning, in what is
claimed to have been a rille
duel, Louis Mihalouphoulos, a
well known Greek mine operat
or, who for some time .past has
been successfully operating the
Proto mine in the Patagonia
mountains a short distance from
Nogales, was shot three times by
Juan Moreno, and killed. The
sheriff's office was notified of the
shooting affair by Deputy Sheriff
Frank Cox at Duquesne, and
Sheriff Earhart immediately
rushed to the seene of the kill
ing, but arrived too late to ap
prehend Moreno, who made his
escape into Sonora, and has not
yet been apprehended. Bad
blood between the two men is
given as the cause of the fatal
duel. The body of the dead man
was brought to Nogales for
burial. The coroner's jury found
that "Louis Mihalouphoulos
came to his death from rifle
wounds presumably from the
hands ot Juan Moreno, while
the deceased and the said Juan
Moreno were engaged in a rifle
duel." The dead miner, who is
said to have fired the first shot,
was a very powerful man, being
six feet six inches tall. He was
known in this section as "Big
Mike." v

me a bottle of Cardul I would try It
I commended taking It, however, that
evening I called my family about
me. . . for I knew I could not last
many days unfess I had a change for
the better. That was six years ago
and I am still here and am a well,
strong woman, and I owe my life to
Cardul. I had only taken half tba
bottle when I began to feel better.
The misery in my side got less... I
continued right on taking the Cardul
until I had taken thiee bottles and I
did not need any more for I was well
end never felt better in my life ... I
have never had any trouble from that
day to this."
Do you suffer from headache, back
ache, pains In sides, or other discom
forts, each month? Or do you feel
weak, nervous and fagged-out? If so,
Cive Cardui, the woman's tonic, a
trial. J. 71

A. M. Conard, vice president
and general manager of the Son
ora Consolidated Mining and
Smelting Company, owning the
Cobre Grande copper mines and
smelter near Noria, Sonora, has
gone down to Cobre Grande,
where active operations will be
resumed next Monday, after
more than three year's idleness.
Immense bodies of ore are al
ready blocked out in tbe Cobre
Grande, and just as soon as
Manager Conard gets bis forces
in the mine and smelter re-organized,
tbe smelter near Noria
will commence producing red
metal, which at this time is so
badly needed by the United

In view of the fact that em

idle miners in Sonora, and bring
thousands of dollars to this city,
news of resumption of work at
Cobre Grande, under A. M.
Conard's able management, will
be learned with much pleasure

and his interesting family own a
fine residence in which they
lived before moving to Los An

'LOST NOTHING.
"Germany has lost nothing."
said the kaiser in one of his re
cent pronuneiamentos- intended
to cheer the weary and disheart
ened German people.
Well, only recently the Asso
ciated Press issued a carefully
compiled review of German mil
itary strength throughout the
war, showing that Germany has
lost altogether, in killed, per
manently disabled and prisoners
4,000,000 men. And besides,
there are 500,000 wounded now
in the hospitals.
Pour and one-half millions of
Germany's best manhood gone.
Is that nothing."
And yet that represents but a
small part of the losses, for Ger
many has forfeited what most
nations, like most men, value
more than life her good reputation.
