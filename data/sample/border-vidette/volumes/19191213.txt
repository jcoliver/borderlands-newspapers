COURTESY.
The Spirit of Friendship.
This store looks upon its patrons not
merely as customers but as friends.
People purchase here because they
have friendly feeling for this store.
The cause which develops this friendly
feeling, may differ, in fact, they are
sure to differ. One's friendship for
the store is the result of finding good
valaes; another's is the result of effi
cient service and courteous treatment,
and so on.
Naturally this friendshiply feeling on
the part of our patrons is reciprocated
on our part. And this spirit of mutual
friendship is an impetus for greater
service and an incentive to ever-increasing
endeavor to make this store
a place where every visitor will feel
perfectly at home.

ARIZONA NOTES.
Items of Interest Culled From Our
Exchanges.
A wire has been received by
Governor Campbell from the
Rocky Mountain club of New
York announcing the recent ar
rival from overseas duty of four
Arizonans; they are Elmer
Worth, of Yuma; Eugene D.
Campbell, of Parker; Marion R.
Martin, of Clarkdale and Ralph
Soule, of Phoenix.
Auto travelers passing through
tell the most harrowing tales of
their experience with bad roads
along the route. These bad spots
are not all in the vicinity of
Benson either, but travelers
from the west are pretty well
agreed that the road between
Vail and Benson would stand a
little improving. Benson Signal
The University College of
Agriculture purchased a ten
months old bull calf and a four
year old cow at the sale of re
gistered Hereford cattle during
State Pair week. These animals
were bred by W. B. Mitchell,
Marfa, Texas. They are a very
attractive addition to the small
herd already maintained at the
University farm.
"There has been no increase
in the tax levied on silver ore
or bullion exported from Mexico
and there is no likelihood of
such an increase," the Mexican
consul and inspector of customs
at Naco, Sonora, is quoted to
have stated. "The Mexican gov
ernment," he claimed in the in
terview, "has adopted a policy
calculated to attract American
capital into Mexico, and such a
tax would certainly send away
investors."
That a shortage of coal may
result in the closing of the big
reduction plant of the United
Verde Extension, is the state
ment credited to J. S. Douglas,
president of that corporation,
who passed through Douglas
yesterday on his way back to
Jerome. Unless the United Ver
de company can spare them
enough coal until preparations
for burning oil are completed
the big plant will be closed down
and thus throw several hundred
men out of work.
TOVBEA EMPLOYES LUCKY.
A substantial addition to the
things the employes of E. A.
Tovrea and company have to be
thankful for was made on
Thansgiving afternoon when Mr.
Tovrea called his employes to
gether and announced the adop
tion of a bonus system whereby
each employe who has been with
the company one year or more
will receive on Christmas day a
$100 share of stock of the com
pany of the Arizona Packing
Company, the new half-million
dollar packing plant now in
course of construction at Phoe
nix, Arizona, which will have a
capacity of 1,000 hogs daily.
Each employe will be given a
bonus of six per cent on salary
drawn during the year. If the
bonus amounts to $90 the bal
ance of $10 will be charged to
the employe on the books of the
company. If the bonus shall
amount to $120, the surplus of
$20 will be credited on the books.

SILVER SI.SO PER OUNCE.
Harry E. Simons, an eastern
mining promoter predicts $1.50
silver in the near future due to
the present shortage of that
metal. In an interview with a
representative of the "Boston
Copper News," an eastern min
ing publication, Simons said:
"The high price of silver is here
to stay. I do not believe $1.50
an ounce is too much to expect,
though I believe the Drice will
eventually . settle down around
parity level; I look on the way
silver has stood up in the market
flurry the middle of November
as of the most reassuring char
acter." Oddly enough, the price of
silver is climbing daily, because
of the accumulation of copper.
Silver is produced to an import
ant extent as a by product of
copper and the tendency to trim
the copper output because of the
piling up of the red metal is
making for a greater scarcity of
silver.
While it is difficult for copper
mines to make profits in face of
the temporary surplusage of
their product, lead quotations
are holding firm or advancing,
which with other conditions
means that the silver-lead prop
erties have increasing incentive
to push their productive facili
ties to the limit. For this reason
many Arizona -silver properties
which have lain idle in the past
are again under extensive de
velopment work.
AMERICANISM THE KEYNOTE.
Americanism is now the key
note of Elkdom, according to
Frank L. Rain, Grand Exalted
Ruler, who was a guest of the
Spokane (Wash.) B. P. O. E.,
and presided at the ceremonies
attending the laying of the cor
nerstone of the new Elks' tem
ple. "The Elks lodge is a distinct
ly American organization and it
stands unqualifiedly for Amer
icanism," said Mr. Rain. "With
our American ideals and prin
ciples being undermined by pro
paganda from anarchists, I. W.
W. and bolsheviki, there is a
noble function given to our
lodge, which we are accepting
gladly and enthusiastically.
With 600,000 red blooded Amer
icans in our order we expect to
preach the doctrine of Amer
icanism in every corner of the
United States, and to see that
our nation is preserved for Am
erican ideals."
Speaking at the corner-stone
ceremony, Joseph B. Lindsey, a
local member, expressed the
same ideas in these words:
"This is our home, our native
land, purchased and preserved
by the blood of our fathers and
our fathers' children, and no
foreign anarchist or demagogue,
preaching here the doctrines of
revolution, nor any local imbe
cile in sympathy with him, will
much longer be allowed to
breathe the air of free America."
A PROCLAMATION.
Whereas, by the Act of Con
gress approved March 3, 1919,
the Fourteenth Decennial Cen
sus of the United States is to be
taken beginning on the second
day of January, 1920; and
Whereas, a correct enumera
tion of the population every ten
years is required by the Consti
tution of the United States for
the purpose of determining the
representation of the several
States in the House of Repre
sentatives; and
Whereas, it is of the utmost
importance to the interests of
all the people of the United
States that this Census should
be a complete and accurate re
port of the population and re
sources of the Nation;
Now, therefore, I, Woodrow
Wilson, President of the United
States of America, do hereby
declare and make known that,
under the law aforesaid, it is the
duty of every person to answer
all questions on the census
schedules applying to him and
the family to which he belongs,
and to the farm occupied by him
or bis family, and that any per
son refusing to do so is subject
to penalty.
The sole purpose of the Cen
sus is to secure general statis
tical information regarding the
population and resources of the
country and replies are requiied
from individuals only to permit
the compilation of such general
statistics. No person can be
harmed in any way by furnish
ing the information required.
The Census has nothing to do
with taxation, with military or
jury service, with the compul
sion of school attendance, with
the regulation of immigration or
with the enforcement of any na
tional, state or local law or or
dinance. There need be no fear
that any disclosure will be made
regarding any individual person
or his affairs. For the due pro
tection of the rights and inter
ests of the persons furnishing
information every employee of
the Census Bureau is prohibited,
under heavy penalty, from dis
closing any information which
may thus come to his knowledge.
I therefore earnestly urge up
on all persons to answer prompt
ly, completely and accurately all
inquiries addressed to them by
the enumerators or other em
ployees of the Census Bureau
and thereby to contribute their
share toward making this great
and necessary public undertak
ing a success.
In Witness Whereof I have
hereunto set my hand and caus
ed the seal of the United States
to be affixed.
Done in the District of Colum
bia this tenth day of November,
in the year of our Lord one
thousand nine hundred and nine
teen, and of the independence of
the United States the one hun

COLONEL EPES RANDOLPH.
In a recent interview, Colonel
Epes Randolph, the well known,
patriotic Arizonian who com
mands the Red Cross Christmas
Seal sale, said:
"I believe that the work of
the Arizona Anti-Tuberculosis
Association as outlined in their
program for this year is excel
lent and peculiarly adaptable to
our State, which is blessed with
a health giving climate. Hun
dreds of people afflicted with
tuberculosis seek refuge here
every year, and humanity de
mands that we do whatever we
can to help these sufferers. I
can conceive of no better way in
which to raise funds for this
purpose than to ask our people
to buy Red Cross Christmas
seals. It is a democratic method
because in this way every man
and woman can contribute in
accordance with their respective
means. I feel sure that Arizona
will do her share in promoting
this good work."

STOMACH TROUBLE
Nir. Marion Holcomb. of Nancy, Ky., says: "For quite
a long while I suffered with stomach trouble. I would
have pains and a heavy feeling after my meals, a most
disagreeable taste in my mouth. If I ate anything with
butter, oil or grease, I would spit It up. I began to have
regular sick headache. I had used pills and tablets, but
after a course of these, I would be constipated. It just
seemed to tear my stomach all up. I found they were
no good at all for my trouble. I heard
THEBFORD'S
recommended very highly, so began to use it It cured
me. I keep it in the house all the time. It is the best
liver medicine made. I do not have sick headache or
stomach trouble any more." Black-Draught acts on
the jaded liver and helps it to do its important work of
throwing out waste materials and poisons from the sys
tem. This medicine should be in every household for
use in time of need. Get a package today. If you feel
