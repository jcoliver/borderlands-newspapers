cient service and courteous treatment,

endeavor to make this store

NEW PASSPORT REGULATION'S.
The following extracts from a
new passport orc3er issued May
9th by the Secretary of State
and received by Secretary Gil
Rankin of the Nogales Chamber
of Commerce, from the Chamber
of Commerce of the United
States, will be of much interest
to those who contemplate cross
ing the international boundary:
"With reference to Section 10
(a) and Section 11 (b) of the Ex
ecutive Order of- August 8, 191S.
it is hereby ordered thpt aliens')
border permit cards (L'orm V)
and United States citizens' iden
tity cards for use on the Mexican
border (Form I) may be granted
by Permit Agents on the Mex
ican border to neutral or cobel
ligerent aliens and American
citizens residing anywhere in the
continental United Staces for
passage across the border to
any place within the continental
United States, provided that
American citizens residing in
Mexico beyond the forty mile
border zone shall not be fur
nished with identity cards unless
they have been registered in the
American consulates within the
jurisdiction of which they reside.
"Alien border permit cards
and United States citizens' iden
tity cards shall be valid for any
number of crossing within six
months from the date of issu
ance, and noo more thun one
consular visa or verification shall
be required for each card.
"An alien carrying a passport
and identity card shall have the
latter visaed and an appropriate
notation should be placed upon
the former. It is not necessary
to have both passport and per
mit visaed.
"Mexican citizens shall not be
required to produce passports as
a basis for the issuance of aliens'
border permit cards if they can
otherwiseX establish their iden
tity and nationality to the satis
faction of the uermit agent.
"The above mentioned iden
tity cards and permits may be
issued upon oral applications in
the discretion of permit agents.
"Applicants shall not be required-to
show that their trips
are necessary.
"The foregoing provisions
have no application whatsoever
to hostile aliens.
"The provision in the first
paragraph hereof, under which
American citizens going into the
interior of Mexico may be per
mitted to cross the border with
identity cards, is intended for
emergency cases in which ap
plicants would be seriously in
convenienced by being obliged
to apply for and await the issu
ance of regular passports. How
ever, American citizens intend
ing to visit the interior of Mex
ico, should for purposes of iden
tification and protection provide
themselves with regular pass
ports if possible. Those who
obtain identity cards in lieu of
passports should apply to the
nearest United States consular
representative for information
and advice upon conditions in
the particular localities which
they contemplate visiting, in
order to ascertain whether such
visit may be made with reason
able safety.
"This order supersedes all pre
vious orders and instructions in
conflict herewith."
THE STRAIGHT OF IT.
The Oasis is informed on very
good authority that the straight
story with regard to the report
ed change in policy in Sonora
on wines anl liquors, is this:
There is pending now in the
state congress an enactment
which will probably be adopted
and receive executive approval,
which will permit sale in limited
number of establishments of
light wines, champagne and beer.
In Nogales, Sonora, there will
be five such establishments.
Each establishment will pay a
high license, and an additional
on every bottle of wine, cham
pagne or beer. No ardent or
spirituous liquors will be permit
ted to be sold.
It is stated that all the places
so licensed will be under the
strictest surveillance, maintain
ing the most perfect order, and
permitting no infraction of the
law. Oasis.

Vocational Training Endorsed.
Recently the Board of Direct
ors of the Nogales Chamber of
Commerce were addressed by
I'rof. Butler of the University of
Arizona upon the subject of
vocational training, and at that
time resolutions of endorsement
were adopted. Copies of the re
solutions were transmitted by
Secretary Rankin to the Super
intendent of Schools in Nogales,
Arizona, to the Board of Super
visors and to the County School
Superintendent.
Following is a copy of the re
solutions adopted:
RESOLUTIONS
Whereas many children leave
school at the age of fourteen
who are in need of trade train
ing: and Whereas many of these
children enter "blind alley" jobs
wherein thev cannot learn a
t.rnflp- find this hnnhazlrd em- I
ployment results in much idle
ness, to the moral and financial
detriment of the child and of the
community; and
Whereas trained persons are
greatly needed in industry, due
partly to the disappearance of
the old-time apprenticeship sys
tem: and
Whereas this need has been
lecognized by the United StatesN
Government, which thru Con
gress has appropriated money to
assist communities to provide
vocational education in the pub
lic schools;
It Is Hereby Resolved that
the Nogales Chamber of Com
merce, thru its Board of Direct
or, in regular meeting assem
bled May 22, 1919, endorses
vocational training in the public
schools and recommends to the
Board of Supervisors, Board of
School Trustees antV-to the Sup
erintendent of Schools of Santa
Cruz county :
That practical vocational train
ing be instituted in the" regular
day, part-time, and evening
school in co operation with Fed
eral and State authorities who
are authorized to provide for a
large proportion of the cost of
such -education.
