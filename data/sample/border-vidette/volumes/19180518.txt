Captain Burton C. Mosstnan,
who used to be captain of the
Arizona rangers, was in Tucson
during the week from his cattle
ranch at Roswell, N. M. Capt.
Mossman has prospered since he
used to live in Arizona and is
now one of the richest cattlemen
in the Southwest. He bought
the West Coast steers and is
shipping 2500 of them from Tuc
son today.
Wade Johnson, a young cat
tleman of Midland, Texas, has
been spending several days in
Benson and vicinity, looking
around with a view of locating.
He says the droughty conditions
in his home locality have almost
put the cattlemen out of busi
ness. Like many others from
that state, he is looking toward
Arizona as the best and most
promising field in which to save
his cattle and recoup his losses
of the past two years. Benson
Signal.
Supervisor George W. Parker
and brother, Duke, have leased
the Arthur ranch of 320 acres
for additional pasture. The
Parkers recently sunk two wells
on the forest reserve, but did
not succeed in striking sufficient
water for their many cattle. The
Arthur place has a good well,
and is on the edge of the moun
tains, so the cattle ranging in
the bills will not have so far to
go in future to secure an abun
dance of water. Santa Cruz Pa
tagonian. We are praying for rain. This
is the dryest spring we have
had in many years and farmers
that were foresighted enough to
plant their crops early have had
the benefit of the winter's mois
ture in starting things growing.
If the ground has enough mois
ture to bring the plants out of
the ground, and frost doesn't
strike them too hard, they will
stand until the summer rains
come and make a good crop.
Frequent cultivation will con
serve the moisture still in the
ground. Don't forget this im
portant fact. Patagonian.
SECOND RED CROSS WAR FUND
The War Council of the Amer
ican Red Cross has issued the
following address to members of
that organization: "To carry
out the proclamation of the Pre
sident of the United States and
President of the Red Cross you
are called upon to spare no ef
fort to make Red Cross week
beginning May 20 a period of
patriotic generosity unsurpassed
in the annals of practical relief.
The minimum American contri
bution should be a $100,000,000.
"You are asked to review care
fully the needs of our own troops
and troops and civilian popula
tions of our allies as outlined in
the President's proclamation and
discussed in detail in many re
ports of this organization, and
then bring these needs to the
attention of all with whom you
come into contact.
"Let no Red Cross member
fail in the opportunity to give
until he feels he has a satisfac
tory personal share in these
measures for victory. Red Cross
week affords every American an
opportunity to give to his coun
try and his country's allies to
do his utmost without thought
of financial return that those
who are suffering may be sus
tained to victory.
"Let no one be able to say
that he did not give or that he
did not give sufficiently because
he failed to understand the
needs, no matter how many men
are in camp or in transit or in
trenches protection of the Red
Cross must be with every one
from the time he leaves home
until he returns, or until he finds
his grave on foreign soil. The
same protection must be main
tained over any dependents he
may leave behind.
"Rapid increase in the num
ber of our soldiers in France
means that lied Cross facilities
abroad for immediate relief and
care of our fighters must be in
creased. Refugees driven from
their homes by Germans have
added thousands to the number
of homeless old men, women and
children in France and Italy
who must be fed, clothed and
nursed back to health and re
established. The death of every
allied soldier makes this more
important to every civilian and
especially every child.
"The fight to overcome tuber
culosis in France must be main
tained and increased. The cam
paign to save babies and chil
dren the immediate hope of
future citizenship must be ex
tended. The need for at least a
hundred millioa dollars is con
vincing and immediate.
"The Red Cross in more than
a hundred ways is rendering
service here and abroad that
saves human life and maintains
the fighting spirit of our allies.
The Red Cross must always be
financially prepared to deal with
unexpected emergencies con
stantly arising from war condi
tions. In these emergencies im
mediate relief is the only effec
tive relief. Never has money
been made that yields such big
returns in allaying pain, restor
ing happiness and creating use
fullness for our fellow human
beings as the Red Cross dollar
of the first War Fund."
THE PATAGONIA DISTRICT.
Probably the most marked de
monstration of revival in a sil
ver copper district in the state
is that of which Patagonia has
recently given evidence. Idle
ness which hung over the dis
trict for several years, broken
by an occasional but short lived
turn toward the resumption of
activities, has now been perma
nently shaken off under the
stimulus of higher silver price
and promised higher price of
copper. Machinery is arriving
for a new mill to be erected at
the old Flux mine, additional
equipment is going to the old
World's Fair and a number of
other properties are receiving
preparation for larger activities
than before known. The World
Fair at this time is centering
the largest attention. Its con
trol has been sold by Frank
Powers to strong eastern inter
ests which now have represent
atives at the property preparing
plans for the extensive equip
ment and development which is
needed in order that the max
imum returns may be bad from
the mine of which it is conceded
to be capable.
Intermittent production of the
property since its discovery in
1893, has been attended by out
put of ore from which more
than $1,000,000 has been return
ed. Of this amount probably
half was from a comparatively
small tonnage of high grade.
The possibilities of the mine
have not been sounded and
under its new control it is en
tirely within range that it will
develop one of the great silver
properties of the country with
side values of no mean kind in
gold and copper. Powers so be
lieves. He has never had doubt
as to what a proper investment
of capital in opening up and
equipping the property would
do, but he never cared to under
take the big task himself.
Turn of tide in the affairs of
the World's Fair and other prop
erties in the district which is
now well under way, may be ex
pected to bring Patagonia to
prominence as one of the big
camps of the country. Star.
SPRING ROUNDUPS.
Cattle roundups in Southern
Pima county began Tuesday.
The Arivaca Land & Cattle Co.,
was the first to start. The La
Osa Livestock & Loan Company
roundup commenced Wednesday
and the Las Jarillas Cattle Com
pany started Thursday.
County Rangers Burts and
Thornberry will be on the job
till the roundup is over.
Sid Simpson is in charge of
the La Osa roundup. George D.
Elliott, manager is there keep
ing tab on things.
The Papago Indians are
through rounding up in the flat
country and are now working in
the Babacomari mountains.
The roundups are also 'n full

ties. Arizona Cattleman.
REGISTRATION FOR PRIMARIES.
Qualified Electors Must Register Be
fore Voting This Year.
The Election Laws of Arizona
provide for a complete registra
tion of all electors in the state
every two years on the even
years. In compliance with the
requirements of this law regis
tration for the November elec
tion began at the office of the
County Recorder and the office
of Town Clerk Smith, deputy
registering officer, on the first
Monday of May, and will con
tinue until ten days before the
County Primary Election, or un
til August 31st, at 5 o'clock p.
m., at which time the books will
be closed for seventeen days,
and no registrations will be made
until September 18th, when the
books will again be open and
registering continue until Octo
ber loth, when the books will be
closed until the first Monday in
May, 1920.
The qualifications of electors
are as follows: Must be twenty
one years of age or over; a citi
zen of the United States, either
by birth or naturalization; re
sident of Arizona for one year
prior to election, and of the
County and Precinct for thirty
days; must be able to read the
Constitution of the United States
in the English language and
write his or her name, unless
physically unable to do so.
If elector is a naturalized citi
zen he must present his second
or final papers to t-he registra
tion officer, else he cannot be
registered. If, however, such
papers are lost or destroyed, the
elector will be permitted to re
gister, upon executing and filing
with the registering officer, an
affidavit giving the time, place
and court of issuance of such
papers, and the fact of their loss
or destruction and circumstances
connected therewith.
The above applies to women
as well as to men, except that
women of foreign birth become
naturalized citizens upon their
marriage to citizens of the Unit
ed States either by birth or na
turaliza tion, or if already mar
ried, the naturalization of the
husband carries with it citizen
ship of the wife. On the other
hand when a woman who is a
citizen of the United States,
either by birth or naturalization,
marries an alien, her citizenship
ceases with such marriage. In
short, the citizenship of the wife
is that of the husband.
Electors must register in the
precinct in which they reside in
order to enable them to vote at
any primary or general election.
The law hy which a person, if
not on the register, could regis
ter at the polls, has been omit
ted from the code now in force,
and in order to vote at any pri
mary or general election, the
elector's name must appear on
the register of the precinct
wherein he or she resides. If,
after registration, the elector
moves to another precinct or
county, he or she must cancel
such first registration and then
register again in the precinct or
county where the elector re
sides. A person must not re
gister more than once witnont
first cancelling any prior regis
tration. To fraudulently regis
ter more than once, or to know
ingly register in any precinct
where the elector is not a re
sident at the time of registering,
is a criminal offense and subjects
the offender to a fine in a sum
not to exceed two thousand dol
lars, or imprisonment not to ex
ceed three years, or both. Every
body must register this year if
they wish to vote at the primary
election on September 10th, or
at the general election on No
vember 5th, or at any other elec
tion which may be held within
the next two years. No regis
tration of former years will suf
fice. An amendment to the regis
tration laws mide four years
ago, provides that the elector
when registering must give his
party affiliation, or say that he
has none, if such is the case.
According to the decision of the
Attorney General, any elector
refusing to give his party affilia
tion cannot register. If he has
no party affiliation he may so
state, but in order to register,
this question in the registration
blank must be answered. The
question of registering without
giving party affiliation does not
affect the elector at the general
election, but it is an important
factor in the primary election,
for selection of candidates for
the general election, for, unless
a party affiliation is given, the
elector will not be permitted to
vote for any of the candidates
on the regular primary ballots.
Registration officers should re
member that the law requires
that every elector be sworn be
fore registering.
RED CROSS WEEK.
President Wilson has desig
nated the week of May 20th to
27th, as "Red Cross Week," dur
ing which the public will be ap
pealed to for another hundred
million dollar contribution.
Shortly after America's en
trance into the world conflict the
American Red Cross, through
its War Council appointed by
the president, asked of the Am
erican people one hundred mil
lion dollars, as their first con
tribution to the War Fund. That
War Fund had been decided up
on as necessary to carry through
the broad plans of European
and American war relief on the
scale that their need justified.
The money contributed at that
time will have been all expend
ed by early this summer and the
accounting of this expenditure,
audited by the government, has
been given the widest publicity.
The people of Santa Cruz
county are urged to contribute
to their full ability to the Red
Cross War Fund during the big
drive that will start next Mon
day, May 20th.
Our quota this time is only
$4,000. Watch us go over the
top.

POLITICAL ANNOUNCEMENTS.
DEMOCRATIC TICKET.
Election, Monday, May 27, 1918.
For Council :
Jambs A. Harrison,
George H. Fiedler,
Wirt G. Bowman,
Gkoroio W. Dunbar,
R. E. Butler,
W. II. Smith,
T. M. Ford, Jr.
City Clerk Will Smith will
make a valuable member of the
Democratic town council. Dur
ingr the past six years Will has
made a splendid record as col
lector for the city water depart
ment and town cle k. He is
capable, industrious and honest.
He is independent of all special
interests, and can be depended
upon to give his time and ex
perienoe to Nogales, without
money and without price. In
persuading Will Smith to permit
his name to be placed on the
Democratic municipal ticket, De
mocratic voters made no mis
take. With his name on the
ticket, it will not be a bit "hard
take."
When the town council, to be
elected May 27th, is called or
der, and R. E. Butler, cashier of
the Nogales National Bank; Will
Smith, town clerk; Geo. Dunbar,
the successful real estate man,
and T. M. Ford, efficient man
ager of the J. D. Halstead Lum
ber Company, answer "present,"
and George Fiedler, James Har
rison and Wirt Bowman, three
veterans in public service, also
occupy seats at the council table,
Nogales will be represented by
seven men thoroughly qualified
to administer the affairs of our
wonderful little city. All are
Democrats of the old school, who
believe in "Equal rights to all;
special privileges to none."
James A. Harrison, chair
man of the board of supervisors,
and member of the town council,
needs no introduction to Nogales
voters. Everybody knows and
likes Jim Harrison. He has made
an enviable record in everything
he has undertaken, from punch
ing cattle to cutting coupons.
As one of the city and county's
heaviest taxpayers, Senator Har
rison, can be depended upon to
carefully guard taxpayers' in
terests, in the future as he has
in the past. There is no reason
why every Democrat who goes
to the polls one week from next
Monday, should not vote for Jim
Harrison and his six running
mates on the Democratic ticket.
George H. Fiedler, who for
nearly fifteen years has been
the efficient roundhouse foreman
for the Southern Pacific com
pany, at this place, has had
valuable experience as a mem
ber of the town council and as
chairman of the board of super
visors. As a member of the De
mocratic town council to be elec
ted May 27th, George will be of
invaluable service to Nogales,
to which he has already given
six years of his time, free. When
the votes are counted on the
evening of May 27th, George
Fiedler will be found running
with the bunch of winners, for
Nogales needs men like George,
and will not overlook this oppor
tunity to use him.
Wirt G. Bowman, candidate
on the Democratic municipal
ticket, for town councilman, for
more than a quarterof a century
has been identified with No
gales, as agent and assistant su
perintendent of the Southern
Pacific of Mexico, and as a sue
cessful progressive business
man. He is a big taxpayer and
understands the town's needs.
He is identified with no "special
interest," and wears no man's
collar. As a member of the town
council, Wirt Bowman will al
ways be found carefully guard
ing the best interests of all of
Nogales. His great personal in
terest in the town's present and
future welfare, makes him a safe
man on the town council.
George W. Dunbar, the suc
cessful real estate man, since
coming to Nogales several years
ago, has done a great deal for
the betterment and upbuilding
of our growiug little city. He
and' his company have built
many handsome, substantial re
sidences and added largely to
the taxroll. George is a wide
awake business man who be
lieves in doing business on the
square, at all times. "Live and
let live," has always been his
motto. As a member of the
town council, he will at all times
be found working for a bigger,
belter Nogales.

Monday Wirt G. Bowman mo
tored to Tucson, on federal court
business. He made the run from
the old pueblo to Nogales, in
two hours and ten minutes. Re
ports the road in excellent con
dition. Monday night Joe Polin, re
turned from Guaymas, where he
had been on business connected
with a shipment of manganese
ore, consigned to the states from
Lower California. Manganese
is a product greatly desired by
the United States government at
this time, and. brings a nice
price.
Thanks to the patriotic citi
zens of Pata,gonia and surround
ing country, including Nogales,
which was weli re p resented, the
dance given last Saturday night
at the Patagonia opera house
under the auspices of the Red
Cross ladies, was a great suc
cess, financially and socially.
Everybody who attended from
Nogales reports having had a
fine time. The principal ad
dresses made were by Dr. A. Li.
Gustetter and Rev. George C.
Golden of Nogales, and E. H.
Evans of Patagonia.
Hon. A. C. Bernard, of Tuc
son, after a couple of days spent
here on business and pleasure,
returned home Thursday after
noon. Mr. Bernard was met
here by bis sou, Allen C. Ber
nard, Jr., who came up from the
United Sugar Company's great
plantation at Los Mochis, Sin
aloa, to see his father, before go
ing to Porto Rico, to accept the
responsible position of assistant
manager of the South Porto
Rico Sugar Company. Mr. Ber
nard, who is a member of the
Tucson Common Council, has a
host of friends here and in Son
ora, who are always glad to see
him.
Jimmie Ritchi, superintendent
of the Arizona European Mining
Company, the principal owners
of which reside in Nogales, was
a business visitor at the county
seat last Monday, from the
camp, near the famous Three R
mine, this county, fourteen miles
from Nogales. Supt. Ritchi
reports an important discov
ery of copper silver gold ore in
the Roberto claim owned by the
company, which gives great pro
mise. Officers and stockholders
of the company are greatly
pleased with the good work being
done under Mr. Ritchi's able
personal supervision. Regular
shipments of ore are being made
to the smelter at El Paso, from
Bloxton station.
Mr. and Mrs. Robert E. Lee,
who were quietly married here
on May 8th, are enjoying their
honeymoon in sunny California.
Before returning to Nogales,
Mr. and Mrs. Lee, nee Miss
Anna Louise Ohlbach, will visit
the lady's mother and other re
latives in Denver, Colorado.
They will make their home at
206 Crawford street, Nogales,
Arizona.
Last Monday about one o'clock,
fire destroyed the major portion
of the roof on the east half of
the Nogales Public School, and
water damaged much of the
plaster in the big building. Tha
loss is estimated at about five
thousand dollars, covered by in
surance. An overheated chim
ney was the cause of the blaze.
Within a very few minutes after
the alarm was sounded, Chief
Bracey Curtis and his splendid
fire fighters, were on the scene
and by prompt work, soon had
the flames under control, thereby
preventing the total destruction
of Nogales' fine big public school
building. The work of the vol
unteer fire fighters, would have
done credit to professional fire
lighters in a large city.

"SOMEWHERE IN FRANCE."
Father Van Goethem Writes Inter
esting Letter to Nogales Friend.
R. L. O'Neill today received a
letter from Chaplain G. C. Van
Goethem who is seeing service
"somewhere in Prance" and the
letter is worthy of reproduction
for the benefit of Nogales peo
ple who are acquaiuted with
Father Goethem, who was locat
ed here prior to his enlistment,
says Monday evening's Herald.
"Today I mail you all the
copies of the official paper of
the A- E. P. in Prance, valuable
as a set, valuable for news, val
uable because it saves us writing
long letters. Make good use of
them for the benefit of the K. of
C. and D. of I., and the Nogales
Daily Herald. It is by far the
very best and newsiest paper of
the many we get out here local
ly, and I am sure you will all
appreciate it. Henceforth I will
mail you a copy weekly and
some "other stuff pulled off here"
in the journalistic line, dailies
excluded.
"Believe me, my heart is in
Nogales! I must not think of No
gales, the home of happiness
and peace, as compared with
Europe. But a la guerre, comme
a la guerre; I have no regrets,
on the contrary; I have no apol
ogies to make! I realize now, I
would not dare look a real man
in the face, had I not taken up
the burden and done my share.
Many things happen, and across
many things we run daily would
be interesting to you all, but the
knowledge of these is for future
reference. Uncle Sam is pru
dent and wise. And one thing
I can say, there is nothing but
will redound to the greater honor
of the world saving nation, the
grand U. S. We stand aghast,
you will in time, at the worth of
our dear Uncle to the world to
day and in the future; and we
wilL love Uncle 99 per cent more
after all this than ever we did.
I want to say this and repeat it,
in order that you and my fellows
of Nogales within the sphere of
your influence many know, cov
ertly, that we, you and they are
doing the greatest of works,
truly saving the world. And
noble heroic Prance is taking
hold of our heart more than
ever, for words cannot express
our admiration for this nation
and its people. Even our cousins
from across the channel are
drawing closer.
"You will likely read in the
eastern papers of the opening of
a K. of C. hut where I am now
stationed, the greatest of events,
and of the best augury. I can
not write about it to you, though
it will be from my pen in the
papers, because it must go
through headquarters.
"Lieut. Ed. Titcomb, is within
three miles from here; I will
visit him tomorrow.
"Heartiest greetings to all;
keep the ball a-rolling for God
and Country.
"Fraternally,
"G. C. Van Goethem."

Dizzy
Spells
Mrs. G. P.Cartwright, of
Whitwell, Tenn., writes:
"I suffered with bearing
down pains. : . The
dizzy spells got so bad
that when I would start to
walk, I would just pretty
nearly fall. Was very
much run-down. I told
my husband I thought
Cardui would help me. . .
He got me a bottle. . . It
helped me so much that
he got me another bottle.
I got a whole lot. better.
The dizzy spells and the
bearing-down pains ...
left me entirely."

run-down, or suffer from

You can feel safe in giv

as being of great value in
the troubles from which
only women suffer. The
enthusiastic praise of the
thousands of women who
have been helped by
Cardui in its past 40 years
of successful use should
assure you of its genuine
merit, and convince you
that it would be worth
your while to try this
medicine for your trou
