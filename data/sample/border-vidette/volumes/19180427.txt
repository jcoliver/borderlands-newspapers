Hog raisers should plant plen
ty of peanuts. If labor is scarce
at harvest time, the hogs can do
the harvesting. If labor is
plentiful harvest the peanuts
and feed the hogs the peanut
meal. The hay is good for all
livestock.
The United States govern
ment is now testing the long
staple cotton grown in the Salt
River valley for airplane wings,
and as it has proven to be the
best that can be obtained for
auto tires there is no doubt that
it will stand the test for the
wings.
William Jennings Bryan, the
great commoner, will speak at
the Chautauqua at Miami, May
10. His addresses this year have
done much to arouse the public
to necessity of waging a sue
cessful war. He is in perfect
harmony with the president, so
are all loyal citizens, irrespec
tive of past party belief.
Before this war is over old
clothes, old fashioned hats and
plain habits of living will be
badges of honor. There is much
more patriotism in wearing a
calico dress or a pair of overalls
than there is in keeping up with
the fashions. .You can buy lux
uies with Liberty Bonds after
the war is over. Thrift stamps
will then be good pin money.
The purchase of over one
thousand cars of beans by the
U. S. government should be of
interest to the farmers of this
part of the country, as the pink
bean is a staple product of Ari
zona. There is promise that
the 1918 bean crop will be much
larger in Arizona than at any
previous year, and the producer
can rest assured that he will
find a ready market for his crop.

there is an immense body of ore

The export of copper metal
for eleven months of 1917 total
ed 1,036,823,480 pounds as
against 784,103,644 pounds for
the entire year of 1916. These
figures show an increase of 252,
716,736 pounds for the eleven
months or 22,974,240 pounds
each month. It was semi offi
cially announced that the De
cember exports approximated
83,000,000 pounds. This addi
tional amount raised the total
exports for 1917 to 1,119,820,480
pounds. This amount is by far
greater than has been exported
to date. The previous record
exports were made in 1913, at
which time about 25 per cent
less copper was exported.

The court notified the defend

ENLIST IN NAVAL RESERVES
The United States Naval Re
serve Force is making a drive
for men for service in all parts
of the world. As everyone well
knows, the U. S. Navy is the
best fed, best clothed, best treat
ed and most democratic Navy in
the world. The Naval Reserve
Force is an actual part of the
U. S. Navy created for service
in time of war. Men are given
every possible opportunity for
advancement; those who show
good promise are sent to the
Officers' Training Schools in dif
ferent parts of the United States
for instruction and training.
Men to be eligible must be be
tween the ages of 18 and 35;
must be native born citizens of
the United States or have their
final naturalization papers; must
show a clean bill of health; and,
if within the draft ages, must
have a statement from their Lo
cal Boards showing they are not
in the current quota.
Practically all Departments
are open for enrollment. Men
with trades are accepted in their
trades; men without trades are
enrolled for deck, engine and
tire room duties, and for special
duties. Recruits are subject to
call for active duty for full naval
service when actually needed; in
time of peace they may resign
or continue in the Naval Reserve
Force. The pay of first enlist
ment ranges from $35.90 to $83. 00
per month, depending upon the
man's qualifications, in addition
to outfit of clothing, board and
lodging, and free medical atten
tion. There is a Naval Reserve En

special session called.
Arizona Lawmakers Summoned to
Meet at Phoenix May 21.
On April 18th Governor George
W. P. Hunt, issued a call for a
special session of the Arizona
legislature to meet May 21, 1918,
as follows:
In order that the State of Ari
zona may render assistance in
the fullest extent possible to the
national government in the pre
sent crisis, and in order that
nothing that can be done may
be left undone in standing back
of our men on the firing line, I,
George W. P. Hunt, Governor
of the State of Arizona, by virtue
of the power and authority in
me vested by the Constitution,
do hereby convene the State Le
gislature in special session at
Phoenix, the capital of Arizona,
at 10 o'clock on the morning of
Tuesday, May 21, A. D., 1918,
for the purpose of giving con
sideration to legislation upon
the subjects enumerated below:
1. To extend the franchise to
electors of the State of Arizona
in the military and naval estab
lishments of the United States,
wherever they may be stationed.
2. To extend protection to the
civil rights of Arizonans in the
military and naval establish
ments of the United States dur
ing the period of the present
war; to protect the civil rights
of the famines and dependents
of Arizonans engaged in the pre
sent war, and to otherwise pro
vide for these families and de
pendents so they may not suffer
want or privation by reason of
the participation of any member
of their household in the present
struggle for liberty.
3. To provide that officers and
enlisted men of the National
Guard who are drafted into the
service of the United States
shall be allowed credit under the
laws of this State for such ser
vice as continuous service in the
National Guard of Arizona, dur
ing the time such officers and
men continue in service in the
National Guard of the United
States.
4. To legalize the Arizona
Council of Defense; to clothe it
with authority to meet emergen
cies in the present crisis and to
provide the necessary funds for
its maintenance.
5. To permit the investment
of the funds of the State of Lib
erty Loan Bonds of the United
States Government, and to fur
ther permit the investment of
the funds of the State, savings
banks, insurance companies and
trustees of trust funds in Farm
Loan Bonds, issued under the
Federal Farm Loan Act.
6. To encourage and to put a
premium on the Americanization
of all aliens within the State.
7. To provide such dairy le
gislation as is necessary to pre
serve and increase that industry
to meet the necessities of the
war.
There are a few other matters
not strictly of a war nature but
of such general and timely ap
peal that I am convinced the
Legislature would not wish them
overlooked :
1. The ratification of the Pro
hibition Amendment to the Fed
eral Constitution.
2. The ratification of the Wo
man's Suffrage Amendment to
the Federal Constitution, if am
endment as submitted by the
Congress of the United States
before adjournment of the Le
gislatu re.
3. To reimburse Honorable
Thomas E. Campbell for his ser
vices as de facto Governor of
the State of Arizona during the
period January 27, 1917, to De
cember 22, 1917.
4. To exempt from inherit
ance tax and from the lien of
any inheritance tax which may
have been created or attached
since the first day of November,
A. D., 1916, all observatories
and appurtenances which are
now, or which may hereafter be,
established and maintained for
astronomical research solely at
private expense and without
profit, together with any and all
property and funds which may
be provided for the maintenance
of such observatories. Such a
measure is clearly within the
provisions of our Constitution, 1
and would enable the State to
pay a fitting tribute to the -memory
of its greatest scientist,
the late Doctor Percival Lowell.
In witness whereof, I have
hereunto set my hand and caus
ed the Great Seal of the State
of Arizona to be affixed.
Done at Phoenix, the capital,
this 18th day of April, A. D.t
1918.

(Seal) Governor of Arizona.

COMING HOME.
Thousands upon thousands of
people in America today are
having the terrors of war brought
right into their homes. The
averge American has taken a
placid attitude with reference to
the war in Europe, mainly be
cause the activities are beyond
the sea.
Today, the great conflict is
being brought home, it is com
ing home every day, to the Am
erican people who have sons
and other relatives at the front.
Strong men, whose sons have
gone across the ocean to fight,
are realizing the terrible pros
pects. The people of America are be
ginning to Know this country is
at war. The people left at home
are beginning to realize what it
all means. It means that every
American must use his every
resource to aid the nation.
The United States government
is asking the people to subscribe
to a third Liberty Loan. The
duty of every American citizen
in plain. It is plainer now than
it has ever been. The campaign
started April 6. Help put Ari
zona over the top. Subscribe to
Liberty Loan Bonds and do your
duty. Tax yourself to the ut
most, and help the boys "over
there." They need food, cloth
ing, guns and ammunition. It
is up to you to supply these
things through the Liberty
Loan. Exchange.

News announcing the death,
at Los Angeles, of Frank Stoclc
er, was received here the lore
part of the week. Before going
to Los Angeles to engage in
business, Frank Stocker resided
at Guaymas, where he was in
the employ of the Southern Pa-ci-fic
of Mexico, many years. He
is pleasantly remembered by
many old timers in this section
and in Sonora. News of his un
timely passing will be learned
with regret by his friends. Death
came after an operation at the
California hospital.

Last Sunday Cyrus K. Bloome,
deputy livestock inspector, well
and favorably known in Santa
Cruz county, shot and killed
Charles Yakimovich, a rancher
resideing about seven miles from
Palo Alto, Pima county. Bloome
was given a preliminary hearing
at Tucson last Wednesday and
admitted to bail in the sum of
$5,000. His bondsmen are W.
Beckford Kibbey, Jr., the well

of ammunition small cartridges
a young Mexican was arrested
last Tuesday evening, by Spe
cial Agent Al Scharff, who is
ever on the alert for all sorts of
camouflage artists who make a
great mistake when they attempt
to pass Al by. The boy, who
was almost across the line when
called, immediately "squealed"
on his pals, and told the officers
where 250D more cartridges were
concealed on this side of the in
ternational line. He also gave
information that may lead to the
arrest of other members of a
well-organized gang of ammuni
tion smugglers.

HER FAMILY
BEDSIDE
Six Tears Ago, Thinking She Might Die, Says Texas Lady, But Nov
She Is a Well, Strong Woman and Praises Cardui For
Her Recovery.
Royse City, Tex. Mrs. Mary KI1
man, of this place, says; "After the
birth of my little girl... my side com
menced to hurt me. I had to go back
to bed. "Wo called the doctor. lie
treated me... but I got no better. I
got worse and worse until the misery
was unbearable. . .1 was in bed for
three months and suffered such agony
that I was just drawn up in a knot. . .
I told my husband if he would get
me a bottle of Cardui I would try it
I commenced taking it, however, that
evening I called my family about
me for I knew I could not last
many days unless I had a change for
the better. That was six years ago
and I am still here and am a well,
strong woman, and I owe my life to
Cardui. I had only taken half tha
bottle whGn I besan to feel better.
The misery in my side got less... I
continued right on taking the Cardui
until I had taken thiee bottles and I
did not used any more for I was well
and never felt better in my life... I
have never had any trouble from that
day to this."
Do you suffer from headache, back
ache, pains in sides, or other discom
forts, each month ? Or do you feel
weak, nervous and fagged-out? If bo,
give Cardui, the woman's tonic, a
trial. X 71
