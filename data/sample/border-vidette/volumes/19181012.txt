COURTESY.

The Spirit of Friendship.
This store looks upon its patrons not
merely as customers but as friends.
People purchase here becauso they
have friendly feeling for this store.
The cause which develops this friendly
feeling, may differ, in fact, they are
sure to differ. One's friendship for
the store is the result of finding good
values; another's is the result of effi
cient service and courteous treatment,
and so on.
Naturally this friendshiply feeling on
the part of our patrons is reciprocated
on our part. And this spirit of mutual
friendship is an impetus for greater
service and an incentive to ever-increasing
endeavor to make this store
a place where every visitor will feel
perfectly at home.

FRED T. COLTER IS ELIGIBLE MOTION PICTURES AT THE FAIR
George Babbitt Chairman and Thomas
Drennan Secretary of Committee.
At the recent meeting of the
Democratic Committee held at
Phoenix, Hon. George Babbitt of
Flagstaff, was elected chairman.
Thomas Drennan, secretary and
R. N. Fredericks, of Prescott
was elected treasurer.
Only one contest developed in
the meeting. That was between
Mrs. Inez Struckmeyer, wife of
F. E. Struckmeyer, and Thomas
Drennan, for secretary of the
committee.
The new chairman is a promi
nent merchant of Flagstaff. He
is a member of the State Ooun
cil of Defense. Thomas Dren
nen was the personal candidate
of Fred T. Colter, the Demo
cratic nominee for governor, and
Leroy Ladd, Colter's manager.
An important action by the
committee was the nomination
of James A. Kirby, of Clifton,
for tax commissioner, denying
the right of the republican in
cumbent, Kuchler, to hold over.
This matter now is in the courts
which have granted an injunc
tion in Kuchler's favor.
Attorney General Jones ruled
that Fred. T. Colter was eligible
to hold the office of governor if
elected.
The State administration and
its acts were given brief endorse
ments in the party platform. A
change was demanded in the
primary Jaws to secure voting
only by true partisans for each
ticket, this following charges
that many republicans this year
registered to vote in the demo
cratic primaries.
The Patagonia Commercial
Company has opened a store at i
Harshaw. The growing demand
for such an institution prompted ,
the move.
One feature of the coming
State Fair that Secretary Boyce
expects to attract more attention
than probably any other, is the
wonderful government exhibit
that is being sent to Arizona for
presentation at the fair. The
exhibit is being put out by the
United States Department of
Agriculture.
Part of the exhibit is compos
eu ox motion pictures, and one i
reel that will be interesting in
Arizona, particularly to the peo
pie from the heavily timbered I
sections, is that which shows
the devastation of millions of i
acres of feet of timber as the j
result of gross negligence on the
part of a camper. One fact that j
is forcibly brought home by this 1
picture, and that is not general- I
ly appreciated by the average j
person, is the close relationship
between the production of tim- j
ber, and the winning of the war.
A forest tire allowed to burn
may mean lewer airplanes to
fight the Hun. The prevention
of a fire may save the very trees
that Uncle Sam needs to build
the air lieet.
Forest fires, the great menace j
of the wooded regions of the ;
country, is the subject of one of
the pictures that will be pre j
sented by the government at the
fair. The pictures show how
very easy it is to start a fire, j
nuite unintentionally, by throw j
ing aside a burning match, then
the discovery of the fire simul ;
taneously by a forest ranger on
patrol and a forest guard at a j
lookout station on a mountain j
top. The story is completed by i
the heroic effort required to stop I
the llames, the provisions made
by the forest service for fighting
the lire, the rushing of men j
from near by towns and the final i
conquering of the conflagration,
I ut not until twenty houses are
destroyed in a town borderine
the burning forest.
The film is an actual picture
taken on the scene by govern
ment photographers during the
recent disastrous fire in the
Shasta National Forest in Cali
fornia, which resulted in the de
struction of the town of Sisson.
GIVE HAYDEN A SQUARE DEAL.
The cowardly scoundrels who,
afraid to come out into the clear
light of day in the vicious at
tacks they are making on Carl
Hayden's war record in con
gress, but are hiding behind
lying anonymous advertisements
will find that the spirit of fair
play which prevails in the citi
zenship of Arizona, will never
stand for such assassin like me
thods. Carl Hayden has loyalty
and patriotically stood with the
president and his party on every
measure designed to successful
ly prosecute the war, just as he
has faithfully stood by every
Arizonan who has ever jusly
claimed his aid in Washington,
regardless of the politics of that
claimant. The Tempe News, 1
proud to be classed among Mr.
Hayden's supporters, has no
quarrel with the republicans '
who are honestly advocating the
election of Mr. Hayden's oppo i
nent, who is also a clean and j
patriotic American. But, by the
eternal when a cowardly attack,
through distorting of facts and i
out and out lies, is made on as
cletin and conscientious a man
as Carl Hayden, it is time for all
decent people to raise a protest. I

Protection for All
Arizona Workmen
Is offered by the Workmen's Compensation Law, on the
ballot as Number 100 at the November election. Injured
workmen are only partially protected under the present
law, and it is essential that all classes be protected.
The Man Who Fights Amendment 100
Is a Profiteer in the Misfortunes of
His Fellow Working Men
Big Employers and their Employes united in the preparation
of the proposed law. It embodies the best features of all
laws in effect in the various states and has no "jokers." It
provides a higher schedule of payments than any other law
in existence. It eliminates personal injury litigation and
clears the court calendars. It is a money-saving proposition
for the taxpayer. Its benefits go direct to the injured per
son, and are not divided between the wcr! ?n, his attorney
and the necessary court costs. i

will attend the Liberty Loan
meeting Saturday night.
By your works you will be

If you don't attend the meet

Another Nogales Boy Makes Good.
Lieutenant Will C. King, of
Nogales, a son of Mrs. A. B.
Richmond, formerly of Nogales
now of Tucson, who has been in
France for some time, has lately
received from the French gov
ernment that much-prized mili
tary honor, the Croix de Guerre,
for exceeding great bravery at a
great altitude, while crossing
the Marne on July 16th and 18th.
Lieut. King has been transfer
red from the French to the Am
erican aviation corps, where he
and his pilot are to lead an Am
erican squadron.
Lieut. King, who was a Uni
versity of Arizona student, re
sided in Nogales when a boy,
and news that he is making
good, will be pleasant news to a
wide circle of friends of the
family in this section.
Mr. A. B. Richmond, the well

father.
