ARIZONA NOTES.
Items of Interest Culled From Our
Exchanges.
Twelve thousand acres of land
in the B:wie valley have been
purchased by California capit
alists and homeseekers who will
at once begin the work of con
verting the land into farms. The
land will be irrigated by pump
ing. Prosperity is rampant in the
Ray district, and at the bigin
ning of another year Ray busi
ness men are full of optimism
for the year in the history of the
camp. Everywhere are to' be
found the substantial evidences
of prosperity. The highest
wages in the history of the dis
trict are being paid, everybody
is busy and contented, and best
of all there is every prospect
that this state of affairs is going
to continue.
The old Slocum mine, thirteen
miles north of Glendale, hasJ
been taken over by the Jerome
Butte Copper Company, which
will begin operations almost at
one?. The company is planning
to lease a 150 ton smelter six
miles north of the Slocum for
the treatment of its ores from
that district. Eighteen claims
are included in the Slocum group
and show good values of gold,
silver and copper, the latter run
ning six per cent and $5.00 a ton
in gold.
Turkeys can be raised to better
advantage in Arizona than any
where in the United States. The
place most desirable for raising
them is on irrigated or dry farms
located close to the open range.
The only difficulty in such a
place would be danger from
coyotes, and the dreaded black
head disease which has played
havoc with the birds in other
places. In such a location the
turkeys will gather practically
all of their feed without expense
from the time they are a month
old until within one month of
Thanksgiving time, when they
should be fed liberally on con
centrated foods.
Interviews with Phoenix cat
tleman including L. Li. Harmon,
president of the Arizona Cattle
Growers' association. Chas.. Mul
len, former president of the Ari
zona Cattle Growers' association,
and Dwight B. Heard, president
of the Arizona National Live
stock association, indicated that
owing to the -great importance
of the subjects which will be
under discussion by the commit
tees of the American National,
and in the public meetings of the
association, at its annual conven
tion to te held in Cheyenne,
Wyoming, on the 18th, 19th and
20th of January, there will be a
large attendance of stockmen
from Arizona.
Native Crops of Rubber Are Best.
Plants native to Arizona
adopted to produce rubber, I will
name guayule as the first and
foremost. Different strains of
this plant have been isolated,
producing 8-29 per cent of rubber
in the dry i-hrub, and a yield of
20-25 tons cf dry shrub has been
demonstrate d in a fou r year crop.
The lowest price at which guay
ule rubber 1 as been sold is 27c,
so you see that the gross returns
per year figure pretty high. As
to expenses of cultivation, these
vary enormously, according to
conditions, but under favorable
conditions will put them as low
as $200 per acre per year. In
general, I will say that the guay
ule situation is very promising,
but as yet very few people have
any reliable information as to
methods of culture, it being held
as a trade secret by agencies
promoting the proposition.
Another Arizona plant that
produces rubber is the common
ocateilla, which is stated to con
tain as high as 25 per cent of
rubber.
There are various other native
plants of the aster tribe that con
tain small amounts of rubber and
I have heard that the stomachs
of slaughtered sheep are oc
casionally found to contain small
lumps of rubber, which they had
chewed out of the vegetation
upon which sheep had browsed.

sity of Arizona.
ARIZONA MINES BIG DiViDEND
PAYERS.
Ten mines in Arizona paid $34 -CC0,C00
in dividends daring the
past year. Adding Utah, Mon
tana, Nevada and Idaho divid
ends to those of Arizona we have
a total of over $100,000,000 in
dividends oaid out of the mines
of these five western States in a
single year.
These are some of the impres
sive facts brought out by the re
port Of the Geological Survey to
Secretary Lane just made.
"Never before," said Mr. Lane,
'has so large a draft been made
on the natural resources of our
country as during this year, and
never before have the metals
been extracted from these ores
with less waste or utilized to
better advantage in advancing
the general prosperity of the
country. Even as written in the
plain figures of 1916 production
the wonderful record of our
mines sets forth a degree of
national industrial independence
only hoped for a few years ago.
"Again copper stands out as
the best illustration of how Am
erican mines can meet a world
demand. The output of nearly 2
billion pounds of the red metal is
double that of ten years ago and
its value is twice that of copper
produced in 1915. Add to this
the facts that in value copper now
contends with iron for first place
among the metals and that to
gether the amount of these two
metals produced last year had a
value of more than one billion
dollars and we have a measure
of what this country can con
tribute in useful metals.
"The output of zinc from do
mestic ores increased last year
95,000 tons, which makes a re
cord for that metal, the total
value of spelter from United
States ore being 150 million dol
lars. Lead also shows a large
increase, the 75 million dollars
output being a gain of more than
50 percent.
"With all this activity in metal
production the coal mines have
had to meet a heavy demand, so
that the bituminous coal output
has now passed the half-billion
ton mark, an increase of 12 of
and one half per cent over the
previous year. Coke production
increased 30 per cent and it is
gratifying to note that by-product
coke made the largest gain,
which means a corresponding
gain in benzol and other valu
able by-products.
"Again the oil wells have given
a new record for petroleum yield,
the estimate of marked produc
tion of crude petroleum for 1916
being 292 million barrels more
than in 1915.
"Another mineral product
which furnishes an index of
business conditions is cement,
the 1916 production of which is
estimated to be 5 million barrels
in excess of the output of the
previous year, while the ship
ments were even greater, aggre
gating 94,500,000 barrels, with
the new year.
"The reports received from
the survey's western offices con
tain most significants mining re
cords, every western State
shows a large increase in yield of
metals, Arizona leading with a
gain of 100 million dollars over
last year, while Utah and mon
tana together report another 100
million dollar gain. Alaska also
had its best year, contributing a
total value of more than $50,000,
000 this year, or over 50 per
cent in excess of any provious
year.
"These advance statements
not only show that 1916 marks a
new advance for the mineral in
dustry of the country, but this
remarkable increase promises to
be approximately 25 per cent
over the 1915 production, so that
we may expect the final figures
to show a total of three billion
dollars."
An immense vein of vanadium
and tungsten ore has been dis
covered in the vicinity of the old
Ripsey mine, six miles south of
Ray Junction. The find was
made by L. W. Riggins, a pros
pector, who has gained the title
of "Lucky" Riggins on account
of his many important discove
ries in the mountains of old Pi
nal county.
THIRD LEGISLATURE.
No Join Session; No Governor's Mes
sage President and Speaker
Elected.
Phoenix, Jan. 8. The third
state, legislature of the State of
Arizonii met at noon today with
the air pregnant with apprehen
sion and uncertainty.
The situation was the most
dramatic which has ever con
fronted an Arizona body of law
makers. The state's executive depart
ment was in deadlock. Two gov
ernors claim the perogatives of
the office. The Senate and the
House were divided in their al
legiance. It had been found im
possible to effect a caucus until
a few moments before the con
stitutional hour for convening
the session. There was practi
cally no legislative program.
Nobody knew what might por
tend. At 11:30 both houses went in
to separate caucus. In the Sen
ate on the first ballot D. H.
Claridge for president had seven
votes and Mulford Winsor seven.
On the fourth ballot Claridge
had eight and Winsor six, and
the battle was over.
In the house the ballot dis
closed sixteen votes " for A. A.
Johns, of Prescott, and fifteen
for Loren F. Vaughn and the
battle was over.
When the clock above the dais
of either house ticked the stroke
of noon outward calm had suc
ceeded the storm which has been
raging since Saturday, and pro
ceedings went forward as re
gularly as the hands upon the
clocks.
True, the usual joint session
was conspicuous by its absence;
true there were no committees
to wait upon the governor and
inform him that the legislature
was organized and ready to re
ceive his communication, but in
every other respect it was much
as other legislatures have been.
Ex-Governor Hunt was in the
executive offices awaiting the
summons, should it come. Gov
ernor Tom Campbell established
temporary headquarters in the
corridors and was ready for
whatever might happen but
nothing did.
It was known early in the day
that there would be no decision
in the mandamus proceedings,
and that the status of the guver
natorial differences remained as
last week.
It was thus that the calm of
"high noon," followed the try
ing morning, and a sleepless
night.
RESEARCH BUREAU PROPOSED.
One of the most important
plans of the Arizona State
Bureau of Mines is to conduct a
legislative research bureau for
laws relating to mining, both
state and federal, in conjunction
with the department of legisla
tive research of the University
of Arizona.
Probably one of the greatest
burdens under which the mining
industry rests today is that of
confusing and ill advised laws..
This is particularly well illus
trated in our federal mining laws
which have been under fire now
for several years, and which
should be investigated by both
state and government bureaus
with a view to obtaining more
equitable legislation.
Another desirable point to be
considered in connection with a
legislative research bureau is the
securing of uniform mining le
gislation through the various
mining states of the west.
While it is not within the
province of the State Bureau of
Mines to recommend laws, it can
conduct researches on proposed
legislation for both the state
legislature and congress Pros
pector. A rate hearing will be held in
the federal court at Phoenix
Feb. 9 to decide wheter rail
roads are entitled to charge more
for passage from eastern points
to Arizona than they do from the
same point to points in the moun
tain states in the north. The
rates to Arizona are about the
same as those to California also.
The case is brought by the Ari
zona corporation commission.
UNIVERSITY OF ARIZONA AT
TRACTIVE FEATURES.
One of the most attractive
features of the University of
Arizona is the fact thai its stud
ents have so much out of door
life, out of door play and our-of-door
study. Probably at no
other institution in the United
States does so large a percentage
of the student body take part in
some kind of athletics. Very
few institutions can offer spring
football and winter baseball.
The growth cf the University
has been exceptionally rapid,
so much so that it is now a pro
blem to house the students. The
dormitories are overcrowded;
Arizona Hall, the newer of the
men's dormitories, has three
men to a room; South Hall, de
signed for one man to a room has
two, and there are three girls to
a room in their dormitory. This
condition could not be forseen
for who could tell that the atten
dance of the University would be
increased over thirty per cent in
two consecutive years. Had it
been able to foresee this, the
last legislative would undoubted
ly have taken care of it.
This is one of the disadvant
ages "of the biennial appropria
tion system.
Where as two years ago when
the legislature met, they were
full, and a year the University
there was ample room in the dor
mitories within seven months af
ter the adjournment of the legis
lature, they were full, and a year
later, overcrowded, to the extent
that many students have been
forced to take rooms off the cam
pus. Fortunately they are provid
ed with sleeping porches, which
makes it possible to crowd three
in a room. This, however, is
certainly not conducive to the
best environment for study.
There is no question, however
but what the rjext legislature
will provide for the housing of
the sons and daughters of the
tax payers of the state, who
desire to get an education.
In the addition of the publica
tion of bulletins, the State Bureau
of Mines has organized a press
service, arid weekly and bi weekly
press letters are sent to the pap
ers of the state, as well as seve
ral outside the state. The idea
of the service is to have a me
thod by which it is possible to
call to the attention of the people
of the state the many things
coming up in the mining indus
try that would be valuable for
them to know promptly, changes
in industrial conditions and many
other things that are happening
in this time of exciting interest
in the mining industry are of
vital importance for the mining
fraternity to know in order that
they may reap the benefits.
In addition to this there has
been maintained- by the Bureau
Arizona departments in the
Mining & Scientific Press and
Arizona Magazine, and it has
contributed liberally to the many
special newspaper editions dur
ing the year.
This is but one of the many
phases of the Bureau's work
which has possibility of consider
able enlargement.
Calles Adopts Americans Tactics.
Gen. P. Elias Calles is mak
ing a vigorous campaign for the
governorship of Sonora, more
after the fashion of the Amer
ican politician than any of his
contemporaries in Mexico, as far
as is known locally. He is mak
ing speeches in many of the
larger towns, while his workers
are visiting the smaller ones.
The general is at present in
Hermosillo a organizing cam
Daign committee, with C. G.
Soriano of that city as chair
man. From there he will go
to Sahuaripa via Ures, speak
ing at both places. He will
then return to Hermosillo for a
short time and then come to
Agua Prieta between the 12th
and 15th of the month.
He will make a speech-making
campaign through the Mocte
zuma district, "probably speak
ing at Moctezuma, Pilares, Cum
pas and other towns. Citizen. E. D. MILLER. Editor and Prop.

HUNT SUSTAINED.
Phoenix, Jan. 10. Called to
prether at the request of G. J.
Stoneman, state chairman of the
Democratic party, to disavow
acts of Governor Hunt which are
open to court construction as
illegal in connection with the
gubernatorial contest, the cen
tral executive committee today
sustained Hunt.
Stoneman offered the commit
tee a chance to pass a resolution
prepared by himself which de
clared for the support of Hunt
but shifted responsibility for the
possibly illegal acts of ':usurpa
tion of or intrusion into the
office of governor" to Hunt as an
individual, and not as leader of
the party's ticket.
The resolution was declined,
and in its stead was passed one
which "unqualifiedly endorses'
Hunt's stand."
Phoenix, Ariz., Jan. 10. The
executive committee of the State
Democratic Committee has re
pudiated the action of Chairman
Stoneman and Secretary Powers
in counseling against the Hunt
contest as not being the true
position of the Democratic party,
and announced at 1.-00 o'clock
today the fullest endorsement
and support for the Hunt contest
and undivided allegiance to Hunt
himself as the standard bearer
of Democracj'. Such resolution
passed by a vote of 26 to 8,
practically the full committee
being present. Chairman Stone
man will resign.
NOGALES INDIGNANT.
The Tucson Star of January
12th, says:
"The Star has received from
the Nogales chamber of com
merce, a statement contradicting
a story which appeared in Thurs
day morning's issue of this pap
er, quoting from a letter said to
have been written by J. G.
Crane, of Nogales, to James M.
Burke, assistant district attor
ney of Tulare county, California,
saying that there has been an
average of five deaths per day
among the Alabama national
guard stationed at Nogales.
"The story in question was
supplied by the Associated Press,
giving Crane as authority for
the statements.
"The telegram reseived from
the Nogales chamber of com
merce is as follows:
"Daily Star, Tucson, Ariz.
"Referring to your news item
dated Visalia. Cal.,"and headed
"Five Deaths a Day Amang Ala
bama Guard," official records
disclose a total of deaths from
all causes since July 1 up to
date of 25, among all troops sta
tioned here.
"Since December 1, and up to
and including today, there were
fifteen deaths, nine of pneumo
nia. "In the camps and in town in
the month of December there
were 20 deaths, nine soldiers and
11 civilians, mostly Mexicans.
"The December soldier popu
lation was about 6300 and the
town population 5300.
"There have been in the hos
pital here only 58 cases of pneu
monia. "Twenty-nine cases are now
under treatment.
"There has not been a case of
typhoid pneumonia.

of Commerce."
TOM HEADY AND WIFE LOST.
Evidence of the need for sign
ing the Ajo road properly from
end to end is shown by the ex
periences of Tom Heady, man
ager of the San Rafael ranch,
and his wife, who were lost on
the desert for three days last
week, wandered on foot into
Mexico and finally were rescued
by a Mexican when almost ex
hauted. Mr. Heady and his wife set
out for Ajo from Tucson by au
tomobile. They reached their
destination. On the return trip,
they encountered a fog, during
which they lost the road. Upon
attempting to drive through a
tank, or water hole, in the tracks
of a wagon which had preceded
them, the car was stalled so that
they could not pull out.
The Headys then continued
the journey on foot. They had
only a small lunch and a canteen
of water. Mr. T3eady carried a
rifle. For 48 hours they sought
human habitation or a sure road.

There is no way to tell whe

but admits now that the same

CONDITIONS IMPROVING.
Dr. Boido Says General Calles of So
nora. Is Man of Hour.
During the holidays, Dr. L.
Boido, of Phoenix and a former
Tucson resident, has been on an
extensive trip throughout the
State of Sonora and along the
border. He traveled in all parts
of the state of Sonora by auto
mobile and railroad, having gone
to Cananea, Agua Prieta, No
gales, Sonora, Magdalena, Her
mosillo, Guaymas, Empalmo, and
Navojoa. On this trip he noticed
a wonderful improvement of con
ditions in the past two months,
financially and from the effects
of the war, says the Tucson
Citizen.
In regard to finances, a month
and a half ago a decree came
from General Carranza doing
away with pap3r money and
adopting either American gold
or Mexican gold, as the legal
tender of the country. There is
more American gold in circula
tion among the poorer classes
than there is in the state of Ari
zona. There seems to be real
prosperity everywhere. Even
the bootblacks and the hack
drivers all have pockets full of
ready money, American money,
to make change to the customer.
While entering the market at
Guaymas on several occasions,
Dr. Boido handed fifty cent or
dollar uieces to children at the
counter, and they would imme
diately, and without hesitation,
make the correct change.
The doctor met quite a nura
ber or American mining men
throughout the different parts of
the state, who are prospecting
and denouncing mines in the
state of Sonora. Some travel
by automobile and others on
horseback. In respect to- the
recent decree made by General
Carranza, that no foreigners
could own mines unless they
should become Mexican citizens.
That is not so, having been the
version given this decree on this
side of the lin3 by the news
papers. The fact of the matter
is that an American citizen, in
oraer to denounce a mining
claim in Mexico, must ask per
mission from the proper author
ities, and then swear that he
will not ask his government's
protection for that particular
mine, in case of trouble.
The man of the hour in the
state of Sonora today and the
real . patriot who has done, more
towards instituting the proper
reforms in the state of Sonora,
is General P. Elias Calles. He
is an actual candidate for gov
ernor of the state of Sonora,
running in opposition to General
Jose Obregon, who is a brother
of Alvaro Obregon, the present
minister of war in Mexico City.
General P. Elias Calles was born
in Guaymas, Mexico, some 42
years ago, but he appears to be
no more than 35 years of age.
He is one of the best educated
men in the republic of Mexico.
He is a man whose standards
and judgement are of the best
that can be met in the republic
of Mexico. He is a natural born
leader, Jaeing liked by all his
men and his popularity is un
iversal throughout the northern
part of the state of SoDora.
General Obregon, his opponent,
is a man who is well thought of
and well liked in the southern
part of the state, in what is
known as the District of Alamos,
and since the inhabitants in the
northern part are more numer
ous than in the southern part, it
is generally conceded that Gen.
Calles will be the next constitu
tional governor. One of the real
reforms that General Calles has
implanted is decree No. 1, of
prohibition. "I have seen more
drunken men in Phoenix since
we had prohibition than I did
while in Sonora," said Dr. Boido.
"In fact, I failed to see one
drunken person in the whole
state of Sonora in the last two
weeks.
"There is no doubt but that on
General Calles' election theie
will be peace and prosperity
throughout the whole state dur
ing the term of his governor
ship, and there is no question
but what it will be the leading
state in the Mexican republic.
Everybody seems to be at work
in Sonora, tilling the soil and
looking after the cattle interests.
Living in Sonora under present
conditions, after having been
depleted by the terrible war for
the past - five years, is much
cheaper than in the state of
Arizona. Potatoes, 100 pounds
are worth one dollar. Coffee is
worth twelve cents a pound.
Twenty five pounds of sugar for
a dollar. Cori), one cent a
pound. Moat, eleven cents a
pound. Eggs twenty-five cents
per dozen, etc."
Another of the real reforms of
General Calles that will be im
planted later, wiil be a free zone
such as used to exist some years
ago along the border, where
merchants will be able to open
up their stores and import Eu
ropean and American goods
without duty. The re-establish
ment of this free zone will ha'e
a tendency to br ing a permanent
population bo Notjales, Sonora,
Naco, and Agua Prieta. Gener
al Calles has already started a
building boom in Agua Prieta,
which has already created great
enthusiasm.
About a month ago, through
the efforts of General Calles,
who was then commander-in-chief
of the military forces in
the state of Sonora, about 1500
wild Yaqui Indians, fully armed,
came down from the hills and
urreoderod themselves to his
forces. These Indians have
been quartered aloig the Yaqui
river. There is no more bush
whaekihg by the Indians around
the state of Sonora and no more
atrocities have bsen committed
since they have given them
selves up. People go from one
place to another with impunity,
knowing that there are no more
Indians on the warpath. While
the doctor was in Hermosillo,
there were 300 of these Yaqui
Indians with their women on a

"Next month the e'ection for
governor of Sonora will take
place, and with General Calles
at the head of the government,
there will be peace and prosper

Sonora, and let me say right now

is a man who will welcome all
nations to the reconstruction and

it Always Helps
says Mrs. Syl vania Woods, of Clifton Mills, Ky., in
writing of her experience with Cardui, the woman's
tonic. She says further: "Before I began to use
Cardui, my back and head would hurt so bad, I
thought the pain would kill me. I was hardly able
to do any of my housework. After taking three bottles
of Cardui, I beg?.n to feel like a new woman. I soon
gained 35 pounds, and now, I do all my housework,
as well as run a big water mill.
I wish every suffering woman would give
The Woman's Tonic
a trial. I still use Cardui when I feel a little bad,
and it always does me good."
Headache,, backache, side ache, nervousness,
tired, worn-out feelings, etc., are sure signs of woman
ly trouble. Signs that you need Cardui, the voman's
Ionic. You cannot make a mistake in trying Cardui
for your trouble. It has been helping weak, ailing
women for more than fifty years.
