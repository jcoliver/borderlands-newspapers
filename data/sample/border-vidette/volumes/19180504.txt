Ray Consolidated Copper Com
pany for the year ended Decem
ber 31, 1917, shows $615 earned
on stock ($10 par) against $7.42
in the previous year.
It was reported at Tucson that
an offer of $50,000 has been
made for the bond and lease of
the North Star mice, in the
Twin Buttes district. A hoist is
being erected on the property
and operations are beginning.
Pledging themselves to sup
port the food administration in
its effort to win the war, seventy-five
Cochise county grocers
met in Douglas and formed an
organization to help execute the
orders of the food administra
tion. The Crimson and Crepin strike
in the Papago district, near Tuc
son, is more spectacular than
ever in the development of high
grade lead and silver ore than
in the wulfinite at first encount
ered. Lead and silver running
as high as 111 ounces of silver
and 47 per cent lead was found
enciusted in several inches of
high grade wulfinite ore at a
depth of about eight feet.
The Oracle Liberty Loan com
mittee is still working at top
speed' and now is proud to re
port sales aggregating $11,000.
The quota allotted to Oracle is
468.00, so Oracle's flag will be
well dotted with stars. Cosider
ing that this has been the dullest
year Oracle has known in years
as to the number of people there,
it is all the more remarkable
that this small community of
fifty voters has raised such a
sum. l ne committee is still at
wcrk and hope for even more.
Carmel Combs of Jefferson,
Oklahoma, a youth but 10 years
old, was on the Kansas City mar
ket last week looking after a
shipment of five carloads of fed
steers of his own handling that
brought $13, a record price for
cattle from that part of the
country. These steers weighed
1,140 lbs. Young Combs owns a
spirited saddle horse and takes
a very active part in stock farm
ing. The cattle sold last week
had been under his personal care
all the time they were on feed
and were handled by him while
on sale.
There is hardly a newspaper
in Arizona which does uot ex
pend at least $50 every week in
giving government measures
free advertising and free write
ups. These constitute the news
paper stock of goods. Abso
lutely no other business gives
steadily and of its stock in this
manner. In addition to this, the
newspaper people subscribe lib
erally for bonds. This is not a
complaint, but a statement of
facts that people who expect
newspapers to give more than
they do should understand.
Prescott Courier.
The Castle Butte mine has
again been taken over on a bond
and lease, it is reported, by
Messrs. Miller and Scheerer,the
same gentlemen who have been
working the property, together
with Mr. C. P. Byron of Tucson.
Several carloads of ore have
been shipped from the Castle
Butte lately, and the lessees are
to begin work immediately de
veloping the property. The ad
dition of machinery will facili
tate the work of taking out the
ore, as the workings are too
deep for hoisting with a wind
lass. Patagonian.
News has been received in
Tucson of the promotion of a
soldier who was well known
along the Arizona Mexico border
during the Mexican troubles. It
has reference to the promotion
of Robert H. Noble to be a brig
adier general from a colonel.
Nobel was in command of the
Twenty-Second United States
infantry when it was camped at
Douglas. He was then a lieut
enant colonel and in the summer
of 1916 was made a full colonel.
Many local people will remem
ber with pleasure the soldier
and man Robert H. Noble, and
rejoice with him in his promotion.
To work, economize, and lend
money to the Government is the
duty of every American.
Hundreds of thousands of our
men have been called to arms
and taken away from the pro
ductive forces of the country.
Hundreds of thousands of
others have been diverted from
producing things used in peace
to producing things used in war.
In the face of this lessened
productive force and production
a great and unusual drain upon
our resources is made by our
army and navy and our allies.
Work and speed-up production
to make up for the lessened pro
duction; economize in consump
tion to lessen as much as possi
ble the drain upon our resources;
lend your money to your gov
ernment to prosecute this war
successfully.
YAVAPAI COURT HOUSE.
The Yavapai county new court
house is about the last word in
fine public buildings. Made of
native granite, quarried from
nearby mountain like deposits of
same, it is a home enterprise
to be proud of and one which
brings spontaneous admiiing
comments from all visitors. It
will, in all probability be a thing
of beauty a thousand years from
now, as it is almost as solid as
the pyramids of Egypt and a
blamed sight more useful, as the
Pyramids were built for the safe
keeping of mummies, the under
takers' trust of Egypt having
made the people believe that
when the body was destroyed
the spirit died a most horrible
death. Hence, large sums were
expended to make remains in
destructible and to safeguard
them in great stone tombs.
There will be no mummies in
the nee court house unless the
people vote them there, and as
we have a safe democratic ma
jority in this county, the rem
nants of the remains may be
kept out. Courier.
ONE HUNDRED PER CENT
The papers of the state are
taking a crack at every man in
their respective communities
who fail to check up to one hun
dred per cent Americanism.
While politics may enter into
the matter to some extent, we
feel that no matter what the
political complexion of the man
may be that his first duty is to
the government. Our govern
ment needs the support of every
man and every party and if you
are not 100 per cent you sure
are against us. It is the duty of
a newspaper to smoke out the
disloyal people and we hope
that the good work will be con
tinued. No half-hearted busi
ness should be countenanced
when it comes to lining up the
American Miner.
ATTENTION, VOTERS.
County Recorder A. E. Red
doch announces that the Great
Register of Santa Cruz county,
has been received, and commenc
ing May 6th, electors through
out the county, will have an
opportunity to register.
In a letter to the local press,
Recorder Reddoch said:
For the convenience of elec
tors of this county, will you
kindly publish the following in
formation: Par. 2883, Revised Statutes of
Arizona, 1913: "It shall be the
duty of every elector in the state
of Arizona, between the first
Monday in May and the 15th
day of October, 1914, and be
tween the same dates biennially
thereafter, to register with some
notary public or justice of the
peace, or with the county re
corder of the county in which
the elector resides, in accord
ance with this chapter."
In accordance with the pro
visions of this paragraph, regis
tration books will be open on the
first Monday in May (May 6th)
at the office of the county re
corder and at the office of W. H.
Smith at the City Hall.
Aucrs Reddoch,
County Recorder.
DOUBLE EFFECT OF ECONOMY
When an American citizen, in
stead of spending his dollars for
something he wants, denies him
self and lends the money to the
government by the purchase of
War Savings Stamps he per
forms a double service.
First, he furnishes the gov
ernment with money to use in
the prosecution of the war.
Second, he has relieved the
drain on our "goods and ser
vices;" that is, materials and
labor. To make the article or
articles he would have bought,
or to manufacture others to take
their place in the market, would
require materials and labor. In
addition, to get the article to
him labor and freight space
would be required. By doing
without the article, he has left
free a certain amount of mate
rial to be used for war purposes,
a certain amount of labor to be
used in the same way, and he
has also relieved to a certain ex
tent the transportation facilities
of the country.
This may not be much in the
individual case, but when hun
dreds of thousands and millions
of Americans pursue this course
it means millions and millions of
dollars loaned the government,
tremendous quantities of mate
rials left for use of the nation
in this war, millions of hours of
labor free to do war work, and a
vast amount of freight space
free for national uses.
These sacrifices are easy to
make; are small and trivial com
pared tc the sacrifices that our
soldiers and sailors make daily
while they offer constantly their
lives for their country, the
greatest sacrifice of all. Buy
War Savings Stamps!
SOME ASSESSMENT.
Cochise county still holds her
proud lead in assessed valuation
of all property, real and person
al, according to the returns made
by the state tax commission, her
total being slightly over 151
millions of dollars. Gila county
comes next with $142,000,000.
Maricopa county, including the
Great Salt River valley and the
capital city only shows a taxable
valuation of $80,000,000. Co
chise county shows an increase
of $1,132,418.40. Maricopa coun
ty shows slightly more increase
than Cochise. Gila county show
ed an increase of more than four
million, accounted for mostly in
the mine assessment. The as
sessment roll shows a continued
healthy growth of the state.
Review.
Will You Be Ready For Inspection.
The boys at the front now are
occupying trenches. Some are
in the first line trenches, dis
patches tell us.
You at home are in the back
line trench.
The fellows in the front line
trenches must stand inspection
regularly.
You in the back line trench,
too, must stand inspection. Will
you be ready ?
Remember, those brave lads
across the sea are depending
upon you to stand by them.
Everything they have came from
the fighters in the back line
trench the big trench right
here in America.
Perhaps you don't realize the
great responsibility resting with
you. It is just as great as that
shouldered by the brave fellows
across the sea.
Be a real soldier in the back
line trench, so you can stand in
pection. Be a good soldier in the home
trench Buy Liberty Bonds.
The war's success or failure,
so far as Uncle Sam is concern
ed, depends on what you do or
don't do.
Save food, help the Red Cross,
buy Liberty Bonds.
Just look yourself over. Take
an inventory of your bank ac
count. Gaze over your record
and see if you've done your duty
as a back trench soldier since
Uncle Sam entered the war.
If you can afford to buy Lib
erty Bonds, and don't, then you
are aiding the Kaiser.
Are you that kind of a back
trench fighter?
The Hardshell mine, at Har
shaw, is likely soon to be one of
the big producers of this dis
trict. The present manager, Mr.
H. K. Welsh, an expert mining
engineer, according to report, is
arranging for the work of re
timbering the old shaft so the
work of getting out ore will go
ahead while churn-drilling on
this immense property is going
on to locate other bodies of ore
believed to be there in quantity.
The churn drilling is a cheaper
method of prospecting than dig
ging, and the proper place to
sink a new shaft can be deter
mined bythis method.
Patagonia is to be congratu
lated on having the wealth of
the Daly estate back of the
Hardshell, and no expense will
be spared to prove up this big
and valuable property.
Col. R. R. Richardson, owner
of the property, worked it for
many years, but for some time
the property has been idle. Patagonian.

Catarrh Cannot Be Cured
With LOCAL APPLICATIONS, as they

Catarrh is a local disease, greatly in
fluenced by constitutional conditions,
and in order to cure it you must
take an internal remedy. Hall's Ca
tarrh Cure is taken internally and
acts thru the blood on the mucous sur
faces of the system. Hall's Catarrh
Cure was prescribed by one of the best
physicians in this country for years. It
Is composed of some of the best tonics
known, combined' with some of the

Alberto Mascarefias, ten year
old schoolboy, an American by
choice, has learned more about
the significance of America's
participation in the world war
and the obligations of those who
live under the American govern
ment, in two terms of schooling
in an American school, than
many German Americans have
in a lifetime spent in the United
States. Yes, he has leaned more
than some who were born in the
United States.
Alberto, at the request of his
teacher, wrote to his father,
himself a good American, by
choice, about the Liberty bonds.
The relation of the Liberty Loan
to the war and the flag to the
great conflict is told by Alberto
in the following words: (We re
frain from changing the spelling
of a single word lest we detract
something from this remarkable
letter:)
"Those people who do not do
their part in this war have no
right to live under our flag be
cause our flag stans for liberty
and that is what we ar fighting
for. That is why these bonds
ar called Liberty Bonds."
We defy Honorable Frank B.
Odell to state it more convinc
ingly. Incidentally the letter
speaks volumes concerning the
work which is being done in the
schools of Arizona. A fine pa
triotism is being inculcated in
the minds of the youths of the
state through the patriotic ef
forts of the school teachers. In
one Pima county rural school,
"service flags" are used to en
courage the use of English
rather than Spanish. Stars are
awarded to pupils for usiug En
glish as a means of communica
tion; for each day that the pupil
uses no Spanish he is awarded a
star. They are not forbidden to
use Spanish, but they are en
couraged to use English as a
means of becoming better citi
zens of the United States, of
better equipping them to assume
the obligations and privileges of
citizenship. Tucson Star.

WOMEN DOING THEIR PART.
The women of Arizona have
enlisted in the war with the
same fervent patriotism shown
by their brothers. The' are
oallinrrT.iharfir rv n H .2 nrrl Thi'ifh I
Stamps, are knitting in the Red
Cross and are preparing to fill
the -gaps that must be known
when the great Nation truly
swings into tho war. Mrs. Pau
line O'Neill of the State Wo
men's committee of the Arizona
Council of Defense at a late
meeting told how the girls are
getting xeady to take places in
the stores and in lighter employ
ments that will be vacxtod, tem
porarily or for the war, by the
stout lads who are needed al
ready on the farms or in the
workshops. It is appreciated
there are no munition factories
in the southwest and that the
best service that can be render
ed is to here increase the food
supply of the country, that Ari
zona be not only self supporting,
but produce a surplus for the
east or even for Europe. In the
Arizona border towns, the wo
men are providing dainties for
the men in the hospitals. A late
movement is the sending of flow
ers from the Salt River valley
towns to the military hospitals
at such points as Nogales, Doug
las and El Paso. Messenger.
Arizona Indians, for a score of
years quiet and peaceful, again
have taken up warfare but it is
for the enforcement of world
peace and not for rapine. They
have enlisted in large numbers
in the army and navy and are
making good and sturdy soldiers
and sailors. Many stalwart lads
from the Phoenix Indian Indus
trial school now are afloat, find
ing the life very attractive, ac
cording to their letters home. A
number of them have secured
added grade and pay through
detail to trades they learned at
the school. Possibly it may
seem strange to see an Apache
in a sailor's blue uniform, but it
merely shows that he has be
come an American and has pass
ed the tribal stage.

Mr. Marion Holcomb, of Nancy, Ky., says: "For quite
a long while I suffered with stomach trouble. I would
have pains and a heavy feeling after my meals, a most
disagreeable taste in my mouth. If I ate anything with
butter, oil or grease, I would spit it up. I began to have
regular sick headache. I had used pills and tablets, but
after a course of these, I would be constipated. It just
seemed to tear my stomach all up. I foimd they were
no good at all for my trouble. I heard
THEDFOKB'S
recommended very highly, so began to use it. It cured
me. I keep it in the house all the time. It is the best
liver medicine made. I do not have sick headache or
stomach trouble any more." Black-Draught acts on
the jaded liver and helps it to do its important work of
throwing out waste materials and poisons from the sys
tem. This medicine should be in every household for
use in time of need. Get a package today. If you feel
sluggish, take a dose tonight. You will feel fresh to
morrow. Price 25c a package. All druggists.
