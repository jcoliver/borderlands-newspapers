The Spirit of Friendship.
This store looks upon its patrons not
merely as customers but as friends.
People purchase here because they
have friendly feeling for this store.
The cause which develops this friendly
feeling, may differ, in fact, they are
sure to differ. One's friendship for
the store is the result of finding good
values; another's is the result of effi
cient service and courteous treatment,
and so on.
Naturally this frieudshiply feeling on
the part of our patrons is reciprocated
on our part. And this spirit of mutual
friendship is an impetus for greater
service and an incentive to ever-increasing
endeavor to make this store
a place where every visitor will feel
perfectly at home.

OUR INDIVIDUAL PART.
Some observers think that the
most characteristic thins about
the American soldiers in Prance,
something which astounds the
enemy and excites the admira
tion of our allies, is the capacity
of the American soldiers to do
individual thinking and fighting.
The German fights successfully
only in mass formation, in or
ganized bodies, while every Am
erican soldier has an initiative
and independence of action which
gives him remarkable efficiency
in open fighting. They are not
senseless cogs, but each is an
individual working unit in a
great fighting machine.
Every American at home should
feel an individual responsibility
and do his or her individual part
in winning the war. There is
not an American citizen who can
not help win the war. The
Fourth Liberty Loan drive, which
begias today, offers a great op
portunity for concerted action
and for individual action, and
the loan will be a tremendous
success if each American will do
his or her individual part as
each American soldier in France
does his part. Our soldiers de
serve such support from the
people at home.
STING OF SCORPION FATAL.
Letha, the little year and a
half old daughter of Mr. and
Mrs. W. C. Adams, who live a
mile west of Tempe, says the
News, died early Thursday morn
ing as the result of being stung
by a scorpion Wednesday night.
The poison spread rapidly
through hei system as she was
stung on one of the large veins
of her arm, and notwithstanding
that prompt medical aid was
had, it was impossible to save
the life of the little one and she
passed away shortly after mid
night. The Border Vidette has
time and again warmed parents
about the probable fatal results
of children, and especially very
small ones, being stung by scor
pions. A sting by one of the
insects upon an adult person
that would be only a slightly
painful inconvenience for a short
time, to a small child would soon
prove fatal. Children should
not be permitted to play about
rubbish piles and old stone walls
as these are the hiding places of
the scorpion.
Cavalry Officers' Training School
The general government wants
700 young men between the ages

J. Herman, 10th Cavahy, Noga
les, Arizona, with full informa

board, serial and order number.
Applicants are requested to act
quickly.
Appointed Hospital Chaplain.
Rev George C. Golden, rector
of St. Andrew's church, has
been appointed chaplain at the
new military hospital at Whip
ple Barracks which the general
government has established at
that point, and is enlarging the
plant to accommodate the equip
ment. Mr. Golden expects to
lea ye Nogales for his new field
of endeavor about the 15 prox.
It is reported that Rev. White
field of Bisbee, will be sent to
St. Andrew's church.
Hn Shih ch'an, candidate of
the generals of China's northern
army, has been elected president
of China. Hsu has been one of
the most prominent and influen
tial figures in China for many
years, having held important
posts in the government in sev
eral regimes. He helped to con
duct negotiations in settlement
of the Russo Japanese war. On
the abdication of Hsuan Tung
he became guardian of the boy
emperor, and at the same time
held the important positions of
Grand Councillor to Yuan Shih
kai and Vice Prime Minister.
He was a "Sworn Brother" of
Yuan Shih-kai and one of "The
Four Friends of Sungchan"
(Yuan), and always accorded
special honors in intercourse
with the tnen president.
Hsu Shih-ch'ang becomes Chi
na's isecond duly elected presi
dent; Li Yuan hung and Feng
Kuochang having served out
the time of Yuan Shih kai, Chi
na's first president.
Get Back to Manhood Suffrage.
Ten thousand voters failing to
register or vote in one large
county of a western state at the
recent primary is a significant
fact.
Complicated election laws, the
trouble and expense of repeated
registration and elections makes
voting unpopular.
Larger and larger numbers of
citizens refuse to vote and refuse
to become candidates, there is
so much red tape to comply with
The nomination and election
laws of most states comprised a
large volume and the annual
cost of elections is becoming
burdensome.
The labor unions, socialists,
non-partisan league and radicals
generally are organized and
vote.
That any obstacles should be
placed in the way of any Amer
ican citizen taking part in an
election is a paradox. -
It is the aggregate expressed
intelligence of the people that
constitutes democracy, and to
minimize that expression is a
crime against a Republican form
of government.
We must get back to simpler
manhood suffrage.
Industries Versus Brainstorms.
A town in a western state an
nounces establishment of a wheel
barrow factory Nov. 1st.
The same town has spent
thousands on Chautauquas, re
vivals, moral waves and other
non-productive enterprises.
It now turns with satisfaction
to a wheelbarrow factory that
will produce something useful
give some individuals a chance
to earn a living.
The brainstorm peddler's wares
range all the way from amend
ments to the constitution to new
ways of going to heaven.
With them it is anything to
get out of working for a living
at anything that smacks like
honest productive industry.
The brainstorm artist has had
some education as a rule, and
makes pretence to superior in
telligence and higher moral
standards.
He is not interested in pay
rolls, industries, business, tax
paying or any of the humbler
problems of the ordinary citizen.
Lucky for the community that
turns its back on brainstormers
and starts building up industries
as the basis of community pros
perity. The Mowry mines have open
ed up two of their shafts and
have now developed more than
200,000 tons of manganese ore.
The silica content of the ore is
higher than the management
wishes to ship, and plans for the
concentration of the ore arc now
well under way. It is stated
that the ore is amenable to both
jigging and log-washing, as
either process gives a large capa
city per unit cost, and it is cer
tain this property should soon
be shipping a large tonnage of
high-grade concentrates. Pata
on ian .
Those who attended the Red
Cross dinner Sunday at the
ranch home of Mr. and Mrs.
Arthur B. Young at Canille, say
the attendance was the largest
yet seen at former functions of
the kind throughout the county.
Almost the entire neighborhood
was present as well as large
crowds from Nogales, Patago
nia, and as far away as Tomb
stone and Bisbee. At the first
three regular tables set, sixty
six persons sat down after
which there was almost a con
stant stream until well toward
the middle of the afternoon.
National Guard Training School Opens
The Philippine National Guard
training school has been opened
with approximately 700 student
officers enrolled from every pro
vince in the islands. The course
is divided into an adjutant
school, a school for the quarter
master department, a school for
engineers, a school for the me
dical department, a school for
division trains and a school for
field signal battalion. It is ex
p?cted that the National Guard
will be federalized about Novem
ber 1. Arms, equipment and
uniforms will be issued by the
department commander as soon
as the guard is federalized.
WILL JOIN THE COLORS.
Harold J. Brown former chief
of police and also a former De
puty United States Marshal, has
concluded to set aside all per
sonal matters and join the col
ors. He went before the local
board and stated that he would
not put in any claim for exemp
tion, although he has a wife and
children, but was ready to go
and do his best. Therefore he
will entrain for Camp Kearney
with the contingent to go Octo
ber 7. He will go as a 1017 re
gistrant. Accept New School Building.
At a meeting of the school
trustees of the Nogales district
Monday evening, the contract
ors Lown and Wood formally
turned over the new grammar
school building, which was duly
accepted. The contract was com
pleted in a remarkably short
time and the work was well done
in all particulars.
Poker Playing Not Unlawful.
Deputy County Attorney H.
Wupperman of Yuma, has made
public an opinion that it is not
against the Arizona laws for
any individuals to play poker or
any similar game for money,
provided the game has no "bank
ing" features; that is, is not run
for a profit of a manager or
house holder. He is inclined to
the belief that the owner or
manager of such a game would
come within the purview of the
law, but not the players.
The gist of the opinion is that
gambling is not illegal merely
the running of gambling houses.
The sheriff and chief of police
of Yuma state their desire to
stop all gambling and complain
their hands are tied.
Assessment Work Be Suspended
During War.
The house committee ordered
a favorable report on the bill for
the suspension of assessment
work on mining claims during
the period of the war. The ne
cessity of this bill becoming a
law is obvious, the lack of labor
in the mining camps being an
upstanding feature. Miners and
especially mine owners of un
patented claims, have no desire
for the employment of imported
labor and it will soon be impos
sible to secure any other, as the
government needs in shipbuild
ing and other industries is at
tracting the batter workmen
among the miners.
The Consolidated Arizona Cop
per Company, recently organiz
ed, has just received a complete
shaft installation, and the work
of developing the property will
now begin in earnest. Patago
nian.
The cattlemen have one of
fieir members nominated for
governor of Arizona in Fred. T.
Colter, and it will be a wise
thing for them to get in behind
him and see that he gets elect
ed. No matter what the copper
owned press say about him, he
will stand for all the people, be
cause he wears nobody's collar.
Fred. Colter is a big, broad,
minded western man, who will
be fair to all classes, but he will
not stand for the copper barons
to get the valuations on range
cattle raised out of all propor
tions, like they did last year.
Arizona Cattleman.
AGAIN BREAKS RECORD.
The cattle fever tick is en
titled to think that the world's
energies have not been concen
trated on the western battle
front. The tick is having a
rather busy time, for July, like
June, seta new record in the
eradication work of the Bureau
of Animal Industry. In July
the number of cattle dipped for
ticks totaled 6,080,232 more
than were ever dipped in any
single month since the work be
gan in 1000.
Will Teach Filipino Recipes in Schools
Emphasis is hereafter to be
placed on teaching Filipino
school children the preparation
of native foods instead of stress
European recipes, as formerly.
Attention has been called by
Mr. Osias, assistant director of
the bureau of education, to the
desirability of nationalizing and
preserving certain Filipino dish
es which otherwise promise to
be forgotten by members of the
coming generation, and modifi
cations in the domestic science
course are now being made.
Registrations at Tempe Normal.
So far, says the News, there
have been three hundred and
seventy pupils registered at the
Normal. Of this number but
seventy are males. Usually the
per centage of males is much
greater, but this year it seems the
war has called to the colors so
many of the boys that now there
is a much greater per centage of
girls in this school as well as in
other educational institutions of
the state.

Filipino Students Support Red Cross.
Every student in the Manila
high school joined the Red Cross
in the recent campaign inau
gurated by Director of Educa
tion Marquardt among Filipino
school children. Contributions
to the amount of $579 were re
ceived from the students and
teachers of this school. Total
receipts from the islands am
ounted to over $350,000, of which
the provinces contributed more
than $75,000.
Shake-Up of Milk Dealers.
The municipal milk inspector
has been inspecting and testing
milk offered for sale in Nogales,
Sonora, with a result that he
has poured out into the street
some 25 gals, of milk and water.
Fourteen of the samples tested
were half water. The official
reported that milk received from
Phoenix stood the test.
For More Wireless Stations.
The Philippine government
has released an appropriation of
$37,500 lor the erection of a
wireless station in Manila. Other
appropriations provide for sta
tions at Cebu, Bongao, Puerto
Princess, and San Jose, Min
doro. The World's Fair mine expects
to have its 100 ton mill "turning
over" within the next 30 days.
This mill is designed to treat
the sulphide ores within the
mine and upon the dumps. It is
estimated that there is now a
large tonnage of good grade
milling ore broken in the old
stopes and also that much of the
dump will return a good profit
when milled. The mill is a com
bination specilic gravity and oil
flotation plant. Patagonian. oJic bottle 3tridtttc

COLTER STANDS PAT.
Choice of Arizona's Democracy for
Governor Assumes Responsibity.
Phoenix, Ariz., Sept. 20, 1918
Mr. Geo. J. Storreman,
Phoenix, Arizona.
My dear Mr. Stoneman:
I am advised through your
letter of the 13th instant, copy
of which appeared in a local
paper, of your decision that the
Democratic State Central Com
mittee need not be convened at
this time to consider the nomi
nation of a Democratic candi
date for Governor, provided that
I shall personally assume all re
sponsibility for your action in
refraining from the issuance of
a call to the Committeemen.
To your suggested disposition
of this matter I cheerfully and
confidently accede, knowing, as
I do, that the Democratic voters
of Arizona, who honored me
with the nomination as candidate
for Governor in the recent Pri
mary, will expect me to defend
the trust which they reposed in
me, and to be the Party's stand
ard bearer in the campaign now
beginning. Such resixnsibility
therefore, as attaches to your
withholding of a call for im
mediate meeting of the Demo
cratic Central Committee is as
sumed wholly by myself with
the nndertanding that I alone
shall be answerable to the Dem
ocratic Party of Arizona for the
deferring of a meeting until the
new Central Committee now be
ing organized, shall be convened
in accordance with law. This
procedure, I heartily believe,
will reflect the wishes of Ari
zona's Democracy and will best
serve the interests of the Demo
cratic Party.
In reaching this decision,
without any hesitancy whatever,
I act with full knowledge of the
Statutory and Constitional pro
visions cited in your letter, none
of which I regard as applicable
to myself as a candidate for
Governor. It is rather my cer
tain conviction, supported by
the opinions of able attorneys,
and reinforced by many judicial
decisions, which they can cite if
occasion requires, that I am i'N
DODBTEDI.Y AND I 'NICEST ION -ABLY
F.LIOIBLR TO THE GOVEIi
ship op Arizona, if I receive a
majority of the votes cast at the
November election.
To conclude, I cannot regard
the far fetched sophistries of
the Republican Central Com
mittee regarding my alleged dis
qualification as being other than
an absolute absurdity, calculat
ed, without doubt, to serve as
"campaign thunder" but having
no other useful purpose.
Thanking you for your kind
co operation, I am
Yours for Democracy,
(Signed) Fred T. Colter.

Filled Soldier's Hat With Tobacco.
A troop train passing through
Yuma recently, says the Sun,
carried a large number of draft
ed young men from Oklahoma
and other eastern points. One
of the soldiers at a point on the
railroad west of Gila Bend lost
his hat out of the car window.
It was the regulation hat and in
the hat band was a message to
his mother. A railroad conduct
or passing the point where the
hat was lost descried it and sent
a wire back to the section gaug
to look for the hat. It was found
and brought into Yuma. At
Kinney's cigar stand it was put
on exhibition and a lot of the
railroad boys and others "chip
ped it" and made up a purse
sufficiently large to buy enough
tobacco and cigarettes to till the
hat and in this condition the
hat, carefully done up into a
neat package, will be sent to the
commanding officer of the re
giment at Camp Kearney, to
which camp these boys were
bound. In due time the hat will
reach its rightful owner with the
gift of tobacco and cigarettes
from the railroad boys and
others of Yuma. It was only a
soldier's hat, but it will carry a
message of good cheer and kind
ly greeting to the man and his
comrades who passed our way.
