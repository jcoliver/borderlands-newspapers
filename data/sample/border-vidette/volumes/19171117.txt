RtMEMBtri THE BOYa IN CAMP.'
A friend of the enlisted men
has offered the following sugges
tion: " "If you know a soldier lad,
write to him. Tell him anything
or nothing. But write I known the
feeling that comes when all the
rest of the boys are getting let
ter from home and none comes to
you. It makes one sick at heart.
Girls can do a distinct service by
writing to their friends and
others in camp. And send little
gifts too. Send a box of candy
occasionally, and some tobacco.
But remember the lads. They'er
away from home doing strenuous
work. We can't feel that you
people back at home are doing
your full duty if you don't re
member the boys in camp."
From Camp Funston comes
corroboration in the following
extract from the letter of a high
private of Arizona artillery:
"We are all anxious to bear
from the outside and especially
from friends back home. To see
the disappointed look on some
fellow's face when bs name is
not called when the officer dis
tributes the mail my! but you
feel like writing him a letter
yourself, just for encouragement."

How to Send Mail to Soldiers.
Recognizing the unusual signi
ficance of the coming Christmas
tide to our military, naval and
civilian forces abroad, the
postoffice department has made
special arrangements to effect
timely delivery of all Christmas
parcels addressed to the Ameri
can expeditionary forces over
seas. Owing to the unusual distance
this mail must be transported, it
is absolutely necessary that all
parcels be covered with wrappers
of sufficient strength not only to
resist pressure of other mail
contained in the sacks, but to
withstand the weight of other
sacks of mail which will be piled
thereon.
Each package will be examin
ed at the local office before its
acceptance, and the covering
should be so secured as to admit
ready inspection.
Parcel post packages address
ed for delivery abroad must be
mailed at the main postoffice,
and not at the local stations.
The postage rates are twelve
cents for each pound or fraction
thereof, and cannot be sent as
registered oi insured mail.
Owing to the great demand
for transportation space, patrons
are urged to make their packages
as small as possible, the limit of
weight being seven pounds.
Smaller parcels will be given the
preference in shipment in order
to accommodate the greatest
number of persons.
In the use of Christmas stick
ers, care should be taken hot to
seal the parcels. Stickers should
not be placed on the address
side of parcels and to do so will
make the parcel unmailable.
Such endorsement as "Merry
Christmas" or "Do not open
until Christmas" may be placed
on the wrapper in such a man
ner as not to interfere with the
address.
The company, regiment or
other organization, followed by
the words, "American expedi
tionary force," should follow the
address.

Consul Lawton has wired
"Washington for instructions
regarding the issuance of pass

CALLES IS LOYAL.
The following telegram from
Douglas, dated November 15th,
will be interesting to both friends
and enemies of Governor P.
Eli as Calles of Sonora:
Gov. P. Elias Calles of Sonora
is loyal to the Carranza govern
ment and will use the armed
strength of the state to maintain
allegiance to federal authority,
according to Consul Ives G.
Lelevier and Col. A. Camou,
military commander of the north
eastern district of Sonora. To
night Mr. Lelevier said:
The report that Gen. Calles
is planning a secession move
ment in Sonora is without basis
of truth and is, I think, circulat
ed by enemies of President Car
ranza, in the United States, with
the desire to cause friction be
tween the federal government
and the state of Sonora."
Colonel Camou said tonight:
"I am in almost constant touch
with General Calles and yester
day I received orders from him
to be on the lookout for any dis
loyal interest which might be
active on this part of the border.
I have wired him for an official
My words are feeble .to convey
tbe intense appreciation of my
self, and all our children, for
the almost overwhelming kind
ness and sympathy shown by so
many many friends to my belov
ed wife, and the loving mother,
who passed from our sight, and
which we all desire to say will
never be forgotten.

The Spirit of Friendship.
This store looks upon its patrons not
merely as customers but as friends.
People purchase here because they
have friendly feeling for this store.
The cause which develops this friendly
feeling, may differ, in fact, they are
sure to differ. One's friendship for
the store is the result of finding good
values; another's is the result of effi
cient service and courteous treatment, 4'

Naturally this friendshiply feeling on

on our part. And this spirit of mutual
friendship is an impetus for greater
service and an incentive to ever-increasing
endeavor to make this store
a place where every visitor will feel
perfectly at home.

presented to the United States
Consul for proier visa, which
will be sufficient to secure the
return of the alien to the United
States.
Mexican citizens residing in
Mexico must secure a similar
provisional passport from the
Mayor or President of their
town, and this should be pre
sented for visaing to the United
States Consul before admission
to the United States can be se
cured.
Americans in Mexico desir
ing to come to the United States
must apply to the United States
Consul in Mexico for a regular
State Department passport. A
certified copy of the application,
or an appropriate certificate
from the United States Consul
to the effect that passport has
been applied for will be sufficient
to secure entrance to the United
States until such time as the
passport has been received.
American citizens living in the
United States must make appli
cation for a regular State Depart
ment passport to the Clerk of
the United States Federal Court,
in the district in which they
reside. A certified copy of appli
cation or certificate that applica
tion has been made will be suffi
cient to secure entry on their
return provided that the United
States Consul approves or visaes
same.
Cards which have heretofore
been issued by the Immigration
Service and "seen" by the
United States Consul, after
appropriate form has been ex
ecuted, will be sufficient until
regular passports have been
secured, or until a reasonable
time during which passports
could have been secured, has
expired, such time to be a matter
for future instructions.
