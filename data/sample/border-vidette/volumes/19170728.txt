There was a big rabbit drive
in the Casa Grande section last
Sunday when all the farmers for
miles around and the town peo
pie turned out and rounded up
poor Jack Rabbit and killed some
600 of him. Much depredation
has been done by rabbits in that
section, especially to cotton
crops some of which were entire
ly destroyed by the pests. The
scalps of the rabbits were taken
and will be presented to the
board of supervisors and the
county money donated to the
Red Cross. The bounty is 5
cents per scalp. Blade Tribune.

Cantonm;nts Named For Men Ot
Fame.
Names of American military
heroes have been given by the
war department to thirty-two
cantonments in which the na
tional army and the national
guard will be mobilized for train
ing. In each case the name select
ed is that of a man from the sec
tion represented by the troops
concerned. Short names were
chosen for convenience, names
like Washington and Lincoln
were omitted because of the
temporary nature of the camps
and other names avoided because
they are duplicated by promin
ent men now living. Among
the names chosen for the nation
al army, are:
Camp Grant, Rockford, 111.,
for troops from Illinois. After

ed as colonel of the Twenty-first

A GOOD SHOWING.
Homesteaders Can Get Federal Loan.
Advices received from the fed
eral land bank at Berkley, give
homesteaders the right to secure
loans, the interpretation from
Washington, being as follows:
That where a homestead en
tryman on Government home
stead has in good faith occupied
the land for the requisite period
and made final proof by virtue of
such settlement, bis land office
receipt may be acepted as evid
ence of basic title for the pur
pose of a loan under the. Fed
eral farm loan system. Where
homestead entrymen commute
at the end of fourteen months
and pay for their lands, the
board will insist upon patent
having been granted before a
loan will be passed.
In regard to stock raising, the
board regards the use of money
borrowed for the purpose of pur
chasing sheep, as strictly within
the federal loan law, and alto
gether commendable. The Ariz
ona Stockman.
Albert Davinson, who runs
the automobile stage between
Patagonia and Nogales, is hav
ing a good business of late. This'
stage line is a great convenience
for residents of the two towns
and should be liberally patroniz
ed. The roads are in very fair
condition now, and with the big
automobile used by Mr. David
son, the trip to the county seat
and return is a pleasure.

through the State Land Com
missioner's office, a total of $337,
355.77 for the fiscal year July 1,
1916 to June 30, 1917.
Of this sum $29,003.47 was
collected for fees on applications
to select, lease and purchase
lands, as well as for issuing
leases, patents and certificates
of purchase, and assignments of
leases and certificates of pur
chase, which money, up to July
1, 1917, was used for the main
tenance of the State Land De
partment. The Classification and Ap
praisement fee represents $16,

vestigation and demonstration
of State lands:
School Land Rentals $7'.53'.79.

within the State, under Section
III of the Public Land Code,
and amendments passed by the
Third State Legislature, which
provide for the loan of 50 per
cent of the appraised value of
the lands in the State.
On July lO, 1917, there had
been loaned by the State, on
farm lands in the different coun-.
ties of the State, approximately
$350,000,00, which exhausted
the available money for loan at
that time; however, there is
daily being received, by Com

money is promptly remitted to

comes available for loan.

Advance In Price of Tungsten.
Tungsten, getting out from
under control of the people who
have been manipulating the
prices, jumped to more than
double its former value within
the last few days. From $14 a
unit it has gone to $25 and $30 a
unit.
Scheelite, the kind of ore pro
duced in all parts of the South
west with the exception of John
son camp, where wolframite is
the type of ore, is preferred, and
a premium of from $2 to $3 per
unit above the market price is
being paid for it, according to
well-informed mining men.
Several properties in northern
Sonora, which have tungsten in
the form of scheelite ore doubt
less will produce at top speed
and ship as soon as possible in
order to take advantage of the
upward trend of the market.
This should result in a consider
able revival of the mining indus

is given considerable credence
by men residing at Duquesne

The source of the big fund in
the hands of the I. W. W. in
Arizona has been traced direet
to German hands at Hermosillo
and Guaymas, by Cochise coun
ty officials, according to reports
received here today, says Wed
nesday Tucson Star.
Some time ago two Mexicans
Tvere arrested in Tucson with
$50,000 in gold in their posses
sion. They claimed to be en
route to Chihuahua and as they
had declared l he money at No
gales were released. This is
believed to be only one of sev
eral large consignments of coin
sent by German agents in Sono
ra to I. W. W. representatives
in Arizona through Mexican
hands.
It is said also that some of the
messengers entrusted with the
money never reported. One of
these was a large consignment
for Bisbee. When the messenger
reached the United States, he
found that the I. W. W. had been
deported from Bisbee and im
mediately left for Los Angeles.

THIRD PAYMENT DUE.
The third payment of twenty
percentum on Liibery Loan BoDds
purchased by -installments is due
on July 30th. The payment
must be made on or before that
date according to the official
statement of terms and condi
tions of the sale of Liberty Loan

Adoo at the time subscriptions
were invited.
Whether the bonds were pur
chased from the Treasury or the

it is important that these and
succeeding installments be paid
promptly.
The action of many employers
of labor in arranging to pay their
employees on 'July 30th instead
of August 1st in order to enable
them to promptly make their
payments on Liberty Loan
Bonds is an excellent and pa
triotic example which no doubt
will be followed by a large num
