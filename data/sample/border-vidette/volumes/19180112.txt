This morning two trains of
soldiers passed through King
man to an unknown destination.
The men were volunteers and a
fine looking lot of fellows. They
stopped over in town an hour to
drill and to take a hike around
the outskirts. Miner.
New Years' day was enjoyed
in the San Rafael valley by a
large gathering of people from
the surrounding country who
had arranged a program of
sports, including horse races.
There are some sadder but wiser
men who attended the sports.
Patagonian.
The possibility of a smelter
for Patagonia is very bright, as
Mr. E. R. Shaw and associates
of San Francisco are still en
deavoring to secure enough good
ground leases to insure the
smelter's being kept busy in case
other producers do not desire to
patronize it.
There will be no more wind
mills erected on the Babacomari
grant, according to "Joe Bush,"
the versatile investigator of na
tural phenomena, who lives at
Huachuca Siding. He claims
that there is not wind enough to
run what there is now, and any
additional mills will redifce the
power.
The area of the State of Ari
zona is equal to the approximate
areas of Connecticut, Massa
chusetts, New Hampshire, Ver
mont, Maine and New York. Its
area is greater than all of New
York, Pennsylvania, Maryland
and Delaware; or Illinois, In
diana, New Hampshire and New
Jersey combined.
Small shippers of copper ore
are steadily dropping out of pro
duction and shutting down their
properties in different parts of
the state, because the govern
ment fixed price of 231 cents per
pound does not afford them op
portunity to earn profit on the
rising scale of costs for all ma
terials they employ."
Bids for the $1,000,000 issue of
highway bonds that were re
cently voted by the citizens of
Cochise county will be opened
on Monday, February 4th. It
is expected that there will be no
difficulty in disposing of them,
as they offer a safe investment
at five and a half per cent.
These are the first road bonds
ever issued by the county.
Harold Bell Wright, the au
thor, and F. W. Taylor, man
ager of the Tucson Farms Co.,
are reported to have leased the
residence of Dr. A. E. Douglas
of the University at 1189 Speed
way for the winter. Dr. Doug
las is building a new house near
Olive road. Mr. Wright will
use the quarters for the creation
of his new novel. Tucson Star.
Some good molybdenum ore is
being brought to Patagonia from
Duquesne for shipment. Molyb
denum is in demand at present
and is bringing more than $400
per ton. The metal is used in
the manufacture of steel and in
the preparation of ammonium
molybdate for laboratory use, as
a disinfectant, to color pottery,
porcelain, leather and rubber,
and to dye silks and woolens.
Santa Cruz Patagonian.
Apache Indians, 111 of them,
gave two dollars apiece to the
Red Cross at Globe, Arizona.
Their leader deposited $222 and
gave notice that others from the
San Carlos reservation would
soon apply for membership. The
wards of Uncle Sam have re
sponded nobly and many Indian
boys from the various tribes
have enlisted in the army. They
seem to realize fully that our
government is worth fighting
for.
Ajo presented the only large
new copper producer in the state
of Arizona this year, the New
Cornelia Copper company in that
district making above 20,000,000
pounds in the six months of its
operation. In 1918 the company
will probably make another re
cord in expansion of producing
area in the state. New Cornelia
was enable to produce through
the investment of nowards of
$6,000,000 in equipment. It has
added $35,000,000 to the assess
ed valuation of Pima county.
Many requests have come to
the Arizona Stace Bureau of
Mines recently from people out
side of the state who are eager
to get in touch with the owners
of bat guana deposits, and inas
much as there are many caves,
particularly in the southern part
of Arizona, in which there are
quantities of this material, it is
thought that these requests can
be easily met.
The percentage of divorce suits
filed to marriage licenses grant
ed in Pima county during the
calendar year of 1917 was 13.7
as shown by an examination of
the records in the office of the
clerk of the superior court by a
Citizen reporter. This is one in
sevena high percentage ascom
paied with the proportion exist
ing in other parts of the coun
try, where the average has been
one in 11 for some years past.
.The Castle Butte is looking
better with each round of shots.
The new owners are well pleas
ed with their investment. They
encountered the ore body near
the suface in a new shaft, and
deeper the work went the richer
ore became. It is high grade,
copper glance being in evidence
throughout the ledge being cut.
Messrs. Miller and Scheerer are
very fortunate in securing the
property at a low figure and
most agreeable terms. Patago
nian. The military department of
the University of Arizona has
designated nineteen graduates
and undergraduates of the Un
iversity to attend the Third Of
ficers' Training Camp, at Camp
Kearney, California, beginning
January 5, 1918. Eight of the
fourteen men who were under
graduates were members of the
varsity squad of 1917. This list
.will add considerably to the al
ready admirable list of Arizona
men in government military ser
vice. Tax payments of copper pro
ducers in Arizona this year to
county and state will be about
one cent the pound on every
pound made. The production
will probably be a little better
than 700,000,000 pounds, mean
ing upwards of $7,000,000 paid
by the copper producers in sus
taining county and state. But
for the interferences by I. W. W.
and other pro German and radi
cal influences which caused the
shutting down of several large
properties during part of the
year, there would have been
300,000,000 more pounds of cop
per made this year than there
will be record of.

Fifty-six more Y. M. C. A.

GERMAN LIES AND PROPAGANDA
From all parts of the country
come stories of the work of Ger
man propagandistas in circulat
ing stories about the war, about
the conditions at the front and
about the situation at home. The
Philadelphia North American
quotes a few of these stories, as
follows:
"In the treason factory output
are stories that American battle
ships have been sunk by the
German navyand the news sup
pressed; that thousands of Am
erican soldiers have been killed;
that a German army is to invade
us through Canada; that hun
dreds of thousands of Germans
in this country are drilling for a
revolt; that Secretary Tumulty
is in jail, charged with treason;
that our troops in France are
suffering' for food; that our
troops in France have quarreled
with the British; that articles
knitted for the soldiers have
gone to the officers. They are
all lies."
The same paper calls to mind
a few typical stories about the
food situation, as follows:
"That Herbert Hoover, federal
food administrator, gets a salary
of $12,000 and lives in luxury.
It is a lie. He gives his services
to the country, without salary,
and lives simply.
"That, at Camp Mix or Camp
Meade, quarters of beef are
thrown away or burned. It is
a lie.
"That tons of vegetables, prin
cipally potatoes, are rotting
through the carelessness of sol
diers. It is a lie.
"That whole carloads of fruit
are decaying on the railroad
tracks, because the commission
men want to get high prices. It
is a lie.
"That French army officers
have been shot for selling Am
erican wheat to Germany. It is
a lie.
"That Canada is holding its
wheat so that it can demand a
In a communication received
by this paper, Collector of In
ternal Revenue, Louis T. Car
penter, announces that a federal
income tax officer will be sent
into Santa Cruz county on Feb
ruary 6, and will be here until
February 12, 1918. He will
have his office in Nogales, and
will be here every day ready
and willing to help persons sub
ject to the income tax make oat
their returns without any cost
to them for his services.
Returns of income for the year
1917 must be made on forms pro
vided for the purpose before
March 1, 1918. Because a good
many people don't understand
the law and won't know how to
make out their returns, the gov
ernment is sending in this ex
pert to do it for them. But the
duty is on the taxpayer to make
himself known to the govern
ment. If he doesn't make re
turn as required before Marcb
1, he may have to pay a penalty
ranging from $20 to $f,000, pay
j a. fine or go to jail. So if you
going to jail, you better call on
the income tax man. If you are
not sure about being subject to
the tax, better ask him and
make sure. Whether you see
the income tax man o not, you
must make return if subject to
tax.
Of course, persons resident in
other counties may, if they want
to, come and see the income tax
man who will be here Feb. 6.
The Collector suggests that
everybody start figuring up now
his income and expenses so as
to be ready with the figures
when the expert arrives. Ex
penses, however, don't mean
family expenses, money used to
pay off the principal of a debt,
new machinery, buildings, or
anything like that. They mean
what you spend in making your
money interest, taxes paid,
hired help, amount paid for
goods sold, seed, stock bought
for feeding, rent (except for
your dwelling), etc. Income in
cludes about every dollar you
got.
BACK ON THE JOB.
Gov. Geo. W. P. Hunt is back
on the job and he started in
again on his duties as governor
of Arizona on Christmas day,
thanks to the decision of the
supreme court.
After an absence of a year,
during which time lie stood
passively by and witnessed the
kind of government that comes
through a Republican adminis
tration, the duly elected Demo
cratic governor of the State of
Atizona, is once more at the
helm to guide the Ship of State
through the turbulent passages
of the political sea.
Governor Hunt is a Democrat
and as the duly acknowledged
leader of the Democracy of this
State, the Democrats of this
State should stand solidly be
hind him and give him full
party support in his efforts to
maintain a Democratic govern
ment for the people of Arizona.

CITIZENS OF NOGALES.
The Secretary of the Chamber
of Commerce has sent the fol
lowing notice to citizens of No
gales, which are self-explanatory:
"Nogales has the big job of
entertaining the Arizona Cattle
Growers' Association on Febru
ary 14th, 15th and 16th. Noga
les has a reputation to uphold
for its hospitality.
"It is estimated that over five
hundred will attend this conven
tion. This large number cannot
be cared for at the hotels.
"In order that the Committee
may know immediately just what
to expect in tbe way of satis
factory accommodations, we
would request that you state on
attached card to what extent
you are willing to discommode
yourself to take one or more of
the visitors into your home for
three days. We know you will
go tbe limit in backing up the
Chamber in providing accommo
dations. It is very important
that immediate attention be given
to tbis matter. We will assume
that what you state you can do
now may not be possible a month
hence as circumstances might
prevent; still an estimate ob
tained now wiil assist the com
mittee in making plans.
"If you have no room, answer
questions in regard to car anyway."
EARLY MORNING FIRE.
Early last Wednesday morn
ing lire broke out in the upper
story of the old Banco de So
nora building in Nogales, So
nora, and in a very short time
the roof and upper story of the
handsome structure were in ruins
The UDper story was occupied
by Delfina Rochin de Vergobi,
whose curio and fancy goods
store occupied a portion of the
lower floor, and Dr. Darby, the
dentist. Their loss by fire and
water is considerable.
The cause of the fire is not
known.
There was no insurance.
On account of the fact that
the upper story floor was built
of cement, the fire did not reach
the rooms on the first floor
However, what the fire did not
injure, the water did, and the
big stock of goods owned by
Mrs. Vergobi, is almost a com
Dlete loss.
Fortunately there was very
little wind, and the Nogales, So
nora, fire fighters were able to
prevent the flames from spread
icg to adjacent buildings.
Headed by Chief Bracey Cur
tis, the Nogales, Arizona fire de
partmeut rushed to the scene,
and quickly stretched two lines
of hose on International street,
to protect buildings on the
American side of the line.
The loss to the building, which
is owned by .the Gamou family
of Hermosillo, is estimated at
about five thousand dollars.

WELL KNOWN ORATOR COMING
The success that has attended
the Arizona State Bureau of
Mines lecture course at Phoenix
will undoubtedly be repeated
when Mr. S. C. Dickinson ap
pears at the Santa Cruz Club on
January 14, 15 and 16, in the
same course.
The course is popular and put
up in such a way as to appeal to
all of the people, men, women
and children alike, and covers
probably one of the most im
poatant of our problems of the
present day, welfare and conser
vation of human life.
The evening lectures are open
to all. There will be a lecture
each evening which will be illus
trated by lantern slides and also
a moving picture show.
The men in the Bureau of
Mines lecture courses havebeen
selected largely because of their
breadth of experience in the
particular lines in which they
are teaching.
Mr. Dickinson, who is to lect
ure here on the above mention
ed dates, has been for a number
of years employed by the United
States Bureau of Mines in simi
lar work and in this work has
traveled extensively. He was
in charge of the demonstrations
of the U. S. Bureau at the San
Francisco and San Diego Ex
positions. The lecture course to be given-
by Mr. Dickinson is well worth
an effort to attend. Everybody
should understand and be able
to apply first aid to the injured
and the welfare problems of our
mining camps are bound to oc
cupy the attention of our law
makers of years to come.
The courses are free. While
here Mr. Dickinson expects to
meet for special lectures the
Womens' Club and high school
students.
If you are interested to come
the first night, Mr. Dickinson
will interest you enough to at
tend the otder meetings.

HUNT BETS TO BE PAID.
fi
fi Should Worry
There was a good deal of
money bet on the election last
year and the day of settlement
has come. Those who wagered
on a bare majority, who bet od
Hunt or Campbell, with or with
out odds, will now get a de
cision.
Gov. Hunt wins by a majority
of 43 votes. The decision of
the supreme court is final and
on January fi, fifteen days after
the decision, time elapses lor
motion for rehearing.
Probably Eddie Doyle holds
more stake money than any one
man. R. Allyn Lewis and Boyee
&'Creech have goodly sum? on
hand. Much of this was 2 to 1,
some as high as 4 to 1 on Hunt.
These bets, when no majority
was named, have all been de
cided in favor of Gov. Hunt.
Payment will be made Jan. 6.

An association has been form

known as the Vaughn Cattle
Growers' Association, its pur
pose being to provide water in
the national forest nearby and
to erect a drift fence so that the
cattle owned by its members will
get the full benefit of the graz
ing land in their territory, and
not be compelled toshare it with
the cattle from the Red Rock
district, which they are now com
pelled to do because there is no
way to keep cattle from drifting
across the mountains.
The association's plans ac
cording to our informant, have
been indorsed by the forest de

The readers of this paper will be
pleased to learn that there is at least
one dreaded disease that science has
been able to cure in all its stages, and
that is catarrh. Catarrh being greatly
influenced by constitutional conditions
requires constitutional treatment.
Hall's-Catarrh Cure is taken internally
and acts thru the Blood on the Mucous
Surfaces of the System thereby de
stroying the foundation of the disease,
giving the patient strength by building
up the constitution and assisting na

they offer One Hundred Dollars for any

THE LAST WORD IN MOVIES.
Quality Luggage for People
of Refinement
HAVE you ever considered how conspicuous your
luggage is when traveling and how much people
associate you with the impression it creates? If
you want the height of refinement, style and durability in traveling
goods you will find It in the Belber line, which, in our estimation, ia
the finest line of luggage made.
Your clothes need no re-pressing when you take them from a
Belber Wardrobe Trunk. Your hats, gloves, shoes and jewelry have
special drawers or compartments which are instantly available
when the trunk is opened.
Belber bags and suit cases are made of the highest grade
leathers. The Belber Fitall adjustable holder makes them won
derfully convenient, enabling you to get at your toilet accessories
instantly without disturbing the other contents, and at the same
time giving you the usual packing space.
Come in and see these goods.
