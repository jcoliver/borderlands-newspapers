TOMBSTONE'S SILVER OUTLOOK
0
With the future of silver as
sured for several years to come,
there is no reason why Tomb
stone, with her silver mines,
should not feel prosperity. There
is not a single property in the
Tombstone district with the'
least showing of silver that can
not be worked at a profit at pre
sent prices. Besides this there!
are many dumps that can be i
screened at a big profit with;
silver over $1.00 and bound to
climb higher. The statement
has been made that should the
price of the white metal go to
$1.25 that there is not one single
waste dump in this district that
could not be shipped at a profit.
There is a big field in Tomb
stone for miners and mining
men, and much property that is
still open for leae, not only
from the company but from in
dividual owners, who would be
glad to have their property de
veloped. Prospector.
The municipality of Tucson
went upon record as a booster
to the limit of the Fifth Liberty
Loan in Pima county late Satur
day when, at a special meeting
of the finance committee of the
council, it was voted to invest
$43,000 of the sinking fund of
the city in government bonds of
the fifth issue.
Carter Glass, Secretary of the
Treasury, has issued the follow
ing statement to the public:
Fellow Citizens:
The people of America enter
ed the war to protect the honor
and rights of the United States,
to safeguard the liberty of man
kind and to bring peace and
security to us, to do our part,
and whenever our government
called on us for men or money,
we answered gladly and gen
erously. ' .
We made up our minds to ap-
I ply "force without stint" to
aa . i
win at all costs, ana we nave
won, far more quickly than the
most optimistic of us thought
possible. The speed of our vic
tory saved tens of thousands of
American lives and billions of
dollars. It cost money to make
speed, but far less than would
have been necessary if we had
progressed slowly. It will cost
more money to bring our sol
diers back and care for the
wounded and pay the bills for
the war supplies which helped
so materially to bring a quick
victory. We have already taken
nearly $18,000,000,000 of gov
ernment securities and we are
asked to take in the Victory
Liberty Loan several billions
more.
Unless we as a people sub
scribe for this loan, leaving
banks free to provide funds for
the industry and commerce of
the country, business can not go
on and expand. That means
fewer jobs, poorer wages, and
loss of our present great oppor-
tunity for a commercial growth
and prosperity which would be
nefit Os all. If you want to help
keep the business in which you
are engaged prosperous enough
to lurnish you a steady, well-
paying job, join the majority of
your fellow citizens in taking as
much of the Victory Liberty
Loan as you can.
The prosperity of each one of
us depends on each doing his
nart. When the Liberty Loan
committee comes around to you
and asks for your subscription.
remember that it is oru debt;
remember that we are asked,
not trive. but to lend. And then
invest all vou possibly can in
the obligations of your govern
ment.
I am sure that every true Am
erican will do his part.
Cartkk Glass,
Secretary of the Treasury
Homesteads, with buildings
and equipment to make them
ready for immediate occupancy,
will be provided for soldiers and
sailors who wish to engage in
farming, if a bill proposed by
the Secretary ot the Interior is
not defeated by republicans in
the next congress, as was a like
measure in the last.
Secretary Lane's plan is to
purchase lands in all sections of
the country, to subdivide the
tracts thus acquired, to build on
each parcel a house and barn,
and put the ground into condi
tion for use for truck gardening,
farming or grazing, as the char
acter of the soil, the climate and
other factors dictate. .
These settlements will not be
scattered haphazard, buff will be
established as communities so
that the homesteaders may have
the advantages of churches,
schools, telephones, " transporta
tion and, markets. The govern
ment will allow the soldiers and
sailors a maximum of forty years
in which to pay for their lands
and homes. Money will be ad
vanced also for the purchase of
machinery, equipment and live
stock. These loans will be for a
short period. Interest at the
rate of not more than 4 per cent
will be charged by the govern
ment. With the appropriation of
$100,000,000 which the bill will
authorize, the Interior Depart
ment estimates 25,000 home
steads, ranging in area from 5
tc 160 acres, can be purchased
and developed. The task of pre
paring the land for cultivation,
it is expected, will" afford em
ployment to many soldiers and
sailors. The whole undertaking
was delayed by the republican
filibuster, which killed the ap
propriation, along with many
other popular and salutary meas

H jm Til
Douglas, May 9. Fearful of
a recurrence tonight of the raid
mode early this morning by a
band of twenty two bandits un
der the leadership of a Mexican
who signed "Bias Plores, Viva
Villa," to a number of receipts
for goods stolen from stores of
Cananea, Sonora, the president?
municipal was sending mes
sages to Agua Prieta, Nogales
and Hermosillo, urging that as
sistance be sent him at once.
Captain Tato, conjmander of
the Agua Prieta garrison, as yet
is undecided as to his course,
awaiting orders from military
headquarters in Hermosillo. His
force consists of approximately
fifty gendarmes fiscales, or fiscal
guards,- there being no regular
soldiers in the town.
The reyised death list at Can
anea is seven, including the
chief of police, four policemen
and two civilians. Twenty-two
are said to have been wounded.
The raid started at 1:30 this
morning and came to a conclu
sion at 4:30. The raiders first
appeared in Ronquillo, the busi
ness section of the municipality.
After an unsucessful endeavor
to open the vault of the Banco
Mercantil, owned by Prank
Proctor of Los Angeles, and J.
M. Gibbs, American consular
agent and a resident of Cananea,
the bandits went to the home of
Mr. Almada, the cashier, forced
him to dress and go to the bank
with them. When he attempted
to demur, they are said to have
exhibited a business like bomb
which they threatened to use to
blow him and his family "into
eternity:' unless toe consented to
do their biddrhg. First reports
were that approximately $40,000
was taken from the safe, but
late this afternoon, a message
from Naco said Mr. Almada es
timated the amount stolen from
the bank at $22,000, American
gold.
Pour stores are said to have
been looted, among them La
Prancesa, owned by Pelix Bros,
the store of Said Talbet, that of
Hopkins Brothers and a Mexi
can jewery store. It is rumored
but not confirmed, that two
other scores were robbed. La
Francesa store was robbed of
goods valued at $5,000, while
several thousand dollars worth
of goods was stolen from the
other stores. No violence was
done to Americans or other
foreigners.
The raiders left Cananea four
hours after the raid started, go
ing southwest through Capote
Pass, three miles from the main
town, and toward Los Nogales
ranch in the foothills of the
Cananea mountains.
With two military trains bring
ing soldiers from Nogales and
points south of there to Cananea
late today and a home guard
formation under way in the
town, fear of another raid has
been largely dispelled.
The Santa Cruz Patagonian
says: "Oscar F. Ashburn has
taken a lease on 2000 acres of
oil land near Paintville, in John
son county, Kentucky, from
Gray Brothers, owners of the
Colicello group of mines. This
oil property has been in posses
sion of the Gray family for many
years and has been prospected
for oil at various times since the
Civil War days. Mr. Ashburn
intends to visit the property
early in June and if conditions
warrant development will at once
put down a deep well."

Francis Duffy Attending College.
Francis Duffy, son of Judge
Frank J. Duffy of Nogales, who
left the University of Arizona to
go overseas with the American
army, is now a student at the
American Army University at
Beaune, a short distance south
east of Pans.
The University is situated on
the site of a great base hospital
covering an area of twoquare
miles with a capacity of 17,000
patients.
Ten thousand students had
been enrolled .by the middle of
April, and the number was ex
pected to be doubled. The uni
versity is divided into a group
of colleges. The College of
Agriculture embraces courses in
animal husbandry, horticulture,
agronomy and rural culture and
sociology. It conducts a farm
of 600 acres for practical instruc
tion and demonstration. In ad
dition, there is an army farm
school forstudents not sufficient
ly advanced for the university.
Other branches of the univer
sity are the Colleges of Letters,
Science Business, Education,
Journalism, Law, Medical Scien
ces, and Music' Each student
must carry at least three lec
tures or recitation hours and
four and a half hours of study
periods five days a week. Stud
ents have the option of return
ing home with their organiza
tions or remaining to complete
the course.
A REPUBLICAN THREAT.
Business is turning quickly
and prosperously from the con
ditions of war to the status of
peace. All the signs are for a
complete rivival and a period of
activity without precedent. Em
ployment is increasing, wages-
are stable, new enterprises are
arising in all parts of the coun
try. Prospects for good har
vests are encouraging. All this
has come about without an extra
session of Cpngress and in spite
of the hurtful filibuster by which
Republicans defeated important
legislation at the very outset of
"reconstruction. "
If the Republican leaders of
the next Congress attempt to
hamper President Wilson, in
stead of going about the busi
ness of passing the measures
which a Democratic Administra
tration framed and would have
enacted but for their obstruc
tion, they will halt the recovery
of industry and invite trouble.
Not President Wilson, but tba
people at large will be the suf
ferers. It begins to appear,' however,
that discord and factionalism
will prevent the Republican ma
jority from adopting and pursu
ing an affirmative, constructive
course of legislation in the Six
ty sixth Congress. They were
almost unanimous in their oppo
sition to the Democratic pro
gram, but they give signs of
being hopelessly lacking in un
ity as to any other policy. But
there is something worse than
Republican inability to agree on
a plan of obstruction bad
though that be. That is, they
might combine to undo the good
work which the Democrats have
accomplished in the last six
years of their ascendancy. And
they have threatened to do that
very thing.
