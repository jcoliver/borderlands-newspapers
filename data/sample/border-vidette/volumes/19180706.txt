the suggestion of Wiley Jones,

get on the ballots sent to men in
the service for the primary elec

Mr. H. K. Welch, manager of
the Hardshell mine, reports the
mill at the property is in opera

and GO tons of ore daily. About
30 tons of concentrates are pro
duced daily. The mill was start
ed Tuesday. A drill is being
used to prospect the property,
and a 500 foot hole is to be put
down to cut the ore body. The
drill in use is the first of its kind
to be used in this district. It
extracts a 5 inch core from the
ground, which is of sufficient
size to give a fair idea of the
value of the ore encountered.

The Ashurst bill, which pass
ed the senate last week, and
which is expected to pass the
house, provides for the leasing
of mineral lands within the re
servations. The bill provides
for a royalty to be paid on all
ores extracted at the nominal
figure of five per cent net, at
the mine. Locators are requir
ed to perfect title in the same
manner that titles to any min
eral claims are now perfected in
the states or territories and $100
worth of annual labor must be
performed in accordance with
the U. S. law now in force. The
lessor also may lease lands con
tiguous to the mines for milling
or smelting purposes, at an an
nual rental of $1 per year, which
rental is to apply on the pay
ment of royalties, if any there
be. The secretary of the in
terior may lease or sell the sur
face ground of the mining claims
if such surface ground is not
deemed necessary to the welfare
of the mines. This, probably,
is due to the necessity of con
serving graising lands. The de
partment is also required to
collect an annual rental for the
grouud covered by the claims of
not less than 25 cents per acre
for the first year, 50 cents for
the second, third and fourth
years, and $1 for each year
thereafter, this to apply on the
royalty. The object of the rent
als is to compel the operation of
the mines during the life of the
lease, the lessee being penalized
for failure to extract and sell
ores. Miner.
How Far Behind the Boys Are You?
One of Pershing's men, re
turned from France, was speak
ing: "When I left for home," he
said, "the boy over there were
feeling pretty blue, because they
thought that you here in Amer
ica were not backing them up as
you ought. We had a pretty
bitter winter over there. The
weather was the coldest France
has known in years. Many of
us were without proper food and
clothing. Some were even with
out shoes. None of us were
complaining, though, but the
feeling that when we were doing
so much for you, you were not
doing everything in your power
to back us up sometimes bit in
pretty hard.
"We felt like the little Irish
man felt in a Y. M. C. A. hut
one evening. A bunch of us had
gathered there to listen to a
speaker from America. During
the course of his lecture he said:
" 'We in America are behind
you boys to a man.'
"Then my little Irish friend
got up. 'Yes,' he said, you're
all behind us, all right, a h.:..
of a ways behind 4,000 miles.' "
Are you that far behind "the
boys?" If you are, move up
closer. Put all your energy into
this War Savings Campaign.
Save to the utmost of your abil
ity and put your savings into
W. S. S., and get everyone else
to do the same. Make "the
boys" in France realize that
while the mileage may be great,
it is easily spanned by your will
ingness to help.

IOO PER CENT AMERICAN.
Memorial Introduced by Mrs. Geo. B.
Marsh of Santa Cruz County.
To the House of Repre-pnta
tives, the Senate and the Piesi
dent of the United States:
Your Memorialist, the Third
State Legislature, in Special
War Session, of Arizona, re
spectfully set forth
It is now known that this '
world can no longer remain half
Autocratic and have Democratic.
Every child of freedom the world
around is conscious of that fact,
most certainly are they, within
the folds of the Stars and Stripes
Yet knowing it, we have not
fully met the issue involved.
Autocracy sneeringly holds it
self to have the advantage be
cause it is able by the single
word of the Autocrat to wield
the body, mind and soul of its
subjects into one great irresis
tible force. While a Democracy
endeavoring to crystalize itself
through a President and Con
gress subserviant to the will ot
a nation of independent minds
will fail utterly in the final test.
If this be so, then the struggle
of humanity through the ages is
lost. If Autocracy wins on the
fields of Prance there will be no
human conscience left to dispute
its kultur.
Can this be averted? Arizona
believes it can if these United
States will, through efforts that
move with order, determination
and precision, organize all its
resources, material, spiritual and
psychological, and throw them
all quickly into the conflict.
In your deliberations on a new
revenue bill it will be well to re
member tiiat the Government
has conscribed all its fighting
forces, but it has not yet taken
full measure of its supporting
forces. The one way to accom
plish the latter is for everyone,
men and women, for the dura
tion of the war, to give to his
country : his entire time, effort
and earnings, consistent with a
healthy existence.
Therefore the Legislature of
Arizona suggests that you call
for all citizens to volunteer in
the service of their country in
the positions they now occupy,
or in others, as the country
might wish, and after a reason
able period to draft all slackers
and misfits; that co incident with
this call for a whole hearted re
sponse by the people you give
that response expression, assur
ance and confidence in a tax that
will take all the net earnings of
the people over and above what
is needed to support the indus
tries and a normal and healthy
existence.
It is true that such a thing has
never been done before, but De
mocracy has never been chal
lenged before as it is at this
hour. We believe the lives of
our young men, on the threshold
of responsibility, are as valuable
to the nation as a few short
years of consecrated effort on
the part of the rest of us who
will soon pass out. Certainly a
few years given to our country
in the security maintained by
our magnificent youth cannot be
compared with the sacrifices,
heroism and patriotism they of
fer their country.
This is a country, not of blood
or of an idea, but it is an ideal,
and as such it must live on
ideals. The nobler the ideal that
supports it, the more potent it
becomes both within and with
out its confines. Complete ser
vice to our country is indeed one
hundred per cent Americanism
and nothing short of it is. Such
a service would burn all the
sordid in our makeup, as a peo
ple, to a white ash. It would
dissolve all the problems of
class. It would exalt us to an
efficiency not yet recorded in
history. It would reveal to us
the true meaning of Democracy,
not because we thought it but
because we lived it. It would
clarify our vision so that we
could point the way to a lasting
peace.
Such a service would inspire
our armies as no armies were
ever inspired before. It would
make each soldier conscious that
his country had not forgotten
him but was behind him in all
its intensity and that if he died
bis country-men would live for
the same thing for which he
died. It would make him feel
that a nation that could show
such spiritual heroism must in
deed be the revelation of the
Divine Plan of the Ages and
that to give his all for it would
be a privilege sweeter than ever
tasted by mortal.
Such a service would convince
Autocracy that Democracy was
more potent than any other
earthly force. It would convince
all mankind that Democracy was
a living, vital thing that could
be comprehended, practiced and
sustained. It would teach man
kind that we strove for the race
and not for ourselves alone. Its
psychological effect would be
more powerful than all the ar
mies Autocracy could muster.
The blood of our soldier boys
calls for nothing short of this,
our conscious mission before
God and man demands nothing
less. We know what justice is.
In this supreme test, if we do
not do our utmost, we shall
prove unworthy of justice and
the debasement and butchery of
the Hun may be our just reward.
It is ordered that a copy of
this Memorial be transmitted to
the Governor of Arizona, to the
President of the United States,
to the Speaker of the House of
Representatives, the President
of the Senate, and Arizona's de
legation in Congress, the Hon.
M. A. Smith, Hon. Henry P.
Ashurst and Hon. Carl Hayden.

ASSAYER ACCIOENTLY KILLED.
Sidney D. Kempton, of the
firm of Kempton & O'Neill, local
assayers and chemists, was in
stantly killed last Monday fore
noon, by the explosion of a gas
oline tank, at the laboratory of
the firm, in the rear of the In
ternational Drug Store.
Peter Schultz, assistant assay
er, was painfully but not fatally
injured by the explosion, which
badly wrecked the room in which
Mr. Kempton was soldering the
tank, which had been leaking.
It is said that Mr. Schultz warn
ed Mr. Kempton of the danger.
When the torch which was be
ing used to melt the solder, was
brought near the tank, the gas
inside ignited, blowing the tank
to pieces, some of which struck
Mr. Kempton on the head with
such terrible force, he was in
stantly killed.
Schultz was immediatelly rush
ed to the St. Joseph's hospital,
where it was found his injurious
were not as serious as at first
believed.
The funeral of the victim of
the terrible accident, was held
Tuesday afternoon, from the
family residence on Washington
street, under the auspices of the
Nogales lodge, Loyal Order of
Moose, of which deceased was a
member. Interment was in the
Nogales cemetery.
The deceased, who for more
than a quarter of a century, en
gaged in the business of assay
ing and chemistry, in Arizona
and Mexico, was highly respect
ed by all who knew him. Ha
leaves a wife and two children,
who reside here, and a mother
and sister in Canada.
Besides the assay business,
Mr. Kempton owned an interest
in a wonderfully rich tungsten
mine in the Dcquesne district,
this county, which gave promise
of making himself and associates
big monrj'.
His sudden, tragic death is
deeply regretted by a wide circle
of friends and acquaintances.

After a Few Doses of Black-Draught,
Meadorsvllle, Ky. Mrs. Cynthia
Hig-ginbotham, of this town, says: "At
my age, which Is 65, the liver does
not act so well as when young. A few
years ago, my stomach was all out of
fix. I was constipated, my liv-r
didn't act. My digestion was bad, and
It took so little to upset me. My ap
petite was gone. I was very weak...
I decided I would give Black
Draught a thorough trial as I knew it
was highly recommended for tlii3
trouble. I began taking it. I felt
better after a few doses. My appetite
Improved and, I became stronger. My
bowels acted naturally and the least
doses of Black-Draught."
Seventy years of successful use has
made Thedford's Black-Draught a
standard, household remedy. Every
member, of every family, at times,
need the help that Black-Draught can
give in cleansing tho system and re
lieving the troubles that come from
constipation, indigestion, lasy liver,
etc. You cannot keep well unless your

working order. Keep them that way.
Try Black-Draught. It acts promptly,
gently end in a natural way. If you

You will feel fresh tomorrow. Price
