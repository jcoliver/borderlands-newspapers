The Spirit of Friendship.
This store looks upon its patrons not
merely as customers but as friends.
People purchase here because they
have friendly feeling for this store.
The cause which develops this friendly
feeling, may differ, iu fact, they are
sure to differ. One's friendship for
the store is the result of finding good
values; another's is the result of effi
cient service and courteous treatment,
and so on.
Naturally this friendshiply feeling on
the part of our patrons is reciprocated
on our part. And this spirit of mutual
friendship is an impetus for greater
service and an incentive to ever-increasing
endeavor to make this store
a place where every visitor will feel
perfectly at home.

Support of Governor Campbell
in anything he may undertake
to do toward ridding the state of
the I. W. W. and praise of the
governor for his stand against
radicalism were expressed in a
resolution adopted at a meeting
of the American Legion post at
Hayden, Arizona, according to
word received today from that
city. Legion members denounc
ed the killing of comrades at
Centralia, Wash.
The beekeepers of the Salt
River valley have had a pros
perous season, following organ
ization of a sales organization on
the sale plan and in co operation
with the California Honey Pro
ducers' Co-operative exchange.
Higher prices for the product
and lower prices for supplies
were thus secured. Honey is
selling for four times the price
known a few years ago. Save
for the early mesquite honey,
the local product mainly is al
falfa honey, of medium grade,

According to a report of the
Salt River Valley Water Users'
Association, just issued, the
valuation of crops under the pro
ject increased from $19,688,803
last year to $22,174,836 for the
crop year. This report is not
for the entire Salt River Valley.
It embraces only the acreage
served by the great irrigation
project, outside of it being the
Tempe, Lehi, Buckeye and other
independent canal districts, as
well as many thousands of acres,
mainly east and south of Mesa

the Arizona Live Stock Sanitary
Board, denied Tuesday that the
vote of 36 to 18 registered
against the Kenyon-Keudrick
bill at the meeting of the Ari
zona Cattle Growers' Association
at its meeting in Phoenix ten
days ago represented the senti
ment of the association as a
whole. It represented, he claim
ed, the sentiments of 35 out of
a membership of more than 1400
and he charged these 35 were
influenced by the ceaseless prop
aganda of eight packers' repre
sentatives who were present at
the meeting.

ARIZONA LAWS NOT OBSERVED,
Cotton Pickers from Mexico Fail to
Send Children to School.
A school problem with possi
ble international aspects has
been developed in the Salt River
Valley, through the importation
of thousands of cotton pickers
from northern Mexican states.
These pickers are brought in as
families, and every individual
works. Cases have been known
where a single family has earn
ed $100 a week. But the state
echool laws demand that child
ren of school age shall be in
school, and make no exception
of aliens. There also are strict
labor laws that prohibit the em
ployment of children. The labor
unions have protested against
this phase of the Valley cotton
industry, and the State Board of
Education has advised the cot
ton growers of the law's scope.
In reply, the uniform report is
that the country schools are un
able to accommodate the young
aliens affected. It has been as
serted that almost every district
schoolhouse already is filling to
overflowing, and discrimination
is manifested toward the alter
native of more bonds for new
schoolbouses and more expense
for teachers for an alien and al
most wholly illiterate class that
pays no district taxes, that
would have to be provided with
textbooks and supplies at public
expense, and that manifests
strong disinclination to being
taught. Few, if any, of the
alien children know a word of
English. They are due for re
turn to Mexico at the end of the
picking season, which happens
to come well within the school
year.
The matter has been taken up
by C. O. Case, State School Su
perintendent, who has made in
spection of a large number of
the country's rural schools. In
a number of them he is reported
to have found room for the re
ception of children of the cotton
pickers. Tucson Post.

GODSPEED TO THE LEGION.
The high hopes of the Ameri
can people for the American
Legion have been abundantly
realized at the Minneapolis con
vention. Hard fights in com
mittee and on the floor were fol
lowed by harmony on the final
line up. North, east, south and
west were represented in the
platform adopted and in the
officers elected. And, best of
all, a passionate solicitude for
the honor and welfare of the
mother of us all, America, was
shown at every step by this
band of brave defenders of the
nation who have associated them
selves together "for God and
country." In the past they
proved themselves the salvation
of America. At the present
they are hailed as the hope of
America, for from their ranks
will come the future leaders of
America for the remainder of
their day and generation.
Examination of the platform
of the legion, plank by plank,
warrants, as we believe, this
word to the Congress from
American people: "Follow
legion and you will serve
nation." Where both the
publican and Democratic parties
have failed, the legion has suc
ceeded in voicing the true senti
ments' of the "plain people of
the land." The legion's voice
those who pretend to serve the
people must heed, and that
quickly or give place to others
who will heed it.
Godspeed to the legion ! the
war's great gift to America tri
umphant. Boston Transcript.

plaints so common to
women? Then why not
give Cardui a trial? It
should surely do for you
what it has done for so
many thousands of other
women who suffered it
should help you back to
health.
Ask some lady friend
who has taken Cardui.
She will tell you how it
helped her. Try Cardui.
