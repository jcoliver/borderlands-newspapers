explained, has been granted for
a limited time to certain sections
where the supply of substitutes
had been entirely exhausted,
and will be granted under like
conditions upon application, but
in cases of this kind, it was em

per capita basis of $20.00 worth
of stamps. These stamps can
be bought a few at a time and as
$5.00 worth are bought they can
be transferred to a War Savings

In a recent letter sent out by
the Treasury Department, all
patriotic citizens- who subscrib
ed to the Liberty Loan are es
pecially warned against "agents
who have, with too frequent
success, induced subscribers to
sell their Liberty Loan bonds
and take in exchange securities
which in a number of cases have
been of very questionable value.
It is for the best interests of the
people at large, as well as for
their actual protection, that tdey
disreguard all such offers, and
hold fast to the best investment
in the world, that is, bonds of
their own government."
B. M. Atwood is state engi

and Leroy Ladd is chairman of
tbe commission of state institu
tions, succeediug Homer R.
Wood, as a result of a big shake
up in tbe statehouse this week.
The commission of state insti
tutions insisted on supervising

ly, and in addition to filing suit
against the commission, wrote a
long letter to Governor Hunt in
which he attacked Homer Wood,
Wiley Jones, attorney general,

PLENTY OF ROOM.
The people of Nogales are a

entertainers. Cattlemen who
will attend the convention of the
Arizona Cattle Growers' Asso
ciation which meets there Febru
ary 14, 15 and 16, may rest as
sured that they will be shown a
pleasant visit. We have been
asked by cattlemen over the

and eating accommodations suffi
cient for a big crowd. We have
been assured that all those things
have been attended to and every
one will be properly bedded and
fed. There is plenty of room
for all. Arizona Cattleman.
OVER TWO HUNDRED MILLION.
Output of Arizona Mines For Year
1917 Big Increase.
The output of gold, silver,
copper, lead and zinc from Ariz
ona mines in 1917, according to
Victor C. Heikes, of the United
States Geological Survey, De
partment of the Interior, had a
total value of over $214,000,000,
an increase of more than $23,
000,000 over the value of the
output in 1916. This increase
was due in part, however, to the
greater prices of metals, all of
which, except zinc, were decid
edly higher in 1917. In quantity
there was a marked increase in
gold, a slight increase in recov
erable zinc, but decreases in sil
ver, copper and lead. During
the early part of the year Ariz
ona was producing copper at a
rate decidedly greater than in
1916, but labor strikes at the
main producing and smelting
localities considerably reduced
the rate before tbe end of the
year. Many mills were built,
among them a custom mill at
Chloride, and a sampler at Wick -enburg.
Construction was begun
on the new smelter for the Unit
ed Verde Extension Company at
Jerome. The capacity of the
Arizona Binghamton mill was
increased to 250 tons a day.
The production of gold from
Arizona mines increased from
$3,985,559 in 1916 to about $-4,-831,000
in 1917. As the produc
tion of copper ore and of lead
ore were much less than in 1916,
the increase in the output of
gold can be qredited to the San
Francisco district of Mohave
county, and very largely to the
United Eastern property, which
during the year became the
largest producer of gold in the
state. The Gold Road mill was
idle and the Vulture property
was operated only a little. Pro
duction at the Tom Reed was
upheld, and considerable gold
was purchased from the Copper'
Chief mine, in the Verde district.
The mine output of silver de
creased from 7,212,039 ounces in
1916 to about 6,354,000 ounces in
1917. a decrease of about 858,000
ounces. In spite of this decrease,
the improved price of silver,
which averaged 81.4 cents an
ounce,- brought the value of the
output to about $p,000,000 an in
crease from $4,745,522 in 1916.
The decrease in quantity was
due to decreased shipments of
lead ore and copper ore.
The mine output of copper
was about 688.000,000 pounds, a
decrease of 31,000,000 pounds, or
nearly 5 per cent. Arizona is
still the leading copper mining
state and produced more than
twice as much copper as Mon
tana. The value of the output
increased from $177,570,960 in
1916 to over $200,000,000 in 1917.
Six of the large copper smelting
plants reported decreased out
puts on accountof labor troubles
Five others, however, greatly
increased their copper produc
tion the Haydes, Sasco, United
Verde, Consolidated Arizona,
the Calumet & Arizona. At the
New Cornelia property the new
leaching plant was started in
June and produced more than
2,000,444 pounds per month un
til the end of the yeer. Some
copper matte was shipped from
the Great Western smelter in
the Big Bug district. The In
ternational Smelting Company
increased its capacity by adding
a reverberatory furnace.
The mine production of lead in
Arizona decreased from 27,062,
087 pounds in 1916 to about 18,
000,000 pounds in 1917, but as
the price was better the value
was only slightly less than that
of 1916, which was $1,867,284.
Most of the lead ore came from
the Warren district, of Cochise
county, and the Walnut district,
of Mohave county. Considera
ble lead ore was shipped from
the Bunker Hill mines, in the
Tombstone district.
The output of recoverable zinc
was about 20,700,000 pounds in
1917, an increase of about a mil
lion pounds. The two largest
producers were the Union Basin
property and the Tennessee
mine, both in the Wallapai dis
trict of Mohave county. The
Arizona Hillside property at
Hillside, shipped considerable
! quantities of zinc ore for the first
time, and the properties operat
ed by Randolph & Gemmill at
Crown King also made some
shipments. 'Zinc was shipped
from the Duquesne property in
Santa Cruz county. Smaller
shipment were made from the
Wallapai district and from Tuc
son, Globe, Patagonia. Pearce
and Casa Grande. The mill of
the Union Basin property was
burned in October.
Dividends for eleven months
from Arizona properties amount
ed to more than $41,000,000.

ELECT LOYAL MEN TO OFFICE.
The people of the United
States have as important duty
to perform this year as the win
ning of the war, and that is to
see that only loyal Americans
are placed in office to keep the
war going and to force the issue
with the kaiser to a successful
determination. One hundred per
cent Americans are needed. Do
not blind yourself with party
fealty, but see to it that if your
party tries to compromise with
the pacifists and pro Germans
that you will do your best to lay
them away in the political grave
yard. Only loyal Americans
must be put on guard in every
office, from constable to presi
dent. Messenger.
NO BETTER DEMOCRAT.
Word reaches this office that
Attorney General Wiley E. Jones
is also a candidate for the demo
cratic nomination for governor
of Arizona. There is no better
democrat anywhere and, he is
all right otherwise. The nomi
nation for this office by the de
mocratic party is the same as
handling the office to the man,
for it is his. Prescott Courier.

NOT GUILTY.
The following letter is self-
explanatory:
Tucson, Ariz., Feb. 12, 1918.
Editor The Border Vidette.
Dear Sir:
Advertisements relative to the
oil companies doing business in
the State of Arizona have been
appearing in a great many of
the newspapers of the state, the
text of which would seem to in
dicate that the Arizona State
Bureau of Mines or the Univer
sity of Arizona has placed its
approval upon some of the oil
companies selling stock. 1 his
is absolutely untrue and the use
of such advertising is positively
unauthorized, and is hereby con
demned as being deceptive and
misleading.
The Arizona State Bureau of
Mines does not in any way re
commend tbe purchase of any
oil or mining stocks, and the use
of part reports is a practice that
should be denounced by every
person in the state.
The Bureau of Mines disclaims
any knowledge of whether or
not the oil stocks on the market
today in this state are good or
bad investments.
I would thank you very much
if you would call this to the at
tention of your readers.
Yours very truly,
Charles F. Willis,
Director.

How to Avoid Quarantine Belt.
During the time that quaran
tine is on in Bisbee people from
Nogales, Huachuca mountains
or coming from Tucson and west
cannot cross at Hereford because
they will not be permitted to go
through the Warren district
when enroute to Douglas or east
ern points. The right route for
people coming from Nogales and
Huachuca mountain district is to
cross at the Charleston bridge
or the Fairbank bridge and all
people from Tucson and west
should come via. the Benson
Short Line from Vail. On ar
rival at Tombstone they may
take one of two routes for all
parts of the country. First, via.
the Cowan ranch; or, secondly,
by Gleeson, then to McNeal.
People from the east should re
verse these instructions. Gar
age men and hotel men in vari
ous towns should give out this
information and newspapers over
this district should also notify
the traveling public. Just as
soon as the quarantine is raised
on Bisbee it will be made known
and traffic can resume its reg
ular channels, but at present
many a traveler will be saved
inconvenience by having this in
formation given him. Tucson

fifty thousand artisans and me

"Whereas, the United States
Government, without this great
industrial army ready to take its
place as the need for labor
grows more urgent, cannot carry
out effectively the ship building
program on which hangs the
fate of our armies and our Allies
in Europe;
"Now Therefore, I, Geo. W.
P. Hunt, Governor of Arizona,
by virtue of the authority in me
vested, do hereby earnestly ap
peal to the known patriotism
and public spirit of the workers
of Arizona to respond as readily
as possible to the Nation's first
need, which, at this time, is the
building of ships with which to
win the war, and, consequently,
the co operation of skilled labor
in the work of ship construction.
"In thus enrolling for future
service in the Government ship
yards the workers in the differ
ent classifications of the Public
8ervice Reserve for Arizona will
be called to duty, under assur
ances received from the vice
president and general manager
of the Emergency Fleet Corpor

"In view of the foregoing, the

and the State to make such re
sponse as will enable Arizona
to furnish her just quota of men
to the United States Shipyard

GALLEB HER FAMILY
TO HER
BEDSIDE
Six Years Ago, Toinlriag She Might Die, Says Texas Lady, Bat New
She Is a Well, Strong Woman and Praises Cardui Far
Her Recovery.
Royse City. Ter.--Mrs. Mary Kil-
man, of thiB place, says; "After the
birth of my little girl. . .my side com
menced to hurt me. I had to go back
to bed. "We called the doctor. He
treated me. ..but I got no better. I
got worse and worse until the misery
was unbearable...! vaa in bed for
three months and Buffered such agony
that I was just drawn up In a knot. . .
I told my husband if he would get
me a bottle of Cardui I would trj- It. . .
I commenced taking It. however, that
v-ening I called my family about
me for I Knew I could not last
many day3 unlbss I had a change for J
the better. That was six rear ar
and I am still here and am a well,
strong woman, and I owe my life to
Cardui. I had only taken half tbe
bottle when I began to feel better.
The misery- In my side got less...
continued right on taking the Cartal
until I had taken thiee bettles and I
did not need any more for I was well
and never felt better in my life... I
have Aevtr had any trouble from that
day to this."
Do you suffer from headache, back
ache, pains in sides, or other discom
forts, each month? Or do you feel
weak, nervous and fagged-out? If so,
give Cardui, the woman's tonic, a
trial. J. 71 i
