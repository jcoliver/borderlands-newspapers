was captured on the desert on
the edge of Lost Basin last week
by an employe of a miniDg com
pany operating in the basin.
Preparatory to shipment of
ore to the Sasco Smelter, sam
ples of ore from Pinal Develop
ment will be forwarded at once
to the smelting plant in southern
Pinal county. Arrangements to
ship the first car of ore to Sasco
shortly after the first of January
are now being made.
Nine bootleggers, four at Su
perior and five at Sasco, were
taken in the dragnetoperated by
Sheriff Henry Hall this weak
and last. Eight of the nine have
already been arraigned and given
sen enees ranging from $150 fine
and ninety days to $300 fine and
?ix months in jail. Copper Camp
Colonel Harris, adjutant gen-
ral of the Arizona National
Guard, has received a wire from
Congressman Hayden stating
tl at there will be no action tak
en by congress on his . bill, to
relieve guardsmen now on the
bcrder from doing assessment
work on prospects held in their
na mes.
The worlds output of pig iron
in 1916 is estimated by the Lon
don Ironmonger as 75,973,000
tons, compared with 63,784,051
in 1915, and 62,243,164 in 1914.
The output of the United States
is estimated at 39,500,000 gross
tons. Germany 13,190,000 metric
tons. Great Britain 10,000,000
gross tons.
The supreme court in a deci
sion handed down recently rults
that the operation of the pari
mutual betting machine does not
constitute an offense under the
Arizona statutes. As a result of
this decision, it was said to be
probable that a race meeting
will be held on the fair ground
tracks during the early spring.
Ray Broken Hill will be the
next shipper from the immediate
Ray district, according to all
indieatio' s. Operations at the
property a mile south of Ray are
being pushed witrt all speed, and
as soon as the new tramway can
be installed, it is expected that
ore shipments will begin to drop
into.the cars just below the R.
and G. V. bridge.
F. B. "Bert" Aaron, former
city councilman from the Second
ward, must serve the sentence of
one j ear in jail, pay a fine of
$300, and all costs of his appeal
to the supreme court of the state.
This was decided when the su
preme court handed down a de
cision affirming the decision of
the superior court of this county
in the case against Aaron for
introducing liquor from New
Mexico into Arizona.
Automobile owners will have
to run on their old number plates
for possibly a month of the New
Year, becaus'e of the non arrival
of the new plates, according to
the secretary of state a office.
There plates were ordered last
July and the secretary says he
is a good waiter. They are now
reported to be on their way, were
reported so about a month ago.
In the meantime licenses are
being issued on paper and will
continue as long as the applica
tions and cash come in.
One of the worst storms in
years oroue over tnis county
Sunday evening. Many parties
returning from the Hackberry
celebration reported having en
countered a sandstorm so dense
that is was impossible to see the
roadway. Many were compell
ed to stop and wait for it to
clear away. The sandstorm was
followed by a heavy fall of snow.
Many places reported six to
eight inches of snow. Prom
Copperville came news of four
feetof the "beautiful." Reports
from the Lost Basin section are
to the effect that the storm to
tally wrecked the camps in that
portion of the county. All tents
were blown down and roofs blown
from frame buidings. Mohave
County Miner.
J. W. Larimore, county en
gineer,, was in town Monday on
business connected with the
roads. He says the crews are
now working on the uncomplet
ed portion of the road near the
new bridge across the Santa
Cruz liver. When this work has
been completed and the ap
proaches to the bridge made,
there remains about two and a
halt miles of work to be done on
the Washington-Duquesne road
from that point, after which the
crews will start work towards
Patagonia. Patagonian.
For the first time in several
years, the Cochise county hos
pital is filled with patients and is
refusing to receive any others,
according to the statement of Dr.
W. A. Greene, medical superin
tendent of the institution. Many
applications for admission which
have been made recently have
been refused, the doctor said,
simply because there was room
for none except the bedridden
and none else are received.
There are at this time 40 patients
in the institution and an addi
tional 40 residents in the poor
farm section.
Notices have been sent by the
Copper Queen smelter to all
customs shippers that the com
pany will refuse to accept ore
from any except those who have
contracts. The ruling further
specifies that customs shippers
who hold contracts will be held
rigidly to the amount specified
in the contract and will be al
lowed no extra tonnage. This
ruling will have the effect of
shutting off a quantity of ore
from outside sources. It is un
derstood that the company in
tends to replace this with ore
from its own mines in order to
get the full benefit of the mar
ket. Mrs. Rod Payne and daughter
of Tucson have been spending
the Christmas holidays at the
H. T. Wilson ranch in the San
Rafael valley. Mrs. Payne is
the wife of a famous newspaper
man, now foreman at the Arizona
Daily Star office in Tucson, an
old friend of Mr. Wilson. Also
at the Wilson ranch during the
holidays have been Mr. and Mrs.
J. D. Rounlree, who are over
from near Florence, whee Mr.
Rountreehas been drilling wells.
As soon as his contract is com
pleted he will return to this
county and occupy the Wilson
place, which he has rented for
the coming year. Patagonian.
D. H. Claridge, a conservative
Democrat from Graham county,
will endeavor to keep Mulford
Winsor from coming back into
controlling power as president
of the senate, by seeking that
position himself, according to
good political information in

sented his county in the senate
at the last legislature. Three
other candidates besides these
two are out for the place. They
are former Judge Fred Sutter of
Cochise county, an anti Hunt
Democrat, Mr. Rutherford of
Yavapai county, a lawyer and
radical from Jerome, and C. M.
Roberts, a cattleman of Co
chise. ARIZONA'S NEW GAME LA.W.
The new Arizona game law is
much more restrictive than the
old statute and is designed to re
stock the hills as of yore. Though
passed by the people, the meas
ure was not favored .by the Ari
zona Sportsmen's association,
which pointed out that a child
who goes hunting with his father
or who fishes on the bank for
bull heads and carp now must
pay a license fee of $1 25. The
law also protects doves and
whitewings up to July 15, permit
ting them to prey unmolested
upon" ripening grain.
Deer and wild turkey now may
be killed only in October, with a
limit of two each; ducks and
geese, October 15 to January 13;
quail, October 15 to December 31;
trout, June 1 to September 1.
A hunting license will cost
$1.25 for residents and $20 for
others, while resident fishermen
will pay $1.25 and non resident
$10.

WILL HARNESS BIG FALLS.
A Flagstaff dispatch says:
"It is proposed to utilize the
great power afforded by Mooney
Falls, of Cataract creek, for the
working of nearby mines of the
Arizona Lead & Zinc company.
It is even planned to establish
near the mines an electrolytic
reduction process, with the ne
cessary electricity general at the
falls. Within Cataract canyon
are lead-silver mines that were
worked thirty years ago, the ore
packed out of the deep gorge on
burros, but the mines lie within
the Hava Supal reservation. A
dozen years ago a company spent
several hundred thousand dol
lars in trying to utilize the pow
er of Mooney falls, 250 feet high,
the Bridal Veil falls, 144 feet,
with about 10,000 miners inches
of flow, but failed."
Employes of the Mountain
States Telephone and Telegraph
Company were made happy on
Christmas day by the receipt
from the "Corporation Different"
of a Special Christmas Bonus in
the form of three week's extra
pay with the compliments of the
company for the season. The
Christmas gift was an apprecia
tion of the work of the employes
who had been in the service the
past year, and in giving it the
big company explained that
owing to the High cost of living
at present and appreciating the
efforts of its employes for the
best interests of the public, the
special bonus was forthcoming.

Government Bureau Issues Statement
Relative to Gasoline.
In a statement recently given
out by the United States Bureau
of Standards effort is made to
correct two erroneous opinions
generally held by the public re
garding motor fuel. According
to the report, specific gravity is
practically worthless as a check
on gasoline when it is desired to
gauge its value for use in motor
cars. Just what is the proper
test is still a matter of some
doubt, aud in this regard there
port states:
"It seems most probable that
the definition of gasoline will
have to be based on the percent
age that distils over between
specified temperatures, when the
distillation is carried out under
specified conditions. This dis
tillation test, speaking in non
technical terms, is a measure of
the freedom with which the gaso
line will vaporize. The gasoline
must not vaporize too freely for
two reasons-one that it would
not be sa,'e1 and secondly, its
loss iu storage by evaporation
would be too great. Hence, the
specification may have to contain
limitations of the percentage
distilling over below a certain
temperature, coupled, perhaps,
with a proviso that certain per
centages shall distil over below
other fixed temperatures, in order
that requiste amounts of low
boiling constituents shall be
present to insure easy starting
of an engine. Likewise the
specification must contain a
provision that all must distil
over below a certain maximum
temperature in order to exclude
from the gasoline the heavier
petroleum distillates, such as
kerosene."
The report also informs the
public that it must not expect the
Bureau of Standards to take
hasty action in formulating a
gasoline test. It says:
"It is extremely important that
we proceed with the greatest
caution and in the light of the
fullest technical information.
There is only one way, or at most
a very few ways, of doing the
right thing, while there is an
infinite number of ways of doing
the wrong thing. A mistake of
any kind, such as a specification
that is unnecessarily restricted
and which might unduly limit
competition, will disturb econo
mic and manufacturing condit
ions, and might only result in
imposing greater burdens on the
consuming public.
"There are two aspects to the
question under consideration,
one local, the other national.
There is no doubt that the ad
vantages that would result from
a satisfactory standardization of
gasoline by the National Govern
ment are many. Not the least
of these would be its influence
on State and municipal legisla
tion relating to this question,
and its effect in making such
legislation more nearly uniform
throughout the country. Legis
lative bodies are beginning to
take up this question, and much
of this legislation is certain to be
ill advised, although enacted
with the best intentions, because
it can not in the nature of things
receive the careful consideration
of technical experts that is re
quired for the satisfactory salu
tion of questions of this kind. It
will readily be seen that the
effect of indiscriminate legisla
tion might produce conditions
nothing short of chaotic.
NO BETS TO BE PAID.
According to word received
from a betting commissioner in
Phoenix no bets of any kind will
be paid on the Hunt Campbell
race until the question has been
thrashed out through the courts
and one or the other is legally
declared governor of the state.
It is said that several thousands
of dollars are being held by
various people in the city of
Bisbee and it is easy to imagine
that a great many other bets
were placed throughout the
state. Should Campbell be de
clared the governor the Hunt
backers will lose more than if
Hunt should be favored at the
odds, previous to election were
greatly in favor of the incum
bent. Prospector. hc &mtcx WxtVtitt,

HENRY PLAUL KILLED.
This week a letter was receiv
ed here from Harry J. Smith,
the well known Hermosillo bank
er and ranch owner, announcing
the accidental killing of Henry
Plaul, his ranch partner, at their
ranch on the night of December
26th, by A. M. Montroy, a Hol
lander, who had been working
for Smith & Plaul since last
September, as a farm hand.
Montroy mistook Plaul for a
coyote and shot him with a rifle,
inflicting a fatal wound, which
caused his death two hours lat
er, but not before he made a
statement exonorating Montroy,
who has since been in the Her
mosillo jail, charged by the au
thorities with criminal careless
ness. If convicted, Montroy will
be sentenced to serve eight years
in jail.
Plaul, who was well and favor
ably known in Nogales, where
he was a guest at the Montezu
ma hotel several months, when
manager of the Uvalama mines
in Sonora, was buried at Hermo
sillo on December 28th.
Deceased was well liked by all
who knew him, and his sudden,
tragic death, is deeply regretted

and acquaintances, here and

PEACEFUL INVASION.
American Cowmen Permitted
Bring Cattle out of Sonora.
to
An "international roundup"
took place the lirst of the week
when 331 headJof stray cattle
belonging to American cattlemen
on the southern border of Ariz
ona, were brought, back across
the line by a party of cowmen.
Almost every year there is a
roundup of American cattle that
have strayed across the line, and
as a rule little difficulty is en
countered in getting the tjeces
sary permit to bring the cattle
across. This year much troable
was experienced, and J. M. Ron
stadt of the Ronstadt Cattle com
pauy finally enlisted the aid of
Congressman Carl Hayden and
the permit was finally issued by
the Mexicin governin3nt) L
Roca, of the Ronstadt Cattle
company, who headed the party.
Col. Camargo, a Mexican army
officer, was with the party! and
checked the cattle'and brands as
they were formally turned over
to the party of Americans.
Some had strayed as far south as
50 miles.
The bunch had been collected
for some time at the San Carlos
ranch and kept in a pasture there
Among the larger owners re
presented were the Arivaca
Land and Cattle company, Kirk
Hart, and others. About 15 ow
ners only had one or two head
of cattle in the bunch.
The partyjwasftreated with the
greatest courtesy by Mexican
cattlemen on the other side, and
it was the opinion of the visitots
that much had been done by
them to protect the American
'strays."

Arizona Has Coal Lands Galore.
In spite of the fact that there are
hundreds of square miles of un
developed coal lands in the State
of Arizona, the people in Tomb
stone, Douglas- and Bisbee are
suffering for want of the fuel.
Regarding the Arizona deposits
the Arizona Republican says:
"According to several state
officials, there is enough high
grade coal in Arizona to keep
the whole country going for a
long time. The coal is in the
state lands, and at the present
time there is no law allowing the
taking of minerals from Indian
reservations.
"Fred Nelson, prominent Apa
che county attorney, stated
yesterday afternoon that there
were 300 square miles of coal
land north of Winslow. The coal
is of the highest grade, accord
ing to Nelson. He related yes
terday that about 25 years ago,
the Santa Pe sent out to the In
dian coal fields, and brought in
enough to fill one engine tender.
The record that that engine made
on the Arizona coal was simply
amazing. In fact, after that
memorable run there was a
goodly quantity left over, which
lasted for a good many years as
a monument to unsuccessful am
bitions. It was also stated by several
northern officials that there was
a project on hand to build a
wagon road out to the coal fields
and in this manner alleviate the
threatened coal shortage in the
north.
Notice is hereby given that

execution and order of sale is

States. The omnibus bill in
cludes a bill introduced by Hon.

authorizes to be expended for
this purpose. It is expected that
this bill will pass the Senate in
the near future so that the new
Arizona hatchery should be in

Saved Girl's Life
"I want to tell you what wonderful benefit I have re
ceived from the use of Thedford's Black-Draught," writes
Mrs. Sylvania Woods, of Clifton Mills, Ky.
"It certainly has no equal for la grippe, bad colds,
liver and stomach troubles. I firmly believe Black-Draught
saved my little girl's life. When she had the measles,
they went in on her, but one good dose of Thedford's
Black-Draught made them break out, and she has had no
more trouble. I shall never be without
THEDFORD'S
in my home." For constipation, indigestion, headache, dizzi
ness, malaria, chills and fever, biliousness, and all similar
ailments, Thedford's Black-Draught has proved itself a safe,
reliable, gentle and valuable remedy.
If you suffer from any of these complaints, try Black
Draught It is a medicine of known merit Seventy-five
years of splendid success proves its value. Good for
young and old. For sale everywhere. Price 25 cents.
