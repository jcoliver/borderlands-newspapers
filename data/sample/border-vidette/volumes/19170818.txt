While less head of cattle were
shipped or driven out of Arizona
in 1916 than in 1915, according
to the report of Sam Bradner,
chairman of the Arizona live
stock sanitary board, more than
76,000 head of cattle were

The peach crop in Yuma val
ley this year is really marvel
ous, both as to yield and the
lusciousness and size of the
fruit. Every peacb tree was so
loaded with fruit it could scarce
ly stand alone, and peaches
weighing - as much as one half
pound each were not uncommon.
When this fruit was placed be
side peaches shipped into the
Yuma market there was no com
parison. Ray Lacey, who left here re
cently, sends word that be has
joined the British engineering
corps and leaves at once for
England. Mr. Lacey is well
known in Ray, where he was
employed by the Ray Con. com
pany. Should he survive the
rigors of war, the British gov
ernment will tender him a deed
to 160 acres of land either iu
Canada or Australia as soon as
he is mustered out.

AMERICA'S CAUSE FOR WAR.
"The military masters of Ger
many denied us the right to be
neutral. They filled our com
munities with vicious spies and
conspirators. They sought to
corrupt our citizens.
They sought by violence to
destroy our industries and arrest
our commerce. They tried to
incite Mexico to take up arms
against us and to draw Japan
into hostile alliance with her.
They impudently denied us the
use of the high seas and repeat

they would send to their death

MAGAZINES.
Postmaster General Burleson
has made arrangements to keep
the soldiers of the United States,
who are now in Prance, supplied
with reading matter; according
to reports that have been receiv
edby the postmaster.
In all the largest postoffices of
the country there are quantities
of literature which continually
accummulates.and heretofore trie
magazines and periodicals have
been burned as the only means
of-getiting them off the govern
ment's hands.
Since the United States has
sent its soldiers over to Prance,
the men have been demanding
English reading literature, and
henceforth the reading material
that has been collecting in the
different postoffices over the Un
ited States will be forwarded to
the soldiers free of charge.
It has been urged by the Post
master General that the citizens
of the United States help keep
up the morale and spirit of the
soldiers at the front by sending
over to Prance the magazines
and other reading articles of in
terest that would otherwise be
destroyed.
The amount that it requires to
send a magazine to Prance un
der these conditions is one cent.
No name or address is necessary
The government will see that
the magazines get to Prance and
into the hands of Uncle Sam's
boys.
Rains Have Helped the Cotton.
Prom all sections of the valley
the conditions of growing cotton
is more favorable since rains of
the past two weeks. While there
has been plenty of water for
irrigation, cotton, like corn,
seetas to feed water betting at
boiling time with rain that fills
up and moistens the stalk.
First signs of ripening are in
evidence and by one more month
much of the cotton will be ready
to pick.
There has been some uneasi
ness about labor for picking but
those who keep informed are of
the opinion sufficient Indians
and Mexicans, the latter tem
porarily on this side of the bor
der, will be available.
While there has been much
talk of only paying 21 cents a
pound for picking cotton, it is
not probable there will be a fix
ed price as some of the better
fields can be picked cheaper
than where the crop is lighter.
It is thought one half bale to
the acre will be about the aver
age yield of the long staple
Egyptian cotton, the kind that
is grown here. The price of
cotton, many think, will be
about 75 cents a pound.
Picking and ginning the cot
ton from 35,000 acres will fur
nish a good -deal of work and the
product is estimated at from
$6,000,000 to $10,000,000, owing
to the price and way the crop
matures. The Messenger.
Tucson Slacker Has Every Wish.
When the youth of Pima coun
ty was called to register. Wm.
M. Weitzel, husky brakeman of
the Southern Pacific, was report
ed to have said he would like to
see them force him to register.
When the draft was made, he
was reported to have said, he
would like to see them draft
him. In fact, according to some
people in town, Weitzel would
like to see a lot of things hap
pen to him. Among them he
would like to see any United
States marshal arrest him.
When Weitzel finished his trip
from Lordsburg about 9:30 last
night, a tall rather tired look
ing middle aged man approach
ed him, as Weitzel started to hit
out for a wash up.
"Isnt your name Weitzel?" he
asked friendly like.
"Yes,"," said Weitzel, "Why ?"
"Why," said the stranger, "we
want you."
Thus everything happened to
Weitzel that according to his
friends, he had wished. Yet, in
the county jail where he was
taken charged with being a
slacker by Deputy United States
Marshal Treahy, he was unhap
py last night. Tucson Citizen.
NO MORE HONOR PRISONERS
The honor system at the Ariz
ona state prison has been abol
ished and trustworthy prisoners
will hereafter be required to
serve their full time within the
prison walls unless action is
taken by the state board of
paroles and pardons.
The abolishment of the honor
system came as a result of a
communication from Attorney
General Wiley E. Jones, ad
dressed to Superintendent An
derson of the prison, in which
the former stated that honor pri
soners were enjoying freedom
illegally and that action must be
taken immediately to return the
same. "Unless you follow these
instructions I can and will start
mandamus proceedings to return
these men," the communication
stated.
On being notified of the attor
ney general's act, Gov. Thomas
E. Campbell gave instructions
to call in all honor prisoners,
many of whom had enjoyed
comparative freedom for many
months.
At the time these orders were
issued, there were 23 honor pri
soners, 19 of whom had been re
leased by former Warden Sims
and four of whom are enjoying
liberty as a result of the efforts
of present Superintendent Anderson.
THE COUNTRY'S HONOR.
The large number of subscrib
ers, more than four million, and
the large amount subscribed,
over three billion dollars, to the
Liberty Loan was a splendid de
monstration of the worth of a
good name. For generations the
United States government bond
has been a synonym for absolute
security, because the honor of
our country is behind it. "As
good as a government bond,"
was as common a term as "As
good as gold," in speaking of
securities or investments.
The United States has reaped
the reward from its own people
for never having defaulted on
an obligation. "Our sacred hon
or" is no idle pharse in the Un
ited States. The tradition of
our national honor began in
Washington's day when in his
first inaugural address he said,
"The foundations of our nation
al defense will be laid in the
pure and immutable principles
of morality," and it has been
preserved through all our his
tory. The honor of the United States
is back of the Liberty Loan
bonds and all America and all
the world know that they are
absolutely safe.
Of Interest to Fruit Shippers.
The state department of
weights and measures has sent
out a circular letter, as follows,
affecting city dealers, dealers
and shippers of fruits and vege
tables: "On November 1, 1916, a law
goes into effect in the United
States which is important to all
dealers handling fruits and ve
getables for interstate shipments
from Arizona points.
"The Act fixes the capacities
and dimensions of three sizes of
Climax baskets only. The effect
of this is to prohibit the use in
interstate commerce of Climax
baskets of all other sizes.
"Package manufacturers and
dealers, fruit and vegetables
growers, and shippers or deal
ers in any of these products may
forward containers, charges pre
paid, to the Bureau of Markets.
Washington, D. C, for examin
ation and testing, in order to
determine for the information of
the sender whether such con
tainer manufactured, bought,
sold or used by him complies
with the provisions of this aot.
"As interstate shipments of
fruits and vegetables from Ariz
ona points is increasing, it will
be well for handlers to have any
baskets tested that are intended
for use after November 1, 1917.

SANTA CRUZ COUNTY FAIR.
The board of directors of the
Santa Cruz County Fair associa
tion, has completed the pre
mium list lor the approaching
county exhibition in October,
and with the funds available
they have been able to offer a
very attractive list, which will
assure the most complete dis
play of exhibits presented yet.
In the most important classes
the first premiums are set at
$50, with the seconds at $25. All
others are on the same basis as
the premiums offered by the
state fair. Improvements in the
grounds and enlargement of
buildings to give space to much
greater an array of exhibits
have been provided.
Mr. W. F. Neill of Vaughn,
has been made manager of the
fair, and from this time forward
until a successful exhibition has
been pulled off he will give the
business his undivided attention.

Blackleg Causes Heavy Cattle Losses.
Blackleg has caused more los
ses among cattle in Arizona than
any other one disease. It is ex
tremely prevalent througboutall
parts of the state. The United
States department of agriculture
states that 20 per cent of the
losses in cattle in the western
states is due to black leg. This
means an annual loss of over
half a million dollars and about
15,000 head of stock annually
from black leg alone in Arizona.
These figures are apparently
much too low, for it is certain
that each year during the past
five years there have died more
than 30,000 cattle annually in
Arizona due to black leg, and
the loss amounts to fully $1,000,
000 yearly. In certain herds
losses have been especially high,
amounting to as much as 20 per
cent of the young stock. Since
this disease may be almost en
tirely prevented with little out
lay of expense or labor, it is im
portant that cattlemen become
familiar with the nature of the
disease and how to prevent loss.
Draft Quotas for Arizona Increased.
A dispatch from Phoenix
states that Arizona's draft quotas
by counties, as reapportioned by
order of the War Department,
are based on the number of citi
zens registered for selective
draft in each county, instead of
both citizens and aliens.
The quota of Apache county
was increased from 42 to 55;
Cochise from 664 to 674, Graham
from 66 to 114; Maricopa from
386 to 598; Mohave from 81 to
111; Navajo from 77 to 99; Pima
from 2S5 to 291; Yavaoai from
397 to 423 and Yuma from 90 to
124.
The following quotas were re
duced: Coconino from 59 to 54;
Gila ftom 562 to 518; Greenlee
from 344 to 161; Pinal 'from 310
to 155; Santa Cruz from 109 to

BEDSIDE
Six Years Ago, Thinking She Might Die, Says Texas Lady, Bat No.?
She Is a Well, Strong Woman and Praises Cardui For
Her Recovery.
Royse City, Ter. Mrs. Mary Kil
man, of this place, says; "After the
birth of my little girl... my side com
menced to hurt me. I had to go back
to bed. "We called the doctor. He
treated me but I got no better. I
got worse and worse until the misery
was unbearable. . .1 was in, bed for
three months and suffered such agony
that I was just drawn up In a knot. . .
I told my husband If he would get
me a bottle of Cardui I would try it. . .
I commenced taking it, however, that
avening I called my family about
me for I knew I could not last
many days unress I had a change for
the better. That was six years ago
and I am still here and am a well,
strong woman, and I owe my life to
Cardui. I had only taken half tha
bottle when I began to feel better.
The misery in my side got les3... I
continued right on taking the Cardui
until I had taken thiee bottles and I
did not need any more for I was well
and never felt better in my life. . . I
have never had any trouble from that
day to this."
Do you suffer from headache, back
ache, pains in sides, or other discom
forts, each month? Or do you feel
weak, nervous and fagged-out? If eo,
give Cardui, the woman's tonic, a
trial. J. 71
