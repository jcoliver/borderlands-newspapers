Miss C. Louise Boehiinger.
ex-county superintendent of
schools in Yuma county, has
purchased tne Arizona Teacher
of Prof. Colodny, and will at
once assume complete charge,
issuing the publication in the
future at Phoenix. The first
number of the Teacher under
her editorship will be issued the
last of September.
Attorney General Wiley Jones
announced this week that he
had appointed W. Paul Geary,
former chairman of the Arizona
corporation commission, to suc
ceed R. William Kramer as as
sistant attorney general. Geary
will have charge of the legal
work for the corporation com
mission. Kramer has resigned
to become associated with the
Phoenix law firm of Armstrong
& Lewis.
The railroads of. the country
are preparing to throw them'
selves again in back of the Lib
erty Loan when the second issue
of bonds goes on sale. Local
railroad officials have received
word that striking posters call
ing upon railroad men to rally
to the cause would soon be is
sued by the railroads' war board
and displayed in every railroad
station, shop and terminal plant
in the country.
Barometer of patriotism is
rising rapidly throughout the
United Sta s. There will be
few families that have not loved
ones gone to the war, either of
the rich or poor. The natural
result must be that minor eco
nomic differences will give way
to public welfare. There are but
two sides of the war question
and one of these is right. Those
who are not with the govern
ment are against it. There can
be no such thing as a neutral
American. Any country that is
good enough to live in is also
good enough to tight for. There
must be no traitors in camp.
The Cochise-Graham Cattle
Growers' Association has passed
resolutions of commendation on
the work of State Land Comnsis-
S'oner W. A. Moeur, in connec
tion with the operation of a law
that allows leasing of State
lands for grazing purposes. It
was asked that the leasing law
be extended to permit the ac
quirement by single individuals
of not more than 6400 acres of
land for grazing purposes, the
present limitation of 60 acres
being to small. It was urged
that the 6,000,000 acres of land
still in possession of the State
best can be made useful through
such an extension of the leasing
maximum.
Another mine of the Tucson
district was placed in the pro
ducing class this week, when
the Mile Wide Copper Company,
which last week signed a con
tract with the Sasco smelter,
began shipping. For the last
six months the ore has been
-piling on the dump at the mine
awaiting a contract. Prom now
on it is planned to ship four car
loads of ore per week. Accord
ing to C. P. Reineger, the ore
which is being shipped will
average around 8 per cent, be
ing mixed and unassorted cop
per carrying a high percentage
of iron. The ore proved attrac
tive on assay to the Sasco smelt
er by reason of the iron contests
as well as the copper.
C. W. Ingham yesterday re
ceived a letter from his son,
Donald, who is at Fort Riley
with the first increment of Yuma
county boys who are preparing
to go to France, in which the
boy stated that the spirit of the
Yuma contingent was good and
all are well and happy. Donald
returned his grip and all his
clothing, including shoes, stat
ing that the boys were provided
with new uniforms throughout.
Since arriving at Camp Funston
they boys have been vaccinated
twice, once against smallpox and
once against typhoid fever. The
letter states that according to
the present schedule the boys at
that cantonment will depart for
France some time the latter part
of December. --Yuma Sun.
Now that more than a million
men are bearing arms aside from
those called under the selective
draft and the latter so chosen
are taking there places for train
ing at the big cantonments,
nearly every family in this broad
land has one or more loved ones
wearing the colors and prepar
ing to fight the Nation's battles.
From every hamlet, village,
town and school district, the
boys have been summoned. They
have responded nobly and in
most instances without murmur.
All this has brought home to
us that we are in war and that
it is not the president's quarrel
neither is it the rich man's fight
but it'is a titanic struggle that
includes every man, woman and
child in the United States.
All are not on the fighting
line, of course, but the chosen
soldiers have gone forward un
der the uniform system of rais
ing an army.
There is a duty for all who
have been left behind. They
must keep the fires of patriotism
burning, provide food, clothing
and supplies for our army, also
that of our allies who fight with
us in a common cause.
It is too late to discuss why
we are at war or whether there
might have been some other
way. Suffice to say that congress
and the president have spoken
and the decision made by them
is binding on all.
Every sign of disloyalty should
now be rebuked and the people
as one must labor, save and
strive to achieve victory.
Possibly peace may come as
suddenly as the war begun.
That is the hope of every true
American. All will be glad if
our boys are not called upon to
enter the trenches and do deeds
of valor that costs human lives.
It is highly probable the war
will not last long because Ger
many can not resist for long
against the battling forces of
the civilized world. But until
victory is achieved and the ene
my has lain down the arms of
warfare or a satisfactory peace
has been concluded there is but
one thought that should fill the
mind of each and every citizen :
What can I do to help win the
war?
As seriousness of the situation
dawns or our people, capitalists
will pay fair wages, labor troub
les will cease and there wiH be
an invincible America. Mes
senger. CUSTOM SMELTER NEEDED.
Bar silver has reached the
highest price this generation
has known. It is soaring four
and five points above $1.00 an
ounce, a figure that seems al
most inconceivable. Other ores
are at nearly as high prices in
comparison. On every side of
Douglas there is ore of various
kinds that could be mined pro
fitably were it so that reduction
facilities could be obtained. The
big smelters here have all they
can do to take care of the ore
from the mines of the companies
that own them. The custom
smelter at El Paso is too far
away to give satisfactory ser
vice, and there is no other one
within reach of this section.
The need and the opportunity
for a custom smelter in Douglas
are plain. It would pay from
the start. Why not boost for
one until the hope becomes a
realization? Douglas Dispatch.
PEERLESS ENGINEERS FAVOR
ASPHALT-BASE OIL.
Further recognition for motor
oil made from California asphalt
base petroleum was brought to
light recently when a prominent
Peerless dealer showed a group
of newspaper men a letter from
the Peerless factory.
This letter stated that after
testing several kinds of oil, the
technical department was able
to secure uniformly better re
sults with a certain widely
known advertised motor oil made
here on the Pacific Coast from
California asphalt base petro
leum, than from any of the oils
which they tested.
This Year It Will Be Bigger and Better.
Than Ever. 0
The State Fair should be, and
will be, bigger and better this
year than ever before. This is
not gush as there are good re
asons for the statement. Never
before has a nation's need been
in such complete harmony with
all the purposes for which State
Expositions are created. Never
before have all interests in the
State seemed to cooperate so
willingly toward the success of
the Fair. And not for three or
four years past, have the people
of the State been so well able to
attend the Fair.
Rising to the occasion the Fair
Commission seeks foi commen
surate expansion in every de
partment. The premiums in all
departments are more liberal
than ever before. New classes
are added and new features dis
played. The harness races will
call for not less than $27,000,
w,hich is $15,000 more than was
offered last year. Of this sum
credit should be given to the
mining companies which have
stood the guarantee Of $10,000.
The running races are propor
tionately provided for. In the
neighborhood of $25,000-goes to
premiums on general exhibits.
A new mining building is under
construction and plans are laid
to make this feature a "live"
one instead of a "dead" exhibit.
The big mines have always had
fine exhibits. This year they
will be increased and new feat
ures added. A moving picture
will give a continuous perform
ance in the mineral building
not confined to one thing but to
a variety of reels. There will
also be lectures on ore determin
ations, first aid, safety first and
demonstrations of the use of the
gas helmet.
The live "stock departments
will be better represented than
before. Superintendent Van Kirk
says he expects 500 animals in
his "cow" department. All the
horses not sent to France are in
vited to be present.
And there are more and better
babies in Arizona than every be
fore. Lots of them will be on
exhibition.
The departments under the
direction of the women will be
given more room and better
facilities than ever before, and
the Fair grounds are already
"littered up" with busy women.
All this means that the Fair
organization having planned big
things, expects big support. The
date is November 12 17. Get
your traveling bag ready.
PLANT WINTER WHEAT.
Arizona is capable of increas
ing her winter wheat acreage.
Under the government guaran
tee of $2.20 per bushel at ter
minal points, Arizona winter
wheat planting will undoubtedly
he increased.
The Government desires to
raise the nation's wheat crop in
1918 to one billion bushels. To
bring this about it is estimated
that the acreage to be planted
to fall wheat should reach 47
million acres. The average yield
of winter wheat for the United
States is 15.6 ' bushels, with a
yield of 13.2 bushels for spring
wheat.
Arizona's quota to bring about
the desired increase is 43,000
acres, which is an increase of 16
per cent over last year. In spite
of the fact that cotton will claim
a considerable acreage of land
in the Salt River Valley which
would otherwise be planted to
winter wheat, the desired 15 per
cent increase for the state in
wheat is expected.
Pit silos if properly construct
ed will last indefinitely in the
Great Plains region, and silage
is kept as well as in the above
ground types, specialists of the
United States Department of
Agrioulture say. As a guide to
those who wish to build pit silos,
a new publication of the Depart
ment of Agriculture, Farmers'
Bulletin 825, "Pit Silos," gives
the details of construction and
drawing that make them easily
workable.
The U boat peril has ceased to
give serious concern. It will
doubtless remain a plague while
the war lasts; but the govern
ment is confident of being able
to hold it within limits. We
shall, be able to send men and
materials across the sea without
fatal hinderance.
Only one American steamship
out of 200 has been sunk by a
submarine since we entered the
war. In no case have the Ger
mans succeeded in sinking a big
or fast ship. They have merely
picked off a few slow tankers
and freighters.
This good showing is due to
the effective means found for
fighting the sea pirates. Im
proved methods have been in
volved and new devices invent
ed. Nets to ensnare the unwary
submarine, mounted guns on
merchantmen, smoke-boxes to
hide a menaced ship, depth
bombs that explode under water,
swarms of sea planes and de
stroyers patrolling the steamer
lanes all these have had their
effect. And now there are hints
of a marvelous invention that
will reveal the presence and loca
tion of any U-boat and thus
facilitate its destruction.
Meanwhile our ship supply is
increasing enormously. We have
seized and utilized about 100
German vessels. The govern
ment has commandeered 2,000, -0C0
tons of shipping in process
of construction. Contracts have
been signed or soon will Design
ed, for ships aggregating 8,000,
000 tons more. We shall have
in a year or so, ten times as
many ships in the foreign trade
as we had three years ago.
There is no need to worry.
We're going to make a bridge of
ships across the Atlantic. EI

POTATOES SAVE WHEAT.
Americans, if they would think
of the' humble potato as a
"breadstuff" rather than merely
as a "vegetable," would find
that they could spare much
bread from their diet without in
convenience, the dietetic special
ists of the United States Depart
ment of Agriculture point out.
The potato Irish or sweet
differs from almost all other
common vegetables in that it
supplies important amounts of
starch, and starch is the chief
food element we get from bread.
Green vegetables, with which
potatoes often are classed, sup
ply little or no starch and en
ergy, and are valuable in the
diet principally for the mineral
substances and acids they sup
ply and for giviag bulk to the
diet. Potatoes, of course, sup
ply valuable mineral substances
useful in the building up, repair,
and regulation of the body, but
they have won their great place
in the diet of a large part of the
world because they supply starch
which otherwise would have to
be obtained from cereals. E. D. MILLER. Editor and Prop.

PASTOR CALLED TO COLORS.
Rev. Father Van Goethen Will Leave
for Battle Line in France.
Rev. Father G. Van Goethen,
pastor of the Sacred Heart
Church, has been called to
France as a chaplain in the ser
vice of the allies and will leave
for New York within a few days,
says Monday's Herald. Rev. N.
J. Lavelle, pastor of St. Pa
trick's Cathedral of New York
who is in charge of the work of
sending Catholic priests to the
war zone, wired Father Van
Goethen to be ready for a call
within a week. The National
Catholic War Council has found
it necessary to send a number of
priests to the front and Father
Van Goethen will be in the first
increment, to go across the pond.
When seen this morning Fath
er Van Goethen was very happy
over the prospects of getting to
the front line trenches. His
aged mother lives at the village
of Lokeren between Ghent and
Antwerp where the west line is
being pushed back at the pre
sent time.
"Wno knows, I may be able to
have dinner with my mother and
then go out on the lines and see
the boys battle in the afternoon,"
said Father Van Goethen. Dur
ing the three years that he has
been in Nogales, Father Van
Goethen has made a world of
friends not only among those of
his church but the public in
general. Father Van Goethen
comes of a prominent Belgian
family and those who have been
in close touch with him know
what an extreme pleasure it will
be for him to go to the battle
front and help the boys on the
line push forward so that he
might again be among those
that are near and dear to him.
While the people of Nogales
will regret to lose Father Van
Goethen and will miss his charm
ing personality, they wish him
every success and will pray that
he will safely reach the land for
which his heart has bled, during
the past three years.
Hon. Fred. T. Colter, the big
northern Arizona cattleman has
been in Phoenix for more than a
week attending to business in
the land office and before the
land commission. Mr. Colter has
thousands of acres of patented
and leased lands in Apache coun
ty, where he runs cattle and
also farms over 2000 acres.

Chevrons for First Increment.
The entire contingent of five
per cent now at Camp Punston,
Port Riley which numbers 2,250
men, is being made corporals,
sergeants and lieutenants as fast
as the instructors can do so. ac
cording to word received from
that camp where the Arizona
boys have been sent.
That this is the intention is
evident, it is said, from the man
ner in which recruits are being
rounded into trained men with
the least loss of time. Men from
-the regular army have been sent
to Camp Punston and these have
been plaeed in every squad of
recruits on either side of the
new men, and in this manner
they explain each order and aid
in executing it. With this sort
of drilling it is expected that the
new men will be well up in tac
tics in a short time and be pre
pared to do some drill coaching
themselves when the next con
tingent arrives at the camp.
This explains the delay, it is
said in assigning the new men
to companies and regiments.
By drilling in squads and pla
toons with the aid of the regular
army men the five per cent will
not be ; 'rookies" in a few weeks,
but will be ready to wear the
chevrons of a corporal or ser
geant and take command of a
squad when the forty per cent
arrives. Blade-Tribune.
