Pima extra No. 1 long staple
cotton sold this week at the
Tempe cotton exchange for SO
cents per pound, a new record.
The tendency continues upward
and the cotton crop from 34,000
acres in Salt River valley this
year will exceed 5,000,000 in
value.
The government of the United
States proposes to rent the rifle
range north of Prescott for graz
ing purposes. There is 1,760
acres of it. It grows some grass
and like most of the land around
here, would grow a variety of
fine crops if under irrigation. f

as she was fresh in January.

The date crop in the Salt
River valley is unusually heavy
this year. It has not been in-,
jured by rain, as was the case
last year in the fruiting season.
The fruit now is grown in aTl
parts of the valley and the in
dustry has been very successful,
with a more general knowledge
of the manner of pollenation.
The United States Department
of Agriculture urges buyers of
baled hay to make certain that
they do not buy veneered or
faced bales as high-grade hay.
Veneered bales contain high
grade hay on the outside while
the center is packed with cheap
er grades. The National Hay
association is opposed to the
practice, and has asked the de
partment to assist in eliminat
ing it.
The permission given by the
Mexican government for unre
stricted shipments of potatoes
has so far failed to bring the
price of this food article any
lower than it was before the ban
was lifted. There are plenty of
potatoes in the Pronteras dis
trict and they are cheap enough
on the ground, but by the time
they reach Douglas the cost
mounts up to a figure hat gives
small comfort to the consumer.
The recent frosts have worked
havoc with unmatured cotton
bolls in some sections of the
valley. The growers have no
cause for complaint however.
Already they have sufficient
matured cotton to make this
year's crop the most profitable
one ever produced in the Salt
river valley. Several days ago
a few bales of the best grade of
cotton brought close to seventy
six cents a pound, and a still
higher figure is predicted. - Tem

Holders of mineral properties
who desire to take advantage of
the recent resolution of congress
to the effect that assessment
work will be suspended during
the period of the war, are warn
ed that they must fill out a "No
tice of Intention to Hold Mining
Claims," and file it with the
County Recorder before the first
of January. This applies to all
claims filed with Recorders. No
tices regarding claims in other
counties must be filed with the
County Recorder of the county
in which the properties lie.
R. G. Brady has bought the
old Inter-Ocean ranch in the
Catalina mountains from Tom
Wills and associates and will
stock it with cattle. This range
joins Mr. Brady's "Three C"
ranch on the south and will be a
very valuable addition to Mr.
Brady's range. In fact it will
make him the best ranch in
Southern Arizona. There is
plenty of water and feed on this
range and it will carry several
thousand cattle the year round.

At the Trench mine at Har
shaw, in charge of John Hoy,
there is considerable activity at
present. The new machinery
lately delivered has been install
ed, and a 40 foot gallows frame
has been erected over the shaft,
which is now down 400 feet.
The shaft will be sunk at least
200 feet deeper, although the
equipment is capable of sinking
to a depth of 1600 feet. The
mine gives promise of early re
turns on the capital now being
invested. Patagonian.
The State Council of Defense
has figures showing that Ariz
ona this year will crop 1800
acres of beans, most of them of
the pink and brown varieties,
which can be grown successfully
in the medium or lower altitudes
where the soil is light and where
there is an ample water supply.
This production means 72 pounds
for every man, woman and child
in Arizona, if the crop be esti
mated at only 1000 pounds to the
acre. Naturally there will be a
very large surplus left for ship
ping or for military uses, Ari
zona thus contributing another
"bit" for the war.
Two stockmen from southern
Grant county are preparing to
ship their cattle into better
range in Arizona. James Parks
of Duncan will send his stock to
some pasture land be has leased
near Tucson. Dan Olney of
Steins will ship his cattle to a
point southwest of Tucson where
he has obtained a state lease of
a large tract of excellent graz
ing land. Other cattlemen are
making arrangements to ship
out of the country during the
drought while some are prepar
ing to make a harvest of soap

Specimens of Ore Sent to State Fair
To Col. R. R. Richardson is
due most of the credit for the
mineral display from this dis
trict at the permanent $30,000
mines building at Phoenix, he
having gone to consideiable
trouble and expense to secure
some extra fine specimens from
some of the properties in which
he is interested and having them
sent to the mines building.
Among the specimens furnish
ed by Colonel Richardson . were
the following: One from the
Hardshell mine, two from the
3 R, one from the Flux, three
from the Josephine Canyon
group, one from the Arizona
European. Mr. John Hoy gave a very fine
specimen of high grade silver
copper ore from the Trench
mine.
Mr. Prank Powers of the
World's Pair was not on his
property when a representative
of the Nogales chamber of com
merce called, so a specimen from
that famous mine was not secur
ed for the state fair exhibit, but
Mr. Powers assured him that a
sample would be placed in the
permanent display.
Owners of mines should em
brace the opportunity offered by
the state bureau of mines to ad
vertise their properties by plac
ing specimens from them on dis
play in the new building. The
mineral wealth of Santa Cruz
county is one of importance, and
at this time, when the prices of
metals are high and there is a
great demand for them for use
in the manufacture of war muni
tions, every effort should be
made to bring to the attention of
the men interested in the pro
duction of metals that Santa
Cruz county is one of the richest
mineral fields in the world, and
needs only the capital necessary
to mine at depth to prove that
this is no idle boast. Patagonian.
PASSPORTS ISSUED BY COUR1S
Superior Courts Given Jurisdiction
Except in Pima and Maricopa.
All superior courts excepting
those of Maricopa and Pima
county have jurisdiction over
and can issue passports, it was
said at the office of the clerk of
the federal court yesterday.
tn Pima county and Maricopa
counties, passports are issued at
the federal court clerk's office
only, it was said definitely.
There had been some doubt as
to the issuance of passports
there.
All native-born citizens of the
United States wishing passports
must go to the office of the clerk
of the court for passports and
bring with them their birth cer
tificate and three copies of their
photograph, three by three
inches in size.
Those who are not native-born,
but are naturalized citizens, must
bring three copies of their pho
tograph, and their naturalization
papers.
These regulations are general
throughout the state, whether
apolication is made to county or
federal courts. By the granting
of jurisdiction to county superior
courts, it is expected that con
siderable delay and expense will
be saved to those desiring pass
ports, for they can apply to the
nearest court, except in Mari
copa and Prma county. In these
counties they must apply to the
federal court at Tucson or at
Phoenix. Star.
FREE FOR ALU RACE.
W. A. Moeur, commissioner of
the state land department has
entered the gubernatorial race
in earnest, having been a re
ceptive candidate for some time.
He is well qualified and if nom
inated, will run like a race
horse. With Sidney P. Osborn,
secretary of state, also in the
running, it will divide the vote of
Maricopa county very nearly
equally between the two with
the result favorable to an out
side candidate. Fred T. Colter
of Apache, C. M. Shannon of
Pinal and C. M. Roberts of Co
chise will likely be in the race
and it is possible that Wiley E.
Jones may conclude to put his
name into the free for all jacK
pot. It is nearly a year before
election day and several others
may get the feeling as the water
is tine. Messenger.
HUNTING FOR GRASS.
The great cattle movements
from drouth districts over the
country to other ranges has
made a demand upon the rail
roads of the country that they
have been unable to supply.
About 100,000 cattle have to be
moved from South Texas, and it
is estimated that there will be a
movement of 300,000 from the
San Angelo and Midland dis
tricts and the scope of country
intervening. Grass is being hunt
ed for high and low. You meet
cowmen on the train on the
roads in automobiles, in the
hotels, everywhere, hunting for
grass. They say Arizona has
more Texas cowmen in it than
ever before. The greater parfr
of New Mexico is in good con
dition, but there are some very
dry spots. The railroad admin
istrators of the country promise
relief soon, and expect to de
spatch 3000 cars. We need them,
and then some more.
Pall plowing should be con
tinued as long as the ground is
in proper condition, and as a
rule soil is in better condition
from breaking in the south dur
ing November than any other
month. Demonstration records
collected by the department for
several years indicate that deep
fall plowing and thorough pre
paration of the seed bed have
greatly increased the yield of all
crops on the average southern
farm. A cover crop of rye or
oats may be sown after break
ing, but where this is not prac
tical the land may be left in the
rough until later, when the disk,
roller, and smoothing harrow
can be used to put it into condition.

The Spirit of Friendship.
This store looks upon its patrons not
merely as customers but as friends.
People purchase here because they
have friendly feeling for this store.
The cause which develops this friendly
feeling, may differ, in fact, they are
sure to differ. One's friendship for
the store is the result of finding good
values; another's is the result of effi
cient service and courteous treatment,
and so on.
Naturally this friendshiply feeling on
the part of our patrons is reciprocated
on our part. And this spirit of mutual
friendship is an impetus for greater
service and an incentive to ever-increasing
endeavor to make this store
a place where every visitor will feel
perfectly at home.
