Hazard and Miller, the pioneer
patent agency of Los Angeles,
has received by wire from Wash
ington, notice of the issuance of
the following patents to Arizona
inventors; Robt. L. Moore, Glee

Roscetta, of Jerome, for a chain.
The growth and increasing im
portance of the corporation com
mission of Arizona is shown in
the annual report of that com
mission which has just been is
sued and contains the proceed
ings of that department of the
state for the year from July 1,
1916 to June 30, 1917.
The contention of County At
torney John P. Ross and the
ruling of Judge Lockwood, both
of Cochise county, that it was
not necessary for a preliminary
examination be given to parties
charged with a violation of the
prohibition law, has bean up
held by a decision rendered a
few days ago in the case of the
state vs. Bob Birch from Yava

According to advertising and
large bills and circulars issued
by the boosters of Gleeson, an
other cowboy celebration is an
nounced for May 5th, which falls
on Sunday, for which over $1,
000 in prizes has been offered to
the winners of numerous con
tests to be staged. The day is
to be one of gala cowboy sports
with racing, broncho busting,
steer tying and roping, bulldog
ging contests, drilling contest
of miners, and claimed to be far
better than ever before attempt
ed in Gleeson.
Agua Prieta has been given
pei mission by the state govern-,
ment of Sonora to sell to the
public 300 barrels of bottled
beer for the benefit of the school
of that place. Some of the beer
will be sold in the municipality
of Nacozari. No date has been
set for the reason that, when a
date was named before the beer
failed to arrive in time, and the
disappointment of those who had
looked forward to the foaming
beverage was quite keen. This
time the beer will be on hand
before anything is said about
selling it.
More than 21,000 motor vehi
cle licenses have been issued
from the office of secretary of
state thus far this year. They
are still coming in at the rate of
50 a day, and the 25,000 mark is
expected to be passed in a short
time, according to officials of
that office. The whole number
of motor vehicle licenses issued
in Arizona for 1917 was 19,842.
The first order to the license
plate manufacturer was for 25,
000 plates for Arizona. These
will soon be exhausted, and pre
paratious have been made for a
second shipment of plates.
If Governor Hunt calls a spe-
cial session of the legislature, to
Dr. Howard Davis, represent
ative for Pinal county, will fall
the honor of introducing a bill
asking that one hundred and
sixty acres of state land be
granted to every soldier or sailor
from this state who has enlisted
in the military or naval service
of the United States. It was
from this valley that the idea
emanated that resulted in a law
being passed suspending the an
nual assessment work on mines
during the period of the war,
and the glorious thought of help
ing the soldier boys to get a
start after the war lound its in

Arizona is starting in good
shape on her share of the war
work. County Councils of De
fense have been completed in
every county, headed by the re
presentative citizens here listed:
Apache, Herber Jarvis, Saint

Each County Council has an
Executive Committee, compris
ing the chairman, secretary and
treasurer and the heads of the
principal committees, those on
Public Defense, Production, Wel
fare Work and Finance. The
Defense Committee especially
will guard the public safety,
keeping close watch for possible
treasonable actions within the
county and helping in military
preparation. The Production
Committee has the important
work of stimulating food pro
duction and securing proper bar
vesting and marketing condi
tions. Welfare Work deals es
peeially with keeping close track
of all county men in the coun
try's service and providing for
their dependents, at need. The
Finance Committee will have no
empty honor, for funds must be
provided for emergency work
and maintenance of headquart
ers. Now, the work is being still
further subdivided into Commun
ity Councils on lines suggested
by President Wilson, reaching
into the school districts. In
agricultural districts, such as
the Salt River valley and the
Gila valley, their operations un
doubtedly will be in co-operation
with those of the farm bureaus
already established by Univer
sity effort, with especial atten
tion to the production of food
stuffs. Guardian.

EXPLOSIVES REGULATIONS.
To Prevent Disloyal Persons From
Procuring Explosives.
A war measure, the intent and
purpose of the Federal Explo
sives Act is "To prevent dis
lo.yal persons from procuring
explosives or their ingredients
and to keep explosives and in
gredients out of the hands of
persons who will not protect
them carefully enough to pre
vent them from being stolen or
used for unlawful purposes."
Manufacturers, vendors, pur
chasers, importers, exporters,
analysis, and foremen are the
classes of licenses. In Arizona
the majority of licenses issued
are to vendors, purchasers, anal
ysis and foremen.
Proprietors of hardware, gen
eral merchandise and d rugstores,
and contractors require vendor's
licenses in addition to which
there must be a licensed fore
man who handles the explosives
and issues them from the maga
zine. Farmers and contractors, who
use explosives, prospectors, min
ing and construction companies,
require purchasers's licenses
and also a licensed foreman un
less the original purchaser acts
also in the capacity of foreman,
handling all the explosives and
remaining on the ground to issue
powder and see that all unused
portions are returned to the
magazine. With large concerns
it is obviously impossible for the
original purchaser to act in the
capacity of foreman.
Thefts of powder are to be re
ported to the Licensors, State
Inspector and Director Bureau
of Mines, Washington, D. C.
Thefts of ores do not come un
der the jurisdiction of the State
Inspector of Explosives except
stolen powder be involved or
used unlawfully and without a
license, in which case it is to be
reported to him but in any case
all thefts of machinery or ores
should be reported to the local
officers.
County Clerks, Clerks of
Boards of Supervisors, Justices
of the Peace and Notaries Public
are usually appointed licensing
officers, the Director Bureau of
Mines may, for enforcement of
the law, utilize all federal, state
and county police, such as the
U. S. Marshal, county sheriffs
and their deputies, and munici
pal police officers.
Unlawfully using, selling or
possessing explosives is punish
able by a fine not exceeding
$5000 or by imprisonment not
more than one year or by both
such fine and imprisonment.
Following is a list of U. S.
Licensors for Santa Cruz county:
Laura Parsons, Nogales; George
S. Francis, Patagonia; H. L.
Corl, Nogales; W. M. Heady,
Duquesne; Josiah Bond, Alto;
W. F. Christman, Sonoita; R. R.

Mining Means Much tor Arizona.
When a person looks through
the Arizona papers for items
showing industrial activity one
is struck with the fact that the
majority of items pertain to the
mining industry.
This is the most convincing
proof that mining is the state's
great industry and for this
reason Arizona citizens should
consider well any measures or
conditions which tend to dis
courage its expansion.
The mines employ thousands
of laborers at good wages, en
courage development of electri
cal energy, use large quantities
of lumber, support numerous
other industries in the state, and
last but not leant, carry the
heavier share of the tax burden.
Polices which encourage min
ing in Arizona are for the best in
terest of the state at large.

The undersigned hereby an
nounces himself as a candidate

WORK LOW GRADE ORES.
The big mining companies of
Bisbee have at last decided that
the low grade coppers overlying
the rich ore bodies of the War
ren district have potential values
that will make that district one
of the most wonderful copper
sections of the globe. The work
of clearing off the overburden
and getting an ocular sizing up
of the ore bearing possibilities
of the camp is now under way
and the big mills will soon be a
reality. The tonnage to be run
through the mills will be above
10,000 daily and will give the
smelters a most desirable pro
duct to mix with the raw ores of
the mines. The development of
the low grade ore bodies will
add thousands of men to the
payroll of the Copper Queen
and Calumet & Arizona and
make the district one of the
largest employers of miners of
any camp in the world.
Personal Desires Campaign Issues.
While passing through Flag
staff on Monday the editor of
the Flagstaff Leader interview
ed W. A. Moeur about campaign
issues. In his usual epigram
matic way of expression, the
state land commissioner said:
Personal desires are the only
things that have appeared in
the gubernatorial race thus far
that might be termed issues, so
far as I have observed.
"I can see no so called issues
ahead of us in this campaign.
We should pull together for the
good of the state and the coun
try. Conditions in Arizona right
now are good. Sheep, cattle
and mining men are prosperous.
Labor has no complaint, so far
as 1 can see; neither has capital.
I feel that a man who would
start any trouble between em
ployers and employes at the pre
sent time would be an enemy of
his country." Messenger.

CHAUTAUQUA WEEK.
Seven Days of Musical and Literary
Treat for Nogales.
The first announcement of the
Chautauqua program for this
season in Nogales, for the week
commencing May 2nd, indicates
clearly that it is dedicated chief
ly to national service.
President Wilson has strongly
endorsed the Chautauqua in a
letter saying, "Let me express
the hope that you will let no
discouragement weaken yourac
tivities, and that the people will
not fail in the support of a pa
triotic institution that may be
said to be an integral part of the
the national defense." That the
Other officials of Washington are
of the same mind is evidenced
by the fact that the government
has requested special lecturers
to be sent over every Chautau
qua circuit in the United States.
Piobably the most important
government accredited lecturer
to appear on our week's pro
gram will be Lincoln L. Wirt,
war correspondent direct from
the Western Front. He was sent
by the government solely to ob
tain information on the actual
conditions in Europe and to pre
sent them to Chautauqua au
diences. He sailed for Europe
February 13, and brings the last
word from the war zone, deal
ing chiefly with Pershing and
"our boys" in the American sec
tion of the line.
The LT. S. Food Administra
tion, under the direction of Her
bert Hoover, is sending a food
demonstrator to Chautauqua on
the morning of the last day to
present new recipes and man
ners of conserving food which
have been evolved in the gov
erqment kitchens at Washing
ton. This demonstration will be
free to everyone.
Another lecturer commission
ed by Washington, Dr. C. J.
Bushnell, who will be in con
stant touch with the Bureau of
Information, will present at
Chautauqua our war problems,
as seen by the government, on
this side of the Atlantic.
Perhaps the most thrilling and
interesting war lecture of the
week will be that given by Capt
J. M. de Beaufort of the Belgian
artillery. Capt. de Beaufort is
the author of Behind the Ger
man Veil," one of the "best sell
ers among present year war
books, now in its seventh edi
tion. Bearing a letter from von
Hindenburg s nephew, which
acted as a magic passport, he
spent four months in Germany,
visiting naval and Zeppelin
bases, the Russian front, and in
terviewing many of the big Ger
man military leaders, including
Hindenburg.
Other prominent lecturers of
the week will be, "Burns of the
Mountains," H. V. Adams, Ned
Woodman and Edna Eugenia
Lowe.
Quite a departure from ordin
ary Chautauqua attractions will
be presented on the third night
in "Plays of Our Allies" by the
Luzerne Players. These are
short dramas, masterpieces of
the great European playwrights,
truly portraying the life of our
allied peoples.
A strong patriotic note will be
reached in the music of the
week. The feature attraction
for the first night will be the
"Old Soldier Fiddlers," under
the direction of Col. J. A. Pat
tee. These old veterans of the
civil war, two from the north
and two from the south, present
a rousing patriotic program of
instrumental music, camp fire
and war time songs. The most
noteworthy musical attraction
of the week will be on the fifth
day when Thaviu's Exposition
Band comes to Chautauqua for
two programs. This band was
honored with opening and clos
ing the San Francisco Exposi
tion and is both the largest and
the best band ever brought over
the Western Chautauqua. In
their evening program they will
be assisted by three Chicago
grand opera singers. Other mu
sical attractions will be the
Treble Clef Club; Morrison
Smith Company; Zedeler Sym
phonic Quintet and the Fenwick
Newell Concert Company.
The closing evening at Chau
tauqua will be known as "An
Evfcniner in Hawaii," featuring
the Royal Hawaiian Quintet and I
Mildred Loo Clemens in her
illustrated travelogue, "Travel
ing Through Paradise" Miss
Clemens, cousin of Mark Twain,
journeyed to the Hawaiian Is
lands fifty years after Mark
Twain's sojourn there, visited
the places he has made famous
in his writings and brings re
markable dissolving views and
motion pictures of the places of
interest, including Mt. Kilauea,
Hawaii's active volcano.
GEORGIA BOWMAN IS DEAD.
j p QUALITY.
Lovely Little Child Fatally
While at Play.
Burned
Last Thursday forenoon, while
at play with the little children
of Mr. and Mrs. Wilson and Mr.
and Mrs. Farragut, near the
Bowman inanshion on Cavalry
Hill, Georgia Bowman, the darl
ing little four year old daughter
of Mr. and Mrs. Wirt. G. Bow
man, was fatally burned, by her
clothing catching fire from blaz
ing paper, with which the chil
dren were playing. The children
were alone at t he time, and no one
is able to tell just how the terri
ble accident happened.
Workmen near the Bowman
home, and neighbors, hearing
Georgia's screams, hurried to
her rescue and quickly extin
guished the fire, Out not before
the "pet of Nogales" had been
so terrible burned that she died
a couple of hours after being
carried to her home, where all
that physicians who were imme
diately rushed to the scene,
could do to save her.
News of the terrible accident
shocked and saddened every
body in Nogaies, for Little Geor
gia Bowman was beloved by all.
Beautiful and unusually bright
for one of her age, she was the
favorite of old and young. The
entire community mourns her
loss.
In their hour of terrible sor
row, the heartbroken father,
mother and sisters, have the
fullest, sincere sympathy of
everybody in Nogales.
The funeral yesterday from
the Episcopal church, was at
tended by hundreds, who mourn
the tragic death of one of the
fairest flowers that ever bloom
ed. Interment was in the Ma
sonic cemetery.
CARD OF THANKS.
We desire to thank our many
friends for the kind assistance
rendered us in our great bereave
ment and loss of our dearly be
loved little daughter and sister,
Georgia.
