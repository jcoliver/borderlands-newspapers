NOVEMBER 8. 1919.
AMERICAN LEGION DAY.
Governor Campbell by Proclamation
Makes Nov. II a Holiday.
November 11. 1919, is the first
anniversary of the most notable
event in the world's history, the
signing of the armistice which
brought to an end the greatest
armed conflict within the knowl
edge of man and the triumph of
the principle of Right over
Might.
Arizona, in common with her
sister states of the union, trave
freely in men and treasure to the
cause of mankind, loyally and
generously responding without
hesitation or question to the call
of patiiotic duty.
The survivors of the great war
have banded themselves into a
non partisan organization, the
principles of which make for
better citizenship, foremost of
which are fidelity to the consti
tution, unalterable conviction
that the flag of our land is the
symbol of liberty, equality and
justice to all over whom it waves
uncompromising opposition to
open or covert attacks upon our
government, be it in the form of
Bolshevism, I. W. W. ism or
what not, and the preservation
of American institutions, not
only for the safety, happiness
and prosperity of present, but
future generations.
Whereas, The patriotism of
peace program of this organiza
tion embraces so many worthy
objects, the least of which in
cludes the material welfare of
its members, it is but fitting that
due honor, by formal observ
ance, be paid to these men who
sacrificed so much in our behalf.
Now Therefore I, Thomas E.
Campbell, governor of the state
of Arizona, by virtue of the au
thority vested in me by law, do
declare Tuesday, the 11th day
of November, 1919, as "Amer
ican Liegion Day," and set aside
the same as a public holiday,
urging the people of this state
to participate in the meetings
commemorative of a momentous
event, to be held under the au
spices of the posts of the Amer
ican Legion throughout Arizona,
not only that deserved homage
may be paid to these, our valiant
defenders, but also to the end
that inspiration be gained for
the ever constant crusade for
higher ideals of citizenship.
In Witness Whereof I have
hereunto set my hand and caus
ed the Great Seal of the State
of Arizona to be affixed.
Thomas E. Campbell,
Governor.

HOTEL ALBIN.
In today's issue of The Bor
der Vidette appears the ad
vertisement of Hotel Albin, at
Guaymas, operated under the
able, painstaking personal man
agement of Captain J. G. Will
oughby, a pastmaster in the
hotel business, who during the
past four years has endeared
himself to Mexicans and for
eigners alike.
Mine Host Captain J. G. Will
oughby, who, by the way, oc
cupies the high position of
"Irish Consul," thoroughly un
dertands the art of entertaining
ladies and gentlemen of all na
tions, and is untiring in his ef
forts to make his guests feel at
home. As a result. Hotel Albin
which overlooks the beautiful
bay of Guaytnas, is headquarters
for tourists from all parts of the
world.
The pleasant dining room pro
vides the choicest the market
affords at reasonable prices.
When in Guaymas, go to the
Albin. Captain Willoughby will
do the rest.
Arizona Football Team Wins.
On November 2nd, at Mesilla
Park, New Mexico, the Univer
sity of Arizona football eleven
defeated the New Mexican Agri
cultural College team by a score
of 33 to 0. It is said the fast
Arizona men had the Aggies at
their mercy throughout the game
and were never in danger. From
start to finish the Tucson boys
showed excellent team work and
played a snappy game.
East is East and West is West.
Bat the two at last have met.
Since the days of P. T. Bar
num it has been the privilege of
showmen to upset the natural
order of events and defy the
laws of nature in order that man
may be amused. Pink elephants,
double jointed monkeys and un
mentionable monstrosities as
well as the original and genuine
of nature's freaks have been pre
sented to the world through the
media of the white tops.
In more recent years showmen
have striven to give the beauti
ful and instructive features to
the public and like an Aladdin's
lantern the big tops have be
come a veritable paradise of en
chantment. The Al. G. Barnes big four
ringed animal circus is coming
to Nogales November 13 for a
one day exhibit.giving afternoon
and night performances, and as
its opening feature this season
presents a fairyland fantasy,
namely, "Alice in Jungleland,"
which promises to outrival in
reality anything Lewis Carrol's
character, "Alice," saw in her
dreamland jaunt through Won
derland. Alice is a delightful child who
falls asleep upon a rustic seat in
a park, fairies appear and by
magic bring to her a king in all
his loyal splendor, who, wishing
to please Alice and show his
many possessions, orders the
royal jungle to appear. Instant
ly a magnificient pageant com
prising the shows entire aggre
gation of animals and people
richly and sumptuously adorned
coma forth; a riot of color, a
jingle of music. Rajahs, queens,
kings, knights and their royal
cortege in fitting equipment,
jungle natives, magnificent hor
ses, all handsomely caparisoned
in fact, a festive feast of fairy
land wonder.
There will be a street parade
at 10:30 a. m.
This week Mr. James H. Cun
ningham, the mining man, has
been at Guaymas, a guest at
Hotel Albin.

WAR ON WHITE PLAGUE.
Members of the American
Anti - Tuberculosis Association
are being urged to write Senat
ors Ashurst and Smith and Ra
presentative Hayden, requesting
them to support Senate Bill
1660 which provides for a "Divi
sion of Tuberculosis" in the U.
S. Public Health Service. The
measure has been reported fav
orably by the Committee on
Public Health and Quarantine.
The duties of the newly estab
lished division will be "to study
tuberculosis and its causes and
prevention and to demonstrate
methods for its suppression."
When we stop to consider that
tuberculosis causes more deaths
every year than any other one
disease, it seems only just that
it should be granted a place of
importance in the United States
Public Health Service. One
hundred and fifty thousand per
sons died of tuberculosis last
year and, according to statistics
gathered through draft examin
ations in the various states, it is
safe to say that there are eight
living cases for every death.
We in Arizona see what terri
ble ravages this disease makes
upon our population because of
the large number of migratory
cases which come to the south
west. The migratory problem
cannot be solved by a state or a
section of our country, and it is
only through a Department such
as this bill is attempting to es
tablish, that we can hope in any
measure to control it. The'es
tablishmentof a Federal Depart
ment of Tuberculosis would give
opportunity for the study of ex
isting conditions, as well as re
search for some cure. This is a
problem of vital interest to all.

CALLED
HER FAMILY
TO HER
Six Years Ago, TLinking She Might Die, Says Texas Lady, But lov
She Is a Well, Strong Woman and Praises Cardui For
Ker Recovery.
Rors9 City, Ter. Mrs. Mary Kil
man, of this place, says; "After the
birth of my little girl... my side com
menced to hurt me. I had to go back
to bed. We called the doctor. He
treated me hut I got no better. I
got worse and worse until the misery
was unbearable. . .1 was In bed for
three moatUs and suffered such agony
that I was just drawn up In a knot. . .
I told my husband If he would get
ne a bottle of Cardul I would try it. . .
i commenced taking It, however, that
Trenins I called my family about
e... for I 1:tcw I could not last
:cn.y days unjfesa I hr.d a change for
the better. That was Ix years ago
and I am still here and am a well,
strong woman, and I owe my life to
Cardui. I had only taken half ths
bottle when I began to feel better.
The misery in my side got less... I
continued right on taking the Cardul
until I had taken thiee bottles and I
did not ned any more for I was well
and never felt better in my life... I
have nevtr had any trouble from that
day to this."
Do you suffer from headache, back
ache, pains in sides, or other discom
forts, each month? Or do you feel
weak, nervous and fagged-out? If so,
give Cardui, the woman's tonic, a
trial. J. 71
