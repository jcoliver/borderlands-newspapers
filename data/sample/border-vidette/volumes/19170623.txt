Phoenix Knights of Cdlarnbris
have raised approximately $5,C00
for the Liberty loan aside from
individual subscriptions!, it was
announced yesterday. The organ
ization has raised approximately
865,000 in the state to date.
Coming; at just the right
moment, when things looked as
if Arizona would be unable to
till its quota for the liberty loan.
Senator William A. Clark, owner
of the United Verde Copper com
pany at .lerorne, today bought
in the name of that mine, to be
credited to Arizona's quota, si,

Misleading and fake reports
of disaster to American arms
should be discouraged and the
war department can do much to
discourage such reports by deal
ing fairly with the people and
give out all information in con
nection with the war other than
actual movements cf the army
anil navy that would be benefi
cial to the enemy. Blade.
Six thousand two hundred and
sixty-eight more automobiles are
running about Arizona today
than were burning gasoline at
this time last year, according
to the records of Secretary of
State Of bom. The 1.".. 700th
motorcar license was issued
Wednesday from that office. The
number in existence in Arizona
last year at this date was 0,432.
J.C. Gatti, the wholesale meat
dealer and butcher of Clifton,
Arizona, was in Phoeuix a few
days ago. He came to the val
ley to buy fat beef stock but the
grades here were too high for
his market, hence he went away
without making a purchase. Mr.
Gatti tries to supply his - market -with
beef at 13 Cc?nts a pound
wholesale hence he is restricted
to range cows that' are fat and
to careful buying else where.
Official figures show Arizona
went over its quota of 34,814 by
21 1H. When the supplemental
figures are gathered and added
the total over the .quota will be
something like (5000. The official
total figures for registration day
are as follows: Total white re
gistration, 21,740; possible white
exemptions, 12,020; total colored
registration, 847; possible color
ed exemptions, 222; total aliens,
14,052; total alien enemies, 193.
As I walked along the paths
this rooming, plucking flowers,
I found, in the yellow heart of a
lady slipper, a little brown bee.
My first impulse was to shake
her out of her honeyed abode,
but as 1 looked at her velvety
body and suralit, rainbow wings,
a feeling of foolish tenderness
surged over u.e. How useful
the littl" creature was, carrying
the pollen from tlower to flower
so 1 moved on leaving her un
molested. Hut even as J turned
away thinking these pure, sweet
thoughts, the damned thing
stung me.
Petitions asking the Board of
Supervisors to call an election
for a bond issue covering good
road construction are being cir
culated in Tombstone and are
being signed by every person
practically, to whom they are
presented. A bond issue for
good roads will be a great aid in
every direction and more espe
cially if we are to continue in
this war for the saving of trans
porta tion and as a military high
way the Borderland is a logical
route. Good roads and peace,
good roads and war. all three go
hand in hand. Prospector.
Another badger fight was
pulled off last night on the more
or less blood stained battlefield,
back of McNary's drug store.
The details are such that this
paper refuses to give them
pulicity. As an indication of
just now had it was, Mr. ogai
who chaperoned the badger,
admits that it was the most brut
al exhibition he ever witnessed.
Thanks to the energy of Joe
Roland's bull dog and the vigor
ous jerk with which Mr. Vogal
brought the badger into the con
flict, a new badger will have to
be procured before the next fight 1
comes off. Tempe News.
Mclntyre Brother u. D. C

inethod of irrigating, discing
and then planting is generally
followed by farmers in this coun

El Paso A Southwestern railroad
tonight it was announced that
this company had arranged to
purchase $i ,000,000 worth of

RED CROSS DOLLARS ARE GOOD
AS BULLETS.
"Hundreds of American doc
tors and nurses are already at
the front. A force of 12,000
American engineers will soon be
rebuilding the railroads of
Prance. Upwards of 25,000
American men are now on the
battlefields of Europe, lighting
as volunteers in the Allied ar
mies; soon, 25,000 American re
gulars will be added to their
number. All our National Guard
will be mobilized, our regular
Army is to be recruited to full
strength, and 500,000 other men
are shortly to be called to the
colors. Within a few months
we should and will have in serv
ice an army of 1,000,000 and a
navy of 150,000 meu.
These men must have our best.
To prepare against their needs
in advance will be a stupendous
task which the Red Cross must
undertake. Doctors, nurses,
ambulances, must be ready. Vast
quantities of hospital stores, lin
on, bandages and supplies of
every kind must be prepared
and at once. If we wait, it may
be too late. When we ask our
own sons and brothers to fight
for liberty 3,000 miles from home
iu a country already sore and af
flicted, surely we cannot do less
than prepare to take care of them
in their day of suffering.
"Gallant Canada from 8,000,

450,000 men. Eighty thousand
are dead or injured, and Can
ada has raised in value 10,000,

her sick and wounded. Her Red
Cross, thus vitalized by the sac

been able to save thousands from

ALL ABOARD FOR FRANCE.
Pershing is in Europe and his
command of 40,000 regulars,
marines and Jackies will arrive
in France during the present
month. The national guard will
follow in July and August. If
the men of Arizona desire to get
to the front speedly and in a
body of troops assignated as
Arizonans there is a chance to
j do so by tilling up the First Ar
! izona at once. It needs about
j 100O men to till its ranks to full
1 war streugth. Those who wait
I for the selective draft, will have
no choice as to companions with
whom they will serve or the mil
itary branch to which they will
be assigned. To those who
want to go to France soon the
First Arizona offers the best op
portunity. Messenger.
CHILDREN'S DAY.
Judge W. A. O'Connor Makes Address
at Fruitland Hall.
An interesting program was
given last Sunday at Fruitland
Hall, in celebration of Children's
: Hay, by the Sunday school chil
. clren of the communities of So
j noita, Fruitland and Elgin, says
the Santa Cruz Patagonian. The
; services were well attended, and
I a basket dinner was enjoyed.
' Miss Fern Bartlett, the Elgin
j teacher, drilled the children,
j and helped them with their
pieces, which were all delivered
in a splendid manner, reflecting
credit upon both teacher and
pupil. Music was furnished
throughout the exercisfes by a
quartet composed of Miss Dixie
Collie, Messrs. Collie, elder and
junior, J. S. Carver, .with Miss
Bartlett accompanist.
In the afternoon Superior
Judge W. A. O'Connor made an
address. He was scheduled to
speak on "Christian Education,"
but digressed to make a few re
marks about the war. He ex
plained that democracy and lib
erty, for which our forbears un
der Washington and other pat
riots fought in the early days,
were again at stake, and this
time upon a much larger scale.
In the days of Washington, the
American people were lighting
lor the freedom of this republic;
today they are lighting to make
this freedom worldwide, The
same principle is involved, only
changed from its local character
to one of universal application.
The judgo warmed up to his
subject and brought out the pow
er of the trained orator in a
scathing denunciation of the
kaiser and his un scrupulous
methods. The audience broke
into a spontaneous burst of ap
plause. Returning to the topic of edu
cation, the judge staled that
nearly one-half of all taxes col
lected in Arizona from all sour
ces were spent for school pur
poses, a very gratifying condi
tion, and one equaled by few
other States. He traced the de
velopment of the modern public
school, from the "little red
school house" of early New En
gland days, when pupils brought
and studied any book they wish
ed, from the Bible to an almanac,
to the present carefully prepar
ed and thorough course of grad
ed studies. The judge said he
was largely a product of the
public schools, and was proud
of it; also for many years he
taught in the public school of
this county.
He encouraged the young peo
ple to get an education. Not to
be content with the grammar
school, but to continue on
through High school and the
University.
REMEDY FOR POISONOUS BITES
The Safford Bulletin tells of a
man, Mr. C. P. Schroeder, liv
ing near that place, who was
cured of a rattlesnake bite by
using prickly pear cactus. He
was bitten on the hand by a
rattler and remembering that an
old-timer had told him that the
prickly pear would take the
poison out, he cut a piece from
the cactus and opened it, put
ting the inside next his hand.
The swelling stopped almost im
mediately, and in a few hours
began to go down. At night he
put another slab ou. He was
able to keep on working and
suffered no inconvenience what
ever from the bite. Mr. Schroed
er claims the cactus is good to
take the poison out of any kind
of bite. He has had experience
in using it on scorpion bites, as
well as the rattlesnake bite.
Rev. Trever Orton, who for
merly worked in the Patagonia
field, is now located in the Elgin
Sonoita country, where he is
doing missionary work, special
izing on Sunday School work.
Last week the reverend gentle
man had the misfortune to lose
all his personal effects, includ
ing his library, etc., in a lire
which completely destroyed the
house he had bean living iu.
The house was owned by Daniel
Sauer.
RETURN TO THE FARM.
Randolph Reuser returned
last Monday from Nogales,
where he has been at work for
some time. Mr. Reuser says he
comes hack to see about putting
in a summer crop on his nlaca
down the river. He is also con
sidering taking up an additional
homestead of 320 acres, with tha
idea of going into cattle raising
later on. However, he will not
let farming operations interfere
with serving the country if his
services are required. He was
formerly a baker in the tran
sport service of the government,
with an honorable discharge,
and he signified his willingsess
to re enlist in case his services
are required Benson Signal.
WHAT WE FIGHT FOR.
"The right is more precious

small nations, for a universal
dominion of right by such a con

peace and safety to all nations

STOMACH TROUBLE
Mr. Marion Holcomb, of Nancy, Ky., says: "For quite
a long while I suffered with stomach trouble. I would
have pains and a heavy feeling after my meals, a most
disagreeable taste in my mouth. If I ate anything with
butter, oil or grease, I would spit it up. I began to have
regular sick headache. I had used pills and tablets, but
after a course of these, I would be constipated. It just
seemed to tear my stomach all up. I found they were
no good at all for my trouble. ( heard
