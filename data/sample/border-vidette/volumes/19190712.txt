ARIZONA NOTES.
Items of Interest Culled From Our
Exchanges.
When the degree of Doctor of
Laws, honoris causa" was con
ferred upon Dr. KleinSmid, pres
ident of the Universitv of Ari
zona, by the National University
of Mexico, it was the first time
in the history of the University,
that a foreigner had been so
honored.
The University of Arizona
this year is offering a five weeks
course in practical stock raising.
A week will be given to study
in Tucson and then four weeks
will be spent in the field. In
structions will be given in stock
breeding, management, financ
ing, marketing and transporta
tion, with consideration also of
range capacity.
J. N. McKnight, well known
local cattleman, who left yester
day for San Angelo, Texas, in
his Cadillac roadster, wired to
friends last night, that he made
the trip from Douglas to El
Paso, a'distance of 264 miles, in
eight hours and 45 minutes.
This is practically as fast as the
stretch was made a few years
ago in the El Paso Phoenix road
race. Douglas International.
In one March order the Mon
tana State Agricultural College
sold 15,000 pounds of rodent
poison bait to county farm bu
reaus of the state. The state
college has erected a special
building where the gopher poi
son bait is mixed and sold at
cost, averaging about 15 cents a
quart. The county agents are
co operating with the college
and obtaining bait for rodent
concrol campaigns. Where there
are no county agents orders are
handled by local organizations.

VICTORY BUTTONS COMING
"Victory buttons," authorized
by the war department for issue
to soldiers who participated in
the war zone, will soon be avail
able for Arizona men who serv
ed in uniform, it was announced
recently in Phoenix. The but
tons will be given to officers and
enlisted men of all branches
after their discharge from the
army.
The buttons are of two varie
ties, silver for men who were
wounded and bronze for those
who escaped injury.
Field clerks, and members of
the army nurse corps will be
eligible to wear the buttons, but
members of the student army
training corps will not receive
them.
A GREAT SILVER GROUP.
A body of ore has recently
been uncovered at the Great Sil
ver group in Jefferson Camp,
which gives promise of develop
ing into something big. This
property has been worked con
stantly by the owners, George
F. Wieland and J. W. Wilson,
for a long time and it now looks
as if these gentlemen were at
last to be rewarded for their
hard labor and money expended
in development work. The new
body carries silver, gold and
lead, with a small percentage of
copper, and apparently is far
richer than other ore shipped
from this property in the past,
which returned better than 50
ounces of silver to the ton.

LIVE WIRE MINING MAN.
B. B. Smith, who has charge
of the work at the Abe Lincoln
or Blue Nose mine, recently
bonded by Colonel R. R. Rich
ardson to the Layman Syndicate
of Jerome, is one of the most
competent mining men who has
recently come to the district, as
his wont at this new old prop
erty indicates. Mr. Smith is a
practical man who believes in
doing things while the "doing"
is good. Taking charge of this
property a few weeks ago, he
has already accomplished won
ders and the camp has under
gone many changes. Necessary
buildings are being constructed,
pure water has been piped to
the mine a distance of 3000 feet,
machinery has been hauled out
and installed, and a force of men
is employed in sinking opera
tions, three shifts being used
that the work may be rushed to
completion and the question de
termined whether or not the
Blue Nose will re'peat its won
derful record as a producer of
the white metal.
Mr. Smith is confident that he
will make a mine out of this
property in a comparatively
short time, every indication, ac
cording to Mr. Smith's judg
ment, being in favor of success
with practically no possibility of
failure. Patagonian.
THE AMERICAN LEGION.
It has been earnestly stated,
as might have been expected,
that the American Legion will
be strictly non patisan. This
much might be inferred from
the circumstance that one of the
leading associates of Roosevelt
in organizing the Legion, is
Lieut. Col. Bennett Clark, a son
of the late-.Democratic Speaker
of the House of Representatives.
Colonel Roosevelt is sufficient
authority for the assurance that
the movement is neither parti
san nor political. He calls it
"an association which will keep
alive the principles of justice,
freedom and democracy for
which these veterans fought."
Viewed in that sentimental, eth
ical and patriotic light, it is a
commendable undertaking. The
American people will wish it
well, and be glad to see it
flourish.
The American Legion should
be a strong body and radiate a
powerful intluence of the steady
ing, patriotic kind. We should
say that not far from four mil
lion men will be ultimately eligi
ble to membership, if every one
who wore the American uniform
is qualified for admission. Such
a body, composed largely of the
cream of our young citizenship,
should prove a mighty conserva
tive aud salutary influence.

The Karns Brothers Service
I Station states that the reason
I this battery can be safely guar
; anteed for so long a time is be
cause it is built like the truss-
work of a bridge or the skeleton
righting mast of a battleship.
The plates of the battery are
built on a frame work or grid,
the bars of which run diagonally
from side to side forming diam
onds instead of the ordinary
squares. The result of this diag
onal bracine is a plate that is

as it is braced to resist the in
ternal strains resulting from the
operation of the battery, no mat
ter in what direction they may
occur. The Karns Brothers Ser

of storage battery and if a stor
age battery is beyond repair it
can replace it with the proper
