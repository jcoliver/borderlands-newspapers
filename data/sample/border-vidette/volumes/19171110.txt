Before Judge S. L. Pattee of
Pima County, in the superior
court today a judgment in favor
of Harry C. Wheeler, sheriff,
was rendered, which will allow
the plaintiff back salary dating
back from January 1, 1915, to
March 15, 1917, when the new
law passed by the last legislature
went into effect. When Judge
McAlister of Graham county,
decided several back salary
cases here several months ago,
it was generally conceded that
the case of the Sheriff would
stand a favorable chance,
although the suit had not been
brought at that time. Since then,
however, Attorney W. G. Gil
mora for Sheriff Wheeler tiled
suit and the result was that the
case was decided in favor of the
plaintiff and back salary allowed
in the sum of $2195. Another
case up today, that of County
Attorney J. P. Ross for back
salary was taken under advise

WILL. FIGHT TO. FINISH.
Senator Mark Smith Addressed No
gales Citizens at Club.
"This war must be fought un
til the abdication of the Kaiser
or to an unconditional sur
render." Thus spoke Senator
Mark Smith of Arizona to a
gathering of prominent Nogales
citizens at the Santa Cruz club
Saturday evening.
"I have been in favor of war
with Germany since the sinking
of the . Lusitania. Germany
brought war with the United
States upon herself and we will
win even should every one of
our allies lay down their arms.
This country will fight to the
last man and to her last dollar.
Germany is the only nation on
God's green earth that ever
denied the Monroe Doctrine and
has always wanted to take Uncle
Sam by the 'scruff' of the neck."
Senator Smith, the man that
serves so efficient on the Foreign
Relations Committee, fired his
listeners to undaunted patriotism
as he unfolded to them why the
United States was at war with
Huns. "Von Bernstorff," con
tinned Senator Smith, "spent
$40, 000, (XXI in spreading German
propaganda through the country.
He was nothing but a common
spy and a crook. He disobeyed
all International laws known to
diplomats of the world which
resulted in this nation asking him
to vacate immediately." The
Senator's praise of the Liberty
Loans was high. He said that
Arizona did far more than her
share thus showing the patrio
tism of the citizens of Arizona.
He said that be could rent
Alaska (if allowed) and pay the
interest on the entire National
debt at the end of the war. Said
that the United States owned
enough resources in the name of
the Government, not the posses
sions of individuals, to pay off
the total debt, interest and all
should the war continue for five
years, and not even feel it. He
said that the slacker and the
pacifist were tools of the Kaiser
and the nation has no use for
either. The Senator made a very
interesting informal talk which
was enjoyed by all present.
Later short talks were made by
Col. Hardy and his son Leslie.
