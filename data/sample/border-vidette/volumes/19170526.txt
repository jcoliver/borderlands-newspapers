MEXICO MAY HELP TO FEED THE
WORLD.
From Chihuhahua, Mexico,
comes the news that people of
that section are prepairing to
help feed the world, Now that
peace prevails in Mexico, ex
cept from a few scattered bands
of bandits that are being round
ed up and stood against the wall,
the republic to our south is ap
parently nearer back to civil life
than it has been in five years.
Peace in Mexico has its possi
bilities which are just beginn
ing to be realized by the state
and federal officials of the Mex
ican government. At this time,
when Mexico is one of the few
nations of the earth that is at
peace with the world, the re
public's inexhaustible supply of
natural wealth will be needed to
feed, clothe and equip the world.
In the state of Chihuahua,
alone, the mineral resources are
claimed to be greater than in
any other district of similar area
in the world. The mines of the
state never have been exhaust
ed, the untouched storehouses of
mineral wealth await develop
ment while many mines which
have been abandoned because of
depletion of precious metals may
be reopened and worked at a
profit for copper, lead and other
baser metals.
However, mineral compose
only one of the many groups of
natural resources which Mexico
has in abundance and which
never-have been developed be
yond the most primitive stages
bacause of the revolutions.
Wheat, corn, beans, maize, oats
and other cereals are capable of
being grown here in almost every
district of the state. Irrigation
projects have remained idle for
lack of workmen, rivers may be
dammed to water virgin lands
and underground water basins
offer another method of irrigat
ing the fertile lands.
Cotton and other textile and
fiber crops may also be grown
in this state, and because of the
supply of labor, can be produc
ed and sold on the American
market at a very low price.
Native rubber grows wild in
this state, forests exist which
have never been touched for
timber, millions of acres of graz
ing land are without cattle be
cause of the revolutions and it
has been predicted that Mexico
would be the future home of the
cattle industry in the American
continent. The Messenger.

There will be speeches, songs,
and music.
Everybody in the parade and
the onlookers are expected to

August Yarick, old time
mining man from Patagonia, is
a very sick man at the Sisters'
Hospital in this city, and little
hopes are entertained for his
recovery. Gus owns valuable
mining property in the Santa
Rita mountains, near Patagonia.
The recent snow and rain
storm is most welcome to the
dry farmers and stockraisers of
southern Arizona, especially in
Cochise, Pima and Santa Cruz
counties. Sunday morning there
was snow in the Santa Rita and
Patagonia mountains, something
very unusual for May.
Dr. Hardtmeyer, Patagonia
mining man, was a business vis
itor at the county seat last Thurs
day. Henry Levin, of Holler &
Levin, customs house brokers,
is financially interested with the
doctor in splendid mining prop
erties situated near Patagonia,
from which high grade ore is
being shipped.
Theeerrand ball last Saturday
nierht at the Nogales, Sonora
opera house in honor of Govern
or Calles of Sonora, was a most
delizhtful affair. A large num

side of the line, attended, and
all report having had a fine time.
Music was furnished by bov
ernor Calles' splendid military
band.
Prom many letters received
daily the war deoartment learns
that registration and selective
draft are being confounded,
according to a statement given
to the Official Bulletin, the gov
ernment daily paper editor by
George Creel.
These are separate and dis
tinct processes. Registration is
simply the enrolling of p.ll male
residents of the United States
between the ages of 21 and 30,
inclusive. Every male resident
between the designated ages
must register on the date set by
the president's proclamation
unless he is in the regular army,
the navy, the national guard,
or naval militia, actually in the
federal service.
The later process of selection
will be made by lot from the
names entered on the registra
tion rolls. Full information as
to exemptions and methods of
selection will be published later.
Owing to the fact that the age
limit between which registra
tion is required are narrower,
the federal registration will not
take as long nor amount to
many cases as did the state
gistration. ,

United States Tires have proved that they have
supreme quality,
that miles are packed into their structure the
way endurance is packed into steel.
A vast number of the motoring public know that
by experience,
and they have answered in the only way that
the buying public can answer,
by giving United States Tires tremendous sales
increases,
sales increases that are vastly greater than even
the sensational increase in the number of automobiles

THE PRESIDENT'S POSITION.
Congressman Byrnes of South
Carolina was resisting the con
scription bill. He exclaimed:
"You cannot tell me why
people changed overnight. I
know it is because the news
papers say: You are not stand
ing by the President.' "
There, in a few words, is the
substance of the relation of the
people the president and con
gress. Congress did not like the
conscription bill. Congress vot
ed for it because the president
asked it. And congressmen, in
not liking the conscription, were
often couscious of trying to rep
resent the feelings of their con
stituents. But the feeling of the
people is also that whatever the
legislation the president asks
for he should have. The people
have perfect confidence in the
president. If there had been a
popular vote on conscription,
and if the president had given
no hint of his wish and of the
nation's need, conscription would
have been overwhelmingly de
feated. But if the president
had asked the people to give
him conscription, and if there
had then been a popular vote,
not on the merits of conscrip
tion, but on whether he should
be given what he asked, the
result would have been over
whelmingly in favor of the pres
ident. All that is being done at
Washington rests upon this
foundation-the confidence of the
people in the President's lead
ership. Collier's.
