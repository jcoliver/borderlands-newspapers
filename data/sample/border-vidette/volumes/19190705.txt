The Spirit of Friendship.
This store looks upon its patrons not
merely as customers but as friends.
People purchase here because they
have friendly feeling for this store.
The cause which develops this friendly
feeling, may differ, in fact, they are
sure to differ. One's friendship for
the store is the result of finding good
values; another's is the result of effi
cient service and courteous treatment,
and so on.
Naturally this friendshiply feeling on
the part of our patrons is reciprocated
on our part. And this spirit of mutual
friendship is an impetus for greater
service and an incentive to ever-increasing
endeavor to make this store
a place where every visitor will feel
perfectly at home.

ARIZONA NOTES.
Items of Interest Culled From Our
Exchanges.
A state-wide reclamation cam
paign is soon to be started in
Arizona. The National Recla
mation Association has a branch
office in Phoenix preparing for
this work. Water enough goes
to waste each year in Arizona to
irrigate thousands upon thous
ands of acres of land. The great
task is to conserve this water
and to use it to make the desert
blossom.
Dr. Oscar G. Moline, quaran
tine inspector, Bureau of Animal
Industry, reports during the
month of May sixteen inspections
at the border ports of entry from
So'jora, totalling 25,000 head of
cattle. These cattle are allowed
to be imported after beinp: in
spected for diseases. The cattle
are being shipped to various
points in the United States, prin
cipally the northern states, for
feed i ng Cattleman.
The Clifton Copper Era says:
Attached to the incoming train
Sunday afternoon was a carload
of thoroughbred registered Here
ford bulls consigned to Mont
gomery & Hampton. The bulls
came from Kansas and everyone
was a thoroughbred and fine
looking animal. The shipment
was received by George Mont
gomery and after being shod
were driven out to the ranch of
Hampton & Montgomery.
Within six months, a brand
census of all the cattle in the
state must be taken by the own
ers and filed with the Live Stock
Sanitary board under the pro
visions of house bill No. 34, ap
proved February 24, 1919, to
amend chapter 3, title 30, of the
revised statutes of Arizona, 1913,
civil code, providing for the re
cording of all brands for live
stock, for cancellation of brands
in certain cases and for penal
ties for use in brands not re
corded.
The National Swine Growers'
Association is authority for the
statement that from January 1,
1916, to January 1, 1919, there
has been in increase of 15 per
cent of swine on farms of the
United States. Some states have
shown decreases and others in
creases. Arizona, in the face of
adverse feed conditions and com
peting with increased crop acre
ages of cotton, has shown the
greatest percentage of increase
of swine in the last three years
of any state in the union.
Charles Goetz of Benson states
that the work of rebuilding the
Benson smelter is about complet
ed and that it is hoped to blow
in the smelter within a few
weeks. The company has se
cured a contract on several
thousand tons of ore from the
Johnson district and from several
others on the lower San Pedro.
Mr. Goetz went east latfall and
interested capital in the smelter
and they have been busy for the
past few months putting the
plant in shape. Patagonian.
The recent bathing girls' par
ade at Phoenix has not received
official sanction for everyday
attire, and two precocious young
ladies who appeared in bathing
suits one very oppressive morn
ing got a sentence for thirty
days in jail. The judge who can
lay aside his official glasses one
day because there was a money
getting scheme on and refuse to
discern the sauxe on another
occasion ought to have accom
panied the culprits during their
incarceration. Arizona State
Miner.
ARIZONA LEADS.
The state of Arizona leads all
the states in the union for en
rollment in vocational home eco
nomics. In the Vocational Sum
mary, the organ of the federal
board of vocational education,
for the month of May, appeared
diagrams showing the standing
of the various states in the union
in enrollment per population in
vocational agriculture, vocation
al home economics, and the
trades and industries for the
year ending June 30, 1918. Utah
leads the country in agriculture,
and Arizona is eighth ahead of
agricultural states such as Ne
braska, Kansas, Indiana, Wis
consin. In the trades and in
dustries Arizona is sixteenth on
the list, leading thirty two other
states, among them being Cal
ifornia,and such industrial states
as New York,' New Hampshire
and Maryland. It is in the mat
ter of home economics that Ari
zona has outdid herself, for in
this particular branch she leads
all the states in the union,
It is a matter of particular
pride to Professoi I. Colodny,
state director of vocational edu
cation, that he has managed to
win for Arizona first place in
this great work. It was not
even expected that Arizona
would rank with California or
Massachusetts or New York, but
actually she has had enrollment
in her class rooms per popula
tion a greater number than these
states. This year, which is just
closing there were enrolled 1293
students in vocational work.
This is more than double the
number that was enrolled last
year.
ADVERTISING LAW.
The advertising of promoters
of various companies is likely to
undergo a revision in the direc
tion of mildness and explicit
truthfulness right soon, for the
new false advertising law is in
effect, and the corporation com
mission will "get them if they
don't watch out."
Part of the new law reads as
follows:
"No company, broker, or
agent, or any other person, shall
issue, circulate, or publish any
advertisement, pamphlet, pros
pectus, or circular concerning
any security sold or offered for
sale by it, unless the name of
the company, broker, agent, or
person issuing, circulating or
publishing the same shall be
su inscribed thereto, and a true
copy thereof shall have been
first filed in the office of the Cor
poration Commission, or deposit
ed in a United States postoffice,
properly ' enclosed in a sealed
envelope, addressed to the Com
mission at Phoenix, Arizona,
with the postage duly prepaid
thereon; nor shall any company,
broker, or agent, or any other
person, issue, circulate, or pub
lish any such advertisement,
pamphlet, prospectus, or cir
cular after notice in writing
given to it by the corporation
commission, that in its opinion,
the same contains any statement
that is false or misleading or
otherwise likely to deceive a
reader thereof."
NEW STATE DEPARTMENT.
I. P. Frazier, supervising state
engineer for the southern coun
ties of Arizona, was in Pata
gonia during the week and while
here made the statement that
work will soon commence on an
important piece of road con
struction which will extend from
Patagonia northward to the
Cochise county line. Mr. Fra
zier states that $150,000 of gov
ernment money has been ap
propriated for this work, which
will assure the building of a
100 foot boulevard over the en
tire route.
The present county road lead
ing from Patagonia toward the
Cochise county lin.e is but fifty
feet wide. However, at Mr.
Frazier's solicitation, Colonel R.
R. Richardson has generously
donated an additional fifty feet
along the entire distance front
ing on his real estate holdings,
approximately one and one-half
miles.
This new road will connect at
the Cochise line with the state
highway system and will of
necessity cause an increased
amount of travel through Pata
gonia toward Nogales. It will
be a pleasure to the owner of an
auto, a convenience to the far
mer. who can deliver his wares
to the Patagonia market at a re
duced cost, and will be a busi
ness builder of inestimable
value. And this highway can
not help but advance the price
of real estate along its entire
length, since nothing is more
conducive to the general welfare
and prosperity of any com
munity than good roads. Patagonian.
