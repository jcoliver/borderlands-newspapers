ARIZONA NOTES.
Items of Interest Culled From Our
Exchanges.
Two miles of the state high
way to the east of Douglas, in
the immediate vicinity of the
Silver Creek, bridge was com
pleted yesterday and thrown
open to traffic according to Roy
White, engineer in charge for
the highway commission, who
arrived in Douglas last night.
Geo. W. Crow, one of the best
known mining men in the south
west, who has been spending
some time in .Mexico, aQd who
was connected with the Alto
mines some twenty-five years
ago, is back again, and is look
ing into the old Pierce Gardner
property in the Harshaw dis
trict. Patagonian .
Once in a great while a surface
deposit of mineral is discovered
from which fortunes are recov
ered almost from the jrrass roots.
Such cases are exceptional how
ever, and furnish no logical pre
cedent which should govern re
gular mining operations, for it
is a well known fact that "mines
are made," and not found.
As an evidence of the rapid
strides made by Cochise county
in the agricultural and cattle
lines of industry, the records of
Cochise county of patents grant
ed to land owners, are a glowing
argument. Since the 8th day of
August and up to and including
the 15th day of October, sixty
six patents have been filed with
the recorder.
The state of Arizona was made
richer yesterday to the extent
of $171,928 80, .which amount
was received in a warrant from
the treasury department at
Washington and represents the
receipts from the national for
ests within this state for the
fiscal year ending June 30, 1919.
The authority for this payment
is found in the act of congress
approved May 25, 1908, making
appropriations for the depart
ment of agriculture for the fiscal
year ending June 30, 1908.
THE ROOSEVELT MEMORIAL.
We unqualifiedly endorse the
idea of a memorial to the late
Colonel Roosevelt. However,
much his fellow citizens may
have differed from him on polit
ical issues, they admit that he
was a great man and a great
American too great to belong
to New York or to the Repub
lican party. The Roosevelt me
morial association is appealing
to all classes of citizens for help
in this movement, says The Tuc
son Post.
It is easy to critise the action
of any great man. While living,
they all make their enemies.
But the American people are big
enough to rise above little petty
politics and do honor to the me
mory of a great American.
The following from Hermann
Hagerdon portrays the charac
teristics that make the memory
of Theodore Roosevelt dear to
the American people:
"He was found faithful over a
few things and he was made
ruler over many; he cut his own
trail clean and straight and mil
lions followed him toward the
light. He was frail he made
himself a tower of strength. He
was timid; he made himself a
lion of courage. He was a
dreamer; he became one of the
great doers of all time. Men
put their trust in him; women
found a champion in him; kings
stood in awe of him, but chil
dren made him their playmate.
He broke a nation's slumber
with his cry, and it rose up. He
touched the eyes of blind men
with a fiame that gave them
vision. Souls became swords
through him; swords became
servants of God. He was loyal
to his country and he exacted
loyalty; he loved many lands,
but he loved his own land best.
He was terrible in battle, but
tender to the weak; joyous and
tireless, being free from self
pity ; clean with a cleanness that
cleansed the air like a gale. His
courtesy knew no wealth, no
class; his friendship, no creed or
color or race. Hi3 courage stood
every onslaught of savage beast
and ruthless man, of loneliness,
of victory, of defeat. His mind
was eager, his heart was true,
his body and spirit, defiant of
obstacles, ready to meet what
might come. He fought injus
tice and tyranny; bore sorrow
gallantly; loved all nature, bleak
spaces and hardy companions,
hazardous adventure and the
zest of battle. Wherever he
went he carried his own pack;
and in the uttermost parts of the
earth he kept his conscience for
his guide."

WILL YOU HELP OR HINDER?
Superintendent G. H. Madden Presents
Reasons for Voting "Yes" Today.
In view of the fact that the
board of trustees of school dis
trict number one has called a
bond election for $85,000, the
public is entitled to know how
this money is to be spent and
something of the needs that con
front the public schools of No
gales.
The Elm street building will
be completed, two additional
rooms built on and a heating
plant installed. A site in the
northern portion of the city will
be purchased and a building of
at least twelve rooms erected
and equipped.
As the Elm street building
now stands it is little more than
mere barracks. The walls, both
inside and outside, have not been
plastered and no finish wood
work put in. The rooms have no
ceilings. There is , no heating
plant in the building and with
out ceilings the rooms are un
comfortable in winter and very
unattractive at all times. The
exterior of the building will be
completed so as to make it an
attractive building.
Few people know that nearly
500 children are daily in attend
ance at Elm street building. As
there are only 8 rooms this
means that most of the rooms
are used for half day sessions
one group of children attending
in the forenoon and another
group in the afternoon. Even
with this arrangement some of
the rooms have more than 45
pupils. It is impossible for teach
ers to handle this number of
children in the primary grades
and get satisfactory results with
an all-day session. They get
still poorer results with the half
day session. Pupils who are at
tending only a half-day cannot
possibly complete the year's
work and must continue the
work of the same grade next
year until they have completed
the work of that grade. If the
bond election should fail and we
cannot relieve this crowded con
dition it will no doubt mean
that the half day session will be
extended to the higher grades.
This may come before the end
of the present year, as it is bet
ter to alternate the half day ses
sion than to require that the
lower grades shall be the suffer
ers all the time. They suffered
from the half-day session last
year. If your son or daughter,
in the fourth, fifth, or sixth
grade is allowed to attend school
only a half day and will not be
able to complete the work of his
grade and a large portion of next
year will be required to finish
the grade that should have been
finished this year, you will have
no one but yourself to blame if
you do not support this bond
issue and give your own, as
well as other children, a fair
chance to make their grades.
Because of the failure of the
school bond election in Tucson
last spring the half day session
has been found necessary in the
high school. The upper class
men are attending only half day.
Not only do we find this crowd
ed condition in the Elm street
school but it exists also in the
High School building. The din
ing room of the cooking depart
ment has had to Rive way to a
group of grade pupils and the
chemistry laboratory as well as
the auditorium is now used for
class recitation. The art room
has had to go. This year the
increase in the high school re
quired us to send one of the
grades to the Elm street school
and another must go next year as
two divisions of the sixth grade
will be promoted to the Junior
High school, necessitating at
least one additional class room.
To relieve this congestion and
give ample room for the proper
kind of work throughout the
school, a building of at least
twelve rooms is needed, built so
that additional rooms may be
added later. The tax-payers of
the district would not be asked
at this time to further burden
themselves with bonded indebt
edness if it were not absolutely
necessary to give relief to the
conditions that already exist. In
its growing, expanding condi
tion, Nogales cannot afford to
neglect its schools. As the city
grows it is evident that the pub
lie schools will grow and expand
and more room be necessary.
One of the bluest and most im
portant assets of any town or
city is its public school system.
The public schools of a munici
pality are an index to the char
acter of the people of that mu
nicipality. Each individual voter
will help to write the character
of Nogales next Saturday at the
polls. The Nogales public schools
must have relief. Will you help
or hinder?
G H. Madden.
THE PRESIDENT'S GIFTS.
As estimated in the gossip of
the Republican cloak rooms of
Congress, the gifts received by
President Wilson from the rulers
and people of Europe were worth
any sum between a vague "half
a million" and a more indefinite
"several millions" of dollars.
This immense valuation was
placed on them by the partisans
not as a measure of President
Wilson's popularity in Europe
but as a spur to criticism of him
at home.
Now the truth is revealed in
the official list of the gifts and
appraisement of their value
which intrinsically is rather
small. It discloses that the Re
publican critics, including Sen
ator Sherman and Represent
ative Rodenberg, were as far
from right in their guesses on
this subject as they usually are
in respect to other statements.
The presents are neither so cost
ly as the orators declared nor
yet so cheap as these gentlemen
must feel after having got the
facts against their will.

Common-Sense for
Corns, "6ets-!t"
The Great Painless Corn Loosener.
Simple as A. B. C. Never Fails.
If you have ever tried to get rid
of a corn by bundling' up your toe
with bandag.ee, or by using calve
that made your toe red and almost
raw, or tried to drag your Corn out
with a. knife, there will bo a. Bur
prise waiting for you when you use
"Gete-It." Imagine peeling your corn
off gloriously, easily and painlessly.
Just like peeling off a. banana ekin.
Well, that is what happens when
you use "Gets-It." There Is nothing
else that will give you this same
result. Millions of folks have had
the same blessed experience. Why
putter and suffer, limp, and spoil s
good time for yourself and your
friends, or your peace of mind while
trying to attend to business? Use
'Gets-It," the simple common-sense way.
"Gets-It," the onlysure, guaranteed,
money-back corn-remover, costs but
a trifle at any drug store. MTd by

A PROCLAMATION
Designating Monday, October 27th,
1919, as Roosevelt Day.
In listing great Americans,
the nation and the world have
given high place to the name of
Theodore Roosevelt. The purity
of his life, his devotion to the
land of his birth, and hign ideals
he followed as well as advocat
ed, and the services, both civil
and military, which he whole
hearted ly rendered his fellow
men have all buen considered in
according to him the rightful
title, "Theodore Roosevelt,
American. "
As long as the State of Ari
zona shall have existence the
memory of Theodore Roosevelt
will endure in the hearts of its
people, for here especially be
will be remembered through
that greatest of all reclamation
works, the Roosevelt Project,
which created an empire from
the desert and was possible only
because of hit, effective influence
at a critical time. This rugged
monument, no mere statue or
work of art in bronze or marble,
is tipical of the man whose
name it bears; a fountain of
good to the people, a direct ben
efactor to thousands of homes.
It is such a monument as he
would have wished and within
a state made doubly dear to him
as the home of many of that
gallant regiment that followed
him on Cuban battlefields.
The Nation at large has now
undertaken to honor the memory
of the hero who has passed.
The Roosevelt Memorial Asso
ciation has been formed, open to
the membership of all patriotic
Americans, to secure for pos
terity the Roosevelt Home at
Oyster Bay and make it a shrine
of Americanism as Mount Ver
non has been, since the time
of George Washington, the Mec
ca of countless patriotic pil
grims, and to erect at the Na
tion's capital a memorial of last
ing sort and of public utility.
In this memorial Arizona must
have no small part and in every
community it is hoped that the
Association Membership Cam
paign will be actively conducted
from October 20th to 27th, with
especial participation by the
schools and churches. It is con
sidered particularly fitting that
the last day of the campaign
should be set aside for public
observance.
Now Therefore, I, Thomas E.
Campbell, Governor of Arizona,
by virtue of the authority vest
ed in me by law, do hereby set
aside Monday, October 27th,
1919, as Roosevelt Day, and do
request and urge that on that
day every effort be put forth to
insure the success of the Memo
rial Campaign, and that on the
evening of such day there be
held public assemblies at which
the especial subject shall be,
"The Americanism of Theodore
Roosevelt."
In Witness Whereof, I have
hereunto set my hand and caus
ed the Great Seal of the State of
Arizona to be affixed.
Done at Phoenix, the Capitol,
this 18th day of October, 1919.

Attest: Governor.

State Road Work.
Wiley E. Jones, attorney gen
eral of Arizona has written an
opinion citing the law governing

thorizes you to let "state high
way contracts" for the "con
struction of any state highway

your option, is found in para
graph 5124, Revised Statutes of
Arizona, 1913, and reads as fol
lows: "5124. Upon the adoption by
the board of control or the board
of supervisors, under whose di
rections the work is to be done,
of the plans and specifications
for the construction of any state
highway or bridge, or extension
thereof, it shall be optional with
the board of control or board of
supervisors, as the case may be,
to have any or all work provided
for by this act done either by

tem. In case the work is to be
done by contract, it shall be the
duty of the said board of con
trol, or board of supervisors, to
advertise in a newspaper pub
lished in such county, where the
proposed work is located, for
sealed proposals for the doing
of such work. Such notice shall
be given for at least thirty days
prior to the opening 6f such
sealed proposals, which shall be
directed to the said board of
control, or the board of super
visors as the case may be, and
marked "state highway con
tract." Upon the opening of
such proposals, the contract for
the work shall be let to the
lowest -responsible bidder; pro
vided, however, that the said
board of control, or board of su
pervisors shall have the right to
reject any and all bids and may
proceed to construct said work
under their own supervision,
without contract. In case the
contract is awarded, as herein
provided, the successful bidder
shall enter into such a contract
with the State of Arizona, or the
county in which the work is to
be done, as may be prescribed
by the said board of control or
the board of supervisors, a copy
of which shall accompany the
plans and specifications. The
successful bidder shall also file
with the said board of control,
or the board of supervisors, a
good and sufficient bond, pay
able to the State of Arizona, or
to the county in a sum not less
than twenty five per cent of the
contract price of said work, con
ditioned upon the failhful per
formance of said contract."

LIVER DIDN'T ACT
DIGESTION WAS BAD
Says 65 year Old Kentucky Lady, Who Tells How She Was RcEevec)
After a Few Doses of Black-Draught.
Mcadorsvllle, Ky. Mrs. Cynthia
Higgineotham, of this town, Eays: "At
ray age. which is 65, the llrer does
not act so well as when young. A few
j-enrs ago, ray stomach was all out of
fix. I was constipated, my liver
didn't act. My digestion was bad, and
It took so little to upset me. My ap
petite was cone. I was very weak...
I decided I would give Black
Draught a thorough trial as I knew it
-a?as highly recommended for this
-rouble. I began taking it. I felt
-otter after a few doses. My appetite
mproved and I became stronger. My
owels acted naturally and the least
.Dublc was soon rishtod with a few
doses of Black-Draught."
Seventy years of successful use has
made Thedford's Black-DrauKht a
standard, household remedy. Every
member, of every family, at times,
need the help that Black-Draught can
give in cleansing the system and re
lieving the troubles that come from
constipation, indigestion, lazy liver,
etc. You cannot keep well unless your
stomach, liver and bowels are in good
working order. Keep them that way.
Try Black-Draught. It acts promptly,
gently and In a natural way. If you
feel sluggish, take a dose tonight.
You will feel fresh tomorrow. Prico
