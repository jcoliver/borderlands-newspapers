, cient service and courteous treatment,

the part of our patrons is reciprocated
on our part. And this spirit of mutual
friendship is an impetus for greater
service and an incentive to ever-increasing

ARIZONA NOTES.
Items of Interest Culled From Our
Exchanges.
A serious obstacle to the sale
of Maricopa county's $4,000,000
highway bond issue has arisen
in the form of objections on the
part of attorneys for the bond
buyers to accept the bonds by
reason of their expressed belief
that the bond election, held May
17, last, was not in accordance
with the state constitution.
Cochise county ranks second
in population in Arizona at the
present time, according to an
estimate issued by Secretary V.
A. Wood of the state tax com
mission at Phoenix. The Co
chise figures are set at 58,219.
Maricopa county leads with 84,
519. The state population is
estimated at 398,952.
Frederic Bechdoldt, prominent
writer, whose stories of the
southwest attract the attention
of the millions of readers of the
Saturday Evening Post and who
was recently a sojourner in Tuc
son, has returned to his home at
Carmelby the sea, on the coast
of central California. With him
Mr. Bechdoldt carried sufficient
data of this section of Arizona to
produce a two part article, soon
to appear in the Post.
During the last few years the
Hope Natural Gas Co. and the
Peoples Natural Gas Co., both
of Pittsburg, Pa., have been
drilling deep wells in northern
West Virginia and southwestern
Pennsylvania to find deeper oil
bearing and gas bearing sands,
their object being to reach, if
possible, the horizon of the rich
Clinton sand of Ohio, which, ac
cording to Dr. I. C. White, the
State geologist of West Virginia,
should be found in this region at
depths between 7,000 and 8,000
feet.
The representation of no Ari
zona county in the lower house
of the legislature will be reduc
ed under the new legislative dis
tricting act, according to an
opinion recently transmitted by
Attorney General Wiley E.Jones
to James S. Goodwin of Tempe.
Press reports recently published
had stated that the counties of
Cochise, Graham, Greelee and
Yuma would each lose one mem
ber in the house of representa
tives under the operation of the
new law. This was denied by
Attorney General Jones.
CATTLEMEN ORGANIZE.
Permittees in the Tumacacori
district of the Coronada Na
tional forest organized at No
gales last Sunday afternoon,
and drew the lines taut on their
grazing areas and pledged them
selves as an organized associa
tion, to prevent illegal grazing.
Further, they pledged them
selves to support the movement
in the thirteen states of the
west to work for government
regulation of all grazing areas
of the public domain, says The
Arizona Cattleman.
The association was not form
ed without a long and heated
session, wherein the question of
grazing at all on the forest tracts
trembled in the balance because
the government had collected
damages for illegal grazing
which had resulted in crowding
the forage areas and injuring
the grass without materially
benefitting any of the permittees
and disorganizing the entire
grazing district.
The meeting was attended by
Supervisor Paul P. Pichlynn
and his assistant, Mr. Wales,
and by all the stockmen of the
district.
After everyone had discussed
the condition of affairs the stock
men decided to co operate with
the forest service, and the Tu
macacori Stockgrowers' Associa
tion was organized with Nonie
Bernard as president; Arthur
Noon as vice president; Harry J.
Saxon, secretary and treasurer,
and the selection of an advisory
board to co operate with the
forest service. This committee
consists of Nonie Bernard, Joe
Wise, Harry Saxon, Cy. Mar
steller and Phil Clark. A con
stitution and bylaws were adopt
ed And as sonn .a t.ho norm i Hodc
in the district are signed up the
association will be under way.
After the meeting Supervisor
Pichlynn and his assistant, Mr.
Wales, were the guests of the
stockmen at a broncho busting,
bull dogging and roping contest.
UNGRATEFUL AUTOISTS.
Autoists are supposed to be
very good-natured individuals,
always glad to help some one in
distress and genially inclined to
give weary pedestrians a "lift"
along the way. But either they
are becoming hardened to the
joys of motoring or there are
some who do not live up to their
reputation for courtesy, for com
plaints are some times heard of
ungrateful autoists.
One woman, living near a
favorite motor thoroughfare, says
that she has always until lately
been glad to help automobilists
who have had difficulties near
her home. But she has begun
to feel that her kindness is
wasted.
A driver came to her house
one evening and asked for a pair
of pliers. She loaned them read
ily. The man took them out to
his car, repaired the faulty part
and drove off with the pliers.
Another time an auto party stop
ped for lack of gasoline. The
called upon the woman and ask
ed if she had any. She handed
out a large jug containing the
necessary "gas." In this case
gasoline and jug both followed
the way of the pliers. The party
drove off without even offering
to pay for the material they ap
propriated. Another party came into her
yard for sticks of wood to help
in jacking up their car. She
allowed them to take cord wood
from a neat pile by her kitchen
door. When the repairs were
completed the party drove on,
leaving the sticks scattered over
the roadway.
Perhaps this woman has been
unfortunate in her experiences.
Nevertheless, these true stories
are worth meditating upon. Too
many people are inclined to
abuse kindness and to accept
favors without the gratitude and
courtesy which are so easily to
give and so pleasant to receive.

RE-CLASSIFY CATTLE BRANDS.
A monumental task is being
carried on in the office of the
State Live Stock Sanitary Board
according to Secretary Ed. W.
Stephens, in the recording of
brands all over the state, says
the Phoenix Gazette.
The work consists of record
ing all existing brands with a
record of their initial recording,
and subsequent transfers. The
difficulties attending the pro
cedure lie in the fact that many
brands have never been legally
transferred with the animals
sold, and that the bills of sale
in such cases do not include the
brand. Precaution must be
taken against recording brands
so similar that they may be mis
taken for each other, and in the
case of brands that may easily
be changed to look like another.
THE PROSPECTOR.
The prospector is the pioneer
who blazes the trail; he is the
one who explores and searches
for valuable minerals or ores in
hitherto unworked and untrod
den ground, and if his work is
not encouraged the production
of the precious metals will con
tinue to decline.
True, many of the world's
greatest mineral districts were
found by pure accident but the
work of the prospector develop
ed these discoveries.
When Marshall discovered that
gold nugget in the mill race of
Sutter's sawmill at Coloma, in
El Dorado county, Cal., he start
ed the greatest prospecting cam
paign the world has ever wit
nessed. Tonopah was discovered by
the straying away of Jim But
ler's burro. Divide and its won
derfully rich possibilities was
uncovered accidently by a cross
cut being run for the Gold Moun
tain vein. Patagonian.
STATE FAIR PREMIUM LIST.
Containing announcements of
a wealth of prize money far ex
ceeding all formei offers, the
1919 premium list of the Arizona
State Fair to be held at Phoenix
November 3 to 8, inclusive, is
now ready for distribution by
Shirley Christy, secretary of the
fair commission. All requests
for free copies should be ad
dressed to him, care of the fair
commission, at Phoenix.
The premium list covers a
wide range of exhibits for which
handsome cash prizes have been
offered. The competitions are
such that no one will be barred
from entering some one of the
contests for the range is so great
as to include every possible line
of endeavor from shirt making
to the exhibition of thorough
bred live stock.
The booklet also contains all
information concerning the me
thod and manner of making en
tries and the requirements in
each of the several classes, to
gether with much general infor
mation regarding the fair itself.
One cannot help being convinc
ed after a perusal of its contents
that the 1919 fair is going to be
of surpassing magnitude and re
plete with interests in every de
partment. Of especial interest are the
prizes to be offered and the ex
hibits planned for the women's
department, with special atten
tion paid to the subject of home
economics, science of the kitchen
and scientific home making, all
of which subjects are regarded
as of growing importance by the
thrifty housewives of Arizona.
The women's department will
be under the direction of Mrs.
W. W. McNeff, who urges that
no time should be lost by those
intending to make entries in
securing the premium lists, that
they may devote their spare
hours during the next 2 months
in the making and preparation
of their examples of handicraft.

various departments are an

ORE FROM MOWRY.
W. J. Mitchell, superintendent
of the Mowry and Consolidated
mines at Mowry, states that the
former mine will again resume
ore shipment as soon as the
roads are in better condition.
High grade ore from the Olive,
one of the claims belonging to
the Consolidated company, is
being sacked ready for shipment
to the smelters.
Conditions are rapidly improv
ing at Mowry, a force of seventy
men now being employed at the
two leading properties. More
miners are expected to be em
ployed at the El Paso soon. A
station is now being cut at the
300 foot level on this property,
from which point drifting on the
vein will begin.

chell's absence on the coast.
Grant Lewis was in charge of
the two leading Mowry prop
erties. Patagonian.
OUTLOOK AT MORNING GLORY
From present indications the
old Morning Glory mine is about
to come into its own again. Ia
the face of the 700 foot tunnel,
at a depth of 300 feet from the
surface, the showing all vbut
proves the existence of a large
body of rich copper ore, which
will no doubt be uncovered with
in the next few days. Samples
of rock carrying boronite and
calcocite were brought in from,
the mine during the week, and
as work progresses more of this
ore, apparently carrying better
values, is being found.
Under the competent manage
ment of J. C. Miller, the reor
ganized Morning Glory Mining
company some time ago began
an intelligent campaign of de
velopment on this well known
mine and those who are familiar
with the property predict that
the present work being done
must of necessity result in once
more placing the old mine on
the list of regular producers.
C. B. Wilson is the owner of
the property in question, which
is being worked under bond and
lease by the Morning Glory Min
ing company, a corporation fin
anced by Eastern capital. Pa

Ready for 1919-1920 Session.
The 1919 20, session of the
Nofjales Public Schools will open
next Tuesday morning, Sept. 2,
at 9 o'clock. All pupils should
report for enrollment promptly
at that hour to the rooms to
which they have been promoted.
Pupils who are new this year
should report to the Principal of
the Grammer School in the High
School Building if they are in
the third grade or above. Those
below the third grade school
report to the principal at the
Elm street school.
As the colored school building
is not ready Col. Carnahan has
consented to the use of the din
ing room of Anding Hall at the
camp for three or four weeks.
All pupils of the colored race
will report to their teacher at
this building.
It would be appreciated if the
people of the town who have
rooms to rent would notify me
at the office of the high school,
phone 317. It is very important
that our teachers have comfort
able rooms as no teacher can do
her best work unless she has a
good comfortable place to live.

TUMACACORI MISSION.
Three hundred dollars was
pledged last (Tuesday) night at
a meeting of the directors of the
Chamber of Commerce to the
National Park service for the
work on the restoration of the
Tumacacori mission, after the
directors had heard an interest
ing talk on the progress made
there from Prank Pinkley of the
National Park Service. Three
hundred dollars had already
been pledged by the Nogales
Chamber of Commerce. With
these pledges Mr. Pinkley ex
pects to secure an appropriation
of $800 from the National Park
Service toward the uncovering
of the ancient ruins, says Wed
nesday morning's Tucson Star.
At the meeting last night pic
tures were shown of the side
altars uncovered in the old
ruins. There are six of these
altars, indicating the import
ance of the mission, since none
of the California missions have
so many.

Nogales is infested with pro
fiteers according to a statement
made by Colonel Earl C. Carna
han, district commander. So
sincere is Coloael Carnahau in
his belief that he has closed his
camp for a period of two days
and will not allow his men to
enter the City of Nogales except
on urgent business. The Colonel
has also announced his inten
tion of establishing a truck line
to Tucson, where commodities
will be purchased for his com
mand. Merchants of Nogales, this is
a serious state of affairs. It
must be investigated. If there
are any profiteers in Nogales we
want to know who they are and
to ferret them out. This is a
matter which needs immediate
attention.
Establishing a truck line to
Tucson is a blow at the business
pride of Nogales; a soldier em
bargo on the business district
hurts.
Colonel Carnahan has accused
the City Council of "passing the
buck" and the Chamber of Com
merce of taking no interest in
the matter.
If there are profiteers in No
gales, who are they? The busi
ness reputation of Nogales is
jeopardized. Honest merchants
are forced to bear the burden
caused by dishonest ones.
The rebuke given by Colonel
Carnahan to the business men of
Nogales is being watched with
interest by our neighboring cities
and communities. To prevent
2500 men from entering the busi
ness district of Nogales is the
hardest financial blow the city
has ever received. It is up to
the Chamber of Commerce to
act. Nogales Herald.
Army and Navy Union Picnic.
The Service Men's celebration,
tomorrow and Monday, Labor
Day, at Potrero Canyon, north
west of Nogales about four
miles, is going to be a regular,
old fashioned picnic.
The picnic will be under the
auspices of the Nogales Army &
Navy Union, which has made
arrangements with the Border
Auto Service to carry passen
gers to the beautiful grove for
50 cents per person.
Ex Service men are coming
from Tucson and other towns in
the state, and a big crowd is
assured.
The picnic grounds are only
one quarter of a mile west of
The Willows on the Nogales
Tucson road, and three miles
north of Nogales.
Cowboy and other outdoor
sports are being arranged for,
and a rip, roaring good time is
in store for all who attend the
first annual picnic given by the
A. & N. Union of Nogales.
Mr. and Mrs. Otto Merkel of
San Francisco, who last week
conducted the Economy stove
demonstration at P. P. Rodri
guez' hardware store, departed
for their home last Monday,
greatly pleased with their visit
to Nogales. They stated that
the demonstration which ended
last Saturday, was a great suc
cess, thanks to the ladies of No
gales, who daily visited the big
hardware store on Grand Ave.,
and took advantanges of the
wonderful bargains offered by
Mr. Rodriguez.

she writes: "I had a
general breaking-down
of my health. I was in

very severe. A friend
to 1 me 1 had tried every

I am strong and well."

Do you feel weak, diz

give Cardui a trial? It
should surely do for you
what it has done for so
many thousands of other
