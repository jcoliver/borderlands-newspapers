During 1917 there was issued
by the secretary of state of Ari
zona 19762 auto licenses, which
brought into that office the npat
sum of $109,025. The' showing
is the best ever made by that
division of the secretary of state's
office. Other fees in connection
with the issuance of licenses
amounted to many thousands
more.
Dr. A. L.Tilton has been tran
sferred from Nogales to Colum.
bus, N. M., where he is in charge
of the medical department of
that camp. It is quite probable
that he will soon be transferred
to the1 front in Prance, as it has
been the policy of the war de
partment to develop all the sur
geons possible at the local can
tonments and then send them
across the big pond.
Elmer W. Coker, secretary of
the Pinal County Cattle Grow
er's Association passed through
Tucson last Monday on the way
to .Washington as a represent
ative of the Cattle Association to
meet department officials in re
ference to preventing sheep from
passing over the Apache trail to
the plains of Southern Pinal and
Northern Pima Counties. Mrs.
Coker accompanied him on(the
trip. Arizona Cattleman.
A petition has been presented
to the Sonora legislature, which
is in session, asking for the en
actment of laws restricting the
privileges of the Chinese in that
state. It points out that Chinese
merchants have in some towns
practically driven Mexican
tradesmen out of business, and
that Chinese laborers, where it
is permitted to employ them,
have been the cause of a reduc
tion in wages in many sections
of the state.
Col. Breen has announced that
the quota of drafted men in the
State of Arizona has been re
duced to the minimum. Instead
of fifteen per cent, or 517 to be
called, only 494 men will have
to go. This will leave only 16
men from Mohave county to fill
out instead of 31. The reason
for the revision of figures in
Arizona's draft is the recent
checking over of the men ac
credited to the State and now at
the various training camps.
Miner.
The report of the commission
er of the United States Land
Office shows that Arizona has
the greatest acreage of unsur
veyed land of any state in the
union, there being in round num
bers 15,000,000 acres. More than
6,000,000 acres of its vacant
public land is surveyed and open
to entry. The territory of Alas
ka has the greatest amount of
vacant land, there being over
230,000,000 acres, of which there
has only been 86,000,000 acres
surveyed.
The Salt River Valley Hog
Company has shipped 20,000
hogs to Kansas City this season.
We know of one Salt River man
who was in the hog business
over there years aga and when
he made a contract to sell hogs,
he always inserted in the con
tract a clause providing for the
hogs to be delivered on Sunday.
A buyer once asked this hog
man why he always wanted to
deliver on Sunday. His reply
was that he could get more hogs
on that day because his neigh
bors all went to church on the
Sabbath. If this gentlemen ever
becomes Governor of Arizona we
are going to tell his name. -Arizona

A WAR STORY FROM ARMENIA
AN EDITOR WARMS UP.
20,000 NURSES NEEDED.
With a continuance of the war,
in the next year at least 20,000
nurses will be needed in army
hospitals at home and abroad.
Of the 80,000 graduate nurses of
the country only 3,500 have so
far been assigned to army ser
vice, and of this number 1,500
are in France. An army nurse
must be a graduate of a training
school for nurses and must have
served for two years in a hos
pital. Nurses who prefer not to
have service abroad are not sent
away.
In April 1914, three months
before the assassination of the
Austrian crown prince, Germany
sent to Turkish - officials sealed
notices announcing that war had
begun and calling for mobiliza
tion. These were not to be dis
tributed to the people 'until Au
gust. A Turkish general, whose
reliability cannot be doubted
(educated in Berlin, by the way,)
boasted to Americans of this
forehandedness, and announced
with a knowing smile that he
meant to be ready to act effi
ciently when the time came
The time came soon enough.
Backed by German men and ap
proval, Turkish f rightfulness
went the Huns one better in giv
ing free rein to a hatred of the
Christian Armenian and Syrian
peoples who formed the best
element in the population of
Turkey. The number of Arrae
nians and Syrians who have lost
their lives is variously estimated
at from 1 to 2 million. The num
ber now homeless in Turkey, or
refugees who are; wholly de
pendent upon American charity
to keep them from starvation,
is conservatively estimated at 2
million. An American doctor
coming down the mountain side
from the Lebanon noticed in the
distance a throng of children
and wondered why so many were
gathered in ode place. Upon
coming near he discovered that
a camel had died by the road
side and these famished children
were in desperation picking the
last shreds of flesh from the
skeleton of the fallen beast.
Children eageriy picking grains
from the dung of animals have
beeome a common sight.
Gomer Davis, who lost a leg
' while fighting for the union do
I ing the civil war, now editor of
the Concordia, Kansas, "Kan-
san, a Republican paper, gets
"all het up" in the following
fashiou:
"There is a doctrine of philo
sophy called metempsychosis, or
transmigration of the soul the
souls of men after death, in that
philosophy, return to earth in
other bodies, whether brutes or
human. If that be true, and I
have a choice in the next cycle,
as between two types, I should
prefer to return in the form of a
lazy, leprous, lousy, yellow cur,
sore eyed and mangy, belong to
a demented, drunken Arkansas
nigger, pass the drowsy, dreary
days away under the back stoop
of my master's cabin, fighting
fleas and sneaking, snooping
about, killing sheep at eventide,
than to come back in semblance
and stature of a man with the
instincts of a copperhead, snarl
ing and backbiting the govern
ment, while the Huns have their
atrocious and bloody fingers at
the throat of my country."
Mohave County Boy Killed in Battle
"Over the top" in Prance has
claimed -another Mohave county
boy, and a mother in New Bruns
wick is mourning her great loss,
in which she has the sympathy
of many Mohaveites who knew
and loved the young fellow, says
the Mohave County Miner.
Prank Portmore, formerly of
Gold Road, was killed on the
9th of last April in the storm
ing of Vimy Ridge, news to that
effect having just been received
by J. Harry Knight, an old
time friend. Young Portmore
had enlisted in the 54th Bat
talion, made up of recruits from
British X3olumbia. It was this
regiment that bore the brunt of
that dashing assault on what
was thought to be an impregna
ble position by the Germans.
He died carrying the allies' colors
to one of the most glorious vie
tories of the world war. Every
man in that wonderful charge
and who fell, is to be envied,
not mourned, because he did in
one day more for the world and
humanity than he could have
possibly accomplished in a life
time of other usefullness.
But Prank Portmore will be
long remembered by every one
of his friends and his exploit
will be history as loug as hu
man sympathy warms the heart
of man.

The crop of potatoes gathered
in the United States in 1917 is
one of the greatest in the agri
cultural history of the country,
reaching the untold bulk of 453,
000,000,000 bushels, fully 200,
000,000.000 over that of 1916. It
will require three quarters of a
million cars to handle the crop.
The food board requires that
purchases must be made at the
nearest point of distribution, the
price being subject to fixture by
the commission.
GERMANS LOSING FIGHT SPIRIT
Invalid Canadian soldiers who
arrived recently in Arizona are
optimistic in their view of the
new British drive in France.
"We are beating the Germans
at every trick of the game," said
Sergeant Mayor James Smith of
the Sixteenth Canadian Scots,
and now stationed at Globe.
"The more often we beat them
the more discouraged they seem
to become. All the fighting
spirit they displayed three years
ago has been about knocked out
of them. Their heavy artillery
on which they builded such
hopes has been eclipsed by the
French and English guns."
"They are good long distance
fighters, but inferior at close
quarters," said Sergeant J. E.
Mitchell of the Seventy second
Seafortb Highlanders.
Sergeant Major Smith was
wounded three times in the
head and hand at the capture
of Sanctuary Wood. Sergeant
Mitchell was also hit three times,
but was not invalided home until
shell shock and rheumatic fever
combined to incapacitate him.
Prospector.
BEST. TIME TO BE 'BORN.
Dr. Marcelo Boldimi, one of
Italy's greatest scientists, work
ing with the Italian army, has
for years suspected that a man's
strength, height and initiative
depend far more than anyone
suspected upon the month in
which he was born. Doctor Bol
dimi has discovered that those
men born between January 1
and March 31 are stronger, taller
and superior in intelligence to
those, soldiers whose birthdays
fall in other months. By living
with the army, gaining its meas
urements and observing the
men individually, he says he has
demonstrated this to his com
plete satisfaction.
NOTICE TO STOCKHOLDERS.
FAMOUS TREE DYING.
A battle is going on for the
life of southern California's most
famous tree. After bearing the
first navel oranges ever grown
in the United States and being
parent to groves producing 67
million dollars worth of choice
fruit annually, the tree, which
is at Riverside, Catl., is believed
to be dying. Experts are mak
ing every effort to save the tree.
It was planted in 1873 by Mrs.
C. L. Tibbetts, who obtained it
from the government horticult
ural gardens at Washington. It
came originally from Bahia,
Brazil.
MEANING OF "SABOTAGE.
Sabotage is a French term de
lived from "sabot," meaning a
wooden shoe. French strikers
would throw their wooden shoes
into machinery, thus wrecking
it; and from that the term came
to be extended to apply to all
malicious damage doue to stop
production or interfere with industry.

Entered at the Post Office at No

Class Matter,
DECEMBER 29, 1917.
It begins to look like the sen
ate committee intends to camou
flage the La Follette matter.
JuSt is if nothing had hap
pened, Governor G. W. P. Hunt
is again doing business at the
old stand.
The wooden ship building pro
gram has been declared by Rear
Admiral Bowles, assistant gen
eral manager of the emergency
fleet corporation, a complete fail
ure. That was the opinion of
shipping experts and prominent
naval officers when the scheme
was first suggested.
With frijoles at a bit a pound j
the bean bag is automatically

It is the opinion of Rear Ad
miral Piske that the entire Ger
man fleet can be destroyed by
the American air fighters.
We should not lose sight of
the fact that the Arizona Cattle
Grower's Association will hold
its annual convention in Nogales
February 14th, 15th and 16 th.
There will be a "host" of them
here and every preparation
should be made early to receive
them in a manner befitting the
prosperous city of Nogales. The
average "cow man" is not hard
to entertain but he likes lots of
it--soaiething doing as every
minute fleets. The members of
the association deserve the best
that is in us.
THE TOMB OF ADAM.
Dimes and nickels are said to
be current as small change in
France. Thus it is; Uncle Sam's
money is good in any country.
With coal selling at $250 a ton
in that country we are still fur
tber reminded that "there's
something rotten in Denmark."
Pima county now claims to
have, near Pantano, a cave that
makes the Mammoth Cave of!
Kentucky look like a gopher
hole.
Gen. Otto Hell is an officer in
the German army. From the
reports reaching this country
we take it that he is in charge
of the whole works over there.
Billy Sunday, the evangelist,
says he will go to the front in
France. In that case he should
take with him a bible for his
own use and a reliable gun for

is a municipal market and the
"wedge" on Grand avenue, be
tween Crawford and Elm streets,
would be a splendid location for
it provided the arroyo be cover
ed over.
Canada and Australia voted
upon the question of .raising an
army by means of the draft, but
the United States took a.shorter
cut. In Canada the vot6 was
affirmative but in Australia the
proposition was defeated by a
heavy majority.
It may be all right in some
sections of the country to con
serve white flour by eating more
corn bread but here in the south
west where corn meal is nine
and ten cents a pound and white
flour only seven and seven and
a half cents a pound, it will be
seen that conservation is a little
expensive to say nothing of in
dividual taste.
General Allenbyof the British
army seems to be "removing the
Turks from the face of the earth
over in Palestine the Holy
Land. Before capturing Jeru
salem he took Hebron, said to
be the oldest city in the world.
Hebron is 20 miles southwest of
Jerusalem and historians and
hieroglyphists tell us it is the
"supposed" burial place of our
distinguished ancestor. Adam.
His tomb is not an elaborate af
fair. Indeed if all reports are
true it is not a tomb at all but
rather a neglected grave. How
ever, the late Mark Twain.while
gathering threads to weave into
bis first great book, "Innocents
Abroad," tells us that while at
Hebron he visited and "wept
over the tomb of his loved an
cestor." Twain evidently "took
a long shot" in this instance for
it is only the "supposed" tomb
of Adam. For all he or any of
us know, it might have been the
last resting place of some an
cient I. W. W. or "Slacker."
The people of Hebron do not
know themselves whether Adam
is buried in their midst. They
appear to be a poky lot; they do
not know whether the town has
10,000 inhabitants or 30,000.
Thtiy never take a census.
Hebron differs from Nogales
in many respects. If Nogales
had even a "supposed" tomb of
our departed ancestor, our Cham
ber of Commerce would get busy
and before "the robbins nest
again" would erect a monument
whose hammered copper dome
would extend far into the blue
empyrean, thus glorifying the
memory of our distinguished re
lative' All this would be done
if we had to call on the Santa
Cruz Club to pull off another car
nival in order to properly take
care of the financial end of. the
enterorise.

migration officials, but those go
ing into the interior of Mexico

not trying to go into Mexico.

"How soon will Chief Fowler
be in?" Asked a city dad yes
terday at the police station of a
new cop who was intently ex
amining a new pair of patented
hand cuffs. "In about half or
three quarters of an hour he
4ds between his home and the
office and I hear him coming
now, down by the electric light
plant," replied the n. c. without
taking his eyes off the official
"toy" in his bands.

Christmas Cheer for Soldiers.
The soldiers stationed at No
gales are a splendid body of
men. They compose the 35th In
fantry, a portion of the famous
10th Cavalry, a quartermaster's
corps and a medical corps. A
large majority of them are from
splendid American homes and it
is therefore not surprising that
the morale of the entire camp is
above the average for large
bodies of men. This has been
remarked scores of times by our
citizens and for some time it has
been a question among the best
families here to indicate to them
they are regarded as splendid
specimens of young American
manhood, such, as Nogales has
sent into the ranks in the dis
tant training camps. The pro
blem, however, was solved by
two young ladies of the city.
! Miss Maud McPherson and Miss
Lena Keyte, teachers in the
high school. They proposed
that during the Christmas holi
days the doois of the homes of
the city be thrown open to the
soldier boys and a cordial wel
come extended to all regardless
of rank. The idea met with
popular favor and the ladies all
got busy. Each named the num
ber they would entertain and
the scheme was worked out with
the regularity of clock work.
It was not so much a matter of
"eats," as the boys had the best
the country affords for their
holiday dinners, including all
the palatable scallops and em
broidery, but cordial greetings
and diversified amusements.
These were provided in the way
of vocal and instrumental music,
dancing, games and a great big,
unselfish welcome that came
from the heart and had no veneer.
Ot course there were fruits and
salads and delicious refresh
ments but the outstanding feat
ure was good cheer and God
bless you! And in many homes
the proud assurance, 1 my boy
is somewhere, wearing khaki
also!"
The entertainments began as
early as Friday of last week and
continued through most of this
week, but the greater number
occurred Christmas day and dur
ing the evening. So far as has
been ascertained the soldiers
enjoyed each and every effort to
entertain them.
So generally was the response
to the suggestion of the promot
ers of the plan that it .may be
the Vidette has not secured
the names of all who entertain
ed, but we have done our best in
the premises. These are the
names me have secured:

INTERNATIONAL MONUMENTS
The work of Henry P. Corbin
and Manuel Bancaleri, consult
ing engineers for the Joint In
ternational Boundary Commis
sion, is now completed and the
gentlemen have returned to their
respective stations, the former
at El Paso and the latter at
Mexico City. Their work here
has been principally between
monuments 117 and 124. On the
west bank of the Santa Cruz
river they replaced monument
118, which had been washed
away. Right along the line here
in Nogales they have put in
three new monuments between
122 and 123. designated respec
tively A-122, B 122, and C-122.
Between 123 and 124 they have
put in two new ones, designated
respectively A-123 and B 123.
And all of the monuments from
117 to 124, inclusive, have been
repainted both the old ones and
those newly established.
Mr. Corbin stated that he
would shortly go to Yuma to in
vestigate the probable necessity
for a new survey, where the
Colorado river which is the
boundary line for some distance,
has changed its channel making
the line uncertain for about thir
ty miles.
There was a warmly contested
foot ball game on the parade
ground of the 35th Infantry
Christmas day between the E
company team and a picked team
from other companies of the re
giment. The former won by a
score of 12 to 0. So vigorous
was the contest that two of the
players went to the hospital for
repairs. "One of the

CLEARS UP POINT IN LAW.
Owing to the bewildering ram
ifications of the federal food law
and the licensing system which
has been inaugurated in connec
tion more or less confusion has
arisen in the minds of Arizona
merchants as to its application.
Some of the most misunder
stood points have been cleared
up by Timothy A Rioidan, fed
eral food administrator for Ari
zona, as follows:
"In the first place, it should
be understood," he said, "that
the rules and regulations for
persons or firms subject to
license do not apply to export
sales but they do include sales
to persons within the United
States, even though the pur
chaser is an exporter. In. this
connection it should be remem
bered that there is an embargo
on food to Mexico and in cases
where export licenses are ne
cessary, applications for them
shoald be made to the War Trade
Board or to the proper repre
sentative at the particular port.
"Mixed poultry feeds does not
come under the head of licensed
commodities in so far as the dis
tributor is concerned, but in this
connection it should be noted
that the use of wheat that is fit
for human consumption and the
use of any wheat in excess of
ten per cent in poultry feed is
prohibited. Anyone manufactur
ing such a product in which
wheat or rye occurs must be
licensed.
"All retailers are subject to
the various provisions of the
food administration act with the
exception that those doing a
business of $100,000 a year or
less in food commodities are not
required to be licensed. They
must, however, observe all other
provisions of the act.
"One corporation or partner
ship having various branches
doing business under the same
name but one license number
and this should be used on docu
ments that go to persons outside
of the organization of the licenses."

Many thousands ol
women suffering from
womanly trouble, have
been benefited by the use
of Cardui, the woman's
tonic, according to letters
we receive, similar to this
one from Mrs. Z. V. Spell,
ofHayne. N.C. "I could
not stand on my feet, and
just suffered terribly,"
she says. "As my suf
fering was so great, and
he had tried other reme
dies, Dr. had us
get Cardui. . . I began
improving, and it cured
me. I know, and my
doctor knows, what Car
dui did for me, for my
nerves and healih were
ftbout gone."
TAKE
The Woman's Tonic
She writes turthen ' I
am in splendid health . . .
can do my work. I feel I
owe it to Cardui, for I was
in dreadful condition."
If you are nervous, run
down and weak, or suffer
from headache, backache,
etc., every month, try
Cardui. Thousands of
women praise this medi
cine for the good it has
done them, and many
physicians who have used
Cardui successfully with
their women patients, for
years, endorse this medi
cine. Think what it means
to be in splendid health,
like Mrs. Spell. Give
Cardui a trial.
