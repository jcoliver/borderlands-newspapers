ARIZONA NOTES.
Items of Interest Culled From Our
Exchanges.
The state corporation commis
sion will probably issue an order
within the next two weeks for
a sleeper on the night trains be
tween Douglas and Phoenix, as
the resultof a vigorous campaign
conducted by the Warren Dis
trict Commercial club, the Doug
las Chamber of Commerce and
other organizations.
Governor Campbell has signed
the anti tobacco bill which raises
the age limit from 18 to 21. The
bill also strengthens the exist
ing law further by making it a
misdemeanor for a. minor to
purchase, receive or accept to
bacco, cigarettes, cigars, or to
bacco in any form, and the same
penalties which apply to the sell
er apply equally to the purchas
er. Even the giving of cigarette
papers to minors is forbidden.
It looks as though we may
have trying times in this country.
In the mean time keep your head
cool and your mouth shut. Don't
get into loolish arguments with
your neighbor who doesn't hap
pen to believe exactly as you do.
Forget that you are a republican-
democrat, a bull mooser or any
thing else and stand by the pre
sident and your country. That's
the only receipt for being a pa
triotic citizen. Buckeyen News.
Warning against purchasing
the stock of any company sell
ing stock without a permit from
the Arizona corporation commis
sion has been issued by that
body, which has recently receiv
ed information to the effect, that
a number of companies are violat
ing the law in this particular.
It is probable that active steps
will be taken by the commission
to prosecute those companies
which have been found to be
violating the law.
A Road bond issue of $100,000
for Pinal county is being plann
ed. Only the absence of Super
visor Bourne deterred action on
the matter at the last meeting of
the county supervisors. Chair
man Wills, and Supervisor Schill
ing have canvassed their sec
tions of the county and ficd sen
timent very much in favor of
the proposal. It is pointed out
that it will require this amount
to complete the road work in the
county now under way.
Lorenzo Wright Saturday en
tered into partnership with Will
Goodman, of the St. David coun
try, in the purchase of 14 head
of cattle from the Camou cattle
ranches of Sonora, and the new
firm has secured a range on the
boundary of Cochise and Santa
Cruz counties. Bert Polley
bought 73 head at the same time
which he will graze uear Here
ford, and Joe Downs bought 50
head to be placed on his land in
the Sulphur Springs valley.
The cattle industry is prosper
ing, and stock owners expect
1917 to be a banner year. Pros

While riding the range for
cattle in the mountains near
Picacho a few weeks ago Henry
Richenbach found an Indian re
lic that is highly prized.. It is a
stone receptical shaped from
grey granite and has a rattle
snake sewed about it poised
ready to strike an imaginary foe.
The receptical is one that might
be used for a pin tray or match
box, but just what purpose it
may have served in Indian do
mesticity is not apparent. Gover
nor Campbell saw the relic when
be was over here a couple of
weeks ago and offered ten dollars
lor it. Florence Blade.
Next to the Roosevelt dam,
the state fair is the biggest per
manent asset of Phoenix and the
Salt River valley. There will
be a fair held whether there is
an appropriation or not. I3ut
with a reasonable fund to draw
from the event will be greater;
besides all Arizona justly takes
pride in the state fair where all
the products and resources of
the state have equal chance for
display. Maricopa was the first
county in the state to hold a fair.
The county is still able to make
the best display in the state but
it requires all Arizona to make a
real state fair. Messenger.

Governor Cambell but reflect
ed the sentiment of the people
of Arizona when he said, in re
ply to a query from the semi
official New York World, that
Arizona stands ready to support

navy, to the full extent of its
resources in men and wealth.
A new artesian well flowing at

Heber Martin on the 15 acre
tract of Mr. J. A. Gumm, adjoin
ing the G. C. Woods place, on
the north side of town. Mr.
Gumm expects to build upon the
place in the near future, and
thinks this well will furnish
water sufficient to irrigate the

Capt. John H. Cady, famous
pioneer and author of Ariz
ona's Yesterday" expects to leave
Patagonia some time next week
for an extended trip, in the in
terest of his book. He will first
go to Tucson for a few days,
where he will hold a consulta
tion with Prof. Forbes, who
colloberated with him in the
preparation and financing of the
Publication of the book, and
from there he will go to the Coast.
Returning he intends to go to El
Paso and gradually work back
East, to attend all of the old
soldiers' reunions in different
states this summer. The captain
expects to spend considerable
time ifc the state of Ohio, his
native state, where he has re
latives. May good luck always
attend the oldtirner, is the wish
of his Patagonia friends. Pata

It was not merely the lure of
the camp, the witchery of a
night spent on the desert, that
brought the party from the
University of Arizona to the
Casa Grande Ruins last Satur
day. The expedition was head
ed by Dr. Cummings, Professor
of Archaelogy in the University,
and president of the Arizona
Archaelogy Society; and in his
informal talk, given by the camp
fire that night he tounched the
key-note of his purpose. He is
not only an enthusiastic delver
into the relics of the remote
past, and a zealous teacher of
his subject, but a sufficiently
loyal Arizonian to be directing a
movement to keep Arizona's
treasurers here. And it is only
by arousing in the people of this
state a real appreciation of the
value of these ruins and a desire
to further independent research
that the United States govern
ment can be withheld from
carrying off to the Smithsonian
Institute at Washington all the
treasured memorials which are
by right Arizona's own. Blade
Tribune. The El Paso Chamber of Com
merce business excursion to
principal points in New Mexico
and Arizona is scheduled to ar
rive in Patagonia at about 7
o'clock in the morning of Friday,
March 23. The business men of
El Paso will spend a little over a
week on the trip, and a special
train of seven cars will haul them
over the route. The party will
be composed of 75 of the leading
business men of the Pass City,
and the trip is undertaken as
and advertising scheme. The
presence of the well-to do citi
zens of the hustling Texas city
in Patagonia should also be
taken advantage of to do a little
home advertising, most of the
members of the party have made
money in mining. Some sort of
organized effort should, and
probably will be made, to greet
the visitors with a mineral dis
play, or let them known in some
manner of the great mineral re
sources of the Patagonia coun
try. The excursion will be in
Patagonia only a short time,
and from here will go to Noga
les. Pata gonian.
ARIZONA GREAT IN COPPER.
Fasily Leads Any Other S;a'e as Red
Metal Producer.
In 1907 Arizona forged ahead
of Moutana as the greatest cop
per producer. Since that time
she has been sending out great
er and greater quantities of cop
per until at present she is pro
ducing about 35 per cent of the
copper mined in the U. S.,
says Arizona Copper Camp.
The metal output from mines
in Arizona in 1916 had a record
total value of nearly 203,000,000
compared with $90,806,346 for
1915, according to the estimate
of Victor C. Heikes, of the Unit
ed States Geological Survey,
Department of the Iuterior.
The notable output of copper
and the high prices of metals
both assisted in this increase of
123 per cent.
The predominant metal in
Arizona is copper, the mine
output of which surpassed all
previous records and estimates,
as it increased from 459.972,295
pounds in 1915, to apDroximately
693,000,000 pounds in 1916. The
value of the output, on account
of the unusual market, increased
from 80,495,152 to nearly 190.
000,000. The increase of 135
per cent in the value of copper
alone in Arizona was therefore
more than the value of the total
output of the state in the previ
ous year. All the smelting plants
of the state were worked at full
capacity and made much greater
shipments of copper bullion.
Associated with the red metal
as by-products are gold and silver
and as a result of the increased
copper output the production of
gold from copper ores in most
counties was naturally greater
and increased from 4,166,025 in
1915 to approximately, 4,427,000
in 1916, an increase of over 4 per
cent.
The production of silver from
the mines increased from 5,649,-
020 ounces in 1915 to a record
output of about 6,823,000 ounces
in 1916. As the market price
was much higher the value in
creased from 2,864,053 to nearly
per cent in value. There was no
great change in the production
from the Commonwealth proper
ty, which is principally a silver
producer, so the increase is to
be credited largerly to the re
markable output of copper ore.
Arizona's nearest competitor
was Montana with a production
of 353,547,696 pounds of copper,
while Michigan is third with
269,888,710 pounds, consequent
ly Arizona produced more cop
per in 1916 than Montana and
Michigan combined, which is
taking quite a hike when it is
remembered that the latter states
formerly each held the lead.
There was more new capital
invested, more mines developed
and greater general activity in
Arizona than in any other copper
producing section of the world
during the year.
HAY SHORTAGE IS THREATENED.
According to A. B. Ming, coun
ty assessor, who has been well
over at least one half the Yuma
valley in his work listing prop
erty, hundreds of acres of alfalfa
lands are being plowed up by
the farmers for planting to cot
ton. "I am surprised," he said,
"for if the destruction of alfalfa
fields continues over the entire
valley to the extent I have no
ticed, there will be a serious hay
shortage in Yuma and this whole
country. It means an increase
in price and hay is already sell
ing for 18 and 20 per ton.
Yuma is the central market for
the mining country for many
miles around, and the consump
tion of hay from this market is
great. But what are the people
to do if the farmers plow up their
hay lands and curtail the supply
as it seems probable now? What
are the farmers themselves to
do? It simply means a shortage
that will be extremely hard to
meet. If people have to import
hay it will be so high in price
they can't feed it to stock at a
profit. I regard the situation as
alarming, add think something
should be said about it, as it is
not probable the farmers them
selves realize the situation."

TIME TO BECOME AMERICANS.
Miss Frances Keller, from an
experts knowledge of the immi
grant problem, has entered her
earnest plea for the absolute
domestication, in spirit as well
as in the flesh, of those who
come to America from beyond
the seas to take their places by
the side of the toiling masses in
manifold establishments. We
want no merely titular Ameri
cans in this crisis. We want no
citizens whose allegiance is to
the pay envelope, whose hearts
are not included in the baggage
that disembarked with them at
the New World's threshold. This
country would be poor indeed if
its doors were closed to the poor,
and from every land elements of
strength and robustness of fiber
have entered our national life,
often, under an original aspect
that was far from prepossessing.
Today America has need of those
who are not content with the
mere lip profession of patriotism.
The only justifiable hyphenates
are the all-Americans.
MAY DIVIDE COCHISE.
It begins to look like Cochise
county may be divided by the
creation of a new one which will
take away almost the north half
of the old county. The people
of northern Cochise county, led
by Willcox, have been desiring
and frequently asking for a new
county ever since the creation
of Graham and Cochise counties
in the year 1881. Two years
ago the legislature enacted a
law by which county division
may be accomplished by the
people who desire it with a par
tial consent of the entire county
from which the proposed new
county is to be taken.
The new county now proposed
by the citizons of Willcox and
other sections of northern Co
chise would contain almost half
the present area of Cochise coun
ty and would take away about
fifteen millions of taxable prop
erty, leaving practically one
hundred million, according to
claims of the Willcox people.

Work on the army cantonment
in Yuma will not be commenced
as soon as was expected. In
fact, it has been stopped where
already begun, namely, in
Douglas. The supposed reason
is that in sending the state troops
home there must be a redistribu
tion of regular troops along the
border, and their status must be
more definitely settled before
cantonment work proceeds. For
ty thousand dollars have been
appropriated fur this work in
Yuma. - -Sun . &ltc Pottle Cidcttr

"A SPLENDID DEMOCRAT." -
Mrs. George B. Marsh Honored by
Fellow Democrats.
The following letter was re
ceived by the press of Nogales,
last Thursday, from Mrs. George
B. Marsh, Santa Cruz county's
popular able representative in
the state legislature:
To the Editor:
The 'Lady from Santa Cruz'
has today been tendered a very
marked compliment from mem
bers of the Senate and House of
the Third Legislature of the
State of Arizona. It is in the
form of a very handsome bouquet
with a card attached which rea-ds:
From Admiring Democrats
to a
Splendid Democrat.
I wish to share the pleasure
which the approval of my fellow
legislators afford me, with my
Santa Cruz County friends and
therefore ask you that this item
be given space in your paper.
Yours truly,
Mrs. Geo. B. Marsh.
P. S. I do not send this letter
in a boastful mood but that you
may know that the lady repre
sentative has stood her ground
and represented the principles
of the platform on which she
was elected.
SOLDIERS QUARANTINED.
On account of the many deaths
of Alabama guardsmen lately,
division headquarters last Thurs
day ordered that the guardsmen
be again quarantined. In future,
or until further notice, no Ala
bama soldiers will be allowed to
leave camp after seven o'clock
at night.
This action is expecte'd to im
prove health conditions at the
camp which have, in the last ten
days, been very bad. Before
when there was much sickness
among the troops such a quar
antine was put in effect and soon
after conditions became better.
Officers claim that the guards
men are careless about taking
care of their health and it is
difficult to keep them wearing
their overcoats after nightfall,
when the temperature is con
siderably lower than in the day
time.
The prevalence of
among the Alabama

GOING BACK HOME.
As a result of the official note
recently addressed to Mexican
Consul Jose H. Delgado, by the
secretary of foreign relations of
the Carranza government, many
Mexicans who for some time
past have refrained from cross
ing the international line, have
secured passports and returned
to Mexico.
The official note from the
Secretary said:
"From this date and until fur
ther notice, you will extend to all
persons, whether Mexicans or
foreigners, wishing to come into
this Republic, a passport which
they must produce at the port
where they come through. You
will therefore give this disposi
tion due publicity so that it will
reach the ear of interested
parties."

Wednesday in this city the
annual conference of the Meth
odist Pacific Mexican Mission,
which was presided over by
Bishop Denny of Virginia, con
venced. The conference is at
tended by preachers from dif
ferent stations in Sinaloa, Sono

pointments for the ensuing year.
Everybody cordially invited to
attend.
General Jose J. Obregon, can
didate for governor of Socora,
and Miss Angel Murillo, a
charming society lady of Ala
mos, Sonora, were married last
Wednesday evening at the No
gales, Arizona Catholic church,
the ceremony being performed
in the presence of a large num
ber of friends of the high con
tracting parties. Thursday the
general and his bride departed
for Mexico City where they will
spend their honeymoon, taking
with them the best wishes of
their many friends here and in
Sonora.
J. R. Halstead, of the J. D.
Halstead Lumber Comoany, af
ter a week soent at Hermosillo
and Guaymas, on business for
his company, returned home last
Monday, greatly pleased with
his visit to the south country.
When at Guaymas he was a
guest at the Albin Hotel, which
under the personal management
of Messrs. Willoughby and So
leliac, of this city, is doing a
splendid business. The new own
ers of the Albin are past masters
in the art of entertaining and
anyone visiting Guaymas, should
remember The Albine.
Van V. Curtis, special agent
of the treasury department, made
an important arrest last Thurs
day afternoon, when he captured
Wong Jim and a complete "lay
out," consisting of pipes, scales,
two cans of opium pills, one can
of smoking opium, cans of yen
shee and bottles of yen shee
mixture. Jim is believed to be
the head of a well organized
gang of opium smugglers oper
ating in this vicinity. Mr. Cur
tis will have no trouble convict
ing Jim, whose trip back to the
Flowery Kingdom, will have to
be postponed until Uncle Sam
gets through with him.
VENATOR OUT ON BOND.
A. Venator, the Venator, Ore
gon, cattleman, who was arrest
ed last Sunday, by the Mexican
authorities, on a charge of at
tempting to smuggle 800 head of
SoDora cattle into the United
States, east of Nogales a few
miles, has been released on one
thousand dollars cash bond.
The cattle which Venator says
he was driving to Cananea, to
sell, are still being held, pend
ing a further investigation by
the Mexican authorities.
The accused man pleads ignor
ance of the law in Mexico which
for bids cattle to be driven into
the Federal Zone, extending
twenty miles south of the inter
national line, without a permit
from the Mexican government.
The matter is now in the hands
of the Chief of Customs, at Mex
ico City.
Mr. Venator is a wealthy, high
ly respected citizen of the state
of Oregon. His friends do not
believe he intended to defraud
the Mexican government, and
hope he'll be able to prove his
innocence.

One of the most important bills
passed in the Third Session of
the Arizona Legislature which
adjourned yesterday (March 8)
was the Public Welfare Bill in
troduced by Representative Mrs.
Geo. B. Marsh of Nogales.
The bill abolishes the Board
of Control and creates a commit
tee of three, consisting of the
Governor, Public Examiner and
a citizen to be appointed by the
Governor, to act as secretary of
the committee.
In addition to the work of ex
amining the affairs of all state
institutions, the committee will
also have charge of the purchase
of goods and supplies for the
same. A great saving to the
state will result through the fact
of the Public Examiner being a
member of the committee, the
Examiner being familiar with all
affairs appertaining to state in
stitutions and the purchase of
supplies for the same. The bill
provides for a practical busi
ness administration of the state
affairs and met with the hearty
approval of all legislators. No

Catarrh Cannot Be Cured
with LOCAL APPLICATIONS, as they
cannot reach the seat of the disease.
Catarrh is a local disease, greatly in
fluenced by constitutional conditions,
and in order, to cure it you must
take an internal remedy. Hail's Ca
tarrh Cure is taken internally and
acts thru the blood on the mucous sur
faces of the system. Hall's Catarrh
Cure was prescribed by one of the best
physicians in this country for years. It
is composed of some of the best tonics
known, combined with some of the
best blood purifiers. The perfect com
bination of the ingredients in Hall's
Catarrh Cure is what produces such
wonderful results in catarrhal condi
tions. Send for testimonials, free.

FOR BETTER ROADS.
Arizona to Receive $137,027 From
Our Uncle Sam.
Arizona will receive $137,027
under the Federal government
road appropriation for the fiscal
year from July 1, 1917, to July
1, 1918. Thirty-two states in
the Union receive more from the
government than Arizona and
fifteen receive less out of this
fund of $10,000,000 for good
roads than Arizona did.
Since the appropriation for the
fiscal year ending July 1, 1919,
is to be a third larger than the
one ending in 1916, Arizona may
count on receiving a third more
for 1918 19 than for 1917 18. The
scale will be a steadily rising
one, for the fiscal year ending
July 1,1920, the sum of $20,000,
000 will be expended and the
year following, $25,000,000.
This appropriation has noth
ing to do with the million dollars
a year for a period of ten years
which the federal government is
expending in building trails and
developing roads within or part
ly within the government for
ests. Out of this sum Arizona
gets the sum of $59,000 this year
in addition to the other amount
mentioned. Exchange.
AJO COMING TO THE FRONT
The Ajo district, located in
Pima county, 42 miles southwest
of Gila Bend, is rapidly coming
to the front, as one of Arizona's
great mining centers. The im
mensity of the ore bodies de
veloped in this district, is phe
nomenal. The new Cornelia has
blocked out a tonnage of 42,000,
000; the Ajo Consolidated has
developed over 20,000 tons of
high grade ore, and the Ajo
Cornelia, adjoining the Ajo Con
solidated, is, in the opinion of
experts, destined to become the
next great mine of the district.
With these properties and others,
Ajo will, in a very few years, be
one of the greatest centers of
the copper industry in Arizona,
if not in the west.
The Ajo Cornelia property is
one of the newest and one of the
most promising companies of
the district. Great outcrops of
high grade ore abound, and it is
near one of these dikes, that
the company is at present sink
ing a shaft. A diamond drill
will be put to work in the near
future. President Ed ward Grant,
who is in charge of the work,
expects to sink the big double
compartment shaft to a depth
of 500 feet in the next three
months, and then to start cross
cutting. Bunk-hocses, toolsheds,
and other surface buildings have
been erected, and an abundant
supply of tools is on the ground.
The town of Ajo, a mile dist
ant from the Ajo Cornelia, is a
growing mining camp of 4000
people. With the completion of
the new railway by the New
Cornelia people, and the en
trance of the three big mines in
to the shipping class, Ajo is ex
pected to jump to 10,000 popula

It Always Helps
says Mrs. Sylvania Woods, of Clifton Mills, Ky.f in
writing of her experience with Cardui, the woman's
tonic. She says further: "Before I began to use
Cardui, my back and head would hurt so bad, I
thought the pain would kill me. I was hardly able
to do any of my housework. After taking three bottles
of Cardui, I beg?.n to feel like a new woman. I soon
gained 35 pounds, and now, I do all my housework,
as well as run a big water mill.
I wish every suffering woman would give
The Woman's Tonic
a trial. I still use Cardui when I feel a little bad,
and it always does me good."
Headache, backache, side ache, nervousness,
tired, worn-out feelings, etc., are sure signs of woman
ly trouble. Signs that you need Cardui, the woman's
tonic. You cannot make a mistake in trying Cardui
for your trouble. It has been helping weak, ailing
women for more than fifty years.
