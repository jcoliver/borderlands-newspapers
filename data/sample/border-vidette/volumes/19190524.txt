PATAGONIA.
Interesting News Items Clipped From
the Patagonian.
Good copper-silver ore is be
ing found at the California mine,
near the Flux property, as de
velopment work progresses. The
California is owned by E. E.
Bethell and W. S. Wilson.
Ed. Collie, Henry Ismond,
John McDonald and G. A. La
Bounty, who had the contract to
put down the first 50 feet of the
new shaft on the American Boy
mine, have completed their
work.
J. R. Pinlay, mining engineer
of New York, in company with
Ed. 'P. Bohlinger, local mining
man, made an inspection of the
Three R mine during the past
week, it being Mr. Pinlav's de
sire to more thoroughly acquaint
himself with the character of
this famous copper property.
Lieutenant R. E. Meyer of
Tucson has arrived in Mowry
and will have charge of the as
say office at the Mowry mine.
Mr. Meyer was recently dis
charged from the army. Dur
ing his service in Prance he was
connected with the French army,
since he was proficient in the
native language.
Ed. Sheehy is doing develop
ment work on the Wellington
group of claims, adjoining the
World's Fair mine on the south.
Considerable low grade ore has
been uncovered and it is expect
ed a better - quality of rock will
be found as work progresses.
The property is owoed by
Sheehy Brothers.
J. F. Johnson has recently
made several shipments of ore
by parcel post from Parker Can
yon, the nearest postoffice to his
property in the West Huachucas.
From Patagonia the ore is sent
by express to the El Paso smelt
er. Surely only high grade ore
could stand such an expensive
method of transportation.
Ed. McFarland, a well known
old timer in the Patagonia dis
trict, spent several days here
during the week from Tyrone,
N. M., where he is engaged in
mining. Mr. McFarland owns a
ranch home near Patagonia, and
while he has gone back to New
Mexico it is possible he may
later locate in this district.
' It was a happy bunch of school
kids that lined up last Friday in
front of the Patagonia Drug
Company's store at the close of
the school term. The teachers

youngsters enjoyed this pleas
ant ending of a strenuous school
session would be stating it midly
Frank Wilson, now with the
American army in France, has
recently written his grandfath
er, Ben Powell, that he is in
good health and enjoys foreign
service. Mr. Wilson states he
does not expect to return to the
United States until 1920, from
which statement it is presumed
he has enlisted as a volunteer to
remain in Europe.
A uew Stover 10 horse power
engine has been installed at the
opera nouse, ana tnis cnange
will insure better lights and
better service. A new Simplex
projector has also arrived and
will be used by Mr. Gardner in
giving his motion picture show
tomorrow night. The new pro
jector is equipped with the ex
tr,iite shutter, which produces
a picture without any ilickering
whatever ana relieves all eye
strain.
The Abe Lincoln mine, form
erly known as the Blue Nose,
has been taken over under bond
and lease by the Layman Syn
dicate of Jerome, which will
proceed at once toward develop
ing the property on an extensive
scale, the first work contem
plated being to sink the present
150-foot shaft to a depth of 250
feet. The Abe Lincoln mine is
at present owned by Colonel R.
R. Richardsqn and in the past
has produced a quarter of a mil
lion dollars'-worth of lead-silver
ore. It is located two miles
southwest of Harshaw and about
one half mile west of the rich
Pierce Gardner lease.
THE MINERAL INDUSTRY.
The mineral industry still in a J
stage of readjustment. Markets
are quiet and production is still
largely curtailed. The various
industries are gradually using
np accumulated stocks, while
the government has been dispos
ing of its supplies. Prices are
reaching lower and more stable
levels and it is expected that
conditions and production will
improve. Building activity is
being resumed. While prospects
for foreign trade are improving
and ocean rates are declining,
the shortage of ocean bottoms is
still acute.
Freedom from strikes and in
creased labor efficiency are ab
solutely necessary to keep many
of the west's mines in operation
even on a greatly curtailed out
put. Production in still in ad
vance of consumption is most of
the staple metals and prices are
below cost of production.
The mines are marking time
now waiting for their second
wind, in the shape of orders due
to increased building and indus
trial activity in this country and
gradual beginning of re con
struction work in Europe.

the United States and of the
world for a period of several
months, in order to keep the
mines in operation, by the end
of the present year, consumption
should have caught up with the
surplus stocks now on hand
throughout the world and a brisk
demand be created for the metal.

THE CHAMBER OF COMMERCE
Has More Than Doubled Member
ship Since February 15.
Secretarr Gil Rankin of the
Nogales Chamber of Commerce,
has sent the following letter to
the Secretary of the Chamber of
Commerce of the United States,
Washington, D. C. :
"It may be of interest to you
to know that, without any ad
vertising and without any par
ticular campaign, this organiza
tion has more than doubled its
membership since February 15,
following the adoption of a Bud
get Plan of financing the Cham
ber and changing methbd of col
lecting dues from monthly to
quarterly.
"Due to the immense amount
of war work which fell upon the
Chamber and upon its secretary,
the membership had not kept
pace with the growth of the
community in population and
prosperity. Upon completing
the urgent war work, former
secretary, J. B. Bristol, secured
an assistant, furnished him with
a list showing the Budget Com
mittee's assessment of every
business house and business man
in Nogales, and sent him out to
collect. Within six weeks the
membership had been increased
from 70 to 120, and since the
, present secretary's election
April 1 there has been an in
crease of 23 members.
"Population, about G. 000.
"Each quarter a new Budget
Committee of three directors re
views the finances of the prev
ious quarter, approximates ex
penditures for the forthcoming
quarter, and base its assess
ments against the business es
tablishments upon ithe amount
required for the quarter. . How
ever, every business establish
ment, including non-members, is
apportioned an assessment and
invited to take membership.
Failure to become members any
particular quarter means simply
that assessment will be an
nounced and another invitaCion
issued the following quarter.
"Under the Budget Plan, ex
penses are divided into classes
telegraph, office , rent, salaries,
printing, etc and the amount
allotted for any particular class
of expense cannot be exceeded
except by special permission
from the Budget Committees;
and money allotted for one class
of expense cannot be spent for
any other purpose without permission."

TO CONNECT UP.
The announcement yesterday
by Division Engineer I. T. Fra
zier that the county of Santa
Cruz has fifty five thousand dol
lars immediately available, which
will be matched with a like
amount in Federal aid to build
to the Cochise line just six miles
from Huachuca Siding came as
good news since it will open up
a direct route to Nogales the
fast growing military point
where one million dollars in im
provements will be made at
once. This only leaves Cochise
a short six miles or so to build
and will complete an excellent
link in the system of state and
county highways and will be a
wonderful asset not only to
Santa. Cruz and Cochise county,
but Pima county as well, and
with the completion of the Bor
derland route in that locality
there will be no necessity for a
long time to make any addition
al trunk lines and another fact
that should not be overlooked is
that this will give Uncle Sam
just what he is looking for, a
short line connection over good
roads from Fort Huachuca to
Nogales. Prospector.
