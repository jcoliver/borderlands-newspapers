This shows that less than half
the males were of fighting age.
Of those of fighting age about
one half were fit to fight. So
the fighting strength of the Un

about 13,000,000.

Commissioner Sells has announc

elapse before they will go into

designated reservations.
About 15 livestock inspectors
will be cut off the salary roll by
the Arizona Sanitary Board, in

result of a shortage of funds be
cause of the decrease in inspec

roll will be reduced about $1000
a month. The board stated that
it was to be distinctly under
stood that cutting down the
number of inspectors employed
was not because they are not
needed, nor because of inefti

J. B. Schriever of Scranton,

home early in the week after
spending a few days at this pro

Mr. Schriever is very much
encouraged with the outlook at
the mine and predicts big things
for the Morning Glory at no dis

with the progress of develop

AN INfcRNATIONAL FENCE.
WoulJ End "Reciprocal Rustling" of
Cattle on Border.
An international fence along
the Mexican border, horse high,
bull-strong and practically man
proof, is the suggestion made by
members of the Arizona Live
stock Sanitary Board for the
purpose of putting a stop to the
"reciprocal rustling" ot cattle
that is continually going on in
the border district.
The cattle rustling situation
on the Arizona Mexico border is
getting so serious a"s to require
the attention not only of the
state livestock board and their
inspectors, but the military au
thorities as well.
The Arizona Livestock Board
received a letter from Colonel
Carnahan, of the Twenty fifth
Infantry, in charge of the No
gales district on the border, call
ing attention to the amount of
cattle thievery going on in that
district from both sides, and
pointing out the possible conse
quences and suggesting a means
of stopping the practice.
While Colonel Carnahan is
careful to state that it is not a
military matter; that he is more
than willing to be of any possi
ble assistance in devising me
thods of combatting the prac
tice, and suggests that represen
tative cattlemen from both sides
of the line get together at some
border point, with the board and
the military authorities, and de
vise means of putting a stop to
cattle running.
"From the reports that we
have been receiving," said Chair
man E. H. Crabb, of the live
stock board, "it seems apparent
that there is a lot of what might
be called 'reciprocal rustling'
going on from both sides. A
gang of- Mexican rustlers come
over and run off a lot of Amer
ican cattle. Then a lot of Amer
icans, who are only looking for
an excuse, go over and run off a
lot of Mexican cattle to get
even. The practice must be
stopped in some way, and the
board will probably adopt the
suggestion of Colonel Carnahan
for a meeting on the border to
look into the matter.
"The board would like to see
a strong, substantial fence along
the border, but we have never
before said so because it seemed
unlikely of accomplishment.
Perhaps thA matter has by this
time gotten into such serious
shape that the suggestion for an
international fence will be taken
up seriously. It would not ab
solutely prevent rustling, but it
would help to track and capture
both varieties of bandits, be
cause they would have to cut
the fence to make a raid, and
would be easily tracked from
t'-ie point where they crossed
the line."
WILL RACE FOR $10,000 PURSE
That' Phoenix boosters of the
El Paso Phoenix road race mean
business is attested by a tele
gram received this week by M.
Li. Naquin from W. E. Ferguson,
authorized by the Phoenix Fair
Association to promote the race,
says a recent dispatch from El
Paso.
Mr. Ferguson states that he is
ready to take up the matter of
turning in $2500 for Phoenix,
the city of El Paso to make a
like, donation towards the purse.
The cities of Tucson, Douglas
and Bisbee will each contribute
$1000, says the wire, making a
total of $8000 as a starter. Mr.
Ferguson continues that at least
20 entries at $100 each are ex
pected, which will raise the
purse to $10,000. He suggests
a division of this purse 70 per
cent for first place, 20 per cent
for second place and 10 for third.
In order to better plan the
reorganization of the national
guard of Arizona, Adjutant Gen
eral Ingalls has asked the attor

whether money propriated by
the 1917 legislature is still avail
able for the construction of state
armories. The attorney general
has indicated that a favorable
opinion will be forthcoming.

Is only one way to cure catarrhal deafness,

Imperfect hearing-, and when It Is entirely

Inflammation can be reduced and this tube

WADE-67 GETS 600 BARREL WELL
Nogales, Ariz., Sept. 9, 1919.
To the Shareholders in Wade Oil
Company, Block 57:
I am just in receipt of a letter
from W. D. Woodruff of Wichita
Falls, Texas, regarding the well
of the Wade Oil Company in
Block 57. Mr. Woodruff writes
as follows:
"Dear Mr. Bowman:
"Just returned home and found,
your letter asking for informa
tion as to th well of the Wade
Company in Block 57.
"Have just made a trip to the
Oeid anil find that our well will
make about 600 barrels a day,
probably no more. We are now
getting to run about 500 a day.
All the wells around us now are
on the pump or swab, so we
can't expect too much from our
well. Had we drilled 5 feet
deeper we might possibly have
gotten a better well, but were
afraid to do this on account of
salt water. Thought a 500 bar
rel well would beat none at all.
When we are in a position to
issue dividends the money will
be handled by the Guaranty
State Bank of Waxahachie. Wj
have run 20 tanks and have 3
full on the lease so hope to have
some money for our stockhold
ers by the first of October.
Haven't been able to get one
cent from the pipe lines yet and
don't know just when we will,
but hope it will only be a few
days. Ycurs very truly,
W. D. Woodruff.
I am having the above pub
lished in the hope that it may be
of some interest to the stock
holders in the company.

MADE AMERICAN CITIZENS.
Thursday in Superior Court,
Judge W. A. O'Connor officiat
ing, a number of well known
young men were made citizens
of the best country on earth
the good old United States of
America.
The first to receive a capital
prize, was Marcos Proto, a young
man who has grown up in No
gales. Arizona, where he has re
sided since coming here when a
mere boy, from Greece. Marcos,
who is a nephew of Uom Anton
Proto, saw honorable service in
the United States army. His
many friends will be pleased to
learn that Marcos is now a full
fledged gringo. He'll make a
good one.
R. A. Lehrke, manager of La
Ville de Paris of this city, also
drew a lucky number and is now
an American citizen. Mr. Lehrke
came to Nogales with the famous
12th Infantry, with which he
served three years, during a
greater part of which he was a
"top sergeant," wearing the
badge of an expert with rifle and
pistol. Since December, 1914,
when Sergeant Lehrke received
an honorable discharge from the
army, he has resided in Nogales,
where he has a wide circle of
American friends and acquaint
ances, all of whom will be glad
to learn that he is "one of us."
William J. Broad, of this city,
and Louis Romany of Cabalasas,
two well known Santa Cruz
county boys who saw service
with Uncle Sam's great army
overseas, took the oath of alle
giance, and are now American
citizens.
The petitions of Alex. Car
pena, Peter Versus, Carl Paul
Carlson, and Richard Block, will
be heard next March.
ARIZONA IS PROSPEROUS.
That Arizona is prosperous is
amply demonstrated by the re
port of the insurance depart
ment of the corporation commis
sion. Insurance premiums are
generally considered an excel
lent barometer of the general
prosperity of the country. The
premiums paid this year exceed
those of the year before by sev
eral hundred thousand dollars.
Premiums paid on life insur
ance in Arizona in the year 1918
in cities and towns of more than
3000 inhabitants amounted to
the sum of 4,132,525.81. This
exceeds the premiums paid in
1917 by 452,606.66.
Fire insurance premiums paid
amounted to 904,462.07, an in
crease over the previous year of
143,371.09.
A point of interest is that
towns of more than 3000 inhabit
ants receive half of the state tax
levied on insurance premiums.
A grand ball in honor of the
business men of Nogales, So
nora, will be given at the Santa
Cruz Club, by the Nogales Cham
ber of Commerce, on Thursday
evening, October 9th. Dr. A.L.
Gnstetter, chairman of the en
tertainment committee, and his
assistants, are working hard to
made the dance a big success. he 5ordrt Wx&ttk.
