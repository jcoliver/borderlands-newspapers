Johnny McDonald and young
Ramsdell, son of W. R. Rams
dell, were in town Wednesday
from the Pinal mine, where ex
tensive work is going on under
Mr. Ramsdell's supervision.
Good ore is being brought to
this station for shipment to the
smelter.
Sherman Rinehart, the Du
quesne cattleman, was in town
Saturday. He reports cattle in
his section doing as well as
could be expected, considering
the lateness of the spring. Gen
eral feeding is being resorted to
by cattlemen, and some losses,
mostly old stuff, are being sus
tained. Jerry Sheehy is doing work
on his claims in Red Rock. Re
cently a good strike of high
grade copper ore, with lead and
silver values, was made. No
arrangements will be made to
dispose of the ore until an ex
amination is made of its tellu
rium, which element is a large
part of the mineral.
The big oil flotation concen
trator at the Three R is report
ed to be working nicely the
machinery becoming adjusted
after the first few days of run.
The saving in values is also said
to be quite satisfactory. The
mill was down a few days this
week, owing to a shutdown at
the power house in Nogales for
repairs.
Many Duquesne freight teams
are again coming toward Pata
gonia withi zinc and copper ore.
Some of this ore had been ship
ped from the little station on the
Mexican side, below the Du
quesne property, but now it is
understood most of it will come
this way, arrangements having
been made with the smelter at
Clifton to treat the copper ore,
while the zinc is shipped to Col
orado.

Bill McComas and Sam Smith Secure
Valuable Mines.
Messrs. W. P. McComas and
! Sam H. Smith president and
' vice president respectively, of
the Cerro the Oro Mining and
I Milling company, whose articles
of incorporation were published
recently in this paper, have just
returned from Sonora, Mexico.
They have taken possession of
the famous Cerro Colorado
Mines, one of the largest free
gold properties on the Pacific
Coast. Negotiations for the
purchase of this well known
property have been under way
for some time and the gentle
men are quite elated at their
success in finally consummating
the deal.
This property, according to
some of the prominent, mining
engineers who have axamined it,
is literally a mountain of gold
bearing rock, as Mr. George B.
Earnshaw, the engineer who be
gan the operations on the Home
stake mines in 1878, says in his
reports "the tonnage is vir
tually incomputable, but there
are approximately four million
tons of pay ore in sight." The
property is equipped with a mill
of 500 tons daily capacity, and
the new owners expect to begin
operations in the very near fut-ure-
These gentlemen report politi
cal conditions in Mexico as
greatly improved, with the re
cently inaugurated administra
tion doing everything in its
power to improve conditions and
tc encourage foreigners to re
sume the explotation of their
properties. Tempe News.
Harry Barnett is still out at
the Happy Jack, pushing work
on that property. It is reported
in town that the tunnel at the
Happy Jack is expected to cut
the Clipper vein within another
