VISIT OF LIVE STOCK SQUAD
111' lunin ii i 1 ' 1 i. y 1 1 1 in;
activities 01 tne university live
stock squad while in this vicin
ity has been published, says the
Patagonian.
"At Patagonia Oscar F. Ash
burn showed the party over one
of the finest ranch headquarters
seen along the route. In the
evening a meeting of stockmen
was held at. the school house.
"From Patagonia the party
visited the famous San Rafael
ranch in the San Rafael valley
near the Mexican border east of
Nogales. Manager C. C. Chase
showed the students and special
ists how he keeps registration
records on the largest registered
Hereford breeding station in the
world. Few-peoble in Arizona
know that there exists in our
state a ranch of such magnitude
and distinction. Here 20,000
acres ot beautiful pasture is
divided into 27 separate pastures
by means of five and six strand
barbed wire fences. Within each
pasture 40 to 50 cows are run
with a separate bull.
"The method of keeping of
the registration records on cal
ves from 800 to 1000 registered
cows was carefully described by
Manager Chase. Riders visit
the pastures daily and the calves
are marked and recorded when
born. The bulls raised on this
ranch are used for breeding pur
poses on the extensive ranches
of the company across the line
in Sonora, Mexico, where 30,000
head of cattle are run on the
open range.
SUIT FILED FOR S200.000.
Suit for $200,000 was begun
Tuesday in Tucson by R. R.
Richardson against H. C. Harri
son in connection with the oper
ation of the Tree R mine in the
Pataijpnia district, says the Tuc
son Daily Star.
According to the complaint,
the defendants, with the consent
of the plaintiff, but upon the ex
pressed condition that they re
main personally responsible for
the fulfillment of their contract
with the plaintiff, transferred a
lease and bond they .held on the
Three R mine and property to
the Three R Mining and Milling
Company. It was alleged the
company failed to keep to the
terms of the contract between
the plaintiff and defendants, did
not pay royalties and allowed
taxes to accumulate, together
with liens and litigation and
other financial embarrassments.
It was alleged there is now due
and unpaid $200,000, for which
the plaintiff asks judgment.
Wright and Darnpll are attor
neys for the plaintiff.
Women's Faith in the League.
Miss Anne Lawther, Demo
cratic National Committeewoman
for Iowa, takes exception to the
assertion of Mrs. Medill Mc
Cormick, chairman of the Wo
man's Republican National Com
mitteee, that advocates of "the
League of Nations will be oblig
ed to vindicate it in every detail
to win the support of American
women."
"My experience has been
much different from Mrs. Mc
Cormick's," said Mrs. Lawther.
"At the suffrage convention in
March delegates from forty
eight States frankly favored a
League of Nations.
"At the meeting of the Feder
ated Clubs of Iowa, at Ames, in
June, 1,000 women adopted a
resolution endorsing the League
of Nations.
"The suffragists of the nation
and the federated club women of
Iowa are willing to 'walk by
faith' in this matter and blaze
a trail for the future men and
women of the world."
A. L. Kingsley on Monday of
this week purchased the Wilson
ranch in San Rafael Valley.
The property transferred con
sists of 80 acres of line valley
land, all under cultivation. The
consideration was $3,000. Mr.
Kingsley recently disposed of
his extensive interests in Cali
fornia, and, being a practical
farmer, knew no place he could
invest his money to better ad
vantage than in the fertile San
Rafael Valley. Patagonian.
FEW NATIONAL BANK FAILURES.
No national bank failures for
mere than six months and only
two small national lifinlr failnrps
' over the last nineteen months'
j period, is the record for immun
I ity in the past half century, ac
cording to the report on banking
conditions just made public by
the Comproller of the Currency.
Not since 1870 has this record
for immunity from failure for
national banks been equalled,
the comptroller declares.
Twenty charters for new na
tional banks were issued during
the month of July and fifty four
national banks were granted
permission to increase their cap
ital. The aggregate increase in
national bank capital was over
$12,000,000, while the capital of
the newly chartered banks
amounted to $780,000. Banking
conditions over the country in
dicate a flourishing market and
a general possession of money.
BENSON SMELTER TO OPEN.
Work on the Arizona Smelting
and Power Company's plant at
Benson is progressing rapidly
and it is now expected that the
smelter will be in operation
about the first of September.
A force of men and teams are
at work now grading for the in
stallation of the new railroad
spur from the Southern Pacilic
lines. The work of concreting
the smoke chambers and lead to
the stack has been completed.
The big compressor has been in
stalled and is ready to be start
ed. The boilers are"fn place
aod ready for the fires to be
lighted. The oil tank is in
shape and a spur will be con
tinued on to it so that the oil
can be unloaded direct into the
tank. A large cement water
storage tank has been completed
arid filled with water. The
present furnace is capable of
smelting 200 tons of ore a day.
Some ore has already been re
ceived and is on the platform
and other ore has been contract
ed for and shipments will com
mence within the next two
weeks. Patagonian.
NEW AUTO LICENSE LAW.
The following law regarding
auto licenses is now in force:
"Before issuing a license and
delivering number plates to any
person, company or corporation,
the secretary of state shall re
quire that such person, company
or corporation file a statement
from the county assessor stating
that the personal property tax
for the current year has been
paid on the motor vehicle to be
licensed, or a statement showing
that the personal property tax
is secured by real estate within
the county from which applica
tion is made."
The Yuma Lagipn post would
like to locate Charlie E. Dale
and Edward E. Daly, two boys
who answered the draft call
from this joint. The men were
honorably discharged from the
service and returned to Yuma,
but have since moved away and
their addresses have been lost
by the local authorities. Both
men are forfeiting very valuable
rights granted them by the U.
S. government because of the
fact that their addresses are un
known. Anyone knowing the
address of either of the two
boys will be doing them a great
favor by giving the same to
either Walter Sand berg of the
Toggery, or Harry Westover.
Yuma Sun.
Permits to sell miuing stock

the Arizona corporation com
mission in such numbers as to
indicate that cousiderable de

Catarrhal Deafness Cannot Be Cured

la only one way to cure catarrhal deafness,
and that is by a constitutional remedy.
Catarrhal Deafness is caused by an in

TOVREA BROTHERS LEAD.
Pioneer Arizona Butchers Reduce High
Cost of Living.
While Senate investigators are
investigating and federal food
sleuths are sleuthin, Bisbee is
about to deliver a real solar
plexus blow to that swaggering
and so far unbeaten bully, Hi
Cost O'Livin. The "punch" will
be delivered via the beef route,
prices for which are to be put
back on the approximate basis
prevailing seven years ago.
With beef on the toboggan prices
of other foods are bound to
drop, owing to the increased
amountof meat that will be sold.
Already the cheapest place in
the Southwest to live in, Bisbee
is showing the way to other
cities in the matter of cutting
down the price of necessities,
says the Bisbee Review.
The announcement of the
forthcoming reduction in beef
rates was made yesterday by P.
E. Tovrea, of E. A. Tovrea &
Co., the local packing and meat
firm. This concern sells at least
90 per cent of the meat consum
ed in the Warren district, and
also has markets at Douglas,
Nogales and Deming.
Mr. Tovrea, who announced
the coming reduction of prices
today, said that the abundant
rains and resultant grass on
which the cattle have been fat
tening made the reduction feas
ible. Here is the present scale
of prices and the new scale
which will go into effect Friday:
Present New
Price Price
T bone steaks 40 .30
Sirloin steaks 35 .25
Round steaks 35 .22k
Rib steaks . .- 35 .22 k
Short cuts steaks 35 .22k
Shoulder steaks 25 .17 k
Plank steaks 30 .22k
Rib roast 35 .22 k
Rump roast, 1st cut... 30 .22k
Rump roast, 2nd cut. ..25 .20
Shoulder roast . . 25 .17k
Short ribs 20 .15
Stews 20 .15
Brisket 20 .15
Shank bone 10 .07
This scale of prices will be in
effect not only in the Tovrea
shops, but in all the shops to
which they supply beef. The
Tovrea company has seven
shops in the Warren district,
three in Douglas, one in Noga
les and one in Deming. In ad
dition, they supply meat for all
the United States troops in the
state.

local agents for W. C. Laughlin
Company, operating mines at
San Xavier, Sonora, received a
telegram from LaColorada, stat
ing that on Tuesday one of the
company's trucks loaded with
camp and mine supplies, had
been ambushed by Yaquis, who
killed four soldiers, and Alfonso
P. Hennessey, a young man well
and favorably known in Noga
les, where he resided many
years. He was born in Tucson.
Jose Arvizu, the driver of the
truck, whose home is in Tucson,
and one of the Mexican guards,
escaped, according to the infor
mation from La Colorada, and
gavethe alarm.
News of the killing of young
Hennessey, will be learned with
regret by his many friends in
Arizona. He was on his way to
accept a good position with the
Laughlin Company, as a truck
driver. Before going south he
was connected with the United
States Immigration Service, and
was also a member of the No
