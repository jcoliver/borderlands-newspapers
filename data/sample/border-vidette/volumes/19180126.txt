More Public 8uildings Until After
the War.
Hon. Carl Hayden, has written
the Chamber of Commerce en
closing the following letter from
Secretary of the Treasury Ym.
G. McAdoo:
Washington, D. C, January
9th, 1918.
My dear Mr. Hayden:
Because of the pressing de
mands which are being made
upon the financial, industrial, la
bor and transportation resources
of the nation for war purposes,
I have directed that the con
strutftion of public buildings be
postponed except in cases where'
the necessity is so urgent that
the public interest would suffer
because of such postponement.
Among the buildings author
ized are the postoffice and court
honse at Globe, Arizona and the
Customhouse at Nogales, both
of which are in your district and
which I know you and the peb
pie of those towns desire con
structed at the earliest possible
date but here is the situation.
We are engaged in a great
war in which America's very
safety is seriously imperilled.
We cannot win this war unless
every resource of the nation is
carefully husbanded and used
with the utmost intelligence.
The great financial operations
of the Government, greater than
those ever undertaken by any
Government in the history of
civilization, make it necessary
that every unnecessary expend
iture by the Government, by the
states and municipalities and by
private corporations and indivi
duals shall be avoided while the
war is in progress. Unless this
is done, it will be impossible for
the poople of the United States
to furnish the money which the
Government must have to sup
port our soldiers and sailors
who are shedding: their blood
for us upon the battlefields. I
am advising cities and towns
throughout the country not to
erect public buildings while the
war is in progress. I cannot,
while giving them this advice,
consent to the erection of public
buildings by the Government of
the United States which is un
der the control of the Treasury
Department.
I am sure that there is not a
patriotic citizen who is not will
ing to submit to inconveniences
to help- win this war, and I am
sure that the people of Globe
and Nogales, when they know
the facts, will be more than will
ing to have the construction of
their public buildings deferred
for a short time so that the
money, which would otherwise
be put into them, may be used
to buy clothing and food and
ammunition for the gallant sons
of Arizona and other states who
are going out to tight and pei
haps to die for their country.
I am asking if you will be
good enough to let the people of
Nogales and Globe understand
the situation and to assure them
that had the war not come to
America, there would have been
no unnecessary delay in the con
struction of their federal build
ingSw These buildings will be
progressed as rapidly as possi
ble after the return of peace.
Sincerely yours,
(Signed) W. G. McAdoo,
Secretary.

ARIZONA NOTES.
Items of Interest Culled From Our
Exchanges.
The recent storm is of great
benefit to the country. The
farmers and cattlemen are re
joicing over the advent of the
rain and snow, as the fall has
been exceptionally dry, and cat
tie have had insufficient water
and the ground has been too dry
for the dry farm owners to plow.
Now plowing can begin and will
continue until spring. The-out-
look is good for good crops.
The Santa Cruz Patagonian.
Messrs. J. P. Hohusen and R.
I. Acull went to Phoenix last
week to report on farming land
in this county that loans have
been asked on. Their report
was but a partial one, and they
will soon return for further ap
praisements and the final report
will be made later. This is the
time of year when the money
asked for will do the most good,
as the farmers will soon have to
buy their seed and begin plant
ing; the plowing will be begun
immediately so the ground can
be put in proper shape for the
spring seeding. Patagonian.
A telegram was received by
the water users' association yes
terday from Congressman Carl
Hayden, stating that his amend
ment to the bill, which provides
for the putting on the market of
40,000 acres of Mesa land, pass
ed the house. The original bill
which passed the House some
time ago, provided for the sale
of the land but did not state
what disposition should be made
of the money. The amendment,
however, provides that the mon
ey from the sale of the land
shall be expended for getting
water on the valuable mesa
lands. Yuma Sun.

TO GET ROYAL WELCOME.
Secretary Kelly of the Yuma
chamber of commerce, has re
ceived a communication from
the the Nogales chamber that
arrangements are being carried
out to make the annual conven
tion of the Arizona Cattle Grow
ers' association the most suc
cessful in the history of the or
ganization. Every thing will
be done to give the visiting cat
tlemen a royal welcome and look
after their comfort. The convention-
will be held on three
days, February 14, 15 and 16.
As the cattlemen of Arizona
are confronted with a great
many new conditions having im
portant bearing on the business,
it is important that as many as
possible should attend this meet
ing. Yuma will be represented
by several cattlemen from the
valley. Yuma Sun.
The cold wave that has struck
the Southwest is hard on poor
cattle in the drouth stricken sec
tions and a lot of damage is be
ing done. All stock that wea
ther through the first cold snap
will likely pull through.

supervision the deposits have
grown from fifty thousands to
approximately one half milliou

a good dividend for its stock
holders. He carries with him

BY THE GOVERNOR OF ARIZONA.
Whereas, it is provided- by
the Civil Code of Arizona,
Chapter XX, Section 18Uo, that
the Governor shall set aside by
proclamation annually a certain
day to be observed as Arbor
Day:
Whereas, it is fitting in
every respect that one day of
each year be dedicated by all
the people to the beautirication
of public grounds and thorough
fares, and to the improvement
of private estates, and that all
such work shall be attended by
abservances Appropriate to the
spirit of Arbor Day;
Now, Therefore, I, Geo.
W. P. Hunt, Governor of Ari
zona, -by virtue of the authority
vested in me by law, do hereby

the 8th day of February. A. D
1918, to be observed as Arbor
Day in the Counties of Cochise,
Gila, Graham, Greenlee, Mari
copa, Pima, Pinal, Santa Cruz
and Yuma; I do further proclaim
and set aside Friday, the 5th day
of April, A. D. 1918, to be
observed as Arbor Day in the
Counties of Apache, Coconino,
Mohave Navajo and Yavapai.
It is earnestly recommended
that on the days thus set apart
the traditions and purposes of
Arbor Day shall be fittingly cele
brated in all public, private and
parochial schools by the holding
of suitable exercises to inculcate
in the minds of the children the
benefits to be derived from the
preservation and perpetuation of
the forests, and for the plant
ing and protection of trees,
shrubs r and vines, whereby the
grounds surrounding such school
may be improved and beautified;
It is likewise urged that every
fraternal order, civic organisa
tion and individual citizen shall
enter into the spirit of Arbor
Day, as hereinbefore designated,
and in the ways recommended,
to the end that the earth on
which we live may be beautified
and made more fruitful, and that
posterity's heritage ma,y be en
hanced. In witness whereof, I have
hereunto set my hand and caus
ed the Great Seal of the State of
Arizona to be affixed.

IMPORTANT NOTICE.
Congress on Octobet 3, 1917,
amended the income tax law by
reducing the exemption on a
single person from $3000 to
$1000, and on a married person
from $4000 to $2000, in order to
increase the revenue for war
purposes.
If you are a single man and
your net income from all sources
for the year 1917 amounts $1000
or over, it is necessary for you
to file an income report, or if
your are a married man or the
head of a family, and had a net
income from all sources for the
year 1917 of $2000 or over, you
must file a report.

you will first figure your gross
income, which consists of money
derived from any and all sources.
From this you will deduct your
allowable expenses, which do.

household expenses. The re
mainder is your net income.

ject to a penalty of not less than
$20 or more than $1000; and for
making a false report you will
be guilty of a misdemeanor and
will be fined not exceeding $2000
or imprisonement not exceeding
one year, or both.
Should you desire any other
information in regard to the in
come tax report the collector
will have competent deputies in
his office co answer your ques
tions and to assist you in mak
ing a report.
Respectfully,
Lewis T. Carpenter,
Collector.

ARIZONA SUNSHINE.
Take notice, you people of the
regions of cold and cloudy days
where the leaden skfes allow
the sun to break through only
occasionally, and where the
damp and dreary weather makes
life anything but enjoyable.
Listen to the report of Uncle
Sam's weather officials at Phoe
nix for the month of November.
Is this truly a land of sun
shine? Cease, if you can, your
shivering and shaking for a min
ute and reflect upon this:
Out of a possible 313 8 hours
of sunshine during those thirty
days just passed, tnere were
296.4 hours of bright warm sun
light dealt out to the happy,
contented, healthy and prosper
ous people of this part of the
state of Arizona.
Can you realize it, you people
of the North? It was possible
for Phoenix to have enjoyed
only 17.4 more hours of sunshine
during the past month than she
received.
Some record for a cold and
desolate people to reflect upon?
Yes, but not unusual for this
country. A matter of no news
to the people who live here and
enjoy, daiiy, this unparalleled,
inimitable, unexampled, origin
al, rare, unique, unmatched,
salubrious, healthy, splendid,
glorious, bright, vigorous and
life-giving climate.
The monthly report just is
sued by the local weather bureau
shows that November this year
was somewhat warmer and a
little drj'er than the average of
November, just a little too dry
to please the stockmen who have
been patiently waiting, for rain.
The highest temperature re
corded for November was 88 de
grees, which occurred on the
first four days of the month.
This is within four degrees of
the record.
The coldsst morning of the
month was on the 29th, when
the mercury went down to 34
degrees. This also was the only
date upon which general heavy
frost occurred throughout the
valley. It marked the end of
the growing season over most
of the cotton acreage.
There were 26 entirely clear
days during the month, 4 partly
cloudy days, and no rainfall at
all. Reports for the months pre
ceding show that there has been
no rain of any consequence in
this vicinity since September 13.
October is normally a dry month,
but the average rainfall for No
vember is almost one inch.
Arizona Republican.
Evidently Governor Hunt be
lieves that women of Arizona
should have equal voice in all
school matters. On Tuesday he
appointed Mrs. Betty White, of
Douglas, as member of the board
of regents of the University of
Arizona. Mrs. C. M. Roberts of
Cochise county was appointed
on the same board several days
ago. - .
First snow of the season fell
on Wednesday, January 9 in
northern Arizona. The fall was
general throughout that section
and Apache and Navajo counties
were blanketed to depth of from
four to six inches. The weather
is not severe and stock has not
suffered.

"From the time 1 en

Quality Luggage
of Refinement
ople
HAVE you ever considered how conspicuous your
luggage is when traveling and how much people
associate you with the impression it creates? If
you want the height of refinement, style and durability in traveling
goods you will find it in the Belber line, which, in our estimation, is
the finest line of luggage made.
Your clothes need no re-pressing when you take them from a
Belber Wardrobe Trunk. Your hats, gloves, shoes and jewelry have
special drawers or compartments which are instantly available
when the trunk is opened.
Belber bags and suit cases are made of the highest grade
leathers. The Belber Fitall adjustable holder makes them won
derfully convenient, enabling you to get at your toilet accessories
instantly without disturbing the other contents, and at the same
time giving you the usual packing space.
Come in and see these goods.
