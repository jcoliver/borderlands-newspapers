The Spirit of Friendship.
This store looks upon its patrons not
merely as customers but as friends.
People purchase here because they
have friendly feeling for this store.
The cause which develops this friendly
feeling, may differ, in fact, they are
sure to differ. One's friendship for
the store is the result of finding good
values; another's is the result of effi
cient service and courteous treatment,
and so on.
Naturally this friendshiply feeling on
the part of our patrons is reciprocated
on our part. And this spirit of mutual
friendship is an impetus for greater
service and an incentive to ever-increasing
endeavor to make this store
a place where every visitor will feel
perfectly at home.

Miners, Stockmen and Farmers Are
Prosperous and Contented.
Probably in no "other section
of the country is the spirit of the
west more manifest than right
here in Arizona, the treasure
state, says the Phoenix Messen
ger. Here it has been demon
st rated that the people are the
best of all the diversified pro
ducts of America.
Rich in mines, cultivated lands,
forests and vast ranges, this
section is richer still in the
quality of manhood and woman
hood, that unconquerable spiritof
the west that has wrested from
Nature, the hidden treasures of
mountain, plain and valley.
Thoughtful, courageous men,
braved the desert, distances and
hostile Indian tribes and planted
the foundation of a mighty em
pire. These were followed by
men of brawn, education and
scientific skill. Along came men
of wealth and vision who financ
ed the railways, the big mines,
which are the pride of the na
tion, unlocked the desert secrets
by digging canals, building re
servoirs and stocking the ranges
with sheep and cattle until the
flocks and herds roam over a
thousand hills and mountain
sides.
Beautiful cities and towns
have sprung up as if by magic,
in response to development of
the rich resources of the country.
There does not exist any spirit
of jealousy as there is room for
all and advance in one line of
endeavor helps all the others.
Stockmen, miners and farmers
have much in common and these
united efforts have bnilded a
great state with about one bil
lion dollars in taxable wealth.
Price of copper is now fair
and the market stable, with in
dications of going higher. Stock
commands' a good price as does
the product of the ranches of
the valleys of the state. Ari
zona is prosperous, her people
are busy and the cities are grow
ing more rapidly than ever be
fore. In eight years the value of
property in Arizona has increas
ed a thousand per cent. New
enterprises spring up daily and
vast irrigation projects are con
temnlated that will more than
double the arable area. ' The
state has passed the experi
mental stage. Good schools and
stately churches abound. Our
people everywhere are content
and the process of creating an
empire unsurpassed, has just
begun. No enterprising man
can lose by casting his lot with
such a progressive people, men
and women who know no such
word as fail. True, there are
temporary loses and disappoint
ments, but the spirit of the west
has really transformed a desert
waste into a land of milk and
honey.
GET THE HABIT.
Modern methods of banking
are typical of America's demo
cratic way of doing business.
Rich and poor alike keep their
money in the same bank and the
dollar check drawn by the girl
clerk in the department store
on her small account, is honored
just as quickly and as little
questioned as a check drawn by
John D. on his account.
A deposit in the bank is the
basis of credit for any man or
woman. It establishes a per
sonal relation between the de
positor and the bank, which may
be of value in many ways to the
depositor. If he will ask his
banker's advice before investing
his savings in numerous schemes
which are afloat today seeking
to get his money, he will in
many instances be saved severe
loses.
The banking habit is a good
one to cultivate. It raises you
in your own estimation and sense
and confidence in your ability to
do things. Ex.
The interior department has
opened to purchase and settle
ment 11,000 acres of land in
Arizona, known as the Yuma
Mesa auxiliary reclamation pro
ject. The area is said to be al
most entirely free from frosts.
There is going to be plenty of
pep, dash and thrills for the
rough riding events at the state
fair this year, according to an
outline of the program which
Jack Barber, superintendent of
cowboy sports has submitted to
the fair association, and which
has met with their hearty ap
proval. The details will be
worked out at an early date.
For variety and spice and in
point of number and size of
prizes the rodeo stunts promise
promise to be on par with the
famous frontier sports of Pres
cott. Two thousand dollars is
the princely purse to be hung
up In the calf tying contest and
another $2,000 will go to the
winners of a bull roping con
test. Relay races, broncho bust
ing and all other contests of the
range which go to make a high
class rodeo program will be
staged, and with handsome cash
prizes to be offered in all of
these, it is expected that the
most notable outlaws and the
cleverest riders from all of the
western states will be drawn
here and participate in the ex
hibition. The entire inner field of the
race course has been turned
over to Barber as the stage for
his stupendous outdoor produc
tion of life on the range. A
Paige wire fence will enclose
will enclose the field, thus pre
venting interference with the
races and allowing both pro
grams to be carried on simulta
neously if desired. Messenger.
THE COPPER INDUSTRY.
Authorities on mining say that
once the capper market is stab
lized, it can be expected to hold
firm for at least five years. That
means at least five years of pros
perity for Arizona, the greatest
copper producing state in the
union.
Copper mining is, of course,
the greatest industry in Arizona.
There was a big slump when
copper dropped after the gov
ernment iremoved the price.
Small properties were forced to
shut down. The big properties
kept up operations but those
working low grade ores operat
ed at a loss.
With the rapid rise of copper,
however, and the prospect that
it will go much higher in price,
mining is beginning - to show a
big revival. It cannot be ex
pected to reach the war-time
prosperity, however, until cop
per goes to 30 cents, for that
will be about the equivalent of
26 cents at the present high
prices for everything which goes
into the cost of making copper.
A large volume of sales in
copper metal occured during the
month just past. It is estimated
that about 200,000,000 pounds of
the red metal changed hands.
This big body of sales was ac
companied in a market featured
by rising prices.
A larger amount of copper was
sold for export tiade than at
any time since the signing of the
armistice. Wage advances were
general in all the copper mining
districts during July.
VICTORY BARS FOR SOLDIERS.
Victory bars for soldiers who
served the nation in the world
war are now ready for distribu
tion at the various recruiting
and zone supply offices of the
army.
For every campaign, such as
the Cuban, the Haitian and the
Boxer campaign, the Govern
ment has issued campaign me
dals. These medals are hung
from bars on the breast by rib
bons. The color pattern of the
ribbon identities the campaign,
and instead of wearing the me
dal the soldier may wear simply
the bar covered by the special
ribbon. The world-war ribbon
is said to be the most beautiful
yet designed and contains a rain
bow combination of colors.
Four hundred thousand bars
will be received by the War De
partment in the first order and
they will be immediately pre
pared for distribution upon the
presentation of certified copies
of honorable discharge by sol
diers claiming them.
Readjustment of the world's
economic and industrial condi
tions, which were so badly dis
located by the war, is impossible
so long as there are fears and
doubts as to international rela
tions in the immediate future.
The establishment of a dozen
governments in Europe, the
boundaries between new nations,
the resumption of commerce with
the late belligerents, the exten
sion of credits and a hundred
other no less vital problems de
pend upon the conclusion of
peace.
There can be no real, stable
prosperity without peace. There
can be no peace until the treaty
between Germany and all the
countries with which she was at
war is an accomplished fact.
The present status of uncertain
ty is sure to produce unrest
among peoples everywhere and
consequent disturbance of busi
ness. The biggest and most power
ful nation in the world the Un
ited States is seriously affected
by its present position in the
twilight between war and peace.
As the most important factor in
the finance and trade of the
world the United States must be
free to return to its tasks at
home and abroad before Europe
and South America can find
themselves.
The New York World correct
ly diagnoses the present econo
mic situation when it says edit
orially: "There can be no approach to
normal conditions in this coun
try until the treaty of peace is
out of the way and the work of
liquidating the war has become
the chief concern of Government
as well as of the victims of the
existing situation. Business of
al) kinds is largely speculative
because of indefioiteness and un
certainty, and gambling has to
be paid for by somebody. In
this case it is paid for by the
consumer, who must take care
of both gains and losses."
Let the Senate ratify the
treaty and approve the covenant
of the League of Nations. That
act alone will stabilize the world.
It will turn the people's thoughts
from war. It will restore the
psychology of peace.
Ratify the treaty!

BOWMAN BACK FROM TEXAS.
President of Local Oil Co. Predicts
Big Things for Stockholders.
Stockholders of the Arizona
Mexico Oil and Refining com
pany have been made happy by
the outimistic reports regarding
the company's holdings which
have been made by Edward Pat
tee of Mesa and Wirt G. Bow
man, who returned from the
Texas oil fields, last Saturday,
says Monday's Nogales Herald.
The 100 acres owned by the
company according to the report
of Bowman and Pattee to their
associates, can be sold for $350,
000 at the present time.
At the present moment, a re
liable company is endeavoring
to negotiate with the Arizona
Mexico Oil & Refining company
to sink ten wells on a 45 acre
tract owned by the company. It
will cost $600,000 to sink the
wells. The company making
the proposition to the Arizona
Mexico company offers to main
tain the wells after they begin
producing, to assume all the ex
penses of maintenance and to
give to the stockholders of the
company 50 percent of the gross
output.
Prom the foreoroing facts it
can be seen that the Arizona
Mexico Oil & Refining company
surely "have something" in the
oil fields of Texas.
"There is no use in me ende
avoring to try to give my friends
an idea of the oil fields and in
particular our holdings," said
W. G. Bowman. "You simply
have to look over the ground to
be able to realize the opportun
ity offered us all to become
wealthy. The Arizona Mexico
Oil & Refining company's hold
ings are in the center of a proven
land. All wells that are coming
in are leading toward our prop
erty and the closer the wells get
to our holdings the bigger is the
flow from them. Within 60 days
our holdings will be worth mil
lions of dollars. I am not boast
mfr or bragrging regarding our
holdings. The data and figures
of experts and the trend of the
oil gushers toward our holdings
is what I am basing my state
ment on."
Regarding Wade JNo. 57, in
which a number of persons in
this section hold stock, Mr. Bow
man said that as soon as the
standard rig is sunk, a flow of
1500 barrels daily is estimated
by experts now on the ground.
It is my opinion that within a
short time, dividends will be paid
on Wade 57. The secretary of
the company has not been able
to give out reports on the prop
erty as regularly as might have
been issued but stockholders can
be assured that they will derive
a profit upon their investment.
It must be remembered thst the
original Wade acreage was
proven dry and the well now
flowing is so small that stock
holders cannot expect three or
four to one on their investment."
