Phoenix, Ariz., May 7. Whe
ther an effort would be made to
prosecute any of the fifty or
more men who participated early
yesterday in the lynching of
Star Daley for killing James Ray
Gibson and attacking Mrs. Gib
son on the Apache trail Thurs
day night, remained undeterinin
ed today when Governor Thomas
E. Camobell declined to discuss
the lynching. Both the local
authorities of Pinal county, in
which the lynching took place
and of Maricopa, county, from
which Dalej, whose real name
is Van Ashmore, was being re
moved by deputy sheriffs when
captured by the mob, said last
night, that they would not move
in the matter unless sc directed
by Governor Campbell. County
Attorney Richardson of Pinal
county poiuted out that a cor
oner's jury nad found that "Da
ley was the victim of justifiable
homicide committed by persons
unknown to the jury," and that
the identity of none of the mem
bers of the mob was known to
the officers. The authorities
further expresesd doubt that a
conviction could be had even if
any of the members of the mob
were brought to trial.
Daley, whose right name was
Van Ashemore, was taken from
deputy sheriffs early Sunday
morning, as he was being trans
ferred from the jail in Phoenix
to the penitentiary at Florence,
taken to the scene of his crime
and there executed after the
vigilantes, fifty in number, had
recited the Lord's prayer.
The prisoner was removed
from the jail here at midnight,
when the officers got word that
a plan was on foot to storm the
jail. The lynching occurred four
hours later at the scene of the
attacks on the Gibsons, near
Mesa. Daley, who had retained
his composure during the pre
liminaries to the lynching and
who showed a member of the
party how to make a noose,
collapsed at the last minute,
when he was asked if he wished
to pray and the mob recited the
Lord's prayer in unison for him.
Before he was hanged, Daley
confessed to the killing of Gib
son and the attack on Mrs. Gib
son and enumerated several hold
ups and bank robberies in Okla
homa, Kansas, Missouri and Cal
ifornia in which he said he had
taken part and in which he be
lieved he had killed three men.
Tom Campbell is governor of
Arizona under decision of Judge
Stanford, For five months or
since December sixth the matter
has been constantly before the
court either on recount of the
ballots or in contest proceedings
and at the conclusion of the case,
the people of Arizona are of the
same opinion as they were at the
beginning. Those who voted
for Campbell believed he should
win. On the other hand those
who supported Gov. Hunt and
many fair-minded people who
did not, were of the opinion he
was legally elected.

For Your Tires
You don't have to "shop" among tire dealers to
the exact tire you want,
nor buy one make of tire for your rear wheels
another make for your front wheels;
but you can get exactly the tires which will give
you the lowest-cost-per-mile of service among the five
different types of United States Tires.
And then you can hold one company the United

which is much simpler than trying to fix the re

There are five to choose from,
one for every need of price and use,
