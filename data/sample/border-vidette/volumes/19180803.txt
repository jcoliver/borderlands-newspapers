Demoorcatic 3Pi?i mary
Sept. lO
Registration Closes August 30
There is at least one office in Arizona that has been storm
proof during the tempest tossed days which have fallen to our lot
since we assumed the garb of statehood.
The secretary of state handles the detail of a great corpora
tion, guarding, compiling and certifying the vast mass of "docu
mentary evidence" which accumulates from day to day and year
to year; having in charge the tremendous automobile license de
partment; vising all state papers; acting as chief executive in the
absence of the governor, and in general keeping the lid firmly in
place.
There never has been one successful attack made upon the
conduct of this office. Never one single item that has reflected in
any way upon the man who has held down the job or the manner
in which it has been held down.
While the pitiless light of publicity has illuminated many a
nook and cranny of the state house never a shaft has discovered
a grain of dust or a cobweb in the office of the secretary.
"How have you done it?" a friend asked. "Why is it that
your enemies can't find a thing to kick about in your administra
tion?" The answer was characteristic: "I have attended to my own
business which in this case happened to be the business of the
people of Arizona. I could not play politics and be on the job at
the same time."
That may be the reason why Sidney P. Osborn has made a
good secretary of state. Many think it is the reason he will make
a good governor.
Nearly 2,000,000 girls and boys
have volunteered for the United
States Garden Army in the De
partment of the Interior. Their
service flag bears the crossed
rake and hoe with the letters U.
S. S. G., in blue on a field of
white with a red border. The
enlistment entails a pledge on
the part of the child to use all
efforts to increase food produc
tion by cultivating one or more
crops under a- garden supervisor
or teacher chosen for this work
and to make such reports as
may be required.
THE LIMIT, SIOOO.
The wealthy people of the
country would buy up every
War Savings Stamp issued if
they were allowed to do so.
Tl at is because they realize
how splendid an in vestment War
Savings Stamps are.
The interest is attractive, and
the security is the best in the
world.
Hut the United States govern
ment has placed the limit of any
individual's holdings in War Sav
ings Stamps at $1,030, maturity
value.
The reason for this is that
War Savings Stamps are for
ALiLi the oeoplo.
The first object of War Sav
ings Stamps is to raise money
to purchase supplies for our
army and navy.
The second object is to create
thrift among all the millions of
Americans so they will stop
purchasing things which they
can just as. well get along with
out. This is because non essen
tials require men and materials
which can be used to far better
advantage in the manufacture of
war essentials, for backing up
our boys at the front and on the
seas.
The government wants every
man, woman and child to save
and buy War Savings Stamps to
the limit of their ability, whether
it is one Thrift Stamp or 200
War Savings Stamps.

MOEUR OF FRENCH DESCENT.
We are infored that Mr. W. A.
Moeur, who is seeking the nom
ination on the Democratic ticket
for the high office of governor
of the state, is of French de
scent, and not German, as has
been said by some persons. Mr.
Moeur was born in Tennessee,
later moving to Texas, where he
lived prior to his taking up Ari
zona as his future home. One
of Mr. Moeur's sons is a first
lieutenant in the U. S. Army,
now serving with the expedi
tionary forces in France;another
son is in training at Camp Cody,
and a younger son is anxious to
join the colors, but is too young
to go. This statement is made
in justice to Mr. Moeur, as he is
a thorough American and does
not deserve to be thought of in
connection with anything Ger
man, either by name or sym
pathy Patagonian.
The campus of the University
of Arizona, ordinarily almost de
deserted during the summer
months, is a busy place now,
and there is every indication
that soldier training will consti
tute a large part of the work of
the institution for the duration
of the war. Two hundred spe
cially inducted men, mostly from
from the states of Utah and Ne
vada, reached the campus about
July first and are being trained
as auto mechanics concrete
workers, rough carpenters, black
smiths, electricians, machinists,
and radio operators. The course
includes two hours military in
struction and six hours of tech
nical training each day with a
half holiday on Saturday, and
runs for eight weeks. Twelve
instructors have been provided
by the University authorities,
and the fullest possible use is
being made of the various shops
and laboratories of the institution.

In order to develop as a mili
tary asset a large body of young
men in the colleges and to pre.
vent unnecessary and wasteful
depletion of the colleges through
indiscriminate volunteering, the
War Department contemplates
the establishment at the Uni
versify of Arizona of a Stu
dent's Army Training Corps
during the coming school year.
This will be accomplished by
providing efficient military in
struction under the supervision
of the War Department. Offi
cers returning from overseas
and unfit for further field ser
vice will be utilized when avail
able. All able bodied students over
the legal enlistment age of 18,
will be encouraged to enlist in
the United States Army, while
students under 18 will be per
mitted to enroll for instruction
with the unit. The student who
enlists thereby becomes subject
to actual service at the call of
the President of the United
States, but it will be the policy
of the government not to call
them to active service until they
reach draft age unless com
pelled to do so for military
reasons.
Enlisted students will be on
furlough until called to the
colors, and will receive no pay
nor allowances except when at
tending summer training camps,
when they will be entitled to
transportation and rations. All
enlistments will be in the grade
of private.
Students may be discharged
from the service for good rea
sons, such as unfitness, misbe
havior, dependent relatives, and
the necessity of leaving college
for causes beyond the student's
control. Such discharges will
not release the student from
liability to draft.
Th time alloted to military
work will be ten hours a week
during the college year, supple
mented by six weeks of inten
sive training in a summer camp.
The government will supply ne
cessary uniforms, rifles, and all
other equipment so far as such
articles are obtainable.
