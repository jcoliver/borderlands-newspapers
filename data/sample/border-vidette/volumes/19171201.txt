Potatoes are selling here now
for $2.50 per hundred. Only a
few of the ranchers however,
are selling at this price, most of
them having stored their pota
toes for the winter, or until
prices go up. Flagstaff Leader.
An urgent appeal to the
women of the country for more
knitted sweater, socks and wrist

has been made by the national

machine"made sweaters have
been purchased by the Red
Cross to meet the immediate
demands.
Production figures of the Ray
Consolidated Copper company
for the third quarter of 1917
shows an output of 21,656,342
pounds of concentrates as com
pared with 22,255,598 pounds in
the preceding quarter. The daily
milling average was 9,797 tons
as compared with 9,804 tons
daily during the previous three
months.
Diamond drilling operations
have begun at the property of
the Magma Chief Copper com
pany at Superior, drills having
started Tuesday morning. The
first hole is being started at the
900 foot point in the Watson
tunnel and will be approximately
600 feet deep. Progress was
being made this week at the rate
of about fifteen feet a day. Cop

The campaign for the sale of
Red Cross Christmas seals will
soon be under way in Arizona
and the State Anti-Tuberculosis
society has fixed as its goal the
sale of 1,000,000 seals at one
cent each, or $10,000. Of course
the society is perfectly willing
that all of the 2,500,000 seals
which it has on hand can be
sold, but to fall below the 1,000,
000 mark will be regarded as a
state failure.
Dr. F. E. Sbine, for the last
fifteen years chief surgeon of
the Copper Queen medical
department and of the El Paso
& Southwestern Railroad med
ical department, left his post at
Bisbee Monday for Washington
in answer to a summons from
the war department. Dr. Shine
some time ago otierea nis ser
vices to the war department, but
the call that reached him last
Sunday gave no intimation as to
what his work is to be.
The suffragette pickets around
the Wnite House are now dis
playing banners that they are
being sent to jail for opposing a
political party. The statement is
not true. They are being sent to
jail on common vagrancy
charges for insulting the pre
sident of the United States. The
president is not a political party,
nor a member of a political
party. He is simply the ruler of
all the people" Winslow Mail.
Congressman Carl Hayden of
Arizona today was the guest of
Brigadier General Alexander M.
Tuthill, commander of the Seventy-ninth
brigade at Camp
Kearney. A special drill was
given in his honor. Later Con
gressman Hayden delivered a
stirring address to the one hun
dred and forty-eight (Arizona)
infantry. Congressman Hayden
and Brigadier General TuthilL,
formerly served as captains in
the same regiment.
George Young, secretary of
Greerie-Cananea, has gone to
Mexico City, where he will prob
able be engaged the remainder
of this month. Mr. Young's visit
to the Mexican capital at this
time is considered to indicate
that negotiations have again
reached an advance stage with
reference to the resuption of
operations by American mining
interests in Mexico under altered
and favorable government tei ms.
Mr. Young has been very pro
minently identified with Greene-
Cananea affairs in Mexico for a
number of years and holds the
esteem of all leaders among the
several Mexican factions. Few
Americans might be assigned to
negotiations at Mexico City with
more reason for expectations
that success would attend.
Whether Fred T. Colter,
national democratic committee
man from Arizona, secures the
democratic nomination for gov
ernor or not, there is one thing
to be learned from his method of
canvassing by political aspirants
for that position that has not
been very closely observed in
the past. Mr. Colter is making
a. clean, gentlemanly canvass
among the voters of the state,
strictly on his own merits and
not on the supposed or alleged
frailties of those other good men
who seek the same goal. During
the campaign two years ago,
two excellent men, Geo. A.
Olney and Geo. W. P. Hunt,
were candidates. Each had al
ways been exemplary citizens,
both in public and private life,
yet they were maligned, traduced
and lied about scandalously by
the small bore politicians. The
result was disastrous to the
party and it caused a breach
that injured Arizona materially.
Fred Colter will have none of
that character of campaign if it
can be prevented. His life is an
ooen book and the excellent men
opposed are likewise honorable.
It is time the people took cogniz
ance of these thiDgs and the first
man who throws mud should be
swatted.
Assassins of character are
more to be dreaded than those
who boldly take human life. It
is the insidious work of moral
cowards to assault the good
names of men simple because
they stand for officer.
Arizona in the past has suffer
ed much from this short signted
procedure Which is likened unto
a man who tries to lift himself
by the boot straps. Tearing
down the character of another
does not add one whit to the
fame of the other fellow.
When all indulge in vitupera
tion and mud slinging, the
nominee, when chosen is so
weakened before the people that
he is easy prey for the enemy on
election day.
It is much preferable to go
down to honerable defeat in a
fair contest, retaining one's self
respect than to win preference
at expense of the good name of
a friend. The Messenger
Gravity Not a Test for Gasoline.
"The popular opinion that
specific gravity (or degrees
Beaume) will suffice as a test for
gasoline is unfortunately errone
ous" says the U. S. Bureau of
Standards.
In commenting on this state
ment, recently, F. L. Bosch,
head of the local agency of the
Standard Oil Company said:
The reason gavity is mislead
ing as a test for gasoline is plain
enough when you understand
that boiling points alone deter
mine real motor fuel efficiency.
Gravity tells nothing at all
about boiling point's and their
proper range and continuity.
"To be 100 per cent efficient,
gasoline must have its boiling
poiDts in a continuous, unbroken,
gradually rising series.
"In this connection it is also
important to note that only
straight-distilled, refinery gaso
line can have its boiling points
in a continuous chain. No mix
ture on earth could be concocted
to contain all the hundreds of
necessary fractions. Yet the
gravity of this mixture might be
satisfactory, thus deceiving any
one depending on gravity for
motor fuel efficiency and eco
nomy." COLT KICKING UP.
The colt in Senator Colter is
certainly kicking up some dust
on the gubernatorial nomination
democratic race track: He has
never been driven in harness
because all efforts have failed to
put a bit in his mouth, but he just
naturally trots around that demo
cratic race tract like a duck
glides on the surface of the wat
ers. The people have their eyes
on him, and if any of our other
democratic race horses outrun
him they will have to travel with
speed. Prescott Courier.
If you have a blind baby, or
you know of one in this state,
you will be interested to learn
that Arizona gives special care,
maintenance and eduction to its
blind, from the day of blindness.
In 1912 Governor Hunt signed
a bill introduced by Represent
ative Whipple, giving the State
Board of Education power to
provide for the State blind
babies in any institution equip
ped ' for their care. The first
child to be appointed was a baby
from Phoenix. It was sent to
the Arthur Home for Blind
Babies, Summit, N. J. Tuition
and transportation of the child
was paid for by the state.
A report just received relative
to the progress of Little Ariz
ona, as she is affectionately call
ed in the school, states that she
is well and walking, can go
around her crib by holding on,
and it will not be long until she
can step out into the dark alone.
Arizona is normal in every
way but in eyesight. She is very
pretty but totally blind. She
can remain in this institution
which is a Home, Nursery, Hos
pital and Kindergarten combin
ed until able to graduate to some
state school for the higher edu
cation for the blind. All the
blind babies of the state are en
titled to this care.
Therefore it is the duty of
anyone knowing of a blind baby,
to acquaint the parents of the
fact that if they communicate
with the State Superintendent
of Public Instruction, the Hon.
C. O. Case, of Phoenix, Arizona,
provision will be made for its
special care and education. Ari
zona is one of thirteen states
that provide for their baby
blind.
DON'T PLANT TRESS EARLY.
Fall planting of fruit trees
should be delayed to late Nov
ember or early December,
advises the United States depart
ment of agriculture.
A pomologist of the depart
ment writes in answer to a New
Jersey inquirer he would hesitate
to advise planting in any section
as early as October because of
probable injury to the trees. In
sections of the north where cold
weather prohibits planting in
November or December, he says,
it is usually better to plant in
the spring. Apple trees can be
planted with safety in the fall
father north than peach trees
and other less hardy kinds.
At the Misssouri experiment
station it recently has been
shown that little or no root
action takes place with fall
planted trees until the surface of
the ground ha3 begun to freeze,
and the trees planted early in
the fall may lose considerable
vitality before they begin root
a fiction.

The Nogales chapter of the
American Red Cross completed
100 comfort kits yesterday for
the boys in training cam ps, from
Santa Cruz county, says Thurs
day's Herald. This is the sec
ond lot of kits which the chap
ter has completed, the other kits
having been sent to headquart
ers a short time ago for distri
bution in France. These kits
each contained fifteen articles
which will no doubt be very use
ful to the boys. The kits were
made up of a needle case, shoe
strings, Trench mirror, foot pow
der, writing tablet, envelopes,
tobacco, cigarette papers, thread,
pen points, pencil, handkerchief,
bachelor buttons, a wash rag
and soap. The articles were
neatly wrapped in a brown bag
and paper. They will be sent
away in a short time' so that
there will be no chance of them
not being delivered Christmas
morning. About sixteen mem
bers were present at the Red
Cross meeting on Monday and
the highest commendation is
due them for the work they accomplished.

LIVER DIDN'T ACT
DIGESTION WAS BAD
mm
Says 65 year Old Kentucky Lady, Who Tells How She Was Relieved
After a Few Doses of Black-Draught.
Meadorsville, Ky. Mrs. Cynthia
Hiffginbotham, of this town, Bays: "At
my age. which Is 65, the liver does
not act so well as when young. A few
years ago, my stomach was all out of
fix. I was constipated, my liver
didn't act. My digestion was had, and
It took so little to upset me. My ap
petite was cone. I was very weak...
I decided I -vrould give Black
Draught a thorough trial as I knew tt
was highly recommended for this
trouble. I began taking It. I felt
better after a few doses. My appetite
Improved and I became stronger. My
bowels acted naturally and the least
trouble was soon righted with a few
doses of Black-Draught."
Seventy years of successful use has
made Thedford's Black-Draught a
standard, household remedy. Every
member, of every family, a't times,
need tho help that Black-Draught can
give In cleansing the system and re
lieving the troubles that come from
constipation, indigestion, lazy liver,
etc. You cannot keep well unless your
stomach, liver and bowels are In good
working order. Keep them that way.
Try Black-Draught. It acts promptly,
gently and in a natural way. If you
feel sluggish, take a dose tonight
You will feel fresh tomorrow. Price

should be changed. The method
of presenting to the meeting a

directorships is used by other
similar organizations elsewhere.

met last evening and prepared
the following list of members,
thirty in number, to be present
ed at the Annual meeting. The
meeting is free to repudiate en
tirely the work of the Committee

that members may come to the
meeting prepared to select a
hard working body of men, will
ing and capable of giving some
time to the welfare and advance

them, a working Board and one
that represents all lines of
thought and activity in the ciiy.

Combination Food Sales Forbidden.
Pood Administrator T. A.
Riordan has received the follow
ing telegram from the National
Pood Administration:
"On and after this date, all
combination sales of food com
modities are forbidden, with tha
exception stated below. The sale
of one or more food commodities
upon condition that the pur
chaser shall buy one or more
other food commodities from the
seller is regarded as a combina
tion sale within the meaning of
this ruling. Combination sales
frequently result in the sale of
more foodstuffs than the par
ticular purchaser would ordin
arily buy and are therefore
determined to be a wasteful
practice within the meaning of
Section 4 of the food administra
tion act of August 10, 1917. The
exception is, pending further
notice, as, a wheat conservation
measure, the dealer may sell
sugar in combination with corn
meal, at the rate of one pound
of sugar with two of cornmeal.
No other combination will be
permitted, nor will any other
ratio than that here stated be
allowed. The dealer shall not
sell either sugar or cornmeal at
a price yielding him a greater
profit than he has normally
enjoyed upon the particular
commodity. The dealer is not
required to make combination
sales of sugar and cornmeal, but
may do so at his descretion.
Active steps should be taken at
once to enforce this decision.
