Arizona has 15,700 motor cars
according to the records kept by
Sidney P. Osborn, secretary of
state. At this time last year the
number was 9432. Here in
Phoenix the increase in autos is
about one hundred cars each
month. Messenger.
New potatoes are now selling
four pounds for a quarter and
eggs are but thirty cents a dozen.
Those who have been eating a
pound of beefsteak can now
have a dozen eggs instead. The
price of wheat and flour has,
dropped materially and the
back-yard gardens are already
beginning to reduce the high
cost of living. Messenger.
Important revisions in the
plan for training the war army
have been made by the war de
partment, which auncuoces that
the half million men to be called
to the colors will be trained in
sixteen cantonments, instead of
thirty-two and that many of the
forces probably would be put
into tents instead of wooden
barracks.
Expressing conGdence that
the response would be prompt
and patriotic President William
Sproule of the Southern Pacific
company issued a cail to 4j,uuu
employes to participate in the
Liberty Ijoan and announced
the railroad would advance the
required funds, re imbursement
to be made in salary deductions
over a long period .
Apache Indians in large num
bers may be secured to meet the
labor shortage in the Salt River
valley according to message re
ceived by the defense council
from Ernest Stecker, superin
tendent of the San Carlos re
servation. Persons in close
touch with the situation say from
500 to 1000 Apaches may be ob
tained for farm labor.
This week the Arlington Im
provement company sold a hand
some steer weighing 1540 pounds
for $157.08. the purchasers were
Messrs. Babbitt and Cowden
brothers of Flagstaff, Coconino
county fiom which section this
steer was shipped to Salt River
valley last November. He was
just an ordinary feeder shipped
from range to be fattened for
market.
What was planned to be the
most severe motorcycle race the
state has ever seen will be start
ed on July 1 before the Gadsden
hotel, Douglas, when the mo
torcyclist fans of the southwest
leave on their annual 700-mile
four day endurance contest for
a purse of S600. Tucson will
have the largest contingent
among the races, 25 of whom
have entered thus far.
With the mayor, common coun
cil, Chamber of Commerce, Rifle
club, safety committee, Boy
Scouts, Pioneers' Historical
society, Red Cross, Army and
Navy unions, and all other or
ganizations of the city repre
sented, the annual Flag day ex
ercises of the Klks to be held
June 14 will exceed any display
of patriotism ever marking a
similar affair in Tucson.
Recently John Began, who
buys for E. A. Tovrea Meat Co.,
at Bisbee, shipped some fat cat
tle from Yuma to butcher and
among the steers was a big
three-year old Holsteiu steer
that had been fed along with
the cows from the time he was
old enough to eat. The steer
weighed 190U pounds and
brought 10 cents. This is the
most money ever paid for a
three year old steer in Arizona.
This steer dressed 00 per cent

U. OF A. PREPARES.
Preparations to meet the naeds
of the Nation in the present e
mergeney were very much in
evidence at a recent, meeting of
the faculty of the University of
Arizona, when it was unanimous
lv agreed that all of the girls of
the institution should take u
course in domestic science, aim
ed toward food conservation,
and the senior men should study
military engineering and milita
ry geology.
With over 50,000,000 men
drawn from the productive ser
vice of the world, and the ap
parent evidence of crops not up
to standard, the University is
fullilling a real need in design
ing a course to give its students
the facts concerning the more
economical use of foods, thus
preparing teachers to dissemin
ate this information throughout
the country. It is believed that
the war will eventually bring
about a very complete difference
in our mode of living; whereas
economy has played but a small
part in the ordinary daily affairs
of the American nation, the
training that the war will bring
about will make new standards
and new ideals.
The courses in military en
gineering and geology are de
signed for the training of of
ticers, the courses including
bridge and road work, military
surveying, map making and in
terpreting, etc.
The plans of the University
for doing its part in the world's
conflict are far reaching and far
seeing they are providing for
men to fill the ranks a few years
hence rather than today.
No less important is the train
ing of young women, for the
European situation today em
phasizes the fact that the women
can and will be used in practical
ly every activity of live, and
that trained women are scarce.
A young man attending col
lege is no less enlisting for the
Nation's service than the one
shouldering a gun. Both are
equally important, one taking
six months to train and the other
several years.
MARK SMITH FOR WOMEN.
Sen. Marcus Aurelius Smith,
of Tucson, Arizona, the one dark
spot in the State so far as the
federal suffrage amendment for
women is concerned, has come
into the fold, and suffragists are
rejoicing. He stated today that
he will vote for the Susan B.
Anthony amendment, which suf
fragists are hoping to pass as a
war measure in the immediate
future.
Senator Smith's change of
heart was brought about by an
Arizona woman, Dr. Marion
Walker Williams, of Phoenix, a
member of the national advisory
council of the Woman's Party,
the suffrage organization that is
working solely for the passage
of the amendment now as a war
measure. Dr. Williams was in
the Capitol but a few hours.
She spent one of them making
the trip to the Capitol with Mrs.
William Kent of California, wife
of ex-Representative Kent, for
the express purpose of changing
Senator Smith's record for all
time.
That suffrage record of the
Senator's had been wobbling,
and Arizona women as well as
the women of other states were
beginning to get anxious for the
credit of the suffrage states; also
some of the Senator's friends
were worried for the good of the
Senator's political soul, point
ing out to him that there is al
ways a day of reckening in pol
itics, and quoting to him that
old one about ''a woman scorn
ed." So Doctor Williams' call was
timely. The Senator admitted
that he was a Kentucky gentle
man of the old school, with
States Rights' leanings, and
was preoccupied by the effect of
suffrage on his own state. "But
I have decided to vote for the
federal amendment in the Sen
ate," was his conclusion. Dr.
Williams, remembering that the
wily Senator had paired with
Elihu Root in 1914 when suf
frage was first voted on, cau
tioned him that the eye of Ariz-
! ona was upon him at least the
! feraanine eye.
Dt. Williams, after business
engagements in Baltimore and
New York, will return to Phoe
nix at the end of June.
NO SUBSTITUTES FOR DRAFTED
MEN.
One provision of the new array
bill which will command univer
sal attention and satisfaction is
j section H which provides that
! no substitute can be employed
or hired to replace men who are
j called into the country's service
! under the plan of selective con
scription.
l ms provision originated in
the House, in the form of an
amendment by Congressman
Hayden of Arizona, and was
passed by a large majority. The
Senate retained the section so
that it is now a part of the selec
tive draft law.
As passed, not only is a per
son who is subject to service
and approved by the ofticers
prohibited from hiring a sub
stitute for money or any other
valuable cansideration, but no
substitute will be permitted to
enter the army or to receive any
valuable consideration lor so
doing. The purpose is to make
every man, rich or poor, no mat
ter what bis station in life, serve
his country if he meets the phy
sical and other requirements.
And this is as it should be.
This is a war for the benefit of
the whole nation, for the cause
of freedom and democracy every
where; and there should be no
favoritism, no substituting, no
bargaining, by which one man
can hire another to do his duty
for him. Colorado Springs
Gazette.
BUY A LIBERTY BOND.
This is a message to all good
Americans from the United
States government".
That message is, '"Buy a lib
erty Bond."
It is 3'our duty and your priv
ilege. It is good Americanism and
good business.
Good Americanism because by
subscribing you will be doing
your "bit" toward making the
world "safe for democracy" as
our president has so aptly phras
ed it.
Good business, because the
bond bears 34 per cent interest
per annum, and is free from tax
ation. You can obtain a bond
for as small an amount as $50
and you do not have to pay for
it all at once.
Many a person will keep their
bonds and hand them on to their
children with pride, as mementos
of the world crisis, and as proof
that the purchaser did his "bit"
for America and for humanity.
Possibly, however, you may
need money at some time. Take
your bond to the bank and bor
row on it. it is good collateral.
Go to jrour bank tomorrow
and file your application. You
have to pay only two per cent
of the amount of your purchase.
Englishmen and Frenchmen
are doing their "bit." American
citizens, do yours! What you
do will be done for our country,
our president, for democracy,
for humanity.
Fellow citizens, let us do our
duty.
No Seed to Distribute or Sell.
No seed for free distribution
nor for sale is at the disposal of
the United States Department
of Agriculture. The department
however, through its committee
on seed stocks, is receiving daily
telegraphic and other reports as
to available supplies of seeds of
crops for late planting, and will
assist in locating seed stocks for
localities where shortage exists.
The committee is cooperating
with state, lo'al and commercial
agencies in an effort to secure
better distribution of seed and
to encourage planting of all im
portant crops.
Information regarding short
ages and surplus stocks should
be addressed to R. A. Oakley,
Chairman Committee on Seed
Stocks, Uuited States Depart
ment of Agriculture, Washing

INDIANS TO HARVEST.
Over 250 Pima Indian children
4iave pledged their services in
the harvesting of the mesquite
bean crop in this district as a
result of the personal appeal of
Dr. Mary Neff of Phoenix, who
recently addressed the Indians
on this subject. The old women
of the reservation will also join
in the movement for harvesting
the mesquite bean crop. In tha
past the Indians used the mes
quite beans for flour and fre
quently lived on it for weeks at
a time. The younger Indians,
however, never gathered the
beans and allowed them to go to
waste. The beans when ripe
make valuable horse feed and
are good feed for hogs, cows
and other stock. They may be
made into poultry food, it is be
lieved. The matter of finding a
market for the beans in the Salt
River Valley is being taken up
by the flour mills and packing
houses in Phoenix and investi
gation as to the manner in which
they can be used to supplement
the food supply is being made.

-"'REGISTERED 'AND READY."
The -Parade -andj Loyalty Exercises
Grer.t Success.
"Registered and Ready, No
Kales, Arizona, .lane. a, 1917."
That's the slogan presented to
about two hundred patriotic
younR Americans of Nogales
who last Tuesday declared them
selves ready and willing to serve
our Uncle Sam. lioth the ban
ner and the lovely young lady
who made the presentation, will
always be pleasantly remember
ed by the lucky eligible.
Of the To7 eligible who re
gistered in Nogales, about 55
per cent were aliens.
However, there were no de
monstrations of any kind and
the day passed off without an
un-patriotic incident being re
corded to mar the "greated day
in American history."
The big parade in the after
noon, followed by patriotic ex
ercises at the Nogales Theatre,
was the most interesting feature
of the day.
Promptly at three o'clock the
procession was formed by Mar
shal of the Day, Captain Chas.
Beatty, veteran of the Spanish
American war.
Headed by the 35th Infantry
band and the famous Tenth Cav
alrymen, mounted, followed by
hundreds of American patriots
carrying America flags, in auto
mobiles and on loot, the long
procession marched proudly
through the principal streets.
Civil and Spanish-American war
veterans rode in automobiles
which were appropriately de
corated with the national colors.
The squads of young men "Re
gistered and Ready," The Elks
and Citizens, were features of
the parade, which was without
a doubt the most patriotic, im
pressive ever seen in Nogales.
At the conclusion of the par
ade, hundreds of patriotic citi
zens and visitors in the city
thronged the Nogales Theatre,
which had been generously don
ated for the occasion by Frank
Diamos, where the following ex
cellent program was rendered :
Song, "Star Spangled Ban
ner," Ladies' Chorus; Invoca
tion, Rev. George C. Golden;
Song, "Battle Hymn of the Re
public," Ladies' Chorus; opening
address, by the chairman, Col.
A. T. Bird; Song, "Columbia
the Gem of the Ocean," Ladies'
Chorus; Patriotic Address, Judge
W. A. O'Connor; Song, "Amer
ica," Ladies' Chorus; Closing
Address, Col. Chas. E. Hardy
The Loyalty Exercises closed
with the nlavintr of the Star
Spangled Banner," by the band,
during which the audiance stood
at attention.
BIG LOYALTY MEETING.
The bif? Loyalty Meeting, in
honor of the young men of No
gales eligible for registration,
held last Monday evening, under
the auspices of the Nogales
Chamber of Commerce, thanks
to Robert E. Lee and other en
thusiastic members of the Enter
tainment Committee, was a great
success in every way.
An interesting patriotic pro
gram was carried out to the de
light of all, after which refresh
ments were served.
The arrival at the hall of Un
cle Sara and his Italian, English,
French and Russian allies, was
the hit of the evening.
Colonel Allen T. Bird, Amer
ican Consul E. M. Lawton, Col
onel Frier and Rev. G. C. Golden
furnished the patriotic oratory,
which was greatly appreciated
by the large audiance.
The musical program consist
ed of piano and vocal solos by
Mr. Lazelle and C. O. Bartlett;
also a song, "Don't Bite the
Hand That's Feeding You," by
Mr. Durfee, which received
hearty applause, especially from
the young men eligible for re
gistration. The Tenth Cavalry
Quartette and Monroe brothers,
were well received by the laige
appreciative audiance.
The entertainment closed with
the "Star Spangled Banner."
Last Saturday Antonio Here
dia and Zacharias Paez, arrest
ed some time ago on a federal
charge of attempting to smuggle
Jananese residents of Sonora,
into Arizona, at this port, were
convicted in the federal court at
Tucson, and each fined $400.
They paid the fines.
LEGARRA DID GOOD WORK.
Popular Manager of The Red House
and Others Complimented.
J. A. Legarra, manager of the
Red House is to be complimented
for his excellent patriotic work
today and for his work on the
registration committee, says
Tuesday's H e ra 1 d .
Mr. Legarra is responsible for
the badges, "Registered and
Ready," which were pinned upon
the oligibles by the Misses Wise,
Sykes, Wylie, Bowman, O'Neill
and Legarra. He was also part
ly responsible for the flag which
was given each young man who
registered. Mr. Legarra was on
the job early this morning and
his assistance is appreciated
greatly by the people as a
whole.
Young Mexican men of this
city in large numbers register
ed. It was surprising the way
these yountr men answered the
call of the United States. In fact
many of them expressed their
intentions of joining the army
if they were not called in the
first draft.
The Chamber of Commerce
t - r t I
comes in lor its snare oi me
praise while it is being handed
out. The members appointed
on the special committee have
worked unfalteringly and the
fruits of their labor are being
enjoyed, not only by the young
men who registered, but by the
entire city. Many meetings have
been held, all of which were
well attended.
Y. M. C. A. SOCIAL.
The social given by the ladies
of the various churches in the
city, at the central Y. M. C. A.
hut. last Thursday evening in
honor of the American soldiers,
was a most enjoyable affair, at
tended by many citizens and
soldiers.
