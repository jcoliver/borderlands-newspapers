Council of Defense Asks All Citizens
to Co-Operate.
The Arizona Council of De
fense, in session assembled at
Phoenix, April 18th, issued to
the people of Arizona, the follow
ing message:
"The Arizona Council of De
fense, in session assembled, calls
upon every individual in Arizona
to stand shoulder to shoulder in
united determination successful
ly to meet, the critical conditions
now threatening our State and
Nation.
'"The urged need today is Con
servation. Let all co operate in
prudent economy in the home,
in our social life and general ac
tivities. "Our food supply demands
special consideration. All waste
in the preparation and use of
food must be eliminated. Wher
ever possible, perishable foods
should be used in perference to
staple products and canned
goods. The livestock industry
must be conserved. We urge
the various associations repres
enting this industry to co oper
ate to this end.
"We recommend thatour mer
chants, wholesalers, jobbers and
retailers, take such action as will
prevent all unwarranted or ar
bitrary increases in prices of
food commodities. Individual
hoarding and accummulating of
food is pernicious. Such a prac
tice is not only of great inj-ury
to the majority of our citizens
who are compelled from necessi
ty to buy supplies from day to
day, but, in the end reacts on
those who indulge in that form
of selfishness. We call upon
every individual to discourage
this practice, not only by pre
cept, but by his own manly ex
amply. "The planting season for sum
mer crops is now upon us.
Every effort must be made to
bring all available land under
cultivation. Waste places must
be made to bear subsistence.
Each member of the Council
pledges himself to plant, or
cause Co be planted, a plot of
ground not- hitherto under cul
tivation. Our seed supply must
be guarded, and the best avail
able seed planted. Conditions
are such that high prices are
likely to prevail for sometime to
come, and our best effort to min
imize this condition must be put
forth vigorously.
"Other resources in this State
are very essential to the welfare
of our country. Not only must
all forms of agriculture be pro
moted, but war conditions today
demand that the organization
and maintenance of all essential
industries be kept in a high
state of efficiency. Our mineral
resources must be fostered and
developed to provide materials
for war. All industrial activities
must be maintained at their
greatest capacities.
"We call upon all aliens among
us to unite with our citizens in
promoting the public good. Let
us be considerate of those who
have been subjects of nations
with which we are now at war.
It is vitally important that every
individual shall realize his duty,
by loyally obeying and uphold
ing the law. Do not carry arms
unless you have the right to do
so. Do not kindle or repeat idle
rumors and gossip. Give aid
and assistance to the officers of
the law to enable them to main
tain public peace and order.
Remember that disregard of law
is reprehensible at any time:
today it is treasonable.
"Every effort should be made
to support the President in his
plans for National defense. En
courage the organization of out
National Guard; army and navy;
safeguard tne rights of our sold
iers and sailors and their depen
dents, so that the burden may
rest as lightly as possible upon
those who offer their lives in the
defense of all.
"We recommend all necessary
legislation to the end that the
burdens of the war shall be
equitably borne by all. Let not
this be a war by the patriotic
few for the benefit of the many.
We especially commend the
President's plan for universal
military service.
"The demand of the hour is
united, intelligent and immediate
1 action. We call noon everv
commercial body, labor organiza
tion, church, benevolent, secret
and patriotic society; in short,
all associations of every kind
and character within the State,
at once to perfect plans and me
thods lor promoting the efforts
of this Council for U;g safety of
our State and Nation. Service
in the ranks of the National
Guard, army and navy is noble
and patriotic. Unselfish service
as a private citizen is no less so.
With confidence in the patriotism
of the citizens and residents of
Arizona, we ask that every man,
woman and child unite in public
spirited effort to uphold the
peace, honor and welfare of
Arizona and the Union.
"This Council is permanently
organized. The necessary com
mittees are now actively at work.
Suggestions and assistance from
any source will be cordially re
ceived. Addiess, Dwight B.
Heard, Chairman, Arizona State
Council of Defense, or George
H. Smalley, Secretary, State
Capitol, Phoenix, Arizona.
"We ask the press and clergy
to aid in carrying this message
to the people."
U. S. Navy Enlisting Party Conning.
The U. S. Navy Traveling Re
cruiting Party, with Chief Water
Tender J. C. Piper in charge,
under the command of Lieut. S.
P. Tracht, of the El Paso re
cruiting district, is visiting cities
in Arizona, New Mexico and
Texas, distant from the seaboard
and not within easy reach of a
permanently located navy re
cruiting base, in interest of ad
vertising and recruiting for
"Uncle Sam's" first line cf de
fense the navy.
Men between 17 and 30 years
of age w;ho are citizens of the
United States of sound mental
and physical condition, good
moral character, and able to
read and write the English lan
guage, are wanted for the Navy.
The term of enlistment for
men 18 to thirty' years of age is
four years; for those between 17
and 18 years of age enlistment is
for term of minority.
Pay ranges from 17 00 a
month for apprentice seamen
aDd landsmen, to about 100 per

with board and lodging and free

S. P. TO AID FARMERS.
I. T. Sparks, traveling freight
and passenger agent of the
Southern Pacific railroad, will
do all in his power to further
the increase in food crops along
the line of the Southern Pacific.
Before his departure for Doug
las yesterday afternoon. Mr.
Sparks made the following state
ment: "Dry farmers who wish seed
and are unable to buy them or
who have pumping plants and
are not financially able to buy
oil to operate them, should write
me at Tucson and make their
wants known. I will see that
their applications are placed be
fore the proper authorities.
Ability to handle crops must be
shown. In their communications
to me, farmers should state the
number of acres they can culti
vate and whether the soil is
adapted for beans or milo maize."
Tucson Star.
YOUR CHOICE OF JOBS IN ARMY
"Come early if you want to
get your your pick of jobs in the
army," said Corporal Hacker,
recruiting officer for the U. S. A.
"It seems probable that after
May 1, we won't have anything
left but the infantry. That is to
say, under compulsory service
men will be accepted only for
the infantry.
"Now a recruit may have his
choice of the infantry, cavalry,
signal corps, coast artillery, hos
pital corps, and aviation section
of signal corps.
"Colored men will be accepted
for either infantry or cavalry.
Heretofore only previous service
men could enlist and were re
quired to enlist in the same ser
vice as that from which they
were discharged." Citizen.

Experience Is the
Test of Tires
Every tire claims to be the lowest-cost-per-mile
tire.
If you knew the experience of any considerable
number of other tire users,
that would help you decide which tire makes
good on the claim.
We don't know about other makes of tires, but we
do know
that motorists who have used United States Tires
continue to use them;
that more and more motorists who used other
makes of tires are turning to United States Tires.
These two facts are proved by the amazing sales
increases of United States Tires
sales increases that are vastly greater than even
the greater natural increase in the number of automo
biles this year over last
-which shows where tire service is.
