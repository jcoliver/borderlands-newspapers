'DAD" MOUER RE-APPOINTED.
In recognition of the efficient
service rendered by the official
during - his term oj office, the
state land board has re elected
William Mouer to the position
of state land commissioner. The
action of the board comes as a
surprise in view of the fact that
a rumor has been current about
the capital for several days re
garding a change that was con
templated in the administration
of this office.
An unusual feature of the
election of Mr. Mouer lies in the
fact that the incubent's term of
office bad not yet expired. His
election, it was stated, was ac
complished to quiet the rumors
of a prospective change and to
put an end to the holitical log
rolling that has been carried on
in an effort to secure the place
for a score of aspirants.
Mr. Mouer first assumed the
duties of this office in July, 1915,
at the time of the adoption of
the revised land code. He has
served continuously as land com
missioner since that time.
DON'T STARVE CATTLE.
It is short sighted policy to
starve cattle by attempting to
maintain them in depleted fall
pastures. This practice is com
mon in western range states. It
is unjust because it is inhumane,
and it is unwise because it is un
profitable. Although animals suffer less
than man, they none the less
suffer. Patial starvation is
agonizing in the extreme. Aside
from this, it causes stockmen to
lose money.
When the cattle come off sum
mer pastures they are usually
in good condition. They are
then turned into the fields to
pick up what could not begath
ered during the harvest. This
is desirable both in order to save
the feed which would otherwise
be wasted. High price of feed
tempt owners to delay feeding
as long as possible. This is not
wise, because cattle lose fies'h
rapidly.
Experienced feeders know on
ly too well that it is more diffi
cult to get flesh back on animals
than it is to keep them in good
condition and it is also much
more expensive than to avoid its
loss. It is not profitable to keep
cattle fat, but they should be
kept strong and vigorous.
Weak animals die at spring
calving. When cows die, their
calves, too, either die or else
are saved with extreme diffi
culty. Peed that the dead ani
mals have eaten is lost. Had
these animals been sold or kill
ed in the fall and the hay fed to
other animals, these others
would have been in better con
dition. Salt Lake News.

Farmers Are Breaking Ground.
A recent dispatch from Bisbee
says: More moisture has fallen
in San Pedro valley this winter
than in the entire year previous,
according to G. J. McCabe, who
arrived in Bisbee from his ranch.
As a result farmers have begun
breaking ground for the pur
pose of conserving the moisture
from the heavy snows, and to
store it in the ground until the
planting season.
Mr. McCabe said that the
farmers had not been able to
plow last year until the summer
rains had fallen and even then I
many of them could do little
plowing.
The snowfall has been bouuti- I

parts of the valley-a mantle of i

Cattlemen and farmers alike are
delighted at the outlook for a I
prosperous season.

COAST-TO-COAST HIGHWAY.
Arizona is shortly to be visit
ed by the pathfinding committee
appointed to investigate the
feasibilty of a federal highway
through this state from El Paso
to Los Angeles, constructed un
der the provisions of the Bank
head federal aid act. Mr. R. A.
Kirk, of Phoenix, is in receipt
of a telegram stating that the
committee will arrive there in
the course of a few days.
The highway through this
state will follow the old Border
land route if the recommendac
tion of the pathfinders is favor
able. Among the important
points on the route are Tucson,
Bisbee and Douglas. Arrange
ments have been made in Phoe
nix to entertain the committee
and supply the members with
data relative to the desirability
of this plan and an effort is be-
rng made to have the other cities
and counties affected co operate
in this endeavor.
Prompt actiou is necessary
since the survey must be made
and reported before the third
annual convention cf the asso
ciation occurs. This will take
place at Mineral Wells. Texas,
April 18 19, at which time the
location of the highway through
the southwest will be definitely
fixed. i
Returning Soldiers Should Register.
Much interest ,in being taken
by a number of returned soldiers
in the proposed soldier settle
program, so far as Arizona is
concerned.
The task of collecting infor
mation regarding land resources
has begun in all of the counties
in the State, and the Committee
hopes to have data revised and
compiled at an early date.
It is requested by the Com
mittee that all soldiers who de
sire to settle upon Arizona lands
wfTl register their names and ad
dress with the secretary, Alfred
C. SieUbld, at the State Land
Department, State House, Phoe
nix, Arizona.

Regarding Same.
Advice
The following communication
to the Nogales Chamber of Com
merce, from Hon. Wirt G. Bow
man, "Santa Cruz county's repre
sentative in the State Legisla
ture, now in session, is self ex
planatory :
Gentlemen :
Bearing in mind the fact that
I have greatly at heart the in
terests of every man. woman and
child in Santa Cruz county, I
wish to respectfully remind each
person in the county of the vital
importance involved in- their
looking to their own interests,
as well as expecting me to do
so, during the present session of
the State Legislature.
Doubtlessly the people of No
gales and Santa Cruz county
are aware of the fact that bills
are being introduced in the
House daily affecting every citi
zen of said town and county.
Also, no doubt, they have notic
ed in the daily press, the ap
proach in the House for passage,
of the McKay Minimum Wage
Bill. I am of the opinion that
every mercoant in JNogales is
vitally interested in this Bill.
Notwithstanding this fact, up to
the present time, I am the re
cipient of one telegram in pro
test. Fearing, therefore, that my
people are somewhat oblivious
to the vas,t importance attached
to each and every Bill that is in
troduced in this House, I would
strongly urge that a meeting of
the Chamber of Commerce be
called at once, for a general dis
cussion of the McKay Bill, noti
fying me without delay the
wishes of the majority, giving
arguments for and against. I
would also like to have each and
every citizen of Santa Cruz
county remember that they have
sent me here to represent them,
and while I will always use my
best judgment as to voting on
what is or is not best for the
people of the state, I truly hope
they thoroughly understand that
all men are open to mistakes,
and two heads are often better
than one.
I will give careful attention to
letters or suggestions from my
constituents. What- I wish to
avoid, is that should my judg
ment be in error, while here,
due to the fact that I have to
shoulder the load alone, the peo
pie should think I have not done
my duty. Very sincerely,
Wirt G. Bowman.
Good Work of Firemen Prevent Great
Loss of Property.
Prompt and efficient work on
the part of the Nogales Fire De
partment early last Monday
morning, undoubtedly prevented
the loss of hundreds of thous
ands of dollars worth of Nogales
busines and residence property.
About two thirty o'clock fire,
caused by a servant overturning
a small coal oil heater, started
in the Brickwood Hotel, and
the flames spread so quickly
throughout the upper story of
the building, a number of guests
were compelled to jump to the
street, leaving( their personal
effects behind.'
The tire department, under
the personal direction of Chief
Lsracey (Jurtis and his able assist
I ants, A. S. Noon, Harry Ren
shaw, H. M. Clagett, and others
of that bravfi crew of lire fight
ers, within a few mintes after
the alarm sounded, had seven
powerful streams of water play
ing.on the flames, and oceans of
water was pouring to the lower
lloor occupied by The First Na
tional Bank of Nogales, and
Herold & Tid well's clothing
store.
Each and every member of the
volunteer tire department, which
is socond to none in the south
west, did excellent work in con
fining the flames to the top floor
of the Brickwood Hotel build
ing, which was damaged to the
extent of about $15,000. In
surance, S9.000.
Located as it is, between the
Montezuma and National hotels,
hwith adjacent property valued
at many hundred thousand dol
lars, the Brickwood had to be
saved from .total destruction,
and the fire lads did the job in
record-breaking time.
The loss by water, to the bank
and haberdas'hry, has not been
made public. Phil and Bill had
the evening before ju-st complet
ed the installation of elegant
new fixtures, costing between
three and four thousand dollars.
Their loss will amount to sev
eral thousand dollars.

TOVAR.
J. Conrado Tovar, whose Ben
efit Piano recital ia announced
for Monday evening, January
27th at 8:30 o'clock, at The Lyric
Theatre, is unquestionably the
representative piano virtuoso of
Mexico.
This artist has just completed
a tour of Mexico, where he gave
64 concerts, visiting practically
every city in the Republic, and
he has the indorsements of the
press and the public wherever
he appeared.
In his recital for Monday night
he will include in his programme,
compositions from Chopin, Ru
benstein, Debussy, Poldini, to
gether with s)me masters prac
tically new to this country, viz:
Grovelez, Albinez and Granados.
This in itself will be a musical
treat to the people of Nogales,
from the fact that Tovar is a
pupil of Granados, who in tarn
was a pupil of Albinez; so Tovar
has had the advantage of ac
quiring the interpretations of
these wonderful compositions
just as the composers intended
them to be interpretered. His
interpretations of these unique
and quaint classic numbers is an
achievement that can only be
acquired by long and tedious
practice under tutelage of mast
ers who can impart their in
spirations of the song stories so
unusual and colorful, that to
hear them, ope is impressed with
the wTonderf ul light and shadows
so beautifully blended in these
compositions, and Tovar seems
to grasp and live every mood in
his rendition of them.
Mrs. A. M. Gillespie will assist
Mr. Tovar in the form of a so
prano solo, and to the public of
Nogales, it is oeedless to men
tion that this popular soprano
soloist will contribute very much
to the artistic value of an elab
orate programme.
Mr. Tovar is about to begin a
two years tour of the United
States and Canada, with Cuba
and South America to follow.

With the return of peace A morion Is
Confronted by a fowl problem even
harder of solution than that with
which we coped in time. of war. We
have an entirely new world situation
In food. It will mean essentlul change
In our domestic program, liat more
Important than this. It u:.:; of neces
sity require increased cipcrr. -
Last year we shipped 11,820.000 tons
of foodstuffs to the Kuropean Allies.
.Had the war continued we would have
increased this enormous figure to 17,
650,000 tons in the present year. Now,
with the responsibility of feeding mil
Ions of people liberated from the Ger
man yoke, our exports must be brought
up to at least 20,000.000 tons prac
tically the limit of loading cipaoify at
ur ports.
S. -
World rood Demand Increased.
1 The end of the war will create an
enormously Increased demand for food.
Humanity demands that the starving
millions freed from Prussian oppres
sion shall have sufficient supplies to
assure their return to health xtiil pros
perity. If these liberated Rations are
faced with starvation they cannot es
tablish orderly governments. Hunger
breeds anarchy in a people. The war
to free the world for democracy will
be lost after it has been woo. Amer
ica must continue its work to libera
tion and by sharing its fjJKl make de
mocracy safe in the world. "r
In order to meet this new situation
the Food Administration has made a
careful survey of the food resources of
the whole world in relation to the to
tal demands. Computing supplies on
the basis of the avoidance of waste
and war consumption, it is found that
wheat and rye may be obtained in suf
ficient quantities to meet economical
world consumption ; high protein feed
for dniry animals will show a shortage
of about 3.000,000 tons, while there
will be sufficient supplies of other
feeds to allow economical consump
tion; beans, peas anUfrice will also be
found in sufficient qnnntlties to main
tain economy in consumption ; tUere
are sufficient supplies of beef to keep
pace with the capacity of refrigerating
,'space.
!' Great Fat Shortage.
The most distinct reversal of policy
will come with pork and dairy prod
ucts, vegetable oils, sugar and coffee.
.Utmost economy will be required In
itlie use of fats and oils, in which there
ds a world shortage of about 3.000,000,
tOOO pounds. Inere are sufficient sup
plies for us to return to our normal
ugar consumption if ether nations
'Continue their present short rations,
-or even if their rations are slightly in
creased. If the Kuropean countries,
however, are to resume their normal
sugar consumption it will he through
our continued conservation in order
to share with them. There is a sur
plus of coffee.
Of the world total required to pro
duce these results North America will
furnish more than tttl per cent. The
United States, including the West ln
Us, will be in a position to furnish
a total of about 20.000.000 tons
against our pre-war exports of about
,00O,OO0 tons.
The bread grains situation allows
'the world to abandon the use of sub
stitutes in wheat bread. Large sup
plies have accumulated in the Argen
tine, Australia and other hitherto In
accessihle markets. A continued high
milling percentage, economy of con
sumption and elimination of waste
make it possible for the world to re
turn to a white wheat loaf.
Of all our export possibilities In
fats, the largest and most important
Item is pork. While we cannot supply
the world deficiency, will be able
to help it enormously because of the
past policies of stimulating production
and restraining consumption. The
government's policy with regard to
stimulating the production of wheat
and of pork, the readiest source of
fats, is thus amply justified by the sit
uation upon the return of peace.
Famine Specter Still Stalks.
The people of the United States
must continue care and wise economy
in the use of food in order to complete
the work of liberating the World. But
even with tiie utmost conservation and
production in this country there will
he in Europe for the next year or more
Starvation beyond all human power to
allay. In North Russia there are 40,
000,000 people to whom food cannot
be made accessible this winter. Their
transportation is demoralized in com
plete anarchy. And even If internal
transport can be assured their ports of
entry would soon be frozen. Millions
more who have felt keenly the oppres
sion of war will be beyond reach of as
sistance. We must realize that upon our
shoulders rests a greater responsibili
ty than we have ever before been
asked to assume. We must realize that
millions of lives depend absolutely
xupou the continued service and sacri

Why Putter With
Ooras? Use Gets-tt
Common-Sense, Simple, Never Fails.
Yon can tear out your corns and suf
fer, or you can peel off your corns and
smile. The joy - peeling way la the
"Gets-It" way. It is the only happy,
palaleaa way In the world. Two Uropn

nd the Cora la "Goner"! ;
of "Gets-It" on any corn or callus dries
at once. The corn llna-lly loosens off
from the toe, so that you can peel It
off with your fingers in one piece, pain
lessly, like peeling a banana. "Great
stuff, wish I'd done that before." There
only one corn-peeler "Gets-It." Toes
wrapped up big with tape and band
ages, toes sqnlrmlng from irritating
salves, it's all a barbarity. Toes .wounded
by razors and fcnives, that's butchery,
ridiculous, unnecessary, dangerous. Use
"Gets-It," the liberty way simple,
painless, always sure. Take no chances.
Get "Gets -It." Don't be insulted by
imitations. See that you get "Gets-It."
"Gets-It," the guaranteed, money
back corn-remover, the only sura
way, costs but a trifle at any drug store.
