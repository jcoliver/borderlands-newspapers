ARIZONA NOTES.
Items of Interest Culled From Our
Exchanges.
That Graham county will not
have a fair this year was the
decision of the fair commission
at .a meeting in Safford Satur
day last.
Approximately twenty -- five
thousand dollars for premiums
on the general exhibits in the
various departments of the Ari
zona State Fair this year. This
apart from the races. How
much are you going after on en
tries? The peace advocates are
American citizens, but they run
so low grade in red blood that
they attract but little attention
and create no excitement. They
are the flotsam and jetsam of
American citizenship. Winslow
Mail.
The boys have gone to war
but visitors to the State Fair
this year need have no worry
about prosection. Captain Tom
Rynning has accepted responsi
bility for their welfare and three
companies of Home Guards will
be at his disposal if needed.
Membership of the American
Red Cross has reached the 3,
500v000 mark and is increasing
at the rate of 25,000 to 100,000 a
day, according to an announce
ment sent out from Washington
headquarters. At the beginning
of the year the total was 275,
000 members.
Oscar C. Cole, former secre
tary at the state prison, was
called to the colors, under the
selective draft. He made no
application for exemption al
though he leaves a wife and
three small children, the oldest
but five years old. He went
with the first contingent.
Prom the way the European
cattle herds are being depleted
by the war, America won't be
able to supply any where near
the number of live stock they
are going to need in the future.
It behooves all American live
stock people to hold up all the
breeding stock they can possibly
get feed for.
Favorable report was made
Friday by the senate committee
at Washington on the bill by
Senator Jones of New Mexico,
authorizing the secretary of the
interior to designate lands in
Arizona, New Mexico, Colorado,
Wyoming, North and South Da
kota and Nevada to be used for
grazing purposes.
R. W. Kramer, for the past
year ana a nan assistant; at
torney geaeral of Arizona,
Saturday tendered his resigna
tion to Attorney General Wiley
E. Jones. Mr. Kramer's resigna
tion will go into effect October 1,
when he will be identified with
the well known law firm of Arm
strong and Lewis.
When American soldiers go to
the war front they go with the
assurance that not only they
themselves, but their depend
ents will be looked after by the
American Red Cross. To bridge
the gap between home aud army
camp, tne -cea uross win serve
in the dual capacity of protector
and medical assistant.
There is no country like Ari
zona. A ary iarmer living aiew
miles from Benson, after return
ing home from town a few days
ago, was beginning to prepare
his evening meal, and opening
the door of his cook stove, found
a well-done bird inside, which
had flown down the chimney,
and get into the bake oven. No,
there s no country like Arizona.
The campaigns for canning,
drying, and otherwise preserv
ing foods under way in all the
northern and western states are
doing much to insure a supply
of food for winter use, and
should be continued through the
fall. Special attention should
be given at this time to make
fruit butters, such as peach but
ter, quince butter, and apple
butter, and no family should
relax effort in canning and dry
ing until every pantry sneit is
filled with canned, dried, and
preserved food products.
Cotton growers of Maricopa
county will, during the next few
months, receive about five mil
lion dollars for their long staple
Egyptian cotton. The acreage
is 31,000 acres and it is thought
this will produce about 17,000
bales of cotton, 500 pounds to
the bale. This at 60 cents a
pound will bring in the neigh
borhood of five million. Picking
has already begun and it will be
a continuous performance until
in January.
Judge John A. Ellis of the
Superior Court of Mohave
county, is being considered for
appointment as a federal judge
of a new United States district
court, embracing the northern
tier of counties in Arizona, ac
cording to word from Washing
ton tnis week. The movement
is said to have been favorably
considered at the national capi
tal. It is known that the bar of
the several northern counties
are almost unanimous in advo
cating the appointment of Judge
Ellis. Miner.
The Florence postoffice and
the office and printing plant of
the Florence Blade Tribune were
destroj-ed by fire last Saturday.
The loss is estimated at about
$10,000, partially covered by in
surance. The fire originated in
the printing plant, having start
ed, it is believed, from thergas
engine used to furnish power.
Owing to the lack of a water
system, the only m.eans at hand
was the chemical extinguisher
cart and when this was brought,
it was found that the apparatus
had been left uncharged.
The U boat peril has ceased to
give serious concern. It will
doubtless remain a plague while
the war lasts; but the govern
ment is confident of being able
to hold it witin limits. We shall
be able to send meir and ma
terials across the sea without
fatal hinderance. Only one Amer
ican steamship out of 200 has
been sunk by a submarine since
we entered the war. In no case
have the Germans succeeded in
sinking a fast or big ship. They
have merely picked off a few
slow tankers and freigters.
Adjutant General Harris has
received from the department
definite information that the
First Arizona Infantry regiment
would be filled out with drafted
men from this state. It was
feared for a time especially since
the selected men had been sent
to Fort Riley and the First Ari
zona had been ordered to Linda
Vista, that the regiment would
be filled but by drafted men
from other states nearer canton
ments, so that the regiment,
though bearing the name of the
First Arizona, would be made
up in considerable part of men
who are not residents of the
state.
The Yuma weather observer
noticed a freak in the elements
Monday which probably has not
occurred since Heck was a pup.
It consisted in the highest tem
perature of the day occurring at
five o'clock a. m., and the lowest
at five o'clock p. m. The former
was 83 degrees and the latter
76.8. The fact that five o'clock
in the forenoon and five in the
afternoon saw "upper and ne
ther" is not the whole feature.
Perhaps never before has the
hottest period of any one day
been as early in the morning.
But this September has been
freakish all thru so far. Tne
relative humidity Monday was
79, the highest in many moons.
Yuma Sun.
Secretary Winn, of the local
draft board, is in receipt of a
registration card from Morris D.
Glessuer, who is in far off Chile,
South America. The man lived
in Yuma and was for a long time
an employe of the reclamation
service, leaving one year ago
for the southern clime ia search
of fortune. He was rigistered
by the American consul at the
place where he lives, and it took
the card within a few days of a
month to get here. If another
call for soldiers is made and this
man should be drawn it would
be necessary for him to make a
trip of about 15,000 miles to re
spond to the call of good old
Uncle Sam. He did not claim
exemption. Sun.
Con P. Cronin has been desig
nated by the War Department
as director of the Amercan Li
brary Association whose object
is to provide adequate library
facilities for the soldiers in all
the training camps and canton
ments in the country. It is pro
posed to raise a million dollars
for the purchase of a million
books for the soldiers. Through
the local libraries all oyer the
country it is soliciting books and
magazines, but it is not expected
that enough will be secured by
donations. Therefore the sec
retary of war has appointed a
library war council of ten mem
bers, with Frank A. Vanderlip
of New York, as chairman, to
aid the association in raising the
$1,000,000 fund.
Dr. A. J. Chandler of Chandler
has let the contract to J. W.
Martin of Los Angeles for the
building of a sufficient number
of concrete, ditches to irrigate
5, 000 acres of land lying just
west of the 3,000 acres put in
this year by the Southwest Cot
ton company. The successful
establishment of the 3000 acre
unit planted to cotton necessi
tates this additional investment
and means that a vast acreage
of last year's desert country will
add its share to the sustaining
of families and adding to the
values of every acre of land and
every town lot in the Salt River
valley, the latter for the reason
that the venture has shown
what can be done in the desert-
with money and nerve.
FOREST RANGERS NEEDED.
The Civil Service Commission
has announced that an examina
tion for the position of Forest
Ranger will be held on or about
October 29, at all Forest head
quarters in New Mexico and
Arizona. Persons desiring to
take this examination may se
cure blank application forms
No. 304 from the Civil Service
Commission, Washington, D. C,
from Forest Supervisors, or by
addressing the District Forester,
Albuquerque, N. M. These
should be executed and forward
ed to the office of the Civil Ser
vice Commission, Washington,
D. C, as early as possible in
order that applicants may re
ceive admission cards prior to
the examination. Cattleman.
Game Season Open Oct. I.
The deer and turkey season
this year opends October 1 and
closes November 1, with a bag
limit of one deer with horns and
two turkeys. For severaf years
the open season has been from
October 1 to December 15. but
the- voters last fall decided by
ballots that the season was too
long and the limit too high. In
California the season is a month
and a half and the limit two
bucks.
The interest in big game shoot
is increasing each year. Owing
to the short season, many hunt
ers will likely be out at the
opening.
Shooters should not overlook
the fact that the quaTl season
does not open until October 15th.
and that the country is full of
game wardens and that the real
sportsmen have decided this
year to turn in every person
they learn of who kills quail
before October 15th.
NOTICE FOR PUBLICATION.
DEPARTMENT OP THE INTERIOR,

Arizona, Sept. 1, 1917.

CONSERVE LIVE STOCK.
Supt. J. W. Williams, of the
Arizona Eastern Railroad, has
issued the following regarding
the conservation of live stock;
Do you know that thousands
of horses, mules, cattle, hogs
and sheep are killed annually by
railway trains in the country,
and that this economic waste,
approximately many millions of
dollars, can be reduced?
The thousands of horses and
mules that are killed every year
would fill the artillery require
ments of many regiments, and
the thousands of cattle, hogs
and sheep that are killed every
year would provide meat for
thousands of soldiers?
Anyone who aids in prevent
ing the loss of even one animal
serves his country patriotically
and effectually.
This economic waste can be
reduced by:
Owners of stock keeping their
stock in fenced enclosures and
not permiting their stock to
roam at large on railroad right
of way.
Town officers passing ordin
ances prohibiting the practice of
permitting stock to roam at
large.
Superintendents, roadmasters
and section men making a per
sonal appeal to the owners of
stock to keep their animals ia
fenced enclosures.
Engineers taking every pre
caution., within their power to
avoid striking stock and never
failing to report stock seen on
right of way.
Section men driving stock off
right of way, keeping farm
gates closed, and fences and cat
tle guards in good repair, giving
preference to locations where
liability of stock getting on right
of way is greatest.
Everyone making a persist
ent, personal effort to bring
about desired results. The co
operation of all concerned will
be thoroughly appreciated.
Too many cattle are being kill
ed on this division, and I am
sure that if our engineers, sec
tion foremen and our good
friends living along the line will
observe the suggestion contain
ed in the circular herein quoted,
this unnecessary loss and con
sequent waste can be almost, if
not quite eliminated.
J. W. Williams, Supt.
Uncle Sam wants soldiers fit
and firm, and an officers' train
ing camp is no place for any but
the most resolute, according to
F. C. Blodgett, of Kingman,
who is now at Camp Funston,
Leon Springs, Texas, rounding
in shape for the front in France.
Mr. Blodgett writes the Miner
that "there is nothing lady-like
about the work," that it is a case
of the "survival of the fittest."
Besides going through all kinds
of drills and camp maneuvers,
those trying for the army com
missions must do long hikes
with full equipment, weighing
42 pounds. Blodgett was order
ed to train as infantry and out
of 172 men, he was second choice
for two promotions.

"GOOD BYE AND GOOD LUCK."
Santa Cruz County Fighting Men Off
to Training Camp.
"Good bye and good luck."
The farewell given the second
contingent of tnirty eight men
who last Wednesday went from
Santa Cruz county to join the
great National Army at Fort
Kiley, Kansas, will never be for
gotten by the brave boys or
hundreds of their relatives and
friends, who were there to wish
''our boys" God speed.
Prom every district in the
county hundreds of citizens came
to assist in making the "fare
well one of the biggest and best
ever. Ip was.
Under the personal supervis
ion of J. A. Legarra, chairman
of the Decoration Committee,
Nogales' streets" had been de
corated as they never were de
corated. Old Glory and red and
white pennets were everywhere,
presenting a most pleasing ef
fect. Chairman Legarra was
assisted by Leslie Hardy, John
J. Raphael and Steve Moreno.
Shortly after one o'clock, Mar
shal of the Parade, Captain Li.
W. Mix. and his assistants,
Bracey Curtis, Virt G. Bowman,
G. H. Madden, Rev. Father Van
Goethen and T. J. Wylie, got
the mammoth pacriotic parade
started. Nothing like it was
ever seen in Nogales.
The line of march was from
the Town Hall, south on Grand
avenue to Internation street,
thence easterly to Morley ave.,
thence northerly on Morley
avenue to Court street, thence
westerly to Grand avenue, and
thence southerly to the Town
Hall and past it to the open
space where the lines were
formed to the special Pullman
car provided by patriotic citizens
for the comfort of the boys on
their trip to Fort Riley.
Leading the parade was the
35th Infantry band followed by
Company "A" of the 35th in
command of Captain McCoombs.
Following the military escort
was Marshal of the Parade,
Captain L. W. Mix, Sheriff R.
R. Earhart and Mayor H. M.
Clagett.
Then came Nogales' company
of Boy Scouts, handsome and
sturdy little fellows carrying a
big American flag.
Next headed by Marshal Cur
tis and members of the Selective
Draft Board. James D. Barry,
Dr. W. F. Chenoweth and At
torney Charles L. Hardy, came
the noble thirty-eight soldiers of
the National Army, led by Cap
tain Edward L. Mix, accom
panied by an escort of honor
composed of several hundred
citizens carrying flags.
Division number 3, Wirt G.
Bowman, marshal, composed of
public school children, led by
Professor Madden came next,
following by Rev. Van Goethen
and the children of the Parochial
schools, and section number 3,
of the public school children, of
which T. J. Wylie was marshal.
More than one thousand school
children were in the parade
which was cheered all along the
line of march by patriotic citi
zens. With cheering waving of flags
and the band playing stirring
martial music, good byes were
said and the noble thirty-eight
boys from Santa Cruz county,
climbed on board the special
Pullman,, which thanks to kind
generous relatives and friends,
had been supplied with eats and
everything, for the trip.
As the train carrying our boys
to the front, pulled out, taking
and leaving some sad hearts,
whistles blew and bells rang out
"farewell" to the boys who have
answered their country's call.
God be with you, boys, till
we meet again.

Reception to Soldiers Big Success.
The big reception and dance
given last Tuesday night at the
Santa Cruz Club in honor of the
second contingent of men of the
National Army, from this coun
ty, was a big success.
Mr. Wirt G. Bowman, Dr. A.
L. Gustetter and J. B. Bristol,
the committee on reception and
dance, have the thanks of the
county.
To the ladies, God bless 'em,
great credit too is due. They vied
with one another in making "our
boys" happy, and saw to it that
all danced. Pretty girls of the
Red Cross were present in large
numbers to honor Santa Cruz
county's fighting men, all of
whom will ever pleasantly re
member the night before they
went to the Great War.
The citizens and military of
Nogales joined in entertaining
the boys as they were never
entertained before.
Colonel Frier, commander of
the forces in this district, ac
companied by Mrs. Frier and
many officers and their ladies
assisted hundreds of citizens
from Nogales and outlying dis
tricts, in making the reception
and dance a success.
Excellent music was furnished
during the night by the 35th
Infantry band and the Nogales
Orchestra.
Colonel Allen T. Bird, vice
president of the Chamber of
Commerce, acted as chairman of
the evening, the speakers being
Rev. Father Van Goethen, Hon.
E. R. Purdum, Collector of U.
S. Customs C. E. Hardy and
Hon. Frank J. Barry. The
address of the evening was de
livered by Mr. Barry, who is one
of the best speakers in Arizona.
He was at his best and his talk
to the "boys," will be remember
ed by them as long as they live.
It was the best address ever made
here by Mr. Barry, who many
times has delighted Nogales
audiances.
Collector Hardy made a strong
plea to the "stay-at homes," and
asked everybody to get behind
the boys at the front who do the
fighting.
After the reception the young
people danced until a late hour.

by the United States.
Never in the history of Noga
les has an official of Mexico been
accorded the high honor by the
United States government,- as
was shown General Alvaro Obre

Mexico, last Thursday when
General Obregon crossed the in
ternational boundary en route to
Washington and other points of
interest in the United States.

PROCLAMATION BY THE MAYOR
Whereas, "the combat thick
ens," and the world war is on in
earnest, and
Whereas, the second incre
ment of our boys, in answer to
the call to defend the flag, the
Constitution and their country,
and to uphold the democracy
and civilization of nations, in
cludincr an atryreiration of mat
ters and things for the better'
federation of the world on land
and sea, and
Whereas, our home boys leave
on the 19th day of September,
1917, (next Wednesday) to take
part in this war.
Now therefore, on the said
19th day of September, next en
suing, I earnestly recommend
that all stores and places of
business be closed from 1 o'clock
p. m. on said day until the train
departs, and all citizens are most
cordially invited to join the par
ade, in honor of the departure
of our boys. The parade will
form at City Hall and march
around S. P. depot on Interna
tional street, to Morley avenue,
thence to Court street across to
Grand avenue, and back to City
Hall.
It is ordered, that all auto
mobiles and vehicles of every
kind be kept off the streets on
line of march, and will neither
be allowed to move or park on
same during time of parade.
To the young men who go, I
would say go as American sol
diers in defence of your flag and
country with an abhorrence of
all that is cruel or vile, and un
der orders of your officers with
your minds on Heaven and the
Flag.say as Wayne at the storm
ing of Stoney Point, "we will
conquer or we will die." We know
you will make a record, Arizona
will be proud of, and on your
return to Nogales, Santa Cruz
county will greet you, as becom
ing to those who have conquer
ed in the greatest war the world
has had. x-

ESSES
Life
Was a
Misery
Mrs. F. M. Jones, of
Palmer, Okla., writes:
"From the time 1 en
tered into womanhood
... I looked with dread
from one month to the
next. I suffered with my
back and bearing-down
pain, until lite to me was
a misery. I would think
1 could not endure the
pain any longer, and I
gradually got worse. . .
Nothing seemed to help
me until, one day, . . .
I decided to
The Woman's Tonic
"I took four bottles,"
Mrs. Jones goes on to
say, "and was not cnly
greatly relieved, but can
truthfully say that I have
not a pain. . .
It has now been two
years since I took Cardui,
and I am still in good
health. . . I would ad
vise any woman or girl
to use Cardui who is a
sufferer from any female
trouble."
If you suffer pain caused
from womanly trouble, cr
if you feel the need of a
good strengthening tonic
to build up y ourrun-down
system, take the advice
of Mrs. Jones. Try Car
dui. It helped her. We
believe it wHl help you.
