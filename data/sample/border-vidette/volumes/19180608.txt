Both the idle rich and the idle
poor should be put to work.
This country is fighting to pro
tect the liberty and property
rights of all and is the duty of
every citizen to either fight or
help produce something useful.
Mis-5 Winifred Coombs, who
left the district a few weeks ago
to enter the service of the gov
ernment across the seas, lias j
arrived in Lundou on her way to
France, according to advices re- J
ceived here in a letter yester
day. She stated that she had a
nice trip over and that she ex
pected soon to be on her way
across the channel. She stated
that she was not allowed to give
any information as to just what
her movements would be. Miss
Coombs gave up a remunerative
position to do her bit for the
cause of the government. Re
view. Word from Phoenix is to the
effect that progress is being
made in outlining plans for the
Globe- Miami Seperior- Phoenix
road. Last week a delegation
from Miami visited the commis
sion on state institutions and
urged that the road be built and
made the main highway of travel
between Miami and Phoenix. If
built the road will be 35 miles
shorter than the present route
by way of Roosevelt lake, and
only fourteen miles longer than
the direct air route. Grades on
this proposed route will be re
duced to a minimum. Copper
Camp.
Word from Florence is to the
effect that the Powers brothers
and Tom Sissons are becoming
acclimated to the Florence pen-
tentiary. It will be recalled by
the readers of the Copper Camp
that the trio were found guilty
of the murder of Sheriff McBride
of Graham county and two of
his deputies. They are under
sentence of life imprisonment.
It is said they are now working
in the prison laundry. Tom
Sissons, it is said, formerly serv
ed a sentence for horse stealing.
Their crime has all Graham
county calling out for an oppor
tunity to vote in favor of rein
stating capital punishment.
BANKS AND NEWSPAPERS.
There are two classes of busi
ness men who give their time
and equipment unstintingly to
the government without hope of
financial return bankers and
newspapermen.
During a Liberty Loan Drive
every bank and every news
paper turns its entire equipment
over to the service of the gov
ernment without money and
without price.
The newspapers furnish the
publicity without which no bond
issue of such magnitude could
be floated in such short time and
the banks furnish the skilled
help and machinery for hand
ling the millions of subscrip
tions, keeping books on defer
red pay ments, carrying accounts,
etc., and later issuing the bonds.
The bankers and newspapers
deserve great credit, for no
other line of industry gives its
services absolutely free of
charge. The Manufacturer.
Mining Shares Under New Law.
A Phoenix dispatch states that
the Arizona Corporation Com
mission, by resolution, has de
cided that no further permits
for the issuing of stock, certifi
cates or bonds will be granted
by that commission unless the
company secures the approval
of the capital issues committee,
the creation of which was au
thorized by recent act of the U.
S. congress. This committee,
as announced by the govern
ment will examine all requests
for permission to issue stock,
certificates or bonds and that
none will be permitted unless
such issues are beneficial to the
government during the war. It
is stated that the act is not re
troactive, but that all stock per
mits expire in June will have to
run the gauntlet of this new
committee before being renewed.
THE RATE ADVANCE.
Recommendation that all rail
road rates be increased at lsast
25 per cent is a belated recogni
tion of a necessity which has
existed for several years.
Under Government operation
it is proposed to do at one stroke
that which the Interstate Com
merce Commission had persis
tently refused to permit under
private operation. Acting ac
cording to the plain facts ot the
situatioa instead of being sway
ed by prejudice, Director-Gen
eral McAdoo is not likely to
delay long his acceptance of the
advice given by the men to
whom all Government author
ities were formerly deaf.
Though much has been said
about the inefficiency of railroad
management, it has been sur
passed by the inefficiency of
Government regulation of the
railroads. If regulation had been
efficient, it would have recogniz
ed that poor service is dear at
any price, that revenue adequate
to maintain, improve and extend
the lines is essential to good
service, and that any attempt to
punish owners of railroads by
denying them such revenue falls
ultimately on the shippers and
through them on the people in
general.
The men who made and ad
ministered railroad laws were
prevented by the clamor of de
magogues and railroad baiters
from following the guidance of
their own judgment. Because
one railroad had been mis man
aged, they punished also the
ninety nine which had been well
managed, and their patrons with
them. Because traffic had been
pooled to the injury of the pub
lic, they refused to permit pool
ing so directed by public regula
tion that it would have inured to
the public good. Portland Ore
gonian.
..In swatting the railroads in
this manner we failed to realize
we were swatting not only our
selves but the whole nation.
We are now face to face with
th3 same condition in our public
utilities street railway, water,
light, gas and telephone. The
hypocrite crys, "grant no in
crease in rates" etc.
Will we refuse to see the mer
its of the case until these public
utilities break down and find our
whole industrial system crip
plod as were the railroads, by
this almost criminal negligence
on the part of our regulating
bodies.
Surely one lesson well learned
is enough, let us profit by it.

HE SUBSCRIBED.
In an eastern farming com
munity a wealthy German farm
er refused to buy Liberty Bonds
said he did not consider it a
good investment and he did not
want to supply money with
which to buy ammunition that
might kill his relatives. Inves
tigation found that this man had
landed in the states with 80.00
and that he had fled from Prus
sia to avoid the military draft.
He acquired a section of fine
land and had a bank deposit of
20,0C0. The sheriff of the coun
ty was made a committee of one
to visit the farmer, to hand him
the sum of 80.00 and to tell
him that his place was not in
that community that the kaiser
needed him and that he should
go across the sea. The point
was appreciated. The farmer
subscribed at once to a 5,000
bond .
The Hosey mine has been
taken over on a bond and lease
by middle west capitalists. Mr.
A. R. Grund, a St. Louis attor
ney, who has had considerable
experience in mining, is the ex
ecutive head of the company,
and will move his family here
soon. Work on the property
will begin immediately. The
men interested in the Hosey
(now called the Pinal) are also
considering the purchase of
other nearby mines, and will in
vest considerable capital in their
enterprises here. Patagonian.
NO WHEAT UNTIL SEPTEMBER.
Many church organizations
throughout the United States
have adopted the no wheat diet
until September 1 and fraternal
orders are likewise signing the
following resolution:
Whereas, There is an insuffi
cient amount of wheat and wheat
products within this countiy to
satisfy all demands; and
Whereas, There is a large per
centage of cur inhabitants lead
ing sendentary lives, and who
could, by foregoing their quota,
substantially increase the sup
ply to the allies, our soldiers
and manual laborers, who have
first call on such wheat and
wheat products; and
Whereas, Arizona is contribut
ing directly to France 3,000,000
pounds of Hour, which would
formerly have been consumed
by our own people; which flour
is being manufactured from Ari
zona wheat marketed by Arizona
farmers under the call issued
by the food administrator for
Arizona;
Now, Therefore, Be it Resolv
ed, That the members of this
body who are not engaged in
heavy manual labor shall refrain
from eating any wheat oi wheat
products until September 1 next; j
and
Be it Further Resolved, That
this sacrifice is made freely and
voluntarily and with an earnest
appreciation of the difficulties
the leaders of our nation en
counter in arranging an equit
able distribution of our flour and
other wheat prod ucts, which dis
tribution takes into considera
tion the extraordinary physical
requirements of certain classes
of workers.
Patriots Will Forget Politics.
Words that have been written
or spoken can not be recalled,
hence great care should be ex
ercised while considering war
measures, that none are offend
ed. People do not all see or
think alike but each may be
equally honest. Calling a man
an I. W. W. or an A. P. A. just
because the theory of attaining
the end sought is different from
ours, shows one is short of real
argument. It is both childish
and dangerous. Every man
guards his loyalty as sacredly as
does a woman her virtue. The
torn tits and chipmunks that eat
crumbs from the profiteers tables
should be taught civility and
decency, at any cost. All Am
ericans are loyal and honest ex
cept those who doubt their fel
low man, evidently judging him
by their own inner feelings.
Any man who will make trouble
now to gain partisan advantage
or to injure the character of an
other, whether a public official
or private citizen, is a traitor to
his country, a lit companion for
those who preach German kultur
or practice sabotage. There is
little difference between the
vandal that destroys property
and the human vulture who at
tacks character by unfair me
thods. Property destroyed can
be replaced but character once
besmirched, can not be fully re
stored. Messenger.

GREAT FUTURE FOR MINING.
One thing among many others
that the war has done is to give
the east a better understanding
as to the needs and value of the
mines of the west.
When the war came on, and
with it a tremendous demand for
metals, the mines at once as
sumed an importance they had
never before held. To enable
the nation to win the war, the
mines had to produce a liberal
output under most adverse con
ditions; and this they accom
plished to an extent beyond criti
cism. Many old mines and numerous
prospects are held idle at pre
sent time, the owners only await
ing advent of more propitious
times to start development op
erations. Present governing
facts can only mean that when
better national conditions ma
terialize there will be a record
revival in mining, more substan
tial than a boom, and of con
tinued duration, says Mining and
Financial Record.
All the mining industry needs
is encouragement in the way of
fair legislation and taxation and
if prices must be regulated let
them be high enough to assure
good returns to the men risking
their capital in development and
good wages to the workmen.
In a statement to senate mines
committee on ore control bill,
C. F. Kelly of the Anaconda
company said the bill would es
tablish control over entire min
eral industry of country..
Such measures are not neces
sary under present government
regulation and would discourage
rather than encourage produc
tion, a fatal mistake at this time.
W. S. S. GOOD INVESTMENT.
In asking the people to invest
in War Savings and Thrift
Stamps, the government is not
asking them to contribute money.
It is merely asking for the use
of the money and is willing to
pay liberally for it.
The government simply wishes
to employ your money and pay
you for its service, just as it
would employ you and pay you
for your services.
You will get your money back
with interest compound interest
at the rate of 4 per cent per an
num. The stamps mature in five
years but you can cash them at
any time you wish before the
date of maturity and get interest
at 3 per cent.
If you need the service of
your money before five years,
the Savings Stamps handed to
the postmaster will be the letter
of resignation and you will get
your money back, with addition
al payment for the time you per
mitted the government to use it.
There is no red tape, no both
er, no uncertainty, no work. It
is the simplest, safest and most
satisfactory investment you can
make.

HAT'S IN THE RING.
Judge M . Marsteller Is a Candidate for
Judge of the Superior Court.
TO THK VOTERS OF SANTA CRCZ
COUNTY.
Ladies and Gentlemen:
The office of Judge of the Su
perior Court is h. very important
office, and you will be required
to vote for an incumbent at the
November election. I hereby
announce myself a candid.ate for
the same. In this announcement
I desire to say that the man
elevated to tnis position may be
required to pass upon the liber
ties and property rights of you
and your fellow man. The Judge
is not bound in any penal sum
of gold, for the performance of
duty, he is bound by something
greater, stronger, by something
grander and brighter, he is
bound alone by the oath and
honor of man. In California at
one time it was proposed to take
the election of Judges out of
politics, by holding separate
Judicial elections, but this prov
ed expensive, and the people
failed to turn out, and I rather
believe that they adopted a law
from which the Arizona Statute
has been drafted. By the Ari
zona procedure, it is sought to
take the office out of party or
partisan politics, by placing the
names of the candidates for
Judges at the head of the ballot
in a single column in alphabet
ical order witnout partisan or
other designation except the
title of the office. Immediately
below the names of the candi
dates for Judges there shall be
placed in columns the names of
candidates for other offices of
the several political parties. By
this provision of the Code, the
office of the Judge was intended
and expected to be taken out of
politics. President Wilson in
addressing the New Jersey de
mocrats lately, said "the old
party slogans have lost their
significance and will mean noth
ing to the voter of the future,
and henceforth all true Amer
icans taking democratic prin
ciples to their hearts will re
quire a stricter ana truer com
pliance with the laws of their
country from now on.
During this gigantic tragedy
of a world at war, self interest
should be only and by far a sec
ondary consideration, and all
should yield only to true Amer
icanism. The chief individual
question now is whether a man
will do or whether he will shirk,
and every man must decide this
question for himself, no matter
what the other fellow does, he
should examine his own con
science and see what he is doing
himself, and every true Amer
ican will decide the matter about
right. War changes the minds
and thoughts of nations as well
as the minds of men.
A new order of things is being
born, new services will be re
quired and had, new sacrifices
must be continually made until
victory comes, and in the recon
struction and arrangement of
the world's affairs, where Amer
icans, regardless of party lines,
have stood side by side, against
the death dealing charges of the
enemy hordes, giving their blood
and lives in holding the lines,
checking the black powers of
darkness, fighting for the break
of morning, fighting for the free
dom of the world, over tyranny
and unheard of cruel butcheries
of innocent women and children,
over graft and over greed, and
when the boys who survive the
terrible ordeal, return home,
their question will not be to
those who staid behind, what
party do you belong to, nor
what did you do for yourself or
party, but will rather be, what
did you do for the United States
in her time of need and strain,
from foes without and from foes
within? Did you render the
proper American aid according to
your means? This war is being
waged for the safety and freedom
of nations and mankind, true
freedom can only be based and
flourish on truth and justice, and
this freedom will come with vic
tory. This war means more than
the bare conquering of Ger
many. No hand should be rais
ed nor a dollar spent without
this purpose in view, and this is
the first and main thing to be
accomplished. There are no pol
itics to it. it is purely a question
of straight Americanism which
includes the highest grade of
self sacrificing patriotism.
When this war is over, and
freedom's royal day arrives,
which will come as sure as the
air is the channel of light, under
the new improvement of things,
the Constitution of the United
States, the best fabric of gov
ernment that was ever made
will be more venei ated, and even
the courts will not attempt to
hold back or break what has
been forged and Avelded in the
crucible of war. And the Am
erican flag will have that full
love and devotional respect at
home and abroad, which it is
entitled to. I have had some
experience on the bench, I be
lieve in holding court, in the
open, on time and under the law.
In the event that you may see
lit to elevate me to the position
of Judge, I shall fully appre
ciate the great responsibility
that you would confer, and I can
promise no more, than I will
give real sincere effort and tire
less unceasing devotion to the
ascertainment of the law which
shall be applied and govern in
merited and deserving claims of
justice, and the Superior Court
for the County of Santa Cruz,
shall stand as high as any in the
world, to the extent of its juris
diction. Voters of Santa Cruz, my
cause is in your hands, till the
election closes on November 5th
next.
May God rule the earth that
He created, and may the Govern
ment at Washington, with a fully
united America forever reign.
M. Marsteller.

The Spirit of Friendship.
This store looks upon its patrons not
merely as customers but as friends.
People purchase here because they
have friendly feeling for this store.
The cause which develops this friendly
feeling, may differ, in fact, they are
sure to differ. One's friendship for
the store is the result of finding good
values; another's is the result of effi
cient service and courteous treatment,
and so on.
Naturally this friendshiply feeling on
the part of our patrons is reciprocated
on our part. And this spirit of mutual
friendship is an impetus for greater
service and an incentive to ever-increasing
endeavor to make this store
a place where every visitor will feel
perfectly at home.
