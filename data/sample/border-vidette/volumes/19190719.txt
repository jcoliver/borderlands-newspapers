AMERICA' PART IN THE WAR.
Powerful Argument tor the Proposed
League of Nations.
America's part in winning the
world war is graphically told in
a "Statistical Summary of the
War With Germany," just from
the press and written by Col.
Leonard P. Ayres, Chief of the
Statistics Branch of the General
Staff. The summary is a print
ed document of 150 pages and is
a complete statistical review of
America's participation in the
greatest war in history. It is
regarded as a powerful argu
ment for the League of Nations
as a deterrent of future conflicts.
The war's cost to America was
$21,850,000,000, or approximate
ly $1,000,000 an hour. Of the
total, $13,030,000,000 went for
army expenses.
The country's total armed
force when the armistice was
signed was 4,800,000 mem of
whom four million were in the
army, the remainder being in
the navy. Marine Corps and
other branches.
The number of men sent over
seas was 2,080,000, of whom 1,
390,000 were actually engaged
at the front. The number of
Americans engaged in the Me
use Artjonne battle, the greatest
operation in which American
troops participated, was 1,200,
000. American casualities in
this engagement number 120,000
officers aud men. Battle deaths
approximated 50,000, wounded
235,000, and deaths from disease
56,991 up to April 30, 1919.
Some notable achievements
were accomplished by those
charged with the duty of waging
the war. Not the least of these
was the fact that, despite the U
boat peril, 306,000 men were
transported overseas in one
month. The speed with which
the army' is being returned Is in
dicated by the fact that 333,000
were brought home in one
month.
Supplies shipped from the
United States to Prance amount
ed to 7,500,000 tons in the nine
teen months of this country's
uaiticipation in the war.
The number of men registered
for military service under the
Selective Service Act was 24,
234,021, of whom 2,810,206 were
inducted into the service. The
largest number inducted in any
month was 400,000.
While the British sent more
men to Prance during the first
year of their participation in
the war than the United States
did, it took them three years to
attain a strength of two million
men in Prance, while the United
States accomplished this in one
half that time.
Approximately 200,000 com
missioned officers were required
for the army, the report shows,
and of these, less than 9,000
were in the Pederal service at
the war's outbreak. Of these,
5791 were regulars and the re
mainder National Guard officers.
The remainder had to come
from civil iife, and most of them
were trained at the Officers'
Training Camps. Of every six
officers in the army, one had
had previous training in the
regular army, National Guard
or in the ranks; three received
their training at the Officers'
Training Camps, and the other
two came direct from civil life
with little or no military train
ing. The average soldier who went
to Prance had six months of
training at home and two months
of intense training after arriv
ing in France.
ARIZONA'S MINERAL WEALTH.
The valuation of all property
assessed to producing mining
companies for the year 1919, is
approximately seven million dol
lars more than last year, as
shown by a statement made by
the state tax commission.
The total valuation of all
property for 1919, is $483,191,-
526.44. The mines in Cochise
county are assessed for $110,
259.179. The assessment in Santa Cruz
county of the Duquesne Mining
& Reduction Co., is $236,(51 8.
Pinal county mines have a total
valuation of $13,752,170, Gila
$119,65 1,096, Yavapai $81535,353
THE PRESIDENT'S TOUR.
For several months the Presi
dent's opponents have had a
sort of "open season" of criti
cism of him and his policies and
proposals. While he was busy
in the solution of the world's
biggest problem, a large num
ber of his fellow countrymen
were engaged in the easiest of
all tasks finding fault. So mean
and petty and spiteful has been
some of this carping that one
can hardly escape believing its
authors would have found as
much satisfaction in his failure
(if he-had failed) as other more
patriotic Americans have deriv
ed from his success.
But a few weeks hence the
President is to tour the country
and meet friends and foes face
to face and give the American
people an account of his stew
ardship. He will at the same
time doubtless afford them some
understanding of the tremend
ous difficulties that confronted
him in the Peace conference and
submit to them the greatest of
all modern achievements in
statesmanship the League of
Nations.
Those who have misunder
stood, those who have judged
hastily and those who have been
misled, will have the truth from
the President's lips, and will be
convinced. Only the partisan
and the narrow traditionalist,
may be expected to remain proof
against facts and reason. The
Graham Guardian.
LETTER FROM SIBERIA.
Fred Valenzuela this week re
ceived a letter from his brother,
Carlos, written in Vladivestok,
Siberia, not long ago, says the
Santa Cruz Patagonian.
Carlos is still "marooned"
with 'ahe American army in Si
beria, and the letter does not
say when he expects to be home.
The following poetry was
enclosed, which seems to
press the sentiments of
ex
the homesick soldier boys:
Darling I am coming back;
Silver threads among the black.
Now that peace in Europe nears,
I'll be home in seven years.
I'll drop in on you some night
With my whiskers long and white
Yes, the war is over, dears,
And I'll be back in seven years.
Home again with you once more,
Say by nineteen twenty-four.
Once I thought by now I'd be
Sailing back across the sea;
Back to Frisco's Golden Gate,
Leaving Russia to her fate.
Now you hear the boys curse;
War is h but peace is worse.
When the next war comes around
In the front ranks I'll be found.
I'll rush right in pell-meli
Yes I will, like h ; like h .
ARIZONA MOVES FORWARD.
Arizona has developed the last
few years by leaps and bounds.
Agricultural development has
expanded enormously. Thous
ands of acres of desert are con
stantly being made green with
prosperous farms. The vast un
touched mineral resources of the
state are gradually being de
veloped and more of the profits
are being left in Arizona instead
of being shipped to the east and
to foreign countries. New banks
are constantly being established
and the capital is coming to be
owned more and. more by Ariz
onans, whose interests are here.
Strong business institutions are
developing in our midst.
Thousands of homes are being
built and owned by the people.
This baby state is beginning to
sense its strength and maturity.
It is now facing the greatest era
of its development. With its in
comparable possibilities and op
portunities it offers golden fruit
to the homeseeker. Post.
The state of Arizona is allott
ed $10, 176, 794. 35, approximately,
under the Federal Aid Act. to be
used in constructing, recon
structing and maintaining of
roads, streets and bridges. To
secure this amount, the states,
counties and municipalities must
allot an equal amount for the
above purposes.

PRESIDENT OF ARIZONA LEGION
Andrew P. Martin, of Tucson,
was elected state commander of
the Arizona branch of the Amer
ican Legion at its organization
convention there without oppo
sition. D. A. Little, of Florence, was
chosen temporary secretary and
the selection of a permanent
was left to the state executive
committee. It is intended to
make the office a salaried posi
tion and state headquarters yet
to be selected.
Commander Martin is a well
known Tucson druggist. He
was top sergeant, battery B,
340th Field Artillery, seeing ser
vice in the Argonne and later
with the army of occupation in
Germany.
Will Educate Disabled Soldiers.
A training center for disabled
soldiers will be established at
the University of Arizona, the
federal board for vocational edu
cation has announced.
Students will be admitted to
all the regular courses in the
university, and even special
courses will be inaugurated for
veterans who desire them.
The government pays all the
expenses of disabled soldiers
taking the courses, aud in addi
tion pays a monthly allowance
up to $60 to each veteran. It is
expected that many soldiers who
were gassed in Europe will at
tend the university because of
the climate in Arizona.

ARIZONA'S BLIND BABIES.
Ever since 1912 when Mr.
"Whipple, member of the House
of Representatives introduced a
bill urged by the International
Sunshine Society, to provide for
the blind of the state from the
day of blindness these little folks
are eligible to state care.
But few mothers of the blind
know this fact. The bill became
a law, being one of the first bills
the Hon. George W. P. Hunt
then governor, signed.
Several little babies have been
sent to the Arthur Home, Nur
sery, School and Hospital com
bined.for blind babies and back
ward blind children, located at
Summit, N. J., up in the pines.
There are two little babies there
now from Arizona, and the year's
report that has just reached the
capital makes this news most
timely. '
Baby John D., as he is called,
who bails from Humboldt has
learned to sit up and take notice
of things for be is beginning to
get some sight.
Baby Mary, nicknamed "Ariz
ona," a waif of Phoenix, is learn
ing to walk. She will always
be blind , the experts say, .but
she is very bright mentally.
Isn't Arizona ' slow in report
ing its blind babies when such a
law stands and the state is will
ing to provide exceptional care
for them, sending the child to
school with a nurse and only
two babies now taking advant
age of this training?
Report all blind babies you
know of to the Board of Direct
ors of State Institutions, Phoe
nix, Arizona, and write Mrs.
John Alden, 96 Fifth avenue,
New York City, the founder of
the Sunshine Homes for Blind
Babies and to whom the state is
sending its biind little ones for
care.
Second Federal Judge Certain.
Mark Smith's bill creating an
additional judge for the district
of Arizona passed the senate on
July 1. The bill passed the sen
ate in a previous congress, but
was killed in the house. It was
put on the unanimous consent
calendar by Congressman Hay
den and every time it was
brought up a member from Mas
sachusetts and another from
Wisconsin objected, sd that it
died when congress adjourned.
It was reintroduced by Senator
Smith when congress met in
May and is known as senate bill
No. 282. It was reported to the
senate without amendment and
passed. The bill is as follows:
"Be it enacted, etc., That the
president of the United States
shall appoint by and with the
advice and consent of the senate,
an additional judge for the dis
trict of Arizona, who shall reside
in said district and shall possess
the same qualifications and have
the same powers and jurisdic
tions and receive the same sal
ary now prescribed by law in
respect of the present district
judge therein.
Sec. 2. That the clerk of the
district court for the district of
Arizona and the marshal and
district attorney for said district
shall perform the duties apper
taining to their offices, respect
ively, for said court."
