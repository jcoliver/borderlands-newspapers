The Spirit of Friendship.
This store looks upon its patrons not
merely as customers but as friends.
People purchase here because they
have friendly feeling for this store.
The cause which develops this friendly
feeling, may differ, in fact, they are
sure to differ. One's friendship for
the store is the result of finding good
values; another's is the result of effi
cient service and courteous treatment,
and so on.
Naturally this frieudshiply feeling on
the part of our patrons is reciprocated
on our part. And this spirit of mutual
friendship is an impetus for greater
service and an incentive to ever-increasing
endeavor to make this store
a place where every visitor will feel
perfectly at home.

PATAGONIA MINING NEWS.
The Hardshell has recently
encountered some good silver-
lead ore.
The Hosey is now breaking
ore with machine drills. The
compressor was put in place and
started this week.
The Flux Company ha3 been
shipping concentrates this month
The company is making repairs,
but has not shut down the mill,
as was reported last week.
Tom Stafford has canceled his
contract with the lessees of the
Morning Glory mine and has
severed his connection with the
prooerty. He has been superin
tending the development work.
The lead ore taken from the
Dixie during development work
some time ago was loaded on the
car Wednesday for shipment to
the smelter. Work was indefi
nitely suspended there several
months ago, but may be resum
ed, it is reported.
The Pierce Gardner lease is
looking even better than report
ed or anticipated by the lessees,
and their shipments are steady
and consistent. It is hoped the
property will be opened up so
more men can be employed to
take out the ore, which is of the
.very highest grade. The lessees
anticipate taking out about two
cars weekly until a better equip
can be installed for handling the
ore at the mine.
The Magma Copper Company
(Gunn-Thompson interests) is
completing arrangements for the
purchase of the 3-R property.
It is stated that the deal invol
ves in the neighborhood of $750,
000. Those familiar with the
operation of, this camp know
what their advent into this dis
tiict will mean. Out of avast
number of properties examined
by them in the last several years
the 3 R is one of the few that
has been accepted, and when
once they have taken over the
property it will receive all the
talent and money any property
can ask for to make of it a real
live producer. If anyone needs
proof that the Patagonia district
is coming into its own, the fact
that the Magma is coming into
the district should be conclusive.

Accused of Using Third Degree.
Charging members of the
Phoenix police force with bar
barous third degree methods in
attempting to elicit confessions
from prisoners, Manuel Ochoa,
on trial for burglary in Judge
Stanford's division of the supe
rior court, told why he confessed
to committing the burglary with
which he is charged when he
took the witness stand this morn
ing, says the Arizona Repub
lican. Ochoa claimed that he was
beaten and pounded by members
of the police force until he con
fessed to the crime to avert fur
ther punishment. This method
was immediately discontinued
after his confession, he said.
The Mexican is charged with
burglarizing the Marsh home in
this city. This is his second
trial, the first resulting in a jury
disagreement.
The office of the Adjutant
General is preparing to close up
the business relating to the se
lective draft and think that the
whole matter may be disposed
of in about a month. It is now
engaged in sending back to the
local boards lists of deserters
and is receiving lists from other
states.
A new type of "road agent
has been developed lately on
the desert roads of western Ari
zona, locally known as "high
jacker." His method is to stop
automobiles bound eastward
from California and search them
for spirituous liquors, which are
"confiiscated" if found. It is
understood that fully half the
eastbound autos have been stop
ed and searched, though nothing
was taken beyond the liquid
cago found.
The Moctezuma Copper Com
pany at Nacozari, Sonora, has
ordered 10,000 minnows from the
United States government, and
will place them in a lake near

arrive within about two weeks
and are supplied to the company
without cost, the hatcheries
bureau to ship them as if Naco
zari was within the United
States.

The work of tta Itd Cross is not

In hospital nor nnihlst he ruins of livl
glum and other portions of devastated
-Europe. One of its groat activities is
any necessary aid lo tli? dependents of
members of America's military forces.
On the battlefield the Red Cross pre
sents an heroic Sevres. In America,
removed from destruction and death,
the Red Cross steps silently to t In
side of the father and mother whose
boy Is "over there" and who need conn
ate! and aid.
No Bervic la too small for the Red
Cros. If allotments from the groverr.
ment or from their uon aro delayed, or
Information on the government's war risk
Insurance is wanted, the Ited Cross is
both counsellor and friend. It enters Into
the noma In tha true spirit of charity
secrecy.
But first and foremost our soldiers In
field and hospital nxust be given the mot
attentive care possible. Nothing we can
do will equal their share in this move
ment for world democracy, and the lied
Cross presents an opportunity for us to
play our part in this great drama by
contributing to the extent of our ability.
The Red Cross appeals to organised
workers because of Itf one uuallty
service.
Behind Red Cross service Ik an en

cost marks, a democracy that personifies
Jefferson's great principle of equality and
a religion that la beyond sectarianism.
MAKE SOLDIER FEEL HE

Men disabled In Use service who are

It hard at first to see their way to

propriated to re-educate every dis

nity to make a living. It Is felt that
such men are likely to be weakened
In their resolution to keep their self
respect and find real work by the mis
taken charity of hero worshippers, who
will forget them once the first flush of
war enthusiasm Is over. Hero the sup
port of the disabled man's family must
be enlisted, for In the last analysis It
Is the man's family who will be the de
termining Influence In ids rehabilita

meet the situation to make of them
selves for the man a bulwark against
discouragement and weakness.

SMILES AND TEARS GET MIXED.
Two little stories came to the Red
Cross headquarters from over the seas
short time ago. One was a sry of
bravery that brought the tears, and
one a tale of tears that brought smiles.
The first story was of a soldier who
asked for a light. He was in bed, and
a cigarette was between his lips, plac
ed there by the nurse after she had
finished spreading his blanket up
smoothly. At his question, she turned
and gave him a box of matches and
hurried on. then remembered that the
arms beneath the blankets were with
out hands.
Nurses have to be without tears, but
'there were tears In her eyes as she
turned to strike the match nnd light
the cigarette for him.
"Quit that," be said, "they were good
mlts, and they helped get three or four
Germans before I lost them, lt they
ain't worth crying about, 60 there!"
And the tears story that brought
smiles? Well, that was the story of a
big, husky, colored man, who sat read
ing,, and the lied Cross worker at the
canteen saw that he had tears running
down his cheeks; She was curious to
know what he might be reading and
was astonished when she looked over
his shoulder to see that It was the
canteen cook hook.
He smiled through his tears as be
saw that she was watching, and said,

of th- day for remaining at their posts

WHAT RED CROSS MEANS.
Tour membership In the great
American Hed Cross means the
mothering of those little children

the Hun. Mrs. I-ars Anderson in

dying, innocent children, who do
not know what It is all about
they wring your heart dry."
