Sitton and Murphy were in
Kingman yesterday from the
Aquarius range, where they have
made discovery of the old Shipp
mine, which is said to have been
lost many years ago. The ore
brought in from the property is
high in lead silver values, and
also carries copper. Kingman
Miner.
Prominent citizens of King
man have sent a party of ex
perts to the northern part of
Mohave county to examine the
oil bearing wound in that local
ity, with a view to securing land
.in the best part of the field. It
is the opinion of many oil men
that a big, productive field will
be opened up.
Weather records show that
this is the longest spell of dry
weather in the winter time for
many years. In the winter of
1905 the first storm of the winter
of 1905 and 1906 came the day
after Christmas, the Xmas of
that year being a warm one
like this year. Will it snow or
rain this year is the burning
question that is on every one's
tongue now. Tombstone Pros
pector. Tom Sickles this week brought
in from the Wallapai mountains
samples of ore that gave results
of better than 200 ounces in sil
ver to the ton. This ore comes
from a new find in the neighbor
hood of Moss Wash, about 20
miles southeast of Kingman.
Mr. Sickles believes he has an
excellent prospect for a stake in
this property and intends to
operate it with a small force.
The find is in the neighborhood
of the rich silver bearing coun
try in which is situated the old
Hibernia. Kingman Miner.
Many eastern promoters and
stock brokers of doubtful char
acter, together with some re
liable interests, are preparing
for silver mining activities. It
is indicated that the next few
months will see the country
flooded with wildcat silver
stocks, along with which there
will be a demand for legitimate
silver prospects. Owners of the
latter should be very careful in
making associations. Inquiries
of reputable New York and Bos
ton banks or brokers of good
standing on the New York Stock
Exchange should be made as to
the reputations of those propos
ing to take over properties of
fering investments. Graham
Guardian.
HIGH PRICES UNTIL. 1920.
"When Will the Price Break
Come?" was discussed before
100 members of the New York
Advertising club by Prof. Ed
win R. A. Seligman, of Colum
bia, and Theodore E. Burton,
bank president. Prof. Seligman
pointed out that prices and pros
perity in this country went up
and down in cycles, and that we
were now in what would have
been, even without the war, a
period rising prices.
Cyclical depressions will never
be so great in the future as in
the past, former Senator Burton
said, because better business
methods, greater knowledge and
far-sighted laws enable us to
cope with such situations. Every
twenty-three or twenty-four
years, however, prices in the
United States seem to change
for better or worse. High prices
should take a downward turn in
1920, he said.
GRAND JURY REPORT.
To the Honorable W. A. O'
Connor, Judge of the Superior
Court of the State of Arizona, in
and for the County of Santa
Cruz:
We, the Grand Jury, duly em
panelled and sworn on the 11th
day of December, A. D., 1917, as
a grand jury of the Superior
Court of the State of Arizona,
in and for the County of Santa
Cruz, bag to report as follows:
We have inquired into three
cases of murder, and five cases
of grand larceny, one of assault
with intent to commit murder
and one for bootlegging, and
herewith present to you the fol
lowing true bills and indict
ments, to-wit, two for murder,
five for grand larceny, one for
assault with intent to commit
murder, and one for bootleg
ging.
We hare made a thorough in
vestigation into the murder of
Fred. J. Miller at Mowry, Santa
Cruz County, Arizona, on the
12th day of October, 1917, but
from, the evidence produced be
fore us we were unable to re
turn any indictments charging
anyone with the murder of the
said Fred. J. Miller.
In view of the fact that itis
the duty of the State Examiner,
who is an expert accountant, to
examine the accounts of the sev
eral county offices, the Grand
Jury have deemed it unneces
sary to examine the accounts of
the various county offices, as the
State Examiner will in due time
make a thorough investigation
of the accounts of the several
county offices, and will, at that
time, make a report of tne result
of his investigations to the
Board of Supervisors.
Investigation shows that a
number of defendants have gone
without trial on account of a
trial jury not being called in
time to try these defendants
within the time specified by the
statute of limitations. We re
spectfully suggested that a me
thod be adopted, or the system
improved, so as to avoid a re
currence of this situation in the
future, and to that end we re
spectfully recommend that the
Court adopt the same system
that is now in effect in Pima
county, viz, that a trial jury be
summoned in the month of Jan
uary of each year. to serve foi
the entire year, being excused
from time to time to be called
again within a time not to ex
ceed ninety days. In this man
ner no defendant will escape for
want of a trial jury within the
time specified by the statute of
limitations.
We have investigated condi
tions relating to the practice of
prostitution within Nogales and
the county in general, and from
our investigation we find that
there is a considerable amount
of prostitution beipg practiced,
but the laws of the State, are
inadequate to handle the situa
tion, and for that reason we
have had no remedy to apply,
nor any laws upon which we
could base any indictments.
Investigations show that there
is also a considerable amount of
bootlegging being carried on in
Nogales and in the county in
general. We subpoenaed num
erous witnesses before us to
testify concerning alleged viola
tions of the prohibition laws,
but none of them were able to
give us any definite information
along these lines, and because
of our inability to secure proper
and satisfactory evidence we
have been unable to return any
indictments charging any one
with violation of the prohibition
laws, save and except one de
fendant. We believe that the Sheriff's
office is greatly handicapped and
crippled in the enforcement of
the laws, and in the apprehen
sion of criminals, because of an
insufficient number of deputies
and jailers, and to this end we
strongly recommend to and urge
upon the Board of Supervisors
that they re-establish the posi
tions of two County Rangers;
that a deputy sheriff be appoint
ed for and stationed at both Pa
tagonia and Duquesne, and par
ticularly at Patagonia, as the
people in the county are entitled
to just as much police protection
as are the people in Nogales,
and that an additional deputy be
appointed for duty in Nogales.
We also strongly recommend
and urge that the Board of Sup
ervisors increase the salaries of
all jailors to the sum of $125. (X)
per month; that all deputy
sheriffs be paid at least 125.00
per month, and that the under
sheriff be paid $140.00 per
month, the present schedule of
salaries being paid to the jailors
and deputy sheriffs being in
adequate to supply the average
man with the necessary cost of
living.
We further recommend that
a new county jail be erected, the
present jail having outgrown its
usefulness, and that until such
time as a new jail can be erected
that the present jail be repaired
and put, in a more sanitary con
dition, and that the county phy
sician be required to inspect the
county jail at least twice a week.
We also recommend that iron
bars or steel netting be placed
across the jail yard so chat it
will be possible for inmates of
the county jail to have access to
the jail yard during daytime.
We have in vestigated all coun
ty offices, and from our investi
gation we find that all of them
are being run efficiently , and
economically.
Thorough investigation of
road construction shows that the
system of handling this work by
day labor is very inefficient, and
that proper check has not been
made covering the keeping of
the time or the services ren
dered. We recommend that in the
future in the maintenance of
county roads that a system be
adopted that will prevent like
leaks, and that the taxpayers be
given full value for their money.
Respectfully submitted,
Geo. J. White, Foreman.
THE BEST WAY TO NOGALES
There is an excellent road
from Fort.Huachuca to Nogales
and there will soon be a good
road over the Charleston bridge
to Fort Huachuca and already
there is inquiry as to when it
will be available so that people
from the Fort and Nogales can
get onto the state highway at
Tombstone. It is imperatiye
that the Board of Supervisors
and County Engineer see that
this road is opened from the
Charleston bridge to the road
near Buena or Overton by the
shortest line. It is but natural
that the Nogales Fort Huachuca
people are anxious to get onto
the state highway that connects
Tombstone with Bisbee and
Douglas. People naturally want
to get onto the good roads, the
sooner the better and, as Engi
neer Ryan states, the Bisbee
Tombstone highway to the nar
rows will be thrown open soon,
it is but right, just and business,
that the road from Charleston to
Overton or the close place be
cut out at once on completion of
the road to the bridge from this
end which is now about accom
plished. Tombstone Prospector
AMERICAN BULLETS HIT HARD
The German soldier's armor
will not withstand the hard hit
ting American bullet, it has
been shown. A heavy breast
plate removed from a German
prisoner for a test was literally
chewed to pieces by machine
gun fire after a rifle bullet fired
at a good range had torn a hole
in the armor as big as a silver
dollar. Even the bullets from
an automatic pistol did the work.
We Helped Take Jerusalem.
Major General F. B. Maurice,
chief director of military opera
tion of the English war office, in
a statement regarding the capt
ure of Jerusalem, says the troops
who fought at Gaza drank water
from Egypt, pumped thru an
American pipe line, and were
supplied over a broad gauge
railroad laid clear across the 150
miles of the desert, which has
defeated almost everybody that
tried to conquer Egypt for cen
turies. Every ounce of material
for the pipe line, the railroad
and the other works came from
the United States.
FULFILLED A PROPHECY.
A deep impression has been
caused thruout Palestine, notes
a correspondent of the Christian
Science Monitor, by what the
inhabitants of the country re
gard as the fulfillment of ancient
prophecy. It will be remember
ed that the kaiser made a spect
acular entry into Jerusalem in
1898, riding thru a hole in the
city wall. At that time the an
cient prophecy was unearthed to
the effect that the real deliverer
of Jerusalem would enter the
city on foot. The British gen
eral, Allenby, entered the city
on foot. Also the name of the
deliverer would combine "alia"
or god, and "nabi," which means
prophet. Gen. Allenby's name
is considered everywhere in PaT
lestine to be that combination,
and the apparent fulfillment of
the old prophecy has caused
general comment.
EIGHT WOMEN KEEP A SECRET
In Placer county, Cal., J. H.
Gurgan, a hotel keeper, brought
suit against G. T. Thomas, a
farmer, over a horse, the mon
etary consideration being $75.
A jury of eight women and four
men was obtained. Mrs. P. B.
Gross, forewoman of the jury,
announced that they had agreed
upon a verdict, but declined to
announce it unless the fees were
forthcoming. The court ruled
the jury was within its rights,
and the case was continued to
give the litigants an opportunity
to "dig up," but when they fail
ed after two more postpone
ments to produce the coin, the
court dismissed the action. The
Verdict continues to be a pro
found secret, and nobody but
the jury knows who won the
suit.

There will be a special meet
ing of the stockholders of the
Nogales Building and Loan As

15th, at 4 o'clock p. m. The main
purpose of the meeting will be
to take action on the proposition
to increase the capital stock of
the association from 500,000 to
$1,000,000. The matter has been
pretty well discussed among the
stockholders and there seems
no doubt but that the increase
will be made. Other matters
taken up at the meeting will be
some other chaDges in the arti

condition and prosperous, and
has been one of the substantial
financial institutions of the city
and county for nearly 25 years.

chaeological verdict was to the
effect that the man had fallen

where the body remained all
these years without proper offi

is that death was instantaneous,
if not sooner. The archaeologist

NO CALL BEFORE FEBRUARY 15
AFTER MANY YEARS.
A little more than two hun
dred years ago a man who was
no doubt prospecting for tung
sten in the Santa Catalina moun
tains north of Tucson, myste
riously disappeared and all ef
forts to find him proved unavail
ing until Tuesday Christmas
day of last week. Prof. Byion
Cummings, archaeologist at the
State University found the re
mains and without waiting for
the slow-going officials, proceed-
The following telegram has
been sent by the Provost Mar
shal General to the governors of
all states:
It has been decided that there
will be no more formal calls for
deferred percentages of the pie
sent quota before February 15th.
While boards should, until they
have enough men finally classifi
ed in class l.send forward prompt
ly men selected under the old re
gulations to make up deficiencies
in calls already made, the result
of this decision will be that we
shall be able to give the benefit
of the new classification system
to all men whose order numbers
are so late as to place them
i within deferred percentages of
the present call.
Calls will, however, be made
very shortly under the provi
sions of Section 149 for the
special class of men there
mentioned. For the sake of com
posing the public mind and for
convenience of registrants this
information ought to be given
wide dissemination.
ONE HUNDRED PER CENT AMERICAN CLUB.
Continual activity of German spies operating through Nogales
between the United States and Mexico has brought into existence
a new patriotic society, The Hundred Per Cent American Club, to
which all American men women of Nogales and vicinity are eligi
ble for membership, says the Oasis.
The new club, headed by its president Wirt G. Bowman, will
have headquarters in the new Bowman hotel building, along with
the Department of Justice, War Trade Board and U. S. Army
Intelligence Bureau.
The Hundred Per Cent Club has the sanction of various gov
ernment departments in Nogales and will work in close harmony
with them. The reports of all members concerning suspected
spies and German agents will be strictly confidential and thorough
ly investigated.
It is known that there are scores of persons living in, and
travelling through Nogales, who come into possession of informa
tion pf value to the government, but do not know to what official
they should report. It is the idea of this club that all such per
sons, providing they are Americans, shall join and thus be able to
report any suspicious actions of Germans without publicly ap
pearing or being connected with any investigation.
There are no fees in connection with the organization and
cards of membership, good for six months, will be issued to those
who make application and whose loyalty is unquestionable. Any
one desiring to make application for membership, should fill out
the following application and forward it to the Secretary of The
Hundred Per Cent American Ciub, Nogales, Arizona:
to win this m mm spies must be jailed
"WILL YOU HELP?
If you cannot go to the trenches you should join this
club. If you have a friend or relative fighting for his coun
try you should join. Crops, munition and manufacturing
plants, grain elevators and buildings are being destroyed
by German agents. You can do your part in stopping this
by joining, stop German activities.

device was arranged by F. A.

that Mercado was off duty and
started for the American side.
When he stepped off the bridge
the centry called to him to halt.
He refused to halt and throwing
back his coat to display bis
badge and at the same time
showed that he was armed. The
sentry again called halt but
Mercado paid no attention and
the sentry fired, the shot taking
effect in the Mexican's stomache.
Mercado died in a few minutes.
The sentry was only doing his
duty as the man had no pass
port, was armed and had no
right to cross over, but was
evidently defiant.

PASSENGERS MASSACRED.
Scores of Men, Women and Children
Victims of Yaqui Cruelty.
Bringing with them heart
rending stories of the awful
massacre of passengers-Americans
and Mexicans on the ill
fated train last Wednesday
morning between Mapoli and
Lencho stations, on the Southern
Pacific of Mexico, passengers
arrived in Nogales last night
from Guaymas.
Early accounts of the terrible
slaughter of innocent, helpless
women and children, by the
fiends incarnate, were not exag
gerated. The blood crazed In
dians after the train had been
wrecked, committed acts of
cruelty far worse than the
Apaches ever thought of.
Besides the score or more
of passengers killed, among
whom were H. G. Poe, travelling
representative of the Kline
Simpson Fruit Co. ; Ralph Snovil,
auditor of the Southern Pacific
of Mexico; Manuel Paredes, con
ductor of the ill fated train;
Augustin Sepulveda, Wells
Fargo messenger; Miguel Marti
nez, brakeman; Carlos Jarilla,
clerk for A. Carpena; Alonzo
Suarez, son cf Carlos Suarez of
Nogales, Fernado Robinson,
cousin of Guillermo Robinson of
Nogales, and Carlos Lopez, news
agent, many officers and soldiers
escorting the train, were killed.
It is said that when reinforce
ments from Lencho, reached the
scene of slaughter which lasted
nearly two hours, the Yaqui
fiends, made for their mountain
stronghold, taking with them
about thirty young women and
girls, who were compelled to
help carry the loot stolen from
the dead and wounded.
As quickly as possible General
Superintendent H. J. Temple of
the Southern Pacific of Mexico,
rushed a first aid relief train to
the scene in charge of Superin
tendent W. J. Kingsbury and
Dr. H. A. Harris, who with
many assistants, did everything
possible for the victims of the
most horrible tragedy in the
history of Sonora.
As result of the tragedy,
which occurred about three
hundred miles south of Nogales,
trains are not running south of
Empalme.

SMOKING IN CHURCH.
Smoking in church is a Dutch
custom. Dutchmen are such in
veterato smokers that rarely is
one of them seen without a pipe.
He finds himself unable to de
prive himself of the indulgence,
even for the short period of a
church service. A similar prac
tice exists in several churches
in South America.
The practice is said to have
been prevalent in Great Britain
at the beginning of the seven
teenth century. At one time
smoking was carried to such an
excess'in Seville cathedral that
the chapter applied to the pope
for power to repress the abuse.
In Wales smoking in church
was indulged in as late as 1850.
In one church the communion
table stood in the aisle, and" the
farmers were in the habit of
putting their hats upon it, and
when the service began they
lighted their pipes and smoked,
without any thought of irrever
ence in the act.
ALAYEKSA OR ALASKA.
The name Alaska is an En
glish corruption or perversion
of Alayeksa, as it was called by
the aboriginal inhabitants of the
Aleutian islands, lying to the
westward.
When the Russian first came
to one of the Aleutian islands
they were told that a vast coun
try lay to the eastward and that
its name was Alayeksa. The
Aleuts called heir own island
Nagun Aleyeksa, meaning the
land lying near Alayeksa. By a
process of Russianizing and An
glicizing Alayeksa became Alas
ka, and Nagun Alayeksa became
Unalaska.
The original Aleutian word
Alayeksa meant "the great coun
try," as the inhabitants of scat
tered islands would naturally
consider a vast continental re
gian of varied resources and be
autiful scenery as Alayeksa or
Alaska has since proved to be.

Mr. Marion Holcomb, of Nancy, Ky., says: "For quite
a long while I suffered with stomach trouble. I would
have pains and a heavy feeling after my meals, a most
disagreeable taste in my mouth. If I ate anything with
butter, oil or grease, I would spit it up. I began to have
regular sick headache. I had used pills and tablets, but
after a course of these, I would be constipated. It just
seemed to tear my stomach all up. I found they were
no good at all for my trouble, I heard

me. I keep it in the house all the time. It "is the best
