The Spirit of Friendship.
This store looks upon its patrons not
merely as customers but as friends.
People purchase here because they
have friendly feeling for this store.
The cause which develops this friendly
feeling, may differ, in fact, they are
sure to differ. One's friendship for
the store is the result of finding good
values; another's is the result of effi
cient service and courteous treatment,
and so on.
Naturally this friendshiply feeling on
the part of our patrons is reciprocated
on our part. And this spirit of mutual
friendship is an impetus for greater
service and an incentive to ever-increasing
endeavor to make this store
a place where every visitor will feel
perfectly at home.

United Drive for Relief in the Far East
February 3-17.
Phoenix, Jan.- Marked pro
gress is being made in the state
wide organization which will un
dertake the task of raising 150,
UUU to rehabilitate ' the war
stricken Assyrians, .Armenians
and Jews and other' peonies of
the near east. This gigantic
task will be carried out through
a three in-one drive from Feb.
3 to 17tb.
The truth of the terrible con
ditions now prevailing through
out the Near East is revealed in
a recent appeal of President
Wilson which has taken the
form of a proclamation. This
reads in part as follows:
"For more than three years
American philanthropy has been
a large factor in keeping alivC
Armenian. Syrian, Greek and
Other exiles and refugees of
Western Asia.
"On two former occasions I
haTe appealed, to the American
people and the response has
been most generous, but now
the period of rehabilitation is at
hand. Vastly larger sums vjill
be required to restore these once
prosperous, but now impover
ished, refugees to their former
homes than were required mere
ly to sustain life in their desert
exile.
"I, therefore, again call upon
the people of the United States
to make even more generous
contributions than they have
made heretofore to sustain
through the winter months,
those, who, through no fault of
their own, have been left in a
starving, shelterless condition.
and to help re-establish these
ancient and sorely oppressed
people in their former homes in
a self supporting basis."
There are 3,950,000 sOuls,
400,000 of whom are orphans, all
n desperate need. Catholics,
Protestants and Jews alike have
been the victims of Turkish op
pression and ot Turkish govern
ment orders to exterminate or
drive from their homes and in
dustries every other people in
the Near East" says Charles
Willis, state director of the Un
ted Drive lor Relief in Arizona.
"Catholics, Protestants and
Jews alike are receiving every
help within the power of the
committee for the United Drive
n the iNear iLast, further stat
ed Mr. Willis; "every dollar that
is subscribed goes to alleviate
the suffering of these stricken
peoples; all expenses qf collec
tion and of distribution is met
privately.
The coming campaign for
funds to relieve these shattered
nations is not a Jewish move
ment, nor is it in the interest
xclusively of any one race. It
is inter-racial and inter denomi
national in character. Religious
leaders of all denominations are
taking a keen interest in plans
for the coming drive. Among
those who have agreed to act as
field organizers are Dr. H. W.
Peck, of the Methodist church
of Phoenix, Dr. E. H. Nichol
son, Methodist minister of Tern
pe, R. E. Dunlap. state superin
tendent of the Christian church
and J. E. Sexsou, secretary of
the Phoenix Y. M. C. A.
"It has the full approval and
cooperation of the United States
government. All funds are trans
mitted through the Department
of State; the Shipping Board
and all consular agents of the
United States goverment will
give every possible aid. The
commission's work is one, not
only of relief, but of repatriation
and reconstruction. The budget
includes seeds for next year's
crops, farm implements, cattle
and sheep. These people are
freed from their oppressors, but
shorn of homes and property.
Our part is to set them on their
own feet."
Mining Waiting Readjustment.
Gold production in the United
States in 1918 fell to 3,313.000
tine ounces, worth 68,493,000,
the lowest in 20 years.
Silver production dropped to
67,879,000 fine ounces, worth
67,879,000, at the standard gov
ernment price of 1 an ounce.
This is the snali-st record
since 1913, according to govern
ment reports.
California led as a gold pro
ducing state, the estimate show
ing 832,389 ounces, valued at
$17,207,000.
Colorado ranked second with
621,791 ounces, valued at 12,
853,000.
Montana, with 15,341,000 oun
ces, was the principal silver
producing state, while Utah gave
13,489,000 ounces. Idaho 10,188,
000 and Nevada 10,115,000.
The nation has not met the
problem of declining production
of the precious metals.
Total copper production fell
off in .1918 was far under normal.
The low price prevailing for
copper and lead coupled with
high cost of production has ne
cessftated a great curtailment of
production since signing of ar
mistice and pending a return of
somewhat normal conditions
Western states are. interested
in maintaining conditions en
couraging to the mining Indus
try.

"WILDCAT TING A NECESSITY.'
Few persons realize what un
ceasing effort is necessary to
secure a sufficient" supply of
crude oil in this country.
The decrease of oil well pro
duction and the increase in the
demand by tens of millions of
barrels yearly compel producers
to expend large sums in pros
pecting new territory. For this
reason "wildcat wells" are drill
ed outside the limits of43roduc
ing pools. This is a good deal
of a gamble.
The largest part of all the
known oil-fields is either being
operated by companies, or has
been withdrawn by,the government.-
Less than two tenths of one
percent of the oil area in Penn
sylvania is productive. More
than half of Wyoming's produc
tion is within a space of six
square miles. The noted Tepe
tate Casiano pool in Mexico,
which has produced 75.000,000
barrels of oil in eight years, is
only one mile wide and four
long. Much pioneer work must
be done to insure supplies of oil
The national policy in recent
years, of withdrawing oil areas
from' entry as soon as discover
ed by prospectors, coupled with
refusal to pass leasing measures
or grant relief to claimants on
withdrawn lands is rapidly dis
couraging the development of
new territory and our reserve
oil supply is declining in face of
an increasing demand.
LAND OFFICE CROWDING WORK.
Policy of the state land de
partment under W. A. Mouer,
commissioner, is to get the lauds
of the state into the hands of
users, settlers and owners at the
earliest date possible.
It is announced by the state
land board that sales aggregat
ing about 75,000 acres in this
and Yuma counties have been
ordered and will shortly take
place.
The records of the com mis
sioner's office show that all the
selections of lands under the en
abling act and other grants have
been almost completed. There
remain only about 60,000 acres
to be selected. The total selec
tion to January 1 of this year
amounted to 4,019,471. The
grant of institutional lands un
der the enabling act was 2-,350,-000,
and in lieu of lands in
school sections located on Indian
reservations there were 1,645,
689 acres.
In addition to these grants
there was the grant of the Uni
ersity lands, 46,080 acres in
1881 and additional school lands
granted to the state under the
act of June 20, 1910, amounting
to 8,057,600 acres. Beside there
was 40,000 acres of school lands
escheated to the state, making a
total of 10,453,720 acres.
The following disposition has
been made of these lands, ac
cording to the report of the land
commissioner: Total leased 5,
140,000 acres; total sold, 482,923
acres; total acres in forest, 1,
823,024; total remaining unleas
ed and unsold, 3,007,775. The

fce the sight of on honet-fo-goodics
American girl. And the combination
f the three, end maybe a couple of
mugs of good hot coffee thrown in for
food measure nobody but really
tired, hard worked Yank can reaily ap
preciate this food for the gods and
comfort for tin heart of man.
"It ain't the coffee nor the pie nor
the doughnuts, nit even the pretty
girls," said one young soldier; "It Is
the sight of a woman who looks like
four mother with her little cap a
irifie askew sometimes, and maybe a
Kick of hair straightened out of curl,
ust like mother used to have hers
rome when she was hurrying too hard
that's the thing that makes a fellow
Clad he happened to be with this par
ticular hunch. And when that woman
Ntya, 'Here, son, have another piece of
pie !' It goes right through your heart
nil makes you fee! that If you ever
rlo get back to the old U. S. A. again
you'll not forget mother's birthday and '
you'll remember to say the kind things
every single day of your life."
The Red Cross serves the lads of all
the nations, of course, but It is par-
ticulniiy pnrttnL- to the khnkf clad
youths with a bit of slang and the call
for the matches and the cigarettes.
They are the ones who appreciate the
American crackers and Jam.
There are the canteens close to the
trenches, of louiNe, and the huts where
the men may go and bnllie and have
their clothes freshened up, and the
a reilow can resi a
while,, hut the boys who have beei
there insist that they love the little
rolling canteens 'hat Jart naturally
spring up where you least expect them,
nost of all.
Many well known names are on the
lists of canteen workers, for Atneri
' can women were quick to seize the op
' portunfty for service. The poorest
soldier on his leave may lie served by
an American woman whose hospitality
was formerly dealt out by her maids
and butlers and whose guest lists In
cluded only the most fashionable
names In the social reglstpr. Now It
is she who hands ever the pie with
her own hands and then, gathers up
tbe dishes yes. and oftentimes washes
them when" help Is scarce, for they
hare to be washed and made ready
for the next lot of soldiers and one
cannot disappoint the boys who are
never too tired to respond te- the call
of duty.
Another part ef the canteen serrlea
is the "store," where the soldiers are
supplied with their needs, where
things they hare lost In the heat mt
battle are replaced, tooth paste hand
ed out, rarer blades, towels, tooth-
brushes, all sorts of things, not forget
ting the post eards to send heme and
the erer wanted packages ef cigar
ettes. '
Taking It all in all, the canteen dees
far more than All the stomachs of th
men- It puts something wrfrth while
into their hearts.

whitest men that ever lived.

years that William Schuckmann
bad resided in Nogales, he had
endeared himself to many, and

and dearly loved his adopted
country, his family and his
friends.

passing, Mr. Schuckmann was
about fifty-five years of age.

JOE TEMPLE RETURNS SOUTH
Monday H. J. Temple, general
superintendent for the Southern
Pacific of Mexico,"' with head
quarters at Empalme, returned
from Tucson, where he had been
a couple of days on official busi
ness. Tuesday morning his pri
vate car was attached to the No
gales Guaymas train.
During the many years of
turbulent times in the country
south of the international line,
the Southern Pacific of Mexico,
of which Colonel Epes Randolph
of Tucson, is president, has been
extremely fortunate in having
for its high officers in Mexico,
men who through years of ex
perience, had learned Mexico
and Mexican people.
The beads of all departments
worked enthusiastically and bar
moniously, not only fot the com
pany they represented, but for
the traveling public as well.
Many times it required wonder
ful nerve and personal courage,
to remain on the job, but they
stayed. When in years to come
the history of the Southern Pa
cific of Mexico, during the long
period of internal strife, is writ
ten, the names of H. J. Temple,
J. B. Finley, Harry Lawton, W.
J. Kingsbury, Jack Small, and
a score of others, will not be
forgotten.
CARD OF THANKS.
We desire to return our most
heartfelt thanks to all the
friend3 and acquaintance, in
cluding The Elks, who so gen
erously and kindly assisted us
in our terrible bereavement. We
shall never forget their great
kindness. Respectfully,
Mrs. Wm. Schuckmann
and daughter elsa.

the Benefit f the
Allivs.
Wlit ftcui'AS beafutt t lilw 4mf
leitPlT that U people f the United
States wen actually redm-iMC their
consumption of foeris needed abroad,
the United States Vtmrt Adminis
tration was teid that it was ctm
paratirely easy t striae aboit foaser
Tation ef staple necessities. u;tt iliat it
weniil be far mere diftii-alt t act'ona
jllf.ii an actual decrease in itse use mt
luxuries. Xty dounfrs took jujf.-tr as
an example, and declared tltat it would
be practically impossible to hrUif car
consumption of sugar down to a point
that would meet nly t fed need
f the people.
Kow that demands upon ontaa tos
aage will be lightened. Kuroieavn in
tlouc will be able to go further afield
for foodstaffs, and will no longer be
entirely dependent for sugar upon
Korth American sapplles. With the
stocks now in prospect, we will have
sufficient sugar to place this country
back upon normal eouauniptioa it the
present short rations in Europe are
mot materially increased. If the Eu
ropean ration is to be materially in
creased OTer the present low amount
It con be only through the American
people's making it possible by con
tinued restriction to a greater or less
extent here.
The fact that the Food Administra
tion bss been able to relax the toIdn
tary sugar ration is in itself proof that
the ration of two pounds per person
per month was generally observed!
throughout the country. This conser
Yufien allowed the Food Administra
tion to build up a reserre, and to tide
erer the period of scarcity, until tho
the new crops of Loufsinha cans and
beet sugar were ready for distribution.
The records of the Food Adminis
tration show that in Jaly. August. Sep
tember and October 005,000 tons were
distributed. Normal consumption for
that period is l.GOOjOOO tons. This
shows a definite, concrete saving of
rer 500,000 tons. These iigures ap
ply to sugar consumed en tbe table, in
the kitchen and in the various indus
tries, and show conclusively that in
the homes and public eating places of
America, where 7 per cent, of all our
ngar is consumed, the sugar consump
tion has been reduced ny more than
he-third.
In the four-month period begin
ning with July, this country normally
ses 400,000 tons of sugar per month.
Xidst July 2G0.000 tons entered into
distribution. In August only fc!5.000
tons were distributed. In September
the figures showed 370,000 Ions, and
then fell to 230,000 tons in October.
There could he no mors definite
proof that the American peoplo bar
given their loyal co-operation-and Ban
port of the war.
AN AMERICAN HABIT
THAT WAS EXPANDED.
Coming to the relief of the dis
tressed is not a new sensation to us.
Having sent shiploads of food to the
famine sufferers of India as offhand
edly as the housewife hands out a eat
of the lonf to the wayfarer, it seemed
the most natural thing in tbe world to
succor Belgium, to take on tha feeding
f a nation quite informally.
The test of peace is to summon for
tbe healing of 'nations devotion equal
to that given the tasks of war.
Satve SH
that Tve t&cgr chare
Sacve food
methods or Democracy.
The extent fo which the United
States Food Administrator has
relied on tha voluntary snpport
of the American people is shown
by a statement intide by tbe
United States Food Administra
tor speak lug before the Senate
Agricultural Committee less
tban three months after thin
country entered the war. That
he was Justified in bis implicit
confidence in the strength of de
mocracy has been clearly reflect
ed by the measure ofssupnort we
have lent' the Allies.
"If democracy is worth any
thing," Mr. Hoover declared, "we
can do these things by co-operation,
by stimulation, by self-sacrifice,
by the patriotic mobiliza
tion of tbe brains of Ibis coun
try. If it cannot be done in tbla
manlier it is better that we ac
cept German domination and
confess to failure or our political
Ideals, acquiesce In tbe superior
ity of the German conception
