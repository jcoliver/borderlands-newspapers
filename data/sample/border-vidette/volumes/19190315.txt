THE PATAGONIA DISTRICT.
Interesting Mining News From Last
Week's Santa Cruz Patagonian.
The Duquesne Mining & Re
duction Company has outliued
an extensive development cam
paign. It has been the policy
of this company in the past to
ship its ores as mined and but a
limited tonnage of ore was ever
blocked out. With the present
price of the metals this company
can well afford to enter a devel
opment period, at the expiration
of which time there will un
doubtedly be a very large ton
oage of ores bldcked out, and at
time this company will certainly
erect a large mill to treat its de
veloped tonnage. This com
pany has been very heavy ship
pers in the past and its present
policy will mean a great deal to
the camp.
Messrs. Gfoss and Kennedy
of Duluth, Minn., have taken an
option upon the American Boy
and Hosey properties. Their
option Upon the American Boy
property calls for a wagon road
into the property and the in
stallation of such mining equip
ment as is needed to sink a
shaft. The American boy is
owned by Messrs. Clarke and
Peterson, two of the oldest and
best qualified prospectors of this
district, and their property has
long been handicapped by not
having a wagon road to the tun
nel and shaft. With the pres
ent policy of Messrs. Gross and
Kennedy this property should
develop into a mine of consider
able magnitude.
The option on the Hqsey or
Pinal property, calls for the
sinking of a 300-foot shaft and
necessary lateral work there
from. Those who know the
Hosey property have no hesi
tancy in predicting a great fu
ture for it after this shaft is
once sunk.
The Three R mine has recent
ly encountered new ore chutes
from its lower levels. The
opening up of these ore chutes
proves the Three R to be a real
mine in any mining camp. lnis
means but little to that prop
erty, as it has long been classi
fied as a big, money-making
property. However, the find
ing oi tnese lower ore cnutes
means a great deal to the camp
as it proves the vertical depth
of ores and shows the relation
of the smaller surface ore pock
ets to the larger bodies of ore
with depth.
The Pierce Gardner lease is
shipping its regular quota of
silver manganese ores and it is
reported that this property is
opening up into a mine very
rapidly. So far this property
has only developed ore reserves;
what ore that has been shipped
has come from sinking, drifting
and upraising. With the bot
tom level in good ore and the
workings in shape to break a
heavy tonnage this property as
sumes the proportions of a mine.
W. J. Mitchell, the optimistic
superintendent of the Arizona
Consolidated Copper Mines Com
pany, with property at Mowry,
also holding the same position
with the old and well known
Mowry mine, was in Patagonia
Monday and spoke enthusiastic
ally of developments under way
at Mqwry.
Work is being pushed on the
El Paso mine, owned by the
first named company, with two
shifts of miners. A depth of a
little more than 200 feet has
been reached, cross cutting on
the 150 foot level being now un
der way. Mr. Mitchell states
they will be down 300 feet by
the end of March, and when the
400-foot level is reached it is ex
pected to strike the sulphides.
The ore in the El Paso carries
principally copper with a per
centage of silver.
The plant at the El Paso re
presents an outlay of $35,000
and it is stated there is no lack
of capital to continue develop
ment work on a large scale, and
if present indications mean any
thing it is predicted by those in
terested in the property, that
there are prospects of the El
.Paso developing into one of the
greatest producers this side of
the Inspiration.
The Arizona Consolidated is
also doing development work on
the old Olive claim to the south
of the El Paso, which in the
past has produced considerable
quantities of rich silver-lead ore.
A. J. Hazeltine, a banker of
Warren, Pa., principal owner of
the did Mowry mine, located in
the camp of the same name, is
in the district looking after his
interests. Recent developments
at the Mowry have been of such
a satisfactory character that
Work will not only be continued,
but will be carried on on an even
larger scale. A small experi
mental mill will be constructed
at once in an . effort to find a
satisfactory method of treating
the Mowry ores.
Worlf upon the 250 foot level
of the Mowry shaft has exposed
some good grade lead silver ore.
As this ore was just broken into
no estimates can be made of ton
nage, but it is presumed that it
is one of the large ore bodies
which made this property fam
ous in the past.
). B. Bachman, a mining man
who has operated in the various
districts of Arizona for the past
twenty years, was in Patagonia
Tuesday and spoke in glowing
terms of his property, the Tres
de Mayo, located in the Pata
gonia mountains ten miles south
of town. This property is an
old Spanish mine, worked suc
cessfully in former years. At
present a force of fifteen miners
is employed in development
work, a depth of 120 feet bavine
been reached. Ore is being
sacked for shipment and a small
temporary hoist will be put in
at once, to be later superseded
by a complete outfit of machin
ery Road building was begun a
month ago by Mr. Bachman and
a good highway to the property
has been completed. It is stat
ed silver lead ore carrying 500
ounces of the white metal is be
ing mined and predictions are
made that the Tres de Mayo will
soon be listed among regular
shippers.
Colonel R. R. Richardson and
Ed. Bohlinger visited the Salva
dore property, one of the Her
mosa group, a short distance
south of Harshaw, last Sunday.
Recently while cross cutting
eastward from the 40 foot level
on the Salvadore, a natural cave
was encountered. Its extent at
this time can not be determined
but work will be undertaken at
once to clear the entrance of the
cave and further explore it.
The principal output of the
Salvadore at the present is man
gaqese, but it is confidently ex
pected that further development
will open up a silverf-lead prop
erty, since it is located on the
same belt and is less than 1000
feet distant from the rich Pierce
fJardner mine.
N. A. McDonald sent out, a
car of copper silver ore from
the Hosey property in the Santa
Ritas during the week.
The Bland Mining Company
on Tuesday shipped a car of fine
looking lead silver ore from the
Trudy shaft.
The World's Fair is shipping
on an average of two cars per
week. This tonnage will be
largely increased as soon as the
roads are in better condition.
The Salt River Valley experi
mental farm near Mesa begins
this month the first sheep feed
ing experiment handling on the
farm. Two hundred head of
ewes will be divided into ten
lots and each lot will be put on
a different feed. Most of the
feeds used will be those produc
ed on the experimental farm,
namely, silage, alfalfa bay, and
rolled barley. In addition, a
few lots will receive various
amounts of cottonseed meal.
Harry L. Robicson, the El
Paso cattle buyer, was a busi
ness visitor in Tucson last week.
Mr. Robinson says there is no
call yet for stock cattle, or lor
cows, but he expects the market
will open up for them a little
later on in the season. Csttle
man. Thos. D. Fulghum, the Will

RELIEF FOR PRODUCERS OF WAR
MINERALS.
Some time ago the Arizona
Bureau of Mines began the col
lection of data relative to the
losses incurred by Arizona min
ers as a result of the sudden de
crease in the demand for war
minerals which occurred im
mediately following the signing
of the armistice.
The Director is very glad to
announce that Representative
Carl Hayden, of Arizona, on
February 24th, introduced a bill
in the House of Representatives
providing relief for producers
of manganese, chrome, pyrites,
or tungsten mined to supply the
urgent needs of the Nation in
the prosecution of the war.
This Bill has passed both the
House and the Senate, and has
been signed by the President, so
is now in force. It authorizes
the Secretary of the Interior to
"pay such net losses as have
been suffered by any person,
firm, or corporation by reason
of producing or preparing to
produce either manganese, chro
me, pyrites or tungsten in com
pliance with the request or de
mand of the Department of the
Interior, War Industries Board,
War Trade Board, Shipping
Board, or the Emergency Fleet
Corporation to supply the urgent
needs of the Nation in the pros
ecution of the war." The Bill
further provides that the Secre
tary shall consider, approve, and
dispose of only such claims as
shall be made hereunder and
filed with the Department of the
Interior within three months
from and after the approval of
the Act; that no claims shall be
paid unless it shall appear to
the Secretary that moneys were
invested or obligations were in
curred subsequent to April 6,
1917, and prior to November 12,
1918: that the minerals were
produced from -properties con
taming them in sufficient quanti
ties to be of commercial import
ance; that no profits of any kind
shall be included in the allow
ance of such claims; and. fur
ther, that no investment for
merely speculative purposes
shall be recognized in any man
ner by the Secretary.
A number of Arizona pro
ducers of war minerals have al
ready corresponded with the
Bureau of Mines and have fur
nished the data required to pre
sent their claims properly, but
it is believed that many others
ha ve failed to do this, and these
should at once send in the fol
lowing information to the Di
rector, Arizona Bureau of Mines,
Tucson, Arizona:
Name and location of property
Name and address of owner or
operator.
Date when development work
was begun.
Amount ot money expended
since the Government appealed
for increased production of war
minerals. This statement should
show for what purposes the sum
mentioned was expended.
Amount of ore mined, "but un
marketed, and its average grade.
Amount of ore blocked out
but not mined, and its average
grade.
Distance of property from a
railway shipping point, and con
dition of road thereto.
On receipt of this data the
Director will advise the pro
ducers how to present their
claims to the Secretary of the
Interior.

A DEMOCRATIC RESOLUTION.
Democrats of Arizona Declare Arizona
Gazette Un-Democratic.
Phoenix, Ariz., March 11, 1919.
We, the undei signed, do here
by certify that the following is
a true and correct copy of a Re
solution adopted, by a unani
mous rising vote, by the Demo
cratic State Party Council as
sembled in meeting in the City
of Phoenix, County of Maricopa,
State of Arizona on the 8th day
of March, A. D., 1919. There
being present at said meeting
over three hundred rerwesenta
tive Democrats from alk parts of
the State.
t
RESOL "TTON.
-Whereas, The Arizona 6a
zette, a newspaper published in
the City of Phoenix, has in both
its editorial and news columns
either wilfully and mendacious
ly, or with the grossest ignor
ance persistently falsified its re
ports of and misrepresented the
acts of the Fourth . Legislature
of the State of Arizona; and
Whereas, The said Arizona
Gazette, while professing to be
a democratic newspaper, has
maligned and villitied the demo
cratic members of the Legisla
ture by means of the most fla
grant lies, imputing to them ac
tions which have not occurred
and motives which they have
not had; and
Whereas, While the Members
of the Democratic State Party
Council and other representa
tives and members of the Demo
cratic Party in conference as
sembled recognize the benefits
to be derived from the proper
activities of the newspapers of
the State, and the spreading of
accurate and reliable informa
tion concerning the measures
presented to and acted upon by
the Legislature, they equally
recognize the peril to good Le
gislation, which is caused by
the dissemination of false and
misleading reports of such meas
ures and actions, and 'the injury
and injustice which may thus be
worked upon honest and con
scientious Legislators desirous
of doing the people's will; there
fore be it.
Resolved, By the members
of the Democratic Statd Party
Council and other representa
tives and members of the Demo
cratic Party in conference as
sembled, that the Arizona Ga
zette be and is hereby declared
to be untruthful and unfair in
its reports of and comments up
on the actions of the Legisla
ture; that it has displayed and
frequently displays in such re
ports and comments the most
wanton ignorance of the facts;
that its accounts of Legislative
proceedings and its editorial
criticisms thereof based upon
false statements of fact and in
accurate hypothesis, are inimical
to the best interests of the State
and dangerous to the cause of
good legislation; and that its'
practice of falsification and mis
representation is violative of the
most sacred principles of journ
alism; and be it further
Resolved, That the said Ari
zona Gazette is in no proper
sense a democratic newspaper;
that it does not reflect the views
or express the will of the demo
cratic people of Arizona, and is
hereby disowned and disclaimed
as a journalistic representative
thereof; that it is not to be de
peaded upon as an exponent of
democratic doctrine or as a
journal of accurate public infor
mation, and that it is worthy of
neither the support, the con
fidence or the respect of fair,
open minded, loyal citizens of
the State of whatever political
party or faith.

Councilman George V. Dun
bar, one of Nogales' best known,
most highly respected business
men, died Sunday night at St.
Joseph's hospital, following an
operation.
Mr. Dunbar had been ill only
a few days with nephritis, and
notwithstanding everything was
done, known to medical science,
he continued to grow worse, and
on Sunday night the attending
physicians decided to perform
an operation in the hope of sav
ing his life. His condition was
so serious that he was unable to
withstand the shock, and death
resulted shortly after the opera
tion. ,
News early Monday morning
of the sudden, untimely passing I
of Councilman Dunbar, loved
and greatly esteemed by every-
j body in Santa Cruz county, was
a great shock to his relatives,
business associates and friends.
In the death of Councilman
George W. Dunbar, who was
about 42 years of age, this com
munity has lost one of its most
valuable progressive citizens.
No man, during so short a
period of time, has done so much
toward the unbuilding of No
gales, the queen city of the bor
der, which he loved, than George
Dunbar. He will be greatly
missed .
To mourn his loss, deceased
leves a widow and two small
adopted children, Robert and
Helen Dunbay; and a sister, Miss
Jessie Dunbar, of Nogales. Two
sisters, Mrs. L. S. Graves and
Miss Flora Dunbar, of Jerome,
Arizona, and in Chicago, re
spectively. Also three brothers,
James J. Dunbar of Chicago,
Daniei Dunbar of Minneapolis,
and Charles Dunbar of Prescott,
Arizona.
The funeral service was held
Wednesday afternoon at the
Methodist church, Rev. A. M.
Thomas of that church. and Rev.
W. J. Gordon of the Baptist
church, officiating. The service
at the grave was conducted by
the Elks, of which grand order
George Dunbar was a member.
Interment was in the Nogales
cemetery.

Dr. Livinccton Farrand Permanent
Leader of Peace Organization.
Wnshlnjrton. (Special.) Henry P.
Iiivlson as r-hnlnnan issues the follow
ing statement on bobalf of the War
Council of the American Red Cross:
"To the American I'eople:
"The Wiy Council of the American
Bed Cross appointed by Presklent Wil
son on Miiy 10, 11)17, to carry on the
work of the American lied Cross tlur
HS the war, at their request ami by
vote of the Central Committee, ceased
at midnight, February 28.
"Immediately the armistice was
Signed the Wnr Council Instituted
studies to determine when the strict
ly war work of the organization would
have been sufficiently matured t en
able the direction of affairs to be re
sumed by the permanent staff. Henry
P. Lavlson, being In Paris when the
armistice was signed, summoned, a
conference there of the heads of all
the Ked Cross Commissions In Kurope
to canvass the situation. After con
sidering all the factors It was con
cluded to make the transition on
March 1. The very fortunate choice
of Dr. Livingston Farrand as the new
chnlminn of the Central Committee,
and thereby the permanent chief ex
ecutive of the Itcd Cross, makes possi
ble the consummation of this plan un
der the most favorable conditions.
Accounts Audited by War Department
"Detailed reports to Congress and a
complete audit of Its accounts by the
"War Department will constitute the
final record of Red Cross activity dur
ing the war. Although it has been
the rule to make public all expendi
tures when authorized and to give de
tailed Information relative to all work
undertaken, the Wnr Council In turn
ing over its responsibilities to Dr. Far
rand and his associates desire to give
a brief resume of Red Cross war time
activities to be American people, to
whom the Red Cross belong, and whose
generous contributions have made pos
sible all that has been accomplished.
"During the past nearly twenty-one
months the American people have
given In cash and supplies to the
American lied Cross more than $-100,-000,000.
No value can be placed upon
the contributions of service which
have been given without stint and of
tentimes at great sacrifice by millions
of our people.
"The effort of the American Red
Cross In this war has constituted by
far the lnrgest voluntary gifts of
money, of hand and heart, ever con
tributed purely for the relief of hu
man suffering. Through the Red Cross
the heart and spirit of the whole
American people have been mobilized
to take care of our own, to relieve the
misery Incident to the wnr, and also
to reveal to the world the supreme
Ideals of our national life.
"Everyone who has, had any part In
this war effort of the Red Cross Is en
titled to congratulate himself. No
thanks from anyone could be equal In
value to the self satisfaction every
one should feel for the part taken.
Fully 8,000,000 American women have
exerted themselves In Red Cross serv
ice. Has Over 17,000,000 Adult Members.
"When we entered the war the
American Red Cross had about 500,000
members. Today, as the result of the
recent Christmas membership Roll
Call, there are upwards of 17.000,000
full paid members outside of the mem
bers of the Junior Red Cross;, number
ing perhaps 9,000,000 school children
additional.
"The chief effort of the Red Cross
during the war has been to care for
our men In service and to aid our
army and navy wherever the Red
Cross may be called on to assist. As
to this phase of the. work Surgeon Gen
eral Ireland of the U. S. Army recent
ly said: 'The Red Cross has been an
enterprise as vast as the war Itself.
From the beginning It has done those
things which the Army Medical Corps
wanted done, hut could not do itself.'
"The Red Cross endeavor In France
has naturally been upon an exception
ally large scale where service has
been rendered to the American Army
and to the French Army and the
French people as well, the latter par
ticularly during the trying period
when the Allied World was 'waiting
for the American Army to arise In
force and power. Hospital emergency
service for our army In France has
greatly diminished, but the Itcd Cross
is still being called upon for service
upon a large scale In tt.t! great base
hospitals, where thousands of Ameri
can sick and wounded, are still receiv
ing attention. At these hospitals the
lied Cross supplies huts and facilities
for the amusement and recreation of
the nieti s.e Itaey become convalescent.
Our Army of Occupation in Germany
was followed with Medical units pre
pared to render the same emergency
aid and supply service which was the
primary business of the Red Cross
during hostilities. The Army f'anieen
Kervictt ului.g the llai-s of travel lias
actually increased since the armistice.
"As for work among the French peo
ple, now that hostilities have ceased,
the French themselves naturally pre
fer as far as possible to provide tor
their own. It has accordingly been de
termined that the guiding principle of
Red Cross policy in France henceforth
shall be to have punctilious regard to
Its every responsibility, Jut to direct
Its efforts primarily to assisting
French relief societies. The liberated
and devastated regions of Fi ance huve
been divided by the government into
small districts, each officially assigned
to a designated French relief organi
zation. "The American Red Cross work In
France was Initiated by n commission
of eighteen men who landed on French
shores June 13, 1.)17. Since then
some !),()()() persons have been upon the
rolls In France, of wlwi-t. T.OOO were
actively engaged when he armistice
was signed. An indication of the pres
14t scale of tile worfa will be obtained
from the fact that the services of O.OOO
persona are still rcqulrad. '
"Our American Fpcdit ionary Force
having largely evacuated Fngland. the
activities of the Red Cross Commis
sion there are naturally upon a dimin
ishing scale period. Active operations
are still in progress in Archangel and
Siberia.
"The work In Italy has been almost
entirely on behalf of the civilian pop
ulation of that country. In the critical
fcoure of Italy's struggle (lie American
people, through their Red Cross, sent
practical message of sympathy and
relief, for which the government and
people of Italy have never ceased to
express their gratitude.
Supplies and Personnel to Near East.
"The occasion for such concentra
tion of effort In Italy, Knglnnd. Bel
gium and even In France having natur
ally and normally diminished, it has
been possible to divert supplies nnd
personnel In large measure to the aid
of those people in the Near Fast who
have hitherto been inaccessiMe to out
side assistance, but whoso sufferings
hav been upon an nppnlli'ng scale.
The needs of these peoples are so vast
that government alone can meet them,
but the American lied Cross Is making
an effort to relieve immediately the
mere acute d'clrccs.
"An oxlen::ive gVoup of American
workers has been dispatched to carry
vitally needed supplies, and to work
this winter in the various Hallcnn coun
tries. In order to co-ordinate their ac
tivities, a Balkan commission has been
established, with headquarters nt
Rome, Italy, from which point alone
all the .Balkan centers can be reached
promptly.
"A commission has Just readied Po
land, with doctors and nurses, medical
supplies, and food for sick children
and invalids. An American Red Cross
Commission has also been appointed
to aid in relieving the suffering of Rus
sian prisoners still confined in German
prison camps.
"An important commission Is still
working In Palestine. Through the
war special co-operation has been
given to the Armenian and Syrian Re
lief Commission, which was the only
agency able to carry relief in the in
terior of Turkish dominions.
Red Cross Will Continue.
"Red Cross effort is thus far flung.
It will continue to be so. Rut the
movement represented by this work
lias likewise assumed nn Intimate place
in the daily life of our people at home.
The tinny of workers which has been
recruited and trained during the war
must not be demobilized. All our ex
perience In the war shows clearly that
there Is an unlimited field for service
of the kind which can he performed
.with peculiar effectiveness by the Red
Cross. What Its .future tasks may be
It is yet Impossible to forecast. We
know that so long as there Is an Amer
ican army In the field the lied Cross
will have a special function to perform.
"Nothing could be of greater impor
tance to the American lied Cross than
the plans just set in motion by the five
great Red Cross societies of the world
to develop a program of extended ac
tivities in the Interest of humanity.
The conception involves not alone ef
forts to relieve human suffering, but
to prevent it ; not alone a movement
by the people of an Individual nation,
but an attempt to arouse all people to
a sense of their responsibility for the
welfare of their fellow beings through
out the world. It is a program both
ideal and practical. Ideal in that Its
supreme aim Is nothing less than ver
itable "Peace on earth good will to
men," and practical In that It seeks to
take means and measures which are
actually available and make them ef
fective in meeting without delay the
crisis which Is daily recurrentn the
lives of all peoples.
"For accomplishing its mission In
the years of peace which must lie
ahead of us the Red Cross will require
the ablest possible leadership, and
must enjoy the continued support, sym
pathy, and participation in its work
of the whole American people. It Is
particularly fortunate that such n man
as Dr. Livingston Farrand should have
been selected as the permanent head
of the organization. The unstinted
fashion in which all our people gave
of themselves throughout the war Is
the best assurance that our Red Cross
will continue to receive that co-operation
which will make Its work a source
of pride and Inspiration to every Amer
ican." . Mr. Davison, as chairman of the In
ternational Commission of the Ameri
can Red Cross, has undertaken to rep
resent the American Red Cross in the
preparation of the program for extend
ed Red Cross activities, and will spend
the next several months in Europe In
consultation with other Red Cross soci
eties for that purpose.
