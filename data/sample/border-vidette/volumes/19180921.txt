merely as customers but as friends.
People purchase " here because they
have friendly feeling for this store.
The cause which develops this friendly
feeling, may differ, in fact, they are
sure to differ. One's friendship for
the store is the result of finding good
values; another's is the result of effi
cient service and courteous treatment,
and so on.
Naturally this friendshiply feeling on
the part of our patrons is reciprocated
on our part. And this spirit of mutual
friendship is an impetus for greater
service and an incentive to ever-increasing
endeavor to make this store
a place where every visitor will feel
perfectly at home.

This being a very busy season
for farmers and ranchers there
were many appeals for excuse
and Judge O'Connor was put to
his wits to retain enough to
transact business without mak
ing a second drawing.
The first case was that of the
state against Caesaio Navarro,
charged with grand larceny in
stealing $875 from the room of
his companion, one Antonio Ar
menta. The jury was out but a
few minutes and brought in a
verdict of guilty. Thus Leslie
Hardy scored a conviction in his
first case as county attorney.
WAR SAVINGS BRIEFS.
You are a better American if
you keep your War Savings
pledge.
All 100 per cent Americans
are making good their War Sav
ings pledges. Are you?
Your Savings pledge means
protection to our boys at the
front. Are you doing your share?
Keep your War Savings
Pledge. It will materially aid
the Star Spangled Banner on its
march to Berlin.
Your War Savings pledge is
the most sacred promise you
ever signed. Make it good.
The winning of the war may
swing on your War Savings
pledge. Make good that pledge.
Your conscience will not re
proach you if you make good
your War SaviDgs pledge.
When the baby of today asks
you what you did in this war,
will you tell him that you did
not keep your War Savings
pledge.
Did you mean to keep your
War Savings pledge when you
signed that card?. Then make
good.
A promise not kept is worse
than no promise at all. Make
good your War Savings pledge.
You promised the Secretary
of the Treasury he could depend
on you for a certain loan to the
Government each month. Keep
your promise without fail.
Including cash received in the
Treasury Department Saturday,
from the sale of War Savings
Securities, the total Treasury
leceipts from this source am
ounted to $009,500,135. 17, this
representing the purchase of
War Savings Stamps to the total
maturity value of approximately
$804,700,935.
TRUE DEMOCRATIC SPIRIT.
The following letters and tele
gram from Hon. Fred T. Colter's
opponents in the recent prim
aries, are self explanatory, and
show true Democratic spirit and
co operation that will assure De
mocratic victory next fall:
September 11, 1918.
Hon. Fred T. Colter,
Phoenix, Arizona.
My dear Governor:
Permit me to offer to you my
sincere congratulations upon
your victory. Not only do I
congratulate you, but I congra
tulate the Democracy of Arizona
upon the most excellent selec
tion they have made for our
candidate for Governor. You
can depend my assistance in any
and every way, and my time and
energy are yours to command.
Predicting your election by an
overwhelming majority, I am,
Sincerely yours,
Sidney P. Osborn.
September 11th, 1918.
Sen. Fred T. Colter,
Phoenix, Arizona.
My dear Fred :
Please accept my congratula
tions upon your victory in the
primaries with best wishes for
your success in the general elec
tion. Having nicked two losers
in September I am going to back
a winner in November.
Permit me to say that the
party could not have chosen for
its standard bearer a man of
higher ideals, a more loyal citi
zen nor one who will strive more
to further the best interest of
the state than yourself.
Yours very truly,
Lamar Cobb,
September 11, 1918.
Hon. Fred T. Colter,
Phoenix, Arizona.
Congratulations upon your
success in yesterday's primaries.
Best wishes for the future.
Fred Sutter.
Some Liberty Loan Slogans.
Wear your old clothes and buy
Liberty Bonds.
Liberty Bonds or German
bondage.
"Come across" or the Kaiser
will.
The soldier gives; you must
lend.
Liberty Bonds or German
taxes.
Buy over here to win over
there.
It's billions for defense or bil
lions for indemnity.
For Foch and freedom; buy
bonds.
A bond slacker is the Kaiser's
backer.
A man who won't lend is the
Kaiser's friend.
The more bonds you buy the
fewer boys will die.
Let all get on the bond wagon.
Be one of the millions to lend
the billions.
Dig up the coin and bury the
Hun.
Buy bonds before it's verboten.
Idle dollars are pro German.
Put the "pay" into patriotism.
Bonds speak louder than words
If you can't light, your money
can.
Freemen buy bonds; slaves
wear them.
REGISTRATION TABULATED.
The returns from all parts of
the county of the results of the
selective draft registration on
September 12, are all in the
hands of Arcus Reddoch, secre
tary of the local board, and have
been tabulated. The result shows
a total registration of 1,577, a
little more than the estimate
made by the board. Of this
number 551 were American citi
zens: 50, naturalized; 10 by citi
zenship of father; 04 declarant
aliens and 890 non declarant
aliens.
ALL MUST SERVE.
There is extant an idea that
state senators and members of
the legislature are exempt from
the selective draft. Such is not
the case. If they are eligible
they are subject to call; and if
they are called they must serve.
The same is true of supervisors.
THE COLORED AMERICANS.
In commuting the death sen
tences of 10 of 10 colored sol
diers convicted in the courts
martial growing out of the
Houston, Texas, riots some time
over a year ago, President Wil
son says:
"I desire the clemency here
ordered to be a recognition of
the splendid loyalty of the race
to which these soldiers belong
and an inspiration to the people
of that race to further zeal and
service to the country of which
they are citizens, and for the
liberties of which so many of
them are now bravely bearing
arms at the very front of great
fields of battle."
It is believed that the action
of the President, especially with
his reason given for his clem
ency, will meet with the approv
al of the American people.
The colored Americans as a
race have proved their loyalty
as soldiers, as workers, and as
citizens generally. There are
no exact figures of the amount
of Liberty Loan bonds and War
Savings Stamps they have purchased,-but
enough, is known to
warrant the statement that ac
cording to their means and abil
ity their financial support of the
Government has been splendid.
The Treasury Department has
on more than one occasion re
ferred to this fact. The Pre
sident's action above mentioned,
it is believed and hoped, will
bring a hearty response from
the colored Americans in the
Fourth Loan.
Women's Rights on Indian Reserve.
The doctrine of woman's rights
has finally penetrated to the
desert fastnesses of the Parker
Indian reservation, and there is
the devil to pay. Incidentally
a number of hitherto liege lords
of Indian households have found
out that in case they are leaving
the house for an evening, or for
a few days' vacation, that Mrs.
Indian had better be consulted.
It all started with the depart
ure from their homes of a dozen
middle aged, married Indian
bucks. They all left home the
same day, and they left without
consulting their wives. One or
two of them confided that they
thought they would take a little
vacation. They said nothing,
however, about taking their bet
ter halves along nor did they
see fit to impart where they
were going, what they proposed
to do or when they might be ex
pected back at the family re
sidence. They considered that
they had conceded a lot by the
mere announcement that they
were going to be away for a
while. But Mrs. Indian was not
satisfied. After the men had
gone, they held a council of war
and decided upon reprisals.
They would show those Indians
that they were not so smart as
they had thought. And a reso
lution, duly moved and second
ed, that the women take a vaca
tion of their own was put and
carried unanimously.
Diligent inquiry disclosed the
fact that the men had gone down
the Colorado river. That set
tled it. The women pushed off
upstream that evening. When,
in the course of a few days the
bucks returned, they found their
homes deserted, no fires burn
ing, no wood cut, no food cook
ed. Nobody seemed to know
where the women had gone. A
rumor that several young stags
had accompanied the squaws did
not mollify the situation.
A few days later the women
returned to their homes. The
welcomes they received varied,
it is said, from that which the
prodigal got to a "dam good
lickin, as one old buck put it.
However, the female of the
species resented this treatment,
and Indian police were appealed
to. In consequence, the most
refractory bucks were thrown
into the calaboose, where, with
the thermometer standing around
118 degrees, they had ample
time to ruminate on the rights
of women and the rapid and
somewhat annoying encroach
ment of democracy into the do
mestic affairs of the hitherto un
molested male.
PRESIDENT CARDENAS.
Monday Astolfo Cardenas, who
was elected president of Noga
les, Sonora, at the recent muni
cipal election was inducted into
office with a very simple cere
mony. In taking his exalted
position the gentleman took oc
casion to assure his political op
ponents that they have nothing
to fear from him; that he will
do his full duty and give to all
the full protection of the law.
In a former term in the same
office Mr. Cardenas manifested
a great deal of ability and pro
gressiveness, and he gave the
municipality over there a very
effective administration, com
passing many important im
provements. It is reported tnat
he has in view a program em
bracing valuable improvements
which cannot fail to be of great
benefit to the city.
The Deportation Demurrers Argued
Arguments were heard Friday
by Judge A. C. Lock wood in the
Superior Court of Cochise coun
ty, by attorneys for both sides
in the damage suits filed against
the mining companies, former
Sheriff Harry C. Wheeler and
other individuals. The main is
sue raised by the attorneys for
the defendants is that the com
plaints filed by Attorneys Struck
meyer and Cleary of Phoenix,
had not been signed, but the
name of the attorneys had been
printed, and numerous refer
ences and law points were pro
duced by counsel for the con
sideration of the court. Follow
ing exhaustive arguments, which
occupied all the forenoon, At
torneys C. T. Mathews, J. M.
Ross and C. W. Hawkins of EL
Paso, representing the defend
ants, while F. C. Struckmeyer
represented his interests. Judge
Lock wood ordered the matter
be submitted on briefs, and will
withhold decision until he has
looked into the numerous au
thorities cited by both sides. It
is expected it will be at least
three weeks before the court
will rule on the demurrer, and
the outcome is waited with in
terest. Fourth-Class Postmaster Examination
The United States Civil Ser
vice Commission has announced
an examination to be held at
Nogales, Arizona, on October
12, 1918, as a result of which it
is expected to make certification
to fill a contemplated vacancy
in the position of fourth-class
postmaster at Elgin and other
vacancies as they may occur at
that office, unless it shall be
decided in the interests of the
service to fill the vacancy by
reinstatement. The compensa
tion of the postmaster at this
office was $350 for the fiscal
year.

SEPTEMBER 21, 1918.
Bulgaria has more than half
a nation to take the hint drop
ped by Austria.
Old Vesuvius is spouting fire
works again. Probably celebrat
ing the allied victories.
The kaiser refers to it as "the
present decisive battle." This
sounds like a confession.
In the United States home
runs are being made by the
baseballists and in Europe by
the Germans.
Of course, if the gasoline is
going to be all used by the gov
ernment the motor car enthu
siasts might as well be drafted
and go to the front. There won't
be any fun staying at home.
At last a U boat has scored a
real war hit. It torpedoed and
sunk a Britisli transport loaded
with American soldiers bound
for the front. This was clearly
a victory, though the statement
that all the transport's cargo
was saved and the U-boat itself
sunk by destroyers robs it of
most of its significance.
A newer reading is: "Re
member the Sabbath day to keep
it wholly without joy riding."
It is said the California prune
crop has been greatly damaged
by the heavy rains. Always
something to give the boarding
house keeper something to worry
over.
"It is all right," says Debs,
on learning the jury's verdict of
guilty. "I have no complaint to
make." Tnat makes it satisfac
tory all around. Call the next
case of disloyalty.
At first the Germans called it
"the mythical army of the Unit
ed States." They are now call
ing it other and harder names
and doing it while looking back
over their shoulders as they run.
Neauly fourteen million men
registered under the 1918 call,
instead of thirteen million as
was estimated. In matters of
patriotic duty the American peo
ple generally do better than
they were expected to.
The: execution done by the
captured German guns which
are turned on them by the allies
is quite a handsome testimonial
to the excellence of German
manufacture. They hit the mark
when held by steady hands.
From now on persons who
want to install new telephone
service will have to pay well for
it. One of the new policies
adopted under government con
trol is that patrons must pay the
cost of putting in or changing
phones.
For a long time sufferer from
chronic heart disease, Senator
Joe Blackburn did remarkably
well in standing off the deadly
ailment until he was 80 years
old. Most any of us could afford
to have heart disease under such
conditions.
Of course our boys will pick
up a pretty fair smattering of
the French language over there,
but then it will, in all probabil
ity, be mostly hammock and
porch- swing French- not worth
a whoop on the ranch or in a
grocery store.
German prisoners complain
that American soldiers do not
know enough to stop when they
gain their objective. They do
not seem to understand that the
American soldier's objective is
Berlin, all other points being
merely unimportant way stations
The German leaders talk of
I " i-ost.ru-i n r" T? f 1 cr i ii m ni a tipanp
condition. To restore means to
make good, as it was before.
Belgium can't be restored. Its
ruined cities, its murdered wo
men and children, its destroyed
homes the Huns cannot make
good. Belgium has been cruel
ly and mercilessly sacrificpd and
the Huns will have to pay the
penalty for their crimes.
It is said that many residents
of Berlin have never seen the
American flag. Poor creatures!
But their plight will be remedied
soon. In the near future it will
only be necessary to look out
the windows of their homes to
see "Old Glory" fluttering n the
breeze.
There are many fathers and
mothers in Santa Cruz county
now who daily sean the casualty
lists that come from over the
sea, but the look of anxiety in
their faces is illumined by an
uncouscious gleam which de
notes a proud feeling of assur
ance that "the boy over there"
will do his full duty.
"The time is far past for fine
words, even from the kaiser's
eloquent lips," says the German
National Zeitung. Similar com
ments from other leading Ger
man papers show that the press
of that country does not spend
all its time in trying to mislead
the people with false reports of
the war. Now and then, under
extreme provocation, it is im
pelled to say what it thinks.
The Passing of James Dunbar.
James Dunbar, father of Town
Councilman Geo. W. Dunbar, died
at the home of his son in this
city Wednesday night and was
buried Thursday aiternoon at 4
o'clock. The old gentleman had
been in poor health for a long
time and his passing was not
altogether unlooked for.
Mr. Dunbar was born in In
verness, Scotland, in 1810. After
coming to this country he fol
lowed the trade of stone cutter
and became very efficient in this
line of work. He leaves to mourn
him four boys and three girls,
George and Jessie Dunbar of
Nogales, James and Flora Dun
bar of Chicago, Don Dunbar of
Minneapolis, Charles Dunbar of
Holbrook and Elizabeth Dunbar
of Jerome, Arizona.
Red Cross Wants Old Cloth
ing.
Beginning Monday, September
23, the people of Nogales are
requested to donate any clothing
they can spare to the Belgium
Relief Work. A fuller state
ment of what is especially want
ed will be given later. The
clothing may be sent to the Red
Cross rooms at the Santa Cruz
club, where it will be packed to
be sent overseas. The destitu
tion in Belgium demands that
we give all that we can possible
do without not only what is
useless to us.
People having tin foil may
send it at the same time as it
will save in transportation
charges.
Those unable to deliver their
packages at the Red Cross rooms
will be called upon if they tele

Catarrhal Deafness Cannot Be Cared
by local application, as thiy cannot reach

Catarrhal Dtafruas Is caused by an In

the Eustachian Tube. When this tube Is
inflamed you have a rumbling sound or
Imperfect hearing", and when It Is entirely
closed. Dcafni'ss is the result. Unless the
Inflammation can be reduced and this tube
restored to Its normal condition, hearing
will be destroyed forever. Many cases of
deafness are caused by catarrh, which Is

WORLD SHORTAGE
IN BEET SUGAR
Crops Are 40 Per Cent. Less
Than Pre-War Average Cen
tral Powers Hit Hardest.
CANE SUGAR IS ISOLATED.
Allied Beet Production Falls One-third
in Rigid War Economy
Practiced.
Tlic world today is producing forty
per cent, less beet sugar than Uie pre
war average.
Counting the American, Allied and
German-Austrian crops, as well as the
neutrals, the U. S. Food Administra
tion lias estimated that the world
shortage created by the light crop of
1917-101S is at least three and a half
million tons.
That the 1017-1918 crop of cane sug
ar was two million tons In excess of
the previous year does not relieve the
general shortage.
Cuba and Java produce one-half of
the world cane crop, and the Java sugar-
Is too far removed from America to
transport when shipping is badly need
ed to transport and maintain the mili
tary forces in France.
In Java a large part of the old sugar
crop is still awaiting shipment. Since
It requires 150 to 100 days for each
boat that is sent to Java, the possibili
ties of obtaining adequate shipments
of Java sugar this season are remote.
Allies' Production Falls.
Taking tha Allied nations as a group,
official reports show that beet sugar
production Is less by one-third than the
pre-war average.
French beet sugar industry has suf
fered most by the war. The French
yield of beet sugar is now only 29.1
per cent, of the pre-war average.
For the five years preceding the out
break of hostilities in Europe, France
produced an average of 702,542 tons of
sugar each year. For 1917-18 the
French production as 219,410 tons.
With CI factories operating, as com
pared with more than 200 that were
In existence before the war and before
'the general campaign of destructive-
ness launched by the German armies,
France nevertheless managed to manu
facture more beet sugar In 1917-18
than In 1916-17, when the total output
was 202,415 tens.
Italy In 1917-18 produced 100,800
tons of beet sugar, which was 50,000
tons less than the previous year and
110,250 less than the annual output of
sugar for the five year pre-war pe
riod. One of the great difficulties experi
enced In Italy's beet sugar industry
was finding sufficient labor to handle
the crop. Thousands of men usually
employed In beet sugar production
were called for military service. The
yield per acre amounted to approxi
mately half of the usual quantity of
beets harvested.

Ninety-five per cent, of all refined
agar sent from the United States to
!tne Allied nations went to r ranee au
Belgium during the first five months
of this year.
France got 72 per cent., or nearly
83,000,000 pounds, and Belgium receiv
ed nearly 11,000,000 pounds, or 23 per
cent.
In each country this sugar was doled
out by a strict rationing organization.
The entire amount to the Allies in
these five months 23.791 tons, almost
half of which was shipped in May is
only about one-half of 1 per cent, of
our total annual consumption.
SUGAR EXPORTS SMALL
TO NEUTRAL NATIONS
Only 797 tons of refined sugar were
Shipped from America to neutral na
tions during the first five months of
this year. This amounted to only 3.2.
per cent, of the total exports to all
countries. Mexico received more than
half the amount we exported to neu

Mr. Marion Holcomb, of Nancy, Ky., says: "For quite
a rong while I suffered with stomach trouble. I would
have pains and a heavy feeling after my meals, a most
disagreeable taste in my mouth. If I ate anything with
butter, oil or grease, I would spit it up. I began to have
regular sick headache. I had used pills and tablets, but
after a course of these, I would be constipated. It just
seemed to tear my stomach all up. I foiftid they were
no good at all fcr my trouble, i heard
THEDFORD'S

me. I keep it in the house all the time. It is the best
liver medicine made. I do not have sick headache or
stomach trouble any more." Black-Draught acts on
the jaded liver and helps it to do its important work of
throwing out waste materials and poisons from the sys
