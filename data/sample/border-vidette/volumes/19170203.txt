The National Forest prize for
the best fire record in Arizona
and New Mexico was awarded to
the Coconino Forest Reserve,

The present Normal school
year is regarded as one of the
most successful in the history of
the institution. The attendance
in all departments has passed
the seven hundred mark, and
there will be nearly one hundred
graduates.
Word of the aopointment of a
Register to the U. S. Land office
at Phoenix comes as good news
to many of the settlers in the
Sonoita Elgin district whose
Applications to make Final Proof
have been held pending, subject
to the filling of the vacancy in
office caused by Col. Weedin's
death.
Bulletins posted in the South
ern Pacific offices at Bowie an
nounce the establishment at that
point of a freight division term
inal. The creation there of a
freight division is said to be due
partly to increasing freight traf
fic and partly on account of the
long haul from Lordsburg to
Tucson.
Announcement that the South
ern Pacific company has adopted
the plan of building all its wood
en freight cars, such as box and
flat cars, at its own shops and
will make them from lumber
produced along its lines, was
made by President Wm. Sproule,
who returned from New York
and other eastern cities.
As further evidence that the
Patagonian country is the great
est cattlegrowing region in the
world, a calf not quite ten months
old, raised on the Sonoita grant
just below town, was sold to
the' Parker Bros. Meat Market
this week by Manager North
craft of the grant, which weigh
ed exactly 39-1 pounds dressed.
Congressman Hayden's bill to
relieve owners of mining claims
who have been mustered into
the federal service from per
forming the assessment work on
claims has been faborably re
ported to the house of represen

retary Lane of the department
of the Interior has recommended
the passage of the bill.
Reopening of the boundary
dispute between Yuma and Mari
copa counties may be permitted
by the state supreme court. A
motion for leave to file an am

is striving to recover a strip of
land four miles wide from Mari
copa county. The land now
contains valuable mines.

He is accompanied by a party of
Kansas City men interested in

Tuesday morning carpenters
began work of building an addi

if this proves insufficient to care
for the influx of transients he
will go still further in enlarging
the Ryan hotel. Chloride Her

of wood in Oatman which is ex
periencing the worst fuel famine
in its history. Under ordinary
circumstances Oatman depends
upon Indians for wood, the Wal

This stuff sells for $29 a cord.
Merchants are selling their store

the recent order of the secretary
of the Ulterior fixing the cost of
the Salt River Project at $00 an

ping ore and concentrates from
this station, notwithstanding
published reports that they in
tended to change their shipping
station to Zorilla, the little Mex
ican station on the other side of
the line, a few miles below the
mine. The caterpillars are en
gaged on the haul to the Mex
ican station, but all the big
freight teams are still hauling
to Patagonia, and indications
are the haul will continue this
way for an indefinite period, as
the teamsters very wisely refuse
to take any chances on having
their outfits stolen by maraud
ing bands of Mexican bandits,
which might happen if they
hiuled to the Mexican station
instead of Patagonia. For the
down haul the freighters are
paid $6 per ton, and if they are
loaded on the return trip they
make $5 per ton. During the
past month the Duquesne com
pany bas shipped to the smelt
ers eighteen 50 ton cars of ores
and concentrates. Patagonian.
CARL HAYDEN MAKES PROTEST
The agricultural appropriation
bill which has passed the house
contains a number of items that
are of direct interest to the peo
ple of Arizona. The ten nation
al forests in Arizona have been
allotted the following sums for
maintenance and improvements
during the fiscal year beginning
July 1, 1917:
Apache forest in Greenlee and
Apache counties, $8079; Coco
nino forest, near Flagstaff, $12,
107; Coronado forest, in south
ern Arizona, $9044; Crook forest
in Gila and Graham counties,
$735: Dixie forest, in Mohave
county, $1596; Kaibab forest,
north of the Grand Canyon,
$2708; Prescott forest, $6255;
Sitgreaves forest, in Navajo
county, $8341; Tonto forest in
Maricopa and Gila counties,
$4525; Susayan forest, near Wil
liams, $954.
When the appropriations for
the national forests were under
consideration in the house, Con
gressman Carl Hayden strongly
protested against the proposed
increase in grazing fees. He
stated that at the present rates
charged for cattle and sheep the
Arizona forests were now self
sustained, and that the stock
men of Arizona were opposed to
being taxed to make up deficits
which are incurred by the forest
service in other states. No ac
tion could be taken by the house
because the contemplated raise
in the grazing rates is not to be
made by an act of congress, but
by a regulation issued by the
secretary of agriculture.
LIVE STOCK HOMESTEADS
That the 640 acre homestead
will help to secure actual settlers
on the range is evidenced by the
fact that the land office is receiv
ing from twenty-five applications
a day through the mail for live
stock homesteadt under the new
law recently passed, and have
about as many more presented
in the office personally by ap
plicants is an accompany peti
tion for designation of the land
as being subject to entry under
the law. But few applications
coming by mail have these ac
companying petitions, and they
will have to be supplied before
any action is taken on them.

THE MOWRY MINES.
Famous Old Santa Cruz .County Prop
erty to Resume Operations.
The Tucson Citizen says:
"Probably one of the biggest
and most interesting mining
deals that has been brought to
Our attention of late is the culm
ination of the sale of the famous
Mowry Mines to the Standard
Metals company. Negotiations
have been pending for sometime
past for the re opening of the
Mowry, but it was pot until a
few days ago that Theron Wal
ker, a Los Angeles broker, re
ceived a telegram fcom the East
that a satisfactory purchase price
had beea arrived at and the deal
was now closed. The Mowry
property consists of 24 patented
claims, or 420 acras, on which is
situated the town of Mowry,
with postoffice, school, smelter
and everything else pertaining
to a large mining camp. The
Standard Metal company's chief
engineer, Wm. J. Mitchell, is
now at the Mowry, and it is
believed extensive operations
will begin at an early date and
that the mine will soon again re
gain its old time activity.
"The Mowry is located about
nine or ten miles south of Pata
gonia, and supples for the camp,
as well as ore from the mine, are
handled from this railroad sta
tion. There is an interesting
tale attached to the far famed
Mowry Mines, for during the
American operations preceding
the Civil War the property, then
known as the "Patagonia
Mines," was the most noted and
richest in these regions.
"The mineral deposit was dis
covered in 1858, and its discov
erer, named Johnson, sold it to a
number of army office'rs who
operated the property for a time,
then selling it to Sylvester W.
Mowry, who had been a lieuten
ant in the army, resigning to
engage in that enterprise. Lieut.
Mowry erected a reduction plant
and conducted operations on an
elaborate scale for those times.
He smelted the ores in reverber
atory furnaces, the product
being lead bars, rich in silver,
that were transported to Guay
mas by wagon, thence by sea to
Swansea, in Wales, where the
metals were separated and the
silver refined. It is reported
that in the course of two or three
years the output exceeded one
million dollars.
"In 1862 the property was seiz
ed by American military author
ities in Arizona, and Mowry was
placed under arrest, charged
with treason. He was kept in
confinement several months at
Fort Yuma and then released.
The property, however, was not
restored to him. The specific
charge of treason against Mowry
was that he had shipped lead to
the South that was cast into
Confederate bullets that were
used against the Federal armies
in the Civil War. Farish, the
official historian of Arizona,
states that Mowry endeavored
fruitlessly to secure from the
government reparation for the
damage done in seizure of his
property, writing extensively to
bring his case to public attention,
and that a few years later he
died in poverty in London. Mc
Clintock gives a different ver
sion. According to that histo
rian, Mowry did succeed in col
lecting $40,000 from the general
government, which sum was
paid in 1868, shortly after which
paymeut Mowrydied in London.
Mowry's writings calling atten
tion to the rich mineral resources
of Arizona . and Sonora, in his
endeavors to right his own
wrongs, are valuable contribu
tions to the annals of both states.
"Several times since Mowry's
day have the Mowry Mines been
worked, and about a dozen years
ago there was erected a reduc
tion" plant of goodly size and
capacity, handling about 100
tons of ore daily. The mine was
explored to a depth of 500 feet.
Litigation terminated operations,
however, until the last few
months, when some parties leas
ed the property and worked it
on a small scale up until the
time negotiations were started
for its purchase by the Standard
Metals company."
AMERICAN DESIRES PEACE.
Gradually it has been forced
to attention of the people of the
whole world that the United
States, not only as a nation but
as an united people, ardently
desire cessation of hostilities in
Europe. There was a time when
our citizens were accused of
greed and of a desire to make
money out of the great war. That
might have been true as regards
a few individuals but such senti
ment found no lodging place in
the hearts of real Americans.
Being able to enter into indus
trial competition with the re
sidents of any country, owing to
our vast natura 1 resources and
advantages, there is no desire
to profit by means of war. When
peace does come there will be
a healthy demand for our pro
ducts from many sources now
not accessible. Further, the
demand for industrial construc
tion will be much greater than
the necessity of purchases for
destruction. But be that as it
may the people, of American
desire peace, not alone between
this nation and other countries
but between all the nations and
peoples of the world. Ex".
PREPARING THE PRINCIPAL BILL.
Short sessions so far have
been the rule with the legisla
ture but that does not really
mean idleness. On the other
hand committee work goes ahead
with vigor. The appropriation
bill, usually left until the last
days of session and ever a bone
of contention, has been taken
up early this time and daily
meetings are held. Estimates
have been received from the
various department heads so
that the budget is fairly com
plete. There is no tendency
toward parsimony but there is a
desire to practice rigid economy
without hampering the work
necessary to be done by the vari
ous boards and departments that
are maintained by the state.
When the appropriation bill is
ready, the legislature may ad
journ at any time without loss to
the people of Arizona. Mes
senger. World-Wide Monroe Doctrine.
President Wilson has astound
ed and electrified the world with
his speech before the United
States senate, in which he pro
poses a world wide Monroe doc
trine as the means of arriving at
world peace. Said the President:
"I am proposing government
by the consent of the governed;
that freedom of the seas, which
in international conference after
conference, representatives of
the United States have urged
with the eloquence of those who
are the convinced disciples of
liberty; and that moderation of
armaments which makes of ar
mies and navies a power for or
der merely, not an instrument of
aggression or of selfish violence.
"lam proposing, as it were,
that the nations should with one
accord adopt the doctrine of
President Monroe as the doctrine
of the world. That no nation
shall seek to extend its policy
over any other nation or people,
but that every people should be
left free to determine its own
policy, its own way of develop
ment, unhindered, unearthed,
unafraid the little along with
the great and powerful."

ROAD TO FORT HUACHUCA.
Two Government Departments Will
Complete Highway.
The completion of the new
army highway from Port Hua
chuca to the western edge of the
military reservation, and of the
road by the forestry department
from here to Canille postoffice,
for which aii appropriation of
$2000 was announced yesterday
by Forest Supervisor Don P.
Johnston, will cut off a number
of miles on the auto route be
tween Bisbee and Douglas and
Nogales, and also make a better
route between Tucson and Port
Huachuca, says the Arizona Star.
The forestry department ap
propriated $6000 some time ago
for work on the road from Ca
nille to the reservation, with
the understanding that the war
department would finish the road
inside the reservation to the fort.
After most of the road had been
built, the war department failed
to make an allowance for the
road, and the forestry depart
ment stopped building, leaving
about a mile of the hardest sec
tion to be finished.
About a week ago the war de
partment announced that there
had been an appropriation made
of $9000 for the completion of its
share of the road, and in order
to make complete the remaining
gap of -a mile, the forestry de
partment has made an extra ap
propriation of $2000, which was
announced yesterday by Super
visor Johnston.
Work will be started imme
diately on both forestry and mil
itary sections of the road and it
is expected that it will be com
pleted within a short time. It
leads through a rough country
Huachuca and some of the con
struction work will be very dif
ficult. The new road will connect at
the west and with a first-class
road from Nogales and Patago
nia, and also with the road from
Tucson. This makes a direct
road both from Nogales and Tuc
son into the fort and will be very
bandy for autoists from Tucson
who have been obliged to go
along further east on the state
highway before turning into the
fort road, which made hard
grades for the machines.
It will also make a direct road
from Bisbee and Douglas to No
gales, and autoists who have
been obliged to make a wide de
tour to the north along the state
highway can go directly through
to Canille and thence to Nogales.
Supervisor Johnston, of the
Coronado forest, regards it as
one of the most useful roads in
the whole forest reserve and is
much pleased over the plan of
cooperation between the two de
partments in getting the road.

MEXICO'S NEW CONSTITUTION.
No More Concessions for Foreigners-
I Artrcle 33.
Qoeretaro, Jan. 31 The con
stitutionalist assembly yesterday
passed article U3 of the constitu
tion, which provides that the
president may expel, without
prior trial, foreigners whose
presence in the republic is con
sidered troublesome. The article
also provides that foreigners
may not take part in the politics
of the country, take possession
of land, acquire landed property,
or obtain concessions to exploit
the products of the soil unless
they renouce their character as
foreigners and the protection of
their government, and all that
pertains to the titles in question,
and remain completely subject in
this respect to the laws and
authorities of Mexico.
The assembly also passed ar
ticles of the constitution dealing
with lands, which provided that
the nation owns all natural re
sources. - Under this article only
Mexicans, or foreigners who re
linquish treaty rights, can ac
quire right of possession of lands
and water. 'No church may ac
quire, administer or possess real
estate.
Commercial or oil companies,
or manufacturers of oil, may hold
no more land than is neccessary
for their purposes. The decision
as to their holdings is to be left
to the president. Foreigners
who acquire property by waiving
their rights forfeit it if they in
voke the aid of their govern
ments. Foreigners may not ac
quire land within 1 10 kilometers
of the border or 50 kilometers
from the shore. In no case may
they acquire direct control of
land or water. Under this article
religious associations may not
take mortgages on real estate.
MAY BREAK WITH GERMANY.
Washington, Feb. 1. What
ever course of action President
Wilson has chosen to meet
Germany's declaration of unre
stricted warfare is known only to
three or four members of his offi
cial family. Neither the cabinet
as a whole nor the foreign affairs
committee of congress have
been taken into his confidence.
One high official close to the
president declared tonight that
no communication had been sent
to Berlin or to Count von Bern
storff . who out ward ly was expect
ing a severance of diplomatic
relations.
There was every indication in
official quarters that a note had
been determined upon, but the
indications as to whether it ac
tually had been dispatched were
about evenly divided, with a high
officials as authority that it had
not, and some others who gave
intimations of a belief that it had.
From under the curtain of of
ficial silence, drawn closely over
every move today, came various
indications taken every where
as index fingers pointing toward
the probable course of the Un
ited States.
It was undisputed that the
government would not permit
Germany's announcement to
stand without challenge.
But whether President Wil
son's answer will be a solemn
warning of a break in diploma
tic relations if Germany's cam
paign of ruthlessness is carried
into execution, or actual sever
ance of relations without further
waiting, remained undisclosed.

RECORD TO BE PROUND OF.
Only five weeks j-et remain of
President Wilson's first term in
office. No president since the
time of Abraham Lincoln has
had so many complex problems
to solve as he has. particularly
during the past two and one-half
years of his incumbency of the
office.
A war with which there is
nothing in the history of the
world to compare, involving
fourteen separate nations of
Europe, has been waging with
a bitterness never before ex
perienced between combatants,
and it has been by only the most
adroit msthods that our own
country has been prevented from
being drawn into the terrible
vortex of slaughter.
The most binding treaties
which could be entered into have
been violated, international law
has been ignored and the rights
of neutrals have been trampled
upon by the warring nations
indiscriminately.
That this country not only
enjoys peace at the present time,
but the highest degree of pros
perity in its history has been due
to a large degree to the prudence
and wisdom of its chief ex
ecutive. Many of the most beneficent
laws which have been placed on
the statute books of the nation
within a half century have been
suggested and promoted by him
and under his guidance, in all of
which are not only shown the
wisdom of their provisions
but
the perfect elimination of
per-
sonal motives and partisan
ad-
vantage.
They have been for the good
of the general public, of the
whole people, and not for a pre
ferred class. Wisdom and just
ice have been combined in their
construction and whenever pol
itics has undertaken to project
itself into their consideration his
command has been "get thee
behind me, satan."
All records of previous ad
ministrations pale into insignifi
cance by comparison with his.
Industrial activity was never so
general. Money is plenty. The
demand for labor exceeds the
supply, and wrges are higher
than ever before.
All the recognized indices of
business conditions tell the same
story. Postal receipts, gold
supply, bank deposits, bauk
clearings, railway earnings, in
come tax and the"national wealth,
all testify to the same condi
tions, While the titanic struggle
going on in Europe has stimulat
ed some of the industries, these
form a very small portion of the
total which is enjoying the pros
perity. No country ever had the solid
gold foundation for its business
that the United States has today,
with about one-half of the gold
supply -of the world. The na
tion's wealth has increased from
187,000,000 to $228,000,000 be
tween the years 1912 and 1916,
or a gain of twenty-one and
eight tenths per cent in the four
years.
With this record to look back
to, of his present administratian,
it will tax not only the president
himself but the people as well to
exceed it during the next four
years from March 4, when he
will enter upon his second term.
The democratic party has re
ason to be pround of the achieve
ments of the man of its choice in
1912, and the man not only of its
choice but of the people's choice
as well in 1916. Arizona Gaz

the value of Mexican silver at
1.80 pesos for one dollar Amer
ican money, superceding the
former rate of exchange two
pesos for one American dollar.
This rate applies to payment of
duties and wages, increasing
both by ten percent, it was
claimed .
Under recent rulings duties
and wages must be paid in Mex
ican gold or silver. No Mexi
can gold being obtainable, silver
pesos must be used.
This ruling was made by the
Mexican government, officials
admit, for the purpose of taking
advantage of the high price of
silver, as contained in each peso.
However, Americans affected
claim the government by the
ruling has advanced an impos
sible proposition; that the Mex
ican gold peso, which is equiv
alent to the silver one, has in
creased similarly in value,
although its actual value is a
fraction under 50 cents American
money. The real effect, they
say, has been to destroy the work
of 40 years by removing the
country from a gold to a silver
basis.
Tony Friberg, the biggest man
in Arizona, who has been in
Tombstone on jury service, re
turned to his home in Bisbee to
day, having been excused by
Judge Lockwood. Friberg, who
is known as the Big Swede, is a
man of immense stature, is an
Elk and has resided at Bisbee
for many years. He has travel
ed the world over and is jovial
and happy. To save trouble he
carries a card with him with a
number of quories answered be
fore hand which lie usually
hands to a new' acquaintance,
answering anticipated questions,
such as: "Yes, I am eiht feet
tall, weigli a sixth of a ton, am
healthy, eat the best my money
can buy, yes, my bat is 73, my
collar 18, sleep well, and you will
do me an injustice to mention
rheumatism." Friberg makes a
hit everywhere he goes, especial
ly with the kids who call him the
giant, and while in Tombstone
his visit was no exception. His
friends say he prevailed upon
the court to excuse him because
he could not find a bed in Tomb
stone big enough for him to
sleep in. Prospector.

SURPRISING FIGURES.
It is rather surprising that, in
view of the steady increase in
the number of states in the
"dry" column, the amount of
whiskey consumed b.y the Amer
ican people last year was great
er than in any previous year
since 1909. Strange and mysti
fying as it may seem, the in
creased consumption of booze is
shown by cold figures, namely,
tax returns to the internal re
venue division of the treasury
department. Although it is some
times claimed that figures do lie,
such a contingency is not likely
in the collection of taxes on
whiskey by the ever-elert re
venue officers of the govern
ment. States, cities and towns
may fail to gather in the taxes
they impose on liquors, but pur
veyors seldom ever attempt to
"get by" without paying Uncle
Sam what is due him; the penal
ty therefor is too great.
Government figures just made
public at Washington show that
the tax receipts on whiskey and
beer last year amounted to $252,
708,935, as compared with $223,
712,934 in 1915. Although great
er than in 1915, beer consump
tion last year fell nearly 5,000,
000 barrels below the high mark
of 66,000,000 barrels in 1914. It
would seem that all degrees of
prohibition thus far devised do
not prohibit, or that the increase
in the use of whiskey and beer
last year was, as some officials
believe, due in part to the fact
that the government is at pre
sent collecting taxes on all spir
ituous liquors produced in the
country, which is said not to
have been the case a few years
ago. This contention will re
main merely a matter of opinion
and conjecture until proven and
there is probably no way to es
tablish the fact beyond doubt.
To say the least, the figures
made public afford a problem
that both "wet" and "dry" ad
vocates will no doubt endeavor
to explain to their respective
advantage for some time to come.

Need of Increased Water Supply.
In a study of the cattle ranges
throughout the state of Arizona,
the water supuly will not per
mit the ranges to be stocked to
their maximum carrying capa
city. Cattle are required in
many cases, to travel miles for
water which not only tramples
the grass under foot, but takes
the time and energy of the cattle
when it should be used in gather
ing grass, browse or other food
for the maintenance of the body.
The ranges of Arizona are not
overstocked. Large areas are
made practically worthless for
grazing purposes by the. absence
of water.
With a gi-owing demand and
the increased price for range
cattle it is becoming necessary
for the grazing lands to be stock
ed to their maximum carrying
capacity, and this connot pos
sibly be obtained until an in
crease in the number of water
ing places is provided. It does
not matter how fine the grass
and forage may be, cattle will
not thrive unless they have
plenty of accessible drinking
water.
Several things must be taken
into consideration in the locating
of the watering places; that is,
the character of the range over
which the stock is compelled to
travel to reach water, whether
it be mountainous or level, rocky
or timbered. In mountainous or
rocky districts stock should not
be made to travel to exceed one
half to two miles for water,
while On levfl rancrps tl-ior mn-ir
go as far as three miles. Of
course, wnen compelled to do so,
thev will travftl mnoh farhlipr
than this, but when they are
compelled to exceed these dis
tances tney are likely to enter
the winter season in very poor
flesh. G. W. Barnes. livpstor-.k
