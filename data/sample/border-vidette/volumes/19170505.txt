NOGALES BRIEFS.
Local and Personal Items Gathered
During the Week.
General Superintendent H. J.
Temple of the Southern Paoilic
of Mexico, was a visitor in No
gales a con pie of clays this week,
on company business. Mr. Tern
nle makes his headquarters at
Km pal me.
At the meetiner of the Nogales
Rille Club last Sunday, Captain
Fuqua. 12th Infantry, U. S. A.,
delivered a splendid address,
which, was greatly appreciated
by members of Nogales' crack
rifle "club.
Gus Quickenstadt, traveling
auditor for the Southern Pacific
of Mexico, with headquarters at
Tucson, was a southbonnd pass
enger last Tuesday, en route to
Mazatlan, and other points in
the south country.
General Plutarco Elias Calles,
candidate for governor of Sono
ra, has been in the city several
days, having arrived Monday by
automobile, from Agua Prieta.
His friends are predicting his
election on May 13th, by a big
majority. Upon his arrival in
Nogales, General Calles was
given a rousing welcome.
Monday the followincr well
known young men of Nogales
made application to Major Whit
worth, district adjuntant of No
gales, for entrance to the of
ficers' training School at San
Francisco: Robert H. Karns,
Arthur H. deRiemer, E. A. Tit
comb, Brisco Kibbey, Arthur
Martin, Herbert R Chatham,
Duane Bird, LeRoy Wyrick,
Malcom Middleton, H. M. Co
chran, Frank Fitch, Edward J.
Ralph and William G. Brown.-
The mill at the Wandering
Jew mine is going up in good
order. The new road to the
mine is already completed, and
that it is a good one is evidenced
by the taking of the 8300-pound
crusher over it with no mishaps.
It is expected that early in May
there will be ore passing through
it when the mine will be manned
to extract ore. About 20 men
will be employed in the mine,
while the mill will be run two
shifts to take care of the ore
produced. Patagonian.
VOLUNTEER TODAY.
Join Arizona's Crack Infantry at Naco
and Prevent Drafting.
Under the provisions of the
new Federal bill men who vol
unteer for service with the Na
tional Guard between now and
the date of the effectiveness of
the draft, will be discharged at
the close of the war, but there
is no such provision for the men
who are drafted, neither is there
an opportunity to chose services
as is possible now. The Ariz
ona quota will call for two thous
and men. According to the
military authorities of the State
this will take about every avail
able unmarried man of military
age in the state. This being
true the thing for the young men
to do is to volunteer for duty
now and fill up the regiment
right away. By so doing they
can get out as soon as the trouble
is over, but they can be kept as
long as the war department wants
tc keep them under the draft
provisions. Another advantage.
About 60,000 officers will be
needed to officer the new troops;
these men will be chosen from
the regular and National Guard
regiments now in the service.
Men who enlist as privates now
have a chance for a commission
better with the National Guard
than with any other organiza
tion that has yet been mention
ed. Another advantage. Men
who volunteer now can go with
the home boys and be with
friends and comrades all the
time; when men are drafted,
comrades from the same village
and town are likely to be separ
ated into various arms of the
serve and have no chance to
service together. Further they
have no choice about the matter
either. The moral of this is
"Volunteer today". Join Ariz
ona's Crack Infantry at Naco.
Recruiting is going on continually.
UNIVERSITY OF ARIZONA.
Faculty and Students Respond to Call
of the Nation.
The call of the Nation for
service in the many fields of en
deavor created by the present
crisis, has given the University
of Arizona an opportunity to
show its patriotism and to de
monstrate its ability and readi
ness for service. From the time
of its orgonizaCion, the Univer
sity has made military training
an important feature in its
curriculum, and that has shown
itself in the fact that a number
of the officers of the Arizona Na
tional Guard now on the border
doing duty are graduates of the
University.
The creation of the Officers
Reserve Training Corps was so
enthusiastically accepted that
the University will lose even
before the ordinary time taken
for commencement the majority
of its men students and it is
probable that witnin the next
week between 20 and 30 men in
the Upper classes will be called
to the training camp at the
Presidio, San Francisco, Cal.
Over 80 of the men of the Institu
tion have enrolled in the Of
ficers' Reserve Corps, and the
engineers almost to a man are
enrolled in the Engineer's Corps.
Practically every girl of the
University is enrolled for Red
Cross Service and are receiv
ing first aid.
Dr. von KleinSmid, president
of the University, as head of the
Intercollegiate Intelligence Bu
reau of the State, has been in
communication with the alumni
of the Institution to ascertain
when, and how they may best
serve the Nation," and almost as
a unit tney have responded that
they are ready for immediate
service in their various fields.
Dr! von KleinSmid, also as
chairman of the Food Production
and Distribution Committee, of
the State Council for Defense,
has an important work laid out
for him. Dr. A. E. Douglas dean
of the College of Liveral. Arts
and Sciences, and Professor
Charles F. Willis, Directors of
the State Bureau of Mines, as
members of the State Council of
Defense, have been assigned to
the work on scientific research.
Practically every member of
the faculty has signified their
intention and desire to put his
his entire time, if necessary, on
such work as the government
may assign to him, and the
trustees of the University have
offered to the State and to the
Nation the entire plant, its
equipment and personnel, for
government use if desired.
Truly, no institution could
respond more readily to the call
of the Nation than the Univer
sity of Arizona.

'THE BOWMAN."
"The Bowman," a handsome
new up to date hotel, soon to be
bnilt by Wirt G. Bowman of this
city, on the site of his proposed
apartment house, on Grand ave
nue, will be a credit to its owner
and the city of Nogales.
"The Bowman" will cost in
the neighborhood of one hun
dred thousand dollars, and will
be built with a view of making
guests comfortable at all times.
Besides every other possible
convenience for guests, there
will be a large lobby and sample
rooms for traveling men, who
will find in Nogales, a place
they can call "home."
"The Bowman" is sure to be a
big dividend-payer.
LOCAL ITEMS.
Agent Pope of the Southern
Pacific Co., has returned from a
visit to his ranch in California,
and is again looking after his
big company's local business.
Mrs. Pope, who accompanied
her husband, remained at the
ranch.
County Assessor Wager has
notified automobile owners that
their auto tax is now past due,
and if not paid, cars will be seiz
ed and held for non-payment of
takes. There are more than two
hundred automobile owners in
Santa Cruz county who have no
real estate.
Alex K. Mench, a soldier of
the 12th Inlantry, who confessed
to Chief of Police Fowler that he
had robbed the Nogales Theatre

military camp. He will be pro
secuted by both the police and
military authorities.
Plans for an elegant new re
sidence to be built for W. G.
Bowman and family, on Cavalry
Hill, have been submitted by M.
Eugene Durfee, the architect.
When completed, it is said the
Bowman home will be one of the
finest in the southwest. The
grounds will be improved and
beautified at once.

Washington Trading Company,
was here yesterday from Pata

Low boiling points do it the first links in a
continuous chain of boiling points. Low boiling
points for easy starting, medium boiling points
for quick and smooth acceleration, and high
boiling points for power and mileage.
Red Crown is a straight distilled gasoline.1
Hence there's a continuous chain of boiling
