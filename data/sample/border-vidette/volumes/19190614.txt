FROM TUCSON TO PORT LOBOSj
Proposed New Railroad Will Give
Arizona a Fine Seaport.
A report comes from Tucson
that surveying parties are now
in the field running a line from
Ajo to the Gulf of California,
says the Benson Press.
The plan, it is said, contem .
plates the extension of the Tuc
son, Cornelia and Gila Bend
railroad not only from Ajo to a
port on the Gulf, but to build
flie line from Tucson to Ajo as
originally projected connecting
with the El Paso & Southwest
ern system at Tucson, giving all
the great mines of southern Ari
zona water route to the eastern
seaboard.
This action comes closely on
the eve of announcement of a
large increase in freight rates
on copper matte from Arizona to
the east.
It will be a little less than 200
miles from Tucson to Port Lo
bos, on the Gulf of California,
by way of Ajo.
When the Tucson, Cornelia &
Gila Bend railroad was built
from Gila to Ajo, Captain John
C. Greenway, general manager
of the New Cornelia, stated that
the line from Gila was only tern
porary and that the main line
would eventually be built from
Tucson to Ajo, a distance of 146
miles by the company survey.
The name of the road indicates
the intention to build from Tuc
son.
Walter Douglas, general man
ager of Phelps-Dodge and Com
pany, has recently been in the
southwest. It is known that he
has always been looking toward
an outlet on the gulf.
The Pheips-Dodge interests
have also incorporated the Tuc
son. Phoenix and Tidewater rail
road and may decide 'to connect
up with the Ajo and the Gulf
road by this route which would
catch the great mines at Ray
and Superior and connect up
with James S. Douglas' propos
ed north and south road at Mesa,
giving the Jerome mines an out
let to the sea.
It has long been the dream of
the great copper producers of
the state to get an outlet to the
sea on the Gulf of California.
Conditions in Mexico and the
world war stood in the way, but
with the prospect of the Mexi
can situation and peace in sight,
the first step toward a line to
the gulf is being taken.
Eastern Man Takes Hosey Mine.
M. Hoppenyan, a capitalist of
Duluth, Minn., arrived in bhe
district this week and negotia
tions are now under way which
will no doubt result in this gen
tleman taking over the Hosey
property, now owned by Neil
and John McDonald. P. A. Ken
nedy, mining engineer of Duluth,
is associated with Mr. Hoppen
yan. and it is stated that Mr.
Kennedy's examination .and re
port on the Hosey, made some
months ago, resulted in this well
known property changing hands.
The Hosey is at present equip
ped with all machinery neces
sary for development, and it is
stated the first work to be done
will bs the sinking of a 300 foot
shaft on the property.
Those who are familiar with
the history of this property have
jjo hesitancy in predicting that
with the completion of the con
templated work it will develop
into a mine of considerable mag
nitude. The Hosey is located in the
Santa Rita mountains, about one
and one-half miles west of the
American Boy mine. More than
5000 tons of ore have been ship
ped from this property since it
was first opened up, the prin
cipal values being in copper and
silver, about one ounce of the
white metal to one per cent of
copper being the average run of
the ore. Patagonian.
In Memory of Frank Luke. Jr.
At a meeting of the Phoenix
Chamber of Commerce, recently
it was decided to establish near
Phoenix in memory of Frank
Luke, Jr., a hangar or landing
place for airplanes and military
balloons.

MILTONITE DOES THE WORK
Miltonite. the scientific punc
ture preventive for automobile
and motorcycle tires, is manu
factured right here in Nojrales
by the Miltonite Tire Accessory
Company, the articles of incor
poration of which are being: pub
lished in Tiirc Border Vidette.
The incorporators of the com
pany are Chas. Milton. W. W.
Parbee and Charles 11. Gray, all
of Noptales, where the company
manufactures and distributes its
wonderful product.
"Miltonite ends all tire trouble
caused by punctures and slow
leaks and reduces the chances
of a blow out to a minimum,"
says Charles Milton, the foi tun
ate "inventor" of Miltonite, who
is now making Nogales his home
By its ability to stop all loss
of air, by closing the pores of
the inner tube, it keens the air
pressure where it should be, and
gives, according to Mr. Milton,
100 per cent more miles on tires,
for the reason that under infla
tion is the cause of fully GO per
cent of all blow outs and rim
cuts.
There is no way of telling how
much air pressure you have
without the use of a pressure
guage, and a tire containing GO
pounds looks and feels exactly
like one containing 80 pounds
pressure. So w hen1 a tire slovv
leaks down to ten or twenty
pounds below the prescribed
pressure, it naturally begins to
rim-cut and causes a wave in the
rubber and gives a hinging ac
tion to the side walls which ac
tion brings on excessive heat
and friction and they finally
break, thereby reducing the
mileage on the tires.
Mr. Milton says Miltonite is a
positive rubber preservative, it
will not injure the most delicate
fabric, and contains no acid or
injurious chemicals whatever.
It has been aptly stated that
the pneumatic tire is of the most
paradoxical construction in the
entire field of automobile engi
neering. It must be very re
silient yet withstand punishment
worthy of armor plate. Correct
application and proper treatment
of tires are all necessary to ob
tain the best results. Yet the
simple matter of inflation is the
most important point in the care
and use of tires and tubes. The
resiliency and long wearing
qualities of a tire depend as
much on proper inflation as they
do upon the rubber and fabric.
In an under inflated tire the
heat from the increased action
of the side walls soften the rub
ber cement of adhesiveness be
tween the fabric layers and a
certain amount of devulcaniza
tion takes place.
Miltonite will, says Mr. Mil
ton, keep the inflation up and
will last ideflnitely, as it cannot
evaporate. It will stay in the
tube until the tire is worn out.
L. U. Morris, general superin
tendent of the El Paso & South
western System, in a letter to
Mr. Milton, says: "I have
had no trouble whatever with
my tires since the Miltonite was
put in the tubes on December
10. 1917. Have not had a punc
ture, although have pulled sev
eral nails and tacks out of these
tires that I am positive would
have caused punctures if Milton
ite had not been in the tubes.
I am well satisfied with it"
In view of the fact that Milton
ite is manufactured by Nogales
people of high standing in this
community, we take pleasure in
calling the attention of automo
bile owners to Miltonite.
The offices of the company
are in the Trust Building, corner
International street and Morley
avenue.

Health
A
Gone
Many thousands of
women suffering from
womanly trouble, have
been benefited by the use
of Cardui, the woman's
tor.ic, according to letters
we receive, similar to this
one from Mrs. Z. V. Spell,
of l!ayne, N. C. "I could
net stand on my feet, and
just suffered terribly,"
she says. "As my suf
fering was so great, and
he had tried other reme
dies, Dr. had us
get Cardui. . . I began
improving, and it cured
me. I know, and my
doctor knows, what Car
dui did for me, for my
nerves and health were
about gone."
TAKE
The Woman's Tonic
She writes further: "I
am in splendid health - . .
can do my work. I feel I
ove it to Cardui, for I was
in dreadful condition."
If you are nervous, run
down and weak, or suffer
from headache, backache,
etc., every month, try
Cardui. Thousands of
women praise this medi
cine for the good it has
done them, and many
physicians who have used
Cardui successfully with
their women patients, for
years, endorse this medi
cine. Think what it means
to be in splendid health,
like Mrs. Spell. Give
Cardui a trial.

ant's testimony, when he accus
ed the complaining witness,
Louis C. Adams, of being tha
killer of Mrs. Quishenberry. The
jurymen were unable to decide
who stabbed the unfortunate
woman, hence the verdict, after
deliberating about five hours.
