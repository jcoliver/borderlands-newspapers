That mining companies of the
state tend to reduce taxation is
evidenced by recent report of
state board of equalization. This
report shows that four-fifths of
the state's money is derived
from mines. The lowering of
the tax rate to 39 cents on $100
was made possible by increased
valuation of mines, which valua
tion is result of increased pro
ductiou. Without m'nes, and to
keep the state with many ad
vantages which it now enjoys in
educational facilities, good roads
etc., taxes would be live times
as much as at present, or about
$2 per $100.
BREED BETTER HORSES, SPE
CIALISTS ADVISE.
According to reports received
by the United States Depart
ment of agriculture, the situa
tion in the horse breeding indus
try reveals the fact that there
are many nondescript and plug
horses glutting the markets.
This condition, it is believed,
affects the horse industry in
general. The real good animals
are still commanding satisfac
tory prices, but the misfits are
being sold considerably less than
the cost of production. The
saving of additional feed bills is
said to be the motive which
prompts the producer to dispose
of this class of horses, regard
less of price. One of the con
clusions which the Department
of Agriculture draws from the
present situation is that indis
criminate breeding of horses is
an unprofitable enterprise. It
is essential, the department spe
cialists add, that farmers use
wise discrimination in selecting
the proper type of stallions with
which to mate their best mares
and thus materially aid in pro
ducing only efficient horses
which are capable of giving the
service required of them and
which consume less valuable
feed for the amount of work per
formed. Such horses have a
ready market and always bring
good prices. It is imperative
that the breeder who proposes
to compete with the domestic
and foreign demands after the
war should begin now to stock
up his stables with desirable
better bred horses.
Mohawk Mines Shipping Ore.
James Barrett, the well known
pioneer of Tombstone, principal
owner of the Mohawk mines, lo
cated in the Dragoons, near the
famous Cochise Stronghold,
started work last week on the
mine with a small force and
work of taking out ore for ship
ment is well under way.
Several samples of the ore
brought in from the mine the
latter part of the week, show
high values in gold and silver,
and there are thousands of tons
in sight, which will be shipped.
The company was recently in
corporated, following several
years' liligation and Mr. Barrett
and his associates intend to
prosecute development work us
quick as possible so that the
mine will be placed on the pro
ducing basis. Several ship
ments are to be made at once,
following which machinery is to
be erected and a larger force
put to work. Prospector.

WHEAT BREAD NOV.
In compliance with an order
recently issued by the United
States food administration in
structions have been sent to all
county and deputy county food
administrators in Arizona to im
mediately notify the grocery
and bakery trades that all regu
lations regarding the use of sub
stitutes wich wheat flour are to
be discontinued. The grain cor
poration of the food administra
tion is formulating plans for the
purchase of surplus stocks of
substitutes in the hands of the
dealers.
This means that Arizona for
the first time in nearly a year,
has been placed on an all-wheat
diet. During the time millions
of pounds have been saved for
war export. This was accomp
lished through the hearty co
operation of housewives, dealers
and farmers. The latter re
sponded to an appaal for increas
ed wheat production with an
acreage of 20 percent over nor
mal. Arizona merchants displayed
whole hearted loyalty in the
matter of selling flour with an
equal quantity of substitutes
when the famous fifty fifty rule
was in effect, and with cne ac
cord the housewives of the state
bent to the task of feeding their
families with food, the use of
which was extremely difficult
because of its being untried.
Through the further co opera
tion of Arizona mills, Arizona
was enabled to ship 3,000,000
pounds of flour to Galveston,
from which port it was taken to
France to feed the starving pop
ulation of that war stricken
land. Other millions of pounds
of flour were diverted to the
same use through the action of
the grain division in creating an
embargo which prevented the
shipment of flour into the state.
ARIZONA HIT BY DROUTH.
Harry Turner, genaral live
stock agent for the Southern
Pacific lines, who travels over
the country extensively, says
Arizona has been hard hit by
the drouth the past few months.
He has not seen but one favora
ble spot over the territory where
he has been, which is in the
Santa Cruz valley between Tuc
son and Nogales.
Around Wilcox the cattlemen
have been shipping out to other
points and to the market. The
Diamond A people have sent
cattle to Eagle, New Mexico, to
pasture and a lot of them to
California. Johnson & Cook
have sent some to California
and to market and cattlemen
generally have been sending
cows, calves and stock of all
kinds to the canner market.

Frank Turner Secures Sonora Mines
F. W. Turner came in this
morning from old Mexico, where
he is interested in a big gold
mining proposition, says the
Tempe Daily News. Conditions
in Mexicon are becoming settled
and the next few years are go

lines of industry. A splendid
field for profitable investment
will be presented in the re open
ing of rich mines which have
been tied up by the revolutions
of the past few years.
Mr. Turner has securud the
handling of a famous gold prop
erty in the state of Souora,
which he expects to begin ope
rating within the next few
months. This property was a
rich gold producer up until the
war broke out and paralyzed
every industry in that section of
the Mexican republic.

Attention, Mexican Importers.
In view of the increasing scar
city of many commodities of
prime importance and necessity
to the United States, and which
at the same time this Govern
merit desires to share with Mex
ico, it has become necessary for
the War Trade Board to allot
such commodities for export to
Mexico, in order to equalize the
distribution throughout the neigh
boring Republic in an equitable
and orderly manner consistent
with the maximum amount of
such commodities as can be
spared.
Prospective importers in Mex
ico will facilitate the granting of
license for export by the War
Trade Board by .resenting co
pies of their orders for supplies
in triplicate to the nearest Am
erican consular officer, who will
visae such orders and retain one
copy for his file, returning the
original and one copy to the ap
plicant. The importer should
forward both vised orders to the
prospective exporters in the Un
ited States, with instructions to
attach the original vised order
to his application to the War
Trade Board at Washington, D.
C, and thereafter, in filing ap
plications for licenses to export
commodities specified on such
order, refer to the order by the
consulate stamp serial number,
which will be affixed to the or
der and also the consular ad
dress, as "Mazatlan, Serial No.
4762."
In cases where American con
sular officers are not easily ac
cessible to the prospective im
porter, a statement to that effect
should be attached to the order,
giving name of the nearest place
where a consular officer is sta
tioned. The "Peace Party" held last
Wednesday evening at the home
of Mrs. Ada Jones, on Nob Hill,
was a most delightful affair.
Mrs. Jones' son Charley, is with
the colors in France. He is a
bugler in the field artillery regiment.

NEW PASSPORT REGULATIONS.
Vice Consul Chas. Doheity,
who is acting as American con
sul in the absence cf Consul E.
M. Law ton, who is in the City
of Mexico at present, having
gone there from Washington, D.
C, states that the consulate is
in receipt of instructions from
the State Department relaxing
very greatly the regulations
with regard to passports, says
the Oasis.
Vice Consul Doherty states
that the new regulations will
permit those coining from the
south who have valid passports,
properly vised by the proper
officials, to cross without being
detained at the border, but can
pass light along, in either di
rection. But new passports will
have to await the usual fourteen
days before receiving the con
sular vise. The object of that
ruling is to give the consulate
sufficient time to investigate, the
holder of a passport, and de
termine whether he be a proper
person to have one.
Mr. Doherty states farther
that the aim of the state depart
ment is to facilitate commercial
intercourse between the people
of Mexico and the United States,
and that he considers it the aim
of all other departments of the
Washington government. He
opines that the department of
commerce and the department of
labor, have the same instruc
tious, and he looks to a general
relaxation of the drastic regu
lations which have prevailed.

The President of the United
States has, in accordance with
the National custom, designated
the twenty eighth day of No
vember .as a day of thanksgiving
and prayer.
As the President has pointed
out, never in this generation has
the day been so really signifi
cant. This Nation entered up
on its great task with all the
courage of a solemn purpose.
None of us dared to hope for
such a speedy termination of our
task. In every home that has
the Service Flag, whether its
star be one of blue or gold.
Thanksgiving will have a mean
ing that it never possessed be
fore. We approach this Thanks
giving Day safe in the know
ledge that the greatest gifts of
God, Liberty and Justice, still
pervail on earth.
Therefore, I, Geo. W. P. Hunt,
Governor of the Stats of Ari
zona, do proclaim Thursday, No
vember twenty-eighth, nineteen
eighteen, Thanksgiving Day in
the- State of Arizona, and ask
that the day be observed as a
holiday in accordance with our
national traditions.
In Witness Whereof, I have
hereunto set my hand and caus
ed the Great Seal of the State of
Arizona to be affixed.

Last evening the Nogales Daily

nouncing the resignation of Wil
liam McAdoo, as secretary of
the treasury and director gen
eral of railroads. His resigna
tion to take effect on confirma
tion by the senate of his succes
sor or successors. The letter
of resignation is dated Nov. 14
and the President's letter of ac
ceptance is dated Nov. 21.
Mr. McAdoo says inadequate
compensation as secretary of the
treasury, and his desire for rest
and to recover his personal for
tune, is the cause for his resign
ation which was tendered as
soon as peace was assured. He
may, after a well-earned rest,
resume the practice of law in
New York.
Mr. McAdoo denied that he
would be one of President Wil
son's party to Europe.

About
Gone
Many thousands of
women suffering from
womanly trouble, have
been benefited by the use
of Cafdui, the woman's
tonic, according to letters
we receive, similar to thi3
one from Mrs. Z . V . Spell ,
of Hayne, N. C. "I could
net stand on my feet, and
just suffered terribly,"
she savs. "As my suf
fering was so great, and
had tried other reme-
dies. Dr.
get Cardui.
had us
. I began
improving, and it cured
me. I know, ana my
doctor knows, wh2t Car
dui did for me, for my
nerves and health were
about gone."
TAKE
The Woman's Tonic
She writes further: " I
am in splendid health . . .
can do my work. I feel I
owe it to Cardui, for I was
in dreadful condition."
If you are nervous, run
down and weak, or surfer
from headache, backache,
etc., every month, try
Cardui. Thousands of
women praise this medi
cine for the good it has
done them, and many
physicians who have used
Cardui successfully with
their women patients, for
years, endorse this medi
cine. Think what it means
to be in splendid health,
like Mrs. Spe!l. Give
Cardui a trial.
