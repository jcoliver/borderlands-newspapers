The Spirit of Friendship.
This store looks upon its patrons not
merely as customers but as friends.
People purchase here because they
have friendly feeling for this store.
The cause which develops this friendly
feeling, may differ, in fact, they are
sure to differ. One's friendship for
the store is tbe result of finding good
valaes; another's is the result of effi
cient service and courteous treatment,
and so on.
Naturally this friendshiply feeling on
the part of our patrons is reciprocated
on our part. And this spirit of mutual
friendship is an impetus for greater
service and an incentive to ever-increasing
endeavor to make this store
a place where every visitor will feel
perfectly at home.

Captain Bain Morrison, a weal
thy resident of Lexington, Ky.,
was found by A. P. Simpson of
El Paso and Mayor E W. Evans
of New Orleans, La., in Cajon
Capula in the Sierra Madre
mountains in Sonora, Mexico, 60
miles east of Douglas, after he
had been lost for more than two
days from a party of capitalists
with whom he was cruising a

Arizona will have a tremen
dous stock of high explosives,
f efforts instituted today by

plication to the war department,
through Arizona's representa

The flourishing condition of
Arizona banks is revealed in a
statement issued by J. L. Boyce,
state superintendent of banks.
based on reports from state and
national banks as at tbe close of
business, November 17th, 1919.
According to the figures sub
mitted Arizona state and nation
al banks have total resources
amounting to more than $94,000,-
000 on an investment of a little
over $9,000,000.
Predicting that reports will
show the value of crops in Ari
zona for the past year to be
$45,000,000, L. M. Harrison.
field agent of the bureau of croD
estimates, yesterday declared
that the figures would approxi
mate an appreciable amount of
the $42,267,000 of last year. Ten
years ago the crop value for the
state was $5,496,872, according
to the statistics, making an al
most $40,000,000 gain during
that period.
Road Race at Next Fair Not Expected
Three fatalities in the course
of the El Paso to Phoenix road
race early in November have
caused a chorus of disapproval
to be voiced along the route of
the proposed annual classic
when suggestion has been made
that another race be staged next
year, says tne lomostone f ros-
pector.
Local sentiment has been easy
to gather, as at the time of hold
ing tne race, as news oi tne
fatalities began coming in ex
pressions of disapprobation were
beard frequently. El Paso also
ha expressed disapproval. The
El Paso Times said:
"No road race between El Pa
so and Phoenix will be held in
1920 if directors of the automo
tive trades and highway depart
ment of the chamber of com
merce adhere to opinion express
ed at a meeting held Wednesday
afternoon at the office of R. J.
Pritchard, head of the depart
ment. "Opposition to holding a race
the coming season was based on
the three fatalities in the event
this year. Tbe opinion seemed
to be unanimous among the
directors."
CAPT. MIX TO ACT AS CHAIRMAN
Phnenii Clant. T . W TVTi y rf
Nogales, has accepted the chair
manship of the committee on ar
rangements for the presentation
of the $10,000' silver service to
the battleship Arizona. Decem
ber 27 has been set as the ten
tative date for tbe ceremonies.
Governor Campbell has wired
Secretary of the Navy Daniels
asking if this date will be satis
factory to tbe navy officials, and
as soon as word is received ar
rangements will go ahead.
Capt. Mix will select his own
committeemen and these will be
officially appointed by the gov
ernor to go to New York and
make the presentation on behalf
of the state.
WILL PROSECUTE PROFITEEKS
Attorney General Wiley E.
Jones has announced that he is
preparing to send to county at
torneys throughout the state
specific instructions on how to
proceed with prosecutions of
profiteers under the federal sta
tute as recently amended. He
said the instructions would con
tain a detailed list of food and
other necessities under the con
templation of the law and would
impress on county attorneys that
all violators, under the amended
act, would be liable to two years'
imprisonment or $5000 fine or
both fine and imprisonment.
The food control act, recently
amended is sweeping in its pro
visions, Attorney General Jones
explains. It embraces the fol
lowing in the list of "necessi
ties:" Pood, feeds, wearing ap
parel, containers primarily de
signed or intended for contain
ing foods, feeds, wearing ap
parel, fertilizers, fuel, including
fuel oil and natural gas and fer
tilizers and fertilizer ingredients,
tools, utensils, implements, ma
chinery and equipment required
for the actual production of
foods, feeds and fuel.
The amendment also prevents
"either locally or generally
boarding, monopolizing or spe
culating in such necessities."
VALUE OF THIS YEAR'S CROPS
The value of crops grown in
the United States in 1919 was
nearly three times more than
tbe average annual value in the
five years preceding the war,
Secretary of Agriculture Hous
ton announces. On the basis of
prices that have recently pre
vailed, he says, the total value
of this year's crops of all kinds
is estimated at $15,873,000,000,
compared with $14,222,000,000 in
1918, and $13,479,000,000 in 1917.
The average annual value of
crops in the period from 1910 to
1914 was $5,829,000,000.
These values, Secretary Hous
ton explains, represent gross
production and not net gains to
the producers. The value of
live stock on the farms in 1919
was $8,830,000,000, which was
$546,000,000 more than that for
1918, $1,094,000,000 greater than
for 1917, and $3,512,000,000 above
that for 1914.
Forecasts on meat production
in the United States for 1919,
the Secretary says, indicate that
the record figure of last year
20,250,000,000 pounds will be
exceeded. This year's total is
expected to be 21,000,000,000
pounds, of which pork will re
present 12,900,000,000 pounds.
MAY FIX TEACHERS' SALARIES
C. O. Case, state superinten
dent of public instruction, (Dec.
lltb) said he would within a few
days, call upon Attorney Gen
eral Jones for an opinion whe
ther boards of supervisors are
bound by maximum or minimum
salaries to be paid to school
teachers.
Superintendent Case has been
insistent that some means must
be found of raising teachers'
salaries, pointing to many vac
ancies already existing, espe
cially in rural schools.
The attorney general said his
opinion, if asked, would be that
boards of supervisors were not
bound by maximums or mini
mums, but were allowed the ex
ercise of their own discretion in
fixing salaries.
FREE SERVICES OFFERE.D
In the belief that there are
many Arizonans who are entitled
to compensation for the loss of
relatives slain in the war, who
have not put in their claims for
such, the insurance department
of the Arizona corporation com
mission is co operating with the
bureau of war risks in seeing
that such claims are paid, and is
also offering to all leturned ser
vice men all possible assistance
in retaining, reinstating or con
verting their government insur
ance. Tbe services of the state in
surance department are at tbe
disposal of any resident of Ari
zona desiring information along
this line.

the taxes levied by the Board of
auoervisors upon iue mc r .uai
Grant, for the years 1913, 1914,
1915 and 1916, says the Oasis.
Litigation involving the valid
ity of these taxes has been pend
ing for approximately two years.
The case was tried in the Su
perior Court of this county be
fore Judge Pattee, the county
being represented by Mr. Hardy,
and the owners of the Float be
ing represented by Messrs Kin

the county could in no event, tax

government survey thereof was
not filed until after the taxes
were levied for those years,

KEEPING UP THEIR INSURANCE
The Government, through the
Bureau of War Risk Insurance,
wrote approximately $40,000,
000,000 of iusurance upon the
lives of mere than 4,500,000 ser
vice men and women. This is a
larger volume of insurance than
is in force in the old line insur
ance companies in the United
States. Approximately 90 per
cent of thu men in active service
during tlin war were protected
by War Risk Insurance, and the
average protection was $8,700.
While the men were in the
service it, was easy to collect the
insurance premiums by deduct
ing the amount due each month
from their pay. Now the men
have to look after the payment
of tbeir own premiums, and the
situation is further complicated
by reason of the fact that the
addresses of hundreds of thous
ands of them are no longer
known to the Bureau of War
Risk Insurance. Colonel R. G.
-Cholmeley Jones, Director of the
Bureau, does not consider it sur
prising that .so many former ser
vice men have not continued to
make regular monthly payment
of their War Risk Insurance pre
miums. He says:
"In the first place, very few
of them realize that the Govern
ment insurance, as well as com
pensation and allotments and
allowances, is said by the Treas
ury Department through the
Bureau of War Risk Insurance;
neither do they realize that after
their discharge from active ser
vice their checks or money or
ders lor insurance premiums
should be made payable to "Tha
Treasurer of the United States,"
and sent to Premium Receipt
Section, Bureau of War Risk
Insurance, Washington, D. C.
Again, it will take considerable
time for the former service men
to get on their feet and get their
bearings, even though they are
healthy and strong.
"Many have not yet decided
into what business activity they
will enter or even where they
intend ultimately to live. Lots
of boys from the farms will lo
cate in cities and many city boys
may move into the country. In
the interim isn't it too much to
expect that the matter of pay
ment of their life insurance pre
miums should become pai amount
in their minds?
"They must be given time to
adjust themselves to new condi
tions; but we don't want them to
give up their insurance, and un
der a recent ruling every one of
them who has been insured, and
who is in as good health as at
the time of his discharge, has
eighteen months from the time
of his discharge from the ser
vice in which to reinstate his
War Risk Insurance.
"The payment of only two
premiums for reinstatement is
now required one to cover the
month of grace during which the
man was protected, the other
the premium for the current
month of reinstatement. The
man, however, must state in his
application that he is in as good
health as when discharged or as
he was when the grace period
of his insurance expired, which
ever is the later date."
