A Chicagoan, writing to the
Chicago Tribune, after a visit to
the soldiers' hospital at Fort
Benjamin Harrison to see his
wounded son, made a pertinent
observation it would be well for
those who are trying to make
political capital out of their op
position to the Leage of Nations
on the alleged ground of Amer
icanism to bear in mind. He
wrote:
"There are about 1,000 wound
ed soldiers (in the Fort Benja
min Harrison hospital) who saw
service overseas. While there I
heard enough from the wound
ed soldiers to convince me that
any man in public life who takes
a stand against the proposed
League of Nations will most as
suredly be retired to private life.
All the wounded men with
whom I talked feel that the Pre
sident is trying to do something
for humanity. They know what
war really is, and are anxious
for universal peace.
Talk to the soldiers, more es
pecially those who have been
wounded or gassed, and they
will tell you, as they told me:
'We have had all the war we
want. We want peace.' And
that is what President Wilson
crossed the sea for, to bring
about peace international peace
peace for all people."

PRESIDENT'S TRIBUTE TO OUR
FIGHTING MEN.
In his address to the Senate
on the subject of the peace
treaty and the League of Na
tions, President Wilson spoke
eloquent words of tribute to the
American soldier's struggles,
sacrifices and achievements in
Europe. In part this topic of
his address was as follows:
"That first, never-to be for
gotten action at Chateau Thierry
had already taken place. Our
redoubtable soldiers and ma
rines had already closed the gap
the enemy had succeeded in
opening for their advance upon
Paris had already turned the
tide of battle back toward the
frontiers of France and begun
the rout that was to save Europe
and the world. Thereafter the
Germans were to be always
forced back, back; were never to
thrust successfully forward
again
"This is not the occasion upon
which to utter a eulogy of the
armies America sent to France,
but perhaps, since I am speak
ing of their mission, I may speak
also of the pride I shared with
every American who saw or
dealt with them there. They
were the sort of men America
would wish to be represented
by, the sort of men every Amer
ican would wish to claim as fel
low countrymen and comrades
in a great cause.
"They were terrible in battle,
and gentle and helpful out of it,
remembering the mothers and
the sisters, the wives and the
little children at hotqe. They
were free men under arms, not
forgetting their ideals of duty
in the midst of tasks of violence.
I am proud to have had the
privilege of being associated
with them and of calling myself
their leader ....
"What thay did made America
and all that she stood for a liv
ing reality in the thought not
only of the people of France,
but also of tens of millions of
men and women throughout all
the toiling nations of a world
standing everywhere in peril of
its freedom and of the loss of
everything it held dear, in dead
ly fear that its bonds were never
to be loosed, its hopes forever
to be mocked and disappointed."
THE NEW NATIONAL GUARD.
Final plans for the reorganiz
ation of the National Guard on
the sixteen division basis with
division areas following the same
limit as did those guard divisions
that saw service against Ger
many, have been approved by
Secretary Baker.
Major General Carter imme
diately sent notification to the
adjutant generals of the states,
of the units allotted to each state
and of the readiness of the Fed
eral government to extend re
cognition after an inspection is
made. The reorganization as
recently announced, provides for
forty-seven regiments and eigh
teen battalions of infantry; six
regiments, seventeen squadrons
and nineteen troops of cavalry;
ten regiments, twenty battalions
and ten batteries of field artil
lery, and seventy four coast ar
tillery companies, with addition
al forces of engineers, signal
corps and sanitary engineers.
The assignment to Arizona is
one squadron of cavalry aud one
regiment of field artillery.
THE TEMPE NORMAL SCHOOL.
One of the most far-reaching
effects of the great war, is the
opening of the eyes of peoples
and governments to the vital
need of more and better educa
tion of the youth. To quote
Professor Erskine of the A. E.
P. University, "Education has
become the chief concern of
statesmen. The new program
of education will discipline the
intellect and will train special
skills. It must be broad enough
to include all efforts that enlarge
the vision of the peoples, that
make them tolerant and keep
them open minded." In another
place, Prof. Erskine reminds us
that "The new world into which
we are now entering will be, it
seems, a world of experts."
Recognizing the fact of this
coming demand for a newer and
better system of education, the
Tempe Normal School of Ariz
ona has planned and arranged a
series of special courses in voca
tional training. For carrying
forward the work of these cour
ses, th.e state has provided a
building and equipment, the com
pleteness of which may be judged
by the fact that its total cost is
over $100,000. This building
with all its apparatus and ma
chinery, the most complete of its
kind in the southwest, is a pub
lic institution and is open to all
young men and young women of
Arizona, free of any tuition
charge except the general regis
tration fee of $5.00. The in
structors are all specialists in
their respective lines of work,
and a broad experience in teach
ing. Tempe Normal School
wishes to assist all those stud
ents who have some "hobby" or
special aptitude which they de
sire to develop by special train
ing, and particularly invites the
attention of high school gradu
ates who, just now, are looking
into the future.
Three types of vocational
courses are offered. The first is
a series of two year courses open
to high school graduates who
desire to prepare to become de
partmental teachers or supervis
ors of Manual Training, Home
Economics, Art, Agriculture,
Kindergarten Training or Com
mercial Subjects. These courses
should be attractive because of
the growing demand for such
teachers who command the high
er salaries.
The second group of two year
courses in the special lines of
work above mentioned are open
to high sehool graduates who do
not wish to become teachers but
who wish to devote the greater
part of their time to the voca
tional subject of their choice.
Third in order are the partial
courses offered for the benefit of
students of some degree of ma
turity whose previous prepara
tion may not qualify them for
admission to the regular courses,
but who wish to obtain special
training for self improvement in
wood working, machine shop or
machine design, or, in fact, al
most any line of vocational work
in which a class of four or five
can be organized. No special
prerequisites are required for
entrance into these courses, and
students may enter at any time.
The dormitory accommodations
for students living at a distance
are unsurpassed and expenses
are reasonable. For further par
ticulars relating to the above
courses Or other matters con
cerning the school, correspond
ence is solicited, as it is the de
sire of the management to bring
the advantages of the institution
to the attention of the students
for whom it is intended.

Six Tears Ago, Thinking She Might Die, Says Texas Lady, Bui I!ov?
She Is a Well, Strong Woman and Praises Cardui For
Her Recovery.
Royse City, Tex. Mrs. Mary Kil
man, of this place, says; "After the
birth of my little girl. . .my side com
menced to hurt me. I had to go back
to bed. We called the doctor. He
treated me. . .but I got no better. I
got worse and worse until the misery
aras unbearable. .. I was In bed for
-.hree months and suffered such agony
.hat I was just drawn up Ini a knot. . .
I told my husband if he would get
ne a bottle of Cardui I would try it . . .
I commenced taking it, however, that
evening I called my family about
oie. . . for I knew I could not last
many daj-s unltess I had a change for
the better. That was sis years ago
and I am still here and am a well,
strong woman, and I owe my life to
Cardui. I had only taken half the
bottle -whon I began to feel better. -The
misery in my side got less... I
continued right on taking the Cardui
until I had taken thiee bottles and I
did not need any more for I was well
and never felt better in my life... I
have never had any trouble from that
day to this."
Do you suffer from headache, back
ache, pains in sides, or other discom
forts, each month? Or do you feel

VACATION LAND FOR EVERYBODY
Americans everywhere are in
vited to make use of the ideal
vacation land that exists in the
national forests. Most of the
great woodlands are in the West
ern states, but some are in the
East, so that no section of the
country is too distant to share
in their benefits. The forest
service of the United States De
partment of Agriculture is en
deavoring to bring about a full
public realization of what the
forests offer.
"You will encounter no 'Keep
Out' signs on the forests," says
one of several booklets issued
by the forest service. They are
not fenced against the public,
but invite your presence and
use. The only signs you will
find are those which point you
on your way or ask your co
operation in preserving the be
auty and value of these free re
creation grounds and their re
sources. Fire arms are. not bar
red and hunting and fishing are
restricted only by the require
meats of the state game laws.
"You are welcome to all the
necessary firewood and to for
acre for your saddle and uack
animals; and, so far as possible,
the grazing of commercial stock
is regulated in such a way as to
save an accessible supply of
forage for the camper's use.
You may camp where you like
and stay as long as you please.
The forest service asks that you
look only to the proper sanita
tion of the camp and that you
be careful with fire."
Information on the forests will
be furnished to all who apply to
the forest supervisors, the dis
trict foresters, or to the forest
service at Washington, D. C.

IMPOUND SANTA CRUZ WATER.
Water to the right of us,
water to the left of us, water in
front and back of us, came the
word from the country traversed
by the washes of the Santa Ciuz
river last Tuesday, says the
Arizona Cattleman.
At midnight in Tucson the
night before the roar of the
Santa Cruz could be heard at
the city hall and before noon on
Tuesday a flood of water spread
out over a portion of this valley.
When the spirit of reclamation
takes a strong hold of our peo
pie, or private capital sees the
great opportunity in impounding
the flood waters of this river for
irristiog purposes the dream
of the late Bill Green, the cop
per magnate, will have come
true. The company he organ
ized built a reservoir and pre
pared thousands of acres of land
for irrigation but his death stop
ed further work. A few years
past the dam broke. Had the
company completed their plans
thousands upon thousands of
acres of Casa Grande land would
now be under cultivation. The
Santa Cruz is still on the job
and its flood waters can be util
ized. All that is needed is the
big money to take up the work
and the sale of Jands under the
project would soon pay for the
construction of dam and canals.
