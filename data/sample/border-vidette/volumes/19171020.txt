OCTOBER 24 LIBERTY DAY.
President Wilson Makes Earnest Plea
for Second Loan.
President Wilson has issued a
proclamation declaring Wednes
day, October 24, Liberty Day,
and calling upon the people to
make the second Liberty loan a
greater success than was the
first. All government employes,
except those whose work is ab
solutely essential to the war,
will be given a half holiday on
that day.
The president's proclamation
follows:
"By the president of the Un
ited States of America, a Pro
clamation:
"The second Liberty loan gives
the people of the United States
another opportunity to lend their
funds to their government to
sustain their country at war.
The might of he Un'ted States
is being mobilized and organized
to strike a mortal blow at auto
cracy in defense of outraged
American rights and of the cause
of liberty. Billions of dollars
are required' to arm. feed and
clothe the brave men who are
going forth to fight our coun
try's battles and to assist the
nations with whom we are mak
ing common cause against a
common foe. To subscribe to
the Liberty loan is to perform a
service of patriotism.
"Now, therefore, I, Wood row
Wilson, president of the United
States of America, do appoint
Wednesday, the 24th of October,
as Liberty Day, and urge and
advise the people to assemble in
their respective communities and
pledge to one another and to
the government that represents
them the fullest measure of fi
nancial support. On the after
noon of that day I request that
patriotic meetings be held in
every city, town and hamlet
throughout the land, under the
general direction of the secre
tary of the treasury and the im
mediate direction of the Liberty
loan committees which have
been organized by the federal
reserve banks. The people re
sponded nobly to the call of the
first Liberty loan with an over
subscription of more than 50 per
cent. Let the response to the
second loan be even greater and
let the amount be so large that
it will serve as an assurance of
unequalled support to hearten
the men who are to face the fire
of battle for us. Let the result
be so impressive and emphatic
that it will echo throughout the
empire of our enemy as an index
of what America intends to do
to bring this war to a victorious
conclusion.
"For the purpose of partici
pating in Liberty Day celebra
tion all employees of the federal
government throughout the
country, whose services can be
spared, may be excused at 12
o'clock Wednesday, the 24th of
October."
$5,000,000 for War Loan Bonds.
J. Kruttschnitt, chairman of
the Executive Committee of the
Southern Pacific Company, an
nounced October 1st, that the
Southern Pacific has subscribed
for $5,000,000 of the new 4 per
cent War Loan Bonds, and that
to enable its employees to par
ticipate in the new loan, the com
pany, upon request of any such
employee, will subscribe for any
amount of bonds desired, not ex
ceeding 25 per cent of yearly sal
ary, and will advance in month
ly installments over a period of
two years.
This company made a similar
offer to its employees with re
spect to the Liberty Loan 3A per
cent bonds (to which the com
pany itself subscribed $5,000,
000,) and at that time 19,973 em
ployees, representing 27 percent
of the total number of persons
employed, subscribed for an ag
gregate amount of $1,918,800.
Arizona's copper output for
August has been estimated at
approximately 50,000,000 pounds
as against nearly 91,000,000
pounds that might have been
expected, except for the inter
ference of the wobblies. But
the wobblies are not wobbling
so much now and almost every
body else is wearing a smile.

Arizona Supports Liberty Bond Drive.
The Arizona Council of De
fense has adopted the following
resolution, urging the people of
Arizona to purchase Liberty
Bonds:
"Whereas the best support
which the people of Arizona can
give to the thousands of young
men from this State who are
now serving their country in
various branches of the national
service is by liberal subscrip
tions to the Liberty Bonds, and
as these patriotic young men
who have gone to the froni are
offering their all to the country;
it becomes - the manifest duty of
every man and woman in the
state so blessed with prosper
ity to purchase these bonds to
the limit of their ability.
"Now therefore, be it resolv
ed that the Executive Commit
tee of the Arizona Council of
Defense appeals to the men and
women of Arizona to back up
our boys at the front not only
by liberal subscriptions to the
present issue of Liberty Bonds
a sound and profitable invest
ment but by working among
their friends and neighbors to
obtain such subscriptions, thus
giving to the men who are offer
ing their lives to their country
the support which they so justly
deserve.
RESIGNS POSITION.
Allan B. Jaynes, publisher of
the Citizen, who has been serv
ing as chairman of the publicity
committee of the Arizona Coun
cil of Defense, has tendered his
resignation to the executive com
mittee with a request that a
Phoenix man be appointed to
his place, with a view of cen
tralizing the work of the De
fense Council. Inasmuch as the
headquarters of the council have
been located in Phoenix and Mr.
Jaynes lives in Tucson he has
worked under considerable han
dicap. The executive committee
acceded to Mr. Jaynes' request
and appointed Col. James H.
McClintock chairman of the com
mittee. Col. McClintock, who is
a newspaper man of long years
experience in Arizona, will im
mediately take up the work. He
has been serving on the com
mittee, and Mr. Jaynes, whom
he succeeds, will continue to
serve as a member of the com
mittee. Arizona Cattle Growers Boost Liberty
Bonds.
The Arizona Cattle Growers'
association headed by president
L. L. Harmon, has issued a spe
cial appeal to its members to
subscribe liberally to the second
Issue of Liberty Bonds. The
circular states:
"Cowmen, now is the time to
come to your country's assist
ance; now is the time the coun
try needs your help. Loan your
country as much as you can
afford in this manner, and there
by make it possible to prosecute
the war with all the force of the
great American nation. Buy the
bonds through your banker. Do
it now. Also see that your
neighbor does the same."

THE CIRCUS IS COMING.
Mammoth Wild Animal Show Will Be
. Here Next Wednesday.
Tuesday Miss Emma C. Miller,
general press representative for
the Al. G. Barnes Big Pour
Ring Wild Animal Circus, was
hustling in NoRales, and paid
the newspaper offices a visit.
Miss Miller has been with the
big circus a number of years.
She was more enthusiastic
than ever over the big circus
billed to appear in Nogales on
Wednesday, October 24th after
noon and evening. Miss Miller
said:
"The circus, like the baseball
game, is an American institu
tiod, and is dear to the heart of
every American, be they boy,
girl, man or woman, and as an
American recreation receives the
hearty response of every true
American. The Barnes Circus
is an original and genuine wild
animal circus, two trains of
double length cars are required
to transport this mammoth edu
cational institution, ovei 100 wild
and domestic animals and 150 of
the 500 people the Barnes Circus
carries, make' up a program of
sixty-five feature acts that all
who have ever seen it and every
one concedes, is the most sensa
tional tented organization in the
world, the greatest program ever
presented under canvas.
"The confidence, respect and
admiration of the public have
been won by the Al. G. Barnes
Circus, because they have been
given, just what they were pro
mised, because the management
adheres to strict honorable busi
ness principles and are ever
mindful of the confidence, con
venience and comforts of their
patrons."
Miss Miller said: "Remember
the big free street parade at
10:30 a. m. Doors open at 1 and
7 p. m. Performances at 2 and
8 p. m."

WULFENITE.
For the benefit of those in
quiring for information in regard
to wolframite and wulfenite,
which is molybdate of lead, the
University of Arizona Bulletin
states that wulfenite is occasion
ally found with other lead ores.
In Cochise county it is nearly
always .present with silver ore,
as in Tombstone, in small quan
tities. It is found in Gila coun
ty, at Troy. In Pima county at
the old Yuma mine, fourteen
miles northwest of Tucson. In
Pinal county, at the Mammoth
mine, and Schultz. In Yavapai
county, in the Bt-adshaw moun
tains. Wulfenite is also report
ed from Castle Dome in Yuma
county. The distinguished feat
ures of wulfenite are crystals,
most commonly square and of
thin tabular habit. It sometimes
occurs in fine granular masses
with almost perfect pyramidal
cleavage. It breaks with shell
like uneven fracture, has a re
sinous and adamantine lustre.
The colors are various shades of
yellow, green and grey. Some
specimens are streaked with
white and grey. Wulfenite is
easily fusible at 2, on charcoal,
giving a metallic button. The
sodium phosphate bead is green
in reducing flame. It is readily
decomposed in hydrochloric acid
and gives a blue solution in sul
phuric acid and alcohol. As a
secondary mineral it is often
found associated with vanadi
nite. Wulfenite and molybdenite
are sources of molybdenum.
