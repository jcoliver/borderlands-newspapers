Twin Ruttes, Silver Bell and
surrounding mineral country in

much more attention than they
have been receiving. Both Twin

about a greatly increased degree
of esteem for their worth. The
management of these producers
have earned much credit.

The lead and silver production
of the state will show a material
ly higher value in 1917 than
1916 if the gain in market prices
for these metals continues, as
there is now every prospect it
will. Lead in the first five
months of the year averaged
8.95, as compared with 6. SO in
19113. Present quotations are
around 10.50 "as given by the
Engineering & Mining Journal.
Silver averaged 65.7 in 1916, and
close to 75 cents for the first
five months of this year, a gain
of nine cents the ounce. In the
old Gunsight district and about
Prescott, Kingman and Chloride
there has been the largest in
crease in the development and
mining of these metals, if the
activities of some of the big cop
per producing mines in going
after reserve ore bodies carrying
high silver-lead contents along
with copper are left aside. Both
silver and lead are claiming in
creased attention throuhout the
mineral districts of the state,
however, and output promises
to be much increased before the
end of the year.

Working with him at the time

W. F. Christmann has been
appointed United States com
missioner.resident at Sonoita, by
Judge Sawtelle. After putting
forth an earnest effort the So
noita and Elgin section has been
successful in securing recogni
tion in this important matter,
which means so much ' to the
convenience of its many home
steaders. Heretofore it has been
necessary to come to Tucson or
go to Nogales to make final
proof or initiate a tiling, involv
ing a great loss of time and ex
pense, whereas in the future
land office matters can be at
tended to at home.
i After several months' contin
uous drilling operations, attend
ed with the usual ups and downs
incidental to this line of work,
water was struck in the well of
Roland C. Laritnore at Sonoita,
a depth of 410 feet. The flow is
a very strong one and the water
level is gradually raising This
is the first hole which has ever
been put down to water in the
Mesa section, which has here
tofore been regarded with some
doubt, and proves the possibili
ties of developing the under
ground supply. Air. Larimore
is now installing a twelve-foot
windmill and large concrete re
servoir to insure the supply for
over one hundred head of stock.

Manganese prospecting and
development, which has made
remarkable strides in Arizona
during the last year, is coming
in for much encouragement from
the government. Electric fur
naces have in the last two years
overcome many of the problems
that formerly confronted suc
cessful manganese handling.
Arizona resourcefulness and
scientific attainment are now be
ing brought to bear aloug this
line and it is possible that be
fore long there will be manganese
furnaces in operation within the
state. In sucti event its produc
tion of the metal will greatly in
crease. A great deal of the ore
is extant in the state and with
the coming of assurances of a
profitable future market through
the establishment of home reduc
tion works the mining of this
metal will greatly increase.
Former Sheriff McKnight has
been appointed livestock sani
tary inspector for this county, by
Governor Campbell, succeeding
Harry Saxon. There are sever
al "fat" little jobs connected with
the handling of cattle in this
state, and the new Governor is
letting the axe fall without
mercy on the Democratic ap
pointees. Theie is no fault to
lind with this it's the way the
game is played. Only some peo
ple are always kicking about
"politics." Another Santa Cruz
county man who will probably
snare off a job connected with
the inspection of cattle is Eou
Stevens, for many years a depu

these two men, "Mac" and Lou,
are the chief defenders of the

BE A REAL AMERICAN.
Contribute to the War Fund, of the
Red Cross.
The following article by John
B. Miller, appointed by Presi
dent Wilson to take charge of
i the American Red Cross War
Fund in the territory west of
the Mississippi, is published up
on request of D. M. Reynolds,
Director of Publicity: s
If you are a real American
you must contribute to the War
Fund of the Red Cross during
the week of June 18th to 25th,
whether you believe yourself
able or not. If you are a real
American it is not a question of
giving from your surplus you
must give and keep on giving
until you can give no more, and,
even after that, you must keep
on.
We are at war, but we do not
realize what war is, and, if the
Red Cross is able to do its full
duty, we will never know what
war can be.
Do you know what the Red
Cross does? Some day, "Some
where in France"- when our
soldiers are in the trenches, a
line of American boys will leap
over the top of their trenches,
slip tnrougii tne baroea wire,
and, in face of high explosive
shells, gas, liquid fire, shrapnel,
grenades, machine gun and rifle
tire, face the barbed wire in
front of enemy trenches for the
bare chance of meeting bayonet
with bayonet, other boys no
more to blame for this war than
they are.
You know what the loss will
be. You know that after Ypres
the Princess Pats had only 1127
men alive out of the 689 that
saw the sum come up that day.
What of the fallen ? If the Red
Cross is ready, the Ambulance
Corps of the fighting regiments
will carry the wounded back
through the communicating
trenches to the dressing station.
Here Red Cross surgeons, under
the direct control of the United
States Medical Department will
give first aid. The wounded will
be turned over to Red Cross am
bulances, and carried back to
the Red Cross field Hospital for
immediate attention. From the
Red Cross Field Hosnital, Red
Cress ambulances. Red Cross
trains and, in France, eyen Red
Cross canal boats will carry the
men back to the Red Cross base
hospitals. If the wound is not
fatal a Red Cross convalescing
station will take care of the
soldier till he is ready to go back
to the front. If the man is dis
abled a Red Cross steamer will
bring him back to America, and
the Red Cross receiving station
here will care for him, send him
home and on top of that look
after his family after he is
wounded just as it will have
looked after his family all the
time he has been away.
Do you know what this means?
In the old days before the Red
Cross came, 600 soldiers died
out of every 1000 wounded.
Today under proper conditions
the percentage is not over 5 per
cent.
If your boy was wounded eve
ry dollar you have in the world
would go willingly to put him
in Red Cross hands. Sixty
thousand Los Angeles boys re
gistered June 5th for the draft.
How many of them will require
Red Cross aid within the next
years ?
The Red Cross in not a hit or
miss organization, grabbing a
dollar here and a dollar there
and wasting the money. It is
one of the five offensive and de
fensive arms of every civilized
government on the face of the
earth.
Every dollar that comes in is
spent by the best business men
in America for supplies and
material designated by the Me
dical Department of the United
States Army the Department
that has stamped out yellow
fever as well as many other
great national scourages.
Ex-President Taft is the
Chairman of the Red Cross. A
partner in the house of Morgan
is its Financial Chief. Its ac
counts are audited by the War
Department. Its existence and
operations are directed under
special Acts of Congress, and
President Wilson himself, by
executive order, established the
Executive Committee under
which the Rd Cross is now be
ing managed.
The Red Cross is therefore a
oart of the fighting forces of the
Government and must be sup
ported as such. This support
will be easy enough to get-when
that support is too late. Let tha
toll of one battle mount, as it
often does, to 25,000 men or more!
With the hospital overcrowded
and our own men dying for
want of attention, the response
to the Red Cross call will roll in
fast enough but then it will be
too late.
Don't you be one of those to
hold back until that time. Don't
be a slacker. You inevitably
will contribute.! Why not now?
MANAGERS FRIENDLY TO LABOR.
The cordial relations that ex
ist between labor and capital in
some directions at least in Mexi
co, are shown by tne recent hold
ing of a Congress of Railway
Employes in Mexico City for tha
purpose of discussing and ar
ranging many matters of im
portance, including wages, hours
of labor, etc. This congress
was called at the direct request
of the managers of the lines,
and tha proceedings are said to
have been harmonious and sat
isfactory to both sides. It is
probably the first instance of
the kind in the world's history,
and is an apt illustration of the
changed conditions for the better
that have attended the triumph
of the revolution. Messenger.

The following Resolution was

prosecution of the war, and
Whereas, It has been the

the welfare of our bojs at the
front;
Now, Therefore, Be It Re
solved, That Nogales celebrate
the -Fourth of July 1n a truly
patriotic manner by parade,
speeches and music and the En
tertainment Committee is re
quested to arrange for the carry
ing out of such a program but
the usual display of fireworks,
amusements, etc., that require
an expenditure of money and
extraordinary work by com
mittees, be eliminated.

Health
About
Gone
Many thousands of
women suffering from
womanly trouble, have
been benefited by the use
of Cardui, the woman's
tonic, according to letters
we receive, similar to this
One from Mrs. Z. V. Spell,
of Hayne, N. C. "I could
not stand on my feet, and
just suffered terribly,"
she says. "As my suf
fering was so great, and
he had tried other reme
dies, Dr. had us
get Cardui. . . I began
improving, and it cured
me. 1 know, and my
doctor knows, what Car
dui did for me, for my
nerves and health were
about gone."
TAKE
CARDl
The Woman's Tonic
She writes iurther: " I
am in splendid health . . .
can do my work. I feel I
ove it to Cardui, for I was
in dreadful condition."
If you are nervous, run
down and weak, or suffer
from headache, backache,
etc., ewry month, try
Cardui. Thousands of
women praise this medi
cine for the good it has
done thein, and many
physicians who have used
Cardui successfully witti
their women patients, for
years, endorse this medi
cine. Think what it means
to be in splendid health,
like Mrs. Spell. Give
Cardui a trial.

of cooking" with Pearl Oil.

Low boiling points do it the first links in a
continuous chain of boiling points. Low boiling
points for easy starting, medium boiling points
for quick and smooth acceleration, and high
boiling points for power and mileage.
Red Crown is a straight - distilled gasoline.
Hence there's a continuous chain of boiling
points, gradually rising from low to high.
Mixtures cannot have a continuous chain of
boiling points. That's why mixtures cannot be
as good motor fuel as pure straight-run gaso
line. And that's also why the gravity test for
gasoline is worthless gravity tells nothing at
all about boiling points, the only real test of
gasoline quality.
To make certain of getting real gasoline, and
not a mixture, fill with
