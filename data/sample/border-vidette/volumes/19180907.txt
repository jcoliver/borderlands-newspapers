whether you have a large fami

you work on trie farm or in the

you are, unless you are in ser

If you shirk your duty not on

in danger. For as Chief of Staff
Peyton C. March says, "The
only way that Germany can be
whipped is by America going
into this war with her whole
strength !''
The first draft obtained almost
three million men. Two million
more are needed. "With an Am
erican Army of 4,000.000 men"
says General March, "we can
go through the German
wherever we please."
To get the rest of this
million, all men between
ages noted above must register.
There are about thirteen mil
lions of these. But the draft
boards will discard the unfit,
those with large families and
those in war industries and
leave a gigantic army of deter
mined men who are ready to rid
the world of the menace of the
Huns.
The Government is very busy
it may be days before the re
gistration can be checked up and
it be determined whether or not
you have registered. Don't wait
for this "checking up" act as a
man should, and register on

MINES AND MINERS.
PatConloy and associates have
taken a lease on the Sunlight
group of copper claims, owned
by A. S. Henderson and Jim
Keating.
The Morning Glory has been
adding additional men to its pay
roll this week. This old pro
ducer has 50,000 tons of low
grade ore in a sight, which is
rather complex, but a new pro
cess of treating it is being tried
out, which, if successful, will
mean a big thing for the lesees,
E. R. Shaw and associates.
Messrs. Sullivan, Dawson and
Harrington have taken a lease
on the Exposed Reef mine, near
Patagonia, in Alum Gulch, and
have a carload of machinery al
ready on the ground, which will
be installed as soon as possible.
The prospect has considerable
work done and fine samples of
ore have been taken from the
property.
The Consolidated Arizona Cop
per tJo., at Mowry, has just re
ceived an engine and hoist, and
other machinery has been or
dered and shipped, which will
arrive in the course of time.
The shaft on the property is now
down 100 feet, and 15 men are
at work and others will be put
on the job as soon as places can
be made for them.
W. J. Mitchel was in Tucson
recently making tests of man
ganese ore from the Mowry
mine, of which he is superinten
dent. Mr. Mitchel says the body
of manganese ore on the com
pany's property is immense, but
mostly low grade, and a concen
trator is to be erected so the ore
can be brought up to a higher
degree of fineness. The ma
chinery has been ordered, and
will be installed immediately up
on its arrival, which is expected
momentarily'. Patagonian.
Hon. A. C. Baker, candidate
for Judge of the Supreme Court
of Arizona, was a visitor at
Tempe today. All but the new
comers in this section know
Judge Baker, most of them per
sonally, and he is held in the
highest esteem . That his friends
will gladly rally to his support
at the primaries is a foregone
conclusion, and a just tribute to
his ability and high standing.

FOR GOVERNOR
Democratic Primaries September 10,
Dear Fellow Citizens:
I have conducted this cam
paign in a clean way. I have
made no combinations nor have
I made any promise. I have
spent no one's money but my
own. No one has withdrawn in
my favor nor do I want anyone
to do so.
Either as Chairman of the
Board of Supervisors of Apache
County or as Democratic Nation
al Committeeman, or as Member
of the Constitutional Convention,
or as Senator in two state legis
latures, I have enforced the local
option law, suppressed gambl
ing, striven for clean politics
and progressive principles, in
troduced, voted and worked for
Women's Suffrage and Prohibi
tion before they were popular
issues; (introduced and fought
for the Irrigation District Bill);
voted for minimum wage for
women, voted and fought against
and helped to kill the special
mine tax law, the greatest vie
tory ever won for you in this
state, so you can surely see why
special interests are so hitter
and intensely trying to prejudice
and mislead the public in order
to regain their ground. Isn't
this a sad thing when it is so
necessary to avoid prejudice and
promote harmony in order to
supply our boys "over there?"
My detination of Patriotism is
unselfish and sacrificing service
for our country and public, which
I have tried to do, and study all
my life. God knows, during this
terrible crisis, I am willing to
suffer abuse, embarrassment and
death to arouse the interest in
government, and its manage
ment, to win this war quickly.
Born on the Frontier of Arizona,
I have suffered many Pioneer
hardships in its farming and
irrigation development. So I am
determined in her getting justice
and doing her part.
Do you know that nearly every
one of the large Democratic
daily newspapers in the state
are either owned outright or are
influenced by the copper com
panies of the state? Every one
of these papeis have become
vicious in their opposition to
me that I am the only candi
date for governor they are op
posing, even though I have no
ill feeling for them, and my rec
ord and acts show I have been
unquestionably fair to them.
They are also opposed to me for
the further reason that a.s Sena
tor I fought the tremendous ef
forts of the mining companies to
secure a special mine tax law.
Because mines are now assessed
I for $491,719,999 instead of $140,.
02,395, the assessment under
their own law which I helped to
kill on this account the state
rate is lower this year than ever
before. Because Santa Cruz
county now pays 2.0 per cent of
state tax against 11.2 per cent
which it paid when the Consti
tutional Convention met, and
where as a member I helped to
break the power of these inter
ests that had dominated the ter
ritory for a generation. Because
I voted for the law that gives
to Santa Cruz county out of the
state school fund many thous
ands of dollars more than it
pays into that fund, the big in
terests took that law into the
courts and tried to beat it. Be
CO I J " bl Ft
1918.
cause'they object to paying this
money into the school fund not
withstanding last year they
made more than $73, 000,000 out
of the natural resources of this
state, and shipped this fabulous
wealth away to enrich other
states and countries. Because,
generally, as a private citizen
and as a public official, I have
insisted that while this tremend
ous wealth was leaving the state
in a steady stream, it should
pay the same tax that you and I
pay. And all of this noise about
Wobblies and strutting patriot
ism by the kept press and the
mining companies is only an at
tempt to throw dust in ypur eyes,
so that you can not see the real
issue. 1
If they gain control of the
Governor and the legislature,
they will smash you one on this
tax question. Remember that.
Remember those who protected
you in opposition to the Mine
Tax bill were called Red Flag
ers and dynamiters. Now they
hide behind patriotism and poi
son the public's mind by calling
those they cannot control I. W.
W. sympathizers, when they
know different.
As Governor of this state I
will have no debts to pay anyone
for money contributed to my
campaign, nor promises to keep
on aecount of contributions of
any kind. I will be your Gov
ernor, who asks only a clean
and efficient administration. It
will be my greatest effort to
harmonize the differences that
exist in our political, industrial
and social affairs in order to pre
serve and promote our strength
to win this war.
If you think the manner in
which I have managed my priv
ate affairs and the record and
experience I have had in public
life qualify me for the office,
then I solemnly remind you that
this year Primary Day will be
the vital day for real democracy.
