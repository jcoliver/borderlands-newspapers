ARIZONA NOTES.
Items of Interest Culled From Our
Exchanges.
The Powers boys haven't beeu
"surrounded" for several days,
and Deputy United States Mar
shal Frank Haynes of Globe,
who carried the warrant for the
arrest of the now outlawed men
when the Graham county sheriff
and his deputies were killed, has
not been heard from since be
made his materly run for "help."
Professional beggars hare
been numerous in Patagonia
lately. The word eyidently has
gone forth that the Patagonia
residents are "easy picking" ior
their kind. One recently came in
by automobile, and after "pan
handing" the town, left to pass
the word along to the profession
to get in while the getting was
Rood.
Pete Hansen was in town
Wednesday from the Bland
mine, in which he is interested
with Dr. Hardtmayer. He
brought in some fine specimens
of lead silver ore which he had
taken from the mine. The pro
perty has a bright future, and
we are glad to known that the
mine is looking lrke a coming
producer. Patagonian.
Members of the Pinal County
Cattle Growers Association who
attended the state convention of
the Cattlemen's organization at
Nogales last week bring back
word of a highly profitable con
vention, and are enthusiastic in
their appreciation of the selec
tion of Charles E. Mullen of
Skull Valley as the new presi
dent of the organization.
The Arizona State Bureau of
Mines does not in any way
recommend the purchase of any
oil or mining stocks and the use
of part of reports is a practice
that should be denounced by
every person, in the state, says
Charles F. Willis, director. The
Bureau of Mines disclaims any
knowledge of whether or not the
oil stocks on the market today
in this state are good or bad
investments.
The department of the Interior
has made it possible for the
cattlemen of Arizona to increase
their output, as the wild lands
of the Indians have been thrown
open to the grazing of range
cattle. This will not, however,
interfere with the rights of the
Indians living in these reserva
tions. It only means that which
is now going to waste may be
used by the cattlemen to help
the country in this great demand
for war food.
There are persistent rumors
that the 158th. infantry formerly
the First Arizona, stationed at
Camp Kearney, Calif., will soon
be on the move for the shores of
sunny France to be incorporated
into Gen. John J. Pershing s
Expeditionary Forces. A great
deal of credence is placed in the
rumors on account of the fact
that the regiment has been under
training, for a long time and
should be in fiist class shape to
fight the Boches Prospector.
The famous Flux mine, which
has been idle for some time is
likely soon to start operations.
Mr. Frederick Colberg of Bisbee
has been in Patagonia for some
time experimenting with the ore,
and believes that it can be work
ed at a profit under his manage
ment. It is hoped that the
property will be take: by the
parties who have been consider
ing its purchase, as it is close to
Patagonia and will, if operated
on the scale it should be, prove
of much benefit to the camp.
According to the best figures
obtainable from the Board of
Equalization, Arizona had within
her border during the year 1917,
live stock as follows: Range
cattte, 885,672, milk cows, 72,
277; steers, two jears and up,
27,088; bulls, 30,013; beef or
feeders, 24,195; graded cattle
2,212; sheep, 1,650,000; goats,
142,561; hogs, 22,484; horses and
mules, 71,313. The climate is
such in Arizona that the live
stock thrives exceptionally well
in this state, and is not subject
to the ills that usually trouble
live stock in other parts of the
country. Stockman -Farmer.
PAY YOUR INCOME TAY.
If j'our income is taxable
and it must be a modest one to
escape taxation under the. War
Revenue Act of October 8, 1917
don't wait to bo notified that
you must pay an income tax.
Tiie Government is not required
to seek the taxpayer. The tax
payer must seek the Govern
ment. The Bureau of Internal Rev
enue, with the approval of the
Secretary of the Treasury, has
extended the time for filing
income and excess profits re
turps from March 1 to April 1,
1918. You may file your return
any time before April 1, but if
you wait until April 2, you are
subject to fine of not Jess than
$20 nor more than $1,000 and an
additional assessment of 50 per
cent of the amount of tax due.
Returns are required of every
unmarried person man or wo
man whose net income for the
calendar year 1917 was $1,000 or
more! and of every married per
son whose net income was $2000
or more.
The rate of tax is at least 2
per cent on net income of u.n
married parsons in excess o
$1,000 and on net incomes of
married persons in excess of
$2, COO. Payment must be made
on or before June 15, 1918.
The estimated revenue to be
collected this year under the
War Revenue Act it $2,500,000;
000, of which $698,000,000 is in
individual income taxes. Last
year 500,000 persons paid in
come taxes; this year it is esti
mated the number will be more
than 6.000,000. If you are one
of them, remember that voar
dollars are for the support of
the war. By promptly filing
your return and promptly pay
ing your tax you are helping
the Government to an early vie
tory. Pay your income tax in
the same spirit in which you
bought your liberty bond. The
proceeds are for the same pur
pose to make the world safe
lor democracy.
A NATIONAL DUTY.
The Treasury of the United
States has a great deal of money
to raise and it cannot be raised
by bankers alone, says Secretary
McAdoo. The banks of this
country cannot alone sustain
America's needs in this war and
extend to our allies the essential
aid which they must have to
continue the war.
The rich of this country can
not do it alone; the men of this
country cannot do it alone; the
women of this country cannot
do it alone; but all of us, the
people of the United States,
disregarding partisanship, for
getting selfish interests, thinking
only of the supremacy of right
and determined to vindicate the
majesty of American ideals and
secure the safety of America and
civilization, can do the great and
splendid work which God has
called upon us to do.
ARIZONA IS RICH.
The total bank deposits of all
the banks of the state in Decern
ber, 1915, was $27,832,365.64.
One year later the deposits had
increased to $53,902,559.69 In
November of this year (the last
figures available) the deposits
totaled $62,060,860.72.
The copper mines of the state,
despite some unfortunate labor
troubles, produced 687,800,000
pounds of copper, nearly as
much as the big year of 1916,
and the value was considerable
more, bringing into the state
$185,490,000. Forty thousand
men were employed, receiving in
wages $62,400,000, and $35,000,
000 was returned to the stock
holders in dividends.
That agricultural development
is progressing in the vicinity of
Prescott, Arizona, is proven by
the shipment recently from the
Hassayampa Colony, located in
the fertile valley not far from
Prescott, of beans to Chicago
worth $15,000. The price receiv
ed was 12 cents per pound. The
raising of alfalfa is also receiv
ing considerable attention by the
farmers in this district.
OUTLAWS STILL AT LARGE
Murderers of Graham County Officers
May Escape.
Thomas Sisson and John and
Thomas Powers, the Graham
county outlaws, who killed She
riff McBride and two deputies
and who are being sought in one
of the greatest man-hunts in
the history of Arizona, are still
uncaptured, says Tbe Benson
Signal.
For two weeks posses have
been following their trail, but
they kept well out of the way of
the officers and citizens, who on
two or three occasions thought
they had them surrounded.
Once it was thought they were
penned up in Cochise Strong
hold. Then in Rucker Canyon,
and then in one place and an
other in the Chiricahua moun
tain region, but in each case, if
they were within the cordon of
armed hunters, they managed to
slip through and escape. Clues
and traces of the fugitives were
plentiful, in one instance the
pursuers coming upon the rem
nants of an unfinished meal
hastily abandoned. They were
followed so closely it is believed
that they had to abandon their
horses and travel on foot.
At last accounts the head
quarters of the trailers bad been
moved to Apache, and posses
sent north and west from there.
It is believed that the hunted
men are heading toward Mexico
and both American and Mexican
troops are closely guarding the
international line.
Sheriff Wheeler, who is head
iug the searching parties, says
if the fugitives go to Mexico he
will follow them across the line.
The officers of Graham, Pima
and Cochise county have been
co operating in the chase, be
sides cattlemen aud other citi
zens pressed into service, and
also a number of Apache Indian
trailers.
Seven troops of cavalry have
strengthened the patrol where
the outlaws would be likely to
cross the border.
STATE LOANS MONEY.
How the State of Arizona is
selling or leasing its vastdomain
of land to the settler with one
hand, and is loaning the money
thus received with tbe other to
aid development is shown by
figures recently compiled at the
state land department here.
That administration of the state
land code under policies now
being carried out is working to
the great advantage of the state
as well as materially helpers,
small, land owners and dry
farmers, is shown in a striking
way.
Out of a little over a million
dollars received from the sale
and rental of her lands, Arizona
has loaned half a million to
farmers living in ten different
counties of the fourteen, and in
addition is financing the Lyman
irrigation project in Apache
county with a loan of $150,000.
In other words, sixty per cent of
thejponey Arizona has received
from the sale and lease of land
has gone right back into the
pockets of the farmers to help
them develop their holdings.
As fast as the applications for
loans can be passed upon by the
state loan board, those accepted
are granted and the money goes
to work to build up the state.
From the sale of lands Arizona
has received during the past
fiscal year over $300,000. Ari
zona's share of the rentals of
lands on forest reserves brought
in another $300,000 or better,
while rental of stale lands at the
rate of three cents an acre added
$255,175 to the state treasury.
Timber sales amounted to $108,-
020 and miscellaneous fees to
approximately $80,000 more.
Classification and appraisement
fees brought in $31,281.
State lands are sold on a basis
of seven per cent of the purchase
price down, with the balance
payable in 38 annual install
ments, with interest on deferred
payments at the rate of five per
cent. Already over 361,000 acres
have been sold for a total
purchase price of $2,319,532, or
at an average rate of better than
$5.50 per aero Of . this amount
$301r088 has been paid, leaving
a balance due of $2,018,444, from
which the state derives an an
nual income of approximately
$101,000. Interest payments last
year from contracts made the
year before amounted to $41,028
and during the present year will
treble this amount. The Messenger.
AMERICAN ENERGY.
In an address to the British
house of lords, last week. Bonar
Law made the statement that
the British had increased their
ship tonnage only abouc 20,000
tons over that of the previous
year. At the same time he noted
that the United States had made
great progress in ship building,
the increase befng nearly 400,000
tons. The entire ship building of
the United States in 1917 was
above 900,000 tons. At tbe same
time throughout the United
States we hear railings against
the inefficiency of the navy
department and its lack of
energy in the matter of ship
building. America was un
prepared for war when it came
and is just now in the primer
class. But within a year Uncle
Sam's domain will be one of the
busiest hives of industry in the
world. It will be able to turn out
more shipping in a month than
can England in a year. It has
been getting busy. It has men
at the head of affairs on whom
the people can rely. Every one
wants to do something to win the
war and they are doing it. The
people have no cause for com
plaint, and it is to be hoped that
no one will put a thing in tbe
way of the war work that is now
going on, and if they are patriots
they will not. Miner.
A private enterprise has
undertaken the reclamation of
about 20,000 acres of land near
Congress Junction, Arizona.
Work has already been begun on
the erection of a dam across
Date Creek, where it is possible
to conserve 12,000 acre feet of
water by bringing the wall to an
eighty foot level. It i3 expected,
however, to later raise the wall
to 150 feet. The drainage area
is 400 square miles, and the
reservoir will be filled at least
twice a year.

Catarrhal Deafness Cannot Be Cured
by local application, as they cannot reach
the diseased portion of the ear. There
is only one way to cure catarrhal deafness,
end that is by a constitutional remedy.
Catarrhal Deafness is caused by an in
flamed condition of the mucous lining of
the Eustachian Tube. When this tube la
inflamed you have a rumbling sound or
imperfect hearing, and when it Is entirely
closed. Dpofncss is the result. Unless the
inflammation can be reduced and thio tube
restored to its normal condition, hearing
will be destroyed forever. Many cases of
deafness are caused by catarrh, which is
an inflamed condition of the mucous sur
faces. Hall's Catarrh Cure acts thru the
blood on the mucous surfaces of the sys
tem. We will give One Hundred Dollars for
any case of Catarrhal Deafness that cannot
be cured by Hall's Catarrh Cure. Circulars
