WILSON WcLCOMS DRAFT ARMY.
'Let Us Add New Laurel to Crown of
America," Says President.
SEED WHEAT OFFERED FREE.
Washington, D. C, Sept. 3.
Soldiers of the national army
were welcomed into the nation's
service today by President Wil
son with a message of affection
ate confidence and a prayer to
God to keep and guide them.
Everything these young men do
the president told them, will be
watched with the deepest solici
tation by the whole country and
the eyes of the world will be
upon them because they are "in
some special sense the soldiers
of freedom."
The first soldiers for the army
raised under the draft law start
from their homes for the train
ing cantonments Wednesday.
The president asks them as
brothers and comrades in the
great war to keep straight and
tit by a standard so high that
living up to it will add a new
laurel to the crown of America.
The message:
"The White House, Washing
ton: "To the soldiers of the nation
al army: You are undertaking
a great doty. The heart of the
whole country is with you.
Everything that you do will be
watched with the deepest inter
est and the deepest solicitude,
not only by those who are near
and dear to you, but by the
whole nation besides. For this
great war draws us all together,
makes us all comrades and
brothers, as all true Americans
felt themselves to be when we
first made good our national in
dependence. The eyes of all
the world will be upon you be
cause you are in some special
sense the soldiers of freedom.
Let it be your pride, therefore,
to show all men everywhere not
only what great soldiers you are
but also what goodmen you are,
keeping yourselves fit and
straight in everything and pure
and clean throngh and through.
Let us set for ourselves a stand
ard so high that it will be a
glory to live up to it and then
let us live up to it and add a
new laurel to the crown of Am
erica. My affectionate confid
ence goes with jtou in every bat
tle and every test. Good keep
and guide you.

Japan Would Help to Win the War.
Japan through Count Ishii will
offer America the use of her
shipyards for building bottoms
for either Atlantic or Pacific
trade and in return Japan will
seek to secure relaxation of the
steel embargo. It was stated
that Japan will postpone the
settlement of the question of the
Chinese "open door," the per
manent occupation of German
Pacific Islands, and Japanese im
migration to America until the
end of the war.
Whether she will offer a share
of her trans-Pacific tonnage for
the trans-Atlantic service de
pends upon the requests of the
allies. Japan has cast her lot
with the English speaking peo
ples and the real object of the
Japanese mission is to co oper
ate with England and America,
said a member of the mission.
The attitude of America toward
the proposed offer is as yet un
known but it is assumed that
some shipbuilding agreement
will be made.
The Eagle Milling Company of Tucson
Will Help Arizona Farmers.
As part of the big agricultural
movement throughout the coun
try the-Eagle Milling Company,
of Tucson, has come forward
with a most generous offer to all
farmers in the surrounding coun
ties interested in the planting of
wheat.
The Eagle Milling Company
proposes to send to the North
west and purchase all Early
Barr seed wheat that would be
required by the established farm
ers of this district and the dis
trict cantributory to Tucson.
This wheat will be distributed
free of charge not only for use
on the land they have under
cultivation but upon land they
will be urged to cleai for the
planting of seed. The supply
will be bountiful and the poor
farmer as well as the rich farm
er will be treated alike in the
golden harvest.
This seed being of the highest
grade obtainable will cost the
Eagle Milling Company about
$6.00 per hundred pounds. It
will cost the farmer nothing.
In return for the seed the
Eagle Milling Company asks on
iy that when the crop is harvest
ed, that the exact amount of
seed given will be first returned
to the Eagle Mill. The farmer
is not asked to pay for the seed
under any circumstances. If he
does not make a crop, if the
planting for any reason is a fail
ure, the Eagle Mill will write
the venture off its books to pro
fit and loss.
If however, there is a crop,
the amount furnished must be
returned first. After that, in
consideration for the investment
of the Eagle Mill, first oppor
tunity to purchase the balance
of the crop at the market price.
No matter what the price may
be at harvest time, or at the
time of delivery, the Eagle Mill
pledges itself to pay that price.
There will be no quibbling.
As a result of this purchase of
the crops of the district by the
Eagle Milling Company, not less
than a quarter of a million dol
lars will be distributed to the
farmers of the Tucson contri
butory district with the result
that the money will stay at
home. The Benson Signal.
THOUGHTS ON EATING.
Sheriff Harry Wheeler, chair
man of the local board of ex
emption, states that the report
is erroneous that there are 475
men at Columbus who registered
for the draft. The sheriff states
that only about forty men who
were registered were in the 1200
deportees. Of these about ten
have shown up here or in Tomb
stone for examination and of the
balance of about thirty, those
who are citizens have been cer
tified into the army. The report
that 475 of these men had re
gistered would make it appear
that a larger proportion of the
deported men were American
citizens and such is not the case
as is well known to every one
here. Bisbee Ore.
Here are some thoughts on
eating and not eating:
All efficiency of production be
gins with human efficiency.
Human efficiency begins with
proper eating.
Nearly everybody eats' too
much.
Proper elimination is just as
important as nourishment.
It is a good thing to eat bulky
food like vegetables and whole
wheat bread with added bran in
order to aid elimination.
Eat meat, but not too much of
it; it is too concentrated and
without enough bulk to elimin
ate itself alone.
Beware of greasy foods; grease
on foods is a digestion proof film
the gastric juices cannot get
at the food to digest it it is like
swallowing whole a piece of link
sausage. The same bodily en
ergy otherwise used in digest
ing greasy lood can be used to
more advantage in thinking and
acting on your thoughts. -
Chew your food, don't bolt it;
it is foolish to do with the sto
mach what can be done by the
teeth.
The same bodily energy used
in digesting food that has been
swallowed whole can better be
used for thinking and working.
The reason people feel stupid
and heavy after a heavy meal is
that all their energies are being
consumed in digesting food.
The reason so many of us can
concentrate and think and work
better late at night or in the
early hours of the morning lies
in the fact that the stomach is
empty and the bodily energies
are not being consumed in food
digestion.
A cold is a pretty good sign
that we are full of clinkers
eating too much.
We can starve out pretty near
ly any of the common ails like
I indigestion-, sluggish liver, colds,
! bronchitis and the common skin
eruDtions by a three to five day
fast. What we think is hunger is
mere emptiness.
During a . fast keep filled up
on water to relieve the feeling
of emptiness.
Eat liberally of oranges and
grape fruit to eliminate the fast
accumulation of clinkers.
Health and ill health is all
a battle between the good and
bad germs in the body; by fast
ing the bad germs are eliminat
ed by starvation. They are con
sumed while only the good germs
have the strength to survive.
PEACE PROPOSAL REJECTED.
President Wilson, acting as
spokesman for the allies, has re
jected the peace proposal of
Pope Benedict. The president
has made plain that it would be
lolly to take the path of peace
pointed out by the Pope, if it
does not in fact lead to the goal
he proposes. To deal with such
a power as the present rulers of
Germany upon the plan of the
Pope, declared the president,
would involve a recuperation of
the strength and renewal of the
world domination of that power,
now balked but not defeated,
after sweeping a continent with
the blood of women and children
and the helpless poor as well as
the soldiers.
Permanent peace must be bas
ed upon the faith of all the peo
ples and upon justice and fair
ness and the common rights of
mankind, he adds, and "we can
not take the word of the present
rulers of Germany as a guaran
tee of anything that is to en
dure, unless explicitly supported
by such conclusive evidence of
the will and purpose of the Ger
man people themselves as the
other peoples of the world would
be justified in accepting."
THE WORTHLESS LOAFER.
In nearly every community is
to be found some worthless loaf
er who has been lucky in escap
ing having his number drawn,
and the remark is frequently
heard that it is too bad these
worthless skunks were not taken
as soldiers instead of our indus
trious young men. At first
glance that would seen) a reas
onable proposition, but did you
ever stop to think that a dirty
loafer would be just as tfseless
as a soldier as a citizen. He has
a streak of yellow in his make
up, he is a moral leper and a
physical coward and you can't
make an American soldier out of
that kind of material. It is for
tunate for the country that the
worthless loafers escaped. Am
erican manhood is to them an
unknown quantity. It takes red
blood to make a soldier, and
moral fiber, and industry. That
is the reason loyal American
citizens are proud of their sol
dier boys. Winslow Mail.

OFF FOR DUTY.
Sania Cruz County Boys Given. Enthu
siastic Farewell Part.
The farewell giveft by Santa
Cruz county to her first offering
of younjf men to the national
army, will long be remembered
by the boys, their relatives and
friends.
Nogales and the county never
do things half way and the fare
well party yesterday afternoon
was no exception to the rule.
With lings flying from public
buildings, business houses and
private residences, the 3oth In
fantry band playing martial
music and the citizens cheering,
the five lucky young men, the
county's first quota of the army
draft, marched to the depot, to
entrain for Port Riley, Kansas,
where 40, (XX) of America's brave
boys will bo trained for service
in Prance, or elsewhere.
Before leaving for the front,
the new soldiers hoisted a large
flag to the flagpole in front of
the Town Hall, while thl band
played the national anthem.
The big parade formed in
front of the Montezuma hotel on
Morley avenue, and headed by
the 33th Infanty band and a long
line of pupils from the public
school carrying flags, marched
to the depot.
Mayor Clagett, members of
the Town Council, members of
the Chamber of Commerce and
other prominent citizens, led the
squad of the first fighting men
sent from Santa Cruz county.
All along the line the boys were
applauded by hundreds of
friands and acquaintances who
turned out to wish them God
speed. At the depot the 35th Infantry
band serenaded the honor squad
while relatives and friends said
"good bye" to the boys, each
one of whom wore a ribbon on
which was inscribed: "On my
way to Prance, from Nogales,
Arizona."
The following splendid young
men compose the first honor roll
from Sanca Cruz county:
Francis Robert Duffy, age 22
years, born in Nogales, Arizona,
had military experience at R. O.
T. C, Presidio, San Francisco,
v George O. Horrall, age 30
years, born in Washington,
Indiana, discharged as corporal
U. S. Army.

MEXICAN COTTON PICKERS.
The Mexicans are coming!
A whole trainload of them
men, women and children will
arrive in the valley tomorrow,
the first importation by the cot
ton growers of the valley of
labor to help pick the cotton this
season, says Wednesday's Ariz
ona Gazette.
According to W. H. Knox of
the Salt River Valley Egyptian
Cotton Growers' association,
there will be a total of 4000 la
borers imported to pick the cot
ton this season; but, it is stated,
that if any rancher is in need of
labor for any purpose, he is free
to make application for some of
these imported people to do his
work. The Mexicans are per
mitted to come into the United
States from Mexico under a spe
cial dispensation of the immi
gration lawSj allowing Mexicans
to cross the border and to re
main for a period of six months,
provided they are engaged in
agricultural work during all of
that time. At the expiration of
the time, the department of im
migration will see that these
people are deported. Those com
ing tomorrow to the valley are
brought from Mexico through
Nogales. Particular care is be
ing taken to see that the camps
established shall be morally and
physically clean.
Mr. Knox announces that Tol
leson and Glendale cotton grow
ers who wish to employ any of
the incoming Mexicans should
meet the train at Tolleson, while
Mesa, Phoenix, Tempe, Chandler
and Gilbert employers should be
stationed at the Tempe depot to
meet the train.

HAVE THE LAW ON 'EM.
Two additional cases, arising
from the passage of a county
classification law by the last le
gislature, have been appealed to
the supreme court. In these in
stances, however, the plaintiffs
or former office holders secured
judgment in the superior court.
W. S. McKnight, who served
as sheriff in Santa Cruz county
from February 14, 1912, to De
cember 31, 1916, was given judg
ment in the superior court
against the county to the extent
of $6,700. This amount, the
court ruled, is due him for ser
vices rendered according to the
county classification law.
R. R. Earhart, former treas
urer of Santa Cruz county, was
awarded $800 in the superior
court for back salary due him
under the classification act. He
served from January 1, 1915, to
December 31, 1916. His salary
was $1800 a year und under the
classification law it should have
been $2200 a year.
The county has appealed both
rulings to the supreme court.

Catarrhal Deafness Cannot Be Cured
by local applications, as th y cannot reach
the diseased portion of the ear. There.
Is only one way to cure catarrhal deafness,
and that is by a constitutional remedy.
Catarrhal Deafness is caused by an in
flamed condition of the mucous lining- of
the Eustachian Tube. When this tuba la
inflamed you have a rumbling sound or
Imperfect hearing, and when it is entirely
closed. Deafness is the result. Unless the
inflammation can be reduced and this tube
restored to Its normal condition, hearing
will be destroyed forever. Many cases of
deafness arc caused by catarrh, which la
an inflamed condition of the mucous sur
faces. Hall's Catarrh Cure acts thru the
blood on tho mucous surfaces of the sys
tem. We will give One Hundred Dollars for
any case of Catarrhal Deafness that cannot

PROFESSIONAL CARDS
TO BUILD DESTROYERS.
The navy department is to be
commended for its decision to
build the largest number of de
stroyers that can possibly be
turned out by our plants run
ning at maximum speed.
It has been found that the de
stroyer is the most efficient we
apon for fighting the submarine
and for protectiug our trans
ports. And so our resources
are to be taxed to the very limit
to give us just as many as can
be obtained.
To win this war we need air
planes and destroyers.
Plans are well under way for
giving u mastery of the air.
Airplanes will be produced by
the thousands in a short time.
Destroyers cannot be built as
quickly as airplanes, Jaub now
that we have learned of their
great need it is safe to say they
will be turned out in numbers
that will amaze our enemies and
give us the greatest fleet of de
stroyers in the whole world.
Now is the time for American
ship builders to show what Am
erican push, American efficiency,
American genius and American
hustle can do.
MR. KINNEY RETURNS.
Mr. J. C. Kinney, president of

oed to pasture from their range
south of Tucson, all did well, as
thev were sent to good pastures
Mr. Kinney is also interested
heavily in the West Coast Cattle
Company, and the Alamo Cattle
Company. He will leave tomor
row with Ramon Elias, manager
of the ranges, to look over the
country south of Tucson, where
the companies have thousands
of head of high grade cattle.
Feed is good on all the ranges
and Mr. Kinney will see a big
difference in the condition of the
ranges from what they were
when he went away in the
spring. Arizona Cattleman.
