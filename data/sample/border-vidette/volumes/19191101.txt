structed from Oracle to Mount
Lemmon at a cost of $175,000.

from Oracle to Tucson is now
one of the best in the state.

WORLD PEACE AND INOUblKiho
Earliest possible ratification of
the Peace Treaty and covenant
of League of Nations is of ut
most importance for the stabiliz
ing of industries and extension
of American commerce.
Pending the battle in the sen
ate, unnecessarily prolonged by
a small handful of ambitious
men, under the leadership of
western radical progressives, in
dustries are not expanding and
business drags.
Talking Oregon as a guide,
where senators are elected by
direct vote of the people, both
senators, one a republican and
one a democrat, both prominent
on committees, are supporters of
the Treaty.
With European nations, need
ing peace and reconstruction,
with Great Britain under the
stress and strain of industrial
revolution, with our own coun
try breaking up in mobs and
strikes, it is time to act.
The early ratification of the
Treaty and League of Nations
will mean a threat international
steadying hand placed on the
shoulder of discontent, and a
club to use against bolshevism
and anarchy.
Ask the most radical socialist
or most vicious labor agitator
what he thinks of the Peace
Treaty and League of Nations
he will tell you it is the one
thing to be defeated if the world
is to be Russianized.
In the name of peaceful devel
opment for our great nation, for
the resumption of world com
merce on normal bases, the high
est patriotic duty before Amer
icans is to lay aside partisanship
for world peace. Guardian.
HOMESTEADS.
To the average resident a
"Homestead" in Arizona means
government claim of 160 acres of
treeless, sunbaked Cactus-covered
desert land. A homestead
according to the Arizona law,
revised statutes of 1913, is a far
different piece of property. In
tfie one case, the homesteader
settles and lives on 160 or less
acres of government land, im
proves it and at the end of a
certain stated time, by paying a
certain amount and costs, he re
ceives a title to the land from
the United States government.
The homestead here discussed
is a bouse and lot, or land which
the owner, who is also the head
of a family designates and has
recorded as his homestead. He
must live in the house as his
home. This arrangement has
many advantages and should be
of interest to every home owner,
and especially to every wife.
As a rule, laws are not made
until a necessity for them exists.
So it may be reasoned that a
necessity for the "Homestead
Laws" has long existed. The
advantage of the law, is that it
gives the head of a family a safe
refuge in time of financial stress.
It gives the family a place to
live, no matter how hard the
times or how overwhelming the
debts. Our country, more than
any other, witnesses sudden and
unexpected changes of fortunes,
and many a fair day has ended
with a storm, in the financial
life of both rich and poor. The
homestead right gives the op
portunity to provide a life-long
home for a family. ,
A wife and mother is not so
apt to sign away her homestead
in order to use the money in spe
culative investments. In these
days of unfortunate misunder
standings that sometimes end in
divorce, there is-greater justice
for both parties in the division
of a homestead, than if the pro
perty is controlled by one of the
interested persons. It prevents
a kind, but unbusinesslike father
from contracting debts that will
swallow up the home. Lastly a
homestead develops an interest
in and affection for a home, it
stimulates improvement in the
home and grounds. It cultivates
Americanism.

poration Commission will journey

pose of conducting a hearing in
the matter of applications to
operate auto stage lines.
PATAGONIA DISTICT ACTIVE.
The Patagonia district is ex
periencing considerable mining
activity now, according to recent
arrivals.
Of large importance in the re
cent history of the district is
the sale of the Three R mine by
R. R. Richardson to the Magma
Copper company. The papers
have been signed locally and a
substantial payment made Mr.
Richardson. The Magma com
pany under the terms of the
working agreement will take
hold of the property the latter
part of this month, it is under
stood, and develop the ore re
sources. The Hardshell company has
sunk its double compartment
shaft to a depth of 400 feet. It
is sinking to tap a vein previous
ly tapped in an incline and the
juncture is expected to be made
at the depth ot between 700 and
800 feet.
The Flux Mining Company
now has about 100,000 tons of
silver lead ore blocked out in its
workings which ha ve been thor
oughly explored to the depth of
approximately 130 feet. Of the
total blocked out about 60,000
tons is carbonate ore and the re
mainder sulphides. The com
pany intends soon to start an
active campaign of development
which will require about six
months to complete. When it
has been finished it is the inten
tion to build a 100 ton smelter.

OFFICIAL NOTICE TO CATTLE
GROWERS.
Phoenix, Ariz., October 31.
To All Members of the Arizona
Cattle Growers' Association:
At the last annual meeting of
the Arizona Cattle Growers' As
sociation held in Phoenix Feb
ruary 11, 12 and 13, 1919, there
was a resolution passed endors
ing the Kendrick Bill with prop
er amendments. In addition to
the Kendrick bill there have
been introduced in the U. S.
Senate the Kenyon and other
bills along the same line, and
after finding out that the enact
ing into legislation of any of the
bills would mean so much to the
interest of the cattle industry at
large, there was called on the
29th of last month a meeting of
the Executive Committee of the
Arizona Cattle Growers' Asso
ciation to thoroughly discuss
and go over the various bills
pending. After a day's discus
sion of the Kendrick and Ken
yon bills, it was decided that the
interest was so intense that it
was best to call a meeting of the
entire association before any ac
tion is taken as to either of the
bills. Therefore the Executive
Committee instructed me as your
president, to call a meeting at
what I thought was the most
appropriate time to assemble the
members of the association for a
more thorough discussion for
final action.
Now, I deem it of utmost im
portance that every member of
the association should study the
bills and their effect very care
fully and make it a part of his
business to attend this meeting,
which we have called for Mon
day, November 10, 1919, in Phoe
nix, Arizona, in the north parlor
of the Hotel Adams, starting at
10:00 a. m., at this meeting we
will discuss the control of the
public lands by the federal gov
ernment and other business that
might properly come before the
meeting.
Very truly yours,
Chas. P. Mullen,
President Arizona Cattle Grow
ers' Association.
BRANDS IN DANGER.
The great Three R mines situ
ated in the Patagonia mountains,
owned by Colonel R. R. Rich
ardson of Patagonia, have been
sold to the Magma Copper Co.,
the big deal having been con
summated in Tucson last Wednesday.
Stockmen Have Less Than Two
Months to Establish Rights.
Only about half the stockmen
of the State have re recorded
their brands with the State Live
Stock Sanitary Board as yet.
Less than two months remain in
which they can insure for chem
selves the ownership of old time
brands. Any brand not re re
corded by December 12th is open
for use and will belong to the
first man who records it as re
quired by law.
According to Secretary Ed.W.
Stephens of the Live Stock San
itary Board, the re-recordine: of
the brands has been increasing
in volume steadily. At the same
time, a very large portion of the
live brands are still unrecorded.
Should the owners overlook
their duty too long, there is a
possibility that designing indivi
duals may record these brands
in their own names. The pre
sent owners, with stock running
under the brands would then
find themselves facing what
might prove to be very serious
complications if not actual loss.
Orders have been sent to every
Livestock Inspector in the De
partment to notify all stockmen
as far as they can of the neces
sity of re-recording their brands
and to warn them of the short
ness of the time remaining in
which they may protect their
rights to ownership. In this
way, the Live Stock Sanitary
Board hopes to reduce to a mini
mum the number of brands in
actual use and not yet re recorded.
TUCSON AFTER OUR GOAT.
The secretary of the Nogales
Chamber of Commerce is receipt
of a communication from a ranch
er near Tucson who wants to
buy some high grade milch goats.
Evidently he has heard that it is
hard to tret the goats of this
district and believes they must
therefore be crood ones.
Secretary Rankin calls upon
the goat raisers of the county to
communicate with him if they
want to sell some of their stock.
Incidentally, attention is called
to the fact that the goat-raising
industry of the county is one not
occupying the attention it should
Goats are said to thrive on our
hills, and both milch and An
gora goats are Drofitable invest
ments on a large scale.
Are we going to let the Tuc
son man get our goats at a
price?
The United States Civil Ser
vice Commission announces that
a Chauffeur non-educational ex
amination will be held on No
vember 14, 1919, for the purpose
of filling a vacancy in the posi
tion of Chauffeur in the Supply
office service at Nogales.

Sis Years Ago, Thinking She Might Die, Says Texas Lady, Bat Now
She Is a Well, Strong Woman and Praises Cardfri For
Her Recovery.
Royse City, Tex. Mid. Mary Kll
mon, of this place, cays; "After the
birth of my little girl my side com
menced to hurt me. I had to go back
to bed. We called the doctor. He
treated me. ..hut I got no better. I
got worse and worse until the misery
was unbearable I was in bed for
three months and suffered Euch agony
that I was Just drawn up in a knot. . .
I told my husband If he would get
-ne a bottle of Cardui I would try it. . .
I commenced taking it, however, that
ivenins: I called my family about
ue... for I hnew I could not last
nany days unlfess I had a change for j
the better. That was six years ago
and I am still here and am a well,
strong woman, and I owe my life to
Cardui. I had only taken half tba
bottle when I began to feel better.
The misery In my 6ide got less... X
continued right on taking the Cardui
until I had taken thiee bottles and I
did not need any more for I web well
and never felt better in my life... I
have nevfcr had any trouble from that
day to this."
Do you suffer from headache, back
ache, pains in sides, or other discom
forts, each month? Or do you feel
weak, nervous and faggsd-out? If so,
give Cardui, the woman's tonic, a
trial. J. 71
