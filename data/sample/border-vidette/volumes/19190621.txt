Colonel Greenway Gets $12,000,000
to Finance Line to Gulf.
Col. John C. Greenway, pren
eral manager of the New tor
nelia Copper company, is about
to realize the greatest dream of
his life.
Col. Greenway, who is in the
east, is said to have raised S1l
000,000 to build a railroad from
A.jo to the gulf and from A jo to
Tucson, which will give all of
the mines of Arizona an outlet
to tidewater.
After Col. Greenway built the
great plant at Ajo and made
such a huge success of what
some considered a doubtful ex
periment, he announced that he
had one further ambition which
was to build a railroad from
southern Arizona to the Gulf of
California aud establish a great
port there.
His dream seems about to be
realized. The surveying party
which is locating the right of
way is nearing the Mexican bor
der; the company has the neces
sary concessions and Col. Green
way is finding no difficulty in
financing his proposition.
Because of his nation wide re
putation as an engineer, his
ability for rapid execution and
his high integrity. Col. Green
way is said to have at his dis
posal ample funds for his project.

The more important ranges of
the state now are well stocked
with early 'summer grasses and
lorage plants, while the greater
number of them show continued
improvement, according to the

added that the supervisor of the

clared the season appeared to be
unusually favorable for all class
of stock.
Soldiers who fought in the
war with Spain lost in weight
on an average of twenty-two
pounds each; the average Am
erican soldier at the end of the
fighting in 1918 weighed twelve
pounds more than when he went
into the army. Contrasting the
work of the quartermaster and
the medical and the sanitary de
partments in the two wars isn't
exacting comforting to the pre
sent day critics.
During 1918 hunters of the
United States Department of
Agriculture and New Mexico
killed Wj gray wolves, ,34 moun

were killed at a total expense of

by their destruction, on the
basis commonly accepted by
stockmen, amounts to $215,930

nounced at military headquart

was not concerned in the out

"He determined, to the best of
his ability, that shots from the
Villistas were being tired into
El Paso; he sent his troops over
and dispersed the Villistas.
"General Erwin handled the
situation well, he did the right
thing and did it well.
"As far as this situation is
concerned, it is a closed incident
