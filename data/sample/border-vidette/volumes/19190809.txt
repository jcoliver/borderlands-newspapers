cient service and courteous treatment,
and so on.

PATAGONIA.
Interesting News Items Clipped From
the Patagonian.
The Patagonia Electric Light
Comoany is extending the new
service by erecting poles ani
wiring buildings on Main Street.
The "juice" will be turned on at
the Commercial Hotel and other
places within a few days.
Tte heaviest storm of the
season visited Patagonia last
evening. The flood waters in the
Sonoita River reached a higher
point than at any time during
the year. July precipitation
total over seven inches.
It has been stated on authority
which can not be doubted that
the Phelps Dodge interests of
Bisbee are this week making an
examination of the properties
owned by the Duquesne Mining
and Reduction Company at
Duquesne and Washington
Camp.
Superintendent W. J. Mitchell
of the El Paso mine at Mowry is
authority for the statement that
a good body of copper ore has
been uncovered in the shaft at a
depth of 300 feet. A station is
being cut on that level and it is
stated that next week an addi
tional force of 25 men will be
employed at this property.
The new state highway has
been definately located to Corral
Canyon, a distance of five miles
from town. From that point the
surveyors have a choice of two
routes, one up Monkey Canyon
and the other by the way of
Fort Crittinden. Preliminary
surveys are now being made to
determine the most feastible
route.
An enjoyable dance was given
at the home of Henry Pyeatt in
the Canilles last Saturday night
in honor of Lou and H. S. Pyeatt
and Lion Parker who recently
returned from service in France.
Splendid music was furnished
by L. F. Lockett and Pyeatt
brothers. A fine supper was
served and the many who were
in attendance spent a most en
joyable evening.
F. A. Stone of Patagonia is
one of the lucky oil investors of
this section. Some time ago he
purchased one share of stock in
the Wade Oil Company block d7,
paying 100. Wednesday it was
reported this company had
struck oil and that the stock
had jumped to $1000 a share. C.
N. Thaeffer also has one share
of the stock which he purchased
10 days ago for 150.
Work at the American Boy
mine, interrupted as a result of
the recent ;heavy rains, is now
expected to go forward without
further interference. The new
machinery is being installed at
this property and no further
delays are anticipated. The
American Boy is being developed
by A. F. Gross of Duluth, Minn.,
under a bond and lease. Harry
Armstrong of Ironton, Minn., is
superintendent at the mine.
W. C. Browning, manager of
the Magma Copper Company at
Superior. Ariz, and T. A.
Etlinger, mining engineer, arriv
ed in Patagonia Wednesday
evening and are now engaged in
making a thorough examination
of the Three R. mine for the
Magme company, and if the
report of these gentlemen to the
officials of the corporation is
satisfactory no doubt the pro
perty will be taken over by this
concern, one of the strong min
ing organizations of the state.
RELIC OF OLDEN DAYS.
While doing street work in his
new East Patagonia addition this
week Colonel R. R. Richardson,
unearthed a large "olla" or pot
tery jar, which was tilled with
burned human bones. These re
lics of a pre-historic race which
at one time inhabited Arizona
are quite common in this section
of the state but seldom is one
found in such a state, of preser
vation as the jar just discovered
History can teli nothing concern
ing this unknown race of people,
and scientists disagree as to
whether they belonged to the Az
tec or Toltec age. Patagonian.
THE STATE FAIR.
With the announcement by the
Arizona State Fair Commission
of an aggregate purse of $13,000
for the winners of the harness
events, the succjss of the turf
program of th s year's fairs is
assured beyond the shadow of
any doubts. The sum named is
twice th3 amount ever offered in
stakes at the local track, and it
is said to be the largest offer
made this year for a single week's
program anywhere in the United
States.
The liberality of the commis
sion in the matter of purse
money is due directly to the
efforts of J. C. Adams and others
of the horse racing commission,
who succeeded in interesting
mining and other large interests
of the state to make substantial
guarantees
Adams and Shirley Christy,
secretary of the fair commission,
are now in the east, interviewing
race horse owners for the pur
pose of interesting them in the
Arizona fair program, and it is
expected that their efforts will
result in obtaining the largest
number of entries from eastern
owners that has ever been made
on the Arizona track.
Tom E. Pollock of Flagstaff
has been named as head of the
racing committee this year,
which in itself insures the
success of this department. He
will be assisted by L. S. Cates
of Ray, B. A. Packard of Doug
las, Dr. C. A. Schrader of Tuc
son, Charles DeRyder of Douglas.
SILVER AND COPPER.
Silver and copper continue to
be in demand in all the world
markets. The need of silver has
stimulated mining and prospect
ing in every part of the globe
where the white metal is found,
and properties in all parts of the
country have changed hands at
fancy prices. It is predicted that
before the year is ended many of
the old silver properties of Santa
Cruz Co. which produced enor
mous quantities of the white
metal in the early days, will be
opened up and again will contri
bute their share of this much
needed metal and materially in
crease the world supply.
The demand for copper conti
nues to increase and prices are
slowly advancing to a point
where mining for the red metal
will be profitable in this district.
It is almost a certainty that the
county's two great copper mines,
the Three R and the Duquesne,
as well as a number of smaller
properties will soon be operating
in a profitable manner and do
nating their sharejtoward replen
ishing the vast amount of cop
per destroyed by the world war.

CHAMPION BRONCHO BUSTER.
Luther Swanner, of Spring
Valley, won the world's cham
pionship for riding bucking hor
ses at Prescott on the Fourth of
July. He captured first place in
the first contest. He did not ride
in the second contest. He rode
again in the third contest, winn
ing third place, and in the fourth
contest he took first place, giv
ing him the championship. Be
sides winning $440 in cash, he
will hold the handsome gold
medal, with five bars until 1920,
when he will have to put it up
for contest. The bars carry the
names of the winner of the
championships for 1916, 1917,
and 1918, and his own bar for
1919, besides the bar of presenta
tion. The medal is diamond
studded, and is a very valuable
affair intrinsically. If he should
win it a second time he may re
tain it permanently, but he must
ride in 1920 no matter what part
of the country the meet may be
staged.
It is understood that Swanner
put in a number of years riding
bucking horses with Buffalo
Bill's aggregation of rough riders

COMING RESIDENCE SECTION.

resident section of the town.

addition lies on the small rolling
hills above the Sonoita valley
proper, affording a splendid view
of the surrounding mountains,

"din and dust." Sunshine, pure
air and pure water will tend to
popularize this new addition
among those who want to build a
home in the very best location
to be found. Streets are now
being graded on this tract of
land, the brush is being removed
and other improvements made.
