ARIZONA NOTES.
Items of Interest Culled From Our
Exchanges.
With several hundred acres of
cotton to harvest next fall, and
several hundred head of fat hogs
to market along about the same
time, our farmers will be feeling
pretty cocky. It's time they
were having an inning.
More than ten thousand acres
of land in the great Yuma valley
are being leveled for planting to
farm products next year, mostly
cotton. Everywhere the hum
of this class of industry is pro
I i fie, and as the days go by others
are becoming interested.
What is believed to be a record
price for desert land, was re
ceived by H. C. Meyer when he
sold 640 acres of desert for $38,
400. The land was sold to Ed
ward R. Jeffery of Los Angeles,
who will at once drill wells and
install pumping plants prepar
atory to the cultivation of cotton
on the tract.
The daily press of Pboenix,
with republican leanings, are
pleased to refer to the meeting
of the Democratic State Ex
ecutive committee at Phoenix as
a "Hunt" committee. This com
mittee was elected by the demo
cratic voters in each country.
One thing certain, it wasn't a
"Campbell" committee. Copper
Era.
John Twomey of Tammany
Hall," is making arrangements
for a decided improvement in
his establishment. He is going
to move the front bark and will
put there instead new fixtures,
featuring high grade cigars and
tobaccos. His famous bulletin
board will be moved inside a few
feet but will remain a permanent
part of the Hall. -Bisbee Review.
Foreign relations of the United
States should be considered in
the light of intelligent citizen
ship and Americanism, entirely
free from partisan bias. The
situation is too grave when the
destiny of one hundred millions
of human beings is at stake, to
quibble for partisan advantage.
Every citizen should be a patriot
first, regardless of party affilia
tions.
A rate hearing will be held in
the federal court, Phoenix, Feb.
9 to decide whether railroads are
entitled charge more for passage
from eastern points to Arizona
than they do from the same point
to the mountain states in the
north. The rates to Arizona
are about the same as those to
California also. The case is
brought by the Arizona corpora
tion commission.
Compulsory education will ap
ply to all children under eigh
teen years of age within the
state of Arizona unless excused
for valid reason by the school
trustees, if a bill introduced in
the legislature by Represent
ative McGrath of Greenlee coun
ty, becomes a law. The present
school age limit is 16. The bill
has been referred to the com
mittee on education.
Advices from Washington re
ceived Wednesday were to the
effect that President Wilson sent
the name of John L. Irwin to
the Senate for confirmation as
register of the Phoenix Land
Office, to fill the vacancy caused
by the death in September of
Thos. P. Weedin. Mr. Irwin is
a resident of Phoenix, where he
has been prominently identified
with the democratic party of the
state for many years.
Mrs. E. E. Bethell this week
received an Indian basket, to be
placed with her already large
and valuable collection of these
curios, which is of unusual inter
est and evidently of considerable
age. It is known as a burden
basket, having been used by the
aborigines for carrying loads, by
means of strapping it around
the forehead and letting it hang
down the back. It is intricately
woven of native grasses, and
was made by the Pima Indians.
The basket was presented to
Mrs. Bethell by Fred J. Gold
smith, who formerly lived in Pa
tagonia, but who is now in the
Casa Grande country. Pata

Silver prices have remained
steady aDd unaffected by peace
talk, the quotation being a little
over 75c an ounce. There seems
to be a. general impression that
peace will cause even higher
prices for silver, and some of
the nation's students of finance
are predicting an eventual price
of $1 for the white metal, which
would mean great prosperity for
the silver producers.
Prosperity in Arizona seems
to be general and as a result the
city of Douglas is preparing to
spend a half million dollars in
paving streets. At Yuma the
paving of Main street is in pro
gress. Flagstaff is in line and
while it is too cold up there to
pave at present, preparations
are under way to begin early in
the spring. Kingman is another
rapidly growing place.
A contract for drilling a water
well to maximum depth of 800
feet at the Papago village of San
Miguel, in the extreme south
western portion of the reserva
tion, west of the Barbaquivara
mountains, has been let to Phil
Head, a drilling contractor of
Tucson. The work is to begin
within the next twenty days. Mr.
Head has drilled several other
deep wells for the Indian service
in that part of the reservation.
Arizona last year produced 6,
711,800 fine ounces of silver and
$4,378,400 in gold, a large in
crease over the production of
1915. With the large mills in
operation and many more big
producing mines the state will
make a record production of the
precious metals in 1917. Great
is Arizona. Its gold, silver and
copper production exceeds in
value the metal production of
any state in the union. Mohave
Miner.
Transformation of the Douglas
brewery into an ice plant is the
plan of stockholders of the Cop
per City Brewing company,
which has filed a petition in dis
solution in the superior court of
Cochise county. Principal stock
holders in the concern have ask
ed to have the company disincor
porated and will form a new
company for the purpose of
manufacturing ice. A shortage
of ice existed in Douglas last
summer in spite of the fact that
a carload was shipped in from
Tombstone.
In the vicinity of Yuma more
than 10,000 acres of land are be
ing leveled preparatory to plant
ing cotton. Through interces
sion of Senator Winsor the rate
on cotton seed from Tempe to
Yuma was reduced from 65c to
25c per hundred. When the
matter was referred to the cor
poration commision it was found
the rate from Yuma to Tempe
was 25c while the rate from
Tempe to Yuma was 65c. The
commission made the rate the
same each way and the South
ern Pacific accepted the rating.
Three horses and three mules,
owned by Orville Bozarth, died
at his ranch near Williamson
valley Thursday afternoon after
eating barley that had been
poisoned by a forest service offi
cial, with the object of killing
golphers and prairie dogs last
summer. The balance of the
unused fodder was placed in a
sack and stored away in the
barn, and in some manner, not
known, the animals reached that
place and devoured all that was
left, about 25 pounds. One of
the horses was valued at over
$300, and the mules at $750.
Prescott Journal.
Mining laws should be plain,
simple and explicit, so as to
work the least hardship on the
prospector and those who de
velop likely prospects. This is
of vital importance in Arizona,
the best mineralized section of
the world. The industry of min
ing is yet in its infancy but in
hundreds of localities the sound
of the hammer may be heard.
These men should not be ham
pared by complicated laws that
need lawyers and courts to inter
pret. Early day mining devel
oped more lawsuits than paying
mines and the lawyers as a rule,
have prospered in all mining
camps of the west.
MILITARY ROAD ORDERED.
New Highway will Connect Borderland
Routes.
General Fred Funston, com
manding the border troops, has
authorized the expenditure of
$9000 for the construction of a
military reservation at Fort
Huachuca to eliminate round
about routes from Douglas to No
gales and other border points,
according to advices received
from the Nogales Chamber of
Commerce, says the Tucson
Citizens.
The military highway will con
nect the highway of the border
land route with a completed road
built by the forestry service
from Canille to the base of the
Huachuca. It will give prac
tically direct good roads from the
military reservation at the fort
to Nogales, Lochiel, Naco, Bis
bee and Douglas on the border
and Tucson and communication
with the interior, eliminating
desert traveling.
The construction will begin at
the eastern side of the Fort
Huachuca military reservation
boundaiy and run across the re
servation to connect with the
road built by the forestry service
to the western boundary of the
reservation. The forestry serv
ice road carries the route to Ca
nille, with branches to Nogales,
Tucson and Lochiel. Ic would
eliminate the present necessity
of crossing the desert to reach
these points.
At its eastern end the part
authorized by general Funston
will connect with the already
established borderland route at
Hereford. This road has bran
ches to Naco, Douglas and Bis
bee on the border.
The work done by the For
estry service on the connecting
road cost about $4,500.
There remains a little strip of
the road, about three quarters
of a mile, to be completed to con
nect the road authorized by
Funston with the system of
border or military roads, that
will result from the construction
now ordered.
The matter had been consider
ed by General Funston previous
ly and rejected. During his re
cent tour of inspection, how
ever, be became impressed with
the importance of having ready
access to the border from the
fort and from the fort to the in
terior, and it is said, ordered the
work to begin. Although the
cost is set at $9,000, it is not im
probable that the work would
require much more, since there is
considerable rock work involved.
ARIZONANS AT THE CAPITOL.
Washington, Jan. 20.- Cato
Sells, United States commis
sioner of Indian affairs, made
the principal argument against
any reduction of the Papago In
dian reservation at the hearing
before Secretary of the Interior
Franklin K. Lane, which began
Thursday evening. Mr. Sells,
who inspected the reservation
before it was created and upon
whose recommendation it was
created, argued that it was not
large enough. It was for Sells
that Frank M. Thackery, Indian
agent at Sacaton, proposed to
name the reservation.
United States Senators Marcus
A. Smith, and Henry F. Ashurst
and Congressman Carl Hayden
attended the hearing. Those
present on behalf of the state
and Pima county were W. H.
Moeur, state land commissioner;
J. W. Estill, chairman of the
board of supervisors of Pima
county; W. C. Goetz, county
engineer of Pima country, and
Judge John H. Campbell, coun
sel. Frank M. Thackery, Indian
agent at Sacaton, and Jule Mar
tin, Indian agent at San Xavier,
were present at the hearing.
Messrs, Moeur, Estill and
Goetz made statements to the
secretary pointing out the
absurdity of such a large reserva
tion for 5600 Indians and Judge
Campbell argued the case at
length.
The secretary gave no indica
tion as to his probable action nor
when he would render a decision.
COTTON GROWING IN ARIZONA.
ij lih; jicaeui wriwug lb ap
pears that the growing of short
staple cotton is a dead industry
in the Salt River valley. Let
us hope that it will stay dead as
long as the production of Egyp
tian cotton continues to give sa
tisfactory returns to the grower.
Each cotton growing community
should settle as quickly as pos
sible on some variety to which
the local conditions are adapted.
The Imperial and Yuma valleys,
like the Salt River - valley were
favored with ideal conditions for
growing Egyptian cotton. The
farmers in the first two named
districts failed to see the ad
vantage in growing a variety of
cotton to which no other part of
the country than the arid South
west is adapted, and consequent
ly these districts do not enjoy
with the Salt River valley the
favorable prospects to which
they were naturally entitled.
The Yuma and Imperial valleys
have no monopoly on the com
mon "American Upland" or on
the "Durango" cotton. In grow
ing them they continue subser
vient to conditions in the eastern
"cottonbelt" states which will
always govern the prices they
will secure for their product
grown on more expensive land.
With the present outlook for the
Egyptian cotton growing indus
try in the Southwest, the Stockman-Farmer
advises the farmers
of the Imperial and Yuma val
leys to get in line with the Salt
River valley and to abandon as
soon as possible the growing of
the less profitable varieties.
Stockman -Farmer.
ARIZONA SCHOOLS PRAISED.
Arizona schools are given high
praise in the preliminary report
on the Arizona school system
made a few months ago under
the director of the United States
commissioner of education.copies
of which were received here yes
terday, says the Tombstone Pros
pector. The report, though on
ly partial, goes into detail and
is a voluminous document. Its
criticism appeared to be aimed
chiefly at the lack of centralized
authority given the state de
partment of education, which it
says should be completely re
moved from politics. Summar
izing the status of elementary
and secondary education in the
state, the report says:
"In general it may be said
that the schools of Arizona rank
high, comparing favorably with
those of the other states most
advanced id education. The ex
penditures for public education
in proportion to the wealth of
the state and the expenditure
per school child are about the
average for western states. The
method of raising funds for
school support has proved excel
lent, the unit of support is large
and the small school is provided
with at least $850 for mainten
ance each year. New suitable
buildings are being erected at a
repid rate to replace the large
number of pioneer buildings still
standing and in use. The per
centage of teachers who are pro
fessionally trained is larger than
in the majority of states, and the
salaries paid are higher than
those paid in any, with possibly
two or three exceptions. The
state seems alive with the desire
for the best in education but
there is lacking the centralized
administration necessary if all
educational agencies in the state
are to be kept in touch with each
other and if definite constructive
leadership is to be furnished so
that state-wide progress will be
had without unnecessary delays
and expense."
All agree that the year 1916
was the banner year in mining
in Arizona, but the year 1917
bids fair to make a new record
of output. This is evidenced by
the rapid development of outside
properties near the big mining
camps, also in other districts.
With this spreading out the min
ing towns cease to be one man's
camp and it means a new era of
freedom. When mining becomes
so diversified that a few men
cannot control, then will Ariz
ona have truly come into its own. E. D. MILLER. Editor and Prop.
Entered as Second-Class Matter at
Nogales, Arizona, January, 1898.

GOING HOME.
More Than 25,000 National Guards
men to Leave Border.
Washington, Jan. 23. More
than 25,000 National Guardsmen
now on the Mexican border have
been designated by Major Gen
eral Funston for return home
and muster out of the Federal
service.
All these organizations will be
started homeward as soon as
transportation facilities can be
provided. Their departure will
leave between 45,000 and 50,000
men of the guard still in the
Federal service doing border
patrol.
The statement announcing the
guardsmen designated for relief
does not connect these orders
with the withdrawal of Persh
ing. The understanding has been,
however, that with the return of
the expedition in 'Mexico and
readjustment of the border patrol
all of the state troops gradually
would be sent home.
The department's statement
said:
"Gefl; Funston has selected
these organizations chiefly in ac
cordance with the rule of return
ing first those troops longest in
service on the border. To some
extent, however, this rule could
not be followed without unequal
weakening of the border guard
and the departures from it are
so explained. The total strength
of the organizations selected is
25,243."
The guardsmen designated for
return and muster includes mil
itia from the following states:

ASHURST'S BILL SIGNED.
Forty Thousand Acres Yuma Mesa to
Be Reclaimed.
Washington, Jan. 25 Senator
Ashurst's bill providing for aux
iliary project in connection with
the Yuma project, was today
signed by President Wilson.
The president invited Senator
Ashurst the author of tha bill,
to be present at the signing and
later presented the senator with
the pen, with which the bill was
signed.
The bill proposes to secure the
irrigation of some 40,000 acres of
rich mesa lands on the Yuma
project, which are free from the
dangers of frost and are regard
ed as some of the best citrus
fruit lands in the United States.
The law provides a means by
which it is made possible that
work of reclaiming the mesa
lands of the Yuma project may
be continued without further ex
pense to the United States or
draft upon the reclamation fund,
a work which in the present
condition of the reclamation fund
must otherwise be delayed for
many years.
The law purposes to create an
auxiliary reclamation fund to be
constituted of the proceeds of
the sale of the future water
rights which will attach and be
come appurtenant to the lands
when the irrigation works have
been completed. No works are
to be undertaken until a suffi
cient sum has been subscribed
and paid in to insure the com
pletion thereof. It also provides
for the payment into the reclam
ation fund or a sufficient amount
to cover the proportionate cost
of the main Yuma project works.
The mesa lands of the Yuma
project are the best citrus fruit
lands in the United States, free
from the dangers of frost, and
are worth much more when irrig
ated than the cost of the irriga
tion works necessary fully to re
claim them.
It is believed that experienced
citrus fruit growers will gladly
pay for such lands the prices that
will be fixed under this law and
that the resulting benefits to the
Yuma project as a whole and to
the reclamation fund will wholly
justify the experiment. Under
its provisions the money must be
paid into the Treasury before
any liabilities are incurred or ex
penditures made for construction
purposes, and none in excess of
the amounts so paid in.
BETTER ARIZONA ROADS.
Washington, Jan. 25. Appor
tionment of $10,000,000 to aid
the states in the construction of
rural post roads, the second an
nual distribution in accordance
with the federal aid road law,
was announced today by Secre
tary Houston of the department
of agriculture. The funds are
the apportionment for the fiscal
year ending June 30, 1918.
To meet the cost of adminis
tering the law, $300,000 has been
deducted. Allotments to West
ern states follow:
Arizona, $137,027: Colorado,
$167,380; New Mexico, $157,475;
Texas, $583,855.
In addition $1,000,000 will be
apportioned for the development
of roads and trails within or
partly within the national for
ests. The law provides that
$15,000,000 shall be apportioned
in the fiscal year of 1919; $20,
000,000 in 1920 and $25,000,000
in 1921. JANUARY 27, HH7,
THE 640-ACRE LAW.
Summary of New Act Providing; tor
Grazing Homesteads.
The bill authorizes the Secre
tary of the Interior to designate
the land which will be subject to
entry under the bill. It will re
quire some time to do this, and
those who attempt to make
filings under the bill prior to
such designation by the Secre
tary must do so at their own
risk. The bill provides how
ever, that settlers may file on
land before the Secretary has
completed the work of designa
tion. The application must be
accompanied by affidavits show
ing that in the opinion of the
entryman the land is of the
character contemplated by the
act. In addition to that the
entryman must deposit with the
land office the regular fees and
commission and thereupon the
land will be withdrawn from
entry until the Secretary of the
Interior shall have an opnor
tunity to determine its character
The entryman however will not
be permitted to occupy the land
until the Secretary has actually
designated it as subject to en
try. Any person qualified to make
entry under the general home
stead laws of the United States
may make a stock raising home
stead entry. Instead of cultiva
tion, as required by the general
homestead laws, the entryman
will be required to make improve
ment on the land of a value of
not less than 1.25 per acre, and
at least one half of the improve
ment must be placed on the land
of not less than $1.25 per acre,
and at least one-half of the im
provements must be placed on
the land within three years from
the date of the entry.
The bill provides that settlers
who have made filings under the
general homestead law and am
endments thereto may make
additional filings sufficient to
give them 6i0 acres. However,
they must show that the land on
which they originally filed is of
the same character as the land
affected by the 610 acre bill in
other words, that it is "chiefly
valuable for grazing and raising
forage crops, does not contain
any merchantable timber, is not
susceptible of irrigation from any
known sources of water supply,
and is of such character that
640 acres are reasonably requir
ed for the support of a family."
The land converted by an addi
tional entry must be within a
radius of twenty miles from the
settler's first entry, and the en
try man is required to file on
contiguous areas which may be
open to entry prior to filing on
non-contiguous land.
Homesteaders who are living
on their original entries are not
required to establish residence
on their additional entries. When
they come to prove up it will
only be necessary for them to
show that they have made the
required permanent improve
ments. In case a homesteader finds he
cannot make an additional entry
within the prescribed radius of
20 miles he may, if he sees fit,
surrender his original filing and
make a new entry covering 640
acres. The second entry, how
ever, must be in the same land
district as the first. Home
steaders who are entitled to make
additional entries have preferen
tial right to file on lands for
ninety days after the Secretary
of the Interior has designated
the land subject to entry under
the provissions of the bill. In
case this preferential right leads
to a conflict between home
steaders the Secretary of the
Interior is authorized to make a
division of the land.
The United States reserves all
the coal and other mineral of the
land subject to entry.

No armed guards were ever
kept at the capitol.no usurpation
of authority was ever attempted
by the governor and the contest,
while retarded by dilatory tac
tics of Mr. Campbell's attorneys,
has been conducted under stipu
lation and according to law. The
mandamus proceedings before
the supreme court were begun
and carried out by agreement.
Gov. Hunt remained in the office
because he thought, and the re
view of ballots show he has a
clear majority of 147 votes; be
sides for the purpose of secur

Campbell's attorneys agreed to
two things: To hasten the count
of ballots, which they did; also
to try to oust the governor by
mandamus proceedings, lie agree

Early this week, Monday at 5
o'clock, inspection of remants
gathered from the various boards
of supervisors under order of
superior court and at request of
Mr. Campbell's attorneys, was
stopped short because Mr. Camp

costs. It was all right to heap
costs on the governor by delay
but when their turn came to put
up, they had a different tune

These odds and ends were

offices of the various boards of

The ballots in the hands of
county treasurers were complet
ed on Monday, January 8. Con
test action is set for January 25
in superior court.
Senator Ives was ready for
trial as soon as the ballots were
all inspected and on January 8
he offered to begin next day.
Judge Sloan and his associates
asked to draw more cards, evi
dently knowing full well their
hand was no good. They asked
for the spoiled ballots and rem
nants, hoping to gain time but
when the expense of their re
quest was chalked up to Mr.
Campbell, he quit like a steer in

PEOPLE OF ARIZONA WANT
THE TRUTH.
Never before in the history of
Arizona have the people been so
universally interested in a single
subject as at the present time,
in their desire to learn the truth
about contest proceedings for
governor.
Ten years will not efface from
the memories of fair minded
men, irrespective of party or of
preference, the cowardly and
dastardly attempts of the daily
papers of Phoenix in their ef
forts to suppress the news, dis
seminate untruths and to stir up
hatred. About the first of the

attempts to incite riot, and in
Labon Luera, range foreman
for the Colin Campbell outfit, is
the hero of northern Arizona as
the result of a terrific battle in
which he killed a huge mountain
lion with a small hatchet. The
lion, wh'ch had been killing
sheep on the range, was dis
covered by Luera inside his tent
when he went there to get a rifle
to hunt the beast. Picking up a
small hatchet Luera attacked the
lion and in spite of severe lacera

toe, without affecting the surround

reason we urge you in buying to
be cartful to get the genuine

The reputation of this old, relia

ly established. It does not imitate
other medicines. It is better than
others, or it would not ba the fa

If Always Helps
says Mrs. Sylvania Woods, of Clifton Mills, Kj., in
writing of her experience with Cardui, the woman's
tonic. She says further: "Before I began to use
Cardui, my back and head would hurt so bad, I
thought the pain would kill me. 1 was hardly able
to do any of my housework. After taking three bottles
of Cardui, I bcg?.n to feel like a new woman. I soon
gained 35 pounds, and now, I do all my housework,
as well as run a big water mill.
I wish every suffering woman would give
k4
The Woman's Tonic
a trial. I still use Cardui when I feel a little bad,
and it always does me good."
Headache, backache, side ache, nervousness,
tired, worn-out feelings, etc, are sure signs of woman
ly trouble. Signs that you need Cardui, the woman's
tonic. You cannot make a mistake in trying Cardui
for your trouble. It has been helping weak, ailing
women for more than fifty years.
