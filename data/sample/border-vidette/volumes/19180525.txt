A. R. Gatter, for ten years?
general agent of the Arizona
Eastern railroad in Phoenix, and
one of the best skilled traffic
men cf the southwest, has been
given a Red Cross appointment
that will take him to France as
assistant to Poster Rockwell,
also of Phoenix.
The United States Public
Health Service is in need of
medical officers for. field duty in
connection with the sanitation
of several civil sanitary dis
tricts. Men physicaliy disquali
fied from the medical reserve
corps are eligible for these posi
tions, providing they are not
suffering for complaints that
would seriously interfere with
the performance of their duties.
When Pima county sends its
last 97 men of Class 1 to Camp
Cody, Deming, on May 27
that's Monday week the pros
pects are that it will sit out of
the draft game for awhile, as
will all Arizona, which will have
been practically drained of its
young men who are without de
pendents. The call of the pro
vost marshal general will be
made hereafter on other states.
It is estimated by the local
board of Maiicopa county that
there will be approximately 500
men registed for military service
on June 5, the day set by the
government for all men becom
ing of age since last June, when
there were about 5,200 men sign
ed up between the ages of 21
and 31. The board estimates
that 10 per cent of this number
will be the registration next
month.
A road was opened by the
county board of supervisors at
its last negular meeting that
will be of much benefit and con
venience to persons wishiDg to
get through the Canille Pass by
way of the San Rafael valley.
The road will run in a direct line
from the Red Rock school bouse
to the forest reserve, and will
settle a controversy of long
standing between neighbors of
the valley who have had the
question up for consideration for
several months. Patagonian.
A few days ago fourteen steel
cars loaded with 20,000,000 in
silver arrived in San Francisco
for transshipment to the Orient.
The shipment of this silver is in
line with the rule of the treas
ury department that no gold
shall hereafter be sent out of
the country, all settlements to
be made in either credits or sil
ver. This is the first of many
shipments that are to be made
to China, Japan and liiurope.
The shipments to the Orient is
of cofns, but the European ship
ments are to be in bullion.
The Federal food administra
tion for Arizona has been ad
vised from Washington that
there will be no increase price
allowed for bread in the state on
account of the difference in the
price of substitutes and wheat
flour. The telegram states:
"Prices of these substitutes are
being regulated and show mark
ed downward tendency. Corn
meal is now obtainable at much
less than wheat Hour and corn
flour, rolled oats and barley
flour are offered at .the same
price as wheat flour or less.
The price of substitutes does
not, therefore, justify any ad
vance in bread prices.
Master Gordon Jaeger, son of
Mr. and Mrs. Gus Jaeger, won
the boys' prize of a $5 war sav
ings certificate offered by Mr.
Bracey Curtis, president of the
First National Bank of Nogales
to the boy selling the largest
number of thrift stamps up to
the time school closed for the
season. The fact that Master
Gordon is the son of German
parents makes his accomplish
ment more remarkable. The
Jaegers are thorough Americans
and are not in sympathy with
the blood-thirsty monarch of
Germany. They are doing all
they can to help the allies over
throw the kaiser. Gordon sold
5185.75 worth of thrift stamps.

THE COPPER STATE.
The production of copner in
Arizona during April, of this
year, indicates that Arizona is
now producing about one half of
all the copper produced in the
United States. Isn't this going
some for a little state that a few
year's ago was not considered
worthy of statehood by even
some of our own people, and
was inveighed against by certain
members of congress. The mines
reporting for April show a pro
duction of 76,000,000 pounds or
at the rate of 900,000,000 for the
year. As only about 2,000,000,
000 pounds was produced last
year our readers will be impress
ed with the magnitude of the
showing of the big mines. And
before the end of the year a few
more mines will be brought in,
as well as the big smelter of the
U. V. Extension at Jerome. And
again there are many small
mines in the state that have not
reported, nor are they taken
into consideration in summing
up the totals. Miner,
CARD OF THANKS.
A standing vote of thanks and
appreciation to the people of
Patagonia and vicinity for their
splendid patronage of the recent
benefit dance iu aid of the K. of
C. war fund, was given by No
gales Lodge K. of C. at its last
meeting. The sum of $131.44
was realized for this splendid
object, and we of Nogales Coun
cil, K. of C, desire to express
our very sincere appreciation to
the people of Patagonia and
surrounding district.

W. A. MOEUR FOR GOVERNOR
Pledges an Economical and Business
Administration for Arizona.
Hon. W. A. Moeur, State Land
Commissioner, announces his
candidacy for the nomination of
governor of Arizona, subject to
the action of the Democratic
party at the primary election
next Semptember, in the follow
ing declaration of principles:
To the people of Arizona:
In offering myself as a candi
date for the nomination on the
Democratic ticket for governor
of the State of Arizona, I wish
to submit to the voters and citi
zens of this State the following
reasons why 1 am asking for
your support to the highest of
fice in the State and my position
on some of the vital and leading
questions and pending legisla
tion, which, in my opinion,
should be worked out and final
ly adjusted to the mutual benefit
of all concerned.
First I pledge my support in
any and every way to the Presi
dent of the United States in the
vigorous prosecution of the great
war in which we are involved, to
a final and successful conclusion
Second I am in favor of and
will lend my assistance to the
development of all the great re
sources of our commonwealth
for the benefit of the Nation and
the citizens of the State.
Third I will encourage and
protect, as far as is in my power
to do so, capital invested and
used in the development of our
State and its resources.
Labor disturbances in the
great mining centers of Arizona,
in the past four years, indicate
that some remedial legislation is
necessary to prevent the con
tinuance or recurrence of such
conditions. Our coantry is in
need of every pound of copper
our mines can produce, and, in
order to secure the best results,
capital and labor should put
aside their differences, great or
small, and all work for the com
mon good, to the end that our
government be not deprived of
the useful and necessary mineral
commodities for the successful
prosecution of the war. On the
shoulders of the laboring men
and women fall the greater and
more difficult burdens, all the
necessaries of life have ad vane
ed in price and will continue to
advance, and to meet these con
ditions, employers of labor must
realize the necessity of increas
ing wages in proportion to the
increasing cost of living. Leg
islation regulating the compen
sation of working men and wo
men is a difficult and delicate
problem, but there is no reason
why some fair and equitable
basis may not be reached,
whereby those who produce the
wealth of the State will in a
greater measure share in its
profits.
Strikes and labor troubles be
ing disastrous to the men who
strike, as well as to the busi
ness interests of the State, de
prive the government of the
copper products of our State,
which is essential to the sue
cessful conduct of the war.
With a view of adjusting these
matters so that capital will be
protected in its investment, and
the laborer be given a just and
equitable wage, in order that he
able to meet his obligations, take
care of his family and thus re
move the cause of discontent
and put an end to strikes and
labor troubles, I promise the
people of Arizona, if nominated
and elected governor, that I will
support proper and constructive
legislation and the administa
tion of the same, to the end that
our laboring class of people re
ceive proper compensation and
consideration .
A just, equitable and uniform
compensation or liability law
should be placed on the statute
books. The present makeshift
is not satisfactory to either era
ployer or employee. I would
favor the appointment of a joint
committee of employers and em
ployees with power to jointly
formulate such a system of laws
as would fairly and reasonably
compensate the injured em
ployee or his family in case of
death, for submission to the
legislature for proper action at
the earliest convenient time.
Fourth I will insist that all
Dublic offices of the State and
county are administered efficient
ly and economically, so that the
burden of taxation may be held
down to the minimum, and will
advocate and work for such laws
that will be the means of bring
ing about the often promised
and seldom realized economy in.
State government.
Fifth I am for supplement
ing our prohibition law by pro
per and adequate legislation, in
order that the same can and will
be effectively enforced.
Sixth I pledge my support to
the end that the Red Light
Abatement Bill, House Bill No.
4, passed by the Third State
Legislature and referred to the
voters on a referendum petition
becomes a law.
Seventh I will endeavor to
have our election laws amended
and revised in such manner that
they may be clear to all citizens,
electors and administrative of
ficials of the State.
Eighth I favor the ratifica
tion of the Constitutional Amend
ments by our State of the Nation-wide
Prohibition and Wo
man's Suffrage Laws.
Ninth I am for a continua
tion of our State highway sys
tem and additional good roads.
Will also insist that the Federal
government build a system of
good roads along the southern.
boundary of the State, the same
being in my judgment a vital
military necessity for our pres
ent and future protection.
I believe that the full authori
ty of the legislative and execu
tive branches of the State gov
ernment should be exercised in
the enactment and enforcement
of adequate laws for the pro
tection of life and property
along the Mexican border.
Tenth I favor continued and
adequate appropriations for the
maintainance of the public
schools and institutions of the
State, in order to keep them up
to the highest standard. Rea
lizing our-total unpreparedness
when entering this greatest of
all wars, and knowing the ne
cessity aad importance of spe
cialized training and advantages
of same, I am in favor of addi
tional appropriations and reve
nues for our schools in order
that we may give our boys and
girls vocational, industrial and
military training of the highest
order.
Eleventh AsCommissioner to
the State Land Department, I
have endeavored to secure for
the State the greatest amount
of revenue consistent with good
business policy in the leasing
and sale of the State and insti
tutional lands. My report to
the State Land Department will
show the results achieved and I
feel a great pride in this De
partment of the State, and am
in favor of a continuation of the
present broad constructive land
policy.
Twelfth I am for legislation
that will deal effectively with
those people who in any way
hamper or hinder our industrial,
military and financial efforts to
speedily and effectively prose
cute the war. There should be
no temporizing or half-way
measures. Our soldiers are in
the trenches offering their lives
for a great and noble cause, and
we should, as individuals and
officials, see that nothing is left
undone and that there is no in
terference in our efforts to back
them up to the limit with our
moral, financial and physical
forces and insure a speedy and
complete victory.
I am heartily in favor of legis
lation extending the franchise
to electors of the State of Ari
zona, wherever they may be
stationed.
I submit the above for your
earnest consideration and ask
your support.
Respectfully, W. A. Moeur.

WORK OR FIGHT.
Baseball Players and Other Young
Men Must do Their Bit.
A telegram from Washington,
last Thursday says:
"Unlimited power to draft men
within the ages prescribed by
the selective service act were
granted to Secretary of War
Baker this afternoon by the
house military affairs committee.
"The committee adopted an
amendment to the military bill
allowing the president to take
any number of men in any fiscal
year under the present draft
law, observing the order of class
ification. "During the day Provost Mar
shal General Crowder issued a
statement that all men under
draft must, work or light. Un
less these seek laborious em
ployment, they will be taken in
the next few drafts. The order
is expected to affect about 7"0,
000 men.
"As one result, it is expected
that the baseball players of the
entire country, coming under the
draft, will be forced to go to
work or serve in the army, and
that the life of baseball will
probably be very short."
MUST REGISTER ON JUNE 5.
Secretary Arcus Reddoch of
the local draft board has receiv
ed the following telegram from
Adjt. Gen. Charles W. Harris.
"The act providing for the
registration of men who have
become 21 years of age since
June 5 last has been passed by
congress, and proclamation by
the President will be issued
shortly naming June 5 next as
the day for registration. Ad
vise all boards accordingly and
instruct all local boards to give
widest publicity through all
newspapers of the date of re
gistration, and give publicity
through your own channels. It
is very important that news
papers give as much publicity
as possible to the fact that June
5, 1918, is the day when all men
who have become 21 years of
age since last registration day
must register."
The public resolution approv
ed by congress which provides
for this registration contains the
following provision:
"That during the present em
ergency all made persons citi
zens of the United States, and
all male persons residing in the
United States, who have, since
June 5, 1917, and on or before
the day set for the registration
by proclamation by the presi
dent, attained the age of 21
years, shall be subject to regis
tration in accordance with re
gulations to be prescribed by the
president, stating the time and
place of such registration, it
shall be the duty of all such per
sons, except such persons as are
exempt from registration under
the act of May 18, 1917, and any
act or acts amendatory thereof,
to present themselves for and
submit to registration under the
provisions of said act approved
May 18, 1917, and they shall be
registered in the same manner
subject to the same requirements
and liabilities as those previous
ly registered under the provi
sions of this act shall be placed
at the bottom of the list of those
liable for military service in the
several classes to which they
are assigned, under such rules
and regulations as the president
may prescribe."
