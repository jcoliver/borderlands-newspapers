ASK PRESIDENT WILSON'S AID
Governor Campbell and Others Send
Message to Chief Executive.
A recent press dispatch from
Phoenix says:
"The most stupendous oppor
tunity in the world for rapid in
crease in population through the
reclamation of two million acres
of desert land in Arizona, Cali
fornia and Nevada," is the key
note of a telegram sent today to
President Wilson to enlist his
aid in the project by Governor
Campbell and others who have
been working on the scheme.
The telegram said:
"Arizona and the arid west
earnestly support appropriations
for soldier settlement and will
be deeply grateful for your aid.
Under the Roosevelt reservoir
annual production is now more
than twenty five million dollars,
twice the total investment of the
national government in project.
Additional Arizona irrigation
projects suitable for soldier set
tlement already approved for
construction, if built, would
treble this production and enor
mously enlarge markets for thj
eastern manufacturers. This
production would be again more
than doubled if flood .waters
were saved and flow of Gila
river and tributaries standardiz
ed regulating works on water
sheds as contemplated in New-
lands plan and Olmstead report.
Colorado River below Grand
Canyon is the Nile of America.
Another Egypt could be there
created. This most stupendous
opportunity in the world for
rapid increase of population with
immtense purchasing power

lion acres desert iand in A rizona,
California and Nevada by irri
gation, including pumping with
electric power. Two hundred
thousand horsepower could be
developed in Pyramid Canyon
and transmitted for pumping.
mining, manufacturing and ope
rating railroads within circle
reaching Phoenix, Mesa, San
Diego, Los Angeles, Bakers
field, Goldfield, Tonopah and
mining regions of southwestern
Utah and Arizona. This great
project would transfer to con
quest of desert national ener
gies heretofore devoted to war,
obviate disemployment and pre
vent industrial depression.
The message to the president
was signed by the following:
Thomas E. Campbell, Gover
nor of Arizona; Joseph E. Lof
tus, chairman of the State Sol
diers' Settlement Committee;
Andrew Kimball, agricultural
agent, railroad administration;
Henry A. Diehl, president Ari
zona Merchants' Association; P.
H. Engden, president Merchants
and Manufacturers' Association;
H. V. Asbnry, president of the
Phoenix Chamber of Commerce,

DAM WILL BE' COMPLETED.
Rranr.is J. Salufi has been se
cured by the state loan board to
take charge of the Lyman dam
nroiect for the state. Salue is
the man who had charge of the
Laguna project and the Colorado
river levees. He is now on the
way to St. Johns.
The first big job of the new
engineer will be to get rid of the
miles of ice, 14 inches thick,
with which the Little Colorado
is covered above the dam, in
such a way as to avoid its piling
up and destroying the work al
ready done. The dam footings
are in, and enough fill is in place
to hold about ten feet of water.
The original cost of the Ly
man dam project was estimated
at $150,000, ot which the state
loaned 120,000, taking a first
mortgage on the 15,000 acres
under the project. Recent in
vestigation by R. S. Cooking
ham of Prescott, sent to investi
gate the matter, showed that it
will cost about $100,000 more
than the original estimate, owing
to the increased cost of labor,
material and machinery, and of
this the state will probably loan
$80,000 additional, the Lyman
company and the farmers put
ting up the remainder. The
land board will, it is said, re
commend the loan. Messenger.

Items of Interest Culled From Our

The abundance of rains which
have fallen over the ranges of
Southern Arizona during the
lastjfew weeks will insure plenty
of spring feed, says the Cattle
man of Tucson.
A petition urging that the
state legislature pass the bill to
permit ten round boxing exhi
bitions, is being circulated in
Bisbee. It is the contention of
those who are circulating the
petitions, that the returning sol
diers and sailors of this state
wiil need recreation of some sort
and that boxing in a mild form
should be allowed.
The federal house has passed
the war minerals relief measure,
under which about 150 Arizona
men will be beneficially affected,
according to announcement by
J. E. Curry, secretary ' of the
Arizona chapter of the Ameri
can Mining Congress. The bill
proposes to reimburse those men
who at the suggestion of the
war department, set about the
development of manganese and
other minerals of which the
government stood so much in
need for war purposes. Before
the stage of production had been
reached the emergency was de
clared passed.
Fifty business houses, of El
Paso, Texas, have agreed to
make the proposed chamber of
commerce trade excursion trip
thru Arizona and New Mexico
in April, it was announced at
a recent meeting of the El Paso
chamber of Commerce. It is
proposes to make a swing around
the circle of the two states, visit
ing the principle citities. A
side trip to Sonora through No
gales, Arizona, is also being con
sidered,, but nothing has been
decided upon this feature of the
trip. A military band and a
quartet will accompany the busi
ness men. The itinerary is now
being prepared by the traffic de
partment of the chamber of
commerce.
MR. WILSON'S TRIUMPH.
Americans who regretted the
President's decision to absent
himself from the country in
these days of domestic need and
urgency, and the Times was one
of those which regretted it, will
not only cheerfully admit the
greatness of his schievements at
the Paris Conference, but will
rejoice in their recognition of
his now amply demonstrated fit
ness for the work he undertook.
Mr. Wilson's presence at the
Conference has not been a cause
of discord or of jealousy; it has
not been resented. It was seen
from the beginning that he went
there not to dominate, as his
critics said, but to unite the na
tions. He has been marvelous
ly successful in bringing into
agreement men who represented
interests that seemed to be con
flicting. His influence in this
work has prevailed because all
the other nations represented
looked upon him as a wise and
impartial friend, interested only
in making justice and the wel
fare of peoples the basis of the
decisions reached. His triumph
in securing unanimous approval
of the league of naticros constitu
tion is one in which every Amer
ican may take pride.
Mr. Wilson has a dreadful way
with his critics. He does not
reply to them, he does worse.
They rail at him as an idealist,
a visionary, a man without prac
tical objectives, or if he have
them, that they are impossible
of acceptance; and they oblig
ingly point out the things he
ought to do. Mr. Wilson calmly
continues his great labors, and
presently lays his critics flat and
leaves them helpless either by
doing the very things they had
proposed, and doing in a manner
better than they ever dreamed
of, or else by attaining his ends
in a way that robs their objec
tions of every point. We are
confident that Mr. Beck, for in
stance, must regret the violence
of the language he used in his
Lincoln Day address when he
said that Mr. Wilson's foreign
IMjlicy throughout "has been a
black stain of dishonor upon the
American people;" that "his
principles have been a crazy
patchwork of contradictions,"
consistent only in one idea, that
the war "must end in a peace
without victory." If this be just
criticism, then Mr. Wilson has
as his accomplices in dishonor
ing the American people, in con
structing "his crazy patchwork
of contradictions," and in bring
ing the war to an end without
victory, some fourteen nations
of the earth, including the
greatest civilized nations. Such
criticism recoils disastrously up
on him who utters it. Not even
the natural desire $f a great
political party to find or create
"issues" for the coming presi
dential election can give lodg
ment in the minds and hearts of
the people to this estimate of
Mr. Wilson's distinguished ser
vice. The day when the project of
the covenant of peace was ap
proved unanimously in Paris was
one of the greatest in the world's
history. The people of all the
nations understand that; the
people of America, with their
horror of war, cannot be fooled
about it, they cannot bs misled
into any small and narrow view
of its momentous promise. In
bringing the plan of the league
into form and acceptance, Mr.
Wilson has played a master role,
every American feels that in his
heart, every American under
stands that he brought great
abilities, extraordinary qualities
of tact and persuasion, and a
profound understanding of. the
need of all the peoples to the
performance of his task'. The
American people will be impa
tient of any petty or partisan
obstruction put in the way of
the acceptance of this covenant
of the nations as their pubhc
system of law and justice. New
York-Times.
WINS SUIT AGAINST BISBEE.
A verdict for $7,500 was ren
dered by a jury in the superior
court in this city yesterday af
ternoon in favor of Louis Time,
a returned soldier, against the
city of 'Bisbee. Time sued for
$10,000 damages on account of
injuries claimed to have been
caused by his falling into an un
protected areaway in Bisbee.
He sustained a broken hip,
which caused a- shortening of
one of the legs.
The case was started on Wed
nesday and was given to the
jury at noon yesterday. The
jury was out three and one half
hours and brought in a verdict
of $7,500 signed by ten of the
jurors, two of the jurymen re
fusing to sign the verdict.

MISLEADING REPORTS.
A number of workmen have
arrived in Patagonia during the
past week, coming as a result of
the rather sensational and over
drawn reports concerning the
mining industry of this section
appearing in outside newspap
ers. The Patagonia mining indus
try is in a prosperous condition,
but upon the authority of pro
minent operators it can be stated
there is no shortage of labor.
It is a great injustice to
the workmen to be misled by
unreliable reports and upon ar
riving here, after a "hike" of 50
miles or more to find his ser
vices are not required. Pata
gonian. ARIZONA WAR STAMP QUOTA
Arizona must raise $2,503,600

MEN ABOVE PARTY POLITICS
Towering above the small
Americans as represented by
senators who oppose the league
of nations, stands Wm. Howard
Taft, our ex-president. His
stature in Americanism might be
compared to the tall sycamore
while the bellyachers look like
crabapple trees. Rising to an
atmosphere above party politics,
Mr. Taft and other patriotic men
who vote the republican ticket,
are standing squarely with Mr.
Wilson, our president, who re
presents the Nation and hot a
faction or party, seeking prefer
ment by the presidential or other
political route.
The most momentous question
of the present day is that of pro
viding for universal peace. That
is what our soldiers and those
of the allies fought for, and it is
what the liberty loving men and
women of American and all civil
ized nations demand.
Of course the draft of the
league of nations is not perfect,
it is only an outline, backed by
the good will and desires of
civilization. It is not to have a
big fighting force, rather the
power will be moral and econo
mic but this will, if necessary,
be backed by voluntary force.
There has never been a per
fect plan or constitution adopt
ed. It took seventy-five years
to make the United States a na
tion, although we had an ex
cellent constitution.
National and state constitu
tions are subject to amendment
as weakness is shown or new
conditions are presented. So it
will be with the league of na
tions. But a beginning has been
made and it is a long step to
ward peace.
Action of little Americans in
the senate reminds one of athe
ists and those who scoff at the
Bible, yet they would destroy a
good structure and be unable to
supply something in its stead.
No one has a right to tear down
unless he can build greater.
Last Sunday Mr. Taft said in
part:
"United as never before, our
people have fought this war.
United and above party, we
must consider the problems of
peace, resolved that, so far as
in us lies, war shall no more
scourge mankind.
"The covenant reported to the
Paris conference has come since
the last election, and the people
have had no chance to pass
judgment upon it. Id this jour
ney from coast to coast, we have
looked into the faces of more
than 100,000 typical Americans,
and believe that the great ma
jority of our countrymen desire
to take part in such a league as
is proposed in that document.
We appeal to our fellow citizens,
therefore, to study earnestly
this question and express their
opinions with a voice so clear
and strong that our represent
atives in congress may know
that the people of the United
States are determined to assume
their part in this crisis of human
history.
"The alternative to a league
of nations is a heavy burden and
the constant temptation of un
iversal armament."

You can tear out your corns and suf

painless way la the world. Two drops
"Get tho Drop" on That Corn Use "Get-Ie"
and the Corn Is a Goner I
of "Gets-It" on any corn or callus dries
t once. The corn finally loosens off
from tho too, so that you can peel it
oft with, your fingers in o no piece, pain
lessly, like peeling a banana. "Great
stuff, wish I'd done that before." There's
only one corn-peeler "Gets-It." Toes
wrapped up big with tape and band
ages, toes sauirming from irritating
salves, it's all a barbarity. Toes wounded
by razors and knives, that's butchery,
ridiculous, unnecessary, dangerous. Use
"Gets-It," the liberty way simple,
painless, always sure. Take no chances.
Get "Gets -It." Don't be insulted by
Imitations. See that you get "Gets-It."
"Gets-It," the guaranteed, money

Do you feel weak, diz

lack of good health caused
from any of the com

give Cardui a trial? It
should surely do for you
what it has done for so
many thousands of other

should help you back to

Ask some lady friend
