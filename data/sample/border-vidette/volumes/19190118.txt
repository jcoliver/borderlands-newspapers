The Spirit of Friendship,
This store looks upon its patrons not
merely as customers but as friends.
People purchase here because they
have friendly feeling for this store.
The cause which develops this friendly
feeling, may differ', in fact, they are
sure to differ. One's friendship for
the store is the result of finding good
values; another's is the result of effi
cient service and courteous-treatment,
and so on.
Naturally this friendshiply feeling on
the part of our patrons is reciprocated
on our part. And this spirit of mutual
friendship is an impetus for greater
service and an incentive to ever-increasing
endeavor to make this store
a place where every visitor will feel
perfectly at home.

The Morning Glory has taken
out some high grade silver ore,
which was sacked and hauJpd to
the loading platform at Pata
gonia for shipment to the smel
ter. W. A. Prege, the old-time
Dragoon cattleman, has been in
Tucson several days looking
over the cattle situation prepar
atory to doing some heavy buy
ing this spring.
Twenty eight inches of snow
is the report from Alpine. Guess
that will make it some wet later
on, which makes a pieasing out
look for farmers and stockmen.

Phoenix is a blaze of lights,
following the lifting of the in
fluenza ban. The opening of the
city followed a decision in the
superior court that the closing
ordinance was unconstitutional.
The Pierce Gardner property
is still improving, and it looks
like the best mining proposition
in the Harshaw district. The
lessees have had some very
nattering offers for the property,
but have refused all of them.
Bulletin No. 84, Dry Farming
in Arizona" has just been issued
by the Agricultural Experiment
Station of the University of Ari
zona. This publication is by C.
R. Fillerup and L L. Bates, and
edited and revised by H. C.
Heard. Copies may be obtained
on application to the Agricult

The Santa Nina mine has been
closed down, ow'ng to the fact
that all the ore has been ex
traded from the property. The
machinery has been dismantled
and will be shipped to Miami.
The Miami Copper Co. owns the
Santa Nina, having purchased
it some time ago for 35,000.
The ore body was a deposit in
solid granite Patagonian.
Aerial transportation, long the
dream of aviators and manufac
turers of airplanes, is to be in
augurated in Phoenix within the
course of theLnext two months.
A company has been organized
for this purpose, secured the
initial machine and made ar
rangemfnts to begin operation
within 60 days. The terminal
points will be Phoenix and
Globe,
Nc for 25 years has Texas
faced brighter crop prospects at
the beginning of the new year
than at present as a result of
rains and snows of the last two
weeks, and despite the recent
extremely cold weather, the only
possible ill effects will be the
difficulties of feeding livestock
in the extreme northern Pan
handle district where the ground
for two weeks has been covered
with snow.
After listening to discussions
of every angle of the livestock
situation in the state, and fully
investigating the conditions un
der which the livestock industry
will be carried on this year, the
state tax commission, in its
meeting with county and city
assessors from all parts of the
state, decided to retain last
year's assessment valuation on
cattle and sheep for this year.
The decision was reached after
it had been decided that the in
dustry would be as financially
steady arfd safe during 1919 as
it has been during 1918.
A readjustment of the work
in dairying at the University of
Arizona and the Agricultural
Experiment Station has been
made, and a separate Dairy De
partment has been created fin
der the direction of W. S. Cun
ningham, Dairy Husbandman.
This arrangement will make pos
sible greater specialization in
dairy work, as Prof. Cunning
ham's attention, which formerly
was divided among various other
lines of live stock .-work, can
now be given entirely to dairy
ing and dairy interests. More
attention also will be given to
experimental work in dairying,
and it is hoped that a dairying
unit may be established on the
Mesa Experiment Station Farm
in the near future.
A DIFERENCE.
President Wilson a Paris, in
reaffirming Lis position in favor
of a League of Nations, took
occasion also to deny that he
had ever, "directly or indirect
ly," indorsed '"the particnlai
plan of the League to Enforce
Peace."
There is a distinction here
which is important. Confusion
is inevitable if it is not clearly
observed. A league to "enforce"
peace presupposes a union am
ong nations so close that each
one surrenders some part of its
essential sovereignty to estab
lisb a common power greater
than that of any single member
of the union. Thus have the
States of the American Union
acted and have had to act to
"enforce" peace among them
selves. Thus do individuals
within a State act to "enforce"
law and order and peace among
themselves.
But President Wilson's League
o? Nations is something evident
ly different and more practical.
It is no more impossible to es
tablish such a league, openly
expressing, the mutual obliga
tions and purposes of its mem
bers, than it has been to estab
lish the limited alliances with
which the war began in Europe,
secretly expressing their mutual
obligations and purposes.
More than this. Without such
a League ol Nations as the Pre
sident has in mind, nothing will
have been or can be won from
the great war as against future
wars, and the" world will come
out of its unprecedented sacri
fides of life and treasure exactly
where it began. No question
vitally related to an enduring
peace can be made worth a mo
meut's serious discussion. No
principle or policy to that end
can bd given practical force.
How otherwise is this end of
an enduring peace to be achiev

CATTLEMEN WANT WIRE FENCE
Approximately $200,000 worth
of cattle have been "lost, stray
ed or stolen" from Pima county
ranches since the beginning of
revolutionary troubles in Mexi
co, in 1910, it is estimated by J.
M. Ronstadt, prominent cattle
man of Tucson. He estimates
that 5,000 is a conservative esti
mate of the cattle which have
been lost to Pima county ranch-
ers through their straying over
the international line, where,
owing to conditions south of the
line and the difficulty of inter
national negotiations, it has been
impossible to regain possession.
This costly "leak" will be
stopped or decreased by the
erection of a wire fence along
that part of the international,
line that is bordered by the
Papago Indian reservation, a
distance of approximately fifty
miles, which was recently au
thorized by the indian service.
Ten thousand dollars was ap
propriated for the fencing.
The authorization of the erec
tion of the fence was secured by
the Arizona Cattle Growers asso
ciation and the Southwestern
Cattle Growers' association, both
of which passed resolutions ask
ing Senators Ashurst and Smith
to urge the erection of the fence.
It is likely that the cattlemen's
association will ask other gov
ernment agencies to extend the
fence along the border to the
east and the west of the reser
vation fence for the protection
of the ranches of New Mexico,
Texas and the country to the
west of the reservation.
The recovery of the cattle
which have strajed from Ari
zona ranches to Sonora has been
a difficult undertaking, necessi
tating the assistance of the state
and treasury departments at
Washington and other govern
ment agencies, to say nothing of
the assistance of Mexican fed
eral and state authorities.
N. R- Vail of Los Angeles,
general manager of the Vail
Company, is spending two or
three days in Tucson on busi
ness. Accompanied by W. B.
Vail, he left last Saturday evem
ing lor the company's ranches
in the southeastern end of the
county. Cattleman.
WOULD RE-IMBURSfc. AMERICANS
Senator Ashurst of Arizona Intro
duces Resolution in Senate.
Senator Ashurst of Arizona
has introduced the following
resolution in the senate, which
was referrtd to the committee
on military affairs:
"Joint Resolution Directing
the secretary of war to investi
gate the claims of those citizens
of the United States who, since
December 1, 191 2,suffered dama
ges to person or property by
acts of violence committed by
Mexican outlaw, revolutionary,
insurgent or federal forces.
"Resolved by the Senate and
House of Representatives of the
United States of America in
Congress assembled, That the
Secretary of War be, and he is
hereby authorized and directed
to make, or cause to be made
under his direction, a full and
thorough investigation of each
and all claims of citizens of the
United States (which may be
called to his at'ention by claim
ants or their attorneys, heirs, or
personal repre-entatives) for re
imbursements and damages for
injuries inflicted by Mexican out
law. revolutionary, insurgent, or
federal forces since December
1, 1912, upon the person or to
the property of sucti claimants.
"For the purpose of such in
vestigation the secretary of war
is authorized to appoint a com
mission of three officers of the
army, one of whom shall be an
inspector general. Such com
mission shall have authority to
subpoena witnesses, administer
oaths, and to takevidence on

hereby empowered and directed
to mitke all orders and issue all
processes necessary for that
purpose, and said commission
shall have all the powers con
ferred by law upon inspectors
general army of the United
States army in the performance
of their duties. Such commis
sion shall report to congress,
through the secretary of war,
as soon as practicable, its find
ings of fact upon each .and .ll
claims presented to it 'and its
conclusions as to the justice and
equity thereof and as to the,
proper amount of compensation
or indemnity thereupon."
LARGE
INCREASE IN RECEIPTS
Showing an increase of re
ceipts from 13 842.57 in 1913,
to 19,032.79 in 1918, during the
seven years of his occupancy,
the final report of Sidney P. O
born, secretary of state, has re
cently been filed.
In motor vehicle licenses there
also has been a corresponding
increase, there being but 5040
issued by Secretary of State
Osborn in 1914 and 23905 in the
year just passed. The distribu
tion of the motor vehicle licenses
for 1918 is as follows:
Apache, 254; Cochise, 3621;
Coconino, 533; Gila, 211; Gra
ham, 614; Greenlee, 24. Mari
copa, 8340; Mohave, 757; Navajo,
574; Pima, 1574; Pinal, 850; San
ta Cruz, 732; Yavapai, 1906; Yu
ma, 1327.
MOTOR CAR TAGS DELAYED.
Motor car owners who have
made application for their 1919
license tags and who have not
yet received them, will have to
be patient, according to a state
ment issued by Secretary of
State Mit Simms. Congestion
in the office room at the state
house, due to the incoming
legislature, has delayed the
work of getting out the license
tags somewhat.
Persons who have filed their
applications will receive their
number tags as soon as it is
possible for the secretary's office
to send them out. The tags are
being sent forward by parcel
post and car owners who have
not yet received their tags ntvd
no' make application a second
time.
'CEASE KNITTING.
This order has gone out from
Red Cross headquarters to the
3.854 chapters of the organiza
tion. As a result thousands of
women who have turned out vast
quantities of sweaters, socks,
mufflers, helmelts and wristlets
for our soldiers and sailors will
stack their needles. There is a
sufficient quantity in resewe at
Red Cross division and camp
warehouses to meet the needs of
America's fighting men in this
country and Europe, and those
of the Red Cross commissions
engaged in civilian relief work
abroad .
Knitted articles now in pro
cess of construction are to be
completed as rapidly as possible
and turned in to chapters, which
in turn will ship them to the
division warehouse in San Fran
Cisco. No more yarn is to be
issued to workers.
More than 10,000,000 knitted
articles were turned out by Red
Cross workers in the seventeen
months preceding the signing of
the armistice.
BIG INCREASE IN RANGECATTLE
From the U. S. Forest Service
at Albuquerque come the state
ment that there has been a re
markable increase in range cat
tle in New Mexico and Arizona
since the entry of the United
States into the war.
Two years ago the forest ser
vice sent experts into the na
tional forests of the two states
to locate unused areas suitable
for giazing. Many areas were
located. A large part of them,
however, were small or so cut
up that they were not of use for
new herds. This difficulty was
overcome by the extension of
grazing permits to cattlemen al
ready holding them.
In the two. years since the
survey was made the increase
in cattle on national forests is
more than 65,000 head. The
output of sheep and goats has
been increased by at least 60,000
head.

look forward to the rehabilitation of
the European meat herds. The policy
which guided our meat program in the
past year has been fully justified, for
only the heavy pork production which
It has brought about will enable oh
even partly to satisfy the increased
demands on us for the coming year.
There will be a world shortage in fats,
and it is to the United -States that Eu
rope must look to supply its deficien
cy. At the same time there will conT
tlnue to be heavy demnnds for beef.
Owing to the'limlted refrigerator ship
ping capacity European imports of
beef for some time will be limited.
The United States, Australia and
Argentine will be able to maintain a
supply that will keep all available
freezer vessels operating at capacity.
