Sidney P. Osborn for Business Method
From the battle fields in France
there comes an unspoken call
that should find an answer in
every American's heart. The
recent great events in Europe,
the successes of American arms
on the fields of France should
spur every American to greater
effort.
Our people at home should not
rest on the laurels of our sol
diers in France. Every death
on the field of honor in the line
of duty and for our country's
cause should be a call to us for
every sacrifice and every exer
tion to aid the cause for which
our soldiers are fighting, for
which our soldiers have died.
Increase production, decrease
consumption, save, and lend to
the Government. Every cent
lent to the United States is used
to support, strengthen, and aid
our soldiers in Fiance. Miner.
The ol idea that a public of
fice is a chattle to be baudied
hither and yon with each elec
tion is rapidly giving way to the
more sane application of the
elementary rules of ordinary
business' which declare that a
man who knows his trade and
can secure the best results is
the man to retain.
The business of running the
state of Arizona is a big job. It
requires knowledge of conditions
and people; keen business in
sight, and ability of a high or
der. The business manager (gov
ernor) of a state must be a close
buyer and a clever salesman.
He must see to it that his boss
(the people) are fully protected.
If he attends to the business of
the job he will have little time
to waste on building political
fences and developing personal
gradues.
According to the propaganda
being issued by Sidney P. Os
born, who wants to be governor
of Arizona, one of the chief re
asons why he should be nomin
ated at the September primaries
is because he "has been asso
ciated with the conduct of the
state of Arizona ever since it
has been a state and before. He
was a member of the Constitu
tional Convention which framed
the magna charter under which
we are now living. He was born
and reared in the state. He
knows it and he knows its needs
and its people. He has been
secretary of state, and acting
governor. He has shown him
self a capable executive, and has
specialized in the very things
most needed to give the people
of the state a business adminis
tration."
This, of course, is political
argument, and is intended to in
fluence votes.
"But," Osborn concludes his
appeal, "isn't it the truth?''
ARIZONA ON THE FIRING LINE.
The dispatches from France
indicate the presence of the 89th
Division in one of the American
army corps on the firing line.
One of the units of this division,
the 340th Field Artillery, train
ed at Camp Funston, is com
posed largely of Arizona men,
the first to be called in the
drafts.
When the 340th Field Artillery
goes into action, it will be -the
first unit composed of Arizona
men in any considerable number
to get into the fighting. The
boys from Arizona in this re
giment are splendid typs of Am
erican manhood and like their
fellows who have already won
undying glory in France, can be
counted upon to give a good ac
count of themselves when they
meet the Hun. It is quiet pro
bable that they already have
been engaged in the fighting be
tween Soissons and Rheiras.
The casualty lists will tell for
the lists are lengthening daily
and Arizona cannot hope to es
cape. The presence of the Arizona
boys on the scene of the fiercest
fighting of the war and the
sacrifices which they must make,
cannot but bring the war closer
home to all. And while we glory
in the splend'd victories of our
arms, many a home here in the
west will be thrown into sorrow,
that the flag may press forward.
Arizona, the youngest state in
the union, is represented in
every branch of the service. Al
ready the dispatches have told
of the exploits of some of her
sons in the air and as America
throws day by day more of her
men into the fighting, Arizona's
part will become daily greater.
We were all confident of what
the Americans could do. But
since the recent fighting we
know and when the Arizona
boys go through the baptism of
fire, the Huns will be flying be
fore them. Tucson Citizen.

There's a big American story
in the daily casualty list if you
read behind the names.
What is an American? What's
in a name?.
In one day's list you find Hos
kins, Kohlmeier, Maciejewski,
Nowanty, Perry, Sullivan, Ver
doukas, Bergman, Laughlin,
Beckerle, Doering, Kanski, Mur
phy, Sparks, Villoto, Ezyperki,
Cooper, Hutchinsoa, Foohey,
McCue, Schwartz, Stone, Patter
son, Thomas, Brown, Farrell,
Maximovich, Moriarity, Walton,
Knutson, and so on.
Now read behind the names:
Figure out where the ancestors
of those American boys came
from. We can't tell what coun
tries contributed their blood
through the female line, but in
the male line their is evidence
of Irish, German, Polish, Rus
sian, Greek, English, Scandina
vian and Italian blood.
Yet everyone of these soldiers
is an American fighting under
the Stars and Stripes.
We have read about the Indian
scouts with Pershing's army.
They come of the only original
American race. After Columbus
came the Spaniards, the English,
the Dutch, the Irish, the Ger
mans, the French, the Italians,
the Poles, the Hungarians, the
Russians and others.
All contributed their blood.
All went into the great melting
pot to come out as Americans
the Americans of whom all of us
now are so proud.
It ought to prove to the world
that what happened in America,
may just as well happen in Eu
rope that if the arbitrary and
artificial boundaries made by
foolish, greedy kings and kais
ers and czars were blotted out
there could be a new European
race of brothers who could dwell
together in comparative peace
and harmony.
But first, we must help the
people over there. All of them
to get rid of their autocrats so
that over there as well as over
here there can be government of
the people, by the people aad
for the people. - -Guardian.

W. A. MOEUR RETIRES.
Popular Democratic Candidate for
Governor Wants Party Harmony.
Hon. W. A. Moeur, state land
commissioner, has withdrawn
from the Democratic primary
race, for the sake of party har
mony, and has made the follow
ing statement:
Phoenix, Ariz., Aug. 14, 1918.
To my Democratic Friends:
I take this moans of announc
ing my withdrawal from the con
test for the democratic nomina
tion for governor and of giving
in brief my reasons therefor.
This step is taken only after
the most careful and most con
scientious deliberation, and is
based upon no personal con
sideration. I am a democrat, a
true believer in the genuine de
mocratic faith with the best in
terest of the democratic party at
heart. As such, I am convinced
that under existing circumstan
ces the best interest of the party
and of the state and nation will
be subserved by my withdrawal.
The contest has assumed an as
pect which bodes ill for demo
cratic harmony following the
primary, and for democratic suc
cess at the polls. Even assum
ing that democratic, loyalty and
the preponderating democratic
strength in the state might after
all prevail, a persistent question
and reasonable doubt has arisen
as to the genuineness of the so
called democratic administration
which would follow, on one hand,
POLITICAL ANNOUNCEMENTS.
FOR STATE SENATOR
The undersigned hereby an
nounces himself as a candidate
for the nomination for State
Senator from Santa Cruz coun
ty, Arizona, upon the Demo
cratic ticket, at the primary
election next fall,
adv. Tiiom.vs P. Thompson.
For the Corporation Commission
I hereby announce my candi
dacy for member of the Arizona
Corporation Commission, subject

primaries, September 10, 1918.

or as to its capableness and effi
ciency on the other. If I can
aid in the relieving of this sit
uation, and assist by my with
drawal in giving assurance that
Arizona's all'dirs will be adminis
tered during the coming two
years by a capable, trustworthy,
genuinely democratic democrat,
upon whom all true democrats
can unite and in whom all true
Arizonians can take pride, I
shall be well repaid for the
sacrifice of my personal ambi
tions. With this object in view, I
shall give my cordial and un
divided support to Hon. Sidney
P. Osborn. It is my earnest be
lief that upon him the party can
unite as it can upon no other
candidate and that under his
direction the affairs of the state
will be administered with far
trreater efticiencv than would be
! the case were they to be entrust
ed to any other aspirant. It is
true that Mr. Osborn will not be
able to make the liberal use of
funds in this campaign that dis
tinguishes the efforts of ids
opponents, but I feel sure that
conlitlence in his ability, his sin
cerity, and above all in his de
mocracy, will not suffer by re
ason thereof.
I wish to most heartily thank
my friends who have so un
selfishly and loyally supported
me. You shall all have a warm
place in my heart as long as my
days shall run. And you may
rest assured that I would not
take the step I have were I not
profoundly convinced that it is
vital to the ultimate and lasting
success of the democratic party
in Arizona; to the triumph of
genuinely democratic principle,
and to the public welfare of this
state.
Yours for democratic unity,
W. A. MOKI'R.
