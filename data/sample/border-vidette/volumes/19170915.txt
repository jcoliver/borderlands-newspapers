A telephone toll line from Pa

A delegation of capitalists,
mine owners and laboring men

Reports from Washington to
the district forest office indicate
that the 10th reserve engineers,
better known as the forestry

fourteen hundred men, it has 125
forest rangers and lumberjacks
from New Mexico and Arizona.
The relapse of Benson from a
prosperous town into a whistling
post on a blind siding seems
quite a long way Off yet, not
withstand predictions to that
effect by the pessimistic. On
the contrary the railroad com

its property here and seems
more intent on building up than
tearing down.
M. J. H. Getzwiller, who made
a call on the Signal Tuesday,
confirms the good report of cat
tlemen generally that range con

doing unusually well. He says
the range is better than in the
past seven years and that there
will be a nice lot of fat cattle
ready for marketing this fall.

According to a statement giv
en out by Secretary of State
Sidney Osborn, there were 18,
191 automobile licenses issued in
the state up to the 1st of Sep

more than 800 more machine in
Cochise county this year than
there were last.
The catalog and premium list

contains, beside the premium
list of all departments, all the
necessary information for the

the making of entries, to whom
to report, when, where and all
about it.
That there will be a- building
boom in Kingman within the
next few months is the belief of
contractors and dealers in con
struction materials. There has
been a steady improvement in
the building line the last eight
months, and those in close touch
with the situation, are confident
that an even greater increase
will be shown between now aud
next spring.
Mr. and Mrs. ft. N. Keaton
were camped a few days early
this week at the Monkey springs
on O. P. Ashburn's ranch, where
Mrs. Keaton took the baths for
rheumatic trouble. While there
Mr. Keaton killed a snake which
had swallowed a catfish, the
head of which was almost twice
as large as the head of the
snake, and the horn or fin of the
fish was protruding through the
snake's side. This may sound
like a "snake story," but we tell
the story as it was told to us.

A party of engineers have
been engaged for about three
weeks on a survey of the main
road through the county, ex
tending from the New Mexico
line near Rodeo to the Pima
cuunty line on the west. At
present they are making their
headquarters in Benson and
working this side of St. David
bridge. It is the general under
standing that'the survey is for
locating the best route for a per
manent improved' road and to
get accurate data upon which to
base the new road bond issue.

The soldiers of the First Ari
zona regiment, not-the present
First, but one organized in 1864
65, will probably be granted
pensions, though the first ap
plication for one, made by a
Mexican member of the regi
ment in; 1905, was denied under
a ruling by the secretary of the
interior at that time. A. K.
Meek, a special representative
of the pension bureau, was in
Phoenix regarding applications
made by the adjutant general in
1912 on behalf of Cheroquis and
Old Juan, Maricopa Indian
members of the regiment.
A great deal of speculation is
manifest in the fact that the
Phelps Dodge and other large
interests are going into the
Chloride district and inspecting
several properties; and in fact,
it is said, making a thorough
examination of the entire min
ing section, from several miles
north of the "Famous Tennes
see" along the range through
Mineral Park, Cerebat and Gol
conda. While there are a large
number of properties working
all along the range, the latter
part of the month will see about
twenty new ones starting up.
Ijast Saturday evening will
long be remembered by the citi
zens of Ray and especially those
who have been called to the
colors as a result of the selec
tive draft. The occasion was a
farewell dance given to the soon
departing boys by the Loyalty
League and Ray Con Club.
These two bodies were chosen
as hosts because their member
ship includes almost every per
son in town, and as this was to
be the last farewell gathering
for the boys It may truthfully be
said that every citizen in the
camp participated as host. Cop

The threatened shortage of
cotton pickers in the northern
district of Lower California has
been averted by the successful
ending of the attempt to bring
from China 500 laborers who
will arrive in time to help handle
the big crop across the border.
The satisfactory results have
been obtained through the co
operation of the United States
Department of Labor, and are
due to the persistent efforts of a
number of residents of the Im
perial Valley. About October
20, 500 Chinese will arrive in
the United States, landing at
San Francisco, and will be trans
ported by the Southern Pacific
railroad company under bond,
in sealed coaches, to Calexieo,
where they will be taken across
the Mexican boundary line and
delivered to the Ching Kong
Chung Company.
'DOING HIS BIT."
Nogales Boys Secures Data Regarding
Santa Cruz Crops.
It has just been learned
through a visit to Nogales that
not all the brave young men of
the nation are fighting at the
front the battles of the people,
for it remained for Master Bar
clay Bristol, 14 year old son of
J. B. Bristol of the Nogales
Chamber of Commerce, to set
the pace for patriotic service to
to his country.
Barclay was very much inter
ested in the program laid out by
his father relative to securing
data and information regarding
crops of Santa Cruz county and
insisced on being assigned the
duty of making a personal trip
through the valley securing ac
curate data on growing crops.
He made the trip after con
vincing his father he could
handle the job, and returned
with a complete and very ac
curate report of all crops under
cultivatiqn and the acreage of
each. This information has just
been accepted by the state coun
cil of defense as being accurate
data of the crops growing.
Barclay visited over 170 farms
in three weeks' time and cover
ed 210 miles in his trip, con
versing with more than 510 peo
ple regarding the condition cf
crops throughout the valley.
In speaking of this young
man's work, Mr. Sellers of the
state council mentioned that it
was the first case in the state
where any person has secured
such a large amount of data and
in such specific form. A young
man of this age who will volun
teer to go into strange houses
for three weeks at a time when
all the other boys are enjoying
a good time at the beach or at
home certainly is deserving of
the highest praise.
Barclay Bristol mentioned to
Mr. Sellers . that he was only
doing his duty for his country
and that he wished he could do
more. It will be well for many
of our so called patriotic citizens
to buck up a little and render a
few more hours to this volun
tary work . that is now being
carried on, as this young man
has set a very good example
that many of our people could
very well afford to follow.

CO-OPERATIVE BULL BUYING.
Oil Discovery Booms Holbrook.
The discovery cf oil and na
tural gas near Holbrook is at
tracting considerable interest
approaching the proportions of
a boom. Already five sections
of land have been staked out in
claims, and the work has only
started. Harry H. Scores, one
of the oldest residents of Hol
brook, has known of the oil and
coal indications in that vicinity
far many years.
About six months ago he in
duced experts to make investi
gation of the prospects, and
their report was so favorable
that he had other experts to
make investigation, and their
findings were also favorable.
This was followed by about
twenty claims being staked out
Pockets of gas have been found
in a number of places, and it is
no uncommon thing to find in
dications of oil near the surface.
Now that Several experts from
different oil fields have examin
ed the prospects and have re
ported favorably, active work in
prospecting will commence. Mr.
Scores states that sufficient
money is available to sink the
first well and that the work will
commence in a few days.
Two hundred thousand dollars
for the building of roads and
maintaining of schools in the
state, will be the net result of
the sale of six hundred and
thirty five million feet of west
ern yellow pine located on the
Sitgreaves National Forest in
eastern Arizona. Application for
the purchase of 235,000,000 feet
has been approved by the forest
service. The purchasers have
also applied for approximately
400,000,000 feet of adjoining
timber on White Mountain In
dian Reservation, according to a
bulletin from the district office
at Albuquertjue.
One of the best ways to breed
up cattle on the open range is
for the cattlemen in each district
to form an association and buy
bulls for the whole district.
Make an estimate of how many
bulls are needed and then assess
each cattle owner in proportion
to the number of cattle each one
has. In this way there will be
plenty of bulls of a recognized
breed on the range and. every
one will bear his just proportion
of the expenses. If some outfit
has a lot of cattle in the district
from some outside range, and
he can't or won't keep them at
home, let him also contribute
bull money in proportion to the
estimated number of cattle he
has running in the district. In
this way it would be only a short
time till the ranges would show
marked improvement in the
grade of range cattle. Cattle
National Guard Movements Suspended
National Guard movements
that cannot be completed by
September 17 will be suspended
until September 24 according to
notice served by the War De
partment upon local railroad of
ficials. The movement of the
draft contingent of 275,000 men
begins September 19 and will
last until September 23, inclu
sive and during that period there
will be a suspension of - all Na
tional Guard traffic.
Thus the railroads have two
days in which to prepare for the
draft movement, when they will
haul 55,000 men a day for five
days, and one day afterwards to
prepare for resuming National
Guard movements.
A similar interval will come
October 1 and last until October
9, during which National Guard
movements will be suspended in
favor of the draft contingent.
To Sign Desert Water Holes.
To make the desert regions of
the western part of the United
States more accessible by locat
ing their widely separated water
ing places and erecting hundreds
of signposts to give directions
and distances to the watering
places, is an interesting and
practical project recently under
taken by the United States Geo
logical Survey, Department of
the Interior.
The project involves also the
work of making accurate maps
showing the location of the
watering places, of preparing
guides describing them and giv
ing distances between them, of
selecting well sites and of de
veloping watering places (so far
as money available will permit)
in localities where the geologic
al investigations indicate that
underground supplies can be
obtained. It is expected that
this work will help to expedite
the discovery and development
of the rich mineral deposits in
parts of these regions.

THE FLAG.
A thoughtful mind, when it
sees a nation's, flag sees not the
flap only, but the nation itself,
and, whatever may be its sym
bols, its insignia, it reads chiefly
in the flag the government, the
principles, the truths, the his
tory which belong to the nation
that sets it forth.
This nation has a banner and
wherever it streamed abroad
men saw daybreak bursting on
their eyes, lor the American Hag
has been the symbol of liberty
and men rejoice In it. Not an
other Hag on the globe has an
errand or went forth on the sea
carrying everywhere the world
around such hope for the cap
tive and such glorious tidings.
The stars upon it were to the
pining nations like the morning
stars of God, and the stripes
upon it were the beams of morn
ing light. And wherever the
flag comes and men behold it
they see in its sacred blazonry
no rampant lion and fierce eagle,
but only light, and every fold
significant of -liberty.
Let us then twine each thread
of the glorious tissue of our
country's flag about our heart
strings, and looking upon our
homes and catching the spirit
that breathes upon us from the
battlefields of our fathers, let us
resolve, come weal or woe, we
will in life and death stand by
the Stars and Stripes. Henry
Ward Beecher.
A. D. Davies, of Deming, New
Mexico, has invented a machine
for the purpose of cutting up
the soap weed, or what is com
monly called the Yucca plant,
so common to the great south
west. The machine . has been
installed and Mr. Davis says it
does the work intended. Patent
has been applied for. The pur
pose of the machine is to cut up,
this soap weed, converting it
into feed for cattle. This feed
has been tested in Arizona and
other places and has proved ex.
cellent. The weed contains ab
out 70 per cent of water, 6.4 per
cent protein and 18 per cent
fiber, making a well balanced
ration.

Cardui, the woman's

she writes: "I had a
general breaking-down
of my health. I was in
bed for weeks, unable to
get up. 1 had such a
weakness and dizziness,
. . . and the pains were
very severe. A friend
to lmcl had tried every
th lg else, why not
Cardui ? . . . I did, and
soon saw it was helping
me . . . After 12 bottles,
I am strong and well."
TAKE
PROFESSIONAL CARDS.
The Woman's Tonic
Do you feel weak, diz
zy, worn-out? Is your
lack of good health caused
from any of the com
plaints so common to
women? Then why not
give Cardui a trial? It
should surely do for you
what it has done for so
many thousands of other
women who suffered it
should help you back to
health.
Ask some lady friend
who has taken Cardui.
She will tell you how it
helped her. Try Cardui.
