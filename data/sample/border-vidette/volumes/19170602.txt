In the legislature at Austin,
Texas on the 18th, the senate
bill by Hudspeth, providing for
an increase in the state ranger
force to a maximum of 1()00 men
and carrying an appropriation of
$250, 000, was passed by a vote
of 71 to 38.
Grass is showing satisfactorily
and there is water on the cattle
ranges to iNew Mexico ana west
Texss, acording to the reports of
the inspectors of the Panhandle
and Southwestern Stockmen's
association to secretary W. L.
Amonett in El Paso.
It is illegal to bar brands on
cattle being transferred from one
person to the other. It is the
law that in such transactions
the cattle shall be vented 01
counter brand en. The practice
of barring brands i countenanc
ed in Texas and New Mexico,
but it is against the law in Ariz
oua, and yet, some of our inspect
ors permit it.
One of the new laws that goes
into effect the 7th of June is
called the Cigarette act. By this
it is unlawful for any person in
the State of Arizona to furnish,
or cause to oe sola, given ( or
furnished, any cigars, cigarettes,
or cigarette papers, smoking, or
chewing tobacco of any kind or
character to any person under
the age of 21 years.
This is decidedly no time for
the loafer. Every able bodied
man can find work now if he will.
Farmers want men to work.
Every man who is willing to do
a lair nay s worK ataecent wage,
we believe, can find a job. And
at this time it is but little short
of a crime for a strong, hearty
man to consume the world's
goods and not aid in production.
Northern Arizona deader.
Aliens, Mexicans, will be re
quired to register if they are be
tween the ages prescribed, but
will not be subject to draft, ac
cording to Adjutant General
Harris. Aliens will have to
register," said Col. Harris today
when the fact that some alarm
was oeing expressed ny toe
Mexicans was called to his at
tention, but they are in the
exempted list, and will not be
drafted for service."
Successful cabbage culture in
northen Arizona has been demon
strated and it also has been de
monstrated that northern Ariz
ona cabbage is unequalled for
its excellence, being very sound
and sweet. If the plants are put
out with care and at the right
time and then well cared for, a
crop is reasonably certain. The
plant is hardy and will grow a
month after frosts come in the
fall. Williams News.
The recent rains have covered
the valleys of the surrounding
country with weeds and grasses,
and although the stock of the
country has just passed through
one of the worst winters for feed
that has ever been experienced
here, it is now as fat and glossy
as anyone would care to look
upon. From the indications it
would appear that rain is to be
one of the regular orders of the
calendar from this time on, and
it is to be hoped that this is the
case. Mohave Miner.
It seems that some people are
led to believe that when they
enrolled their names with the
couny assessor jt then became
unnecessary for them to further
enroll their names as eligibles
for military duty. There is
nothing further from the fact.
The enrollment by the county
assessor was from the ages of
18 to 45 and was merely for the
purpose of showing the military
strength of the nation. The en
rollment to take place on June
5th is under the provisions of
the selective draft measure just
adopted by congress and is for
the purpose of selecting an army
from men between the ages of
21 and 31 years. Under the
selecti ve draft bill all men be
tween the ages of 21 and 31 are
obliged to register on June 5th,
be they citizen or foreigner.
From the number registered on
that date the war department
will select men for service.
The largest number of sheep
grazed on any single National
Forest is 315,740, finding past
urage on the Humboldt in Nev
ada, while the largest number of
cattle-75,818 head is found on
the Tonto in Arizona. The value
of the average annual meat pro
duct of these two National for
ests is estimated at $2,000,000.
Joe Rebeil brought out 200 one,
two and three year old steers
from Sonora this week. Mr. Re
beil had over 2,000 head to bring
over but they were not gathered
and he rushed out this small
bunch before the new order went
into effect by the Mexican gov
ernment placing an export duty
on cattle of !2u gold per head
The Alamo Cattle Co. also
brought out a bunch at the same
time. Arizona Cattleman.

WHAT A GOVERNMENT BOND IS
The Government of the Unit
ed States has two methods of
raising money. One is by tax
ation. The other is by the sale
of bonds, which is a method of
borrowing money.
The Government bond is the
printed promise of the Govern
ment to pay interest on it at re
gular intervals until it is repaid.
The Government borrows mo
ney in this way only after it has
been given the right to do so by
act of Congress approved by
the President, and the terms of
the loan are set out in the act.
Back of the promise of the
Government stands the honor of
the Government and all its tax
ing lesources. Really the whole
wealth of the Nation stands be
hind this solemn promise of the
Government to pay.
This makes a United States
Government bond the safest in
vestment in the world. If the
bond of the United States Gov
ernment is not safe, no property
in the United States is safe. If
the United States can not pay
its bonds, it is hardly probable
that it will be able to protect
the citizens in their other rights.
The Liberty Loan Bonds of
1917 are especially attractive in
vestments. Not only have they
this absolute safety character
istic of all United States bonds
but they are tax free not only
from all existing taxes but from
any war tax tnat may subse
quently he levied. No State,
city, nor county may tax them.
The inheritance tax of the Unit
ed States and of some States
may affect them, or rather, af
fect their transfer after death
of the owner by will or by in
heritance.
Another advantage these
Liberty Loan BoDds possess is
that if the Government issues
bonds later on during this war
at a higher rate of interest the
holders of Liberty Loan Bonds
will be allowed to exchange at
par their bonds for bonds bearing
the higher rate of interest.
It is not necessary to pay cash
in full for a bond. One can pay
down 2 per cent of the purchase
price on application that is. $1
for a $50 bond, $2 for a $100
bond etc. 18 per cent on July
25, 1917; 20 per cent July 30,
1917; 30 per cent August 15,
1917; and the balance, 30 per
cent, August 30, 1917.

5 Those who, through sick
ness shall be unable to register,

POSTMASTERS WILL BE EYES

Postmasters are in receipt of
a communication from C. Koons,
first assistand postmaster gen

of all suspicious characters, dis
loyal and treasonable acts and
anything which might be of im
portance during the existence of
the war. This information is to
be forwarded to the inspector in
charge of this district.
Owing to the many unusual
duties which of necessity will be
imposed on the postal service
Postmaster General Burleson
has issued an order limiting the
leave of absence of those con
nected with the department.
Owing to emergency it has been
found necessary to cancel all
leaves of absence except those
granted to employes with pay,
those who are on military duty
and those absent on account of
sickness.
Our government contemplates
enlisting industrial Mexico on
the side of the United States
and the allies. Already plans
are well matured for loaning
$50,000,000 to Mexico to be used
in the state of Chihuahua and
elsewhere in rich agricultural
sections, to help the farmers.
Mexico has a fertile soil and ex
cellent climate adopted to grow
ing food products. It will serve
the double purpose of affording
profitable employment for the
people and at the same time
enable them to grow a big sur
plus to help feed the world.

PROCLAMATION OF REGISTRA
TION DAY.
Executive Department, State of Arizona
Whereas, Congress, on the
eighteenth day of May, nineteen
seventeen, did pass the Selective
Draft provision of the War Army
Bill, otherwise known as the
Selective Service Law, requir
ing that all male persons be
tween the ages of twenty-one
and thirty, both inclusive, ex
cept certain persons in the mili
tary and naval service of the Un
ited States, present themselves
for registration between the
hours of seven a. m. and nine p.
m., on Tuesday, June fifth, nine
teen seventeen, at the precincts
wherein they have their per
manent homes, and providing a
penalty therefor; and
Whereas, The Provost Marsh
al General of the United States,
the officer in charge of the said
registration, has caused to be
sent to the Sheriff of each Coun
ty in Arizona, instructions for
the carrying out of the said re
gistration, and has invited the
aid of all civil authorities in the
prompt and accurate making of
the said registration, and has
urged that the widest publicity
be given this work:
Now, therefore, I, Thomas
E. Campbell, Governor of Ari
zona, by virtue of the author
ity vested in me under the said
law, do order that every male
resident of Arizona between the
ages aforesaid, whether an Am
erican citizen or alien, shall
present himself for registration
in his precinct, at the place de
signated therein, between the
hours of seven A. M. and nine
P. M. on Tuesday, June 5, 1917,
or suffer the penalty prescribed
by said law.
And it is earnestly recommend -ed
all possible facility be provid
ed by employers of such mala
persons as aforesaid, to the end
that a complete registration be
affored on that day and date.
The enrollment already per
formed by the Assessors of the
several Counties of Arizona un
der the military Code has no re
ference whatever to the subject
of this Proclamation', and such
previous enrollment does not in
any manner affect the obligation
of the aforesaid males as to the
Federal registration.
Since June fifth marks the
preliminary step in securing a
military census, from which is to
be raised and trained the best
army the world has known, a
necessity, because of an unjust
war forced upon the United
States, let the people of Ariz
ona make it a gala day in which
all, regardless of age or sex,
shall participate as a patriotic
duty.
In Witness Whereof, I have
hereunto set my hand and caused
the Great Seal of the State of
Arizona to be affixed.

Whkheas, at this time, the
World throbs "with the beat of

country, America, has entered
the World War, and on the side
of liberty and humanity that
were proclaimed by the Declara
tion of Independence July 4th,
1776, and in furtherance of ad
vancing those high irincioles of
humanity between man and man
and nation and nation;
And whereas, Tuesday, June
5th. 1917, has been declared a
legal holiday and fixed by the
proper authorities as the day
for the registration of the youth
and best young manhood, of our
land, from .the ages of 21 to 30

this nation:
NOW THEREFORE IT IS HERE

If Mr. Moeur is a candidate for
