markets reported yesterday. The
total to date for the season is
591 carloads, as against 514 car
loads to date last year.
Automohilists have learned
with satisfaction that the bridge
over the Gila river at Florence
has been completed and is now
open to the public. The river
at that point has been the haunt
of a new sort of "road agent" or
land pirate, who held up auto
mobilists whose cars stuck in
the wash.
Figures of the Tax Commis
sion indicate the total value of
Arizona mineral production sub
ject to taxation to have been
$182,874,517.13. This represents
the gross returns received by
the mining companies from their

silver, manganese, tungsten and
all other metals.

in the Salt River valley, Free

in a cotton plant from a 20 acre
ranch of his about half a mile
north of the Grand canal on
Central avenue. The plant is 5
feet tall and has 2C0 bolls upon,
it. He states that several of his
plants are equally good.
Daniel Granville Cumberland
of Ray, an employe of the Ray
Consolidated Co., has offered a
stronger guaiantee of his loyal
ly and service to the country
than any other man in the Unit
ed States. He has ten sons in
the military and naval service of
the country at this time. They
are following in his steps for he
served in the Spanish-American
war.
A number of bad boys, who
had been unruly, were brought
before Judge Lockwood who
held juvenile court at Douglas,
yesterday, were sentenced to a
good spanking by the Judge,
which was administered by the
fathers of the boys. Judge Lock
wood has made it a practice to
punish bad boys in this manner
aod it is having the desired re
sults. Congressman Hayden sent to
The Prospector a copy of the
army appropriation bill passed
by congress and approved on
July 9, 1918. This measure car

Free trips from every county
in the State will be offered by
the State Fair to the champion
teams in both the girls' canning
and the boys' cowtesting work.
At the State Fair these teams
will compete for the State cham
pionship and also for two 30.00
scholarships offered by the Agri

University. These scholarships
are to be used for a trip to the

Dean G. M. Butler of the Ari
zona College of Mines and En
gineering, has been appointed
director of the Arizona state
bureau of mines. He will con
tinue to serve as dean of the
college of mines and engineer
ing. Greater emphasis is to be
placed by the bureau on geolo
gical investigations. It is said
that the lack of knowledge of
the geology of the state has
greatly hampered the develop
ment of the mining resources of
Arizona. An expert geologist
will be employed.
Statements which have been I
in circulation in Salt River val- J
ley to the effect that the food j
administration had issued a rul
ing prohibiting the storing of
hay are erroneous. The nation
al food administration has speci
fically exempted hay from the
C0-day contract and storage rule
on food commodities.
During the last three weeks of
June, James E. Treagle, the re
presentative of Morris & Co., of
Chicago, is said to have paid out
over $400,000 in cash to the
stockmen of Yavapai county.
Clarence Denny and George Mil
ler of Fort Rock and Dave and
.James Wingtield of Camp Verde
were among those getting big
checks. Another 100,000 will
probably be sent here for cattle
by the same firm this year.
There will be about 1,000 acres
more oats in Arizona this year
than in 15)17, according to figurts
furnished by L. M. Harrison,
field agent for the United States
department of agriculture. The
estimate is 11,500 acres this
year, as compared to 10,495 last
year. Apache is the largest oat
county, with 3,500 acres estim
ated for this year. Coconino is
next, with 3,200 acres; Navajo
third, with 1,200 acres and Mari
copa fourth with 1,000 acres.

taken to have Lieut. Thomas
Maddock, former republican
state chairman now in the na

stated that steps have been
taken to secure Iv.eut. Maddock's
consent by cable and in the

are being circulated.
Col. Charles W. Harris, state
adjutant general, has received
notice from the provost marshal
general calling all of the negro
registrants of the 1917 registra
tion. The call is for 39, but
there are only 35 within the

Elmer Welch, who has a big
herd of goats in the Wallapai
mountains, has arranged for the
installation of a condensing plant
on the ranch, where 1500 goats
will be milked and the milk con
densed and canned for use. Goat
milk is said to be the richest
milk in use and should find a
wide sale, especially in this sec
tion of the country. The goats
have splendid pasturage and
the ranch is well watered. This
new industry should be fostered
by the business interests of the
county. Miner.
Reports that have come to the
Arizona Council of Defense show
that Arizona gave magnificent
response to the President's sug
gestion that residents of foreign
ancestry or birth join in the
celebration of the Fourth of July
as a new Independence Day for
the peoples of the world. The
Fourth was more generally cele
brated in Arizona than ever be
fore and in nearly every com
munity there was participation
of the foreign element of the
population, who marched in sec
tions of the parades, presented
emblematic lloats. mingled in the
main exercises of the day or
held patriotic meetings of their

United States Permits Commodities
to Enter Mexico.
A complete list of all commo
dities and articles that may go
into Mexico was received last
Monday by Special Agent W. T.
Haley of the War Trade Board.
The list follows:
1. Corn, 1,500,000 bushels,
approximately 80,000 tons, be
tween now and November. If
purchases are in considerable
quantities they should be made
through United States Food Ad
ministration.
2. Coke will be licensed if
drawn from certain specified dis
tricts.
3. Ammonia will be supplied
to Mexico for ice making, re
frigerating, and foodstuffs, but
not for beer making. In other
words, Mexico will be treated in
exactly the same way as all
other South and Central Amer
ican countries.
4. Agricultural machinery li
censes will be granted liberally.
Mining machinery licenses,
where required for production of
metals, will bo granted liberally.
5. Articles of iron and steel
manufacture. Generally speak
ing, this country will license
freely all articles of steel and
iron manufacture which are to
be used for the purpose of pro
ducing war material for this
country. In other cases this
country, on account of the ne
eessity for conservation, restricts
the exportation of iron and steel
to all countries.
6. Articles for the exploita
tion of mines, especially cyanide,
dynamite caps, and fuses. Mex
ico is now getting cyanide for
their gold products. All coun
tries have been rationed with
respect to cyanide, since there
is not enough to go around. Ex
port licenses are granted for
dynamite to Mexico as required
for mining purposes. The same
applies to caps and fuses.
7. Common soap. License will
be granted for 2,0(X) tons.
8. Licenses will be granted
for copper in manufactured form
to as great an extent as the con
servation measures of the United
States will permit. The same
applies to zinc. United States
is short of ferromanganese and,
accordingly, will not be able to
grant export licenses -for this
commodity to any great extent.
9. Licenses will freely be
granted for the following food
stuffs to Mexico: Canned her
ring, canned sardines, butter,
cocoa, condensed milk, corn,
corn meal, corn flour, confec
tionery (including chocolate can
dy), barreled beef, dried fruit,
lard, mutton oil, oats, pork,
pork products, oleo oil, peas (not
seed), tea. Purchases in con
siderable quantities to be made
through Food Administration.
The United States will freely
license all pork products to Mex
ico. The United States is also pre
pared to license for export to
Mexico a considerable amount of
railway equipment the character
of which has been cominumeat
ed to the Mexican Government.

BAKER A CANDIDATE.
Former Chief Justice Seeks Nomina
tion of Justice of Supreme Court.
The name of Judge A. C.
Baker will be submitted to the
democratic voters for nomina
tion to the office of Judge of the
Supreme Court, at the primary
election, September 10, 1918.
President Cleveland appointed
Judge Baker Chief Justice of
the Supreme Court in 1893. Dur
ing the time he held this high
office, he wrote many opinions
of prime importance in the judi
cial history of the state. These
opinions clearly express the rule
of law governing each particular
case, and are simply and brielly
stated without ostentation or
useless excursions into literary
fields, and are singularly free
from a'l appearances of political
I bias.
JUDGE A. C. BAKER
He was a member of the Con
stitutional Convention, and serv
ed with distinction in that body.
Among other important meas
ures introduced and advocated
by him was resolution No. 4,
providing for the initiative and
referendum, and although the
committee changed this resolu
tion somewhat in phraseology,
and in some particulars added
thereto, yet it served as a basis
for the resolution afterwards in
troduced by the committee pro
viding for the initiative and re
ferendum, as it now stands in
the Constitution.
Judge Baker has filled many
other places of public trust with
fidelity and ability. He was a
member of the 11th Legislative
Assembly. He served as Assist
ant U. S. District Attorney for
one term, and District Attorney
of Maricopa county for three
terms. He has been president
of the State Bar Association,
and at the present time is a
member of the State Board of
Law Examiners, which conducts
the examination of applicants
for admission to ths bar.
As a lawyer, his standing is
exceedingly high. His learning
in the law, coupled with a rigid
impartiality in the formation of
his opinions, his freedom from
any kind of prejudice, social or
political, his unflagging indus
try, and his frankness and fear
lessness in the discharge of a
public duty, eminently qualifies
him for the high position of
judge of the Supreme Court.
He has appeared as counsel,
for one side or the other, in a
large number of the most im
portant cases tried in the state
for nearly forty years. When
the liquor interests, backed by
an array of the best legal talent
in the state, attacked the pro
hibition amendment as unconsti
tutional and sought to enjoin its
enforcement, Judge Baker, as
sociated with the attorney gen
eral, appeared before the Fed
eral Court in California in de
fense of the law. The court
refused to enjoin the inforce
ment of the amendment, and it
remained intact and unimpaired
until the opinion of the Supreme
Court of the state was handed
down, permitting the introduc
tion of liquor into the state for
personal use.
Judge Baker is a firm demo
crat. However, he has never
suffered his political views to
affect him in the discharge of a
public duty. The Judge has
been greatly interested in work
for the Red Cross and urging
the purchase of Liberty Bonds.
His addresses in behalf of these
causes have been issued with a
spirit of fervid patriotism, and
have been extremely helpful.
His two sons, Alexander and
Robert, are in the United States
Army, serving their country, of
which fact he is justly proud.
Leslie Wood and Al. Saxon
are now members of the Nogales
police force under Chief Jay
Lowe.

Grammer School Destroyed by Fire.
Last Wednesday evening about
7 o'clock the Nogales grammer
school was destroyed by fire,
the origin of which is unknown.
Soon after the fire was dis
covered, the Fire Department,
assisted by soldiers of the 35th
Infantry, were on the scene do
ing everything possible to save
the beautiful structure, a por
tion of which was destroyed by
j fire on May 12, last. The fiames
had already gotten beyond con
' trol of the fire fighters, who did
splendid work in confining the
fire to the doomed building.
Several young boys who were
playing in the school grounds
were detained by the police, but
they had no trouble proving
they knew nothing of the cause
of the fire, which is thought by
some, to be the work of an in
cendiary. The original insurance on the
building was $1,000, $7,000 of
which was paid after the May
fire, leaving a balance of $i,000.
It is estimated that the cost of
rebuilding the grammer school
will be between 830, (XX) and $40,
000. E. J. Lovell had the contract
for repairing the damage done
by the fire last May, his bid be
ing $13,800, one thousand of
which had been paid by the
trustees, who are arranging to
erect a temporary building for
use pending the rebuilding of
the grammer school, which will
be doue as soon as possible.
