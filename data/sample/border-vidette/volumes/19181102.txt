The Spirit of Friendship.
This store looks upon its patrons not
merely as customers but as friends.
People purchase here because they
have friendly feeling for this store.
The cause which develops this friendly
feeling, may differ, in fact, they are
sure to differ. One's friendship for
the store is the result of finding good
values; another's is the result of effi
cient service and courteous treatment,
and so on.
Naturally this friendshiply feeling on
the part of our patrons is reciprocated
on our part. And this spirit of mutual
friendship is an impetus for greater
service and an incentive to ever-increasing
endeavor to make this store
a place where every visitor will feel
perfectly at home.

MAJOR CARL HAYDEN.
Popular Arizona Congressman Com
missioned An Officer.
Honorable Carl Hayden, mem
ber of congress, has been hon
ored with a commission of Major
in the United States Army. Con
gressman Hayden applied to the
President a little over a year
ago for this commission and was
successful in securing it only a
short time ago.
COPIES OF TELEGRAMS
Washington, D. C,
October 8, 1918.
Hon. Geo. Babbitt,
Chairman, Democratic State
Central Committee,
Phoenix, Arizona.
I regret intensely the unfair
and false accusations that are
being made in the press and
elsewhere' against the patriotic
record of Hon. Carl Hayden.
This wilful misrepresentation of
his record votes in congress is
infainous. His specific answer
to every charge made by the.-Na-tional
Security League, of New
York, will, I trust, be circulated
among the people of Arizona,
and visit on this campaign of
misrepresentation the rebuke
that its gross slanders so richly
deserve.
Hayden has supported the
president in this war with fideli
ty and force. This is no time to
elect a republican from Arizona
wheu democratic supremacy in
the House of Representati ves is
seriously challenged, especially
when a faithful and true repre
sentative must be sacrificed on
the altar of falsehood and deceit.
Mark A. Smith.
Washington, D. C,
October 8, 1918.
Hon. Geo. Babbi tt,
Chairman, Democratic State
Central Committee,
Phoenix, Arizona.
I have known Carl Hayden in
timately during his six years'
service in congress; have served
on same committees with him;
have lived in same hotels with
him. He has honored Arizona
as Arizona has honored him.
During this entire service, Hay
den has been true to his presi
dent, true to his State, true to
his country, true to his Hag, true
to the boys at the front. He has
stood every test; he has upheld
the hands of the President every
day. President Wilson not only
desires but deserves the re elec
tion of Hayden who will stand
by him, who will sustain him
during the critical period after
the close of the world's greatest
war.
Scott Ferris,
Chairman, Democratic Con
gressional Committee.
Washington, D. C,
October 8, 1918.
Hon. Geo. Babbitt,
Chairman, Democratic State
Central Committee,
Phoenix, Arizona.
Considering the immense bur
dens and enormous responsibili
ties resting upon the shoulders
of President Wilson, a patriotic
citizenshi p should be willing that
the president should have mem
bers of congress in harmony and
sympathy with his views. lie
presentative Carl Hayden has
been a constant, vigilant, intelli
gent and remarkably effective
supporter of President Wilson's
policies. Hayden has never
flinched or failed in any duty.
The next House of Represent
atives may have to do with the
! great task of reconstruction and
Hayden's experience is of im
mense value, not only to Ari
zona, but to the entire nation as
well.
Experience is all important
here in Washington. Hayden
has membership on three of the
most important committees of
the House. These valuable com
mittee assignments have placed
him in a stragetic position where
he is able to and does render ex
tremely valuable service to our
great Southwest. Hayden has
superb moral courage, is an able,
resourceful, industrious man and
no State has a more valuable re
presentative.
Henry P. AshursT.
STEADY, NOW !
Imagine a great battle raging
along the American front in
Prance a battle in which our
boys are firing 5,000 of the 1918
model of the wonderful Brown
ing machine rifle. Imagine that
battle lasting one hour, and
these guns shooting steadily
throughout the hour at their
maximum rate. Is your imagin
ation working well"' Then, im
agine how many bullets these
riiles would have fired at end of
the hour.
Steady, now !
At the end of one hour's con
tinuous firing, they w.ould have
peppered the Huns with 112,
500,000 rounds of ammunition.
These figures are authentic,,
having been furnished by the
Ordinance Department of the
United States Army.
It is difficult to conceive a
weapon being so constructed as
to permit of sending out such an
enormous number of missels of
death in so short a time, but the
peorJTeof Arizoua will have an
oppOTTQnity during the State
Fair, December 2 to 9, to see
just how these rilles are con
structed, for several of them
will be included in the govern
ment display which will be at
the Fair grounds all week.
There will also be a Lewis
aircraft machine gun, a moun
tain gun of 2.95 calibre, U. S.
A. rifles of different models; in
fact a general display of the
weapons carried at this moment
by our boys in France.
Reasons Given for Amendment IOO.
"After carefully reading Am
endment 100, I am convinced
that it is a great improvement
over the present law, which is
almost useless, either to em
ploye or employer. I shall do
all I can for 100." J. Nelson
Nevius. Octave, Ariz.
"If I understand the present
laws there is nothing in them
providing amounts that should
be paid. For instance, a man
loses one arm. What should the
employer pay for such loss $100
or SI, 000? The present laws do
not say. The controveisy must
be laid befort an expensive jury
to decide. If injuries were rat
ed, as under Amendment 100,
there would be no use for a law
yer, court or juror. It would
stop lawsuits and reduce strife
between employers and employes
and will most surely have my
support." C. A. Johnson, Lo
well, Ariz.
"I know the present laws al
low great abuses and I shall do
a ll in my power for the proposed
Amendment 100." Grant Mc
Laughlin, Douglas, Ariz.
"Assuredly I am heartily for
Amendment 100. It will be a
great help to Arizona." M. S.
Peysert, Douglas, Ariz.
"I am heaitily in favorof Am
endment 100 and shall work and
vote for it." James H. East,
Douglas, Ariz.
"I feel it to be my duty and
shall do all in my power to en
act Amendment 100, as I am
convinced it is for the benefit of
all." Frank J. Wasser, Bisbee,
Ariz.
Turn the proposition around.
If the allies were all but down
and out, would Germany permit
cessation of fighting while they
haggled over terms ?
GEO. W. P. HUNT DENIES HE WILL i
BE GOVERNOR NEXT YEAR.
Phoenix, Ariz., Oct. 20. De
nying that through any circum
stances he will be governor of
Arizona after January 1, 1919,
and insisting that the democratic
nominee, Fred. T. Colter, is eli
gible for that office, Governor
Hunt, yesterday through Geo.
Babbitt, chairman of the Demo
cratic state committee, sent the
following letter to "the voters
of Arizona."
Executive Office, State House,
Phoenix, Ariz., Oct. 25, 19is.
To the Voters of Arizona:
Presumably because of the
lack of any real issues and pos
sibly because they are afraid to
make a campaign upon the rec
ord of their candidate, I observe
that the Republican party is
seeking votes for their candidate
through the means of a far
fetched snbterfuge which would
have the voters believe that a
vote for the Democratic nomi
nee, Fred T. Colter, is a vote to
retain me in office. It is with
great reluctance that I dignify a
campaign story of this sort with
a denial, but this friction having
reached its culmination in to
day's issue of the Phoenix morn
ing paper, in justice to Mr. Col
ter, to the Democratic party,
and to myself, but chiefly that
the entire citizenry of Arizona
may know exactly where I
stand, I wish to state positively
that I have no intention or de
sire to hold office for one minute
after the close of the year 1918.
If I had any desire at all for
public office again. I would have
been a candidate before the peo
pie of the state, and if I should
ever decide to enter public life
again I shall make a straight
forward announcement to that
effect, as I have always done in
the past.
When I-was reseated as gov
ernor of Arizona, on December
22, 1917, 1 announced that I
would not be a candidate for
governor at the next election.
The subsidized press insisted
that I was not sincere in that
statement, and so insisted up to
the very eve of the primary.
These same newspapers are now
insisting that I will continue to
hold office if Mr. Colter is elect
ed. There is absolutely no
doubt in my mind or in the mind
of any unprejudiced observer,
that Mr. Colter is eligible, but
irrespective of that fact, and ir
respective of who may receive
the greatest number of votes at
the election, whether it be Mr.
Goiter or Mr. Campbell, the
electorate of Arizona has my
assurance, which means my
word, that on January 0, 191'.),
the office of governor will be
turned over to the candidate who
receives the certificate of elec
tion from the secretary of state.
Very respectfully yours,
Geo. W. P. Hi nt.
Governor of Arizona.
Lieutenant O'Neill of Nogales Cited
for Bravery in Action.
Second Lieut. Ralph A. O'
Neill, aviation service, 147th
aero squadron, lias been cited
for extraordinary bravery in ac
tion near Chateau Thierry.
France, on July 2. Lieutenant
O'Neill is the son of Mr. and
Mrs. R. L. O'Neill, of Nogales.
Lieutenant O'Neill and four
other pilots attacked 12 enemy
battle planes. In a violent bat
tle within the enemy's lines they
brought down three German
planes, one of which was credit
ed to Lieutenant O'Neill for the
following act of extraordinary
heroism in action: On July 5,
1918, Lieutenant O'Neill led
three other pilots in battle
against eight German pursuit
planes near Chateau Thierry,
France. Lieutenant O'Neill at
tacked the leader, opening fire
at about 150 yards and closing
up to 30 yards range. After a
quick and decisive light the en
emy aircraft fell in flames.
Lieutenant O'Neill then turned
on three other machines that
were attacking him from the
rear and brought one of them
down. The other five enemy
planes were driven away."

J. N. Wilkey . Justice of the Peace

As Justice of the Peace, N. J.
Wilkey has made Rood, and his
election next Tuesday is assured.
From every county in the
state comes the news that Fred
Colter, Democratic candidate for
governor, is going to win next
Tuesday.
Elect to Congress and to the
office of Governor men who will
fight the Kaiser, not Wilson.
Supporters not critics will win
the war. Help Wilson win the
war.
Raymond Earhart has made
good as sheriff of Santa Cruz
county, and deserves to be re
elected another term. He is
honest and capable, and there is
no reason why he should not re
ceive a big majority. Vote for
Raymond.
Hon. W. A. O'Connor, Santa
Cruz county Democracy's choice
for Judge of the Superior Court,
is one of Arizona's brightest at
torneys at law. As present in
cumbent he has made an en.via
ble record as a fair and impar
tial Judge. His friends predict
his election by a handsome ma
jority.
T. P. Thompson, Democratic
nominee for State Senator, is
said to be running like a "house
afire," in every precinct in the
eounty. Mr. Thompson has re
sided in the county many years
and has a host of friends Re
publicans and Democrats who
will see to it next Tuesday, that
he goes "over the top" by a
handsome majority.
The election next Tuesday of
Robt. E. Leu, to the office of
clerk of the Superior Court, is
conceded by Republicans and
Democrats. Mr. Lee is one of
the most efficient court report
ers in Arizona. He has had
many years of practical exper
ience, and thoroughly under
stands the duties of clerk. He
will be elected by a big majority.
"Mother" Saxon, popular and
efficient Superintendent of
Schools, has given such thorough
satisfaction that she will be re
elected next Tuesday by an over
whelming majority. There is no
reason why Mrs. Saxon should
not receive every Democratic
vote cast next Tuesday, and
there is every reason why she
should receive the support of
every Democrat.
Arcus Reddoch, efficient, ac
commodating county recorder, is
going to be re-elected next Tues
day by the biggest majority he
ever received. There are more
than four hundred Democrats
than Republicans in Santa Cruz
county, and Arcus is going to
get 'em all. Scores of Repub
licans who have had business in
the recorder's office, say they
are going to cast their ballot for
Arcus. He's got a cinch.
Friends of Hon. Leslie C.
Hardy, acting county attorney,
who is now at the officers' train
ing school in Texas, say he is
going to carry every precinct in
the county, for the office of
county attorney, for which he is
a candidate on the Democratic
ticket. Leslie Hardy is one of
the best attorneys at law in the
state. He is an honorable, high
class gentleman. His election
13' a big majority is assured.
A von: for Oscar E Ashburn
of Patagonia, and for Jas. L.
Finley of Canilie, Democratic
candidates for supervisor, is a
vote for two of Santa Cruz coun-
t.v's best known, successful men,
i who with J. A. Harrison, the
hold-over member, will carefully
Kuard the taxpayers' money.
Messrs. Ashburn and Finley are
pledged for "Good roads." They
should receive a majority in
I every precinct in the county.
Tin: following telegram has
been received by The Border
Vidette from Tom Drennan,
Secretary of the State Democra
tic Central Committee, and T. D.
Shaughnessy, secretary of the
Maricopa County Democratic
Central Committee: "Maricopa
county looking fine for Hayden,
Colter and the entire Democratic
ticket. The attack on President
Wilson is changing hundreds of
votes. Campbell is losing ground
rapidly. Coiter will carry Ma
ricopa county."
Howard Keener, editor of
the S:inta Cruz Patagonian and
owner of a fine farm in the San
liafael valley, is thoroughly
competent to conduct the office
ot county treasurer, to which he
is going to be elected next Tues
day. Mr. Keener will give the
business of the important office
his personal attention, which is
a guarantee that the business of
the treasurer'a office will be con
ducted in a careful, painstaking
manner. He is a high class, pa
triotic citizen, and a Democrat.
Vote for him.
Wirt G. Bowman, nominee on
the Democratic ticket, for State
Representative, is one of Santa
Ci;iz county's most representa
tive citizens. He is a heavy tax
payer and as a member of the
Legislature, will carefully guard
the taxpayers' interests. He has
been wonderfully successful in
the conduct of his personal af
fairs, and the people can make
no mistake by sending him to
Phoenix to represent them. He
is a life-long Democrat and a
loyal, patriotic American, being
president of the One Hundred
Percent American Club of No
gales. As mayor of Nogales he
is making a splendid record. As
State Representative he'll make
good.
CAMOUFLAGE PUNCTURES.
Opinion of Judge Oaniel E. Parks,
Republican Candidate for Superior
Judge of Yavapai County, Relative
to the Eligible of Hon. Fred. T.
Colter.
Editor Courier: Answering
your question on the subject, 1
have to say that there is noth
ing in the suggested disqualifi
cation of Senator Colter as a
candidate for the office of gov
ernor, to which he has been no
minated by his party:
Sub section 5 of section 2 of
article IV of the Arizona Con
stitution, upon which the said
supposition is founded, reads as
follows, viz: "No member of
the legislature during the term
for which he shall have been
elected, shall be appointed or
elected to any civil office of pro
fit under this state which shall
have been created, or the emolu
ments of which shall have been
increased, during said term."
Section 12 of article 2 of the
Wisconsin constitution relating
to the same subject is as follows,
viz: "'No member of the legis
lature shall, during the term for
which he was elected, be ap
pointed or elected to any civil
office in the state which shall
have been created, or the emolu
ments whereof shall have been
increased during the term for
which he was elected," and in
the case of State vs. Boyd 21,
Wisconsin Law Reports, the sn
preme court of Wisconsin held
that the said constitutional pro
vision did not disqualify a mem
bor of the legislature from hold
ing an office, the emoluments cf
which are increased during the
legislative term, but AFTER his
ELECTION TO SUCH OFFICE. At
! the time of that decision the
supreme court of Wisconsin was
presided over by Chief Justice
Luther S. Dixon, one of the
ablest jurists the country has
produced, not inferior to Chief
Justice Marshal or Shaw, and
his associate members were of
like character. True, Chapter
61 (Senate Bill No. 77) of the
laws of Arizona, 1917, increased
the salary of the governor to
$6,000, and the said law was
sought to be made effective (from
and after its passage) by means
of an emergency clause, but
such attempt was abortive un
der sub section 17 of said section
2 of article IV, above cited,
which provides as follows: "Nor
shall the compensation of any
publia officer be increased or
diminished during his term of
i office," so that the said law did
not and wu.i. not become effec
tive during the term of the gov
ernor then and now in office,
nor during Senator Colter's of
ficial term, resulting in Senator
Colter's exemption from said dis
qualifying clause of our consti
tution, the same not taking effect
until after his term of office
expires.
The supreme court of Wiscon
sin has also (in the case of Mil
waukee county vs. Hackett, 21
Wisconsin Reports 613) decided
in an able opinion of that court,
delivered by Chief Justice Dix
on, construing a provision of the
Wisconsin constitution similar
to said sub section 17 of ours,
that the word "compensation"
I as used in the constitution, ap
plies to those officers who re
ceived a fixed salary prom the
state. These constitutional pro
visions have been adopted gen
erally by the several states of
the Union, and it is reasonable
to conclude that the adoption of
the decisions of the other states
construing the same.
Dan'l E Parks.
Prescott. Ariz., Sept. 20, 101P.
(The above decision, holding
that the Legislator elected to an
office, the emoluments of which
had been increased during his
legislative term, could, under
certain conditions, hold that of
fice, EVEN DURING HIS EEOISEA
tive term, is a much stronger
case than is necessary to sustain
the eligibility of Fred. T. Colter
for Governor.)

Customs Chas. E. Hardy, has

Do you feel weak, diz

NEW YORK PAPER RETRACTS
EDITORIAL AGAINST MAJ.
CARL HAYDEN.
(Phoenix Republican.)
Some time ago there appear
ed in The Republican a political
advertisement containing a re
production of an editorial from
the New York Sun reflecting
upon Representative Carl Hay
den, who had just been appoint
ed a Major of Infantry. Since
then the Sun admitted that it
had been misinformed as to the
facts on which the editorial was
based and has printed a retrac
tion. The Republican feels that
as it became a part of the ma
chinery for the circulation of
the editorial, hereby in fairness
it prints the correction.
Under the head of "Correction
as to Major Hayden," the Sun
on October 10 said:
"We regret that the in forma
tion information from Arizona
upon which we based our recent
comment on the commissioning
of Representative Carl Hayden
of Arizona as a major in the
army now appears to have been
incorrect and incomplete, al
though furnished us from sources
that should have been fully
trustworthy: This we unwitt
ingly misrepresented and criti
cised Major Hayden, wherefore
we desire to make amends and
correct the error, as the Even
ing Sun strives above all to be
accurate and fair, particularly
to those with whose political
views we are not in agreement.
"We are told that Major Hay
den's commission was an eleven
th hour appointment, the impli
cation being that it was for
political effect. Instead, his ap
plication for an army appoint
ment, was made over a year ago
and was approved by the presi
dent on August 14, 1917. More
over, Major Hayden has served
ten years in the First Arizona
infantry (National Guard), from
1903 to 1913, enlisting as a pri
vate and rising to the rank of
major. He is also an expert
rifleman, having been a member
of the Arizona rifle team for
four years.
'Furthermore, his appoint
ment is not an 'arm chair' place
or a staff position, but witli the
infantry. He is now at a train
ing camp, and hopes to reach
France before the fighting is
over. Under the circumstances
his personal patriotism seems
beyond question and we are
pleased to make this full cor
rection of our unintentional
mistake."
ALBERT C. BAKER.
The name of Albert C. Baker,
Democratic nominee for Judge of
the Supreme Court, will be print
ed on the non partisan portion
of the ballot (above the party
tickets) and to vote for him you
must make a cross in the square
after his name in every instance.
A straight ticket, either Demo
cratic or Republican, will not
count for him make a cross in
the square after his name.
Judge Baker has practiced law
in Arizona for approximately
forty years, and is regarded as
one of the ablest lawyers in the
state. He is an Alabamian by
birth and has two sons in the
United States Army.
In 1893 President Cleveland
appointed Judge Baker Chief
Justice of the Supreme Court of
the Territory of Arizona. He
was a delegate to the Constitu
tional Convention; served three
terms as District Attorney of
Maricopa county, one term as
Assistant United States District
Attorney, and was a member of
the 11th Legislative Assembly.
He has been president of the
State Bar Association, and at
present is a member of the State
Board of Law Examiners.
He is a Democrat. Vote for
him.
STAND BY THE PRESIDENT.
In the last four years the peo
ple of this country have learned
to give. First, we learned to
give outright for the wronged
and ruined people of Belgium,
then came many other calls as
the devastation of war spread
east and wet. We laarned to
give all we could spare, and to
do without what had seemed ne
cessities, and have done this un
conplainingly. We have given
and lent and saved and co oper
atel. Parents having given life
to their sons, learned to give
them up the hardest lesson of
all. All this we have done for
our country, and it is not too
much. When liberty is at stake
all we have is not too much.
During all these days and
nights of horror and world ago
ny, we have thought a good deal
more of the Ship of State than
we have of the Captain who
must steer that ship through all
the perils that besest its course.
That is as it should be and as he
would have it, but now, when
those perils are at least as great
as they have ever been, with
fresh complications arising every
day, we should stop and think
of that wearied and burdened
man who bears the brunt of the
battle for us
At the coming election there
is one last, least thing for us to
give we should give the Pre
sident of the United States a
vote of confidence. We should
demonstrate to the wot Id that
there is no group of malcontents
seeking to change the course of
this government. In a tug of
war nobody takes his hands off
the rope there is no time to
change hands. We should elect
Senators and Congressmen who
will sustain the President. Wo
haven't had a chance to do any
thing for him before. The least
we can do now is to give him a
ballot vote for those who are
in hearty accord with him and
who will help him in the trying
times that are yet ahead of us.
