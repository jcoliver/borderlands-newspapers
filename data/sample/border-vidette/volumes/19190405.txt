THE NOGALES CHAUTAUQUA.
Ellison-White System Will Be 'Here
May 4-IO.
The first announcement of the
attractions to be presented at
the coming Chautauqua clearly
indicates that reconstruction pro
blems are receiving primary con
sideration in this important for
um of the people this year. Pro
bably never before have so many
men and women of national
standing been included on the
lecture list. After-the-war is
sues and developments are to be
treated from all angels and view
points.
Foremost among the members
of the staff stand Hon. J. Adam
Bede, formerly Congressman
from Minnesota, and Edward F.
Trefz, member of the American
Food Mission to Europe and
assistant to Herbert Hoover of
the Food Administration during
the war. Adam Bede is the
man who turned down the vice
presidency and set the nation
laughing by his keenly humor
ous article about it in a national
weekly. His lecture, "Our Na
tion; Its Problems and Pro
gress," will be one of the big
constructive messages of the
week. Edward F. Trefz, is
known throughout the country
not only for his war worK, but
also as one of the organizers of
the National Chamber of Com
merce at Washington and for
years the Field Secretary. In
the past eight years he has de
livered 4891 addresses before
Chamber of Commerce and Na
tional Trade Association meet
ings. He is a business orator
and will treat the Reconstruc
tion problems from a business
man's viewpoint.
Private Peat, unquestionably
one of the greatest lecturers,
humorists and writers the war
period has produced, will tell
the war story of the week. His
book, "Private Peat," his arti
cles in the national magazines
and his movie films have made
his name, a household word
throughout the United States
and Canada.
The music of the week is of
more than usual interest. The
feature attraction is to be Jaro
slav Clmera and his Czecho
Clovak Band, a splendid musical
organization from that little
country of Bohemia which has
been so much in the eyes of the
world of late. In the evening
Madame Helen Gafarelli, former
ly in Chicago opera, will pre
sent a group of Bohemian folk
songs. Another headline musi
cal attraction will be the Chau
tauqua tour of Mary Adel Hays,
the New York coloratura so
prano who has established a
prominent place for herself in
the world of music. - She will
appear on the fourth evening,
assisted by her company of Re
cital Artists. The Lewis Mili
tary Quartet, forty voices picked
from forty thousand at Camp
Lewis, is probably the best male
voice ensemble that has ever
been over the Chautauqua cir
cuits. Each member is a con
cert or opera singer, with the
ability to do splendid solo work.
Other musical companies to be
presented during the week are
the Fillion Concert Party, under
the direction of Ferdinand Fil
lion and including Fern Goltra,
formerly with the Chicago Grand
Opera Association; the McDon-ough-Eagleston
Company, two
musical fun makers, the Reg
niers, in music and entertain
ment, and the Apollo Concert
Company, live exceptional musi
cians featuring the Apollophone
in their two concerts.
Edwin M. Whitney, of Boston,
is another big name in the pro
gram list. This famous inter
preter of plays brings "Turn to
the Right" in monologue form.
He has the exclusive rights on
this big metropolitan success
and his delineation of its dozen
characters borders on the pre
noLuenal. Another entertainur
well known in the Chautauque
voild on the coming program is
Elsie Mae Gordon. This talent
ed Hoosier girl will present the
negro, Italian and child sketches,
which have won name and fame
for her.
The children's work is given
special stress this year. A uni
que pageant, "'Uncle Sam's Ex
periment," is to be presented by
the kiddies on the last after
noon. A travelling pagent di
rector will have charge of the
work and a Story Lady specially
trained in playground work will
come for the full week as usual.
PROHIBITION, SHARP PRACTICE
The suit led in the United
States District Court carries with
it the assurance that the consti
tution of the Prohibition clause
of the Agricultural Appropria
tion Act of November 21, 1918,
will be thoroughly tested. It is
time that the people of this
country find out where they
stand in the matter. Among
millions of law abiding persons
the strong conviction prevails
that only by sharp practice and
dopble'dealing was the present
situation created. If they have
any rights left, it is a lact worth
knowing. If they have a just
grievance, it should be promptly
redressed. j
The Prohibition provision was
put through Congress under
false pretenses as a war emer
gency measure. At the time the
war was literally over and the
armistice signed. The American
people had never taken Prohibi
tion seriously. They had never
looked on it as possible, .for
their wishes had never been con
sulted. It was put through on
the sly, by the trick of tacking
a rider on an appropriation bill.
There never was any doubt of
the readiness of the people to
assent to any sacrifices required
of them in order to win the war.
They were prepared to deny
themselves food or drink or any
necessaries when the occasion
demanded. The Prohibitionists
reasoned that they could take
advantage of this spirit to carry
their scheme, and even after the
armistice was signed and the
emergency was over beyond all
chance of returning, they per
sisted in their game of deception.
The war Prohibition clause
was conceived in bad faith and
dishonesty. It was written into
the statutes through a kind of
fraud not to be forgiven; it was
foisted upon the country through
plain hypocrisy masking as loy
alty in time of war. When ex
posed, the authors of the scheme
boasted of their cunning in over
reaching the public. Whether
or not the courts hold the Pro
hibition provision to be valid, it
will remain one of the most dis
creditable chapters in the his
tory of American legislation.

Greenway Gets Service Cross.
The citation of Lieutenant Col
onel John C. Greenway of Bis
bee for extraordinary heroism in
action has appeared in the war
department's official report sent
to the press. He has been award
ed the distinguished service cross
in the name of the president.
The acts for which Colonel
Greenway was cited were per
formed near Verdun, France on
October 23, 1919.
During a terrific enemy shell
ing on two of his battalions, and
after both his battalion com
manders had been wounded, Col.
Greenway personally directed
the activities and greatly en
couraged his forces by his pre
sence. Leading them in attack
he demonstrated the utmost valor
at the most critical moments,
and he was the first of his com
mand to enter the German trench
which marked the objective of
the day's attack.
PHOENIX HAS OLD TIME.
Maricopa county, outside of
the city of Phoenix, which has
not yet taken action, will not set
its clocks ahead in line with the
daylight saving schedule, which
due to go into effect throughout
the country next Sunday morn
ing. This was decided at a
meeting of the county supervis
ors late today
Numerous protests against ad
vancing the time one hour were
received from business men,
parents of school children and
farmers. Business men of Phoe
nix also are said to be opposed
to the daylight saving idea and
it is expected that the city will
follow the course taken by the
county. Gazette.
THE PATAGONIA DISTRICT.
Interesting Minitjg News From Last
Week's Santa Cruz Patagonian.
The Mowry mine, made fam
ous by Lieutenant Mowry dur
ing the Civil War; the property
that kept a mill and smelter
operating for a long time; the
property that has long com
manded the attention of mining
men this remarkable property
has again "come into its own."
Grant Lewis, who is foreman
of the Mowry brought the news
to town last evening that they
had just shot into an eight foot
face of the "old time shipping
dirt." As this strike has been
made from the 250 foot level and
in virgin ground it means the
Mowry will soon be on the ship
ping list in a substantial way.
The past performances on this
property prove that when ore is
once encountered that large con
tinuous ore shoots can be ex
pected. Congratulations to the
Mowry, to Mr. Mitchell, the
manager, and to the camp.
Word comes that the Hosey
property has been taken over by
a northern mining company and
that work will start on this
property some time in April.
This is the second northern min
ing company that has taken over
properties in this district during
the last thirty days. The first
parties, Messrs. Gross and Ken
nedy, have made arrangements
for the construction of a wagon
road to the American Boy and
Deep Down properties and have
also purchased machines for
operating these two properties.
Located in the high mountains
south of Patagonia, three miles
from town, is the Andes mine, a
property which is being devel
oped in a quiet and workman
like manner, and which gives
promise of becoming in time a
great copper producer. A shaft
was sunk on this property to a
depth of 90 feet, when a tunnel
was started which will eventual
ly strike the ore body at a depth
of 400 feet, after being driven a
distance of 1000 feet. Five hun
dred feet of this tunnel is al
ready completed and the work
of drifting is being continued
without intermission.
The Andes in the past has
shipped considerable high-grade
copper ore and at present there
are more than 2000 tons of low
grade ore on the dump. A splen
did road has been built to the
Andes and it can now be reach
ed by auto without difficulty.
One of the attractive features
of the property in question is a
pretty lake of a 25 foot dam.
The Andes is owned -by Col.
R. R. Richardson, while the
work is being done under the
direction of Ed. F. Bohlinger,
the well known mining man.
New developments on the
Hardshell mine, "owned by Col.
R. R. Richardson, are being car
ried forward as rapidly as pos
sible. Most of the machinery
moved from the old workings is
in place and work will proceed
with the new shaft, which will
be sunk to a depth of 500 feet.
The shaft will cut a big ledge of
ore when it is finished and at
the bottom is confidently expect
ed to strike the sulphides. The
shaft will also cut the old Alto
and Trench ledges. The Alto in
times gone by was a producer of
much rich ore and it is confi
dently expected the new work on
the Hardshell will uncover this
same vein.
The California property, ad
joining the Flux mine is being
steadily developed, miners at
present being engaged in driv
ing a 250 foot cross cut which
will strike the ore body at a
greater depth. The California
is a silver lead property located
about five miles from Patagonia
and is owned by E. E. Bethel
and W. S. Wilson.
The New York men who re
cently took a bond and lease on
the Blue Lead property, located
close to the Ivanhoe, about six
miles from Patagonia, ha ve wired
that the necessary money has
been secured to proceed with the
work called for in the bond and
lease, and the men ara daily ex
pected from the East to-begin
operations. It is the intention
of these parties to sink a shaft
to a depth of 100 feet and then
run a 200-foot drift and develop
a real mine before attempting to
ship any ore.
The Blue Lead is a silver lead
proposition and was recently
bonded by the Washington Trad
ing Company.
League Covenant Has Teeths
In a copyrighted editorial in
the Philadelphia Public Ledger,
former President Taft shows
that the covenant of the league
ofnations is strong and enforce
able, and in nowise contravenes
the policies or interests of the
United States.
Regarding the misconception
to which critics of the covenant
have given currency, Mr. Taft
said :
"The attitude of those who
favor the covenant has been mis
construed, increasing the con
fusion in the mind of the public
in respect to the inestimable
value of the covenant as it is.
Were the alternatives presented
exactly as it is, or of postpon
ing the coming of peace and
continuing the state of war until
the conference could reconvene
and make other provisions for
peace, I should without the
slightest fear as to the complete
safety of my country under its
provisions vote for it as the
greatest step in the betterment
of international relations for the
benefit of the people of the
world and for the benefit of my
country in recorded history."
Answering the contention that
the covenant is without provi
sion for enforcement, Mr. Taft
continued:
"The proposed league has real
teeth and a bite to it. It fur
nishes real machinery to organ
ize the power of the peaceful
nations of the world into econo
mic and military action, which
by its very existence and cer
tainty will keep nations from
war and will force them to the
acceptance of a peaceable settle
ment. This will dispense with
the necessity for the exercise of
economic pressure or foice."
That the $100,000,000 federal
soldiers' settlement plan which
failed of passage in the last ses
sion of congress, will come up
at a special session was the
word received from Secretary of
the Interior Lane by Alfred C.
Seleboth, secretary of the Sol
dier Settlement committee of
Arizona. The secretary of the
interior's letter stated that 32
states had acted on the scheme,
all of them having indorsed it
and many having named com
mittees to co operate with the
federal authorities to place re
turned fighters on farms. Ari
zona was among these states
which approved the proposal.

WE THANK YOU.
Nogales, on the international
line, sixty-seven miles south of
Tucson, is now the third city on
the border. The population is
generally estimated at nine
thousand on the American side
and six thousand on the Mexican
side. The city has doubled in
population in the past live years.
It has a progressive city admin
istration, splendid -public utili
ties, good stores and hotels, a
good club, and. is in every re
spect a modern little city. It
does most of the banking busi
ness for Sonora and has been
the supply point of that country
for some time. Millions of dol
lars worth of agricultural pro
ducts from Sonora and Sinaloa
are imported through Nogales.
It has a tine trade on the West
Coast of Mexico and in the min
ing and agricultural districts ad
jacent to the city.
Nogales now has two daily
newspapers, one published in
the evening and one in the morji
ing. It is connected by daily
tiain service with Tucson and
the main line at Benson. Stages
carry many passengers between
Tucson and Nogales over the
splendid highway which con
nects the two cities.
Housing is a great problem in
Nogales as it is in Tucson. The
line city has grown so rapidly
that building has fallen behind,
particularly during the war. No
gales needs both more homes
and more business blocks. These
w;ll come during the period of
reconstruction.
Tucson is glad to see Nogales
prosper. It is a strong and
heaithy outpost for the Old Pue
bio. It will always be a good
town. It will continue to grow
and prospar. Its geographical
location is in its favor and its
pYogressive citizenship is pre
pared to take the fullest advant
age of its situation. Citizen.

MARK SMITH RETURNS HOME.
TUCSON, April 2. Senator
Mark A. Smith arrived in the
city from Kentucky yesterday
morning at 4 o'clock and is
stopping at the Old Pueblo club.
In the afternoon lie called upon
a number of friends and wher
ever he stopped on the sidewaHc
to giet an old friend there
a group, welcoming the senior
Arizona senator home. Senator
Smith iff looking well, his rest in
the state of Kentucky, imme
diately following the adjourn
ment of congress, evidently hav
ing don? him much good.
"I feel like a schoolboy on
Saturday morning," said the
the senator, "wondering if he
can get away to the old fishing
hole before dad commands him
i to pull weeds."
The senator hopes to spend at
least a month in Arizona before 1
he is called back to Washington
to attend the extra session of
congress, the date of which is
problematical, depending upon
the date of the conclusion of
the peace treaty.
Senator Smith shied away
from discussing politics and mat
ters of state.
"I want to go fishing that's
what I want," rtesaid, and made
inquiries of friends about the
piscatorial possibilities of Roose
velt lake. It is probable he will
go fishing there while he is in
the state.
Senator Smith does not be
lieve there is any Bolshevik
menace in the United States.
The hewspaper are responsible
for the Bolshevik histeria in the
United States, by playVig up on
the front page the utterances of
a few demagogues and foreign
agitata tors.
Joe Spires reminded the sena
tor that every man who ever op
posed him in the senator pri
maries, has passed over to
where there is no politics, an.d
reminiscence proved the truth of
the assertion.

NOTICE TO CREDITORS.
Phoenix, April 1. That the
state of Arizona will have avail
able on July 1 for the fiscal yearj Rxecntrlx,
beginning at that time the fol
lowing amounts for the construc
tion of the highways is contain
ed in a report made by Thomas
Maddox, state engineer, ;to the
Phoenix Chamber of Commerce:
Prom the tax levy. $900,000;
from the auto tax license, $160, -000;
from prison labor fund, $60,
000; from emergency appropria
tions, $200,000; Williams to Clark
dale road, $25,000; Arrowhead
Trail appropriations, $50,000;
bridges and approaches appro
priation, $155,000. Most of this
is contingent on a like amount
from the counties, or, if all the
road appropriation bills became
laws, approximately $1,750,000.
"There is almost $1,000,000 of
federal aid available immediate
ly and $1,300,000 next year, or a
total of $2,300,000 up to July 1,
1920," says Lieutenant Maddox
in his report.
"The state will not have the
funds to meet all of this federal
aid which requires an equal
expenditure by this state, but
our various counties will be glad
to double their road funds by
securing federal aid; we expect
more requests from the counties
for federal aid than can be allot
ted and we intend to recommend
those which are on the through
state routes and benefit the most
people. No federal aid will be
lost to the state.
"The passage of senate bill
185, which was old senate bill 17
minus the emergency clause,
would have increased the state
road funds some $600,000 addi
tional, but might have resulted
in the loss of several of the spe
cial road and bridge appropria
tions, so I would judge that we
are not short over $300,000 or
$400,000 of the amount original
ly planned, which means a re
duction of about 10 per cent on
the $400,000,000 which will be
spent the coming year under
state direction and control.
"We will need the time be
tween now and July 1 to prepare
surveys and plans for judicial
expenditure of funds then available."

The readers o tins paper will be
pleased to learn that there is at least
one dreaded disease that science has
been able to cure in all its stages, and
that is catarrh. Catarrh being greatly
influenced by con.stitutional conditions
requires constitutional treatment.
Hall's Catarrh Cure is taken internally
and acts thru the Blood on the mucous
Surfaces of the' System thereby de
stroying the foundation of the disease,
giving the patient strength by building
up the constitution and assisting na
ture in iloing Its work. The proprie
tors have so much faith in the curative
powers of Hall's Catarrh Cure that
they offer One Hundred Dollars for any
case that it fails to euro. Send for list
of testimonials.
