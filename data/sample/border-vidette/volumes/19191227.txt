The Spirit of
This store looks upon its patrons not
merely as customers but as friends.
People purchase here because they
have friendly feeling for this store.
The cause which develops this friendly
feeling, may differ, in fact, they are
sure to differ. One's friendship for
the store is the result of finding good
values; another's is the result of effi-,
cient service and courteous treatment,
and so on.
Naturally this friendshiply feeling on
the part of our patrons is reciprocated
on our part. And this spirit of mutual
friendship is an impetus for greater
service and an incentive to ever-increasing
endeavor to make this store
a place where every visitor will feel
perfectly at home.

had obtained a verbal agreement
from Secretary of Agriculture

and Secretary in Chicago last
month.
The work will be commenced
with a survey of agriculture in
the Santa Cruz valley near Tuc

He said the result of such a sur
vey would probably be a warn

ency cotton.

quarters during the past month
have been in Tucson. The prin

Aver, of Sargent, W. H. Roche,
of Los Angeles and Wess Eads
of King City, California.
The cattle, representing an
average of $45 per head of cattle,
or a total of $225,000, were
driven to this city for loading

ARIZONA DATES ARE THE BEST
Phoenix. -That Arizona dates
are the best in the world is the
opinion of Ozora S. Davis, presi
dent of the Chicago Theological
Seminary of Chicago, prominent
middle western churchman and
a man who has traveled exten
sively. Mrs. F. J. Wren, of 133
East Pennington street, sent the
Chicago divine a box of dates
some weeks ago from this city
and his answer is convincing.
I thought I bad tasted dates,
he writes. I never had. I
opened the box and then sampled
the contents. Is that what you
grow in Arizona.' it surely is
the most wonderful fruit I have
tasted."

FEDERAL BUILDING SITE.
Mr. Charles V. Fowler, of the
Young Business Men's Associa
tion of Nogales, has received
the following interesting letter
from Senator Ashurst, regard
ing the poposed federal building
site:
Washington, D.C.,Dec.l4, 1919
Mr. Charles V. Fowler, Chair
man Young Business Men's
Association, Nogales, Ariz.
My Dear Sir and Friend:
I have received your letter of
the 29th. ulimo. Your under
standing of the matter is cor
rect; the site has been selected
at the corner of Court Street
and Grand avenue, and some six
thousand dollars additional have
been subscribed and guaranteed
by the citizens. The only thing
that is now holding it up is the
fact that the department has
asked the railroad company to
bid and the department states
that in fairness they must give
the railroad company a reasona
able time to do so before pro
ceeding to condemnation, and
furthermore if they should be
compelled to resort to condemna
tion, it would serve to delay
matters that much longer. So
the Department feels that all
things considered, the railroad
should be given a reasonable
length of time to reply.
I trust this will cover your in
quiry and I might add that the
Department assures me that
everything will be done that can
possibly be done to expedite the
matter.
Cordially yours,
HENRY F. ASHURST.

The Woman's Tonic
"I took four bottles,"
Mrs. Jones goes on to
say, "and was not only
greatly relieved, but can
truthfully say that 1 have
not a pain. . .
" It has now been two
years since 1 tookCardui,
and I am still in good
health. . . I would ad
vise any woman or girl
to use Cardui who is a
sufferer from any female
trouble."
If you suffer pain caused
from womanly trouble, or
if you feel the need of a
good strengthening tonic
to build up your run-down
system, take the advice
of Mrs. Jones. Try Car
dui. It helped her. We
believe it will help you.
