Items of Interest Culled From Our
Exchanges .
A new Baptist church in Buck
eye in the near future is atnoug
the possibilities. The matter is
now being discussed by those
interested. Dr. Thayer, of
Phoenix, we are informed, has
offered to donate a splendid site
if the people of Buckeye will
build a suitable structure this
spring or summer. Buckeye

The first bars of gold bullion
produced by the big mill of the
United Eastern were brought
into Kingman yesterday and
shipped to the mint. While
nothing could be learned from
the management as to the value
of the bars, it was authoritatively
learned from other sources, that
the cleanup of the two weeks'
run of the mill amounted to the
handsome total of $55,000.
Persistent rumors that the
famous Vulture mine is ready to
start up again have been float
ing around for some weeks.
This mine, discovered in the
early sixties, has had a wonder
ful history, and is credited with
having produced many millions
of dollars some reports say as
high as $71,000,000, but this is
probably in excess of the gross
values extracted from the ore.
The bill introduced by Sen
ator Winsor to enable the state
tn loan mnnfit for imnrovement
of land that is not improved but
i i valued at more than $10 an
acre, is a good measure. It will
assist the noor man to establish
a home and the security is of
the bast when limited to half
the appraised value. Any im
provement makes the risk dou
bly safe, besides it creates
homes and taxable wealth.
While the steam railroad con
tinues to be the favorite convey
ance for long distance travelers
touring the Far West, lots of
travelers chauffeur there by auto,
regardless of tire troubles and
longer time required. The Grand
CaD.yon of Arizona was visited in
1916 by 31,358 persons. Of this
number 26,292 came by rail on
the Santa Fe and 5,129 by auto,
for the most part stopping off en
route to or from California.'
Oa Wednesday, several pieces
of school land located in Paradise
valley were sold at public auc
tion. Price secured was in many
cases ten times the appraised
value. One section of raw land
in Paradise valley brought $13,
050. Most of the land sold from
$20 to $30 per acre. None of
these lands are under canal.
Water must be supplied by
pumping or by water cource to
be created in future. In Para
dise valley, the Rio Verde dam,
should it be built, would im
pound ample water for that sec

Kingman can boast of more
modern facilities than many
other towns several times its
size, and in this respect the
opening of the new offices of the
Oatman - Kingman Brokerage
company in the lobby of the new
Hotel Beale is a step that should
command the attention of the
general public. In addition to
its regular stock market quota
tions, the concern now receives
daily reports and quotations of
the New York curb coppers,
Chicago grain market, Los An
geles stock exchange and metal
market.

are replacing the poles in town
and vicinity, with heavier ones.
The are several parties engaged
at different points along the

Arizona has 500 square miles
.of coal lands, located principally
in Navajo, Apache and Coconino
counties. The fields are ap
parently equal to those now
being worked so extensively
in New Mexico. There has not, as
yet, been a demand for opening
the Arizona fields.
Mrs. Marsh, of Santa Cruz
county, has introduced a lengthy
bill that received especial con
sideration from the chief clerk.
It abolishes the state board of
control and substitutes a board
of public welfare, constituted of
the governor, the state examin
er and a third person, who shall
not hold any office in the state
and who shall be secretary and
purchasing agent. The new
board shall keep the accounts of
the public institutions, including
the university and normal
schools, and shall purchase for

Charged With Salting Mine.
When the superior court ad
journed last evening the jury
had been prepared for the trial
of Joe Martinez, who is accused
of having salted a placer mine
in the Quartzsite district. It is
the first case of the kind ever
tried in Yuma county, and on
this account will arouse a great
deal of interest. Henry C.
Kelly is attorney for the defen
dant and yerterday was quite
thorough in the examination of
jurors, indicating that he is going
to make a hard tight for his
client.
Martinez was arrested on com
plaint of M. M. Hubbell, and
bound over by Justice A. G.
Grossman of Quartzsite, before
whom the preliminary hearing
took place.
It is alleged in the complaint
that Martinez attempted to de
fraud M. M. Hubbell, and James
H. Atkins, who are working the
Oro Pine placer mine on lease
and bond contract, and who are
prospective purchasers of the
property, by placing gold among
goldbearing ore The judgment
of Justice Grossman recites that
the defendant "deliberately
stood over a hole in the Oro Pine
placer diggings and threw gold
into the hole in order to make
such gravel show up id values
and defraud said M. M. Hubbell
and others who now have the
ground under bond with the ex
pectation af purchasing same if
such group shows high enough
values to justify them." It is
further stated that Hubbell and
another witness were in hiding
and saw Martinez "throw the
gold into the hole."
Salting a mine is a felony in
this state. Yuma Sun.
The Game Law Respecting Quail.
By section 654 of the Arizona
Criminal Code, the seasonsor
different kinds of game were
fixed and among them "Quail,
from October 15th to February
1st." The generic term Quail
alone is used, and none of the
different species were designat
ed. By the law enacted by the
people at the polls last Novem
ber it is provided: "That Sec.
654 of the Penal Code of Arizona
be and the same is hereby am
ended so as to read as follows:
The new or changed seasons and
bag limits are then set out and
when Quail are reached, the
words used are "Gambels or
Valley Quail from October 15th
to December 31st." Now we
have, according to naturalists,
the Gambels, the Valley, the
Scalebreast or Wbitetop and the
Fool Quail. While the statute
treats Gambels and Valley Quail
as one and the same, sportsmen
and naturalists know they are
separate and distinct. Gambels
quail only being designated it
must follow that the other spe
cies are not included and hence
are not protected. Ex.
BUILD NEW DORMITORIES.
Heads of State Educational Institu
tions Favor Them.
Popular among the requests
shown in this year's session of
the legislature are those for dor-
i mitories, a dormitory for boys of
j the Northern Arizona Normal
School; a boy's dormitory for
Tempe Normal School, and a
j dormitory for boys and another
j for girls at the University of
Arizona. These requests bring
to mind the question as to whe
ther the state should provide
dormitories in its several institu
tions or whether the students of
these institutions should seek
lodging away from their cam
puses. It seems to be the unanimous
opinion of the heads of our state
institutions that dormitories are
essential in Arizona. The period
of a college education is usually
the period during which the
student enters into his own re
sponsibilities. It is the most im
portant time of his life, the time
when the breaks loose from
home ties and is the caretaker of
his own money. There is pro
bably nothing more important
than the association of that boy
during the period from 17 to 21
years of age. He begins to see
life from a new angle; it is the
period of development from the
boy to the man.
The University of Arizona fully
realizes its responsibilities, in
this particular, but is under a
decided disadvantage. At the
University are two groups of
students, those living in the dor
mitories and those elsewhere.
Those on the campus are in close
association and friendship with
forty or fifty other students,
many of whom are working their
own way. They see thriftiness,
and are encouraged to practice
it. They are housed with stu
dents who are studious, and they
see the value of studvand follow
Tead; they are housed with stu
dents who have acquired leader
ship themselves.
The students living off the
campus have none of these in
spirations they live alone, or
with one or two other fellows,
and while the University exer
cises supervision over all stu
dents, whether or not they live
on the campus, to see that they
are not led into bad habits, the
difficulty comes in being unable
to lead them into good habits.
This is one of the big advant
ages of dormitories.
Another matter of material im
portance is the cost. Whereas
the cost of a room in the dormi
tory at the University of Arizona
is $3 per month, it is impossible
in the City of Tucson to get a
satisfactory room for less than
$12 per month. This is really a
serious matter to most of the
students, as probably three
fourths, of them are working
their way through college. To
them it is a struggle to get an
education a dollar looks as big
as a cart wheel and $9 extra a
month means a great deal to
them. It means 36 hours of out
side, time that should be given
to study. Signal.

Talking Out First Papers to Becomi
Real Citizens.
In many parts of the country,
and especially in New York,
Chicago and the larger cities,
hundreds of Germans and Aus
trians have applied for first citi
zenship papers during the past
few days, since diplomatic rela
tions were severed with Ger
many. Nearly every editor who
publishes a paper in the German
language in the United States
has come out squarely for Amer
ica, the land of their adoption.
In so doing, they have shown
the loyalty that is due this coun
try i No doubt it is with sorrow
to many who were cradled in the
Fatherland, that this stand be
comes necessary. Nevertheless,
the oath of allegiance is binding
and most of them took that so
lemn vow in good faith.
Those who had not yet taken
out first papers, desired to ex
press their loyalty by so doing,
although the act makes them
subject to military duty. On the
other hand, should eventualities
ensue, these foreigners had
visions of the concentration
camps where they would neces
sarily have been quartered. But
whatever the cause, it shows
that these people came to this
country to cast their lot with us,
and in so doing they are ready
to assume the duties of citizen
ship, even to the extent of tak
ing up arms, if necessary, against
their relatives and friends in the
kingdom from which they came.
Of such blood and such senti
ment has this great nation been
made up from the civilized na
tions of the European countries.
This is the spirit of freedom of
which America can well feel
proud. The Messenger.
FARMER'S WEEK A SUCCESS.
The Annual Farmers' and
Housekeepers' Week, held by
the Agricultural Extension Ser
vice at the University of Ariz
ona, proved a great success,
says the Graham Guardian.
The total registration was
about 250, as compared with 168
last year. Farmers and farmers'
wives came to the meeting from
all parts of the State.
The lectures and demonstra
tions given were extremely prac
tical and instructive and at the
end of the week, when the farm
ers and their wives departed for
their homes, general expressions
of good feeling and satisfaction
over the affair were heard on
every hand.
The program was carried out
almost without exception as per
schedule and the speakers from
within the State and from ad
joining states responded as pro
mised.
A number of excursions were
Drovided the visiting farmers
and their wives. Annual meet
ings of the State dairy and swine
growers' associations were held
and the State Farm Improve
ment Association held an im
portant meeting.
The meetings held for the
women were the best of the kind
yet held in the State.
It was an all-round agricul
tural and home economics con
gress, crowded full with valu
able suggestions and up to date
pointers on how to make the
most of advantages of farming
and farm life. The event is an
annual one and all will have an
opportunity to return to the Un
iversity again next year.
Arizona's county salary law,
which divides the counties into
fourteen classes and puts one
county in each class, was declar
unconstitutional by the supreme
court in a decision handed down
Monday afternoon in the case of
Frank L. Hunt vs. Mohave
county. Huut was county asses
sor and brought suit to collect
his salary under the la ws of 1901.
The court holds the 1912 enact
ment of the legislature invalid
on the ground that it was special
and local legislation. County
officers who are not satisfied
with their salaries under the
present law and who have been
allowed assistants and expenses,
will have to refund the excess
over that allowed by the 1901
law in setling with the counties,

DOC" GUSTETTER SOME HOST.
Organization of Ancient Order of Snif
fers a Success.
At the elegant home of Dr. A.
L. Gustetter, on Nob Hill, there
was organized last Saturday
night, the ''Ancient Order of
Sniffers."
The organization is said to be
ten million years older than the
"Ancient Order of Cacti," the
oldest social organization any
ancient citizen of Nogales has
any knowledge of.
Fire Chief Bracey Curtis, E.
K. Cumming, Ed. Titcomb, Wirt
Bowman, Jimmie Edwards, Col.
Bird, Sheriff Earhart, Judge
O'Connor, Captain Swartz and
a score of other officers, assisted
Mine Host Gustetter in the seri
ous and more or less painful
work of initiating a class of be
tween sixty and seventy men
into the mysteries of the order
more ancient than the "Order of
Cacti."
After the serious part of the
work was concluded, there was
fun atid frollic galore, and soon
the aches of mind and body were
forgotten by those who a short
while before had "faced death,
or worse."
The hit of the evening, was
the dancing by a lady from the
Hawaiian Island, after which
"eats" were served. Then the
first meeting of the "Ancient
Orderof Sniffers" abjourned, but
not' until the members thanked
"Doc" Gustetter for a most en
joyable evening. Those pressenj

Helps Dedicate New Santa Cruz River
Bridge.
Governor Thomas E Campbell
accompanied by Mrs. Campbell
arrived in Nogales on Wednes
day morning's train, and were
met by a delegation of ladies
and gentlemen headed by Mayor
H. M. Clagett and Mrs. Clagett.
As the governor's train rolled
in from Tucson, cannon on Cav
airy Hill boomed a salute in
honor of the state's de facto
governor, who came to partici
pate in the dedication of the
splendid new bridge across the
Santa Cruz river, of which Sen
ator Harry J. Karns is the
father. It was through the sen
ator's untiring efforts that the
legislature of which he was a
member, appropriated the money
necessary to build the magniti
cent structure recently com
pleted and dedicated last Wed
nesday. Governor and Mrs. Campbell
were guests of honor at The No
gales Cafe, and at 2 o'clock the
governor's party headed the
big motorcade out to the bridge,
where Chairman Robert E.
Lee of the entertainment com
mittee and the famous 12th
Infantry band ,welcomed them.
Ex Senator Harry J. Karns.
father of the bridge, was the
first speaker to address the large
crowd from Nogales, Patagonia
and others sections of the coun
ty, who not with standing the
cool, darnu weather, gave his
interesting revvarks careful at
tention. After Senator Karns came
Judge Henderson of Patagonia,
ex-member of the board of sup
ervisors, who expressed pride
and pleasure in having aided in
making the bridge possible.
Colonel A. T. Bird, on behalf
of the Nogales Chamber of Com
merce, made a few appropriate
remarks after which Governor
Campbell, who was given a
hearty welcome, for which the
speaker expressed his apprecia
tion and his great pleasure in
being present to assist in the
dedication of what he believed
to be one of the finest bridges in
the state.
Gov. Campbell, during his
splendid address, paid Sen
ator Karns a high compliment,
for his efforts in securing from
the state legislature the appro
priation for the bridge. He
suggested that the new bridge
should be called"Karns Bridge,"
not the "Santa Cruz Bridge."
Many of those present were iam
favor of the suggestion made by
Governor Campbell.
All agreed, however, no mat
ter what the name, the bridge
was "the best ever," and well
worth the price. The Governor
and Mrs. Campbell motored to
Tucson, thence to Phoenix.
While here they met many
friends.

OUR MOTTO:- "THE
AMBASSADOR BONILLAS.
Well Known Nogales Citizens Repres
ents Mexico in Washington.
Washington, D. C, Feb. 12.
Ignacio Bonillas, one of Carran
za's representatives on the Mexican-American
joint commission,
has been named as Mexican am
bassador to the United States.
Ramon Denegri, who has been
in charge of the Mexican em
bassy since the departure of
Elizeo Arredondo, ambassador
designate, was informed today
of Mr. Bonillas' appointment.
Mr. Bonillas in now at Palm
Beach, Florida.
It is expected he will come to
Washington this week to present
his credentials, at almost the
same time Henry C. Fletcher,
the American ambassador is re
ceived in Mexico. After the fail
ure of the Mexican-American
commission to effect an adiust
ment of the questions at issue
between the two governments,
Mr. Arredondo was called to
Mexico. It was understood at
that time that Mr. Bonillas would
be chosen as his successor, al
though Mr. Arredondo insisted
that he would return to his post.
Mr. Bonillas has been the min
ister of communications in Gen
eral Carranza's cabinet since the
formation of his government
and is one of the few men who
is reputed to have the entire
confidence of General Carranza.
He was educated at the Massa
chusetts Institute of Technology
and married an American
woman.
Don Ignacio Bonillas and his
interesting family for many
years made Nogales, Sonora
their home. At the present
time the Bonillas residence, just
across the international line, is
the most elegant on the Mexican
side.

of confirmation. It was under
stood that the Democratic mem
bers, Buchanan of Pima, Mattox
of Navajo, Sutter of Cochise,
Campbell of Coconino, and Ru
therford of Yavapai would vote
for confirmation. Since then,
Mattox was won over to the
Hunt side, though only as to this
matter, which he said, he regard
ed as purely political.
Just before a vote was called
on the first nomination, that of
Johnson, Mr. Sutter said, that it
was not the purpose of himself,
or, he believed, any other De
mocratic senator, to vote for
confirmation. He had only desir
ed that the matter might be
finally disposed of in an orderly
manner and according to the
rules."

Matt Quenner, generel man
ager of the New York McAneny
Consolidated Mines company,
has returned from the company
property to spend a few days
with his family in Douglas, says
the Douglas Dispatch. Mr. Quen
ner, says the company is getting
ready to put in a large steam
shovel to handle the over burden
on the property. A Quenner
crushing machine has been in
stalled and will be in operation
shortly. The company is operat
ing in the placers at Greaterville,
not far from Patagonia.
Tom Gardner is having ore
hauled down from his lease from
the Duquesne company this week
for shipment to the smelters.
His lease is on the California,
San Antonia and Arizona claims,
from which he is shipping some
splendid copper and silver lead
ores. The copper goes to the
smelter at Douglas, while the
silver-lead ores are shipped to
El Paso. His lease will be up

son, has been surveyed and

proval. It is the intention to
annex the sub-division to the
Patagonia townsite. It is a very
desirable residence section, and

these lots The tract has been
very appropriately named "The

RIGGER SANTA RITA.
leager Will Build Annex to Big Tucson
Hotel.
That L. J. F. leager would
erect an addition to the Santa
Rita hotel at a cost of $150,000,
was stated yesterday by John
Mets, on behalf of Mr. leager,
who left yesterday for San
Francisco to confer with an ar
chitect over plans for the addi
tion. Mr. Mets assisted Mr.
leager in the financing of the
annex but otherwise is not in
terested in the proposition, says
Tuesday's Tucson Star.
The annex or addition, accord
ing to Mr. Iaeger's plans, will
contain 100 rooms, and will be of
concrete, being fireproof. It will
be constructed as a unit to the
present building and will con
form to the general architecture
of the Santa Rita. It will be
erected on the lot immediately
south of the Santa Rita on Scott
street, the lot being owned by
Mr. Iaeger. It has a frontage of
72 feet.
It is Mr. Iaeger's intention to
start the work immediately, it is
said, in order that it may be fin
ished in time for the next "tourist
season." .
The building of the annex will
help in relieving the scarcity of
hotel accommodation in Tucson
and have been at this season for
several years, despite the fact
that not nearly so many winter
visitors come here as formerly.
With the revival of publicity
work by the chamber of com
merce, the demand for accom
modations will probably more
than take up the hotel capacity
of the city, projected and plann
ed. The letjal instrnnipnts concern
ing the financing of the Satita
Rita annex were signed yester
day and Mr. Iaeger immediately
left for San Francisco to confer
with architects regarding the
plans for the building.
