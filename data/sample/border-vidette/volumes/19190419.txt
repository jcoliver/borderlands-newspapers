the Eureka, which will be con
tinued to a greater depth. Mr.
Jaeger brought in some fine
looking silver-bearing ore Wed

IN HONOR OF OUR BOYS.
Soldiers. Sailors and Marines Will
Be Entertained Monday.
Kntertainment of the returned
soldiers, sailors and marines, of
Santa Cruz county, will begin in
thia city at 1 o'clock Monday
alternoon with the largest,
grandest, mo-t superb parade
that the residents of this city
have ever st-en, says the Herald.
It" is proposed to make the
parade the longest procession
that has eer been seen in this
city. Kvery automobile in Santa
Cruz county, and many others
from other parts of the state,
will be in the line of march. All
of the soldiers, sailors and mar
ines of this county who partici
pated in the late World War,
and all of those who have seen
former service in the American
army, navy or maiine corps will
also be there.
And in addition all of the
troops stationed at Camp Ste
phen L. Littles will be in the
procession; and there will be
hundreds of men, women and
children, those who were never
fortunate enough to fight for
their country, bringing up the
rear. It is expected that there
will be very few sigthseers as
everyone who can walk will be
in the procession, and those who
cannot march will be in the au
tomobiles. It is planned to have the No
gales chapter of the Red Cross
society represented; and all of
the mothers, wives and sweet
hearts of the soldiers will be
there carrying service flags. The
parade will be tha best that No
gales has ever seen.
Joy is to be the watchword of
the day, and no effort is to be
spared to have everyone joyful.
Following the parade there
will be a band concert and ad
dresses in the piaza, and a little
later in the afternoon there will
be a ball game at the new ball
grounds.
Every effort will be made to
make everyone have a good
time.
At night, there is to be the
free dance, and free eats in the
Santa Cruz Club rooms, and the
overflow dance in the tire station.
Everything is free and every
body in the State of Arizona,
particularly those living in San
ta Cruz county are invited to
attend the doings.
PRIVATE PEAT.
Private Peat, the famous little
Canadian author and lecturer
who comes to Chautauqua on the
sixth night, was recently asked,
"What is the most tender thing
you ever saw a soldier do?"
Here is his answer: "After the
first gas attack at Ypres, in
April, 1915, I was knocked out
for a while and was in the clearing-station
at Merville. One
day, when I was lying there on
a stretcher, a poor, miserable
soldier came in. He was cover
ed with mud and blood. He was
minus his overcoat, and his tunic
was torn by schrapnel. He was
soaked to the bone, for it was
raining, and he was shivering
with cold and pain. The nurse
hurried to him, and asked him
what had become of his over
coat. "Oh," he said, his teeth
chattering, "my pal was killed
back there, and he looked so
cold, lying in the rain. I took off
my coat and put it over him."
Last Monday afternoon Noga
les Lodge, Order of Eastern
Star, entertained at luncheon, at
the Nogales Cafe, Mrs. Parr,
Worthy Grand Matron of the
order, whose home is in Wins
low. In the evening a recep
tion in honor of the distinguish
ed guest, was held in the Ma
sonic Hall. Mrs. Parr is mak

Star.

Why You Can Afford to Invest in Vic
tory Liberty Loan.
Dallas, Tex., April IT). Secre
tary of the Treasury Glass, in a
statement issued yesterday, an
nounced that the Victory Liber
ty Loan which will be offered
for popular subscription on April
21, will take the form of four
and three quarters per cent,
three or four year convertable
gold notes of the United States.
The four and three quarters
per cent notes will be exempt
from state and local taxes, ex
cept inheritance and estate taxes,
and from regular federal income
taxes. Undoubtedly these are
the notes that will be chosen by
most of the purchasers in this
distiict. However, should any
one desire to convert these notes
into three and three quarter per I
cent notes this may be done.
There are two kinds of notes
and they are interchangeable.
The three and three quarter per
cent notes will be exempt from
state and local taxes, also from
all federal taxes except estate
and inheritance tax, this being
attractive to wealthy people.
The amount of the issue will be
four billion, live hundred million
dollars. The notes of both series
will be dated and bear interest
from May 20, 1919 and will mat
ure on May 20, 1923. Interest
will be payable on December
15th, 1919 and thereafter semi
annually on June 15th and De
cember 15tb.
At maturity the dates upon
which payments will be required
on the notes are as follows: ten
per cent with application on or
before May 10, ten per cent on
or before July 15. twenty per
cent on or before August 7,
twenty per cent on or before
November 9, twenty per cent on
or before October 7, twenty per
cent on or before November 11,
with an accrued interest on de
ferred installments.
Payment in full can be made
on May 20, ten per cent required
with application having been
duly paid on or before May 10
payment can tlso be completed
on any installment date with
accrued interest.
The Eleventh Federal Reserve
District has been assigned the
lowest percentage of quotas of
all districts, the percentage as
signed being two and one tenth,
so there should be no question
about the full amount being ab
sorbed promptly.
