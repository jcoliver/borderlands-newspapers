Sunday, February the Ninth, 1919, As
Roosevelt Memorial Day.
The death of Theodore Roose
velt is a world loss. As night
brings out the stars, the passing
of this ex pres dent, statesman,
and scholar has brought into
bold relief those traits of heart
and mind which endeared him to
the American people and made
him an international figure. Am
ericans are not a race of hero
worshippers but they are ready
to pay homage to such men as
Theodore Roosevelt concerning
whom it has been said with
truth:
"Strong of will, big of heart,
intense of purpose, great in his
enthusiasms, large in the num
ber and quality of his achieve
ments, extraordinarily convinc
ing in speech, accomplished in
writing, of a versatility of mind
remarkable, and with an active
imagination, loving his friends
and his cause with equal ardor,
he held the friendship, the con
fidence and the affectionate re
gard of millions of his country
men. When German aggression
became uncovered he took his
stand of uncompromising loyalty
and became the great prophet
of Americanism. He was the
most potent force to arouse Am
erica from her lethargy and in
difference; his was the demand
tor preparedness; his was the
voice that called to arms."
He was not only a great man
but a national inspiration, rais
ing the standard in American
political lile and by precept and
example changing the mental
attitude of the people and in
stilling in them the true obliga
tions of citizenship. His char
acter, lugged and energizing
made a peculiar appeal to the
West. His iove for this broad
expanse of country with it's pro
mise of future greatness beyond
the ken of human understanding
round lasting expression in that
great engineering achievement,
the Roosevelt Dam, the living
waters of which have made glad
the heart of the Salt River Val
ley and caused the desert to
blossom like the rose.
To Theodore Roosevelt more
than any other one public man
can be attributed the bringing
irto being of that national con
sciousness which has demanded
that the Flag shall follow those
who claim allegiance to it and
protect the rights of person and
property in every part of the
world .
Typical of a more forceful and
better race, a strong and virile
people backing right for right's
sake and ready to champion the
cause of the oppressed, he fore
shadowed the dawn of that great
dy:
"When the war drum shall throb
no longer
And the battle Hag is furled
In the parliment of man
The federation of the world."
It is therefore meet and prop
er that as a nation and a state,
we should pause and pay tribute
to our Peerless L-eader who, al
though departed this life, has
left a marked impress upon his
country's life and history. The
Congress of the United States
has set aside Sunday, February
the ninth as the day when it
shall conduct services in his
honor.
Now Therefore, I, Thomas E.
Campbell, Governor of Arizona,
by virtue of the authority vested
in me by law do hereby set aside
Sunday, February the ninth as
Roosevelt Memorial Day and
urge the people of the various
communities on that occasion
through the medium of public
meetings and church services to
pay honor to the memory of this
Great American.
In Witness Whereof, I have
hereunto set my hand aud caus
ed the Great Seal of the State of
Arizona to be affixed.
Done at Phoenix, the Capitol,
this 31st day of .January, 1919.

PROCLAMATION OF ARBOR DAY
BY THE GOVERNOR OF
ARIZONA.
Whereas, It is provided by law
that the Governor annually by
Proclamation set aside a certain
day to be known and observed
as Arbor Day:
Whereas, It is fitting that the
love of Nature inherent in all of
us should find expression in the
planting of trees, shrubs and
vines, in the promotion of forest
and orchard growth and culture,
in the adornment of public and
private grounds and " the orna
mentation and beautitication of
the environments of our schools
and colleges, private and public;
Now, Therefore, In conformity
with the" provisions of para
graphs 2837 2840, Chapter XX
of the Revised Statutes of Ari
zona, Civil Code, I, Tbomas E.
Campbell, Governor of Arizona,
do hereby designate and set
apart Friday the 7th day of
February, 1919, as Arbor Day,
to be observed in the Counties
of Cochise, Gila, Graham, Green
lee, Maricopa, Pima, Pinal, San
ta Cruz and Yuma; and siinilarly
I hereby designate and set apart
Friday, the fourth day of April,
1919, as Arbor Day for dqe ob
servance in the Counties of Apa
che, Coconino, Mohave, Navajo
and Yavapai.
In view of the ending of the
great world conflict and the turn
ing of our thoughts from blood
and iron to those things in life
which make"" for culture and the
cultivation of the esthetic, Ar
bor Day of 1919, is endowed
with special significance. I would
therefore recommend a general
observance of Arbor Day and
that not alone the pupils in our
schools but those of older years
participate in exercises and the
planting of trees, shrubs, vines
and flowers to the end that the
various communities of the state
will be more beautiful places in
which to live.
In Witness Whereof, I have
hereunto set my hand and caus
ed the Great Seal of the State
of Arizona to be affixed.
Done at Phoenix, the Capitol,
this 31st day of January, 1919.
Thomas E. Campbell,
(Seal) Governor of Arizona.
Attest: Mit Simms,
Secretary of State.
By R. E. McGillen,
Asst. Secy.
Mr. Hiram Whitcomb, general
manager of the World's Fair
Mines, was in town this week,
and reported the new mill in fine
working order. Shipments ot
f i
concentrates are steadily going
out, together with high grade
ore, which is evidence that the
company is turning out the metal.
INCOME TAXPAYERS.
Collector Franklin has been
informed by the department at
Washington that the Internal
Revenue Bureau is arranging to
furnish for the benefit of Income
Taxpayers in every city and
town in the country, a free ad
visory service by trained collect
ors, agents, inspectors and de l
puties. At the offices of Col
lectors and their Deputies, and
at other central points, free in
formation and advice with re
spect to filing returns under the
new Revenue Bill may be had
up to the final date for filing
such returns.
Banks, trust companies and
similar responsible institutions
have always co operated in fur
nishing authentic Income Tax
information, and have generous
ly offered to serve the govern
ment and taxpayers in this re
spect again this year.
It is the aim of the Bureau to
bring its agencies as close as
possible to every person and to
make available in every official
form all necessary information
regarding the requirements of
the law. The Bureau welcomes
aid from every responsible agen
cy in its effort to enlighten the
people on tax matters.
Every taxpayer is assured that,
the action of the Government
will be based entirely on the tax
laws and regulations and the
facts in his case. No other in
fluence is allowed to enter into
Internal Revenue matters and
the statement of any firm or in
dividual that .they are in a posi
tion to exert specib.1 influence
with Internal Revenue officers is
wholly without foundation.
Painstaking and open-minded
consideration is given in every
case regardless of whether the
taxpayer appears in person or
by attorney.
MINES AND MINERS.
It is reported that the north
ern mining states are now talk
ing southern Arizona, and it is
expected that many new parties
will be coming into this district
this spring.
Messrs. McDonald, Ismond
and LeVonte, operating the
Hosey property, recently broke
into some fine copper silver ore.
They have been working entire
ly in shipping ore for sometime,
and the new strike means a
great deal to the property.
The Trench mine encountered j
several rich stringers in the j
cross cut from the 750-foot level, j
They have 00 feet to drive be- J
fore cutting their main ore body, j
and encountering these string j
ersggives strong evidence that j
they will encounter a large ore
body.
Fred. Smith and Charles Falk,
operating a lease on the Mowry
ground, are getting some fine
ore. They are sinking a shaft
upon the west extension of the
famous Mowry contact.
The Patagonia. Engineering
and Assay Office reports sampl
ing the largest carload of con
centrates ever sampled. The
car was loaded with 85 tons of
the product of the Flux mine.
The Pierce-Gardner lease is
shipping regularly. They have
installed a gasoline hoist, have
a new skid rig in the shaft and
have resumed sinking. With
the increased hoisting capacity
the property can now double its
tonnage of ore for shipment.
The Hardshell mines began
grading away for the surface
plant for the new shaft which
they will sink immediately. The
shaft was sunk about 60 feet fey
the owser, and the present op
erating company contemplates
sinking it to the 350 foot level.
Mr. E.E.Bethel, general man
ager of the Washington Trading
Company, has secured an option
on the Ivanhoe property. Mr.
Bethel and parties interested ex
pect to start work on this one
time producer within a short
time. It will be remembered by
the "old boys" that the Ivanboe
shipped some very rich copper
silver ore in the days gone by,
and there is no reason why it
should not repeat the perform
ance. The property has an ex
cellent equipment and the mine
is in good condition to start
work upon. Patagonian.
Give Mining An Even Chance.
Now that the war is over,
many restrictions on mining de
velopment should be removed.
Owing to government orders
large producers were restricted
and many small producers sus
pended entirely.
Restrictions were necessary in
order to win the war, and the
mining industry responded with
superb patriotism.
Thousands of skilled men and
mining engineers were taken out
of development work and sent
to the front to help win the war.
Thousands of mines suspend
ed production and development
work to meet the aoverument's
demand for man power.
These mines suspended finan
cial operations and closed up
their properties until after the
war and put their money Into
the war.
All restrictions hindering le
gitimate development should
now be removed and let the
work of opening new mines go
ahead. ARMY AND NAVY UNION.

Exports from this country since It
entered the war have kept starvation
from Allied Europe and have main
tained the health and strength oftho.se
uo nave Deen bearing the brunt of,
our battles, so that they could hold
out to victory. Now that hostilities
have ceased we must assume the add
ed burden of keeping starvation from
Increasing Its toll upon the millions
Mho have been liberated from the
Prussian yoke. Famine, would undo
the work which has been accomplished
in freeing the world for democracy. Xo
stable government can be established
anti maintained ly a nation harassed
by hunger. A starving people turns
to rioting and anarchy. Food bus
given strength and courage to the na
tions fighting for democracy ; it must
now give the nations strength nnrl
tranquillity to re-establish themselves
in ireedom and democracy.
witnout our nelp it would have been
absolutely impossible for the Allies to
maintain a living ration. Since our
entry into the war we have been con
tributing largely to the support of one
nunured and twenty million people
normal rooti supplies have been
cut off, whose production has fallen
almost to the vanishing point, whose
fields have been devastated by Ger
many. The food exported from the
United States In the past year has
been sufficient to supply ihe complete
ration of twenty-two million people.
It is hard to grasp the magnitude
and significance of the assistance
which lias been lent the Allies b. the
patrio.i.-. voluntary service of the
Arerrlcan people. The food we sent
abroad last year would have been suf
ficient to feed one-fifth of our popula
tion. Arid ibis was done in spite of
the fact that we entered th rmr ..th
short crops. Our surplus was practi
cally nothing. An overwhelming pro
portion of the food that left this coun
try last year was saved out of (he nor
mal home consumption oV our own
people.
In spite of difficulties met In Inter
nal transportation and shortage of
ocean tonnage our food exports last
year amounted to a figure that a few
years n;ro would have been unbelieva
ble. Kven the most optimistic element
oi our population faced with anxious J
consternation the prospect which
opened lu-rui-e us with the beginning
of the 1917 harvest year.
The American people have not been
compelled to save. They have been
appealed to on the basis of humanity
ami of patriotism. They have re
sponded voluntarily.
