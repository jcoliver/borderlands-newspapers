The cause which develops this friendly
feeling, may differ, in fact, they are

the store is the result of rinding good
values; another's is the result of effi
cient service and courteous treatment,
and so on.
Naturally this friendshiply feeling on
the part of our patrons is reciprocated
on our part. And this spirit of mutual
friendship is an impetus for greater .
service and an incentive to ever-increasing
endeavor to make this store
a place where every visitor will feel
perfectly at home.

Items of Interest Culled From Our
Exchanges.
Pima county has sold her last
issue of road bonds and scon
will be busy on an extended
county highway system that will
connect up her already cctnplet
ed roads with several vitally
needed exits and inlets to that
county, notably the one from
Vail to the Pima Cochise county
line, and it is said she will soon
get a line to Ajo that will be
"worth while" and it will lop otT
quite some distance to the coast.
Fresh agitation has been start
ed over the issuance of $2,000,
000 in county bonds for the im
provement of the county's main
thoroughfares, such as to Plor
ence, on a part of the Border
land road that now is in very
bad shape, to Agua Caliente on
the way to Yuma, northward to
ward Prescott, on the Black
Canyon-Wickenburg routes, and
to help in the betterment of ne
cessary highways nearer Phoe
nin, in Maricopa county.
Hon. Mulfcrd Winsor has been
appointed by Secretary of the
Interior Lane on the committee
to prepare a report for the State
of Aiizona giving information
regarding l.ind available for the
locating of returning soldiers,
as outlined by the Department
of Agriculture. Each state will
be required to submit to the
Secretary of the Interior a re
port giving information regard
ing land available for this pur
pose. In view of the early re
turn of troops it is necessary
that the report for the state of
Arizona be prepared at once -Yuma
Sun.
Mr. P. B. Blake of the recla
mation service is very anxious
to begiu trying at the earliest
possible moment to have a Y. M.
C. A. building in Yuma so that
when the work begins on the en
largement of the irrigation pro
jeet in connection with the Yu
ma and Imperial Valley situa
tion, there will bo a place in
which the young men who will
necessarily make their head
quarters in the town, can spend
their spare time. Also he has
in mind the return of the over
seas soldiers, and it is hoped
that a movement in this direction
can be started in a short time.

From Information received by ttasi

now possible Lo announce with fair ac
curacy the amount of wheat saved last
harvest by improved methods of nan
tiling. According to official cnlcufcs

saved fully 10,000.000 bushels of wheat
with corresponding savings of other
small grain harvested and threshed In
a similar manner. In addition, otheia
states, though unable to furnish fig

losses.
The figure for wheat alone Is equiv

GOOD SCHOOL WORK.
Prof. Madden of the Nogales Schools
Educates Through Newspapers.
In order that the time may not
be lost during the quarantine,
the High School and the upper
grammar grades will be asked
to prepare assignments made
through the daily papers and to
report to the teachers at speci
fied times in two's and three's.
This is an effort on the part of
the school to keep the work go
ing and the success of the un
dertaking will depend to a large
extent on both pupils and par
ents. The school can not exer
cise the usual control over the
study of the pupils and the par
ents are called on to encourage
and facilitate the work of study
in the home. If the pupil and
parent arrange a certain part of
each day for the pupil to spend
in preparing the assigned less
ons and each makes an effort to
see that time is not interfered
with in any way, the lessons can
be prepared. But if the parent
is indifferent and does not see
that the home assignments are
given this time for study and
that the study is really done we
cannot hope to accomplish any
thing by this effort. In this re
gard we know that there is as
much difference between parents
as there is between pupils.
Those parents who are vitally
interested in the education of
their children will see that this
work is done and that their pu
pils report to their teachers at
the proper time. May we not
consider this an index to the in
terest the parents have in the
education of their children f
Pupils should watch the pap
ers daily for the assignments.
Friday's assignments will ap
pear in Wednesday afternoon's
paper and Monday's assignments
will appear Thursday afternoon.
Also, Friday's assignments will
appear in the Thursday's morn
ing paper, and Monday's assign
ments Friday morning.
The days on which pupils are
to report to teachers will appear
only once in each paper, so each
pupil should make note of the
day in the week and the time of
the day he is to appear and al
ways appear exactly on that day
and time.
Anyone not able to report be
cause of sickness or some other
urgent cause should notify the
office by telephone and the ex
cuse will be given to the teach
er. Those who have difficulty
with some part of the assign
ments can make arrangements
with the teacher of that subject
to meet the teacher at an ap
pointed time for help.
Pupils should not come on the
school grounds until the hour
they are to report to the teacher
and after their appointment they
will be required to pass off the
grounds.
Any pupils who have not al
ready taken their books should
call for them. No state text
books must be taken until the
teacher makes a record of them.
If the quarantine lasts for
sometime it may become neces
sary to make two divisions of
classes, where possible, when
school opens again. In one divi
sion will be those who have pre
pared their assignments and re
ported to teachers and in the
other divisions will be those who
have neglected to study.
Parents cannot blame the
teachers if their pupils are not
placed in the higher division,
due to the fact that parents and
pupils have neglected to con form
to the requests made regarding
this home study. In case of a
long quarantine, it will be im
possible to complete the work of
the grade unless this home study
is done. In this case thosa fail
ing to do home study and there
by failing to get into the higher
division may have to complete
the work next year when school
opens. G. H. Madden.

BERT SORRELLS IS DEAD.
News of the death of E. B.
(Bert) Sorrells, at St, Joseph's
hospital last Wednesday, was a
shock to this community, where
deceased and his family have a
wide circle of friends. Pneumo
nia resulting from the flu, was
the cause of the sudden, untime
ly passing of one of the county's
best known, most successful live
stock raisers.
Bert Sorrells was a member of
one of the oldest pioneer families
of this section, where he resided
with bis family since he was a
mere boy. With his parents,
Mr. and Mrs. A. B. Sorrells,
Bert came to Harshaw, this
county, from the state of Arkan
sas, where he was born forty
two years ago.
With his brothersRay and Roy,
he prospered in the cattle busi
ness, and at tbe time of bis
death, Sorrells Brothers were
among the big successful stock
raisers in this section. Last
week they moved a thousand
bead of white face cattle from
their range in Santa Cruz coun
ty, to the Buena Vista ranch in
Sonora owned by Don Manuel
Mascarenas, for better pasture.
The cattle were crossed by agree
ment between the United States
and Mexican governments.
Bert is survived by his mother
Mrs. A. B. Sorrells, his widow
and four little children, three
boys and a girl, who reside at
the old ranch home of Senator
J. A. Harrison, out near tbe
Buena Vista ranch, a few miles
from Nogales; two brothers, Roy
and Ray, and two sisters, Mrs.
George N. Sayre of San Fer
nando, and Mrs. Peter Bergier,
of Patagonia.
In their hour of terrible sor
row, the bereaved family, have
the heart felt sympathy of every
body in Santa Cruz county. Bert
Sorrells was a man among man.
He will be missed.
The funeral was held yester
day afternoon, from the Metho
dist church, interment being in

Increase in All Respiratory Dis
eases After the Influenza
Epidemic Probable.
Influenza Expected to Lurk for Months.
How. to Guard Against Pneumonia.
Common Coids Highly Catching Im
portance cf Suitable Clothing Could
Save ICO.CGO Lives.
Washington, D. C. With the subsid
enco of the epidemic of influenza tli
attention of lien I til officers is directed
to pneumonia, broneultis :ii!I other
diseases of the respiratory system
which regularly cause n lni-e number
of deaths, especially during the winler
season. According to Rupert Blue,
Surgeon General of (he United States
Pulille Health .Service, these (discuses
will he especially prevalent this win
ter unless the people are particularly
careful to obey bealUi Instructions.
"The present epidemic," said Sur
geon Generiil lilise, "baa taught by hit
ter experience how readily a condition
beginning apparently as a slight cold
niny go on to pneumonia anil death.
Although the worst of the epidemic is
over, there v.ill continue to be a large
number of .scattered cases, many of
them mild and unrecognired, which
will be danger spots to he guarded
against." The Surgeon General likened
the present situation to that after a
great fire, saying, "So tire chief who
understands Ids business stops playing
the hose on the charred debris as soon
as the names and visible fire have dis
appeared. On the contrary, he con
tinues the water for hours and even
days, for he knows that there is dan
ger of the lire rekindling from smol
dering embers."
"Then you "fear another outbreak of
Influenza?" he was asked. "Not neces
sarily another large epidemic," said
the -Surgeon General, "but unless the
people learn to realize the seriousness
of the danger they will be compelled to
pny a heavy death toll from pneumo
nia and other respiratory diseases.
Common Colds Highly Catching.
"It Is encouraging to ohserve that
people are beginning to learn that or
dinary coughs and colds are highly
catching and are spread from person
to person by means of droplets of
germ laden nitidis. Such droplets are
sprayed Into the air when careless or
Ignorant people cough or sneeze with
out covering their mouth and nose. It
is also good to know that people have
learned something about the value of
fresh air. In summer, when people
are largely out of doors, the respira
tnrv diseases (couehs. colds, nneurao
nla, etc.) are Infrequent ; In the fall,
as people begin to remain Indoors, the
respiratory diseases increase; in the
winter, when people are prone to stay
In badly ventilated, overheated rooms,
the respiratory diseases become very
prevalent
Suitable Clothing Important.
"Still another factor in the produc
tion of colds,-pneumonia and other re
spiratory diseases Is carelessness or ig
norance of Hie people regarding suit
able clothing during the seasons when
the weather suddenly changes, silting
in warm rooms too heavily dressed or,
what is even more common, especially
among women, dressing so lightly that
windows are-kept closed in order to be
comfortably warm. This is a very in
jurious practice.
Could Save 1C0.COO Lives.
"I believe we could easily save one
hundred thousand lives annually in
the United States If all the people
would adopt the system of fresh air
living followed, for example, in tuber
culosis sanatoria. There is nothing
mysterious about it no specific medi
cine, no vaccine. The important thing
is right living, good food and plenty of
fresh air.
Droplet Infection Explained in Pictures.
"The Bureau of Public Health,
Treasury Department, has Just Issued
a striking poster drawn by Berryman.
the well-known Washington cartoonist.
The poster exemplifies the modern
. method of health education. A fey
years ago, under similar circumstances,
the health authorities would have is
sued an official dry but scientifically
accurate bulletin teaching the role of
droplet infection In the spread of re
spiratory diseases. The only ones whm
would have understood the bulletin
would have been those who already
knew all about the subject. The man
in the street, the plain citizen and the
many millions who toll for their living
would have had no time and no desire
to wade through the technical phrase
ology." .
