OUR IfiOTTO:- "THE BEST OF EVERY! HIKG."
ARMY OFFICERS HONORED.
Guest of Chamber of Commerce and
Santa Cruz Club.
The patriotic reception and
soo'al dance given Monday night
at the Santa Cruz Club by the
Chamber of Commerce and San
ta Cruz Club members, hi honor
ol officers of the 10th Cavalry,
the 12th Infantry and the 35th
Infantry, U. S. A., was highly
enjoyed by all.
Ad dresses of welcome were
made by Superior Judge W. A.
O'Connor, Attorney Prank J,
Barry and Colonel A. T. Bird,
vice president of the Chamber of
Commerce, who were followed
by Mr. Nick Polyhrone, popular
proprietor of the Nogales Cafe,
a veteran of the Balkan war,
who told of the loyalty of Greeks
in America, to their adopted
country and the stars and stripes.
Mr. Polyhrone said:
Ladies and Gentlemen: I have
been asked to say a few words
to you tonight with reference to
500,000 of countrymen now liv
ing within the borders of the
United States of America, and.
moie especially with reference
to the thoughts and ideas of my
people and t heir allegiance to the
Stars and Stripes your flag
our flag.
It is interesting in this regard
and I am proud to say, that in
the present unpleasantness there
comes from my people, a frank
and open offer of allegiance, the
offer of personal service. It is
a matter of recorded history now,
that no less than 35,000 Greeks
living in the United States ten
dered unconditionally their per
sonal services to their Dew conn
try. No great wonder or sur
prise was felt or expressed by
the learned women and men of
the world at this actioa on the
part af my people for it may be
conceded hat i n spirit and in ac
tion, the Greek is essentially
democratic. The smouldering
in the hearts of the people of
Greece against autocratic form
of government, burst violently
into flame when King Constan
tine, proving himself to be in
deed a worthy brother in law of
Kaiser Wilhelm, Germany's God,
violated the sacred rights of my
people and their democratic con
stitution and cast a stain on the
honor of Greece, who had known
at that time, no dishonor by
holding the Serbian pact as
naught, emulating Kaiser Wil
helm who said that treaties are
merely a scrap of paper. And
this ladies and gentlemen, in
spite of the fact that the nation's
invading Servia, that is Bulga
ria and Turkey, have always
been the Greek nation's most
bitter enemies.
But Bulgaria and Turkey were
and are the allies of Germany
and remember King Constantino
is the brother-in-law of the Ger
man Emperor, Kaiser Wilhelm.
This action on the part of King
Constantine brought about the
resignation of the Premier Vene
zelos, who, at the head of two
thirds of the Greek nation, set
up and declared the existence of
a separate government of Sal
onica, Greece, and has been
fighting Germany and the auto
cratic government she repre
sents. The Greeks realize in this
world wide titanic struggle that
there is but one principle in
volved and that either autocratic
government and all it represents
will emerge victorious and su
preme or that democratic gov
ernment and all it represents
will emerge victorious and su
preme The hearts and services
of the Greek people are with
you and there are within the
boundaries of the United States
today, 60,000 Greek veterans of
the Balkan wars, who will enlist
to support the Stars and Stripes.
Allegiance, gentlemen! Liber
ty is the symbol of the Grecian
flag. It is the symbol of our
flag the stars and stripes.
Speaking for America's Grecian
citizens, Mr. Polyhrone, said.
We pledge allegiance to our
flag;
And to the Republic for which
it stands;
One nation indivisible.
With liberty and justice for all.
At the conclusion of the ad
dresses, dancing was enjoyed
until midnight, excellent, manic
being furnished by the'12th In
fantry orchestra.
WHY GUNS ARE USEFUL.
Many Americans are asking
whether it is any use to mount
Koch on merchantmen whether
armament really makes ships
and crews any safer against sub
marine attacks. The practical
value of guns for such a purpose
has been admirably explained by
Winston Churchill, iu a speech
made in the British house of
commons when the British ad
miralty began to arm its ships.
"The object of putting guns
on a merchant ship," he said,
''is to compel the submarine to
submerge. If a merchant ship
has no guns, a submarine with a
gun is able to destroy it at
ieisure by gunshot and we must
remember that on the surface
submarines go nearly twice as
fast as they do under water.
Therefore, the effect of putting
guns on a merchant ship is to
drive the submarine to abandon
the use of a gun, to lose its sur
face speed, and to fall back on
the much slower speed under
water, and the use of the tor
pedo. "The torpedo, compared with
the gun, is of much more limit
ed application. The number of
torpedoes which can be con
structed in a given time is itself
subject to certain limits. Any
trained artilleryist or naval com
mander can hit with a gun, but
to make a submerged attack
with a torpedo requires a much
higher degree of skill and training."
PINAL COUNTY ROUGH RIDERS.
In response to the call for pre
paredness the entire country has
been aroused to patriotic action
and in every part of the Union
daily 'demonstrations of patrio
tism occur, showing that the
whole country is united solidly
to back up President Wilson in
maintaining the honor of the
nation. In the event of actual
land hostilities Arizona, Texas,
New Mexico and California will
undoubtedly be called udou to
guard the Mexican border against
invasion and border warfare
with their national guards and
volunteer regiments.
Already steps are being taken
for rough rider regiments in
these states and S. O. Thomp
son, ex supervisor of Pinal coun
ty and cattleman, is among the
first to call for volunteers for a
Pinal county troop of rough
riders. All cowboys who wish
to become members of the Pinal
county troop of rough riders
should send in their names to
Mr. Thompson at once. A troop
on a war footing consists of 128
officers and men. This number
should be easily obtained in Pi
nal county, which can be relied
upon to furnish her full quota
of a regiment, but only those
are desired who are ready to
rough it when roughing is ne
cessary, and that is apt to be
pretty much all the time, for
those who must have a cot to
sleep on at night will have little
chance of being accepted as rough
riders. Florence Blade.
RANGES SHOW IMPROVEMENT.
The Secretary of Agriculture
has authorized the Forest Su
pervisors of Arizona and New
Mexico to issue grazing permits
for 1917 aggregating 466,000
cattle and horses, 881,000 sheep
and goats, and 25,000 swine.
The number of cattle and
horses is 10 per cent greater
than last year, and the number
of sheep and goats 5 per cent
less, according to Paul G. Red
ington, District Forester. The
net increase is figured to be
equivalent to 36,000 cattle.
In the opinion of the grazing
specialists of the Forest Service,
this represents roughly the
year's improvement in the carry
ing capacity of the National
Forest ranges.
The increased capacity is as
cribed to the development of
water by stockmen on hitherto
dry ranges, bettor handling and
distribution of stock, the gradual
elimination of overgrazing, and
the prevention of tire.
MEN WANTED.
Gov. Campbell Calls All Arizonans ot
18 to 4-5 to Colors.
Acting on order of Governor
Campbell, County Assessor L.
E. Smith yesterday issued a call
for every man in Tucson between
the ages of 18 years and 45 years
inclusive, to appear at the court
house here tomorrow for enroll
ment in the Arizona militia, says
Tuesday morning's Tucson Star.
Similar action is being taken
in every county in Arizona.
Both citizens and those who
have declared their intention of
becoming citizens are included
in the call to the colors.
All Tucson men of the age
limits specified who fail to ap
pear for enrollment will be en
rolled by Assessor Smith with
out exemption.
Work of enrollment is expect
ed to proceed for several days.
Any legal exemption which may
be established to the satisfaction
of Assessor Smith will be noted
by him in forwarding the enroll
ment lists to headquarters.
What service the Tucson men
will be called upon to perform in
the war department's scheme of
things entire for the conduct of
the war with Germany, has not
been specified.
All employers in the city are
requested by Assessor Smith to
allow their employees sufficient
time Wednesday to go to the
court house and be enrolled.
Men refusing information, or
giving false information as to the
qualifications of themselves or
others, will be guilty of a mis
demeanor, and will be prosecut
ed, says Smith.
Governor Campbell's calling of
the great mass of the states' citi
zenry to the colors is in accord
ance with paragraphs 3891 of
the Revised Statutes of Arizona
of 1913, which provide for such
action in an emergency.
ARIZONA NEEDS 1300 MEN.
EXYRA SESSION A PROBABILITY
Arizona May Undertake Part of Work
of Protecting Border.
There is a possibilty that
state of war may result in an
extraordinary session of the
legislature unless the national
government should take meas
ures for the protection of all the
states along the border. The
national guard becoming a part
of the federal organization and
being detailed for other duty,
it may devolve upon the south
ern states to lighten the burden
of the government by undertak
ing their own defense by the
organization of special forces.
For such a purpose it would
be necessary for the state to
issue bonds, but that could not
be done without legislative au
thority and in the present state
of the pubhc debt that could be
done only were the authority of
the following clause of Section
5, Article IX of the constitution:
"In addition to the above limited
power to contract debts (the
limit being $350,000), the state
may borrow money to repel in
vasion, suppress insurrection or
to defend the state in . time of
war; butthe money thus raised
shall be applied exclusively to
the object for which the loan
shall have been authorized or
to the payment of the debt the
reby created. No money shall
be paid out of the state treasury
except in the manner prescribed
by law.
BRINGS HERE FORDS TO ARIZONA
Arizona may draft men if ne
ccessary to furnish the full quota
needed to raise the first Arizona
Infantry to war strengh, accord
ing to Adjutant General Harris.
Harris has issued a statement in
which he said that 1300 men
would be needed to complete
the First Infantry, the organiza
tion designated by the war de
partment as the one to be ac
cepted from this state. "I sin
cerely hope we will immediately
have enough voluntary enlist
ments so that it will not be ne
cessary to draft to furnish our
quota," said Harris.
Recruiting offices have been
nnonoH in Phnoniv Tnrxann
Douglas and Yuma. Men will not 1
be accepted who have persons
dependent upon them for sup
port unless they can pass the
physical examination required
for the regular army.
Jesse Li. Gatlin, whose cattle
ranch is 6 miles south of Pata
gonia in Santa Cruz county,
bought from W. R. Franklin of
El Paso, Texas, 260 head of pure
bred coming yearling Hereford
bulls and heifers. Half of them
are bulls and the other half are
heifers. These calves are out
of registered stock from the
Luke Brite herd of thorough
breds at Marfa, Texas, and are
a fine bunch.
Mr. Gatlin is considering an
offer of $60 for the bulls and $50
for the heifers. They are easily
worth the money and when turn
ed loose on any of our ranges
they will sure leave their mark
in years to come. They are be
ing sold because the owner has
not quite enough rangeat pres
ent to accommodate all of them.
If he does not accept the present
offer he will keep the heifers and
part of the bulls any way. Mr.
Gatlin already has a splendid
herd of Whiteface stock on his
range and is increasing it all the
time. Arizona Cattleman.
Benson Citizen Force Allien to Salute.
Word reaching Tombstone yes
terday from Benson is that a
rancher living near Benson who
has a young daughter attending
the grammar school forbade her
to salute the flag as required
when taking part in the school
exercises.
News having gotten about of
his disloyal attitude and of al
leged disparaging remarks about
"Old Glory," he was waited up
on by a committee of citizens
who demanded a public retrac
tion by a salute to the flag at
the school house Monday morn
ing, with the option of leaving
the community in the meanwhile
if such a course seemed prefer
able. He chose the former, and in
the presence of quite a crowd
gave the required salute, and
the incident was closed. Prospector.
Ray and Roy Sorrells of Pata
gonia, have decided to hold their
yearling steers until fall. They
weaned most of their calves
earlv and the late sorintr has put
' them back, so that they do not
nife snipping tnem out tin tney
' have had the benefit of the
j summer feed, which will be
I plentiful and their stock will be
' in tine shape for fall deliveries.

Jimmy Douglas is to be com

ier. To show their spirit toward
the University and the general
preparedness movement, the
men of the upper classes of the
University of Arizona are form
ing a company to be added to
the University battalion in their
work of training men for their
country. These men will vol
unteer their services to Colonel
Brown as third and fourth year
men, as only two years is requir
ed by the university, and will
drill with the rest of the bat
talion.
The Cattleman has a letter
from a stockman at Dickens,
Texas, who writes that himself
and several neighbors are com
ing to Arizona to look over the
country to buy cattle ranches.
These people have sold out their
cattle ranches because their
land became too valuable for
cattle range purposes and have
selected Arizona for new loca
tions. They expect to be in Tuc
son about the 15th of April and
will look over the country from
here. They will want ranches in
price from S15.000 up. Anyone
having ranches for sale will do
well to communicate with Frank
M. King, 127 West Congress
Street, Tucson, Arizona.
Mexico is too busily engaged
trying to solve local problems to
have any desire to enter into the
international fray. There is no
evidence that Carranza has in
trigued with either Germany or
Japan with a view to offering
asylum to enemies of the United
States. No intellectual Mexican
has any vision of ever securing
any portion of the domain that
long since passed to this coun
try. To retain what they alrea
dy possess is the big question
with which Mexico is wrestling.
In order to survive, the repub
lic to the south of us has been
shielded by the Monroe doctrine,
and to the United States, as the
big brother, all Latin America
looks for protection. Feather
brained reporters are responsibe
for the idle rumors afloat. The

she writes: "I had a
general breaking-down
of my health. I was in
bed for weeks, unable to
get up. 1 had such a
weakness and dizziness,
. . . and the pains wero
very severe. A friend
to 1 me I had tried cvery
th ig else, why r.ot
Cardui? ... I did, and
coon saw it was helping
me . . . After 12 bottles,
I am strong and well."
Do you feel weak, diz
zy, worn-out? Is your
lack of good health caused
from any of the com
plaints so common to
women? Then why not
give Cardui a trial? It
should surely do for you
what it has done for so
many thousands of other
women who suffered it
should help you back to
health.
Ask some lady friend
who has taken Cardui.
She will tell you how it
helped her. Try Cardui.
