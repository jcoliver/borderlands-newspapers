Senate bill 50 is an act to
amend revised statutes of Ariz
ona 1913 and pertains to shorten
ing of the time of publishing
notice of improvements. Muni
cipalities will not have to publish
notice of local improvements in
a- daily paper over five times
and in a weekly paper but twice.
The southeasterly end of the
Tom Reed estate, known locally
as the Aztec workings, and the
Big Jim mine, which adjo'ns the
Aztec Center claim on the west,
are developing one of the big
gest deposits of gold ore in the
west an orebody that would be
considered phenomenal in any
other district but Oatman.
The United Eastern mine at
Oatman will produce something
like 1,725,000 in the next year
of the average for the last thirty
days is maintained. Since the
mill was put into operation in
January the United Eastern has
shipped more than 6000 ounces
of gold, valued at $75,000. The
main three compartment shaft
is down 665 feet and it is expect
ed that it will cut the vein at
950 feet.
Attorney General Jones calls
attention to the fact that "ever"
since the governor's proclama
tion of December 13th, last, de
claring capital punishment
abolished in Arizona by vote of
the people, the board of pardons
and paroles has had no power
to recommend any murder cases,
and the matter, therefore, rests
wholly with the governor to act
as he pleases, without any re
commendation from the board of
pardons and paroles.
Among the bills signed by
Gov. Tom Campbell Wednesday
night was House Bill No. 4,
known as the red light abate
ment bill which makes it illegel
to rent property for purposes of
prostitution. Another bill signed
was House bill No. 34 introduc
ed by Mrs. Pauline O'Neill and
known as the "Bone Dry" mea
sure. It prohibits the introduc
tion of liquor into the state and
even prohibits a paper within
the state boundaries from pub
lishing liquor advertisements.
The Yuma valley of Arizona,
under national reclamation has
forged rapidly to the front as
one of the rich and fertile re
gions of the southwest. The
change from the old haphazard
mehtods which prevailed during
the period when private irriga
tion systems were operated to
the present condition of intensive
and practical farming under the
government canals, is marked.
This change is particularly
gratifying to the Raclamation
Service at Washington, D. C.
Warning against the activities
of one J. B. Collins, who is said
to have been representing him
self as insurance agent for the
North American Accident In
surance company of Chicago
wa& issued this week by the in
surance department of the Ariz
ona corporation commission.
Collins, the warning says, has no
license from the state insurance
department, nor is he licensed
to represent any insurance com
pany operating in Arizona. Col
lins is said to have operated
considerably in Flagstaff and
Jerome and other points in
northern Arizona.
For the first time in many
years strontium ore has been
marketed from deposits in the
United States, according to J.
M. Hill, of the United States
Geological Survey, Department
of the Interior. Most of the
ore marketed in 1916 was produc
ed in Arizona and California.
The ore mined in the State of
Washington was not marketed.
The domestic output was equal
to about 10 per cent of ordinary
demand, which amounts to 2000
tons. The British embargo on
strontium salts need cause little
disquiet among American users,
for abundant ore is no doubt
available in this country, and
certainly American chemists
have shown that they can profit
ably make the salts needed
here.
MEXICANS TO CONTROL LANDS
Mexico has adopted a new
constitution and has ratified the
same. Last Sunday elections
were held and Carranza chosen
president by a large majority.
The vote cast is the heaviest one
ever known in Mexico. Through
out the republic, so far as known,
the election was regular and or
derly. The new constitution is liberal
but it tends to keep ownership
of all lands in the hands of Mex
icans as is evidenced by the fol
lowing section:
Only Mexicans, by birth or
naturalization, and Mexican com
panies, have the right to acquire
control of lands, waters, and
their accessories, or to obtain
concessions for exploiting mines,
water, or combustible minerals
in the Mexican Republic. The
government may concede the
same right to foreigners, provid
ed always that they agree be
fore the secretary of foreign re
lations to consider themselves
as nationals with respect to such
property, and not to invoke pro
tection of their home govern
ments for anything relating to
it, under penalty of forfeiting to
the nation whatever they may
have expended on their conces
sions. Iu a belt 100 km. (60
miles) wide along the frontiers
and 50 km. wide along the sea
coasts, foreigners may not ac
quire property in lands or waters
under any pretext.
IV. Commercial corporations
issuing shares may not acquire,
possess, or operate rural estates.
Such corporations, which are
formed to exploit any manufac
turing, mineral, or petroleum
industry, or for any other non
industrial purpose, may acquire,
possess, and operate lands only
to the extent which may be strict
ly necessary for the installation
and performance of their in
dicated objects, as determined
by the executive" of the nation,
or of the states, as the case may
be. Messenger.
SPRING SHOOTING PROHIBITED.
The U. S. Department of Agri
culture has received inquiries
from many sportsmen in the
middle west in regard to spring
shooting of waterfowl. In re
sponse the department has made
the following public announce
ment: Under the federal regulations
there is a closed season from
February 1 to September 6, in
clusive, each year throughout
the United States on waterfowl
and other migratory game birds.
The season for hunting is further
restricted in various parts of
the country to periods not ex
ceeding three and one-half
months. The open season on
waterfowl in the states of Ohio,
Indiana, Illinois, Iowa, Nebras
ka, Kansas and Missouri is from
September 16 to December .31,
inclusive, and it Is unlawful to
hunt or kill waterfowl in those
states at any other time. Per
sons committing violations of
the regulations may be prosecut
ed at any time within three years
after an offense is committeed.
Army Cantonment Buildings for Yuma.
According to the blue print
plans for the army cantonment
buildings in Yuma which are
now circulating among local
contractors and mechanics, there
are to be 21 buildings all told,
to cost approximately 1000 each.
These buildings are to be most
ly modern, frame structures, all
save one to contain nine rooms.
There will be one building for
the junior officers, 50x126 feet
in dimensions, the largest one
proposed. All buildings are
known as officers' quarters. In
the regimental officers' buildings
there will be double bath rooms.
There are four classes of struc
tures, designated A, B, B 1 and
C. Each structure is to be light
ed by electricity and provided
with modern plumbing. It is
thought that construction work
will soon ba commenced. The
first move, however, will be the
securing of a site for the build
ings, and a movement is on foot
in that direction at the present
time. Sun.
FIFTY-THREE YEARS AGO.
Arizona's First Governor's Farewell
Message to Legislature.
On the ninth day of November.
1861, Hon. John N. Goodwin,
the first governor of the Terri
tory of Arizona, addressed the
following farewell message to
the legislature at the conclusion
of its deliberations:
"In reply to a message from
the legislative assembly, inquir
ing whether I have any further
communication to make, it gives
me pleasure to inform you that
all business requiring your
attention has been submitted to
you, and I have only to express
my full appreciation of the dilig
ence and wisdom with which
your labors bave been prosecut
ed and of their great value to
the territory.
"The task before you was,
indeed, one of no ordinary dif
ficulty. Since its acquisition by
the United States, the territory
has been almost without law or
government. The laws and cus
toms of Spain and Mexico had
been clashing with the statute
and common law of the United
States and questions of public
and private interest had arisen
which demanded careful but
decided action. These questions
have been met and satisfactorily
settled. No portion of the terri
tory has been overlooked and no
interest of its people has been
neglected. In addition to the
ordinary business of the session,
a complete code of laws has
been adopted; one which will
meet all the wants of our young
commonwealth and will compare
favorably with the statutes of
the older states.
"You have been in session
forty-three days and a greater
amount of labor was never per
formed by a legislative body in
the same time.-
"I congratulate you on the
harmony and good feeling that
have characterized your delibera
tions. At a time when political
feelings are strongly excited,
you have suffered no party dif
ferences to distract your proceed
ings and divert your attention
from the important work before
you. You can now separate
with the consciousness that your
duties are performed."
In a subsequent address to the
legislature, made on the occasion
of the tender to him of a vote of
thanks "for the able, efficient
and impartial manner in which
he has discharged the ardous
duties ot speaker of the house
during the present session," W.
Claude Jones, the first presiding
officer, said:
"You have been orderly, so
ber, active and industrious, and
your deliberations have been
directed with an enlightenment
of intelligence. You have gone
with an energy and with a will
into the business of the legisla
ture. You have worked unceas
ingly, and with great and good
results. You have accomplish
ed what no other territorial le
gislature has done before you."
Such was the condition in 1864.
At the close of the third state
session in 1917, fifty-three years
later, Thos. E. Campbell the
first de facto or makeshift gov
ernor of Arizona, made a felicit
ous address in which he com
plimented that body in no un
certain words. Arizona in a half
century has progressed, in fact
the appropriation bill in 1917
was larger than the assessment
roll of the territory in 1864. The
third legislature had something
tangible to begin with. Dili
gence and wisdom marked the
procedure and politics did not
prevent necessary legislation to
care for every interest in the
state. Arizona has taken no
backward step. Messenger.
Solve High Cost of Living With Home
Garden .
Why worry about the high
cost of vegetablts? If you have
a backyard why not get busy
and turn it into a garden? Why
pay outrageously high prices
for onions, potatoes, cabbage,
beans, peas, and all the other
vegetables when with a few
ceuts worth of seeds, a few
square feet of ground and a lit
tle healthful outdoor work you
can produce your own garden
1 products? Never was there a
time when the planting of gard
ens, was calculated to interest
so many people. The high cost
of living has brought things to
such a pass that the "average
family will absolutely be com
pelled to grow vegetables in the
backyard or on adjoining vacant
lots this year. Vegetables make
up half the cost of. food for sum
mer consumption in most fami
lies. By careful selection of
seeds from a reliable seed house,
and a little planning as to the
arrangement of beds, the aver
age head of a family can make
his backyard a profit-yielding
area. The amount of labor re
quired in the ordinary city gar
den is not such as to take much
time from even his periods of
recreation, and the exercise gain
ed digging and delving in the
ground is always benefical. Ex
change. CONGRESSMEN COMING.
The Members of the Committee
on Indian Affairs of the House
of Representatives who were
elected to the 65th Congress
have recently departed from
Washington on a tour of investi
gation which will include most
of the Indian reservations in the
southern and southwestern
states. The condition of the
Seminole Indians in Florida will
first be examined into, and then
the Choctaws of Mississippi will
will be looked over. Tne Com
mittee will then proceed to Okla
homa where the large and varied
interests of the Indians of the
State will receive attention.
After leaving Oklahoma the
next stop will be in Arizona
where the last week in March
will be spent in traveling over
the various reservations. Con
gressman Carl' Hayden, who will
accompany the committee on this
tour, is particularly anxious to
have a number of Indian irriga
tion projects in his state care
fully investigated.
The following Members of
Congress will visit Arizona: Hon.
Charles D. Carter, of Oklahoma;
Hon. Philip P. Campbell, of
Kansas; Hon. Carl Hayden, of
Arizona; Hon. Patrick D. Nor
ton, of North Dakota; Hon. John
N. Tillman, of Arkansas; Hon.

In addition to the Members of
the Committee the party include
Mr. Paul N. Humphrey, Clerk
of the Committee on Indian
Affairs, and Mr. H. B. Smith,
Reporter.
BAN ON DICE BOXES.
About thirty-three business
establishment of this city, most
ly cigar stores and fruit stands,
must throw away their punch
boards, dice boxes, and all
other contrivances dealing with
games of chance, before their
doors open this morning, says
Tuesday morning's Tucson Star.
Chief of Police Bailey announc
ed last night that strict enforce
ment of the city ordinance
against all gaming devices will
begin today. Warning to this
effect was issued ten days ago.
No contrivance where the ele
ment of chance in any way en
ters will be permitted for candy,
cigarettes, cigars or any other
form of merchandise to which a
definite value can be said to exist.
The ten day notice was given
in order to enable local mer
chants to get rid of unpunched
chances on their boards. Though
many boards only partially
punched will be thrown into the
discard today, the dealers state
that they will lose little or noth
ing, as the wholesale houses ex
tend them a rebate on the un
punched numbers.
A penalty of from $25 to $100,
or jail sentence of from 25 to
100 days, is provided for viola
tion of the ordinance.

Amado Station Will Remain in
Cruz County.
Santa
Through the prompt action of
a committee from the Chamber
of Commerce, the removal of
Amado Station from Santa Cruz
to Pima counties was prevented
Wednesday at the hearing held
in Amado by Corporation Com
misioner Betts.
Citizens of Pima county had
petitioned for the removal of the
station into their county claim
ing that Amado was inconven
iently situated. The committee
from Nogales consisting of
James A. Harrison, chairman of
the Board of Supervisors, J. B.
Bristol, J E. Wise, C. V. Fowler,
W. J. Neumann and A. T. Bird,
presented a strong argument in
favor of the retention of the sta
tion in this county which was so
decided by the Corporation Com
missioner. The Southern Pa
cific company agreed to rebuild
the corrals and roads in the vici
nity of the station which was the
main factor in saving the station
for Santa Cruz county. The
railroad company will spend
about $9,000 in repair work
which is a saving of about $6,
OOO.that amount being estimated
as th3 cost of erecting a new sta
tion, corrals and rebuilding roads
in the vicinity of the proposed
station. Times.
The new building being put
upon McKeown avenue, to be
used as a garage by Hopkins
and Valles, is rapidly nearing
completion. It is about 40x70
feet in dimension, and large
enough to house many cars.
Bding constructed almost en
tirely of galvanized iron, it is
practically fireproof. In addition
to doing regular automobile re
pairing, in which both Messrs.
Hopkins', and Valles have had
considerable experience, they
will also secure the sub agency
for several different machines
in Patagonia. The new garage
is expected to be completed and
open for business some time the
latter part of next week. Pata

because the paper absorbs and
holds moisture. They assure
healthier and more beautiful

It Always Helps
says Mrs, Sylvania Woods, of Clifton Mills, Ky., in
writing of her experience with Cardui, the woman's
Ionic. She says further: "Before I began to use
Cardui, my back and head would hurt so bad, I
thought the pain would kill me. I was hardly able
to do any of my housework. After taking three bottles
of Cardui, I begp.n to feel like a new woman. I soon
gained 35 pounds, and now, I do all my housework,
as well as run a big water mi.iL .
I wish every suffering woman would give
The Woman's Tonic
a trial. I still use Cardui when I feel a little bad,
and it always does me good."
Headache, backache, side ache, nervousness,
tired, worn-out feelings, etc., are sure signs of woman
ly trouble. Signs that you need Cardui, the woman's
tonic. You cannot make a mistake in trying Cardui
for your trouble. It has been helping weak, ailing
women for more than fifty years.
