SEND YOUR EXHIBIT.
Getting together with an all
Arizona exhibit the State will be
well representee at the Interna
tional Soil-Products Exposition
at Peorra, Illinois, in September.
The last Legislature endorsed
the project for a suitable exhibit
of agricultural products. The
material which includes practi
cally everything that can be
grown in the state is now being
assembled at Phoenix for ship
ment. .Grains and grain sor
ghums of all kinds, spuds, cot
ton, fruits, vegetables, hay,
seeds, plants, in fact every item
that can be produced from the
soil is entitled to entry and to
compete for the individual prizes.
It is the aim of those in charge
of the exhibit to have as many
individual exhibit as it is possi
ble to gather, and for each in
dividual exhibit to have a dupli
cate in the Arizona State Ex
hibit. The samples of each arti
cle required need not be large
but the best that is grown should
be secured and sent to Phoenix
to be included in the display.
Competition is keen. Exhibits
come from all over the country
afid from Canada and foreign
countries.
There is no charge to the in
dividual for entering the exhibit.
It is only required that all ex
hibits reach the Chamber of
Commerce, express or freight
prepaid and accompanied by a
complete description of the arti
cle and the name and address of
the grower or exhibitor. Ariz
ona has been very successful at
all of these Expositions. Ariz

ita a lew years ago. Many prizes
were won at Denver, Tulsa, Ed

hibits and correspondence to

FORESTRY REGIMENTS NEEDED.
That several more regiments
of foresters and woodworkers
will be raised for service in
France is officially announced in
advices received by the local
forest service office. To supply
trained lumber jacks, millmen,
teamsters, and foresters recruit
ing will be vigorously pushed
not only in New Mexico and Ari
zona, but throughout the United
States. Recruiting for a second
regiment has not yet started;
but to create a reserve for the
first regiment privates will con
tinue to be enlisted and sent to
the regimental camp.
Practical woodsmen subject to
draft but not yet called up for
examination are urged by the
listing officers to make applica
tion for the forestry regiment.
This regiment and others to fol
low, will supply lumber and
timber not only for the trenches
and for bridges and highways,
but for the great docks and
wharves needed for the docking
of American transports in the
ports of France.
Military Features at the State Fair.
The Arizona Council of De
fense has received a telegram
from W. S. Gifford, director of
the National Defense Council,
asking it to notify the Arizona
State Fair Commission to hold a
place on its program for pa
triotic and educational exhibits,
parades, and addresses on all
vital war matters. Many gov
ernment departments and bur
eaus will contribute displays and
demonstrations of unusual in
terest. The leading patriotic
societies of America and the
American Association of Fairs
and Expositions are co-operating
heartily in this work. A
number conferences are being
held in Washington this week
outlining many plans for the
program. Full information re
garding the national program is
expected within a few days from
Mr. Gifford, and will be turned
over at once to Mr. Zachau, sec
retary of the Arizona State Fair
Commission, to be used in con
nection with the State Fail- pro

Those who, before the United
States entered the war, thought
it better to remain neutral and
postpone until after the war the
settlement of differences with
beligerent nations, will have no
difficulty in recognizing the
change in the situation caused
by our own nation's entrance in
to the war. Had we remained
neutral we might have been able
to act as mediator and thus ren
dered an important se; ice to
the world. In entering e war.
however, we surrenderi i that
opportunity and incurred the en
mity of the central powers. A
new situation therefore, con
fronts us. We must not only
protect ourselves from those
who are now our enemies, but
we must find an opportunity for
world service in aiding to ar
range an permanent peace, built
on justice, liberty and demo
cracy. We must win. Defeat is in
conceivableit would be inde
scribably unfortunate if it were
possible. We cannot allow any
foreign nation to determine the
destiny of the United States
especially a nation committed as
Germany is, to arbitrary gov
ernment and militarism.
Neither can we afford to have
onr allies overcome that would
bring us to the disaster of de
feat or the burden of carrying
on the war alone.
We are in the war by the ac
tion of congress the only body
authorized to take the nation
into war. The quickest way to
peace is to go straight through,
supporting the government in
all it undertakes, no matter how
long the war lasts or how much
it costs.
We must win.
Any discord or division, aftar
the government has acted, would
prolong the war and increase its
cost in money and men. W. J.
Bryan in The Commoner.
Wandering Heir Sought by Friends.
Wandering somewhere oyer
the face of the earth, possibly in
Arizona, is Oscar Cameron, heir
to a vast estate, with lands,
money and plenty within his
grasp, could he but be reached
through the tenacles of detec
tive agencies stretching out to
him with hands dripping dollars.
For many months relatives of
Cameron have ransacked the
country, making their most
thorough searches in the mining
camps which are known to be
his haunts. All that is known
of the wandering heir to untold
wealth is that he is a miner by
profession, is single, : and is 43
or 45 years of age. Whether he
is living or dead is not known.
In a letter to the various banks
of Cochise county the adminis
tratrix, Mrs. Sarah Belle Brewer
of Walker, Iowa, asks that an
effort be made to locate Cameron.

Fort three strictly copper com
panies paid 8,897,000 in cash
dividends in the first six months
of 1917, bringing their total
dividends up to 932,008,089 dis
bursed out of operating profits
from the present properties of
these companies.
Against dividends of $87,897,
530 paid by the 43 copper com
panies, their operating profits
for six months past exceeded
101,500,000. This is after de
ducting income tax, and in most
cases depreciation, but not ex
cess profit tax. The dividends
paid amount, therefore to scarce
ly over half the profits earned.
The profits are calculated, as
suming an average of twenty
seven cents per pound for the
copper marketed.
The dividends total above
$43,000,000 for each of the two
quarters, exceeded any other
three month's record in history,
except the final quarter of 1916.

GAME BEING PROTECTED.
Game protection in Arizona is
being watched very closely, ac
cording to Robert A. Rodgers,
forest ranger in charge of the
Haachuca division.
"In a recent game law passed
by the state of Arizona, the
Haachuca mountains and that
vicinity were laid aside for a
breeding place in which animals
could secure protection from
hunters," said Rodgers. "Pew
people know that there is such a
law existing in the state, but if
they will takfi the trouble to in
quire at the United States forest
service here in town they will
find out a number of things we
are doing that would surprise
them."
Tbere are about 500 white-tail
deer in the Haachuca mountains
and the number is rapidly in
creasing. Hundreds of animals
from Mexico are coming over
the line to secure protection and
food in the United States. A
number ot wolves are also cross
ing the border and the forest
rangers are doing all that they
are able to prevent this immi
gration. Prospector.
