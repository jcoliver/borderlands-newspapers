have friendly feeling for this store.
The cause which develops this friendly

cient service and courteous treatment,
and so on.
Naturally this friendshiply feeling on

on our part. And this spirit of mutual
. friendship is an impetus for greater
service and an incentive to ever-increasing
endeavor to make this store
a place where every visitor will feel
perfectly at home.

An evidence that the camp is
becoming better known to the
mining fraternity is the fact that
each week sees new mining men
coming in and looking the dis
trict over carefully. Many of
these men are now operating
here.
This week James Layman and
W. E. Moore of Jerome, Ariz
ona, examined the Blue Nose
and Pierce-Gardner properties.
They left well pleased with the
district and anticipate returning.
Messrs. Layman and Moore
have successfully promoted some
of the largest properties in Je
rome and it is hoped that they
will make Patagonia their head
quarters in the near future.-
The Mowry is now so accus
tomed to opening up new ore
bodies that the developing of a
few thousand more tons of ore
makes but little impression upon
that camp. Everything is re
ported to be going along satis
factorily there.
Tbe new strike on tbe Pierce
Gardner property is holding out
beyond expectations. The ore
body is now 12 feet wide and
neither hanging nor foot walls
have been cut. The company
has purchased a larger hoist and
will soon have it installed and
can then mine a real tonnage of
ore instead of the usual 30O tons
a mouth output.
The Hardshell is rapidly get
ting its machinery set and will
soon be sinking the deep shaft.
A carload of machinery arrived
! for the Hardshell Tuesday even

gine, air compressor, rails and
pipe.
During the temporary shut
down at the World's Fair mine,
caused by the breaking of a
cylinder head in the engine, the
mill is being given a general
overhauling and when repairs
are completed operations will be
resumed at this rich property on
an even larger scale than here
tofore. Among other improve

a new K. and K. flotation separ

Under recent date Hon. Fran
cis J. Dyer, American Consul at
Nogales, Sonora, Mexico, issued
the following statement of in
terest to those doing business
with the United States War
Trade Board:
"Under date of April 16,1919,
the State Department advised
the American consulate in No
gales, Sonora, that a circular
would be issued on April 28th in
which tbe War Trade Board
would announce as effective on
April 29th the suspension of all
enemy trading lists, and the re
moval of all disabilities hereto
fore arising from inclusion of
such lists. All persons in the
United States will be authorized
ou and after April 29th to trade
and communicate with all per
sons abroad with home trade
and communication have been
prohibited By" the' trading: with
the enemy act, except that the
present restrictions against trade
and communication between the
United States and Germany, or
Hungary, will continue in effect.
Similar action will be taken con
currently by the Allied govern
ments. The foregoing action of
the War Trade Board, does 'not,
however, affect the status of, or
authorize trade with respect to,
any property which heretofore
under the trading- with-the-en-emy
act has been reported to the
United States Alien Property
Custodian, or which should have
been so reported, or any prop
erty which the alien custodian
had heretofore seized or required
to be transferred or delivered to
him. But this action does, how
ever, permit tbe establishment
of credit and the creation of
new assets ir? the United States
by all persons abroad with whom
trade is authorized by the said
action, and such new credits or
assets will not be taken over by
the United States Alien Prop
erty Custodian.
"The foregoing action does
not, of course, modify the pres
ent prohibition against trade
with that part of Russia which
is under Bolshevik control.
With respect to all of the fore
going action, the right is re
served to revive all or any part
of the previous enemy trade re
strictions, if thfi same should
become necessary." .

WORLD'S FAIR MINE IN COURT.
Frank and Josephine Powers Ask
for Appointment of Receiver.
Last Tuesday there was filed
in the Superior Court of Santa
Cruz county, a suit where Frank
and Josephine Powers are plain
tiffs, with A. A. Holland, James
Emery and Hiram Whitcomb. as
defendants. It is an action for
appointment of a receiver for
the World's Pair mines, situated
in the Harshaw district, this
county, one of the famous silver
bonanzas in Arizona, and many
years known as "Prank Powers'
Bank."
The complaint recites that in
April, 1918, plaintiffs, who have
operated the properties many
years, entered into a contract
with depefendant, A. A. Hoi
land, for a sale of the mines -under
a bond and lease, under the
terms of which contract said
Holland was to enter into pos
session of the properties, work
them in a mining like manner,
erect a good and suitable mill
for concentration of the ores,
and make certain payments on
the purchase price.
The complaint alleges further,
it is said, that defendant Hol
land, made over to the other de
fendants, Hiram Whitcomb and
James Emery, an interest each
in said contract, and that the
three are thus made parties in
the action.
The complaint recites further
that the terms of the contract
with Holland are not being car
ried out by defendants; that the
mill erected is not suitable for
the work intended, that its ope
ration does not save all the val
ues it should, that two of the
defendants and others, are paid
excessive salaries, that the de-
ing carried forward, and other
allegations are made, all of
which are summed up in an alle
gation that unless relief is
granted, the property may be
dissipated, for which reason ap
pointment of a receiver is asked

CONARD FARMING IN SONORA.
Yesterday, (April 26) Mr. A.
Conard, a former resident of
Nogales, who lives now in Los
Angeles, having heavy lauded
and mining interests in Sonora,
who had arrived from the south
Friday evening, toook the" train
to Tucson, en route home for a
short visit, but he expects to re
turn to Sonora within a week or
so, bis extensive interests re
quiring his attention, says the
Oasis.
In conversation with the Oasis
reporter Mr. Conard stated that
the farmers he has been intro
ducing upon the large tract of
land he purchased several years
ago, in the vicinity of Noria
station, on the line of the South
ern Pacific of Mexico, about
seventy five miles south from
Nogales, are pushing their work
of cultivation with all energy,
and that there will be a large
acreage planted before the sum
mer rains come along. He has
located e'ght actual cultivators,
and expects to have twenty-five
or thirty before the season ends.
There are four tractors there in
operation at the present time,
and Mr. Conard stated that the
fifth is at Nogales now. It will
be sent across the line Monday
and will go to .Noria by the first
train going in that direction af
ter that day.
Beans, the chief crop that is
planting not only the ordinary
pink bean of Mexico but castor
beans, which will, grow there in
great profusion, and are a very
profitable crop.
For raising beans the land is
plowed and harrowed thorough
ly and the seed planted, and the
summer rains bring on the young
plants. In the fall the beans
are harvested, and ttoe same
land then seeded in wheat, as a
winter crop.
The lands mentioned are upon
the great mesa extending south
from Llano to Pesqueira, a dis
tance of about 100 miles, which,
is skirted on either side by
mountain ranges. It is a feVtile
region, and work such as that
done by Mr. Conard is bringing
it out as one of great natural
adaptability.
Mr. Conard stated that be
finds conditions in Sonora as
very satisfactory. Every atten
tion is given by officials and
those in business to the needs
and requirements of those in
vesting and improving the re
sources of the State, and all are
doing everything possible to
preserve friendly , relations with
foreigners coming into the coun
try for investment. (
