The Spirit of Friendship.
This store looks upon its patrons not
merely as customers but as friends.
People purchase here because they
have friendly feeling for this store.
The cause which develops this f riendly
feeling, may differ, in fact, they are
sure to differ. One's friendship for
the store is the result of finding good
values; another's is the result of effi
cient service and courteous treatment,
and so on.
Naturally this friendshiply feeling on
the part of our patrons is reciprocated,
on our part. And this sjirit of mutual
friendship is an impetus for greater
service and an incentive to ever-increasing
endeavor to make this store
a place where every visitor will feel
perfectly at home.

the Texas legislature to pass
legislation controlling the in
spection of cattle similar to the
one now in effect in New Mexico.
This was decided at a meeting
of the executive committee of
the Association held at El Paso
Jan. 28. Arrangements were
also made for the annual Asso
ciation convention to be held
here March 4th, 5th and 6th.
Badges were adopted and a
tentative program arranged.
The Association includes in its
membership cattlemen from Ari

large number of cattlemen to
sell them hides for which they
pay with check. Later the checks
turn out to be worthless. One
cattleman, Richard M. Johnson

On Tuesday the Arizona legis

der a series of suspensions of

senate where similar action was
taken upon it The resolution
approves the plan of Secretary
of the Interior Franklin K. Lane
for establishing a land policy
under the soldier settlement act.
There is now pending cited the
resolution, a bill appropriating
$100,000,000 to carry out the pur
poses of the act which are to
reclaim 215,000,000 acres of arid
and swamp lands on which 100.
(KM) men may be established on
25,000 farms, under a self fund

resolution urges the congress to
pass the bill promptly Messenger.
That there will be no general
extension of time beyond March
15th for the tiling of returns and
for the payment of Income and
Excess Profits taxes due on that
date, is the decision of Daniel C.
Roper, Commissioner of Internal
Revenue. The announcement
was made today by Collector
Franklin immediately following
the approval by the Senate and
House of the report of the Con
ferees on the new Revenue Bill.
"It is necessary to get the in
itial tax payments in by March
3 5th," says Commissioner Roper.
"No other course is possible.
Some months ago, the Treasury
issued certificates of indebted
ness to an amount approximat
ing $800,000,000, maturing March
15th. The first payment of the
Income and Excess Profits Taxes
for 1918 was planned for that
date, to meet this huge obliga
tion. The American people have
proven that there is no emer
gency too great to be met and
solved by cooperation. This
present situation is another em
ergency which can be overcome
by cooperative effort. The
Bureau extends its every force
toward this end, and I am rely
ing upon the people to meet the
situation whole heartedly.
The Internal Revenue Bureau
must carry out the program pre
scribed in the new law, which
requires all returns for 1918 to
be filed on or beiore March 15tb,
1919, and requires the first
quarterly payment or the entire
payment to be made on or before
that date.
Every taxpayer who can pos
sibly do so is urged to make full
payment of bis income tax on or
before March 15tb. The quart
erly payment method is intend
ed for taxpayers whose financ
ing of the tax at one time would
tend to upset local financial con
ditions. The approval of the report of
the conferees by the Senate and
House of Representatives brings
the new Revenue Bill to the
point where it may be said to be
a law. The Internal Revenue
Bureau has been making pre
parations to collect the taxes
which it provides, and is now
putting all of its efforts into
aiding the taxpayers to fulfill
the obligations imposed.
The Bureau has arranged to
send an advisory force of sev
eral thousands of deputies and
agents to assist taxpayers. These
officers will be stationed at con
venient points where they may
be consulted without charge.
Taxpayers should take the in
itiative and get in touch with
these Revenue men for any
needed advice and assistance in
preparing returns.
The forms for the tax returns
are being printed and all forms
will be in the hands of Collect
ors between February 15th and
March 1st."

New Book Codifies State Labor Laws
The labor laws of Arizona are
to be annotated and codified au
cording to a statement made by
Thomas J. Croaff, member -of
the Phoenix law firm of S wen
son and Croaff.
The new volume being issued
will be from the pen of Mr.
Croaff who is, without doubt, the
best authority in Arizona on
legal questions affecting labor
and industrial matters. Mr.
Croaff is Federal Director of
labor for Arizona and president
of the State Federation of Labor
as well as a lawyer of eight
years' experience at the bar in
Virginia, New Mexico and Ari
zona. "The new volume of labor
laws, when issued," said Mr.
Croaff, "will contain all of Ari
zona's labor laws, including safe
ty laws, minimum wage, em
ployment of women, employer's
liability and workmen's compen
sation laws, which will be stated
in simple and concise language
understandable by the layman,
both worker and employer."
The volume will be issued
promptly after the adjournment
of the present session of the
legislature, in order to include
such labor laws as may be en
acted at this session. Sun.
The following is quoted from
a notice issued by tne secretary
of the treasury :
1. "My attention has been
directed to the numerous offers
made by unscrupulous persons
through advertisement to buy
War Savings Certificate Stamps
and, as a result of such offers, I
am informed that owners of such
securities have suffered material
losses which could have been
avoided by redemption of the
War Savings Certificate Stamps
at the post offices, as provided
by law."
"In order that the interests of
owners of War Savings Certifi
cate Stamps of either series may
be safeguarded, I hereby notify
all persons to refrain from offers
to buy War Savings Stamps or
accept the same in trade."
2. In pursuance of the fore
going, postmasters are directed
not to pay war savings ceitifi
cates on which the names of the
owners have not been entered
or have been erased or changed;
since, under the regulations,
they are not transferable, and
ar6 payable only to the original
owners, except in case of death
or disability.
3. Postmaster are further in
structed not to pay and war sav
ings certificates presented by
persons or firms known to be
buying, or publicly offering to
buy, war savings stamps or cer
tificates from the owners, unless
positive evidence is submitted
that the certificates were origin
ally issued to the persons or
firms presenting them for pay
ment. 4. When consulted by owners
of war savings stamps in regard
to offers to purchase such stamps
at less than current value, post
masters should invite their at
tention to the fact that war sav
ings certificates may be cashed
at money order post offices after
ten days' written notice, and
that this is a privilege accorded
by law. At the same time it
should be pointed out that the
need of the government for the
proceeds of the war savings
stamp issue is great, and the
holders should be urged to re
tain their stamps until maturity
as a patriotic act unless their
necessities are urgent.
(Signed) A. M. DOCKEKY,

General."
PATAGONIAN CHANGES OWNERS
Howard Keener, in last week's
Santa Cruz PatagODian says:
"With this issue of the Pata
gonian Howard Keener bids yon
farewell and extends thanks for
your support and patronage.
"The Patagonian has done
well during my ownership, con
sidering the limited field, and I
am retiring from the business
for the reason that my other in
terests need my attention and
have been neglected too much,
in the past.
"The new owner. Mr. H. T.
Wilson, is a newspaper man of
j wide experience, and undoubted
ly will make make many im
j provements ia the paper, as be
will be able to give it his entire
attention, which, I am sorry to
say, I have not been able to do.
Mr. Wilson is not an entire
stranger to you, having been en
gaged in ranching in this neigh
borhood for the last nine years.
"The Patagonian deserves
your support because it is an
asset to your town and gives it
advertising that it could not get
without it. As I said on a for
mer occasion, it is an institution,
not a business, and an institu
tion of Patagonia.
"If you will give to Mr. Wil
son the same consideration yon
have given me and assist him
with your patronage and news
contributions, the Patagonian
will continue to be an asset to
the town.
"I wish you all health, wealth
and happiness."
Exaggeration in complaints
against the railroad administra
tion, growing out of the differ
ences in conditions now and in
war times, is making it difficult
to solve the problem of the rail
roads, according to Director of
Railroads Hines, in a statement
before the Senate committee of
investigation.
MAY BUY THREE-R MINE.
For several days there have
been representatives of the Gug
genheimers at theThree-R mine
taking samples, with the inten
tion of purchasing the property
if it turns out to be as rich as
reported, says the Santa Cruz
Patagonian.
We are sure the would be pur
chasers will find the property of
sufficient value to invest their
money in it.
The 3 R is one of the best
copper properties in this dis
trict. Its former operators have
taken immense sums from it,
and it still has much wealth to
uncover. The Guggenheimers
are big operators, and their ad
vent into the district would be a
good thing for the county, and
the Patagonia district.
Some time ago it was rumored
the Magma Copper Company
would become interested in the
3 R but the deal, it is reported,
has fallen through for some ua-
I known reason.
) Either the Magma or the Gug-
genheim interests will be wel-
come to this community. CHAMBER OF COMMERCE.

PROPOSED STOCK YARDS.
Yesterday (Wednesday) even
ing there was held a meeting of
the Nogales Town Council, call
ed for conference with regard to
a site for a stockyard and ship
ping pens for the Southern Pa
cific Company.
It will be recalled that a couple
of years ago the Town Board
ordered out of town the old
stockyards just below the round
house; and since that time all
cattle shipments have had to go
to the Calabasas yards. For
greater convenience to the com
pany and the cattle shippers, it
is desirable that the yards and
pens shall be closer to town.
When the old pens were remov
ed it was suggested that the
town lease the company ground
on the sewer farm, to put up a
new plant there.
At the meeting yesterday even
ing there were present Mayor
Fiedler, Councilmen Harrison,
Dunbar and Frd.
Division Engineer Edwards of
the S. P. appeared belore the
board and presented an inquiry
whether the town would lease
for stockyard purposes two acres
in the sewer farm, immediately
south from the old pumping
plant. He presented a blue print
showing just what it is proposed
to lease.
After considerable discussion
the Council adopted a resolution
tendering the company the two
acres described, for a period of
!' years at a rental to be agreed
upon later, the land to revert to
the town if abandoned for the
purpose stated.
In the course of the informal
discussion it was stated that the
company will expend at least
$12,000 on the proposed improve
ment. Oasis.
PROCLAMATION.
America is responding in a
characteristically generous man
ner to the appeal for the relief
of war ridden and famine strick
en Armenians and other races in
the Near East. The magazines
and pa peril have reported the
unparalleled distress and perse
cutions of these people, and the
knowledge that these races will
be practically exterminated un
less aided, has caused a united
effort in their behalf. Under the
supervision of our Government
a united drive is now being made
and will be continued until the
17th of this month for the relief
of these peoples.
Nojrales has made a record
during the war, of which we are
all proud. Our boys in Service
have shown themselves brave
and self sacrificing, and the civi
lians at home have participated
in all the drives and war work
in which their support has been
asked. Nogales has been over
the top time after time in war
work. We cannot refuse now to
join in the general effort for tbe
benefit, of these races. They
have suffered under greater per
secutions and endured more ex
treme hardships than any other
peoples during tbe World War.
The Turkish Nation has again
merited the name of the "Un
speakable Turk" in their fiendish
efforts to exterminate these peo
ples, and only the generous aid
of America can prevent the suc
cess of those efforts.
We in Nogales must again con
tribute our small part toward
the glorious total of America's
bounty. Knowing the record of
the people of Nogales, I am sure
that it is only necessary for me
to call this work of saving
human life to the attention of
the people of Nogales, and at
the request of the leaders in
this work, and in common with
the Governor of our State and
the Mayors of the other cities,
I, George H. Fiedler, Mayor of
the Town of Nogales, Arizona,
by virtue of the authority vested
in me by law and at the direc
tion of tbe Common Council, call
upon and urge the inhabitants
of the Town of Nogales during
the remainder of the week of
February 10th to 17th, 1919, de
signated and set aside as Cam
paign Week for relief in the
Near East to contribute liberally
to this cause, and to put Noga
les "Over the Top" as in other
drives for the cause of world
humanity.
In Witness Whereof, I have
hereunto set my hand this 13th
day of February, 1919.
G. H. Fiedler,
Mayor of the Town of
Nogales, Arizona.
STATEMENT FROM BANKS.
February 11, 1919. .
At a meeting held pn the 10th
instant, all of the banks of No
gales, have adopted the rule
that from and after March 1,
1919, they will not, when pur
chasing County warrants of San
ta Cruz county, pay more than
ninety (90) per cent of tbe face
value of such warrants, and not
more than ninety six (96) p6r
cent of the face value of war
rants of the Town of Nogales,
Arizona.
The Banks were obliged to
take this action by reason of the
large debts with the County and
Town are now carrying and the
likelihood that neither of those
municipal corporations will be
able in the near future to liqui
date the floating indebtedness
which they are now carrying.

RAILROAD WINS DAMAGE SUIT.
That a Maricopa county jury
will not award damages to a
man whom it believes nas not
been injured, was demonstrated
when a verdict for the defendant
was returned in the $15,000
action brought by Frank Steven
son against the Arizona E.isteru
Railroad company.
The jury was out less than
ten minutes, the first ballot re
suiting in 11 to 1 for judgment
for the defendant, the next bal
lot making it unanimous for the
company.
Stevenson claimed to have
been injured in April when he
fell against an excavation, the
fall being caused by stubbing
his toes. He was at that time
employed by the Arizona Fast
ern, and time cards showed that
he did not lose a day's work
after the alleged injury, for
which he brought suit for S15,
000. He continued in. the em
ploy of the company eight
months after he struck his toe,
and left only when his wages
were not raised at his request.
Stevenson was forced to sub
mit to a severe cross-examina
tion by George Purdy Bullard
during the course of the trial,
Mr. Bullard showing where
Stevenson drew accident insur
ance while at work for the com

RED CROSS FIGHTS
DEADLY EPIDEMIC
Besides the special work conducted
by hundreds of Ited Cross Chap'TB
throughout the country In checking
the recent epidemic of Spunish Influ
enza, the orsrnniisation through it
headquarters at Washington is prepar
ing to fight a repetition of the experi
ence that was so disastrous this fall,
educating the puhlic thoroughly re
garding the symptoms and the proper
care at the beginning of an attack. In
addition to this, the American Hed
'Cross is fighting tuberculosis. The re
cent appropriation to the National Tu
jbercnlosiis Association will he used for
educational as well as relief work
throughout the country.
So much has been said ahottt the
aftermath of the epidemic that espe
cial attention is being given to the
work along this line. The weakness
which follows influenza leaves the pa
'tieot In a condition which makes him
a good field for the germs of tubercu
losis. A thorough physical examina
tion, proper food and clothing, the use
'of mild preventives, will check the
ijrogress of the disease Ttt once.
Tuberculosis, or consumption, as It
lis frequently called, is both preventa
'ble and curable, provided the treat
ment of the disease Is begun before It
ls too far advanced. Medicine plays a
comparatively small part. The fre
quently advertised 'consumption
cures" should be looked -upon as pol
jaon. The only medicine which should
be taken Is a good tonic which will
Stimulate the appetite and build up
.the system generally. The main cure
'lies in proper food, sufficient rest,
ifresh air and sunlight and living, if
possible, according to the
seribed by a good physician
news the patient's vitality
kills the disease entirely.
For several years the National Tn
bereulosis Association has been financ
Mng Its wo. k by the sale of lied Cross
seals at Christmas time. The seals
sold for a penny each and by making
a concerted effort enough money was
usually raised to carry the work
through the year. This year there will
be no seals sold because the American
Ked Cross has made an appropriation
for the anti-tuberculosis work, and
those who formerly sent their time
selling seals will join in the work for
the Ued Cross Christmas Itoll Call
during the week of December 1J to 23.
